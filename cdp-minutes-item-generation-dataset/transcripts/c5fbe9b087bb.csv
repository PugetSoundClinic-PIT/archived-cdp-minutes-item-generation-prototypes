24,0.97,63.53,64.864,"Thank you very much, here.",19,,
25,0.97,64.864,67.734,Nine present.,20,,
26,0.97,67.734,70.136,"Thank you very much, Madam clerk.",21,,
27,0.97,70.136,71.971,Thank you colleagues for your time today.,21,,
28,0.97,71.971,83.683,"We have hopefully three hours to get through next 30 items, so I'll ask folks to be brief in their comments, and I'm going to be timing so we can keep an equal amount of time for each item.",21,,
29,0.97,83.683,89.989,"I know not everything will take the same amount of town, but to keep us moving, I'd love to do that.",21,,
30,0.97,89.989,95.929,We'll get through the Hsd section and then the Oig before the SPD section.,21,,
31,0.97,95.929,102.502,We will accommodate Council member Sawant's request to have her item go first before we begin with the SPD related items.,21,,
32,0.97,102.502,108.708,I believe that will all be able to be accomplished within the next hour before Council member Sawant needs to depart.,21,,
33,0.97,108.708,120.32,I want to thank you all for the time you've taken today to walk through the over 20 items so far.,21,,
34,0.97,120.32,130.697,We are on Hom013A001.,21,,
35,0.97,141.074,146.012,"Jeff, it looks like we have screen sharing up, so thank you for being with us.",21,,
36,0.97,146.012,159.058,"Thank you, we're an item number 21 on the agenda which is Hom13A1.",22,,
37,0.97,159.058,163.029,It provides money for the human services Department for properties of shelter and housing.,22,,
38,0.97,163.029,171.437,"I want to be clear, the funds provided here are different from the funds discussed for Provisos just a moment ago.",22,,
39,0.97,171.437,179.245,"Earlier today we talked a lot about emergency solution, grant funds and Provisos there.",22,,
40,0.97,179.245,186.286,"In addition, the 2021 proposed budget uses $10 million from the joint Covid compromise agreement to increase services.",22,,
41,0.97,186.286,194.193,8 million of that is for rental assistance and homelessness prevention.,22,,
42,0.97,194.193,210.71,"This proviso applies to those funds, and clarifies that funds can't only be used for private services but also the acquisition of properties.",22,,
43,0.97,210.71,217.116,Either for emergency shelter or Non-Congregate shelters and things like that.,22,,
44,0.97,217.116,218.017,Chair Mosqueda is the sponsor.,22,,
45,0.97,218.017,256.189,"Yes, similar to the comments made from the other Council members, we know that acquiring hotels is a really important to strategically use it to further provide additional shelter options, and hopefully at some point longer term housing strategies for those that need stable housing.",23,,
46,0.97,256.189,261.761,"There is, as we know, $8 million in rental assistance and homelessness prevention included in the Mayor's budget.",23,,
47,0.97,261.761,270.47,This reflects the agreed upon discussion we had with the executive in the summer as it related to the relief that we were offering.,23,,
48,0.97,270.47,276.609,This proviso here uses the proviso as a place holder to expand the eligible uses of the $8 million for acquisition.,23,,
49,0.97,276.609,279.579,I want to note that this is a starting point.,23,,
50,0.97,279.579,310.276,"Obviously we all know that we need additional funds, but when hotels become available or vacant buildings become available that are suitable for a Noncongregate shelter, it would be ideal to have additional funds to rely on, especially with winter around the corner making those experiencing homelessness even more vulnerable to Covid and the elements, the ability to get individuals into individual rooms has been shown to be a successful model for outreach and engagement.",23,,
51,0.97,310.276,321.387,They're more likely to come in when they know they have a hotel room or individual room that's an option versus congregate settings or other types of shelter options.,23,,
52,0.97,321.387,327.727,We put this forward in a partnership with central staff and some of the good ideas they had to really identify a place holder.,23,,
53,0.97,327.727,340.139,"Through very much Jeff for your work with our office, to leave open the possibility of increasing funds for not just rental assist, but adding acquisition into the mix for additional dollars.",23,,
54,0.97,340.139,342.508,Just a place holder for now.,23,,
55,0.97,342.508,359.258,But look forward to working with all of you as we continue to expand the type of housing and shelter options that we know are Evidence-Based and really do further our goals towards getting more folks off the streets into stable housing.,23,,
56,0.97,359.258,373.039,"I want to thank Council members Lewis and Morales for Cosponsorship, and I'll also thank Council member Sawant and Strauss for adding their names here.",23,,
57,0.97,373.039,374.407,Any additional questions at this point?,23,,
58,0.97,374.407,376.075,"Okay, thank you colleagues and Jeff.",23,,
59,0.97,376.075,377.377,Let's go ahead and move on.,23,,
60,0.97,377.377,382.915,Next item number 22 on the agenda is Hom14A1.,24,,
61,0.97,382.915,399.465,"This adds $750,000 in general fund one time funding to Hsd to increase funding to maintain rapid Rehousing case loads.",24,,
62,0.97,399.465,401.467,Council member Herbold alluded to this in previous comments.,24,,
63,0.97,401.467,418.117,"It's said it's taking longer for families already enrolled to transition into self-sufficiency and not receive the rapid Rehousing support, so this would provide additional funds so that services could last for a longer period of time.",24,,
64,0.97,418.117,431.597,"This is a distinct approach from the 2020-2021 proposed budget where we have the rapid Rehousing programs like is discused here, but the 2021 budget also has a separate pot of funds for a one time expansion of rapid Rehousing.",24,,
65,0.97,431.597,454.754,"Looking at the basic numbers because this is just based on averages of how much support and dollar wise and also how long, we'd probably be talking about another 256 months of support allotted across a lot of different households, so some households might need another two months, some might need ten.",24,,
66,0.97,454.754,463.696,But this is roughly how you can think about what kind of increase you're purchasing with this kind of change.,24,,
67,0.97,463.696,469.335,Sponge so sponsor is Council member Herbold.,24,,
68,0.97,469.335,470.536,And cosponsors Gonzalez and Lewis.,25,,
69,0.97,470.536,479.245,"Our prime sponsor has been dropped from the zoom, so if our team from Tech can see if she's trying to be admitted, that would be helpful.",25,,
70,0.97,479.245,497.196,Also Council member Strauss is interested in signing as a cosponsor.,25,,
71,0.97,497.196,501.2,Do we have any technical questions Jeff could address?,25,,
72,0.97,501.2,504.103,"Okay, so I'm seeing no additional technical questions.",25,,
73,0.97,504.103,508.407,Let's go ahead and add Council member Strauss as a cosponsor just for visual purposes.,25,,
74,0.97,508.407,509.542,Thank you so much.,25,,
75,0.97,509.542,527.426,"And we will, um, come back to this when Council member Herbold has joined us again so we can make sure to answer any questions and give her a chance to explain the dock document.",25,,
76,0.97,527.426,530.129,"That sound good, Jeff?",25,,
77,0.97,530.129,532.098,That sounds great.,26,,
78,0.97,532.098,534.133,Great.,27,,
79,0.97,534.133,534.533,"One second, Jeff.",27,,
80,0.97,534.533,534.734,Okay.,27,,
81,0.97,534.734,545.244,Let's go ahead and go to the next one and come back to this item.,27,,
82,0.97,545.244,556.989,"Next item, 23, is Cbahom15A1 that proposes a proviso for general fund one time resources for Hsd homelessness prevention and rental assistance to be used for families with School-Aged children --",28,,
83,0.97,556.989,563.162,"Hold on just a second, Jeff if I could interrupt you just because we're only on the first sentence.",29,,
84,0.97,563.162,566.065,Can we go back to the last slide?,29,,
85,0.97,566.065,567.767,"Council member Herbold, welcome back.",29,,
86,0.97,567.767,575.174,You'll be happy to know in the meantime you gained a cosponsor.,29,,
87,0.97,575.174,576.576,"Just for the viewing public, we're on Hom14A001.",29,,
88,0.97,578.21,580.646,Please go ahead with any description you'd like to add.,29,,
89,0.97,580.646,584.116,"Thank you so much, and I'm so sorry.",30,,
90,0.97,584.116,588.187,Appreciate you rolling with the technical difficulties on my end.,30,,
91,0.97,588.187,608.674,So my office was contacted by rapid Rehousing providers who specialize in families due to the unique impact of the pandemic and economic downturn on the families that they're currently serving and the cost per household to help families exit to permanent housing is skyrocketing.,30,,
92,0.97,608.674,610.71,It's costing almost double per family.,30,,
93,0.97,610.71,616.215,"For the viewing public, rapid Rehousing helps those experiencing homelessness find and keep a home.",30,,
94,0.97,616.215,639.205,"Over a period of months, it provides a rent subsidy pack packaged with case management allowing a family to move into a stable home earlier instead of languishing in a shelter or car, and giving time and support to help them find a job and build resources before taking on the full cost of a lease.",30,,
95,0.97,639.205,651.951,"Families are vulnerable to the pandemic and economic downturn, and unique ways they're taking parents to find jobs and the amount of time until they can fully afford their own rent.",30,,
96,0.97,651.951,662.061,"Families tend to need apartments with more bedrooms, which are more expensive, and many families are reluctant to accept positions that expose them and their children to Coronavirus every day.",30,,
97,0.97,662.061,684.65,"Parents are finding it difficult to find and afford child care for school aged children who are remote learning, and so they can leave the house for a job, and of course like many Seattle residents, parents who had a job, lost their job, when the pandemic hit, there are fewer job openings now, and it's taking parents longer to find employment.",30,,
98,0.97,684.65,695.194,"Because of these unique circumstances, rapid Rehousing providers are running out of funds to serve the families that are currently enrolled in rapid Rehousing.",30,,
99,0.97,695.194,702.668,"Without support, every single one of these families is at risk of losing their housing and falling back into homelessness.",30,,
100,0.97,702.668,717.583,"So my office spoke with rapid Rehousing providers at each well spring, solid ground, interim, Seattle Indian health board, and the chief Seattle club.",30,,
101,0.97,717.583,722.688,Some of those providers have already Prespent 2021 funds in order to keep supporting families.,30,,
102,0.97,722.688,737.336,Those able to rapidly calculate their costs indicated that's costing 1.75 to 2 times the usual amount for families to housing right now.,30,,
103,0.97,737.336,740.339,I'm happy to share the numbers with Council members interested.,30,,
104,0.97,740.339,749.281,All have expressed desire to keep supporting these families and their belief that with extra time the families will be able to successfully exit permanent housing.,30,,
105,0.97,749.281,774.173,"This is a one time funding request to acknowledge the unique burdens on this moment on families who have only recently escaped homelessness and may fall into it again without additional assistance, and thank you to original cosponsors Lewis and Gonzalez and thank you to Council members Strauss and Pederson who have signed on.",30,,
106,0.97,774.173,777.343,Thank you for that summary.,31,,
107,0.97,777.343,787.787,"You also gained a cosponsor in your explanation, so thank you very much.",31,,
108,0.97,787.787,790.99,"No questions before, any questions now?",31,,
109,0.97,790.99,791.29,Wonderful.,31,,
110,0.97,791.29,792.224,Thank you very much.,31,,
111,0.97,792.224,796.195,"Jeff, let's continue with your explanation of this item.",31,,
112,0.97,796.195,801.1,"Sure, we're on item number 23.",32,,
113,0.97,801.1,801.433,Cbahom15A1.,32,,
114,0.97,801.433,822.388,"This imposes a proviso on the jump start Covid funds that are proposed in the 2021 budget so that $400,000 in those one time funds would be used for serving families that have school aged children or children in child care with the homelessness prevention or rapid Rehousing funds.",32,,
115,0.97,822.388,827.826,"Again, just to make sure we're crisp and clear about the differences in funding, this morning we talked a lot about Esg.",32,,
116,0.97,827.826,833.399,"The one we just went over is joint Covid funds, and this one is as well.",32,,
117,0.97,833.399,837.97,The primary sponsor is Council President Gonzalez.,32,,
118,0.97,837.97,838.337,Thank you.,33,,
119,0.97,838.337,838.904,Council President Gonzalez?,33,,
120,0.97,838.904,839.805,Thank you so much chair Mosqueda.,34,,
121,0.97,839.805,847.513,"The good news here is that this is a proviso, so it's not additional revenue.",34,,
122,0.97,847.513,875.441,It's just a request to use the dollars that currently exist for direct rental assistance to have some targeted and focused investments that are going to be critical to ensuring that families with school aged children have access to secure housing as we know that housing instability can have a negative impact on a student's ability to learn whether it's in early learning or the K through 12 system.,34,,
123,0.97,875.441,884.55,This item is designed to ensure that existing rental dollars will be deployed in the manner that Jeff just described.,34,,
124,0.97,884.55,901.567,"This pandemic, of course, has magnified the inequities that Purvey in our communities, including housing security, when in Seattle all learning is done remotely, and with our ongoing inability to fully meet the needs of families with child care and early learning needs.",34,,
125,0.97,901.567,922.321,"Through the family education funding, we secured funding for the city's first time investment in student homelessness and housing stability for children in our public schools experiencing housing insecurity including an ongoing contribution to child care resources to provide ongoing child care services for families experiencing homelessness.",34,,
126,0.97,922.321,937.236,"What we learn through that process and our partnership with Seattle public school, the data shows that students impacted by housing and security are Disproportionally black, indigenous, and Latin X.",34,,
127,0.97,937.236,946.645,"It can lead to lower graduation rates, and graduation is often cited as a Protecter against adult and youth homelessness.",34,,
128,0.97,946.645,960.759,"We hope to build upon the stability work currently undergoing through the Department of early education and learning, and these investments recognize that students rely on stable housing during the pandemic for the Online schooling to be successful.",34,,
129,0.97,960.759,972.438,"By helping families stay housed, we're trying to minimize the disruptions to education and long term success of our youngest learners throughout the city and their families.",34,,
130,0.97,972.438,978.377,And I appreciate the support of my colleagues that have popped up as I'm making my comments.,34,,
131,0.97,978.377,982.581,I really appreciate it and know the families of Seattle do as well.,34,,
132,0.97,982.581,983.982,"Thank you, Council President.",35,,
133,0.97,983.982,990.456,"As you noted, um, all additional Council members are listed.",35,,
134,0.97,990.456,994.994,"Council members Herbold, Morales, Sawant, Pederson, Juarez, Strauss, and Lewis signed on as cosponsors.",35,,
135,0.97,994.994,997.596,Really appreciate you bringing this forward.,35,,
136,0.97,997.596,1011.443,"I think you mentioned it in your comments, and just to remind folks again Pre-Covid how many kids did we have in the school S█Ystem already facing homelessness?",35,,
137,0.97,1011.443,1012.544,"Wasn't it 1 in 10, something like that?",35,,
138,0.97,1012.544,1039.338,"I don't want the statistic off the top of my head, but it was pretty significant, so there's also within the public school system, um, a segment of students, children, who aren't even counted as housing, as homeless because they're doubled up, so they're living with aunts and uncles or in other Cohabitation settings.",36,,
139,0.97,1039.338,1045.477,"So they're housing unstable, but not necessarily homeless.",36,,
140,0.97,1045.477,1060.259,"So I think that, um, our deal really focuses on that population where there's a large amount of public school students in that doubled up category in addition to those experiencing actual homelessness.",36,,
141,0.97,1060.259,1083.882,"And again, this sort of targeted strategy to encumber $400,000 of rental assistance money will layer on top of the prior city investments to hopefully get to all the different categories of children and their families who experience either homelessness or housing insecurity and instability.",36,,
142,0.97,1083.882,1085.084,Very well said.,37,,
143,0.97,1085.084,1087.286,Thank you very much.,37,,
144,0.97,1087.286,1087.82,No additional comments.,37,,
145,0.97,1087.82,1092.057,Let's go to the next one.,37,,
146,0.97,1092.057,1100.065,Next item is Hom16A1 adding money to fully fund the landlord liaison program.,38,,
147,0.97,1100.065,1103.068,Most typically we think of housing Connector program.,38,,
148,0.97,1103.068,1112.978,"For context for the Council, the housing Connector program has a base contract that previously would have gone through all home.",38,,
149,0.97,1112.978,1126.525,"As we transition to having a regional authority that transitions out of being a separate entity, Hsd anticipates needing to initially take on the contract track directly.",38,,
150,0.97,1126.525,1131.597,"That direct contract, base amount is $470,000, somewhere in that range.",38,,
151,0.97,1131.597,1133.532,That is what was initially discussed.,38,,
152,0.97,1133.532,1140.038,But I understand the amount actually provided is a little lower than that.,38,,
153,0.97,1140.038,1140.405,"$34,000 less.",38,,
154,0.97,1140.405,1144.409,And so this action would fill in that base amount.,38,,
155,0.97,1144.409,1161.593,"In addition to whatever the base amount would end up being, because of the emergency solutions grant funds from this morning, that would support Noncongregate shelter and hotels expanding so much with rapid Rehousing.",38,,
156,0.97,1161.593,1176.074,"There's a substantial investment and also $250,000 provided to the housing Connector to add two more FTE and assist with some of the capacity and placement of families receiving assistance through the rapid Rehousing.",38,,
157,0.97,1176.074,1187.319,"So there's the base contract that would fill in what they planned for initially with the base contract, and then the additional expansion that the budget already provides.",38,,
158,0.97,1187.319,1188.787,Primary sponsor here is Council member Herbold.,38,,
159,0.97,1188.787,1189.221,Thank you.,39,,
160,0.97,1189.221,1192.057,Council member Herbold?,39,,
161,0.97,1192.057,1194.259,Thank you so much.,40,,
162,0.97,1194.259,1199.198,I'm so excited about the progress this program has made.,40,,
163,0.97,1199.198,1208.941,Some of you might remember it is a landlord liaison program that's now called housing Connector.,40,,
164,0.97,1208.941,1210.209,Thank you to cosponsors Strauss and Lewis.,40,,
165,0.97,1210.209,1225.991,"This is a modest request to fully fund a program that's not only doing incredible work, but it fills an important gap in preventing Evictions and helping more people experiencing homelessness find housing.",40,,
166,0.97,1225.991,1232.331,The housing Connector makes connections between landlords and households with rental barriers.,40,,
167,0.97,1232.331,1247.312,"It provides financial support and risk mitigation for landlords so take an tenants experiencing homelessness and provides ongoing support to landlords, tenants, and providers over the course of their tenancy.",40,,
168,0.97,1247.312,1260.158,They're in their second year of service as being known as the housing Connector program after revamping the old program.,40,,
169,0.97,1260.158,1272.237,"In the first full year, they housed 1,170 people with 96% of the people still housed, only one Eviction, and 70% of those housed are people of color.",40,,
170,0.97,1272.237,1277.409,"They established partnership with 470 properties, offering more than 26,000 units.",40,,
171,0.97,1277.409,1288.687,"About 40% are owned by small landlords, and they're working with 58 different Nonprofits with 550 case managers with access to this rental platform.",40,,
172,0.97,1288.687,1303.268,This is intended to play a key role in serving up to 231 households moving into temporary hotels in 2021 as part of the Mayor's proposed housing surge.,40,,
173,0.97,1303.268,1311.877,The housing Connector will support households enrolled in rapid Rehousing as we seek to leave the hotel shelter behind and support themselves in their own permanent homes.,40,,
174,0.97,1311.877,1331.229,"In discussions with the city about that expansion and the specific role, housing Connector's executive director understood they'd get $470,000 a year, but the proposed budget is 34,000 short of that amount.",40,,
175,0.97,1331.229,1340.806,"While the gap is a small amount, they're also fighting for adequate funding from the county in 2021.",40,,
176,0.97,1340.806,1352.351,"The cities and households experiencing homelessness need housing Connector to function at full capacity in 2021, a year we expect to see significant increases in Evictions when the housing Moratorum ends.",40,,
177,0.97,1352.351,1368.767,"It will be a critical Player in ensuring individuals maintain housing stability and for families that lose housing, it will provide housing options that reduce and waived screening criteria such as a credit score or past Eviction barriers.",40,,
178,0.97,1368.767,1375.44,So families can quickly access a home and not fall into extended periods of homelessness.,40,,
179,0.97,1375.44,1377.042,"It's a small, but vital investment.",40,,
180,0.97,1377.042,1378.844,Thank you.,40,,
181,0.97,1378.844,1383.882,And I have received notification that Council member Juarez would like to sign on.,41,,
182,0.97,1383.882,1390.455,I see Council President Gonzalez and member Pederson also signing on.,41,,
183,0.97,1390.455,1395.794,Any additional questions for Council member Herbold?,41,,
184,0.97,1395.794,1396.094,Wonderful.,41,,
185,0.97,1396.094,1407.272,"Council member Herbold, you have Pederson, Juarez, Strauss, Lewis, and Council President Gonzalez as cosponsors.",41,,
186,0.97,1407.272,1408.373,Let's go on.,41,,
187,0.97,1408.373,1411.209,Next item is Cbahom17A1.,42,,
188,0.97,1411.209,1423.522,"This would add 1.6, almost $1.7 million in general fund one time funding to Hsd to help agencies that specialize in serving American Indian and native Alaskan populations.",42,,
189,0.97,1423.522,1425.991,There's two items to clarify.,42,,
190,0.97,1425.991,1435.934,"First is that the CBA describes the breakdown here with $703,000 going to rapid Rehousing services, but that's actually incorrect.",42,,
191,0.97,1435.934,1437.402,It's for a day center program.,42,,
192,0.97,1437.402,1457.756,"And I'm Remiss in not noting that we have a new homelessness count released over the summer that found that American Indians and Alaskan natives are even more DIS Proportionatety represented, at 15%, not 10%.",42,,
193,0.97,1457.756,1461.56,So I just wanted to add further context.,42,,
194,0.97,1461.56,1475.874,"In 2020, the Council made an add of approximately $1 million for two agencies that serve American Indians and Alaska natives.",42,,
195,0.97,1475.874,1490.255,"The money was provided to two organizations in 2020, the chief Seattle club.",42,,
196,0.97,1490.255,1491.69,And then the all tribes foundation.,42,,
197,0.97,1491.69,1498.663,This CBA would continue to expand above that level for more services in 2021.,42,,
198,0.97,1498.663,1503.802,Primary sponsor for this proposal is Council member Juarez.,42,,
199,0.97,1503.802,1504.502,"Thank you, Jeff.",43,,
200,0.97,1504.502,1505.203,Council member Juarez?,43,,
201,0.97,1505.203,1506.438,Thank you.,44,,
202,0.97,1506.438,1514.079,"Just a quick shout out, council member Herbold, thank you so much for the item 24 beforehand.",44,,
203,0.97,1514.079,1522.721,"I just want to say obviously a lot of organizations have been successful with the housing Connector, and I wanted to thank you for that.",44,,
204,0.97,1522.721,1527.025,"Jeff, thank you for coordinating the different pieces of this request.",44,,
205,0.97,1527.025,1532.931,"I know you'll be working to correct the description of the 700,000 from rapid Rehousing to day center.",44,,
206,0.97,1532.931,1537.802,"I know it's a technical fix, but it is important.",44,,
207,0.97,1537.802,1538.803,So thank you very much.,44,,
208,0.97,1538.803,1557.055,"This is one time funding, and as you know and we've shared with you before, our American Indian and Alaska native population is hit the hardest by homelessness.",44,,
209,0.97,1557.055,1569.768,"We makeup 10% of the homeless population, while at the same time we makeup less than 1% of the overall population of King County.",44,,
210,0.97,1569.768,1576.174,"Not a good statistic, a startling fact, but hopefully we're changing that with the programs we're funding.",44,,
211,0.97,1576.174,1588.553,"Thankfully we have Nonprofits like chief Seattle Club, who are quite frankly heroes for their successful programming to reduce homelessness and housing instability for our urban native communities and brothers and sisters.",44,,
212,0.97,1588.553,1596.895,"They truly embody what we believe in Indian country or as native people, and this is kinship.",44,,
213,0.97,1596.895,1602.901,This budget request of 1.61 will go towards the following programs as Jeff outlined briefly.,44,,
214,0.97,1602.901,1607.672,"The day center, which has been very successful.",44,,
215,0.97,1607.672,1614.512,"The homeless prevention, the outreach, the domestic violence, sexual assault, and the Reentry program which has been successful.",44,,
216,0.97,1614.512,1617.182,Thank you for your support on this budget action.,44,,
217,0.97,1617.182,1619.884,"Now, here's the good news.",44,,
218,0.97,1619.884,1640.839,"The chief Seattle club has demonstrated a consistent track record in serving the needs of our people with an 86% rate, 86% success rate of households Exiting to permanent housing and programs like rapid Rehousing, with only 3% of participants returning to homelessness.",44,,
219,0.97,1640.839,1645.443,A lot of this has to do with Moms and kids.,44,,
220,0.97,1645.443,1651.316,"So, um, I just think that's really important to note.",44,,
221,0.97,1651.316,1660.759,"We have a bunch of different types of unsheltered people in our community, but when we can get them in homes, they stay there.",44,,
222,0.97,1660.759,1669.534,The programs are targeted to Stabling indigenous and native people by creating a Pathway to permanent housing.,44,,
223,0.97,1669.534,1674.372,The chief Seattle day Club center serves as the front door to welcome in clients.,44,,
224,0.97,1674.372,1684.849,"It's where the club builds trust with members serving basic needs and stabilizing clients with on site services that would be health care, mental health, and traditional wellness.",44,,
225,0.97,1684.849,1699.364,I think Council member Morales spoke to this this morning as well about why it's important when you have Community-Based organizations on the ground and know the community and their client base with which we work with and what their needs are.,44,,
226,0.97,1699.364,1709.407,"Chief Seattle Club works with their brothers and sisters at United Indians, the Seattle Indian health board, mother nation, and other surrounding tribal governments.",44,,
227,0.97,1709.407,1716.314,"I won't list all the tribal governments, but there are six in King County out of the seven.",44,,
228,0.97,1716.314,1719.718,They do extensive outreach with them.,44,,
229,0.97,1719.718,1732.831,And also Reconnecting people with their tribes if they're part of the 29 tribes in Washington state as well as out of state.,44,,
230,0.97,1732.831,1748.913,"And, um, further more combined with prevention, outreach, and Reentry services, chief Seattle club has been shared with us, and as we have seen, as the power to change lives and make a significant difference in our city and our native population.",44,,
231,0.97,1748.913,1754.119,"And their success rate proves that their model of kinship, empathy, and grace works so.",44,,
232,0.97,1754.119,1764.162,"Very quickly I shared this earlier, I think I couple of days ago, but I wanted to share it one more time to talk about how well your investment has grown with chief Seattle club.",44,,
233,0.97,1764.162,1775.974,"In the housing pipeline we have the Eagle village Online with 24 units, we have 80 units of affordable housing, construction is underway.",44,,
234,0.97,1775.974,1787.652,We have the sacred medicine house with 600 units of permanent supportive housing permanent supportive housing will be located in district 5.,44,,
235,0.97,1787.652,1800.098,"With that, I hope some of my colleagues will join me in supporting this budget request of the successes and hopefully the continued successes of chief Seattle club.",44,,
236,0.97,1800.098,1800.398,Thank you.,44,,
237,0.97,1800.398,1806.304,Thank you very much Council member Juarez.,45,,

241,0.97,1818.416,1822.42,Let's move on to the next item.,45,,
242,0.97,1822.42,1827.025,"Next item, Hom18A1 adds $100,000 to Hsd to support the social service provider Academy.",46,,
243,0.97,1827.025,1840.305,"As we discussed last week, the the social service provider Academy is a program at the Seattle center college that support a position at Seattle value college, a navigator position.",46,,
244,0.97,1840.305,1855.353,"About $80,000 of it would support that position, and another $20,000 would be flexible supports for the students that are enrolled in the program.",46,,
245,0.97,1855.353,1859.324,Which the program serves in particular.,46,,
246,0.97,1859.324,1867.966,The primary sponsor is Council member Herbold.,46,,
247,0.97,1867.966,1869.467,"Thank you, council member Herbold?",47,,
248,0.97,1869.467,1870.935,Thank you so much.,48,,
249,0.97,1870.935,1872.937,Let's see here.,48,,
250,0.97,1872.937,1879.677,"Again, many thanks to my sponsors, Council members Sawant, Lewis, and Gonzalez.",48,,
251,0.97,1879.677,1889.754,The program will allow students to complete 24 college credits to earn housing and homelessness service provider one and two certificates.,48,,
252,0.97,1889.754,1895.093,Each certificate can be earned in one of two evening course quarters.,48,,
253,0.97,1895.093,1897.228,"Overall the program costs $330,000 a year.",48,,
254,0.97,1897.228,1909.173,"This budget request is for 100,000 to fund the navigator to disperse the direct student support, and the direct student support is also included in the funding.",48,,
255,0.97,1909.173,1917.415,This can be used for anything to support the students from paying late utility bills to child care to bus passes.,48,,
256,0.97,1917.415,1921.019,The program itself started this year in September.,48,,
257,0.97,1921.019,1925.123,I actually proposed funding for it last year.,48,,
258,0.97,1925.123,1930.495,It currently has 21 students enrolled.,48,,
259,0.97,1930.495,1940.138,"Students were recruited and referred from Plymouth housing, Catholic community services, the chief Seattle Club, Mary's place, reach, and Desc.",48,,
260,0.97,1940.138,1953.851,"The student racial identity is diverse with in the first Cohort, um, 13 being black or African American, 1 person being native American, and 7 individuals being white.",48,,
261,0.97,1953.851,1961.159,The majority of students have a lived experience of homelessness and housing instability.,48,,
262,0.97,1961.159,1971.069,"Credits from the program are transferable to Seattle community colleges, two and four year degrees.",48,,
263,0.97,1971.069,1995.193,We heard a Testifier talk about how this particular program for them as an individual with lived experience of homelessness has allowed them to move from a front line job at a homeless shelter to actually have a career in social services.,48,,
264,0.97,1995.193,1999.13,"Much like we fund apprenticeship programs for physical labor jobs, this is a lot like that.",48,,
265,0.97,1999.13,2009.24,But it's for the human infrastructure we need to support our social service Netanyahuwork here in Seattle.,48,,
266,0.97,2009.24,2010.208,Thank you.,48,,
267,0.97,2010.208,2016.013,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",49,,

269,0.97,2016.581,2017.815,I have a question.,50,,
270,0.97,2017.815,2027.625,Can you help me understand a little more about what the navigator position does?,50,,
271,0.97,2027.625,2028.426,"I could try, Yeah.",51,,
272,0.97,2028.426,2043.608,"The navigator position is, I think it's a little like a case manager, but for a case manager in a, um, in a program that's really focused on education.",51,,
273,0.97,2043.608,2058.956,"There are navigator positions that are part of the Seattle Pomise, um, program for our, and that's the piece that the city funds, or one of the pieces that the city funds for Seattle promise.",51,,
274,0.97,2058.956,2067.331,"And that is the position that, again, helps assess what the needs are of the student.",51,,
275,0.97,2067.331,2073.871,And helps them provide those needs and ensure they're met because it's really part of being able to meet these needs.,51,,
276,0.97,2073.871,2077.008,It's really part of being successful in this academic atmosphere.,51,,
277,0.97,2080.511,2082.547,Okay.,51,,
278,0.97,2082.547,2084.215,Thank you so much.,52,,

282,0.97,2098.362,2098.896,Moving on.,52,,
283,0.97,2098.896,2107.105,"Next item, the last homelessness item is Cbahom19A01.",53,,
284,0.97,2107.105,2118.282,"It adds $100,000 and a temporary pocket to Hsd for a grant and contract administration position and also imposes a proviso restricting the use of these funds for that purpose.",53,,
285,0.97,2118.282,2119.617,It's proposed by Council member Mosqueda.,53,,
286,0.97,2119.617,2120.751,Thank you very much.,54,,
287,0.97,2120.751,2134.899,You may have heard me describe this before when talking at form as and also in your conversation about the current context of what many of our front line workers within Hsd are dealing with.,54,,
288,0.97,2134.899,2138.035,There's a lot of work and not enough folks to do the work.,54,,
289,0.97,2138.035,2161.025,"As the city continues the respond to the homelessness crisis but ensuring they have contracts with community partners who have the trusted relationships, we also need to ensure that we're ensuring there's resources within the city to expedite those contracts and do it in a way that doesn't put at risk the contracts we're collectively working on to get out of the community.",54,,
290,0.97,2161.025,2179.977,This is an effort to provide the human service Department with additional capacity and also supports the human service providers who have talked about the need to help have additional support to move the contracts through.,54,,
291,0.97,2179.977,2188.085,This addition is for one vacant administrative support position and allows the funds to be used to expedite the contracts.,54,,
292,0.97,2188.085,2198.462,"And I should note that once the regional entity gets up and running, this position would Ideally be transferred to the new entity.",54,,
293,0.97,2198.462,2201.365,Wanted to make sure folks knew that as well.,54,,
294,0.97,2201.365,2202.466,Questions on that item?,54,,
295,0.97,2202.466,2204.702,"Okay, thank you very much.",54,,
296,0.97,2204.702,2208.706,"Council member Herbold, I saw you add your name as well.",54,,

300,0.97,2221.219,2222.32,Great.,54,,
301,0.97,2222.32,2227.325,So does that conclude everything in the homelessness category?,54,,
302,0.97,2227.325,2228.226,"Yes, it does.",55,,
303,0.97,2228.226,2229.76,"Okay, no additional questions.",56,,
304,0.97,2229.76,2235.299,I don't see anybody else raising their hand to add their names to other items in this category.,56,,
305,0.97,2235.299,2240.538,Want to thank you Jeff and team for walking us through that list of items in homelessness today.,56,,

315,0.97,2278.109,2295.96,"This is Council budget action 001A001 which would add 65,000 to the office of the inspector general for public safety to support its sentinel event review of the George Floyd and black lives matter demonstrations that occurred last summer.",61,,
316,0.97,2295.96,2305.169,The CBA would provide compensation for community involvement as the Oig analyzes the root conferences for the use of force in the summer demonstrations.,61,,
317,0.97,2305.169,2310.207,Funding would also support community engagement expenses related to conducting the outreach.,61,,

322,0.97,2321.118,2336.233,"As described by Greg, the office of Inspector General for public safety is undertaking a sentinel were event review to the George Floyd and black lives matter demonstrations that took place over the summer and continue through today.",63,,
323,0.97,2336.233,2362.893,"Most Notefully, the additional funds, which are small in nature, $65,000, will support Stipends and contracting fees with community members and lived experience experts who are going to advise in the Intentionive community engagement critical to the success of the sentinel event review that's currently planned by the inspector general.",63,,
324,0.97,2362.893,2374.105,The Oig expects to incur additional costs with this work that they had not budgeted for or anticipated in advance as no one knew what this year would bring to all of us.,63,,
325,0.97,2374.105,2383.647,"While the expected costs are well over $100,000, the Oig expects to cover some of the costs by Reallocating existing resources.",63,,
326,0.97,2383.647,2400.965,"This $65,000 investment would be a supplement to their budget to allow the IG to devote the resources necessary to successfully complete this critical project by making sure it's informed by community and lived experience perspectives.",63,,
327,0.97,2400.965,2401.332,"Thank you, chair.",63,,

331,0.97,2413.978,2416.514,"Thank you so much, Council President.",64,,
332,0.97,2416.514,2422.987,"In summarizing, Council members Herbold and Strauss as cosponsors.",64,,
333,0.97,2422.987,2428.225,"I believe that moves us into the SPD related category, correct, Greg?",64,,
334,0.97,2428.225,2428.526,Yes.,65,,
335,0.97,2428.526,2429.627,Wonderful.,66,,
336,0.97,2429.627,2442.139,"With the Council's permission, we are going to ask for item number 51 to be considered first among the SPD related items.",66,,
337,0.97,2442.139,2443.14,Any concern or objection?,66,,
338,0.97,2443.14,2444.442,Hearing none.,66,,
339,0.97,2444.442,2446.544,"Council member Sawant, this would be your item.",66,,
340,0.97,2446.544,2450.948,Thank you for letting us know you have an early departure today.,66,,
341,0.97,2450.948,2451.782,Let's start there --,66,,
342,0.97,2451.782,2453.918,Sorry to interrupt chair Mosqueda.,67,,
343,0.97,2453.918,2457.254,Can you tell me which CDA or slide number that would be?,67,,
344,0.97,2457.254,2457.621,Absolutely.,68,,
345,0.97,2457.621,2461.358,I don't have the ability to look through the agenda with the screens up.,69,,
346,0.97,2461.358,2462.526,Absolutely.,70,,
347,0.97,2462.526,2465.83,And I know we have an alphabet suit and hodgepodge of numbers.,70,,
348,0.97,2465.83,2471.435,Let me read it for the viewing public as well.,70,,
349,0.97,2471.435,2481.178,Item number 51 is Council member Sawant's proposal Spd-600-A-001.,70,,
350,0.97,2481.178,2489.286,It's the last item in the official slide deck for the documents submitted on time.,70,,
351,0.97,2489.286,2489.62,Excellent.,70,,
352,0.97,2489.62,2491.989,Thank you for that.,70,,
353,0.97,2491.989,2497.094,"Greg, thank you for taking this item first and we'll turn it back over to you.",70,,
354,0.97,2497.094,2509.306,"Okay, so this item would cut 2.5 million from SPD and add 2.5 million to a new community safety and communications center.",71,,
355,0.97,2509.306,2520.184,"That's the one that is in the Mayor's proposed budget, and transfer 18 community service officers from SPD to the new center.",71,,
356,0.97,2520.184,2522.219,"Thank you, council member Sawant, please go ahead.",72,,
357,0.97,2522.219,2522.82,Thank you.,73,,
358,0.97,2522.82,2537.868,First of all I want to thank both you chair Mosqueda and all Council members for allowing this item to be heard earlier.,73,,
359,0.97,2537.868,2548.345,Also Council member Herbolds and Lewis' offices that worked on this together and their related amendments coming from Council member Herbold's primary sponsorship later.,73,,
360,0.97,2548.345,2570.634,I want to let all Council members know that my staff have indicated to central staff and the chair the other amendments I won't be present for that I'm Cosponsoring so that information can be relayed during the meeting.,73,,
361,0.97,2570.634,2575.739,This moves the community service program out of the police Department and into the new public safety Department.,73,,
362,0.97,2575.739,2582.046,"Just to remind Council members, community service officers are not police officers.",73,,
363,0.97,2582.046,2584.682,They don't carry arms.,73,,
364,0.97,2584.682,2594.191,We know there are many situations where police are sent that a social worker would be far more helpful and less harmful.,73,,
365,0.97,2594.191,2631.095,"The community service officers themselves, many of them that my staff and I have talked the a number of times are dedicated members of the community who do extremely go work, however the officers have determined that operating under the command structure of the police Department has made it far more difficult to serve their communities given the principles of the different approach, and they have got organized and are requesting to be moved out of the police Department which is what this budget amendment would do.",73,,
366,0.97,2631.095,2633.864,"I think, um, we may have a few questions.",74,,
367,0.97,2633.864,2635.099,"Council member Herbold, please go ahead?",74,,
368,0.97,2635.099,2642.339,"Yeah, not a question, I just want to thank Council member Sawant for being flexible in this item.",75,,
369,0.97,2642.339,2652.65,"I think when it was originally proposed, the proposal, um, was a little different.",75,,
370,0.97,2652.65,2670.701,"I think myself and other Council members were in contact with the Csos and their Union teamsters to find out what their interests were, and they're really excited by the idea of moving to the new safety and communications center.",75,,
371,0.97,2670.701,2683.614,So thank you to Council member Sawant for being flexible on this proposal and including our input.,75,,
372,0.97,2683.614,2684.515,Other questions or comments?,76,,
373,0.97,2684.515,2694.091,"All right, Councilmen Sawant, thank Council member Sawant, thank you for walking that through it.",77,,
374,0.97,2694.091,2701.799,"We understand if you have to drop off, and I know you and your team will continue watching off line.",77,,
375,0.97,2701.799,2704.702,Thanks for sharing the other amendments you're Cosponsoring as well.,77,,
376,0.97,2704.702,2705.869,We'll be sure to note those.,77,,
377,0.97,2705.869,2719.917,"Greg, I'll turn it back over to you, and we'll go back to the top, I believe we're on Spd001A001.",77,,
378,0.97,2719.917,2720.384,That's correct.,78,,
379,0.97,2720.384,2724.521,We have about 16 of these to get through this afternoon.,78,,
380,0.97,2724.521,2729.326,"The first several will be slides, and then we'll move into budget actions.",78,,
381,0.97,2729.326,2743.24,The first one you just gave the number for would request the Seattle police Department provide the reports included and requested in ordinance 126148 and resolution 31962.,78,,
382,0.97,2743.24,2749.313,That's the ordinance and resolution that the council passed last summer.,78,,
383,0.97,2749.313,2772.102,"The reports include financial and compensation reports basically every two weeks starting on January 1st, and then a one-time report on potential Civilianizations of the sworn functions in SPD, a report on the impact of the reductions made in the summer budget, ordinance 126148, and to report on methods for providing incentives for early retirement.",78,,
384,0.97,2772.102,2783.947,All those three one-time reports would also be due on January 1ST.,78,,
385,0.97,2783.947,2786.717,This one is sponsored primarily by Council member Herbold.,78,,
386,0.97,2786.717,2787.618,Thank you very much.,79,,
387,0.97,2787.618,2790.087,Council member Herbold.,79,,
388,0.97,2790.087,2797.995,"& GT; . Yes, again, this picks up off of the many reports we requested during the summer budget process.",80,,
389,0.97,2797.995,2811.708,The form B was submitted as the reports requested by the Council in ordinance 126148 and resolution 31962 have not yet been received.,80,,
390,0.97,2811.708,2822.219,These are reports that we were intending to have for purposes of making budget decisions for 2021.,80,,
391,0.97,2822.219,2834.665,Earlier the Seattle city budget office responded to a Council question about the status of these reports indicating that some of these items will receive responses or initial responses next week.,80,,
392,0.97,2834.665,2844.041,So the scope may be adjusted depending on those replies.,80,,
393,0.97,2844.041,2849.746,"Per the Civilianization report, um, the reply we've received refers to the Idt and community safety work group, but doesn't list the date.",80,,
394,0.97,2849.746,2881.578,"I could give more details about each of the four reports if desired, but I think for purposes of saving our time, I would say I'd like to work with the sponsors in updating the language in the slide to reflect what we know from CBO about which reports we'll receive in the next couple of weeks and which will still be outstanding.",80,,
395,0.97,2881.578,2887.551,"And Council member Herbold, are you able to have side that update in the next few days here?",81,,
396,0.97,2887.551,2892.789,"Absolutely, I have the information as does I believe Greg now.",82,,
397,0.97,2892.789,2900.764,So we'll have use the information that we have to modify the the request.,82,,
398,0.97,2900.764,2901.164,Excellent.,83,,
399,0.97,2901.164,2902.699,Thank you for that update.,83,,
400,0.97,2902.699,2914.111,"I see all the other Council members signed on to this, so no questions at this point.",83,,
401,0.97,2914.111,2927.324,"You're changed by Sawant, Pederson, Juarez, Morales, Strauss, and Council President Gonzalez.",83,,
402,0.97,2927.324,2931.895,"Next slide is A001, which requires a monthly report on Useover overtime.",84,,
403,0.97,2931.895,2937.434,"This particularly slide requests a lot of data, so I'm just going to summarize it.",84,,
404,0.97,2937.434,2951.615,"I would say that the reporting requirements Reinstitute the overtime reports that central staff had been Receivig monthly over the past few years, but have fallen off to a more periodic basis.",84,,
405,0.97,2951.615,2961.725,Te slide would request a number of reports designed to ensure the Department is implementing the recommendations on overtime reform.,84,,
406,0.97,2961.725,2969.466,"With that as a high level summary, council member Herbold sponsored it, and I'll leave it to here if she'd like to provide more detail.",84,,
407,0.97,2969.466,2970.334,Council member Herbold?,85,,
408,0.97,2970.334,2978.742,Just looking at my notes to see what Greg didn't cover.,86,,
409,0.97,2978.742,2985.983,We know overtime spending in SPD has been of high into to the Council and community generally.,86,,
410,0.97,2985.983,2993.29,My office asked the city auditor for recommendations on reporting.,86,,
411,0.97,2993.29,3006.336,Their recommendations are contained here in the statement of legislative intent.,86,,
412,0.97,3006.336,3013.61,"Spd implemented some of the recommendations, seven of the recommendations haven't yet been implemented.",86,,
413,0.97,3013.61,3031.928,"Some relate Specificaly to a Tech solution, but there are a number of things that while we're waiting for the Tech solution to be delivered, that SPD could be doing and may be doing to track overtime to make sure, not just overtime, sorry.",86,,
414,0.97,3031.928,3034.097,The issue is broader than overtime.,86,,
415,0.97,3034.097,3035.632,It's overtime and off duty work.,86,,
416,0.97,3035.632,3040.637,It's really important that our officers are not working more hours than they're allowed to work.,86,,
417,0.97,3040.637,3042.639,Thank you.,86,,
418,0.97,3045.075,3051.848,Thank you very much Council member Herbold.,87,,
419,0.97,3051.848,3052.449,Questions or comments.,87,,
420,0.97,3052.449,3053.917,I have one.,88,,
421,0.97,3053.917,3060.924,Go ahead Council President.,89,,
422,0.97,3060.924,3078.141,"I wanted to say thank you to Council member Herbold for resurrecting this particular action after we had gotten the report, I think it was in 2016, related to the overtime usage issues from the city auditor.",90,,
423,0.97,3078.141,3105.101,"I had originally passed a resolution requiring these overtime reports to be provided to the city Council, which, um, if my recollection serves me, hadn't been done regularly in the past, so I think this is a good opportunity to continue Memorializing that muscle memory around requiring this level of transparency, and these reports certainly accomplishment that.",90,,
424,0.97,3105.101,3112.108,It will give us a heads up as soon as possible related to the trends.,90,,
425,0.97,3112.108,3120.083,So really appreciate Council member Herbold continuing this effort to make sure we continue to get this information.,90,,
426,0.97,3121.418,3130.093,Thank you very much Council President Gonzalez and Council member Herbold.,91,,
427,0.97,3130.093,3135.265,"I see Strauss, Lewis, and Pederson adding their names as well.",91,,
428,0.97,3135.265,3142.639,We have Council members Morales and Sawant also listed along with the Council President.,91,,
429,0.97,3142.639,3146.743,"So thank you very much, everybody.",91,,
430,0.97,3146.743,3149.513,On to the next Sli.,91,,
431,0.97,3149.513,3152.849,Spd003A001 continues on the same theme.,92,,
432,0.97,3152.849,3166.763,"It would require the police Department to provide monthly staffing reports that were submitted over the last few years, and most recently requested in SPD Sli13A2 from 2020.",92,,
433,0.97,3166.763,3184.247,"I would say these Reinstitute the reports that central staff regularly gets, but they are now going to add under this Sli some reporting requirements on demographic data on hires and separations, and these would be provided monthly.",92,,
434,0.97,3184.247,3186.182,This is brought by Council member Herbold.,92,,
435,0.97,3186.182,3189.653,"Excellent, please go ahead Council member Herbold.",93,,
436,0.97,3189.653,3191.454,Thank you.,94,,
437,0.97,3191.454,3201.798,"This is again something, a reporting cadence that Council President Gonzalez started when she was the public safety chair.",94,,
438,0.97,3201.798,3219.583,It's been in practice two years up until the beginning of this year the additional information we're asking in the staffing report is to include demographic data regarding hires and separations.,94,,
439,0.97,3219.583,3239.336,"Because of the interest that the Council has in the diversity of new hires and the concern about out of order lay offs necessarily Impacting those new hires, um, and just want to again state for the record that we did receive two of the regularly scheduled monthly reports this year.",94,,
440,0.97,3239.336,3243.139,I received a third when the Council requested it over the summer.,94,,
441,0.97,3243.139,3253.95,I'd like to get back to a more regular reporting schedule and this item allows us to do so.,94,,
442,0.97,3253.95,3254.251,Thank you.,94,,
443,0.97,3254.251,3258.054,"Thank you very much, council member Herbold.",95,,
444,0.97,3258.054,3260.156,Any questions or leagues?,95,,
445,0.97,3260.156,3261.925,Council President Gonzalez.,95,,
446,0.97,3261.925,3273.87,"Yes, just really quickly, can either Council member Herbold or Greg remind me if, um, the, if this particular Sli gets down to the granular level of precinct?",96,,
447,0.97,3273.87,3280.143,I know the original staffing report that I had requested from SPD didn't get to that level.,96,,
448,0.97,3280.143,3281.444,And then we asked them to modify that.,96,,
449,0.97,3281.444,3291.388,"I want to remember if we're getting to the granular level of Precinct, watch, et cetera.",96,,
450,0.97,3291.388,3305.168,"Council member, it goes down to the level of Precinct, and goes down to the level of the various kinds of patrol resources put out there.",97,,
451,0.97,3305.168,3310.707,"It doesn't go to watch, but that's the only thing missing.",97,,
452,0.97,3310.707,3311.808,We'd have to add that.,97,,
453,0.97,3311.808,3339.736,"And Council member Herbold, it may not be useful to have the staffing as it relates to watch, first watch, second watch, third watch, the shifts, but I would just sort of put that out there if you and your Afollow analysis and consultation with central staff think that would be additional helpful information to ask SPD to report.",98,,
454,0.97,3339.736,3345.442,I'd offer that as a suggestion to consider.,98,,
455,0.97,3345.442,3346.142,Thank you.,99,,
456,0.97,3346.142,3349.045,I'm not seeing any additional questions.,100,,
457,0.97,3349.045,3353.983,"Council member Herbold is joined by Council members Juarez, Gonzalez, and Pederson, Strauss, and Lewis.",100,,
458,0.97,3357.554,3359.422,Thank you very much.,100,,
459,0.97,3359.422,3361.825,Let's go to the next one.,100,,
460,0.97,3361.825,3365.428,The next one is Spd004A001.,101,,
461,0.97,3365.428,3388.885,"This is a statement of legislative intent that would require the Department to provide on March 31 a report on the demographics collected for traffic stops, and that would include stops made for criminal and Non-Criminal purposes, and it would also specify racial disparities as requested in ordinance 125358.",101,,
462,0.97,3388.885,3406.936,"This also requests that SPD provide a separate and additional report on September 1ST that made recommendations on training and policy changes consistent with the consent decree, consistent with the first report, and to address bias and racial disparities found in the data.",101,,
463,0.97,3406.936,3411.107,And so this was brought to you by Council member Herbold.,101,,
464,0.97,3411.107,3411.708,Thank you.,102,,
465,0.97,3411.708,3413.476,Council member Herbold?,102,,
466,0.97,3413.476,3416.479,Thank you so much.,103,,
467,0.97,3416.479,3437.801,"This item was actually brought to my attention after, um, after some reporting done on the, on a consulting contract that looked at the impact of fees and fines on community, low income people in communities of color.",103,,
468,0.97,3437.801,3442.005,This is a report given to my committee by Dr. Alexis Harris.,103,,
469,0.97,3442.005,3465.261,"And the report showed that a lot of great work is being done by our courts in reducing fees and fines to the lowest levels permitted, a very large number of cases.",103,,
470,0.97,3465.261,3484.28,"But the report found that there are practices in the police Department that still need to be changed in order to, um, to address what continues to be racial disparity in, in policing.",103,,
471,0.97,3484.28,3506.503,"And, so invest some reporting done on this report in my Committee, and the reporter made note that the data wasn't being reported by SPD on the demographic, the graphic information wasn't being reported on these traffic stops.",103,,
472,0.97,3506.503,3520.884,And that really surprised me because I remembered that we had passed ordinance 125358 that required that this information be reported.,103,,
473,0.97,3520.884,3540.703,"So thanks to folks working hard in our press core and identifying, um, if importance of transparency in this area in order to work with our Department to come up with better policies that continue to address these disparities.",103,,
474,0.97,3540.703,3547.844,So really happy to move this forward.,103,,
475,0.97,3547.844,3552.148,"Excellent, thank you very much.",104,,
476,0.97,3552.148,3555.218,I see all the others signing on.,104,,
477,0.97,3555.218,3558.054,"Sawant, Pederson, Juarez, Strauss, Morales, and Gonzalez.",104,,
478,0.97,3558.054,3558.821,Not seeing additional questions.,104,,
479,0.97,3558.821,3562.759,Next Sli.,104,,
480,0.97,3562.759,3566.262,"All right, the next one is Spd005A001.",105,,
481,0.97,3566.262,3585.081,This is a statement of legislative intent that would require SPD provide a report that analyzes the costs of using parking enforcement officers and other Non-Spd officers to be the sole enforcement of traffic control during special events or contracted sports events.,105,,
482,0.97,3585.081,3587.483,"It would be due on March 30th, 2021.",105,,
483,0.97,3587.483,3607.003,"Just by way of background, right now it's a mix of sworn officers providing traffic control and Peos providing some traffic direction, and this particular Sli would look at the actual savings provided if all that work were Transitioned to Peos.",105,,
484,0.97,3607.003,3611.474,And it's brought to you by Council member Pederson.,105,,
485,0.97,3611.474,3613.076,Hello Council member Pederson.,106,,
486,0.97,3613.076,3614.11,Please go ahead.,106,,
487,0.97,3614.11,3618.915,Thank you chair Mosqueda and Greg for that explanation.,107,,
488,0.97,3618.915,3627.523,We're just looking for more cost effective ways to deliver the same or better safety and services to the people of Seattle.,107,,
489,0.97,3627.523,3635.198,This includes having unarmed less expensive professionals enforcing certain laws like parking and traffic during big sporting events.,107,,
490,0.97,3635.198,3645.408,"Rather than paying the high cost, Pensive overtime for fully equipped highly qualified police officers, let's save money by deploying other professionals to do the same job.",107,,
491,0.97,3645.408,3649.912,Then we can redeploy the savings to other community needs.,107,,
492,0.97,3649.912,3653.116,This Sli helps us to quantify those savings.,107,,
493,0.97,3653.116,3653.516,Thank you.,107,,
494,0.97,3653.516,3658.955,Thank you Council member Pederson.,108,,
495,0.97,3658.955,3659.956,Any questions or comments?,108,,
496,0.97,3659.956,3660.857,I have a quick question.,108,,
497,0.97,3660.857,3664.027,Perhaps this is for Greg as well.,108,,
498,0.97,3664.027,3668.831,Maybe this is a situation where good minds are thinking the exact same thing.,108,,
499,0.97,3668.831,3671.467,I don't know the saying right now.,108,,
500,0.97,3671.467,3672.935,Great minds think alike.,108,,
501,0.97,3672.935,3688.184,"Is this a component of what we saw in item number 30, Spd002A001 sub 5.",108,,
502,0.97,3688.184,3690.586,A list of special events?,108,,
503,0.97,3690.586,3691.387,Is this different?,108,,
504,0.97,3691.387,3703.766,"Yeah, I think the reference that you're making, Madam chair, is more of an administrative or accounting check.",109,,
505,0.97,3703.766,3712.108,"When personnel from SPD perform overtime work whether it's a PEO or police officer, they fill out paper forms that record their hours.",109,,
506,0.97,3712.108,3724.454,"Sometimes they put their hours into a time keeping system Online, and the item you read is about reconciling those things to ensure no one is paid twice.",109,,
507,0.97,3724.454,3730.026,So a little different than what Council member Pederson is proposing here.,109,,
508,0.97,3730.026,3744.64,"Okay, thank you, anything else to add Council member Pederson?",110,,
509,0.97,3744.64,3745.475,"Okay, thank you.",110,,
510,0.97,3745.475,3750.546,Could Council members Strauss and Lewis are cosponsors.,110,,
511,0.97,3750.546,3764.06,Now we're an the Sli that requests the Department provide quarterly reports that identify the response time impacts on SPD's ability to answer 911 calls.,111,,
512,0.97,3764.06,3779.142,Specifically the effect of patrician of police officers in the 2020 period and changes made around the deployment of officers.,111,,
513,0.97,3779.142,3790.987,"You'll recall in the last couple of months, chief Diaz moved some into patrol to maintain better 911 response times.",111,,
514,0.97,3790.987,3810.106,The Sli would ask for reports that measure that and also ask for reports that measure patrician of police officers and bear that effect on 911 response times and any other additions made to the proposed staffing plan.,111,,
515,0.97,3810.106,3819.715,And finally changes that are made in the deployment of officers to patrol similar to the ones made this year.,111,,
516,0.97,3819.715,3822.285,The report would be due on January 1ST of 2020.,111,,
517,0.97,3822.285,3825.555,And it's brought to you by Council member Pederson again.,111,,
518,0.97,3825.555,3826.522,Thank you.,112,,
519,0.97,3826.522,3827.723,Council member Pederson t please go ahead.,112,,
520,0.97,3827.723,3832.595,"Thank you chair Mosqueda, thank you, Greg, and thanks to the cosponsors as well.",113,,
521,0.97,3832.595,3837.533,"Council members Herbold, Juarez, and thank you Council member Lewis for signing on.",113,,
522,0.97,3837.533,3845.641,"This report is consistent with information we've asked for previously, and to make sure we get it in 2021.",113,,
523,0.97,3845.641,3848.911,"You know, there's a lot of moving pieces here.",113,,
524,0.97,3848.911,3857.954,There are 20 different proposals to amend the Mayor's budget regarding the Seattle M.D.,113,,
525,0.97,3857.954,3858.654,Seattle police Department.,113,,
526,0.97,3858.654,3863.926,I know a lot of people want to keep track of these important Metrics.,113,,
527,0.97,3863.926,3883.045,"We had a lot of people calling in during public comment to get this information to make sure as we make changes, see staffing changes happening with attrition or whatever other policy changes we make, we're getting consistent reporting on 911 response times.",113,,
528,0.97,3883.045,3887.783,And this is narrowed down just to the priority one calls.,113,,
529,0.97,3887.783,3888.885,Thank you.,113,,
530,0.97,3888.885,3892.021,Thank you very much Council member Pederson.,114,,
531,0.97,3892.021,3894.19,Any other questions or comments?,114,,
532,0.97,3894.19,3895.324,Council member Herbold and then Council member Lewis.,114,,
533,0.97,3895.324,3897.893,Thank you so much.,115,,
534,0.97,3897.893,3915.911,"I think as we are, um, being asked to, um, replace 911 response with other crisis response outside of SPD, having this information will be critically important to guiding our efforts.",115,,
535,0.97,3915.911,3920.116,So I appreciate Council member Pederson bringing this forward.,115,,
536,0.97,3920.116,3934.997,"I do also want to mention, sorry, I intended to indicate my entire to sponsor the previous report yes, thank you, on using Peos for special events.",115,,
537,0.97,3934.997,3945.374,"This is another body of work that this Council will be doing a lot of work on in the upcoming year, and this information would be helpful as well.",115,,
538,0.97,3945.374,3951.047,"Thank you, and thanks to Patty for capturing that additional Cosponsorship.",116,,
539,0.97,3951.047,3952.148,Council member Lewis?,116,,
540,0.97,3952.148,3956.352,"Yes, and thank you Council member Pederson for bringing this forward.",117,,
541,0.97,3956.352,3957.887,I'm happy to cosponsor this.,117,,
542,0.97,3957.887,3996.258,"I did want to ask, I don't know if it's a good question for you or Greg, but as far as the scope of measuring the impact on 911 response times whether the report would include the impact of the expanded duties assuming the Council is successful and the bargaining is successful on expanding the duties of the parking enforcement officers that called in this morning and were well represented in public comment.",117,,
543,0.97,3996.258,3998.294,It was great to hear them.,117,,
544,0.97,3998.294,4010.206,But a number of the duties enumerated from their Union in the letter to us included things that could be the response to a 911 call.,117,,
545,0.97,4010.206,4015.711,"Some examples would be, um, you know, doing an in person report of a vehicle prowl or minor theft.",117,,
546,0.97,4015.711,4019.849,"Maybe a low priority 911 call, but could be a response.",117,,
547,0.97,4019.849,4024.086,Or a minor collision are some of the things that just stand out to me.,117,,
548,0.97,4024.086,4031.527,"Could be a, a 911 call where they could be the first people on the scene.",117,,
549,0.97,4031.527,4044.306,"And I wonder if it's currently envisioned that examining, um, that role would be something that would be in the scope to be considered in assessing the overall impact.",117,,
550,0.97,4044.306,4060.056,"If it isn't yet, if the sponsor and central staff think it could be included as one of the factors that's assessed as that workload, as some of the 911 response workload could go to the Peos in a significant way.",117,,
551,0.97,4060.056,4061.29,Thank you Council member Lewis.,118,,
552,0.97,4061.29,4062.858,I'll try and answer that.,118,,
553,0.97,4062.858,4090.853,I want to be sensitive to concerns raised earlier during issue identification that response times may not be the best metric when we're dealing with lower priority calls to just focus in on response times for priority one calls.,118,,
554,0.97,4090.853,4101.897,"That said, it's probably something we could request, especially if you're changing the roles of certain professionals providing services to just have the Metrics and measure them.",118,,
555,0.97,4101.897,4120.182,"But on this particular item, it was just, I was being sensitive to other concerns sort of on the, from a different angle, like do we really want to focus on response times for like a fender Bender, for example.",118,,
556,0.97,4120.182,4137.967,"Well, to clarify, sorry, maybe I, um, sorry if you misunderstood, but I was more getting at the impact it could have to the benefit of 911 response times for priority one calls if some of the case load is being redirected.",119,,
557,0.97,4137.967,4149.945,"So we wouldn't be expected to respond to the priority calls anymore, and if that has a positive impact freeing up capacity for patrol to respond to the calls.",119,,
558,0.97,4149.945,4157.853,"Yes, I think the scope of this should be providing reasons why things have changed and gotten better or worse.",120,,
559,0.97,4157.853,4179.175,"If they've gotten better, that could be a reason that should be noted by this, within this scope, that should be noted that this is why the change was made.",120,,
560,0.97,4179.175,4185.08,Thank you Council member Pederson and Council member Lewis.,121,,
561,0.97,4185.08,4185.447,Great question.,121,,
562,0.97,4185.447,4186.615,Any additional questions or comments?,121,,
563,0.97,4186.615,4188.584,"Okay, I'm not seeing any.",121,,
564,0.97,4188.584,4192.788,"So we currently get reports on attrition, we currently get reports on response time.",121,,
565,0.97,4192.788,4210.673,"This is really forward looking though in terms of how those, um, response times have potentially changed or how attrition has changed and also looking at whether or not there's a cause and effect.",121,,
566,0.97,4210.673,4211.073,Is that accurate?,121,,
567,0.97,4211.073,4211.307,Yes.,122,,
568,0.97,4211.307,4216.111,Okay.,123,,
569,0.97,4216.111,4216.545,Thank you so much.,123,,
570,0.97,4216.545,4222.151,"I see Council members Herbold, Juarez, Lewis, and president Gonzalez signed onto this item.",123,,
571,0.97,4222.151,4224.053,Thank you Council member Pederson.,123,,
572,0.97,4224.053,4234.296,"I think that sums up our first few Slis here, and we're on to other items that are Council budget actions.",123,,
573,0.97,4234.296,4251.146,"I'm going to ask, um, for the committee's willingness to work with me here, and I'd like to with the agreement of the Council members who are sponsoring these items, I believe we'd like to do item 36 before item 35 if I understand that correctly.",123,,
574,0.97,4251.146,4251.347,Okay.,123,,
575,0.97,4251.347,4258.854,"Thank you, Greg.",123,,
576,0.97,4258.854,4263.359,We would like to look at SPD 009A001 first.,123,,
577,0.97,4263.359,4267.196,That's just the next slide.,123,,
578,0.97,4267.196,4268.764,"Oh, er perfect, we got it.",123,,
579,0.97,4268.764,4274.937,Thanks for your willingness to switch these around for the order of discussion here today.,123,,
580,0.97,4274.937,4276.872,"Go ahead, Greg.",123,,
581,0.97,4276.872,4287.349,"All right, so, um, this Council budget action would cut 6.1 million in salary savings for 43 positions that the Department will not be able to fill in 2021.",124,,
582,0.97,4287.349,4310.606,The funding would be transferred to finance general and the CBA would impose a proviso that would dedicate the funds to support community regulations identified by a par budget process.,124,,
583,0.97,4310.606,4347.643,"Due to higher than normal attrition that I think you're all aware of and I talked about in my other presentations, SPD staffing plan projects the Department cannot fill above 1357 FTE in 2021, so difference between what they're funded for, 1500, nd what they can fill, 1357, is the difference that's being, um, cut here and moved to finance general for participating budgeting.",124,,
584,0.97,4347.643,4350.646,It's brought to you by Council member Gonzalez.,124,,
585,0.97,4350.646,4351.647,I'll turn it over to her.,124,,
586,0.97,4351.647,4353.349,Thank you.,125,,
587,0.97,4353.349,4359.655,"Thank you so much, Greg, for that description and for your ongoing work in this area.",126,,
588,0.97,4359.655,4385.481,"So colleagues, for those of you new to the Council, just for context here, every year the police Department provides us with an estimate on their staffing forecasting model, what they think they'll be able to hire the next year, and then budget according to whatever that staffing model provides them.",126,,
589,0.97,4385.481,4403.565,"Since Greg has joined us on city Council, he's done a very good job of evaluating the projections made by the police Department and the executive as it relates to the staffing model.",126,,
590,0.97,4403.565,4418.38,"And just about every year that we've done this exercise since Greg has been here, we've actually ended up reducing the number of, um, projected sworn officer positions that SPD has forecasted that they'd be able to hire.",126,,
591,0.97,4418.38,4445.541,"And I would say every year, um, we have learned that, um, the number we right sized it to is still too big, therefore leading to an eventual Underspend by the police Department that then is used either by the Department or by the Mayor for other priorities unrelated to, many times unrelated to higher additional sworn officers.",126,,
592,0.97,4445.541,4497.059,"So really this is a, um, I would say a three or four Yearlong tradition that I have carried through in the Council's process to ensure we're being critical of the staffing model and to be fair to the executive, the staffing model projections they send down with their budget are inherently impacted by the updates in the number of Attritions they get after they transmit the budget, um, and in just additional data points that come to us that better, that sort of give us better data to put into the staffing model to produce a more realistic number of sworn officer s that SPD will be able to hire.",126,,
593,0.97,4497.059,4499.328,So they budgeted for more positions by the staffing model.,126,,
594,0.97,4499.328,4505.634,I think that's really important for colleagues to understand.,126,,
595,0.97,4505.634,4514.71,The proposed budget funds 43 more sworn officer positions than what SPD's own updated staffing model forecasts as possible.,126,,
596,0.97,4514.71,4528.39,"So history has shown us that this model often overestimates the reality of SPD's ability to fill the current, vacant, and funded positions.",126,,
597,0.97,4528.39,4541.57,"So these vacancies result, these 43 vacancies I'm targeting here result in roughly about $6.1 million in anticipated savings if this proposal is adopted by the chair.",126,,
598,0.97,4541.57,4553.849,And this Council budget action proposes to cut those funds from SPD's budget and redirect them to implement the recommendations stemming from the budget process.,126,,
599,0.97,4553.849,4562.357,So the goal is taking the $6.,126,,
600,0.97,4562.357,4584.079,"1 million that we know are savings because it's reasonable to believe SPD won't be able to hire in 2021 43 officers based on the trend of information we're seeing currently, and to capture those $6.1 million and funnel them into Council's already funded budget process.",126,,
601,0.97,4584.079,4607.135,"So this proposal is responsive to the calls from the Bipoc community members to reinvest in true community safety solutions that have broad support of community and ensure the true safety and well being of all community members, while also being careful about not eliminating positions currently full.",126,,
602,0.97,4607.135,4611.106,"These 43 positions, just to be clear, are currently vacant.",126,,
603,0.97,4611.106,4638.567,"They're funded, and based on Greg's good analysis, we've come to the determination that these 43 positions will not realistically be filled by SPD given the data trends and information currently available to us, which indicate that they will, um, be able to potentially hire some in 21, but certainly nowhere near what they have projected.",126,,
604,0.97,4638.567,4654.149,"So this is capturing the savings now on the front end for purposes of the Council's priorities to fund additional, to allocate additional funding to the budgeting process, and I'd request support from my colleagues.",126,,
605,0.97,4654.149,4655.751,Thank you.,126,,
606,0.97,4655.751,4667.562,"And I want to thank my original sponsors who the screen has populated at this point, so I lost track of who it was, but I believe it was Council members Herbold and Lewis, I think.",126,,
607,0.97,4667.562,4669.097,Or maybe Morales.,126,,
608,0.97,4669.097,4671.066,"I can't remember, I'm so sorry.",126,,
609,0.97,4671.066,4675.47,"So much support, it's hard to know.",127,,
610,0.97,4675.47,4679.608,"It was Council members Herbold and Morales, yes.",127,,
611,0.97,4679.608,4684.279,Thank you very much Council President.,127,,
612,0.97,4684.279,4685.781,Any additional comments or questions?,127,,
613,0.97,4685.781,4691.953,I'm not seeing any additional comments or questions.,127,,
614,0.97,4691.953,4698.393,"Again, we're on item number and will go back to 35 for the viewing public.",127,,
615,0.97,4698.393,4708.837,"On this item, oops, sorry, let me quickly summarize the last one.",127,,
616,0.97,4708.837,4710.305,One more.,127,,

619,0.97,4716.812,4717.612,My apologies.,129,,
620,0.97,4717.612,4720.015,I know it's challenging when we're skipping around.,129,,
621,0.97,4720.015,4720.716,Appreciate it.,129,,
622,0.97,4720.716,4722.584,Thank you so much.,129,,
623,0.97,4722.584,4732.694,"Council President Gonzalez is joined by Council members Herbold, Morales, Sawant, Juarez, Strauss, and Lewis.",129,,
624,0.97,4732.694,4739.935,"Now we're going back to item number 35, Spd088A001.",129,,
625,0.97,4739.935,4740.635,Excellent.,129,,
626,0.97,4740.635,4741.603,"Thank you so much, Patty.",129,,
627,0.97,4741.603,4743.038,"Please go ahead, Greg.",129,,
628,0.97,4743.038,4760.255,"All right, so this Council budget action would impose a proviso that would restrict SPD from spending 2.5 million and would request that SPD complete 35 officer lay offs by July 1ST of 2021.",130,,
629,0.97,4760.255,4775.237,The lay offs must be made in accordance with the out of order lay off provisions of the civil service Commission rule 15B and must follow the guidelines and principles established in Council's resolution 31962.,130,,
630,0.97,4775.237,4785.347,The lay offs may not be made in any other manner.,130,,
631,0.97,4785.347,4791.153,"This CBA has relatively complex technical adjustments, so I'll summarize it at a high level.",130,,
632,0.97,4791.153,4797.759,Last summer we passed 126148 which intended to reduce the size of SPD's sworn force by 100 officers.,130,,
633,0.97,4797.759,4813.775,"The 100 officer reduction was made through a combination of both lay offs and an assumption that attrition would be higher than SPD was projecting, consistent with the comments from Council member Gonzalez just a couple minutes or seconds ago.",130,,
634,0.97,4813.775,4826.855,"Breaking it out in the summer budget, there were supposed to be about 70 lay offs and an assumption that there would be about 30 unplanned separations, and that added up to the 100 officer reductions.",130,,
635,0.97,4826.855,4842.337,"I think as the Council knows, the lay offs did not occur due to collective bargaining issues, and I'll address the attrition momentarily a little further.",130,,
636,0.97,4842.337,4852.614,"As the Council is aware, the ordinance expires at the end of this year, and this CBA would continue in 2021, a 100 officer reduction.",130,,
637,0.97,4852.614,4859.988,"This reduction would again be made by attrition and lay offs, but this time around the mix of lay offs and attrition would change.",130,,
638,0.97,4859.988,4881.643,"Because the Department has had so much attrition lately and so many unplanned separations lately, it's now necessary to lay off only 35 officers to reach the same targeted reduction level of 100 officers, and have the same effect that the Council was intending to effect or intending to have last summer.",130,,
639,0.97,4881.643,4891.519,"Lake the summer budget changes, the money for the lay offs is not cut from the Department budget, but rather restricted by Provisos so the SPD can't access the funding.",130,,
640,0.97,4891.519,4898.693,"The action assumes the lay off of 35 officers, as I said, would occur on July 1ST.",130,,
641,0.97,4898.693,4907.202,"For this reason, the $2.5 million proviso represents about a half a year's worth of salary for the officers.",130,,
642,0.97,4907.202,4915.343,"If the lay offs do not occur, we have the option to release the proviso and restore funding to the Department.",130,,
643,0.97,4915.343,4922.083,The July 1ST lay off assumption is a relatively optimistic projection.,130,,
644,0.97,4922.083,4931.493,"In all likelihood, the lay offs would take more than a year to implement due to collective bargaining.",130,,
645,0.97,4931.493,4932.827,Particularly around decision bargaining.,130,,
646,0.97,4932.827,4942.203,"And if the lay offs don't occur, the Council would need to release the proviso so SPD has the ability to pay the 35 officers.",130,,
647,0.97,4942.203,4958.053,"This is brought to you by Council member Herbold and I can either talk about rule 15B or if you'd like to, I know that's something you're well versed in, so I defer to you.",130,,
648,0.97,4958.053,4986.981,"Perhaps I should have coordinated with you on my speaking points before today, but just big picture, this budget action combined with the budget action we just heard from Council President Gonzalez, those two actions taken together will basically continue the commitment the Council made during the summer 2020 supplemental budget.",131,,
649,0.97,4986.981,4994.756,"So, again, high level what the numbers are.",131,,
650,0.97,4994.756,5011.006,"The Mayor's proposed, um, budget during the, um, in the summer, um, included funding for 1,422 officers.",131,,
651,0.97,5011.006,5019.114,"The Council's action reduced that number to 1,322.",131,,
652,0.97,5019.114,5031.926,"If we only acted on Council President Gonzalez's action, the reduction would be from 1,422 to 1,357.",131,,
653,0.97,5031.926,5043.938,"So in order to Replicate the action taken over the summer, we need an additional 35 lay offs.",131,,
654,0.97,5043.938,5062.757,"Again, the savings realized through this effort would be used for participating budgeting, and the rule relates specifically to our efforts to pursue out of order lay offs.",131,,
655,0.97,5062.757,5068.129,"As of the summer, we were looking at out of order lay offs for 70 officers.",131,,
656,0.97,5068.129,5075.87,Now we'd only be seeking out of order lay offs for 35 officers.,131,,
657,0.97,5075.87,5095.79,My interest continues to be on focusing on those officers who can't complete their duties as a police officers due to their presence on the Brady list.,131,,
658,0.97,5095.79,5118.246,But we are looking within the city council's select labor committee and on talking about how we'll promote efforts to pursue out of order lay offs with the executive as well on what our strategies is to move those forward.,131,,
659,0.97,5118.246,5118.947,Thank you.,131,,
660,0.97,5118.947,5120.882,Thank you very much.,132,,
661,0.97,5120.882,5132.227,"Thank you, as well for helping us understand the sequencing of how it fits with the item just discussed.",132,,
662,0.97,5132.227,5134.829,Any additional questions on comments on this?,132,,
663,0.97,5134.829,5139.1,Seeing no additional questions or comments.,132,,
664,0.97,5139.1,5150.712,"I do want to appreciate that we have everybody that put their hand up so far on the screen, so thank you very much Council members signing on as cosponsors.",132,,
665,0.97,5150.712,5158.453,"It includes Morales, Sawant, Strauss, and Council President Gonzalez.",132,,
666,0.97,5158.453,5165.059,Let's go to the next one.,132,,
667,0.97,5165.059,5181.809,"The next one is Spd010A001, and this particular action would cut 3.7 million from the Seattle police Department's overtime funding that's potentially unnecessary N2021 due to Covid related changes and service demands.",133,,
668,0.97,5181.809,5195.156,"This would add the 3.7 million to finance general and impose a proviso that would, again, dedicate the funds to support comment recommendations identified through the budget process.",133,,
669,0.97,5195.156,5207.435,"By way of background, the cut would reduce SPD's 2021 overtime budget from 24.9 million down to 21.2 million.",133,,
670,0.97,5207.435,5220.615,And that 21.2 million is the exact same level that SPD is budgeted at this year after they made the Covid related reductions last summer.,133,,
671,0.97,5220.615,5234.095,"So you'll recall that SPD and the Mayor's office reduced their overtime budget because they had less demands around special events, traffic control, things like that.",133,,
672,0.97,5234.095,5260.054,"They reduced the budget to 20.2 million, and this budget action would then reduce it to 21.2 million with the Asung that there would not be the same, that the lack of demand for Emand for service would continue.",133,,
673,0.97,5260.054,5261.289,That's brought by Council member Herbold.,133,,
674,0.97,5261.289,5262.423,Go ahead.,134,,
675,0.97,5262.423,5266.527,Thank you.,135,,
676,0.97,5266.527,5269.864,I think Greg covered it very thoroughly.,135,,
677,0.97,5269.864,5298.826,This cut in overtime simply establishes the 2021 overtime budget to be the same as the revised level or 2020 as proposed by the Mayor and adopted by the Council during the supplemental budget process.,135,,
678,0.97,5298.826,5299.327,Additional comments?,136,,
679,0.97,5299.327,5299.761,Council President?,136,,
680,0.97,5299.761,5308.002,"Yes, I think this is a really important addition that can't, um, be Underemphasized here.",137,,
681,0.97,5308.002,5313.641,I really want to thank Council member Herbold for advancing this particular Council budget action.,137,,
682,0.97,5313.641,5339.333,"I think a lot of folks don't understand that in this budgeting exercise we do, every year the city council establishes an overtime allocation to the Seattle police Department, and every year they blow right through that budget as though the city council didn't even set a budget in the first place for overtime.",137,,
683,0.97,5339.333,5353.347,"It is maddening, it's frustrating, and I think it's in many ways a disregard of this Council, who's the legislative Department and branch for the city government.",137,,
684,0.97,5353.347,5357.552,It's a disregard for our budget appropriation authority.,137,,
685,0.97,5357.552,5361.923,And I understand there are circumstances in which overtime can't be avoided.,137,,
686,0.97,5361.923,5403.097,"But I think the Delta we've continuously seen between what we appropriate and what the police Department ultimately spends is rather significant and sense I've been on the Council and I was the budget safety chair for four years, every single year this has been a real frustration for me, and I think the members of the public deserve to understand how SPD is utilizing these general fund dollars to continue to pay overtime to sworn personnel.",137,,
687,0.97,5403.097,5414.876,"In some instances paying them for more hours than exist in a day, and others it's paying them for more hours that exist in a week.",137,,
688,0.97,5414.876,5420.214,So I think for us it's important to rein in on this.,137,,
689,0.97,5420.214,5436.33,"It still allows for some overtime, but acknowledges the current burning through time at SPD is not sustainable or reasonable.",137,,
690,0.97,5436.33,5446.407,"We should all be supporting this proposal as good governing to say we're serious when we say you have X number of dollars for overtime, and that's it.",137,,
691,0.97,5446.407,5478.072,"And if you need more, it's up to you, Seattle police Department, to come to us in advance to ask us for additional funds for overtime, and we're happy to consider the requests, but I think it's no longer sustainable, particularly in this recession time we're in, to give them a blank check and have them have the culture of knowing we'll pay for their overtime no matter what.",137,,
692,0.97,5478.072,5489.45,"I really want to thank Council member Herbold for advancing this particular Council budget action, and I'm proud to be a cosponsor on it.",137,,
693,0.97,5489.45,5490.184,Thank you.,138,,
694,0.97,5490.184,5491.219,Additional comments or questions?,138,,
695,0.97,5491.219,5508.035,"Greg, to the point the Council President just made, I want to double check one comment from the overview.",138,,
696,0.97,5508.035,5537.131,"It was said there was less need due to Covid and events in the city, but I thought there was actually a significant Overuse of overtime by the time the budget was presented because so much overtime was already spent as well with the multiple day in a row protests and police response in the streets for 10 plus days.",138,,
697,0.97,5537.131,5548.509,If you remind me how those activities factored into the overtime usage and what the Mayor ultimately sent down?,138,,
698,0.97,5548.509,5548.91,Sure.,139,,
699,0.97,5548.91,5551.946,Those two things are different.,139,,
700,0.97,5551.946,5553.247,I want to address them separately.,139,,
701,0.97,5553.247,5569.664,"The Mayor sent down in July a budget that adjusted overtime for Covid, and it was that Bdget that reduced the, it was that proposal that reduced the overtime budget to I believe I said 21.2.",139,,
702,0.97,5569.664,5574.302,I have to go back to my notes.,139,,
703,0.97,5574.302,5575.269,"Yes, 21.2.",139,,
704,0.97,5575.269,5591.385,"So the Mayor sent down a proposal in July that cut the budget to 21.2, and that was solely to reflect the, um, lessening demand because of Covid.",139,,
705,0.97,5591.385,5599.66,"That was the lessening of need for patrols or sports, traffic, community engagement.",139,,
706,0.97,5599.66,5601.495,All the things not happening because of Covid.,139,,
707,0.97,5601.495,5607.802,That's what the Mayor reduced in July.,139,,
708,0.97,5607.802,5618.98,"Then, Separately, the actions of the demonstrations created a rather significant overtime expense, and SPD had to deal with that expense by making other reductions in their budget.",139,,
709,0.97,5618.98,5640.034,"One of the ways they did that was implementing a hiring freeze for the rest of 2020, and they made other reductions in 2020 to address the overtime overspending.",139,,
710,0.97,5640.034,5649.243,"So kind of two separate things if you take it out of the picture, it's just the Covid piece captured here in this reduction.",139,,
711,0.97,5649.243,5657.451,"It's just assuming that Covid would go on, that there's going to be a lack of demand for services next year.",139,,
712,0.97,5657.451,5669.764,"If the, um, SPD were to go past the 21.2 because of let's say demonstration costs in the future, they'd have to find another way to pay for that just as they are this year.",139,,
713,0.97,5669.764,5672.133,Hopefully that's making some sense.,139,,
714,0.97,5672.133,5673.534,Yes.,140,,
715,0.97,5673.534,5677.371,"And to the Council President's overall point, good governing policy embedded into the piece.",140,,
716,0.97,5677.371,5680.574,Thank you very much Council member Herbold.,140,,
717,0.97,5680.574,5687.481,"I see Council members Morales, Sawant, Pederson, Strauss, Lewis, and Council President signed on to this item.",140,,
718,0.97,5687.481,5687.782,Let's move on.,140,,
719,0.97,5689.116,5705.199,"All right, so the next one is Spd011A-011 imposing a $5 million proviso for SPD for attrition savings.",141,,
720,0.97,5705.199,5730.291,"We've been talking a lot about attrition and how the staffing model that's put out every year does the best it can to predict attrition, but, um, it has on occasion, frequently over the last few years, um, been a little off and the attrition, or a lot off, and the attrition has been more significant than what SPD thought it would be.",141,,
721,0.97,5730.291,5746.373,"And so if I were to sum up this action, what I would say is that the Council is Proactivity holding aside $5 million from the assumption that attrition will again be lower than the Department predicts.",141,,
722,0.97,5746.373,5771.966,"They're taking the $5 million, and you'd take that $5 million and looking it up under a proviso and holding it to see how attrition turns out, and if attrition didn't happen in excess of planned projections, then you could release the proviso and return the funding to SPD.",141,,
723,0.97,5771.966,5822.883,"If Attritin did happen in excess, more people left the Department than originally thought, than the $5 million would be available through a future ordinance to again put in finance general and dedicate to recommendations around par test Participatory budgeting.",141,,
724,0.97,5822.883,5823.784,Council member Herbold?,142,,
725,0.97,5823.784,5834.495,Yes the last several years they haven't met their staffing charges and ended up with a significant Underspend.,143,,
726,0.97,5834.495,5839.333,I mentioned this with regard to a few items ago.,143,,
727,0.97,5839.333,5855.115,"This proviso would assure that if and when attrition occurs in 2021, any additional savings wouldn't be, excuse me, would be retained and not spent by SPD.",143,,
728,0.97,5855.115,5868.162,"With this proviso, the Council will capture these savings and Reappropriate them through a supplemental budget action to support the recommendations through the community through a Participatory budget process.",143,,
729,0.97,5868.162,5894.488,"This is consistent with the actions presented in the two previous city budget actions and collectively help ensure we reduce the size and scope of the SPD by focusing our efforts on positions that are vacant and reverse, Accordingly reverse decades of Overinvestment.",143,,
730,0.97,5894.488,5935.229,"This is just a recognition that, again, similar to one of my previous, um, council budget actions related to vacancy savings, that every year when we go through the budgeting exercise, we realize six months later or three months later, for example, that the forecasting model related to projecting attrition was a little, was inaccurate or overestimated the amount of attrition that would occur.",143,,
731,0.97,5935.229,5953.547,So this is the mechanism the Council has available to prevent the Underspends from being spent by SPD before we have an opportunity to weigh in as to how the Underspent dollars would be spent.,143,,
732,0.97,5953.547,5964.158,"In this instance the proviso indicates if there's an Overspend, it would go towards the Participatory budget process.",143,,
733,0.97,5964.158,5981.375,So this is a Proactive step towards potentially capturing any Underspend in the hiring area of SPD's budget should the future attrition be more significant than anticipated.,143,,
734,0.97,5981.375,5981.675,Thank you.,143,,
735,0.97,5981.675,5983.444,Thank you Council President.,144,,
736,0.97,5983.444,5990.084,I will also NOTE I received confirmation from Council member Juarez that she'd like to sign onto this item.,144,,
737,0.97,5990.084,5991.685,Also the previous item.,144,,
738,0.97,5991.685,5996.056,Thank Yu very much Council member Juarez.,144,,
739,0.97,5996.056,6007.401,We'll be sure to note that as well.,144,,
740,0.97,6007.401,6008.902,Any additional comments on questions on Spd011A001?,144,,
741,0.97,6008.902,6009.203,Okay.,144,,
742,0.97,6009.203,6011.271,Great.,144,,
743,0.97,6011.271,6015.275,I am not seeing it at this time.,144,,
744,0.97,6015.275,6018.612,I think we have one more cosponsor on this item.,144,,
745,0.97,6018.612,6022.883,"And great, let me just summarize for folks.",144,,
746,0.97,6022.883,6037.865,"Council President is joined by Council members Herbold, Morales, Sawant, Juarez, Strauss, and Lewis.",144,,
747,0.97,6037.865,6039.733,Thank you very much.,144,,
748,0.97,6039.733,6047.274,The next Council budget action would aggregate 70 unfilled positions in the Seattle police Department.,145,,
749,0.97,6047.274,6062.756,"So by way of background in the 2021 proposed budget, the Mayor reduced funding, took funding out for 97 positions in SPD, but only eliminated 47 of the positions.",145,,
750,0.97,6062.756,6070.564,"So what they did was left 50 unfunded, unfilled positions sitting on the books.",145,,
751,0.97,6070.564,6078.172,"And what this CBA would do is remove the 50 unfunded, unfilled positions.",145,,
752,0.97,6078.172,6094.588,"As we've been talking about, the staffing plan indicates they're not going to be able to fill all of the positions that they are funded for this year.",145,,
753,0.97,6094.588,6102.663,So these are positions that are funded but won't be able to be filled and would reduce a total of 70 positions.,145,,
754,0.97,6102.663,6130.891,"The funding that's associated with the 20 I just mentioned is captured already in one of Council member Gonzalez's proposals, that's the proposal that as discussed captures all the vacancy savings, and so once that's captured, the 20 positions become unfunded and now you have 70 positions unfunded and unfilled.",145,,
755,0.97,6130.891,6134.328,"Can't be filled, and could be reduced from the Department's budget.",145,,
756,0.97,6134.328,6143.637,"And this is brought to you, as I mentioned, by Council President Gonzalez.",145,,
757,0.97,6143.637,6145.038,Thank you very much.,146,,
758,0.97,6145.038,6148.008,Council President?,146,,
759,0.97,6148.008,6152.045,Thank you chair and Greg for that description.,147,,
760,0.97,6152.045,6156.149,"Also thanks to my original cosponsors, Council members Herbold and Morales.",147,,
761,0.97,6156.149,6161.021,"As central staff just described, SPD has position authority for 1,450 sworn officer positions.",147,,
762,0.97,6161.021,6168.629,Dozens more than the staffing model predicts to have on the force at any point in 2021.,147,,
763,0.97,6168.629,6182.142,"This proposed budget action would eliminate 70 excess position pockets as we like to refer to them at the city, allowing 1,380 positions to remain.",147,,
764,0.97,6182.142,6190.45,This is sufficient to account for the maximum number of sworn officers that SPD anticipates employing during 2021.,147,,
765,0.97,6190.45,6226.82,"By aggregating these 70 positions, we effectively remove the Seattle police Department's legal authority to Rehire for those positions in the future without explicit legislative other approval, so SPD may want to have additional positions in the future and should they want that, there's nothing that prohibits them from seeking approval from the city council in order to to create additional positions beyond those which they currently have should these various actions be adopted by the chair and full council.",147,,
766,0.97,6226.82,6231.291,So really excited to advance this.,147,,
767,0.97,6231.291,6283.977,"There is, as Greg mentioned, no fiscal impact as the positions are largely vacant and unfunded, so this is just, again, acknowledging that because they're vacant and unfunded, that there's a risk they could some day be proposed to be funded and filled, and I believe it's appropriate for us to wait for the Mayor's task force to finish its Interdisciplinary Department task force work related to evaluation of the function analysis at the Seattle police Department, and so this is a, I think, a reasonable approach to making sure that, um, these positions aren't ultimately funded for and hired before the work comes to a conclusion.",147,,
768,0.97,6283.977,6284.678,Thank you.,147,,
769,0.97,6284.678,6286.179,"Thank you, Council President.",148,,
770,0.97,6286.179,6295.288,And want to also NOTE we received confirmation that Council member Juarez would also like to sign on to this item.,148,,
771,0.97,6295.288,6297.591,"Council member Morales, did you have a comment on this one?",148,,
772,0.97,6297.591,6301.461,"Yes, I actually have a question for Greg.",149,,
773,0.97,6301.461,6314.975,I would like a little bit of clarification if you don't mind.,149,,
774,0.97,6314.975,6318.512,I'm trying to distinguish between the aggregation and hiring freeze.,149,,
775,0.97,6318.512,6332.726,"You said we could achieve a savings of about 15 million, that if the Mayor extended the hiring freeze into 2021, is that right?",149,,
776,0.97,6332.726,6333.994,That's correct.,150,,
777,0.97,6333.994,6334.194,15.7.,150,,
778,0.97,6334.194,6334.494,Okay.,151,,
779,0.97,6334.494,6336.53,"So I'm sorry, about how many positions would that be?",151,,
780,0.97,6336.53,6343.437,I'd have to go back to my notes.,152,,
781,0.97,6343.437,6345.639,I don't know right off.,152,,
782,0.97,6345.639,6350.444,"Sorry, I do have that.",153,,
783,0.97,6350.444,6351.945,Well.,153,,
784,0.97,6351.945,6353.714,"About 130 maybe, but more or less.",153,,
785,0.97,6353.714,6360.02,"But a freeze, first of all, a freeze means those positions could be hired back later.",153,,
786,0.97,6360.02,6360.654,Yes.,154,,
787,0.97,6360.654,6361.555,Okay.,155,,
788,0.97,6361.555,6392.252,"So I just want to make sure I understand that we could potentially have, at least for 2021, have another $15 million to invest in black and Brown communities to support the Participatory budget process, but I want to make sure I understand that the Council doesn't actually have authority through a proviso or budget process to impose a hiring freeze?",155,,
789,0.97,6392.252,6396.056,I believe that's technically true.,156,,
790,0.97,6396.056,6404.464,I believe the Council can take away the money that the Department would use to hire officers.,156,,
791,0.97,6404.464,6420.814,Going to the level of prohibiting the chief from hiring officers may conflict with the chief controlling public safety services in the city.,156,,
792,0.97,6420.814,6424.918,That would be something that had to be looked at.,156,,
793,0.97,6424.918,6453.647,"But I could tell you that from a fiscal standpoint if the Department was 15.7 million, if it had 15.7 million less by way of funding authority, that's the lever they'd have to pull they'd have to either greatly reduce overtime, but because there are not a lot of other levers to pull, they'd probably have to freeze hiring.",156,,
794,0.97,6453.647,6463.924,"As you know from the presentations we've had the last few months, most of their budget is salary and benefits for their existing people.",156,,
795,0.97,6463.924,6466.827,"So, Yeah, I think that's the case.",156,,
796,0.97,6466.827,6480.874,"We would, staff could do more research to find out if for sure by proviso the Department could be prevented from hiring.",156,,
797,0.97,6480.874,6483.076,But I think probably it's the case that they could Notment.,156,,
798,0.97,6483.076,6490.884,"It is the my understanding, and if there's more, um, you know, if we could uncover that a little bit, it would be helpful to know.",157,,
799,0.97,6490.884,6509.736,"But it's my understanding that it's an administrative function of the executive, so the Abrogation would allow us to, you know, as the Council President said, eliminate the funds and positions all together.",157,,
800,0.97,6509.736,6519.512,"I just want to make sure I understand the two different, um, options and why we might choose one or the other, and if both might be available, that would be good to know too.",157,,
801,0.97,6519.512,6525.585,I'd like to follow up with you on that.,157,,
802,0.97,6525.585,6528.288,"Yeah, absolutely.",158,,
803,0.97,6528.288,6532.525,"And, um, you're right.",158,,
804,0.97,6532.525,6544.537,"The, um, the Abrogation of the positions under Council President Gonzlez's proposal doesn't effect hiring for this year.",158,,
805,0.97,6544.537,6563.456,"It's simply for positions that can't be filled because there's just not, they can't get recruits in the door fast enough to fill those, and they know it.",158,,
806,0.97,6563.456,6565.258,So those Abrogations wouldn't effect the Department's hiring.,158,,
807,0.97,6565.258,6578.271,"If you were to freeze hiring as officers left the force and the force got smaller, you could Abrogate positions, and prohibit the Department from filling those later.",158,,
808,0.97,6578.271,6584.177,I think that's what you're Articulating.,158,,
809,0.97,6584.177,6584.444,Okay.,159,,
810,0.97,6584.444,6587.48,Thank you.,159,,
811,0.97,6587.48,6587.948,Appreciate that.,159,,
812,0.97,6587.948,6588.882,Any additional questions?,160,,
813,0.97,6588.882,6591.384,I want to make sure we have all the cosponsors.,160,,
814,0.97,6591.384,6596.489,I think we have them all listed there.,160,,
815,0.97,6596.489,6611.304,"Council President Gonzalez, you're joined by Council members Herbold, Sawant, Strauss, Morales and Lewis.",160,,
816,0.97,6611.304,6622.582,"The next is Spd010001, and this would cut $175,000 from SPD's travel and training Úbudget.",161,,
817,0.97,6622.582,6632.726,Add that $175 to finance general and proviso it.,161,,
818,0.97,6632.726,6638.398,Restricted for future spending resulting from the Participatory budget process.,161,,
819,0.97,6638.398,6655.448,"The 2021 training budget is about 1.1 million and used to fund civilian training, continuing education, some required under the consent decree.",161,,
820,0.97,6655.448,6686.646,"Just by way of providing more context, this particular action would reduce from the budget of 1.1 million, 175,000 and would leave about 925,000 for SPD to continue to use for travel and training, and it's the intent of the Council by passing this action, it would not impede the Department's, um, from filling the requirements of the consent decree.",161,,
821,0.97,6686.646,6698.458,And this is brought to you by Council member Herbold.,161,,
822,0.97,6698.458,6699.459,Thank you.,162,,
823,0.97,6699.459,6720.914,"This item, the one following it, as well as the overtime and out of order lay off discussion is really just making sure that the decisions we made for the last four months of 2020 are decisions that we, um, Restarbuckses reductions in the area are what we carry forward for the 2021 budget as well.",162,,
824,0.97,6720.914,6734.327,"As Greg explained, the proposed cut is based on the Reductin and size of force, and less travel due to Covid-19.",162,,
825,0.97,6734.327,6752.912,"And for context, the 2020 budget for travel and training was $1.1 million, and of that, only 178,000 was spent in 2020.",162,,
826,0.97,6752.912,6768.261,"Again, this is a similar sized reduction based on our experiences in 2020, but also recognizing that there will be a smaller size force in 2021 as well.",162,,
827,0.97,6768.261,6775.335,Thank you Council member Herbold.,163,,
828,0.97,6775.335,6777.07,Any additional questions?,163,,
829,0.97,6777.07,6778.304,I'm not hearing or seeing any.,163,,
830,0.97,6778.304,6789.883,"Council member Herbold, thank you so much.",163,,
831,0.97,6789.883,6791.551,"You're joined by Sawant, Strauss, Morales, and Gonzalez.",163,,
832,0.97,6791.551,6795.788,Let's go on.,163,,
833,0.97,6795.788,6798.892,The next one is Spd014A001.,164,,
834,0.97,6798.892,6805.899,"This particular Council budget action would cut 300,000 from Seattle police Department's discretionary purchase budget.",164,,
835,0.97,6805.899,6822.215,"Again, take that 300,000 and move it to finance general and restrict it so it's used later for the Participatory budget process.",164,,
836,0.97,6822.215,6827.921,The discretionary purchase budget in 2021 is 4.4 million.,164,,
837,0.97,6827.921,6843.636,"It's used to fund office supplies, software, equipment purchases, Wireless charges, advertising, a whole range of different operational items.",164,,
838,0.97,6843.636,6849.442,"This Cva after the $300,000 reduction would leave 4.1 million in the discretionary purchase budget.",164,,
839,0.97,6849.442,6855.215,It's brought to you again by Council member Herbold.,164,,
840,0.97,6855.215,6855.582,Thank you.,165,,
841,0.97,6855.582,6856.382,Council member Herbold?,165,,
842,0.97,6856.382,6856.816,Sorry.,166,,
843,0.97,6856.816,6864.757,I don't think there's a whole bunch to adhere on this one.,166,,
844,0.97,6864.757,6869.128,Greg covered it well.,166,,
845,0.97,6869.128,6875.235,It's a modest size reduction in the discretionary budget line item.,166,,
846,0.97,6875.235,6885.278,"$300,000 from a $4.4 million line item.",166,,
847,0.97,6885.278,6886.379,Thank you.,166,,
848,0.97,6886.379,6899.893,I'd welcome additional sponsors so we could continue to additional funds to our Participatory budget process.,166,,
849,0.97,6899.893,6906.199,Thank you very much Council member Herbold.,167,,
850,0.97,6906.199,6911.037,I'll come back to this question because I can't read my hand writing.,167,,
851,0.97,6911.037,6913.439,"I see Council member Pederson,",167,,
852,0.97,6913.439,6914.574,Thank you.,168,,
853,0.97,6914.574,6933.092,"Appreciate the con text everybody is providing with these different budget actions in terms of, um, you know, happy to support the information gathering, the Statemets of legislative intent, and appreciate how some of these are framed as Provisos so there's some flexibility later.",168,,
854,0.97,6933.092,6944.304,I just want to have some more time to assess all these because a lot of these were posted 24 hours ago and there are different piecemeal things.,168,,
855,0.97,6944.304,6965.892,"I don't know if, um, folks have had a chance to check in with the chief of police yet about any of these items.",168,,
856,0.97,6967.794,6973.066,What's the status of the money that we had already provided for this?,168,,
857,0.97,6973.066,6974.167,For that process?,168,,
858,0.97,6974.167,6985.778,I thought that the Council had ultimately gotten more money from the legislative Department to do the process and the Mayor also has a process for soliciting input?,168,,
859,0.97,6985.778,6998.891,What I know is that the legislative branch has $3 million for the process and I saw an E-mail that they're getting ready to get a contract.,169,,
860,0.97,6998.891,7011.17,"If Dan or Aly on the line, they might be able to jump in and provide more information on that.",169,,
861,0.97,7011.17,7012.372,Thanks Greg.,170,,
862,0.97,7012.372,7014.107,"Oh, if Dan is here.",170,,
863,0.97,7014.107,7018.311,"Okay, I didn't want to talk over him.",170,,
864,0.97,7018.311,7018.711,There he is.,170,,
865,0.97,7018.711,7020.279,"Interim director, take it away.",170,,
866,0.97,7020.279,7023.983,Thank you both for being with us.,171,,
867,0.97,7023.983,7032.992,"Sorry, I was struggling to find the right Toggles to get onto the video.",172,,
868,0.97,7032.992,7041.834,"Um, the, my understanding is that the legislative Department has issued a contract for the $3 million.",172,,
869,0.97,7041.834,7055.882,"The auditor of the project manager, and I don't have the scope before me, but that contract was just let and work is now underway.",172,,
870,0.97,7055.882,7065.324,But I can it's been a couple of weeks since the contract was officially signed.,172,,
871,0.97,7065.324,7095.688,"And I would just add that my understanding is the distinction here is this money and the other money described in the proposals today are to have money available that would be given to community or directed through a Participatory budget in process, and the first $3 million investment is in part setting up the process and the infrastructure for how that dispersement process would work.",173,,
872,0.97,7095.688,7109.001,So the $3 million is an initial investment to get the sort of instruction for lack of a better word in place for a larger Participatory budgeting process.,173,,
873,0.97,7109.001,7110.703,Well said.,174,,
874,0.97,7110.703,7112.805,"Thank you very much, council member Pederson.",175,,
875,0.97,7112.805,7115.875,That gave me time to read my notes from late last night.,175,,
876,0.97,7115.875,7129.989,"I wondered when we look at this item related to the supplies, um, making sure I'm on the right one.",175,,
877,0.97,7129.989,7130.823,Okay.,175,,
878,0.97,7130.823,7145.438,"On the second page here on the document central staff provided, we talk about the largest two categories of the year to date spending in this budget area are supplies operating and supplies other at $1.5 million apiece.",175,,
879,0.97,7145.438,7149.942,Staff is working with SPD to obtain more information about the expenses.,175,,
880,0.97,7149.942,7164.09,I just wanted to ask how this amount of supplies spending compares to other departments.,175,,
881,0.97,7164.09,7171.13,"Is there anything, is this an Outlier or what you expect?",175,,
882,0.97,7171.13,7172.565,I'm not sure.,176,,
883,0.97,7172.565,7198.357,"You know, at the level of staff that SPD has and at the cost of the equipment that they need replaced, everything from batteries to their radios or right up to rifles or hand guns, that would be a difficult comparison.",176,,
884,0.97,7198.357,7210.903,That's something I could look at doing to see if it's proportionately more.,176,,
885,0.97,7210.903,7213.406,"I would assume it is, but I'm not sure.",176,,
886,0.97,7213.406,7226.686,"The best way would be a per officer kind of look across multiple departments, multiple police departments.",176,,
887,0.97,7226.686,7228.621,Departments in other jurisdictions.,176,,
888,0.97,7228.621,7230.189,Difficult to do quickly.,176,,
889,0.97,7230.189,7233.726,And you answered part of the question embedded in that.,177,,
890,0.97,7233.726,7242.201,"Are weapons included in the supply category, and it sounds like that's accurate.",177,,
891,0.97,7242.201,7245.238,"Yes, they are.",178,,
892,0.97,7245.238,7260.853,"In fact, even as ballistic helmets were something SPD had to replace all the ballistic helmets this year due to an Osha update in requirements.",178,,
893,0.97,7260.853,7266.826,"I believe they spent 81,000 this year out of this category.",178,,
894,0.97,7266.826,7270.563,So it really runs the gambit.,178,,
895,0.97,7270.563,7271.664,Even right down to office furniture.,178,,
896,0.97,7271.664,7274.6,"Okay, thank you so much.",179,,
897,0.97,7274.6,7277.77,That was my question.,179,,
898,0.97,7277.77,7286.012,"Council member Herbold is joined by Council members Morales, Sawant, Strauss, and Council President Gonzalez.",179,,
899,0.97,7286.012,7289.582,"Okay, next item.",179,,
900,0.97,7289.582,7304.096,"The next item is Spd015A001, and this Council budget action would cut a $450,000 from the Department.",180,,
901,0.97,7304.096,7314.974,"A $450,000 contract specifically that's currently representing or paying for five mental health professionals that work on the crisis response unit.",180,,
902,0.97,7314.974,7331.59,"Just to back up a bit, the crisis response unit is where a mental health professional is paired with a police officer, and the two together answer a 911 call, usually when a person is in crisis.",180,,
903,0.97,7331.59,7349.041,"And so the city currently employs five of the mental health providers, pairs them with five officers, and the cost for those five mental health providers contracted with Desc is $450,000.",180,,
904,0.97,7349.041,7360.986,"That $450,000 would be cut from the Department, and instead of contracted out of SPD, they would contract out of Hsd.",180,,
905,0.97,7360.986,7364.457,"From an operational standpoint, nothing would change.",180,,
906,0.97,7364.457,7374.533,"You'd still have five mental health providers paired up with five officers, it's just the contract would be moved out of SPD and into Hsd.",180,,
907,0.97,7374.533,7389.081,"The second part of this action is to add about 11 more mental health providers to the team, costing a million dollars.",180,,
908,0.97,7389.081,7402.595,So this would add to the Hsd community safety division a million dollars to hire 11 more outside organization mental health providers.,180,,
909,0.97,7402.595,7413.973,"Just to provide a little background, those teams respond to 911 calls for individuals experiencing chronic and acute behavioral health issues.",180,,
910,0.97,7413.973,7438.697,"Most of those calls come in under a broad category called disturbances, and when a crisis response unit rolls up on a disturbance, which is a person in crisis a lot of times, that's when the mental health provider will be the one that initially engages with the person in crisis, and the officer will stand back and ensure what they call scene safety.",180,,
911,0.97,7438.697,7461.687,"So SPD has indicated that there are many 911 response calls that come in in this category that could benefit from a team response rather than just a police officer, but they need more medical responders to do that, and this would increase that by 11.",180,,
912,0.97,7461.687,7479.238,And this action is brought by Council member Strauss.,180,,
913,0.97,7479.238,7482.875,"Sorry, I was on mute.",181,,
914,0.97,7482.875,7483.943,"Council member Strauss, please go ahead.",181,,
915,0.97,7483.943,7488.48,"My protocol, my deference to protocol is deep within my bones.",182,,
916,0.97,7488.48,7491.417,"Thank you chair, thank you Greg.",182,,
917,0.97,7491.417,7502.394,"As Greg mentioned, SPD's crisis response units contract with Desc to assign mental health professionals to respond to calls for people in crisis.",182,,
918,0.97,7502.394,7518.811,It allows for them to handle verbal engagement with the individual in crisis as they're better trained to deal with behavioral health issues in crisis situations in a Deescalating manner and provides them the security they need to ensure they're safety.,182,,
919,0.97,7518.811,7530.523,"This proposal would remove the existing $450,000 of funding for the cry success response unit from the Seattle police Department and shift it to Hsd.",182,,
920,0.97,7530.523,7542.935,It would also increase the funding to Hsd to add an additional million dollars to hire more mental health professionals for this work.,182,,
921,0.97,7542.935,7546.505,The unit currently consists of five per precinct.,182,,
922,0.97,7546.505,7551.744,"It's my belief we need many, many more per precinct.",182,,
923,0.97,7551.744,7561.453,"For instance, the North precinct covers three Council district compared to other precinct.",182,,
924,0.97,7561.453,7573.465,"There are many more 911 calls that merit a mental health response than they have the capacity to meet, so the additional funding would allow Hsd to hire an additional 11 mental health professionals for a total of 16.",182,,
925,0.97,7573.465,7586.979,"Again, I think this number is still too low, and I understand with our overall budget deficit that this is, um, a good step forward.",182,,
926,0.97,7586.979,7590.382,I again think we need more than 16.,182,,
927,0.97,7590.382,7598.424,"This would allow for 2 mental health professionals per Precinct, and 5 who would form the decentralized third watch.",182,,
928,0.97,7598.424,7605.297,The city could deploy them to respond to a greater portion of 911 calls rather than relying only on an armed response.,182,,
929,0.97,7605.297,7629.755,"In all honesty, as I said, I believe we need to double or triple the amount of funding for mental health professionals, and this is an important action because it's a bridge during this historic transition until we're able to stand up the other departments and organizations to be responsive to 911 calls, we need more mental health professionals tied with SPD officers.",182,,
930,0.97,7629.755,7640.099,"Lastly, Greg, did we hear also this is the direction that New York City is moving as a bridge in transition as well?",182,,
931,0.97,7640.099,7654.913,"I heard the council member from New York City say that during meetings last July, that they were greatly increasing their crisis response unit, mental health professionals.",183,,
932,0.97,7654.913,7663.856,But I have not followed up to see how their budget ultimately wound up.,183,,
933,0.97,7663.856,7664.59,Thank you.,184,,
934,0.97,7664.59,7668.36,Go ahead Council member Strauss.,184,,
935,0.97,7668.36,7669.261,Just saying thank you.,185,,
936,0.97,7669.261,7671.53,Thank you very much Council member Strauss.,186,,
937,0.97,7671.53,7673.298,"The council member Lewis, go ahead.",186,,
938,0.97,7673.298,7674.066,Thank you.,187,,
939,0.97,7674.066,7680.039,And I'm happy to cosponsor this one with Council member Strauss.,187,,
940,0.97,7680.039,7696.755,"I did a ride along with the crisis intervention team over the summer, and it was a really great experience to see, um, this team up close that provides a vital function of the sworn personnel and civilian personnel on the team.",187,,
941,0.97,7696.755,7713.205,"I just want to flag going forward, I appreciate that we're proposing to add an additional 11 Mhps to this team.",187,,
942,0.97,7713.205,7742.0,"There were broad categories of the calls where the Desc workers could respond without the presence and assistance of, um, a police officer, though there were certainly still some calls that potentially pose a higher, um, safety risk to the Desc worker or the public that would still require the presence of an officer.",187,,
943,0.97,7742.0,7772.631,"But as we go down the road of Scaling up types of response, I'm just flagging for central staff, and I don't know if we'd incorporate it into this, but to reiterate a comment from last week, I'd be interested in sort of the Venn diagram of the overlap of the different response systems and really assessing, you know, CIT has a really good platform and Hub for this response the way it's built right now.",187,,
944,0.97,7772.631,7805.797,"But if we're going down a path where, um, they're doing solely civilian dispatches as part of the team, I wonder if that would be better handled by a continued expansion of health one and for the future of CIT to be more focused toward responding to incidents where an armed officer by the admission of the service providers would be a good companion for a worker to go.",187,,
945,0.97,7805.797,7822.014,"So really just assessing how this moves forward with Provider-Based dispatch like cahoots or Star model, and also health one, the firefighter behavioral mental health worker partnership.",187,,
946,0.97,7822.014,7824.183,Thank you.,188,,
947,0.97,7824.183,7825.217,I hear what you're saying.,188,,
948,0.97,7825.217,7857.049,"It's, um, I think as the committee has discussed, the executive is undertaking an exercise with an interdepartmental team that's looking at figuring out how to change deployment along the lines of what you're suggesting where a cahoots style mental health employee could be deployed.",188,,
949,0.97,7857.049,7868.16,"And this particular action could work in, um, in concert with that effort in the sense that these folks are on contract.",188,,
950,0.97,7868.16,7905.597,"They're not permanent city employees, and so I would assume, it seems like more of a stop gap measure that Council member Strauss is introducing, and that's what I thought I heard you say.",188,,
951,0.97,7905.597,7906.465,Any additional questions?,189,,
952,0.97,7906.465,7909.401,"Okay, no additional questions at this time.",189,,
953,0.97,7909.401,7912.471,Thank you so much.,189,,
954,0.97,7912.471,7923.916,"We have Council members Herbold, Sawant, Pederson, and Lewis signing onto this one.",189,,
955,0.97,7923.916,7930.822,This is the last item for SPD on the agenda.,190,,
956,0.97,7930.822,7936.695,This is a proviso on SPD regarding harbor patrol functions.,190,,
957,0.97,7936.695,7962.254,"As you'll recall, there was a resolution requirement provide a report on the functions that might be transferred from the harbor patrol into the Seattle fire Department and this particular proviso would restrict $150,000 until that report is provided and request that the report be provided no later than may 24th.",190,,
958,0.97,7962.254,7965.29,"Thank you very much--Oh, so sorry Greg.",190,,
959,0.97,7965.29,7966.124,I'm sorry.,191,,
960,0.97,7966.124,7966.958,It's Council member Strauss.,191,,
961,0.97,7966.958,7969.995,"Thank you, council member Strauss, please go ahead.",192,,
962,0.97,7969.995,7972.965,"Thank you, chair, thank you Greg.",193,,
963,0.97,7972.965,7977.235,"Thank you cosponsors, Council President Gonzalez and Mosqueda.",193,,
964,0.97,7977.235,7993.685,"Earlier this year, as Greg mentioned, council passed the resolution asking SPD to report on a number of items, including an analysis of harbor patrol functions that could be transferred or Civilianized.",193,,
965,0.97,7993.685,8006.732,"I'd also like to note I think this report would be important to understand what functions could be transferred into a newly formed community safety Department for, um, a like or similar Department.",193,,
966,0.97,8006.732,8022.881,"While the resolution, as Greg mentioned, set the deadline for the report in October, SPD indicated it wouldn't respond in time and instead would include this as part of the departmental process.",193,,
967,0.97,8022.881,8035.727,"This brings us to the proviso which is about a month's worth of funding for harbor patrol of their 2021 budget, pending the receiving of that report by May 24th.",193,,
968,0.97,8035.727,8061.353,This would ensure we don't delay in receiving the information that will be valuable in informing future policy decisions about the harbor patrol because we need to ensure we have Proactive patrols in the fresh waters and at least the level of service we're receiving today at the termination of any transfers that occur.,193,,
969,0.97,8061.353,8064.256,Thank you Council member Strauss.,194,,
970,0.97,8064.256,8081.873,"I also appreciate this and know that, um, this type of information is going to really help us from a technical perspective for budgeting purposes.",194,,
971,0.97,8081.873,8084.076,Any additional questions or comments?,194,,
972,0.97,8084.076,8095.687,"We see Council President Gonzalez, joined by Council members Herbold, Morales, Sawant, and myself.",194,,
973,0.97,8095.687,8096.288,Let's go on.,194,,
974,0.97,8096.288,8120.679,"Council member Herbold, the next few come from you, and, um, with your indulgence and direction, I'm wondering if we might want to brief the body on a handful of these together and then be able to take them in individual order to see if there's additional cosponsors desired.",194,,
975,0.97,8120.679,8122.414,Would that make sense to you Council member Herbold?,194,,
976,0.97,8122.414,8127.619,It would.,195,,
977,0.97,8127.619,8144.503,"They're all part of a package, and I understand for procedural reasons we might need to ask for sponsors for each, but just as you see, I believe the sponsors for the same for all of them.",195,,
978,0.97,8144.503,8155.213,That's an indication when adding sponsors hopefully people will understand again these work together as a package.,195,,
979,0.97,8155.213,8160.552,"Great, Greg, does that work for you?",196,,
980,0.97,8160.552,8165.056,"Actually, thank you, council member.",197,,
981,0.97,8165.056,8166.158,"Lisa will be staffing this, so I'll say good Bye.",197,,
982,0.97,8166.158,8168.36,We'll see thank you and appreciate your time this week.,198,,
983,0.97,8168.36,8174.933,Have a great rest of your week if we don't see you.,198,,
984,0.97,8174.933,8176.768,Thank you very much.,198,,
985,0.97,8176.768,8177.302,"Hello, Lisa!",198,,
986,0.97,8177.302,8179.371,Hello Council members and budget chair.,199,,
987,0.97,8179.371,8181.306,I'll try and keep this as crisp and concise as possible.,199,,
988,0.97,8181.306,8185.544,It's the end of the day on Friday of a very long week for you.,199,,
989,0.97,8185.544,8199.09,"To give you this large overview of the package, I'll first describe the proposal to create a new community safety and communications center.",199,,
990,0.97,8199.09,8210.802,Then I'll briefly describe the axes that would actually shift those consistent with that proposal.,199,,
991,0.97,8210.802,8230.221,Lastly the statement of legislative intent to Colocates or Emergencying the 911 call centers.,199,,
992,0.97,8230.221,8236.194,Items 44 through 50 are sponsored by Council member Herbold.,199,,
993,0.97,8236.194,8241.333,I'll start with the Overarcing proposal first.,199,,
994,0.97,8241.333,8251.943,Item 44 on your agenda is Spd500A001 sponsored by Council member Herbold and cosponsored by Morales and Lewis.,199,,
995,0.97,8251.943,8269.261,"This action would create a new community safety and communications center consisting of the primary 911 crawl center, parking enforcement officers unit, and community service officers unit, each of which is currently located in the Seattle police Department.",199,,
996,0.97,8269.261,8286.745,"Recognizing the complexity of standing up this new center, the proposed action would establish a target action date of no later than June 1ST, 2021, and would provide a proviso giving the police Department temporary authority to continue the actions through the the June 1ST date.",199,,
997,0.97,8286.745,8290.649,"Lisa, could you just speak up a little bit as you're going.",200,,
998,0.97,8290.649,8291.249,"I'm so sorry, yes.",201,,
999,0.97,8291.249,8292.817,No problem.,202,,
1000,0.97,8292.817,8294.185,I will work on projecting.,203,,
1001,0.97,8294.185,8298.89,We are still working on a cost estimate for the new center.,203,,
1002,0.97,8298.89,8302.093,Our numbers at this point must be considered very preliminary.,203,,
1003,0.97,8302.093,8311.803,"We estimate the new center would require additional management and administrative support, costing about $600,000 for the months June through December.",203,,
1004,0.97,8311.803,8320.078,Actual cost will Department of course on the final organizational structure.,203,,
1005,0.97,8320.078,8327.986,There could also be additional moving costs to relocate the officers currently located in SPD.,203,,
1006,0.97,8327.986,8335.226,"Depending on the location and the configuration of the new facilities, it could range up to 750,000.",203,,
1007,0.97,8335.226,8342.434,I will now describe the four technical proposed Council budget actions that shift the resources and Ftes consistent with the proposal.,203,,
1008,0.97,8342.434,8357.582,"In the future we're hoping we'll be able to consolidate this so you won't have quite so many moving parts, but at this point in the process, we thought it was good to keep these separate.",203,,
1009,0.97,8357.582,8373.765,"Very briefly, items 45 and 49 together with item 51 that Council member Sawant presented earlier this year would transfer the Ftes, parking enforcement officers, and community service officers from SPD to the new center.",203,,
1010,0.97,8373.765,8379.804,I will correct the transactions shown on item 49 with Spd501A001.,203,,
1011,0.97,8379.804,8381.873,That was published by mistake.,203,,
1012,0.97,8381.873,8383.074,"It was a test, pilot project.",203,,
1013,0.97,8383.074,8387.345,"We're trying to get the system to work, so sorry about including that.",203,,
1014,0.97,8387.345,8388.279,"No problem, Lisa.",204,,
1015,0.97,8388.279,8397.255,"Hey, do you mind just for the viewing public one more time, can you identify the three that go together again?",204,,
1016,0.97,8397.255,8416.274,"Yes, so would it be easier for me, yes, item 45 is one of them, that's Spd200-A-001.",205,,
1017,0.97,8416.274,8422.614,Item 49 is Spd502-A-001.,205,,
1018,0.97,8422.614,8423.615,"And item 51, that's Spd600-A-001.",205,,
1019,0.97,8423.615,8436.427,So those are just the moving parts that transfer the resources and Ftes to support the setting up of the new center.,205,,
1020,0.97,8436.427,8449.441,"There's one more technical item I'd group together with this, and that's item 45 on the agenda which actually is the second item 45 on your agenda.",205,,
1021,0.97,8449.441,8454.546,It should be 46.,205,,
1022,0.97,8454.546,8461.252,"It's Spd201-A-001, and transfer the parking enforcement overtime to the new center so make sure the resources line up in the right place.",205,,
1023,0.97,8461.252,8470.595,That's also sponsored by Council member Herbold and cosponsored by Morales and Lewis.,205,,
1024,0.97,8470.595,8478.269,Next I'll describe the the proposed actions that would address the parking enforcement action scope of authority.,205,,
1025,0.97,8478.269,8488.346,These are items 47 and 48 sponsored by Council member Herbold and Lewis and Morales.,205,,
1026,0.97,8488.346,8518.042,"Item 47 is Spd202A001 and would recognize the parking enforcement officers interest in having expanded responsibilities which could include managing traffic at lighted intersections, red light camera and school zone enforcement, response to Non-Injury collisions, response to and reporting on minor thefts and car break INS and traffic control.",205,,
1027,0.97,8518.042,8529.821,"Item 48, Spd203-A-001 requests a report from the executive on the estimated number of Ftes required if their parking enforcement responsibilities were expanded.",205,,
1028,0.97,8529.821,8543.534,We note that expansion of the parking enforcement officers authority would be subject to bargaining and to the police Department granting special Commission to the parking enforcement officers that Aline with that authority.,205,,
1029,0.97,8543.534,8577.502,"Finally, and this is the last one, item 50, Spd503A-001 sponsored by Council member Herbold and cosponsored by Council President Gonzalez and Council member Strauss is a statement of legislative intent requiring a report by March 31st 2021 on potential economies of scale and benefits of costs associated with Colocating or merging the Seattle fire Department and Seattle police Department 911 call centers.",205,,
1030,0.97,8577.502,8578.436,That COMPLETES my overview.,205,,
1031,0.97,8578.436,8579.671,"Thank you, Lisa.",206,,
1032,0.97,8579.671,8583.575,I appreciate you packaging that together.,206,,
1033,0.97,8583.575,8588.246,I'll admit in reviewing these last night I was wondering if there were duplications.,206,,
1034,0.97,8588.246,8604.162,It was a really helpful idea from the prime sponsor to be able to see the whole picture on how the elements come together.,206,,
1035,0.97,8604.162,8607.599,"Council member Herbold, please go ahead.",206,,
1036,0.97,8607.599,8650.742,"Really appreciate the chair's willingness to organize this in a way that really does a great job of showing how all these actions work together to, um, to turn what is currently proposed to be, um, a, the, the proposal for a new Department to be a community safety and communications center that, um, with that name, it allows it to really be a home for more divisions beyond 911.",207,,
1037,0.97,8650.742,8672.563,"I think the title in the Mayor's proposal was really unnecessarily, and I don't think it was the executive's intent, but by having the focus on an emergency center, I think it really limited the ability to move other functions, other public safety functions into the Department.",207,,
1038,0.97,8672.563,8689.981,So naming it community safety and communications center I think lines up with the Council and with the executive and the community's vision for a new community safety Department.,207,,
1039,0.97,8689.981,8698.489,And also lined up with the parking enforcement officers desire to move into that Department and the community service officer programs.,207,,
1040,0.97,8698.489,8708.066,"But also, really importantly, as we've discussed, the interest of the parking enforcement officers to take on new responsibilities.",207,,
1041,0.97,8708.066,8717.475,"So again, appreciate all of the work that Lisa has done on this item.",207,,
1042,0.97,8717.475,8744.202,"I think it's really a critical anchor to Reimagining public safety for the city of Seattle, and she has appropriately taken what was one budget action and Parsed out how there's a need, a technical need to take several separate actions in order to accomplish the full vision.",207,,
1043,0.97,8744.202,8745.336,"So thanks again, Lisa.",207,,

1072,0.97,8875.766,8893.484,"This item would cut $15 million general fund from Seattle police and add $15 million general fund to the new community safety and communications center and transfer 120 parking enforcement officers, full time employees, from SPD to the new center.",213,,
1073,0.97,8893.484,8899.757,No additional comments on that one.,214,,
1074,0.97,8899.757,8905.463,Okay.,214,,
1075,0.97,8905.463,8907.131,Any questions or comments?,214,,
1076,0.97,8907.131,8917.475,I'll just make a few comments relevant to this item and others brought forward by Council member Herbold.,215,,
1077,0.97,8917.475,8921.045,I'm proud to stand with her on this issue.,215,,
1078,0.97,8921.045,8929.487,I want to give a shut out to the parking enforcement officers that called in and provided public comment this morning in strong numbers.,215,,
1079,0.97,8929.487,8948.773,I really think the parking enforcement officers will have a very big role to play in our efforts to have a more Community-Focused effort of public safety.,215,,
1080,0.97,8948.773,8959.35,"50% Bipoc work force, 50% women, fluent in different languages is exactly the kind of unit we need out in the community right now doing this kind of work.",215,,
1081,0.97,8959.35,8980.304,"I would just give a plug, but Philadelphia last year, as I've mentioned before passed a charter amendment creating a public service officer which has duties in line with those duties articulated in the letter we received from the parking enforcement officers Union.",215,,
1082,0.97,8980.304,8994.285,"As we go forward, it might be interesting to consider changing the name of parking enforcement officers if we're successful in broadening their role and broadening what we expect them to do.",215,,
1083,0.97,8994.285,8996.454,This is a really promising way forward.,215,,
1084,0.97,8996.454,9016.974,I think it's also a way for us to have more city employees out there in the field actually responding and taking reports when there's minor thefts and crimes from the public directly Interfacing with the public on long standing community issues.,215,,
1085,0.97,9016.974,9025.85,"It will be a big impact and effect felt beyond, even more Impactful than their current role.",215,,
1086,0.97,9025.85,9030.087,"Happy to support this, thanks to Council member Herbold for bringing this forward and developing it.",215,,

1091,0.97,9038.029,9052.943,"We got a letter from protect 17 about the parking enforcement officers, so I'm just trying to reconcile it with this proposed action today.",217,,
1092,0.97,9052.943,9064.155,"I don't know if you have this letter saying they oppose, that they want to go to Sdot which is what the Mayor proposed.",217,,
1093,0.97,9064.155,9068.392,Just trying to reconcile those two things.,217,,
1094,0.97,9068.392,9069.96,"Please, council member Herbold.",218,,
1095,0.97,9069.96,9076.467,"Yes, I've been in contact with protect 17 and have conversations with Sean.",219,,
1096,0.97,9076.467,9102.393,"There's, I believe, eight supervisors in the unit, so there's a different of opinion among the supervisors among the hundred some odd Peos under those supervisors, and that's just something we'll have to work out.",219,,
1097,0.97,9102.393,9102.793,Anything else?,220,,

1124,0.97,9226.584,9233.224,This is what I was referring to being great testimony this morning.,230,,

1126,0.97,9235.492,9236.727,I'll say a few quick words.,231,,
1127,0.97,9236.727,9246.303,Just wanting to flesh out where that interest lies.,231,,
1128,0.97,9246.303,9290.681,"The Peos are interested in, um managing traffic at lighted intersections, whether or not we're talking at both lighted and Unlighted intersections when talking about managing special events or, um, also flagging related to special events, flagging related to construction activities, addition there's a requirement in state law, that, um, the red light camera and school zone camera and transit Lane and block the box camera enforcement, that those functions be carried out by a police officer.",231,,
1129,0.97,9290.681,9306.864,But there is an allowance for what's called a special Commission.,231,,
1130,0.97,9306.864,9328.519,"Themore of these duties that don't require an armed police officer to fulfill, that the Peos can take on, the more police officers can focus on their core law enforcement mission and the more we can work to assist the chief in improving priority 911 call response.",231,,
1131,0.97,9328.519,9380.671,"In addition, they've identified interest in responding to Non-Injury collisions, because in those cases it's largely report taking that's necessary, responding to and reporting on minor thefts and car break INS, and we recognize these expanded responsibilities would be subject to bargaining and as I mentioned, um, this is a CBA that recognizes that interest and identifies that the Council is interested in working with the unions and Department on changing those roles.",231,,
1132,0.97,9380.671,9381.271,Thank you.,232,,
1133,0.97,9381.271,9384.108,Additional comments or questions?,232,,

1136,0.97,9392.015,9396.453,"I would just mention, and you know, central staff could jump in too on this.",233,,
1137,0.97,9396.453,9412.269,"There are a number of civilian departments in the city, in particular Finance administrative services with a significant density of employees that have such special commissions that are civilians and conduct investigations.",233,,
1138,0.97,9412.269,9427.518,"The biggest example would be for hire vehicle violation investigations are done by, um, special investigators in FAS that have such commissions, but are not themselves peace officers or police.",233,,
1139,0.97,9427.518,9448.405,"So there's precedent in how the city Countly does its business, and hopefully that can be Replicated in expanding the role of Peos and getting a similar arrangement for them.",233,,
1140,0.97,9448.405,9452.442,Additional comments or questions?,234,,
1141,0.97,9452.442,9453.544,"Okay, seeing none.",234,,

1146,0.97,9478.035,9499.189,This is a statement of legislative intent with respect to the parking enforcement officers asking for a report on basically how many resources would be required including Ftes and budget if the parking enforcement officers were expanded.,235,,
1147,0.97,9499.189,9499.723,Questions?,236,,
1148,0.97,9499.723,9500.657,Comments?,236,,
1149,0.97,9500.657,9516.073,"Yeah, just a recognition that if the duties of parking enforcement officers were to be expanded in order for them to fulfill those obligations, we may need to look at a future increase in the number of parking enforcement officers.",237,,
1150,0.97,9516.073,9525.616,So this is just asking for a report from the executive on what those additional resources might be.,237,,

1163,0.97,9590.781,9639.029,"I think that whereas the first item presented was, um, considered the sort of, the Overarching proposal, this is the bow that sort of ties it all up, and, um, just, again, it is, um, part of the necessary package to fulfill all of the, um, all of the actions that we've discussed includes the transfers of Ftes and funds, a date for the work to be done, and combines the Department name with the name included in the 2021 2021 budget to reflect the functions.",241,,

1204,0.97,9840.063,9847.003,I think that was one of the ones you added to the end of the agenda earlier this morning.,254,,
1205,0.97,9847.003,9847.437,You're right.,255,,
1206,0.97,9847.437,9849.172,We had two.,255,,
1207,0.97,9849.172,9852.242,One that was missing on the agenda.,255,,
1208,0.97,9852.242,9852.876,I apologize.,255,,
1209,0.97,9852.876,9861.418,"Before we go to Council member Morales' walk on, does it make sense to keep you on here, Lisa?",255,,
1210,0.97,9861.418,9862.652,That's fine.,256,,
1211,0.97,9862.652,9863.32,Okay.,257,,
1212,0.97,9863.32,9873.93,"The item that was distributed to us, we have this as a, um, official document received on time, but it was just inadvertently left off.",257,,
1213,0.97,9873.93,9880.67,I can imagine how that can happen given the hundreds of amendments we have here.,257,,
1214,0.97,9880.67,9889.779,Thank you for making accommodations so we could hear it today.,257,,
1215,0.97,9889.779,9892.882,Úblg031B01.,257,,
1216,0.97,9892.882,9893.483,Yes.,258,,
1217,0.97,9893.483,9919.476,So this is sponsored by Council member Herbold and would make a slight modification to the ordinance that would create the stand up of separate office of emergency management and lines up the Seattle municipal code language to reflect OEM's current authorities and wouldn't codify any internal policies in an effort to keep the municipal code a little cleaner.,258,,
1218,0.97,9919.476,9920.577,That's pretty much all it does.,258,,
1219,0.97,9920.577,9928.218,"Council member Herbold, anything to add to that?",259,,
1220,0.97,9928.218,9929.686,"Technical, but very important.",260,,
1221,0.97,9929.686,9932.122,"All right, any additional questions on that one?",261,,
1222,0.97,9932.122,9935.325,Seeing no additional questions.,261,,
1223,0.97,9935.325,9938.662,"And at this point, the Council sponsors are the same.",261,,
1224,0.97,9938.662,9940.897,Council members Strauss and Gonzalez.,261,,
1225,0.97,9940.897,9943.133,Thank you so much.,261,,
1226,0.97,9943.133,9944.301,"All right, appreciate it, Lisa.",261,,
1227,0.97,9944.301,9953.543,"Okay, our last item, thank you very much Council member Morales for circulating this item before 5:00 P.M.",261,,
1228,0.97,9953.543,9953.843,Yesterday.,261,,
1229,0.97,9953.843,9966.156,"Council colleagues, you amended the agenda to include this item, and we're going to have central staff explain it and have Council member Morales walk us through it as well.",261,,
1230,0.97,9966.156,9973.363,So this is SPD walk on item amendment number 2.,262,,
1231,0.97,9973.363,9979.135,The first and only SPD walk on amendment.,262,,
1232,0.97,9979.135,9987.544,"It would, um, it's related to many of the items you've seen before today.",262,,
1233,0.97,9987.544,10003.259,It's recognizing that the Participatory budgeting process that's intended to occur next year will require significant resources both on the community side and on the city side to get money out the door.,262,,
1234,0.97,10003.259,10011.601,Community-Based organizations will be in the lead in terms of working with the community to identify projects.,262,,
1235,0.97,10011.601,10027.083,The city and community will need to work together to vet those projects and make sure they're things the city can spend money on.,262,,
1236,0.97,10027.083,10057.514,"And then, the community will again be in a voting process to identify the top priority items that come out of the idea generation process, and then, um, finally the city will need to contract with the organizations or groups that end up having proposals funded through the Participatory budgeting process.",262,,
1237,0.97,10057.514,10072.862,"So this budget action recognizes that funds being cut from the police Department's budget in 2021 will feed into that community Participatory budgeting process, but also realizes there will be funding needed for the process.",262,,
1238,0.97,10072.862,10074.864,"Okay, thank you so much.",263,,
1239,0.97,10074.864,10079.436,"Thanks again, paddy for sharing this screen for folks watching.",263,,
1240,0.97,10079.436,10083.573,Here's a summary of the effect given that this was a late amendment.,263,,
1241,0.97,10083.573,10088.344,We don't have it as an official document to show cosponsors at this point.,263,,
1242,0.97,10088.344,10097.72,"But Council member Morales did meet the requirements for circulating before 5:00 p.m., and it has been amended to be part of our agenda and consideration.",263,,
1243,0.97,10097.72,10107.297,"Council member Morales, would you like to walk us through the proposal as you have outlined in the draft document?",263,,
1244,0.97,10107.297,10107.864,Sure.,264,,
1245,0.97,10107.864,10110.166,"Thanks for your indulgence, everyone.",264,,
1246,0.97,10110.166,10123.813,"As Lish said, this is a Council budget action that would allocate savings for cuts from the police Department and other sources to fund this process.",264,,
1247,0.97,10123.813,10137.427,"Um, this summer we heard from our constituents that they want to see a meaningful Disinvestment in SPD and a meaningful investment in black and Brown communities through a Participatory budget process.",264,,
1248,0.97,10137.427,10147.504,So we began that work by allocating the $3 million to begin preliminary research needed that could help guide the creation of this project.,264,,
1249,0.97,10147.504,10153.109,We all received last week the preliminary report from some of the work that's already begun.,264,,
1250,0.97,10153.109,10168.057,"The intend of this budget action is to establish the infrastructure for the administration of this process it is similar to the your voice, your choice parks and streets program that we already have.",264,,
1251,0.97,10168.057,10200.223,"Similar to that, this is intended to be a regular opportunity for neighbors to weigh in on community safety ideas, and in order for that process to happen, that requires staffing for contracting with community organizations, um, for the Community-Led engagement that's a part of this process for convening and supporting a steering committee to help guide the process, marketing of the initiative.",264,,
1252,0.97,10200.223,10202.759,So all of that is part of the infrastructure needed.,264,,
1253,0.97,10202.759,10214.971,It's sort of how we ensure that this process runs smoothly by offering that kind of back office support to the community organizations out doing the work.,264,,
1254,0.97,10214.971,10228.218,And the memo that was circulated this morning indicated that we had not yet talked to any of the departments that might be involved.,264,,
1255,0.97,10228.218,10233.122,"We will, of course, do that as we continue these conversations.",264,,
1256,0.97,10233.122,10256.512,"But I've had at least one conversation with 2 director at the Department of neighborhoods to get a better understanding of how the your voice, your choice program is work, and he really helped us flush out those administrative pieces that need to be a part of this.",264,,
1257,0.97,10256.512,10294.751,"So we are really excited as the divestment conversations indicated earlier through the the day, this is part of a process, so much of the savings that we hope to accrue through the reductions we're talking about would be housed in general finance, and this is the other end of that work, so I am asking for you're support to follow through on the commitments, and really the intention here is to put in place the administrative size of the work that needs to happen.",264,,
1258,0.97,10294.751,10296.819,Thank you Council member Morales.,265,,
1259,0.97,10296.819,10300.723,I appreciate the explanation there.,265,,
1260,0.97,10300.723,10312.902,The way I understand it in reading this document is that many of the other amendments were suggesting that funding goes to Participatory budgeting.,265,,
1261,0.97,10312.902,10328.117,"This piece here as the other Council member said puts a nice bow on it recognizing that we need Participatory budgeting and administrative dollars up to, but not mandating a million.",265,,
1262,0.97,10328.117,10328.818,Right.,266,,
1263,0.97,10328.818,10332.588,But this creates that infrastructure.,267,,
1264,0.97,10332.588,10333.956,That's right.,268,,
1265,0.97,10333.956,10356.145,"So the idea would be the saves we could accrue needs to be set aside for the organization, but the bulk would go to the actual investments identified through the process to fund the things the community wants to see in terms of community safety ideas.",268,,
1266,0.97,10356.145,10358.214,Wonderful.,269,,
1267,0.97,10358.214,10360.316,Questionsor comments on this item?,269,,
1268,0.97,10360.316,10361.651,Okay.,269,,
1269,0.97,10361.651,10376.065,"And you might have already said this council member Morales, but at least two Ftes to manage it.",269,,
1270,0.97,10376.065,10378.468,That's right.,270,,
1271,0.97,10378.468,10378.835,Okay.,271,,
1272,0.97,10378.835,10384.674,Thank you very much additional questions on this item?,271,,
1273,0.97,10384.674,10386.476,"Council member Pederson, please go ahead.",271,,
1274,0.97,10386.476,10396.986,"Hi, I'm just trying to understand how this Interplays with the $3 million that we had already approved to the legislative Department?",272,,
1275,0.97,10396.986,10424.247,"So the intention with that was to begin the process, and we should all received a preliminary report from the work, so during the earlier budget conversations, we were talking about the need to identify it in the Participatory budget process.",273,,
1276,0.97,10424.247,10432.121,"So right now we're trying to understand what are the language barriers, what are the child care or attendance barriers.",273,,
1277,0.97,10432.121,10447.804,"If, in Covid, this is going to mean that a lot of the community engagement for Participatory, for the process, needs to happen Online, what are the technology needs that our community members have to allow them to participate.",273,,
1278,0.97,10447.804,10488.778,"So the bulk of the work happening now is to get a really good understanding of what the barriers are and begin to support reducing those barriers so when the Participatory budget process itself is ready to roll, we know that there will be, um, a high level of engagement because those barriers will have all, well, I can't commit to all, but so many of those barriers will have been reduced and we have a good understanding of the translation, the technology needs, and all the other pieces that go into that.",273,,
1279,0.97,10488.778,10491.747,"Good question, council member Pederson.",274,,
1280,0.97,10491.747,10492.315,Any additional questions?,274,,
1281,0.97,10492.315,10493.049,Council member Gonzalez?,274,,
1282,0.97,10493.049,10493.749,Just a comment.,275,,
1283,0.97,10493.749,10515.371,"The way I, um, have been thinking about this body of work is that the Participatory budgeting process funding that we, um, committed to over the summer, um, I think it's Mislabeled a little bit.",275,,
1284,0.97,10515.371,10521.11,"It's not the actual money for, um, investments in community.",275,,
1285,0.97,10521.11,10540.83,"It is really designed to, um, provide deep meaningful substantive, and, you know really in depth Scoping of a project of this size.",275,,
1286,0.97,10540.83,10555.545,"So talking about Participatory budgeting in the true sense of Participatory budgeting in the scale we're talking about, I think it's accurate to say that the city has not engaged in that kind of Participatory budgeting process.",275,,
1287,0.97,10555.545,10609.966,"Yes, we have your vote, your choice, but I would say the scale of that program and the scale of potential investments that are produced from that program are much smaller than what we're envisioning in this space, so what does it take to move it to the scale we're describing is something that requires significant Scoping and design of that program to feel like it's going to be a legitimate process that's Community-Led, Community-Driven, and will be responsible in terms of helping us as decision makers lead some of the investment decisions of community taxpayer dollars towards investments in community safety programs.",275,,
1288,0.97,10609.966,10649.638,"And so the $3 million we invested in this summer, in my mind are really designed for that Scoping piece of Participatory budgeting that needs to happen in a deep, meaningful way through community engagement and research before we can get to the part of what are the dollars, how will the decisions be implemented, and what are the investments going to be, and what does that process, how do we actually unfold the process that was scoped over the summer through the summer funding.",275,,
1289,0.97,10649.638,10665.221,"I see these dollars as that, that implementation piece of now we have the scope of the project and we understand what the Participatory budget process will be, and now we need to administer it.",275,,
1290,0.97,10665.221,10684.874,These in my mind are investments to administer the Participatory budgeting process and some of the other Council budget actions we proposed are the actual dollars thus far going to be available for potential invest.,275,,
1291,0.97,10684.874,10697.386,"I think I have captured, sort of threaded the needle in the best way that I can in terms of how I understand it, but if I misstated anything, you're welcome to correct me.",275,,
1292,0.97,10697.386,10704.393,But that's sort of my best attempt on sort of describing the arc of what we're trying to accomplish here through these various investments.,275,,
1293,0.97,10704.393,10705.528,"Thank you, chair.",275,,
1294,0.97,10713.102,10713.936,Well said.,276,,
1295,0.97,10713.936,10716.172,"Council member Herbold, please go ahead.",276,,
1296,0.97,10716.172,10731.72,"Just to add a little texture to Council member Gonzalez's Fantasti explanation, just so you can imagine what we mean when we talk about the infrastructure, and this is just one piece of it.",277,,
1297,0.97,10731.72,10758.481,"This is like the, again, the human investment, there are seven community organizations and 100 researchers who are working to engage in local and Digital community events right now to inform the findings of what we've received as the initial recommendations.",277,,
1298,0.97,10758.481,10787.143,"Researchers are primarily people, primarily people of color and focusing on surveying people from many racial, ethnic, and linguistic communities using a variety of methodology including, um, art space methodology like photo voice, Digital story telling, story mapping, message testing, Archive research, and more.",277,,
1299,0.97,10787.143,10794.15,That's just a little bit about the human labor involved in this project.,277,,
1300,0.97,10794.15,10806.162,"There's also, um, the investment that we need to make in people to engage with the research project.",277,,
1301,0.97,10806.162,10821.01,"Those are barriers that impact people's ability to spend their time, and this is something I think we really take for granted I think as professional meeting Goers like we are.",277,,
1302,0.97,10821.01,10838.494,"It is difficult for people to often spend the time necessary to do this sort of engagement, and so part of this effort is about removing the barriers that make it difficult to do the engagement.",277,,
1303,0.97,10838.494,10842.965,"Just, if I might, chair.",278,,
1304,0.97,10842.965,10847.136,"Thank you both, Council president and Council member Herbold.",278,,
1305,0.97,10847.136,10853.943,"I think this is, um, a fairly new process for us.",278,,
1306,0.97,10853.943,10882.404,"As a city, we're not used to trusting our community to do this kind of work, and I think it is critical that we allow for this much more robust, um, research and data gathering process, and to allow for the creativity of our community members who know, um, were different ways to gather the kind of information that we need in order to to be good policy makers.",278,,
1307,0.97,10882.404,10895.184,"You know, this really speaks to some of the conversation that we had last week when we were discussing that memo about racial equity.",278,,
1308,0.97,10895.184,10929.118,"And the ways in which, as a municipality, we need to allow for, particularly communities of color, to engage in processes that, um, that reduce barriers and allow them to participate in ways that are meaningful and sort of get out of the way of our community telling us the way they want the community to be and want their tax dollars spent.",278,,
1309,0.97,10929.118,10929.652,I'm excited about this.,278,,
1310,0.97,10929.652,10939.929,This is a different scale Han that we've done before.,278,,
1311,0.97,10939.929,10952.174,"And we are hoping to have significantly more money for our neighbors to help make decisions and guide, um, after they go through this process and identify the projects they want to see.",278,,
1312,0.97,10952.174,10961.25,"The last thing I'll say is part of the reason that the city gets involved, and when I spoke to the director, they have a relatively small program.",278,,
1313,0.97,10961.25,10982.171,"They have one FTE who is something who coordinates within the Department, but also does coordination across departments, and it's city staff who once the community has identified the kind of things they want to see, it's the city staff who come in and help put some meet on the bones, if you will.",278,,
1314,0.97,10982.171,11006.462,"Help identify what is the scope of the project, how much would something like this cost, what are the outcomes this could have for the community, so this is an opportunity for us to try something new.",278,,
1315,0.97,11006.462,11016.038,"Give over on autonomy, frankly, to our community, and let them have the resources they need.",278,,
1316,0.97,11016.038,11045.234,"I feel like I talk about this all the time, but we need to Democratizing, giving our community the resources they need to do the work they want to see and then listen, for us to listen to the choices they've made and give some of the power they need back to them.",278,,
1317,0.97,11045.234,11053.208,"So I'm hoping to have your support, and I'm eager for us to begin this process.",278,,
1318,0.97,11053.208,11056.211,"Okay, well, thank you very much.",279,,
1319,0.97,11056.211,11059.548,You do have some cosponsors on this.,279,,
1320,0.97,11059.548,11063.752,I'll summarize so we can record this.,279,,
1321,0.97,11063.752,11067.656,"Council members Herbold, Strauss, and president Gonzalez are our cosponsors on the item.",279,,
1322,0.97,11067.656,11074.363,Thank you for walking this on and meeting the deadlines.,279,,
1323,0.97,11074.363,11076.098,We are done.,279,,
1324,0.97,11076.098,11076.398,I believe.,279,,
1325,0.97,11076.398,11077.332,Am I right?,279,,
1326,0.97,11077.332,11078.567,I'm done.,280,,
1327,0.97,11078.567,11079.768,Thank you.,280,,
1328,0.97,11079.768,11082.671,"Okay, excellent.",281,,
1329,0.97,11082.671,11086.875,"Aly, anything else to add from your perspective?",281,,
1330,0.97,11086.875,11088.076,"No, I think we're done.",282,,
1331,0.97,11088.076,11088.51,All right!,283,,
1332,0.97,11088.51,11093.482,"So colleagues, we've reached the end of the agenda.",283,,
1333,0.97,11093.482,11097.186,The next meeting will be November 10th at 9:30.,283,,
1334,0.97,11097.186,11099.288,We'll be taking public comment again.,283,,
1335,0.97,11099.288,11100.956,Sign Upstarts two hours beforehand.,283,,
1336,0.97,11100.956,11112.0,"In the meantime, we'll summarize all the conversations we've heard both from public testimony, the discussions in open with our colleagues here about the various proposals.",283,,
1337,0.97,11112.0,11116.104,We'll synthesize the information you have.,283,,
