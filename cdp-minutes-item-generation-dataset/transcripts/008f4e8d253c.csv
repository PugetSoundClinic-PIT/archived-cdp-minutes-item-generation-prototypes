72,0.97,477.243,482.682,And the hope is that this policy is just the beginning of ways the city another light.,10,,

90,0.97,572.471,572.972,A crisis.,13,,
91,0.97,572.972,582.048,There is no reason a city like this the values social justice like this one is could not have more opportunities for affordable housing for its residents.,13,,
92,0.97,582.048,597.296,I have witnessed these Nnecessary Sweeps on Ho Encampments that do little if anything to help the members of the community experience homelessness especially for those who have no home because of the lack of affordable housing.,13,,
93,0.97,597.296,622.455,I feel like it is more of a method of displacement and violence against people trying to survive in our city and I urge the Council and committee to address homelessness in our city but to consider counsel bill 120081 and other bills like at that address the crisis that impact one of the most marginalized and overlooked communities in our city and allows for more diverse housing options that encourage Affordability.,13,,
94,0.97,622.455,625.791,Thank you so much.,13,,

115,0.97,748.013,748.547,Thank you.,24,,
116,0.97,748.547,755.821,We were first briefing two weeks ago and Committee before the bill was introduced.,24,,
117,0.97,755.821,766.165,We discussed and then receive an appeal to the state environmental policy act analysis of the legislation which means the policy cannot get action until the repeal is vault resolved.,24,,
118,0.97,766.165,772.471,"While we are proceeding today, we will not be able to vote in the near future.",24,,
119,0.97,772.471,784.884,"While the appeal works its way through the process, Councilmember Juarez and I have introduced counsel bill 120080 which would extend the moratorium on the redevelopment of manufactured home parks.",24,,
120,0.97,784.884,792.191,This ensures that our manufactured home parks are preserved slowly move forward with a long-term legislation.,24,,
121,0.97,792.191,799.798,"It will be a public hearing on the moratorium extension of the full city council meeting next Tuesday, June 1ST starting at 2:00 P.M.",24,,
122,0.97,799.798,812.011,"We will have a vote on the moratorium extension at the city council meeting on Monday, June 7. we have Kido Freeman.",24,,
123,0.97,812.011,818.951,Can you provide us with a brief overview?,24,,
124,0.97,818.951,827.226,I will briefly walk through the presentation from last week.,25,,
125,0.97,827.226,833.933,I think Mr. Sinai is probably familiar with the legislation.,25,,
126,0.97,833.933,844.043,But in the end is--I wore mine with the bill does on the viewing public briefly.,25,,
127,0.97,844.043,864.363,"As Councilmembers will recall, the committee is considering a bill or will in the future consider a potential bill that would establish a mobile home park overlay district that will protect the city's remaining mobile home parks.",26,,
128,0.97,864.363,865.798,And a little bit of legislative history.,26,,
129,0.97,865.798,883.582,"In January of 2019, the council passed an ordinance 125764 that established a one-year moratorium on the redevelopment of mobile home parks and a work program for the executive to propose permanent regulations to protect mobile home parks.",26,,
130,0.97,883.582,888.387,The moratorium has been extended three times for additional six month periods.,26,,
131,0.97,888.387,891.89,Councilmember Strauss mentioned there will be a fourth extension in early June.,26,,
132,0.97,891.89,902.801,The city did publish or the Council published a threshold determination in April and it has been appealed in the near term.,26,,
133,0.97,902.801,908.374,"A little bit on background and regulatory context, as I mentioned, there two remaining mobile home parks.",26,,
134,0.97,908.374,916.448,They are both located in the urban village and comprised of 11 acres in total.,26,,
135,0.97,916.448,920.719,Develop Ministry .8 acres.,26,,
136,0.97,920.719,929.428,The House is about twice as large.,26,,
137,0.97,929.428,930.929,There is confusion about zoning for the site.,26,,
138,0.97,930.929,935.1,Some of the Online maps are incorrect.,26,,
139,0.97,935.1,942.608,The Council did of zone both of these sites through the Mha ordinance a few years ago.,26,,
140,0.97,942.608,943.942,The prior zoning designation was C140.,26,,
141,0.97,943.942,970.536,The sites or zones C155 resulted from an error in the Council and sort of a slip between a committee decision on Mha and what happened at full Council and the maps that the full council voted on and did not reflect the committee recommendation to keep the zoning at the T140.,26,,
142,0.97,970.536,982.681,Seattle is not alone in addressing or seeking to address the issue of preserving market rate affordable housing present in mobile home parks.,26,,
143,0.97,982.681,988.12,"In 2008, Tumwater passed a bill that applies to six of the 10 mobile home parks that Tumwater.",26,,
144,0.97,988.12,998.597,"Most recently, Kenmore passed a set of regulations that applied to some mobile home parks in that city and I believe that legislation has been appealed for the growth management hearings board.",26,,
145,0.97,998.597,1007.973,"The proposed overlay district, to Demystify some jargon, and overlay district is a set of regulations that lay over the underlying zoning.",26,,
146,0.97,1007.973,1024.123,"There are many of these in the city of Seattle, there are many familiar with is the shoreline overlay district that Overlays the city's shorelines and that complements the shoreline management act for the state.",26,,
147,0.97,1024.123,1043.842,The proposed overlay district will limit used to mobile homes in mobile home parks and establish minimum and maximum entities and allows some commercial use for the size of those and establish imitations consistent with ongoing use of mobile home parks as residential uses and requires some residential amenities when parks are Redeveloped and would expire.,26,,
148,0.97,1043.842,1057.756,The slide here says up within 50 years of the legislation introduced with an expiration.,26,,
149,0.97,1057.756,1067.032,"Next steps as Council member Strauss mentioned, there is the appeal which means counsel cannot act on the legislation until the appeal is resolved.",26,,
150,0.97,1067.032,1076.275,Table that would extend the moratorium for an additional six months is scheduled for a public hearing on this coming Tuesday in June.,26,,
151,0.97,1076.275,1082.681,And the potential full counsel vote the following Monday.,26,,
152,0.97,1082.681,1087.92,And so that is all for the Recap Councilmember Strauss.,26,,
153,0.97,1087.92,1089.221,"Mr. Freeman, that was very helpful.",27,,
154,0.97,1089.221,1099.364,"Colleagues, I know that we have had public hearings on this moratorium extension every six months for the last two plus years.",27,,
155,0.97,1099.364,1107.172,"In the interest of time, I will be asking clarifying questions.",27,,
156,0.97,1107.172,1128.126,"Anyone watching that would like more information, please do referred to our legislative agenda which takes you to the age that has much more information and we went into a more deep presentation and headed on a deeper level at the last meeting.",27,,
157,0.97,1128.126,1133.198,"Colleagues, any other questions for Mr. Freeman at this time quick seeing nine, I would like to move us into the public hearing.",27,,
158,0.97,1133.198,1158.724,"And before we open the remote public hearing, I would again ask that everyone please be patient as we continue to learn to operate the new system in Realtime and navigate through the inevitable growing pains as we are continuously looking for ways to fine tune the process and add new features that allow for a look at public participation in Council meetings.",27,,
159,0.97,1158.724,1160.125,And moderate in the following manner.,27,,
160,0.97,1160.125,1161.76,Each Speaker will be given two minutes to speak.,27,,
161,0.97,1161.76,1166.465,I will call on one Speaker at a time and in the order in which they registered on the Council Website.,27,,
162,0.97,1166.465,1173.872,"If you have not yet registered to speak and would like to, you can sign up for the public hearing by going to the Council Website on Seattle.Gov/Counsel.",27,,
163,0.97,1173.872,1184.049,This is also listed on today's agenda and is different from the listen line option.,27,,
164,0.97,1184.049,1195.093,"When I call on a Speaker's name, staff will on meat the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt will be the Speaker Cue that it is your turn to speak.",27,,
165,0.97,1195.093,1197.896,Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item you are addressing.,27,,
166,0.97,1197.896,1202.501,"As a reminder, public comments should relate to counsel bill 120079.",27,,

188,0.97,1291.957,1305.804,"The Seattle city council land use committee members, my name is Yakoff Sinai and I have probably owned a mobile home Park for over 40 years.",33,,
189,0.97,1305.804,1315.714,The preservation of this type of housing for residents like mine is important.,33,,
190,0.97,1315.714,1324.222,There are so few mobile home parks left and my homeowners are Hard-Working and many are low income.,33,,
191,0.97,1324.222,1328.36,These homes are a stable and affordable place for them to live.,33,,
192,0.97,1328.36,1333.632,I have said this in my prior testimony before the Council.,33,,
193,0.97,1333.632,1341.139,I want to be clear again that I have no intention of Redeveloping this.,33,,
194,0.97,1341.139,1345.911,Into any other use then it is now.,33,,
195,0.97,1345.911,1377.576,"A place that serves the current residents and provides them with affordable homes and to operate the land for the long term, I suggest that you change it to the current legislation that will allow me the flexibility needed over time to take care of the property and make modest changes without Overburdening the property.",33,,
196,0.97,1377.576,1384.049,The legislation changes that would help include.,33,,
197,0.97,1384.049,1391.957,Not including the limits on the number of homes on the property.,33,,
198,0.97,1392.09,1401.867,Which would restrict adding new owners in the future or Reconfiguring the site.,33,,
199,0.97,1401.867,1419.518,"Adding setbacks when new homes are added, the amount of land we are able to use for owners over time.",33,,
200,0.97,1419.518,1420.819,And the expense of low income owners.,33,,
201,0.97,1420.819,1428.994,The requirement to add open space to add or change are more than 30% of the total homes.,33,,
202,0.97,1428.994,1433.465,And the same amount of land we add to manufacture homes.,33,,
203,0.97,1433.465,1442.007,Weare not--for future open space and greatly impact.,33,,
204,0.97,1442.007,1444.409,"Excuse me, Yakoff.",34,,

207,0.97,1468.767,1472.771,You have two minutes.,36,,
208,0.97,1472.771,1482.614,"If you do not wrap up at the end of your two minutes, your microphone will be muted after 10 seconds.",36,,

210,0.97,1483.515,1483.815,Hello.,37,,
211,0.97,1483.815,1484.249,Good morning.,38,,
212,0.97,1484.249,1484.749,Can you hear me?,39,,
213,0.97,1484.749,1485.083,We can.,40,,
214,0.97,1485.083,1486.051,Good.,41,,
215,0.97,1486.051,1486.551,Thank you.,41,,
216,0.97,1486.551,1499.431,"I just want to say that I do think that, as Yakoff said, it is something that needs to be addressed.",41,,
217,0.97,1499.431,1503.602,So to have new setback requirements would really disturb the whole arrangement there.,41,,
218,0.97,1503.602,1506.905,I just wanted to say that.,41,,
219,0.97,1506.905,1513.111,So I hope you can find a solution to that that works for them.,41,,
220,0.97,1513.111,1524.589,"So with that said, I speak in favor of the land use to protect us from the development that would cause the park to close.",41,,
221,0.97,1524.589,1532.53,And I want to specifically address some of the points in the paper by the lawyer regarding the Cepa.,41,,
222,0.97,1532.53,1541.006,And the first is--it may not seem like the most important to you.,41,,
223,0.97,1541.006,1555.12,"But to me, reading it, there was a comment in there that was sort of like, if we close the park and kick these people out, we will give them an opportunity to buy into a new apartment.",41,,
224,0.97,1555.12,1570.001,And that is just such a slap in the face to those of us who are here because we do not have the financial resources to do those things.,41,,
225,0.97,1570.001,1571.469,That is how can we live here.,41,,
226,0.97,1571.469,1581.346,And we also live here because we enjoy being in a place where we are not just Side-By-Side in a little box.,41,,
227,0.97,1581.346,1583.582,We have more of a real life in a mobile home.,41,,
228,0.97,1583.582,1586.184,So I just wanted to make that point.,41,,
229,0.97,1586.184,1595.594,"And then, there is another point that I wanted to make.",41,,
230,0.97,1595.594,1601.766,I did send in comments in writing.,41,,
231,0.97,1601.766,1602.801,I think that is it.,41,,
232,0.97,1602.801,1603.234,Is that my time?,41,,
233,0.97,1603.234,1613.645,Five seconds left.,42,,
234,0.97,1614.412,1620.518,Please address any errors in the Cepa.,43,,
235,0.97,1620.518,1631.196,The thing about zoning is there is a difference between them.,43,,
236,0.97,1631.196,1632.23,That needs to be resolved.,43,,
237,0.97,1632.23,1633.098,Those are my comments.,43,,
238,0.97,1633.098,1639.904,Thank you for your work on this.,43,,

273,0.97,1878.376,1880.545,"Because of that, he has designed several history tours for the PDA.",55,,
274,0.97,1880.545,1889.254,Also virtual history walking tour of the market through history language is a great organization whose offices reside in our market as well.,55,,

286,0.97,1944.242,1948.112,What is interesting over the years since I have talked to Nick is that he understands the market.,56,,
287,0.97,1948.112,1952.85,Not only as history and community but also an economic engine for the city.,56,,
288,0.97,1952.85,1964.128,And as we go through Covid-19 recovery and how important it is will work together to be able to get the market to the other side of this.,56,,
289,0.97,1964.128,1967.665,"And at this time, especially with the 50th anniversary of saving the market.",56,,
290,0.97,1967.665,1985.283,"And associate at this time, it is very important that people in the Council and community put the energies toward that to get us through this and work with downtown also to get us through this and to the other side.",56,,
291,0.97,1985.283,1985.983,Excellent.,57,,
292,0.97,1985.983,1988.753,"Thank you, Colleen and Mary.",57,,

296,0.97,1999.063,2000.865,You did a pretty good job of summing it up.,58,,
297,0.97,2000.865,2006.17,"As Colleen mentioned, I have been serving with the Pike place market constituency for number of years now.",58,,
298,0.97,2006.17,2016.013,And I have run previously for this PDA appointee seat here.,58,,

303,0.97,2034.766,2040.438,Sure.,60,,
304,0.97,2040.438,2041.239,Would see.,60,,
305,0.97,2041.239,2053.518,My favorite one--and this might be a bit personal but my favorite one is that we have got potentially the oldest public Restrooms on the entire West Coast right below Pike place fish.,60,,
306,0.97,2053.518,2057.822,"At very least, the longest Consecutively used ones that have been in use since 1909.",60,,
307,0.97,2057.822,2062.059,Let's see.,60,,
308,0.97,2062.059,2062.927,There is so much.,60,,
309,0.97,2062.927,2091.389,"One of my favorite things I was doing the tours was having those Disney moments of the market community finding ways to help each other out and to overcome their own adversity, whether it is the story of the anonymous $1000 donation and that was put forward and paying it forward into the business model today.",60,,
310,0.97,2091.389,2113.711,Or if it's being Privy to and sitting in on the decision of the former employees at Pike place fish working with the then owner of the company to take it over and bring those sort of market ideals of community even further.,60,,
311,0.97,2113.711,2120.518,There is so much.,60,,
312,0.97,2120.518,2131.929,"And if counsel people would like to come and take a tour with me, I would be happy to show you around the market and try to Cram it into as short of a time as I can.",60,,
313,0.97,2131.929,2133.097,But I can go pretty long about it.,60,,
314,0.97,2133.097,2136.334,I would love to take you up on it.,61,,
315,0.97,2136.334,2141.339,I know I will show you my tile at the market and hopefully you will include that in your tour.,61,,
316,0.97,2141.339,2145.943,I will show you my charm on the Newmarket front fence.,62,,
317,0.97,2145.943,2146.744,There we are.,63,,
318,0.97,2146.744,2147.245,Thank you.,63,,
319,0.97,2147.245,2154.986,"And Hannah, anything else you would like to round out with this before we end the conversation?",63,,
320,0.97,2154.986,2168.933,Not much to add . clearly there is a lot of passion here for the market which is so important to all of us in Seattle and especially in the recovery.,64,,
321,0.97,2168.933,2171.435,Thanks to everyone for your patience with me and coming through the paperwork.,64,,
322,0.97,2171.435,2174.272,It was a long process.,64,,
323,0.97,2174.272,2175.139,Nothing to add there.,64,,
324,0.97,2175.139,2179.21,But happy to bring forward the market for the first term.,64,,
325,0.97,2179.21,2180.077,One more thing.,65,,
326,0.97,2180.077,2200.565,"I want to thank Hannah, if we did not, she takes our calls all the time for number of reasons and is always really great at helping us to the process and I want to thank Councilmember Lewis because he is doing the same thing especially through Lewis, taking our calls and trying to navigate.",65,,
327,0.97,2200.565,2205.436,"If I missed the two of them, I wanted to say thank you.",65,,
328,0.97,2205.436,2214.178,"From our discussion with Councilmember Lewis, I'm sorry but I'm reminded of a number of questions from the last meeting.",66,,
329,0.97,2214.178,2219.984,I know I was steering us in the direction to wrap up but I have a couple of questions I would like to put on the record.,66,,
330,0.97,2219.984,2220.818,I already know the answers.,66,,
331,0.97,2220.818,2233.998,But can you remind me of anything in the rules and regulations of the PDA called for your constituency to hold an election for the seat and the background regarding that in this situation?,66,,
332,0.97,2233.998,2238.502,"I can take that if you would like, Mary.",67,,
333,0.97,2238.502,2241.939,The policies for the PDA and the constituency are the same.,67,,
334,0.97,2241.939,2245.61,The constituency is an organ of the PDA and they are very clear for filling vacancies.,67,,
335,0.97,2245.61,2247.712,It is not supposed to be handled by a live election.,67,,
336,0.97,2247.712,2254.352,It is supposed to be handled by a vote and a membership present which did not happen.,67,,
337,0.97,2254.352,2259.423,"When a two-month clock is up on that, it is incumbent on the PDA to elect someone to the seat.",67,,
338,0.97,2259.423,2265.997,What we simply did was take the process and picked it up where it left off with the nominees identified until we finished the process.,67,,
339,0.97,2265.997,2274.038,Were there opportunities or was it in person only?,68,,
340,0.97,2274.038,2279.577,"If the two month period is up, our policy is that the PDA Council itself relax.",69,,
341,0.97,2279.577,2284.148,It is a remote meeting where we heard public comments but the Councilmembers actually the ones that vote.,69,,
342,0.97,2284.148,2284.682,Okay.,70,,
343,0.97,2284.682,2289.02,So the rules require in person but was told remotely?,70,,
344,0.97,2289.02,2298.896,"The rules for the constituency, have they filled the seat with a two months, were to have a remote meeting with new membership present.",71,,
345,0.97,2298.896,2306.404,"On the clock is up, the role becomes that is incumbent on the PDA Council to make a vote and decision on that.",71,,
346,0.97,2306.404,2307.605,So it is two different processes.,71,,
347,0.97,2307.605,2310.841,It can get confusing.,71,,
348,0.97,2310.841,2314.679,"So can you remind me, has Nick begun already Servingas of now?",72,,
349,0.97,2314.679,2315.012,Yes.,73,,
350,0.97,2315.012,2320.818,We checked with Hannah.,73,,
351,0.97,2320.818,2326.757,The appointees start surveying until and unless we hear differently from your body or the Mayor's office.,73,,
352,0.97,2326.757,2334.598,"Councilmember Lewis, is there anything else you would like to add about the process that it has brought us to today?",74,,
353,0.97,2334.598,2335.833,No Mr. chair.,75,,
354,0.97,2335.833,2337.201,I think that covered it well.,75,,
355,0.97,2337.201,2350.448,"I do just want to say that in this era of Covid-19 and having to work remotely, it has led to a lot of adaptations that we have had to make.",75,,
356,0.97,2350.448,2354.618,We are sitting here at a virtual meeting conducting city business out of that horrible necessity.,75,,
357,0.97,2354.618,2391.155,And I think that this has been another one of those awkward Workarounds or we have to deal with the rules and deal with the situation that Covid-19 has dealt us to still conduct the people's business in a way that is in keeping with public health goals and in a way that is making sure everyone can participate and feel safe and in a way where we are not asking someone to balance their public health versus participation in democracy.,75,,
358,0.97,2391.155,2404.201,And that is required making some adaptations in how we conduct business on this is just another example of that.,75,,
359,0.97,2404.201,2414.411,I want to say it is clear from the analysis that PDA didn't follow the rules the way they have to be implement to during this time.,75,,
360,0.97,2414.411,2420.184,And I'm sure all of us look forward to being able to conduct business.,75,,
361,0.97,2420.184,2427.358,But I do appreciate putting on the record that this was another one of those Covid-19 era anomalies.,75,,
362,0.97,2427.358,2436.333,"When Nick comes back for Reconfirmation, it will probably be along the lines of what we are historically used you.",75,,
363,0.97,2436.333,2436.934,Well said.,76,,
364,0.97,2436.934,2439.403,Thank you Councilmember Lewis and thank you for the additional background.,76,,
365,0.97,2439.403,2442.44,Any further comments?,76,,
366,0.97,2442.44,2449.313,"Seeing none, we can vote on this.",76,,
367,0.97,2449.313,2470.734,I didn't want to put these comments in response to the last question but I wanted to give a brief shout out to the Pike place market community that has been really resilient during this very difficult time.,77,,
368,0.97,2470.734,2507.204,"Pike place market has sort of been this resilient Readout in the middle of the downtown neighborhood and has really helped to maintain a really important source of grocery for the neighborhood that has maintained a cultural center of restaurants and gathering spaces, even during the Covid- 19 crisis that has not just helped the unique Ecosystem and community sustain itself but also has been very helpful to a neighborhood that has experienced a lot of hardship over the course of Covid-19.",77,,
369,0.97,2507.204,2512.776,And that is no small part of the folks present today.,77,,
370,0.97,2512.776,2517.915,The leadership of Mary and Colleen and Nick.,77,,
371,0.97,2517.915,2531.428,"And also due to the countless vendors, residents and the people and the artists and the people that have really made Pike place market this unique example of place making in the city of Seattle.",77,,
372,0.97,2531.428,2541.238,"And in a practical sense, we are only here to confirm Nick today.",77,,
373,0.97,2541.238,2557.021,"But in a broader sense, I do like that we have all taken a few moments to recognize, as it looks like we are coming out on the other side of this, what the market has been through and how the market has survived and thrived and will come back even better hopefully on the other side of this going into recovery.",77,,
374,0.97,2557.021,2561.325,And history could have been different.,77,,
375,0.97,2561.325,2572.336,"But the leadership of the people here have really made it so that we can hang on, adapt and get to the crisis.",77,,
376,0.97,2572.336,2581.579,"And at the beginning of this, I remember that Mary told me, we were in your office and you are just beside ourselves.",77,,
377,0.97,2581.579,2587.751,"It was at the beginning of the Senate was looking very Graham and/or Marie saying, when this is all over come we should have a big party.",77,,
378,0.97,2587.751,2591.689,A big party here at the market.,77,,
379,0.97,2591.689,2599.496,"And is there going forward, if you want to program the big party, I feel like we can almost start planning now.",77,,
380,0.97,2599.496,2600.197,Fingers crossed.,77,,
381,0.97,2600.197,2600.898,We are getting close.,77,,
382,0.97,2600.898,2602.199,That I agree with that sentiment.,77,,
383,0.97,2602.199,2610.107,So thank you so much and I look forward to confirming Nick in a few seconds.,77,,
384,0.97,2610.107,2616.013,"As long as mud honey place on top of the market roof again, I am in.",78,,
385,0.97,2616.013,2622.453,"With that said, unless there is further discussion, colleagues, we can now vote on this appointment.",78,,
386,0.97,2622.453,2628.826,"Seeing none, have moved the committee recommended confirmation of the appointment 091 Visa--0917.",78,,
387,0.97,2628.826,2629.059,Second.,78,,

409,0.97,2703.167,2704.401,We will wait until it goes.,90,,
410,0.97,2704.401,2706.07,We are very excited for this piece of legislation.,90,,
411,0.97,2706.07,2709.44,It has been long-awaited to have this before our committee.,90,,
412,0.97,2709.44,2724.221,It was part of the package with Burger bar place in the central area senior center because of a couple of refinements that needed to be made.,90,,
413,0.97,2724.221,2725.389,That package was split out.,90,,
414,0.97,2725.389,2730.127,And so we had these pieces of legislation before us.,90,,
415,0.97,2730.127,2732.696,The same type of package before us already this year.,90,,
416,0.97,2732.696,2738.702,This legislation was part of the package and was split out to make sure everything would move forward as fast as possible.,90,,
417,0.97,2738.702,2746.91,And so this has been a long- awaited piece of legislation and we are very excited to have it before the committee today.,90,,
418,0.97,2746.91,2752.149,"I know Councilmember Pedersen, we had spoken about possibly having this for two meetings.",90,,
419,0.97,2752.149,2754.318,I am Unfortunately going to need to move this today.,90,,
420,0.97,2754.318,2765.229,We are not able to typically--typically like to have two meetings for pieces of policy.,90,,
421,0.97,2765.229,2792.089,"Because this has been long- awaited and because this was part of a package that we have already discussed and voted on at City Council with the Finance and housing committee and it full counsel and because it is part of the package that we have already heard, and the meetng desire to stay on the Timeline for Phinney neighborhood Association to be able to start activating the space in really important ways for the community, we are going to move forward today.",90,,
422,0.97,2792.089,2802.733,So apologies for any miscommunication on my behalf there or for the assumption that there would be no amendments.,90,,
423,0.97,2802.733,2806.503,That is an assumption that I made as the chair.,90,,
424,0.97,2806.503,2812.709,So we will be engaging in the exception to my rule which is to have this in one committee today.,90,,
425,0.97,2812.709,2826.29,"Before we begin, I would like to make sure to recognize the people who are here with us today.",90,,

447,0.97,2956.386,2962.259,So the Pna mission--we will give a quick overview.,95,,
448,0.97,2962.259,2964.961,A little more than the standard Association.,95,,
449,0.97,2964.961,2976.239,"The Pna mission is to build, engage and support our diverse communities through programs, services and activities that connect neighbors and fosters civic engagement.",95,,
450,0.97,2976.239,2984.348,So we do have about 25 members of the Pna as well as any additional members of the senior center.,95,,
451,0.97,2984.348,2989.486,There is some overlap.,95,,
452,0.97,2989.486,2992.456,We also served the community and a lot of really unique ways.,95,,
453,0.97,2992.456,2993.657,Where we connected and bringing people together.,95,,
454,0.97,2993.657,2995.525,We had the quarterly newspaper.,95,,
455,0.97,2995.525,2997.361,I know I look forward to it every time.,95,,
456,0.97,2997.361,3000.697,"It goes out to about 20,000 households.",95,,
457,0.97,3000.697,3009.706,We have the popular Phinney Blog that we maintain as part of the support network to local small businesses.,95,,
458,0.97,3009.706,3014.611,"We have room rentals providing affordable space and subsidized space for child care, education, fitness, music and ever meetings.",95,,
459,0.97,3014.611,3034.097,"The Phinney center site where I am looking at now, the lobby in the front desk is open for space for the community to be and gather as well as connections to resources and information in the community.",95,,
460,0.97,3034.097,3044.741,We have hundreds of families that utilize our licensed Childcare and preschool as well as participate in one of our three Co-op Preschools.,95,,

465,0.97,3077.774,3085.148,"Again, all of that to highlight that we are more than what a lot of people think of as an Association.",95,,
466,0.97,3085.148,3092.756,And a big part of our work is at the Greenwood senior center.,95,,
467,0.97,3092.756,3096.693,"The Greenwood senior center is an inclusive community that provides social, physical and Emotonal activities focused around the needs of older adults.",95,,
468,0.97,3096.693,3113.61,"We work to fight isolation, build camaraderie and enrich each other's lives and if you unique things we do at the Sender is host and operate a memory loss program.",95,,
469,0.97,3113.61,3119.015,And we are part of the whole region.,95,,

471,0.97,3137.033,3141.438,And we offer support groups and counseling for seniors and the village.,95,,
472,0.97,3141.438,3154.518,In the village program allows seniors to age in place and stay in their homes and communities utilizing the help of volunteers for basic chores and other help.,95,,
473,0.97,3154.518,3161.024,Many seniors are--they have been in the neighborhood for decades.,95,,
474,0.97,3161.024,3169.966,We purchased a modest home and have priced out of the ability to move anywhere else like many people in Seattle.,95,,
475,0.97,3169.966,3189.052,"So the senior center and being able to continue to support that community is really crucial, as well as, as I mentioned, more seniors becoming seniors and the community growing and changing and the needs of the community growing and changing.",95,,
476,0.97,3189.052,3193.99,So this transfer allows us to do that now and in the future.,95,,
477,0.97,3193.99,3204.701,"The last thing I will say is that our plan is, when this is all finalized, is to conduct Becoe brands of needs assessment.",95,,
478,0.97,3204.701,3220.684,It has been a while since we have done that so we can truly understand what we need the space to be for the community that will complement some existing sites and feasibility studies about possible use of the site which will also be updated.,95,,
479,0.97,3220.684,3222.552,So thank you for the opportunity to provide the overview.,95,,

493,0.97,3303.466,3320.483,For the mutual and offsetting benefit buildings into the hands of community as the core principle of the community wealth building work which is supported by the departments involved and highlighted by the Mayor as well.,99,,
494,0.97,3320.483,3325.922,And a little bit of context.,99,,
495,0.97,3325.922,3328.491,"At the start of the process, their worst six mutual offsetting benefit buildings.",99,,
496,0.97,3328.491,3342.739,"The three we are now, hopefully with the transfer of the Greenwood senior center would include the central area senior center which was finalized in late 2020.",99,,
497,0.97,3342.739,3347.444,And Brett Barr place which was also finalized and transferred in 2020 and then the Greenwood senior center.,99,,
498,0.97,3347.444,3363.66,"And to note, I know there is great interest from counsel about the work happening at the South Park neighborhood center and that is still ongoing as we were to build additional capacity for the community organizations for future and eventual ownership as well.",99,,
499,0.97,3363.66,3369.799,I will turn it over to my colleague to take us to the next slide.,99,,
500,0.97,3369.799,3371.167,Thank you and thank you Councilmember Strauss.,100,,
501,0.97,3371.167,3374.771,I'm also really excited about this legislation finally getting to counsel.,100,,
502,0.97,3374.771,3393.556,"My involvement actually goes back a little further to the late 2016, early 2017 arrow when a smaller interdepartmental team was working to establish organizational readiness criteria for these 3Mob's that we have talked about today.",100,,
503,0.97,3393.556,3403.767,The initial group included my office of the planning and community development in the Department of neighborhoods and the office of economic development.,100,,
504,0.97,3403.767,3410.673,And so we set the groundwork for the organizational readiness criteria.,100,,
505,0.97,3410.673,3412.075,We also broaden staff from FAS obviously.,100,,
506,0.97,3412.075,3417.313,And he the human services Department.,100,,
507,0.97,3417.313,3422.318,"And so, this group--and the office of housing as well to review housing potential on any of these sites.",100,,
508,0.97,3422.318,3438.902,So included a statement of interest from the community organizations and then met continuously from 2019 until 2020.,100,,
509,0.97,3438.902,3444.307,And make sure all the community organizations have the organizational community that they will be demonstrating benefits.,100,,
510,0.97,3444.307,3466.262,And the current operations and facility maintenance on the same page understanding the building itself and developing long-term replacement plans and making sure there is a clear public record that the community supports this transfer of property.,100,,
511,0.97,3466.262,3468.131,And I will be glad to answer any questions.,100,,
512,0.97,3468.131,3471.668,"For now, I will turn it over to Karen for the next slide.",100,,
513,0.97,3471.668,3477.841,I will take the next slide Úand then Karen can go to the final one.,101,,
514,0.97,3477.841,3503.5,"This is just to reiterate some of what Christie has talked about, which is a history of this building, which was purchased in 1877 with accommodation of state bonds and Cdgb bonds with some of the organizational eligibility requiring us to deal a little more with a deep dive in terms of making sure we were aware of what the criteria was that we needed to continue for those funds.",101,,
515,0.97,3503.5,3511.307,Pna was done in 1980 with a Federal grant as Christie was saying.,101,,
516,0.97,3511.307,3513.142,Now serves well over 2500 community members.,101,,
517,0.97,3513.142,3516.813,Then the city entered into this negotiation back in 1887.,101,,
518,0.97,3516.813,3520.783,Shortly after that realizing we probably needed to move.,101,,
519,0.97,3520.783,3525.822,I remember for my part that this conversation started with the Nichols administration.,101,,
520,0.97,3525.822,3538.268,To give you a quick summary and the next slide we'll talk about key elements of the agreement and then we can pause for questions.,101,,
521,0.97,3538.268,3539.636,Thank you.,102,,
522,0.97,3539.636,3549.545,And FAS as a department in the city is thrilled to be a part of this transaction and it is a long time coming.,102,,
523,0.97,3549.545,3556.085,The key points of the agreement between the city and the Pna to transfer the Greenwood senior center are summarized on the slide.,102,,
524,0.97,3556.085,3560.924,The first is that the Pna will continue to provide social services to the public with a focus on seniors.,102,,
525,0.97,3560.924,3575.071,The second is that the Pna will assume all environmental risk and the Pna signifies the city for environment the liabilities associated with the property.,102,,
526,0.97,3575.071,3586.916,"The third is that if the Pna Redevelop the property for some reason or expands, the improvements should be for the provision of social services which may be combined with affordable housing.",102,,
527,0.97,3586.916,3592.956,And then the property shall revert to the city's ownership if it is not used for the provision of social services.,102,,
528,0.97,3592.956,3596.392,That is the final point.,102,,
529,0.97,3596.392,3600.363,"I think with this, we have the end of the presentation and we will turn it over to Lish or the chair.",102,,
530,0.97,3600.363,3610.873,Any further comments? I have some questions to kick us off.,103,,
531,0.97,3610.873,3612.008,I think Councilmember Pedersen has amendments.,103,,
532,0.97,3612.008,3635.264,"Briefly, the city and the neighborhood Association and obligations under way have a grant which requires an agreement and that will extend for 15 years under the agreement and then under parts of Federal law for another five years after the agreement is completed.",104,,
533,0.97,3635.264,3649.245,But the city requirements under state law and that sort of funding will extend forever as far as I can tell.,104,,
534,0.97,3649.245,3656.686,So the property will be required to be used for social services for as long as state law will require it.,104,,
535,0.97,3656.686,3657.453,Thank you.,105,,
536,0.97,3657.453,3664.56,"You answered two of my questions there which is, can you elaborate on the requirements for affordable housing.",105,,
537,0.97,3664.56,3674.971,Understand it is 80% and that will extend as long as the state law is in place regarding this as well as the services that will be provided to seniors.,105,,
538,0.97,3674.971,3679.275,So there is a requirement for both senior services and affordable housing.,105,,
539,0.97,3679.275,3680.076,Is that a correct understanding?,105,,
540,0.97,3680.076,3683.379,Yes.,106,,
541,0.97,3683.379,3686.983,So it is required to be used for social services.,106,,
542,0.97,3686.983,3692.922,The services can be accompanied by affordable housing.,106,,
543,0.97,3692.922,3708.905,And the Affordability and the agreement is all units 80% below the median income and at least half affordable at 60% of immediate income or below.,106,,
544,0.97,3708.905,3710.239,"It is currently at 60, not 80?",107,,
545,0.97,3710.239,3712.308,All of them below 80 and at least half below 60.,108,,
546,0.97,3712.308,3720.917,Thank you for that clarification.,109,,
547,0.97,3720.917,3722.952,"And then, that is only if the property is Redeveloped, is that correct?",109,,
548,0.97,3722.952,3724.454,Correct.,110,,
549,0.97,3724.454,3732.128,"And Christie, can you remind me--it is my understanding there are no plans for redevelopment.",111,,
550,0.97,3732.128,3732.528,Is that correct?,111,,
551,0.97,3732.528,3746.843,"We don't have any specific plans . But we are looking at what the opportunities, options and best use could be.",112,,
552,0.97,3746.843,3750.947,Great.,113,,
553,0.97,3750.947,3754.217,And for the viewing public that cannot see the amazing director who has joined us as well.,113,,
554,0.97,3754.217,3758.354,He has been here the whole time and is waving to say hello.,113,,
555,0.97,3758.354,3760.723,"Director, any words before we get into questions and amendments?",113,,
556,0.97,3760.723,3771.067,Sorry for being late to the party.,114,,
557,0.97,3771.067,3771.901,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",114,,
558,0.97,3771.901,3785.681,I have nothing to add for the materials that have been presented by director Mantilla and KATY and our office.,114,,
559,0.97,3785.681,3787.083,This has been a long time coming.,114,,
560,0.97,3787.083,3792.755,It is great to be at this point.,114,,
561,0.97,3792.755,3794.891,"Thank you, director.",115,,
562,0.97,3794.891,3802.899,"Colleagues, any other questions or I will pass it off to Councilmember Pedersen who has a number of amendments to bring forward today?",115,,
563,0.97,3802.899,3805.935,"Seeing no questions, Councilmember Pedersen, please take it away.",115,,
564,0.97,3805.935,3821.017,Thank you chair Strauss and for the Phinney neighborhood Association for all the work you have done for decades and will continue to do and the two amendments are mainly to strengthen the public benefit notion of this structure.,116,,
565,0.97,3821.017,3835.932,I do have concerns with how the Jenny Durkan administration--and I know this was inherited from the Murray administration and it was going on back then as well.,116,,
566,0.97,3835.932,3848.544,"And structuring a transfer in Perpetuity of public property, given public property to a private entity basically in Perpetuity with these restrictions.",116,,
567,0.97,3848.544,3861.724,"Rather than what I have seen in jurisdictions across the country which is--and I have scene is more common when transferring public property, to do it with a 99 year lease or other long-term lease.",116,,
568,0.97,3861.724,3863.192,They give to the same benefits.,116,,
569,0.97,3863.192,3871.834,You can still Redevelop property and get financing through the 99 year lease but it keeps the land and public ownership and I have seen that throughout the country.,116,,
570,0.97,3871.834,3879.375,"And the Rcw, that undergirds our ability to do this Rcw40 3.",116,,
571,0.97,3879.375,3879.675,83.410.,116,,
572,0.97,3879.675,3886.983,"It specifically calls out leases, long term leases as an option.",116,,
573,0.97,3886.983,3896.893,I just wanted to put that out there that that is sort of an overall concern with the Jenny Durkan administration.,116,,
574,0.97,3896.893,3900.663,"Looking at these lease options going forward, these two amendments would simply strengthen the public benefit.",116,,
575,0.97,3900.663,3911.54,The first one clarifies and makes it more clear when title would automatically revert back to the city governments.,116,,
576,0.97,3911.54,3919.916,And the other one is to focus--it sounds like there are no immediate plans to Redevelop.,116,,
577,0.97,3919.916,3920.916,"Ideally, this will matter that much.",116,,
578,0.97,3920.916,3924.954,Amendment two because it is focusing on very low income households.,116,,
579,0.97,3924.954,3935.931,Especially seniors typically would fit this low income measure of 50% AMI instead of 80%.,116,,
580,0.97,3935.931,3951.914,"Right now 80% AMI is over $90,000 for a family of four Extrapolating the rooms being about 2000 for a two bedroom unit which is about at markets a really are not even below market if they are 80%.",116,,
581,0.97,3951.914,3954.717,So that is what amendment two is.,116,,
582,0.97,3954.717,3962.825,"Chair, what I can do is move the amendments and answer questions for each one.",116,,
583,0.97,3962.825,3964.06,Or I can take questions now.,116,,
584,0.97,3964.06,3964.66,However you want to do it?,116,,
585,0.97,3964.66,3970.333,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,117,,
586,0.97,3970.333,3971.967,Let's do it one at a time.,117,,
587,0.97,3971.967,3976.439,I'm supporting amendment one and I will be supporting amendment two and I will be happy to share why.,117,,
588,0.97,3976.439,3991.42,"As far as amendment one goes, as you mentioned, this is technical and clarifying in nature and I don't have any further discussion.",117,,
589,0.97,3991.42,4000.029,"Colleagues, any further discussion about amendment one and can you pull this up on the screen so we can have a visual of what we are voting on?",117,,
590,0.97,4000.029,4011.774,And thank you to Lish and the law Department for looking at these so quickly.,118,,
591,0.97,4011.774,4016.812,Great.,119,,
592,0.97,4016.812,4033.095,So this is essentially putting in a calm in a paragraph and green Enumerating the remainder of exhibit B.,119,,
593,0.97,4033.095,4043.606,"And discussions with the law Department, the way it read originally, because several things are Squished together, by separating them, it makes it much more clear.",120,,
594,0.97,4043.606,4045.508,Especially something that will be in place for so long.,120,,
595,0.97,4045.508,4050.479,It will be good to have this clarity.,120,,
596,0.97,4050.479,4051.447,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,121,,
597,0.97,4051.447,4061.023,Did you bring this amendment for the central area seniors center?,121,,
598,0.97,4061.023,4062.958,The agreements were different because they didn't have the same funding sources.,122,,
599,0.97,4062.958,4067.863,Thank you.,123,,
600,0.97,4067.863,4068.564,Helpful clarification.,123,,
601,0.97,4068.564,4074.537,"Colleagues, any further questions on this amendment?",123,,
602,0.97,4074.537,4076.806,"If not, Councilmember Pedersen, you are free to move it.",123,,
603,0.97,4076.806,4078.174,"Thank you, chair.",124,,
604,0.97,4078.174,4087.083,"Colleagues, I would like to move to amend counsel bill 120086 by amending it with this amendment.",124,,
605,0.97,4087.083,4087.716,Amendment one before us today.,124,,
606,0.97,4087.716,4088.25,I will second that.,125,,
607,0.97,4088.25,4088.617,Thank you.,126,,
608,0.97,4088.617,4099.395,It has been moved and Seconded to amend counsel bill 120086.,127,,
609,0.97,4099.395,4099.962,Will you please call role.,127,,
610,0.97,4099.962,4103.399,Pedersen.,128,,
611,0.97,4103.399,4103.799,As it.,129,,
612,0.97,4103.799,4104.266,Council member Lewis.,129,,
613,0.97,4104.266,4106.969,Yes.,130,,
614,0.97,4106.969,4107.57,Councilmember Mosqueda.,131,,
615,0.97,4107.57,4114.076,Yes.,132,,
616,0.97,4114.076,4114.543,Chair Strauss.,133,,
617,0.97,4114.543,4114.81,Yes.,134,,
618,0.97,4114.81,4115.644,Four in favor and Unopposed.,135,,
619,0.97,4115.644,4120.683,Motion carries.,136,,
620,0.97,4120.683,4134.797,Councilmember Pedersen . The two questions I have for you is if you are able to do outreach at the Phinney neighborhood Association prior to proposing this amendment and just clarify for the record when the amendment was circulated.,136,,
621,0.97,4134.797,4145.14,"Since we received this legislation, it was approved on the introduction referral calendar less than 48 hours ago.",137,,
622,0.97,4145.14,4153.682,I am glad that my staff and I were able to go through the 45 pages of the eight documents and confer with the law Department on this.,137,,
623,0.97,4153.682,4160.523,Since there are no late plans for housing development on this project.,137,,
624,0.97,4160.523,4165.161,But this legislation is granting the property and Perpetuity.,137,,
625,0.97,4165.161,4174.069,"I think this would focus it in on very low income housing and would serve the public benefit better, the city better.",137,,
626,0.97,4174.069,4175.137,Especially with the homelessness crisis.,137,,
627,0.97,4175.137,4181.577,And most seniors would be 50% AMI or less.,137,,
628,0.97,4181.577,4183.445,I'm concerned because I know the rent is at market.,137,,
629,0.97,4183.445,4192.087,So it is not even below market at 80% AMI and the addition is to bring them below market.,137,,
630,0.97,4192.087,4198.194,"At 50% AMI, it is a standard used by several HUD programs and other housing programs and even the housing levy.",137,,
631,0.97,4198.194,4207.203,"So that is why they came in at the 50% level, for the public benefit.",137,,
632,0.97,4207.203,4209.705,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,138,,
633,0.97,4209.705,4218.948,"I will let the record reflect that in addition to the housing, there are social services which is the crux of why I can't support the amendment today, Councilmember Pedersen.",138,,
634,0.97,4218.948,4222.785,Absolutely support your desire and agree with you about 80% and market rate.,138,,
635,0.97,4222.785,4236.298,"But because we have senior services, social services occurring on site as Mr. woods and us know, there is an additional requirement of below 60% AMI.",138,,
636,0.97,4236.298,4246.675,"And Mr. Woodson, can you remind the Committeethat the requirements are for all housing to be under 80%?",138,,
637,0.97,4246.675,4251.046,Let me share this amendment.,139,,
638,0.97,4251.046,4264.426,This includes the underlying language.,139,,
639,0.97,4264.426,4265.427,It's not showing up anymore.,139,,
640,0.97,4265.427,4275.671,Just a second.,139,,
641,0.97,4282.611,4311.24,"Under the existing language, affordable housing on the site needs to be affordable to households with income levels of up to 80% median income and with the majority of units serving counsel at 60% of area median income.",140,,
642,0.97,4311.24,4316.478,Okay.,141,,
643,0.97,4316.478,4323.419,Thank you.,141,,
644,0.97,4323.419,4324.72,"Councilmember Strauss, did you have something to add to that?",141,,
645,0.97,4324.72,4326.221,I was just going to try to move it.,142,,
646,0.97,4326.221,4326.622,Great.,143,,
647,0.97,4326.622,4334.93,And I appreciate you bringing this forward.,143,,
648,0.97,4334.93,4337.933,I think it was brought with good faith and good intention.,143,,
649,0.97,4337.933,4338.801,And my apologies.,143,,
650,0.97,4338.801,4348.143,My assumption had been that everyone had been briefed about this due to the fact that it had been part of the bird bar and central area seniors center package.,143,,
651,0.97,4348.143,4359.154,I guess that was my view of being so engaged in land use issues.,143,,
652,0.97,4359.154,4361.123,So my apologies to you Councilmember Pedersen.,143,,
653,0.97,4361.123,4370.032,I also want to recognize that for the months of work that went into negotiating the details of this agreement between the city and Phinney is what makes it hard for me to vote for this.,143,,
654,0.97,4370.032,4382.711,And I don't believe it would be appropriate to change the terms of the agreement in this final step in the process without a longer consultation with the community organizations providing these services.,143,,
655,0.97,4382.711,4389.084,And there are no current plans to Redevelop the site.,143,,
656,0.97,4389.084,4394.757,So we can't--we are discussing what could be in the future.,143,,
657,0.97,4394.757,4411.306,"My concerns about the impact of the 50% requirement is that when we have so many other city requirements and mechanisms geared toward the 60% AMI Affordability level, there are two things.",143,,
658,0.97,4411.306,4424.787,There is a 60% requirement and we have these other requirements from the city that just make this process--I don't see the wrinkles being ironed out.,143,,
659,0.97,4424.787,4436.865,"Most apparently, it is my understanding that in the event of the redevelopment, any housing portion would likely be I effect and subsidizing the senior services that the Pna would be required to provide.",143,,
660,0.97,4436.865,4462.858,"If the Pna is unable to provide housing Affordability while providing senior services, the Redevelopment would otherwise--we are Redeveloping otherwise underutilized parcels providing senior services and housing and allowing the housing to be up to 80% AMI to help subsidize the services is what I'm trying to say here.",143,,
661,0.97,4462.858,4473.535,"And reducing the requirements 50% would make it more challenging for the senior services provided . and Christie, did I summarize that correctly?",143,,
662,0.97,4473.535,4474.636,Do you have thoughts you want to share?,143,,
663,0.97,4474.636,4482.511,And they see the vice chair Mosqueda and Councilmember Pedersen.,143,,
664,0.97,4482.511,4482.845,Yes.,144,,
665,0.97,4482.845,4483.745,You did summarize that correctly.,144,,
666,0.97,4483.745,4488.684,And I will just clarify that my comments about no immediate plans for redevelopment.,144,,
667,0.97,4488.684,4493.288,We do plan to have a redevelopment of the site.,144,,
668,0.97,4493.288,4500.796,"And I think we are in favor of when that happens, looking at all options.",144,,
669,0.97,4500.796,4516.678,"And so for us, we are in favor of an agreement that provides the most flexibility to do the biggest impact utilizing the resources that we can in supporting the community with housing and social services.",144,,
670,0.97,4516.678,4517.379,"Thank you, Kristi.",145,,
671,0.97,4517.379,4520.148,Vice chair Mosqueda.,145,,
672,0.97,4520.148,4526.121,Thank you so much.,146,,
673,0.97,4526.121,4536.532,I just want to let Councilmember Pedersen know that I will not be able to support the amendment today for reasons outlined by the chair.,146,,
674,0.97,4536.532,4547.342,"And I appreciate, Kristi, your follow-up comments and I understand there will probably be opportunities to work with you and what the best use is.",146,,
675,0.97,4547.342,4550.946,And appreciate you noting the housing and the importance of that.,146,,
676,0.97,4550.946,4551.647,Especially in the area.,146,,
677,0.97,4551.647,4561.857,"With that, I just wanted to make sure that I was Transparence about where I was out on this amendment and thank you for the intent behind it but not able to support today.",146,,
678,0.97,4561.857,4567.362,Thank you.,147,,
679,0.97,4567.362,4572.534,Councilmember Pedersen.,147,,
680,0.97,4572.534,4580.475,"And of Councilmember Trollope doesn't have anything to say, I will let you rounded out for this time.",147,,
681,0.97,4580.475,4582.744,Thank you.,148,,
682,0.97,4582.744,4584.012,Maybe Lish can answer this question.,148,,
683,0.97,4584.012,4596.992,"It brings up an interesting point about, what happened--what happens if the property is Redeveloped and there are several profit motivated transactions that occur.",148,,
684,0.97,4596.992,4615.11,"A real estate developer, a For- profit real estate developer, would they be allowed to Redevelop or profit from a developer fee from this Quicksand is one.",148,,
685,0.97,4615.11,4627.122,"And then the net operating income from that property, where is the net operating income and cash flow from the property allowed to go?",148,,
686,0.97,4627.122,4633.161,"And third, cannot be resold to another entity as long as the services are provided?",148,,
687,0.97,4633.161,4639.935,"And if it is sold, where did net sale proceeds go?",148,,
688,0.97,4639.935,4659.654,"So we are talking about a For- profit transaction that is here as a potentiality, both with a developer fee, developer profit and the net operating income and cash flow and proceeds if the property is Redeveloped and eventually sold.",148,,
689,0.97,4659.654,4666.128,Where does the money go that we are enabling to happen with giving this property away in Perpetuity?,148,,
690,0.97,4666.128,4669.664,Can't answer all those questions.,149,,
691,0.97,4669.664,4689.484,What we have seen with other development projects is that an organization like Phinney neighborhood Association tends not to have the expertise and howls to Redevelop a property like this.,149,,
692,0.97,4689.484,4704.8,"So we will typically partner with an organization, either nonprofit or For-Profit or developer that has had expertise and can construct the building.",149,,
693,0.97,4704.8,4714.409,"And developers tend to need developer fees to pay costs, both personnel and the costs and the transaction costs as part of those deals.",149,,
694,0.97,4714.409,4729.091,"So it is likely that the Phinney neighborhood Association, unless they higher for someone in house, would be Partnering with another developer.",149,,
695,0.97,4729.091,4740.001,And they would not be permitted to sell the property with the profits from the sale going--with all the property Reverting back to the city under the state law provisions.,149,,
696,0.97,4740.001,4748.81,So they would need to remain owners of the property or else it will come back to the city.,149,,
697,0.97,4748.81,4753.515,"And so long term, they would be the owners and managers of the affordable housing site.",149,,
698,0.97,4753.515,4759.121,That is my understanding of the agreement.,149,,
699,0.97,4759.121,4761.223,But Karen--can correct me if I have anything wrong.,149,,
700,0.97,4761.223,4768.797,"I agree with you, Lish.",150,,
701,0.97,4768.797,4770.132,"Councilmember Pedersen, does that answer your question?",151,,
702,0.97,4770.132,4778.74,Is not clear where the excess debt operating income or cash flow will go during the ownership.,152,,
703,0.97,4778.74,4787.115,That is the only remaining question I think.,152,,
704,0.97,4787.115,4796.992,It is my understanding that goes back to subsidized services provided on-site.,153,,
705,0.97,4796.992,4801.696,"Director Mantilla, if you want to jump in.",154,,
706,0.97,4801.696,4802.063,Or Kristi.,154,,
707,0.97,4802.063,4807.302,I know Councilmember Pedersen can have an off-line conversation with you.,154,,
708,0.97,4807.302,4821.016,I just want to center for the discussion on the record that this was part of the package and the other two parts of the package already came before Council and were voted on.,154,,
709,0.97,4821.016,4844.039,"This is a third part of the package which, my apologies Councilmember Pedersen, for my assumption that this would be Uncontroversial and Lastly, in your line of questioning, the benefits being provided to the city through social services and it sounds like we have a disagreement on the affordable housing being a social service to the city.",154,,
710,0.97,4844.039,4854.95,Just wanted to again round this out with the fact that if there is the prophet occurring that the property will revert back to the city.,154,,
711,0.97,4854.95,4866.728,"So I see Kristi Beckley has her hand raised and director Mantilla, if you have anything to share.",154,,
712,0.97,4866.728,4868.863,And of course Councilmember you will have the last word before moving the agenda.,154,,
713,0.97,4868.863,4884.045,"Just to jump in and confirm that, yes, any benefits from the housing profits or cash flow if you will would go back into services as an operator of those services.",155,,
714,0.97,4884.045,4902.864,And just to say that our intent would also be to partner with another nonprofit housing organization . and no we do not have a developmental Department on staff.,155,,
715,0.97,4902.864,4904.299,"Thank you, Kristi.",156,,
716,0.97,4904.299,4906.167,"Director Mantilla, anything you would like to share?",156,,
717,0.97,4906.167,4916.478,Just to underscore the principle of cash generated going back to the community organization or sustain organization is a core principle of the community wealth building model that we are hoping is sustained here.,157,,
718,0.97,4916.478,4921.449,So just to add that.,157,,
719,0.97,4921.449,4923.118,Thank you.,158,,
720,0.97,4923.118,4927.389,"Director nay for, can you confirm the 80% AMI was also on the other two agreements, is that correct?",158,,
721,0.97,4927.389,4927.756,Correct.,159,,
722,0.97,4927.756,4936.931,"Councilmember Pedersen, would you like to move for motion?",160,,
723,0.97,4936.931,4938.633,"Thank you, Council members.",161,,
724,0.97,4938.633,4950.879,"So we can have this on the record, I would like to move to amend counsel bill told hundred 86 as shown in amendment 22 and change it to 50% AMI.",161,,
725,0.97,4950.879,4958.553,It has been moved and Seconded.,162,,

819,0.97,5364.692,5371.933,Thank you for the introductions and you are absolutely correct that this has been a long time coming.,202,,
820,0.97,5371.933,5387.281,I stand on the shoulders of the great work of director Alvarado and the great work Nick has been doing in our office on this one.,202,,
821,0.97,5387.281,5392.453,Go to the next slide.,202,,
822,0.97,5392.453,5401.462,What we will go through and I will hand the baton back to director Alvarado in a second.,203,,
823,0.97,5401.462,5411.372,We want to give a little background on the origins of the proposal and talk about the eligibility and Affordability requirements.,203,,
824,0.97,5411.372,5435.53,We want to make sure you understand what we have heard from the Stakeholders in this process as well as a summary of proposed Land-Use changes and the impact of this for our community as something that a lot of folks have really been looking forward to with this coming to pass.,203,,
825,0.97,5435.53,5435.863,Back to you.,203,,
826,0.97,5435.863,5458.719,"As mentioned, this is a new tool that would allow for religious institutions to access additional development capacity when they Redevelop their property for a long term rent and income restricted affordable housing.",204,,
827,0.97,5458.719,5480.775,"And as mentioned, this is local legislation that implements state legislation and as was commented on by public comment earlier this morning, this is following--the local legislation is following years of advocacy at the state level including by faith organizations who sought to use their land in a way that fits with their values and mission.",204,,
828,0.97,5480.775,5490.351,"And at the state, the state passed substitute House bill 1377 as Ketil mentioned.",204,,
829,0.97,5490.351,5499.994,And that law requires local jurisdictions to adopt these allowances that would create additional density for affordable housing on religious land.,204,,
830,0.97,5499.994,5509.203,It is the state requirement that we are implementing and doing so in a way that is consistent with some of our local needs and priorities and the public comment that we heard.,204,,
831,0.97,5509.203,5509.57,Next line.,205,,
832,0.97,5509.57,5515.877,"Director Alvarado, I know we discussed the difference between these.",206,,
833,0.97,5515.877,5522.216,I understand the state legislation States that we shall implement this law.,206,,
834,0.97,5522.216,5526.454,Is this a correct understanding?,206,,
835,0.97,5526.454,5526.954,Exactly right.,207,,
836,0.97,5526.954,5543.104,"If you zoom and very close to the picture of the bill that you see on the right, it does say that a city planning under this chapter must allow an increased density bonus.",207,,
837,0.97,5543.104,5553.347,Severe acting consistent with the direction from the state and the state also recognizes that that should be implemented consistent with local needs for affordable housing and that is what you will see reflected in the proposal.,207,,
838,0.97,5553.347,5560.855,"To take that one step closer, we would be out of compliance if we would not passes, is that a correct understanding?",208,,
839,0.97,5560.855,5569.931,I think it is fair to say that the state is directing us to do so.,209,,
840,0.97,5569.931,5573.935,I think it is also fair to say that there are many jurisdictions that have not yet implement at this.,209,,
841,0.97,5573.935,5576.404,And we would be on the early side of taking action to implement this.,209,,
842,0.97,5576.404,5580.975,Wonderful.,210,,
843,0.97,5580.975,5581.309,Thank you.,210,,
844,0.97,5581.309,5593.788,The state is prescriptive in the law about what the eligibility and Affordability levels are come to access the additional development capacity.,211,,
845,0.97,5593.788,5607.702,"And under the state law which we are tracking as part of the local legislation, to access this new tool, a property must be owned or controlled by a religious organization.",211,,
846,0.97,5607.702,5622.35,"All housing must be income restricted and in layman's terms, that is the people that occupy either the ownership or rental units have to be income eligible and the housing can be rental or ownership.",211,,
847,0.97,5622.35,5639.033,"But regardless of rental or ownership, there is all of the units that have to be affordable at least 80% of area median income or below.",211,,
848,0.97,5639.033,5655.716,"And mentioned by Councilmember Pedersen earlier, roughly that equates to a four person household at around $92,000 annually or one person household around 65 thousand dollars annually with current AMI.",211,,
849,0.97,5655.716,5677.371,"And probably most important to this legislation, all property that accesses the additional developing capacity must be affordable for at least 50 years and that is with a Covenant is so that runs with the land regardless of whether the property is sold.",211,,
850,0.97,5677.371,5699.627,"And I should explain for the viewing audience that when something is rent and income restricted for 50 years, that means the office of housing does compliance monitoring on Úthe units to make sure during the Affordability term, the units are occupied by folks that are income eligible and the rent and Affordability levels are consistent with what needs to be done.",211,,
851,0.97,5699.627,5722.583,"And director Alvarado, is it a correct understanding that to be will to meet these Affordability metric benchmarks, that institutions are dissipating in the program would almost be guaranteed a high likelihood that they would be accepting public funds?",212,,
852,0.97,5722.583,5726.821,And does not increase the requirements for them to provide public housing?,212,,
853,0.97,5726.821,5735.129,"Does that strengthen any of these for time, duration or AMI?",212,,
854,0.97,5735.129,5736.33,Great question.,213,,
855,0.97,5736.33,5744.238,I would say that I anticipate at this point that most properties that would access this development capacity would also be seeking public subsidy from either the city or other public Funders.,213,,
856,0.97,5744.238,5768.662,"That is because when you are building is Holy at 80% AMI, even if it might not be too to similar from the market, a 50 regular trade agreement does, in many cases, act as a barrier to people who would want to do something else with their property, who would want to use it as a cash generating property.",213,,
857,0.97,5768.662,5773.134,Some anticipate that most projects will also seek public subsidy.,213,,
858,0.97,5773.134,5774.769,It is not the case that that is required.,213,,
859,0.97,5774.769,5787.214,So there could be cases where there are properties developed under this have become income restricted by 50 years by virtue of this incentive along.,213,,
860,0.97,5787.214,5791.619,But it is likely not that valuable of an incentive to see that happen in too many cases.,213,,
861,0.97,5791.619,5792.019,Thank you.,214,,
862,0.97,5792.019,5804.899,"I would say that where public subsidy goes into projects, our housing funding policies do drive subsidy and to lower Affordability levels.",215,,
863,0.97,5804.899,5811.305,"So I would say our housing levy for example, in the rental space is at 60% AMI and below although ownership is 80.",215,,
864,0.97,5811.305,5817.044,"So where public subsidy comes into play, many of these units would be more affordable.",215,,
865,0.97,5817.044,5821.515,I will pass it to Daniel.,215,,
866,0.97,5821.515,5822.216,Thank you.,216,,
867,0.97,5822.216,5832.993,"And development of this proposed legislation, the office of planning and community development staff did extensive community outreach and engagement from various Stakeholders.",216,,
868,0.97,5832.993,5837.932,We met with faith organizations with exploring redevelopment.,216,,
869,0.97,5837.932,5847.608,Those in the early stages and those who are more in depth and have a proposal in mind.,216,,
870,0.97,5847.608,5859.453,We also engaged with Neighborhood-Based efforts within the central district and affordable housing developers and did other outreach.,216,,
871,0.97,5859.453,5862.356,"Through that process and then engagement, we found some common themes.",216,,
872,0.97,5862.356,5875.536,First was the desire to include community spaces such as office space for the faith organization and space for Nonprofits and a commercial space for community based small business that could be part of a larger redevelopment effort of the project.,216,,
873,0.97,5875.536,5886.881,Another theme in alignment with what director Alvarado mentioned regarding the likelihood for public subsidy and what that would require.,216,,
874,0.97,5886.881,5898.792,So any need for technical support which includes in partnership with nonprofit housing providers who regularly operate in this space.,216,,
875,0.97,5898.792,5904.999,Regulatory support that this will help to provide.,216,,
876,0.97,5904.999,5918.979,"And this Lastly, the organization's made clear that any development moving forward, they would continue to engage the community in this work and in this process so that it would be a community inclusive process and development proposal.",216,,
877,0.97,5918.979,5926.587,"With that, I will turn it over to Nick who will go into more details.",216,,
878,0.97,5926.587,5928.922,"Thank you, Daniel.",217,,
879,0.97,5928.922,5934.862,"In addition to talking with Stakeholders over the last year, we have also analyzed were faith institutions own property in Seattle.",217,,
880,0.97,5934.862,5944.104,"We found that the sites are located in neighborhoods throughout the city and across a range of zones and at the size of the properties, it differs quite widely.",217,,
881,0.97,5944.104,5950.144,Some are small sites and others are much larger.,217,,
882,0.97,5950.144,5956.317,"Altogether, the property amounts to just about 1% of all Seattle land.",217,,
883,0.97,5956.317,5969.963,This proposed development focuses on a small share of sites in the city and specifically for long-term affordable housing on those sites.,217,,
884,0.97,5969.963,5971.432,Those tools will be available on religious properties citywide.,217,,
885,0.97,5971.432,5977.571,We have tailored the development bonus to specific context which we will describe in a moment.,217,,
886,0.97,5977.571,5992.486,And we have completed the environmental review of the proposal under the state and governmental policy act or Cepa and there is a public hearing scheduled in this Committee on June 23rd.,217,,
887,0.97,5992.486,5997.191,"Before we look at the specific details, this is how it would work at a high level.",217,,
888,0.97,5997.191,6006.0,"Religious organizations often have a portion of the land that is underdeveloped like in this case, the surface parking lot we have illustrated.",217,,
889,0.97,6006.0,6011.705,And they make these other changes or challenges like having a facility that is to be upgraded or expanded.,217,,
890,0.97,6011.705,6014.208,We have heard examples of that through our outreach.,217,,
891,0.97,6014.208,6022.516,"Currently, when they Redevelop the property, religious organizations are limited to the height and the scale of the existing zoning allowed.",217,,
892,0.97,6022.516,6028.255,This diagram imagines that could be a four story development based on current zoning rules.,217,,
893,0.97,6028.255,6029.49,The proposal here would provide flexibility.,217,,
894,0.97,6029.49,6042.669,"Someone faith institutions are pursuing long-term affordable housing, they cannot compete more effectively for public housing and that they can create more affordable homes than would otherwise be possible.",217,,
895,0.97,6042.669,6056.216,Can we go back to the last slide?,218,,
896,0.97,6056.216,6057.051,Actually keep moving.,218,,
897,0.97,6057.051,6059.353,This gets a little more into the specifics.,219,,
898,0.97,6059.353,6072.866,"The proposed legislation would intimate the development bonus for affordable housing primarily by allowing additional height, floor area or residential density on religious organization property.",219,,
899,0.97,6072.866,6078.472,This table summarizes those specific allowances depending on the type of zone.,219,,
900,0.97,6078.472,6081.141,So to just go row by row.,219,,
901,0.97,6081.141,6087.047,"And multi family zones, development under current zoning can range from 3-8 stories in height depending on the zone.",219,,
902,0.97,6087.047,6095.055,The proposal would allow for one additional floor of development for projects that are 100% affordable housing.,219,,
903,0.97,6095.055,6107.601,"Similarly in Mixed-Use commercial zones, maximum heights currently range from 3- 8 stories and the proposal here would allow 1-3 additional floors for affordable housing on faith owned sites.",219,,
904,0.97,6107.601,6118.479,"In zones with height limits above 85 feet, maximum height today Burying quite a bit today up to more than 40 stories depending on the zone in the neighborhood we are talking about.",219,,
905,0.97,6118.479,6125.185,"In these areas, the proposal would allow up to six additional floors.",219,,
906,0.97,6125.185,6128.889,"Again, depending on the specific zone.",219,,
907,0.97,6128.889,6140.534,"And finally, and single family zones, current rules set a height limit of three stories and a density limit of one unit or one home for a specific amount of area.",219,,
908,0.97,6140.534,6142.636,That amount differs on the zone.,219,,
909,0.97,6142.636,6144.805,"It ranges from 2000 to just under 10,000 square feet.",219,,
910,0.97,6144.805,6152.346,The proposal would generally maintain the existing height and scale of development that we already have in Single- family areas.,219,,
911,0.97,6152.346,6159.853,"But by lowering the density limit, it would allow more affordable homes to be created within that space.",219,,
912,0.97,6159.853,6165.526,And it would provide flexibility for other housing types like townhouses that could provide an affordable homeownership option.,219,,
913,0.97,6165.526,6166.226,This is really helpful.,220,,
914,0.97,6166.226,6173.934,Do you have a sense of which of these zones would probably have the most development?,220,,
915,0.97,6173.934,6175.202,Or are some more preferred or less preferred?,220,,
916,0.97,6175.202,6181.775,Yes.,221,,
917,0.97,6181.775,6201.595,"Most likely, the multifamily and Mixed-Use commercial zones are probably where there is the most opportunity to see the proposal put into action, just given the scale of development possible there and the type of affordable housing applications that the city often funds and we may want to elaborate on that.",221,,
918,0.97,6201.595,6217.311,"It is possible that in a Single- family context, like affordable Townhomes, they could provide a homeownership option that is similar to some recent affordable homeownership projects that Oh has funded.",221,,
919,0.97,6217.311,6227.421,"Just to reinforce the point, it is possible that developments can go forward without public subsidy and utilize this tool.",222,,
920,0.97,6227.421,6245.906,"However, where they are seeking subsidy, what I would say is we would typically see projects Údeveloping and multi family zones or Mixed-Use commercial zones because of the sense of scale that it allows us to invest in.",222,,
921,0.97,6245.906,6251.144,"Resources, we have invested in projects and High-Rise zones but notably one main one in the last many years.",222,,
922,0.97,6251.144,6272.532,"And in single-family zones, what our investment would most likely look like would be to permanently affordable homeownership and we have been increasing our investment in that space for Townhomes or cottages that are permanently affordable but a homebuyer option.",222,,
923,0.97,6272.532,6273.033,Thank you.,223,,
924,0.97,6273.033,6274.368,That was very helpful.,223,,
925,0.97,6274.368,6280.941,And congratulations and thank you director Alvarado.,223,,
926,0.97,6280.941,6288.448,Fast work on the Townhome project for habitat for humanity on 80th and 28th and Royal hates.,223,,
927,0.97,6288.448,6293.987,I was able to join you for the groundbreaking there in October and the for sale signs are already on the street.,223,,
928,0.97,6293.987,6312.973,So it is a great opportunity with single-family zones and I appreciate the comments that most likely we would be another zones to get the best return on investment.,223,,
929,0.97,6312.973,6318.111,Can you clarify for me the land must be owned by a religious institution?,223,,
930,0.97,6318.111,6321.181,That does not necessarily mean it is church.,223,,
931,0.97,6321.181,6323.55,So the example I will provide is also the Royal heights neighborhood.,223,,
932,0.97,6323.55,6329.723,There are three parcels parcels.,223,,
933,0.97,6329.723,6336.93,One is the church and another is the automotive repair that they went out to someone else and the third is an office building.,223,,
934,0.97,6336.93,6344.104,What all of these parcels be eligible for the program?,223,,
935,0.97,6344.104,6345.539,Or just the building that has a church?,223,,
936,0.97,6345.539,6350.077,It would be all parcels owned or controlled by a religious organization.,224,,
937,0.97,6350.077,6359.419,About two thirds based on our analysis are parcels that have a current use of a religious facility today that can be a church or some other place of worship.,224,,
938,0.97,6359.419,6363.39,It is recognized as a religious facility.,224,,
939,0.97,6363.39,6369.296,There are sites like you mentioned throughout the city were religious organizations on a different type of property or building.,224,,
940,0.97,6369.296,6374.868,Some of those are schools.,224,,
941,0.97,6374.868,6375.669,Some are housing.,224,,
942,0.97,6375.669,6379.106,There is a chart and the directors report that breaks down the analysis.,224,,
943,0.97,6379.106,6382.943,The answer to your question is that the provisions here for affordable housing would apply on all of those sites.,224,,
944,0.97,6382.943,6393.22,Thank you.,225,,
945,0.97,6394.121,6408.368,"It was mentioned in public, and that we should not see this as the be all end all of tools in addressing the affordable housing crisis and that is absolutely true.",226,,
946,0.97,6408.368,6421.448,What this does is helps to work in concert with many of the other activities that we are undertaking to support affordable housing to help make the investments and make the strategies go better and go further.,226,,
947,0.97,6421.448,6428.822,And so right here you see a picture of good shepherd supportive housing.,226,,
948,0.97,6428.822,6437.731,"I should remind you all that is part of our permanent housing pilot that we launched last year, we invested in six buildings to provide permanent housing.",226,,
949,0.97,6437.731,6452.512,"In one case, we made a conditional funding award to Lehigh and good Shepherd, to create permanent housing at 103 units in the central district.",226,,
950,0.97,6452.512,6465.158,This is a site owned by the congregation and the reason we made the conditional funding award is because the project did not have the necessary zoning capacity needed at the time to move forward with the level of speed we were hoping out of the pilot.,226,,
951,0.97,6465.158,6477.437,"So these are exactly the kinds of projects that we think will be facilitated and barriers will be produced, or reduced for these to go forward.",226,,
952,0.97,6477.437,6493.887,"Other examples, we just did an intent to apply where we sought information from the public about who intends to apply for city housing funds and we received an intent to apply from St. Luke's in Ballard and also from new hope missionary Baptist in the central district.",226,,
953,0.97,6493.887,6496.456,"Some more and more, we are seeing these Faith-Based partnerships.",226,,
954,0.97,6496.456,6500.26,And this legislation would help them to fulfill their mission.,226,,
955,0.97,6500.26,6511.571,"I also want to acknowledge to Daniel's point made earlier in the community outreach that increasingly, we are hearing from black churches in the central district who see using their land for their mission as a key way to help address displacement.",226,,
956,0.97,6511.571,6520.013,And this becomes a tool to help work with community organizations and religious organizations to see whether there is flexibility that will help them to achieve that goal.,226,,
957,0.97,6520.013,6521.214,"So again, this is a tool.",226,,
958,0.97,6521.214,6537.53,It is not a huge tool . But it helps us to move forward in facilitating the goals of religious organizations and does so in a way directed by state law.,226,,
959,0.97,6537.53,6552.445,"Director Alvarado, I have to compliment you on those last comments in scooping the story that I have been excited to work on for many months now which is assisting St. Luke's in their proposal to Redevelop the property.",227,,
960,0.97,6552.445,6552.812,Here it is.,227,,
961,0.97,6552.812,6555.916,It is now public.,227,,
962,0.97,6555.916,6562.155,I'm stealing your thunder.,228,,
963,0.97,6562.155,6562.956,Completely okay.,229,,
964,0.97,6562.956,6566.459,It is almost an entire city block in downtown Ballard.,229,,
965,0.97,6566.459,6579.839,This illustration provides the ability to put in one of the biggest new affordable housing programs in downtown Ballard.,229,,
966,0.97,6579.839,6589.282,We can literally change the face of downtown Ballard by passing this legislation and supporting St. Luke's in the Redevelopment plan program.,229,,
967,0.97,6589.282,6604.164,My office has been helping them along the way to move the process faster and get them ready to have submitted the request to you before we even were able to pass this bill we are Considerig today.,229,,
968,0.97,6604.164,6622.716,So thank you director Alvarado and I am excited to share more when the time is right about the redevelopment program that is being sought at St. Luke's property downtown Ballard.,229,,
969,0.97,6622.716,6624.818,Thank you.,229,,
970,0.97,6624.818,6628.188,And that is the end of the presentation.,230,,
971,0.97,6628.188,6633.526,"Councilmember Peterson, I see your hand is raised.",230,,
972,0.97,6633.526,6636.129,"Colleagues, any questions, now is a great time.",230,,
973,0.97,6636.129,6637.33,We are not putting on this today.,230,,
974,0.97,6637.33,6649.309,Is my typical rule of having it before us twice and we will be holding a public hearing on June 23rd.,230,,
975,0.97,6649.309,6650.31,"Councilmember Pedersen, take it away.",230,,
976,0.97,6650.31,6651.378,Thank you chair Strauss.,231,,
977,0.97,6651.378,6653.179,Was central staff going to present or talk more about their memo?,231,,
978,0.97,6653.179,6662.655,I'm happy to.,232,,
979,0.97,6662.655,6665.825,A lot of the content of the memo was described by Opcd and Oh just now.,232,,
980,0.97,6665.825,6671.731,There are three issues that I flagged for the committee consideration.,232,,
981,0.97,6671.731,6677.003,I will walk through each of those now.,232,,
982,0.97,6677.003,6685.645,There will be other issues community members identify under the course of their review of the bill.,233,,
983,0.97,6685.645,6687.38,I will just flag a few of them here.,233,,
984,0.97,6687.38,6697.49,The level of Affordability and the state statute SETS out 80% of AMI as a minimum in a 50 year term as the minimum.,233,,
985,0.97,6697.49,6713.707,I noted in the memo that some of our regulatory incentive programs have different levels of Affordability and notably the Mha program has a 60% level for rental and 80% for ownership and a 75 term for ownership.,233,,
986,0.97,6713.707,6722.082,And issue for the Council could be whether or not to true up this proposed tool with some of the other regular trade programs.,233,,
987,0.97,6722.082,6729.756,The designer you is currently not required for any affordable housing project because of Covid-19 modifications to our regular trade programs.,233,,
988,0.97,6729.756,6741.901,This proposal would allow development of a scale in single-family zones but would be subject to design review if they were in multifamily zones.,233,,
989,0.97,6741.901,6752.145,There is a question for the committee about whether to require a design review for projects that are available with this tool in single-family zones.,233,,
990,0.97,6752.145,6758.885,"Finally, there is an language owned and controlled by.",233,,
991,0.97,6758.885,6760.286,That comes directly from the state statute.,233,,
992,0.97,6760.286,6764.657,The city has some experience working with that.,233,,
993,0.97,6764.657,6775.235,With a description of a property interest when it comes to tiny House village is sponsored by organizations.,233,,
994,0.97,6775.235,6792.886,"And for the purposes of the city implementation of that language for tiny House villages, controlled by has been interpreted to mean something of a contractual fiscal sponsorship agreement.",233,,
995,0.97,6792.886,6797.957,"So a question here for the committee is, should there be some for the definition around the term controlled by?",233,,
996,0.97,6797.957,6806.599,"Those are three issues flagged, preliminary issues flag, for your consideration.",233,,
997,0.97,6806.599,6812.405,I think some can disagree and what to do with the issues and different approaches as the policy tools implementing it.,233,,
998,0.97,6812.405,6822.782,I'm happy to work with the committee and talk to Councilmembers on potential moments in order to help answer further questions.,233,,
999,0.97,6822.782,6837.163,"As I mentioned, the sooner you engage on this, the better because I can do some preliminary work and then hang things up to my colleagues when I go on vacation.",233,,
1000,0.97,6837.163,6837.73,Thank you.,234,,
1001,0.97,6837.73,6838.231,Councilmember Pedersen.,234,,
1002,0.97,6838.231,6838.698,Thank you.,235,,
1003,0.97,6838.698,6842.302,We appreciate and value your analysis and input on this.,235,,
1004,0.97,6842.302,6849.409,And those three issues you raised are really important in terms of focus saying this.,235,,
1005,0.97,6849.409,6852.979,I support the increased density here.,235,,
1006,0.97,6852.979,6860.019,And I wanted to be tied to vary low income housing.,235,,
1007,0.97,6860.019,6871.064,"And so the concept of touring it up to the Mha parameters, as we know, the state Legislature as a whole is by far more conservative than the city of Seattle.",235,,
1008,0.97,6871.064,6876.636,And so it is no surprise they would have done an 80% AMI as the up to level.,235,,
1009,0.97,6876.636,6892.418,"In the city of Seattle, knowing how high incomes are averaged out with the AMI, even though people are struggling because we are blessed to have such high paying Tech jobs and et cetera and it LIFTS up the AMI.",235,,
1010,0.97,6892.418,6896.656,And then the rental programs are pegged to that.,235,,
1011,0.97,6896.656,6902.996,"I would love to see focus more on low income--a very low income, excuse me.",235,,
1012,0.97,6902.996,6908.701,"50%, 60% AMI, et cetera.",235,,
1013,0.97,6908.701,6965.858,"And then this issue of control by a religious organization, I would think the intent of the state law is that it is something owned by religious organization or are controlled, something very strong such as a managing member of the limited liability company or the managing general partner of the limited partnership or something where they actually have real control and something that is well-known in business transactions to have actual control versus just a very loose Arm'S-Length transaction which seems like it would go against the intent of the law and the design review and single-family zones, I would have to talk about that and what that would mean.",235,,
1014,0.97,6965.858,6978.404,I really appreciate you raising these and I want to signal that I would be interested in working with at least another colleague on the committee to advance on that the next time we hear this?,235,,
1015,0.97,6978.404,6982.942,Thank you for that alert Councilmember Pedersen.,236,,
1016,0.97,6982.942,6984.043,Councilmember Lewis.,236,,
1017,0.97,6984.043,6986.646,Thank you Mr. chair.,237,,
1018,0.97,6986.646,6987.647,I have a question.,237,,
1019,0.97,6987.647,6997.156,It is sort of similar to the comments Councilmember Peterson raised just now around the Affordability thresholds.,237,,
1020,0.97,6997.156,7024.016,"When we worked on the legislation in the fall and in the winter around the permanent supportive housing streamlining and red tape cutting, we spent a lot of time talking about ways to have sideboards on that to make sure that the incomes we were talking about really were targeted toward folks chronically homeless and completely indigent.",237,,
1021,0.97,7024.016,7034.293,It is typically the AMI of near zero or what support they do have is being enrolled in SSI or something else.,237,,
1022,0.97,7034.293,7037.497,So making sure we could figure out ways to get that as low as possible.,237,,
1023,0.97,7037.497,7048.441,I remember there were issues surrounding just how the Finance saying of these projects generally works which required a higher thresholds.,237,,
1024,0.97,7048.441,7052.245,"Obviously, here, we are not talking exclusively about permanent supportive housing.",237,,
1025,0.97,7052.245,7081.908,"But I do wonder--sort of as a follow-up to Councilmember Pedersen's comments, if I can just hear a corresponding analysis for this project, similar to what we went through and some of the ways with how these projects are put together and financed that the AMI conversation and forms, it might be a useful refresher, certainly for me and the rest of the committee if someone on the panel wants to address it.",237,,
1026,0.97,7081.908,7091.384,"Councilmember Lewis, I would be happy to jump in.",238,,
1027,0.97,7091.384,7102.395,I think the distinction in this case is that this legislation is created in a way that it could potentially be accessed by buildings that do not seek public subsidies.,238,,
1028,0.97,7102.395,7119.879,"In that way, if a religious organization wanted to develop land and help address the affordable housing challenges with 80% AMI housing with long- term rent and they could figure out how to finance that without subsidy, they could do so.",238,,
1029,0.97,7119.879,7143.035,"I think that what your questions suggest and some of the earlier line of discussion from Councilmember Pedersen, is that if we were seeking to tie this land use code change specifically to projects that only accept public subsidy, we might contemplate pegging it at a different AMI level.",238,,
1030,0.97,7143.035,7157.95,"That is because our homeownership investments go up to 80% AMI but the rental investments, the vast majority of them Max out at 60% of area median income with a hyper friends and priority on extremely low income housing.",238,,
1031,0.97,7157.95,7171.664,"The two-year point, Councilmember Lewis, financing does sometimes drive us and other public policy goals drive us to create more mixed income from zero up to 60 with a mix of units.",238,,
1032,0.97,7171.664,7186.746,"The threshold question again for counsel is, do you want to keep open the idea that there are properties that might create affordable housing without subsidy and if so, the 80% creates some opportunity to do so.",238,,
1033,0.97,7186.746,7194.086,"If you would rather tie it more specifically to what we would be subsidizing at the office of housing, then that might justify different AMI's.",238,,
1034,0.97,7194.086,7195.388,"A follow-up really quick, Mr. chair, if I may.",239,,
1035,0.97,7195.388,7203.796,I appreciate the Clarifications.,240,,
1036,0.97,7203.796,7208.401,That is exactly what I was asking for.,240,,
1037,0.97,7208.401,7209.168,That was great.,240,,
1038,0.97,7209.168,7219.679,"In terms of the projects that are envisioned, when I look at this, I sort of think about, not the exact projects.",240,,
1039,0.97,7219.679,7228.754,"Maybe in some projects, the exact, I don't know if representative--through his efforts have sites.",240,,
1040,0.97,7228.754,7240.933,"But I think of the kind of developments like the home through hope, enterprise and trying to put together where it is sort of a mix.",240,,
1041,0.97,7240.933,7245.004,Like some market rate housing and some workforce housing.,240,,
1042,0.97,7245.004,7255.715,And this looks like a flexible enough model where someone could do something like that.,240,,
1043,0.97,7255.715,7268.261,Where there is kind of that big mix of different types all kind of Co- located with some sort of Childcare or retail space that is also included.,240,,
1044,0.97,7268.261,7277.77,I wonder if the Department or anyone has done any analysis on how we do anticipate people to respond to this regulation.,240,,
1045,0.97,7277.77,7287.68,Like are we expecting that more people are going to be maximizing it out to the 80% or having more of a workforce housing?,240,,
1046,0.97,7287.68,7294.854,To be expect a mix of models or do we expect people to go deep and try to do a subsidized Psh.,240,,
1047,0.97,7294.854,7296.989,It seems like they could do anything on the spectrum.,240,,
1048,0.97,7296.989,7304.063,And I wonder if there is a sense of how that would be distributed.,240,,
1049,0.97,7304.063,7305.297,That is part of the concern.,240,,
1050,0.97,7305.297,7315.608,"Ideally, we would like to see as much of this regulation change spur a lot more development at the lower end of AMI.",240,,
1051,0.97,7315.608,7329.322,And I think that in the interesting--it would be interesting if there is assessment of how we think the sector will respond to this change.,240,,
1052,0.97,7329.322,7332.992,"Mr. chair, if I can interrupt really quick, I apologize.",241,,
1053,0.97,7332.992,7335.494,I have a hard stop at 11:30.,241,,
1054,0.97,7335.494,7341.233,I wanted to go but I wanted to express my appreciation for the questions asked and the bills in front of us.,241,,
1055,0.97,7341.233,7360.486,"I would just want to be on the record saying that I support all the bills that we have not yet voted on and I look forward to full Council and director Alvarado, I'm sorry to interrupt you and I'm happy to support additional efforts to get more housing in the community, especially land like this with important partners.",241,,
1056,0.97,7360.486,7361.654,Thank you very much.,242,,
1057,0.97,7361.654,7371.03,We look forward to having you back in Committee next time and thank you for readjusting your schedule to make time today.,242,,
1058,0.97,7371.03,7371.964,You are awesome.,243,,
1059,0.97,7371.964,7374.033,"Thank you, vice chair.",243,,
1060,0.97,7374.033,7377.203,"Director Alvarado, please feel free to continue at your convenience.",243,,
1061,0.97,7377.203,7382.808,Thank you.,244,,
1062,0.97,7382.808,7389.181,I would say that my crystal ball might not be any better than yours about what might happen to development in the future.,244,,
1063,0.97,7389.181,7418.911,What I can say is that I would generally anticipate that most projects moving forward under this legislation would seek public subsidy because the incentive is not that valuable that it provides sufficient additional resources that can be driven into the project from the value of the added capacity itself.,244,,
1064,0.97,7418.911,7428.721,"So if projects seek public subsidy, that is when we get into the conversation of, what are the populations being served?",244,,
1065,0.97,7428.721,7432.358,"This is Agnostic to what those populations are, so long as they are income eligible.",244,,
1066,0.97,7432.358,7440.332,And it is really the funding process that goes to the office of housing in collaboration with the division of community partners that then dictates the mix of population.,244,,
1067,0.97,7440.332,7456.315,"Such as looking backwards at what we have done, and I will mention projects that I want to be really clear to anyone watching . So are not projects that necessarily needed additional zoning capacity but they are projects associated with religious organizations that we have previously funded at the office of housing.",244,,
1068,0.97,7456.315,7476.769,"For example, we have a long track record of funding compass housing alliance at places like Gethsemane Lutheran at South Lake Union which was a reconstruction of some of the space and extremely low income housing primarily at that location.",244,,
1069,0.97,7476.769,7488.047,We have worked in the University District with bellwether and now I'm Blanking on the church name and the University district.,244,,
1070,0.97,7488.047,7490.082,Maybe Councilmember Peterson can help me.,244,,
1071,0.97,7490.082,7496.288,That is a mixed income developments with 30-50% AMI and 60% AMI housing units.,244,,
1072,0.97,7496.288,7499.892,The Presbytery--Presbyterian Church.,245,,
1073,0.97,7499.892,7507.166,Thank you very much.,246,,
1074,0.97,7507.166,7516.408,"So I give those examples to show that in many cases, what we're doing is being responsive to the faith organizations and their ambitions and we are supporting them with subsidy.",246,,
1075,0.97,7516.408,7532.625,"In this case, 80% AMI gives some flexibility for religious organizations to examine what populations they might want to serve and then the subsidized process would may be drive that Affordability a little more deep.",246,,
1076,0.97,7532.625,7545.137,"I don't know, Nick, if you have anything to add from the analysis of the size and scale of opportunities that exist currently.",246,,
1077,0.97,7545.137,7546.438,Probably not much in detail.,247,,
1078,0.97,7546.438,7552.611,There is a wide range of size of sites on the zones in which they are located.,247,,
1079,0.97,7552.611,7567.226,"And of the ones that we have been engaged with, as Daniel described, have expressed some interest, most are in more of a multifamily or Mixed-Use context.",247,,
1080,0.97,7567.226,7573.265,And some of the eligible sites are in single-family as well.,247,,
1081,0.97,7573.265,7579.271,"Mr. chair, if I may ask one more follow-up of director Alvarado.",248,,
1082,0.97,7579.271,7579.572,Please.,249,,
1083,0.97,7579.572,7590.416,Your response now actually spurred another quick question.,250,,
1084,0.97,7590.416,7602.795,With this perhaps provide any additional incentive in addition to the fact that they would probably need to be subsidies for things to pencil out?,250,,
1085,0.97,7602.795,7606.999,"The supportive housing changes the past, does not provide an additional incentive that might not have existed previously?",250,,
1086,0.97,7606.999,7610.102,And how might that interact with this policy?,250,,
1087,0.97,7610.102,7622.181,Because that might even help a step further to Incentivize going at a lower AMI.,250,,
1088,0.97,7622.181,7623.415,That is a good question.,251,,
1089,0.97,7623.415,7642.134,"I tend to think that the more we make it simple, straightforward, cost-effective and predictable to develop, those taken together make it more likely that faith organizations would follow through on that mission to create affordable housing.",251,,
1090,0.97,7642.134,7653.045,Taken together when you are reducing barriers around design review or reducing barriers around pursuing contract Re- zones and instead having some capacity provided by the land use code.,251,,
1091,0.97,7653.045,7663.856,"When you have technical assistance, it makes it less complicated for religious organizations who might not be more regularly participating in the development process.",251,,
1092,0.97,7663.856,7695.087,"I do think they work together and in part, that is what shows that this is a partnership between the office of housing and Opcd and partnered PVC with Sdci for the development process and all these deferments working together and creating these efficiencies I think will maybe create more opportunity for people to want to engage in the development of the property.",251,,
1093,0.97,7695.087,7702.294,Thank you for answering all of my questions.,252,,
1094,0.97,7702.294,7705.097,I promise that I have no more.,252,,
1095,0.97,7705.097,7705.664,"Yielding back to you, Mr.",252,,
1096,0.97,7705.664,7705.898,Chair.,252,,
1097,0.97,7705.898,7706.799,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,253,,
1098,0.97,7706.799,7712.504,Any further questions at this time?,253,,
1099,0.97,7712.504,7722.414,Thank you Daniel and thank you Nick.,253,,
1100,0.97,7722.414,7725.784,Just want to thank you all.,253,,
1101,0.97,7725.784,7726.385,"And thank you, Ketil.",253,,
1102,0.97,7726.385,7728.287,A reminder to all colleagues to please get your ideas to Mr.,253,,
1103,0.97,7728.287,7735.694,Freeman as soon as possible so that we can have this as a smooth process.,253,,
1104,0.97,7735.694,7737.196,Thank you again for the introduction of the bill.,253,,
1105,0.97,7737.196,7743.235,We plan to hold this on the June 23rd meeting.,253,,
1106,0.97,7743.235,7762.755,"At that meeting, I plan to ask that we suspend the rules so that we are able to vote on the legislation on the same day that we have the public hearing in this advanced briefing will serve as one of two meetings that I like to have before passing legislation.",253,,
1107,0.97,7762.755,7765.491,"Are there any concerns at this time, colleagues about this plan?",253,,
1108,0.97,7765.491,7771.23,"See none, great.",254,,

1112,0.97,7779.872,7792.584,The three agenda items to close us out today are all updates to technical codes and we will consider them all together.,255,,
1113,0.97,7792.584,7797.156,Will you please read the abbreviated titles of all three bills into the record.,255,,
1114,0.97,7797.156,7809.134,"Agenda item five, counsel bill 120083, an ordinance related to Seattle's construction codes and ending with the Seattle building code and energy code and building code.",256,,
1115,0.97,7809.134,7820.913,"Bill, counsel bill 120084, an ordinance relating to land disturbing activity updating the grading code.",257,,
1116,0.97,7820.913,7829.721,"And agenda items 7120085, an ordinance related to boiler and steam engine operations.",258,,
1117,0.97,7829.721,7830.322,Thank you.,259,,
1118,0.97,7830.322,7845.003,"We have with us today Micah Chapelle, Steve FRASER and Ede Courtney who is unable to join us today.",259,,
1119,0.97,7845.003,7851.51,We want to thank her for her work on this legislation.,259,,
1120,0.97,7851.51,7858.116,"Sdci, will you please introduce yourself and refresh us on the proposal which we heard previously in Committee at the last meeting and then provide the presentation.",259,,
1121,0.97,7858.116,7868.327,Sure.,260,,
1122,0.97,7868.727,7870.963,I will be walking through the presentation.,260,,
1123,0.97,7870.963,7875.434,And remind committee members at these I believe are the last set of so-called construction codes accounts will be considering.,260,,
1124,0.97,7875.434,7882.341,And having to do with licensing and folks and operate the boilers and the steam engines.,260,,
1125,0.97,7882.341,7893.252,And I think this will be the last few and the Council will be set for the next several years until the next cycle of updates.,260,,
1126,0.97,7893.252,7899.091,It looks like Micah might be frozen.,261,,
1127,0.97,7899.091,7899.458,There you are.,261,,
1128,0.97,7899.458,7906.565,There we are.,262,,
1129,0.97,7906.565,7907.566,All right.,263,,
1130,0.97,7907.566,7909.501,Thank you very much.,263,,
1131,0.97,7909.501,7910.335,I am Micah Chapelle.,263,,
1132,0.97,7910.335,7914.306,I'm the technical code development manager for Sdci.,263,,
1133,0.97,7914.306,7916.141,We will walk you through a quick presentation.,263,,
1134,0.97,7916.141,7926.685,"I'm joined today by Steve Fraser, the chief boiler Inspector and Ede could not be here to participate today but I will cover anything for the grading code.",263,,
1135,0.97,7926.685,7927.119,Next slide please.,263,,
1136,0.97,7927.119,7942.501,"These changes are being Úproposed and presented by the Department of construction for purposes of helping people build a safe, livable and inclusive Seattle.",264,,
1137,0.97,7942.501,7946.571,"We are capturing that purpose by actively pursuing our values of equity, respect, quality, integrity and service.",264,,
1138,0.97,7946.571,7946.872,Next slide.,264,,
1139,0.97,7946.872,7968.961,Today we are going through these updates to the gradient code seen in here with boilers Operatorslicense law update and some Seattle construction codes.,265,,
1140,0.97,7968.961,7987.179,The intent of the grading code update is to align 2021 Seattle storm water code update that was just approved by use of city Council and necessary to comply with the Department of Ecology requirements and the clean water act.,266,,
1141,0.97,7987.179,7995.854,"Extensive outreach and public, and opportunities for the proposed update occur as part of the development process done for the 2021 clean water code.",266,,
1142,0.97,7995.854,7998.357,The comments were a journalist for the meetings.,266,,
1143,0.97,7998.357,8010.769,"Exchanges we will highlight today would include current threshold revisions, Verifications to definitions and modifications to some exceptions.",266,,
1144,0.97,8010.769,8011.103,Next slide.,266,,
1145,0.97,8011.103,8014.906,"At one point, the Stormwater grading code.",267,,
1146,0.97,8014.906,8022.914,"Separated and over time, the review thresholds shifted apart.",267,,
1147,0.97,8022.914,8024.683,"The update, it Realigns the review thresholds.",267,,
1148,0.97,8024.683,8035.527,"As you can see on the table, the land is serving the activity area in the 2016 stone water code with 750 square feet.",267,,
1149,0.97,8035.527,8037.129,That threshold is being increased too thousand square feet.,267,,
1150,0.97,8037.129,8048.807,"And then in the 2012 grading code, it was a threshold of 1 acre and that threshold is being reduced too thousand square feet with a land disturbing period.",267,,
1151,0.97,8048.807,8052.711,That will line both of those codes.,267,,
1152,0.97,8052.711,8079.337,"So the new replaced surface areas, was 2016 and 2021 storm water code at 750 square feet where the 2012 grading code was that 2000 square feet and you can see in the table that the 2021 threshold is being reduced to 750 square feet to align with the Stormwater code.",267,,
1153,0.97,8079.337,8080.072,Thank you.,268,,
1154,0.97,8080.072,8093.585,"Before we move on, I think this is just a great opportunity to demonstrate that these codes--code changes before us are to ensure that we are complying with State and Federal code.",268,,
1155,0.97,8093.585,8094.019,Is that correct?,268,,
1156,0.97,8094.019,8100.225,That is correct.,269,,
1157,0.97,8100.225,8107.165,"And that is what we are moving forward to, to align in the Department of Ecology requirement and clean water act Federal requirement.",269,,
1158,0.97,8107.165,8107.599,Thank you.,270,,
1159,0.97,8107.599,8130.622,"This slide clearly demonstrates to us that we are creating a uniformed code and by doing that, that means increased seeing the square footage in the Stormwater code drainage and making sure all are matched up.",270,,
1160,0.97,8130.622,8138.23,So I just wanted to point that out and highlight your good work.,270,,
1161,0.97,8138.23,8138.663,"Thank you, Micah.",270,,
1162,0.97,8138.663,8139.064,Thank you.,271,,
1163,0.97,8139.064,8139.464,Next slide.,272,,
1164,0.97,8139.464,8149.941,We are doing some Clarifications in the grading code and it is now being changed to the hard surface.,273,,
1165,0.97,8149.941,8152.511,That is to align with the Stormwater code.,273,,
1166,0.97,8152.511,8162.287,And then we are changing the potentially hazardous location to verify that it will include any State or Federal Database that includes areas of potential contamination.,273,,
1167,0.97,8162.287,8174.099,"On the slide, can you help me understand the difference in the definition between impervious surface and hard surface?",274,,
1168,0.97,8174.099,8174.533,Absolutely.,275,,
1169,0.97,8174.533,8178.537,"In 2019, Department of Ecology one to track all hard surfaces.",275,,
1170,0.97,8178.537,8186.745,So that definition and term was included in the 2016 Stormwater code.,275,,
1171,0.97,8186.745,8189.447,So changing hard surface in the grading code for this update will align the Stormwater code.,275,,
1172,0.97,8189.447,8197.689,"What that means is in a hard surface, and impervious surface is something water cannot get through.",275,,
1173,0.97,8197.689,8199.991,"But hard surface, actually water can get through that.",275,,
1174,0.97,8199.991,8207.766,"So he can think of and Pervious concrete, there is some that will drain water through it.",275,,
1175,0.97,8207.766,8210.902,So that is a hard surface but it is an impervious surface.,275,,
1176,0.97,8210.902,8214.773,So it wouldn't have been tracked and of the previous term.,275,,
1177,0.97,8214.773,8224.115,Will be are making sure that Tom will capture those types of surfaces that the Department of Ecology would like to identify.,275,,
1178,0.97,8224.115,8224.716,Okay.,276,,
1179,0.97,8224.716,8230.188,Thank you that was very helpful.,276,,
1180,0.97,8230.188,8252.544,And the last changes we will cover today for this grading code or modifications to some exemptions where new utility installations and environmentally critical areas for new Stormwater systems will no longer be exempt from the review of the permit.,277,,
1181,0.97,8252.544,8262.821,"Additionally, we removed the exemption for underground storage tank removal and replacement to align with the requirements of the Department of Ecology.",277,,
1182,0.97,8262.821,8265.023,Next slide.,278,,
1183,0.97,8265.023,8271.93,"We will get into what we have done for the storms--excuse me, the steam boiler and operator update.",278,,
1184,0.97,8271.93,8279.771,This ordinance was last updated in 2006 it was a little overdue.,278,,
1185,0.97,8279.771,8283.808,"In 2018, this application and issuance process was moved to the computer platform.",278,,
1186,0.97,8283.808,8293.451,What this did was required as to do a reordering of section 16.420.,278,,
1187,0.97,8293.451,8294.719,For 22 accurately capture the process.,278,,
1188,0.97,8294.719,8299.891,There was no real change there.,278,,
1189,0.97,8299.891,8303.995,Just fear his steps to modify and go along with that computer platform.,278,,
1190,0.97,8303.995,8311.302,"Additionally, the editorial changes for updating the current legislative format and switching to general language.",278,,
1191,0.97,8311.302,8318.109,Also we have created a direct Pathway for advancement to a grade one and grade two boiler supervisor.,278,,
1192,0.97,8318.109,8332.223,This legislation also modifies an existing table B in section 6.420.400 that correct mistakes that occurred in the 2006 update.,278,,
1193,0.97,8332.223,8334.592,All these changes were reviewed and approved by the steam license advisory board.,278,,
1194,0.97,8334.592,8334.893,Next slide.,278,,
1195,0.97,8334.893,8342.701,Those numbers are shown on the screen.,279,,
1196,0.97,8342.701,8343.435,Thank you.,280,,
1197,0.97,8343.435,8357.248,"If we can go back to that last slide briefly, there are a lot of technical changes included in this Densely packed slide.",280,,
1198,0.97,8357.248,8361.953,I just want to call this out as an example from you.,280,,
1199,0.97,8361.953,8364.489,You can share the direct path for advancement for boiler supervisors.,280,,
1200,0.97,8364.489,8366.291,What was the situation before and what have we changed it to now?,280,,
1201,0.97,8366.291,8368.96,Absolutely.,281,,
1202,0.97,8368.96,8382.841,"Previously, the language actually required an individual who is the supervisor to take a step back and certification for one year in order to take a step forward and certification.",281,,
1203,0.97,8382.841,8387.479,"So grade one, you have to step back to a different license.",281,,
1204,0.97,8387.479,8388.48,And now for one year.,281,,
1205,0.97,8388.48,8396.855,And now that clarifies that you don't have to take that step back and it is just a direct path from one step to the other.,281,,
1206,0.97,8396.855,8397.489,Thank you.,282,,
1207,0.97,8397.489,8402.56,"Steve, please jump in.",282,,
1208,0.97,8402.56,8403.661,Let me jump in.,283,,
1209,0.97,8403.661,8409.0,Grade one is actually the highest level of license.,283,,
1210,0.97,8409.0,8423.114,"So as an example for that, if you were a grade three boiler supervisor, to go to a grade two supervisor, you would have to take a step back from being a supervisor and become a regular grade two steam engineer for a year.",283,,
1211,0.97,8423.114,8430.422,That has two adverse impacts on the licensee's ability to maintain his job and income.,283,,
1212,0.97,8430.422,8441.933,The other is that it reduces the available boiler supervisors to assist boiler owners and operators with properly attending.,283,,
1213,0.97,8441.933,8442.634,Very helpful.,284,,
1214,0.97,8442.634,8444.435,And I believe that was the end of your presentation.,284,,
1215,0.97,8444.435,8444.836,Is that correct?,284,,
1216,0.97,8444.836,8446.738,We have one more slide.,285,,
1217,0.97,8446.738,8472.197,"The last thing we will cover today is the legislation clarifying some of the regulations adopting some amendments that are consistent with the Washington State and making some technical corrections from our emissions which include the table for the Seattle building code, various language.",286,,
1218,0.97,8472.197,8482.073,One of the items will be code reference sections and making sure those are correct.,286,,
1219,0.97,8482.073,8487.078,So that legislation is minor and hopefully we will not have too many more of those in the future.,286,,
1220,0.97,8487.078,8488.112,That will be all.,286,,
1221,0.97,8488.112,8488.413,Thank you.,286,,
1222,0.97,8488.413,8499.657,"Thank you . and again, thank you to Ede Courtney who could not be with us today and did a lot of really great work on us.",287,,
1223,0.97,8499.657,8504.162,"Colleagues, do you have questions?",287,,
1224,0.97,8504.162,8506.698,I know we had this before the committee and the last committee meeting.,287,,
1225,0.97,8506.698,8509.1,This is the second time before us.,287,,
1226,0.97,8509.1,8516.708,I know it is dense and exciting information.,287,,
1227,0.97,8516.708,8519.41,"Councilmember Pedersen, he questions?",288,,
1228,0.97,8519.41,8519.911,Seeing none.,288,,
1229,0.97,8519.911,8520.745,"Councilmember Lewis, any questions?",288,,
1230,0.97,8520.745,8522.28,No Mr. chair.,289,,
1231,0.97,8522.28,8523.248,Thank you.,289,,
1232,0.97,8523.248,8524.916,Thank you.,290,,
1233,0.97,8524.916,8533.424,"I spent probably about an hour and a half or more with Micah, Stephen Ede, getting into the details of this.",290,,
1234,0.97,8533.424,8534.559,And it was very interesting.,290,,
1235,0.97,8534.559,8537.395,Although I don't know that we need to go into that now.,290,,
1236,0.97,8537.395,8549.24,"I guess my only question is, is your background still like Pender Ray or is it a new background?",290,,
1237,0.97,8549.24,8550.241,That is a new background.,291,,
1238,0.97,8550.241,8552.644,That is in Yellowstone National Park after doing some Flyfishing.,291,,
1239,0.97,8552.644,8559.35,You have good travels.,292,,
1240,0.97,8559.35,8561.452,I would love to come with you next time.,292,,

1244,0.97,8566.057,8569.093,"Steve, I assume that is Smt in your background?",295,,
1245,0.97,8569.093,8575.333,It is.,296,,
