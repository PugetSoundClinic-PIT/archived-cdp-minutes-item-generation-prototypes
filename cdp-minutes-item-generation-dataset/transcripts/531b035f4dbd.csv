24,0.97,69.769,79.379,I want to thank everybody for looking at your schedules and taking into consideration whether or not we needed to have a afternoon meeting this afternoon.,19,,
25,0.97,79.379,84.951,No one registered any objection to the cancellation so we went ahead and canceled that meeting.,19,,
26,0.97,84.951,89.789,"So, the next city council meeting will be next Monday, November 1ST, at 2:00.",19,,

28,0.97,102.869,109.576,"We will be extending that Telework policy through January 19th, 2022.",20,,
29,0.97,109.576,131.397,"This decision in my mind seems very necessary when looking at both the current state of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic from the public health and practical, but also there were practical perspectives related to the transition from my office as being the current Council President to Whomever the next Council President is going to be.",20,,
30,0.97,131.397,145.445,And wanted to be respectful of the reality that they would need to be a transition period there in order for the new Council President to evaluate ongoing policies related to Telework in compliance with Covid-19.,20,,
31,0.97,145.445,146.88,And public health implications.,20,,
32,0.97,146.88,163.463,"So, keep an eye out for that communication from me to the entire legislative Department for more information of course as always I'm grateful to you as my staff to talk about any aspects related to that communication.",20,,
33,0.97,163.463,175.041,"With that being said, I'm going to go ahead and dig into the preview of today's city council actions, Council and regional committees.",21,,
34,0.97,175.041,182.048,I imagine this session will probably go quickly since we don't have committee meetings at the time.,21,,
35,0.97,182.048,192.659,"So today's order is going to be Councilmember Lewis, Morales, Mosqueda, Pedersen, Sawant, Strauss, Herbold, Juarez, and then I will conclude.",21,,

38,0.97,197.397,209.776,I'm going to have office hours this Friday obviously I don't have any IMS on this afternoon's agenda since we don't have a meeting today.,22,,
39,0.97,209.776,226.826,"The only other thing I want to do is give a brief shout out of deep appreciation to all of our employees at Seattle city light who are out there doing incredibly difficult work under very difficult circumstances in the wake of the very, very stormy weather we have experienced over the weekend.",22,,
40,0.97,226.826,230.93,That have left so many of our neighbors without power.,22,,
41,0.97,230.93,236.903,I myself was without power for most of yesterday.,22,,
42,0.97,236.903,242.241,"Having gone out yesterday afternoon, and was restored later yesterday evening.",22,,
43,0.97,242.241,244.444,I count myself very fortunate.,22,,
44,0.97,244.444,249.248,I know thousands of my neighbors are still without power.,22,,
45,0.97,249.248,257.957,But my do just want to say that my dad worked for Seattle city light for 31 years out there on utility crews.,22,,
46,0.97,257.957,263.73,I remember him getting up at 1:00 in the morning because of storms.,22,,
47,0.97,263.73,269.035,"It had created a power outage and going out into the dark, patrolling the areas with downed power lines.",22,,
48,0.97,269.035,272.138,"Clearing those spaces, running new cables.",22,,
49,0.97,272.138,278.478,"Getting power back Online to the people of this city, in a quick and efficient way that our utility is famous for.",22,,
50,0.97,278.478,282.682,I really want to lift up that work of everyone in local 77.,22,,
51,0.97,282.682,284.384,46.,22,,
52,0.97,284.384,292.592,"All of our electrical workers that make up the city family, the work you are doing is heroic.",22,,
53,0.97,292.592,311.711,"To those of you out there who have not yet had your power restored, I know that our city employees are diligently working to do it, and just want to lift up and make it known that we appreciate your work and that this is a critical city service that we are really putting our shoulder into.",22,,
54,0.97,311.711,314.414,"So with that, Madam President I don't actually have anything else to report.",22,,
55,0.97,314.414,320.987,I will save Previewing my CBA's for those actual sessions this week in the interest of time.,22,,
56,0.97,320.987,331.23,Look forward to a special Land- use committee meeting later this morning if I'm not mistaken.,22,,
57,0.97,331.23,334.133,I'm sure Councilmember Strauss will clarify in his report if that is indeed the case.,22,,
58,0.97,334.133,335.201,"So, thank you.",22,,
59,0.97,335.201,339.238,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Lewis.",23,,
60,0.97,339.238,341.307,"You are correct, the committee will convene at 10:30 A.M.",23,,
61,0.97,341.307,348.614,Or as soon thereafter as we conclude our Council briefing this morning.,23,,
62,0.97,348.614,351.651,"So, I'm sure Councilmember Strauss will have more to add.",23,,
63,0.97,351.651,353.786,"Okay, any comments or questions on that report?",23,,
64,0.97,353.786,357.423,"Hearing none, we will keep going down the line.",24,,
65,0.97,357.423,360.727,"Next up is Councilmember Morales, and then Councilmember Mosqueda.",24,,

67,0.97,361.394,365.164,"Good morning, thank you.",25,,
68,0.97,365.164,370.536,"I do just want to clarify, I understand that we have executive session this morning, is that correct?",25,,
69,0.97,370.536,376.976,Council briefing will officially adjourn until after we conclude our executive session.,26,,
70,0.97,376.976,378.077,Okay.,27,,
71,0.97,378.077,380.58,"Okay, so good morning everyone.",27,,
72,0.97,380.58,385.184,I have nothing on this afternoon's agenda since we don't have a meeting.,27,,
73,0.97,385.184,389.188,Last week I attended the board of health meeting.,27,,
74,0.97,389.188,392.658,There was several updates that we had.,27,,
75,0.97,392.658,396.362,We also had a presentation on Gender-Based violence.,27,,
76,0.97,396.362,402.702,We heard from Mary Ellen stone from King County sexual assault resource center.,27,,
77,0.97,402.702,409.308,Merrill peasant from coalition ending violence who we also heard from here last week.,27,,
78,0.97,409.308,413.913,And Abigail who directs the urban Indian health Institute.,27,,
79,0.97,413.913,427.794,"They were presenting on the pandemic's impact on survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence and their families, as well as on the impact on the organizations that assist them.",27,,
80,0.97,427.794,437.904,"So, just briefly, they indicated that some of the impacts on survivors include exacerbated trauma and mental health crises.",27,,
81,0.97,437.904,453.452,"Increased vulnerability for children for whom securing protection has become more difficult, as well as increased stress among survivors, and as we know, the community at large.",27,,
82,0.97,453.452,471.237,"So, it was an opportunity for the board of health to hear about the impacts, and really just highlighted the programs that serve survivors and their families really are struggling right now with capacity issues and resource issues, and are looking to us for increased support.",27,,
83,0.97,471.237,478.044,We also had a discussion about a proposal to repeal the bicycle helmet law.,27,,
84,0.97,478.044,492.859,The issue arose after research last year found that black cyclists received by goal helmet related Infractions at a rate 3.8 times higher than white cyclists.,27,,
85,0.97,492.859,498.397,"For native American and native Americans, the rate was 2.2 times higher.",27,,
86,0.97,498.397,506.005,"So, we know that there is a disparate enforcement of this law, so that has led the board to have a conversation.",27,,
87,0.97,506.005,511.31,We did have a robust debate about whether to repeal.,27,,
88,0.97,511.31,517.817,I believe there is consensus among the board of health members that the law is applied in a Biased way.,27,,
89,0.97,517.817,526.525,"Nevertheless, the chair did landed to delay the vote until next month because there was concern about whether there was an alternative to repealing.",27,,
90,0.97,526.525,528.394,That could be considered.,27,,
91,0.97,528.394,533.232,Still keep the law on the books.,27,,
92,0.97,533.232,545.011,"So, several of us were advocating for repeal of the law, but I think we are going to have a little bit more discussion, and the plan at this point is to vote next time six months.",27,,
93,0.97,545.011,548.114,Director Dennis did not give his report because the meeting was running kind of long.,27,,
94,0.97,548.114,549.949,He will be sending a written update to folks.,27,,
95,0.97,549.949,558.758,"But I did connect with him afterwards to get an update on the news about the vaccine Rollout for children, Covid-19 vaccine Rollout for children 5 to 11.",27,,
96,0.97,558.758,571.27,"As we've all heard over the weekend, the FDA is reviewing, and the expectation is that tomorrow, the Pfizer vaccine for children 5 to 11 will be approved.",27,,
97,0.97,571.27,581.581,The process is that the CDC then will review and approve and the expectation is the whole process will be completed in early November.,27,,
98,0.97,581.581,590.456,One thing that the director shared with me is that the Biden administration has prepared enough vaccine for King County to cover all of our 28 million children.,27,,
99,0.97,590.456,597.763,"They will begin shipments later this week, so that as the approval process wraps up, we will already have vaccine here.",27,,
100,0.97,597.763,607.006,Public health has already matched any of the schools with a vaccination provider to help with School-Based administration.,27,,
101,0.97,607.006,611.711,As well as getting primary and Pediatric providers geared up and ready to go.,27,,
102,0.97,611.711,619.318,"So, it sounds like you're in King County we will be ready on day one of the final approval to start rolling that out.",27,,
103,0.97,619.318,625.925,This week I will continue the week without driving challenge from the disability rights Washington.,27,,
104,0.97,625.925,634.133,This stormy weather has certainly been a perfect backdrop to the event Showcasing the perils for people who have to walk or roll or bike.,27,,
105,0.97,634.133,642.742,"We have seen wet leaves, which we know can be a hazard for people who walk or use Wheelchairs, or bike over them.",27,,
106,0.97,642.742,653.819,"Strong winds and topple trees, and we understand that we lost two members of our Washington community this weekend to a toppled tree.",27,,
107,0.97,653.819,662.028,And heavy rain of course can be a hazard similar to wet leaves and LOWERS visibility to everyone on the road.,27,,
108,0.97,662.028,664.063,I want to thank disability rights Washington for hosting the event.,27,,
109,0.97,664.063,674.173,"The elected leaders who have already signed up, transportation officials who are already seeing firsthand where our infrastructure is failing people who cannot drive.",27,,
110,0.97,674.173,684.65,"Hopefully this will eliminate the need for improvements, like more home zones, sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and better transit for everyone.",27,,
111,0.97,684.65,686.986,"That is all I have this morning, colleagues.",27,,
112,0.97,686.986,692.191,Thank you.,28,,
113,0.97,692.191,694.894,"Excuse me, thank you so much, Councilmember Morales.",28,,
114,0.97,694.894,696.629,Any comments or questions on that report?,28,,
115,0.97,696.629,700.666,"Hearing none, we will keep going.",29,,
116,0.97,700.666,702.735,"Next up is Councilmember Mosqueda, and then Councilmember Pedersen.",29,,
117,0.97,702.735,703.636,Good morning.,29,,
118,0.97,703.636,710.109,"Good morning, Council President.",30,,
119,0.97,710.109,714.88,I just want to say thank you Council president for your leadership and the work you have done throughout this time of Covid.,30,,
120,0.97,714.88,718.818,It has been no easy task to be our fearless leader for the Council in this time of Covid.,30,,
121,0.97,718.818,722.521,Just want to thank you for the extension of the Stay-At-Home order.,30,,
122,0.97,722.521,730.329,"I think that helps to protect the health and safety, not only of our team members, but for the entire public, and it helps lead by example for other employers as well.",30,,
123,0.97,730.329,743.008,"So, thanks for taking those steps and to set us up for health and well-being for our team and for our families, especially as we head into the holidays when we are more likely to see people.",30,,
124,0.97,743.008,744.243,That helps preserve the public's health.,30,,
125,0.97,744.243,746.312,"So, thanks for that news.",30,,
126,0.97,746.312,754.32,"Colleagues, I wanted to follow up with a information for our upcoming select budget committee meeting.",30,,
127,0.97,754.32,761.26,"As you all know, there is no Finance and housing committee meetings at this time, but we are all deep into this select budget committee meeting.",30,,
128,0.97,761.26,763.929,I want to thank you for your participation in these discussions.,30,,
129,0.97,763.929,766.031,We are headed into week five of eight.,30,,
130,0.97,766.031,774.44,You will soon be receiving a memo from my office to summarize what to expect this weekend what to expect in the upcoming weeks.,30,,
131,0.97,774.44,777.443,Thank you for submitting all of your amendments on time last week.,30,,
132,0.97,777.443,782.181,"We received nearly 200 amendments, colleagues.",30,,
133,0.97,782.181,786.552,That would include folks who have given us a heads up that they are planning to walk on a handful of amendments.,30,,
134,0.97,786.552,788.287,The total amendments that were submitted.,30,,
135,0.97,788.287,804.436,This process and your submissions with two additional Councilmembers onto each of the CBA's that were submitted on time gives central staff enough time to drop those amendments and allows us to have robust discussion in our select budget committee meetings.,30,,
136,0.97,804.436,808.507,Those select budget committee meetings that will focus on the amendments start tomorrow.,30,,
137,0.97,808.507,812.611,"We have all day sessions Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday this week.",30,,
138,0.97,812.611,817.917,"Again, a reminder we start at 9:30 a.m., 30 minutes of public testimony.",30,,

140,0.97,821.187,826.325,We will then have a Recess from 1:00 P.M.,30,,
141,0.97,826.325,826.992,To 2:00 P.M.,30,,
142,0.97,826.992,828.027,And conclude by 5:00 P.M.,30,,
143,0.97,828.027,828.427,Each day.,30,,
144,0.97,828.427,833.465,This is an opportunity for us to discuss those amendments that central staff has worked with you to finalize.,30,,
145,0.97,833.465,845.845,"Again, the central staff is finalizing these amendments on a rolling basis, so that we are Prioritizing those that need to be published today for our Tuesday committee presentation.",30,,

147,0.97,852.618,856.355,"For the committee meeting on Thursday, you see those published on Wednesday.",30,,
148,0.97,856.355,867.666,This approach ensures that Councilmembers receive the necessary and factual description by allowing central staff to craft the amendments and make sure that all of the information is factual.,30,,
149,0.97,867.666,880.746,"This is going to be a document that is owned by central staff, but of course you as Councilmembers get the final chance to review the amendment before publication to confirm if there is anything that needs to be changed from a factual nature.",30,,
150,0.97,880.746,898.597,"While the central staff amendments are there is, and their documents, from a nonpartisan and Non-Office specific perspective, during the committee, you Councilmembers, of course have the chance to provide additional information.",30,,
151,0.97,898.597,906.805,There is a chance for you to provide information about any of your budget proposal to help us understand the why you have asked for something that is either an increase or decrease.,30,,
152,0.97,906.805,917.683,"This is your opportunity to provide a description, the central staff amendment then can go hand in hand with that description.",30,,
153,0.97,917.683,920.686,"But, your materials may also be distributed to the committee separately.",30,,
154,0.97,920.686,925.324,And they can be added to the legislative record after the committee meeting.,30,,
155,0.97,925.324,935.734,"For example in the past, I have shown charts, you know I love charts and pie charts, so if you have any sort of data that you would like to provide, you're welcome to do that.",30,,
156,0.97,935.734,938.437,That will be part of the legislative record after the committee.,30,,
157,0.97,938.437,949.715,"To share additional information in advance, please compile the information into a single Pdf document and include it in the header or title of the document, that this is supplemental information for the budget.",30,,
158,0.97,949.715,960.993,The budget amendment number should be listed on your document so that it is very clear that your supplemental information is from your office and corresponds with what the central staff have created.,30,,
159,0.97,960.993,976.475,"Allie sent this information and her central staff Email to all of you late last week, and we will be reiterating the process for including the information in advance for your colleagues in the memo that we are sending out here momentarily today.",30,,
160,0.97,976.475,985.951,"The document that we are talking about, if you do have any additional factual information that you would like to send that, again corresponds with what central staff has created.",30,,
161,0.97,985.951,989.288,Please make sure that you're distributing it the day before the committee discussion.,30,,
162,0.97,989.288,1001.2,"Please make sure the amendment is Emailed to all committee members and all Councilmembers, including director handy, Alex Canoochee, and Patty Morgan.",30,,
163,0.97,1001.2,1002.468,And the deputy clerk's offices.,30,,
164,0.97,1002.468,1006.772,"Again, I want to make sure you know this information is going to be sent to you in a memo as well.",30,,
165,0.97,1006.772,1015.514,"Early heads up that if you do have additional corresponding information, or Fax you would like to share about your amendment that you will be discussing, we will have the chance to have you do that tomorrow.",30,,
166,0.97,1015.514,1022.888,"Excuse me, we will have the chance to send this to you later today in the memo that we are sending.",30,,
167,0.97,1022.888,1039.004,"I do want to also note that with nearly 200 amendments, colleagues, the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday meetings are not an opportunity for you to show your support as a personal Councilmember for each of those amendments.",30,,
168,0.97,1039.004,1048.947,"Please, please Reserve adding your name to an additional budget amendment for only the very few items that you really must have your name on.",30,,
169,0.97,1048.947,1063.362,"It is not imperative that we have five, six, seven, eight, or nine Councilmembers on a CBA for it to be included in the chair's proposal.",30,,
170,0.97,1063.362,1073.272,It is only important for you to have gotten those two additional cosponsors so that we could have the amendments fully Vetted and prepared for tomorrow.,30,,
171,0.97,1073.272,1087.753,"There will be a handful of walk on amendments over the next few days as well, but please reserve the signing on of additional amendments this year just for very few.",30,,
172,0.97,1087.753,1088.887,Given the high number of amendments.,30,,
173,0.97,1088.887,1100.299,"I know for all of you who have been engaged in this work last year, remotely and through our colleagues before, the last two years, it was customary to sort of raise your hand and indicate if you support something.",30,,
174,0.97,1100.299,1104.169,"But, given the high number of amendments this year, please be very conservative and where you raise your hand.",30,,
175,0.97,1104.169,1112.211,Because it is not going to be necessarily helpful for me to sift through all 200 amendments if a single Councilmember is signing onto them.,30,,
176,0.97,1112.211,1125.524,"Again, the number of colleagues signing onto an amendment does not equal inclusion in the Council's draft proposed budget that you all will be receiving his soon.",30,,
177,0.97,1125.524,1132.297,"So, I will make sure to reiterate that tomorrow, but I do want to make sure that members of the public know, there's a lot of shared support.",30,,
178,0.97,1132.297,1136.001,A lot of shared priorities across the Council.,30,,
179,0.97,1136.001,1141.206,"If Councilmembers are not raising their hand to sign onto an amendment, that is not an indication of Nonsupport.",30,,
180,0.97,1141.206,1148.347,It is really an effort to try to be very conservative and adding your names to any additional amendments at this juncture.,30,,
181,0.97,1148.347,1152.251,"So, we will make sure to reiterate that for all of you again tomorrow Wednesday and Thursday.",30,,
182,0.97,1152.251,1156.655,But we will not have the process of having a screen to show Sign-On's.,30,,
183,0.97,1156.655,1164.763,I will go through that if there is any verbal additional Sign- on's we will make sure to note that in the meeting.,30,,
184,0.97,1164.763,1171.069,"But, thank you for your work in advance to be very conservative about adding your name to any additional Council budget amendments at this point.",30,,
185,0.97,1171.069,1173.372,Just a very quick reminder of the committee process.,30,,
186,0.97,1173.372,1179.344,"Our Committee on today, October 26th will start with public comments.",30,,
187,0.97,1179.344,1193.292,"We will then have a packed agenda that will include Finance general, FAS, Department of the Legislature, the Mayor's office budget, the city auditor's office budget, Seattle information technology budget.",30,,
188,0.97,1193.292,1195.994,Seattle public utilities.,30,,

195,0.97,1211.41,1213.579,Office of economic development in the office of labor standards.,30,,
196,0.97,1213.579,1217.916,We will be grouping all of these presentations into certain categories.,30,,
197,0.97,1217.916,1225.424,"For example, workforce and economic development, arts and culture, and thriving communities.",30,,
198,0.97,1225.424,1235.133,"For, you will have a chance to see all of the departments sort of categorized so it's an easy conversation to follow.",30,,
199,0.97,1235.133,1239.238,"But, there will be a lot of material, so each day you will get a packet of information from Patty.",30,,
200,0.97,1239.238,1241.306,"Thank you in advance, Patty.",30,,
201,0.97,1241.306,1244.743,That summarizes all the great work from central staff.,30,,
202,0.97,1244.743,1248.847,That packet will provide you the information you need for the following day.,30,,
203,0.97,1248.847,1265.43,"So again today, Monday, you will see the information ready for our Tuesday meeting and encourage you to set aside some time later in the afternoon, or if you need to in the evening, to review the proposed packet so that we can all walk into each of those meetings very well briefed on the amendments that each Councilmember is bringing forward.",30,,
204,0.97,1265.43,1268.634,"Thank you, colleagues.",30,,
205,0.97,1268.634,1270.669,I will remind us of the process again tomorrow.,30,,
206,0.97,1270.669,1280.078,Make sure that you have a clear understanding of what to expect throughout the day and we will make this a very seamless process.,30,,
207,0.97,1280.078,1291.79,"Thank you all for your ongoing work as I think we have a record number of budget bills in the last two years, given our work on Jumpstart, Covid relief and deploying Federal relief dollars from the American rescue plan act as well.",30,,
208,0.97,1291.79,1293.792,"So, thank you again as we head into this process.",30,,
209,0.97,1293.792,1295.694,"Thank you, Council President.",30,,
210,0.97,1295.694,1297.496,Thank you so much.,31,,
211,0.97,1297.496,1300.599,Any comments or questions on that report?,31,,
212,0.97,1300.599,1305.27,We will all be spending lots of time together this week as we go through the select budget committee process.,31,,
213,0.97,1305.27,1311.209,"So, thanks to our good chair for setting up the process and shepherding us through it.",31,,
214,0.97,1311.209,1312.511,Okay.,32,,
215,0.97,1312.511,1316.882,So next up I think it is Councilmember Pedersen.,32,,
216,0.97,1316.882,1321.019,"Then, after that, Councilmember Sawant.",32,,
217,0.97,1321.019,1321.42,Good morning.,32,,
218,0.97,1321.42,1323.522,Good morning.,33,,
219,0.97,1323.522,1331.029,Of course no full city council today so no items from our committee.,33,,
220,0.97,1331.029,1336.635,But from our committee will meet on December 1ST and on December 15th.,33,,
221,0.97,1336.635,1340.105,That is the transportation and utilities committee will meet 9:30 in the morning on those two days.,33,,
222,0.97,1340.105,1348.747,"And district 4 and throughout the city and our region, obviously yesterday's severe windstorm brought down many Powerlines.",33,,
223,0.97,1348.747,1357.456,Want to join my colleagues in thanking the front line crews of Seattle city light for working through the night to restore power to thousands of customers.,33,,
224,0.97,1357.456,1364.029,Also to our fire Department who is out there for any of those downed wires that are causing electrical fires.,33,,
225,0.97,1364.029,1369.968,"As I understand it, just within the city of Seattle, there were 44,000 customers out of power yesterday.",33,,
226,0.97,1369.968,1374.639,Of course even a larger number for the Puget sound region that we have seen reported in the media.,33,,
227,0.97,1374.639,1382.28,"Seattle city light is reporting in the city of Seattle city limits, they are down to about 3000.",33,,
228,0.97,1382.28,1391.189,"The audit map shows a higher number, but it's amazing progress they have made from 44,000 down to 3000.",33,,
229,0.97,1391.189,1401.5,If you do experiencing new power outage call 206-684-3000 and press one you can also go Online and look at the audit map.,33,,
230,0.97,1401.5,1413.512,We know people are suffering without power and crews are continuing work as quickly as they can from city light.,33,,
231,0.97,1413.512,1422.053,"The storm and our response to it is just another reminder that the vital basics of city government, such as electrical power, clean water, clear roadways, and the need to maintain our basic infrastructure keep us safe and our economy moving.",33,,
232,0.97,1422.053,1422.888,That concludes my report.,33,,
233,0.97,1422.888,1424.689,Thank you.,33,,
234,0.97,1424.689,1428.426,Short and sweet.,34,,
235,0.97,1428.426,1429.261,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",34,,
236,0.97,1429.261,1430.695,Any comments or questions?,34,,
237,0.97,1430.695,1436.535,I'm not seeing any hands raised.,35,,
238,0.97,1436.535,1438.436,Of course we would head down now to Councilmember Sawant.,35,,
239,0.97,1438.436,1440.105,After that will be Councilmember Strauss.,35,,
240,0.97,1440.105,1440.439,Good morning.,35,,
241,0.97,1440.439,1445.043,Good morning.,36,,
242,0.97,1445.043,1450.816,The next meeting of the Sustainability and Renters' rights Committee is scheduled for November 30th at 2:00 P.M.,36,,
243,0.97,1450.816,1453.718,As I have mentioned in the briefing sessions Deviously.,36,,
244,0.97,1453.718,1469.134,We will be discussing the rent control legislation and possibly a legislation related to the city of Seattle divesting from financial institutions who are investing in fossil fuel pipelines.,36,,
245,0.97,1469.134,1480.045,"My office and the central staff members are working on developing that legislation right now, and I will keep the city council updated on its progress.",36,,
246,0.97,1480.045,1491.49,"My office has recently been contacted by several Renters at Ranier court, which is a group of buildings near the mt . Baker neighborhood owned by Southeast effective development.",36,,
247,0.97,1491.49,1496.494,And managed by Coast property management company.,36,,
248,0.97,1496.494,1505.77,The Renters in these buildings have struggled in vain for years to get their owners and property managers of their buildings to address their concerns.,36,,
249,0.97,1505.77,1510.675,These Renters are working people who make our city run.,36,,
250,0.97,1510.675,1512.11,"They are seniors, they are families with children.",36,,
251,0.97,1512.11,1519.117,Many of them belong to immigrant communities and communities of color.,36,,
252,0.97,1519.117,1532.497,"The vast majority of Renters are of low income, and are eligible for a systems under the section 8. they have attempted for years to address pervasive problems in the apartments such as lack of heating.",36,,
253,0.97,1532.497,1534.633,"In some cases, years of lack of heating.",36,,
254,0.97,1534.633,1539.037,"Mold, Bedbugs and Cockroach and bike station.",36,,
255,0.97,1539.037,1542.54,Hallways with accumulating garbage.,36,,
256,0.97,1542.54,1545.61,The absence of Internet access for low income residents.,36,,
257,0.97,1545.61,1546.845,Broken stoves and refrigerators.,36,,
258,0.97,1546.845,1551.216,Nonfunctioning toilets and leaking ceilings.,36,,
259,0.97,1551.216,1554.819,For many of the Renters the daily reality of living in these buildings has been a nightmare.,36,,
260,0.97,1554.819,1555.754,Not only have both S.E.E.D.,36,,
261,0.97,1555.754,1569.534,"And the other group failed to address numerous problems and violations, many of them extreme, they have also set rent increase notices of $100 to most of their tenets in the last week.",36,,
262,0.97,1569.534,1571.369,Which is absolutely unacceptable.,36,,
263,0.97,1571.369,1575.674,My office has held community meetings with the tenants.,36,,
264,0.97,1575.674,1591.656,"We have collected all their complaints on the code violations and working with them, we have submitted their housing code violations to the city of Seattle Department of construction and inspection.",36,,
265,0.97,1591.656,1597.662,Some of the tenants I believe had already submitted some of their complaints before my office got involved.,36,,
266,0.97,1597.662,1601.766,I really think that was important as well.,36,,
267,0.97,1601.766,1609.607,My office has also contacted the Department of construction and inspections to alert them to this and we will be of course in constant communication with them.,36,,
268,0.97,1609.607,1616.982,This is very much the kind of work that my office has done with the Chateau building in the central district.,36,,
269,0.97,1616.982,1620.819,Councilmembers willfully remember that those tenants were also in a similar situation.,36,,
270,0.97,1620.819,1622.821,Many of them immigrants are people of color community members.,36,,
271,0.97,1622.821,1623.989,Many of them seniors.,36,,
272,0.97,1623.989,1626.691,Many of them low income.,36,,
273,0.97,1626.691,1637.736,"They courageously got organized alongside my office, alongside tenant Union Seattle and Progressive labor unions.",36,,
274,0.97,1637.736,1648.246,Together our struggle was able to win serious victories that were practically unheard of going against a cadence which is a property corporation.,36,,
275,0.97,1648.246,1657.655,Our hope is that the tenants here will also get organized in a similar fashion and certainly the desire to make change is high among the tenants.,36,,
276,0.97,1657.655,1672.771,"I'm not sure if Councilmembers watched this, but if you haven't, please watch the Komo news story that was played I think Thursday night.",36,,
277,0.97,1672.771,1675.073,On the nightly news.,36,,
278,0.97,1675.073,1692.09,It showed clearly how the tenants are fighting back and also how egregious it is that the landlords have sent $100 rent increase notices in the midst of these deplorable conditions that the tenants have been faced with.,36,,
279,0.97,1692.09,1701.766,And ordinance by my office and approved by the city council in 2016 prohibits rent increases at buildings with serious housing code violations.,36,,
280,0.97,1701.766,1710.375,That ordinance was named the Carl Haglund law flowing from a brilliant struggle in the autumn of 1915.,36,,
281,0.97,1710.375,1714.479,The year before in district 2 on Ranier Avenue.,36,,
282,0.97,1714.479,1730.328,"My office alongside then Councilmember, the tenant Union, and other progressive housing advocates in the city, we stood with the tenants and it was another crucial struggle that yielded real victories for the tenants.",36,,
283,0.97,1730.328,1741.606,"And Infamously exploited landlord attempted to raise the rent for tenants in this building, again with terrible housing code violations.",36,,
284,0.97,1741.606,1750.281,"The Renters organized, and through that struggle, the tenants forced him to eliminate the rent increases he had previously sent, and forced them to address many of the violations.",36,,
285,0.97,1750.281,1755.753,"Then, as I said in 2016, the year after we won the law.",36,,
286,0.97,1755.753,1766.831,The tenants here in the Ranier court building have also set up a series of concrete demands on S.E.E.D.,36,,
287,0.97,1766.831,1771.369,And coast.,36,,
288,0.97,1771.369,1775.273,Obviously demanding they address the problems but also demanding that there are no rent increases.,36,,
289,0.97,1775.273,1782.747,"There also demanding an end to the discrimination that they have faced on a systematic basis based on race, nationality, language or otherwise.",36,,
290,0.97,1782.747,1797.962,"There also demanding sufficient staff to address the concerns, and one of the most important demands they have is to approve access for tenants to install affordable Internet hookups in units.",36,,
291,0.97,1797.962,1815.713,"In fact, I have personally just in the last few days spoken to field technicians in lumen who are also members of the Cwa--communication workers of America Union, in the Seattle region.",36,,
292,0.97,1815.713,1821.019,They do exactly this kind of work and they are excited about helping set up Internet for these buildings as well.,36,,
293,0.97,1821.019,1822.921,The bottleneck and the obstacle has been S.E.E.D.,36,,
294,0.97,1822.921,1827.625,And coast have refused to allow that to happen.,36,,
295,0.97,1827.625,1835.733,The low income residents have been without Internet low Internet--low cost Internet access since 2017.,36,,
296,0.97,1835.733,1848.746,"This is obviously especially problematic in the middle of a pandemic when our community members, working people, have relied on the Internet like never before.",36,,
297,0.97,1848.746,1851.95,It is part of a very important struggle.,36,,
298,0.97,1851.95,1856.521,"We will be working on it with the tenants, alongside the tenants, and we will be announcing upcoming actions.",36,,
299,0.97,1856.521,1860.458,Thank you.,36,,

416,0.97,2571.869,2578.809,Often when we hear the words domestic violence we are often thinking exclusively of partner violence.,42,,
417,0.97,2578.809,2591.956,Southwest precinct captain Grossman had told me that he has noticed an increase of parent to student violence in the home.,42,,
418,0.97,2591.956,2603.0,It's also linking this increase to the impacts of social isolation over the last year and a half.,42,,

423,0.97,2662.159,2672.836,Rather than just sort of focusing on the values that the parking lots in the past have brought to that business district.,42,,
424,0.97,2672.836,2688.585,"But, looking forward to how bringing more people to live in the junction will also increase foot traffic and make a stronger business community.",42,,
425,0.97,2688.585,2694.792,And of course address a big need that we have in West Seattle for affordable housing.,42,,
