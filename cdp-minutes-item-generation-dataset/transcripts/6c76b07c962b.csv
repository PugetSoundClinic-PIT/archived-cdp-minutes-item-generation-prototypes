13,0.97,52.986,64.03,"While I recognize that we're still dealing with the pandemic, front line workers have been on the job, in person, keeping city government and the city as a whole running.",7,,
14,0.97,64.03,83.716,"And we're public servants, and I believe that the public is best served with In-Person meetings, because they facilitate a clear meeting and the public can see our interactions.",7,,
15,0.97,83.716,92.792,"If I don't see you on the screen, please just speak out.",7,,
16,0.97,92.792,98.932,"Let's see, public meetings are also important in person, because reporters get immediate access.",7,,

25,0.97,180.046,185.785,Seattle city light and utilities will not call customers to demand personal information.,7,,
26,0.97,185.785,196.896,"If someone calls demanding payment, rather than working with you to establish a payment plan, that is a scam.",7,,
27,0.97,196.896,203.503,Customers who believe they've been called by a Scammer should call to verify their account.,7,,

71,0.97,496.162,502.702,Washington wild spends nearly all its efforts working on issues in Washington state.,14,,
72,0.97,502.702,509.308,But logging and threats from the Skagit River would impact salmon and Orca recovery.,14,,

101,0.97,683.215,685.451,Can we please pause for a moment?,19,,
102,0.97,685.451,689.455,I'm not seeing the presentation on my zoom window.,19,,
103,0.97,689.455,692.992,Can the public see it?,19,,

105,0.97,705.805,708.941,Okay.,21,,
106,0.97,708.941,711.31,"There we go, thank you.",21,,
107,0.97,711.31,713.979,"Sorry, please continue.",21,,
108,0.97,713.979,714.346,Next slide.,22,,
109,0.97,714.346,718.584,So today I'm really excited to be back to be here in front of you.,23,,
110,0.97,718.584,728.36,"Last time I was here, we were talking about erasing social justice goals and looking forward to what we're doing this year.",23,,
111,0.97,728.36,746.946,"Now today I'm here to give you kind of a Peek behind the curtain in how we're thinking about Oed's role in function in the regional development system and the local system, and talk a little about how we can revitalize our local committees as we turn the corner on the pandemic.",23,,
112,0.97,746.946,750.483,I want to be clear this really is an update on where we're going.,23,,
113,0.97,750.483,754.52,My intent here is not to say that we've got a fully baked plan.,23,,
114,0.97,754.52,760.459,It's more to reset a conversation with Council about economic and workforce development.,23,,
115,0.97,760.459,764.597,And share with you what we're thinking about some key strategic questions.,23,,
116,0.97,764.597,770.069,"Some of those are who are we serving, how are we serving, and why?",23,,
117,0.97,770.136,774.64,Hat's the right Bal between Oed being Proactive and Reactive to growth opportunities.,23,,
118,0.97,774.64,782.414,"What's the best role for the city and shaping growth, especially in kind of a regional context?",24,,
119,0.97,782.414,787.453,And where can we make the most impact for residences and businesses?,24,,
120,0.97,787.453,794.827,"Those are the questions we're wrestling with, as we're thinking about Oed going into the future.",24,,
121,0.97,794.827,795.294,"Next slide, please.",24,,
122,0.97,795.294,804.37,"Previously, Oed has largely been a collection of programs rather than a strong Department with a clear economic agenda.",24,,
123,0.97,804.37,814.313,"So that's item number one for us as a team over at Oed to figure out what's our coherent mission and vision, and what's our goal?",24,,
124,0.97,814.313,822.822,"Our mission is to build an inclusive economy, where everyone in Seattle can fully participate in and benefit from our prosperity.",24,,
125,0.97,822.822,836.202,"Then our role is to drive economic growth through strategies and investments that open doors and remove barriers to wealth building opportunities, especially for communities that have been Systemically excluded from such opportunities.",24,,
126,0.97,836.202,856.188,"So really, to kind of short hand that, it means that we want to be a DOT Connector, rather than a program manager, or deliver of discreet services, we want to have a larger world view about economic development, and be more of an economic Orchestrater.",24,,
127,0.97,856.188,858.591,So I'll give an example of that.,24,,
128,0.97,858.591,861.66,"Team sports, they don't happen in silos.",24,,
129,0.97,861.66,867.166,One of the missing elements lately has been Seattle being a regional partner.,24,,
130,0.97,867.166,888.387,"So showing up at the regional stage, and really trying to push Seattle's agenda, but seeing how it fits in with other cities with the state, and the government, understanding how we link all of those together, but E.Both to have alignment in our strategies, but to create multiplying effect for our monies.",24,,
131,0.97,888.387,901.1,"Instead of being a program manager, we need to be a regional Player, showing up at Psrc, at the workforce Council and other bodies.",24,,
132,0.97,901.1,901.6,"Next slide, please.",24,,
133,0.97,901.6,912.978,"So one of the key problems that we're focused on at Oed, but also where we see huge opportunity is the issue of how different people benefit.",24,,
134,0.97,912.978,919.652,"How people benefit from the economy very differently, largely based on their race or Ethnicity.",24,,
135,0.97,919.652,924.023,This is one of my favorite quotes by Rafael Bostic.,24,,
136,0.97,924.023,929.128,This happened right after the murder of George Floyd in 2020.,24,,
137,0.97,929.128,939.004,"He wrote an excellent opinion piece about the intersection of race and economic issues, and he said systemic racism is a yolk that drags on the American economy.",24,,
138,0.97,939.004,957.956,This country has both a moral and economic imperative to end these unjust and Disscrimtive Dediscriminative practices.,24,,
139,0.97,957.956,976.775,"The key think we want to focus on is the racial wealth gap, which is quite large, and there's been a lot of focus on the racial income gap, which is important, and we need to focus on job creation, inclusive business practices and talent development.",24,,
140,0.97,976.775,985.05,"Those are all very important, but at Oed, one of the things is this business oath and asset growth management.",24,,
141,0.97,985.05,989.221,Which are really key to where we go in the future.,24,,
142,0.97,989.221,990.222,Next slide please.,24,,
143,0.97,990.222,992.558,What does that mean?,25,,
144,0.97,992.558,998.13,How do we actually tackle the racial wealth gap?,25,,
145,0.97,998.13,1001.1,We're talking about an inclusive economy.,25,,
146,0.97,1001.1,1007.573,We're defining it is the meeting of all these three types of wealth.,25,,
147,0.97,1007.573,1008.54,Often through income generation.,25,,
148,0.97,1008.54,1017.916,"Business wealth, through business growth, and community growth, often through place making strategies that allow for a healthy business environment both at the local neighborhood level.",25,,
149,0.97,1017.916,1023.989,But also the city and the regional level.,25,,
150,0.97,1023.989,1024.69,"Next slide, please.",25,,
151,0.97,1024.69,1032.731,"So for Oed's work to be able to influence those, those are the three areas where we're really going to Prioritize.",25,,
152,0.97,1032.731,1033.665,Workforce development.,25,,
153,0.97,1033.665,1035.1,This is how do we create talent?,25,,
154,0.97,1035.1,1036.902,How do we help match people to jobs.,25,,
155,0.97,1036.902,1046.011,"But at the end of the day, it's really how are we getting people ability career pathways so they can earn higher incomes and better benefits over time.",25,,
156,0.97,1046.011,1052.885,It's not enough to just get people object the first Wrung of the ladder.,25,,
157,0.97,1052.885,1062.661,"We need to think about how are we helping people move from careers as economic conditions change, and job expectations change.",25,,
158,0.97,1062.661,1068.067,Then how are we making sure that they're well prepared to be successful in those careers.,25,,
159,0.97,1068.067,1071.57,Business and industry growth.,25,,
160,0.97,1071.57,1078.51,"I think this is something where we've struggled as a city, both in our industry relations.",25,,
161,0.97,1078.51,1083.115,"So Resetting some of our relationships with Maritime, or technology, Healthcare, construction.",25,,
162,0.97,1083.115,1087.986,We've got some really healthy Industries here in the Puget sound and Seattle region.,25,,
163,0.97,1087.986,1089.822,But we haven't necessarily focused on business growth.,25,,
164,0.97,1089.822,1098.931,"There's been a lot of focus on relief efforts and rightfully so, especially through the pandemic, and helping businesses that are struggling.",25,,
165,0.97,1098.931,1114.546,"But we've also got to Prioritize, how are we helping businesses grow, with a special businesses, gain wealth, and Ow hopefully own their businesses and assets as they go on.",25,,
166,0.97,1114.546,1121.153,This is where we've had some success over the pandemic is really trying to activate our neighborhoods.,25,,
167,0.97,1121.153,1127.559,Making investments that are going to empower neighborhoods to be Self-Determinative about their economic future.,25,,
168,0.97,1127.559,1128.46,I'll give one example.,25,,
169,0.97,1128.46,1132.664,Last Friday I was with three other city Department directors.,25,,
170,0.97,1132.664,1142.741,"We went and visited Lake City collective in district 5, which started out largely as a nonprofit that was supporting their neighborhoods.",25,,
171,0.97,1142.741,1152.784,And is now expanded with the support of Oed to support language access help for businesses all across the city.,25,,
172,0.97,1152.784,1163.061,So when those businesses are trying to access Federal relief funds or trying to tap into an Oed program or get connected with business and training at Seattle public libraries.,25,,
173,0.97,1163.061,1167.199,They can go do Lake City collective and get those resources in language.,25,,
174,0.97,1167.199,1180.679,"So something that started as just a neighborhood business Ecosystem group has now grown into a real citywide asset, we'd like to see Replicated in more neighborhoods.",25,,
175,0.97,1180.679,1181.413,"Next slide, please.",25,,
176,0.97,1181.413,1193.058,"So with these, this kind of new role as an Orchestrater, and with these new demands and challenges, both coming out of the pandemic, but also with the new priorities on wealth creation, we need a new Oed.",25,,
177,0.97,1193.058,1198.564,So a lot of that is happening right now.,25,,
178,0.97,1198.564,1204.736,This is my third in a bit month in a role.,25,,
179,0.97,1204.736,1210.008,"We've been ferociously Regoing at an organization, so we can be more effective at the work.",25,,
180,0.97,1210.008,1219.651,"We can deliver excellent customer service, and we have enough brain power and talent to help with those growth strategies.",25,,
181,0.97,1219.651,1226.758,"One of the biggest things we need to do at Oed is get out of Reactive mode, and get more into Proactive mode.",25,,
182,0.97,1226.758,1229.861,We've been Restruck you Aring the Department.,25,,
183,0.97,1229.861,1231.43,We've been adding capacity and talent.,25,,
184,0.97,1231.43,1233.966,I mentioned this last time.,25,,
185,0.97,1233.966,1239.671,"I will mention it again, we've had 78% turnover of staff in the last 16 months.",25,,
186,0.97,1239.671,1251.416,"It's both an issue in that we've lost a lot of institutional knowledge, but also an opportunity to really add some new capacity and talent to the team.",25,,
187,0.97,1251.416,1256.755,"Throughout it all, we strengthen and grow our regional relationships, but also our partnerships.",25,,
188,0.97,1256.755,1265.731,"As I mentioned at the top, there's tremendous opportunity within our economic development system.",25,,
189,0.97,1265.731,1271.903,"So you see on the right side of the screen, two kind of two sides of the house.",25,,
190,0.97,1271.903,1290.856,"Navigation strategies, so that's when a business comes to us seeking some form of help, whether it's connection to relief dollars, or help with an accounting issue, or any myriad of things they may need help, Oed from the city on.",25,,
191,0.97,1290.856,1297.262,"We need to make sure we're answering their question quickly and succinctly, or with our referral network of partners.",25,,
192,0.97,1297.262,1321.153,"We've got to do a better job of using technology to both monitor and track what we're doing there, so we can be really clear on what trends of questions we're getting, so that we can feed those up to you guys at Council, but also to the Mayor's office and other departments to try to solve problems before they become problems in the future.",25,,
193,0.97,1321.153,1326.958,We're splitting that into three main buckets.,25,,
194,0.97,1326.958,1329.594,We're doing capacity and neighborhood business developments.,25,,
195,0.97,1329.594,1336.068,"Wealth building strategies, which includes real estate, finance, and market expansion, and then our key industries and workforce development group.",25,,
196,0.97,1336.068,1339.671,So more to come on kind of how this is actually shaping out.,25,,
197,0.97,1339.671,1346.445,But I wanted to give you guys a preview of where we are going as a department.,25,,
198,0.97,1346.445,1347.946,"Next slide, please.",25,,
199,0.97,1347.946,1351.516,So some of this is a little repetitive.,25,,
200,0.97,1351.516,1365.263,"But I did want to include one, this lovely picture of people out spending time in their day of service building a better Seattle.",25,,
201,0.97,1365.263,1368.8,So it's the collaborative relationships.,25,,
202,0.97,1368.8,1370.769,It's Aligning regionally.,25,,
203,0.97,1370.769,1371.803,It's Prioritizing Multiplier opportunities.,25,,
204,0.97,1371.803,1374.606,And really Prioritizing innovative work to wealth building.,25,,
205,0.97,1374.606,1380.679,"It's something new Oed for the city to be focusing on, so we're going to have to be smart and creative.",25,,
206,0.97,1380.679,1391.823,"We want to go out and steal ideas from other cities, but also look to communities that are already doing this work, and lift up those ideas that we think could make a difference and scale up quickly.",25,,
207,0.97,1391.823,1392.424,"Next slide, please.",25,,
208,0.97,1392.424,1406.972,"One of the key opportunities that we're focused Enuse we go through our restructuring with this new role is this economic revitalization plan, that Council has Tasked Oed with developing.",25,,
209,0.97,1406.972,1409.841,So this is kind of an outline of how we're doing it.,25,,
210,0.97,1409.841,1413.378,"We will have more to come, hopefully next month, and in the following months.",25,,
211,0.97,1413.378,1422.854,"But first, the goal is to define the future of the Seattle economy, and do this in partnership with a variety of other economic and workforce development players.",25,,
212,0.97,1422.854,1430.195,"We really want to find those shared objectives, and figure out where we agree, rather than focusing on where we disagree.",25,,
213,0.97,1430.195,1438.069,So if we can find those four or five things where there's common agreement where we really need to focus on.,25,,
214,0.97,1438.069,1441.039,Access to capital for small businesses is clearly going to be a priority.,25,,
215,0.97,1441.039,1448.28,"It was a problem before the pandemic, and hugely exacerbated during the pandemic.",25,,
216,0.97,1448.28,1449.114,We did find innovative solutions.,25,,
217,0.97,1449.114,1457.689,"If we can find those four or five things where we agree and really bring people together around them, that's a one Seattle approach to building a more equitable economy.",25,,
218,0.97,1457.689,1465.263,"Second, as part of that study, we've carved out this piece for a city Widework force development plan.",25,,
219,0.97,1465.263,1479.511,"We can have, and we probably will, and entirely other presentation on workforce development, but it's a key moment where our city has had a fragmented approach to workforce development.",25,,
220,0.97,1479.511,1481.88,We've not been a good partner at the regional level.,25,,
221,0.97,1481.88,1487.586,I think we can drive some new ways of getting people connected to jobs and on really successful career pathways.,25,,
222,0.97,1487.586,1499.764,"If you combine the two of those, we'll then have clear recommendations for the payroll expense tax dollars, as well as again, kind of the overall look and feel of the office of economic development.",25,,
223,0.97,1499.764,1514.88,"Throughout it all, with our outreach and engagement, the planning process will create a generation of supporters for these ideas so that again, we're not kind of baking a plan and hoping that, and delivering you kind of a door stop novel of ideas.",25,,
224,0.97,1514.88,1534.366,"We're actually generating this in partnership so at the end, we're already going to be moving Towardimplementation, rather than having a plan fit on the shelf and people figuring out whether it fits their plans and goals.",25,,
225,0.97,1534.366,1543.775,"Phase 1, which is a Meta analysis of local and regional economic and workforce development strategic plans, we'll have at the end of this month.",25,,
226,0.97,1543.775,1553.184,So we'll be sharing that with you guys in July as we kind of go on a little bit of a road show to go back to the partners to tell them what we found.,25,,
227,0.97,1553.184,1553.518,Next slide.,25,,
228,0.97,1553.518,1554.819,So I do want to be clear.,25,,
229,0.97,1554.819,1563.261,"As I talk about the future, I don't want to neglect the present, which is that a lot of businesses and workers still need emergency relief.",25,,
230,0.97,1563.261,1564.296,We're not out of the pandemic.,25,,
231,0.97,1564.296,1569.1,So we really want to set up this next year as a bridge to the future.,25,,
232,0.97,1569.1,1574.773,"So it's a bridge year, where we're both still providing some immediate and emergency relief.",25,,
233,0.97,1574.773,1589.421,But also starting to build out some of those programs that are going to set us up for long term prosperity.,25,,
234,0.97,1589.421,1591.089,"It's imperative, we activate those neighborhoods.",25,,
235,0.97,1591.089,1591.523,Activate downtown.,25,,
236,0.97,1591.523,1596.127,Get people out spending money on main street businesses and really just generating that vibrancy.,25,,
237,0.97,1596.127,1599.097,We need to focus on small business growth.,25,,
238,0.97,1599.097,1606.805,"Again, there's an emergency relief aspect to that, as well as trying to set up businesses for future success and expansion.",25,,
239,0.97,1606.805,1611.209,"I mentioned workforce development, and the citywide investment strategy we've got going on there.",25,,
240,0.97,1611.209,1612.11,Key industry support.,25,,
241,0.97,1612.11,1617.215,There are some industries that are pretty healthy coming out of the pandemic.,25,,
242,0.97,1617.215,1621.419,There are others that really could use some support from the city.,25,,
243,0.97,1621.419,1628.126,"I call it the Maritime industry is one, where there's a lot of changes happening with industrial Maritime lands.",25,,
244,0.97,1628.126,1633.598,We've got to really be a partner and thoughtful about how we're supporting that industry.,25,,
245,0.97,1633.598,1639.004,"It's such a key component of our economic make up, but also our history of our city.",25,,
246,0.97,1639.004,1643.975,We've got to do a better job with our language access and outreach.,25,,
247,0.97,1643.975,1648.947,"It is all well and good, if we develop the coolest program here in the history of the Economics of the city.",25,,
248,0.97,1648.947,1658.556,"If we can't get that out to folks and let them know about it, and encourage everyone to apply and benefit from it, it's worth nothing.",25,,
249,0.97,1658.556,1671.036,"We've got to make sure we're doing it in an equitable way that's inviting people in, and making them feel they can belong and making them feel they can succeed.",25,,
250,0.97,1671.036,1672.003,Next slide.,25,,
251,0.97,1672.003,1685.116,So the good news is that one of the silver Linings of the pandemic is the Clifford dollars were we able to put to use for economic recovery.,25,,
252,0.97,1685.116,1693.825,So we've learned a lot in the past year about where we've deployed those dollars about we can really make a difference.,25,,
253,0.97,1693.825,1713.144,"Seattle restore program, that launched last year, that connects Bipoc businesses, to available spaces in downtown Seattle, is a great example of us providing access, and breaking down barriers.",25,,
254,0.97,1713.144,1716.314,Another example is the ten improvement plan that we piloted in the central area.,25,,
255,0.97,1716.314,1723.955,One of the businesses we helped is the now world famous communion in the liberty Bake building.,25,,
256,0.97,1723.955,1727.492,The ten improvement plan helps with the layout of the space.,25,,
257,0.97,1727.492,1734.933,"We make sure when a business gets in there, that they can be successful, so we want to expand that.",25,,
258,0.97,1734.933,1736.234,"Finally, a small business ownership program.",25,,
259,0.97,1736.234,1738.937,"Again, it's not just about the business growth.",25,,
260,0.97,1738.937,1740.939,It's also about business ownership and asset ownership.,25,,
261,0.97,1740.939,1746.578,"So as we think about these things, this is some stuff that we've learned over the last year.",25,,
262,0.97,1746.578,1751.249,Some with these one time recovery dollars that's really setting us up for success in the future.,25,,
263,0.97,1751.249,1761.159,"And if we can grow and scale those, we believe we're going to be really successful, again, in those goals of trying to grow businesses and get people into higher paying jobs.",25,,
264,0.97,1761.159,1765.13,"Through it all, I'll just mention that last bullet of business technical assistance.",25,,
265,0.97,1765.13,1769.901,We know that businesses need help with the paper game.,25,,
266,0.97,1769.901,1776.674,"It's not always easy figuring out how to apply for a loan, or how to apply for some of these grant programs.",25,,
267,0.97,1776.674,1785.016,So we've got to make sure we're holding their hands with CBO's and other organizations to help hold their hands as well.,25,,
268,0.97,1785.016,1788.186,"It really is, as I mentioned earlier, a team game.",25,,
269,0.97,1788.186,1797.462,"A team sport, economic development, and we've got to build a better, more sophisticated team to help build those businesses and workers.",25,,
270,0.97,1797.462,1797.796,Next slide.,25,,
271,0.97,1797.796,1804.035,"So wrapping up, we've got new demands, new strategies, and a new look Oed.",25,,
272,0.97,1804.035,1809.474,The city has got to Prioritize wealth building and income Beasting efforts.,25,,
273,0.97,1809.474,1815.28,So our economic boosting developments are on the business practices for income boosting efforts.,25,,
274,0.97,1815.28,1821.352,"And then business ownership, business growth, and asset ownership for the wealth building efforts.",25,,
275,0.97,1821.352,1831.229,"Listed here are just, again, some of the new pieces that we're really going to focus on in the near term as we're doing our reorganization and adding talent capacity.",25,,
276,0.97,1831.229,1833.965,We want to focus on real estate.,25,,
277,0.97,1833.965,1840.505,"We want to focus on financial, particularly access to capital, and we want to focus on market expansion.",25,,
278,0.97,1840.505,1844.209,We think these three areas are going to be kind of hallmarks for Oed going forward.,25,,
279,0.97,1844.209,1850.648,"They're going to take us a little time to build out, but we're really excited about what they can bring to the mix.",25,,
280,0.97,1850.648,1855.286,We're going to continue to do the technical assistance.,25,,
281,0.97,1855.286,1871.002,"Some of these new pieces we think are going to be the real key between where we were Pre- pandemic, and where we want to go to a more equitable economy Post-Ppandemic.",25,,
282,0.97,1871.002,1874.505,"With that, I will stand for any questions.",25,,
283,0.97,1874.505,1876.407,"Thank you, mark.",26,,
284,0.97,1876.407,1880.078,You had me at the new Oed.,26,,
285,0.97,1880.078,1890.455,"So it's clear from your presentation, how vitally important Oed's work and mission are, and it's Solidifying identity.",26,,
286,0.97,1890.455,1904.269,It has been hobbled by staffing shortages for years in the 78% staff turnover was really striking.,26,,
287,0.97,1904.269,1927.492,"I also think, you know, it has been, I don't know, the importance of its work has been down played or we have failed to recognize, I'll just say its importance as the place where equity in terms of job creation and Bipoc wealth generation and Antiwealth displacement lives in city government.",26,,
288,0.97,1927.492,1936.701,So this will be top of mind as we go into the budget discussions.,26,,
289,0.97,1936.701,1938.136,And that's all I have.,26,,
290,0.97,1938.136,1946.978,I'll open it first for questions from my colleagues.,26,,
291,0.97,1946.978,1954.552,Well I'll get things started here.,26,,
292,0.97,1954.552,1963.528,"I really like you distinguishing between navigation services, which I think as direct to businesses and growth strategies.",26,,
293,0.97,1963.528,1963.795,Programs.,26,,
294,0.97,1963.795,1968.533,"So when it comes to it's navigation services, you spoke to it a little bit.",26,,
295,0.97,1968.533,1979.477,"I'm wondering if you could expand on that and because you and I have spoke of a help desk and the back team, so I just wanted to hear a little bit more about that.",26,,
296,0.97,1979.477,1983.915,Sure.,27,,
297,0.97,1983.915,1989.821,"Right now our front door to Oed is a little, it's either hard to reach, or hard to get in.",27,,
298,0.97,1989.821,1995.593,"So we need to have a better front door, both technologically, but also our system for intake.",27,,
299,0.97,1995.593,2001.499,"So when a business calls, making sure that they get connected as quickly as possible to the resource that they need.",27,,
300,0.97,2001.499,2008.84,"Right now, it's a little bit ad hoc, if you reach the right person on the team, lucky for you.",27,,
301,0.97,2008.84,2011.309,"If you don't, it gets a little hairy.",27,,
302,0.97,2011.309,2015.713,So we've got a system that ties how we're doing those issues and calls.,27,,
303,0.97,2015.713,2018.516,"Some of that, as you mentioned is the technology.",27,,
304,0.97,2018.516,2019.851,So what is our Website.,27,,
305,0.97,2019.851,2024.989,What kind of help desk Online can we offer to quickly answer questions that people might have.,27,,
306,0.97,2024.989,2026.691,Some of that is our own staff.,27,,
307,0.97,2026.691,2035.967,"So how we're assigning those tickets out, and making sure that they're getting followed up on, and finding trends so they can help influence policymaking developments.",27,,
308,0.97,2035.967,2045.576,"Some of that is working with other departments, ideally through the Resuscitated city business action team, so that we can batch some of those problems together.",27,,
309,0.97,2045.576,2055.92,"Have a team of decision makers in different departments so we can take those problems, get them quickly resolved, and then get the businesses moving onto whatever's next in their business cycle.",27,,
310,0.97,2055.92,2059.49,So there's a variety of elements that we're trying to tie together.,27,,
311,0.97,2059.49,2065.43,"It is building up kind of a new system, so it's a Littlerockyer than I had anticipated.",27,,
312,0.97,2065.43,2076.074,"But I think there's a lot of energy on the team for finding a solution, working with businesses to figure out how to some their problems in a quick and efficient manner.",27,,
313,0.97,2076.074,2076.374,Great.,28,,
314,0.97,2076.374,2086.717,"As a small business owner, I've often thought there should be a one stop shop where you can get all of your information about licenses and permits, and Yada, Yada.",28,,
315,0.97,2086.717,2096.427,"If Spci is telling one person to do one thing, but city light is saying, no, you have to do this other thing first, that kind of coordinated response that departments can talk to each other.",28,,
316,0.97,2096.427,2101.432,"But I really appreciate the emphasis on that, and I'm sure other small businesses do too.",28,,
317,0.97,2101.432,2121.119,"Well and part of it is at Oed we've got to play a little bit of a translator role between businesses and government, because they do move at different speeds, and they do talk about things differently, so we've got to figure out how we do a better job of translating so that we're on the same page, and working on the same Timeframes.",29,,
318,0.97,2121.119,2130.328,"Because oftentimes, I think that's where we get off Kilter is a business needs something in a week, and the city is maybe, that's not how the process is set up to answer that type of question.",29,,
319,0.97,2130.328,2140.338,So we've got to do a better job of Syncing those things up.,29,,
320,0.97,2140.338,2141.405,Councilmember Sawant.,30,,
321,0.97,2141.405,2147.011,Thank you for the presentation.,31,,
322,0.97,2147.011,2161.392,I'm just wondering what are the conversations having about the recession that is moving in front of us?,31,,
323,0.97,2161.392,2168.9,"And in reality, so many economists are actually wondering if the recession is already underway?",31,,
324,0.97,2168.9,2180.711,"If you look at the runaway inflation, the historic 40 year high inflation, people are really feeling the pinch at the gas pump and in the grocery store.",31,,
325,0.97,2180.711,2206.07,"Just given the way the economy under capitalism is set up, we know that 3/4 of what holds up the economy in terms of GDP is consumer spending, and given this dire situation, I hope you all have been discussing what impact this will have on the economy as a whole, but especially for only people, working people, struggling small businesses.",31,,
326,0.97,2206.07,2211.342,The prognosis does seem to be extremely concerning.,31,,
327,0.97,2211.342,2229.56,"And I'm asking this question in general, but also in the context of the fact that an interesting ruling came from the Washington state court of Appeals yesterday that this ruling upheld the Amazon Fax that is run by ordinary people's movements in 2020.",31,,
328,0.97,2229.56,2233.164,I mention that for several reasons.,31,,
329,0.97,2233.164,2244.108,"One is obviously that without that Fax actually in the Covid recession, the Seattle economy would have cratered if it wasn't for the revelation by that tax.",31,,
330,0.97,2244.108,2262.26,"But that tax was something that metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and big businesses, and the wealthy really were extremely hostile to, Mr. mark McIntyre, you were, I believe the executive vice president of the Seattle metropolitan Camber of Commerce at that time.",31,,
331,0.97,2262.26,2276.674,"So anyway may point is that the positions that the big businesses have taken historically have been extremely contrary to what is claimed, which is the health of the economy and so on.",31,,
332,0.97,2276.674,2282.913,It was proven beyond a shadow of the doubt how critical the Amazon tax has been for the economy.,31,,
333,0.97,2282.913,2286.484,"In fact, we need much more.",31,,
334,0.97,2286.484,2292.757,"We need to increase Theamazon tax, but I'm also asking that, as I said in the dire predictions for the economy.",31,,
335,0.97,2292.757,2295.926,"If you can just weigh in on that, thank you.",31,,
336,0.97,2295.926,2300.931,"Sure, thanks for bringing up the possible looming recession.",32,,
337,0.97,2300.931,2301.532,It is concerning.,32,,
338,0.97,2301.532,2307.638,"And in conversations, I think there's a couple things that we can do to prepare ourselves.",32,,
339,0.97,2307.638,2316.147,One is we need to get smarter at Oed about what's going on with Microand Macroeconomics.,32,,
340,0.97,2316.147,2334.198,"That's going to help us get ahead of these and better understand what's going on locally, so we can Taylor our strategies and investments to hopefully prevent the worst, but also set us up for success coming out of issues like the pandemic.",32,,
341,0.97,2334.198,2343.641,"Second, I think this was a huge silver line was the regional alliance and partnership.",32,,
342,0.97,2343.641,2344.809,We're going to be stronger.,32,,
343,0.97,2344.809,2355.92,"We have alliance and support each other, that's going to be key to weathering any storm, whether it's the pandemic, a looming recession, or anything else is working together as a region.",32,,
344,0.97,2355.92,2356.62,So it is concerning.,32,,
345,0.97,2356.62,2360.291,"We are talking about it, and trying to prepare as best we can.",32,,
346,0.97,2360.291,2375.172,"But I guess the flip side of that is any any downturn there's always opportunity, and we need to be geared up for setting ourselves up for future success for the residents and businesses.",32,,
347,0.97,2375.172,2377.241,What opportunity would you be talking about?,33,,
348,0.97,2377.241,2385.783,Right now the living standards for the majority of people are under extreme stress.,34,,
349,0.97,2385.783,2391.922,"And small businesses were among those who took the brunt of the pandemic, and recession.",34,,
350,0.97,2391.922,2394.825,So I'm really not understanding what you mean by opportunity.,34,,
351,0.97,2394.825,2402.666,"Also, what is the vision here and the basis of a lot of what --",34,,
352,0.97,2402.666,2404.902,Councilmember Herbold does have a question.,35,,
353,0.97,2404.902,2413.677,But I'm a member of this Committee and I'm asking a question.,36,,
354,0.97,2413.677,2420.418,I'm not understanding what is the vision the forces that you've been in conversations with are bringing?,36,,
355,0.97,2420.418,2427.958,"I mean as I mentioned, the metropolitan Chamber of Commerce sued the city to overturn the Amazon tax.",36,,
356,0.97,2427.958,2433.697,The Court of Appeals has just upheld the tax.,36,,
357,0.97,2433.697,2443.34,But what is the vision you're bringing if you're opposed to even common sense measures that the city actually needs?,36,,
358,0.97,2443.34,2451.081,So when you see opportunities like an Oxymoron to me . Nds opportunities for whom?,36,,
359,0.97,2451.081,2455.553,The vast majority of ordinary people and small businesses are going to take the brunt of this recession.,36,,
360,0.97,2455.553,2457.288,What is the opportunity for them?,36,,
361,0.97,2457.288,2462.46,What is the opportunity to see when the gas pumps at $6 for a gallon?,36,,
362,0.97,2462.46,2464.195,I'm not saying that it will be easy.,37,,
363,0.97,2464.195,2468.999,"But I think first of all, we've got to stabilize and provide relief to those who are suffering.",37,,
364,0.97,2468.999,2476.774,And I think we've seen how we've done that through the pandemic.,37,,
365,0.97,2476.774,2479.577,It hasn't been successful across the board.,37,,
366,0.97,2479.577,2485.316,We see a historic rise in the small number of businesses that were created.,37,,
367,0.97,2485.316,2487.852,People left their jobs and started creating businesses.,37,,
368,0.97,2487.852,2490.521,We've got to find a way to support them.,37,,
369,0.97,2490.521,2493.157,It's not easy running a small business.,37,,
370,0.97,2493.157,2493.624,It's incredibly hard.,37,,
371,0.97,2493.624,2496.894,"We at the city, unfortunately, sometimes make it harder.",37,,
372,0.97,2496.894,2514.178,"Again, that's why I really want Oed's role to be about breaking down barriers, and opening doors, so that those who have been excluded from economic prosperity in times past, regardless of current conditions that we're doing our best.",37,,
373,0.97,2514.178,2531.262,"I'm not trying to sugar coat it, or say that it's going to be easy, or that there won't be suffering along the way, but we've got to do our best to try to alleviate that, and set them up for success.",37,,
374,0.97,2531.262,2534.131,Councilmember Herbold.,38,,
375,0.97,2534.131,2548.846,"Thank you, I just wanted to ask a couple questions that I've had the opportunity to in our meeting together.",39,,
376,0.97,2548.846,2562.693,"Going into your answers, I want to talk a little bit about the key industries for the city on slide 10 you mentioned that key industry to support is a bridge to the future.",39,,
377,0.97,2562.693,2576.607,"And as I've mentioned to you in our meetings, I'd really like to see creative Industries Rstored to the short list of key industries that drive our city's future.",39,,
378,0.97,2576.607,2585.482,The city's 2019 creative economy study found that the creative sector drives a full 18% of our GDP here in Seattle.,39,,
379,0.97,2585.482,2601.298,"That's four times the national average, and we know that a sub set of workers in the sector are arts, culture, film, and music workers have been among the hardest hit and the slowest to recover from the pandemic.",39,,
380,0.97,2601.298,2614.645,"So focusing efforts on this sector has the potential not only to help us rebound faster here in Seattle, but to preserve what we all agree is so special about our city.",39,,
381,0.97,2614.645,2636.367,So just wanting to know a little bit about how you're thinking about the creative economy as you consider leaving the Department's work and the strategies that we can look forward to working together to lift up this really important contributor to our city's economy.,39,,
382,0.97,2636.367,2639.236,I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.,39,,
383,0.97,2639.236,2644.208,"I also have one additional follow-up question, if that's okay.",39,,
384,0.97,2644.208,2647.011,"Maybe not really a follow-up question, a separate question.",39,,
385,0.97,2647.011,2648.646,"Before we begin, can I mention something?",40,,
386,0.97,2648.646,2663.594,"I was going to say the end of my questions, that I didn't ask anything about film, or the creative economy cluster, because we're going to be having another discussion just about that on July 27th.",40,,
387,0.97,2663.594,2663.961,Proceed.,40,,
388,0.97,2663.961,2670.3,This is not just film and music.,41,,
389,0.97,2670.3,2673.07,This is the creative Industries more broad.,41,,
390,0.97,2673.07,2673.37,Thank you.,41,,
391,0.97,2673.37,2673.937,Thanks for the question.,42,,
392,0.97,2673.937,2686.35,"You're right, a lot of those industries were the first to shut down and the last to open, coming out of the pandemic, so they're very much feeling the brunt of the economic leg.",42,,
393,0.97,2686.35,2697.628,"So if our goals at Oed are how do we boost people's income and get them into jobs with higher pay and better benefits and Secondly, how do we grow businesses to grow well?",42,,
394,0.97,2697.628,2704.134,I think the creative Industries fit nicely into that rubric.,42,,
395,0.97,2704.134,2712.676,"If we're talking about creative economy jobs, those exist in a variety of different Industries beyond just kind of film, music, Nightlife, special events.",42,,
396,0.97,2712.676,2727.958,"So we've got to figure out, and as you said in the study, it's shown that that's where there's going to be a lot of job growth now and into the future, particularly because those tend to be automation proof jobs.",42,,
397,0.97,2727.958,2738.202,"As well as we have an incredibly innovative spirit here in Seattle, and part of that is harvesting that, and figuring out to put that in a creative way.",42,,
398,0.97,2738.202,2748.779,"Second is how are we supporting those specific industries, to make sure those businesses are as successful as possible.",42,,
399,0.97,2748.779,2753.45,I will call out films as an example.,42,,
400,0.97,2753.45,2766.697,"Working with Stakeholders, working with production businesses to figure out what do they need both in the short term and in the long term and trying to come up with a plan of how to best serve them.",42,,
401,0.97,2766.697,2776.74,Coming to this Committee at the end of July to talk about as an example of how we're supporting one of the creative industries.,42,,
402,0.97,2776.74,2777.374,So it is important.,42,,
403,0.97,2777.374,2798.896,"That's part of the capacity that we're building on the team, so we have more brain power and do the outreach, and understand what the needs are, to again, get locals into those high paying creative jobs, as well as support those in creative industries to be successful coming out of the pandemic.",42,,
404,0.97,2798.896,2799.263,Thank you.,43,,
405,0.97,2799.263,2802.533,May I ask my separate question?,43,,
406,0.97,2802.533,2805.068,Thanks so much.,43,,
407,0.97,2805.068,2837.501,"Just following up on our discussion around how Oed can work with the office of housing and facilitate their interest in taking a sort of development to housing development, sort of housing and different types of spaces that can activate a community whether or not it's a retail space.",43,,
408,0.97,2837.501,2841.471,"Some other kind of commercial nonprofit use, a cultural space.",43,,
409,0.97,2841.471,2853.35,"In my group, my district I've been working for several years working toward that, getting a surplus piece of property.",43,,
410,0.97,2853.35,2874.538,"They've long held a division of developing affordable housing, and with ground floor commercial space to help activate that sweet space, provide safety, provide opportunity for small entrepreneurs and contribute to a more Walkable community in a place that isn't terribly Walkable right now.",43,,
411,0.97,2874.538,2879.409,"Office of housing has funds that can award, potentially support affordable housing on that site.",43,,
412,0.97,2879.409,2898.462,"And the trick is, as I know you understand, Dr. McIntyre, is how to brave those funds with other kinds of support that will allow for that ground floor retail to be built and affordable as well.",43,,
413,0.97,2898.462,2912.376,"I know that you've been having conversations wanting to hear since I know you had had a meeting with her to talk about this topic, to see if there's anything new to bear?",43,,
414,0.97,2912.376,2913.577,Thanks for bringing it up.,44,,
415,0.97,2913.577,2924.688,"I think this is so exciting, because we know we need more housing, and we know we need affordable commercial space, so putting those together in the same project just makes a ton of sense.",44,,
416,0.97,2924.688,2936.166,"There's also a workforce angle there as well, as we're building these housing units and managing them how we're getting them hired into those good paying construction jobs.",44,,
417,0.97,2936.166,2946.91,"So in my talks with some of the other directors that include Opcd as another Department that we're working with, to explore this.",44,,
418,0.97,2946.91,2947.978,There's a lot of interest.,44,,
419,0.97,2947.978,2953.45,It does get a little technical into how you Braid those funds together.,44,,
420,0.97,2953.45,2954.284,I like that phrase.,44,,
421,0.97,2954.284,2955.619,I might steal it from you.,44,,
422,0.97,2955.619,2967.497,"Some of the programs I mentioned, like the ten improvement Fund are really set up to help and as well as Seattle restore, help make sure that we're doing that match making.",44,,
423,0.97,2967.497,2979.042,"That we're making spaces work for different types of businesses, and Ideally, we're putting people on the path to ownership of their real estate.",44,,
424,0.97,2979.042,2984.548,So symptom of the stuff we're launching now can contribute to the office of planning and community development.,44,,
425,0.97,2984.548,2987.617,There's a couple opportunities that we see going into the future.,44,,
426,0.97,2987.617,3006.269,"One is the 2023 housing levee, because that's going to be a renewal of a lot of resources, so making sure we're calling out affordable retail space is important.",44,,
427,0.97,3006.269,3016.713,"As we Unzipped a code, thinking about are there any changes we can do?",44,,
428,0.97,3016.713,3019.983,So more to come on that.,44,,
429,0.97,3019.983,3029.86,We're actually working on a slide for Council in this regard that will be delivered later this year to kind of give you a more grounded sense of where we're going with this.,44,,
430,0.97,3029.86,3033.263,But know this is one of the areas of opportunity we see.,44,,
431,0.97,3033.263,3043.373,"But certainly, with a new Oed that wants to be a real strong partner, one of those is going to be with the Department of housing and Opcd.",44,,
432,0.97,3043.373,3048.045,So looking forward to it.,44,,
433,0.97,3048.045,3050.28,Councilmember Juarez has a question.,44,,
434,0.97,3050.28,3066.229,"I just wanted to note that regarding the creative cluster, there is a position that we're going to be waiting from you for more information about how to lift that.",44,,
435,0.97,3066.229,3073.904,"As soon as we get that position filled, we can add horsepower to those efforts.",44,,
436,0.97,3073.904,3077.574,"Okay, Council President war easy.",44,,
437,0.97,3077.574,3078.341,"Thank you, Madam chair.",45,,
438,0.97,3078.341,3091.922,"First of all, Marcum, thank you for being here and your presentation, and moving from the nonprofit private sector if you will, to now becoming a public servant.",45,,
439,0.97,3091.922,3108.138,"I actually like to have it on the aisle more, because now I feel like we're part of the solution, and we can have discussions about the jump start Amazon tax, and what that means, and how we use those funds.",45,,
440,0.97,3108.138,3115.846,"But getting back to your presentation, the calm that I was most interested in is the financial and access to capital.",45,,
441,0.97,3115.846,3119.416,I obviously support small businesses in assisting them.,45,,
442,0.97,3119.416,3138.802,"My focus has been in my personal professional life is building the economies, establishing economic engines, teaching people how to go to a bank, write a business plan, get a loan, and access to capital.",45,,
443,0.97,3138.802,3144.207,"I'm wondering why, is Oed going to take an active role in working with the small business Association?",45,,
444,0.97,3144.207,3171.034,"Because we do a lot of work with them and I know that there's some whispering now about some taxing coming up on a particular industry, and a lot of those issues, if we talk about what training is, it really is about, and I used to do this for clients and tribes, and individuals, working your way with the small business Association in taking the class, and teaching how to write a business plan.",45,,
445,0.97,3171.034,3176.506,"What is your business, mock interviews, low interest loan capital.",45,,
446,0.97,3176.506,3190.287,"And then, the small business, the SpA, at least under the native American and other groups as well, would end up forgiving the loan when you became not so much successful, but when you could make the payments.",45,,
447,0.97,3190.287,3197.294,So I don't think you need to reinvent the wheel.,45,,
448,0.97,3197.294,3206.703,"Are you working with, because you're talking about less Thankers, you're going to need investors, you're going to need to now how to go to a bank.",45,,
449,0.97,3206.703,3211.942,"I don't think it's so much hand holding, because I think people have the know and the drive how to do it.",45,,
450,0.97,3211.942,3219.115,"But it's more what are some of the existing programs that are here that have already been successful, that is Oed going to take advantage of, and use?",45,,
451,0.97,3219.115,3224.988,This goes back to my love of alignments that I completely agree.,46,,
452,0.97,3224.988,3226.222,We don't lack for resources here.,46,,
453,0.97,3226.222,3237.968,A lot of it is more about how we're navigating people to the right resources and kind of opening those doors for them.,46,,
454,0.97,3237.968,3249.112,"So yes, I feel really lucky, that Mike Fong is now the director.",46,,
455,0.97,3249.112,3253.883,He has the city as well as a love for Seattle.,46,,
456,0.97,3253.883,3262.926,"As I started out here, I think he was one of the first people to call me when the deployment was announced.",46,,
457,0.97,3262.926,3269.332,"We've got some stuff that we're cooking up, that we'll be excited to announce soon.",46,,
458,0.97,3269.332,3286.916,"An early example was when SpA announced their Businessperson for the year for the Pacific Northwest, we were there, just as a a kind of showing example, but we've got some more meaty stuff coming in the future.",46,,
459,0.97,3286.916,3300.363,"So just one of the issues, and I don't think it's a secret about the potential taxing of the Cannabis industry, and access to capital, and Councilmember Herbold knows this as well as I do.",47,,
460,0.97,3300.363,3302.632,I'm sure Councilmember Nelson knows as well.,47,,
461,0.97,3302.632,3316.513,"We can't do a lot until we have the Federal banking laws change until we have people who want to open, and that's why we see the Inhe inequities.",47,,
462,0.97,3316.513,3316.946,It's right there.,47,,
463,0.97,3316.946,3320.317,"I don't know if taxing is the right response, quite frankly.",47,,
464,0.97,3320.317,3323.553,I don't know what kind of training that means.,47,,
465,0.97,3323.553,3344.941,"If we had it where people could go to a bank, to get capital, to get a loan, to start a small business for a Cannabis store, I could see where there would be training, and you would connect with a small Business- like model, and teach people, there's class you have to take, here's how you get your loan.",47,,
466,0.97,3344.941,3347.31,I don't know if we're there yet.,47,,
467,0.97,3347.31,3360.957,"But what do you see for Oed doing that for other Businesse that can go to a bank or a venture capital group, or how are you going to open up those systems and do more?",47,,
468,0.97,3360.957,3367.464,"Really, what is Oed going to do to open up that, so people can have access to a bank, to do a loan, to start a business?",47,,
469,0.97,3367.464,3369.733,Because that's really what a lot of folks need.,47,,
470,0.97,3369.733,3378.408,"They need that kind of education, and they need that kind much access, and opportunity, if indeed, we're going to close this gap, this wealth.",47,,
471,0.97,3378.408,3381.511,I couldn't agree with you more.,48,,
472,0.97,3381.511,3383.58,"We see businesses needing three things, right?",48,,
473,0.97,3383.58,3386.983,They need the training to run a successful business.,48,,
474,0.97,3386.983,3389.953,But there's a lot of programs that just kind of stop there.,48,,
475,0.97,3389.953,3392.522,All they're giving is some sort of education.,48,,
476,0.97,3392.522,3397.927,"But really, what they then need is access to capital, and access to markets.",48,,
477,0.97,3397.927,3402.932,"So if you compare those three things together, that's usually a successful recipe.",48,,
478,0.97,3402.932,3414.911,"That's the work on the access to capital markets, is why are we reshaping Oeds to have a focus on those, that's where we see business growth really needing that kind of attention.",48,,
479,0.97,3414.911,3418.348,I'll give you an example of the program we launched with the Federal dollars.,48,,
480,0.97,3418.348,3433.53,"So the state has a flex fund where they're offering loans at a fairly low interest rate through our community development, and financial institution Cdfi's, to small businesses in need.",48,,
481,0.97,3433.53,3441.004,"The city, using those Cliffer dollars developed a capital access program, where we can actually pay down 25% of their principle.",48,,
482,0.97,3441.004,3445.909,So it essentially made the access more affordable for those small businesses that really needed it.,48,,
483,0.97,3445.909,3460.757,"We're going to have to do creative things like that, because the city is not looking to become a lender, and get in the lending game, but there are ways we can make it more affordable, or open doors or break down barriers to that capital.",48,,
484,0.97,3460.757,3468.264,"This is why we need to get out of Reactive mode, and into Proactive mode.",48,,
485,0.97,3468.264,3473.803,"If we only respond to crises, we will never come up with those creative solutions.",48,,
486,0.97,3473.803,3476.973,That's why we've got to do our reorganization.,48,,
487,0.97,3476.973,3480.41,You've essentially sold why we're doing what we're doing in a nut Shell.,48,,
488,0.97,3480.41,3485.315,"So my last comment, if I may, Madam chair --",49,,
489,0.97,3485.315,3485.648,Yes.,50,,
490,0.97,3485.648,3502.298,"Is that we're still in the process of it, we'll be doing it soon, rolling out more than a land acknowledgement, and we've been working with tribes, and as you know, the Muckleshoot nation is a big property owner.",51,,
491,0.97,3502.298,3510.273,"They just bought a $27 million housing in district 4. I'm trying to get them to all come North, by the way.",51,,
492,0.97,3510.273,3515.912,"I'm trying to work with the Simon, Oeg and folks here.",51,,
493,0.97,3515.912,3519.482,"We developed well over 5,000 jobs, and we're very proud of the work that we've done here.",51,,
494,0.97,3519.482,3546.442,"I want to make sure that Oed is working with Tim Rainion, who the Mayor hired as a tribal liaison, because Tim is a phenomenal hire for the executive, being a lawyer, and a former tribal Councilmember on the Puyallup tribe and understands economic development like the back of his hand, like me.",51,,
495,0.97,3546.442,3549.712,How indigenous and tribes invest in their city.,51,,
496,0.97,3549.712,3553.182,"This is their city, the city of Seattle.",51,,
497,0.97,3553.182,3554.083,Hence more the land acknowledgement.,51,,
498,0.97,3554.083,3557.921,"We are working with Tim, but to work with you as well.",51,,
499,0.97,3557.921,3570.967,"And how we structure and kind of redo what we did in Indian country, and the city of Seattle, not only for individuals, but also to bring in tribes to invest everywhere.",51,,
500,0.97,3570.967,3574.704,"I think people need to understand, tribes do more than casinos and hotels.",51,,
501,0.97,3574.704,3578.975,"We actually own a lot of stuff, and a lot of property.",51,,
502,0.97,3578.975,3588.251,"The tribe just linked a deal with Kenmore air, and Amazon.",51,,
503,0.97,3588.251,3609.105,"That's the attraction, in my discussions with tribal leaders is they want some kind of Inroad Besides the executive like office of economic Develop.Ment, that there's a place for them, and I don't think there's anyone at Oed doing that kind of work, and I don't think we can put it on the shoulders of Mr. Ranion.",51,,
504,0.97,3609.105,3624.354,"I hope we have a chance to have coffee Offline, and talk about the economic development, and vitality that tribes have to offer, including Leveraging their sovereignty in their own land, but also, obviously to land in Oed.",51,,
505,0.97,3624.354,3627.724,I'm really looking forward to that.,51,,
506,0.97,3627.724,3629.826,I'm looking forward to it as well.,52,,
507,0.97,3629.826,3631.027,I'm excited about the opportunity for presenting.,52,,
508,0.97,3631.027,3634.364,That's exactly the type of stuff that we want to get working on.,52,,
509,0.97,3634.364,3641.371,I look forward to talking to Tim about that more.,52,,
510,0.97,3641.371,3646.476,I'm going to say something that's probably obvious to everybody.,53,,
511,0.97,3646.476,3649.012,Business is about relationships.,53,,
512,0.97,3649.012,3650.413,It's about welcoming communities and neighborhoods.,53,,
513,0.97,3650.413,3654.517,I think the bottom line is you need economic engines so people have jobs.,53,,
514,0.97,3654.517,3664.56,"If they have jobs, then you have transportation, and libraries, and good schools, and sidewalks, and you get the good stuff.",53,,
515,0.97,3664.56,3691.02,"We've been working really hard, and I want to point out Councilmember that counsel Sawant Councilmember Sawant as well.",53,,
516,0.97,3691.02,3693.389,I really appreciate those comments.,54,,
517,0.97,3693.389,3698.461,"Small businesses employee about 70% of the people that work in the private sector, so that's jobs.",54,,
518,0.97,3698.461,3699.862,"Anyway, we're running out of time.",54,,
519,0.97,3699.862,3704.267,I would have liked to have asked about downtown revitalization.,54,,
520,0.97,3704.267,3707.737,We can talk about that off line.,54,,
521,0.97,3707.737,3713.743,"To me it means improving third Avenue, perhaps, and business recruitment.",54,,
522,0.97,3713.743,3715.044,But that's for another discussion.,54,,
523,0.97,3715.044,3716.879,"So thank you, thank you, thank you very much.",54,,
524,0.97,3716.879,3730.793,"We will see you on the 27th to talk about the film economy, and I invite any of my colleagues to set up appointments with director mark McIntyre.",54,,

537,0.97,3815.011,3818.815,"They were effective on April 1st, 2021.",58,,
538,0.97,3818.815,3832.528,"So differing from their regular practice, city light proposed the and the Council adopted a five year strategic plan through 2026.",58,,
539,0.97,3832.528,3834.931,After Council approved that rate plan.,58,,

569,0.97,3979.208,3992.054,"The process was established by Council ordinance, and it has a six year rate path in addition to a set of priorities initiatives with the rate path to support that work.",70,,
570,0.97,3992.054,3996.826,We developed the strategic plan in partnership with our city light review panel.,70,,
571,0.97,3996.826,4001.364,"They provide input on the plan, and the right design.",70,,
572,0.97,4001.364,4011.374,Nine members of the panel are representatives of our various customer groups and areas of expertise.,70,,

587,0.97,4108.27,4117.746,"Two highlights, I guess that came out of that is that a vast majority of respondents were concerned about climate change.",70,,
588,0.97,4117.746,4133.395,"All demographics listed, reducing climate change impacts, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and reducing an environmental impacts as the three most important benefits of achieving 100% clean energy by 2045.",70,,

594,0.97,4193.689,4201.23,"Each of the programs, initiatives, and the strategic plan need to be supported by the accompanying budget.",70,,
595,0.97,4201.23,4212.875,"Each much those programs needs to analyze the rates of social justice impacts that it may have on our customers, the constituents, the residents of the city of Seattle, any of our Stakeholders.",70,,
596,0.97,4212.875,4218.147,"So this year, we held a number of what we called equity LABS.",70,,

620,0.97,4452.514,4464.66,"And as we just heard from the previous presenter, and as a community owned utility, our job is to help our customers thrive in the future we're creating together.",70,,
621,0.97,4464.66,4471.934,So now we'll talk about each of the business strategies very quickly.,70,,
622,0.97,4471.934,4473.168,Did you know manager Smith?,71,,
623,0.97,4473.168,4475.971,Did you have a question?,71,,
624,0.97,4475.971,4479.041,I think I saw your hand.,71,,
625,0.97,4479.041,4479.441,"Okay, sorry.",71,,
626,0.97,4479.441,4491.086,"Okay, our first business strategy, improve the customer experience.",72,,
627,0.97,4491.086,4491.553,One moment.,73,,
628,0.97,4491.553,4492.654,She is now talking.,73,,
629,0.97,4492.654,4502.197,"I was just saying, it looks like Councilmember Juarez has her hand up.",74,,
630,0.97,4502.197,4504.066,"No, that's an old hand.",75,,
631,0.97,4504.066,4504.533,Okay.,76,,
632,0.97,4504.533,4505.667,"Thank you, thank you.",77,,
633,0.97,4505.667,4533.996,"With the customer experience we're focused on engaging with our customers and helping our employees see the impact of our actions from the customer's perspective, and we are also making investments to enhance accessibility and offer new program choices to better meet our customers' diverse needs.",77,,
634,0.97,4533.996,4538.166,Okay thank you.,77,,
635,0.97,4538.166,4538.934,So this is Creator energy future.,77,,
636,0.97,4538.934,4547.91,Our energy future is based on carbon free renewable resources.,77,,
637,0.97,4547.91,4558.253,"A new, or improved infrastructure is needed to ensure that electricity can be accessed whenever and wherever people need it.",77,,
638,0.97,4558.253,4584.579,"So much of the strategy to to enhance and upgrade our system to allow us to support the increased Electrification from buildings, and transportation while also looking at Federal funding availability to help us fund some of these efforts.",77,,
639,0.97,4584.579,4588.317,"Next, please, thank you.",77,,
640,0.97,4588.317,4590.652,Develop workforce and organizational agility.,77,,
641,0.97,4590.652,4594.323,This strategy is our industry is transforming quickly.,77,,
642,0.97,4594.323,4597.392,"And so are our customers' needs, and expectations.",77,,
643,0.97,4597.392,4610.872,"So we have to invest in our people, processes, and technologies to enable them to thrive in this Transformational environment.",77,,
644,0.97,4610.872,4625.287,"We're cultivating a workforce with the skills and knowledge to align with evolving business processes and business needs, and to advance social justice.",77,,
645,0.97,4625.287,4630.292,Next.,77,,
646,0.97,4630.292,4635.831,Financial stability is essential to everything we do.,77,,
647,0.97,4635.831,4656.184,"Responsible financial planning makes it possible for us to deliver the Innovated energy solutions, plan for critical investments, and to keep our rates affordable.",77,,
648,0.97,4656.184,4658.553,"What you'll see here, there are three.",77,,
649,0.97,4658.553,4675.27,"Each of these slides highlights three important areas and programs that we're developing for each, and you'll hear more about this one in the financial part of the presentation.",77,,
650,0.97,4675.27,4678.073,Next please.,77,,
651,0.97,4678.073,4683.445,"And finally, but not at all Finally, we power.",77,,
652,0.97,4683.445,4695.657,"This refers to our core mission of providing our customers with affordable, reliable, and energy environmentally responsible energy services.",77,,
653,0.97,4695.657,4710.238,"In order to do so, we need to make our infrastructure investments.",77,,
654,0.97,4710.238,4715.777,We will be providing transparency through our enhanced Metrics reporting.,77,,
655,0.97,4715.777,4724.619,Another is the Relicensing of our Skagit Hydro project.,77,,
656,0.97,4724.619,4730.492,Now we'll move onto Kristy Grainger.,77,,
657,0.97,4730.492,4730.826,Thank you.,78,,
658,0.97,4730.826,4746.041,So an output of the strategic plan is a six year rate trajectory that outlines the rates that city light would need to support the projects initiatives and activities that we just described.,79,,
659,0.97,4746.041,4752.547,This can be found in Appendix a of our strategic plan.,79,,
660,0.97,4752.547,4762.09,"One, a part of city light's commitment to Affordability is that we're aiming to our plan that looks like inflation.",79,,
661,0.97,4762.09,4777.172,"You can see that for the next six years it calls for a 4.5% average rate increase, and again in 2024, and 3.5% for 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028.",79,,
662,0.97,4777.172,4815.377,"The 4.5% for, that the next two years is higher than what city light had projected, and this is due to the high inflation that we are seeing and I'm sure for anyone who's tracking, this is probably not a surprise, that inflation is Impacting us all right now for city light in particular, the cost of raw materials, copper poles are significant for us right now and are rising quickly, even in the double-digit percentages for some of these items.",79,,
663,0.97,4815.377,4823.552,"So that higher rate increases for 2023, and 2024 reflect the inflation that city light's been seeing for the past several years.",79,,
664,0.97,4823.552,4840.368,"You can see there in the chart on the right, which compares city light's rate path with the consumer price index as published by the city's own office of economic and revenue forecasts that we compare favorably to inflation.",79,,
665,0.97,4840.368,4845.34,"Inflation is high right now, but we're going to try to stay under that.",79,,
666,0.97,4845.34,4852.514,"You can see that for 2020 and 2021, we didn't have a rate increase in 2021 and 3.9% in 2022.",79,,
667,0.97,4852.514,4864.359,So some of the rate increases that we're proposing for the next two years represent a little bit of catching up for the impacts of inflation.,79,,
668,0.97,4864.359,4865.393,"Next slide, please.",79,,
669,0.97,4865.393,4880.709,"Just to provide a little context for what these percentages mean for a typical residential customer and average resident, there will be about $80 a month, and 4.5% increase would be about $4.",79,,
670,0.97,4880.709,4886.948,"I just want to quickly acknowledge that there's a Typo on this slide, that somehow got past all of our review.",79,,
671,0.97,4886.948,4900.562,"You can see that the rate path that we provided on the Bot 0 on half of this table for context, the numbers should be 3.0, so sorry about that, please make a note of that.",79,,
672,0.97,4900.562,4915.076,"The rate increases that we're talking about translate to 3 to $4 a month, and then for customers who are enrolled in the utility discount program, they receive a 60% discount on their bills.",79,,
673,0.97,4915.076,4928.623,"So these rate increases would be $1 $1.50, to $2 range.",79,,
674,0.97,4928.623,4939.1,These provide some context for what that's rate increases look like for them.,79,,
675,0.97,4939.1,4947.876,Any increase to utility electric bills impacts residential and businesses in our community.,79,,
676,0.97,4947.876,4957.986,These impacts are felt for different members of our community and so I just wanted to take one slide to highlight some Affordability programs that we offer here.,79,,
677,0.97,4957.986,4963.091,"So we mentioned the utility discount program, and that's an ongoing 60% discount.",79,,
678,0.97,4963.091,4968.997,We also have several programs for income eligible customers to help customers who are behind on their bills.,79,,
679,0.97,4968.997,4989.25,"And we know that this is an issue right now for approximately 40,000 of our customers, and thank you Councilmember at the beginning for your PSA reminding folks that we are actively out doing outreach to customers below are behind on their bills, but we are not demanding payment.",79,,
680,0.97,4989.25,5007.635,"That really what we're doing is offering assistance, that provides a credit of up to $1,000 for households, as well as Federal programs that can offer credits to heating expenses, as well as a new Washington state funding program.",79,,
681,0.97,5007.635,5018.179,"So we have a lot of help for customers who are behind on their bills, and we really do want to help folks that are behind.",79,,
682,0.97,5018.179,5034.629,"For a lot of folks below may not qualify based on income, we have bill payment programs, and putting together a payment plan that can extend from 60 days out to 2, even 3 years to help them get caught up on their bills.",79,,
683,0.97,5034.629,5042.037,"And both city light and Spu, we have our late fees are waived until June of next year.",79,,
684,0.97,5042.037,5047.409,So we really do want to help customers get up-to-date with their bills.,79,,
685,0.97,5047.409,5053.515,We have a lot of programs to support them.,79,,
686,0.97,5053.515,5068.329,"Oh, and if anybody who's listening in Googles Seattle.Gov utility bill help, and we have a nice web page that will tell folks about these programs.",79,,
687,0.97,5068.329,5074.069,"Finally, I have just one slide that's a bit of a sneak Peek on what happens next.",79,,
688,0.97,5074.069,5078.54,Seattle city light is the budget for our rates proposal.,79,,
689,0.97,5078.54,5083.078,The whole city will be moving into budget in September.,79,,
690,0.97,5083.078,5087.715,And so we are aiming to have approval for the strategic plan.,79,,
691,0.97,5087.715,5099.461,And then we'll be bringing forward a rate ordinance that will set rates for 2023 and 2024 that align with the strategic plan.,79,,
692,0.97,5099.461,5113.808,"And the increases for customer classes, and for individual customers will vary from that 4.5% average, because we're going to be taking into account cost of service and some rate design changes.",79,,
693,0.97,5113.808,5116.611,There will be a big ordinance coming.,79,,
694,0.97,5116.611,5121.015,I think we're aiming to bring this to Committee on August 12th.,79,,
695,0.97,5121.015,5123.751,And we also have exciting stuff coming up with rate design.,79,,
696,0.97,5123.751,5127.922,"A time much day rate option, that we've been working on for some time.",79,,
697,0.97,5127.922,5132.861,So we're excited to bring that back to Committee in August.,79,,
698,0.97,5132.861,5134.095,So that's all of my slides.,79,,
699,0.97,5134.095,5140.635,Is this where we turn it over to Scott?,79,,
700,0.97,5140.635,5141.769,I think so.,80,,
701,0.97,5141.769,5142.47,Okay.,81,,
702,0.97,5142.47,5146.441,"This is Scott, again with the city light review panel.",82,,
703,0.97,5146.441,5165.727,"Our strategic plan is really a team effort between city light staff and our great review panel, which is of nine community members which work hand in hand with us on putting this plan together, so thanks Scott for putting this together today, and talking with us.",82,,
704,0.97,5165.727,5167.462,Thank you.,83,,
705,0.97,5167.462,5170.498,"Good morning, chair Nelson, and committee members.",83,,
706,0.97,5170.498,5170.932,I'm Scott Haskins.,83,,
707,0.97,5170.932,5191.352,"I'm sitting in for the chair of the panel, Michael Hanson, who is not able to be here today, but we all partnership heavily in this process, which I think city council staff and budget office would attest, so it's a privilege to be here.",83,,
708,0.97,5191.352,5201.229,"Just one quick NOTE about the panel, for the nine member panel, five members are nominated by the Mayor's office for by the city council.",83,,
709,0.97,5201.229,5209.804,"I was one of those city council nominees a couple years ago, and each represents a different customer group.",83,,
710,0.97,5209.804,5218.613,"My particular role is looking out for financial analyst, or financial status, and so, I bring some expertise in that regard.",83,,
711,0.97,5218.613,5232.093,I'd like to turn to the strategic plan itself with some brief comments and I have five quick Takeaways that I'd like to mention.,83,,
712,0.97,5232.093,5237.832,"And these come from the panel's letter to Mayor Harrell regarding the plan itself, and the update.",83,,
713,0.97,5237.832,5240.868,And that is attached to the agenda.,84,,
714,0.97,5240.868,5246.808,"For the public, that is attached to the agenda.",84,,
715,0.97,5246.808,5247.942,Yes.,85,,
716,0.97,5247.942,5262.724,"First, I'm pleased to confirm to you that the panel has unanimously endorses the strategic plan update as well as the associated rate path.",86,,
717,0.97,5262.724,5274.035,"Secondly, in our due diligence and our involvement with the utility we believe that the utility is charted.",86,,
718,0.97,5274.035,5294.989,"A course that keeps rate increases as modest as possible, while maintaining basic services, basic core services for customers as well as making necessary investments of capital to the infrastructure and the system.",86,,
719,0.97,5294.989,5308.069,We think that the commitment to keep rates low and the practices we've observed in that regard in impressive and important to the review panel.,86,,
720,0.97,5308.069,5315.343,"We recognize as you do, the third point is that these are very turbulent times.",86,,
721,0.97,5315.343,5318.212,We've heard today about inflation.,86,,
722,0.97,5318.212,5327.021,We've heard about and we're dealing with Seattle city light with supply chain issues.,86,,
723,0.97,5327.021,5351.179,"We're dealing with the economy and we're finding that these costs are very difficult to project with certainty, that there are risks, and that managing in that uncertainty and turbulent times is going forward.",86,,
724,0.97,5351.179,5358.886,We've also observed in our analysis that the utility is aggressively working on workforce issues.,86,,
725,0.97,5358.886,5368.262,"They have a high vacancy rate, but they're working on Redramatic, and employee development, and organizational change management.",86,,
726,0.97,5368.262,5370.131,They're quite focused.,86,,
727,0.97,5370.131,5383.277,"We've heard several presentations on race and social justice program, both with the internal, as well as the external community that they serve.",86,,
728,0.97,5383.277,5405.166,"We think that our role also, going forward is to monitor some key performance Indicaters in terms of how they're doing relative to long term health and projects, hiring service delivery, overall costs and revenues.",86,,
729,0.97,5405.166,5414.609,"The fourth quick Takeaway is that the advisory panel is deeply interested in financial policies, practices and performance.",86,,
730,0.97,5414.609,5420.214,These have been a focus of our panel for several years.,86,,
731,0.97,5420.214,5425.853,And there are a couple action items that are in their plan that you can look forward to seeing.,86,,
732,0.97,5425.853,5432.226,One of those relates to long term debt strategy for the utility.,86,,
733,0.97,5432.226,5439.667,"We're very interested in that, because debt service remains a large component of the rates.",86,,
734,0.97,5439.667,5452.814,"And having electricity rates that are affordable are very important, given the debt position of the utility.",86,,
735,0.97,5452.814,5457.618,So having a clear debt strategy is important for the future.,86,,
736,0.97,5457.618,5463.658,A second action item that you can expect is to hear more from the facility this summer on rate design.,86,,
737,0.97,5463.658,5491.185,"Back in 2019, the review panel at the Council's request submitted a report regarding the desirability of the updating city light's rate design, this was before my tenure on the panel, but we understand that the utility will be coming forward with the design proposal later for you this summer, and we're going to be monitoring that proposal.",86,,
738,0.97,5491.185,5508.603,The last Takeaway and point that I'd be Remiss if I didn't mention was just how impressed we are with utility's current management and leadership.,86,,
739,0.97,5508.603,5517.378,"Debora, with her current staff has a great amount of energy, confidential, leadership, and are very committed to change and improvement.",86,,
740,0.97,5517.378,5523.15,"They want to make things better, and that's evident to us in all the discussions we've had.",86,,
741,0.97,5523.15,5535.563,"Further, I would just add that we don't just go review things, and give an opinion, we partnership actively in discussions with them.",86,,
742,0.97,5535.563,5536.197,We raise issues.,86,,
743,0.97,5536.197,5536.764,We raise questions.,86,,
744,0.97,5536.764,5545.773,"We have comments, and without exception, all of those are taken seriously.",86,,
745,0.97,5545.773,5554.148,"And addressed, so we feel very much in development of the plan and understanding the role we have with the plan.",86,,
746,0.97,5554.148,5563.19,"So with that, that concludes my remarks for today, and I'd be happy to speak with you about any questions that you may have.",86,,
747,0.97,5563.19,5568.195,"Well thank you, Scott.",87,,
748,0.97,5568.195,5575.269,It's important to note that the watchdog experts are happy.,87,,
749,0.97,5575.269,5583.144,And also thank you city light panelists for your detailed overview of the strategic plan.,87,,
750,0.97,5583.144,5586.047,"Again, those documents are linked on the agenda.",87,,
751,0.97,5586.047,5592.019,"I see that Councilmember Herbold has a question, and I have a couple as well.",87,,
752,0.97,5592.019,5592.587,Councilmember Herbold.,87,,
753,0.97,5592.587,5597.124,I do not.,88,,
754,0.97,5597.124,5599.694,I don't have my hand raised.,88,,
755,0.97,5599.694,5601.395,I don't quite see what you're seeing.,88,,
756,0.97,5601.395,5603.764,"I might, but not right out of the gate.",88,,
757,0.97,5603.764,5606.934,For some reason my Curser made a little hand thing.,89,,
758,0.97,5606.934,5611.072,"So anyway, I do have a question.",89,,
759,0.97,5611.072,5629.39,"On page three of Seattle, of the Pdf that's on the agenda, one of the drivers of the increased revenue requirements is an increase in Electrification incentives, and to around 5 million on top of the current 2 million.",89,,
760,0.97,5629.39,5636.964,"I'm just wondering if that will, and you touched on Electrification.",89,,
761,0.97,5636.964,5638.165,On electric vehicle charging station.,89,,
762,0.97,5638.165,5647.608,"I'm assuming, is it correct to assume that a large part of that increase will be going to your electric charging stations?",89,,
763,0.97,5647.608,5653.447,The answer has a number in it.,90,,
764,0.97,5653.447,5654.815,I'm going to ask Kristy to respond.,90,,
765,0.97,5654.815,5660.621,I can speak to it and say yes.,91,,
766,0.97,5660.621,5679.407,"As you know, our transportation electric strategic plan is now in implementation mode and I think we've shared at least with some Councilmembers, I think we shared with all of you that we are piloting right now our residential Street charging program.",91,,
767,0.97,5679.407,5682.743,We're also rolling out a multifamily program.,91,,
768,0.97,5682.743,5699.26,"I think what you'll see is with appropriate funding for 2022, going forward, the increased funding, our goal is to really out there providing incentives and encouraging folks to adopt Electrification.",91,,
769,0.97,5699.26,5706.0,"We're also looking, we have some preliminary plans, but this is an area where we're laser focused.",91,,
770,0.97,5706.0,5707.635,We certainly understand that.,91,,
771,0.97,5707.635,5720.481,"It is often our most economically affluent customers who can afford electric vehicles, so we are looking at a host of our opportunities, including electric bikes so we can provide benefits and access to all of our customers.",91,,
772,0.97,5720.481,5721.749,So more to come on that.,91,,
773,0.97,5721.749,5731.192,"I think what you will see is we'll continue to share out with you, as we launch new programs, and expect to see those this year and next.",91,,
774,0.97,5731.192,5736.13,Did you want to add something to that?,91,,
775,0.97,5736.13,5737.398,"No, it's a great question.",92,,
776,0.97,5737.398,5737.731,Thank you.,92,,
777,0.97,5737.731,5744.605,And you're right to observe that those incentives that $5 million is money that we're looking to get out of the community.,92,,
778,0.97,5744.605,5753.647,"So we are building charging stations, but we're also looking to work to build charging infrastructure all over the community.",92,,
779,0.97,5753.647,5757.818,So those dollars we will be getting out into the community.,92,,
780,0.97,5757.818,5758.452,Thank you.,93,,
781,0.97,5758.452,5775.87,"This is a topic, that I'm very much interested in, our Seattle climate action plan does say it has for a goal that 15% of passenger cars in Seattle should be running on clean electricity by 2030.",93,,
782,0.97,5775.87,5784.912,"That's about 60,000 vehicles, and I think they're about 15,000 vehicles right now that are electric on our roads.",93,,
783,0.97,5784.912,5787.715,One way to get there is to expand our Ev charging network.,93,,
784,0.97,5787.715,5790.551,So thank you very much for your work on that.,93,,
785,0.97,5790.551,5805.466,"And we also have to recognize that the utility and the rate payers can't afford to do all this work and ensure that these charging stations are accessible everywhere on our own, as a city.",93,,
786,0.97,5805.466,5813.807,"So we're going to have to also Incentivize private Venders as well, and I'm working on some legislation for that, so stay tuned on that.",93,,
787,0.97,5813.807,5818.779,"Councilmember, just if I could, you just touched on something really important.",94,,
788,0.97,5818.779,5819.48,That is our strategy.,94,,
789,0.97,5819.48,5826.587,"Our strategy in general is to lean into the private sector, and we have made changes in the WY we approach.",94,,
790,0.97,5826.587,5851.979,"We have a desk that deals full time with the requests and asks from that network of charging entities, because we feel like having them come in and then what we intend to do is to continue to use public funds to fill in the blanks, so where are there locations and areas in our service territory for whatever reason, the private sector is not as interested.",94,,
791,0.97,5851.979,5853.48,That's where public charging becomes critically important.,94,,
792,0.97,5853.48,5874.268,"We will continue to fill that need, and we will also be continuing to look at whether the notion of charging stations for instance at community centers is that feasible at those locations where there is room, et cetera, so we are fully aligned with your goals there, and I think we're all on the same page.",94,,
793,0.97,5874.268,5874.568,Great.,95,,
794,0.97,5874.568,5879.807,"Councilmember Herbold, you have a real hand up.",96,,
795,0.97,5879.807,5880.875,I certainly do.,97,,
796,0.97,5880.875,5883.244,Thank you so much.,97,,

798,0.97,5916.31,5924.018,518 of your presentation includes information about a variety of bill payment support programs.,97,,
799,0.97,5924.018,5930.457,"And I'm just wondering, can you explain if some of these programs are going to be sun setting, and when?",97,,
800,0.97,5930.457,5957.418,"And how you're going to Prioritize accounts for collections and what measures you will be taking up, not only to avoid collections, but as we all agree to avoid cutoffs of electricity for unpaid bills.",97,,

802,0.97,5960.721,5966.093,"In general, what is important to know is we're not interested in shutting customers off.",98,,
803,0.97,5966.093,5969.563,What we're interested in is having conversations with customers.,98,,
804,0.97,5969.563,5973.133,We will feel successful if in fact we don't shut anyone off.,98,,
805,0.97,5973.133,5985.579,"Because what we want is we've got a plan in place that offers very, very generous, custom tailored payment solutions to customers.",98,,

809,0.97,6002.93,6012.139,We you understanded ended up at a top notch plan for a shared page for information.,98,,
810,0.97,6012.139,6013.44,We're working with customers Collaboratively.,98,,
811,0.97,6013.44,6021.081,"They already come into the same context center, so we have aligned our programs as best as we can.",98,,

816,0.97,6051.211,6053.38,But we have no Timeline associated with that.,98,,
817,0.97,6053.38,6058.152,What we've done at this point is simply to say this is where we're starting.,98,,
818,0.97,6058.152,6062.923,We're going to learn from our experience.,98,,
819,0.97,6062.923,6084.611,"Learn from the outreach, and we have thoughtful, we think about sunset dates, but again, we are at the very, very beginning of this process, and we're really most interested in seeing what's successful, and then Mking Tweaks to our program offerings, as we need to, in order to Encouragecustomers to call us and make arrangements.",98,,
820,0.97,6084.611,6098.826,"I don't know if that answers your questions, but it's very customer focused, and I think it is always good to notice and make sure Y'all know that we did a lot of work with Udp customers on the back end of this year and last year.",98,,
821,0.97,6098.826,6105.332,"We applied the monies that you graciously gave us, allocated to us out of the Corona relief funds.",98,,

823,0.97,6115.042,6117.177,We also applied emergency assistance programs.,98,,
824,0.97,6117.177,6120.013,I built the Seattle and SPD light bills.,98,,
825,0.97,6120.013,6130.591,We will continue to Prioritize our lowest income customers and make sure they are not jeopardized while we work on these larger balances to bring them down.,98,,
826,0.97,6130.591,6144.805,"The other thing that's always worth noting is we do have a responsibility as a public utility who serves all customers to make efforts to collect past due receivables, so we are doing that.",98,,
827,0.97,6144.805,6153.981,"Please know we have financially reserved most of that large amount, which means there isn't, and that was in last years's financial statements.",98,,
828,0.97,6153.981,6170.597,"As we recover funds, assuming that we do, and I know we will, as we recover funds, those actually benefit us, but we've actually already reserved the funds, so we're not at risk of a big write down for past due, or Uncollective receivables.",98,,
829,0.97,6170.597,6174.268,That's already been taken care of.,98,,
830,0.97,6174.268,6174.535,Yeah.,99,,
831,0.97,6174.535,6175.002,I guess a follow up.,99,,
832,0.97,6175.002,6178.739,"I'm just again returning not on the slide, Eric.",99,,
833,0.97,6178.739,6213.54,"But [inaudible] the social staff's memo, it says again, that restarting collection practices means shutting off power for unpaid bills, after giving customers the ability--I'm just trying to get a little more clarity on how and when the current practices, obviously, they're Covid emergency related practices, where you have agreed to not shut off people's utilities.",99,,
834,0.97,6213.54,6216.343,How we can expect those to change and evolve.,99,,
835,0.97,6216.343,6224.351,"As you know, the moratorium on Shutoffs ended, the Mayor's office allowed that executive order to end in April.",100,,
836,0.97,6224.351,6227.521,"So right now, we are simply communicating with people.",100,,
837,0.97,6227.521,6234.027,The soonest we would be shutting any customers off is April or later.,100,,
838,0.97,6234.027,6244.838,"Our hope was that we could work, we could Insent as many customers as possible before we go into a winter weather moratorium.",100,,
839,0.97,6244.838,6252.546,"As soon as we start to see temperatures drop, of course we don't Disconnect customers, so we wind up with a fairly big gap.",100,,
840,0.97,6252.546,6260.787,"So the idea here, and I know that you want a more definitive answer than Maybe I'm able to give you Councilmember, and I apologize.",100,,
841,0.97,6260.787,6269.997,"One thing we could do, is we could provide a briefing with Spu, because our plans are very well aligned, and I know you continue to track on Spu.",100,,
842,0.97,6269.997,6275.535,So that would be something we could do.,100,,
843,0.97,6275.535,6282.075,But I--so what Eric has provided in the memo is a definition.,100,,
844,0.97,6282.075,6283.71,So it's a definition.,100,,
845,0.97,6283.71,6286.546,"What does credit, what do credit Disconnects mean?",100,,
846,0.97,6286.546,6290.617,That is where they ultimately go.,100,,
847,0.97,6290.617,6308.969,"But again, in this instance, we think we'll be able to Proactively, most customers will be Insented, most customers will be allowed up to three years.",100,,
848,0.97,6308.969,6315.842,We work for something that works for them where they feel able to pay off those bills overtime.,100,,
849,0.97,6315.842,6321.381,"In terms of when that ends, there is no date.",100,,
850,0.97,6321.381,6324.151,We're just going to be tracking what we do.,100,,
851,0.97,6324.151,6327.654,And we'll talk about if and when we choose to move that number down.,100,,
852,0.97,6327.654,6346.139,"That's really the best I can give you, because we are in Unchartered territory, and again, if we're successful, and our current plan results in a lot of activity, a lot of customer Callins, then that's what we'll stick with.",100,,
853,0.97,6346.139,6346.973,"Again, that's the goal.",100,,
854,0.97,6346.973,6357.918,"I think that you know, and folks generally know, that we have not, at City light, we have not disconnected customers for nonpayment since 2016.",100,,
855,0.97,6357.918,6360.887,"For us, it is a really heavy lift to get back to that.",100,,
856,0.97,6360.887,6386.413,"We not only need to work with customers who accrued large overdue bills because of Covid, or the economic impacts of Covid, but we also need to work with customers to retrain them, and to Reinsent them.",100,,
857,0.97,6386.413,6388.048,And we're very mindful of that.,100,,
858,0.97,6388.048,6392.519,"As Scott mentioned, improving our business strategies is one of our top business strategies.",100,,
859,0.97,6392.519,6400.627,So we really want to do this in a way that feels respectful to customers.,100,,
860,0.97,6400.627,6410.07,"We're trying to work with people--all of our materials are available in many, many languages.",100,,
861,0.97,6410.07,6412.973,So we're trying to work with people to move this issue forward.,100,,
862,0.97,6412.973,6440.467,"I really appreciate that, and I appreciate the briefing on yours and SPD's work in this area, but I just want to--you're saying on one hand, there have been no Shutoffs since 2016, and on the other hand there may be Shutoffs, so I want to understand what the policy may be.",101,,
863,0.97,6440.467,6449.342,"In addition to a briefing, we can offer you some written materials that show it more clearly.",102,,
864,0.97,6449.342,6449.709,Thank you.,103,,
865,0.97,6449.709,6450.11,The Timeline.,104,,
866,0.97,6450.11,6453.313,I think SPD and city light are on the same Timeline.,104,,
867,0.97,6453.313,6457.551,"So we'll take that as an assignment, and make sure you get that.",104,,
868,0.97,6457.551,6473.133,"But again, it's August, where there could be customers who have not reached out to us at all, who have been Nonresponsive to our attempts to communicate with them, who at this point, have a past due balance of over $1,000.",104,,
869,0.97,6473.133,6478.672,Those are the folks who could wind up receiving shutoff notices late this summer.,104,,
870,0.97,6478.672,6487.08,"Okay, the offer, and I'll be taking you up on it.",105,,
871,0.97,6487.08,6487.447,Appreciate it.,105,,
872,0.97,6487.447,6487.747,Thank you.,105,,
873,0.97,6487.747,6496.089,"Eric, do you have anything to add to that, or anything else in this strategic plan?",106,,
874,0.97,6496.089,6496.389,No.,107,,
875,0.97,6496.389,6509.236,The only thing that might have been mentioned is city light with the other utilities are waiting to hear from the Department of Commerce about the amount of the awards.,107,,
876,0.97,6509.236,6510.904,There's $100 million in the fund.,107,,
877,0.97,6510.904,6516.91,"A significant amount of money, my best guess is our utilities will receive a large share of that.",107,,
878,0.97,6516.91,6521.281,That will help a lot in customers experiencing difficulties with their bills as a result of Covid.,107,,
879,0.97,6521.281,6531.424,"So there will be an opportunity to be briefed about what do utilities get, how is it being delivered?",107,,
880,0.97,6531.424,6534.761,And I think this committee or perhaps customer members can look forward to that.,107,,
881,0.97,6534.761,6540.233,Thank you for bringing it up.,108,,
882,0.97,6540.233,6549.476,"What's true is the Corona relief funds had to be applied, and could only be applied to city of Seattle customers, just due to the nature of the funding.",108,,
883,0.97,6549.476,6554.281,"What we appreciate and why what Eric just mentioned is critically important, two reasons.",108,,
884,0.97,6554.281,6570.363,"One is we believe we will receive a fairly significant amount of funding because in this instance, those funds are restricted, and they need to be used for, there is a requirement that the past two balances be accrued after a set date.",108,,
885,0.97,6570.363,6578.939,And many of our sister and brother utilities across the state began resuming collection activities prior to that date.,108,,
886,0.97,6578.939,6581.775,So that means they won't be eligible for funds.,108,,
887,0.97,6581.775,6586.479,"So we have learned that, and we think more funding will go to us.",108,,
888,0.97,6586.479,6600.86,"The other thing that's critically important about this, it will allow us to do the kinds of things on the back end for customers, especially low income customer who is qualify for these Fundings who are in our suburban franchise cities.",108,,
889,0.97,6600.86,6608.268,"So we weren't able to offer any help to those customers, and we will be able to use the state funding.",108,,
890,0.97,6608.268,6617.811,We believe that the combination of those two things will at least allow us to have most of our lowest income customers in a good place.,108,,
891,0.97,6617.811,6619.646,"Then, of course, Udp is perspective going forward.",108,,
892,0.97,6619.646,6631.758,"So if we're able to clean up past due balances that they're continuing to benefit from the discount, we at least believe we can keep those customers out of a collection cycle.",108,,
893,0.97,6631.758,6643.403,"So the staff members working on this, Leslie Benson and from Seattle city light.",108,,
894,0.97,6643.403,6645.171,Thank you very much.,109,,
895,0.97,6645.171,6645.839,We're behind schedule.,109,,
896,0.97,6645.839,6650.443,"If there aren't any questions, I would like to move on.",109,,
897,0.97,6650.443,6655.548,"Let's see, will the clerk please read agenda item three into the record?",109,,
898,0.97,6655.548,6660.12,"And thank you, very, very much panelists and Debora.",109,,
899,0.97,6660.12,6661.121,Excellent.,109,,
900,0.97,6661.121,6663.623,"Again, we'll take this up again on the 13th.",109,,
901,0.97,6663.623,6672.332,"In the meantime, I encourage everyone to get questions to city light.",109,,
902,0.97,6672.332,6683.61,"Councilmember, if I could really quick, the transportation strategic investment plan, it's coming just with an update to Committee on July 22nd.",110,,
903,0.97,6683.61,6700.76,"If you have specific questions or areas you want us to cover with respect, if you'll have your staff let us know, so we'll have it covered when we bring you the overall update.",110,,
904,0.97,6700.76,6703.63,Thank you.,111,,
905,0.97,6703.63,6708.234,"Okay, go ahead.",111,,

910,0.97,6763.089,6764.357,Thank you very much.,113,,
911,0.97,6764.357,6770.33,"This item needs no introduction from me, except the Teaser I gave at the beginning of the meeting.",113,,
912,0.97,6770.33,6784.244,"So I will let you take it away after you introduce yourselves and because we are running late, I want to confirm that my colleagues can stay through the end of this item.",113,,
913,0.97,6784.244,6786.88,Because we're down to three.,113,,
914,0.97,6786.88,6787.447,Is that okay?,113,,
915,0.97,6787.447,6788.548,Seeing no objection.,113,,
916,0.97,6788.548,6791.251,"So I won't take any time then either, Councilmember.",114,,
917,0.97,6791.251,6793.887,I'll just turn this over to staff.,114,,
918,0.97,6793.887,6797.457,"But this is super exciting, and we are appreciative of your willingness to stay.",114,,
919,0.97,6797.457,6806.199,This is something that the city of Seattle can and should feel very good about our ability to help influence a long term outcome from our state.,114,,
920,0.97,6806.199,6809.669,"So with that, I'm going to turn it over to the team.",114,,
921,0.97,6809.669,6821.314,"Good morning Councilmember, Mike Haynes, I'm the assistant general manager with Seattle city light.",115,,
922,0.97,6821.314,6821.748,Maura Grouper.,116,,
923,0.97,6821.748,6822.148,Kate Engel.,117,,
924,0.97,6822.148,6826.753,I also serve as the U.S.,117,,
925,0.97,6826.753,6831.424,Secretary to the Skagit environmental endowment Commission.,117,,
926,0.97,6831.424,6831.758,Go ahead.,118,,
927,0.97,6831.758,6832.859,So good morning.,119,,
928,0.97,6832.859,6838.698,I'm very happy to present this piece of legislation to you all this morning.,119,,
929,0.97,6838.698,6849.742,"It's a very exciting time for city light and for the Skagit environmental endowment Commission and for the province of British Columbia right now, as it SINKS in with the U.S.",119,,
930,0.97,6849.742,6856.416,"And the country of Canada, they'll be large celebrations at those levels of government as well.",119,,
931,0.97,6856.416,6860.386,So a little bit of background on what we're talking about today.,119,,
932,0.97,6860.386,6868.695,I'll be talking about the high Ross treaty and agreement that provides the foundation for the decision to be made today.,119,,
933,0.97,6868.695,6873.7,Also be talking about the Skagit environmental endowment Commission which came out of that treaty.,119,,
934,0.97,6873.7,6879.072,"And the infamous Donut hole, which some of you may have read about.",119,,
935,0.97,6879.072,6890.35,"Then I'll pass the presentation onto Maura, and go over the history of threats and actions to protect the Donut hole as well as the current status of those actions, and the purpose of this ordinance.",119,,
936,0.97,6890.35,6891.718,Next please.,119,,
937,0.97,6891.718,6900.426,"So a little bit on the high Ross treaty, as most of you are probably aware, there's three dams on the Skagit River.",119,,
938,0.97,6900.426,6906.566,"The last dam that was constructed, and the northern most dam is the Ross dam.",119,,
939,0.97,6906.566,6922.081,It's kind of uniquely constructed dam that was designed to be heightened at several different stages to get to what they call the high Ross stage that is the point of controversy here.,119,,
940,0.97,6922.081,6934.36,"The dam was started to be constructed about 1937, and it made it through the first couple of stages to stage three in about 1950 or so.",119,,
941,0.97,6934.36,6939.699,"Then in 1970, Seattle city light pursued increasing the height of the dam.",119,,
942,0.97,6939.699,6943.603,"The last stage, stage four.",119,,
943,0.97,6943.603,6946.839,That's where everything started to blow up.,119,,
944,0.97,6946.839,6964.524,"So what that meant if city light had increased the dam height at that time would be that the reservoir, Ross Lake, Ross reservoir above the dam would have been extended up into Canada, about three miles flooding the Skagit River and surrounding lands.",119,,
945,0.97,6964.524,6969.996,And that was not--that was a problem.,119,,
946,0.97,6969.996,6980.44,Particularly brought forth by the conservation organizations on the BC side of the Skagit watershed due to the environmental damage that would occur because of that flooding.,119,,
947,0.97,6980.44,6989.682,So this controversy ended up being settled in 1984 with agreement between the city of Seattle and the BC province.,119,,
948,0.97,6989.682,6996.956,And then supported by a treaty between the U.S. and Canada to make sure that that agreement is fulfilled.,119,,
949,0.97,6996.956,7004.831,"So this agreement is an 80 year agreement, and a couple highlights of it, on the BC side.",119,,
950,0.97,7004.831,7017.643,"First City light would not be heightening the dam, and that the BC government would be providing electricity to offset the electricity generation that wasn't realized by heightening the dam.",119,,
951,0.97,7017.643,7024.65,"And attempt, to address the environmental concerns that were brought out about this.",119,,
952,0.97,7024.65,7031.057,They established the Skagit endowment fund with seed money from--hang on.,119,,
953,0.97,7031.057,7058.651,"With seed money from the city of Seattle and the BC province, and that money is being used to pour the environmental integrity of the watershed, and it's being Overseen by and established by the Skagit environmental endowment Commission.",119,,
954,0.97,7058.651,7077.57,"It's a Commission of 16 commissioners, eight who are appointed by the Premier of British Columbia and eight by Seattle.",119,,
955,0.97,7077.57,7084.444,"In the form of two secretaries, as I mentioned earlier, I'm on the U.S. side providing the administrative support to the Commissioner.",119,,
956,0.97,7084.444,7088.981,"I have a partner on the BC side, supporting the BC side as well.",119,,
957,0.97,7088.981,7092.618,And we work to provide everything that the Commissioner needs.,119,,
958,0.97,7092.618,7107.934,"These commissioners are appointed on four year terms that are staggered, so there's a constant Cycling of new commissioners in and out, and the administration is more between the bricks and the liaison to make things happen.",119,,
959,0.97,7107.934,7120.847,"The Commission is supposed to make the funds from the endowment fund to preserve and protect wildness habitat, enhance recreational opportunities.",119,,
960,0.97,7120.847,7133.593,"I won't go through them all, but I'll point out the third one, which is the subject of today's decision, which is their directive to acquire mineral, or timber rates.",119,,
961,0.97,7133.593,7134.26,"Next slide, please.",119,,
962,0.97,7134.26,7135.862,This brings me to the Donut hole.,119,,
963,0.97,7135.862,7151.01,"So as you can see on the map here, we've got a picture of the Skagit watershed in darker color on the left hand side there, with a square red box, kind of blown up on the right to show the exact location of the Donut hole.",119,,
964,0.97,7151.01,7157.85,The Donut hole is the Red area on the BC side there.,119,,
965,0.97,7157.85,7166.125,"It's situated between two provincial parks, Manning park on the right hand side, and Skagit Valley park on the right hand side.",119,,
966,0.97,7166.125,7173.833,"The Donut hole is a 14,000-Acre area that has mineral Tenures associated with it.",119,,
967,0.97,7173.833,7188.814,"Moist recently owned by Imperial metals, and it could not be incorporated into the Skagit Valley provincial park as intended because of those outstanding mineral Tenures.",119,,
968,0.97,7188.814,7201.327,It became the charge of SEEC from its Insection to retire those mineral Tenures so that area could be incorporated into the park.,119,,
969,0.97,7201.327,7215.775,"Throughout the rest of the watershed down to Ross dam, it's got the protection of this Ross Lake recreational area as well as the North cascades National Park complex.",119,,
970,0.97,7215.775,7221.681,So to kind of complete the circle.,119,,
971,0.97,7221.681,7222.648,"Next slide, please.",119,,
972,0.97,7222.648,7229.088,So eloquently put by Tom Uniac in his comments to complete this session today.,119,,
973,0.97,7229.088,7235.995,"The watershed, the entire scheduled watershed is a local, regional, national significance on both sides of the border.",119,,
974,0.97,7235.995,7252.678,That's what was the cause of all the public outcry when all these different activities have been proposed because of the potential impacts to it and what it provides.,119,,
975,0.97,7252.678,7268.961,The watershed has the largest and healthiest populations of threatened endangered Steelhead and Chinook salmon in the United States.,119,,
976,0.97,7268.961,7270.997,Also of regional national importance.,119,,
977,0.97,7270.997,7276.469,And it also has the most large and diverse population of Bull Trout.,119,,
978,0.97,7276.469,7284.677,"90% of which spawned above Ross dam, and it's critical for grizzly bears and spotted Owls and so forth.",119,,
979,0.97,7284.677,7299.692,"So the threat of mining within those, the mining Tenures of the Donut hole present a significant threat to the river as the toxins from mining would cause significant damage, particularly to the Aquatic resources in the area.",119,,
980,0.97,7299.692,7304.664,"With that, I'll pass it on to talk about more about what we did to address it.",119,,
981,0.97,7304.664,7315.307,"I'm not going to go into all the details, because it's been quite an exciting past few years.",120,,
982,0.97,7315.307,7324.884,"But as Kate had mentioned, the SEEC had always been intending to close up the Donut hole in Manning, and Skagit parks.",120,,
983,0.97,7324.884,7340.733,"It took off in 2014 with the Mount Poly mine disaster when a dam failed and 8 million cubic feet of mining waste was released into adjacent Lakes, causing horrific environmental damage.",120,,
984,0.97,7340.733,7365.391,"So that really was a catalyst for the SEEC to start to take action to reach out to the Mayor of Seattle's office as well as starting to engage directly with the BC Premier's office on their interest of securing a deal with Imperial metals to surrender those mineral rights, knowing it was going to cost money and trying to figure out how to get a price out of Imperial metals.",120,,
985,0.97,7365.391,7374.367,"Then in 2018, things heat up even further, because BC issued a logging permit.",120,,
986,0.97,7374.367,7385.411,"It also established logging roads, so again, there was concern that this was going to make it that much easier for Imperial metals.",120,,
987,0.97,7385.411,7395.521,The treaty was instrumental in our communications between the Mayor's office and the BC premiers office.,120,,
988,0.97,7395.521,7403.662,"Premier Horgan took a real interest in wanting to address the concerns and find a way forward to protect that area, and close up the Donut hole.",120,,
989,0.97,7403.662,7413.038,"Also, as Tom Uniac, who was on earlier with public comment, he led the creation of a coalition that was very successful.",120,,
990,0.97,7413.038,7414.373,Strong collaboration with U.S.,120,,
991,0.97,7414.373,7419.712,"Tribes and first nations, as well as environmental organizations.",120,,
992,0.97,7419.712,7431.157,"We have engagement from our congressional delegation, state Legislature, and of course the Seattle city council members were quite active as well in communicating.",120,,
993,0.97,7431.157,7442.501,"In 2019, Imperial metals did submit an Exploretory permit.",120,,
994,0.97,7442.501,7449.341,We really Ratcheted up our engagement in responding to the permit application.,120,,
995,0.97,7449.341,7450.543,We had engagement from region 10.,120,,
996,0.97,7450.543,7462.855,"We had engagement from the national parks service, as well as the state agencies, and again all of the coalition members Commenting on why that mining permit should not be issued.",120,,
997,0.97,7462.855,7467.693,Covid shut things down for a while.,120,,
998,0.97,7467.693,7471.096,"We kept checking, but nothing had happened.",120,,
999,0.97,7471.096,7480.239,"We discussed this with the BC Premier Horgan's office, and Governor Inslee got engaged as well, reaching out to Premier Horgan.",120,,
1000,0.97,7480.239,7503.796,"Ultimately, they were able to come to an agreement, and engage Imperial metals, and in 2022, SEEC and BC signed an agreement for them to surrender their Imperial metals for 1.1 million U.S., that involved both Canadian contributions as well as U.S. contributions.",120,,
1001,0.97,7503.796,7506.465,That's why we're here today.,120,,
1002,0.97,7506.465,7508.667,There's just a couple of articles.,120,,
1003,0.97,7508.667,7516.575,"We got very good press Cove Raj, again, helping to put pressure on the government in order to find a solution.",120,,
1004,0.97,7516.575,7516.976,Next slide.,120,,
1005,0.97,7516.976,7531.557,"So what we're here to do today, first, SEEC and city light signed an agreement back in late 2021, because this deal was being discussed, and we agreed to $1.25 million from city light.",120,,
1006,0.97,7531.557,7539.698,"The state agreed to $4.5 million, and they would contribute that via city light through a state grant.",120,,
1007,0.97,7539.698,7547.473,The legislature took action on that state grant in March of 2022 in the supplemental budget.,120,,
1008,0.97,7547.473,7553.679,We have a draft that we're prepared to sign when we have permission.,120,,
1009,0.97,7553.679,7571.964,"We also sought and received a letter from the environment and climate provision, to making clear their intentions are to be able to close up the Donut hole, and permanently protect it after with the surrender of the mineral rights, which has happened.",120,,
1010,0.97,7571.964,7591.517,"So this ordinance for you today, thank you for staying, is to execute the grant agreement, so it authorizes us to sign the grant agreement at the state, and convey that payment to the SEEC, and to the SEEC and city light that addresses the expectation from the funding as well.",120,,
1011,0.97,7591.517,7591.817,That's it.,120,,
1012,0.97,7591.817,7596.422,Thank you so much.,120,,
1013,0.97,7596.422,7597.89,If you have any questions.,120,,
1014,0.97,7597.89,7599.725,Thank you very much.,121,,
1015,0.97,7599.725,7611.236,This is an amazingly happy ending to years of hard work in collaboration.,121,,
1016,0.97,7611.236,7614.606,"So I thank you very, very much.",121,,
1017,0.97,7614.606,7617.443,This is an amazing end.,121,,
1018,0.97,7617.443,7627.82,"In fact, Tom Muniac, who spoke earlier, is the one who spearheaded outreach to the brewing community, because you know, no clean water, no beer.",121,,
1019,0.97,7627.82,7635.761,"So he reached out to many, many, many brewery owners, and I was one of many who signed a letter of support for this.",121,,
1020,0.97,7635.761,7640.966,So it's interesting to see it come full circle.,121,,
1021,0.97,7640.966,7646.305,"All right, are there any questions from my colleagues and questions for Eric?",121,,
1022,0.97,7646.305,7652.244,"I have no additional comments, thank you.",122,,
1023,0.97,7652.244,7652.645,Thank you.,123,,
1024,0.97,7652.645,7669.294,"Okay, well then I am thrilled to move that the committee recommends passage of Council bill 120349.",123,,
1025,0.97,7669.294,7670.029,Is there a second?,123,,
