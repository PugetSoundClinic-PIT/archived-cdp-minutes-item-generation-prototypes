16,0.97,204.47,220.453,"For timing, the executive requested consideration before the budget because they expect construction to take approximately one year and the goal is to have the improvements completed before the arena reopens, anticipated in September 2021 and thank you Council President Gonzales for scheduling for the next week's agenda.",3,,

23,0.97,377.043,387.086,"We were lucky no one got hurt and the timing of the collapse was shocking as there was 15,000 square feet of concrete that collapsed within seconds and more than was planned for.",3,,
24,0.97,387.086,414.08,The Park superintendent in the office of the waterfront director woo were spoken too late last night and they assured me that the fire Department treated the injured workers and they were taken to Harborview for complete Checkups and I'm reporting they are doing fine and I'm deeply grateful to the first responders who arrived swiftly to ensure their safety.,3,,

34,0.97,555.788,568.601,Thank you Councilmember Juarez for that report and we appreciate you highlighting and providing the additional information about the incident at Pier 58 and thank you so much for that.,4,,
35,0.97,568.601,579.812,"Really grateful to hear that there wasn't more significant injuries and that there is a clear plan, in terms of addressing the ongoing tenuous nature of that infrastructure.",4,,
36,0.97,579.812,581.213,We really appreciate you giving us information about that.,4,,
37,0.97,581.213,587.453,And a colleagues or questions on that report?,4,,
38,0.97,587.453,599.732,"Hearing none, we will move down the roll call list and next up is Councilmember Lewis and then we will hear from Councilmember Juarez.",4,,
39,0.97,599.732,605.972,There is a lot on my list today but I will try to move forward with it expeditiously.,5,,
40,0.97,605.972,633.866,"First, I do have a bill on a resolution on the Council bill 119-869, providing for a certain enforcement measures and revisions to Seattle municipal code rescissions as based on accountability for violating executive orders.",5,,
41,0.97,633.866,654.72,I discussed this a little bit on Friday at the government committee chaired by Madam president and I appreciate the invitation to go and talk about that legislation.,5,,
42,0.97,654.72,659.525,Karina is present from central staff to answer technical questions if folks want to ask technical questions during briefing this morning.,5,,
43,0.97,659.525,700.566,"I would say briefly, as I said at the Committee on Friday, that this came about because I did not see in the municipal code a lot of satisfactory ways to force these emergency provisions as related to corporate actors, in particular, considering that we've had lots of regulations through the restaurant caps and the premium pay and things that address big multinational corporations and that the only provision for insert municipal code is outdated and archaic criminal misdemeanor from the 1970s.",5,,
44,0.97,700.566,706.138,"Presumably, it won't be a big deterrent to Grubhub or other actors to potentially not violate some of these orders.",5,,
45,0.97,706.138,736.702,"This legislation would simplify that from a sort of--something halfway between a misdemeanor to a simple misdemeanor and it would also add a private right of action for private parties who have been wronged by actors who aren't following the order, to sue that corporate actor in court.",5,,
46,0.97,736.702,738.604,I want to clarify because there's been confusion.,5,,
47,0.97,738.604,740.573,The private right of action is not against the city of Seattle.,5,,
48,0.97,740.573,750.449,It would be against a corporation that is not following the emergency orders.,5,,
49,0.97,750.449,758.991,"The legislation would also add a civil penalty, which could be assessed in lieu by the city against an actor for violating the order instead of a criminal sanction.",5,,
50,0.97,758.991,765.798,That would be a class 1 civil infraction.,5,,
51,0.97,765.798,793.392,"As to the resolution, resolution 319-66, this resolution--I'm going to pool from this afternoon's calendar, the Mayor's office has said they are happy to Promulgate a new order that is cognizant of the ordinance . I think that might be a cleaner way to do it, anyway.",5,,
52,0.97,793.392,832.198,"That will happen sometime this week and my office will be coordinating with them to make sure it gets out there and the resolution is no longer necessary . moving on to talking about various issues relating to the air quality in the city of Seattle right now, I was happy to see over the weekend, that the city and King County stood up an emergency shelter in Sodo for our neighbors experiencing homelessness to get inside, out of the hazardous level of air quality.",5,,
53,0.97,832.198,835.868,"This shelter space can support 80 individuals and I emphasize the inadequacy of our response, so far.",5,,
54,0.97,835.868,843.609,But I'm appreciative that there is at least one shelter open.,5,,
55,0.97,843.609,866.398,The human services Department has assured me that they will continue to monitor if folks are getting into that resource and taking advantage of it and I continue to urge the county and the city to seek and open and scale up more emergency shelter spaces.,5,,
56,0.97,866.398,877.209,It's evident the smoke will be with us for a much longer period of time than just the weekend . It appears it will settle in for the week.,5,,
57,0.97,877.209,884.016,One particular area of discussion has been some potential sites on the Seattle center campus in district 7 and I'm extremely supportive of that.,5,,
58,0.97,884.016,909.675,"The city recently stood down some temporary shelter spaces at exposition hall on the Seattle center campus and I know that the armory on Seattle center campus has been mentioned as a potential spot . I continue to urge the executive and King County to take advantage of those resources, as well as additional ones.",5,,
59,0.97,909.675,914.68,This is extremely urgent and we need to be moving on it.,5,,
60,0.97,914.68,933.198,"The Washington air quality advisory, a tool I wasn't aware of until this weekend, indicates that good air quality, as a score on that tool, it's a score of 1-50 and very unhealthy as a score of 201 to 300.",5,,
61,0.97,933.198,939.138,"As of talking in this briefing, the Washington air quality advisory is above 300.",5,,
62,0.97,939.138,946.278,"It's 309, indicating a hazardous level of air in the city of Seattle.",5,,
63,0.97,946.278,953.118,"This is something that will be settling in that we have to deal with every summer from now on, as a city.",5,,
64,0.97,953.118,960.426,For the last couple of summers we've had big fires and this is a particularly bad fire season.,5,,
65,0.97,960.426,972.404,"There is no reason to believe that this will not, unfortunately, continue, given the pace of global climate change and we need to have a strategy the same way we have a strategy for snow days or other disasters.",5,,
66,0.97,972.404,983.582,"I look forward to working with the executive to develop responses like that, given that this will be an ongoing hazard and something we need to continue to address.",5,,
67,0.97,983.582,991.724,"I think Councilmember Juarez for her update on Pier 58, a public accident in district 7.",5,,
68,0.97,991.724,1009.174,"Unfortunately, it resulted in a workplace accident where the pier fell into Elliott Bay and I'm grateful to know there was no serious injury despite the trauma of the collapse.",5,,
69,0.97,1009.174,1023.722,"But, related to the hazardous air, I address that we had city contractors doing city work in air that was deemed hazardous by the state of Washington.",5,,
70,0.97,1023.722,1052.017,"In addition to talking about emergency procedures to treat these Air-Quality Influxes like a snow day or like a disaster that would be caused by snow, where we have quick responses, it's critical that we talk about the potential workplace hazards for certain jobs.",5,,
71,0.97,1052.017,1060.926,"Out in the environment, doing work they have to do outside.",5,,
72,0.97,1060.926,1087.953,"For hazards that control power lines and for the vaults, and knowing that working families have parents doing that work out in the world, exposed to potentially hazardous air quality during the summer when there are major Wildfires in the region.",5,,
73,0.97,1087.953,1099.164,"This is something we need to address as a city and not just our own employees, but for working in the private sector that don't have a choice.",5,,
74,0.97,1099.164,1103.368,It's something where folks should not be working in these hazardous conditions.,5,,
75,0.97,1103.368,1114.179,"If they are, they should get paid commensurate with the additional risk they are taking and I think that's another thing we need to work on as a city.",5,,
76,0.97,1114.179,1133.198,"For our part of our lives going forward, unfortunately, this is a part of life and with that, I don't have any additional updates, Madam President . I know Karina is here if there is question on Council bill 119- 699 and with that, I turn it back over to you, Madam President.",5,,
77,0.97,1133.198,1138.07,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis and Karina, thank you for being with us this morning.",6,,
78,0.97,1138.07,1175.14,"I want to give you an opportunity from the Council perspective to give a quick preview of the Council bill being sponsored by Councilmember Lewis regarding civil emergency orders and for the benefit of those Council members who are not members of the governments and education education committee which I chair, if you could give us a quick little summary on the bill and what it will accomplish . Then, we will allow Council members to ask questions, if there are any.",6,,
79,0.97,1175.14,1175.507,Thank you.,7,,
80,0.97,1175.507,1201.767,"I'm on Council central staff and Councilmember Lewis provided a nice overview of the I will focus on that and right now, the only way for the city to enforce a violation of a civil emergency order is this criminal penalty, which is an outdated misdemeanor at this point of time in the law and hasn't been updated since the 1970s, as Councilmember Lewis noted.",7,,
81,0.97,1201.767,1213.845,The bill is both a cleanup of making sure those penalties reflect the current penalties--which are up to $1000 fine or 90 days imprisonment or both--and that is up to.,7,,
82,0.97,1213.845,1216.982,It doesn't have to be that extreme.,7,,
83,0.97,1216.982,1227.993,"It provides members of the public with ways to address violations with civil remedies and the city with an option for civil remedy, as well.",7,,
84,0.97,1227.993,1241.807,That means that members of the public can take Violators to court if they are injured in the city can use the civil infraction method as a more accessible and efficient way to enforce an order.,7,,
85,0.97,1241.807,1263.729,"A quick NOTE on this private right of action, building our Councilmember Lewis said about the private right of action, it would be filed against a person who violated the order and would not be filed against the city . A parallel example could be minimum wage.",7,,
86,0.97,1263.729,1272.704,The worker would sue the business.,7,,
87,0.97,1272.704,1282.147,And this legislation has the same language where the civil action would be against the person violating the order.,7,,
88,0.97,1282.147,1297.162,"Passing this bill will not change the types of enforcement actions for any existing emergency orders on its own and instead, the emergency orders would be needed to be updated in order to reflect these new options.",7,,
89,0.97,1297.162,1304.569,That would be future legislation or emergency order that would need to be transmitted by the Mayor or the Council in the form of a resolution.,7,,
90,0.97,1304.569,1324.756,Thank you for that additional information for that and would there be any questions about the bill related to the civil emergency for Karina?,8,,
91,0.97,1324.756,1324.956,Okay.,8,,
92,0.97,1324.956,1332.597,"Seeing none, I think it's crystal clear to folks that it did pass out of committee unanimously with the recommendation for the full Council to adopt it.",8,,
93,0.97,1332.597,1350.015,"We will work with the city clerk's office and indefinitely to hold resolutions 1966, effectively removing it from the full council agenda this afternoon.",8,,
94,0.97,1350.015,1355.22,"Appreciate the update on both of those aspects and thank you, Karina, for being with us.",8,,
95,0.97,1355.22,1360.225,You are welcome to Disconnect from the meeting and thanks for your hard work.,8,,
96,0.97,1360.225,1369.601,Any other questions or comments on the report from Councilmember Lewis?,8,,
97,0.97,1369.601,1370.635,"And hearing none, we will go down the roll call.",8,,
98,0.97,1370.635,1377.809,Councilmember Morales and then Councilmember Mosqueda.,8,,
99,0.97,1377.809,1385.15,"Council President, good morning and there are several items on the referral calendar.",9,,

101,0.97,1386.752,1405.937,"We've got several Commission appointments, as well as we will hear from the equitable development initiative director and from community members about establishing a permanent, equitable development Commission advisory board and I hope bring it to full council next week.",9,,
102,0.97,1405.937,1418.283,"Additionally, we have an ordinance to the Sodo Bia that will be referred to full Council and the ordinance POSTPONES the assessment update for 2021.",9,,

104,0.97,1425.19,1447.813,"Not from my Committee, but from my district, I do want to state my enthusiastic support for Constable 119-827 on the full council agenda this afternoon that allows for a legislative Rezone in an area of the Rayner Beach neighborhood and I think Councilmember Strauss for inviting me to attend the land use committee last week.",9,,
105,0.97,1447.813,1449.915,I'm sure he will talk about that later.,9,,
106,0.97,1449.915,1461.193,Last week I met with constituents that were eager for the city to find solutions to our homelessness crisis as the paper reported this morning with several fires in homeless Encampments.,9,,
107,0.97,1461.193,1500.765,"Meal programs have shot due to Covid and shelters are capacity and we know more people are living in tents and cooking fires are increasing . improving access to services and safe housing is a priority and I echo Councilmember Lewis' remarks about solving the homelessness crisis, especially in light of climate capacity adds another impact to these neighbors and we clearly are going to be dealing with some of this for a long time.",9,,
108,0.97,1500.765,1527.792,I met with constituents that want to ensure that we reach all of our black and Brown youth . There is an expressed need for additional resources for programs that serve young black and Brown women with opportunities for Mentrship and leadership and skill building and I look forward to learning about that and when we have conversations with Council President Gonzales about how we can support that in the near future.,9,,
109,0.97,1527.792,1547.112,I want to let folks know that the office of economic development is gearing up for the next round of small business stabilization grants and they are currently doing outreach to ensure language access before the application begins and that is slated to begin in October.,9,,
110,0.97,1547.112,1556.721,This is obviously really important work for the office of economic development and for small business communities as they deal with the impact of Covid and continue dealing with that.,9,,
111,0.97,1556.721,1566.998,"In order to get money out the door, the economic development will be shifting staff to assist with grant process and data collection and accounting and everything that will go with moving that money.",9,,
112,0.97,1566.998,1574.039,I would like to discuss with the community economic development committee how and whether we might want to hold out this initiative.,9,,
113,0.97,1574.039,1596.461,"It could be an important addition, ongoing addition to the work that Oed does but we have to talk about how to make it more sustainable . I'm still sort of in the gathering mode and will plan to have conversations about that starting soon.",9,,
114,0.97,1596.461,1608.94,"This week, I have a board of health meeting Thursday and we will be getting briefed on the Covid-19 impact of the community for mental health, suicide, domestic violence and community well-being.",9,,
