16,0.97,220.186,269.736,"There are so many public forward ways that the city clerk shows up every day and there are even more countless ways that a city clerk shows up behind the scenes to make sure our job is a lot easier including helping to facilitate these kinds of meetings, making sure we have all of the information we need to run efficient public meetings and we really appreciate all of the work that Monica Martinez Simmons, Emilio, Jody and so many others in the Council excuse me in the city clerk's office do every day to really make sure that our city government is functioning at its best.",3,,
17,0.97,269.736,295.495,"So thank you so much for allowing me the opportunity to make this presentation publicly, usually we would do this in chambers and have the benefit of seeing the faces of the folks who work in the office but unfortunately the times we are do not allow us to convene but I did want a moment to recognize the tremendous work that the city clerk's office does on behalf of us and beyond the people of Seattle.",3,,

23,0.97,340.606,343.242,I will echo my appreciation.,6,,
24,0.97,343.242,378.778,When I came back from my parental leave and was acting as President pro Tem for a few weeks I cannot thank the office enough for helping me navigate those early weeks back and they were on the front line as we came up for strategies with the Council President's office and other directors for how to respond and serve the public and protect the health of staff and Councilmembers during the time of Covid so they were extremely helpful under unprecedented times as always.,6,,
25,0.97,378.778,386.085,Thank you to them everyday for protecting public health and our health.,6,,
26,0.97,386.085,425.124,It should go without saying that many clerk staff are still showing up every day with their public facing job they are considered essential workers and we knowledge many of the front-line workers and a lot of other industries Besides government we often do not take the time to thank our own city of Seattle employees including those in the city clerk's office who are serving public facing functions like Chris in the reception area and folks on the third floor who are here every day ensuring to serve the public function.,7,,
27,0.97,425.124,438.538,So to our very own essential workers thank you for all the work that you do now and that you have done in the past and that you will do in the future we truly appreciate all the work that you do.,7,,

37,0.97,509.809,525.892,This is the third or fourth time we have done this but we are still finding improvements so I asked that everyone be patient as we learn to operate in real time and navigate through the growing pains and implementation of this tool moving forward.,7,,
38,0.97,525.892,537.637,We will look for ways to Fine- tune this process and any features that allow for additional means of public participation.,7,,
39,0.97,537.637,571.47,It remains the strong intent to have public comment included regularly the city council reserves the right to end or eliminate public comment periods if we believe the system is being abused or it's no longer suitable to be conducting the meeting efficiently . Today I will moderate the public comment period as a reminder to those who are on the line listening and to us on Council wanted to sort of give folks the reminder of how the public common group will be moderated.,7,,

46,0.97,644.043,662.561,Speaking of new tools we have been testing out this was tested out last week but there will be a new audible feature added to notify speakers that they have 10 seconds left in their allotted public comment time.,7,,
47,0.97,662.561,665.631,This is a 10 second notice to the Speaker to begin wrapping up their comment.,7,,

59,0.97,737.436,738.137,Thank you.,11,,
60,0.97,738.137,745.044,I am here to comment on Eviction legislation my husband and I rent two houses.,11,,
61,0.97,745.044,754.153,Current tenants have a mix of working-class and public service jobs and so far they have been able to pay their rent.,11,,
62,0.97,754.153,779.979,"We are ready to have conversations beyond that I am very concerned the extremes of Eviction and rent leave activism combined with the flurry of unprecedented landlord legislation like first in time are shifting the local markets to large corporate landlords who can better handle the increased risk and complexity of tenant relations, selection and now the Unsteadiness of rental contract.",11,,
63,0.97,779.979,795.794,"We need voices on city council who incorporate local small landlords for legislative action, we need a strong focus on Eviction prevention programs not lengthening legal contracts.",11,,
64,0.97,795.794,808.007,"If Seattle wants to be a city with locally owned rental houses Duplexes and other units city council needs to individually and collectively demonstrate that, today's legislation does not reflect that.",11,,

68,0.97,815.481,818.517,Hello.,13,,
69,0.97,818.517,827.726,Roger Valdes speaking on behalf of hundreds of housing providers across the city.,13,,
70,0.97,827.726,852.318,You have heard from over 400 of them that want to let the Covid- 19 ban expire housing providers like an 80-Year-Old woman who depends on income from her single rental unit to survive and housing providers like the one with hundreds of units with delinquency from people who are looking at layoffs in the months ahead.,13,,
71,0.97,852.318,870.369,"What you're planning to do with this proposal will have a lasting impact for people who need housing, housing providers provide a place for people to live, the income they earn covers cost of maintenance and improvements, residents or customers and often friends nobody wants to Evict residents.",13,,
72,0.97,870.369,873.639,This is an income problem.,13,,
73,0.97,873.639,877.876,For people who have lost their jobs and income need the benefits due to them.,13,,
74,0.97,877.876,898.797,"The Council should be working on that instead you are sending a signal to people in the city that paying rent is not important, you cannot solve a hunger problem by abolishing Shoplifting laws to encourage grocery stores who provide food access and income.",13,,
75,0.97,898.797,905.271,"What you're about to do will create Long-Lasting impact from delinquency, damage to housing and will discourage new housing in the future.",13,,
76,0.97,905.271,909.708,Thank you.,13,,
77,0.97,909.708,913.812,Thank you.,14,,
78,0.97,913.812,918.317,You may NOTE I am taking a pause giving I.T.,14,,
79,0.97,918.317,920.286,The opportunity to reset the Timer.,14,,
80,0.97,920.286,928.861,I apologize for the awkward pause . next Speaker is Dave.,14,,
81,0.97,928.861,939.038,Good afternoon my wife and I own a apartment building in Seattle.,15,,
82,0.97,939.038,984.083,"I am calling to follow-up with the Email I sent to all of you folks over the weekend with a couple comments on the bill, first referrals will not work, most residents which struggle to catch up on one month rent over five months that would be a 20% increase, catching up on six months over one year would be an I watering 50% increase and it is very hard to imagine a resident willingly continuing to pay Catch-Up rent after voluntarily or whatever reason moving out at the end of their lease.",15,,
83,0.97,984.083,990.856,I hate Evictions and Thankfully I have only had to do two during the 14 years we have owned the building.,15,,
84,0.97,990.856,996.895,"They are expensive, Time- consuming and relationship destroying.",15,,
85,0.97,996.895,1005.471,They are the absolute last resort but having said that an important tool for housing providers when all else fails.,15,,
86,0.97,1005.471,1008.607,Here is a way the city could mitigate housing providers losses.,15,,
87,0.97,1008.607,1023.122,That is to reimburse appropriately documented Covid- 19 hardship related forgiven not just deferred rent through property tax and utility fee credits.,15,,
88,0.97,1023.122,1034.9,This would be a win for all with the city providing material assistance both the housing providers and to residents.,15,,
89,0.97,1034.9,1044.443,"Any Covid-19 related ordinance should, in my view include an objective definitions of when the emergency is over.",15,,
90,0.97,1044.443,1047.446,And when regular rules apply.,15,,
91,0.97,1047.446,1058.857,Second as drafted 119784 excuses rent for payment for all regardless of the,15,,
92,0.97,1058.857,1065.764,"Thank you, the next Speaker is Dana Frank.",16,,
93,0.97,1065.764,1070.669,Thank you.,17,,
94,0.97,1070.669,1093.792,"My name is Dana Frank and I am a 55-year-old African-American woman and lifelong second- generation housing provider with 100 rental units, being a housing provider has always been my life work I have never held another job, in the 1950s my father and mother started investing in Seattle central district, I grew up with my sisters putting tickets on to funding.",17,,
95,0.97,1093.792,1111.743,My father has been gone almost 25 years and to this day I and my mother Theresa who was on the front page of the Seattle times persistence pays for black families investing in the central district get up every day to work full-time on rentals.,17,,
96,0.97,1111.743,1117.382,My mother is 88 and my son is 26.,17,,
97,0.97,1117.382,1139.905,"We are astounded that our efforts to fight red lighting and get funding are impact by a self-proclaimed strike and Eviction bands, we have been honored to provide quality housing for residents, we have great working relationships that have dealt with individuals affected by Covid on a case-by-case basis.",17,,
98,0.97,1139.905,1149.047,Our residents have legal obligations to pay rent so we have responsibility to provide housing.,17,,
99,0.97,1149.047,1164.463,"Central, Capitol Hill, Columbia city in central areas have been updated with elevators pulls, roof, Granite tops, laminate floors and amenities, due to increased crime we have added security cameras and more, if we are denied rent the properties will lack funding.",17,,
100,0.97,1164.463,1185.984,"Repairs will not be seen, the long-term effect of the ban and rent strike is we would be forced to sell to giant investment groups and would wipe out efforts and my ability to pass legacy to my children and their future.",17,,
101,0.97,1185.984,1189.688,"Residents affected need assistance from the government but we should not be penalized, thank you.",17,,
102,0.97,1189.688,1191.456,Thank you.,18,,
103,0.97,1191.456,1199.598,Next is Charlotte.,18,,
104,0.97,1199.598,1201.5,Can you hear me?,19,,
105,0.97,1201.5,1203.902,Yes we can.,20,,
106,0.97,1203.902,1219.718,"Okay I'm Charlotte this'll a small housing provider in the Columbia city neighborhood and I'm speaking to the proposal to extend the moratorium on Evictions, credit reporting and late fees.",21,,
107,0.97,1219.718,1227.025,I call myself a housing provider because the landlord rents land but housing provider does more.,21,,
108,0.97,1227.025,1232.13,"We provide housing with a roof, plumbing, heat, electricity and appliances.",21,,
109,0.97,1232.13,1244.71,"This past fall I put a new roof on the House I share with my tenants because it started leaking, that cost $10,000 which I did not have so I put it on my credit card.",21,,
110,0.97,1244.71,1251.65,"I have to pay the bill no matter what, my property tax went up so did my insurance, I will not get any exemption from any of these bills.",21,,
111,0.97,1251.65,1264.83,No one wants to Evict a tenant especially not one who lost their jobs because of unfortunate circumstances but Eviction and credit reporting are the only tools housing providers have to enforce rent collection.,21,,
112,0.97,1264.83,1276.174,If housing providers can neither Evict nor make credit reports will would prevent a person from living Rent-Free for six months or a year and then skipping out without paying their bill.,21,,
113,0.97,1276.174,1279.478,When the moratorium is lifted the answer is nothing.,21,,
114,0.97,1279.478,1292.257,This bill would create a loophole that could be exploited by dishonest people with no intention of paying their rent leaving housing providers on the hook for thousands of dollars.,21,,
115,0.97,1292.257,1298.964,I understand the perception that landlords have high profit margins and can afford to absorb this but it is not true.,21,,
116,0.97,1298.964,1305.27,Most small housing providers cannot afford it and would be forced to sell or go bankrupt.,21,,
117,0.97,1305.27,1306.104,That concludes my comments.,21,,
118,0.97,1306.104,1310.108,I want to thank the city clerk.,21,,
119,0.97,1310.108,1311.91,Thank you.,21,,
120,0.97,1311.91,1325.991,"Thank you Charlotte . Our next Speaker is, waiting for the Timer.",22,,
121,0.97,1325.991,1335.334,Next Speaker is Marilyn Yem.,22,,
122,0.97,1335.334,1343.642,I'm speaking against both counsel bills the proposal to extend the Eviction moratorium by six months.,23,,
123,0.97,1343.642,1357.956,"Being a small landlord this has forced us to take personal loans of thousands of dollars with no warning, no resources to cover with no guarantee of repayment, the care Zach did not provide relief for small landlords.",23,,
124,0.97,1357.956,1368.433,"Mortgages add up to over $100,000 a year for our rentals and that would be devastating for me and my husband to cover all on our own.",23,,
125,0.97,1368.433,1393.191,"If landlords cannot use Evictions to report nonpayment tenants will be significantly Incentivized not to pay rent, this legislation does not require a tenant actually be impacted by Covid-19 to use the moratorium, it is unfair to tenants to deprive them of assistance needed and encourage them to incur deep rental debt.",23,,
126,0.97,1393.191,1402.367,It is unfair to housing providers to prevent enforcement of payment plans and nonpayment for tenants who choose to not pay for housing.,23,,
127,0.97,1402.367,1411.343,This is telling people they don't have to pay rent even if they are able to and removing the disincentives that normally exist.,23,,
128,0.97,1411.343,1417.215,Some of you insist everyone who can pay rent will do so but then you have a Councilmember telling Renters who can pay rent they should not.,23,,
129,0.97,1417.215,1430.195,Evictions in King County below the national average is not an Eviction problem it is an income problem bigger than any individual landlord can solve.,23,,
130,0.97,1430.195,1444.609,Rental assistance is needed to give Renters the assurance they can pay bills allowing everyone to meet their obligation and it can be directed to the people who need it rather than granting a rent to broke Programmers you can make better laws than this.,23,,
131,0.97,1444.609,1446.344,Please vote no.,23,,
132,0.97,1446.344,1446.678,Thank you.,23,,
133,0.97,1446.678,1453.051,Next Speaker is Neil Wilson.,24,,
134,0.97,1453.051,1457.222,Hello my name is Neil Wilson.,25,,
135,0.97,1457.222,1463.228,I am speaking in relation to the Eviction moratorium.,25,,
136,0.97,1463.228,1479.344,I think the Council Eviction is--it's more about making big changes and even nationalizing housing.,25,,
137,0.97,1479.344,1486.685,Rhetorically I am asking why is the Council enacting legislation to support a rent strike?,25,,
138,0.97,1486.685,1495.594,The Council has used the multi family housing Council for information but it is important to use this correctly.,25,,
139,0.97,1495.594,1519.117,"Back in April on April 6 there was 30% of Renters that cannot pay rent but this has been continued to be used throughout the month, as of April 26 91.5% of Renters have paid all or a portion of the rent and that amount is only 4% below the same time period in 2019.",25,,
140,0.97,1519.117,1521.419,So there are a couple other statements.,25,,
141,0.97,1521.419,1534.799,Council feels it is important enough to include advisement by the housing Council in this current legislation.,25,,
142,0.97,1534.799,1550.649,"They also advised to do a 90 day postponement on Eviction, not nine months as effectively this would be if you start it from the day they made their statement in March.",25,,
143,0.97,1550.649,1566.665,"And really it is effectively going to be a one-year moratorium if this, the Mayor emergency declaration ends on June 15.",25,,
144,0.97,1566.665,1567.866,A couple other things.,25,,
145,0.97,1567.866,1571.97,"Okay I am done, thank you very much.",25,,
146,0.97,1571.97,1573.972,Thank you so much.,26,,
147,0.97,1573.972,1582.48,Next Speaker is Leslie Hoge.,26,,
148,0.97,1582.48,1591.056,I am Leslie Hoge from Fremont.,27,,
149,0.97,1591.056,1592.557,I want to start with the solution.,27,,
150,0.97,1592.557,1599.097,I think it is the job of government not private people to care for the vulnerable so all of us should be doing our fair share.,27,,
151,0.97,1599.097,1608.707,"Government should provide generous housing vouchers, food vouchers and medical vouchers for people in jeopardy of losing essentials.",27,,
152,0.97,1608.707,1612.377,This supports so Eviction will only be used in dire circumstances.,27,,
153,0.97,1612.377,1617.882,My husband and I are small-scale Mom-And-Pop housing providers.,27,,
154,0.97,1617.882,1625.49,Rent is so far below market that we operate on very thin margins and mortgage is only one small part of the expenses.,27,,
155,0.97,1625.49,1638.203,"We rent to artists and Self- employed people, people who look marginal when we rented them although in time we probably don't even have that option anymore.",27,,
156,0.97,1638.203,1662.961,"We are working with vulnerable residents now giving them discount, offering payment plans, whatever we can do to work together with them because we are all in this together but especially when they can afford to pay we will lose property and we will not be able to Evict a Nonpaying tenant, Thankfully we have never had to Evict anybody and I hope we never have to.",27,,
157,0.97,1662.961,1673.738,So if we lose our property the supply of affordable housing or what passes for it in the city will disappear.,27,,
158,0.97,1673.738,1689.988,"We are self-employed struggling like tenants and many others, we rely on rent to pay our bills like health insurance and groceries in addition to the maintenance, repair and the other expenses that go along with renting properties.",27,,
159,0.97,1689.988,1696.895,You are asking us to work for free and give up control of property with an Eviction ban and with rent forgiveness.,27,,
160,0.97,1696.895,1702.367,I am wondering if anybody in Council is working for free as well.,27,,
161,0.97,1702.367,1705.203,"Thank you for listening to me, goodbye.",27,,
162,0.97,1705.203,1707.806,Thank you so much.,28,,
163,0.97,1707.806,1712.911,Next Speaker is John wisdom.,28,,
164,0.97,1712.911,1714.979,Thank you.,29,,
165,0.97,1714.979,1730.595,I fully support the solutions providing direct support to tenants in need rather than the Evictions ban that would likely have sweeping negative consequences for small landlords and the supply of affordable rental housing in Seattle.,29,,
166,0.97,1730.595,1748.913,As retirees and small landlords my wife and I cannot afford to provide free housing without compensation any more than a small local family farm or corner grocery store could provide free food for hungry community without compensation to cover the cost.,29,,
167,0.97,1748.913,1766.564,The reality for anyone providing food or shelter is the fact that expenses have to be paid and those expenses many of the cost are required by regulation.,29,,
168,0.97,1766.564,1768.366,How do we maintain an apartment without rental income?,29,,
169,0.97,1768.366,1769.567,How do we pay property taxes?,29,,
170,0.97,1769.567,1787.485,"Rent is our basic income and we should not be forced to work without compensation as we need to be able to buy essentials for survival, a tenant may be obligated to pay but there is no assurance they will have the means to do so when the ban is over.",29,,
171,0.97,1787.485,1790.321,This proposal is too Far- reaching and will have unintended consequences.,29,,
172,0.97,1790.321,1795.727,Everyone will have license to stop paying rent without real consequence.,29,,
173,0.97,1795.727,1808.039,This means that a tenant who makes much more money than my wife and I can stop paying and inflict heavy financial and emotional consequences on the family.,29,,
174,0.97,1808.039,1810.008,Small landlords are forced out of business and who benefits?,29,,
175,0.97,1810.008,1816.281,Big corporations would deep pockets not the tenants who rely on us for housing.,29,,
176,0.97,1816.281,1820.585,Thank you for calling in today.,30,,
177,0.97,1820.585,1829.327,We are close to our 20 minute mark so I'm going to have to extend public comment if there is no objection.,30,,
178,0.97,1829.327,1844.542,I will also expedite the process and ask that the public comment number be set to one minute 32nd to allow us to go through the rest of the list.,30,,
179,0.97,1844.542,1861.826,We have about 12 speakers left that are present so I'm hoping that will be enough time to get through so I would like if there is no objection to extend public comment until 3:00 P.M.,30,,
180,0.97,1861.826,1867.332,It is currently 2:36.,30,,
181,0.97,1867.332,1871.369,We will go ahead and extend public comment until 3:00 P.M.,30,,
182,0.97,1871.369,1873.972,And then moving to items of business.,30,,
183,0.97,1873.972,1889.053,For those on the line we have reduced the time to one minute 30 seconds and I apologize to have to do that but we have several other speakers signed up and I want to make sure we have an opportunity to hear from everyone.,30,,
184,0.97,1889.053,1891.189,Next Speaker is Jennifer,30,,
185,0.97,1891.189,1901.799,Good afternoon city Councilmembers I am a housing provider and manage 12 residential units in queen and and Capitol Hill's.,31,,
186,0.97,1901.799,1908.306,I take pride in providing clean well trained maintain market housing.,31,,
187,0.97,1908.306,1917.015,I appreciate the passion and desire to help those who have suffered financially due to the pandemic however city council should not be calling for rent strike or Eviction moratorium.,31,,
188,0.97,1917.015,1937.802,"We assume all residents have suffered financial hardships but this is not the case, the Seattle times had an article documenting 10.6% of Washington residents are behind on April rent which means 89.4% are not behind on their rent.",31,,
189,0.97,1937.802,1949.948,"I find a similar percentage in the units I manage where 11 out of 12 residents or 91.7% have not suffered financial setback preventing them from paying rent, these residents pay the rent.",31,,
190,0.97,1949.948,1954.052,I work with my residents who need assistance to come up with solutions.,31,,
191,0.97,1954.052,1985.95,"Universally asking everyone not to pay rent and bending Evictions prevents having providers who truly need help and it hurts our city, the Seattle budget includes revenue from property taxes and utility bills paid by area housing providers, in addition housing providers hire businesses and treat people like electricians Lumbers and carpenters, less income is less spending, calling for rent strike and Eviction moratorium are not reasonable creating financial responsibility which no business can afford.",31,,
192,0.97,1985.95,1991.589,I urge you not to pass these and to provide timely assistance.,31,,
193,0.97,1991.589,1993.057,Thank you so much.,32,,
194,0.97,1993.057,2005.002,Next Speaker is Alexander . I'm sorry I will Butcher your last name.,32,,
195,0.97,2005.002,2014.779,Hello my name is Alexander and I am 26 and I just joined the family business.,33,,
196,0.97,2014.779,2040.204,We own an apartment building and since joining last year I have already seen the process for screening applicants become much more complex and expensive and we are spending more and more time running the risk of tenants and those types of how we are going to screen applicants when we are making development decisions.,33,,
197,0.97,2040.204,2063.861,"If the city continues to pursue this course of action, it's going to make it more difficult for us to support new developments in the future, if investors are wondering anytime in the future that the rent could possibly be put on hold it makes it difficult for them to be satisfied if they can make a long-term investment in Seattle.",33,,
198,0.97,2063.861,2071.669,The city needs to consider supporting individuals rather than asking for a ban and undermining lawful contracts.,33,,
199,0.97,2071.669,2076.474,We do not support the Council build.,33,,
200,0.97,2076.474,2078.776,Thank you.,33,,
201,0.97,2078.776,2080.778,Thank you.,34,,
202,0.97,2080.778,2087.485,Next Speaker is Edmund Witter.,34,,
203,0.97,2087.485,2097.261,"Hello my name is Edmund Witter and around the housing justice project, we could administer the Homebase program with United way.",35,,
204,0.97,2097.261,2123.855,"I am urging you to pass the ordinance 11 7984 along with her proposed amendment, the need for intervention, we have enough rental assistance available for struggling tenants but when we offered help for April we received within 48 hours over 7000 applications and I expect we will only help to thousand of the 7000 applicants.",35,,
205,0.97,2123.855,2138.503,We need to figure out a solution and we do need time to figure out how we can help tenant and the landlord's and this is one way to put a pause and make sure we help all the tenants who are struggling now.,35,,
206,0.97,2138.503,2163.06,"I understand the need for other relief that's available but at this point and time a system is necessary to put a pause, Congress did issue a 120 day moratorium but it does affect a lot of mortgages, this is providing additional relief for those as well so I urge you to pass this ordinance.",35,,
207,0.97,2163.06,2165.463,Thank you.,36,,
208,0.97,2165.463,2172.37,Our next Speaker is Rob right.,36,,
209,0.97,2172.37,2185.182,Hello everyone I live in district 4. first let me say thank you to the Council for your time and willingness to listen.,37,,
210,0.97,2185.182,2195.56,I am here to ask you to vote no on the proposal to extend the moratorium on rental Evictions.,37,,
211,0.97,2195.56,2212.643,"My wife and I own three small apartment buildings in Seattle, we purchased the first building six years ago as an investment in family future with the hopes of how the income can support paying our kids education and eventually retirement.",37,,
212,0.97,2212.643,2222.987,We are very middle-class and like many of you each month we are making sacrifices and are Prioritizing what to pay.,37,,
213,0.97,2222.987,2227.024,For monthly bills.,37,,
214,0.97,2227.024,2255.653,"I certainly fully support your efforts to provide assistance to Renters in need but my ask is that you help them by enacting programs to support them to pay their rent and other basic needs, taking away the rights for landlords to Evict will encourage some tenants to take advantage which simply is not fair to me as a property owner and it is not good for city long-term health.",37,,
215,0.97,2255.653,2269.066,I should also add that I have never evicted a tenant and I'm currently working with several tenants on payment plans with no intention to raise rent for the foreseeable future.,37,,
216,0.97,2269.066,2273.17,Please protect my property rights by voting no.,37,,
217,0.97,2273.17,2274.572,Thank you for being with us.,38,,
218,0.97,2274.572,2279.443,Next is Jessica.,38,,
219,0.97,2279.443,2307.004,"Hello Council my name is Jessica I am a lifelong Renter with 13 years renting in Seattle, eight years specifically in Wallingford and I have been a property manager for over seven years in market rate and subsidized apartments I am asking you to pass counsel bill 119874 but not to add Alex Peterson's amendments.",39,,
220,0.97,2307.004,2325.923,"The people who need the most protection during and after Covid are likely renting from smaller landlords, lower income tenants and those unable to met rental requirements are more likely to rent from smaller landlords these are service industry folks who rely on tips, tenants without predictable yearly income.",39,,
221,0.97,2325.923,2338.936,"Tenants who work night shifts, odd hours, Single-Parent families, families that have gone through divorce, parents in Nontraditional family structures.",39,,
222,0.97,2338.936,2351.549,"I am probably the first tenant you have heard from today, in addition I don't think someone who owns three buildings is a small landlord because as a Renter I own no buildings and they own three.",39,,
223,0.97,2351.549,2353.951,So that is something to take into account.,39,,
224,0.97,2353.951,2365.162,In a time of mass and employment and on we are struggling to keep up with these claims and to pay citizens as quickly as possible it seems the amendments are more punitive.,39,,
225,0.97,2365.162,2374.071,Thank you very much for your time this evening I don't know if you had a chance to read them but thank you for your time and your service.,39,,
226,0.97,2374.071,2377.975,Thank you so much for calling and.,40,,

230,0.97,2392.356,2396.46,Great.,43,,
231,0.97,2396.46,2400.898,Wanted to touch base with you to oppose counsel bill 119784.,43,,
232,0.97,2400.898,2412.309,Again my name is Candace and I work with a series of different apartment owners to help guide them through the process of owning their property.,43,,
233,0.97,2412.309,2441.138,"I have met with several Councilmembers regarding some of the most recent ordinances and I would just like to mention that I really talk to hundreds of these Mom-And-Pop owners and I can tell you when this Covid crisis began, not one landlord even thought about Eviction as even a remote first step.",43,,
234,0.97,2441.138,2449.647,The idea that that is the first idea in a housing provider's mind is really unfair.,43,,
235,0.97,2449.647,2476.674,"Right now if you're wondering what housing providers are doing, they're trying to figure out how to work with their tenants that are having trouble paying and balancing other expenses that they have to pay like property taxes which, although do June 1 will still be old at that time.",43,,
236,0.97,2476.674,2493.791,"Property owners are putting in, the property taxes on their credit card bills, they're trying to work with lenders to push back the mortgage requirements that they have to pay, it is not --",43,,
237,0.97,2493.791,2497.194,It you for being with us today.,44,,
238,0.97,2497.194,2500.397,Next Speaker is William.,44,,

240,0.97,2507.771,2513.677,My name is William I am asking the Council to vote against the extension of the Eviction ordinance.,45,,
241,0.97,2513.677,2521.318,My wife and myself on rental properties in Seattle and we only had one tenant that could not afford to pay their rent.,45,,
242,0.97,2521.318,2528.926,In April and they were provided assistance by the housing connect program.,45,,
243,0.97,2528.926,2560.157,"I would strongly suggest as an alternative to the ordinance that the city look at its housing levy funds and other funds to help support the housing connect program to provide rental assistance where needed, the Eviction been helps people of medium and high income people by the fact that if you are in less than $62,000 every year you're making more money because of the cares act additional insurance than you were before.",45,,
244,0.97,2560.157,2569.333,It has been well documented there are people voluntarily not paying their rent even though they can afford to.,45,,
245,0.97,2569.333,2579.643,What this does is encourages that action and as many of the Testimonies before me have said we are small landlord have our own bills.,45,,
246,0.97,2579.643,2589.653,"Property taxes, one rental property in the city of Seattle, it went up 101% in the last 10 years.",45,,
247,0.97,2589.653,2591.455,Inflation was 18.6% during that time.,45,,
248,0.97,2591.455,2593.49,Please vote no.,45,,
249,0.97,2593.49,2599.697,Next Speaker is Brett Frank.,46,,

251,0.97,2613.01,2626.957,Is a graduate from the University Washington school of business I took my schooling from Washington and by watching my family in the hard fight acquiring real estate the Council actions concerned me for my long-term ability to continue to provide quality affordable housing.,47,,
252,0.97,2626.957,2641.438,"We interact with residents who access their needs repairs and concerns, we have residents who have lived in buildings for 10, 20 or 30 years more as we take care of one of life's greatest needs.",47,,
253,0.97,2641.438,2654.251,We have a staff of employees 20 plus years and insurmountable numbers of contractors painters electricians and plumbers who depend on the rent to keep cycles going.,47,,
254,0.97,2654.251,2661.759,Giving residents an excuse not to pay especially for those who are able will create a habit and the Trickle-Down effect is easy to see.,47,,
255,0.97,2661.759,2671.869,"Providers will not be able to make mortgages and repairs, landlords will have to sell two big Conglomerates.",47,,
256,0.97,2671.869,2685.082,"In my life the landscape of Seattle has changed so much, I have served my friends and we believe we were not going to a restaurant and take food and not expect to pay or for that matter any service you offer.",47,,
257,0.97,2685.082,2694.291,"If you work you expect to get paid, a housing provider provides housing the same should be true do not give a signal that not paying is an option.",47,,
258,0.97,2694.291,2695.492,Please vote no.,47,,

278,0.97,2799.463,2842.339,"I don't know this Council understands the implications of the rent strike I would like to believe the Council is here to fairly lift all citizens but now it seems the Council is taking us versus them when we are all in need, I want you to stop undermining one group of citizens you are irrationally deciding can handle excessive financial burden, we own one small rental home that we bought from an elderly neighbor who did not want to see it torn down, we spent months fixing it up hoping to rent it out cost, there are part-time work and unemployment available to them, we are out of work and on unemployment ourselves.",55,,

281,0.97,2856.153,2866.663,"There is no profit being made only monthly loss on our part, tenants are hearing the call for a rent strike and are assuming landlords are getting resources to cover costs.",55,,
282,0.97,2866.663,2875.639,"They will start paying rent and this will eventually force people like us to self rental homes, do you want us to help or not?",55,,

287,0.97,2892.256,2895.559,Good afternoon.,57,,
288,0.97,2895.559,2900.564,This is Andrew grant Houston.,57,,
289,0.97,2900.564,2904.501,Speaking today as a small business owner.,57,,
290,0.97,2904.501,2916.68,I am someone who runs my own practice out of my home and it is a home that I rent from someone else and I'm speaking in support of 11 9784.,57,,
291,0.97,2916.68,2927.624,Because I am one of those many small business owners who is still waiting on funding and access from the Federal Government.,57,,
292,0.97,2927.624,2954.451,"Looking at this piece of legislation not just for myself but for other people in a similar situation where yes we would love to pay our rent if we are able to but we are still waiting to hear back from the Federal Government about things that we applied four months ago, I just heard back my application has been reviewed for economic injury disaster loans and I applied at the end of March and I just heard back today they are looking at application.",57,,
293,0.97,2954.451,2963.76,So in my mind the legislation is the limit of the capability of what you can do a city council members.,57,,
294,0.97,2963.76,2973.77,I know for myself what I am trying to do outside of this is hopefully get more work because I've had a lot of projects paused because of Covid.,57,,
295,0.97,2973.77,2987.584,"I want to ensure people can stay in their homes because unlike what was discussed so far, no one talked about the implications of people being out on the street and how that affects the spread of Covid.",57,,
296,0.97,2987.584,2991.188,I ask that you please pass this bill today.,57,,
297,0.97,2991.188,2991.588,Thank you.,57,,
298,0.97,2991.588,2997.861,Next up is mark Bronson.,58,,
299,0.97,2997.861,3008.605,Good afternoon my name is mark Bronson I am a longtime Renter of district 3 and I support the extension of emergency tenant protection under consideration.,59,,
300,0.97,3008.605,3016.012,I strongly oppose a proposed amendment that provides exemptions for tenant protections for small landlords.,59,,
301,0.97,3016.012,3060.123,"Due to severe housing shortages it is quite difficult and competitive to find an apartment in Seattle, Renters, those at the lower end of the income scale do not often have a choice on what type of landlord to rent from, anyone who has attempted to research the owners of a rental can tell you many rentals are massed by a web of LLC, there is no way for Renter to tell how many rentals that a landlord owns and if that information is available to the city, landlords should not have the ability to exploit loopholes regardless of how many units they own, please protect and expand protection for all Renters in Seattle, thank you for your time and I hope you all stay healthy.",59,,
302,0.97,3060.123,3061.558,Thank you for being with us.,60,,

305,0.97,3075.372,3083.079,Rha has a membership of over 5000 providers who pay less than $20 a month for resources for self managed are pretty.,61,,
306,0.97,3083.079,3093.69,Even before the orders on addiction our organization what is one of the first to put out business practices holding late fees and working with Renters.,61,,
307,0.97,3093.69,3101.565,We stand ready to work with Stakeholders and develop policies to address the financial crisis we cannot support this legislation.,61,,
308,0.97,3101.565,3114.11,This bill contains no nexus containing the prohibition of income due to the loss of Covid- 19 and it will nullify the filing of Eviction for payment of rent.,61,,
309,0.97,3114.11,3135.298,"Our office receives calls David from housing providers who are confused about if those who can pay their rent are required to under emergency executive orders, they read promotion of rent strike and cannot understand why individuals choose not to pay their rent even though they work normally through the crisis.",61,,
310,0.97,3135.298,3151.882,"We ask policymakers to look closely at the data that shows less than 10% of the rent payment shows up with the housing provider, those foregoing paying rent are not paying taxes, utilities, maintenance on the property and are hurting neighboring members who are struggling.",61,,
311,0.97,3151.882,3162.192,We continue to practice best practices and are helping to get all parties through this unprecedented period but we are not sure what will happen.,61,,

316,0.97,3178.542,3195.091,Hey Seattle city council I am a small landlord in the city of Seattle and I'm asking you to vote against this Eviction extension . I just kind of want to paint the scene for everybody.,63,,
317,0.97,3195.091,3205.168,People are calling landlords small landlords privileged and I don't think people are looking at the grand scale of things.,63,,
318,0.97,3205.168,3258.154,"Most of the buildings that landlords own they don't actually own, they are Mortgaged and you are talking to someone, say that I make $100,000 a year someone making 35,000 or 40,000 is calling me privileged but look at the millionaires and Billionaires that run the corporations and I know everybody has good intentions but this extension is really going to make it a lot harder for low income Seattle residents to find housing because the next time I have somebody who has a minimum wage job I will think three times about what my criteria will be because of the nightmare that I had trying to Evict somebody which now I cannot so I'm not saying I'm trying to Evict somebody but if that were to happen and I do work with my tenants and there's one that cannot afford to pay rent and they are on a payment plan but this encourages bad actors in my opinion.",63,,
319,0.97,3258.154,3261.825,Please vote against it.,63,,
320,0.97,3261.825,3264.661,Thank you for calling in today.,64,,

398,0.97,3933.529,3943.306,This is the first opportunity for the city to apply Federal appropriations and other locations to our city to respond to the Covid crisis.,88,,
399,0.97,3943.306,3955.051,"We appreciate the work the city budget office, office of housing and the Mayor's office has provided to us, they presented last week a full Powerpoint presentation about plans to distribute these funds.",88,,
400,0.97,3955.051,3964.26,I submitted a handful of Follow- up questions regarding the plan for sheltered and intensification and emergency homeless Covid response.,88,,
401,0.97,3964.26,3983.179,"We have subsequently at the end of last week heard a number of providers who are providing direct services to those who are most vulnerable in the community who are in need of housing, food services, cleaning, Ppe, staff pay for the folks working in homeless shelters.",88,,

403,0.97,4006.902,4023.519,"We are looking forward to having a robust conversation in the near-term about how the sources will be used for a comprehensive Holistic strategy that meets the needs of homeless services and providers, rental assistance, small businesses and more as we respond to the Covid crisis.",88,,
404,0.97,4023.519,4055.718,"We know we need to act quickly with these dollars that are enhanced, I appreciate ongoing conversation with the budget office to ensure we can get these dollars out the door as you can see in substitute version 7. this includes ongoing funding to make sure we are getting money out the door for small business stabilization, funding out the door for building stability fund we have increased some of the money going to that fund to $1.4 million.",88,,
405,0.97,4055.718,4067.83,We have split 1.4 million among homelessness prevention and rental assistance efforts and at this point we have added clarification in the amended bill in front of you.,88,,
406,0.97,4067.83,4076.172,We have clarified we would like food support front sheltered persons as an appropriate use of emergency service grant dollars.,88,,
407,0.97,4076.172,4103.099,We have added the desire to include mail delivery to permanent supportive housing as an appropriate use under the cares act Fund and we understand there is ongoing conversations about how the funds may be used and we believe ensuring mail delivery to those in permanent housing is appropriate and qualified use and we look forward to making sure folks get access to those meals.,88,,
408,0.97,4103.099,4130.593,Looking forward to having future conversation about the $1.4 million we are holding back in allocations in this round of cares act funding to allow for time for conversation with the executive office and homeless service providers pending that future conversation about what can be funded with existing funds from Hst or office of housing we will have more information to consider.,88,,
409,0.97,4130.593,4146.041,I mentioned a handful of issues that are needed among homeless services providers including the issues with support staff and Ppe and more so that is a conversation that has already begun.,88,,
410,0.97,4146.041,4169.665,We want to act quickly so my commitment to you is that we come back with an update on how those conversations are going and look forward to releasing the 1.4 million hopefully for additional appropriations to rental assistance as we heard today and we look forward to getting feedback from those services providers.,88,,
411,0.97,4169.665,4176.472,I am feeling confident about the ongoing conversations we have had with supporting residential and business tenants.,88,,
412,0.97,4176.472,4199.061,I appreciate the conversations you all have had participated in as we advance and protect tenants as small business tenants and as residential tenants and we are hoping that the conversation over the next week will truly add to a robust and comprehensive approach to protecting those experiencing the consequences of Covid.,88,,
413,0.97,4199.061,4220.583,I will NOTE this is an effort to make sure we are responding not just to the economic needs as we talk about building stability funds and small business stabilization funds we tried to work the tight rope to make sure we are continuing ongoing efforts to respond to the health crisis.,88,,
414,0.97,4220.583,4229.525,So that is sort of the impetus of the strategy in front of you with the bill that we have as amended.,88,,
415,0.97,4229.525,4262.424,"My office has spoken with the folks at United way rental assistance about the approach we are proposing in substitute version 7 and they have let us know they are holding, they have let us know holding a portion of the rental assistance fund temporarily will not cause negative impacts on folks assess rental assistance and they are concerned about the upcoming June 4 date when the moratorium expires and we have committed to working with them along with the entire Council to ensure funds are released prior to the date.",88,,

440,0.97,4352.214,4356.452,Are there any other further comments on the bill as amended?,109,,
441,0.97,4356.452,4367.062,I will just say again this is the first opportunity for us to accept Federal funds.,110,,
442,0.97,4367.062,4384.68,"I hope this sets the tone for the assistance we would like to see applied across the city in terms of rental assistance as well as families and individuals, workers for small business and as you will see in the next few days spurring additional conversations and investments in those who are most vulnerable and living in congregate shelters.",110,,
443,0.97,4384.68,4410.305,This morning we had a conversation about the desire to see the executive and departments move in their strategies and really diving into the recommendations that have come over in the last few days from the direct housing service providers and homeless shelters provider to make sure we are responding to the ongoing public health need in those settings.,110,,
444,0.97,4410.305,4418.614,We know that it is critical to not only participate in social distancing but we cannot keep distances when people are living in congregate shelters.,110,,
445,0.97,4418.614,4421.283,Very interested in following up with all of you.,110,,
446,0.97,4421.283,4433.629,I know Councilmember Herbold expressed interest to see movement on this effort in the next few days and we will be coming back very soon about the release of the 1.4 million.,110,,
447,0.97,4433.629,4440.302,"Thank you, are there any further comments on the bill as amended?",111,,
448,0.97,4440.302,4442.604,Councilmember Herbold.,111,,
449,0.97,4442.604,4456.752,First I want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for the language clarifying that seniors living in permanent supportive housing will be eligible to receive mail delivery funded by the Federal older Americans act.,112,,
450,0.97,4456.752,4473.268,Our friends at the housing development consortium conveyed a request to find ways to support mail provision for people in permanent supportive housing so I appreciate the substitute includes that language.,112,,
451,0.97,4473.268,4485.647,"As mentioned this morning, I have some reservations around reducing the amount of funds available for rental assistance.",112,,
452,0.97,4485.647,4496.391,Under normal budget times we find rent assistance programs to the tune of almost $4 million.,112,,
453,0.97,4496.391,4505.567,"We added an additional million dollars a couple weeks ago, we were poised to add another $1.5 million.",112,,
454,0.97,4505.567,4515.911,"We are reducing that to $750,000 but we really appreciate the understanding from Councilmember Mosqueda that this is a temporary pause.",112,,
455,0.97,4515.911,4534.83,I want to provide a little more detail about the conversations that my office have had with the Home-Based program and the United way more than 7000 households applied for April rent over a 48 hour period of time.,112,,
456,0.97,4534.83,4560.622,"The estimates are they will be able, with the current funding, they will be able to assist about 2000 of the 7000 households so the need for rent Assistnce is great and we understand that they will be doing another opportunity for people to apply for rent assistance on May 18.",112,,
457,0.97,4560.622,4581.176,"So I think a short delay on providing doubtful funding for rent assistance is acceptable and as Councilmember Mosqueda mentioned earlier, the United way and the Home-Based program is supportive of us doing so.",112,,
458,0.97,4581.176,4595.557,I'm comfortable with holding back some Federal funds for a limited period of time and I want to say I really support the goal of holding these funds back for a short period of time.,112,,
459,0.97,4595.557,4617.279,"If the goal is indeed to facilitate a conversation with the executive about how to ensure that people who are living in congregate care in unsafe and unhealthy conditions, that are able to move into places where they can stay safe and healthy.",112,,
460,0.97,4617.279,4624.987,We know that outbreaks of Covid- 19 among people in congregate shelters in the past several weeks is increasing greatly.,112,,
461,0.97,4624.987,4635.731,"Cases among people, that are expressing homelessness are accelerating as new cases in the county as a whole have stabilized.",112,,
462,0.97,4635.731,4644.039,2 to 3 weeks go people experiencing homelessness only comprised 1% of total cases where yesterday they are 40% of total cases.,112,,
463,0.97,4644.039,4656.251,So again I appreciate the opportunity to hit pause on the full allocation of these funds so we could deal comprehensively with the challenges before us.,112,,
464,0.97,4656.251,4660.155,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,113,,
465,0.97,4660.155,4668.563,Councilmember Strauss I am hearing a little bit of Ambient noise from your phone if you don't mind Muting that would be helpful.,113,,
466,0.97,4668.563,4670.866,Thank you.,113,,
467,0.97,4670.866,4674.77,My sincerest apologies.,114,,
468,0.97,4674.77,4677.839,That's okay we are all learning this together.,115,,
469,0.97,4677.839,4681.243,Are there any other comments on the bill as amended?,115,,
470,0.97,4681.243,4684.279,Councilmember Sawant?,115,,
471,0.97,4684.279,4688.784,Thank you President Gonzalez.,116,,
472,0.97,4688.784,4700.762,I will of course be supporting the bill and the attempt to figure out if funds can be allocated for the be Densification of the shelters.,116,,
473,0.97,4700.762,4713.909,"I think all of this discussion illustrates the no win situation created by local, state and Federal finances when big business does not pay their fair share.",116,,
474,0.97,4713.909,4771.733,I think unless government at all levels have political courage to create public revenue for Progressive sources we will end up as the recession gets deeper and worse and more widespread we will end up being forced to use not only this approach but ultimately we desperately need funding for the Home-Based rental assistance program and we also need funding to allow for social distancing within the homeless shelter system and both need to be passed and the only solution is to expand the public especially in a city like Seattle the most progressive tax system we will see budget revenues be deeply impacted as joblessness or working people keep going up because working people are Shouldering the burden so it's a matter of mathematics as well.,116,,
475,0.97,4771.733,4788.884,I think it was very important that the housing justice project administrator showed a Video to us that had received they have received 7000 applications for the Home-Based funds over 48 hours.,116,,
476,0.97,4788.884,4797.926,And the program can only help 1000 applicants and my conclusion might be slightly different from other Councilmembers.,116,,
477,0.97,4797.926,4890.085,"I think this shows with a joblessness dramatically going up and the number of applicants who need the funds rapidly rising, that in combination with Skyhigh rent and the amount of money that will be needed in terms of dollars, the sheer number of dollars that are needed to cover rent and people will not be able to pay rental assistance is not a viable solution, not a viable proposal by itself in the absence of taxes on big business and the wealthy of local state and local levels to generate the revenues to be used, the skill of rental assistance needed but equally important and more importantly rental assistance at this moment because in a recession somebody pays the price the only question is who will pay the price so rental assistance at this moment on a large scale on the basis of public funds would effectively mean a bailout for landlords and property management corporations given how Renters and tenants are exploited so in addition for all the rental assistant which I support we need to have a fight for full suspension without consequence of rent payments and mortgage and utility payments for Renters and homeowners and small landlords and the big banks, corporate landlords and Wall Street should pay for the crisis.",116,,
478,0.97,4890.085,4908.904,"I will share over 9000 Washington residents have signed the community petition for such a suspension without consequence of rent mortgage and we are seeing similar petitions and campaigns, hundreds all over the nation from other organizations.",116,,
479,0.97,4908.904,4913.008,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,117,,
480,0.97,4913.008,4919.314,And the other comments on the bill as amended?,117,,
481,0.97,4919.314,4935.53,Okay I do not see anyone else raising their hand or sending me messages from those on the phone so I will go ahead and close out debate and asked the clerk to please call the roll on the passage of the bill as amended.,117,,
482,0.97,4935.53,4967.228,Sawant aye Strauss aye Herbold Herbold aye Juarez aye Lewis aye Morales aye Mosqueda aye Pedersen aye President Gonzalez aye.,118,,
483,0.97,4967.228,4972.934,Item 9 favorite on the post.,118,,

485,0.97,4978.44,4983.278,Will look like please read item 3 into the record?,119,,
486,0.97,4983.278,4987.983,Agenda item 3 Council bill 119784.,120,,
487,0.97,4987.983,5010.071,Relating to termination of residential rental tendencies providing a defense to Evictions occurring within six months of the termination of the Mayor's residential Eviction moratorium as amended by resolution 31938 amending section 22.20 6.160 of the code declaring emergency and establishing immediate effective date.,120,,
488,0.97,5010.071,5013.575,Thank you so much.,121,,
489,0.97,5013.575,5021.716,I am going to move to pass Council bill 119784 is very second?,121,,
490,0.97,5021.716,5022.117,Second.,122,,
491,0.97,5022.117,5047.709,Moved and Seconded to pass the bill so we have several amendments to go through so my suggestion is that we go through the amendments first and then we can have a discussion about the bill as amended before we take a final vote on the bill.,123,,
492,0.97,5047.709,5052.747,So I will go ahead and kick off the conversation.,123,,
493,0.97,5052.747,5060.121,To make a motion to amend Council bill 119784 as presented on amendment one on the agenda.,123,,
494,0.97,5060.121,5060.922,Second.,124,,
495,0.97,5060.922,5071.633,"Moved and Seconded to amend the bill, colleagues as a sponsor of the amendment I will address first and then we can engage in conversation.",125,,
496,0.97,5071.633,5075.47,Amendment one is a very noncontroversial amendment.,125,,
497,0.97,5075.47,5101.696,It is a variation of technical changes so the amendments would make a grammatical correction referring to the date . It also adds additional compliance for governor order 20-28. I'm happy to entertain questions or comments about amendment one.,125,,
498,0.97,5101.696,5107.669,Hearing and seeing on I would ask the court please call the role on the adoption of amendment one.,125,,
499,0.97,5107.669,5155.884,"Sawant Sawant aye Strauss aye Herbold aye Juarez Juarez aye Lewis aye Morales aye Mosqueda aye Pedersen aye President Gonzalez aye . Nine in favor, none opposed.",126,,
500,0.97,5155.884,5158.82,The amendment is adopted.,127,,
501,0.97,5158.82,5166.528,I'm going to go ahead and call on Councilmember Pedersen who has amendment two.,127,,
502,0.97,5166.528,5171.633,Thank you Council President.,128,,
503,0.97,5171.633,5202.897,"The viewing public now might not know that we did talk about this, this morning during council meeting so bear with me as every piece some comments but to set the table for the three amendments that I have today I really appreciate the Council President working hard on this legislation, council bill 119784 I agree we need to do what we can as a city government to prevent Eviction.",128,,
504,0.97,5202.897,5209.203,I am proud to join my Council colleagues and the Mayor to support multiple relief packages and changing regulation's to provide relief.,128,,
505,0.97,5209.203,5215.31,This includes funneling millions of additional dollars to Eviction prevention and rental assistance.,128,,
506,0.97,5215.31,5221.115,I also want compassion of policies to be sustainable.,128,,
507,0.97,5221.115,5241.703,"Some constituents just like people who called in today, somewhere in favor, somewhere opposed and to reconcile these opposing views Ipo forward these amendments which I believe will be helpful for the Sustainability and the legislation.",128,,
508,0.97,5241.703,5251.646,I started by considering the approach we took to amend the legislation for moratorium on Evictions during the coldest winter months and then consider differences with the current Covid crisis.,128,,
509,0.97,5251.646,5265.059,The first amendment before us is to exempt small landlords defined as those with four or fewer units.,128,,
510,0.97,5265.059,5266.995,Do I need to move the amendment?,128,,
511,0.97,5266.995,5269.063,Yes you do before we discuss.,129,,
512,0.97,5269.063,5272.567,The magic words to put amendment two in front of us.,129,,
513,0.97,5272.567,5280.041,Moved to amend Council bill 119784 as presented on amendment two on this agenda.,130,,
514,0.97,5280.041,5282.343,Second.,131,,
515,0.97,5282.343,5290.652,"Moved and Seconded to amend the bill, Councilmember Pedersen you can now address amendment two.",132,,
516,0.97,5290.652,5301.195,Similar to the situation when we were considering the winter month ban on Evictions or moratorium on Evictions at that time.,133,,
517,0.97,5301.195,5327.755,"We heard from a lot of landlords on a couple of units, three units, four units, who are struggling to pay their mortgages, property taxes, property insurance and they are opposed to the bill, a lot of those that have written to us so this exemption would be in the same spirit of what we passed during the winter moratorium.",133,,
518,0.97,5327.755,5329.991,Happy to answer questions.,133,,
519,0.97,5329.991,5334.829,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,134,,
520,0.97,5334.829,5347.942,I would say in response to this that as I mentioned during Council briefing I am not supporting amendment two and I would like to talk a little bit more about why.,134,,
521,0.97,5347.942,5363.658,Over 50% of residents are tenants who live in small medium and large multi family buildings and many of them are feeling the negative impacts of the public health crisis causing an economic crisis of mass.,134,,
522,0.97,5363.658,5364.559,Proportions.,134,,
523,0.97,5364.559,5432.827,"That burden is being felt by low-wage workers who find themselves, many for the first time in their lives unemployed, many are Renters who would benefit from this law in particular so this amend and is proposed would strip many of the Renters of the ability to assert this defense if and when they need it in the six months after the Eviction moratorium declared by the Mayor is lifted, the intent of the bill is to provide access to an additional Eviction offense defense to as many tenants as possible regardless of if the tenant made a choice to rent from a corporate landlord or small landlord so Unfortunately I believe this creates too much of a Carveout that may result in living thousands of Renters without access to make opportunity to prevent Eviction in a court proceeding in the six months after the termination of the Eviction moratorium and for those reasons I will be voting no and I would ask my colleagues to join me in voting no on this amendment.",134,,
524,0.97,5432.827,5438.533,Just wanted to share those comments before I invite comment from my colleagues.,134,,
525,0.97,5438.533,5441.202,Anyone else want to make a comment?,134,,
526,0.97,5441.202,5449.644,"Councilmembers Sawant, Juarez and Lewis so Councilmember Sawant the floor is yours.",134,,
527,0.97,5449.644,5467.762,I will be opposing this amendment which would strip Renters of their Preventions against conviction especially in the context of a pandemic and a global recession that will be as deep or deeper than the great recession.,135,,
528,0.97,5467.762,5489.684,My office has been contacted by hundreds of Renters over the years and we have seen the big corporate landlord's are for more likely to be responsible for violating Renter rights but we have seen the worst landlords divide their properties up into multiple Llcs and have those owned by other Llcs and so on to obscure who owns what.,135,,
529,0.97,5489.684,5496.591,This provision makes it difficult for Renters to know if they are protected by the law.,135,,
530,0.97,5496.591,5522.817,"In the rare cases where the Eviction might be pursued by a smaller landlord Councilmembers and elected officials need to decide who most needs our support, families on the verge of being evicted losing everything especially in the context, many likely becoming homeless as a result, having damaged credit and having debt on their hands, possibly dying.",135,,
531,0.97,5522.817,5529.524,Are we going to stand up for them or somebody who owns four or 10 or 100 rental home?,135,,
532,0.97,5529.524,5535.596,Another important point who is a small landlord is a very subjective issue.,135,,
533,0.97,5535.596,5537.431,From their own admission.,135,,
534,0.97,5537.431,5571.565,"One of the two organizing town halls from April, we had a small landlord tell us who attended the town hall, they told us they had worked with their tenant who was laid off and they Proactively approached the tenant to negotiate an agreement that works for tenant and small landlord and I would urge all landlords to negotiate such agreements with tenants and be on the side of tenants not big property management corporations and landlords.",135,,
535,0.97,5571.565,5592.787,"Obviously Councilmember Pedersen is choosing to represent landlords and it is unfortunate the amendment was presented at the moratorium legislation that was put forward and it was unfortunate that some Council members voted yes, the amendment was bad then and it is bad it now for Renters.",135,,
536,0.97,5592.787,5621.716,"Councilmember Pedersen talks about reconciling between the interest of landlord and Renters, but as a member of the city of Seattle Renter Commission said in public comment today, as somebody who owns multiple buildings of apartments that is not the same as a working-class Renter barely getting by who is now statistically likely to lose their job with their income even if they have not lost their job.",135,,
537,0.97,5621.716,5625.82,I do not think we should make it easier to read the Working- class tenants.,135,,
538,0.97,5625.82,5639.6,We should learn from what happened in the wake of the 2007 -2008 recession were nearly 8 million middle-class homeowners were stripped of the only liquidity they ever had.,135,,
539,0.97,5639.6,5667.028,That will not be coming back anytime soon so we can see crises such as the great recession and the recession now unless we have a movement fighting back will be used not only to deny Renters and working-class people of their right during this pandemic but also to extract more from them and to extract them in different ways.,135,,
540,0.97,5667.028,5676.37,"Thank you Councilmember Sawant, I will call now on Councilmember Lewis and I think I have Herbold in the Queue.",136,,
541,0.97,5676.37,5684.879,I want to thank Councilmember Pedersen for bringing this forward and I appreciate the spirit in which it was introduced.,137,,
542,0.97,5684.879,5691.786,I supported a similar amendment during discussion of the winter Eviction legislation.,137,,
543,0.97,5691.786,5699.493,I think it made sense in the context of that policy in that we were moving into new territory.,137,,
544,0.97,5699.493,5708.069,It was a Proactive policy about clear policy preference and we were shipping the first in the nation ordinance to accomplish that policy goal.,137,,
545,0.97,5708.069,5735.296,"I think the circumstances are different for a lot of reasons articulated earlier by Councilmember Gonzalez namely that we have widespread and massive uncertainty over 1.4 million Washington residents are on unemployment, have lost their jobs, face significant insecurity above and beyond the precarious situation that a lot of folks were in before this.",137,,
546,0.97,5735.296,5747.241,Given that and given that policy goals are different here this is emergency legislation not to be in effect in Perpetuity but to be in effect for a brief period of time.,137,,
547,0.97,5747.241,5784.445,"Is designed to make sure that we have folks inside able to remain in place, to not be in a position where they are experiencing homelessness, to make sure they are in a position where they can be isolated for public health reasons to observe social distancing and other guidance that the government has applied and that the certainty and ability to do that will not be impacted by the uncertainty of an Eviction proceeding and we know that risk of displacement will persist after the orders are over.",137,,
548,0.97,5784.445,5792.987,We will not come out on the other side of this and all of the sudden be in a position Úwhere the economy will spring back.,137,,
549,0.97,5792.987,5825.019,Is going to be a long and difficult recovery so a buffer period between the end of the orders coming back I think would be appropriate . I think that exempting such a large number of units would undermine some of the public policy rationale of this emergency legislation so I will be voting against this amendment but I do appreciate the underlying rationale for bringing it forward but I think given the scope of the focus it is probably not the best approach.,137,,
550,0.97,5825.019,5829.49,"Thank you Councilmember Lewis, Councilmember Herbold.",138,,
551,0.97,5829.49,5832.393,Thank you so much.,139,,
552,0.97,5832.393,5848.642,"As a Councilmember who, in the winter Evictions legislation did vote for exemption for small landlords, I want to speak to the reason why I am not supporting that now.",139,,
553,0.97,5848.642,5868.729,"Has Councilmember Lewis just spoke, I think the policy and the reason for the policy that we are contemplating right now is very different in light of a health emergency and the impacts on the general public's health.",139,,
554,0.97,5868.729,5871.131,When people are homeless.,139,,
555,0.97,5871.131,5908.369,"Secondly, I want to just sort of, as a relates to my support of this amendment for the winter election or winter Eviction legislation, at that time I had Conflated the Seattle Department of construction and inspection rental housing registration program requirements as a relates to small landlords and large landlords.",139,,
556,0.97,5908.369,5919.113,The group holds information about the sizes of the number of units in buildings nobody holds the information about whether or not somebody is a large or small landlord.,139,,
557,0.97,5919.113,5950.344,"So I do not believe there would be a way for a tenant to be able to assert that there landlord was a large or small landlord in exercising this defense because it is not information that the city collects, the information that the city collects relates to the number of units in individual buildings for purposes of assessing an inspection fee so that is another reason to not support this amendment at this time.",139,,
558,0.97,5950.344,5954.848,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,140,,
559,0.97,5954.848,5956.984,Is there anyone else who would like to speak?,140,,

562,0.97,5963.757,5972.366,"My thoughts were summarized as well, Councilmember Pedersen I appreciate you bringing this amendment forward.",141,,
563,0.97,5972.366,5986.98,"I did vote for the amendment on the winter Eviction and because that is a permanent policy put in place and this policy is temporary in nature I will not be supporting the amendment, thank you.",141,,
564,0.97,5986.98,5988.782,Thank you so much.,142,,
565,0.97,5988.782,5996.457,Any other comments on this amendment?,142,,
566,0.97,5996.457,5999.159,Okay.,142,,
567,0.97,5999.159,6016.81,Councilmember Pedersen it is your amendment so I would like to give the sponsor of the amendment the last word so if you would like to give us some last words on your amendment before I call to vote please feel free to do so.,142,,
568,0.97,6016.81,6018.112,"Sure, I appreciate the process.",143,,
569,0.97,6018.112,6024.118,I'm glad that I brought it forward and I'm glad people were able to air their views on how they differ.,143,,
570,0.97,6024.118,6031.825,"I see the rationale and respect it, ready to call for a vote on the amendment.",143,,
571,0.97,6031.825,6077.838,"I want to echo the sentiments of some of my colleagues who appreciate what was potentially motivating your desire to want to bring amendment two forward, obviously we have a difference of opinion as to this particular amendment but I appreciate that we can engage in a respectful debate about those differences and ultimately move the policy forward still so thank you so much for reaching out to me personally and having that conversation about the fact that you were bringing forward this amendment and others and giving me an opportunity to have an off-line conversation with you about that.",144,,
572,0.97,6077.838,6081.842,At this point I will ask that the clerk please call the role on the adoption of amendment two.,144,,
573,0.97,6081.842,6086.88,Sawant no.,145,,
574,0.97,6086.88,6113.073,"Strauss, and no, Herbold, no, Juarez, no, Lewis, no, Morales, no Mosqueda, no, Pedersen, aye.",145,,
575,0.97,6113.073,6118.812,"President Gonzalez, no.",145,,
576,0.97,6118.812,6120.414,"One in favor, 80 post.",146,,
577,0.97,6120.414,6127.721,"Thank you, the motion fails and the amendment is not adopted.",147,,
578,0.97,6127.721,6144.605,"Council member Pedersen, I know you have another amendment for us to consider so I will hand it over to you to make a formal amendment for discussion on amendment three, excuse me, yes amendment three B.",147,,
579,0.97,6144.605,6164.725,"Yes, so this amendment is about either doing good faith efforts to show that the tenant has applied for rental assistance program or with more flexibility from the perspective of more flexibility they simply self certified.",148,,
580,0.97,6164.725,6183.777,I would like to move amendment three B and I know there is a proposed revision from Councilmember Herbold they can discuss in this but I would like to move amendment 3 B so we can discuss it.,148,,
581,0.97,6183.777,6184.111,Second.,149,,
582,0.97,6184.111,6198.392,"Moved and Seconded to amend the bill with version 3, excuse me amendment three B as described by Councilmember Peterson.",150,,
583,0.97,6198.392,6206.6,Councilmember Pedersen did you want Councilmember Herbold to make remarks before you make yours?,150,,
584,0.97,6206.6,6213.707,I would like to set the table 1ST and then I would welcome her revision discussion.,151,,
585,0.97,6213.707,6222.683,"Great, Councilmember Pedersen the floor is yours on amendment 3 B.",152,,
586,0.97,6222.683,6248.642,"This amendment 3 B would basically say that the tenant would have to show or say they have a good faith effort to obtain rental assistance from a public, private or nonprofit rental assistance program or they can submit a declaration or self certification stating that they have suffered financial hardship and therefore are unable to pay rent.",153,,
587,0.97,6248.642,6251.411,Let me explain how it got to this point.,153,,
588,0.97,6251.411,6264.524,"Again, looking at what we did during the winter Eviction moratorium when, which I ended up voting for, there were several amendments to that.",153,,
589,0.97,6264.524,6278.171,"At that time there was what we called a means test so we basically said those with no income, low income or moderate income were eligible for that in the winter Eviction ban.",153,,
590,0.97,6278.171,6296.79,"However, a means test today may not make sense and somebody was earning 80% of their income in 2019 for their tax return they may not be now because of the Covid emergency.",153,,
591,0.97,6296.79,6299.126,So the means test was not practical right now.,153,,
592,0.97,6299.126,6320.58,"And then the idea was to link it to Covid, a hardship that is incurred however, the direct link to Covid in terms of the tenant stating they had a hardship due to Covid was removed what the substitute version.",153,,
593,0.97,6320.58,6329.923,"So that is how, without that I was looking for a way for the tenant, the whole idea is to prevent the Eviction.",153,,
594,0.97,6329.923,6345.739,"So the idea is to have them seek the financial assistance and rental assistance, all these programs we have been talking about that are available and to simply state that there was a good faith effort to make that rental assistance.",153,,
595,0.97,6345.739,6375.869,"In conversations with some folks including Council President who pointed out not everybody is eligible for the programs, there are barriers for certain folks, then it came down to saying that or simply self certifying there is financial hardship so that's how the amendment has evolved and I think there is further evolution here about to take place with Councilmember Herbold and the proposed revision.",153,,
596,0.97,6375.869,6380.54,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,154,,
597,0.97,6380.54,6392.486,I did want to reiterate that this morning I indicated that I might be willing to support a self certification declaration path.,154,,
598,0.97,6392.486,6441.101,"Initially I thought you were intending to revise your amendment in such a fashion that you would Bifurcate the amendment to in good faith access rental assistance from the sort of new option to provide a declaration of financial hardship for the inability to pay rent and so when I saw the revised amendment that happened to those two things coupled, innocent put them in the same amendment and led me to the conclusion I cannot support it because it is still included in the language around the need to access rental assistance as one of the ways, through financial hardship to approve.",154,,
599,0.97,6441.101,6477.504,"So I know that there has been conversation from this afternoon about a potential decision and revision to your proposal that might create an amendment that would be more palatable to me, which would be one that allows for decoration and self certification but not required a sort of exhaustion of administrative remedy to go through the process of showing that you tried to access rental assistance.",154,,
600,0.97,6477.504,6509.202,So again I appreciate the intent that you have here to create some sort of requirement on behalf of the tenant to give assurances that they are in fact experiencing financial burden and I'm going to sort of leave it at that and open it up for additional comments and see if perhaps Councilmember Herbold wants to speak up at this point.,154,,
601,0.97,6509.202,6513.573,You are on mute.,154,,
602,0.97,6513.573,6516.776,Are you inviting my amendment Council President?,155,,
603,0.97,6516.776,6519.679,Yes.,156,,
604,0.97,6519.679,6523.316,It sounds like we are.,157,,
605,0.97,6523.316,6548.141,"Fantastic, I moved to amend version 2 of amendment 3 B, this is the version noted as version 3, perhaps before I read what the content of the amendment is should be checked to see if there are any objections to waiving the rules for this amendment as well?",158,,
606,0.97,6548.141,6550.944,Yeah.,159,,
607,0.97,6550.944,6562.322,So I know that Councilmember Herbold you have this proposed Aendment to the amendment so in order for us to consider this amendment Council rules will need to be suspended.,159,,
608,0.97,6562.322,6570.463,If there is no objection Council rules related will be suspended.,159,,
609,0.97,6570.463,6583.643,"So hearing no objection, the rules are suspended and now Councilmember Herbold you are free to move your amendment that would amend Councilmember Pedersen amendment 3 B.",159,,
610,0.97,6583.643,6592.786,"I moved to amend version 2 of amendment 3 B, the version Referenced as version 3.",160,,
611,0.97,6592.786,6605.498,Amending the last subsection 2 deleting the words has applied for or made a Good-Faith effort to obtain rental assistance from a public private or nonprofit rental assistance program.,160,,
612,0.97,6605.498,6621.181,If adopted this section 2 would still include a declaration or sub certification asserting that the attendant has severed financial hardship and is therefore unable to pay rent.,160,,
613,0.97,6621.181,6623.817,Second.,161,,
614,0.97,6623.817,6634.828,"Moved and Seconded to amend amendment 3 B, Councilmember Herbold would you like to speak more to your amendment?",162,,
615,0.97,6634.828,6640.634,"Thank you, I appreciate Councilmember Pedersen bringing both versions of these amendments forward.",163,,
616,0.97,6640.634,6655.448,My intent in the amendment to that most recent version 3 B is really just to streamline what it is that we expect a judge to take a look at.,163,,
617,0.97,6655.448,6667.26,And confirm . The certification being signed is something that a judge can review.,163,,
618,0.97,6667.26,6673.166,And deception in such a certification is considered perjury.,163,,
619,0.97,6673.166,6706.299,"Whereas the determination of whether or not somebody has made a Good-Faith effort to obtain rental assistance, Interjects a certain amount of complexity to a judges decision in this area and again this is intended to release streamline and lift the burdens on the court for making these determinations.",163,,
620,0.97,6706.299,6712.005,"Thank you Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Pedersen.",164,,
621,0.97,6712.005,6723.216,"Thank you, I welcome this as a friendly amend and appreciate how this has evolved by the conversations.",165,,
622,0.97,6723.216,6755.415,"I just wanted to clarify my intent, is that it would be good faith efforts to deem rental assistance or to submit or provide the Declaration so the tenant could do either one of those, so there were a couple different paths for them but I understand the Trepidation of some appearance of adding a barrier which I do not want to do so I just wanted to clarify that",165,,
623,0.97,6755.415,6758.051,Thank you for that clarification.,166,,
624,0.97,6758.051,6767.56,"I really appreciate Councilmember Herbold, your partnership in advancing this amendment to amendment 3B.",166,,
625,0.97,6767.56,6796.456,"I think it is a good fix, it does streamline things and while I appreciate Councilmember Pedersen your original amendment included the word or, it still made me nervous as to how that would be applied in practice by a judge or how it would be utilized by landlords in Eviction proceedings.",166,,
626,0.97,6796.456,6823.683,"So I think this is a much cleaner approach, certainly one of the things they could put into their self certification or decoration is a representation they try to access rental assistance and were not able to secure it, so I think this is an elegant solution to the, the underlying issue that you are trying to resolve Councilmember Pedersen to your original amendment.",166,,
627,0.97,6823.683,6837.096,"For the benefit of my colleagues, we had a conversation with the King County bar Association housing justice project lawyer who we heard in public testimony earlier.",166,,
628,0.97,6837.096,6877.871,He indicated in terms of on the ground perspective having experienced representing tenants in these court proceedings that they believe this is a good solution and would not present any additional barriers to access the Eviction defense and has confidence that a judge would see a decoration signed under the penalty of perjury as acceptable evidence to be able to support making a case if this defense is asserted in Eviction proceedings.,166,,
629,0.97,6877.871,6889.983,I took him to go with the representation,166,,
630,0.97,6895.355,6896.356,Councilmember Sawant?,167,,
631,0.97,6896.356,6997.39,"Thank you, I think that Councilmember her worlds version I will still be voting no on this amendment, I find it disturbing that Councilmembers are evoking this idea that this Bogeyman of a bad tenant that's when you skip out on rent, I'm not saying it doesn't happen, maybe it does, but the point is, policymaking has to be based on statistical evidence, and it overwhelmingly, not just mostly, Evictions, absolutely targeting the most vulnerable in our society, the report showed that black community members, especially black women and single households, the ones that are most targeted, based on that evidence and the fact that vast majorities of working people are going to have job losses in income losses, or suffering, the only impact of this amendment is to force people who are already losing everything, as I said, it is still a pointless indignity, already in dire financial Straits.",168,,
632,0.97,6997.39,7015.375,"Other than being odious towards working people who are already facing the recession, I don't know why this Good-Faith effort burden is not being put that on landlords, for those reasons I will be voting no on this amendment.",168,,
633,0.97,7015.375,7016.275,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,169,,
634,0.97,7016.275,7020.58,Any other colleagues want to make any comments?,169,,

636,0.97,7021.08,7029.188,"Just clarifying, we are about to vote on the amendment to Councilmember Pedersen's amendment?",170,,
637,0.97,7029.188,7032.525,That is correct.,171,,
638,0.97,7032.525,7040.833,Any other questions or comments for my colleagues?,171,,
639,0.97,7040.833,7042.969,"Okay, so",171,,
640,0.97,7042.969,7050.209,"Sorry, is a process point, have we voted on the amendment to the amendment?",172,,
641,0.97,7050.209,7054.313,I believe we just put it on the motion.,172,,
642,0.97,7054.313,7057.25,Maybe I am wrong.,172,,
643,0.97,7057.25,7082.575,"No, we have moved and Seconded to consider Councilmember Herbold's amendment to amendment 3B, we are going to vote on the amendment to Councilmember Pedersen's amendment, but we haven't voted yet on Councilmember Pedersen's version, the version next as amended.",173,,
644,0.97,7082.575,7083.509,Parliamentary procedure is the best.,173,,
645,0.97,7083.509,7100.393,"[Laughter] all right folks, Okay, and the other comments on the amendment as proposed by Councilmember Herbold?",173,,
