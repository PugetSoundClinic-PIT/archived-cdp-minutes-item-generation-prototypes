74,0.97,409.008,425.892,"Just to remind you, the strategic investment fund was first established in the 2020 adopted budget, remembering it was based on the anticipated sale from properties.",25,,
75,0.97,425.892,438.671,The 2021 proposed budget was proposed to Council last year and the money was not included in the budget but was reallocated to other priorities.,25,,
76,0.97,438.671,466.032,"The Council wanted to hold to the original promise of 2020 to add back in the $30 million for the strategic investment Fund and the executive went forward with implementing that proposal as the Council had intended . I think they will do a good job talking about the process they went through, which was an excellent one .

82,0.97,501.667,527.393,"This is also a huge milestone for us and a large process and years of advocacy from organizations that have worked very hard over the years to make sure we make good on our promises and when there is a public piece of land, if if there is the opportunity for us to use that for the public good, we should.",28,,
83,0.97,527.393,533.699,That sale went through and communities said we want to have a public benefit from this as well.,28,,
84,0.97,533.699,546.579,"Having these dollars going toward making sure we are investing in communities, especially communities that are hardest hit by displacement was an important component of the sale.",28,,
85,0.97,546.579,579.245,"We also have been working to make sure that we are creating more opportunities to hold the public hand as a result of the sale in 2018 in 2019 when the city was negotiating, we heard from advocates that we should be holding on to public land instead of selling it to the highest bidder and we should be making the request for those public lands to be shared among the community . excuse me, among the city to make sure we can develop things like housing.",28,,
86,0.97,579.245,592.258,"If the city doesn't want to use it and we don't have the need for the surplus land, we should be Prioritizing it for communities who are interested in building affordable housing and community assets.",28,,

91,0.97,639.372,652.818,Consul President Gonzalez and I had advocated for there to be more public benefits like Childcare centers with the Footprint . We use more of those proceeds for things like investments we will talk about today.,28,,
92,0.97,652.818,662.928,In 2019 in addition to the allocation the council passed a provision requiring $30 million.,28,,
93,0.97,662.928,677.943,There is truly community driven strategic acquisition being developed as a result of these funds . I am excited to hear more about the projects you selected.,28,,

105,0.97,778.244,828.06,"Again, this has originated from the sale of publicly owned property and communities in place . again, council funded this in the 2021 budget . I want to start by saying discriminatory practices in public and private investments have significantly impacted black and indigenous communities as well as queer and Trans and Bipoc communities.",29,,
106,0.97,828.06,839.405,"The Office of housing, office of Agriculture, the Department of neighborhoods and central staff.",29,,

110,0.97,880.212,890.189,The proposals do not need to include one of these community benefits.,29,,
111,0.97,890.189,896.862,Also it included existing funding for community development.,29,,
112,0.97,896.862,900.966,Next?,29,,
113,0.97,900.966,909.675,It was released in early June and was open for six weeks.,29,,

117,0.97,939.805,941.874,In the criteria that I mentioned earlier.,29,,
118,0.97,941.874,944.209,Next?,29,,
119,0.97,944.209,960.092,Through this fund the community advisory group considered proposals for real estate whether it is a vacant property or buying a portion of Upfront affordable housing.,29,,
120,0.97,960.092,967.833,We cut the funding to $5 million.,29,,

122,0.97,969.802,979.011,"The funds could be used for existing acquisitions or acquire a property in its entirety, as you have been hearing.",29,,
123,0.97,979.011,981.847,Next?,29,,
124,0.97,981.847,991.957,I just want to Revisit this map and say that the strategic investment fund proposal finds highly displaced neighborhoods.,29,,
125,0.97,991.957,1017.583,Left areas in the Red on the map or areas in Brown on the right with proximity to significant land or investment . We were intentional to not define these because we do not want to exploit important projects because of how the city defines these Geographies.,29,,
126,0.97,1017.583,1024.089,They told us how their proposed sites met our geographic goals.,29,,
127,0.97,1024.089,1027.292,Next?,29,,
128,0.97,1027.292,1028.961,Who applied?,29,,
129,0.97,1028.961,1057.589,"Commercial and residential tenants at risk of displacement, people in the Bipoc community . for example, locally owned small business in an older commercial building learned about the building that may be going up for sale.",29,,
130,0.97,1057.589,1076.909,They end up reaching out to a nonprofit real estate group or nonprofit authority that is mission driven to support their desire to control their own real estate and together they begin a partnership but still they have a significant gap between their resources and appraised value of the building.,29,,
131,0.97,1076.909,1108.74,"We can't share the project examples or groups that ended up coming together and applying for the strategic investment fund . I also really want to hand it over to Julia from slide number nine and just recognize her leadership and brilliance in this project . Yeah, I will have her take it from here.",29,,
132,0.97,1108.74,1159.525,"Thanks . So we talked a little bit about the community advisory group who was represented, but to give you a different sense of all of the different groups we had Community-Based organizations, equitable development practitioners, Philanthropy Funders and made sure to have representation from the equitable communities by equitable development initiative, task force, and space agency with the office of culture so we have strong ties across all of the efforts of the city to address displacement and through projects in land acquisition.",30,,
133,0.97,1159.525,1192.457,"This diagram represents the process that we went through here on July 14th we received 100 applications totaling over $330 million in asks . It is indicative of the demand and the need for these types of resources for Community-Based organizations, tenants, small businesses to be able to secure property, to secure their communities.",30,,
134,0.97,1192.457,1212.945,"Once we received that application, we advanced all of them to the community advisory group who then signed conflict of interest and Nondisclosure agreements . for the first round of review, we split the community advisory group into four groups to manage conflicts and assign reasonable reading lists.",30,,
135,0.97,1212.945,1225.791,Each group reviewed 25 applications and advanced 5 to the next round . Then everybody read the remaining observations.,30,,
136,0.97,1225.791,1240.005,We had a consensus process to identify the $30 million . I think it is important to note that all of the applications that were advanced from the first day to the second day were extremely qualified.,30,,
137,0.97,1240.005,1248.38,If we had an additional $50 million we would have funded all of them.,30,,
138,0.97,1248.38,1290.355,"It was a very hard process . to give you a sense of where the conversation, you know, the focus of the conversation, this is our evaluation criteria rubric that we published in our guidance documents . It set along the Rfp on the Website so we could have transparency on what comprised an excellent application that would have a high likelihood of getting funding and what might be a more lower scoring application that might not be funded.",30,,
139,0.97,1290.355,1306.838,Some of the language we ended up focusing a lot of the conversation on that these were Transformational once in a generation opportunities for asset and wealth building . They had a systemic community impact.,30,,
140,0.97,1306.838,1319.451,"Factored in capacity building, so we were not just funding projects but we were able to fund projects that were still in the envisioning stage.",30,,
141,0.97,1319.451,1360.225,"That had an impact beyond this one project and amplifying systemic resources financial and nonfinancial . the community advisory group recommended awarding funds to 13 projects across the city, like central central area representing Black- led organizations, indigenous led organizations or Multiracial Bipoc community organizations.",30,,
142,0.97,1360.225,1376.441,"It includes affordable housing for families and seniors, Childcare, cultural space, preservation and creation, community space preservation, open space, and historic preservation.",30,,
143,0.97,1376.441,1397.028,"And just a note for this group because I'm sure you will have burning questions about who the Awardees are, it is considered sensitive real estate information that we will be discussing with the full Council for September 20th.",30,,
144,0.97,1397.028,1398.93,Will be able to see the full list.,30,,
145,0.97,1398.93,1455.52,"We have not published any of the details in order to protect some of the sensitive real estate and ongoing real estate transactions . The reason we are here today is to discuss the legislation and as mentioned in the 2021 adopted budget, the Council appropriated the funds with a proviso pending a spending plan from the executive and the legislation denotes the spending plan is moving the $30 million allocated from two Finance generals to the office of community development . There is further detail about we discuss about who is designated through the Rfp process and decision making.",30,,
146,0.97,1455.52,1474.539,"Once the proviso is lifted, we will be contacting Awardees . As I mentioned, Awardees will have to announce publicly that we will be able to announce the individual awards once the transaction is finalized.",30,,
147,0.97,1474.539,1484.516,And that's the end . I would love to hear any questions or comments.,30,,
148,0.97,1484.516,1491.923,I am not seeing any hands up . I just wanted to say thank you again for this work.,31,,
149,0.97,1491.923,1514.179,"Colleagues, as a reminder we will have another committee discussion and next vote Friday, September 17th as noted by Giuilia . We will hear more about those confidential matters and with a hopeful vote on September 27th so that we can get this out of our hands by the end of the month.",31,,
150,0.97,1514.179,1524.589,"Thank you very much for providing this overview . are there any additional questions, colleagues?",31,,
151,0.97,1524.589,1544.676,"I would love to know more about the role that you two will continue to help with some of these contracts, given the relationships that you have and your detailed understanding of the Awardees . could you talk more about the ongoing work you might be able to do as it relates to these recipients?",31,,
152,0.97,1544.676,1559.324,Yes . both of us and actually the team will be project assistance on a regular basis.,32,,
153,0.97,1559.324,1583.248,"Some of the folks will also have the Edi capacity building funds . We will be closely working with these groups to bring them together so they can learn from each other and to continue with the regular, you know, technical assistance of project management that we have been doing with other projects.",32,,
154,0.97,1583.248,1589.054,Excellent . Thank you.,33,,
155,0.97,1589.054,1597.228,I remember asking about this when the criteria was developed.,34,,
156,0.97,1597.228,1616.047,I don't know how it was resolved . It looks like the geographic criteria allows for projects that are either in areas of high displacement risk or low axis opportunity.,34,,
157,0.97,1616.047,1626.091,It does not require both criteria be in place.,34,,
158,0.97,1626.091,1676.941,"In my recollection, Oh Pcd in the past in some Land-Use decisions have sort of Melded two maps and overlaid areas of high displacement risk in those neighborhoods that meet both criteria . for instance, not receive a large one because of the concern that a large MH age bump would have an impact on the residents of the folks who live in high displacement risk areas that also have low axis opportunity is.",34,,
159,0.97,1676.941,1683.114,Can you confirm that it is just one criteria that needs to be in place?,34,,
160,0.97,1683.114,1699.03,And what is the thinking of not requiring both criteria and sort of having that overlay and identifying those areas that share both triggers?,34,,
161,0.97,1699.03,1702.867,That is a great question.,35,,
162,0.97,1702.867,1725.657,"I think your understanding is correct . We do not require an ""and ."" there was a caveat that there was a displacement risk to the community that was applying . does that make sense?",35,,
163,0.97,1725.657,1733.364,The immediate displacement risk was a criteria that the committee evaluated on.,35,,
164,0.97,1733.364,1770.335,"I think we mentioned before that we know the maps don't reflect the full nuance of what displacement looks like in our city . We were very clear in our One-On-One meetings . If you are a community at high risk of displacement, you are a community center small business feeling the pressure of rent increases, you should apply and tell us how you are being impacted by displacement.",35,,
165,0.97,1770.335,1782.247,We Receved a handful of applications that did not fit within the Hotspots and map . We can talk through some of those in the executive session.,35,,
166,0.97,1782.247,1784.549,That is super helpful.,36,,
167,0.97,1784.549,1789.42,"I really, really appreciate that . Thank you.",36,,
168,0.97,1789.42,1821.586,"It was probably three or four neighborhoods . You know, areas like Chinatown are high risk displacement . The reason they show up as displaced is because the communities there that typically benefit from these types of investments don't have access to their jobs or high-risk displacement or things like that.",37,,
169,0.97,1821.586,1829.194,That is why we ended up with the and/or.,37,,
170,0.97,1829.194,1831.296,Thank you.,38,,
171,0.97,1831.296,1835.366,I really appreciate it.,38,,
172,0.97,1835.366,1838.803,"Thank you for your answers, all of the work you have done.",39,,
173,0.97,1838.803,1840.805,Will be see you again next week?,39,,
174,0.97,1840.805,1857.121,"Okay, great . We will see you at the next committee meeting and if there are any questions, just NOTE the team will be back next Friday to be there for discussion and possible vote.",39,,
175,0.97,1857.121,1862.026,Thanks for all of your work and congratulations to the community members to be announced at some point in the near future.,39,,
176,0.97,1862.026,1870.301,I'm sure we will look forward to working with you on identifying additional strategies to fund those that did not get into the final round.,39,,
177,0.97,1870.301,1894.259,I can only imagine how heartbreaking it is to read the proposals and not have the funds available . I will Jumpstart with some of the other investments we have coming through equitable development initiative from the office of housing.,39,,
178,0.97,1894.259,1898.563,"Along with the local development initiative, I am hopeful we will continue to see more opportunities for funding in the future.",39,,
179,0.97,1898.563,1899.764,Thank you very much.,39,,
180,0.97,1899.764,1902.367,Thank you.,40,,
181,0.97,1902.367,1903.468,Thank you.,41,,
182,0.97,1903.468,1914.779,"Madam clerk, let's move on to items two and three . If you could read those both into the record at the same time, that would be great.",42,,
183,0.97,1914.779,1948.112,"Council bill 120156, an ordinance relating to the multifamily housing property tax exemption program . item number three, resolution 32017, a resolution calling for research, engagement, and presentation of the information to the Mayor and city council on the multifamily tax exemption program prior to considering the renewal of the program in 2023 for briefing, discussion, and possible vote.",43,,
184,0.97,1948.112,1963.795,"Thank you, Madam clerk and thank you to the office of housing . I know you have been on our agenda for the last two or three times and Unfortunately we have had to reschedule a few of those meetings, but we are here today for final passage on these two items.",44,,
185,0.97,1963.795,1970.601,We have two hours for it! I hope we are making up for our delay by giving additional time today.,44,,
186,0.97,1970.601,1985.45,I want to note the importance of this legislation . Thank you for your work . We have from the office of housing Jennifer Labrecque with us.,44,,
187,0.97,1985.45,1994.459,"Traci Ratzliff is also joined by joy Hunt . I will hand it over to you, Jennifer.",44,,
188,0.97,1994.459,2004.569,"Council members, I will let Joanne go ahead and begin the presentation in front of you today.",45,,
189,0.97,2004.569,2032.096,"We have worked really closely with the office of housing on these two proposals to address some of the questions and concerns that have been raised by the Stakeholders that we are identifying today to address some of those concerns . again, our very first round of Mfte expiring . I will leave it to you and to Jen to go forward with the presentation.",45,,
190,0.97,2032.096,2045.076,"I will keep my comments brief . I want to say thank you to the office of housing and Traci for working with Erin house, who spent a lot of time on this as well.",46,,
191,0.97,2045.076,2063.294,I am really excited about the narrow legislation working to make sure it included monitoring requirements that this legislation will help to attract how this is functioning and including projects that we will I think see a huge benefit to the city.,46,,
192,0.97,2063.294,2064.495,Thanks for all of your work.,46,,
193,0.97,2064.495,2082.547,"Colleagues, this is a continuation of proposed--excuse me, a continuation of the review we had on the agenda from our August 17th meeting, so you have seen the materials and the packet before and this is our opportunity to walk through this in greater detail.",46,,
194,0.97,2082.547,2084.382,"I will turn it over to you, Jennifer.",46,,
195,0.97,2084.382,2088.052,"Good morning, Council members.",47,,
196,0.97,2088.052,2091.322,On Cue for having me back today to do a deeper dive into the legislation.,47,,
197,0.97,2091.322,2098.362,I will share my screen here.,47,,
198,0.97,2098.362,2111.442,"Somehow I think I ended up at the very end, so give me a moment . all right, again thank you for having me here today.",47,,
199,0.97,2111.442,2123.588,"I am Jennifer Labrecque, the planning and programs manager of the office of housing and I'm here to do a deeper dive into some proposed legislation to update the Mfte program to accommodate recent changes in the state law.",47,,
200,0.97,2123.588,2145.309,"As a reminder, the multifamily tax exemption program provides exemption and the entire residential portion of a property owner's tax bill and return for the property owner income either 20 or 25% of the units.",47,,
201,0.97,2145.309,2148.646,The remaining 75 or 80% of the units can be rented at full market rates.,47,,
202,0.97,2148.646,2162.627,"A tax exemption currently lasts for 12 years and at the end of that 12 year period of time, the Affordability restrictions in the tax exemption end.",47,,
203,0.97,2162.627,2192.823,"The program is authorized under state and implemented locally through an ordinance . As you all know, several changes were made to the and Cw authorizing the program . During the 2021 legislative session, the ones we're focused on today include that there is now a jurisdiction to provide a 12 year extension option for projects currently participating in the program.",47,,
204,0.97,2192.823,2201.332,There are relocation assistance that all jurisdictions have to require as part of the program.,47,,
205,0.97,2201.332,2220.084,"The Rcw allows for a longer tax exemption period for certain type of homeownership projects and jurisdictions are now allowed to have labor equity requirements as a condition of participation, if they so choose.",47,,
206,0.97,2220.084,2245.309,"We have chosen in our proposed legislation a pretty narrow and focused Pproach that is really about accommodating those changes to the Rcw that are time sensitive or required, things that the jurisdictions have to do and have to update their to acknowledge . We recognize there are programmatic goals not addressed with the narrow piece of legislation.",47,,
207,0.97,2245.309,2258.522,Part of that is because this is a difficult time to Calibrate or make changes to a budget based assistance program given the uncertainty in the real estate market caused by Covid.,47,,
208,0.97,2258.522,2268.199,"As such, we are proposing a resolution that States the intent to address other programmatic issues during renewal in 2023.",47,,
209,0.97,2268.199,2274.739,"The current program goes through December 31st, 2023.",47,,
210,0.97,2274.739,2284.115,"In 2023, city council will take up consideration and the intent of some of those programmatic issues at that time as well.",47,,
211,0.97,2284.115,2290.154,So we have three different sets of updates.,47,,
212,0.97,2290.154,2295.66,The first update addresses an extension option for a small set of properties expiring over the next two years.,47,,
213,0.97,2295.66,2311.242,"The second set of updates addresses Stabilit . The third update is a small one that has to do with a handful of homeownership projects . of course, there is the accompanying resolution.",47,,
214,0.97,2311.242,2317.181,So the first update I want to talk about is the extension update for rental projects.,47,,
215,0.97,2317.181,2328.359,We are proposing to provide an extension option for projects that are expiring in 2021 and 2022. that is nine projects.,47,,
216,0.97,2328.359,2337.501,Obviously there are other projects expiring and the idea is projects that expire in 2023 and beyond will be addressed during program renewal in 2023.,47,,
217,0.97,2337.501,2350.114,Overtime as you all know changes have been made to the Mfte program and considerations have been passed by city council.,47,,
218,0.97,2350.114,2366.464,"Some of the major ones include an introduction of an annual moderator which increases the maximum allowable rent to no more than 4.5% per year, and a requirement tenants can qualify for their unit on an annual basis and not just initial Visa.",47,,
219,0.97,2366.464,2375.973,These nine projects Predated requirements . They were bested under an older version of the program.,47,,
220,0.97,2375.973,2385.049,"However, if these projects offer the extension, the annual certification requirement will apply . We are essentially bringing these projects up to the current standards.",47,,
221,0.97,2385.049,2396.827,Additionally we are proposing Affordability levels . I will dive into the details of that in just a couple of minutes.,47,,
222,0.97,2396.827,2399.063,This is an overview.,47,,
223,0.97,2399.063,2404.969,These are the nine projects that are currently expiring over the next two years.,47,,
224,0.97,2404.969,2415.045,These projects all bested under Mfte programs so they came Online in 2009 or 2010.,47,,
225,0.97,2415.045,2443.073,These projects are under program 80% AMI or 90% AMI . These projects sort of Predated the land use codes . anything that could be considered a unit was regulated just like the studio.,47,,
226,0.97,2443.073,2451.282,So I want to provide some background on the proposed Affordability limits and then I can go into what those are.,47,,
227,0.97,2451.282,2462.793,"Under the Rcw, the Rcw requires extending properties meet at minimum the Affordability requirements from properties receiving a 12 year exemption.",47,,
228,0.97,2462.793,2473.637,"In other words at minimum extending properties would need to meet Affordability requirements established under program six, which city council passed.",47,,
229,0.97,2473.637,2483.314,"However, we also know that extending Mfte properties will be between 13 to 24 years old.",47,,
230,0.97,2483.314,2494.859,As such the extension limits are calibrated to give lower rents in older buildings as opposed to comparable newer buildings.,47,,
231,0.97,2494.859,2519.483,"This chart walks you through a few things . The column on the left here, those are the current Affordability limits for expiring projects . again, those are the program 3 income limits . A column on the Right- hand side shows the proposed Affordability limits for extensions, which are modestly lower than what is required under program six.",47,,
232,0.97,2519.483,2551.048,"Essentially 10% lower than what would be required for a new development . proposed Affordability limits are 30% for Sedus, 50% for studios, 60% for One-Bedrooms, 75% for two bedrooms, and 80% for three bedrooms.",47,,
233,0.97,2551.048,2583.314,"It can go higher for new exemptions, but if the project is to receive an extension, the cap is 80% AMI . So I wanted to move on to the second set of updates, which are around supporting tenant stability . We want to ensure that the changes that were implementing--or that we are implementing these changes in a way that provides tenant stability and prevents displacement.",47,,
234,0.97,2583.314,2599.763,This is especially important because in our proposal we are instituting annual income Certifications and lowering Amis . We know those changes could really have an impact on existing tenants.,47,,
235,0.97,2599.763,2626.19,"There are tenants that meet the new lower requirements, yet once their current lease expires . If a tenant qualifies, their rent will go down . tenants over the new income limits but within the old limits, the program three limits will be Grandfathered in at all levels.",47,,
236,0.97,2626.19,2634.798,Those units will continue to be designated as Mfte units and will count toward the Mfte set aside percentage.,47,,
237,0.97,2634.798,2645.376,"At unit turn, all Mfte units will convert to the new limits through the life of the extension.",47,,
238,0.97,2645.376,2653.384,So this chart provides an overview of the difference in rent that the tenants will see.,47,,
239,0.97,2653.384,2664.728,This would apply to a tenant who is currently playing program three rent but qualifies for the new extension rent.,47,,
240,0.97,2664.728,2671.402,They would see a pretty significant reduction in their rent.,47,,
241,0.97,2671.402,2678.909,The Rcw also made some changes in related to tenant protections.,47,,
242,0.97,2678.909,2706.637,"The Rcw now requires that property owners must pay tenants at or below 80% AMI--I'm sorry, Mfte tenants must pay at or below 80% AMI one month rent within 90 days of rent restriction ending . It is important to note that this relocation assistance does not apply universally across the Mfte portfolio.",47,,
243,0.97,2706.637,2716.08,It applies to new projects authorized after July of 2021 and to projects that choose the extension that reach the end of their 12 Mac year period.,47,,
244,0.97,2716.08,2735.399,It does not apply to most tenants in the portfolio . There is a notification requirement that property owners need to tell tenants about these relocation assistance . in the two years after they approached the rent restriction.,47,,
245,0.97,2735.399,2744.408,"And the final update is a fairly small one, but it is helpful for our permanently affordable ownership projects.",47,,
246,0.97,2744.408,2753.016,Right now the permanently affordable ownership project gets a tax exemption just like all of the other projects.,47,,
247,0.97,2753.016,2774.138,"Under the state they qualify for a 20 year exemption . I want to note that the Rcw has a pretty stringent definition of homeownership, so this can only be used for a pretty select type of project . their definition includes things like the 99 year ground lease.",47,,
248,0.97,2774.138,2781.145,It ensures it happens to households at or below 80% AMI.,47,,
249,0.97,2781.145,2794.625,It supports five affordable projects currently receiving city funding . We anticipate it will be usable to more projects as well in the coming years.,47,,
250,0.97,2794.625,2812.276,"And finally I just want to address the accompanying resolution . As I noted before, the legislation is accompanying a resolution to address other priorities during the renewal process in 2023.",47,,
251,0.97,2812.276,2842.206,"Resolution States affirmatively that Mfte will continue to achieve affordable housing, advanced labor equity outcomes, and provide an extension option for projects expiring after 2022 . As part of renewal consideration in 2023, Oh will provide information and analysis during renewal consideration . and that is all I have.",47,,
252,0.97,2842.206,2842.906,Thank you.,47,,
253,0.97,2842.906,2855.085,Thank you for walking us through this . very exciting with obviously more work to come on the horizon.,48,,
254,0.97,2855.085,2856.486,"Herbold, do you have a question?",48,,
255,0.97,2856.486,2857.221,Yes.,49,,
256,0.97,2857.221,2859.923,Thank you.,49,,
257,0.97,2859.923,2874.037,I want to talk a little bit about the relocation assistance requirement . can you first confirm for me that this is a relocation assistance requirement being authorized by the state?,49,,
258,0.97,2874.037,2878.308,"Yes, it is authorized under the Rcw.",50,,
259,0.97,2878.308,2883.513,Did the state identify 80% AMI as the threshold?,51,,
260,0.97,2883.513,2885.616,"Yes, they did.",52,,
261,0.97,2885.616,2946.41,"So I just want to flag this as something that is a really potentially useful precedent for us to use in trying to convince the state Legislature to change the threshold for the tenant relocation assistance program for tenants that are displaced because of renovation . right now the threshold is 60% AMI, so if the state Legislature in their wisdom is saying there should be relocation for tenants displaced because of large rent increases in these projects for tenants that earn 80%, I think we could potentially use that to convince them they should make changes in the state authorizing legislation for the tenant relocation assistance ordinance.",53,,
262,0.97,2946.41,2958.488,We cannot change our threshold in our program in the city of Seattle until they authorize it . I want to flag that for a potential item for the state legislative agenda this year.,53,,
263,0.97,2958.488,2968.799,"It is really, really helpful to see the state legislator made this wide choice.",53,,
264,0.97,2968.799,2971.501,I agree.,54,,
265,0.97,2971.501,2977.14,"Wonderful . Thank you very much, vice chair . any additional comments?",54,,
266,0.97,2977.14,2983.847,"All right, well I am excited about this.",54,,
267,0.97,2983.847,2988.151,I will get the legislation in front of us.,54,,
268,0.97,2988.151,2996.66,I understand there is a potential amendment to the resolution.,54,,
269,0.97,2996.66,2997.26,"Thanks again, Jennifer.",54,,
270,0.97,2997.26,3018.382,"I think this is going to be helpful for us as we consider additional priorities and as we take on the comprehensive plan in 2023, especially when we include these monitoring requirements . that will help us weigh policies and Trade-Offs and help us have a better understanding what the data provides for us . We will be able to make really informed decisions.",54,,
271,0.97,3018.382,3047.677,I also want to underscore a piece that Traci and Jennifer used as well . This is Knehr registration . people often reach out to us about Mfte and there will be follow-up action especially with some of the actions the Legislature earlier this year to address how we could continue to provide additional policy enhancements to the program.,54,,
272,0.97,3047.677,3087.651,"This is specific to the expiring units and we are granting program extensions for those projects to make sure that they don't expire in the Near- term . I think as you outlined, Jennifer, there are really good benefits to the community and positive impact for those that have been previously Grandfathered to the old requirements and coming into the fold of important protections as well, so that is good even though the legislation is narrow . I understand is really only applies to nine different projects, as you said.",54,,
273,0.97,3087.651,3098.428,I think that is another important piece and is something that will lead us to have important data in front of us . We will have more comprehensive changes to come.,54,,
274,0.97,3098.428,3118.982,"A lot of engagement . a lot of engagement with various community partners, Stakeholders on before we take on more with Mfte . as well as other labor unions in our community and housing providers as well.",54,,
275,0.97,3118.982,3119.95,Okay.,54,,
276,0.97,3119.95,3134.598,Let's move the resolution in front of us so we can consider that and then we will consider the legislation . I move the committee recommends passage of resolution 32017. is there a second?,54,,
277,0.97,3134.598,3135.298,Second.,55,,
278,0.97,3135.298,3136.399,Wonderful.,56,,
279,0.97,3136.399,3137.2,Thank you very much.,56,,
280,0.97,3137.2,3138.668,It has been moved and Seconded.,56,,
281,0.97,3138.668,3142.606,We do have one potential amendment.,56,,
282,0.97,3142.606,3152.015,"Councilmember Herbold, would you like to move to amend the resolution and then we will have you speak to it?",56,,
283,0.97,3152.015,3157.921,Thank you so much . Let's see here.,57,,
284,0.97,3157.921,3170.333,I move amendment one to resolution 32017.,57,,

You are doing an analysis about agreeing to extend those Mfte projects with an extension versus ending the program because the cost of the tax foregone is greater than what it might cost us to do in a buydown situation should owners of those Mfte projects expiring be willing to do so.",59,,
291,0.97,3226.59,3232.696,"Vice chair Herbold, would you like to add to that?",60,,

296,0.97,3291.755,3318.214,"The idea is we should figure out what the cost of the foregone tax is to the city and compare it to the cost of buying down the units and make sure whatever approach we are using, say the Affordability of these units, is an approach that is the most cost-effective for the city and for taxpayers.",61,,
297,0.97,3318.214,3338.768,"I am hoping that with this information, we will be able to examine whether or not rent buydown's are a tool we should be considering to preserve this particular set of affordable housing units as they are expiring.",61,,
