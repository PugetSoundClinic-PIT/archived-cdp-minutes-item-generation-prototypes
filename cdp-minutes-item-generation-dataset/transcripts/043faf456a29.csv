59,0.97,433.132,433.966,My name is BJ.,17,,
60,0.97,433.966,439.505,I'm calling on SPD's 2020 strategic plan.,17,,
61,0.97,439.505,447.947,That includes multiple inaccurate please such as claims that the budget in 2021 and 2021.,17,,
62,0.97,447.947,462.895,"Speaking of the budget in 2020, SPD and its defenders include a monitor that spent the first eight months of 2000 $0.21 any attempts to hold SPD responsible for overspending would somehow ruin the Department.",17,,
63,0.97,462.895,481.147,Spd continued this oversight in 2021 by shifting funding and pay for new projects prior to the projects sent to Council for approval . The plant also does not mention what SPD is currently doing.,17,,
64,0.97,481.147,504.837,"It does not talk about officers dealing with homeless Encampments . It does not mention allocating officers with prevention, it does not mention repeating discredited broken windows plans with officers and city blocks around the clock.",17,,
65,0.97,504.837,514.447,"What the client does mention largely technology and systems, all of which raise a lot of questions.",17,,
66,0.97,514.447,526.659,"We talk about looking at the data informed 911 on SPD responses to last year, two studies came out on criminal Jstice reform and law enforcement action ownership.",17,,
67,0.97,526.659,535.735,Those studies use different Methodologies and both found that SPD should be handling less than 30% of the calls it's currently handling.,17,,
68,0.97,535.735,546.913,"Spd has shifted zero call to Non-Spd solutions, so what is the status of that?",17,,
69,0.97,546.913,552.952,"What is the top priority in strategic planning, and what is being done?",17,,
70,0.97,552.952,565.364,Why is chair Herbold continued to drag this one out with additional analysis?,17,,
71,0.97,568.067,568.834,"Big Mac, BJ.",18,,
72,0.97,568.834,570.636,Our last Speaker is David Hanks.,18,,
73,0.97,570.636,570.87,David?,18,,
74,0.97,570.87,578.744,"Big Mac, David Hanks, District seven.",19,,
75,0.97,578.744,580.146,Public safety is at an all-time low.,19,,
76,0.97,580.146,585.117,"It's totally unsafe to go out in the city, yet the police chief refuses to arrest.",19,,
77,0.97,585.117,621.721,"Escalating violence . While lying about blaming cops for their problems so they can have easy payday doing politicking, Miss leading us, always blaming Council, city hall, and the Prosecutor's office in their greedy overtime not fighting budget for refusing to arrest, creating a bunch of--repeat offending mental health crisis Psychos.",19,,
78,0.97,621.721,635.434,"The police chief Ali forestry time for eight years a long time ago and have spent another 17 years not fighting street crime, instead working overtime getting rich and playing police propaganda with coffee outreach and flood data.",19,,
79,0.97,635.434,647.146,"The police chief has advertised every unit and created his own training program, and it's completely mismanaged the whole effort a proper policing.",19,,
80,0.97,647.146,679.345,"It is obvious the police chief is allowing media reports and following media reports and only sweeping out from hot spots that are allowing to continue crimes around the corner and other regional areas of hot spots but only times you have police taking credit is when you rely on the federal agency, only going up while Seattle police chief refuses to go after all the evil people connected to houses and traffickers, which results with people being robbed by another, resulting in gun violence.",19,,
81,0.97,679.345,688.354,It's obvious to me better police chief needs to be conducting more it.,19,,
82,0.97,688.354,693.926,Just take a look at the crime Seattle focuses on.,19,,
83,0.97,693.926,695.995,They don't --,19,,
84,0.97,695.995,725.791,"Thank you . Just want to note that in public comment, I ask that folks please refrain from making accusations or Impugning the motives of individuals and to keep your comments focused on policies and on activities of the city, so big Mac so much, that will end our public comment.",20,,
85,0.97,725.791,728.16,Please read item number one.,21,,
86,0.97,728.16,734.533,"Excuse me, committee agenda item, adoption of office of police accountability director search process.",22,,
87,0.97,734.533,754.754,"Thank you . item number one, as mentioned, earlier will relate to the adoption of the office of police accountability director search process . Greg Doss of Council central staff is here to present.",23,,
88,0.97,754.754,776.509,"We have senior deputy Mayor Harrell with us to explain both the need of this Council action as well as the proposed process moving forward . Greg, can you briefly summarize the action for us today?",23,,
89,0.97,776.509,777.543,"Good morning, Madam chair.",24,,
90,0.97,777.543,779.378,"Thank you, and good morning, members of the committee.",24,,
91,0.97,779.378,788.854,"The action before you today is a memo which will be put before you for a vote, and if you vote on the memo, then it will be forwarded to the clerk to be filed.",24,,
92,0.97,788.854,865.397,"The memo basically States that the accountability ordinance, which is section 3.2 9.115, governs the appointment of the OPA director, and that upon the vacancy of that director, it is the Mayor that has reappointment authority, and that the Mayor is required by the ordinance to make the appointment in 90 days and that if the Mayor does not make that appointment within 90 days consistent with the terms of the accountability ordinance, that appointment authority falls to this Committee, and so what the memo is doing is adopting the document that the deputy Mayor put before you on March 8th as the search process that the Mayor's office is going to use as the committee's own search process so the provisions of the accountability ordinance are being met, and the memo is more or less acting as an extension process, so that the Mayor's office has enough time to do the search, and the committee and the Mayor's office are in alignment on the search process.",24,,
93,0.97,865.397,870.669,That is an overview of what is happening here today.,24,,
94,0.97,870.669,882.548,"The clerk has asked that I show an updated search process, so with the chair's permission, I want to go ahead and do that.",24,,
95,0.97,882.548,890.189,Share my screen.,24,,
96,0.97,890.189,893.859,And this is not working.,24,,
97,0.97,893.859,895.427,There we go.,24,,
98,0.97,895.427,901.233,Can everyone see the new search process?,24,,
99,0.97,901.233,916.849,"Okay, so just a couple things to point out here Peter this is the same search process that the deputy Mayor presented on March 8th, exit you will see it is Versioin two.",24,,
100,0.97,916.849,918.25,A couple changes that have been made.,24,,
101,0.97,918.25,923.022,I think the chair noted it at the start of the hearing.,24,,
102,0.97,923.022,928.193,The first is that the search itself is going to be conducted by the Seattle Department of human resources instead of by an outside firm.,24,,
103,0.97,928.193,959.758,"The second is there is going to be a forum with the Finalists, so this updated version of the search process will be posted to and that will be posted to the Website after this, after this hearing, but wanted to share that with you so you're aware that the change was made, and as I said, we will adopt that search process as the committee's process of the Mayor and Committee are in alignment with the accountability ordinance.",24,,
104,0.97,959.758,960.626,"Perfect, thank you again.",25,,
105,0.97,960.626,1032.898,"I just want to say a few words about, I think, the language that is in the 2017 accountability ordinance was very forward thinking in that the responsibility for appointing an Opiate director falls to the public safety and human services Committee in those instances in which the Mayor does not act, and I think that was intended to eliminate the possibility for a situation where a new executive the Prioritizes the importance of filling this position, and I am very supportive of making sure that, that does not happen, and I am really glad that the Mayor has come to us with this request for additional time because it in itself in essence fulfills the intent of the ordinance, which is to just confirm that the executive Prioritizes this position as a very important component of our police accountability system here in Seattle.",25,,
106,0.97,1032.898,1078.41,"So I am happy to bring this forward and also want to think is a member Mosqueda for her suggestion in the last committee meeting, the addition of a public forum is critical, and I think we have seen with other high-profile appointment processes that that is sort of the standard in the city of Seattle and our public institutions that Finalists have an opportunity to meet with the public, and the public has an opportunity to meet with them, so I'm going to work to get the item in front of us, and if there are questions or comments, we can take them then.",25,,
107,0.97,1078.41,1086.852,I move that the committee with version 2 of the search process for the Mayor Bruce Harrell director.,25,,
108,0.97,1086.852,1089.688,Is there a second?,25,,
109,0.97,1089.688,1090.322,I can.,26,,

112,0.97,1096.395,1098.697,Thank you.,27,,
113,0.97,1098.697,1108.807,"Seeing none, it has been moved and Seconded that the OPA search process continue.",27,,
114,0.97,1108.807,1111.076,"After no comments, will the click please call the role?",27,,
115,0.97,1111.076,1113.345,Councilmember Mosqueda?,28,,

151,0.97,1269.134,1309.174,"Just to set the stage, we wanted to talk a little bit first about what we worked on as our race and social justice strategy . really, looking at Aligning everything that we do with race and social justice principles so that we help all communities in Seattle build resilience, and what that means is that communities are able to not only withstand challenges that might occur during a disaster or right after a disaster, but what are the things that are challenging for them all the time, meeting people where they are, intentional focus on those most impacted by structural racism.",46,,
152,0.97,1309.174,1323.755,"It's really important to note that if people are not able to do their daily activities and have daily challenges, they are not going to be taking a preparedness, so we're looking at that all the time.",46,,

154,0.97,1343.975,1351.717,"So, there are a number of challenges in emergency management as there are in most of government, not the least of which is having dedicated funding for all of our outreach activities.",47,,
155,0.97,1351.717,1352.884,"Currently, we don't have that.",47,,
156,0.97,1352.884,1368.7,"We did have some Uasi funds dedicated to outreach, and that does not go away.",47,,
157,0.97,1368.7,1369.968,That does not change our work.,47,,
158,0.97,1369.968,1376.775,"That just means we are looking for other ways to do good work, and sometimes, funding is a barrier to bring everyone to the table that needs to have their voices heard.",47,,
159,0.97,1376.775,1383.248,I know that you are aware that Bipoc communities are significantly impacted by National disasters at a higher rate than their white counterparts.,47,,
160,0.97,1383.248,1405.804,"Usually, this is tied to either lack of individual or family wealth, and as I mentioned earlier, if folks are concerned about daily challenges, then they are not going to be thinking about preparedness there's a higher concentration of Bipoc communities in areas where there is elevated vulnerability.",47,,
161,0.97,1405.804,1412.811,"It could be the neighborhood, buildings are unsafe, or they have not had any maintenance in quite some time.",47,,
162,0.97,1412.811,1425.624,They may live closer to water bodies or places that have landslides for obvious reasons.,47,,
163,0.97,1425.624,1496.328,"So in emergency management, we like to think of what we do as consequence management, and that means what is happening after an event of occurs, and then we come in and help people work on how they will recover from that . But it really is only successful if there is work done in the preparedness and mitigation space prior to an event, so looking at what our community's needs, what are their challenges, that also, for this to be the most successful, those root causes of why people are most wonderful will need to be addressed for there to be substantive change, and that's really the job of all of government, so all of the city, and we have that commitment from our other city departments to looking at how do we make those substantive changes prior to a disaster before the disaster occurs . So, mitigating risk also in a physical environment can get really expensive, and as you know, grant requirements from the Federal Government and other sources are usually pretty complex and have very strict requirements about what you can spend money on.",47,,
164,0.97,1496.328,1515.714,"So just a quick NOTE about an example of mitigating risk in the physical environment would be retrofitting of Unreinforced masonry buildings, which I know you're all familiar with . It takes a number of years for that to occur.",47,,
165,0.97,1515.714,1519.451,"You have to displace people while you're doing that work, so those are all factors we think about.",47,,
166,0.97,1519.451,1529.528,"Also, the unequal access for communities due to their lack of trust of government . It may be a cultural thing.",47,,
167,0.97,1529.528,1547.379,"It also may be a lack of resources, so those are the challenges that we look at when we're thinking about involving the community and asking them what makes the most sense to them, so just to kind of give you an overall picture of what we're thinking about prior to engaging with the community.",47,,
168,0.97,1547.379,1551.65,"All right, next slide?",47,,
169,0.97,1551.65,1567.098,"So today, these are the projects you will hear about, how we changed our emergency management planning policies so that it is more inclusive, and we really hear a lot from the community that we serve . We'll also talk to you briefly about workforce rallying points.",48,,
170,0.97,1567.098,1579.244,"A program we call stop the bleeding which is a disaster skills training, and also our community safety Ambassador program.",48,,
171,0.97,1579.244,1582.347,"So, next slide, then I will hand it to see a.",48,,
172,0.97,1582.347,1587.152,"Thanks, curry.",49,,
173,0.97,1587.152,1593.291,"So when developing emergency plans, OEM serves as a Convener.",49,,
174,0.97,1593.291,1599.898,"We hold the pen and rely on the various departments and organizations we speak to to describe their capabilities, which then become the foundation of the city's response plans.",49,,
175,0.97,1599.898,1633.331,"We have great processes and standing committees and play for collecting this input from other departments and from partner organizations, but historically, the community input on plan has been primarily provided by predominately white volunteer groups . and obviously, this can lead to the mismatch we sometimes see where the city's services during disaster are going unrealized, what the community's needs remain Unaddressed.",49,,
176,0.97,1633.331,1640.138,"Early last year, we finalized a policy that Dovetails with our office's existing outreach plan and explicitly defines how we will conduct community focused outreach for different kinds of documents.",49,,
177,0.97,1640.138,1659.958,"By better understanding our Bipoc community's needs during disasters, we can improve our plans overall and especially our plans and assumptions around helping the city's most vulnerable community members during disasters.",49,,
178,0.97,1659.958,1661.059,Next slide?,49,,
179,0.97,1661.059,1676.074,"So, here are a few of the Rsj benefits.",50,,
180,0.97,1676.074,1686.918,"At a very high level, just having the policy has improved the transparency of our government processes, so people can understand how they might provide input into the planning process, and it has institutionalized the need to speak to the people who would be most directly impacted by disaster response plans.",50,,
181,0.97,1686.918,1694.092,"At a more practical level, implementing the policy is providing valuable input into specific plans.",50,,
182,0.97,1694.092,1711.242,"We will be updating the city's evacuation to our outreach team conducted a pilot focus groups to understand the community's needs and Excitations around evacuation, how they would expect to be notified, what would encourage them or prevent them from taking action, and so on.",50,,
183,0.97,1711.242,1726.424,"In the coming weeks, we'll be conducting focus groups on extreme heat, then we can take what we learned from that to our colleagues within the city and with partner organizations to discuss how we can collectively improve our response.",50,,
184,0.97,1726.424,1743.575,"Some of the cities' emergency plans are more internal facing, so the community we need to gather input on from is the city workforce, and the workforce rallying points are an example of this, and I will discuss more in the next slide.",50,,
185,0.97,1743.575,1749.013,One lesson we learned that we implemented this new policy is the importance of Reimbursing community partners for their time and input in our planning processes.,50,,
186,0.97,1749.013,1763.461,"This is something our office has not had the budget for in the past, and so for the current and planned outreach we have right now as curry mentioned, we've been able to use one-time funding such as urban security initiative funding, but as Tey will discuss more, the spending is unreliable.",50,,
187,0.97,1763.461,1769.234,Next slide?,50,,
188,0.97,1769.234,1800.832,"Catastrophic earthquake would damage transportation and communications infrastructure, preventing city staff from reaching their work assignments and preventing remote work, while simultaneously creating an unprecedented need for skilled workers . The workforce rallying points are a strategy to address this, and I do want to emphasize that our Constructs specifically for the big one, a big one that causes systemwide communications and transformation failures.",51,,
189,0.97,1800.832,1814.045,A workforce rallying point is essentially a predetermined location for city staff who are unable to make it to their normal work location can show up and be connected with the citywide response and guidance via amateur radio operators.,51,,
190,0.97,1814.045,1846.644,"This planning Advantis equity by supporting decentralized response and decision-making, meaning the responders that are on the ground in an impacted neighborhood who, by design, are more likely to live in that neighborhood, are the ones determining that community's needs . We're structuring the guidance at the rallying points to identify key community Lifelines and gathering places where staff should go to learn about spontaneous community response efforts and hear from the community what their gaps are.",51,,
191,0.97,1846.644,1857.989,"We're building guidance to emphasize supporting and empowering community response because we know that after catastrophic disaster, government alone will not be enough.",51,,
192,0.97,1857.989,1872.136,We're doing work now in the initial planning stages to bring in labor partners and frontline staff to ensure we do this planning with internal staff equity considerations in mind.,51,,
193,0.97,1872.136,1878.142,"And we are still in the early stages of planning, so perhaps next year, we'll be able to present a follow-up in how successful we were in these areas.",51,,
194,0.97,1878.142,1885.316,"Next slide, and Tey, I will hand it over to you.",51,,
195,0.97,1885.316,1886.15,"Big Mac, Lucia.",52,,
196,0.97,1886.15,1886.751,"A tie, everyone.",52,,
197,0.97,1886.751,1900.965,"I am Tey Thach . At OEM, I will be talking about two programs in our community engagement team, and the first one is thought would lead.",52,,
198,0.97,1900.965,1902.967,"As mentioned earlier, this is grant funded.",52,,
199,0.97,1902.967,1906.504,By the Uasi grant.,52,,
200,0.97,1906.504,1945.777,"Stopped the bleed is a national program that teaches individuals how to stop a person from bleeding out, whether it be how to use a Tourniquet or how to pack a wound, and the outcome for this program is for Bipoc and Underserved community members to be prepared to respond to a mass casualty event or incident here you know, the general goal is to save lives.",52,,
201,0.97,1945.777,1981.813,"We partner with Community-Based organizations or nonprofit organizations to train staff on stop the bleed, and the program is currently managed by an individual in our team, but we have volunteers go out and teach the skills . to be able to go out and teach stop the bleed, you must be a Paramedic, Rn, physician's assistant, medical doctor who has successfully completed eight bleeding control provider course.",52,,
202,0.97,1981.813,2043.841,"Currently, we have six volunteers going out to teach, and the program started in 2018, and we taught 621 individuals since 2018, but due to Covid, the number was not as big as we all wanted it to be, but with restrictions lifting, you know, recently, our last class, we taught Seattle Armory services class, and we had 66 attendees, so we expect the number of individuals taught to increase this year . We have purchased 85 stop the bleed kits which we distributed to nonprofit and Community-Based organizations in the Seattle area, and we hope to get those staff from those Nonprofits trained up on stop the bleed.",52,,
203,0.97,2043.841,2082.647,"Again, it is funded by Uasi, so it has the terrorism tied to it, so we are looking to train organizations that have high foot traffic, but we hope to be able to not be so reliant on the Uasi grant anymore and to focus training Seattle folks on how to stop the bleed in a more individual basis and for general community, not just staff that works Community- based organizations, so that is one program.",52,,
204,0.97,2082.647,2084.282,That the real quick question on that one?,52,,
205,0.97,2084.282,2084.682,Thank you.,52,,
206,0.97,2084.682,2095.126,"Can you just--is there an annual MS with Covid, the numbers have reduced.",52,,
207,0.97,2095.126,2112.076,"Is there an annual goal for the number of Trainings you strive to do, and just talk a little bit more about how you can and that's how you are assuring that you are reaching the target population, specifically by pocket Underserved community members.",52,,
208,0.97,2112.076,2149.847,"The goal, it's as many people as possible, and we are looking at Community-Based organizations that serve Bipoc communities, so that is how we target our organizations if we go on the Website and say they make a comment about their focus is on Bipoc Underserved community spirit we invite them to apply for a stop the bleed kit, and everyone is welcome to apply.",52,,
209,0.97,2149.847,2167.932,"But we do target those communities and make sure that, Hey, this is free . The kit is free, and we provide training for you.",52,,
210,0.97,2167.932,2169.033,Does that answer the question?,52,,
211,0.97,2169.033,2185.85,"I remember a few years ago, I received an advocacy request to get this program in the public high schools . I'm wondering is there a program like this in the high schools?",53,,
212,0.97,2185.85,2202.266,"Not to my knowledge . We are in the beginning stages of trying to start a youth program with Seattle public schools in mind, and I think stop the bleed would be great for them.",54,,
213,0.97,2202.266,2205.536,Thank you.,55,,
214,0.97,2205.536,2227.892,"All right . The second program is the community safety ambassadors program, and this program has been around six since 2014, and it is funded by a Uasi grant.",56,,
215,0.97,2227.892,2272.103,"The Rsji . As curry mentioned earlier on disasters impact low income Bipoc folks the most, and with community safety ambassadors, they are individual vendors that are Multilingual . Some speak three languages, who live in the Seattle area, and they are trained in disaster preparedness, and they go out and provide outreach and engagement to their language community.",56,,
216,0.97,2272.103,2280.444,We currently have Csas providing outreach and engagement in 12 languages.,56,,
217,0.97,2280.444,2332.163,"Here are just some pictures of Csas in action . They go out and present on topics such as disaster preparedness, heat and winter preparedness, alert Seattle education, which alerts Seattle is the city's official alert and warning system, so they teach folks how to sign up for that today teach Cpr education, 911 education, disaster skills classes, and disaster skill classes include how to use a fire Extinguisher, how to shut off your gas after a major disaster, how to clean water, all in language.",56,,
218,0.97,2335.733,2342.073,"It's important to note not just in language, but Csas also provide a cultural know-how, a cultural lens to the community that they teach because they do come from that community.",56,,
219,0.97,2342.073,2350.481,"And I say that because, you know, not all cultures, not all cultures view disaster preparedness the same way.",56,,
220,0.97,2350.481,2372.203,"So, they bring that understanding on how to engage, and they not only go out and teach classes, but they also provide me with feedback on, Okay, this presentation would work for this community, or you should approach this topic this way, so they, again, provide cultural know-how.",56,,
221,0.97,2372.203,2394.125,"Communities that they work with, Lep communities, Bipoc communities, elderly communities, low income communities, again, all populations that we know are impacted more by major disasters.",56,,
222,0.97,2394.125,2424.288,"Under the CSA program, we also work with Community-Based organizations that help us cast a wider net to the populations we want to serve, so in the past three years, we've had partnerships with international rescue Committee, Pacific Islander community, and Villa Comunitaria.",56,,
223,0.97,2424.288,2426.557,"We print materials, getting things translated, paying Csas for their time.",56,,
224,0.97,2426.557,2442.006,"Again, it is all funded by the Uasi grant that will probably not be here in the next year or so . and, you know, that is the CSA program.",56,,
225,0.97,2442.006,2449.58,"It's been around since 2015, and it is still going strong, and we're continuing to look for funding for that program as well.",56,,
226,0.97,2449.58,2456.253,And I think this next slide is curry.,56,,
227,0.97,2456.253,2464.628,"Great, thanks very much, Tey and Lucia.",57,,
228,0.97,2464.628,2465.196,Really appreciate it.,57,,
229,0.97,2465.196,2469.733,Just to sum things up and give you another lens to look at what it is we've been working on.,57,,
230,0.97,2469.733,2495.159,"So, our accomplishments last year included one, realigning stopping for equitable engagement, so moving forward, we are talking about the volunteer program that had kind of the same group of people all the time, so that planner position really looks at how we engage different parts of the community to get really good data on how our planning efforts affect people and whether or not that makes sense to them.",57,,
231,0.97,2495.159,2515.079,"The image that you see here is part of our--the way that we look at the analysis of earthquake impacts, so part of our Seattle hazard identification and vulnerability analysis, which is part of our overall emergency planning, but also part of our planning efforts including mitigation.",57,,
232,0.97,2515.079,2546.01,"We have looked at not only who is going to be impacted, but what makes them vulnerable, whether it's the neighborhood they live in, whether or not they have access to a highway or access to resources, so there is a social vulnerability piece that is rated as part of that hazard identification, so it's not just what are the hazards, but how does it affect the people that are close by.",57,,
233,0.97,2546.01,2570.234,"We also did some work this past year with the Afghan community outreach under the CSA program, and also, the International rescue committee to provide disaster preparedness education for newly arrived immigrants from the Afghan community, letting them know what are the hazards in Seattle, how do they prepare for those, and who else could they connect with.",57,,
234,0.97,2570.234,2602.199,"We also made sure that our application process for partner organizations to be engaged with us or to apply for grants had the lowest barrier possible, including providing someone that would help them go through that process and really understand what the application is about and how best to access those resources . We're also really proud of the seismic retrofit of the apartments that was completed last year.",57,,
235,0.97,2602.199,2632.863,"That was an Unreinforced masonry building . This project was the first time that a partner organization that was not a government organization could apply for that mitigation money to do that retrofit, and they were successful in doing that and Partnering with us and learning the ropes and everything for a FEMA application, so that was just finished.",57,,
236,0.97,2632.863,2636.0,It's very exciting that the Brehmer apartments are very close by here in downtown Seattle.,57,,
237,0.97,2636.0,2640.07,"So, next slide, please?",57,,
238,0.97,2640.07,2646.176,"So, just wrapping up, I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have about our presentation.",58,,
239,0.97,2646.176,2651.348,Thank you again for inviting us again.,59,,
240,0.97,2651.348,2662.626,"I do have a couple additional questions, but I will pause to see if any other Councilmembers may have some before I go ahead.",59,,
241,0.97,2662.626,2666.13,"All right, not seeing any.",59,,
242,0.97,2666.13,2675.506,"Maybe they will Chime in afterwards, but I just want to talk a little bit more about earthquake training exercises.",59,,
243,0.97,2675.506,2745.476,"You know, we have heard the message that individuals will be expected to take care of themselves for at least the first 10 days after a major earthquake . I appreciate understanding a little bit for the city staff response hubs throughout the city nearby where people live in order to inject some equity principles to the city response . I'm wondering are there other things that the city is doing to help repair and support vulnerable Bipoc communities who aren't in a position to set aside resources to maintain themselves for at least 10 days, and I want to understand a little bit about whether or not this year's earthquake training and exercises address the tools and resources needed to help Bipoc communities after a major earthquake, okay?",59,,
244,0.97,2745.476,2746.977,"Oh great, thank you for that question.",59,,
245,0.97,2746.977,2748.712,Always like talking about earthquake preparedness.,59,,
246,0.97,2748.712,2770.367,"So, in addition to being concerned about those most portable and Bipoc communities in particular, we really are focused on helping everybody that lives and works and plays or is in Seattle at any time, so there is two things.",59,,
247,0.97,2770.367,2780.11,"One is helping those who do have the resources to understand what it is they need to do, so they can be on their own, and we can focus on those who were not able to do that.",59,,
248,0.97,2780.11,2853.383,"A couple things we do related are--the workforce rallying point as part of that effort to help communities is because most likely with the catastrophic earthquake, they will be geographically isolated areas throughout the city based on how the damage occurs to bridges, freeways, Overpasses, all of those things will make it so there are communities that are isolated and can't get to other places, so by having workforce rallying points where we can have city workforce that are trained in different disciplines, so not just emergency management, but transportation or, you know, human resources or whatever those departments that might help is that they have a location where they can rally, if you will, or go to to start to provide information about what the damage is in that particular area and work with other city personnel to get those resources to those folks, so that is one piece.",59,,
249,0.97,2853.383,2880.51,"The other will take funding, but we're also looking at having Community-Based resources placed throughout the city in those areas that we believe, based on hazard analysis and seismic hazard analysis of where those communities will be impacted and isolated, then having resources strategically place there.",59,,
250,0.97,2880.51,2882.946,We have been looking at that for a while.,59,,
251,0.97,2882.946,2898.395,"We sometimes call--you might hear the term preparedness Islands, and it would be exactly that, strategically placed resources so people, if they are isolated, don't have to go outside.",59,,
252,0.97,2898.395,2914.378,"The community preparedness is also an important piece for people who can't, for whatever reason, space reasons, income, they are worried about what they are doing on a day-to-day basis and don't have time to plan for preparedness.",59,,
253,0.97,2914.378,2968.999,"If you do things in the community and with the community group the people already trust and have them do collective preparedness activities, that is also hopeful so we don't expect everyone to have, you know, a bunch of supplies in their house or garage or car, so we are looking at a number of those things to address those issues . Also, awareness of what the hazards are and how you are likely to be on your own is a really big part of preparing, and that goes back to working with the Csas, the community safety ambassadors to understand what communities are thinking about and to also give them some information about how they might be isolated for a while, where to go to get that community support, and plugged into the preparedness of those organizations.",59,,
254,0.97,2968.999,2997.794,"So, just to be clear, though, there aren't stockpiles of food and water to survive 10 days located in areas where we know there are high concentrations of Bipoc and vulnerable community spirit that is something we're working towards.",60,,
255,0.97,2997.794,2998.962,Is that what I am hearing?,60,,
256,0.97,2998.962,3020.317,"Oh Yeah, it's a little more Nuanced than that because there are community organizations that do have supplies, some Faith-Based organizations and some other community groups do, so where there are currently supplies?",60,,
257,0.97,3020.317,3022.919,Part of our job is making sure people know where to get that.,60,,
258,0.97,3022.919,3034.631,"But if we have the funding, absolutely, we would have, seven to 10 places throughout the city where we know you're not going to be able to go to this grant are this part of the freeway is likely to be down, and you're not going to get past that.",61,,
259,0.97,3034.631,3049.379,"Where is the community resource Hub, if you will, or cash of supplies? that would take additional funding for us to be able to do that, but we're already planning what that would look like and how to properly invest strategically placed resources, so Yeah, I appreciate the question.",61,,
260,0.97,3049.379,3049.813,Thank you.,61,,
261,0.97,3049.813,3051.214,Thank you.,62,,
262,0.97,3051.214,3055.719,We don't have any additional questions.,62,,
263,0.97,3055.719,3059.99,Not seeing any from my colleagues.,62,,
264,0.97,3059.99,3075.639,"Again, really appreciate all the care that goes into this work, care for our city and care for the resiliency of our residents, so again, thank you for being with us today.",62,,
265,0.97,3075.639,3076.873,Thank you for having us.,63,,
266,0.97,3076.873,3078.875,I appreciate the opportunity.,63,,
267,0.97,3078.875,3080.61,Thank you.,63,,

346,0.97,3648.745,3655.752,"[Laughter] one other question, and Brian, if this is covered in your presentation, I'm happy to hold it, but on the",79,,
347,0.97,3655.752,3695.191,"Of officer wellness, as a High-Priority retention policy that was recommended several years ago in a retention and hiring study that I think came out in 2019, moving the staffing to a model, and I know that the Department has been experimenting with a pilot to do so.",80,,
348,0.97,3695.191,3699.095,I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about that.,80,,
349,0.97,3699.095,3700.329,I can follow up on that.,81,,
350,0.97,3700.329,3705.535,"We are still working with the Union on a schedule, just working out some of the details.",81,,
351,0.97,3705.535,3716.245,One of the concerns in general is just the staffing level and making sure that there is not some sort of mandatory overtime.,81,,
352,0.97,3716.245,3748.177,"The whole goal is to, you know, for wellness, and people would get time off and then to put on some level of mandatory overtime would not be in the best interest of us, so those are things we are still working through in detail, but we know that getting more people days off, setting their days off, more recovery time makes it much more competitive not only for our officers to be well, to have a level of wellness, but it's competitive or with other jurisdictions as well.",81,,
353,0.97,3748.177,3768.498,"My recollection, maybe I am remembering incorrectly, but you had started separate from the discussions with Spud that we had actually started to try out a pilot of Fort Ann's.",82,,
354,0.97,3768.498,3775.471,Is it incentive to move folks over to the new unit that you temporarily created?,82,,
355,0.97,3775.471,3776.305,Am I remembering correctly?,82,,
356,0.97,3776.305,3778.908,"If I am right, were there any lessons learned from that pilot?",82,,
357,0.97,3778.908,3781.711,"So our patrol, our patrol deployment is not on a 4-10.",83,,
358,0.97,3781.711,3787.917,"However, our community response is on a 4-10.",83,,
359,0.97,3787.917,3812.141,"That is the new group I created in 2020 to be able to respond to the emerging needs and also have a time frame of them during the calls per service during the day, so they have really appreciated that schedule, and many of them stayed on just because of the schedule cute even though the hours have changed, you know, when they were in patrol schedule.",83,,
360,0.97,3812.141,3816.312,"So, those are things we're all looking at and evaluating, taking that information as we move forward on the 4-10S.",83,,
361,0.97,3816.312,3817.813,"Great, that's very helpful.",84,,
362,0.97,3817.813,3827.99,I think that folks have stayed on in that unit for the schedule I think tells us a lot.,84,,
363,0.97,3827.99,3836.566,"Appreciate your efforts in that area, important area of officer wellness and retention.",84,,
364,0.97,3836.566,3838.935,Thank you.,84,,
365,0.97,3838.935,3847.376,"Brian, do you want to take it away?",84,,
366,0.97,3847.376,3862.491,"That pitcher, Councilmember, and thank you for the opportunity to talk about the Eaq, equity, accountability and quality program we are developing at the Seattle police Department.",84,,
367,0.97,3862.491,3876.339,"From the outset, let me say I have a Masters in public administration and routinely use data in my daily job to understand Department operations and officer activities.",84,,
368,0.97,3876.339,3880.71,I just got to get right out of you and say I know enough about this program can be dangerous.,84,,
369,0.97,3880.71,3914.677,"The math that is involved in this and the Analytics are at a level that I grasp and understand, but I do understand the Functionality of the program and how it's going to be very, very useful to the Department, so I will say up front this will be an introduction to what it is we're doing, but in order to get more in depth, we'll probably want to schedule a follow-up session with some of our actual researchers to present the detailed explanation for what is happening here that being said, this math, these come look in the Analytics that the program uses, it's all open source, we're going to be putting it out publicly.",84,,
370,0.97,3914.677,3915.845,There is nothing to hide here.,84,,
371,0.97,3915.845,3927.456,"We are not doing some secret sauce math, so it would be available for public consumption to pick this apart, give us better suggestions on how we can approach this.",84,,
372,0.97,3927.456,3929.525,"So, what is this thing?",84,,
373,0.97,3929.525,3972.368,"The equity, accountability, and quality program is an advanced Analytics program that analyzes outcomes, officer activity, using a clinical research model and scoring to determine processes across the Department . so as I think you are all where Oh where of, as part of incentive, of the development of the Seattle police Department data Analytics platform, and that connect most data around officer activities and performance and allows that analysis and presentation of that data.",84,,
374,0.97,3972.368,3982.912,"Historically, SPD has reported out on our crisis contacts, our stops, arrests, use of force, and a common question has been about disparities that are identified in police activities.",84,,
375,0.97,3982.912,4020.583,"Whether those disparities are driven by police behavior or simply reflect the disparities generated upstream of government interaction . and, you know, I would submit the answer to that has been primarily driven by beliefs, not data, and there are mechanisms that have been used historically as to throw officer activity or any government activity over population census data to determine whether there is any disparity in comparing the outcomes of the officer activity and the representation of any demographic in the Census data.",84,,
376,0.97,4020.583,4042.772,"This methodology has been long disparaged in the research community as the center for policing equity said, the science of justice, race, arrests, police use of force.",84,,
377,0.97,4044.073,4052.415,"Population benchmarks only provide a crude method for estimating Disproportionality, and in particular, they do not allow for clear inference as to whether the police activity is the proportionate to presence in any particular area or to legitimately provocative behavior.",84,,
378,0.97,4052.415,4065.961,"And by doing this type of analysis, it really has put the Seattle police Department on the defensive and at a disadvantage because there are clear disparities when you throw officer activity over population data.",84,,
379,0.97,4065.961,4079.675,"But Frustratingly, this methodology, and we submit it's not a very good one, really does not provide actionable intelligence for improving our activities.",84,,
380,0.97,4079.675,4081.61,"How do we, based on the information we have, improve?",84,,
381,0.97,4081.61,4089.452,"We set out to solve this, and the Eaq, the equity, accountability, and quality, really has three aspects.",84,,
382,0.97,4089.452,4103.532,"The equity aspect, the E, attempts to resolve this problem of disparities using statistical modeling, and so we start with the decision to Frisk.",84,,
383,0.97,4103.532,4111.74,"Basically, by controlling for all the collecting variables, and there's over 100 of them, the Department is able to identify decisions Systemically . This is not the individual officer level.",84,,
384,0.97,4111.74,4125.855,"We are looking for patterns and areas and these outcomes, but this allows us to find the patterns that are only driven by subject race data.",84,,
385,0.97,4125.855,4133.929,"In other words, we're able to control that and see, really, what, but we cannot explain except by the subject race.",84,,
386,0.97,4133.929,4197.593,"And this is done, you know, in the Frisk context by looking at perceptions of Dangerousness, which is a proxy for implicit bias in human decision-making, and by looking at this, we're able to then develop a company has a program about what do we do with this data, and we are starting a program where we are going to on a monthly basis provide this information to leadership, and when they look at the patterns, and I look at the information in these dashboard so we're able to present, we can start having commendable discussions about what is driving this, if there has been a change in criminal activity that may have some racial underpinning could that could explain dispute I would not necessarily be an hour data, but the important part here is, while the information that we're putting forth in these matters does not need any decision to Frisk with racist are Biased.",84,,
387,0.97,4197.593,4226.021,"It means these are the ones that SPD identifies as we do not have an alternative Exhalation other than race, so it NARROWS the focus and allows for a real conversation on far more Nuanced data, and it's fascinating to look at because, you know, in some areas, in some locations and time periods, disparities flip, and, you know, we're actually over Frisking members of the white population as opposed to the nonwhite population.",84,,
388,0.97,4226.021,4239.635,"One interesting thing here is, you know, I know there will be concerns about how we calculate this, and in our data, there are a lot of unknowns on subjects stopped.",84,,
389,0.97,4239.635,4254.817,"It is something we are working in the training to resolve, but in this analysis, an unknown defaults to not white in the analysis, so to any degree we're putting our thumb on the scale, it's actually to assume that race is a driving factor.",84,,
390,0.97,4254.817,4263.058,"You know, this, this type of work is unprecedented at a police Department.",84,,
391,0.97,4263.058,4294.823,"These analyses have been conducted in research, in Cambridge's is the most notable, but that is based on information that has occurred after the fact here this is a real-time application to directly shape operations, and it's actually a pretty novel step in policing, and I'm pretty excited to see how this rolls out, so that is the E in Ea Q, the accountability.",84,,
392,0.97,4294.823,4309.104,"What we're looking at is hot and cold spots in policing, and you have these competing allegations of over policing in communities and under policing in some communities, and often those allegations are coming from the same community, so the perception is are we there too much, for the wrong reasons, what is driving our Deployments?",84,,
393,0.97,4309.104,4319.381,"So, what we did is took the AVL data.",84,,
394,0.97,4319.381,4332.328,"This is our Gps data, and place it over calls for service, and we developed a heat map which shows where we are needed based on called and where we are over present, where there is less call activity.",84,,
395,0.97,4332.328,4345.541,"At the most basic level, this controls demand for service and visualizes our discretionary police presence, and this tells us about opportunities for problem solving in cold spots and shows hot spots where demand does not support the measure.",84,,
396,0.97,4345.541,4345.841,Hot spots.,84,,
397,0.97,4345.841,4355.918,"This is going to allow us to look at our Deployments, how we're managing it, and how we make operational decisions to make sure we are where we are needed.",84,,
398,0.97,4355.918,4363.859,"The last piece, and this is highly other development, and I look forward to presenting again on this.",84,,
399,0.97,4363.859,4365.094,Is it really the quality piece?,84,,
400,0.97,4365.094,4376.705,"For this, we are using an application that I think we are still in the middle of attaining.",84,,
401,0.97,4376.705,4377.74,Somewhere in the contract level.,84,,
402,0.97,4377.74,4397.659,"What this application will do will read and classify information from data, and this will give us an estimation of Qality service based on an analysis all recorded information that will look at expressed levels, be able to read and classify information from these volume count data.",84,,
403,0.97,4397.659,4435.464,"So those are three things that are in the system as it's being developed right now, and the E part exists, the accountability part exists, and the quality piece is still being filled, but once this system is in place, we'll be able to add new components to it, and what we would be able to do is look at officer discretion in making those stops so, in sum, this is a high-level statistical approach to better understand our activities, to explain them and correct them when needed.",84,,
404,0.97,4435.464,4437.9,And I will stop there for questions.,84,,
405,0.97,4437.9,4438.534,Thank you.,85,,
406,0.97,4438.534,4482.444,"I just want to note that funding for the Ea Q was a technology investment that the Council debated during the budget discussions, and it was technology investment that the Council was considering cutting . My recollection is that the monitor for the consent to create weight in, and they let us know that, from his perspective, that was a bad idea, and so there is high interest I think in the utility of the data analysis for purposes of compliance with consent to create.",85,,
407,0.97,4482.444,4492.287,"I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that, and two, I want to flag this and as I'm very interested in this",85,,
408,0.97,4492.287,4494.122,", first let me preface my comment with that.",86,,
409,0.97,4494.122,4538.3,"When we talked about this presentation, I thought we were going to cover the strategic plan, and that is the document that is available for public review with the agenda . If we're going to do a deep dive in the element of the strategic plan, because there was such high interest in this particular line of work, it would be great to get some advanced materials on that so we have the benefit of having maybe a more robust conversation . that would be super appreciated, but that said, maybe you can tell us a little bit more about how the Eaq relates to our commitments and obligations under the consent degree.",86,,
410,0.97,4538.3,4546.842,Task and I can briefly just mention as we covered the strategic plan that we obviously cover the relational pleasing earlier on?,86,,
411,0.97,4546.842,4550.445,Eaq is just a component of it.,87,,
412,0.97,4550.445,4565.227,"We will do something that's a little bit more comprehensive for a deeper dive into it, but I did want and that is one of the foundations we're building out from our strategic plan, so I wanted to have just a little bit of a Snapshot into it today, so.",87,,
413,0.97,4565.227,4581.443,"I guess I'm just reacting to the fact that I already feel that it's like up here, even though I realize that in reality, we're just dumping our toe in, so thank you.",88,,
414,0.97,4581.443,4615.544,"And Councilmember, as chief said, fully expect to do a full presentation to this Committee on this, where we will actually have physical and get materials in advance, so you can really dig into this, but I think the impetus for bringing it for today is that we are really excited about this, and certainly, I spent a lot of time looking at other police departments, and I've never seen anything that approaches this level of sophistication, so I too am very excited about.",89,,
415,0.97,4615.544,4629.358,"In terms of consent to create, I would submit that the whole goal of consent to create is to create a learning organization, one looks at itself, this rigorous, critical Self- analysis into activities.",89,,
416,0.97,4629.358,4642.27,"When you look at the consent to create, it's really about policy training and review and then assessments of all this criteria.",89,,
417,0.97,4642.27,4643.805,I see this as the next evolution.,89,,
418,0.97,4643.805,4654.383,I think this is beyond consents to create none of this is required by it.,89,,
419,0.97,4654.383,4660.956,"Certainly, the Analytics platform was part of it that gave us the building blocks, but where we are taking it with this, this will certainly support our efforts in consent to create.",89,,
420,0.97,4660.956,4692.521,"It will show that we're continuing the momentum that was generated by the consent to create, but this is the beyond, and where we go with this and as we continue to develop this in the future, you know, certainly, we are doing this openly, and it is our understanding that our accountability partners will eventually be the backstop to the work we're doing to ensure that we're continuing down the right path, but this I think is just demonstrating the Department's commitment to Iterative improvement and reform and evolution.",89,,
421,0.97,4692.521,4699.127,"Thank you here to correct for the record, I have been reminded that I was incorrect.",90,,
422,0.97,4699.127,4704.866,It was not the Eap that the monitor weighed in on.,90,,
423,0.97,4704.866,4713.175,"It was the Dap, the data Analytics platform.",90,,
424,0.97,4713.175,4745.207,"But Nevertheless, we have listened and made several of the technology investments and really appreciate that we're going to have continued conversations about the application and how it will impact our commitments to equity, accountability, and quality.",90,,
425,0.97,4745.207,4745.607,Got it.,90,,
426,0.97,4745.607,4751.947,Any other questions from Councilmembers?,90,,
427,0.97,4751.947,4757.085,Councilmember Nelson?,90,,
428,0.97,4757.085,4758.887,Thank you very much for this presentation.,91,,
429,0.97,4758.887,4787.816,"I was reading the strategic plan, thinking we were going to get into it in depth, and in the executive summary, it is noted that between 2020 and November 2021, SPD has seen over 325 officers leave the Department . It is on page 4.",91,,
430,0.97,4787.816,4794.422,"Agosta stayed in the face of the stepping constraints, the Department has identified new approaches to recruit and maintain retention of qualified officers, et cetera, and that it goes on and talks.",91,,
431,0.97,4794.422,4806.601,"There are several bullet points in, you know, the initiatives, and one of them is launched direct recruitment strategy to maintain record levels of diversity and quality in hiring.",91,,
432,0.97,4806.601,4825.654,"We noticed that in the introduction, but my question is around incentives . Mayor Durkan ordered hiring and retention incentives . that is no longer on the table.",91,,
433,0.97,4825.654,4837.165,"What I want to know from your professional perspective is due those, do those kinds of incentives work?",91,,
434,0.97,4837.165,4839.434,What can you tell me about that here or Mac elsewhere?,91,,
435,0.97,4839.434,4842.37,"Yeah, you know, there's been a lot of research in regards to retentions.",92,,
436,0.97,4842.37,4845.774,I don't think anybody has seen like what we have seen over the last couple of years.,92,,
437,0.97,4845.774,4847.008,Most agencies are struggling with hiring.,92,,
438,0.97,4847.008,4850.512,We are all trying to look at the same candidate for when.,92,,
439,0.97,4850.512,4874.035,"When I started looking at 2016 data on lateral testing, we have 95 applicants that tested in 2016, and that it was consistent around 60 and 68 and 57, so over the years, it's been a little more consistent, and in 2020, we saw a Drop-Down of 30.",92,,
440,0.97,4874.035,4901.663,"So a third of the total applicants, and we're seeing that even when it comes to the basic law enforcement hiring, where we're actually seeing a much smaller amount of population that is looking to become police officers, and one of the struggles that we have is when you have other cities that are offering incentives, so anything from Tacoma, you're trying to create a level playing field.",92,,
441,0.97,4901.663,4914.309,"You're trying to, out of some opportunities, what makes people come to different agencies . You start to think about some people, some agencies have Take-Home vehicles.",92,,
442,0.97,4914.309,4922.517,King County sheriffs is one of those.,92,,
443,0.97,4922.517,4922.984,Pierce County also.,92,,
444,0.97,4922.984,4929.524,"Snohomish County is also an agency, so those are agencies that have something that we don't have . You look at training.",92,,
445,0.97,4929.524,4935.697,"We do have some of the best training in the country, and that is a benefit to us.",92,,
446,0.97,4935.697,4939.0,Probably better training than any local agency around.,92,,
447,0.97,4939.0,4940.035,That's a good thing.,92,,
448,0.97,4940.035,4955.417,"When you start to look at pay and incentives and just the ability to feel like people feel like they are valued in the job, that is one of the struggles we have experienced over the last couple of years.",92,,
449,0.97,4955.417,4971.533,"We know that morale can be low when they are not appreciated, so we really spent a lot of time also as well on trying to find a schedule in our shift that actually gets people the wellness that they need, the time off that they need, ability to recover and recoup.",92,,
450,0.97,4971.533,4993.188,"We're also working two or three shifts extra a week, and so when I look at the lateral testing in 2022, we've had 23 people test in 2022. of that, the first test in January, we had 17, then in March we only had six people sign up.",92,,
451,0.97,4993.188,5033.094,"We know that in January, that was kind of at the height when we started announcing incentives, and then in March, those incentives had gone away, so we did see a drastic drop in the amount of people just signing up to the testing process . in March of that March test, we only had one that actually finished out the oral board, so if we're looking at trying to hire people and find good quality candidates, having more lateral is going to be --",92,,
452,0.97,5033.328,5049.411,"So you are making it a direct correlation, but was the executive order but was there an Uptick in interest?",93,,
453,0.97,5049.411,5058.386,"In January we had our highest Sign-Up since 2020 and then in March, we dropped drastically down.",94,,
454,0.97,5058.386,5060.688,To just six people signing up.,94,,
455,0.97,5060.688,5064.659,"Okay, thank you.",95,,
456,0.97,5064.659,5085.68,"I appreciate, as well, the conversations that you and I have had around how to fashion an incentive program to be more focused on what makes it more desirable for lateral hires.",95,,
457,0.97,5085.68,5107.869,"From, perhaps, from jurisdictions where officers have less of a pay scale that allows them to actually save money to fund the high cost of relocating to a city like Seattle.",95,,
458,0.97,5107.869,5114.209,Whereas our salaries are very competitive.,95,,
459,0.97,5114.209,5120.515,"That does not help somebody when they need to have resources to pay for first, last, security.",95,,
460,0.97,5120.515,5127.522,"Their uniforms, equipment, that they are not actually compensated for.",95,,
461,0.97,5127.522,5133.094,"A lot of the costs associated with becoming a police officer, here in Seattle.",95,,
462,0.97,5133.094,5142.237,So I really appreciate the Re- centering of your proposal for an incentive program towards relocation.,95,,
463,0.97,5142.237,5152.413,"I think we might be seeing something similar for that, perhaps for other departments.",95,,
464,0.97,5152.413,5157.819,"We have asked for a study, a report, from the executive to look at the needs of all departments.",95,,
465,0.97,5157.819,5174.936,"They also want to flag the conversations that we have also had around her attention and the legislation that was recently passed in the state Legislature, regarding the police Department pension program.",95,,
466,0.97,5174.936,5203.798,"And some reforms that were done to make the pension program more solvent, but that might have the consequence of encouraging officers to retire early and I appreciate that there might be some kind of counter incentives that we might want to consider, to sort of balance out the incentive created by that new, state legislation.",95,,
467,0.97,5203.798,5207.669,"To keep good officers, with experience, here.",95,,
468,0.97,5207.669,5210.705,"This is really important, I think.",95,,
469,0.97,5210.705,5235.463,"When you look at our specialty units, which often our specialty units are full of positions that are held by detectives who have been around for a longer period of time and right now we are seeing those numbers, still, very low, in each of our specialty units.",95,,
470,0.97,5235.463,5237.231,Things like domestic violence.,95,,
471,0.97,5237.231,5240.768,Elder abuse.,95,,
472,0.97,5240.768,5262.29,"And some of the other really important, both prevention and victim support work that is necessary, that is held by detectives who have been with the Department for a longer period of time.",95,,
473,0.97,5262.29,5265.293,"Yes and we have done some advertising, to that point, Councilmember.",96,,
474,0.97,5265.293,5287.682,"Not only are we hitting local advertisement and a lot of various ethnic and community newspapers, but we are focused on finding areas throughout the country, such as Georgia and some of the cities in the South and Midwest, that have a lower pay structure.",96,,
475,0.97,5287.682,5292.353,That also make it a better opportunity.,96,,
476,0.97,5292.353,5301.095,"Because being a large Department in a major city, we do have a variety of different specialty units that people do look to eventually work to achieve.",96,,
477,0.97,5301.095,5305.366,Having its own dedicated Homicide.,96,,
478,0.97,5305.366,5306.367,Having its own harbor unit.,96,,
479,0.97,5306.367,5307.502,Having a S.W.A.T.,96,,
480,0.97,5307.502,5310.838,Team.,96,,
481,0.97,5310.838,5325.253,"Having a variety of different units that do make this an attractive Department, so we are looking at different agencies that have a much lower pay structure and we also want to make sure we are hiring the right officers, too.",96,,
482,0.97,5325.253,5334.796,"When we do look in these areas, we do see a mix of diverse communities in these areas.",96,,
483,0.97,5334.796,5339.701,That is a good population that we continue to get new hires for.,96,,
484,0.97,5339.701,5344.372,"In fact, I just swore in somebody from mobile, Alabama.",96,,
485,0.97,5344.372,5349.844,"It just happened that his wife had been transferred to work for Starbucks, so we were able to hire him as well.",96,,
486,0.97,5349.844,5371.966,"And what is the lead time for lateral transfers, compared to a new hire, as far as the reduction, significant reduction in training?",97,,
487,0.97,5371.966,5375.837,"I know there is still Seattle specific training that is necessary, but can you talk a little bit about that?",97,,
488,0.97,5375.837,5378.473,Our lateral Academy is roughly three weeks long.,98,,
489,0.97,5378.473,5381.109,Because they have already gone through in Academy in their state.,98,,
490,0.97,5381.109,5387.415,Then they do a component where they are learning Seattle specific work.,98,,
491,0.97,5387.415,5397.158,"That usually runs about a month, so you are looking at about a month and a half of Non- ability to deploy.",98,,
492,0.97,5397.158,5403.664,Then that still runs the course of several months.,98,,
493,0.97,5403.664,5408.936,But you're looking at a lateral applicant dropping off about 6 to 9 months worth of training time.,98,,
494,0.97,5408.936,5419.113,"So that training and deployment time is huge, plus you are getting somebody with a lot of experience.",98,,
495,0.97,5419.113,5435.43,"We have actually had people with experience in Detroit that have worked in a detective unit and now that they are in our Department, they have already moved to detective unit and are already making amazing arrests, amazing cases.",98,,
496,0.97,5435.43,5440.635,"So, having that experience has been invaluable.",98,,
497,0.97,5440.635,5441.035,Great.,99,,
498,0.97,5441.035,5447.375,I think there is a lot of good reason to focus on lateral hires and recruitment.,99,,
499,0.97,5447.375,5460.354,"Before we close this line, not ending this conversation, but as far as the issues around hiring, we are just wondering.",99,,
500,0.97,5460.354,5467.228,"Could you speak--you may have already covered this and if so, just restated.",99,,
501,0.97,5467.228,5478.406,"Are there trends in recruitment as it relates to the balance or the number of new recruits, versus Laterals?",99,,
502,0.97,5478.406,5485.112,That either have remained currently or have reversed?,99,,
503,0.97,5485.112,5491.018,"You know, before 2020, bringing in more new recruits than Laterals?",99,,
504,0.97,5491.018,5496.09,And that has flipped?,99,,
505,0.97,5496.09,5497.892,Or is it still the same basic proportion?,99,,
506,0.97,5497.892,5503.397,It is still the same basic proportion.,100,,
507,0.97,5503.397,5506.601,The majority of people we are bringing in our from basic law enforcement.,100,,
508,0.97,5506.601,5514.775,"In fact, we have seen the numbers drastically drop in the lateral applicants, as well as actually finishing the process.",100,,
509,0.97,5514.775,5548.276,"The good thing is, we have done a pretty good job of doing a thorough background and some of the people that applied in 2021 that were lateral applicants, our background detectives have done a lot of making sure that we don't hire somebody else's problem and actually we have been able to ensure that we weeded out people who have had less than stellar careers and that are just looking to switch over because they caused a problem in the city.",100,,
510,0.97,5548.276,5552.747,"Those are things we are going to continue to do, that we do not relax those standards.",100,,
511,0.97,5552.747,5563.324,"We want to make sure that we up the amount of people that are in the lateral process, but we are not going to relax the standards.",100,,
512,0.97,5563.324,5565.259,We don't want to inherit somebody else's problem.,100,,
513,0.97,5565.259,5568.162,Thank you.,101,,
514,0.97,5568.162,5570.231,All right.,101,,
515,0.97,5570.231,5573.668,Councilmember Pedersen.,101,,
516,0.97,5573.668,5575.937,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",102,,
517,0.97,5575.937,5586.881,Thank you for acknowledging the recent violent crimes and that is consistent with the year-end crime report.,102,,
518,0.97,5586.881,5589.684,"Violent crimes, property crimes have increased.",102,,
519,0.97,5589.684,5594.388,"Regarding the strategic plan, I want to make sure I understand how it will be used.",102,,
520,0.97,5594.388,5598.259,As I understand it is only 29 pages.,102,,
521,0.97,5598.259,5608.402,"It is more of a high-level, visionary document, rather than an implementation plan with details on how to reduce crime.",102,,
522,0.97,5608.402,5608.803,Is that correct?,102,,
523,0.97,5608.803,5609.837,That is correct.,103,,
524,0.97,5609.837,5610.104,Okay.,104,,
525,0.97,5610.104,5619.38,So I appreciate Councilmember Nelson's questions and chair Herbold's follow-up on recruitment and retention.,104,,
526,0.97,5619.38,5625.486,"I know a lot of us are focused on that, with 300 officers having left the Department.",104,,
527,0.97,5625.486,5639.9,I wanted to ask about page 10 in the community collaboration section where it says SPD expects every member of its force to work to restore and strengthen community relations.,104,,
528,0.97,5639.9,5653.814,"With community policing officers reassigned to patrol, due to the severe reduction in staff, what are some specific ways SPD officers can work on community relations?",104,,
529,0.97,5653.814,5657.785,A couple of areas where we are focused.,105,,
530,0.97,5657.785,5664.959,We started with the relational policing model training and it is going to focus on outward mindset.,105,,
531,0.97,5664.959,5666.927,Which is really on problem solving.,105,,
532,0.97,5666.927,5677.471,"What we are trying to Re-Shift, because we don't have as many specialty units, is really making every officer a generalist.",105,,
533,0.97,5677.471,5684.311,Being able to be good at building relationships and community.,105,,
534,0.97,5684.311,5687.815,Problem solving and also being able to have the skill set to handle an active shooter situation.,105,,
535,0.97,5687.815,5694.355,So we are already starting to implement the training as part of our relational policing model.,105,,
536,0.97,5694.355,5696.357,That started in 2020.,105,,
537,0.97,5696.357,5697.658,We are also doing outward mindset.,105,,
538,0.97,5697.658,5709.37,"We are actually training all of our supervision, sergeants, lieutenants, and captains, in outward and mindset.",105,,
539,0.97,5709.37,5723.984,"That allows our supervisors to also be able to assess and triage when there is a community problem, to figure out where it needs to be best assigned and how it can be accomplished.",105,,
540,0.97,5723.984,5729.29,I am drastically missing my community policing teams.,105,,
541,0.97,5729.29,5730.891,They really were able to handle a lot.,105,,
542,0.97,5730.891,5735.162,Put out fires before they became big issues.,105,,
543,0.97,5735.162,5737.531,"And not having those, it hurts us quite a bit.",105,,
544,0.97,5737.531,5746.14,It is really having us rethink how we train our officers into more of a generalist mentality.,105,,
545,0.97,5746.14,5757.118,"So you might not see that work on that end until a little bit later in the process, because we still want to make sure --",105,,
546,0.97,5757.118,5757.518,Thank you.,106,,
547,0.97,5757.518,5761.989,I've got a follow-up.,107,,
548,0.97,5761.989,5762.59,"Oh, okay.",108,,
549,0.97,5762.59,5768.462,"Go ahead, Councilmember Pedersen.",108,,
550,0.97,5768.462,5771.365,"I also had a follow-up, but I think maybe you will cover the topic.",108,,
551,0.97,5771.365,5777.204,"It is actually a second question, rather than a Follow- up, so if you want to go first.",109,,
552,0.97,5777.204,5777.805,May I?,110,,
553,0.97,5777.805,5778.239,Yes.,111,,
554,0.97,5778.239,5800.027,"What I thought I understood Councilmember Pedersen to be asking, and I appreciate the answer, but what I thought I heard him asking is how we are going--given that there are only so many officers that we know that we can hire in a year.",112,,
555,0.97,5800.027,5810.104,And we are going to do our best to hit that number.,112,,
556,0.97,5810.104,5822.716,We have a Department that I think is actually 375 fewer officers now than it did in early 2020.,112,,
557,0.97,5822.716,5842.403,But what are we going to do to maybe sort of refocus some of our public safety work towards Nonuniform parts of that apartment?,112,,
558,0.97,5842.403,5844.838,That is what I am hearing from a lot of community members.,112,,
559,0.97,5844.838,5854.615,"People are starting to understand that we have funded the Department for as many officers as you can hire, but it is not enough.",112,,
560,0.97,5854.615,5872.9,"Because we need to be doing something different to activate the staff that we have or to increase the staffing for Nonuniform folks who are focused on public safety, like the cs owes.",112,,
561,0.97,5872.9,5877.137,That is a good point.,113,,
562,0.97,5877.137,5889.783,"We are in discussions and I don't want to get too far ahead of us, but how we are deploying Csos and how we support their level of work.",113,,
563,0.97,5889.783,5895.356,"Our crime prevention Coordinators are typically on the Front-End, doing prevention work.",113,,
564,0.97,5895.356,5900.928,And Csos is on follow-up and doing different engagement.,113,,
565,0.97,5900.928,5924.885,"We have deployed a couple of the Csos, in conjunction with a hybrid model, where we have three officers and two Csos to engage community and also be able to support that effort that we are working to maintain that site.",113,,
566,0.97,5924.885,5926.921,Rather than moving all of our resources to third and pine.,113,,
567,0.97,5926.921,5931.692,This allows us to still have a visible presence.,113,,
568,0.97,5931.692,5935.029,So that is already starting.,113,,
569,0.97,5935.029,5939.9,We are already starting to make those efforts now.,113,,
570,0.97,5939.9,5962.256,"As we build the program out and have more Csos to be able to do that, obviously it will be able to start hitting different areas and also be able to look at even third and pine is being another location where we would have that level of support as well, for a Non-Sworn presence, as well.",113,,
571,0.97,5962.256,5980.741,"Sort of related to that before we go back to Councilmember Pedersen, can you talk a little bit about the Analytical work related to the 911 call analysis that will, again, this is not within the context of Reimagining policing.",114,,
572,0.97,5980.741,5982.376,And the racial reckoning of George Floyd's murder.,114,,
573,0.97,5982.376,5988.248,"This is also so important, given our staffing challenges.",114,,
574,0.97,5988.248,6003.497,"And the work to identify the types of 911 calls that we don't need to be sending sworn police too, so that we can make sure that we have sworn police to answer the calls that only they can make.",114,,
575,0.97,6003.497,6006.4,I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about that project.,114,,
576,0.97,6006.4,6012.84,I will turn it over to CLO Maxey.,115,,
577,0.97,6012.84,6020.948,"There is a risk assessment that is going to be conducted, but I will leave it to you.",115,,
578,0.97,6020.948,6025.319,This is the project being undertaken right now.,116,,
579,0.97,6025.319,6028.455,"Again, this is using adapt, using 911 call data.",116,,
580,0.97,6028.455,6035.796,Really what it is doing is creating a risk index for each call and looking at what did the call started as?,116,,
581,0.97,6035.796,6042.069,"How did it end as, to see if we can identify the type of the call that it actually is.",116,,
582,0.97,6042.069,6052.312,"It is using all of the available Analytics to categorize these calls, based on our best understanding.",116,,
583,0.97,6052.312,6057.518,This will be supported by dispatcher protocols on how to tease out the proper information about the call.,116,,
584,0.97,6057.518,6075.602,"In the end, once this analysis is complete, this will give a Categorization of the calls, as to whether there will be death, serious injury, minimal injury, or property damage stemming from any individual call, which will help us assess the risk.",116,,
585,0.97,6075.602,6083.51,So this is the responsible way to determine which calls could be served by an unarmed Responder.,116,,
586,0.97,6083.51,6084.745,We are still working on this.,116,,
587,0.97,6084.745,6094.888,I think we will report out to this Committee at the end of the first quarter on where exactly we are and a lot more breadth of detail.,116,,
588,0.97,6094.888,6115.209,"One more thing I did want to sort of level set is looking at the calls and looking at the direction we are going with this, I think this is more that it is not currently being served than it is supplanting the current officers.",116,,
589,0.97,6115.209,6120.481,There are things that officers are simply not going to at this point.,116,,
590,0.97,6120.481,6125.552,Those are the calls that will be filled by this alternative response.,116,,
591,0.97,6125.552,6127.354,That is a helpful distinction.,117,,
592,0.97,6127.354,6131.658,Councilmember Pedersen.,117,,
593,0.97,6131.658,6132.259,Thank you.,118,,
594,0.97,6132.259,6132.459,Yes.,118,,
595,0.97,6132.459,6136.53,I appreciate talking about these alternative responses.,118,,
596,0.97,6136.53,6140.0,"For the viewing public, you know the crime prevention goes beyond the police Department.",118,,
597,0.97,6140.0,6155.649,"I had a meeting recently with neighborhood business district leaders who are seeking to have a position that also has cross departmental authority to link people to services, as well as to call upon the police Department as needed.",118,,
598,0.97,6155.649,6172.266,"As we attempt to restore the officers that left, also looking at new models positioned to link to other city departments in the field, especially in those neighborhoods.",118,,
599,0.97,6172.266,6175.736,This is districts where we are seeing a spike in crime.,118,,
600,0.97,6175.736,6184.077,"My last question about the strategic plan, on page 22 it talks about wellness.",118,,
601,0.97,6184.077,6191.385,"I know that officer Harris, honored in the strategic plan, who was killed on I-5, that was important to her as well.",118,,
602,0.97,6191.385,6200.127,"Where are you looking for best practices on officer wellness and what can we, as a committee, do to help?",118,,
603,0.97,6200.127,6211.572,"So, we were actually awarded and assistance where we can get expertise from across the country.",119,,
604,0.97,6211.572,6222.849,We had Indianapolis and San Diego being able to assess some of our programs.,119,,
605,0.97,6222.849,6226.72,"We have 70 Pierce support volunteers throughout the Department, including all precincts and all watches.",119,,
606,0.97,6226.72,6245.606,"We also have mental health professionals on contract and we are deploying them at the various precincts, including the East and West precincts, which have seen probably the most activity.",119,,
607,0.97,6245.606,6247.04,As far as demonstrations from years ago.,119,,
608,0.97,6247.04,6260.454,"But we want to make sure that we assign them in each of our precincts of the get to know each other, build a relationship and see the very early Onset, where there can potentially be a decline in an officer's performance.",119,,
609,0.97,6260.454,6265.726,We are also doing that work.,119,,
610,0.97,6265.726,6270.397,"Four officers were veterans, they provide benefits and services.",119,,
611,0.97,6270.397,6273.8,One of the things is also making sure you maintain just being physically healthy.,119,,
612,0.97,6273.8,6279.94,We have a tactical athlete program.,119,,
613,0.97,6279.94,6286.647,It actually provides nutrition assistance as well.,119,,
614,0.97,6286.647,6297.824,"The other things we are looking at also doing his leadership training, so we have been working on bringing in different professional speakers for the Department.",119,,
615,0.97,6297.824,6300.26,We have different Apps because of the nature of our work.,119,,
616,0.97,6300.26,6302.629,"We have a protocol App, which is a wellness App.",119,,
617,0.97,6302.629,6312.239,It provides different contacts and different ability for people to reach out.,119,,
618,0.97,6312.239,6313.273,We have a mentor program.,119,,
619,0.97,6313.273,6315.809,That was very important for me when I came onto the Department.,119,,
620,0.97,6315.809,6322.382,Having someone we could ask questions to and guidance.,119,,
621,0.97,6322.382,6328.488,To guide them through their first year of the Department.,119,,
622,0.97,6328.488,6338.465,One of our personnel that is certified to run our alcohol and substance abuse program.,119,,
623,0.97,6338.465,6342.469,"We know when our officers find ourselves not in a good place, sometimes alcohol can be a contributing factor.",119,,
624,0.97,6342.469,6357.417,"We want to make sure that we are doing a lot of work on the prevention side, so we can make sure officers are getting potential treatment, should they be going down the wrong road.",119,,
625,0.97,6357.417,6367.294,"One of the cooler things we are doing, we have facility dogs that we are now bringing in.",119,,
626,0.97,6367.294,6368.095,We received a donation.,119,,
627,0.97,6368.095,6377.037,"We have three facility emotional support dogs coming this spring, from vet dogs.",119,,
628,0.97,6377.037,6391.251,"You know, these type of dogs have been deployed in a variety of different situations and mass casualty situations and situations where there is a huge disturbance or critical incident, that if it goes on in the community.",119,,
629,0.97,6391.251,6399.593,These dogs know when somebody is feeling sad and having a certain level of emotion.,119,,
630,0.97,6399.593,6405.665,They come right up to the person and we have deployed them.,119,,
631,0.97,6405.665,6409.136,We have actually deployed them in a variety of other situations.,119,,
632,0.97,6409.136,6421.882,"So having these trained dogs to be able to support, and they will be available for critical incidents, officer involved shootings, riots, et cetera, and a variety of different needs.",119,,
633,0.97,6421.882,6434.127,I think this will be critical for our officers to be able to have those dogs be part of their livelihood.,119,,
634,0.97,6434.127,6445.505,"Thanks so much and I think it is really important to note that when we talk about retention, a lot of retention policies are also wellness policies.",120,,
635,0.97,6445.505,6458.652,"I mentioned earlier and I think it is really good to think of that as fulfilling to, important, dual purposes.",120,,
636,0.97,6458.652,6459.719,Thank you.,120,,
637,0.97,6459.719,6466.426,Councilmember Mosqueda.,120,,
638,0.97,6466.426,6468.061,"Thank you very much, Madam chair.",121,,
639,0.97,6468.061,6471.064,I would like to continue with the theme you brought up around retention.,121,,
640,0.97,6471.064,6476.169,I think it gets lost sometimes.,121,,
641,0.97,6476.169,6484.311,"What we heard directly from officers, officers in Seattle and also across this country have been saying they cannot be mental health providers.",121,,
642,0.97,6484.311,6486.98,They cannot be housing Connectors.,121,,
643,0.97,6486.98,6508.034,"They cannot be crisis management responders when they are not social workers and it is because of the direct feedback we received from officers that there has been a direct effort to try to make sure, as Councilmember Herbold noted, that calls do not require an officer with a gun to show up, go to someone else.",121,,
644,0.97,6508.034,6513.34,That is what we have been actively funding and trying to move towards.,121,,
645,0.97,6513.34,6516.91,I know you spent a lot of time and Councilmember spent a lot of time talking about recruitment.,121,,
646,0.97,6516.91,6520.247,We have done recruitment bonuses in the past.,121,,
647,0.97,6520.247,6538.798,"We have not seen a change in recruitment strategies and the conversation the Council and larger public is having around how we offload some of these jobs that are not necessary for officers to respond to, will be a very important element of retention strategies.",121,,
648,0.97,6538.798,6540.333,"I, too, have extended family members who are officers.",121,,
649,0.97,6540.333,6547.307,I'm sympathetic to their concerns about not wanting to be case managers and mental health counselors.,121,,
650,0.97,6547.307,6555.382,I want to make sure we continue to underscore why we are interested in moving some of the strategies.,121,,
651,0.97,6555.382,6556.783,It will also help with retention.,121,,
652,0.97,6556.783,6573.733,"I also want to make sure we are having a conversation about the data Analytics and you mentioned the conversation we are looking at, in terms of what the alternative is.",121,,
653,0.97,6573.733,6579.706,"The alternate response could be based on officer interactions, but I would like to know if there is an outside party helping with that analysis.",121,,
654,0.97,6579.706,6602.162,"For example, I think in some cases the fact that an officer showed up to some of these calls with a badge and a gun, versus a mental health counselor with the training and skills to De- escalate, using mental health counseling strategies or engagement strategies that a case manager might be equipped to have, there is a different outcome.",121,,
655,0.97,6602.162,6614.007,"For example if you looked at the Lyles case and the analysis of the interaction was that yes, an officer was needed, because there ended up needing to be an interaction.",121,,
656,0.97,6614.007,6632.192,"The outcome could have been completely different if a mental health provider had showed up to that case, so I am very interested and wondering if we can have that analysis done with an outside party to look at the type of situations that you are evaluating with the 911 call services.",121,,
657,0.97,6632.192,6634.594,"Because the outcome would be, potentially, completely different.",121,,
658,0.97,6634.594,6644.137,"Again, for the individual who was on the pier and had a knife and was immediately shot.",121,,
659,0.97,6644.137,6649.042,"I would very much like to have a conversation about analyzing that with an outside party, as well.",121,,
660,0.97,6649.042,6655.915,"And if I may, I do have two questions related to the strategic plan.",121,,
661,0.97,6655.915,6658.184,"On page 12, there is a conversation in the strategic plan.",121,,
662,0.97,6658.184,6669.729,"It says, quote, focus on collaboration with courts, jails, and service providers to find better jurisdictions for repeat--again, this is with interactions with the community.",121,,
663,0.97,6669.729,6678.304,"On this bullet as it relates to the operation new day and Shoplifting, we talked a lot about this last time.",121,,
664,0.97,6678.304,6684.778,Very sympathetic to smaller shops who are seeing higher rates of theft and vandalism.,121,,
665,0.97,6684.778,6691.484,I also have continued concerns about the presence of officers.,121,,
666,0.97,6691.484,6703.496,Some officers in larger chains who are interacting with individuals who they may be engaged in Shoplifting.,121,,
667,0.97,6703.496,6713.406,"An example is on Friday, February 11, SPD stationed a plainclothes officer in the downtown target and arrested Shoplifters.",121,,
668,0.97,6713.406,6717.677,All five booked that day were indigenous and represented by public defenders.,121,,
669,0.97,6717.677,6719.512,One was initially too sick to come to court.,121,,
670,0.97,6719.512,6731.324,Another was charged with $6.99 of merchandise and is now in competency proceedings because of their inability to understand the charge against him and assist in their defense.,121,,
671,0.97,6731.324,6741.468,"Another had a delay because of a lack of interpreter and chose to go forward without an interpreter, because the court failed to provide one at the second scheduled Arraignment.",121,,
672,0.97,6741.468,6753.713,"I am wondering if you have any information for us on the demographics of the individuals arrested with operation new day, given the short staffing that you cited.",121,,
673,0.97,6753.713,6757.884,Despite the city council fully funding the hiring plan.,121,,
674,0.97,6757.884,6766.426,I am wondering how much these operations are costing in terms of time and capacity.,121,,
675,0.97,6766.426,6775.168,And I will also ask about whether or not on page 25 you can help me understand the difference between a Terry stop and a stop and Frisk.,121,,
676,0.97,6775.168,6777.337,It is actually case law.,122,,
677,0.97,6777.337,6783.51,It is Terry versus Ohio.,122,,
678,0.97,6783.51,6784.31,Basically reasonable suspicion.,122,,
679,0.97,6784.31,6797.09,Stop and Frisk is something that was created in New York and it is less grounded in legal and constitutional law.,122,,
680,0.97,6797.09,6804.831,"So, we do all of our work based on Terry versus Ohio.",122,,
681,0.97,6804.831,6815.408,We base our stops on reasonable suspicion stops grounded in constitutional law and not on a stop and Frisk.,122,,
682,0.97,6815.408,6823.716,"One of the cases you brought up on the $6.99, actually they have assaulted one of the staff.",122,,
683,0.97,6823.716,6829.389,"At that time we have not booked them under the case number, because we could not locate the case number.",122,,
684,0.97,6829.389,6835.895,"We were able to do that, we put a supplemental report, and ended up having charges for assault on that case.",122,,
685,0.97,6835.895,6840.166,"We have been doing Triaging of a lot of cases, so we are not trying to book them.",122,,
686,0.97,6840.166,6844.037,Trying to issue out warnings.,122,,
687,0.97,6844.037,6851.411,"However, when there are situations that there are multiple charges, then we are at those times making certain arrests.",122,,
688,0.97,6851.411,6859.853,We can get to some of the demographic data or we can work to get some of the demographic data to you as well.,122,,
689,0.97,6859.853,6869.963,"I do want to confirm, since it came up in a previous committee meeting.",123,,
690,0.97,6869.963,6877.136,"The question around the relatively minor target, Shoplifting.",123,,
691,0.97,6877.136,6895.221,"That even though the report that had been attached to some circulation in the public around this case, not include reference to the assault on a target employee.",123,,
692,0.97,6895.221,6901.027,"Where she struck the employee with a bottle, multiple times.",123,,
693,0.97,6901.027,6902.095,It was documented.,123,,
694,0.97,6902.095,6911.271,The assault was documented under a different report.,123,,
695,0.97,6911.271,6920.346,"And the theft, the victim, the store employee, did not have the incident number for the assault.",123,,
696,0.97,6920.346,6926.085,To use.,123,,
697,0.97,6926.085,6935.261,"And apparently there is a follow-up report that was generated, requesting targeted assault on the individual.",123,,
698,0.97,6935.261,6939.699,So I just want to flag that.,123,,
699,0.97,6939.699,6942.835,This is something that we did look into.,123,,
700,0.97,6942.835,6951.277,It was brought up in public comment in a previous committee meeting.,123,,
701,0.97,6951.277,6951.878,But I do agree.,123,,
702,0.97,6951.878,6966.726,We have asked for and received demographic information as it relates to city attorneys.,123,,
703,0.97,6966.726,6969.862,We received that demographic information and it will be very helpful.,123,,
704,0.97,6969.862,6992.018,"I understand that there was a plan for weekly reporting on operation new day and hopefully it addresses the demographic composition of folks arrested, as well.",123,,
705,0.97,6992.018,6994.754,Councilmember Nelson.,123,,
706,0.97,6994.754,7000.66,I agree that retention is important.,124,,
707,0.97,7000.66,7016.509,"It is the biggest bang for the buck to keep the officers we have and if there is an incentive program, it is best, you know, we should reward people we already have for doing the work that they are doing.",124,,
708,0.97,7016.509,7018.945,"That has to be bargained, so that is a different story.",124,,
709,0.97,7018.945,7025.618,"To Councilmember Mosqueda's point, I agree.",124,,
710,0.97,7025.618,7034.427,We need to make sure the right people are going out on these calls and SPD does have crisis response teams that have social workers in them.,124,,
711,0.97,7034.427,7040.033,"I don't know how many of these units exist, but that is a model that has proven to be effective and it is similar to the fire Department.",124,,
712,0.97,7040.033,7041.934,Where Emts go out with social workers.,124,,
713,0.97,7041.934,7062.455,"I like that approach and until we have triage one set up, so there is a place for these calls to go that does not require a uniformed police response, we need to focus on combining specialties in these call responses.",124,,
714,0.97,7062.455,7070.863,"So, thank you very much for bringing that up.",124,,
715,0.97,7076.069,7076.702,Sorry about that.,125,,
716,0.97,7076.702,7081.007,And I think Councilmember Pedersen had another question along time ago.,126,,
717,0.97,7081.007,7084.243,I don't want to jump in.,126,,
718,0.97,7084.243,7088.481,"I was just going to return back to that, thank you so much.",127,,
719,0.97,7088.481,7088.981,Councilmember Pedersen.,127,,
720,0.97,7088.981,7097.19,"I was able to ask all my questions and you asked my recruitment and retention questions, so thank you.",128,,
721,0.97,7097.19,7098.024,Perfect.,129,,
722,0.97,7098.024,7108.401,Any other thoughts that we would like to cover on the topic of the strategic plan?,129,,
723,0.97,7108.401,7127.487,"I just want to note, that I appreciate that in 2020 the Seattle police Department Blotter was expanded to add a report on daily significant incident reports.",129,,
724,0.97,7127.487,7138.064,Providing command staff and rapid notification events of potential cross precinct issues.,129,,
725,0.97,7138.064,7147.807,To make specific information about specific events directly available to officers.,129,,
726,0.97,7147.807,7152.245,"As I understand it, reports are available to the public.",129,,
727,0.97,7152.245,7166.893,"I think it is good practice in order to enhance communication for the Department, as well as informing the public.",129,,
728,0.97,7166.893,7171.764,Often the eyes and ears to the Department of emerging issues.,129,,
729,0.97,7171.764,7177.436,So I just wanted to flag that.,129,,
730,0.97,7177.436,7182.542,It looks like we might be about to close out here.,129,,
731,0.97,7182.542,7183.342,"Well, thank you.",130,,
732,0.97,7183.342,7186.812,Thank you everyone for the questions and discussion.,130,,
733,0.97,7186.812,7191.284,We want to make sure we are moving the Department in the right direction.,130,,
734,0.97,7191.284,7196.255,"So as I noted in the executive summary, this is really not a closed document.",130,,
735,0.97,7196.255,7206.532,It really is based on a lot of feedback and continued feedback for us to move the Department.,130,,
736,0.97,7206.532,7221.013,"Thank you and even though we did not do a deep dive into the issue, we do want to, again, as I do often recognize and flag the amazing work that apartment is doing, getting guns off the streets.",131,,
737,0.97,7221.013,7232.391,"Just really, unfortunately, there are significant increases in guns and you are doing a great job making sure the folks who should not have them, do not.",131,,
738,0.97,7232.391,7233.559,Thank you.,132,,
739,0.97,7233.559,7241.1,Thank you.,132,,
740,0.97,7241.1,7242.134,"All right, be well.",133,,
741,0.97,7242.134,7245.571,"Thank you and let's move on to the last item on the agenda, agenda item number four.",133,,
742,0.97,7245.571,7246.806,Committee agenda item number four.,134,,
743,0.97,7246.806,7255.748,"Council bill 120280, an ordinance relating to the budget ordinance.",134,,
744,0.97,7255.748,7257.65,Changing appropriations to various departments and budget control levels.,134,,
745,0.97,7257.65,7258.05,Adding Provisos.,134,,
746,0.97,7258.05,7264.49,And ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.,134,,
747,0.97,7264.49,7268.961,"Again, this is an item we discussed at the March 8 meeting of the public safety and human services committee.",135,,
748,0.97,7268.961,7280.973,"Greg Doss is here for a second briefing and as mentioned at the start of the meeting, I do have amendment 1 to Council bill 120280.",135,,
749,0.97,7280.973,7286.012,"Thank you, Madam chair.",136,,
750,0.97,7286.012,7287.213,"Greg Doss, council central staff.",136,,
751,0.97,7287.213,7299.625,"Council bill 120280, as a reminder, would appropriate to the Seattle police Department funding from the Department of homeland security for the grant.",136,,
752,0.97,7299.625,7319.879,"The committee heard on March 8, testimony from the assistant chief and Brian Maxey, who you just heard from, about the purchases they intend to make with the $3.2 million in homeland security Uasi funds.",136,,
753,0.97,7319.879,7331.59,"Additionally, there is a spreadsheet posted to the agenda that details each of the programs and projects that would be highlighted with that funding.",136,,
754,0.97,7331.59,7336.629,"We went over that, the committee did, in depth on March 8. there were a couple of questions that were left outstanding from that meeting.",136,,
755,0.97,7336.629,7346.138,I want to address those now.,136,,
756,0.97,7346.138,7355.881,The first one was from the chair and that was for the Department to identify which of the items on the list would be subject to the city surveillance ordinance.,136,,
757,0.97,7355.881,7367.259,"Of course, they are all subject to the surveillance ordinance, but which ones would most likely trigger the definition of surveillance and require a surveillance impact report?",136,,
758,0.97,7367.259,7371.731,There were four that the Department thought would most likely be categorized as surveillance.,136,,
759,0.97,7371.731,7379.238,The first was Cybersecurity software that the center is going to purchase.,136,,
760,0.97,7379.238,7384.477,Another was the long radar system that was going to be purchased.,136,,
761,0.97,7384.477,7391.65,"Third, the Binocular night vision system and enhanced thermal Imager.",136,,
762,0.97,7391.65,7396.255,The last is the Digital x-ray system.,136,,
763,0.97,7396.255,7404.029,I think that is the one we talked about at length.,136,,
764,0.97,7404.029,7406.999,"Those four would require surveillance impact reports, most likely.",136,,
765,0.97,7406.999,7419.445,"The second question that was asked, whether the department had any specific policies that would prohibit the system from being used to track civilians?",136,,
766,0.97,7419.445,7428.421,"As a refresher, that is the system that allows the police Department to track its units during an emergency.",136,,
767,0.97,7428.421,7440.199,"Spd indicated it does not have policies to prohibit that, because the system is only capable of tracking police and not civilians.",136,,
768,0.97,7440.199,7444.236,Those are the only questions on that list.,136,,
769,0.97,7444.236,7448.707,That is the only information I had for you today.,136,,
770,0.97,7448.707,7467.193,"Because there are no amendments that would seek to prohibit or condition the spending in any way that would potentially disrupt the grant, there is not a need to discuss any fiscal matters, relative to Provisos.",136,,
771,0.97,7467.193,7474.3,"So at that point, I think the committee is ready to vote.",136,,
772,0.97,7474.3,7485.11,"And I am able to answer any questions or discuss amendment one, at the chair's discretion.",136,,
773,0.97,7485.11,7502.127,"I just want to fly with the significance of a technology that requires, to the funding that would be authorized under this grant.",137,,
774,0.97,7502.127,7518.944,"The significance is that the surveillance ordinance prohibits any Department from spending funds that require a server, until such time as the Council acts on that.",137,,
775,0.97,7518.944,7524.683,We have identified the Technologies that are likely to require a S.I.R.,137,,
776,0.97,7524.683,7544.203,"And we were hearing both that they were hoping we would act on this grant in a way that allowed them to, as soon as possible, do the purchases, so they could close out the grant.",137,,
777,0.97,7544.203,7547.039,We did ask a finer point on the questions.,137,,
778,0.97,7547.039,7560.185,What do we do when we haven't acted on S.I.R .'s that are required and thus the Department isn't doing spending?,137,,
779,0.97,7560.185,7563.455,We got a great answer from SPD.,137,,
780,0.97,7563.455,7582.408,"They note that again they are making the commitment that any items that include technology that will automatically go under the privacy review and if they are instructed to prepare a S.I.R., they will complete that process before they make the purchase, as required by the surveillance ordinance.",137,,
781,0.97,7582.408,7586.211,They go on to say if the S.I.R.,137,,
782,0.97,7586.211,7595.354,"Is not approved, they will coordinate with the state to request an extension from FEMA and it is not uncommon to ask for contract extension for grants.",137,,
783,0.97,7595.354,7600.859,And that it is up to the Feds.,137,,
784,0.97,7600.859,7604.296,"So, I am satisfied with that response.",137,,
785,0.97,7604.296,7616.008,And I really want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for all of the great questions that she had in committee.,137,,
786,0.97,7616.008,7616.542,Last committee meeting.,137,,
787,0.97,7616.542,7639.665,"It really gave us, I think, an opportunity to learn more and get more in the weeds about this program and how it is not used, as it relates to your general, ordinary, Run-Of-The- mill policing for tactics associated with community safety.",137,,
788,0.97,7639.665,7645.137,They are generally not used in crowd control situations.,137,,
789,0.97,7645.137,7653.445,There is a really targeted focus for most of these grant programs.,137,,
790,0.97,7653.445,7659.351,There are no general questions.,138,,
791,0.97,7659.351,7660.986,"Greg, could you describe the amendment, please?",138,,
792,0.97,7660.986,7662.955,"Yeah, thank you.",139,,
793,0.97,7662.955,7679.638,Amendment one simply establishes that the projects that would be funded with Uasi funds are subject to the surveillance ordinance and the affect statement that I was going to describe.,139,,
794,0.97,7679.638,7681.34,I think you just gave a perfect explanation of.,139,,
795,0.97,7681.34,7684.977,That until such time as the S.I.R.,139,,
796,0.97,7684.977,7688.38,"Is approved, purchases cannot be made.",139,,
797,0.97,7688.38,7699.558,"The department has indicated that if they can't spend the money by the end of the grant, which is December 31, 2023, they will ask for an extension.",139,,
798,0.97,7699.558,7701.96,"Thank you so much, Greg.",140,,
799,0.97,7701.96,7707.9,"The committee agrees, I would love to put the amendment before us.",140,,
800,0.97,7707.9,7714.006,"So, I moved to adopt amendment one to Council bill 120280.",140,,
801,0.97,7714.006,7715.374,Is there a second?,140,,
802,0.97,7715.374,7718.844,Second.,141,,
803,0.97,7718.844,7719.478,Thank you.,142,,
804,0.97,7719.478,7723.348,It has been moved and Seconded.,142,,
805,0.97,7723.348,7727.82,"Recommend passage--I'm sorry, that's not right.",142,,
806,0.97,7727.82,7733.959,It has been moved and Seconded to adopt amendment one to Council bill 120280.,142,,
807,0.97,7733.959,7738.564,"Can we vote on the amendment, please?",142,,

817,0.97,7760.285,7763.489,Are there any comments on the amended bill?,151,,
818,0.97,7763.489,7770.262,Thank you.,151,,
819,0.97,7770.262,7773.499,I move amended Council bill 120280.,151,,
820,0.97,7773.499,7774.733,Is there a second?,151,,
821,0.97,7774.733,7775.501,Second.,152,,
822,0.97,7775.501,7781.64,Okay.,153,,
823,0.97,7781.64,7786.445,"Any amended Council bill 120280, is before us.",153,,
