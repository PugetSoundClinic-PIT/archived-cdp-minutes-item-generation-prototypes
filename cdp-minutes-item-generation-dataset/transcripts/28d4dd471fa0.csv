45,0.97,215.014,232.765,Consistent with that with what our partners at King County have also done so in the next week or so I do intend as Council President to issue a similar directive for the legislative branch that would extend our Telework protocols to be aligned with the extension recently announced by Mayor Durkan.,20,,
46,0.97,232.765,244.377,"With news of a Covid vaccine potentially becoming available in Washington state as early as mid December, it is important to recall we still do not have details about how that will be distributed and who will be Prioritized.",20,,

50,0.97,263.696,291.557,"As for the city Council and our essential workers, should the governor's proclamation regarding the open public meetings act be rescinded or should it expire, I wanted to make sure you were all aware that I've been working closely with city clerk and FAS on reviewing and approving physical modifications to Council chambers such as the installation of Plexiglass in the event we would be required to gather in person in the next year.",20,,
51,0.97,291.557,304.437,"We have also been working with our legislative hr director Karen Jackson to develop recommendations for physical changes in maximum occupancy for offices, conference rooms and other gathering spaces.",20,,

53,0.97,311.11,316.082,"Again, I want to emphasize that this would be an exception to the Telework guidance.",20,,
54,0.97,316.082,328.061,Any potential in office work would be an exception and I want to emphasize that I still continue to strongly recommend that employees of the legislative Department Telework.,20,,
55,0.97,328.061,333.499,I acknowledge there may be an occasional need for staff to come into City Hall.,20,,
56,0.97,333.499,358.591,"The protocols I've been working with director Jackson on will provide all of us guidance in the hopefully rare instance in which Telework is not possible, coupled, again, with many of the physical changes that are happening both in our internal offices and elsewhere on the second and third floor that I've been working on with our city clerk and with folks over with the assistance of folks over at FAS.",20,,
57,0.97,358.591,360.026,More to come on this topic.,20,,
58,0.97,360.026,389.722,I did want to give you an update on these important issues related to workplace safety in this time of Covid-19 and I hope to be able to provide you all these written materials and guidance some time next week Certainl before we go on recess to make sure that we are all ready for whatever the new year 2021 brings to us.,20,,

65,0.97,426.959,435.535,This will be the second and final briefing on this item following their initial presentation of a draft legislative agenda which occurred on November 2ND.,20,,
66,0.97,435.535,446.679,Council members you and your staff have had an opportunity in the last few weeks to meet with the team and to also discuss possible changes to the draft legislative agenda.,20,,
67,0.97,446.679,464.263,Following this briefing I expect that the city council will take final action to adopt this agenda either via resolution on December 7th or December 14th depending on the number of final amendments that need to be Incorported into the draft we're about to discuss this morning.,20,,
68,0.97,464.263,468.668,So let's go ahead and begin with a quick round of introductions.,20,,
69,0.97,468.668,481.314,And I'm going to go ahead scene hand it over to director Wilson- Codega for those presentations and then I think she'll have some opening remarks and we'll go ahead and dig into the presentation.,20,,

71,0.97,483.95,485.818,"Good morning, Council President.",21,,

80,0.97,517.984,519.752,Sounds like some dates are still being worked out.,25,,
81,0.97,519.752,534.467,As long as that happens before the holiday recess we're good to go and I'd first like to thank many of you for taking the time to meet with us to review your specific legislative priorities and for the feedback we've received in the past several weeks.,25,,
82,0.97,534.467,562.495,"Don't panic, although we were not able to incorporate all of the additional language we received later last week and this weekend into the draft before you today as it had already been published rest assured there's time to incorporate those Edits we received later and this weekend I know Quinn will be working to incorporate, excuse me, this week, Quinn will be working to incorporate that additional language we've received from your offices in the final version before it comes before you again.",25,,
83,0.97,562.495,569.101,Just a few highlights I wanted to talk through before I turn it over to Quinn.,25,,
84,0.97,569.101,577.276,As we've discussed previously this upcoming session will be primarily virtual in lights risks posed by the Covid-19 Pandemickic.,25,,
85,0.97,577.276,582.114,There is a chance the governor may call a special session in advance of the regular session in January.,25,,
86,0.97,582.114,586.118,We'll continue to monitor those developments and report back to you all.,25,,
87,0.97,586.118,594.06,"In terms of format today, Quinn will begin with a session overview and budget update for you.",25,,
88,0.97,594.06,599.532,"We'll review education technology, climate, revenue and land use.",25,,
89,0.97,599.532,615.681,"Robin will review the Council's public safety, racial and criminal justice priorities under the safe city section and finally Hannah will review the Council safety net, public health and housing priorities.",25,,
90,0.97,615.681,651.784,"Lastly just one thing I did want to reinforce this year, given the Council's commitment to centering the city's legislative priorities in racial justice, I want to recognize our Department's commitment to advocating for policies that center black, indigenous and people of color, actively challenging institutions that have been used to uphold systems of oppression and ensuring immigrants and refugees have access to economic and legal resources and support, particularly in light of the disproportionate impact the Covid pandemic has had on our communities.",25,,
91,0.97,651.784,652.051,Of color.,25,,
92,0.97,652.051,671.137,A big thank you to the director of the office of civil rights and legislative leaders for their partnership assistance and assistance this interim and I will now turn it over to our state relations director Quinn Majeski.,25,,
93,0.97,671.137,672.304,Thank you.,25,,
94,0.97,672.304,673.372,"Thank you, Lily.",26,,
95,0.97,673.372,687.553,"So just to, before we jump into the legislative agenda just to provide a brief update on the upcoming legislative session we provided an overview last time but there's a few things that we want to keep you apprised of as we move forward.",26,,
96,0.97,687.553,698.264,As Lily mentioned there is the potential still for a special session governor Inslee addressed that potential in a statement to the press last week.,26,,
97,0.97,698.264,711.61,This special session would be focused primarily as best is our understanding on response to Covid-19 and the recent surge in cases throughout King County and the state.,26,,
98,0.97,711.61,727.927,It sounds like it would be pretty tight and they would try to keep it relatively short but we're still gathering information on that so we will be sure to relay any additional updates or news as we receive it to you and your offices.,26,,
99,0.97,727.927,752.751,"The other update that I wanted to provide before we dive into the legislative agenda is that there was a updated revenue forecast released last week and, again, the news is positive from a budgetary standpoint.",26,,
100,0.97,752.751,764.463,"The 2019, 2021 biennial budget which is the budget we're in through June 2021 has seen an increase of just over 600 million in the forecast.",26,,
101,0.97,764.463,775.007,"And the 2021-2023 budget which is the budget that the Legislature will be considering this upcoming legislative session, the forecast has seen an increase there of $328 million.",26,,
102,0.97,775.007,786.919,Those two increases in the forecast combined bring the expected shortfall for the upcoming biennial budget down to 3.3 billion.,26,,
103,0.97,786.919,800.399,"Obviously that is a large number but it's significantly less than the $10 billion which we were, which the forecast showed over the summer and even the $4.6 billion from earlier this fall.",26,,
104,0.97,800.399,804.37,So the budget picture continues to improve.,26,,
105,0.97,804.37,814.38,As I've mentioned previously there is a negative effect there of alleviating some of the pressure on reforms to the progressive revenue system.,26,,
106,0.97,814.38,830.262,That is something we are continuing to monitor and continuing to work with stake holders and others to push for as we know progressive revenue if is a priority for the city of Seattle and you all individually as Council members.,26,,
107,0.97,830.262,832.097,We're working closely on that.,26,,
108,0.97,832.097,837.636,To keep you apprised of the Dynamics as they exist in the Legislature.,26,,
109,0.97,837.636,840.973,With that we can move to the legislative agenda.,26,,
110,0.97,840.973,844.41,"Last time we provided an overview, a broad strokes overview of the agenda.",26,,
111,0.97,844.41,849.381,"Much of it has not changed, actually, since last year.",26,,
112,0.97,849.381,853.185,So we provided an overview of all of the major issues.,26,,
113,0.97,853.185,867.866,This presentation what we would like to do is focus on some of the changes that have been made both from feedback we've received from city departments as well as from your offices and central staff.,26,,
114,0.97,867.866,879.812,So to start things off I'm going to hand it over to Robin Koskey to talk about the first section which is the safe city section.,26,,
115,0.97,879.812,880.879,"Thank you very much, Quinn.",27,,
116,0.97,880.879,891.857,"Before I talk about the safe cities question, I did just want to mention we are closely monitoring what's going to happen with the Eviction moratorium and we'll just keep you posted on that.",27,,
117,0.97,891.857,899.531,I know there's a matter of interest and how that interacts with our city moratorium as well.,27,,
118,0.97,899.531,909.341,"Getting into the safe cities issue, today representative Goodman, chair of the public safety Committee in the house is hosting a work session on police reform.",27,,
119,0.97,909.341,920.019,Committee days are happening this week and so they should be providing a little bit more of an overview of what police reform proposals the House hopes to introduce this year.,27,,
120,0.97,920.019,922.187,I will certainly share notes with all of you.,27,,
121,0.97,922.187,927.96,"It might take me a bit to finalize them, but that should be an interesting meeting this afternoon.",27,,
122,0.97,927.96,951.65,"To highlight some of the changes in the safe city section of the agenda, I believe we did have some on the Covid response in the last agenda but certainly highlighting that that's there, including homelessness, small business and Eviction moratorium issues.",27,,
123,0.97,951.65,961.493,On police reform we made a few changes in how proposals are moving forward and what are priorities from legislators as well as other Stakeholders.,27,,
124,0.97,961.493,969.301,"We made some changes to language around arbitration, Decertify case, independent investigations.",27,,
125,0.97,969.301,969.835,We included Chokeholds.,27,,
126,0.97,969.835,974.373,Duty to intervene and duty to report.,27,,
127,0.97,974.373,984.35,Statewide use of force Database that we know from legislators are interested in working on and also misconduct thresholds.,27,,
128,0.97,984.35,996.562,We also added some gun control issues which included limiting open carry in dangerous environments and also increased legal productions and representation for sexual assault survivors.,27,,
129,0.97,996.562,1002.768,Those are the broad strokes of what we've changed in this also based on some comments from you as well.,27,,
130,0.97,1002.768,1012.845,I think if anyone has any questions that sums up my highlights for today.,27,,
131,0.97,1012.845,1013.178,Thanks.,28,,
132,0.97,1013.178,1031.263,Any questions on the changes highlighted by Robin or any additional requests for additions to what is currently in the draft?,28,,
133,0.97,1031.263,1034.867,Looks like nobody has questions so we can keep chugging along.,28,,
134,0.97,1034.867,1035.334,Thanks.,29,,
135,0.97,1035.334,1042.975,"Moving on to the vibrant cities section, which includes quite a number of different policy issue areas.",29,,
136,0.97,1042.975,1056.088,In the education section we expanded the section to include additional resources and funding for after school programs and summer learning.,29,,

141,0.97,1120.586,1141.206,"In the taxation section, in addition to the general broad support for moving towards more progressive revenue sources and the response to, in response to several Council member requests have included explicit support for a statewide capital gains tax and Progressive payroll tax.",29,,
142,0.97,1141.206,1160.092,We have also at Council member Pedersen's request included a change to a rather arcane element of the tax code that prevents the city from reducing our sales tax without it being increased at the county level.,29,,
143,0.97,1160.092,1173.105,"Which prevents us from it we were to get more progressive revenue sources, prevents us from decreasing our more Regressive ones.",29,,

157,0.97,1254.987,1275.941,We have a new section from the Department of transportation from Sdot talking about the importance of transportation safety in particular for vulnerable users and changes to state laws there that would allow us to Prioritize safety and achieve our emission zero goals.,31,,
158,0.97,1275.941,1291.823,We also from it Sdot and Council members have a new section on what we've come to call the Decriminalization of transportation activity.,31,,
159,0.97,1291.823,1297.963,"Which includes reducing the, reducing fines and citations for pedestrian activity.",31,,
160,0.97,1297.963,1303.335,Includes the Deweaponnization of traffic enforcement.,31,,
161,0.97,1303.335,1314.012,As well as greater allowances for Nonofficer enforcement of event and parking lot management.,31,,
162,0.97,1314.012,1320.752,That covers the primary changes in the interconnected cities so I'll pause again and see if there's any questions or additions.,31,,
163,0.97,1320.752,1326.358,"Any questions or additions, colleagues?",32,,
164,0.97,1326.358,1326.558,Okay.,32,,
165,0.97,1326.558,1328.56,Seeing none let's go to the next section.,32,,
166,0.97,1328.56,1328.827,Great.,33,,
167,0.97,1328.827,1334.933,I will hand it off to Hannah for the affordable cities section.,33,,
168,0.97,1334.933,1335.901,Good morning.,34,,
169,0.97,1335.901,1347.679,In the affordable cities section at the beginning we've added a new paragraph emphasizing the need to address the Covid-19 pandemic.,34,,
170,0.97,1347.679,1349.014,Specifically on housing and Affordability.,34,,
171,0.97,1349.014,1357.756,That includes language about new programs to relieve the effects of Covid-19 like rental and foreclosure assistance.,34,,
172,0.97,1357.756,1361.56,Utility assistance and a moratorium on Evictions throughout the crisis.,34,,
173,0.97,1361.56,1373.939,We're also keeping in mind a potential wave of Evictions that may come that many of you have flagged as a priority.,34,,
174,0.97,1373.939,1379.945,The Covid language is similar to previous years but framed in the urgency of the pandemic.,34,,
175,0.97,1379.945,1395.66,"Deeper into the section we've increased language on the flexibility for affordable housing financing, including language, expanding our language to include acquisition, development and operation of permanent supportive housing.",34,,
176,0.97,1395.66,1404.102,And at your request added some language to expand ownership models.,34,,
177,0.97,1404.102,1409.574,Including alternative models of Landownership as a means of providing affordable housing.,34,,
178,0.97,1409.574,1415.447,Those are the changes to the affordable city section.,34,,
179,0.97,1415.447,1418.316,If there's any questions.,34,,
180,0.97,1418.316,1420.485,Any questions or additions?,35,,
181,0.97,1420.485,1428.994,"Hearing none, we'll go ahead and go to the next section.",35,,
182,0.97,1428.994,1429.461,"Thank you, Hannah.",35,,
183,0.97,1429.461,1448.313,That concludes our overview of the sections of the legislative agenda so I guess we can go ahead and open up to more broadly any questions or changes that you would like to see to the cities 2021 legislative agenda.,36,,
184,0.97,1448.313,1451.349,"Thanks, Quinn, so much for that.",37,,
185,0.97,1451.349,1462.26,"Colleagues, any other comments or questions about the draft legislative agenda.",37,,
186,0.97,1462.26,1463.595,"Council member Herbold, please.",37,,
187,0.97,1463.595,1479.911,Want to thank Oir for being so Proactive in working with my office and appreciate being given a little extra time and we'll appreciate the fact that there are some changes we requested that haven't made it into this version yet.,38,,
188,0.97,1479.911,1484.182,I think we'll be getting them folded in before we see the next version.,38,,
189,0.97,1484.182,1484.616,So thanks again.,38,,
190,0.97,1484.616,1489.821,We know you've been busy.,39,,
191,0.97,1489.821,1491.756,Thank you Council member Herbold.,40,,
192,0.97,1491.756,1499.998,Any other comments or questions either on the process or on the substance of the legislative agenda?,40,,
193,0.97,1499.998,1500.198,Okay.,40,,
194,0.97,1500.198,1509.941,I'm not seeing any hands being raised and I don't have any messages from folks wanting to make any additional comments.,40,,
195,0.97,1509.941,1511.776,Wanted to echo my thanks for the Oir team.,40,,
196,0.97,1511.776,1514.579,I know you all have been working hard on pulling this together.,40,,
197,0.97,1514.579,1524.489,I know this legislative session is going to be a historic one for all of us.,40,,
198,0.97,1524.489,1557.489,"And appreciate, again, the opportunity to continue to have conversation with you all about how to create greater Connectivity between us as legislators at the city and the legislators at the state level, particularly some of our freshman legislators which we, some of us have Pre-Existing relationships with and others of us are looking to develop relationships, stronger relationships with those who are currently in the house or who are themselves also freshmen.",40,,
199,0.97,1557.489,1559.791,Appreciate the opportunity to work together.,40,,
200,0.97,1559.791,1574.439,"Colleagues, again, for any of you who might take a closer look at the draft after today's meeting and have additional thoughts I strongly encourage you to reach out to the team at Oir right away.",40,,
201,0.97,1574.439,1593.325,"We are hoping to be able to get this on the introduction and referral calendar for consideration on Monday, December 7th but we have given ourselves an extra week in case Úthere is suddenly a flurry of ideas and modifications that Oir has to work through.",40,,
202,0.97,1593.325,1595.994,So December 14th is our backstop date.,40,,
203,0.97,1595.994,1599.597,Ideally we'd like to get this resolved on December 7th.,40,,
204,0.97,1599.597,1602.5,Particularly if there is going to be a special legislative session.,40,,
205,0.97,1602.5,1615.013,I think it'll be important for our team at Oir to have as much guidance and firm guidance as possible before any kind of special session is called for.,40,,
206,0.97,1615.013,1641.239,"So again, please, my request is that you Prioritize taking one last look at this draft getting any feedback to Oir, my office will stay in close connection with the folks over at Oir to make a determination as to whether or not December 7th is the viable opportunity for us to take a final vote on this matter in full council.",40,,
207,0.97,1641.239,1643.742,That's the goal and that's the hope.,40,,
208,0.97,1643.742,1645.944,Our backstop will be December 14th.,40,,
209,0.97,1645.944,1649.18,December 7th is the target here.,40,,
210,0.97,1649.18,1649.381,Okay.,40,,
211,0.97,1649.381,1658.089,"Well thank you so much director Wilson-Codega, do you have any other comments you'd like to make as we say good-bye to you all?",40,,
212,0.97,1658.089,1658.39,Nope.,41,,
213,0.97,1658.39,1659.157,That concludes our presentation.,41,,
214,0.97,1659.157,1665.697,Just appreciate your attention to that hoping for passage on the 7th.,41,,
215,0.97,1665.697,1665.997,Okay.,42,,
216,0.97,1665.997,1666.231,Robin.,42,,
217,0.97,1666.231,1668.9,"Thank you so much, everyone.",43,,
218,0.97,1668.9,1669.3,Thank you.,44,,
219,0.97,1669.3,1669.667,All right.,45,,
220,0.97,1669.667,1673.638,Thank you all so much.,45,,
221,0.97,1673.638,1677.409,And we will be in touch.,45,,
222,0.97,1677.409,1677.909,Thank you.,45,,
223,0.97,1677.909,1678.943,"Okay, colleagues.",45,,
224,0.97,1678.943,1689.421,We're going to move through our agenda and we'll move into our preview of today's city council actions Council and regional committees.,45,,
225,0.97,1689.421,1695.56,Today's rotation order will be as follows.,45,,
226,0.97,1695.56,1700.231,We'll first start with Councilmember Pedersen.,45,,
227,0.97,1700.231,1701.366,I will conclude this agenda discussion.,45,,
228,0.97,1701.366,1705.503,Please keep in mind we do have an executive session scheduled for today.,45,,
229,0.97,1705.503,1719.851,It is scheduled to last at least 30 minutes so my hope is that we'll be able to get it done within those 30 minutes and we'll be able to wrap up this morning's Council briefing by no later than 11:30 A.M.,45,,
230,0.97,1719.851,1725.023,Although we're a little ahead of schedule now.,45,,
231,0.97,1725.023,1730.261,Let's begin our discussion of today's city council action.,45,,
232,0.97,1730.261,1737.168,First up is Council member Pedersen and then Sawant.,45,,
233,0.97,1737.168,1738.369,Good morning.,46,,
234,0.97,1738.369,1738.67,Thank you.,46,,
235,0.97,1738.67,1739.104,"Hello, colleagues.",46,,
236,0.97,1739.104,1744.576,The transportation and utilities committee has no items on today's full city council agenda.,46,,
237,0.97,1744.576,1750.882,"Our transportation and utilities committee meets this Wednesday, December 2ND at 9:30 A.M.",46,,
238,0.97,1750.882,1754.152,"And again Wednesday, December 16th at 9:30 A.M.",46,,
239,0.97,1754.152,1775.507,"This Wednesday, December 2ND the agenda includes property easements and other technical updates from Seattle city light and Seattle public utilities regarding transportation this Wednesday's agenda includes Council bill 119960 which is a six month extension of the existing transit service funding agreement with King County Metro.",46,,
240,0.97,1775.507,1790.855,This brief six month extension is needed because the previous six year Seattle transportation benefit district was written in 2014 to expire at the end of this year rather than providing any cushion on timing in case it was renewed or extended in some form.,46,,
241,0.97,1790.855,1795.66,The sales tax was renewed overwhelmingly by voters earlier this month.,46,,
242,0.97,1795.66,1805.37,Next year is when we will review and adopt a more extensive longer term service funding agreement with King County Metro for our supplemental bus service.,46,,
243,0.97,1805.37,1809.407,This agenda item is just a six month extension of the existing one.,46,,
244,0.97,1809.407,1824.722,Speaking of the increased sales tax for the Seattle transportation benefit district this Wednesday's agenda also includes Council bill 119959 which officially imposes the tax which voters authorized last month.,46,,
245,0.97,1824.722,1848.813,Neither of these Council bills should be controversial the more Substantivizations will occur earlier next year when we review the new transit services agreement and when we finally allocate the remaining reserves from the old 2014 STBD measure and the new revenues from the license fee.,46,,
246,0.97,1848.813,1857.121,This will occur after Sdot Stakeholder investment process.,46,,
247,0.97,1857.121,1857.622,Thank you.,46,,
248,0.97,1857.622,1860.058,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen for that report.",47,,
249,0.97,1860.058,1863.895,Any questions or comments on that report?,47,,
250,0.97,1863.895,1871.736,"Okay, hearing none we'll go ahead and hear now from Councilmember Sawant and then we will hear from Councilmember Strauss.",47,,
251,0.97,1871.736,1872.103,Good morning.,47,,
252,0.97,1872.103,1875.34,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez and good morning, everyone.",48,,
253,0.97,1875.34,1881.045,There are no items on today's city council agenda from it the Sustainability and Renters rights committee.,48,,
254,0.97,1881.045,1889.921,We were unable to convene the last meeting because it was during the Thanksgiving week.,48,,
255,0.97,1889.921,1902.467,Because the committee meets on the fourth Tuesday in each month it would now fall during the winter recess in December so my office will be contacting committee members to find a special time to hold a committee meeting.,48,,
256,0.97,1902.467,1926.924,Today at the city council Meetingly circulate for signatures the ledger to Seattle police Department chief Diaz requesting that the Department urgently compile and release all of their records regarding the death of Herbert Hightower Jr. who was fatally shot by Seattle police in 2004 while experiencing a mental health crisis.,48,,
257,0.97,1926.924,1939.07,These public records were requested in August by the family and on behalf of the family and the justice for Herbert Hightower Jr. movement.,48,,
258,0.97,1939.07,1948.813,My office has been in contact with Hightower who Councilmembers will have heard Stephing about this in the last months.,48,,
259,0.97,1948.813,1968.032,"Has reported that the police Department responded to their public records request with delay after delay first promising them by September 21st, then October 14th, then November 5th and now November 30th which is today and as of last night she has not still received the records.",48,,
260,0.97,1968.032,1980.278,"It is understandable that all records would require some time to recover from it archives, but it is unacceptable to make this family wait months to release records about the death of their loved one.",48,,
261,0.97,1980.278,1992.59,"The Hightower family is now supported by more than 1,850 community members who have signed a petition demanding that Seattle police release those public records.",48,,
262,0.97,1992.59,1996.194,My office has circulated a draft of the ledger to your offices.,48,,
263,0.97,1996.194,2002.934,A couple of weeks ago and I wanted to thank Councilmember Herbold for all her Edits.,48,,
264,0.97,2002.934,2009.24,All of the Edits have been incorporated into the latest draft that has resent to you all from my office.,48,,
265,0.97,2009.24,2012.043,Hopefully it should be at the top of all your Inboxes.,48,,
266,0.97,2012.043,2024.622,I look forward to any questions or any further proposed Edits Úbut I would like to circulate this and really hope for all of your support for the ledger.,48,,
267,0.97,2024.622,2024.922,Thank you.,48,,
268,0.97,2024.922,2027.525,"Thank you, council member Sawant.",49,,
269,0.97,2027.525,2030.561,I see Councilmember Herbold has a comment.,49,,
270,0.97,2030.561,2031.062,Councilmember Herbold.,49,,
271,0.97,2031.062,2032.897,Thank you so much.,50,,
272,0.97,2032.897,2043.074,I just want to mention that I have discussed this letter with Seattle police chief Diaz and Dr. Christopher Fisher.,50,,
273,0.97,2043.074,2064.128,They have both explained they can't actually Prioritize some cases over others though they appreciate our Uplifting the Council's concern around the Timelines associated with responding to this request and other requests.,50,,
274,0.97,2064.128,2086.15,Additional language that I requested that Councilmember Sawant include in this letter includes basically the language that is contained on SPD's Website informing people about the length of time that they should expect for receiving a response to a public disclosure request.,50,,
275,0.97,2086.15,2097.028,Also want to highlight that the city auditor has identified issues associated with responding to the public disclosure process in the Seattle police Department.,50,,
276,0.97,2097.028,2101.132,Some of those issues are staffing issues.,50,,
277,0.97,2101.132,2106.871,But others are issues related to technology.,50,,
278,0.97,2106.871,2127.525,"The audit itself was in 2015 and as I think everybody knows the city auditor does an annual report on previous years recommendations to report out to the Council, the executive and the general public on what items the Department's being audited have responded to.",50,,
279,0.97,2127.525,2137.435,"As I mentioned, staffing remains to be a challenge but also technology is a real challenge that the Department faces.",50,,
280,0.97,2137.435,2163.995,"They write, SPD is one of the few departments asked to process its own E-mail searches rather than referring to the Seattle information technology Department and they do not have access to an E-mail review platform that can perform searches with accuracy, speed, Reduplication capability Enthe current system frequently crashes.",50,,
281,0.97,2163.995,2184.282,"This report from December of, well, it was a report I think we received in early 2020 but it was on 2019 updates but they say that SPD hopes to procure access to a more efficient system in 2020.",50,,
282,0.97,2184.282,2186.851,I don't know whether that's happened.,50,,
283,0.97,2186.851,2187.318,I will be checking.,50,,
284,0.97,2187.318,2201.399,Spd continues to struggle with the amount of Video it's required to produce not only for public disclosure but responsive to legal discovery for prosecution and subpoenas which are attached to strict court ordered deadlines.,50,,
285,0.97,2201.399,2205.469,The Video unit process thousands of such requests on a monthly basis.,50,,
286,0.97,2205.469,2228.659,"Particularly with respect to in car Video which also requires time intensive searching and Downloading the CDs, processing delays can be significant and then they go on to say that SPD is in the process of Procuring a new in car Video system which computer aided design integration and Cloud-Based storage which will reduce delivery and processing times.",50,,
287,0.97,2228.659,2244.175,"Again, these are two items I intend to check up on that I think were supposed to be delivered in 2020 that are distinct from the staffing challenges that SPD faces that are legitimate staffing challenges for sure.",50,,
288,0.97,2244.175,2253.884,"But I also just, again, want to highlight that we can send this letter but the police Department cannot Prioritize one case over another.",50,,
289,0.97,2253.884,2261.726,They have to take them in order of the request.,50,,
290,0.97,2261.726,2262.96,Thank you.,50,,
291,0.97,2262.96,2266.13,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",51,,
292,0.97,2266.13,2274.238,Any other comments on the letter?,51,,
293,0.97,2274.238,2274.438,Okay.,51,,
294,0.97,2274.438,2307.004,I also just want to echo the reality around the fact that SPD has an inability to Prioritize one public records request over the other even though Councilmembers may be signaling their support for this letter and so that is,51,,
295,0.97,2647.644,2649.48,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",52,,
296,0.97,2649.48,2651.148,Any comments or questions on that report?,52,,
297,0.97,2651.148,2654.618,Hearing none we'll go ahead and go down the line.,52,,
298,0.97,2654.618,2668.298,Council member Herbold is next followed by Council member Juarez.,52,,
299,0.97,2668.298,2691.055,No items on the full council agenda from the public safety and human services committee.,53,,
300,0.97,2691.055,2700.631,Income an initial discussion on a proposed piece of legislation granting the OPA and the Oig subpoena power.,53,,
301,0.97,2700.631,2726.19,"We are also, I believe, having a briefing from the Colead program.",53,,
302,0.97,2727.858,2732.129,Folks living in shelter in response to community needs.,53,,
303,0.97,2732.129,2741.238,To address the impacts of those folks both impacts to the people who are living outside as well as the surrounding community.,53,,
304,0.97,2741.238,2769.933,I believe we are also going to have an initial discussion related to the proposal to provide a legal defense for people committing certain Misdemeanors and when those Misdemeanors have linkages to peoples poverty and or mental or substance abuse disorder conditions.,53,,
305,0.97,2769.933,2776.54,So not discussing an actual bill but some of the concepts we might contain in such a piece of legislation.,53,,
306,0.97,2776.54,2790.654,Just want to give my weekly Shoutout to the Seattle fire Department for their Covid-19 test administered at their four sites.,53,,
307,0.97,2790.654,2799.329,"We're now cumulatively at 404,000 tests that have been administered between June 5th and November 23rd.",53,,

362,0.97,3105.836,3108.538,I'll jump right into it.,57,,
363,0.97,3108.538,3116.546,"First there are no items on this afternoon's agenda from the select Committee on homelessness, strategies and investments.",57,,
364,0.97,3116.546,3129.693,It is my hope we will schedule a December committee meeting before we go on break and my office is in touch with Council President's office to arrange the scheduling for such a committee meeting.,57,,
365,0.97,3129.693,3154.384,I do want to transition that I enjoyed reading over the break a column written by Danny Westneed in the Seattle times imploring that the city create 1000 tiny houses as part of our strategy to respond to the ongoing state of emergency and crisis of our neighbors experiencing homelessness.,57,,
366,0.97,3154.384,3162.859,I appreciate that he highlighted that this Council did expand tiny House placements by 120 units.,57,,
367,0.97,3162.859,3170.333,I read with just as much pleasure a rebuttal by Erica C.,57,,
368,0.97,3170.333,3181.745,Barnett on public laying out this is only as useful the tiny House strategy as exits to permanent supportive housing are readily available.,57,,
369,0.97,3181.745,3213.843,"And, you know, it's with that transition having that conversation over the break that I think today is a particularly appropriate day to announce a project I've been working with the third door coalition on for the last couple of months on permanent supportive housing and ways that we as a city can loosen and streamline certain land use controls to make permanent supportive housing a cheaper and faster thing to build in the city of Seattle.",57,,
370,0.97,3213.843,3231.328,Just to start off for the viewing public we know that 98% of chronically homeless individuals accept offers into permanent housing.,57,,
371,0.97,3231.328,3251.081,"As many of us know who have been talking to providers and advocates, our region needs about of folks who are chronically homeless who will need a permanent supportive housing placement to be successful.",57,,
372,0.97,3251.081,3271.034,"So with that, my office has been working since the big announcement in the spring by the unlikely alliance of the third door coalition which is an alliance of business luminaries like matt Galvin and Chad McKay.",57,,
373,0.97,3271.034,3348.178,Along with folks in the provider community like professor Sarah Rankin and Paul Lambrose of Plymouth housing and Dan Malone of Desc to talk together about how they can work towards a common goal of Scaling up more permanent the levy process decide to spend to scale up more permanent supportive housing.,57,,
374,0.97,3348.178,3356.519,"Given that we're in a state of emergency on homelessness, we need to do everything that's in our power to stretch those limited public resources.",57,,
375,0.97,3356.519,3364.828,And that's why today I'm announcing a bill to implement some of the reforms that third door coalition has identified and called for.,57,,
376,0.97,3364.828,3371.034,And that bill will be ready for introduction and referral on Friday of this week.,57,,
377,0.97,3371.034,3406.503,For the first time this bill will define permanent supportive housing as multifamily units with 90% percent of the units below 50% area median income and a project that by design receives public money given it is for cases at zero area median income or there Abouts and the housing includes on site services and case management typical of permanent supportive housing and that would be part of the definition.,57,,
378,0.97,3406.503,3425.889,"The bill would then go further and cut a considerable amount of red tape in our development regulations as a city, including a permanent exemption for permanent supportive housing from design review.",57,,
379,0.97,3425.889,3430.86,Age ere an exemption from short term bike storage and on site bike storage requirements.,57,,
380,0.97,3430.86,3450.013,Authority for the director of Sdci to waive or modify development standards to maximize permanent supportive housing units in a given project and to allow permanent supportive housing to be cited in commercial 2 zones in addition to residential multifamily zones.,57,,
381,0.97,3450.013,3469.032,Critically the bill would retain and codify that providers like Desc and Plymouth House willing used to and have successfully delivered on as partners in being House progress Siders in our region for decades.,57,,
382,0.97,3469.032,3486.249,"These reforms were produced in collaboration with the third door coalition to lower that per unit cost and according to their calculations, these reforms could lower the per unit cost from the current $331,000 to $284,000 per unit.",57,,
383,0.97,3486.249,3490.72,"A savings of almost $47,000 per unit.",57,,
384,0.97,3490.72,3496.759,This legislation was developed with support from the office of housing and from Sdci.,57,,
385,0.97,3496.759,3517.146,"I want to thank the third door coalition members particularly matt Galvin, Chad McKay, professor Sarah Rankin and a former planning chair, particularly for a lot of the details and the calculations of the potential savings per housing unit.",57,,
386,0.97,3517.146,3542.171,It's my hope that this legislation will be referred to the select Committee on homelessness as Council member Strauss indicated earlier in his remarks that is acceptable to him based on the docket for the land use committee and that this will probably require an extensive amount of discussion MARKUP and deliberation as it makes its way through the Council.,57,,
387,0.97,3542.171,3551.547,This would be in keeping with the tiny House legislation that Councilmember Sawant sent through earlier in year.,57,,
388,0.97,3551.547,3559.322,I'm hoping to have an initial hearing on this in December before recess and then to take this up again in January.,57,,
389,0.97,3559.322,3570.5,As I said the details and the legislation will be publicly posted this week and hopefully it'll be ready for introduction and referral on Friday.,57,,
390,0.97,3570.5,3578.875,I'm happy to answer any questions now or Reserve them until briefing next Monday when folks have had an opportunity to review the actual bill.,57,,
391,0.97,3578.875,3601.631,But I do think this is an exciting opportunity to work with our provider community to work with the business community and to bring folks together to really focus on how we can stretch our public money to maximize the investment in this critical housing we know we're going to need more of and I look forward to discussing this over the next several months.,57,,
392,0.97,3601.631,3606.102,With that I don't have any additional updates.,57,,
393,0.97,3606.102,3610.84,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis for that report.",58,,
394,0.97,3610.84,3617.847,"Colleagues, any comments or questions on that report at this juncture?",58,,
395,0.97,3617.847,3618.047,Okay.,58,,
396,0.97,3618.047,3618.781,Hearing none.,58,,
397,0.97,3618.781,3645.808,"Colleagues, of course, the select Committee on homelessness strategies and investments is a committee of the whole which means all nine Councilmembers are members of that particular committee so we will work closely with Councilmember Lewis' office to make sure there is an opportunity in the next two weeks for him to have and convene a select committee meeting.",58,,
398,0.97,3645.808,3666.996,And of course it's always like playing a little bit of Jenga here as it relates to the calendar and getting virtual space in the schedule but we will do our best to accommodate the request to have at least an initial conversation on that particular issue.,58,,
399,0.97,3666.996,3672.635,So look forward to working with your office on that.,58,,
400,0.97,3672.635,3672.835,Okay.,58,,
401,0.97,3672.835,3683.98,Seeing and hearing no other questions we will go ahead and hand it over now to Councilmember Morales then I will conclude this portion of the agenda.,58,,
402,0.97,3683.98,3684.48,"Morning, everyone.",59,,
403,0.97,3684.48,3692.121,I hope you were able to enjoy a little bit of relaxation over the last few days.,59,,
404,0.97,3692.121,3700.43,There are no items from the community economic development Committee on this afternoon's agenda and we also do not have a meeting scheduled for this month.,59,,
405,0.97,3700.43,3704.2,The next meeting will be January 19th at 2:00 P.M.,59,,
406,0.97,3704.2,3712.842,On Wednesday of this week I do have a meeting of the central Puget sound economic development district board.,59,,
407,0.97,3712.842,3723.753,We met with several constituents over the weekend to discuss public health guidance for reopening to indoor gatherings.,59,,
408,0.97,3723.753,3733.896,Now that the winter has locked down again folks are wondering when they will be able to plan for reopening and what sha that should look like given now that we're in the third wave.,59,,
409,0.97,3733.896,3736.065,I know folks have lots of concern about that.,59,,
410,0.97,3736.065,3741.938,Also talked to many people about small business assistance.,59,,
411,0.97,3741.938,3744.607,The assistance that's in development that will be coming from the state level.,59,,
412,0.97,3744.607,3754.584,People are very interested to know what that might look like and whether the city will be able to fill gaps that the state is not able to meet.,59,,
413,0.97,3754.584,3768.531,"As a reminder, speaking of small business, we do have an additional $4 million in small business Stabilization and economic opportunity grants available.",59,,
414,0.97,3768.531,3772.535,Today is the last day to apply for one of those grants.,59,,
415,0.97,3772.535,3787.416,"These provide up to $10,000 grants for small businesses throughout Seattle who have been financially impacted by Covid-19 and you can apply nor that.",59,,
416,0.97,3787.416,3791.42,If they go to Seattle.Gov Oed Website the application link is there.,59,,
417,0.97,3791.42,3805.668,"And as a final reminder if you're planning your holiday shopping, please consider shopping local and supporting your local Seattle independent businesses who need all the help they can get right now.",59,,
418,0.97,3805.668,3806.869,Please do that.,59,,
419,0.97,3806.869,3821.684,I do want to mention briefly over the last week I'm sure we all heard the report that came out of public health Seattle King County called where is Covid-19 transmitted in King County.,59,,
420,0.97,3821.684,3824.854,I just wanted to share one piece about this.,59,,
421,0.97,3824.854,3837.967,The report discusses some of the key root causes that were identified early in the pandemic why communities of color carry a disproportionate burden from Covid-19.,59,,
422,0.97,3837.967,3850.112,"Two things that stuck out, living in larger or Multigenerational households make it harder for households to limit their exposure.",59,,
423,0.97,3850.112,3856.819,And there's an Overrepresentation among Esential workers who have to be at their job sites and to commute.,59,,
424,0.97,3856.819,3874.237,These two root causes may compound each other when multiple residents work as essential workers in different locations or at multiple jobs then return home under one roof and that increases the likelihood that someone could expose someone else in the household.,59,,
425,0.97,3874.237,3888.451,As the report indicated we are finding this to be true especially in South King County and some offer South end neighborhoods where we have large families of Multigenerations living together and who are having to commute throughout the city to get to work.,59,,
426,0.97,3888.451,3904.0,So I say that because it's an important reminder about why those of us who have the option to stay home really need to stay home so we can protect the rest of our neighbors who don't have the option.,59,,
427,0.97,3904.0,3908.404,I know we're all eager to get out.,59,,
428,0.97,3908.404,3910.273,Eager to get into our community again.,59,,
429,0.97,3910.273,3921.484,E we really need to make sure we're keeping one another safe and that means staying home if it's at all possible.,59,,
430,0.97,3921.484,3928.157,That is all that I have this morning.,59,,
431,0.97,3928.157,3932.495,Thank you for that report.,60,,
432,0.97,3932.495,3933.696,Any comments or questions?,60,,
433,0.97,3933.696,3933.896,Okay.,60,,

439,0.97,3956.185,3997.56,We will take up what we are referring to as a flexibility ordinance to allow in some instances for some additional flexibility as the delivery of services and programs funded by the levy continue to be impacted by remote learning and emerging and pressing means related to child care so looking forward to having deal with us on December 8th to have a conversation about their proposal related to expenditures and programming of those dollars for the 2021-2022 school year.,60,,
