42,0.97,170.403,177.176,"I would like to begin by reading the proclamation, it's attached like I said it's all ready posted for people to see.",14,,
43,0.97,177.176,180.713,I'm guessing our guests all ready have a copy of it as well.,14,,
44,0.97,180.713,188.655,So I want to read just the sections that I had outlines last week about this proclamation.,14,,
45,0.97,188.655,190.023,Oh my God.,14,,
46,0.97,190.023,191.057,You know what.,14,,
47,0.97,191.057,192.992,Sorry about this.,14,,
48,0.97,192.992,195.895,Adult children love to call you at work.,14,,
49,0.97,195.895,200.767,"So let me go and read, which I think is very important in our proclamation.",14,,
50,0.97,200.767,215.515,"Where as title nine has in the 50 years since its passage, expanded opportunities for women and girls in sports and in science, technology, engineering nd math fields and improved protections for pregnant and parenting students.",14,,
51,0.97,215.515,220.453,"Where as in February 2022, the U.S. soccer Federation governing body and the U.S.",14,,
52,0.97,220.453,234.133,Women's National team announced a settlement to resolve the long standing pay dispute with the Federation agreeing to pay two teams equally in next Union contract and give the women's team 22 Million-Dollars in back pay.,14,,
53,0.97,234.133,241.908,"Where as in Seattle, we celebrate our local women's professional sports teams, including the Seattle storm and OL rain.",14,,
54,0.97,241.908,249.182,And where as the Seattle storm and OL rain have demonstrated their impact to give back to their community and influence social change.,14,,
55,0.97,249.182,261.394,"And where as the Seattle storm forced for change brings together players, the front office, ownership and partners to focus on five key areas of impact.",14,,
56,0.97,261.394,267.9,"Voting and education, Bipoc youth, amplification of black women.",14,,
57,0.97,267.9,270.336,Amplification of Lgbtq leaders of color.,14,,
58,0.97,270.336,313.946,"And organizations serving black communities and where as since 2020 OL rain has formed a strong partnership with the Washington--with Washington's first Black-Led Philanthropy, the black future Co-op fund to call attention to their mission to ignite black wealth, health, well being over generations and where as in part due to the partnership with OL rain, the black future Co-op fund has been able to grant 1 1√Å million to 40 organizations where as the city is proud to support youth organizations that work with girls, like rise above, that provide tailored education programs with basketball clinics at the center to empower native American youth to lead healthy lives.",14,,
59,0.97,313.946,325.358,Where as the city of Seattle is committed to strengthening our commitment to women and girls sports in celebrating their various achievements.,14,,
60,0.97,325.358,331.564,Where as title nine must be strengthened and vigorously enforced to protect student's civil rights.,14,,
61,0.97,331.564,340.039,Now therefore the Mayor and the city of Seattle will indeed soon proclaim Thursday June 23rd to be the 50th anniversary of title nine.,14,,
62,0.97,340.039,347.58,"And so with that, I would now like to introduce Jenny Gelder from the Seattle storm.",14,,
63,0.97,347.58,350.316,Jenny is the co-owner of the Seattle storm.,14,,
64,0.97,350.316,354.654,Our city's only professional sports team to win four national championships.,14,,
65,0.97,354.654,363.529,"Jenny is also the author of the book course correction, a story of rowing and resilience in the wake of title nine.",14,,
66,0.97,363.529,372.805,I would like to share a Two- minute Video in title nine recommended to our Council by a Councilmember.,14,,
67,0.97,372.805,373.539,Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda.,14,,
68,0.97,373.539,384.083,Can we go ahead with that now.,14,,
69,0.97,411.144,412.478,We didn't have showers.,15,,
70,0.97,412.478,419.485,So the first thing that started happening as we started doing practices out there is that people started getting sick.,15,,
71,0.97,419.485,429.896,And that was when the idea of a protest started to develop during these conversations on the bus while we were waiting for the men.,15,,
72,0.97,429.896,443.643,And it was led by Chris Ernst and Ann Werner who were really upset that the University wasn't taking care of us as athletes.,15,,
73,0.97,448.815,458.991,"The Alums were calling and writing and saying get those girls showers in some cases and in other cases, why did you ever admit women.",15,,
74,0.97,458.991,464.063,That was the full Gamet of the reaction by alumni.,15,,
75,0.97,464.063,470.436,But Yeah it was shamed to having to build an addition to the boat house.,15,,
76,0.97,470.436,474.774,The Bay six of title nine haven't changed.,15,,
77,0.97,474.774,477.443,It's about generating access to educational opportunity.,15,,
78,0.97,477.443,479.812,It's not just about access to playing sports.,15,,
79,0.97,479.812,481.547,Although sports is an important part of it.,15,,
80,0.97,481.547,485.117,Really the law is not being Ep forced all over the country.,15,,
81,0.97,485.117,487.453,In small programs and in bigger programs.,15,,
82,0.97,487.453,490.857,There's still a huge amount of discrimination.,15,,
83,0.97,490.857,498.13,Built-in bias that boys are more important as athletes than girls.,15,,
84,0.97,498.13,507.306,In most environments there's a lot of work to do to ferret out discrimination and level the playing field.,15,,
85,0.97,507.306,509.842,Without title nine you would not have the Wnba.,16,,
86,0.97,509.842,519.619,"You would not have all the women who get to compete at the Olympic level at elite levels, in whatever sport you're talking.",16,,
87,0.97,519.619,524.857,Then you see all these little girls standing up and getting their photographs taken.,16,,
88,0.97,524.857,528.661,And if that doesn't talk to you about what the future means for them.,16,,
89,0.97,528.661,529.795,How they see themselves here.,16,,
90,0.97,529.795,534.767,And start to envision their own futures.,16,,
91,0.97,534.767,539.138,That's pretty powerful.,16,,
92,0.97,539.872,547.246,"The mission of rise above is really to educate, empower, and create some resiliency in native American youth.",16,,
93,0.97,548.047,552.285,I think we're going to save that one for when it's Jackie's turn.,17,,
94,0.97,552.285,559.425,"So with that, Jenny, thank you for the--first of all, thank you Councilmember Mosqueda, her husband produced that.",17,,
95,0.97,559.425,562.795,It was wonderful watching that picture of you in the day.,17,,
96,0.97,562.795,567.466,"So Jenny, is there anything that you'd like to share with us now?",17,,
97,0.97,567.466,571.404,"First of all, I want to thank the city council.",18,,
98,0.97,571.404,576.676,"And especially you, Council president for helping to forward this proclamation.",18,,
99,0.97,576.676,577.243,It's incredibly meaningful.,18,,
100,0.97,577.243,582.381,I think not just for the storm and the rain but for girls and women throughout the community.,18,,
101,0.97,582.381,585.051,I really says something about who our city is.,18,,
102,0.97,585.051,598.631,"But you know, I think that Video actually does a pretty good job in capturing the fact that the Seattle storm really represents the success of title noon in expanding access to opportunity for girls and women.",18,,
103,0.97,598.631,601.834,And everybody knows about its impact on sports.,18,,
104,0.97,601.834,604.704,But it's really--it goes so much further than sports.,18,,
105,0.97,604.704,609.742,Title nine was really about obviously access to education.,18,,
106,0.97,609.742,616.148,"But because girls and boys can go to storm games, they get to see women doing what they love for a living.",18,,
107,0.97,616.148,619.919,And they get to just assume that that's how life is.,18,,
108,0.97,619.919,622.221,"50 years ago, that just wasn't the case.",18,,
109,0.97,622.221,630.096,It was barely Thinkable in the early 1970s that girls would want to play sports just like boys.,18,,
110,0.97,630.096,637.737,Much less that they'd harbor the same kinds of dreams of pursuing their passions as paid professionals.,18,,
111,0.97,637.737,639.238,Now look where we are today.,18,,
112,0.97,639.238,640.673,At least here in Seattle.,18,,
113,0.97,640.673,644.577,We have not just one but two women Pro-Sports teams.,18,,
114,0.97,644.577,648.781,"We have Olympic gold Medalists, League Mvps.",18,,
115,0.97,648.781,657.523,"Championship trophies and in sue Byrd, Arguably the best, most loyal, longest Tenured Pro- athlete in the city's history.",18,,
116,0.97,657.523,663.029,"Because of title nine, we haven't just transformed access to education.",18,,
117,0.97,663.029,664.53,We've transformed our communities across the country.,18,,
118,0.97,664.53,673.305,"Because now we get all the power and passion of girls and women translated into action, not just on playing fields.",18,,
119,0.97,673.305,676.175,But this is like our city council.,18,,
120,0.97,676.175,678.778,Our vice president of the country.,18,,
121,0.97,678.778,680.679,Businesses across the country.,18,,
122,0.97,680.679,685.151,And I really just want to thank the city for this proclamation.,18,,
123,0.97,685.151,700.7,"And making it possible for the storm to be part of the community, invest back to support the citizens who live here and help grow access to opportunity for Everybod.",18,,
124,0.97,700.7,702.668,"Thank you, Jenny.",19,,
125,0.97,702.668,703.636,So don't go.,20,,
126,0.97,703.636,709.341,So what I would like to do is introduce and open up the floor.,20,,
127,0.97,709.341,713.512,I know we probably have comments from some of my colleagues here.,20,,
128,0.97,713.512,720.486,"I'd like to introduce our other recipient of the proclamation, Miss Jackie McCormick.",20,,
129,0.97,720.486,722.321,He insure founded rise above.,20,,
130,0.97,722.321,729.628,Dedicated to developing and Nurturing athletic and leadership talent in indigenous youth in our city and statewide.,20,,
131,0.97,729.628,737.47,"Before Jackie speaks, we also have a short Video about rise above and I will let Jackie talk about rise above and let her have the floor.",20,,
132,0.97,737.47,750.282,So can we go ahead with the Video for Jackie McCormick.,20,,
133,0.97,759.592,770.703,"The mission of rise above is really to educate, empower, and create some resiliency in native American youth using sport as a modality or sport as a platform.",20,,
134,0.97,771.604,773.939,And it's only sport because that's what I know.,20,,
135,0.97,773.939,775.508,And that's what I did.,20,,
136,0.97,775.508,778.911,Is I used sport.,20,,
137,0.97,778.911,783.749,Speeblg her Grandpa and Grandma will take them to all Indian basketball tournaments with the older girls.,20,,
138,0.97,783.749,785.518,So like high school and adults.,20,,
139,0.97,785.518,786.552,They'd throw her in there.,20,,
140,0.97,786.552,788.854,And you could see she was ready to play.,20,,
141,0.97,788.854,791.157,And she wanted to play.,20,,
142,0.97,791.157,793.692,She wanted to show what she was capable of.,20,,
143,0.97,793.692,800.9,"When I went off to Illinois state, I stepped foot on campus, I knew in a I had to give back.",21,,
144,0.97,800.9,804.603,So rise above was founded in 2015.,21,,
145,0.97,804.603,808.073,But the idea of rose above started way before that.,21,,
146,0.97,808.073,809.875,You have to have an example.,21,,
147,0.97,809.875,814.68,"You have to believe that yes, I can to this.",21,,
148,0.97,814.68,814.88,Okay.,21,,
149,0.97,814.88,817.349,And she's done it.,21,,
150,0.97,817.349,826.525,"If you are looking for someone to look up to, here's her story.",21,,
151,0.97,826.525,830.362,We need to tell it.,21,,
152,0.97,847.213,848.581,"Jackie, the floor is yours.",22,,
153,0.97,848.581,850.149,Thank you.,23,,
154,0.97,850.149,855.988,"Well, again, I just want to say the same thing as Miss Gilder.",23,,
155,0.97,855.988,871.47,"Really thanking the city Council, the city of Seattle, but for me, most importantly, Council President Juarez for not only your advocacy for this but really spearheading all the work that you do and making sure Indian country has representation.",23,,
156,0.97,871.47,874.506,We all know representation matters and it goes a long way.,23,,
157,0.97,874.506,883.315,"So you know, when I think about title nine and some of the sacrifices, I think it is overwhelming to think about how far we've come.",23,,
158,0.97,883.315,885.484,But how far we still have to go.,23,,
159,0.97,885.484,893.125,"And for me, you know, I grew up listening to my great Grandma talk about basketball and being able to play six on six.",23,,
160,0.97,893.125,895.594,And they can only do half cower.,23,,
161,0.97,895.594,897.596,And you couldn't over exert yourself too much.,23,,
162,0.97,897.596,903.302,And my mom who raised me was my Grandma and not being able to have any organized sports.,23,,
163,0.97,903.302,910.075,Bt we traveled all across Indian country and playing basketball and me watching them be passionate about the game.,23,,
164,0.97,910.075,916.916,"My great Grandma being the first Councilwoman, my Council for nest first tribe.",23,,
165,0.97,916.916,917.683,That's a lot.,23,,
166,0.97,917.683,920.619,And that all goes back into title nine.,23,,
167,0.97,920.619,936.835,And I think another shoe that I have to fill or had to fill growing up was my biological mom shortly after title nine was passed was they won the state tournament for our little reservation town and she was named the first Idaho state Player of the year.,23,,
168,0.97,936.835,941.14,"So through sport, it really has got me to where I am today.",23,,
169,0.97,941.14,958.123,"And I think all the sacrifices that women before us, you know, put into advancing women and not having any discrimination and using it as an education kind of a tool in sport was kind of a side thing of that.",23,,
170,0.97,958.123,960.859,It's really amazing how far we've come.,23,,
171,0.97,960.859,962.328,But like Miss Gilder said.,23,,
172,0.97,962.328,965.397,There's a lot of work to be done.,23,,
173,0.97,965.397,968.267,Take last year's Ncaa tournament.,23,,
174,0.97,968.267,969.501,The exposure that that got.,23,,
175,0.97,969.501,971.937,It was actually kind of baffling to see that.,23,,
176,0.97,971.937,984.717,"So you know, I just want to thank everybody and really my job for rise above is really sharing the message and sharing the sacrifices that the women before us made so we have this opportunity.",23,,
177,0.97,984.717,993.092,So I have the opportunity to go to Illinois state and get my education for free using sport and getting into college.,23,,
178,0.97,993.092,999.298,So my job is really to educate our kids and really change the narrative for our native youth.,23,,

190,0.97,1031.897,1035.834,"Thank you so much, Jenny and Jackie for being here.",26,,
191,0.97,1035.834,1050.349,This is really inspiring to hear your own stories and really to see your part of history and turning this Title nine effort into like--seeing the reality of it imagined for all of us.,26,,
192,0.97,1050.349,1052.151,I think it's really important.,26,,
193,0.97,1052.151,1056.822,As the mom of an Eleven-Year- old girl who loves to go to the storm games.,26,,
194,0.97,1056.822,1058.924,Loves to watch the OL rain.,26,,
195,0.97,1058.924,1081.413,"To know that she and other girls in the city and across the country have that student and can see themselves training, playing, using athletics as a way to advance, to go to college, it's just really important to see and really happy to recognize all of that today.",26,,
196,0.97,1081.413,1086.552,"And I will say, I think, as has been eluded to all ready, there's still work to do.",26,,
197,0.97,1086.552,1092.891,And I think helping young women get to college to be able to play at that level is great.,26,,
198,0.97,1092.891,1096.762,"Once they're there, we also need to make sure they're protected.",26,,
199,0.97,1096.762,1102.067,And that they are not taken advantage of in those settings.,26,,
200,0.97,1102.067,1103.202,More work to do.,26,,
201,0.97,1103.202,1107.039,But really happy for both of you and for all the young women that you've inspired.,26,,

205,0.97,1116.081,1119.451,Is there anybody else that would like to make comments before we close?,27,,
206,0.97,1119.451,1121.487,I have a lot to say.,27,,
207,0.97,1121.487,1125.19,But we have a big calendar.,27,,
208,0.97,1125.19,1130.496,Seeing Indian country made the Nba and knowing how it's all connected.,27,,
209,0.97,1130.496,1138.904,"And seeing coach Lenny, this is just such a wonderful day for me, all the people that I love and care about who I've watched grow community.",27,,
210,0.97,1138.904,1140.005,Jenny is partly of that.,27,,
211,0.97,1140.005,1141.94,Jackie is part of that.,27,,
212,0.97,1141.94,1168.667,"Rise above and Wnba but the more deeper personal feeling for me is because it's the 50th anniversary of title nine and like Jen any was saying it isn't just about sports and I still think it's unfortunate that it's 2022 and we still have to fight harder just like the women's soccer team did to have equal pay, to have equal access, to have the same opportunities that our Brothers get.",27,,
213,0.97,1168.667,1178.61,"The Statistics I was looking at, if I'm wrong, please correct me, girls drop out at a 50% higher rate before they're 12 than boys.",28,,
214,0.97,1178.61,1179.711,I can go on and on.,28,,
215,0.97,1179.711,1183.382,But the point is we never encourage our young girls.,28,,
216,0.97,1183.382,1193.392,We need to use their bodies for strength and be proud of it that it isn't just about the male gaze and being sexualized.,28,,
217,0.97,1193.392,1195.494,I'm just going to say it.,28,,
218,0.97,1195.494,1199.498,That's my biggest problem with today.,28,,
219,0.97,1199.498,1207.072,Nothing wrong with the Kardashians but I want women to use their minds and bodies and be proud of it.,28,,
220,0.97,1207.072,1211.843,"When I see the final four, I'm always Texting with Jackie like I could have done that shot.",28,,
221,0.97,1211.843,1215.514,I'm so proud to see women out there doing that.,28,,
222,0.97,1215.514,1219.518,When I saw sue bird play in climate pledge.,28,,
223,0.97,1219.518,1221.32,That was just amazing.,28,,
224,0.97,1221.32,1226.592,"To see the Seattle storm on a big, real, in the city of Seattle court was amazing.",28,,
225,0.97,1226.592,1233.165,Watching sue do her last game in New York with that last shot literally brought tears to my eyes.,28,,
226,0.97,1233.165,1235.334,I'm probably getting emotional here.,28,,
227,0.97,1235.334,1241.94,"But my point is, if that inspires me at 63, imagine what it does for a 14-year-old girl watching that.",28,,
228,0.97,1241.94,1244.009,Saying I can do that for a living.,28,,
229,0.97,1244.009,1245.611,That's how the world should work.,28,,
230,0.97,1245.611,1254.419,"Thank you, Jackie, thank you, Jenny, thank you for your contribution, your hard work, I know how hard both of you work behind the scenes to advance women's sports.",28,,
231,0.97,1254.419,1255.354,To advance women empowerment.,28,,
232,0.97,1255.354,1261.126,"To work with young women and young men and for that, I will always be thankful.",28,,
233,0.97,1261.994,1262.527,Thank you.,29,,
234,0.97,1262.527,1263.028,Thank you.,29,,

286,0.97,1541.706,1563.995,"This County inquest process going on today, which had been opposed by the city of Seattle is the last possible small measure of justice currently offered by those with political power since all other avenues were denied to Lyle's family by the city W. the internal SPD investigations deeming the murder lawful and proper and the OPA not bothering to investigate.",37,,

320,0.97,1761.626,1774.739,It's offensive to celebrate a time of evil racism that Treaded on native Americans only to want to preserve that time with reminders of the buildings used to enforce an economy that discriminated against locals.,43,,
