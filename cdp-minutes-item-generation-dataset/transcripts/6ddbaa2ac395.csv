95,0.97,663.095,679.111,"If we want a safer city we need to Reallocate funding out of the jail and out of SPD and actually get the money to create true infrastructure, community safety, and mental health support, care, and housing.",17,,

108,0.97,750.483,756.288,The legislation you should consideration today would move us backwards.,19,,
109,0.97,756.288,769.835,"I will also note that the idea of moving nonviolent response out of the SPD is not something we have forgotten, and keeping those responders within SPD, even though they are Civilianized would be a mistake.",19,,
110,0.97,769.835,786.085,"As soon as you are not looking, they will just move officers to more deadly positions as they did with the community response group and take more officers away from the services that are actually helping people.",19,,

120,0.97,826.091,838.737,I'm urging Y'all not to pass the resolution for hiring going for SPD or Herbold's legislation for new officers and hires and Recruiters.,21,,
121,0.97,838.737,839.638,It's rooted in Antiblackism and racism.,21,,
122,0.97,839.638,846.278,I'm a black woman and my family has been in Seattle for three generations.,21,,
123,0.97,846.278,860.092,"I have been demanding for our city to invest in the community, and why should we continue to invest in the system, filled with the lack of accountability.",21,,
124,0.97,860.092,870.97,"Residents are displaced, unable to afford child care, and Y'all keep talking about the cops leaving the force, but no one is talking about the fear they put in black folks like myself.",21,,
125,0.97,870.97,877.343,"I have seen them beat residents, and we are running out of options for black folks like me.",21,,
126,0.97,877.343,887.453,It appears many of the White residents calling in asking for Y'all to invest truly don't care.,21,,
127,0.97,887.453,888.888,The bonuses waste valuable resources.,21,,
128,0.97,888.888,895.227,Salary has not been a primary reason given for officers leaving the Department.,21,,
129,0.97,895.227,910.209,"Some of Y'all on the city council claim to care about your community, you can expand the funding for grants like creative justice, the action coalition, and community Passageways.",21,,

131,0.97,920.252,928.394,It's time to stop investing in failed strategies.,21,,
132,0.97,928.394,934.8,Investing in mental health crisis response with a professional and affordable housing is much more Affective.,21,,

144,0.97,1002.701,1006.372,We don't have enough officers to keep us safe.,23,,
145,0.97,1006.372,1012.945,This resolution provides an additional tool to quickly bring more officers on to the force.,23,,
146,0.97,1012.945,1018.55,The staffing incentive program will allow Seattle to be competitive in attracting a good pool of applicants.,23,,
147,0.97,1018.55,1034.767,"It will allow us to be more selective in hiring exceptional officers and those who reflect Seattle's diverse community, preferably Multilingual and community oriented.",23,,

160,0.97,1093.192,1098.263,"You say you believe in data, but only when it matches what you want.",25,,
161,0.97,1098.263,1115.114,"In your statement of legislative intent you say the report recommended alternative response options should be developed for the 70% of calls for services that do not require law enforcement response, but you don't like that, so you allow SPD to get another report done.",25,,
162,0.97,1115.114,1121.453,"You want alternatives, but you can't move money out of SPD until the alternatives are shown to be successful.",25,,
163,0.97,1121.453,1126.992,It's clear the public safety strategy of giving hundreds of millions of dollars to SPD is not working.,25,,
164,0.97,1126.992,1130.262,What are you doing?,25,,
165,0.97,1130.262,1131.864,Giving them more money.,25,,
166,0.97,1131.864,1136.468,Please explain why more money will change anything.,25,,
167,0.97,1136.468,1141.273,The budget is larger than most country's military budgets.,25,,
168,0.97,1141.273,1142.641,Policing makes us less safe.,25,,
169,0.97,1142.641,1160.025,"Today is an opportunity to stop wasting the city's money and extract the salary savings from SPD to invest in a true public safety such as meeting basic needs like housing, health care, mental health care, and all of the things that we all consider to have every day to live in a safe environment.",25,,
170,0.97,1160.025,1160.492,I yield my time.,25,,

175,0.97,1187.452,1191.323,It's outrageous that Council has committed funding to George Sorro's Institute.,27,,
176,0.97,1191.323,1207.639,Why is the Mayor and police chief and judges allow the entire police and justice system to be turned over to the agenda of the Institute and another funded group known as the National constitute of criminal justice reform.,27,,
177,0.97,1207.639,1214.713,They are not qualified or trustworthy.,27,,
178,0.97,1214.713,1232.764,"Thanks to city council for being--yet city council is responsible for why low-level dollar drug pushers of crack, Meth, and heroin are exempt from jail this is all related to the Junky-Seeking property crimes.",27,,
179,0.97,1232.764,1245.41,"What's the point in having city council in charge when they put an out-of-state, evil, liberal, nonprofit in charge of all levels of public safety and justice reform?",27,,
180,0.97,1245.41,1254.252,"You're endangering the innocent lives, going out of your way to keep the evil criminals conducting war on the community out of jail.",27,,
181,0.97,1254.252,1257.689,You're undermining the integrity of police reform and safety.,27,,
182,0.97,1257.689,1265.697,The only people you have made it safe for from the institution is the actual criminals.,27,,
183,0.97,1265.697,1275.207,I can't believe how Cowardous our media is on our failed leadership that has not improved any aspect of our unsafe society.,27,,
184,0.97,1275.207,1276.408,Have some decency and resign.,27,,
185,0.97,1276.408,1287.185,"This is a volunteer public service job, yet you act like you're doing us a favor by staying in office.",27,,
186,0.97,1287.185,1293.759,Your agenda is to protect criminals who hate police and innocent white citizens.,27,,
187,0.97,1293.759,1294.826,You encourage them.,27,,
188,0.97,1294.826,1300.766,You have purposely undermined civilization --,27,,

192,0.97,1312.911,1321.319,"My name is Michael Malini Renter in district three, call for the Council to vote against the hiring bonuses for SPD.",29,,
193,0.97,1321.319,1329.227,More police bonuses does not get at the root causes of the problems Referenced.,29,,

203,0.97,1360.358,1365.597,"I understand public safety is a huge concern, especially for people like me in North Seattle.",31,,
204,0.97,1365.597,1370.202,There's no data to show that increasing hiring bonuses would increase the complications.,31,,
205,0.97,1370.202,1387.853,There's a lot of data to show that stable housing and financial stability does decrease issues thus greatly increasing public safety and the quality of life for residents.,31,,
206,0.97,1387.853,1392.491,We could House over 100 people for an entire year with the money.,31,,
207,0.97,1392.491,1408.607,"I'm absolutely in alignment that more needs to be done for public safety, but let's make Data-Driven decisions for all people, not just the people with the unearned privilege who live where I live and look like I look.",31,,
208,0.97,1408.607,1411.843,"Let's keep going and making a Data-Driven decision, and vote no on the measure.",31,,

217,0.97,1441.873,1452.25,"The city of Seattle is facing a dangerous shortage of sworn officers, and at a time when crimes and especially violent crimes are on the rise.",33,,
218,0.97,1452.25,1459.291,The situation does not properly protect the citizens of Seattle nor those coming to visit our city.,33,,
219,0.97,1459.291,1463.595,Efforts to hire and retain officers has been slow and unsuccessful.,33,,
220,0.97,1463.595,1473.672,"Only 13 new officers have been hired rather than the 40 anticipated, and there's been 43 officers resign, rather than 24 expected.",33,,
221,0.97,1473.672,1479.811,Residents had a clear message for city elected officials through the election that public safety must be the top priority.,33,,
222,0.97,1479.811,1483.548,We have continued to send the message through surveys and other channels as well.,33,,
223,0.97,1483.548,1492.357,"While we realize that our city needs other services for the homeless and those in crisis, we do not believe that reducing the police staff is the solution.",33,,
224,0.97,1492.357,1499.297,"In fact, these people are most vulnerable to the criminal Enterprises operating throughout the city.",33,,
225,0.97,1499.297,1507.339,We must do more to attract our highly qualified officers and requiring transparency and accountability from SPD.,33,,
226,0.97,1507.339,1517.549,"To get the best candidates, we must be prepared for bonuses as part of a total compensation package.",33,,
227,0.97,1517.549,1522.12,Other regions are seeking hires from the same shrinking talent pool.,33,,
228,0.97,1522.12,1529.227,"Anyone responsible for human resources knows that what employees value most in order of importance are respect, recognition, and reward.",33,,
229,0.97,1529.227,1532.13,It's time we treat our police officers as valued employees.,33,,
230,0.97,1532.13,1541.706,I encourage each of you to honor the message that voters set last fall about the importance of public safety in our city and support resolution 32050.,33,,
231,0.97,1541.706,1541.94,Thank you.,33,,
232,0.97,1546.077,1549.214,Thank you.,34,,
233,0.97,1549.214,1555.186,That is the last Speaker that is showing up as present.,34,,
234,0.97,1555.186,1564.095,With that we will end public comment and move on to the items on the agenda.,34,,
235,0.97,1564.095,1572.237,"Clerk, will you please read in item number one.",34,,
236,0.97,1572.237,1576.641,"Item number one, response to legislative intense Spd-017-A- 001 for briefing and discussion.",35,,
237,0.97,1576.641,1578.243,Thank you so much.,36,,
238,0.97,1578.243,1582.547,I will start us here.,36,,
239,0.97,1582.547,1607.939,"We are joined by Andrew Mayerburg and Brian Maxi, the Coo of SPD and Lauren Atherly of the Seattle police Department to provide brief background, and I will hand it over to Greg Doss on the Council central staff in August of 2020, the Council first requested SPD undertake a 911 call response analysis.",36,,
240,0.97,1607.939,1623.855,"In October of that year, 2020, the former Mayor issued an executive order to identify the areas of SPD response that can be Transitioned to civilian and Community-Based response.",36,,
241,0.97,1623.855,1636.001,"That's, you know, that's work that was started almost two years ago now, looking at August 2020.",36,,
242,0.97,1636.001,1646.711,Last year the Seattle police Department commissioned a report from the National Institute for criminal justice reform to analyze the 911 call types.,36,,
243,0.97,1646.711,1653.551,That report identified 174 call types as possible candidates for alternative responses.,36,,
244,0.97,1653.551,1684.315,"In a briefing here in this Committee in July of last year, the executive highlighted the fact that they agreed up to 12% of calls for service can be responded to without SPD involvement in the near term, and this is 28 of the call types that the report identified.",36,,
245,0.97,1684.315,1685.583,The report identified 174.,36,,
246,0.97,1685.583,1693.658,"Spd was not willing to go that far that all call types could be diverted, but they did agree that 28 could be.",36,,
247,0.97,1693.658,1709.174,That was July of last year that SPD agreed that 28 of the call types could be diverted they agree on those call types.,36,,
248,0.97,1709.174,1729.961,"They feel the call types could potentially be appropriate for an alternative response or on a longer time horizon or longer planning horizon in order to divert the calls, but they wanted to do more analysis, sort of a check on the report.",36,,
249,0.97,1729.961,1742.307,"In 2021, recognizing that SPD wanted to do the additional work, and Council adopted the statement of legislative intense.",36,,
250,0.97,1742.307,1754.619,"That's found on the agenda, and the statement of legislative intent requested SPD provide quarterly updates on the process of the continuing work.",36,,
251,0.97,1754.619,1759.424,"Council received the first update, again, included on the agenda.",36,,
252,0.97,1759.424,1786.818,"Before the--proceed, handing it over to Greg Doss on Council central staff to highlight, recognizing the first quarterly report does not fully capture everything that we had intended, and just for the record, I want Greg really quickly to touch on what we anticipated to be included in the record.",36,,
253,0.97,1786.818,1787.285,Good morning.,37,,
254,0.97,1787.285,1791.356,"Greg Doss, member of the central staff.",37,,
255,0.97,1791.356,1807.505,"As usual, the chair did an excellent job with background and stole much of what I would tell you, I would as she suggested go into an overview of what the slides specifically requested.",37,,
256,0.97,1807.505,1820.385,"It requested in the first quarterly report, information on the specific call types that could be handled without SPD involvement at all.",37,,
257,0.97,1820.385,1863.161,"Those include calls that SPD agreed could be Civilianized without harm to responders, including administrative responses like traffic collision reports, and it also requested SPD look at responses to low-level misdemeanor calls or where a mental health professional could take a lead role, and the officer remains on site for safety purposes, essentially looking at alternatives for 911 responses and coming back with a particular recommendation on what kinds of calls could be Civilianized.",37,,
258,0.97,1863.161,1871.803,Including the 12% of calls that SPD agreed could be Civilianized immediately and other calls.,37,,
259,0.97,1871.803,1875.44,29 call types that could be handled without SPD involvement.,37,,
260,0.97,1875.44,1896.261,"So that was the focus of the first quarterly report, and as the chair suggested, the Department came back about a month ago and said it would not be able to provide the specific Deliverables today, but would provide a report on the background and progress to date.",37,,
261,0.97,1896.261,1920.518,"I believe that's what the committee will hear, and future reports will be heard on I believe July 1 and October 1, and they will deal with the specific recommendations that SPD may make on alternative 911 response.",37,,
262,0.97,1920.518,1922.453,Those are my comments.,37,,
263,0.97,1922.453,1923.221,Available for any questions.,37,,
264,0.97,1923.221,1927.091,"Greg, I just want to thank the executive for being here with us today.",38,,
265,0.97,1927.091,1939.671,I know it's not always easy to come and talk to us when Maybe the work product might not be what we hoped.,38,,
266,0.97,1939.671,1960.124,"I recognize we have a new administration and there are a lot of, shall we say balls in the air, and really appreciate that you are here with us today because I think that signals, and I will turn it over to you to say so in your own words, but I think it signals a real commitment on the part of the executive to continue the work.",38,,
267,0.97,1960.124,1963.328,"With that, I will hand it over.",38,,
268,0.97,1963.328,1970.335,"Thank you, Councilmember, and thank you all for having us here today.",39,,
269,0.97,1970.335,1971.135,Supplementing one thing Greg said.,39,,
270,0.97,1971.135,1977.608,"The background, we are on the same page how we got here.",39,,
271,0.97,1977.608,1981.346,Spd will not make recommendations what alternatives will Rollout.,39,,
272,0.97,1981.346,1985.45,Spd is involved like a number of Stakeholders including the city council.,39,,
273,0.97,1985.45,1993.558,"What SPD will talk about today, SPD engaged in the call analysis, a risk analysis.",39,,
274,0.97,1993.558,1996.627,"It's up to us, Collaboratively to decide what calls will be shifted.",39,,
275,0.97,1996.627,2006.304,"I want to be clear about that, verses the work we are doing collectively together.",39,,
276,0.97,2006.304,2023.02,"With that, I will turn it over to both Brian and Lauren to talk about what the project is and what the output is we are hoping to get from it, and how it can compliment the work done and the time line generally.",39,,
277,0.97,2023.02,2026.591,"Brian and Lauren, would you mind going from here?",39,,
278,0.97,2026.591,2029.727,"No, thank you very much, director.",40,,
279,0.97,2029.727,2030.895,I'm just going to kick this off.,40,,
280,0.97,2030.895,2036.334,"My want, I will get out of the way of the math.",40,,
281,0.97,2036.334,2044.075,I believe that will be the center of piece of the presentation today.,40,,
282,0.97,2044.075,2053.418,Really what we are trying to do is understand the complexity of the questions asked of us in terms of public safety.,40,,
283,0.97,2053.418,2058.79,As you know the SPD data ANALYTICS is far more advanced than people give us credit for.,40,,
284,0.97,2058.79,2086.384,"A month ago, we were at Harvard presenting some of the results on the Eaq and Rmb systems at Harvard to people who were very receptive, using advanced ANALYTICS to understand the public safety problems.",40,,
285,0.97,2086.384,2091.122,"The report that called for the appropriate civilian response, honestly and directly, we take issue with it.",40,,
286,0.97,2091.122,2106.471,"We don't believe it was a responsible analysis, and they did not take into account many of the variables that are critically important to safely navigating the calls.",40,,
287,0.97,2106.471,2117.014,"The 12% we discussed last summer, I don't want to call it the back of the envelope analysis, but it was far less sophisticated than the approach we are taking right now.",40,,
288,0.97,2117.014,2136.534,"It was the best guess, and I certainly believe there are some Low-Hanging fruit calls that should and could be transferred to civilian response as soon as practical, but Lauren will present the methodology for understanding at much more granular and responsible level what can and should be done.",40,,
289,0.97,2136.534,2142.773,"With that, again, I will get out of the way and turn it over to Lauren.",40,,
290,0.97,2142.773,2146.611,Does Lauren have the ability to share his screen for the presentation?,40,,
291,0.97,2146.611,2159.39,I don't know that was provided to Council prior to today.,40,,
292,0.97,2159.39,2160.658,"Alex, you with us?",40,,
293,0.97,2160.658,2161.626,Can Lauren do that?,40,,
294,0.97,2161.626,2164.562,It looks like I can.,41,,
295,0.97,2164.562,2166.13,Can everyone see that?,41,,
296,0.97,2166.13,2166.397,Yeah.,42,,
297,0.97,2166.397,2166.564,,43,,
298,0.97,2166.564,2169.233,Thank you for having me.,44,,
299,0.97,2169.233,2178.109,I promise to keep the math short and keep this from a math logical perspective.,44,,
300,0.97,2178.109,2202.233,"Just sort of a matter to practically set the stage here, you know, in addition to the response of the body of work being complex, the math is inherently Nonlinear.",44,,
301,0.97,2202.233,2218.482,"From a practical standpoint, alternating the calls to a differential police response and also the Operationallization of that or the practical implications for Routeing to an alternate response.",44,,
302,0.97,2218.482,2222.42,Both are challenging pieces to the analysis.,44,,
303,0.97,2222.42,2227.959,"Just really quick, I will go through the rough background on the differential police response.",44,,
304,0.97,2227.959,2246.644,"The history dates for 50 years or so, talking about the principles of risk management, which we are adopting here from other industries who have used the approach for managing risks.",44,,
305,0.97,2246.644,2266.497,That's severity and likelihood of the events and making high- level decisions and how it leads to the concept.,44,,
306,0.97,2266.497,2277.174,"Broadly speaking, policing as a function of sort of a broader municipal services has been attempting to find the value for differential response since about the late 1950s.",44,,
307,0.97,2277.174,2291.622,Some of this really kind of came to fruition in the late 1970s with the Wilmington split half experiment and then the police experiment in the 1980s.,44,,
308,0.97,2291.622,2301.932,"All of that generally speaking has run into a roadblock at the Psac, the public safety answering point.",44,,
309,0.97,2301.932,2309.707,Mostly because it's very difficult to tell from what is being described just exactly what people are dealing with.,44,,
310,0.97,2309.707,2315.112,"That's the general limitation behind the report, it deals with perfect information.",44,,
311,0.97,2315.112,2320.751,The perfect service is confirmed after we take an all hazard Responder.,44,,
312,0.97,2320.751,2331.796,"It's in proximity to the call or the service being requested, and they can confirm and right size the response.",44,,
313,0.97,2331.796,2344.508,"Up until now, the data and understanding of the general risk profile is, and it can be visualized and accepted as a matter of public policy, and it's been limited.",44,,
314,0.97,2344.508,2357.722,"In recent years, the volume of the data collected, and the ability to process it as made a differential police response.",44,,
315,0.97,2357.722,2363.094,I mean the alternate response possible.,44,,
316,0.97,2363.094,2372.737,"Broadly speaking, the literature behind this in particular, it's about 1200 publications between 1954 and 2020.",44,,
317,0.97,2372.737,2376.307,Clusters into sort of four general areas of focus.,44,,
318,0.97,2376.307,2381.479,"Two have general police response, and that's fundamentally where we are focused.",44,,
319,0.97,2381.479,2382.246,That's the bulk of calls.,44,,
320,0.97,2382.246,2406.27,"I would also like to highlight that the industry is advanced in taking a more sensitive approach to specific problems that are a little more easily identifiable from the way the call presents, like people with mental illness verses mental illness and partner violence.",44,,
321,0.97,2406.27,2415.946,"Again, all of these alternate response modes are dependent on diagnosing what the call is or identifying it confidential at the outset.",44,,
322,0.97,2415.946,2426.056,"So speaking a little bit from a risk management perspective, there's a lot of industries that do highly--engage in highly risky activities.",44,,

347,0.97,2719.149,2728.592,What we will do with the analysis once the data is in the final state is actually look for a natural clustering of the data.,44,,
348,0.97,2728.592,2731.228,There's two approaches to categorizing risk.,44,,
349,0.97,2731.228,2761.191,"You can take a policy perspective, and gathering information based on what the sort of Conceptional risk is to the organization and what is acceptable to decision makers and policymakers, and alternatively, you can look for natural clusters in the data where these things break out into a natural category or distinct response.",44,,
350,0.97,2761.191,2793.857,"We will force four factor or five factor principle component to see where we see the natural clusters mathematically, and they translate into the simple definitions to be engaged broadly by the Stakeholders, community partners, leadership, and by response organizations, because, part of the struggle, generally speaking in Onboarding Coresponses is in providing enough information to the Coresponse bodies to allow them to accept the risk as well.",44,,
351,0.97,2793.857,2816.313,"They need some sense for what the risk profile is that they are accepting for their employees or responders or volunteers, and this would translate the risk concept both as a multidimensional risk matrix as I identified and will show you here in a simulation shortly, and also in terms of simple definitions.",44,,
352,0.97,2816.313,2828.525,"Very likely 1 out of every 10,000 responses or approximately 90 a year, all the way up to very unlikely, 1 out of every 2.7 million responses.",44,,

354,0.97,2837.568,2841.305,It's a little difficult to kind of Conceptualize those things in your head.,44,,

358,0.97,2873.971,2879.309,It's what the first stage of the analysis looks like.,44,,

360,0.97,2910.741,2918.015,It's easier to wrap your head around the response tiers than the response types.,44,,
361,0.97,2918.015,2922.319,We have taken the Four-Tier response from the NIC Jr.,44,,
362,0.97,2922.319,2935.432,"Report and reverse coded it for the conventional use call priority, and tier one is the highest risk top of event we respond to, and four is the lowest type.",44,,

366,0.97,2954.985,2962.592,"As reflected in the simulated risk matrix seen there, that's projected to be a relatively small volume of calls.",44,,
367,0.97,2962.592,2979.476,"Tier two responses would be an event that does represent an elevated risk of adverse event to responders or bystanders, and there's likely a better response alternative that can meet the needs more effectively.",44,,
368,0.97,2979.476,2996.76,"In that case, by Pairing the Coresponder with the police officer, you're effectively mitigating the risk to the Responder Ideally there, should the event evolve to a tier one response.",44,,
369,0.97,2996.76,3003.6,"Tier two, once the immediate Life-Health-Safety risk is mitigated, it would revert to three.",44,,
370,0.97,3003.6,3004.334,It's strategic and tactical.,44,,
371,0.97,3004.334,3035.799,"It has broad implications at the high level for building capacity and Resourcing appropriately the four different tier responses, and on the ground, implications for the continued contact, the initial call, and it's all the way through the final closure of the event.",44,,
372,0.97,3035.799,3037.1,With the dynamic risk mitigation.,44,,
373,0.97,3037.1,3043.006,"As soon as it's addressed, it can revert to the tier three response.",44,,
374,0.97,3043.006,3068.565,"Similarly tier three with no forecast risk to the responders may be best handled by a Coresponder with police staged nearby as we believe potentially police can escalate an event, but you want them to respond rapidly should the event turn out to be something else once the responders arrive and can make a better assessment of what is being reported.",44,,
375,0.97,3068.565,3094.391,"Tier four responses are actually kind of the going back to the original differential police response concept, and they are what was attempted to be realized in the 1980s, and that is where appointments, Walkup counters, and basically technology has evolved for us.",44,,

377,0.97,3111.108,3116.379,There's no sort of forecast or acceptable risk to bystanders or immediate need.,44,,

386,0.97,3193.056,3193.557,Really appreciate that.,45,,
387,0.97,3193.557,3208.605,And also want to go back to something that the director said about the--the recommendations will not purely SPD's recommendations.,45,,
388,0.97,3208.605,3226.156,I understand that folks are meeting with central staff this week to discuss that collaboration and ongoing executive processes including sort of this internal work group on this analysis.,45,,
389,0.97,3226.156,3230.193,Do I understand correctly that is something that is happening?,45,,
390,0.97,3230.193,3234.564,We meet with central staff today.,46,,
391,0.97,3234.564,3235.098,Great.,47,,
392,0.97,3235.098,3239.035,I'm optimistic what will come forward on that process piece.,47,,
393,0.97,3239.035,3248.178,"I think it will be very, very helpful to us on the Council in that work moving forward.",47,,
394,0.97,3248.178,3257.721,"I do see there's questions there, and I just want to get baseline understanding before I open up to questions.",47,,
395,0.97,3257.721,3276.773,"Is it an accurate description of this analysis, Risk-Managed analysis to say the purpose is to analyze the NIC Jr. study of the 911 calls as originally dispatched, the events that transpired during the call, and the ending or final call type recorded in the CAD or Rms.",47,,
396,0.97,3276.773,3286.549,"If so, can you just state in a couple of full sentences what didn't happen with the NIC Jr.",47,,
397,0.97,3286.549,3289.119,Analysis that you're doing?,47,,
398,0.97,3289.119,3289.886,"Yeah, absolutely.",48,,
399,0.97,3289.886,3292.422,So I would say that the NIC Jr.,48,,
400,0.97,3292.422,3297.594,"Analysis is a good rough cut, but it's based in perfect information.",48,,
401,0.97,3297.594,3302.065,It's based in what we know to be the disposition of the event.,48,,
402,0.97,3302.065,3307.103,It's really only confirmed after the Responder arrives at it.,48,,
403,0.97,3307.103,3327.624,"The analysis here, the concept of both incorporating the data not available to the analysis, the adverse outcomes, and there's a one to many relationship between those, and also it sort of evolves the concept of better understanding what it takes to implement it.",48,,
404,0.97,3327.624,3333.596,The NIC Jr. analysis from a high-level perspective is a great way to enter the conversation.,48,,
405,0.97,3333.596,3364.527,"Once the events have evolved themselves, they land in the buckets you can roughly say that eventually didn't end up needing a police Responder, but the trick in this is being able to forecast, and not predict, but being able to forecast in terms of supporting human decision making at the various stages, a long call processing, and what the event may turn out to be so we can right size the response, from the perspective of the Evidence-Based policing referred to as the Goldilocks policing.",48,,
406,0.97,3364.527,3377.207,"What we need to determine in this case is what is necessary to assist the spectrum of response, and that continual response, being able to Right- size the response --",48,,
407,0.97,3377.207,3380.51,Didn't your report only look at the original call type?,49,,
408,0.97,3380.51,3384.013,Now are you looking at everything that happened afterwards?,49,,
409,0.97,3384.013,3387.117,Is that the bottom line?,49,,
410,0.97,3387.117,3388.518,Correct.,50,,
411,0.97,3388.518,3389.385,"Okay, thank you.",51,,

414,0.97,3392.989,3438.635,"I appreciate the presentation, but I just want to ask a couple of questions about the steps forward and when we can expect to start seeing Maybe some kind of substance on the street pilot to start doing some of the work, and I appreciate the letter that was sent along on April 26th from chief Diaz, but I want to clarify something they just don't understand or two years of having the meetings and talking about this, that the chief in the second paragraph of the letter, in the community record, indicating 97% of all calls received are different than initially classified.",53,,
415,0.97,3438.635,3441.237,It's not possible to accurately predict the outcome of every call.,53,,
416,0.97,3441.237,3463.96,"I appreciate given the current system that's where we are, but what I just don't understand, and maybe I can get an answer from someone on the panel here today is Denver, Colorado, has been doing this for two years.",53,,
417,0.97,3463.96,3481.077,"Denver, Colorado, has been responding to 2,700 calls without any incident or problem dispatched through 911, and they have been able to figure out a way to triage them during the calls.",53,,
418,0.97,3481.077,3484.28,Did they go through the similar data analysis project like this?,53,,
419,0.97,3484.28,3495.592,Why haven't I heard from any of the panels over the last two years like a site visit or analysis or assessment or discussion with anyone from Denver about how they respond to these calls?,53,,
420,0.97,3495.592,3515.211,"I feel like whenever we have a presentation like this, it's like, you know, we have no conception on how a major city can respond differently, but there's a major city with a similar population and demographics to Seattle, and they have been responding to the calls for two years.",53,,
421,0.97,3515.211,3520.483,"They are expanding now to 10,000 calls per year.",53,,
422,0.97,3520.483,3527.123,"I am just curious, like have there been discussions with what Denver is doing that allows them to do the work?",53,,
423,0.97,3527.123,3530.994,What are they doing that we are missing?,53,,
424,0.97,3530.994,3534.264,Is this assessment and analysis going to get us there?,53,,
425,0.97,3534.264,3536.399,Are we following their example?,53,,
426,0.97,3536.399,3540.47,What--like how can we learn from the city that is doing the work?,53,,
427,0.97,3540.47,3542.639,I guess that's my question.,53,,
428,0.97,3542.639,3547.176,"I can answer that, and I will shift over to Brian as well.",54,,
429,0.97,3547.176,3563.259,"He has done the Backgrounding on Denver, and part of what we are up to right now, and part of the work we will be doing with central staff and internally with the work group, deep dive research into the different programs across the country, Denver being one of them.",54,,

431,0.97,3563.96,3575.838,There's a number of programs that exist in other jurisdictions we want to examine and research and understand how they work and what criteria that use to dispatch calls.,54,,
432,0.97,3575.838,3576.205,That's ongoing.,54,,
433,0.97,3576.205,3584.047,"What I can't speak to is what has been done over the last couple of years, but I can speak to what has been done since January.",54,,
434,0.97,3584.047,3604.067,"I don't mean to push the question, but we are working very Vigilantly with a broad swath of the Department heads, folks, and others in central staff to develop exactly the understanding you're developing, if possible, to pivot to pilot.",54,,

436,0.97,3604.667,3605.902,Wouldn't that be the positive?,55,,
437,0.97,3605.902,3607.37,Shouldn't that be the first thing we do?,55,,
438,0.97,3607.37,3614.51,Like go and look at the peer city to see how they are doing the thing we want to do?,55,,
439,0.97,3614.51,3617.146,That's what I just don't understand.,55,,
440,0.97,3617.146,3624.954,"I guess from my perspective, it's an important decision point to know about what someone else does, but I'm not sure it's this positive.",56,,
441,0.97,3624.954,3632.161,I'm not sure how Denver and how they are doing their thing should dictate how Seattle does it.,56,,
442,0.97,3632.161,3637.634,"It's relative information, but it's not positive to how we will roll out our resources.",56,,
443,0.97,3637.634,3647.61,"Brian, I don't know if you can talk about Denver, but as far as they have more resources for mental health providers responding to calls, like in the 50s.",56,,
444,0.97,3647.61,3654.45,"Again, it's a little bit of a different framework than what we have in the current structure in Seattle.",56,,
445,0.97,3654.45,3659.255,I think it's on the table of things we can consider and something we are interested in.,56,,
446,0.97,3659.255,3662.759,Denver has been the model we think has worked thus far.,56,,
447,0.97,3662.759,3668.297,I think we want it to be part of the work.,56,,
448,0.97,3668.297,3672.301,We want the data analysis and,56,,

465,0.97,3776.939,3781.244,In Denver they have 32 mental health providers to Corespond with police.,62,,
466,0.97,3781.244,3797.527,"To what Lauren was talking about, the variability of whether the police will take the lead in the given situation or the mental health provider will take the lead in the given situation, determined by the associated risk and the situation on the ground.",62,,
467,0.97,3797.527,3801.364,They did not do a formal risk assessment like we are doing.,62,,
468,0.97,3801.364,3813.776,"We are definitely pushing the envelope of trying to create a mature system here, which will hopefully allow for the transfer of more calls.",62,,
469,0.97,3813.776,3821.117,"They have a small, discreet set of calls.",62,,
470,0.97,3821.117,3828.991,"They did work with their Psap, the 911 call center, to develop protocols to dig deeper into the incoming calls.",62,,
471,0.97,3828.991,3836.866,"I know Cscc is working on the protocols to help them determine the risk, too.",62,,
472,0.97,3836.866,3840.303,There's a parallel effort there they cannot speak to directly.,62,,
473,0.97,3840.303,3842.305,I believe it's underway at Cscc.,62,,
474,0.97,3842.305,3847.376,"Yes, we are working with Star, and yes we have met with them.",62,,
475,0.97,3847.376,3849.412,We do understand their system.,62,,
476,0.97,3849.412,3859.956,There are some Low-Hanging fruit calls we believe could be transferred to the Csos if we could get through the labor issues associated with that.,62,,
477,0.97,3859.956,3870.099,We are trying to get to a more comprehensive and mature response.,62,,
478,0.97,3870.099,3876.973,"To walk back something I referred earlier, the NIC Jr.",62,,
479,0.97,3876.973,3880.209,Report referred to as irresponsible.,62,,
480,0.97,3880.209,3881.21,Incomplete is a better word.,62,,
481,0.97,3881.21,3887.049,I meant wholesale adoption of that would be irresponsible for the city of Seattle.,62,,
482,0.97,3887.049,3889.685,"A brief Followup, Madam chair, very brief.",63,,
483,0.97,3889.685,3890.353,I appreciate the overview.,64,,
484,0.97,3890.353,3900.83,I'm glad that the Department and the Mayor's office are looking at an existing program.,64,,
485,0.97,3900.83,3910.373,"I would say I think there's a certain practicality in examining the existing functioning model in a peer city, even if it's not completely responsive.",64,,
486,0.97,3910.373,3915.478,It's just something I think is an important context for the otherwise Data-Driven system.,64,,
487,0.97,3915.478,3927.023,I would feel more comfortable doing something that is based on something being successful somewhere else than you know completely something being conceived from the ground up.,64,,
488,0.97,3927.023,3936.866,I also just want to--like Brian you said something that does not completely accord with my understanding from the Star program that maybe we could look into to clarify.,64,,
489,0.97,3936.866,3954.65,"My understanding is that from the 2700 calls the pilot did, the Department in Denver identified 2, 294 of those would have been responded to by police otherwise.",64,,
490,0.97,3954.65,3961.49,I don't think it's purely sort of doing functions that are akin to what the mid may do.,64,,
491,0.97,3961.49,3967.83,"I don't think it's just cleaning up needles or doing, you know, distributing bottled water or something.",64,,
492,0.97,3967.83,3978.474,"I think they are responding to things that Denver police was responding to before, and that's definitely part of the plan to scale it to annual 10,000 calls a year.",64,,
493,0.97,3978.474,3991.22,"The last thing I--I would like us to check into that because, I mean I obviously don't know that for a fact, but that's what I have seen reported and indicated in their data.",64,,
494,0.97,3991.22,4002.298,The other thing I would say is they have heard a very large amount of entrepreneurial interest from different provider organizations in doing something like this in Seattle.,64,,
495,0.97,4002.298,4008.771,"Maybe that's not been getting through, kind of to the Mayor's office.",64,,
496,0.97,4008.771,4024.387,I could maybe transmit a couple of the leads for consideration to be integrated into how the executive side folks are thinking of this and maybe getting Proffers in what the implementation vision would look like from the people who have reached out.,64,,
497,0.97,4024.387,4031.527,The last thing I would say to share they found interesting.,64,,
498,0.97,4031.527,4041.937,"In Denver, where they do have, you know, a maturing response alternative, they have been losing fewer police from attrition.",64,,
499,0.97,4041.937,4047.109,"I mean, everyone is losing police through attrition, but Denver is losing fewer.",64,,
500,0.97,4047.109,4052.548,"In 2019, Denver lost 100 officers.",64,,
501,0.97,4052.548,4058.521,"In 2020, generally a high-water mark for departures, they lost 81.",64,,
502,0.97,4058.521,4061.357,That's fewer than in 2019.,64,,
503,0.97,4061.357,4063.726,I think it's an interesting look at the attrition Dynamics.,64,,
504,0.97,4063.726,4066.862,I don't know what to attribute it to.,64,,
505,0.97,4066.862,4069.698,I found it to be an interesting correlation.,64,,
506,0.97,4069.698,4074.67,"In any event, I appreciate that it's something that is being looked at.",64,,
507,0.97,4074.67,4084.38,"I will share some of the resources, Brian, with you and Andrew, the people who have expressed local interest and appreciate there's interest from the panel.",64,,
508,0.97,4084.38,4084.847,Thank you so much.,64,,
509,0.97,4088.35,4089.585,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",65,,
510,0.97,4089.585,4094.223,"Before we move over to Councilmember Mosqueda, Greg, did you have something to add here?",65,,
511,0.97,4094.223,4094.89,"Yeah, I did.",66,,
512,0.97,4094.89,4124.153,"I wanted to follow up a bit with what Councilmember Lewis was asking, and to say that when looking at programs and services they offer, you know, I think it's true that there are services that are picked up in the community that police officers are not doing now, but there are also services that are being picked up that police officers would have to do, and I think that's a point that Councilmember Lewis is making.",66,,
513,0.97,4124.153,4131.494,I think you see that nowhere better than in Eugene with Kahoots.,66,,
514,0.97,4131.494,4158.42,"In Kahoots, you have mental health providers responding to not CSO administrator types, but you have people who are trained in mental and behavioral health responding to a person down and wellness check calls, and they have been for 30 some years, calls that have not been going to Eugene police that otherwise would have been going to Eugene police and would go to Eugene police.",66,,
515,0.97,4158.42,4189.351,"I think what you can see there is an evaluation of a program where you have to take the other considerations into factor, and you have to factor in the other considerations, and it's important to say that you can alleviate the stress from police with alternative response, and that, in deed, they are picking up services police would have to go to.",66,,
516,0.97,4189.351,4195.791,I just want to echo Councilmember Lewis' responses with that experience in Kahoots.,66,,
517,0.97,4195.791,4196.525,"Thank you, Greg.",67,,
518,0.97,4196.525,4226.155,"Councilmember Mosqueda, just wrapping up this train of thought here before moving on to you, I do just want to flag that we do have the downtown emergency service centers mobile crisis teams that currently are not being dispatched from 911, but they respond to when first responders call them, and that, I think, is a really good example of a local program that could potentially be dispatched from 911.",67,,
519,0.97,4226.155,4286.782,"I also want to--thank you, Brian, for recognizing one of the lessons learned thus far after the work that has been done is that the ability of either Csos or the county's emergency service patrol to tackle some Subset of the priority three calls and just want to recognize they think a little bit of a difference of philosophy here about whether or not we do--we do the full on analysis or whether or not we work to try to do some Low- hanging fruit, things we all agree can be done, and we all agree is right now low risk to calls that Csos are already responding to in cases.",67,,
520,0.97,4286.782,4293.589,"Again, just they are responding because they are being called from police officers who don't need to be going to the scene in the first place.",67,,
521,0.97,4293.589,4311.106,"So really, I would like to see us sort of stage our work here, rather than waiting until we have a final product, but that's--those are conversations they know we will continue to have within the work group, so thank you.",67,,
522,0.97,4311.106,4315.611,Councilmember Mosqueda.,67,,
523,0.97,4315.611,4319.848,"Thank you very much, Madame chair.",68,,
524,0.97,4319.848,4325.454,"Thank you for the presentation, and thank you for the chair asking it to be posted publically.",68,,
525,0.97,4325.454,4327.756,Unfortunately we didn't get to dive into the details before.,68,,
526,0.97,4327.756,4328.557,Thank you for the analysis.,68,,
527,0.97,4328.557,4333.062,Know that this is a point in time of the preview of the conversations to come.,68,,
528,0.97,4333.062,4334.863,Just want to note the appreciation for you.,68,,
529,0.97,4334.863,4349.578,"I do, however, want to come back to the word that was used earlier and appreciate the clarification that has been offered, but the word irresponsible was used twice in reference to NIC Jr., and not responsible was used once.",68,,
530,0.97,4349.578,4375.27,"I feel it's important to clarify for the members of the public who may be confused about the comments that the question that the National research body--it's a research body that we have worked with, and in fact the report from the National Institute for criminal justice reform known as NI C.J.",68,,
531,0.97,4375.27,4382.211,R says the Seattle police Department contracted with Nicjr for the call for services from the period of 2017 to 2019.,68,,
532,0.97,4382.211,4387.549,"It's not just some external third party, you know entity that does not have Creditability.",68,,
533,0.97,4387.549,4400.763,"This is a group that has gone into contracts and partnerships with cities and jurisdictions like Washington, D.C., Oakland, Portland, Oregon, Indianapolis, Indiana.",68,,
534,0.97,4400.763,4415.177,They worked with an array of organizations announcing a partnership at the national level like with center for American progress to reduce gun violence and promote the use of Nonarmed officers for responses.,68,,
535,0.97,4415.177,4423.085,I think it's important to clarify the credibility that the National Institute for criminal justice has at the national level and within our own city.,68,,
536,0.97,4423.085,4448.41,"This is the first time I'm hearing a question whether or not the 12% of calls we had initially agreed could be called Offloaded to Nonarmed officers is now into question, and I think it's important for us to work towards moving forward to solutions together, and we want to make sure that we are not questioning the very entity that we have contracted with in the past.",68,,
537,0.97,4448.41,4471.266,"I think the way Lauren, for example, phrased it publically here, and the sentiment captured in the page and a half response, but the more appropriate analysis, it's a first cut, a great way to begin the conversation, and those are the two comments I really heard and do want to emphasize the important role that the National Institute for criminal justice reform should have with the analysis going forward.",68,,
538,0.97,4471.266,4483.178,"I will again ask we have a commitment to have the analysis that is currently being done, recognizing the response at the point in time, having the analysis be reviewed by a third party.",68,,
539,0.97,4483.178,4498.16,I'm concerned that there's a questioning of the credibility or the methodology that Nicjr used and we want the opportunity for the third party to provide the analysis when we complete it.,68,,
540,0.97,4498.16,4509.805,"As for the record that should be clear from the slide request, no one, especially no one on Council has been suggesting we adopt the Nicjr report in call.",68,,
541,0.97,4509.805,4514.076,"That's why we have the response, and that's why you will see more conversations it come on this.",68,,
542,0.97,4514.076,4525.32,"I want to make sure they get out there, again in the interest of having a third party do an analysis of whatever report comes forward from the internal deep dive.",68,,
543,0.97,4525.32,4533.128,"Let me say before I kick it over to Lauren, thank you, I think that's good clarification.",69,,
544,0.97,4533.128,4535.163,We appreciate it.,69,,
545,0.97,4535.163,4546.775,"No disagreement on the executive side of, you know, how reputable the organization is.",69,,
546,0.97,4546.775,4547.075,Thank you.,69,,
547,0.97,4547.075,4547.576,Councilmember Lewis?,70,,
548,0.97,4547.576,4551.179,"Thank you, so much, Madame chair.",71,,
549,0.97,4551.179,4553.048,I think it's been a good discussion today.,71,,
550,0.97,4553.048,4555.884,I appreciate we are getting into the this part of the work.,71,,
551,0.97,4555.884,4582.11,"One thing to emphasize, we have been talking about the low Acuity first response, but I don't want to lose track there's an opportunity with cost when we have SPD officers doing things that other folks can do, given the current staffing crisis we are facing, and given the allocation of resources, and every time I go to a Mariners' game, and I see the SPD officers directing traffic.",71,,
552,0.97,4582.11,4594.156,"I'm like, I would much rather see that overtime shift be a burglary emphasis in a small business district.",71,,
553,0.97,4594.156,4594.389,Right?,71,,
554,0.97,4594.389,4609.004,"Whenever I see officers augmenting the parks employees for an Enencampment removal when we know it can be done without taking up police resources, they could walk the beat in the neighborhood business district instead right now.",71,,
555,0.97,4609.004,4609.237,Right?,71,,
556,0.97,4609.237,4642.971,"I really do think it has to be part of the equation where we are going to pivot to, you know, the agenda item next talking about hiring, which we need to do, and I appreciate the leadership of the chair and Councilmember Nelson in Cueing up the consideration, but it's also part of the equation, we have big opportunity costs, and we are electing to have officers do things other people could do when we need them to do the things only they can do.",71,,
557,0.97,4642.971,4649.645,I continue that to be part of the project and appreciate the conversation as moving us towards that.,71,,
558,0.97,4649.645,4650.012,Thank you.,72,,
559,0.97,4650.012,4653.782,What we want to be clear about is this the opening discussion.,73,,
560,0.97,4653.782,4660.589,We were focused on the data and where we are on the data.,73,,
561,0.97,4660.589,4661.657,"A absolutely, Councilmember, it's a proposition.",73,,
562,0.97,4661.657,4662.824,I agree with what you're saying.,73,,
563,0.97,4662.824,4668.53,It seems like we are on the same page.,73,,
564,0.97,4668.53,4677.906,"We want to be innovative, collaborate, and create alternative responses to take the calls we should not be sending officers to.",73,,
565,0.97,4677.906,4682.31,"We want to be Deliberative, but we want to create what makes sense.",73,,
566,0.97,4682.31,4682.811,This is the first step.,73,,
567,0.97,4682.811,4690.519,"I apologize because we are trying to do the work well, and the administration is doing the work differently.",73,,
568,0.97,4690.519,4693.288,I do apologize we may be moving backwards to move forwards.,73,,
569,0.97,4693.288,4702.264,"I hope we will make it up in the fact we want to collaborate with the Council to do it together, not separately.",73,,
570,0.97,4702.264,4702.631,Thank you.,74,,
571,0.97,4702.631,4711.54,"I just want to restate something I already said, but put it within the public safety context that Councilmember Lewis just said.",74,,
572,0.97,4711.54,4733.161,"One of the lessons from notes I have received from meetings that you have been having with central staff, one of the lessons learned, it's actually consistent with the recommendation of the prior administration for the creation of what was men being called, and one.",74,,
573,0.97,4733.161,4761.089,"Those were the person down and wellness calls, and this executive recognizes that some of the calls can be handled by Csos, so we don't have to stand up with one, but we need to figure out a way to allow Csos to take those calls, and that is a Subset of the 12%.",74,,
574,0.97,4761.089,4765.16,"I think it's about 4,000 calls.",74,,
575,0.97,4765.16,4783.111,"We should get moving on alternate response for that--for those calls that you guys acknowledge are calls that Csos are currently handling, and they could handle if dispatched off 911.",74,,
576,0.97,4783.111,4800.595,"The Cscc acknowledges that although they are really looking forward to the acquisition of the new protocols, the Rfp is out now, and training, and implementing the new protocols, and they could do the dispatch to Csos.",74,,
577,0.97,4800.595,4808.336,"Recognize there's labor issues, but I think we need a staged approach to get going on this stuff now.",74,,
578,0.97,4808.336,4819.648,It will allow our police officers to be spending their time on the things that only they can do.,74,,
579,0.97,4819.648,4826.121,"Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda, maybe first Lauren because I think he is responding to something that was said, and then Councilmember Mosqueda.",74,,
580,0.97,4826.121,4826.988,Thank you.,74,,
581,0.97,4826.988,4827.989,Thank you very much.,75,,
582,0.97,4827.989,4838.833,I just want to confirm we are actually contracted with the Council of state governments to do quality assurance.,75,,
583,0.97,4838.833,4839.868,They are the third party quality assurance partners.,75,,
584,0.97,4844.039,4845.74,Thank you.,76,,
585,0.97,4845.74,4846.241,Councilmember Mosqueda.,76,,
586,0.97,4846.241,4848.476,Thank you for coming back to that question.,77,,
587,0.97,4848.476,4850.412,That was part of my Followup.,77,,
588,0.97,4850.412,4855.917,Can you tell me a little bit more what that means and what their role is?,77,,
589,0.97,4855.917,4862.691,"Are we doing the internal analysis, and the final product is shared with them, and they do Vetting, and then it's the final.",77,,
590,0.97,4862.691,4882.677,"Just so I'm clear, what is the time line for filling out and populating this matrix with the four call types with the data.",77,,
591,0.97,4882.677,4883.245,Additional detail.,78,,
592,0.97,4883.245,4895.29,"Whenever there's a large project that has some sort of major policy implications for the way we respond to things, we feel it's important to have a third quality assurance vendor with us.",78,,
593,0.97,4895.29,4900.729,"The Council of state governments is integrated with the development team, and they attend regular meetings.",78,,
594,0.97,4900.729,4901.796,We are currently in a pause.,78,,
595,0.97,4901.796,4920.348,"We have been in a pause for a week and a half now as we are waiting for itd to catch up with data development, but as soon as that data is pack in our hands--because we don't want to burn their funds, we will pick up with the weekly meetings again.",78,,
596,0.97,4920.348,4926.054,"They follow along with each stage, and I asked them to respond to three discreet questions.",78,,
597,0.97,4926.054,4935.897,One has to do with the confidence we can have in relating the adverse event to the police response.,78,,
598,0.97,4935.897,4948.71,"The additional piece is related to the clustering, and the question of likelihood, it's kind of an open question, and initially we will look for natural clustering in the data.",78,,
599,0.97,4948.71,4953.415,"We do recognize, however, that bears some Weighin from stake holders and community partners, and that may change.",78,,
600,0.97,4953.415,4962.357,"I would ask them to weigh in on the math behind the clustering, and the implications for the adjustments to the parameter.",78,,
601,0.97,4962.357,4983.712,"Specifically the loading of the different cells in the risk matrix, and the final question, after we assess the level of effort necessary, technically necessary to assist Cscc and confidential identify the call response tiers, they will be backing us up on the approach.",78,,
602,0.97,4983.712,4987.916,The approach is going to be confrontational in nature.,78,,
603,0.97,4987.916,4992.487,"It's a complicated piece of math and processing, and they will also back us up on that.",78,,
604,0.97,4992.487,5000.528,"They follow along with the development process, and we run the hybrid, agile development in the research.",78,,
605,0.97,5000.528,5004.366,They are also focused on the three discreet questions that we have.,78,,
606,0.97,5004.366,5020.749,"They will be digging into the math, methods, and implications, and then rendering the final report for informing us of whether the way forward we have selected is advisable or not, and offering suggestions for the future.",78,,
607,0.97,5020.749,5022.517,That's fairly typical for this engagement.,78,,
608,0.97,5022.517,5047.175,"I apologize, in terms of the road map, as soon as the data is prepared, we will populate the matrix, and the projected time line for that is eminent, the next couple of weeks, and the idea is that it will be available for the July report, and there are some technical Dependencies on itd, and that's an open risk for us.",78,,
609,0.97,5047.175,5060.055,"Once that is done, council chair, I want to acknowledge your wish that we proceed in A█ piece or on multiple fronts.",78,,
610,0.97,5060.055,5061.856,We are not waterfall.,78,,
611,0.97,5061.856,5072.567,"We prefer the agile approach, meaning not necessarily a linear step through, but multiple parallel paths to get us there at the same time in an efficient capacity.",78,,
612,0.97,5072.567,5086.815,The director has led that direction in terms of making sure we are building capacity strategically based on the evidence while the technical effort to Operationallize the analysis is ongoing at the same time.,78,,
613,0.97,5086.815,5088.082,Thank you.,79,,
614,0.97,5088.082,5088.516,Uh-uh.,80,,
615,0.97,5088.516,5090.218,Councilmember Pedersen.,81,,
616,0.97,5090.218,5091.886,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",82,,
617,0.97,5091.886,5095.723,"Thank you, chair, for lifting up the important research.",82,,
618,0.97,5095.723,5099.727,Appreciate the Mayor's office being Hee to report on the progress in the middle of it.,82,,
619,0.97,5099.727,5118.546,"I think the theme we are hearing here, we want the alternatives in place as soon as possible, and for an appropriate Subset of the 911 emergency response calls, and so I just want to let you know, I concur with my colleagues saying let's dual track this.",82,,
620,0.97,5118.546,5140.869,"Let's do the pilot as soon as possible, and acknowledging that we do have this matrix of other efforts happening with Treage health one, community service officers, Dsc mobile crisis response unit, and could we get a date on next steps?",82,,
621,0.97,5140.869,5144.973,When will this analysis be finished?,82,,
622,0.97,5144.973,5152.347,And how soon do you think you could roll out a pilot that is integrated?,82,,
623,0.97,5152.347,5160.421,"I was reading Oakland, California, just launched their pilot last month, and you know, in addition to having Kahoots out there and Denver Star for a long time.",82,,
624,0.97,5160.421,5169.931,"Could we get some dates so that we can then know, and the public can know when to follow up on this?",82,,
625,0.97,5169.931,5186.147,"I understand the next stage will be a report, the second quarter report in July, and what I'm hearing is that it will include the data, but I am not quite sure what comes next.",83,,
626,0.97,5186.147,5192.086,"Well, let me jump in there quickly.",84,,
627,0.97,5192.086,5195.089,"The eminent deadline, that's what we are hoping.",84,,
628,0.97,5195.089,5196.457,We will see the data eminently.,84,,
629,0.97,5196.457,5226.955,"After that point, I think what we are planning and Collaboratively planning to do, to have Stakeholders coming to the table from a variety of different entities and places including central staff and the Council to talk through the risk of the calls, and what we are comfortable as a city shifting, and then, you know, we are building out the research and the modeling around what could take on some of the calls, and while at the same time, pivoting what we can pivot.",84,,
630,0.97,5226.955,5235.33,"What I would say is I think July would be a great--I mean, I think it's a great deadline for the status update.",84,,
631,0.97,5235.33,5238.032,I'm hopeful we will get things moving before July.,84,,
632,0.97,5238.032,5244.505,"Councilmember, I don't necessarily have an answer for you right now as far as what the dates are.",84,,
633,0.97,5244.505,5261.656,"We can provide a supplemental response to the group, just to say here's--here are some of the time lines and what we are hoping to do in standing up the work groups and collaborative work together.",84,,
634,0.97,5261.656,5263.291,That would be fantastic.,85,,
635,0.97,5263.291,5263.524,Great.,85,,
636,0.97,5263.524,5264.325,All right.,85,,
637,0.97,5264.325,5270.231,"Well, again, thank you for being here, really appreciate it.",85,,
638,0.97,5270.231,5279.974,Appreciate hearing that this administration is committed to doing this work and committed to doing it Collaboratively so we can move forward together.,85,,

640,0.97,5280.742,5296.524,"There are no further questions or comments, and we will move on to the next item",85,,
641,0.97,5319.947,5339.1,"Before we get started, Councilmember Nelson would you like to speak to your resolution or have central staff describe it?",86,,
642,0.97,5339.1,5339.233,.,86,,
643,0.97,5339.233,5339.734,You are muted.,87,,
644,0.97,5339.734,5340.034,Sorry.,87,,
645,0.97,5340.034,5345.94,I will speak to it and then central staff can pick up the pieces.,88,,
646,0.97,5345.94,5350.545,I am chair of the economic development technology and city light committee.,88,,
647,0.97,5350.545,5359.42,I am supposed to be focused on helping our economy recover as we emerge from this pandemic.,88,,
648,0.97,5359.42,5375.169,Priorities for my committee include downtown and neighborhood district revitalization and reducing displacement of small businesses in areas of our city undergoing rapid Gentrification.,88,,
649,0.97,5375.169,5376.304,Why am I doing this?,88,,
650,0.97,5376.304,5386.414,"On the campaign trail and since taking office, I have heard the same thing over and over again.",88,,
651,0.97,5386.414,5387.215,Residents don't feel safe.,88,,
652,0.97,5387.215,5391.152,911 call response times are through the roof.,88,,
653,0.97,5391.152,5392.854,Businesses are closing because of crime.,88,,
654,0.97,5392.854,5398.393,The plain fact is we can't achieve recovery unless we improve public safety.,88,,
655,0.97,5398.393,5400.094,That should be our only job.,88,,
656,0.97,5400.094,5403.331,That's why I am putting this forward today.,88,,
657,0.97,5403.331,5420.782,"My resolution makes the case for taking urgent action to address the city's escalating rates of violent and property crime amid, the severe staffing shortage.",88,,
658,0.97,5420.782,5426.354,Identifies tool used by virtually every other in our region to accelerate hiring of new officers.,88,,
659,0.97,5426.354,5433.661,Clearly Seattle is not the only city scrambling for labor.,88,,
660,0.97,5433.661,5439.267,"Partly because of low morale, our city has lost more than any other city.",88,,
661,0.97,5439.267,5442.37,About 400 since January 2020.,88,,
662,0.97,5442.37,5445.606,Those are officers in service.,88,,
663,0.97,5445.606,5452.88,Fully trained and experienced officers are leaving SPD for neighboring jurisdictions.,88,,
664,0.97,5452.88,5458.653,So I learned something when I was talking to an officer I met a couple weeks ago.,88,,
665,0.97,5458.653,5468.83,"He said when an officer in SPD applies for Lateral position in neighboring jurisdiction, they have to get the sign off recommendations from fellow officers.",88,,
666,0.97,5468.83,5471.899,He told me he had filled out three in just one week.,88,,
667,0.97,5471.899,5486.581,"I think those officers were going to, if my memory is correct, Sammamish, Everett, and Snohomish.",88,,
668,0.97,5486.581,5488.716,"Puyallup, Sammamish, Everett.",88,,
669,0.97,5488.716,5493.721,Those as well as others using hiring recruits for officers.,88,,
670,0.97,5493.721,5502.363,To level the playing field to limit the applicants Seattle must do the same and implement a similar program.,88,,
671,0.97,5502.363,5511.706,My resolution SETS stage for releasing restricted funds in SPD budget to pay for incentives and other recruitment support strategies.,88,,
672,0.97,5511.706,5512.173,That's it.,88,,
673,0.97,5512.173,5524.886,"When I put this forward in March '23, I frankly didn't care the specifics of the incentive program, how much money should be spent on it, what the details should be.",88,,
674,0.97,5524.886,5536.063,I figured I would leave that to the executive to devise a system that will be competitive and that the Council would later approve.,88,,
675,0.97,5536.063,5550.244,I simply wanted to provide the policy framework to discuss what's going on in our city and give our residents and our constituents a chance to weigh in.,88,,
676,0.97,5550.244,5561.055,This resolution is the necessary first step toward the action we'll hopefully be taking later this meeting.,88,,
677,0.97,5561.055,5572.833,"Do you want to add to anything I have said or I will now answer questions, comments.",88,,
678,0.97,5572.833,5574.302,"Aly, Greg.",88,,
679,0.97,5574.302,5579.006,"Good morning Council members, chair Herbold.",89,,
680,0.97,5579.006,5579.941,I am Aly Pennucci.,89,,
681,0.97,5579.941,5583.244,Greg is available if necessary but is doing double duty.,89,,
682,0.97,5583.244,5593.12,"If there is a question, I will need a minute to get him fully back Online but I think we can probably cover it with myself and you all in this discussion today.",89,,
683,0.97,5593.12,5595.79,I don't have a lot to add.,89,,
684,0.97,5595.79,5600.595,Councilmember Nelson did a good job of describing the intent of the resolution.,89,,
685,0.97,5600.595,5611.605,I think she went into more details that are outlined in the recitals expressing some of the policy goals and background information.,89,,
686,0.97,5611.605,5620.014,The resolution as she described is really expressing Council's intent if adopted to support staffing incentive programs.,89,,
687,0.97,5620.014,5638.799,It would provide clear direction to the executive that the Council is willing to consider modifying or lifting proviso to release some of the funds restricted by Council's budget action this fall in adopting 2022 budget to support the staffing incentive programs.,89,,
688,0.97,5638.799,5646.407,I won't jump fully ahead to the next item but we'll know the resolution and Council bill kind of work hand in hand.,89,,
689,0.97,5646.407,5658.085,Resolution would set high level policy intent and Council bill Councilmember Herbold proposed is a step to implementing a specific program under the authorization.,89,,
690,0.97,5658.085,5658.986,I will leave it there.,89,,
691,0.97,5658.986,5665.292,There is one amendment I am happy to describe at the chair's direction.,89,,
692,0.97,5665.292,5666.494,"Thank you, Aly.",90,,
693,0.97,5666.494,5682.109,"Before we get the resolution before us and begin discussing amendments, are there any questions about the base resolution?",90,,
694,0.97,5682.109,5692.186,"Seeing none, and maybe there will be as we go through the conversation, Councilmember Nelson would you like to move resolution 32050?",90,,
695,0.97,5692.186,5693.02,So moved.,91,,
696,0.97,5693.02,5694.388,Is there a second?,92,,
697,0.97,5694.388,5694.955,Second.,93,,
698,0.97,5694.955,5703.731,It's been moved and Seconded to adopt resolution 32050.,94,,
699,0.97,5703.731,5710.738,"Councilmember Nelson, do you have additional comments about base legislation before we move on to discussion of the amendment?",94,,
700,0.97,5710.738,5710.971,No.,95,,
701,0.97,5710.971,5715.176,I will provide closing comments before the vote.,95,,
702,0.97,5715.176,5716.544,Perfect.,96,,
703,0.97,5716.544,5716.844,Thank you.,96,,
704,0.97,5716.844,5720.748,So I have proposed amendment 1 to the resolution.,96,,
705,0.97,5720.748,5722.683,I move amendment 1. is there a second?,96,,
706,0.97,5722.683,5723.15,Second.,97,,
707,0.97,5723.15,5725.119,Thank you so much.,98,,
708,0.97,5725.119,5734.895,"Moved and Seconded to amend resolution as presented on amendment 1. Aly, can you please describe amendment 1?",98,,
709,0.97,5734.895,5735.129,Yes.,99,,
710,0.97,5735.129,5737.031,Thank you.,99,,
711,0.97,5737.031,5740.534,Is my screen sharing working okay?,99,,
712,0.97,5740.534,5740.868,It is.,100,,
713,0.97,5740.868,5742.903,Great.,101,,
714,0.97,5742.903,5754.381,Amendment 1 proposed by Councilmember Herbold would modify Proposalling signaling Council's intent to modify proviso.,101,,
715,0.97,5754.381,5758.953,Specifically would only release amounts necessary to implement ...,101,,
716,0.97,5758.953,5770.097,Acknowledging that some of the 2022 salary savings is one of the strategies to help mitigate projected gap between general fund expenditures and revenues projected in 2023 and beyond.,101,,
717,0.97,5770.097,5774.935,What I have on the screen here is the affect statement.,101,,
718,0.97,5774.935,5784.044,Then I will Scroll down so you can see what the specific text changes proposed in this amendment would do.,101,,
719,0.97,5784.044,5799.793,"As we prefer to the sort of projected 2023 budget challenges the Council has been discussing at last week's Finance and housing Committee, the make up is the same as this committee so you were all briefed where we stand.",101,,
720,0.97,5799.793,5802.396,I won't say more about that now but happy to answer questions.,101,,
721,0.97,5802.396,5803.797,Thank you so much.,102,,
722,0.97,5803.797,5806.033,Really appreciate it.,102,,
723,0.97,5806.033,5810.704,I don't have much to add here.,102,,
724,0.97,5810.704,5839.6,I just wanted to propose this language to recognize that we do have 2023 budget constraints and that that is a consideration before the council as it relates to adoption of future legislation to support staffing and recruitment incentives.,102,,
725,0.97,5839.6,5845.773,I know they're considerations of the executive as well.,102,,
726,0.97,5845.773,5866.427,"Also in recognition that right now in this point of time, the value of the budget proviso, salary savings is between 4.1 and $4.5 million.",102,,
727,0.97,5866.427,5881.542,It may increase in value if the ability to hire officers consistent with the now revised hiring plan continues to slip.,102,,
728,0.97,5881.542,5896.39,"And so the language as written presumed that we were going to make all the money available in salary savings for this purpose, and this gives us some opportunity to sort of right size that investment.",102,,
729,0.97,5896.39,5904.398,That's all I have on that.,102,,
730,0.97,5904.398,5910.604,Any questions about the amendment?,102,,
731,0.97,5910.604,5910.871,Comment?,102,,
732,0.97,5910.871,5911.405,Councilman Mosqueda.,103,,
733,0.97,5911.405,5912.94,Thank you Madam chair.,104,,
734,0.97,5912.94,5916.81,"Madam chair, I appreciate the amendment that you are bringing forward here.",104,,
735,0.97,5916.81,5920.581,I do intend to vote yes to support your amendment.,104,,
736,0.97,5920.581,5924.451,I will however underscore my concerns with the underlying legislation.,104,,
737,0.97,5924.451,5928.422,I appreciate the amendment because I do have to care about policy details.,104,,
738,0.97,5928.422,5932.259,I do care about the impact on our overall budget.,104,,
739,0.97,5932.259,5941.268,I do care about how spending in one category affects spending in any other category in our city budget.,104,,
740,0.97,5941.268,5974.435,"That's our responsibility as budget members, members of the Finance Committee and all of us heard that the gap that we are currently facing, while it has shrunk from approximately 148 million to about $35 million thanks in large part to central staff's deep dive analysis, thanks for working in collaboration with director of our office, still have a multi million dollar Gaithersburg many for 2023, 2024 budget years and out years.",104,,
741,0.97,5974.435,5984.144,"In large part it was filled with jump start funds that helped make sure we were not in the red in 2020 and 2021, 2022.",104,,
742,0.97,5984.144,5989.717,"However, we are very much needing to make sure that we close that gap.",104,,
743,0.97,5989.717,6016.076,"As you heard the director from city budget's office say in our Finance Committee meeting, we apparently asked our departments to hold back funding for 2022 spending which is spending priorities of the Mayor's office and city council members including things like hygiene centers, bathrooms for folks who need to use it as tourists or folks who live here are housing and Unhoused.",104,,
744,0.97,6016.076,6038.032,We have asked about domestic worker bill of rights outreach and important critical aspects of every budget item we agreed to as Council and executive last year that I know were painful not not only the departments to ask for a hold but now also the community.,104,,
745,0.97,6038.032,6047.374,"Now having to hold back 6% next year, none of us want to be in that position especially since we seek to impact from Covid.",104,,
746,0.97,6047.374,6050.377,It is through this budget lens.,104,,
747,0.97,6050.377,6070.297,All five of us are on the Finance Committee and I want to raise concerns about the approach today and also emphasize that Seattle police Department's budget got $355.5 million in last year's budget.,104,,
748,0.97,6070.297,6099.96,"This made sure there was no cuts to the SPD staffing plan, no cuts to SPD officers in proposed budget and funded expansion, new technology deemed essential, funded 6.4 million additional funding to bring the total to over 26 million, added 4 million for discretionary purposes above the proposed budget sent to us and travel and training in the midst of Covid.",104,,
749,0.97,6099.96,6106.667,All this was done to be sure that the full core functions of SPD budget were funded.,104,,
750,0.97,6106.667,6113.507,One of the potential strategies we had to deal with was trying to make sure we recruited 125 officers.,104,,
751,0.97,6113.507,6117.511,I still think that should be done using existing resources.,104,,
752,0.97,6117.511,6130.624,I do not support making an effort to dip into reserves that are being made possible from this proviso and lifted for a blank check.,104,,
753,0.97,6130.624,6134.294,The amendment helps that and helps Prioritize what actions can be taking place.,104,,
754,0.97,6134.294,6148.141,This is not time for us to be looking at giving over money to SPD to use in this critical juncture where we are asking other departments to put hold on current spending and potentially think about reductions next year.,104,,
755,0.97,6148.141,6163.323,We will do everything to be sure that's not the case but I think we need every dollar available to make sure we are investing in core government services and that is making sure people will have access to critical services in addition to public safety.,104,,
756,0.97,6163.323,6170.063,Given full hiring plan was already funded I do not support lifting proviso.,104,,
757,0.97,6170.063,6177.07,I do however support your amendment to try to scope this resolution.,104,,
758,0.97,6177.07,6178.272,Thank you Councilman Mosqueda.,105,,
759,0.97,6178.272,6184.678,"Before I hand it to Councilmember Nelson, you will appreciate this.",105,,
760,0.97,6184.678,6190.217,This is not new money for SPD.,105,,
761,0.97,6190.217,6195.189,This is from salary savings associated with the 125 officer spending plan.,105,,
762,0.97,6195.189,6199.159,"This is dollars they cannot, already allocated to SPD that they cannot spend.",105,,
763,0.97,6199.159,6204.464,I heard you say something that made it sound like we are giving new money to SPD.,105,,
764,0.97,6204.464,6207.067,That is not the case.,105,,
765,0.97,6207.067,6218.512,This is currently in their budget and they can't spend because of the proviso placed on it.,105,,
766,0.97,6218.512,6220.781,I currently agree with you.,105,,
767,0.97,6220.781,6225.219,I think executive AGREES as well.,105,,
768,0.97,6225.219,6251.178,I understand from my Coversations with the budget director that they intend to look to salary savings as one way to help with some city wide budget impacts associated with reduced revenue.,105,,
769,0.97,6251.178,6276.136,What this amendment does is tries to recognize that these funds and there are significant more than we anticipated when we first enacted proviso on the Salvatore Reallocate savings may be a useful strategy to address a number of issues.,105,,
770,0.97,6276.136,6291.184,"Given that we all voted for the staffing and funding necessary for the staffing and hiring of 125 officers, money that is in the category for hiring officers, it seems appropriate.",105,,
771,0.97,6291.184,6307.167,"If you are still supportive of that goal, it seems appropriate to spend some dollars to help us, well not meet the goal now because we have already slipped but to at least meet the 98 officer goal.",105,,
772,0.97,6307.167,6309.236,A quick follow up.,106,,
773,0.97,6309.236,6315.342,I appreciate you clarifying for members of the public and also for Council members that this is not new money.,106,,
774,0.97,6315.342,6323.784,We always struggle with that dynamic when it comes to lifting Provisos.,106,,
775,0.97,6323.784,6330.39,The point about handing over funds that currently have proviso in SPD would be allowing them to use it.,106,,
776,0.97,6330.39,6339.366,I do appreciate your amendment helps keep what that amount would be within existing funds that currently have proviso on it.,106,,
777,0.97,6339.366,6361.722,"Again I think the concern while it is a larger amount that's currently being held in the proviso than we originally thought it might be, the gap that we have at the end of the year for not just 2022 but out years as well is significantly.",106,,
778,0.97,6361.722,6372.365,Thanks to the work with the six year financial plan but the has given me great pause.,107,,
779,0.97,6372.365,6380.107,Thanks for helping me with the lifting of the proviso effect.,107,,
780,0.97,6380.107,6385.412,Thanks so much.,108,,
781,0.97,6385.412,6385.879,Councilmember Nelson.,108,,
782,0.97,6385.879,6387.18,Thank you.,109,,
783,0.97,6387.18,6402.395,I wanted to clarify my resolution doesn't say spend all the money that will be salary savings in SPD budget as a result of the fact that more officers are leaving and it is difficult to hire new officers.,109,,
784,0.97,6402.395,6403.864,In fact only 13.,109,,
785,0.97,6403.864,6407.2,I don't specify that everything should be spent.,109,,
786,0.97,6407.2,6418.478,I identify those salary savings as a source of funding.,109,,
787,0.97,6418.478,6422.816,I appreciate you Nuancing Councilmember Mosqueda's portrayal of what this does.,109,,
788,0.97,6422.816,6429.389,This does not take money away from other priorities.,109,,
789,0.97,6429.389,6430.791,This already exists.,109,,
790,0.97,6430.791,6437.597,", money Council knowing probably projected budget shortfalls in the future here funded at 125 officers.",109,,
791,0.97,6437.597,6457.784,"So they made that, you made that decision last year and this is simply keeping that money for use within the Department to get to the goal originally stated which is to hire officers.",109,,
792,0.97,6457.784,6461.054,We can disagree over what would be a better use.,109,,
793,0.97,6461.054,6463.557,But I will state for the record that people are dying.,109,,
794,0.97,6463.557,6467.127,We don't have enough officers to respond quickly to emergencies.,109,,
795,0.97,6467.127,6475.969,We say we want to get guns off the street but we don't have investigators to really do that work because they're deployed to patrol.,109,,
796,0.97,6475.969,6488.248,"To me, and this is just my personal thought, nothing is more important than ensuring safety of our residents.",109,,
797,0.97,6488.248,6492.385,"So anyway, that's what I am trying to get it.",109,,
798,0.97,6492.385,6499.192,I realize Council members and executive might be looking to use some of the salary savings for other purposes.,109,,
799,0.97,6499.192,6522.415,But I think we have to go through the conversation and define in the next piece of legislation we'll be talking about how much we are talking about and what will it cover.,109,,
800,0.97,6522.415,6528.121,I can recognize Councilmember Pedersen.,110,,
801,0.97,6528.121,6531.157,Thank you.,111,,
802,0.97,6531.157,6535.462,"Briefly, I will be supporting Councilmember Nell's resolution.",111,,

804,0.97,6536.196,6542.168,I support it with the amendments.,111,,

809,0.97,6559.185,6559.419,Great.,112,,
810,0.97,6559.419,6560.32,Closing remarks.,113,,

828,0.97,6606.766,6608.068,Councilmember Mosqueda.,126,,
829,0.97,6608.068,6611.037,Thank you very much Madam chair.,127,,
830,0.97,6611.037,6616.743,I appreciate the work you tried to do to find.,127,,
831,0.97,6616.743,6620.347,I will not be able to support this.,127,,
832,0.97,6620.347,6622.148,I already outlined the issues we are facing.,127,,
833,0.97,6622.148,6634.227,I think again this is a critical moment to look at every dollar and we have made tough decisions as collective city family already in 2022 on important 2022 priorities.,127,,
834,0.97,6634.227,6644.07,We have asked folks to put pause on a new of investments I know all of us deeply troubled by.,127,,
835,0.97,6644.07,6653.98,We want on the other hand be throwing up additional dollar to help address issue.,127,,
836,0.97,6653.98,6667.193,This is also about making sure we have investments that things within the human resource in our city has identified ways to cite retention and recruitment.,127,,
837,0.97,6667.193,6672.132,I will cite the final report which Seattle police Department was part of.,127,,
838,0.97,6672.132,6680.673,It did not identify pay as a barrier to either hiring or retaining SPD officers.,127,,
839,0.97,6680.673,6686.413,"That includes incentive bonuses, did not identify hiring bonus as a recommendation.",127,,
840,0.97,6686.413,6706.366,"The four made by the Workgroup included focus on Leveraging Techno logical Seclusions, revise to engage candidates, advance toll talent quickly through the process and extend offers in a more competitive time frame.",127,,
841,0.97,6706.366,6719.045,"In response to the slide, it said SPD said the Department communicated it did not see increase in hiring since applying incentive in 2021.",127,,
842,0.97,6719.045,6736.963,"As mentioned from the central staff, they contacted police director and executive director of International Association of police Chiefs to determine if there are specific evaluations or researches on the effectiveness of hiring in policing.",127,,
843,0.97,6736.963,6746.94,It notice the that the information they received from Heymann center advice Department reported notice often it is meant to reduce prospects.,127,,
844,0.97,6746.94,6755.882,"Once an employee is on board, even a structured sign on bonus with pay out time tied to time and service has limited impact.",127,,
845,0.97,6755.882,6783.109,Money is a one time fix that may not compensate . It noted signing bonuses for newly hired talent can negatively impact morale.,127,,
846,0.97,6783.109,6790.483,Employees reported internally can be not a match when they notice what this colleagues are.,127,,
847,0.97,6790.483,6806.8,I would think the city unions have not thicken . hiring incentives are extended Prehire and would not have direct labor implications.,127,,
848,0.97,6806.8,6810.804,I again am not going to be supportive of this effort in front of us today.,127,,
849,0.97,6810.804,6816.142,We are asking more and more of front line officers.,127,,
850,0.97,6816.142,6816.576,That is very true.,127,,
851,0.97,6816.576,6828.054,"To the conversation that took place in agenda item one, we are doing everything we can to include the type of calls officers go out on.",127,,
852,0.97,6828.054,6846.005,I know that will have impact on retention strategies and it will help with recruitment because folks when a difference response and not have to be housing.,127,,
853,0.97,6846.005,6852.946,Covid had significant impact on us within the city family and Nonproperty community.,127,,
854,0.97,6852.946,6860.653,There is a huge demand to be sure more providers are coming to provide additional support so we can go up stream.,127,,
855,0.97,6860.653,6872.498,That is part of the interest in looking at comprehensive suite of investment strategies in the fall we we extended the budget.,127,,
856,0.97,6872.498,6898.324,To the folks who are concerned about public safety I will reiterate we have a herring plan in place over 355 million that go to SPD and interested in making sure we get alternative strategies out the door so we can continue to decrease call demand and improve retention and morale that way.,127,,
857,0.97,6898.324,6909.202,"I am happy to work with my close, Madam chair, especially as as you have been leading this on the front line for many years.",127,,
858,0.97,6909.202,6919.979,I know many folks within SPD are interested in how be create a work plan that meets their traditionalist verses House managers and case managers.,127,,
859,0.97,6919.979,6920.913,Thank you.,128,,
860,0.97,6920.913,6930.423,I want to clarify something you said reminded me of something and I wanted to respond because I was listening to public conflict.,129,,
861,0.97,6930.423,6948.241,This resolution does not presume what will be in the recommendation that we receive from the executive on hiring incentives and recruitment program.,129,,
862,0.97,6948.241,6957.717,I have heard they too are skeptical about a traditional bonus program where we cut a collect to new recruits.,129,,
863,0.97,6957.717,6975.168,I would not want to characterize this as Presupposing what recommendation we get from the executive.,129,,
864,0.97,6975.168,6978.705,Handing it back to Councilmember Nelson.,129,,
865,0.97,6978.705,6979.172,Thank you.,130,,
866,0.97,6979.172,6982.742,"These are not my closing, closing.",130,,
867,0.97,6982.742,6992.618,"In nuance of what was said, you are right, you fully funded Councilmember Mosqueda, SPD's hiring plan.",130,,
868,0.97,6992.618,7001.327,So why not use that money to accelerate hiring of officers?,130,,
869,0.97,7001.327,7002.862,You touched on retention.,130,,
870,0.97,7002.862,7004.197,You are absolutely right.,130,,
871,0.97,7004.197,7017.043,A better way to keep our Department whole is to keep officers from leaving.,130,,
872,0.97,7017.043,7022.348,Retention bonuses would be grateful and signal that we appreciate the work officers are already doing.,130,,
873,0.97,7022.348,7029.922,This does not get at that because retention bonuses have to occur in bargaining.,130,,
874,0.97,7029.922,7033.793,So we can't touch that.,130,,
875,0.97,7033.793,7038.598,You are concerned about what is this going to do to future budgets?,130,,
876,0.97,7038.598,7046.239,I was listening to the presentation last week.,130,,
877,0.97,7046.239,7055.615,2010 to 2022 general fund revenues grew by 86% and general fund spending grew by 97%.,130,,
878,0.97,7055.615,7062.789,We are Approacing level of revenues that are Greeter than Prepandemic levels.,130,,
879,0.97,7062.789,7074.5,There are decisions made by this city council that have led to the difficult conversations that we will be taking and making next year regarding the budget.,130,,
880,0.97,7074.5,7086.312,But you already had one of those difficult conversations last year when you approved funding for 125 officers this year.,130,,
881,0.97,7086.312,7093.82,So again this resolution does not contemplate taking money away from other priorities.,130,,
882,0.97,7093.82,7102.528,In fact it is simply leaving the money there for its intended use.,130,,
883,0.97,7102.528,7113.806,So I don't want to Belabor this point more and just move on.,130,,
884,0.97,7113.806,7115.475,I listened to public comments too.,130,,
885,0.97,7115.475,7131.057,"Like many of them, I want to get back to focusing on improving policing in Seattle and strengthening our community policing model to build better trust between the community and our Department.",130,,
886,0.97,7131.057,7137.296,We also have the consent decree to get out from underneath.,130,,
887,0.97,7137.296,7138.831,With improved accountability measures.,130,,
888,0.97,7138.831,7161.087,We can't do any of this in a situation of crisis in the police Department when there aren't enough people to investigate serious crimes that are leading to the crimes that our patrol officers are responding to.,130,,
889,0.97,7161.087,7168.761,Times have changed since last year when that's conversations were at the fore.,130,,
890,0.97,7168.761,7178.971,Our constituents living in communities that are more directly impacted by crime have spoken out in clear support of this resolution.,130,,
891,0.97,7178.971,7192.718,"There was an op Ed in Seattle times from Dr. Harriett Alden, Beach, Terel saying please hire more officers.",130,,
892,0.97,7192.718,7193.619,Our community needs it.,130,,
893,0.97,7193.619,7199.158,Same thing in North West Asian weekly last week.,130,,
894,0.97,7199.158,7214.24,"It was written by David Dell, Dr. Ming chow, Anna, all community members concerned about what's happening in the Chinatown International district.",130,,
895,0.97,7214.24,7240.633,Most recently there was an op Ed in Puget sound business Journal making a point maybe not many people realize which is our community gatherings are at stake if we don't have enough officers to do the traffic control and safety for festivals that people are dying to go for this summer as we emerge.,130,,
896,0.97,7240.633,7256.349,So I simply want to say that I know this is a difficult conversation which is precisely why it's been in the public realm for discussion for a couple months.,130,,
897,0.97,7256.349,7272.431,Voters are on a side of a common sense approach to fulfilling primary duty as elected which is to protect health and safety of citizens of Seattle.,130,,
898,0.97,7272.431,7281.107,That's what this resolution is trying to accomplish by paving the way for the specifics of modifying the proviso that's next.,130,,
899,0.97,7281.107,7281.574,Thank you very much.,130,,
900,0.97,7281.574,7294.987,I recognize that there are differences of opinion in this meeting but I ask my colleagues for support of this resolution.,130,,
901,0.97,7294.987,7295.287,Thank you.,130,,
902,0.97,7295.287,7304.93,Will clerk please call role on passage of the resolution?,131,,

925,0.97,7387.48,7399.625,"It would release 650,000 of the salary savings identified to date which chair Herbold described as between 4.1 to 4.5 million.",145,,
926,0.97,7399.625,7413.806,Spd would have authority to pay for moving expenses for Lateral hires that are hired at a certain pay band and to hire another recruiter assuming they have an open pocket.,145,,
927,0.97,7413.806,7437.229,The bill requests that SI Department of human resources works to amend the policies around moving expenses to provide greater flexibility to pay for this for new hires and extend benefits to a broader range of positions when authority determines they're unable to recruit persons in the immediate area.,145,,
928,0.97,7437.229,7448.808,That language also asks human resources Department to Prioritize modifying that rule so that SPD could offer moving expenses to pay for moving expenses for new recruits.,145,,
929,0.97,7448.808,7459.185,Again also to expand that more broadly looking at the needs of all the departments across the city currently.,145,,
930,0.97,7459.185,7472.865,Criteria for moving expenses is focused on executive level positions and as a weekend picks fit to entice people to accept employment.,145,,
931,0.97,7472.865,7474.834,Benefit to entice people to accept employment.,145,,
932,0.97,7474.834,7486.078,Positions perhaps that come in at lower salaries but moving expenses would attract a broader range of candidates and help the candidates be able to relocate to the city.,145,,
933,0.97,7486.078,7488.514,I will leave it there for now.,145,,
934,0.97,7488.514,7492.151,"Thank you so much, Aly.",146,,
935,0.97,7492.151,7497.556,There are a couple additional comments before I open it for discussion.,146,,
936,0.97,7497.556,7528.721,"As I think we know during the work on the 2020 budget, council requested report from the executive on city wide hiring incentive program and requesting that they can see issues be analyzed among front line workers, among departments that have service issues, not met because they can seize or analyzing how they concede are inhibiting Department for fulfilling a core function.",146,,
937,0.97,7528.721,7548.407,"The report indicates there are a number of positions departments struggle to fill and others important for city business including truck drivers, civil engineers, police officers, 911 dispatcher.",146,,
938,0.97,7548.407,7569.295,"As noted by Council central staff, bill requests Department of human resources to amend personnel rules to provide appointing authorities greater flexibility to pay for moving expenses for new hires including police hires because the current personnel rules limit this flexibility.",146,,
939,0.97,7569.295,7578.17,For some reason to only hire pay bands such as Department directors.,146,,
940,0.97,7578.17,7581.206,I think that is a vestige of an old way of thinking.,146,,
941,0.97,7581.206,7597.489,We recognize that we want our departments to be able to recruit great public servants to work for the city in helping pay for relocation costs.,146,,
942,0.97,7597.489,7598.824,Do that across salary levels.,146,,
943,0.97,7598.824,7607.666,That is not a benefit that should be only available to Department directors.,146,,
944,0.97,7607.666,7615.808,Consequently they will request that the Department and even resources amend personal rule to provide the greater flexibility.,146,,
945,0.97,7615.808,7622.781,The second part is to release the proviso on spending.,146,,
946,0.97,7622.781,7626.852,I shouldn't say super proviso.,146,,
947,0.97,7626.852,7631.156,Modify proviso on spending for the police Department.,146,,
948,0.97,7631.156,7638.43,The modification to allow for this funding is actually not needed for other departments.,146,,
949,0.97,7638.43,7661.687,They can currently use funds from position vacancies once Sdhr changes the rules allowing authorities to pay Reroute expenses for other departments is not with the current proviso.,146,,
950,0.97,7661.687,7670.295,Once rules change they can use salary changes created because of recruitment issues in order to pay for relocation costs.,146,,
951,0.97,7670.295,7676.168,Only SPD can't do that because of the proviso.,146,,
952,0.97,7676.168,7695.154,"That's why base legislation would release $650,000 for SPD as noted, complimentary to the resolution, committee considered, what executive is proceeding with.",146,,
953,0.97,7695.154,7697.523,These are not new funds.,146,,
954,0.97,7697.523,7712.805,These are already in the budget associated with the hiring plan to hire 125 officers Council funded in the 2022 budget and now modified main Bead hires.,146,,
955,0.97,7712.805,7724.183,"Releasing funds would work, assist with the now reduced hiring plan which I think makes sense given earlier Council action for the plan.",146,,
956,0.97,7724.183,7742.067,If you voted for sufficient funding to hire 125 officers in November last year hopefully there will would be equal support for some of that existing funding to meet a lesser version of the single.,146,,
957,0.97,7742.067,7743.168,That's the thinking here.,146,,
958,0.97,7743.168,7754.113,Any Councilmember Tech questions or comments on the Council bill before discussing the proposed amendment.,146,,
959,0.97,7754.113,7764.189,I do think I have a question for central staff if possible.,147,,
960,0.97,7764.189,7767.626,You are looking at SPD and other departments.,147,,
961,0.97,7767.626,7767.86,Great.,147,,
962,0.97,7767.86,7782.241,The bill in front of us assumes that moving expenses for SPD related recruits would be taken from salary savings which as we flow is slightly larger than originally anticipated when we passed the budget.,147,,
963,0.97,7782.241,7788.847,My argument is we have huge needs at the end of the year that we'll need to account for for upcoming bi annual budget.,147,,
964,0.97,7788.847,7796.421,I want to ask about the other departments.,147,,
965,0.97,7796.421,7812.104,"I understand from the discussion we had in the Finance and health committee last week that the city budget office is trying do a more thorough job of Realtime budgeting, having accountability reports from the Department so we know in Realtime if there is under spend.",147,,
966,0.97,7812.104,7817.743,However we know what the under spend is at SPD.,147,,
967,0.97,7817.743,7829.688,Do we know what universe of under spend dollars is for other departments and how much this may cost in total?,147,,
968,0.97,7829.688,7831.123,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,148,,
969,0.97,7831.123,7832.191,We don't have that available.,148,,
970,0.97,7832.191,7839.164,It is something we have been in ongoing discussions with CBO and they are working on that.,148,,
971,0.97,7839.164,7841.266,There are a couple Dynamics here.,148,,
972,0.97,7841.266,7852.711,"As a general strategy, we are looking at under spend to help mitigate projected shortfall in '23 and perhaps beyond.",148,,
973,0.97,7852.711,7863.288,"How that works in practice is somewhat complicated for other departments where we are not able to track in such fine detail, sort of the Realtime salary savings.",148,,
974,0.97,7863.288,7866.425,There are a couple things.,148,,
975,0.97,7866.425,7875.167,There are specific spending proposals included in adopted budget currently on hold pending better news forecast for 2023.,148,,
976,0.97,7875.167,7889.915,Those are not necessarily salary savings but specific spending adopted in the 2022 budget that are currently on hold and I think you or chair Herbold mentioned them in a discussion on the resolution.,148,,
977,0.97,7889.915,7898.023,In addition the budget office is looking for under spend across departments that might help mitigate that.,148,,
978,0.97,7898.023,7902.728,They're not currently restricted by proviso.,148,,
979,0.97,7902.728,7916.275,"Executives, departments along seed CBO and Mayor's office can decide to use some to offer moving expenses if they determine it is a critical position without requiring authorization from the Council.",148,,
980,0.97,7916.275,7922.381,My understanding is moving expenses are Audi on a pretty limited basis under current practice but that's anecdotal.,148,,
981,0.97,7922.381,7926.551,I don't have data to support that.,148,,
982,0.97,7926.551,7939.197,"So I don't think it is a tool most appointing authorities are using in a significant way, if they have significant salary savings in any Department that it would feed into that.",148,,
983,0.97,7939.197,7943.669,I think other departments are being asked to hold back certain spending.,148,,
984,0.97,7943.669,7948.707,They're being asked to look at vacancies and salary savings to mitigate those problems.,148,,
985,0.97,7948.707,7958.884,I am not sure if same expectation has been made of the Seattle police Department.,148,,
986,0.97,7958.884,7960.686,Thank you very much.,149,,
987,0.97,7960.686,7961.32,Thank you Aly.,150,,
988,0.97,7961.32,7968.427,I think I would like to get the bill before us.,151,,
989,0.97,7968.427,7977.436,We can continue discussion or move forward to amendment.,151,,
990,0.97,7977.436,7979.571,Some forward momentum here.,151,,
991,0.97,7979.571,7988.68,I would like to move committee recommend passage of 120320.,151,,
992,0.97,7988.68,7990.415,Is there a second?,151,,
993,0.97,7990.415,7991.45,Second.,152,,
994,0.97,7991.45,7992.451,Moved and Seconded.,153,,
995,0.97,7992.451,7996.455,Recommend passage of the bill.,153,,
996,0.97,7996.455,7998.657,"Councilmember Nelson, you have refused amendment one.",153,,
997,0.97,7998.657,8007.299,Would you like to move amendment one?,153,,
998,0.97,8007.299,8010.402,So moved.,154,,
999,0.97,8010.402,8011.203,I will second.,155,,
1000,0.97,8011.203,8018.21,I will hand it to you Councilmember Nelson to speak or have special staff describe it.,155,,
1001,0.97,8018.21,8018.577,Your choice.,155,,
1002,0.97,8018.577,8026.551,I will speak and then have central staff get into specifics.,156,,
1003,0.97,8026.551,8046.004,"Before I speak about the bill at hand, I want to respond to something Councilmember Mosqueda said that will have slightly lower salary savings in SPD's budget.",156,,
1004,0.97,8046.004,8072.764,"Going back to legislative history, council budget action Spd30308-A-001 would cut 2.7 million from SPD's budget that was in the Mayor's budget on the assumption that SPD would only be able to hire 125 officers and incur 125 separations in 2022.",156,,
1005,0.97,8072.764,8090.382,"At the beginning of this year, it was noted that probably weren't going to reach 125 officers and the projected salary savings was more like 1.4 million.",156,,
1006,0.97,8090.382,8094.453,That was back in February.,156,,
1007,0.97,8094.453,8106.097,Now we've got projected 4.1 to $4.5 million in salary savings in SPD.,156,,
1008,0.97,8106.097,8116.508,"That is significant increase because SPD not able because they don't have the tools, I believe, they need to hire the officers Council funded.",156,,
1009,0.97,8116.508,8119.211,I think there has been a misunderstanding.,157,,
1010,0.97,8119.211,8123.782,I did not say there was a decrease in the amount in the proviso.,157,,
1011,0.97,8123.782,8130.989,I was agreeing with chair that there was increase in the amount.,157,,
1012,0.97,8130.989,8132.691,That's what I heard as well.,158,,
1013,0.97,8132.691,8140.131,I am sorry for not catching that.,158,,
1014,0.97,8140.131,8143.168,Your description Councilmember Mosqueda is what I heard as well.,158,,
1015,0.97,8143.168,8151.243,"I heard the word ""slight"" and I thought 1.4 to 4.5 was more than slight.",159,,
1016,0.97,8151.243,8162.888,"Anyway, just moving on when I saw Councilmember Herbold's bill I frankly didn't like it much.",159,,
1017,0.97,8162.888,8182.34,"I thought that $650,000 for relocation expenses and to hire an SPD recruiter was not much money and also relocation expenses precluded spending incentives on people who already live in Seattle.",159,,
1018,0.97,8182.34,8195.153,"After speaking with the director it is clear there are a lot of people in Seattle, particularly the immigrant community, that would like a job in SPD.",159,,
1019,0.97,8195.153,8208.667,After a lot of discussion and realization that compromise is heart of politics I came together with Councilmember Herbold and the Mayor and agreed to this friendly amendment.,159,,
1020,0.97,8208.667,8217.275,I invite Aly now to go through the specifics.,159,,
1021,0.97,8217.275,8219.01,Thank you.,160,,
1022,0.97,8219.01,8243.802,"Amendment one to 120320 sponsored by Councilmember Nelson would increase savings purposes in the bill from 650,000 to 1.5 million and expand use to include paying for national search to fill chief of police position and national ad campaign to attract candidates for police officers.",160,,
1023,0.97,8243.802,8255.28,"As Councilmember Nelson described, the current estimate is 4.1 to 4.5 million of salary savings currently in SPD's 2022 budget.",160,,
1024,0.97,8255.28,8266.358,This would increase total amount they would be authorized to spend from about 15% of total fund available to date to about a quarter.,160,,
1025,0.97,8266.358,8279.337,It would leave about three fourths of the funds available still restricted by proviso and would require further authorization by Council to release additional funds.,160,,
1026,0.97,8279.337,8287.078,Thank you Aly and thank you Councilmember Nelson.,161,,
1027,0.97,8287.078,8297.656,"Note that as we have heard from the Mayor, this is not--this is just first step.",162,,
1028,0.97,8297.656,8305.13,There will be other strategies and potential items that will be put on the table at a later date.,162,,
1029,0.97,8305.13,8309.701,This is really important now because this is money that can be spent now.,162,,
1030,0.97,8309.701,8316.875,Who knows how much we'll be able to spend of the salary savings that's currently on the table.,162,,
1031,0.97,8316.875,8328.553,So I think that this is a good start to meeting immediate needs to put the tools in place that we can start actually recruiting officers that we need.,162,,
1032,0.97,8328.553,8342.067,"Same thing I was thinking in producing also bill flowing that the executive would be bringing a proposal, what can we do now?",163,,
1033,0.97,8342.067,8342.367,Thank you.,163,,
1034,0.97,8342.367,8343.068,Any other comments or comments.,163,,
1035,0.97,8343.068,8345.47,Aly is that an old hand or new one?,163,,
1036,0.97,8345.47,8346.037,A new one.,164,,
1037,0.97,8346.037,8359.351,"I meant to offer a little bit more detail on how we landed on original $650,000 number if it's helpful to the committee.",164,,
1038,0.97,8359.351,8362.22,I will go ahead.,164,,
1039,0.97,8362.22,8376.735,I will say it is not--not knowing how many potential candidates might seek reimbursement for moving expenses there was some rough estimates of what the funding could accomplish.,164,,
1040,0.97,8376.735,8379.738,"We assumed about $100,000 for new recruiter position.",164,,
1041,0.97,8379.738,8382.006,That is likely an over estimate.,164,,
1042,0.97,8382.006,8389.848,It will depend at what point that person will be hired and how much is needed for salary and benefits.,164,,
1043,0.97,8389.848,8393.785,"Asuraling 100,000 for that purpose and that leaves 550,000.",164,,
1044,0.97,8393.785,8411.169,"That would allow police Department to offer maximum moving expenses currently allowed which is $25,000 to 22 or up to 36 if average moving expense was 15,000.",164,,
1045,0.97,8411.169,8423.181,Because of current personnel rules they really could offer these to Lateral hires at this time.,164,,
1046,0.97,8423.181,8430.121,There are . This was enough to move to the broad range of Lateral hires.,164,,
1047,0.97,8430.121,8442.433,"Again if it is successful, council could reconsider releasing additional funds.",164,,
1048,0.97,8442.433,8443.968,Super helpful.,165,,
1049,0.97,8443.968,8444.435,Councilman Mosqueda.,165,,
1050,0.97,8444.435,8444.769,Thank you.,166,,
1051,0.97,8444.769,8456.648,"Madam chair, I think I will make my comments here regarding amendment and underlying bill if that sounds okay Madam chair.",166,,
1052,0.97,8456.648,8460.952,I know you are trying to get us out on time.,166,,
1053,0.97,8460.952,8480.972,I want to note stepping back a second that much of this is brought forward under the concept that somehow Seattle is unique and Councilmember Lewis commented on how not unique and you noticed the similar situations across the country.,166,,
1054,0.97,8480.972,8496.02,"Since noted earlier that Seattle is an Outlier I want to point us to police executive research forum, a workforce that's being expressed, you have people that want to be officers.",166,,
1055,0.97,8496.02,8502.427,You have an increase in people retiring.,166,,
1056,0.97,8502.427,8509.701,We found 44% increase in retirements and 18% percent in resignations across departments.,166,,
1057,0.97,8509.701,8513.137,In Atlanta there were 400 to 500 over the last year.,166,,
1058,0.97,8513.137,8517.809,In Phoenix it is 13% of the allotment.,166,,
1059,0.97,8517.809,8525.55,"Philly, down 440 or 7% of total police officers' budget for the city.",166,,
1060,0.97,8525.55,8530.455,"Winston Salem South Carolina, Department down 96 officers and that's 18% of the allotted force.",166,,
1061,0.97,8530.455,8544.469,"In terms of the data that backs this up from reliant hiring solutions, a firm that works to set up job fairs, it said it was difficult to find recruits across cities according to CNN.",166,,
1062,0.97,8544.469,8549.073,This is not an isolated situation in Seattle.,166,,
1063,0.97,8549.073,8555.38,I appreciate that the good Claire has been trying to find solutions.,166,,
1064,0.97,8555.38,8561.653,I would Proposeto colleagues that there are multiple ways we can address decrease in officers.,166,,
1065,0.97,8561.653,8582.807,"We are not unique in experiencing officers retiring or leaving the force, we can respond uniquely and be on the front edge in terms of how we respond in alternative services.",166,,
1066,0.97,8582.807,8588.513,"Shelter, mental health, food security, all these things generate better health and safety for our community.",166,,
1067,0.97,8588.513,8609.334,I am suggesting that as part of our way to address public safety issues we hold the conversations for later in the year to really make sure we are having a conversation about where we would like any under spend to go in future budgets when we look at the universe of dollars available and universe of needs at the end of the year.,166,,
1068,0.97,8609.334,8618.343,"According to central staff memo in front of us on the legislation, this may impact future budget conditions before Council.",166,,
1069,0.97,8618.343,8622.613,If salary stages are considered one time resource.,166,,
1070,0.97,8622.613,8628.453,Hiring SPD recruiter unless intended to be term limited is ongoing expense.,166,,
1071,0.97,8628.453,8643.468,"This would assume that in 2023 either, a, number of funded police officer positions would be reduced to offset cost of additional general fund would be needed to maintain the number of funded police officer positions.",166,,
1072,0.97,8643.468,8651.342,In the latter the impact would worsen existing structure deficit of the city's general fund.,166,,
1073,0.97,8651.342,8675.166,Given national down turn I am sure and not interested in funding a recruiter position for a labor market that is declining and I don't think this is the best use of funds when the city is currently facing ongoing structural budget issue where general fund expenditures are out pacing revenues in the gap and how fast they're keeping up with costs and services.,166,,
1074,0.97,8675.166,8686.611,As folks heard in our meeting this predates me and Council members who are currently Deliberating the upcoming budget.,166,,
1075,0.97,8686.611,8690.648,This has been a structural issue for years.,166,,
1076,0.97,8690.648,8694.819,Thank goodness we have jump start which helped us back in the black in the last two years.,166,,
1077,0.97,8694.819,8713.471,"What I believe we are saying with the bill in front of us and this resolution, this amendment, is we are already making a determination for how to use potential interest and decisions that will impact budget cycles.",166,,
1078,0.97,8713.471,8731.155,"The question is do we have an opportunity to work with city family including pro Tech and those interested in training and development, wage increases benefits career advancements fairness and equity in the workplace.",166,,
1079,0.97,8731.155,8750.842,All those items is what they identify to us in terms of what strategies they would like to some proposed.,166,,
1080,0.97,8750.842,8777.268,"Recruitment and retention report noted that importance of a multi Prong strategy to be sure we are looking at recruitment and retention and I would like to keep that in mind, leverage technological solutions, revise business practices, engage candidates to retain top talent and extend to a more competitive time frame.",166,,
1081,0.97,8777.268,8782.773,Probably one of the strategies does include a moving incentive.,166,,
1082,0.97,8782.773,8786.744,I think it is important component of a larger picture.,166,,
1083,0.97,8786.744,8807.632,I still cannot support this bill and especially if this emit hangs given impact on the upcoming budget and do commit to working with good Claire to identify ways to flush out or fill out the rest of the strategies across departments.,166,,
1084,0.97,8807.632,8807.999,Thank you.,166,,
1085,0.97,8807.999,8809.0,Thank you.,167,,
1086,0.97,8809.0,8809.5,Councilmember Nelson.,167,,
1087,0.97,8809.5,8826.617,So the figures that were provided for other cities and their loss do not approach the 28% loss in officers in service happening in Seattle.,168,,
1088,0.97,8826.617,8829.42,"I didn't hear 21, 22, or 28.",168,,
1089,0.97,8829.42,8834.025,We I believe are unique in our situation here.,168,,
1090,0.97,8834.025,8850.842,I am not Privy to the conversations Councilmember Mosqueda is having with what I am listening to is our constituents saying they want better public safety.,168,,
1091,0.97,8850.842,8858.316,"That is what I was elected to do, represent their needs.",168,,
1092,0.97,8858.316,8889.68,"I don't think even if we were to authorize full $4.5 million and it were spent in 2022 which is not really a possibility, that's a drop in the bucket of a $117 million projected budget gap in 2023.",168,,
1093,0.97,8889.68,8890.214,There are other places.,168,,
1094,0.97,8890.214,8902.526,Public safety is not the place to make the cuts.,168,,
1095,0.97,8902.526,8903.561,Thank you.,169,,

1119,0.97,8964.822,8975.333,I just want to thank you as chair and also Councilmember Nelson for putting forward both legislative.,185,,
1120,0.97,8975.333,8984.942,"I want to thank Mayor Harrell to collaborate today's compromise, once again demonstrated skill at finding common ground.",185,,
1121,0.97,8984.942,8992.35,"This was timely, healthy, necessary for a process and good Governance in our diverse city.",185,,
1122,0.97,8992.35,9024.582,"This amendment resolution and amendment Council bill removing expenses and enhanced recruitment can serve as acceptable first step, sturdy shovel to dig ourselves out of public safety created every the past two years, exit interviews of SPD air forces reveal specific theme and I am hoping some of the actions serve to Rebalance some of that so officers do feel more supported.",185,,
1123,0.97,9024.582,9029.353,I believe we must also acknowledge that summer is coming.,185,,
1124,0.97,9029.353,9032.056,It will be here in 40 days.,185,,
1125,0.97,9032.056,9058.849,We know that historically summer brings a spike in crime and gun violence and the spike coincides with warmer months when hundreds of thousands of Seattle residents deserve to feel safe to enjoy the city parks such as where the city hopes for a July 4TH celebration.,185,,
1126,0.97,9058.849,9062.386,We must reform the police Union contract.,185,,
1127,0.97,9062.386,9068.292,A staffing shortage at SPD is so severe that we will need more than a shovel to dig ourselves out.,185,,
1128,0.97,9068.292,9070.961,We'll need a high speed elevator and we need it soon.,185,,
1129,0.97,9070.961,9093.584,"I look forward to us receiving from the Mayor's office and SPD a bigger bolder recruitment retention plan with details ready to implement for Acleaving success, hire, keep our front line public safety workers in Seattle before summer crime spike is upon us.",185,,
1130,0.97,9093.584,9095.152,Thank you.,185,,
1131,0.97,9095.152,9095.453,Thank you.,185,,
1132,0.97,9095.453,9095.92,Councilmember Lewis.,185,,
1133,0.97,9095.92,9100.891,"Thank you, Madam chair.",186,,
1134,0.97,9100.891,9134.425,Similar to Councilmember Pedersen's remarks I appreciate the convening of Mayor's office in reconciling perceived differences between resolution and ordinance and harmonizing proposals into the United proposal we have in front of us it's a really important symbol not only for the police Department but for the city as a whole to see a functioning United productive Seattle City Hall relative to the conflicts between executive and legislative branches over the last two years.,186,,
1135,0.97,9134.425,9147.204,As we have discussed in several respects today it has resulted in a public safety situation in the city that is at a very high level of acute of crisis.,186,,
1136,0.97,9147.204,9167.558,I appreciate this approach and look forward to Mayor Harrell transmitting additional steps in accordance with what we are requesting in the resolution and implementing resources that the city council is proposing to unlock via these proposals today.,186,,
1137,0.97,9167.558,9180.638,"Building off of some of Councilmember Mosqueda's comments, I can continue on and cite a lot of the Statistics about pure cities.",186,,
1138,0.97,9180.638,9181.739,Even more recent statistics.,186,,
1139,0.97,9181.739,9192.283,New Orleans is losing 50 police officers or has lost 50 police officers in 2022 alone so far.,186,,
1140,0.97,9192.283,9206.764,"Dallas in Texas, perceived as a more police friendly jurisdiction, in the middle of 2021 lost 144 officers and only replaced with 77 new recruits.",186,,
1141,0.97,9206.764,9220.077,"San Diego, a more conservative jurisdiction in California as of March 14 this year had been losing 20 officers per month so far throughout 2022.",186,,
1142,0.97,9220.077,9224.682,So this is a national crisis with police hiring and retention.,186,,
1143,0.97,9224.682,9251.242,"Part of what it puts front and center really is the previous conversation the Council was having about the need to develop and invest in, scale certain response alternatives to free up officers for jobs that that are only able to do.",186,,
1144,0.97,9251.242,9262.219,We can look at retrenchment and how Seattle of city managers its caseload and work with the resources allowed to us.,186,,
1145,0.97,9262.219,9269.526,The city that is going to be successful in the future in the United States is going to be the city that honestly confronts and takes home that work.,186,,
1146,0.97,9269.526,9279.203,There is no way we are going to replace all the officers that the city has lost within one year.,186,,
1147,0.97,9279.203,9302.826,We have a hiring target of 98 officers but we need to do everything in our power as these measures are doing to lead the hiring or potentially exceed it but we need to go forward with the realization that we will not replace the officers that the city has been losing within the next 24 months.,186,,
1148,0.97,9302.826,9309.233,We still have things the community expects us to respond to that we need to.,186,,
1149,0.97,9309.233,9335.192,The critical thing we need to keep centered that I know has been a difficult Contextual thing to discuss is that recruiting was alleging in the decade preceding our recent hiring shortfall and challenges in the period post consent Decreeofficer hiring has always been close to fairly attrition al.,186,,
1150,0.97,9335.192,9335.492,In and out.,186,,
1151,0.97,9335.492,9348.305,As we see it is an extremely high acute of hiring one person for those we are losing.,186,,
1152,0.97,9348.305,9366.557,"Front and center, even at times when we had better one for one replacement recruiting, we still had volumes of unmet response in the community because we need alternative methods of responding and mitigating effects on the community.",186,,
1153,0.97,9366.557,9386.343,I wanted to Reecho that to commit to the shared yes approach emphasized that we need to be committed and determined and put in every effort and resource to enhance police recruiting.,186,,
1154,0.97,9386.343,9399.523,"It is also absolutely necessary if we want an adequate first response, that we develop and build up alternative ways to respond to and do functions that historically have been done exclusively by Seattle police officers.",186,,
1155,0.97,9399.523,9404.161,With that I look forward to voting for this ordinance.,186,,
1156,0.97,9404.161,9416.306,I appreciate the opportunity to vote for the resolution earlier and look forward to the full members at Council.,186,,
1157,0.97,9416.306,9416.84,Councilmember Nelson.,187,,
1158,0.97,9416.84,9423.447,"First, I wanted to say I appreciated your friendly amendment to my resolution back there.",188,,
1159,0.97,9423.447,9431.555,I was not able to convey that I believe that strength end my legislation.,188,,
1160,0.97,9431.555,9444.201,Thank you very much for coming together with me to further this direction that we've got to do something about public safety.,188,,
1161,0.97,9444.201,9450.674,The details don't make as much difference than the fact that we are doing something right now to address this.,188,,
1162,0.97,9450.674,9465.823,We are signaling to potential recruits to existing officers that public safety is of importance and also showing our constituents we are responding to their concerns.,188,,
1163,0.97,9465.823,9481.371,The appreciate the opportunity to vote for this today and look forward to working with you and the executive going forward on whatever steps may come.,188,,
1164,0.97,9481.371,9481.972,Thank you.,188,,
1165,0.97,9481.972,9482.806,"Councilmember Nelson, Mosqueda.",189,,
1166,0.97,9482.806,9489.58,I really appreciate the opportunity to Piggyback on Councilmember Lewis.,190,,
1167,0.97,9489.58,9496.687,I appreciate the ongoing effort that will happen after today for the alternative responses.,190,,
1168,0.97,9496.687,9511.268,I want to direct us to the really poll where it said 92% of respondents said if they could direct where tax dollars went they would spend on helping folks with addiction issues and mental health supports and services.,190,,
1169,0.97,9511.268,9518.475,We have an opportunity going forward in upcoming budget to do more of that and really Prioritize funding in that way.,190,,
1170,0.97,9518.475,9524.381,That is one of the reasons as I noted.,190,,
1171,0.97,9524.381,9540.664,I think if the legislation goes forward there are two follow up requests I would have of the executive and I want to thank as well for example the Senator deputy Mayor and the Mayor as well for keeping much open door to how we address the issues together.,190,,
1172,0.97,9540.664,9561.051,One of the questions I would like to make sure we address is the equity issue between departments recognizing SPD has largest budget in our city's general Fund and how smaller departments will make comparable offers if moving offers are put forward.,190,,
1173,0.97,9561.051,9567.324,I would love to see what we have in mind to assist with equity announcements.,190,,
1174,0.97,9567.324,9573.997,I would love a follow up from executive or SPD as we think about recruitment.,190,,
1175,0.97,9573.997,9580.837,That's important but also retention and especially compliance with existing requirements for existing officers.,190,,
1176,0.97,9580.837,9591.381,"As noted in Seattle times article of the 86 officers involved in the May day protest a number had mask violations, refused to wear mask.",190,,
1177,0.97,9591.381,9608.865,When labor and industries tried to investigate not only the mask violations but concern among folks who experienced officers not wearing masks and were met with retaliation or dismiss Civness.,190,,
1178,0.97,9608.865,9629.519,Labor and industries state safety inspectors report SPD and safety officers there Accessing SPD files even after approved by lieutenant and inspections showed their government identification.,190,,
1179,0.97,9629.519,9642.232,July report show that officers claim they never heard and the report said officers routinely disobeyed direct orders to wear masks and observe social distancing.,190,,
1180,0.97,9642.232,9675.132,"As we think about the number of officers not available, the number on extended leave, I am interested in knowing what executive strategy and Department strategy is to ensure compliance with health and safety regulations, increase vaccination rates and at the least make sure that we are not just trying to look at who is coming in the door but how we are maintaining requirements for existing officers to comply with health and safety which will yield more folks available to be deployed.",190,,
1181,0.97,9675.132,9681.805,Those are the follow UPS that I had.,190,,
1182,0.97,9681.805,9682.172,Thank you.,191,,
1183,0.97,9682.172,9696.82,All good things to keep an eye on moving forward as Sdhr looks at changing the rule about relocation cost of the foundation.,191,,
1184,0.97,9696.82,9719.676,"Our effort is about equity so we should definitely track how our goals are implemented and whether or not they are realized as making offers to recruited public servants, whether or not we are making them more equitable policy and approach to doing so.",191,,
1185,0.97,9719.676,9724.848,Thank you for that.,191,,
1186,0.97,9724.848,9753.143,"Thank you also for recognizing the shocking, I think, revelation of the lack of adherence and disregard for masking policies that were in place in the state of Washington for addressing prevention and another way of keeping the public safe which is a core responsibility of police officers.",191,,
1187,0.97,9753.143,9761.852,Refusal to wear mask and refusal to cooperate with investigations around mask wearing I found very shocking.,191,,
1188,0.97,9761.852,9770.393,Thank you for lifting that as a core element of the law enforcement Commission.,191,,
1189,0.97,9770.393,9774.865,Closing remarks before we call for a vote on my bill here?,191,,
1190,0.97,9774.865,9803.293,"I really want to thank my colleagues for noting challenges other cities have faced in sworn officer staffing, the fact that it's a national issue around recruitment of police officers, the fact that we actually, and that is actually happening within context of the great resignation which touches all job sectors.",191,,
1191,0.97,9803.293,9807.43,We need to figure out how to recruit smarter.,191,,
1192,0.97,9807.43,9851.141,I also want to recognize that I wholeheartedly agree with the comments made by colleagues that the staffing challenges at the police Department not only means that we need to address our recruitment practices and be smarter about how we recruit people to serve the public but that we need to develop alternatives to ensure that officers that we do have are able to respond to the most pressing public safety threats that only they can respond to.,191,,
1193,0.97,9851.141,9860.75,The commitment is a very welcome step and I appreciate the Mayor's role in the development of the two pieces of legislation before us today.,191,,
1194,0.97,9860.75,9867.624,"For the bill, giving funding for SPD hiring plan, it is in the 2022 budget already.",191,,
1195,0.97,9867.624,9879.402,I believe it does make sense to take the step that can facilitate meeting the hiring plan even though it is now only 98 officers.,191,,
1196,0.97,9879.402,9911.701,"I recognize that that is approximately a quarter of the value of, the current value of the salary savings proviso and look forward to ongoing conversations about how to Strategize around the funds to address a variety of needs under the budget chair's direction.",191,,
1197,0.97,9911.701,9927.717,Resolution adopted earlier helped set the stage for what will be forthcoming about staffing incentives and I think recognizes Council's authority in lifting or modifying proviso.,191,,
1198,0.97,9927.717,9944.1,The details are very important when we modify proviso because when we proviso funds it's because we have decided we want to see how the dollars will be spent.,191,,
1199,0.97,9944.1,9944.701,So the details matter.,191,,
1200,0.97,9944.701,9956.279,"With that, I appreciate the support of my colleagues on the vote and look forward to bringing this to full council.",191,,
