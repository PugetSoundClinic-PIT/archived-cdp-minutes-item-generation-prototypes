64,0.97,221.754,230.697,Council member Herbolt is the lead sponsor on this bill so I will yield the floor to her to allow her an opportunity to address the bill first.,43,,
65,0.97,230.697,237.67,I understand there's also an amendment Why don't with go ahead and address the bill first and then we will consider the amendment.,43,,
66,0.97,237.67,241.708,"Fantastic, thank you.",44,,
67,0.97,241.708,261.995,This legislation builds off of the rent for commercial tenants that Mayor Durkan proposed a number of weeks ago and is intended to address the sort of inherent tension between that moratorium and the fact that rent is still due for folks.,44,,
68,0.97,261.995,276.175,It establishes a way for property owners to get paid and for small businesses and Nonprofits to minimize their rent debt as it may accumulate over the period of this crisis.,44,,
69,0.97,276.175,282.915,My office has heard from small businesses concerned about their ability to survive the public health emergency.,44,,
70,0.97,282.915,293.226,I'm sure many other Council members have heard those stories as well.,44,,
71,0.97,293.226,303.336,Seattle times writer Danny Wesnead wrote a story recently that I think reflects a lot of what we see happening across the city.,44,,
72,0.97,303.336,330.129,The difference between property owners who are being very generous and understanding in creating the time and space that's necessary for tenants to pay the rent and other responses that are much more string Gent and not really appreciative of the crisis that we're in right now.,44,,
73,0.97,330.129,344.544,"Number of months ago, I'm sorry a number of weeks ago a coalition of small business owners led by Mulitzo reached out to Council members early on to propose ways that the city could help more small businesses survive.",44,,
74,0.97,344.544,349.115,This was one of those ideas contained in that letter.,44,,
75,0.97,349.115,353.419,Requiring rent payments to be payable over longer periods of time.,44,,
76,0.97,353.419,370.77,"In developing the legislation I consulted with other additional small business owners, including Joe Crusear to develop Pizza and Beto yards of venture as nonprofit that supports entrepreneurs as I said it was limited resources and unlimited potential.",44,,
77,0.97,370.77,377.076,And they provided a lot of feed back and good ideas that we worked to incorporate.,44,,
78,0.97,377.076,386.652,I have just a short closing statement that I would like to also say at the end if that's okay.,44,,
79,0.97,386.652,389.088,After we work on the amendment.,44,,
80,0.97,389.088,391.824,That is fine.,45,,
81,0.97,391.824,400.767,So why don't we go ahead and take up the amendment which is amendment one on the agenda.,45,,
82,0.97,400.767,410.41,Why don't we go ahead and take that up and we will consider the amendment and we will have comments on the bill as amended after we reconsider the amendment.,45,,
83,0.97,410.41,414.113,How does that sound?,45,,
84,0.97,414.113,414.313,Okay.,45,,
85,0.97,414.313,416.115,Great.,45,,
86,0.97,416.115,419.418,"Would you like to, formally move your amend?",45,,

90,0.97,423.556,428.528,Let me go through the Roberts rules of order before we can provide.,49,,
91,0.97,428.528,430.93,It's been moved and Seconded.,49,,
92,0.97,430.93,433.733,Council member Herbolt will now address amendment one.,49,,
93,0.97,433.733,449.048,So amendment one came out of some work with Naop Washington commercial Legislations.,50,,
94,0.97,449.048,461.027,Businesses will need to have experienced an economic hardship either because they were forced to stop doing business or because their revenue dropped by 30% or more as compared to the previous year.,50,,
95,0.97,461.027,471.504,The amendment also clarifies that local Outpostf large chains would not be eligible even if they Have50% or fewer employees.,50,,
96,0.97,471.504,480.88,We've been careful to make sure that small franchises will still be eligible.,50,,
97,0.97,480.88,496.863,The goal is to ensure when we're talking about helping small businesses survive we're focusing on the businesses most likely to need help to do so and not opening the doors to businesses who don't really need the protection.,50,,
98,0.97,496.863,520.519,"I appreciate the fact that an organization that is devoted to the interest of commercial real estate has been willing to come forward and recognize the need for this legislation while making some, recommendations that I feel are reasonable.",50,,
99,0.97,520.519,542.108,"Thank you, are there any questions or comments on amendment one to Council bill 11976 looks like there's no questions or comments so will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of amendment one.",51,,

115,0.97,574.607,580.246,The motion carries and the amendment is adopted.,67,,
116,0.97,580.246,592.758,Before Council member Herbolt makes her final comments are there any other further comments from any of my other colleagues on the bill as amended.,67,,
117,0.97,592.758,593.259,Council member Morales.,67,,
118,0.97,593.259,600.8,I do just want to make a quick comment.,68,,
119,0.97,600.8,606.272,As Council member Herbold says we've been looking at small business constituents.,68,,
120,0.97,606.272,612.712,We know that commercial tenants have almost no rights and our small businesses need protection.,68,,
121,0.97,612.712,621.687,Especially during this emergency so that they have some kind of chance to come back once we are in recovery.,68,,
122,0.97,621.687,632.064,"So, as Council member Herbold said this isn't complete rent forgiveness it's just a freeze on increases and they have a year but they can't pay the money back.",68,,
123,0.97,632.064,647.813,So we know that small business already taking a big risk.,68,,
124,0.97,647.813,656.322,"Regardless of what business they're doing, we know our small businesses bring a lot to our communities.",68,,
125,0.97,656.322,659.592,So we are happy to do anything to help them.,68,,
126,0.97,659.592,666.766,Council member Herbold I just want to say thank you so much for the introduction of this bill.,69,,
127,0.97,666.766,675.007,I think it is a very fine compliment to some of the work we're seeing in this landmark tenant space.,69,,
128,0.97,675.007,694.326,"As it relates to residential, tendencies and I will have a full bill later this month that effectively does the whole thing this bill does but in the residential category of tendencies.",69,,
129,0.97,694.326,713.779,Anything we can do to create as much stability as we can in this space is going to be absolutely critical to making sure that we allow people the best opportunity to see the light at the end of the tunnel once we hopefully and I believe we will get through this public health crisis.,69,,
130,0.97,713.779,720.619,So I'm going to let you have the final word before we call this bill to a vote.,69,,
131,0.97,720.619,723.389,"Yeah, just a personal note.",70,,
132,0.97,723.389,745.311,That again I know everybody who represents the District or even our at large Council members share this really personal feeling that our district and our city is so so benefited by just an incredible array of truly beloved small businesses.,70,,
133,0.97,745.311,757.123,It's really our small businesses are really what gives our city vitality and make our neighborhoods such wonderful places to live.,70,,
134,0.97,757.123,764.23,I really believe that we cannot let the Coronavirus attack what makes our communities so special.,70,,
135,0.97,764.23,772.938,And the hope is this legislation will give these beloved small businesses and essential Nonprofits a fighting chance to survive.,70,,
136,0.97,772.938,785.885,One of the things that folks have reminded me is that we do that small businesses do have financial relief coming to them many folks have applied.,70,,
137,0.97,785.885,802.168,"But again, although that financial relief is coming, we don't know how much of the, how much the relief will mitigate as it relates to the financial impacts of this, of this virus.",70,,
138,0.97,802.168,810.809,Nor do we know necessarily the timing when people receive funds.,70,,
139,0.97,810.809,814.713,So this bill will allow people to buy some time.,70,,
140,0.97,814.713,826.625,And it allows them to enter into a time payment plan of six months after the end of the crisis and allows them a full year to pay off their rent.,70,,
141,0.97,826.625,840.239,In addition to as we mentioned before freezing rents on the types of leases that don't have multi year commitments for rent increases within them themselves.,70,,
142,0.97,840.239,843.275,Thank you everybody for working with me on this bill.,70,,
143,0.97,843.275,855.821,I think that it's a really good example of the types of things we can do to address the needs of our constitutions that we care so deeply about.,70,,
144,0.97,855.821,857.623,Well said Council member Herbold.,71,,
145,0.97,857.623,860.092,Let's go ahead and get this bill into law.,71,,

189,0.97,1085.617,1096.428,In order to formally include these child care services.,95,,
190,0.97,1096.428,1127.226,To Council amendment that levy's implementation and evaluation plan and total expenditures under child care services is limited to the amend of funds that otherwise would have been used to fund the Seattle preschool program during the same period of time all contracts will be effective for 30 days.,95,,
191,0.97,1127.226,1152.651,The proposed bill would define the child care with adequate education services defined in the enabling Ordnance and that this bill would also declare that there is an immediate need for essential workers to have access to child care services and it would ratify and confirm the Mayor's emergency order.,95,,
192,0.97,1152.651,1188.22,The proposed bill attaches as attachment two that is listed on this agenda an emergency Addendum to the implementation plan that States that child care will be paid for funds that would go to support the preschool program and path way program.,95,,
193,0.97,1188.22,1199.865,"However with the closure of schools and the governor's stay at home order, many of the Spp and Spp path way programs are not currently in operation.",95,,
194,0.97,1199.865,1206.872,That means that levee funds are available to be redirected to support these emergency child care services.,95,,
195,0.97,1206.872,1219.218,Importantly the executive cannot exceed in the amount I equivalent to the levee.,95,,
196,0.97,1219.218,1230.662,Future years of the Spp path way programs will continue to be fully funded as originally intended in the implementation and emergency plan we adopted in the spring of 2019.,95,,
197,0.97,1230.662,1252.718,"And then Lastly, I did receive written confirmation that the oversight committee was consulted as required by law and the oversight committee agreed that the implementation of emergency services is an appropriate use of fact levy funds during this civil emergency.",95,,
198,0.97,1252.718,1272.004,Out of an abundance of caution I wanted to make sure we had this bill before us to make sure we continue to have the accountability and oversight necessary for the expenditure of these important but limited taxpayer approved levy fund in the space of early learning.,95,,
199,0.97,1272.004,1280.779,So that is the structure of the bill and what is before us and what this bill will do.,95,,
200,0.97,1280.779,1284.182,Council member Herbold has an amendment she would like to make.,95,,
201,0.97,1284.182,1302.067,I'm going to hand it over to Council member Herbold to formally introduce her amendment and then we will take up her amendment and then come back to the substantive bill as amended for comments.,95,,

209,0.97,1319.384,1319.651,Sure.,99,,
210,0.97,1319.651,1326.224,So this amendment just simply requires a monthly report from the executive on the emergency child care efforts.,99,,
211,0.97,1326.224,1351.249,"I've been hearing from people and in my personal network that today in the efforts of both SPs, Seattle public schools as well as deal that the demand for child care for the identified populations has not been what they initially expected and of course we know that one thing that often happens is once it's provided then the demand grows.",99,,
212,0.97,1351.249,1377.309,"And I just want to make sure that, sights don't end up having excess capacity and that there be consideration to expanding child care, child care provision to other groups of essential workers for instance transit workers.",99,,
213,0.97,1377.309,1381.012,The folks who are putting their Self-In harms way.,99,,
214,0.97,1381.012,1384.516,To do the essential work of getting people around.,99,,
215,0.97,1384.516,1389.921,As we'll as our homeless service providers that are on the front lines.,99,,
216,0.97,1389.921,1395.794,Just want to make sure that there's excess capacity was in the system.,99,,
217,0.97,1395.794,1399.898,That there's an ability to serve more families.,99,,
218,0.97,1399.898,1408.273,And so the required monthly reports from the executive includes the number of emergency child care sites currently operating in their locations.,99,,
219,0.97,1408.273,1409.775,The number of staff at each site.,99,,
220,0.97,1409.775,1415.413,The number of students at each site.,99,,
221,0.97,1415.413,1427.659,Including Disaggregation by the type of worker that the parents of those students perform.,99,,
222,0.97,1427.659,1433.532,And impact to from redirecting resources to emergency health care services.,99,,

247,0.97,1496.361,1497.729,"Nine in favor, none opposed.",118,,
248,0.97,1497.729,1501.5,The motion carries and the amendment is adopted.,119,,
249,0.97,1501.5,1508.54,Colleagues are there any further comments on the bill as amended?,119,,
250,0.97,1508.54,1509.875,Council member Herbold the floor is yours.,119,,
251,0.97,1509.875,1522.254,"Thank you, this is more of a flagging of an issue and Council member Gonzalez you may know whether or not deal is planning to address this.",120,,
252,0.97,1522.254,1536.501,"But, one of the issues I think that was in some ways raised in the letter from the Advisory board, relates specifically to a really important equity issue.",120,,
253,0.97,1536.501,1544.843,Given that child care providers provide care for the children of doctors and nurses who are on the front lines and exposed to Coronavirus every day.,120,,
254,0.97,1544.843,1554.352,"And through the children that they're caring for, child care workers are facing the same exposures.",120,,
255,0.97,1554.352,1559.925,And there's been a movement toward hazard pay for grocery workers.,120,,
256,0.97,1559.925,1562.861,Hazard pay for homeless service providers.,120,,
257,0.97,1562.861,1579.244,And I'm just wondering if the Department is considering whether or not to consider hazard pay for this group of professionals that are doing essential work that is critical to the functions of our first responders.,120,,
258,0.97,1579.244,1582.814,I do not know the answer to that question.,121,,
259,0.97,1582.814,1586.451,I know that the question has been posed.,121,,
260,0.97,1586.451,1589.621,I think it's an important question.,121,,
261,0.97,1589.621,1598.129,And I know that there's been at least as it relates to the contracts with child care providers in school public school buildings.,121,,
262,0.97,1598.129,1610.575,There's been a lot of conversation about sanitation and how to make sure that the environment is as safe as it can possibly be under the circumstances.,121,,
263,0.97,1610.575,1621.186,But I think that it's an important question to get a follow up information from deal and we'll make sure to do that and circulate it to you.,121,,
264,0.97,1621.186,1621.653,Thank you.,122,,
265,0.97,1621.653,1622.187,You're welcome.,123,,
266,0.97,1622.187,1626.658,Are there any other questions or comments?,124,,
267,0.97,1626.658,1627.726,"Council member Mosqueda, please.",124,,
268,0.97,1627.726,1628.46,Thank you Council President.,125,,
269,0.97,1628.46,1631.296,Thank you for your work on this legislation.,125,,
270,0.97,1631.296,1633.064,And thanks for the Mayor's office for sending it down.,125,,
271,0.97,1633.064,1649.08,I agree with all of the comments that Council member Herbold just outlined as far as who need these services.,125,,
272,0.97,1649.08,1665.163,And director Chapell has received an E-mail who are contract workers who provide child care to individuals throughout the city and Sciu represents family health care providers throughout the city.,125,,
273,0.97,1665.163,1679.644,"I am hoping they will continue to be used as an important resource in this effort to make sure all of the essential workers have access to high quality child care, for the current population and for any expanded population.",125,,
274,0.97,1679.644,1695.06,"Just I want to note from the E- mail they sent, they note the city of Seattle has a strong labor history and Sciu wants to help provide workers throughout the region with access to high quality child care.",125,,
275,0.97,1695.06,1703.401,And also make sure they're Accessing high quality health care for those who are organized and have a voice in their job.,125,,
276,0.97,1703.401,1720.852,We know how important it is for people to raise their hand if they feel unsafe at their place of employment that's true from the health care workers to removing the 5- cent fee for bags and includes child care provide to make sure their services are across the city.,125,,
277,0.97,1720.852,1736.034,"Just want to ping that for our Department as they're looking to deploy Phot, not just our city dollars and look forward to their ongoing.",125,,
278,0.97,1736.034,1739.838,Thank you for though comments really appreciate the note there.,126,,
279,0.97,1739.838,1759.491,"I will say that in my conversations with the executive it's my understanding that there's, they are looking at the, every single opportunity they can to figure out how to meet child care need for essential workers.",126,,
280,0.97,1759.491,1783.081,So that includes just contractors in center based facilities but you know sort of making sure we're keeping an eye on how we can make sure that the system is being fully responsive and I think that the amendment that was advanced by Council member Herbold that we just adopted is going to help us fine tune exactly where the gaps are to be that there are gaps.,126,,
281,0.97,1783.081,1796.594,So I think those data points will be absolutely critical to understanding how else we can modify the model in order to meet this critical need for these workers.,126,,
282,0.97,1796.594,1801.9,Are there any other questions or comments from my colleagues?,126,,
283,0.97,1801.9,1802.4,Okay.,127,,
284,0.97,1802.4,1803.835,Hearing none.,127,,
285,0.97,1803.835,1811.109,I just want to say that I'm really excited that we can advance this legislation.,127,,
286,0.97,1811.109,1830.828,I'm also mindful of the impact that it can have on levee existing levee funds and programs and services that we fund through it that's part of the reason why I wanted to make sure that out of the abundance of caution we had a legislation to formalize this as opposed to just relying on an executive order.,127,,
287,0.97,1830.828,1847.579,I think it's important to us to have that accountability and transparency on how these dollars are going to be spent and having additional details out in the public about our expectations about how the executive order was going to be operational as in this space.,127,,
288,0.97,1847.579,1855.753,"I will say that, that doing this work just really highlights for me that we still have an absolute crisis around child care in our city.",127,,
289,0.97,1855.753,1865.296,"It's part of the reason why we're scrambling so it's not, not just a crisis for these essential workers but for everybody.",127,,
290,0.97,1865.296,1898.196,"And I think we're seeing that during a period of a public health crisis and pandemic like this, we are experiencing the gaps in our child care system in an even deeper more profound way and that's part of the reason why I've been working with so many of you and former Council colleagues on really, really making sure that we're having a conversation about how to best meet the needs of working families who have children in our cities.",127,,
291,0.97,1898.196,1904.135,"So I think this is a good step, good step forward for this small body of workers.",127,,
292,0.97,1904.135,1915.213,But look forward to being on the other side of this Coronavirus and continuing to have a conversation about how we close the gaps in the child care space.,127,,
293,0.97,1915.213,1916.547,In the long term.,127,,
294,0.97,1916.547,1918.116,So with that being said.,127,,
295,0.97,1918.116,1927.592,I am going to ask the clerk to call the roll on the passage of he bill as amended.,127,,

328,0.97,2033.264,2043.141,This legislation will Temp Raeurply suspend deadlines required in the Seattle municipal court for the office of the city Examiner due to the Coronavirus emergency.,151,,
329,0.97,2043.141,2054.986,In response to the the orders our hearing Examiner published emergency rules to provide guidance for the office of the hearing Examiner during the Covid-19 emergency.,151,,
330,0.97,2054.986,2078.676,"Those rules were to be in effect for 60 days and include closure of his office to the public, allowing remote hearings, allowing electronic filing of documents suspending in person payment of fees and allowing persons to pay their fees later if the office closure prevented payment from being made.",151,,
331,0.97,2078.676,2086.851,These are all important to help prevent the further spread of the Coronavirus to the public and to the hearing Examiner staff.,151,,
332,0.97,2086.851,2100.364,Of course the city of the office Examiner is an independent office and they require this bill in order to have the flexibility needed to continue to comply with these public health orders.,151,,
333,0.97,2100.364,2108.873,Council bill 119770 119770 will temporarily suspend.,151,,
334,0.97,2108.873,2132.53,"It's important for for me to note that this bill does not suspend deadlines applicable to city departments in cases that come before the hearing Examiner and this bill only provide the hearing Examiner really from the stringent deadlines that will make it difficult for the office of city examiners to comply for the governor stay home, stay healthy order.",151,,
335,0.97,2132.53,2155.62,For those of you who took a look at Amy Gore's memo you will NOTE she made sure to highlight that there is that particular issue if we a a Council want to take up the issue at a future date to consider suspending deadlines for city departments or for the other Litany of folks that I just mentioned.,151,,
336,0.97,2155.62,2165.63,We could do that but Council central staff has identified that it would be appropriate to consider that temporary policy relief or shift in the separate and newly introduced bill.,151,,
337,0.97,2165.63,2182.513,So I will have conversations with the hearing Examiner to see IFS that something that makes sense from a policy perspective and happy to hear from any of you all at a future date as to whether or not that is a policy shift that would be of interest.,151,,
338,0.97,2182.513,2188.853,S that the essence of this bill and I'm happy to entertain any comments.,151,,
