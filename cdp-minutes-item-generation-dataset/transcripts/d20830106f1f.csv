649,0.97,4011.574,4034.196,"Yes, thank you very much, I appreciate the opportunity to talk with the committee about progress we made about one of the new initiatives that we have been involved with since 2018 to bring updates on some of the things we have been able to do in the world of affordable housing.",118,,
650,0.97,4034.196,4049.278,"We look forward to sharing with you that progress, and somebody would be available to Delve into any additional questions you might have, we can finish the presentation.",118,,
651,0.97,4049.278,4055.951,"Things, I know we have a presentation Pull-Up, here, Tracy, I will turn it over to you to see if there is anything to add.",119,,
652,0.97,4055.951,4094.79,"And we were having a conversation in December, and director Lofton, you are giving us what Seattle housing authority has been involved with, just an update on the tremendous work you have done, not only with implementing strategies that bring back folks who development areas who have previously been displaced as you think about the lowest income neighbors in the Seattle housing authority, who they seek to serve, we created a system to prevent displacement for housing and new opportunities.",119,,
653,0.97,4094.79,4130.526,"Mixed housing opportunities--there are great examples we have asked you here today to highlight to set the tone for what could possibly be on our agenda this year as we think about taking these strategies and amplifying them especially as it relates to strategic acquisition and acquiring new priorities so we can drive down the cost of the land and provide truly affordable housing and housing opportunities to our residents and neighbors who had previously been excluded from these opportunities, so folks, this was our chance to really set the tone for housing frame that could inform future discussions, we are right on time, we have about until 3:30, I will turn it back over to director Laughlin, seeing a nod from Tracy, we will let you talk a status update.",119,,
654,0.97,4130.526,4130.926,Okay.,120,,
655,0.97,4130.926,4133.028,I'm going to try to share my screen.,120,,
656,0.97,4133.028,4138.801,I'm probably not the best person to do the technological piece of this.,120,,
657,0.97,4138.801,4140.536,"We will get our way through it, I hope.",120,,
658,0.97,4140.536,4141.604,Can you see the screen?,120,,
659,0.97,4141.604,4146.342,"Yes, we can.",121,,
660,0.97,4146.342,4171.634,"So we are going to try to walk you through, very quickly, progress for the terrace and development, giving the background of our presentation program, we have talked just briefly about the most recent acquisition under that program, the Commons, we will give you a sense of where we are with that, that is a significant project that will require a Point-And-Shoot with the city.",122,,
661,0.97,4171.634,4177.072,We are very excited about that opportunity that it brings for the city as well as the neighborhood.,122,,
662,0.97,4177.072,4201.297,"I'm going to ask rod Brandon, who is the director of housing operations to talk a little bit about the people side of the development, then I will turn it over to Terry, he will give you an update on the physical progress of the project.",122,,
663,0.97,4201.297,4217.279,"Then Jared, who is the director of the housing Finance unit will talk about the acquisition and preservation and why we got involved in that program, and what we believe has been a tremendous success.",122,,
664,0.97,4217.279,4238.701,"As you recall, Yesler terrace is a major redevelopment . What we tend to lose sight of you is the fundamental core of redevelopment is about the ability to assist our residents and to help them in their ability to succeed.",122,,
665,0.97,4238.701,4256.018,"In combination with the physical development [Indiscernible] succeeding with our residents, programs that would support their ongoing success.",122,,
666,0.97,4256.018,4272.534,"That's what we mean by the people's side, aching sure they have good health outcomes, making sure they have access to great education, making sure that they can compete in the economic setting of Seattle as well.",122,,
667,0.97,4272.534,4278.274,"With that, let me let rod run through these very quickly.",122,,
668,0.97,4278.274,4282.444,Carrie will give you an update on where we are with the development.,122,,
669,0.97,4282.444,4284.58,"Thank you, Andrew, for that.",123,,
670,0.97,4284.58,4290.619,"Thank you, Council, for once again inviting us to share the good work we are doing at Yesler.",123,,
671,0.97,4290.619,4297.459,I'm really glad the order of the slides are like this.,123,,
672,0.97,4297.459,4300.863,A lot of times in the presentation you want to see the Brick-And-Mortar of the projects.,123,,
673,0.97,4300.863,4301.53,The people come afterwards.,123,,
674,0.97,4301.53,4311.206,It is nice to see that the people which we have emphasized throughout the Yesler project have been coming 1ST for us.,123,,
675,0.97,4311.206,4314.109,It has been resident centric from day one.,123,,
676,0.97,4314.109,4321.083,"We have been very, very busy recently at Yesler with Covid and the pandemic.",123,,
677,0.97,4321.083,4334.897,We wanted to make sure that our residents there had a chance to access testing sites and access the flu vaccination as it became available.,123,,
678,0.97,4334.897,4336.332,We dropped those services to Yesler.,123,,
679,0.97,4336.332,4339.034,We did not want to encourage folks to seek it on their own.,123,,
680,0.97,4339.034,4347.242,We worked with different medical providers to bring mobile units to Yesler so we can have our residents get tested on site.,123,,
681,0.97,4347.242,4349.545,That has been going on very well so far.,123,,
682,0.97,4349.545,4356.719,We had four different events of various testing.,123,,
683,0.97,4356.719,4360.989,We will continue to pursue that as the vaccination becomes available and finding concrete ways to make that happen as well.,123,,
684,0.97,4360.989,4363.859,We have been doing a Pulitzer of services for our residents.,123,,
685,0.97,4363.859,4369.832,We realize that the pandemic has hit in a number of ways.,123,,
686,0.97,4369.832,4385.18,We looked at ways of checking in our residents and giving them numbers they can call us to check in and see how they are doing.,123,,
687,0.97,4385.18,4395.691,"We are also looking at food delivery programs and other primary supplies that they use for their household, and figuring out ways to partner with folks and private entities to bring that to residents.",123,,
688,0.97,4395.691,4396.959,It has been going really well.,123,,
689,0.97,4396.959,4397.893,Those folks are on site.,123,,
690,0.97,4397.893,4408.17,We look at doing visual events for our youth to keep them active as well as just to keep a tight community.,123,,
691,0.97,4408.17,4428.223,"We have done this through a small newspaper that are artisan residents help facilitate for us to keep good, strong communication within the community.",123,,
692,0.97,4428.223,4430.325,The presence of the black farmers collective has been great.,123,,
693,0.97,4430.325,4436.598,"Having them there, having them continue to show good habits of farming, and informing the residents and producing produce is great.",123,,
694,0.97,4436.598,4438.7,"Seattle schools, local Nonprofits, we partner with them to help students.",123,,
695,0.97,4438.7,4450.746,They are navigating through the challenges of going to school during the pandemic.,123,,
696,0.97,4450.746,4456.118,"We are making sure they do things as they come out to support those families, as they interact with the school system, as well as the kids.",123,,
697,0.97,4456.118,4460.589,"They are trying to figure out how to get their homework done and take breaks throughout the day, engaging in the community.",123,,
698,0.97,4460.589,4475.571,"We continue to keep the community Council involved in the activities that Yesler, as well as the future and ongoing Redevelopments--so those are just a few of the things that our staff is engaged in, and we look forward to doing more and more as time goes on.",123,,
699,0.97,4475.571,4479.741,I'm going to let Terry jump down to relocation.,123,,
700,0.97,4479.741,4487.082,"As you know, relocation has been a very, very big deal for us at Yesler.",123,,
701,0.97,4487.082,4495.891,"When we started relocation in 2013, we wanted to make sure we did it right.",123,,
702,0.97,4495.891,4505.467,"We wanted to take our time, get the residents involved, help them establish their criteria on which things we should be conserving as we navigate and move people around Yesler, off Yesler, and back to Yesler.",123,,
703,0.97,4505.467,4508.103,We made some bold Thomases.,123,,
704,0.97,4508.103,4517.646,We made some promises that focus on every single one of the residents who are at Yesler having a right to return back to Yesler.,123,,
705,0.97,4517.646,4525.32,"So if you choose to come back at any point in time as we Redevelop this community, you have a right to do that.",123,,
706,0.97,4525.32,4526.188,We will make it happen.,123,,
707,0.97,4526.188,4530.726,So we have set procedures in place for that to happen.,123,,
708,0.97,4530.726,4541.303,"We have had 493 households now who have relocated from Yesler, a number of those stayed on site.",123,,
709,0.97,4541.303,4545.34,A number of those went off site.,123,,
710,0.97,4545.34,4550.345,"Then returned--those who went off site, as we continue to check in with them, they are pleased on where they are at.",123,,
711,0.97,4550.345,4561.323,"Those who chose to be off site temporarily and come back, it made it easy for them to come back.",123,,
712,0.97,4561.323,4563.659,They can come back in any phase of Yesler that they choose.,123,,
713,0.97,4563.659,4573.402,"Each time we Redevelop a property at Yesler, we go back over that list, and call them again, invite them again to see if they are interested in coming back to the new Redevelop unit.",123,,
714,0.97,4573.402,4585.747,"So far, roughly about 20 just under 20% of the folks who left Yesler have decided to come back to the new Redevelop to Yesler.",123,,
715,0.97,4585.747,4591.987,A vast majority of them stayed on site and moved around Yesler in a permanent place at Yesler.,123,,
716,0.97,4591.987,4598.493,A question real quick Mama Vice-Chair her belt.,124,,
717,0.97,4598.493,4621.783,"Quickly, sorry, I know the right of return guaranteed to residents at Yesler terrace was a requirement of the cooperative agreement with the city of Seattle past by the city council.",125,,
718,0.97,4621.783,4632.728,I also know that it has been retained in previous MLA's for hope six redevelopment at other sites.,125,,
719,0.97,4632.728,4662.658,"I recall one year, I don't remember if it was Rainier Vista or high point, but one year, there was a city on it, the fulfillment of the obligation to give tenants a right of return, I'm just wondering if, generally, you have done any sort of comparison to the rate of people who have returned at Yesler terrace as to the rate of return for tenants in your other Redevelopments?",125,,
720,0.97,4662.658,4662.924,No.,126,,
721,0.97,4662.924,4667.029,I'm not aware of any.,126,,
722,0.97,4667.029,4668.597,"You know, that's not a bad idea.",126,,
723,0.97,4668.597,4672.567,I'm not aware of any analysis we have done along those lines.,126,,
724,0.97,4672.567,4677.672,"Andrew, are you --",126,,
725,0.97,4677.672,4679.975,I haven't figured out how to a new to myself.,127,,
726,0.97,4679.975,4685.147,I apologize.,127,,
727,0.97,4685.147,4700.162,"Yeah, the project was slightly different than Yesler.",127,,
728,0.97,4700.162,4715.711,We worked with and gave authority to the residents at the time of the projects to determine who and what criteria would be used to allow people to come back.,127,,
729,0.97,4715.711,4718.213,So we followed those criteria in the previous hope six development.,127,,
730,0.97,4718.213,4721.917,Yesler we did do differently.,127,,
731,0.97,4721.917,4728.356,We give a right to return without criteria.,127,,
732,0.97,4728.356,4744.84,"There are different criteria we were using for those right to return commitments, but yes, if you would like to, we could put that information together and look at the hope six information for quite some time as they have been commuting for a while.",127,,
733,0.97,4744.84,4756.151,We can go back and [Indiscernible].,127,,
734,0.97,4756.151,4756.752,Thank you.,128,,
735,0.97,4756.752,4761.923,"In general, it is good to see people exercising their right to return while also respecting their self-determination for where they want to live.",128,,
736,0.97,4761.923,4776.471,"Again, given that there have been so many important investments in these communities, we hope that the folks who once lived there can return and benefit from those deep investments that we have all made in those communities.",128,,
737,0.97,4776.471,4777.672,That is a great point.,129,,
738,0.97,4777.672,4779.541,That is a great point.,129,,
739,0.97,4779.541,4781.243,We are going to do that for them.,129,,
740,0.97,4781.243,4782.577,Thank you for writing that up.,129,,
741,0.97,4782.577,4789.284,"In addition, we just did attention early on to the families.",129,,
742,0.97,4789.284,4799.06,"The families with School-Aged kids--we normally, with three locations, we are not required to give 90 day notice that you are doing relocation, officially.",129,,
743,0.97,4799.06,4799.594,We went beyond that.,129,,
744,0.97,4799.594,4805.367,We took 18 months notice for each of those households.,129,,
745,0.97,4805.367,4816.912,"That gave us send them the time to plan, to think, to make timing work, that worked out on their schedule.",129,,
746,0.97,4816.912,4818.313,We are really glad to do that.,129,,
747,0.97,4818.313,4820.982,We have a lot of good counseling sessions during that window with families.,129,,
748,0.97,4820.982,4823.885,They changed their minds a couple times.,129,,
749,0.97,4823.885,4832.427,That allowed them to do that as they were processing and allowed us to be better prepared to secure an interim home for them.,129,,
750,0.97,4832.427,4837.866,"And then, we try to do everything we can to make sure they were not going to be paying out of pocket for their relocation.",129,,
751,0.97,4837.866,4860.455,"So we took those expenses and made sure that that expense was Bared by us, the sha, and not by them, in cases where they needed to do, sometimes double moves to get to the right location, we took on that expense to make it easy for them.",129,,
752,0.97,4860.455,4866.728,"We took on the extra time to help them, organize, pack, do the things they need to do, so very proud of that, and we will continue to learn from that.",129,,
753,0.97,4866.728,4878.173,"This has been a good model, both for sha and for folks across the country as they reach out to us to admire some of the work we have done in this area, so thank you very much for that.",129,,
754,0.97,4878.173,4899.694,"And just a quick summary for the Council on the relocation, this slide here gives you some of the raw statistics of the 493 households for today, 259--they have now returned and are now living in the Yesler terrace.",129,,
755,0.97,4899.694,4904.833,"There's another 116 who are living off site, living in the sha properties.",129,,
756,0.97,4904.833,4920.682,"Those are generally the folks who are satisfied with their living arrangements, and probably will not exercise the right to return because they are satisfied with where they are, but they still have that right.",129,,
757,0.97,4920.682,4937.799,"There is another 89 households who are living in Non-Sha properties out in the community, Off-Site.",129,,
758,0.97,4937.799,4940.135,"Those, we contact them every time a new building comes Online.",129,,
759,0.97,4940.135,4942.537,They get the chance to exercise their right if they need to.,129,,
760,0.97,4942.537,4943.738,We will continue to do that.,129,,
761,0.97,4943.738,4947.008,There's been about 29 households that have exercise the program for a variety of reasons.,129,,
762,0.97,4947.008,4949.878,We are feeling really good about where we are with relocation.,129,,
763,0.97,4949.878,4951.579,"We have one building that is under construction, now.",129,,
764,0.97,4951.579,4957.953,We will have another 80+ replacement units included in it.,129,,
765,0.97,4957.953,4972.867,We have two additional buildings that are under design that will be completed in the coming years that will complete the replacement housing of all 561 units.,129,,
766,0.97,4972.867,4978.773,"Those are kind of what we said, today, with relocation Stats.",129,,
767,0.97,4978.773,4985.98,"If you would like some additional information on that, we can go down for that in the future.",129,,
768,0.97,4985.98,5002.397,"So let me turn now, if there are no questions about that, to the physical progress and asked Terry to give you a quick update on where we are with the actual physical progress.",129,,
769,0.97,5002.397,5005.7,Thank you very much.,130,,
770,0.97,5005.7,5010.638,"Thank you, Madam chair and committee members.",130,,
771,0.97,5010.638,5020.515,"Really quickly, trying to get through this to respect everyone's time, to date, as we understand, we have completed five buildings.",130,,
772,0.97,5020.515,5028.123,We have completed more than half of the 561 replacement units.,130,,
773,0.97,5028.123,5030.825,They have been built and are occupied on site.,130,,
774,0.97,5030.825,5032.494,So that is a great milestone.,130,,
775,0.97,5032.494,5051.713,"In addition to that, we have built another hundred, what we call regular affordable units on site, we are well on our way to 290, 60% and below units.",130,,
776,0.97,5051.713,5064.726,"One thing we are all very proud of is Yesler completed on site right now, there are 624 income restricted units that are at Yesler right now.",130,,
777,0.97,5064.726,5078.54,"That includes the replacement unit, that includes the additional 60% units we have built as well as the 80% units that market partners have built on site.",130,,
778,0.97,5078.54,5080.141,That is what we are really proud of.,130,,
779,0.97,5080.141,5088.683,"In addition to that, there are 865 additional affordable units in the income restricted units, that are currently in Evelopment.",130,,
780,0.97,5088.683,5093.288,They are either under construction or well into the design permitting process.,130,,
781,0.97,5093.288,5113.608,"So beyond units, there have been more than $50 million invested in infrastructure in the neighborhood, that includes parks, open space, infrastructure, arts programs, and utilities, et cetera.",130,,
782,0.97,5113.608,5132.727,"Getting back to a comment earlier about having our residents reap the benefits of some of those, we have ongoing partnerships with the market developers, we mentioned earlier, they provide quite a few, 80% units on site.",130,,
783,0.97,5132.727,5143.505,"That is continuing to be the story out there, 226 80% units, then market rate units are currently on site.",130,,
784,0.97,5143.505,5151.179,"In addition to that, you might notice, recently, we completed a purchase.",130,,
785,0.97,5151.179,5183.978,"One of the sites with Kaiser Permanente, we are really excited to have them there, going to build a major medical facility at Yesler, you know, more moving towards the vision of Yesler as a mixed income Mixed-Use neighborhood, really hopeful about Partnering with them and having jobs in neighborhoods and diversity [Indiscernible].",130,,
786,0.97,5183.978,5191.553,"[Indiscernible] Jerry is going to run you through that, quickly.",131,,
787,0.97,5191.553,5209.871,"It is an effort that we initiated on behalf of [Indiscernible] to expand the affordable housing Footprint and for the portfolio, we do it in a way we thought was financially prudent as well.",131,,

789,0.97,5210.238,5214.208,"Thank you, Andrew.",132,,
790,0.97,5214.208,5217.812,I apologize if there is some background noise.,132,,
791,0.97,5217.812,5222.016,My neighbor has decided to do some Jackhammering on a Friday afternoon.,132,,
792,0.97,5222.016,5226.921,"If it gets a bit too loud, I might have to turn it back to Andrew to carry on.",132,,
793,0.97,5226.921,5231.025,So please let me know if you're having problems hearing.,132,,
794,0.97,5231.025,5246.441,"So, with the acquisition program in 2018, we set an initial program goal with the board of acquiring 500 units.",132,,
795,0.97,5246.441,5265.36,"Of those 500 units, the goal was to have 50% of the units serve households at or below 30% of variant median incomes, so extremely low income households in the city, and the other 50 serving above [Indiscernible] income.",132,,
796,0.97,5265.36,5276.304,We also established some guiding questions around how we would evaluate properties for acquisition.,132,,
797,0.97,5276.304,5284.078,"Those were based on the six questions on the slide, here.",132,,
798,0.97,5284.078,5302.263,"With our mission and what the goals are for who we serve in the city, serving more low income households is a priority, and therefore, should have been on the acquisition program.",132,,
799,0.97,5302.263,5319.314,"We also wanted to ensure that any acquisition that we brought on did not put the housing authority in a financial position that was not sustainable, because their financial strength is one of the things that allows us to continue to serve more people and extremely low income households as well.",132,,
800,0.97,5319.314,5323.718,We are also looking to always preserve units.,132,,
801,0.97,5323.718,5339.701,"That is both households that are subsidized right now, but also some people refer to it as naturally occurring affordable housing, rapidly being Gentrified in the city.",132,,
802,0.97,5339.701,5343.871,"That was the point of the next question, there.",132,,
803,0.97,5343.871,5356.25,"Then, we are always looking to improve access to neighborhoods and neighborhoods that traditionally low income households have been priced out of.",132,,
804,0.97,5356.25,5360.655,That is where we are looking at high opportunity neighborhoods.,132,,
805,0.97,5360.655,5367.562,"Then, another thing with the Seattle housing authority providing in the city, large family units.",132,,
806,0.97,5367.562,5378.573,"Three, four, and five bedroom units, that is a very difficult unit size to find, especially with the way new construction is going in the city.",132,,
807,0.97,5378.573,5382.276,That was another goal of the program and another criteria that we looked at.,132,,
808,0.97,5382.276,5392.386,"Finally, you know, can we purchase these new units at a lower cost than new development?",132,,
809,0.97,5392.386,5397.492,"If we are buying an older building at a higher cost, the Economics would not make as much sense.",132,,
810,0.97,5397.492,5399.894,"We are always looking for the value, there.",132,,
811,0.97,5399.894,5403.598,"I'm just going to note, we are getting close to the end of our time.",133,,
812,0.97,5403.598,5444.105,"Those last few questions--related to the acquisition, right now, we see the possibility of landlords, small landlords with properties that might go derelict if we don't think of opportunities to purchase them through strategic acquisition policies, we could be missing opportunities for 3 or four bedroom units and affordable units potentially at that if it's done through the Seattle housing authority.",133,,
813,0.97,5444.105,5465.46,It seems like the timing was really good to lift up the ways in which sha has been pursuing this policy especially in the time of the pandemic when we see so much harm and hurt in the local economy so I just wanted to flag that sort of wine now have this discussion and try to elaborate more on options for the city and are Partnering cities in the county to think of these strategic acquisition opportunities is a true Win-Win especially for landlords who might be struggling as well who are looking to sell --,133,,
814,0.97,5465.46,5468.963,"Absolutely, thank you.",134,,
815,0.97,5468.963,5481.075,"So, thus far, we have purchased, in 2018 and 2019, we purchased five properties throughout the city for a total of 540 units.",134,,
816,0.97,5481.075,5490.585,"The total program cost was 112 million with an average of 208,000 per unit.",134,,
817,0.97,5490.585,5499.16,You could see the distribution.,134,,
818,0.97,5499.16,5500.394,We have a number of studios.,134,,
819,0.97,5500.394,5501.395,We have a number of twos.,134,,
820,0.97,5501.395,5503.698,"We were able to get some threes, which is really great.",134,,
821,0.97,5503.698,5527.688,"One thing to note as well, the Mlk apartments as well as golden sunset and the Weller apartments, we partnered with the city on those and received a loan, and acquisition loan for over $50 million that helped offset some of the acquisition cost.",134,,
822,0.97,5527.688,5537.131,"Those properties, the Mlk apartments, sunset and others, they serve households at 30% of their immediate income.",134,,
823,0.97,5537.131,5542.103,They are subsidized property.,134,,
824,0.97,5542.103,5553.414,"Then, Northgate is on there, and we will talk more about that in a bit, then spring line apartments is up in the Lake City neighborhood.",134,,
825,0.97,5553.414,5574.168,"It is under a 70 unit apartment building, 69 units, and it was naturally occurring affordable housing households in the 60 to 70% of the AMI range.",134,,
826,0.97,5574.168,5579.273,"Those households, when we purchased the building, it was 100% occupied, I apologize, none vacant, and those households have remained in place, so that's great.",134,,
827,0.97,5579.273,5604.799,"Excellent, do you mind if I ask us to go to some of the summary slides that you have--the strategies the opportunities you continue to pursue as you go forward?",135,,
828,0.97,5604.799,5615.876,"We would love to come back to the areas you showed, but I'm wondering if there is a big to do item for us to keep our eyes on in 2021.",135,,
829,0.97,5615.876,5617.511,I appreciate the time challenge we have.,136,,
830,0.97,5617.511,5682.376,"With this, I will say that Northgate is an example, an opportunity for the city and sha to address the question of affordable housing both in terms of increasing the supply of affordable housing as well as creating the community that will serve a population that is going to be important for the transit oriented area so we are in conversations now with housing, in partnership with them, we will be coming back to the Council to layout criteria, to lay out our roles, to layout the Timeline for the redevelopment of that project, and the agreement, the goals of what we want to accomplish, and the partnership for the city and sha to make that happen.",136,,
831,0.97,5682.376,5707.401,"So I don't go into Northgate any more than that other than to say that it is a significant project that will come before the Council for your consideration, and it is, as you can see, the core goals and commitments are the kind of things that we think are consistent with priorities as well as priorities as it pertains to affordable housing as it relates to community development as we go forward.",136,,
832,0.97,5707.401,5716.377,"So, I think we can stop there.",136,,
833,0.97,5716.377,5719.947,"If there are questions from the committee or Council members, we would be happy to entertain them.",136,,
834,0.97,5719.947,5721.916,I really appreciate it.,137,,
835,0.97,5721.916,5733.16,"To the entire team, sorry for cutting you short, we appreciate the details provided in the Powerpoint as well, and I want to make sure we get our colleagues out by 4:30 at the latest.",137,,
836,0.97,5733.16,5736.497,"Are there any questions, today?",137,,
837,0.97,5736.497,5745.739,We appreciate as always your expertise and your history as these issues--we are looking at policy and law to make sure these items are being adhered to.,137,,
838,0.97,5745.739,5752.747,"I know you have a long history with tracking these items, please go ahead.",137,,
839,0.97,5752.747,5763.724,"I appreciate knowing from sha that we are going to be hearing more from Northgate, the area is an area that has been on the list of a lot of people who worry about displacement.",138,,
840,0.97,5763.724,5773.0,It's an area that was likely to be sold and Redeveloped.,138,,
841,0.97,5773.0,5775.536,I really appreciate that sha has swooped in and saved the day.,138,,
842,0.97,5775.536,5803.597,"Before we hear more about the Redevelopment plans and the extra inclusion of affordable housing in the future, my question, though, relates to the issue that I know is near and dear to the hearts of my colleagues, Councilmember Mosqueda and Council President Gonzales related to the Childcare at Yesler.",138,,
843,0.97,5803.597,5812.907,The slide earlier showed only a third of the Childcare providers chose to return to Yesler terrace.,138,,
844,0.97,5812.907,5814.542,A lot of those were In-Home Childcare.,138,,
845,0.97,5814.542,5825.486,I'm wondering whether or not there is now a gap in Childcare providers for this community and whether or not we have any work underway to address the need?,138,,
846,0.97,5825.486,5836.931,"You are correct in that that is who has, to date, decided to come back to Yesler.",139,,
847,0.97,5836.931,5849.91,"In the redevelopment of Yesler, a number of Childcare--big day care units were replaced one for one.",139,,
848,0.97,5849.91,5862.623,"The number of units that were used for Daycare at the time of the Redevelopment have been replaced, or will be replaced.",139,,
849,0.97,5862.623,5864.625,"As I recall, there were 26 businesses at that time.",139,,
850,0.97,5864.625,5869.163,So we have 26 units that are equipped to have from Daycare.,139,,
851,0.97,5869.163,5877.238,"Some of them, there have been a few Daycare providers who are happy where they have landed.",139,,
852,0.97,5877.238,5902.496,"While they may not come back, they are still in business, and still providing that service to a different community we do have the capacity to include the same number of Daycare providers that were on the site when we started the redevelopment.",139,,
853,0.97,5902.496,5911.038,"You had the capacity, but that doesn't mean the same number of people of Childcare slots are in operation right now.",140,,
854,0.97,5911.038,5922.116,Some of the units that were able to be used as In-Home Childcare facilities are still able to be used for that purpose.,140,,
855,0.97,5922.116,5923.417,That's correct.,141,,
856,0.97,5923.417,5930.624,Are they reserved for somebody who wants to do that?,142,,
857,0.97,5930.624,5936.53,Or can they be used by someone who has no intention of running a Daycare out of their home?,142,,
858,0.97,5936.53,5938.832,They can be used by someone who has no intention.,143,,
859,0.97,5938.832,5948.842,We would not hold the unit vacant until someone decided to start a Daycare.,143,,
860,0.97,5948.842,5959.253,"But if someone had that intention, we would try to accommodate them, because there are only so many units that can be used for that.",143,,
861,0.97,5959.253,5967.528,Council member--that's correct.,144,,
862,0.97,5967.528,5973.334,We can move folks on site to free up the Daycare unit if we have a need for someone coming back who wants to operate a Daycare.,144,,
863,0.97,5973.334,5978.339,We can deal with that so they don't have to go on a long list and wait three or four years to operate Adaycare.,144,,
864,0.97,5978.339,5980.174,"Thank you for your answers, I appreciate it.",145,,
865,0.97,5980.174,5984.478,Thank you as well.,146,,
866,0.97,5984.478,5986.146,I'm not seeing any additional questions on this.,146,,
867,0.97,5986.146,5990.451,"Okay, please go ahead.",146,,
868,0.97,5990.451,5995.856,"Thank you, chairman, thank you to the office of housing for resenting this great information.",147,,
869,0.97,5995.856,6004.665,"I just wanted to ask, sunset West in district six, I have the privilege of living next door to this apartment complex.",147,,
870,0.97,6004.665,6008.369,I just wanted to highlight its history.,147,,
871,0.97,6008.369,6034.728,"It was originally built by the air and space Machinists industrial local 751 as a retirement facility, and I'm just glad to see that it is being preserved to serve people who may not be able to afford thank you all, thank you for your hard work.",147,,
872,0.97,6034.728,6040.434,"Thank you, Councilmember.",148,,
873,0.97,6040.434,6052.312,"I have heard a desire to make sure that we have you back on the agenda here soon to get an update on Northgate, and perhaps, we can follow up on some strategic requisition.",148,,
874,0.97,6052.312,6057.051,"I will highlight that as well, does that sound okay?",148,,
875,0.97,6057.051,6057.451,Absolutely.,149,,
876,0.97,6057.451,6058.919,We are at your disposal.,149,,
877,0.97,6058.919,6061.388,We know we have the opportunity to work with you until July.,150,,
878,0.97,6061.388,6065.259,Is that right?,150,,
879,0.97,6065.259,6066.56,"Actually, it is until May.",151,,
880,0.97,6066.56,6068.495,I thought I would push it a little.,152,,
881,0.97,6068.495,6073.534,We have been trying.,153,,
882,0.97,6073.534,6079.239,"We will definitely get you back well before then, and we will have a chance to celebrate the amazing tenure you have had it sha.",154,,
883,0.97,6079.239,6087.748,"Thank you for that reminder, and early congratulations, but we are not ready to go yet.",154,,
884,0.97,6087.748,6088.849,You all have been tremendous.,154,,
885,0.97,6088.849,6091.485,"Thank you for your time this afternoon, and thank you for the presentation.",154,,
886,0.97,6091.485,6094.555,I don't see any more questions.,154,,
887,0.97,6094.555,6097.491,"Thank you, thank you.",155,,
888,0.97,6097.491,6102.596,"Okay, let's move on to the last item on the agenda, today.",156,,
889,0.97,6102.596,6109.169,"We have item number 16, if I'm not mistaken, Madam clerk, can you please read the last item into the record?",156,,
890,0.97,6109.169,6124.985,"Agenda item number 16, CB 119990, and ordinance relating to employment in Seattle establishing labor standards requirements for additional compensation for grocery employees working in Seattle, for discussion and possible vote.",157,,
891,0.97,6124.985,6126.22,"Excellent, thank you very much.",158,,
892,0.97,6126.22,6142.136,"We have with us the esteemed Karina bull, who spent and a tremendous amount of time working with--to understand what is going on in other jurisdictions as we understand the hazard pay in front of us.",158,,
893,0.97,6142.136,6152.412,"I appreciate your time, today.",158,,
894,0.97,6152.412,6156.783,I have asked our team to let your offices know that we are hoping to be done no later than 4:30.,158,,
895,0.97,6156.783,6158.018,That gives us about 45 minutes.,158,,
896,0.97,6158.018,6162.155,I know you have a presentation you will be walking us through along with the legislation in front of us.,158,,
897,0.97,6162.155,6174.468,I am thankful in advance for your time.,158,,
898,0.97,6174.468,6185.779,"Colleagues, I will keep my comments very brief, here, you have heard from workers who called in and spoke this morning, people leaning over them, reaching for Zucchini, they can feel their breath, they see the mask below their nose and mouth, and they are putting their lives at risk just to go to work.",158,,
899,0.97,6185.779,6189.449,"They don't have the opportunity to work from home like many of us on this call do, today.",158,,
900,0.97,6189.449,6203.597,"They are making sure we have food on the table and access to toilet paper and essentials and when we talk about workers being heroes or putting themselves out on the line being essential and sacrificing their health, we should not treat them as sacrificial.",158,,
901,0.97,6203.597,6205.599,We should compensate them for the hazard they are in.,158,,
902,0.97,6205.599,6206.667,That's what this is about.,158,,
903,0.97,6206.667,6229.59,"It's what the cities Los Angeles--the county of Los Angeles, Berkeley, Sacramento, and so many others are considering right now at this very moment, Santa Monica is coming up--Santa Monica has passed theirs as well.",158,,
904,0.97,6229.59,6231.024,Ellie is passing there's next week.,158,,
905,0.97,6231.024,6246.139,"Montebello is passing on the 27th, Oakland and San Jose, the first week of February, so like many cities up and down the West Coast, the skyrocketing cost of housing and goods and also skyrocketing cases of Covid, I'm excited to bring the legislation forward to you for consideration today and appreciate your the time--[Indiscernible].",158,,
906,0.97,6246.139,6250.644,Thank you.,159,,
907,0.97,6250.644,6255.582,[Indiscernible] I have a Powerpoint presentation.,159,,
908,0.97,6255.582,6260.52,There it is.,159,,
909,0.97,6260.52,6261.355,I am Karina Bull.,159,,
910,0.97,6261.355,6264.625,I am with Council Council central staff.,159,,
911,0.97,6264.625,6271.665,I've put together a presentation for the committee that includes an overview of the introduced legislation.,159,,
912,0.97,6271.665,6272.633,It was introduced on Tuesday.,159,,
913,0.97,6272.633,6278.372,"Along with a substitute bill, it makes it a small number of amendments as well.",159,,
914,0.97,6278.372,6307.601,"So, to begin, this legislation is emergency legislation, which means that there are a host of findings that show the need for emergency legislation that would have an immediately effective date due to the existence of the Covid-19 emergency, and the dire nature of the grocery workers who are on the front lines with the public performing their work.",159,,
915,0.97,6307.601,6323.95,"This legislation, at its heart, would require grocery businesses operating in Seattle to provide employees hazard pay at a rate of four dollars per hour for work performed in Seattle Uring the Covid-19 emergency.",159,,
916,0.97,6323.95,6338.765,"There are a number of provisions that could be given to those who already know our labor standards, and they will be going through each of these in these presentation.",159,,
917,0.97,6338.765,6360.954,"To begin, the employers that are covered by this proposed law would be grocery businesses, that is a term of the legislation, with 500 or more employees worldwide, and that 500 count would include employees in a franchise network, and it would include all the employees in what's called the integrated enterprise.",159,,
918,0.97,6360.954,6365.459,"If it's a subsidiary of a business, all the employees across the globe and the parent company will be counted.",159,,
919,0.97,6365.459,6373.834,"Covered employees will be those who are hourly, and covered by Seattle's ordinance.",159,,
920,0.97,6373.834,6384.711,"Karina, just on that last slide, I want to know, yes, we are recognizing the urgency of the Covid crisis, but we have also done Dude diligence to check in with other jurisdictions.",160,,
921,0.97,6384.711,6393.787,I asked the other jurisdictions.,160,,
922,0.97,6393.787,6395.288,We were defining the size.,160,,
923,0.97,6395.288,6402.095,"Some jurisdictions that I mentioned earlier, many of them are using 300 employees, we decided to go with a 500 number just in case you're wondering how it compares [Indiscernible].",160,,
924,0.97,6402.095,6419.312,"Yeah, the 500 number is consistent with ""city of Seattle's labor standards, secure scheduling, minimum wage, it also uses the 500 threshold, and it also counts employees across than franchise network as well.",161,,
925,0.97,6419.312,6428.889,"In the substitute bill, there is a proposed revision to employer coverage, actually, in the base jump for coverage, but I'm going to bring it up again when we talk about grocery businesses, so slight pause on this.",161,,
926,0.97,6428.889,6442.602,"Regarding employee coverage, the substitute bill produces a clarification that employees are covered if they work for a grocery business at a retail location.",161,,
927,0.97,6442.602,6454.848,"What that means, if the grocery business has a space that is purely comprised of administrative workers, purely Admin, those workers would not be covered.",161,,
928,0.97,6454.848,6471.431,"It is the workers at a retail location, and for those retail locations, it is everyone who is covered, even if there is a back room with a Bookkeeper, those workers still might meet in the break room, they might have the opportunity to Co- mingle with workers who are on the floor interacting with customers.",161,,
929,0.97,6471.431,6477.137,The proposals to cover all of them.,161,,
930,0.97,6477.137,6490.05,The definition of the grocery business is something that was adopted from the Los Angeles proposal for hazard pay.,162,,
931,0.97,6490.05,6492.085,It has been adopted to fit the needs of Seattle.,162,,
932,0.97,6492.085,6493.62,It would cover two kinds of businesses.,162,,
933,0.97,6493.62,6507.601,"One of them is over [Indiscernible] in size which is primarily engaged in the sale of groceries, and that would be the more classic kind of grocery store.",162,,
934,0.97,6507.601,6518.178,"Another one is over 85,000 square feet with 30% or more of its sales roughly dedicated to the sale of groceries.",162,,
935,0.97,6518.178,6524.451,"That is a kind of situation where it is a very large store that is engaged in selling general merchandise, some of which includes the sale of trees.",162,,
936,0.97,6524.451,6529.656,This would precisely pinpointed at 30% or more of sales Workspace.,162,,
937,0.97,6529.656,6540.5,"To clarify the types of businesses that are not covered, the legislation specifically says it does not include convenience stores or food marts.",162,,
938,0.97,6540.5,6547.841,That is to make it crystal clear both for outreach and enforcement and the general public to know what kinds of businesses are not covered.,162,,
939,0.97,6547.841,6557.551,"In the substitute bill, there is a proposed revision to also make it absolutely clear that farmers markets are not covered by this law as well.",162,,
940,0.97,6557.551,6559.719,They are outside.,162,,
941,0.97,6559.719,6569.529,"The square footage would not apply, necessarily, to those kinds of operations.",162,,
942,0.97,6569.529,6602.896,"Going back to an earlier proposed revision regarding employer coverage, when the office of labor standards is considering what kind of employer is covered, there may be some of the information, the definition is not immediately available, primarily engaged, whether it is 30% of floor space, this provision would allow Ols to take a number of factors into consideration to figure out if a business is covered.",162,,
943,0.97,6602.896,6618.078,"Docketing and promotion material, state representatives of the employer and other items, so this is a part of the law that seeks to help Ols make a--efficient determinations and be able to have a quicker investigation.",162,,
944,0.97,6618.078,6640.2,"So, moving on to the housing pay requirements, as I stated previously, it is four dollars for each hour worked in Seattle, the hazard pay is on top of the employees other compensation.",162,,
945,0.97,6640.2,6644.604,"What that means, if your employee is earning $20 an hour in wages, this hazard pay would be on top of that.",162,,
946,0.97,6644.604,6648.641,The employee would be earning $24 an hour for the period of time that this law is in effect.,162,,
947,0.97,6648.641,6655.348,The law does include a prohibition on reducing the employees compensation to meet these hazard pay requirements.,162,,
948,0.97,6655.348,6668.161,"What that means, is the employer would not be allowed to reduce the compensation from $20 to just the minimum wage at $16.69, then layer the four cents on top of that.",162,,
949,0.97,6668.161,6677.971,"Instead, this hazard pay is clearly to be paid on top of what employees are already earning.",162,,
950,0.97,6677.971,6682.008,"And, consistent with requirements that are already in law under the wage theft ordinance, there are notice requirements.",162,,
951,0.97,6682.008,6699.759,"Employers must provide a revised notice of employment, that is to the employee that they will be getting this hazard pay, typically, that kind of notice is required before the change in pay happens.",162,,
952,0.97,6699.759,6702.262,"In recognition that this is emergency legislation, it is going into effect, quickly.",162,,
953,0.97,6702.262,6707.0,The law does allow 30 days to provide that kind of information to employees.,162,,
954,0.97,6707.0,6714.007,"Also, the hazard pay needs to be provided on a regular pay day that wages are paid.",162,,
955,0.97,6714.007,6717.31,Hazard pay needs to be separately itemized on each paycheck.,162,,
956,0.97,6717.31,6720.513,"That way, and please know that they are getting it.",162,,
957,0.97,6720.513,6733.593,"One thing to mention, we know that some businesses have Aready been providing hazard pay.",162,,
958,0.97,6733.593,6752.078,"Whether it be at an increased rate per hour, two dollars per hour, the bonus, that might be four dollars per hour averaged out over a period of weeks, this particular hazard pay would be paid out, a Lump-Sum payment once a month would not comply with this ordinance.",162,,
959,0.97,6752.078,6763.423,"However, this next page, which is in the substitute bill, sorry, I'm going to move ahead.",162,,
960,0.97,6763.423,6776.236,"This recognizes that some employees, by the time this law goes into effect, may already be paying employees hazard pay, say they are already paying them two dollars an hour.",162,,
961,0.97,6776.236,6788.548,"The purpose of this law is not to augment employees pay six dollars, the existing two dollars plus another four dollars, this law is to make sure that employees get a sum total of four dollars per hour in hazard pay.",162,,
962,0.97,6788.548,6807.7,"In a proposed revision, there is what is called hazard pay offset, and what that would allow is an employer to count the additional compensation they are already providing towards the four dollar hazard pay obligation.",162,,
963,0.97,6807.7,6837.63,"There would need to be some things in place, in case it ever came to office of labor standards for a deeper look to make sure that employees are aware of why an employer may be increasing their pay by two dollars rather than four dollars, previous vacation to workers, this is additional compensation, this is being paid due to working the Covid- 19 emergency.",162,,
964,0.97,6837.63,6843.636,Employers would bear the burden of proof to show that the additional compensation was for the purposes of working during the Covid-19 emergency.,162,,
965,0.97,6843.636,6860.653,"At the end, when an employer may blend compensation with new compensation, the employer would need to make sure that all of the pay is being provided, on the employee's regular pay date, not some on the pay date and some once a month.",162,,
966,0.97,6860.653,6866.092,That is what these proposed revisions are seeking to accomplish.,162,,
967,0.97,6866.092,6893.553,"I will go back and say that another substitute bill revised provision is that lawyers are required to keep records of any reason for reduction in an employee's pay, so that will help establish the reduction in pay is due to a different reason than anything related to this law.",162,,
968,0.97,6893.553,6914.307,"Other requirements of the law include a standard display of the poster in the workplace, similar to the worker legislation that was passed last summer, the responsibility is on the employer to develop this notice of rights and put it in the workplace.",162,,
969,0.97,6914.307,6915.942,The employer has 30 days to do that.,162,,
970,0.97,6915.942,6945.204,"The Office of labor standards may develop a model poster, but it is ultimately the employer's responsibility for making that poster Record-Keeping is a standard with other labor standards, a three-year obligation to keep records, and of course, the retaliation is [Indiscernible] for workers exercising their rights.",162,,
971,0.97,6945.204,6951.144,"The Office of labor standards would be responsible for and Lamenting this law, that is policy development, outreach and enforcement, there is also a private right of action.",162,,
972,0.97,6951.144,6989.582,"Employees might be able to file a lawsuit, and remedies, again, similar to other labor standards, up to 3 times the amount owed, penalties paid to the city to the aggrieved party and finds--a couple of proposed revisions to the proposed section, the director is required to consider a range of actors when determining remedies which might help the direct or decide to not impose the full amount of the remedy that is owed, say the full amount of remedy is always paid to the worker, but there are penalties that can be up to $500 against the employer.",162,,
973,0.97,6989.582,6996.489,There are situations when the director decides not to levy the full $500 per worker penalty.,162,,
974,0.97,6996.489,7001.594,"Right now, the director is required to consider these fact errors.",162,,
975,0.97,7001.594,7012.939,This would give the discretion to consider those.,162,,
976,0.97,7020.046,7022.281,There is a penalty if they do not provide accurate records.,162,,
977,0.97,7022.281,7024.917,This revision would make it clear that that penalty is $50 per day.,162,,
978,0.97,7024.917,7026.119,"Again, that goes to the worker.",162,,
979,0.97,7026.119,7034.894,That penalty would only be in place when an employer is not providing sufficient records.,162,,
980,0.97,7034.894,7044.437,"The duration of the legislation, right now, employers would be required--I'm sorry, it says premium pay on there, but it should say hazard pay.",162,,
981,0.97,7044.437,7067.427,"Hazard pay for the duration of the Covid-19 emergency declared by the Mayor, the recitals make it very clear that the Council has considered modifying or eliminating this requirement after four or more months of implementation and recognition that after four months employees might be fully Vaccinated, and it might be appropriate for the Council to consider limiting those requirements.",162,,
982,0.97,7067.427,7085.745,"The legislation is set up right now that the hazard pay would continue throughout the duration of the emergency, even the fact that right now, it is a rapidly evolving situation, no one knows what is going to happen in four months.",162,,
983,0.97,7085.745,7089.582,"The foundation is, it continues throughout the emergency and Council may come back and decide to modify that.",162,,
984,0.97,7089.582,7093.052,The rest of the legislation is in place for 3 years after the emergency.,162,,
985,0.97,7093.052,7100.159,That gives allies the opportunity to look at those records and to enforce complaints of violation.,162,,
986,0.97,7100.159,7109.035,"So, the next steps, this may be up for a full council vote on Monday.",162,,
987,0.97,7109.035,7110.57,"Of course, the committee may take action, today.",162,,
988,0.97,7110.57,7124.917,I do want to add a few words about the office of labor standards because I have received questions about their capacity to take on a new law given their high workload.,162,,
989,0.97,7124.917,7145.738,"So I do want to give an overview of what is happening in the office of labor standards right now, and what they did to implement last summer's regulation for workers, that was premium pay for workers, it is sort of like the equivalent of hazard pay for workers who are delivering items for food delivery network companies and also paid sick tie for those workers.",162,,
990,0.97,7145.738,7159.785,"So, Ols did a tremendous amount of work to implement those laws.",162,,
991,0.97,7160.286,7163.322,"They didn't have to develop Faqs or rules, because the laws already addressed those issues.",162,,
992,0.97,7163.322,7184.076,"Similar for this law, Ols was a very close collaborator and provider of feedback, so this law reflects a lot of the items that usually would need to address, making Q and days if this law already addresses those issues, and if they had a chance to weigh in on the legislation, we really have appreciated their input and collaboration.",162,,
993,0.97,7184.076,7207.6,"Going back to last summer, Ols was able to create Faqs and web sheets in up to 10 languages, they had Webinars, they were able to have predetermined investigations for the pay legislation--they accomplished a great deal.",162,,
994,0.97,7207.6,7220.313,"They do not believe that this particular law--while similar to the [Indiscernible] legislation, is different that could result in work for them.",162,,
995,0.97,7220.313,7226.719,One of them is to have the occurrence that the fall covers employees and employers that are already covered by some of their other laws.,162,,
996,0.97,7226.719,7249.508,"So those folks--they are ready to ask and reach out to Ols for questions and assistance and that can create more work for them if there is an investigation that is opened up for this law then that might include investigation of those other laws as well that touched the employers, the wage theft minimum wage, secure scheduling, et cetera.",162,,
997,0.97,7249.508,7255.615,That is at the top of office of labor standards mind.,162,,
998,0.97,7255.615,7263.456,"They have indicated that they see the need for $10,000 for outreach, and about $112,000 to fill a pocket that was not funded for an outreach person.",162,,
999,0.97,7263.456,7264.624,This pocket is still there.,162,,
1000,0.97,7264.624,7268.361,It was not funded as the part of the last budget.,162,,
1001,0.97,7268.361,7283.976,That is something that the Council could consider as far as a supplement to budget or something that perhaps Ols could have on an emergency basis.,162,,
1002,0.97,7283.976,7287.213,"One last piece, Ols accomplished everything last summer in the midst of a hiring freeze.",162,,
1003,0.97,7287.213,7290.983,They were short staffed and couldn't hire folks.,162,,
1004,0.97,7290.983,7294.754,"At this moment, they hired two investigators, they have seven vacant positions, that's a quarter of their office.",162,,
1005,0.97,7294.754,7298.391,They are budgeted for Ftes.,162,,
1006,0.97,7298.391,7300.993,They are in the process of hiring for 4 of those positions.,162,,
1007,0.97,7300.993,7328.487,"There are job announcements for the two positions that were opened in the 2021 budget as Oon as the hr paperwork is done, and they are waiting on next steps for the vacant outreach manager position when the new director comes on board, which is the last thing I will say, of course, Ols has nominated directors that will come on board in the weekend of February and [Indiscernible] process.",162,,
1008,0.97,7328.487,7329.922,That is my presentation for this legislation.,162,,
1009,0.97,7329.922,7331.29,I welcome any questions.,162,,
1010,0.97,7331.29,7335.728,Thank you so much.,163,,
1011,0.97,7335.728,7345.337,I see Councilmember Herbold.,163,,
1012,0.97,7345.337,7355.848,You have done a great job walking us through the supplemental bill as well as the underlying bill.,163,,
1013,0.97,7355.848,7357.45,Thank you for your research and your time.,163,,
1014,0.97,7357.45,7366.926,"I also want to thank my chief of staff who has been doing tremendous amount of outreach and engagement on this issue, and really knows the issue in and out in the urgency, really stepping in after the holidays to help make this possible, this week.",163,,
1015,0.97,7366.926,7378.037,I also want to thank [Indiscernible]. You heard public testimony with the groceries.,163,,
1016,0.97,7378.037,7379.038,We had a few conversations.,163,,
1017,0.97,7379.038,7383.576,"I always try to reach out and get feedback on items, even if there is disagreement, the feedback has been very helpful.",163,,
1018,0.97,7383.576,7388.748,It has helped inform many of the changes you see in the supplemental bill in front of us.,163,,
1019,0.97,7388.748,7396.989,We really appreciate the groceries time on this and letting us know some things that are more workable or some concerns that came up so we can find some solutions.,163,,
1020,0.97,7396.989,7422.615,"Of course, the folks at UFC W 21, Samantha, doing outreach to jurisdictions doing similar legislation, we will reiterate in just a few minutes, I just want to say thank you for all of your work and I will turn it over to Vice-Chair Herbold for her question I believe on the last question related to Ols.",163,,
1021,0.97,7422.615,7424.517,"Yeah, I have a suggestion at a question.",164,,
1022,0.97,7424.517,7436.929,The suggestion as it relates to funding is whether or not we could investigate Federal reimbursement associated with Covid response.,164,,
1023,0.97,7436.929,7474.567,"I'm hearing that potentially the city might want to think about being more creative in some of our requests to the Federal Government, for instance, King County has done a reimbursement under Covid for the work that they have been doing around hate crimes, because there has been an increase in hate crimes during the time of Covid, Similarly, this is not legislation we would need anyone to enforce, but for the Presidents--presence of Covid.",164,,
1024,0.97,7474.567,7481.64,"Just filling that out, that might be something worth checking with the budget offices they manage, the things that they are requesting reimbursement for for the Federal Government.",164,,
1025,0.97,7481.64,7500.092,"My question goes back to the definition--excuse me, a grocery store, for purposes of application of this law, I ask because I know I will be asked.",164,,
1026,0.97,7500.092,7502.394,"I will be asked, why are we just using the code?",164,,
1027,0.97,7502.394,7522.748,"The definition seems really complicated, so, I want to be able to answer folks who asked why we are not simply relying on the [Indiscernible].",164,,
1028,0.97,7524.183,7524.717,Thank you.,164,,
1029,0.97,7524.717,7526.085,We had this discussion as well.,165,,
1030,0.97,7526.085,7527.853,I know you have good answers on that.,165,,
1031,0.97,7527.853,7546.338,"Thank you for the suggestion on the Federal funds, especially for Covid relief, this is very much in line with some of the other conversations that we have had with the director of budget, and we would very much like to take that up as we think about ways to help provide some immediate relief to our friends and fellows thank you for that [Indiscernible], thank you.",165,,
1032,0.97,7546.338,7565.658,"There were a range of things considered, the mix code, the landings code, what was actually landed on, and the mix code can be helpful, it can also be a bit confusing, because employers choose their code, then they use that for their business license.",166,,
1033,0.97,7565.658,7568.16,Sometimes they choose a code that isn't actually appropriate for their business.,166,,
1034,0.97,7568.16,7579.038,"For example, when I looked at the codes at Qfc, it was listed as a general merchandise--[Indiscernible] rather than a supermarket, in other words, [Indiscernible] supermarket.",166,,
1035,0.97,7579.038,7596.422,"I found that many convenience stores chose to classify themselves by the code for Supermarkets rather than convenience stores, when there is actually a code for convenience stores.",166,,
1036,0.97,7596.422,7627.152,"So that can get confusing both for businesses and for the offices of labor standards when they are trying to do enforcement, if they have to rely solely on the code--if they have grappled with that and the limitation of secure schedule and ordinance which is actually easier because it is broader but still for this legislation we are just more narrowly focused on particular employers that are primarily engaged in groceries or that do it as part of their larger general merchandise sale of items.",166,,
1037,0.97,7627.152,7640.933,It was determined to go ahead and base it on this by brocaded definition that testing wishes between primarily Supermarkets and general merchandise which has 30% of the sales force space and groceries.,166,,
1038,0.97,7640.933,7641.533,Does that help?,166,,
1039,0.97,7641.533,7646.238,Thank you.,167,,
1040,0.97,7646.238,7654.947,"Excellent, thank you, great question, and I know we will be asked, so great, thank you for allowing us to have the benefit of that answer.",168,,
1041,0.97,7654.947,7663.555,Are there any additional questions on the presentation from Karina?,168,,
1042,0.97,7663.555,7664.223,President Gonzales?,168,,
1043,0.97,7664.223,7664.857,Please go ahead.,168,,
1044,0.97,7664.857,7665.658,"Thank you, Madam chair.",169,,
1045,0.97,7665.658,7674.466,"Thank you Karina, for the good work on this, as always, very thorough.",169,,
1046,0.97,7674.466,7681.44,"I just wanted to make--on the Covid Federal reimbursement potential, I just wanted to remind folks that we will actually have our Federal lobbyist with us on Friday during the Council briefing.",169,,
1047,0.97,7681.44,7682.441,Put a pin in that.,169,,
1048,0.97,7682.441,7688.147,Let's bring that up on Monday to make sure we signal that interest to our Federal lobbying team.,169,,
1049,0.97,7688.147,7688.981,It's a great suggestion.,169,,
1050,0.97,7688.981,7737.362,"Karina, really quickly, on the issue of deduction, so there was a slide you went through where you laid out that you cannot come out of compensation for employees, the first thing I thought of, are we going to see employers do a deduction on employees page tax--which, you know, can Arguably be considered not taken away from compensation, because it is not part of the hourly wage, it is something else, it's a difference in other deduction.",169,,
1051,0.97,7737.362,7743.535,"Then he went on in your presentation, you had a different slide that talked about deductions, they have to be reported and documented.",169,,
1052,0.97,7743.535,7762.821,So I am not quite clear if the legislation explicitly prohibits deductions for purposes of accounting for the requirements that pay for hazard pay.,169,,
1053,0.97,7762.821,7773.732,Does the legislation explicitly prohibits an employer who this law would apply to?,169,,
1054,0.97,7773.732,7790.883,"Does it explicitly prohibit the employer from imposing a deduction on an employee's paycheck for purposes of, you know, making up the difference on the hazard pay?",169,,
1055,0.97,7790.883,7793.452,That's a great question.,170,,
1056,0.97,7793.452,7811.203,"My memory of state [Indiscernible] law on deductions is recalling that for an employer to take money out of an employee's pay, there needs to be an agreement from the employee to do that.",170,,
1057,0.97,7811.203,7815.774,It cannot be something that the employer unilaterally does.,170,,
1058,0.97,7815.774,7817.709,"So, that is the first part of my answer.",170,,
1059,0.97,7817.709,7826.985,"The next part is, [Indiscernible], I believe the legislation covers this.",170,,
1060,0.97,7826.985,7829.688,It has a very broadly worded statement.,170,,
1061,0.97,7829.688,7835.894,This is on slide 10 of the presentation.,170,,
1062,0.97,7835.894,7853.545,[Indiscernible] employers as a result of this ordinance shall not take steps to reduce employee compensation so as to prevent them from receiving the hazard pay at a rate of four Dllars per hour.,170,,
1063,0.97,7853.545,7862.12,"And so, any deduction from compensation is a step to reduce the compensation.",170,,
1064,0.97,7862.12,7881.773,I would think that kind of action would fall into prohibition against employers who are taking any kind of step to reduce the compensation to not reflect the full four dollars an hour hazard pay.,170,,
1065,0.97,7881.773,7882.841,Do you have a question?,171,,
1066,0.97,7882.841,7885.544,Not really.,172,,
1067,0.97,7885.544,7910.102,"I'm still concerned that--and part of it is because I don't have the actual definition of compensation in front of me, what I'm worried about is that--I need to get a clear understanding of what compensation is in this ordinance.",172,,
1068,0.97,7910.102,7960.385,"Because I think there's an argument that could be made depending on what the definition of composition is, that would be sort of narrowly scoped to the hourly wage . So, in other words, if compensation is defined as $15 per hour, but I am basically saying I'm going to deduct four dollars from your paycheck for other reasons, does that actually mean that that employer is Impacting compensation, or would it be considered in a different Non-Compensation category for which an employer can justify the deduction?",172,,
1069,0.97,7960.385,7965.257,Does that make sense?,172,,
1070,0.97,7965.257,7969.161,I am a little concerned that there might be some vagueness in there.,172,,
1071,0.97,7969.161,7972.965,"Maybe there isn't, we probably defined what compensation means.",172,,
1072,0.97,7972.965,7974.166,But I would like that clarity.,172,,
1073,0.97,7974.166,7995.153,"What I don't want is to have, you know, vagueness around that deduction component, seeing employers reducing paychecks in a different way under a different deductions category.",172,,
1074,0.97,7995.153,8007.132,"Yes, the first thing I will say, I will follow up with you off-line to make sure that these concerns are addressed.",173,,
1075,0.97,8007.132,8012.204,"And then, I will also say that compensation is defined in this ordinance the same way it is defined in the wage theft ordinance.",173,,
1076,0.97,8012.204,8013.005,"Again, it is quite broad.",173,,
1077,0.97,8013.005,8021.513,It means the payment owed to an employment for reasons of employment.,173,,
1078,0.97,8021.513,8038.864,"Any payment that is due by virtue of being an employee, whether it be wages, tips, service charge distributions, overtime, rest breaks, promised Legislatively, required pay or pay leave, it could be reimbursement for employment or employer expenses, all of that is in the definition of compensation.",173,,
1079,0.97,8038.864,8042.934,So I'm feeling confident it addresses the situation you said.,173,,
1080,0.97,8042.934,8049.341,"Again, I will follow-up to confirm that and get back in touch with you.",173,,
1081,0.97,8049.341,8050.142,"Awesome, thanks, Karina.",174,,
1082,0.97,8050.142,8050.942,I appreciate that.,174,,
1083,0.97,8050.942,8120.178,"I just want to make sure we are clear on what can be deducted from the final page and what cannot be under this hazard pay legislation because it is the Council's intent to make sure that that does not--that a deduction framework is not used as a vehicle to circumvent the compensation components and restrictions of the bill as proposed by the chair so if you could just confirm that for me, that would be great, and if we can't confirm it, and we sort of realize that there might be a little bit of cleanup needed, I would certainly be interested in working with the chair in advancing some technical clarification to make sure that the deduction component is not going to be able to be utilized in a way that would be contrary to the intent of the legislation, thank you manager.",174,,
1084,0.97,8120.178,8121.546,"Thank you very much, Council President.",175,,
1085,0.97,8121.546,8122.247,I appreciate the questions.,175,,
1086,0.97,8122.247,8130.288,"I know we want to ensure that every eye is dotted and every t is crossed, so thank you for following up on that.",175,,
1087,0.97,8130.288,8147.973,I also share a similar level of confidence in having feedback from some of the folks who have received this from the worker--sort of advocate side in ensuring that the language was clear.,175,,
1088,0.97,8147.973,8164.623,"The thing that was most important in the response that we received was that there is a fair representative being kept, something we wanted to make sure of.",175,,
1089,0.97,8164.623,8174.166,"I think there are similar Crossovers in the desire of the outcome of the legislation and the intent of being Replicated on this and I believe I hear the Council President saying if there's any questions by Monday, we would potentially work on some technical cleanup.",175,,
1090,0.97,8174.166,8179.738,"Yeah, and I think the sort of Record-Keeping pieces are really important.",176,,
1091,0.97,8179.738,8218.977,"But if the law is at all ambiguous about how deductions can or cannot be utilized in the context of hazard pay, then I am nervous that we will have Record-Keeping on deductions, but not away to sort of do course correction in the event we are seeing employers utilizing the deduction aspects on a final paycheck to circumvent the intent of the law.",176,,
1092,0.97,8218.977,8227.252,"It sounds like we have addressed that in the bill, and that is not a concern, and I am appreciative of Karina saying that, and I'm looking forward to Karina confirming that Off- line.",176,,
1093,0.97,8227.252,8238.029,"Once we have a little bit more time, just to make sure of that, that is triple quadruple confirmed.",176,,
1094,0.97,8238.029,8238.964,"Excellent, I appreciate that.",177,,
1095,0.97,8238.964,8241.433,"And thank you, Karina, as well, for your answering us here, today.",177,,
1096,0.97,8241.433,8250.875,"Also, we will follow up with our colleagues to make sure that that answer is reflected in the record for our discussion.",177,,
1097,0.97,8250.875,8254.846,"Is there any other questions, are there any comments?",177,,
1098,0.97,8254.846,8259.818,"Madam chair, [Indiscernible].",178,,
1099,0.97,8259.818,8262.554,"Go ahead, Councilmember Lewis.",179,,
1100,0.97,8262.554,8264.456,I have a brief comment.,180,,
1101,0.97,8264.456,8314.906,"I appreciate Katrina's presentation, some of the Rulemaking and some of the Backend administrative stuff at possibly reduced standards that was done for the gig--the App based gig worker that Councilmember Herbold and I proposed last year, is implement in this, which is good to hear, you know, I was proud to put that forward and proud to support this legislation, I would just--the only other comment I would make at this time, I will reserve my comments for Monday, is I would Express, given my past support, the gig worker has your pay legislation.",180,,

I would like to express my interest at this time to be added as a cosponsor to this legislation and really thank you for bringing this forward and the coalition that has been assembled in support of this and I am proud to support it today and on Monday.",180,,
