16,0.97,38.872,39.272,Eight present.,16,,
17,0.97,39.272,40.273,Thank you so much.,17,,
18,0.97,40.273,46.112,"If there's no objection, the minutes of June 8th, 2020 will be adopted.",17,,
19,0.97,46.112,50.016,"Hearing no objection, the minutes are adopted.",17,,
20,0.97,50.016,50.45,President's report.,17,,
21,0.97,50.45,53.052,I'll do this really quickly because I know we have a full agenda.,17,,
22,0.97,53.052,71.037,"I want to let folks know that you should be expecting in your in boxes an update from me about Telework protocols for the remainder of the year, and I'm looking forward to sharing that information with you.",17,,
23,0.97,71.037,115.048,"We have gone through the process of asking each of our division directors to engage with their staff around what they hope to see in terms of our work model moving forward, and so looking forward to getting out a memo to all of you that reflects what I think will be a policy that really does enter the health and safety of our workers and all of our workforce, and makes sure that we are still continuing to follow public health policies, particularly around the CDC's recommendations of office work or an In-Office work option.",17,,
24,0.97,115.048,132.765,"So be aware there will be a directive, the directive will indicate that in the interest of the ongoing public health of our employees, we will continue to Telecommute through the end of this year, and all of our committee and Council meetings will continue to be held remotely as well.",17,,
25,0.97,132.765,161.794,"That is, again, consistent with a lot of information that we are seeing coming out of public health officials and agencies that really talk about how if you can do Telework, you should continue to have Telework models in your office space, and so we are continuing to make sure that our policies here are centered on those issues you may have seen that the Mayor's office issued a directive to her executive agencies extending the Telework policy until September.",17,,
26,0.97,161.794,200.967,"I think it's prudent for us to extend it through the end of the year, including having remote Council meetings and Committee meetings and working closely still with FAS and Monica in our clerk's office to provide an In-Person viewing option so that we can continue to comply with the open public meetings should the proclamation that applies to the open public meetings act is not--if it's not extended, then we will have hopefully a safe alternative for folks to do In-Person viewing that allows us to continue to meet remotely.",17,,
27,0.97,200.967,204.737,Happy to take any questions or comments on that.,17,,
28,0.97,204.737,211.778,Also happy to connect with you all after you see the memo and have a little bit more granular detail around those policies.,17,,
29,0.97,211.778,218.952,"Any questions or comments, colleagues?",17,,
30,0.97,218.952,219.218,Great.,17,,
31,0.97,219.218,223.99,"Move onto agenda item 3, which is a presentation on Council bill.",17,,
32,0.97,223.99,232.131,This is related to an acceptance of a property transfer for the purposes of development of multiple housing.,17,,
33,0.97,232.131,237.17,Always excited to see development of affordable housing on our agenda.,17,,
34,0.97,237.17,238.538,We have until 9:50 A.M.,17,,
35,0.97,238.538,242.976,To have both the briefing and discussion on this issue.,17,,
36,0.97,242.976,255.254,"We have several Presenters, Emily Alvarado, also have Steve Shain from the office of housing.",17,,
37,0.97,255.254,258.758,Tracy also available on the line.,17,,
38,0.97,258.758,263.363,"Councilmember Mosqueda, did you have introductory remarks on this item as the chair of the committee responsible for housing?",17,,
39,0.97,263.363,268.067,"And if so, I will happy to yield the floor to you.",17,,
40,0.97,268.067,268.501,Very briefly.,18,,
41,0.97,268.501,268.835,Thank you.,18,,
42,0.97,268.835,275.108,I want to thank all the folks who are lined up to present today and for your office's Facilitation to get them there.,18,,
43,0.97,275.108,287.387,This is a really exciting opportunity and I know that many people are interested in taking advantage of any property that we can to help affordable housing because we reduced the cost of overall housing.,18,,
44,0.97,287.387,301.901,"This has been a partnership with the state Legislature so looking forward to hearing any of the conversation and then with the Council's support, moving as quickly as we can to get these housing units built as we transfer the property, as this first step.",18,,
45,0.97,301.901,303.236,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda.,19,,
46,0.97,303.236,305.338,Who is going to kick us off first?,19,,
47,0.97,305.338,308.941,"Is it going to be office of housing, or Tracy, you want to go first?",19,,
48,0.97,308.941,315.815,We are going to go to Steven Shain and to Emily Alvarado for the presentation.,20,,
49,0.97,315.815,316.182,Excellent.,21,,
50,0.97,316.182,317.116,Take it away.,21,,
51,0.97,317.116,317.75,Sorry for logistics.,22,,
52,0.97,317.75,322.522,Do I need to share something or there is a Powerpoint presentation?,22,,
53,0.97,322.522,323.389,How does that work?,22,,
54,0.97,323.389,327.36,It's usually Whoever is presenting usually shares their screen so --,23,,
55,0.97,327.36,332.098,I can do that.,24,,
56,0.97,332.098,337.67,If you give me one second.,24,,
57,0.97,337.67,338.137,Sorry.,24,,
58,0.97,338.137,338.371,No.,25,,
59,0.97,338.371,338.638,That's okay.,25,,
60,0.97,342.108,348.414,The host has disabled my screen sharing.,26,,
61,0.97,348.414,348.648,I.T.,27,,
62,0.97,348.648,353.72,Can work on that and give you permission to share.,27,,
63,0.97,353.72,354.22,Council President.,28,,
64,0.97,354.22,354.487,Yes.,29,,
65,0.97,354.487,358.891,"Since we have a moment, maybe I can add a little context as we wait for that to get shared.",30,,
66,0.97,358.891,364.263,"It looks like she now has the authority to share, so all right.",31,,
67,0.97,364.263,364.597,There we go.,31,,
68,0.97,364.597,370.703,"I appreciate the offer to filibuster, Councilmember Mosqueda.",31,,
69,0.97,370.703,373.773,You're welcome.,32,,
70,0.97,373.773,374.407,Okay.,33,,
71,0.97,374.407,380.446,And I will--I'm trying to move this.,33,,
72,0.97,380.446,388.621,"So the--thank you, Councilmembers for the opportunity to present today.",33,,
73,0.97,388.621,405.071,"As we--as was mentioned, this is really legislation, straightforward legislation to accept property known as the University of Washington laundry site, which is in the mt . Baker neighborhood.",33,,
74,0.97,405.071,412.545,And previously this site was owned--was used by the University of Washington as Consolidated laundry services.,33,,
75,0.97,412.545,443.376,"And as you may recall and as mentioned by Councilmember Mosqueda in the 2019 state Capitol budget, the state Legislature directed the property to be taken from the University of Washington and transferred to the city of Seattle and there was a hard transfer date of June 30th, 2020.",33,,
76,0.97,443.376,455.054,"And the site will be used per the city--the Capitol budget proviso for affordable housing and other kinds of benefits, like research and clinical uses including early learning.",33,,
77,0.97,455.054,464.897,"So this is an exciting opportunity, but today is just the first step in Availing that opportunity by accepting the property.",33,,
78,0.97,464.897,474.207,Because the city charter requires Council action and legislation in order to accept property.,33,,
79,0.97,476.442,479.245,"Councilmembers, good morning, this is Steven Shain.",34,,
80,0.97,479.245,487.186,Just wanted to identify that this is a substantial piece of property in the mt . Baker area.,34,,
81,0.97,487.186,494.527,A little shy of four acres and as has been mentioned it's really to develop affordable housing ground floor early learning and open space.,34,,
82,0.97,494.527,517.517,"As you can see there's a little piece of property that sits up on the North here that says--that's a little piece that sits underneath the mt . Baker light rail that has limited heights capacity, but all the property the University of Washington owns in mt . Baker is going to be transferred to the city of Seattle.",34,,
83,0.97,517.517,523.656,"The laundry site, Kings hall and then there's a parking lot on the bottom.",34,,
84,0.97,523.656,540.139,"One of the things that--this is a fairly, if you will--at no cost to the city, that authorizes O.H.",34,,
85,0.97,540.139,554.854,"To--under the property owner, their jurisdiction and FAS will go ahead and manage the property with a limited cause from office--a couple of key issues to consider on the property.",34,,
86,0.97,554.854,560.493,"The legislature said that the city would take the property with all liabilities, will transfer the property.",34,,
87,0.97,560.493,572.572,"We went ahead and did substantial due diligence prior to accepting--before we accepted the property, we did an environmental phase one and phase two.",34,,
88,0.97,572.572,573.139,There is limited exposure.,34,,
89,0.97,573.139,576.976,"Just want to make it clear, it was a laundry site, not a Dry- cleaner.",34,,
90,0.97,576.976,584.05,"A lot of people assume that because it was a laundry, there's Groundwater contamination from that.",34,,
91,0.97,584.05,591.857,There is some soil contamination that our environmental engineer has suggested through a soil management plan that that can be taken care of.,34,,
92,0.97,591.857,614.714,"One of the other items that we negotiated with the University of Washington and it's an up front reversionary interest that provides the University that the city has ten years to go ahead and develop the property and within that Ten- year period of time if we don't, those portions that could be--revert back to the University of Washington.",34,,
93,0.97,614.714,619.218,Parcel C on the North is not subject to that reversionary interest.,34,,
94,0.97,619.218,628.928,The other part of the reversionary interest is once we get 200 units in construction all the reversionary interest burns off.,34,,
95,0.97,628.928,648.514,So one additional piece that is not included in this legislation is to let you know that the capital budget proviso doesn't address all the details of the property transfer and therefore we have established a term sheet that will be executed between me and the University of Washington.,35,,
96,0.97,648.514,649.849,It's a nonbinding agreement.,35,,
97,0.97,649.849,656.255,"It spells out our intent, but it does cover a few issues that I wanted to share with you all.",35,,
98,0.97,656.255,669.268,"One is it puts forward that the Úoffice of housing will go Ahea and release our first Rfq related to potentially a phased redevelopment of the site by June 30th, 2021.",35,,
99,0.97,669.268,689.655,"Also, because it allows for the opportunity for the University of Washington to participate in the site, namely, on the ground floor spaces, the term sheet helps spell out specific deadlines that would need to be able to be met by the university to meet that--to meet our Rfq deadline.",35,,
100,0.97,689.655,701.133,"In addition, the capital budget proviso explicitly States that units on the site shall count towards the University of Washington's master plan obligation for affordable housing.",35,,
101,0.97,701.133,709.675,"The term sheet also carries forward that capital budget language, but saying that only units that are actually constructed will count.",35,,
102,0.97,709.675,725.491,"And it's important to know that in order to count, the University of Washington will be reporting progress on their obligations as part of their annual reporting to Sdci.",35,,
103,0.97,725.491,727.393,So that's generally what the term sheet includes.,35,,
104,0.97,727.393,736.035,That has been executed by the University of Washington and pending my signature.,35,,
105,0.97,736.035,741.34,"So the next steps on this site, you see we were optimistic there, apologies for the error.",35,,
106,0.97,741.34,749.749,"We are discussing this with you today on June 15th, in anticipation of a full council vote.",35,,
107,0.97,749.749,762.461,"The most important thing to notice on this Timeline is that June 30th, 2020, is the date by which the capital budget directs transfer of this property.",35,,
108,0.97,762.461,768.868,So our action is--and your action is in anticipation of what the capital budget says will need to happen.,35,,
109,0.97,768.868,787.853,"And then we will be moving forward subject to more community engagement, collaboration and collective Visioning around how we release an Rfq for the first phase of redevelopment for affordable housing and other public benefits.",35,,
110,0.97,787.853,792.491,And I'll stop there.,35,,
111,0.97,792.491,793.192,"Thank you, Emily.",36,,
112,0.97,793.192,811.71,"Colleagues, we may be having a little bit of a technology issue, and I.T., I'm going to ask that you all give us a sense of what we need to do next, if zoom is giving us a warning that we only have three minutes left.",36,,
113,0.97,811.71,813.546,The issue should resolve shortly here.,37,,
114,0.97,813.546,817.483,"If it doesn't, we will reconvene right away.",37,,
115,0.97,817.483,820.286,Usually this gets a little too close--Yeah.,37,,
116,0.97,820.286,827.993,"So if--so this meeting abruptly ends, then Councilmembers and Presenters will need to call back in.",38,,
117,0.97,827.993,829.562,Is that what I'm hearing you say?,38,,
118,0.97,829.562,829.995,"Yes, thank you.",39,,
119,0.97,829.995,846.111,"We will go ahead and go as long as we can, hope that--I feel like we are in our very own episode of 24 hours now, and so we will hopefully not see an expiration of the time here and that will get resolved.",40,,
120,0.97,846.111,850.783,"Tracy, anything to add before I open this up for questions?",40,,
121,0.97,850.783,851.283,Nope.,41,,
122,0.97,851.283,854.987,"Have reviewed the legislation, reviewed the phase one, phase two environmental.",41,,
123,0.97,854.987,862.261,Talked to law as far as we are concerned the legislation is ready to move forward.,41,,
124,0.97,862.261,863.395,Okay.,42,,
125,0.97,863.395,864.73,Anything to add?,42,,
126,0.97,864.73,879.278,"Only that master plans requirement for 450 affordable housing units, 150 of which are 60% of AMI, area to median income.",43,,
127,0.97,879.278,880.012,I'm sorry.,44,,
128,0.97,880.012,886.085,Only 150 are below--are 60% or less area median income?,44,,
129,0.97,886.085,886.719,Yes.,45,,
130,0.97,886.719,892.791,And the remainder are 80% or below area median income.,45,,
131,0.97,892.791,893.192,Got it.,46,,
132,0.97,893.192,895.261,That was going to be my next question.,46,,
133,0.97,895.261,909.074,I didn't see this in the presentation and it could be that I was worried about the time keeper here.,46,,
134,0.97,909.074,914.179,"How many have family sized units versus one bedrooms, et cetera?",46,,
135,0.97,914.179,917.016,For the Redevelopment or under the master plan?,47,,
136,0.97,917.016,922.454,"For the redevelopment, I will say we are not there yet.",47,,
137,0.97,922.454,943.509,"What the capital budget proviso says and what we have said as part of the term sheet is we are going to Redevelop the site with an eye--from our perspective at the office of housing, that means we typically do a mix of units to accommodate families and single individual working people.",47,,
138,0.97,943.509,952.351,So we look forward to identifying that mix as part of the Redevelopment Rfq and welcome your input and feedback as we do so.,47,,
139,0.97,952.351,952.618,Great.,48,,
140,0.97,952.618,967.933,"And then in terms of how we would provide feedback, what's the structure for that, for Council to be able to have our priorities reflected in terms of that redevelopment plan?",48,,
141,0.97,967.933,971.403,I welcome your thoughts on how we can collaborate.,49,,
142,0.97,971.403,983.182,"Certainly one thing we are able to do as we have done on other publicly owned sites, including some homeownership sites, is we have brought to Council a proposal for the Rfq and I would be happy to do that in this case.",49,,
143,0.97,983.182,989.822,It's a significant piece of property and I know it's really important to the city as T.O.D.,49,,
144,0.97,989.822,992.658,And to the community.,49,,
145,0.97,992.658,992.925,Great.,50,,
146,0.97,992.925,993.325,"Okay, colleagues.",50,,
147,0.97,993.325,1000.132,I am happy to open this up for questions and comments.,50,,
148,0.97,1000.132,1020.819,"Councilmember Morales already indicated to me early on she has some comments and questions, perhaps some questions that she would like to make in this phase so if for any of you who are interested in also making some comments or for those of you who have questions for Council central staff or office of housing staff, now is the time to do that.",50,,
149,0.97,1020.819,1034.266,So I am--[no Audio],50,,
150,0.97,1199.765,1212.077,"I want to be clear that as this project develops, we need to Steward our city resources and make sure we are addressing the need for good jobs as this projects develops, particularly for communities of color.",51,,
151,0.97,1212.077,1226.992,I also want to point out that this parcel is a block away from the mt . Baker light rail station and a block away from the intersection of Mlk and Rainier Avenue.,51,,
152,0.97,1226.992,1234.666,"So a lot of community planning already in that neighborhood for the last five years, people looking for safer space.",51,,
153,0.97,1234.666,1246.478,Franklin high school is there and so the students need that area to be more accessible and a safer place for them to back and forth.,51,,
154,0.97,1246.478,1257.99,"There's conversation happening about moving the Metro bus Depot, so that there is less pedestrian traffic as people try to get around the neighborhood.",51,,
155,0.97,1257.99,1271.637,"So I just want to let Councilmembers know that once this project transfers and especially once the laundry facility and the Kings hall are demolished, it's going to leave a huge hole in the neighborhood.",51,,
156,0.97,1271.637,1289.621,"If we are talking about ten years potentially before anything develops there, we just need to make sure that this is really thoughtful and really intentional in not leaving a giant hole in the Gateway into the Rainier valley.",51,,
157,0.97,1289.621,1327.159,"You know, I was talking to a constituent yesterday who said this is a rare opportunity, seven acres altogether of Developable land, really close to downtown, so we need to make sure that everything we do here is very intentional about protecting the community, centering what they want to see in these projects, and making sure that this is also centering equity as we move forward with this project.",51,,
158,0.97,1327.159,1339.137,"So director, you and I have--the interest of the community are reflected from the very beginning in the kind of developer that is sought as this project begins.",51,,
159,0.97,1339.137,1348.48,So I look forward to being in very close contact with you as this continues.,51,,
160,0.97,1348.48,1349.214,Thank you.,51,,
161,0.97,1349.214,1349.581,Absolutely.,52,,
162,0.97,1349.581,1353.251,"I look forward to the collaboration, sorry, Council President.",52,,
163,0.97,1353.251,1366.898,"I will say one thing, our hope is there is development on this site before ten years, just to point out that the ten years is really related to a reversionary interest that the University would get in the event that no progress is made.",52,,
164,0.97,1366.898,1381.58,But we do intend to move forward next year with an Rfq and hopefully we can make some meaningful impact on this site that's consistent with community vision for before then.,52,,
165,0.97,1381.58,1387.285,I think I appreciate that clarification and that sort of threading of the needle there.,53,,
166,0.97,1387.285,1406.772,I think we have seen in the past that sometimes the city has good intentions around development and moving forward with development and then one thing happens and then another thing happens and another thing happens and the next thing we know we are in year ten and still haven't developed things and that's not a criticism of the office of housing.,53,,
167,0.97,1406.772,1415.113,That's more of a criticism of the full Ecosystem in which we as a city--[no Audio],53,,
168,0.97,1431.897,1453.919,"That this is going to advance and making sure there's contingency planning in the event that something falls through, we want to have good contingency planning to make sure that we can sort of Pivot in an opportunity that is presented by this potential project.",54,,
169,0.97,1453.919,1457.989,I think I saw Councilmember Sawant's hand go up.,54,,
170,0.97,1457.989,1463.595,"Any other folks who have questions or comments, please make sure to raise your hand.",54,,
171,0.97,1463.595,1464.496,Councilmember--[no Audio],54,,
172,0.97,1465.53,1472.404,Should I go ahead?,55,,
173,0.97,1472.404,1473.205,"Yes, please.",56,,
174,0.97,1473.205,1475.54,Thank you.,56,,
175,0.97,1475.54,1483.481,"So Needless to say, of course strongly supports bilingual city housing.",56,,
176,0.97,1483.481,1490.589,I wanted to--the context of how this came about or is coming back.,56,,
177,0.97,1490.589,1492.123,I understand these are the first steps.,56,,
178,0.97,1492.123,1507.739,It's a real shame that the University of Washington closed the laundry despite workers and their unions saying it was not the right kind of step because it has ended up laying some of our most marginalized workers off.,56,,
179,0.97,1507.739,1564.329,"They were already not being paid enough for their labor but at the same time many of the employees were immigrant and--from immigrant communities and many of them were women and so while absolutely we would welcome and celebrate affordable housing, it is also a reminder that we don't want a situation where something that is socially beneficial is taken away and then something else that's socially beneficial would in place we want both, we want the jobs, public sector, unionized jobs and we want affordable housing and the only way we can accomplish that is in addition to projects like this, to have a major expansion of Progressive revenues by taxing big business so that we have both jobs and affordable housing.",56,,
180,0.97,1564.329,1564.696,Well said.,57,,
181,0.97,1564.696,1571.236,"Colleagues, any other comments or questions, either for--[Audio difficulty]",57,,
182,0.97,1575.44,1576.441,Okay.,58,,
183,0.97,1576.441,1580.011,I'm not seeing any other questions or comments.,58,,
184,0.97,1580.011,1596.461,"Of course, this item will be on this afternoon's agenda for our consideration and we hope to be able to hear more dialogue about it at this afternoon's full council.",58,,
185,0.97,1596.461,1600.265,But this concludes this presentation.,58,,
186,0.97,1600.265,1607.505,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you I think are the prime sponsor of the legislation so if you want to close this discussion out, now would be the time to do that.",58,,
187,0.97,1607.505,1612.243,And then we will go ahead and move into reports from Councilmembers.,58,,
188,0.97,1612.243,1614.379,"Thank you very much, Council President.",59,,
189,0.97,1614.379,1639.17,"And thanks as well to my Council colleagues for reminding us of the history of this piece of property and I think with that history, the state Legislature and our city wanted to act with urgency, but had it not been for the workers on that site and the unions that they work with that represent them and the community outcry to make sure this was a piece of property that went back to public use, it could have been a property that slipped out of the city's hands.",59,,
190,0.97,1639.17,1651.516,So I appreciate all the community continuing to raise the concerns and strongly echo the message from Councilmembers who said this needs to be reinvestment into our community where there was good living wage jobs before.,59,,
191,0.97,1651.516,1656.755,I really appreciate the presentation from Emily and her team.,59,,
192,0.97,1656.755,1657.856,"Thank you so much, Steven.",59,,
193,0.97,1657.856,1665.63,You guys have raised the flag for us to say this needs to happen before June 30th so we really appreciate the urgency in which you have put together this presentation.,59,,
194,0.97,1665.63,1669.367,Council President our hope was actually to have a vote on June 22nd.,59,,
195,0.97,1669.367,1674.806,So it gives a bit of time to have little bit more questions answered from folks.,59,,
196,0.97,1674.806,1680.345,"If that sounds okay with you, I love the urgency, but I see you nodding.",59,,
197,0.97,1680.345,1684.649,"If that's okay, we will have another week to --",59,,
198,0.97,1684.649,1686.017,Yeah.,60,,
199,0.97,1686.017,1686.251,No.,61,,
200,0.97,1686.251,1687.152,That's great.,61,,
201,0.97,1687.152,1688.586,Yeah.,62,,
202,0.97,1688.586,1688.953,"Oh, sorry.",63,,
203,0.97,1688.953,1693.425,Zoom is silly.,63,,
204,0.97,1693.425,1694.626,It keeps freezing up.,63,,
205,0.97,1694.626,1696.227,[Audio difficulty],63,,
206,0.97,1696.227,1696.561,Perfect.,64,,
207,0.97,1696.561,1696.828,Perfect.,64,,
208,0.97,1696.828,1726.324,"And then just to end, I want to lift up a few of the pieces as we center the next steps around, as Councilmember Morales described and Councilmember Sawant too, to make sure that the next phase is driven by the community who has been for a long time Re- envisioning what that area of our city looks like and to make sure that the roots that have been put down there long ago continue to remain in place and for those who maybe have been displaced to offer more places for people to come back to, I think is really important.",64,,
209,0.97,1726.324,1741.339,"And as we look at just the basics on the piece of paper or the proposal that had been worked by the city and by the state Legislature, lifting up a few pieces has already been described, this is next to light rail.",64,,
210,0.97,1741.339,1744.476,"We always talk about, this has child care included.",64,,
211,0.97,1744.476,1759.991,"Like we always talk about, this is an opportunity for us to infuse community driven priorities and services and amenities to have a partnership with labor in doing so and I think that Councilmember Sawant's point about long-term good living wage jobs is also a great reminder.",64,,
212,0.97,1759.991,1766.598,This is really another way for us to be fiscally responsible when we build on publicly owned land.,64,,
213,0.97,1766.598,1769.3,We save a tremendous amount of money in production.,64,,
214,0.97,1769.3,1789.32,"So for anybody who is watching out there, you know, the messages around build housing, build it with community oriented amenities and do it on public property to maintain public control, this is a great example and I think, as Councilmember Morales says, continuing to ask as a community voice being centered is important.",64,,
215,0.97,1789.32,1794.826,With that I am hoping to hear questions from you all in the next week and look forward to a vote on the 22nd.,64,,
216,0.97,1794.826,1803.268,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Mosqueda and my apologies for creating a little bit of confusion is not on this afternoon's agenda.",65,,
217,0.97,1803.268,1807.238,It is on next week's full council agenda.,65,,
218,0.97,1807.238,1823.021,"And office of housing folks are available to you all, as are Traci and Lish for any additional questions of clarification or mandatory work that you might want to do on these bills.",65,,
219,0.97,1823.021,1823.221,Okay.,65,,
220,0.97,1823.221,1828.927,"With that being said, we are going to thank our Presenters, Emily and Steve, for being with us.",65,,
221,0.97,1828.927,1834.566,Thank you so much for being with us this morning and you are free to Disconnect.,65,,
222,0.97,1834.566,1835.567,Thank you very much.,66,,
223,0.97,1835.567,1839.137,Have a great day.,67,,
224,0.97,1839.137,1839.504,Thank you.,67,,
225,0.97,1839.504,1839.871,Thank you.,68,,
226,0.97,1839.871,1840.138,Bye-Bye.,68,,
227,0.97,1840.138,1847.078,"Okay, colleagues, we are going to go ahead and move quickly into the preview of today's city council actions.",68,,
228,0.97,1847.078,1848.68,Council and regional committees.,68,,
229,0.97,1848.68,1868.633,"We will go ahead and do the ordinary role call rotation, which this week begins with Councilmember Pedersen, then Councilmember Sawant, Strauss, Herbold, Lewis, Morales, Mosqueda and I will conclude this agenda discussion item.",68,,
230,0.97,1868.633,1871.803,We have until 11:00 A.M.,68,,
231,0.97,1871.803,1872.403,To do our reports.,68,,
232,0.97,1872.403,1874.772,"We don't have to take up the whole hour, however.",68,,
233,0.97,1874.772,1876.407,But we have until 11:00 A.M.,68,,
234,0.97,1876.407,1888.92,And then we will transition into executive session at the end of agenda item 4. so let's go ahead and get started.,68,,
235,0.97,1888.92,1889.42,Councilmember Pedersen.,68,,
236,0.97,1889.42,1891.256,"Thank you, Council President.",69,,
237,0.97,1891.256,1891.723,"Morning, colleagues.",69,,
238,0.97,1891.723,1896.794,There are no items from the transportation and utilities Committee on today's agenda.,69,,
239,0.97,1896.794,1913.645,"Over the past two weeks I have sorted through 22,000 passionate Emails about public safety including 1,000 from district four constituents and I want to thank my constituents for sharing their views and ideas about how to Reimagine public safety.",69,,
240,0.97,1913.645,1918.182,This past week I participated in two more demonstrations for police accountability.,69,,
241,0.97,1918.182,1931.562,"One in the Wallingford neighborhood of district four on Wednesday, and then on Friday I joined 60,000 other Seattleites in a historic silent March from Judkins park to Jefferson park.",69,,
242,0.97,1931.562,1932.33,Powerful demands for change.,69,,
243,0.97,1932.33,1953.985,"We know there's much work to do to fulfill our pledge to Demilitarize our police Department, restrict the use of excessive force, increase accountability and transparency and police Union contracts, give subpoena power to our official independent oversight boards and redirect meaningful funding toward effective Community-Based alternatives.",69,,
244,0.97,1953.985,1962.427,"Very soon I look forward to voting in favor of legislation to ban Chokeholds, to ban chemical weapons and to uncover badges.",69,,
245,0.97,1962.427,1970.868,On today's introduction and referral calendar I am Co- sponsoring Council bill 119808 with Councilmember Lewis.,69,,
246,0.97,1970.868,1979.777,"This would be--this is amending or repealing, actually, section 12A.10.010 of the Seattle municipal code.",69,,
247,0.97,1979.777,2009.741,This supports the recommendation of the Seattle Re-Entry work group to repeal the prostitution Loitering law to eliminate a source of disproportionate harm to people of color--I want to thank budget chair Councilmember Mosqueda and public safety chair Councilmember Herbold and the--so we can start to leverage the budget making authority of the city council.,69,,
248,0.97,2009.741,2029.427,"I agree we must Reimagine true public safety and strategic and sustainable ways that are Antiracist and grounded in the voices, the needs and the hopes of marginalized communities so we can prevent harm and achieve healthy communities.",69,,
249,0.97,2029.427,2029.66,Thank you.,69,,
250,0.97,2033.097,2043.841,Thank you so much Councilmember Pedersen on that report.,70,,
251,0.97,2043.841,2045.643,Seeing and hearing none.,70,,
252,0.97,2045.643,2047.111,We will move to Councilmember Sawant.,70,,
253,0.97,2047.111,2047.412,Thank you.,70,,
254,0.97,2047.412,2048.479,The floor is yours.,70,,
255,0.97,2048.479,2050.314,"Thank you, president Gonzales.",71,,
256,0.97,2050.314,2051.649,"Good morning, everyone.",71,,
257,0.97,2051.649,2054.552,The movement for Lgbt rights has just won a historic victory.,71,,
258,0.97,2054.552,2061.993,Supreme Court has ruled that an employer violates Federal law when they fire someone for being gay or Transgender.,71,,
259,0.97,2061.993,2104.735,"This is truly historic and it's not as if the court of the establishment have led on this, it's decades of activism, courageous work on the streets and in the workplaces by Lgbtq rights activists and by everybody who supports having society free of oppression so congratulations to those who have fought for this over a decade, many who are not with us any longer, but it's so important that the movement has won this victory and the--alongside the Lgbtq community and this really is a great example of how when we get organized and fight, we can win.",71,,
260,0.97,2104.735,2110.675,There are no items on today's city council agenda from the sustain ability and Renters' rights committee.,71,,
261,0.97,2110.675,2116.848,Thre are two bills on today's city council agenda from my office related to the justice for George Floyd movement.,71,,
262,0.97,2116.848,2133.698,"The first bill bans the city from owning and the police from using crowd control weapons like tear gas, Mace, flash bangs, plastic bullets and other weapons that are typically used Indiscriminately on gatherings of peaceful protests.",71,,
263,0.97,2133.698,2151.282,Some of these weapons like tear gas are banned from you and--Geneva convention have been for decades and yet Mayor Durkan Úand the Seattle police under her control have repeatedly on a daily basis used them in the recent protests against the people of Seattle.,71,,
264,0.97,2151.282,2162.793,"As we discussed last week, several Councilmembers have witnessed this and those who have not have heard public testimony for days Seattle police used these weapons on the streets of Capitol Hill.",71,,
265,0.97,2162.793,2168.366,They falsely claimed that protesters were being violent or rioting or throwing projectiles.,71,,
266,0.97,2168.366,2179.21,"Chief best has doubled down on this accusation, the protest movement was throwing projectiles and that these weapons were needed to be unleashed in order to maintain safety of police.",71,,
267,0.97,2179.21,2180.545,This is absolute gas lighting.,71,,
268,0.97,2180.545,2223.154,"The police were there armed to the teeth and the--against and totally unarmed protest movement and we now have proof that the police were--violence because when mounting public outrage eventually forced Mayor Durkan to pull the police back out of the streets of Capitol Hill, the violence has left with them and now, as you know, the Capitol Hill autonomous zone or Capitol Hill organized protest, known by different terminology has now become something that has attracted global media attention for powerful example of what is possible but, of course, this is only the beginning.",71,,
269,0.97,2223.154,2226.424,We have to keep moving forward.,71,,
270,0.97,2226.424,2247.612,"But so today's bills stand in that powerful context of what has happened, not only there on Capitol Hill, but around the nation, demonstrators have been injured by these weapons and as I mentioned earlier an open letter signed by over 1,000 medical professionals explain weapons like tear gas and Mace significantly increase the danger of Covid as well.",71,,
271,0.97,2247.612,2271.268,"We need to ban these weapons and it cannot be a matter of recommend--making recommendations to the police and the political establishment that these weapons not be used because clearly, clearly those recommendations are simply not working so these bans, in my view, are the bare minimum that we should be doing as a city council.",71,,
272,0.97,2271.268,2279.41,"If Seattle passes the legislation banning chemical weapons and other so-called crowd control weapons, it will be historic.",71,,
273,0.97,2279.41,2280.544,It's not unprecedented.,71,,
274,0.97,2280.544,2284.081,"In Minneapolis the city Council, I believe, has passed such a ban.",71,,
275,0.97,2284.081,2288.552,This is being discussed throughout the nation in cities and States throughout the nation.,71,,
276,0.97,2288.552,2298.596,"Yet it will be one of the first cities that does it if Seattle does this, this afternoon, and Úthis will be extremely important for us to make possible.",71,,
277,0.97,2298.596,2301.132,And bills like this by themselves will not be enough.,71,,
278,0.97,2301.132,2306.037,But they will have a tangible impact in reducing police violence.,71,,
279,0.97,2306.037,2312.043,I will be bringing technical amendments to this bill based on certain recommendations from the city attorney's office.,71,,
280,0.97,2312.043,2316.614,My staff members have distributed them to all Councilmembers by Email.,71,,
281,0.97,2316.614,2321.752,I welcome any questions or Clarifications that maybe needed.,71,,
282,0.97,2321.752,2327.158,The amendments Rephrase two recitals and clarify the definition of crowd control weapons.,71,,
283,0.97,2327.158,2330.561,They do not make any Sbstantive policy change.,71,,
284,0.97,2330.561,2349.647,"On the agenda, there's also a bill 42 my office banning the use of Chokehold from Eric garner to Manuel Ellis to George Floyd, we have all seen the devastating consequences of Chokeholds being used as the police and, as I mentioned last week, similar restrictions put in place by other cities, most recently in Minneapolis.",71,,
285,0.97,2349.647,2353.951,Of course we need to be sober.,71,,
286,0.97,2353.951,2355.786,Chokeholds--banning Chokeholds by themselves is not enough.,71,,
287,0.97,2355.786,2367.164,"It is a necessary first step and it is a statement, but if both these bills are passed without watering down by the city, the city council will be making an important statement that this is the kind of city we want to live in.",71,,
288,0.97,2367.164,2377.375,"We don't want to live in a society where Chokeholds are harmful weapons, are a question of police opinion whether they use them or not.",71,,
289,0.97,2377.375,2382.713,We want to live in a society where they are not allowed and that they are considered abhorrent.,71,,
290,0.97,2382.713,2385.316,I think that's the main point.,71,,
291,0.97,2385.316,2389.453,In addition to actually passing the law but we need to be sober.,71,,
292,0.97,2389.453,2389.954,That won't be enough.,71,,
293,0.97,2389.954,2396.527,Chokeholds were banned in New York City when Eric garner was killed and that obviously the law was insufficient to save him.,71,,
294,0.97,2396.527,2407.705,"In addition to critical legislation like these bills, it will also be important to continue to build the movement that is actually the reason we are even having this conversation.",71,,
295,0.97,2407.705,2419.884,"But beyond that, we need real police accountability measures, like independently elected police oversight board with full powers over the police including hiring, firing and subpoena powers.",71,,
296,0.97,2419.884,2448.946,"We need to end the system of impunity, which is why the police murders of black, Brown, poor, homeless people, people with mental illness, it continues unabated just in the--in the midst of this uprising, we saw Atlanta police murder the Rayshard Brooks on Saturday after he celebrated an 88-Year-Old birthday.",71,,
297,0.97,2448.946,2456.387,These bills today are an important but only very small component of what needs to be needed.,71,,
298,0.97,2456.387,2471.368,"They are the bare minimum so I look forward to the city council voting ""Yes"" without weakening the bills or delaying because them because that will be first step to truly putting action to the words black lives matter.",71,,
299,0.97,2471.368,2488.052,"We do need an independently selective board, we need to Defund the police 50% and steps like what San Francisco has taken which is the need to go towards community, organizers, community workers as opposed to police responding to noncriminal emergency calls.",71,,
300,0.97,2488.052,2490.588,Those are important parts of Defunding the police by 50%.,71,,
301,0.97,2490.588,2494.525,And so we are going to be discussing that soon.,71,,
302,0.97,2494.525,2504.935,"Just last but not least, I wanted to say--share with the public that we should all stand with the workers at trader Joe's on Capitol Hill in Seattle.",71,,
303,0.97,2504.935,2507.638,So please sign their petition.,71,,
304,0.97,2507.638,2511.108,We will be sharing--sharing the link to the petition on our social media.,71,,
305,0.97,2511.108,2515.112,We will be posting it on our Council office Blog as well.,71,,
306,0.97,2515.112,2527.958,But as many of you may already know the store--on Capitol Hill on Madison was abruptly closed on the day that dozens employees took action in support of the movement for black lives.,71,,
307,0.97,2527.958,2538.068,In the petition the workers say that they believe the store has been closed by the executives to ward off a so-called hot spot for worker organizing.,71,,
308,0.97,2538.068,2545.976,"To quote the workers, trader Joe's corporate has aggressively squashed workers organizing for years and has a long record of retaliation.",71,,
309,0.97,2545.976,2555.786,This is the most dramatic retaliation any trader Joe's store has seen to date but it is not an isolated incident.,71,,
310,0.97,2555.786,2571.502,"Organizing to secure a living wage, health insurance for all workers and basic protections against Covid-19, the large majority of us were already living paycheck to paycheck and many of us were working without health insurance while risking steady exposure to the public in the midst of a pandemic.",71,,
311,0.97,2571.502,2580.811,We are saddened by the store closure for each of us it means both a loss of community and a lot of financial security in the midst of an economic downturn.,71,,
312,0.97,2580.811,2590.521,"We recognize it's a loss for our neighborhood as well and we hope you will join us in demanding that trader Joe's opens store number 130 and restore our jobs immediately, Unquote.",71,,
313,0.97,2590.521,2609.84,"So just wanted to let the workers at trader Joe's know that my office and Socialist alternative stand in full solidarity with them and with the black lives matter movement and that if the trader Joe's workers are watching, please contact my office and also if trader Joe's workers from outside Seattle are also watching, please contact us as well.",71,,
314,0.97,2609.84,2625.122,"As the workers point out, workers in trader Joe's throughout the country have been organizing and this fighting to open the store back again is part of the nationwide organizing.",71,,
315,0.97,2625.122,2625.422,Thank you.,71,,
316,0.97,2625.422,2625.789,Thank you.,72,,
317,0.97,2625.789,2630.06,Any questions or comments on that report?,72,,
318,0.97,2630.06,2631.895,"Councilmember Herbold, please, the floor is yours.",72,,
319,0.97,2631.895,2633.364,Thank you.,73,,
320,0.97,2633.364,2649.48,I want to again thank Councilmember Sawant for bringing forward the two bills related to banning Chokeholds in Seattle as well as banning the use of crowd control weapons.,73,,
321,0.97,2649.48,2679.109,I think folks received last week a preliminary memo from the OPA and the Oig where they let us know that think Researched whether or not there are resources out there that advocate a blanket ban of what the bill before us calls crowd control devices.,73,,
322,0.97,2679.109,2703.3,"They also say that their summary is a preliminary report and commit to continuing to gather and synthesize information about the use of crowd management tools by SPD, and make note that the analysis of the sufficiency and appropriateness of SPD policy and training related to crowd management would be a forthcoming product.",73,,
323,0.97,2703.3,2714.812,We heard from the OPA and the Oig yesterday that they have not had time to complete this product.,73,,
324,0.97,2714.812,2730.728,And they are requesting additional time as it relates not to the Chokehold legislation but to the legislation about the ban on crowd control weapons.,73,,
325,0.97,2730.728,2744.441,We know that Friday the court has issued a temporary restraining order against the city of Seattle for the use of these weapons for the next two weeks.,73,,
326,0.97,2744.441,2750.814,And also the CPC has been unable to meet to declare this legislation due to the compressed Timeline.,73,,
327,0.97,2750.814,2772.903,"I think they have a meeting scheduled on the 17th, and I think I have shared with most people, correspondence that we have received from the CDC over the weekend.",73,,
328,0.97,2772.903,2792.422,"We received a memo from the law Department which we will be discussing more later and we will also be hearing from the--we will be joined by the Apa director, the inspector general and the CPC Co-Chairs.",73,,
329,0.97,2792.422,2832.396,"Just want to sort of flag that as it relates to the Chokehold bill, if the Council does decide they want to move forward there are some amendments that if I have not already shared with you, I will do so very soon and as it relates specifically to the tear gas legislation or the crowd control weapons legislation, the amendments do things like clarify the legislation restricts crowd control weapons in scenarios of crowd dispersal and management.",73,,
330,0.97,2832.396,2845.242,It recognizes the authority of our accountability partners to advise in these matters under the 2017 accountability ordinance as approved by the Council.,73,,
331,0.97,2845.242,2880.911,"They have a statutory authority to advise us in these matters and the amendment requests a recommendation from them by Mid- August but does not hold up the implementation of the recommendation . Ing any the amendment also requires the city attorney to notify the Department of justice, the court monitor and the court itself used the forces Alt the heart of the consent decree and changes to city policies have to be submitted to the court.",73,,
332,0.97,2880.911,2897.761,"It expresses an intent for city Council to, if necessary, engage with labor relations on implementation, and it clarifies that additional damages are possible under Federal and state law to exceed the 10,000 limit in the original bill.",73,,
333,0.97,2897.761,2908.305,And then it also clarifies that the legislation applies to the alleged conduct that occurs after enactment of the legislation.,73,,
334,0.97,2908.305,2914.378,"There are a couple other small changes, but they are mostly technical.",73,,
335,0.97,2914.378,2923.186,"Again, intend to, if I haven't sent you a copy of those amendments, we will do so shortly well before the noon deadline.",73,,
336,0.97,2923.186,2930.16,"And then also as it relates to the Chokehold legislation, a couple of small amendments there too.",73,,
337,0.97,2930.16,2937.0,"Again, clarifying that the legislation applies to alleged conduct after the enactment of legislation.",73,,
338,0.97,2937.0,2950.213,"Also, like the other bill, requires the city to notify the DOJ, the monitor and the court, and then finally expresses an intent, if necessary, for the Council to engage with labor relations on implementation.",73,,
339,0.97,2950.213,2957.287,And that's all I have in response to Councilmember Sawant's report.,73,,
340,0.97,2957.287,2957.587,Thank you.,73,,
341,0.97,2957.587,2961.892,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",74,,
342,0.97,2961.892,2969.8,Any questions or comments on that aspect?,74,,
343,0.97,2969.8,2971.001,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",74,,
344,0.97,2971.001,2973.303,"Thank you, Council President.",75,,
345,0.97,2973.303,3002.866,"I am not sure, I am so sorry about not being able to see everybody who is on the zoom right now so I'm not sure if you have central staff on the line to talk about the amendments, but I guess my big question is, Okay, perhaps for the sponsor or the sponsor of the amendments, my big question is, is there a big difference between the technical amendments that Councilmember Sawant as the prime sponsor is planning to bring forward, and Councilmember Herbold the amendments you're talking about that?",75,,
346,0.97,3002.866,3023.42,"I ask that so we can better understand whether there's harmony in the ones Councilmember Sawant is bringing forward and also very briefly want to underscore the urgency of passing the legislation because I think that while the temporary restraining order was put in place on Friday, even members of that legal team have been reaching out saying, please make this permanent.",75,,
347,0.97,3023.42,3025.355,We look forward to the Council making this permanent.,75,,
348,0.97,3025.355,3033.93,"So just wanted to ask that sort of technical question about the amendments, if you will.",75,,
349,0.97,3033.93,3036.533,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",76,,
350,0.97,3036.533,3043.373,We do not have the benefit of having anyone from Council central staff on the line with us today.,76,,
351,0.97,3043.373,3046.076,This all sort of revolved very quickly.,76,,
352,0.97,3046.076,3054.751,But I would open it up to either Councilmember Herbold or Sawant to--[Audio difficulty],76,,
353,0.97,3054.751,3060.757,Perhaps react to that question posed by Councilmember Mosqueda.,77,,
354,0.97,3060.757,3069.132,"I don't think they cover the same technical issues, but I don't think there's any conflict between our amendments.",78,,
355,0.97,3069.132,3077.34,I have only glanced at Councilmember Sawant's amendments and I think Councilmember Sawant has only had the benefit of hearing me describe my amendments.,78,,
356,0.97,3077.34,3086.783,I don't think she has received them yet.,78,,
357,0.97,3086.783,3087.751,Councilmember Sawant?,79,,
358,0.97,3087.751,3089.92,My office hasn't seen the amendments.,80,,
359,0.97,3089.92,3093.156,All I heard was what she described just now.,80,,
360,0.97,3093.156,3108.004,"So we will, of course, be looking at the amendments, but I will assure the public right now that if any of the amendments are fulfilled with loopholes, I will be opposing them.",80,,
361,0.97,3108.004,3110.106,There's no question about that.,80,,
362,0.97,3110.106,3143.573,"Certainly welcome the temporary restraining order but I don't think that it is enough and, in fact, I don't--I am actually at a loss to understand how the--how any Councilmember can play a role in delaying the passage of what is absolutely bare minimum legislation to address the horrific violence that is happening in our society and that the Mayor of this city has been responsible for, so I just--I just fail to understand that.",80,,
363,0.97,3143.573,3146.977,This is not a question of training of police officers.,80,,
364,0.97,3146.977,3158.488,"The question is, do we really want to live in a society where it is at the discretion of the police or the establishment whether or not to use horrific weapons on their own constituents.",80,,
365,0.97,3158.488,3159.155,"No, absolutely not.",80,,
366,0.97,3159.155,3159.923,It should not be allowed.,80,,
367,0.97,3159.923,3177.741,"I want to live in a society where those weapons are not used at all and, Furthermore, for decades a Geneva convention has had an effect on these--these questions are being asked.",80,,
368,0.97,3177.741,3187.951,"As far as the Oig is concerned, the did the Oig ask the Federal Court not to issue a temporary restraining order because they didn't have time to come up with an opinion?",80,,
369,0.97,3187.951,3191.621,Why is it they are saying about this.,80,,
370,0.97,3191.621,3198.795,Most important the Oig has simply not earned the credibility asked for this delay because this hasn't worked.,80,,
371,0.97,3198.795,3201.598,The Oig has been aware of police abuse for years.,80,,
372,0.97,3201.598,3202.632,Activists have been demanding nation.,80,,
373,0.97,3202.632,3209.706,Now we have a nationwide and global uprising and there is pressure on the establishment to do something.,80,,
374,0.97,3209.706,3225.121,"So it's exactly the wrong way to go to say we are going to delay the legislation--the possible legislation because an entity that has been aware of police abuse and done nothing to address it is saying, we need to delay because they need to example it.",80,,
375,0.97,3225.121,3230.56,On what basis have they earned any right to examine it.,80,,
376,0.97,3230.56,3233.163,"We have tens of thousands of people in Seattle, if not more.",80,,
377,0.97,3233.163,3240.37,I haven't seen a formal poll but I can tell the society in Seattle is completely outraged at the use of these weapons.,80,,
378,0.97,3240.37,3242.973,"People are saying, this is Seattle in the 21st century.",80,,
379,0.97,3242.973,3248.445,"This is happening, this is not acceptable.",80,,
380,0.97,3248.445,3261.491,The community police Commission has not met to discuss Councilmember Herbold with legislation either and I don't understand why they should be held up by any means.,80,,
381,0.97,3261.491,3267.931,The police Commission has pointed out the--they have made those points about chemical weapons as well.,80,,
382,0.97,3267.931,3283.88,"And the bottom line is the activists and these legislation are doing what the Oig and the system has failed to do for years, which is stop police abuse.",80,,
383,0.97,3283.88,3284.214,Okay.,81,,
384,0.97,3284.214,3301.164,"I just want to clarify that Councilmember Sawant, you made a comment about how--[Audio difficulty]",81,,
385,0.97,3307.437,3323.253,"For about 18 months, so I have a hard time reconciling how they have known about police, quote, years, Unquote, when they have only been around for about 18 months.",82,,
386,0.97,3323.253,3326.222,"So, again--[Audio difficulty]",82,,
387,0.97,3326.222,3351.381,The integrity of these agencies that are part of our accountability system that the entire city council in favor of putting into--[Audio difficulty],83,,
388,0.97,3354.784,3357.42,"Council President, you're cutting out.",84,,
389,0.97,3357.42,3364.294,See if anybody else has any questions.,85,,
390,0.97,3364.294,3364.694,Yeah.,86,,
391,0.97,3364.694,3365.261,Council --,86,,
392,0.97,3365.261,3365.595,I'm sorry.,87,,
393,0.97,3365.595,3366.062,[Audio difficulty],87,,
394,0.97,3366.062,3373.369,"Yeah, you're cutting out.",88,,
395,0.97,3373.369,3374.704,"Council President, Councilmember Juarez.",88,,
396,0.97,3374.704,3376.539,"Can you hear me, Council President?",88,,
397,0.97,3376.539,3376.906,Go ahead.,89,,
398,0.97,3376.906,3377.307,Thank you.,90,,
399,0.97,3377.307,3377.907,I was going to --,90,,
400,0.97,3377.907,3380.276,I can hear you.,91,,
401,0.97,3380.276,3381.444,Great.,92,,
402,0.97,3381.444,3384.347,"Thank you, Council President.",92,,
403,0.97,3384.347,3385.749,This is Councilmember Juarez speaking.,92,,
404,0.97,3385.749,3397.127,"I just want to say, I support Councilmember Herbold in continuing this for one week in light of Judge Jones issuing the TRO.",92,,
405,0.97,3397.127,3418.081,"But more importantly what Council President shared, that we are--the Oig just came into existence in the last 18 months, but just the point that makes common sense to me is the OPA, the Oig and the community police Commission are asking for more time and they were created for this reason.",92,,
406,0.97,3418.081,3425.321,They have the subject matter expertise and we are also going to have a briefing by legal and we want to do this right.,92,,
407,0.97,3425.321,3427.724,Nobody is saying that it's okay to do this.,92,,
408,0.97,3427.724,3436.9,"Right now N█Othing is going to happen, hopefully, now that we have the TRO in place and the protesters did have standing so we will move forward in one week.",92,,
409,0.97,3436.9,3453.082,So I want to share that I support Councilmember Herbold in moving this over one week so we have more information and we can make this solid and we can make it stay and we can be legally upheld.,92,,
410,0.97,3453.082,3456.252,Thank you.,92,,
411,0.97,3456.252,3457.387,Okay.,93,,
412,0.97,3457.387,3458.488,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez.",93,,
413,0.97,3458.488,3471.401,"Colleagues, I am continue to have some Internet difficulty so I may have to call into the meeting to sort of avoid the skipping around in the feed.",93,,
414,0.97,3471.401,3479.876,But I see that Councilmember Sawant has another comment to make so I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Sawant.,93,,
415,0.97,3479.876,3484.08,And then I really want to wrap up today's conversation.,93,,
416,0.97,3484.08,3484.914,"Again, it's 10:30 A.M.",93,,
417,0.97,3484.914,3486.015,We have until 11:00 A.M.,93,,
418,0.97,3486.015,3492.021,For this before we have to transition into executive session.,93,,
419,0.97,3492.021,3500.997,"So Councilmember Sawant, I am going to let have you last word on this and then move on.",93,,
420,0.97,3500.997,3509.005,"If you all lose me due to technology, she has the list of role call and is at the ready to call on the next Councilmember.",93,,
421,0.97,3509.005,3513.142,"So Councilmember Sawant, you have the last word.",93,,
422,0.97,3513.142,3513.51,Thank you.,94,,
423,0.97,3513.51,3522.418,"It is accurate to say that the Oig itself as an entity, as an office has not been in existence for years.",94,,
424,0.97,3522.418,3559.956,"However, I think the import of my comments was very clear that the system has been in place for years, decades, the Oig itself may not have been but the Oig is simply the latest incarnation inside a system that has not worked and I do not accept that the so-called integrity of agencies that have completely let down and betrayed black and Brown community members, allowed police violence and racism to continue, violence against--violence and brutality against peaceful protest movements to continue.",94,,
425,0.97,3559.956,3568.965,"I don't think integrity is the word to use in relation to the agency that have completely failed ordinary people, especially our marginalized communities.",94,,
426,0.97,3568.965,3589.652,"I think the question is will the Council uphold the integrity in those who have been brutalized at the hands of the police and I hope that that question will be taken into consideration when the city council this afternoon votes--I think, it seems like, shamefully, to delay the legislation.",94,,
427,0.97,3589.652,3595.625,Just as an example of what kind of role the Oig is playing.,94,,
428,0.97,3595.625,3605.368,Said what about an large scale response to an active shooter or terrorist requires outside assistance where these weapons might be necessary?,94,,
429,0.97,3605.368,3614.744,The threat of terrorism has always been used especially by the right wing to curtail civil liberties and Oig is trying to raise that now.,94,,
430,0.97,3614.744,3646.209,"That was raised in very bad proceedings that happened at the Federal level, including the Patriot Act and I don't think that in Seattle we should allow that kind of specter to be raised in order to prevent such a bare minimum legislation from passing and I will maintain once again in closing that there is nothing we are going to learn in another week that we don't already know, hundreds of us that got tear gassed and Maced, we know these Legislations need to pass today without watering down.",94,,
431,0.97,3651.08,3653.149,Okay.,95,,
432,0.97,3653.149,3654.283,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,95,,
433,0.97,3654.283,3674.537,"There's a lot that I can respond to if we unpack what you just said, but I think we are going to sort of just leave it there because we really need to move along and I appreciate the opportunity to have this conversation, and let's go ahead and move through the reports.",95,,
434,0.97,3674.537,3678.341,So next up is Councilmember Strauss.,95,,
435,0.97,3678.341,3679.275,Please.,95,,
436,0.97,3679.275,3680.576,"Thank you, Council President.",96,,
437,0.97,3680.576,3681.144,Good morning colleagues.,96,,
438,0.97,3681.144,3689.485,There are no items from the land use and neighborhoods Committee on Todd's full agenda or introduction of the referral calendar.,96,,
439,0.97,3689.485,3697.627,"The next meeting of the neighbors Committee is on July 22nd, also birthday of one of our dear friends.",96,,
440,0.97,3697.627,3703.666,At full council today I will be distributing a proclamation honoring Thomas Whitmore.,96,,
441,0.97,3703.666,3707.837,He is a 19-Year veteran of the Department of neighborhoods and he's retiring this week.,96,,
442,0.97,3707.837,3716.412,"As you will hear this afternoon, his life includes tales from working all over the globe and once almost getting his haircut by Jane Goodell.",96,,
443,0.97,3716.412,3721.184,I will be excited to share with you--that's just a preview for this afternoon.,96,,
444,0.97,3721.184,3728.257,The proclamation was distributed to your offices last Friday and I look forward to you signing on.,96,,
445,0.97,3728.257,3737.8,"Looking over last week, after last Monday, we saw what happens when we meet nonviolent demonstration with first amendment rights with peace.",96,,
446,0.97,3737.8,3740.036,The reaction is peace.,96,,
447,0.97,3740.036,3752.415,We had heard actions leading up to last Monday's--up to last Monday in Capitol Hill and around the East precinct was due to a threat of arson on the East precinct.,96,,
448,0.97,3752.415,3761.324,"We did eventually see an individual attempt to light the East precinct on fire and indeed, the peaceful residents exercising their first amendment rights caught the fire immediately.",96,,
449,0.97,3761.324,3767.897,I think this is important to note that the majority of people there were there to be peaceful.,96,,
450,0.97,3767.897,3769.932,We are seeing history in the making.,96,,
451,0.97,3769.932,3775.505,Public opinion on what is and what is not acceptable public policy is changing before our eyes.,96,,
452,0.97,3775.505,3779.142,Even in the last month.,96,,
453,0.97,3779.142,3785.381,This is both a--we have the opportunity to plant seeds that will grow for generations to come.,96,,
454,0.97,3785.381,3788.851,"Sometimes all it takes it a bag of dirt, a shovel and a bag of seeds.",96,,
455,0.97,3788.851,3791.12,This is both a metaphor and our reality.,96,,
456,0.97,3791.12,3802.665,"I am glad that we have Seattle's newest community garden added to our city's land and if the creators want it to be a permanent installation, maybe it could even become a patch.",96,,
457,0.97,3802.665,3805.768,The future is left to see those answers provided to us.,96,,
458,0.97,3805.768,3818.681,It is equally important that we take this moment to create meaningful policy to reflect the changes in public opinion and create public policy that will last for generations to come.,96,,
459,0.97,3818.681,3830.693,"Additionally last week, last Wednesday, the land use and neighborhoods committee held a post adoption hearing on Council bill 119769, the emergency permitting legislation we adopted in April.",96,,

462,0.97,3837.333,3850.012,"As we experience and continue to experience this morning, it is clear that there are continuing difficulties with meeting remotely, even though zoom does work most of the time, it can be difficult from time to time.",96,,
463,0.97,3850.012,3861.724,"Also on Wednesday, my team attended the mayors industrial Maritime strategy meeting to hear from standard Stakeholders and discuss how the process can move forward given the changed landscape we are in.",96,,
464,0.97,3861.724,3869.599,Last Thursday I joined the planning Commission to discuss my child care near you proposal which will be moving forward after our summer budget season.,96,,
465,0.97,3869.599,3873.402,I also held my weekly district office hours for residents.,96,,
466,0.97,3873.402,3877.673,"We spoke about transit, homelessness, black lives matter, the police budget and cafe streets.",96,,

470,0.97,3902.465,3904.533,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",97,,
471,0.97,3904.533,3909.138,Any questions or feedback on that report?,97,,
472,0.97,3909.138,3915.111,"Hearing and seeing none, we will go ahead and move over to Councilmember Herbold.",98,,
473,0.97,3915.111,3915.544,The floor is yours.,98,,
474,0.97,3915.544,3918.014,Thank you so much.,99,,
475,0.97,3918.014,3919.515,"Good morning, everybody.",99,,
476,0.97,3919.515,3951.781,"I want to again thank Councilmember Sawant for Referencing some of the announcements coming out of San Francisco, specifically Mayor London breed announced that calls on help related to noncriminal matters involving mental health, the homeless response, school discipline and neighbor disputes, police officers will be replaced with trained, unarmed professionals to respond to calls for help.",99,,
477,0.97,3951.781,3971.767,"This is a really, I think, another example of how cities are supporting one another, as we Reimagine policing services to instead be public safety services that aren't dependent on policing.",99,,
478,0.97,3971.767,4003.232,"Just sort of tying the announcement from San Francisco to the work that we began last week in Councilmember Mosqueda's budget committee meeting, just reminding folks that we have asked central staff for a breakdown of the calls to 911 that the city receives in order to break out by type of activity in order to help us determine what a more useful and appropriate response would be to those types of calls.",99,,
479,0.97,4003.232,4037.8,"Also the city auditor has begun doing research on other jurisdictions that don't have police departments, that instead have public safety departments, that have merged the roles of police officers with firefighters and EMS responders as well as other important professionals who have subject matter expertise and can deliver more--a response to public safety issues that do not need a police response.",99,,
480,0.97,4037.8,4078.574,"Some of the work that we in Seattle have done already as it relates specifically to reestablishing the CSO program is another step in that direction and I'm really looking forward to working with the Council on this area of abusing the budget realignment process to not only make near time cuts to the police Department, but also to begin this larger discussion of what a public safety Department can look like for our city.",99,,
481,0.97,4078.574,4099.328,"In addition, we have before us today a bill, council bill 119803, which requires officers to display their badge numbers while allowing mourning bands to observe the death of officers but on a different part of the badge, not obscuring the numbers.",99,,
482,0.97,4099.328,4102.264,Contacted the council about badge numbers not being visible.,99,,
483,0.97,4102.264,4110.606,"After I announced I was drafting legislation, we know that chief best issued a directive to all officers to display their badge numbers while wearing mourning bands.",99,,
484,0.97,4110.606,4118.581,And I appreciate her order but Nevertheless this requirement must be adopted into law.,99,,
485,0.97,4118.581,4135.397,"The legislation itself AMENDS Seattle municipal code 3.28.130, which was actually created after the 1999Wto protest in Seattle when people noted they could not view the name tags of officers.",99,,
486,0.97,4135.397,4143.472,So former Councilmember Steinbrueck sponsored legislation to create a new section of the municipal code to require display of name tags.,99,,
487,0.97,4143.472,4149.111,This legislation AMENDS that and is emergency legislation and would go into effect immediately upon signature by the Mayor.,99,,
488,0.97,4149.111,4173.269,"And it also requests that the Seattle police Department work with other law enforcement agencies whose peace officers are reasonably, maybe anticipated to enforce traffic or criminal laws in Seattle to develop policy that required those peace officers when enforcing the laws in the city of Seattle to conform with requirements concerning badges.",99,,
489,0.97,4173.269,4202.865,"So that will be before us today on the full council pivoting over to the human services Department, just want to note that human services Department planning continues in partnership with the office of Sustainability and the environment to assess need and address issues related to food, transportation and distribution and provision of emergency meals at permanent supported housing locations.",99,,
490,0.97,4202.865,4213.809,And Hsd reports that one of the most pressing concerns for the aging and disabilities services decision and its service providers is recovery and preparing to go back to office and In-Person services.,99,,
491,0.97,4213.809,4220.916,Agencies are exploring a staggered return to In-Person services based on urgency.,99,,
492,0.97,4220.916,4232.061,"For example, agencies serving deaf, hard of hearing on are on a quicker Timeline to reopen due to the challenges experienced for that community with remote communication.",99,,
493,0.97,4232.061,4244.073,"As it relates to activities from last week, along with Councilmember Pedersen, I participated in the community task force.",99,,
494,0.97,4244.073,4249.411,The meeting focused on introductions and a high level briefing for community members.,99,,
495,0.97,4249.411,4256.418,At the meeting Sdot released a decision tree about the path for resolving the closure of the West Seattle bridge.,99,,
496,0.97,4256.418,4265.594,The starting point is a decision during the summer about whether a repair is feasible based on bridge structural testing that is ongoing.,99,,
497,0.97,4265.594,4275.604,"One path in the chart leads to repair with an opening as soon as 2022, with the LifeSpan of that repair of up to ten years.",99,,
498,0.97,4275.604,4282.011,In this path the bridge still would need to be replaced around 2032.,99,,
499,0.97,4282.011,4287.583,The second path leads to replacement with controlled demolition.,99,,
500,0.97,4287.583,4305.2,"Sdot estimates roughly that a new bridge could take about four to six years, opening approximately in the 2024, 2026 Timeline, depending on the type, size and location of the replacement.",99,,
501,0.97,4305.2,4320.015,"So the decision tree notes that, again, that we are poised to make a decision about a path this summer and estimates I have heard have been around four weeks.",99,,
502,0.97,4320.015,4330.025,So this is one of the most significant next steps for progress on the West Seattle bridge.,99,,
503,0.97,4330.025,4357.052,"I also last week attended the lead policy coordinating board meeting and heard about the development of the Co-Lead model and discussed concerns that despite the clear need in our city, Co-Lead is not receiving referrals from SPD right now and there is a discussion of great concern about that.",99,,
504,0.97,4357.052,4388.784,"Understanding that police officers may have their focus on other activities in the city, it is a frustration of the model for Co-Lead and for the underlying program lead that they rely on referrals from or if not always referrals, even for the social contacts approval of clients for lead.",99,,
505,0.97,4388.784,4411.44,And so the meeting was really focused on whether or not there could be a Workaround within the current contract to this problem of the fact that we are unable to get approval of referrals right now and we talked about having the city attorney play that role.,99,,
506,0.97,4411.44,4428.557,"Because basically as it relates to social contacts, the role of the police Department is to confirm the prior criminal history of the potential client.",99,,
507,0.97,4428.557,4430.092,We did not come to any solutions in this meeting.,99,,
508,0.97,4430.092,4448.076,"There was a great deal of frustration in the room because, again, the need for these services is great in the meeting, you know, folks involved in the delivery of Co- lead services were looking out their window.",99,,
509,0.97,4448.076,4468.363,They can see people in distress out their window right then during the meeting and I found that at best.,99,,
510,0.97,4468.363,4477.973,The problem with referrals at best is bureaucracy at its worst worst.,99,,
511,0.97,4477.973,4487.149,These problems could be seen as really having a very cruel impact on people who can use these services.,99,,
512,0.97,4487.149,4495.691,There are empty hotel rooms that Co-Lead has access to where people could be coming inside.,99,,
513,0.97,4495.691,4509.238,So I look forward to discussing this more with Councilmembers and seeing how we can assist Co-Lead in delivering these services.,99,,
514,0.97,4509.238,4515.244,"I want to reference, of course, that Friday is Juneteenth.",99,,
515,0.97,4515.244,4541.603,I want to recognize that since 2013 there has been a bill before Congress observing the Juneteenth independence day and I want to throw out there that we might want to consider as a city observing this important recognition of black independence in our country and to do so for our city.,99,,
516,0.97,4541.603,4561.556,"But there are both observed city holidays as well as city holidays that are not formally observed with time off, and cities enact their own holidays.",99,,
517,0.97,4561.556,4568.53,I have not found a lot of cities that have their own unique observed holidays with time off.,99,,
518,0.97,4568.53,4572.801,I spent some time over the weekend looking that up.,99,,
519,0.97,4572.801,4586.081,Berkeley does have a Malcolm X day where they close government functions and schools and of course we have our own indigenous people's day but we are open for business that day.,99,,
520,0.97,4586.081,4609.705,I want to throw out there that given the fact that there has been an effort before Congress since 2013. one of the events going on is a rally at 1:00 P.M.,99,,
521,0.97,4609.705,4610.205,At Judkins park.,99,,
522,0.97,4610.205,4627.589,"The goal is to educate the public on the things that our city, state and county can do to address the impediments to justice, police accountability and equality.",99,,
523,0.97,4627.589,4633.962,Make sure we have representations from all levels of government to have this conversation about where the gaps lie.,99,,
524,0.97,4633.962,4642.17,You can find more information about this event at Www.Notthistime.Global.,99,,
525,0.97,4642.17,4666.762,"I am going to be speaking at the next steps event about the Council's efforts regarding the Seattle police Department's budget and some of the speakers thus far include families impacted by police use of deadly force, leaders, Congress people, Adam Smith and Pramila Jayapal.",99,,

532,0.97,4712.741,4713.442,That's the running list.,99,,
533,0.97,4713.442,4719.381,And I contacted everybody over the weekend about this event.,99,,
534,0.97,4719.381,4731.493,Andra Teller is very interested in having as much representation from the city council as possible and is trying to do in advance of the day Headcount.,99,,
535,0.97,4731.493,4739.0,"So if you haven't already, please do let me know whether or not you will be able to attend and to those of you who have already gotten back to me, thank you.",99,,
536,0.97,4739.0,4739.801,That's all I have for today.,99,,
537,0.97,4746.374,4749.277,Thank you for that report.,100,,
538,0.97,4749.277,4753.548,Any questions or comment for Councilmember Herbold?,100,,
539,0.97,4753.548,4764.659,"Hearing and seeing nothing, Councilmember Herbold, I have one point of feedback for you.",100,,
540,0.97,4764.659,4813.241,"I received a rather disturbing message from a constituent who is a lawyer, who primarily works with victims of domestic violence and has a longtime career as a public defender and she indicated that she has been trying to get protection orders served by the Seattle police Department who have told her that they are one to two weeks behind in serving protection orders, specifically from the domestic violence service unit, and that the reason that has been provided to her is because officers have been pulled from the domestic violence service unit to do crowd control in the demonstrations and what not.",100,,
541,0.97,4813.241,4825.253,And so this is just something that she received as of last Thursday in terms of response from the Seattle police Department.,100,,
542,0.97,4825.253,4840.368,"Obviously, it's of significant operational concern and just impact concern if we are seeing the situation in which domestic violence protection orders are being delayed by one to two weeks in terms of service.",100,,
543,0.97,4840.368,4854.816,So wanted to flag that for you as our public safety chair in hopes that you would be able to hopefully dig into that a little bit and provide us and the general public with some additional information about that aspect.,100,,
544,0.97,4854.816,4856.218,Thank you so much.,101,,
545,0.97,4856.218,4858.82,I am happy to follow up on that.,101,,
546,0.97,4858.82,4895.323,You're giving me an opportunity also to reference the fact that I did not mention in my remarks the fact that I have inquired with the Mayor's office to find out why it is that chief best is telling the public that responses to 911 calls in the East precinct will take three times as long as they would under ordinary circumstances.,101,,
547,0.97,4895.323,4942.804,"This is another issue that we have a police Department that is telling us that policing responses in this case, their responsibility to deliver DD orders, as well as the responsibility to respond to 911 calls, as well as the responsibility to approve Co- lead referrals, just have a lot of concern about the response from the police Department about their ability to do the work that we depend on them to do in this time and our citing the need for crowd control as the reason for that.",101,,
548,0.97,4942.804,4946.841,I will absolutely add this to the other two issues I mentioned earlier.,101,,
549,0.97,4946.841,4948.543,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",102,,
550,0.97,4948.543,4976.638,"And I think, colleagues, frankly, that this kind of response or reaction to the conversation that we are having right now about Defunding the Seattle police Department and Reimagining public safety, I certainly think these examples related to referrals and certification of who gets into the Co-Lead program, service of protection orders related to domestic violence and who knows what other issues are not getting attention right now.",102,,
551,0.97,4976.638,4990.585,Certainly makes the case for me as to why we need to continue to have this conversation around right SIZING the police Department in a way that is consistent with our expectations and the expectations of the public.,102,,
552,0.97,4990.585,5033.895,"So, you know, this is an opportunity for us to sort of look at the lines of service, if you will, that the police Department is engaging in right now, and right SIZING Accordingly to make sure that this type of work, if it's not being Prioritized by the police Department, which apparently it seems not to be, that, again, that makes the case as to why it is even that much more important for us to make sure that we are taking these facts into consideration as we continue to have the conversation and the debate around what we want public safety, policing and emergency services to look like at the city of Seattle in the long term.",102,,
553,0.97,5033.895,5065.226,"Obviously, we have short-term needs right now related to these important public safety issues and in the short term, while we were doing this long- term work, it is important for us to have confidence that our police Department is going to continue to provide these services in a manner that is responsive to community needs, and look forward to our ongoing conversation in that space and Councilmember Herbold your leadership as we move forward in that conversation.",102,,
554,0.97,5065.226,5071.299,Any other questions or comments for Councilmember Herbold and her report?,102,,
555,0.97,5071.299,5072.167,"Okay, hearing and seeing none.",102,,
556,0.97,5072.167,5077.539,We will go ahead and move onto Councilmember Juarez.,102,,
557,0.97,5077.539,5078.406,Great.,103,,
558,0.97,5078.406,5080.975,Thank you Council President.,103,,
559,0.97,5080.975,5081.276,Let's see.,103,,
560,0.97,5081.276,5086.314,There are no items on the public asset and native communities committee this afternoon agenda.,103,,
561,0.97,5086.314,5088.45,Do a quick overview here.,103,,
562,0.97,5088.45,5106.0,"I should note, though, that I'm very pleased and happy that the chief librarian Marcellus Turner, the superintendent of parks, Jesus Aguirre, are in weekly contact with me which I appreciate.",103,,
563,0.97,5106.0,5112.207,So we are monitoring public projects and construction projects and related legislation that hopefully we can tee up soon.,103,,
564,0.97,5112.207,5144.873,"Update on parks, again, you will get a weekly update Email from our office regarding park usage and now, if we are talking about the modified phase one under King County's modified phase one, a number of Seattle park and Rec and outdoor activities will resume with social distancing restrictions, as always, that would include and we are moving forward with outdoor tennis and basketball courts, disk golf, community gardens and skate parks are now open for public use.",103,,

569,0.97,5178.006,5193.888,"I want to thank and congratulate Dean al sop in our office, our new district director and Murphy Bush, both of them graduated with their Mpas and we got to watch the graduation at 4:00 Thursday.",103,,

573,0.97,5203.264,5206.901,That's about it.,103,,
574,0.97,5206.901,5207.669,Thank you guys.,103,,
575,0.97,5207.669,5209.737,Great.,104,,

584,0.97,5236.598,5246.307,Council bill 119807 repealing the drug traffic Loitering ordinance which I'm intrusion with Councilmember Morales as Co-Experience.,105,,
585,0.97,5246.307,5248.209,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,105,,
586,0.97,5248.209,5263.791,"And counsel bill 119808 repealing the prostitution, Loitering ordinance which has been Co-Sponsored by Councilmembers Pedersen and Councilmember Morales.",105,,
587,0.97,5263.791,5270.898,Essentially Criminalized stereotypes and the active hanging out and looking like the stereotype of a drug dealer or sex worker.,105,,
588,0.97,5270.898,5289.917,"I stress that point because in scenarios where actual enforcement of the underlying issue, so drug dealing or the Act of exchanging sex for money, there are different statutes Criminalizing those activity, possession with intent to distribute and prostitution.",105,,
589,0.97,5289.917,5308.169,"So for that reason, the statutes have really only had the effect of Criminalizing Circumstantial and completely innocent behavior because if there was something there, there's other statutes that people would be prosecuted under.",105,,
590,0.97,5308.169,5328.656,"So city attorney Holmes supports both of these repeals and indeed has had an office policy against charging these crimes for the last two years, but the election of a new city attorney could change that and for that reason, we should just go ahead and make it permanent, indeed, a permanent repeal was recommended by the city's Re- entry of policy report.",105,,
591,0.97,5367.028,5395.523,"We believe that this will accommodate the policy goal of making sure that workers in our gig economy will make sure that they are adequately compensated for time, and time spent on acquiring Ppe and Disinfectant, and that is compensated and that they are getting some due consideration for that, and the essential work that they are doing.",106,,
592,0.97,5395.523,5402.23,We think that this bill is important and we look forward to its consideration at full council that afternoon.,106,,
593,0.97,5402.23,5416.911,"Like a number of us here, at the Council, I did have the opportunity over the weekend to visit the chop formerly known as the Chaz, and we witnessed peaceful protest.",106,,
594,0.97,5416.911,5466.861,"I will echo other observations, I witnessed people dancing, collaborating on public health regarding projects, holding meetings on race and I did see that the protesters have been negotiating although I did not witness this myself, but negotiating with the chief and other first responders to make sure that their Ingress and Egress for emergency services--everything that I saw consistent with the occupation of academic buildings in the 1960s or the occupy movement, of 10 years ago, I respect the folks that are in the chop, for making peaceful protest.",106,,
595,0.97,5466.861,5474.769,I was appalled but not surprised to see Depictions of the chop depicted different.,106,,
596,0.97,5474.769,5487.582,I hate to say this but I think it is far more likely that the chop will become a branch campus of the college then in the con used Communist state.,106,,
597,0.97,5487.582,5499.393,"I look forward to working with them as traitors in the chop to make progress on a lot of these issues, that we have had around our criminal legal system in American policing.",106,,
598,0.97,5499.393,5501.195,"With that, I have no further update.",106,,
599,0.97,5501.195,5507.235,I look forward to another week of working with all of you for the people of the city of Seattle.,106,,
600,0.97,5507.235,5518.012,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Lewis.",107,,
601,0.97,5518.012,5519.547,Any questions or comments on that report?,107,,
602,0.97,5519.547,5524.952,"Okay, seeing and hearing then we will go move along.",107,,
603,0.97,5524.952,5525.453,Councilmember Morales?,107,,
604,0.97,5525.453,5532.059,"Thank you, good morning colleagues, I want to begin by thanking Council number Herbold for acknowledging Juneteenth.",108,,
605,0.97,5532.059,5544.672,"For those of you who do not know it is commemorating June 19, which was the date that slaves in Texas were actually made aware of the fact that they had been freed two years before.",108,,
606,0.97,5544.672,5553.18,"So as a native Texan, it is an important time to commemorate what should have been celebrated much sooner.",108,,
607,0.97,5553.18,5568.596,I already made comments about the facility so I do intend to watch that closely and we want to make sure that as I said before we are centering equity in that community in that neighborhood as the project continues.,108,,
608,0.97,5568.596,5592.186,"So, there are no items from the community economic development Committee on today's agenda because we know we are all now in a budget process, that will include conversations about both aggressive revenue, and the call that we are hearing from our community now, to Defund the police.",108,,
609,0.97,5592.186,5597.425,"So, I want to take a couple of minutes to zoom out, and allow this body a chance to reflect on what that means, for us.",108,,
610,0.97,5597.425,5602.33,We have a budget shortfall of hundreds of millions of dollars copper 2020.,108,,
611,0.97,5602.33,5606.6,We are in a hole that we have to fill making significant cuts.,108,,
612,0.97,5606.6,5612.506,"We have an opportunity to raise significant new revenue, I taxing the largest corporations in the city.",108,,
613,0.97,5612.506,5621.415,And we will require them to invest in our communities in a way that they have not done before.,108,,
614,0.97,5621.415,5628.923,We have to from our neighbors to cut the budget to SPD and invest in the community.,108,,
615,0.97,5628.923,5638.666,"So, as we begin to weigh our choices, I want to be clear that my North Star for these discussions will be about disrupting and dismantling what supremacy.",108,,
616,0.97,5638.666,5649.677,"Everything about how these institutions work will be questioned, need to be questions if we are really going to be investing in our community that Centrals around racial equity.",108,,
617,0.97,5649.677,5662.723,"So, as we discussed what defining the police Department really means, because let's be honest, we haven't asked ourselves these questions yet, we should ask what do the police do all day?",108,,
618,0.97,5662.723,5679.907,"And, if what they do is respond to people dealing with mental illness, to people experiencing homelessness, to young people who are hanging out, then we have a problem.",108,,
619,0.97,5679.907,5681.509,The police shouldn't be responding to those calls.,108,,
620,0.97,5681.509,5682.576,It is not their job.,108,,
621,0.97,5682.576,5683.844,They are not trained social workers.,108,,
622,0.97,5683.844,5684.812,These things are not crimes.,108,,
623,0.97,5684.812,5701.228,"So, we really to build community safety in a way that does not center police, and when we say Defund the police, you know, what we mean is shrink their responsibility and shrink their funding.",108,,
624,0.97,5701.228,5723.35,"In organizing spaces that really focus on disruption, and I will say many of those organizations come from my district, so you know, there is an important guiding principle to that work, which is that we spend about 20% of our time dismantling the current system, but we really spend 80% of our time building community alternatives.",108,,
625,0.97,5723.35,5730.925,"And, I just want to make clear we already have a lot of these alternatives in place.",108,,
626,0.97,5730.925,5753.247,"We have the corner Greeter program, we have community Passageways, we have the reach program that serves in the street outreach to our homeless neighbors, so we have the Colonel of what we need, and that is how we achieve the kind of Transformational change that people are asking for.",108,,
627,0.97,5753.247,5763.491,"As a city Council, we have to be prepared to provide significant resources that help scale these programs that are already doing this hard work, on the front lines.",108,,
628,0.97,5763.491,5772.967,"You know, we received an Email from our director of the office of civil rights a couple of weeks ago, saying we have to create a budget for black lives.",108,,
629,0.97,5772.967,5782.076,"And, that means that we invest in diversion, and homelessness out reach, not in navigation teams.",108,,
630,0.97,5782.076,5784.879,"We invest in libraries and community health centers, not in jails.",108,,
631,0.97,5784.879,5794.889,"We invest in violence prevention, restorative justice, Job-Training programs, not in Ephesus patrol.",108,,
632,0.97,5794.889,5800.795,"We invest in community led development, that includes resources for land acquisition and site control.",108,,
633,0.97,5800.795,5831.659,"In other words, we invest in community economic develop, that is how we are going to solve this problem, that is how we are going to demonstrate our commitment to black lives by investing in black communities and the Transformational change that we need really means that we have to do everything we can, to close the wealth gap that has existed between our Black-And-White neighbors, for hundreds of years.",108,,
634,0.97,5831.659,5855.983,"So, I am looking forward to these conversations, they are Únot going to be easy, we have lot of different balls in the air, but I think they are all channeling us, to think about how we transform the way we invest, the way we commit resources, at the city and the way we ask more from our corporate neighbors, to help achieve the goals that we have in the city, and I look forward to working with all of you to do that.",108,,
635,0.97,5855.983,5857.851,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",109,,
636,0.97,5857.851,5863.757,Any questions or comments?,109,,
637,0.97,5863.757,5869.196,"Okay, hearing and seeing none, we will go ahead and move over now to Councilmember Mosqueda.",109,,
638,0.97,5869.196,5869.463,Please?,109,,
639,0.97,5869.463,5878.572,"Thank you, good morning everybody, there are no items from the Finance and housing Committee on today's full council agenda.",110,,

659,0.97,6041.969,6052.479,I want to take a minute to lift up some of the comments that have been shared including our Council President including long-term and short-term goals.,110,,
660,0.97,6052.479,6071.765,Counsel colleagues have talked about our responsibility in this moment and I think the most important thing for us to continue to underscore is that as elected officials our job is to protect residents especially now to protect first amendment rights.,110,,
661,0.97,6071.765,6076.003,The message that was sent out last week I was to immediately halt the use of military force against community members.,110,,
662,0.97,6076.003,6082.91,"I want to lift up some of the comments from our city council members, the community, and within our own city Department, from the office of civil rights, their letter has been Referenced.",110,,
663,0.97,6082.91,6094.621,"Harmoniously this demands that as a first step, as the bare minimum we ceased the use of flash grenades, rubber bullets, tear gas, indiscriminate against community processors in order to De-Escalate the situation.",110,,

666,0.97,6111.538,6118.078,"And, yes, that has happened over the last seven days, and I appreciate the tone, the tone has changed about protesters, and the Tech this tactics have changed.",110,,
667,0.97,6118.078,6130.491,"However, those messages, as Councilmember Herbold mentioned, were undermined by the chief and we need more information about where those potential threats are coming from.",110,,
668,0.97,6130.491,6161.088,"And, beyond tone, we need structural change, we absolutely cannot let the end goal, the long-term goal be sort of pushed to the side or put on the to do list for later, right now, we are being demanded that we take action on institutional change, to redirect the budget, people have been saying this is a crisis of consciousness and inaction.",110,,
669,0.97,6161.088,6172.399,"And now we have a chance to change that, by making the necessary changes to the budget, and as our counsel colleagues talked about, especially the safety chair, true policy changes about what we expect of our police force, if there is to be redirection to funds, that we must do this through community led priorities.",110,,

671,0.97,6178.805,6197.691,"And, actionable leadership in the long-term, there has been a number of things listed but I want to lift up some of the things from the office of civil rights letter, release and do not prosecute them in Streeters, that is an actionable leadership and I think we can all work toward that because we are exercising the first amendment right.",110,,
672,0.97,6197.691,6205.332,Reported ties the city's budget to invest in the communities and decrease funding by the percent.,110,,

677,0.97,6225.652,6233.66,And hold them accountable for using excessive force.,110,,
678,0.97,6233.66,6250.677,"Get those who are being investigated off the street right now, we have a long list from the inspector general about the type of investigation they are conducting, I want to make sure that those folks who are being investigated are not currently on our street, and that we have taken action.",110,,

683,0.97,6275.569,6281.041,We need actionable commitment to move away from harmful policies and Patters that have been killing black community members.,110,,
684,0.97,6281.041,6308.602,"And, today, I think that the bill that has been introduced as part of that, I think again these are first step measures as we look at the institutional changes that are needed, I want to lift up some of the comments that were summarized very well, by FCC, if you have not been able to look at those, they were listed in the summary Friday, but the temporary restraining order on the use of nonlethal weapons.",110,,
685,0.97,6308.602,6323.05,"They summarize it by saying the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the city violated first amendment and for the minute rights, while acknowledging quote the record is limited, at this stage,"".",110,,
686,0.97,6323.05,6331.358,"He Nevertheless determined that on some occasions SPD has in fact used less lethal weapons this proportionately, and without provocation.",110,,
687,0.97,6331.358,6358.885,"Spd's actions, the judge concluded, would show a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to protest, the less lethal weapons have been used, point of have established a threat of immediate irreparable harm, in the absence of a temporary restraining order.",110,,
688,0.97,6358.885,6362.355,Plaintiffs have shown that the protests were a substantial or motivating factor in SPD's conduct.,110,,
689,0.97,6362.355,6372.566,In order to see they were demonstrating police brutality motivated him to respond the way they did.,110,,
690,0.97,6372.566,6375.802,Those are the judge's words.,110,,
691,0.97,6375.802,6398.759,"So, I want to thank David Perez, one of the lead attorneys in filing this temporary restraining order request, and in doing that on behalf of the community who was harmed by the response, and I know that they are looking forward to us putting that temporary restraining order into permanent action, I look forward to the conversation, on the bills today and taking permanent action.",110,,
