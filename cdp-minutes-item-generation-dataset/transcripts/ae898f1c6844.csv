52,0.97,234.5,239.606,"Last week in district six, woodland park update.",18,,
53,0.97,239.606,249.949,"They outreach plan ended last week in phase 3. after four months of intensive outreach, we moved 85 people out of the park and into shelter, transitional or permanent supportive housing.",18,,
54,0.97,249.949,254.721,This is the largest number of people in city history connected with shelter and services through the process of encampment removal.,18,,
55,0.97,254.721,260.76,This is because January we created a binding list.,18,,
56,0.97,260.76,265.598,"In February, we finished a needs assessment for the folks and began moving people inside and out of woodland park.",18,,
57,0.97,265.598,274.574,The Timeline of the encampment removal was dictated by shelter throughput as we do not have a shelter expansion during this time.,18,,
58,0.97,274.574,283.216,This extended the amount of time it took compared to if we had received shelter expansion during this period of time.,18,,
59,0.97,283.216,288.955,"During this, more people moved into the park not on the original census.",18,,
60,0.97,288.955,295.662,"In the last two weeks before the end of phase 3, we searched Everts to account for everyone in the park.",18,,
61,0.97,295.662,319.118,"Phase 3, we were able to make 39 referrals in the week leading up to and on the day of removal including 27 of the folks who are shouldered on the day of the removal because we had spent the time needed to create plans for them and that week leading up.",18,,
62,0.97,319.118,321.087,"Totaling 85 people, since January, connected with shelter or housing services.",18,,
63,0.97,321.087,330.263,A lesson learned is one we already knew going in which was that success is dependent on adequate shelter availability.,18,,
64,0.97,330.263,333.032,The pandemic ended the use of a Congregant shelter which is an important and positive step.,18,,
65,0.97,333.032,339.906,Now the base shelter option is 24/7 enhanced shelter where you can have a pet in your possession and be with your partner.,18,,
66,0.97,339.906,344.11,This is a better model than what we relied on previously.,18,,
67,0.97,344.11,350.35,We know most people desire personal space.,18,,
68,0.97,350.35,353.119,A shelter or housing option that has four walls and a door they can lock.,18,,
69,0.97,353.119,359.425,Currently the city does not have a shelter and we are doing now more than ever before.,18,,
70,0.97,359.425,364.831,Our shelter is dependent on housing resources we fund from permanent supportive to low income housing.,18,,
71,0.97,364.831,372.372,"Last year was the first year we met as a city, meeting the target of $200 million per year for investing in housing.",18,,
72,0.97,372.372,380.146,That was due to the Jumpstart tax and the housing levy as well as Federal Covid relief funding.,18,,
73,0.97,380.146,390.156,We cannot lose sight of funding housing needs and we need to scale up the shelter capacity while permanent housing is being built.,18,,
74,0.97,390.156,405.738,"I'm confident that the approach model we used at woodland park and Ballard Commons, which gives professional outreach workers the time they need to build relationships and assess individual needs, contributed to the large number of people accepting shelter and housing.",18,,
75,0.97,405.738,413.212,I believe the model will stand the test of time and be used as a model for getting people inside across the city.,18,,
76,0.97,413.212,422.488,Mayor Bruce Harrell's office and I worked Collaboratively with agencies and neighbors for months to reach this positive resolution.,18,,
77,0.97,422.488,430.329,The collaboration allowed for unified team of governmental and nongovernmental agencies to focus on getting people inside and to return the park to its use is designed.,18,,
78,0.97,430.329,447.18,"We would not have been able to shelter and House 83 people without the partnership with Evergreen treatment services, the neighborhood Association, the King County regional homeless authority and Mayor Harrell's W Mayor Tiffany Washington's leadership.",18,,
79,0.97,447.18,454.987,"I want to thank all the outreach workers, clean cities team, human services Department and Seattle parks and recreation for their efforts.",18,,
80,0.97,454.987,457.256,"It is difficult, challenging and often times thankless.",18,,
81,0.97,457.256,468.401,"And often times, the work goes unnoticed by so many just in case they are listening and even if you are not, I want to take a moment to give you the public recognition that you deserve.",18,,
82,0.97,468.401,486.986,"After four months of intensive outreach, and unprecedented 85 individuals living in tents and Rv's at woodland park were successfully removed to shelter and housing with the services they need and that is thanks to the train professional outreach workers from the city's hope team and reach.",18,,
83,0.97,486.986,492.291,And these referrals helped people secure safer and more stable living conditions.,18,,

165,0.97,1178.577,1206.972,This is a location that I have asked for and received significant support from executive departments to do things like Rv remediation and the purple bag project with litter pickup and addressing the needs of folks living in the Rvs for Rv Pumpout spirit making sure the waste is not going into the stream.,19,,
166,0.97,1206.972,1217.616,And the fact that the executive is beginning to start enforcement of the 72 hour notice.,19,,
167,0.97,1217.616,1219.985,The 72 hour parking ordinance.,19,,
168,0.97,1219.985,1232.331,I have begun to have conversations with executives about how they intend to Prioritize locations.,19,,
169,0.97,1232.331,1249.881,"This is not the first time I have had a conversation with the executive but it is the first time I have had interaction about this location, since the announcement that they are going to begin to identify locations throughout the city for Prioritization for enforcement.",19,,
170,0.97,1249.881,1257.155,I have discussed this area with the Southwest precinct captain nearly every time I meet with him or his predecessor.,19,,
171,0.97,1257.155,1272.738,I appreciate captain Rivera recently providing a breakdown of police responses to calls over the last several months at this location.,19,,
172,0.97,1272.738,1277.376,And I think it is important to notice that the Council did approve funding for a safe lots program last year.,19,,
173,0.97,1277.376,1284.583,"As we all know, the previous administered and did not inform at the Council's funding.",19,,
174,0.97,1284.583,1289.021,"I'm so at that time, the funds moved from the city over to the King County regional homelessness authority.",19,,
175,0.97,1289.021,1307.673,It is about $2 million when you add in the county money and Rha has issued an Rfp for the funds and has also convened a vehicle Residency work group working on pollution for vehicle residents across a lot of specific sub plans.,19,,
176,0.97,1307.673,1318.016,"As it relates to the particular location, a suspect was arrested for the first shooting and is in jail.",19,,
177,0.97,1318.016,1349.548,And really want to urge the executives to continue the work in developing objective criteria for how to Prioritize the enforcement of the 72 hour ordinance in a way that recognizes the impacts of ongoing residential activity in neighborhoods and around business districts.,19,,
178,0.97,1349.548,1351.283,I feel like it should not be an approach.,19,,
179,0.97,1351.283,1356.621,I think we all agree that the squeaky wheel gets the grease.,19,,
180,0.97,1356.621,1366.765,But the criteria should really focus on the impact of residential Rvs living in these areas.,19,,
181,0.97,1366.765,1387.886,"And as part of that, the development of that objective criteria, it is important that the city also consider the history of crime in that area as well.",19,,
182,0.97,1387.886,1389.187,It is a difficult endeavor indeed.,19,,
183,0.97,1389.187,1397.229,Especially considering that there is an estimate of 400 Rvs throughout the city that folks are living in.,19,,
184,0.97,1397.229,1429.795,"I want to also close out my remarks with recognition that, as we read the news this weekend about the horrible racially motivated attacks and murders in Buffalo, New York, I really urge us to also spend time thinking about extremism and racial hate in our own community and in our workforce as recorded in Mid-February.",19,,
185,0.97,1429.795,1432.03,And we know there was a news found in fire station 24.,19,,
186,0.97,1432.03,1436.701,This was the second one found in the recent years.,19,,
187,0.97,1436.701,1454.352,We all received a letter last week from the city's Rsji network stating their concerns and asking about actions being taken about this terror inducing activity.,19,,
188,0.97,1454.352,1457.189,A quick exit from the letter.,19,,
189,0.97,1457.189,1460.459,Both fire station 17 and 24 have black officers and leadership within the organization.,19,,
190,0.97,1460.459,1470.402,The threat for black employees to know your place has deep historical roots in America tracing back to slavery.,19,,
191,0.97,1470.402,1479.277,"This targeted attack was attempted to make our black colleagues fear for their safety, security and life.",19,,
192,0.97,1479.277,1497.195,"As we are sure you agree, we know this behavior is beyond unacceptable and is a violation of the workplace equity of equity, inclusion and accountability and falls under the definition of malicious Harassment at the workplace.",19,,
193,0.97,1497.195,1500.632,I did express my concerns with chief Scoggins back in February when the news was initially found.,19,,
194,0.97,1500.632,1504.769,I have Folowed up since receiving the letter to inquire about what steps have been taken.,19,,
195,0.97,1504.769,1522.687,"Today, with chief Scoggins, I want to highlight that I have been working with Sdhr director, Dr. Khan, to support her efforts to develop Anti- extremism curriculum for city employees.",19,,
196,0.97,1522.687,1525.39,"If you have questions about that, don't hesitate to get in touch.",19,,
197,0.97,1525.39,1534.199,I would like to have the Council build some additional support for those efforts coming out of Sdhr.,19,,
198,0.97,1534.199,1551.182,"As far as events coming up, this coming week, I just want to highlight that this week, we have a board of health meeting on Thursday where we will be continuing a conversation about the State-Mandated restructure of the board.",19,,
199,0.97,1551.182,1566.932,"And my meeting with public health directors last week, we did discuss ways that the county and the city might ensure access to abortion for residents, or anyone seeking abortion care in Seattle.",19,,
200,0.97,1566.932,1569.734,The directors also informed me of the troubling increase in congenital Syphilis statewide.,19,,
201,0.97,1569.734,1577.108,Congenital Syphilis is incredibly dangerous for babies but it is entirely treatable if it is found in time.,19,,
202,0.97,1577.108,1588.019,"I just want to say how grateful I am for public health, for the close monitoring of the data and the response to provide treatment directly to patients in the field under a standing order.",19,,

447,0.97,3540.803,3546.242,This amendment would allow the consent Calendarto include the administrative items where there is no debate.,39,,

450,0.97,3560.99,3564.16,This would relieve the Council President from making the determination on which resolutions allow for Abstentions.,39,,

523,0.97,4219.882,4222.318,We have seen some of that in our region and in our city.,39,,
524,0.97,4222.318,4227.356,My only hope and prayer is that that is not who we are.,39,,
