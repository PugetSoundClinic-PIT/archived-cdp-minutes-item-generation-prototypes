195,0.97,1383.615,1388.687,The property manager is a for profit company.,32,,
196,0.97,1388.687,1397.529,The Renters have struggled in vain for years to get the owners and property managers of their buildings to address their concerns.,32,,
197,0.97,1397.529,1401.733,The Renters are working people who make our city run.,32,,
198,0.97,1401.733,1406.438,"They are seniors, they are families with children.",32,,
199,0.97,1406.438,1410.809,An overwhelming number of them belong to communities of color.,32,,
200,0.97,1410.809,1414.713,The vast majority of the tenants are low income.,32,,

207,0.97,1445.076,1458.89,"Not only have those people failed to address the numerous problems in housing code violations, many of them extreme, they have also sent rent increase notices to many of the tenants.",32,,
208,0.97,1458.89,1464.996,"In fact, most of the tenants, the rent increases are at least $100.",32,,
209,0.97,1464.996,1469.401,We have heard from tenants that they are facing more than 100 dollar rent increases.,32,,
210,0.97,1469.401,1473.705,The tenants are demanding the rent increases and demanding all the housing code violations be fixed.,32,,
211,0.97,1473.705,1489.12,"They are demanding that the property manager and the landlord end discrimination based on race, nationality, language or otherwise.",32,,
212,0.97,1489.12,1493.625,And they are demanding that there is sufficient maintenance staff to address the repair concerns in a timely manner.,32,,
213,0.97,1493.625,1502.1,My office's community organizers have talked to more than 150 tenants.,32,,
214,0.97,1502.1,1510.742,"We have zoned off the buildings, and we have also urged community supports.",32,,
215,0.97,1510.742,1516.147,That has resulted in at least 144 Emails to S.E.E.D.,32,,
216,0.97,1516.147,1517.249,From Renters throughout the city.,32,,
217,0.97,1517.249,1521.253,From community members who are outraged about the situation.,32,,

219,0.97,1533.565,1547.145,"That rally was covered by Komo TV and it was also reported in the stranger, in the Capitol Hill Seattle Blog and in the Emerald.",32,,
220,0.97,1547.145,1561.693,"Following that, my office organized a press conference on Wednesday, October 27th, where we had absolutely Riveting and moving testimony from the Renters themselves, the tenants themselves on the conditions they are facing.",32,,
221,0.97,1561.693,1569.567,"I mean, these stories are just stunning, but there are too many to share during the briefing.",32,,
222,0.97,1569.567,1574.005,I would urge Councilmembers to look at the Blog from my office will be posting the Video testimony of all these tenants.,32,,
223,0.97,1574.005,1576.908,I just wanted to share one specific story from a woman I spoke to.,32,,
224,0.97,1576.908,1578.376,"A tenant, a black senior.",32,,
225,0.97,1578.376,1582.213,A lifelong Seattle community member.,32,,

227,0.97,1588.42,1592.991,She is on section 8. she is a low income person and she has received a $240 rent increase.,32,,
228,0.97,1592.991,1596.428,This is just unspeakable the way these tenants are being treated.,32,,
229,0.97,1596.428,1610.742,We have really started a major organizing efforts with the tenants who are really desiring to fight and win something substantial here.,32,,
230,0.97,1610.742,1619.551,"I sent an Email to Councilmember Morales, also to other county Councilmembers.",32,,
231,0.97,1619.551,1621.419,"Estate representative, a state Senator.",32,,
232,0.97,1621.419,1626.358,Urging all of them to send the letter that I sent to S.E.E.D.,32,,
233,0.97,1626.358,1632.03,"And C.O.A.S.T., or at the very least send their own letters.",32,,
234,0.97,1632.03,1637.969,My office also submitted hundreds of complaints on behalf of the tenants to the Seattle Department of construction and inspection.,32,,
235,0.97,1637.969,1642.474,And my staff have also sent--have contacted the Seattle I.T.,32,,
236,0.97,1642.474,1656.454,"Department to begin addressing one of the major housing code violations, and also violations of the rights of section 8 voucher holders, is the lack of low-cost Internet.",32,,
237,0.97,1656.454,1659.758,"Which has been absent, the access to low-cost Internet has been absent since 2017.",32,,
238,0.97,1659.758,1671.002,"Obviously access to Internet, affordable Internet, access to affordable Broadband is a basic need now in our society.",32,,
239,0.97,1671.002,1679.411,Especially during the pandemic here for these low income seniors and communities of color to not have access is just completely outrageous.,32,,
240,0.97,1679.411,1681.713,"My office, as I said has written to S.E.E.D.",32,,
241,0.97,1681.713,1682.313,And C.O.A.S.T ..,32,,
242,0.97,1682.313,1693.825,"We have heard back from the director of S.E.E.D., who as many might know, many in the city hall environment might know took over as executive director of S.E.E.D.",32,,
243,0.97,1693.825,1695.427,In January.,32,,
244,0.97,1695.427,1699.564,"So come he has been in charge for almost a year, but the conditions have not changed at all.",32,,
245,0.97,1699.564,1702.233,They have not improved at all.,32,,
246,0.97,1702.233,1708.406,"So, we heard back from him asking if I could meet with him.",32,,
247,0.97,1708.406,1723.588,"My office has responded to him saying that of course I will, but I'm not going to meet with him privately, but alongside tenants from the Ranier court buildings who after years of being thoroughly ignored should surely be given the chance to voice their grievances to S.E.E.D.",32,,
248,0.97,1723.588,1723.955,Directly.,32,,
249,0.97,1723.955,1728.827,We have offered him two different times where he can give a response.,32,,
250,0.97,1728.827,1732.33,I'm hoping that we are able to meet with him as soon as possible with the tenants.,32,,
251,0.97,1732.33,1741.339,"Friday night my office organized and absolutely, what turned out to be absolutely an electric meeting with the tenants of Ranier court.",32,,
252,0.97,1741.339,1746.177,"With at least 75 tenants, any family members, children, participating.",32,,
253,0.97,1746.177,1751.783,Along with the tenants' Union and Seattle.,32,,
254,0.97,1751.783,1758.189,"As Councilmember Morales mentioned, she attended for part of the meeting and I appreciate her joining us.",32,,
255,0.97,1758.189,1768.7,I really wanted to thank the community organizers and Socialists in my office who have spent hours on many days in the last week and a half organizing with the tenants.,32,,
256,0.97,1768.7,1782.714,"These courageous Renters are ready to fight, and they see the importance of not only joining together to fight back against the abuses of their landlord and their property manager, but to follow that up to also build a movement for rent control.",32,,
257,0.97,1782.714,1799.03,"Now, this kind of organizing does put pressure on people in power, and so the tenants are informing us that they have heard initial Murmurs from C.O.A.S.T., the property manager, about fixing the code violations, which is very important.",32,,
258,0.97,1799.03,1805.436,It's a Testament to the tenants getting organized and not being isolated.,32,,
259,0.97,1805.436,1808.706,"As individual tenants, but coming together, hundreds of tenants.",32,,
260,0.97,1808.706,1823.855,"But, the tenants also made it very clear at the Friday night meeting that while they want the housing code violations to be fixed, of course, but they are correctly outraged at the rent increases and they are not going to accept anything short of their rent increases being rescinded.",32,,
261,0.97,1823.855,1837.669,"At the Friday night meeting, they have signed the--signed a letter to--that is addressed to S.E.E.D.",32,,
262,0.97,1837.669,1850.381,"And C.O.A.S.T., and to local affected officials where they are listing their demand and urging support from progressive elected officials both on the city Council, but also in the King County Council and the state Legislature.",32,,
263,0.97,1850.381,1852.684,We will be circulating that letter once we get more signatures.,32,,
264,0.97,1852.684,1862.193,"We want to make sure that we are each--many of the tenants who weren't able to attend Friday night, but they have signed the petition for the demands as a whole.",32,,
265,0.97,1862.193,1876.474,"Moving on, on today's introduction and referral calendar is the legislation from my office requiring construction bosses to reimburse workers for the cost of parking that are currently paid by workers.",32,,
266,0.97,1876.474,1879.01,Which is nothing short of requiring workers to pay to go to work.,32,,
267,0.97,1879.01,1895.426,"Councilmembers will have received hundreds of Emails from construction workers and other working-class people in solidarity with construction workers, expressing outrage that no Councilmember was willing to second my motion two weeks ago to introduce the bill.",32,,
268,0.97,1895.426,1898.196,Its introduction today shows the impact of that grassroots activism.,32,,
269,0.97,1898.196,1904.035,On today's introduction and referral calendar the bill has been referred to the Finance and housing committee.,32,,
270,0.97,1904.035,1913.044,My office has inquired with Councilmember Mosqueda's office about which meeting it will be discussed in.,32,,
271,0.97,1913.044,1915.847,I understand that a date has not been chosen yet.,32,,
272,0.97,1915.847,1931.062,"As I have offered in the past, if Councilmembers are unwilling to vote on this legislation as a full city Council, during budget, I'm happy to make space for it at the November 30th meeting of the Sustainability and Renters' rights Committee, which I chair.",32,,
273,0.97,1931.062,1949.847,"Before moving to the Finance and housing Committee is also okay as long as it will be scheduled on the agenda before the end of 2021 at the end of the year all new Council committees are formed, and I do not think that the support workers rights legislation should be referred to a committee that will cease to exist before having a chance to vote.",32,,
274,0.97,1949.847,1957.789,"Most importantly, I do not agree with moves by elected officials which are aimed to dull the momentum of the struggle.",32,,
275,0.97,1957.789,1969.901,"Which obviously the struggle has momentum right now, especially following the courageous strike action by the carpenters and by construction workers speaking out two weeks ago in public comment.",32,,
276,0.97,1969.901,1977.709,"So, I am absolutely committed to making sure that the momentum that has been generated by workers fighting back and getting organized is not lost.",32,,
277,0.97,1977.709,1984.482,"So, I really urge the Council to make sure that we vote on this this year.",32,,
278,0.97,1984.482,1993.524,"As I said, it's fine to refer the bill to the Finance and housing Committee, as long as Councilmember Mosqueda will find time for it in her December meeting Agendas.",32,,
279,0.97,1993.524,2010.041,"If in the future it turns out that there will not be space for it, on her Finance and housing committee agenda, I again am happy to at that time refer into the Sustainability and Renters' rights committee.",32,,
280,0.97,2010.041,2027.358,"I--late last Friday, as Council President Gonzalez shared a few minutes ago, Mayor Durkan issued an emergency order to reinstate hiring bonuses of up to $25 for new police officers.",32,,
281,0.97,2027.358,2038.069,"Ironically, her excuse for this emergency order to get police even more money is the Covid-19 emergency.",32,,
282,0.97,2038.069,2049.981,"Her argument is that because so many police officers are endangering the public by refusing to be Vaccinated or wear masks, they need to give the police even more money.",32,,
283,0.97,2049.981,2057.288,"First, let's be clear about the double standard we are talking about when the Mayor advocates for hiring bonuses in the Seattle police Department.",32,,
284,0.97,2057.288,2061.392,The police are some of the most highest-paid workers among the city of Seattle employees.,32,,
285,0.97,2061.392,2066.998,Making more than double what is paid to social workers like homeless service workers.,32,,
286,0.97,2066.998,2083.514,"The Mayor has claimed that she could not use the funding for shelter and tiny House villages that ordinary people, by pushing back and being part of the people's budget, and also the solidarity budget.",32,,
287,0.97,2083.514,2095.526,They are not enough homeless service workers to staff new spaces where the hiring bonuses are just a way for the impoverished homeless service workers to actually help people turn their lives around.,32,,
288,0.97,2095.526,2102.5,We see the Mayor Lamenting the rate of attrition among police officers as she looked at the turnovers among turnovers.,32,,
289,0.97,2102.5,2104.735,Hello their pay is in relation to the services they provide.,32,,
290,0.97,2104.735,2109.04,Most of the social workers--social service workers to last a year.,32,,
291,0.97,2109.04,2114.946,It should not be a surprise that there is low morale among police officers.,32,,
292,0.97,2114.946,2123.921,"Over the last year we saw the murder of George Floyd, we saw the Seattle police filling our communities with tear gas, and spraying with children in the face.",32,,
293,0.97,2123.921,2128.059,Running over protesters' heads with bicycles.,32,,
294,0.97,2128.059,2138.269,All of that in addition to the usual levels of violence done to people of color and especially low income people and our neighbors by repressive policing.,32,,
295,0.97,2138.269,2143.374,Of course there is low morale among police officers when so many ordinary people are correctly outraged by the harm the police to.,32,,
296,0.97,2143.374,2158.756,"The solution is not to pretend that those problems do not exist, but and that the justifiable outrage does not exist, the solution is for officer to be a held accountable for their wrongdoing.",32,,
297,0.97,2158.756,2177.108,We have the police Department--continuing to use the police contract as an excuse for failing to hold--we have the political establishment continuing to use the police contract as an excuse for failing to hold officers accountable.,32,,
298,0.97,2177.108,2191.088,"Yet, here we are in the middle of contract negotiations with the Seattle police officers Guild, and the Mayor is offering the police extra money, without an agreement on accountability in the new contract, without even an agreement to be Vaccinated like every other city of Seattle worker.",32,,
299,0.97,2191.088,2198.796,These are not the actions of elected officials who want to increase police accountability.,32,,
300,0.97,2198.796,2208.039,They are the actions of a political establishment that has spent the last several years attempting to manufacture a cultural fear to distract from their abject refusal to address the housing and homelessness crisis.,32,,
301,0.97,2208.039,2220.751,My office has requested the city council central staff this morning to prepare the legislation to reject this emergency order to give large hiring bonuses for police officers.,32,,
302,0.97,2220.751,2236.067,"Obviously if other Councilmembers bring similar legislation I would be happy to vote on that instead, but in my view this emergency order is a terrible misuse of city resources that should be used for affordable housing, social services, and investing in our communities.",32,,
303,0.97,2236.067,2237.468,Thank you.,32,,
304,0.97,2237.468,2242.44,Thank you.,33,,

399,0.97,2774.004,2777.708,Opportunities for Council next steps.,38,,
400,0.97,2777.708,2793.29,"I want to note that while the Mayor proposed hiring bonuses for police officers in the budget, she did not include hiring bonuses for 911 call Dispatchers, as is proposed in this particular emergency order.",38,,
401,0.97,2793.29,2812.042,"The shortage of 911 Dispatchers at the community safety and communications center is an issue that I identify in my budget amendment, the Mayor's proposed budget, as part of an effort to study whether or not hiring bonuses make sense for other positions in the city.",38,,
402,0.97,2812.042,2819.55,"On numerous occasions I specifically called out the need, as I understood it, for 911 Dispatchers.",38,,
403,0.97,2819.55,2829.459,Those interested should check the municipal code governs the proclamation of a civil emergency.,38,,
404,0.97,2829.459,2831.562,Noting that as a point of reference to the listening public.,38,,
405,0.97,2831.562,2835.866,I also want to highlight dollar figures.,38,,
406,0.97,2835.866,2851.181,"That would be necessary to fund the Mayor's proposal, are different from what was included in the Mayor's proposed budget for bonuses for police officers . over a budget we just received a month ago.",38,,
407,0.97,2851.181,2862.192,"The proposal released in late September, budget proposal, put it up to $7500 for new hires, and 1500 for lateral hires.",38,,
408,0.97,2862.192,2870.801,"This new proposed emergency order provides up to [Indiscernible] and up to $20,000 for new hires.",38,,
409,0.97,2870.801,2877.407,What was proposed in the 2022 budget is $1.09 million.,38,,
410,0.97,2877.407,2902.332,"Meaning the inclusion of the increase of the cost of the bonus for both lateral hires and new hires, and adding the funding for bonuses for 911 call takers, means that the Mayor's own proposed budget falls far short of the likely cost of her proposed 2022 budget program.",38,,
411,0.97,2902.332,2915.045,It's not clear whether or not funding in the 2021 budget is sufficient to allow the program to begin operating as envisioned.,38,,
412,0.97,2915.045,2932.429,Although I do recognize at Council last--$1 million in the SPD budget . We just recently made the midyear budget adjustment.,38,,
413,0.97,2932.429,2934.264,I guess that will teach us to do that.,38,,
414,0.97,2934.264,2941.271,[Laughter] when asked to allow for some flexibility in the Department budget.,38,,
415,0.97,2941.271,2947.978,I really feel like we should be dealing with this issue as part of the budget process.,38,,
416,0.97,2947.978,2952.082,I stated as much a couple months ago.,38,,
417,0.97,2952.082,2954.251,And hope that that's how we move forward.,38,,
418,0.97,2954.251,2967.864,"So, in essence, this emergency order wouldn't actually amend the 2021 budget, but without sufficient funds source identified by the Mayor for her own program.",38,,
419,0.97,2967.864,2977.074,"So, want to lay out that in considering 2021 funds in SPD for the salary budget, there were some that were not needed.",38,,
420,0.97,2977.074,2989.119,"The Council left about $1 million, and then as it relates to the CSC see, whether or not there is sufficient funding in the 2021 budget now.",38,,
421,0.97,2989.119,3005.335,"That is something I think we need to take a little bit of a more careful look at as we move forward to consider whether or not we intend to amend, reject or accept this emergency order.",38,,
422,0.97,3005.335,3012.142,Was a vacancy rate assumed in the Cscc 2021 budget?,38,,
423,0.97,3012.142,3014.845,And that vacancy rate was about 15%.,38,,
424,0.97,3014.845,3027.157,"That is less, I'm sorry that--yes, that vacancy rate is less than what I understand the Cscc is experiencing right now, but it is possible that there may be funds there.",38,,
425,0.97,3027.157,3035.065,"Again, whether or not there are existing funds in the 2021 budget, is one of the issues that I think we need to consider.",38,,
426,0.97,3035.065,3048.578,Whether or not there are sufficient funds in the 2022 budget to fund the Mayor's executive order is something that I feel that we should be discussing within the context of the 2022 budget.,38,,
427,0.97,3048.578,3054.451,Rather than as it relates to this executive order.,38,,
428,0.97,3054.451,3062.392,"So, that is sort of where I'm at and happy to take any questions that folks might have.",38,,
429,0.97,3062.392,3080.41,"And gift wrapping up here, want to just make note that an item coming up this week, I do have a very--criminal Eag meeting on Thursday evening.",38,,
430,0.97,3080.41,3112.008,"I know a lot of folks who live in the very neighborhoods have a lot of concerns and interest in the proposed changes, and will be looking forward to attending that meeting and hearing more both from the community as well as from the Washington state fairies and their proposal.",38,,
431,0.97,3112.008,3122.652,"And then, just closing out, I do have a proclamation that will be shared . It's a proclamation for family Caregivers support month.",38,,
432,0.97,3122.652,3139.669,"November is family Caregiver support month, and in recognition we have been working with the human services Department's division to bring forward a proclamation recognizing it as family Caregiver support month.",38,,
433,0.97,3139.669,3154.784,"The Mayor is Concurring, and just as a little bit of background, Washington State Department of social and health services estimates that there Ae 200,000 unpaid Caregivers these are people who help.",38,,
434,0.97,3154.784,3161.558,Someone age 18 or older who needs regular care to remain at home rather than moving to a care facility.,38,,
435,0.97,3161.558,3168.298,"This proclamation recognizing family Caregivers as contributors, to the strength of families and communities.",38,,

442,0.97,3201.431,3210.106,I do want to note that Councilmember Mosqueda of course I had to leave at about 10:20 for a Council budget related meeting.,39,,
443,0.97,3210.106,3220.45,"So, she will be asked if she would like to affix her signature to the proclamation during this afternoon's full council meeting.",39,,

557,0.97,3820.583,3832.094,You would think that after all this that things would change and some things just don't change.,60,,
558,0.97,3832.094,3838.668,So I'm hoping that I could share that with you colleagues because I think you know how I feel about those issues.,60,,
559,0.97,3838.668,3844.54,I often don't say a lot politically about some things because sometimes I don't believe it is my place.,60,,
