26,0.97,273.239,278.311,Our police have repeatedly shown an inability to hold themselves accountable.,1,,
27,0.97,278.311,286.252,City Council must be the ones who hold them accountable to your power over the budget.,1,,
28,0.97,286.252,287.887,Or the atrocities will continue.,1,,
29,0.97,287.887,290.256,Spd has already killed two people this year.,1,,
30,0.97,290.256,299.632,"They have shown a willingness and eagerness to Brutalize peaceful protesters, violating our first amendment rights.",1,,

41,0.97,336.536,337.37,Good morning.,3,,
42,0.97,337.37,344.243,Cpc and the Council continue a pattern of Performative accountability from the community reality.,3,,
43,0.97,344.243,354.754,Just two weeks ago the CPC voted against supporting full civilization of police investigations contrary to the overwhelming community input.,3,,
44,0.97,354.754,356.956,Contrary to the current legislation in Olympia.,3,,
45,0.97,356.956,365.398,Contrary to the recommendations from the governor's task force on independent investigations of police and contrary to common sense.,3,,
46,0.97,365.398,371.938,Cpc appointments only further highlight the degree to which the Council and the Commission are cut off from the community.,3,,
47,0.97,371.938,379.011,The Federal Court memorandum of understanding specifically calls out the importance of student and youth membership on the CPC.,3,,
48,0.97,379.011,389.789,Today's six appointments continue a pattern of excluding youth voices with all appointees being over 30 and having an average age of over 41.,3,,
49,0.97,389.789,399.132,"The newest CPC appointed Commissioner said to the people of views by the SPC last summer who were providing testimony about their abuse quote, I don't have pity or sympathy.",3,,
50,0.97,399.132,400.767,They are whining about this and that.,3,,
51,0.97,400.767,406.773,You knew it was going to be violent like that because you came out with that agenda.,3,,
52,0.97,406.773,410.109,Thereby blaming the victims for their Abus.,3,,
53,0.97,410.109,417.116,It should be noted while Victoria Beach was accepted as a new Commissioner a Protester who applied to be a Commissioner was rejected.,3,,
54,0.97,417.116,431.898,In fact over the last eight years there has never been a Protester on the CPC nor has there been a young person.,3,,
55,0.97,431.898,432.732,Thank you.,4,,
56,0.97,432.732,437.904,The next Speaker is Angie followed by Sean.,4,,

58,0.97,447.947,456.022,The team of unarmed officers is a new form of public safety Resourcing that has wide community support and has been fully supported in recent years.,5,,
59,0.97,456.022,467.133,After years of investment into planning and implementation as of last fall the team of Multilingual diverse staff have suddenly not been able to scale up as allocated.,5,,
60,0.97,467.133,472.305,There is immense demand for their services and it's hampering their ability to conduct needed training.,5,,
61,0.97,472.305,476.576,The politics of Defunding have frozen this program for many months.,5,,
62,0.97,476.576,490.256,I believe because of the optics of it being housed within the police Department the civilian CSO staff who have worked hard to define and implement the program have stated they do not want to leave the Department.,5,,
63,0.97,490.256,491.991,Don't let this viable program stagnate.,5,,
64,0.97,491.991,499.098,It is ready to immediately scale up in a community sensitive way using previously allocated positions.,5,,
65,0.97,499.098,503.769,Seattle needs help responding to a wider range of 911 calls and other community support.,5,,

78,0.97,563.829,566.832,These funds should be allocated to supportive budgeting.,7,,
79,0.97,566.832,580.546,Personally I'm disappointed we are back here again after city council unanimously passed resolution 31962 which stated city council would not grant official funding for excess overtime.,7,,
80,0.97,580.546,587.687,Especially disappointing given the investigations have concluded inappropriate SPD overtime pay over years.,7,,
81,0.97,587.687,604.604,City Council needs to honor its commitments and hold SPD accountable by reducing the 2021 budget by the full 5.4 million and transfer the funds to Participatory budgeting which is driven by community need.,7,,

93,0.97,665.965,670.136,Spd has a huge history of overspending with their overtime.,12,,
94,0.97,670.136,675.975,This money can be used to help the black community which they Brutalize.,12,,
95,0.97,675.975,687.953,I want to make sure that SPD does not continue to use this overtime funds for their gain but to get this into the community's hands.,12,,
96,0.97,687.953,693.559,I want to make sure the city council honors what they passed last summer.,12,,
97,0.97,693.559,700.499,It's really important that the funds get to the community because this is the people that need it the most.,12,,
98,0.97,700.499,711.277,We need to hold SPD accountable reducing the 2021 budget and transferring those funds to Participatory budgeting.,12,,
99,0.97,711.277,714.213,I'm asking that the city council do what they said they were going to do.,12,,
100,0.97,714.213,721.854,"I ask that the city council remain on the side of the public, to be on the side of the people that SPD Brutalizes.",12,,
101,0.97,721.854,726.892,"And again, please put this money back into the hands of the people.",12,,
102,0.97,726.892,732.531,Not to the SPD officers which they Brutalize the black community.,12,,

106,0.97,742.374,742.675,Hello.,14,,

108,0.97,745.244,757.49,I'm calling to ask Council to pass CB 11981 without amendment and reduce the Seattlepolice Department's 2021 budget by the full $5.4 million that SPD Overspent in 2020.,14,,
109,0.97,757.49,762.128,These funds need to go to Participatory budgeting.,14,,
110,0.97,762.128,771.137,Council members have talked about being concerned that reducing SPD's 2021 budget could create issues with SPD's compliance with the consent decree.,14,,
111,0.97,771.137,775.407,Spd is not and never has been in compliance with the consent decree.,14,,
112,0.97,775.407,785.217,Spd has over eight years to bring itself into compliance Úand has failed to do so Despit a skyrocketing budget that has grown by over 60%.,14,,
113,0.97,785.217,801.534,Spd's 2021 budget is more than $100 million higher than it was when Seattle entered into the consent decree in 2012 and will remain over $100 million higher even after the 5.4 million is reallocated.,14,,
114,0.97,801.534,807.673,Clearly the budget is not what's keeping SPD from complying with the consent decree.,14,,
115,0.97,807.673,819.018,Consistently found SPD to be out of compliance in areas of account.,14,,
116,0.97,819.018,836.802,City Council needs to honor resolution and hold SPD accountable for its spending by transferring the full 5.4 million Overspent in 2020 from SPD to Participatory budgeting.,14,,
117,0.97,836.802,838.437,Thank you.,14,,
118,0.97,838.437,839.305,Thank you.,15,,
119,0.97,839.305,845.344,Next Speaker is Andy followed by Calum.,15,,
120,0.97,845.344,845.811,Hi there.,16,,
121,0.97,845.811,851.55,I'm a district three resident and a member of the Washington state nurse's Association.,16,,
122,0.97,851.55,862.261,I'm calling to ask city Council to pass CB without amendments and reduce the Seattle police Department's 2021 budget by the full 5.4 million they Overspent in 2020.,16,,
123,0.97,862.261,866.599,These funds should be allocated to Participatory budgeting.,16,,
124,0.97,866.599,870.836,Spd has a history of overtime fraud.,16,,
125,0.97,870.836,874.94,They continue to support the overtime budget fiscally irresponsible by the Council.,16,,
126,0.97,874.94,879.745,They do not deserve special treatment compared to other departments.,16,,
127,0.97,879.745,886.852,5.4Million is a ton of money that could vastly improve other services in the city through Participatory budgeting.,16,,
128,0.97,886.852,892.524,Already this year they have killed two members of our community for mental health issues.,16,,
129,0.97,892.524,903.002,"As someone who has worked in the mental health sector, these deaths were not necessary.",16,,
130,0.97,903.002,905.904,Last year this Council made a commitment to Defund this Department.,16,,
131,0.97,905.904,909.208,Now is the time to take action.,16,,
132,0.97,909.208,915.481,So please honor your commitments and hold SPD accountable.,16,,
133,0.97,915.481,921.754,Full 5.4 million and transferring the found to Participatory budgeting.,16,,

138,0.97,939.238,940.539,My name is Julia Buck.,18,,
139,0.97,940.539,942.041,I'm a resident of district six.,18,,
140,0.97,942.041,950.182,I'm calling to ask city Council to please pass CB 119981 without amendments.,18,,
141,0.97,950.182,956.188,I'd also like to ask that these funds be allocated to Participatory budgeting.,18,,
142,0.97,956.188,971.103,You know the job of our Mayor and city council is--the job of every city Department is to spend within the bounds of what our city Council has allocated to them.,18,,
143,0.97,971.103,995.728,It's very worrying to me to hear this Department--we need to live within our budgets.,18,,
144,0.97,996.962,1009.408,"Sorry, I'm having a hard time hearing you.",19,,
145,0.97,1009.408,1013.812,Referred to cutting the 2021 budget as how we hold the line.,20,,
146,0.97,1013.812,1021.22,I encourage city Council to please hold the line.,20,,
147,0.97,1021.22,1023.222,Thank you.,20,,
148,0.97,1023.222,1026.658,Thank you.,21,,
149,0.97,1026.658,1034.533,Our next Speaker is let's see Alice followed by Alex.,21,,
150,0.97,1034.533,1034.8,Hi.,22,,
151,0.97,1034.8,1035.234,Good morning.,22,,
152,0.97,1035.234,1041.874,I live in Mount Baker and I'm calling in support of passing CB 119981 without amendment.,22,,
153,0.97,1041.874,1049.515,Both parts of this bill are really important transferring the money out of SPD and transferring it to Participatory budgeting.,22,,
154,0.97,1049.515,1053.185,It's important it be the full 5.4 million.,22,,
155,0.97,1053.185,1060.426,When SPD Overspent last year you let them have this money with the clear understanding they were borrowing that money from their own funds for 2021.,22,,
156,0.97,1060.426,1064.663,Now they're asking you to forgive the debt and pretend it didn't happen.,22,,
157,0.97,1064.663,1067.666,Talking about money that SPD never had any right to claim.,22,,
158,0.97,1067.666,1079.144,"Because they were borrowing from their own future funds, granting SPD's request would mean that Council is going to pay now out of its own pocket to cover last year's overspending.",22,,
159,0.97,1079.144,1083.682,That puts you in a rare position where you have are the power of hindsight.,22,,
160,0.97,1083.682,1087.086,Usually when you budget you're putting down money for outcomes in the future.,22,,
161,0.97,1087.086,1092.291,In this case we'd be paying for the past and we know exactly what this amount of money produced.,22,,
162,0.97,1092.291,1099.097,It it was used to pay for excessive amounts of overtime so police could Brutalize protesters.,22,,
163,0.97,1099.097,1106.004,We saw police in riot gear pepper spraying and tear gassing people.,22,,
164,0.97,1106.004,1113.378,It would be unconscionable to decide to pay the police Department any amount of money for last summer.,22,,
165,0.97,1113.378,1116.048,This is a fantastic chance to invest in Participatory budgeting.,22,,
166,0.97,1116.048,1117.649,This is only one facet of the work.,22,,
167,0.97,1117.649,1121.587,We have a beautiful opportunity to create true public safety in Seattle right now.,22,,
168,0.97,1121.587,1128.26,I urge you to please pass this bill without amendment.,22,,
169,0.97,1128.26,1131.063,Thank you for your time.,22,,
170,0.97,1131.063,1133.432,Thank you.,23,,

175,0.97,1148.413,1149.982,I live in U district.,24,,
176,0.97,1149.982,1165.631,I'm calling to ask city Council to pass Cb119981 without amendment and to reduce the 2021 budget by the full 5.4 million that SPD themselves Overspent in 2020.,24,,
177,0.97,1165.631,1168.834,These found should absolutely be allocated to Participatory budgeting.,24,,
178,0.97,1168.834,1179.645,"Last year the city council Y'all unanimously passed resolution 31962 which stated city Council, Y'all, would not grant SPD additional funding.",24,,
179,0.97,1179.645,1188.587,"Spd Overspent on overtime, asked for additional funding and city council granted it while pledging to reduce the 2021 budget.",24,,
180,0.97,1188.587,1200.365,"City Downsy, Y'all, needs to honor its commitments and hold SPD accountable by reducing the budget by the full 5.4 million and transferring the funds to Participatory budgeting.",24,,
181,0.97,1200.365,1211.476,The job of the Mayor and every city Department is to spend within the bounds of what city council allocates.,24,,
182,0.97,1211.476,1214.379,Spd should not receive special treatment.,24,,
183,0.97,1214.379,1223.021,"Shows SPD Council is serious, shows SPD the city council is serious about budget accountability.",24,,
184,0.97,1223.021,1223.322,Thank you.,24,,
185,0.97,1223.322,1227.993,I see one Speaker who was not present earlier is present now.,25,,

191,0.97,1245.877,1259.024,I'm a resident of district 4 Council member Alex Pedersen I'm calling in to strongly support CB 119981 to reduce the SPD budget by 5.4 million.,27,,
192,0.97,1259.024,1265.797,Spd has a well documented history of abusing overtime to the detriment of our city budget.,27,,
193,0.97,1265.797,1280.579,"This summer SPD used overtime extensively to bully and police black lives matter protesters, even at one point maintaining a 24 hour presence in blocks in capital Hill, completely unnecessarily for multiple days.",27,,
194,0.97,1280.579,1288.086,On other years there is well documented evidence that overtime fraud by SPD employees that clearly hasn't been put in check.,27,,
195,0.97,1288.086,1293.592,These funds would not actually go to places that support public safety as is right now.,27,,
196,0.97,1293.592,1304.569,So they should be put into processes that might actually help through things like Participatory budgeting.,27,,
197,0.97,1304.569,1304.87,Thank you.,27,,
198,0.97,1304.87,1307.873,I yield my time.,27,,

200,0.97,1308.74,1316.248,Our next Speaker is Alex Bryant.,28,,
201,0.97,1316.248,1316.481,Hi.,29,,
202,0.97,1316.481,1324.423,"I'm calling to state that Seattle city council needs to reinvest in the community, not the police force which has proven itself to be a danger to the community at large.",29,,
203,0.97,1324.423,1334.366,The idea that Seattle city council would pay $5.4 million in overtime hours for a police force which wages war on the city is absurd.,29,,
204,0.97,1334.366,1354.252,"5.4Million in compensation for time spent throwing flash grenades at citizens, smoke bombing neighborhoods and arresting those who were nonviolent and practicing their constitutional right to protest an unjust and inhumane system R owe city has a need to reinvest in Community-Based organizations and those with the skill set to work with the chronically homeless.",29,,
205,0.97,1354.252,1357.355,Including those with severe mental health.,29,,
206,0.97,1357.355,1362.427,Spd has proven itself incapable and inadequate when it comes to providing safety for our community.,29,,
207,0.97,1362.427,1371.369,As a manager of a high Acue tiny House village I've had calls with SPD.,29,,
208,0.97,1371.369,1377.542,Attempted to triage safety concerns and been met with little to no assistance other than the suggestion to arrest clients in crisis.,29,,
209,0.97,1377.542,1385.984,I've had firsthand experience in consulting with SPD for working with those in crises and been told toe strict them as a solution.,29,,
210,0.97,1385.984,1391.39,Evicting someone is not only cruel but unethical given the current public health crises we are experiencing.,29,,
211,0.97,1391.39,1396.361,The city is relying on SPD to do a job they are unfit and unwilling to do in a myriad of ways.,29,,
212,0.97,1396.361,1422.02,This is of course to no surprise because their sole purpose is to arrest and incarcerate those in crises instead of engaging in Nonpunitive measures.,29,,
213,0.97,1439.771,1440.205,My apologies.,30,,
214,0.97,1440.205,1443.975,My Internet is unstable this morning.,30,,

219,0.97,1455.854,1469.634,The city council must pass CB 119981 without the amendment and Reallocate the 5.4 million that SPD Overspent on overtime in 2020 to Participatory budgeting.,31,,
220,0.97,1469.634,1472.571,Spd shouldn't receive special treatment.,31,,
221,0.97,1472.571,1473.638,They must be held accountable.,31,,
222,0.97,1473.638,1488.386,Spd learns they can get a free pass to freely Overspend on overtime and use those funds it to violently suppress peaceful demonstrators protesting in defense of black lives as they did last summer they will do so again.,31,,
223,0.97,1488.386,1498.33,This kind of overtime spending is not only a waste of resources but also actively hurts Seattle's black communities who have suffered at the hands of SPD for decades.,31,,
224,0.97,1498.33,1504.469,The 5.4 million that SPD spent on overtime should go into Participatory budgeting.,31,,
225,0.97,1504.469,1515.881,Seattle must not reward SPD for their unconstitutional behavior and instead invest in a more democratic you Mispal budgeting process.,31,,
226,0.97,1515.881,1517.415,Thank you.,32,,
227,0.97,1517.415,1525.624,The next Speaker that we have present is Ben.,32,,

237,0.97,1553.118,1558.189,I've not taken part in any demonstration but identify been an unwilling bystander of the police's actions.,33,,
238,0.97,1558.189,1565.063,Not even a month after moving in I had to vacate my animals and myself because tear gas had filled every room.,33,,
239,0.97,1565.063,1567.699,Despite tear gas being banned by the city.,33,,
240,0.97,1567.699,1577.342,Police tried to force themselves into my apartment complex to Interrogate my neighbors after one neighbor yelled out the window for the police to go home.,33,,
241,0.97,1577.342,1585.684,Right after Christmas I was nearly arrested for walking my dog while Seattle police were Brutalizing homeless folks and clearing them out of the park.,33,,
242,0.97,1585.684,1592.857,Instead the police have built a figurative and literal barricade between themselves and the community.,33,,
243,0.97,1592.857,1598.029,I've never seen any police try to talk or work with any members of my community.,33,,
244,0.97,1598.029,1604.636,Our apartment has formed a coalition to deal with crime because we cannot rely on police to do anything but harass us.,33,,

282,0.97,1857.355,1867.232,At the same time you made a commitment to the people of Seattle to Defund SPD by 50% at least as we asked and didn't uphold your word to us.,42,,
283,0.97,1867.232,1874.072,Spd has ignored active race calls because they're too busy monitoring and Brutalizing protesters.,42,,

424,0.97,2667.264,2668.065,Good morning.,63,,
425,0.97,2668.065,2669.8,My name is Tascha Johnson.,64,,
426,0.97,2669.8,2672.036,I'm a resident of Renton Highlands.,64,,
427,0.97,2672.036,2674.271,I want to thank you for this opportunity as well.,64,,
428,0.97,2674.271,2687.851,I've had several family members that have been affected personally by the criminal legal system and by use of excess force which is what prompted my interest in the CPC.,64,,
429,0.97,2687.851,2691.989,When I decided to return to academia as a Nontraditional student.,64,,
430,0.97,2691.989,2693.223,I returned later in life.,64,,
431,0.97,2693.223,2703.4,My original interests were in areas of juvenile education and reaching higher levels of higher education.,64,,
432,0.97,2703.4,2719.516,However upon my introduction to choose 180 I realized there's a large segment of the population that will never have this opportunity or may never have this opportunity if their juvenile behaviors are Criminalized.,64,,
433,0.97,2719.516,2726.457,"I too am a young person, Okay, like everyone else said, I'm not really a young person any more, but that was my history.",64,,
434,0.97,2726.457,2732.529,So as a young person my behaviors were not Criminalized.,64,,
435,0.97,2732.529,2738.836,I somehow managed to escape that part of the police force.,64,,
436,0.97,2738.836,2768.465,"However, I still have a lot of, I know a lot of people that have been affected by the excess use of policing and would really benefit from being able to collaborate and understand how to work within systems and that the police really are not against you but learning how to bring these communities together.",64,,
437,0.97,2768.465,2775.939,And if we stunt these youth before they even get started that will hamper their futures.,64,,
438,0.97,2775.939,2780.677,That basically States my interest wanting to with the CPC.,64,,
439,0.97,2780.677,2790.187,I'm hoping to bring our communities together so the police are not seen as the enemy.,64,,
440,0.97,2790.187,2790.554,Thank you.,65,,
441,0.97,2790.554,2791.088,And then Reverend Hunter.,65,,
442,0.97,2791.088,2798.262,Thank you so much for the opportunity to come before you this morning and I am Reverend Patricia Hunter.,66,,
443,0.97,2798.262,2815.279,I live on North beacon Hill and as mentioned in my introduction that I serve two congregations on capital Hill that have deep roots in social justice as well as advocating for police accountability.,66,,
444,0.97,2815.279,2816.58,I was born in Seattle.,66,,
445,0.97,2816.58,2825.155,And I have watched the city grow and expand and in some ways deteriorate over the past 25 years.,66,,
446,0.97,2825.155,2835.065,I've also watched the credibility and the accountability and honor of the Seattle police ebb and flow over that same period of time.,66,,
447,0.97,2835.065,2846.61,"I'm supportive of Seattle police, we need the Seattle police and one of my Ministry colleagues is retired Seattle police chief.",66,,
448,0.97,2846.61,2854.451,But I also need to hold the Seattle police accountable for their Missteps and their misconduct.,66,,
449,0.97,2854.451,2871.768,"And I certainly watched the s, SPD as others did last summer act in questionable ways during the protests, marches and where peaceful people were exercising their first amendment rights.",66,,
450,0.97,2871.768,2883.513,So by serving on the community police Commission is one way that I can do my part in holding SPD accountable for their actions.,66,,
451,0.97,2883.513,2887.351,I do not even claim to try and be a young person.,66,,
452,0.97,2887.351,2892.289,"I am an African-American older Lesbian, very proud of that.",66,,
453,0.97,2892.289,2901.665,And I am very concerned about police actions in marginalized communities that I represent.,66,,
454,0.97,2901.665,2906.203,I'm concerned about how police interact with those with mental health needs.,66,,
455,0.97,2906.203,2919.216,It's common knowledge that officers are ill equipped to Deescalate situations where there are mental health issues.,66,,
456,0.97,2919.216,2924.755,So John T. Williams reasons why I would like to serve on this Commission.,66,,
457,0.97,2924.755,2927.491,I'm also an advocate for community engagement.,66,,
458,0.97,2927.491,2933.53,I want neighbors to get the officers who work in their area and their part of town.,66,,
459,0.97,2933.53,2947.144,I want to see officers at community celebrations and August night out events and greater respect and perhaps even some trust can grow with greater community engagement and accountability.,66,,
460,0.97,2947.144,2953.083,So those are just a few of the reasons why I would like to serve on the Commission.,66,,
461,0.97,2953.083,2953.383,Thank you.,66,,
462,0.97,2953.383,2954.651,Thank you so much.,67,,

464,0.97,2962.359,2962.826,Good morning.,68,,
465,0.97,2962.826,2967.564,I was going to say good afternoon and it is not afternoon yet.,68,,
466,0.97,2967.564,2976.473,But my pleasure to present the Mayor's reappointment to the community police Commission Asha Mohamed.,68,,
467,0.97,2976.473,2980.711,I don't know if Asha is on here.,68,,
468,0.97,2980.711,2982.245,She's rooted in community.,68,,

477,0.97,3030.66,3038.034,They're welcome to join us but the fact that Asha is not with us today is just fine.,69,,
478,0.97,3038.034,3043.774,And really pleased to have you with us deputy Mayor Washington.,69,,
479,0.97,3043.774,3057.154,"With that I want to thank everybody for their willingness to serve as mentioned this is a very, very important role to the city.",69,,
480,0.97,3057.154,3063.026,Particularly important at this time of inflection around issues of policing in our community.,69,,
481,0.97,3063.026,3078.241,Want to open it up to my colleagues to ask any questions they have of folks coming forward to serve.,69,,

484,0.97,3086.95,3101.765,This is also want to express gratitude to all of the folks who are willing to be considered for an appointment who have accepted their nomination for this really important Commission that has no shortage of work and responsibilities and duties.,70,,

486,0.97,3110.207,3110.941,I have one question.,70,,
487,0.97,3110.941,3118.482,I know we have a long agenda today so we don't have time to ask a lot of questions.,70,,
488,0.97,3118.482,3132.329,I'll just ask one that I think is really top of mind for me right now which is around labor negotiations as it relates to police Guilds.,70,,
489,0.97,3132.329,3169.599,"I wanted to hear sort of I suppose a thinking from each of the nominees how you plan to work within the context of the community police Commission and your responsibility to the communities you identify with and represent on issues related to the city's on going development of parameters within the respective police Guilds and on going negotiation issues, particularly as it relates to accountability and trust within the public safety system.",70,,
490,0.97,3169.599,3195.458,So just share with us a little bit about how you plan to show up and wrestle with those issues related to how accountability works or doesn't within the context of our labor negotiations process with police unions.,70,,
491,0.97,3195.458,3197.827,That's a question for everyone.,70,,
492,0.97,3197.827,3208.138,"Anyone can go, anyone who dares to go first is welcome to.",70,,
493,0.97,3208.138,3211.808,"Tough question, Council President.",71,,
494,0.97,3211.808,3212.309,"Yes, Tascha.",71,,
495,0.97,3212.309,3214.411,That is a tough question.,72,,
496,0.97,3214.411,3215.145,It's got me thinking.,72,,
497,0.97,3215.145,3249.646,"In my past I've worked with the Uscw local 21 as the Union steward for my store and in my position I was asked to take the concerns of our staff to the Union as it pertains to salaries and other policies, processes that were of concern to our staff.",72,,
498,0.97,3249.646,3279.909,Those skills and utilize those within the community that I live in now to bring those concerns to the CPC as well as to the community and currently in my position as the director of operations with choose 180 we have a lot of partnerships with community as in like the community of folks that live that we live amongst.,72,,
499,0.97,3279.909,3286.516,Juvenile detention centers we work with the King County prosecuting attorney's offices.,72,,
500,0.97,3286.516,3312.075,The partnerships we have span a large spectrum of folks and I believe I will be able to bring the community's together.,72,,
501,0.97,3312.075,3319.516,"Austin, Erica or Navin or Reverend Hunter?",73,,
502,0.97,3319.516,3319.849,Any thoughts?,73,,
503,0.97,3319.849,3320.116,Sure.,74,,
504,0.97,3320.116,3329.626,I think obviously that's going to be the most pressing issue that CPC faces over the next go around.,74,,
505,0.97,3329.626,3356.553,"Having done a little bit of research into police Union laws as part of legal Internships and scholarships that I've done, I think that there is a risk that public trust is undermined when the public discovers that collective bargaining agreements can subvert laws that are passed by peoples duly elected representatives.",74,,
506,0.97,3356.553,3377.474,"Sharing that information with folks, explaining the process and then taking people's concerns about that process especially, you know, the concerns of say students at the University of Washington or other places who may be less familiar with how the process works but once they learn how the process works are very concerned of that.",74,,
507,0.97,3377.474,3385.448,I see that as my role.,74,,
508,0.97,3385.448,3386.282,"Thank you, Austin.",75,,
509,0.97,3386.282,3386.683,Reverend Hunter.,75,,
510,0.97,3386.683,3396.793,I think that many of the communities that I represent are supportive of unions.,76,,
511,0.97,3396.793,3402.999,Would certainly respect the Seattle police officer's Guild.,76,,
512,0.97,3402.999,3416.479,But it's also important to have all Stakeholders at the table when negotiating these contracts and I would just not want to be bullied by the Guild.,76,,
513,0.97,3416.479,3428.258,And so for each stake holder to share when they feel is really important in the contract negotiations to hear and to listen but certainly not to be bullied by the Guild.,76,,
514,0.97,3428.258,3429.726,Thank you.,77,,
515,0.97,3429.726,3431.361,Navin or Erica?,77,,
516,0.97,3431.361,3431.694,Any thoughts?,77,,
517,0.97,3431.694,3433.997,"Yeah, I would--Oh, Erica.",78,,
518,0.97,3433.997,3434.23,Please.,78,,
519,0.97,3434.23,3434.764,"No, go ahead.",79,,
520,0.97,3434.764,3435.532,Go ahead.,79,,
521,0.97,3435.532,3450.079,I just wanted to echo comments that have been made that first of all I think that you know that Seattle police and the officer's Guild are accountable to the people they serve.,80,,
522,0.97,3450.079,3458.955,I knew that the Commission's role is to amplify the Voics of the people of the city of Seattle.,80,,
523,0.97,3458.955,3497.494,"I share Austin and comments that the more our public is aware of the mechanisms to which the officer's Guild has used collective bargaining to sort of undermine public sentiments and bully those to get their needs I think raising awareness of that and trying our best to, you know, have the Seattle police officer's Guild serve the community that they're entrusted to.",80,,
524,0.97,3497.494,3497.827,Thank you.,81,,
525,0.97,3497.827,3498.428,And Erica.,81,,
526,0.97,3498.428,3504.267,One of the things that come to my mind is communication and transparency is key.,82,,
527,0.97,3504.267,3513.109,"The reason being is because the Commission would, if we can explain to the public, you know, be transparent with the public.",82,,
528,0.97,3513.109,3524.587,"Communicate with them in a way they understand and be able to take that back, I guess you can use it as a tool to make people think in different perspectives.",82,,
529,0.97,3524.587,3541.538,"Those are the key words that come to my head in an attempt to reach agreements or deals, rules, et cetera, that are fair for both sides.",82,,
530,0.97,3541.538,3543.172,I think communication and transparency is big.,82,,
531,0.97,3543.172,3544.941,Thank you so much.,83,,
532,0.97,3544.941,3561.524,"I do want to recognize because I think the question raises the issue, the role that the CPC has played as it relates to preparing the Council and the Mayor in it developing bargaining parameters.",83,,
533,0.97,3561.524,3588.952,"The CPC in collaboration with the Mayor's office and the office, the labor relations office of the city has hosted a couple of different community engagement efforts both aimed at explaining to the public what the bargaining process is as well as sharing with the public the top priorities that the CPC has for bargaining parameters.",83,,
534,0.97,3588.952,3596.893,I want to thank the CPC for doing that work in conjunction with the Mayor's office and with labor relations.,83,,
535,0.97,3596.893,3604.4,That was always a prerequisite for the Council members that serve.,83,,
536,0.97,3604.4,3608.204,It was a prerequisite for us for beginning the discussions around bargaining parameters.,83,,
537,0.97,3608.204,3619.916,"We wanted to make sure that the CPC had sort of checked in with community not just about, you know, their understanding of the process moving forward.",83,,
538,0.97,3619.916,3634.263,We've got a lot of new people engaged in Watchdogging if you will the labor relations negotiations.,83,,
539,0.97,3634.263,3635.999,Then we did back in 2018.,83,,

572,0.97,3761.39,3780.042,Not typical as it relates to other appointments that we often see.,99,,
573,0.97,3780.042,3788.818,They run the process for identifying applicants and interviewing and bringing forward Finalists.,99,,

594,0.97,3939.068,3949.011,Definitely ensuring that the voices of the most impacted are heard in the discussion about policing and that community standards are brought forward.,100,,
595,0.97,3949.011,3959.422,Indeed she served as a Commission on the CPC and interim director and she is well poised to do amazing work as the executive director.,100,,
596,0.97,3959.422,3959.689,Yeah.,101,,
597,0.97,3959.689,3971.734,Since becoming interim executive director brandy has led the CPC during unprecedented times with police accountability being at the forefront.,101,,

624,0.97,4171.367,4198.027,"I want you to know if Appointd as the permanent executive director the type of leader that you will continue to have moving forward is someone who will be transparent, compassionate and hold community up and amplify the voices of people that have been extremely impacted by some unnecessary policing that we've had and we've seen and witnessed over a period of time.",103,,

638,0.97,4268.23,4273.535,I remember this is back in the day when we could be in the AME space together.,105,,
639,0.97,4273.535,4299.094,I remember you coming into my office at City Hall and sitting down with me to just talk about your interest in public safety and in police reform and accountability and one of the things I still remember about that conversation is how passionately you spoke about your own son.,105,,
640,0.97,4299.094,4309.672,And his own experiences as a young black man in this country with police and sort of your perspective as his mother.,105,,
641,0.97,4309.672,4323.752,I think you also in that moment not only spoke about the importance of holding police accountable and of the historic trauma caused by policing particularly within the black community.,105,,
642,0.97,4323.752,4338.233,You also spoke very eloquently about ant how important equitable community safety is.,105,,

653,0.97,4399.294,4411.407,I'm going to ask one question in the meantime while maybe others are considering whether or not they have any.,108,,
654,0.97,4411.407,4424.753,This Commission is unusual on city departments since you report to the Cochairs rather than having the Mayor as your direct report.,108,,
655,0.97,4424.753,4434.43,"Given that what priorities, what are your priorities as executive director and how do you work with the Co-Chairs to identify your priorities?",108,,
656,0.97,4434.43,4439.168,That's a really great question.,109,,
657,0.97,4439.168,4457.786,"Even though our office is set up differently, I think it's important to add that even though I primarily only report to Co-Chairs I am a servant of the Council, the Mayor's office, community, multiple different people.",109,,
658,0.97,4457.786,4461.657,I feel a responsibility to all those different entities.,109,,
659,0.97,4461.657,4466.862,I want to make sure I share that outwardly as well.,109,,
660,0.97,4466.862,4471.033,I have accountability for all of those systems.,109,,
661,0.97,4471.033,4472.167,I think that's helpful.,109,,
662,0.97,4472.167,4474.303,I have my feet held to the fire.,109,,
663,0.97,4474.303,4484.613,"For me most of my time here in Washington, three things that have stood out for me have been people, processes and policies.",109,,

667,0.97,4489.117,4497.192,You have to work on policies and systems that will help support those people that you are working for.,109,,
668,0.97,4497.192,4516.078,"Then the processes part comes down to from an organizational standpoint the CPC even though we've been around for the amount of time we have, there definitely has been a life cycle shift where we're in the process now of organizational restructure, development of Governance and strategic planning.",109,,
669,0.97,4516.078,4531.927,For the first 100 days in this position some of the things I would like to share with the community and with Council today is my primary focus is on an organizational restructure.,109,,
670,0.97,4531.927,4532.528,Increasing our bandwidth.,109,,
671,0.97,4532.528,4536.064,Making sure we build up our community engagement team.,109,,
672,0.97,4536.064,4549.077,Making sure we're hiring from within the community and giving folks not just an opportunity to have their experience be based on educational background Z. strip some of that away.,109,,
673,0.97,4549.077,4552.848,What they can add to and complement within our office.,109,,
674,0.97,4552.848,4556.752,Being more open minded about how we're hiring.,109,,
675,0.97,4556.752,4563.325,I have about maybe 10 priorities again.,109,,
676,0.97,4563.325,4566.261,Structuring the strategic planning processes coming up for us.,109,,
677,0.97,4566.261,4576.772,It will be the first time the police Commission has engaged in a planning process.,109,,
678,0.97,4576.772,4582.344,It will definitely require input from our Stakeholders and community.,109,,
679,0.97,4582.344,4592.621,"As I mentioned before we'll be doing a lot of, I'm going to be working to lead a lot of the CPC development around the Governance, orientation and structure.",109,,
680,0.97,4592.621,4599.928,It was a great question that Council President Gonzalez asked about how folks felt about the collective bargaining process.,109,,
681,0.97,4599.928,4608.937,"As someone who was formally a Commissioner, one of the things I recall the most was not feeling super confident about how to do this work.",109,,
682,0.97,4608.937,4627.489,So taking that experience and making sure that commissioners that come on from this day forward will have a really intentional specific and well rounded on boarding process so they can become familiar with the work we do.,109,,
683,0.97,4627.489,4629.625,We have some champions.,109,,
684,0.97,4629.625,4631.827,We were just introduced to some amazing folks.,109,,
685,0.97,4631.827,4637.399,It's about making sure that folks feel empowered to do said work.,109,,
686,0.97,4637.399,4640.268,And really stand up and represent for community.,109,,
687,0.97,4640.268,4645.674,Some of the other things are the District liaison implementation.,109,,
688,0.97,4645.674,4658.954,There's an integration process that I'm trying to develop now to make sure that commissioners were tapped in to the communities not only that we've been assigned to but the organic relationships we have within community.,109,,
689,0.97,4658.954,4664.126,I tell people there are organic relationships that I brought with me to the Commission.,109,,
690,0.97,4664.126,4668.764,That I felt was a really good fit for us to continue to engage with.,109,,
691,0.97,4668.764,4674.403,I want to see us do that more and be a little more intentional about that.,109,,
692,0.97,4674.403,4693.922,"There's some really great policy work, specific policy work I'll be overseeing and helping implement with the help of the full Commission and the amazing staff that I work with as Erin and La Rond have spoken to the recommendation of the dashboard.",109,,
693,0.97,4693.922,4709.738,"There's a professionalism project we're hopefully begin to work with SPD soon about and talk about are there ways where we can enhance conversations around officer wellness, how we hire, how we train people.",109,,
694,0.97,4709.738,4718.78,We've been having amazing conversations overseas with police in Canada and some of the take Aways that we got from those conversations were language and Semantics.,109,,
695,0.97,4718.78,4722.551,They don't believe in using the words law enforcement because of the context that comes with it.,109,,
696,0.97,4722.551,4729.357,They feel like they are peace officers.,109,,
697,0.97,4729.357,4732.127,Their hiring process for bringing on exemplary officers.,109,,
698,0.97,4732.127,4735.363,They do it from the outreach process to the day they retire.,109,,
699,0.97,4735.363,4736.865,You know what I mean?,109,,
700,0.97,4736.865,4738.433,They're taking care of families.,109,,
701,0.97,4738.433,4746.608,"Putting systems in place where people are having mental health evaluations and they're honestly not asking, they are peace officers.",109,,
702,0.97,4746.608,4753.648,"Aka our law enforcement, to do jobs that are not within their power to do.",109,,
703,0.97,4753.648,4753.882,Right?,109,,
704,0.97,4753.882,4756.852,So just being able to strip away some of those things.,109,,
705,0.97,4756.852,4766.294,The language and the Semantics of everything regarding dismantling and Defunding and let's have an actual conversation about if we were to do those things what would it actually look like.,109,,
706,0.97,4766.294,4766.528,Right?,109,,
707,0.97,4766.528,4768.163,What would it look like?,109,,
708,0.97,4768.163,4771.766,That's where I'm at for the first 100 days.,109,,
709,0.97,4771.766,4787.415,I'll be explaining and rolling this out a little bit better in our upcoming CPC meetings and you all will be able to track and follow along as to the things I will be Prioritizing with the support of the full Commission.,109,,

739,0.97,4854.549,4868.23,"An ordinance relating to the appropriations for the human services Department, approving a spending plan amending ordinance 126237 which adopted the to 21 budget.",127,,
740,0.97,4868.23,4874.269,We have a number of folks with us here this morning to discuss this item.,128,,
741,0.97,4874.269,4897.292,What I'd like if possible if we could do a quick round of introductions just name and affiliation then I'm going to hand it off to Amy Gore to do the background and then we'll have the presentation from Hsd.,128,,
742,0.97,4897.292,4898.126,I'm Amy Gore.,129,,

748,0.97,4917.479,4920.415,"Natalie Thomson, human services Department.",133,,
749,0.97,4920.415,4920.749,Fantastic.,134,,
750,0.97,4920.749,4921.049,Thank you.,134,,
751,0.97,4921.049,4933.228,So you want to give us background and then we'll hand it off to Hsd and deputy Mayor Washington to walk us through the presentation.,134,,
752,0.97,4933.228,4933.595,Absolutely.,135,,
753,0.97,4933.595,4933.895,Thank you.,135,,
754,0.97,4933.895,4934.229,Good morning.,135,,
755,0.97,4934.229,4941.403,Item eight on the agenda is Council bill 120011.,135,,
756,0.97,4941.403,4950.245,Which APPROVES $12 million spending plan for community safety capacity building and AMENDS the 2021 budget to lift a proviso.,135,,
757,0.97,4950.245,4964.826,As you recall the 2021 adopted budget includes $12 million in funds for capacity building activities aimed at Scaling up Community-Led organizations to increase public safety.,135,,
758,0.97,4964.826,4975.503,Council placed on these funds and specified for $10 million of the funds the proviso could only be lifted after the Council APPROVES the plan.,135,,
759,0.97,4975.503,4984.713,The human services Department is here to discuss that spending plan and the outreach and engagement work that went into the develop of the of the spending plan.,135,,
760,0.97,4984.713,4989.784,Unless there are any questions I will turn it over to director Howell from Hsd.,135,,
761,0.97,4989.784,4995.59,While we do that I just want to add a few words.,136,,
762,0.97,4995.59,5008.703,"Again, as background for the viewing public, we did have director Howell and her team present a brief overview of this work at the January 26th committee meeting.",136,,
763,0.97,5008.703,5020.548,Following that presentation director Howell responded fully to questions that we had developed in a memo that was distributed to committee members and the answers were received on February 18th.,136,,
764,0.97,5020.548,5029.924,I just want to say that I personally have felt a lot of urgency around getting these dollars out the door.,136,,
765,0.97,5029.924,5033.261,That commitment was made to community long ago at this point.,136,,
766,0.97,5033.261,5045.573,And I've asked that the human services Department work to expedite the funding while still balancing the need for effective community engagement to inform the Rfp.,136,,
767,0.97,5045.573,5054.482,This funding is a key investment in the Council's work to Reimagine public safety.,136,,
768,0.97,5054.482,5063.658,This is part after $16 million total appropriation in 2021 to scale up Community-Led organizations.,136,,
769,0.97,5063.658,5079.674,"And again, it's a high priority and key request not just of the Council but it comes from community led by the King County equity now coalition last summer.",136,,
770,0.97,5079.674,5089.584,Hsd moved very quickly moved the initial $4 million out the door to the community safety initiative under the leadership of community passage ways.,136,,
771,0.97,5089.584,5103.665,We heard a presentation on their work at the January 26th meeting and how they're focused with a geographic effort in three different Seattle neighborhoods.,136,,
772,0.97,5103.665,5143.271,Community safety hubs that have wrap around services and now these investments I think are really important because they are intended to help community members really look at how they can provide services in the current system through a public health framework while also understanding the range of needs given our existing community safety programs and working with Hsd to identify gaps or duplication in programs that the city supports.,136,,
773,0.97,5143.271,5172.066,"Ultimately our goal is to move the city's community safety strategy toward a public health center harm reduction model, crime prevention and harm caused by the criminal legal system to individuals and communities most impacted and with that yes, let's hand it over to director Howell to walk us through the presentation.",136,,
774,0.97,5172.066,5176.538,I'm going to open us up and then I'll hand it over to director Howell.,137,,
775,0.97,5176.538,5179.307,I just want to make a few remarks.,137,,
776,0.97,5179.307,5184.746,So I shared this before but I do kneel it's appropriate to do so again given the subject at hand.,137,,
777,0.97,5184.746,5189.984,My older brother Michael spent most of his life in prison.,137,,
778,0.97,5189.984,5197.992,I remember watching him on multiple occasions being thrown down by the police crying and asking for help.,137,,
779,0.97,5197.992,5204.265,There caused me to grow up with a negative image of who they are and how they treat people.,137,,
780,0.97,5204.265,5211.172,My brother was shot and died at Harborview hospital over ten years ago.,137,,
781,0.97,5211.172,5211.406,Sorry.,137,,
782,0.97,5211.406,5225.987,"With this history in mind, please know that I care deeply about the subject matter and agree that it is necessary to pour resources into communities of color to start repairing the harm done.",137,,
783,0.97,5225.987,5229.123,With that said the budget acts this year are only the beginning.,137,,
784,0.97,5229.123,5235.93,We will not see significant changes for decades as the community system is strengthened.,137,,
785,0.97,5235.93,5239.534,What this fund willing not do is result in instant community safety.,137,,
786,0.97,5239.534,5246.007,You will see this theme reflected in the community engagement conducted by Hsd.,137,,
787,0.97,5246.007,5249.978,No one is saying that they believe that they can replace a police function.,137,,
788,0.97,5249.978,5259.12,What they are saying is that they believe they have an important role in ensuring that their communities are safe and thriving.,137,,
789,0.97,5259.12,5268.262,Black people were enslaved for over 400 years and we cannot be expected to get better in a year or two as there is a lot of repair needed.,137,,
790,0.97,5268.262,5272.367,Reducing the police budget to invest in communities this year will not result in immediate change.,137,,
791,0.97,5272.367,5273.468,I have to say that again.,137,,
792,0.97,5273.468,5281.409,"When I call the police for help and I'm a black woman, I have an expectation that someone will come to assist me in a reasonable amount of time.",137,,
793,0.97,5281.409,5285.279,This is not our current reality in the city right now.,137,,
794,0.97,5285.279,5291.552,"As you will see in the presentation you have next by SPD, our citizens aren't feeling safe and supported.",137,,
795,0.97,5291.552,5299.36,Our police force is short staffed and that has impacted their ability to respond.,137,,
796,0.97,5299.36,5302.93,Yes the institution of policing was created to keep white people in power.,137,,
797,0.97,5302.93,5319.614,It needs to be rebuilt but in the interim as public servants we are responsible to ensure that all Seattle residents feel safe and supported.,137,,
798,0.97,5319.614,5322.684,Let us do this apart from political grand standing.,137,,
799,0.97,5322.684,5334.362,This is the commitment that I and the Mayor have,137,,
800,0.97,5335.496,5343.137,Thank you for your remarks.,138,,
801,0.97,5343.137,5353.848,"As Councilmember Herbold mentioned, in January the safety and human services gave an overview.",138,,
802,0.97,5353.848,5370.698,"Since then the request for proposal was released on March 1 . and today Hst will provide an overview of the Rfp guidelines and application as well as next steps . The presentation includes Hsd spending plan, a requirement to live the proviso.",138,,
803,0.97,5370.698,5377.572,With that I will hand it over to the deputy director of Hsd to leave the presentation.,138,,
804,0.97,5377.572,5378.573,Thank you.,138,,
805,0.97,5378.573,5379.907,Good morning.,139,,
806,0.97,5379.907,5394.188,I have the privilege of presenting the remainder of the slides . I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for framing and also to director Howell for framing the presentation.,139,,
807,0.97,5394.188,5404.899,And especially to deputy Mayor Washington for sharing her personal story.,139,,
808,0.97,5404.899,5413.007,I am going to move quickly through some of the slides because it adds additional language around the framing.,139,,
809,0.97,5413.007,5416.21,The first one you see is the Reimagining community safety.,139,,
810,0.97,5416.21,5422.316,This Articulates the work that the city has undergone in 2020 as well as the work ahead.,139,,
811,0.97,5422.316,5436.097,"Hsd as Councilmember Herbold has reminded us, is really focusing on implementing a couple of key pieces in this Overarching work that we are doing collectively as a city.",139,,
812,0.97,5436.097,5444.439,Today we are focusing on the community safety capacity building Rfp specifically.,139,,
813,0.97,5444.439,5453.147,That is of $12 million investment.,139,,
814,0.97,5453.147,5464.659,Hsd is conducting an expedited process . normally we would do extensive community engagement.,139,,
815,0.97,5464.659,5480.074,"As well as literature review to do this body of work . But in this expedited process in the month of January and February, we were able to conduct conversations with 36 Stakeholders in the community.",139,,
816,0.97,5480.074,5492.587,"Sessions were attended by community members with lived experiences, systemic racism, harm from the legal system.",139,,
817,0.97,5492.587,5514.475,"Participants identified things around community ownership, self-determination and resilience and had expansive view of community safety that reached beyond gun violence and effects to violence and sexual violence to a broader sense of well-being.",139,,
818,0.97,5514.475,5515.943,It is no surprise that themes included community safety is broad.,139,,
819,0.97,5515.943,5524.719,Must be defined and owned by individuals and groups for themselves.,139,,
820,0.97,5524.719,5532.527,Reimagining community safety cannot simply be alternatives to police functions and the definition of capacity building for the purpose of this Rfp must be broad and not just include building and strengthening structures.,139,,
821,0.97,5532.527,5536.43,"In summary, the definition of community safety must be Holistic and inclusive.",139,,
822,0.97,5536.43,5541.402,A couple of quotes I want to highlight from the feedback.,139,,
823,0.97,5541.402,5544.438,They are here and shown on the slide.,139,,
824,0.97,5544.438,5547.108,Don't define community safety for us.,139,,
825,0.97,5547.108,5549.11,Ask us to define it for you.,139,,
826,0.97,5549.11,5550.711,It's different for every community.,139,,
827,0.97,5550.711,5557.752,That was a Gender-Based violence survivor.,139,,
828,0.97,5557.752,5560.454,"Secondly, we don't really see ourselves in national models.",139,,
829,0.97,5560.454,5567.962,We do our work by meeting people where they are at . and that was a youth violence dimension provider.,139,,
830,0.97,5567.962,5582.176,"In our community engagement, we did ask about the intercept model and where as providers they saw themselves.",139,,
831,0.97,5582.176,5589.45,Hsd placed self identified community responses on the intercept model and the prevention intervention continuum.,139,,
832,0.97,5589.45,5595.756,"Many participants vocalize some version of, we do many and all activities on this continuum.",139,,
833,0.97,5595.756,5598.192,We took the feedback and we plotted on a table where they identify themselves.,139,,
834,0.97,5598.192,5614.942,"And that table, if interested, is found in the spending plan and you can look at the Appendices.",139,,
835,0.97,5616.978,5621.615,"The Rfp does not restrict applicants to specific intercepts giving the overwhelming community feedback about meeting people where they are at and following them in the journey, which is oftentimes not like this linear.",139,,
836,0.97,5621.615,5625.92,Now I will go deep into the Rfp.,139,,
837,0.97,5625.92,5633.594,And provide some highlights.,139,,
838,0.97,5633.594,5635.196,The Rfp is an open competitive process with approximately $10.4 million.,139,,
839,0.97,5635.196,5659.82,We talked about $12 million and we will explain where the total is . before the purpose of the Rfp is $10.4 million of available funds Awardees will receive a 18 month contract starting on July 1. the Rfp was released on March 1. it is open and available and you can find it on a Website.,139,,
840,0.97,5659.82,5664.525,The Rfp is released and applications are due on April 9.,139,,
841,0.97,5664.525,5668.462,Additionally we are providing technical assistance to support organizations to complete the application.,139,,
842,0.97,5668.462,5681.909,And those technical advisors were Vetted by our partners at the Seattle office of civil rights a shout out to them as well as our colleagues within Hsd.,139,,
843,0.97,5681.909,5682.343,Thank you for that.,139,,
844,0.97,5682.343,5684.278,Funding recommendations will be made by a community panel.,139,,
845,0.97,5684.278,5692.386,And we anticipate up to 40 proposals that may be funded through this process.,139,,
846,0.97,5692.386,5700.027,Taking a quick step back and trying to frame this.,139,,
847,0.97,5700.027,5712.907,The Council budget actions for this Rfp totaled $12 million for community led efforts to scale up Organiztions to increase public safety through technical support capacity building expansion of capacity.,139,,
848,0.97,5712.907,5762.623,"For the purpose of this Rfp we are picking a capacity building as this, expanding the capacity of community led solutions that contribute to overall community safety by developing and strengthening the skills, instincts, abilities, processes and resources that organizations and communities need to survive, adapt, and thrive . for the purpose of the Rfp we are focusing on populations . communities but underscoring black, indigenous, people of color, indigenous, it is focusing on an emphasis on black and immigrant refugee communities because these groups are experiencing Disproportional harm from the criminal legal system.",139,,
849,0.97,5762.623,5777.771,The next slide illustrates a high level of the program requirements and who we are looking to invest in.,139,,
850,0.97,5777.771,5780.608,The Rfp is Prioritizing community led groups and organizations who are generally led by the communities that they intend to serve.,139,,
851,0.97,5780.608,5794.288,We want to see the staff of leadership representing the communities that we just described.,139,,
852,0.97,5794.288,5797.291,We want these organizations to have a commitment to building power in the community and/or supporting healing from the impact of oppression.,139,,
853,0.97,5797.291,5812.74,"The organizations should be committed to addressing internalized oppression and/or affirming all members of the community and are committed to ending all forms of oppression including able is them, Homophobia, Trans Phobia, and Misogyny.",139,,
854,0.97,5812.74,5823.484,At the end of the day we are increasing capacity for additional services . But we are interested in supporting organizations who are also part of positive social change and social justice.,139,,
855,0.97,5823.484,5839.967,"If the applicants are representative of programs of Multi-Service organizations, large national multimillion organizations, the majority of program leadership that is local should be representative of communities that they intend to serve.",139,,
856,0.97,5839.967,5842.436,We are not limiting the size of the organization.,139,,
857,0.97,5842.436,5855.015,"In terms of the awarded applicants, once we have the awards, we have expectations of performace Metrics.",139,,
858,0.97,5855.015,5860.554,And those will be negotiated at the time of us developing contracts with the individual organizations.,139,,
859,0.97,5860.554,5862.156,Based on the individual proposals.,139,,
860,0.97,5862.156,5870.831,The community is saying safety needs and solutions are going to be unique.,139,,
861,0.97,5870.831,5891.752,"That said, we are expecting those awarded organizations to participate in a learning community where we will partner with an external group such as the Seattle community safety initiative to have systemwide coordination meetings.",139,,
862,0.97,5891.752,5904.398,"The meetings will be opportunities to share information and resources, make referrals and build relationships as well as really beefing up enhancing our network of community led safety providers.",139,,
863,0.97,5904.398,5908.202,This space will be created for collaboration and ongoing community led solutions to safety and Hsd will be there in partnership as well.,139,,
864,0.97,5908.202,5923.183,"And finally, the bigger picture vision, we are committed to hiring external team of researchers and Evaluators to help develop community level indicators of success.",139,,
865,0.97,5923.183,5930.09,Which ultimately will get us to the Northstar we can collectively have been working towards.,139,,
866,0.97,5930.09,5930.991,And getting to the spending plan.,139,,
867,0.97,5930.991,5936.83,We discussed there is a $12 million investment.,139,,
868,0.97,5936.83,5947.241,"The spending plan does showcase the majority of the funds are 85% approximately, $10.4 million will be awarded to the organizations through those contracts.",139,,
869,0.97,5947.241,5955.749,Hsd is committed to providing Honorariums providing technical assistance that I explained.,139,,
870,0.97,5955.749,5962.356,And the external research team as well as a couple of staff to manage the contracts.,139,,
871,0.97,5962.356,5967.561,That the spending plan Articulates where the funds will go to.,139,,
872,0.97,5967.561,5975.135,And the spending plan is a requirement to lift the proviso.,139,,
873,0.97,5975.135,5978.772,And that really is essentially the overview of the Rfp and how we got here.,139,,
874,0.97,5978.772,5989.75,"As Councilmember Herbold said, it is important to get these funds out to the community as soon as possible and we hope we have delivered on that expectation.",139,,
875,0.97,5989.75,5999.36,We can field some questions.,139,,
876,0.97,5999.36,6007.801,Thank you so much.,140,,
877,0.97,6007.801,6015.075,I appreciate the thought and care that has gone into the development of the Rfp.,140,,

879,0.97,6020.114,6033.727,I want to take a moment and underscore I think that the use of the network convening is a tool moving forward is really inspired.,140,,
880,0.97,6033.727,6038.432,And really good thinking.,140,,
881,0.97,6038.432,6053.213,"Again, this is really about creating a network and ensuring that we are doing what we always say in government.",140,,
882,0.97,6053.213,6053.714,Get rid of the silos.,140,,
883,0.97,6053.714,6059.753,In order to do that and be effective we have to create a place where people can collaborate.,140,,
884,0.97,6059.753,6095.689,"They can really leverage their unique expertise . that is another element that I have heard from the community engagement . Recognizing that different organizations and working with different communities, their own unique expertise and we need to do more as a city to lift that up and not expect everybody to be a generalist and recognize that specialized intervention into unique communities is a valuable thing.",140,,
885,0.97,6095.689,6099.259,That we want to enhance and support.,140,,
886,0.97,6099.259,6106.366,I appreciate that we are also creating this place to identify the gaps.,140,,
887,0.97,6106.366,6129.756,Reduce duplication A. and honor the expertise of folks who do have specialized capabilities and specialized relationships with community.,140,,
888,0.97,6130.791,6141.535,"As mentioned, the ordinance itself that we have before us is because the Council placed a proviso on these funds and we wanted to hear from Hsd both about the Rfp process as they developed it as well as the plans for the spend plan.",140,,
889,0.97,6141.535,6151.678,The information that you provided today . satisfies the councils expectations for purposes of lifting the proviso.,140,,
890,0.97,6151.678,6157.718,"I do want to entertain questions from Councilmembers, should they have them.",140,,
891,0.97,6157.718,6161.221,Looking for both.,140,,
892,0.97,6161.221,6167.661,A virtually raised hand as well as an actual raised hand.,140,,
893,0.97,6167.661,6185.646,"Seeing none, we are going to move into acting on the bill and I move committee recommended passage of Council bill 12 0011.",140,,

915,0.97,6252.246,6273.166,"126237, which adopted the 2021 budget, including the 2021-2026 capital improvement program (CIP); changing appropriations to various departments and budget control levels, and from various funds in the budget; and adding or modifying Provisos.",145,,
916,0.97,6273.166,6273.634,"Thank you, Alex.",146,,
917,0.97,6273.634,6293.887,Kelly do a round of introductions please . name and affiliation and I will hand it over to Greg to do a quick introduction and background on this item and then we will hand it back over to SPD and the executive team to walk us through the presentation.,146,,
918,0.97,6293.887,6298.191,Council central staff.,147,,
919,0.97,6298.191,6303.397,Budget office.,148,,
920,0.97,6303.397,6308.769,Associate director of budget and finance for SPD.,149,,
921,0.97,6308.769,6312.773,Interim chief of police.,150,,

924,0.97,6320.614,6322.215,Thank you.,153,,
925,0.97,6322.215,6326.92,"Greg, some background on what brought us to the place we are today.",153,,
926,0.97,6326.92,6335.295,Thank you and good morning Madam chair and members of the public safety committee.,154,,
927,0.97,6335.295,6337.631,Item 9 on the agenda is Council bill 1191 81.,154,,
928,0.97,6337.631,6343.837,"This item, this bill was introduced on December 10 of last year.",154,,
929,0.97,6343.837,6345.338,And the bill is fairly straightforward.,154,,
930,0.97,6345.338,6363.857,It cuts from the SPD budget $5.4 million and it adds $5.4 million to finance general to find recommendations stemming from the city's Participatory budget process and imposes a proviso on that $5.4 million.,154,,
931,0.97,6363.857,6384.978,"By way of background, steps that the Council intended to take related to public safety including not supporting any increases to SPD's budget to offset overtime expenditures above the funds budgeted in 2020 or 2021 and expressed funded community led activities to invest in public safety.",154,,
932,0.97,6384.978,6393.987,"With that as background, I would turn it over to SPD.",154,,
933,0.97,6393.987,6410.871,I will say a couple more the bill had its first hearing on January 26 and at that time Council central staff did an overview of an analysis that central staff conducted on SPD's staffing and salary saving situation.,154,,
934,0.97,6410.871,6415.809,"And I think as most committee members are familiar with, there have been a great deal of unanticipated departures at SPD.",154,,
935,0.97,6415.809,6430.824,And as such there is a great deal of--considerable deal of salary savings available this year in the SPD budget.,154,,
936,0.97,6430.824,6434.528,The estimate that central staff provided at the last hearing on January 26 was $7.7 million.,154,,
937,0.97,6434.528,6443.904,"With heavy Caveats that number can change, depending on the number of folks that depart this year or come in this year as part of the hiring plan.",154,,
938,0.97,6443.904,6459.786,"As part of a central staff presentation, on January 26, we also talked a little bit about questions that the Council may want to consider when deciding to cut the $5.4 million.",154,,
939,0.97,6459.786,6475.068,And some of those questions are whether or not the $5.4 million should be cut or retained in the SPD budget.,154,,
940,0.97,6475.068,6481.074,"Spd has identified in a memo that accompany, central staff memo, purposes for which they would keep the money and invest the money in some public safety issues that they are currently experiencing.",154,,
941,0.97,6481.074,6484.244,They are here today to talk about those issues.,154,,
942,0.97,6484.244,6484.711,Before the Council.,154,,
943,0.97,6484.711,6489.483,And that is about all that I have.,154,,
944,0.97,6489.483,6492.586,Thank you.,155,,
945,0.97,6492.586,6500.26,"With that, we have no opening comments.",155,,
946,0.97,6500.26,6503.497,We will handed over to the executive team to walk us through the presentation.,155,,
947,0.97,6503.497,6511.738,Morning Councilmembers and thank you Councilmember Herbold for letting us be with you in committee this morning.,156,,
948,0.97,6511.738,6527.387,In a moment I will have this over to chief Diaz and his team to show the current state of the Department as it pertains to swan staffing levels and the corresponding operational and service impacts that they are experiencing.,156,,
949,0.97,6527.387,6538.198,Be fair to characterize that SPD is in a staffing crisis.,156,,
950,0.97,6538.198,6550.377,"With more than 200 officers having separated from the Department in the last 13 months, the Troll and 911 response challenges have been Expensed at every precinct.",156,,
951,0.97,6550.377,6566.493,"The Cascading impacts of chief Diaz needed to redeploy officers and mitigate for 911 response has negatively impacted other units, Euros, including investigations, training, civilian crime prevention and community service support.",156,,
952,0.97,6566.493,6568.628,All of which also jeopardizes our compliance with elements of the Federal consent decree.,156,,
953,0.97,6568.628,6582.876,"Again, SPD is at crisis staffing levels.",156,,
954,0.97,6582.876,6589.883,And I provide this context for you as part of your consideration as it relates to this $5.4 million budget action that is currently on the table.,156,,
955,0.97,6589.883,6609.069,$5.4 million that as I understand it is in addition to the already nearly $12 million and various budget Provisos you have in place on SPD from the end of 2020 as well as into 2021 and tying up a range of SPD resources pending various reports and other conditions being met.,156,,
956,0.97,6609.069,6616.476,This is all in addition to another $12 million that the Council cut on top of the Mayor's proposed budget last fall.,156,,
957,0.97,6616.476,6624.618,I do want to emphasize that we like you are committed to Reimagining policing and community safety.,156,,
958,0.97,6624.618,6634.561,Through the work you just heard from Hsd and the powerful opening remarks from deputy Mayor Washington on investments in community safety programs.,156,,
959,0.97,6634.561,6638.031,And what it will take to create sustained and meaningful change.,156,,
960,0.97,6638.031,6653.046,"Through our joint SPD interdepartmental teamwork, where multiple members of your Council staff are part of and analyzed 911 calls, look at SPD functions, and advanced innovation in reforms.",156,,
961,0.97,6653.046,6671.564,Through the creation of--health one and other--and through the major generational investments in communities to address decades of disparities and inequities where working together on.,156,,
962,0.97,6671.564,6682.175,"Fundamentally the truth of the matter is where we stand right now, is that we are not budgeting or staffed to sustain an Acceptale level of public safety services in Seattle.",156,,
963,0.97,6682.175,6697.257,It is vital that SPD is able to hold onto these resources that you are discussing today in order to mitigate impacts for the staffing crisis.,156,,
964,0.97,6697.257,6699.392,There were a number of strategies that chief Diaz and his team will discuss in their presentation.,156,,
965,0.97,6699.392,6718.211,"I urge you that as you continue to consider the budget reduction, that you give careful consideration to chief Diaz and his team's analysis . and their perspectives today before you make final decisions about further reductions to SPD.",156,,
966,0.97,6718.211,6720.914,Thank you.,156,,
967,0.97,6720.914,6724.384,What that I will turn it over to chief Diaz and Dr. Fisher to run through the Powerpoint presentation.,156,,
968,0.97,6724.384,6728.121,Thank you deputy Mayor Fong.,157,,
969,0.97,6728.121,6745.438,Good morning thank you for the opportunity to be here today and to go over the current plan to attempt to mitigate many of the effects of the staffing crisis that deputy Mayor Fong has mentioned.,158,,
970,0.97,6745.438,6760.019,Last week I know and I believe we all had a moment of joy and hope when President Biden announced the accelerated Timeline for having enough vaccine for every adult in the country.,158,,
971,0.97,6760.019,6761.554,This means we are on the cusp of some version of normal returning.,158,,
972,0.97,6761.554,6763.356,With back of the likelihood increased social interactions.,158,,
973,0.97,6763.356,6766.86,We all Miss her dearly.,158,,

977,0.97,6773.333,6778.938,It also means a likely increase in some types of criminal behavior and calls for service.,158,,
978,0.97,6778.938,6802.262,"As the chief of police the person charged with running the police Department I am is balance the hiring and staffing needs, operational needs, equipment needs, training needs, technology needs . at the start of each and every year I work with the public safety professionals in the Department to best determine how we will address the needs of the Department and how we will prepare for the unknown.",158,,
979,0.97,6802.262,6809.502,But by their very definition it is impossible to precisely plan for the unknowns that work is further complicated right now by an ever-changing budget.,158,,
980,0.97,6809.502,6828.655,"It moving forward the Department is expected to meet ever evolving demands while confronting significant reduced staffing, now indexed to match reductions and available budget, SPD will have to say no to requests for service.",158,,
981,0.97,6828.655,6829.756,Some things we have already had to do this year.,158,,
982,0.97,6829.756,6847.006,"I have a concern based on what I hear and when I speak with officers and when I review their exit interviews that continued tested the budget, especially those not matched efforts to reduce the immediate demands of the Department will only continue to drive further staffing losses . at this point it is a Self-Perpetuating cycle.",158,,
983,0.97,6847.006,6851.377,The best way to stop the losses and to drive hiring is to stop the ad hoc cutting of the budget.,158,,
984,0.97,6851.377,6854.647,We also know the staffing losses some seem to hope for have happened.,158,,
985,0.97,6854.647,6862.422,Not through an informed process of Rethinking or imagining the work we do.,158,,
986,0.97,6862.422,6871.464,But my concern is that if we don't change course the staffing losses will continue and we will have a staffing crisis beyond mitigation.,158,,
987,0.97,6871.464,6872.899,I know this Department is filled with amazing professionals.,158,,
988,0.97,6872.899,6873.9,I want all of the folks to stay.,158,,
989,0.97,6873.9,6881.374,We have lost some amazing people.,158,,
990,0.97,6881.374,6882.475,Painfully to jurisdictions across the city line.,158,,
991,0.97,6882.475,6893.386,I know I have heard questions about why is the Department talking about what it cannot do anymore and why it needs its full budget.,158,,
992,0.97,6893.386,6894.387,These calls are down and the crime is down.,158,,
993,0.97,6894.387,6895.321,"The reality is, a lot is not getting done.",158,,
994,0.97,6895.321,6896.522,And that is why we are still under pandemic restrictions.,158,,
995,0.97,6896.522,6900.093,We are on a priority calls that is too often.,158,,
996,0.97,6900.093,6902.962,Too many of us Ignitions are being enacted.,158,,
997,0.97,6902.962,6906.199,"Trainings have been reduced, delayed or shortened.",158,,
998,0.97,6906.199,6908.902,Sustained problem solving is on pause.,158,,
999,0.97,6908.902,6912.505,Invaluable civilian hires are on hold.,158,,
1000,0.97,6912.505,6925.318,Úi could put much of this into action if I knew we could address needs . to ensure we can respond to emergency calls as close to the goal response times as possible.,158,,
1001,0.97,6925.318,6926.986,I had to reassign individuals to patrol.,158,,
1002,0.97,6926.986,6937.63,"If that step had not been taken, I have little doubt about our response times would be through the roof and we would be at priority calls that is almost every day.",158,,
1003,0.97,6937.63,6944.337,But that came with the cost.,158,,
1004,0.97,6944.337,6945.505,And there are no more Problem- solving focused teams.,158,,
1005,0.97,6945.505,6960.72,"I had to reassign the community policing teams, I put off hiring a prevention coordinator, Anticrime team is essential, often working with partners to address underlying issues and they are now back in patrol.",158,,
1006,0.97,6960.72,6961.587,Half the traffic unit is in control.,158,,
1007,0.97,6961.587,6970.763,Detectives are back in patrol.,158,,
1008,0.97,6970.763,6971.664,And yet we continue to lose officers.,158,,
1009,0.97,6971.664,6973.266,It is no longer feasible to pull people back to patrol as a response.,158,,
1010,0.97,6973.266,6978.037,Units you have lost staff and because of the broader crisis are not able to Backfill to meet their needs.,158,,
1011,0.97,6978.037,6984.143,Professional standard bureaus and training are down across the board.,158,,
1012,0.97,6984.143,6992.785,These are units essential to ensure that we can meet the consent decree.,158,,
1013,0.97,6992.785,6994.22,People suggested reassigning a few more and moving other folks.,158,,
1014,0.97,6994.22,6995.755,At this point there is nothing more than robbing Peter to pay Paul.,158,,
1015,0.97,6995.755,7000.86,The work is not changed and I have over 200 few officers to deploy.,158,,
1016,0.97,7000.86,7003.262,This is not feasible and counterproductive.,158,,
1017,0.97,7003.262,7005.465,We are exhausting are officers.,158,,
1018,0.97,7005.465,7011.671,Their wellness is essential to provide the type of police service the community expects.,158,,
1019,0.97,7011.671,7017.61,I need to be able to commit both more sworn and civilian resources to such needed efforts.,158,,
1020,0.97,7017.61,7026.719,But I cannot do that or I don't know what the budget is.,158,,
1021,0.97,7026.719,7027.587,And the staffing challenges intensify.,158,,
1022,0.97,7027.587,7034.827,We have solutions and opportunities to mitigate the constraints but those opportunities come with cost.,158,,
1023,0.97,7034.827,7038.164,We believe we can cover the cost in our budget while also advancing the broader work to think about alternatives that eventually can help share the work.,158,,
1024,0.97,7038.164,7057.917,"Today we hope we make it clear where the police Department currently stands and why it is essential we use our existing budget appropriation to be more efficient, more agile, more supportive of current employees and more attractive to potential hires.",158,,
1025,0.97,7057.917,7061.254,To achieve this money to be able to manage the Department right now the instability in our budget is causing massive instability in the apart Department.,158,,
1026,0.97,7061.254,7061.687,Including staffing.,158,,
1027,0.97,7061.687,7067.16,As I noted we do not know what 2021 will look like.,158,,
1028,0.97,7067.16,7072.732,"But right now, I know that we have no flexibility and we cannot count on losing any salary savings to address the losses.",158,,
1029,0.97,7072.732,7078.471,I will turn it over to the executive director to go over the presentation.,158,,
1030,0.97,7078.471,7088.281,Thank you.,158,,
1031,0.97,7088.281,7095.755,Good morning counsel.,159,,
1032,0.97,7095.755,7099.759,"As the chief said, I will try to be brief.",159,,
1033,0.97,7099.759,7103.663,I know we are a little behind and we want to have a discussion.,159,,
1034,0.97,7103.663,7105.698,You can go ahead to the next slide.,159,,
1035,0.97,7105.698,7110.303,Just a quick overview.,159,,
1036,0.97,7110.303,7121.08,It will some of the 2021 budget actions . We will look at where we are right now and where we are going.,159,,
1037,0.97,7121.08,7126.219,And then how that translates to our 911 response times which is really the frontline way that most people experience their interaction with SPD.,159,,
1038,0.97,7126.219,7133.993,And we will talk about how this translates into outputs and outcomes of public safety and the consent decree.,159,,
1039,0.97,7133.993,7143.603,"Just of the summary, at the end of this if we want to dive into it, we can go really into the weeds on budget.",159,,
1040,0.97,7143.603,7158.417,In general will look at the 2020 versus 2021 adopted it is a $46 million reduction in the 2021 adopted budget.,159,,
1041,0.97,7158.417,7173.799,"That came with a variety of mechanisms to get there from transferring some resources out of the Department, to reductions in overtime for special events and some other categories and things as the chief mentioned and a lot of decisions were made when we had a different outlook on what the pandemic might look like in 2021.",159,,
1042,0.97,7173.799,7182.675,Bt this is where we start in addition to some of the proviso funds that the deputy Mayor eluded to.,159,,
1043,0.97,7182.675,7189.248,I just want to add . about $36 million of the reduction is from transfers.,160,,
1044,0.97,7189.248,7195.488,"Transfers of 911, office of emergency management.",160,,
1045,0.97,7195.488,7200.76,And I can't remember the third.,160,,
1046,0.97,7200.76,7203.095,--,160,,
1047,0.97,7203.095,7211.671,"To that point then, I'm sorry, I just interrupted.",161,,
1048,0.97,7211.671,7223.716,"I was want to say, to that point then waited Dr. Fisher, would it be more accurate to say $10 million on that slide.",161,,
1049,0.97,7223.716,7224.951,In terms of the implications we are discussing today?,161,,
1050,0.97,7224.951,7234.994,That was a question I wrote down when I saw that slide but before we go further I just want to ask.,161,,
1051,0.97,7234.994,7240.833,We will leave the budget stuff to Angela or Dr. noble.,162,,
1052,0.97,7240.833,7241.734,I don't want to get a number wrong.,162,,
1053,0.97,7241.734,7243.502,I don't keep the budget numbers in my head.,162,,
1054,0.97,7243.502,7268.628,"To the extent that the $30 million of the $46 million was tied specifically to the transfers, the true impact to the personal budget and our equipment and travel training budget was definitely a smaller amount.",163,,
1055,0.97,7268.628,7286.612,Relative to baseline budget the reduction was about $20 million in the proposed budget and approximately $12 million for the reduced --,164,,
1056,0.97,7287.613,7293.352,Before we get into the discussion more we should just establish what the baseline is a maybe Greg could jump in.,165,,
1057,0.97,7293.352,7302.194,"46 being presented as the context starter, I would like a little bit more detail about how that breaks down.",165,,
1058,0.97,7302.194,7306.465,"Yes, Madam chair.",166,,
1059,0.97,7306.465,7313.739,"To your question, Councilmember, yes there are --",166,,
1060,0.97,7313.739,7315.908,Can we go back to the slide?,167,,
1061,0.97,7315.908,7316.142,Sorry.,167,,
1062,0.97,7316.142,7319.578,And we go back to the slide.,167,,
1063,0.97,7319.578,7321.514,Thank you.,167,,
1064,0.97,7321.514,7326.786,Sorry to interrupt.,168,,
1065,0.97,7326.786,7330.623,Not at all.,169,,
1066,0.97,7330.623,7350.81,"Building back from the $362 million that you see in the 2021 budget, as has been stated the Council cut about $12 million . and that would have been about $384 million originally and the $12 million that got cut largely was in salary savings.",169,,
1067,0.97,7350.81,7372.031,About $8.1 million . and then there was another--the second largest cut was $3.7 million in the overtime budget under the assumption that there would be a reduced demand for services due to the Covid-19 pandemic.,169,,
1068,0.97,7372.031,7375.267,Upwards from there the reductions that were made in the Mayor's budget I would probably turn to the CBO to outline those.,169,,
1069,0.97,7375.267,7385.478,Dr. noble.,169,,
1070,0.97,7385.611,7386.679,"Before we do that, just so I have the numbers.",170,,
1071,0.97,7386.679,7398.557,You said $8.1 million in salary savings . that was a reduction to SPD's budget that was proposed by the Council.,170,,
1072,0.97,7398.557,7406.165,"That is the first one, correct.",170,,
1073,0.97,7406.165,7406.432,Yes.,171,,
1074,0.97,7406.432,7424.316,"The two largest expenditures where the $8.1 million in salary savings that were cut by the Council and the assumptions there were, a number of SPD officers that had already left, not an assumption, they had already left would free up salary savings in the 2021 budget and that was $6 million.",171,,
1075,0.97,7424.316,7431.49,There was another $2 million in expected attrition savings for 2021.,171,,
1076,0.97,7431.49,7436.862,And those things added to the $8.1 million in salary savings assumptions.,171,,
1077,0.97,7436.862,7450.342,"And the second thing you mentioned was, $3.7 million Council driven reduction of the budget in the overtime area, is that what you said?",172,,
1078,0.97,7450.342,7450.943,"Yes, Council President.",173,,
1079,0.97,7450.943,7457.116,"$3.7 million specifically to special events, I should say all over time.",173,,
1080,0.97,7457.116,7462.054,Focused on special events and other Covid related activities.,173,,
1081,0.97,7462.054,7471.63,So that could be anything from special events to traffic.,173,,
1082,0.97,7471.63,7472.998,Anything that would have reduced demand due to the pandemic.,173,,
1083,0.97,7472.998,7475.234,And that was $3.7 million.,173,,
1084,0.97,7475.234,7479.638,There was also a cut --,174,,
1085,0.97,7479.638,7480.005,Go ahead.,175,,
1086,0.97,7480.005,7481.774,Go ahead.,176,,
1087,0.97,7481.774,7487.379,There were also some other cuts to travel.,177,,
1088,0.97,7487.379,7488.013,I think there's a delay.,178,,
1089,0.97,7488.013,7493.285,We are talking over each other.,178,,
1090,0.97,7493.285,7497.356,I will stop talking until you finish getting through.,178,,
1091,0.97,7497.356,7506.198,There were also some cuts to travel and training that were smaller . and I don't have those exact figures in front of me but I am sure Angela does.,179,,
1092,0.97,7506.198,7536.529,"Just between the $8.1 million in the $3.7 million, that is about $11.8 million plus whatever the travel and training was . and that is why we have been saying 12 man dollars of reductions that were Council driven on top of whatever the Council baseline was.",180,,
1093,0.97,7536.529,7547.64,"The other thing I wanted to mention is, I know in the salary savings area, there was a proviso that I sponsored.",180,,
1094,0.97,7547.64,7553.913,Are you including that in the $8.1 million or is that in addition to the $8.1 million?,180,,
1095,0.97,7553.913,7560.219,That is something that is completely separate Council President.,181,,
1096,0.97,7560.219,7561.153,I am not including back.,181,,
1097,0.97,7561.153,7566.525,That funding and appropriation authority is still in SPD's budget.,181,,
1098,0.97,7566.525,7569.662,It is just restricted at this point.,181,,
1099,0.97,7569.662,7569.929,Okay.,182,,
1100,0.97,7569.929,7583.309,Thanks . So we have about $11.8 million accounted for that were generated by councils for budget process and 2020 process of the $46 million.,182,,
1101,0.97,7583.309,7585.044,Yes.,183,,
1102,0.97,7585.044,7595.788,And the difference to the 12 or 12.1 is minor cuts or smaller cuts to travel in training and discretionary purchases.,183,,
1103,0.97,7595.788,7598.257,Okay.,184,,
1104,0.97,7598.257,7611.637,"I think one important point to clarify, 2020 adopted figure is not really the appropriate want to compare as we look at reductions for 2021.",185,,
1105,0.97,7611.637,7627.219,It is important to recognize there were basic inflationary wage increases . The baseline budget for 2021 would have cost to reproduce to 2020 activities and proceeded as expected would have been closer to for the $20 million.,185,,
1106,0.97,7627.219,7629.922,The effective reduction is closer to $60 million.,185,,
1107,0.97,7629.922,7634.793,In total.,185,,
1108,0.97,7634.793,7637.997,"Just as you think about the impacts to operations, I think that is important to understand.",185,,
1109,0.97,7637.997,7641.467,"I am a little slow on the uptake, Dr. noble.",186,,
1110,0.97,7641.467,7650.242,Can you sort of Deconstruct that for me so I understand the point you're trying to make.,186,,
1111,0.97,7650.242,7655.714,I would be happy to.,187,,
1112,0.97,7655.714,7661.854,"For all city departments when we start building the next years budget, which we are doing for 2022.",187,,
1113,0.97,7661.854,7688.213,"We take the budget for 2021 and build a new baseline for the following year that baseline reflects the fact that will cost more to do what they are doing this year through no fault of their own, if you will, because of basic inflation for things like materials and contracts on the like and specifically because of wage agreements that we have and people stepping through the salary bands.",187,,
1114,0.97,7688.213,7689.581,"There is an increment to budgets that just is, if you will.",187,,
1115,0.97,7689.581,7698.424,"And for SPD going into 2021, the baseline the net addition was about 10 and dollars which is less than 3%.",187,,
1116,0.97,7698.424,7707.099,It is a small figure but it means the effective starting point for 2021 was closer to $420 million instead of $410 million.,187,,
1117,0.97,7707.099,7728.72,"It is important to recognize that the baseline from which wants to start a comparison for 2021 is really substantially higher by an increment of $10 million . If we get into this level of precision, that is an important point.",187,,
1118,0.97,7728.72,7734.56,"I appreciate the additional Cotext and I think it is an important--for all of the departments, not just the police Department.",188,,
1119,0.97,7734.56,7738.63,That is an important piece of information to make sure we have.,188,,
1120,0.97,7738.63,7756.615,"Because this particular slide, slide 3 is couched in the context of the 2021 adopted budget as opposed to the 2021 adopted budget, new baseline starting January 2021.",188,,
1121,0.97,7756.615,7770.562,I just want to get an understanding how it relates to the characterization that we see on the slide.,188,,
1122,0.97,7770.562,7771.497,I appreciate the additional information.,188,,
1123,0.97,7771.497,7782.875,I just wanted to get clarity on the record about what is being represented on this slide . in the spirit of not wanting it to be taken out of context.,188,,
1124,0.97,7782.875,7794.286,I think that is where Councilmember Lewis is questions were coming from before he raised his hand . I was going to ask the same question.,188,,
1125,0.97,7794.286,7796.555,Around the $46 million number.,188,,
1126,0.97,7796.555,7817.075,"I think what I am trying to understand and make sure that members of the public understand, the $46 million in the 2021 adopted budget is actually a combination of budget cuts that were proposed by the Mayor in the proposed 2021 budget.",188,,
1127,0.97,7817.075,7829.221,And then there was a Council process that led to additional reductions in SPD budgets on top of that baseline.,188,,
1128,0.97,7829.221,7834.426,I think the conversation we are having now is trying to establish what that baseline was.,188,,
1129,0.97,7834.426,7859.551,"So that we can to the greatest extent possible I'll be honest brokers about where that baseline of the proposed 2021 adopted budget was and what the additional reductions that city council made . I think that is important, not to sort of create a who did what or point fingers, but to get an accurate record of who proposed what.",188,,
1130,0.97,7859.551,7870.529,So we can make a Factually driven decision on the $5.4 million.,188,,
1131,0.97,7870.529,7873.031,I will admit publicly I have a lot of questions about.,188,,
1132,0.97,7873.031,7910.135,"In the spirit of making sure we understand what the numbers are in with the past work has been, especially given how this conversation has been framed at the top, I think is an important exercise and I appreciate the willingness of you all to answer those questions so we have that important clarity around what was proposed in the 2021 proposed budget and what we adoped in the 2021 budget, before we get to the conversation of and now here we are in 2021 and there is a bunch of other variables that we need to take into consideration.",188,,
1133,0.97,7910.135,7919.411,I agree is relevant to the conversation around this Council bill and an additional $5.4 million reduction.,188,,
1134,0.97,7919.411,7927.92,I appreciate Council President Gonzalez about who proposed what.,189,,
1135,0.97,7927.92,7930.989,I don't want to lose track of the point that I was making in the original question.,189,,
1136,0.97,7930.989,7945.938,"Which is, of this $46 million that the 2021 budget adopted budget shows the reduction, $36 million was transfers.",189,,
1137,0.97,7945.938,7977.869,"If we are going to have a conversation about the staffing impacts of budget cuts, regardless of who proposed them, the Council or the Mayor, I think we should really stay focused on the reductions that actually have impacts, not $36 million in reductions that don't have an impact . because they are functions that have been transferred out of the Department.",189,,
1138,0.97,7977.869,7983.375,"I would say director noble about the baseline, the 2020 baseline would have to be reduced, even given what you are saying.",189,,
1139,0.97,7983.375,7999.591,"The 2020 baseline should be increased over $109 million to look at 2021 baseline, you would have to reduce the dollars for the functions that had been moved out of the Department as well.",189,,
1140,0.97,7999.591,8002.294,I figured it already did that.,190,,
1141,0.97,8002.294,8009.101,The figure you quoted removed $36 million --,191,,
1142,0.97,8009.101,8012.404,I believe it was --,192,,
1143,0.97,8012.404,8023.815,If I may speak up . The $36 million during the Council phase was reduced down to $22 million to account for the delay of the transfer.,193,,
1144,0.97,8023.815,8046.638,"Into June of this year, pending the creation of the new community safety and communication center departments . The total general fund reduction that SPD took, we initially proposed a $20.4 million reduction which was about 5% of our baseline budget.",193,,
1145,0.97,8046.638,8053.412,That was accounted for and Vcancies savings around $10.4 million.,193,,
1146,0.97,8053.412,8069.06,Civilian vacancy Savings and it was anticipated was going to achieved by holding 40 civilian positions vacant through the rest of the year.,193,,
1147,0.97,8069.06,8069.895,That was a $4.1 million reduction.,193,,
1148,0.97,8069.895,8074.065,The ot reduction has been Referenced by Greg.,193,,
1149,0.97,8074.065,8074.699,$2.7 million for this year.,193,,
1150,0.97,8074.699,8081.373,And we also took salary adjustments do to the demographic bubble.,193,,
1151,0.97,8081.373,8092.05,We have a younger workforce now and accounted for the savings attributed to the reduced longevity of our workforce.,193,,
1152,0.97,8092.05,8104.196,Later in the proposed budget process we increase that number from 20.4 million up to $28.4 million.,193,,
1153,0.97,8104.196,8105.363,And I believe that was built into the adopted budget.,193,,
1154,0.97,8105.363,8115.106,"When you see the $46 million, keep in mind that the total eventually the total amount attributable to the transfers is going to be in the 30 some million dollar range.",193,,
1155,0.97,8115.106,8140.532,"That was built into the budget is about $22 million, which is where we get--when you factor in some of the ads, the OPA staff person and a few other budget items for the West Seattle bridge closure and some of the automated enforcement, that is where you will get the net change of $36 million.",193,,
1156,0.97,8140.532,8144.636,Let's move on.,194,,
1157,0.97,8144.636,8151.743,I'm glad I turned it over to the budget folks.,195,,
1158,0.97,8151.743,8154.045,Go ahead.,196,,
1159,0.97,8154.045,8162.754,As the deputy Mayor and the chief mentioned I will not stay on this long.,197,,
1160,0.97,8162.754,8178.97,We are hoping in this presentation and this outline and some of the points that were made in the memo to staff and Council about what we think is driving the staffing restraints and how we hope to be able to address those moving forward.,197,,
1161,0.97,8178.97,8197.656,And also reminding us all that there are upcoming efforts that are currently not funded in the budget around large-scale vaccination efforts and hopefully as the chief eluded to with the speeding up of the vaccine Timeline.,197,,
1162,0.97,8197.656,8205.197,Special events may take place in 2021 and they are not currently supported in the budget.,197,,
1163,0.97,8205.197,8208.099,We have seen the slide.,197,,
1164,0.97,8208.099,8211.67,I will hit on it real quick.,197,,
1165,0.97,8211.67,8221.479,"Going back for 22 years, the median attrition from the Department of separation the resignations or retirements has been 56.",197,,
1166,0.97,8221.479,8226.318,It starts to go above that number in 2015 and has stayed above that.,197,,
1167,0.97,8226.318,8238.296,Some of that is the natural cyclical procedure of when large-scale officers were hired in the 90S.,197,,
1168,0.97,8238.296,8248.173,And other Federal funding that supported some of the work and general up staffing of police departments across the country in the 90S and people reach their retirement age.,197,,
1169,0.97,8248.173,8252.811,We do all remember we had an Uptick that was noticeable in 2018.,197,,
1170,0.97,8252.811,8254.212,And we had a decent year last year.,197,,
1171,0.97,8254.212,8258.483,We had--in 2019.,197,,
1172,0.97,8258.483,8261.62,I keep forgetting we are in 2021.,197,,
1173,0.97,8261.62,8269.227,2019 we had a good year for Úhiring and we are starting to Clawback from the losses of 2018.,197,,
1174,0.97,8269.227,8270.395,And 2020 we lost 186 officers.,197,,
1175,0.97,8270.395,8279.771,We started out the year strong with separation low and hiring looking well.,197,,
1176,0.97,8279.771,8300.859,"As Covid said in an other budget constraints became apparent, the city in general and SPD had a hiring freeze . We stopped at 51 hires and we lost 135 net officers in 2020.",197,,
1177,0.97,8300.859,8306.197,"What we have to think about Incontext, that is just officers sworn employees of the Department who are sitting in funded positions.",198,,
1178,0.97,8306.197,8320.078,"We also have had as we look at a workforce, at one end of the tale is increasingly young.",198,,
1179,0.97,8320.078,8324.115,"Since we have no age limit, we take everyone who is Interesed in they can pass the standards.",198,,
1180,0.97,8324.115,8334.726,We do sometimes are a little older workforce because the nature of the Union contracts and commitment to the job and people sometimes stay 30+ years.,198,,
1181,0.97,8334.726,8345.603,We are moving toward also we have to think about our deployable officer number not just the number of officers who are technically sitting in a funded position.,198,,
1182,0.97,8345.603,8360.185,When we look at our deployable officer count in the historical data which we are working to repair so the number gets closer to 1400 in the past.,198,,
1183,0.97,8360.185,8370.328,"If we look from mid 2018 until now, you can see the drop in officers.",198,,
1184,0.97,8370.328,8376.167,It is adjusted not to exaggerate the drop but you can see the fluctuation.,198,,
1185,0.97,8376.167,8378.737,There is natural fluctuation month-to-month.,198,,
1186,0.97,8378.737,8395.92,"But starting in Mid-2020 we really see the deployable officer number, the people can physically work on the street or in any other position where a sworn officer is needed that number drops . There is a little spike in early October.",198,,
1187,0.97,8395.92,8401.126,I think some of that is the chief's Reassignment of folks and some of the initial Covid response.,198,,
1188,0.97,8401.126,8405.463,We attribute a lot of this initial drop to people going out on Covid restriction.,198,,
1189,0.97,8405.463,8417.108,We were very strict if people might have been exposed.,198,,
1190,0.97,8417.108,8421.913,I think a lot of that work including access to Ppe was successful.,198,,
1191,0.97,8421.913,8429.287,The last count I saw since the start we only had 56 employees test positive.,198,,
1192,0.97,8429.287,8429.788,Out of close to 2000.,198,,
1193,0.97,8429.788,8431.189,That is a remarkable achievement from a lot of folks.,198,,
1194,0.97,8431.189,8436.795,And maybe a little bit of luck.,198,,
1195,0.97,8436.795,8451.442,"While that was putting people out on isolation or quarantine, we saw individuals not be able to take time off because a lot of people were in heavy deployment due to demonstrations and protests and people were injured and exhausted.",198,,
1196,0.97,8451.442,8457.348,And people had to take medical leave for medical mental health leave.,198,,
1197,0.97,8457.348,8458.249,Something we encourage everyone to do.,198,,
1198,0.97,8458.249,8480.471,"We have seen as officers have left and an Uptick on folks being on long-term leave to address medical or other issues, our number is down about 200 from the start of this graph and we look at the past year and that translates to about 300,000 officer hours that the chief does not have to deploy to whatever the need is.",198,,
1199,0.97,8480.471,8489.581,Based on where we are on deployable officers.,198,,
1200,0.97,8489.581,8493.585,We are working to get people back to work but it is part of the broader picture.,198,,
1201,0.97,8493.585,8504.262,Can I ask a question about the deployable numbers?,199,,
1202,0.97,8504.262,8508.666,Yes.,200,,
1203,0.97,8508.666,8511.269,Thank you Dr. Fisher.,201,,
1204,0.97,8511.269,8519.777,I would love a little bit more detail on the drop.,201,,
1205,0.97,8519.777,8535.326,I know you mentioned there are folks who are on mental health leave or on some other kind of medical leave . and I know there was also--I don't know how many of officers who are on disability leave.,201,,
1206,0.97,8535.326,8545.837,Can you walk through that a little bit so we can get an understanding of how many or how long these officers have been on leave and when we may expect them to be back.,201,,
1207,0.97,8545.837,8548.039,We would have to circle back to you with the details.,202,,
1208,0.97,8548.039,8558.549,We have been looking at that.,202,,
1209,0.97,8853.477,8854.245,--,202,,
1210,0.97,8854.245,8861.152,Priority status.,203,,
1211,0.97,8861.152,8866.958,We see the upswing in the number of times we are having to tell people for a lower priority call that no one is coming in right now.,203,,
1212,0.97,8866.958,8870.861,,204,,
1213,0.97,8870.861,8881.472,"As I understand it, we moved to the modified priority call handling policy in July.",205,,
1214,0.97,8881.472,8913.404,And it was described at that time as being part of the of Mo call policy that is an existing policy within the SPD policy and procedures manual.,205,,
1215,0.97,8913.404,8941.933,"The intent originally to reduce officer contact with members of the public for purposes--we would love to know whether or not, given that it started not because as I heard it described, the staffing challenges but the desire to limit the exposure of officers to Covid-19.",205,,
1216,0.97,8941.933,9028.786,"Have there been further changes or further modifications to the priority call status policy after its initiation in July and also I think it would be helpful if it was possible to dig down for the number of priority status days since calling it priority calls for everyone's safety, if it could be done Online or over the phone, led to do it.",205,,
1217,0.97,9028.786,9033.824,If someone and they wanted an officer we were sending been.,205,,
1218,0.97,9033.824,9040.331,This was made with the decision that we cannot safely deploy and address priority 1 and 2 calls.,205,,
1219,0.97,9040.331,9049.507,Because of what is going on . We are not logging those lower priority calls.,205,,
1220,0.97,9049.507,9054.845,They need to call this number and go Online to the portal or call back later.,205,,
1221,0.97,9054.845,9056.18,It is two different Universes of things.,205,,
1222,0.97,9056.18,9069.66,"I don't think we--I don't remember amending minimizing unnecessary interaction, as we continue to try to keep Covid spread at Bay so we can reopen and keep everyone safe.",205,,
1223,0.97,9069.66,9091.615,Two different issues . This I think is really driven by we have lost 200 officers and it is harder to have enough folks on patrol without burning everyone out by bringing them in or Augmentation for overtime to better status.,205,,
1224,0.97,9091.615,9092.616,Minimum call status is really like the floor.,205,,
1225,0.97,9092.616,9096.086,"That is not what we try to staff, that is at the minimum that we can safely handle calls.",205,,
1226,0.97,9096.086,9103.928,In accordance with deployment strategies and a consent decree around multiple officer call types.,205,,
1227,0.97,9103.928,9117.675,And the geographic distribution of certain precincts.,205,,
1228,0.97,9119.543,9120.611,We always hope to have more officers than minimum.,205,,
1229,0.97,9120.611,9129.32,As we have lost 200 officers the minimum staffing days are more frequent and it translates directly into the likelihood of having to go into a priority status day if we have a major event or a high volume of calls.,205,,
1230,0.97,9129.32,9136.427,"Shots fired in a Precinct, especially if someone is hit, it could take four, five, six cars.",205,,
1231,0.97,9136.427,9149.106,With minimum staffing there are very cars . that will probably send the precinct into priority status until shots fired or shooting is cleared up and people can get back to work.,205,,
1232,0.97,9149.106,9155.846,Just to make sure we are thinking of things in a different way.,205,,
1233,0.97,9155.846,9156.747,Or in the correct sort of two buckets.,205,,
1234,0.97,9156.747,9160.451,But we can get you the week by week 420 20.,205,,
1235,0.97,9160.451,9166.257,We can break it out . Madam chair.,205,,
1236,0.97,9166.257,9178.002,We would like to see how the priority status days track against available staffing and as the staffing numbers reduce.,206,,
1237,0.97,9178.002,9184.975,I will go back and look at the order from the chief.,206,,
1238,0.97,9184.975,9203.327,"My recollection is, I did not see a priority status from July and--calls that can be submitted Online or over the phone.",206,,
1239,0.97,9203.327,9212.636,On forced burglary without evidence or calls with no ability for apprehension.,206,,
1240,0.97,9212.636,9222.379,My regulation is that document was activated in July and said it was being done in light of the public health emergency.,206,,
1241,0.97,9222.379,9223.914,"Councilmember, I can answer to that.",207,,
1242,0.97,9223.914,9234.692,We started looking at right when Covid hit we started evaluating all of the calls for service.,207,,
1243,0.97,9234.692,9245.236,Especially the calls for service that we knew there would be no evidence . The suspect information was probably not going to be in existence because say it burglary happened three days ago.,207,,
1244,0.97,9245.236,9245.869,And the person did not know.,207,,
1245,0.97,9245.869,9256.647,"To try to eliminate officers Reponding out to these types of calls for service, we wanted to make sure that we used our Online reporting and are true system.",207,,
1246,0.97,9256.647,9263.52,So we did--that is what we call Covid priority status.,207,,
1247,0.97,9263.52,9269.96,We have been in Covid priority status . I don't remember the day.,207,,
1248,0.97,9269.96,9271.762,"But it is says July, that is probably around that time frame.",207,,
1249,0.97,9271.762,9277.968,I actually think we started a little before that.,207,,
1250,0.97,9277.968,9282.373,Because we had been constantly evaluating a variety of different calls for service.,207,,
1251,0.97,9282.373,9284.341,Not just criminal calls but also traffic accidents as well.,207,,
1252,0.97,9284.341,9299.256,So we have adjusted throughout the whole time that we have been going on.,207,,
1253,0.97,9299.256,9314.171,"What we are speaking to as far as priority 1 and 2, exactly what Dr. Fisher has been discussing, we are on priority status that is usually because of staffing plus some sort of event such as a shooting or some serious level of issue that is requiring a lot more resources and not being able to have that level of resources.",207,,
1254,0.97,9314.171,9325.716,"Just the other day, we had a Homicide and another shooting in two different precincts.",207,,
1255,0.97,9325.716,9326.316,During first watch hours.,207,,
1256,0.97,9326.316,9329.119,That almost depleted our whole first watch officer status.,207,,
1257,0.97,9329.119,9338.228,Those are the impacts when you have two different precincts having big events or big call for service.,207,,
1258,0.97,9338.228,9341.432,And one final point.,208,,
1259,0.97,9341.432,9360.651,"This 2020 number that that happened, I think even in spite of it might be the wrong word, in spite of already having restrictions on the number of calls they were going to, because I think of our staffing.",208,,
1260,0.97,9360.651,9363.887,"Even with the Covid restriction in place, we still had to because of both nature of calls and call volume and the staffing.",208,,
1261,0.97,9363.887,9369.393,We still had to go to priority status this number of times.,208,,
1262,0.97,9369.393,9383.674,"Combined I think it is a patrol force stretched very thin . at least over the second half of the year, if not since March.",208,,
1263,0.97,9383.674,9386.443,Whenever the started.,208,,
1264,0.97,9386.443,9392.382,Thank you.,209,,
1265,0.97,9392.382,9392.883,Historical context.,210,,
1266,0.97,9392.883,9401.492,We will get more granular . Some of this is prior.,210,,
1267,0.97,9401.492,9402.659,We do see three different things.,210,,
1268,0.97,9402.659,9414.071,"Priority 1, many call types can be many different types of priority based on what the call, the caller says.",210,,
1269,0.97,9414.071,9431.989,"And assault can be both a priority 1 or priority 2 or it could be a priority 3. is it happening now, is there a weapon, are you reporting it happened a week ago? it is not so much the name of the call type it is really about what happens and we give some examples.",210,,
1270,0.97,9431.989,9450.941,"The blue line is the median . We tend to go on median because the average can be swayed by, there is a Typo in the graph.",210,,
1271,0.97,9450.941,9451.508,Both of those are median.,210,,
1272,0.97,9451.508,9451.942,The green is not.,210,,
1273,0.97,9451.942,9452.576,"I'm sorry, I got the mixed up.",210,,
1274,0.97,9452.576,9462.619,One is medium and one is average we show those but we tend to go in the median because the average is more swayed by Outliers.,210,,
1275,0.97,9462.619,9466.523,Sometimes officers forget to log when they got to a call and they may just jump out and go.,210,,
1276,0.97,9466.523,9469.259,We don't like to artificially cut Outliers.,210,,
1277,0.97,9469.259,9472.963,It could be real.,210,,
1278,0.97,9472.963,9482.172,We do look at those but we tend to focus on the median which is less susceptible.,210,,
1279,0.97,9482.172,9484.875,We display everything so you see the blue line is the median.,210,,
1280,0.97,9484.875,9488.779,The goal is seven minutes or less.,210,,
1281,0.97,9488.779,9496.92,It was higher early in 2014 and it went down as we had a staffing drive of the prior administration.,210,,
1282,0.97,9496.92,9500.29,And Uptick in 2018. we saw some drops.,210,,
1283,0.97,9500.29,9501.158,2019 and came back down.,210,,
1284,0.97,9501.158,9524.014,"A little bit . not so much when you look at the percentage of calls that got responded to in seven minutes . and you see the large Uptick back to prior levels of the 6.62 and a big drop in the percent of calls responded to within seven minutes . The average shows more of the influence, the tails of the distribution.",210,,
1285,0.97,9524.014,9537.995,"You can see we got up to in 2029.58,--in 2020, 9.58.",210,,
1286,0.97,9538.896,9548.605,"The priority one calls where something is happening to you or a family member or a friend or someone you see, seven minutes probably feels like forever and that extra 2 1/2 minutes feels like an additional forever.",210,,
1287,0.97,9548.605,9555.212,But that has been the historical trend of these numbers.,210,,
1288,0.97,9555.212,9563.02,"And this is looking at specifically 2020, looking at priority 1 and priority 2.",210,,
1289,0.97,9563.02,9568.358,"Priority 1, there is a slight Downtick as Covid set in and general social behavior changes.",210,,
1290,0.97,9568.358,9569.86,We don't have Nightlife.,210,,
1291,0.97,9569.86,9578.068,Not as many people are out and about in daytime . We also have less traffic.,210,,
1292,0.97,9578.068,9589.846,"It is easier for officers to get around, especially the more dense downtown area, which has a higher call volume.",210,,
1293,0.97,9589.846,9603.36,In the North and which has a lot of call volume and has difficult traffic routes to get to as well as the Southwest precinct where sometimes there a longer response times with the difficulty of getting from this precinct down to the bottom of West Seattle.,210,,
1294,0.97,9603.36,9607.798,"Is traffic lessened and is called volume lessened, the response times go down.",210,,
1295,0.97,9607.798,9624.414,"Then you see in June the Uptick in both 1 and 2. the obvious answer is, officers for many days for those having to respond to ongoing demonstrations and protests.",210,,
1296,0.97,9624.414,9635.492,"We don't break it out here but it is something we can provide as a follow-up . When you look at precinct by Precinct, a lot of this is by the East precinct and normally they have a fast response time.",210,,
1297,0.97,9635.492,9651.742,"But with several blocks blocked off and officers deploying out of a different precinct for several weeks, we see a large upswing in response time in the East precinct . which drove a lot of this.",210,,
1298,0.97,9651.742,9652.175,It is maintained.,210,,
1299,0.97,9652.175,9657.447,For seven months the median priority one response time has been above our goal of seven minutes . We saw the historical generally we are below that goal.,210,,
1300,0.97,9657.447,9668.759,Priority 2 is a little harder to Decipher what exactly happened.,210,,
1301,0.97,9668.759,9669.326,We see a large upswing.,210,,
1302,0.97,9669.326,9677.434,"The goal generally, we don't talk about a 15 minute goal that much in these conversations we generally focus on priority one because it is an emergency.",210,,
1303,0.97,9677.434,9701.992,"What you see a large Uptick in priority 2. the thing that makes sense to me, just looking at correlations and trends, if we are in a staffing constraint, if we are going to priority call status, we are stretching ourselves to get to the priority 1 calls.",210,,
1304,0.97,9701.992,9705.328,If we happen to have enough deployable resources they go to the priority 2 calls but they are focused and trying their best to get to the emergency calls.,210,,
1305,0.97,9705.328,9737.727,It makes sense to me that the recovery of the priority 2 calls has been a little bit less back to prior levels than the priority 1 because of the impacts of losing those officers . and reducing our reliance on Augmentation over time because of budget constraints.,210,,
1306,0.97,9737.727,9739.296,We were at minimum staffing a lot and at priority call status a lot.,210,,
1307,0.97,9739.296,9741.498,It priority 2 will suffer more than priority one just by the definition of where we focus resources.,210,,
1308,0.97,9741.498,9742.566,"Dr. Fisher, if you can go back to the slide.",211,,
1309,0.97,9742.566,9754.144,I want to highlight the fact that the text in the box suggest that priority 2 has a seven minute performance metric goal and that is not the case.,211,,
1310,0.97,9754.144,9762.018,I just want to state that for my colleagues in the viewing public.,211,,
1311,0.97,9762.018,9764.821,The priority 2 calls do not have a seven minute performance metric.,211,,
1312,0.97,9764.821,9768.558,They have 15 minutes.,212,,
1313,0.97,9768.558,9768.959,Thank you.,213,,
1314,0.97,9768.959,9770.56,Sorry about that.,213,,
1315,0.97,9770.56,9778.769,Here is another historical thing to put it in context.,213,,
1316,0.97,9778.769,9780.303,Earlier we talked about broader staffing across the whole Department.,213,,
1317,0.97,9780.303,9795.085,Those losses and deployable officer numbers affects the whole Department.,213,,
1318,0.97,9798.054,9799.79,This is specifically looking at the number we have routinely reported to Council.,213,,
1319,0.97,9799.79,9801.525,The officers who are in a patrol car whose primary unit type is a 911 Responder.,213,,
1320,0.97,9801.525,9802.325,Their job is to answer 911 calls.,213,,
1321,0.97,9802.325,9811.001,We looked at the end of each year and we had to pick a point in time.,213,,
1322,0.97,9811.001,9813.37,We picked December 31 of every year and saw how many 911 responders and their sergeants we had.,213,,
1323,0.97,9813.37,9829.853,Part of that increase is through dissent decree we were directed and obligated to increase our Sergeant to officer ratio or decrease it.,213,,
1324,0.97,9829.853,9832.823,A smaller number and more sergeants per officers we had for supervision oversight and review of incidents.,213,,
1325,0.97,9832.823,9836.393,But we also were successful in up staffing.,213,,
1326,0.97,9836.393,9846.203,There you see the 911 response was growing along with supervisors and where we lost staff in 2018 it came down.,213,,
1327,0.97,9846.203,9856.546,"The training to deployment Timeline, 2019 was no better than 2018.",213,,
1328,0.97,9856.546,9863.82,"2020 would be better but then as we had the staffing losses and as we had people not available, you see the number.",213,,
1329,0.97,9863.82,9875.165,The chief made the decision to reassign 100 individuals and a couple of sergeants back to patrol to help plug the hole to make sure we can continue to respond to calls.,213,,
1330,0.97,9875.165,9884.474,We also created the community response group out of that to help us have flexible deployment at her busiest times.,213,,
1331,0.97,9884.474,9891.281,"That was an agreement that was reached, it is not something we can maintain forever.",213,,
1332,0.97,9891.281,9894.05,It is a volunteer basis and people can ask to go back.,213,,
1333,0.97,9894.05,9912.135,It is really a critical element that allowed us to be flexible at her busiest times while we had ongoing protests and demonstrations to not pull 911 away but they have been remarkably helpful at their other primary goal of reducing 911 waiting times.,213,,
1334,0.97,9912.135,9918.308,They have responded to over 1000 dispatches.,213,,
1335,0.97,9918.308,9925.382,At some point those folks will go back . It may be gradual.,213,,
1336,0.97,9925.382,9931.721,And return to where they were before.,213,,
1337,0.97,9931.721,9941.064,"It is a sense of if not for that Reassignment and this Erg which is not permanent, we would be at a remarkably low number of 911 responders.",213,,
1338,0.97,9941.064,9954.978,So the blue box that says 604 with Erg is the 100 or so officers that the chief temporarily redeployed with the consent of the officers being deployed.,214,,
1339,0.97,9954.978,9964.754,The redeployment of patrol was not voluntary.,215,,
1340,0.97,9964.754,9965.322,I am Conflating them.,216,,
1341,0.97,9965.322,9966.423,Joining the Erg team was voluntary.,217,,
1342,0.97,9966.423,9968.725,Got it.,218,,
1343,0.97,9968.725,9979.436,It changes their work additions and different times and that had to be voluntary.,219,,
1344,0.97,9979.436,9980.57,If you didn't want to go through labor negotiations.,219,,
1345,0.97,9980.57,9983.773,So where is the 100 officer redeployment represented here?,220,,
1346,0.97,9983.773,10002.592,"I remember seeing information that showed that when the officers were redeployed to patrol, we actually, for a period of time, had the most number of officers on patrol that we had had for several years.",220,,
1347,0.97,10002.592,10006.896,Can you speak to that?,220,,
1348,0.97,10006.896,10007.464,I will speak to that.,221,,
1349,0.97,10007.464,10012.602,I think it was like 566 or something for a while.,222,,
1350,0.97,10012.602,10020.91,"We actually were at the lowest number of 911 responders, that is the reason for the deployment.",223,,
1351,0.97,10020.91,10022.812,A redeployment of 100 officers back into patrol.,223,,
1352,0.97,10022.812,10037.027,"As we continued to see losses in October, November, December, those were all wiped out very quickly.",223,,
1353,0.97,10037.027,10043.233,"Even that Bob, if we would have not had that bomb of officers coming back into patrol, we would be at devastating numbers.",223,,
1354,0.97,10043.233,10043.733,I understand that.,224,,
1355,0.97,10043.733,10054.811,"My question was that for a time after you did the redeployment of the 100 officers, for a time, I think the number was up around 566 in patrol.",224,,
1356,0.97,10054.811,10058.248,But a number of additional officers left.,224,,
1357,0.97,10058.248,10068.825,I recognize the number now and at the end of 2020 is the lowest it has been.,224,,
1358,0.97,10068.825,10083.74,"But my recollection was when you first did the redeployment, which I think I thank you for doing which was an important thing to do, that the number was actually higher than the number in 2019.",224,,
1359,0.97,10083.74,10084.34,I see Greg raising his hand.,224,,
1360,0.97,10084.34,10089.979,We were closer to about 435 prior to deployment of the 100 officers . In patrol.,225,,
1361,0.97,10089.979,10096.386,That is the reason why I Ctually had to make the decision because we were at such low numbers.,225,,
1362,0.97,10096.386,10109.199,The did not include the bikes and the act team and some other different units that were not necessarily 911 responders.,225,,
1363,0.97,10109.199,10117.574,I have literally pulled all of them together under one under the 911 response.,225,,
1364,0.97,10117.574,10123.313,And that is the level of confusion.,225,,
1365,0.97,10123.313,10132.388,"By moving the 100 officers into patrol, it did not include the act teens and the like teams that were part of those numbers.",225,,
1366,0.97,10132.388,10133.523,There might be just some confusion with the numbers.,225,,
1367,0.97,10133.523,10139.996,We were around 430 range of people that were deployable.,225,,
1368,0.97,10139.996,10142.832,And I will say that also.,225,,
1369,0.97,10142.832,10143.833,That is another thing.,225,,
1370,0.97,10143.833,10146.803,Deployable for patrol.,225,,
1371,0.97,10146.803,10155.178,Because we do have people burning time or taking time away . While they may be initially assigned to patrol they were not deployable for 911 response.,225,,
1372,0.97,10155.178,10158.214,"Greg, do you have something to add?",226,,
1373,0.97,10158.214,10162.085,Just to clarify a little bit.,227,,
1374,0.97,10162.085,10166.456,Basically I will say much of the same thing that the chief just said.,227,,
1375,0.97,10166.456,10175.331,"When the Department talks about patrol they are talking about a group of folks, 911 responders are one part of that group.",227,,
1376,0.97,10175.331,10180.637,"There were other parts of the group . The Anticrime team, Comunity police team.",227,,
1377,0.97,10180.637,10183.273,There are bikes that are patrolling downtown.,227,,
1378,0.97,10183.273,10188.278,Officers on foot.,227,,
1379,0.97,10188.278,10198.121,"When the chief made his move of 100 officers in 2911 response, he moved folks that were already working beats.",227,,
1380,0.97,10198.121,10198.755,Already working on the bikes.,227,,
1381,0.97,10198.755,10211.401,"That were already working out there on patrol, but not answering 911 calls . When he did that there was a bump in 911 responders and folks that were assigned to 911 response.",227,,
1382,0.97,10211.401,10215.572,"Just like you mention, Councilmember Herbold.",227,,
1383,0.97,10215.572,10228.218,But it did not change patrol that much because it was mostly a Reassignment of folks that were already out there in one capacity or another.,227,,
1384,0.97,10228.218,10229.185,They were just not answering 911 calls.,227,,
1385,0.97,10229.185,10232.655,I cannot necessarily speak to availability of officers.,227,,
1386,0.97,10232.655,10233.022,That went down.,227,,
1387,0.97,10233.022,10240.163,I of course understand that 911 responders is a Subset of patrol.,228,,
1388,0.97,10240.163,10245.969,The title of the slide is lowest level of 911 responders but it goes on in the box to talk about patrol.,228,,
1389,0.97,10245.969,10251.641,This is only--this is a chart only of 911 responders.,228,,
1390,0.97,10251.641,10264.087,"The statement about the patrol being short 158 officers is speaking truly to patrol, not specifically 2911.",228,,
1391,0.97,10264.087,10273.162,"Right now with the chiefs Reassignment, patrol, except for maybe one bike squad left, patrol now is exclusively 911.",229,,
1392,0.97,10273.162,10282.538,That was sort of his reorientation . A generalization of patrol officers to do all the work we had specialize when we had better staffing.,229,,
1393,0.97,10282.538,10283.473,Correct.,230,,
1394,0.97,10283.473,10300.957,"All the specialized groups I just mentioned, the act team and the bike team, Cpt, all of that is under the 911 response because of the moves we had to do.",230,,
1395,0.97,10300.957,10302.058,"Madam chair, we can get you a month by month.",231,,
1396,0.97,10302.058,10306.462,I know what you're asking and I just don't have it in my head.,231,,
1397,0.97,10306.462,10306.996,It is not in our deck.,231,,
1398,0.97,10306.996,10308.264,Úwe can show you the month by month count in a follow-up.,231,,
1399,0.97,10308.264,10311.267,Thank you.,232,,
1400,0.97,10311.267,10318.941,"The other point to explain the box, as we have seen, we saw the response time go up as we lost officers.",233,,
1401,0.97,10318.941,10362.852,"Using our Triangulation approach for minimum staffing, Npp program, performance management sort of approach and the sort of operational deployment realities of officer on every beat for some version of community policing, we took what we learned here, applied it to those models and the best we can tells the typically, if we lose an additional 50 patrol officers out of patrol, which is now in essence 911 response, the numbers forecast it would lead to an almost Three-Minute increase in priority 1 response time.",233,,
1402,0.97,10362.852,10367.423,"Speaking to that, we are sort of at the edge of a cliff.",233,,
1403,0.97,10367.423,10377.967,If we go over there starts to be--we saw a 2 1/2 minute Uptick and other conditions happening.,233,,
1404,0.97,10377.967,10383.673,"Here it is making the point that if we continue to lose patrol, it is hard to do another redeployment.",233,,
1405,0.97,10383.673,10402.592,"Even anticipating, not exponential, that may be too strong but we would see a definite further increasing in our response time . There will be little left to fill the gap.",233,,
1406,0.97,10402.592,10422.912,We have lost officers and we are concerned that continued cuts as we have heard may have been driving some of the loss and the fear of being laid off or not having the tools and equipment and training they were used to having.,234,,
1407,0.97,10422.912,10435.892,If we continue to see these cuts it will put us in an even more dire situation than we currently are to meet the sort of two giant buckets of providing adequate police protection across the city.,234,,
1408,0.97,10435.892,10438.828,However we define adequate protection in districts.,234,,
1409,0.97,10438.828,10441.831,And the obligations on the consent decree.,234,,
1410,0.97,10441.831,10450.306,"As mentioned briefly, the monitor and import of DOJ is spelled out.",234,,
1411,0.97,10450.306,10464.42,"A general deployment model, that there are certain call types to decrease the potential for force we must have a certain number of officers and supervisors.",234,,
1412,0.97,10464.42,10475.565,As we reach ever dwindling staffing numbers it stretches our ability to meet that model of deployment and patrol . The chief also mentioned the professional standards Bureau and the training unit.,234,,
1413,0.97,10475.565,10478.768,Almost all of those units have been hit by significant separations.,234,,
1414,0.97,10478.768,10486.676,"As he stated, a large bucket of employees on the sworn side are in patrol.",234,,
1415,0.97,10486.676,10497.82,"I think in the past and this particular unit, it went down low and we would pull folks from patrol when it is better staffed.",234,,
1416,0.97,10497.82,10498.487,It is not possible to do that.,234,,
1417,0.97,10498.487,10499.989,"As we lose individuals from the other units, you cannot Backfill.",234,,
1418,0.97,10499.989,10513.269,"And each of these units, wrapping up a case in bringing justice to a victim and their family is a big part of community engagement and providing the service that people expect . They want the outcome of the case to be decided.",234,,
1419,0.97,10513.269,10525.615,"Collaborative policing, the consent decree speaks dramatically to the importance of a community policing and community engagement model.",234,,
1420,0.97,10525.615,10527.149,We have to invest in our technology and keep it running and evolving.,234,,
1421,0.97,10527.149,10566.255,"I think when you look back into the origins of the consent decree, a large part of the discussion was about our inability to report the data because our systems could not select or Collate it . a new focus of ours is been awareness but more so pushing the Ascension is of focusing on officer wellness and we have had great partnership from Council and CPC and the Oig on the importance of officer wellness and we are working right now on coming up with a best in class early intervention system.",234,,
1422,0.97,10566.255,10567.723,The prior monitor admitted the prior system needed to be improved.,234,,
1423,0.97,10567.723,10585.841,All of the current team is on the same page of pushing this new early intervention system to be one that gets to issues before they turn into problematic behaviors versus one that identifies problematic behaviors is essential.,234,,
1424,0.97,10585.841,10586.442,I will hit this next slide.,234,,
1425,0.97,10586.442,10587.777,Speaking to the technology.,234,,
1426,0.97,10587.777,10608.297,"This is our case for letting us keep this $5.4 million in our budget . These are things that we believe are essential to both the Reimagining work, be more effective and efficient, and the technology aspect.",234,,
1427,0.97,10608.297,10615.404,We could get more detail on the actual specifics of each program.,234,,
1428,0.97,10615.404,10630.72,"But the system we don't but allows us to do reporting, and fueled the operation oversight of the consent decree, it needs to be updated.",234,,
1429,0.97,10630.72,10635.257,We need to move it to the cloud for cost reduction and tie into new and evolving tools that are hard to do on program.,234,,
1430,0.97,10635.257,10636.592,We have that partnership in place.,234,,
1431,0.97,10636.592,10651.64,It will allow us to do--there are Mdeling systems and tools that exist in the environment where we put this and need to make that move.,234,,
1432,0.97,10651.64,10676.732,We have identified a much more agile and User-Friendly and understandable planning tool that ties into the same access to data that would allow us to much more easily forecast scenarios and what that would look like for staffing needs on a public safety measure beyond the black box program we currently have.,234,,
1433,0.97,10676.732,10681.57,Innovation blueprint which is called out in the Mayor's Eeo around Reimagining.,234,,
1434,0.97,10681.57,10694.55,This is really developing a comprehensive across 10 areas that are spoken to both in the Eeo and the SPD letter.,234,,
1435,0.97,10694.55,10697.086,I believe to central staff or maybe the Mayor's office.,234,,
1436,0.97,10697.086,10704.994,We can Reattach that.,234,,
1437,0.97,10704.994,10707.83,"The areas we want to focus on innovation is identifying what we need to do from a technology, training, better practice standpoint.",234,,
1438,0.97,10707.83,10715.404,"To really increase transparency, engagement, with community and be more effective and efficient.",234,,
1439,0.97,10715.404,10721.51,And the improvements and building out the first of its kind early intervention system.,234,,
1440,0.97,10721.51,10731.62,Those technology efforts and Scoping efforts are $2.25 million.,234,,
1441,0.97,10731.62,10736.125,If we can pause here.,235,,
1442,0.97,10736.125,10738.727,I see Council member Lewis come on screen.,235,,
1443,0.97,10738.727,10745.968,I would be interested to understand the investments.,235,,
1444,0.97,10745.968,10755.444,Why this was not included in the proposed 2021 budget?,235,,
1445,0.97,10755.444,10761.417,The nearly $2.2 million in spending.,235,,
1446,0.97,10761.417,10762.284,Angela can speak to some of this.,236,,
1447,0.97,10762.284,10773.863,I know the move to the Dap we thought would not be able to be done for Lolo for no cost in 2020.,236,,
1448,0.97,10773.863,10783.472,External realities between the city it is now something we are going to have to invest a decent amount of money to make that happen.,236,,
1449,0.97,10783.472,10798.654,The Cpt tool was also a late that vacation but this is a tool that existed and we could get access to and connect to our systems.,236,,
1450,0.97,10798.654,10803.392,"And I think the blueprint and the EIS, Angela, I know you put that in your memo.",236,,
1451,0.97,10803.392,10810.599,But I don't know if there were other areas you were thinking in the creation of the 2021 budget.,236,,
1452,0.97,10810.599,10818.274,"Before we moved to Angela, I want to be efficient . Angela may be the person to answer the question.",237,,
1453,0.97,10818.274,10828.751,The memo from 25 January says that gap 1.0 was originally designed to respond to a specific set of requirements under the consent decree.,237,,
1454,0.97,10828.751,10837.526,Since then these cases have grown dramatically as the platform was used to meet increasing for Non-Consent decree related information.,237,,
1455,0.97,10837.526,10870.125,"I am really interested in this proposed spending, weather for the Dap or other technology elements to Parse out which investments are necessary to respond to consent decree requirements from Dap use cases from distinct from meaning Nonconsent decree related information in all of this.",237,,
1456,0.97,10870.125,10881.27,"Just on the Dap, this would be a question I will sound like a lawyer but I am not.",238,,
1457,0.97,10881.27,10882.171,It is the letter versus the spirit.,238,,
1458,0.97,10882.171,10888.744,"Stuff that is not specifically called out to that level in the consent decree in terms of technology, it is the wellness.",238,,
1459,0.97,10888.744,10911.567,The team that manages the Dap is trying to work with our technology partners to do some pretty amazing and cutting edge work around stuff beyond EIS and helping to support and identify and evaluate tools and technology and ways of monitoring how officers are doing . So we can provide support.,238,,
1460,0.97,10911.567,10931.186,I don't know if that by letter of contract would be Dap would be consent decree related but it is something that Dap supports and we think Holistically supports the consent decree.,238,,
1461,0.97,10931.186,10931.72,But Angela can Chime in.,238,,
1462,0.97,10931.72,10940.529,I would say for the most part the items listed weren't known as we were developing the 2020 proposed budget.,239,,
1463,0.97,10940.529,10953.842,"The work, clearly defining the scope of this project and understanding what the potential costs were, these costs were not known when we transmitted the memo in January.",239,,
1464,0.97,10953.842,10969.124,Much of what you see here has been born out of the work under the executive order . and was very much a work in progress.,239,,
1465,0.97,10969.124,10974.763,And was not known to us when we submitted our 2020 budget proposal.,239,,
1466,0.97,10974.763,10988.143,"Some of the upgrades for the data ANALYTICS platform were known and as Chris said, I believe there were funds available for some of those updates.",239,,
1467,0.97,10988.143,10990.546,Were just I am updates.,239,,
1468,0.97,10990.546,10995.384,I believe that may have been built into the Seattle it rates.,239,,
1469,0.97,10995.384,11013.502,"However due to Covid and the challenges with implementation of some of the ongoing project work in Seattle it, it was postponed and the funding was not rendered in 2021.",239,,
1470,0.97,11013.502,11027.116,I just want to emphasize a point and maybe cheap Ds can speak more to it.,240,,
1471,0.97,11027.116,11048.537,"A point that Angela just made which is part of the some of these items also illustrate the given the unprecedented staffing losses through the fourth quarter, we are also identifying strategies to help mitigate those impacts and some of these items are based on some of that thinking to adjust to the staffing challenges that emerge for SPD.",240,,
1472,0.97,11048.537,11049.805,I know Dr. Fisher and Angela have spoken to some of that.,240,,
1473,0.97,11049.805,11050.639,If cheap Ds has anything to add?,240,,
1474,0.97,11050.639,11053.642,It is an important point to emphasize.,240,,
1475,0.97,11053.642,11058.447,Thank you.,241,,
1476,0.97,11058.447,11077.466,We are constantly trying to evaluate and adjust what tools can make us more efficient so we are able to meet some of the demands that are being requested in 2021 with the staffing crisis we are experiencing.,241,,
1477,0.97,11077.466,11085.374,"The thing about the 2021 budget development, we were facing a significant financial crisis in 2020.",242,,
1478,0.97,11085.374,11086.008,Resources were not abounding.,242,,
1479,0.97,11086.008,11091.98,It was built to provide resources needed to fund staffing that we understood then.,242,,
1480,0.97,11091.98,11100.489,Staffing has since obviously fallen off relative to those forecasts . We were not in any position to entertain this in anyone's budget.,242,,
1481,0.97,11100.489,11106.128,And the political climate and least of all SPD.,242,,
1482,0.97,11106.128,11112.101,I think that is an important reality for members as well.,242,,
1483,0.97,11112.101,11122.611,Any other comments before we move on?,243,,
1484,0.97,11122.611,11123.111,Council member Lewis.,243,,
1485,0.97,11123.111,11123.679,Thank you Madam chair.,244,,
1486,0.97,11123.679,11127.115,As long as we are here on the technology slide I wanted to raise and see if it fits in the four corners.,244,,
1487,0.97,11127.115,11134.823,We are talking about reporting and call responsiveness.,244,,
1488,0.97,11134.823,11145.501,Frequent constituent work in my office tends to revolve around complications and being able to report things Online.,244,,
1489,0.97,11145.501,11147.102,Which is something a lot of people have found to be very difficult.,244,,
1490,0.97,11147.102,11155.911,They have found the program and form where you fill things into be difficult.,244,,
1491,0.97,11155.911,11183.238,They have been bumped from that system because sometimes a crime does not fit within it and they have to physically call the Hotline to report . In addition to that people have had issues transmitting evidence . I've got a lot of constituents that will have surveillance footage of someone who stole their package or who stole something out of their business . and they just cannot for the life of them transmit.,244,,
1492,0.97,11183.238,11188.577,There is no way to Upload it.,244,,
1493,0.97,11188.577,11193.782,These are not sophisticated or large data videos in a lot of cases.,244,,
1494,0.97,11193.782,11195.417,We should in this day and age be able to electronically submit that.,244,,
1495,0.97,11195.417,11199.188,That kind of evidence.,244,,
1496,0.97,11199.188,11223.579,"I wonder what a lot of these investments, this $2.25 million of investments, where there may be some way to address the streamlining and effectiveness of the Online reporting so people can follow their reports and can also submit evidence to help the Department resolve these kinds of cases.",244,,
1497,0.97,11223.579,11225.347,Thank you Council member Lewis.,245,,
1498,0.97,11225.347,11232.387,Two quick answers and we can talk more in detail.,245,,
1499,0.97,11232.387,11239.828,"One, a large part of the innovation blueprint is identifying the Technologies.",245,,
1500,0.97,11239.828,11256.245,One part of this that our partner has done in other jurisdictions is a community member portal that is more interactive so you don't necessarily have to get someone on the line to have your question answered were to complete your task.,245,,
1501,0.97,11256.245,11300.956,"We are also, the portal that is used for Online reporting is almost right now one of the only existing providers in almost every jurisdiction I am aware of . But totally have heard from the community the frustration and we have had our own sort of Backend complications at times . We have actually pushed our records management vendor, they are building out the front and so the community can report in that system as we have seen in the implementation of that software, it was a tremendous leap forward in usability and User-Friendliness for our officers that are working with the system.",245,,
1502,0.97,11300.956,11306.395,I would imagine you would see the same sort of modern architecture for a community member.,245,,
1503,0.97,11306.395,11324.913,"And through one of our other vendor around the body one camera, they are experts in Video, they have a solution that we are exploring and implementing where folks could submit in a much more easier way their Digital evidence.",245,,
1504,0.97,11324.913,11350.305,But it speaks to these tools are out there and some are being developed . We want to make sure that we are aware of the options and that would be engaging vendors and making sure that we are doing it in a way that is in alignment with the values and ordinances of the city and the surveillance ordinance . that is why we think that part is essential.,245,,
1505,0.97,11350.305,11363.919,"The rest of this work on this page, really is the Dap . The city invested a tremendous amount of funds to set up the Dap to support the consent decree.",245,,
1506,0.97,11363.919,11367.255,And it has to continue to be upgraded.,245,,
1507,0.97,11367.255,11375.964,Its visualization partner continues to evolve and we have to keep it in pace with the rest of technology.,245,,
1508,0.97,11375.964,11386.541,A lot of this is moving forward and it is adding new data sources so we can more easily respond to Council data requests.,245,,
1509,0.97,11386.541,11389.478,Upgrading our technology helps us to provide information to everyone.,245,,
1510,0.97,11389.478,11394.883,In a more streamlined way.,245,,
1511,0.97,11394.883,11404.593,"And also can help us as we develop new technologies for community engagement, we need to make sure we can pull the data in.",245,,
1512,0.97,11404.593,11423.912,It is an Ecosystem I hear you that we need to make our drive needs to be on engagement with the community and it is as seamless and friendly as possible.,245,,
1513,0.97,11423.912,11424.946,The blueprint identifies all the opportunities.,245,,
1514,0.97,11424.946,11437.526,And the other work SETS us up on a foundation to connect all the tools . very easy to engage.,245,,
1515,0.97,11448.403,11449.504,Before we start investing in deciding how this works.,245,,
1516,0.97,11449.504,11454.643,We want to make sure we thought about all conditions.,245,,
1517,0.97,11454.643,11460.715,Thank you.,246,,
1518,0.97,11460.715,11475.263,"2021 adopted budget, there is included a $4.1 million cut to the personal budget for civilian positions.",247,,
1519,0.97,11475.263,11484.973,In order to achieve this savings we need to maintain a minimum of 40 civilian vacancies throughout the year.,247,,
1520,0.97,11484.973,11490.779,This is the Tessa taking the continuation of a civilian hiring freeze at SPD.,247,,
1521,0.97,11490.779,11498.887,Since July of last year we have limited the hiring of civilian positions to 12 positions.,247,,
1522,0.97,11498.887,11511.7,"Three in OPA, seven police Dispatchers, one advisor position, a girls initiative and one grant funded position.",247,,
1523,0.97,11511.7,11516.805,We would like to use the salary Savings and higher positions listed here.,247,,
1524,0.97,11516.805,11524.312,"If not for the pending legislation, it is likely we would have already fill these positions.",247,,
1525,0.97,11524.312,11539.427,Some of them--there is interest in hiring in the public facing positions.,247,,
1526,0.97,11539.427,11561.249,Which could potentially help with the staffing shortage or help address the staffing deficit my take away from the budget discussions last fall was Council wanted to have more visibility into the internal budget decisions.,247,,
1527,0.97,11561.249,11565.554,"I cannot predict how this year will play out but there are known budget needs, which I outlined in the January budget memo to central staff.",247,,
1528,0.97,11565.554,11607.395,"This is an example of wanting to highlight ways we might Repurpose savings in our budget in order to make hires, civilian hires or to respond to and anticipated events like a sworn staffing doesn't fit we are hoping to redirect some of the savings to the hiring what we deemed to be critical civilian positions.",247,,
1529,0.97,11609.164,11620.408,"Second, as far as pay goes, the budget Paintball is around $3 million in 2020.",247,,
1530,0.97,11620.408,11626.815,We mitigate that through vacancies Savings and heavily restricting purposes and over time.,247,,
1531,0.97,11626.815,11639.728,Additional budget cuts stopped us from closing the budget gap.,247,,
1532,0.97,11639.728,11645.233,2020 we developed a rough estimate of the budget need for this year.,247,,
1533,0.97,11645.233,11646.167,The estimate is based on normal attrition.,247,,
1534,0.97,11646.167,11652.474,"If we separate more officers than estimated, we will need an additional appropriation.",247,,
1535,0.97,11652.474,11659.047,Normally we would use vacancies savings to offset the cost.,247,,
1536,0.97,11659.047,11674.963,"When officers separate, the salary savings derived from the separation may be insufficient to cover the cost . depending on the length of service . I just wanted to highlight this.",247,,
1537,0.97,11674.963,11678.166,The separation pay issue.,247,,
1538,0.97,11678.166,11682.17,This is a known issue.,247,,
1539,0.97,11682.17,11711.299,"We saw it impact our budget balancing last year and I wanted to highlight early on that this will be Impactful and we will either need to seek an additional appropriation to build this into the budget because of the uncertainty around how many officers will leave this year, it would be great to have an opportunity to continue to track this and potentially true it up at your end.",247,,
1540,0.97,11711.299,11724.312,Alternatively we could submit a preparation requests in the second quarter supplemental or potentially have some of the $5.4 million left in our budget to address the budget shortfall.,247,,
1541,0.97,11724.312,11733.721,I am open to discussing that in the best way to achieve the closing of this budget gap.,247,,
1542,0.97,11733.721,11741.096,With that I will pass it back to Chris.,248,,
1543,0.97,11741.096,11741.963,Where you going to take this slide?,248,,
1544,0.97,11741.963,11745.133,I think the chief will make some conclusions.,249,,
1545,0.97,11745.133,11756.644,I know there might be some questions so I want to emphasize some final points . In this presentation.,250,,
1546,0.97,11756.644,11764.352,I know there are concerns about departments use of overtime and we are not proposing to use this money for over time.,250,,
1547,0.97,11764.352,11776.664,"If there are additional deployment needs, if the special events return, we will have to come back because that was part of the overtime funding that was cut.",250,,

1552,0.97,11812.867,11816.437,That we can hire a record number of officers building off our earlier success but it will take months for them to be ready and to fill the spots that we have lost.,250,,
1553,0.97,11816.437,11820.575,And this will not matter if officers continue to leave.,250,,
