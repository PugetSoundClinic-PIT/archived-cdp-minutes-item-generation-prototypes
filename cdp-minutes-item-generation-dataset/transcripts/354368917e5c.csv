176,0.97,1084.283,1094.893,"It is related to lifting a proviso of $170,000 that has been placed on the Seattle civil rights.",27,,
177,0.97,1094.893,1105.571,To help fund the efforts to create a work group to help us work together as a city.,27,,
178,0.97,1105.571,1110.509,To make recommendations for the criminal legal system.,27,,
179,0.97,1110.509,1117.015,This is a continuation of work that we began last year.,27,,
180,0.97,1117.015,1140.639,"Both central staff, as well as Soc are have been making good progress towards the goals and the release of this money will allow Socr to start doing some of the external Stakeholder work that is related to the criminal justice reform work.",27,,
181,0.97,1140.639,1145.811,"Then, finally, the budget items that I have for budget committee today.",28,,
182,0.97,1145.811,1147.446,Just a couple of them here.,28,,
183,0.97,1147.446,1154.253,The first is amendment 27 two Council built 1198 18.,28,,
184,0.97,1154.253,1161.26,That relates to the transfer of victim advocates from Sbd to the human services Department.,28,,
185,0.97,1161.26,1163.862,Council voted to do so.,28,,
186,0.97,1163.862,1179.978,"It would impact 11 FTE who work in that division providing support to victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, and vulnerable populations such as victims of elder or child abuse.",28,,
187,0.97,1179.978,1188.287,"We have since learned that in order to ensure a seamless provision of services, Hsd needs to make arrangements around data access.",28,,
188,0.97,1188.287,1193.492,They take a little bit more time than we had anticipated under the earlier versions of the budget actions.,28,,
189,0.97,1193.492,1212.01,"Therefore, I'm going to do sponsoring an amendment that makes the transfer itself contingent on the ability of victim advocates to access from within the human services departments information that is held by the Sbd Rms system.",28,,
190,0.97,1212.01,1220.485,"The King County Ingress system, or any other system that provides the information necessary for victim advocates to perform their work.",28,,
191,0.97,1220.485,1236.001,"This is the recommendation of central staff, to again, to make sure that the transfer happens in a way that allows the victim advocates to continue to do their work.",28,,
192,0.97,1236.001,1245.544,I also have an amendment related to the Council's vote on the command staff salary proviso.,29,,
193,0.97,1245.544,1269.968,"The amendment itself would reduce the chief's salary to $275,000 a year instead of how we voted last week, to move the chief's salary to the very bottom of the pay band, which is $185,000 per year.",29,,
194,0.97,1269.968,1276.375,You all voted for what is essentially more than a 40% pay reduction.,29,,
195,0.97,1276.375,1282.28,"The chief currently has a salary of $294,000 a year.",29,,
196,0.97,1282.28,1288.387,"She is currently the third- highest Department head, highest-paid Department head in the city.",29,,
197,0.97,1288.387,1294.593,"Moving her down to the lowest of her pay band, would mean she would be the second lowest paid Department head.",29,,
198,0.97,1294.593,1301.4,Despite managing nearly 2200 full-time employees.,29,,
199,0.97,1301.4,1306.705,As compared to 65 full-time employees in the Department of neighborhoods.,29,,
200,0.97,1306.705,1328.026,"And the director of the Department of neighborhoods, if the boat that we passed last week went forward, the director of the Department of neighborhoods would be the only Department head paid less in the entire city than the police chief.",29,,
201,0.97,1328.026,1340.505,"It's important to recognize not only does teeth best manage the largest Department in terms of full-time employees, it is larger than S.Or either utility.",29,,
202,0.97,1340.505,1351.75,I am sure that we all remember after a natural search and first being passed over by the selection team.,29,,
203,0.97,1351.75,1354.152,She was awarded the job after the community rallied to support her.,29,,
204,0.97,1354.152,1358.523,She became the first black woman chief of the Seattle police Department.,29,,
205,0.97,1358.523,1368.467,"In doing so, received competitive pay.",29,,
206,0.97,1368.467,1372.871,There is room for debate about whether or not the chief's salary should be exempted entirely from the Council's action last week.,29,,
207,0.97,1372.871,1377.476,"I have some thoughts about that, and I know also some will oppose this amendment.",29,,
208,0.97,1377.476,1385.851,I will hold my remarks on both of those other positions until debate this afternoon.,29,,
209,0.97,1385.851,1418.784,"Lastly, just want to lift up in my capacity as public safety and human services committee chair, that we have heard the office of the inspector general talking about her commitment to a Community-Based investigation of the events following the George Floyd protests . Speaking of the events related to policing protests.",30,,
210,0.97,1418.784,1432.931,"So, the inspector general has made an announcement that they are moving forward with the sentinel event review, and has begun to solicit community input for that review.",30,,
211,0.97,1432.931,1444.242,"The sentinel review itself is a systems based root cause analysis of incidents with significant negative outcome, that is of importance and concern to community.",30,,
212,0.97,1444.242,1451.316,The goal of the review is systemic improvement that it addresses institutionalized racism.,30,,
213,0.97,1451.316,1461.56,"They are doing a virtual community listening for him for those who want to share their perspectives on Thursday, August 13th, from 9:30 to 11:00.",30,,
214,0.97,1461.56,1472.537,"For more information, or to provide comment, you can Email sentinel event at Seattle.Gov, or go to Seattle.Gov/Oig, /Committee.",30,,
215,0.97,1472.537,1478.543,"Lastly, just want to flag a couple of events this week.",30,,
216,0.97,1478.543,1490.689,Firefighter pension board this week as well as I am chairing the watershed resource inventory area . that meeting is on Thursday.,30,,
217,0.97,1490.689,1495.293,Last week we had another meeting of the West Seattle bridge community task force.,30,,
218,0.97,1495.293,1506.505,"This week, I'm hoping to be able to participate in the local progress virtual convening beginning Thursday evening and going through Saturday.",30,,
219,0.97,1506.505,1510.909,Thank you.,30,,
220,0.97,1510.909,1541.039,"Thank you, Councilmember I did not vote to cut the cat salary of the chief noted Councilmembers.",30,,
221,0.97,1541.039,1544.109,I just wanted to get that on the record.,30,,
222,0.97,1544.109,1544.509,Thank you.,30,,
223,0.97,1544.509,1552.05,Any other questions or comments?,31,,
224,0.97,1552.05,1568.333,Does anyone have a report for Councilmember Juarez?,31,,
225,0.97,1569.634,1571.77,"Seeing none, we will have Council member Louis report out.",31,,
226,0.97,1571.77,1572.37,Thank you.,32,,
227,0.97,1572.37,1583.682,I think I can take a bunch of advantages from the report earlier to make this brief.,32,,
228,0.97,1583.682,1593.858,I don't want to lobby anyone for passing the legislation.,32,,
229,0.97,1593.858,1621.72,Councilmember Herbold did a great job and I just want to thank staff are doing with the law Department and sending those our way and hopefully we will especially pass these moments this afternoon and strengthen that law which just to remind the general public and everyone here is currently providing relief for a county workers that are getting that consideration for the important and critical work they do.,32,,
230,0.97,1621.72,1633.498,Let's make sure we keep that strong Bypassing these amendments.,32,,
231,0.97,1633.498,1694.259,"Moving on to the resolution that Councilmember Herbold alluded to, I want to thank her for her leadership and I also want to provide an update that Councilmember Juarez has updated us and she did provide a considerable amount of additional content to the resolution and it was good to work with her office over the course of the last week as well as a number of other offices in shaping and molding the content of this critical resolution about putting together a new Department of public health and safety and violence prevention that will take on many of the roles that we are looking to protect and enhance and expand that our Community-Based from outside of the traditional armed police thing.",32,,
232,0.97,1694.259,1718.483,That resolution has been distributed and I look forward to discussing that today and providing a roadmap on how to do things differently and work with community to make sure we are sending the appropriate first Responder to situations.,32,,
233,0.97,1718.483,1720.618,That warrants a different kind of approach than traditional armed police.,32,,
234,0.97,1720.618,1741.539,"Also, elements in the resolution that are requesting additional analysis and reporting from the police Department on how a smaller police Department would have a role and context of this new Department of public safety to Prioritize the 911 calls.",32,,
235,0.97,1741.539,1761.926,Acts of violence and other criminal activity that was still arm of warned response under the new system of public safety.,32,,
236,0.97,1761.926,1775.507,Some reformed components as well including a Database of complaints and that they like the process in line with national best practices that are being promoted in other jurisdictions.,32,,
237,0.97,1775.507,1788.353,I do want to transition briefly and I would assure this last week but I know we had brief briefings in light of the busy agenda.,32,,
238,0.97,1788.353,1805.47,I do just want to share that I was visited by the everyday March a week and a half ago.,32,,
239,0.97,1806.838,1809.474,I went down to greet them and we had a very cordial exchange.,32,,
240,0.97,1809.474,1815.28,I want to say that I was very impressed by the young people that were facilitating the conversation and leading the discussion.,32,,
241,0.97,1815.28,1822.82,We have actually had a considerable amount of Follow- up since then and they have consulted on the resolution that we are submitting today.,32,,
242,0.97,1822.82,1850.648,"I think the everyday Marchers as Councilmembers Peterson and Strauss and Councilmember Herbold could probably talk about with the good conversations of the direction that the city needs to take and Revisiting our system of public safety and overall system of policing and undoubtedly, the next generation of leaders has a critical voice in this discussion.",32,,
243,0.97,1850.648,1878.876,I was troubled to hear that in summit County when the everyday Marchers attempted to have a conversation with chief best and I can't speak to the exact situation on the ground but I have seen disturbing images of the same young people that came to my stoop being approached with firearms.,32,,
244,0.97,1878.876,1927.025,"Based on my interaction with them and my conversation with them, it saddened me to see these young people, some of them are just out of high school or are still in high school and they are being confronted with such overt threats of violence by people when based on my experience, they just wanted to have a conversation about the future of these policy shifts that we are debating around public safety and I just want to say for all leaders be us here at the city council or the folks in the Department or in the state legislator or any level of government, I think these young people and the views they are expressing should be greeted by open ears and not open carry.",32,,
245,0.97,1927.025,1958.356,That is something we need to take forward with us and we need to say--is something where we shouldn't be ignorant to the fact that there have been certain acts that have been tangential to some of the Protester have been disturbing including comments at Councilmember Pedersen and others and I don't think that rounds the movement down to something where people should be confronting them with firearms.,32,,
246,0.97,1958.356,1982.88,"As we are all moving forward and having these conversations, responding with open ears instead of force will be critical to the healing process necessary to reach the common understanding and I look forward to continuing to work with the everyday Marchers and I would condemn any effort to approach them with any kind of intimidation and threat of force.",32,,
247,0.97,1982.88,1989.721,"Really, my experience, they just wanted to talk and we actually had a good conversation.",32,,
248,0.97,1989.721,1999.297,"With that, Madam President, I don't have any other updates and I can turn it back over to you.",32,,
249,0.97,1999.297,1999.63,Thank you.,32,,
250,0.97,1999.63,2000.298,Thank you.,33,,
251,0.97,2000.298,2006.07,Any comments or questions on that report?,33,,
252,0.97,2006.07,2011.976,"Hearing none, we will now hear from Councilmember Morales.",33,,
253,0.97,2011.976,2021.519,"Before we do that, Councilmember Herbold, just a quick note that you are not on mute just in case.",33,,
254,0.97,2021.519,2023.921,There we go.,33,,
255,0.97,2023.921,2024.522,Councilmember Morales.,33,,
256,0.97,2024.522,2025.123,Thank you.,34,,
257,0.97,2025.123,2033.131,I will be brief and I thank Councilmember Lewis for those remarks.,34,,
258,0.97,2033.131,2039.937,Many of us have had those experiences and are feeling extraordinary uncomfortable with people being met with guns so thank you for that.,34,,
259,0.97,2039.937,2042.407,I will try to be brief here.,34,,
260,0.97,2042.407,2068.833,"Last Friday, we Rebooted the constituent office hours and we have a meeting with constituents and heard from folks about utility issues they are having and I also did meet with the Columbia city farmers market and I know the Association is reaching out to many of us.",34,,
261,0.97,2068.833,2087.485,My commitment is to work with them on how best to support the operations of the farmers markets because they are Nonprofits but it is also about supporting small businesses and some prepared food although those can't operate right now.,34,,
262,0.97,2087.485,2110.208,We need to make sure that we are supporting the work of these associations as small businesses themselves and the local small farm businesses that are operating and are really important links to providing access to the local healthy Foods for our constituents.,34,,
263,0.97,2110.208,2122.42,"There will be more conversation, I'm sure with all involved but that was an limiting conversation.",34,,
264,0.97,2122.42,2130.928,"Regarding the budget, we have to amend Council bill 119-5825.",34,,
265,0.97,2130.928,2151.215,59 and 56 provide $14 million to community led public safety through a loan to get money into the community now and scale up as we begin the journey of figuring out how to restructure the Department.,34,,
266,0.97,2151.215,2161.459,We have had weeks of negotiations with black community led organizations and the idea is to have organizations that are doing this work.,34,,
267,0.97,2161.459,2187.985,"These amendments reflect that intent but I want to point out that once again, we are running into structural barriers with our intent and as we learned over the weekend that I-200 prevents the city from intentional efforts as we understand it from contracting directly or stating that we must contract that based on recent gender.",34,,
268,0.97,2187.985,2209.173,"We are working on this and we will discuss this more this afternoon to let folks know about that effort and then as mentioned, by Councilmember Herbold, we have 118939 four $170,000 to the office of civil rights.",34,,
269,0.97,2209.173,2233.864,This is for criminal legal system work that is intending to better coordinate and align the efforts of the many initiatives and Workgroups and different things that have been created over the years and the goal is to eliminate the work that these efforts are undergoing.,34,,
270,0.97,2233.864,2252.483,Especially as the impact communities of color who are repeatedly asked for meetings or surveys or community engagement which puts a huge burden on community to participate in this work even though they want to be involved.,34,,
271,0.97,2252.483,2269.1,The criminal legal system work is intended to do an assessment of all the different initiatives that have been in place and figure out how best to coordinate them and align them so that can be a more unified effort to do the community engagement we want to see.,34,,
272,0.97,2269.1,2276.374,That is what is on deck for this afternoon and that is all I have.,34,,
273,0.97,2276.374,2277.174,Thank you.,35,,
274,0.97,2277.174,2281.479,Any questions or comments on that report?,35,,
275,0.97,2281.479,2298.696,"Hearing none, we will now hear from Councilmember Mosqueda and that I will close out this morning's Council briefing so we can get started on the soft budget meeting.",35,,
276,0.97,2298.696,2300.297,"Thank you very much, Council President.",36,,
277,0.97,2300.297,2305.703,Today I'm looking forward to bringing forward the resolution that has already been discussed in today's briefing along with some of my colleagues.,36,,
278,0.97,2305.703,2311.175,Thank you very much counselor Peterson.,36,,
279,0.97,2311.175,2323.587,This is a resolution to protect journalists and legal observers and medics to make sure folks are safe and free from harm or targeting so that they can do their jobs.,36,,
280,0.97,2323.587,2333.531,"As reported, increasingly journalists have had additional reasons to fear for their physical safety when covering events like protests.",36,,
281,0.97,2333.531,2352.349,"Given the information we've received and the data we have seen over the last three years, protests have become increasingly dangerous on the Jobsite for journalists working in the United States over the last three years.",36,,
282,0.97,2352.349,2379.977,"Also, much of the violence comes from police committing acts of violence and sometimes from protesters as well that are lashing out and we know with the SPD and the ongoing litigation that is pushing or selling a journalist to hand over their videos and photos, increases the risk that individuals will see members of the media as extensions of the government and of the police and this puts their safety at risk as well.",36,,
283,0.97,2379.977,2400.064,We have amended the resolution I sent over the weekend to reflect some of the changes that we would like to highlight including from law to make sure folks are not being put in a position of danger when they are trying to provide medical relief or legal observers or we journalists.,36,,
284,0.97,2400.064,2406.67,We have sing national images of reporters being harassed at rallies and news crews not being able to cover the protest.,36,,
285,0.97,2406.67,2422.887,"We want to make sure that journalists have the protections they need and that would take away any misunderstanding from the press--sorry, from the public with the extension of the city or the city.",36,,
286,0.97,2422.887,2448.212,"The revolution asks for our city to pull back on the lawsuit that is pushing for these materials and I am again asking our Mayor to withdraw the lawsuit and through this resolution, we continue to emphasize the importance of this and only for protection of the free press and medics and legal observers but also ensuring the health and safety of people as they are continuing to cover the protests.",36,,
287,0.97,2448.212,2453.35,Thanks again to the cosponsors and I look forward to your vote on this later today.,36,,
288,0.97,2453.35,2470.968,"Also, I want to highlight my anticipation for the Wednesday conversation which will be the Jumpstart relief funds and these are funds that are offering support for rental assistance and food assistance and child care assistance.",36,,
289,0.97,2470.968,2481.979,"We will also be advancing $200,000 to implement the Jumpstart payroll attacks.",36,,
290,0.97,2481.979,2502.366,"Again, we will be Replenishing these reserves and I think that is really important to mention and has been somewhat lost in the conversation from the executive's office and completely omitted that the reserves we are talking about using will be replenished in full and added to when we have Jumpstart relief that goes into effect.",36,,
291,0.97,2502.366,2511.609,We will be Replenishing our rainy day and emergency funds with the payroll taxes are to come in.,36,,
292,0.97,2511.609,2536.0,"Last week, Danny Wesley wrote despite the Panama, venture capitalists are Pouringmoney into Tech companies that fund the & amp; level of this comes from a report recently citing that the largest deal was the biggest in local Tech deals ever and was last month at a firm headquartered in Seattle.",36,,
293,0.97,2536.0,2547.411,This is an opportunity for us to right size the economy and asked those that are doing well and especially during the time of Covid when so many families are being kicked out of their homes and are able to put food on the table.,36,,
294,0.97,2547.411,2553.684,Let's make sure that those that are doing extremely well help our economy recover in the long run.,36,,
295,0.97,2553.684,2562.359,We know people are paying rent with credit cards and the checks are continuing to disappear.,36,,
296,0.97,2562.359,2575.572,We know the $600 has now dried up and people are expressing record high means well food blanks are recording record long weeks and the need for food is dire.,36,,
297,0.97,2575.572,2589.853,This is an opportunity for us to recognize that unless we step in and provide relief for families and small businesses and Childcare which we know that about 30% will not open if they don't get additional assistance.,36,,
298,0.97,2589.853,2604.201,This is the time for us to step in as families and small businesses are looking for ways to have their kids cared for and the Jumpstart relief provides an opportunity.,36,,
299,0.97,2604.201,2620.517,"Today, I will just briefly summarize that we have the final budget committee right after the Council briefing and we will continue at the beginning of the meeting to talk about potential legislation related to the budget and we will take that in the following order.",36,,
300,0.97,2620.517,2633.23,"First, the budget revisions and in the Federal Crf and second- quarter second medal in 2020 grant exceptions and 2019 exceptions.",36,,
301,0.97,2633.23,2645.042,We will also have the resolution that I believe Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Lewis clearly described which provides a one- year budgeting outlook and sort of a Visioning document for 2021.,36,,
302,0.97,2645.042,2650.014,I know there will be several amendments today and some have already noted them.,36,,
303,0.97,2650.014,2657.421,I will ask folks just to remind us if they have been renewed by law.,36,,
304,0.97,2657.421,2667.264,I will be asking to make sure the steps have been taken and we appreciate any comments you may have as well about anything that has been done.,36,,
305,0.97,2667.264,2674.238,"Afterwards, we will move these bills out of our committee and we hope to have a final vote in full counsel.",36,,

309,0.97,2697.261,2698.195,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",37,,

313,0.97,2708.205,2712.176,Two questions and one regarding the resolution supporting the process.,38,,
314,0.97,2712.176,2732.429,"You Referenced your position about the city's lawsuits and is not Referenced as a position in the revolution and if not, do you think there is time to consider including supporting that position?",38,,
315,0.97,2732.429,2737.434,It's one I share strongly.,38,,
316,0.97,2737.434,2771.869,"Secondly, given the fact that we just received late breaking news about the third-quarter supplemental revenues from the budget director, I'm just wondering and I know we haven't had much time to think about it but I'm wondering are we intending to have a conversation about how to address that additional shortfall as it relates to the Jumpstart veto override?",38,,
317,0.97,2771.869,2782.78,It seems like we should consider what exactly it is that we are going to override given this new news.,38,,
318,0.97,2782.78,2790.487,"Before you answer, it is now 10:20.",39,,
319,0.97,2790.487,2808.806,"I would be happy to have you answer the first question but if we can put the second question about budget related bills and the recent correspondence we received from the state budget office to the select budget committee, I think that would be wise.",39,,
320,0.97,2808.806,2826.723,"If we get into the first question, we will consider that this afternoon and put the second question related to Jumpstart and the additional revenue issues to select budget, that would be appreciated.",39,,

322,0.97,2832.329,2832.93,Happy to address it.,40,,
323,0.97,2832.93,2858.355,"On the first question about the lawsuit that the city is advancing, I guess against members of the press, it is included in the resolution and is of the Council request enforcement of the subpoena so the city can strongly protect the press.",40,,
324,0.97,2858.355,2872.603,I think that is still important even though we know they have gone through one and I appreciate and applaud members of the press and their entities that are appealing that so it is still ongoing and that is included in the section for you.,40,,

330,0.97,2884.548,2887.017,As though there could be any more.,43,,
