33,0.97,133.399,140.507,"The next meeting will be at its regularly scheduled time tomorrow, Tuesday, may 25th at 2:00 P.M.",11,,
34,0.97,140.507,146.212,Tomorrow's committee will discuss three rental rights bill and we hope to vote on all three of the committee members are willing to do so.,11,,
35,0.97,146.212,164.063,"There will be four potential votes to ban the school year Evictions of children, their families and educators, which the committee has discussed for the passed two meetings.",11,,
36,0.97,164.063,169.569,"I have repeatedly asked members of the committee to let my office know of any concerns or amendments, and I have not heard any so far.",11,,
37,0.97,169.569,179.846,I'll again appeal to any Councilmembers who are in the committee who have questions or concerns or amendments to please share them with my office so that we can work on those.,11,,
38,0.97,179.846,184.984,"As I reported earlier, the Seattle education Association's representative assembly passed a resolution supporting this legislation by an overwhelming majority vote.",11,,
39,0.97,184.984,193.626,I have had communication with the Seattle education President who has expressed support for the bill on behalf of the membership.,11,,
40,0.97,193.626,207.507,There will also be four potential vote legislation from Councilmember Sawant' office creating a further defense for efficient for rental debts during the Covid-19 emergency.,11,,
41,0.97,207.507,210.41,I support this legislation as chair of the committee and I am a cosponsor.,11,,
42,0.97,210.41,215.215,Councilmember Morales who is its prime sponsor will be describing it in more detail.,11,,
43,0.97,215.215,228.094,"Finally, there will be for potential vote legislation that Councilmember Morales' office in my office are jointly sponsored up to create a right of first refusal for Renters on fixed term leases.",11,,
44,0.97,228.094,244.911,"Both our offices had previously introduced draft legislation to address what I have called the fixed term lease loophole in the just cause Eviction ordinance, which effectively allows landlords to refuse to renew a Renter's lease for no reason whatsoever.",11,,
45,0.97,244.911,247.347,This issue has been discussed for the passed three committee meetings.,11,,
46,0.97,247.347,256.923,"To these discussions, and technical feedback, it has become clear what Renters really need in these situations is the right of first refusal.",11,,
47,0.97,256.923,273.973,"Where a landlord is required to give the current tenant the first chance to sign a new lease before offering that lease to any other potential tenants, unless there is a just cause.",11,,
48,0.97,273.973,275.575,Our new United build takes that approach.,11,,
49,0.97,275.575,279.445,What Renters really need is a new lease long before there is any question of Eviction.,11,,
50,0.97,279.445,289.589,Fuel Renters in reality are told by their landlord will not have their lease refused will refuse to leave just because Seattle losses they cannot be evicted in that situation.,11,,
51,0.97,289.589,311.177,"In real life, ordinary people, working people, Renters and especially families with children who have many other urgent responsibilities, will start looking for a new place to live, even though they may know or be aware that it is unjust and they cannot be evicted because they understandably don't feel confident to have to potentially fight it out in court.",11,,
52,0.97,311.177,323.122,"Our new bill puts the right of first refusal into the part of Seattle's law for the municipal court, the Seattle Department of construction and inspection has the power to enforce.",11,,
53,0.97,323.122,344.444,"If the landlord does not offer a new lease, and does not also have a just cause, 60 to 90 days before the end of the lease, the Department of construction and inspection has the power to follow-up, investigate, tell the landlord that they either need to offer a new lease or present a just cause not to.",11,,
54,0.97,344.444,349.348,The department can issue a citation on a notice of violation and start issuing fines if a landlord refuses to follow the law.,11,,
55,0.97,349.348,360.059,"All this can happen before the lease ends, so Ideally these issues can be resolved of the Renter can get a new lease without anyone going to Eviction court.",11,,
56,0.97,360.059,371.471,"A few other details, the bill also includes a private right of action so that Renters have the option of doing that and not relying solely on the Department of construction and inspection to help enforce their rights.",11,,
57,0.97,371.471,388.955,It includes a provision in Seattle's just cause Eviction ordinance that States--and this is a problem currently in the law--that States that landlord may not take the tenant to Eviction court if the landlord has failed to follow this right of first refusal law.,11,,
58,0.97,388.955,394.394,"In other words, if the landlord does not follow this new law, they cannot then also benefit from that law by Evicting someone.",11,,
59,0.97,394.394,399.899,This is consistent with other parts of Seattle's just cause law that enforces the duties of landlords.,11,,
60,0.97,399.899,409.008,"For example, a landlord may not Evict a Renter from a unit that is not registered as a rental housing unit in Seattle.",11,,
61,0.97,409.008,423.89,"The bill will also create structures for rent and how a mutual termination agreement can be rescinded, and the bill AMENDS Seattle's first In-Kind law to clarify that the first In-Kind provisions only relate to certain current new tenants.",11,,
62,0.97,423.89,430.129,The effect only after someone--the current tenant does not agree to renew their current lease.,11,,
63,0.97,430.129,439.939,The committee has been discussing these bills with the hope to vote at tomorrow's committee meeting to allow us to stay on schedule.,11,,
64,0.97,439.939,445.211,Councilmember Morales and I hope to walk onto today's introduction and referral calendar this new document.,11,,
65,0.97,445.211,450.65,We need to walk on a new draft other than simply bring a amendment because there is a title change.,11,,
66,0.97,450.65,454.754,I really appreciate the work from the city attorney's office.,11,,
67,0.97,454.754,469.769,"The city council central staff, and my office and Councilmember Morales' office for working to get this legislation ready for introduction over the weekend.",11,,
68,0.97,469.769,474.507,Because this draft was not ready in time to sent to the city council offices by the Friday at 5:00 P.M.,11,,
69,0.97,474.507,483.583,"Deadline, we will need to request to suspend the rules before making the motion to amend the introduction and referral calendar for our Council rules.",11,,
70,0.97,483.583,494.36,"I intend to make that motion at the city council meeting today t 2:00 p.m., and I hope all Councilmembers will support introducing this new draft so that we have it available for the committee discussion tomorrow.",11,,
71,0.97,494.36,498.397,This new draft of the legislation will be sent to all Council offices this morning.,11,,
72,0.97,498.397,504.904,This morning I'm also circulating a city council letter to President Biden and the U.S. Congress for signatures.,11,,
73,0.97,504.904,517.517,The letter calls on President Biden and the U.S. Congress to put an end to weapons sales center diplomatic cover for the Israeli government in their attacks on the Palestinian people in Gaza.,11,,
74,0.97,517.517,527.426,"Evictions of Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem, and the organized violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli government and by settlers.",11,,
75,0.97,527.426,543.943,"After issuing our initial draft for my office last week, and following our discussion last Monday, at the city council briefing, as many of you already know, my office went ahead and set the original version of the letter to President Biden and Congress members last week.",11,,
76,0.97,543.943,551.551,"As I mentioned, that letter had received support from many community organizations.",11,,
77,0.97,551.551,560.559,"Additionally as I said it briefing last week, I was looking forward to working with all Councilmembers to get a version of the letter ready that incorporated Edits from you all as long as the essential message of the letter was not watered down.",11,,
78,0.97,560.559,568.2,"My office received substantial feedback from several Councilmembers, which I greatly appreciate.",11,,
79,0.97,568.2,582.782,"Over the last few days we've shared the evolving draft with Councilmembers and though I don't necessarily prefer all of the Edits, my office has incorporated all of the input from Councilmembers into the final version as the essential message is still carrying through.",11,,
80,0.97,582.782,585.952,I'm really happy to see that.,11,,
81,0.97,585.952,588.654,My staff sent you the final version just before 9:00 A.M.,11,,
82,0.97,588.654,593.459,Today because the Edits were still evolving.,11,,

84,0.97,595.094,607.306,"Over the passed week, I have heard from hundreds of Seattle community members demanding that we as the legislative body of the city, take the stand in solidarity with Palestinian people, and denounce the U.S.",11,,
85,0.97,607.306,611.177,Funded state violence perpetrated by the government Úof is real.,11,,
86,0.97,611.177,614.981,"This letter, this last version of the letter does that and I really look forward to your support.",11,,
87,0.97,614.981,625.391,We also know that nearly 700 community members have written to the Council urging that we send this letter to President Biden.,11,,
88,0.97,625.391,642.241,"The letter properly notes the tragic loss of both Israeli and Palestinian life in the fighting in the last week . One Congresswoman said no child, Palestinian or Israeli, whoever they are should ever have to worry that death will rain from the sky.",11,,
89,0.97,642.241,647.747,We also know this is not about both sides bearing equal responsibility.,11,,
90,0.97,647.747,661.727,"As the organization Jewish voice for peace has pointed out, the violence between Israelis and panelists that man's is often falsely presented as a conflict between two equal sides with irreconcilable claims to one piece of land.",11,,

95,0.97,689.989,711.077,"Second, the governments armed assault at a mosque, and third with organized violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli government . all of this is noted in the letter, alongside as I said, with all your Edits incorporated.",11,,
96,0.97,711.077,724.49,We have to be clear also that the U.S. government has played an important role in supporting these policies with nearly $4 billion in annual aid to the Israeli military and the political cover of the government's decades long brutality against the Palestinian people.,11,,
97,0.97,724.49,726.725,It has been part of a long-term policy of successful U.S.,11,,

257,0.97,1835.8,1847.545,"As a reminder, the 2021 adopted budget included just over $28 million, $28.3 million for Participatory budgeting and different Council budget actions.",18,,
258,0.97,1847.545,1849.814,That money is sitting in finance general under proviso.,18,,
259,0.97,1849.814,1861.559,"This bill would lift one proviso, and would appropriate $1.05 million to the office of civil rights for Participatory budgeting.",18,,

265,0.97,1898.563,1913.578,"The three staff members would provide administrative, technical, and logistical support and the third-party administrator would be responsible for hiring and managing the steering committee for Participatory budgeting, as well as other staff that is kind of managing the volunteer process.",18,,
266,0.97,1913.578,1916.614,Providing technical support and expertise.,18,,

268,0.97,1927.625,1930.428,The third-party vendor would manage those processes as well.,18,,
269,0.97,1930.428,1944.309,"The legislation also includes $15,000 to support community members in their participation in helping craft the Rfp, and to participate in the selection process itself.",18,,
270,0.97,1944.309,1950.949,"So, we heard the bill in committee last week.",18,,
271,0.97,1950.949,1958.256,"I am requesting that rather than delay to hear the final bill, we do have the bill number now.",18,,
272,0.97,1958.256,1970.468,"Rather than delay that to here in committee again, that we add it to the introduction and referral calendar, and that my colleagues be prepared to vote on it in full Council on June 1ST.",18,,
273,0.97,1970.468,1975.54,This will allow us to step the process up by a couple of weeks and finally start to get this money out the door.,18,,
274,0.97,1975.54,1981.846,"So, that is what we are--what is on the calendar.",18,,
275,0.97,1981.846,1999.53,"I would encourage my colleagues, if you have questions, if you have amendments that you might be considering, to reach out to me or to my staff member Lakisha farmer, who I just want to say has been doing a fantastic job of collaborating, coordinating, central staff and OCR and community members.",18,,

280,0.97,2010.008,2023.287,"My office has, as you know, also been working on tenant bill of rights as Councilmember Sawant mentioned.",18,,
281,0.97,2023.287,2026.924,We been working with a coalition of community Stakeholders to build a tenant's bill of rights this year.,18,,
282,0.97,2026.924,2042.74,The first piece of legislation is intended to close the no cause termination gap in existing legislation and to provide all tenants with protections under the just cause Eviction ordinance.,18,,
283,0.97,2042.74,2052.95,"We have been working together, as Councilmember Sawant outlines, our two offices have come together and agreed to take sort of the best elements of both, and move forward on a jointly sponsored new bill.",18,,
284,0.97,2052.95,2067.765,"That could close the gap and offer a right of first refusal to seek new tenancy in their current home, and end the specified Tennessee language.",18,,
285,0.97,2067.765,2070.768,This would allow tenants the opportunity to stay in their homes.,18,,
286,0.97,2070.768,2080.978,It was still require that landlords have a just cause reason to have a tenant involuntarily removed but would be able to provide Perfections to folks.,18,,
287,0.97,2080.978,2090.088,I want to thank my staff are doing the coordination on that side of the work that we are advocating and advancing.,18,,
288,0.97,2090.088,2099.263,And also thank Councilmember Sawant's office for agreeing to work together on this really crucial protection.,18,,
289,0.97,2099.263,2104.502,I also want to thank Councilmember Lewis for continuing to support this effort to close the gap.,18,,
290,0.97,2104.502,2107.505,I want to invite him to cosponsor the new bill as well.,18,,
291,0.97,2107.505,2113.978,Are two offices plan to walk this on this afternoon so it can be referred to the Sustainability Committee for discussion.,18,,
292,0.97,2113.978,2121.986,The second piece of legislation in this tenants bill of rights is the sound at home Eviction defense.,18,,
293,0.97,2121.986,2128.092,We will be hearing that in the Sustainability and Renters rights committee tomorrow.,18,,
294,0.97,2128.092,2135.199,Colleagues will recall this defense will protect Renters from facing Eviction if they suffered a financial hardship brought on by the pandemic.,18,,
295,0.97,2135.199,2145.343,What we know is that Renters most affected by pandemic related rent are people of color.,18,,
296,0.97,2145.343,2149.413,Really kept our community running for the last year.,18,,
297,0.97,2149.413,2159.157,"So, it's really crucial that we pass both of these protections before the end of the Eviction moratorium in June.",18,,
298,0.97,2159.157,2177.275,"So, I do want to call on our Mayor to extend the moratorium at least through the summer, if not the end of the year so we can be sure folks have protections, and that they aren't caught in this trap of mounting debt and an inability to take care of that before the legislation passes.",18,,
299,0.97,2177.275,2185.816,"I want to thank community members in my colleagues who have supported the tenants rights work that we have undertaken this year, and I look forward to their support on this legislation.",18,,

302,0.97,2190.655,2208.506,I think everybody knows by now that our public health officer issued a directive this week asking--last week Axing for people to continue wearing masks if they are in indoor spaces.,18,,
303,0.97,2208.506,2214.412,"We know there is no way to know if somebody who is not wearing a mask is Vaccinated, or just chooses not to wear a mask.",18,,
304,0.97,2214.412,2225.389,"Because we still have elevated hospitalization rates, and case counts, and because less than half of the people in King County are eligible, are fully Vaccinated.",18,,
305,0.97,2225.389,2229.827,Including my children who are under 12 years old.,18,,

353,0.97,2538.002,2548.545,"One I was we missed in not mentioning, which I had mentioned at last week's briefing, but I wanted to just say it again today.",22,,
354,0.97,2548.545,2550.447,I think they are coming up on it.,22,,
355,0.97,2550.447,2566.63,"Three months ago, my office had brought a resolution forward to the city council urging the Mayor that the citywide moratorium, Eviction moratorium, be extended to the end of this year.",22,,
356,0.97,2566.63,2574.138,We built a lot of community pressure at that time with hundreds of people signing a community petition.,22,,
357,0.97,2574.138,2581.378,"Just before the resolution was going to come up for a vote, the Mayor extended the Eviction moratorium at that time to June 30th.",22,,
358,0.97,2581.378,2587.751,"If Councilmembers remember, we held a vote on that bill to a future date.",22,,
359,0.97,2587.751,2591.388,"That future date is coming up, which is June 7th.",22,,
360,0.97,2591.388,2605.402,"June 7th is a Monday, and at that city council agenda, that city council meeting agenda, this resolution is slated to come up for a vote.",22,,
361,0.97,2605.402,2608.772,The resolution basically says the Eviction moratorium should be extended to the end of this year.,22,,
362,0.97,2608.772,2611.108,"I mentioned this last week, but I wanted to say it again.",22,,
363,0.97,2611.108,2612.509,I think it is really important.,22,,
364,0.97,2612.509,2635.499,"Express my thank you to the Washington community action network, who just sent out a community Email last week about how that they also are observing from their conversations with Renters, and the crisis that Renters are under, that the crisis is far from going to be gone.",22,,
365,0.97,2635.499,2639.937,Even though the economy is picking up a little bit.,22,,
366,0.97,2639.937,2654.151,"The Eviction moratorium being extended to the end of this year is a bare minimum necessity given the debt Unfortunately that so many working people, Renters have accumulated from the passed months of the pandemic.",22,,
367,0.97,2654.151,2662.559,"So, I really wanted to thank the Washington community action network again and also just remind Councilmembers that that is coming up for a vote.",22,,
368,0.97,2662.559,2662.926,Thank you.,22,,
369,0.97,2662.926,2666.163,"On June 7th, not next week.",22,,
370,0.97,2666.163,2667.765,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",23,,
371,0.97,2667.765,2677.875,"If there are no further comments or questions, related to Councilmember Morales' report, I do just have a couple words.",23,,
372,0.97,2677.875,2685.682,"As mentioned, by Councilmember Morales on the Councilmember agenda this afternoon, vote on counts of the 120071.",23,,
373,0.97,2685.682,2695.292,"This bill strengthens the existing commercial rent control and existing protections, rent protections for small businesses and nonprofit Renters.",23,,
374,0.97,2695.292,2714.711,You may recall that ordinance 126066 was passed by the Council in April of 2020 in response to concerns for the financial health and stability of our city's beloved small business and Nonprofits during Covid.,23,,
375,0.97,2714.711,2720.818,The bill itself provided them with additional protections during the existence of this pandemic civil emergency declared on March 3RD.,23,,
376,0.97,2720.818,2728.125,Its main provisions are putting in place commercial rent control.,23,,
377,0.97,2728.125,2732.596,"By way of a moratorium on rent increases for small businesses and Nonprofits, as long as the civil emergency persists.",23,,
378,0.97,2732.596,2746.61,"It also requires late rent paid in installments, according to a payment plan during the term of the civil emergency and for six months following the civil emergency.",23,,
379,0.97,2746.61,2750.013,And it SETS parameters for an acceptable payment plan.,23,,
380,0.97,2750.013,2766.73,"For instance, the payment plan can't require small businesses or Nonprofits to pay more than one third of late rent within any given month.",23,,
381,0.97,2766.73,2769.466,All late rent must be repaid within a year of the civil emergency.,23,,
382,0.97,2769.466,2777.474,"No late fees, interest, or other charges can be added.",23,,
383,0.97,2777.474,2787.317,These all are protections that are currently in place for small businesses and Nonprofits and will continue to be in place until the end of the civil emergency.,23,,
384,0.97,2787.317,2794.958,"In the case of rent control, and for six months beyond the civil emergency, in the case of payment plans.",23,,
385,0.97,2794.958,2813.01,"The legislation before us AMENDS this legislation to ensure that first rent installments paid according to a payment plan negotiated under the original ordinance, 126066, cannot be considered late.",23,,
386,0.97,2813.01,2830.894,"This particular clarification comes at the request of a commercial tenant, whose landlord is attempting to exercise a Nonrenewable clause in their lease regarding late rent, even though that rent is being paid according to a payment plan as authorized.",23,,
387,0.97,2830.894,2837.601,"Us making this change is not going to help this particular tenant, but it shows a gap in the system legislation.",23,,
388,0.97,2837.601,2848.545,That is a gap that exists for other tenants that are taking advantage of the payment plan option provided by the bill passed by Council last year.,23,,
389,0.97,2848.545,2865.629,"So, I'm really hoping that taking action this time will encourage small businesses, Nonprofits, and their lessors to enter into conversations about what it will take for tenants to recover and address their arrears to the good of all parties, and the communities they serve.",23,,
390,0.97,2865.629,2872.536,"In developing this legislation, my office reached out to the small business owners, who helped us with the first bill.",23,,
391,0.97,2872.536,2877.174,To check in with their thoughts.,23,,
392,0.97,2877.174,2888.785,"One emphasized the importance of giving landlords and tenants a reason to sit down together and talk about their respective plans, positions, and perspectives.",23,,
393,0.97,2888.785,2903.6,"He is both a commercial tenant and the landlord, and from his perspective, his experience was that the conversations are difficult, but he has found that he was able to break through in all cases.",23,,
394,0.97,2903.6,2904.902,Negotiate plans that work for everyone.,23,,
395,0.97,2904.902,2909.706,"Again, this legislation gives as a foundation to have those conversations.",23,,
396,0.97,2909.706,2920.284,We also requested that the Washington hospitality Association review the proposed legislation and give them the opportunity to suggest additional changes.,23,,
397,0.97,2920.284,2922.719,They shared it with the members who gave it the green light.,23,,
398,0.97,2922.719,2935.098,"Want to thank Councilmember Morales for allowing this at last week's community economic--community and economic development Committee, so that if approved it can potentially be in effect before the end of the commercial Eviction moratorium on June 30th.",23,,
399,0.97,2935.098,2946.009,Thanks to Councilmember Lewis for adding his sponsorship to this legislation in the community and economic development committee meeting.,23,,
400,0.97,2946.009,2949.746,Thank you.,23,,
401,0.97,2949.746,2960.857,"If there are no questions about that item, Filibustering here.",23,,
402,0.97,2960.857,2963.193,"Councilmember Alice, yes.",23,,
403,0.97,2963.193,2968.765,I would also be interested in Cosponsoring this legislation.,24,,
404,0.97,2968.765,2970.867,Thank you.,24,,
405,0.97,2970.867,2975.272,"Thank you so much Councilmember Morales, really appreciate it.",25,,

411,0.97,2993.19,3003.7,"However, as Council President pro Tem noted I will be bringing forward a proclamation honoring the life and legacy and work of public health director Patty Hayes.",26,,
412,0.97,3003.7,3022.619,"As folks know from last week's announcement she will be retiring on May 28 from the Seattle King County public health Department after serving the Department of over 1500 employees, serving 2 million residents in King County, over the passed seven years.",26,,
413,0.97,3022.619,3036.233,"She's also been part of a team leading us through the historic crisis we've faced both in combating the impacts of Covid, and she's been instrumental in bringing forward additional priorities related to the other public health crises of gun violence and racism.",26,,
414,0.97,3036.233,3042.339,I've had the opportunity to work with director Hayes going back to about 2005.,26,,
415,0.97,3042.339,3046.41,She was at the State Department of health.,26,,
416,0.97,3046.41,3057.154,"I'm really excited about honoring her work and legacy, and wishing her well in her next endeavor and in retirement.",26,,

476,0.97,3495.091,3510.306,Also speak out unequivocally about anti-Semitism and speaking up for an end to the ongoing Israel and Palestine conflict I understand this letter is just one way to express concern and call for support for House resolution 2590 and to continue to call for an end to military aid in the blockade.,26,,

565,0.97,4082.144,4087.65,That is on today's agenda coming from committee.,33,,
566,0.97,4087.65,4100.796,"So just stepping back a little bit, the item that is on the full council committee agenda that came out of committee is called Council bill 120065.",33,,
567,0.97,4100.796,4116.679,This bill is intended to transfer both 911 dispatch and the parking enforcement units from SPD to the community safety and communications center.,33,,

569,0.97,4131.093,4152.448,"I will be bringing an amendment to this bill that was posted on the agenda, and the amendment is intended to remove the transfer of the PEO's from SPD to the new community safety and communications center from the legislation so they will not be transferred with the passage of this particular bill.",33,,
570,0.97,4152.448,4167.062,"Once the PEO's are removed from the bill, I intend on moving the bill as amended to transfer the 911 dispatch to the new community safety and communications center.",33,,
571,0.97,4167.062,4182.278,"With the amendment, it will allow more time for consideration around the PEO transfer, but it will authorize the transfer of the 911 dispatch to the new Department.",33,,
572,0.97,4182.278,4190.185,"Also on the agenda is item 13, that's Council bill 120078.",33,,
573,0.97,4190.185,4199.962,The intention of that bill is to extend the proviso that was enacted by the Council during the fall budget deliberations.,33,,
574,0.97,4199.962,4209.672,And allow the PEO unit to continue to get paid until September.,33,,
575,0.97,4209.672,4214.176,"The reason why this is necessary is that the Council, with the budget process, enacted a proviso.",33,,
576,0.97,4214.176,4221.684,"That proviso was intended to ensure the Council's direction to move 911 dispatch, and PEO's into the new division.",33,,
577,0.97,4221.684,4225.521,Into the new community safety and communications center.,33,,
578,0.97,4225.521,4240.603,The proviso that basically says that both units would only get paid through September if they weren't transferred.,33,,
579,0.97,4240.603,4246.842,"We need to amend that legislation if we are not going to transfer the PEO's at that time, at this time.",33,,
580,0.97,4246.842,4250.145,And allow us a little bit more time to continue these conversations.,33,,
581,0.97,4250.145,4267.963,"So, I will be amending the agenda to switch up the order and move consideration of Council bill 120078 to directly follow consideration of Council bill 120065, because both issues go together.",33,,
582,0.97,4267.963,4278.974,"Just some background for folks who aren't watching what's happening in my committee meeting, the reason we are doing this is because Council bill 120065 was voted out with a divided report.",33,,
583,0.97,4278.974,4295.858,"In my estimation, today's actions with these amendments are intended to give Council additional time before finalizing the transfer of the PEO's as previously planned and requested by the PEO rank and file.",33,,
584,0.97,4295.858,4312.007,"Just a quick background during the budget, we passed ordinance 126633, that established the new community safety and communications center and included both 911 dispatch and PEO's and that new center.",33,,
585,0.97,4312.007,4327.89,"The creation of the community safety and communications center is intended to help Reframe how the city provides for community safety, and response to the Council's interest in exploring expanded duty for the PEO's.",33,,
586,0.97,4327.89,4340.135,"The center, the community safety and communications center was intended to began performing the 911 call center and parking enforcement functions by June 1ST.",33,,
587,0.97,4340.135,4354.149,Essentially before we included a proviso in that Council action during budget in order to make sure that that actually happened by June 1ST it is outlined in the central staff memo.,33,,
588,0.97,4354.149,4360.823,The Council at the time took a different approach than the one that the Mayor was proposing in the budget to have the PEO's transferred to Sdot.,33,,
589,0.97,4360.823,4380.542,"This different approach was initiated by--when I say the different approach, the approach that the Council took was initiated by the PEO rank and file themselves, who reached out to the Council with their vision of being a part of the new civilian public safety response team.",33,,
590,0.97,4380.542,4395.991,"So, to fulfill that vision, the ordinance 126233 also required that the executive report on the possible expansion of PEO responsibilities to include managing traffic at lighted intersections.",33,,
591,0.97,4395.991,4399.795,Reporting on minor thefts.,33,,
592,0.97,4399.795,4411.006,"Response to Noninjury collisions, and a number of different functions . Some of them related to Right-Of-Way management, and some of them not.",33,,
593,0.97,4411.006,4419.915,"In addition, the council passed two slides, one on the cost of using the PEO's for traffic control during special events.",33,,
594,0.97,4419.915,4425.421,One on merging or Co-Locating the police Department and the fire Department call centers.,33,,
595,0.97,4425.421,4427.189,These reports have been delayed.,33,,
596,0.97,4427.189,4441.236,"Then, also just for context, of who this legislation would impact, there are roughly 106 rank and file PEO's, and 12 supervisors.",33,,
597,0.97,4441.236,4446.308,"Before I move on, just want to take a pause.",33,,
598,0.97,4446.308,4453.048,Central staff are on the call this morning to answer any questions about this process.,33,,
599,0.97,4453.048,4458.12,Both the process and the content of the bills before us.,33,,
600,0.97,4458.12,4466.662,"If anybody has questions or comments, again, I'm going to take a pause before I move on to the rest of my report.",33,,
601,0.97,4466.662,4469.465,"I see Councilmember Lewis, your hand is up.",33,,
602,0.97,4469.465,4472.367,"Yes, Madam President pro Tem.",34,,
603,0.97,4472.367,4483.679,I just wanted to voice support for the way that you're proposing and going forward with this issue.,34,,
604,0.97,4483.679,4494.089,"For me, and maybe I'm getting ahead of it because I think you're inviting central staff questions, but I'll just get it all out there now.",34,,
605,0.97,4494.089,4497.96,I appreciate the reports that you're putting forward.,34,,
606,0.97,4497.96,4503.999,As a policymaker I feel pretty confident navigating the bureaucratic issues around this.,34,,
607,0.97,4503.999,4511.974,I support the vision of having the parking enforcement officers be a big part of the new public safety system that we are creating.,34,,
608,0.97,4511.974,4528.223,That has a role for--a bigger role for them in a variety of different things that have historically been done by uniformed armed police.,34,,
609,0.97,4528.223,4532.895,The thing that me that makes me want to take a little bit more time is that we do have some labor division.,34,,
610,0.97,4532.895,4546.441,"I think it's an important thing to not only recognize the expertise of the rank-and-file officers, but also the unionized supervisors who do have some disagreements.",34,,
611,0.97,4546.441,4557.252,Seeking some labor unity on an issue like this I do think warrants are attention to take a few more months to really intentionally listen to both of these unions to try to reconcile their concerns and reconcile it with the vision we all want to see.,34,,
612,0.97,4557.252,4577.573,"I just want to signal to the public, it's not so much concessions for some of the more bureaucratic reasons, or competition of different bureaucratic units, but it really is for me an interest in seeking a harmony between the different labor groups here.",34,,
613,0.97,4577.573,4594.99,"Just making sure that we center their leadership and sent to their concerns and take it seriously when we do have a workforce that represents the supervisors coming forward and saying no, no, like we have a couple things we want to have worked out.",34,,
614,0.97,4594.99,4598.293,"I think that once us taking some time to respect that process, respect their leadership.",34,,
615,0.97,4598.293,4610.372,"It doesn't mean we ultimately won't put the parking enforcement officers into this new unit, but it just means we will do it in a way that is intentional and does not create division within those workforce.",34,,
616,0.97,4610.372,4611.44,Between the supervisors and rank-and-file.,34,,
617,0.97,4611.44,4618.547,I really appreciate Madam President pro Tem your leadership in setting out this course to give space to those discussions.,34,,
618,0.97,4618.547,4628.924,I think it will lead to a better longer-term policy and peace between those two bargaining units.,34,,
619,0.97,4628.924,4632.828,"So, thank you so much and I look forward to supporting the actions as you have laid them out.",34,,
620,0.97,4632.828,4633.962,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",35,,
621,0.97,4633.962,4651.847,"I don't see any other raised hands, but I am going to ask Ms. K whether or not there any gaps in my description or any other points that you might make to make this afternoon's discussion on the parliamentary pieces go a little bit more smoothly.",35,,
622,0.97,4651.847,4660.856,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, I don't really have anything to add.",36,,
623,0.97,4660.856,4666.762,"I think at one point you Mntioned, I just wanted to clarify the original budget proviso would have transferred the employees June 1ST.",36,,
624,0.97,4666.762,4675.47,"The extension would extended to September 1. I think there was a small Glitch in that spirit other than that, other than that you said anything I would have said.",36,,
625,0.97,4675.47,4677.672,Thank you so much.,37,,

764,0.97,5575.069,5577.972,Thank you President pro Tem Herbold.,67,,
765,0.97,5577.972,5586.08,I just quickly wanted to share some things that just came in in relation to this.,67,,
766,0.97,5586.08,5591.152,"Also, I know Councilmember Strauss was starting to say something about this morning.",67,,
767,0.97,5591.152,5600.895,"I just wanted to say that we, my office obviously circulated the first version of the letter last Monday.",67,,
768,0.97,5600.895,5603.164,"Then, sent out the draft on Tuesday morning.",67,,
769,0.97,5603.164,5606.0,Sent an updated version last Friday.,67,,
770,0.97,5606.0,5611.272,"Another one with further updates on Sunday evening, and the final version this morning.",67,,
771,0.97,5611.272,5618.346,Some of this timing was just because of the timing of the edit in which we were receiving.,67,,
772,0.97,5618.346,5624.085,It's not something we could have done anything about.,67,,
773,0.97,5624.085,5629.924,"So, a lot of the Edits came in during those Iterations.",67,,
774,0.97,5629.924,5637.231,I've incorporated every single one of the Edits that came from Councilmembers.,67,,
775,0.97,5637.231,5640.701,We haven't received any Edits from Councilmember Strauss at any point in this drafting and sharing.,67,,
776,0.97,5640.701,5654.548,"Also, I wanted to share that, while we were having our briefing this morning, an important letter arrived to the whole Council.",67,,
777,0.97,5654.548,5658.819,All Councilmembers have this in their Email box.,67,,
778,0.97,5658.819,5665.059,I really wanted to recognize this publicly because it's such an important letter from a rabbi.,67,,
779,0.97,5665.059,5666.861,I just read an extract from the letter.,67,,
780,0.97,5666.861,5675.269,"In the letter, the rabbi says the Jewish people are who I have directly dedicated my life and family.",67,,
781,0.97,5675.269,5678.272,Today I am asking for your help.,67,,
782,0.97,5678.272,5689.884,The Jewish leadership of the state of Israel needs outside intervention to end its Heartbreakingly brutal and ongoing occupation of the West bank in East Jerusalem.,67,,
783,0.97,5689.884,5695.156,Its seizure of the Gaza strip and its military backed continued supplement project.,67,,
784,0.97,5695.156,5698.993,Please help us say not in our name.,67,,
785,0.97,5698.993,5705.699,This letter could be a historic step in the direction of holding my people Lovingly accountable.,67,,
786,0.97,5705.699,5732.726,"A step we sadly need for our own sake as much as for the sake of the millions of Palestinians whose lives--sorry, millions of Palestinian lives you have been ended, limited, and traumatized on behalf of cynical right-wing Western ideologies . please sign the letter brought forward by representative Sawant.",67,,
787,0.97,5732.726,5734.595,As an act that represent your local constituents.,67,,
788,0.97,5734.595,5751.912,Really wanted to thank the rabbi for this absolutely moving letter and I think this is--I think part of the historical record of people in our city who are taking a correct position on a very important issue.,67,,
789,0.97,5751.912,5765.659,"Just to also update what I said in the briefing, I think the city Council has now received 773 Emails in favor of our Palestine letter.",67,,
790,0.97,5765.659,5767.027,Their 197 letters against.,67,,
791,0.97,5767.027,5769.463,Thank you.,67,,
792,0.97,5769.463,5771.866,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",68,,
793,0.97,5771.866,5773.467,Councilmember Strauss?,68,,
794,0.97,5773.467,5775.169,Thank you.,69,,
795,0.97,5775.169,5785.746,You have not received Edits from me because I was waiting--I thought we had until today at 2:00 P.M.,69,,
796,0.97,5785.746,5790.184,To review any changes that you had made and then submit my Edits to you Councilmember.,69,,
797,0.97,5790.184,5794.488,In part because the letter we received last week was not workable in my opinion.,69,,
798,0.97,5794.488,5798.159,Glad to see that the letter has made movement forward.,69,,
799,0.97,5798.159,5803.998,I still have Edits before I will be comfortable signing my name.,69,,
800,0.97,5803.998,5821.715,"Councilmembers, colleagues, I urged us to each individually send a letter if the choice is between signing the letter today right now, and signing it or not, I would urge us all to each send our own individual letters.",69,,
801,0.97,5821.715,5825.319,"Thank you, Council President pro Tem.",69,,
802,0.97,5825.319,5826.487,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",70,,
803,0.97,5826.487,5835.963,Just want to note that the discussion of this letter as other business on last week's full council agenda was unusual.,70,,
804,0.97,5835.963,5844.238,The normal practice of Council President Gonzalez is to do letter and proclamation signing in the morning.,70,,
805,0.97,5844.238,5852.346,"That's why, I'm sorry if you were under the impression that we were going to be hearing this at full council at 2:00.",70,,
806,0.97,5852.346,5862.356,I'm Reverting to the customary process of Council President Gonzalez to collect signatures for both proclamations and letters in the morning.,70,,
807,0.97,5862.356,5869.863,"Again, my apologies if that information did not make it to you.",70,,
808,0.97,5869.863,5883.277,I do want to just say a couple Úwords about my appreciation that Councilmember Sawant has accepted Edits that have been offered.,70,,
809,0.97,5883.277,5889.55,So that the letter can reflect the perspective of a broader segment of the Council.,70,,
810,0.97,5889.55,5895.856,"In particular, I really appreciate Councilmember Mosqueda's Edits that were accepted.",70,,
811,0.97,5895.856,5901.695,That really focused the letter toward support of hr 2590.,70,,
812,0.97,5901.695,5910.471,Of which our own Congresswoman is a cosponsor.,70,,
813,0.97,5910.471,5919.213,The goal of hr 2590 is to promote and protect the human rights of Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation.,70,,
814,0.97,5919.213,5928.022,And to ensure that the United States taxpayer funds are not used by the government of is real to support the military detention of Palestinian children.,70,,
815,0.97,5928.022,5943.137,The unlawful seizure appropriation and destruction of Palestinian property and forceful transfer of civilians in the West Bank for further Annexation of Palestinian land in violation of international law.,70,,
816,0.97,5943.137,5965.326,"Again, I appreciate that this--that the letter is really focused on supporting an action that is before Congress and see that we have Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Strauss' hands both virtually raised again.",70,,
817,0.97,5965.326,5966.66,Councilmember Sawant?,70,,
818,0.97,5966.66,5974.868,Maybe it makes sense for me to go after comments have been made.,71,,
819,0.97,5974.868,5977.671,I any other comments.,72,,
820,0.97,5977.671,5981.475,I do see Councilmember Strauss' hand up again.,72,,
821,0.97,5981.475,5983.944,Councilmember Strauss?,72,,
822,0.97,5983.944,5988.082,"Thank you, Council President pro Tem.",73,,
823,0.97,5988.082,5990.484,I understand the customary nature.,73,,
824,0.97,5990.484,5992.486,Recording stopped.,74,,
825,0.97,5992.486,5995.989,I noticed that the recording just stopped.,75,,
826,0.97,5995.989,5999.393,Is that intentional?,75,,
827,0.97,5999.393,6005.699,We have a technical difficulty that just occurred.,76,,
828,0.97,6005.699,6007.568,Let me just begin recording again.,76,,
829,0.97,6007.568,6009.403,Thank you.,77,,
830,0.97,6009.403,6011.605,Recording in progress.,78,,
831,0.97,6011.605,6014.007,Are we still there?,79,,
832,0.97,6014.007,6017.711,We are recording.,80,,
833,0.97,6017.711,6019.113,"Great, thank you.",81,,
834,0.97,6019.113,6025.619,"For the record, there was nothing . I stopped my comments.",81,,
835,0.97,6025.619,6037.03,"Council President pro Tem, I recognize your desire to keep us on track with the customary nature of having resolutions and letters in the morning.",81,,
836,0.97,6037.03,6052.046,"The issue that I'm having here is similar to the issue that you explained last week with the lack of time to respond, to review, and to share important Edits.",81,,
837,0.97,6052.046,6063.557,"I guess I had also not understood that we were going to continue to move forward with this letter this week, since the cease-fire hadn't occurred between the letter conversation last week and today.",81,,
838,0.97,6063.557,6066.827,I sit in a unique position here.,81,,
839,0.97,6066.827,6072.566,As a Jewish-American who is on this Council.,81,,
840,0.97,6072.566,6079.073,"I have a very Nuanced understanding, and I condemned the Israeli attacks on Gaza.",81,,
841,0.97,6079.073,6087.981,"It is not within my frame, my world frame view of how we should be conducting business in this world.",81,,
842,0.97,6087.981,6092.686,It's a humanitarian crisis and should be addressed as such.,81,,
843,0.97,6092.686,6098.392,"That said, I also am not at a comfortable point signing onto this letter without being able to provide additional feedback.",81,,
844,0.97,6098.392,6099.993,That's the issue that I sit personally.,81,,
845,0.97,6099.993,6101.595,In this moment.,81,,
846,0.97,6101.595,6103.397,On this Council.,81,,
847,0.97,6103.397,6117.211,"I know I have urged many times for us on Council not to engage ourselves in international politics, yet here we are.",81,,
848,0.97,6117.211,6126.019,That's my personal request as Councilmember Gonzalez mentioned this morning does many ways for many of us to engage in different ways.,81,,
849,0.97,6126.019,6137.531,"That's why today I kindly asked colleagues for if you have a--if you have something to say, please do say it.",81,,
850,0.97,6137.531,6145.439,"My request is for each of us, if we have something to say on this, to write our own letters, or to take the time that is needed to get this letter right.",81,,
851,0.97,6145.439,6147.741,Thank you.,81,,
852,0.97,6147.741,6150.043,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",82,,
853,0.97,6150.043,6151.745,Councilmember Pedersen.,82,,
854,0.97,6151.745,6156.65,Thank you Council President pro Tem.,83,,
855,0.97,6156.65,6160.721,I want to support the comments made by Councilmember Strauss.,83,,
856,0.97,6160.721,6171.665,"The violence in the Middle East is horrible, and I believe all of us want to see sustainable peace, justice, and economic opportunity there, and throughout our planet.",83,,
857,0.97,6171.665,6179.84,"Regarding the letter proposed and revised by Councilmember Sawant, thank you for everybody who did put in revisions.",83,,
858,0.97,6179.84,6186.079,"Many people wrote to our offices supporting the letter, and many wrote opposing the letter.",83,,
859,0.97,6186.079,6189.149,I will be declining to sign this letter for the following reasons.,83,,
860,0.97,6189.149,6206.6,"Despite the importance of these issues, I believe Seattle city Council has a responsibility under our city charter to focus on addressing the many local challenges here, rather than spending inordinate amounts of times assessing fluid and complex international relations.",83,,
861,0.97,6206.6,6225.118,"Just as I would not expect the U.S. Congress to spend its time, it's limited time, passing resolutions about complex Seattle problems, I generally do not think city Councilmember should be crafting and sending letters for all of us to debate on complex international affairs.",83,,
862,0.97,6225.118,6238.332,"With over 300 large cities in the U.S., and so many other Stakeholders to consider, I also don't think those tasks with conducting international relations are looking to see what a particular city council thanks.",83,,
863,0.97,6238.332,6241.535,"Therefore, I feel our efforts would not have a meaningful impact.",83,,
864,0.97,6241.535,6255.148,"With so many international conflicts and injustices layered with complex histories, I generally have faith in the diverse perspectives of experience of our Seattle congressional delegation.",83,,
865,0.97,6255.148,6257.551,As well as the Biden administration to represent us.,83,,
866,0.97,6257.551,6257.851,Thank you.,83,,
867,0.97,6257.851,6264.324,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",84,,
868,0.97,6264.324,6267.16,I am not seeing any other hands raised.,84,,
869,0.97,6267.16,6269.563,I do see Councilmember Sawant's.,84,,
870,0.97,6269.563,6274.868,"So sorry, Councilmember Herbold.",85,,
871,0.97,6274.868,6277.27,I didn't have my virtual hand up.,85,,
872,0.97,6277.27,6278.739,Okay.,86,,
873,0.97,6278.739,6281.975,Councilmember Mosqueda.,86,,
874,0.97,6281.975,6285.646,"Thanks so much, I already made some comments.",87,,
875,0.97,6285.646,6290.083,I just want to reiterate Councilmember Strauss' point as well.,87,,
876,0.97,6290.083,6293.387,I know there's many ways to continue to send messages to the President and Congress.,87,,
877,0.97,6293.387,6301.895,"I mentioned one of those ways, which I've also signed up for, the action alert that Jewish voice for peace has sent out.",87,,
878,0.97,6301.895,6303.697,A great opportunity to do direct calls as well.,87,,
879,0.97,6303.697,6308.802,"I hear today's discussion more about process, and not necessarily debating the issue.",87,,
880,0.97,6308.802,6315.309,I know all of us want to continue to send messages of solidarity to Palestinian people.,87,,
881,0.97,6315.309,6318.578,Call for an end to bombardment and make sure there is lasting peace in the area.,87,,
882,0.97,6318.578,6327.087,I will appreciate that folks are using various vehicles to get that message in.,87,,
883,0.97,6327.087,6337.831,"I think that one important thing for folks to remember who might be watching this Online, is that our Council has a requirement that if we are going to do sign on letters, it does have to happen in public.",87,,
884,0.97,6337.831,6342.135,We ran into that issue a few years ago so we have to process that is somewhat unique.,87,,
885,0.97,6342.135,6345.739,And Congress they don't do sign on letters by bringing something to the floor.,87,,
886,0.97,6345.739,6348.608,This is somewhat too unique to ask for sign on letters through this vehicle.,87,,
887,0.97,6348.608,6349.843,I will be signing on today.,87,,
888,0.97,6349.843,6356.316,"I do appreciate the others, thank you for including those and to Councilmember Herbold for her Edits on the letter.",87,,
889,0.97,6356.316,6372.766,I think it's really important as we continue to think about the various ways in which messages are being shared with Congress and with the President to continue to thank our congressional member Council--Congresswoman for her leadership.,87,,
890,0.97,6372.766,6376.87,Again she is a cosponsor of House resolution 2590.,87,,
891,0.97,6376.87,6388.448,Is continuing to be part of I think the courageous and growing voice around the need to end additional military aids that we can continue to see lasting specie in the area.,87,,
892,0.97,6388.448,6393.286,I know there's a lot of concern about the fragility of the cease-fire.,87,,
893,0.97,6393.286,6399.593,Really getting at those root causes of the ongoing conflict in finding sustainable peace and solutions to the true crisis that we've seen over the last few decades.,87,,
894,0.97,6399.593,6403.063,It's really important here.,87,,
895,0.97,6403.063,6407.701,I just wanted to say I appreciate the various messages that are being sent.,87,,
896,0.97,6407.701,6418.478,The International solidarity who have been suffering and to appreciate the letter being edited in the way it was.,87,,
897,0.97,6418.478,6430.09,"I will be signing on today and I know again this is not a usual process for how letters get signed onto, but wanted to thank you all for your comments and look forward to continuing to see letters sent to the President and Congress on this important issue.",87,,
898,0.97,6430.09,6434.528,Thanks again for accepting the Edits I submitted and I'll stop here.,87,,
899,0.97,6434.528,6441.001,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",88,,
900,0.97,6441.001,6443.837,"Councilmember Strauss, I see your hand up.",88,,
901,0.97,6443.837,6445.906,"Okay, it's down.",88,,
902,0.97,6445.906,6448.041,It was not a holdover.,89,,
903,0.97,6448.041,6455.015,I'm coming back to you because Councilmember Sawant has asked to speak last.,90,,
904,0.97,6455.015,6456.249,Correct.,91,,
905,0.97,6456.249,6456.65,All right.,92,,
906,0.97,6456.65,6457.651,The floor is yours.,92,,
907,0.97,6457.651,6459.719,"Great, thank you.",93,,
908,0.97,6459.719,6466.86,I know that Councilmember Pedersen supported the words I had to say.,93,,
909,0.97,6466.86,6468.361,That is not a two way direction.,93,,
910,0.97,6468.361,6469.663,Our comments are separate.,93,,
911,0.97,6469.663,6476.77,"I don't--he may agree what I had to say, I'm leaving his comments separate and aside.",93,,
912,0.97,6476.77,6478.572,They do not reflect my views.,93,,
913,0.97,6478.572,6488.782,Just indicating for the colleagues and for the viewing public I'll be sending my own letter on my own regarding this topic.,93,,
914,0.97,6488.782,6497.691,"The choices are either sign on to what is written now, or sign onto--or write our own letter, I will be taking the latter option and writing my own letter.",93,,
915,0.97,6497.691,6502.796,"Thank you, Council President pro Tem Herbold.",93,,
916,0.97,6502.796,6504.831,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss.",94,,
917,0.97,6504.831,6507.267,I appreciate how difficult this is.,94,,
918,0.97,6507.267,6518.478,"If it's possible [Laughter] given your last comment, I really want to say I support the concept of Councilmembers sending their individual letters.",94,,
919,0.97,6518.478,6528.188,I also think--it is my desire to minimize the amount of time that we spend on this issue.,94,,
920,0.97,6528.188,6549.309,"So, that is why I actually agree with the part of what Councilmember Pedersen said related to the need to sort of try to create some--some--Buffers on the amount of time that we spend.",94,,
921,0.97,6549.309,6573.967,"That's why I would not support continuing to hold over the letter, but really, I agree with both Councilmember Mosqueda, did you, Councilmember Strauss, in that I really think there are a lot of different ways for folks, including Councilmembers, to express their opinions on this really critical issue.",94,,
922,0.97,6573.967,6575.869,Councilmember Sawant?,94,,
923,0.97,6575.869,6585.278,"Thank you, Council President pro Tem Herbold.",95,,
924,0.97,6585.278,6589.115,One of the comments I was going to make earlier was just I think you covered it really well.,95,,
