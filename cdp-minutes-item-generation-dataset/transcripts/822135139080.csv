209,0.97,1367.032,1384.449,"It was not until I worked for a previous employer, the downtown Seattle Association that I saw the way how it helps us thrive and how we connect to the multibillion investments made throughout our city and other organizations.",62,,

224,0.97,1459.858,1482.214,I think it is really important as you all said that we are very deliberate in making sure that people who can't drive or close not to drive can still move around the city in a way that is safe and gets them to the places they need to be.,67,,
225,0.97,1482.214,1506.738,"So, I really appreciate your commitment to making sure and holding us to our commitments to invest in the infrastructure that allows people to walk and roll and bike to the places they need to get.",67,,

231,0.97,1526.591,1527.425,Thank you chair Pederson.,70,,
232,0.97,1527.425,1534.9,Emily we had so many walks downtown looking for quick wins and how to improve pedestrian experience.,71,,
233,0.97,1534.9,1539.671,And Jennifer it is great to have you here.,71,,
234,0.97,1539.671,1561.593,For Jennifer since you are in strategic and project management could you share with us what you think has gone well during Covid-19 to Pedestrianize the city and what to do next and Emily what do we plead to accomplish in and around the Roosevelt station before it opens.,71,,
235,0.97,1561.593,1561.893,Sure.,72,,
236,0.97,1561.893,1569.868,There is actually a topic of conversation at our retreat last week as well as over the last few meetings.,72,,
237,0.97,1569.868,1578.176,I think I am impressed with the swiftness of the city that it has taken in implementing the stay healthy streets.,72,,
238,0.97,1578.176,1580.879,The keep moving streets.,72,,
239,0.97,1580.879,1605.537,Watching the wide array of options and choices and the communities and different avenues for communities to then be involved in and reach out to the city to get more infrastructure or tools and options for them to have that pedestrian infrastructure in their neighborhoods.,72,,
240,0.97,1605.537,1643.241,"Some areas to go next, I think, that we have been grappling with how to make sure they are not in competition with each other and how--we were very favorable and fans of the stay healthy Strets and there has been a lot of conversation about how do we keep them moving and expand our network throughout the city.",72,,
241,0.97,1643.241,1648.98,"As for Roosevelt, I am fortunate because there are things that have happened in the neighborhood and underway.",73,,
242,0.97,1648.98,1663.928,For example 65Th that is in front of the light rail station I don't know if it is part of the safety program but they add bike lanes and then narrowed the streets and adding parking so traffic just slowed down.,74,,
243,0.97,1663.928,1668.9,We did have a pedestrian fatality at 20th and 65Th a couple years ago.,74,,
244,0.97,1668.9,1671.87,Another pedestrian fatality at 12th and 65Th.,74,,
245,0.97,1671.87,1677.475,"So, those improvements have made a major change for the better.",74,,
246,0.97,1677.475,1686.484,I know traffic backs up Pre- Covid-19 but just the fact that cars are moving slower and people are running for the bus and ultimately running for light rail it is very important.,74,,
247,0.97,1686.484,1697.562,I am going to give you just more benefits because I am happy with all of them but they also added turn signals on 65Th and 15th signal that is wonderful.,74,,
248,0.97,1697.562,1699.464,It is a really scary intersection.,74,,
249,0.97,1699.464,1707.806,"And with all of the TOD going in, that is also great, there is just going to be a lot more movement of pedestrians and cars as well.",74,,
250,0.97,1707.806,1710.475,"So, those intersection improvements are huge.",74,,
251,0.97,1710.475,1731.229,"They are making--they being Sdot doing this, they have a project underway on 15th Avenue to Restripe bike lanes at 24- hour parking which again NARROWS the street from sort of a free for all 4-Lane chaos into a 1-Lane in each direction street that is, again, a beautiful thing.",74,,
252,0.97,1731.229,1738.136,Rapid flashing beacon that connects the green way on 62Nd and connects people through the park.,74,,
253,0.97,1738.136,1746.411,"So, I am--I am very pleased with what I have seen happen in anticipation of light rail and the fatalities that have happened.",74,,
254,0.97,1746.411,1755.954,It will be interesting when all of the TOD is built and the light rail station is up and running.,74,,
255,0.97,1755.954,1758.957,To see how Car/Pedestrian/Bus intersections happen at 12th and Roosevelt.,74,,
256,0.97,1758.957,1760.692,I will keep my eye on it.,74,,
257,0.97,1760.692,1761.559,We will see.,74,,
258,0.97,1761.559,1763.094,We will see what happens.,74,,
259,0.97,1763.094,1771.469,So far I have been thrilled with some of the changes that have come to Roosevelt.,74,,
260,0.97,1771.469,1778.943,"Thank you, Emily and Jennifer any more questions Councilmembers?",75,,

307,0.97,2113.478,2121.986,I would say I don't know if it is Capitol investment but having a safe route coordinator is really important.,91,,
308,0.97,2121.986,2143.174,"I think as a parent and also crossing guard and transportation advocate not having someone to bring together all of the different pieces makes it very difficult Úfor families to know who to contact or to even know what to tell students and families that are wondering how to get their kids to school, for folks that do not own vehicles which is a reality for a lot of folks living in Seattle.",91,,
309,0.97,2143.174,2146.077,It is a missing piece that needs to happen.,91,,
310,0.97,2146.077,2155.853,And then also it is really essential if we are going to--if we want to see progress of people walking and Biking and seeing them do that.,91,,
311,0.97,2155.853,2169.3,We need to have someone coordinate all of those things so it does not fall on the shoulders of someone who is not really involved in this and the burden falls on other place that it shouldn't.,91,,

515,0.97,3262.859,3264.461,This is a map of the location.,174,,
516,0.97,3264.461,3269.332,A couple things going on here that I will point out.,174,,

519,0.97,3278.074,3279.409,"Just over 10,000 acres.",174,,
520,0.97,3279.409,3285.548,You can see they run up and down the Skagit River and cross over into the Basin.,174,,
521,0.97,3285.548,3294.891,"We have two other programs that are managed, one by a separate agreement on the license and the other one, pursue ant ordinance by the city council.",174,,
522,0.97,3294.891,3297.727,"One related, both related to fish.",174,,
523,0.97,3297.727,3305.702,"One is a fish habitat acquisition and that is in the blue parts, it is difficult to see because they are smaller and located along the river.",174,,
524,0.97,3305.702,3319.916,We have a number of parcels along the Skagit River and then an Esa program where we go out and acquire habitat to help endangered species.,174,,
525,0.97,3319.916,3323.019,We look at this particular piece of property.,174,,
526,0.97,3323.019,3324.454,It is a narrow photo.,174,,
527,0.97,3324.454,3329.526,You will see the out line there.,174,,
528,0.97,3329.526,3335.765,It includes the tree area that runs along the Western or the left hand part of the property.,174,,
529,0.97,3335.765,3338.234,It is salmon Creek running into the Skagit River.,174,,
530,0.97,3338.234,3345.742,We have a little bit of salmon habitat on this.,174,,
531,0.97,3345.742,3350.513,The program was designed to benefit wildlife and birds.,174,,
532,0.97,3350.513,3354.551,"But, we also look for benefits to benefit fish wherever we can.",174,,
533,0.97,3354.551,3361.858,"It is bounded by--we look for properties under the program, the settlement plan lays out the criteria.",174,,
534,0.97,3361.858,3373.136,"Looking for large parcels, upland from the river, we like to have them adjacent to other--other of our own properties or in this case on the top side of the picture it is U.S.",174,,
535,0.97,3373.136,3376.606,Forest land and on the left side of the picture it is U.S.,174,,
536,0.97,3376.606,3380.944,Department or Washington Department of fish and wildlife lands.,174,,

538,0.97,3384.714,3388.918,We connect them to existing habitat it helps.,174,,
539,0.97,3388.918,3402.232,The picture down below SLOWS looking across to the East across the property and being used on the Western one third and hayfields on the Eastern two thirds.,174,,
540,0.97,3402.232,3412.075,For the time being we will continue to allow those to operate until we decide what else to do with the property some sometime in the near future.,174,,
541,0.97,3412.075,3420.717,The picture on the right there is a picture the creek that runs through the property.,174,,
542,0.97,3420.717,3427.69,"It runs by the transmission line, it is this diagonal line of this piece of property or off of the edge of the property.",174,,
543,0.97,3427.69,3430.627,That is the transition line coming from the Skagit projects.,174,,
544,0.97,3430.627,3445.875,"So, with that, I will just others again, we are here seeking approval, council approval to accept the deed and I will answer any questions if I can.",174,,

551,0.97,3462.692,3475.872,"Understanding it is the last project as part of the 10,000 acres and $17 million figures we will be using.",177,,
552,0.97,3475.872,3494.324,As we renew the license in 2025 do you foresee us engaging in a process similar to this where we are purchasing land for wildlife benefit?,177,,
553,0.97,3494.324,3494.591,Yes.,178,,
554,0.97,3494.591,3497.393,We will do that going forward.,178,,

557,0.97,3507.904,3526.055,Wildlife management and protection are already big pieces of it that we anticipate there will be at a minimum wildlife protection management plan if we accomplish it by settlement or third quarter we will have some new projects going forward under the new license undoubtedly.,178,,
558,0.97,3526.055,3526.756,"Wonderful, thank you.",179,,

562,0.97,3537.967,3543.039,How you will physically alter this land?,179,,
563,0.97,3543.039,3547.977,"The management plan actually, the purpose of the plan is to manage wildlife habitat.",180,,
564,0.97,3547.977,3555.151,It lays it out we are not to do much with the land.,180,,
565,0.97,3555.151,3567.63,"So, on this particular property, you know, we may, depending--we will do more work on the creek to see if we will approve it for salmon habitat.",180,,
566,0.97,3567.63,3568.932,It does cross to the South.,180,,
567,0.97,3568.932,3570.8,Private property before it joins the river.,180,,
568,0.97,3570.8,3582.779,We may have to work with that private Landowner if need be to get access there to improve that habitat.,180,,
569,0.97,3582.779,3599.128,"Normally we would--the maintenance, it is public land, open to the public but we want to keep any Trespassers there for other activities that are not allowed or we had problems with, you know, trash and that kind of stuff.",180,,
570,0.97,3599.128,3601.364,So we clean that up.,180,,
571,0.97,3601.364,3603.132,The parcel of land.,180,,

642,0.97,3893.656,3896.859,How did we get to where we are and where we have been.,210,,
643,0.97,3896.859,3901.731,"There was a law previous to this one that spoke about technologies, drones being one of them.",210,,
644,0.97,3901.731,3910.139,What it was trying to get to is having breaks over technology used for surveillance.,210,,
645,0.97,3910.139,3917.747,While the law was in place more technology became on the forefront.,210,,
646,0.97,3917.747,3920.75,One of them it is media analysis.,210,,
647,0.97,3920.75,3921.15,It became clear.,210,,
648,0.97,3921.15,3923.753,We need to expand.,210,,
649,0.97,3923.753,3928.257,That is what Gonzalez was leading.,210,,
650,0.97,3928.257,3928.891,Expand with it.,210,,
651,0.97,3928.891,3930.927,"In 2017, the surveillance took effect.",210,,
652,0.97,3930.927,3934.563,Looked to revise the law for the use of Technologies.,210,,
653,0.97,3934.563,3943.072,Not just call them out.,210,,
654,0.97,3943.072,3945.841,That is like playing Whac-A- mole on that.,210,,
655,0.97,3945.841,3948.077,Look at the impact on civil liberties.,210,,
656,0.97,3948.077,3952.581,That year we identified through a Self-Audit process.,210,,
657,0.97,3952.581,3956.952,Reporting out on behalf of the executive.,210,,
658,0.97,3956.952,3961.791,Identifying 29 Technologies throughout the city and four departments.,210,,
659,0.97,3961.791,3962.258,Down to 26.,210,,
660,0.97,3962.258,3969.699,Three of them ended up not being used and or were really owned by King County.,210,,
661,0.97,3969.699,3973.436,We had no oversight in out they were being used.,210,,
662,0.97,3973.436,3975.805,On the master list.,210,,
663,0.97,3975.805,3983.346,The ordinance was amended to add an Externalia advisory group.,210,,
664,0.97,3983.346,3995.958,Comprised of nominees from Council and the Mayor's office to provide a citizen's look from an impacted group and individuals perspective on surveillance.,210,,
665,0.97,3995.958,4005.101,"So, the Technologies Commenting on those and looking at the policies that oversee them and also advising on public engagement, part of the requirement here.",210,,
666,0.97,4005.101,4011.04,"In 2019, that was amend inside 2019.",211,,
667,0.97,4011.04,4011.407,Two approved.,211,,
668,0.97,4011.407,4013.175,One discussed later today after me.,211,,
669,0.97,4013.175,4019.815,Then we had a couple of Extense--extensions.,211,,
670,0.97,4019.815,4023.652,We were supposed to be done in 2020 when Covid-19 hit.,211,,
671,0.97,4023.652,4026.489,Had an extension until September.,211,,
672,0.97,4026.489,4033.028,We had been out of Commission we needed to extend it to March of this year.,211,,
673,0.97,4033.028,4035.798,That is a high-level of the ordinance.,211,,
674,0.97,4035.798,4037.433,I got it on one slide.,211,,
675,0.97,4037.433,4039.168,I was feeling proud of myself.,211,,
676,0.97,4039.168,4050.379,We wanted to represent part of our Seattle code a lot longer than this obviously.,211,,
677,0.97,4050.379,4065.995,"The definition is to Abserve and analyze individuals in a manner that is likely to raise concerns of civil liberties, freedom of speech or Association and social justice.",211,,
678,0.97,4065.995,4071.0,It expands the identifiable individuals to license plate and other records to identify people.,211,,
679,0.97,4071.0,4083.712,"Working with that is the definition, a set of exclusions, opt out is available it is not surveillance.",211,,
680,0.97,4083.712,4087.55,Police cameras are run under different policies.,211,,
681,0.97,4087.55,4092.621,"Cameras for traffic law, Red- light cameras, those things are excluded.",211,,
682,0.97,4092.621,4100.529,Security cameras on buildings or inside buildings there for security purposes clearly signed.,211,,
683,0.97,4100.529,4108.604,Anything we have on dams or critical infrastructure to act as a security camera.,211,,
684,0.97,4108.604,4110.673,Any technology that monitors city employees.,211,,
685,0.97,4110.673,4115.744,Anyone with a till with a camera that is something that is not included.,211,,
686,0.97,4115.744,4118.314,It speaks to the civil liberties.,211,,
687,0.97,4118.314,4122.751,I will not read all of these.,211,,
688,0.97,4122.751,4126.522,It is impact on disadvantaged groups.,211,,
689,0.97,4126.522,4133.295,Data that is collected in its intact form.,211,,
690,0.97,4133.295,4139.268,And civil liberty impacts.,211,,
691,0.97,4139.268,4141.07,That is what it is.,211,,
692,0.97,4141.07,4152.348,Those are the technology we identify that landed on the master list.,211,,
693,0.97,4152.348,4156.485,Councilmember Herbold.,212,,
694,0.97,4156.485,4167.162,"A quick question, the cameras--can you--what do you mean by security cameras?",213,,
695,0.97,4167.162,4168.531,Private security cameras?,213,,
696,0.97,4168.531,4178.14,"We have them in city hall, acting as security when individuals are not there to watch the property or they may be outside of the property but aimed in to watch who is going in and out.",213,,
697,0.97,4178.14,4180.743,"They are signed, security camera on premise.",213,,
698,0.97,4180.743,4187.216,It is different than the infrastructure protection cameras that are in places where there is nobody at all.,213,,
699,0.97,4187.216,4191.253,They are looking at dams and bridges and those kinds of things.,213,,
700,0.97,4191.253,4192.121,"All right, thank you.",214,,
701,0.97,4192.121,4192.421,Okay.,215,,
702,0.97,4192.421,4198.394,I will move along if there are any other questions let me know.,216,,
703,0.97,4198.394,4206.435,Surveillance impact reports are comprised of 6 but I will call it 7 because we have public engagement that I am calling out separately.,216,,
704,0.97,4206.435,4213.409,There is what a surveillance impact looks like.,216,,
705,0.97,4213.409,4214.043,Surveillance impact report.,216,,
706,0.97,4214.043,4223.085,Anything that is newly proposed to be acquired in advance of acquiring the technology needs to go through this process.,216,,
707,0.97,4223.085,4230.626,Some are asking 50 questions about data use and Shraeuring and management and security.,216,,
708,0.97,4230.626,4234.83,Financial information is a business case.,216,,
709,0.97,4234.83,4243.572,"Racial equity tool kit taking advantage of our initiative to look at racial impacts and disparity impacts, a public engagement portion.",216,,
710,0.97,4243.572,4248.877,For you all to take into consideration where the public is concerned.,216,,
711,0.97,4248.877,4252.514,Privacy and civil liberties is the piece that comes from the surveillance working group.,216,,
712,0.97,4252.514,4258.754,"These are the questions and concerns they may raise as a group about the technologies, policies and how it works.",216,,
713,0.97,4258.754,4262.424,Then the Cto has an opportunity to respond to any of those.,216,,
714,0.97,4262.424,4271.266,If there are changes proposed with policy or we feel they are concerned by other parts of the impact report.,216,,
715,0.97,4271.266,4279.608,And documentation those are things like here is the policy that governs what we talk about in section 4.3 and the detailed policies.,216,,
716,0.97,4279.608,4281.243,All of that bundled together.,216,,
717,0.97,4281.243,4286.915,The departments are the subject matter experts.,216,,
718,0.97,4286.915,4287.416,Operational technology.,216,,
719,0.97,4287.416,4288.283,We project manage this.,216,,
720,0.97,4288.283,4303.465,"I work with the folks from the Department to make sure they are readable English, answer the questions appropriately and pack it up and ready to present and we lead the public engagement piece.",216,,
721,0.97,4303.465,4304.333,Any questions on that?,216,,
722,0.97,4304.333,4305.968,Yes.,217,,
723,0.97,4305.968,4315.511,"Again, just a little bit more about the difference between 1 and 5. privacy impact statement and civil liberties impact.",218,,
724,0.97,4315.511,4322.384,The assessment is what we do when we look at anything with a high privacy risk.,219,,
725,0.97,4322.384,4326.288,We looked at all of the questions in the law.,219,,
726,0.97,4326.288,4328.657,A couple pages that the law.,219,,
727,0.97,4328.657,4336.598,"It out lines everything with data collection and how the technology is Operationallized how it is used, policy directed.",219,,
728,0.97,4336.598,4340.536,Everything we need to know about the technology used.,219,,
729,0.97,4340.536,4350.446,They look at all of that information and see fist--SEES if there are any concerns.,219,,
730,0.97,4350.446,4361.457,Policy that they feel may be beefed up or other issues they are raising about how the technology may be used.,219,,
731,0.97,4361.457,4362.758,Two different ways to look at.,219,,
732,0.97,4362.758,4371.5,It one is here it is and the other is here are the concerns and we want to raise your attention and ask questions about.,219,,
733,0.97,4371.5,4374.236,Does that answer that for you?,219,,
734,0.97,4374.236,4374.436,Okay.,219,,
735,0.97,4374.436,4374.636,Good.,219,,
736,0.97,4374.636,4379.441,These take time as you can imagine.,219,,
737,0.97,4379.441,4385.647,"So, 8-9 months depending on public engagement and how it goes and reviews and concerns and questions that may come up along the way.",219,,
738,0.97,4385.647,4395.724,"We draft it with the departments, they are the ones that I say I have four or five or 15 technologies and we draft the technologies to the questions.",219,,
739,0.97,4395.724,4398.46,We schedule public comment period.,219,,
740,0.97,4398.46,4400.028,Running those for 30 days.,219,,
741,0.97,4400.028,4407.703,"And, and depending on how many Technologies running public engagement so people have an opportunity to be introduced to the technology.",219,,
742,0.97,4407.703,4410.672,When we were in person we did it in the community.,219,,
743,0.97,4410.672,4412.107,Now we are doing these on-line.,219,,
744,0.97,4412.107,4413.976,That is what those are.,219,,
745,0.97,4413.976,4427.089,We take the public comment in the full form that is required to be turned in by law but we raise up questions and themes we want everyone to be aware of.,219,,
746,0.97,4427.089,4435.03,"We turn it over for 6-8 weeks, if they want a couple other weeks for the working group to come up with the impact assessment.",219,,
747,0.97,4435.03,4447.676,"Then, they take a couple weeks to look at that and see if there is response back, ideas, concerns to raise back about anything brought up in the working group.",219,,
748,0.97,4447.676,4456.552,That helps this body of Council that will see issues that are raised that we want to look at and what are the responses back from the technology.,219,,
749,0.97,4456.552,4466.395,Then we create what used to be a condenser now an overview to give you a shorter view.,219,,
750,0.97,4466.395,4478.207,"As you can imagine, maybe you can see these, they are thick when we get policy involved.",219,,
751,0.97,4478.207,4480.309,"So, we did a condensed version.",219,,
752,0.97,4480.309,4485.614,Drilling down into what you find interesting or what more on.,219,,
753,0.97,4485.614,4494.323,"We go through the review process, we hand it over and request for legislation to pass into and allow the technology to be continued to be used or new technology.",219,,
754,0.97,4494.323,4504.533,But new technology to allow it to be acquired and used.,219,,
755,0.97,4504.533,4505.1,And questions about that?,219,,
756,0.97,4505.1,4507.569,And that is not all that is required.,220,,
757,0.97,4507.569,4527.456,"That is what leads us into the next part of the conversation, David Jones and his team will talk about the audit conducted on one of the Technologies for Sdot.",220,,
758,0.97,4527.456,4528.657,All of the them.,220,,
759,0.97,4528.657,4534.93,"We will put a marker, that is what we are looking at right now.",220,,
760,0.97,4534.93,4539.968,All of the Technologies must be approved.,220,,
761,0.97,4539.968,4551.58,"Cto reports, I am the privacy office, I do more than surveillance, I spend time looking at all of the technology and do a privacy review and questions on surveillance.",220,,
762,0.97,4551.58,4557.853,"The quarterly report, here are all of the things acquired and why it was not surveillance or why?",220,,
763,0.97,4557.853,4565.827,All of that is in a report to Council and the working group.,220,,
764,0.97,4565.827,4567.129,Then is an equity report.,220,,
765,0.97,4567.129,4574.503,Are we meeting the goals of the law?,220,,
766,0.97,4574.503,4576.905,And the final bit.,220,,
767,0.97,4576.905,4586.949,The annual audit report of technologies of which there are 2. Cctv and license plate reader technology.,220,,
768,0.97,4586.949,4594.723,"That is the piece that has been conducted on one of the technologies, the license plate reader there are significant Tkpegzs coming from the auditor.",220,,
769,0.97,4594.723,4598.126,That is what I prepared for you today.,220,,
770,0.97,4598.126,4598.46,Excellent.,221,,
771,0.97,4598.46,4602.13,Thank you for that overview of the surveillance ordinance.,221,,
772,0.97,4602.13,4610.038,And what is in the Seattle municipal code and setting the table for the next item on the agenda.,221,,
773,0.97,4610.038,4617.913,"Councilmembers, any questions for information technology experts?",221,,
774,0.97,4617.913,4618.547,"Yes, Councilmember Herbold?",222,,
775,0.97,4618.547,4629.291,I just want to thank you for continuing to move towards the deadline under your current extension.,223,,
776,0.97,4629.291,4637.165,Despite the recognition that we might not get there I appreciate the effort to stick to that Phrafrp 2021 deadline.,223,,
777,0.97,4637.165,4638.3,And maybe we will get there.,223,,
778,0.97,4638.3,4638.667,[Laughter],223,,
779,0.97,4638.667,4640.168,Maybe we will get there.,224,,
780,0.97,4640.168,4642.971,Thank you for your support on that.,224,,
781,0.97,4642.971,4649.611,This continues to be something that we work very vigorously on and it is primary responsibility.,224,,
782,0.97,4649.611,4654.95,He is our hero here keeping this flag moving forward.,224,,
783,0.97,4654.95,4659.254,Any other questions for anyone here?,224,,
784,0.97,4659.254,4659.654,No pressure.,225,,
785,0.97,4659.654,4659.988,[Laughter],225,,
786,0.97,4659.988,4664.159,We are glad he is so excellent and keeps us moving.,226,,
787,0.97,4664.159,4665.093,"Thank you, both.",227,,
788,0.97,4665.093,4680.208,Really appreciate this overview and I think it is useful for the public and for us to reference it later and to be able to call both of you with questions as we get these reports and try to dig into them and protect.,227,,
789,0.97,4680.208,4685.947,Protect people's Praoeufacey and move forward with important technology advancements.,227,,
790,0.97,4685.947,4686.314,"So, thank you.",227,,
791,0.97,4686.314,4688.116,Certainly.,228,,
792,0.97,4688.116,4689.918,Thank you very much everyone.,228,,
793,0.97,4689.918,4690.619,Thank you.,229,,
794,0.97,4690.619,4692.521,Councilmembers we are on our last item.,230,,
795,0.97,4692.521,4699.127,So will the clerk read the title of item 20 into the record.,230,,
796,0.97,4699.127,4706.201,"Agenda item 20, city auditor's office, presentation of license plate readers audit for briefing and discussion.",231,,
797,0.97,4706.201,4708.336,Thank you.,232,,
798,0.97,4708.336,4720.849,And we are going to introduce David G. Jones and Megumi Sumitani.,232,,
799,0.97,4720.849,4724.553,Just a brief overview providing context.,232,,
800,0.97,4724.553,4730.959,I have the auditor is here and Sdot is going to be available for us as well.,232,,
801,0.97,4730.959,4741.97,As we know the city auditor conducts in-depth Analysises and develops recommendation to improve the city programs and services.,232,,
802,0.97,4741.97,4748.21,Appreciate them being here--analysis and develops recommendations to improve the city programs and services.,232,,
803,0.97,4748.21,4749.377,Appreciate them for being here.,232,,
804,0.97,4749.377,4753.215,It causes us to look back at the technology.,232,,
805,0.97,4753.215,4766.695,"These Audits have recommendations and as I understand Seattle Department of Transportation is in agreement with auditor's recommendations and there is some additional information, contacts that the auditor will provide about that.",232,,
806,0.97,4766.695,4774.903,"Again, this audit was required by the original 2017 ordinance.",232,,
807,0.97,4774.903,4783.912,Ordinance 123576 that requires a city auditor to look at City Council approved Nonpolice surveillance Technologies.,232,,
808,0.97,4783.912,4794.689,It is also required by another ordinance that approved the use of Sdot's license plate readers technology.,232,,
809,0.97,4794.689,4805.033,"Sdot license plate readers, Lpr technology is used for capturing license plate information to calculate the average time Onset set streets.",232,,
810,0.97,4805.033,4812.874,Lpr cameras are high-definition cameras designed to capture images of license plates.,232,,
811,0.97,4812.874,4820.949,It is processed by software that reports the number to the Washington state.,232,,
812,0.97,4820.949,4825.587,Travel time between the two locations and sends it back to Sdot.,232,,
813,0.97,4825.587,4839.634,"So they can post the travel time to the public on its various through various means on read side signs, travel information web map for the public to use and making informed trip decisions.",232,,
814,0.97,4839.634,4846.641,"With the hope of reducing traffic congestion and limited Partnering people get to work, school, other destinations on time.",232,,
815,0.97,4846.641,4851.146,So we will turn this over to the auditor's office.,232,,
816,0.97,4851.146,4855.383,Thank you for being here.,232,,
817,0.97,4855.383,4867.295,"Thank you, chair Pederson for inviting us here to talk about our report on the Seattle transportation license plate reader technology.",233,,
818,0.97,4867.295,4873.301,We will refer to it Seattle Department of transportation as Sdot.,233,,
819,0.97,4873.301,4897.425,"For members of the public who are watching this presentation our report is available on the office of city auditor web site, Ww W.Seattle.Gov/Cityaudittor and our report on license plate reader cameras which I will refer to and Megumi Sumitani will refer to it as Lprs.",233,,
820,0.97,4897.425,4927.489,This report that we are talking about today it is the first in a series of reports that the surveillance technology ordinance requires our office and Inspector General for public safety to have the use on surveillance Technologies our office is charged with handling the Nonpolice surveillance?,233,,
821,0.97,4927.489,4931.826,The Office of Inspector General will handle the surveillance.,233,,
822,0.97,4931.826,4943.972,"Before I Thapbd over to Megumi I would--hand it over to Megumi I would like to make three reports, before we hand over our report, we want to make sure we get it right.",233,,
823,0.97,4943.972,4946.541,We share it with Whoever we are auditing.,233,,
824,0.97,4946.541,4971.032,After we have done this and shared the draft Sdot decided to Speedup the replacement of their license plate reader cameras with another technology so all of the cameras will be replaced by the end of 2021.,233,,
825,0.97,4971.032,4976.404,"Now, Sdot as chair Pederson said, agreed with all of our recommendations and logic behind them.",233,,
826,0.97,4976.404,4989.017,Because they are deciding to move away from the Lpr technology by the end of this year it means it may not make sense and it may not fully implement all of our recommendations because the technology is going away.,233,,
827,0.97,4989.017,4999.527,"However, rest assured we will be following up on their implementation of our recommendations and we will report back to you, the city Council and the public, about this.",233,,
828,0.97,4999.527,5009.003,Second point I want to make is our office is currently scheduled to review the replacement technology.,233,,
829,0.97,5009.003,5020.982,The current plan calls for us to review this technology after the city council in accordance with the process to find in the surveillance technology ordinance reviews it.,233,,
830,0.97,5020.982,5022.15,My third and final point.,233,,
831,0.97,5022.15,5036.131,I just want to mention when we started this audit we had funding to contract when experience technology security firm to help us with some of the more technology aspects of the technology.,233,,
832,0.97,5036.131,5046.941,"However, due to the budget crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic we had to close this contract before the contract had or the consultant could complete their work.",233,,
833,0.97,5046.941,5062.624,"Because of it you know there is a recommendation in the report that calls for entity with it security expertise to evaluate the technology risks, the risk that the data could be lost or accessed.",233,,
834,0.97,5062.624,5064.459,"So, we have a recommendation calling for that.",233,,
835,0.97,5064.459,5073.301,"Good news is that we heard so far, Sdot told us they are working with city and it security staff to evaluate and address these risks.",233,,
836,0.97,5073.301,5087.248,Now what I would like to do is turn it over to Megumi Sumitani who will take us through the details of the report.,233,,
837,0.97,5087.248,5087.849,Megumi?,233,,
838,0.97,5087.849,5088.55,"Thank you, David.",234,,
839,0.97,5088.55,5089.684,This is the second slide.,234,,
840,0.97,5089.684,5097.325,Is that what is showing right now?,234,,
841,0.97,5097.325,5097.892,Yes.,235,,
842,0.97,5097.892,5098.293,"Okay, thank you.",235,,
843,0.97,5098.293,5112.941,We are here to present to you highlights of our first usage review of Seattle transportation license plate readers technology as required by the 2017 surveillance technology ordinance.,235,,
844,0.97,5112.941,5120.215,"The surveillance ordinance specifies that at a minimum that the annual usage reports, report on these 6 areas.",235,,
845,0.97,5120.215,5128.857,"And, I know there is a lot of text on the slide but we wanted to put the actual text from the ordinance here so the public can see it.",235,,
846,0.97,5128.857,5138.099,"But, very briefly stated what we were asked to report on are a, the Technologies use, frequency and patterns.",235,,
847,0.97,5138.099,5155.617,"B, sharing effort technology or its data, C, data management protocols, D, impact on civil liberties, E, complaints, and f, cost of the technology.",235,,
848,0.97,5155.617,5161.489,And our report is set up so it responds to these questions in this sequence.,235,,
849,0.97,5161.489,5163.725,We will make our presentation following that sequence.,235,,
850,0.97,5163.725,5169.998,I am sorry I went on to the other slide too quickly.,235,,
851,0.97,5169.998,5182.844,"So, on this slide before we get into each of the ordinance questions I wanted to provide you a brief overview of the technology and then the four key Takeaways from the audit.",235,,
852,0.97,5182.844,5185.68,"First, a brief overview of the technology.",235,,
853,0.97,5185.68,5208.102,This is a very basic diagram showing the data flowing from Sdot through the Washington State Department of transportation and I will refer to it as W Sdot.,235,,
854,0.97,5208.102,5212.14,There is a detail of the flow in the report.,235,,
855,0.97,5212.14,5229.924,"So, basically the technology is used to take a picture of the traffic going through one point and measuring how long it takes to get to another point and there is Wsdot software that matching the license plate and returns the average travel time between license plate readings.",235,,
856,0.97,5229.924,5241.636,Very briefly starting from the lower left corner of the slide the Lpr cameras and software are used to capture the images of the license plates as they move into view.,235,,
857,0.97,5241.636,5252.914,"These images are converted into raw data such as the license plate letters and numbers, time and location which are then sent to Wsdot to produce the travel time.",235,,
858,0.97,5252.914,5265.526,"It is the raw data, not the images, that are transmitted through a dedicated fiber optic network between Sdot and Wsdot.",235,,
859,0.97,5265.526,5281.743,They process the travel time between intersections and transfers the information to Sdot that shares the information to the public through its dynamic message signs and web site.,236,,
860,0.97,5281.743,5293.621,"They use travel time for some of its own purposes such as traffic engineering and planning the studies, the technology is used by Sdot to share the information with the public.",236,,
861,0.97,5293.621,5298.893,"So, the public can make informed trip decisions.",236,,
862,0.97,5298.893,5307.301,"And as of June 2020, there were 100Lpr cameras operating in the city.",236,,
863,0.97,5307.301,5315.91,Sdot has been using the technology and does not plan to get more cameras.,236,,
864,0.97,5315.91,5324.485,"So, while they have been maintaining and repairing the cameras the Department has been phasing them out because they are out there, quote Unquote, end of life.",236,,
865,0.97,5324.485,5334.429,And no longer supported by the manufacture.,236,,
866,0.97,5334.429,5341.035,If it needed to be replaced they replace it with another.,236,,
867,0.97,5341.035,5352.947,As stated earlier by David Sdot plans to replace all of the Lpr with the other units by the end of this year.,236,,
868,0.97,5352.947,5357.885,I would like to talk about our key Takeaways.,236,,
869,0.97,5357.885,5371.632,"Two key issues, it is because Sdot sends and relies on Wsdot to process the data that the lack of a written Data-Sharing agreement with Wsdot is the first key finding in this audit.",236,,
870,0.97,5371.632,5379.373,We recommended that Sdot develop and execute a written Data-Sharing agreement with Wsdot.,236,,
871,0.97,5379.373,5392.553,"However, because they plan to phase them out by the end of this year they indicated they may not implement this recommendation.",236,,
872,0.97,5392.553,5401.696,The second there could be Cybersecurity vulnerability in the license plate reading itself.,236,,
873,0.97,5401.696,5424.752,It is improperly share that can liberties . Ntial civil - because of this risk and we are not it experts we recommended Sdot get Cybersecurity experts in the city's information technology Department or consultants to conduct it.,236,,
874,0.97,5424.752,5427.488,There are other issues in two areas.,236,,
875,0.97,5427.488,5452.547,"First, the need for policies to be updated or revised to reflect actual practices by Sdot and Wsdot and Secondly, there is a need to resolve between the policy documents, the Seurbgs Sir and the Csir.",236,,
876,0.97,5452.547,5469.897,It provides information about the technology and purpose and use and policies and the Csir called the condensed surveillance impact report is a condensed version of the Sir that calls out the policies from it.,236,,
877,0.97,5469.897,5476.37,As ginger mentioned earlier the Csir is renamed as the executive overview report.,236,,
878,0.97,5476.37,5481.976,We make nine recommendations to address our findings.,236,,
879,0.97,5481.976,5488.316,I would like to take you through the key Takeaways through each of the six questions.,236,,
880,0.97,5488.316,5494.021,Starting with question a on the Technologies use.,236,,
881,0.97,5494.021,5496.324,We have three key Takeaways.,236,,
882,0.97,5496.324,5519.013,"The technology is being used in accordance with Sdots permitted purposes, two, the Department is not using the technology for enforcement purposes and we would like to point out here that recently installed cameras on the West Seattle low bridge are not Sdot's Lpr cameras.",236,,
883,0.97,5519.013,5519.947,They are SPD.,236,,
884,0.97,5519.947,5528.422,Seattle police Department enforcement cameras like a Red- light camera and they are out of scope for this review.,236,,
885,0.97,5528.422,5536.264,"And thirdly, the Lpr cameras near use 24 hours a day, every day, transferring data to Wsdot.",236,,
886,0.97,5536.264,5549.243,"Question B is about how often the technology or its data are shared with other entities, in particular other governments.",236,,
887,0.97,5549.243,5555.049,"Three key Takeaways, Sdot is sharing with Wsdot continuously.",237,,
888,0.97,5555.049,5561.055,As required there is no written agreement between them.,237,,
889,0.97,5561.055,5581.542,"Two, operational policies state that Wdot Deletes data when travel times are calculated and that Wsdot does not hold the data.",237,,
890,0.97,5581.542,5597.858,Operational policies also state that raw data shall not be stored or used by Sdot or any other entity for any purpose other than traffic management and only Sdot and Wsdot can access the data.,237,,
891,0.97,5597.858,5610.571,"However, we were not able to verify or fully assess this due to the lack of technical expertise.",237,,
892,0.97,5610.571,5621.949,It is possible that it could be shared.,237,,
893,0.97,5621.949,5623.417,And engage Cyberexperts to address issues.,237,,
894,0.97,5623.417,5629.59,We believe it will reduce the chance that these risks will occur.,237,,
895,0.97,5629.59,5629.89,Megumi.,238,,
896,0.97,5629.89,5636.597,"I would like to make it clear we have no evidence, we did not learn anything during our audit this, indeed, has happened.",238,,
897,0.97,5636.597,5653.948,"What we are trying to say is to really get even greater proof or evidence, better evidence, you know, you need to engage people who are it security experts to do that to make a statement.",238,,
898,0.97,5653.948,5658.285,We did not uncover any evidence that leakage has happened.,238,,
899,0.97,5658.285,5659.053,Go ahead Megumi.,238,,
900,0.97,5659.053,5662.456,"Yeah, thank you, thank you.",239,,
901,0.97,5662.456,5672.233,"So the next question, question C is about data management protocols.",240,,
902,0.97,5672.233,5675.803,"5 key Takeaways, one, the system was installed 10 years ago.",240,,
903,0.97,5675.803,5681.842,Due to lack of records we could not determine if qualified personnel installed the system.,240,,
904,0.97,5681.842,5689.05,"Two, access to the system is properly limited to certain personnel for configuration and trouble shooting purposes.",240,,
905,0.97,5689.05,5698.793,"Three, that access to the system is protected according to the policy with the user name and pass work.",240,,
906,0.97,5698.793,5706.033,Or what it means for standard training for those that use the system and who is required to take that Strandard training.,240,,
907,0.97,5706.033,5712.306,"And five, that no images of vehicles and occupants are supposed to be collected by Sdot.",240,,
908,0.97,5712.306,5732.96,"We saw that, the cameras are appropriately directed to capture license plates, however, we saw in the process of capturing those license plate images, the cameras captured a sufficient amount of the body of the vehicles to be able to surmise the vehicle's color, make and model.",240,,
909,0.97,5732.96,5742.737,And to this point we made a recommendation what is meant by images of vehicles and to define the limits of what can be captured in the images.,240,,
910,0.97,5742.737,5750.444,Although the images are not transmitted to Wsdot they are held temporarily in the cameras before they are deleted.,240,,
911,0.97,5750.444,5755.449,It poses a risk of their being improperly shared risk.,240,,
912,0.97,5755.449,5760.254,And here are some sample images from an Sdot Lpr camera.,240,,
913,0.97,5760.254,5763.257,The license plates were obscured by us.,240,,
914,0.97,5763.257,5767.795,"So, again, these images are not transmitted to Wsdot.",240,,
915,0.97,5767.795,5783.043,"Only raw data such as the number, time, location data are transmitted.",240,,
916,0.97,5783.043,5789.95,"Ordinance question D., how it could have an effect on disproportionate representations.",240,,
917,0.97,5789.95,5811.071,If it could impact civil liberties as stated earlier there is a risk that the system could result in data being shared with unauthorized parties and as a result effect civil liberties and as mentioned earlier we recommended that it security experts be engaged to assess the Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities of the system.,241,,
918,0.97,5811.071,5830.891,"And in terms of the locations of where the cameras were deployed and if deployment in those locations could impact civil liberties, policies state that the locations should be based on Street transportation volumes volumes and gaps and travel time coverage.",241,,
919,0.97,5830.891,5841.769,They don't have a record showing why the cameras were placed where they were we were not able to determine if the locations they chose were according to policy.,241,,
920,0.97,5841.769,5848.342,"Still, we wanted to see what we could learn about how the cameras are placed throughout the city.",241,,
921,0.97,5848.342,5857.851,"So, we worked with the Department of information technology and the city Demographer to map it to see if coming jumped out at us.",241,,
922,0.97,5857.851,5863.524,"We could, we should point out that we mapped only the Lpr cameras.",241,,
923,0.97,5863.524,5875.069,It is just one peace of the larger network of surveillance technology including Sdot uses.,241,,
924,0.97,5875.069,5895.289,"In terms of mapping of the Lpr cameras two observations are that one, over 40% of the cameras are located in two census tracks, track 93, in parts of Pioneer square and track 109 that is Georgetown.",241,,
925,0.97,5895.289,5902.096,Both of which are in industrial areas where the population density is low.,241,,
926,0.97,5902.096,5918.612,"That, too, they have a higher--you know, it is low in the tracks they have higher disproportionate residents according to other.",241,,
927,0.97,5918.612,5941.435,"Ordinance question E. is about concerns and assessments and we did not identify any privacy or civil liberties related, complaints, concerns about the Lpr system received by the Department by Sdot or the city's customer service Bureau between 2017 and June of 2020.",241,,
928,0.97,5941.435,5953.747,Over the past five years there was one security assessment related to the Lpr system done in 2015 by a consultant.,241,,
929,0.97,5953.747,5957.785,As for the costs and the technology that was the last question we were asked to look at.,241,,
930,0.97,5957.785,5964.658,As you can see it was a small amount of money involved for this technology in 2019.,241,,
931,0.97,5964.658,5968.362,And for the first half of 2020.,241,,
932,0.97,5973.934,5977.871,Sdot concurred with our findings and recommendations.,241,,
933,0.97,5977.871,5994.955,"Since Sdot has decided to terminate use of the Lpr technology by the end of this year, this means that the Department will need to determine the extent of resources that should be devoted to their implementation or if to implement them at all.",241,,
934,0.97,5994.955,6010.204,"However, until the technology is completely phased out it is still important that Sdot and itd ensure that the data and system are appropriately protected.",241,,
935,0.97,6010.204,6018.145,As part of our follow up work we look at the STAS us for each of the nine recommendations from this audit.,241,,
936,0.97,6018.145,6025.686,In closing we would like to thank the Department of Seattle for their work with us on this audit.,242,,
937,0.97,6025.686,6032.559,"Committee members let us know if you have questions, thank you.",242,,
938,0.97,6032.559,6033.961,"Thank you, Megumi.",243,,
939,0.97,6033.961,6036.13,"Thank you, auditor Jones.",244,,
940,0.97,6036.13,6044.838,Councilmembers any questions about there report today?,244,,
941,0.97,6044.838,6045.906,Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Morales.,244,,
942,0.97,6048.208,6056.05,And we do have Sdot here to answer questions as well.,245,,
943,0.97,6056.05,6063.39,"So, I appreciate that.",245,,
944,0.97,6063.39,6064.358,Please Councilmember Herbold.,245,,
945,0.97,6064.358,6064.825,Thank you.,246,,
946,0.97,6064.825,6073.7,I am a little confused about the implications of phasing out from the Lpr technology.,246,,
947,0.97,6073.7,6081.942,Does it mean that they are phasing out from the use of this technology or this function all together?,246,,
948,0.97,6081.942,6090.851,And they are just going to shift to a different technology to continue this function?,246,,
949,0.97,6090.851,6093.987,"I believe the answer is yes, they are just switching.",247,,
950,0.97,6093.987,6100.194,They are going to stop using Lpr cameras but replace them.,247,,
951,0.97,6100.194,6112.906,"So, the same function, if you will, create travel times and posting them and going public they will continue to do that.",247,,
952,0.97,6112.906,6117.211,I defer if you want to add more.,247,,
953,0.97,6117.211,6117.578,Thank you.,248,,
954,0.97,6117.578,6117.911,,249,,
955,0.97,6117.911,6118.612,"Thank you, yes.",250,,
956,0.97,6118.612,6127.187,I just wanted to add a little bit more.,251,,
957,0.97,6127.187,6128.021,Thank you.,251,,
958,0.97,6128.021,6130.891,I am Adiam Emery that manages the technology.,251,,
959,0.97,6130.891,6140.567,I want to highlight the items NOTE inside this audit are primarily related to agreement and not risk privacy data.,251,,
960,0.97,6140.567,6147.541,Lpr is 10 years old and it has been the life cycle for this is seven years.,251,,
961,0.97,6147.541,6154.181,We have been in the process of phasing it out.,251,,
962,0.97,6154.181,6163.19,We introduced a new technology five years ago and Transitioning to this new technology as the Equipments fail.,251,,
963,0.97,6163.19,6188.649,"But, due to the recommendation through the audit office and--in order to establish the agreements with Wsdot it would of required us a lot of investment to create a training process, program for Wsdot employees.",251,,
964,0.97,6188.649,6194.988,Developing the training for Wsdot to Speedup the replacement of this equipment which was planned.,251,,
965,0.97,6194.988,6204.331,We just wanted to take our time as the equipment fail and replacing it in the new technology.,251,,
966,0.97,6204.331,6208.835,We decided to expedite that and make it the end of this year.,251,,
967,0.97,6208.835,6220.948,I thought I heard relating to the mapping exercise unable to provide information how those locations were selected.,252,,
968,0.97,6220.948,6250.744,"And, so, the question that I have is if you are going to replace the Lpr technology are you going to do so in the same location or a different process of identifying locations for the use of this technology and gathering this information?",252,,
969,0.97,6250.744,6251.411,[everyone talking at once],252,,
970,0.97,6251.411,6254.982,A little bit of background in the technology 10 years ago.,253,,
971,0.97,6254.982,6268.862,This is the first in the nation to actually measure travel time on the streets?,253,,
972,0.97,6268.862,6278.705,"We looked at Aurora, Seattle bridge, and 15th Avenue Northwest.",253,,
973,0.97,6278.705,6279.64,All of those.,253,,
974,0.97,6279.64,6283.477,And then marginal and--4TH Avenue they were where it was selected.,253,,
975,0.97,6283.477,6285.412,That was the first launch.,253,,
976,0.97,6285.412,6299.092,We will be replacing them in those primary principal places as it has a significant return on measuring travel time on those primary corridors.,253,,
977,0.97,6299.092,6309.002,And the auditor can feel free to jump in at any time.,254,,
978,0.97,6309.002,6309.536,Megumi go ahead.,254,,
979,0.97,6309.536,6331.058,"Actually, Adiam responded already but I just wanted to state that it was our understanding that by phasing out the Lprs right now that they are going to be replaced in their existing locations.",255,,
980,0.97,6331.058,6332.759,As she just responded.,255,,
981,0.97,6332.759,6343.537,"As far as any new technology that is, you know, that is something for the future in terms of maybe something that we might be looking at, Yeah.",255,,
982,0.97,6343.537,6358.218,"What kinds of reasons that they will be placing them in New locations will be something that could be looked at that time, yes.",255,,
983,0.97,6358.218,6358.385,--,255,,
984,0.97,6358.385,6366.493,"I am, again, I think through the mapping exercise.",256,,
985,0.97,6366.493,6371.598,I will defer to Councilmember Morales on this for more follow up.,256,,
986,0.97,6371.598,6392.786,The reason I am asking is--it is noting that 40% of the locations are in two census tracks.,256,,
987,0.97,6392.786,6403.997,And I don't think they are located in those census tracks.,256,,
988,0.97,6403.997,6407.067,It might be needing to know why.,256,,
989,0.97,6407.067,6419.079,If I could just--ask a couple other questions less about the location.,256,,
990,0.97,6419.079,6427.354,I want to confirm that Wsdot uses --,256,,
991,0.97,6427.354,6427.921,Yes.,257,,
992,0.97,6427.921,6428.221,Yes.,258,,
993,0.97,6428.221,6429.456,"Adiam, please.",258,,
994,0.97,6429.456,6430.49,They don't.,259,,
995,0.97,6430.49,6440.367,"When we launched this 10 years ago, it Wases to contain it.",259,,
996,0.97,6440.367,6443.67,At that time Wsdot used Lpr.,259,,
997,0.97,6443.67,6459.386,"We wanted to create, without creating city boundaries and having a Streamless, like, you know, travel time being measured in our great cities we partnered with Wsdot to partner it 10 years ago.",259,,
998,0.97,6459.386,6463.089,And they currently do not use it.,259,,
999,0.97,6463.089,6473.266,They are not doing any travel time measurement in the areas where they were--where they had the Lpr launched at that time.,259,,
1000,0.97,6473.266,6492.319,They primarily focus on travel time Methology on the highway and maintain the highway travel time deployment and implementation instead of.,259,,
1001,0.97,6492.319,6493.587,They are continuing to use Lpr?,260,,
1002,0.97,6493.587,6500.961,They are phasing it out and moving out of measuring it and just focusing on the highway.,261,,
1003,0.97,6500.961,6502.863,I see.,262,,
1004,0.97,6502.863,6503.063,Okay.,262,,
1005,0.97,6503.063,6505.031,I have a couple other questions.,262,,
1006,0.97,6505.031,6508.535,I will defer to other folks here.,262,,
1007,0.97,6508.535,6513.807,"We can go to Councilmember morale, and go back to you Councilmember Herbold.",263,,
1008,0.97,6513.807,6515.509,Thank you.,264,,
1009,0.97,6515.509,6524.384,I have questions in two buckets the first is why we are doing this at all.,264,,
1010,0.97,6524.384,6545.605,"So, I understand--I mean I understand it was to calculate travel times sounds like from the city's perspective on Artirials but now they are going to only highways.",264,,
1011,0.97,6545.605,6560.086,"It does not matter if the two Technologies work together or not but my real question is, is, if we are using this technology for the purpose of calculating travel time to what end?",264,,
1012,0.97,6560.086,6566.259,So what do we do with that information?,264,,
1013,0.97,6566.259,6569.195,Is it to create recommendations for changing infrastructure?,264,,
1014,0.97,6569.195,6578.438,"Or, you know, how do we use the information?",264,,
1015,0.97,6578.438,6626.92,"And then getting back to more of the bigger questions Megumi I think you said SPD uses red light cameras, Sdot is using other kinds of cameras but for me it RAISES a bigger question about kind of bulk surveillance of our neighbors and who owns the equipment, who owns the data that is collected and are there problems with, you know f we are using Federal money for some of the equipment, they are usually pretty strict how it be used and I heard that there is a fear that SPD is collecting the data.",264,,
1016,0.97,6626.92,6644.204,I think there is a lot of concern about what happens to this information and who uses it and for what purposes.,264,,
1017,0.97,6644.204,6659.386,I did want to make the clarification that the technology is separate from the cameras that are being used for example on the West Seattle low bridge.,264,,
1018,0.97,6659.386,6678.204,"And, with our work with Sdot and with Wsdot on this technology, the data, it is just flowing through and then, being--the average travel times are being posted for public consumption for the most part.",264,,
1019,0.97,6678.204,6692.018,Something like 95% of the work that is related.,264,,
1020,0.97,6692.018,6701.127,Sdot uses it for purposes like for traffic studies and things like that.,264,,
1021,0.97,6701.127,6740.266,"And it is--it is data that has already been processed by Wsdot, in other words it is not raw data collected and then crunched by Sdot but it is raw data that is sent to Wsdot and they are coming back to Sdot and giving Sdot travel time information and they are using it for a variety of purposes primarily for public posting of how long it takes to get from one place to another.",264,,
1022,0.97,6740.266,6740.867,Councilmember Morales.,265,,
1023,0.97,6740.867,6749.609,"What is confusing to the public and I totally understand and there are concerns about what is done with the data, who owns it.",265,,
1024,0.97,6749.609,6756.382,"Sort of adding to the confusion, lots of different types of cameras used in the city?",265,,
1025,0.97,6756.382,6775.568,In a couple of by no later than the end of the next quarter we will be coming back to do a report on closed-circuit TVs that are operated by Sdot and those are traffic cameras that serve a different purpose than these license plate reader cameras.,265,,
1026,0.97,6775.568,6798.358,"So, I can understand community concerns about, you know, all of the cameras out there, Wsdot has cameras, the police Department has cameras, Sdot has cameras, that is part of the point of the surveillance ordinance to make sure there are controls in place to make sure the data is protected but it is a policy question, you know, about--that you ask to what end do we do it?",265,,
1027,0.97,6798.358,6800.593,And is it worth the risk?,265,,
1028,0.97,6800.593,6808.601,And I should say just adding one thing but adding context.,265,,
1029,0.97,6808.601,6809.669,Focusing on this technology.,265,,
1030,0.97,6809.669,6815.441,You always--one thing that we did not address in this report.,265,,
1031,0.97,6815.441,6819.279,We had--are there easier ways for someone to get this type of data.,265,,
1032,0.97,6819.279,6829.789,Some of the data is for sale.,265,,
1033,0.97,6831.624,6835.962,They sell information like companies that Repossess cars for example.,265,,
1034,0.97,6835.962,6846.873,We did not try to answer that question in this report about--are there easier ways for someone to get this data than taking it out the system.,265,,
1035,0.97,6846.873,6850.21,We were just looking tat within the confines of the system.,265,,
1036,0.97,6850.21,6852.011,Can I ask one more question.,266,,
1037,0.97,6852.011,6862.522,Can we go back to the costs?,266,,
1038,0.97,6863.69,6863.856,Yes.,267,,
1039,0.97,6863.856,6865.058,I am there.,268,,
1040,0.97,6865.058,6867.393,For me it does raise --,269,,
1041,0.97,6867.393,6867.66,Yes.,270,,
1042,0.97,6867.66,6893.92,"It raises the questions, again, about, you know, to Herbold's point was there any racial equity analysis done in where the cameras are placed and I understand for this purpose it is really just about determining travel time but given the reality there are lots of cameras and community feels like they are being Surveilled, overly Surveilled already.",271,,
1043,0.97,6893.92,6906.165,How do we make sure we are keeping that in mind when we make decisions about where to put or even replace cameras and if there are better ways to do that.,271,,
1044,0.97,6906.165,6910.503,"And the second is, how much are we spending on all of these cameras?",271,,
1045,0.97,6910.503,6942.535,"Is there a better use of some of these resources, you know, we just heard from the pedestrian advisory board and the bicycle advisory board, are there investments in infrastructure we could be making to make it safer for people who are not in cars or that might make it faster for people to travel because we are using our money in a way that supports a different kind of infrastructure not just car infrastructure.",271,,
1046,0.97,6942.535,6944.037,Those are bigger conversations for us to have.,271,,
1047,0.97,6944.037,6952.745,Just for me it is raising a lot of questions about if this is the right investment for us to be making in the community.,271,,
1048,0.97,6952.745,6953.579,"I see, yes.",272,,
1049,0.97,6953.579,6960.353,And I would like to answer 3 of your questions.,273,,
1050,0.97,6960.353,6963.423,Initially let me just address the enforcement.,273,,
1051,0.97,6963.423,6976.602,It is--they give us the state law giving us permission to do the enforcement and the engineering process of the automated enforcement.,273,,
1052,0.97,6976.602,6983.976,"So, that principal is run by SPD and they hire--it is a third party company that processes it.",273,,
1053,0.97,6983.976,6992.852,"It is not an Lpr it is a camera technology as David stated many, many different cameras.",273,,
1054,0.97,6992.852,7015.041,"And, red lighten Forcement, the school speed zone, they are great safety issues that we have launched, we launched for this thing and there is a pilot for transit Lane and then also block the box for three years that the legislation provided us a pilot project to roll it out.",273,,
1055,0.97,7015.041,7024.884,The lower Spokane bridge that is technology that we are using to identify authorized users to cross that bridge and so forth that we just launched recently.,273,,
1056,0.97,7024.884,7026.986,So that is the automated enforcement.,273,,
1057,0.97,7026.986,7029.889,You asked about how data is being used.,273,,
1058,0.97,7029.889,7051.477,"So I will use the recent Seattle bridge closure and how we came up with a mitigation plan to support businesses, support freight, transit movement for the peninsula and we outfitted all of the routes identified to get people in and out of this Peninsula using travel time.",273,,
1059,0.97,7051.477,7066.859,"It is a measure that we use significantly to identify capacity analysis, who gets to use the lower Spokane bridge, all of the policy that has been driven it is using those data and calculating what the capacity analysis should be.",273,,
1060,0.97,7066.859,7092.185,We have a task force set aside to understand immediate business impact and Maritime impact and this is the data we use consistently to come up with Data-Driven policies to support impacted communities like South park and Georgetown and so forth to give them access both to transit and freight and so forth.,273,,
1061,0.97,7092.185,7093.853,This is a very crucial thing.,273,,
1062,0.97,7093.853,7106.766,"It is not a car moving, it is a data that we use to have a sustainable reliable network and a spike in all modes.",273,,
1063,0.97,7106.766,7110.67,"And are also in a place, a planning trip and so forth.",273,,
1064,0.97,7110.67,7125.551,"It helps us assess how we allocate the Right-Of-Way, creating bike lanes and all of those factors are element that are supported by this data.",273,,
1065,0.97,7125.551,7128.721,"You asked about, this investment is worthwhile?",273,,
1066,0.97,7128.721,7147.273,"The investment comes in with when we manage the network in a more stable manner for transit reliability, impacted industry such as the Maritime and West Seattle businesses that we have been hearing continuously and making sure access is adequate.",273,,
1067,0.97,7147.273,7156.682,Equity manner distributed to have access to the lower Spokane bridge that gives them more closer touch point to their businesses and access.,273,,
1068,0.97,7156.682,7164.09,"So, that, that is how I wanted to--I just wanted to share those elements that we use.",273,,
1069,0.97,7164.09,7177.87,"And I just want to also employ Saoeus the--emphasize, the license plate, the data is never kept.",273,,
1070,0.97,7177.87,7178.271,The travel time.,273,,
1071,0.97,7178.271,7183.209,That we utilize to serve as all of those things.,273,,
1072,0.97,7183.209,7185.545,"They take privacy very, very seriously.",273,,
1073,0.97,7185.545,7204.397,"Being the leading Department here and with the 3 Technologies identified to go through this process, we, even 10 years ago we thought about privacy and figuring out that not to keep PII without the surveillance ordinance present at that time.",273,,
1074,0.97,7204.397,7209.435,So I just want to emphasize that data is crucial.,273,,
1075,0.97,7209.435,7212.338,We make the decision on safety.,273,,
1076,0.97,7212.338,7217.176,Efficiency for all modes using this particular data.,273,,
1077,0.97,7220.546,7223.249,Thank you.,274,,
1078,0.97,7223.249,7224.55,Thank you.,275,,
1079,0.97,7224.55,7226.752,"Thank you, Adiam.",276,,
1080,0.97,7226.752,7231.424,"Good and important questions, really appreciate this and the responses.",277,,
1081,0.97,7231.424,7244.337,"And it is nice that we, if we do have follow up questions we know the auditor will keep track of this for us and then Sdot is available to us to answer questions as well.",277,,
1082,0.97,7244.337,7246.706,Councilmembers any other questions?,277,,
1083,0.97,7246.706,7247.206,Councilmember Strauss?,277,,
1084,0.97,7247.206,7248.441,"Thank you, chair.",278,,
1085,0.97,7248.441,7254.28,"And thank you auditor Jones and Megumi, Adiam it is always great to see you.",278,,
1086,0.97,7254.28,7256.115,Thank you for this report.,278,,
1087,0.97,7256.115,7261.153,"I guess, just putting a finer tip on it and you may of addressed it but I wanted to pull it out.",278,,
1088,0.97,7261.153,7271.831,What would you say is the most important recommendation that we solve for today and what do we need to do in the short term?,278,,
1089,0.97,7271.831,7281.574,What is the first thing we need to get going on?,278,,
1090,0.97,7281.574,7283.776,We need to expedite it.,279,,
1091,0.97,7283.776,7287.346,I want to mention that Wsdot does not have the surveillance ordinance.,279,,
1092,0.97,7287.346,7293.919,There is no reason for them to invest in it.,279,,
1093,0.97,7293.919,7313.339,So understanding those things and us balancing the return of investment to spend money on something that we are phasing out to create training practices and so forth are the financial decision that we make to expedite and Transitioning it as quick as possible.,279,,
1094,0.97,7313.339,7316.275,"So, and then the rest of them.",279,,
1095,0.97,7316.275,7324.45,So that is the two recommendations about the training and data agreement with Wsdot that we would like to honor.,279,,
1096,0.97,7324.45,7336.429,"If we cannot land there, and then the rest of it is more of documentation alignment and wording and so forth that we need to kind of follow up with it to demonstrate.",279,,
1097,0.97,7336.429,7342.568,I always want to talk about network security.,279,,
1098,0.97,7342.568,7359.351,Jason is here to talk about--we have actually invested in getting a private consultant to come in and do an audit on our Street network and implemented a lot of the recommendations.,279,,
1099,0.97,7359.351,7376.902,We work closely with it to continuously maintain so if we are worry about hacking on those cameras and so forth we have a great process and partnership and touch point with it that we continuously need to monitor our net work.,279,,
1100,0.97,7376.902,7385.444,Not just for the Lpr but all of the traffic cameras that you will be hearing about Down-The- line.,279,,
1101,0.97,7385.444,7389.515,And other Traffic-Related devices such as traffic signals and stuff.,279,,
1102,0.97,7389.515,7391.35,"But, we take security very seriously.",279,,
1103,0.97,7391.35,7396.789,"But, Jason do you want to add coming on that NOTE?",279,,
1104,0.97,7396.789,7397.089,Thanks.,280,,
1105,0.97,7397.089,7398.157,"Just, just briefly.",281,,
1106,0.97,7398.157,7408.1,"You know, I built a great relationship with the chief information security officer for the city of Seattle, Seattle it in my position.",281,,
1107,0.97,7408.1,7410.77,Supervising the technology team.,281,,
1108,0.97,7410.77,7416.041,"Back in 2019, he moved on to create a Cybersecurity firm.",281,,
1109,0.97,7416.041,7433.759,"We stayed in touch and as Megumi mentioned we invested, the Department did, to perform an audit of ourselves and we worked with Seattle it to understand how to Prioritize and implement and mitigate the risks that were discovered in the audit.",281,,
1110,0.97,7433.759,7441.6,"Then in 2019, the security team began introducing an auditing process to the customer Department.",281,,
1111,0.97,7441.6,7444.003,We fully participated that in 2019.,281,,
1112,0.97,7444.003,7446.739,That will be a Bi-Annual process.,281,,
1113,0.97,7446.739,7452.278,"Again, 2021 we will participate in another audit.",281,,
1114,0.97,7452.278,7468.06,"My team is trained on modern security methods and tactics and Yeah, we just take security and privacy seriously as a department.",281,,
1115,0.97,7468.06,7470.563,"The next question, you already asked my follow up question.",282,,
1116,0.97,7470.563,7472.665,Thank you for your time and your work.,282,,
1117,0.97,7472.665,7473.365,Thank you.,283,,
1118,0.97,7473.365,7473.866,Thank you.,284,,
1119,0.97,7473.866,7477.169,Thank you.,285,,
1120,0.97,7477.169,7480.306,Lovely to see you.,286,,
1121,0.97,7480.306,7484.21,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,287,,
1122,0.97,7484.21,7490.816,"Councilmembers, again, the auditor will be auditor's office in the legislative branch at our disposal for questions and follow up.",287,,
1123,0.97,7490.816,7497.056,We are glad to hear auditor Jones and his team will be following up on this.,287,,
1124,0.97,7497.056,7500.092,"And, it is good to hear directly from Sdot.",287,,
1125,0.97,7500.092,7505.831,Thank you for being available to answer questions and supply all of the contacts for us.,287,,
1126,0.97,7505.831,7512.972,We will continue to ask questions about the new technologies and reviewing the official surveillance reports as well.,287,,
1127,0.97,7512.972,7520.045,And getting back to you with any concerns that we hear from the public about these.,287,,
1128,0.97,7520.045,7533.592,We know that some of the technology we are really looking forward to like the block and the box technology and of course safety around schools and providing that access to the lower West Seattle bridge.,287,,
1129,0.97,7533.592,7554.38,"At the same time, you know, there are concerns about, you know, protecting the data, the personal identifiable information and so we are going to continue to balance that, work with our auditor, too, and with information technology and in this case, Sdot.",287,,
1130,0.97,7554.38,7557.449,Councilmembers any final questions?,287,,
1131,0.97,7557.449,7557.85,Okay.,288,,
1132,0.97,7557.85,7558.45,"Oh, council member Herbold.",288,,
1133,0.97,7558.45,7559.251,I am sorry.,289,,
1134,0.97,7559.251,7563.088,Very short questions that were left on my list.,289,,
1135,0.97,7563.088,7581.507,I just wanted to--I understand that the raw data is shared with Wsdot I just want to hear that it is not--I know Sdot does not use it for enforcement but it is not shared with SPD is that correct?,289,,
1136,0.97,7581.507,7583.909,It is not shared.,290,,
1137,0.97,7583.909,7586.578,It is not shared.,290,,
1138,0.97,7586.578,7586.812,Yes.,291,,
1139,0.97,7586.812,7598.324,"We asked that question directly to Wsdot, Megumi and they said we do not share it with anyone.",291,,
1140,0.97,7598.324,7612.538,"And then Lastly, I understand that Wsdot temporarily holds the raw data for Seven-Days does Sdot as well?",292,,
1141,0.97,7612.538,7619.778,No.,293,,
1142,0.97,7619.778,7620.112,We don't.,294,,
1143,0.97,7620.112,7628.587,"And Wsdot takes the raw plate information and immediately Randomizes it, assigns it a value that you cannot reverse back to the original plate information?",295,,
1144,0.97,7628.587,7633.959,They do hold that for seven- days for trouble shooting purposes.,295,,
1145,0.97,7633.959,7641.2,"So, again, the raw data is never held by Sdot.",295,,
1146,0.97,7641.2,7643.402,Thank you.,296,,
1147,0.97,7643.402,7645.137,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",297,,
1148,0.97,7645.137,7653.345,And final questions before we end this agenda item and sign off?,298,,
1149,0.97,7653.345,7654.98,Thank you for being here today.,299,,
1150,0.97,7654.98,7664.189,That was our last item on the agenda.,299,,
1151,0.97,7664.189,7666.892,It concludes the January 20 21 meeting.,299,,
1152,0.97,7666.892,7668.894,Thank you for attending and we are adjourned.,299,,
