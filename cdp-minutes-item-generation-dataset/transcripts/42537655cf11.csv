30,0.97,263.129,264.097,"Thank you, Council members.",14,,
31,0.97,264.097,266.399,"Starting in the budget and revenue space, two major updates.",14,,
32,0.97,266.399,285.184,"The first is House bill 1368, which is the early action Covid relief package now getting Federal funding through state programs and that passed the Senate last week, 47-2 and is going to the governor's desk, meaning it will go to the executive agencies and then additional details will be worked out to local organizations.",14,,
33,0.97,285.184,297.797,We will be working closely with partners at the state to make sure funding is used it to its highest and best use and try to secure funding for hour public health response.,14,,
34,0.97,297.797,334.567,The other item I would highlight in the above it revenue space is Senate bill 5096 and this is the Senate--currently it is of the governor's version of the capital gains tax and it is scheduled for a vote out of committee later today and I anticipate that we may see some changes offered by the Senate to make it more in line with what they are thinking about capital gains.,14,,
35,0.97,334.567,337.97,"Those are not currently available but when we return next week, I'm happy to provide an update.",14,,
36,0.97,337.97,343.476,I will pause there for any questions about revenue.,14,,
37,0.97,343.476,354.854,We will talk about the budget and or revenue section.,15,,
38,0.97,354.854,356.289,"Thank you very much, Madam President.",16,,
39,0.97,356.289,357.09,Thank you for the update.,16,,
40,0.97,357.09,358.958,I am excited to hear about the Senate.,16,,
41,0.97,358.958,378.611,We are working on this for a number of years and we appreciate those in the house who continue to pass it over and that people in the Senate who are fighting for it.,16,,
42,0.97,378.611,381.114,We are excited to see what is happening around that bill today.,16,,
43,0.97,381.114,381.914,Please keep us updated.,16,,
44,0.97,381.914,388.988,Can you talk about whether we are in support of representative Harris and their house bill 1494?,16,,
45,0.97,388.988,398.131,I would have to check and get back to you.,17,,
46,0.97,398.131,399.332,I am not sure about that bill.,17,,
47,0.97,399.332,399.932,"Okay, great.",18,,
48,0.97,399.932,419.051,"We are talking about more progressive taxes, especially on the wealthiest and largest companies, and I believe this effort by representative Harris is a way to offset taxes that have been more progressive in nature and trying to find that balance.",18,,
49,0.97,419.051,427.16,"I want to send a note of support if that bill continues to move forward and if there are new pieces of legislation, because it could take many years.",18,,
50,0.97,427.16,433.666,I want to note my appreciation.,18,,
51,0.97,433.666,435.101,"Absolutely, I looked at the bill.",19,,
52,0.97,435.101,443.242,"We might get it into the housing space but if not, I will follow-up with you and your office.",19,,
53,0.97,443.242,453.085,Any other questions for Lynn?,20,,
54,0.97,453.085,460.493,We have a quick Scan.,21,,
55,0.97,460.493,472.205,"Sorry, because of the way the presentation is, it looks like there is another question.",21,,
56,0.97,472.205,488.588,Anything on how much additional support the city of Seattle can expect with the early relief package that is passing the chambers?,22,,
57,0.97,488.588,490.523,"Unfortunately, we do not have that information yet.",23,,
58,0.97,490.523,491.591,I know it is of concern.,23,,
59,0.97,491.591,500.199,The legislation itself provides very little detail about how the money will be allocated and leaves a lot of flexibility to the executive agencies.,23,,
60,0.97,500.199,535.268,"Some of those agencies in particular like the Department of health, are receiving the money for the response and we understand that is likely, at least some good portion of that, is likely to come through local public health agencies and we want to work closely with public health on that, but I think we are getting details about how other funding will be allocated but as we learn more, I am happy to provide more information to your office.",23,,
61,0.97,535.268,570.803,"Councilmember, the one thing we do know is that they will receive $23 million directly in mental assistance that is not coming as a result of this bill but that is a direct allocation and then other housing money is similar--we do not know how that will flow but it will very likely be very similar to what happened with the last funding, where the money will go directly to the county but I do know city staff are actively engaged in conversations with the county.",24,,
62,0.97,570.803,576.275,"Okay, thank you for that.",25,,
63,0.97,576.275,577.51,I see your hand is up.,25,,
64,0.97,577.51,581.514,"Thank you, just one question.",26,,
65,0.97,581.514,610.843,"On the bill--I can't remember which one it is, but to make the progressive--sorry, the property tax revenue more progressive compared to now, it does not fall on Renters but it is not progressive on the middle-class owners, who are basically paying the same grade.",26,,
66,0.97,610.843,615.081,"To make it progressive, am I right it would require a constitutional change or am I wrong about that?",26,,
67,0.97,615.081,616.115,"Yes, that is correct.",27,,
68,0.97,616.115,616.515,It would.,27,,
69,0.97,616.515,628.661,There is a companion resolution that goes along with the bill by 4094 by representative Harris.,27,,
70,0.97,628.661,629.895,I missed that already.,28,,
71,0.97,629.895,631.764,"Again, I am sorry if you already said this.",28,,
72,0.97,631.764,632.531,I was distracted.,28,,
73,0.97,632.531,653.786,"What is your sense of how likely it is--this would be a hugely welcomed shift but this is something that we have wanted for years but has not changed and now Democrats have a majority in both houses, so do you see this going somewhere?",28,,
74,0.97,653.786,659.792,I am not sure exactly what the odds are of it passing.,29,,
75,0.97,659.792,664.597,It is still alive.,29,,
76,0.97,664.597,694.894,"The fiscal cutoff is not until next Monday, so there is some chance it could pass out of committee, but I am not sure exactly what the prospects are, as you have said--it is a significant change and quite a heavy lift.",29,,
77,0.97,694.894,695.928,"Okay, thank you so much.",30,,
78,0.97,695.928,699.432,"I do not see any other hands raised, so let's move to the next section, thank you.",30,,
79,0.97,699.432,705.638,I will go to Hannah.,31,,
80,0.97,705.638,709.675,"Thank you, a few updates in the education space, where a lot of our priorities are moving through.",32,,
81,0.97,709.675,713.546,The first is bill 1215 for kids.,32,,
82,0.97,713.546,723.756,The House and the Senate version will have hearings today and those will continue to move forward.,32,,
83,0.97,723.756,729.628,The Senate scaled-back from their introductions.,32,,
84,0.97,729.628,761.694,"The child care licensing bill had a hearing last week and is scheduled for executive action today and another bill to highlight is Senate bill 5340 about qualifications and that expands eligibility criteria for school board directors, allowing Nonpermanent residents to apply.",32,,
85,0.97,761.694,764.163,That was taken on last week and that has been passed.,32,,
86,0.97,764.163,766.799,I will pause for any questions.,32,,
87,0.97,766.799,771.37,Any questions related to education?,33,,
88,0.97,771.37,776.876,"I am not seeing any, so we can keep going.",33,,
89,0.97,776.876,778.444,Moving on to the environmental space.,34,,
90,0.97,778.444,826.525,"I would NOTE as an update, since we have passed policy cutoff, that all of the bills we have been tracking here as priorities for support are on track, have passed the policy committee and are track to move forward out of fiscal committee with hearings and Committee scheduled in the respective fiscal committees this week, including 1075 on transportation and 10 84 on building, and 1091, which is the fuel standard, and Senate bill 1522 which deals with recycling and stewardship and 5141, which is the heel act.",34,,
91,0.97,826.525,854.553,"The one still in policy committee is the commitment act, which is the governor request legislation combined with the restoration of authority for Pollutions and while this did not make it past--did not make it out of committee after the policy cutoff, it is going to be considered--it is exempt from the cutoffs.",34,,
92,0.97,854.553,870.035,We know that the current sponsors are working very diligently to incorporate feedback that they have received in public comments subsequently and we expect he will have a substituted version of the bill in the coming weeks for consideration.,34,,
93,0.97,870.035,876.508,I will pause for any questions on the environment.,34,,
94,0.97,876.508,877.743,Any questions on the environment?,35,,
95,0.97,877.743,881.78,I am not seeing any hands raised.,35,,
96,0.97,881.78,885.117,Moving on to general government with a couple quick highlights.,36,,
97,0.97,885.117,902.701,"House bill 1095, which is considered to be an early action economic recovery response has passed both chambers and has been sent to the governor's desk.",36,,
98,0.97,902.701,917.316,"This will talk about grants given for the purposes of economic stabilization and recovery, exempt from state taxes, meaning the grants funding can go a little further, so that is going to the governor's desk.",36,,
99,0.97,917.316,918.951,Expect it to be signed.,36,,
100,0.97,918.951,923.122,"Another House bill, which is the armory PDA, is scheduled for a vote in the budget committee.",36,,
101,0.97,923.122,933.065,This is the second time it is going through the fiscal committee and is scheduled for a vote tomorrow.,36,,
102,0.97,933.065,951.884,"And then highlighting one bill that was a problematic bill we were tracking, which did not make it out of the committee, so it will preempt the city in a variety of ways on telecommunications.",36,,
103,0.97,951.884,957.79,It is Senate bill 5110 and that is not passed out and it will not be considered for the session.,36,,
104,0.97,957.79,959.491,I will pause for any questions about general government.,36,,
105,0.97,959.491,964.563,Any questions about general government?,37,,
106,0.97,964.563,967.466,I have a couple of questions.,37,,
107,0.97,967.466,974.606,"One, related to this public meetings and emergencies bill.",37,,
108,0.97,974.606,981.513,It looks like that was sponsored by the President- elect.,37,,
109,0.97,981.513,1007.539,"I want to get an understanding where you think that is in the process, in the legislative process, and then the second question I had was SHB 1423, which is the social equity bill on the Cannabis industry.",37,,
110,0.97,1007.539,1010.275,I want to get a better understanding on what that bill accomplishes.,37,,
111,0.97,1010.275,1027.426,"I know I have been receiving a lot of Emails from constituents about social equity issues in the Cannabis industry and want to get a better understanding of what this bill, which is in order to know whether this would address some of the concerns I have been hearing from constituents in my Inbox.",37,,
112,0.97,1027.426,1033.465,"Those two questions, please.",37,,
113,0.97,1033.465,1047.312,House bill 1056 is pretty far ahead of what we would consider that general schedule of legislation and has passed the house and received a hearing in the Senate committee.,38,,
114,0.97,1047.312,1055.454,"It does not look like it is scheduled for a committee vote yet but that is not unusual given how far ahead it is, dealing with Senate bills at this point.",38,,
115,0.97,1055.454,1062.361,It has been moving at a pretty good clip.,38,,
116,0.97,1062.361,1084.349,"By way of background, this would provide for any future declarations of public emergency that the provisions will be open to public meetings, which were implemented by the governor order and subsequently extended through the duration earlier in session.",38,,
117,0.97,1084.349,1089.788,"This would make sure they apply to any future public emergencies, so it is good for not just the current crisis we are in but future crises.",38,,
118,0.97,1089.788,1109.842,I would anticipate that bill--it is in a good place and I have not had any indication it is facing any problems in the Senate other than it just being so far ahead it needs to catch up to everything else.,38,,
119,0.97,1109.842,1133.031,"On House bill 1443, this is one we ran this report--it was as late as we could to catch all the updates as it is passing out of committee but there were a few between the legislative system, that it did not get updated and this one actually did pass out of the policy Committee, so it is in appropriations right now.",38,,
120,0.97,1133.031,1148.881,"I can provide a brief update and provide more information to you but in general, this would make some changes to the social equity and Cannabis task force.",38,,
121,0.97,1148.881,1152.151,"I would have to double check the exact framing, but they work on these issues.",38,,
122,0.97,1152.151,1171.503,They would make changes to the membership as well as provide for a grant program to be managed by the Department of Commerce to provide social equity grants for the Cannabis industry to help address some of the concerns I know you and your office and other Councilmembers have.,38,,
123,0.97,1171.503,1187.886,"I do not know if it addresses all of the issues, of which there are many, but I think it is a small step forward and I am happy to provide a more competent update to you and your office.",38,,
124,0.97,1187.886,1204.136,"And then reviewing the Bulletin, sorry, I have one more question and I think it is on if you Scroll down, Hannah, to page 6 because my computer is acting up, tax increment financing, 5211.",39,,
125,0.97,1204.136,1218.15,Can you quickly tell us what the intent of this particular bill is and where we are at on it in terms of process?,39,,
126,0.97,1218.15,1229.161,"Certainly, this bill would authorize tax increment financing.",40,,
127,0.97,1229.161,1233.365,I do not have the specifics of what the program would look like but I am happy to follow up on that.,40,,
128,0.97,1233.365,1236.034,This is the issue Awc has been working on for many years.,40,,
129,0.97,1236.034,1242.941,They are trying to provide some additional revenue options through tax increment financing for local governments.,40,,
130,0.97,1242.941,1261.093,"It is currently in--it has a committee vote scheduled tomorrow, and so I anticipate it will continue to move forward.",40,,
131,0.97,1261.093,1266.298,"In terms of overall prospects, I do not have a good sense of that but I am happy to do some Diggng and get back to you.",40,,
132,0.97,1266.298,1277.909,"I would like to get a better understanding of what problems this is designed to fix, to get a better understanding of the legislation side.",41,,
133,0.97,1277.909,1280.312,"Councilmember, please.",41,,
134,0.97,1280.312,1322.02,"I will say this bill has been supported, the idea of this tool is something that the economic development district has been talking for some time and as was said before, I know the Association has supported it in different development entities and they supported the idea that it would generate revenue based on future value, that could be assessed so there is some additional revenue available for community development projects.",42,,
135,0.97,1322.02,1338.97,"There is some concern it could be used--if something like this passes, it needs to be used in an equitable way.",42,,
136,0.97,1338.97,1349.648,"In the South end of Seattle, there is some concern but in general, I think it is something folks are interested in as another tool for supporting economic development.",42,,
137,0.97,1349.648,1355.887,Thank you for that.,43,,
138,0.97,1355.887,1357.089,That is what I was hoping.,43,,
139,0.97,1357.089,1365.097,"I was hoping to get a better understanding of how this would be utilized, so I appreciate that additional context.",43,,
140,0.97,1365.097,1365.997,That is very helpful.,43,,
141,0.97,1365.997,1368.9,"I do not see any other hands raised, so I think you can keep going.",43,,
142,0.97,1368.9,1371.103,I will hand it off to Hana to cover Healthcare.,44,,
143,0.97,1371.103,1375.374,A couple of dates about some bills that will move through.,45,,
144,0.97,1375.374,1394.893,"House bill 1477, which is the reintroduced version of the system and creating high-tech crisis call centers and response teams, which was heard last week and is scheduled for executive action today.",45,,
145,0.97,1394.893,1403.802,There is ongoing work with Stakeholders to address some of the concerns over implementation and costs and that bill continues to move forward.,45,,
146,0.97,1403.802,1419.451,"And then the Medicaid bill, we followed so closely and are continuing to support this year, had a hearing yesterday and is scheduled for executive action tomorrow.",45,,
147,0.97,1419.451,1441.406,"Health bill 5195, the Opioid Overdose of medication bill, is scheduled for a hearing later this week, and House bill 5313 will move forward.",45,,
148,0.97,1441.64,1444.142,"That is about unfair practice, to deny coverage for gender reaffirming treatments.",45,,
149,0.97,1444.142,1467.098,"That is scheduled for a hearing at the end of the week, and then there is a bill this week, Senate bill 5399, that establishes a universal Healthcare Commission, that is charged with developing a plan to be a Federal plan for affordable Healthcare coverage, publicly financed for everyone, and that passed out of the policy committee and is set up for a public Committee on Friday.",45,,
150,0.97,1467.098,1472.471,I will pause for questions.,45,,
151,0.97,1472.471,1477.242,Any questions or comments on Healthcare?,46,,
152,0.97,1477.242,1484.082,"I am not seeing any hands raised, so we can keep going.",46,,
153,0.97,1484.082,1487.719,"Hello, thanks everyone.",47,,
154,0.97,1487.719,1494.426,I will just say a few more words about House bill 1494.,47,,
155,0.97,1494.426,1496.027,Representative Harris is talking about tax exemptions.,47,,
156,0.97,1496.027,1517.082,"They would exempt the first 20 $50,000, the owner of the home signed declaration and as we said, it would require a constitutional amendment.",47,,
157,0.97,1517.082,1520.619,I want to make sure everyone understood what that bill was before moving forward with the other housing bills.,47,,
158,0.97,1520.619,1525.457,"There are many other important bills that are still moving, including House bill 1236 with Eviction and 1277 to increase recording fees.",47,,
159,0.97,1525.457,1544.175,"As far as the bills go to address the Eviction moratorium ending at the end of March, Senate bill 5139 would limit rent increases and has Unfortunately died and that bill will not be moving forward Úby Senator Doss.",47,,
160,0.97,1544.175,1557.589,"Senate bill 5160 is there, more critically important since it is the only vehicle at play to address the end of the Eviction moratorium.",47,,
161,0.97,1557.589,1575.574,"It was--executive action was taken last week and was referred to an important hearing today, and the city is supporting it and is scheduled for executive session this upcoming Thursday.",47,,
162,0.97,1575.574,1579.411,"That is all I have on housing bills for this week, if there are any questions.",47,,
163,0.97,1579.411,1584.382,Any questions?,48,,
164,0.97,1584.382,1586.618,"I am not seeing any hands raised, so we can keep going.",48,,
165,0.97,1586.618,1601.633,"As far as police reform, this is another area of great importance that the legislator mentioned and there are many bills that are still in play and two bills passed the House last week that we have not really talked about since the first week.",49,,
166,0.97,1601.633,1625.49,"House bill 1088, which looks at officer impeachment disclosures, creates best practices and Online Trainings and makes a law enforcement require about past impeachment disclosure before hiring an officer, and it passed the House last week on a bipartisan vote of 61-37.",49,,
167,0.97,1625.49,1658.089,"Similarly, House bill 1089 sponsored by this representative would provide transparency regarded investigations and more about deadly force . This authorizes the state auditor to actually review deadly force investigations to determine whether the law enforcement agencies complied with all actual rules and procedures.",49,,
168,0.97,1658.089,1696.294,"House bill 1203 deals with community oversight, executive action was taken in the public safety committee and we are working with the prime sponsor of the bill, representative Johnson, and office of police accountability, to ensure it is compatible with our police oversight system in Seattle and that bill has a hearing and appropriations tomorrow, and House bill 1267, the governor's independent investigation legislation is in the Appropriations Committee but has not had a hearing yet scheduled.",49,,
169,0.97,1696.294,1710.141,House bill 1310 by representative Johnson and the use of force also had executive action taken last week to move forward to the Appropriations Committee but there is not been a hearing scheduled yet.,49,,
170,0.97,1710.141,1729.461,"One thing that does appear to have falling prey to the cut off is House bill 1507, that I mentioned last week about independent prosecutions.",49,,
171,0.97,1729.461,1732.063,"It was heard very late and introduced very late in the process, heard yesterday.",49,,
172,0.97,1732.063,1733.264,Executive action was not taken.,49,,
173,0.97,1733.264,1754.452,"We will keep an eye out to see if any of those provisions are likely to get amended to other bills or it might be something to work on in the interim, given the other independent investigations still moving forward.",49,,
174,0.97,1754.452,1777.408,"And then Finally, over in the Senate, the decertification bill, Senate bill 5051, had executive action taken yesterday and was amended with mostly technical amendments, one that changes the Cjtc to include an officer as part of the process in the executive session.",49,,
175,0.97,1777.408,1779.01,Now it will move onto the Senate.,49,,
176,0.97,1779.01,1781.646,"That is all I have for police reform, although that was quite a lot.",49,,
177,0.97,1781.646,1783.214,That is always a lot.,50,,
178,0.97,1783.214,1785.116,Any comments or questions?,50,,
179,0.97,1785.116,1797.228,"Thank you, Council President, for the update.",51,,
180,0.97,1797.228,1799.664,"I had a question about Senate bill 5134, Senator Solomon's bill.",51,,
181,0.97,1799.664,1800.732,Did you touch up on that?,51,,
182,0.97,1800.732,1806.604,"That is one of the strongest police reform bills that we have, especially in regards to arbitration.",51,,
183,0.97,1806.604,1807.205,"Yes, Peterson.",52,,
184,0.97,1807.205,1815.947,I do think that is also a bill that has fallen prey to cut off.,52,,
185,0.97,1815.947,1819.417,"Next week, we will also make sure we indicate--we do not have time.",52,,
186,0.97,1819.417,1827.125,"It takes a while for the system to update, so some things that we have not adequately marked, we will do that going forward.",52,,
187,0.97,1827.125,1846.778,"As you know, elimination of arbitration completely was an extremely controversial issue, that drew significant opposition on a number of fronts, so this did not make it out of the labor committee.",52,,
188,0.97,1846.778,1866.231,"We do continue to have conversations with legislators, as said, to highlight the importance of police disciplinary process performed and we continue to have conversations with legislators to try to move something forward this session.",52,,
189,0.97,1866.231,1872.403,We will keep you posted on those efforts and enlist your support because it is definitely quite a steep hill to climb.,52,,
190,0.97,1872.403,1875.673,Thank you to everyone that has been supporting those efforts thus far.,52,,
191,0.97,1875.673,1876.941,"Go ahead, Councilmember.",53,,
192,0.97,1876.941,1889.32,You said it was creating controversy on a number of fronts.,54,,
193,0.97,1889.32,1898.429,"Could you specify who was opposing that, to remove arbitration?",54,,
194,0.97,1898.429,1921.152,I will--I think it was clear at the public hearing on that bill but there were some labor unions that represent police officers that expressed their concern about not having arbitration as a way to move forward.,55,,
195,0.97,1921.152,1923.121,I do not know if you want to add anything.,55,,
196,0.97,1923.121,1924.722,I think you covered it perfectly.,56,,
197,0.97,1924.722,1952.05,"I want to note for Council members, there are strong Oppositions to this theoretical threat to labor unions existence and changing any of the statutes because of this kind of existential fear about that, given that labor unions have experienced attacks across this country, locally like the freedom foundation.",56,,
198,0.97,1952.05,1953.751,There is quite a high level of concern.,56,,
199,0.97,1953.751,1991.022,"The work we have to do in front of us is to really illustrate the counsel's work and the Mayor's priorities are in line with working families, while squarely addressing police reform and I think we are getting close to identifying some options that we are hopeful all parties can't agree with and it is hard to move anything without consensus . It is challenging through virtual sessions that we are doing work with the impacted unions that do represent police unions and corrections groups and Whatnot but have expressed concerns.",56,,
200,0.97,1991.022,1999.43,We can follow up with more specificity that is helpful but we have a bit of work to do and we will be calling on you and your colleagues as we move forward.,56,,
201,0.97,1999.43,2014.412,I would love to get some follow-up . I think it is disturbing that police unions are saying they do not want something about police reform.,57,,
202,0.97,2014.412,2016.848,I do not think the state Egislatures should be listening to that.,57,,
203,0.97,2016.848,2019.65,I will follow-up with you afterwards.,57,,
204,0.97,2019.65,2020.318,"Okay, Councilmember?",58,,
205,0.97,2020.318,2027.458,I have a question about 5134.,59,,
206,0.97,2027.458,2039.737,"I understand that given the outright ban on arbitration in that bill, why there has been some crunch.",59,,
207,0.97,2039.737,2053.851,I do not understand why everything else in that bill is going to basically languish because of the controversy around arbitration.,59,,
208,0.97,2053.851,2107.438,"Again, for the record, Senate bill 5134 allowed for outright elimination of arbitration, and Senate bill 5055 makes some changes to arbitration but we learned last week that the title was changed to Senate bill 5055 to limit the ability to make amendments to that bill, and then the city of Seattle--I am very disturbed about that development as well but back to 5134, there is a lot in that bill that is not about arbitration, and I am wondering if anything has been identified as priorities to try to move into another vehicle.",59,,
209,0.97,2107.438,2115.146,That bill prohibits collective bargaining agreements from requiring things like waving.,59,,
210,0.97,2115.146,2134.165,For misconduct interviews and collective bargaining agreements and time limits on complaint filing or limits on use of civilian supervisors and investigators and use of subpoena authority.,59,,
211,0.97,2134.165,2142.373,These are all very important issues to the city of Seattle and I am concerned there is no vehicle moving forward that addresses any of Seattle's police accountability issues.,59,,
212,0.97,2142.373,2143.374,"Thank you, council member.",60,,
213,0.97,2143.374,2180.711,"I will say I think many of the provisions in that bill, in addition to arbitration, were seen as quite controversial changes, just controversial Úchanges over all to policing and police reform, and as I said, with Councilmember Peterson, we continue to look for avenues to see if any changes can be made this session, Additionally.",60,,
214,0.97,2180.711,2188.085,"I am happy to follow up with Senator Solomon, who is the cosponsor of that bill, to see if he has identified any means without that bill may move forward.",60,,
215,0.97,2188.085,2189.687,"If you could, I would really appreciate that.",61,,
216,0.97,2189.687,2205.536,"Please inquire on my path, because I am a big supporter of that bill and a fan of his work.",61,,
217,0.97,2205.536,2206.037,Councilmember?,62,,
218,0.97,2206.037,2383.414,"Thank you, just on the point, many of us responded about policing and also about the question of arbitration and the connection between arbitration and police accountability, I want to note that it is quite disturbing, and this is not the first time we have heard this from police unions, and on a regular basis, this false equivalency between Left-Wing and Progressive movements, peaceful movements like black lives matter for example, and all kinds of weapons during the black lives matter movements compared to the attempt by hundreds of Far- right Trump's supporters violently attacking the Capitol and in an actual bed to try to overturn a Democratic election result but it just struck me that for them to compare the question, the urgently needed police accountability, and the fact of the police unions like the police officers Guild, being one of the key obstacles to achieving police Úaccountability is a Fax, not a opinion, and this is right wing conservative policy kind of organization that has a long track record of attacking unions rights, and it is of false equivalency, and I think the rank and file of the counsel, last summer, during the protest, they made it a very important point when the delegates voted in a majority to expand the police officer counsel by explaining we think all workers have the right to Unionize and demand workplace conditions and advocate for their wages under workplace questions but that cannot be in any way in opposition to the fact the Union has to stand against racism, against violence on the working class, and injuries to all.",63,,
219,0.97,2383.414,2410.508,"They need to reject any kind of false equivalency between the fight to Unionize and the fight for workers rights and compare that to the right of workers demanding police accountability, especially in light of the systemic racism in the country.",63,,
220,0.97,2410.508,2413.144,"Thank you, if I can just respond, you made a good point.",64,,
221,0.97,2413.144,2420.251,I did not intend to make a comparison between what we are seeking as the city with our partner around arbitration all reform and the foundation.,64,,
222,0.97,2420.251,2465.629,"I just want you to have the information as a counsel that the concerns of the labor community has expressed has less to do--I think there is a lot of goodwill, and a lot of commitment to racial justice in police reform, but it is one of those delicate negotiations at this point where we are trying to be respectful of the fact labor unions have, for many years, felt under attack by those kinds of groups and they want to make sure as we pursue reform, that we are not doing harm to those folks and those institutions that protect workers.",64,,
223,0.97,2465.629,2513.444,"Clearly, that is not the intent but given some of the complex policy issues that play here, that is why we have continued to have that conversation and we will but to keep you and your counsel colleagues engaged in that because I feel like we are making headway with our partners and they care deeply about racial justice in police reform and they had the experience in very recent history of being attacked from all angles, so we are trying to thread that needle appropriately and we are in negotiations around how we can move forward.",64,,
224,0.97,2513.444,2518.749,I think this is a challenging one but we are committed to this and understand this is very high on the counsel's agenda as a whole.,64,,
225,0.97,2518.749,2529.86,"I want to clarify--as Progressives together, we are United.",65,,
226,0.97,2529.86,2628.258,"I am just saying they do draw that false equivalency and it is happening more and more given the atmosphere of not just in D.C. but nationwide and I also would say as a Rank-And- file Union member myself, and someone that is a dedicated fighter for civil rights, we should not--there are conservative elements and there are tremendous members of Rank- And-File who really have spoken up about black lives matter and about the fight against racism and also made it clear that the fight against specific oppression has to go hand in hand with the fight against, for example, the backlash that especially public's opinions have faced, rightly from certain groups, but primarily from big businesses and the idea of politics that has for decades--we have to take this on in a big way's stance about unions and workers as a whole but make it very clear that we say those attacks go Hand-In- hand with the fight against racism and oppression.",65,,
227,0.97,2628.258,2629.893,"Okay, thank you for that conversation.",66,,
228,0.97,2629.893,2723.12,"I just wanted to provide a little bit of additional information and clarity that a think is getting missed or Overseen which is my understanding based on my own conversations with this statewide coalition that is working on this police accountability reform efforts, it is not just labor unions that represent collection officers or police officers that are involved in engagement and there is a Washington coalition for police accountability and organizations that focus on centering families that have lost family members to these amendments in the past and that coalition also includes members of folks who were involved in the initiative 940, the Washington campaign, and civil rights organizations, tribes, labor unions, members of the faith community and activists who are working together in concert to try to thread the needle on these issues to see some progress in the state legislator as it relates to many of the bills that are included in this Bulletin, that th city of Seattle is continuing to support.",66,,
229,0.97,2723.12,2776.707,"Those bills are listed publicly on their Website in terms of the one they are actively supporting, and encouraging community members to also support, so my understanding is this particular bill, Senate bill 5134 is not one of the bills included in their legislative agenda, so I want to be cognizant to the fact that there are a lot of folks advocating for differing strategies at the state Legislature, including the Washington coalition for police accountability, who is not made up of just police unions or unions at represent Correctional officers.",66,,
230,0.97,2776.707,2816.947,"That is another helpful piece of information, hopefully, that I think shows that things are complicated and there are many Stakeholders engaging on this issue and how her goal is to make sure from my perspective is we--that we continue to support many of those initiatives and continue to advocate for the strongest version of accountability measures that will make a difference for our accountability system and we will keep working together to try to accomplish that goal.",66,,
231,0.97,2816.947,2823.353,"Okay, I do not see any other hands up in this space, so why don't we go ahead and keep going.",66,,
232,0.97,2823.353,2833.964,A few quick things on the public safety front.,67,,
233,0.97,2833.964,2873.203,"These bills are still moving, House bill 1283, House bill 5038, and also another incorrect item on here, right at the end of the page before you have the civil protection orders, substitute House bill 1230, which would streamline the civil protection order system and that bill is still moving and has been referred to appropriations and then, the last bill and page I think on the next page, some of you are interested in Senate bill 5226.",67,,
234,0.97,2873.203,2907.137,"That bill was substantially admitted and I would would require a person who will attest to an infraction that they do not have the ability to pay and be informed how to submit evidence of their inability to pay and also information that if they do not pay, they may be subject to a collection action, including the Garnishment of wages, and also requires the court to attend to enter a payment plan with pursing those who cannot pay.",67,,
235,0.97,2907.137,2911.008,Provisions were streamlined but that bill is moving forward.,67,,
236,0.97,2911.008,2914.911,That is all I have on public safety.,67,,
237,0.97,2914.911,2917.714,"All right, any questions on that?",68,,
238,0.97,2917.714,2926.423,Let's keep going.,68,,
239,0.97,2926.423,2931.128,I have a few bills to highlight with the safety net.,69,,
240,0.97,2931.128,2944.675,"House bill 1151 about economic recovery, which is one of the big priority bills for human service advocates, they want to move out of appropriations and is now going to rules.",69,,
241,0.97,2944.675,2975.472,"We are looking at that tax credit and Lastly, Senate bill 5214, which Reinvests--it was amended so we make sure the state's unemployment rate is at 7% and does that count towards the total limit of 16th months in that program.",69,,
242,0.97,2975.472,2981.345,"That is retroactive through last year, so it covers the pandemic.",69,,
243,0.97,2981.345,2984.114,And that bill is scheduled for a public hearing today.,69,,
244,0.97,2984.114,2989.186,That is all I have on the safety net.,69,,
245,0.97,2989.186,2995.492,Any questions?,70,,
246,0.97,2995.492,3000.797,"I am not seeing any questions, so we can keep going.",70,,
247,0.97,3000.797,3006.837,"Now, with transportation, we have some brief updates because we are low on time.",71,,
248,0.97,3006.837,3008.505,We are discussing the environment and a small update.,71,,
249,0.97,3008.505,3024.588,"There was a motion that this would not go to transportation in an effort to expedite and support that legislation, it does appear it has been referred after going through environment appropriations to the transportation committee.",71,,
250,0.97,3024.588,3057.054,"On the House side, we anticipate it will pass again and I think it remains to be seen what will happen in the Senate and is something we are tracking closely, then they have passed out of the local government committee and it was amended to make some changes to the excise tax piece, but I will not go into all the details.",71,,
251,0.97,3057.054,3059.089,"If anyone is interested, I would be happy to follow up.",71,,
252,0.97,3059.089,3060.457,Any questions about transportation?,72,,
253,0.97,3060.457,3063.093,"All right, seeing nine.",72,,
254,0.97,3063.093,3067.597,Let's keep going.,72,,
255,0.97,3067.597,3068.865,That concludes our presentation.,73,,
256,0.97,3068.865,3069.399,"Excellent, okay.",74,,
257,0.97,3069.399,3077.574,Any other comments about that before we shift gears into the next session?,74,,
258,0.97,3077.574,3079.609,I am hearing none.,74,,
259,0.97,3079.609,3085.315,I want to thank all of you for your good work on all of these issues.,74,,

267,0.97,3148.044,3149.312,There are two items on the agenda.,76,,
268,0.97,3149.312,3158.121,The first is an agreement through Metro and an integrated resource plan and progress report.,76,,
269,0.97,3158.121,3174.804,"I'm happy to answer questions about those . In district 4, this past Friday, I held my weekly office hours by telephone.",76,,
270,0.97,3174.804,3177.774,"Constituents were talking about homelessness, public safety, and the status of the police contract.",76,,
271,0.97,3177.774,3192.122,"We have some good news about the U.S. District Court, where they postponed the sale of the National Archives facility.",76,,
272,0.97,3192.122,3193.123,They created a permanent injunction.,76,,
273,0.97,3193.123,3194.124,That is located in district 4.,76,,
274,0.97,3194.124,3200.23,I am hopeful that the new Biden demonstration will agree that the trumpet administration did not follow the law and it is best to keep the historical documents here.,76,,
275,0.97,3200.23,3229.059,"We already support keeping the facility in the Northwest and Ideally they can find Federal resources to pay for any necessary upgrades to the facility and I greatly appreciate the work of our Attorney General about Ferguson and the tribal nations advocacy organizations . They have researchers and many others successfully fighting the sale, so we can keep the Archival here for generations to come.",76,,
276,0.97,3229.059,3271.968,"So, during the snowstorm over the weekend, I just want to thank all the city government work crews and their managers for working around the clock, especially those departments we see a lot in our Committee, like the Seattle Department of transportation and public utilities clearing arterial roads and Seattle city light keeping the power on or restoring power where needed, and it is a Testament that Mayor Jenny Durkan and her team are once again very prepared and launched into action during the snowstorm.",76,,
277,0.97,3271.968,3275.472,This is a great example of local government doing basic and good work it was meant to do.,76,,
278,0.97,3275.472,3276.606,I appreciate their hard work.,76,,

284,0.97,3298.995,3315.345,"The next meeting of the committee, which is normally scheduled for February 23 has been rescheduled for March 4, which is the Thursday of the following week and I appreciate committee members working with my office to enable the rescheduling.",78,,
285,0.97,3315.345,3344.774,"The committee is discussing a package of Renters' rights bills and among them, being cosponsored--we discussed the right to representation for Renters facing Eviction and I hope at the next meeting, we will be in a position to vote on the right to that legislation and also discussed the problem of default Evictions.",78,,
286,0.97,3344.774,3364.36,"Renters do not respond to the necessary paperwork and are not able to be present for their Eviction hearing, which happens a great deal because the people who are facing Eviction are facing other types of crises in their life and are being evicted by default and it is a huge issue.",78,,
287,0.97,3364.36,3386.316,"It is the unfortunate outcome of half the Evictions in Seattle, actually, and in addition to those bills, they are working on a companion legislation to the right to counsel legislation to address those default Evictions.",78,,
288,0.97,3386.316,3400.13,The Sustainability of the environment is--the movement want funding.,78,,
289,0.97,3400.13,3414.411,"Once it is done, we will finally be ready to appoint the board including climate activists and organizers and we will fight for investments and green infrastructure in Seattle.",78,,
290,0.97,3414.411,3424.921,"Like that Renters Commission and the human rights Commission, they will have the opportunity to take a courageous stance for communities and I look forward to them doing that.",78,,
291,0.97,3424.921,3430.76,There is one item on today's counsel that I am reporting on.,78,,
292,0.97,3430.76,3441.004,It is the resolution to approve statewide taxes on big business.,78,,
293,0.97,3441.004,3453.349,There is a limitation on the ability to tax the rich.,78,,
294,0.97,3453.349,3460.99,"It was discussed, the last item, there are three progressive bills currently being discussed.",78,,
295,0.97,3460.99,3462.091,One is taxing capital gains.,78,,
296,0.97,3462.091,3478.875,"They are all crucial and need to be passed for raising the funds people need for services, jobs, and other programs.",78,,
297,0.97,3478.875,3507.937,"This resolution States that the city council URGES state lawmakers to pass progressive taxes on the rich and big businesses and raise progressive revenues because we need statewide progressive revenues urgently through other municipalities, to have the right to raise his business taxes.",78,,
298,0.97,3507.937,3519.148,"Every session, lawmakers are looking at progressive bills and it is a question of bringing those progressive measures to the state.",78,,
299,0.97,3519.148,3524.821,It is inexcusable.,78,,
300,0.97,3524.821,3542.272,There are periods when the Democratic party has a full governorship and they are paying lip service to people in the rooms while doing the bidding of big business at the Billionaires.,78,,
301,0.97,3542.272,3550.446,"Working people are facing a compounding crisis during the pandemic and the recession, and they were already in a crisis before the pandemic.",78,,
302,0.97,3550.446,3560.857,The Democrats have the governorship and the need to decisively control the statehouse 57-41 and that state Senate 29-20.,78,,
303,0.97,3560.857,3598.861,"They need to approve taxes on big business and the wealthy to address the suffering of working people and small businesses, which are getting decimated during this pandemic and why at the same time, they are defending the gains by hundreds of rank-and-file members and advocates who have been part of the tax Amazon movement and the George Floyd protests--they want to tax the corporations to get affordable housing and other projects.",78,,
304,0.97,3598.861,3609.305,They urge state lawmakers to pass taxes on big businesses and the rich and to raise progressive revenues.,78,,
305,0.97,3609.305,3638.167,"I want to share that I have sent a public letter of solidarity to the workers who were fighting to build recognition for what has been called a Union that has backed workers and black women workers with Amazon unions, at one of Amazon's warehouse us.",78,,
306,0.97,3638.167,3651.147,"We want to have solidarity for the workers, and to vote a resounding yes for workers' rights.",78,,
307,0.97,3651.147,3689.452,"Amazon will know they have made $22.1 billion in profits and they have been exploiting workers with low wages and we have been talking about their staffing and Sweatshop light conditions including not giving them easy bathroom breaks . over 20,000 Amazon workers are known to have tested positive for Covid with Alabama warehouse reporting one of the highest infection rates.",78,,
308,0.97,3689.452,3703.8,Amazon has skimmed out of its obligations over $61 million in tips from delivery drivers.,78,,
309,0.97,3703.8,3759.155,"And they also state Amazon has no business telling workers not to pay their dues or carry out Antiunion propaganda campaigns which have been relentless, and--Amazon executives are fighting hard and it is selfish prove they are lying and fighting because they know when workers win, they have to begin to respect the demands of their workers and they are afraid of the collective power they will have as a union because they have more power at the boxes and those workers, they will carry out the vote.",78,,
310,0.97,3759.155,3767.997,"Thank you, are there any comments or questions on that report?",79,,
311,0.97,3767.997,3795.124,I just want to reference last week's conversation related to the introduction and I was uncertain of the specificity that was included in the city council's resolution related to our state legislative agenda.,80,,
312,0.97,3795.124,3842.772,"I did not speak up when Councilmember Peterson raised the question about whether or not there is a necessity to pass another piece of legislation given the passage of resolution 31982 in early December, adopted by the Council with a vote of 8-0. I checked the language from that resolution and that resolution States the counsel--they have conference of tax reform that leads to more equitable and Progressive tax structures and decreases reliance on flat tax sources like sales and property taxes.",80,,
313,0.97,3842.772,3857.653,It goes on to say that the city's support to the state Legislature for statewide capital gains tax and a progressive statewide payroll tax does not preempt or diminish the city's local authority.,80,,
314,0.97,3857.653,3899.795,"I agree with the statements of the Council President Gonzalez last week, where he stated there is nothing to prohibit us from passing legislation about items that are on our state legislative agenda if there is new information or the circumstances have changed and from my perspective on the strength of our earlier statement, and the resolution we passed with a vote of 8-0 and the status of the current bill in the state Legislature, I do not see that we would have a need to pass another piece of legislation.",80,,
315,0.97,3899.795,3907.036,"Thank you, Councilmember.",81,,
316,0.97,3907.036,3912.408,I did--I appreciate the Recognitin around the comments I made last week on Monday.,81,,
317,0.97,3912.408,3944.473,"I did want from a procedural perspective may clear that resolutions are often times--, because there is new information or new interest that might not have already adequately been revolved through other pieces of opposition by virtue of making those comments.",81,,
318,0.97,3944.473,3968.064,"I was not trying to put my thumb on a scale one way or another but simply making sure as Council President, I may clear to all of the Council members and members of the UN public what the lay of the land is in terms of the process and the procedure.",81,,
319,0.97,3968.064,4016.545,"I also went back and took a look at that resolution and I had a conversation with members of the office of Intergovernmental relations and it is my understanding that the bills that are currently introduced in the legislation that is being debated at the state Legislature fits squarely within the city's legislative agenda that was adopted by resolution 31982, of which I was the prime sponsor, so, again, the bills that are being discussed right now related to wealth tax, capital gains tax and other progressive revenue taxes streams do not include any language and would not harm the city council's efforts around passage of an implementation of Jumpstart Seattle as proposed by this Councilmember and cosponsored by many of us on this counsel.",81,,
320,0.97,4016.545,4071.567,"I think that the issues that are being highlighted by this new resolution are, as far as I can tell, redundant of the issues that we have already addressed and taken a vote of 8- 0 on, and in our adoption of resolution right here, I am--I agree that I do not think it is necessary for us to adopt a second resolution that effectively REITERATES a position that the city has already taken and that would--that purports to address issues that are not right or under consideration by the state Legislature as I understand it based on my briefing from other people and bills that are being debated in the state Legislature.",81,,
321,0.97,4071.567,4080.876,Either Erin Egan comments or questions?,81,,
322,0.97,4080.876,4087.083,I do not think that the resolution is redundant from a political sense.,82,,
323,0.97,4087.083,4096.525,The agenda includes misinformation . I never denied that.,82,,
324,0.97,4096.525,4140.269,"We talked about that last week but the legislative agenda resolution, if anyone is being honest, there is almost nothing that builds momentum to get these things done and Democrats have been in power before in history, and many Progressive bills have been introduced in the legislatures and many Progressive bills have been introduced, which is a positive thing, and this is urgent that the bills are actually past but simply introduction of those bills by the legislatures does not ensure they will pass.",82,,
325,0.97,4140.269,4189.885,"We have seen this time and time again and if all that is needed was to pass this, then--aggressive taxes have been there for years and this resolution from all of us do that because we intend for the resolution to actually highlight the most crucial issues and to have a specific influence in favor of Progressive taxes and the resolution that the city council members moving forward are also going forward, arguing working people can have an opportunity to tell the city council how they feel about a very crucial issue.",82,,
326,0.97,4189.885,4195.724,The state legislative agenda is many pages long and there are many issues.,82,,
327,0.97,4195.724,4208.938,"Everything we do not do, to bring all kinds of issues, they are the most crucial, and the most at stake.",82,,
328,0.97,4208.938,4215.044,"In that sense, I would say the resolution is important and would vote yes on it.",82,,
329,0.97,4215.044,4221.75,"Councilmember Strauss, I see you have your hand up.",83,,
330,0.97,4221.75,4258.087,"Before I call on you, I did--I did not want to put out there that the bills that are currently being debated in the state Legislature have been introduced, supported and advocated for by very well known established progressive Democrats in the state Legislature and there is an incredible amount of momentum behind those bills.",83,,
331,0.97,4258.087,4266.261,Those bills are being introduced unlike any other period of time in our history during one of the greatest economic crises in over 100 years.,83,,
332,0.97,4266.261,4280.876,"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to support our democratic legislators in Olympia, who are seeing a window of opportunity to actually get something done this session.",83,,
333,0.97,4280.876,4332.261,"I am hopeful and I am supportive and I am also using my relationships with those Democratic leaders and with other leaders in Olympia to make the cases as to why it is important for us to get this progressive tax bills passed through the state Legislature, to meet the needs of thousands of our constituents in Seattle and across the region, who are desperately waiting to see some tax relief and desperately waiting to see additional revenue that will actually meet their basic needs, paying rent, access to making sure they continue to have their business in place.",83,,
334,0.97,4332.261,4393.856,"These are all things we support and these priorities and values, I believe, are shared by representatives, who are fighting like Heck and have been for years to try to get consensus and the votes they need to pass this important legislative pieces at the state Legislature and I think right now, we are on the cusp of that and they are supported by thousands of people, to advance these efforts, and I, for one, stand with them and because I stand with them and those efforts, those priorities and those legislative values are reflected in the city's state legislative lobbying agenda that the counsel in a vote of 8- 0 voted to support and pass in December.",83,,
335,0.97,4393.856,4400.462,That has been the guiding principle and the framework by which our lobby yes has been approaching this work in advocating for.,83,,
336,0.97,4400.462,4406.602,They have not been just introduced laissez-faire on a desk.,83,,
337,0.97,4406.602,4447.242,We've all been actively engaging with and lobbying and encouraging our constituents to do the same in Olympia to make sure that legislators across both Aisles understand why these bills are so important and why they are so important in this historical period of time where we may not have another opportunity to make the strongest case possible for the passage of this very strong progressive revenue tax bills.,83,,
338,0.97,4447.242,4456.585,I think it is important for us to acknowledge the hard work of our state legislatures on the Democratic side of the house and Senate who have been working tirelessly to try to achieve these bills and look forward to continuing to support those efforts.,83,,
339,0.97,4456.585,4465.093,"Thank you, Council President.",84,,
340,0.97,4465.093,4485.247,"The comments have been centered on the fact we have made these priorities clear in a previous resolution and I do want to look at all the work I have been doing to advocate for her sitting priorities in the Legislature and my work with certain cities, that resolutions do not technically deliver to legislators.",84,,
341,0.97,4485.247,4530.492,"They are not necessarily read and we used--your point, that Pssing the legislative priorities resolution is not necessarily ensuring the Follow- up is occurring and I absolutely hear you, which is also why I have been sending letters to different legislatures on different topics, and might be circling back on transportation priorities that I want to get signatures to ensure some of our priorities are met and I have been making phone calls and getting Emails.",84,,
342,0.97,4534.63,4544.973,"What I am stuck with, and something that is very important to me is when I'm speaking with legislators, especially those that are Championing issues I am trying to support, my question is how can I best support you and sometimes that means sending letters and sometimes that means not sending resolutions.",84,,
343,0.97,4544.973,4563.992,"Last year, a similar topic was being discussed at we sent a letter and I found that to be much more effective compared to passing a resolution, especially because we already passed a resolution, so I wanted to talk about that for you wall.",84,,
344,0.97,4563.992,4575.37,"Okay, any other questions, colleagues?",85,,
345,0.97,4575.37,4577.506,"Okay, let's continue on with reports.",85,,
346,0.97,4577.506,4587.783,Next up is Councilmember Strauss.,85,,
347,0.97,4587.783,4603.098,"Thank you, for my report, there are eight Commission appointments on today's introduction in the referral calendar.",86,,
348,0.97,4603.098,4606.034,They were in last week's calendar and they are being Re- referred to the full council.,86,,
349,0.97,4606.034,4607.769,We will skip the step of committee.,86,,
350,0.97,4607.769,4611.173,"We find as we are having our Commission appointments, one meeting is better than coming to two.",86,,
351,0.97,4611.173,4617.245,There are no new items on today's a full agenda and the next meeting is on Saturday 24th at 9:40 in the morning.,86,,
352,0.97,4617.245,4650.746,"Last week, I joined this district meeting to discuss homelessness and was joined by a couple other Councilmembers and I also testified, advocating for the city's priorities, with House bill 1035 to create a local option with tax exemptions for property owners who set aside 25% of their buildings for low income tenants.",86,,
353,0.97,4650.746,4652.881,This was a recommendation that has not been followed through with.,86,,
354,0.97,4652.881,4661.69,I also attended the bill of records meeting on Tuesday and I met with others on Thursday and I have been working with the delegation on the original transportation corridor.,86,,
355,0.97,4661.69,4671.099,"Also, there are a number of fires that the fire departments are responding to in earnest.",86,,
356,0.97,4671.099,4682.611,This was determined to be an arson and they are following up to find out more information and I will reserve my comments until a report is provided.,86,,
357,0.97,4682.611,4694.923,This was ruled as accidental and it is clear people are suffering outside and this has unintended consequences that are rippling through our community.,86,,
358,0.97,4694.923,4699.428,"We cannot continue to live that way, the way it is occurring.",86,,
359,0.97,4699.428,4731.626,"And then many people were left at these areas in the snow and it was heartbreaking to share with them that we do not have the shelter and housing at the level of power homelessness crisis, even with the emergency shelter, it was not enough to bring everyone into weather the storm.",86,,
360,0.97,4731.626,4736.465,"Others said why can't we force people into shelters, and again, we cannot force people into bags and shelters that simply do not exist.",86,,
361,0.97,4736.465,4747.442,"If the shelter does not exist, we cannot ask them to their care because it does not exist.",86,,
362,0.97,4747.442,4760.856,Last week really demonstrated even more clearly the need to have the spectrum of adequate shelter and housing options available at the same rate of the number of people who have Een living outside.,86,,
363,0.97,4760.856,4765.193,"This week, this coming week, we will attend the Fremont Chamber of Commerce meeting on Wednesday at 9:00 in the morning.",86,,
364,0.97,4765.193,4767.596,Councilman Peterson might be a few minutes late to the transportation committee.,86,,
365,0.97,4767.596,4771.166,I will be there as soon as possible.,86,,
366,0.97,4771.166,4774.87,"I will also go to the transit Committee, spending time with a couple of Councilmembers about the Seattle Channel.",86,,

369,0.97,4783.678,4804.566,I have had some conversations with neighbors and we discussed plans to look at the housing Affordability crisis and crime prevention and police accountability and planned to address homelessness and the great work of the initiative to clean Seattle and what they are doing.,86,,
370,0.97,4804.566,4818.747,"I want to thank all the members for giving me your time and we do meet with residents during those hours and in the evening as well, and we will do so again on the 18th.",86,,
371,0.97,4818.747,4823.552,That is my report.,86,,
372,0.97,4823.552,4824.92,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",87,,
373,0.97,4824.92,4830.158,Any comments or questions on that report?,87,,

379,0.97,4850.045,4854.482,This is this bill.,88,,
380,0.97,4854.482,4883.111,I am sure you remember--this was following Councilmember Strauss and his leadership and the building codes being brought to the full council.,88,,
381,0.97,4883.111,4887.015,The fire code has been updated along with the building code in order to ensure consistency and development standards.,88,,
382,0.97,4887.015,4889.684,It was last updated in 2016 and it is usually updated every three years.,88,,
383,0.97,4889.684,4893.688,The updates were delayed because of the public health emergency.,88,,
384,0.97,4893.688,4902.631,There are changes to the fire code that were presented by the Seattle fire Department and changes are relatively minor.,88,,
385,0.97,4902.631,4950.178,"Nevertheless, it plays an important role in public safety and changes included allowing alternative vehicles inside of buildings to maintain their connection in order--they require new integrated testing requirements for High-Rise buildings to ensure fire protection and life safety systems work as intended and are tested at least every 10 years, and then amendment allows fueling like in areas like parking lots, and then a chapter to address electrical storage systems that are regulated by the previous fire code.",88,,
386,0.97,4950.178,4980.442,"We have an amendment to the fire code which was sent out by the central staff on Friday and the amendment is back in page 116 regarding fuel tank storage, someone may notice pages from the fire code attachment and they were amended on purpose and there are no updates to those parts of the fire code in publishing the entire code went violate the International copyright.",88,,
387,0.97,4980.442,4996.624,"116, it does include some changes and the other pages you might notice are missing are intentionally missing.",88,,
388,0.97,4996.624,5031.025,"We have an amendment to the Council President's vaccine resolution and I will hold that in full with her presentation and then as far as items related to the public safety and human services Committee, coming up, there is no committee meeting but I want to mention a few things related to each fire, police, and human services Department.",88,,
389,0.97,5031.025,5058.453,"The fire Department Covid-19 test Administrated for sites, with over 627,000 tests administered until February 11 and then vaccines have been administered, over 4323 vaccines through February 13.",88,,
390,0.97,5058.453,5070.398,These Vaccinations have occurred at 86 adult family homes and 29 affordable housing centers for seniors and at six Pop-Ups.,88,,
391,0.97,5070.398,5123.017,"Now, I think folks are aware that coming out of the public safety and human services committee was a motion indicating that the committee members supporting the motion, they wanted to send a draft bill to the monitor as it relates specifically to the less lethal weapon spell and last week the city attorney's office did share this bill with the monitor and U.S. Department of justice in line with the motion coming out of committee and I believe there is a 45 day time period for the monitor to get us put on that.",88,,
392,0.97,5123.017,5127.122,I will keep the Council apprised as we find out more information.,88,,
393,0.97,5127.122,5131.459,"Now, the motion with the U.S.",88,,
394,0.97,5131.459,5163.391,"District Court regarding policies for the police regarding the use of force and crowd control policies, I think everyone remembers because of the consent decree, there is a schedule for a review and while we have been Deliberating on the less lethal weapons bill, the police Department has been going through the schedule of review for their use of force and policies.",88,,
395,0.97,5163.391,5180.909,There is some overlap with the areas we are recommending legislation for and the review that they are going through for the policies consistent with the consent decree.,88,,
396,0.97,5180.909,5187.015,I want to address a couple of things regarding the human services Department.,88,,

532,0.97,6703.83,6724.551,"So I want to see as you were saying, Council President, the equitable distribution of wealth and brick and mortar businesses who could not find themselves allowed in the marketplace.",94,,
533,0.97,6724.551,6726.019,So I am excited with that.,94,,
534,0.97,6726.019,6728.321,I couldn't agree more.,95,,
535,0.97,6728.321,6747.006,"It's an important Discussio and one that is not just limited to budget Committeebut throughout the year, and I appreciate you saying it's not all doom and gloom.",95,,
536,0.97,6747.006,6747.273,It isn't.,95,,
537,0.97,6747.273,6759.886,There are bright spots out there that we can acknowledge and we can acknowledge that we want to see more of those and have more positive stories coming out of the work that we are doing together.,95,,
538,0.97,6759.886,6761.321,Okay.,95,,
539,0.97,6761.321,6769.929,"Well, are there any other comments or questions?",95,,
540,0.97,6769.929,6770.13,Okay.,95,,
541,0.97,6770.13,6779.139,"Hearing none, we will Segue really smoothly into Councilmember Lewis's report who happens to be the representative for downtown.",95,,
542,0.97,6779.139,6782.675,"Thank you, Madam President.",96,,
543,0.97,6782.675,6796.923,I think I will start my remarks just by saying at the top that I had the pleasure to attend the virtual state of downtown program put on by the downtown Seattle Association.,96,,
544,0.97,6796.923,6841.534,"I won't go into it because of how thorough Councilmember Juarez's report was, but I will say that the report and highlights particularly for our friends in the Nightlife, music, and entertainment industry that have been particularly hit and were the first to close down and will be the last to reopen in the pandemic, and they did a good job of Showcasing the unique struggle that that sector has faced and the unique contribution that the sector makes to the downtown entertainment center and the city which is the heart of what makes us the music capital and a fun cultural state to visit and live in.",96,,
545,0.97,6841.534,6842.402,So I appreciated that.,96,,
546,0.97,6842.402,6865.091,It was a well put on event that highlights the steps that we can do Collaboratively and together to work towards recovery not just for downtown but for the entire city and the recovery of a vibrant downtown core will be critical to the over all vitality of the recovery of the city.,96,,
547,0.97,6865.091,6871.297,So with that I will move on to a couple of other things.,96,,
548,0.97,6871.297,6880.974,There are no Mattersy on the homelessness investments nor do I have any legislation from the Committee on the instruction referral calendar.,96,,
549,0.97,6880.974,6886.779,I want to start just by giving a shout out to on Saturday.,96,,
550,0.97,6886.779,6892.252,I had the great privilege to go and do a ride along in the middle.,96,,
551,0.97,6892.252,6954.981,"Snowstorm with health one which is sort of an impromptu thing that came together by giving a call to the unit to make sure they had everything they needed to outreach to the folks experience experiencing homelessness and get them into shelters and led to an offer to see if I wanted to come along myself and I took advantage of that, and it was real great to see firefighters young and Weber really getting out there in the city parks and Úencampments all over the city to make sure people were aware of the winter shelter options and distribute hats and gloves and hot chocolate to people who were completely exposed to the elements and most critically arrange transport to people who adamantly wanted to get into shelters and were able to access shelters through the direct referral that firefighters young and Weber were able to provide.",96,,
552,0.97,6954.981,6969.195,So a great shout out to the folks at health one and a Testament to the Council's decision last fuel drastically expand the program and look forward to seeing that scaled up this year.,96,,
553,0.97,6969.195,7003.763,I do want to transition on that note that the 545 spaces that the Council funded in our budget in November to provide more long-term shelter for folks who are experiencing homelessness still have not seen any of the units stood up despite it being several months since the Council made the appropriation.,96,,
554,0.97,7003.763,7008.968,My Council will be meeting on the homeless on investments.,96,,
555,0.97,7008.968,7022.448,"And as folks are aware there is a standing agenda item in the committee to provide updates on the Council shelter surge, budget priority to be included in the budget November.",96,,
556,0.97,7022.448,7034.894,"Just a reminder it included 120 tiny houses, 125 enhance shelter placements, and 300 hotel rooms.",96,,
557,0.97,7034.894,7042.935,"As of this time, I'm unaware that any of the positions have yet been stood up yet.",96,,
558,0.97,7042.935,7066.292,"As Councilmember Strauss alluded to earlier, when events come up like a smoke--fire smoke in the summer or snowstorms in the winter, it makes the lack of shelter that we are currently offering a more profound problem in terms of the hazards that folks experiencing homelessness are exposed to.",96,,
559,0.97,7066.292,7103.196,"I do want to request going forward just for members of the public and for this Council and we'll send this again in Email but that for this meeting, towards the end of this month that we get a detailed presentation from the human services Department on the state of all three of those investments, and if there are hurdles to their implementation, an identification process on what precisely the hurdles are and how this Council can stand ready to assist the executive and implementation of the critical access.",96,,
560,0.97,7103.196,7112.538,"Just, for example, is the amount of money that was appropriated not sufficient to realize the shelter options?",96,,
561,0.97,7112.538,7123.015,Are there regulations or Rurals that need to be waived and are those within the power of the city council?,96,,
562,0.97,7123.015,7126.519,Does the state Legislature or officials need to weigh in?,96,,
563,0.97,7126.519,7133.459,Are those things within the power of the government to expedite the expanding of the assets?,96,,
564,0.97,7133.459,7159.752,"I want us to work together as the Council and executives given that we are now in the middle of February and those positions are not yet realized and really identify where we all want to go, the 545 that are stood up and work backward on the hurdles we need to overcome to make it a reality.",96,,
565,0.97,7159.752,7179.272,"I will send that request in Email form as well to the human services Department, and we will expect the update on the two Ofth--24th to work through the hurdles together.",96,,
566,0.97,7179.272,7192.451,I have a couple of other meet this is week they will highlight briefly.,96,,
567,0.97,7192.451,7218.811,"Will join Councilmember Mosqueda later this week, and I will join the meeting on the issues facing the city especially the response to the Homeness crisis, and with that, Madam President, I don't have any additional updates and appreciate the opportunity to get started on this short week.",96,,
568,0.97,7218.811,7222.381,Thank you so much Councilmember Lewis.,97,,
569,0.97,7222.381,7231.824,"I have a quick question, and I think it might be a share responsibility between you and Councilmember Mosqueda as chair of the Finance Committee.",97,,
570,0.97,7231.824,7251.51,I know you brought up the issue of implementation of reimbursement on issues related to sheltering and Non- congregate sheltering in particular during the pandemic.,97,,
571,0.97,7251.51,7280.439,And I'm wondering if it's part of the regular monthly reporting if it would be helpful or useful to incorporate a status report or any kind of briefing also related to some of the Federal dollar issues related specifically to increasing our Healthcare capacity during the pandemic.,97,,
572,0.97,7280.439,7307.3,And I guess what I am trying to do is find synergy and Connectivity between how finite our dollars are and a complementary supplement to those that we already funded.,97,,
573,0.97,7307.3,7307.933,Where are they?,97,,
574,0.97,7307.933,7311.871,"And we have dollars for that, and why isn't happening and what's the plan?",97,,
575,0.97,7311.871,7325.651,And then there is the issue of the other additional potential revenue sources and opportunities available to us that are emerging from the Federal Government.,97,,
576,0.97,7325.651,7337.463,"How are we tying those together to really create that shelter capacity that we Sneed, not just for the now but moving on.",97,,
577,0.97,7337.463,7337.73,Yeah.,98,,
578,0.97,7337.73,7355.815,"I--I think including those kinds of questions which were alluded to a little bit, I think, in our committee meeting last month and with Councilmember Mosqueda will be important to dive into in this conversation.",98,,
579,0.97,7355.815,7365.791,I think it's definitely of interest from what I've gathered from the executives to try and seek a reimbursement particularly for the Hoteling.,98,,
580,0.97,7365.791,7377.837,"But since those plans are Aready funded and established, that is where, as you bring up, Madam President, the supplementation argument.",98,,
581,0.97,7377.837,7387.079,These are things we were already doing and now we're coming in and saying it's directly responsive to emergency--like sequencing.,98,,
582,0.97,7387.079,7391.283,We are doing the shelter surge because it's intensified because of Covid.,98,,
583,0.97,7391.283,7395.955,So it should be an argument we can make.,98,,
584,0.97,7395.955,7430.055,"I think regardless of the success of that, there is probably ample scope given the new guidance from the Biden administration to pursue a completely new and more expansive Hoteling policy where we would not run into that supplementation argument because we aren't conceived of it yet and we can be conceiving of it in response to the new Biden administration policy that provides more generous reinbursement.",98,,
585,0.97,7430.055,7437.53,We know a lot of other jurisdictions are squaring the circle effectively.,98,,
586,0.97,7437.53,7450.943,"Los Angeles has their operation key card or something like that, a hotel policy where they are saying publically and it was covered in the media that they are getting 100 percent FEMA reimbursement for that.",98,,
587,0.97,7450.943,7459.452,"If that's the case, I don't see why we cannot also do that.",98,,
588,0.97,7459.452,7464.223,So that will be something else we'll be digging into.,98,,
589,0.97,7464.223,7488.414,"As you well know we have a lot of community Stakeholders coming to the Council and going to other local governments, particularly King County with hotels, with provider plans, with everything kind of set up, and they need a government contractor to provide the money.",98,,
590,0.97,7488.414,7491.55,It seems like we are ready to go.,98,,
591,0.97,7491.55,7500.559,It's just a matter of--it's adjust a matter of getting the resources out the door but this is an ongoing conversation.,98,,
592,0.97,7500.559,7500.826,Yeah.,99,,
593,0.97,7500.826,7575.868,"I think the reason I brought up this issue is specifically related to some of the stories nationally that I have been seeing of major cities taking what seems to be better advantage as it relates to Hoteling, and I wonder if in the spirit of correcting connect Ivity if it would be useful--I would find it useful to have a conversation in your Committee or Councilmember Mosqueda's committee to get a better understanding of how the cities are using the program and get us a better understanding of what we need to do on our end to take advantage of the programming that allows for 100 percent reimbursement for hotel rooms for the congregate shelter options and help us to immediately increase our shelter capacity.",99,,
594,0.97,7575.868,7579.538,"Just one more question, Madam President.",100,,
595,0.97,7579.538,7592.551,I know another people want to jump in but it's not just the Council that's interested and not just sort of you know Left- leaning Damagic Socialist on Twitter.,100,,
596,0.97,7592.551,7670.029,"The group I probably talk to more about this is the downtown Seattle Association, the Alliance for Pioneer square who are eager to see the city expand the Hoteling-Based service platforms who are the big business advocacy groups in the city another question would be is that I hope that in addition to nailing down a lot of these logistical hurdles, I don't really see what the political constituency is in the city that is opposed to this because the small businesses--I mean, we are talking rightly about the people experiencing homelessness who are experiencing extreme hazards of life and safety from the elements and everything else that desperately need to take advantage of programs like this as part of our humanitarian city, and it's also small business owners who have Encampments in front of their businesses or small business owners who have to take on a role who are De- escalating people experiencing mental illness in their business.",100,,
597,0.97,7670.029,7670.496,It helps everybody.,100,,
598,0.97,7670.496,7677.503,"I know the Council has a sense of urgency about it, and I want to uplift that the Coligdz for this is very broad.",100,,
599,0.97,7677.503,7689.081,I hope that we can figure out a way for the Council and the Mayor to actually make it happen.,100,,
600,0.97,7689.081,7698.757,There is no one really against this.,100,,
601,0.97,7698.757,7702.628,And get through recovery.,100,,
602,0.97,7702.628,7707.332,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you have been in the Cue for a while.",101,,
603,0.97,7707.332,7707.633,Go ahead.,101,,
604,0.97,7707.633,7725.317,"We have things in the budget from four months ago in the budget to be implemented yet, and I think you are correct that we have to monitor and implement the accountability throughout process and make sure there is a follow through.",102,,
605,0.97,7725.317,7731.99,There hasn't been a follow through that the Council finds satisfactory on Hoteling and tiny houses.,102,,
606,0.97,7731.99,7745.003,And the other side is making sure that we have a full understanding of what Federal dollars are available to the city and how it's deployed and how quickly we can expect to see relief in the community.,102,,
607,0.97,7745.003,7779.538,"This is a preview of what I will note in my presentation but on Friday at 9:30 in the Finance and housing committee we asked the director and his team to present on the Covid relief dollars and update on the Federal funding that Seattle will be receiving and specifically how funds will be used for the Hoteling strategy, and you noted with Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Herbold has been sending me news clips about this as well.",102,,
608,0.97,7779.538,7800.359,"We've seen national coverage, for example, in San Francisco so that the shelter in place hotels in San Francisco which was slated to close last year have notice that they will be able to receive 100 percent of the Federal funds reimbursed.",102,,
609,0.97,7800.359,7801.627,That was dated January 22.,102,,
610,0.97,7801.627,7811.57,Here we are trying to get a better sense of how Federal dollars can be used here.,102,,
611,0.97,7811.57,7828.787,"The Los Angeles program, project room key, is an initiative that allows for individuals who are experiencing homelessness to be sheltered in hotel rooms and they received notice they will get 100 percent of the cost reimbursed by FEMA.",102,,
612,0.97,7828.787,7835.828,"And Mayor Garcetti was saying how excited they were to move forward on February 4, again, a week and a half ago.",102,,
613,0.97,7835.828,7879.838,Part of the conversation on Friday will really be to drive home the point that was made today and last week and last month that we want the Federal dollars that should be used in partnership and simultaneous to the dollars that we have already allocated especially going back to the committee meeting that we had a few weeks ago where it was noted how--how individuals who have been living outside are very likely to have multiple compounding crisis that they are dealing with which equals a need for greater assistance.,102,,
614,0.97,7879.838,7882.541,We cannot be going to the lowest denominator.,102,,
615,0.97,7882.541,7898.957,"We need to make sure we have the source, and a preview for Friday's meeting we have been getting additional information on the time it takes to get reimbursed.",102,,
616,0.97,7898.957,7907.199,And Councilmember Herbold and I were there and we heard they were getting reimbursed in six months.,102,,
617,0.97,7907.199,7916.608,So a six month reimburse settlement great news and a 100 percent reimbursement for this is fantastic especially while it's snowing outside.,102,,
618,0.97,7916.608,7929.921,I look forward to working with you on this and will tune in on Friday for more on that.,102,,
619,0.97,7929.921,7935.427,They--thank you so much for that additional information.,103,,
620,0.97,7935.427,7941.833,Any other questions or comments for Councilmember Lewis on his report?,103,,
621,0.97,7941.833,7942.034,Okay.,103,,
622,0.97,7942.034,7956.448,"Hearing none, let's go ahead and hear from Councilmember Morales, and then from Councilmember Mosqueda.",103,,
623,0.97,7956.448,7957.783,"Good morning, everyone.",104,,
624,0.97,7957.783,7966.291,There are no items on the agenda from the economic development committee.,104,,
625,0.97,7966.291,7988.814,"Our next meeting is Friday 26 at 9:30, so looking forward to that and looking for the final report for the black history research project and look forward to sharing that with you, and the arts Department is working to bring more black concerts to the social media channels.",104,,
626,0.97,7988.814,8000.625,This is beginning in black history month and the partnership will continue throughout the year so that they can highlight and honor black businesses and artists in the city.,104,,
627,0.97,8000.625,8008.9,So looking forward to learning more throughout the year.,104,,
628,0.97,8008.9,8020.612,"Last week, the Mayor announced that ca Milla banks will be stepping into an office that was extraordinarily business supporting our small businesses through the Covid crisis.",104,,
629,0.97,8020.612,8030.389,I look forward to working with Ms. banks to bring the economic recovery process--to begin the process.,104,,
630,0.97,8030.389,8063.488,"And we have been talking about today we know that it's going to be really important that we find not just sort of normal steps we take and not just normal steps for recovery but focus on an equitable recovery for the commercial district, for downtown, or for a regional recovery here and really to look at different strategies for different levels and neighborhoods.",104,,
631,0.97,8063.488,8085.277,"I want to say also as Councilmember Juarez was saying, we know that there were businesses leaving downtown even before the Covid crisis hit, and so we may need to think differently or more creatively about what downtown means so it's not just shopping particularly as so much shopping moves Online.",104,,
632,0.97,8085.277,8100.358,I think it's an opportunity for us to make downtown more equitable or affordable and bring young people or young families back downtown to live and enjoy the cultural aspects that we have.,104,,
633,0.97,8100.358,8113.038,So there are a lot of work to do this year and the next several years as we think carefully about what an equitable recovery is for the city.,104,,
634,0.97,8113.038,8131.957,"I do want to let folks know that the applications are available for the 50th Northwest festival with a virtual marketplace and small businesses and Crafters, and artists can apply to be vendors.",104,,
635,0.97,8131.957,8142.534,"It's a Memorial day event, and speaking of small business, last week I intended the grand opening of Queen care products at 23rd and Jackson.",104,,
636,0.97,8142.534,8148.573,It's great to see Black-Owned businesses coming back to the central district.,104,,
637,0.97,8148.573,8160.185,I want to congratulate my friend and constituent Monica Matthews who opened the first queen care in Columbia city a few years ago.,104,,
638,0.97,8160.185,8187.512,"It's been really special to watch her idea for special Enterprisement to support the entrepreneurial skills for young people and to watch that grow in her second location, so congratulations to Monica and all the young queens who have worked so hard to make that happen.",104,,
639,0.97,8187.512,8199.224,"Last week, I met with constituents in the Rainier Beach area including a couple of initiatives, a beautiful safe place for youth that we have started here.",104,,
640,0.97,8199.224,8207.032,We have been talking about with and about the save way and the safety of their parking lot.,104,,
641,0.97,8207.032,8212.137,Safeway has agreed to replace the lights in the parking lot with strong L.E.D.,104,,
642,0.97,8212.137,8212.504,Lights there.,104,,
643,0.97,8212.504,8231.022,And we are meeting again this evening to continue those discussions and look forward to some positive relationships with them to improve the safety of that parking lot in the neighborhood.,104,,
644,0.97,8231.022,8235.293,Also met with constituents about several other things this weekend.,104,,
645,0.97,8235.293,8242.867,I met with a 74-Year-Old constituent who told me about the hours she spent trying to get an appointment for the Covid vaccine.,104,,
646,0.97,8242.867,8254.312,"She and others are frustrated by the lack of clear information about whether supply is actually available, not just whether there is an appointment available.",104,,
647,0.97,8254.312,8261.253,And told me several stories about the Byzantine efforts she was going through to get the vaccine.,104,,
648,0.97,8261.253,8266.157,She has yet to be able to do.,104,,
649,0.97,8266.157,8273.698,I do want to thank Council President Gonzalez and Councilmember Herbold for the meetings last week.,104,,
650,0.97,8273.698,8286.511,They provided some specific steps that we should be taking as a city and a region to share greater equity with the vaccine.,104,,
651,0.97,8286.511,8293.885,I also met with someone who wanted to get more culturally appropriate food into the emergency food system.,104,,
652,0.97,8293.885,8324.215,"You may know that our food banks rely on donations and the relationship with more large grocers which is how they get supply and the quantity of food that they need but it's not necessarily cultural specific food that our food insecure neighbors need, and there is an understanding with how the city might work with the immigrant communities rather than only funding the food banks.",104,,
653,0.97,8324.215,8327.352,So we will be holding a conversation.,104,,
654,0.97,8327.352,8336.561,I have district hours this Sunday afternoon and folks can sign up on our Website.,104,,
655,0.97,8336.561,8352.677,One last thing I want to say is I am thankful for the work that the workers did over the snowy weekend.,104,,
