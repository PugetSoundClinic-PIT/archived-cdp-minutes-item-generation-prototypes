12,0.97,122.956,128.995,A few out in Ballard.,2,,
13,0.97,128.995,136.269,And we continue to hear about other incidents also and one at the Sodo parking lot of home Depot.,2,,
14,0.97,136.269,148.948,There is this poignant behavior to target people based on their Ethnicity in response to the run a virus.,2,,
15,0.97,148.948,160.293,We have an obligation to speak loudly against those types of behaviors and that type of racism.,2,,
16,0.97,160.293,164.664,And it will not be tolerated.,2,,
17,0.97,164.664,165.465,This virus impacts all of us the.,2,,
18,0.97,165.465,170.236,No one is to blame for it.,2,,
19,0.97,170.236,177.41,On we are not going to allow hate to drive our response in the city.,2,,
20,0.97,177.41,199.566,And I as Council president and is a resident of the city call upon all of our constituents to exercise vigilance and protecting each other and protecting our neighbors and in speaking out against these types of racist attacks on our neighbors throughout the city of Seattle and across the country.,2,,
21,0.97,199.566,214.647,It is important for us to take a moment to acknowledge that there have been these really disturbing incidents happening across the city.,2,,
22,0.97,214.647,229.829,I want to encourage the police Department to continue to investigate those cases and cool and folks who may have relation or any information on this to collaborate and provide information to law enforcement to make sure those folks are held accountable.,2,,
23,0.97,229.829,247.046,And my most sincere thoughts and concerns continue to go out to those who were impacted by these atrocious acts and to all members of the community in the city of Seattle.,2,,
24,0.97,247.046,260.46,And for them to know that we stand with them and we are ready to support them in the face of these extremely horrific acts that are happening in our community.,2,,
25,0.97,260.46,267.5,I will end my remarks there and provide folks an opportunity to also provide remarks if you are interested in providing reaction or comments.,2,,
26,0.97,267.5,275.008,"To that point, just raise your hand and let me know.",2,,
27,0.97,275.008,278.811,It looks like we don't have anybody that wants to make comments right now.,2,,
28,0.97,278.811,289.589,Let's move into the presentation on counsel bill 119799 related to premium pay for gig workers.,2,,
29,0.97,289.589,297.63,We have Karina bull who is prepared to make the presentation.,2,,
30,0.97,297.63,306.339,Both the bill and the presentation are on the published agenda for counsel briefing.,2,,
31,0.97,306.339,321.788,I'm going to go ahead and hand it over to Councilmember Lewis for some introductory remarks and then we will go ahead and hear from Karina Bull.,2,,
32,0.97,321.788,327.193,Thank you counsel.,3,,
33,0.97,327.193,332.098,And I want to give Councilmember Herbold an opportunity to make a few remarks as well before we hear from Karina Bull.,3,,
34,0.97,332.098,341.874,And I want to thank Karina bull for her diligence and assistance with this.,3,,
35,0.97,341.874,349.849,But has been two weeks of really heavy work and I look forward to discussing the final product.,3,,
36,0.97,349.849,371.037,"As everyone is aware, about a month ago, we ratified the historic executive order capping restaurant fees for a lot of our neighborhood small business restaurants who have been facing exuberant fees being passed on to them in this climate and where Take- out is there only option.",3,,
37,0.97,371.037,380.279,Part of the discussion had been a lot of the economy workers.,3,,
38,0.97,380.279,381.447,And I call it the economy rather than the gig economy.,3,,
39,0.97,381.447,391.324,"Because with Covid-19, what we refer to is a massive share of how all of us are getting goods and how a lot of people are being employed to do it.",3,,
40,0.97,391.324,429.662,"And really learning about the barriers from continuing those conversations after that and we heard from people who are doing the work that in a lot of cases, since they are Mischaracterized as independent contractors, they need to buy cleaning supplies and take Uncompensated time between deliveries to clean vehicles can these are all things they are not compensated for and it has been a burden to the bottom line in this environment.",3,,
41,0.97,429.662,453.653,"And increasingly, while there are a lot of considerations for other folks working in this economy, no jurisdictions yet have really taken on some kind of consideration in the form of pay, that these uniquely situated workers were not hourly employees who are not collectively bargained contract holders.",3,,
42,0.97,453.653,475.074,And this legislation will take a large step towards having a more equitable treatment for these essential front-line workers and I'm proud to sponsor this today and be working with Karina Bull and Councilmember Herbold who helped put this together.,3,,
43,0.97,475.074,486.385,"With that, I think I will hand over to Councilmember Herbold and I look forward to Karina bull's presentation.",3,,
44,0.97,486.385,486.519,.,3,,
45,0.97,486.519,496.295,"Councilmember Lewis, thank you for the overview.",4,,
46,0.97,496.295,508.741,It is very helpful for the context of the public health emergency and the fact that these workers are not hourly workers whereas many workers who are considered essential workers are hourly workers.,4,,
47,0.97,508.741,514.213,Some of them are receiving premium pay.,4,,
48,0.97,514.213,526.292,It is important that people get paid for their time and the materials they use practicing best practices as it relates to public health.,4,,
49,0.97,526.292,536.402,I also want to thank all of the Stakeholders who have been involved thus far . Both on the labor side.,4,,
50,0.97,536.402,544.277,"We have had strong participation from Washington, the teamsters.",4,,
51,0.97,544.277,564.463,We also have spent a lot of time over the last couple of weeks talking with industry Stakeholders and have had probably about six individual meetings with the impacted industry to talk through their concerns around the bill.,4,,
52,0.97,564.463,567.9,That is all I have right now.,4,,
53,0.97,567.9,577.176,I'm happy to answer questions that folks might have after Karina's presentation.,4,,
54,0.97,577.176,578.21,Thank you Councilmembers Herbold and Lewis.,5,,
55,0.97,578.21,586.485,Let's go ahead and have Karina go through her presentation.,5,,
56,0.97,586.485,589.989,We are scheduled to be here for about 30 minutes.,5,,
57,0.97,589.989,601.1,"I'm going to ask Councilmembers to hold their questions until Karina has gone all the way through her presentation and then if you have questions, I will call for them at the end.",5,,
58,0.97,601.1,613.679,"You also can send me a quick text message or use the chat function to let me know that you will have questions and I will make sure to start the Q. so Karina, off to you.",5,,
59,0.97,613.679,614.18,Thank you so much.,6,,
60,0.97,614.18,614.547,Good morning.,6,,
61,0.97,614.547,618.417,I'm Karina Bull.,6,,
62,0.97,618.417,623.122,I'm supporting the drafting of this bill.,6,,
63,0.97,623.122,646.345,"To begin, as Councilmembers Herbold and Lewis already Teed up for listeners and watchers, the legislation would essentially require delivery network companies and transportation network companies to provide gig workers who are providing services for their businesses with premium pay for work that is performed and Seattle.",6,,
64,0.97,646.345,653.285,And the legislation would declare an emergency which means it would have an immediately effective date.,6,,
65,0.97,653.285,654.62,Here is the roadmap for the short presentation this morning.,6,,
66,0.97,654.62,665.331,We will begin with coverage . This will be familiar to folks who have been following the paid gig workers legislation.,6,,
67,0.97,665.331,669.835,The covering hiring entities and gig workers are the same.,6,,
68,0.97,669.835,683.315,And so the entities covered are the food delivery network companies with 250 or more gig workers worldwide and the gig workers accepting offers and providing delivery and transportation services.,6,,
69,0.97,683.315,693.726,The definitions of these entities again are the same as for the time legislation.,6,,
70,0.97,693.726,695.127,And you can see the definitions on the Powerpoint presentation.,6,,
71,0.97,695.127,711.844,"The food delivery network company, it is an Online enabled application or platform to connect customers with workers for delivery from one or more of the following institutions.",6,,
72,0.97,711.844,726.959,"Eating and drinking establishment, food processing establishment, grocery store or any facility, whether or not it is open to the public, that is intended to fulfill customer orders from a business that is delivering groceries or prepared food and beverages.",6,,
73,0.97,726.959,727.593,Transportation network company.,6,,
74,0.97,727.726,732.865,That is the same definition also in the tea and see Deactivation rights ordinance.,6,,
75,0.97,732.865,743.275,"That would be Uber, Lyft, a Nonexhaustive lift.",6,,
76,0.97,743.275,748.647,"Uber Eades, grill, Doordash, Instacart, post mates and others.",6,,
77,0.97,748.647,757.089,The workers are providing the services and this is the heart of the bill.,6,,
78,0.97,757.089,767.366,This would require $5 payment for each Online order with a Work-Related stop in Seattle that they get a worker performs.,6,,
79,0.97,767.366,784.783,This stop in Seattle would mean any kind of commercial stop and Seattle to define it in the negative would not include personal Errands or refueling or driving through Seattle from a beginning point and end point outside of Seattle.,6,,
80,0.97,784.783,798.798,"If there is any Online order that has associated services with it that involves stopping in Seattle, it would be covered and it would require $5 payment to the worker.",6,,
81,0.97,798.798,808.14,"It is in addition to what they are already being paid for providing the services, bonuses, Commission and also separate from any tips they might earn from a customer.",6,,
82,0.97,808.14,822.655,So an example might be that a delivery driver has an Online order for delivery in Everett and they are shopping at a grocery store in North Seattle.,6,,
83,0.97,822.655,823.489,That would incur the $5 premium pay.,6,,
84,0.97,823.489,831.297,"Even though the delivery point is in Everett, the shopping is actually taking place in Seattle.",6,,
85,0.97,831.297,849.949,"If there was an Online order that involves shopping at a store in Seattle or anywhere that had one or more delivery points, there would be $5 for the first amount of work that happened in Seattle and then an additional $5 for any additional Jumpoff point in Seattle.",6,,
86,0.97,849.949,861.927,"So if someone is shopping in Seattle, the four delivery points and Seattle, that would be $20 and premium pay.",6,,
87,0.97,861.927,876.709,"If one of the drop off points was south of Seattle, the additional drop off point would not incur the charge because it was happening outside of Seattle.",6,,
88,0.97,876.709,879.879,There also are transparency requirements with this legislation.,6,,
89,0.97,879.879,892.558,"When I gig worker is being paid, the premium pay, the hiring entity must include notification of which Online orders qualify for the premium pay and then itemize the premium pay separate from other compensation.",6,,
90,0.97,892.558,901.7,This would allow the gig workers to know that they have earned it and they have been paying for it as well.,6,,
91,0.97,901.7,908.007,The other requirements in the legislation are typical for Seattle labor standards.,7,,
92,0.97,908.007,909.608,A notice of rights that must be provided to each gig worker.,7,,
93,0.97,909.608,917.917,Record-Keeping by the hiring entities for three years.,7,,
94,0.97,917.917,920.152,Retaliation is Cohabited.,7,,
95,0.97,920.152,921.053,And enforcement standard for Seattle.,7,,
96,0.97,921.053,925.991,Labor standards and the office of labor standards would be authorized to conduct outreach and develop rules.,7,,
97,0.97,925.991,926.926,There would be a private right of action.,7,,
98,0.97,926.926,942.942,The remedies would include any unpaid compensation which means any premium pay owed pick up to three times that amount depending on the severity of the violation.,7,,
99,0.97,942.942,947.379,"Penalties payable to the city, the gig worker . The duration of the legislation has two components.",7,,
100,0.97,947.379,955.254,The first component is the premium pay owed for the duration of the Mayor's emergency order.,7,,
101,0.97,955.254,969.335,"If the city were to pass a minimum compensation for gig workers, then the Council, as the legislation States, would consider eliminating the premium pay requirement perhaps before the determination of the Mayor's emergency order.",7,,
102,0.97,969.335,981.013,"The rest of the legislation that relates to the Record-Keeping, enforcement and the notice of rights and Anti- retaliation, would stay in effect after the premium pay requirement ends.",7,,
103,0.97,981.013,988.32,And it would be automatically repealed three years after the end of the civil emergency is terminated.,7,,
104,0.97,988.32,1002.935,The reason for the extended time for the rest of the law is that so Ols can in the state alleged violations and keeping the records for that period of time.,7,,
105,0.97,1002.935,1012.745,And then the request for any proposed amendments by Thursday at noon to make sure those can be drafted and removed.,7,,
106,0.97,1012.745,1018.45,"June 1ST, there is an opportunity for a full council vote.",7,,
107,0.97,1018.45,1019.084,And that is the presentation.,7,,
108,0.97,1019.084,1019.485,Thank you.,7,,
109,0.97,1019.485,1027.86,"Thank you, Karina for that presentation.",8,,
110,0.97,1027.86,1038.804,"Colleagues, now is the opportunity to ask any questions or make comments regarding the proposed legislation . are there any questions, colleagues?",8,,
111,0.97,1038.804,1040.906,Councilmember Peterson please.,8,,
112,0.97,1040.906,1048.58,Thank you and good morning colleagues.,9,,
113,0.97,1048.58,1049.148,I have a question.,9,,
114,0.97,1049.148,1053.051,If you can talk more about how you arrived at the $5 and where that number came from.,9,,
115,0.97,1053.051,1059.625,I would appreciate that.,9,,
116,0.97,1059.625,1068.133,That is probably a good question for the sponsors.,10,,
117,0.97,1068.133,1073.005,"Councilmember Herbold or Lewis, would you like to take that question?",10,,
118,0.97,1073.005,1079.111,Guest: I can jump in.,11,,
119,0.97,1079.111,1082.681,I should have addressed that in my opening remarks.,12,,
120,0.97,1082.681,1083.982,I'm glad you are giving me that opportunity to address it now.,12,,
121,0.97,1083.982,1091.557,Number is based on the formula for the partners in the labor community we have been working on with this.,12,,
122,0.97,1091.557,1108.307,"Based on that level of premium pay, this would add up on average over one hour for an average number of deliveries to something that Approximates a $15 minimum wage.",12,,
123,0.97,1108.307,1131.23,The design of this was pegged to get the independent contractor workers up to a point where they are making what is similarly situated hourly employee would be making somewhere else in the economy during this Covid-19 time in our community.,12,,
124,0.97,1131.23,1131.964,That is where that comes from.,12,,
125,0.97,1131.964,1139.171,We definitely will be talking about that formula more as we start talking about this legislation more.,12,,
126,0.97,1139.171,1155.153,"I'm also happy to share that information more broadly with other members of the Council has we have this conversation as a counsel and I will definitely send that your way, Councilmember Pedersen.",12,,
127,0.97,1155.153,1160.392,"Councilmember Herbold, is there anything you would like to add?",13,,
128,0.97,1160.392,1188.554,I think conceptually it is important to about the premium pay and it is a concept that combines both hazard pay to pay associated with the risk individuals are taking to do essential work as well as pay for people's time and the cost associated with supplies.,14,,
129,0.97,1188.554,1205.137,"At a recent public hearing--last week's meeting, we heard a testify or speak to the fact that they were out laying sometimes as much as $100 a week with cleaning supplies.",14,,
130,0.97,1205.137,1235.867,"When I say conceptually, think of this as a combination both of pay to compensate people for the risk they are putting themselves in harms way to do this essential work and the cost associated with the time and supplies necessary to do this important work that makes the provisions of essential work Compliant with public health best practices.",14,,
131,0.97,1235.867,1249.214,"The reason it is important to think of those things together is, remember many of our hourly employees who are essential workers are getting part of that.",14,,
132,0.97,1249.214,1249.781,The hazard pay part.,14,,
133,0.97,1249.781,1260.759,They are already being paid the hourly wage and they are already being paid for the provision of the products.,14,,
134,0.97,1260.759,1266.598,And some of those folks are getting $2 just for the hazard pay part.,14,,
135,0.97,1266.598,1270.936,Just for the part related to putting yourself in harm's way.,14,,
136,0.97,1270.936,1284.216,They are being paid because they are hourly workers working for a company that pays for the goods and products necessary to keep the workstation clean.,14,,
137,0.97,1284.216,1298.297,"Hearing Councilmember Lewis talk about the formula, it is important to keep in mind the foundation for the three major components.",14,,
138,0.97,1298.297,1298.697,Thank you.,14,,
139,0.97,1298.697,1341.139,"I have one last thing to throw in there . One piece of context we should bear in mind--and I want to preface this by saying that things do differ somewhat across platforms and across different sectors of this gig economy environment, but typically for food delivery folks at least, the information we have from the labor partners is, per job, they are netting as low as two, $2.05 per job that a delivery can take on average 30 minutes.",15,,
140,0.97,1341.139,1348.28,"In some cases, folks are only noting in one hour delivery time somewhere between four or $5 total.",15,,
141,0.97,1348.28,1353.285,So that is an important thing to remember.,15,,
142,0.97,1353.285,1356.388,It is just a really precarious place for a lot of these folks who are doing is really critical work.,15,,
143,0.97,1356.388,1377.676,Especially in the environment where they have a lot of additional expenses there were not expecting and similarly situated hourly employees do not need to assume in the jobs they are doing so I just wanted to throw in that piece of content.,15,,
144,0.97,1377.676,1377.976,Great.,16,,
145,0.97,1377.976,1379.644,"Councilmember Pedersen, any follow-up questions regarding that or comments?",16,,
146,0.97,1379.644,1382.714,No think you.,17,,
147,0.97,1382.714,1388.22,Okay.,18,,
148,0.97,1388.22,1405.937,"Colleagues, any other questions for counsel central staff or sponsors of the bill? a very quiet group this morning.",18,,
149,0.97,1405.937,1415.247,I'm so impressed of this morning you guys.,18,,
150,0.97,1415.247,1416.014,Was somebody trying to speak?,18,,
151,0.97,1416.014,1416.848,This is Councilmember Mosqueda.,19,,
152,0.97,1416.848,1418.784,I have a quick question.,19,,
153,0.97,1418.784,1419.151,Wonderful.,20,,
154,0.97,1419.151,1434.232,"Looking at slide six, notification of qualifying orders and premium pay, are we assuming the premium pay will be passed on to the consumer in any way based on your conversations?",20,,
155,0.97,1434.232,1443.608,"Do you want to take that, Karina?",21,,
156,0.97,1443.608,1444.142,Or should I?,21,,
157,0.97,1444.142,1469.734,"Is the legislation now or in a forthcoming bill, with language stating that the charges should not be passed on to the customers.",22,,
158,0.97,1469.734,1471.77,That is all it was going to add.,23,,
159,0.97,1471.77,1492.29,"I believe in the retaliation section, we had talked about adding language prohibiting the cost being passed on to customers as well as prohibiting the dialing down of the compensation for drivers.",23,,
160,0.97,1492.29,1506.338,And some of the Record-Keeping requirements will help with enforcement of that.,23,,
161,0.97,1507.672,1507.906,Great.,24,,
162,0.97,1507.906,1509.407,"Colleagues, any other questions?",24,,
163,0.97,1509.407,1515.447,I have one more comment.,25,,
164,0.97,1515.447,1522.02,I know there are concerns about the proposal coming out of the Mayor's office.,25,,
165,0.97,1522.02,1530.161,"Hopefully this summer or early fall, associated with minimum compensation of drivers.",25,,
166,0.97,1530.161,1550.548,And I want to clarify that we do have language in this bill that expresses the counsel's intent to ensure that this compensation we are considering now is not layered on top of the minimum compensation legislation.,25,,
167,0.97,1550.548,1557.289,Whereas we have a sunset date that the bill will sunset after the state of emergency.,25,,
168,0.97,1557.289,1574.673,"We do have some specific language in there that says if the minimum compensation language law is put into place before that, that we intend to roll this requirement back.",25,,
169,0.97,1574.673,1577.008,Obviously intended to address the concerns of the Mayor's office and many of the Stakeholders we met with.,25,,
170,0.97,1577.008,1582.514,Thank you Councilmember Herbold for that.,26,,
171,0.97,1582.514,1587.519,That was on the list of one of my questions.,26,,
172,0.97,1587.519,1604.402,"There was a point talking about how if the city passes the minimum compensation standard for Tmz drivers, then the Council will take a different look at this particular ordinance or the ordinance will sunset sooner.",26,,
173,0.97,1604.402,1612.677,I appreciate you making a note of that.,26,,
174,0.97,1612.677,1632.163,"And Karina, in terms of your work on this particular legislation, do you have a sense of where these drivers rank in terms of volume of work that they are seeing relative to other parts of the country?",26,,
175,0.97,1632.163,1642.207,There has been a dramatic reduction in work.,27,,
176,0.97,1642.207,1649.214,I think there is 80% drop in volume of for hire rides in Seattle.,27,,
177,0.97,1649.214,1654.285,The food delivery workers have seen a dramatic increase in their work.,27,,
178,0.97,1654.285,1659.124,I think that is probably true throughout the rest of the country.,27,,
179,0.97,1659.124,1664.195,I don't have any data to support that is happening around the rest of the country but I think common sense shows that is indeed happening.,27,,
180,0.97,1664.195,1670.602,There are a lot of deliveries in Seattle and around the country today.,27,,
181,0.97,1670.602,1681.579,So no concrete data that would tell us exactly where the Delta is relative to the type of driver?,28,,
182,0.97,1681.579,1685.583,In terms of how many deliveries or passenger trips they are doing per hour?,29,,
183,0.97,1685.583,1689.721,Yes.,30,,
184,0.97,1689.721,1693.625,Not to my knowledge.,31,,
185,0.97,1693.625,1702.1,"Colleagues, any other questions or comments before we move along?",32,,
186,0.97,1702.1,1702.6,Councilmember Mosqueda.,32,,
187,0.97,1702.6,1709.307,"Clarifying on the last question I asked, does that mean there will be a substitute on how the $5 does not get past on?",33,,
188,0.97,1709.307,1718.049,I was not quite clear with the language and then the intent that Councilmember Herbold talked about.,33,,
189,0.97,1718.049,1729.728,Is there still work being done on that aspect to prevent that from being passed on and prohibiting legislation or just discouraging?,33,,
190,0.97,1729.728,1731.463,There or two pieces.,34,,
191,0.97,1731.463,1736.234,I have been working on a substitute bill so I would have to look to see if it was in the bill Uploaded Friday.,34,,
192,0.97,1736.234,1751.783,There is intended to be or there already is language in the section that prohibits passing on the charge to the customer and it is also in the recitals as well.,34,,
193,0.97,1751.783,1773.872,"It is a prohibition on modifying service to different areas of the city which is also requested in the Mayor's emergency order, capping delivery Commission fees and then there is the prohibition on reducing the compensation paid as a result of the legislation and adding charges or passing on charges to customers.",34,,
194,0.97,1773.872,1791.456,So what the provisions are seeking to do is have current compensation and current charges to customers remaining the same and have the premium pay layered on top of that as the company would pay for the gig workers.,34,,
195,0.97,1791.456,1793.858,Follow-up question.,35,,
196,0.97,1793.858,1802.934,Please.,36,,
197,0.97,1802.934,1815.747,Can you talk about how much Rulemaking is left to the office of labor standards and what the process or Timeline is anticipated to be given the nature of this?,37,,
198,0.97,1815.747,1840.205,This legislation has incorporated a number of drafting techniques and drafting language in order to make the Rulemaking work by office of labor standards lighter and faster than typical labor standards.,38,,
199,0.97,1840.205,1842.707,So director rules are able to be issued their guidance via the question and answer document.,38,,
200,0.97,1842.707,1859.29,"And there also is--any time there is reference to director rules instead of conditioning the implementation of the legislation on rules, the rules are discretionary.",38,,
201,0.97,1859.29,1860.892,So Ols has the authority to issue rules but is not required to issue rules.,38,,
202,0.97,1860.892,1897.061,"And there is a provision that says that if Ols or an investigation does not get sufficient records from a respondent or maybe gets so many records that are not organized well enough to quickly go through them, that they are not able to quickly determine how much is owed to the worker or if there was a violation to begin with and they can designate a daily amount of compensation which would be an automatic amount of compensation in Leiu of determining a precise amount.",38,,
203,0.97,1897.061,1926.557,"And so those measures are intended to make enforcement easier come along with that notification and transparency requirement that the hiring entities must itemize each time a worker is paid and which workers qualify for the premium pay . all of those things are intended to help workers . This is intended to be voted on next week, next Monday and it would go into effect immediately.",38,,
204,0.97,1926.557,1931.963,Does require a 3/4 vote of counsel.,38,,
205,0.97,1931.963,1940.271,Last question.,39,,
206,0.97,1940.271,1944.075,I did some grocery shopping this weekend and I was asked three times at the store if I was Instacart.,39,,
207,0.97,1944.075,1951.883,"Finally I asked the third person, what is the reasoning folks are asking that?",39,,
208,0.97,1951.883,1954.786,"They said, because you are buying a lot of groceries.",39,,
209,0.97,1954.786,1964.862,I guess I'm wondering how often folks are doing large Pickups and multiple stops.,39,,
210,0.97,1964.862,1965.43,You have any sense.,39,,
211,0.97,1965.43,1980.712,You mentioned the four stops in Seattle . do we know how often the orders contain multiple pickup points or multiple drop off points?,39,,
212,0.97,1980.712,1987.585,It is not information that I have but perhaps it is something Councilmember Herbold or Louis know more about.,40,,
213,0.97,1987.585,1990.254,I don't have an information.,41,,
214,0.97,1990.254,2004.001,"And our conversations with Instacart and post mates, a lot of the questions we had, we received a response that the information was proprietary.",41,,
215,0.97,2004.001,2013.611,I do get an openness to answer some specific questions related to this particular piece of legislation.,41,,
216,0.97,2013.611,2028.359,"So I'm happy to share that question on your behalf, Councilmember Mosqueda, with those two Stakeholders.",41,,
217,0.97,2028.359,2037.702,I will add that the legislation was drafted in such a way to cover the full range of situations that might happen . so that stuck order was contemplated in the draft.,42,,
218,0.97,2037.702,2048.079,"Also the language at least in the forthcoming substitute bill, talks about any additional stops that may result from the Online order.",42,,
219,0.97,2048.079,2075.106,"So perhaps if there are two rioters in a vehicle where one person is paying the bill but then they ask for a separate drop off point or something happens that results in a separate drop of order, legislation is written in such a way to incur the charge even if it wasn't initially in the Online order.",42,,
220,0.97,2075.106,2085.283,"Colleagues, any other questions or comments?",43,,
221,0.97,2085.283,2085.85,Looks like there are none.,43,,
222,0.97,2085.85,2097.462,"Colleagues, this is a reminder that the sponsor Timeline is to provide any information related to amendments on May 28th by noon.",43,,
223,0.97,2097.462,2102.2,So that is and a couple of days here.,43,,
224,0.97,2102.2,2114.912,"And we intend to, if all goes well, to allow for consideration of this bill on June 1ST of 2020 at the 2 P.M.",43,,
225,0.97,2114.912,2115.413,Full council meeting.,43,,
226,0.97,2115.413,2139.303,Obviously Karina is available to Council members are interested in making amendments or want to know more about the legislation and the sponsors I'm sure are also equally happy to speak with each of you individually about any ongoing questions or concerns that you might have or additional information you might need.,43,,
227,0.97,2139.303,2141.739,"So thank you, Karina, for being with us this morning and for that presentation.",43,,
228,0.97,2141.739,2150.715,We were going to go ahead and move along in the agenda.,43,,
229,0.97,2150.715,2153.651,The next agenda item is beginning the discussion of the city council action.,43,,
230,0.97,2153.651,2160.191,Council and regional committees and any other information Council members would like to share.,43,,
231,0.97,2160.191,2168.065,We will again go in the rollcall order.,43,,
232,0.97,2168.065,2180.745,"And the rollcall order today is Councilmember Lewis, Morales, Mosqueda, Pedersen, Strauss, Lewis and then I will conclude that section.",43,,
233,0.97,2180.745,2181.512,Let's go ahead and get started.,43,,
234,0.97,2181.512,2187.685,First is Councilmember Lewis.,43,,
235,0.97,2187.685,2188.052,Place to.,43,,
236,0.97,2188.052,2189.921,"Thank you Madam, president.",44,,
237,0.97,2189.921,2190.721,Not a lot to cover this morning.,44,,
238,0.97,2190.721,2196.427,A lot of the update was worked into the presentation just now on the premium pay legislation.,44,,
239,0.97,2196.427,2214.345,And I want to echo the comments made by a Council President as well as Karina and others that folks can reach out to me if they have anymore questions or want to talk about potential amendments amendments.,44,,
240,0.97,2214.345,2221.652,I definitely want to have an open process and work with all of you to make a strong and lasting ordinance.,44,,
241,0.97,2221.652,2222.653,Please do not hesitate to reach out.,44,,
242,0.97,2222.653,2240.071,"On Wednesday the 27th this week, the select Committee on homelessness and investments will meet and discuss Councilmember Morales counsel bill 119716 related to the navigation team.",44,,
243,0.97,2240.071,2241.539,"And just to remind everybody, it is the committee as a whole.",44,,
244,0.97,2241.539,2249.313,"If folks can make sure that they plan on attending that and make sure we have a Quorum, that would be great.",44,,
245,0.97,2249.313,2254.685,Should be a discussion.,44,,
246,0.97,2254.685,2272.103,I'm working with Jacob Thorne on my staff to make sure we put together good and discuss this with members of the community and folks that will be coming down from the executive's office to talk about the city's homeless response more broadly.,44,,
247,0.97,2272.103,2299.43,"And I look forward to being able to have that exchange and have a discussion, not just about 119796 but also how we can get more neighbors experiencing homelessness off the street and inside and in a safe place to practice social distancing and be part of the public health response here in the city.",44,,
248,0.97,2299.43,2309.54,"On Thursday may 28th, the queen and farmer's market is going to be opening again for another season.",44,,
249,0.97,2309.54,2330.661,"Really, proud of the work my office did working with queen and farmer's market to maintain the critical sense of continuity during these really difficult times where so many of our festivals, traditions and farmers markets are being postponed and delayed and in some cases might not be coming back.",44,,
250,0.97,2330.661,2342.873,"I think it will be really good to see the farmer's market, which is the Premier independent farmer's market in the city of Seattle, coming back to the community on Thursday afternoons.",44,,
251,0.97,2342.873,2349.947,I encourage folks watching at home to head over to the farmer's market and get some vegetables and cheese.,44,,
252,0.97,2349.947,2352.016,I will be there for the opening and wearing a mask.,44,,
253,0.97,2352.016,2361.092,And hoping you will be there as well.,44,,
254,0.97,2361.092,2374.705,That is really good to know that that is opening up again and joining so many of the other neighborhood farmers that are open and doing their best to adapt to the difficult environment.,44,,
255,0.97,2374.705,2384.482,We had another really good round of office hours last week meeting with a variety of constituents across the district.,44,,
256,0.97,2384.482,2387.852,I want to plug in the office hours one more time.,44,,
257,0.97,2387.852,2392.523,And I still on a weekly basis have that opportunity to meet.,44,,
258,0.97,2392.523,2399.296,I believe making that known publicly has boosted it.,44,,
259,0.97,2399.296,2402.533,"The last two weeks, they have been completely full.",44,,
260,0.97,2402.533,2415.413,I encourage members of the public to take advantage of that on my Website and sign up for those slots and make your concerns known so that I can be a better advocate for all the people of district seven here on the city council.,44,,
261,0.97,2415.413,2422.887,"With that, Madam, president, I don't have any additional updates and I look forward to hearing from everybody else.",44,,
262,0.97,2422.887,2427.658,Thank you so much Councilmember Lewis.,45,,
263,0.97,2427.658,2435.666,Any questions or comments for Councilmember Lewis?,45,,
264,0.97,2435.666,2438.335,"Hearing and seeing none, thank you again.",45,,
265,0.97,2438.335,2439.603,Looking forward to your community meeting on Wednesday.,45,,
266,0.97,2439.603,2451.115,"I will just note that again, I will read or right reiterate for that meeting to occur.",45,,
267,0.97,2451.115,2455.653,That means five of us need to be present.,45,,
268,0.97,2455.653,2467.364,"Councilmember Lewis, and the work you are doing to prepare for Wednesday, if you end of having difficulty establishing Quorum, let my office know as quickly as possible and we will try to help out where we can.",45,,
269,0.97,2467.364,2468.399,Help you so much.,45,,
270,0.97,2468.399,2475.339,Next is Councilmember Morales.,45,,
271,0.97,2475.339,2476.607,Good morning everyone.,46,,
272,0.97,2476.607,2481.011,I hope everybody got to have a little bit of rest over the holiday weekend.,46,,
273,0.97,2481.011,2492.223,"Tomorrow, we have nothing on the calendar this afternoon but we do have two hearings tomorrow or meetings tomorrow.",46,,
274,0.97,2492.223,2502.533,"In my community economic development Committee, we will have a hearing . and that will be open to the public.",46,,
275,0.97,2502.533,2516.347,We will be taking comments from folks and hearing from counsel central staff and we have several amendments being considered there.,46,,
276,0.97,2516.347,2535.499,"Additionally, whereas Councilmember Lewis mentioned, we have the Committee on homelessness, investment strategies, where we will be talking about the bill that our office has proposed to limit encampment Removals during the Covid-19 epidemic.",46,,
277,0.97,2535.499,2547.444,I will say that I went last week to the end him and removal on King street last Wednesday where we had several conversations with people who had been moved.,46,,
278,0.97,2547.444,2558.656,And it was a hard morning to be talking with people who have been traumatized and moved repeatedly as they try to find some sort of stability.,46,,
279,0.97,2558.656,2567.064,One person I spoke with had been removed several times.,46,,
280,0.97,2567.064,2569.867,"And really, was not interested in going into a Congregant shelter.",46,,
281,0.97,2569.867,2570.601,He was afraid of doing that.,46,,
282,0.97,2570.601,2585.549,"Especially because of Covid-19 and was eager for the chance to get into a stable situation . When I asked what he had been offered, he said nothing.",46,,
283,0.97,2585.549,2590.387,And that the reached workers had come by and had taken his information.,46,,
284,0.97,2590.387,2609.073,But they do that every time he is moved and he has been asking to go into a tiny home village for two years but has not been able to get in . and he would be eager to get into a hotel room or some individual unit that would allow him to be safe during this epidemic.,46,,
285,0.97,2609.073,2620.884,I think there are a lot of folks who really are not interested in being moved from neighborhood to neighborhood.,46,,
286,0.97,2620.884,2634.264,"Our neighbors don't want people moved, especially if they are at risk of infection . I'm looking forward to the conversation tomorrow and to the discussion we will be having.",46,,
287,0.97,2634.264,2643.841,"I will say also that in the last week, we have had I think four conversations with folks from the Chinatown International district.",46,,
288,0.97,2643.841,2645.009,Folks are frustrated and that is understandable.,46,,
289,0.97,2645.009,2670.834,We also have been listening to service providers to hear about their work and really want to have a conversation tomorrow that allows us to understand the reality of what our shelter situation is and what the availability is and what options we have to be protecting people during this pandemic.,46,,
290,0.97,2670.834,2674.972,Protecting the communities and protecting the people who are the most vulnerable.,46,,
291,0.97,2674.972,2679.977,The folks living on the streets right now.,46,,
292,0.97,2679.977,2691.121,I'm eager for that conversation and I hope that all of you will be able to join us and move that conversation forward.,46,,
293,0.97,2691.121,2692.189,We did not have office hours last week.,46,,
294,0.97,2692.189,2704.034,"This week, we will be talking with folks again Friday and that is really all I have for this morning.",46,,
295,0.97,2704.034,2706.904,Thank you.,46,,
296,0.97,2706.904,2707.738,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,47,,
297,0.97,2707.738,2715.512,Any questions or comments on that report?,47,,
298,0.97,2715.512,2717.748,Councilmember Herbold and Lewis were like a race.,47,,
299,0.97,2717.748,2724.655,Thank you.,48,,
300,0.97,2724.655,2729.56,I get to go first I guess.,48,,
301,0.97,2729.56,2731.495,"Councilmember Morales, thank you for the update.",48,,
302,0.97,2731.495,2735.499,I forgot to mention that last week I did participate along with Councilmembers Herbold and Mosqueda.,48,,
303,0.97,2735.499,2737.868,It feels like a month ago.,48,,
304,0.97,2737.868,2747.311,Cove it weeks are like dog years with Covid-19.,48,,
305,0.97,2747.311,2762.693,And focusing on the ultimate goal of Scaling up housing placements with 6500 placements over five years or some kind of regional partnership between governments and the private sector.,48,,
306,0.97,2762.693,2767.631,We all hope to share and know the goal.,48,,
307,0.97,2767.631,2782.246,"I just wanted to bring it up to highlight and put into my director to Councilmember Morales, was that I appreciate you bringing up the gentleman you talked to who indicated he wants to get into a tiny home village.",48,,
308,0.97,2782.246,2806.637,"I think that is important because what we have scene is even though the tiny home villages are, to an extent, because I congregate, Lehi has done a really good job at maintaining really sound public health in the villages.",48,,
309,0.97,2806.637,2809.206,There has not been a confirmed Covid-19 case in a tiny House village.,48,,
310,0.97,2809.206,2814.912,I bring that up because I know the tiny House villages are very affordable.,48,,
311,0.97,2814.912,2820.317,And they can also be scaled up quickly.,48,,
312,0.97,2820.317,2837.968,"And while I continue to be a big fan of how telling as many of us on the Council are, one thing I think we could explore more as a counsel--and I want to flag this because I know we have several folks that was into the briefings too.",48,,
313,0.97,2837.968,2839.57,"Increasingly, I think tiny House villages could be part of the response.",48,,
314,0.97,2839.57,2856.086,"I know early going into Lockdown, the executive did scale up quickly and the investments the Council made in the fall for a new tiny House village in North Seattle and then there is a new one at Cherry Hill.",48,,
315,0.97,2856.086,2857.187,Extension of South Lake Union.,48,,
316,0.97,2857.187,2878.675,"If we can build on that and find more resources to expand, I think that could be a critical part of the response, just given that they have proven in this Covid-19 area to be very effective and we know they are very desirable.",48,,
317,0.97,2878.675,2880.477,Many doing their best to get off the street and work with us halfway.,48,,
318,0.97,2880.477,2892.322,But we need to have good placement that is agreeable to them and tiny House villages I think are a good strategy to explore that.,48,,
319,0.97,2892.322,2899.93,"I just wanted to flag that and appreciate you raising that, Councilmember Morales.",48,,
320,0.97,2899.93,2900.764,Cannot respond?,49,,
321,0.97,2900.764,2902.065,Of course it.,50,,
322,0.97,2902.065,2902.866,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,51,,
323,0.97,2902.866,2908.272,"We just passed earlier in the year, legislation to allow for more villages.",51,,
324,0.97,2908.272,2917.247,I do think that that is one option that we need to look at.,51,,
325,0.97,2917.247,2933.63,"And knowing we are talking about supporting folks that are chronically homeless, by definition, that means people with high behavioral needs or who are the hardest to serve from social service and social provision perspective perspective.",51,,
326,0.97,2933.63,2936.733,So I do think it is important for us to keep that component of this in mind too.,51,,
327,0.97,2936.733,2953.083,"If we are talking about that particular population, it is both a public health crisis we are dealing with in terms of the local pandemic and the fact that these folks already are in dire need of intensive social services, many of them.",51,,
328,0.97,2953.083,2963.894,And so there is a lot and we are looking forward to having the conversation about what the best approach is for us going forward.,51,,
329,0.97,2963.894,2968.699,Thank you so much.,52,,
330,0.97,2968.699,2969.933,Councilmember Herbold.,52,,
331,0.97,2969.933,2999.629,I want to just flag that I had a conversation over the weekend with senior deputy Mayor about my interest in an ongoing continuous reform in the area of encampment Removals in such a way that we can ensure that the Removals are used in rare circumstances when health and safety is at risk.,53,,
332,0.97,2999.629,3013.71,And my interest in moving toward a place where we are working with Encampments to mitigate concerns instead of always responding with the blunt tool of removing the entire community.,53,,
333,0.97,3013.71,3039.403,"In that conversation, I flagged two--to the deputy Mayor, specific interest related to the Covid-19 crisis and the Council's concerns that the city has not been acting in concert with the CDC recommendations regarding encampment Removals.",53,,
334,0.97,3039.403,3053.917,"In previous conversations with the executive about this issue, the executive has indicated for instance the removal.",53,,
335,0.97,3053.917,3072.135,"There was a Seattle times article that suggested that the city did not consult with public health on the removal, nonetheless the executive set that public health agreed with the city assessment about the encampment Removals.",53,,
336,0.97,3072.135,3082.846,I also heard Murmurings that public health was consulted on the Removals last week.,53,,
337,0.97,3082.846,3118.548,"I indicated that my interest over the weekend that in the relationship with King County public health, where they do an assessment, they confirm for the city and the navigation team that a removal is consistent with Covid-19 related best practices and we formalize that engagement with King County public health and that that should be something we consider doing regardless of whether or not the legislation is enacted.",53,,
338,0.97,3118.548,3126.256,I think there was an openness to talking about that Pathway forward.,53,,
339,0.97,3126.256,3174.671,"I also signaled my interest in addressing one of the issues raised in the deputy's letter to counsel last week related and asked for some language for the legislation to move forward to address concerns around public safety and concerns that if the legislation moves forward, they will not have the ability to do Removals that are sparked by serious public safety concerns, either related to Corona activity happening inside the encampment or fire hazards.",53,,
340,0.97,3174.671,3176.84,I made a request for language I can offer as an amendment there as well.,53,,
341,0.97,3176.84,3182.012,I just wanted to flag that for my colleagues.,53,,
342,0.97,3182.012,3184.514,Thank you.,53,,
343,0.97,3184.514,3199.629,"Thank you Councilmember Herbold, for giving us that preview of what I suspect will be further discussed during Wednesday's select Committee on the homeless and investment strategies.",54,,
344,0.97,3199.629,3212.509,Any other questions or comments from my colleagues as he goes through the rest of the report?,54,,
345,0.97,3212.509,3223.219,"Hearing none, Councilmember Lewis, I noticed in your remarks that you were talking to the executive side about being available for presentation during the community meeting.",54,,
346,0.97,3223.219,3230.126,Can you talk more about where you are in terms of those conversations with the executive?,54,,
347,0.97,3230.126,3263.493,I do think it is important for them to be available to Councilmembers for questions and answers and it would be my strong preference for somebody to be there for my questions live about the legislation and some of the concerns they stated that they had.,54,,
348,0.97,3263.493,3265.695,That is one question.,54,,
349,0.97,3265.695,3279.709,"Secondly, with regard to the Presenters as well, have you had any conversations with anyone from Seattle King County public health in terms of their willingness to participate in your Committee meeting on Wednesday afternoon .?",54,,
350,0.97,3279.709,3282.612,"Thank you for the questions, Councilmember.",55,,
351,0.97,3282.612,3298.128,I need to have a meeting with my community coordinator Jacob Thorpe.,55,,
352,0.97,3298.128,3300.297,With having had the long weekend and the finalizing panelists day.,55,,
353,0.97,3300.297,3320.45,I think we will have definitely the deputy Mayor present . and it is possible he will have chief Scoggins wanting to come to the hearing as well.,55,,
354,0.97,3320.45,3323.853,I continue to want to have somebody from King County public health.,55,,
355,0.97,3323.853,3329.259,I think we are working on who exactly that will be at this current time.,55,,
356,0.97,3329.259,3349.179,"Today, we will definitely be finalizing the executive side panelists and we will let everybody know as soon as everything is confirmed, who they will be so folks can prepare questioning adequately.",55,,
357,0.97,3349.179,3349.512,Great.,56,,
358,0.97,3349.512,3367.23,"As soon as you can give us an update on who we can expect to be at the table presentations, that would be helpful.",56,,
359,0.97,3367.564,3375.472,I know we have a couple of hours slated to be together.,56,,
360,0.97,3375.472,3376.94,I would not be surprised if we end of going more than two hours.,56,,
361,0.97,3376.94,3389.953,I just want to make sure that we have the benefit of knowing exactly who will be at the table so I can Curate my questions and lines of inquiry accordingly.,56,,
362,0.97,3389.953,3391.621,So we appreciate your work with that.,56,,
363,0.97,3391.621,3406.102,"And if you can let us know, that would be preferable later today.",56,,
364,0.97,3406.102,3407.904,Any other questions or comments on this subject matter?,56,,
365,0.97,3407.904,3412.242,We are going to move on through the report.,56,,
366,0.97,3412.242,3412.909,Next is Councilmember Mosqueda.,56,,
367,0.97,3412.909,3415.545,"Thank you Madam, president.",57,,
368,0.97,3415.545,3424.354,I first have a report from Councilmember Juarez.,57,,
369,0.97,3424.354,3427.39,Councilmember Juarez is not with us today but she provided the following updates.,57,,
370,0.97,3427.39,3452.215,First she wanted to send her thanks to her colleagues for signing on to the letter which asked the governor to demand security checkpoints used to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 novel Coronavirus be taken down due to the potential interruptions.,57,,
371,0.97,3452.215,3461.591,Unfortunately she called for President Trump to help her take the infection prevention measure down.,57,,
372,0.97,3461.591,3468.431,The governor's decisions consistently move toward putting thousands of lives at risk and are more vulnerable to put more people vulnerable to the disease.,57,,
373,0.97,3468.431,3471.367,That is why the letter was so important.,57,,
374,0.97,3471.367,3476.673,This is a serious message that shows how we must respect and recognize tribal sovereignty.,57,,
375,0.97,3476.673,3491.888,The Councilmember also wanted to relay that the Sioux tribal message gratitude for sending this message in solidarity publicly.,57,,
376,0.97,3491.888,3495.692,So thanking us publicly for sending the letter.,57,,
377,0.97,3495.692,3505.235,The Councilmember's' office an E- mail last Friday including the thank you letter provided by the Cheyenne River student travel counsel as well.,57,,
378,0.97,3505.235,3512.375,"As far as Panc legislation, there are no items this afternoon on the city council agenda.",57,,
379,0.97,3512.375,3524.22,"In terms of parks weekly to report, Councilmember Juarez office will have updates when they are available after the long Memorial weekend.",57,,
380,0.97,3524.22,3525.588,And she wanted to provide the update from last week's report.,57,,
381,0.97,3525.588,3537.867,Last week Councilmember Juarez taped an episode.,57,,
382,0.97,3537.867,3542.138,Councilmember Juarez took a tour of the arena construction project at the Seattle center.,57,,
383,0.97,3542.138,3555.485,A big thank you too will be G for providing a safety guided tour to show how the project is progressing and how the engineers and construction workers adjusted work plans due to Covid-19 without serious delays.,57,,
384,0.97,3555.485,3556.552,That is from Councilmember Juarez.,57,,
385,0.97,3556.552,3565.929,"Moving O to my report, there are no items from the Finance and housing or the budget Committee on the state Council agenda.",58,,
386,0.97,3565.929,3566.663,I also want to say thank you.,58,,
387,0.97,3566.663,3571.935,I participated in last week's press conference on the third door announcement.,58,,
388,0.97,3571.935,3588.151,I greatly appreciate that homeless advocates for coming together and asking for this collaborative approach to outlining the problem which is hundreds of thousands of housing units we need to bring Online.,58,,
389,0.97,3588.151,3594.924,Specifically 6500 permits in the very near term.,58,,
390,0.97,3594.924,3597.093,Also outlining the funding crisis this demands.,58,,
391,0.97,3597.093,3606.035,"And at the same time, the government alone cannot do this.",58,,
392,0.97,3606.035,3611.541,I think it is a great example of a partnership which means both business academics and community advocates.,58,,
393,0.97,3611.541,3616.145,We are looking forward to them getting the next steps and recognizing that this is still a call for us.,58,,
394,0.97,3616.145,3624.12,To respond in kind with additional local revenue as we see the crisis continue to grow.,58,,
395,0.97,3624.12,3632.662,Last week I also held the economic forum on Tuesday last week.,58,,
396,0.97,3632.662,3634.864,The future national and local experts.,58,,
397,0.97,3634.864,3644.874,The form highlighted the need for spending and supporting public services and small businesses and the community members to show how we can recover stronger and quicker due to the crisis.,58,,
398,0.97,3644.874,3656.486,"As we think about recovering, to make sure we are not just recovering and getting back to normal but that it is creating a new sense of normal and it creates a more inclusive commodity.",58,,
399,0.97,3656.486,3657.153,That will be at 9:00 A.M.,58,,
400,0.97,3657.153,3657.453,Thursday.,58,,
401,0.97,3657.453,3665.495,Will push out information on the social media platforms for folks who did not have a chance to view the content yet.,58,,
402,0.97,3665.495,3666.362,It was great to hear from the experts.,58,,
403,0.97,3666.362,3677.874,I want to thank the Councilmembers Sawant and Morales for joining in on the platform and Councilmember Strauss.,58,,
404,0.97,3677.874,3680.61,We hope you had a chance to look at it.,58,,
405,0.97,3680.61,3695.258,The last thing I want to make a quick comment about the form also coming up for tomorrow for Councilmember Lewis committee.,58,,
406,0.97,3695.258,3697.76,Thank you for coordinating and the opportunity to hear about the bill Councilmember Morales introduced.,58,,
407,0.97,3697.76,3701.03,"To have a possible amendment, one or two possible amendments that were sent last night.",58,,
408,0.97,3701.03,3716.412,There was a memo that was shared that when around to all of the Council colleagues featuring the content of the two possible amendments I would like to introduce to better mirror the CDC guidance.,58,,
409,0.97,3716.412,3731.327,"My hope is to ensure that we are providing an opportunity for the CDC guidance to be applied before any posting of the removal . We know that once those go up, people disperse into the community.",58,,
410,0.97,3731.327,3750.446,"Especially during the time of Covid-19, we want to make sure we are preventing folks from dispersing into the community if they have signs or symptoms of Covid-19 or which could put them at greater risk from spreading or moving into other parts of the city if there are other areas of Covid-19 that they moved to.",58,,
411,0.97,3750.446,3772.635,"As a reminder, there is a link on the memo on page 3 to the interim guidance from the unsheltered homelessness of the Coronavirus disease 2019 list of measures that homeless service providers and local officials are asked to take into account from the CDC.",58,,
412,0.97,3772.635,3773.87,Councilmember Herbold mentioned this in her comments.,58,,
413,0.97,3773.87,3782.011,I wanted to provide a quick summary.,58,,
414,0.97,3782.011,3794.557,The CDC has advised that the risk associated with sleeping outdoors or in an encampment setting are different from the risks of staying indoors in a Congregant setting because outdoor settings may better accommodate increased physical distancing.,58,,
415,0.97,3794.557,3807.837,So that is really the reason that I think folks are raising concerns about potential dismantling of Encampments outside to be moving folks and to conquer get shelters.,58,,
416,0.97,3807.837,3813.342,I understand not all the beds that were offered in the last two or three Removals were Conger get shelters.,58,,
417,0.97,3813.342,3814.71,Some were tiny homes.,58,,
418,0.97,3814.71,3828.257,But the CDC guidance acknowledges the public health concerns are being in a shelter are definitely going to the outside and inside and we need to balance the risk needed to be considered within the context of the Covid-19 spread of the transmission.,58,,
419,0.97,3828.257,3843.306,"In order to prevent the transmission of Covid-19 throughout the general publishing and avoid increasing risk, the CDC guidelines suggest for people living in Encampments that the following guidance should be considered first.",58,,
420,0.97,3843.306,3850.213,"If individual housing options are not available, then allow people living in shelters or in Encampments to remain where they are.",58,,
421,0.97,3850.213,3852.148,This is from the CDC.,58,,
422,0.97,3852.148,3862.525,It goes on to say that Encampments being cleared can cause people to disperse into the community and break connections with service providers.,58,,
423,0.97,3862.525,3864.46,This increases the potential for infectious disease spread.,58,,
424,0.97,3864.46,3865.561,That is from the CDC.,58,,
425,0.97,3865.561,3876.706,"It then goes on to say that if folks are being allowed to stay outside, we must encourage those Encampments to set up the sleeping quarters within a 12-Foot space per individual.",58,,
426,0.97,3876.706,3890.686,"And to make sure people, if they are remaining where they are, that they have a link to service providers and those at risk for severe illness get individual rooms or safe shelters.",58,,
427,0.97,3890.686,3900.696,So it is in that context that I want to draw your attention to the memo that was sent yesterday that has the two amendments that we would potentially discuss tomorrow with the chair's blessing.,58,,
428,0.97,3900.696,3930.259,"And it is an attempt to make sure that I was clear on what I thought the legislative intent was, which would be to make sure we are not preventing outright any Removals period but that it clarifies that if the reason for the end Kimmitt removal is the presence of a Communicable disease including Covid-19 and certain actions have been taken, then the relocation can go forward.",58,,
429,0.97,3930.259,3940.87,"But the prior actions would need to be, as Councilmember Herbold talked about, coordination with public health and getting folks into individual rooms and other strategies being deployed.",58,,
430,0.97,3940.87,3944.573,"If there is an effort to do this administratively, that is great.",58,,
431,0.97,3944.573,3955.084,"If the legislation does not move forward, I think it is critical that we have clarification that these public health strategies have been deployed.",58,,
432,0.97,3955.084,3958.087,And then we can't accommodate individual rooms.,58,,
433,0.97,3958.087,3973.369,And we do everything we can to follow CDC guidance which is to make sure folks have a 12 by 12 space and we are able to move folks off of the Ada accessible walkways and we are doing what we can to make a safe place for individuals in the neighborhood.,58,,
434,0.97,3973.369,3981.978,I think it is important to clarify some of the comments provided to the Seattle times that were inaccurate.,58,,
435,0.97,3981.978,3983.479,That there is nothing in the bill that restricts the navigation team.,58,,
436,0.97,3983.479,3990.119,In the current form of the bill and this is the memo.,58,,
437,0.97,3990.119,3995.091,"There is nothing in the bill that would prohibit the navigation team from responding to criminal, safety, hazards or obstruction.",58,,
438,0.97,3995.091,4023.919,"It says Council member bill 117916 does not restrict housing or other services during Covid-19 and it does not prohibit outright Removals from public safety concerns under the definition of immediate hazard, a safety situation that creates a risk of serious injury or death to others would be allowable for a cause for relocation or removal.",58,,
439,0.97,4023.919,4027.39,I think tomorrow will be very helpful as Councilmember Lewis the chair is setting up the panels.,58,,
440,0.97,4027.39,4037.333,I think it will offer us a chance to talk about the intent and if there are other strategies being used to accomplish the goals for public health strategies to be deployed.,58,,
441,0.97,4037.333,4041.07,I know that I am all ears.,58,,
442,0.97,4041.07,4057.92,I do think it will also be a good opportunity to clarify what the original bill did and did not do because some of the Messaging is counter to what we have seen from the central stuff memo that was sent yesterday and I think that clarification is really important.,58,,
443,0.97,4057.92,4064.66,All of us are interested in the health and safety of the entire community including neighbors is surrounding Encampments and those living in Encampments.,58,,
444,0.97,4064.66,4066.595,"And with that, I look forward to tomorrow's presentation.",58,,
445,0.97,4077.64,4078.207,.,58,,
446,0.97,4078.207,4078.541,Okay.,59,,
447,0.97,4078.541,4079.074,Councilmember Mosqueda.,59,,
448,0.97,4079.074,4079.975,I think we heard most of what you said.,59,,
449,0.97,4079.975,4086.048,You are breaking up quite a bit toward the end.,59,,
450,0.97,4086.048,4097.56,"Colleagues, I want to make sure we are not, that we are using our time here this morning to have some high-level conversations.",59,,
451,0.97,4097.56,4103.732,I don't want to turn the Council briefing into a committee hearing.,59,,
452,0.97,4103.732,4122.251,I know that this is a subject of high importance and we will all have an opportunity to have a detailed conversation about the Council bill or any proposed amendments tomorrow during the Committee on homeless investments and strategy.,59,,
453,0.97,4122.251,4132.661,I appreciate that we are getting courtesy flags from all of the Councilmembers who have spoken already about the potential issues coming up during committee tomorrow afternoon.,59,,
454,0.97,4132.661,4145.841,But I want to make sure that we don't slip too much into detail here at Council briefing and effectively have a working session on a singular bill.,59,,
455,0.97,4145.841,4167.129,"With that being said, I will go ahead and do what I usually do which is call for any comments or questions based on reports.",59,,

546,0.97,4813.642,4819.047,The item is the appointment of Andrea shields as the executive director of the public safety civil service Commission.,75,,
547,0.97,4819.047,4824.452,And she has served in an interim capacity since October of last year.,75,,
548,0.97,4824.452,4828.056,She was formally appointed by the two commissions in a joint committee meeting on January 22nd.,75,,
549,0.97,4828.056,4840.836,"Again, it is a joint position . The authority lies with the two commissions themselves.",75,,
550,0.97,4840.836,4842.47,The public safety civil service Commission and the civil service Commission.,75,,
551,0.97,4842.47,4848.176,The commissions conducted a recruitment process and unanimously selected for the letter of appointment.,75,,

559,0.97,4914.976,4928.556,My office has confirmed the appointment as other Commission -Related appointments as the standard of the governor's order 2028.,75,,
560,0.97,4928.556,4946.107,"Just as a bit of background on both commissions, the public safety civil service Commission hears appeals of employees regarding discipline or action, examination and testing and alleged violations of the city charter personnel rules and personal ordinance.",75,,
561,0.97,4946.107,4954.416,The civil service Commission hears similar appeals for Non- public safety personnel and can submit recommendation as to the Mayor and the Council related to the city's personnel system and other duties.,75,,
562,0.97,4954.416,4964.259,Both commissions have three members with the Mayor and the Council both appointing members and the employees electing the third.,75,,
563,0.97,4964.259,4988.516,"This appointment is through January 21st, 2023. and just as a point of information, some folks might recall resolution 31868 regarding Department head appointment processes and this legislation identifies recruitment and selection process for Department heads.",75,,
564,0.97,4988.516,4994.723,This was legislation sponsored by Councilmember Mosqueda a couple of years ago.,75,,
565,0.97,4994.723,4997.892,This legislation does not apply to cases like this one.,75,,
566,0.97,4997.892,5005.8,Legislation applies in cases where the Mayor appoints and the Council CONFIRMS and that is not the situation here.,75,,
567,0.97,5005.8,5013.808,"This is a position, whether the appointing authority lies in the two commissions itself.",75,,
568,0.97,5013.808,5018.179,So providing that as a point of information.,75,,
569,0.97,5018.179,5029.324,"And again, the resolution addresses Department heads and is not considered a department head in that same way.",75,,
570,0.97,5029.324,5034.963,"Other items coming up, there is of course no public safety committee meeting this week.",75,,
571,0.97,5034.963,5037.565,I am holding office hours this Friday between 3:00 P.M.,75,,
572,0.97,5037.565,5043.271,And 6:00 P.M.,75,,
573,0.97,5043.271,5047.709,"Last week, I joined the launch of the third door coalition as we have heard others speak of today.",75,,
574,0.97,5047.709,5059.287,The third door coalition is an effort among Self-Described unlikely allies to tackle chronic homelessness in the region.,75,,
575,0.97,5059.287,5070.198,They are a coalition of business Stakeholders and social service and homeless advocates.,75,,
576,0.97,5070.198,5077.372,They are working to help people who have struggled for the longest time and specifically focused on chronic homelessness.,75,,
577,0.97,5077.372,5084.546,They have a plan with 6500 units of permanent housing in the next five years.,75,,
578,0.97,5084.546,5107.702,"As we all know, housing is well established as the most effective for people and cost effective solutions to chronic homelessness . about 95% of% people that get into the housing state and it regardless of underlying condition such as mental health issues R substance abuse issues.",75,,
579,0.97,5107.702,5115.41,"And one year, the housing cost the same as three days in the hospital or three months and jail.",75,,
580,0.97,5115.41,5128.923,The third door coalition members have identified a plan to reduce the cost of building supportive housing and raising resources necessary to scale across the region.,75,,
581,0.97,5128.923,5142.47,The work recognizes that cities cannot do this alone and they are proposing a Public-Private partnership in order to increase funding to meet this important goal.,75,,
582,0.97,5142.47,5146.941,I also want to flag that I attended the economic forum for counsel number Mosqueda last week.,75,,
583,0.97,5146.941,5147.408,I appreciated.,75,,
584,0.97,5147.408,5158.453,The focus of not slipping into a sturdy budgeting despite the city's revenue shortfalls message.,75,,
585,0.97,5158.453,5181.976,"The message we have learned from previous recessions is that when governments cut essential services and programs, that they invest in individuals and it takes much longer for the economy to recover . The upcoming budget discussions will be difficult but we have to keep in mind lessons from the past and make investments in people and in the economy to spur growth.",75,,
586,0.97,5181.976,5182.777,And we must look for new revenue.,75,,
587,0.97,5182.777,5194.222,I'm heartened that the Portland area voters last week overwhelmingly approved 2.5 billion in new taxes over 10 years to tackle the homelessness crisis.,75,,
588,0.97,5194.222,5195.79,It was a measure taken to the ballot.,75,,
589,0.97,5195.79,5199.46,And the voters of Portland.,75,,
590,0.97,5199.46,5215.376,"And just really also I want to flag that the majority of the business community was behind this measure . The exception I think, as far as organized opposition in the business community was the grocer's.",75,,
591,0.97,5215.376,5216.444,But there was a broad and strong coalition.,75,,
592,0.97,5216.444,5229.624,Similar to what we see with the third door coalition aligned to recognize the problem.,75,,
593,0.97,5229.624,5234.696,And it was passed by 57% of the ballot among voters in three counties.,75,,
594,0.97,5234.696,5242.237,"So 1% income tax to people who make $125,000 annually or couples who earn to hundred thousand dollars combined.",75,,
595,0.97,5242.237,5245.373,And 1% tax on businesses that generate $5 million annually.,75,,
596,0.97,5245.373,5275.503,"So again, looking to learn from our neighboring jurisdictions, as well as looking to learn from history on how to implement policies and budgets that pull us out of--pull us into any economic recovery.",75,,
597,0.97,5275.503,5281.976,"I want to add to the show not we heard from Councilmember Strauss, to the human services Department.",75,,
598,0.97,5281.976,5290.218,Councilmember Strauss Referenced investments and needs associated with aging populations.,75,,
599,0.97,5290.218,5315.443,Folks probably saw last week the Mayor's office announced several million in additional investments focused on food delivery and I really am proud of the human services Department and the work that individual staffers there have been doing to redeploy staff.,75,,
600,0.97,5315.443,5323.751,Everybody from policy advisors to planners to grant monitors.,75,,
601,0.97,5323.751,5337.198,"Redeploying Hst, the human services Department staffed at the front lines from almost the first day of the public health emergency . They are filling a critical gap.",75,,
602,0.97,5337.198,5344.772,And allowing essential services to stay home as many Nonprofits are struggling with short staffing and fewer volunteers and increased operating cost.,75,,
603,0.97,5344.772,5362.523,"Between March 26th and April 25th, human services Department staff covered 242 shifts two different homeless shelters, contributing a total of 723 hours of service.",75,,
604,0.97,5362.523,5367.161,"Since may 6th, as of the end of April, Hst staff shifted from shelter service to food service.",75,,
605,0.97,5367.161,5384.212,"Since May 6, the human services Department staff covered 78 shifts at food distribution sites contribute a support.",75,,
606,0.97,5384.212,5405.233,This is part of the human resource Department talent redeployment where city workers can take on a few hours of work in the community and be compensated just as they are compensated for their you work.,75,,
607,0.97,5405.233,5418.946,And if folks listening in and they don't know about the redeployment Hub I urge you to check it out and find out how you can plug in and help as well.,75,,
608,0.97,5418.946,5448.042,"I've had the great honor of being able to support human services Department staff by attending the food delivery, food distribution center at the West Seattle food Bank and a taking on shifts on Fridays as well as the South Park senior center last Friday to help pack food for delivery to neighbors alongside our city staff.",75,,
609,0.97,5448.042,5454.382,I think it's important that we show support for city staffers during this work.,75,,
610,0.97,5454.382,5455.883,That is all I have.,75,,
611,0.97,5455.883,5456.751,Thank you,75,,
