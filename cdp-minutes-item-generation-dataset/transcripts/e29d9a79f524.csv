360,0.97,1871.903,1873.404,"Great, thank you.",48,,
361,0.97,1873.404,1877.775,"So again, my name is Phillip.",49,,
362,0.97,1877.775,1881.212,I'm the Bia advocate at the office of economic development.,49,,
363,0.97,1881.212,1884.415,I'm part of the only in Seattle business district team.,49,,
364,0.97,1884.415,1893.925,I'll provide a high level overview of our current Bia program along with a technical overview of the Ud Bia proposal.,49,,
365,0.97,1893.925,1902.667,"Currently we have ten bias in Seattle generating $26 million annual Hi, enhanced services and programs.",49,,
366,0.97,1902.667,1909.741,The revenue is collected 100% for the district in partnership with FAS and Oed.,49,,
367,0.97,1909.741,1916.447,They submit monthly reimbursements reviewed by city departments in order to reimburse for services.,49,,
368,0.97,1916.447,1921.786,We currently have as I mentioned ten organizations in Seattle that are identified as Bia districts.,49,,
369,0.97,1921.786,1929.694,You might note that the first it Iteration of the U district Bia was accomplished in 96.,49,,
370,0.97,1929.694,1933.531,Prior to the 2015 formation of a new Bia.,49,,
371,0.97,1933.531,1946.144,"Some of the programs and services that bias are currently Tasked with, you guys have heard, clean and safe, Marketing/Promotion, special events and economic development.",49,,
372,0.97,1946.144,1960.325,"Something to note is that currently of our nine district based organizations, eight of them are currently contracted with a certified homeless outreach specialist nonprofit.",49,,
373,0.97,1960.325,1962.193,Yolanda covered this previously.,49,,
374,0.97,1962.193,1964.862,The Bia formation is community driven.,49,,
375,0.97,1964.862,1969.701,The community must demonstrate 60% of support from rate payers.,49,,
376,0.97,1969.701,1974.939,And the proponents may utilize property values.,49,,
377,0.97,1974.939,1975.373,Square footage.,49,,
378,0.97,1975.373,1979.944,Any reasonable factors related to benefits that might be received.,49,,
379,0.97,1979.944,1985.683,Oed provides support and evaluates the proposal in alignment with city policies.,49,,
380,0.97,1985.683,1991.456,And we also provide a benefit analysis along with a racial equity tool kit.,49,,
381,0.97,1991.456,1998.096,And we complete a five year program evaluation prior to the renewal of a Bia.,49,,
382,0.97,1998.096,2012.276,"For the technical overview of the Udbia reauthorization, as of April 10th, the U district partnership secured 65.39% of support.",49,,
383,0.97,2012.276,2018.75,The University of Washington being a single rate payer representing 38.8% of that support.,49,,
384,0.97,2018.75,2025.723,"Of the 527 petitions that were representative of the property owners in the democratic, 223 were signed.",49,,
385,0.97,2025.723,2039.871,"And below that, just for a comparison sake, if we were to exclude the University's contribution, the average petitions that went out to the property owners averaged around $1,500 for annual services.",49,,
386,0.97,2039.871,2046.811,"And the average signed petitions of the 222 that we got back was about $1,600.",49,,
387,0.97,2046.811,2054.585,That's basically in alignment in terms of the average support petitions along with average petitions that went out to the Generalpopulation.,49,,
388,0.97,2054.585,2067.365,"The Reare newel slated for 12 years and the accessible rate payers are property owners with representation on the board from residents, business tenants, property owners and the University of Washington.",49,,
389,0.97,2067.365,2076.274,Bias have different assessment models dependent upon the District and also what types of services that the community has selected to support.,49,,
390,0.97,2076.274,2090.521,The U district is a property based assessment model so the rates are--have been primarily 25 cents per thousand of property values tracked by the King County assessor's office.,49,,
391,0.97,2090.521,2094.192,This show Yous a quick Snapshot of the different assessment models.,49,,
392,0.97,2094.192,2102.266,Both for the property based bias along with the business based bias that we have in West Seattle.,49,,
393,0.97,2102.266,2113.778,A couple of changes to the proposal for the reauthorization of the U district Bia is a new general cleaning fee across the entire District of 3 cents.,49,,
394,0.97,2113.778,2118.483,In addition to the two additional cleaning zones.,49,,
395,0.97,2118.483,2119.55,Along with the App.,49,,
396,0.97,2119.55,2124.188,"There's a minor U district boundary adjustment, which we'll get into shortly.",49,,
397,0.97,2124.188,2135.433,And then the formula has--we are Grandfathering in assessments with a moderate increase.,49,,
398,0.97,2135.433,2138.903,Previously Mft buildings are receiving a nonprofit discount on the assessment.,49,,
399,0.97,2138.903,2141.539,That's no longer the case.,49,,
400,0.97,2141.539,2148.045,However Nonprofits in other institutions will still receive a nonprofit discount.,49,,
401,0.97,2148.045,2154.352,But Mft buildings will no longer receive that discount in production.,49,,
402,0.97,2154.352,2157.522,Properties are now deemed accessible.,49,,
403,0.97,2157.522,2164.795,Here is the boundary adjustment along both the northeast boundaries along with the Southern end of the campus.,49,,
404,0.97,2164.795,2189.987,"I should note that the primary South end of the campus is primarily University of Washington buildings as well in light of development in many of our commercial districts, we have noticed a trend of increasing property values based on the methodology required by state law for our local County assessors.",49,,
405,0.97,2189.987,2198.129,"Despite what current use might dictate, it's based on best use.",49,,
406,0.97,2198.129,2201.532,They've seen a tremendous increase in land values and land sales.,49,,
407,0.97,2201.532,2213.244,"In order to minimize the increase in Bia assessments, the proposal dictate Naas the assessment moving forward will grandfather in current assessments.",49,,
408,0.97,2213.244,2216.447,Plus a minor increase.,49,,
409,0.97,2216.447,2227.425,Formulas for any new development that comes into the District after renewal is essentially 27.5 cents per thousand of total taxable value.,49,,
410,0.97,2227.425,2232.697,That's an increase from the current established ordinance of 25 cents per thousand.,49,,
411,0.97,2232.697,2235.833,There's a self cleaning fee.,49,,
412,0.97,2235.833,2237.501,On the South end.,49,,
413,0.97,2237.501,2239.103,Indicated in the map here.,49,,
414,0.97,2239.103,2246.844,Along with a North cleaning area of 9 cents for each total square feet.,49,,
415,0.97,2246.844,2253.317,There's a general three cents per lot square footage added to all remaining properties.,49,,
416,0.97,2253.317,2266.664,New development will be added to the assessment roles as they come in during the Bia and we'll utilize the latest King County property values as new developments come Online.,49,,
417,0.97,2266.664,2272.303,Here's an example of a mixed usage building with commercial retail.,49,,
418,0.97,2272.303,2279.377,The current assessment this property owner is paying today is a little over $950.,49,,
419,0.97,2279.377,2286.584,"The proposal renewal for the base assessment is a modest increase to 1,000 dollars.",49,,
420,0.97,2286.584,2287.752,77 and 65 cents.,49,,
421,0.97,2287.752,2289.42,That's taking into consideration.,49,,
422,0.97,2289.42,2302.833,We're taking the current assessment as of today in 2020 and applying a 10% increase along with a CPI cost of inflation.,49,,
423,0.97,2302.833,2311.976,In order to update the property values from 2015 to 2019 t assessment would have gone on to 1800 per year.,49,,
424,0.97,2313.844,2330.594,"An example of an Maft building receiving a nonprofit discount previously because of the way that it work at the King County level, the total test you see is reduced over the life span of the intervention.",49,,
425,0.97,2330.594,2333.564,The assessment was slightly over 24100 therefore.,49,,
426,0.97,2333.564,2343.874,Because these are essentially marketplace housing a small Subset reserved for market Mace housing.,49,,
427,0.97,2343.874,2366.53,"Both the Bia proponents deemed it was probably not competitive Hi fair taking a look at the appraised value of the building, the new assessment, which is comparable to other similar buildings in the District will be about 9,000 dollars annual Hi.",49,,
428,0.97,2366.53,2372.269,Here's another building that is on Uw owned hand that's been leased to a developer.,49,,
429,0.97,2372.269,2376.874,Previously this building was exempt from Bia assessments.,49,,
430,0.97,2376.874,2380.444,That's no longer the case due to the 99 year lease agreement.,49,,
431,0.97,2380.444,2387.351,"And they'll be contributing about 16,000 plus in annual assessments for their complex.",49,,
432,0.97,2387.818,2396.861,And that's the end of my presentation in terms of some of the technical Overviews of the Bia proposal in the U district.,49,,
433,0.97,2399.964,2400.765,.,49,,
434,0.97,2400.765,2405.436,"Great, thank you, Phillip and Yolanda.",50,,
435,0.97,2405.436,2407.204,And director Lee.,50,,
436,0.97,2407.204,2407.571,Let's see.,50,,
437,0.97,2407.571,2415.78,I do want to just state that we did a little bit of smashing together of items one and two.,50,,
438,0.97,2415.78,2425.89,So we covered both the ordinance and legislative process and the overview from Oed.,50,,
439,0.97,2425.89,2434.732,"So colleagues, do you have any questions for our Presenters about what we've heard so far?",50,,
440,0.97,2434.732,2435.466,Yes?,50,,
441,0.97,2435.466,2437.434,Council member Peterson?,50,,
442,0.97,2437.434,2438.235,Please go ahead.,50,,
443,0.97,2438.235,2441.472,"Thank you, thank you for those presentations.",51,,
444,0.97,2441.472,2443.04,That was very helpful.,51,,
445,0.97,2443.04,2451.382,I had a question about the length of term of the new--or this Reauthorized Bia.,51,,
446,0.97,2451.382,2456.12,It would be going from the current five years to a Twelve- year term.,51,,
447,0.97,2456.12,2459.723,And I wanted to know what's the magic behind that number?,51,,
448,0.97,2459.723,2469.233,Why twelve years? because that does seem like a big jump from the current term.,51,,
449,0.97,2469.233,2477.241,"Thank you, council member, so the twelve years was proposed by Bia proponents in the U district.",52,,
450,0.97,2477.241,2480.811,The most recent renewal was Soto.,52,,
451,0.97,2480.811,2484.348,That time span was 10 years from 2018.,52,,
452,0.97,2484.348,2489.753,"Across the U.S., bias are are pretty prevalent.",52,,
453,0.97,2489.753,2493.824,The general best practice is any where from 10 to 25 years.,52,,
454,0.97,2493.824,2497.228,In the U district.,52,,
455,0.97,2497.228,2500.498,The past alliteration was set for five years.,52,,
456,0.97,2500.498,2509.64,"Based on the original proposal in 2015, so again the duration is predicated based on the Bia proponents from the community.",52,,
457,0.97,2509.64,2509.94,Okay.,53,,
458,0.97,2509.94,2513.444,"And chair, may I ask two more questions?",53,,
459,0.97,2513.444,2513.711,Yes.,54,,
460,0.97,2513.711,2514.545,Please.,54,,
461,0.97,2518.182,2519.617,.,54,,
462,0.97,2519.617,2524.388,The 10% increase that's proposed.,55,,
463,0.97,2524.388,2526.79,Could you talk a little bit about that.,55,,
464,0.97,2526.79,2530.16,Is that going into the economic development category.,55,,
465,0.97,2530.16,2537.134,Is that including the prevention of this placement?,55,,
466,0.97,2537.134,2538.569,"Thank you, council member.",56,,
467,0.97,2538.569,2542.473,I think the proponents might be better equipped to answer that.,56,,
468,0.97,2542.473,2546.477,But I do NOTE in your benefit analysis.,56,,
469,0.97,2546.477,2551.181,The economic development work item in the budget increased substantially.,56,,
470,0.97,2551.181,2558.789,Something also to note is primarily most bias property based.,56,,
471,0.97,2558.789,2563.16,Updates all recent property values.,56,,
472,0.97,2563.16,2566.897,Given the best use--that we're seeing in the U district.,56,,
473,0.97,2566.897,2576.273,Most have stayed constant over the past four years the 10% from my understanding was a way to bridge some of the new services outlined in the proposed budget.,56,,
474,0.97,2576.273,2582.479,"Okay, so we'll hear from the proponents then to answer that question I think.",57,,
475,0.97,2582.479,2587.818,So I'll hold my questions until then.,57,,
476,0.97,2587.818,2588.852,Thank you.,57,,
477,0.97,2590.955,2591.221,.,57,,
478,0.97,2591.221,2591.488,Okay.,58,,
479,0.97,2591.488,2601.532,"Colleagues, any other questions for the Presenters? that have gone so far?",58,,
480,0.97,2601.532,2602.132,Very good.,58,,
481,0.97,2602.132,2602.333,Okay.,58,,
482,0.97,2602.333,2613.21,"Seeing none, we will move on to the next agenda item, Lakisha will you please read the third item of business into the record.",58,,
483,0.97,2613.21,2619.283,"University district business improvement area reauthorization proposal, briefing and discussion.",59,,
484,0.97,2620.05,2620.217,.,59,,
485,0.97,2620.217,2627.257,So we are going to hear from the Bia proponents at this point.,60,,
486,0.97,2627.257,2634.131,"So the Presentedders, if you can please introduce yourselves--Presenters, if you can introduce yourselves and begin your presentation.",60,,
487,0.97,2634.131,2642.306,"Good afternoon, I'm Madame chair Morales, and Council members, I'm Marie Ewing the chair of the rate fair board.",61,,
488,0.97,2642.306,2648.479,I'm also the executive director of U heights and a proud rate payer.,61,,
489,0.97,2648.479,2650.28,We also have mark Crawford.,61,,
490,0.97,2650.28,2655.386,Our interim executive director.,61,,
491,0.97,2655.386,2665.229,And Louise the owner of sweet alchemy on the ave and she's also an active Udp board member.,61,,
492,0.97,2665.229,2669.166,I first want to start by thanking you all for taking the time to meet with us today.,61,,
493,0.97,2669.166,2672.403,We know that your workload is particularly crushing right now.,61,,
494,0.97,2672.403,2676.14,And we are very grateful for your time.,61,,
495,0.97,2676.14,2680.811,And making sure that we can continue the important work of the Bia.,61,,
496,0.97,2680.811,2687.618,"As most of you know, the U district is a vibrant neighborhood.",61,,
497,0.97,2687.618,2704.501,"Made of eclectic small businesses, restaurants offering amazing International cuisine, we have our world class educational institution, residents both owners and tenants and a song knit group of Nonprofits--strong knit group of Nonprofits and faith based communities.",61,,
498,0.97,2704.501,2721.719,"We have very real challenges, the reason I'm so involved with the Bia is they're on the front lines of these challenges, being on the ave Monday through Friday, sometimes more, I know the firsthand positive impact that the Bia has had over the last five years.",61,,
499,0.97,2721.719,2726.557,"U heights has over 3,000 children going to school and other programs.",61,,
500,0.97,2726.557,2728.525,And safety is our number one concern.,61,,
501,0.97,2728.525,2735.466,So I want to paint a picture for you of what life was like before the Bia.,61,,
502,0.97,2735.466,2739.703,At least this expanded version.,61,,
503,0.97,2739.703,2751.949,"Back in 2014, I was afraid to walk directly across the street to what is now Joey Mar own by one of our neighbors and his family, it's on the corner of 50th and the ave.",61,,
504,0.97,2751.949,2752.416,South of that.,61,,
505,0.97,2752.416,2753.884,I would have to cross the street.,61,,
506,0.97,2753.884,2757.454,And cross back to my favorite restaurants.,61,,
507,0.97,2757.454,2760.991,Which were Thai Tom and jewel of India that are still open and doing take out.,61,,
508,0.97,2760.991,2767.498,And I had never seen that level of blatant drug dealing in broad daylight before.,61,,
509,0.97,2767.498,2776.84,That same corner went off one night a drug related shooting caused us to go into our first Hock down at U heights.,61,,
510,0.97,2776.84,2780.31,It happened right when parents were dropping kids off outside.,61,,
511,0.97,2780.31,2788.485,It was excruciating to have to lock the doors knowing there were still kids and parents out in the playground at that time.,61,,
512,0.97,2788.485,2797.828,"Thank goodness we were all safe and the victim survived but because of the Bia and the work that we've done, we don't have to worry so much about our safety.",61,,
513,0.97,2797.828,2804.368,The Bia was instrumental in coordinating with the sheriff's Department and SPD to break up that corner.,61,,
514,0.97,2804.368,2809.339,And this is a huge relief to our community.,61,,
515,0.97,2809.339,2821.185,2014 was also the first time I had staff bring me photos of human Excrement that had become a Reoccurring problem not only on our block but throughout the neighborhood.,61,,
516,0.97,2821.185,2828.859,"And actually this morning, I was just Texted a photo of a milk jug filled with urine.",61,,
517,0.97,2828.859,2836.967,"The Bia again is on the front lines, this past April the Bia removed 1,000 bio hazards.",61,,
518,0.97,2836.967,2840.504,This is a 5.5 times increase over last April.,61,,
519,0.97,2840.504,2849.847,"Over the last five years, the Bia has made a huge impact in the daily cleaning and Beautification of the District and there's a noticeable difference.",61,,
520,0.97,2849.847,2858.589,"And as you know, the public health crisis has only been exacerbated by these Covid closures.",61,,
521,0.97,2858.589,2862.893,The Bia also supports our most vulnerable neighbors.,61,,
522,0.97,2862.893,2871.501,"As mentioned during our public comment, David Delgado demonstrates our compassionate response to all our constituents.",61,,
523,0.97,2871.501,2877.407,"David is a full-time social worker who is the eyes, ears, and voice for people living on the streets.",61,,
524,0.97,2877.407,2885.916,He works with folks experiencing addiction and severe mental and physical distress.,61,,
525,0.97,2885.916,2895.058,"He's extremely successful at kicking people with food, housing, employment, and Med Rall resources that are of up most importance right now.",61,,
526,0.97,2895.058,2902.566,Recently I heard a story where he was able to help reunite a missing young person with his Moher across state lines.,61,,
527,0.97,2902.566,2906.536,So he's out there changing lives everyday doing really difficult work.,61,,
528,0.97,2906.536,2911.975,"And because of the Bia, hundreds are getting the individual attention they need to survive.",61,,
529,0.97,2911.975,2926.923,"And another story I'd like to share that just happened last week, was we had expanded our--and extended our security services and one of our workers saved a life by literally getting in the middle of a fight.",61,,
530,0.97,2926.923,2939.036,"And at this point, one of the men was laying unconscious and was continuing to be beaten and our security got in the middle until SPD could arrive.",61,,
531,0.97,2939.036,2943.707,So we're out there literally saving lives everyday.,61,,
532,0.97,2943.707,2956.82,The Bia manages these types of crisis on a daily basis so the rest of us running businesses and Nonprofits can continue to survive during this pandemic.,61,,
533,0.97,2956.82,2961.958,That's a highlight of cheap and safe efforts.,61,,
534,0.97,2961.958,2964.561,And ultimately all are good for small businesses.,61,,
535,0.97,2964.561,2969.433,Small businesses are are all ready operating in a harsh economic climate before Covid.,61,,
536,0.97,2969.433,2989.319,"And as Council member Peterson just mentioned from this report, we know that 65% of our small businesses are Poc owned and now more than ever, it's critical that the Bia continue to give small businesses the tools they need to ward off economic displacement.",61,,
537,0.97,2989.319,3003.333,"At the onset of the pandemic, Udp staff suited up in their Ppe gear and went door to door to provide information about available resources not only available though the Bia but through government resources.",61,,
538,0.97,3003.333,3013.276,"And personally, after we had experienced many layoffs at U heights, one of the first calls I made was to mark who you'll hear from in a minute.",61,,
539,0.97,3013.276,3018.715,"He and his staff set up two Hotlines, one for folks who were recently unemployed.",61,,
540,0.97,3018.715,3021.218,And one for a small business supporter.,61,,
541,0.97,3021.218,3023.687,The Bia was a lifeline when we needed it most.,61,,
542,0.97,3023.687,3028.125,And their one on one support made all the difference at a very scary time.,61,,
543,0.97,3028.125,3035.399,So now I would like to introduce Louise.,61,,
544,0.97,3035.399,3043.473,She's going to give you more insight into her experience with these programs that help prevent economic displacement for small businesses.,61,,

549,0.97,3065.262,3070.033,The work they do to bring together such a diverse community is not easy.,62,,
550,0.97,3070.033,3072.102,We have college student population.,62,,
551,0.97,3072.102,3076.807,Not just from in and around Washington but from around the world living in our district.,62,,

554,0.97,3087.617,3093.023,First generation immigrants have opened up shop here in greater numbers of diversity than any where in the city.,62,,
555,0.97,3093.023,3097.627,We have a robust medical community and homeless community.,62,,
556,0.97,3097.627,3101.298,We're all neighbors and we all show up for cleaning.,62,,
557,0.97,3101.298,3110.44,"As a business owner with a store front on the main strip, Cleanliness of the street has been an ongoing issue.",62,,
558,0.97,3110.44,3118.715,"With the Udp contracts, sweeping constantly, we've seen unpleasant Street activities decrease.",62,,
559,0.97,3118.715,3121.485,"During the lock downs, the cleaning has been crucial.",62,,
560,0.97,3121.485,3134.764,"But the Udp security team ambassadors have stepped up in major ways and play a critical role in keeping our streets safe, as well as being eyes and ears for businesses.",62,,
561,0.97,3134.764,3136.8,A few days ago.,62,,

572,0.97,3222.385,3246.209,"A lot of business owners don't speak English as their first language and with lacking social media presence from these individual businesses, the advocacy that the small business--the advocacy the Udp provides will become much more important in the success and Survivability of our vibrant and diverse community.",62,,
573,0.97,3246.209,3248.545,There's a lot to learn and expand upon.,62,,
574,0.97,3248.545,3258.388,The pandemic put a pivot on marking and community oriented neighborhood projects that I'm personally excited to see continue.,62,,
575,0.97,3258.388,3263.827,Such as making Uw Cherry who's some into a festival for the whole district.,62,,

580,0.97,3287.484,3287.884,"Good, thank you.",63,,
581,0.97,3287.884,3291.454,"Thanks, I want to begin by talking for a moment about community input.",63,,
582,0.97,3291.454,3299.329,"In each of these areas, the boundaries, the terms, the rates, and the Cheaping zone, we tested a range of options with all of our community.",63,,
583,0.97,3299.329,3304.134,We did this by holding open public meetings and events.,63,,
584,0.97,3304.134,3320.45,We did this by reaching out to Stormmode Silverado groups and Ininviting them to meet with us.,63,,
585,0.97,3333.83,3336.333,June 9th 2019 meeting at the annual meeting.,63,,
586,0.97,3336.333,3339.102,Let's talk quickly about the areas themselves.,63,,
587,0.97,3339.102,3340.637,First the boundaries.,63,,
588,0.97,3340.637,3366.896,"We're reducing the size of the geographic Footprint N. the North areas being removed are overwhelmingly single family residential blocks the single family residential areas are not rate payers and they were driven by community input and requests from the residents in the Southern sector, the boundary was moved northward to make it clear no Bia resources expend Richmond the University of Washington campus itself.",63,,
589,0.97,3366.896,3369.232,This has been true since we began.,63,,
590,0.97,3369.232,3373.436,But the current Bia boundary created confusion about that.,63,,
591,0.97,3373.436,3381.544,And we think this Rectifies that confusion two important notes about the rates.,63,,
592,0.97,3381.544,3387.217,The base assessment methodology and the proposed increase in the rate itself.,63,,
593,0.97,3387.217,3414.544,"The proposed Bia assessment is based on our exempt to protect rate payers and tenants from the increases created by values simply put, given the King County assessor's responsibility to value properties at their best and highest use for those owners who are not choosing to Redevelop their properties, they are deed rich but cash poor.",63,,
594,0.97,3414.544,3418.748,"By maintaining the existing base year for each property, we're protecting them.",63,,
595,0.97,3418.748,3427.157,"If they develop their property Inthe future, their base year is updated to more accurately reflect the actual best use at that time.",63,,
596,0.97,3427.157,3439.035,"Second, as was noted by the Oed presentation, the U district Bia had and still has the second lowest rate of all property based bias.",63,,
597,0.97,3439.035,3441.237,10% may sound like a big jump.,63,,
598,0.97,3441.237,3451.214,"But because our current rate is so low, it's actually only an increase of 2 cents .5 cents per $1,000 of accessible value.",63,,
599,0.97,3451.214,3459.088,This increase is being asked in direct response to community input that we expand support of businesses and the over all economic development.,63,,
600,0.97,3459.088,3471.601,"On the cleaning zones, over the past five years, the current Bia has taught us and reinforced over and over and over again that maintaining a clean and safe neighborhood is the foundation for all success.",63,,
601,0.97,3471.601,3475.505,Someone needs to pick up the bio hazards.,63,,
602,0.97,3475.505,3481.744,"The Bio-Waste, remove the graffiti, pick up the trash and remove the garbage.",63,,
603,0.97,3481.744,3491.321,"We'll continue to provide extensive professional Cheaping services in the existing cleaning areas, and now we propose to extend services through the entire district one time a month.",63,,
604,0.97,3491.321,3493.69,"Finally, to talk about the term.",63,,
605,0.97,3493.69,3499.262,The current Bia was deliberate Lisette up for an exceptionally short-term of five years.,63,,
606,0.97,3499.262,3505.902,To provide initial services and to let the community understand the benefits and the outcomes of the Bia.,63,,
607,0.97,3505.902,3513.977,"After five years, over 65% of Rsf base is asking for this renewal.",63,,
608,0.97,3513.977,3515.778,They believe in the Bia.,63,,
609,0.97,3515.778,3521.351,The proposed term is more Choughsly Hey headlined with all other Seattle bias.,63,,
610,0.97,3521.351,3523.853,Ranging from seven years to Perpetuity.,63,,
611,0.97,3523.853,3546.876,"Renewals are difficult consuming processes and they use up precious resources shorter terms him the ability of the Bia to think and plan and operate strategically, they create inefficiencies in program delivery given the local U district conditions the changes and given the community's input, twelve years was identified as the optimum time for next Bia.",63,,
612,0.97,3546.876,3552.015,I'll be glad to respond more to Council member Peterson if there's follow up question for that.,63,,
613,0.97,3552.015,3557.287,So thank you very much.,63,,
614,0.97,3557.287,3557.654,Maureen?,63,,
615,0.97,3557.654,3568.331,"Thanks, mark, we'll wrap it up soon here and open it up for questions but I did want to touch on the Governance model that we already have in place.",64,,
616,0.97,3568.331,3569.766,I it's pretty elaborate.,64,,
617,0.97,3569.766,3573.87,We have several layers of over sight over Bia operations.,64,,
618,0.97,3573.87,3577.04,The rate payer advisory board is at the very top.,64,,
619,0.97,3577.04,3582.378,And it's made up of 80% rate payers with a mix of neighborhood representatives.,64,,
620,0.97,3582.378,3585.381,Every year we vote on three things.,64,,
621,0.97,3585.381,3591.321,"The upcoming year's workman, the budget, as well as who's going to be designated as the program manager.",64,,
622,0.97,3591.321,3599.395,"So we are really at the 30,000- foot level insuring that measurable goals are met in all of our focus areas.",64,,
623,0.97,3599.395,3608.738,"In addition to that, we have 311 rate payers that are are invited to assist a vote annually to improve the same items.",64,,
624,0.97,3608.738,3611.24,Including the program manager.,64,,
625,0.97,3611.24,3614.444,Then recommendations are directed to the city for final approval.,64,,
626,0.97,3614.444,3619.849,Our board members serve Three- year terms and they must be voted back on at the end of their terms.,64,,
627,0.97,3619.849,3622.952,We've had a healthy turn Overrate.,64,,
628,0.97,3622.952,3628.157,Nearly 45% of bringing on new board members over the last five years.,64,,
629,0.97,3628.157,3635.131,"Then going down the chart, we have the Udp board, also made up of a diverse mix of neighborhood representatives.",64,,
630,0.97,3635.131,3638.735,And they provide over sight of the daily operations.,64,,
631,0.97,3638.735,3641.004,So they are really boots on the ground.,64,,
632,0.97,3641.004,3650.113,"Along with that board, we have several committees and our neighborhood has many opportunities to participate and give feedback on our work.",64,,
633,0.97,3650.113,3653.816,That's been funneled up through the two ports.,64,,
634,0.97,3653.816,3659.155,We also do extensive community outreach through multiple channels.,64,,
635,0.97,3659.155,3666.996,"We use social media, mailings, community forums, so we really do our best to try to reach everyone that lives and works in the U district.",64,,
636,0.97,3666.996,3680.977,"And I can attest that it's a tremendous amount of work and a labor of love for our executive director mark, the Lynch pen between all these park groups of folks.",64,,
637,0.97,3680.977,3687.083,The Bia I think what's most powerful for me is that it's really the great commuter in our neighborhood.,64,,
638,0.97,3687.083,3694.624,We all can contribute small amounts to the pie but have such a bigger impact together.,64,,
639,0.97,3694.624,3698.995,And for the first time we're convening across all sectors.,64,,
640,0.97,3698.995,3714.31,And we whole heartedly support the opposed amendment to include language in the ordinance to specifically prevent small business displacement with a particular focus on Poc and women owned businesses.,64,,
641,0.97,3714.31,3721.584,As well as the new proposed requirement to formally increase the required representation of triple net rate payers on our board.,64,,
642,0.97,3721.584,3725.922,We know that our small businesses smart and they're innovative.,64,,
643,0.97,3725.922,3728.891,We see them reinventing themselves through this crisis.,64,,
644,0.97,3728.891,3734.03,And we rely on their insights to drive our mission forward.,64,,
645,0.97,3734.03,3746.909,So we scratched on the surface of the full breadth of Bia services but I hope we were able to give you a Snapshot of what our daily work looks like.,64,,
646,0.97,3746.909,3762.859,Work that is so critical now more than ever the Propoise increase that Council member Peterson talked about will go to driving patrons to businesses.,64,,
647,0.97,3762.859,3766.996,So we can go into greater details when we open it up for Q & amp; a.,64,,
648,0.97,3766.996,3780.209,But I want to impress upon the committee that an interruption in Bia service would be detrimental to the neighborhood and exacerbate the public health crisis we find ourselves in today.,64,,
649,0.97,3780.209,3790.586,Our goal is to ensure existing small businesses are getting support they need to survive now and then thrive when we're able to reopen again.,64,,
650,0.97,3790.586,3794.59,Thank you so much for taking the time during this difficult time for our city.,64,,
651,0.97,3794.59,3802.165,And we're very appreciative that the Council understands the urgency of Reauthorizing the U district Bia.,64,,
652,0.97,3802.165,3804.967,Thank you again.,64,,
653,0.97,3806.869,3814.477,"Thank you, Maureen, and thank you Louise and mark as well for sharing this information with us.",64,,
654,0.97,3814.477,3819.115,"Council, colleagues are are there any questions for Presenters right now?",64,,
655,0.97,3819.115,3823.853,"I should say the next section, we will have sort of an issues identification discussion.",64,,
656,0.97,3823.853,3832.562,"But if you have questions for our Presenters, please let me know.",64,,
657,0.97,3837.4,3842.939,I'm not seeing anything.,64,,
658,0.97,3842.939,3848.678,Okay.,64,,
659,0.97,3848.678,3849.879,In that case.,64,,
660,0.97,3849.879,3850.813,We'll close that.,64,,
661,0.97,3850.813,3854.016,Will you read the last item of business into the record.,64,,
662,0.97,3854.016,3862.758,University district business improvement area issue identification briefing and discussion.,65,,
663,0.97,3862.758,3863.025,Okay.,66,,
664,0.97,3863.025,3866.362,I believe is that Yolanda and Phillip?,66,,
665,0.97,3866.362,3871.701,That will be mostly me and maybe Phillip can Chime in as needed.,67,,
666,0.97,3871.701,3873.469,"Please go ahead, Yolanda.",68,,
667,0.97,3873.469,3882.912,I want to walk through the issue identification that I described in my memo.,69,,
668,0.97,3882.912,3885.114,And speak to some of those points.,69,,
669,0.97,3885.114,3886.315,Regarding rate payer support.,69,,
670,0.97,3886.315,3899.862,This was just more of a kind of thinking about how the Bia proponents collected the petitions.,69,,
671,0.97,3899.862,3900.129,Over 65%.,69,,
672,0.97,3900.129,3901.931,Last year and earlier this year.,69,,
673,0.97,3901.931,3905.735,Prior to the onset of the Covid- 19 pandemic and the current financial crisis.,69,,
674,0.97,3905.735,3916.012,"So we have not, you know, done any formal check back in necessarily as a city to the--those who signed the petitions.",69,,
675,0.97,3916.012,3923.886,And so I just--I'm flagging this for the Council members prior to the public hearing.,69,,
676,0.97,3923.886,3934.864,Because state law States proceedings shall terminate if potential rate payers representing the majority of the total assessment oppose the Bia.,69,,
677,0.97,3934.864,3938.267,So that's something to be aware of.,69,,
678,0.97,3938.267,3944.674,And the next item was in regards to the Bia advisory board.,69,,
679,0.97,3944.674,3952.381,"And as noted by the presentation before, there are a few differences from the current composition of the board.",69,,
680,0.97,3952.381,3957.453,There will be two additional commercial tenants.,69,,
681,0.97,3957.453,3964.16,Specifically those subject to be a triple net lease for a total of three commercial tenant representatives.,69,,
682,0.97,3964.16,3966.395,And an additional residential representative.,69,,
683,0.97,3966.395,3973.102,So there will be one residential tenant and one residential owner instead of one or the other.,69,,
684,0.97,3973.102,3980.509,So that will result in two residential representatives.,69,,
685,0.97,3980.509,3987.817,And the other requirements are are unchanged from the previous advisory board.,69,,
686,0.97,3987.817,3993.689,Specifically the 35% cap on representatives from the University of Washington.,69,,
687,0.97,3993.689,4007.169,And the 80% rate payers with seats dedicated to rate payers with at least one rate payer representing less than .5% of the total assessment.,69,,
688,0.97,4007.169,4021.05,Due to the requirement the board have the form Nonrate payer positions the business and residential tenants and rate payers most hold 80% of the seats the board will have no fewer than 20 members.,69,,
689,0.97,4021.05,4028.324,That make this is a relatively large advisory board for reference the current Bia board I believe has 15 numbers.,69,,
690,0.97,4028.324,4043.472,"And looking at other city advisory boards and other Bia boards that I've been able to see, these bodies typically are more in the 12 to 16 member range.",69,,
691,0.97,4043.472,4045.207,In terms of I think functioning.,69,,
692,0.97,4045.207,4075.137,So some options here are that the committee could elect to amend the legislation to reduce the share of seats reserved for rate payers to something like 75% for example which would Hoer the minimum number to 16 seats .Or make other changes as requested during the public hearing or received other feedback.,69,,
693,0.97,4075.137,4079.141,"And seeing no questions, I will move on to the assessment rates.",69,,
694,0.97,4079.141,4085.815,I think these have been described in great detail by Oed and the proponents.,69,,
695,0.97,4085.815,4090.319,"So again, it's a relatively small increase?",69,,
696,0.97,4090.319,4091.12,The rates.,69,,
697,0.97,4091.12,4119.748,"Though we know that businesses and residents whether owners or tenants are struggling financially right now and this increase in assessments is, you know, likely to be passed on and that's potentially an additional burden.",69,,
698,0.97,4119.748,4129.258,In place for tenants in terms of increases in rent for businesses impacted by Covid-19 as well as small businesses and Nonprofits.,69,,
699,0.97,4129.258,4139.635,I just want to note based on kind of some additional research I did that Bia assessments may--could be bundled into rent.,69,,
700,0.97,4139.635,4164.827,"In which case, a rent increase would--so the increase in the Bia assessments would not necessarily be passed on to the tenant as a result but if the assessments are a separate charge of just based on, you know, how the lease agreement is, then that increase may be passed on to the tenant even while protections are in place.",69,,
701,0.97,4164.827,4167.162,Because it's not considered rent.,69,,
702,0.97,4167.162,4181.477,So I also want to note that--so the Department of finance and administrative services is the Department that is in charge of billing rate payers and collecting the assessments.,69,,
703,0.97,4181.477,4184.38,And engaging with the rate payers on that front.,69,,
704,0.97,4184.38,4193.489,And their practice is to typically send out the first bill 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance.,69,,
705,0.97,4193.489,4212.575,"In this case, I had not mentioned this before, but the current legislation includes a confirm clause which allows some aspects of it to take effect prior to--after Council adoption prior to the effective date.",69,,
706,0.97,4212.575,4226.488,"So in that case, FAS may actually--could actually send out their--the bills earlier than 30 days after the typical effective date of the ordinance.",69,,
707,0.97,4226.488,4229.291,That's just something to be aware of.,69,,
708,0.97,4229.291,4263.692,"And so some options here, if they seem appropriate, would be to amend the Council bill to require FAS to offer rate pay URS Exchewedding University of Washington, a voluntary rate payer, the option to differ payment of assessments or to delay sending out initial assessments until later in the year and you know we want to work with FAS on this option if that was desired.",69,,
709,0.97,4263.692,4270.399,There's the potential that the Council could amend proposed rates for the first couple years.,69,,
710,0.97,4270.399,4273.035,So that--to decrease the rates potentially.,69,,
711,0.97,4273.035,4277.306,So they're kind of more in line with the current rates.,69,,
712,0.97,4277.306,4282.111,So do not reflect that 10% increase.,69,,
713,0.97,4282.111,4285.814,Both of these options could limit the operations.,69,,
714,0.97,4285.814,4290.286,Because then due to the cash flow issue there.,69,,
715,0.97,4290.286,4316.578,If the Council members elect to reduce the rates or change rates in some way we would want to send out a notice to potential rate payers ten days in advance of final Council action to inform them of proposed changes so they have an opportunity to weigh in and are fully aware of those.,69,,
716,0.97,4316.578,4332.661,"And finally, as drafted, the legislation would allow the initial program manager to serve in that capacity for five years prior to office of economic development conducting the competitive Rfp process to she can a program manager.",69,,
717,0.97,4332.661,4339.468,-- to select a program manager who will then have that role for five years before the process happens again.,69,,
718,0.97,4339.468,4345.04,So that would then leave the final term of the program manager to two years.,69,,
719,0.97,4345.04,4355.05,So what some options here are to amend the legislation to allow the program manager the initial program manager to serve for up to two years.,69,,
720,0.97,4355.05,4366.729,So this assumes that the twelve-year term for the Bia is unchanged and that would allow for there to be two full Five- year terms for the program manager and for the rest of the term.,69,,
721,0.97,4368.13,4373.602,That is it.,69,,
722,0.97,4373.602,4374.036,Any questions?,69,,
723,0.97,4374.036,4378.073,I have a question.,70,,
724,0.97,4378.073,4378.373,One second.,70,,
725,0.97,4378.373,4383.445,"So thank you, Yolanda.",70,,
726,0.97,4383.445,4391.12,"So I'm glad to see that there's an additional representative, a ten Nano representative added to the Advisory board.",70,,
727,0.97,4391.12,4392.02,I think that's important.,70,,
728,0.97,4392.02,4409.204,And I do want to ask about the point you made with Oed working with some rate payers across the city to create payment plans in response to the Covid- 19 crisis.,70,,
729,0.97,4409.204,4412.641,You mentioned the city hasn't gone back to have conversations with folks in the U district.,70,,
730,0.97,4412.641,4442.304,But I would like to hear from the U district folks about whether there have been any conversations with rate payers about changes in their current financial situation or their ability so pay a 10% increase and also just are there options? or have you considered options for payment plans if that's something that people have expressed interest in?,70,,
731,0.97,4444.973,4445.474,Maureen?,70,,
732,0.97,4445.474,4445.741,Or mark?,70,,
733,0.97,4445.741,4451.48,I just wanted to see if Phillip wanted to respond from the Oed perspective first.,71,,
734,0.97,4451.48,4454.449,I was differing to him first.,71,,
735,0.97,4454.449,4459.888,"Sure, thanks, mark, and Council member Morales for the question.",72,,
736,0.97,4459.888,4466.094,The majority of the fiscal year started January 1ST and they bill by annually for six months.,72,,
737,0.97,4466.094,4472.0,So I guess in short most of the property based bias have all ready received their first half of their budget.,72,,
738,0.97,4472.0,4487.816,"We're continuing to monitor to see what the second half assessments response will look like but we have protocols in place to work with rate payers, property owners and business owners to make monthly payment plans or make differ.",72,,
739,0.97,4487.816,4495.19,S as needed--Differments as needed.,72,,
740,0.97,4495.19,4497.359,"From there, we'll see where the question rate comes in.",72,,
741,0.97,4497.359,4502.798,"From a standpoint of FAS, the bill goes out and payments are due within 30 days.",72,,
742,0.97,4502.798,4514.376,We have included language to include for the next set of assessments to contact FAS to work with us if there's any financial burdens that a property and business owner might be facing.,72,,
743,0.97,4514.376,4532.861,And we're going to at this stage extend payment up to six months and we're willing to expand on that as need Bud it's obviously a balancing act between making possible options for the rate payers and ensuring funding exists for critical services and programs.,72,,
744,0.97,4532.861,4541.47,"Mark, I'll turn it over to you for the second half of the question.",72,,
745,0.97,4541.47,4544.139,Maureen or Louise?,72,,
746,0.97,4544.139,4545.44,Would you like to speak?,72,,
747,0.97,4545.44,4546.742,"Go ahead, mark.",73,,
748,0.97,4546.742,4555.684,"We talked about this a lot as we plan for the coming year, I think what we've come to is we need to follow the lead the city is setting.",74,,
749,0.97,4555.684,4558.654,This isn't a U district specific issue.,74,,
750,0.97,4558.654,4570.565,It's affecting all bias so we're interested.,74,,
751,0.97,4570.565,4579.808,Involved in conversations with Oed in a way in a coincides and cooperates with how it's being done city wide.,74,,
752,0.97,4579.808,4585.614,That's my very sincere answer opposed to trying to figure out a solution for this district specifically.,74,,
753,0.97,4585.614,4588.15,That doesn't seem like the wise or appropriate way to go about it.,74,,
754,0.97,4588.15,4593.422,In terms of conversations we're having with our rate payers about how are they feeling right now?,74,,
755,0.97,4593.422,4600.829,"You know, I think it varies to be Frank, I think there are some people who are just, you know, in a very difficult spot.",74,,
756,0.97,4600.829,4611.206,"But over all what we're hearing day in and day out, I think you heard it from public testimony today, so many people are saying thank goodness you're here and helping us through Covid.",74,,
757,0.97,4611.206,4618.58,You have to keep doing what you're doing.,74,,
758,0.97,4618.58,4620.182,We built critical relationships.,74,,
759,0.97,4620.182,4638.767,"The final thing I'll say is if you want the most contemporary reflection of what our businesses are saying Knowledgeably, it's found in the letter that we sent to you Council members signed by 30 businesses 1 and more letters we'll accepted from all over the District saying please support the Bia, we need it.",74,,
760,0.97,4638.767,4640.569,Their voice is on the table.,74,,
761,0.97,4640.569,4642.137,They're saying please continue.,74,,
762,0.97,4644.606,4644.973,Thank you.,74,,
763,0.97,4644.973,4647.376,"Thank you, mark, I appreciate that.",75,,
764,0.97,4647.376,4650.278,"Council member Peterson, you had a question.",75,,
765,0.97,4651.48,4651.78,.,75,,
766,0.97,4651.78,4660.789,"Thank you, chair Morales, getting back to the--thank you Yolanda for your memo where you identify a lot of issues.",76,,
767,0.97,4660.789,4669.798,"As I understand it, you're interested, today we're going to identify issues we as Council members care about.",76,,
768,0.97,4669.798,4673.301,These might turn into Mayor pro Tempores for our next meeting.,76,,
769,0.97,4673.301,4676.004,Soil just sort of start going down that road here.,76,,
770,0.97,4676.004,4690.318,Bang to the question about the length of term I know there's been concern expressed by the community that more than doubling the existing term is too long.,76,,
771,0.97,4690.318,4695.157,And didn't know if central staff had any views on that.,76,,
772,0.97,4695.157,4698.226,And then I have a couple more questions after that.,76,,
773,0.97,4698.226,4703.832,But going from five to twelve years seems like a big jump to me.,76,,
774,0.97,4706.334,4706.468,.,76,,
775,0.97,4706.468,4716.812,"Yeah, I guess I would differ to the Propoe News10S in this regard.",77,,
776,0.97,4716.812,4721.249,And Oed's analysis of that's what their proposal is.,77,,
777,0.97,4721.249,4730.192,"I think that, you know, I'd leave it to them for the rational there.",77,,
778,0.97,4730.192,4744.106,"As a general, you know, in terms of just kind of objectively, Yeah, it is a longer term but, you know, there's pros and Cons there with that.",77,,
779,0.97,4744.106,4748.243,As has been discussed.,77,,
780,0.97,4748.243,4748.81,Okay.,78,,
781,0.97,4748.81,4749.111,Thank you.,78,,
782,0.97,4749.111,4754.95,And I just wanted to see if you had any strong feelings about that.,78,,
783,0.97,4754.95,4760.322,I did--I heard the proponents talking about this in their comments.,78,,
784,0.97,4760.322,4766.895,So I don't think--I don't need to go back to them in for that issue on the term.,78,,
785,0.97,4766.895,4769.264,But my next question might duck tail into that.,78,,
786,0.97,4769.264,4791.653,"Because it's about the--so this concept of having a competitive process to select the program manager for a Bia--so here we have the program manager is the University district partnership there on the ground doing the work, doing the clean and safe work and the outreach work.",78,,
787,0.97,4791.653,4802.13,"They are, you know, they've got that work automatically when this Bia was set up five years ago.",78,,
788,0.97,4802.13,4809.004,"So this legislation says, you know what, we need to have a competitive process for this.",78,,
789,0.97,4809.004,4812.807,So section seven of the Council bill talks about this.,78,,
790,0.97,4812.807,4818.613,"Setting up an Rfp process, which I support having that competitive process.",78,,
791,0.97,4818.613,4828.123,"The legislation's a little bit--the way it's written, Yolanda interpreted it as this current program manager would be Grandfathered in for five years.",78,,
792,0.97,4828.123,4833.628,That seems like a really long time to be Grandfathered in.,78,,
793,0.97,4833.628,4836.965,"So one thought is, which Yolanda pointed out.",78,,
794,0.97,4836.965,4840.769,And I guess I'm signaling my support for this.,78,,
795,0.97,4840.769,4855.183,"To grandfather in that program manager for just a year or two so that--so that office of economic development and FAS can set up their Rfp process, get proposals in.",78,,
796,0.97,4855.183,4859.487,"Choose the winner, that group which could still be the University district partnership.",78,,
797,0.97,4859.487,4865.293,But Whoever wins an Rfp would then start up in one to two years from now.,78,,
798,0.97,4865.293,4870.599,"And then that would then determine Okay, well, how long would that crack be for?",78,,
799,0.97,4870.599,4872.868,Would it be for five years?,78,,
800,0.97,4872.868,4875.57,Would it be for four years?,78,,
801,0.97,4875.57,4886.915,"Would it be grandfather them in for a year, have a four-year term, and another Rfp, and then a four-year term, and one year cushion at the end.",78,,
802,0.97,4886.915,4887.215,So Yolanda.,78,,
803,0.97,4887.215,4901.997,I'll want to work with you to perhaps craft an amendment to specify that Grandfathering in period and what the subsequent Rfp periods would be.,78,,
804,0.97,4901.997,4902.664,Sounds good.,79,,
805,0.97,4906.334,4906.534,.,79,,
806,0.97,4906.534,4906.801,Okay.,80,,
807,0.97,4906.801,4910.805,"Those are all the questions I have right now, chair Morales.",80,,
808,0.97,4910.805,4911.106,Okay.,81,,
809,0.97,4911.106,4928.156,"Are there any other questions colleagues? about what we're hearing from either from the proponents or from central staff, things that you want clarified?",81,,
810,0.97,4928.156,4930.759,I don't see anything.,81,,
811,0.97,4930.759,4931.293,Council member Juarez?,81,,
812,0.97,4931.293,4934.529,I don't see you at all.,81,,
813,0.97,4934.529,4935.664,Half laugh.,82,,
814,0.97,4935.664,4935.964,Thank you.,82,,
815,0.97,4935.964,4938.199,Thank you chairwoman for checking in on me.,82,,
816,0.97,4938.199,4939.2,"I'm good, thank you.",82,,
817,0.97,4941.202,4941.936,.,82,,
818,0.97,4941.936,4942.203,Okay.,83,,
819,0.97,4942.203,4942.504,Very good.,83,,
820,0.97,4942.504,4950.478,"Well, in that case, if we have no other questions, I would say that we can wrap this up.",83,,
821,0.97,4950.478,4959.22,So this concludes the May 20th 2020 meeting of the community economic development committee.,83,,
822,0.97,4959.22,4965.56,"As Yolanda said earlier, our next committee meeting on this topic will be may 27th at 9:30.",83,,
823,0.97,4965.56,4969.698,And that will be the public hearing on the U district Bia proposal.,83,,
824,0.97,4969.698,4976.404,"So for the public, you can sign up to provide public comment on our Council Website, two Hourings beforehand.",83,,
825,0.97,4976.404,4987.549,"You can also submit comments to the Email address, which is U district Bia @ Seattle.Gov.",83,,
826,0.97,4987.549,4990.852,Udistrictbibia @ Seattle.Gov.,83,,
827,0.97,4990.852,4992.454,I think we are done here.,83,,
828,0.97,4992.454,4994.255,Thanks everyone for attending.,83,,
829,0.97,4994.255,4995.824,We are adjourned.,83,,
830,0.97,4995.824,4999.361,"Thank you, thank you, thanks everyone.",84,,
