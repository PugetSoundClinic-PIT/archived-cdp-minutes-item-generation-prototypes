28,0.97,215.014,217.85,"This morning, you will discuss the Federal Court monitor's report on SPD crisis intervention.",3,,
29,0.97,217.85,220.219,The report is based on the Self- serving Statistics provided by the SPD.,3,,
30,0.97,220.219,225.391,I have said all members have a detailed listing of the floors.,3,,
31,0.97,225.391,231.464,I can only highlight the most serious flaw in all the committee members will take a more active role in questioning the data presented.,3,,
32,0.97,231.464,244.444,"The report on crisis intervention claiming to show success was presente to the public on January 11th, barely 6 days after the SPD murdered another person in a mental health crisis.",3,,
33,0.97,244.444,245.278,The 19th such killing.,3,,
34,0.97,245.278,247.413,19 since they buried John C Williams a decade ago.,3,,
35,0.97,247.413,251.718,They were not investigated by the accountability system.,3,,
36,0.97,251.718,270.503,"The most serious thing is the monitor Repackages without any audit or interrogation--all those killed by the SPD while in mental health crisis are missing, simply absent from the data set, along with possibly other instances of serious use of force.",3,,
37,0.97,270.503,273.506,The monitor has accepted the self serving data as is.,3,,
38,0.97,273.506,288.321,"For this agenda item, and their first--the pattern of excessive force has been eliminated, citing the January 10th 2018 ruling.",3,,
39,0.97,288.321,289.822,This statement is false.,3,,
40,0.97,289.822,294.794,"They noted a reduction in the SPD's use of force, but not an elimination.",3,,
41,0.97,294.794,314.314,"In fact, the Seattle times revealed six months ago that an is pretty commissioned at an independent audit and shall continuing disparity with the use of force against black people 7.14 times per capita compared to white people.",3,,
42,0.97,314.314,320.119,"Additionally, this report repeals some of the most deadly uses of force strikes--more commonly move against black field compared to whites.",3,,
43,0.97,320.119,329.929,These reports of corruption--they demonstrate we clearly need --,3,,
44,0.97,329.929,331.197,Thank you so much.,4,,

48,0.97,343.343,343.576,Dennis?,4,,
49,0.97,343.576,344.143,Good morning.,5,,
50,0.97,344.143,351.884,Part of the thing about addressing something is to bring attention to it.,5,,
51,0.97,351.884,360.827,It is evident from the actions of the human services Department that it is being used to raise money in the name of addressing the never ending homeless crisis.,5,,
52,0.97,360.827,361.127,Excuse me.,5,,
53,0.97,361.127,366.966,Give me a second.,5,,
54,0.97,366.966,375.608,"Weighted--do not hang up, please.",5,,
55,0.97,375.608,404.57,"Anyway, the homeless crisis--the never ending homeless crisis is being furthered because human services is redirecting the money and applying it in races ways, where the government interim director is judging people based on their skin color and purposely discriminating against innocent homeless citizens, while Prioritizing criminals for a hotel room, compared to a Jailhouse.",5,,
56,0.97,404.57,419.318,They get everything delivered to them while innocent homeless suffer a third winter of Covid with absolutely no shelter or health from their racist human services Department.,5,,
57,0.97,419.318,428.06,The number one reason we never saw the homeless crisis--human services Department--turning against innocent local homeless citizens.,5,,
58,0.97,428.06,438.938,Seattle crates the most--a boycott of all the businesses.,5,,
59,0.97,438.938,452.251,"Secondly, the police consent decree is unconstitutional when you exempt crack, Meth, and heroin pushers from jail, who destroyed lives and get listed as nonviolent Misdemeanors based on the dollar amount, including society.",5,,
60,0.97,452.251,476.809,"It is telling the public safety committee that they go out of the way to undermine police reform while being a devil's advocate to intimidate and scare Council members to Capitulate to the activist demands of exempting from jail black and Brown truck pushers, while destroying those --",5,,
61,0.97,476.809,478.11,Our next Speaker is Alexander.,6,,
62,0.97,478.11,481.814,Alexander is also showing as not present.,6,,
63,0.97,481.814,489.188,"Going back up to bill Sanders, also showing they are not present.",6,,
64,0.97,489.188,498.397,Can you confirm these two individuals and find out--he was here a moment ago.,6,,
65,0.97,498.397,500.233,It is still showing they are not present.,6,,
66,0.97,500.233,510.276,There are no other public comment registrants in the Queue.,7,,
67,0.97,510.276,511.544,"Hopefully, they have comments for us.",8,,
68,0.97,511.544,522.088,They can send it on via Email.,8,,
69,0.97,525.324,529.095,We will start with the first item.,9,,
70,0.97,529.095,534.901,"Please read the agenda item, please.",9,,
71,0.97,534.901,539.505,Agenda item number one.,10,,
72,0.97,539.505,541.474,Consent decree update outreach meetings for briefing and discussion.,10,,
73,0.97,541.474,542.842,Thank you so much.,11,,
74,0.97,542.842,558.457,We are looking at the monitor for an update about the work that they are doing in their role as a monitor for the consent decree.,11,,
75,0.97,558.457,560.326,I very much appreciate them joining the committee today.,11,,
76,0.97,560.326,573.039,"Before we hand it over, we are going to first equip overview and provide some background of the consent decree.",11,,
77,0.97,573.039,577.476,It has been in effect in Seattle since the summer of 2012 and it has taken place in recent years.,11,,
78,0.97,577.476,582.949,Could you provide more with the overview of the consent decree?,11,,
79,0.97,582.949,593.292,"Yes, thank you.",12,,
80,0.97,600.066,601.3,"Members of the committee, good morning.",12,,
81,0.97,601.3,603.369,"Alex, if you would not mind, but in my presentation?",12,,
82,0.97,603.369,604.17,Thank you very much.,12,,
83,0.97,604.17,609.075,"Just to go through this really quickly, to tee up the monitor presentation, I think you are fairly familiar with the consent decree.",12,,
84,0.97,609.075,629.695,"A little bit of background though--in 2011, the city and the Department of justice entered into a settlement agreement that required SPD to work with a federally appointed monitor to reform its policies and Retrained his officers in an effort to address a pattern and practice of excessive force.",12,,
85,0.97,629.695,644.377,"In January of 2018, the court found that SPD had reduced its use of serious force, reduced to the instances of unconstitutional and unnecessary force, and therefore had achieved compliance with the consent decree.",12,,
86,0.97,644.377,654.453,"That means, as a legal manner only, SPD had eliminated the practice of unconstitutional force.",12,,
87,0.97,654.453,674.04,"The staff makes this observation as a purely legal point and in no way means to diminish the studies that have been noted in the last couple of years that have found racial disparities in, say, stops in Detention, when particular in 2019.",12,,
88,0.97,674.04,688.654,"As a purely legal matter, the court found that SPD was in compliance with the consent decree in 2018.",12,,
89,0.97,688.654,700.566,"After achieving compliance, the consent decree requires that they sustain it for a period of two years and that period was expected to run from 2018 to 2020.",12,,
90,0.97,700.566,716.382,It would have been terminated after.,12,,
91,0.97,719.118,721.12,"However, it was not terminated because of two significant events.",12,,
92,0.97,721.12,724.323,The first was a new police Union contract that was finalized in November of 2018.,12,,
93,0.97,724.323,728.36,The court found that the contract had caused the city to fall out of compliance in the area of accountability.,12,,
94,0.97,728.36,738.671,"The court expressed concerns about disciplinary appeals, specifically an are but there is ruling that a reinstated officer that had been fired for excessive force was reinstated, I think.",12,,
95,0.97,738.671,740.673,They are familiar with the details of the Shepard case.,12,,
96,0.97,740.673,741.874,I will not go into it.,12,,
97,0.97,741.874,757.923,The judge had said that he was not necessarily deciding whether to the decision in the case was right or wrong but that the arbitration process and the Department--they had weakened the system to the point of violating the consent decree.,12,,
98,0.97,757.923,770.302,"Also, there were limits of Oig and OPA's authority, and a subpoena of 40 was one that was cited.",12,,
99,0.97,770.302,779.178,"Since then, the city has made some changes in the area of accountability in an effort to address the court's concerns and come back to subpoena authorities.",12,,
100,0.97,779.178,806.472,They have passed an ordinance on subpoena authority that would allow for those who were being subpoenaed to be aware of their rights and the city has also made other efforts in the area of accountability regarding transparency and OPA publishing their case statuses.,12,,
101,0.97,806.472,840.706,"So the city is making efforts, where they can, without having to negotiate further steps, they are in the process of negotiating for further steps and that would include the ability to serve subpoenas and then the second event was the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which inspired the nationwide demonstrations against police brutality in the summer of 2020.",12,,
102,0.97,840.706,844.41,City leaders and the public raised concerns about plastics that SPD used in response to the protests.,12,,
103,0.97,844.41,847.913,"Prior to that, the city and DOJ had filed a motion to terminate the consent decree.",12,,
104,0.97,847.913,860.993,"Days into the protest, the city withdrew that motion to allow for an examination of SPD's use of force during the protests.",12,,
105,0.97,860.993,870.97,"After the events of 2020, the court approved the new monitoring plan to reassess SPD's compliance in all areas of the consent decree, including crowd management, and to build the capacity of the Fleece accountability system.",12,,
106,0.97,870.97,876.375,"So, with that as a high-level overview, I will ask if there are any questions before this gets passed over.",12,,
107,0.97,876.375,879.645,"Thank you, Greg.",13,,
108,0.97,879.645,893.692,"Before we move to another presentation, do you have any questions for Greg on the background of the consent decree?",13,,
109,0.97,893.692,894.26,I am seeing none.,13,,
110,0.97,894.26,895.527,I do have one quick question.,13,,
111,0.97,895.527,918.784,"Greg, I recall when we passed the last contract, we also passed a resolution that highlighted three issues that the Council felt was important to raise within the context of the court's consideration of the consent decree.",13,,
112,0.97,918.784,939.204,Is that correct and did you cover those areas in your presentation and the areas that were specifically called out in the resolution?,13,,
113,0.97,939.204,939.505,A,13,,
114,0.97,939.505,940.372,You are correct.,14,,
115,0.97,940.372,942.541,The Council did do that and I did not cover it.,14,,
116,0.97,942.541,945.577,"Off the top of my head, I do not remember what those three were.",14,,
117,0.97,945.577,947.68,"Okay, maybe we can come back to it.",15,,
118,0.97,947.68,957.289,"With that, I think a great Segue into another presentation . We will pass the baton to you.",15,,
119,0.97,957.289,957.89,Thank you.,15,,
120,0.97,957.89,959.425,"Thank you, Chairperson.",16,,
121,0.97,959.425,961.527,It is great to be with you today.,16,,
122,0.97,961.527,980.312,"I think this year is going to be a very affable year for compliance and work--we are looking forward to a robust and rigorous partnership with all of you, to better charge a course for the future.",16,,
123,0.97,980.312,983.649,"With that, I will share a brief presentation that I will share Ith you all.",16,,
124,0.97,983.649,993.058,Let me pull this up.,16,,
125,0.97,993.058,993.258,Okay.,16,,
126,0.97,993.258,995.794,"Can you see that, Chairperson?",16,,
127,0.97,995.794,1019.985,"Just one point of--that Website, you can find the current in process preliminary assessments that we will be talking about, as well as areas for public feedback, so you can find that directly on the Seattle police Monitor.Org Website.",16,,
128,0.97,1019.985,1034.733,"This morning, that week to do an overview of monitoring activities, particularly working on early in 2022.",16,,
129,0.97,1034.733,1036.668,We had a community engagement session that we discussed.,16,,
130,0.97,1036.668,1045.878,We will touch bases on some high level action and what is year may look like as far as Deliverables and then addressing any discussions or answering questions.,16,,
131,0.97,1045.878,1059.558,"We did do a public community engagement session, as mentioned earlier, around the first Limitary assessment crisis intervention.",16,,
132,0.97,1059.558,1065.731,"This session, we were not setting this up to talk only about crisis intervention, but to provide a broader overview of activities.",16,,
133,0.97,1065.731,1075.808,We want to talk about crisis intervention if that is needed.,16,,
134,0.97,1075.808,1077.076,Some overview of the monitoring activities.,16,,
135,0.97,1077.076,1084.917,"The role of the monitor, as you likely know, is to be--compliance with the consent decree's.",16,,
136,0.97,1084.917,1102.367,"In many ways, my role is to act as a person who can come in and work with all the parties with alignments and to figure out what we are working on and to do something with that process.",16,,
137,0.97,1102.367,1105.17,To get them in compliance and potential closer downstream of the consent decree's.,16,,
138,0.97,1105.17,1113.345,All of the work and the monitoring team is geared towards Elaborative fleet working with all the parties on this.,16,,
139,0.97,1113.345,1120.018,"So, you can disregard that top line.",16,,
140,0.97,1120.018,1132.464,There are four areas of their that myself and the monitoring team are working on.,16,,
141,0.97,1132.464,1134.299,One is evaluating the status of compliance.,16,,
142,0.97,1134.299,1138.904,"Essentially, looking probably at the consent decree to measure progress on that.",16,,
143,0.97,1138.904,1150.916,"To do that, we developed a methodology, meeting the set of measures, both quantitative and qualitative, to understand progress of SPD and we do an assessment.",16,,
144,0.97,1150.916,1160.859,We collect data and we look at measures and we package it up and produce that in the form of assessments that you have access to.,16,,
145,0.97,1160.859,1164.83,The second major area that we have is around accountability.,16,,
146,0.97,1164.83,1175.807,So they are in the monitoring plan that we do year after year.,16,,
147,0.97,1175.807,1190.822,"We look at it from the perspective of front end accountability, which means things the city and SPD can do to prevent bad things from happening in the field, as well as back end accountability.",16,,
148,0.97,1190.822,1195.26,"If there is something an officer that does that might break a rule or a policy, an action takes place.",16,,
149,0.97,1195.26,1199.531,What happens with that accountability as far as discipline and remediation in learning that takes place going forward?,16,,
150,0.97,1199.531,1203.101,Taking a direct look at accountability in many facets is a big perk.,16,,
151,0.97,1203.101,1210.943,"The third major component, the third and fourth are more technical assistance.",16,,
152,0.97,1210.943,1232.364,"It is risk management, looking at things that help the city and SPD have more capabilities around things like ANALYTICS and to help improve officer wellness and to look at areas around data and insights and the tools and Technologies for that.",16,,
153,0.97,1232.364,1240.172,"Advising the city on how that could work with the consent decree is one of the components, as well as advising and Reimagining public safety.",16,,
154,0.97,1240.172,1269.701,"The previous administration, and with the city council looking at how public safety can be redesigned in the future, the role of the team is not to govern that, but in order to help the city and Seattle police Department, to figure out how can that come forward in ways that are productive and that might not run counter to the consent decree and building up those overall capabilities.",16,,
155,0.97,1269.701,1277.542,Those are the four major components of what we do through the course of the year.,16,,
156,0.97,1277.542,1280.278,"It is my role, as well as the associate monitors that work with me.",16,,
157,0.97,1280.278,1294.426,"As far as the baseline of our work, and line items underneath these four, you can see the monitoring plan.",16,,
158,0.97,1294.426,1296.995,"Around compliance, this is the biggest thing we are looking at.",16,,
159,0.97,1296.995,1299.865,"When will the consent decree, what kind of progress has been happening?",16,,
160,0.97,1299.865,1307.906,How do we look at that progress and measure it?,16,,
161,0.97,1307.906,1313.945,"Compliance, of course, it is driven by this methodology we talked about, which was established through the course of last year.",16,,
162,0.97,1313.945,1332.164,"On the second monitor for the consent decree, as you know, one of the first things we did coming in, in late 2019, late 2020 is working with all of the parties in early 2021 to develop a methodology.",16,,
163,0.97,1332.164,1334.833,"That includes the attorney's office, the Pa, and all the parties.",16,,
164,0.97,1334.833,1338.87,"The CDC, et cetera.",16,,
165,0.97,1338.87,1351.917,"We are looking at four major areas to assess compliance, to do a conference of assessment.",16,,
166,0.97,1351.917,1353.151,One is around crisis intervention.,16,,
167,0.97,1353.151,1354.453,The second is around stops in detentions.,16,,
168,0.97,1354.453,1360.258,Looking at how SPD performs that will include excessive measures around bias and impact.,16,,
169,0.97,1360.258,1362.494,The third area is around use of force.,16,,
170,0.97,1362.494,1372.204,"That will include a deep dive, look into use of force under crowd management settings.",16,,
171,0.97,1372.204,1373.505,The fourth area is around supervision.,16,,
172,0.97,1373.505,1377.576,So looking at the processes and operations of SPD.,16,,
173,0.97,1377.576,1386.384,"As we build these assessments, there are three major documents.",16,,
174,0.97,1386.384,1387.619,Supervision will be embedded in each one.,16,,
175,0.97,1387.619,1397.696,"As we look at crisis intervention, use of force, we will take a look at those relative to how supervision works within those.",16,,
176,0.97,1397.696,1408.273,"These four areas form the basis, the constitutional policing around the pattern and practice of this type of work.",16,,
177,0.97,1408.273,1416.081,"We will be printing them out to the community, of course.",16,,
178,0.97,1416.081,1418.617,We will have a session for each one of these sessions.,16,,
179,0.97,1418.617,1426.591,We have one in January there is Úcrisis intervention.,16,,
180,0.97,1426.591,1438.37,"We have one coming up in February and--and the third one, use of force in March, in which we will engage the community on dialogue.",16,,
181,0.97,1438.37,1447.813,"For all those, we released a preliminary assessment, first publicly, so everyone can read it before they come into those meetings.",16,,
182,0.97,1447.813,1450.382,"If they have questions or comments, they can be fully up to speed.",16,,
183,0.97,1450.382,1459.858,Then we will take those meetings and network and we will be looking at three major questions for the community.,16,,
184,0.97,1459.858,1471.603,"As we get into each one of those assessment areas, we will ask them and all of you as well if there are specific ideas, based on these findings in these assessments, where we can see improvements.",16,,
185,0.97,1471.603,1473.071,"For example, crisis intervention in Seattle.",16,,
186,0.97,1473.071,1478.743,The city can do it on their own.,16,,
187,0.97,1478.743,1482.814,"Big ideas, innovation, changes that can take place based on those findings.",16,,
188,0.97,1482.814,1501.733,"The second question would be is there any research or advocacy with crisis intervention, for example, as we get to stop detentions and use of force, that the Seattle community leasing Commission should pursue in 2022.",16,,
189,0.97,1501.733,1521.586,"We are taking very intentional looks to say are there things the city can be doing, the public can be doing, the committee can be doing based on this research?",16,,
190,0.97,1521.586,1532.731,"Third, we will ask, based on these findings, is there any thing--are there certain items that the Federal monitor should continue to oversee in 2022 and work on with all the parties?",16,,
191,0.97,1532.731,1535.033,We will do a rigorous process and bring these measures forward.,16,,
192,0.97,1535.033,1542.007,"We will talk to the community and city Council and the progress, trying to gain as many ideas as possible.",16,,
193,0.97,1542.007,1554.052,"That way, we can move forward in a way, for the city to have more compliance, better compliance, and effective closure of some of these categories as we move forward.",16,,
194,0.97,1554.052,1572.27,"All of this--we really need the city council's input and ideas and engagement on this, to not only reach out to the community but also to have your ideas on how we move forward with these areas.",16,,
195,0.97,1572.27,1601.466,"So, that is a broad stroke overview of what we are working are putting in place . Ess we I should mention one of the things we are doing with these action steps in 2022 is we are finalizing the community feedback and ideas from all the parties and filing those assessments with the court.",16,,
196,0.97,1602.934,1612.711,"We are working, thinking through how we do that, if we do that Sequentially, where we file crisis intervention and then stop detentions and use of force individually, as we finish with them and work with the community, or we do them all at once.",16,,
197,0.97,1612.711,1614.579,"There is some deliberation on that, that particular item.",16,,
198,0.97,1614.579,1618.116,Your feedback would be important as well.,16,,
199,0.97,1618.116,1620.852,"From that, we will also develop the monitoring plan for 2022.",16,,
200,0.97,1620.852,1628.593,There will be some carryover items that are part of that monitoring plan.,16,,
201,0.97,1628.593,1631.396,There are ongoing things.,16,,
202,0.97,1631.396,1645.143,There are other areas like this while also having ongoing technical assistance and things with accountability that we are currently working on.,16,,
203,0.97,1645.143,1652.217,"From the community and community feedback, we will pull in ideas, potentially for the city or the monitoring team to be working on this year.",16,,
204,0.97,1652.217,1666.731,"In total, I think we have a good plan for how to not only assess compliance for SPD, but to engage the community on what comes next.",16,,
205,0.97,1666.731,1668.466,We are at a critical time with consent decree's.,16,,
206,0.97,1668.466,1671.636,You can see an inflection point and it has been roughly 10 years since 2020.,16,,
207,0.97,1671.636,1691.723,"There are people that have come into this arena, so to say, and they have--they are taking in their interest in policing.",16,,
208,0.97,1691.723,1695.927,There are a lot of new people that are engaged in this process as well and that is a good thing.,16,,
209,0.97,1695.927,1701.299,We want them to be engaged and we need this year to be somewhat of a level set of where we are at with this.,16,,
210,0.97,1701.299,1702.133,Where are we going next?,16,,
211,0.97,1702.133,1704.469,Can we have legitimacy?,16,,
212,0.97,1704.469,1707.906,We can all collectively say here is where we are and where we need to go.,16,,
213,0.97,1707.906,1710.041,Here is where the finish line is.,16,,
214,0.97,1710.041,1726.825,"So with that, I guess we can go to the Q & amp; a, if you would like, or we can talk about the questions that came up earlier or crisis intervention questions.",16,,
215,0.97,1726.825,1729.594,Can you get the slides up?,17,,
216,0.97,1729.594,1734.599,Thanks.,17,,
217,0.97,1734.599,1742.74,"On page--sorry, slide four, there are a few questions that I will be watching.",17,,
218,0.97,1742.74,1754.552,Why don't I just get a little bit of a sense first--you explained the role of the preliminary assessment.,17,,
219,0.97,1754.552,1764.429,"I am--first, I should probably let folks know that that is out now for the preliminary is Isis.",17,,
220,0.97,1764.429,1777.542,"I understand that you are, you know, part of the process, soliciting comments.",17,,
221,0.97,1777.542,1783.615,You had mentioned that you encourage comments from the public and from folks in your meetings and from the council as well.,17,,
222,0.97,1783.615,1795.86,"I'm wondering, is there a Timeline that you are considering for accepting comment on that preliminary assessment on the crisis intervention, which is out?",17,,
223,0.97,1795.86,1797.562,"I think it is on your Website, correct?",17,,
224,0.97,1797.562,1799.964,Your new launch Website.,17,,
225,0.97,1799.964,1800.365,Yes.,18,,
226,0.97,1800.365,1802.433,We do not have a deadline as of yet.,18,,
227,0.97,1802.433,1808.173,We want to keep it open.,18,,
228,0.97,1808.173,1816.981,The Diming is driven by when we file with the court.,18,,
229,0.97,1816.981,1835.466,"We are in the process of trying to gain feedback from the community, getting feedback from the parties, the city as a whole to, you know, ask certain questions and maybe refinance certain things, you know, if there are new measures they might have to take a look at, et cetera.",18,,
230,0.97,1835.466,1839.237,"Once we collect all that, we will patch this up and submitted to the court.",18,,
231,0.97,1839.237,1852.383,"Again, you can follow me Sequentially--if we follow them all at once, we are looking at a filing with the court sometime in early April or so.",18,,
232,0.97,1852.383,1857.989,That would be a broad target.,18,,
233,0.97,1857.989,1860.358,"If we do it Sequentially, crisis intervention will be much sooner.",18,,
234,0.97,1860.358,1864.662,We can definitely relate timing if we need to close out timing for that.,18,,
235,0.97,1864.662,1865.33,Thank you.,19,,
236,0.97,1865.33,1882.247,"As it relates to the preliminary assessment report, it does say and I appreciate this is highlighted--there is some sunshine on this issue.",19,,
237,0.97,1882.247,1896.227,They say the monitoring team and the police Department have shown some instances where use of force may not have been happily implemented as a crisis contact.,19,,
238,0.97,1896.227,1902.133,They have received a constituent Email that RAISES three questions.,19,,
239,0.97,1902.133,1916.147,"One, has data been excluded, where people were killed in crisis instances?",19,,
240,0.97,1916.147,1925.757,"Have police context improperly Cataloged as a crisis contact, and is there a clear definition for what constitutes crisis contact?",19,,
241,0.97,1925.757,1938.469,"Yes, starting with one, there is--it has been standardized in policy and practice.",20,,
242,0.97,1938.469,1953.017,"I should mention as well, to those questions, one of the public comments raised the question of, you know, is the monitor just essentially using SPD data and Repackaging it or what not?",20,,
243,0.97,1953.017,1954.952,The answer--that is a fascinating question.,20,,
244,0.97,1954.952,1969.133,"If you look at, you know, how independent the monitoring is.",20,,
245,0.97,1970.735,1972.337,That is another way to look at this.,20,,
246,0.97,1972.337,1973.971,This is designed to be an independent evaluation.,20,,
247,0.97,1973.971,1981.446,"The last six or seven years of the monitoring of the consent decree, the monitor of the previous--they have worked with the city to develop one of the nation's leading ANALYTICS capabilities in policing, right?",20,,
248,0.97,1981.446,2005.136,"So the city of Seattle, the Council, we have put a lot of time and energy into developing the data and the ANALYTICS and the capacity of the Seattle police Department.",20,,
249,0.97,2005.136,2007.205,"Much of that, pretty much all of it is transparent.",20,,
250,0.97,2007.205,2009.607,"It is on the public Dashboards for the Seattle police Department, et cetera.",20,,
251,0.97,2009.607,2013.177,We do use that data and we look at it for our own minds and evaluated.,20,,
252,0.97,2013.177,2016.314,"Some people raised the question of, well, should we have a completely independent look at the data?",20,,
253,0.97,2016.314,2017.382,This is an independent look.,20,,
254,0.97,2017.382,2023.121,"If you are saying we need new data, no, we need a new data architecture.",20,,
255,0.97,2023.121,2025.39,We spent a lot of time building this already.,20,,
256,0.97,2025.39,2036.634,So the accuracy of the data is really solid.,20,,
257,0.97,2036.634,2040.338,"As far as anyone in crisis that--were there was a level of force, that is documented.",20,,
258,0.97,2040.338,2042.84,There is no one excluded from that.,20,,
259,0.97,2042.84,2050.982,"There are some rare instances, where there was use of force and initially that was not classified as a crisis call.",20,,
260,0.97,2050.982,2059.19,"As that worked through the system, you can retroactively put that on a certain call, right?",20,,
261,0.97,2059.19,2075.84,"Sometimes they have rare circumstances, where there is a use of force, where those go into investigations and the paperwork and such, where there is a bit of a lag and we say, guess, look at that situation.",20,,
262,0.97,2075.84,2077.575,That person was in a crisis situation.,20,,
263,0.97,2077.575,2081.479,That is definitely something we have seen and looked at and have Cataloged with all this data.,20,,
264,0.97,2081.479,2084.916,I want to move.,21,,
265,0.97,2084.916,2085.75,I just want to follow-up.,21,,
266,0.97,2085.75,2098.563,So the statement that the moderating team and SPD have identified some instances where use of force may not have been properly documented as a crisis contact.,21,,
267,0.97,2098.563,2112.176,Are you saying that initially it was not properly document it as a crisis contact and then at documented? was properly,21,,
268,0.97,2112.176,2113.01,That is correct.,22,,
269,0.97,2113.01,2116.38,"It was documented, right?",22,,
270,0.97,2116.38,2118.349,It is almost like a qualitative type of a review.,22,,
271,0.97,2118.349,2133.297,"It did not impact the data or the numbers but we are saying we want to make sure that the process is sound, where if there is a crisis, that it is documented at the appropriate time.",22,,
272,0.97,2133.297,2144.509,"There are a few rare examples, where, just in the nature of policing, the speed of work and things happening, that the crisis contact form was not completed at the very beginning.",22,,
273,0.97,2144.509,2150.181,So making sure that process was solid.,22,,
274,0.97,2150.181,2152.783,"You know, the qualitative finding, you could say, is something being addressed.",22,,
275,0.97,2152.783,2159.857,Thank you so much.,23,,
276,0.97,2159.857,2160.358,Sara Nelson?,23,,
277,0.97,2160.358,2161.893,He said something that RAISES another point.,24,,
278,0.97,2161.893,2174.205,"When you talk about qualitative assessment, is that because--could it be because use of force or--is it because it was unclear or what?",24,,
279,0.97,2174.205,2177.875,Can you try that one more time?,25,,
280,0.97,2177.875,2187.919,"When the contacted--what was being asked was if these cases, the crisis form was not filled out.",26,,
281,0.97,2187.919,2198.362,Did that have anything to do with understanding of changing of laws or anything like that?,26,,
282,0.97,2198.362,2201.232,"No, no.",27,,
283,0.97,2201.232,2228.025,"Again, I can come back with exact numbers, but a very small, very small number of instances where--not based on changes in policy, but the process that played out in that particular day and that particular incident, that an officer may have forgotten or waited for a while or, as they looked backwards, potentially had a situation.",27,,
284,0.97,2228.025,2229.694,"That person was in crisis, so we should documented.",27,,
285,0.97,2229.694,2232.897,Thank you.,28,,
286,0.97,2232.897,2242.707,"Thank you, we have another question about this.",29,,
287,0.97,2242.707,2253.517,"You are including, under this a bullet, bias impact, even though my recollection is that doing the finding for policing.",29,,
288,0.97,2253.517,2283.414,"Nevertheless, it is an area of great concern for residents of the city, considering that even in instances where we have seen a reduction in use of force, a reduction of--I should say a reduction in instances of the use of force and a reduction of instances in the use of force against people in crisis.",29,,
289,0.97,2283.414,2296.56,"The racial disparity in policing continues and--some period of years, it has actually increased.",29,,
290,0.97,2296.56,2325.589,"So, just given that this was not a technical finding of the court, and we are under that issue, what I really appreciate--the city attorney in the city's fight link, even as we report on productions of use of force, we are still identifying Proactively, even though we may not legally have to.",29,,
291,0.97,2325.589,2335.566,"I think it is the right thing to do, to I to fight and call out the continued disparity in policing.",29,,
292,0.97,2335.566,2349.714,"I am just interested to know, from your perspective, how you will consider that information as part of your assessment of the city's compliance?",29,,
293,0.97,2349.714,2350.114,Right.,30,,
294,0.97,2350.114,2351.115,Thank you for that question.,30,,
295,0.97,2351.115,2351.782,"First, you're correct.",30,,
296,0.97,2351.782,2356.454,The Department of justice and our initial investigation flagged this.,30,,
297,0.97,2356.454,2366.564,They did not include it in the settlement agreement as a core area for monitoring and the consent decree.,30,,
298,0.97,2366.564,2388.686,"That being said, it is so embedded within these areas, particularly stops and detentions, that when you do the assessment, you find data and insights that highlight areas of bias and any impact.",30,,
299,0.97,2388.686,2421.118,"The rationale for including it within the methodology is not to say that the monitoring team was going to directly work on this issue, but to say, Okay, let's learn as a city what the state of this is, so--going back to those initial questions I had on the slide, what is it that the city can do properly, going forward, to work on this?",30,,
300,0.97,2421.118,2426.056,"How do we, in particular, how do we look across the agencies and across plans to get to the root cause of disparity and impact?",30,,
301,0.97,2426.056,2440.771,Are there new things the city to be doing across human services and housing and mental health and policing and all these other services that create an environment where there is disparity?,30,,
302,0.97,2440.771,2457.054,"Are there certain practices or policies that are in place that should be changed at SPD, in order to reduce any bias and disparity--training policies, practice changes in order to reduce that as much as possible.",30,,
303,0.97,2457.054,2467.698,"Really, there is argument to help the city, to help--they can take care of it.",30,,
304,0.97,2467.698,2473.237,"If there is something that the city says, Hey, we need Federal oversight to make sure something sticks, that we can work with you on that.",30,,
305,0.97,2473.237,2475.606,Thank you.,31,,
306,0.97,2475.606,2498.028,"As it relates specifically to the data collection piece, the data that we are working with right now, SPD has done under its own analysis--that was truth tested by the center for policing and equity.",31,,
307,0.97,2498.028,2522.152,"It covered a period between around 2014 to 2019, whereas, you know, it is 2022 and, you know, the consent decree process is a process moving through time and measuring improvement, hopefully, over a period of time.",31,,
308,0.97,2522.152,2568.999,"There is going to be, I think, an interest in collecting new data but I am concerned over 2021--it might not be a good measure of those interactions, of Covid and reduced police contact during 2021., so, there is a sort of intention there of wanting to collect new data in order to look to see whether or not there have been improvements or not and the recognition that we have different set of circumstances in 2021.",31,,
309,0.97,2568.999,2584.181,"Compared to 2020, when use of force was an a normally associated with the crowd control activities of the police Department.",31,,
310,0.97,2584.181,2589.053,In the wake of the George Floyd protests.,31,,
311,0.97,2589.053,2603.534,"So, I am just wondering, how do we walk that line while being able to demonstrate sort of rigorous analysis of the data while recognizing that they are anomalies?",31,,
312,0.97,2603.534,2616.38,"I think that is an important question to be thinking about, as far as compliance and enclosure of the consent decree, and what does success look like, really?",32,,
313,0.97,2616.38,2624.121,Over what period of time and when is it legitimate to say we have accomplished what the consent decree is set up for.,32,,
314,0.97,2624.121,2633.964,"Go back and there are other assessments from previous years, that we build on.",32,,
315,0.97,2633.964,2636.367,"We built complaints in 2016 and 2019, et cetera.",32,,
316,0.97,2636.367,2640.304,It Uncovers is a couple years worth of data.,32,,
317,0.97,2640.304,2653.217,"We need to look at, you know, I guess it is a big question for city Council and the city.",32,,
318,0.97,2653.217,2653.884,Is that enough?,32,,
319,0.97,2653.884,2659.289,"We do have a methodology in place, so we can Rerun Dater later on this year, that is the direction the city wanted to go.",32,,
320,0.97,2659.289,2667.097,The monitoring team or the city could--I mentioned most of the data is on the dashboard and it is accessible.,32,,
321,0.97,2667.097,2672.703,There are different ways people can analyze it to get inside.,32,,
322,0.97,2672.703,2695.159,"I would look to you and your guidance, where you want the monitoring team to weigh in, if we should do these assessments another time, additional time this year or a portion of it, to get to--you know, to feel comfortable with where we are.",32,,
323,0.97,2695.159,2696.894,Thank you so much.,33,,
324,0.97,2696.894,2699.396,Any other questions from Council members?,33,,
325,0.97,2699.396,2704.601,Before we close out?,33,,
326,0.97,2704.601,2705.469,"Going once, going twice?",33,,
327,0.97,2705.469,2708.372,"All right, thank you so much for being with us today.",33,,
328,0.97,2708.372,2718.582,"For the public--there is a meeting on February 8th, 2022.",33,,
329,0.97,2718.582,2723.287,"If you want information about that, you can contact my office--you can contact the CPC.",33,,
330,0.97,2723.287,2727.558,They are doing these in collaboration with the police Commission.,33,,
331,0.97,2727.558,2736.867,You can also contact the monitor at the Website.,33,,
332,0.97,2736.867,2737.501,I really appreciate your time.,33,,
333,0.97,2737.501,2738.135,"Thank you, everyone.",33,,
334,0.97,2738.135,2738.769,Goodbye.,34,,
335,0.97,2738.769,2744.541,Will the clerk please read item 2?,35,,
336,0.97,2744.541,2750.013,"Audit of disciplinary system for Seattle police Department personnel, for briefing and discussion.",36,,
337,0.97,2750.013,2753.951,Thank you so much.,37,,
338,0.97,2753.951,2764.294,"Thank you for joining us, where we are joined by the office Inspector, Lisa judge, for personnel.",37,,
339,0.97,2764.294,2774.171,Could Presenters with us today please start off with a quick round of introduction and then we will proceed with the presentation?,37,,
340,0.97,2774.171,2775.706,"Good morning, Chairperson Herbold and charter members.",38,,
341,0.97,2775.706,2779.977,It is great for me to be here.,38,,
342,0.97,2779.977,2783.247,My name is Lisa judge and I am the inspector general for public safety.,38,,
343,0.97,2783.247,2787.151,I will let my auditor introduced himself.,38,,
344,0.97,2787.151,2795.192,Thank you for having us.,39,,
345,0.97,2795.192,2799.429,My name is Dan Pitts and I am one of the leaders and I will do most of the presentation today.,39,,
346,0.97,2799.429,2800.931,Thank you so much.,40,,
347,0.97,2800.931,2807.437,"Inspector General judge and Dan, we are living appreciate you spending time with me.",40,,
348,0.97,2807.437,2823.086,This audit was hot off the presses and they are very impressed with the analysis and I think some very significant recommendations that you are making with this audit.,40,,
349,0.97,2823.086,2825.155,"So, with that, I hand it over to you.",40,,
350,0.97,2825.155,2825.422,Okay.,41,,
351,0.97,2825.422,2826.056,Go ahead.,42,,
352,0.97,2826.056,2826.623,"Sorry, Dan.",43,,
353,0.97,2826.623,2837.301,I was going to take a couple seconds.,43,,
354,0.97,2837.301,2840.037,I know you are short on time and this is packed with information.,43,,
355,0.97,2840.037,2842.172,I wanted to highlight this is a body of ongoing work.,43,,
356,0.97,2842.172,2847.744,"We first started with a project to understand the discipline system and that was a fairly expensive subway map, a process map.",43,,
357,0.97,2847.744,2856.453,This then builds on that initial work of trying to understand the discipline system with a foray into analysis.,43,,
358,0.97,2856.453,2859.59,"With that, I will let Dan take it away, to describe his excellent work.",43,,
359,0.97,2859.59,2860.257,Thank you.,43,,
360,0.97,2860.257,2864.862,Can I share the screen here?,44,,
361,0.97,2864.862,2872.97,"Okay, so thanks again for this afternoon.",44,,
362,0.97,2872.97,2880.444,This is--this was a very large audit and we covered a lot of ground and a lot of findings and matters for consideration.,44,,
363,0.97,2880.444,2886.083,We will do our best to pack as much detail as quick as we can.,44,,
364,0.97,2886.083,2900.33,"We are going to cover, not necessarily all of the findings, but some of the ones we feel are key . hopefully, we have time.",44,,
365,0.97,2900.33,2904.401,"Council members can feel free to stop me at any point, if you need to ask questions.",44,,
366,0.97,2904.401,2907.738,"Otherwise, we will hopefully have time at the end to ask questions.",44,,
367,0.97,2907.738,2914.845,Without further delay--we will talk about what the audit was.,44,,
368,0.97,2914.845,2925.289,"We were looking at assessing the timeliness, fairness, consistency, and more for SPD sworn personnel.",44,,
369,0.97,2925.289,2930.527,These adjectives are used in the accountability to describe what the disciplinary system should be.,44,,
370,0.97,2930.527,2944.508,"The scope of our audit was from disciplinary actions that took place in January 1st, 2018, through much of March 2021.",44,,
371,0.97,2944.508,2948.445,That is the day we started field work and that is when they cut off our data.,44,,
372,0.97,2948.445,2951.581,The focus of it was on the last half of the disciplinary process.,44,,
373,0.97,2951.581,2969.733,"What happens after the director recommends the same finding for the formation of discipline and the determination of discipline and we also took a look at the enforcement of the discipline, the recording of it, and any relevant things that happened afterwards.",44,,
374,0.97,2969.733,2980.377,We broke it down to five or six categories and each one will have a slide in this presentation that we will talk about.,44,,
375,0.97,2980.377,2990.12,The chart here on the right is kind of representing all the disciplinary actions that happened within the scope of our audit.,44,,
376,0.97,2990.12,2996.159,We have a brief summary here of these things we came up with.,44,,
377,0.97,2996.159,3028.859,"We noted that there were these really adverse circumstances that I think are the greatest concerns to the committee, such as a pattern of Arbitrators overturning the chief colors disciplinary findings and part of that is owed--as is represented in the chart, a lot of cases, some are being fought for arbitration, but not many are being read by the Arbitrator or by Arbitrators.",44,,
378,0.97,3028.859,3030.394,There is a backlog that is growing.,44,,
379,0.97,3030.394,3032.896,It is a little inconclusive on the impact.,44,,
380,0.97,3032.896,3054.851,"The other part that we noted is there is not a pattern of repeat offenders--repeat offenders of misconduct, essentially that they are able to escalate discipline and apply for Progressive discipline in most cases, if there is a repeat of misconduct.",44,,
381,0.97,3054.851,3070.567,"That said, our audit did find processes, along with some of the contract positions, to create some disparities in the system.",44,,
382,0.97,3070.567,3072.135,There is a wide variety of findings.,44,,
383,0.97,3072.135,3082.312,"Anyone of them on their own do not necessarily break the system, but I think taken collectively, they create a picture of a system that is in need of some improvement or has a lot of room for improvement.",44,,
384,0.97,3082.312,3090.187,They may not necessarily live up to the timeliness or fairness or consistency.,44,,
385,0.97,3090.187,3094.324,So now we will get into the actual findings.,44,,
386,0.97,3094.324,3100.163,"First, we start with a proposal and determination of discipline for those who might not be familiar with how the process works.",44,,
387,0.97,3100.163,3118.181,"The basic run of it is if the OPA director recommends some timing, that has been put forth to the disciplinary Committee, which is comprised of the employment counsel and the chain of command.",44,,
388,0.97,3118.181,3133.33,Úthey come to the consensus where they wind up coming to whether it should be sustained or reverted back to not sustained.,44,,
389,0.97,3133.33,3137.367,There is a process if they do not agree but it is seldom used and it seems to work.,44,,
390,0.97,3137.367,3153.416,"If it does wind up as a sustained finding, then there is a conversation about what the recommended level of discipline should be.",44,,
391,0.97,3153.583,3156.553,"Sometimes, it winds up as a direct recommendation, like a Reprimand or a determination.",44,,
392,0.97,3156.553,3163.026,"Sometimes there is a range and that is often the case with suspension, like a 1 to 5 day suspension range, or a range of 30 day suspension or termination.",44,,
393,0.97,3163.026,3175.438,"What we show on this graph on the right is where there is a range to achieve, there is, more often than not, of reference for minimum ranges.",44,,
394,0.97,3175.438,3184.948,"About half the time, it winds up being the minimum of the range.",44,,
395,0.97,3184.948,3187.951,"If it is a 125 day suspension, it will be a one-day suspension.",44,,
396,0.97,3187.951,3192.589,"If it is between suspension or termination, very rarely has the chief ever chosen termination in that case, within the day we have.",44,,
397,0.97,3192.589,3205.001,"That said, the data we had was predominantly--that is one caveat to it.",44,,
398,0.97,3205.001,3209.806,"However, they have not necessarily bucked the trend, as you can see from the chart.",44,,
399,0.97,3209.806,3238.301,"As far as what goes into this, I think it is difficult to say--I think it is a fair assessment that there is some role, where employees have the opportunity to meet with the chief before discipline is decided and either refute any allegations against them or acknowledge and apologize in some cases, and that can work to lower the disciplinary penalty as well.",44,,
400,0.97,3238.301,3244.841,We do not have a comment to make on the meetings themselves.,44,,
401,0.97,3244.841,3256.82,"Those are guaranteed through the labor law, however, where we do make a point in the audit they are not given the same opportunity and that might lead to some of this kind of tilt towards the bottom of the range.",44,,
402,0.97,3256.82,3281.244,"There is a provision in the county ordinance in which the director might make a recommendation that the chief meet with complaints to look at the validation or victim impact statement, to assess the severity of the potential misconduct.",44,,
403,0.97,3281.244,3286.75,"However, this mechanism has not been applied in the scope of our audit.",44,,
404,0.97,3286.75,3300.163,This is primarily because the director had a fairly narrow hint interpretation of when it is useful and applicable.,44,,
405,0.97,3300.163,3311.574,"Talking with the director, we reached an understanding this could be more properly applied that it has been, so we made a recommendation with the OPA director to work with the chief and have criteria--not every complainant can meet with the chief.",44,,
406,0.97,3311.574,3321.851,"Logistically, that would be impossible, but there are instances where it could be useful for the chief to meet with Complainants and hear about the impact misconduct has had on them.",44,,
407,0.97,3321.851,3353.483,"I recall the report--there was a case--Okay, we're going to meet before the end of 2021, to consistently identify opportunities for Complainants to speak, as provided in the accountability ordinance--do you know if that has happened yet?",45,,
408,0.97,3353.483,3355.652,I do not know that has happened yet.,46,,
409,0.97,3355.652,3356.686,I have not checked in yet.,46,,
410,0.97,3356.686,3361.524,"We have not gone through--for all of our recommendations, generally, we have not gone through a formal check in yet.",46,,
411,0.97,3361.524,3384.247,"A quick question about the number of disciplinary actions represented by this particular analysis, 49 disciplinary actions? I thought I remember seeing on the previous page that you were looking at about upwards of 200 disciplinary actions.",47,,
412,0.97,3384.247,3391.688,"Maybe I misread that number but if not, I'm wondering why, for this exercise, you have only done a Subset.",47,,
413,0.97,3391.688,3396.993,The 268 was the total population.,48,,
414,0.97,3396.993,3408.338,"We did testing on, I think, a statistically valid sample of 159 of those cases for actual testing, multiple test for the audit.",48,,
415,0.97,3408.338,3422.986,"Within that 159, there were 49 in which there were a recommended range.",48,,
416,0.97,3422.986,3426.289,"Now, that means the rest of them came out as just a straightforward recommendations.",48,,
417,0.97,3426.289,3427.457,"A lot of times, those were Reprimands.",48,,
418,0.97,3427.457,3428.958,They usually do not count as ranges.,48,,
419,0.97,3428.958,3430.427,This is what the chief was presented with.,48,,
420,0.97,3430.427,3440.804,Thank you so much.,49,,
421,0.97,3441.471,3445.642,Another part that we talked about in the audit is the role of promotional considerations on the formation of discipline.,49,,
422,0.97,3445.642,3465.662,"In some cases, we observed the folks who were coming up with a recommendation would give some consideration to whether, if it is sustained, if they sustain on a allegation of misconduct, would this impact the officer's face future promotion potential?",49,,
423,0.97,3465.662,3466.896,I'm not talking about serious misconduct.,49,,
424,0.97,3466.896,3470.667,That would affect someone's promotion and should.,49,,
425,0.97,3470.667,3477.707,This is for something where we are straddling the line if it will be sustained or not.,49,,
426,0.97,3477.707,3490.653,"Sometimes--if we give this person a Reprimand, is this going to derail their future and is it worth doing that to them?",49,,
427,0.97,3490.653,3506.302,"So we took that concern and we looked back at the promotional Rosters, going from 2010 forward and found there was not any evidence that employees with minor misconduct, Reprimands, or even--that they were being passed over on the promotional roster.",49,,
428,0.97,3506.302,3512.842,"So that is not something we are making a judgment on, to what level discipline should be considered in the chief's promotional considerations.",49,,
429,0.97,3512.842,3517.981,"That was outside of what our audit, what our ballpark is.",49,,
430,0.97,3517.981,3533.53,What we did want to do is NOTE for those performing the disciplinary recommendation that there is something for the potential impact it might have when it does not manifest so much for the minor misconduct.,49,,
431,0.97,3533.53,3535.431,There you take a look at that question.,50,,
432,0.97,3535.431,3541.17,I appreciate that was out of the scope of this audit.,50,,
433,0.97,3541.17,3560.29,"They have done a pretty deep dive into the disciplinary history, complaint history of 101 police officers and the police Department, that have a history of multiple complaints.",50,,
434,0.97,3560.29,3577.507,I am just wondering--how might we take a look at that question of whether or not prior discipline should be a factor in promotions?,50,,
435,0.97,3577.507,3584.347,"Do you have any comments, Lisa?",51,,
436,0.97,3584.347,3586.015,"Yeah, I would be happy to weigh in.",52,,
437,0.97,3586.015,3619.182,"This is really our first attempted to go into SPD discipline systems and start turning rocks over and, Councilmember, what you identifying is this is not the end of this work, and his work does necessarily raise additional questions that need to be looked at and I think the one you are raising is probably--it is important to the community and something that is on our radar as well.",52,,
438,0.97,3619.182,3624.721,"The question that you are asking is one we need to sit down and talk about how we would approach that problem, how we would scope it out.",52,,
439,0.97,3624.721,3630.226,I think what you're identifying is your future work.,52,,
440,0.97,3630.226,3631.294,I hope that helps you.,52,,
441,0.97,3631.294,3631.861,It does.,53,,
442,0.97,3631.861,3640.37,I appreciate that.,53,,
443,0.97,3640.37,3648.811,And then the last part of the slide is what I would start in with the summary findings.,54,,
444,0.97,3648.811,3678.141,"The department does generally account for repeat misconduct for individual officers, were there is repeated misconduct and they will typically note that repeated misconduct is an aggregating finder--now, we do also no limitations exist in this, primarily because OPA investigations can take so long, and the disciplinary process can take some time, too.",54,,
445,0.97,3678.141,3710.273,"If you have an instance where--the first misconduct happens and discipline in that case is not awarded at the time, that the second misconduct happens--there is a little overlap, and there can be--essentially, it it might be a judgment call by the chief on whether or not to raise the disciplinary penalty at that point, even though discipline in the first case has not been finally awarded.",54,,
446,0.97,3710.273,3716.045,That has some hazard when it comes to appeals.,54,,
447,0.97,3716.045,3718.881,It is not a hard and fast rule that they cannot do it.,54,,
448,0.97,3718.881,3726.456,"We have seen were the second instance of misconduct was egregious enough that they did elevate the discipline, even when the first case had not yet been awarded.",54,,
449,0.97,3726.456,3729.392,That was one limitation we wanted to note that popped up with some frequency.,54,,
450,0.97,3729.392,3734.931,Next up is--accountability for minor violations.,54,,
451,0.97,3734.931,3744.74,This is essentially the use of Nonsustained training referrals and what happens with those.,54,,
452,0.97,3744.74,3753.483,They are within the audit and there were more of them.,54,,
453,0.97,3753.483,3768.397,"Within this group of our audit--these rules are typically minor, technical violations and oftentimes they are things that are either undisputed, or they were found with evidence they had.",54,,
454,0.97,3768.397,3770.5,The chart represents a kind of where these come from.,54,,
455,0.97,3770.5,3775.605,"Oftentimes, it is professionalism.",54,,
456,0.97,3775.605,3784.814,"In car body Video is also something, were the officer Forgets to activate the Video and maybe they noted it themselves and Self-Report and try to remedy it.",54,,
457,0.97,3784.814,3797.76,"We do not necessarily in OPA's eyes meet a penalty, but need to be addressed in some way.",54,,
458,0.97,3797.76,3813.776,"So, we felt this was confusing in some regard, to have a large question of violations of policy that are found to have happened, but your calling them not sustained.",54,,
459,0.97,3813.776,3820.883,"Typically, sustained means you prove it happened and not sustained means to varying degrees you could not prove it happened.",54,,
460,0.97,3820.883,3825.354,We took a look at other agencies.,54,,
461,0.97,3825.354,3837.433,"We did a small survey of eight other law enforcement agencies and found they all come to some extent, for these kind of minor violation policy, it had a Categorization that was sustained with no discipline or sustained training referral or sustained Admonishment.",54,,
462,0.97,3837.433,3845.708,They are all sustained.,54,,
463,0.97,3845.708,3873.135,"So SPD and OPA used it to use that kind of a designation until about 2018 and then, according to the OPA director and he is plenty counsel, they received a series of grievances from Spog, essentially in their accounting of it, it was principle of not wanting this particular run of the disciplinary ladder to be used.",54,,
464,0.97,3873.135,3884.213,"So they said, Okay, we will stop using that and instead will make these minor violations a sustained Reprimand or drop it down into a not sustained training referral.",54,,
465,0.97,3884.213,3901.464,"Now, that creates the issue that I talked about, with it it happened, your calling it Nonsustained, but another way we took this, that we also had concerned with was the reporting of those violations by virtue of being not sustained.",54,,
466,0.97,3901.464,3905.101,They are reported differently than another finding.,54,,
467,0.97,3905.101,3913.876,They do it at the CDA.,54,,
468,0.97,3913.876,3921.851,The Nonsustained findings that follow off of those cannot be put in the employ's appraisal.,54,,
469,0.97,3921.851,3923.886,It does not roll into the year end performance appraisal.,54,,
470,0.97,3923.886,3926.255,That is where all the other conversations happened.,54,,
471,0.97,3926.255,3952.548,"Instead, these conversations are recorded in the case management system, which is fine for the routing of these training referrals and the training of completion, but it is a black box, as it concerns the discipline and the visibility of future supervisors who might need to know if there is a pattern of minor misconduct.",54,,
472,0.97,3952.548,3957.52,"So, generally, it was inconsistent recording practices that we noted as well, with these training referrals.",54,,
473,0.97,3957.52,3974.971,"That said, we did NOTE recently that there was a sustained finding with no discipline.",54,,
474,0.97,3974.971,3978.24,"I think in November, it was issued, the first one we have seen since 2018.",54,,
475,0.97,3978.24,3981.143,"That may signal a change in posture, that these might be back in use again.",54,,
476,0.97,3981.143,3982.878,I do not have a conclusion on that.,54,,
477,0.97,3982.878,3990.086,You are identifying it as a Ke matter for consideration but do not have a specific recommendation on it?,54,,
478,0.97,3990.086,4014.276,"I thought I remembered hearing either from Inspector General judge or outgoing OPA director Meyer that there is an acknowledgment of this issue and intention to make a change, but I might be remembering incorrectly.",54,,
479,0.97,4014.276,4038.267,"Even if I am, I would like to understand what your expectations are when you identify something, remedial action, something as a matter for consideration.",54,,
480,0.97,4038.267,4039.468,Yeah.,55,,
481,0.97,4039.468,4046.142,"So in making something a matter for consideration, generally, those are--we have a decent amount of those in the report.",55,,
482,0.97,4046.142,4067.496,They are typically things that might be matters that are subject to collective bargaining or matters for which there has to be a decision by a policymaker that is not something that we necessarily feel comfortable in proposing our recommendation on how to fix it.,55,,
483,0.97,4067.496,4084.814,"We do make a recommendation on this, this group, a collection of findings, is in the recording of the training referrals, that they need to be brought into the same place as other conversations, in a matter that is transparent and Viewable to everybody who needs to see it.",55,,
484,0.97,4084.814,4094.156,They are kind of Segmented for no good reason right now.,55,,
485,0.97,4094.156,4116.846,"So, in that area, where there is an operational recommendation that makes sense and is supported by our findings, will make a recommendation, however, where there is an areas such as--how do you best address these minor violations of policy that are kind of dropping, dropping down the ladder right now and not being held accountable for discipline or performance appraisals.",55,,
486,0.97,4116.846,4136.398,"I think that is a question for the city and for OPA, and possibly collective bargaining, depending on what--how they want to handle the grievances that they follow from.",55,,
487,0.97,4136.398,4198.727,"I thought I remembered hearing some speculation as well, that the use of the sustained--I am sorry, not sustained training referral finding in instances where there is evidence that the violation actually occurred, that the use of that finding either through intent or by accident, results in what you mentioned earlier, Dan, results in a pattern of reduced Arbitrations because it is not something that can be appealed, and we have seen, I think, a reduced number of things being appealed.",56,,
488,0.97,4198.727,4211.473,"Since the use of this finding, it is compared to under previous directors who might have been more willing to make disciplinary findings that were appealed.",56,,
489,0.97,4211.473,4248.41,"I am sort of flagging that as another potential consequence of the use of the finding, and just Lastly, the reason why I am asking what the significance is or what the expectation is of the Oag when they identify something as a matter of considerations, I am wondering how you treat it in your Tracker for looking back, to see whether or not there has been action.",56,,
490,0.97,4248.41,4263.192,"And that Department or OPA just say, we considered it and decided to do nothing?",56,,
491,0.97,4272.534,4274.27,"Yeah, Lisa, do you want to take this?",57,,
492,0.97,4274.27,4275.27,I tell you what.,58,,
493,0.97,4275.27,4277.539,Why don't you start and I will fill in any gaps.,58,,
494,0.97,4277.539,4281.71,"Typically, matters for consideration are not something that are--that have the same follow-up as a recommendation does.",59,,
495,0.97,4281.71,4288.15,"I am not certain with our office, I am not certain if we have an established practice for tracking the matters for consideration.",59,,
496,0.97,4288.15,4303.766,"I think this audit is a little bit novel in the volume of matters for consideration that we have in it, but typically there is not the same follow-up and validation testing.",59,,
497,0.97,4303.766,4307.703,"That is really key for the recommendations, that we go back and we validate what actions they took.",59,,
498,0.97,4307.703,4312.174,So there would not be that piece at the very least.,59,,
499,0.97,4312.174,4312.775,Thanks.,60,,
500,0.97,4312.775,4324.553,"I think I would just add to that that, you know, we are new and some of these, as Dan said, are novel for us.",60,,
501,0.97,4324.553,4362.391,"We are still establishing how will will do follow up on things that are hard audit recommendations, and this highlights a bit of a challenge of having a hybrid office that uses, for some of his work, the standards with the R recommendation supported by quality controlled data, which is something that is within our realm of authority to make recommendations on and these issues we think are potentially significant, some we know are significant, but are kind of outside of that scope of our authority.",60,,
502,0.97,4362.391,4365.094,We are highlighting these policymakers that have alluded to that.,60,,
503,0.97,4365.094,4381.577,"No, there is not follow up in the hard government yellow book sense but there is an accountability Tracker that is maintained by the partners and by CPC.",60,,
504,0.97,4381.577,4384.279,We also maintain a list of all of the things we do.,60,,
505,0.97,4384.279,4402.865,"You know, there can be follow up but the follow-up that we do on this, as mentioned, some of it is largely related to some bargaining issues and some policy issues that might need to be made on the part of the counselor of the apartment director.",60,,
506,0.97,4402.865,4403.899,That way we can follow up.,60,,
507,0.97,4403.899,4414.977,"But the magnitude of these kinds of things, the import of these matters for consideration, is willing to put a flag on them for policymakers.",60,,
508,0.97,4414.977,4415.444,I hope that helps.,60,,
509,0.97,4415.444,4417.846,Thank you.,61,,
510,0.97,4417.846,4421.683,"Okay, thank you.",62,,
511,0.97,4421.683,4424.486,The next area is the enforcement of discipline.,62,,
512,0.97,4424.486,4433.829,We found that suspensions were not served timely or consistently.,62,,
513,0.97,4433.829,4446.074,"So, in most workplaces, if you have a suspension for 30 days, then you are just out the next 30 workdays.",62,,
514,0.97,4446.074,4447.776,"However, it is not so simple with SPD.",62,,
515,0.97,4447.776,4466.228,"Due to some practical considerations, such as minimum staffing levels, but then there is also a clause that potentially says you cannot drop somebody below half-time in a given pay period or in a month because of their Healthcare and pension benefits, because those would be negatively affected.",62,,
516,0.97,4466.228,4472.401,"Because of those, there is this need to chunk up suspensions, some longer suspensions sometimes.",62,,
517,0.97,4472.401,4491.22,"The apartment Department says, on suspension orders, you have to serve a suspension within two pay periods from the time it is ordered if you have to chunk it up, make it between two pay periods.",62,,
518,0.97,4491.22,4493.722,"Otherwise, it needs to be authorized by the director of H hr.",62,,
519,0.97,4493.722,4518.013,"We found come in our audit, that it was not happening and the controls are generally around the assignment of suspension dates was a fairly lax and this led to some suspensions being extended far beyond that two pay period threshold, where we found a few suspensions that were spread to as much as 10 pay periods.",62,,
520,0.97,4518.013,4526.588,There are a couple that were 30 day suspensions and that would equal three days served every two weeks.,62,,
521,0.97,4526.588,4543.805,"So, this was--this creates a consideration about timeliness of the service of suspension, as well as kind of--what is the accountability if you were able to spread out the penalty of that suspension?",62,,
522,0.97,4543.805,4571.9,"Adding on to that, and this is what you see--while employees are not allowed to work overtime or take voluntary overtime shifts, on the days when they are suspended, there is nothing stopping them from taking overtime shifts on all the other days of the pay period.",62,,
523,0.97,4571.9,4577.205,"If you are suspended three days in a pay period, you can find overtime shifts on the other seven days and, to some extent, offset that penalty.",62,,
524,0.97,4577.205,4579.408,"If you have a two day suspension, it is one thing.",62,,
525,0.97,4579.408,4583.845,You could probably pick up overtime shifts in your next pay period or offset it to some extent.,62,,
526,0.97,4583.845,4594.957,"When you line up the 30 day suspension that is spread over 10 pay periods, you wind up--it is a lot easier to offset those suspension days with overtime the further that you extended out.",62,,
527,0.97,4594.957,4599.227,That is kind of demonstrated that these are all individuals suspensions on this chart.,62,,
528,0.97,4599.227,4611.606,"There is H, J, and K that pop up, instances where the suspension was served almost, factored in as an overtime rate.",62,,
529,0.97,4611.606,4619.114,They were able to make up the hours.,62,,
530,0.97,4619.114,4633.862,So I--this is not quite what you imagine the accountability might look like with a suspension.,62,,
531,0.97,4633.862,4640.402,"It might not meet the public's expectation of what a suspension shall look like and would be in most other professions, I believe.",62,,
532,0.97,4640.402,4658.687,"We made recommendations that the Department tighten up their controls related to the authorization of these suspensions, so you do not have this suspensions that are extended far beyond what it needs to be, and then we also recommended that they prohibit the accrual of overtime--the role of until that suspension is completed.",62,,
533,0.97,4658.687,4673.902,But the Department felt that latter recommendation was something that would be subject to collective darkening.,62,,
534,0.97,4673.902,4675.837,The next area we looked at was disciplinary records.,62,,
535,0.97,4675.837,4680.342,"In short, there were 23% of disciplinary action reports in the scope of our audit.",62,,
536,0.97,4680.342,4683.979,We are not in personnel files.,62,,
537,0.97,4683.979,4689.751,This was most pronounced with the group of employees that retired prior to discipline.,62,,
538,0.97,4689.751,4698.727,"That is unfortunate because they are most likely to have a second unemployment check, if they went to another Department.",62,,
539,0.97,4698.727,4726.555,"So this has a negative check on employment of anyone seeking employment on disciplinary action actions in a personnel file, where you might expect to see disciplinary actions and the personal file . history of this also has an impact on public disclosure request as well.",62,,
540,0.97,4726.555,4730.392,"If someone is not seeking this through OPA, then it could potentially be missing in the personal file.",62,,
541,0.97,4730.392,4734.029,It is important to note that they have the records of these disciplinary actions that were missing.,62,,
542,0.97,4734.029,4735.63,We are just talking about the personnel file.,62,,
543,0.97,4735.63,4750.579,"This was a process from as far as we can tell--we recommended that the Department Úgo back into a more comprehensive audit of all actions that happened from 2018, moving forward.",62,,
544,0.97,4750.579,4756.418,"Sorry, I Unmuted --",62,,
545,0.97,4756.418,4773.101,The recommendation to address this finding--can this be done after the fact?,63,,
546,0.97,4773.101,4782.344,"Can they go back and put things in the disciplinary files of people who have already left, if they identify that being missing?",63,,
547,0.97,4782.344,4791.553,"I am not aware of any reason why they would not be able to go back in and insert the files, with speaking with the hr director.",64,,
548,0.97,4791.553,4794.956,It seems like they were going back and Remedying the files that we found missing.,64,,
549,0.97,4794.956,4796.391,It should be in there.,65,,
550,0.97,4796.391,4804.766,It just was not filed in the folder.,65,,
551,0.97,4804.766,4804.966,Yeah.,65,,
552,0.97,4804.966,4808.77,Thank you.,66,,
553,0.97,4808.77,4831.259,"Would it be reasonable to expect the Department to contact individuals who had sought personnel evaluations or recommendations in the hiring process, to let them know that there is additional information that was not provided when asked?",66,,
554,0.97,4831.259,4846.374,Or would that be cumbersome for someone at SPD to undertake?,66,,
555,0.97,4846.374,4847.008,Red.,67,,
556,0.97,4847.008,4860.188,I was going to say I think that is probably a question for SPD to answer about what that looks like and what Record-Keeping they have of agencies that have kind come in and on the checks.,67,,
557,0.97,4860.188,4861.556,We can certainly find out for you.,67,,
558,0.97,4861.556,4865.36,Thank you.,68,,
559,0.97,4865.36,4870.065,"Another piece on this slide, there was a gap, somewhat--out.",68,,
560,0.97,4870.065,4884.579,There was a gap in the Department submitting Notifications of Disqualifying conduct from the Ctjc.,68,,
561,0.97,4884.579,4908.27,"Usually, it there was Disqualifying behavior . to the Department's credit, they did find this existed before the start of our art it and they refiled revised Notifications to the Cjtc.",68,,
562,0.97,4908.27,4913.108,"Going in late 2020 and 2021, it seems the process is working initially as it should.",68,,
563,0.97,4913.108,4933.895,"For the folks who were not initially--they were delayed with Notifications, we checked with Cjtc and they were pending review and none of them, according to Cjtc records, none of them were employed as police officers at the time.",68,,
564,0.97,4933.895,4937.565,That is helpful.,69,,
565,0.97,4937.565,4939.868,Thank you.,69,,
566,0.97,4939.868,4944.839,Communication was another big area we looked at.,70,,
567,0.97,4944.839,4960.121,"For those of you unfamiliar Úwith whose goal it is, it is OPA to contact Complainants and let them know that case status and the appeals happen.",70,,
568,0.97,4960.121,4991.82,"It was, I think, due to some process and maybe a lack of emphasis when OPA started to get overloaded with some cases, that there was a few--they did not quite make expectations on a lot of It.,--complaints were knowing about--two or three months after the case was finalized, after the chief had issued discipline.",70,,
569,0.97,4991.82,4994.823,They were not notifying Complainants from 2016 to 220 20.,70,,
570,0.97,4994.823,4998.493,There were no appeals action.,70,,
571,0.97,4998.493,5010.505,"They also did not have a process for identifying Complainants, identifying individuals who are the subject of police misconduct, but are not Complainants.",70,,
572,0.97,5010.505,5018.446,"This might look like a supervisor or a review board, sing an instance of misconduct.",70,,
573,0.97,5018.446,5044.239,Opa would then code those as the complainant and the person that was subject to the misconduct would not be classified as the Complainants in most cases and would not receive the resulting communications that they usually do.,70,,
574,0.97,5044.239,5047.375,"In some cases, they might not even be aware the case involving them exists at all.",70,,
575,0.97,5047.375,5053.481,We made recommendations to OPA on all three of these and they were very receptive and are hopefully going to remedy all of those in very short order.,70,,
576,0.97,5053.481,5059.587,And then the last area we get into with the audit is arbitration and appeals.,70,,
577,0.97,5059.587,5068.763,"As we said at the start, with that diagram, there have not been a lot of Appeals action.",70,,
578,0.97,5068.763,5074.836,You must know cases have gone there in the last few years.,70,,
579,0.97,5074.836,5076.871,This is due to a couple of legitimate reasons.,70,,
580,0.97,5076.871,5098.827,They took some time and they cases had to be reassigned to Arbitrators and then Arbitrators with the city and Spog did not feel like some of the cases were conducive to virtual hearings.,70,,
581,0.97,5098.827,5100.895,So there has been some delays on that end.,70,,
582,0.97,5100.895,5108.069,"However, what we discussed in the audit as underlying it all is the controls for timeliness has a gap in it.",70,,
583,0.97,5108.069,5133.194,"There is a Timeline for when they must be selected and after the Arbitrators notified--you can have cases sit for an indeterminate amount of time, where the Arbitrator has been selected, but not notified of their selection and they have no idea they have been selected.",70,,
584,0.97,5133.194,5143.137,This describes almost all of the cases that are on the backlog of cases rating for arbitration.,70,,
585,0.97,5143.137,5147.108,"There is about 80 some cases, part of 80 cases of disciplinary actions that are currently pending.",70,,
586,0.97,5147.108,5176.504,"Both the city and--they can kick off the scheduling, but the CIT SEES it as Spog's responsibility because the grievances are owned by Spog and the discipline has already been enforced . So the city, in most cases, does not reason to initiate these arbitration hearings.",70,,
587,0.97,5176.504,5191.519,"We did speak with some Spog representatives and they did not articulate any real reason why these Arbitrators have not been contacted but they did express their members do ask sometimes, what is asking with my case?",70,,
588,0.97,5191.519,5192.554,Can we get this cleared?,70,,
589,0.97,5192.554,5200.528,I think there is fairness and timeliness issues for Complainants and employees.,70,,
590,0.97,5200.528,5202.764,They should not be languishing for years before they are resolved.,70,,
591,0.97,5202.764,5210.338,I think that is in everybody's interest to have a timely resolution.,70,,
592,0.97,5210.338,5221.482,"So that is something we are flagging, again, not making a recommendation because it is subject to collective bargaining, but we are Flacking for negotiations and hopefully they can be tighter in the future, in the future contract.",70,,
593,0.97,5221.482,5223.718,Another issue that we are flagging is the Arbitrator selection process.,70,,
594,0.97,5223.718,5248.109,It is not necessarily--especially in the Spog agreement . I will be careful in saying we did not observe any kind of manipulation of the roster or specific gaming of it.,70,,
595,0.97,5248.109,5256.384,"There has not been enough cases that have gone through the standard selection process to really draw that conclusion, however, in looking in the process itself, the main issue is there is not randomization of the roster after each selection.",70,,
596,0.97,5256.384,5269.964,"Because there is eliminated processes and cases are heard on the first come, first serve basis, to a limited extent, you can make selections in one case with an I to which person will make the next case.",70,,
597,0.97,5269.964,5275.903,That is something we would hope would also be tightened up in the next contract.,70,,
598,0.97,5275.903,5284.946,And then the last piece that we had here is we took a look at the safety Commission.,70,,
599,0.97,5284.946,5297.592,They were specified as--that was rolled back after collective bargaining.,70,,
600,0.97,5297.592,5326.287,"We wanted to point out while they are preferable to labor arbitration for transparency and perhaps even timeliness and maybe even Democratic accountability, they--there is nothing in the rules that necessarily makes them give a different standard of review from an Arbitrator selected through the process.",70,,
601,0.97,5326.287,5349.644,"We concluded that the three commissioners that make up that group are equally capable, maybe not as likely, but equally capable of applying their own, their own interpretation on the reviews that they conduct as an individual Arbitrator could do themselves.",70,,
602,0.97,5349.644,5358.219,"That is the burden of proof--whether it is and you is, what evidence can be heard during those hearings, and more.",70,,
603,0.97,5358.219,5384.679,"There might be some light practice of giving deference to the chief on that site, but there is not really anything that locks them into, say, not being able to look at the discipline and feel like that was too strict and we would like to roll that back in the same way you saw happen with the Shepard case.",70,,
604,0.97,5384.679,5386.547,And then there is also issues with capacity.,70,,
605,0.97,5386.547,5392.52,"If they were ever to hear all of the backlog of Appeals, they would have issues with how to do that.",70,,
606,0.97,5392.52,5405.066,"So that concludes the main findings that we are going to discuss, and the slide was other findings that were in the report, that it felt like we do not have time for.",70,,
607,0.97,5405.066,5422.517,"If the Council members have reviewed the materials before hand or see anything on this list here that is of interest, I am happy to talk about them as well or we can double back to anything we mentioned in the presentation.",70,,
608,0.97,5422.517,5423.117,Thank you.,71,,
609,0.97,5423.117,5428.523,Looking to see whether or not there are any questions from counsel colleagues.,72,,
610,0.97,5428.523,5436.464,I am recognizing that a President Morris has joined us.,72,,
611,0.97,5436.464,5444.839,I really appreciate you being with us.,72,,
612,0.97,5444.839,5449.343,I'm not seeing any additional raised hands or questions.,73,,
613,0.97,5449.343,5460.421,I do want to go back on one--thank you.,73,,
614,0.97,5460.421,5467.061,"Thank you Inspector generals, Dan fetes, for your approach.",74,,
615,0.97,5467.061,5477.004,"This is very important work and looking at the data, as you have done, it is really important to support your conclusions.",74,,
616,0.97,5477.004,5507.101,"I think for the public, the public that is listening to this, you do have a 47 page report and I want to read a little bit of your conclusion from that because I think it is important, where you say this audit found current processes and practices come alongside collective bargaining and Spog have created gaps in the discipline system.",74,,
617,0.97,5507.101,5517.144,This impacted the timeliness and consistency and transparency of discipline for individual officers and diminished transparency and fairness for community members affected by police misconduct.,74,,
618,0.97,5517.144,5523.618,"I think, you know, I support hiring more community policeman officers.",74,,
619,0.97,5523.618,5524.785,I think they are Understaffed.,74,,
620,0.97,5524.785,5534.729,"At the same time, I think consistent--there is a cause for a stronger collective bargaining agreement that implements the Twentysomething accountability ordinance.",74,,
621,0.97,5534.729,5543.137,I feel that some of the findings that you made could be implemented by SPD management right away.,74,,
622,0.97,5543.137,5570.898,"I think there is good information in here that management could use to enhance how they work with employees that are subject to misconduct, and I hope they use this as a guidebook immediately, and then the collective bargaining agreement expired a year and a half ago",74,,
623,0.97,5570.898,5577.672,The newly formed committee has not met yet.,75,,
624,0.97,5577.672,5581.709,"I was recently appointed to that, so I look forward to being on the inside of that negotiation.",75,,
625,0.97,5581.709,5590.518,"That way, we can get a product that is timely, fair, consistent, and transparent.",75,,
626,0.97,5590.518,5597.191,"We talked about public safety, the heart of it really lies in the contract.",75,,
627,0.97,5597.191,5600.728,I'm looking forward to that and I appreciate these audit findings to help guide that book.,75,,
628,0.97,5600.728,5601.128,Thank you.,75,,
629,0.97,5601.128,5603.531,"Thank you, Councilmember Alex Pedersen.",76,,
630,0.97,5603.531,5609.87,"To that point, I wanted to say two things.",76,,
631,0.97,5609.87,5631.092,"One, as it relates, looking back at this question of matters for consideration versus a finding, I think I heard you say that this is something that might be a topic of ongoing conversation about how you classify these things.",76,,
632,0.97,5631.092,5632.994,That is a conversation I would like to have.,76,,
633,0.97,5632.994,5649.644,"I do not know that the fact something has to be bargained, or the fact that it is up to policymakers to make a policy change would necessitate not issuing a finding.",76,,
634,0.97,5649.644,5663.057,"If you look at, for instance, the city auditors Website, there are plenty of findings that are findings for counsel to act on and they track them.",76,,
635,0.97,5663.057,5690.117,"I think we all want to be held accountable as well, to acting on things that are recommendations for policy changes and as it related specifically to the bargaining process, I know the public wants the folks who are involved in the bargaining process to be held accountable for addressing items not just in the Twentysomething accountability ordinance, but coming up through ongoing analysis and review, like your Audits.",76,,
636,0.97,5690.117,5721.515,"For the viewing public, Councilmember Alex Pedersen mentioned the role of the group made a five Council members and the executive, but we also have a role carved out as advisers for the Oig, the OPA, and the CPC, to help us make sure we are bringing these very items to the table.",76,,
637,0.97,5721.515,5731.258,I just want to make sure that we are creating all of these mechanisms for accountability.,76,,
638,0.97,5731.258,5744.271,"There is a very, very, very large menu of items, both legislative items, along with darkening items, that I think are really, really important to keep track of.",76,,
639,0.97,5744.271,5760.387,"I think this is a really fantastic body of work year and I do not want to lose track of the important recommendations, regardless of the Venue or method that it takes to implement the recommendations.",76,,
640,0.97,5760.387,5763.124,"Thank you, Chairperson Herbold.",77,,
641,0.97,5763.124,5770.03,"Thank you, Council President.",77,,
642,0.97,5770.03,5771.499,Those are all the points well taken.,77,,
643,0.97,5771.499,5793.187,"Some of the matters for consideration, the basis for designating it that is there is not necessarily a factual basis to support a belief there is a deficiency or a problem, but we are flagging there is a fairly high potential for an issue.",77,,
644,0.97,5793.187,5793.787,Reasons for this.,77,,
645,0.97,5793.787,5807.468,"I totally am in complete agreement with your concerns and with making sure that we track these in some way, where there is meaningful accountability as we move forward.",77,,
646,0.97,5807.468,5817.945,"Dan, do you want to say anything in sort of just to fill in some information for Councilmember Pedersen and the public and the Committee on SPD's responses?",77,,
647,0.97,5817.945,5830.057,I think they--they submit responses to our audit findings.,77,,
648,0.97,5830.057,5834.128,"It would be interesting for the committee and the public to hear a bit about that, if we have time.",77,,
649,0.97,5834.128,5846.34,"Yeah, the responses to the recommendations from SPD--they concurred with all the recommendations we made to them, except for the one about overtime.",78,,
650,0.97,5846.34,5855.416,They neither concurred or not concurred because they thought it was a matter for collective bargaining.,78,,
651,0.97,5855.416,5887.848,"However, on all the accounts, with implementation plans, with the date they would have to target, dates for completion of that implementation and once we reach those dates, we do not have quite enough time at this point after the conclusion of the item--might slow things down a bit in terms of wanting to give people a chance to breathe.",78,,
652,0.97,5887.848,5894.855,"Sometime earlier this year, by quarter one, we will to follow up and we intend to do formal Úfollow-Up with SPD and OPA and recommendations for others.",78,,
653,0.97,5894.855,5916.543,"With all of those entities to try and understand if their plans have gone as they had expected them to and if so, we will conduct validation testing on that.",78,,
654,0.97,5916.543,5918.679,"If not, we can discuss further.",78,,
655,0.97,5918.679,5944.405,"Sometimes, recommendations cannot be taken the way they were exactly intended, so you try to be very prescriptive in the way you write a recommendation but it always helps to have that kind of follow-up conversation, which has not been had yet, to make sure we are on the same page and that we are achieving what we set out to.",78,,
656,0.97,5944.405,5947.675,Thank you.,79,,
657,0.97,5947.675,5949.777,We have that background moving forward.,79,,
658,0.97,5949.777,5956.617,"All right, looking to see if there are any final thoughts or questions.",79,,
659,0.97,5956.617,5962.356,I am not seeing any.,79,,
660,0.97,5962.356,5973.867,"Really, again, I am very appreciative of your work and looking forward to our ongoing conversations about this ongoing body of work.",79,,

669,0.97,6003.597,6018.712,"Many investments that Hsd has announced for 2022 are specific to address the impact of the pandemic on our mental health, which I have often referred to as the shadow pandemic.",83,,
670,0.97,6018.712,6027.988,We have the fear and pain and isolation of the Covid pandemic--they are leading to negative mental health impacts for many of us.,83,,
671,0.97,6027.988,6044.972,"All that points to the pandemic having a significant impact on our behavioral health and, Anecdotally, violence, Self- harm, abuse, assault, and other forms of violence.",83,,

768,0.97,6787.947,6794.921,I am excited to share more.,89,,
769,0.97,6794.921,6801.694,It will be releasing close to 12 million in funding for Gender-Based violence.,89,,
770,0.97,6801.694,6820.98,"$10.8 million will be released to specifically focus on gender based violence, including mobile advocacy, shelter and housing, therapeutic services, prevention, outreach and education, and other Wraparound response services.",89,,
771,0.97,6820.98,6831.324,The combination of these strategies is to Operationalize our vision of the approach to victim services and response and support cross collaboration and partnership among service providers.,89,,

774,0.97,6844.771,6866.426,It is a collaborative thing for partners and it is aimed at increasing safety through the implementation of a national and best practice model with court mandated intervention.,89,,
775,0.97,6866.426,6876.469,"One thing that is noted is most recently, they were awarded 1.5 million for four years for this project, so the total amount for this funding annually is 147 229, which will come from the fund and the other comes from the Federal Fund.",89,,

781,0.97,6915.808,6922.548,All the prior Rfp and Rfq that I mentioned are focus on services provided by social workers.,89,,
782,0.97,6922.548,6929.188,This particular Rfq is geared towards attorneys working with nonprofit legal programs and organizations.,89,,
783,0.97,6929.188,6932.659,So that is pretty much what we have in terms of Gender-Based violence for 2023.,89,,
784,0.97,6932.659,6937.83,One quick thing before we move on.,90,,
785,0.97,6937.83,6948.541,"The total funding available is for about $967,000, according to the slide.",90,,
786,0.97,6948.541,6961.988,"I am guessing from the scope, as described here, and the amount, this does not include the 1.5 million from advocacy services?",90,,
787,0.97,6961.988,6963.99,Not for survivors of Gender- based violence.,90,,
788,0.97,6963.99,6970.663,So how and when can we expect that to get out the door?,90,,
789,0.97,6970.663,6971.264,That is correct.,91,,
790,0.97,6971.264,6973.032,The $1.5 million is from slide number one.,91,,
791,0.97,6973.032,6977.57,The victim services includes Mfa.,91,,

793,0.97,7000.026,7002.495,You are not going to spend the full amount in 2022?,92,,
794,0.97,7002.495,7003.93,Is that what you are saying?,92,,
795,0.97,7003.93,7005.131,We hope to spend it out.,93,,
796,0.97,7005.131,7008.468,We are in the process of drafting amendments right now for 2022.,93,,
797,0.97,7008.468,7014.974,For contracts that are in place for services to be provided in 2022?,94,,
798,0.97,7014.974,7015.775,That is correct.,95,,
799,0.97,7015.775,7023.282,I was confused by your reference to 2023.,96,,
800,0.97,7023.282,7025.184,"In 2022, they will be having renewal contracts.",97,,
801,0.97,7025.184,7040.366,We are adding to existing contracts but most of our voters will be--this funding will be released in 2022 for 2023.,97,,
802,0.97,7040.366,7044.27,"The Rfp and the Rfq's that are going to be released in May, they are for 2023 contracts.",97,,
803,0.97,7044.27,7045.104,Sorry if --,97,,
804,0.97,7045.104,7047.673,Including the $1.5 million that the Council allocated for advocacy services?,98,,
805,0.97,7047.673,7053.613,They will not be available until 2023?,98,,
806,0.97,7053.613,7075.301,"So, that amount is available in 2022, in the form of contract amendments and all of our funding, pretty much all of it with the exception of one strategy will be Re-Released in 2022 for 2023.",99,,
807,0.97,7075.301,7078.805,They will be part of this packet of 10.8 million that will be released in 2023.,99,,
808,0.97,7078.805,7082.542,Might I say it in a different way?,100,,
809,0.97,7082.542,7115.174,"Sometimes, correct me if I am wrong, but just in general, when we receive cancel ads that are ongoing and it does not neatly lined up with an Rfq or Rft, what we will do to make sure we get the funds out the door quickly is we will do a direct add to existing investments and then line it up to the art of tea, so it can be competitively bid and the results of that will result in contracts.",100,,
810,0.97,7115.174,7117.176,"So, what we typically do--there are exceptions.",100,,
811,0.97,7117.176,7120.48,We have an Rfp in one year but it impacts the contracts for the following year.,100,,
812,0.97,7120.48,7150.042,"In order to utilize the ads that are given in 2022, what I think I'm hearing them say is to address the needs of 2022 and available funding, we will do the contract ads through the existing contracts and also line it up within this Rfp that we are about to release, which will then impact a new slate of contracts, which may or may not provide other providers in 2023.",100,,
813,0.97,7150.042,7150.643,Is that right?,100,,
814,0.97,7150.643,7151.477,That is correct.,101,,
815,0.97,7151.477,7151.911,Thank you.,102,,
816,0.97,7151.911,7153.646,That is consistent with the Council's expectation.,102,,
817,0.97,7153.646,7159.519,Thank you so much.,102,,
818,0.97,7159.519,7165.558,The community is interested and there is a need to get the money out the door.,103,,
819,0.97,7165.558,7179.539,The reason why it is in the amendment is because we want to take the time to look at the performance of contracts in 2020 and if folks are ready and are in this capacity to utilize that funding in 2022.,104,,
820,0.97,7179.539,7185.144,That is in process.,104,,
821,0.97,7185.144,7188.581,I just--this is a process question.,105,,
822,0.97,7188.581,7198.558,"Basically, when the Council passes the budget and if there are ads, they are somehow reflected in the Nofa we are looking at.",105,,
823,0.97,7198.558,7217.843,"Are you saying if there is not a new NOTE or a new Rfp, somehow that work that has been funded has been stuck onto some other providers that are doing works?",105,,
824,0.97,7217.843,7222.715,"If there is work that cannot be done, that would be a separate contract and it would be reflected here, right?",105,,
825,0.97,7222.715,7234.894,You have to scramble between budget and things to make sure the Council's priorities are reflected in the funding for the next year and for Nofa.,105,,
826,0.97,7234.894,7239.865,Is that pretty much --,105,,
827,0.97,7239.865,7240.466,Yes.,106,,
828,0.97,7240.466,7244.17,Yes and no.,107,,
829,0.97,7244.17,7249.375,The Council adds are really important to us.,107,,
830,0.97,7249.375,7271.53,"Sometimes, as you probably know, the ads are very specific, and so when there is specific, we have an idea of whether or not it is for an existing program and it really is more about doing an amendment and not for a request for a proposal.",107,,
831,0.97,7271.53,7292.318,"Generally, the best practices for us to have are qualifications, so we are allowing an organization to compete, especially when we know it is not so specialized that there is only one entity that is qualified to provide that service.",107,,
832,0.97,7292.318,7296.288,"We know there are two or more that Ideally are mirrored, doing competitive process.",107,,
833,0.97,7296.288,7315.374,"There are times where we have ads and, again, does not align with our scheduled Rfps that we need to review and see how we are going to implement them.",107,,
834,0.97,7315.374,7318.344,"Our process is, we get the ads and it is in the budget.",107,,
835,0.97,7318.344,7323.115,"We internally will assess--is this a direct add, which it rarely is.",107,,
836,0.97,7323.115,7325.418,Do we folded into an Rfp and doesn't lined up neatly?,107,,
837,0.97,7325.418,7329.555,"We will mitigate year one, so I can neatly tie into an Rfp that was planned.",107,,
838,0.97,7329.555,7340.366,We do not want to overburden organizations to write multiple Rfps for the same service area.,107,,
839,0.97,7340.366,7355.147,"Sometimes we have new sources of funds that do not line up, that requires another request proposal or a qualification.",107,,
840,0.97,7355.147,7360.319,"That is the caveat I gave earlier, which is, right now, what we are presenting to you, the ones we have plant in our budget.",107,,
841,0.97,7360.319,7362.588,It is possible that we have some ads with further analysis.,107,,
842,0.97,7362.588,7364.056,"For example, I will throw out one.",107,,
843,0.97,7364.056,7366.692,We have a study that is pretty significant with the dollar amount.,107,,
844,0.97,7366.692,7369.628,We need to do some kind of bidding process for that.,107,,
845,0.97,7369.628,7381.407,That is not noted here because Natalie and her team are likely to take that on after some planning.,107,,
846,0.97,7381.407,7393.686,"They will determine what is the appropriate path forward and will add it to the Nofa and then we will discuss the appropriate way in which we do the bids, and that will be in its own.",107,,
847,0.97,7393.686,7396.856,"That contract will likely start this year, and not wait until the following year.",107,,
848,0.97,7396.856,7398.691,"Sometimes, yes and no, it depends.",107,,
849,0.97,7398.691,7408.234,"And then for a follow-up, you mentioned that this can change over the year and if there are new funds that could become available.",108,,
850,0.97,7408.234,7434.794,It seems like the funding was in funding right away and if build back better passes and we know--there will be a lot of other work for you to do and you will assign that across the service area.,108,,
851,0.97,7434.794,7441.4,Do you have enough people to be--that you keep up with these surges?,108,,
852,0.97,7441.4,7443.002,Do you anticipate that being an issue?,108,,
853,0.97,7443.002,7451.343,Are you planning for a big chunk of work in anticipation for these external sources of funding becoming available?,108,,
854,0.97,7451.343,7454.513,I thank you for that question.,109,,
855,0.97,7454.513,7460.586,That could not have been better times.,109,,
856,0.97,7460.586,7491.35,"If--what we have learned throughout Covid and in years past with emerging issues, we are the Department with early support to provide these opportunities, but as we know, we are also an organization that are, frankly, community--we are organizers and social workers, people that have been doing this in the field and we are also an organization that needs to have capacity in order to do this well.",109,,
857,0.97,7491.35,7503.429,"We appreciate the partnership with not only CBO and counsel--we are able to prudently identify with the administrative costs are, and they also include our financial operation systems.",109,,
858,0.97,7503.429,7510.069,What does it take for Natalie to do an Rfp?,109,,
859,0.97,7510.069,7515.441,What does it take for us to provide technical assistance and really support organizations?,109,,
860,0.97,7515.441,7527.853,We do encourage a lot of emerging organizations and some that have wonderful infrastructure and some that do not.,109,,
861,0.97,7527.853,7530.022,We will provide that technical assistance with our grants and contracts.,109,,
862,0.97,7530.022,7536.795,We are pretty conservative.,109,,
863,0.97,7536.795,7543.202,"We have a committee of us that are a nonprofit but we need to shift getting out of this really super lien, where we are not offering the best services.",109,,
864,0.97,7543.202,7553.979,"We are coming up with the right, think, formula and discussion to see what it takes to responsibly be good stewards of public dollars, and how much can we pass to the community because we want to make sure the money is out the door, where it belongs.",109,,
865,0.97,7553.979,7559.351,We have negotiated that for some administrative Castes.,109,,
866,0.97,7559.351,7568.36,I think you for that question.,109,,
867,0.97,7568.36,7583.976,"So the last slide--thank you, Kevin, for reminding me--also on the Nofa, and the top, we really described what the funding opportunities are.",110,,
868,0.97,7583.976,7601.226,"We are giving folks notice that the request proposals, the full on application and guide will be published by certain dates and we do also offer a preview of the next year.",110,,
869,0.97,7601.226,7605.631,"Of course, we are in communication with our providers, as well as the general public about what is to come.",110,,
870,0.97,7605.631,7614.773,"Organizations can prepare, and so we have got queued up in 2023, again, this is our base budget and what we know today.",110,,
871,0.97,7614.773,7624.149,Our seniors centers and registered dietitian services for older adults and congregate meals for older adults and family support back in youth and family empowerment.,110,,
872,0.97,7624.149,7630.823,These are being queued up for the following year.,110,,
873,0.97,7630.823,7631.023,Yes?,110,,
874,0.97,7631.023,7633.192,A couple of things on the last slide.,111,,
875,0.97,7633.192,7651.777,"I want to highlight that I believe Hst is still conducting an analysis of the be able health needs available to Lgbtq young people and it is possible that funding might be available sometime this year for that purpose, depending on the results of the analysis.",111,,
876,0.97,7651.777,7666.358,It would be helpful to understand what the expected Timeline is for that work.,111,,
877,0.97,7666.358,7670.796,"Also, on the third program funding, I know many of the expected 2023 investments are in the area of food programs.",111,,
878,0.97,7670.796,7673.966,I want to also note that as part of the 2022 budget counsel.,111,,
879,0.97,7673.966,7683.676,Dte requested reports on the availability of additional funding for food and nutrition programs.,111,,
880,0.97,7683.676,7685.944,That is from the State Department of Agriculture this year.,111,,
881,0.97,7685.944,7688.013,That includes a proposal for how these funds will be spent.,111,,
882,0.97,7688.013,7695.788,"The report is requested to be presented in the committee by June 1ST or before the transmittal of the Medicare supplemental budget legislation, whatever occurs first.",111,,
883,0.97,7695.788,7701.627,We did increase funding in the 2022 budget for programs.,111,,
884,0.97,7701.627,7728.587,I wanted to avoid a cliff associated with anticipated reduction in funding and avoiding--we might be looking at one that starts in midyear but it would be important and helpful to know what to expect in that area.,111,,
885,0.97,7728.587,7729.254,Thank you.,112,,
886,0.97,7729.254,7733.592,"We are prepared to respond in writing, of course, Natalie, I see you are off mute.",112,,
887,0.97,7733.592,7734.426,Are you ready to share?,112,,
888,0.97,7734.426,7761.386,"Both of the analyses were pulled for the Lgbtq youth landscape analysis, as well as the food, clip analysis and we are prepared to have a response on or below June 4TH for--for the youth analysis, we will be done with that before quarter one.",113,,
889,0.97,7761.386,7792.217,"We have done a national best practice analysis and we have talked to local providers and we have done a pretty in-depth Scan of our current Lgbtq contracts, so we will provide over port in writing but Integrally sneak Peek, we are seeing some real high needs in the areas of use, aging out of foster care, youth, behavioral health, not a surprise.",113,,
890,0.97,7792.217,7794.92,"Lgbtq youth behavioral health, as well as specific needs for transit youth.",113,,
891,0.97,7794.92,7812.671,We are pretty excited to provide the results of that analysis which we are betting internally and with a few key subject matter experts in the community before we presented to the Council.,113,,
892,0.97,7812.671,7816.475,Thank you so much.,114,,
893,0.97,7816.475,7834.793,I really appreciate the identification of additional funds to potentially support this well documented but also emerging greater need that we are seeing and the community.,114,,
894,0.97,7834.793,7846.271,"We are seeing questions or comments--while I am Scrolling, I am going back to slide 12, which we were not over with quickly.",114,,
895,0.97,7846.271,7849.007,Thank you so much.,114,,
896,0.97,7849.007,7865.924,I just want to note to the viewing public--this is a unique client centered approach that provides a treatment for violence charges.,114,,
897,0.97,7865.924,7871.296,It is one of only three programs like it in the country.,114,,
898,0.97,7871.296,7881.84,"I understand Rfp through Hsd will expand the number of providers who are associated with the program, which will then conserve more people.",114,,
899,0.97,7881.84,7911.069,I want to flag also that there is really strong community interests in ensuring this program is not focused on--that it also includes a component where same gender couples are eligible.,114,,
