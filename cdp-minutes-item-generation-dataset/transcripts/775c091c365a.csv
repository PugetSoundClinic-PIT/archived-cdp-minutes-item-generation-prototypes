33,0.97,146.746,154.888,Mostly because of the need to have the Council bill required 30 days after signature by the Mayor to go into effect.,13,,
34,0.97,154.888,160.326,This would avoid an overlap with the June 30th deadline that currently exists in the bill.,13,,

214,0.97,844.21,848.847,By our historic but clearly failed police accountability system.,72,,
215,0.97,848.847,854.053,The Council remains wedded to a system that serves no one's needs.,72,,
216,0.97,854.053,861.627,"When the Seattle human rights Commission tries to address these Failings, they're silenced by the city.",72,,
217,0.97,861.627,880.112,The same Councilmembers that seemingly find it accept Thabl the SPD can end the life of a member of our community and follow that with erasing their memory by allowing that person to remain unnamed for over four months now.,72,,

226,0.97,927.092,940.773,This implies that SPD doesn't understand the tools or is--given the lack of Hoppest commitment to the ordinance process.,73,,
227,0.97,940.773,948.681,Neither of the two Technologies should be approved by city coupe sill.,73,,
228,0.97,948.681,956.355,Councilmembers Sowmed--for any--after all the public's questions have been answered.,73,,

252,0.97,1073.806,1083.148,Only certain bother some Encampments where city council placed politics with community are Prioritized for help.,74,,
253,0.97,1083.148,1110.742,Perhaps this is a sobering wake up call for Council's investment in the homeless crisis and the policy that SEES most money for homeless used unnecessarily suffering.,74,,

265,0.97,1189.388,1200.999,"However, we are still very concerned that the Sir does not specify the model names and numbers of the Audio recording devices.",75,,
266,0.97,1200.999,1205.137,That limits the ability of the public to review this technology.,75,,
267,0.97,1205.137,1219.418,"Without public disclosure of the manufacturer, auto names and numbers, it's impossible for there to be meaningful review.",75,,
268,0.97,1219.418,1228.26,Spd should also be required to disclose for how many incidents per year they use Audio recording systems.,75,,
269,0.97,1228.26,1237.736,We're concerned that the city's contract with IBM has not been publicly disclosed.,75,,
270,0.97,1237.736,1246.778,Likely to generate data errors that come bound existing biases.,75,,
271,0.97,1246.778,1258.724,There are no limits top kinds of data.,75,,
272,0.97,1258.724,1267.332,We ask that you require that SPD or the city make the contract with IBM publicly available.,75,,
273,0.97,1267.332,1272.671,That SPD limits the day that that may be Inputted.,75,,
