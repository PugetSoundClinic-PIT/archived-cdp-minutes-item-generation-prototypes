149,0.97,996.261,1000.299,Taking the word of the police is the exact reason we are at this point in the first place.,17,,

151,0.97,1016.115,1029.094,"If peaceful protesters are Outnumbering the so-called agitators more than 300 to 1, Andthe police cannot handle that with the $357 million budget and all of the training they received, then we clearly need a different organization to be in charge of our public safety if they're going to take it out on innocent people of Seattle instead of protecting them.",17,,
152,0.97,1029.094,1046.011,"State patrols being hurt, don't kill them, hit them hard, before the order is given does not sound like De-Escalation nor does it coincide with public safety.",17,,
153,0.97,1046.011,1046.678,It sounds like Premeditation.,17,,
154,0.97,1046.678,1052.518,"If officers need a Two-Piece inch of tape to make them feel better, maybe we should spend more on getting them therapy and less on special operations and Teargas.",17,,

162,0.97,1093.592,1094.993,Even before the rally began around 2:45 P.M.,19,,
163,0.97,1094.993,1098.597,I heard them exploding incendiaries.,19,,
164,0.97,1098.597,1101.133,My path was blocked by a line of police officers using bicycles.,19,,
165,0.97,1101.133,1102.701,Washington State patrol was already in full riot gear.,19,,
166,0.97,1102.701,1106.405,I've been to many rallies and I've never seen that kind of response before the rally started.,19,,
167,0.97,1106.405,1112.211,Mayor Durkan has not spoke publicly her press conferences this week.,19,,
168,0.97,1112.211,1112.878,I heard numerous explosions.,19,,
169,0.97,1112.878,1117.316,I saw people trying to pepper spray out of their eyes.,19,,
170,0.97,1117.316,1118.584,"Most were women, most were black.",19,,
171,0.97,1118.584,1122.187,Since then we have witnessed an escalation in police attacks.,19,,
172,0.97,1122.187,1127.426,They is the slightest provocation by one individual to attack the entire crowd.,19,,
173,0.97,1127.426,1131.93,"It is not democracy, it is not justice.",19,,
174,0.97,1131.93,1135.033,"Many of you know that I used to work in the Mayor's office, 10 years ago.",19,,
175,0.97,1135.033,1137.903,All of these issues came up again regarding menstruation management and more.,19,,
176,0.97,1137.903,1145.744,Independently reviews were done and change wasn't demented.,19,,
177,0.97,1145.744,1146.912,"Azucena said, nothing is changed.",19,,
178,0.97,1146.912,1155.053,"We spent a decade on just the most recent phase of police reform, it does not work.",19,,
179,0.97,1155.053,1162.227,We need to listen to the community members who are urging us to Defund the police and find a totally new way to find safe and healthy communities and Jenny Durkan needs to resign.,19,,
180,0.97,1162.227,1163.462,Solidarity to everyone at the protest.,19,,

183,0.97,1166.532,1170.435,Next Speaker.,20,,
184,0.97,1170.435,1178.844,"Hi, I am speaking regarding the violence displayed by SPD this weekend.",21,,
185,0.97,1178.844,1192.024,"After increased police activity in my neighborhood, I spent last night Taping plastic wrap and garbage bags to my windows and vent so I could hide in my shower out of fear that my neighborhood would be gassed by police.",21,,
186,0.97,1192.024,1195.494,I'm going to briefly list instances eyewitness Online that I saw as violence against our city and people.,21,,
187,0.97,1195.494,1207.739,Saturday police had unsecured assault rifles in their vehicle and promoting that they arrived for violence and not his De- escalate.,21,,
188,0.97,1207.739,1215.614,Monday they grabbed a pink umbrella from a Protester and proceeded to pepper spray them when they resisted.,21,,
189,0.97,1215.614,1221.086,"After six hours of peaceful protesting, a water bottle.",21,,
190,0.97,1221.086,1235.2,Health officials have stated many times the Covid is a respiratory disease that SPD is authorizing use of weapons that can cause long-term respiratory damage.,21,,
191,0.97,1235.2,1246.445,"Why does our city have funding for weapons when there are so many people who live here who are facing poverty, joblessness, lack of access to resources, and inability to pay their rent and basic utilities.",21,,
192,0.97,1246.445,1249.114,I agree with the previous speakers that we need to Defund the SPD.,21,,
193,0.97,1249.114,1252.851,"The funds should go to people who have been suffering and scared for decades I need help, now.",21,,
194,0.97,1252.851,1256.421,"All of these instances are on film, they been seen by people across the world on the Internet.",21,,
195,0.97,1256.421,1258.056,"It reflects not on us, but on you.",21,,
196,0.97,1258.056,1261.927,These are close civilians umbrellas.,21,,
197,0.97,1261.927,1272.237,"Who are trying to protect themselves, and De-Escalate one another amidst being met with armed law enforcement equipped with Chemical weapons, blunt objects, and guns.",21,,
198,0.97,1272.237,1282.08,"You are leaders, need to do battle, better to De-Escalate the violence in our city.",21,,
199,0.97,1282.08,1285.35,"Thank you for letting me speak today, have a nice day.",21,,
200,0.97,1285.35,1292.491,The next Speaker.,22,,
201,0.97,1292.491,1301.366,"Hi, this is Karen.",23,,
202,0.97,1301.366,1304.77,The city entered its consent decree due to blatant evidence of the overwhelmingly excessive use of force.,23,,
203,0.97,1304.77,1308.04,The past two days have shown all of us that nothing has changed.,23,,
204,0.97,1308.04,1310.776,The accountability system measures put in place have clearly not changed SPD's behavior.,23,,
205,0.97,1310.776,1328.927,"The city cannot fail its people by the over meaningful, rescind the city's request to under the consent decree.",23,,
206,0.97,1328.927,1331.396,"In fact, ask the judge to look into the management practices and policies.",23,,
207,0.97,1331.396,1334.099,"Also, it is your job to aggressively negotiate the police Union contracts.",23,,
208,0.97,1334.099,1335.4,Please do not let us down again.,23,,
209,0.97,1335.4,1339.738,The Mayor failed to protect the reform the people demanded and fought for.,23,,
210,0.97,1339.738,1342.607,"The reforms that were enacted into law, in her negotiations Úwith the police Union.",23,,
211,0.97,1342.607,1346.011,How the most recent contracts were overwhelmingly approved by city council is beyond me.,23,,
212,0.97,1346.011,1347.012,Cops investigate and cops.,23,,
213,0.97,1347.012,1352.451,Only six months to complete an investigation of a complaint against an officer.,23,,
214,0.97,1352.451,1359.024,Zero meaningful oversight of cops.,23,,
215,0.97,1359.024,1361.026,These are all things that you already addressed in law.,23,,
216,0.97,1361.026,1369.868,So SPD does not need to obey the law because it was not negotiation but protesters following the line exercise their first amendment constitutional rights get gassed and arrested.,23,,
217,0.97,1369.868,1381.146,"Anything short of a formal rejection of the Mayor's brutal tactics, lies, gas lighting of her own constituents is tacit approval.",23,,
218,0.97,1381.146,1385.45,"You want to know what the problem is, start at the top, with Jenny Durkan.",23,,
219,0.97,1385.45,1390.589,I also want to echo all of the other public Commenters today drop all charges against protesters.,23,,
220,0.97,1390.589,1393.692,"Stop using weapons against her own people, black lives matter.",23,,
221,0.97,1393.692,1398.597,Thank you.,23,,
222,0.97,1398.597,1400.398,Thank you.,24,,
223,0.97,1400.398,1402.601,The next Speaker.,24,,
224,0.97,1402.601,1409.708,"Hello, I am addressing policy accountability, and police accountability.",25,,
225,0.97,1409.708,1423.388,"I'm a masters of social work, over the last several months we have seen the political system to many impossible things in order to manage the Coronavirus pandemic.",25,,
226,0.97,1423.388,1426.625,For instance we waived Hipaa requirements for Telehealth.,25,,
227,0.97,1426.625,1440.472,We have been able to pass a lot of measures for financial aid stimulus and increase services very very quickly.,25,,
228,0.97,1441.173,1445.343,"Now, police violence and brutality is not new, and it is not a pandemic but it is obviously an epidemic.",25,,
229,0.97,1445.343,1450.148,"I feel confident that we are fully capable of making similar rapid massive changes for this, that we were able to make for Covid.",25,,
230,0.97,1450.148,1452.551,Why are police equipped with tear gas and flash bangs for instance.,25,,
231,0.97,1452.551,1453.885,"We could change that tomorrow, today.",25,,
232,0.97,1453.885,1459.958,"Let's be clear, water bottles being thrown in the park, that is an average nightly experience.",25,,
233,0.97,1459.958,1463.228,I had a friend a few months ago who had a glass bottle thrown at her.,25,,
234,0.97,1463.228,1468.166,I don't think the criminal justice system would have approved of her responding by tear gassing for city blocks.,25,,
235,0.97,1468.166,1470.669,I don't think anyone would have considered that a reasonable reaction.,25,,
236,0.97,1470.669,1479.678,Why is it a reasonable policy for the people.,25,,
237,0.97,1479.678,1495.56,"I bring up Covid, because if we made those rapid changes for pandemic mitigation, doing things like creating being stronger force policies, reducing the Militarization of the police, and Defunding our police is something we need to do for Covid and pandemic protection as well.",25,,
238,0.97,1495.56,1498.964,Protesters are not going to stop until there is reasonable to believe meaningful change will happen.,25,,
239,0.97,1498.964,1512.644,There is no evidence that a will be made safer to the citizens they are supposed to protect.,25,,
240,0.97,1512.644,1514.246,The more risk there is to get covered.,25,,
241,0.97,1514.246,1514.746,It increases nightly.,25,,
242,0.97,1514.746,1516.281,There are two health crisis at play.,25,,
243,0.97,1516.281,1518.75,Coronavirus and the systemic wonders of black people in Criminalization of blackness.,25,,
244,0.97,1518.75,1521.786,Which also is part of why folks are more worried about that than Coronavirus themselves.,25,,
245,0.97,1521.786,1524.789,In order to reduce one health crisis we must reduce the other end very quickly.,25,,
246,0.97,1524.789,1525.724,Thanks Jack.,25,,
247,0.97,1525.724,1530.629,Thank you.,26,,
248,0.97,1530.629,1531.83,Next Speaker.,26,,
249,0.97,1531.83,1539.404,"Hello, my name is Sydney Porter.",27,,
250,0.97,1539.404,1545.043,I'm a white student at the University of Washington who is tired of seeing my black and Brown peers having to fight against centuries-old oppression.,27,,
251,0.97,1545.043,1560.258,The ongoing protesting is in response to the virus violence they distortion my face at the Seattle police.,27,,
252,0.97,1560.258,1570.869,"An investigation led by the civil-rights mission of the Department of justice in 2011, found that one in five used excessive force, and that in most cases over 50% of these involved minorities.",27,,
253,0.97,1570.869,1583.682,The investigation concluded that the Seattle police Department offices escalate situations and used unnecessary or excessive force for minor offenses for the protesters argument demanding institutional change.,27,,
254,0.97,1583.682,1588.553,So brutality against black and Brown bodies cannot continue.,27,,
255,0.97,1588.553,1597.095,I will be speaking on the demands by the protesters.,27,,
256,0.97,1597.095,1606.271,"They include the Defunding of the SPD, and increase immediate and long-term investment in black communities.",27,,
257,0.97,1606.271,1616.781,"The Seattle police Department's priority is claimed to be reduce crime and disorder, to serve with honor, professionalism and to strive for excellence in service, to sponsor better trust, and to use Data-Driven policies and practices.",27,,
258,0.97,1616.781,1620.952,"As we have seen in recent protest, the Department does not hold themselves to their own set of improvement guidelines.",27,,
259,0.97,1620.952,1642.407,"As the Department of justice investigation, and the violence of the Seattle protest is revealed, the officers resorted to quickly to weapons, and have a track record of racially Biased practices.",27,,
260,0.97,1642.407,1649.347,"Instead of continuing to pour money into the hands of the SPD, we need to be investing in community programs.",27,,
261,0.97,1649.347,1652.984,50% cut from the SPD could be used to fund the community led program and education.,27,,
262,0.97,1652.984,1657.956,"Invest in people, not police.",27,,
263,0.97,1657.956,1660.859,Next Speaker.,28,,
264,0.97,1660.859,1670.435,"Hi, I am a member, I am a Seattle public school substitute.",29,,
265,0.97,1670.435,1686.084,"I wanted to address Mike comments, and increase, I wanted to let the city council know that I demand an increase of police accountability, crackdown on racial bias, and diminish the support.",29,,
266,0.97,1686.084,1699.097,"During the protest I see, and, I read a lot of, in a lot of places that police are turning off their body cameras, I demand that the use of force should be unaffected.",29,,
267,0.97,1699.097,1710.308,Officer badges numbers and names should be visible.,29,,
268,0.97,1712.277,1727.325,"In light of the current events of the Minneapolis public schools ending the relations with the Minneapolis police Department, I demand that also, Seattle public schools and the piano, Seattle PD reevaluate their relationship and try to terminate and move toward terminating their relationship with the Seattle police Department.",29,,
269,0.97,1727.325,1738.636,"I cannot, as a member of the educator community, I cannot look my students in the eye, and say I can protect you.",29,,
270,0.97,1738.636,1749.414,"I wake up every day, going to work worried about my fellow black students, teachers, and coworkers.",29,,
271,0.97,1749.414,1770.635,"So, with that, I demand also that the Seattle police Department being Defunded, and, the relationship that it has with the oldest member of the Seattle communities, especially with the public schools, being terminated.",29,,
272,0.97,1770.635,1771.369,Thank you.,29,,
273,0.97,1771.369,1772.27,Thank you.,30,,
274,0.97,1772.27,1774.639,Next Speaker.,30,,
275,0.97,1774.639,1779.944,Hello.,31,,
276,0.97,1779.944,1814.078,"The other nights, two nights ago, there was a protest and once the flash bangs and, tear gas went off, is seeped into my apartments, and my three month old son, who was sleeping, was Awoken from his sleep, coughing, crying, spitting out mucus, mucus bubbling out of his nose, he was bright red, and we were forced to leave our homes.",31,,
277,0.97,1814.078,1818.716,"We ran to our car, we did not even have time to put them in the car seat, because it was so bad.",31,,
278,0.97,1818.716,1822.887,"My wife had to put Breastmilk on his eyes, and we had to leave our home, and we are not there.",31,,
279,0.97,1822.887,1828.493,"We do not know when we can go back, because of the problems of tear gas seeping into our materials and affecting the respiratory health of infants.",31,,
280,0.97,1828.493,1845.777,"So I really want people to understand that, when police used tear gas, and the use of flash grenades, there is damage to protesters, which is wrong, but there is also damage to people who are not participating in the protest and live in those neighborhoods.",31,,
281,0.97,1845.777,1849.948,"Why would they use tear gas, which is a war crime, actually, why would they use that in a residential neighborhood.",31,,
282,0.97,1849.948,1855.653,"It emptied our building, and now I've had to figure out if I can even go there, because I am worried about my child lungs.",31,,
283,0.97,1855.653,1860.925,"I demand that the Seattle police immediately stop using tear gas and flash grenades, to handle protests.",31,,
284,0.97,1860.925,1875.54,"Do so in a more mature manner, and I demand accountability, because I want to speak for my son who is not old enough to speak yet.",31,,
285,0.97,1875.54,1883.681,"I hope that, although there is a lot of different stories and ideas, I hope this story stays with you, because it is a Three- month-old who cannot speak for himself and is very vulnerable and is being affected by this.",31,,
286,0.97,1883.681,1884.148,Thank you.,31,,
287,0.97,1884.148,1885.683,We have reached the 20 minute mark.,32,,
288,0.97,1885.683,1893.458,"Immunity members, if there is no objection the public comment period will be extended an additional 10 minutes.",32,,
289,0.97,1893.458,1900.498,"Seeing no objection, the public comment period, is extension 10 minutes.",32,,

296,0.97,1954.619,1958.456,"Okay, can you hear me better now?",35,,
297,0.97,1958.456,1963.261,We restarted your clock.,36,,
298,0.97,1963.261,1966.197,"I live in district 7, and is speaking on the protest this weekend.",37,,
299,0.97,1966.197,1990.955,"My initial location, was where I could not see the Plaza area, despite everything, they focused on a six-year-old white woman and nurse, and they handed out masks, and water, first aid items, not a hostile crowd.",37,,
300,0.97,1990.955,2000.498,"Our group continued South, around four.",37,,
301,0.97,2007.505,2029.527,"The crowd went noticeably tense, and if you minutes later, there was please officers in riot gear, the additional officers swarmed the building, in front of the building, the crowd became noticeably more anxious and hostile, especially people of color.",37,,
302,0.97,2029.527,2030.561,Civilians display the middle finger.,37,,
303,0.97,2030.561,2038.87,"I decided to record the crowd, because my instinct was I wanted to show how peaceful the crowd was in the moment before the Teargas was displayed.",37,,
304,0.97,2038.87,2041.339,I have never felt like that in my life.,37,,
305,0.97,2041.339,2053.684,"My overall impression, SPD greatly Ratcheted up what was basically a calm crowd peacefully exercising its rights.",37,,
306,0.97,2060.191,2060.858,And flashing vehicle lights.,37,,
307,0.97,2060.858,2066.464,Certainly the choice to to play Teargas into a crowd that was not writing concerns this impression.,37,,
308,0.97,2066.464,2074.639,"What I saw, SPD actually created whatever right occurred by initiating harmful actions.",37,,
309,0.97,2074.639,2086.651,"I would also like to state I would have really loved to see Mayor Durkan, and any of the Seattle city council sustained appearance, it might've helped.",37,,
310,0.97,2086.651,2096.994,"We have a President who is intent on Militarizing our law enforcement personnel, we should not be following that example, thank for your service and your interest.",37,,

312,0.97,2102.6,2111.008,"Hello, I live in district 4, and I am addressing the SPD's response to the protest.",39,,
313,0.97,2111.008,2123.721,I attended the protest was part of the peaceful protest witnessed countless active police aggression and escalation.,39,,
314,0.97,2123.721,2130.628,"My girlfriend experience it, which you try to return home from a peaceful protest on Sunday, and was accosted by an officer blocking her way.",39,,
315,0.97,2130.628,2136.4,There is no doubt in my mind that the violence that has taken place over the last three days was largely due to SPD's use of excessive force.,39,,
316,0.97,2136.4,2142.039,I would ask who the forces meant to protect and serve.,39,,
317,0.97,2142.039,2143.574,The issues the SPD run deeper than that.,39,,
318,0.97,2143.574,2145.343,"The force of the culture issue, that runs deep.",39,,

492,0.97,3226.623,3236.633,"It was equivalent to saying, if anybody is working right now, you are subject to go to jail.",51,,
493,0.97,3236.633,3240.804,"It was just a set up, and now that is pretty much 100% of everybody was walking at that time.",51,,
494,0.97,3240.804,3242.639,Everyone was pretty much set up to go to jail.,51,,
495,0.97,3242.639,3245.041,"The system right now, is a very, is very antagonistic role.",51,,
496,0.97,3245.041,3251.147,"It is not connecting with those who have elected folks to be in this position, to serve us.",51,,

527,0.97,3436.533,3438.001,It was just a wrecking crew.,53,,
528,0.97,3438.001,3439.035,There was no police presence.,53,,
529,0.97,3439.035,3439.836,I take that back.,53,,

531,0.97,3443.506,3445.542,They would see them and they would keep going.,53,,
532,0.97,3445.542,3456.119,I'm only bringing this up because I want to be able to preface it to what is going on with the peaceful protest.,53,,

534,0.97,3456.653,3463.893,"I can understand why the small business Association and people downtown have lost faith and trust in the city, because they trusted them, Hey, our business it should be Okay, and they got through.",53,,

543,0.97,3499.696,3501.764,That protest did stay peaceful.,53,,
544,0.97,3501.764,3506.503,"Of course the fire over there, there was some disorder.",53,,

547,0.97,3512.609,3522.151,"I do know when I arrived, they had locked off parts of the road in a few different ways but somehow they give up the position.",53,,
548,0.97,3522.151,3522.919,I cannot speak to that.,53,,
549,0.97,3522.919,3528.591,"When I went over there, there was no police presence, and it was a bit of chaos ensuing.",53,,
550,0.97,3528.591,3538.201,"The thing though, that did strike me, was that, and it was crazy, since they got it on Video.",53,,

557,0.97,3568.565,3572.635,"You will see on camera, I'm like Hey guys, this is getting looted right here, they're going into the Nordstrom's.",53,,
558,0.97,3572.635,3575.939,"Are you going to do anything, what is going on, then from there there was no movement.",53,,

562,0.97,3583.88,3586.683,I'm not an expert on police tactics on stuff like that.,53,,
563,0.97,3586.683,3593.99,"I do have an opinion about their tactics, as other tactics have impacted myself.",53,,
564,0.97,3593.99,3600.897,"But two days in a row, we saw the bad guys run free, two days in a row.",53,,
565,0.97,3600.897,3605.168,"You know what I am saying, there was tear grass deployed and everything on Saturday but two days in a row.",53,,
566,0.97,3605.168,3611.074,"Now let's go to Sunday, Sunday, peaceful protest, you know what I am saying, nobody really trust each other Saturday.",53,,
567,0.97,3611.074,3613.343,"Police are kind of like, we do not trust the protesters.",53,,
568,0.97,3613.343,3616.479,Protesters do not trust the police.,53,,
569,0.97,3616.479,3620.984,Peaceful protest 100%.,53,,
570,0.97,3620.984,3628.124,"Actually, Madison protest stops right there.",53,,

583,0.97,3675.672,3677.473,Where were these people supposed to go.,53,,
584,0.97,3677.473,3681.177,"A good thing, you watch you, you watch us.",53,,
585,0.97,3681.177,3687.25,"Instead the police wanted to sweep these people, these are peaceful people all day, seven hours.",53,,
586,0.97,3687.25,3689.886,"One of the most peaceful, whatever, seven hours.",53,,
587,0.97,3689.886,3693.289,The police invited them downtown.,53,,
588,0.97,3693.289,3702.098,"And what happened is, and I got the officer on tape, who was like, you guys should not have snuck down here.",53,,
589,0.97,3702.098,3705.334,"He is on tape, I'm like Hey guys, how do you want them to leave.",53,,
590,0.97,3705.334,3708.571,Not even as a journalist but as a concerned member of our society here in Seattle.,53,,
591,0.97,3708.571,3714.877,"They don't have a bus, there is no light rail.",53,,
592,0.97,3714.877,3715.711,Not my problem.,54,,
593,0.97,3715.711,3717.747,Somehow should've thought about that before they give the order.,54,,
594,0.97,3717.747,3719.115,I said we'll do not sweep them.,54,,
595,0.97,3719.115,3722.985,Just let them sit in the park.,54,,
596,0.97,3722.985,3724.187,They're going to tear themselves out.,54,,
597,0.97,3724.187,3726.823,"They were determined to save the protesters, peaceful protesters.",54,,
598,0.97,3726.823,3731.127,"Out of Seattle on Sunday night and man, I'm talking about a quick step.",54,,
599,0.97,3731.127,3742.038,"They took the Batons out there and they pushed us, they pushed us out, of pine Hill, and out the barn, people in Seattle, know that that is a steep hill.",54,,
600,0.97,3742.038,3744.74,Do not Chase people all the way to Broadway.,54,,
601,0.97,3744.74,3745.942,On a Sunday.,54,,
602,0.97,3745.942,3747.343,"Monday, you guys saw the tape.",54,,
603,0.97,3747.343,3748.411,You know what I am saying?,54,,
604,0.97,3748.411,3753.85,"This is the thing, I brought up.",54,,
605,0.97,3753.85,3770.733,"The police did make an improvement in tactic, is they never, these guys never tell anybody, what their comfort level is with the barricade.",54,,
606,0.97,3773.035,3775.571,"The strategies, the balance might be okay it is our protocol to be FIP.",54,,
607,0.97,3775.571,3776.839,Someone else might be three feet.,54,,
608,0.97,3776.839,3780.042,"But the general public, who just shows up, people assume a barricade, is where you go.",54,,
609,0.97,3780.042,3785.148,Seattle is the home of great music or look how many concerts people automatically go to the front of the concert at the barricade.,54,,
610,0.97,3785.148,3785.982,It is a natural intuition.,54,,
611,0.97,3785.982,3793.489,The barricade was always usable because police get nervous.,54,,
612,0.97,3793.489,3797.426,"The thing is, what I was saying, as if they are nervous at the barricade, make a deeper barricade.",54,,
613,0.97,3797.426,3804.066,"It is easier for the police to step back to make the room to comfort themselves than it is to tell a Protester with 1000 people, to step back.",54,,
614,0.97,3804.066,3806.469,Police can make a 10 foot barricade if they wanted.,54,,
615,0.97,3806.469,3811.774,That was not the case on Monday.,54,,
616,0.97,3811.774,3815.411,"And, you saw the tape for yourself, you know what I am saying.",54,,
617,0.97,3815.411,3822.919,"Beyond that, the reality, for a second and is trying to talk fast.",54,,
618,0.97,3822.919,3826.222,You know we put the tape out there.,54,,
619,0.97,3826.222,3834.13,"Last night, and last night, man, I sense my gas mask home.",54,,
620,0.97,3834.13,3842.705,"I was like this is going to end peacefully, all the way to Broadway, until somebody threw a water bottle.",54,,
621,0.97,3842.705,3845.241,"And my friend, the footage is out there.",54,,
622,0.97,3845.241,3855.251,"The question beyond that, are these responses too much.",54,,
623,0.97,3855.251,3861.924,"Especially when I brought it Friday, when people ran through the city and Saturday when all these people Vandalizing the city, with insights.",54,,
624,0.97,3861.924,3863.359,You know what I am saying?,54,,
625,0.97,3863.359,3876.639,"Is what we are experiencing here, personal, and also, I would have to say here, the state police, people who have been following my feed for three or four days commencing man, the state police is real aggressive.",54,,
626,0.97,3876.639,3878.641,We learned about the state police on Saturday.,54,,
627,0.97,3878.641,3883.88,We learned about them on Saturday and I keep saying it.,54,,
628,0.97,3883.88,3885.381,"Man, these guys are very aggressive.",54,,
629,0.97,3885.381,3892.588,"Now you see there is nothing there in the Seattle times, about the state police.",54,,
630,0.97,3892.588,3897.66,"I will say this, and I want to say this, with the police, there have been some great instances of humanity with the Seattle police.",54,,
631,0.97,3897.66,3902.398,"A lot of them, I've had to have them stop and give me waters I can keep up.",54,,
632,0.97,3902.398,3907.403,But there is and some excellent communicators within the SPD.,54,,
633,0.97,3907.403,3909.939,"A lot of times you know, they are not out there.",54,,
634,0.97,3909.939,3914.31,Sometimes.,54,,
635,0.97,3914.31,3920.616,"But you know there been instances where, the guys are on the job, they will come and communicate in the best way, and their communication in turn Defuses the situation.",54,,
636,0.97,3920.616,3929.925,"There is not a consistent level of De-Escalation here, and I do not think there is a consistent level of comparing events law.",54,,
637,0.97,3929.925,3932.194,How can Saturday be a riot and Monday be a riot.,54,,
638,0.97,3932.194,3934.43,"You know what I'm saying, there is two different things.",54,,
639,0.97,3934.43,3939.402,"I don't have a Timer., I don't know where I met with my tongue, I wanted to move quickly.",54,,
640,0.97,3939.402,3944.607,I cannot hear you.,54,,
641,0.97,3944.607,3946.409,I appreciate that.,55,,
642,0.97,3946.409,3956.686,"I think given that we have more speakers and I want to leave some time for the Council members asked questions, if we can move on that would be great.",55,,
643,0.97,3956.686,3960.189,I appreciate your firsthand account and all of the reporting you're doing out there.,55,,
644,0.97,3960.189,3963.492,Next Speaker.,55,,

646,0.97,3972.435,3976.072,I wanted to speak to the fact that this is not an isolated incident.,56,,
647,0.97,3976.072,3978.641,I have been too many protests over a number of years.,56,,
648,0.97,3978.641,4002.565,"I have seen regularly, that SPD comes to like black organizing, black protests with a certain amount of aggression, riot police, pepper spray, consistently, regardless of what kind of action it is, regardless of how peaceful it is that is what we are met with each time.",56,,
649,0.97,4002.565,4010.406,"On Saturday, I was, and no way surprised, that is the SPD I know.",56,,
650,0.97,4010.406,4018.614,"It is also concerning that we are getting a few different things from Carmen best, from governor Inslee, and from our Mayor.",56,,
651,0.97,4018.614,4041.103,"A Mayor who was actually, working on the investigation, in 2011 and 2012 that stated that our SPD has a serious, serious Issuewith excessive force, specifically toward black and Brown folks within the city.",56,,
652,0.97,4041.103,4053.849,"For her to come at the same time, be very keenly aware of what the SPD does, while also, you know, treating a situation in which we are, old and, it is deeply concerning.",56,,
653,0.97,4053.849,4059.655,"The fact that governor Inslee, release the National Guard on Saturday.",56,,
654,0.97,4059.655,4066.128,"But stated that, specifically, they would not be arms, when in fact, I sat with my own eyes, I have footage.",56,,
655,0.97,4066.128,4070.332,They were very much arms.,56,,
656,0.97,4070.332,4073.569,"They had guns, they had a tank in the middle of our city.",56,,
657,0.97,4073.569,4074.637,Those are just facts.,56,,
658,0.97,4074.637,4090.052,"And we have Carmen best who has been posting and like neighborhood groups and spewing these lies about the SPD, saying that number one, the incident that is happening in Minnesota is so different than what we have here.",56,,
659,0.97,4090.052,4106.302,"You know, talking about how the city, SPD itself has proved itself, that it D Escalades, that the SPD has a track record of not using excessive force, which is false.",56,,
660,0.97,4106.302,4123.919,"All of these things that we are seeing, it concerns me deeply that our leadership is actually, is lying to its people, and making people feel comfortable, and reality, we are in a serious, this is a police state.",56,,
661,0.97,4123.919,4127.823,We have so many issues going on in the city.,56,,
662,0.97,4127.823,4136.332,"I have friends that are social workers that are working with homeless people, during Covid, front lines, and are still struggling to pay their rent.",56,,
663,0.97,4136.332,4142.838,"We have SPD, that are, their yearly salary starts at over hundred thousand?",56,,
664,0.97,4142.838,4144.039,It does not make sense.,56,,
665,0.97,4144.039,4149.545,What has Seattle PD done to show that it is protecting its people.,56,,
666,0.97,4149.545,4152.214,In reality I live in Ranier Beach.,56,,
667,0.97,4152.214,4156.452,I see hundreds of cops a month.,56,,
668,0.97,4156.452,4159.054,"We are being over policed, specifically because of the color of our skin.",56,,
669,0.97,4159.054,4163.959,It is not shocking.,56,,
670,0.97,4163.959,4180.276,"It is really sad, that I am watching a lot of young folks, who have never been able to come to a protest before, who are excited about speaking their minds, and talking.",56,,
671,0.97,4180.276,4183.145,"You know, using their rights, these are the rights we talk about as Americans.",56,,
672,0.97,4183.145,4187.116,"You know the land of the third, free.",56,,
673,0.97,4187.116,4189.618,"Simply by showing up to speak their mind, they are being attacked.",56,,
674,0.97,4189.618,4192.988,They are being Teargas.,56,,
675,0.97,4192.988,4205.267,"We all are, and these, there is something so concerning that we are so comfortable with these curfews.",56,,
676,0.97,4205.267,4213.108,"You know, I was in the middle of a protest, I got the Curfew notification, and maybe 5:12 when I was in the middle of the city surrounded by riot police.",56,,
677,0.97,4213.108,4225.12,"No buses, no Rideshare services, NOTE light rail, no way to get out of the city, and the entire city has the Curfew.",56,,
678,0.97,4225.12,4227.556,"Cops can follow you anywhere in the city, not just downtown.",56,,
679,0.97,4227.556,4230.192,You can follow me all the way to my home and arrest me.,56,,
680,0.97,4230.192,4232.628,That is so alarming.,56,,
681,0.97,4232.628,4233.462,How is that not Fascist.,56,,
682,0.97,4233.462,4246.642,"How is it not, I think we have a chance now, to actively change the way that the city deals with its police.",56,,
683,0.97,4246.642,4248.844,"At first, it cannot be complicit.",56,,
684,0.97,4248.844,4255.551,In the violence of the police.,56,,
685,0.97,4255.551,4258.621,"This just, the SPD needs to be Defunded.",56,,
686,0.97,4258.621,4266.328,"That is my argument, immensely, thank you.",56,,
687,0.97,4266.328,4270.032,Thank you.,57,,
688,0.97,4270.032,4274.27,"Next Speaker, Dominique Davis.",57,,
689,0.97,4274.27,4275.638,Thank you.,58,,
690,0.97,4275.638,4285.981,I appreciate you giving us this time.,58,,
691,0.97,4285.981,4288.484,I will be very short because I know we are short on time.,58,,
692,0.97,4288.484,4293.555,"Everybody is pretty much covered everything, and that you guys, you guys get a good picture what is going on these last few days.",58,,
693,0.97,4293.555,4295.991,Have a Timeline for everything.,58,,
694,0.97,4295.991,4304.5,"One of the things I got a call on Friday about from some of my people that were on the grounds, hey man, we have just seen these vans pull up, with a bunch of white people dressed in black.",58,,
695,0.97,4304.5,4305.2,And what I mean.,58,,
696,0.97,4305.2,4308.604,"Those are anarchist or something, now I do not know what they are going to do.",58,,
697,0.97,4308.604,4317.78,"They just pulled up and for vans, they must've came from somewhere else or something you know.",58,,
698,0.97,4317.78,4321.617,"I said let me know what happens, and I started getting Video of people heading up and calling me.",58,,
699,0.97,4321.617,4323.218,"Hey man, they are tearing stuff up.",58,,
700,0.97,4323.218,4337.433,"That was weird to me, to get a call, bow some vans pulling up, with people dressed in black on Friday night, so, that just told me there is an organized effort.",58,,
701,0.97,4337.433,4339.101,"So, that is one point I want to make.",58,,
702,0.97,4339.101,4346.041,"Another point I wanted to make was the fact that, I think everybody has seen the footage of the young white kid that got his hands on the AR 15.",58,,
703,0.97,4346.041,4349.845,"He was getting ready to pose for a picture in the middle of everything, I think that was Saturday.",58,,
704,0.97,4349.845,4355.751,He was getting ready to pose for a picture in the middle of all of the stuff going on in the middle of the riot.,58,,
705,0.97,4355.751,4360.556,"A white undercover officer, or plainclothes officer runs often with his gun pulled out.",58,,
706,0.97,4360.556,4362.624,He was armed too.,58,,
707,0.97,4362.624,4368.731,With another AR 15 around her shoulder.,58,,
708,0.97,4368.731,4371.767,"He ran up on the kid, and grabbed the gun out of the kids hand.",58,,
709,0.97,4371.767,4373.168,Told the kid get out of here.,58,,
710,0.97,4373.168,4379.174,And dropped the clip out of the gun and all of that took care of the situation and diffused the situation.,58,,
711,0.97,4379.174,4383.378,"The first thing that ran through my head, is what if that kid was black.",58,,
712,0.97,4383.378,4390.452,What would have happened if that kid had an AR 15 was a black kid getting ready to pose for a picture with an AR 15.,58,,
713,0.97,4390.452,4397.793,"Would it have been the same situation, would have the police officer ran up on the kid and told him to get out of here, Scram, beat it.",58,,
714,0.97,4397.793,4401.597,"Is that what would happen, you know?",58,,
715,0.97,4401.597,4417.513,"I have to put it out there let you know that this is what we are dealing with, on our daily existence living in the United States of America and living in this city.",58,,
716,0.97,4417.513,4428.223,"I imagine if that was one of the kids that I work with, one of the young men I work with, and they are in the middle of all this Craziness and they get their hands on a gun, what is going to happen to them when an officer SEES them.",58,,
717,0.97,4428.223,4431.293,I don't like seeing young girls 15-16 years old being pepper sprayed in the face.,58,,
718,0.97,4431.293,4439.034,I don't like seeing young teenagers being pushed and shoved around by law enforcement.,58,,
719,0.97,4439.034,4440.102,Don't get me wrong.,58,,
720,0.97,4440.102,4443.906,"These are not just kids of color, these are kids of every color, from every hue, and every Ethnicity.",58,,
721,0.97,4443.906,4466.628,"I don't like seeing people treated unfairly, at the end of the day it breaks my heart to see kids that are out using their voice being activists standing up and speaking for their rights, of all people, and the people that see that and are being treated bad, then they get punished, pushed, beaten and pepper sprayed, because they feel like they have a right to stand up for the rights of other people.",58,,
722,0.97,4466.628,4480.843,"We should be applauding them, we should be lifting them up, we should be giving them awards, for being brave enough to go out and stand up for people that they are seeing being treated wrong.",58,,
723,0.97,4480.843,4483.078,"They should not be shoved, pushed, pepper sprayed, it should not happen.",58,,
724,0.97,4483.078,4484.646,That is all you got to say.,58,,
725,0.97,4484.646,4492.588,"At the end of the day, I've got to put this out to say, I know a lot of really good police officers that should be taking the lead on all of this.",58,,
726,0.97,4492.588,4495.29,We should be Militarize our police force.,58,,
727,0.97,4495.29,4498.293,They should not look like they're going to war in Afghanistan and Iraq.,58,,
728,0.97,4498.293,4505.601,"They should walk out in the regular uniforms and being concerned with people, and having issues.",58,,
729,0.97,4505.601,4508.704,Having conversations about the trauma that is being put on the communities.,58,,
730,0.97,4508.704,4513.308,Not of all colors from overseeing and witnessing.,58,,
731,0.97,4513.308,4515.777,But we have got officers that are willing to do that.,58,,
732,0.97,4515.777,4518.113,And we have officers that do that.,58,,
733,0.97,4518.113,4522.851,They should be leading this charge and we should not have people up there Militarize with tanks and weapons and all of that.,58,,
734,0.97,4522.851,4526.121,That is all I have got to say.,58,,
735,0.97,4526.121,4529.591,I cannot hear you.,58,,
736,0.97,4529.591,4535.497,Thank you.,59,,
737,0.97,4535.497,4545.607,"Our last Panelist, and I want to recognize that we have been joined by Councilmember Dan Stross.",59,,
738,0.97,4545.607,4547.843,"All, can I talk now.",60,,
739,0.97,4547.843,4554.349,"Please do, thank you.",61,,
740,0.97,4554.349,4587.883,"I represent global lands, aunts, I was out there, and, I just wanted to say that with the consent decree, it is very shocking that you know after work, I am driving, and I just see folks, walking up to the barricade, and then, the next thing I know, the police are pepper spring and gassing folks without any sort of warning, that they are not supposed to be using excessive force.",62,,
741,0.97,4587.883,4593.388,"These are peaceful folks, with their hands up, and this is what Jenny Durkan allows.",62,,
742,0.97,4593.388,4610.605,"It was shocking for her to say that, these folks are perpetuating violence and blamed it on white men, but it just reminds me of how white women blame their husbands and she is also complicit in what these police officers are doing.",62,,
743,0.97,4610.605,4620.782,"Police are beating people to the ground, and in my experience, this is been really excessive.",62,,
744,0.97,4620.782,4629.324,"I've been to many protest, and led many things for to see you all are gassing children, they should be ashamed of themselves.",62,,
745,0.97,4629.324,4646.008,"In a city where you all have canceled a lot of community programs that help children in need, the city of Seattle has, you know the budget for the police departments, over $300,000, yet, you cannot even find some of the people who work for the city to have proper housing.",62,,
746,0.97,4646.008,4647.509,They are living paycheck to paycheck.,62,,
747,0.97,4647.509,4649.244,"Again, Jenny Durkan should be ashamed of herself.",62,,
748,0.97,4649.244,4654.816,The people who work for the city of Seattle cannot even afford to live in the city of Seattle.,62,,
749,0.97,4654.816,4662.324,"It has been really intense, to see the way that you are treating youth.",62,,
750,0.97,4662.324,4674.636,"It was really intense to watch a child, a 15-year-old child pick up an AR gun, and AR 15 gun, and all I thought about was to marry her rights.",62,,
751,0.97,4674.636,4680.075,"She was, he was shot and killed for toy gun that he had.",62,,
752,0.97,4680.075,4681.343,He did not even give a chance.,62,,
753,0.97,4681.343,4686.381,"It shows that you are able to show self-restraint, but not self-restraint for black youth.",62,,
754,0.97,4686.381,4712.407,"The city is, unable to get all of the wealth that you will have, because what, we are black, we are Undocumented, Non- English speakers, incarcerated or formerly incarcerated, House list, it is a shame that Jenny Durkan is doing Sweeps in the middle of a pandemic and making the folks not meet their shelter needs for that is a fact.",62,,
755,0.97,4712.407,4713.208,That is a shame.,62,,
756,0.97,4713.208,4721.183,"You have all of this wealth, it is just shocking.",62,,
757,0.97,4721.183,4727.222,"I really think that we should Defund the police, spread that money to other things.",62,,
758,0.97,4727.222,4751.246,"It is shocking that other cities are able to house folks in hotels, there are so many apartment buildings, that are open, yet, here we are, just, sweeping and making them walk to their place, and not replacing their items.",62,,
759,0.97,4751.246,4752.681,It is just been really shocking.,62,,
760,0.97,4752.681,4756.451,"I'm also not surprised, because this is a police state.",62,,
761,0.97,4756.451,4780.876,"It is very shocking that you also had a protest, with the police departments, and the amount the folks were given a permit, and you had police not sitting there, and focusing on them, well people are getting flash bangs, people are getting hit with bicycles, yet, what are you doing over there.",62,,
762,0.97,4780.876,4788.95,"So, I just do not understand how folks are able to get permits, and all of these things, and all of these privileges, yet we are sitting here being beat with Batons, getting followed.",62,,
763,0.97,4788.95,4794.356,"Like Dominic said, like they said there was no transportation.",62,,
764,0.97,4794.356,4795.29,People were fearing for their life.,62,,
765,0.97,4795.29,4801.796,Got to provide mutual aid to get people out.,62,,
766,0.97,4801.796,4806.268,"City workers had to use their city badges, that is what I heard to make sure folks were able to get out safely.",62,,
767,0.97,4806.268,4807.269,That is a shame.,62,,
768,0.97,4807.269,4808.47,You are putting everyone at risk.,62,,
769,0.97,4808.47,4814.976,"All you care, all these folks, all Jenny Durkan seems to care about is herself and who is underneath her.",62,,
770,0.97,4814.976,4818.313,"She does not care about the people she employs, the Childcare folks that she employs.",62,,
771,0.97,4818.313,4822.517,"She laid them all off, so.",62,,
772,0.97,4822.517,4826.621,"Defund the police, black lives matter, and that is all I have got to say.",62,,
773,0.97,4826.621,4835.096,"Thank you Ivana, I appreciate you taking your time, all of you with us.",63,,
774,0.97,4835.096,4849.11,"I invite my colleagues on the Council, to put their names into the chat function, to let me know, whether or not you have questions for our panelists.",63,,
775,0.97,4849.11,4857.652,"In the alternate, you could, for those of you, I think you have my phone number, you could certainly text me, directly.",63,,
776,0.97,4857.652,4864.559,And I will get you into the Queue.,63,,
777,0.97,4864.559,4870.465,"I do not see anybody in the chat section, just yet.",63,,
778,0.97,4870.465,4874.135,"So, I think I'm going to start us off with a question, if that is okay.",63,,
779,0.97,4874.135,4890.952,"I would be really interested to know from each of you, given the fact that the Mayor has issued a Curfew, that is going to go every night between tonight and Friday nights, ending on Saturday morning.",63,,
780,0.97,4890.952,4903.598,"Given that initially this Curfew, there is been an expressed desire to balance the rights of demonstrators, expressing their first amendment rights, with the needs of the city.",63,,
781,0.97,4903.598,4924.719,"To maintain, peace, and safety, would really love your perspective from being down on the ground, and sometimes into these curfews, I watched a lot of your live feed last night.",63,,
782,0.97,4924.719,4936.831,"Would really like to get your perspective on the role, that continuing curfews have on the city meeting what it stated goals are.",63,,
783,0.97,4936.831,4951.046,"To be honest with you, the Curfew, it means nothing, in a sense, that it is like, so one, you have a lot of conflicting things.",64,,
784,0.97,4951.046,4955.35,"America yesterday was like Okay, you can protest, be peaceful, just do not tear anything up.",64,,
785,0.97,4955.35,4956.618,And it will be fine.,64,,
786,0.97,4956.618,4963.658,"Then you have the police or like man, because of this Curfew, you need to go home.",64,,
787,0.97,4963.658,4975.67,"If there is no Curfew, I don't know, very well, might feel like.",64,,
788,0.97,4975.67,4985.98,"They may sit there and protest, but, what I'm trying to say is that the law enforcement, a lot of times, seems like they use the Curfew to do what I guess the Curfew is supposed to do, clear the streets.",64,,
789,0.97,4985.98,4987.048,You know what I am saying.,64,,
790,0.97,4987.048,4991.486,"There is nobody who is standing, some of you has been out there and seeing everything.",64,,
791,0.97,4991.486,5002.297,"There is nobody really staying at home, all it does is hurt a lot of businesses, because there are a lot of restaurants closed, I saw them close down there, and, so, as far as the protest.",64,,
792,0.97,5002.297,5005.5,I don't really see the Curfew as being effective.,64,,
793,0.97,5005.5,5016.945,"I do see it as a tool, if they need to, gives the law enforcement an opportunity, to engage if they so need to, and they can say it is because of the Curfew.",64,,
794,0.97,5023.551,5024.085,Thank you.,65,,
795,0.97,5024.085,5028.523,Anybody else have any reflections on that question?,65,,

799,0.97,5046.641,5052.881,"Councilmember musk Eddie, yes please.",65,,
800,0.97,5052.881,5062.056,Thank you so much for your time to take the stories to my to have been watching a lot of the ladies.,66,,
801,0.97,5062.056,5064.159,I know many people are put their lives at risk.,66,,
802,0.97,5064.159,5099.027,"I just want to take a minute to say, how angry we all must be, to risk our lives not just because of Covid, but because of the police response, to turn out in the street, and I think it should go explicitly said, that, the actions that you all have been reporting on, and shared stories on today demand a response, you have put your lives at risk, people have put their lives at risk on a daily basis during a deadly pandemic to call attention to massive institutional violence, against community members.",66,,
803,0.97,5099.027,5108.77,Mostly I wanted to say thank you and put your stories in the context of the ongoing public health pandemic that is killing disproportionate numbers of black and Brown community members.,66,,
804,0.97,5108.77,5123.585,"Your testimony is very important, and I want to just say, thank you for sharing it and to underscore what I think Councilmember Herbold has been saying.",66,,
805,0.97,5123.585,5128.49,"No one should be gas lighting the stories, no one should be discrediting or dismissing those stories told by the folks on the frontline.",66,,
806,0.97,5128.49,5133.328,"We've heard that from the Mayor's office, and we continue to want to elevate those stories and those experiences.",66,,
807,0.97,5133.328,5142.403,"I appreciate that this panel went first today, and you all have really shown, Shined a light on the truth of what your expensing on the frontline.",66,,
808,0.97,5142.403,5145.473,What I have heard from you is a water bottle is not a weapon.,66,,
809,0.97,5145.473,5152.814,"A water bottle is not a weapon and should not have resulted in Teargas, flash bang, and rubber bullets last night.",66,,
810,0.97,5152.814,5173.668,"What I also heard, from earlier in the public testimony, was this is also not a unique situation, and I wondered if the second person who testified could speak a little bit more about the disproportionate types of horse that you see happen when black lives matter protests have occurred in the past.",66,,
811,0.97,5173.668,5187.715,"And, some of the situations you have also experienced when it comes to sort of the difference may be in the women's March versus other black lives matter marches that you participated in.",66,,
812,0.97,5187.715,5191.986,Are there other stories you would like to share about the disproportionate use of force you have seen in the past.,66,,
813,0.97,5191.986,5199.494,I think I was number two.,67,,
814,0.97,5199.494,5220.815,"I, what I would like to say is this, is that, so I have been covering, things that I've seen that is been consistent, covering Mayday, 2016, the police give up almost 5 miles from Westlake all the way down to soda.",67,,
815,0.97,5220.815,5227.322,"They push the people out there, all the way to Soto.",67,,
816,0.97,5227.322,5233.094,"Some people wanted to go to jail, whatever.",67,,
817,0.97,5233.094,5241.736,"But the police in a Well- Crafted strategy, and they want to protect property and the protesters, and really gave up plenty of movement downtown.",67,,
818,0.97,5241.736,5245.006,That is what I saw four years ago.,67,,
819,0.97,5245.006,5248.443,"They also pulled out the flash bangs, they did some other stuff then, there as well.",67,,
820,0.97,5248.443,5256.551,"There were some other Marches, where, that I have seen, the escalation level is much lower.",67,,
821,0.97,5256.551,5271.566,"I just have to be real, insincere, is that when you get people, that are protesting, against things around social distance and equity, and I'm not a big social justice guy.",67,,
822,0.97,5271.566,5274.469,"With people, the police take a different posture.",67,,
823,0.97,5274.469,5278.373,"People see my reporting, when you talk about posturing.",67,,
824,0.97,5278.373,5282.644,If they just have their short sleeve shirts on.,67,,
825,0.97,5282.644,5284.979,And those postures interact with each other.,67,,
826,0.97,5284.979,5289.283,They impact each other.,67,,
827,0.97,5289.283,5298.059,"What I am saying, man, I have never seen this amount of force.",67,,
828,0.97,5298.059,5306.2,"I would say this, last night, bottle thrown, rubber bullets.",67,,
829,0.97,5306.2,5313.207,"Let me tell you I got it on tape, the protesters returns, reconstituted their line.",67,,
830,0.97,5313.207,5328.089,"One of them was a nurse, hands up, do not shoot.",67,,
831,0.97,5328.089,5329.991,Three additional times from when the water bottle was thrown.,67,,
832,0.97,5329.991,5331.125,Let's put that over there.,67,,
833,0.97,5331.125,5334.829,"Three additional times, hands up, do not shoot.",67,,
834,0.97,5334.829,5335.43,They gassed them.,67,,
835,0.97,5335.43,5337.231,"Three additional times, that is what I am saying.",67,,
836,0.97,5337.231,5339.934,"I could not speak on the first incident, I did not see it.",67,,
837,0.97,5339.934,5344.138,"Three times, it is like, you know what I am saying.",67,,
838,0.97,5344.138,5347.008,"Three times excessive gas, being heard from the public testimony.",67,,
839,0.97,5347.008,5351.446,That is what I can show.,67,,
840,0.97,5351.446,5357.919,Is the Disproportionality of the use of force.,67,,
841,0.97,5357.919,5360.655,Thank you.,68,,
842,0.97,5360.655,5366.627,Councilmember Sawant please.,68,,
843,0.97,5366.627,5377.638,"Thank you Councilmember Herbold, and I really appreciate all of the panelists who spoke from their hearts and spoke facts about the truth of the situation.",69,,
844,0.97,5377.638,5393.888,"I am also incredibly grateful to the people who testified in public comments and I hope that those of you who were not able to testify, during the start of the meeting will come back at the end of the meeting, because absolutely, I want to hear from you, I'm pretty sure other Councilmembers want to hear from you.",69,,
845,0.97,5393.888,5405.266,"I also wanted to let all of the activists out there know, that, members for my political organization are going to be other than the protest right now, there out there right now.",69,,
846,0.97,5405.266,5419.714,"And I wanted to thank brother REYNOLD who had to leave, who just testified on this panel, just wanted to acknowledge that he was with me at the press conference this morning, when we had Spokespeople from the community, including the Naacp.",69,,
847,0.97,5419.714,5428.422,"Who had said, that we cannot allow the Mayor and the city establishment to lift the consent decree.",69,,
848,0.97,5428.422,5434.128,And I have some more points about that but I will save it for the next panel.,69,,
849,0.97,5434.128,5437.565,I just wanted to just acknowledge some of the points that are being made by community members.,69,,
850,0.97,5437.565,5453.448,"One is that we need to make the consent decree, although we do not believe that is going to be enough, we will need far more substantial beyond that.",69,,
851,0.97,5453.448,5462.356,"I will acknowledge that Amanda does come from the community to Defund the police budget, and to cut the police budget in half, I wanted to let everyone know just like I did in the press conference this morning.",69,,
852,0.97,5462.356,5467.228,"I absolutely support that demand, I will be bringing that amendment forward during the budget discussion, invite other Councilmembers to join me in that.",69,,
853,0.97,5467.228,5488.616,"I also think it is extremely crucial, that, we ban the city and the city's police from obtaining or using any type of chemical weapons including Teargas, and rubber bullets.",69,,
854,0.97,5489.417,5493.921,"I will be looking into whatever legislative means that are possible, to ban the use of chemical weapons and rubber bullets.",69,,
855,0.97,5493.921,5501.062,"I will keep the movement informed, and again, I am happy to work with any Councilmember who wants to, who shares that goal with me, and I'm sure it is shared by the community.",69,,
856,0.97,5501.062,5522.617,"And, I wanted to thank everyone for their courage and last but not least, thanks Jake for the independent media work that you and others have done, which is provided incredible Video evidence on how the police are the ones, often instigating and not just instigating but participating in the violence and they seem to come prepared to instigate violence.",69,,
857,0.97,5522.617,5523.384,Thank you.,69,,
858,0.97,5523.384,5529.023,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,70,,
859,0.97,5529.023,5532.593,What any other Councilmembers like to address the panel?,70,,
860,0.97,5532.593,5534.695,Councilmember Morales.,70,,
861,0.97,5534.695,5538.633,Thank you.,71,,
862,0.97,5538.633,5546.007,"Sorry I used the chat, but that is not always as effective as we planned.",71,,
863,0.97,5546.007,5561.322,"I want to echo everyone's thanks to you all for joining us, and to apologize for the way that this city has reacted to people, merely trying to exercise their first amendment rights.",71,,
864,0.97,5561.322,5575.069,"I was on a CPC call earlier this morning, and, heard more, from our community members who are obviously grieving and traumatized, and outraged.",71,,
865,0.97,5575.069,5595.389,"One of the things that we talked about, on that call, that we heard, actually several times over the last few days, is that, discussion about how we have robust accountability system, we have a robust system in place for dealing with complaints.",71,,
866,0.97,5595.389,5604.899,"We know we have had at least 12,000 of them that have been made, in the last few days.",71,,
867,0.97,5604.899,5611.405,"I think it misses the point, the bigger point, which is that, there should not be a need to review anything.",71,,
868,0.97,5611.405,5617.511,"People exercising their first amendment rights, should not be put at risk, for doing that.",71,,
869,0.97,5617.511,5623.818,They should not be at risk of an excessive use of force by publicly funded public servants.,71,,
870,0.97,5623.818,5631.225,"And so, I just want to be really clear, that we need to have the right framing and plans as we are having this discussion.",71,,
871,0.97,5631.225,5640.534,"I also do want to ask, DOM if you are still on, coach don.",71,,
872,0.97,5640.534,5646.741,"And, we have actually heard several times, about this issue, of vans of people showing up.",71,,
873,0.97,5646.741,5670.931,"I had a constituents, message me, that's, she has a clergy member, she went to bear witness, to what is happening, and, she saw a Van load of people show up, dressed in black Bulletproof vests, and, and so, just wondering if you have any more information about, where the vans came from.",71,,
874,0.97,5670.931,5673.367,Where did you see them.,71,,
875,0.97,5673.367,5680.274,"You know, how many people were there.",71,,
876,0.97,5680.274,5685.846,"This is something we have heard several times, and I think it is going to be an important part of, as we try to unfold what happened.",71,,
877,0.97,5685.846,5696.657,"Try to have a little more details about, what that was about.",71,,
878,0.97,5696.657,5712.807,"I personally was an eyewitness, to this event, but when I got the call, the information I got, as if they were up around the Broadway area, and that, I think it was three or four vans had pulled up, all at the same time, and they were all getting out, they were all dressed in black.",72,,
879,0.97,5712.807,5714.508,They had their masks on and everything.,72,,
880,0.97,5714.508,5719.88,"Some of my Homeboys that were there seeing this hit me up, these guys are tripping, they look like they're about to go and tear stuff up.",72,,
881,0.97,5719.88,5722.183,"And so, they had said they were all white folks.",72,,
882,0.97,5722.183,5725.386,"It was a bunch of white guys, in all black.",72,,
883,0.97,5725.386,5727.421,That is all I got.,72,,
884,0.97,5727.421,5739.834,"Basically, the one thing one of my guys said to me as he thought they came up from Portland, was what one of the guys said to me.",72,,
885,0.97,5739.834,5741.435,I do not know for sure about that.,72,,
886,0.97,5741.435,5745.106,"I am getting all of the second hand, I did not witness it, I did not see it.",72,,
887,0.97,5745.106,5749.944,"So don't take me to court on that, you know what I mean, but that is the information I got.",72,,
888,0.97,5749.944,5759.32,"If you notice when you start seeing all of the stuff that is happening, there was a lot of guys in black doing a lot of stuff, so I do not know.",72,,
889,0.97,5759.32,5761.956,I do not know if I can just Chime in here quick.,73,,
890,0.97,5761.956,5783.878,"But I did say, we've had time to review this footage, it is a nonstop, what I did see, on Saturday, because I'm always at the front with people, so we look at where the footage, and we try.",73,,
891,0.97,5783.878,5790.784,"As well, we come over there, get up in front of the barricade, and say something, this and that.",73,,
892,0.97,5790.784,5795.656,"Then, just disappear, kind of like rattling it.",73,,
893,0.97,5795.656,5797.391,I do not know vans and things like that.,73,,
894,0.97,5797.391,5802.163,But I have some people where it is just really weird.,73,,
895,0.97,5802.163,5807.401,"They come up there, and then, get up there in the front, trying to Riling everybody up.",73,,
896,0.97,5807.401,5818.712,"They could be organized, but that is what I'm seeing.",73,,
897,0.97,5820.481,5826.987,"Make a quick NOTE for all panelists, when you are speaking please try and turn your sound on your device off, so we cannot hear the Pings coming through.",74,,
898,0.97,5826.987,5829.423,Thanks Jake.,74,,
899,0.97,5829.423,5840.401,"Any other questions from Councilmembers before we move on to the panel with the police chief and, deputy Mayor and ire chief.",75,,
900,0.97,5840.401,5841.602,"Thank you again, to everybody.",76,,
901,0.97,5841.602,5858.052,"One of the things we had heard on Saturday, from a few folks who had reached out to other officers that they know, and this relates Dominique to your example as well.",76,,
902,0.97,5858.052,5866.327,"As we have heard from a few folks that they were very upset that they were being asked to go downtown and riot gear, especially given the tense nature of the protest across the country.",76,,
903,0.97,5866.327,5868.829,They were very concerned that that was the orders they had given.,76,,
904,0.97,5868.829,5875.669,We know that there was also an oath of office that is taken for duty to Disobey unlawful orders.,76,,
905,0.97,5875.669,5878.672,We take that very seriously when it comes to international situations.,76,,
906,0.97,5878.672,5881.976,"I'm wondering, Dominique.",76,,
907,0.97,5881.976,5904.965,"Could you comment a little bit more on Annie's stories or examples that you have heard from folks who were concerned about being deployed in the way that they were, or the type of, situations they were asked to be put in, or orders they were given from some of the folks you may have talked with as well.",76,,
908,0.97,5904.965,5907.801,Honestly I cannot really speak to that.,77,,
909,0.97,5907.801,5918.612,"What I can do, is speak to, conversations I have had with other law enforcement, and other cities.",77,,
910,0.97,5918.612,5935.396,"Outside of Washington, where, you talk about the psyche, that getting geared up and dressed up into military grade, warlike outfits, and stepping out.",77,,
911,0.97,5935.396,5943.337,"In a different psychological, when you step in, thinking I'm going into war, right.",77,,
912,0.97,5943.337,5946.206,"Now you are doing this, where you are facing your community.",77,,
913,0.97,5946.206,5952.646,And then the community SEES you just like that.,77,,
914,0.97,5952.646,5956.784,"And that has a psychological effect of seeing the officers, so you know there is a whole psychological situation going on.",77,,
915,0.97,5956.784,5965.059,"So I would love to have a conversation with SPD, that would be awesome.",77,,
916,0.97,5965.059,5971.732,"If community could sit down with SPD, and hear some of those officers, how they feel about getting dressed into the warlike tactical outfits.",77,,
917,0.97,5971.732,5982.509,And stepping out into the protest were most of them feel the same way as the people that are processing.,77,,
918,0.97,5982.509,5984.178,"That it was absolutely wrong, it was a tragedy.",77,,
919,0.97,5984.178,5999.993,"Now you standing there putting us against them as a message, and it hits it 10 times harder, because now you have tanks, now you have the reserves, now you have all of these weapons on you, now you are dressed in all of this gear.",77,,
920,0.97,5999.993,6003.897,"Now people, it divides us any, even more.",77,,
921,0.97,6003.897,6019.513,"If I was in charge of putting our officers out into the middle of this, I would be putting them out to the middle of this, to show compassion, and empathy, and build relationships.",77,,
922,0.97,6019.513,6020.314,That would diffuse everything.,77,,
923,0.97,6020.314,6031.125,"And then, what would happen is, the community would side with law enforcement when people start rioting.",77,,
924,0.97,6031.125,6032.926,There is only a small portion of people writing.,77,,
925,0.97,6032.926,6037.765,"The community would literally stop that, because they would feel a connection with law enforcement.",77,,
926,0.97,6037.765,6041.135,"These guys get us, they get them, they know why we are out here.",77,,
927,0.97,6041.135,6044.638,"We want justice, we want inequality.",77,,
928,0.97,6044.638,6050.544,"People are staring, tearing stuff up.",77,,
929,0.97,6050.544,6061.955,"You can see the handful of people tearing stuff up, the cost mayhem, Teargas, rubber bullets, everybody is running everywhere, you cannot distinguish the handfuls of pockets of people that really opted to do damage.",77,,
930,0.97,6061.955,6074.635,"So I hear you, I kind of went in a different direction but I would love to have a conversation, if that would be set up, would be more than happy to sit out and have a conversation, how officers feel when they have to step out with military equipment.",77,,
931,0.97,6074.635,6081.108,Councilmembers so want to believe you had another quick item.,78,,
932,0.97,6081.108,6082.643,Thank you so much.,79,,
933,0.97,6082.643,6085.579,"On the consent decree, I forgot to add an important thing.",79,,
934,0.97,6085.579,6115.609,"As I was saying earlier, 35+ organizations, among them are Naacp, one America, real change, have signed a letter together, demanding that the Mayor withdraw her recommendation for lifting the consent decree, and many community leaders have signed that as well.",79,,
935,0.97,6115.609,6131.492,"They sent all Councilmember offices, and I am really looking forward to your responses, to see if you will sign onto that with me, the letter basically urges the Mayor, to not file her petition for consent decree, and that it needs to be maintained.",79,,
936,0.97,6131.492,6138.131,"I just wanted to share, I'm happy to share that Councilmembers have already let me know she is signing onto that letter.",79,,
937,0.97,6138.131,6138.932,I greatly appreciate that.,79,,
938,0.97,6138.932,6144.438,I look forward to responses from other Council offices.,79,,
939,0.97,6144.438,6148.442,"If there any suggested changes you want to make to the letter, I am happy to look at those.",79,,
940,0.97,6148.442,6150.544,Please have your staff reach out to my staff.,79,,
941,0.97,6150.544,6153.747,Councilmember Strauss.,80,,
942,0.97,6153.747,6159.853,Thank you.,81,,
943,0.97,6159.853,6163.524,"To you and the panelists, I was late to this meeting because I was watching the CPC meeting.",81,,
944,0.97,6163.524,6165.959,In Transitioning here into the office.,81,,
945,0.97,6165.959,6168.362,I was listening through our Council listen line the entire time.,81,,
946,0.97,6168.362,6175.068,"Also, thanks Jake for your reporting.",81,,
947,0.97,6175.068,6179.573,"I have been, I feel like I know you very well because I've been listening to your voice for a couple nights now.",81,,
948,0.97,6179.573,6181.808,I was up with you until about 1:30 in the morning.,81,,
949,0.97,6181.808,6182.476,Last night.,81,,
950,0.97,6182.476,6186.079,So thanks Jake for your reporting.,81,,
951,0.97,6186.079,6196.056,"What is clear to me, is that the proportionality of response, is not consistent with the aggression from people exercising their first amendment rights.",81,,
952,0.97,6196.056,6216.41,"What I saw last night, and I look forward to the OPA, and Oig and their investigations into these complaints, because I am glad that we have a process, and I want to see the process play through what I personally witnessed, was a day of peaceful protest.",81,,
953,0.97,6216.41,6221.882,"A day of peaceful exercising the first amendment rights, that was the beginning to wrap up, aunts, and chanting you go home, we go home.",81,,
954,0.97,6221.882,6234.027,"Which I have to say, your analysis on De-Escalation tactics have been very helpful.",81,,
955,0.97,6234.027,6255.649,"I watched as this crowd was beginning, was De-Escalating a situation, and for, a very small portion of the group, on the fringe, on the edge of the group to throw water bottles to have the response at that time the gas, flash bangs, pepper Springs, pepper sprays.",81,,
956,0.97,6255.649,6263.256,"I don't need an investigation to understand, that that is out of balance.",81,,
957,0.97,6263.256,6268.562,We do not need to be using military grade weapons on the people of our fair city.,81,,
958,0.97,6268.562,6282.376,"There is not a place for military grade weapons on our streets, much like in my work, and trying to reduce gun violence, we know that when you add more gusto situation, there is a more, a higher likelihood of gun violence.",81,,
959,0.97,6282.376,6287.648,It is of the same here.,81,,
960,0.97,6287.648,6299.993,"We need to reduce the amount of military grade weapons that are on our streets, to reduce the amount of harm that is being done to people, the gas Seeps into people's homes.",81,,
961,0.97,6299.993,6306.099,We don't have a place for military grade weapons on our streets.,81,,
962,0.97,6306.099,6314.107,"My oversight, having watched the live streams of countless people watching those cameras throughout the city, clearly has not been enough.",81,,
963,0.97,6314.107,6327.32,"So, what is your recommendation, and Dominique, and anyone else on the call, what is your recommendation that needs to be done today, to De-Escalate tonight.",81,,
964,0.97,6327.32,6335.529,"We don't have more time, to reduce the likelihood of military grade weapons being used on our streets.",81,,
965,0.97,6335.529,6337.631,What does our city need to do today.,81,,
966,0.97,6337.631,6341.101,What do I need to do today.,81,,
967,0.97,6341.101,6348.608,"What you need to do today, is if police feel uncomfortable Barricading us six feet.",82,,
968,0.97,6348.608,6351.845,"One, there was no known distance before Saturday.",82,,
969,0.97,6351.845,6354.347,"Two, or Monday.",82,,
970,0.97,6354.347,6355.782,There was no distance.,82,,
971,0.97,6355.782,6366.46,"Yesterday, after a lot of discussion by the public, and maybe by the police to, they put themselves six feet behind the barricade.",82,,
972,0.97,6366.46,6370.964,"You know if you are in the barricades, that is the front line.",82,,
973,0.97,6370.964,6374.434,"For them, they can move back even further behind the barricade.",82,,
974,0.97,6374.434,6379.673,"It is easier to move 50 officers back, then it is 500,000 people.",82,,
975,0.97,6379.673,6389.449,"I think the Seattle police, it gives the maximum amount of low anxiety.",82,,
976,0.97,6389.449,6390.584,You know what I am saying.,82,,
977,0.97,6390.584,6406.967,"And that's, to be honest with you, that protest went, it was rocking for a long time very peacefully because of the distance, and we showed on the stream, that that six foot, that was there on Monday, even an umbrella, it would have been too far from the officer to even grab the umbrella, right.",82,,
978,0.97,6406.967,6415.375,"So maybe set up something, so that you set up a barricade that does not raise their anxiety.",82,,
979,0.97,6415.375,6421.915,"Their anxiety is really, kind of what everybody needs to.",82,,
980,0.97,6421.915,6428.221,It is them being high anxiety that a water bottle can get this disproportionate response.,82,,
981,0.97,6428.221,6433.059,"They need more space, they can see a water bottle coming in through, I cannot say somebody is not going to throw something.",82,,
982,0.97,6433.059,6435.929,"The further away from the Protester, that is one thing right there.",82,,
983,0.97,6435.929,6452.646,"But, the biggest thing, the second thing, could be bigger, or not, is that you guys as the city Council, the city of Chit, you guys need to determine today what kind of cities Seattle is.",82,,
984,0.97,6452.646,6474.467,"The associated press calling me, there is all kinds of, this is going, it is up to you guys right now, the city Council, the Mayor, the chief of police, to make a determination of what kind of cities Seattle is going to be.",82,,
985,0.97,6474.467,6478.972,"Is this the kind of city that this goes on here, on and on, because some cities are just known for that.",82,,
986,0.97,6478.972,6481.041,"That is a tough County, do not go over there.",82,,
987,0.97,6481.041,6483.276,"If that is what is going to be, let Seattle own it.",82,,
988,0.97,6483.276,6493.386,"If this is not what Seattle is and who Seattle is, then you guys need to make a determination and come together as a city Council, as a Mayor, as a police chief, to say this is not who we are.",82,,
989,0.97,6493.386,6497.257,"There needs to be a step up, another thing I know I'm long- winded, I will stop here.",82,,
990,0.97,6497.257,6501.895,The street level is a vacuum of invisible leadership.,82,,
991,0.97,6501.895,6504.598,We are not seeing it.,82,,
992,0.97,6504.598,6514.307,"When crisis creates an opportunity, is an opportunity for leaders to step up and shine bright.",82,,
993,0.97,6514.307,6515.742,People are not seeing the leadership there.,82,,
994,0.97,6515.742,6533.493,"As for today, set up a barricade different, barricade distance that makes them comfortable, brings down their anxiety.",82,,
995,0.97,6533.493,6539.933,"This is a really helpful Segway, for us to move to hear from the Mayor's office, and hear from both our police and fire Chiefs.",83,,
996,0.97,6539.933,6543.003,"I want to recognize, that I heard you last night, calling for leadership.",83,,
997,0.97,6543.003,6547.24,"From my home, in West Seattle.",83,,
998,0.97,6547.24,6553.747,"And, I considered coming down to join you.",83,,
999,0.97,6553.747,6556.449,I did not know how much time I had to do so.,83,,
1000,0.97,6556.449,6559.92,It was pretty clear things were wrapping up by the time I got on.,83,,
1001,0.97,6559.92,6569.162,"But I wish I had, and if there is another opportunity for me to come down and help, I will do so.",83,,
1002,0.97,6569.162,6574.668,"I really honor everyone's courage today for joining us, and I deeply appreciate the work that each of you are doing in your communities to fight justice.",83,,
1003,0.97,6574.668,6577.304,"I apologize for the harm to your heart, your body, and your soul.",83,,
1004,0.97,6577.304,6584.578,From the experiences of living as a black person in America.,83,,
1005,0.97,6584.578,6589.95,"I pledge that this committee will center your experiences as we determine a path forward, towards police accountability.",83,,
1006,0.97,6589.95,6592.185,Thank you so much.,83,,
1007,0.97,6592.185,6595.088,I would like to say something really quickly.,84,,
1008,0.97,6595.088,6598.692,Absolutely.,85,,
1009,0.97,6598.692,6622.949,"Specifically in terms of what can be done to make these protests more safe, would be more, we actually need oversight and accountability in terms of how these officers that are shown to be using excessive force on peaceful protesters, we need an actual understanding that those people will be fired, that there will be consequences for their actions.",86,,
1010,0.97,6622.949,6629.723,"Not vague suggestions about, we need actual accountability as far as that goes.",86,,
1011,0.97,6629.723,6634.194,"The fact that there is no punishment, and it is allowing the officers to do whatever they want.",86,,
1012,0.97,6634.194,6644.738,There need to be consequences.,86,,
1013,0.97,6645.472,6650.644,"Thank you, we do have our accountability partners on, after the Mayor's office, and the fire and police chief to talk about the accountability process.",87,,
1014,0.97,6650.644,6661.988,"And, how they make recommendations for discipline.",87,,
1015,0.97,6663.123,6669.729,"And a little bit of a status reports, on the complaints they have received it now, and maybe some changes, for how they do their investigations in a way that involves community more.",87,,
1016,0.97,6669.729,6670.363,Thank you again.,87,,
1017,0.97,6670.363,6675.035,"Will the clerk please read from item number two, into the record.",87,,
1018,0.97,6675.035,6679.272,"Just to clarify, I meant community accountability.",88,,
1019,0.97,6679.272,6682.442,There is no accountability when it is organizations that work with each other.,88,,
1020,0.97,6682.442,6692.485,"Appreciate the clarity, thank you.",89,,
1021,0.97,6692.485,6704.664,"If you do not mind, I just want to follow-up on what she said and say I really agree with what she is saying.",90,,
1022,0.97,6704.664,6711.404,"Existing structures are not bringing accountability, and I cannot agree more with what she said, we need an independent community led investigation, and we need consequences, disciplining or firing of the officers involved.",90,,
1023,0.97,6711.404,6730.724,"I'm sorry, that is what I was meaning to explain, when, because I've heard the calls for a community driven investigation process, and so, director Andrew Meyer Berg is going to talk about some ideas, that he has, that he and I have talked about to center community, in that investigation process.",91,,
1024,0.97,6730.724,6736.996,A little differently than we have done before.,91,,
1025,0.97,6736.996,6746.106,"I really do hope, we can move on, I am concerned that we are not going to have the Mayor's office for the full hour, that we have scheduled.",91,,
1026,0.97,6746.106,6751.244,"So, Alex, can you please read item 2 into the record.",91,,
1027,0.97,6751.244,6754.647,Agenda item number two.,92,,

1029,0.97,6757.65,6774.501,"Thank you, we are joined by chief Carmen best, Harold Scoggins, and Andre Madea.",93,,
1030,0.97,6777.237,6783.91,Our concerns about the city's response to demonstrations protesting the murder of George Floyd and the death and injury of black people at the hands of law enforcement and our city for generations.,93,,
1031,0.97,6783.91,6787.981,Does not obscure the recognition of the first responders in these challenging times.,93,,
1032,0.97,6787.981,6792.152,"Councilmembers, our panel will not be able to Opine on complaints of actions of individual officers.",93,,
1033,0.97,6792.152,6798.458,I'm not suggesting you do not speak about the actions of individual officers that you're aware of.,93,,
1034,0.97,6798.458,6810.303,I'm only managing expectations of whether or not our panel will be able to respond to those questions about those individual complaints.,93,,
1035,0.97,6810.303,6816.309,"Again, my request of Councilmembers is to please hold your questions for panelists until the end of all of the panel presentations and then we will take your questions.",93,,
1036,0.97,6816.309,6819.579,First we will hear from senior deputy Mayor Fong.,93,,
1037,0.97,6819.579,6823.516,"Good afternoon, and Councilmembers.",94,,
1038,0.97,6823.516,6840.7,"Before I begin with some brief remarks, I also want to thank your panel this afternoon, this is some very informative perspectives, and voices that need to be heard, as part of this conversation and discussion.",94,,
1039,0.97,6840.7,6859.953,"I will also, mention as you have, Councilmember Herbold, I too listened to quite some time to his broadcast last night and found it also enlightening, as far as our continued dialogue around this issue, so thank you for that.",94,,
1040,0.97,6859.953,6870.263,"Again, also thank you for inviting the executive to the committee this afternoon to discuss events that have unfolded over the last several days.",94,,
1041,0.97,6870.263,6873.266,"I do want to start, by just echoing the Mayor's repeated remarks.",94,,
1042,0.97,6873.266,6890.65,"And of those from members of the Council and community, that the many voices that are demanding real institutional and systemic change around racism in equities and injustice, must be heard.",94,,
1043,0.97,6890.65,6899.692,"Residence across Seattle, continue to gather, to express their frustration, and anger, about the unjust killing of George Floyd.",94,,
1044,0.97,6899.692,6904.163,"It is their right to gather, and we think them for speaking out.",94,,
1045,0.97,6904.163,6916.776,"As a city, it is our duty and responsibility, to protect those peacefully protesting, as they exercise their freedoms.",94,,
1046,0.97,6916.776,6922.415,"So, I want to just anchor our conversation this afternoon, and a couple key priorities that I know the Council and the executives share.",94,,
1047,0.97,6922.415,6935.628,"And that is, that we are committed together to dismantling the systemic inequities and injustices that have persisted for so long in our society, and continue today.",94,,
1048,0.97,6935.628,6942.402,"And yes, that absolutely includes government Constructs and institutions.",94,,
1049,0.97,6942.402,6949.642,"And, we are deeply committed together to the first amendment right to free speech and assembly.",94,,
1050,0.97,6949.642,6957.85,"And, we will protect the safety of everyone, demonstrators, and our broader community.",94,,
1051,0.97,6957.85,6961.654,We are committed to transparency and accountability.,94,,
1052,0.97,6961.654,6984.077,"On this point, I know you will be hearing from them later this afternoon, but I deeply believe that the many years of hard work, by so many, including the Mayor and many of you to craft such a strong and fair system of accountability for officer conduct, will be tested.",94,,
1053,0.97,6984.077,6989.482,But I truly believe that the system will endure.,94,,
1054,0.97,6989.482,7012.071,"I would also emphasize that the Mayor herself, has been instrumental, in helping to ensure the strong civilian oversight components of our accounting system, but also the integrity, and the independence of the OPA and Oig, in their investigative and oversight roles.",94,,
1055,0.97,7012.071,7016.709,"The hallmark of our system, has always been a willingness, and an openness, to continuous improvement.",94,,
1056,0.97,7016.709,7023.182,"And this administration is committed, to that principle.",94,,
1057,0.97,7023.182,7051.844,"As you heard even from the Mayor in the last few days, we have discussed further examination of issues, such as badges and badge numbers, but as well as, body camps, and other issues that have come up, and I know many members of this Council, and many members of the community, and the previous administrations, have worked so hard, to establish protocols and procedures, four.",94,,
1058,0.97,7051.844,7062.555,"Given the issues that have arisen, there is definitely an openness, and eagerness on our parts, that we invite the Council and community into that conversation, once again.",94,,
1059,0.97,7062.555,7071.13,"As you know, Mayor Durkan is one of the original signers of the consent decree nearly 10 years ago.",94,,
1060,0.97,7071.13,7087.78,"While progress has been made and we are deeply proud of the progress as she said yesterday, there is much more that needs to be done, and more voices need to be heard from the community as we center around that endeavor.",94,,
1061,0.97,7087.78,7094.687,"So, I will close briefly, today we are here to talk to some of the actions related to the city's response since last Friday.",94,,
1062,0.97,7094.687,7111.304,"I want to reinforce, that much of this information is still preliminary in our operations, are still ongoing, with the many dedicated city employees and public servants down in the emergency operations center, as we speak.",94,,
1063,0.97,7111.304,7122.915,"As with any major incident, we will ultimately develop a full after action report, when we can evaluate, assess lessons learned, and pursue continuous improvement.",94,,
1064,0.97,7122.915,7126.819,We welcome this dialogue with the Council.,94,,
1065,0.97,7126.819,7131.824,"Today is the beginning of that conversation, going forward.",94,,
1066,0.97,7131.824,7138.431,"With that, I will turn our presentation and discussion over to chief best.",94,,
1067,0.97,7138.431,7141.334,"As well as a few other cabinet members, for our presentation this afternoon.",94,,

1248,0.97,8304.362,8306.698,"But, what happened during many recent events was not fighting back.",99,,
1249,0.97,8306.698,8309.367,It was actually attacking.,99,,
1250,0.97,8309.367,8311.67,"Not everybody, not even most people.",99,,
1251,0.97,8311.67,8313.405,But some people were attacking.,99,,

1324,0.97,8698.99,8700.358,It is important that you know that.,101,,

1326,0.97,8713.204,8718.91,"Our goal, was to support the protest, while continuing to serve the community.",101,,
1327,0.97,8718.91,8726.084,We had to do that in a couple of different ways.,101,,
1328,0.97,8726.084,8727.819,We knew the crowds were going to be large.,101,,
1329,0.97,8727.819,8730.721,"As with all protests, they're going to be trips and falls and things like that.",101,,
1330,0.97,8730.721,8733.091,What was happening around the nation made this a bit different.,101,,
1331,0.97,8733.091,8740.898,"So we wanted to make sure we had appropriate resources, to deal with any medical emergencies or fire emergencies.",101,,
1332,0.97,8740.898,8744.135,As all of you have seen around the nation there been many fires burning.,101,,
1333,0.97,8744.135,8749.24,We did not want to get caught short.,101,,
1334,0.97,8749.24,8750.208,We did a few different things.,101,,
1335,0.97,8750.208,8760.017,"We staffed up additional fire engines on Saturday, we staffed up five additional fire engines and strategically located them around the community.",101,,
1336,0.97,8760.017,8780.972,"Because, what we knew was, we were going to have the normal fire calls, to come in and on Saturday we had probably 200 to 250 with the most significant being a structure fire on Capitol Hill, and another structure file, fire in Seattle.",101,,
1337,0.97,8780.972,8781.839,Having the extra resources helped.,101,,
1338,0.97,8781.839,8790.381,"As the events escalated on Saturday and the fire started growing around the community, our goal is to get in there, and put the fires out.",101,,
1339,0.97,8790.381,8803.394,"If it was a Trashcan fire, vehicle fire, we did not want that fire Transitioning from a structure to a building.",101,,
1340,0.97,8803.394,8804.629,That becomes very important for us.,101,,
1341,0.97,8804.629,8809.901,"We knew it was going to be challenging to get in there, which is why we had a lot of help, and a lot of units.",101,,
1342,0.97,8809.901,8817.408,"I do want to thank the Seattle police Department, the sheriff's Department or providing us escorts, and getting us a way to get in there and put those fires out.",101,,
1343,0.97,8817.408,8820.511,"Some of them reignited, and we got back in there and put them out again.",101,,
1344,0.97,8820.511,8827.618,"On Saturday, we had a total of 33 calls, that were related in and around the protest.",101,,
1345,0.97,8827.618,8830.221,"Eight of those were vehicle fires, that you saw.",101,,
1346,0.97,8830.221,8838.729,And our firefighters did an amazing job and working around the clock.,101,,
1347,0.97,8838.729,8843.1,"As we moved into Sunday, also, with Saturday, as things escalated, we did call for additional resources.",101,,
1348,0.97,8843.1,8855.046,"We called for our neighbors to come and help us, just in case one of these large buildings got going in the downtown core.",101,,
1349,0.97,8855.046,8857.915,We wanted to make sure we had enough help to really attack those fires.,101,,
1350,0.97,8857.915,8859.717,Our King County neighbor sent additional engines to help.,101,,
1351,0.97,8859.717,8864.956,"We had a plan that was moving forward with the state mobilization in case larger structures got going, and we had a number of them going.",101,,
1352,0.97,8864.956,8868.459,"That was Saturday, moving into Sunday.",101,,
1353,0.97,8868.459,8872.93,"Once again, we stood up our resource management center, and we staffed additional engines for Sunday.",101,,
1354,0.97,8872.93,8878.569,When a total of 22 responses in and around the protest area.,101,,
1355,0.97,8878.569,8890.514,"And then moving into Monday, the same format continued, we had 18 responses, in and around the protest area, and I believe Monday was the University village.",101,,
1356,0.97,8890.514,8891.182,So we have separation.,101,,
1357,0.97,8891.182,8899.991,We had large geographical separation at that point.,101,,
1358,0.97,8899.991,8905.796,"So we strategically relocated our resources around there, just in case anything happened around University village.",101,,
1359,0.97,8905.796,8914.572,We wanted to make sure we had enough resources in a close proximity to put those fires out or for medically related responses.,101,,
1360,0.97,8914.572,8919.81,"We did have a medically related response that was really significant and I'm glad we were close, to get the person help, that really needed help.",101,,
1361,0.97,8919.81,8921.479,And that was significant.,101,,
1362,0.97,8921.479,8931.389,"Last night, our units once again monitored the groups that were moving around, and we were ready, and we had nine responses between yesterday, and into the night last night.",101,,
1363,0.97,8931.389,8946.203,"Our team has been working extremely hard, and I do want to thank the members of the Seattle fire Department, they have been going nonstop for a very long time.",101,,
1364,0.97,8946.203,8947.438,Not just the last seven days.,101,,
1365,0.97,8947.438,8949.84,"We have not Telework, we have not done any of those things.",101,,
1366,0.97,8949.84,8965.523,"We have responded to more emergencies that have probably been more frightening than many of our members have responded to in their careers, because there was an unseen pandemic and they were afraid of what they were taking home to their families.",101,,
1367,0.97,8965.523,8970.661,"We have been going steady for a very long time, and I do want to commend them, because they have been working extremely hard.",101,,

1425,0.97,9345.803,9369.96,"I want to preface this line of questions that Councilmember Herbold queued up, by acknowledging I am not a likely candidate for this line of questioning based on my background in law enforcement, and based on the fact that I am friends with many police officers, my best friend growing up, though I was the best friend at his wedding, is a police officer.",105,,
1426,0.97,9369.96,9378.469,"I believe that policing can be done constitutionally, and in collaboration with the community.",105,,
1427,0.97,9378.469,9382.639,"But, I wanted a line of questioning here, I think that can only happen, if we do follow the rules.",105,,
1428,0.97,9382.639,9400.591,"And follow the rules in real time, and acknowledge that the rules that are so proud of that are shaped by years of being in our consent decree, are rules that should be shaping behavior in real time, not something to set up accountability later, and that is what Councilmember Herbold just touched on.",105,,

1432,0.97,9424.581,9428.786,"I think these rules that matter most, when law enforcement is present, to protect first amendment event center activities.",105,,
1433,0.97,9428.786,9431.288,I'm going to jump into this line of questioning.,105,,
1434,0.97,9431.288,9434.625,They are mostly going to pertain to Monday nights events.,105,,
1435,0.97,9434.625,9440.431,"I do just want to flag for everybody, that is viewing at home.",105,,
1436,0.97,9440.431,9452.843,"I am not singling out Monday nights events, purely to suggest that those are the only events that are concerning over the last several days.",105,,
1437,0.97,9452.843,9453.644,I'm not doing that.,105,,
1438,0.97,9453.644,9474.631,"But I do want to particularly drilling, because it is one we have some of the most photographic examples, of the use of some of our crowd control rules, and I want to preface this by presenting, a Video that was made, and we will play it muted.",105,,
1439,0.97,9474.631,9485.342,"Before we start, I want to preface for people who are viewing at home, we are on a live stream, there is, it is a fairly graphic Video.",105,,
1440,0.97,9485.342,9489.379,I do just want to give a warning to the viewing public.,105,,
1441,0.97,9489.379,9493.884,I would ask of the chairs indulgence we play this Video briefly before we proceed with the line of question.,105,,
1442,0.97,9493.884,9496.486,"I wholeheartedly support this, thank you.",106,,
1443,0.97,9496.486,9498.889,I will play this muted as I said.,107,,
1444,0.97,9498.889,9505.229,So if you could go ahead and play the video.,107,,
1445,0.97,9646.37,9650.307,"Thank you for playing that, Joseph.",108,,
1446,0.97,9650.307,9655.746,"I know that is a difficult thing for everybody, here to watch.",108,,
1447,0.97,9655.746,9658.348,"First, as a Foundational question, before I get into the rest of them.",108,,
1448,0.97,9658.348,9665.455,"I just want to ask, have you reviewed that Video, previously?",108,,
1449,0.97,9665.455,9674.264,"Councilmember, Lewis.",109,,
1450,0.97,9674.264,9674.631,Thank you.,109,,
1451,0.97,9674.631,9679.102,"I have seen, maybe not that specific Video but many versions of the Video and the incident that occurred on Monday.",109,,
1452,0.97,9679.102,9688.845,"In the clash between officers and some of the protesters, there has been a number of folks, who have issued concerns and complaints in this regard.",109,,
1453,0.97,9688.845,9690.781,So I've heard it from a number of different perspectives.,109,,
1454,0.97,9690.781,9702.492,It is already being reviewed by the office of police accountability and director Myerberg.,109,,
1455,0.97,9702.492,9707.998,"There are various versions about what occurred, we want to get to the facts of every piece of this, and as he said it is very disturbing.",109,,
1456,0.97,9707.998,9712.602,"No one wants to see pepper spray, or Teargas or anything else being deployed.",109,,
1457,0.97,9712.602,9718.675,"At the same time, I think there's probably underlying issues as to why that occurred, and I want to make sure we know what they are.",109,,
1458,0.97,9718.675,9724.181,"Chief, if I may speak to that a little bit, further down the line.",110,,
1459,0.97,9724.181,9726.616,"I appreciate, I appreciate that.",110,,
1460,0.97,9726.616,9735.525,"I want to jump into it, because, these are ongoing demonstrations.",110,,
1461,0.97,9735.525,9738.462,"I do not want us to wait, all the way until the final formal review.",110,,
1462,0.97,9738.462,9741.031,I want to touch on a couple elements of what we see here.,110,,
1463,0.97,9741.031,9744.334,I probably would not be doing this if it was just what we have seen here.,110,,
1464,0.97,9744.334,9761.785,"The fact it has been Commiserated, and it has been relayed to me, by, dozens of friends, who were present, who witnessed this, who are readily concerned.",110,,
1465,0.97,9761.785,9767.457,It was determined to be a riot by the incident command.,110,,
1466,0.97,9767.457,9769.726,Want to get into a little bit of a definition of that.,110,,
1467,0.97,9769.726,9771.361,We have a definition of placement override.,110,,
1468,0.97,9771.361,9778.468,It is 14 point 09098.,110,,
1469,0.97,9778.468,9780.771,Causing injury to any person or substantial harm to property.,110,,
1470,0.97,9780.771,9791.448,"So, the first question I want to say, is the response called for, if it is determined that that element is present, right.",110,,
1471,0.97,9791.448,9798.488,If the crowd is to be ordered to disperse.,110,,
1472,0.97,9798.488,9801.358,"First I want to make sure and correct on that, am I correct?",110,,
1473,0.97,9801.358,9803.793,"Yes, as he read it you are absolutely right.",111,,
1474,0.97,9803.793,9809.099,"The being a former city attorney, you know that as well as anybody that yes, that is correct.",111,,
1475,0.97,9809.099,9809.699,Thank you.,112,,
1476,0.97,9809.699,9822.312,"Going onto the next session, before you order the crowd to disperse, the incident commander that is in charge considers less restrictive means of crowd management then considering telling the crowd to disperse.",112,,
1477,0.97,9822.312,9823.48,I'm sorry.,113,,
1478,0.97,9823.48,9831.288,They consider less restrictive means of crowd management then giving the order to disperse.,114,,
1479,0.97,9831.288,9841.131,We try to use the least Invasive force before we issue a dispersal order.,115,,
1480,0.97,9841.131,9857.247,"Right, so I guess my question is, and maybe this is a premature question for the review, but from reviewing the tapes, you know, like what happened on Saturday night in downtown Seattle, will be the first to say, that was a riot.",116,,
1481,0.97,9857.247,9861.718,"That was out of control, there were vehicles that were burning, there were buildings being looted.",116,,
1482,0.97,9861.718,9886.076,"It seemed that, the events we just saw on tape, and from what I have heard from other folks who are presently there, who were chanting, actually Ironically we do not see no riot here, please take off your riot gear, I'm having a hard time seeing how that could be labeled a riot.",116,,
1483,0.97,9886.076,9888.078,"Okay Councilmember, thank you very much for that.",117,,
1484,0.97,9888.078,9902.058,"I appreciate your perspective with her basis of knowledge about the law, and one of the things we will be reviewing, is if in fact there was a riot, all of those tenants will be looked at, again, by officers of police accountability.",117,,
1485,0.97,9902.058,9920.41,"If there is a dispute about if in fact there was a riot, or what occurred first, I am sure that director Meyer will be looking at the camera, video collected from the area, policies, procedures and a Seattle municipal code, anything else that might affect the actions of what happened that night.",117,,
1486,0.97,9920.41,9929.819,"Agreed, it should all be looked into, but not for me to answer at this very moment, because I'm not the expert that is going to be look at the police accountability part of this.",117,,
1487,0.97,9929.819,9934.024,"Right, I guess, to build on that, too.",118,,
1488,0.97,9934.024,9942.399,"We played the Video muted, but even playing the Video with the sound, and the Video from multiple different angles that have been submitted from other people.",118,,
1489,0.97,9942.399,9949.039,"There was not, once the determination was made an order to disperse.",118,,
1490,0.97,9949.039,9952.909,"I guess my question is, to the Department lacks the means to provide an order to disperse?",118,,
1491,0.97,9952.909,9963.253,"In some cases, that is the case, when, SMC as you know is pretty clear about, when it is feasible, to do so.",119,,
1492,0.97,9963.253,9976.666,"So if the people on scene, the commander on scene feels like it is not visible at that time for a whole host of different conditions, there is a possibility they will not give an order to disperse.",119,,
1493,0.97,9976.666,9981.371,"Again, all of that will be looked at, reviewed.",119,,
1494,0.97,9981.371,9985.608,I know that Councilmember Herbold in particular who I greatly respect her thoughts and opinions on these matters wants to look forward.,119,,
1495,0.97,9985.608,9994.384,We have to sort of look back at the incident before we can answer forward how we might move in a different or better direction if one is warranted.,119,,
1496,0.97,9994.384,9995.352,I appreciate that.,120,,
1497,0.97,9995.352,10004.761,"My concern is I want to make sure we take the opportunity that I'm hearing today, to drill in some of the things that happened so far and what is an ongoing round of demonstrations in the city.",120,,
1498,0.97,10004.761,10015.872,"I am leaning on some of these points, because I think that we have seen over the last couple of days, the Differene between a riot and Rioter.",120,,
1499,0.97,10015.872,10018.508,Saturday night in downtown Seattle as I alluded earlier was a riot.,120,,
1500,0.97,10018.508,10022.012,"We saw it on TV, we saw what happened.",120,,
1501,0.97,10022.012,10057.113,"But, if an assembly like the one that was there on Monday, which was overwhelmingly by all accounts peaceful, included a couple of folks who were being disruptive, who were, by some accounts throwing stuff at the police line, I don't want us to be in a position where, we don't have any means of De- escalating the confrontation with a couple of individuals, so that those couple of individuals can in turn veto the demonstration of, hundreds of peaceful demonstrators.",120,,
1502,0.97,10057.113,10068.458,"You know, people that I had in the demonstration who were friends of mine, who were assisted to Attorney General, they were not rioters.",120,,
1503,0.97,10068.458,10075.231,"Right, they were there to peacefully demonstrate.",120,,
1504,0.97,10075.231,10078.968,"And, they were not told to disperse and they were hit with tear gas and flash bang grenades.",120,,
1505,0.97,10078.968,10091.181,"It is just a matter, that the tactics that are being used and are starting to present and there was an editorial in the New York Times about this today.",120,,
1506,0.97,10091.181,10093.283,There is a fundamental right to free expression and assembly.,120,,
1507,0.97,10093.283,10102.192,Cities have an obligation to be maintaining.,120,,
1508,0.97,10102.192,10116.406,"If we can allow a few people to round up the peaceful constitutional demonstration, to the point where we are deploying weapons to break it up, we are failing our obligation as a city to allow people to exercise a fundamental right to free expression and demonstration.",120,,
1509,0.97,10116.406,10120.31,That was my the speech I guess the question.,120,,
1510,0.97,10120.31,10124.38,It leads me to the next question about command and control of the weapons that we have in the field.,120,,
1511,0.97,10124.38,10130.62,"So I want to start with a couple of Foundational questions, so OC spray, commonly known as pepper spray.",120,,
1512,0.97,10130.62,10134.624,Lesser lethal authorized for crowd control.,120,,
1513,0.97,10134.624,10136.392,As our glass balls.,120,,
1514,0.97,10136.392,10145.435,"Is that the same thing as a flash bring, flash bang grenade.",120,,
1515,0.97,10145.435,10146.636,"Yes, it can be.",121,,
1516,0.97,10146.636,10160.75,"The manual again, under this directive, they can only be used at the direction of the incident commander unless are specific conditions the better President.",122,,
1517,0.97,10160.75,10161.518,Present.,122,,
1518,0.97,10161.518,10162.619,Under the manual.,122,,
1519,0.97,10162.619,10169.225,"Yes, sir.",123,,
1520,0.97,10169.225,10175.165,"Does conditions, there has to be, someone can use those for self-defense in certain circumstances, an officer can, if there is an immediate life safety emergency.",124,,
1521,0.97,10175.165,10189.179,"But even then, personnel should a ploy, avoid deploying those.",124,,
1522,0.97,10189.812,10190.58,Per the manual.,124,,
1523,0.97,10190.58,10200.089,"So in fact, and under section, you know under the section that I enumerated earlier, set out earlier.",124,,
1524,0.97,10200.089,10208.464,An officer can use that spray for the self-defense of the fence of the public are there required to verbally warn the person that though spray will be used.,124,,
1525,0.97,10208.464,10210.9,Even in the cases of crowd control.,124,,
1526,0.97,10210.9,10214.304,With a reasonable amount of time for compliance with the warning.,124,,
1527,0.97,10214.304,10216.172,This is Ideally if they can limit the collateral exposure.,124,,
1528,0.97,10216.172,10220.376,That is what is required.,124,,
1529,0.97,10220.376,10231.22,"So, part of my concern, and the reason I bring that line of questioning up, is that, what I've been hearing from a lot of folks that are out there.",124,,
1530,0.97,10231.22,10263.253,"We have demonstrated in the past who are damaged, have been politically active, or not sensing the taunts and the sort of give and take of the normal rules of protest, who are being observed, they're not anticipating police escalation, they're not anticipating this use of force, in a way, that they have been in typically situated demonstrations in the past in Seattle.",124,,
1531,0.97,10263.253,10284.374,"I am bringing that up, because I want, if these are going to be ongoing demonstrations, I want the temple of these demonstrations to reflect the level of escalation of force, that protesters in the city are prone to accept over time, and one that honestly in the past, that the Department has had very good reputation of implement.",124,,
1532,0.97,10284.374,10302.592,"So, I just wanted to ask if you have any response to that observation from folks that we all of us on the counselor getting from people, that are surprised, frankly, actually, by this use of force at their Extrinsic at this demonstration.",124,,
1533,0.97,10302.592,10307.563,Think you Councilmember Lewis.,125,,
1534,0.97,10307.563,10309.799,The forces must be used to protect life and property.,125,,
1535,0.97,10309.799,10311.2,Including life and property of the officers.,125,,
1536,0.97,10311.2,10320.109,I know there will be a thorough review.,125,,
1537,0.97,10320.109,10328.718,"We have a very clear knowledge, and honestly they have stated, what the policy of the Miscible code present.",125,,

1539,0.97,10338.695,10340.496,They need to be made for those issues.,125,,
1540,0.97,10340.496,10369.158,"I can tell you one of the things that we have done, in light of the event on Monday night, we felt like, possibly needed to have an additional, I believe, I believe they mentioned earlier in the comments to Council, an additional line there, barricade, that creates a little bit more distance, between officers and the crowd, so there is a little more time to determine if in fact, there is a need to disperse, or need to react with any sort of munitions.",125,,
1541,0.97,10369.158,10383.139,"Again, all of that will be reviewed, we did take an immediate adjustment to that, we did not rent, want to repeat that.",125,,

1545,0.97,10392.882,10406.329,"I think all of that information from our cameras, from cameras at the scene, and from other perspectives will have to be reviewed, to make sure that we are understanding clearly what happened.",125,,
1546,0.97,10406.329,10415.004,"Again if anything happened that is outside either our policy of 1400 or the Seattle municipal code, we will make sure that is followed up on.",125,,

1549,0.97,10426.616,10438.427,"And, the thing that stood out to me, as I did see Video, because no one is Disputing, that there is a Video last night of folks throwing things at the police line.",126,,
1550,0.97,10438.427,10446.636,"That is something, that I don't abide by, and I hate to see, and, I don't like violence against anybody, including, our uniformed officers.",126,,

1554,0.97,10470.626,10477.967,"I guess my concern, is that, even with that, there is still a little bit of the primitive Teargas, last night.",126,,
1555,0.97,10477.967,10485.875,"And, I just want to make sure that we are exhausting all of the efforts that we can as a Department, to effectively De- escalate these situations.",126,,

1561,0.97,10522.211,10531.621,"I think we need your incident commanders giving direction to officers on the street, and what, if feasible means, and, what kind of, injury they need to protect themselves and others from.",127,,

1564,0.97,10538.728,10570.559,"I have never, in 25 years of personally protesting in the city of Seattle experienced such an indiscriminate use of Teargas, pepper spray, and flash bombs, against people who are not doing anything wrong, with so little effort, to De- escalate, to negotiate with protesters, to utilize Peacekeepers were willing to help you, and, and really, to focus your efforts on the people who are doing wrong.",127,,

1579,0.97,10749.939,10758.814,"And to say that some white men or some people are looking to start a fight, as you and the Mayor have repeatedly done, I am not Cherry picking one quote from you.",133,,

1583,0.97,10800.022,10823.312,"Do you need a rule to tell you that your officer should not grab a Demonstrator, all the Demonstrator is doing, and thank you for showing that, is, Animatedly speaking out, so do you need a row?",133,,

1591,0.97,10855.644,10861.417,"My second question is, what is the consequence, if the OPA roles that something is not considered a right?",133,,
1592,0.97,10861.417,10876.765,"I appreciate the questions from Councilmember Lewis, but to me, was to haul it highlight why the process is going to be, and we need a community led investigation, because what if something is not ruled a right?",133,,
1593,0.97,10876.765,10881.971,Is going to be whatever violence was used was just by?,133,,

1797,0.97,12646.734,12655.109,"I am taking in all of the comments here, Council members, you are raising great questions that need to be answered.",156,,
1798,0.97,12655.109,12660.347,"I'm taking note, like Andrew and my staff, it is all hands on deck as well.",156,,
1799,0.97,12660.347,12666.253,"Trying to get our hands around what a review of this situation looks like, moving forward.",156,,
1800,0.97,12666.253,12675.062,"So, just briefly, Oig is providing oversight of both the Seattle police to permit and be office of police accountability.",156,,
1801,0.97,12675.062,12684.638,"Under has mentioned he is taking in excess of 12,000 complaints read my office has also been a Conduit for complaints, and we are taking those in.",156,,
1802,0.97,12684.638,12693.48,The individual allegations to director Myerberg and handling those that are dealing with systemic issues in my office.,156,,
1803,0.97,12693.48,12707.094,"So in addition to that, we also review and certify every OPA investigation, so we'll have a role in quality assurance with Andrew Myerberg's investigation as well.",156,,
1804,0.97,12707.094,12716.47,"So, you know, this moment is a moment that must be seized, and recognized as a powder, a power catalyst for systemic change.",156,,
1805,0.97,12716.47,12726.747,"It's building on this moment, Oig is commencing to create a review of the response to these mass demonstrations, to identify areas for system improvement.",156,,
1806,0.97,12726.747,12741.995,"So as we envision review, we seek to find the systemic route of problems with the goal of not repeating those mistakes in the future.",156,,
1807,0.97,12741.995,12751.538,"And it seems, as much effort has gone into it in the past, these things seem to be happening again, so there has got to be a way to go at it and make this change happen.",156,,
1808,0.97,12751.538,12766.019,"It is clear to me that any kind of review must begin with the community centered process to incorporate community concerns, questions, and it's got to inform the work that Oig does in this regard.",156,,
1809,0.97,12766.019,12772.626,"Hearing the voice of community is both an ongoing charge in my office, and an ongoing challenge.",156,,
1810,0.97,12772.626,12774.962,Community must be involved to make this work.,156,,
1811,0.97,12774.962,12778.432,"To be relevant, to be a sponsor, and to be Impactful.",156,,
1812,0.97,12778.432,12796.683,"So, my office has been reaching out to CPC and OPA, and other Stakeholders, such as ACLU, to try to put together a process, that can be as inclusive to the community center, as we can make it.",156,,
1813,0.97,12796.683,12799.052,"So, change essentially is long overdue, it's coming, with or without us.",156,,
1814,0.97,12799.052,12811.165,"So, the office of the inspector general, as the accountability and responsibility for systemic oversight of SPD, and the office of police accountability, wants to be a part of that change.",156,,
1815,0.97,12811.165,12814.368,Policing is an institution and has a lot of work to do.,156,,
1816,0.97,12814.368,12820.207,And I'm committed to working alongside community and Seattle police Department to do that work here in Seattle.,156,,
1817,0.97,12820.207,12823.51,Something thank you very much.,156,,
1818,0.97,12823.51,12839.993,"We are starting to work on a process right now, it is probably going to be phased, so that we can have a community voice--that informs our work and some deep dive Audits into issues identified by the work.",156,,
1819,0.97,12839.993,12858.645,"And I would be happy to update you, as we come to a better understanding of what this process looks like, and I would love any input suggestions, Critiques, that anyone might have that would help develop how we inform the process.",156,,

1830,0.97,12904.157,12914.868,"They have expressed grief, outrage, asked tough questions about police accountability--I've read all these Emails, personally.",161,,
1831,0.97,12914.868,12916.97,I want to make sure that their questions are answered.,161,,
1832,0.97,12916.97,12924.511,"I also want to thank Council President Gonzalez, and chair Herbold for happening today.",161,,
1833,0.97,12924.511,12933.387,"And for police accountability leaders for being here, and the panelists, who were giving their eye when it comes to us.",161,,
1834,0.97,12933.387,12943.13,And I want to say that I just want--it's important for me to say that black lives matter.,161,,
1835,0.97,12943.13,12948.835,"And coming from a privileged white man, I realize this can ring hollow, and people want actions, not just words.",161,,
1836,0.97,12948.835,12960.447,"I join, joined the peaceful March this weekend, to decry the wrongful killing of George Floyd, and the history of institutional racism.",161,,
1837,0.97,12960.447,12974.428,"Monday night, after city council meeting, I observed for several hours the restraint exercised by Seattle police officers from the North Precinct, who kept things as peaceful as possible, with another protest in northeast Seattle.",161,,
1838,0.97,12974.428,12980.734,"Now I want to thank the police officers for that, for their professionalism.",161,,
1839,0.97,12980.734,12988.442,"I also, however, watched these deeply disturbing Video Footages of the response from some officers to the protesters downtown.",161,,
1840,0.97,12988.442,12990.677,Councilmember Lewis shared one of those.,161,,
1841,0.97,12990.677,12995.148,Councilmember Sawant shared some disturbing photos.,161,,
1842,0.97,12995.148,12996.984,And that is why we are here today.,161,,
1843,0.97,12996.984,13001.788,My colleagues have already asked most of the questions I have received from my constituents.,161,,
1844,0.97,13001.788,13030.917,"This civilian led office police Accout ability has already acknowledged in a formal statement today, they are looking into several of these disturbing issues, why the badges were covered, Widebody cameras were turned off or capped off my wife police rifles were stolen, why crowds were dispersed by officers by some officers using disturbing topics that made things worse.",161,,
1845,0.97,13030.917,13040.627,They range from people who highly value our professional police officers to those who have had negative expenses with the police departments.,161,,
1846,0.97,13040.627,13072.325,"But they all want to know whether this system we have of police accountability, the community police Commissioner and office of Inspector general, the office of lease account ability, can really make sure that any officers engaged in misconduct, including use of force, can remain in place for longer, whether the new labor contract with our police officers will finally incorporate additional police reforms.",161,,
1847,0.97,13072.325,13100.187,"And whether city members sitting here today will thoroughly examine how we allocate our budget to ensure we do no further harm . I do want to follow up on an issue on the badges . The chief discussed briefly, but I'm hoping that she implements this, immediately, where the dark tape to warn other officers is affixed in a manner that does not cover up their name and badge number, I think that is really important.",161,,
1848,0.97,13100.187,13107.06,"I am concerned about the Curfew that is been extended all the way to June 6th, I believe.",161,,
1849,0.97,13107.06,13109.729,I am hoping the Council considers discussing that further.,161,,
1850,0.97,13109.729,13138.024,"I also will submit more questions to German Herbold about how many people were injured, about how many arrests were made, other people in jail right now who did not physically harm other persons, I will send these on to German Herbold.",161,,
1851,0.97,13138.024,13143.73,"Thank you Councilmember Gonzales,, president Gonzales.",162,,
1852,0.97,13143.73,13155.642,"Thank you, I appreciate the opportunity to address my colleagues and the accountability partners.",163,,
1853,0.97,13155.642,13168.221,"I of course Unfortunately was unable to ask my questions of the chief, who was here before hand, and hoped to be able to.",163,,
1854,0.97,13168.221,13172.259,To send those questions along related to many of these issues.,163,,
1855,0.97,13172.259,13177.631,So I hope to be able to get clear responses to many of the questions that I have.,163,,
1856,0.97,13177.631,13207.06,"I too wanted to thank our accountability partners for being such good partners to me for the past four years, as we have endeavored to really dig into these issues, and to work, Collaboratively, on the issue that we have a system the community can trust when there are incidences that need to be investigated, and certainly there are many in this case that need to be investigated, and they recognize it is a test of the system.",163,,
1857,0.97,13207.06,13219.072,I wanted to just really quickly address some of the issues around the consent agree and work we have left to do.,163,,
1858,0.97,13219.072,13234.421,"This morning I had the opportunity to talk to the Seattle times and indicated my support for withdrawal of the motion of, of the consent to Pre-Motion that was filed by city attorneys office.",163,,
1859,0.97,13234.421,13278.898,"I continue to believe that, in the last couple of weeks, we have certainly received a lot more information that is relevant to the issues related to where we are at, in terms of our progress with the consent to create and we have many new sets of facts now that are relevant to the question, so that discussion, and I think the last five days have shown us that as a relates to our use of force policies, we may not be ready to go it alone without the court supervision, and without the ongoing assessment of how we are putting into practice our use of force policies.",163,,
1860,0.97,13278.898,13357.777,"So, I'm going to continue to support the efforts around making sure that happens, and I understand that there will be an announcement shortly about the motion to have the consent terminated, and looking forward to hearing that announcement here shortly, so I just want to encourage my colleagues to be open to how the decree plays into these broader accountability issues, of course . I think director Myerberg put it very well, the stress in issues and trust that are at play here, similarly a consent decree is not going to save our community, you know, sort of bureaucratic, technical legal case is not what is going to help with healing and unity, and with preventing the wrongful killing of black Americans in our community and across the country.",163,,
1861,0.97,13357.777,13367.454,And so I really wanted to acknowledge that I appreciate your ongoing efforts in this process.,163,,
1862,0.97,13367.454,13374.961,And I wanted to have an opportunity broadly to just ask the Commissioner a question about the system.,163,,
1863,0.97,13374.961,13379.866,"We had an opportunity, and this was Predated.",163,,
1864,0.97,13379.866,13397.984,"So when I say we I mean the institution . We had an opportunity in 2017 to work on the police accountability ordinance that you have identified where around that adversity, anniversary here today.",163,,
1865,0.97,13397.984,13414.2,"I want to just ask you pointedly, whether the community police Commission has changed its position or thinking around the structure of the accountability system, as it currently exists.",163,,
1866,0.97,13414.2,13428.214,We have heard some folks suggest that we need to radically modify the police system.,163,,
1867,0.97,13428.214,13456.843,"And we hear others say we need the accountability system as it was designed in the 2017 ordinance, so I want to be able to give you an opportunity, from the community police Commission to give us a better sense of how the CPC is thinking about those Spectrums, as it relates to the structure of our existing police system.",163,,
1868,0.97,13456.843,13461.948,In light of recent events.,163,,
1869,0.97,13461.948,13466.152,Thank you very much for the question and giving me an opportunity.,164,,
1870,0.97,13466.152,13469.556,I do not believe the position has changed.,164,,
1871,0.97,13469.556,13480.834,I think that one of the clear difficulties for us all is that the promise of the 2017 account ability legislation has never really been realized.,164,,
1872,0.97,13480.834,13501.12,"But there is a structure within the legislation, which Compiles for various kinds of Flexibilities, in ways we can achieve community responsive accountability, and that we can do that within the structure of ordinance.",164,,
1873,0.97,13501.12,13514.601,"But at this moment in time, you know I think the place we have been and where we have been consistently, is that we want to realize the actual promise of the 2017, and we have not been able to do that yet.",164,,
1874,0.97,13514.601,13522.609,So from our perspective,164,,
1875,0.97,13522.609,13529.582,"I appreciate that, because I do that, he think that is important to hear.",165,,
1876,0.97,13529.582,13548.635,"I think there have been suggestions that we abandoned, the structure that was recommended and endorsed by the community police Commission, and the community driven process, the informed the ideals that we memorialized in the police accountability ordinance in 2017.",165,,
1877,0.97,13548.635,13565.251,"And so it's really important for I think me, the public, and my colleagues to hear that the community police Commission has not shifted on how it's currently structured from a structural perspective, right?",165,,
1878,0.97,13565.251,13593.146,"And then I think what is really important to me is also acknowledge that the police contract did you know, not Memorialize everything we envisioned in the 27 police 2017 police accountability ordinance.",165,,
1879,0.97,13593.146,13686.639,"Now, as we look forward to strengthen our processes around how we make sure that the numbers of the city Council, who art representatives of labor relations policy hear from community, either from community police Commission with the police Commission and in tandem with the CPC, to make sure that we understand fundamentally what our charge is . When we go into the labor relations policy committee meetings, and what and how we can lift up some of those issues, and I'm going to make some comments about how we are reshaping our process, but I want to again give you, Commissioner, an opportunity to talk about or the opportunities may be as a relates to that coordination of work as we, as the city council begin to think in structure, our internal processes to achieve what was promised in the 2017 police accountability ordinance, which I still remain committed to trying to achieve through these collective bargaining ordinance.",165,,
1880,0.97,13686.639,13688.241,Thank you for that question.,166,,
1881,0.97,13688.241,13700.086,"I think from our perspective, yes, the accountability structure within the ordinance is a structure that can be utilized in order to achieve sustainable change.",166,,
1882,0.97,13700.086,13707.093,And I think that is one of the things that is important about the accountability system that has been laid out.,166,,
1883,0.97,13707.093,13717.57,"It can result in sustainable policy change, but then the structures that we are considering and examining, and many of which we have talked about today.",166,,
1884,0.97,13717.57,13725.211,"With respect to, with respect to bargaining, I very much appreciate the design to have the CPC involved.",166,,
1885,0.97,13725.211,13734.654,"It is our desire also, we have Invoiced for the CP C to be involved.",166,,
1886,0.97,13734.654,13746.332,"I know there are thoughts about the various ways in which CPC can do so, and we certainly have various different ideas about what makes sense.",166,,
1887,0.97,13746.332,13755.441,"From our perspective, of course, we want someone who is well versed with police accountability.",166,,
1888,0.97,13755.441,13759.846,Well versed within a history of policing in Seattle.,166,,
1889,0.97,13759.846,13766.018,Well versed with labor issues.,166,,
1890,0.97,13766.018,13784.47,"We would like someone who is technically savvy, who can represent all of those points of view and do that in Fidelity to a community and the voices of community, to those that have been raised here for many years now, but certainly those that have been raised in the last several days.",166,,
1891,0.97,13784.47,13825.311,"And if a person like that is someone the Council admits into the process, then we can still maintain, meet the process of the 2017 accountability participation, when we are talking about the bargaining process, and when we are talking about those discrepancies between the contracts . I would say from the CPC's perspective, those are our desires with the person who would be involved in playing that role for you, and hopefully in assistance to you all, so that we can achieve the best possible outcomes here.",166,,
1892,0.97,13825.311,13853.139,"I appreciate that, and again, you know when, when the chair asked me to, I will sort of describe what next steps are going to be, in that regard, that have been informed by all my conversations with the Commissioner, and the other accountability partners that wanted to again, have an opportunity to address that as part of the panel.",167,,
1893,0.97,13853.139,13861.847,"I just have a few more questions for the other panelists, if I might, chair Herbold?",167,,
1894,0.97,13861.847,13876.662,"Okay, so this one is for Inspector General judge, you know, I know you were listening to the community panel and I appreciate you listening and taking notes.",167,,
1895,0.97,13876.662,13897.216,"And I'm sure you heard something that I heard, which was that some community members believe that, that black organized, or Black-Led protests are treated tactically . technically treated differently by the Seattle police Department than regular organized protest.",167,,
1896,0.97,13897.216,13929.115,"So I was wondering, whether as part of your annual work plan, which, you know you take into consideration at the end of the previous year, and, and, but I know it's an interim process, whether it's an opportunity to frame and audit and evaluate the tactics that have historically been utilized in black organized versus Non- black organized protests.",167,,
1897,0.97,13929.115,13952.838,"Yes thank you for that question or it . This issue has come up in complaints to our office from other people, but it's been in the context of political spectrum, that there is a differential disparity in treatment of protests in left organized protests versus right wing organized protests.",168,,
1898,0.97,13952.838,13965.518,And that may very well be written into our work plan as a near horizon project to look at mass demonstration response for disparity.,168,,
1899,0.97,13965.518,13978.064,"And so my, I fully intend to work that into this particular project, that there is no reason to put it off when clearly it's an issue here.",168,,
1900,0.97,13978.064,13978.664,That's great.,169,,
1901,0.97,13978.664,14009.895,"I mean, I think it's really important, and I know that there's the political spectrum question, which is sort of, what is the subject matter of the first amendment, and I think my question is, I think the nuance being raised is just slightly different, which is, I suppose that the subject of black lives matter protests could be construed as political spectrum.",169,,
1902,0.97,14009.895,14043.129,"But, but really it's sort of that the difference between you, who is organizing it, and so, I just, I just think it's really important for us to listen to that, that concern, that when it is a Non-Black organized or led protest, that somehow that that, that the tactics in the field being used are fundamentally different than in different circumstances.",169,,
1903,0.97,14043.129,14043.496,Absolutely.,170,,
1904,0.97,14043.496,14044.497,I hear that.,170,,
1905,0.97,14044.497,14060.813,"It had come up in that other context, but clearly the context of race and financial, and separate treatment based on race and particularly Lac- organized protests, will be a focus of any analysis that we do.",170,,
1906,0.97,14060.813,14061.747,Great.,171,,
1907,0.97,14061.747,14074.126,"And in terms, and I think this is a question for any of the panelists, but in particular for you, Inspector General judge, and any of the other experts.",171,,
1908,0.97,14074.126,14104.99,"I'm not asking you to pine on the usage of these devices in these specific, you know, instances of these cases and complaints peered but, from a best Disses perspective, my understanding is that Teargas for example, has been banned by the convention as a tool that is used for dispersal.",171,,
1909,0.97,14104.99,14124.91,"And of course this came to a head, when we saw the Trump administration was using Teargas at the Southern U.S./Mexico border, on immigrants and refugees who were seeking asylum in our port.",171,,
1910,0.97,14124.91,14155.14,"So, is, as it relates to American policing, where do we stand, in terms of the use of Teargas in crowd management practices? and, do any of you have an opinion now, as to the appropriateness of using Teargas ever for purposes of crowd management?",171,,
1911,0.97,14155.14,14161.247,Yeah can I just make sure that I am very clear in my understanding of the question.,172,,
1912,0.97,14161.247,14171.056,Are you differentiating Teargas or cs gas and OC spray?,172,,
1913,0.97,14171.056,14171.423,I am.,173,,
1914,0.97,14171.423,14172.658,I am not referring --,173,,
1915,0.97,14172.658,14173.058,Okay great.,174,,
1916,0.97,14173.058,14173.659,Okay great.,174,,
1917,0.97,14173.659,14177.563,I am specifically referring to what is Colloquially referred to as Teargas.,175,,
1918,0.97,14177.563,14187.273,I just want to make sure I understand the question clearly.,176,,
1919,0.97,14187.273,14202.588,"That was not a agent used, and I think it speaks to broader tactics at all, in crowds where there are largely peaceful protests, and when I say peaceful protest, that does not mean there is anger or not shouting.",177,,
1920,0.97,14202.588,14208.994,It means there is not sorts of criminal activity going on.,177,,
1921,0.97,14208.994,14211.463,But I don't want to go into that.,177,,
1922,0.97,14211.463,14249.602,"I think in my expense, and I have experience with protests that turned into right situations, that we finally came to an understanding that putting officers out there, who are specially trained in the communities that they are going to be engaging with in, ineffective communication with those, those folks that are out there protesting.",177,,
1923,0.97,14249.602,14275.294,"And people who protecting, with putting them out there into forms that looked even sometimes like normal clothing, Polo shirts or things that weren't Militaristic and that to the extent you put officers out in a situation that invites confrontation, what you tend to get his confrontation.",177,,
1924,0.97,14275.294,14294.546,"So, I think all of these questions about munitions are effective, whether even appropriate tactics, all of that would be things that I would want to look at and that are legitimate questions the community should have answers to.",177,,
1925,0.97,14294.546,14330.883,"And I do think it's important for us from a Foundational question to look at all of the tactics being used here, but in her tutor, the chemical weapons that are being deployed it and I think it's important for us to look at that in the context of the International human rights Commission, community, has stated, which is that chemical weapons, like Teargas, should absolutely not be used.",178,,
1926,0.97,14330.883,14356.041,"And so, I am concerned that we are deviating from those human rights conditions, and that we need to terminate the use of those types of agents and I would look to you all as subject matter experts in helping us shepherd through policy that would allow for that to occur.",178,,
1927,0.97,14356.041,14366.919,I would be happy to get my staff in getting some technical assistance for you in the immediate term.,179,,
1928,0.97,14366.919,14371.457,"That, I would think, would be extremely useful and help you, helpful.",180,,
1929,0.97,14371.457,14388.774,"We did hear the chief seemingly state that she wanted to hear what ideas without would-be alternatives, and so this would be a good opportunity for us to provide her with those alternatives to see if she does more.",180,,
1930,0.97,14388.774,14393.278,I also want to take a moment to go back on one of the community Presenters.,181,,
1931,0.97,14393.278,14396.482,And I think it was maybe Mr.,181,,
1932,0.97,14396.482,14411.697,"Davis, who talked about notice, giving the crowd notice and warning and an opportunity to understand what is happening, and to potentially make other choices, if that's appropriate.",181,,
1933,0.97,14411.697,14417.503,I think that's also going to be a large issue here in moving forward.,181,,
1934,0.97,14417.503,14431.65,"That seems like a very easy thing for SPD to rectify to ensure there is appropriate notice being given before deployment of any kind of munitions, and opportunity for folks to get out of there or to protect themselves.",181,,
1935,0.97,14431.65,14433.685,And just one last question.,182,,
1936,0.97,14433.685,14434.987,Sure.,183,,
1937,0.97,14434.987,14438.323,"We are, Visa, dealing with this in real time.",184,,
1938,0.97,14438.323,14463.115,And many of us in this Committee hearing are seeing videos and reports of highly concerning things and questions about whether the force is proportional to what is actually operating in field.,184,,
1939,0.97,14463.115,14488.273,"Is there anything in the system that needs to be or should be changed, now, immediately, to allow for either you, Inspector General judge, or you, director Myerberg, or the community police Commission, to be able to effectively, in real time, say Xyz tactic must end and it must and now, for the following reasons --",184,,
1940,0.97,14488.273,14497.95,"I think both director Myerberg's office has recommendations to issue, but their recommendations.",185,,
1941,0.97,14497.95,14552.738,"I don't know that we have the ordinance, as well intended and Well-Crafted as it is, doesn't give us necessity in certain areas, this being one of those, we could certainly convene, a group based on, I think we have all the information we need right now, having a number of these sessions observed on my own, operations, and that the collective understanding of the situation right now, I think that the partners could certainly convene and work to come up with some immediate recommendations in community around counsel, that is just one thing I think is on the table, right now I would be interested in what my partners have to say about that.",185,,
1942,0.97,14552.738,14553.705,I would concur.,186,,
1943,0.97,14553.705,14568.186,"I think we can work together, the jurisdiction is more omitted and we are focused on individual incidents and not the overall systemic policies and practices of the departments.",186,,
1944,0.97,14568.186,14590.475,"That being said, we do have the ability to issue what are called management action recommendations, which are policy recommendations, as a general matter, they occur over full investigation, but I don't think there is anything that would prevent us from working together, with that systemic review, we are working together with partners to develop immediate recommendations.",186,,
1945,0.97,14590.475,14592.044,I concur.,187,,
1946,0.97,14592.044,14612.297,"We have received during our meeting, received a great deal of public comment, as well, that we will be working on Distilling down as well, so I concur . I think we would be happy to work with our partners in order to issue agency, especially based on what we received.",187,,
1947,0.97,14612.297,14618.303,Yeah and --,188,,
1948,0.97,14618.303,14619.938,The real-time nature of recommendations is important.,189,,
1949,0.97,14619.938,14622.608,And I think that is what I'm getting at.,189,,
1950,0.97,14622.608,14665.65,"I think it's important, sort of, you know, in real time, you know, based on the last four days, how do we, how do we prop up our accountability system partners to be nimble and move fast, in terms of being able to say look the last five days of things that we have seen lead us to say that these types of practices, these should no longer be deployed in the field, or there will be a risk of you know, significant consequence to the city, right?",189,,
1951,0.97,14665.65,14674.359,"And so I am hoping there will be an opportunity for you all to be that nimble and flexible, and again it's not passing judgment on specific incidents.",189,,
1952,0.97,14674.359,14694.546,"It is the feeling what I think is the beautiful promise of this accountability system, which is being able to fast and nimble enough to, to express from your independent perspectives, when there are significant concerns, and they are going down the wrong path.",189,,
1953,0.97,14694.546,14720.505,"When SPD is going down the wrong path it's my expectation and my desire, that each of you feel like you are empowered and independent enough, and strong enough to be able to use your voices to throw up the flag and say, this is not correct and needs to cease.",189,,
1954,0.97,14720.505,14722.441,And that does not mean that you are Prejudging things.,189,,
1955,0.97,14722.441,14726.411,It means you are anticipating that things could get worse.,189,,
1956,0.97,14726.411,14731.783,And we need you all in our accountability system to help us with that exercise as a subject matter.,189,,
1957,0.97,14731.783,14734.886,"Yeah, I really agree, Council President.",190,,
1958,0.97,14734.886,14763.014,"That the embracing of our accountability partners that their potential to not just pass judgment and make recommendations on things that have happened in the past, but to help us as a city mitigate moving forward is really important, and we have urgency, and momentum to propel us forward in those discussions.",190,,
1959,0.97,14763.014,14780.765,"And I really think that is critical, so that we can get the confidence of the community, that we aren't just using nice words, and we expect to get a report with recommendations and put them on the shelf.",190,,
1960,0.97,14780.765,14790.642,"I know Councilmembers, Councilmember Sawant had another quick question, as did Council member Teresa Mosqueda.",190,,
1961,0.97,14790.642,14824.609,"Chair Herbold, I think they have alluded to this, was, not so much the process, so my question is how can the OPA investigation process result in sequences for the officers who inflicted violence against members of the public, given that the process uses Seattle police so to do the interviews and gather the evidence?",191,,
1962,0.97,14824.609,14828.88,"So, I will address that in a couple ways.",192,,
1963,0.97,14828.88,14837.823,"First, our investigators are a hybrid model between civilian and sworn . It's not all sworn investigators working on these cases.",192,,
1964,0.97,14837.823,14863.315,"In fact pepper spray cases assigned to our investigator, so, we, even that being said we are sworn investigators all reporting to civilians, as you know I have a civilian deputy director investigations, another civilian intermediate supervisors of investigations, all of whom have been involved in public oversight, all of whom are reviewing these cases.",192,,
1965,0.97,14863.315,14872.757,We are committed and thus one staff are committed to that civilian leadership and are committed to Uncovering evidence.,192,,
1966,0.97,14872.757,14887.472,"We are working with the community to pull whatever Video we can find . There is no evidence too high, there is nothing too high, if that was the application.",192,,
1967,0.97,14887.472,14888.607,All our information is transparent.,192,,
1968,0.97,14888.607,14896.481,Every single document we can produce can be reproduced publicly.,192,,
1969,0.97,14896.481,14907.659,"So I believe in the stuff that works at OPA, whether civilian or sworn, and that was a model created by city Council and others to create a hybrid model working together.",192,,
1970,0.97,14907.659,14912.063,"And just like the CPC commissioners, both civilian and sworn, it works okay too.",192,,
1971,0.97,14912.063,14926.611,"I strongly believe we will be able to uncover Evidenc, and that the investigators will do their best to make sure where things went wrong, we identify those and call them out.",192,,
1972,0.97,14926.611,14936.388,"I know I said, Councilmember Strauss made me as I skipped over him, I'm so sorry.",193,,
1973,0.97,14936.388,14941.192,Going to turn over to some of her stress.,193,,
1974,0.97,14941.192,14942.127,Thank you for your patience.,193,,
1975,0.97,14942.127,14972.757,"I want to first announce to folks, for anybody who is viewing the city attorney has announced that he is withdrawing the motion to dismiss the filing on the consent to three, so that is sort of breaking news, that is very timely and consistent with public expectations, given they are a new set of circumstances to consider as it relates to many of the issues Preaddressed.",193,,
1976,0.97,14972.757,14973.358,Counsel number stress.,193,,
1977,0.97,14973.358,15000.986,"Thank you, chair Herbold, and think you to OPA, thank you, there is so much more work for us to do to ensure accountability is created for our police officers, and I will be direct without present already part of our governments, I would be so lost, and I would be very upset with where we are today.",194,,
1978,0.97,15000.986,15005.056,"I am reassured by your presence, and I know there is more to do.",194,,
1979,0.97,15005.056,15009.894,My question is for the second panel that came before you.,194,,
1980,0.97,15009.894,15016.568,"I am going to read them into the record for them to be reflected on the record, and my questions will be Emailed to the Mayor and the chief.",194,,
1981,0.97,15016.568,15034.719,"And so, my questions really are understanding why and how we have put this Curfew in place beyond the weekend, what purpose does it serve, and how effective has it been?",194,,
1982,0.97,15034.719,15041.393,"A question, Subquestion to that is what Metrics need to be obtained for the Curfew to be removed?",194,,
1983,0.97,15041.393,15050.835,"I agree with the chief that we cannot allow for acts of aggression to be made public or officers, no one should be on the receiving end's of rocks, bottles, or Feces.",194,,
1984,0.97,15050.835,15058.109,"And with that understanding, it is clear to me from the last two days, the military grade weapons are not a partial response to rocks, bottles, or Feces.",194,,
1985,0.97,15058.109,15073.158,"Military grade weapons do not assist in De-Escalation, and so my questions are directly, can you ensure to the deputy Mayor and to the chief, can you ensure your gas and flash bang grenades will not be used?",194,,
1986,0.97,15073.158,15079.164,What needs to occur to ensure the use of tear gas and a flash bang grenades ends?,194,,
1987,0.97,15079.164,15085.804,"We saw six foot base, De- escalating between Monday and Tuesday.",194,,
1988,0.97,15085.804,15090.675,What additional steps were taken for today and the remainder of the week to continue De- escalation?,194,,
1989,0.97,15090.675,15106.791,"And I agree with the chief about social media, I am asking her to join her and her officers this evening so I may have an unfiltered experience, and I am asking what time and place should I join?",194,,
1990,0.97,15106.791,15117.969,"Those are my questions, and I will be very clear at the end of this, we cannot continue to use military grade weapons against the residence back of our community, and it does not De-Escalate what is currently an escalated situation.",194,,
1991,0.97,15117.969,15127.912,We must stop using tear gas and flash bang's immediately.,194,,
1992,0.97,15127.912,15134.419,"This Curfew should be lifted today, the Curfew, the use of tear gas and the use of flash bang grenades are unnecessarily escalating tensions in our city.",194,,
1993,0.97,15134.419,15136.788,Also left my phone number for contacting me.,194,,
1994,0.97,15136.788,15144.229,So I just wanted to take that moment for the record to flex.,194,,
1995,0.97,15144.229,15145.63,Thank you for letting me have time.,194,,
1996,0.97,15145.63,15147.232,Thank you counsel number stress.,195,,
1997,0.97,15147.232,15148.199,Really good questions.,195,,
1998,0.97,15148.199,15153.738,Great expectations that I share.,195,,
1999,0.97,15153.738,15158.643,Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda.,195,,
2000,0.97,15158.643,15160.245,"Thank you, Madam chair.",196,,
2001,0.97,15160.245,15179.464,"I first want to say thank you to believe it was director Myerberg, you posted clarification about the officer who had, folks assumed he was the one who had tear gassed the child, and I know there was some verification there it was not that officer, thanks for posting the clarification.",196,,
2002,0.97,15179.464,15188.673,"I thought, I wonder what would have helped us identify the right officer, probably the badge number.",196,,
2003,0.97,15188.673,15199.25,"And so I think that is just a great example of where we need those badge numbers showing now . I understand as of this afternoon, those badge numbers are still not being shown.",196,,
2004,0.97,15199.25,15204.689,So I appreciate the clarification on who is going to be held accountable for that action will be directed to the right officer.,196,,
2005,0.97,15204.689,15207.792,But I think we still have a problem with badge numbers not being shown.,196,,
2006,0.97,15207.792,15238.289,"And I want to put it out for you to comment on, getting clarification or issuing recommendations on getting those badge numbers shown, Asap, even though thank you Adam chair, has been working how to push the mayors and executive PD to show badge numbers and use other strategies, we still have badge numbers that are not being shown tonight, and yesterday the Mayor's comment was it is not going to happen overnight but when quite literally I think tape can be removed overnight.",196,,
2007,0.97,15238.289,15246.464,So looking forward to hearing the recommendations for how to show they can be shown overnight.,196,,
2008,0.97,15246.464,15256.107,I want to build off of the question that I believe was just asked by one of my colleagues a moment ago.,196,,
2009,0.97,15256.107,15268.152,"We I have officers listed in other cities who have been reprimanded already for a reprehensible behavior, that includes ft.",196,,
2010,0.97,15268.152,15289.04,"Lauderdale Florida, Denver, Colorado, Atlanta, Georgia, or officers have already been suspended or fired because of actions taken on camera were recorded on camera, and I appreciate the robust process we have built into the legislation and due diligence to go through the analysis given the number of complaints we have received.",196,,
2011,0.97,15289.04,15335.119,"I'm wondering if there's anything we can do anymore expedited fashion, especially for some of the more egregious complaints that were caught on camera to do the investigation, and or to issue recommendation thickly so that there is accountability for those actions, and Madam chair, my last question builds off the question the Council President asked last in her line of inquiry, I am asking you to, I am asking you, today, issue guidance or your recommendation for stopping the use of tear gas, flash bangs, and rubber bullets.",196,,
2012,0.97,15335.119,15341.225,"At a bare minimum, these are the three things I ask of the chief before she had to leave, the deputy was on the line and did not answer.",196,,
2013,0.97,15341.225,15384.869,"I know that we have a situation, where sometimes there are individuals we might need to isolate because of potentially, you know, dangerous or violent behavior that has been Referenced by the chief, there are strategies, De- escalation strategies that we have asked for the officers to deploy that includes isolating individuals who may be problematic and when we heard the response for Monday and Tuesday's flash bang's, rubber bullets, and tear gas being used because there was ""a few individuals, or when individual in the crowd, who is Potentialy starting a fight or rushing forward ."" they need to isolate the individual, not used tear gas, rubber bullets, and flash bangs on the entire crowd.",196,,
2014,0.97,15384.869,15385.737,We have seen it twice.,196,,
2015,0.97,15385.737,15401.753,"I would also say the Department of these weapons of war, were used on Saturday night as well, and I think that it is disputable, whether or not that, I think that they were not warranted.",196,,
2016,0.97,15401.753,15429.18,"I think there were definitely situations that were dangerous, including broken windows and cars on fire, but the stories we heard repeatedly were people who were really just trying to get downtown to express their support for the black lives matter movement, and mourning all the individuals who have been killed and experts excessive violence at the hands of police, and they were not able to get downtown either.",196,,
2017,0.97,15429.18,15450.635,"I think not just singling out Monday and Tuesday's actions, but I would like you on this third question to tell us, immediately, as the Council President was urging, and I don't want to put words in the Presidents mouth, if there could be recommendation to stop using flash bangs, tear gas, and rubber bullets.",196,,
2018,0.97,15450.635,15452.503,"Thank you, those are my questions.",196,,
2019,0.97,15452.503,15467.552,"And before you answer that, I do want to flag again, that we do have a recommendation from 2015 and 2016 from the CPC for these discontinuation of the use of flash balls.",197,,
2020,0.97,15467.552,15474.058,So it is really important to recognize and honor the work that has been done before.,197,,
2021,0.97,15474.058,15563.948,"I definitely want to hear from the OPA and Oig on their thoughts, but I think it is really important to honor the work that our CPC has done on two different occasions, because of two different incidences, and so I don't want to continue a pattern of not acting on the recommendations, also, before we get into the bit about the morning, I do want to flag that I have seen photos of today wearing a morning band over her badge number, and I am very very disappointed, because I leave she can show leadership by simply moving the location of that band . I understand the police policy says it needs to be in the center . I am going to, I am working on legislation, right now to Mary the tradition of mourning bands with our existing lot about the prohibition on covering names to extend that prohibition to cover badge numbers, but to allow for the continuation of the placement of mourning bands on badges, but just in a way that does not cover badge numbers.",197,,
2022,0.97,15563.948,15570.955,"So I will leave that there, thank you.",197,,
2023,0.97,15570.955,15571.956,So at this time --,198,,
2024,0.97,15571.956,15573.224,Council member?,199,,
2025,0.97,15573.224,15585.569,"I see you have a question, I am going to let our accountability partners respond to Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda's questions first.",199,,
2026,0.97,15585.569,15602.987,"Your regard to the jurisdictions that have taken immediate action and why that is not done here, so, I just want to be clear that, and I think you will understand this, from OPA's perspective, we can recommended discipline after a full investigation.",200,,
2027,0.97,15602.987,15609.026,"We have no authorities, statutory or otherwise to put any officer on leave.",200,,
2028,0.97,15609.026,15631.916,"The chief does has the right to do so, where she can put officers on paid leave, or she can, in the interest of justice, take out their disciplinary action, but we, with regards to the timing, and I think I have said this before in my initial comments.",200,,
2029,0.97,15631.916,15639.223,"We are trying to move forward with these investigations, with all due haste.",200,,
2030,0.97,15639.223,15645.129,"I do not want to, obviously I want them to be thorough, but we are hearing, loud and clear, but we cannot wait six months for these to resolve.",200,,
2031,0.97,15645.129,15650.234,Again that is why we are trying to Reallocate resources to allow us to do the investigations in a timely fashion.,200,,
2032,0.97,15650.234,15658.509,"But we have been indicating with community members, saying why can't you do it in 15 days?",200,,
2033,0.97,15658.509,15673.324,"We are trying to give them reasons why, and it cannot satisfy all people, and we can understand that, and we are doing our best to move forward while understanding due process, because we are trying to balance both of these things together.",200,,

2040,0.97,15701.986,15734.618,"Is that a request we can put in to the chief's office, that she would then have in front of her to respond to, so that those officers, who are potentially kneeling on people, punching people, spring children in the face with tear gas, elderly or disabled people, as we saw on camera that those folks who have done that, and if you know who they are and are doing an investigation, can those individuals be requested to remain off of the front line while your investigation continues?",203,,
2041,0.97,15734.618,15745.729,"It is certainly a request that can be made of the chief, and the chief has the authority to take action, if she so chooses, but it is solely at the scratching of the chief of police.",204,,
2042,0.97,15745.729,15750.234,And it is not within OPA's authority to request the chief considering that?,205,,

2063,0.97,15948.799,15965.215,"And what is our existing inventory, and I guess more importantly, for whatever equipment has been used over the last week, or how do we ensure that we don't replace it?",219,,
2064,0.97,15965.215,15982.099,"So, those might be questions for the previous panel, I am Úsure we will discuss it in the up coming budget conversations, but I am trying to understand where this gear is coming from.",219,,

I will just say that I am not going to go into all of those and rehash the history, but I will say that you know, we having new opportunity to us as it relates to issues, that the community is concerned about with regard to how the city approaches its laboring negotiations with unions, and I am looking forward to structure conversation on the Council side that will allow us to make sure we are centering community voices in our decision-making process.",232,,

But I will share with folks, myself, Councilmember Mosqueda, Councilmember Lewis, and Councilmember Morales, we are committed to making sure we have a process in place where we are well informed, where we are community informed, and where we will make decisions with the partnership of the technical adviser to be able to make sure that we understand that we impact the choices that are before us, in that context, to make sure we are making the best choices available to us as we continue to negotiate additional portions of the police accountability ordinance into the collective agreement.",232,,

2467,0.97,19053.901,19063.811,"Yeah, I am Caleb, first I want to address I am white, so I have an obligation to uplift the voices and struggles of people of color in my community.",319,,
2468,0.97,19063.811,19071.752,"When I was marching on Sunday in Westlake, we were following the flow of police as they were directing us.",319,,
2469,0.97,19071.752,19078.659,"They boxed us in and started to throw Teargas, and flash grenades at us, when we were being Etirely peaceful.",319,,
2470,0.97,19078.659,19087.868,"I was in the CPC meeting earlier today, and the officer in the meeting stated they give three warnings over a loudspeaker before employing the tactics.",319,,
2471,0.97,19087.868,19090.538,We did not get such a warning.,319,,
2472,0.97,19090.538,19104.485,"The chief, as a career person, I find it disgusting that you would appropriate Stonewalling to, lighting for a reason and implying anyone writing now does not have a Mayor to be, a reason to be angry.",319,,
2473,0.97,19104.485,19106.187,The Mayor needs to make palpable change today!,319,,
2474,0.97,19106.187,19109.39,This Militarized officers are shameful to our community.,319,,
2475,0.97,19109.39,19114.462,The community needs to be Defunded and abolished.,319,,
2476,0.97,19114.462,19116.13,"Black lives matter, I yield my time.",319,,
2477,0.97,19116.13,19116.497,Thank you.,320,,

2479,0.97,19133.914,19150.631,"My name is BJ last, I was horrified by the Mayor and chief best seeing SPD's violent response to the peaceful protest that shows all the reform issues in the past have not worked.",321,,
2480,0.97,19150.631,19154.602,Like we cannot get the police to uncover their badges?,321,,
2481,0.97,19154.602,19163.844,"The city can enact a Curfew, but we can't get our police who are supposed to work for us to uncover their badge numbers?",321,,
2482,0.97,19163.844,19172.319,The only thing we can apparently do quickly is withdraw from E degree that did not go far enough or has not done anything.,321,,
2483,0.97,19172.319,19183.964,"I really want to, we need to Defund them now, what is happening is not working, and we need to use the money to fund Committee-Based health and safety.",321,,
2484,0.97,19183.964,19192.473,And the Mayor and chief need to resign after all the suffering they have inflicted upon their people.,321,,
2485,0.97,19192.473,19193.274,I yield my time.,321,,
2486,0.97,19193.274,19197.945,Thank you so much.,322,,

2489,0.97,19211.358,19221.402,"I was actually at the barricade that was in that Video shortly before everything, shortly before that Video began.",323,,
2490,0.97,19221.402,19240.788,"And before that happened, because I was face-to-face with a line of officers holding Batons, and in full riot gear, and looking at us with Smirks and blank faces.",323,,
2491,0.97,19240.788,19250.23,"And there is something about standing in front of a line of people who clearly do not care about your safety, seeing as an enemy, when you are completely unarmed.",323,,
2492,0.97,19250.23,19255.102,And doing nothing to start them up.,323,,
2493,0.97,19255.102,19260.107,"This is absolutely abhorrent that this is happening, and it needs to stop right now.",323,,
2494,0.97,19260.107,19261.942,"Thank you, immediately.",323,,
2495,0.97,19261.942,19263.51,Think like you for your time.,324,,

2500,0.97,19271.518,19280.761,"First of all, not only is fear being stopped, but our President is continually showing disregard for our safety.",327,,
2501,0.97,19280.761,19282.463,"Reform needs to happen, now!",327,,
2502,0.97,19282.463,19286.533,I think people are losing confidence in their government every day.,327,,
2503,0.97,19286.533,19291.438,It is clear the chief and Mayor do not care about the safety of the people.,327,,
2504,0.97,19291.438,19294.742,"She only cared about people throwing water bottles at police, which is absolutely ridiculous.",327,,
2505,0.97,19294.742,19301.348,"Many of you have spoken in support of protesters, but this is not enough.",327,,
2506,0.97,19301.348,19308.188,"Citizens are stepping out of homes onto the streets to face off against Militarized police to fight for the rights, which is what we do not need to be doing.",327,,
2507,0.97,19308.188,19310.257,That is what you were supposed to do for us.,327,,
2508,0.97,19310.257,19310.524,And yet.,327,,
2509,0.97,19310.524,19312.66,Thank you for the time I appreciate it.,327,,

2516,0.97,19327.374,19336.583,"People were just standing and actively speaking their voices, without the intent of destruction or harm.",329,,
2517,0.97,19336.583,19344.425,A water bottle is no excuse for gas and a Curfew is an active attempt to curb our free speech.,329,,
2518,0.97,19344.425,19354.201,I would like to express support for Defunding the police and also restructuring our criminal justice system to include community centered policing and justice alternatives.,329,,

2526,0.97,19387.334,19395.376,The egregious force against unarmed civilians I have witnessed is gross and appalling.,331,,
