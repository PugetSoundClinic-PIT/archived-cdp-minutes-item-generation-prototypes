30,0.97,154.187,169.135,"Because there is a public hearing associated with agenda item 1, council bill 120162, the public hearing will begin after the public comment period.",13,,

52,0.97,353.353,355.421,One second.,18,,
53,0.97,355.421,357.724,Sorry.,18,,
54,0.97,357.724,405.004,"Item one is an ordinance establishing a new 15th Avenue East business improvement area, Levying special assessments upon owners of commercial property, multifamily residential property and mixed use property within the area, providing for the deposit of revenues in a special account and providing for collection and penalties for Delinquencies, providing for the establishment of a Bia advisor board, providing for an implementation agreement with a program manager and ratifying confirming certain prior acts.",18,,
55,0.97,405.004,406.038,Open for discussion.,18,,

57,0.97,407.473,412.078,We'll open the public hearing first and then hear from the city staff.,19,,
58,0.97,412.078,422.422,"We will not be voting on this today, so keep that in mind as we proceed.",19,,
59,0.97,422.422,438.471,"As presiding officer, I'm opening the public hearing on Council bill 120162 relating to establishing a new 15th Avenue East business improvement area.",19,,
60,0.97,438.471,446.946,"I will call on speakers in the order of Online registration, which will remain open until the conclusion of the hearing.",19,,
61,0.97,446.946,452.118,The rules applied to the public comment period also apply to the public hearing.,19,,
62,0.97,452.118,457.924,Each Speaker will be provided two minutes and a Ten-Second warning to wrap up comments.,19,,

66,0.97,493.292,493.893,"Don, go ahead.",19,,
67,0.97,493.893,499.632,"Thank you and good afternoon, Councilmembers.",20,,
68,0.97,499.632,504.971,"I'm don Blakeny, just a few blocks from this proposed Bia.",20,,
69,0.97,504.971,506.439,I'm a neighbor in support.,20,,
70,0.97,506.439,511.911,"We have a Bia on Broadway that does cleaning, seems like this is a similar setup.",20,,
71,0.97,511.911,515.481,It's not as big of a street so that makes sense.,20,,
72,0.97,515.481,528.861,I would say 15th is one of our growing commercial corridors and every year has more people and businesses and activity.,20,,
73,0.97,528.861,537.169,The city doesn't usually provide the role of cleaning so I think the community coming together and property owners willing to make that investment makes a lot of sense.,20,,
74,0.97,537.169,541.574,I support this and look forward to seeing the benefits.,20,,
75,0.97,541.574,554.253,"I noticed they wanted to focus on Beautification neighborhoods as well, so it's about giving more autonomy to the neighborhood to chart its own vision is.",20,,
76,0.97,554.253,566.832,"Seems like this is a thorough and thoughtful process, so thanks for the folks putting this together and thanks for the Council for considering this today.",20,,
77,0.97,566.832,570.369,Thank you.,21,,
78,0.97,570.369,576.309,"The next Speaker, Christopher Forsythe?",21,,
79,0.97,576.309,580.746,I'm the owner of Smith restaurant on Capitol Hill.,22,,
80,0.97,580.746,585.451,I'm opposed to the business improvement area for two reasons.,22,,
81,0.97,585.451,585.818,"First, cost.",22,,
82,0.97,585.818,591.524,Revenue is down to Covid and many businesses are operating at a loss.,22,,
83,0.97,591.524,599.765,Customer conference is down because of Covid and the Variants affecting our businesses.,22,,
84,0.97,599.765,601.667,My business is down 31% versus 2019.,22,,
85,0.97,601.667,611.143,Also the cost is passed on to the property owners and they can pass it on to the business owner.,22,,
86,0.97,611.143,617.817,"The cost of the business improvement area to my business would be $1,500.",22,,
87,0.97,617.817,633.299,"I have 30 other signatures from business owners that don't feel homeland security the appropriate time to tax their businesses and don't have the financial resources such as our neighbors at Kaiser, key Bank, et cetera.",22,,
88,0.97,633.299,636.302,The second objection is with regards to process.,22,,
89,0.97,636.302,648.748,Unfortunately local business owners were not made aware of development of the Bia and had no opportunity to participate in its establishment.,22,,
90,0.97,648.748,653.886,I've never met anyone from the 15th Avenue business Association.,22,,
91,0.97,653.886,675.574,"While I might approve of the idea overall, I would suggest that at the time those with the deepest pockets fund the Bia for two years to help determine the affect effectiveness of effectiveness of the Bia on 15th Avenue.",22,,
92,0.97,675.574,681.18,"If it is successful, we could assess the situation after a two-year trial period.",22,,
93,0.97,681.18,688.621,I would be glad to be invited to participate in the process moving forward at that time.,22,,
94,0.97,688.621,697.93,This would allow the Bia to proceed in the interim without the financial burden on smaller businesses who are just trying to make ends meet.,22,,
95,0.97,697.93,698.998,Thank you for your time.,22,,
96,0.97,698.998,709.475,"Thank you very much, really appreciate hearing from you and your perspective on how this should move forward.",23,,
97,0.97,709.475,716.082,Our last Speaker that I see here is Jill Cronauer.,23,,
98,0.97,716.082,720.219,Press six to Unmute yourself.,23,,
99,0.97,720.219,720.753,Thank you.,24,,
100,0.97,720.753,725.491,This is Jill Cronauer with Hunter real estate on Capitol Hill.,24,,
101,0.97,725.491,729.462,Our focus is usually on preservation of historic buildings.,24,,
102,0.97,729.462,741.407,You should recognize some of our buildings with tenants like blue DOT.,24,,
103,0.97,741.407,747.88,We recently purchased two pieces of property on 15th which we hoped to develop in the coming years.,24,,
104,0.97,747.88,753.486,"Once we do, it will make us a large business in the district.",24,,
105,0.97,753.486,763.562,Typically developers and large property owners are against bias because the assessment Outreaches the benefit.,24,,
106,0.97,763.562,766.632,But we are supporters of this Bia.,24,,
107,0.97,766.632,787.92,"Our office is on Broadway and we are there for a part of the Broadway Bia, and we see the positive effects of the cleaning, tree lighting, ability to convene as a group and obtain additional grants.",24,,
108,0.97,787.92,805.704,"We the outside of our buildings and when there's issues like utility upgrades along Street closures, there's no body to mitigate the negative impact This brings to businesses.",24,,
109,0.97,805.704,824.156,"We'll end up paying a considerable amount, likely to the benefit of the store front businesses, but we are in support of the formation of the Bia.",24,,
110,0.97,824.156,824.657,"Thank you, Jill.",25,,
111,0.97,824.657,832.198,I believe that was the last Speaker we had signed up.,25,,
112,0.97,832.198,837.903,The public hearing on Council bill 120162 is now closed.,25,,
113,0.97,837.903,841.607,We'll move onto briefing and discussion.,25,,
114,0.97,841.607,852.318,"First we'll hear an overview of the Bia formation process and the city's role in the process, then the proponents of the 15th Avenue Bia will present their proposal.",25,,
115,0.97,852.318,871.37,We'll have time for questions from colleagues about the presentation.,25,,
116,0.97,871.37,873.239,"Yolanda hope, council central staff.",26,,
117,0.97,873.239,882.715,"I want to give a brief overview of the steps required to establish a business improvement area, also known as a Bia.",26,,
118,0.97,882.715,893.859,"The procedures are governed by state through and city policies, adopted by resolution 131567 in 2016.",26,,
119,0.97,893.859,908.908,"Per these adopted policies, the city will consider a new Bia when presented with a petition representing 60% or more of the total assessed Bia.",26,,
120,0.97,908.908,922.454,"Where one rate payer would pay more than 25%, the city encourages support from those in 65%.",26,,
121,0.97,922.454,928.994,A single rate payer would represent nearly 38% of the total assessment.,26,,
122,0.97,928.994,944.209,"Earlier this year proponents submitted petitions signed by potential rate payers representing almost 73% of the total assessment, exceeding the 63% threshold.",26,,
123,0.97,944.209,948.08,Clerk file 322031 is where these can be found.,26,,
124,0.97,948.08,956.021,"Creating a new Bia is intensive, multiple pieces of legislation required by state law.",26,,
125,0.97,956.021,980.779,"There is a resolution to initiate the consideration of the Bia, then establishing the intent of Thebia, and the ordinance that creates the Bia and levies the special assessment to fund activities.",26,,
126,0.97,980.779,997.563,"August 9th, the Council adopted resolution 32013, initiating consideration and resolution 32014 announcing the city's intent to establish the Bia.",26,,
127,0.97,997.563,1007.005,August 16th the Council introduced the third piece of legislation.,26,,
128,0.97,1007.005,1020.352,"As required by state law, the notice was published in the Seattle times and daily Commerce and mailed to all potential rate payers at least ten days ahead of the hearing.",26,,
129,0.97,1020.352,1033.599,"Looking at the next meeting September 21st, the city will continue to consider amendments and possibly vote on legislation.",26,,
130,0.97,1033.599,1036.135,"If anyone has questions, let me know.",26,,
131,0.97,1036.135,1043.776,Otherwise I'll turn it over to Phillip in the office of economic development.,26,,
132,0.97,1043.776,1048.847,"Thank you, Yolanda.",27,,
133,0.97,1048.847,1049.548,"Good afternoon, Councilmembers.",27,,
134,0.97,1049.548,1068.934,I'll be providing a short overview about the current program out of the office of economic development along with baseline information regarding the 15th Avenue proposal.,27,,
135,0.97,1088.821,1095.494,Some of the general appeal is providing sustainable funding for collective action within a business district and corridor.,27,,
136,0.97,1095.494,1107.706,"The revenue is billed and collected by the city, and Oed establish the annual contract with the program manager that outlines a budget and work plan.",27,,
137,0.97,1107.706,1117.549,That budget and work plan is approved at an annual meeting by all rate payers within the boundaries.,27,,
138,0.97,1117.549,1128.894,They have been a vital partner between city departments and stake holders and the city as a whole.,27,,
139,0.97,1128.894,1145.21,"With our ten ten bias, we have ten currently that run the gamut.",27,,
140,0.97,1145.21,1147.145,Our smallest is in Columbia city.,27,,
141,0.97,1147.145,1165.464,"The 15th Avenue will be slightly bigger in terms of geographic coverage and budget, but similar in terms of overall size and budget and work scope.",27,,
142,0.97,1170.702,1175.607,Some of the programs also middle the business community and general employees of their districts.,27,,
143,0.97,1175.607,1189.955,"We have a number of chambers in Association across the city, including the 15th Avenue Association over the past couple decades to adapt to the growing nature of the district.",27,,
144,0.97,1189.955,1212.077,"These are some of the programs a Bia can provide in terms of a sustainable program manager and funding to provide these efforts in economic development, professional management, advocacy, public ground improvements and marketing promotions.",27,,
145,0.97,1212.077,1220.519,"As Yolanda alluded to, the process requires 60% of support from identified rate payers.",27,,
146,0.97,1220.519,1239.671,"We have some that are Business- based where the assessment is paid by the merchants, and others where the property owners are the direct payers.",27,,
147,0.97,1239.671,1256.221,"The community must demonstrate 60% of support, but in regard to larger entities, the city recommends 65% or more of support.",27,,
148,0.97,1256.221,1268.2,"Then the city Department does a property validation process and provide a Bia benefit analysis, reviewing the proposed plan.",27,,
149,0.97,1268.2,1278.01,We complete a racial equity tool kit out of our office based on what we can gather in terms of needs within that district.,27,,
150,0.97,1278.01,1287.452,Every five years we do program evaluation of each of our bias.,27,,
151,0.97,1287.452,1307.339,"Before I turn it over to the 15th Avenue proponents, the proposal we are reviewing and discussing today was brought on by the 15th Avenue business Association and within the proposed boundaries, there are 37 properties.",27,,
152,0.97,1307.339,1329.428,We have petitions from 29 of those property owners or representatives . There was also a Mailer sent out to confirm that there was communication that was received.,27,,
153,0.97,1329.428,1335.934,"The base budget could have a base year budget of $116,000 for seven years.",27,,
154,0.97,1335.934,1351.95,Additional details will be provided at the next presentation by the 15th Avenue merchants group.,27,,
155,0.97,1351.95,1382.447,"The components are total appraisal value and total lost footage . with that, I'll turn it over if there are no Follow- up questions at this moment, to the 15th Avenue proponents, and they will go over the details of their proposal.",27,,
156,0.97,1382.447,1396.561,"I have a question, Madam chair.",28,,
157,0.97,1396.561,1408.006,"Phil, I know you walked us through this before.",29,,
158,0.97,1408.006,1414.079,"First of all, I didn't get a chance to look at the map.",29,,
159,0.97,1414.079,1420.886,Is there only one north of the rail yard and that's B-Dub?,29,,
160,0.97,1420.886,1421.486,That's right.,30,,
161,0.97,1421.486,1439.571,Those at the moment are still in Explorational phases and we are looking at if this is the right approach for their district.,30,,
162,0.97,1439.571,1441.907,I understand the procedural and due process.,31,,
163,0.97,1441.907,1444.743,Mine is a little more organic.,31,,
164,0.97,1444.743,1446.978,How does that start?,31,,
165,0.97,1446.978,1465.23,You say there's a merchants Association and 72% of people came forward . is that what you're talking about with Explorational conversations?,31,,
166,0.97,1465.23,1496.361,"I'm worried there are some neighborhoods and areas and business areas that may need to organize and have a Bia, and we are going to see that kind of growth where we're at . So how does that really begin?",31,,
167,0.97,1496.361,1501.066,There are two main ways.,32,,
168,0.97,1501.066,1504.769,"One, help an existing organization.",32,,
169,0.97,1504.769,1510.408,"The Ballard alliance originated from the Ballard Chamber of Commerce, which has been around like more than two decades.",32,,
170,0.97,1510.408,1526.691,They have already had the staff capacity and stake holders from a business property and residential standpoint to dig deep into that conversation about the Bia.,32,,
171,0.97,1526.691,1556.922,"With those districts that are just starting to form, we are working with a number of those neighborhood groups in Chamber groups or emerging groups, so we'll make annual grants to those organizations to kind of mobilize and figure out the next steps for them.",32,,
172,0.97,1556.922,1567.599,"Sometimes we just want to form a Chamber of Commerce, want to form a neighborhood Association, then downstream in two weeks.",32,,
173,0.97,1567.599,1571.136,I guess it's dependent on the neighborhood.,32,,
174,0.97,1571.136,1587.352,One of the biggest things I've heard from folks is we are attempting to either solve issues or there's an opportunity for us to get ahead of the curvature.,32,,
175,0.97,1587.352,1589.387,"Might be Gentrification, might be crime.",32,,
176,0.97,1589.387,1598.163,"When you do the rate payers and they pay, do they pay quarterly or yearly?",33,,
177,0.97,1598.163,1601.967,It depends on the district.,34,,
178,0.97,1601.967,1607.839,Generally speaking it's quarterly or Biannually.,34,,
179,0.97,1607.839,1615.814,"In the case of this Bia, it would be Biannually.",34,,
180,0.97,1615.814,1628.159,This sounds like a local improvement district like the lid we just did on the waterfront.,35,,
181,0.97,1628.159,1633.932,But this would be for added amenities and things.,35,,
182,0.97,1633.932,1644.175,"So if it's provided in the state law, is there a good example that it's been the most successful?",35,,
183,0.97,1644.175,1644.909,It came out of somewhere.,35,,
184,0.97,1644.909,1653.718,In terms of the formation process or service delivery over time of the organization?,36,,
185,0.97,1653.718,1670.669,"Yeah, when people asked us a quick history on the lid, it's a civic duty responsibility if businesses want this.",37,,
186,0.97,1670.669,1677.575,I'm asking if there's a comparison with bias with that kind of history?,37,,
187,0.97,1677.575,1677.942,Sure.,38,,
188,0.97,1677.942,1706.404,"I think a quick distinction I would make, the difference between the lids and Bia's, the Bia budget and plan is organized by the District and every rate payer can can vote yes or no on that proposal.",38,,
189,0.97,1711.309,1720.852,Hopefully there's continuous cooperation . The lid is much more expansive.,38,,
190,0.97,1720.852,1730.595,"I think we know a number of our business districts, if not all, have faced tremendous challenges over the last 18 months.",38,,
191,0.97,1730.595,1779.611,"If you look at the areas that have the most availability to make that happen, a lot of bias are leading the way in that war . I think it's hard to pick one or two examples, but if you look at the districts, their work speaks for themselves, especially over the last 18 months.",38,,
192,0.97,1779.611,1783.081,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez for those deep questions.",39,,
193,0.97,1783.081,1783.448,Appreciate it.,39,,
194,0.97,1783.448,1801.332,So we are going to move on to the actual proponents of the Bia Bia.,39,,
195,0.97,1801.332,1802.534,So it's Jeff and Jill?,39,,
196,0.97,1802.534,1813.178,I'm going to go ahead and share my screen and get started.,40,,
197,0.97,1813.178,1840.705,"I'm Danielle Holton, the owner of the technical cafe on 15th Avenue East, and Jeff is a resident in the District as well, and Ownsa business in the district.",40,,
198,0.97,1840.705,1847.579,"We are both part of the 15th Avenue merchants Association, which has been brought up a couple times.",40,,
199,0.97,1847.579,1853.017,This is a brief background into the 15th Avenue East merchants Association.,40,,
200,0.97,1853.017,1871.269,We are a group of small business owners that formed in 2013 and we have acted as a leader for the neighborhood.,40,,
201,0.97,1871.269,1910.975,"We have meetings and talk about issues on the street or specific things the businesses are dealing with . It's also a point of contact with the city, a small group of merchants.",40,,
202,0.97,1910.975,1937.035,"Around three years ago we started discussing this potential of a Bia and had several meetings both formal and informal where we had members of the Oed come in, and informal ones with the merchants and pros and Cons.",40,,
203,0.97,1937.035,1952.15,"Over the last three years, we have had three to five meetings of this and whether or not this would be good for our neighborhood.",40,,
204,0.97,1952.15,1958.356,It was unanimous this is what we wanted to do.,40,,
205,0.97,1958.356,1983.047,"This group formed to try and get it passed . over the last year we started reaching out to them and getting support, which is exciting as a small business person on the street.",40,,
206,0.97,1983.047,1995.293,"One of the things that became apparent, we are all volunteering our time.",41,,
207,0.97,1995.293,1997.562,Our time is limited.,41,,
208,0.97,1997.562,2017.915,"When the hit, I think it became really important to advocate for the maybe and things like access to grants, just moving the city forward.",41,,
209,0.97,2017.915,2041.339,"Just to drive that home a little bit, it seemed like the next step in the Association and we have seen successful models around the city and looks like a great model for community collaboration.",42,,
210,0.97,2041.339,2058.156,"It gives us grants with a potential employee and a point of contact with the city, a clear way to connect.",42,,
211,0.97,2058.156,2066.764,And it's a way to use local funds raised locally from the businesses here for local programming.,42,,
212,0.97,2066.764,2087.185,"I think also one of the things that's so unique about this street was it started with a small group of merchants, but we have the ability that we can leverage their money to support small businesses.",43,,
213,0.97,2087.185,2101.466,And I think the large rate payers are very invested in our neighborhood and would like to help with small business owners.,44,,
214,0.97,2101.466,2110.575,That was the message we got.,44,,
215,0.97,2110.575,2135.166,So we currently have 73% of stake holders that signed the petition to potentially get passed at the beginning of the year.,44,,
216,0.97,2135.166,2144.876,Our working group represents around 13% of the total district.,44,,
217,0.97,2144.876,2155.786,We have had several pros and Cons discussions about forming the Bia.,44,,
218,0.97,2155.786,2169.133,Formally we mailed--or paper mailed every rate payer physical invitations in April and held two virtual public meetings for the potential rate payers.,44,,
219,0.97,2169.133,2173.905,Can I stop you there for just a minute?,45,,
220,0.97,2173.905,2195.626,"As you're talking, this Ises a big part of my question here, the engagement with the business community there, because a lot of this is about rate payers.",45,,
221,0.97,2195.626,2219.75,"Even though they are encouraged by the occasion and indicating it was happening with smaller tenants as well, we are hearing from some tenants that they were not aware of this effort.",45,,
222,0.97,2219.75,2235.166,Can you talk about the difference in the kind of conversations you were having with the property owners and with the merchants or the tenants?,45,,
223,0.97,2235.166,2253.918,"Yes, absolutely . I think there was a lot of discussions Prepandemic with the merchants and the 15th Avenue merchants Association.",46,,
224,0.97,2253.918,2258.255,Even hunters capital and those type of players were not involved in that.,46,,
225,0.97,2258.255,2287.718,It was just the 15th Avenue merchants group . The working group formed out of that . Jeff and I were in that.,46,,
226,0.97,2287.718,2292.89,The smaller group started engaging with the city and how we'd get that process going.,46,,
227,0.97,2292.89,2305.67,"We held one In-Person meeting during the pandemic like last summer when it was still a little safe to have a masked distanced meeting, and kind of checked in.",46,,
228,0.97,2305.67,2310.141,I think this last year has provided interesting communication challenges.,46,,
229,0.97,2310.141,2321.986,So I think there were around 30 people that came and discussed this.,46,,
230,0.97,2321.986,2329.06,I'm sure some didn't choose to come to it because they didn't know what we were talking about.,46,,
231,0.97,2329.06,2332.496,"One lesson I've learned, we started talking with the rate payers.",46,,
232,0.97,2332.496,2341.672,"That was the first time we started engaging with them, summer of 2020.",46,,
233,0.97,2341.672,2355.119,I think part of it is a lesson in community engagement as well to continue to bring the Nonrate payers along as much as I can.,46,,
234,0.97,2355.119,2369.834,I know several people in the neighborhood are Nonrate payers that I believe are excited as well.,46,,
235,0.97,2369.834,2370.267,That's great.,47,,
236,0.97,2370.267,2371.502,"Go ahead, Jeff.",48,,
237,0.97,2371.502,2386.183,"One of the things, because of the Council's schedule, we sure we could get on the schedule for this year.",49,,
238,0.97,2386.183,2399.463,"When we started pulling in petitions, we got them within three weeks.",49,,
239,0.97,2399.463,2404.001,So we effectively have over 80% on board in terms of property owners at this point.,49,,
240,0.97,2404.001,2410.741,This is just a map of the boundary.,50,,
241,0.97,2410.741,2419.083,"If it were to pass, it would be the second smallest in the city, a really modest Bia.",50,,
242,0.97,2419.083,2428.559,This graph goes a little bit into that assessment formula.,50,,
243,0.97,2428.559,2439.136,"I would like to point out the majority of the rate payers in the area, it would be more than $1,200 a year, the assessment on average.",50,,
244,0.97,2439.136,2446.11,This has everything broken out but the next slide has the percentages and goes more into detail.,50,,
245,0.97,2508.973,2517.848,I see a lot of value in this for me personally because around $100 a month is what I would be pay Aing.,51,,
246,0.97,2517.848,2525.322,I see this as going further than cleaning the sidewalk or removing graffiti.,51,,
247,0.97,2525.322,2539.136,"The second largest allocation is for advocacy, which would be long-term sustaining communications.",51,,
248,0.97,2539.136,2544.074,It takes a lot of bandwidth to run that.,51,,
249,0.97,2544.074,2555.986,For a few years we couldn't do it so we'd love to have a staffing person to help with events like that and apply for grants at the neighborhood level.,51,,
250,0.97,2555.986,2568.499,That really leads into the global pandemic response or Covid-19 response and supporting small businesses and employees and residents in our neighborhood.,51,,
251,0.97,2568.499,2587.685,Looking at best practices of of other bias and how to help our district move through the current unprecedented time and into a sustainable and vibrant future.,51,,
252,0.97,2587.685,2596.427,Our neighborhood is about to go through some really big changes regardless of the pandemic or not with large developments coming in the next couple years.,51,,
253,0.97,2596.427,2604.935,So I see this as a great way to help our neighborhood thrive during that time.,51,,
254,0.97,2604.935,2614.211,One of the things that stands out to me is the grants.,52,,
255,0.97,2614.211,2625.322,"If this group didn't exist, we wouldn't be made aware of the recent grant with tens of thousands of dollars available to help businesses come out of the pandemic.",52,,
256,0.97,2625.322,2633.53,"I think a group like this and having the staff time to do that, as a business owner, I don't have any more time.",52,,
257,0.97,2633.53,2634.598,That's a huge resource.,52,,
258,0.97,2634.598,2664.194,"To that point as well, just the discussions of how we're trying to form this, talking about how to survive the pandemic and survive this, I feel like it's exciting to see the possibilities of having a formal organization here because I see those doors starting to open in the last month.",53,,
259,0.97,2664.194,2674.838,I have a couple slides here with community members that have reached out in support of it.,53,,
260,0.97,2674.838,2685.249,There's two at the end.,53,,
261,0.97,2690.02,2699.997,"We thought we'd have seven business owners, one large, one small and others of any size.",53,,
262,0.97,2699.997,2705.202,The majority of the owners here would be small rate payers.,53,,
263,0.97,2705.202,2710.441,We also want one resident and two Nonpayers on the board.,53,,
264,0.97,2710.441,2714.278,I wanted to about the board makeup.,54,,
265,0.97,2714.278,2720.784,It indicated in the previous slide that tenants would be on the rate payer board.,54,,
266,0.97,2720.784,2721.785,Can you talk about that?,54,,
267,0.97,2721.785,2724.221,That's a good question.,55,,
268,0.97,2724.221,2729.493,I'm going to stop sharing my screen if you don't mind.,55,,
269,0.97,2729.493,2729.76,Sure.,56,,
270,0.97,2729.76,2740.971,"So I think that Jeff or Phillip may be able to answer, but we don't have many residents getting assessed.",57,,
271,0.97,2740.971,2747.578,"Jeff, do you know how many tenants are in the assessment versus Nondirect rate payers?",57,,
272,0.97,2747.578,2752.349,There's only four or five buildings at the moment.,58,,
273,0.97,2752.349,2757.454,"I'm sorry, I'm not talking about just residents.",59,,
274,0.97,2757.454,2757.921,Business owners?,60,,
275,0.97,2757.921,2760.724,Who are not property owners.,61,,
276,0.97,2760.724,2771.735,It's important to have at minimum three people on the board that are not district rate payers.,62,,
277,0.97,2771.735,2779.643,And 15th is a really interviewing neighborhood to me in Seattle.,62,,
278,0.97,2779.643,2788.519,There are not many Neighborhoodseses in Seattle anymore where a small business owner can also purchase their property.,62,,
279,0.97,2788.519,2803.267,"There are a handful of business owners that also own their property here, which is great, I think.",62,,
280,0.97,2803.267,2807.371,Sure.,63,,
281,0.97,2807.371,2809.039,Okay.,64,,
282,0.97,2809.039,2815.145,"I think I have one more question, them Colleagueses can Chime in.",64,,
283,0.97,2815.145,2825.289,Can you talk about the efforts being made--I know there's programming you indicated already.,64,,
284,0.97,2825.289,2838.001,But are there any Programses or things in place that could address economic recovery or displacement in particular of these small businesses?,64,,
285,0.97,2838.001,2855.719,Councilmember Pedersen was helpful in the last conversation we had when it comes to addressing or trying to prevent displacement of the small businesses.,64,,
286,0.97,2855.719,2860.891,"What we can do is pretty limited, but right now we can't do anything.",65,,
287,0.97,2860.891,2887.15,"So I think the first point is really to assemble staff time to help build a plan to help people come and shop and dine here, and mainly connect to other bias and with the city to understand what resources are available.",65,,
288,0.97,2887.15,2889.453,I live just a few doors down from the neighborhood.,65,,
289,0.97,2889.453,2894.057,I don't have time to research grants and things like that.,65,,
290,0.97,2894.057,2895.659,I know we're all completely tapped out.,65,,
291,0.97,2895.659,2909.139,I think this is a starting point and resource where I have one person that I can go to for help and they can maybe connect me.,65,,
292,0.97,2909.139,2936.433,"Yeah, reaching out to others about the strategy, we have several vacant store fronts right now and I would love to see those filled with small businesses and folks that are trying to get started or struggling, and also what are the best strategies for engaging landlords and can we help those businesses survive?",66,,
293,0.97,2936.433,2939.836,I know other neighborhoods are investigating that as well.,66,,
294,0.97,2939.836,2959.356,"I would love to even in Q4 connect with some of those neighborhoods, see if we're able to do for our neighborhood even before this starts.",66,,
295,0.97,2959.356,2966.797,"I would to add that you have the big public perception, is 15th closing?",67,,
296,0.97,2966.797,2985.415,I think this is great news about the neighborhood reinvesting in itself and gives us a chance to support the neighborhood and bring people back to the street.,67,,
297,0.97,2985.415,2985.782,Thank you.,68,,
298,0.97,2985.782,2993.09,"Colleagues, any questions for the Presenters?",69,,
299,0.97,2993.09,2993.59,Councilmember Pedersen?,69,,
300,0.97,2993.59,2995.225,"Thank you, chair Morales.",70,,
301,0.97,2995.225,3005.902,It was a pleasure working on this with the committee.,70,,
302,0.97,3005.902,3018.148,"I really appreciate the mentioning of preventing displacement, especially when Danielle was mentioning the real estate development that will be occurring.",70,,
303,0.97,3018.148,3035.165,"It sounds like when you're talking about grants that you may be interested in pursuing, seems like you might want to help out businesses that are struggling and in danger of displacement.",70,,
304,0.97,3035.165,3048.311,"We wrote it into the legislation and it was part of the mission of the Bia, that preventing displacement was part of the mission.",70,,
305,0.97,3048.311,3053.45,I would certainly support an Enhancement such as that.,70,,
306,0.97,3053.45,3081.311,"Then in terms of getting at those businesses that, if they are subject to a triple net lease and all costs are being passed to them, it could be another refinement to identify the Triple-Leases.",70,,
307,0.97,3081.311,3086.716,"They may not feel like they have a voice, yet they're paying for it.",70,,
308,0.97,3086.716,3103.567,"Curious to the thoughts on those, and also recognize this is in Councilmember Sawant's district.",70,,
309,0.97,3103.567,3117.614,"I guess I will say that the items you listed, fees being passed through and businesses being displaced are very important to me.",71,,
310,0.97,3117.614,3126.49,"It's been difficult through the pandemic, seeing more and more businesses being displaced or not able to survive.",71,,
311,0.97,3126.49,3128.458,I'm invested in this neighborhood.,71,,
312,0.97,3128.458,3135.799,There's a lot of established businesses I would like to see continue and thrive.,71,,
313,0.97,3135.799,3147.911,I see this Bia as a really amazing way to amplify what we can do in the neighborhood to help those folks.,71,,
314,0.97,3147.911,3161.258,"If there's language that could be put into it or anything like that, I think that would be powerful for our neighborhood.",71,,
315,0.97,3161.258,3168.431,"Councilmember Sawant, I want to give you an opportunity to Chime in here.",72,,
316,0.97,3168.431,3174.538,"No pressure, but we want to acknowledge we have a full Committee, which is nice.",72,,
317,0.97,3174.538,3174.738,Okay.,72,,
318,0.97,3174.738,3180.31,"Well, I want to thank you for a robust conversation.",72,,
319,0.97,3180.31,3189.386,I think it's important that we do consider the two things that Councilmember Pedersen and I talked about.,72,,
320,0.97,3189.386,3203.033,I'm considering amendments to address the Antidisplacement question and ensuring representation by the tenants.,72,,
