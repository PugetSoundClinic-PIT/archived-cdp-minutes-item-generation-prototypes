0,0.97,21.521,21.821,Good afternoon.,0,,
1,0.97,21.821,29.396,This is the regularly scheduled meeting of the Sustainability and Renters' rights committee of the Seattle city council.,0,,
2,0.97,29.396,32.198,"The time is 2:05 PM on February 25, 2020.",0,,
3,0.97,32.198,46.88,"Am joined by Councilmember Morales, Councilmember Pedersen, Councilmember Juarez . Thank you for being here.",0,,
4,0.97,46.88,48.214,"Hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted.",0,,
5,0.97,48.214,62.429,In today's meeting we will hold our first discussion with the Seattle office of Sustainability and environment who will present the work of their office and work plan for the year.,0,,
6,0.97,62.429,70.27,"I just wanted to mention, one of the things they will be responsible for is supporting the newly established green new deal oversight board.",0,,
7,0.97,70.27,73.673,Over the next few months we will be responsible for making those appointments to the board.,0,,
8,0.97,73.673,98.231,"So if anyone watching this channel is interested in applying or if they feel they know committee members community members who would fit the role of board member of the green new deal oversight, then please contact my office and we will make sure that we include all the information for Councilmembers in the committee when the question of appointments comes up.",0,,
9,0.97,98.231,101.267,Hopefully I think the staffing question will begin in April.,0,,
10,0.97,101.267,103.269,Hopefully the apartments will be done by June.,0,,
11,0.97,103.269,114.514,Before we bring the office of Sustainability environment to the table let's the public comment.,0,,
12,0.97,114.514,116.549,No one is signed up for public comment.,1,,
13,0.97,116.549,118.785,Is there anyone not signed up who wishes to speak!,2,,
14,0.97,118.785,119.352,Please come forward.,2,,
15,0.97,119.352,131.131,Please write your name and you have two minutes.,2,,
16,0.97,132.132,145.044,I am with a specialty hearth retailer vessel natural gas fireplaces and barbecues . 26 employees.,3,,
17,0.97,145.044,151.584,I'm also on the board of the barbecue Association which represents small businesses like mine.,3,,
18,0.97,151.584,155.922,And manufacturers in Seattle.,3,,
19,0.97,155.922,168.601,I am really only here today to voice our concerns about any conversations or proposals that may have something to do with the natural gas been for commercial residential.,3,,
20,0.97,168.601,172.272,And if there are going to be conversations about that we would really like to be at the table.,3,,
21,0.97,172.272,176.276,Because there's a lot of jobs that depend on that and a lot of people who depend on the products.,3,,
22,0.97,176.276,177.81,That's what I'm here to say today.,3,,
23,0.97,177.81,178.611,Thank you.,3,,
24,0.97,178.611,180.246,Thank you.,4,,

26,0.97,181.714,185.752,If you want to neck with Ted for my office we are happy to have a meeting.,4,,
27,0.97,185.752,186.519,Of course.,4,,
28,0.97,186.519,191.057,Anyone else want to speak?,4,,
29,0.97,191.057,204.571,Seeing none we will close public comment and we will have Presenters come to the table.,4,,
30,0.97,210.91,213.746,I don't know how to interpret the lack of public Commenters.,5,,
31,0.97,213.746,224.023,[Laughter],6,,
32,0.97,224.624,227.227,As you know introductions for the record and then take it away.,7,,
33,0.97,227.227,233.299,Thank you for the record I name is Jessica Finn Coven and I am the director of the office of Sustainability and environment.,8,,
34,0.97,233.299,236.569,"Good afternoon I am a Lylianna Allala, the assistant director at ose.",9,,
35,0.97,236.569,239.105,Yolanda central staff.,10,,
36,0.97,239.105,246.512,Let me first start by thanking you all for having us here.,11,,
37,0.97,246.512,250.984,I have been the director of Osc for about four years.,11,,
38,0.97,250.984,257.123,And I can't think of another time I an opportunity to come in front of the new Committee and just talk about our work and hear your questions and interest.,11,,
39,0.97,257.123,261.728,"Really, we are excited to be here today and appreciate you having us here.",11,,
40,0.97,261.728,265.698,I will add page numbers to her next Powerpoint.,11,,
41,0.97,265.698,276.042,We definitely will.,11,,
42,0.97,276.609,278.444,We are here to talk a little bit about Osc.,11,,
43,0.97,278.444,279.012,Who we are.,11,,
44,0.97,279.012,282.048,We will provide a little more background because I know there are more Councilmembers here.,11,,
45,0.97,282.048,292.158,A little about our office and then dig into more depth about the programs we have been working on and what we will be doing in the coming year.,11,,
46,0.97,292.158,293.626,"Osc, were in our 20th year.",11,,
47,0.97,293.626,300.566,We were established as an executive office that focused on internal city operations and how we could make those operations more sustainable.,11,,
48,0.97,300.566,322.755,Overtime it has evolved and grown to focus yes on city municipal operations but really look at a city wide response to Sustainability and environmental priorities and ensuring we are a cross city departments coordinated committee to come together to advance environmental priorities.,11,,
49,0.97,322.755,324.691,There are about 30 of us at ose.,11,,
50,0.97,324.691,332.999,We are small but mighty.,11,,
51,0.97,332.999,335.068,Our staff is without a doubt our biggest resource and asset.,11,,
52,0.97,335.068,340.106,They are an amazing group of people who come together to be innovative and really serve in their work.,11,,
53,0.97,340.106,344.811,We like to go to Mariners games together which is what this picture is.,11,,
54,0.97,344.811,350.316,We were very excited last summer.,11,,
55,0.97,350.316,359.025,We are focused as I said in part a cross city departments but also with partners outside of city government to ensure that we are coming together to find Sustainability solutions.,11,,
56,0.97,359.025,377.51,And like all city departments we are guided by the racial and social justice of the city and we see our priority at ose at undoing institutional racism by undoing injustice.,11,,
57,0.97,377.51,378.745,We will talk about that work.,11,,
58,0.97,378.745,381.948,I will get into more detail on her program areas that we focus in three core areas.,11,,
59,0.97,381.948,386.052,First of course meeting the climate challenge.,11,,
60,0.97,386.052,394.627,"We work to reduce pollution from buildings, to reduce Lucian from transportation and to really advance climate justice.",11,,
61,0.97,394.627,412.278,"We work to champion environmental equity, both through police based environmental justice programs like our Snohomish Valley program but also through our broader equity and environment initiative which is designed to make sure that all people benefit from our environmental progress.",11,,
62,0.97,412.278,429.695,Those communities that have disproportionately faced environmental injustice really centered in her work and centered in developing priorities and solutions they want us to advance.,11,,
63,0.97,429.695,435.601,Finally we work to advance livable and sustainable communities through healthy and local food work in urban forestry.,11,,
64,0.97,435.601,448.915,"Taking in a little bit to our climate change work, you can see here this graphic illustrates the major sources of our core greenhouse gas emissions.",11,,
65,0.97,448.915,452.919,Those are the emissions the city policy most has control to impact.,11,,
66,0.97,452.919,463.396,"So a lot of cities report their core missions and then broader scope emissions which include industrial processes, and things that city policy impact less.",11,,
67,0.97,463.396,477.944,We release both the full scope and our core missions every two years and our greenhouse gas inventory.,11,,
68,0.97,477.944,482.114,You can see here as well Seattle's climate leadership dates back to 2005 when we released our first climate action plan.,11,,
69,0.97,482.114,488.554,"I don't mean to interrupt your flow, and if you want to answer this question as you go through the slides that's totally fine.",12,,
70,0.97,488.554,500.633,You mentioned that the numbers you have there are specifically also relating to what comes under the city Purview in transportation and building and energy and so one.,12,,
71,0.97,500.633,511.677,And the obviously goes to the core of the whole new green new deal proposal that last year was signed off on which we need to implement.,12,,
72,0.97,511.677,526.592,"And I just wanted to hear from you, if in general you could talk about what are the other sources of carbon emissions and pollution and climate change that we see in general?",12,,
73,0.97,526.592,535.401,Vesely in Seattle we don't have the industrial as much as in some other areas may be.,12,,
74,0.97,535.401,537.003,So if you could just talk about that?,12,,
75,0.97,537.003,560.026,"And sort of put some details onto the statistic that I think is very important that is highlighted by the climate justice movement about how the vast majority of admissions or industrial sources and unless we address it at a bigger level, only making changes at a personal level among households is not going to go far enough.",12,,
76,0.97,560.026,560.993,That's a great question.,13,,
77,0.97,560.993,564.33,Let me touch on that and I will jump back in to this graphic.,13,,
78,0.97,564.33,582.448,"Are major, what we see here, waste, building emissions, largely natural gas heating peak, quite a number of industrial Pollutants as we do still have a core industrial base.",13,,
79,0.97,582.448,587.553,"We have that broken down by industry so we can look at cement for example or steel, and we can provide more of that data.",13,,
80,0.97,587.553,596.462,But I think a really important point is that they all come from upstream sources.,13,,
81,0.97,596.462,598.164,Of course the choices we make individually matter.,13,,
82,0.97,598.164,600.333,And we try to help people in making those choices.,13,,
83,0.97,600.333,611.077,But these are structural issues and structural emissions with no structural and systemic change we will never curb the climate crisis.,13,,
84,0.97,611.077,618.184,Also it's not the decisions of one family or one individual that has caused climate change.,13,,
85,0.97,618.184,623.489,It's a bigger systemic issue and that is absolutely where we need to solve the problem.,13,,
86,0.97,623.489,631.597,It's not just the fault of our residents here in Seattle and the burden can't be only on them.,13,,
87,0.97,631.597,632.198,That answer your question?,13,,
88,0.97,632.198,632.665,Thank you.,13,,
89,0.97,632.665,633.866,Just briefly--go ahead.,13,,
90,0.97,633.866,638.104,Thank you.,14,,
91,0.97,638.104,652.118,"Prior to coming to the committee I reviewed the annual mission report, it looks like Councilmember Pedersen is reviewing them now and the answer to my question is actually listed by coincidence of what Councilmember Pedersen is looking at.",14,,
92,0.97,652.118,685.918,"But I'm going to ask the question anyway just for folks in the audience and for the people viewing, when we are talking about the building -Based emissions, what percentage of that are residential versus commercial, in the emissions, and then also what kind of strategies could Reuse, particularly with commercial buildings in the downtown core like a lot of buildings in my district, to transition from natural Gas- based heating to more Electric- based heating and the feasibility of that technology.",14,,
93,0.97,686.052,690.122,I'm going to answer the first question.,15,,
94,0.97,690.122,692.358,Our building emissions are a little over one third.,15,,
95,0.97,692.358,696.862,35% for all buildings.,15,,
96,0.97,696.862,699.432,That is roughly Half-And-Half between residential and commercial.,15,,
97,0.97,699.432,717.149,"It's 55-45, I think 55% is commercial emissions and 45% of that 35, really we have roughly a third of the emissions, half are residential buildings and half commercial buildings.",15,,
98,0.97,717.149,725.691,Is that what you have in front of you?,15,,
99,0.97,725.691,743.909,I am going to dig in specifically to the issue of commercial buildings and what we have been doing . If it's okay I will hold your question and if I don't answer it at the end make sure you told me . a quick NOTE on how we are doing all this work.,16,,
100,0.97,743.909,751.517,"In 2005 when Council adopted the climate action plan, they adopted a goal for Seattle to be carbon neutral by 2050.",16,,
101,0.97,751.517,757.323,And some very specific target sector by sector targets by 2030.,16,,
102,0.97,757.323,759.925,We measure our missions as I said every two years.,16,,
103,0.97,759.925,763.429,We measure against the 2008 baseline.,16,,
104,0.97,763.429,769.535,That the first year we feel we have really good data that is worth measuring against.,16,,
105,0.97,769.535,771.804,"Since 2008, we have reduced emissions about 6%.",16,,
106,0.97,771.804,787.419,We are happy we have seen some reduction but I want to put a fine point on the fact that 6% is not consistent with meeting our carbon neutrality goal or 20/30 goals.,16,,
107,0.97,787.419,790.523,"We will talk about how we are responding to that, what we are doing.",16,,
108,0.97,790.523,795.961,"We know certainly the response to climate change, the climate crisis is bigger than ose.",16,,
109,0.97,795.961,798.164,We need to do more work.,16,,
110,0.97,798.164,808.04,Is at 6% and absolute 6% reduction or is it 6% per building?,17,,
111,0.97,808.04,811.777,It's 6% of our core emissions.,18,,
112,0.97,811.777,812.978,"Buildings, transportation, waste.",18,,
113,0.97,812.978,815.881,Okay.,19,,
114,0.97,815.881,829.461,"And then we do have, I don't know this off the top of my head, we have per transportation, per building in the building sector commercial versus residential, we have a lot of data on air emissions inventory.",19,,
115,0.97,829.461,835.201,"We follow the carbon disclosure project, it's kind of the standard by which cities report.",19,,
116,0.97,835.201,837.403,Is very detailed and very prescribed.,19,,
117,0.97,837.403,842.274,We have quite a bit of data.,19,,
118,0.97,842.274,853.619,"Digging in, starting with buildings, as we were just talking about buildings are about one third of our emissions.",20,,
119,0.97,853.619,861.927,Most of that comes from use of natural gas as a heating source.,20,,
120,0.97,861.927,867.733,"I know you all work sometimes with the Department of construction and inspection, they control our building codes.",20,,
121,0.97,867.733,871.47,So they really look at how we can curb emissions from new buildings.,20,,
122,0.97,871.47,883.916,We realize that that is incredibly important.,20,,
123,0.97,883.916,887.152,"But in 2050, about 80% of the buildings here today are still going to be here.",20,,
124,0.97,887.152,894.059,So we need to figure out a way to be reducing the carbon content of the buildings that are here today and have a number of policies over the years to help get us there.,20,,
125,0.97,894.059,897.596,We started with the idea that information is really the first step to action.,20,,
126,0.97,897.596,915.581,"2008, we passed an ordinance to require buildings 20,000 square feet and greater to annually report their energy use in the carbon emissions associated with that to us each year.",20,,
127,0.97,915.581,930.863,"We found that those buildings, just from reporting their energy use, have fairly significantly reduce their emissions.",20,,
128,0.97,930.863,934.3,"In those buildings that benchmark the data, we have seen greenhouse gas emissions reductions of about 6%.",20,,
129,0.97,934.3,939.805,"Certainly not enough in the scale of the crisis, but shows us that when you know your information you can manage it better.",20,,
130,0.97,939.805,968.0,"We were also able to hold upon that energy Benchmarking plan in more recently acquired requirements for 50,000 square feet and greater to periodically tune up there buildings or take the lower cost measures to make sure they are improving their building performances.",20,,
131,0.97,968.901,972.905,In the energy world it's often referred to as a Retro commissioning but we call it our building Tuneups program.,20,,
132,0.97,972.905,974.907,The first Compliancy for that was last year in 2019.,20,,
133,0.97,974.907,977.343,We had about 400 buildings that participated in complied with the program.,20,,
134,0.97,977.343,983.048,We expect about a 6-9% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the building the do that program.,20,,
135,0.97,983.048,991.957,We have seen case studies where the emissions reductions have been significantly more.,20,,
136,0.97,991.957,997.262,For example one of the buildings we tuned up was a Seattle justice center on annual reduction of 20% of greenhouse gases.,20,,
137,0.97,997.262,1001.467,Sometimes going through the process can have significantly more reductions.,20,,
138,0.97,1001.467,1007.172,I am interested in this workforce partnership question.,21,,
139,0.97,1007.172,1012.077,And in general the transition questions.,21,,
140,0.97,1012.077,1025.124,Can you talk a little bit about whether there is a pay difference in the means of fossil fuel buildings versus electric buildings?,21,,
141,0.97,1025.124,1040.305,And is there a plan to help transition employees who are maintaining into having the skills they need to maintain the other buildings.,21,,
142,0.97,1040.305,1043.175,We don't know the answer about pay difference but we can look into that.,22,,
143,0.97,1043.175,1067.132,"My guess would be there is not, but again I want to check this, the reason I would guess that is because the types of folks who maintain the systems, the resource conservation managers of buildings, I believe it's often similar skills, depending on what the system of the building is.",22,,
144,0.97,1067.132,1068.133,I don't know that for sure.,22,,
145,0.97,1068.133,1069.334,Let us dig into that more.,22,,
146,0.97,1069.334,1092.524,"In terms of things we have done to ensure the people are able to access these new jobs, we realize our building Tuneups program, it's not like it's been tens of thousands of new jobs but we knew there would be some new jobs created because we were creating a requirement for buildings to be tuned up and have someone certify that.",22,,
147,0.97,1092.524,1105.671,One thing we did his partner with Seattle public schools with the Union representing their facility workers to make sure we were able to utilize grant funding so those folks were trained and able to do the work themselves.,22,,
148,0.97,1105.671,1107.539,And the work wouldn't be Outsourced.,22,,
149,0.97,1107.539,1110.576,Which was a fear they had.,22,,
150,0.97,1110.576,1116.048,"As you have seen here, we have been working with South Seattle college.",22,,
151,0.97,1116.048,1130.696,They had a program of folks who have been studying science building engineering so we reached out and partnered with them where they are now being trained and skilled to do some of the Tuna pork.,22,,
152,0.97,1130.696,1141.006,We have been trying to look for opportunities to ensure that more folks are able to access these jobs.,22,,
153,0.97,1141.006,1150.282,"Again, that we are being intentional about making the connection between folks who need job opportunities and when we have new job opportunities.",22,,
154,0.97,1150.282,1153.485,It is something we identified in our office is wanting to get scaled up on more.,22,,
155,0.97,1153.485,1155.988,So we can really be more intentional partner on the workforce.,22,,
156,0.97,1155.988,1157.322,More question.,23,,
157,0.97,1157.322,1180.646,"This talks about for the city facilities, the transition we are going to be making, you mentioned folks working for the Seattle public schools . do you know if other unions representing city employees were part of the conversation about this decision to change city facilities from fossil fuel to Electrification?",23,,
158,0.97,1180.646,1181.446,Good question.,24,,
159,0.97,1181.446,1184.95,I don't believe so.,24,,
160,0.97,1184.95,1191.223,That was a broader policy decision of moving away from fossil fuels in city buildings.,24,,
161,0.97,1191.223,1197.729,There has been confidence that our facility staff are trained and ready and they can do the work that needs to be done.,24,,
162,0.97,1197.729,1201.967,I don't know they have had that policy conversation.,24,,
163,0.97,1201.967,1204.236,Thank you.,25,,
164,0.97,1204.236,1205.37,Other questions?,26,,
165,0.97,1205.37,1213.779,"Last point on buildings here, just as you mentioned, city facilities, we believe in leading by example.",27,,
166,0.97,1213.779,1231.396,"We have had a Long-Standing program to significantly reduce emissions in our municipal Bildings, working with city departments whom building assets, we have had about a 14% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from those city-owned buildings.",27,,
167,0.97,1231.396,1234.9,It's a program we are continuing and Scaling up in the next few years.,27,,
168,0.97,1234.9,1249.314,"On the residential side, those of you who were here last year are familiar with a lot of the work we did around an effort to confer oil heated homes to clean electric heat pumps.",27,,
169,0.97,1249.314,1255.687,About 10% of our single-family homes in Seattle still use oil as a heating source.,27,,
170,0.97,1255.687,1258.49,Which is by far the Dirtiest and most expensive heating source.,27,,
171,0.97,1258.49,1272.838,"And only is it a significant source of greenhouse gas emission, but poses health and environmental threats to our communities particularly as more and more of these tanks are leaking.",27,,
172,0.97,1272.838,1280.846,"We also realize it's expensive to make conversion and most people who have oil, it's not that they want it, it's that it's hard to convert.",27,,
173,0.97,1280.846,1293.425,And fully we were able to work with Council last year and the Mayor on a plan to transition all homes off of oil by 2028.,27,,
174,0.97,1293.425,1298.03,And create a revenue source so we are able to cover 100% of conversion costs for our lowest income residents.,27,,
175,0.97,1298.03,1304.97,"We have a few, at least two, maybe three, reports due to this Committee this year.",27,,
176,0.97,1304.97,1307.506,I will lay them out at the end of this presentation.,27,,
177,0.97,1307.572,1315.147,Ut specifically on this program to come back to let you know outreach strategy.,27,,
178,0.97,1315.147,1317.416,And will we be reporting annually on how the program is going.,27,,
179,0.97,1317.416,1319.184,We are really excited to get it going.,27,,
180,0.97,1319.184,1320.986,Please go ahead.,28,,
181,0.97,1320.986,1328.96,I have a lot of questions about this but it might be coming out of your report.,29,,
182,0.97,1328.96,1331.296,I have questions about how much this costs.,29,,
183,0.97,1331.296,1336.068,It looks like $1700 per year to make the conversion?,29,,
184,0.97,1336.068,1341.106,That is how much the average cost of oil heat per year is.,30,,
185,0.97,1341.106,1349.881,"So I guess my question is, how much is the conversion cost you are covering for those 25 households?",30,,
186,0.97,1349.881,1361.827,"How is that decided, this pilot program, that's not a lot of families covered.",30,,
187,0.97,1361.827,1365.931,And what percentage of poverty or low income are they.,30,,
188,0.97,1365.931,1370.202,"How is this funded, and will it continue?",30,,
189,0.97,1370.202,1382.147,"Let me answer what I can and take out some of the more detailed questions, especially on work opportunity, there is a slide on that.",31,,
190,0.97,1382.147,1383.014,We will back on that.,31,,
191,0.97,1383.014,1387.052,There are two programs here to some extent.,31,,
192,0.97,1387.052,1399.431,"One, we had a pilot for a few years we partnered with the heat pump manufacturer to offer $2000 rebates for homes that wanted to convert from oil to heat pump.",31,,
193,0.97,1399.431,1405.537,We have converted about 400 homes in that way.,31,,
194,0.97,1405.537,1420.051,We amended that program last year to say we want it to be more intentional about using that funding to cover all of the funds for the lowest income residents.,31,,
195,0.97,1420.051,1441.273,"We partnered with the office of housing, particularly working with the neighborhoods of beacon hill to say how could we work with folks that Oh was providing assistance for to convert those homes from oil to heat pumps to give us a better sense of costs, better sense of what we needed in this program.",31,,
196,0.97,1441.273,1463.829,"And then from there, we had a little more information, that's when we came to Council last year with a proposal that required all underground storage tanks to either be Decommissioned or replaced by 2028 and created a tax on oil heat and that revenue goes to fund the conversions.",31,,
197,0.97,1463.829,1476.241,"For anyone on utility discount program, the cost of that tax is refunded on their bill so they are not paying for the tax.",31,,
198,0.97,1476.241,1485.75,That is also how we are identifying folks to convert to cover the 100% of conversion.,31,,
199,0.97,1485.75,1497.362,We were asked by Council to expand beyond those eligible for the Udp recognizing that a lot of folks are struggling who might not be eligible for Udp.,31,,
200,0.97,1497.362,1503.268,So that is part of what we are working on coming back and reporting to you on one.,31,,
201,0.97,1503.268,1512.377,"And all the household you're talking about, for example the 400 in the pilot program, these are families that owned their homes?",32,,
202,0.97,1512.377,1516.848,We are not talking about Renters?,32,,
203,0.97,1516.848,1539.604,"Because to me, it's a gray area then because when you talk about Renters, the renting households might be low income but the landlord might actually be someone who is an Exploitative landlord but the tenants are marginalized.",32,,
204,0.97,1539.604,1540.005,Absolutely.,33,,
205,0.97,1540.005,1542.407,I'm sorry I don't have that staff at my fingertips.,33,,
206,0.97,1542.407,1545.477,I was better on this when it was in front of Council last year.,33,,
207,0.97,1545.477,1552.717,We do have data on the number of oil heated homes that are owner occupied versus rented.,33,,
208,0.97,1552.717,1560.325,"It is dramatically, do you remember what the percentage was?",33,,
209,0.97,1560.325,1561.326,I don't remember.,34,,
210,0.97,1561.326,1563.128,It seems like it was mostly homeowners.,34,,
211,0.97,1563.128,1565.196,Very low percent of Renters.,35,,
212,0.97,1565.196,1568.099,We did including the program --,35,,
213,0.97,1568.233,1570.835,Low income homeowners.,36,,
214,0.97,1570.835,1587.953,"We included in the program a Covenant that you can't raise rent, I forget the period of time, the period of time office of housing typically uses for programs like this.",37,,
215,0.97,1587.953,1593.558,"If you get funding to convert, to make sure folks were Accessing funding, converting, and then pricing people out of rentals.",37,,
216,0.97,1593.558,1600.732,It's part of the program?,38,,
217,0.97,1600.732,1602.567,It's part of the ordinance the past.,39,,
218,0.97,1602.567,1609.674,The pilot program was with Oh within their housing program.,39,,
219,0.97,1609.674,1611.476,I had a question.,40,,
220,0.97,1611.476,1623.888,"I was also tracking in the state Legislature, some legislation and I had been wondering if you've been tracking that.",40,,
221,0.97,1623.888,1625.29,Are you will address questions?,41,,
222,0.97,1625.29,1627.959,I'm getting.,41,,
223,0.97,1627.959,1638.737,"We are going to engage, pollution liability insurance agency.",42,,
224,0.97,1638.737,1647.012,Right now it's a free program anyone with oil can sign up for.,42,,
225,0.97,1647.012,1656.388,"It covers $60,000, up to $50,000 in damage if you find your tank is leaking.",42,,
226,0.97,1656.388,1667.732,A huge priority of ours is to get people signed up for plea because too many people don't know about the program.,42,,
227,0.97,1667.732,1684.249,"A deep foundation of our outreach plan is to first get people signed up for plea and then get people to do the work . There is legislation that looks at ensuring plea, it is only funded through 2030 which is why one of our focus areas is making sure everyone is off oil by 2030 so they are not stuck with the bill.",42,,
228,0.97,1684.249,1691.956,There is legislation to make sure plea is solvent until then or maybe after than.,42,,
229,0.97,1691.956,1696.428,I don't know exactly where it is right now because I know we are in the point where things keep changing.,42,,
230,0.97,1696.428,1703.268,Let me check and I can get back to you and anyone else interested in the plea legislation.,42,,
231,0.97,1703.268,1703.601,Keep going.,42,,
232,0.97,1703.601,1705.77,Moving to transportation.,42,,
233,0.97,1705.77,1709.574,Happy to come back to buildings anytime.,42,,
234,0.97,1709.574,1723.188,I guess I will say quickly that you will remember from the emissions graphic the transportation is over 60% of our emissions.,42,,
235,0.97,1723.188,1725.457,That is not because our transportation sector is dirtier than other places.,42,,
236,0.97,1725.457,1727.058,It's because our electricity is so clean.,42,,
237,0.97,1727.058,1729.294,Personally it looks like transportation is a larger proportion of our emissions.,42,,
238,0.97,1729.294,1737.268,Many of the efforts to reduce emissions from transportation aren't led by our office.,42,,
239,0.97,1737.268,1743.508,At ose we recognize that affordable housing is a huge climate solution.,42,,
240,0.97,1743.508,1756.321,"Being able to welcome more neighbors and ensure they are able to live where they work, play and go to school.",42,,
241,0.97,1756.321,1758.156,This is a key way to reduce transportation emissions.,42,,
242,0.97,1758.156,1766.331,We know our friends at Sdot have partnered to provide more transportation choices for folks so folks don't have to drive.,42,,
243,0.97,1766.331,1771.536,"The more we can offer people choices for Biking, walking, all key transportation and climate solutions.",42,,
244,0.97,1771.536,1777.642,But our office really focuses on coordinating two key transportation climate areas.,42,,
245,0.97,1777.642,1786.551,One is transportation Electrification and the other is equitable congestion pricing.,42,,
246,0.97,1786.551,1792.056,On transportation Electrification we focused on a citywide strategy that looks at scale.,42,,
247,0.97,1792.056,1795.66,Where you can get emission reductions in air pollution benefits yawn just single occupancy vehicles.,42,,
248,0.97,1795.66,1801.432,Looking at how Metro is working to Electrify their buses.,42,,
249,0.97,1801.432,1810.341,Working with the port . working to encourage fleets to Electrify.,42,,
250,0.97,1810.341,1813.444,On of our key strategies there has been leading by example the city's own fleet.,42,,
251,0.97,1813.444,1821.085,We installed over 300 charging stations and moved our passenger sedans toward Ev.,42,,
252,0.97,1821.085,1833.298,"When I say we, I mean the city broadly, we are also really thrilled last year when Spu launched the first all electric trash truck in North America.",42,,
253,0.97,1833.298,1839.671,Really trying to use our purchasing power to move markets.,42,,
254,0.97,1839.671,1845.109,We also partnered with the city of L.A.,42,,
255,0.97,1845.109,1847.512,To combine and reach out to over 30 cities across the U.S.,42,,
256,0.97,1847.512,1864.195,"To aggregate our fleet demands and then approach auto manufacturers together and say, first when you look at Heavy- duty vehicles, folks have not yet developed an electric solution for, we say, if you build it we will buy it.",42,,
257,0.97,1864.195,1865.83,Here is our demand together.,42,,
258,0.97,1865.83,1875.54,"Also for passenger sedans for city fleets, approached autumn Manufactrers together and said will you give us a lower price if you purchase together?",42,,
259,0.97,1875.54,1886.751,"We're trying to use the power of cities recognizing the city of Seattle, we are big, that we can combine forces with other cities to help move the market.",42,,
260,0.97,1886.884,1896.861,"Sorry, I just, it's not a question, so much is something I want to note.",43,,
261,0.97,1896.861,1943.007,"There's going to be hardly anything I would disagree on office would disagree with on in the slides, but the one exception is congestion pricing . I just wanted to note that, and this is something my office is consistently giving feedback to the Mayor's office about this, is that, I don't know, Jessica, it was a committee meeting last year it was Councilmember O'Brien's environmental Committee, I think it was consultants the Mayor had hired, I'm not sure, but it was a very long conversation about congestion pricing.",43,,
262,0.97,1943.007,1967.999,"I continue to be troubled by the fact that these words equitable, continue to be used in connection with congestion pricing even though there is no evidence whatsoever that there is any economic model that it allows congestion pricing to be done Delete.",43,,
263,0.97,1967.999,1970.435,From a statistic standpoint it's not doable.,43,,
264,0.97,1970.435,1973.438,There is no actual examples.,43,,
265,0.97,1973.438,2006.771,"I'm not saying this about ose, but generally this is the feedback we have had for the Mayor's office, I don't pick it's honest to say we are doing something to find equitable approaches would have been no document it will approaches for congestion pricing which by definition is a progressive I would just urge that the departments take that into account and at least say honestly at this point we don't have an equitable approach to doing this.",43,,
266,0.97,2006.771,2007.572,I appreciate that.,44,,
267,0.97,2007.572,2011.776,It was a perfect Segue because I was going to say I know not everyone here AGREES on congestion pricing.,44,,
268,0.97,2011.776,2015.48,We are very much at the beginning of our conversations and work on that.,44,,
269,0.97,2015.48,2032.597,I will say that I take the spirit behind your feedback really seriously and really appreciate it . for us throwing words like Google and sustainable around we see that happen a lot.,44,,
270,0.97,2032.597,2037.268,It is something we take seriously and rubs us the wrong way.,44,,
271,0.97,2037.268,2043.508,So I appreciate that I'm hearing from you that's how that is hitting you.,44,,
272,0.97,2043.508,2054.318,"For us, our approach, and I will say, like I said, we are just at the start of starting to have a civic conversation of is there a model for equitable congestion pricing?",44,,
273,0.97,2054.318,2056.721,All of us will have to have a conversation quite a bit.,44,,
274,0.97,2056.721,2063.261,"The way we look at it, there are only two or three cities around the world have congestion pricing right now.",44,,
275,0.97,2063.261,2069.133,So there is no model for what a truly Equable system looks like.,44,,
276,0.97,2069.133,2073.604,I kind of you that that is where Seattle has always jumped in and created the model or no one else had.,44,,
277,0.97,2073.604,2074.238,Maybe we can't.,44,,
278,0.97,2074.238,2079.11,We are not asking the question Presupposing the answer.,44,,
279,0.97,2079.11,2085.149,So I really look forward to engaging you and all of you and this committee as we move forward.,44,,
280,0.97,2085.149,2085.583,Absolutely.,45,,
281,0.97,2085.583,2094.926,"I wanted you to know, it's not like personal feelings about these phrases.",45,,
282,0.97,2094.926,2100.431,"It's more, what is the accuracy of the information being described here?",45,,
283,0.97,2100.431,2110.775,I don't want her slides coming from the city to be in such a way that someone who wouldn't know about this should not walk away with an idea that there is an equitable model because there isn't.,45,,
284,0.97,2110.775,2112.577,It's an exception to the rule.,45,,
285,0.97,2112.577,2129.727,"As I said I agree with 99.9% of this, just on the congestion pricing, I appreciate what you said, Jessica, about, from my end there is no resistance to Seattle being the first on anything.",45,,
286,0.97,2129.727,2143.274,Were the first major city we passed the moratorium ruling which is the first of its kind in the entire country and the Council has voted that in.,45,,
287,0.97,2143.274,2150.381,"I just want to clarify, my objection to this is not that there isn't an existing model and so we shouldn't be looking into it.",45,,
288,0.97,2150.381,2164.829,My point is merely that from an economic and statistical standpoint it seems to me almost impossible to have--here's what I'm talking about.,45,,
289,0.97,2164.829,2170.835,"If you want to make congestion pricing equitable, you would need income information of every driver the came into a certain zone.",45,,
290,0.97,2170.835,2171.936,How would you do that?,45,,
291,0.97,2171.936,2175.74,For me the statistical barriers seem insurmountable.,45,,
292,0.97,2175.74,2183.514,"It's not so much a political thing, should Seattle be the first?",45,,
293,0.97,2183.514,2186.017,Of course I want Seattle to be the first on many Progressive things.,45,,
294,0.97,2186.017,2186.951,That is not my objection.,45,,
295,0.97,2186.951,2188.152,I just want to clarify.,45,,
296,0.97,2188.152,2194.258,"I was just going to make a point, wasn't there a study on congestion pricing that cannot last spring?",46,,
297,0.97,2194.258,2209.273,"So if we had some finding there, talking about what Councilmember Sawant was sharing about the impacts and that labor wasn't at the table, low income, those are all the things we had to balance and look at.",46,,
298,0.97,2209.273,2211.142,Sdot did do a study on that.,46,,
299,0.97,2211.142,2215.179,That's what they found.,47,,
300,0.97,2215.179,2216.547,What you said.,48,,
301,0.97,2216.547,2221.085,Exactly.,49,,
302,0.97,2221.085,2228.96,"And where I think our next steps are, all the people who worked at the table and were identified, we want to craft a table he hears from everyone and see what we find out.",50,,
303,0.97,2228.96,2239.77,"Exemptions for people who drive for a living, low income, people participate in the Seattle city light.",51,,
304,0.97,2239.77,2240.571,Udp.,51,,
305,0.97,2240.571,2244.008,There were certain ways.,51,,
306,0.97,2244.008,2247.078,I thought we were going to do a pilot program.,51,,
307,0.97,2247.078,2252.717,"I thought that was from Sdot, we would be doing the pilot program at some point.",51,,
308,0.97,2252.717,2254.118,Maybe.,52,,
309,0.97,2254.118,2263.127,"My understanding, for broader congestion pricing is that it would need to go to the vote of the people.",52,,
310,0.97,2263.127,2265.396,Doesn't mean we can't do certain pilots and try certain things.,52,,
311,0.97,2265.396,2290.955,"Again, I don't believe we would start, we are not even at the point to know what that pilot would look like because we really want to our residents, who could be harmed by aggressive tax, what would a pilot look like the could best tell us what should be next and how we should explore this?",52,,
312,0.97,2290.955,2292.957,Were you working with Sdot on the study?,53,,
313,0.97,2292.957,2296.26,We are working with Sdot now.,54,,
314,0.97,2296.26,2300.731,"It's not that we didn't work with them or didn't see the study, we weren't active participants in shaping the study.",54,,
315,0.97,2300.731,2302.533,Through no fault of their own.,54,,
316,0.97,2302.533,2306.337,We worked working on this that much of the time.,54,,
317,0.97,2306.337,2320.751,"I do think it is worth noting at this point that it's not quite just at the beginning, because the city has been talking about this for 1.5 years.",55,,
318,0.97,2320.751,2322.853,And has no Equable model thus far.,55,,
319,0.97,2322.853,2330.361,"Even with all the exceptions that Councilmember Juarez made, it would still be grossly inequitable.",55,,
320,0.97,2330.361,2345.176,"Inking about how much Jeff Bezos would have to pay in a toll in order to have the same percentage of his income, it would be in the millions every time he drove by.",55,,
321,0.97,2345.176,2346.811,That would be quite a congestion model.,55,,
322,0.97,2346.811,2349.814,We don't have any model.,56,,
323,0.97,2349.814,2353.517,"Equitable, inequitable, we don't Hav a model for congestion pricing.",56,,
324,0.97,2353.517,2357.822,We are starting to engage residents on the conversation.,56,,
325,0.97,2357.822,2364.295,Feel free to move ahead.,57,,
326,0.97,2364.295,2367.131,All right.,58,,
327,0.97,2367.131,2369.734,Moving from transportation.,58,,
328,0.97,2369.734,2371.802,We can circle back.,58,,
329,0.97,2371.802,2378.309,To talk about climate justice work which of course all of our work is embedded in that.,58,,
330,0.97,2378.309,2380.144,I will pass it to you.,58,,
331,0.97,2380.144,2380.444,Hello.,59,,
332,0.97,2380.444,2386.617,I will start with the green new deal executive order.,59,,
333,0.97,2386.617,2412.843,"The meat of that directs departments to form an interdepartmental team to advance actions that reduce carbon pollution, invests in Equable transition to clean energy, and Prioritizes to ensure the benefits of investment of clean energy transitions to go to community's historically most impacted by racial, economic and environmental injustice.",59,,
334,0.97,2412.843,2418.883,Of course the RS Ji and environmental agenda will help ground us in this work.,59,,
335,0.97,2418.883,2426.891,I apologize I didn't bring enough for everyone but I thought it might be helpful to have some Agendas.,59,,
336,0.97,2426.891,2444.608,I am glad to bring Whoever doesn't get one the executive order also establishes a fossil fuel ban on new and substantially altered municipal buildings.,59,,
337,0.97,2444.608,2461.192,And ose will work with Department colleagues and Stakeholders to develop carbon pollution indicators and a dashboard to measure and communicate progress in a way that is accessible for not only our colleagues but for Stakeholders in the community as well.,59,,
338,0.97,2461.192,2464.428,There is also the establishment of a youth climate Council.,59,,
339,0.97,2464.428,2474.805,We are in the process of I guess interviewing and appointing folks.,59,,
340,0.97,2474.805,2475.806,There are 15 seats total.,59,,
341,0.97,2475.806,2479.443,Two for current members of the youth Commission.,59,,
342,0.97,2479.443,2486.75,Their charges to provide recommendations on new or existing policies and programs that address climate change.,59,,
343,0.97,2486.75,2503.267,"It will also be working with the existing committees, boards and commissions that look at environmental justice . and the environmental justice committee.",59,,
344,0.97,2503.4,2505.302,Or any of those appointed yet?,60,,
345,0.97,2505.302,2506.47,No.,61,,
346,0.97,2506.47,2507.671,What is the Timeline?,62,,
347,0.97,2507.671,2511.575,Right now they are interviewing folks.,63,,
348,0.97,2511.575,2515.98,I can get back to you on where they are currently and when they hope to have a plan made.,63,,
349,0.97,2515.98,2527.191,I will make a note of that right now.,63,,
350,0.97,2527.191,2529.994,And then the green new deal oversight board.,63,,
351,0.97,2529.994,2534.164,"As you are familiar, there are 19 appointed members.",63,,
352,0.97,2534.164,2542.806,I am looking forward to working with Council and the Mayor's office to collaborate on those appointments.,63,,
353,0.97,2542.806,2547.711,They will work with the city and Stakeholders to advance the green new deal for Seattle.,63,,
354,0.97,2547.711,2560.925,"By proposing policies and programs, making budget and legislative recommendations and also engage with existing committees, boards and commissions looking to advance environmental justice and economic justice within the city.",63,,
355,0.97,2560.925,2563.093,And that process begins--?,64,,
356,0.97,2563.093,2571.835,Council gave us in the budget last year a position on the green new deal starting in April.,65,,
357,0.97,2571.835,2583.047,"Our Timeline if we are able to hire in April, that will be in June",65,,
358,0.97,2583.047,2585.816,All right.,66,,
359,0.97,2585.816,2589.119,Next slide.,66,,
360,0.97,2589.119,2590.921,Can we go back one?,67,,
361,0.97,2590.921,2601.332,"Under the executive order box, it talks about a city team to advance High-Impact actions.",67,,
362,0.97,2601.332,2603.567,Can you give us an example of what that might be?,67,,
363,0.97,2603.567,2615.879,And then I have just a broader question about what you can tell us about any community engagement or outreach for that executive order.,67,,
364,0.97,2615.879,2618.182,Sure.,68,,
365,0.97,2618.182,2623.087,"For the High-Impact actions, two things.",68,,
366,0.97,2623.087,2635.799,"One, the executive order asks us to create a list of the most Impactful climate actions that we could take.",68,,
367,0.97,2635.799,2637.301,So we have to develop that.,68,,
368,0.97,2637.301,2649.48,"We also recognize in the green new deal oversight board legislation the Council past, it asks for the creation of an Idp.",68,,
369,0.97,2649.48,2667.131,A departmental team to work on advancing carbon reduction policies and programs in each Department.,68,,
370,0.97,2667.131,2669.333,"So, we are seeing these as kind of one and the same.",68,,
371,0.97,2669.333,2686.25,We will have a city team or the Idt that will come together and conduct the pieces that the green new deal oversight board ordinance has to do and looks at these High-Impact emissions.,68,,
372,0.97,2686.25,2687.051,If that makes sense.,68,,
373,0.97,2687.051,2689.453,These High-Impact actions.,68,,
374,0.97,2689.453,2696.427,So we will figure out exactly what those actions are and it will continue to move forward with the pieces.,68,,
375,0.97,2696.427,2709.373,"And tried to figure out how, I assume the Idt and oversight board and I know there is an existing criminal justice Committee, and gesturing to figure out how they play together.",69,,
376,0.97,2709.373,2710.974,Actually I had the same question.,70,,
377,0.97,2710.974,2717.781,How the executive order relates to the green new deal and I'm happy to hear also from Yolanda as well.,70,,
378,0.97,2717.781,2734.598,"I will say, and I think I have said this to some of you individually, I will sit here publicly, it keeps me up at night sometimes is knowing that we need to think of a meaningful intentional way for all of these pieces to fit together.",71,,
379,0.97,2734.598,2751.215,"I think Lylianna Allala will talk about our environmental justice committee as part of our Committee, we want to honor that committee of being people of color created, led and driven and workings Pacifically on environmental justice issues.",71,,
380,0.97,2751.215,2758.122,We also want to honor the green new deal oversight board.,71,,
381,0.97,2758.122,2758.722,Youth climate Council.,71,,
382,0.97,2758.722,2759.623,The transportation equity committee.,71,,
383,0.97,2759.623,2766.263,The equitable development advisory committee and the youth Commission that has a environmental justice subcommittee.,71,,
384,0.97,2766.263,2771.502,We understand whether lots of committees and commissions set up.,71,,
385,0.97,2771.502,2779.243,We want to make sure we are Leveraging support so that they are all greater than the sum of their parts and they are not Duplicating efforts.,71,,
386,0.97,2779.243,2785.149,I don't have magic sauce that makes it happened but we are very aware of it.,71,,
387,0.97,2785.149,2787.017,Would you have anything more to that?,71,,
388,0.97,2787.017,2806.47,"I would also add in working with Jessica and crafting the ordinance, establishing the oversight board, we do layout that the Shell could determine what its Workplan is to her point around there being a lot of overlapping interest.",72,,
389,0.97,2806.47,2828.992,"For it to define the grand vision and what it wants to do that year, and as noted, they are engaging with existing bodies and figuring out, the green new deal is a complicated layered thing to try to tackle.",72,,
390,0.97,2828.992,2837.701,"Just acknowledging the planning Commission might be best suited to embrace, even the design Commission.",72,,
391,0.97,2837.701,2854.985,Just having that body thinking more Holistically about that work and maybe more collaborative just acknowledging Interdisciplinary work around the green new deal is.,72,,
392,0.97,2854.985,2857.688,I agree.,73,,
393,0.97,2857.688,2867.231,I think about this in the context of an environmental perspective in each board and Commission has skills and talents they are able to contribute to the initiative.,73,,
394,0.97,2867.231,2872.869,Am really excited to be able to look at this from a collaborative perspective.,73,,
395,0.97,2872.869,2876.94,And not from eight Duplicative standpoint.,73,,
396,0.97,2876.94,2887.117,The next slide is about our equity and environment agenda.,74,,
397,0.97,2887.117,2896.059,"I will just NOTE the initiative was an initiative that started in 2015, that's when the initiative began.",74,,
398,0.97,2896.059,2917.648,"I am really excited to be here at ose as staff because I was part of that initiative from a community standpoint and the agenda was one of the major Deliverables of that . So 2016 the agenda was released, significantly shifted the work of ose.",74,,
399,0.97,2917.648,2923.086,The agenda was a blueprint developed Collaboratively with community to advance environmental justice.,74,,
400,0.97,2923.086,2939.97,"Is very much rooted in the tenants of the Rsji and also acts as an accountability mechanism, I believe, to make sure the city Prioritizes the needs of the city impacted by racial and economic injustice.",74,,
401,0.97,2939.97,2946.743,"As a result of that there were a few recommendations moving forward, one was the creation of the environmental justice committee.",74,,
402,0.97,2946.743,2961.425,"Right now we have 13 members who represent unities of color, they work on program and policy recommendations as well as developing their own ideas that our community led.",74,,
403,0.97,2961.425,2968.799,And ose plays an important role in helping those ideas come to fruition.,74,,
404,0.97,2968.799,2978.141,The principles of open space for communities of color is one of the products that came out of the environmental justice committee.,74,,
405,0.97,2978.141,2982.346,They also worked Collaboratively on a project in partnership with the Ethiopian community center.,74,,
406,0.97,2982.346,3001.264,In this past summer hosted an Expo on traditional ecological knowledge in partnership with the office of civil rights . The other big piece of the agenda is the creation of the environmental justice Fund.,74,,
407,0.97,3001.264,3006.169,This is a priority in terms of investment on community led solutions.,74,,
408,0.97,3006.169,3016.079,"Since 2018, over $1,455,000 has been directed back to community for projects they are leading on.",74,,
409,0.97,3016.079,3039.469,"This is a combination of funds from the environmental justice fund as well as a partnership we have with King conservation district to allocate funds to community led efforts and natural resources, conservation as well as environmental justice project.",74,,
410,0.97,3039.469,3041.605,"Another piece of this is, a commitment to reshaping the narrative.",74,,
411,0.97,3041.605,3044.508,It is no secret that the environmental movement historically has been Overrepresented by white folks.,74,,
412,0.97,3044.508,3059.589,Part of the commitment of ose and the inequity equity and environmental initiative is to Reframe the narrative and bring the historical and central knowledge and contributions from community's of color to the forefront.,74,,
413,0.97,3059.589,3070.734,Part of that is our environmental justice in action series that highlights our leaders on the EJ committee.,74,,
414,0.97,3070.734,3076.039,It has been pretty cool so far to see those profiles come out.,74,,
415,0.97,3076.039,3091.455,"And then of course there is the internal works we are doing is in office and grappling with how we are shifting our processes, our approach to policies, in collaboration with those most impacted by environmental injustice.",74,,
416,0.97,3091.455,3105.268,"And then our last slide, one of our signature projects that has come out of the equity environmental agenda is the program, the creation was a recommendation of the agenda.",74,,
417,0.97,3105.268,3127.39,It's a comprehensive city effort that has taken colleagues across multiple departments to execute in partnership with community and external partners with the intent of better delivering community priorities to the valley.,74,,
418,0.97,3127.39,3130.126,The action plan was released in 2018 and there was a recent update.,74,,
419,0.97,3130.126,3134.297,Is available Online.,74,,
420,0.97,3134.297,3136.766,It has been a joy to see that work come to fruition.,74,,
421,0.97,3136.766,3139.903,I truly believe it's a model for how we can be working across.,74,,
422,0.97,3139.903,3151.181,In your Inbox you will find for me every now and again every time we send an update I also send it to all of you.,75,,
423,0.97,3151.181,3154.818,We are really committed to holding ourselves accountable to what we said we would do in the community.,75,,
424,0.97,3154.818,3168.231,So a few times per year we send a comprehensive update saying this is what we heard you wanted us to do.,75,,
425,0.97,3168.231,3169.299,This is what we have done.,75,,
426,0.97,3169.299,3171.902,This is will be have yet to doing this is what's coming.,75,,
427,0.97,3171.902,3174.738,If you ever see that and have feedback or comments or questions please reach out.,75,,
428,0.97,3174.738,3179.009,"And a few more pieces of her work at ose, many are familiar with the regional food systems work.",75,,
429,0.97,3179.009,3184.114,He started this work in 2013.,75,,
430,0.97,3184.114,3200.13,"Her goals have been to ensure residents have access to healthy local food, that we so sport support local Agriculture and do all we can to prevent food waste.",75,,
431,0.97,3200.13,3205.235,"Similar to how we work on other citywide issues, we really work to convene, coordinate, collaborate, city departments with other regional and national partners.",75,,
432,0.97,3205.235,3216.58,Over the last few years we have really grown our food justice work thanks to the sweetened beverage tax and the success of our fresh program the many of you are familiar with.,75,,
433,0.97,3216.58,3225.689,Fresh bucks started as a program that provided a match to snap at farmers markets.,75,,
434,0.97,3225.689,3238.702,"With the success of that program, the expansion in support of the sweetened beverage tax we have been able to expand that program in significant ways.",75,,
435,0.97,3238.702,3241.071,First it's eligible to folks beyond just who is eligible for snap.,75,,
436,0.97,3241.071,3249.079,And folks who have an income of up to 80% of area median income are now eligible for fresh bucks.,75,,
437,0.97,3249.079,3259.289,"We see as our Federal Government makes it harder and harder to achieve food assistance, we are trying to fill a gap in all ways we can to provide more benefits for folks.",75,,
438,0.97,3259.289,3273.036,"We also, where this program started, was a program it's farmers market that they can use the fresh bucks at any Safeway stores in Seattle and the number of neighborhood grocers.",75,,
439,0.97,3273.036,3274.337,We are excited about the program.,75,,
440,0.97,3274.337,3282.812,We expanded it dramatically between 2018 and 2019 and that we are set to Triplett this year so we will serve 7500 people.,75,,
441,0.97,3282.812,3304.968,"I don't want to forget to mention the success of fresh bucks has largely been, our staff is amazing, but the community partners we have enlisted, beyond justice group, these are the community Realizations that have been out enrolling constituencies into fresh bucks.",75,,
442,0.97,3304.968,3314.277,I really want to thank them for all they have done to make this program successful and make sure it's going to the people who need it the most.,75,,
443,0.97,3314.277,3315.879,I know there's a question.,75,,
444,0.97,3315.879,3318.982,Councilmember Juarez and then Councilmember Morales.,76,,
445,0.97,3318.982,3325.255,Is at ose that staffs the community advisory board for the --,77,,
446,0.97,3325.255,3325.889,Yes.,78,,

449,0.97,3330.76,3331.895,Is it 15?,79,,
450,0.97,3331.895,3333.596,15-Ish.,80,,
451,0.97,3333.596,3336.599,Do we have seats coming up?,81,,
452,0.97,3336.599,3341.705,"Yes, there are a few vacancies.",82,,
453,0.97,3341.705,3343.106,We need to talk more about this.,82,,
454,0.97,3343.106,3349.879,"I think there were some questions about the committee, --",82,,
455,0.97,3349.879,3354.718,Can I get a list and then what vacancies are coming up?,83,,
456,0.97,3354.718,3378.074,"I know that some of us, not to talk about feelings, I know we had some balance, we wanted balance on the board between those that were professional U- Dub people, nothing wrong with that, but also people running food banks, food insecurity.",83,,
457,0.97,3378.074,3379.909,I can remember with the balance was before.,83,,
458,0.97,3379.909,3382.679,I know we had some issues and I thought we might've Recalibrated that board?,83,,
459,0.97,3382.679,3392.856,"I would like to see that before budget because that's going to come up again about how much revenue we have gotten, what the priorities are and what the ordinance actually says.",83,,
460,0.97,3392.856,3403.867,"The second part is on the Seattle public schools, can you give us a list of the 19 elementary and high schools receiving this?",83,,
461,0.97,3403.867,3404.868,That would be helpful.,83,,
462,0.97,3404.868,3417.48,"We have gotten a lot of questions, I think in your district, they are not actual food deserts because that is where you don't have a grocery store for miles, the first city it's relative to something a food desert.",83,,
463,0.97,3417.48,3429.659,"I know because we know are low income housing, the point is we don't have a grocery store.",83,,
464,0.97,3429.659,3430.894,That's been an issue for years.,83,,
465,0.97,3430.894,3436.8,"We want to Revisit that, Councilmember Pedersen and I, looking at the deed and lease on the property.",83,,
466,0.97,3436.8,3445.875,One thing we were looking at is getting the buy in and help from this board to work with us on the food insecurity piece.,83,,
467,0.97,3445.875,3451.014,We have three buildings?,84,,
468,0.97,3451.014,3453.416,There are 1000 low income residents.,85,,
469,0.97,3453.416,3459.322,The has grown in the last three years.,86,,
470,0.97,3459.322,3465.829,"Again, we work together because I chair parks so I hear about what goes on in Councilmember Pedersen's district.",87,,
471,0.97,3465.829,3480.443,"We also work with Council member Johnson, now that we have someone more permanent I hope we can begin.",87,,
472,0.97,3480.443,3483.246,If you can give us a list of schools that would be helpful.,87,,
473,0.97,3483.246,3484.314,We can do that.,88,,
474,0.97,3484.314,3488.751,We want to do is service many residents who are food insecure as possible in as innovative ways as possible.,88,,
475,0.97,3488.751,3495.458,We are always keen to partner and help and work with the other departments and agencies who also provide food services.,88,,
476,0.97,3495.592,3515.979,"More of a note, my struggle or concern with ose and the fresh bucks program has always been, and I don't know if it will continue to be, we don't have in my district a market that is around 12 months out of the year.",89,,
477,0.97,3515.979,3521.284,Who has a market?,89,,
478,0.97,3521.284,3525.288,Just University district and Ballard.,90,,
479,0.97,3525.288,3533.162,We know now where the poverty levels are at least in my district.,90,,
480,0.97,3533.162,3543.606,"My concern has always been, and we struggled with this with the fresh bucks people in the farmers market people, they are not the type of food that needs to be there so we are actually providing food for low income people.",90,,
481,0.97,3543.606,3557.82,"Because what we do see at the farmers market, and I don't see a lot of families using fresh bucks there, to buy designer cheese and Ale.",90,,
482,0.97,3557.82,3563.326,I'm just not seeing that and it's driving me crazy.,90,,
483,0.97,3563.326,3565.828,It concerns me.,90,,
484,0.97,3565.828,3569.632,Particularly because we have two huge housing complexes.,90,,
485,0.97,3569.632,3585.448,"We had a meeting and one of the things, I will say because I know Councilmember Sawant will understand what I'm saying, someone made the comment that these low income people aren't using the market and maybe we should teach them how to shop.",90,,
486,0.97,3585.448,3587.717,That is not what we are doing.,90,,
487,0.97,3587.717,3593.756,People not to buy their food.,90,,
488,0.97,3593.756,3596.225,If their food is there they know how to come by it.,90,,
489,0.97,3596.225,3597.26,Not everyone likes kale.,90,,
490,0.97,3597.26,3598.261,Accessible and affordable.,91,,
491,0.97,3598.261,3599.062,I completely agree.,91,,
492,0.97,3599.062,3605.335,You not going to have a family of four come with their benefits to buy kale.,92,,
493,0.97,3605.335,3630.793,"To your point Councilmember Juarez, to buttress your point, when I was teaching at Seattle University one of my colleagues, I believe he is still doing it, a Statistics professor, she does this kind of project with her 101 students where they look at the prices of organic produce and they compare them.",93,,
494,0.97,3630.793,3639.102,You know who consistently comes out ahead the Co-op.,93,,
495,0.97,3639.102,3653.816,"On the one hand we want to support local businesses, local produce and all of that, but at the end of the day, the larger more fundamentally important question is are low income families able to afford the food around them?",93,,
496,0.97,3653.816,3666.529,"And to your point, Councilmember, if the food is not affordable and mostly artisan or designer then it is not accessible.",93,,
497,0.97,3666.529,3672.001,Was a point of giving the money if they're not coming there to buy all the stuff.,94,,
498,0.97,3672.001,3680.543,"It isn't about the people needing to be taught how to shop, I found offensive and that is another issue.",94,,
499,0.97,3680.543,3681.544,I'm sorry I interrupted.,94,,
500,0.97,3681.544,3683.146,I helped write the food action plan.,95,,
501,0.97,3683.146,3688.851,I want to thank you for continuing to implement it.,95,,
502,0.97,3688.851,3703.733,"As someone who has worked in food systems for 10 years or so more, I would love to talk with you about what you are trying to do and in defense of farmers, I have to say the farmers charge what it cost for them to produce high-quality Produe.",95,,
503,0.97,3703.733,3708.771,The issue here isn't the farmers should charge less.,95,,
504,0.97,3708.771,3718.481,The issue is that our families need to be making higher wages.,95,,
505,0.97,3718.481,3725.388,"The struggle I have with the way we talk about the if urgency food system is that it's always been intended to be an emergency, not a normal way for people to access food.",95,,
506,0.97,3725.388,3738.801,And if we really want to solve the issue of hunger and food insecurity we need to do is look up stream and make sure people have higher wage jobs.,95,,
507,0.97,3738.801,3739.902,Hunger is an income issue.,95,,
508,0.97,3739.902,3750.213,"That said because we struggled to be able to do that, we have entitlement programs like food stamps and fresh bucks and we need to make sure that folks are able to use those programs as much as possible.",95,,
509,0.97,3750.213,3765.228,"I appreciate what you are doing and I think that when we have these kind of opportunities to give people double the access of what their food stamps might by, those are definitely ways, things we need to leverage.",95,,
510,0.97,3765.228,3774.337,We also need to look at increasing people's registration to use these programs they are entitled to.,95,,
511,0.97,3774.337,3776.639,People don't realize they are eligible for these programs.,95,,
512,0.97,3776.639,3781.811,That is another issue.,95,,
513,0.97,3781.811,3785.148,There was another point I wanted to make.,95,,
514,0.97,3785.148,3787.15,Which I won't remember.,95,,
515,0.97,3787.15,3792.588,", I just want to say there was a slight up that shows the organizations participating.",95,,
516,0.97,3792.588,3805.234,I didn't see them on it this year but a coalition did participate with the farmers market that we had.,95,,
517,0.97,3805.234,3806.202,At the Ethiopian community center.,95,,
518,0.97,3806.202,3810.573,I know that was a really important opportunity for people in the community to access fresh food.,95,,
519,0.97,3810.573,3825.588,"And I would love to talk with you all about the issue with the farmer markets, every community once when but it's really hard on farmers to spread throughout communities.",95,,
520,0.97,3825.588,3832.662,So other ways we can work to find culturally appropriate affordable food for people are things we definitely need to Prioritize.,95,,
521,0.97,3832.662,3833.596,Thank you.,95,,
522,0.97,3833.596,3840.169,"I just wanted to say, I totally agree with you about living wage jobs.",96,,
523,0.97,3840.169,3865.394,"I think it also goes to the question of, overall, having lower incomes and then on top of that, what chunk of that goes into paying your rent and the big ticket items and how much is left over . I really appreciate you bringing in the point that we are talking about access and afford ability of good, quality food.",96,,
524,0.97,3865.394,3872.702,"And also the question of the overall standards of living which is related to the housing crisis, affordable housing crisis in our city.",96,,
525,0.97,3872.702,3884.914,And how much money is left over for households with the combination of the rent they have to pay and the fact that many people are stuck in jobs that don't pay them anywhere close to enough.,96,,
526,0.97,3884.914,3889.352,I want to acknowledge the hard balance we have to make.,97,,
527,0.97,3889.352,3901.13,"The point of these programs, the point of the food action plan originally was to create a vibrant regional food economy and that means we are supporting our regions farmers.",97,,
528,0.97,3901.13,3903.766,And understand they have to make a living as well.,97,,
529,0.97,3903.766,3913.476,So we can't solve this problem on the backs of our farmers.,97,,
530,0.97,3913.476,3915.845,We should not be putting small farmers against the households.,98,,
531,0.97,3915.845,3919.215,"I think the other point you made, extremely well taken, these programs are emergency programs.",98,,
532,0.97,3919.215,3923.052,They are corrective programs.,98,,
533,0.97,3923.052,3928.157,Really the focus should be on correcting the system on the other end.,98,,
534,0.97,3928.157,3928.958,Thank you.,99,,
535,0.97,3928.958,3931.394,I very much appreciate the entire discussion.,99,,
536,0.97,3931.394,3959.422,"And will also say, Councilmember Juarez, we would love to talk . is precisely the spirit, it's not up to us to tell our residents of lower incomes how or where they should shop and that is how we have tried to approach fresh bucks and that's how they are able to use the vouchers Interchangeably at Safeway or farmers markets.",99,,
537,0.97,3959.422,3965.728,We have tried to respond to the feedback that farmers markets alone weren't enough.,99,,
538,0.97,3965.728,3972.435,We are very passionate about this work so we are keen and excited to talk anytime.,99,,
539,0.97,3972.435,3979.141,The last piece of work I will mention ose focuses on urban forestry efforts.,99,,
540,0.97,3979.141,3981.711,Which I think many of you are familiar with.,99,,
541,0.97,3981.711,3987.85,Another effort where we play it convening role.,99,,
542,0.97,3987.85,4010.84,There eight city departments that work on orphan forestry and urban forestry and ose just make sure we are providing appropriate customer service to residents who care about treason issues related to trees but don't know if they should call parks ore city light that we are coming together to talk to them.,99,,
543,0.97,4010.84,4014.477,We staff the urban forestry Commission.,99,,
544,0.97,4014.477,4016.679,You will hear from them and us.,99,,
545,0.97,4016.679,4022.551,You can see here on this graphic that every few years we measure the canopy.,99,,
546,0.97,4022.551,4029.792,The citywide canopy cover was 28% which is close to our thirty percent goal.,99,,
547,0.97,4029.792,4031.293,We need to pay attention to that.,99,,
548,0.97,4031.293,4049.812,"We found that is a data point to show us what we already know, the lived experience Seattleites which access to trees and the benefits they provide is an environmental justice issue.",99,,
549,0.97,4049.812,4061.424,"Have partnered with community groups including a really great project with the Duwamish Valley you score to do targeted planting, Treeplanting to see how we can increase canopy cover.",99,,
550,0.97,4061.424,4066.295,We are currently updating the urban forestry management plans.,99,,
551,0.97,4066.295,4082.812,We know that the Land-Use committee has been focusing on trees so we will probably be here on the tree issue less but it's something that ose works on and we are happy to talk with you about.,99,,
552,0.97,4082.812,4089.418,Thank you for talking about trees.,100,,
553,0.97,4089.418,4102.231,"The 2016 canopy coverage, 28%, I imagine when they do a new study we will see an increase--decrease because Anecdotally we have heard about trees being torn out throughout the city, especially in the South end . It is an equity issue.",100,,
554,0.97,4102.231,4104.266,Think you for raising that.,100,,
555,0.97,4104.266,4129.592,In fact we may end up seeing with the Nutri ordinance is we want ose to take a greater role in oversight because right now we have the Seattle Department of construction and inspections as a main regulator of that which could be problematic as real estate developers are more inclined to want to take out trees rather than keep them.,100,,
556,0.97,4129.592,4138.567,"The ose will take a better role in oversight, we will see how that plays out with the city council.",100,,
557,0.97,4138.567,4140.803,We are quite happy to talk to about that anytime.,101,,
558,0.97,4140.803,4147.71,We appreciate folks wanting ose to engage.,101,,
559,0.97,4147.71,4148.11,We always do.,101,,
560,0.97,4148.11,4153.415,I would also be Remiss if I didn't say we partner close with Sdci and feel confident in the services they offer.,101,,
561,0.97,4153.415,4162.324,But we are really happy to keep talking about that and see what makes the most sense and how folks want to move forward.,101,,
562,0.97,4162.324,4164.193,Thank you.,102,,
563,0.97,4164.193,4165.227,Thank you.,103,,
564,0.97,4165.227,4174.136,The last slide is just letting you all know a few things we will certainly be bringing over to this Committee this year.,104,,
565,0.97,4174.136,4183.045,"I mentioned we have a few pieces on the oil conversion work, that is an update on our implementation plan.",104,,
566,0.97,4183.045,4185.915,We will be coming annually with a report on how it's working.,104,,
567,0.97,4185.915,4193.622,And the high road contracting standards associated with the oil conversion work.,104,,
568,0.97,4193.622,4205.834,"In the green new deal oversight board ordinance, that you all passed last year, there is a requirement for each Department to report annually on the climate actions.",104,,
569,0.97,4205.834,4219.882,"From talking to Council member O'Brien, I believe the intention was for departmental leadership to communicate directly with you on that and again not go through the filter of ose.",104,,
570,0.97,4219.882,4222.284,We will partner and help you get what you need on that.,104,,
571,0.97,4222.284,4225.087,The annually report on the equity and environment initiative.,104,,
572,0.97,4225.087,4236.999,Typically do that as part of our annual are Sj presentation to Council.,104,,
573,0.97,4236.999,4239.535,That is how we have been doing that annual presentation.,104,,
574,0.97,4239.535,4253.716,Also when the building Tuneups law passed in 2016 there was a resolution asking us to report back to Council at the end of this year about how it's going and how effective that ordinance has been.,104,,
575,0.97,4253.716,4254.783,We will be preparing that.,104,,
576,0.97,4254.783,4260.623,Of course NOTE you're working on updating our food action plan.,104,,
577,0.97,4260.623,4269.999,We intend to bring it to the committee next year.,104,,
578,0.97,4269.999,4283.612,"And a quick note, the tree canopy that is something that our office is participating in.",104,,
579,0.97,4283.612,4293.922,And that is ose.,104,,
580,0.97,4294.823,4296.058,I appreciate the questions.,105,,
581,0.97,4296.058,4297.226,Any questions?,106,,
582,0.97,4297.226,4299.662,Thank you for giving us a line of what's coming up.,106,,
583,0.97,4299.662,4301.997,That is helpful to know what reports.,107,,
584,0.97,4301.997,4303.065,Thank you.,107,,
585,0.97,4303.065,4314.476,"And Council members, if you have any suggestions on appointments for the green new deal oversight board, please send them to my office.",108,,
586,0.97,4314.476,4317.479,We will start looking at them.,108,,
