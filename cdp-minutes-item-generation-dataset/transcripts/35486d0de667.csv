30,0.97,150.416,155.355,We know that our business community has been devastated.,6,,
31,0.97,155.355,187.921,"Particularly those that are the restaurants and bars and music Venue and tourism industry and the retail space, as they struggled through last year we know the workers have been in harm's way as they navigate mask rules and deal with customers that may be resistant or lax in maintaining the social distancing.",6,,

42,0.97,251.985,270.637,We don't want to bring Seattle back the same as it was because we weren't as equitable as we know we can be and our recovery effort aims to build a thriving city as we implement strategies and meet the needs of our neighborhoods and communities.,8,,
43,0.97,270.637,274.941,So we have divided it up Untwo buckets.,8,,

68,0.97,506.272,517.617,We want to foster innovation and the creative industries and culture and retail because we know what Covid has exposed is that there is going to be a different way that people work.,12,,

153,0.97,1211.076,1226.291,First and second floor to have space that can be an Incubator for small business development because we have lost 40% of African-American businesses across the country and providing opportunities for that.,16,,

166,0.97,1363.729,1364.696,I can't hear you.,20,,
167,0.97,1364.696,1367.299,You went off.,20,,
168,0.97,1367.299,1367.966,I can't hear you.,20,,
169,0.97,1367.966,1370.736,Councilmember Morales froze to my screen.,21,,
170,0.97,1370.736,1372.738,Frozen on our screen.,22,,
171,0.97,1372.738,1374.606,She is frozen on all of our screens.,23,,
172,0.97,1374.606,1386.251,Let's give her a second and see if she can get back on.,24,,
173,0.97,1389.955,1397.729,She is having issues.,24,,
174,0.97,1397.729,1400.565,Is she back?,25,,
175,0.97,1400.565,1404.736,"We thank you, chairman Morales.",26,,
176,0.97,1404.736,1405.57,They are all listening.,26,,
177,0.97,1405.57,1408.173,Thank you so much.,27,,
178,0.97,1408.173,1411.543,Thank you for during that couple member Juarez.,28,,
179,0.97,1411.543,1416.348,That is a great idea and I appreciate the partnership and reaching out.,28,,
180,0.97,1416.348,1423.688,My phone is blowing up and others are saying why didn't you say our name?,29,,
181,0.97,1423.688,1432.497,I'm only doing tribal leadership.,29,,
182,0.97,1432.497,1433.298,Not my Cousin.,29,,
183,0.97,1433.298,1433.965,Not my sister-in-law.,29,,
184,0.97,1433.965,1448.88,Do you have anything to add as far as work plans for Oed moving forward around Covid?,30,,
185,0.97,1448.88,1450.115,I want to reserve that.,30,,
186,0.97,1450.115,1451.016,We can take other questions.,30,,
187,0.97,1451.016,1459.591,I do have a response to the most recent.,30,,
188,0.97,1459.591,1460.158,Thank you.,31,,
189,0.97,1460.158,1469.1,Internet is really shaky today.,32,,
190,0.97,1469.1,1489.454,Councilmember Morales says they are remodeling her house and she moved closer to the Internet and it was echoing because they took furniture on.,33,,
191,0.97,1489.454,1491.523,Is Councilmember Lewis on?,34,,
192,0.97,1491.523,1496.862,Can you hear me?,35,,
193,0.97,1496.862,1497.496,Hello.,36,,
194,0.97,1497.496,1500.131,We can hear you it looks like he hung up.,37,,
195,0.97,1500.131,1503.568,I might have to step up.,38,,
196,0.97,1503.568,1504.669,I am not the vice chair.,38,,
197,0.97,1504.669,1509.474,Can you guys hear me?,39,,
198,0.97,1509.474,1510.942,Hello.,39,,
199,0.97,1510.942,1512.744,We can hear you Councilmember Lewis.,40,,
200,0.97,1512.744,1513.478,Thank you.,41,,
201,0.97,1513.478,1513.712,Sorry.,41,,
202,0.97,1513.712,1523.388,I guess for some reason I was muted.,41,,
203,0.97,1523.388,1534.099,Are we not having chairman Morales back soon?,41,,
204,0.97,1534.099,1535.2,Is she in communication with I.,41,,
205,0.97,1535.2,1539.938,T. is she working to get back on?,41,,
206,0.97,1539.938,1543.375,We don't know her situation.,42,,
207,0.97,1543.375,1546.411,We know she dropped off.,42,,
208,0.97,1546.411,1548.513,Okay.,43,,
209,0.97,1548.513,1567.599,I think at this point unless there is other questions for other Councilmembers for interim director banks we can ask questions in the chair's absence and can resume her line of questioning when she comes back.,43,,
210,0.97,1567.599,1569.567,This is Councilmember Pederson.,44,,
211,0.97,1569.567,1570.635,I have a question for director banks.,44,,
212,0.97,1570.635,1579.611,Councilmember Pederson you you recognized.,45,,
213,0.97,1579.611,1596.461,A lot of us are on the phone and we are very familiar with th many business districts we have.,46,,
214,0.97,1596.461,1624.99,Downtown though has such a large proportion of jobs and supports a tax base in a strong way and so it does have a major impact on the rest of the city when downtown needs to be revitalized recover quickly to provide that tax base and provide the programs that we want to provide to those most vulnerable in the city.,46,,
215,0.97,1624.99,1632.097,I'm interested in seeing the economic engine restarting.,46,,
216,0.97,1632.097,1654.252,One of my concerns is that businesses will not necessarily resign the commercial leases in downtown office space because the Covid pandemic have enabled businesses to have employees work remotely.,46,,
217,0.97,1654.252,1670.935,I'm concerned about them relocating to lower rent areas in Puget sound and removing them from the tax base and we need that tax base to support the programs that serve the most vulnerable residents.,46,,
218,0.97,1670.935,1680.445,You don't have to answer today but I'm interested in knowing the data on whether businesses are resigning commercial leases downtown.,46,,
219,0.97,1680.445,1681.312,Councilmember Pederson.,47,,
220,0.97,1681.312,1704.102,Thank you for that question and that came out in the external stake holder meeting and Rachel Smith from the Chamber have been in discussing and they will have data in about three week to address that and give us more information around that.,47,,
221,0.97,1704.102,1705.703,Thank you director banks.,48,,
222,0.97,1705.703,1737.902,What we see from them I would support us independently getting the information as well whether we hire a survey firm methodically from employers that employ the most people and happy to support that upcoming budget discussion.,48,,
223,0.97,1737.902,1756.821,"It would be a good investment to hire a survey firm to ask the businesses are you going to renew your lease, if so, why, if not why not and what do we need to lean into the office of economic development to retain those businesses and attract new ones.",48,,
224,0.97,1756.821,1766.464,I'm sorry to have the city and county do that as well because we are major employers too.,49,,
225,0.97,1766.464,1771.202,"When we come back, are we coming back 30 or 40 or 50%.",49,,
226,0.97,1771.202,1783.348,A lead by example is a cool idea around that idea as well because we are a major employer as well.,49,,
227,0.97,1783.348,1785.884,Thank you for that.,49,,
228,0.97,1785.884,1792.457,This is Councilmember Morales.,50,,
229,0.97,1792.457,1795.36,Another example of my terrible Internet connection.,50,,
230,0.97,1795.36,1796.961,So interim director banks I do have a couple more questions.,50,,
231,0.97,1796.961,1801.599,I know you are trying to go but I would like to go back to slide four.,50,,
232,0.97,1801.599,1802.867,I was trying to do that before.,50,,
233,0.97,1802.867,1813.878,I will have to stay on the phone to do the rest of the meeting to be safe.,50,,
234,0.97,1813.878,1817.081,So you identified different revenue sources.,50,,
235,0.97,1817.081,1826.457,The jump start spending plan for youth of the payroll revenues in 2022 and beyond does include resources specifically for economic revitalization.,50,,
236,0.97,1826.457,1832.363,But there is no reference to that as a potential source.,50,,
237,0.97,1832.363,1834.432,To support that here.,50,,
238,0.97,1834.432,1841.406,Is that something you are supporting somewhere else?,50,,
239,0.97,1841.406,1844.108,Good afternoon.,51,,
240,0.97,1844.108,1846.311,This is Mayor Washington.,51,,
241,0.97,1846.311,1866.164,We are working through that progresses the budget office and when that information is available it will be added to future presentations but not there at this time.,51,,
242,0.97,1866.164,1866.431,Okay.,52,,
243,0.97,1866.431,1867.966,Thank you deputy Mayor.,52,,
244,0.97,1867.966,1884.682,"Colleagues if you have a question, please, let's do like King County Council say your last name and I will be happy to recognize you since I can't see right now.",52,,
245,0.97,1884.682,1884.883,Okay.,52,,
246,0.97,1884.883,1889.754,So I will move on then to the next slide.,52,,
247,0.97,1889.754,1895.093,There was a report on the racial gap that is increasing in the city.,52,,
248,0.97,1895.093,1907.005,And one of the take Aways for me is that the systemic policies that are not focusing on people is sort of what is leading to the needs to repair the harm.,52,,
249,0.97,1907.005,1925.69,I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about some policy examples of intentional community investments and strategies that would have the adult in achieving that kind of inclusive resilient economy.,52,,
250,0.97,1925.69,1930.495,I will take this one again director banks and you can jump in if you would like to.,53,,
251,0.97,1930.495,1936.2,Thank you for bringing the community resilience part back into the conversation.,53,,
252,0.97,1936.2,1951.582,As a reminder we did not forget it but focusing on downtown recovery but as director banks said there is economic recovery and community resilience and Rebelieve it takes both of those to recover economically.,53,,
253,0.97,1951.582,1966.364,Some examples that we could do that we are doing is working with the school district to ensure that students have educational justice and have access to laptops and that they are connected.,53,,
254,0.97,1966.364,1971.636,Seattlepublic schools track how many young people actually log on.,53,,
255,0.97,1971.636,1979.077,If there are young people not logging on Partnering with the school district to figure out what is happening with those young people.,53,,
256,0.97,1979.077,1986.351,That is one example of the near term.,53,,
257,0.97,1986.351,1988.453,Immediate strategies that don't remember widespread vaccination.,53,,
258,0.97,1988.453,1992.323,Another is food vouchers that we are Provideing to families through Hsd.,53,,
259,0.97,1992.323,2009.54,I want to back up and say the reason we don't have solutions ready and up for downtown recovery so we ensure the so solutions come from that work.,53,,
260,0.97,2009.54,2017.281,"Often time we show up and we have the answers and the work group wants to know why there is a work group if we solved everything, why do we need them?",53,,
261,0.97,2017.281,2029.293,There will be a point in the near future that there will be tangible Examplesof action that we will take to revitalize downtown.,53,,
262,0.97,2029.293,2029.761,I wanted to say that.,53,,
263,0.97,2029.761,2061.459,"In addition we are working with the small business advisory council as long as the local bias to look at data and say how are neighborhoods impacted and what are the community and neighborhoods that are impacted the hardest and that will be looking at race Ethnicity to just--because all things aren't equal and once those--I have said to them, I think it is wise to choose five neighborhoods this year.",53,,
264,0.97,2061.459,2066.931,We can do another five next year.,53,,
265,0.97,2066.931,2068.299,Once we recognize those neighborhoods.,53,,
266,0.97,2068.299,2071.536,I'm sure Capitol Hill will be on that list.,53,,
267,0.97,2071.536,2080.878,The local bias and members from that community will work together on a set of recommendations on how to revitalize that mobile neighborhood.,53,,
268,0.97,2080.878,2082.48,I believe Councilmember Morales.,53,,
269,0.97,2082.48,2097.628,You are trying to get at the equitable part and recovery and I just wanted to give two examples of how the work that director banks is addressing is addressing race.,53,,
270,0.97,2097.628,2102.066,I will give one more.,53,,
271,0.97,2102.066,2119.317,"The strategic land acquisition work that Ocpd, office of civil rights, I think Oed is on that group working with the community group around strategic land acquisition.",53,,
272,0.97,2119.317,2124.088,As you know the Mayor's equitable task force is working on 30 million.,53,,
273,0.97,2124.088,2138.669,We also included Participatory budgeting in the community resilience bucket so the whole 100 million is in that bucket because the intention of all of that money on both the executive side and Council side was to address racial inequity.,53,,
274,0.97,2138.669,2140.104,Those are some examples.,53,,
275,0.97,2140.104,2145.81,I can give more and answer additional questions.,53,,
276,0.97,2145.81,2146.377,I appreciate that.,54,,
277,0.97,2146.377,2153.551,I am definitely interested to know more about the Participatory budget almost there and we can follow up on that.,54,,
278,0.97,2153.551,2161.792,It does raise a couple of other questions for me about the list of issues.,54,,
279,0.97,2161.792,2187.518,"It is like seven list of issues and I am curious if the list is the same or downtown and neighborhood businesses and if there is some sort of noticeable difference in the concerns or what they are advocating for, and how you got that information, if it was a survey or how that list was generated.",54,,
280,0.97,2187.518,2189.754,That is one question.,54,,
281,0.97,2189.754,2197.862,Another question is about the work group itself.,54,,
282,0.97,2197.862,2206.404,"You've mentioned bias and different business districts, if you could talk about who was invited to participate and are the meetings opened to the public.",54,,
283,0.97,2206.404,2214.512,What kind of strategies that you consider there for downtown versus neighborhood districts.,54,,
284,0.97,2214.512,2216.547,So those are two general questions I have.,54,,
285,0.97,2216.547,2227.291,I will answer the first question and then I will let director banks answer how she got the information on the slide.,55,,
286,0.97,2227.291,2229.794,This is downtown revitalization focus.,55,,
287,0.97,2229.794,2232.296,We kind of--what Councilmember Pederson was recommending.,55,,
288,0.97,2232.296,2248.512,We need to hear from local--we need to ask the folks whether it is downtown or Capitol Hill or Columbia city or Rainer Beach what they feel are the barriers to revitalize their local community.,55,,
289,0.97,2248.512,2273.404,We are doing that through the Bia and small business advisory Council in neighborhoods and doing it downtown Seattle through the external working group and would love to have an idea of doing a survey to get more people--people are more willing to answer questions if it is anonymous survey than being asked by folks.,55,,
290,0.97,2273.404,2298.262,So that is--the distinction before I pass it over to director banks is downtown revitalization is being worked on by a group who work downtown and employ folks doubt or provide services downtown.,55,,
291,0.97,2298.262,2319.05,The community resilience in terms of neighborhoods in the community is being worked on in a variety of ways and one through the bias and the Mayor equitable task force and the other way through the Participatory process and another way is through the 12 million that hid put out in Reimagining community safety.,55,,
292,0.97,2319.05,2334.465,"So what we have right now in all neighborhoods across Seattle is multiple streams of community whether it is the black variance project, community safety.",55,,
293,0.97,2334.465,2356.587,"We are asking communities what do you need and then focusing those dollars to invest in what the community says that they need and so director Bank, if you want to talk about who told you these things on the slide and how you gathered that information.",55,,
294,0.97,2356.587,2357.922,Correct.,56,,
295,0.97,2357.922,2369.233,"So first off, I personally probably have talked to, I am going to say between 75 and one hundred people that live or work or play downtown.",56,,
296,0.97,2369.233,2387.952,"Michael wells, small business advocate, he spoke to over 300 different people and then John schools talked to several people.",56,,
297,0.97,2387.952,2391.756,This is Stakeholders admittedly anecdotal this was the theme that came out of the conversations we had.,56,,
298,0.97,2391.756,2406.737,I would like to do a survey that Councilmember Pederson suggested as well and with what deputy Mayor Washington just said.,56,,
299,0.97,2406.737,2428.092,"Today in our external stake holder group we had, you know, a presentation from the Mayor's office on public safety and homelessness because those are two of the big issues that downtown Stakeholders are saying we must address before we can start talking about bringing workers back and activation and such.",56,,
300,0.97,2428.092,2440.838,"The working group comprises the representatives of business, cultural community and service organizations that reflect the diverse interest of downtown.",56,,
301,0.97,2440.838,2449.113,We have--reached out intentionally to the groups as far as trying to cover any group that is down there.,56,,
302,0.97,2449.113,2451.081,You know downtown has residence Association.,56,,
303,0.97,2451.081,2451.982,We have labor unions.,56,,
304,0.97,2451.982,2453.017,We have large business.,56,,
305,0.97,2453.017,2457.188,We have small business.,56,,
306,0.97,2457.188,2458.889,We have retail covered.,56,,
307,0.97,2458.889,2472.303,And it was just really diverse group that we put together and actually literally at home speaking about who would be good to bring together and you know Vetted the group around.,56,,
308,0.97,2472.303,2474.905,So it wasn't like picking or choosing.,56,,
309,0.97,2474.905,2483.28,It was just trying to find the most diverse folks that we can and having the neighborhood representatives was crucial.,56,,
310,0.97,2483.28,2508.572,We had the PDA on there and the Pinier square alliance and having representatives from each of the seven neighborhoods as well as business organizations and Nonprofits and cultural institutions and labor that all Conversed down there but that is how the group was chosen.,56,,
311,0.97,2508.572,2515.646,"So I'll stop one more time, colleagues.",57,,
312,0.97,2515.646,2516.213,There's anymore questions?,57,,
313,0.97,2516.213,2516.48,Okay.,57,,
314,0.97,2516.48,2546.911,I guess I want to go to slide ten then and it sort of relates back to what both of you were talking about which is this list is a list of people to talk to but it seems to me that Department has been working closely especially in the last year as they talk to folks about the small business Utilizization Fund.,57,,
315,0.97,2546.911,2555.219,It seems there are strategies and concerns identified already in different neighborhoods.,57,,
316,0.97,2555.219,2558.022,Is that not the case?,57,,
317,0.97,2558.022,2564.762,"I would say not cohesively, yes.",58,,
318,0.97,2564.762,2566.297,Sorry.,59,,
319,0.97,2566.297,2566.764,Go ahead.,60,,
320,0.97,2566.764,2573.437,This is the economic--what I have learned from today we have to explain how the two fit together.,61,,
321,0.97,2573.437,2573.804,Absolutely.,62,,
322,0.97,2573.804,2574.104,Yes.,63,,
323,0.97,2574.104,2579.41,There is rich information from communities on what they need.,63,,
324,0.97,2579.41,2602.967,But what has been missing in all of the data that I believe outside of downtown Seattle is what do the small businesses need and the business owners in order to ensure that their community continues to thriving economically.,63,,
325,0.97,2602.967,2604.635,I feel confident in community resilience side.,63,,
326,0.97,2604.635,2608.272,We have an overflow of data when I have been at the city.,63,,
327,0.97,2608.272,2614.878,If you go back 15 years and look at what black and Brown people needed 15 years ago it is the same thing.,63,,
328,0.97,2614.878,2615.579,It hasn't changed.,63,,
329,0.97,2615.579,2625.255,We put new names on it and described them differently but the reality is that black and Brown communities need the same thing today that they needed one hundred years ago.,63,,
330,0.97,2625.255,2625.623,Absolutely.,64,,
331,0.97,2625.623,2628.525,The community resilient side we have an overflow of information.,65,,
332,0.97,2628.525,2640.671,We don't have enough information on the small business side in local neighborhoods.,65,,
333,0.97,2640.671,2640.938,Okay.,66,,
334,0.97,2640.938,2641.238,Thank you.,66,,

342,0.97,2687.017,2693.524,I don't hear any so I want to thank both of you for joining us.,66,,
343,0.97,2693.524,2700.764,"I will say that again this is, you know, it is clear that the% recovery is going to take awhile.",66,,
344,0.97,2700.764,2706.804,That we have some serious work to do.,66,,
345,0.97,2706.804,2708.472,Big picture.,66,,

360,0.97,2795.726,2805.002,"So as I said, there is a lot of talk right now about how we save our small businesses and how we save downtown.",73,,
361,0.97,2805.002,2820.184,But it is important to remember that we have hundreds of Micro businesses and small businesses throughout the city who do need our support and who contribute to the vibrancy of our neighborhoods.,73,,
362,0.97,2820.184,2840.17,"Yesterday I mentioned an article that Josh wrote in Coca- Cola this week where he said ""what we actually learned during the past year not spending much time downtown is that neighborhoods are the magic quadrants of the city.",73,,
363,0.97,2840.17,2844.274,The past has Reenergys the city and to a new model.,73,,
364,0.97,2844.274,2854.351,"The focus for making Seattle vital is harnessing the new energy"" so I am excite to the have neighborhood folks here.",73,,
365,0.97,2854.351,2886.683,"I would like to ask you all to introduce yourself and take a few minutes to share some of the economic impact that you or your workers or organization members have faced in the past year and if you have idea for program changes that city can take to support or maintain or grow our small businesses and to support workers in the region I would like to have a conversation about that, too.",73,,
366,0.97,2886.683,2903.233,I will go ahead and open it up to--why don't we start with Angela and Rachel and when Camilla gets back on we will ask her to join us.,73,,
367,0.97,2903.233,2904.134,Hello.,74,,
368,0.97,2904.134,2910.474,Councilmember Morales for having me.,74,,
369,0.97,2910.474,2912.609,I'm a Seattle born.,74,,
370,0.97,2912.609,2928.125,And director of the business alliance nonprofit and also a community development consultant in Southeast Seattle working with the neighborhood CBS to connect small businesses with resources.,74,,
371,0.97,2928.125,2931.595,Advocating for equitable development.,74,,
372,0.97,2931.595,2941.438,And building relationships through multiple lingual and cultural Intersectional programming projects and events.,74,,
373,0.97,2941.438,2954.351,Beacon Hill is a district and the Oed only Seattle program that partially funds some of the work that we are doing.,74,,
374,0.97,2954.351,2965.762,I put an example of something that we are doing in the chat with live stream from this morning's event.,74,,
375,0.97,2965.762,2969.299,Powerful conversations and stories from business owners.,74,,
376,0.97,2969.299,2974.304,The outreach that we do and a dance of the event.,74,,
377,0.97,2974.304,3005.168,"It specifically is around bridging that Digital divide with Interpreters and Department of neighborhood community liaisons working directly with them to reach out to the language groups that we serve in this multi lingual five channels, so Malyi, VEE Aetna me.",74,,
378,0.97,3005.168,3005.435,Spanish.,74,,
379,0.97,3005.435,3042.406,"Madarin, English and so that we see people bring voices in from the fragile communities, the small business, the women immigrant family owned businesses that we are Prioritizing that Pamela spoke and got me all excited and a lot of the slides I was really dialed in multi year funding Participatory funding and Trisector effort is what we need to be doing.",74,,
380,0.97,3042.406,3043.907,On the ground.,74,,
381,0.97,3043.907,3066.396,Grassroots work that we do businesses like this project that I shared in the web stream in the chat is to help businesses to learn and be aware and connected to the resources that are becoming available.,74,,
382,0.97,3066.396,3073.904,So that is my big concern that is getting that information.,74,,
383,0.97,3073.904,3090.921,"Where it needs to go and which, it is the small Cbos in Southeast Seattle that I work through through the central Southeast Seattle collective.",74,,
384,0.97,3090.921,3108.405,A group of five small Cbos and Homesites creating Online E Commerce marketplace and also that components include.,74,,
385,0.97,3108.405,3113.11,"Deep outreach into the community and ongoing relationships that are multi year, right?",74,,
386,0.97,3113.11,3115.645,This is not just a one off high.,74,,
387,0.97,3115.645,3120.951,What is your feedback?,74,,
388,0.97,3120.951,3129.025,These are really key pieces that I know you're talking to today.,74,,
389,0.97,3129.025,3151.615,You are speaking to but what--I guess what I would close--I would close by saying that the connection to those business owners and guiding them to be particles of the conversation is the thing that is always missing.,74,,
390,0.97,3151.615,3151.948,Great.,75,,
391,0.97,3151.948,3154.084,"Thank you, Angela.",75,,
392,0.97,3154.084,3158.288,I know the work on beacon Hill is critical to the small businesses up there.,75,,
393,0.97,3158.288,3183.613,"When you took me on a tour of some of the businesses up there, it was great to meet with them and hear about, at that time, this was before Covid hit, there were some challenges and now I know it is even harder for some of those folks to be staying in business.",75,,
394,0.97,3183.613,3184.481,So thank you for that.,75,,
395,0.97,3184.481,3223.753,"And I will say that we--my staff and I had a conversation this morning with an organize that is really trying to help make connections with these, as a business accelerator for small Start-Ups and one of the things we talked about was this need to ensure access to the resources information and the mentors and the technology that can help build capacity quickly so folks can vet their idea and validate what they are working on.",75,,
396,0.97,3223.753,3237.567,Mitigate any--identify as many risks as possible before launching and kind of de risk the idea so they don't lose Lair shirts on something that may not be working.,75,,
397,0.97,3237.567,3238.535,Once we get folks going.,75,,
398,0.97,3238.535,3255.251,We need to make sure that we are supporting them and providing the kind of technical assistance or access to information that will allow them to stay in business and thrive.,75,,
399,0.97,3255.251,3263.26,So I want to hand it over to Ms. Saxton that is back on.,75,,
400,0.97,3263.26,3264.027,Can you hear me?,76,,
401,0.97,3264.027,3266.963,It sounds like we both got kicked off.,77,,
402,0.97,3266.963,3275.205,So I am glad you are able to join us on the phones too.,77,,
403,0.97,3275.205,3276.139,Likewise.,78,,
404,0.97,3276.139,3276.64,Introduce yourself.,79,,
405,0.97,3276.64,3295.158,I don't know how much you heard of the introduction but I am asking folk to introduce yourself and share the economic impacts that you and your workers have experienced in the last year.,79,,
406,0.97,3295.158,3302.332,If you have ideas for policy changes that the city could take to support small businesses I would love to hear about that too.,79,,
407,0.97,3302.332,3302.832,Great.,80,,
408,0.97,3302.832,3312.475,Thank you for inviting me to this call.,80,,
409,0.97,3312.475,3316.68,My name is Camilla Sackton Co- owner a restaurant.,80,,
410,0.97,3316.68,3326.022,We started off as a food truck and have expanded to three locations.,80,,
411,0.97,3326.022,3348.511,"We have shut down locations in Capitol Hill because of Covid- 19 and a large catering, obviously there is no large group gatherings anymore so Úthat is shut down as far as th bar in Pioneer called good bar but with the existing locations I am proud to say those stores are opened.",80,,
412,0.97,3348.511,3349.112,Our staff is back.,80,,
413,0.97,3349.112,3367.931,"And those locations are solid and residents of Columbia city, the South end, and I feel pretty tight with the businesses in our neighborhood and obviously tied to this neighborhood where poison will go to school.",80,,
414,0.97,3367.931,3383.747,When we talk about program changes I want to say as a business owner I feel incredibly lucky that I can reach out to my Councilmember and she will hold a meeting with me on her anniversary.,80,,
415,0.97,3383.747,3395.725,One of her staff attended on her birthday and when we heard this over and over we are all in this together.,80,,
416,0.97,3395.725,3399.262,I felt all of that statement.,80,,
417,0.97,3399.262,3405.869,They are very special as a small business owner and number of South Seattle.,80,,
418,0.97,3405.869,3415.178,So thank you Councilmember Morales and Alexis for doing that.,80,,
419,0.97,3415.178,3420.917,It meant a lot and it reconfirmed your stance that we are all in this together.,80,,
420,0.97,3420.917,3421.651,Thank you again.,80,,
421,0.97,3421.651,3445.442,One of the things I mentioned in that meeting that I think will have the most immediate impact and not rocket science but Roz and I my business partner have understood some of the other business owners struggle.,80,,
422,0.97,3445.442,3452.482,What will save us and not from the city and state level but the Feds.,80,,
423,0.97,3452.482,3458.655,The Ppe or the restaurant recovery program will save my industry.,80,,
424,0.97,3458.655,3486.449,"What we have learned from them is that it is very difficult and the latest grant that has come out it is--you need to be certain numbers, and a Dins number and the majority of business centers don't know what that is.",80,,
425,0.97,3486.449,3493.656,A difficult thing to navigate and Roz and I are door knocking saying do you need help doing this?,80,,
426,0.97,3493.656,3494.891,Did you know of this?,80,,
427,0.97,3494.891,3496.86,Do you know what a Sames number is.,80,,
428,0.97,3496.86,3501.931,When you go to the Website and get the Sames number it doesn't look Legit but it is.,80,,
429,0.97,3501.931,3510.773,That is where you get the Sames number.,80,,
430,0.97,3510.773,3515.245,I genuinely believe that the city has a great effort.,80,,
431,0.97,3515.245,3537.267,"I contacted Oed last Friday and they will meet to figure out ways, maybe it is Online Tutorial and working with small Nonprofits in the South end and do door knocking and here is a Website, what help do you need?",80,,
432,0.97,3537.267,3552.115,It is a grassroots campaign because the grants available is specific to my industry Estaurant.,80,,
433,0.97,3552.115,3557.52,But also restaurants have a living room number of women of color.,80,,
434,0.97,3557.52,3563.96,These entrance are available and here is how you access this and do you need help?,80,,
435,0.97,3563.96,3571.401,"That is work for in our neighborhood approach and this one will expire in three week, the latest one.",80,,
436,0.97,3571.401,3585.748,"So from a city level, I mean I am not sure how fast this is but the neighborhood level, things can happen.",80,,
437,0.97,3585.748,3599.128,"So the other thing I want to mention is the decision maker and policymaker, this growing unemployment insurance benefit.",80,,
438,0.97,3599.128,3601.965,We had to lay off at one time 50% of our staff.,80,,
439,0.97,3601.965,3623.453,We have brought back 70% of our staff but we had one of the lowest unemployment insurance rates for restaurants because we just typically don't have to--we don't Laypeople off but our unemployment rate will sky rocket.,80,,
440,0.97,3623.453,3635.999,I guess you have to build that fun up again but there has to be assistance there.,80,,
441,0.97,3635.999,3636.366,It's a killer.,80,,
442,0.97,3636.366,3637.3,It's incredibly high.,80,,
443,0.97,3637.3,3642.739,I will stop there because I know those are two tangible pieces of information.,80,,
444,0.97,3642.739,3647.01,"Instead of going on, I will stop there.",80,,
445,0.97,3647.01,3647.41,Thank you again.,80,,
446,0.97,3647.41,3650.413,Thank you.,81,,
447,0.97,3650.413,3650.947,Thanks so much Camilla.,81,,
448,0.97,3650.947,3658.621,I appreciate your being here and sharing from a business owner's perspective some of the challenges you are having.,81,,
449,0.97,3658.621,3673.569,You are right the restaurant industry is particular challenges as well because of the very customer based nature of that work that you do.,81,,
450,0.97,3673.569,3673.936,Yes.,82,,
451,0.97,3673.936,3682.545,I want to move on to Rachel and open it to questions from my colleagues.,82,,
452,0.97,3682.545,3688.251,Rachel can you introduce yourself and share with us what you have been experiencing this year?,82,,
453,0.97,3688.251,3688.551,Sure.,83,,
454,0.97,3688.551,3689.619,Good to see you all.,83,,
455,0.97,3689.619,3702.865,My name is Rachel loader and director of the Washington network center and build worker power through organizations and advocacy campaigns and legal services and work to uphold standards in industries.,83,,
456,0.97,3702.865,3710.606,And I really appreciate you including me in this space.,83,,
457,0.97,3710.606,3716.045,As you know Covid is devastating.,83,,
458,0.97,3716.045,3722.185,Unemployment concerns and continued issues around wages they are all exacerbated.,83,,
459,0.97,3722.185,3733.896,I think it is hard for us to Prioritize in the last year and some of the things are getting people paid and health and safety.,83,,
460,0.97,3733.896,3742.038,"On getting people paid one of the major priorities is our payoff campaign, an effort to pay delivery workers.",83,,
461,0.97,3742.038,3745.041,Some of the lowest paid workers in our community.,83,,
462,0.97,3745.041,3750.813,If we pass a law that provides pay standards for them it will be the first law of its kind in the country.,83,,
463,0.97,3750.813,3759.455,"These are workers who have been delivering us, our food and groceries this past year.",83,,
464,0.97,3759.455,3773.736,They are essential and thank you for passing emergency laws that provide safe time and hazard pay for the workers we think for there to be a fair recovery need to make these protections permanent.,83,,
465,0.97,3773.736,3780.61,We have been instrumental in the advocacy and in administering the Washington relief Fund.,83,,
466,0.97,3780.61,3789.218,The state fund that provides state assistance to Undocumented workers and provided advocacy around unemployment insurance reform.,83,,
467,0.97,3789.218,3799.929,We have to figure out ways to get cash to people as quickly as possible within moments of crisis like we have experienced for a year and during regular time.,83,,
468,0.97,3799.929,3805.868,The Ui system is designed to reject people from this system.,83,,
469,0.97,3805.868,3811.541,Like the whole way it is designed to keep people from getting it and we have to change that paradigm.,83,,
470,0.97,3811.541,3819.215,"From a health and safety perspective, I can't stress enough the vaccines.",83,,
471,0.97,3819.215,3823.252,Anyone to work in person should have equal access to the vaccine.,83,,
472,0.97,3823.252,3833.229,We are hearing concerns from folks particularly in the food service industry that they don't have access to the vaccine.,83,,
473,0.97,3833.229,3838.267,That is important and we need health and safety laws and the expansion of them.,83,,
474,0.97,3838.267,3845.575,We will fight this year to extend the paid sick laws to domestic workers.,83,,
475,0.97,3845.575,3853.449,We are always happy to talk to the city about ways to do more at the city level.,83,,
476,0.97,3853.449,3854.617,Anti retaliation laws.,83,,
477,0.97,3854.617,3860.59,Also add that under the buckets of get people paid and health and safety.,83,,
478,0.97,3860.59,3863.426,Investing in labor standards and Ols.,83,,
479,0.97,3863.426,3869.131,It is critical during the economic recovery period.,83,,
480,0.97,3869.131,3878.841,Some very interesting recent studies show that wage theft increases and impacts black and Brown worker.,83,,
481,0.97,3878.841,3909.672,We need strong worker protections in Seattle that ensuring that Ols has what it needs to do to do its job and the final thing is to make sure there is no austerity budgeting and find new revenue and we are engaged with that on the state level and we have to invest in our community and that is what our just recovery will look like for the wage workers.,83,,
482,0.97,3909.672,3912.942,I will stop there.,83,,
483,0.97,3912.942,3914.043,"Thank you, Rachel.",84,,
484,0.97,3914.043,3917.88,So I--I have got a couple of questions.,84,,
485,0.97,3917.88,3923.252,One for you and maybe one for Camilla.,84,,
486,0.97,3923.252,3946.776,I'm curious about the unemployment insurance reform especially since Camilla mentioned that rates will go up incredibly and what kind of assistance folks will be needing to address that.,84,,
487,0.97,3946.776,3952.515,The rates will go up and folks don't have access to that and questions about the permitting issues.,84,,
488,0.97,3952.515,3957.687,We are having conversations about how businesses get permitted.,84,,
489,0.97,3957.687,3980.576,"I know food related businesses have additional permit requirements with the public health Department and curious, if you can talk about some of the issues that you have experienced and how that can delay the work that you are trying to do.",84,,
490,0.97,3980.576,3986.482,Issues billed out with the Department of planning and long delays.,85,,
491,0.97,3986.482,3996.392,Unfortunately I am not going to be building out any restaurants in next year and so that is actually--but people will be.,85,,
492,0.97,3996.392,4000.596,When your paying rent for the time you are waiting on permits time is ticking.,85,,
493,0.97,4000.596,4005.101,Every day you don't get that permit you are paying rent on a building that you cap use.,85,,
494,0.97,4005.101,4016.445,If there can be a way to expedite the process around construction build out will be fantastic.,85,,
495,0.97,4016.445,4026.589,And I also appreciate that there are rules and regulations to build outs but there has to be a way to expedite the process.,85,,
496,0.97,4026.589,4032.094,"As far as unemployment insurance, again, I get that this fund needs to be replenished.",85,,
497,0.97,4032.094,4034.797,And there is--they are going to extend that.,85,,
498,0.97,4034.797,4047.71,"Instead of asking for our rates to go up, and paying the increase, the wage height next year it will be extended several years.",85,,
499,0.97,4047.71,4052.848,May be three years and may need to be extended further out.,85,,
500,0.97,4052.848,4060.723,Again I understand that fund needs to be rebuilt but it will take awhile.,85,,
501,0.97,4060.723,4063.726,When your rates go up 3000% that will take awhile to build.,85,,
502,0.97,4063.726,4085.981,There are--it is a permitting process and extending the unemployment rate hike to help business owners in the community.,85,,
503,0.97,4085.981,4090.853,The state Legislature as you mentioned addressed some of the rate hike time line.,86,,
504,0.97,4090.853,4095.124,I may be curious about what would be a better time line.,86,,
505,0.97,4095.124,4107.67,For us we hear from thousands of workers that have experienced unbelievable delays in getting even the case Adjudicated by the state.,86,,
506,0.97,4107.67,4112.608,And so that is where the focus is and needs to get the decisions out quicker.,86,,
507,0.97,4112.608,4118.147,Another thing to get focused on is overpayments.,86,,
508,0.97,4118.147,4133.596,"So what will happen is folks unemployed for months are getting notices from the state that say you now owe Washington state $15,000 because we Adjudicated your case incorrectly and you shouldn't have got unemployment.",86,,
509,0.97,4133.596,4143.339,And people will say we have not got unemployment and there has been inconsistency and try to bring from reason and clarity to this process.,86,,
510,0.97,4143.339,4146.742,So there is--that's a long- term project to reform Esd.,86,,
511,0.97,4146.742,4151.68,For us the most important thing is when you are unemployed in the middle of a crisis.,86,,
512,0.97,4151.68,4154.884,"You need the money now, right?",86,,
513,0.97,4154.884,4163.125,So what are the ways to resource the various levels of government and getting cash to people as quickly as possible.,86,,
514,0.97,4163.125,4176.672,That is what we do at the state level and I know there is good city programs for emergency everyone to invest in those E because we saw that the need was so great and has been.,86,,
515,0.97,4176.672,4180.042,It is this high pitch need for over a year now.,86,,
516,0.97,4180.042,4183.946,"I will tell you one of the things, two things.",87,,
517,0.97,4183.946,4201.23,"One, I have never been prouder of being a small business owner in my life than during Covid because we were able to provide additional loans to our employees that went months without get can employment checks.",87,,
518,0.97,4201.23,4201.997,There is an individual.,87,,
519,0.97,4201.997,4214.977,We got her name and number from an employee that says this woman was fantastic and cleared up my unemployment insurance claim within a matter of two days and I got paid.,87,,
520,0.97,4214.977,4235.464,"We took her name and phone contact information and all of the employees, our 15 employes that did not get--they were without unemployment, this woman, we need a thousand of her and people will be fine.",87,,
521,0.97,4235.464,4239.535,People will be paid.,87,,
522,0.97,4239.535,4249.078,It was unbelievable process and I know she is working outside of her normal hours to help people.,87,,
523,0.97,4249.078,4264.159,But I know this can be done because this one woman eased the lives of 15 individuals within two or three days.,87,,
524,0.97,4264.159,4265.561,"Thank you, Camilla.",88,,
525,0.97,4265.561,4271.8,I think there is so many city and state workers that are trying really hard to keep up.,88,,
526,0.97,4271.8,4273.936,Yes.,89,,
527,0.97,4273.936,4279.274,With all of the challenges that our community is having.,90,,
528,0.97,4279.274,4285.18,So appreciate you acknowledging one of the people working hard.,90,,
529,0.97,4285.18,4299.161,Is there any other questions or issues that you would like to address?,90,,
530,0.97,4299.161,4299.428,Okay.,91,,
531,0.97,4299.428,4320.382,"I do have final questions for Angela, if you could talk a little bit about from your perspective as the business alliance on beacon Hill what the city can do to support current businesses and to really invest in the next generation of businesses.",91,,
532,0.97,4320.382,4329.825,We know that for many folks there is entrepreneurial spirit there is--people want to bring their ideas to life.,91,,
533,0.97,4329.825,4346.141,For many people starting their own business it is one way to generate income for their family and so do you have ideas about how we can as a city start to invest in that next generation of entrepreneurs?,91,,
534,0.97,4346.141,4372.434,I really have to speak just from my little focus and my lens in working with businesses that are Strugglig to launch something--legacy businesses that are struggling to stay alive.,92,,
535,0.97,4372.434,4396.692,It's almost--to me comes down to the same thing and that is making sure that the mentors advocates and the Cbos that are doing that work and helping support those steps are supported by the city.,92,,
536,0.97,4396.692,4400.629,By the government through funding.,92,,
537,0.97,4400.629,4411.573,Because often I find that we are not--unless--I'm not a policy person and I'm a program person.,92,,
538,0.97,4411.573,4424.92,But--so I need to have that relationship with you and--but if I'm--right now a business owner that was displaced.,92,,
539,0.97,4424.92,4462.891,"Family that was displaced out of a spot on beacon hill in 2017 and we are--she is working on the younger generation of that family is working on signing a lease and a new construction spot on beacon Hill so watching--going through that transition of supporting that family to build trust with that family that didn't have trust around government resources and, right?",92,,
540,0.97,4462.891,4465.227,Speaking to that today.,92,,
541,0.97,4465.227,4469.865,Requires somebody being there for that.,92,,
542,0.97,4469.865,4480.142,And working with bringing--working all the different components together including negotiating with the builder and the landlord and all of the different components.,92,,
543,0.97,4480.142,4488.05,It is critical and it doesn't--you just can't do it overnight.,92,,
544,0.97,4488.05,4494.122,It's understanding how--what that need is--it's complicated.,92,,
545,0.97,4494.122,4505.434,It is so complicated for--you just can't get it--so I don't know who the business advisory--I will just say it.,92,,
546,0.97,4505.434,4508.337,I don't know who the folks are.,92,,
547,0.97,4508.337,4512.107,The business advisory committee.,92,,
548,0.97,4512.107,4512.841,They are appointed.,92,,
549,0.97,4512.841,4531.96,"I don't know who--you know, listening and being in the room with you all today and Pamela banks delivery of the talking about the scope where thing are and what you are thinking sounds beautiful.",92,,
550,0.97,4531.96,4540.836,"But on the ground here, it is still a struggle of calling that business owner.",92,,
551,0.97,4540.836,4551.046,Calling that entrepreneur with a new idea that wants to go a physical space and all of those ducks are not in a row yet.,92,,
552,0.97,4551.046,4559.388,"That business plan, all of those businesses.",92,,
553,0.97,4559.388,4559.821,It's overwhelming.,92,,
554,0.97,4559.821,4560.489,Yeah.,93,,
555,0.97,4560.489,4561.723,I get that.,93,,
556,0.97,4561.723,4566.962,"I hear the frustration in your voice Angela, so thank you.",93,,
557,0.97,4566.962,4596.725,"You know for my perspective before talking about an inclusive economy and talking about an equitable recovery, that means that we give someone that has a good idea a chance which means we need to make sure they have access to the technical assistance and the, you know, mentors and understands what it means to access capital.",93,,
558,0.97,4596.725,4613.141,Folk may have a great idea but they still might also need some skills to turn that idea in to a product and a business.,93,,
559,0.97,4613.141,4627.089,Not everyone has access and the background and the knowledge and Understnding of the ECO is system that exists to support a new business and that doesn't mean that they don't have a good idea.,93,,
560,0.97,4627.089,4657.052,What it means is that we are going to have inclusive economy we need to make sure they get access to sources available and elevate that Ecosystem so that folks are able to benefit and you know go down the path and take that kind of step by step learning that it takes to turn your idea into a successful business.,93,,
561,0.97,4657.052,4674.236,So happy to keep talking with you about how to bring that to elevate that process and make folk are aware of that and take advantage of that.,93,,
562,0.97,4674.236,4681.743,Colleagues last call if you have a question.,94,,
563,0.97,4681.743,4685.747,This is the time.,94,,
