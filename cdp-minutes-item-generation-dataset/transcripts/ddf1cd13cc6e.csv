45,0.97,209.809,215.415,I'm a resident of district 4 and I'm a member of the domestic worker standards board.,8,,
46,0.97,215.415,218.117,I occupy one of the seats for hiring groups.,8,,
47,0.97,218.117,224.624,I'm here today to make comment on the transparency requirements for contract workers.,8,,
48,0.97,224.624,243.843,"Specifically, I want to make comments about the process that's gone in to the piece of legislation and because of the process I feel like despite being a member of the standards board I'm not in a position to comment on the content of the legislation.",8,,
49,0.97,243.843,266.266,The proposed legislation seems to be good for workers but I'm concerned that the city has not done enough engagement with domestic workers and for that matter with hiring groups to bow search that workers in support of this and they--that there won't be unintended consequences.,8,,
50,0.97,266.266,277.71,"One is the worker who are Undocumented, there's a lot of fear and Unsunset.",8,,
51,0.97,277.71,287.253,To work through the fears and Miss Givings it's hard for us to know if domestic workers actually support the proposal as it currently is.,8,,
52,0.97,287.253,301.401,I think it's particularly surprising and disappointing that workers covered under the domestic worker's ordinance were included in the legislation at this point give then Council has not engaged the full domestic standards board on this issue.,8,,
53,0.97,301.401,305.038,The little bit of engagement we have had with Council.,8,,
54,0.97,305.038,315.682,"The outcome of that was our request to be deeper, broader engagement with domestic workers to ensure that workers are in support of the legislation.",8,,
55,0.97,315.682,322.789,Even moving beyond that we know that there may be other Workern who are concerned about this legislation.,8,,
56,0.97,322.789,327.36,"So, I really am concerned about the process here and thank you for juror time.",8,,

347,0.97,2157.588,2182.313,"As folks know, it--per our tradition if there is a reappointment they do not need to come in and Prepresent with us because we have had the chance to meet them and folks will really remember Emily from all of the work she did with us as we were crafting the domestic worker's standards board and I will let you talk about her as well Thenly maybe fill in some more information.",57,,
348,0.97,2182.313,2186.417,Was just going to say a couple things.,58,,

353,0.97,2231.195,2274.605,"The hiring group side of how to comply with the domestic worker's bill of rights and wanting to make sure that we provided information available to various types of hiring groups so that people had information in hand to want to be--who wanted to be the high road employers, how they could make sure they respected worker's rights and having tools in their hand was really important because, you know, a lot of people who hire a Nanny, House cleaner, gardener, et cetera, are not used to beg in the employer position and wanting to have access to example contracts, and make sure they were paying the Righta amount and something that should lift up.",59,,
354,0.97,2274.605,2279.21,That's great to work with her and she founded the company in 1997.,59,,
355,0.97,2279.21,2309.64,"Has been a strong activist here locally and nationally and continues to work for fair wages and really, really proud of the work she did with us to craft the ordinance originally and I know she continues to work with the Washington state collaborative task force and continued to speak up about the right workers as Speakinga behalf of what--hiring groups.",59,,
356,0.97,2309.64,2312.576,Local family homes as their workplaces.,59,,

400,0.97,2470.401,2471.168,Thank you so much.,74,,
401,0.97,2471.168,2475.706,Thank you chair Mosqueda for taking time.,74,,
402,0.97,2475.706,2480.211,Just as a--little bit of background.,74,,
403,0.97,2480.211,2480.878,Back on April 6th.,74,,
404,0.97,2480.878,2487.251,In this Andiste we heard from the labor standards advisory Commission.,74,,
405,0.97,2487.251,2494.792,Want to specifically thank you Liz and Gaye for taking the time to come and present their recommendations to the Council.,74,,
406,0.97,2494.792,2515.112,These recommendations stem from the passage of resolution 31863 which called on Lsac to develop recommendations to address the Miss classifying of employees as into contractors.,74,,
407,0.97,2515.112,2525.823,Rather than focusing on whether or not the city should reclassify people who we felt were being Miss classified.,74,,
408,0.97,2525.823,2549.213,"We instead decide that the recommendation--or Lsac decided that the recommendation should instead focus on ensuring that people who are classified as contractors, were or not they are being Miss classed or not get some basic information around the terms of their employment.",74,,
409,0.97,2549.213,2560.391,That's why their recommendations focused on transparency and access to information among those currently classified in the contractor.,74,,
410,0.97,2560.391,2576.34,"Recommendation is policy regarding hiring groups, to provide greater independent contractor--contract workers, Precontract and post contract information so they can understand the terms of their engagement and determine if the terms have been satisfied.",74,,
411,0.97,2576.34,2592.489,"Even though we were not able to hear the draft legislation last Committee, again this is draft legislation, it's not yet been introduced and appreciate the opportunity to work through some of the issues in committee before we introduce the legislation.",74,,
412,0.97,2592.489,2607.972,We have been continuing to have meetings with stake holders and Karina has been fantastic to--to include the input of the stake holders so that she can provide today's draft legislation and presentation.,74,,
413,0.97,2607.972,2636.433,"We have received feedback on the draft from the office of labor standards and we have heard from community as we heard this morning that gig workers, want additional protection beyond those recommended in the Lsac report and I appreciate the efforts of the campaign to introduce compensation issue that were not dealt with in the bill but we have--we will hear more about this.",74,,
414,0.97,2636.433,2646.143,A Noncodified section in the bill that outlines a Timeline to address the concerns and hold this responsible to address the concerns.,74,,
415,0.97,2646.143,2662.226,My conversations with the platforms as well as that--they too are committed to engaging in conversations around compensation and our efforts to address that in another bill.,74,,
416,0.97,2662.226,2662.893,Thank you.,74,,
417,0.97,2662.893,2667.064,Thank you very much.,75,,
418,0.97,2667.064,2668.298,Good morning and welcome.,75,,
419,0.97,2668.298,2670.167,Thank you.,76,,
420,0.97,2670.167,2680.577,I'm Karina bull with Council steal staff and I prepared a presentation for the draft legislation for the independent contractor protection.,76,,
421,0.97,2680.577,2692.523,"So, I will seek to share my screen to up load that presentation.",76,,
422,0.97,2692.523,2694.658,It's a little bit advanced.,76,,
423,0.97,2694.658,2695.025,Here we go.,76,,
424,0.97,2695.025,2717.448,"So, this--legislation as Councilmember Herbold has already set up will require protections for all contractors working in Seattle that are working for covered hire groups and the key Partsst legislation do stem from the recommendations by the labor standards advisory board.",76,,
425,0.97,2717.448,2720.484,The key recommendations are for Precontract disclosures.,76,,
426,0.97,2720.484,2729.026,This draft also reflects a new requirement for timely payment and I will go into the details of that later on in this presentation.,76,,
427,0.97,2729.026,2740.704,The legislation would become effective on March first of next year for the labor standards protections and it would be enforced by the office of labor standards.,76,,
428,0.97,2740.704,2748.812,Hiring group coverage has--drafted in the current legislation would include commercial hiring groups that's basically another name.,76,,
429,0.97,2748.812,2753.584,Hiring an independent contractor to support their business services.,76,,
430,0.97,2753.584,2764.294,"If it's a small business owner that is perhaps not incorporated, if that business owner it would hire a contractor in their personal life to do something for them that.",76,,
431,0.97,2764.294,2767.698,Year would not be--if they hire aid contractor.,76,,
432,0.97,2767.698,2775.405,If it's a Bookkeeper or Carmenter then that contractor would be covered.,76,,
433,0.97,2775.405,2781.812,Also covered are any hiring group that hires an independent contractor for domestic worker services.,76,,
434,0.97,2781.812,2791.688,That would be both the business and a private party.,76,,
435,0.97,2791.688,2798.328,As far as contractor coverage it's folks working in whole or part of Seattle.,76,,
436,0.97,2798.328,2800.43,Takes place in Seattle.,76,,
437,0.97,2800.43,2802.966,They would be covered.,76,,
438,0.97,2802.966,2812.242,There are exclusions in the legislation for attorneys and licensed medical professionals working with in the scope of the profession.,76,,
439,0.97,2812.242,2822.252,They work under a--under a code of ethics that the governor practices and they have significant bargaining power that may not be available to other contractors.,76,,
440,0.97,2822.252,2837.1,Also when the legislation is the opportunity for--that will exempt other years working in professions covered by a similar code of ethics.,76,,
441,0.97,2837.1,2846.677,The Precontract disclosure as we have heard would provide basic information about the proposed terms and conditions of work.,76,,
442,0.97,2846.677,2852.249,This could take place in the form of a piece of paper that says Precontract disclosure.,76,,
443,0.97,2852.249,2854.885,It could be actually in a job offer.,76,,
444,0.97,2854.885,2859.923,It could be in a contract with that both parties have agreed to.,76,,
445,0.97,2859.923,2870.968,The premise is before the independent contractor begins work that person is informed of the terms and conditions and the payment schedule and other vital information.,76,,
446,0.97,2870.968,2874.638,That may lead to the independent contractor not beginning work with the terms aren't favorable.,76,,
447,0.97,2874.638,2885.249,If they do then they will have a written document that reflects the terms of their work.,76,,
448,0.97,2885.249,2892.256,It would about provided in English and the independent contract ear's primary language.,76,,
449,0.97,2892.256,2903.7,The three parts that have legislation near the three parts of the wage--or employees so essentially this ordinance would be the wage theft ordinance for independent contractors.,76,,
450,0.97,2903.7,2905.802,A parallel to the ordinance for employees.,76,,
451,0.97,2905.802,2926.39,One of the reasons I Mentiond that is because in the wage theft ordinance for employees there is a requirement for--notice of employment information that is very similar to this Precontract disclosure and it's required for employers to provide that information in English and in the employee's primary language.,76,,
452,0.97,2926.39,2931.261,With that is where this requirement comes from their the translation.,76,,
453,0.97,2931.261,2946.276,Here I won't go through all of these pieces of information but this gives you a flavor of the different kinds of required items and the Precontract disclosure to make sure workers Nope the basics of the proposed work.,76,,
454,0.97,2946.276,2951.014,Next is a requirement for timely payment.,76,,
455,0.97,2951.014,2962.192,This is--if a contractor begins working for a hiring group and then they are owed the money that is reflected in the Precontract disclosure.,76,,
456,0.97,2962.192,2967.631,It's payment of the amount due or related contract if that is something that the parties have entered in it.,76,,
457,0.97,2967.631,2980.51,The payment would be due on a specified date if will no specified date payment is due no later than 30 days after the completion of the independent contractor's services.,76,,
458,0.97,2980.51,2983.714,There are two other places right now.,76,,
459,0.97,2983.714,2993.357,"Two other jurisdictions that have laws for free Lancers, New York City, Minneapolis, both of those laws do require timely payment.",76,,
460,0.97,2993.357,2998.695,Their laws are requiring written contract in a timely payment.,76,,
461,0.97,2998.695,3007.671,This is not unprecedented territory for a jurisdiction to require this kind of legal obligation for independent contractors.,76,,
462,0.97,3007.671,3014.244,And last the third main part of this legislation is a payment disclosure which is another word for an item pay receipt.,76,,
463,0.97,3014.244,3020.851,It would be something that a hiring group would need to provide in a written format.,76,,
464,0.97,3020.851,3025.889,Each time that the wages are--and payment is paid to--independent contractor.,76,,
465,0.97,3025.889,3033.897,There is not a requirement to provide this information in the independent contractor's primary language.,76,,
466,0.97,3033.897,3036.066,Similar to the wage theft ordinance.,76,,
467,0.97,3036.066,3050.013,"There is an item pay statement and that ordinance as well, here again is an overview of the information that is required by the payment disclosure.",76,,
468,0.97,3050.013,3056.853,It's closely modeled after the item pay statement that are required for employees.,76,,
469,0.97,3056.853,3066.229,This also reflects the recommendation of the labor standards advisory board as do the parts of the Precontract disclosures.,76,,
470,0.97,3066.229,3079.743,"Other work requirements in the legislation are familiar to folks who already know about our labor standards L is a notice of rights requirement, Requiringed to be in English and the primary language.",76,,
471,0.97,3079.743,3106.503,"And creating model notices for this notice of rights as well as model notices in English and other languages of the Precontract disclosure and payment disclosure, there would be record keeping requirements, and prohibited retaliation so if the worker asks for a Precontract disclosure the hiring group would be prevented from retaliating against that worker.",76,,
472,0.97,3106.503,3110.607,Enforcement would be by the office of labor standards.,76,,
473,0.97,3110.607,3123.22,They would be able to endorse violations whether through a complaint or through a directed investigation by an investigation and there are something new in this legislation called a complaint prosecute said you're.,76,,
474,0.97,3123.22,3127.724,That is--the steps of that are outlined in the legislation.,76,,
475,0.97,3127.724,3153.283,"The idea behind the complaint procedure is that it's a way for office of labor standards to address complaints of violation and a way that is fast, efficient and hopefully not controversial and it has basically Ols being the Pathway of information to both parties.",76,,
476,0.97,3153.283,3163.293,I complaint isn't would target Ols--would send a notice to the hiring group and then they would provide Knox back to Ols which would be sent back to the hiring group.,76,,
477,0.97,3163.293,3182.012,It's not a situation where Ols would be making a determination of if a violation happened but it's a say for a contractor who may not feel comfortable directly connecting with the hiring group to try to get the information or try to get the payment.,76,,
478,0.97,3182.012,3192.556,Afterwards the contractor if necessary could go to court to enforce the legislation or perhaps a hiring group would comply as a result the process going forward.,76,,
479,0.97,3192.556,3205.368,There would be a private rite of action which means that contractors would have the ability to file a lawsuit in order to get the disclosure notices or to get the payment.,76,,
480,0.97,3205.368,3212.208,The court could award attorney fees and plus costs which is really important for contractors who are trying to seek payment.,76,,
481,0.97,3212.208,3221.585,There's a wealth of studies that I think about a 70% of contractors get late payment at some point in time during the work or no payment at all.,76,,
482,0.97,3221.585,3224.854,Very small number of folks pursue the claims.,76,,
483,0.97,3224.854,3229.259,It's as little as 5% in some areas of the country.,76,,
484,0.97,3229.259,3244.374,The ability to receive attorney fees upon prevailing for a claim to get payment is really significant and can provide the support and the boost for contractors to make sure they get paid to go to court for that.,76,,
485,0.97,3244.374,3248.144,"Remedies would be getting the disclosure, getting the unpaid compensation.",76,,
486,0.97,3248.144,3262.192,"Similar to a--I believe all of the labor standards and for the wage theft ordinance for employees there could be the ability to get up to three times the amount owed, timely payment is not provided.",76,,
487,0.97,3262.192,3274.07,"Penalties and fines up to a little over $4,500 per violation and office of labor standards could lower the fines depending on the circumstances of each situation.",76,,
488,0.97,3274.137,3274.371,Et's see.,76,,
489,0.97,3274.371,3276.74,Moving close to the end.,76,,
490,0.97,3276.74,3287.317,Something noticeable about this legislation is that there is a unique enforcement mode El that was recommended by the labor standards advisory Commission.,76,,
491,0.97,3287.317,3307.27,It's a Rebuttable [inaudible] for payment this is a legal term for what happens if a hiring group doesn't provide a Precontract disclosure work are the terms and conditions and what if the hiring group provides a Precontract but doesn't honor it when it comes time to pay the contractor.,76,,
492,0.97,3307.27,3319.649,If those Situatins if there is no disclosure there would be a legal understanding--Recontributable by clear and count convincing evidence that the contractor's claims for payment are true.,76,,
493,0.97,3319.649,3333.029,Sothat means that the court or Ols would describe the contractor unless the hiring group provided evidence that supported their version of the situation.,76,,
494,0.97,3333.029,3336.466,No we didn't actually promise to pay $100 for this.,76,,
495,0.97,3336.466,3345.842,We promised to pay $50 and here is our written contract to show that.,76,,
496,0.97,3345.842,3373.036,"Also, there is a Noncodified section that would reference the Council's intent for gig workers and that would consist of minimum compensation, flexibility protection, transparency information, right now the legislation announced the Council allege intent to consider such legislation for full council vote before the beginning of the fall budget deliberation.",76,,
497,0.97,3373.036,3377.24,That is all for my presentation of the basics of the legislation.,76,,
498,0.97,3377.24,3385.882,I have identified some issues that the Council may want to consider but certainly would like to open it up for comments and questions.,76,,
499,0.97,3385.882,3389.185,Let's hold there for a second.,77,,
500,0.97,3389.185,3390.487,Please go head.,77,,
501,0.97,3390.487,3390.754,Yes.,78,,
502,0.97,3390.754,3395.425,If we could go back to slide 2.,78,,
503,0.97,3395.425,3401.931,Just want to--take a minute to clarify some thing around the hiring group coverage.,78,,
504,0.97,3401.931,3421.985,"You know this--we all received recommendations from domestic worker Stander standards or back on April, what was it April 8th the recommendations are covered on page 6 and 10 and I will read the Excertificate from ten.",78,,
505,0.97,3426.656,3441.838,They recommend providing works about their rights and this should be considered the Council's consideration of tried transparency for independent contractors if that moves forward.,78,,
506,0.97,3441.838,3442.672,"So, the inclusion.",78,,
507,0.97,3442.672,3446.976,We had planned to discuss this in a last committee meeting.,78,,
508,0.97,3446.976,3464.26,There was--a memo that Karina produced that had options that we could pursue including in sort of picking choosing across a lot of different issues which Kar Ina had identified.,78,,
509,0.97,3464.26,3485.481,"This was one of those issues and I moved forward asking Qarina that in this version of the bill, again it's not been introduced yet that the bill includes, coverage for the hiring groups, hiring domestic workers based on the April 6th recommendations.",78,,
510,0.97,3485.481,3501.498,I understand Proconversations that we have had recently that there is interest in actually not including these recommendations in the bill before us.,78,,
511,0.97,3501.498,3506.769,So I signaled Karina that I'm happy to pull this part of the language out of the bill.,78,,
512,0.97,3506.769,3515.144,I wanted to make sure that was really clear because of some of the testimony we have heard this morning.,78,,
513,0.97,3515.144,3517.247,Thank you for that.,79,,
514,0.97,3517.247,3527.156,Are there any questions account the information that's been provided so far before going into issue Id 's,79,,
515,0.97,3527.156,3529.492,Kar I'm not seeing any additional questions.,80,,
516,0.97,3529.492,3531.794,I want to give folks a quick second.,80,,
517,0.97,3531.794,3536.532,"Just want to make sure that I understand the Councilmember, thank you for that.",80,,
518,0.97,3536.532,3542.672,When we look at that second bullet then.,80,,
519,0.97,3542.672,3549.913,Can I also just double check here in the memo it said that the legislation would not cover Noncommercalups.,80,,
520,0.97,3549.913,3561.925,Does that mean that the domestic worker hired under the second bullet point would have to be hired by a commercial group or is that whole issue taken care of,80,,
521,0.97,3561.925,3583.313,"So if there is--I'm going to make up a situation here but if there is--like Microsoft is hiring, a domestic worker for an employee that lives in Seattle and Microsoft is play pay that domestic worker and hiring them then in that situation the domestic worker would be covered.",81,,
522,0.97,3583.313,3593.323,It is a domestic worker hired by a commercial hiring group.,81,,
523,0.97,3593.323,3593.59,Okay.,82,,
524,0.97,3593.59,3602.432,This is going to then be scoped to just commercial hiring group.,82,,
525,0.97,3602.432,3603.099,Correct.,83,,
526,0.97,3603.099,3603.299,Then.,83,,
527,0.97,3603.299,3603.566,Go head.,83,,
528,0.97,3603.566,3616.679,Any independent contractor hired by a private party would not be covered just--commercial hiring groups for the legislation but if--any contractor hired by the business.,84,,
529,0.97,3616.679,3619.082,By a business.,85,,
530,0.97,3619.082,3636.499,"So, I have not sort of done a side by side comparison with domestic workers bill of rights that we passed and we will admit we are also doing this Úin addition to the--I haven' had the chance to really do a side by side with the domestic worker's.",85,,
531,0.97,3636.499,3662.992,"Him I'm trying to remember--part of what the bill of rites asks for is a model contract and so, if this is just specific Toko commercial hiring groups, can you tell me how they overlap or if there is harmony there with the request for the domestic workers--standards board to come up with a model contract for us is--is that an area",85,,
532,0.97,3662.992,3669.065,I think that's out of the scope of this particular bill.,86,,
533,0.97,3669.065,3675.505,Though I--I think that we should definitely work on the recommendations.,86,,
534,0.97,3675.505,3704.534,This bill is not--as we have scoped it not intended to define what a model contract is but just require that will be advance notice before contracting of what the--the expectations are as well as transparency at time of payment on how those expectations were filled.,86,,
535,0.97,3704.534,3709.472,Creating what the expectations are it's in a model contract.,86,,
536,0.97,3709.472,3711.908,You go beyond that transparency piece.,86,,
537,0.97,3711.908,3715.044,Anything to add to that,87,,
538,0.97,3715.044,3716.279,I don't think so.,88,,
539,0.97,3716.279,3720.283,This is--it's a Precontract situation.,88,,
540,0.97,3720.283,3724.987,As drafted this legislation is not requiring a contract.,88,,
541,0.97,3724.987,3743.773,"However, in the context of the presumption which is used for enforcement when a contractor begins working for a business then if there is a Precontract disclosure provided it turns in to a contract so there is--different ways of thinking about it.",88,,
542,0.97,3743.773,3748.578,This legislation doesn't require a contract with in the context of enforcement.,88,,
543,0.97,3748.578,3753.85,This disclosure can become a contract.,88,,
544,0.97,3753.85,3754.217,So to speak.,88,,
545,0.97,3754.217,3774.871,"Thinking about how common law contracts work and then other situations separate from enforcing law a court may decide that may Precontract disclosure, when a worker begins Preforming work that Precontract disclosure may be part of the C. in the context that have law it's not requiring contract at the outset.",88,,
546,0.97,3774.871,3779.208,Thank you for that.,89,,
547,0.97,3779.208,3782.445,I'm not seeing any more questions of the Onset here.,89,,
548,0.97,3782.445,3788.885,Let's go head and move onto issue identification.,89,,
549,0.97,3788.885,3791.487,Okay.,90,,
550,0.97,3791.487,3793.789,I will move forward it's a nice transition.,90,,
551,0.97,3793.789,3797.193,I said this law doesn't require a written contract.,90,,
552,0.97,3797.193,3809.572,One issue to consider is in this law include a requirement for a written contract instead of a Precontract December closure there are Prosxcons to both types of requirements.,90,,
553,0.97,3809.572,3815.411,I think it may be helpful to try to benefit the written contract.,90,,
554,0.97,3815.411,3822.151,It is something that is required as a previously mentioned by New York City and Minneapolis.,90,,
555,0.97,3822.151,3844.54,Their law that protect free Lancers and the benefits of a written contract are that it can represent more of a meeting of the minds between parties because it's requiring participation by both the business and the contractor rather than one party presenting an offer that then by default may be part of a contract.,90,,
556,0.97,3844.54,3855.284,"It is a--a written contract, legally enforceable document so, there wouldn't need to be this rebut Contributal it.",90,,
557,0.97,3855.284,3859.956,Would be a legally binding document that the court of law would honor.,90,,
558,0.97,3859.956,3871.167,They are--of course there may be disagreements did the work confirm to the contract and those sorts of things but a written contract is the legally binding agreement.,90,,
559,0.97,3871.167,3881.944,The downside is that it--requiring written contract would limit the flexibility of entering in to verbal contracts.,90,,
560,0.97,3881.944,3887.216,I want to hire you to do X in my business and that is done.,90,,
561,0.97,3887.216,3899.195,Even with in the context of the legislation as it's currently drafted the ability to engage in oral contracts is diminished because there needs to be a written Precontract disclosure.,90,,
562,0.97,3899.195,3900.496,That is something to consider.,90,,
563,0.97,3900.496,3907.937,It can be changed by an oral agreement so that does give flexibility.,90,,
564,0.97,3907.937,3916.479,This legislation requires something written with the beginning of any agreement to work between a business and a contractor.,90,,
565,0.97,3916.479,3917.78,"We also heard, Yeah,.",90,,
566,0.97,3917.78,3921.35,I'm confused a little bit.,91,,
567,0.97,3921.35,3930.66,"I thought that the way we structured was the Precontract disclosure, that in he is sense becomes the extra",91,,
568,0.97,3930.66,3933.829,There is different ways of structuring.,92,,
569,0.97,3933.829,3943.172,The way it's written right now is that the rebuttal dose into effect in the context of enforcement.,92,,
570,0.97,3943.172,3951.881,It could be written differently if--to have a Precontract disclosure become a contract when the contractor begins work.,92,,
571,0.97,3951.881,3964.86,That would be a different drafting decision that would have a different outcome and that is something that can be considered as well.,92,,
572,0.97,3964.86,3987.316,I just--I'm just thinking sort of--the Rebuttable presumption aside I was under the impression that by merit of there being a Precontract disclosure and then work done under that Precontract disclosure that makes the Precontract disclosure a contract.,93,,
573,0.97,3987.316,3989.018,That's--if high level.,93,,
574,0.97,3989.018,3996.592,That's what they thought the purpose of the Precontract disclosure was.,93,,
575,0.97,3996.592,4005.501,That in itself--becomes the expectations for what the benefits are associate with the work.,93,,
576,0.97,4005.501,4012.641,I want to speak carefully because this isn't my--contract law is not my area of experience.,94,,
577,0.97,4012.641,4030.092,"My sense is if there were dispute about a Precontract disclosure absence this--that a court would take the Precontract disclosure under consideration for thinking--for deciding on what the terms were perhaps there could be other considerations also, written contract.",94,,
578,0.97,4030.092,4035.731,I don't know to what extent an oral agreement would factor into that situation.,94,,
579,0.97,4035.731,4052.681,If it's--if the law says clearly that a Precontract disclosure is the contract that will have a greater legal authority than not saying that.,94,,
580,0.97,4052.681,4053.249,Thank you.,95,,
581,0.97,4053.249,4073.569,"A concern about a written contract and I think this is something that--we heard earlier in the presentation today is that some contractors may not feel comfortable entering in to a written contract where they would need to sign their name, fear of retaliation, fear of creating a paper trail for the work arrangement.",96,,
582,0.97,4073.569,4077.807,That's something to consider as well.,96,,
583,0.97,4077.807,4081.31,Thank you very much.,97,,
584,0.97,4081.31,4085.815,"So, just want to have a better sense of what the process is here.",97,,
585,0.97,4085.815,4096.892,"This is draft legislation, right I believe the main sponsor is asking in questions and the questions that were discussing it for today.",97,,
586,0.97,4096.892,4109.672,These are--daylight some potential items to flag for possible inclusion into a bill for production.,97,,
587,0.97,4109.672,4109.872,Okay.,97,,
588,0.97,4109.872,4113.709,Appreciate the--the--additional work that may go into the item.,97,,
589,0.97,4113.709,4123.752,I want to flag for folks what may--who weren't part of the wage theft ordinance in the past.,97,,
590,0.97,4123.752,4127.089,I wasn't here when that in Orderrance passed.,97,,
591,0.97,4127.089,4146.075,We know that many of the barriers to enforcement of the wage theft ordinance came in the form of workers being told that they weren't going to get paid and not paid the amount they were originally told.,97,,
592,0.97,4146.075,4163.058,"When it came time for enforcement SPD would say, where is your written paper frail there was a lot of work to try get a form, a mock form developed.",97,,
593,0.97,4163.058,4170.833,That we created a mock form that people could have to really document what they were supposed to be paid.,97,,
594,0.97,4170.833,4188.784,That instead of not having a stronger guidance on what should be provided before work begins so if there is any wage theft people understand how to use that paper trail.,97,,
595,0.97,4188.784,4198.26,Just from a basic understanding Úwant to say why this point is important to get right and that the value of having a contract of some form.,97,,
596,0.97,4198.26,4205.034,Association Councilmember Herbold I don't know if there is anything else you want to flag on this.,97,,
597,0.97,4205.034,4212.241,It sounds like this is an important piece that we get.,97,,
598,0.97,4212.241,4213.075,Okay.,97,,
599,0.97,4213.075,4213.309,Great.,97,,
600,0.97,4213.309,4213.676,Let's move on.,97,,
601,0.97,4213.676,4214.643,Okay.,98,,
602,0.97,4214.643,4218.147,The next issue is enforcement.,99,,
603,0.97,4218.147,4235.898,"It's really about the impact of the legislation on the small hiring group and so, we know that the small hiring group is limited to a small business which could be--a business with no employees, it could be a business with one or two employees.",99,,
604,0.97,4235.898,4247.276,"I think there are about 90,000 businesses registered in city of Seattle for a business license.",99,,
605,0.97,4247.276,4250.079,"I think about 40,000 of those don't have employees.",99,,
606,0.97,4250.079,4254.516,That's a lot of--in Seattle.,99,,
607,0.97,4254.516,4259.622,It would need to be significant outreach to make sure they are aware of their obligations.,99,,
608,0.97,4259.622,4267.796,All of these obligations are required for any business that has an employee and the remedies all the same.,99,,
609,0.97,4267.796,4273.168,Regardless of the size of business for businesses that do have employees.,99,,
610,0.97,4273.168,4284.58,If there is a small business--it may not be Prepped to provide something like a written contract or a payment receipt every time payment is made.,99,,
611,0.97,4284.58,4289.818,One could argue they should always prep to honor the payment.,99,,
612,0.97,4289.818,4301.163,"This next issue to think about is if there is concern, this is way too much text no they with is only have one type of hiring group covered.",99,,
613,0.97,4309.538,4319.848,If have is con certain about the impact of--perhaps the legislation can address that and a more clear way than it already does.,99,,
614,0.97,4319.848,4336.765,The legislation already gives the Ols director the ability to consider the whole range of circumstances when deciding whether or not to make a business pay up to three times the amount owed whether or not to make the business pay penalties or fines.,99,,
615,0.97,4336.765,4341.77,The director already has that discretion and can consider a range of things.,99,,
616,0.97,4341.77,4342.838,The size the business.,99,,
617,0.97,4342.838,4348.377,"The extent of human resources, was it just a mistake, et cetera.",99,,
618,0.97,4348.377,4383.512,"There could be an interest in requiring Ols to maybe not impose fines or damages for first violation by a small business, that could be part of the legislation in small business would need to be defined in some way or relegated to rule making or just the legislation could be left as is and the and the--and the director has the discretion to make the determinations in the context of the investigation.",99,,
619,0.97,4383.512,4383.879,I will--oops.,99,,
620,0.97,4383.879,4392.721,Try to take out some of that text so you could read it but it looks like I'm not able to do that while screen sharing.,99,,
621,0.97,4392.721,4398.994,It would effectively--the language you would want to take out.,100,,
622,0.97,4398.994,4424.586,With that be B and D because that have issue has been addressed with Councilmember Herbold's commitment to remove it may not be necessary because the director already has the discretion to all of this.,100,,
623,0.97,4447.209,4447.576,.,100,,
624,0.97,4447.876,4451.613,"Yeah, a and C. two options.",101,,
625,0.97,4451.613,4453.081,Simple ones.,101,,
626,0.97,4453.081,4468.597,"I will NOTE Councilmembers, that there is shall a concern I'm having about the size of the employer, right and if it's one individual you--even mentioned an individual who may not have any employees.",102,,
627,0.97,4468.597,4477.606,If they are doing the hiring that makes many makes me concerned about the administrative burden that's being proposed.,102,,
628,0.97,4477.606,4484.546,I would be interested in looking at a different threshold and want to flag that.,102,,
629,0.97,4484.546,4497.96,The other thing--we didn't spend I--but maybe the prime sponsor or any definition information you that can share with us.,102,,
630,0.97,4497.96,4501.83,I'm concerned about the scope of work.,102,,
631,0.97,4501.83,4510.539,If an individual is hiring a computer Tech who is an independent contractor to do some work for an hour or two.,102,,
632,0.97,4510.539,4520.916,Does that one individual then have to have a credit for an hour's work I'm looking at the size of the employer and the scope of the work that's done.,102,,
633,0.97,4520.916,4530.959,I wanted to flag those two issues as something I would be interested in having a little more discussion about.,102,,
634,0.97,4530.959,4531.36,Yeah.,103,,
635,0.97,4531.36,4550.546,This law would require a prosecute contract Precontract disclosure if there was an Ongoin relationship between the business and the computer Tech there wouldn't need to be a new prosecute contract disclosure issued each time.,103,,
636,0.97,4550.546,4560.856,There could be an approach of think about it like a master Precontract disclosure provided for the first time that they worked together.,103,,
637,0.97,4560.856,4580.709,"Then if they continue to work together, could you do another two hours, three hours it could be as simple as the small business writing three hours of work at $50A Unhour, payment will be at the--and there wouldn't need to be a full sale reissue of the Precontract disclosure.",103,,
638,0.97,4580.709,4586.582,It could just be for the parts that changed.,103,,
639,0.97,4586.582,4593.388,Can you remind me what the Lsac recommendations were on this topic,104,,
640,0.97,4593.388,4601.196,Lsac recommendations were for two types of hiring groups.,105,,
641,0.97,4601.196,4602.831,One was for--employees.,105,,
642,0.97,4602.831,4603.231,Many Soare.,106,,
643,0.97,4603.231,4605.033,You cut out for a second.,106,,
644,0.97,4605.033,4607.703,One--there were two types.,106,,
645,0.97,4607.703,4622.351,One was for business that had one or more employees and then the other was for a business that had five or more independent contractors that they hired on the consistent basis.,106,,
646,0.97,4622.351,4636.365,"Something to think about, those kinds of recommendations is that it may Únot be immediately obvious to the contractor or even to the hiring group for the--the second definition on whether or not they covered.",106,,
647,0.97,4636.365,4641.236,Whether or not that hiring and hiring group as Abhijit employee.,106,,
648,0.97,4641.236,4648.844,They may not know especially if they are working at the place of business they wouldn't know how many contractors they hire consistently.,106,,
649,0.97,4648.844,4657.552,Unless it's a very large contractor like a large--like a food delivery business.,106,,
650,0.97,4657.552,4661.623,"If that situation contractors will know, yes, this business is covered.",106,,
651,0.97,4661.623,4682.911,Something to think about if there will--were to be a different threshold for coverage of hiring groups is how would a contractor know that business is covered.,106,,
652,0.97,4682.911,4694.089,"That's why, again, we had--for the previous meeting we had prepared like a decision agenda to back through the different options.",107,,
653,0.97,4694.089,4702.464,Since we did not have the opportunity to do that the last meeting we have tried to answer some of these questions.,107,,
654,0.97,4702.464,4714.242,"Because the rights contained in this bill in order to--for them to be exercised, the contract workers have to know whether or not they are eligible.",107,,
655,0.97,4714.242,4719.114,We felt that--I felt--and I gave Karina some direction.,107,,
656,0.97,4719.114,4722.851,I'm open to talk about different contours we may put on this eligibility.,107,,
657,0.97,4722.851,4743.738,We felt that it was just unworkable to have a standard that may be Unknowable by the contract worker be the standard for which the application of the rights be based on.,107,,
658,0.97,4743.738,4769.965,I think that's--potentially is a separate issue than the issue that you are raising chair Mosqueda that I'm happy to work with you on as it relates to sort of more of the one off engagements that may happen and how we want to address that through these options or other options that we may consider.,107,,
659,0.97,4769.965,4772.801,I appreciate that.,108,,
660,0.97,4772.801,4777.706,Thank you Councilmember Herbold and Ka Rina for that.,108,,
661,0.97,4777.706,4779.307,Let's do that.,108,,
662,0.97,4779.307,4779.674,Let's do that.,108,,
663,0.97,4779.674,4783.912,An idea that was mentioned in the previous memo was a value of services.,109,,
664,0.97,4783.912,4789.484,I don't know if this would address all the situations that you are mentioning.,109,,
665,0.97,4789.484,4807.536,"If there was a threshold value, the $600 whether Perrin stance or over the course of the year that could be one way to limit the one offs that if it's a--expense every situation it may not address that particular agreement but that is one idea.",109,,
666,0.97,4807.536,4807.802,Okay.,110,,
667,0.97,4807.802,4814.643,We will do some follow up conversations then about employee threshold.,110,,
668,0.97,4814.643,4825.887,"Perhaps the scope or duration of the work or, and, the value of that work if--okay.",110,,
669,0.97,4825.887,4826.087,Okay.,110,,
670,0.97,4826.087,4826.421,Sounds good.,110,,
671,0.97,4826.421,4827.022,Thank you.,111,,
672,0.97,4827.022,4843.672,I Andly be interested as well in running some situations by--Columbia legal service who are sort of my go Toos on independent contractor issues that we have worked on in the past at the state level.,112,,
673,0.97,4843.672,4848.276,They had huge wins this year.,112,,
674,0.97,4848.276,4848.777,"Triple damages, Yeah.",112,,
675,0.97,4848.777,4852.28,It's--it's great to have these early conversations appreciate that.,112,,
676,0.97,4852.28,4861.79,I did want to flag those two Cobb Certains and thank you for adding in the value of services as another option to look at.,112,,
677,0.97,4861.79,4863.859,Please go head.,113,,
678,0.97,4863.859,4868.23,The third issue is effective dates.,114,,
679,0.97,4868.23,4878.006,The current effective date is March first of next year which would give office labor standards nine months to prepare for implementation.,114,,
680,0.97,4878.006,4886.014,They mean office of labor Standrds indicated a full year would be helpful for them.,114,,
681,0.97,4886.014,4898.627,Since the legislation requires Ols to prepare a number of model and template documents including translation and of course outreach is so important for this kind of legislation as well.,114,,
682,0.97,4898.627,4907.469,Something to consider is that the effective date could be changed to one hear to allow for more implementation.,114,,
683,0.97,4907.469,4913.842,It could not identity a date by say one year passage.,114,,
684,0.97,4913.842,4924.653,It does provide nine months and that would be March first.,114,,
685,0.97,4924.653,4927.422,Any comments on that all right.,114,,
686,0.97,4927.422,4932.127,"As far as next steps, my understanding.",114,,
687,0.97,4932.127,4936.331,The introduction and referral is may 10th.,114,,
688,0.97,4936.331,4939.634,Is that right is it may 17th,114,,
689,0.97,4939.634,4949.477,I think we should continue to aim for May 10th with the understanding that we may need to make adjustments.,115,,
690,0.97,4949.477,4949.844,Understood.,116,,
691,0.97,4949.844,4959.621,And then the next discussion of the legislation would be may 18th which is the next Finance and housing committee.,116,,
692,0.97,4959.621,4959.821,Okay.,116,,
693,0.97,4959.821,4961.89,Thank you so much.,116,,
694,0.97,4961.89,4965.56,And a Councilmember Herbold thank you for your flexibility in the last meeting.,116,,
695,0.97,4965.56,4973.201,I hope that allowed for some extra time to come one some of these alternative solutions that you have been proposing today.,116,,
696,0.97,4973.201,4977.806,Probably not the ideal but thank you for your flexibility.,116,,
697,0.97,4977.806,4989.551,The one thing on Timeline bare that I didn't see is--in the presentation--I can't remember what slide it was.,116,,
698,0.97,4991.119,4991.252,.,116,,
699,0.97,4991.252,4997.025,There was a commitment to continuing to do work.,117,,
700,0.97,5013.842,5013.975,.,117,,
701,0.97,5013.975,5020.682,And to consider this before the budget D Deliberatations.,118,,
702,0.97,5020.682,5022.65,We know this is an ongoing desire.,118,,
703,0.97,5022.65,5095.757,"[Captioners Transitioning] minimum can't inflation compensation in this bill because it was determined that not only is it out of scope with this bill but the Universes of people covered under this bill versus the minimum compensation campaign requirements or requests would be different Universes of contract workers and they couldn't both be covered under this bill so, Yeah, we work with them on the language that you see included in the bill itself and hope that, with @ passage, we can use this language to hold ourselves accountable.",118,,
704,0.97,5095.757,5113.241,Right and I have talked about it and folks know our committee after Finance and housing that usually labor issues are pretty packed this summer with all of the discussions.,119,,
705,0.97,5113.241,5120.315,We also have the domestic worker standard board recommendations you heard coming up.,119,,
706,0.97,5120.315,5148.576,"We had some labor standards legislation that was Teed up for discussion for this summer as well that I think we will put on hold for right now so I'm always excited about new labor standards discussions but would love to know a little bit more or work with you, chair Mosqueda if there are other discussions you're having about @ the Timeline or possible process because we definitely have a full plate here so is there anything else you would like to add for context?",119,,
707,0.97,5148.576,5174.802,"Just that in Washington, they included in their recommended language an assumption that the legislation would come to your Committee, we would strip that leg which are based on my conversations with you.",120,,
708,0.97,5174.802,5178.907,"Chair Mosqueda, we would need to find another home, potentially, my Committee for those sessions.",120,,
709,0.97,5178.907,5179.607,Appreciate that recommendation.,120,,
710,0.97,5179.607,5185.313,Are there any additional comments on this?,120,,
711,0.97,5185.313,5191.119,Or questions?,120,,
712,0.97,5191.119,5213.041,"The question that I would have, since there are a number of changes, especially related to domestic workers component is, is there a draft deadline that you are hoping to meet, Karina?",121,,
713,0.97,5213.041,5221.749,I know we said the goal of introduction by May 10th but I would love to try to share some additional information with the two organizations I mentioned and I am sure that folks may want to weigh in as well.,121,,
714,0.97,5221.749,5227.722,Is there a deadline that we are hoping to have revised draft available for other Stakeholders to take a look at?,121,,
715,0.97,5227.722,5242.77,"Okay, well I am hearing two things so one is the deadline to let me know about proposed changes that I would hear about from Council member Herbnold.",122,,
716,0.97,5242.77,5248.509,I would need for a may 10th introduction and would need to know about that by the end of today.,122,,
717,0.97,5248.509,5270.598,"With the draft, in order for those changes to be made and [Indiscernibleãmuffled] if you are seeking a draft that removes domestic workers, I can provide that in an hour or so because that is just a matter of removing language and I can give you a changes version or clean version or both.",122,,
718,0.97,5270.598,5288.149,"As far as revisions, I would need it by the end of the day and of course it would still be an opportunity to move to amend the legislation on May 18th and, depending on how many things might happen between now and the 18th, maybe a substitute built that is for Council member Herbnold to let me know.",122,,
719,0.97,5291.252,5306.734,Council member Herbold what it be expect acceptable for you as the plan sponsor if I requested a clean version that removes the domestic workers language so that I could see that as one and we could do some initial review of that?,123,,
720,0.97,5306.734,5308.036,"Yeah, absolutely.",124,,
721,0.97,5308.036,5316.01,"I actually, through Alice, requested that last night so that is in the works.",124,,
722,0.97,5316.01,5330.858,"And I just want to be really clear we are working, driving towards the next committee meeting, your next committee meeting based on my understanding of your demands on the agenda.",124,,
723,0.97,5330.858,5355.483,"If you are not planning--if may 18th is not the only other committee meeting that you have available but you have available a subsequent committee meeting in June which I did not think was the case, that would all affect the Timeline and in a way that would allow for more time.",124,,
724,0.97,5355.483,5360.688,But I was under the impression that may 18th was our last shot.,124,,
725,0.97,5360.688,5369.63,We do have a time crunch in those June meetings but appreciate that.,125,,
726,0.97,5369.63,5389.484,"I just wanted to double check since we got the benefit of our counsel present with us as well as the staff so if there were introduction and referral on the 10th is a post of the 17th, we could still hear that meeting on the 18th in line with the appropriate protocols.",125,,
727,0.97,5389.484,5389.917,Is that correct?,125,,
728,0.97,5389.917,5390.785,That is correct.,126,,
729,0.97,5390.785,5394.689,There would be less time to look at it before the meeting but that is absolutely an option.,127,,
730,0.97,5394.689,5395.289,"Okay, great.",128,,
731,0.97,5395.289,5397.592,"Well, I definitely don't want to slow down the discussions.",128,,
732,0.97,5397.592,5426.454,"I think that getting that Stakeholder feedback is important but I think that having a little bit more time, especially for the review of the initial draft before introduction, if that is your desire, to try to get as much feedback as possible, that @ could get us another week, council member Herbold and we could keep having conversations about those June dates as well because I think it is really important.",128,,
733,0.97,5426.454,5435.63,"If June gets appropriately amended prior to introduction, let me know if there is feedback you want to incorporate during deliberations.",128,,
734,0.97,5435.63,5437.298,And we will make time for that as well.,128,,
735,0.97,5437.665,5459.02,"Okay so I'm hearing possible introduction then on the 17th and thank you, Karina for all the work you have done but also stripping out the language on domestic workers so we can share around the more recent draft.",129,,
736,0.97,5459.02,5488.483,"The things that I will flag that I don't think I will have the ability to provide feedback on today which is why I'm hoping that with an extra week at least we will have a better chance to have discussions to sponsor and others around the size of the employer, I'm sorry, the size of the employer or hiring entity, the size and scope of the work being done by the independent contractor, and potentially the value of the services.",129,,
737,0.97,5488.483,5496.49,"I'm a little concerned about that September date but since it might not be coming to my Committee, that's good for me to shelf.",129,,
738,0.97,5496.49,5501.229,I know there is a lot of work going on right now.,129,,
739,0.97,5501.229,5504.599,So thank you for putting this slide up.,129,,
740,0.97,5504.599,5505.399,Any additional--?,129,,
741,0.97,5505.399,5540.067,"I just really want to urge us to off-line, I'm not sure this is the proper Venue to have this discussion about sort of the finer details of the process and introduction and parliamentary procedure but I would ask, I know that Council member Herbold's staff is communicating with my office as it relates to those issues but I would like to make sure we are balancing several important interests as we are talking about these deadlines for introduction and Whatnot.",130,,
742,0.97,5540.067,5556.183,"There is obviously the need to make sure that committee members have enough time with whatever draft bill is introduced but also, I really value the importance of making sure that legislation is published and Viewable by the public.",130,,
743,0.97,5556.183,5590.885,With enough time for them to also be engaged with public comment and the ongoing legislative process so I don't want folks who are interested in the subject in terms of Stakeholders to feel like they are jammed and I also don't want committee members and other Councilmembers to feel like they are getting jammed as a result of a Timeline or a deadline that we are discussing here so I like to just have the benefit of a little more time before we commit on the record to specific deadlines.,130,,
744,0.97,5590.885,5595.59,On what an appropriate sequence of introduction and celebration and consideration could be.,130,,
745,0.97,5595.59,5608.736,I will flag that I think the September intent language here is rather ambitious and overly optimistic and I understand why it is there.,130,,
746,0.97,5608.736,5613.708,I appreciate the energy and the intent as to why it is there.,130,,
747,0.97,5613.708,5663.29,"But I also want to be really transparent that I am concerned that it will--it could sort of resulting undue pressure on the system and in terms of getting this legislation heard in a committee that is otherwise very crowded . You know, all due respect, council member Herbold, your Committee is also very crowded, very busy with oftentimes four hour hearings so I'm a little worried that we are being overly ambitious and as a result, inadvertently communicating to Stakeholders that we are capable of actually getting this across the finish line in the summer and don't want to create any undue expectations amongst our partners in committee and our Stakeholders.",130,,
748,0.97,5663.29,5687.681,So I just want us to be very cautious about those kinds of commitments now . My understanding is there is a lot of Stakeholder--that needs to happen and we have a very full agenda so I just want to be sort of realistic with our capacity realities as it relates to that particular Timeline as well.,130,,
749,0.97,5687.681,5689.216,Thank you very much.,131,,
750,0.97,5689.216,5693.22,Those points underscore the concerns I have as well.,131,,
751,0.97,5693.22,5701.629,So I think it is a point well taken.,131,,
752,0.97,5701.629,5722.149,"Speaking of undue pressure, I want to make sure we are not providing undue pressure for this legislation especially the scope and nature of it for domestic workers, having Stakeholder conversations that are necessary and the ones I want to have in addition to the ones that I know folks want to have on their own and amongst Councilmembers in our deliberations.",131,,
753,0.97,5722.149,5734.829,"Right now, I will say we do have a lot of interest in making sure this that's right and we will be working with other Councilmembers to offer time in our June meetings if necessary.",131,,
754,0.97,5734.829,5738.766,"So for some that feel there is a pressure to move this on May 18th, noted in the slide.",131,,
755,0.97,5738.766,5757.151,I know there was an initial Timeline but we also did not have a chance to walk through this at our last meeting so that makes some sense and we will keep the conversations going to make sure we get this right and that there is not undue pressure which is due to--committee dates.,131,,
756,0.97,5757.151,5767.695,"Thank you very much, Councilmembers and thank you for your comments just now.",131,,
757,0.97,5767.695,5771.198,"Council member Herbold, is there anything else you would like to add?",131,,
758,0.97,5771.198,5775.302,"Karina, is there anything else you would like to add?",132,,
759,0.97,5775.302,5776.77,"No, thank you very much.",133,,
760,0.97,5776.77,5785.813,I'm not seeing any other additional counsel comments.,133,,
761,0.97,5785.813,5788.315,"I want to thank you, Karina for your work on this.",134,,
762,0.97,5788.315,5804.131,"I know you have been spending a lot of time going through these details and will continue to do that with us so thank you for your research and the Deliberative process you have gone through to provide this draft for us and Committee member Strauss doubles Council @ member Herbold, as we seek for additional Stakeholder discussion.",134,,
763,0.97,5804.131,5807.735,Wonderful.,134,,
764,0.97,5807.735,5812.039,To be continued and no undue pressure for Timeline so more to come.,134,,
765,0.97,5812.039,5812.84,"Thank you, Karina.",134,,
766,0.97,5812.84,5814.708,Let's move on to our last item of business.,134,,
767,0.97,5814.708,5818.412,That is the sound transit property transfer item number nine.,134,,
768,0.97,5818.412,5821.815,Madam clerk will you please read item number nine into the record?,134,,
769,0.97,5821.815,5829.456,"Item number nine, consul--129957.",135,,
770,0.97,5829.456,5843.971,"-- an ordinance relating to the office of housing (Oh); authorizing the acceptance of a transfer of real property in Southeast Seattle for the purpose of development of affordable housing and other related uses, and for general municipal purposes; placing the property under the jurisdiction of Oh; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",135,,
771,0.97,5843.971,5848.742,"Madam clerk, it was a little hard to hear you but I know folks have the agenda in front of them.",136,,
772,0.97,5848.742,5856.183,"This is the sound transit property transfer, counsel bill 120058 record.",136,,
773,0.97,5856.183,5856.584,Wonderful.,136,,
774,0.97,5856.584,5861.989,Thank you very much for being here with us.,136,,
775,0.97,5861.989,5869.597,"Please see director Alvarado from the office of housing, Erica Malone also from the office of housing,--red cliff from--, thank you all for being with us here today.",136,,
776,0.97,5869.597,5881.008,"Council members, this item is for consideration of the property transfer from sound transit to the office of housing.",136,,
777,0.97,5881.008,5894.722,"If you haven't had a chance to hear about this from a way to just, it is an exciting opportunity, notable in a number of ways and I don't want to totally steal from the presentation about to happen so I will name a few.",136,,
778,0.97,5894.722,5903.23,This is truly about following through on our city's effort to not let go of public land that can be used for public good so the city is accepting this land at no cost.,136,,
779,0.97,5903.23,5917.278,That land is located in the South land in response to community for affordable housing and the South land will be billed for purchase meaning we are providing accessible homeownership opportunities for Seattle residents.,136,,
780,0.97,5917.278,5942.269,"Three really important points to lift up and part of our long- standing commitments to not only address the issues that are leading to displacement but also leading to more home opportunities, that helps poverty issues and reduces long commutes that are bad for our health and the planet's health by pushing more people out of the city so this is really exciting and it cost.",136,,
781,0.97,5942.269,5947.675,I'm going to turn it over to Tracy Ratcliff to walk us through initial comments.,136,,
782,0.97,5947.675,5969.897,"Council member, you, Tracy Ratcliff have done a great job of laying the foundation for a way to just's hesitation and I will let them go through with that presentation to talk about Doubleãvery exciting proposition here so very excited to help Emily and her crew go through the legislation for you.",136,,
783,0.97,5969.897,5976.837,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda and members of the committee.",137,,
784,0.97,5976.837,5978.138,I'm really excited to present today.,137,,
785,0.97,5978.138,5991.385,"This is legislation that will formally accept surplus property from sound transit, put it in the office of housing's jurisdiction so that we can turn it into permanently affordable homeownership in the Ranier valley.",137,,
786,0.97,5991.385,6015.943,The vote will mark really the end of a several year process and this process included significant coordination between the office of housing and sound transit . Thanks very much to the sound transit team D staff included a entire Trinity engagement process to get to this point.,137,,
787,0.97,6015.943,6025.986,It included a formal petition to the FTA to use a Little- known Federal regulation that allows us to accept these properties at no cost for public use.,137,,
788,0.97,6025.986,6037.331,It included identification by the city of significant resources to use to invest in the development of these permanently affordable homes and it included a formal vote by the sound transit board to send these properties to us.,137,,
789,0.97,6037.331,6053.18,"But I also think that it marks the beginning of something really big and that is that we are are going to convert vacant, fenced off land in the Ranier Valley to community use.",137,,
790,0.97,6053.18,6097.324,"We are going to do so in a neighborhood that is experiencing displacement and to finance and housing Committee--chair Mosqueda this point, we are going to bring the benefit of home ownership to a number of families and I hope in doing so we can help prove displacement is not an inevitable so long as we make intentional Proactive investments in equitable permanent solutions and so I'm going to turn it over to Erica Malone who is our homeownership specialist at the office of housing and who we are really lucky to have because she is an expert in permanently affordable homeownership to walk us through this presentation.",137,,
791,0.97,6097.324,6098.192,"Thank you, Emily.",138,,
792,0.97,6098.192,6099.827,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",138,,
793,0.97,6099.827,6101.895,"Thank you, Councilmembers and Tracy.",138,,
794,0.97,6101.895,6108.335,Let's see if my--if I can advance the slides.,138,,
795,0.97,6108.335,6116.51,"You know, it worked before when we tried this.",138,,
796,0.97,6116.51,6118.545,"One moment, please.",138,,
797,0.97,6118.545,6121.949,Apologies.,138,,
798,0.97,6124.751,6126.353,No apology necessary.,139,,
799,0.97,6126.353,6128.655,Oh.,140,,
800,0.97,6128.655,6130.757,We are all used to do this now.,141,,
801,0.97,6138.298,6139.233,And there we go.,142,,
802,0.97,6139.233,6140.267,Can you all see that?,142,,
803,0.97,6140.267,6144.571,"Yes, your entire screen is showing so you might want to hit that green button to make it maximum.",143,,
804,0.97,6144.571,6145.372,Thank you.,144,,
805,0.97,6145.372,6146.173,Great.,144,,
806,0.97,6146.173,6150.177,Great tip . are we good?,144,,
807,0.97,6150.177,6150.577,Yes.,145,,
808,0.97,6150.577,6151.578,Got my goodness.,146,,
809,0.97,6151.578,6172.9,"That was--Emily really set it up well . In calls from Trinity, for not only activating surplus sites and for more affordable housing, permanently affordable homeownership is what we are proposing on these sites.",146,,
810,0.97,6172.9,6200.694,"Building on a really successful partnership with sound transit, several large-scale multifamily developments, as you all know about on Capitol Hill, it goes about building on that relationship . We Collaboratively brought forth this other path that we will utilize some of the smaller sites for affordable homeownership opportunities.",146,,
811,0.97,6200.694,6223.35,"This is in line with sound transit's transit oriented goals, obviously, Rcw 81 112- 350, the 8080 rule and advances the city schools of providing more affordable homeownership and as Emily mentioned, specifically in a neighborhood under really significant justification pressure and for community Residentswho are under threat of displacement.",146,,
812,0.97,6223.35,6232.659,"Erica, do you want to, for the benefit of the public, remind us the 8080 80 rule which we modeled our policy off as well?",147,,
813,0.97,6232.659,6233.46,Yes.,148,,
814,0.97,6233.46,6253.68,So 80% of the surplus property that is identified by sound transit must go to tenants or homeowners with incomes of 80% or below of area median income.,148,,
815,0.97,6253.68,6256.984,That is two of the 80s.,148,,
816,0.97,6256.984,6258.652,That always stumps me.,148,,
817,0.97,6258.652,6285.078,"So the general concept is that sound transit needs to offer properties at least 80% of their companies to eligible entities to create affordable housing and we have really established as Erica mentioned, a good partnership with them to make sure that where they are able to surplus property and avail it, we have the resources and the ability to take advantage of that.",149,,
818,0.97,6285.078,6288.715,Thank you.,150,,
819,0.97,6288.715,6289.049,Yes.,150,,
820,0.97,6289.049,6298.492,"So as Emily mentioned earlier, too, the property being transferred at no cost really is an exciting piece of this.",150,,
821,0.97,6298.492,6320.547,"There are two levels of discount . sound transit agreeing to forgo the one Million-Dollar--excuse me, the roughly $12 million property value as well as the Federal transit administration that is willing to forgo their interest of roughly $4 million.",150,,
822,0.97,6320.547,6350.744,"Before we get too far into the weeds, where are these properties? there is a property list in the legislation but sort of a birds eye view, Mount Baker station in the upper left there and just outside of the slide there on the right side is the Ranier Beach station so clustered around Columbia city station near our Cello and Ranier Beach station.",150,,
823,0.97,6350.744,6353.046,"The sites range from 2500 square feet to 10,000 square feet.",150,,
824,0.97,6353.046,6353.947,They are all flat.,150,,
825,0.97,6353.947,6355.048,They are fenced.,150,,
826,0.97,6355.048,6356.283,They are Graveled.,150,,
827,0.97,6356.283,6357.084,You have seen them.,150,,
828,0.97,6357.084,6366.46,They will be activated soon and be fulfilling community's vision for homeownership and community needs.,150,,
829,0.97,6366.46,6373.9,So a quick Repack Recap as to where we have come to date.,150,,
830,0.97,6373.9,6382.275,"Identification of the properties, as Emily mentioned, to a fairly robust, equitable community engagement process to take place the summer of 2019.",150,,
831,0.97,6382.275,6388.081,"Fda approval to allow the transfer at no cost, happening in September.",150,,
832,0.97,6388.081,6391.318,Transit approved board approval which we are grateful for.,150,,
833,0.97,6391.318,6398.592,"As well as for the TOD staff, their partnership has been incredible.",150,,
834,0.97,6398.592,6407.0,Transfer agreement was executed in April and now is time to accept the properties.,150,,
835,0.97,6407.0,6415.008,"Primary terms of the transfer agreement, we will be doing additional due diligence.",150,,
836,0.97,6415.008,6426.62,And there are certain Timelines and milestones in terms of when requests for proposals need to be published.,150,,
837,0.97,6426.62,6428.255,There will be no fewer than 100 homes developed.,150,,
838,0.97,6428.255,6431.324,There is likely the potential for more.,150,,
839,0.97,6431.324,6436.463,We are helpful that could be upwards of 150 or more.,150,,
840,0.97,6436.463,6454.881,"But we wanted to give space for community to be engaged in terms of our they bigger units, which would result potentially in fewer units and that it is not just maybe a unit count but a number of people served count that is more appropriate as a measure.",150,,
841,0.97,6454.881,6462.088,So just a quick reminder and I know you all know this.,150,,
842,0.97,6462.088,6465.892,What we mean by permanently affordable homeownership is that homes are affordable not just to the first homebuyer.,150,,
843,0.97,6465.892,6481.007,"Although they are affordable to the first homebuyer, and then when or if that home owner chooses to sell, they do so at a price this is affordable to the next homebuyer.",150,,
844,0.97,6481.007,6511.938,"Taking into consideration the equity growth not just for the first homebuyer but for generations to come so we think this is a Supermodel generally and particularly in a place where displacement is happening so quickly, this will allow for homes to always be affordable for residents of the--valley.",150,,
845,0.97,6511.938,6534.327,"A note, then, in regard to past community engagement as well as our future engagement going forward, as we move forward, as you noticed, and I forgot to mention, within three months of the transfer being made, we will need to release an rf be.",150,,
846,0.97,6534.327,6563.957,That Rfp process will be to essentially enact the vision of community as engaged with--solutions network which is a national consultant expert and community expert as well as permanently affordable homeownership and Puget sound Sage which is a local organization that has deep roots and great trust in community.,150,,
847,0.97,6563.957,6567.794,And we are really looking forward to this process.,150,,
848,0.97,6567.794,6575.035,This will determine not only what gets built but by home and for whom.,150,,
849,0.97,6577.904,6589.783,"So broadly, the overall initiative vision is both very specific in terms of production and really quite broad in terms of impact.",151,,
850,0.97,6589.783,6612.939,"There is, of course, a significant impact of this work in terms of the number of homes that will be created for homebuyers within the valley but we also see this as sort of the foundation for organizational capacity building to be able to launch event bigger and better initiatives going forward.",151,,
851,0.97,6612.939,6621.815,And within the realm of community land ownership and affordable homeownership.,151,,
852,0.97,6621.815,6628.021,"So today, this is what we are asking of you.",151,,
853,0.97,6628.021,6634.661,To go ahead and take the legislative action that will accept the property at no cost.,151,,
854,0.97,6634.661,6653.913,"This would then satisfy the city charter requirements and we look forward to Partnering with you, working with you going forward in enacting the community vision in this initiative.",151,,
855,0.97,6653.913,6656.883,"And if eye mite, a few pieces of clarification just about this legislative action.",152,,
856,0.97,6656.883,6663.69,You have seen us before as we have turned public sites into rental housing and ownership.,152,,
857,0.97,6663.69,6677.303,"In all of those cases, before we do the actual disposition of the property, we come to you with farmer detail about how we proceeded with the Rfp, how we selected the developer and ensuring the actual outline and requirements of that disposition.",152,,
858,0.97,6677.303,6682.242,This is not allowing us to go as far as a disposition.,152,,
859,0.97,6682.242,6701.628,It is merely doing the acceptance upon which we will launch the community engagement process and then be back to counsel before any disposition is made so this is really doing the other side of the coin of what sound transit board already voted to do which is send the property to us.,152,,
860,0.97,6701.628,6712.939,"We are going to have it land with us, launch community engagement and keep you posted as we move towards an Rfp based on what we hear from the community.",152,,
861,0.97,6712.939,6731.458,Emily is correct and then they would be back after that is held in they select--for the properties will be back to get authorization to transfer those properties to those successful developers so we will see these properties back again once those processes are completed and developers have successfully selected for property development.,153,,
862,0.97,6731.458,6734.527,Thank you very much.,154,,
863,0.97,6734.527,6735.862,Very exciting opportunity here.,154,,
864,0.97,6735.862,6738.364,Any questions?,154,,
865,0.97,6738.364,6740.867,Okay.,154,,
866,0.97,6740.867,6776.803,"We are always looking for ways to expedite the process and to make this easier . I guess the flip side of that is two or three years ago we passed legislation to make it so that if you saw a piece of property that was on the private market and you needed to act quickly, you didn't have to be delayed by going through our city's process for approval, you have Preauthorization to go for it and purchase given the market that we are in here in Seattle.",154,,
867,0.97,6776.803,6781.374,"We don't want to lose this opportunity so here we are with public land, getting this at no cost from sound transit.",154,,
868,0.97,6781.374,6787.614,"We want to do all we can to make sure properties like these, as you heard our gravel and leveled and ready to build, that we build that housing Asap.",154,,
869,0.97,6787.614,6790.517,Thanks for all the work that you have done and thanks from sound transit.,154,,
870,0.97,6790.517,6796.456,Not seeing any additional comments or questions.,154,,
871,0.97,6796.456,6800.493,Everyone is excited about this opportunity so let's do everything we can to get this moving as fast as possible.,154,,
872,0.97,6800.493,6803.63,I'm of the committee recommended passage of counsel bill 120058.,154,,
873,0.97,6803.63,6805.131,Do I have a second?,154,,
874,0.97,6805.131,6806.332,Second.,155,,
875,0.97,6806.332,6807.967,Other any additional comments?,156,,
876,0.97,6807.967,6813.606,"Hearing no comments, congratulations to all at Oh and future tenants in this location.",157,,
877,0.97,6813.606,6819.445,With the clerk please call the role in the passage of bill 120058.,157,,
878,0.97,6819.445,6829.889,[roll being called],158,,
879,0.97,6832.091,6835.728,"Madam chair, that is 4 in favor and 0 oppose.",159,,
880,0.97,6835.728,6843.069,The community recommendation will be sent to the May 10th Seattle council meeting for a final vote.,160,,
881,0.97,6843.069,6844.137,Thank you very much.,160,,
882,0.97,6844.137,6855.248,"Again, to our office of housing, Erica for the presentation and Emily Aurora for your leadership at Oh.",160,,
883,0.97,6855.248,6860.286,"We are excited to move forward Tracy, always great to see you and thanks for your work on central stuff on this legislation as well.",160,,
884,0.97,6860.286,6860.587,Okay.,161,,
885,0.97,6860.587,6860.92,Wonderful.,161,,
886,0.97,6860.92,6866.593,We are at the end of our agenda for today and it is not even 1:30.,161,,
887,0.97,6866.593,6866.993,Imagine that.,161,,
888,0.97,6866.993,6876.469,So we will have plenty of time for folks to take a break and get some lunch and hopefully get well rested because we do have a couple of hearings this evening . This evening it will start at 5:30.,161,,
889,0.97,6876.469,6879.539,"As a reminder to the viewing of, you can sign up for public testimony.",161,,
890,0.97,6879.539,6894.153,"We are interested in your feedback and ideas for the Federal Covid relief dollars, the American rescue plan dollars made available about $239 million over the past two years.",161,,
891,0.97,6894.153,6902.595,The first is $190 million so we have had please three public committee meetings about this discussion and we will have a public hearing tonight just focused on your public comments.,161,,
892,0.97,6902.595,6909.936,Please do sign up for a testimony.,161,,
893,0.97,6909.936,6917.21,We would be interested in your feedback and compiling that feedback with the information we received from the last three meetings and look forward to getting those dollars out as soon as possible.,161,,
894,0.97,6917.21,6935.461,"Again, excited to continue the partnership . I know that Council President Gonzalez is on the board and Council member Herbold is a member of that local progress and many of us can be--a member as well.",161,,
895,0.97,6935.461,6964.757,Excited to continue to learn from other cities that are going through similar processes and we have now had two opportunities to present with the city of Denver and the city of Austin and Annapolis as they are looking at similar strategies to deploy their dollars so today will be an opportunity for us to combine what public hearing testimony is providing in terms of additional parties that we will put in context of what we are hearing from other cities and strategies as well.,161,,
896,0.97,6964.757,6971.664,Public testimony can be found at Seattle.Gov/ Counsell/Committees/Public- comments and we will join in at 3:30.,161,,

899,0.97,6978.004,6979.205,"With that, I see nothing else.",161,,
900,0.97,6979.205,6980.073,Have a great afternoon.,161,,
901,0.97,6980.073,6983.609,Today's meeting is adjourned.,161,,
