21,0.97,90.69,109.943,I want to come here and thank you for serving on the committee and express my thanks for all the great work they have been doing particularly around rapid implementation of the center city bike improvement.,3,,
22,0.97,110.009,113.379,But I have context I want to deliver to you.,3,,
23,0.97,113.446,120.053,Seattle has a commitment to lower vehicle commissions to 82% by 2030.,3,,
24,0.97,120.119,124.357,Between 2008 and 2016 we lowered them only 1.8%.,3,,
25,0.97,124.424,137.003,"The data that was just released by the Department of Transportation for 2018, the most recent showed an increase of 36,000 vehicles per day on our streets compared to 2017.",3,,
26,0.97,137.07,139.973,So we are not making progress on that goal.,3,,
27,0.97,140.039,146.145,And we only have less than tonight years to make it.,3,,
28,0.97,146.212,165.198,"Though more Immediatelily and just as urgent is 2019 was the deadliest year on our streets in over a decade with the vast majority of the fatalities falling on people using zero emission vehicles, their own bodies to move around the streets, pedestrians.",3,,
29,0.97,165.265,169.302,The pedestrian safety crisis is immediately and has been escalating for several years.,3,,
30,0.97,169.369,172.805,It's time to dig in and try and solve that problem.,3,,
31,0.97,172.872,174.173,That's all I came here to say.,3,,
32,0.97,174.24,177.277,Thank you so much for serving on the committee.,3,,
33,0.97,177.343,177.577,Thank you.,3,,

35,0.97,178.011,183.616,Anybody else who would like to speak from the audience?,5,,
36,0.97,183.683,185.051,"Thank you, Mr. Packer.",5,,
37,0.97,185.118,189.155,That's the end of our speakers.,5,,
38,0.97,189.222,195.228,So we will move on to the next item on the agenda.,5,,
39,0.97,195.295,200.667,We will talk about the items of business.,5,,
40,0.97,200.733,204.904,I will do a read before the clerk reads them.,5,,
41,0.97,204.971,236.002,"This also has the Department of technology that we'll be overseeing, and we are going to hear today from the 3 largest committees, so Seattle Department of transportation, Seattle city light, site public utilities and talk about what they see coming through our legislative agenda this year, and a key issue we will hear about is the Seattle before district which will expire this year.",5,,
42,0.97,236.069,242.542,"As many of you know, that is something that funds nearly all of our pothole filling budget.",5,,
43,0.97,242.609,250.717,It also is most well known for expanding transit which we need to preserve and continue to expand.,5,,
44,0.97,250.783,259.626,This is complicated by what I believe to be the harmful initiative 976 which is tied up in court right now.,5,,
45,0.97,259.692,285.485,"But we will, in talking about the transportation benefit District with Seattle city light and public utilities, and we'll probably hear about their efforts to focus on utility rates and the previous city council did approve strategic plans where there are scheduled rate increases, and we want to stay on top of that and be mindful that the lower the rates, the better.",5,,
46,0.97,285.551,292.392,So why don't we go ahead and read the first item into the record here?,5,,
47,0.97,292.458,310.276,Seattle Department of transportation overview and discussion of items of business anticipated to be heard in the transportation and utilities Committee in 2020.,6,,
48,0.97,310.343,315.448,So we'll just--we'll introduce--have you all introduce yourselves.,7,,
49,0.97,315.515,336.069,We traditionally start with our esteemed central staff member and go around to the departments.,7,,
50,0.97,336.135,336.436,Central staff.,7,,
51,0.97,336.502,336.602,Can,7,,
52,0.97,336.669,337.003,Thank you.,8,,
53,0.97,337.07,344.444,"All these items are just briefing and discussion, and we are joined by Councilmember and pro team Lisa Herbold.",8,,
54,0.97,344.51,346.679,Thank you for being here.,8,,
55,0.97,346.746,346.879,Okay.,8,,
56,0.97,346.946,353.753,So you are going to walk us through the presentation?,8,,
57,0.97,353.82,355.655,"Calvin, any introductory remarks?",8,,
58,0.97,355.722,357.023,All right.,9,,
59,0.97,357.09,358.424,"Good morning, folks.",10,,
60,0.97,358.491,359.258,Thanks for having us.,10,,
61,0.97,359.325,360.893,Great to be here.,10,,
62,0.97,360.96,367.033,We want to give a quick overview of Sdot but talking about the Seattle transportation benefit.,10,,
63,0.97,367.1,380.98,This is similar to a presentation before a previous committee but we wanted to Reprise that and use it as a context for where we see a lot of need over the course of this year.,10,,
64,0.97,381.047,381.914,Thank you.,11,,
65,0.97,381.981,396.963,I'm going to give a brief overview and turn it over to Candida and Rachel.,12,,
66,0.97,397.029,415.314,"We will start with our mission vision and value, and we spent a lot of time last year working throughout the Department to have sort of refresh this and come to a consensus on what our key functions are and how this informs our work.",12,,
67,0.97,415.381,421.187,We state every presentation with the information because it grounds what we do.,12,,
68,0.97,421.254,443.142,"So our mission is or our vision as we say is that we envision Seattle powered by transportation and today's conversation is relevant to the core values of equity and availability, and it supports the others as well.",12,,
69,0.97,443.209,447.313,We have three overview slides of Sdot as a whole.,12,,
70,0.97,447.38,469.936,"We have close to a thousand men and women who come to work every day to serve the estate of Seattle and the residents, and we deliver capital projects and small vital improvements like curb ramps and s Chools.",12,,
71,0.97,470.002,484.45,"We have a vast inventory of assets and are staffed fully, and you have seen that working on the winter weather response 24/7, and we have had crews deployed since Sunday afternoon.",12,,
72,0.97,484.517,484.75,Thank you.,12,,
73,0.97,484.817,485.751,And thank you.,13,,
74,0.97,485.818,494.06,"Just to highlight that point in my opinion, the response from the city has been excellent during these snowstorms.",13,,
75,0.97,494.126,511.377,"I know that, you know, the Mayor has assembled several departments to help to keep the streets clear and keep people safe and to let people know to shovel their Swacks and work with their neighbors.",13,,
76,0.97,511.444,521.687,I have been really impressed with Sdot and public utilities and city light and thank you to the people in the field doing the work.,13,,
77,0.97,521.754,529.061,Calvin is getting me some water to show how critical staff is not just for supporting Council but the agencies as well.,14,,
78,0.97,529.128,539.505,"And I just want to reinforce that we are staffed 24/7 to--our transportation operation center, some of our maintenance staff regardless of good weather or bad.",14,,
79,0.97,539.572,544.577,We just ramp that up when there is an emergency response to deal with.,14,,
80,0.97,544.644,556.122,"The phone number on this slide, 684-Road, is a great way for us to get informed about anything that needs to be fixed.",14,,
81,0.97,556.188,568.301,That goes directly to our dispatch and customer service groups that can respond to those things on a regular basis.,14,,
82,0.97,568.367,589.221,"We also have regulatory function at which where we issue permits for work in the right of way and partner with agencies such as sound transit, Wsdot, King County Metro, and we have a dedicated staff working daily on coordination of activities and things happening through the Seattle squeeze.",14,,
83,0.97,589.288,597.53,The major emphasis of what we do for the Department and will continue for the foreseeable future.,14,,
84,0.97,597.596,617.249,"Finally, we have planning and policy development work to shape the needs now and in the future and this includes our work to deliver on the transportation benefit district and plan for the needs of the city and Wherey with need to go from a transportation remember speculative.",14,,
85,0.97,617.316,621.12,"With that, I'll hundred it to Candida and Rachel.",14,,
86,0.97,621.187,624.29,All right.,15,,
87,0.97,624.357,625.358,Thank you.,15,,
88,0.97,625.424,631.03,"State law allows cities, towns, and counties to respond to local transportation needs.",15,,
89,0.97,631.097,645.111,"In 2010, the Seattle city council created the Seattle benefit district and the following year enacted a $20 vehicle license fee to fund improvement.",15,,
90,0.97,645.177,658.724,"In 2014, prop 1 was added to the ballot asking for voter approval of a $60 vehicle license fee and .1% sales tax all of which goes to funding transit service and low-income access.",15,,
91,0.97,658.791,662.561,So a little bit of history.,15,,
92,0.97,662.628,674.774,Seattle voters passed proposition 1 by 62% in 2014 allowing the city to collect $50 million annually for transit service.,15,,
93,0.97,674.84,695.561,"This created our transit advisory board, an advisory body that includes 12 Seattle residents, most of which are--have of which are appointed by the Mayor and Council and members used to get folks more engaged.",15,,
94,0.97,695.628,705.905,And as Councilman Pedersen pointed out at the beginning of the presentation is this ends at the end of 2020.,15,,
95,0.97,705.971,715.514,It's a 6-year period that we were asking the revenue for these purposes.,15,,
96,0.97,715.581,717.716,Another highlight is the $20.,15,,
97,0.97,717.783,726.792,"So in total, the city collects $80 in vehicle license fees and .1% sales tax.",15,,
98,0.97,726.859,744.71,"This takes in about $8 million annually and funds basic services like Street paving, potholes and signs and markings on the streets, transit spot improvements, and some bike and pedestrian master plan initiatives.",15,,
99,0.97,744.777,744.944,May I?,15,,
100,0.97,745.01,745.411,Please,16,,
101,0.97,745.478,746.545,Thank you.,17,,
102,0.97,746.612,749.081,And maybe it's here and I'm just not seeing it.,17,,
103,0.97,749.148,756.689,How much of the benefit District revenue comes from the sales tax each year?,17,,
104,0.97,756.755,757.089,Am I on?,18,,
105,0.97,757.156,757.823,Yeah,19,,
106,0.97,757.89,763.496,"So of the total benefit district, roughly $30 million comes from sales tax.",20,,
107,0.97,763.562,769.535,And so that leaves how much from the Vlf?,21,,
108,0.97,769.602,776.408,Vlf generates 60 there million a year.,22,,
109,0.97,776.475,776.709,Perfect.,23,,
110,0.97,776.775,777.309,Thank you so much.,23,,
111,0.97,777.376,783.082,And I will hand this off to Rachel to talk more about the Voter-Approved program.,24,,
112,0.97,783.149,784.116,All right.,25,,
113,0.97,784.183,802.501,"So as kind of illustrated in my answer to Councilmember Herbold, all of these are under the umbrella of the benefit district but we think of them as two items, one that was Council approved and doesn't have a sunset date and another, the 6-year voter approved measure.",25,,
114,0.97,802.568,833.132,"As we talk about the Voter- approved measure we often reference it as Std prop 1. the bulk of the funding we generate goes to buying additional trips on King County Metro routes that operate in Seattle and we fund programs like Orca opportunities, and we provide fully funded Orca cards to students and sha residents to improve transit across the city.",25,,
115,0.97,833.199,848.948,"In 2018, the city council approved a scope change which gave us flexibility to provide funding for additional Capitol projects to improve the travel time and reliability for some of the transit routes we are investing in.",25,,
116,0.97,849.014,855.02,This next graphic walks through how we have spent our program funds to date.,25,,
117,0.97,855.087,861.227,"This shows the Actuals through 2018, our 2019 where it stands, and proposed.",25,,
118,0.97,861.293,874.273,"You can see 80% of the fund guess directly towards adding the trips on the routes across the city, and 7 cents on every dollar goes to low-income access and equity.",25,,
119,0.97,874.34,874.74,Another question.,26,,
120,0.97,874.807,874.974,Yes,27,,
121,0.97,875.04,887.019,I know there are some limitations on the King County side as to how much transit we can buy from them.,28,,
122,0.97,887.086,891.523,Y know there were limitations associated with the number of bases.,28,,
123,0.97,891.59,898.797,Are there other limitations we should be considering helping King County plan for to buy more service?,28,,
124,0.97,898.864,913.245,"So we, right now we're thinking about the current lifetime of STBD which expires next year, and when we did face the struggle in capacity and available buses, that was really in 2017 and 2018.",29,,
125,0.97,913.312,925.057,It was the main driver for why we did the scope change to allow us the flexibility to continue to improve transit if we were notably to spend our funds on additional bus trips.,29,,
126,0.97,925.124,942.574,"We are in close coordination with King County when it comes to their base expansion and how they plan to grow in the next 10, 20, and 30 years to better align our planning costs.",29,,
127,0.97,942.641,948.514,So I--Y am not sure I am following the answer.,30,,
128,0.97,948.58,957.69,"Will we get what we need to add more capacity, and if not, what are the other limitations?",30,,
129,0.97,957.756,967.599,I get you are saying we are aligned closely but can you give more texture to what that means and how it might affect our decision making?,30,,
130,0.97,967.666,989.555,"One of the things Rachel tried to highlight here is we reached the point where we are now not making additional service investments, so that capacity, piece while still to be mindful of, not as immediate but we are, I think, the important thing to highlight is we are working with the county to understand their base capacity.",31,,
131,0.97,989.621,991.657,"Actually, their expansion.",31,,
132,0.97,991.724,998.664,"More than likely, we'll have opportunities to increase service because they are likely to take on more buses and drivers.",31,,
133,0.97,998.731,1003.035,So for any renewal conversation that is something we are keeping track of.,31,,
134,0.97,1003.102,1011.643,But for the immediate needs like we worked through those and ave reached the top level of what our investment will be for the life of the STBD.,31,,
135,0.97,1011.71,1013.145,Thank you.,31,,
136,0.97,1013.212,1014.346,Thank you,32,,
137,0.97,1014.413,1031.363,"May I add, it will also affect just the term of which the renewal might be so, excuse me, we expect it to increase but--excuse me.",33,,
138,0.97,1031.43,1031.73,Catching.,34,,
139,0.97,1031.797,1032.03,It is.,35,,
140,0.97,1032.097,1045.411,"[Laughter] But if we go for a longer term, it might mean a different conversation with Metro about what their capacity is overtime, and if it's a smaller time, it will probably be more constrained than today.",35,,
141,0.97,1045.477,1060.292,"I think it's early to talk about the renewal portion of it but I think the concerns have been raised and continue to be discussed, and we will continue to bring the information forward as the options get developed.",35,,
142,0.97,1060.359,1068.066,So next I'm going to go into the transit service investments have been to date.,36,,
143,0.97,1068.133,1079.511,"Currently, STBD funds 8% of King County's Metro network, a portion of the 350,000 hours that STBD currently funds.",36,,
144,0.97,1079.578,1085.551,What percentage of that is the Seattle network?,37,,
145,0.97,1085.617,1087.953,What percentage of the Seattle network?,37,,
146,0.97,1088.02,1096.728,"Because the routes transfer across the city and outside the county, it's difficult to define exactly where they breakdown.",38,,
147,0.97,1096.795,1108.373,"But you could say, you know, you could break it down into thirds and say a third of the service is in King County if you wanted to.",38,,
148,0.97,1108.44,1122.221,So since STBD began making the service investments we used STBD funds to really meet the ever growing demand in transit in Seattle and helped to provide additional frequency across the city.,38,,
149,0.97,1122.287,1127.993,"Deciding where to spend the dollars, we focused along the investment goals.",38,,
150,0.97,1128.06,1135.734,"We want to implement the frequent transit network setting up 10, 15, and 30- Monday routes serving all areas of the city.",38,,
151,0.97,1135.801,1145.477,"Next, we want to improve access for those historically disadvantaged populations.",38,,
152,0.97,1145.544,1154.82,This includes finding the racial equity analysis from 2017 and implement and act the findings.,38,,
153,0.97,1154.887,1158.156,"Third, we like to align transportation and land use goals.",38,,
154,0.97,1158.223,1168.834,"One thing we'll do is add additional trips growing across the city, and we want to address if there are any over crowded trips on the bus routes.",38,,
155,0.97,1168.901,1173.872,Lastly and all inclusive is we want to improve connections across the city.,38,,
156,0.97,1173.939,1179.177,"We know for the riders, these connections can be difficult on transit and where the routes exist.",38,,
157,0.97,1179.244,1184.049,And we want to Increasey from consequences on those services.,38,,
158,0.97,1184.116,1201.833,"We have used SB funds to improve our night owl network to make sure that people can travel whenever they need, whether at night, weekends, or peak periods.",38,,
159,0.97,1201.9,1207.506,"So I want to highlight a little of the last year of the program, the last 12 months of the program.",38,,
160,0.97,1207.573,1216.148,"It's what we refer to as year 4. first off, I have the year 4 performance report if anyone would like it.",38,,
161,0.97,1216.214,1218.784,I will pass around the copies.,38,,
162,0.97,1218.85,1220.285,Thank you.,39,,
163,0.97,1220.352,1224.256,"In year 4, STBD added 95,000 new hours of service.",40,,
164,0.97,1224.323,1235.767,"Because I know not everyone thinks about things in terms of bus hours, that's equivalent to 1550 new weekly trips cross the city of Seattle.",40,,
165,0.97,1235.834,1240.806,"In September 2018, we add over 300 new weekly trips.",40,,
166,0.97,1240.872,1251.249,"In March of 2019, another 316, and most recently in September of 2019, we added 937 new weekly trips on 23 routes across the city.",40,,
167,0.97,1251.316,1254.786,"And that's added, not cumulative?",41,,
168,0.97,1254.853,1255.153,"Yes, added.",42,,
169,0.97,1255.22,1261.093,And added to what we have done in the first 3 years of the program.,43,,
170,0.97,1261.159,1267.232,Did our earlier conversation about the capacity mean we shouldn't expect more service added in March?,44,,
171,0.97,1267.299,1267.532,Correct.,45,,
172,0.97,1267.599,1271.236,We are not making any more adds to the lifetime of the program.,45,,
173,0.97,1271.303,1272.07,Thank you.,46,,
174,0.97,1272.137,1308.874,"I also just think, you know, the question about capacity is a complex one and deserves a longer discussion as well but we have added a lot of these trips in Off-Peak times when there might be more capacity for Metrobuses and operators, adding peak hour capacity trips may be harder but we have been able to add trips where we so aligned with what Rachel described as the service goal.",47,,
175,0.97,1308.94,1336.535,"On that, why wouldn't we consider doing that for match, adding Non-Peak trips to areas that, you know, aren't for instance, meeting the goal of having the--the areas outside of those households with a 10- empty--10-Minute walk to a 10-Minute service.",48,,
176,0.97,1336.601,1347.145,"I can think of two, South park and Admiral, and Admiral in particular lost service.",48,,
177,0.97,1347.212,1368.033,Why are we not considering the base--why would we not do that for March?,48,,
178,0.97,1368.1,1373.638,Is that the current voter approved initiative expires in 2020.,48,,
179,0.97,1373.705,1381.046,And there are limits in how much we can add or subtract service with King County.,48,,
180,0.97,1381.113,1393.492,We have to have a reasonable contingency and uncertainty of the Vlf portion of the prop 1 funds.,48,,
181,0.97,1393.558,1400.832,We have been successful in getting a preliminary injunction to continue to collect those funds.,48,,
182,0.97,1400.899,1405.103,But there are still questions about whether we will continue through the course of the year.,48,,
183,0.97,1405.17,1421.253,"So at this point, we are not going to add during 2020 but want to have the discussion as we lead into a renewal and plan for what that looks like and can commit to voters.",48,,
184,0.97,1421.319,1431.93,So we want to highlight in our progress over the program to date is the expansion of what we call the very frequent network.,49,,
185,0.97,1431.997,1434.499,These are 10-Minute routes between 6:00 A.M.,49,,
186,0.97,1434.566,1434.9,And 7:00 P.M.,49,,
187,0.97,1434.966,1439.304,On weekdays and scale service from that at other times of the day.,49,,
188,0.97,1439.371,1456.021,"We--for our teen minute network, we strive on the focus of the highest density and Ridership, North, East, South, and West to serve homes, jobs, and activities across the city.",49,,
189,0.97,1456.087,1465.497,"And in the levee, we put forward the goal of providing 72% of Seattle households with access to a 10-Minute or better route by 2025.",49,,
190,0.97,1465.564,1482.981,"As you can see on this graphic, we started with 25% of households and we have increased to 85%, and we're within 2% of our 2025 goal.",49,,
191,0.97,1483.048,1485.116,I'll shut up for this one.,50,,
192,0.97,1485.183,1497.729,I just want to point out there are a lot of areas on the map that don't meet this but South park and Admiral.,51,,
193,0.97,1497.796,1499.03,Make a note of that.,51,,
194,0.97,1499.097,1504.402,I appreciate that.,52,,
195,0.97,1504.469,1505.537,We are aware.,52,,
196,0.97,1505.604,1513.345,So next I'll talk briefly about how we improve transportation equity and transportation access.,52,,
197,0.97,1513.411,1543.708,"First, to improve transportation option for students, the city of Seattle launched the Orca program in 2018; and this expanded our use of 12-month cards for high school students, income eligible students and graphic scholars and highlighted the program through June of 2019, so it doesn't take into account this school year we are currently in.",52,,
198,0.97,1543.775,1551.349,This is the photographic slide from earlier.,52,,
199,0.97,1551.416,1554.819,Here is a quick Snapshot.,52,,
200,0.97,1554.886,1559.891,I mentioned the Orca opportunity program as it pertains to students and youth.,52,,
201,0.97,1559.958,1572.871,We launched a 12-month pilot to expand Orca student and provide 1500 Orca income cards to income eligible FHA residents.,52,,
202,0.97,1572.938,1589.587,"Today, over 1600 FHA residents have a fully funded Orca card, and we worked with the transportation equity work group with Community-Guided Reportations to develop the transportation equity agenda.",52,,
203,0.97,1589.654,1611.876,The youth Ambassador program engages with youth community based organizations to help to teach them about accessible and affordable transportation options and to be a resource within their respective communities to share information about how to affordable access transportation options.,52,,
204,0.97,1611.943,1618.216,"And Lastly, this past year, we launched the senior regional fare permit pilot.",52,,
205,0.97,1618.283,1622.087,And this really seeks to engage our elderly community.,52,,
206,0.97,1622.153,1638.67,There are a lot of folks that are unaware this program exists which is a wonderful way for the 65-Plus community to be able to get affordable transit options.,52,,
207,0.97,1638.737,1641.072,We enroll them in the program and how to use it.,52,,
208,0.97,1641.139,1649.18,"Some of these folks have never been taught to use transit, and when they do, they love it and consider taking it for new trips.",52,,
209,0.97,1649.247,1649.581,Thank you.,53,,
210,0.97,1649.647,1653.651,Thank you for highlighting the benefits.,53,,
211,0.97,1653.718,1655.987,It's aptly named the transportation benefit district.,53,,
212,0.97,1656.054,1666.498,I know we will hear more theater year about options for renewal so we can stay on top of that and communicate that to constituents.,53,,
213,0.97,1666.564,1670.301,Any questions from my colleagues before we let them go?,53,,
214,0.97,1670.368,1670.635,Thank you.,54,,
215,0.97,1670.702,1671.436,Thank you.,55,,
216,0.97,1671.503,1672.737,All right.,56,,
217,0.97,1672.804,1673.038,Thank you.,56,,
218,0.97,1673.104,1686.518,We'll have the clerk read the next item.,56,,
219,0.97,1686.584,1686.684,& GT;,57,,
220,0.97,1686.751,1696.628,Seattle public utilities overview and discussion of items of business anticipated to be heard in the transportation and utilities Committee in 2020.,58,,
221,0.97,1696.694,1696.928,Great.,59,,
222,0.97,1696.995,1700.298,So now we have Seattle public utilities here.,59,,
223,0.97,1700.365,1704.702,I appreciate everybody being here and why don't we have you introduce yourselves?,59,,
224,0.97,1704.769,1712.41,We'll again start with our esteemed central staffer.,59,,
225,0.97,1712.477,1716.314,Thank you.,60,,
226,0.97,1716.381,1717.348,Andrew Lee.,61,,
227,0.97,1717.415,1717.782,Kahreen Tebeau.,62,,
228,0.97,1717.849,1724.689,Thank you for bringing in a public presentation.,63,,
229,0.97,1724.756,1734.833,"We have new committee member s this year, including myself.",63,,
230,0.97,1734.899,1741.072,And this is a great overview of what we will see for 2020.,63,,
231,0.97,1741.139,1748.646,"While that's happening, I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here.",64,,
232,0.97,1748.713,1750.048,I am not Mami Hara.,64,,
233,0.97,1750.115,1755.12,She really wanted to be here but she came down with an illness.,64,,
234,0.97,1755.186,1767.866,"I am Andrew Lee, the deputy director of wastewater at Seattle public utilities, and I am happy to be here on behalf of the Ratepayers.",64,,
235,0.97,1767.932,1789.354,"Spu has 1400 employees to make sure that people have safe drinking water, have toilet that can be flushed and roads that won't be flooded and pick up the thrash.",64,,
236,0.97,1789.42,1789.654,T R ash.,64,,
237,0.97,1789.721,1797.562,We don't get a lot of attention but it's Arguably the most essential part of life in our city.,64,,
238,0.97,1797.629,1811.409,I will provide the overview and we will dive into the particular focus area for Spu which is the work on keeping our services efficient and affordable for our customers.,64,,
239,0.97,1811.476,1818.216,Kahreen Tebeau will speak on speaking to ensure that our rates are affordable for our customers.,64,,
240,0.97,1818.283,1823.588,"Spu's budget is among the largest for our city, totaling $1.4 billion in 2020.",64,,
241,0.97,1823.655,1835.867,"We are one of the most Capital- intensive departments in the city and for reference, almost 1/3 of the billion annually is for capital improvement presents.",64,,
242,0.97,1835.934,1846.044,We provide safe drinking water to 1.4 million people and suburban water districts and cities.,64,,
243,0.97,1846.11,1851.349,We provide garbage and recycling and compost collection.,64,,
244,0.97,1851.416,1855.453,We build and maintain 2100 miles of pipes to transport wastewater.,64,,
245,0.97,1855.52,1861.226,We operate the call center for Spu and city light customers.,64,,
246,0.97,1861.292,1882.347,"We provide engineering and surveying, and Lastly on the left-hand picture, we provide clean city services such as cleaning illegal dumping, and the vehicle Hotline and providing homeless services and trash, relieving graffiti, needles, and public litter and recycling across the city.",64,,
247,0.97,1882.413,1883.381,The next slide?,64,,
248,0.97,1883.448,1893.491,"We strive to focus on what our customers in our community value, engaging and listening to our customers which is the foundation of everything we do.",64,,
249,0.97,1893.558,1902.066,"Based on our research and outreach by our city and other city departments, six priorities on this slide consistently rise to the top.",64,,
250,0.97,1902.133,1914.078,"These are the customer values we use to inform our planning and service delivery, and they provide the framework for our strategic business plan.",64,,
251,0.97,1914.145,1915.079,The next slide.,64,,
252,0.97,1915.146,1919.684,The strategic business plan directs our focus areas for a 6- year time frame.,64,,
253,0.97,1919.751,1935.266,"The framework is built around three focus areas, and those focus areas reflect equity and empowerment, risk and resiliency, and accountability and Affordability.",64,,
254,0.97,1935.333,1945.743,"Because of the limited time I am going to focus on one aspect, account and and--Affordability.",64,,
255,0.97,1945.81,1947.945,Thank you,65,,
256,0.97,1948.012,1953.985,Spu's average single-family monthly bill which coverages our services is $200 per month.,66,,
257,0.97,1954.052,1957.488,This is comparable to build from other cities in the region.,66,,
258,0.97,1957.555,1969.467,"However, we know that rising utility bills tend to have a disproportionate impact on those who can least afford to pay.",66,,
259,0.97,1969.534,1969.867,Question.,67,,
260,0.97,1969.934,1970.101,Yes,68,,
261,0.97,1970.168,1972.67,It includes the utility packs?,69,,
262,0.97,1972.737,1972.97,It does.,70,,
263,0.97,1973.037,1985.616,"Just to make a note because of an interest in increased transparency, the taxes are going to the general fund.",71,,
264,0.97,1985.683,1988.086,They are not--it's not revenue.,71,,
265,0.97,1988.152,1996.961,We worked with Spu over the previous years to make sure that that utility is called out on our utility bills.,71,,
266,0.97,1997.028,2000.198,It's something that is not going back to the utility.,71,,
267,0.97,2000.264,2002.166,It's going into our general fund.,71,,
268,0.97,2002.233,2008.306,"There is a lot of, I think Regressivity.",71,,
269,0.97,2008.373,2016.748,And also on the Affordability challenges associated with utility bills that might be worth taking a look at.,71,,
270,0.97,2016.814,2019.083,Thank you.,72,,
271,0.97,2019.15,2031.562,Councilwoman Herbold chaired the committee that oversaw the public utility previously and we are lucky to have the knowledge and bringing the additional transparency to the people's bills.,72,,
272,0.97,2031.629,2045.209,"Utility tax has been around for a long time, and it's challenging for people to pay those bills and it's good to know that it's subsidizing.",72,,
273,0.97,2045.276,2045.51,Thank you.,72,,
274,0.97,2045.576,2053.184,And we provided the Council with the Affordability and accountability plan.,73,,
275,0.97,2053.251,2057.388,That provided improvements in the six areas that are shown on the slide.,73,,
276,0.97,2057.455,2069.901,"On the next six slides, I'm going to walk through examples of how we are working on improving the practice in each areas, and I will tell a story to bring this to light.",73,,
277,0.97,2069.967,2073.971,"Capital project planning and delivery, an area of considerable activity.",73,,
278,0.97,2074.038,2080.378,As I mentioned our billion is about a third made up by capital projects.,73,,
279,0.97,2080.445,2089.387,"Just for context as well, the 2018 to 2023 budget has approximately $2 billion in spending capital.",73,,
280,0.97,2089.454,2109.874,"The plan identified 16 actions to reduce costs to improve speed and reduce the cost of the program because it's a large program $2 billion, and even a 1% savings is $20 million, so it's huge.",73,,
281,0.97,2109.941,2122.987,And our contracting process for getting engineers and designers from external sources oftentimes averages around 6 months and go to a year.,73,,
282,0.97,2123.054,2126.657,In that period of time we are in essence waiting.,73,,
283,0.97,2126.724,2141.706,If we can improve the speed without compromising the commitment to a fair and equitable process this can lead to same Savings and dollar savings.,73,,
284,0.97,2141.772,2147.445,We are looking at opportunities to work outside our business with external partners to reduce costs.,73,,
285,0.97,2147.512,2159.991,One of the opportunities we have in the committee is it's an infrastructure committee and we can coordinate with Sdot who we heard from and save money and service.,74,,
286,0.97,2160.057,2173.037,"We have been Partnering with Sdot for years on the rehabilitation of the sewers, and some of the lowest delivery costs is when we partner.",75,,
287,0.97,2173.104,2173.638,So that's advantageous.,75,,
288,0.97,2173.704,2194.225,One of the things we did in the rate process is--we want 100% of the projects delivered 100% on time.,76,,
289,0.97,2194.292,2201.332,"And what we did is applied a more realistic 97% completion rate, and that had an impact.",76,,
290,0.97,2201.399,2228.492,"So that might be another thing to take a look at, how--what is our completion rate for the projects and sacrificing the goal of continuous improvement should the rate pass be set at some different measure based on the Realty.",76,,
291,0.97,2228.559,2229.794,That's true.,77,,
292,0.97,2229.86,2240.738,We tend to be fairly optimistic in what we deliver which is good but it can mean more rate money that doesn't get spent.,77,,
293,0.97,2240.805,2249.246,"Moving to efficiency and movement, Spu is focus on a culture of constant improvement.",77,,
294,0.97,2249.313,2264.996,"You may have heard of lean, and it works in the automotive industry like Toyota, and the entire organization BUYS into a mentality of continuously looking for improvements in how they deliver their work.",77,,
295,0.97,2265.062,2271.502,The methodology is intensely focused on Analytics.,77,,
296,0.97,2271.569,2283.547,What I love about lean is it emphasizes empowering employees to come to work with their best ideas and best creative thinking of how to do their work better.,77,,
297,0.97,2283.614,2296.594,We have had some isolated lean projects in the last several years but we have systematically established a Cohort of 20 to 30 individuals applying lean across the utilities.,77,,
298,0.97,2296.661,2311.475,"Just to highlight a small example, we have a service level goal in our operations of responding to priority 9 work orders which are the most high priority like sewer backup, flooding or water main breaks.",77,,
299,0.97,2311.542,2337.535,"90% of those work orders I want to respond within one hour, and what we found last year is we were not hitting our mark and decreasing on the trend, and taking a principle from lean we have a dashboard to show the work orders in the city and information to track like when the call came in and who responded and how fast.",77,,
300,0.97,2337.601,2341.639,And our teams met weekly to review the data.,77,,
301,0.97,2341.706,2345.509,"That's a process of called doing Huddles, actually.",77,,
302,0.97,2345.576,2353.317,"The process is very simple, and the employees came and looked at the data and said a lot of the problems are rising from this particular cause.",77,,
303,0.97,2353.384,2360.391,"For example, one of the causes they identified is we were missing the mark especially when we had shift changes.",77,,
304,0.97,2360.458,2367.231,The Handoff from the previous crew like the afternoon crew wasn't going smoothly to the evening crew.,77,,
305,0.97,2367.298,2369.033,We were exceeding our mark.,77,,
306,0.97,2369.1,2383.047,"We said let's smooth that transition, and making those transitions like that and monitoring and improving it, we were able in 4 out of 6 months at the end of 2019 we were able to hit the 90% mark.",77,,
307,0.97,2383.114,2385.85,"Again, it's a simple, continuous improvement.",77,,
308,0.97,2385.916,2390.387,So this is an exciting organizational transition.,77,,
309,0.97,2390.454,2393.624,I think we will share this incoming year.,77,,
310,0.97,2393.691,2394.825,Thank you.,78,,
311,0.97,2394.892,2401.432,"Moving to partnership opportunities, we're strongly committed to building partnership.",79,,
312,0.97,2401.499,2412.176,"As a utility provider, you are probably familiar that we are legally required to spend Ratepayer money on utilities and not that doesn't have a utility nexus.",79,,
313,0.97,2412.243,2413.911,This can limit us.,79,,
314,0.97,2413.978,2422.286,It can be oftentimes much more effective and beneficial for communities if they are done in partnership with Non-Utility interests.,79,,
315,0.97,2422.353,2427.925,"The partners, I believe, are the key to unlocking the potential.",79,,
316,0.97,2427.992,2439.103,"As an example, more than $100 million will be spent in South Park, and will improve drainage and water quality in the area.",79,,
317,0.97,2439.17,2452.249,"Every time we are in the South Park neighborhood we hear about jobs and we hear about housing and concerns about potential displacement, things that are not traditionally in the utilities arena.",79,,
318,0.97,2452.316,2476.841,"We have partnered and received a grant to work with other city departments, community organizations, and through the grant we're working with the partners to identify ways to go beyond Utilitys in South Park to enhance climate resilience, build economic opportunities, and avoid Dispolicement displacement for the people who live here",79,,
319,0.97,2476.907,2497.595,I want to thank the utility for the recognition that the very thing that you do to make--the Utility-Related things to make the community like South Park more resilient can help accelerate the displacement that is already happening there.,80,,
320,0.97,2497.661,2518.916,"I think it's from that recognition, you know, even rain gardens make it more attractive.",80,,
321,0.97,2518.983,2532.363,I really appreciate the recognition and the partnership with the community with other things that can make it resilient outside of the utility Baliwick.,80,,
322,0.97,2532.429,2536.333,Our general manager Mami Hara has been very good about that,81,,
323,0.97,2536.4,2540.905,Thank you for the displacement mentioning.,82,,
324,0.97,2540.971,2555.853,"I think that will be a theme with the city council like the committee that you are chairing, Morales and Strauss's committee and thank you for talking with climate resiliency.",82,,
325,0.97,2555.92,2574.471,"The green new deal resolution was passed last year, and I am introducing this on a fiscal note, they will ask climate change, and we are--we want to be more mindful of that, and you are ahead of the curve.",82,,
326,0.97,2574.538,2574.772,Thank you.,82,,
327,0.97,2574.838,2578.909,And thank you for your partnership.,83,,
328,0.97,2578.976,2582.68,"Moving to regulatory alignment, utility is a highly regulated business.",83,,
329,0.97,2582.746,2598.595,"We are required to comply for Federal and state laws for safe drinking water, Stormwater pollution, and Environmntal impact, and I could go on and on, and regulatory compliance is a significant driver for the operating and capital budget.",83,,
330,0.97,2598.662,2603.767,The two pictures here show the two larger projects with the overflow into the water.,83,,
331,0.97,2603.834,2620.884,"The left picture is the tunnel launch site in Ballard for the $570 million ship Canal water quality project our largest ever, and the right is the Henderson overflow facility that was completed several years ago.",83,,
332,0.97,2620.951,2630.16,Both projects are in response to regulations with Eta and the Department of Ecology.,83,,
333,0.97,2630.227,2646.543,"We are absolutely committed to protecting public health and the environment in projects like these, and at the same time, we are looking for opportunities to regulate influence, and we can maximize the benefit of every dollar we spent and keep Affordability for residents.",83,,
334,0.97,2646.61,2650.714,I want to take a moment and say thank you and share Kudos.,84,,
335,0.97,2650.781,2656.787,I met with the team on the 24th on the huge overflow site in Ballard.,84,,
336,0.97,2656.854,2663.027,"The plans are coming along very well, and the team seems to be very well versed and engage in the community in a positive way.",84,,
337,0.97,2663.093,2663.894,Thank you,85,,
338,0.97,2663.961,2666.397,I wanted to share the thanks and congratulations,86,,
339,0.97,2666.463,2669.366,And thank you for the partner on that.,87,,
340,0.97,2669.433,2676.774,"So moving on to budget and financial management, we are continuously moving to bring down the rate of growth in the rates.",87,,
341,0.97,2676.84,2684.615,On the left side of the graphic you can see the 6-year average rate of increase for the individual funds.,87,,
342,0.97,2684.681,2694.158,"The highest rates of growth not surprisingly are in drainage and wastewater, and in our project to reduce sewage Overflows which I just spoke about.",87,,
343,0.97,2694.224,2699.93,The separate bills lead to an increase in the combined bill which is our customers usually see.,87,,
344,0.97,2699.997,2705.869,The 6 year increase in the combined bill is on the right side hand in the White box below the green box.,87,,
345,0.97,2705.936,2721.785,"As you can see in the upper white box, planned in Spb, the most recent plan projected a 5.2% increase from 2018 to 2023.",87,,
346,0.97,2721.852,2734.698,"But we have been able to shave off 0.2% which way not sound like a lot but is a lot for our customers, and we're not done.",87,,
347,0.97,2734.765,2744.308,"By implementing some of the accountability and Affordability recommends that I described earlier, our aim is to consider lowering the rate capacity more.",87,,
348,0.97,2744.374,2748.078,That's great news.,88,,
349,0.97,2748.145,2762.092,"I know that Councilmember Herbold worked hard on that with Mami Hara the year before, so anything that the committee can do to bring the rates down, please let us know, and we'll encourage you along the way for sure.",88,,
350,0.97,2762.159,2766.196,"So Lastly, this is the last slide and I'll transfer it over to Kahreen.",89,,
351,0.97,2766.263,2771.168,I come to an important part of our business which is customer assistance.,89,,
352,0.97,2771.235,2792.89,"As you know, despite the booming economy here in Seattle and it's one of the wealthiest regions, and given the growing disparities, the customer services efforts, focus on ensuring that our services are each accessible to everyone.",89,,
353,0.97,2792.956,2800.764,And I pass it to Kahreen Tebeau who will share highlights of the utility discount program.,89,,
354,0.97,2800.831,2804.568,"Thank you, Andrew, and good morning chairman and Committee.",90,,
355,0.97,2804.635,2812.376,I would like to start with showing you this graphic that you may have seen in the Seattle times recently.,90,,
356,0.97,2812.442,2823.02,"It shows the large disparities in wealth in our community, those who own a home and those who do not and the race lines.",90,,
357,0.97,2823.086,2835.332,"The median network of the Whys households is almost 20 times as the black household, and we have a large disparity in age and education level.",90,,
358,0.97,2835.399,2849.58,"Because of the disparities in the communities that we serve, it's important that we have not just one approach but multiple tools to address the Affordability gaps and make sure that the critical services are accessible to everyone.",90,,
359,0.97,2849.646,2856.42,"Today, I would like to introduce you to two of our most important affordable programs and two related pilot programs.",90,,
360,0.97,2856.486,2879.676,"The first program I would like to talk with you about is the utility Dispownt program or Udp, households earning up to 70% of the state median income can qualify, and each and every bill is cut in half, a 50% discount.",90,,
361,0.97,2879.743,2898.929,"This is a joint program between two Utilitys, and enrolled households receive a discount from Seattle city light and persons at the human services Department and administer the program on our behalf.",90,,
362,0.97,2898.996,2903.3,"Today, we have just over 34,000 households enrolled in the program.",90,,
363,0.97,2903.367,2913.71,The other program I would like to highlight is the Spu's emergency assistance program or Eap.,90,,
364,0.97,2913.777,2918.949,Households earning up to 80% of the state median can qualify.,90,,
365,0.97,2919.016,2938.101,Udp provides a discount on every bill but Eap Forgives a bill for households without children or two a year for households with 2 children for a maximum of 448 every year.,90,,
366,0.97,2938.168,2941.905,And that goes up to combined bills.,90,,
367,0.97,2941.972,2957.788,"We have received requests for information this morning for folks about the program, and you might be getting to it but do you have information about the--you said 34,000 are enrolled.",91,,
368,0.97,2957.854,2965.162,Is that new unique enrollees every year versus the folks who are renewing their participation in the program?,91,,
369,0.97,2965.228,2966.129,Do you have that data?,91,,
370,0.97,2966.196,2967.931,We do have that data.,92,,
371,0.97,2967.998,2974.404,"The 34,000 is just the total number of households receiving the discount.",92,,
372,0.97,2974.471,2982.913,"But we have data from 2018 showing new enrollees in 2019, and can I ask human services to get that data.",92,,
373,0.97,2982.979,2989.953,And what is the information available to participants to understand the process for Reenrolling?,93,,
374,0.97,2990.02,3003.834,Because part of the question we received is why is it so difficult for folks to Re- enroll if they have already qualified and continue to meet the qualification requirements?,93,,
375,0.97,3003.9,3008.605,Is there a way to reduce barriers to get that done more quickly?,93,,
376,0.97,3008.672,3017.481,"Yes, and we will talk about that and develop a more comprehensive response to the E- mail I saw just before I came to the hearing.",94,,
377,0.97,3017.547,3027.157,Do we have an estimation of how many households in Seattle would be eligible for the program and how many are enrolled?,95,,
378,0.97,3027.224,3038.568,"We are working right now--you know the demographics in Seattle can change quickly, and the last figure was 98,000 households.",96,,
379,0.97,3038.635,3049.613,We have roughly 1/3 if the number stays relatively similar to what it was last year.,96,,
380,0.97,3049.679,3052.849,"The 34,000 number, I have to check that.",97,,
381,0.97,3052.916,3066.663,It was referred to another document an Hsd document that reportedly States that this number is new enrollment and they only report new enrollment.,97,,
382,0.97,3066.73,3071.902,It might not be accurate but I would love to double check that.,97,,
383,0.97,3071.968,3097.828,"And also on the--on the threshold to income qualify for both programs, I want to flag my interest in not using the state's median income that, for a high-cost city like Seattle, we should be using an area median income that is linked to the cost of living in our city.",97,,
384,0.97,3097.894,3118.215,"I've raised this issue in the past, and I want to flag it for--I know that that--that in making utilities more affordable for low income folks it has an offsetting cost on utility bills for folks who don't qualify.",97,,
385,0.97,3118.281,3125.155,I think those are things we have to struggle with.,97,,
386,0.97,3125.222,3127.023,Thank you.,98,,
387,0.97,3127.09,3133.563,"Finally, I would like to say that Eap is in addition to Udp.",98,,
388,0.97,3133.63,3142.772,"Households earning up to 70% can qualify, so it adds up to a substantial amount of relief.",98,,
389,0.97,3142.839,3158.255,"So the first pilot program I would like to talk about, we recently launched two that were related to the core programs to see how we can optimize them, and we have worked with the office of renovation and performance to carry them out.",98,,
390,0.97,3158.321,3172.302,The first pilot is the Upd self certification pilot.,98,,
391,0.97,3172.369,3181.378,We are attesting their own income rather than having to qualify that.,98,,
392,0.97,3181.444,3187.45,And self certification is used in California by Pg & amp; E program wide and it was very successful.,98,,
393,0.97,3187.517,3189.986,So I think the purpose is clear.,98,,
394,0.97,3190.053,3200.897,"We are trying to reduce barriers to enrollment, make it easier, and try and get more households enrolled out of the 65,000 households that are eligible and not enrolled.",98,,
395,0.97,3200.964,3210.64,We are looking for better and easier ways to get people enrolled in the program.,98,,
396,0.97,3210.707,3230.026,"There is risk, so we are developing new auditing techniques that are used in California to make auditing more efficient and accurate and minimize the risk of self certification, and if this is a more cost effective way of doing the program.",98,,
397,0.97,3230.093,3248.044,I also want to thank the utilities in working with constituents trying to use the fast track application process.,99,,
398,0.97,3248.111,3279.576,"We ran into one constituent who tried to renew using fast track and was told that it was only for new enrollees, and the utility staff advocated on her behalf ably and Hsd wanted to Re-Write the rules before they would apply them or allow her to apply using them.",99,,
399,0.97,3279.643,3288.918,"Again, these are examples of barriers I think are in conflict of continuous improvement.",99,,
400,0.97,3288.985,3293.156,I really appreciate your diligence in that.,99,,
401,0.97,3293.223,3293.69,Good.,100,,
402,0.97,3293.757,3294.691,Thank you.,100,,
403,0.97,3294.758,3312.876,So the last--the second pilot that we recently launched that Úi would like to tell you about is the Udp Shut-Off prevention pilot to reduce the rates of households that have their water shut off due to Non- payment.,100,,
404,0.97,3312.942,3315.278,"Currently, the Shut-Off rate is almost exactly 1%.",100,,
405,0.97,3315.345,3320.717,Our goal is to reduce that to as close to zero as possible.,100,,
406,0.97,3320.784,3324.521,And we have multiple tools we'll use to achieve that.,100,,
407,0.97,3324.587,3337.801,"The first tool is with leadership from Councilmember Herbold is significantly expanded the emergency assistance program I just mentioned, doubled the amount of assistance and allowed more households to qualify.",100,,
408,0.97,3337.867,3347.377,We are anticipating that this piece alone will be a very effective tool in preventing water Shut-Off for lower income households.,100,,
409,0.97,3347.444,3357.42,We'll be doing better and more Proactive communication with the households to let them know that the program exists.,100,,
410,0.97,3357.487,3371.668,"We started with any household who is potentially facing a water shut off, and we started to place door hangers at their house, and the day that they would have been shut off to say, are you aware of emergency assistance?",100,,
411,0.97,3371.735,3381.511,"Please contact us and give them a week to contact us, and we were finding many people were not aware of the program and are now taking advantage of it.",100,,
412,0.97,3381.578,3383.012,So it seems very effective.,100,,
413,0.97,3383.079,3388.284,So the benefits of the pilot are 2 fold.,100,,
414,0.97,3388.351,3392.689,"The first, obvious, preventing Shut-Off that might be taking place.",100,,
415,0.97,3392.756,3420.717,"The tools that we have, the emergency assistance program, the out reach, and the Udp discount I think combined will be effective at reducing the 1% rate down to a small fraction of that, and I anticipate there will still be a small number of households despite the policies and tools and programs will continue to have a difficult to pay the bill out right once a year.",100,,
416,0.97,3420.784,3437.1,The other major benefit is this will provide us with critical date to understand the small number of households that will continue to fall into that gap for whom the current tools just aren't enough.,100,,
417,0.97,3437.167,3443.973,"For example, we know it's generally low-income households.",100,,
418,0.97,3444.04,3449.813,But is it 100% of the poverty Úline?,100,,
419,0.97,3449.879,3450.013,200%?,100,,
420,0.97,3450.079,3479.142,"It's just Guesswork, so this pilot will be looking at and talking with households and looking at the data that we have from like the Udp applications to see the income levels that they are falling into so that we can get a better sense of which households are falling into the gap and what income level are they at and other relevant circumstances so that we can design a targeted Affordability tool.",100,,
421,0.97,3479.209,3500.296,I want to also flag that there is also a number of private property owners of multifamily housing where low income people live that do not pay their bills and their landlord does.,101,,
422,0.97,3500.363,3523.353,"I ran 2 two large Multiunit buildings where the landlord did not pay the bill and the Tennants were facing a shut off that was averted but I think that's another population that we should look at, creating tools to not get to that point.",101,,
423,0.97,3523.419,3529.792,"Again, the utility is forgiving as far as how behind in your bill you have to be before facing a shut off.",101,,
424,0.97,3529.859,3542.538,"These are landlords who are operating--some of them, large management companies that operate thousands of units of housing in the city that are engaging in the practices.",101,,
425,0.97,3542.605,3547.21,I think we need to drill down on those as well.,101,,
426,0.97,3547.277,3547.51,Agreed.,102,,
427,0.97,3547.577,3547.744,Agreed.,102,,
428,0.97,3547.81,3553.549,My final NOTE is this is just a few examples of broader efforts.,102,,
429,0.97,3553.616,3567.764,"We have other established programs and policy tools including recent work to improve our communications with Tennants in Melty family buildings, and we have new tools under development.",102,,
430,0.97,3567.83,3574.938,And we would be happy to come back and brief you or individually brief you on the breadth of our customer assistance efforts.,102,,
431,0.97,3575.004,3581.945,Just really want to thank you for the program and look forward to working with you to enroll as many families and households as possible.,103,,
432,0.97,3582.011,3582.545,Thank you so much.,103,,
433,0.97,3582.612,3583.846,Thank you.,104,,
434,0.97,3583.913,3590.887,I think you heard a theme of Affordability.,105,,
435,0.97,3590.954,3591.621,It was impressive.,105,,
436,0.97,3591.688,3603.032,"We got an E-mail from a constituent and brought it up and we've all read it, and we are in tune with our constituents and the Ratepayers.",105,,
437,0.97,3603.099,3604.334,We will lean into Affordability for sure.,105,,
438,0.97,3604.4,3605.535,Thank you for being here.,105,,
439,0.97,3605.601,3606.736,Thank you very much.,106,,
440,0.97,3606.803,3613.142,Read the next item into the agenda about city light.,107,,
441,0.97,3613.209,3634.664,"Seattle city light, overview and discussion of items of business anticipated to be heard in the transportation and utilities Committee in 2020.",108,,
442,0.97,3634.731,3635.064,Welcome.,109,,

448,0.97,3662.158,3663.226,All right.,111,,
449,0.97,3663.292,3663.526,Thank you.,111,,
450,0.97,3663.593,3664.06,Sorry.,112,,
451,0.97,3664.127,3667.03,A lot going on here.,112,,
452,0.97,3667.096,3668.097,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",112,,
453,0.97,3668.164,3675.571,I'm Debra Smith and the general manager and Ceo of Seattle city light.,112,,
454,0.97,3675.638,3676.439,Thank you.,113,,
455,0.97,3676.506,3682.045,"We'll just dive into your presentation, the overview, and what we expect to see in 2020.",113,,
456,0.97,3682.111,3682.345,Right.,114,,
457,0.97,3682.412,3689.352,"We have a lot going on, and I'm excited to share it with you and with our new Councilmembers.",114,,
458,0.97,3689.419,3694.29,And so we are in the process of updating our mission and values.,114,,
459,0.97,3694.357,3700.73,"I appreciated that when Sam was talking for us, that's what he started.",114,,
460,0.97,3700.797,3716.479,We are bringing updated or incorporating updated mission values into the strategic plan you will be reviewing this summer but I will share our vision which is different than the vision you would have seen if I put the poster up there.,114,,
461,0.97,3716.546,3728.157,Our vision going forward is Partnering with our customers and ensuring that their energy needs are met in whatever way they choose.,114,,
462,0.97,3728.224,3731.727,We are focusing on creating customer choice and meeting customer where is they are.,114,,
463,0.97,3731.794,3736.165,I would love to say that we are unique but we're not.,114,,
464,0.97,3736.232,3747.91,The customers have more choices and the notion of our electric utility as a monopoly that can Paternalistically decide how you pay for it.,114,,
465,0.97,3747.977,3756.085,"That's a relic of the past, and we are moving forward quickly in making that transition.",114,,
466,0.97,3756.152,3759.555,The future is Seattle city light.,114,,
467,0.97,3759.622,3770.5,"It's one of the oldest public utilities in the country and the 10th largest public utility in the United States, and the largest public utility in the Northwest.",114,,
468,0.97,3770.566,3771.801,So that was the future.,114,,
469,0.97,3771.868,3776.239,This is the future that we talk about now.,114,,
470,0.97,3776.305,3779.242,This is a slide that in process but I love it.,114,,
471,0.97,3779.308,3789.118,It kind of talks about where we're headed and captures a whole lot of what you are going to see next year and in future years all in one picture.,114,,
472,0.97,3789.185,3824.687,"So wherever you see the little radio, those are--that represents the AMI system where, as you know, many of you are aware we have been implementing the AMI system, and in 2020, one of the priorities is to complete the second phase of integration so we can start delivering value to our customer owners from the investment that they have made in the system, and you also see, if you look at the picture, distributed generation which continues to be a high priority for the customers.",114,,
473,0.97,3824.754,3825.888,They like energy independence.,114,,
474,0.97,3825.955,3840.57,"Our job is again to support them in having their energy needs met in a way they choose, rooftop solar, battery storage, Microgrids.",114,,
475,0.97,3840.636,3849.212,There are all kinds of Technologys that are emerging and becoming commercially viable.,114,,
476,0.97,3849.278,3860.323,I sometimes talk about technology being a driver for change and customer's expectations about how the services will be delivered to them has changed.,114,,
477,0.97,3860.389,3867.863,I think that is nowhere truer than Seattle where we live in the midst of technology and it's the Enabler of change.,114,,
478,0.97,3867.93,3890.086,"So the things that our customers want are, you know, we compete--I talk about this, we compete not with PSE or Tacoma power but Amazon and anyone who believes they have a space in the energy future and many organizations, many Tech places who spend a lot of time thinking about that.",114,,
479,0.97,3890.152,3891.821,That's what our shared customers want.,114,,
480,0.97,3891.887,3894.89,We can go to the next slide.,114,,
481,0.97,3894.957,3899.962,So some information about city light.,114,,
482,0.97,3900.029,3904.333,"This is our adopted budget, $1.432 billion for 2020.",114,,
483,0.97,3904.4,3915.344,"So of that, a little over a billion is operations and maintenance expense and our capital improvement plan is $378 million.",114,,
484,0.97,3915.411,3934.297,"So if you start at the pie with the green purchase power and provide budget authority for both short term and long-term services, and debt service on outstanding debt, and city light is generally in the bond market on an annual basis.",114,,
485,0.97,3934.363,3942.038,"That is part of how we manage our rate structure, by funding with long-term debt instrument.",114,,
486,0.97,3942.104,3946.742,And taxes provide funding for both state and city taxes.,114,,
487,0.97,3946.809,3950.946,Deferred O and M. you can see that slice of the pie.,114,,
488,0.97,3951.013,3959.922,"That is used for conservation incentive programs, and we finance them similar to capital costs.",114,,
489,0.97,3959.989,3962.391,That's why they are deferred.,114,,
490,0.97,3962.458,3972.935,"Capital expense is the fully loaded cost that includes investments in the transmission and distribution system, generation facilities, and buildings and Fks.",114,,
491,0.97,3973.002,3983.546,City services is the cost of Seattle IP and the call center that you heard is provided for us.,114,,
492,0.97,3983.612,3987.483,We have a shared call center with Seattle public utilities.,114,,
493,0.97,3987.55,4002.531,O and M and general expense is mostly labor and benefits for the 1792 employees that currently maintain and administer the utility program.,114,,
494,0.97,4002.598,4026.489,"Lastly, you'll NOTE we have called out controllable O and M of $306 million, and that represents the billion part that we can reduce, can't reduce all of it because of all the assets but those are the expenses that in some way we have day-to-day control over.",114,,
495,0.97,4026.555,4027.323,A quick overview.,114,,
496,0.97,4027.39,4044.006,"We serve the city of Seattle and 8 franchise communities and a total population of over 900,000 people.",114,,
497,0.97,4044.073,4050.346,"So customer statistics, these slides coming out of our new finger facts book, and Mora will provide those to you.",114,,
498,0.97,4050.413,4054.917,"So they are 2018 data, and there is generally a 1-Year lag.",114,,
499,0.97,4054.984,4059.889,Currently have one of these on my desk.,115,,
500,0.97,4059.955,4062.191,It's really helpful.,116,,
501,0.97,4062.258,4064.527,I carry 1 with me everywhere I go.,116,,
502,0.97,4064.593,4086.816,"While we have a large number of residential customers, Ironically, they use 25% of the power and Non-Residential represents 50% of the power, and in return, 20% available through wholesale purchases through long-term contacts and the energy market.",116,,
503,0.97,4086.882,4094.99,"U-Dub is the largest customer, and I want to explain the Verbiage and language.",116,,
504,0.97,4095.057,4096.559,We controversy it as being long.,116,,
505,0.97,4096.625,4111.874,"So we are long in power, and what that means is that we generally, generally can have access to more power than we need to serve our customers.",116,,
506,0.97,4111.941,4126.222,"However, the prudent risk management policies and the Seasonality of when we generate more power which is generally in the spring versus United States being a Winter-Peaking utility mean that on any day we are generally in the market.",116,,
507,0.97,4126.288,4136.232,"That means we are buying and selling, both to close and balance in the hour but also to close our position.",116,,
508,0.97,4136.298,4144.607,So that's risk management terminology and it refers to essentially managing risk by closing out the long position when you know you have it.,116,,
509,0.97,4144.673,4166.962,"So what that means is that when we look ahead, and this comes up in terms of our ability to serve transportation, yes, right now, we are--we have locked in sales for that long position but with proper planning, we have the ability to change our strategy based on increased load.",116,,
510,0.97,4167.029,4176.405,"So that's why sometimes, you get a nuance answer from us when you ask, do you have the capacity to certain transportation?",116,,
511,0.97,4176.472,4176.705,That's why.,116,,
512,0.97,4176.772,4177.473,And the other --,116,,
513,0.97,4177.54,4212.041,And I believe that planning based on conversations that we had towards the end of the year around the Councilmember's proposed legislation that you anticipate sufficient load as well should the Council at a later date decided to require new developments to not allow for natural gas heating and that you have that overtime as well?,117,,
514,0.97,4212.107,4224.853,"We request--can do a whole session on power supply, and I would love to at sometime, but can you stand up for just a second?",118,,
515,0.97,4224.92,4228.824,This is Tom Davore and he just joined us.,118,,
516,0.97,4228.891,4229.959,Is this week 2?,118,,
517,0.97,4230.025,4232.227,Yeah,119,,
518,0.97,4232.294,4235.264,"And Tom--Yeah, exactly.",120,,
519,0.97,4235.331,4254.483,"Tom will be replacing although no one can replace Lynne, our environmental officer but we have hired Tom to fill in the role and he has an extensive power supply background with a lot of talented folks in the organization.",120,,
520,0.97,4254.55,4254.75,"So, yes.",120,,
521,0.97,4254.817,4263.158,Not only are there--we have a long-term contract with the power administration.,120,,
522,0.97,4263.225,4266.829,And there is another slide and I'll talk about that.,120,,
523,0.97,4266.895,4269.398,"But the Federal system, they look at load.",120,,
524,0.97,4269.465,4272.935,"When we talk about load, we mean the load on the system.",120,,
525,0.97,4273.002,4284.046,So at any point in time the load is how much power is our cumulative load at any point in time.,120,,
526,0.97,4284.113,4286.315,That's the system load.,120,,
527,0.97,4286.382,4303.165,The way Bonneville ALLOCATES resources is they look at your projected load and then take a look at what you have access to and take that back and put everything in the hopper and allocate on that basis.,120,,
528,0.97,4303.232,4310.939,We currently are in a contract with Bonneville that ends in 20 2028.,120,,
529,0.97,4311.006,4323.819,"But as we look ahead, particularly of the transportation industry, Bonneville will have different--the various utilities that receive power from Bonneville, those loads will change.",120,,
530,0.97,4323.886,4329.625,We will have ability to have access.,120,,
531,0.97,4329.692,4346.108,"That's the long version and the other thing I want to mention before I moved off this slide, it's not listed on the priority slide because we are so close to being done, and many of you have heard about the Eim.",120,,
532,0.97,4346.175,4383.712,"We have worked through our committee and Council through a number of years in a very thoughtful, careful process that has received multiple--there were multiple milestones where we have brought legislation to the Council for action, and the last piece of legislation this last fall, and we are entering the market that allows you to buy and sell power in very short intervals.",120,,
533,0.97,4383.779,4398.06,"You know, the hourly variations and what that will do for us is, it will allow us to get more value back to the clearance by selling into California.",120,,
534,0.97,4398.127,4403.165,So California has a very interesting load curve because they have so much solar.,120,,
535,0.97,4403.232,4415.978,So they have so much solar in the middle of the day and then Úthe sun goes down and suddenly they have significantly less.,120,,
536,0.97,4416.044,4423.285,"And their state standards, ther renewable portfolio standards are like Washington, requiring utilities to get ever more green.",120,,
537,0.97,4423.352,4435.197,"So their struggle is when everybody comes home at the end of the day and wants to start the dryer, Cook dinner and put their kids in the bath, that's the time when the sun is going down, and there is no power.",120,,
538,0.97,4435.264,4447.576,So our thought is we have this position and we'll be able to sell into those times--we call them shoulder times--when we have the most value.,120,,
539,0.97,4447.643,4473.802,"Part of our strategy around that, that you will be very involved in as we work through the strategic planning process is to offer time of day rates where we can use less power during those times of day when that power has the most value in the market.",120,,
540,0.97,4473.869,4477.94,"So kind of again, it's where the industry is heading.",120,,
541,0.97,4478.006,4485.614,We would have been the first public utility to enter the Eim but Sacramento beat us.,120,,
542,0.97,4485.681,4486.048,We deferred.,120,,
543,0.97,4486.114,4499.862,"We needed to put in a new energy trading and risk management system and it went super well, and we are in the final stages of the Eim implementation.",120,,
544,0.97,4499.928,4512.774,"And the California independent system operator, they come up here every other month, and we're the postal child for the implementation is going L it's not an Afterthought.",120,,
545,0.97,4512.841,4524.319,"We think about it all the time but it's not requiring a lot of attention because it's going very, very well.",120,,
546,0.97,4524.386,4529.024,And it's only on April 1. so you join a group going forward.,120,,
547,0.97,4529.091,4533.428,So there is a group of utilities that will go April 1 of 2021.,120,,
548,0.97,4533.495,4536.098,So they in an earlier stage.,120,,
549,0.97,4536.164,4540.369,I believe Tacoma power just announced their intention to join.,120,,
550,0.97,4540.435,4549.278,"I believe they are going in 2020--when is it, Tom?",120,,
551,0.97,4549.344,4549.478,2022.,120,,
552,0.97,4549.544,4552.581,"So for the Ratepayer, what does that mean?",121,,
553,0.97,4552.648,4556.285,Does it mean something for April?,121,,
554,0.97,4556.351,4556.718,No.,122,,
555,0.97,4556.785,4565.027,"It just means that in April, we will begin to trade in the Eim and energy and balance market.",122,,
556,0.97,4565.093,4578.974,"Then the goal is to bring you new rate structure as, again, part of the work that we are on right now and then the new rate structures could go into effect January 1 of 2021.",122,,
557,0.97,4579.041,4584.413,"That's where hopefully, we would begin to really develop strong financial value.",122,,
558,0.97,4584.479,4599.728,"But again, it's financial but overtime should help to improve our wholesale refer--revenues and offsets the customer, and it provides a benefit to all of our customers.",122,,
559,0.97,4599.795,4600.262,Thank you.,123,,
560,0.97,4600.329,4605.434,Thank you for being innovative on that and looking down the Pacific Coast and how to maximize that.,123,,
561,0.97,4605.5,4612.374,"I would love to take credit for it, but it's the people that came before me here at Seattle city light so thank you.",124,,
562,0.97,4612.441,4614.876,So I'm not next slide now.,124,,
563,0.97,4614.943,4617.679,So this is our sources of power.,124,,
564,0.97,4617.746,4625.52,"So, on, we do generate a significant amount of resource and the capacity to generate.",124,,
565,0.97,4625.587,4639.668,The name plate rating on the facility in total is 21--2.1--I'm saying this wrong.,124,,
566,0.97,4639.735,4641.303,It's 2--2000 Megawatts.,124,,
567,0.97,4641.37,4646.808,In reality especially in the summer and especially you talked about climate impacts.,124,,
568,0.97,4646.875,4655.717,"You know, it is hard to know, but we certainly have seen lower generations from some of our facilities.",124,,
569,0.97,4655.784,4696.992,"This last summer, Skagit, one of our large facilities, we were never actually able to open the recreational facilities because the water levels were so low, and we do think about that all the time and think as we begin our Re- licensing with Skagit, for instance, are mindful that the long-term position and city light position is we lead with environmental stewardship but as we approach the Relicensing process we have to be mindful of the Economics of the negotiations simply because the output or generation of the facility is less.",124,,
570,0.97,4697.059,4705.1,"So we, as I said, we are blessed with significant Hydropower resources of our own.",124,,
571,0.97,4705.167,4716.778,"In 2018, 60% of the power and we are the second largest customer of the Bonneville power location.",124,,
572,0.97,4716.845,4731.993,"And I am chair, and it's the major trade Association, and I believe there are 80 some who are members in PPC.",124,,
573,0.97,4732.06,4733.728,Bonneville is a PMA.,124,,
574,0.97,4733.795,4735.697,It's a power marketing agency.,124,,
575,0.97,4735.764,4748.009,So the Army Corps of engineers and Bureau of reclamation own facilities.,124,,
576,0.97,4748.076,4752.514,Bonneville is charged with really two things.,124,,
577,0.97,4752.581,4776.171,Marketing that power and protecting the species and folks impacted by the presence of the dam so they work hard to balance their Stewardhip stewardship and maximize revenues on the power customer.,124,,
578,0.97,4776.238,4778.44,So Bonneville has 31 Federal dams.,124,,
579,0.97,4778.507,4781.309,You hear about them most often.,124,,
580,0.97,4781.376,4784.112,They are the lower Columbia and lower snake River dams.,124,,
581,0.97,4784.179,4794.689,I think most of us are aware there is a lot of controversy about the lower snake River dam.,124,,
582,0.97,4794.756,4803.265,"Again, we could have a great conversation, but it's something that I am personally involved in and spending time on.",124,,
583,0.97,4803.331,4813.074,There is one nuclear plant and non-Federal power plants.,124,,
584,0.97,4813.141,4821.616,We use Bonneville transmission to bring power to load from our boundary facility.,124,,
585,0.97,4821.683,4822.617,So that's that slide.,124,,
586,0.97,4822.684,4826.121,"Top priorities, so this is kind of a mix.",124,,
587,0.97,4826.188,4832.294,These are all priorities that were contained in the last strategic plan.,124,,
588,0.97,4832.36,4842.704,"But I--since I inherited a plan, what I did is I pulled out a number of them that to me were focused on.",124,,
589,0.97,4842.771,4843.705,It's a heavy lift.,124,,
590,0.97,4843.772,4845.574,We have a lot going on.,124,,
591,0.97,4845.64,4855.55,We have a lot to do.,124,,
592,0.97,4855.617,4859.721,Transportation Electification is probably the biggest thing from us.,124,,
593,0.97,4859.788,4865.76,We settled on a name.,124,,
594,0.97,4865.827,4867.162,Transportation Electification strategic plan.,125,,
595,0.97,4867.229,4898.36,"So that's the plan that you as our governing body is--that's what we are required to present and obtain approval as part of the bill that will allow us to provide incentives for transportation Electification enter elect--infrastructure, not cars or bikes but the infrastructure.",126,,
596,0.97,4898.426,4903.665,And we can provide that similar to customers similar to the energy efficiency today.,126,,
597,0.97,4903.732,4908.536,We are developing a plan that will come to you for consideration and hopefully approval.,126,,
598,0.97,4908.603,4909.104,That needs to help.,126,,
599,0.97,4909.17,4920.615,That is the first step before we can move forward with the new authority that was granted under the legislation.,126,,
600,0.97,4920.682,4940.235,"Just for clarification sake, are you, as it relates to the authority granted by the state Legislature, are you also considering the port transportation facilities as part of that initiative?",127,,
601,0.97,4940.302,4941.936,"Yes, absolutely.",128,,
602,0.97,4942.003,4962.157,"As we look to transportation Electification opportunities for the city of Seattle and city light, we are--we are very focused on mass transit and public transportation and ferries, buses, et set--et cetera.",128,,
603,0.97,4962.223,4968.396,"I drive an electric vehicle, and I drive it very, very rarely in Seattle.",128,,
604,0.97,4968.463,4981.943,"We recognize that the bang for our Buck environmentally and from a load perspective, and we'll talk about that is around public transportation.",128,,
605,0.97,4982.01,4997.659,"So modernizing operational technology, and some of that is around getting things ready for Electricification, the grid and we talked about the increasing loads related to transportation.",129,,
606,0.97,4997.726,5002.964,We know that we have distribution system constraints along I-5 and other places.,129,,
607,0.97,5003.031,5003.998,They are Solvable.,129,,
608,0.97,5004.065,5010.071,Everyone has them but that's part of what that is about.,129,,
609,0.97,5010.138,5020.181,"And implementing the small service, cell permit process.",129,,
610,0.97,5020.248,5027.355,And that is another area to brief you.,129,,
611,0.97,5027.422,5032.06,"It's good government, quite honestly.",129,,
612,0.97,5032.127,5042.17,It's working it could to be responsive to the carriers but is more efficient and effective within the departments.,129,,
613,0.97,5042.237,5048.877,"Accelerate utility pole replacements, I think everyone knows that we had 26 poles that came down last spring.",129,,
614,0.97,5048.943,5051.012,We have been working hard to develop a plan.,129,,
615,0.97,5051.079,5064.426,"This will be a priority for us, and from the capital improvement plan perspective, it's probably the number one priority.",129,,
616,0.97,5064.492,5075.837,We have been--our CIP looks very different looking ahead as we create space for the investment required.,129,,
617,0.97,5075.904,5076.838,I mentioned Skagit Hydropower.,129,,
618,0.97,5076.905,5080.375,You will hear about that quite a bit.,129,,
619,0.97,5080.442,5091.753,Our first action is to file a preliminary application about the licensing approach we intend to take.,129,,
620,0.97,5091.82,5096.658,That will help Q 1 here coming up soon.,129,,
621,0.97,5096.724,5108.636,"But as our new governing body, you know, joint--I don't want to be overly optimistic.",129,,
622,0.97,5108.703,5124.219,"It's a long party, and the Stakeholders that we have great relationships with, and we will continue those relationships with this negotiation, and Lastly, enhancing the employee experience.",129,,
623,0.97,5124.285,5149.477,"That is not last because none of those things will happen without a workforce that can't come to work and to their best every day, and we are mindful of that particularly with best practice management skills and really, holding the officers--me, officers, directors, managers, supervisors responsibility for creating the environment where employees can do their best.",129,,
624,0.97,5149.544,5158.253,Just a question going back to the transportation Electricification.,130,,
625,0.97,5158.319,5172.734,"The question about the utilities in the infrastructure and the question of investments that the property owners wish to make to allow for Electricification, namely charging stations.",130,,
626,0.97,5172.8,5191.653,I have a number of constituents at Puget ridge Co-Housing who are seeking a variance on a 3- year-old policy that you only allow for a drop in a single --,130,,
627,0.97,5191.719,5191.986,"Yes, yes.",131,,
628,0.97,5192.053,5196.991,Is that something you are willing to take another look at?,132,,
629,0.97,5197.058,5197.358,Absolutely.,133,,
630,0.97,5197.425,5215.109,"We are in the process of developing a variance prose for where we call it 1 site, 1 service, and a variance that will deal with clearance between city light's rules and the state.",133,,
631,0.97,5215.176,5227.689,"That's part of quite honestly couple member, a big part of being a customer as a utility and understanding that customers have rights.",133,,
632,0.97,5227.755,5228.156,Thank you.,134,,
633,0.97,5228.222,5233.328,"Next slide, I am going to focus on our programs.",134,,
634,0.97,5233.394,5242.07,I think the folks did a great job of talking on the process improvement efforts we have been working through together.,134,,
635,0.97,5242.136,5260.855,"So the Disconnection prevention program is one we are involved in, and we have our own pilot we are working on and many areas that they discussed are efforts that human services, city light and Spu have been working on together.",134,,
636,0.97,5260.922,5286.114,"We have one of the most generous low-income rate programs in the country, and all of the customers support the program, 60% for electric bills, and in addition to rate discount, we offer all the residential customers access to payment plans if they are struggling with a larger than unusual bill or unexpected financial hardship.",134,,
637,0.97,5286.18,5292.186,We have been Reworking our Department policy to clarification a great deal of flexibility.,134,,
638,0.97,5292.253,5306.834,I think a challenge for us as an organization and a city is to empower employees to help customers with that 1-Call resolution at the same time maintain adequate controls.,134,,
639,0.97,5306.901,5312.34,I will own that is something we are still trying to figure out and we are making progress.,134,,
640,0.97,5312.407,5320.481,"But the pilots that we are doing, the energy equity rate pilot, and it says fall 2020.",134,,
641,0.97,5320.548,5326.721,"It's really fall 2019 but then in all honesty, we are still in the process of signing customers up.",134,,
642,0.97,5326.788,5338.099,"So basically, what our program does is it looks at--it's designed to serve and provide benefit to the lowest income customers.",134,,
643,0.97,5338.166,5345.973,"So typically a customer that makes in the $25,000 range per year.",134,,
644,0.97,5346.04,5356.417,"So in the--if you look nationwide, the average energy burden is around 4% because we have lower rates than most parts of the country.",134,,
645,0.97,5356.484,5359.32,We use a different number.,134,,
646,0.97,5359.387,5368.096,The idea here is to say we want the lowest income customers to have a similar energy burden as you or I might have.,134,,
647,0.97,5368.162,5370.031,We are using 6% as that number.,134,,
648,0.97,5370.098,5378.339,"So what happens is if they sign up for the program, we--we--they will qualify for a fixed rate.",134,,
649,0.97,5378.406,5380.174,There is no fixed charge.,134,,
650,0.97,5380.241,5382.443,There is no tiered rates.,134,,
651,0.97,5382.51,5391.052,Our typical rate structure has tiers where you play less for the first block of power and more if you use more.,134,,
652,0.97,5391.119,5394.922,It's a flat rate without a fixed charge.,134,,
653,0.97,5394.989,5414.976,"It's quite low, and it--the result of the rate--this was one of the things that took longer, because UTP offers already a discount we wanted to provide more than the existing Udp program.",134,,
654,0.97,5415.042,5428.389,"So that's what it does, and then one of the really nice things, and a lot of the customers are people with Past- due bills, and so the notion is that you enter a relationship with them.",134,,
655,0.97,5428.456,5453.981,"We are going into their homes and doing as much energy efficiency as we can, and we are looking at solving long- term problems as well, and then at the end of the day, using Customer-Donated funds, if the customer is able to make their perspective payments and keep those current, we offer forgiveness at an Agreed- period.",134,,
656,0.97,5454.048,5457.418,They have a lower rate and a fresh start.,134,,
657,0.97,5457.485,5482.276,"Right now, this program is electric only but I think when we talk with Spu and city light and partners on the Udp we think about learning from each other and trying different things with the different utilities that ultimately can be offered either place.",134,,
658,0.97,5482.343,5482.777,Thank you,135,,
659,0.97,5482.844,5489.283,The rest of my presentation will touch on the strategic plan and planning process.,136,,
660,0.97,5489.35,5498.86,The purpose is to road map new customer needs driven by our mission values.,136,,
661,0.97,5498.926,5501.395,I'm super excited.,136,,
662,0.97,5501.462,5504.365,This is my first strategic plan.,136,,
663,0.97,5504.432,5513.074,I inherited one and I am excited to develop a new road map for 2021-2026.,136,,
664,0.97,5513.14,5520.648,"Background, 2012 was the first year that we did a strategic plan with the review panel.",136,,
665,0.97,5520.715,5532.126,It created--it was a 6-year business plan and sets the foundation for our By-Annual budget and endorses a rate pass.,136,,
666,0.97,5532.193,5543.337,"They provide input on the strategic plan, 9-Panel of volunteer members.",136,,
667,0.97,5543.404,5546.607,"The Mayor APPOINTS some, the Council APPOINTS some.",136,,
668,0.97,5546.674,5555.783,This is the first time we have incorporated scenic plans.,136,,
669,0.97,5555.85,5558.886,And we have someone who is very good at creating a future.,136,,
670,0.97,5558.953,5569.03,And one of those was the future around climate change and what if climate change is the thing that happens much faster and is Impactful?,136,,
671,0.97,5569.096,5579.106,"You start out with the futures, and we look at 3 of them and come back and say what do I need to do today to provide this potential future scenario?",136,,
672,0.97,5579.173,5580.041,That's where we are.,136,,
673,0.97,5580.107,5587.848,"If you could go to the next slide, this is just a little more information about who's on the review panel.",136,,
674,0.97,5587.915,5592.353,"You do have a vacancy, and we had conversation already.",136,,
675,0.97,5592.42,5615.042,"So there is an opportunity to identify I think a financial analyst position that the city could bring forward, and we would love to have than sooner rather than later because we are in the midst of the planning process and welcome the diverse feedback from the various constituents of the review panel.",136,,
676,0.97,5615.109,5627.655,"So where we're at right now, we're in the thick of things and on track to bring you a 2021-2026 strategic plan in the early summer.",136,,
677,0.97,5627.722,5656.717,"Immediately following the adopt, we will bring you the 2021 and 2022, the first two years of the plan that would be adopted before the Council under takes the process.",136,,
678,0.97,5656.784,5674.468,"In 2017 we built a forecast sales model that incorporated new coding standards and upgraded Technologies like L.E.D.S, solar panels, and electric vehicles and relevant factors like climate change.",136,,
679,0.97,5674.535,5683.744,"You can see that the new plan shows loads decreasing, and they can been decreasing for a number of years.",136,,
680,0.97,5683.811,5693.387,The most recent load forecast has been updated since the one Referenced here shows that loads don't start to increase again.,136,,
681,0.97,5693.454,5700.461,The load forecast doesn't bend and start to move up until 2031- 2032.,136,,
682,0.97,5700.528,5720.648,"That's really as a result of that's the point at which Electricification, our assumptions around transportation Electricification become greater than the continuing load decrease which is associated with all the things we talked about.",136,,
683,0.97,5720.714,5720.948,It's funny.,136,,
684,0.97,5721.015,5732.326,"You guys understand this but when I talk with groups, they see Seattle and see all the growth and how can your loads be decreasing?",136,,
685,0.97,5732.393,5750.611,"I think it's because--I know it's because as we have rebuilt this city, the property we take down to make way for the new are use essentially more energy than their incredibly more dense replacements.",136,,
686,0.97,5750.678,5769.897,"We take down a smaller--same foot print, not as high perhaps, and they are so efficient today that they will use less energy.",136,,
687,0.97,5769.964,5772.399,It's a very interesting place to be.,136,,
688,0.97,5772.466,5779.006,Employees are dealing with all the growth and impacts of growth.,136,,
689,0.97,5779.073,5793.02,It's huge even while the loads and revenues that would support the growth in many cities are on the decline.,136,,
690,0.97,5793.087,5793.32,Next slide.,136,,
691,0.97,5793.387,5794.655,This is just information.,136,,
692,0.97,5794.722,5808.169,Mora and I were in the audience recognizing this would have been information this was input into the strategic plan approved in summer of 2018.,136,,
693,0.97,5808.235,5812.206,But it's still interesting in terms of what's important to customers?,136,,
694,0.97,5812.273,5816.076,What is most important to customers?,136,,
695,0.97,5816.143,5829.99,"I wouldn't have expected this to change, class concerns are number one, and the energy independence is number 2. and then reliability.",136,,
696,0.97,5830.057,5841.835,Infrastructure and improvements are key to Reliability and that matters to us more and more as we are more dependent on devices.,136,,
697,0.97,5841.902,5843.103,Reliability is most important.,136,,
698,0.97,5843.17,5849.51,And we know that because they have increasingly sensitive electronics and technology.,136,,
699,0.97,5849.577,5853.047,It isn't just like large manufacturing.,136,,
700,0.97,5853.113,5855.249,It's the new buildings going up.,136,,
701,0.97,5855.316,5863.19,They have elevator systems and control systems within the building that are extremely sensitive.,136,,
702,0.97,5863.257,5869.496,So cost is still a concern.,136,,
703,0.97,5869.563,5871.899,But reliability is most important.,136,,
704,0.97,5871.966,5878.072,"In 2020, we do participate in JP powers, and at times, we have briefed the Council.",136,,
705,0.97,5878.138,5880.241,It's not a free story right now.,136,,
706,0.97,5880.307,5885.145,"You know, so we have a lot of opportunity with respect to our Jd power ratings.",136,,
707,0.97,5885.212,5899.426,One of the things we are doing this year to have in granular information to underline that is we will be doing a customer satisfaction survey in 2020.,136,,
708,0.97,5899.493,5921.348,The plan going forward is every other year we will survey customers and have a statistically valid survey and this was not so we'll have a much better and more current touch point on how the customers and employees are feeling about their utility.,136,,
709,0.97,5921.415,5923.417,Thank you.,137,,
710,0.97,5923.484,5926.086,"Any questions, colleagues?",137,,
711,0.97,5926.153,5926.587,"Well, thank you.",137,,
712,0.97,5926.654,5937.464,"I just want to--I think it's really important for us Newbies, probably the newest ones --",138,,
713,0.97,5937.531,5940.768,We have briefed Council before.,139,,
714,0.97,5940.834,5968.996,"I really appreciate you sharing all of this and what you just said about the Futurey--future scenarios, and climate change is not a scenario that you choose from but a framework that needs to be part of the planning.",140,,
715,0.97,5969.063,5971.498,"Yes, and it is.",141,,
716,0.97,5971.565,5972.633,"What year, Mora?",141,,
717,0.97,5972.7,5982.309,"In the first strategic plan, we have a climate adaptation plan, and we are getting ready for the first update of the plan.",142,,
718,0.97,5982.376,5986.413,"We have a full--vulnerability assessment, 100 pages.",142,,
719,0.97,5986.48,5989.149,Happy to send it to you.,142,,
720,0.97,5989.216,5991.418,It's a model plan.,142,,
721,0.97,5991.485,5991.719,Yeah.,143,,
722,0.97,5991.785,5992.92,Very important to us.,143,,
723,0.97,5992.986,5995.489,Any other questions?,144,,
724,0.97,5995.556,5996.824,Thank you.,145,,
725,0.97,5996.89,5997.524,Thank you.,146,,
726,0.97,5997.591,6000.694,"Committee members, we have a lot of work to do.",146,,
727,0.97,6000.761,6005.799,That's just 3 out of 4 departments that we will be working with.,146,,
728,0.97,6005.866,6006.767,We will be very busy.,146,,
729,0.97,6006.834,6008.268,Please let us know.,147,,
730,0.97,6008.335,6011.238,We are happy to sit and brief you and your staff.,147,,
731,0.97,6011.305,6014.641,Our goal is for you all to be energy Geeks.,147,,
732,0.97,6014.708,6015.242,Thank you.,148,,
733,0.97,6015.309,6016.009,Thank you.,149,,
734,0.97,6016.076,6023.25,That was our final item.,150,,
735,0.97,6023.317,6032.659,"Before you adjourn, I want to make a couple of comments.",151,,
736,0.97,6032.726,6053.847,"This is a really important committee and a very large Committee, and I have spent a lot of time working on a more robust approach for the Council to exercise oversight and accountability of our capital improvement plan.",151,,
737,0.97,6053.914,6070.23,And our ability really to be successful at that from my perspective has been bounded by sharing the load in a way that is equitable across all committees.,151,,
738,0.97,6070.297,6077.871,We tonight have a structure to do that and we will all have to work harder.,151,,
739,0.97,6077.938,6093.02,"This committee not only has the responsibility of 5000 to 12,000 city Imblowees but 7,443,000,000 of 1.4 billion in capital investments for 2020.",151,,
740,0.97,6093.086,6125.452,"So, it's really important that I believe that we bring that commitment to oversight and accountability to the work that we do because it is--it is true that the--some of the projects associated with priority years' Critiques around oversight and cost overruns have been projects in this committee portfolio.",151,,
741,0.97,6125.519,6129.256,I think it's a really big responsibility.,151,,
742,0.97,6129.323,6134.261,And I appreciate the chair's willingness to take it on,151,,
743,0.97,6134.328,6136.296,Yes.,152,,
744,0.97,6136.363,6136.497,Yes.,152,,
745,0.97,6136.563,6137.731,Accountability is key.,152,,
746,0.97,6137.798,6146.64,Your cap tap projects' watch list you set up will be helpful to the committee.,152,,
747,0.97,6146.707,6148.642,And effectively use the information we get.,153,,
748,0.97,6148.709,6160.621,"One other thing I want to pass on to you, this is work from Seattle public utilities that I hope you take into consideration.",153,,
749,0.97,6160.687,6163.59,We often talk about impact fees.,153,,
750,0.97,6163.657,6170.264,We talk impact fees and usually transportation or parks or school impact fees.,153,,
751,0.97,6170.33,6184.311,"Those are called impact fees in state law we are authorized to implement, and there is a system development charge for water and wastewater and drainage.",153,,
752,0.97,6184.378,6201.562,"Just like the transportation impact fees, it's not fully implementing our ability to fully recover the costs for the Ratepayers.",153,,
753,0.97,6201.628,6211.405,The failure has contributed to higher rate costs.,153,,
754,0.97,6211.471,6234.361,"Seattle public utilities delivered papers that do analysis around this work because of the Lateness in the term for me, summer, and then the budget, so we haven't within able to follow up on this work, and I would love the opportunity to work with you.",153,,
755,0.97,6234.428,6240.634,Some of the concerns relate to the impacts of these types of charges on affordable housing.,153,,
756,0.97,6240.701,6246.773,I think there is good analysis about how to mitigate it.,153,,
757,0.97,6246.84,6252.312,I do want to highlight it would likely have to be Council- driven work.,153,,
758,0.97,6252.379,6265.792,The executive in June when they delivered that work declined as it relates to their interest in driving it forward because of their concerns around impact Affordability.,153,,
759,0.97,6265.859,6270.464,I think we can with the good analysis take that on.,153,,
760,0.97,6270.53,6272.432,That's great.,154,,
