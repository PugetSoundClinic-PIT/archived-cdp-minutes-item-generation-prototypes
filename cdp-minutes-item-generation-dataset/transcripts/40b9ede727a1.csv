37,0.97,154.621,163.163,Remains a strong attack of the city council tab remote public comment regularly included on the Agendas.,20,,
38,0.97,163.163,166.966,However as a reminder the city council reserves the right to end or remove these public comment periods.,20,,
39,0.97,166.966,171.905,If we deem the system is being abused or is no longer suitable allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively.,20,,
40,0.97,171.905,173.206,I'll moderate in the following manner.,20,,
41,0.97,173.206,182.148,"The public comment for this meeting was noted to be 20 minutes, with each speaking two minutes.",20,,
42,0.97,182.148,194.394,"We do have a little over 30 speakers signed up to give public comment today, so I would like to extend the public comment period to a total of 30 minutes.",20,,

47,0.97,215.615,219.919,This will hopefully allow us to get through a vast majority of those who have registered for public comment this morning.,20,,
48,0.97,219.919,223.423,"This afternoon, excuse me.",20,,
49,0.97,223.423,227.694,Speakers will be called on in the order in which you registered to provide public comment on the Council's Website.,20,,

58,0.97,278.845,295.061,"Can I request, since they are only--since I'm assuming that there are only a few more as you said them 30 signed up, I would request that we take all of them because we don't have a long agenda today.",21,,
59,0.97,295.061,295.895,We've only a few appointments.,21,,
60,0.97,295.895,300.099,I'm worried that tenants from raider court will be cut from the public comment.,21,,

66,0.97,321.02,323.79,"Then, the Speaker must press Star six before speaking.",24,,
67,0.97,323.79,326.025,"Again, I'm going to call your name.",24,,
68,0.97,326.025,335.635,"You're going to hear an automated prompt that you have been Un-Muted and after you hear that automatic prompt, you should then press Star, that is Star, six.",24,,

70,0.97,339.138,349.215,"Please start by stating your name, the item you're addressing, and as a reminder the public, should relate to an item on today's agenda, the Ntroduction and referral calendar, or the Council's work program.",24,,

79,0.97,400.266,403.169,Good afternoon.,25,,
80,0.97,403.169,407.874,District 7 speaking on the budget and failed police accountability.,25,,
81,0.97,407.874,422.422,"So far in the budget process the Council has not touched the nearly $30 million spent on the pretense of police accountability, maintaining all the current aspects of the police investigating police full accountability system.",25,,
82,0.97,422.422,430.196,"Outrageously, this Council plans to actually increase the budget for public records disclosure person.",25,,
83,0.97,430.196,435.535,This indicates a complete Disconnect between the Council and the reality of what is happening now at the Oig.,25,,
84,0.97,435.535,453.352,One of the many complaints that two high-level Whistleblowers from the Oig have made is that the Oig director consistently hides the actions of her office by demanding that Oig staff not document in writing any concerns or disagreements with OPA investments in and attempt to subvert.,25,,
85,0.97,453.352,457.657,This is an abject failure of Council oversight.,25,,
86,0.97,457.657,460.76,We must invest these monies in a system providing full community control over police.,25,,
87,0.97,460.76,463.162,Go to Seattle Stop.Org to find out how.,25,,
88,0.97,463.162,464.564,Seattle Stop.Org.,25,,

93,0.97,495.228,499.365,I heard about it from Councilmember Shamus Sawant's office.,27,,
94,0.97,499.365,518.017,"I went to a tenants meeting their just three nights ago on Friday night and her just absolutely insane stop code violations, $100 rent increases, a woman with Sickle cell anemia's rent is being raised $240.",27,,
95,0.97,518.017,522.121,People have spoken out and have been intimidated by the property manager and maintenance.,27,,
96,0.97,522.121,524.924,It is a dire situation in the city council needs to speak out.,27,,
97,0.97,524.924,534.834,"I think it is striking that Councilwoman Sawant, even though she is not the District 2 city council got an Email from the direct of S.E.E.D.",27,,
98,0.97,534.834,535.635,Asking for a meeting.,27,,
99,0.97,535.635,537.036,The shows that organizing works.,27,,
100,0.97,537.036,544.11,I really strongly urge the other city counselors to sign on to the letter.,27,,
101,0.97,544.11,547.947,"It will be more powerful if it comes from a bunch of people, not individual counselors.",27,,

103,0.97,550.216,556.122,Next up.,28,,

112,0.97,612.011,618.117,It says bad conditions in here.,31,,
113,0.97,618.117,620.62,"So, I don't know why these people are still here.",31,,
114,0.97,620.62,621.52,Anyway.,31,,

119,0.97,640.706,656.222,Two Mondays ago all the Democrats on the city council shamefully attempted to silence workers like myself and Councilmember Sawant who has brought forward the legislation to make contracted officers fully paid for construction worker parking.,33,,
120,0.97,656.222,669.935,"Hundreds of workers pushed back calling back using bureaucratic rules against Councilmember Sawant to prevent her from even describing the legislation, which are office developed after consulting with Rank-And- file union members.",33,,
121,0.97,669.935,673.639,Those city council members have failed to say even one word in support of this legislation.,33,,
122,0.97,673.639,680.746,Even though most of you call yourselves labor friendly progresses.,33,,
123,0.97,680.746,686.352,What you did at the meeting on October 18th only help the contractor bosses to exploit us and make us pay to have to go to work.,33,,
124,0.97,686.352,690.589,"Hundreds of community members, many of them can structure workers send Email to the Councilmembers calling them out on these tactics.",33,,
125,0.97,690.589,696.629,"Thanks to this bold action by workers, the city council Democrats have been forced to partially concede and now have to consider the parking ordinance.",33,,
126,0.97,696.629,698.164,I urge politicians do not delay on this.,33,,
127,0.97,698.164,700.366,There is no excuse for any further --,33,,

153,0.97,822.755,828.694,"However, the involvement by the city has taken far, far EK too long.",38,,
154,0.97,828.694,835.634,Calls and letters from concerned community members with responses that only casts about and blame each other.,38,,

233,0.97,1284.983,1299.064,"But after what happened on October 18th, when the Democrats on the city council silenced Councilmember Sawant and silenced construction workers in Seattle who were paying for parking, I had to call in.",54,,
234,0.97,1299.064,1301.299,It was just absolutely outrageous.,54,,
235,0.97,1301.299,1307.506,You need to pass Councilmember Sawant's legislation for paid parking for all construction workers without delay.,54,,
236,0.97,1307.506,1311.009,I don't want to hear anymore excuses.,54,,

238,0.97,1318.817,1322.688,But you can cancel last Monday's meeting.,54,,
239,0.97,1322.688,1333.532,Stop trying to avoid this issue because you would rather that these Million-Dollar corporations get away with not paying their workers parking.,54,,

256,0.97,1427.125,1430.028,I'm glad that we have a Councilmember in office who helps ordinary people organize.,57,,

258,0.97,1433.598,1436.434,We cannot ask nicely because they continue to ignore and come up with excuses.,57,,
259,0.97,1436.434,1447.913,"So, if the Democrats on the city council do not even sign this letter, which is the least they can do, they would be failing to stand with the most vulnerable people in our city.",57,,
