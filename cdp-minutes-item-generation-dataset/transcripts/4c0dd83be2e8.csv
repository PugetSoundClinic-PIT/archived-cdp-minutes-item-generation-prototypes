128,0.97,653.052,659.925,I can now breathe easier knowing that things are in good hands.,50,,
129,0.97,659.925,664.363,I am still concerned about the housing situation.,50,,
130,0.97,664.363,674.34,"But, at the rate of speed at which the new administration is getting things done, I'm not nearly as worried as I have when the emergency was declared for housing, what, six years ago?",50,,
131,0.97,674.34,678.811,I also want to give a shout out to chief Diaz.,50,,
132,0.97,678.811,683.482,He is doing a remarkable job with a mostly reduced staff.,50,,

144,0.97,731.197,740.139,We urge voting yes on 120207 which requires tree providers to register with our city.,52,,
145,0.97,740.139,759.959,It's an educational step that requires them to be familiar and comply with the existing Trico detection and provide three business days notice to the public for examination.,52,,
146,0.97,761.527,767.166,This bill also requires providers to have adequate insurance and workers COMP to protect their own employees just in case of an accident.,52,,
147,0.97,767.166,780.88,The tree registration is fee and it represents a collaboration of several versions which also provide opportunities for all of the providers to comply by using resources and expert such as Arborists.,52,,
148,0.97,780.88,785.184,We urge you to vote yes today to save the trees and it's these trees that may save us.,52,,

157,0.97,827.693,833.999,"We need to, however, move on beyond this to pass the other provisions of the resolution.",54,,
158,0.97,833.999,842.841,"An example is, this morning starting at 9:00 still ongoing there is a Chainsaw, a tree company working in the neighborhood cutting down trees.",54,,
159,0.97,842.841,852.384,"When I went out to check one of the trees is a large Cedar tree, 70 feet tall that when I asked was ""being topped"".",54,,
160,0.97,852.384,859.391,Topping is not a standard practice that you're supposed to do for saving trees.,54,,
161,0.97,859.391,861.427,They didn't know the diameter of the tree.,54,,
162,0.97,861.427,869.401,"Again, without a permit system and two week notice and posting on-site we still have a complaint based system Unfortunately.",54,,
163,0.97,869.401,876.442,Three days notice doesn't say they are permitted to do this.,54,,
164,0.97,876.442,878.677,It says this is what the company is going to do.,54,,
165,0.97,878.677,880.246,That needs to be clarified.,54,,
166,0.97,880.246,880.913,Thank you.,54,,

178,0.97,925.224,937.403,"I'm here to talk about some of Yur expenditures and point of fact it was $35,000 expect a on legal fees relative to the previous Mayor Durkan.",59,,
179,0.97,937.403,939.838,And she refused even meet with black candidates professionals.,59,,
180,0.97,939.838,951.35,We [Indiscernible] we just wanted a meeting seeing as the Mayor's name is on the city's business equity Department.,59,,
181,0.97,951.35,951.817,It is there.,59,,
182,0.97,951.817,957.556,We didn't get a meeting so we ended up suing to try to find out what was the communication of why did we ever get a meeting.,59,,
183,0.97,957.556,971.103,"And so, the thing is, the city allows the cops and Feds to threaten the blacks out of businesses--under the threat of cycle 502.",59,,
184,0.97,971.103,975.574,That was never the legislative intent or so they say.,59,,
185,0.97,975.574,986.719,These were Grandfathered under the law as medical providers under 1771-11.,59,,

269,0.97,1462.06,1471.937,Given the city's deep commitment to Inclusivity and tolerance I would encourage Seattle to be a leader in tolerance and Inclusivity.,81,,
270,0.97,1471.937,1487.853,"For that reason I'm just strongly, respectfully, encouraging the city of Seattle Council to stand behind their values, to find ways just as Tacoma did to keep the people that have been fired over this mandate.",81,,

330,0.97,1766.131,1768.366,Council bill 120273.,103,,
331,0.97,1768.366,1776.107,"Relating to the Seattle tourism improvement area, modifying the assessment rate and amending ordinance 123714.",103,,
332,0.97,1776.107,1779.677,The committee met Karen recommends the bill pass.,103,,
333,0.97,1779.677,1784.816,Thank you very much.,104,,
334,0.97,1784.816,1803.101,"So, just a brief background for folks that haven't been following this, this bill Effectuates a rate change from two dollars per night to four dollars per night for the Seattle tourism improvement area.",104,,
335,0.97,1803.101,1811.409,The improvement area was formed in 2011 to promote leisure tourism to Seattle.,104,,
336,0.97,1811.409,1833.164,"The rate has remained the same for the past several years, since the very beginning, and this bill was heard first in the Committee on March 9. we discussed the bill further and had a public hearing and voted it out unanimously last week on March 23.",104,,
337,0.97,1833.164,1847.779,"So, I just want to give a little bit of background and say that everyone knows the pandemic has hit Seattle hard, but it has particularly hurt the tourism industry.",104,,
338,0.97,1847.779,1852.65,This doesn't just benefit the hotels.,104,,
339,0.97,1852.65,1859.157,This bill will benefit all of the businesses downtown and across the city the benefit from tourism in Seattle.,104,,
340,0.97,1859.157,1871.135,"The Seattle tourism improvement area is in the downtown core, the waterfront, it comprises about 60 hotels.",104,,
341,0.97,1871.135,1876.407,But visit Seattle which manages the revenue generated by this fee promotes all of Seattle.,104,,
342,0.97,1876.407,1885.183,"So, I'm going to cut to the Chase and say passage of this bill is crucial to our economic recovery and to an Equable economic recovery.",104,,
343,0.97,1885.183,1891.456,Because visit Seattle takes this money and promotes every District of the city.,104,,
344,0.97,1891.456,1905.87,"That means all of the retail shops, bars and restaurants museums entertainment Venues, et cetera, in every neighborhood benefiting from this promotion.",104,,
345,0.97,1905.87,1908.373,That is why I say it is important to our economic recovery.,104,,
346,0.97,1908.373,1917.215,"And as well, the taxes generated from those Enterprises end up going into our general Fund and funding the services we depend on.",104,,
347,0.97,1917.215,1922.52,Not all cities have their fees structured in the same way.,104,,
348,0.97,1922.52,1925.39,Hours is a flat fee.,104,,
349,0.97,1925.39,1936.334,"We are in competition with cities across the country and our neighbor, Portland, has a 2% fee on occupancy in their hotels.",104,,
350,0.97,1936.334,1947.712,That means when a guest goes there 2% of the bill goes to their tourism improvement and promotion area.,104,,
351,0.97,1947.712,1948.78,Ours is a flat fee.,104,,
352,0.97,1948.78,1950.515,It doesn't go up as room rates increase.,104,,
353,0.97,1950.515,1963.161,That is why it is important that we pass this and bring back some more life downtown and generate business and support for businesses across the city.,104,,
