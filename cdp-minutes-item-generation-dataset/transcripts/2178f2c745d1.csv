48,0.97,275.975,280.446,Most of the public's questions are unanswered.,13,,
49,0.97,280.446,286.386,This is partly due to Seattle it not allowing time to ask enough questions.,13,,
50,0.97,286.386,293.159,There is only time to answer three out of 25 questions and many from Maltego.,13,,
51,0.97,293.159,302.635,The other half of the problem was SPD not answering questions saying we will have to get back to you and never did so or provided incorrect information.,13,,
52,0.97,302.635,313.913,It makes no sense that I as a random member of the public will have more of an understanding of the tools than an officer that uses them.,13,,
53,0.97,313.913,318.918,This Implys that SPD doesn't understand the tools or is withholding information.,13,,
54,0.97,318.918,323.823,Regardless the rule is the same.,13,,
55,0.97,323.823,329.762,Spd should not be trusted to operate the surveillance technology.,13,,
56,0.97,329.762,332.665,No technology should be approved by city council.,13,,
57,0.97,332.665,343.71,Please require the public comment period for current or future surveillance technology automatically remain open in one week so the public's questions are answered.,13,,
58,0.97,343.71,370.97,"My written comments it included precise improvements with security, bystander protection, data source, Cofunctionallity, contract all odd why Iting, Scoping, transparency, validation, and this only happens with new Councilmembers voting against the technology or passing the amendments.",13,,

70,0.97,412.211,420.92,We are concerned that it severely limits the public and Councilmembers to meaningful review this technology.,17,,
71,0.97,420.92,438.504,"The purpose of the ordinance is to create Trans Patiencey and without public disclosure, the manufacturer Eveneddor, model name, and number of the Audio recording devices it's impossible to approve this technology.",17,,

75,0.97,467.466,486.018,We are concerned that the city's contract with IBM has not been publically disclosed as I required by the surveillance ordinance with the relationship analysis are likely to generate data errors that compound existing biases.,17,,
76,0.97,486.018,492.058,Spd has said that false connections occur you but have not shared often they occur.,17,,
77,0.97,492.058,504.237,"No limitations on employee access to records, no limits on use of potentially erroneous date and no prohibition of policing.",17,,

169,0.97,1326.558,1332.064,I know there was concern with all the officers having access to these.,36,,
170,0.97,1332.064,1338.837,That is not quite accurate.,36,,
171,0.97,1338.837,1350.182,"The electronic and electrical unit has access, and they are sent out to a detective upon completion of a warrant they have filed with the court.",36,,
172,0.97,1350.182,1362.928,"Upon the completion of the mission, they are collected, and they pull the Audio recordings from that, and they are restored following the guidelines.",36,,
173,0.97,1362.928,1368.066,Unrelated recordings that are irrelevant to the investigation are deleted.,36,,
174,0.97,1368.066,1378.11,So we don't hang on to information that isn't relevant to our investigation and are not covered by the warrant.,36,,
175,0.97,1378.11,1386.852,Audio devices are utilized after the court issued warrants have been in the as required by the privacy act.,36,,
176,0.97,1386.852,1392.391,I know the word consent causes concern and confusion.,36,,
177,0.97,1392.391,1419.017,"The concept is when a person is wearing a recording device or allowing a recording device to be placed within their vehicle or business or homes or areas where they control, they have to give up consent to do so to wear that, Whghter cooperating with an undercover officer who might be doing stuff, and however, to record the conversation with the person who is unaware that they are recorded, we still have to get a warrant from the judge.",36,,
178,0.97,1419.017,1440.839,"And in that warrant, the judge gets to Constrict or restrain what the nature of the recording is and how long the warrant is valid for and what areas the warrant is allowed to record and how long the recording would be allowed to go and all the different stipulation that is the court can place upon us for the use of the recording device.",36,,
179,0.97,1440.839,1448.98,"They maintain the log records, and it's subject to audit by the Oid and the Federal monitor and any other internal audit.",36,,
180,0.97,1448.98,1468.266,"So the controls in place regarding the use of these devices and the deployment of the devices is governed very strictly by the courts and the law, and we can move to the next technology, I'm sorry, the next slide.",36,,
181,0.97,1468.266,1472.404,This is the privacy act that governs the use of the Technologies.,36,,
182,0.97,1472.404,1475.774,And you can see there is quite a list.,36,,
183,0.97,1475.774,1494.559,"The SPD manual covers a great deal of different areas but this technology many other pieces of equipment touch many parts of our manual, and it's rather extensive how we can and can't use it.",36,,
184,0.97,1494.559,1496.061,Next slide.,36,,
185,0.97,1496.061,1508.073,I have crime analyst Spencer Hayne with me to make sure I don't mistake.,36,,
186,0.97,1508.073,1525.957,"We have a technology based Daylighta to display in a manner that allows the detectives to see the relationships between persons, between vehicles and criminal incidents and weapons that were used in crime and it displays it in a form that it allows it to make the connections.",36,,
187,0.97,1525.957,1536.868,It's important to that this does not give us access to information we would not otherwise have access to.,36,,
188,0.97,1536.868,1542.54,Ibm's I2 Ibase does not reach out and grab information that we don't already have.,36,,
189,0.97,1542.54,1548.68,It goes through the information that we already have and make the connection that the detectives would take a great deal of time to do.,36,,
190,0.97,1548.68,1552.851,So this is an efficiency process more than anything else.,36,,
191,0.97,1552.851,1571.536,We use it to assist a criminal investigation and to try and connect the dots in cases that may be related which allowed a higher Culpablability factor.,36,,
192,0.97,1571.536,1582.948,I have an example of what the is Twoz I date base would look like.,36,,
193,0.97,1582.948,1588.053,Spencer was kind enough to scrub it up for us.,36,,
194,0.97,1588.053,1592.057,"Go ahead to the next slide, please.",36,,
195,0.97,1592.057,1599.397,"As I said before, this is pulling information from SPD's specific system.",36,,
196,0.97,1599.397,1631.863,"It does comb our records management system that we already have and our officers and detectives have access to and our Computer-Aided dispatch that handled all of the Deployments in the field and are already in patrol, and they reach in the Database for connections, but again, not reaching into databases we don't have access to.",36,,
197,0.97,1631.863,1644.075,And the data collection relates to agencies that have provided information related to their cases or an example where we get information off of bullets that were fired at different crime scenes.,36,,
198,0.97,1644.075,1657.956,When we get results of those and it mentions that they are connected to other crimes we can manually put the information into is I2 I base.,36,,
199,0.97,1657.956,1661.96,And shows us where it was used in more than one sense.,36,,
200,0.97,1661.96,1668.566,And it's limited to Password logging in credentials.,36,,
201,0.97,1668.566,1684.282,"Everyone using it is certified and has approved access to the information, and there is an audit log that shows the usage log that shows when a person is logged on and the data that is added to it.",36,,
202,0.97,1684.282,1702.267,And it's important to note that IBM I2 Ibase has information added to it.,36,,
203,0.97,1702.267,1702.767,"Spencer, anything else?",36,,
204,0.97,1702.901,1705.136,There is information that is put in every night.,37,,
205,0.97,1705.136,1707.839,At 3:00 A.M.,37,,
206,0.97,1707.839,1708.306,"There, is an update.",37,,
207,0.97,1708.306,1712.844,A portion of our data is pushed into the Ibase Database.,37,,
208,0.97,1712.844,1716.714,It doesn't reach out and grab anything.,37,,
209,0.97,1716.714,1724.222,Like you said it doesn't generate any linkages we don't already have in the system.,37,,
210,0.97,1724.222,1725.824,Thank you.,38,,
211,0.97,1725.824,1728.059,"Go ahead to the next slide, please.",38,,
212,0.97,1728.059,1734.666,"Once again, here are the policies that relate to the Ibase.",38,,
213,0.97,1734.666,1735.633,It's a subscription service.,38,,
214,0.97,1735.633,1739.27,I know there was a concern about the lack of a contract.,38,,
215,0.97,1739.27,1754.252,We will continue to look for--I will get any casework that we have related to the descriptions subscription with them.,38,,
216,0.97,1754.252,1756.454,"Go ahead to the next slide, please.",38,,
217,0.97,1756.454,1762.327,"And I'm open to any questions at this point, Councilmembers.",38,,
218,0.97,1762.327,1775.573,"Thank you very much for that presentation, and because you teased us with information about a visual representation of how Ibase works, can you show that, please?",39,,
219,0.97,1775.707,1792.056,I would be happy to with the moderator.,40,,
220,0.97,1792.056,1792.924,Just a moment.,40,,
221,0.97,1792.924,1798.596,"Hopefully, everyone is seeing the display, a simplified model of the display chart.",40,,
222,0.97,1798.596,1804.068,At the top we have a bun.,40,,
223,0.97,1804.068,1804.269,Gun.,40,,
224,0.97,1804.269,1811.176,This is a ballistics match of the gun that fired on the next level down.,40,,
225,0.97,1811.176,1812.577,This soldier are Spd-Native cases.,40,,
226,0.97,1812.577,1823.688,These are cases that are pulled in our Stats with information in those cases related to vehicles involved in those cases or persons involved in those cases.,40,,
227,0.97,1823.688,1828.059,You can see additional cases here that were pulled in by ballistic matches.,40,,
228,0.97,1828.059,1833.865,"You can see the King County sheriffs office, Renton PD.",40,,
229,0.97,1833.865,1841.306,These were matches that were returned to the case detectives as it relates to you ran this gun with this ballistics.,40,,
230,0.97,1841.306,1856.187,"It matched a report in this agency's ballistics, and we get the information and we are able to pull in additional information that helps us to lead to an identified suspect at the bottom.",40,,
231,0.97,1856.187,1868.633,This is an excellent example of how I2 Ibase allows us to display the information already in our reach and quickly reach to the point where we have an identified suspect that we can further investigate.,40,,
232,0.97,1868.633,1870.835,I think that's an important point.,40,,
233,0.97,1870.835,1874.639,"This is not going to make us go Okay, that's our guy.",40,,
234,0.97,1874.639,1878.343,Let's go get him.,40,,
235,0.97,1878.343,1880.078,"This simply leads the detectives to say, okay.",40,,
236,0.97,1880.078,1885.917,That's where I need to guide my investigation to see what is going on with that information and that person.,40,,
237,0.97,1885.917,1892.423,And we can reach out to the agencies involved here and validate information related to their cases.,40,,
238,0.97,1892.423,1895.894,All of that validation would have to be done by a detective.,40,,
239,0.97,1895.894,1908.706,This simply allows a detective to speed up the process of evaluating the information and try and get persons involved in gun crimes off the streets.,40,,
240,0.97,1908.706,1915.079,I would just NOTE this is something that we are and were able to do before we had Ibase.,41,,
241,0.97,1915.079,1928.66,It was much more time-consuming and much more error prone because we would have to physically type in all this information and we had people making mistakes.,41,,
242,0.97,1928.66,1929.394,"Thanks, Spencer.",42,,
243,0.97,1929.727,1932.063,Okay.,43,,
244,0.97,1932.063,1945.109,I have a couple questions that were prompted by the presentation but does anyone have a question about this particular slide or how Ibase works?,43,,
245,0.97,1945.243,1948.179,"I have one question, Madam chair.",44,,
246,0.97,1948.179,1949.58,"Yes, go ahead.",45,,
247,0.97,1949.58,1950.682,Thank you.,46,,
248,0.97,1950.682,1953.484,I wish this was bigger.,47,,
249,0.97,1953.484,1957.822,I apologize for moving my face way in to the laptop.,47,,
250,0.97,1957.822,1959.958,"Oh, thank you.",47,,
251,0.97,1959.958,1968.099,"All of the agencies that you are distributing information to like King County, you used as an example, and you have Kent and you have Renton.",47,,
252,0.97,1968.099,1970.268,Is this just an example?,47,,
253,0.97,1970.268,1974.572,Are you sending it out to--is it just within King County?,47,,
254,0.97,1974.706,1975.54,I can clarify that.,48,,
255,0.97,1975.54,1992.256,We are not sending this to these agencies this much is for our detective for his or her knowledge.,48,,
256,0.97,1992.256,2005.503,"This gun used in your Homicide was used in a Renton PD case, and you should reach out to the Renton PD detectives and coordinate with them.",48,,
257,0.97,2005.503,2008.172,"So you are not limited, then?",49,,
258,0.97,2008.172,2012.143,This is an example of one gun and how you got to the suspect.,49,,
259,0.97,2012.143,2012.41,Correct?,49,,
260,0.97,2012.543,2015.78,That's right.,50,,
261,0.97,2015.78,2019.183,But this is a real case.,50,,
262,0.97,2019.183,2020.118,We simply scrubbed it.,50,,
263,0.97,2020.118,2022.32,This was used in a 2017 shooting.,50,,
264,0.97,2022.32,2022.687,Right.,51,,
265,0.97,2022.687,2024.222,Got it.,51,,
266,0.97,2024.222,2028.059,I follow all that.,51,,
267,0.97,2028.059,2028.726,But you are sharing.,51,,
268,0.97,2028.726,2034.399,It doesn't necessarily limit itself to King County.,51,,
269,0.97,2034.399,2036.334,It tells the detective on the case?,51,,
270,0.97,2036.467,2036.701,Right.,52,,
271,0.97,2036.701,2057.755,"If there was a returned hit out of another agency, we would be able to manually add an agent, like a New York agency.",52,,
272,0.97,2057.755,2059.724,Anything that was manually added,52,,
273,0.97,2059.724,2060.057,Great.,53,,
274,0.97,2060.057,2068.065,I know we have a lot of issues with overlapping jurisdictions in police departments.,53,,
275,0.97,2068.065,2070.568,And I want to see how that worked.,53,,
276,0.97,2070.568,2076.507,I have a much better understanding now.,53,,
277,0.97,2076.507,2079.077,Thank you.,53,,
278,0.97,2079.077,2080.077,Thank you.,54,,
279,0.97,2080.077,2082.079,Councilmember Herbold?,55,,
280,0.97,2082.213,2084.048,Thank you very much.,56,,
281,0.97,2084.048,2088.052,I have a question about a previous slide.,56,,
282,0.97,2088.052,2089.12,Is this the time to ask it?,56,,
283,0.97,2089.253,2090.788,Yes.,57,,
284,0.97,2090.788,2095.726,I also have a question about the presentation as well.,57,,
285,0.97,2095.726,2095.993,Sure.,58,,
286,0.97,2095.993,2112.043,"Could you please go back to slide five of the presentation, the general Sir creation Timeline?",58,,
287,0.97,2112.043,2121.018,Let me back up.,59,,
288,0.97,2121.018,2121.319,All right.,59,,
289,0.97,2121.319,2123.221,Let's go back.,59,,
290,0.97,2123.554,2126.524,Okay.,60,,
291,0.97,2126.524,2133.698,Thank you; so this process says that it's eight to nine months.,60,,
292,0.97,2133.698,2136.567,But the ordinance was passed in 2017.,60,,
293,0.97,2136.567,2137.935,It's now 2022.,60,,
294,0.97,2137.935,2154.719,So what was--this technology was in in use in 2017.,60,,
295,0.97,2154.719,2160.791,What was--this seems like a long time to go through a review with the technology.,60,,
296,0.97,2160.791,2166.797,And what happens if another vendor or new technology comes on board?,60,,
297,0.97,2166.797,2172.403,Would you allow for the same--perform the same function?,60,,
298,0.97,2172.403,2175.273,My point is simply this is a long time.,60,,
299,0.97,2175.273,2188.052,Can you just explain a little bit about what happens if there are other options that are available in the intervening time frame?,60,,
300,0.97,2188.186,2190.555,Sure.,61,,
301,0.97,2190.555,2214.178,"I'll ask Sarahto assist if needed but the Timeline question to determine the number of Technologies that met the criteria, we worked with the Council at that time to propose a sequence path forward to do the retroactive analysis.",61,,
302,0.97,2214.178,2223.221,"Eight, nine months is average, and we don't have to go back and make a lot of changes or, you know, do additional research on the technology.",61,,
303,0.97,2223.221,2230.628,This technology was slated for the time period that we are in now.,61,,
304,0.97,2230.628,2238.669,"And that explains why it's taken, really, closer to five years and not or four years and not eight to nine months.",61,,
305,0.97,2238.669,2247.945,"When we started working on this or these particular technologies, the time period is closer to the Timeline that is listed.",61,,
306,0.97,2247.945,2266.564,"But there was an analysis and a conclusion drawn that we had to sequence the Technologies due to the research to do the work, and that's why we are looking at group four today and back in 2017.",61,,
307,0.97,2266.564,2267.965,And forgive me.,61,,
308,0.97,2267.965,2272.269,Your second question was what happened to the new technology that comes in place?,61,,
309,0.97,2272.269,2289.82,"Sarah, can you speak on how we are evaluating new requests and how we might have partly an example here that represents the technology that the Department decided to Decommission during the process?",61,,
310,0.97,2289.954,2292.056,Yeah.,62,,
311,0.97,2292.056,2312.076,"So the privacy team, the privacy program reviews technology acquisitions and makes an initial determination as to whether or not this technology, you know, meets the definition of surveillance or whether it doesn't.",62,,
312,0.97,2312.076,2320.017,"Every quarter, we provided the analysis by way of quarterly report.",62,,
313,0.97,2320.017,2328.959,"And you all know, obviously, reserve the right to make a determination out of that report, and that's how we evaluate new technologies as they come in.",62,,
314,0.97,2328.959,2340.071,"And, Yeah, to Jim's point, you know, because of the lengthy process there have been times when technology changes rapidly.",62,,
315,0.97,2340.071,2340.304,Right?,62,,
316,0.97,2340.304,2356.287,"And so there have been times where departments have chosen to, you know, move on to technology or a different way to accomplish the same business goal, you know, in the process, so.",62,,
317,0.97,2356.287,2359.356,If I could add on to that?,63,,
318,0.97,2359.356,2361.392,Yes.,64,,
319,0.97,2361.392,2363.16,"Go ahead, please.",64,,
320,0.97,2363.16,2400.464,"So if there is a new technology or a new way to do this, depending on whether it's a new version or a standard version of the Audio recording devices, they would need to update the Sir and the revised Sir would because the technology would come back to Council, and if it's a new technology with a different vendor and a different way of doing it, it would require a different Sir.",65,,
321,0.97,2400.464,2402.032,Thank you very much.,66,,
322,0.97,2402.032,2409.006,Is there anything for Captain Britt that anyone would like to add before we go on?,66,,
323,0.97,2409.006,2409.54,No.,66,,
324,0.97,2409.54,2412.076,Okay.,66,,
325,0.97,2412.076,2423.32,"So basically setting up processes and it takes a long time, and so that accounts partly for the length of time to get here.",66,,
326,0.97,2423.32,2424.422,"So moving on, Councilmember Herbold.",66,,
327,0.97,2424.422,2424.755,Thank you.,67,,
328,0.97,2424.755,2435.466,"It's a related question, and maybe you have answered it, but if you have, I need to hear it again.",67,,
329,0.97,2435.466,2454.118,"We have the Technologies that are in use that are--that we are hearing are retroactive approval of, and then we have the new technology or add capacities to the existing technology.",67,,
330,0.97,2454.118,2456.12,How do we Prioritize what we are acting on?,67,,
331,0.97,2456.12,2471.101,Are we just trying to just deal with the retroactive Technologies first or get to the capacities of the Already- approved Technologies?,67,,
332,0.97,2471.101,2478.242,Or are we considering this process for the new technologies as we go as well?,67,,
333,0.97,2478.375,2482.847,Who would like to take that?,68,,
334,0.97,2482.847,2501.198,"Sarah, can you address the issue of new technologies that have come up in the interim as well as instances where we determine that there has been a material change to Technologists and how often that has happened and come up?",69,,
335,0.97,2501.332,2502.132,Yeah.,70,,
336,0.97,2502.132,2502.533,So sure.,70,,
337,0.97,2502.533,2505.002,Things are kind of happening in parallels.,70,,
338,0.97,2505.002,2507.938,Right?,70,,
339,0.97,2507.938,2544.241,"We have been focused primarily on getting through the retroactive list in the process, the Technologies that we have determined are surveillance throughout 2017, and that has been the primary focus but we are still doing reviews, right N parallel of new technologies that we are aware of any material changes, we, you know, go through that process that Lisa mentioned about updating the Sir for Technologies that have already been approved to the Council.",70,,
340,0.97,2544.241,2548.345,So they're kind of happening in parallel.,70,,
341,0.97,2548.345,2556.053,Though the focus thus far has primarily been on getting through the retroactive stuff.,70,,
342,0.97,2556.053,2557.321,Thank you so much.,71,,
343,0.97,2557.321,2559.189,Yeah.,72,,
344,0.97,2559.189,2562.893,And that begs the question for Captain Britt.,73,,
345,0.97,2562.893,2573.537,"Have you bought any new technology, surveillance technology since--in this--since 2017 or since the process began?",73,,
346,0.97,2573.671,2574.738,"No, Ma'am.",74,,
347,0.97,2574.738,2607.605,"There were points where we have updated existing privacy impact reports and evaluated, for example, technology to use 3G Wireless had to be upgraded to use 5G Wireless, and working with folks at the Seattle light privacy office and ginger Armbruster and her team to update.",74,,
348,0.97,2607.605,2616.28,But since the ordinance passed we have not updated or made changes to our capabilities.,74,,
349,0.97,2616.28,2636.467,"And Councilmember Nelson, I will point out it's Seattle light's responsibility to conduct all technology acquisitions and partly in part because of processes like these, the theory review process and we make sure they are not redundant and not cause undo support burdens for the city.",75,,
350,0.97,2636.467,2640.337,There are a number of checks and balances that we have in place.,75,,
351,0.97,2640.337,2667.464,All of the technology purposes to get a surveillance review either to determine if they are likely to be a surveillance technology or not and then the determinations there all get through Council annually so you all have the opportunity to look at the ones that were not surveillance and have the ability to ask questions or further review.,75,,
352,0.97,2667.464,2670.734,"And that's--thank you, sir.",76,,
353,0.97,2670.734,2685.783,"We have purchased technology, but every technology we purchase has gone through the privacy Accessment to determine it's worthy to have a tag of surveillance technology.",76,,
354,0.97,2685.783,2692.022,"Since the passage of this ordinance, we have not purchased any new surveillance technology.",76,,
355,0.97,2692.022,2715.112,"Correct, and with SPD and other departments we engage in a process to determine if there are other ways to solve the problems that they want to solve or byproducts to have conduct surveillance operations or surveillance and Surveillance-Like operations and other departments, not just SPD.",77,,
356,0.97,2715.112,2730.627,"The ordinance applies to all city departments, and we do that review for all city departments and have had many instance where is we talked the Department out of acquiring something because we determined that you can do what you want to do without being sneaky about it.",77,,
357,0.97,2730.627,2750.247,"We were talking about technology that--for example, city light or, I don't know, parks, even laptops or Ipads or things like that, I mean, that is why there is so much material to go through.",78,,
358,0.97,2750.247,2750.714,Am I correct?,78,,
359,0.97,2750.848,2752.916,Yeah.,79,,
360,0.97,2752.916,2768.065,"For example, exactly, there are Technologists like Ipads and phones and laptops and we don't do a review for every instance of that technology but, Yeah.",79,,
361,0.97,2768.065,2776.073,"If someone wants to buy a Non- standard printer, you know, we ask the same basic questions of that as anything.",79,,
362,0.97,2776.073,2778.509,Are you collecting public data?,79,,
363,0.97,2778.509,2782.813,There are four or five basic questions we will ask if we do a further review.,79,,
364,0.97,2782.813,2786.483,We ask that of all Non-Standard purchases.,79,,
365,0.97,2786.483,2797.294,"For anything that is standard, something you can just buy, we have done the review on the Technologies that constitute that standard.",79,,
366,0.97,2797.294,2840.27,"So we are not reviewing every laptop or phone purchase but if you want to buy something new whether it's a data set that was accumulated in somewhere else or my Go-To example is a Picture-Take robot that Roams around downtown, we will put that through a security--I'm sorry, a surveillance review and, you know, there have been instances where the departments have realized yes, we agree that surveillance technology and the problem we are trying to solve or the results we are trying to achieve don't really merit the level of risk that this introduces to our public.",79,,
367,0.97,2840.27,2845.075,So we are not going to go forward with that purchase.,79,,
368,0.97,2845.075,2846.977,Understood.,80,,
369,0.97,2846.977,2847.711,Thank you.,80,,
370,0.97,2847.711,2847.911,Okay.,80,,
371,0.97,2847.911,2860.424,"Unless there are other questions about this presentation, could you take it down and then proceed.",80,,
372,0.97,2860.424,2862.659,"If there are questions, please voice them.",80,,
373,0.97,2862.659,2864.061,All right.,80,,
374,0.97,2864.061,2864.428,Thank you.,80,,
375,0.97,2864.561,2867.831,"Thank you, chair Nelson.",81,,
376,0.97,2867.831,2872.035,"And I will put my presentation up on the screen, and I am grateful for this offer.",81,,
377,0.97,2872.035,2874.805,Thank you very much.,81,,
378,0.97,2874.805,2876.073,"And good morning, Councilmembers.",81,,
379,0.97,2876.073,2880.31,I haven't seen most of you in person yet.,81,,
380,0.97,2880.31,2884.481,But that will change at support.,81,,
381,0.97,2884.481,2893.79,So I'm going to move pretty quickly through the first few slides so as not to repeat the information that you have already heard.,81,,
382,0.97,2893.79,2912.075,My presentation will cover a little bit about them and focus omit Tkpwaeugz and civil liberties and impact and policy considerations.,81,,
383,0.97,2912.075,2920.284,My policy considerations will focus on several liberties's impact.,81,,
384,0.97,2920.284,2952.582,"As chair Nelson pointed out, if you would like additional background all of this information you can look at the reference in staff memos that we will talk about with the working group and civil liberties assessment and whether it's regulated by Federal or state or city law and if it's impacted by SPD such as assisted policing.",81,,
385,0.97,2952.582,2956.153,So I'll--you'll--yes?,81,,
386,0.97,2956.286,2958.755,I didn't mean to interrupt.,82,,
387,0.97,2958.755,2968.131,"Your voice is a little bit fuzzy or low when you talk, so.",82,,
388,0.97,2968.131,2969.433,You can proceed.,82,,
389,0.97,2969.433,2970.534,Let me see if can I --,83,,
390,0.97,2970.534,2971.468,That is better.,84,,
391,0.97,2971.468,2972.069,Go ahead.,84,,
392,0.97,2972.069,2980.077,I'm sorry.,85,,
393,0.97,2980.077,2981.878,Okay.,85,,
394,0.97,2981.878,2982.546,Thank you.,85,,
395,0.97,2982.546,2986.983,"So if we can have the next slide, Jim, please.",85,,
396,0.97,2986.983,2988.552,So this is the first of two hearings.,85,,
397,0.97,2988.552,2992.189,The second hearing will be on May 11 with a possible vote.,85,,
398,0.97,2992.189,2999.996,"I would NOTE if you have any amendments in mind, please get those to me my may 2.",85,,
399,0.97,2999.996,3012.075,That would give me enough sometime to draft them and obtain a legal review to meet the deadline for the May 11th meeting.,85,,
400,0.97,3012.075,3018.749,"The next slide, please.",85,,
401,0.97,3018.749,3036.8,"So in addition to being subject to the city's surveillance, the Department's operations are governed by section 1412 of the municipal code which defines the criminal intelligence powers and functions, including how the Department can select and record and retain and share information.",85,,
402,0.97,3036.8,3052.649,"So if you want information, more background on the surveillance ordinances or intelligence ordinances I would point you to the background memo that chair Nelson pointed out.",85,,
403,0.97,3052.649,3054.384,"Next slide, please.",85,,
404,0.97,3054.384,3056.853,I'm going to skip over this one.,85,,
405,0.97,3056.853,3064.061,This is an abbreviated of the chart that Cto Loder showed you.,85,,
406,0.97,3064.061,3082.679,So this is Council bill 12307 and Retro actively approve the Audio recording systems and accept the Sir and overview.,85,,
407,0.97,3082.679,3084.214,You pretty much heard the description of this.,85,,
408,0.97,3084.214,3088.051,I am going to skip over this.,85,,
409,0.97,3088.051,3090.587,"The next slide, then.",85,,
410,0.97,3090.587,3108.071,So each Sir has to include an Adaptive version of a racial equity Toolkit and identify mitigation of the proportion of impact on individuals of vulnerable communities.,85,,
411,0.97,3108.071,3124.054,This identifies several risks to privacy including the risk of private information on suspects and be acquired and the risk that date storing can contribute to structural racism.,85,,
412,0.97,3124.054,3132.295,The police Department mitigates the impacts to the evidence procedures and Anti-Bias policies and warrant requirements.,85,,
413,0.97,3132.295,3134.297,"The next slide, please.",85,,
414,0.97,3134.297,3140.303,So for Audio recording systems you will see three policy considerations in the staff report.,85,,
415,0.97,3140.303,3144.508,The first one is the equity assessment Metrics.,85,,
416,0.97,3144.508,3168.598,"For those of you who have been through this with the previous committee that looked at the Sirs, this is up to the Department to use with the Cto, the net weighs to measure the Disproportional impacts.",85,,
417,0.97,3168.598,3172.068,Man of the previous Sirs have included any of these Metrics.,85,,
418,0.97,3172.068,3180.143,I think there was an assumption of a process that didn't happen.,85,,
419,0.97,3180.143,3188.552,"So when previous committees have done have asked, requested by amendment that they provide a report on proposed Metrics by a specific date.",85,,
420,0.97,3188.552,3211.308,The next item I noted as a policy consideration is the mitigation of civil liberties impacts and provide sufficient litigation but I find that it's not really possible to fully evaluate if the cities are used equitably without historical data.,85,,
421,0.97,3211.308,3227.424,"You will see in the staff memo, an option would be ask to the SPD report on how the Audio recording systems were deployed and how the incident would tie the location and identify disproportionate impacts.",85,,
422,0.97,3227.424,3232.329,This recommendation is consistent with some of the recommendations from the working groups.,85,,
423,0.97,3232.329,3244.407,The next one also is consistent with the working group's recommendation which is authentication of the recordings.,85,,
424,0.97,3244.407,3249.246,So the Sir is silent in this matter.,85,,
425,0.97,3249.246,3270.967,I basically found that inaccurate identification in speakers could lead to mistakes in criminal investigations and I found that accidental or intentional tampering could be rendered Inadmissible in court.,85,,
426,0.97,3270.967,3279.743,So it's important to tape the people you say you are Taping so there are no missing gaps that would be viable evidence in a court hearing.,85,,
427,0.97,3279.743,3292.622,So Council has an option to ask that the police Department develop policy and procedures to more formally verify the authenticity of the Audio recording.,85,,
428,0.97,3292.622,3301.164,"I will move on to the Ibase software, please.",85,,
429,0.97,3301.164,3305.268,You are so good at this.,85,,
430,0.97,3305.268,3306.569,Okay.,85,,
431,0.97,3306.569,3312.075,I am not going to go over too much more description of what the software does.,85,,
432,0.97,3312.075,3315.078,I think captain Britt did a wonderful job of this.,85,,
433,0.97,3315.078,3322.252,So let's go ahead and talk about the next slide which is the civil liberties impacts.,85,,
434,0.97,3322.252,3346.943,"So in this Sir, SPD noted that the most important of intended convince in Ibase is the tool to identify relationships.",85,,
435,0.97,3346.943,3348.445,There are two detectives that use this.,85,,
436,0.97,3348.445,3352.882,"So instead of 10 detectives, your magnitude of error goes down.",85,,
437,0.97,3352.882,3372.602,"They also identified some other potential risks in terms of acquiring private information about suspects and victims, potential ethnic weighs or bias built into the algorithm and the data sharing and retention to contribute to and maintain racism.",85,,
438,0.97,3372.602,3386.75,Spd said that these set of risks are mitigated by evidence procedures and Anti-Bias policies and warrant requirements.,85,,
439,0.97,3386.75,3388.184,Let's talk about the policies.,85,,
440,0.97,3388.184,3393.79,You can see the equity assessment Metrics need to be provided.,85,,
441,0.97,3393.79,3402.565,And Sir left blank a question that was how SPD would respond to public comments.,85,,
442,0.97,3402.565,3414.244,"So, obviously, going forward if Council chooses to, you could ask a report to provide those sets of mitigation.",85,,
443,0.97,3414.244,3428.057,"The mitigation of civil liberty impacts is a significant policy considering, the risk of wrongly identifying individuals that has significant potential consequences and could have tragic out comes.",85,,
444,0.97,3428.057,3434.063,"So, again, in the absence of historical data we don't know how often this takes place.",85,,
445,0.97,3434.063,3437.667,"We don't have an error rate, for example.",85,,
446,0.97,3437.667,3462.625,And so one way that the Council could move forward on this is to obtain an independent evaluation as to the risks from SPD's current practices and that could help set the stage to know whether SPD could benefit from additional policies and protocols to protect against the errors and potential bias and data.,85,,
447,0.97,3462.625,3498.561,"So that kind of an evaluation could look at the number of the areas that being of concern by this surveillance working group, the for examples including the documentation of the number of incidents in which SPD uses the system and databases used by SPD, and the types of date historically input by officers, and the inaccuracy of the analysis and demographic information about individuals and groups that are associated with the analysis.",85,,
448,0.97,3498.561,3504.267,"A red flag, independent evaluation such as this would probably require additional resources.",85,,
449,0.97,3504.267,3511.708,That might be something that Council may want to consider in an upcoming governmental budget.,85,,
450,0.97,3511.708,3520.049,"So I'll quickly go over the last, and that will complete my presentation.",85,,
451,0.97,3520.049,3522.652,"The contractual terms, Captain Britt noted --",85,,
452,0.97,3522.652,3522.986,I'm sorry.,86,,
453,0.97,3522.986,3528.691,"I asked if you wanted to take questions, but you made a point of extra resources.",86,,
454,0.97,3528.691,3540.336,"So the public comments that were described in the previous presentation, those public comments sort of feed into the working group work.",86,,
455,0.97,3540.336,3544.474,"I mean, they consider public comments before they begin their work.",86,,
456,0.97,3544.474,3544.974,Am I correct?,86,,
457,0.97,3545.108,3547.51,Yes.,87,,
458,0.97,3547.51,3550.48,They generally monitor the public comment process.,87,,
459,0.97,3550.48,3551.514,Okay.,88,,
460,0.97,3551.514,3552.048,Thanks so much.,88,,
461,0.97,3552.048,3554.317,Sure.,89,,
462,0.97,3554.317,3570.567,"For the contractual terms, the city has actually attempted the Sir provided that would provide terms and conditions that would protect the city's data and privacy and set privacy standards.",89,,
463,0.97,3570.567,3577.106,So any sort of vendor providing a license to meet agreements probably doesn't do that.,89,,
464,0.97,3577.106,3596.059,"I know that there were concerns in the past about Pre- technology, not the case with this, but that by using a city contract, you are able to protect the data, the city's data better than if you rely on a vendor for the documents.",89,,
465,0.97,3596.059,3608.237,And one option is to ask SPD to go ahead and develop a contract using the city vendors.,89,,
466,0.97,3608.237,3615.945,"The retention schedule here, SPD uses the maximum retention period allowed recommended by Federal and state laws other than the minimum.",89,,
467,0.97,3615.945,3620.049,So you can use records for five years.,89,,
468,0.97,3620.049,3630.593,"If you retain, this could result in a lot of Out-Of-Date records on here and not accurate and there is no way to validate the information each year.",89,,
469,0.97,3630.593,3654.55,One way to go forward with this if you choose would be to ask SPD to develop and revise retain policies and perhaps have the validation change of one year.,89,,
470,0.97,3654.55,3676.072,"And finally, the SPD Computer- aided dispatch is operated by the new community safety and communications center which is actually a Separat Department by the SPD, and both departments are under the Federal rules sharing but it would provide a greater transparency of data share.",89,,
471,0.97,3676.072,3693.189,And you could ask SPD to develop a more formal MLA or Mou with the community safety and communications center as to how data will be shared and protected.,89,,
472,0.97,3693.189,3693.723,That COMPLETES my report.,89,,
473,0.97,3693.723,3694.624,Thank you very much.,90,,
474,0.97,3694.624,3704.634,And I will now open the conversation to questions from my colleagues.,90,,
475,0.97,3704.634,3705.301,Councilmember Herbold.,90,,
476,0.97,3705.301,3708.071,You can remove the presentation.,90,,
477,0.97,3708.071,3708.571,No.,90,,
478,0.97,3708.571,3710.106,Don't remove it.,90,,
479,0.97,3710.106,3711.04,There might be questions.,90,,
480,0.97,3711.04,3712.041,Thank you so much.,90,,
481,0.97,3712.041,3712.375,Thank you.,91,,
482,0.97,3712.375,3737.934,"And on slide five, I know one of the recommendations in the working group was that SPD disclose the names of manufacturers, model names and model numbers of the recording systems and the response from SPD is they want to avoid the risk of counter measures as it relates to the Audio recording systems.",91,,
483,0.97,3737.934,3740.403,Can you explain a little bit about what that means?,91,,
484,0.97,3740.536,3746.976,I am going to direct that to the police Department for that.,92,,
485,0.97,3746.976,3748.077,Yes.,93,,
486,0.97,3748.211,3749.412,Captain Britt here.,94,,
487,0.97,3749.412,3750.58,Yeah.,94,,
488,0.97,3750.58,3766.028,"If we are required to disclose information about these devices, exactly what they are, make, model, people are able to gather information about them and develop ways to defeat or prevent us from using these items effectively.",94,,
489,0.97,3766.028,3768.064,Thank you.,95,,
490,0.97,3768.064,3775.338,A couple of other questions if I play?,95,,
491,0.97,3775.338,3842.471,"As it relate specifically to the recommendation that there be a specific prohibition on the use of Biometric technology on or with Audio recordings, appreciate that SPD explained that they do not use Biometric technology in conjunction with the recording system but wouldn't it still be an action for the Council that we could take to specify in a way with the working group recommendation that they use the Tech into we state Proactively that we don't support that or would that be inconsistent with the approach that we use for the surveillance Technologies which is basically it is prohibited until we say it's not.",95,,
492,0.97,3842.471,3848.177,"Councilmember, I think you are right.",96,,
493,0.97,3848.177,3852.048,"Sometimes, that's an important policy decision that you could make, that the Council could make.",96,,
494,0.97,3852.048,3853.349,And you are right.,96,,
495,0.97,3853.349,3867.33,"If they chose to use the Biometric technology, they would need to submit an environmental impact report.",96,,
496,0.97,3867.33,3874.503,I believe we did a that on facial recognition?,97,,
497,0.97,3874.503,3874.737,Yes.,98,,
498,0.97,3874.737,3887.65,"Would that be an amendments to this particular piece of legislation, or would that be a separate policy process?",99,,
499,0.97,3887.65,3906.002,It would depend on whether you wanted to limit the prohibition the technology to associated Audio recording systems or the use any of Biometric technology.,100,,
500,0.97,3906.002,3906.335,All right.,101,,
501,0.97,3906.335,3908.537,"Councilmember Herbold, do you have other questions?",101,,
502,0.97,3908.537,3909.005,I do.,102,,
503,0.97,3909.005,3916.078,But I am going to just pause for a moment just to see if there are questions about this technology.,102,,
504,0.97,3916.078,3921.25,My other questions are related to the other.,102,,
505,0.97,3921.384,3927.29,Could you go back to the mitigating of civil liberties?,103,,
506,0.97,3927.29,3936.232,And this applies to both of the Council bills because that is mentioned in there.,103,,
507,0.97,3936.232,3948.911,"So are these--when we talk about several liberties, these are all Technologies that have already been--these investigations--you are using these because there has been a warrant?",103,,
508,0.97,3948.911,3955.551,"I mean, can you--that's a broad term, mitigating civil liberties.",103,,
509,0.97,3955.551,3971.133,So what does the warrant process provide for any kind of mitigation of violations of civil liberties and is the privacy ordinance that also governs the use of some of the Technologies?,103,,
510,0.97,3971.133,3972.201,"That is for SPD, I think.",103,,
511,0.97,3972.201,3972.568,Yes.,104,,
512,0.97,3972.568,3975.237,Certainly.,105,,
513,0.97,3975.237,3984.981,"The warrant process, the detective when sitting before the judge has to show why they believe this person has relevant information and why we should be allowed to record the way we're recording.",105,,
514,0.97,3984.981,3994.724,"And then the judge gets to determine whether we are allowed to create a recording without the person's knowledge, where and when we are allowed to do that.",105,,
515,0.97,3994.724,3996.058,They can say within 30 days.,105,,
516,0.97,3996.058,3999.328,You have to serve this warrant within 30 days.,105,,
517,0.97,3999.328,4003.032,They can say you can't do it in privately controlled areas.,105,,
518,0.97,4003.032,4004.066,You have to do it in public.,105,,
519,0.97,4004.066,4014.977,They can say you have to do it when the person is alone or with a certain number of people around or less than a certain number of people around.,105,,
520,0.97,4014.977,4024.053,The judges have leeway to control the process.,105,,
521,0.97,4024.053,4031.36,We going to the judge and the judge determines the limits we have in the recording.,105,,
522,0.97,4031.36,4032.161,Thank you.,106,,
523,0.97,4032.161,4037.933,"Councilmember Herbold, are you ready for another question or any other of my other colleagues, please?",107,,
524,0.97,4037.933,4038.567,Sure.,108,,
525,0.97,4038.567,4044.073,Happy to jump in here on the next technology.,108,,
526,0.97,4044.073,4056.118,"Just wondering as it relates to slide 11, I think maybe we've recovered it.",108,,
527,0.97,4056.118,4060.056,The Ibase combines data from other sources at SPD?,108,,
528,0.97,4060.056,4082.077,"And it looks like the Ibase retains the compilation of the data and it is pulled from for the maximum of five years, and I'm wondering is there a minimum?",108,,
529,0.97,4082.077,4092.788,"Lisa, you suggested there may be an interest in asking for a retention schedule that is different than the maximum?",108,,
530,0.97,4092.788,4097.827,I believe that we have done that with other Technologies as well.,108,,
531,0.97,4097.827,4110.606,There is a state retention central schedule and the length of time or maximum--I'm sorry.,109,,
532,0.97,4110.606,4117.079,The minimum retention bases on the case but I will also turn that over to SPD if you want to add to that statement.,109,,
533,0.97,4117.079,4124.053,"For example, murder cases, the records have to be held much longer than Shoplifting cases.",109,,
534,0.97,4124.053,4128.057,It depends on the nature of the records.,109,,
535,0.97,4128.057,4146.876,"At the risk of speaking outside of my Lane, I would refer to the SPD legal Department to make sure we have it correct case by case but yes, the retention is set by the nature of the crime and state law.",110,,
536,0.97,4146.876,4153.048,"Rebecca, do you want to add on anything here?",111,,
537,0.97,4153.048,4155.651,Captain Britt is correct.,112,,
538,0.97,4155.651,4162.892,It's on a case by case basis and established by the state retention deadline.,112,,
539,0.97,4162.892,4176.438,"We don't have anyone in the Prosecutor's office here but it seems to me, not knowing how long it takes the case to go through, what if there is an allegation that you got the wrong guy, for example?",113,,
540,0.97,4176.438,4185.08,"I mean, and so the idea is that you want the records available for possible appeals?",113,,
541,0.97,4185.214,4191.72,That's the nature of why it's a case by case.,114,,
542,0.97,4191.72,4207.203,"We are required, for example in a Homicide case, required by law to obtain all evidence related to the case including all investigative files related to the case until all the appeals processes are concluded.",114,,
543,0.97,4207.203,4224.053,"They have to be held for a lengthy period of time but related to this, any information related to this would need to be held associated with the investigative file for the length of retention and you are correct, Councilmember, for the need for appeal.",114,,
544,0.97,4224.053,4234.563,"And just to clarify, the data in Ibase is not the actual data going into the investigation.",115,,
545,0.97,4234.563,4257.953,Any link created would be given to the detective and it would be his or her responsibility to hold on to that through the nature of the case and Ibase would be deleted after five years.,115,,
546,0.97,4257.953,4266.929,"Colleagues, do we have any other questions or comments about either the Technologies or the policy considerations before us?",116,,
547,0.97,4266.929,4276.071,Because we are not going to have the experts in the rooms to ask the questions unless we decide that we need that later?,116,,
548,0.97,4276.071,4289.785,But now is the time to ask detailed questions on these Technologies.,116,,
549,0.97,4289.785,4289.985,Okay.,116,,
550,0.97,4289.985,4290.552,Brian Maxey?,116,,
551,0.97,4290.686,4292.054,Good morning.,117,,
552,0.97,4292.054,4296.992,I want to clarify a couple of things that I authorized make sure that the committee has a full understanding.,117,,
553,0.97,4296.992,4306.635,"First of all, in terms of the contract, those are generally under I.T.",117,,
554,0.97,4306.635,4308.203,Control.,117,,
555,0.97,4308.203,4309.938,They are drafted by Seattle I.T.,117,,
556,0.97,4309.938,4320.983,"And they are looking at the use of the data in the system and whether the vendor has access to it, and that's part of their privacy and date control analysis.",117,,
557,0.97,4320.983,4328.424,That is not controlled by SPD as I understand it.,117,,
558,0.97,4328.424,4340.202,"And Secondly, the slide that the screen scared with the CSC, the community safety communications center, SPD controls the dispatch system.",117,,
559,0.97,4340.202,4350.479,"That is used by the Cscc, but we are the ones with the data management responsibilities and control over that system.",117,,
560,0.97,4350.479,4357.186,"So we do not have--the date sharing goes from us to them, not the other direction.",117,,
561,0.97,4357.186,4363.392,"Could I ask, is there a written agreement with the operation and control of SPD?",118,,
562,0.97,4363.525,4368.23,It has never changed during the De-Coupling.,119,,
563,0.97,4368.23,4376.438,"Right now, SPD is maintaining the operational, all the administrative systems for Cscc.",119,,
564,0.97,4376.438,4386.749,So I don't think there is a--there would be an agreement to transfer the control to Cscc rather than an agreement to leave it with SPD.,119,,
565,0.97,4386.749,4395.19,"To my knowledge, that document does not exist.",119,,
566,0.97,4395.19,4395.724,Thank you.,120,,
567,0.97,4395.858,4396.091,Okay.,121,,
568,0.97,4396.091,4408.737,Are there any other comments from anyone even my colleagues or the departmental staff that are with us today?,121,,
569,0.97,4408.737,4410.572,Okay.,121,,
570,0.97,4410.572,4413.275,"Lisa, do you have any follow up?",121,,
571,0.97,4413.408,4416.612,"Just wanted to remind people if you have amendments, please get those to me.",122,,
572,0.97,4416.612,4432.427,"They don't have to be fully baked, but please get them to me my May 7 and I will work with you on those to get them there in time for the May 11 meeting.",122,,
573,0.97,4432.427,4433.162,Captain Britt?,123,,
574,0.97,4433.295,4434.163,"Yes, Ma'am.",124,,
575,0.97,4434.163,4439.301,Spencer wanted to make a couple of clarifying comments.,124,,
576,0.97,4439.301,4451.914,"I am Spencer Hayne, a violent crime analyst, and I wanted to say the people with access to the Ibase is me and another civilian.",125,,
577,0.97,4451.914,4456.351,"We are civilians, not detectives.",125,,
578,0.97,4456.351,4464.593,"I looked through the agenda, and I fully appreciate and understand the concerns that were raised.",125,,
579,0.97,4464.593,4467.462,We have no desire to do anything untoward.,125,,
580,0.97,4467.462,4477.806,We don't have time to be wasting on contributing to any misappropriation of Attribution of data.,125,,
581,0.97,4477.806,4479.208,So I appreciate those concerns.,125,,
582,0.97,4479.208,4487.783,I think many of those concerns have been driven by a misunderstanding of what exactly Ibase is and what it does.,125,,
583,0.97,4487.783,4489.117,It's not smart.,125,,
584,0.97,4489.117,4491.753,There is no algorithm.,125,,
585,0.97,4491.753,4494.857,It doesn't make any sort of analysis.,125,,
586,0.97,4494.857,4499.761,Any analysis using Ibase is done by us using analysis.,125,,
587,0.97,4499.761,4515.944,"And it sounds like concerns, including the public comments were driven by the sales pitch information that was provided by IBM on their Website which is at best an exaggeration of what Ibase can do.",125,,
588,0.97,4515.944,4522.251,"For example, there was concern raised overheat maps.",125,,
589,0.97,4522.251,4524.019,The maps don't work.,125,,
590,0.97,4524.019,4526.822,We don't use them for mapping at all.,125,,
591,0.97,4526.822,4530.659,It was the way that it came out.,125,,
592,0.97,4530.659,4534.563,We don't even use the maps at all.,125,,
593,0.97,4534.563,4536.298,Another concern over the social network analysis.,125,,
594,0.97,4536.298,4545.24,The way that we bring the data in we can't use it for social network analysis it.,125,,
595,0.97,4545.24,4550.712,"Requires a linkage between two people, people who know each other and analyze the network.",125,,
596,0.97,4550.712,4554.616,That is not how we bring in the information.,125,,
597,0.97,4554.616,4556.752,We bring off the records management data system.,125,,
598,0.97,4556.752,4560.689,So a person is arrested in an incident.,125,,
599,0.97,4560.689,4574.903,"If another person is arrested in the incident as well, they are linked but you cannot run the SNA on that, so it doesn't work, and in addition, it has been stated that we have no relationship with IBM anymore.",125,,
600,0.97,4574.903,4575.27,I.T.,125,,
601,0.97,4575.27,4579.074,"Has the contract with them, and they have no access to our data whatever.",125,,
602,0.97,4579.074,4590.919,And would say that no police action is taken off information generated.,125,,
603,0.97,4590.919,4601.897,"And while we technically are in our Realtime crime center, it's down to one detective and the two analysts.",125,,
604,0.97,4601.897,4607.169,We rarely are paying attention to the Realtime stuff that is happening in the city.,125,,
605,0.97,4607.169,4608.904,We just don't have time for that.,125,,
606,0.97,4608.904,4614.876,"We are focused on larger Homicide and shooting investigations, and that sort of thing.",125,,
607,0.97,4614.876,4620.315,It's really not used to drive any sort of daily activities by officers.,125,,
608,0.97,4620.315,4621.483,Yeah.,125,,
609,0.97,4621.483,4626.888,I wish we had been engaged in this process more directly early on.,125,,
610,0.97,4626.888,4635.063,"We were not approached by the working group, but I could have provided some clarity on exactly how we use it.",125,,
611,0.97,4635.063,4642.404,"We provided the team the manual information that we do put in there, and it sounds like it did not make it to the working group.",125,,
612,0.97,4642.404,4643.405,We have nothing to hide.,125,,
613,0.97,4643.405,4648.276,"I welcome any oversight, anyone that would like to see exactly how we are doing it.",125,,
614,0.97,4648.276,4657.686,I wish I could give a demonstration here but it's pretty restricted in who is actually able to see the data.,125,,
615,0.97,4657.686,4665.861,"Beyond that, we have nothing to hide and I look forward to further engagement with anyone who wants to talk about what we are doing.",125,,
616,0.97,4665.861,4666.795,Thank you.,126,,
617,0.97,4666.795,4676.405,"When you were talking about maybe some of the concerns were based on Messaging, on the packaging, it raised a question for me.",126,,
618,0.97,4676.405,4680.242,"Can work group members call you up and say, Hey, what about this?",126,,
619,0.97,4680.242,4684.079,It seems like you are saying that didn't happen.,126,,
620,0.97,4684.079,4689.151,But is there a relationship so that you can answer some of these questions earlier on?,126,,
621,0.97,4689.284,4691.92,Absolutely.,127,,
622,0.97,4691.92,4698.76,"I mean, we would be happy to answer any question or concerns that anyone has directly.",127,,
623,0.97,4698.76,4704.499,Miss Kaye has been good about forwarding the questions over from the working group and we are doing our best to answer them.,128,,
624,0.97,4704.499,4719.681,I think a lot of times there is a telephone game going on there and at some point in the future as we engage in the process it may be good to get everyone in Theroom and run a demonstration to see it.,128,,
625,0.97,4719.681,4738.4,"And we pointed out how long this process has taken, beyond the eight or nine times and we would like to get everyone in the same room after Covid.",129,,
626,0.97,4738.4,4743.905,Which is apparently end game.,130,,
627,0.97,4743.905,4752.08,I am not so sure about that.,131,,
628,0.97,4752.08,4755.517,Go ahead.,132,,
629,0.97,4755.517,4772.434,"We have seven more Technologies coming from SPD this fall, and I urge them to connect the detectives early to the working groups in the process so they can focus their questions once they have received full information.",133,,
630,0.97,4772.434,4772.968,Councilmember Herbold?,134,,
631,0.97,4772.968,4776.104,Thank you.,135,,
632,0.97,4776.104,4798.66,"On that point, is there--is the issue a scheduling and logistics issue or the issue that there is no touch point built into the process that Seattle I.T.",135,,
633,0.97,4798.66,4814.042,Facilities not just with SPD but any Department with staff with expertise--operations expertise around the Technologies that they are brought in to present to the working group?,135,,
634,0.97,4814.042,4816.244,Does that step exist in the process?,135,,
635,0.97,4816.244,4820.215,Or does it not exist?,135,,
636,0.97,4820.215,4822.35,It does not --,136,,
637,0.97,4822.35,4822.617,Yeah.,137,,
638,0.97,4822.617,4824.519,I'm sorry.,137,,
639,0.97,4824.519,4825.387,Mean to interrupt.,137,,
640,0.97,4825.387,4825.62,No.,138,,
641,0.97,4825.62,4828.323,You should be answering at this point.,138,,
642,0.97,4828.323,4830.759,It does exist.,139,,
643,0.97,4830.759,4836.565,The subject matter experts from the Department are invited to the public engagement sessions.,139,,
644,0.97,4836.565,4844.105,"Sarah, do you happen to remember, was it this technology in particular regarding the working group?",139,,
645,0.97,4844.105,4852.08,Were there opportunities for the subject matter experts to meet directly with the working group?,139,,
646,0.97,4852.08,4854.816,On this technology and also in general?,139,,
647,0.97,4854.95,4856.084,Yeah.,140,,
648,0.97,4856.084,4887.449,"So typically when we open a public engagement window, public comment period we do inform the working group that we are opening the window, encourage them to not only attend meetings which are in our virtual world but also to try and help encourage and drive the connections with folks they 99 their community as well.",140,,
649,0.97,4887.449,4908.803,There is no direct presentation to the working group from the subject matter expert but they are encouraged and invited and informed that there will be engagement with the Department with the technology under review through the public comment window.,140,,
650,0.97,4908.803,4924.085,So the short answer is the opportunity exists through the members of the working group and the public to receive the information directly from and engage with the subject matter experts to engage.,141,,
651,0.97,4924.085,4938.9,Why would there not be an actual presentation from the Department seeking to purchase the technology or the retroactive use of the technology?,142,,
652,0.97,4938.9,4941.036,Why would that not be a component?,142,,
653,0.97,4941.169,4944.372,A presentation through the working group directly?,143,,
654,0.97,4944.372,4944.639,Yeah.,144,,
655,0.97,4944.639,4948.143,"Sarah, is that part of the process?",145,,
656,0.97,4948.143,4950.879,Is that an option apart of the process?,145,,
657,0.97,4951.012,4960.355,"That is not an ordinance defined process, so it has not been requested or part of--call it the public engagement process.",146,,
658,0.97,4960.355,4964.492,It was not a function that I have heard be requested about.,146,,
659,0.97,4964.492,4968.963,So it hasn't been part of the steps.,146,,
660,0.97,4968.963,4969.931,Okay.,147,,
661,0.97,4969.931,4972.1,Thank you.,147,,
662,0.97,4972.1,4980.475,Or in this case I am hearing that SPD was invited to a presentation.,148,,
663,0.97,4980.475,5012.44,"So I don't think every nuance of public engagement processes needs to be codified in Ordinancing, and we might decide collectively that it's a good idea to do so this subject matter expertise isn't just held by city staff working in the departments seeking the technology but that is shared with members of the public to have responsibility of Commenting on the technology.",148,,
664,0.97,5012.44,5015.643,You're right.,149,,
665,0.97,5015.643,5019.047,"And I heard that interest from you, Councilmember, as well as SPD.",149,,
666,0.97,5019.047,5035.597,"I think as we structure and evolve the working group process through this journey, you know, we can take those into consideration and get in information out for consumption by the resemble and representatives.",149,,
667,0.97,5035.597,5035.93,Thank you.,150,,
668,0.97,5035.93,5036.297,Thank you.,151,,
669,0.97,5036.297,5039.167,You have your hand up?,152,,
670,0.97,5039.167,5042.504,"I won't Belabor this, but absolutely we will welcome the opportunity to do so.",153,,
671,0.97,5042.504,5058.686,"I suspect we were invited but we did not have the internal mechanisms to what happened we were invited to and engage, and a more direct, clearer, please tell us about your technologies and engage your case, we are happy on that.",153,,
672,0.97,5058.686,5064.292,And I am not trying to pass the Beak Buck on this.,153,,
673,0.97,5064.292,5076.104,"We are happy to engage, and I heard from the Commenters that they want engagement and answers from the police Department, and I think we are absolutely in a possession to provide those, so, thank you.",153,,
674,0.97,5076.104,5078.873,"Yeah, and I like the idea of getting on a call.",154,,
675,0.97,5078.873,5082.877,It's not just you explaining the technology.,154,,
676,0.97,5082.877,5088.116,"It's people being able to ask questions, and that could maybe stream line the process going forward.",154,,
677,0.97,5088.116,5092.32,And we are going to end at 11:00.,154,,
678,0.97,5092.32,5094.789,But I did have one question.,154,,
679,0.97,5094.789,5098.126,"And in a public safety committee meeting, I think it was--I can't remember.",154,,
680,0.97,5098.126,5106.668,I think it was two times ago we heard presentations on task forces.,154,,
681,0.97,5106.668,5113.608,Is this the sort of technology that is used in the task forces that we are mostly looking at?,154,,
682,0.97,5113.608,5128.356,Is that just sort of work that we are deploying new technology is for with the task forces?,154,,
683,0.97,5128.49,5144.272,"I can't speak to what the agencies themselves use but within SPD, this is used by the gun violence prevention and Homicide unit and it could be used by Spencer A█Nd his counterpart by a detective Wrking with the gun violence task force.",155,,
684,0.97,5144.272,5154.616,"If they have information that they can bring in and added to an analysis chart, they would bring it in.",155,,
685,0.97,5154.616,5160.421,That is how it could be used but not exclusively.,155,,
686,0.97,5160.421,5164.092,All right.,156,,
687,0.97,5164.092,5166.294,"Thank you very, very much for your presentations.",156,,
688,0.97,5166.294,5176.07,We will take this up again at the May 11 committee meeting and there is no other comment or questions I will adjourn this meeting.,156,,
689,0.97,5176.07,5176.437,Looking around.,156,,
690,0.97,5176.437,5177.238,Okay.,156,,
691,0.97,5177.238,5178.74,This meeting is adjourned.,156,,
692,0.97,5178.74,5179.741,Thank you all.,156,,
693,0.97,5179.741,5180.208,Bye-Bye.,156,,
694,0.97,5180.208,5180.742,Thank you.,157,,
695,0.97,5180.742,5181.476,Thank you.,158,,
