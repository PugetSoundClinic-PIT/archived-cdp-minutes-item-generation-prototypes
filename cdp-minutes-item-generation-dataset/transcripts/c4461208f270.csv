83,0.97,725.925,733.365,Approximately 1 million of the funds being transferred by the Council bill are the human services departments community facilities program.,40,,
84,0.97,733.365,748.18,And then the intention of that funding was for community care facilities for seniors as part of the North lot project.,40,,
85,0.97,748.18,750.049,At the pack met center in beacon Hill.,40,,
86,0.97,750.049,761.76,"And, what we have heard is that the project is not quite ready to use those funds in 2020, and is okay with us using those funds for a different purpose.",40,,
87,0.97,761.76,777.51,"So, we believe that in 2020 one or 2022, we have other funds that we can devote to that time we can devote to the project more useful funds.",40,,

96,0.97,808.24,829.461,"I do have one question, Yolanda was looking at, my understanding is that the intent is to use kind of a lottery system for awarding, because we have so many small businesses and people who have applied, I wonder if there is any additional information about how this process will work.",46,,
97,0.97,829.461,856.555,"I can tell you that the lottery is going to be a weighted lottery system, so that the office of economic development has stated that, their goal is that 80 percent of these awards go through the neighborhoods at highest risk of businesses and neighborhoods that are at highest risk of displacement.",47,,
98,0.97,856.555,857.99,Thank you.,48,,

118,0.97,916.515,918.25,"I'm good, thank you.",62,,
119,0.97,918.25,932.665,"Great, thank you so much to counsel central staff for that description of the bill and follow-up, the answers to some of these questions, and thank you to Councilmember Morales for questions and detail.",63,,
120,0.97,932.665,944.977,"I know particularly protections of small businesses are very important, and that you have continued to Prioritize those issues and this is certainly an important moment to continue doing that work.",63,,
121,0.97,944.977,953.185,"I also understand that you have an amendment, to the bill, so we will go ahead and consider your amendment first.",63,,
122,0.97,953.185,958.357,"And then, we will go ahead and vote on the underlying bill, if and once it is amended.",63,,

124,0.97,965.698,966.799,Thank you.,64,,
125,0.97,966.799,976.975,"So, as Yolanda said, we do have lots of businesses who are very worried about how they will survive the crisis.",64,,
126,0.97,976.975,985.551,"And, this is going to be an important fund to help for a couple of hundred businesses, so I understand we need to move quickly.",64,,
127,0.97,985.551,999.098,"And, I worry, but in our case, we react to the crisis that we might set in motion some systems that will perpetuate inequities in our city.",64,,
128,0.97,999.098,1007.673,"So, I just want to make sure we have an equitable process for awarding these funds, and any other funding that we make available to Seattleites in response to this crisis.",64,,
129,0.97,1007.673,1020.019,"So, we have I think about 36,000 small businesses in Seattle, thousands of them are owned by people who don't speak English.",64,,
130,0.97,1020.019,1045.544,"Applications for this fund were available Online, but only in English, if you speak English you can fill out the application Online, and hit send, but it was a couple of days before they were made available, in other languages on the Online application had to be printed out and mailed in are handed in, to an outreach.",64,,
131,0.97,1045.544,1051.683,"When those who don't speak English have extra barriers put in place in order to produce a bit, we know that we have got some issues.",64,,
132,0.97,1051.683,1089.121,"And, I know that there was not any mail intent here, what we have instead is a small example of how, you know, very often are city government operates with Blinders on to anyone who is not a part of the dominant culture and we really have to change the way our city functions, so that everyone has access to these resources is a rather than slow down the disbursement of this particular fund I am asking that we hear back from Oed this summer about how the funds were distributed, you know, how many applicants did we get from people who don't speak English.",64,,
133,0.97,1089.121,1095.894,"How many were awarded to folks who don't speak English, and just making sure that you know, non-English speakers also get access to these opportunities.",64,,
134,0.97,1095.894,1117.516,"So if we are going to live up to our social justice goals, we have to be thoughtful about improving every aspect of our work and especially as we create the emergency responses to the crisis, I think it is really incumbent upon us to make sure that we are not perpetuating systems of inequity.",64,,
135,0.97,1117.516,1150.849,"Even if it means that we slow down our response a little bit, we really need to make sure that people of color, low income folks, limited English speakers have access to the information they need, so that they can receive emergency relief, and so, that is the spirit in which this amendment is offered, it is not a requirement that Oed provides the report it is merely a request that we hear back from them about how this money was distributed.",64,,
136,0.97,1150.849,1156.455,"Thank you for that description of the amendment, Councilmember Morales, I still need you to move the amendments.",65,,
