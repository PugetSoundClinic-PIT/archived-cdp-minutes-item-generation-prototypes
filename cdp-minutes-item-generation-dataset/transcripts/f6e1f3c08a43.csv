63,0.97,350.283,355.555,The plan will restore Transit- related capital projects that had to be reduced or canceled because of budget reductions.,11,,

76,0.97,412.578,426.192,And I'm giving public comment to oppose resolution 31988 which will take 29 public parking spaces and turn them into 16 private parking spaces.,13,,
77,0.97,426.192,434.0,"We absolutely do need to do something better with the space Besides use it to store vehicles, however this plan doesn't do that.",13,,
78,0.97,434.0,445.077,It just turns over the lot to a wealthy Landowner for the private use of their vehicles for their employees and customers.,13,,
79,0.97,445.077,445.545,Let me repeat that.,13,,
80,0.97,445.545,452.685,We turn over this lot to wealthy landowners for the private use of their own vehicles.,13,,
81,0.97,452.685,458.124,"The resulting Plaza that we get in return is not, it's going to be surrounded by parked cars.",13,,
82,0.97,458.124,463.196,It's going to be at the bottom of a set of stairs.,13,,
83,0.97,463.196,475.208,Anybody who needs to use mobility device will have to roll all the way around three blocks to get to it from the place where people normally are Congregating at the top of the stairs.,13,,
84,0.97,475.208,484.984,And it's separated also from it residents by these very office buildings that get to use the parking we turn over to them.,13,,
85,0.97,484.984,500.132,All of the housing and all that sort of stuff is on the other side of these office buildings basically turns it into a nice little surrounded lunch and break area for the employees of the places.,13,,
86,0.97,500.132,500.933,Which that's kind of nice.,13,,
87,0.97,500.933,501.2,For them.,13,,
88,0.97,501.2,505.137,I the long term we should do something much better with this.,13,,
89,0.97,505.137,506.005,Turn it into a park.,13,,
90,0.97,506.005,510.509,Put it N some pub Restrooms.,13,,
91,0.97,510.509,516.115,"I don't know what we can do with this, but something better than parking.",13,,

104,0.97,569.769,572.271,My comments are on the surveillance Technologies.,15,,
105,0.97,572.271,578.811,"I've read all the surveillance impact reports, public comments and privacy and civil liberties impact assessments.",15,,
106,0.97,578.811,582.248,My experience working in big Tech aids my analysis.,15,,
107,0.97,582.248,586.118,I sent written public comments by three E-Mails.,15,,
108,0.97,586.118,589.622,For Seattle city lights current diversion Technologies.,15,,
109,0.97,589.622,596.629,"Equity analysis, lack of written policy and access.",15,,
110,0.97,596.629,604.904,"For Seethe--Exercisive data retention, broad data sharing, system administration, Cyber security and racial bias analysis.",15,,
111,0.97,604.904,607.606,The issues with the SPD Technologies are more severe.,15,,
112,0.97,607.606,613.045,The biggest problem is the service being posted as opposed to on premise which is supported.,15,,
113,0.97,613.045,623.356,Cop logic is the result of a merger between three data brokers.,15,,
114,0.97,623.356,629.929,"Other problems span Cyber security data Reinvention, auditing and privacy policy coverage.",15,,
115,0.97,629.929,630.596,These would be minimized.,15,,
116,0.97,630.596,639.939,For automated license plate readers for patrol the most glaring issue is retention of data for license plates that are not a match list to a hot list.,15,,
117,0.97,639.939,641.64,"Cyber security, policy, audit, data sharing.",15,,
118,0.97,641.64,654.754,The severity of these issues would be reduced if SPD simply operated like New Hampshire and didn't retain data that didn't hit.,15,,
119,0.97,654.754,659.992,This system is mass location surveillance of almost exclusively innocent individuals.,15,,
120,0.97,659.992,670.403,"Given that parking enforcement was handed off and 911 operations have been moved to civilian control, the parking enforcement and 911 logging recorder are all out of date.",15,,
121,0.97,670.403,677.61,They are no longer on the SPD network or administration.,15,,
122,0.97,677.61,681.614,Approving such as is enables substantiation of these departments.,15,,
123,0.97,681.614,684.35,Please see my prior E-Mails for the full details.,15,,
124,0.97,684.35,686.318,Please don't rubber stamp these.,15,,

136,0.97,720.386,725.925,I live on capital Hill and I early morning you to vote no on resolution 31988.,17,,
137,0.97,725.925,733.232,This is just another give away of valuable public space that should be put to better full public use.,17,,
138,0.97,733.232,736.235,"Housing, social service facilities or green space or something else.",17,,
139,0.97,736.235,746.512,The meager offering of partial payment for a tiny Plaza that will offer people a view of a parking lot is pretty much Laughable and should not be considered an Amenity.,17,,
140,0.97,746.512,752.384,"It's time to stop giving away valuable public assets for private use, especially for parking.",17,,
141,0.97,752.384,768.067,We already have five Offstreet parking spaces per household in Seattle and according to the most recent U.S. census measure almost 20% of us living here don't even have access to a car so it's just to use it for parking is just kind of absurd and not equitable.,17,,
142,0.97,768.067,777.81,So again I urge you to vote no on this resolution and use that space for better fully public use.,17,,
143,0.97,777.81,778.144,Thank you.,17,,

187,0.97,994.493,995.761,Thank you.,25,,
188,0.97,995.761,996.729,Good morning.,25,,
189,0.97,996.729,997.196,I'm Jay Arnold.,25,,
190,0.97,997.196,1003.135,Deputy Mayor of Kirkland and vice chair of the East trail regional advisory Council.,25,,
191,0.97,1003.135,1019.818,Thank you for the opportunity to speak today to express the city of Kirkland's appreciation finish the city of Seattle working with us to make the transaction a reality in support of an important project in Kirkland's urban center.,25,,
192,0.97,1019.818,1035.868,"Experiencing explosive growth and redevelopment and to help provide transportation capacity to serve this area Kirkland is constructing a $22 million Nonmotorized bridge to improve access and use of the corridor, part of the regional trail system.",25,,
193,0.97,1035.868,1042.074,The bridge is key to connecting the corridor and the broader East trail to the trail.,25,,
194,0.97,1042.074,1051.784,In your packet is a rendering that shows the bridge which should be completed in 2022.,25,,
195,0.97,1051.784,1060.159,One of the Footings for the bridge is located within the Seattle city light easement and this allows that footing to remain in place.,25,,
196,0.97,1060.159,1076.442,"We also want to thank Debra Smith, general manager of Seattle city light and her staff for working Collaboratively with staff to make this a reality ensuring that both transportation and electric infrastructure work effectively in the same location.",25,,
197,0.97,1076.442,1076.742,Thank you.,25,,
198,0.97,1076.742,1079.278,Thank you very much for calling in it.,26,,
199,0.97,1079.278,1081.88,We appreciate that.,26,,
200,0.97,1081.88,1090.989,That was our last Speaker present at this public hearing so the public hearing on Council bill 120008 is now closed.,26,,
201,0.97,1090.989,1099.097,And we will go ahead and hear first from our city council analyst Eric Mcconaghy.,26,,
202,0.97,1099.097,1105.137,Who I think will want to turn over to Debra Smith and her team.,26,,
203,0.97,1105.137,1105.37,Yep.,27,,
204,0.97,1105.37,1106.004,Very much so.,27,,
205,0.97,1106.004,1106.638,Good morning.,27,,
206,0.97,1106.638,1110.742,As you said I'm Eric Mcconaghy.,27,,
207,0.97,1110.742,1119.551,I don't have a lot to add to what you've said and what the Speaker said other than to note it's interesting that the summary and fiscal note.,27,,
208,0.97,1119.551,1122.955,A piece of information that accompanies every piece of legislation to the Council.,27,,
209,0.97,1122.955,1127.626,They're offered by people in the departments such as city light or folks like myself.,27,,
210,0.97,1127.626,1132.865,This is an example of a change that happened last year.,27,,
211,0.97,1132.865,1139.404,"Climate resiliency is a big deal and Council with your leadership, changed the requirement format.",27,,
212,0.97,1139.404,1150.349,This is a good example of showing in the note how this trail should this bill pass will assist with climate resiliency.,27,,
213,0.97,1150.349,1151.483,Providing an alternate transportation route.,27,,
214,0.97,1151.483,1152.951,It may seem to be a footnote.,27,,
215,0.97,1152.951,1157.756,I think it's an example of things to come and a good example of the use of that change.,27,,
216,0.97,1157.756,1163.896,So I just thought I'd bring it up.,27,,
217,0.97,1163.896,1170.202,"You'll be available for questions during this, although I'm hoping this item will go quickly since we have such a long agenda.",28,,
218,0.97,1170.202,1174.907,I'd like to turn it over to general manager of city light Debra Smith.,28,,
219,0.97,1174.907,1183.815,I think we in fact Councilmember Pedersen we can make up some time here.,29,,
220,0.97,1183.815,1188.12,I want to thank Mr. Arnold and the city of Kirkland for working with us on this.,29,,
221,0.97,1188.12,1200.799,This is another good example of where we the city and city light need to work closely with fast growing East side communities on their development efforts in order to protect our critical transmission corridor.,29,,
222,0.97,1200.799,1215.314,So the point here is that both are possible if it we work Collaboratively and creatively to develop solutions that allow us all to move forward and protect for the future.,29,,
223,0.97,1215.314,1221.687,So thank you and just I'll introduce staff and meet.,29,,
224,0.97,1221.687,1230.729,"I have Tom Deboer, our officer of environmental lands and licensing.",29,,
225,0.97,1230.729,1231.129,Bill Deveraux.,29,,
226,0.97,1231.129,1232.03,I'm terrible with titles.,29,,
227,0.97,1232.03,1238.337,"Bill does something that's mostly about, he does compliance and real estate.",29,,
228,0.97,1238.337,1247.613,"And Greg Sancewich, I always give every time I remind him he came to work for us from sound transit, went back to sound transit then came back to us.",29,,
229,0.97,1247.613,1252.818,I think his value is important because he does understand the importance of the transportation corridors.,29,,
230,0.97,1252.818,1261.827,And this is not the first example where we've been able to successfully work through an issue at least in part due to Greg and bill's involvement.,29,,
231,0.97,1261.827,1262.961,Tom wasn't here.,29,,
232,0.97,1262.961,1268.4,"And Lastly, of course, maw are Brueger who keeps us all on track.",29,,
233,0.97,1268.4,1282.714,Council member Juarez thank you for joining us so we can get this important piece of work through.,29,,
234,0.97,1282.714,1283.815,Thank you.,29,,
235,0.97,1283.815,1284.583,Good morning.,30,,
236,0.97,1284.583,1293.258,Today's action requests authorization to release a portion of city light's transmission.,30,,
237,0.97,1293.258,1294.026,Line easement locating Kirkland.,30,,
238,0.97,1294.026,1299.765,The portion of the easement release is for the surface rights.,30,,
239,0.97,1299.765,1309.808,It allows for the Totem light Connector which is this over here on the right hand side you'll see in the presentation.,30,,
240,0.97,1309.808,1311.176,This bridge structure that spans.,30,,
241,0.97,1311.176,1313.211,It's part of the larger East side trail connection.,30,,
242,0.97,1313.211,1317.149,On the left side of the screen.,30,,
243,0.97,1317.149,1324.523,You'll see the larger corridor that runs between Renton and up into Snohomish County.,30,,
244,0.97,1324.523,1330.162,You can see a rendering has a depiction of where our tower is.,30,,
245,0.97,1330.162,1336.201,That's the Western edge of our Easesment corridor.,30,,
246,0.97,1336.201,1338.87,"Portion releases for approximately 24,000 square feet.",30,,
247,0.97,1338.87,1343.942,"Require the city of Kirkland to make a one time payment of $19,500.",30,,
248,0.97,1343.942,1362.794,The cooperation efforts put together by both city of Kirkland and city light allowed us to preserve the safe and reliable distribution of our electricity and also a safe and reliable option for trail users.,30,,
249,0.97,1362.794,1372.07,Separated crossing for Nonmotorized use allows a connection for the regional trail system.,30,,
250,0.97,1372.07,1377.709,That's pretty much all we have today for our presentation.,30,,
251,0.97,1377.709,1378.21,Hopefully it's clear.,30,,
252,0.97,1378.21,1378.577,Thank you.,31,,
253,0.97,1378.577,1387.619,"Just for the benefit of the council member Juarez, this is not in your district but I hope that you support it.",31,,
254,0.97,1387.619,1391.69,You have your awesome pedestrian bike path.,31,,
255,0.97,1391.69,1399.965,Which is coming along so well over I-5 . Thank you folks from city light for sharing this with us.,31,,
256,0.97,1399.965,1410.409,Councilmembers do you have questions or comments about this potential easement which we'll actually vote on in the next meeting?,31,,
257,0.97,1410.409,1410.909,Councilmember Strauss.,31,,
258,0.97,1410.909,1411.743,Thank you.,32,,
259,0.97,1411.743,1420.419,Just noting that sometimes it is that one very small connection that can unlock so much of our Multimodal trails.,32,,
260,0.97,1420.419,1431.463,With this connection you and I will be able to bike from my district through your district through Councilmember Juarez' district and get to Kirkland safe and separated.,32,,
261,0.97,1431.463,1433.165,Just wanted to make that note.,32,,
262,0.97,1433.165,1433.565,Appreciate that.,32,,
263,0.97,1433.565,1438.069,I did have one question for Greg.,32,,
264,0.97,1438.069,1441.673,About the payment we will receive from Kirkland.,32,,
265,0.97,1441.673,1444.743,Are these going to be restricted rate payer funds?,32,,
266,0.97,1444.743,1446.278,Are they going to the general fund?,32,,
267,0.97,1446.278,1452.951,What is their use and how does it benefit city light?,32,,
268,0.97,1452.951,1454.82,Proceeds from any dispositions --,33,,
269,0.97,1454.82,1461.092,"Just also understanding $19,000 in the scope of city light's budget is not a lot.",34,,
270,0.97,1461.092,1463.595,Still we know it can help in certain ways.,34,,
271,0.97,1463.595,1470.235,Are there projects that it's going to help fund or is it just going for general fund use?,34,,
272,0.97,1470.235,1470.702,Yeah.,35,,
273,0.97,1470.702,1480.612,So city light fund breeds any Surplussing disposition we receive from those actions will go into city light's general fund.,35,,
274,0.97,1480.612,1484.816,Those funds help offset rate payer costs for other projects we have on going.,35,,
275,0.97,1484.816,1497.662,"The $19,500 is not a large amount but it is an amount that helps us further defer any other rate increases or impacts to rate.",35,,
276,0.97,1497.662,1498.163,Thank you so much.,36,,
277,0.97,1498.163,1500.098,That's all my questions for today.,36,,
278,0.97,1500.098,1502.1,Thank you.,37,,
279,0.97,1502.1,1504.836,Any other questions or comments?,37,,
280,0.97,1504.836,1505.337,Councilmember Herbold.,37,,
281,0.97,1505.337,1506.738,Thank you.,38,,
282,0.97,1506.738,1508.173,You may have covered this.,38,,
283,0.97,1508.173,1517.883,Can you talk a bit about whether and how access is maintained in case Seattle city light needs it?,38,,
284,0.97,1517.883,1519.818,Yeah.,39,,
285,0.97,1519.818,1522.52,Let me bring this back up.,39,,
286,0.97,1522.52,1527.626,So if you look closely at the rendering if I can share this for you.,39,,
287,0.97,1527.626,1536.902,The access because of where it's located it's actually in a portion of the Totem Lake sensitive area.,39,,
288,0.97,1536.902,1537.969,Where the landing is.,39,,
289,0.97,1537.969,1541.006,Our trucks can't go to where the bridge structure is.,39,,
290,0.97,1541.006,1544.576,So there's enough infrastructure in and around the tower.,39,,
291,0.97,1544.576,1550.548,That was one of the key components of this whole coordination.,39,,
292,0.97,1550.548,1553.985,So we do have that preserved.,39,,
293,0.97,1553.985,1556.254,Thank you.,40,,
294,0.97,1556.254,1561.092,Thanks for that question.,41,,
295,0.97,1561.092,1561.993,"Councilmembers, any other questions?",41,,
296,0.97,1561.993,1562.193,Okay.,41,,
297,0.97,1562.193,1566.598,"Well thanks, everybody from city light for being here and Eric, appreciate it.",41,,
298,0.97,1566.598,1569.401,We will vote on this easement in our next committee meeting.,41,,
299,0.97,1569.401,1573.571,We have this today for our public hearing and the presentation.,41,,
300,0.97,1573.571,1580.545,"So on March 17th this will be voted on quickly, I would assume.",41,,
301,0.97,1580.545,1580.979,"Thanks, everybody.",41,,
302,0.97,1580.979,1590.622,Will the clerk read the title of the next agenda item into the record?,41,,
303,0.97,1590.622,1592.59,Agenda item two.,42,,
304,0.97,1592.59,1593.491,Resolution 31988.,42,,
305,0.97,1593.491,1613.478,"A resolution granting conceptual approval to construct, maintain and operate a private parking area on East Howe Street east of Fairview Avenue East as proposed by Bsop 1 LLC as part of developing a public Plaza in unopened right of way in the Eastlake neighborhood.",42,,
306,0.97,1613.478,1618.049,"For briefing, discussion and possible vote.",42,,
307,0.97,1618.049,1619.05,Thank you.,43,,
308,0.97,1619.05,1632.998,"This resolution is granting a term limited permit that would basically, the concept of a term limited permit that would create a small public Plaza where a handful of parking spaces currently exist.",43,,
309,0.97,1632.998,1639.938,I went out and visited this site a couple of times.,43,,
310,0.97,1639.938,1645.744,And appreciate the Department and neighborhoods running their public process.,43,,
311,0.97,1645.744,1652.651,We're going to hear from Lish from central staff and then from the departments and I think some folks from the community.,43,,
312,0.97,1652.651,1655.086,So Lish if you don't mind starting us off.,43,,
313,0.97,1655.086,1660.058,Thank you for your memo.,43,,
314,0.97,1660.058,1660.925,Sure.,44,,
315,0.97,1660.925,1661.359,Lish Whitson.,44,,
316,0.97,1661.359,1668.666,This is a resolution that would grant conceptual approval of a term permit.,44,,
317,0.97,1668.666,1674.039,Term permits generally run for 10 to 15 years.,44,,
318,0.97,1674.039,1677.976,And often can be renewed.,44,,
319,0.97,1677.976,1691.322,In making your decision on whether or not to grant conceptual approval the code lays out ten different criteria included in my memo.,44,,
320,0.97,1691.322,1698.797,Including whether or not there would be interruption or interference with existing Streetscape or other Street amenities.,44,,
321,0.97,1698.797,1699.898,Affect on pedestrian activity.,44,,
322,0.97,1699.898,1706.738,Affect on Commerce and enjoyment of neighboring land uses.,44,,
323,0.97,1706.738,1711.843,The availability of reasonable alternatives.,44,,
324,0.97,1711.843,1720.785,"So as you're considering this resolution and hearing presentation, please keep in mind those criteria.",44,,
325,0.97,1720.785,1730.195,With that I'll hand it off to the other Presenters.,44,,
326,0.97,1730.195,1730.628,Beverly.,45,,
327,0.97,1730.628,1732.23,"Good morning, everyone.",46,,
328,0.97,1732.23,1734.933,I'm going to start us off with a couple minute overview.,46,,
329,0.97,1734.933,1736.234,What we have for you today.,46,,
330,0.97,1736.234,1745.71,Amy gray is going to go through the term permit Powerpoint so we'll be able to see some maps of the area and she'll explain the term permit process.,46,,
331,0.97,1745.71,1749.08,Following up on some of the comments that Lish made.,46,,
332,0.97,1749.08,1758.089,We also have with us two representatives of the Eastlake community that have worked on this.,46,,
333,0.97,1758.089,1763.561,Ron and Deitra and they're going to talk about the community process that brought this idea forward.,46,,
334,0.97,1763.561,1768.5,We'll respond to the public hearing comments.,46,,
335,0.97,1768.5,1774.706,I think this one is a little bit unusual which is why I wanted to say something before we jumped into the Powerpoint.,46,,
336,0.97,1774.706,1790.221,I think that committee has a lot of experience with term permits are it's normally an adjacent property owner wants to do a utility tunnel or something like that and that permit is the way we accommodate that partial use of the public right of way.,46,,
337,0.97,1790.221,1809.807,This is a little different in this idea has really been championed by the East Howe step steering committee which is a Community-Based organization that has worked on increasing community connections between the community and the Lake for many years.,46,,
338,0.97,1809.807,1819.551,In 2018 the Department of neighborhoods facilitated the community and developer working to come up with an agreement which we'll be going through.,46,,
339,0.97,1819.551,1835.266,"What you're seeing is Sdot's support of a term permit that really implements this agreement between the community organization and the adjacent developer with the awkward name of Bsop 1, LLC.",46,,
340,0.97,1835.266,1849.08,I think we can jump into the Powerpoint and then Amy's going to be sharing this with our community reps and we also have some of the design team that worked on this.,46,,
341,0.97,1849.08,1851.716,Michael Jenkins and most everyone you can think of.,46,,
342,0.97,1851.716,1860.158,"So I think we're ready to jump into the Powerpoint then, Amy.",46,,
343,0.97,1860.158,1860.592,Thank you.,46,,
344,0.97,1860.592,1861.326,Thank you.,47,,
345,0.97,1861.326,1861.659,Good morning.,47,,
346,0.97,1861.659,1864.863,Thank you for the opportunity to present this project to you today.,47,,
347,0.97,1864.863,1866.197,My name is Amy gray.,47,,
348,0.97,1866.197,1873.538,I work for the Seattle Department of transportation on the term permit program.,47,,
349,0.97,1873.538,1891.656,"As Beverly mentioned the Department of neighborhoods facilitated an Mou between Bsop 1, LLC and the East Howe steering committee to come up with a plan for this area in unopened East Howe.",47,,
350,0.97,1891.656,1898.763,"Bso P will contribute $500,000 towards the development and maintenance of the new Plaza.",47,,
351,0.97,1898.763,1908.239,"So that's important because they're not just creating it without having an on going maintenance plan so it would just, nobody would be responsible.",47,,
352,0.97,1908.239,1913.244,Bsop will continue to maintain the public Plaza.,47,,
353,0.97,1913.244,1924.255,Bsop is seeking a new permit for private weekday parking in East Howe street that is currently unopened and not used for transportation purposes.,47,,
354,0.97,1924.255,1932.664,And the steering committee supports the private weekday parking and Sdot is recommending approval.,47,,
355,0.97,1932.664,1932.964,Next slide.,47,,
356,0.97,1932.964,1951.883,"So just because there's a lot of names out there that people might not be familiar with, Bsop 1, LLC is the property owner and existing office that uses parking in unopened East Howe right of way now.",47,,
357,0.97,1951.883,1959.691,The East Howe steps Plaza community is a group of members who participated in the development of the Moa for the public approval in this area.,47,,
358,0.97,1959.691,1970.101,There will be I'll turn it over later in the presentation to the community members representing the steering committee.,47,,
359,0.97,1970.101,1970.868,"Next slide, please.",47,,
360,0.97,1970.868,1973.838,So here is what dated aerial map of the area.,47,,
361,0.97,1973.838,1980.912,The Star shows the portion of unopened East Howe to the South where it looks like it's a vacant lot.,47,,
362,0.97,1980.912,1983.181,That's a brand new development.,47,,
363,0.97,1983.181,1988.619,To the North is 1910 Fairview Avenue East.,47,,
364,0.97,1988.619,1988.92,Next slide.,47,,
365,0.97,1988.92,1994.258,"As Beverly touched upon, term permits are two step process.",47,,
366,0.97,1994.258,2002.433,The first step which is to provide conceptual approval.,47,,
367,0.97,2002.433,2020.651,"And then if Council, we'll come back to you for final approval through a term permit ordinance that specifies all the terms, conditions, fees, inspection requirements, viability insurance, remove and restore obligations of the permit holder.",47,,
368,0.97,2020.651,2028.559,But that will all happen if Council provides conceptual approval.,47,,
369,0.97,2028.559,2028.86,Next slide.,47,,
370,0.97,2028.86,2030.895,So here's the proposal.,47,,
371,0.97,2030.895,2034.866,This image shows the public Plaza being developed.,47,,
372,0.97,2034.866,2043.241,The red dots show the 16 private weekday parking spots and the blue dots show the four public stalls.,47,,
373,0.97,2043.241,2053.017,The steering committee received matching fund grant from the Department of neighborhoods for the permitting of the Plaza.,47,,
374,0.97,2053.017,2057.755,"Bsop 1, LLC will accommodate up to 12 community events in this area.",47,,
375,0.97,2057.755,2064.095,That is specified in the memorandum of understanding between them and the steering committee.,47,,
376,0.97,2064.095,2075.173,And at this point I was going to turn it over to Juliet from the design team and the steering committee.,47,,
377,0.97,2075.173,2077.408,"Thank you very much, Amy.",48,,
378,0.97,2077.408,2084.382,Going to start us off and then I'll follow up with a little more description.,48,,
379,0.97,2084.382,2090.788,"Just from an introduction standpoint, I am with Hbb landscape architecture.",48,,
380,0.97,2090.788,2111.242,I'm a design consultant working to develop faster plans in the public process and the design drawings to get us where we are here today.,48,,
381,0.97,2111.242,2112.743,This is Ron.,49,,
382,0.97,2112.743,2113.978,I can go over the slide.,49,,
383,0.97,2113.978,2117.648,Also here to help answer questions.,49,,
384,0.97,2117.648,2123.254,I'm a long time resident of the East Lake community.,49,,
385,0.97,2123.254,2129.594,I have been the chair of the steering committee that has worked on this project for the last seven years.,49,,
386,0.97,2129.594,2138.669,It has taken some time to go through the initial planning and design for this project.,49,,
387,0.97,2138.669,2141.739,But we've come a long way.,49,,
388,0.97,2141.739,2143.574,We've made good progress on it.,49,,
389,0.97,2143.574,2155.019,Through support through Department of neighborhood planning grants we held four community meetings to look at different design concepts.,49,,
390,0.97,2155.019,2185.216,We addressed a lot of design questions and parking questions that came up and we're very happy to be at a position where we've come together and have a proposed solution to move forward that would allow the creation of this great new public Plaza open space along Fairview Avenue.,49,,
391,0.97,2185.216,2194.825,Which provides connections uphill through the East Howe steps connection and also connection to the trail that goes along Lake Union.,49,,
392,0.97,2194.825,2198.629,This has been a collaborative process.,49,,
393,0.97,2198.629,2206.137,The community has initiated and led the design supported by Department and neighborhood grants.,49,,
394,0.97,2206.137,2222.286,We have funded the design and permit process to the adjacent property owner would fund the construction of the Plaza and would be responsible for the long term maintenance of the Plaza once it's done.,49,,
395,0.97,2222.286,2227.758,We support this effort and thank you for your consideration of this item this morning.,49,,
396,0.97,2227.758,2233.197,Do you want to talk more about the design?,49,,
397,0.97,2233.197,2233.464,Yeah.,50,,
398,0.97,2233.464,2238.536,So I've been asked to walk through a couple of key components.,50,,
399,0.97,2238.536,2249.78,I guess along just building off what Ron had mentioned we have three public meetings to develop an original master plan.,50,,
400,0.97,2249.78,2258.189,We discussed lots of comments and P one of the big elements was to really be able to provide a Terracing of the steps.,50,,
401,0.97,2258.189,2268.099,"Once the Mou was developed and the final sight plan, that's when we had that fourth meeting to make sure the community was aware of this partnership approach.",50,,
402,0.97,2268.099,2271.469,We've been working with Sdot to develop the final design.,50,,
403,0.97,2271.469,2280.878,One of the major comment they had in the design process was to do everything we could to make sure we didn't disturb the root limits of this existing tree.,50,,
404,0.97,2280.878,2287.051,This is a large existing Conifer in healthy condition.,50,,
405,0.97,2287.051,2291.522,We've been working to make sure we adjust the design around this tree.,50,,
406,0.97,2291.522,2294.859,It sits in a parking planted Island.,50,,
407,0.97,2294.859,2302.133,We are retaining the full extent of that existing planting Island.,50,,
408,0.97,2302.133,2307.605,So we have no disturbance beyond what's already paved.,50,,
409,0.97,2307.605,2308.973,We presented a subcommittee meeting.,50,,
410,0.97,2308.973,2312.443,We've adjusted some of the design to reflect their comments.,50,,
411,0.97,2312.443,2316.681,Most of their comments were related to the public accessibility of this Plaza.,50,,
412,0.97,2316.681,2321.952,So we've dope a few things to make sure the Plaza is open.,50,,
413,0.97,2321.952,2322.553,That it feels open visually.,50,,
414,0.97,2322.553,2328.192,It is like all of the design elements come together to make sure it feels like an open public space.,50,,
415,0.97,2328.192,2329.627,That the stalls are all signed.,50,,
416,0.97,2329.627,2334.165,It's clear this is a public space and the community is welcome.,50,,
417,0.97,2334.165,2346.877,We also look to work with them to make sure we had the right size spaces so we can support small term events as well as some larger events as you spill into the rest of that public right of way.,50,,
418,0.97,2346.877,2347.511,"Next slide, please.",50,,
419,0.97,2347.511,2355.753,"And could we ask, Oh, we'll have a couple of questions at the end here.",51,,
420,0.97,2355.753,2357.922,Keep going.,51,,
421,0.97,2357.922,2358.289,All right.,52,,
422,0.97,2358.289,2360.358,Couple of photos to show you.,52,,
423,0.97,2360.358,2363.461,Could I ask my question now?,53,,
424,0.97,2363.461,2363.961,Sure.,54,,
425,0.97,2363.961,2364.428,Great.,55,,
426,0.97,2364.428,2364.729,Thank you.,55,,
427,0.97,2364.729,2365.162,"Thank you, Juliet.",55,,
428,0.97,2365.162,2366.197,Thank you to the Presenters.,55,,
429,0.97,2366.197,2370.701,My questions were on slide six and then on slide seven.,55,,
430,0.97,2370.701,2370.935,Sorry.,55,,
431,0.97,2370.935,2375.439,I did not jump in soon enough.,55,,
432,0.97,2375.439,2384.081,Slide six does I guess this is when Beverly was or Amy was speaking about the public benefits.,55,,
433,0.97,2384.081,2386.984,We could go back to slide seven.,55,,
434,0.97,2386.984,2394.091,Really what's important for me to understand regarding public benefits is it's one thing to create a public benefit.,55,,
435,0.97,2394.091,2398.429,But if nobody knows about it it's not truly a public benefit.,55,,
436,0.97,2398.429,2406.237,What's important for me to understand is who can attend I think I heard you say there'd be Echts promoted or created.,55,,
437,0.97,2406.237,2408.072,"Who can attend, how is it advertised?",55,,
438,0.97,2408.072,2416.113,How do people know this is something that is free to them just as a resident or person in the city?,55,,
439,0.97,2416.113,2420.684,Is there storage available for these events?,55,,
440,0.97,2420.684,2425.122,I guess that's my first question.,55,,
441,0.97,2425.122,2425.556,I've got two more.,55,,
442,0.97,2425.556,2425.823,Sure.,56,,
443,0.97,2425.823,2429.226,Is it all right if I respond to that first one?,56,,
444,0.97,2429.226,2434.732,Do you want to say something first?,56,,
445,0.97,2434.732,2435.332,Go ahead.,57,,
446,0.97,2435.332,2435.733,All right.,58,,
447,0.97,2435.733,2437.434,So the entire space is open to the public.,58,,
448,0.97,2437.434,2446.811,That's a lot of what the Seattle design Commission comments were about is adjusting the design so it feels open visually.,58,,
449,0.97,2446.811,2448.345,Looks like it's open.,58,,
450,0.97,2448.345,2452.55,It is that inviting experience to clearly indicate.,58,,
451,0.97,2452.55,2455.452,So aside from the two trees you see on this corner plan.,58,,
452,0.97,2455.452,2463.093,When the planting is very low growing we made sure the visual connection from the sidewalk to the stairs to the steps is very clear.,58,,
453,0.97,2463.093,2471.969,So you can kind of start to get those sight lines and know this is where you go to make that Hill climb.,58,,
454,0.97,2471.969,2473.671,You asked about programming specifically.,58,,
455,0.97,2473.671,2481.512,So East Howe steering committee part of the public process has been to ask what types of things you'd want to do in the space.,58,,
456,0.97,2481.512,2482.012,What is it used for?,58,,
457,0.97,2482.012,2484.682,What would the community want to use it for?,58,,
458,0.97,2484.682,2490.921,Most of the responses we got was just the importance of having that visual respite.,58,,
459,0.97,2490.921,2493.09,A spot they can hang out.,58,,
460,0.97,2493.09,2496.76,We've elongated steps so they can hang out on the stairs.,58,,
461,0.97,2496.76,2501.065,Created seating with a have geared towards the downtown.,58,,
462,0.97,2501.065,2501.765,Not just the Lake.,58,,
463,0.97,2501.765,2505.569,Just having that open space in this location.,58,,
464,0.97,2505.569,2514.178,"The thought process was if someone was going to be, a small group is coming from the community to do the hill climb.",58,,
465,0.97,2514.178,2518.315,A popular fitness route to head up those stairs.,58,,
466,0.97,2518.315,2523.454,Or Lake to Lake also is a great urban hiking route.,58,,
467,0.97,2523.454,2529.059,A loft of the intended use is those small group gathering spots.,58,,
468,0.97,2529.059,2534.064,Bikers coming to meet here when they're going to bike around Lake Union.,58,,
469,0.97,2534.064,2539.003,There's a desire or a hope to host some slightly larger events.,58,,
470,0.97,2539.003,2558.088,"Being able to spill into the public parking lot really working in coordination with the Bsop group if there was ever going to be, you know, a, I don't know a fun run that wants to have a tent set up.",58,,
471,0.97,2558.088,2561.358,Any kinds of those uses would be open to the public.,58,,
472,0.97,2561.358,2574.605,There's kind of an understanding and expectation that we'll probably set some parameters around the 1910 and the steering committee specifically in regards to the 12 events for the Mou that have been Conceptualized.,58,,
473,0.97,2574.605,2586.85,Anybody could go through the typical Seattle process and request to hold some event here through the typical permitting process with any other type of open space and the right of way.,58,,
474,0.97,2586.85,2587.251,Thanks.,59,,
475,0.97,2587.251,2588.452,"Councilmember, if I may.",60,,
476,0.97,2588.452,2589.753,"Yeah, please jump in.",61,,
477,0.97,2589.753,2605.803,"For the record, Ian Morrison here on behalf of the term applicant Bsop 1. the twelve events that Sdot presentation, that is think of it as a write of first offer for the steering committee.",62,,
478,0.97,2605.803,2610.007,That's 12 events that the steering committee is able to do a year under the Mou.,62,,
479,0.97,2610.007,2619.65,There's still the opportunity for any other group to go through the normal permitting process in they wanted to do a festival event.,62,,
480,0.97,2619.65,2625.356,That's 12 events that are Prereserved for steering committee.,62,,
481,0.97,2625.356,2631.095,Your other question is part of the term permit will be Signage and way finding.,62,,
482,0.97,2631.095,2636.7,That be evolved should the committee choose to approve this.,62,,
483,0.97,2636.7,2639.069,There will be opportunities for Locational Signage.,62,,
484,0.97,2639.069,2643.374,That the parking is available to the public on nights and weekends.,62,,
485,0.97,2643.374,2647.478,Also of the stalls will be created if if the term permit was approved.,62,,
486,0.97,2647.478,2652.483,You started to answer Myfection question.,63,,
487,0.97,2652.483,2654.518,So my other question here.,63,,
488,0.97,2654.518,2660.29,I'll sit on the public events real quickly.,63,,
489,0.97,2660.29,2678.175,"What's going to be, just the first of two.",63,,
490,0.97,2678.175,2686.717,"Which is very clear, making it very clear for anyone in the city to understand that they are able to host events here.",63,,
491,0.97,2686.717,2699.663,"The onus should not be put on the individual to figure out for themselves that this is a place that is, that there's a public benefit for them to use we need to be Proactive.",63,,
492,0.97,2699.663,2706.136,Whether that's reaching out to local groups beyond just the East Howe group.,63,,
493,0.97,2706.136,2708.338,I'll leave the details up to you.,63,,
494,0.97,2708.338,2711.041,Just letting you know public benefits are important to me.,63,,
495,0.97,2711.041,2725.656,Understanding people should not have to go out of their way to achieve or receive these public benefits is crucial.,63,,
496,0.97,2725.656,2732.663,How clearly is it defined that these are public as compared to the rest of the private lot and then I have one more question about the tree.,63,,
497,0.97,2732.663,2733.43,Yeah.,64,,
498,0.97,2733.43,2736.333,So we're working with Sdot directly.,64,,
499,0.97,2736.333,2738.469,There'll be a sign on every stall.,64,,
500,0.97,2738.469,2750.314,Not just the public stalls but on every stall individually so that it's clear that they are public like all public all the time versus public evenings and weekends.,64,,
501,0.97,2750.314,2761.191,In addition I think we were Sdot is considering a sign at the street saying public parking.,64,,
502,0.97,2761.191,2769.933,The initial installation would include the stalls Signage for each and every stall.,64,,
503,0.97,2769.933,2773.337,We've been working for the language that goes on the signs.,64,,
504,0.97,2773.337,2782.78,There is a larger master plan that the community developed that involves more Connectivity and open space and improvements along the corridor.,64,,
505,0.97,2782.78,2783.313,Additional way finding.,64,,
506,0.97,2783.313,2787.251,Those things are all things that are still Conceptualized.,64,,
507,0.97,2787.251,2793.624,Have been brought up to Sdot that might be beneficial.,64,,
508,0.97,2793.624,2799.029,That's still that element is still in process.,64,,
509,0.97,2799.029,2806.537,I'm the President of the East Howe community Council and I've been on the steering committee for this project for the last five years.,65,,
510,0.97,2806.537,2811.308,Getting word out to the public is very important for us also.,65,,
511,0.97,2811.308,2819.683,We have a new Website and this will be on that as will the parks along Fairview.,65,,
512,0.97,2819.683,2824.521,"So anybody who is looking for, if they're taking a ride around the Lake.",65,,
513,0.97,2824.521,2824.988,Taking a walk.,65,,
514,0.97,2824.988,2832.362,They'll know this is there and what facilities are available.,65,,
515,0.97,2832.362,2832.696,Wonderful.,66,,
516,0.97,2832.696,2833.096,Thank you.,66,,
517,0.97,2833.096,2836.833,Thank you for the clarification about the parking stalls.,66,,
518,0.97,2836.833,2845.742,"If somebody is driving by on the street what looks like to be a private lot is not, it is not cop fused as a solely private lot.",66,,
519,0.97,2845.742,2849.046,"Don't worry, you're not the only ones I'm talking to about this.",66,,
520,0.97,2849.046,2854.685,I had a meeting yesterday where I was saying the same thing to a completely different group of people.,66,,
521,0.97,2854.685,2856.887,Job well done on all of this.,66,,
522,0.97,2856.887,2858.288,Especially on this tree.,66,,
523,0.97,2858.288,2866.563,I think this is a great example of how we can preserve the trees as we develop the land around this.,66,,
524,0.97,2866.563,2873.437,"You can't, if it we cut down that tree it would take, we would not be able to recoup that group.",66,,
525,0.97,2873.437,2883.981,Thank you for preserving that tree and creating what looks to be a good product.,66,,
526,0.97,2883.981,2884.348,Thank you.,66,,
527,0.97,2884.348,2884.715,Thank you.,67,,
528,0.97,2884.715,2884.948,Sorry.,67,,
529,0.97,2884.948,2885.315,Chair Pedersen.,67,,
530,0.97,2885.315,2889.186,I guess my question about the tree is what did it take to preserve that tree.,67,,
531,0.97,2889.186,2889.519,There we go.,67,,
532,0.97,2889.519,2889.82,Sorry.,68,,
533,0.97,2889.82,2894.324,I didn't hear the question in there.,68,,
534,0.97,2894.324,2903.934,So we were intending to preserve this tree from the early discussions with Sdot it was clear that was a strong desire.,68,,
535,0.97,2903.934,2915.078,"So really the urban forest or the changes made based on the recommendation, we dug around the tree to make sure we understood where the roots were and where they were going.",68,,
536,0.97,2915.078,2916.013,We did pocket investigation.,68,,
537,0.97,2916.013,2921.218,The recommendations were to leave the existing curb in place.,68,,
538,0.97,2921.218,2930.994,So that is where the majority of the roots are still focused and those major root systems in the landscape area where that's a large Island right now.,68,,
539,0.97,2930.994,2933.964,Essentially that's the primary element.,68,,
540,0.97,2933.964,2936.667,We had to Reshift the stall as little.,68,,
541,0.97,2936.667,2946.143,We lost one stall because there wasn't enough room without encroaching slightly into that existing landscape area.,68,,
542,0.97,2946.143,2951.381,"We adjusted where the stairs, where the Plaza turns and heads up through the existing stair way.",68,,
543,0.97,2951.381,2966.697,We adjusted that limitation so our grading would work to get the Terracing that was super important to the community while being able to not encroach on what would be kind of that East side of that existing tree.,68,,
544,0.97,2966.697,2976.773,So mostly it was slight site adjustments and shifting the parking and adjusting the size of the stalls within the required parking sizes.,68,,
545,0.97,2976.773,2978.008,To not encroach on that.,68,,
546,0.97,2978.008,2978.408,Great.,69,,
547,0.97,2978.408,2979.776,Thank you so much.,69,,
548,0.97,2979.776,2985.682,That one parking stall is definitely worth it.,69,,
549,0.97,2985.682,2985.983,Good job.,69,,
550,0.97,2985.983,2986.283,Thank you.,69,,
551,0.97,2986.283,2986.55,Yeah.,70,,
552,0.97,2986.55,2991.855,Please keep going with the presentation and I think we've got a couple questions at the end.,70,,
553,0.97,2991.855,2992.122,Sure.,71,,
554,0.97,2992.122,2996.827,Just a couple of slides to show what it looks like from the ground.,71,,
555,0.97,2996.827,3005.635,Facing East this is from the sidewalk what would be that entrance into the Plaza space.,71,,
556,0.97,3005.635,3019.149,What you see here is the approximation of the product line.,71,,
557,0.97,3019.149,3028.291,The goal was to elevate you a little so you'll be able to see as you come around the Corp.Er not just the Lake but the downtown.,71,,
558,0.97,3028.291,3031.561,I'd like to Interject here one quick thing for these slides.,72,,
559,0.97,3031.561,3043.774,"It occurred to a lot of us that if you're standing on the sidewalk there facing West or facing East, it doesn't, it reads right now as a private parking lot.",72,,
560,0.97,3043.774,3058.088,The most people would not understand that there's actually city right of way here.,72,,
561,0.97,3058.088,3071.234,The proposal is to make it more publicly known that this is an area for people to use as part of the Plaza and also do some reserved private parking for the weekdays.,72,,
562,0.97,3071.234,3089.653,This is probably also a good slide to show as well on the site plan if it we need to get into details the 1910 the private property was developed we spent a lot of time in our process just understanding where the parking and how it works and how it was originally permitted and constructed.,73,,
563,0.97,3089.653,3095.959,There is access to some of the private stalls in a driveway used for deliveries as well.,73,,
564,0.97,3095.959,3119.282,What we carefully tried to Orchestrate everything so that we weren't eliminating access to the private property itself and emergency access which was certainly important working with the fire Department turning Radiuses to maintain fire access around this building while still maximizing the space of the Plaza that we could in the area remaining.,73,,
565,0.97,3119.282,3124.054,The next slide just shows a couple more photos.,73,,
566,0.97,3124.054,3124.521,The existing steps.,73,,
567,0.97,3124.521,3131.761,The building you see here is the one that's currently developed the 1818 along Fairview.,73,,
568,0.97,3131.761,3136.466,"What you see is that step, existing steps coming down.",73,,
569,0.97,3136.466,3140.57,Once you get right at that corner you have this feeling of opening up.,73,,
570,0.97,3140.57,3144.474,The concept from the community was that it creates this welcome map.,73,,
571,0.97,3144.474,3144.808,This landing.,73,,
572,0.97,3144.808,3147.511,There's never going to be a massive amount of events here.,73,,
573,0.97,3147.511,3150.78,It's not the place where a lot of people are intended to come.,73,,
574,0.97,3150.78,3158.688,To have a space that feels enclosed that feels welcoming that feels like you can take a break and pause.,73,,
575,0.97,3158.688,3164.594,Then some of those other photos.,73,,
576,0.97,3164.594,3175.372,So this slide we wanted to include to show just pedestrian connections around that area.,74,,
577,0.97,3175.372,3184.08,"Right now it is, this portion of unopened right of way in East Howell looks like a parking lot.",74,,
578,0.97,3184.08,3205.535,If Council APPROVES this there will be a direct connection from Fairview up through capital Hill.,74,,
579,0.97,3205.535,3208.838,Areas where there's protected bike lanes.,74,,
580,0.97,3208.838,3218.915,This was showing some of the existing connections and how this enhances that connection.,74,,
581,0.97,3218.915,3221.651,Next slide.,74,,
582,0.97,3221.651,3230.26,So just to wrap things up as far as presentation looking for Council's conceptual approval of this.,74,,
583,0.97,3230.26,3238.768,If the resolution is adopted by Council we will prepare the ordinance and put all the requirements in that.,74,,
584,0.97,3238.768,3246.643,If Council grants the ordinance the permit will be in place for 15 years.,74,,
585,0.97,3246.643,3251.381,That's the end of the presentation.,74,,
586,0.97,3251.381,3261.791,I want to commend you on the work you've done with the community Sdot and the Department neighborhoods.,75,,
587,0.97,3261.791,3264.961,I'm supportive of this project.,75,,
588,0.97,3264.961,3265.462,Councilmember Morales.,75,,
589,0.97,3265.462,3265.695,Please.,75,,
590,0.97,3265.695,3266.062,Thank you.,76,,
591,0.97,3266.062,3278.708,I wonder if we could go back to slide 10. I apologize.,76,,
592,0.97,3278.708,3279.309,This is small.,76,,
593,0.97,3279.309,3280.21,I can't see everything.,76,,
594,0.97,3280.21,3283.613,I think a previous slide too we might go back to.,76,,
595,0.97,3283.613,3296.693,To one of the things I'm trying to understand better is what accommodations there are for people with mobility issues.,76,,
596,0.97,3296.693,3301.831,I understand this is a stair.,76,,
597,0.97,3301.831,3305.935,If there is accommodation for those with mobility issues.,76,,
598,0.97,3305.935,3308.238,Looking at this map and one of the photos.,76,,
599,0.97,3308.238,3313.543,", it's not clear to me how somebody, what the connection is to the Lake.",76,,
600,0.97,3313.543,3321.951,There was a photo that showed sort of the frontage and doesn't look like there's a crosswalk.,76,,
601,0.97,3321.951,3332.062,So can you talk about how people might actually cross Fairview to get to the Lake?,76,,
602,0.97,3332.062,3336.966,"Yeah, the site plan might be a better one if we want to go back two slides.",77,,
603,0.97,3336.966,3341.471,Let me address the Ada accessibility.,77,,
604,0.97,3341.471,3342.372,It is a stair climb.,77,,
605,0.97,3342.372,3358.221,Getting Ada access up and down the stairs is part of like multiple developments that have gone through to replace and actually get the stair actually didn't exist before the development up on the above along Eastlake.,77,,
606,0.97,3358.221,3365.095,So this has kind of been a long term connection for the community in each kind of piece has been built along the way.,77,,
607,0.97,3365.095,3376.773,What was important to our community though is I talked about having that slightly elevated view once you get up even like three feet a little bit around that range you can have just enough height to see the water.,77,,
608,0.97,3376.773,3379.743,As you come around that corner you can see downtown.,77,,
609,0.97,3379.743,3388.051,So there's a little bit of a larger space just above the main Plaza.,77,,
610,0.97,3388.051,3394.29,There's a bench set intentionally and the orientation of this Plaza so you can sit on that bench.,77,,
611,0.97,3394.29,3396.76,You have accessible seating adjacent as well.,77,,
612,0.97,3396.76,3399.462,Just to take in that view of downtown on the Lake.,77,,
613,0.97,3399.462,3407.003,What we did in order to accommodate that is we do provide an Ada accessible route.,77,,
614,0.97,3407.003,3407.537,It's less than 5%.,77,,
615,0.97,3407.537,3409.339,It's a gradual slope up.,77,,
616,0.97,3409.339,3414.644,So it was important that that overlook was Ada accessible.,77,,
617,0.97,3414.644,3418.548,From that point you really are at the base of the hill climb.,77,,
618,0.97,3418.548,3423.787,To get from up to Eastlake you have to use the street system and go around.,77,,
619,0.97,3423.787,3427.19,So that covers the accessibility side of things.,77,,
620,0.97,3427.19,3437.867,"The crosswalk itself, so part of the master plan does show a crosswalk and the intent from the community would love to see a crosswalk in this location.",77,,
621,0.97,3437.867,3443.473,We Conceptualized where it potentially could go.,77,,
622,0.97,3443.473,3450.213,We even submitted for Sdot potential grant to help the community design and figure out and build that crosswalk.,77,,
623,0.97,3450.213,3458.221,In further conversations with Sdot we're on a large curve.,77,,
624,0.97,3458.221,3459.923,So there is sight distances.,77,,
625,0.97,3459.923,3464.46,"We did talk with Seattle design Commission as well, that was a comment they brought up.",77,,
626,0.97,3464.46,3471.467,There is two Crosswalks about a couple hundred feet on either side that are existing to be used.,77,,
627,0.97,3471.467,3488.017,Ultimately Sdot once this is built and we see how it's used and if the programming is significant enough and the community starts to use it more and more whether or not it warrant as crosswalk and a design process associated with really where's the best place to put that crosswalk.,77,,
628,0.97,3488.017,3499.095,It remains an important component from a larger master plan perspective but there's a lot of challenges with the existing roadway configuration with Sdot to see how that could be implemented.,77,,
629,0.97,3499.095,3504.234,It's not part of this current project.,77,,
630,0.97,3504.234,3504.501,Okay.,78,,
631,0.97,3504.501,3504.801,Thank you.,78,,
632,0.97,3504.801,3510.94,And then just one more question sort of reflecting again on what Councilmember Strauss was saying.,78,,
633,0.97,3510.94,3515.712,It looks to me like the frontage might be 30 feet or so.,78,,
634,0.97,3515.712,3519.115,I'm not great at estimating this.,78,,
635,0.97,3519.115,3524.187,But a fairly small Sliver between what is very obviously office buildings.,78,,
636,0.97,3524.187,3540.236,"So I just want to hear a little bit more again about how we will ensure that people are aware that this is public space that this is, you know, the public is welcome to come in and use this space.",78,,
637,0.97,3540.236,3558.621,"Because just looking at some of the photos even if it's, you know, Greened up it still would look to me based on my ability to visualize, like, you know, sort of a green strip between two private parking lots.",78,,
638,0.97,3558.621,3569.132,So just want to hear a little bit more about the public facing nature of what this would look like.,78,,
639,0.97,3569.132,3576.673,Maybe that first slide with the title slide gives good perspective of what the end view could look like.,79,,
640,0.97,3576.673,3580.81,You have the title in the middle so you can visualize if it wasn't there.,79,,
641,0.97,3580.81,3587.884,So some of the things we've done is I think just in the shape and the form of the of the design.,79,,
642,0.97,3587.884,3588.318,Making it welcome.,79,,
643,0.97,3588.318,3590.687,Making it open.,79,,
644,0.97,3590.687,3592.322,What's not terribly clear here.,79,,
645,0.97,3592.322,3595.425,There's actually the adjacent property has a green space next to it.,79,,
646,0.97,3595.425,3601.998,As soon as you hit between those two properties you'll see a different in the urban framework.,79,,
647,0.97,3601.998,3607.67,Just the amount of green you have in this area.,79,,
648,0.97,3607.67,3609.439,Integrating a lot of seating.,79,,
649,0.97,3609.439,3616.212,Kind of inviting people in for the seating.,79,,
650,0.97,3616.212,3625.188,Being able to see the hill climb are components to use the urban elements to reinforce this is a space and that it's a welcoming space.,79,,
651,0.97,3625.188,3632.428,As I did mention there is some discussion with Sdot.,79,,
652,0.97,3632.428,3634.831,Do we want to assign something.,79,,
653,0.97,3634.831,3641.137,From a vehicular standpoint to know there's public parking.,79,,
654,0.97,3641.137,3643.239,Potentially also from a standpoint.,79,,
655,0.97,3643.239,3648.978,We're looking to Sdot to help us determine if there's additional Signage that might be needed.,79,,
656,0.97,3648.978,3658.688,To Hill climb this direction or whatever other kind of way finding might be needed.,79,,
657,0.97,3658.688,3665.461,My last question is and this is just my fundamental position on these issues.,80,,
658,0.97,3665.461,3670.166,I'm trying to have an open mind here.,80,,
659,0.97,3670.166,3681.411,"Having a hard time understanding why it's necessary to convert what is publicly owned land into private spaces if there's, we're not really, like the parking is still there.",80,,
660,0.97,3681.411,3683.846,"There's, you know, it's still accessible.",80,,
661,0.97,3683.846,3692.922,It's not clear to me why it needs to become privately owned.,80,,
662,0.97,3692.922,3702.098,I think Councilmember I would respond to that and note that the permit doesn't convert the right of way to private property.,81,,
663,0.97,3702.098,3708.438,It's only through the vacation process that a developer actually ACQUIRES the public interest in right of way.,81,,
664,0.97,3708.438,3714.844,The term permit gives them permission from the city for this use for a period of time.,81,,
665,0.97,3714.844,3721.217,And this term permit accommodates this use and this plan for 15 years.,81,,
666,0.97,3721.217,3722.585,All term permits are Revocable.,81,,
667,0.97,3722.585,3732.061,We use the longer term when we see there's more of an investment as someone's doing a utility tunnel underneath an alley.,81,,
668,0.97,3732.061,3741.637,If this is this private use of public right of way as Detyped in the ordinance for the term period that the city council accommodates.,81,,
669,0.97,3741.637,3749.479,And after that Itremains public right of way and the permit could be revoked.,81,,
670,0.97,3749.479,3755.952,"You know, but this just sets a use for the period and the conditions and the term.",81,,
671,0.97,3755.952,3763.359,The only thing I would add to that is the community process in 2014.,82,,
672,0.97,3763.359,3775.104,Has worked with a lot of volunteer hours and the grants from the Department of neighborhoods in order to fund the master plan the community process and the design to date.,82,,
673,0.97,3775.104,3783.646,"That totals I think to a little over 200,000 that they received through the grants and matching those grant dollars with volunteer hours.",82,,
674,0.97,3783.646,3789.352,"One of the things that was a big concern during the community process, well how will this be maintained?",82,,
675,0.97,3789.352,3792.088,How is it going to get built?,82,,
676,0.97,3792.088,3812.708,What we heard when we had that last open house after the partnership was developed and the Mou terms and the final site plans addressed was just the benefit of being able to have the adjacent property to have it built and built so quickly so it's open and usable to the public.,82,,
677,0.97,3812.708,3817.18,Almost more importantly in a lot of those community discussions of the the long term maintenance.,82,,
678,0.97,3817.18,3835.131,Not just the funding of the construction but taking ownership of that long term maintenance.,82,,
679,0.97,3835.131,3838.734,All of those spaces are open as well.,82,,
680,0.97,3838.734,3840.57,Thank you.,83,,
681,0.97,3840.57,3840.97,Thank you.,84,,
682,0.97,3840.97,3841.571,Councilmember Herbold.,84,,
683,0.97,3841.571,3844.04,Did I see your hands up?,84,,
684,0.97,3844.04,3845.708,Yeah.,85,,
685,0.97,3845.708,3846.876,Go ahead.,86,,
686,0.97,3846.876,3848.578,Thank you.,87,,
687,0.97,3848.578,3856.452,So appreciate the underscoring that the term permit is for 15 years.,87,,
688,0.97,3856.452,3866.862,My interest in these kinds of arrangements is trying to understand sort of what the back of the envelope math is.,87,,
689,0.97,3866.862,3872.235,You've heard me ask this question before when we talk about Street vacations and the like.,87,,
690,0.97,3872.235,3883.312,What back of the envelope math is about the value of the public benefit versus what we're giving up.,87,,
691,0.97,3883.312,3909.005,"Presume apply there's been some sort of calculation that the $500,000 plus the cost to maintain the public space it, that that is the value of these parking spaces being given up during the day for a period of 15 years.",87,,
692,0.97,3909.005,3909.438,Is that correct?,87,,
693,0.97,3909.438,3915.344,"That there's been some sort of a calculation done that that is, that constitutes the value.",87,,
694,0.97,3915.344,3921.117,The land itself for the public Plaza is public right of way.,87,,
695,0.97,3921.117,3923.085,They're not contributing the land.,87,,
696,0.97,3923.085,3932.662,They're contributing the cost to build the Plaza and the cost associated with the regular maintenance of the Plaza.,87,,
697,0.97,3932.662,3938.1,I would say we haven't done a mathematical calculation.,88,,
698,0.97,3938.1,3950.413,I think for looking at the term permit as an implementation tool that what we were responding to is that the community had identified that this was an appropriate balance that they supported.,88,,
699,0.97,3950.413,3962.358,So this kind of odd tucked away right of way that was used by the adjacent business for business parking.,88,,
700,0.97,3962.358,3977.106,That they balance that with Department and neighborhood planning money and the ability to have the developer do the work and the implementation and then the on going maintenance and work for community events.,88,,
701,0.97,3977.106,3989.051,More a balance of the community finding disagreement and the them achieve a very long help standing goal of that connection and more public use of the space.,88,,
702,0.97,3989.051,4013.642,It is a little bit an unusual circumstance but it was the balance we heard was that the community supported this and the business obviously feels like they're getting in enough out of it because they're willing to pay for the development of this and work with us on Signage and design and do the on going maintenance and term permit fees and insurance.,88,,
703,0.97,4013.642,4022.785,So we hope it's the right balance and that's what we are bringing forward is that community voice that they're supportive of the balance.,88,,
704,0.97,4022.785,4038.968,"I just want to say, again, I always feel that these public benefits should obviously consider and be centered on the goals of the community.",89,,
705,0.97,4038.968,4047.543,"But they should also include an assessment of the value of what the public, in this case real estate is.",89,,
706,0.97,4047.543,4052.548,And that that should also be part of the balance.,89,,
707,0.97,4052.548,4068.564,"Do we know, are there going to be any sort of restrictions on the ability of the private entity of Bsop 1, LLC to make money from these spaces?",89,,
708,0.97,4068.564,4074.203,They wouldn't have any means to do that.,90,,
709,0.97,4074.203,4082.111,So they will have their business daytime parking set aside and other than that they can't charge parking fees.,90,,
710,0.97,4082.111,4089.385,I mean I think a lot of people who get parking from their employer have to pay for it.,91,,
711,0.97,4089.385,4093.656,"I just want to, that's what I'm asking about.",91,,
712,0.97,4093.656,4099.128,I don't know the answer to that.,92,,
713,0.97,4099.128,4107.036,Perhaps Ian does or we might have to check with him and get back to you on that.,92,,
714,0.97,4107.036,4109.238,Thank you.,93,,
715,0.97,4109.238,4112.975,Last question relates to the maintenance of the public space.,93,,
716,0.97,4112.975,4128.491,"Does the maintenance of the public space extend to things like, you know, special events permits and that sort of thing that people want to have a gathering.",93,,
717,0.97,4128.491,4144.473,Or is that going to be within the per view as I believe it should be of the city and the special events committee or are we delegating the authority to booking this public space to the private entity?,93,,
718,0.97,4144.473,4155.184,"Um, I think in terms of if you're thinking of like advertising and cleanup and setup of tents and such that would Bea part of the special event planning.",94,,
719,0.97,4155.184,4164.56,So when some organization came in and said we want to do a poetry reading we need this and that that that's part of the obligation of the event planner.,94,,
720,0.97,4164.56,4172.835,There's nothing right now in the Mou that would impose an obligation on the property owner to clean up after an event.,94,,
721,0.97,4172.835,4186.715,"I think it's one of those that will be as they move forward, figuring out how the events are going to be planned that that's one of the things advertising cleanup, setup would be a part of that on going discussion.",94,,
722,0.97,4186.715,4194.623,I meant the decision making about whether or not to allow an event in this public space is the question I was asking.,95,,
723,0.97,4194.623,4194.924,No.,96,,
724,0.97,4194.924,4198.727,They don't get to Curate the events.,96,,
725,0.97,4198.727,4201.697,Thank you.,97,,
726,0.97,4201.697,4204.133,"Councilmember, if I may respond.",98,,
727,0.97,4204.133,4208.304,"Just for the read, Ian Morrison on behalf of the Bsop applicant.",98,,
728,0.97,4208.304,4216.579,There is no intention on behalf of the applicant to charge for parking of those stalls during the term permit period.,98,,
729,0.97,4216.579,4219.949,It's not the applicant's intention nor desire to be the curator of events.,98,,
730,0.97,4219.949,4240.502,"We would want to work with Sdot to ask if there is an event that maybe there's an additional liability rider that benefits us if there's some sort of incident on that, but Besides that we would look to Sdot to program that public space just like it would with the normal Street use permit or festival permit.",98,,
731,0.97,4240.502,4241.237,Thank you.,99,,
732,0.97,4241.237,4241.737,This is Julia.,100,,
733,0.97,4241.737,4250.079,I do have one you asked for the numbers and the back of napkin numbers as Amy mentioned.,100,,
734,0.97,4250.079,4258.754,We don't have dollars necessarily associated but from a in your opinions standpoint the public Plaza is about 5000 square feet.,100,,
735,0.97,4258.754,4267.796,We have to include provide allocation for emergency access around the building in any design.,100,,
736,0.97,4267.796,4273.602,If you don't include that circulation that would be required no matter.,100,,
737,0.97,4273.602,4279.642,The term permit stalls being contemplated total about 2000 square feet.,100,,
738,0.97,4279.642,4283.879,The numbers we do have available if that helps.,100,,
739,0.97,4283.879,4284.58,That's very helpful.,101,,
740,0.97,4284.58,4284.88,Thank you.,101,,
741,0.97,4284.88,4289.818,Thanks for all the questions.,102,,
742,0.97,4289.818,4298.027,I appreciate Lish pointing out in his memo what the Seattle municipal code has us look at when evaluating these projects as well.,102,,
743,0.97,4298.027,4304.5,I want to thank the community leaders who have been working on this for years.,102,,
744,0.97,4304.5,4317.98,"Department of neighborhoods, Sdot for creating this, enabling us to create this public Plaza that somebody else will pay the operations and maintenance for which is I think a great benefit to the community.",102,,
745,0.97,4317.98,4330.526,"So if there are no further questions on this, the resolution I'd like to move that the committee recommend approval of resolution 31988 which is item 2 on our agenda.",102,,
746,0.97,4330.526,4332.161,Is there a second?,102,,

776,0.97,4400.496,4417.78,"An ordinance relating to the city's 2021 budget amending ordinance 126237, which adopted the 2021 budget, including the 2021-2026 capital improvement program.",121,,

780,0.97,4426.455,4434.496,We also received an E-mail from the transit advisory board Cochair in support of this.,122,,
781,0.97,4434.496,4438.567,I know Sdot has done a lot of work putting this together.,122,,
782,0.97,4438.567,4448.076,One time Reserve funding left over from the 2014 transportation benefit district.,122,,
783,0.97,4448.076,4452.981,This proposal was announced by the executive on February 1ST.,122,,
784,0.97,4452.981,4461.523,The plan recently secured the board which oversees spending.,122,,

787,0.97,4467.763,4470.432,"Calvin, did you want to start off?",122,,
788,0.97,4470.432,4475.604,I think we should go through the presentation and I'll be available to answer questions if they come up.,123,,
789,0.97,4475.604,4476.471,Okay.,124,,

793,0.97,4485.848,4494.389,We're going to pull this presentation up in a moment.,125,,
794,0.97,4494.389,4502.698,I am Candida Lorenzana and here with me is Domenico Martinucci.,125,,
795,0.97,4502.698,4509.338,We're here to talk about STBD and as it relates to.,125,,
796,0.97,4509.338,4513.742,In our conversation we're going to hit on implementation Timeline.,125,,
797,0.97,4513.742,4517.279,There's a lot going on with STBD typically.,125,,
798,0.97,4517.279,4519.715,Level set of where we are.,125,,
799,0.97,4519.715,4525.12,The background of behind the revenues and the $60 vehicle license fee.,125,,
800,0.97,4525.12,4535.43,Our work with the transit advisory board on the proposal before you and discuss the proposed spend plan and project list with you.,125,,
801,0.97,4535.43,4541.27,Two weeks ago we were here to talk about the Metro and Sdot transit funding service agreement.,125,,
802,0.97,4541.27,4545.04,I appreciate the support this committee provided for that agreement.,125,,
803,0.97,4545.04,4549.077,"It passed in a minute, Pleasely at King County Council yesterday.",125,,
804,0.97,4549.077,4550.679,Sdot is going to begin moving that forward.,125,,
805,0.97,4550.679,4555.784,Thank you for your work on that.,125,,
806,0.97,4555.784,4562.391,Today we're here to talk about this budget legislation to spend STBD reserves.,125,,
807,0.97,4562.391,4576.538,Sdot is continuing its work on a spend plan proposal for the Vlf that was approved through the budget process that will come before you around the beginning of April.,125,,
808,0.97,4576.538,4576.838,Next slide.,125,,
809,0.97,4576.838,4581.276,So this provides an overview of the various resources involved.,125,,
810,0.97,4581.276,4583.912,Essentially there are four buckets.,125,,
811,0.97,4583.912,4590.052,The first is a 2010 $20 Vlf which continues indefinitely.,125,,
812,0.97,4590.052,4600.729,There is the voter approved 2014 measure which expired at the end of 2020 and was funded by a .1% sales tax and a $60 Vlf.,125,,
813,0.97,4600.729,4609.538,There's the new measure which was passed last year and expires in 2027 that is a .15% sales tax.,125,,
814,0.97,4609.538,4616.511,Funds a program attic extension of many other programs.,125,,
815,0.97,4616.511,4623.852,Lastly there is a additional Council Vlf that Council passed that would continue indefinitely.,125,,
816,0.97,4623.852,4633.962,We basically have a mix of vote Aeroapproved resources when it comes to Seattle transportation benefit district.,125,,
817,0.97,4633.962,4638.667,Next slide.,125,,
818,0.97,4638.667,4642.738,So little bit of history here.,125,,
819,0.97,4642.738,4649.277,The $60 Vlf was impacted by the Patsage of I 976.,125,,
820,0.97,4649.277,4658.687,Removed the ability of the city and Tbd statewide to collect vehicle license fee.,125,,
821,0.97,4658.687,4659.755,This measure passed statewide.,125,,
822,0.97,4659.755,4674.136,City of Seattle voters actually voted it down city of Seattle challenged the initiative.,125,,
823,0.97,4674.136,4680.509,An injunction allowed us to continue to collect the $60 Vlf funds.,125,,
824,0.97,4680.509,4682.711,So we set those aside.,125,,
825,0.97,4682.711,4686.581,If a legal challenge was unsuccessful.,125,,
826,0.97,4686.581,4695.991,October of last year the Washington state Supreme Court struck down I-976 making the Reserve funds available.,125,,
827,0.97,4695.991,4703.632,I'm going to hand it off to NICO.,125,,
828,0.97,4703.632,4703.999,Thank you.,126,,
829,0.97,4703.999,4707.002,Thanks for having us here today.,126,,
830,0.97,4707.002,4719.981,So immediately following the Supreme Court's decision we began to engage the transit advisory board and oversight Committee on a proposed proposal for programming these recently restored funds.,126,,
831,0.97,4719.981,4728.924,The transit advisory board is the oversight body for the benefit district proposition one.,126,,
832,0.97,4728.924,4734.763,Although the oversight committee typically oversees spending of levy funds.,126,,
833,0.97,4734.763,4743.038,Our process here coincided with the Covid-19.,126,,
834,0.97,4743.038,4749.945,That recommended reduction or Pausing of many different projects that were levy delivery over the next couple of years.,126,,
835,0.97,4749.945,4754.716,We saw a natural fit to begin with restoring projects within that list.,126,,
836,0.97,4754.716,4759.688,That fit within the criteria we heard.,126,,
837,0.97,4759.688,4760.555,In terms of those criteria.,126,,
838,0.97,4760.555,4767.762,We heard loud and clear as some of you heard in public comment today.,126,,
839,0.97,4767.762,4768.497,As was Innumerated yesterday.,126,,
840,0.97,4768.497,4777.806,We heard a real strong interest in focusing on restoring transit projects and otherwise those with a clear transit nexus.,126,,
841,0.97,4777.806,4786.648,More generally to maintain the voter approved measure under which these funds were initially collected.,126,,
842,0.97,4786.648,4795.924,"Just to reiterate as you saw yesterday, supportive of the proposed plan we have in front of you today.",126,,
843,0.97,4795.924,4797.526,Let's dive into that proposal.,126,,
844,0.97,4797.526,4800.228,It's broken into three parts.,126,,
845,0.97,4800.228,4803.832,"Project restoration, transit service and strategic reserves.",126,,
846,0.97,4803.832,4807.202,We'll talk more in depth about project restoration.,126,,
847,0.97,4807.202,4814.576,On this slide I want to talk about the other items.,126,,
848,0.97,4814.576,4820.549,The new proposition one approved in November does not begin revenue collection until April of this year.,126,,
849,0.97,4820.549,4827.455,We are in a three month lull between the end of the last measure.,126,,
850,0.97,4827.455,4831.493,We are continuing to fund transit service on the road today.,126,,
851,0.97,4831.493,4835.03,Transit service that was initially added during the 2014 pop proposition one.,126,,
852,0.97,4835.03,4842.237,We have an on going commitment to fund into the future and into the new proposition one.,126,,
853,0.97,4842.237,4844.94,So this $5 million allocation helps fill that funding gap.,126,,
854,0.97,4844.94,4854.216,Helps us deliver on those commitments even while we are not collecting revenue.,126,,
855,0.97,4854.216,4857.485,The $6 million in stray 22 jig reserves.,126,,
856,0.97,4857.485,4874.836,We eat aside during the proposition 1. having those funds on hand going into the overlapping uncertainties of 2020 was really critical in allowing us to continue to deliver all of those services that we deliver through the Seattle transportation district proposition one.,126,,
857,0.97,4874.836,4881.61,So with these lessons in mind we are hoping to set aside additional Reserve funding over the life of the program.,126,,
858,0.97,4881.61,4886.214,The $6 million would be a seed that would grow as we set aside more every year.,126,,
859,0.97,4886.214,4900.662,This would allow us to not only account for any swings in revenue collection but at the end of the program help us ramp down over a longer period of time.,126,,
860,0.97,4900.662,4900.962,Next slide.,126,,
861,0.97,4900.962,4909.638,Before we get into project restoration I wanted to show what these two allocations look like in the context of our overall plan.,126,,
862,0.97,4909.638,4915.377,The 2021 bar as we tried to highlight the bottom just represents April through December.,126,,
863,0.97,4915.377,4919.447,Nearing that period of revenue collection for the new proposition one.,126,,
864,0.97,4919.447,4924.92,The two boxes with the White asterisks represent these two allocations.,126,,
865,0.97,4924.92,4929.758,5Million for transit service and 6 million for reserve funds.,126,,
866,0.97,4929.758,4934.329,For transit service having light slightly taller bar.,126,,
867,0.97,4934.329,4938.733,Representsonly three quarters of transit service spending.,126,,
868,0.97,4938.733,4943.738,Makes this year's transit expenditures look more like 2022.,126,,
869,0.97,4943.738,4947.976,Without that money we would be Underspending this year.,126,,
870,0.97,4947.976,4961.389,"Although it's not immediately apparent, having the $6 million reserve set aside in 2021 allows the reserve fund set aside which is represented by the smaller gray boxes.",126,,
871,0.97,4961.389,4965.36,Allows those set asides to be smaller essentially.,126,,
872,0.97,4965.36,4971.933,Those by virtue of those we're able to divert additional transit service throughout the life of the program.,126,,
873,0.97,4971.933,4972.4,"Next slide, please.",126,,
874,0.97,4972.4,4975.503,We do have some questions.,127,,
875,0.97,4975.503,4980.942,Is it okay if it we wait until the end of the presentation?,127,,
876,0.97,4980.942,4984.512,They might get answered.,127,,
877,0.97,4984.512,4985.213,"Okay, thank you.",127,,
878,0.97,4985.213,4986.381,Thank you.,128,,
879,0.97,4986.381,4987.983,These are split across two slides.,128,,
880,0.97,4987.983,4994.222,I'm going to go through and give a brief overview of what each of these lines represent.,128,,
881,0.97,4994.222,4999.194,"If there are more specific questions, we're happy to answer those.",128,,
882,0.97,4999.194,5004.499,Happy to provide Followup information if it there's something we don't have on hand.,128,,
883,0.97,5004.499,5006.801,The first item is two projects.,128,,
884,0.97,5006.801,5013.007,These were planned for delivery under our transit spot improvement program.,128,,
885,0.97,5013.007,5015.844,One is on Gillman Avenue.,128,,
886,0.97,5015.844,5024.919,Safety improvements improving pedestrian connections and sidewalk conditions as well as improving bus bike interaction along the corridor.,128,,
887,0.97,5024.919,5030.725,Second Prong is a bus stop improvement and expansion.,128,,
888,0.97,5030.725,5039.601,This is a very high volume stop that routinely serves two coaches at the same time.,128,,
889,0.97,5039.601,5039.868,Okay.,129,,
890,0.97,5039.868,5046.374,This project in addition to a bunch of improvements.,130,,
891,0.97,5046.374,5050.545,Other improvements will largely increase that capacity.,130,,
892,0.97,5050.545,5053.648,Safely and comfortably serve as stops.,130,,
893,0.97,5053.648,5060.922,The second item on this slide is a Programattic allocation for the transit spot.,130,,
894,0.97,5060.922,5065.493,This is not tied directly to individual projects today.,130,,
895,0.97,5065.493,5069.564,What this does is fills a reduction made in future funding for the program.,130,,
896,0.97,5069.564,5079.774,So this allocation will ensure that the transit spot improvement program can continue to deliver many of the great projects they do.,130,,
897,0.97,5079.774,5090.285,"The transit spot improvement program will deliver the two projects just mentioned but generally delivers red bus lanes, rear door bus pads.",130,,
898,0.97,5090.285,5090.718,Stop improvements.,130,,
899,0.97,5090.718,5091.119,Signal upgrades.,130,,
900,0.97,5091.119,5096.691,Anything that could benefit transit on the program.,130,,
901,0.97,5096.691,5111.739,Final item is on allocation for the route 40 transit plus mobile corridor project which is here to fill an expected gap in grant funding for the program.,130,,
902,0.97,5111.739,5122.684,This really helps the route 40 project stay on schedule which we'll see design completion in 2022 and delivery in 2023.,130,,
903,0.97,5122.684,5123.184,Selection slide please.,130,,
904,0.97,5123.184,5131.626,Top of the slide here is a small allocation for Ppmc.,130,,
905,0.97,5131.626,5141.536,This will help fund a gap in the Drp concept design which funds staff and technical resources to support the overall program.,130,,
906,0.97,5141.536,5146.074,Similar to the route 40 allocation.,130,,
907,0.97,5146.074,5149.844,Helping to keep the program.,130,,
908,0.97,5149.844,5157.418,Second is a funding restoration for 16th Avenue Northwest and northwest market Street signal improvement.,130,,
909,0.97,5157.418,5162.157,Which will Hecht support transit signal priority enhancements.,130,,
910,0.97,5162.157,5173.401,The two worth mentioning are the route 44 and the rapid rise line which are two of our high frequency and Ridership routes.,130,,
911,0.97,5173.401,5185.079,A large allocation for the 23rd Avenue phase three budget.,130,,
912,0.97,5185.079,5192.72,"Including crossing improvements, some minor Taping maintenance.",130,,
913,0.97,5192.72,5193.188,Signal improvements.,130,,
914,0.97,5193.188,5200.061,Benefiting transit which has a difficult term.,130,,
915,0.97,5200.061,5210.238,"In total these six, really seven items add up to that $12.7 million allocation that I mentioned earlier.",130,,
916,0.97,5210.238,5215.81,With that I'm going to hand it back off.,130,,
917,0.97,5215.81,5220.582,So this is just a reminder of where we are today and when we're coming back.,131,,
918,0.97,5220.582,5225.253,So today this conversation is primarily discussion about this legislation.,131,,
919,0.97,5225.253,5233.761,And looking to come back to the committee beginning of April with a $20 Vlf spending plan.,131,,
920,0.97,5233.761,5234.829,With that concludes our presentation.,131,,
921,0.97,5234.829,5244.672,And happy to answer any questions.,131,,
922,0.97,5244.672,5245.239,Thank you.,132,,
923,0.97,5245.239,5250.111,"Councilmember Strauss has questions, as does Councilmember Herbold.",132,,
924,0.97,5250.111,5262.39,Councilmember.,132,,
925,0.97,5262.39,5265.193,Thank you.,133,,
926,0.97,5265.193,5266.995,Great to hear.,133,,
927,0.97,5266.995,5268.997,"Candida, great presentations today.",133,,
928,0.97,5268.997,5275.103,"My questions are on nine, ten, and the last slide.",133,,
929,0.97,5275.103,5280.508,This is the transit spot improvement program.,133,,
930,0.97,5280.508,5287.315,My questions are a shared priority.,133,,
931,0.97,5287.315,5299.227,"Route 44, spot improvements were created and we understand in the last budget cycle that the dollars, council Backfilled what had been transportation funded projects.",133,,
932,0.97,5299.227,5300.728,We backed it with the general fund.,133,,
933,0.97,5300.728,5315.643,Can you speak to the ability for us to use the 976 money to fund transportation projects so that we can free up general funds to use on many other important needs that the city funds the general fund?,133,,
934,0.97,5315.643,5329.557,"In addition to that, I'll just speak to market are other projects that received reduced funding.",133,,
935,0.97,5329.557,5337.031,Can you speak about restoring funding to those spots?,133,,
936,0.97,5337.031,5337.899,Thank you.,133,,
937,0.97,5337.899,5340.068,"Can I take that one, Candida?",134,,
938,0.97,5340.068,5345.373,I wasn't sure if Cal had something to add.,135,,
939,0.97,5345.373,5345.84,Thank you.,136,,
940,0.97,5345.84,5347.775,"If I can just start then, I guess.",136,,
941,0.97,5347.775,5358.753,The first thing I want to highlight is that these funds are reserves of proposition Wund funds.,136,,
942,0.97,5358.753,5366.127,It has to be used for transit under what the voters approved when they first gave us the money.,136,,
943,0.97,5366.127,5384.345,"There is, it could not be used for some of the other transportation related projects that did not support improved transit speed Reliability and capacity.",136,,
944,0.97,5384.345,5398.092,"I think, to the extent there are other general funds or other revenues in the Sdot budget that support those types of projects, this type of funding could displace those general funds.",136,,
945,0.97,5398.092,5401.662,I'll also add a little bit.,137,,
946,0.97,5401.662,5404.932,I think that this is really a question of timing.,137,,
947,0.97,5404.932,5419.113,"The 2021 budget process was something that we had in our minds and in consideration and appreciate Council's action to restore both the route 44, the route 7, and there is one more.",137,,
948,0.97,5419.113,5420.148,I'm sorry.,137,,
949,0.97,5420.148,5420.848,I'm forgetting it.,137,,
950,0.97,5420.848,5431.959,"Very much appreciate that, but at the point in which we knew that the funds were available, there were a lot of uncertainties and factors to consider.",137,,
951,0.97,5431.959,5437.198,"Our conversation with tab, frankly, happened towards the end through November and December.",137,,
952,0.97,5437.198,5444.305,"With that knowledge, and them understanding with the knowledge that those projects were restored by Council.",137,,
953,0.97,5444.305,5463.224,"I think the other factor here, too, is after understanding that 976 had been overturned, we had the ballot measure on the ballot and had that failed, the funds would not necessarily be available for any projects but instead would have to be used to help us ramp down service levels.",137,,
954,0.97,5463.224,5472.667,"If I could also, I just took a quick look to see what the source of funding is for some of those, the route 7, the route 44.",138,,
955,0.97,5472.667,5475.236,It was real estate excise task that was used.,138,,
956,0.97,5475.236,5483.744,It was not general fund that they used to support the projects.,138,,
957,0.97,5483.744,5484.612,Helpful clarification.,139,,
958,0.97,5484.612,5490.451,"The question still stands, route 44 specifically is transportation or transit, related.",139,,
959,0.97,5490.451,5497.391,"Are we able to free up the dollars for other uses or Cal, am I out of my Lane here?",139,,
960,0.97,5497.391,5503.531,"Councilmember, I think the funding would be eligible for the route 44 project.",140,,
961,0.97,5503.531,5514.242,"There is, in 2021, 500,000 real estate excise tax in the project that could be shifted.",140,,
962,0.97,5514.242,5519.213,"Great, so I guess NICO or Candida, are those we can under take?",141,,
963,0.97,5519.213,5523.117,What do I need to do or are there other folks I need to speak with?,141,,
964,0.97,5523.117,5532.059,"If there is a desire to change the projects on the list, something would need to come off.",142,,
965,0.97,5532.059,5533.761,Especially if it relates to capital restoration.,142,,
966,0.97,5533.761,5549.977,"This has been well Vetted and supported by the levy over sight committee and transit advisory board and I think it would be important to, you know, make sure our stake holders have an understanding of any potential changes the Council may be interested in making.",142,,
967,0.97,5549.977,5550.745,Okay.,143,,
968,0.97,5550.745,5551.045,Thank you.,143,,
969,0.97,5551.045,5564.525,I guess I'll take the opportunity to say I'm glad we're getting route 44 funded even if it is not with the original funding source and let's get all of the projects going which brings me to slide ten.,143,,
970,0.97,5564.525,5569.063,"I probably already know the answer, I figure I would ask it Anyways.",143,,
971,0.97,5569.063,5587.214,"My assumption is that Madison Vrt does not fall under this, we're waiting on Federal funds Kchlt you confirm that $976 are not what we're waiting on to get Madison bus rapid transit running, that it is, in fact, the Federal Government.",143,,
972,0.97,5587.214,5587.748,You're correct.,144,,
973,0.97,5587.748,5588.883,Yup.,145,,
974,0.97,5588.883,5590.284,"Sorry, Cal.",146,,
975,0.97,5590.284,5591.118,That's it.,147,,
976,0.97,5591.118,5591.285,Yes.,147,,
977,0.97,5591.285,5591.619,You're right.,147,,
978,0.97,5591.619,5597.124,We're just waiting on the grant from the FTA.,147,,
979,0.97,5597.124,5598.025,All local funds have been secured.,147,,
980,0.97,5598.025,5599.927,Thank you for the good work on that.,148,,
981,0.97,5599.927,5603.898,"Last question for the questions page, how do we buy more transit?",148,,
982,0.97,5603.898,5606.634,How do we buy more service hours?,148,,
983,0.97,5606.634,5609.503,I want all of the service hours.,148,,
984,0.97,5609.503,5613.507,"Yeah, that is a great question.",149,,
985,0.97,5613.507,5622.216,"I'll say within the context of prop one, we are limited by the revenue that we are bringing in from the voter approved measure.",149,,
986,0.97,5622.216,5637.698,"Point you back to the spend plan, we're expecting to ram up the amount of service that we're purchasing under the program as we expect sales tax revenue to increase as the program matures.",149,,
987,0.97,5637.698,5641.936,Obviously sales tax is a fickle friend as we have learned on the down side of 2020.,149,,
988,0.97,5641.936,5642.803,It is very powerful.,149,,
989,0.97,5642.803,5662.556,"That can swing in the opposite direction as we saw in 2018 and 2019 and so if those projections or I should say, if revenue beats the projections, certainly we can direct as much of that additional revenue towards more transit service as the program continues.",149,,
990,0.97,5662.556,5663.457,Thank you so much.,150,,
991,0.97,5663.457,5664.692,Thank you.,150,,
992,0.97,5664.692,5666.46,Those are all of my questions.,150,,
993,0.97,5666.46,5666.827,Thank you.,151,,
994,0.97,5666.827,5675.136,"Councilmember Herbold, do you want to ask your questions now?",151,,
995,0.97,5675.136,5680.541,Other Councilmembers with questions.,151,,
996,0.97,5680.541,5685.846,It took me a minute to get off of mute.,152,,
997,0.97,5685.846,5714.809,"Looking at slide eight, and I understand that the slide captures not only the reserves that we're discussing today but funding under the plan that is yet to come to us, but as I understand it, even though it says April to December, April to December is really about when the new revenue is going to be available.",152,,
998,0.97,5714.809,5730.858,I have questions both as it relates to the $5 million in transit service that this action allocates as well as the new dollars that won't be collected until April.,152,,
999,0.97,5730.858,5753.514,I understand that because of the fact that Metro does service adjustments in March and September that this additional transit service is not going to be available until September.,152,,
1000,0.97,5753.514,5781.675,"That really concerns me because as it relates, if you take a look, for instance, just as one example and this is one example that is top of mind for me, the emerging needs category for West Seattle and Covid recovery is a fairly small Sliver of dollars for 2021 as compared to 2022.",152,,
1001,0.97,5781.675,5790.718,I think our greatest needs around the West Seattle bridge closure are going to be coming later this year before September.,152,,
1002,0.97,5790.718,5819.68,"I say before September in light of the fact that, you know, president Biden announced yesterday that all adults will have shots in their arms by the end of May, so that is going to be Impacting when people are working less from home and commuting more and relying on service, transit service more.",152,,
1003,0.97,5819.68,5827.922,"I'm just wondering, is there any flexibility at all to add service sooner than September?",152,,
1004,0.97,5827.922,5836.33,That is a great question and I think something that is top of mind for us as well.,153,,
1005,0.97,5836.33,5857.484,"Briefly we're planning on making a sizable investment in September which will--although it comes later than we hope it will allow us to add more than we otherwise would have because we'll be funding for a shorter period of time, hence the slightly larger allocation in 2022.",153,,
1006,0.97,5857.484,5864.925,I'll remind Metrobuss are still operating at 20% capacity at an artificial limit.,153,,
1007,0.97,5864.925,5873.367,Metro is in an internal process to determine what is the right timing as we're beginning to lift the restrictions are.,153,,
1008,0.97,5873.367,5885.746,We expect that those capacity restrictions lifting over some period of time will be probably the primary factor in absorbing a lot of that returning demand to the system.,153,,
1009,0.97,5885.746,5897.458,"Obviously we know that Precovid, the buses, especially a lot of the peak routes were full in the morning, full in the afternoons coming home.",153,,
1010,0.97,5897.458,5920.281,"I think we're anticipating and obviously this will depend on a lot of factors but we're anticipating some continued work from home percentage, maybe higher than Precovid levels which I think will help to soften that return to work, the increase in demand as people return to work and return to jobs around the city.",153,,
1011,0.97,5920.281,5932.726,"While we may be reaching a pretty high vaccination rate by, say, early summer, late May, that I think there is some room to absorb that.",153,,
1012,0.97,5932.726,5937.264,I'll say on the Metro side as well.,153,,

1014,0.97,5938.732,5944.371,Hours that they set aside every service change to respond to unexpected demands in the system.,153,,
1015,0.97,5944.371,5973.4,"It is not an enormous amount but it is--it has proven to be an important tool that they have used in the past to address where sort of those crowding needs are the greatest and we fully expect that, if that is seen on West Seattle routes coming, that is a tool they will use to help draft that.",153,,
1016,0.97,5973.4,5978.005,Thank you.,154,,
1017,0.97,5978.005,5979.873,"Councilmembers, any other questions?",155,,

1049,0.97,6116.977,6133.594,"An ordinance related to surveillance technology implementation, authorizing approval of uses and accepting surveillance impact reports for the Seattle police Department's use of surveillance Technologies.",170,,
1050,0.97,6133.594,6134.862,For briefing and discussion.,170,,
1051,0.97,6134.862,6137.931,Thank you.,171,,
1052,0.97,6137.931,6152.446,"So we have several folks here, information technology Department and from the departments that have the existing Technologies for which we'll eventually approve surveillance, impact reports on.",171,,
1053,0.97,6152.446,6154.047,I have a short version introduction.,171,,
1054,0.97,6154.047,6162.89,I'll give the longer version to set the table and provide context for these presentations today.,171,,
1055,0.97,6162.89,6178.038,We had an over view presentation from our information technology Department a few weeks ago to lay out the lengthy process involved for approving surveillance impact reports.,171,,
1056,0.97,6178.038,6180.841,We have a lot of information to get into today.,171,,
1057,0.97,6180.841,6197.024,"We're breaking it into three pieces with each of the three departments getting its own Council bill, so I'll ask you to hold your questions until the end of each of the three presentations so you'll get at least three times to ask questions.",171,,
1058,0.97,6197.024,6199.96,"We will hear the presentations today, ask questions.",171,,
1059,0.97,6199.96,6207.968,We can vote on amendments and the ordinances on the next meeting.,171,,
1060,0.97,6207.968,6222.783,"To vote on amendments at the March 17th Committee, we want to have the amendments into central staff, lise Kaye, no later than today.",171,,
1061,0.97,6222.783,6231.558,"We have the reports to the introduction referral calendars approved last week, Monday, January 22nd, so we would have a little bit more time.",171,,
1062,0.97,6231.558,6237.397,"Again, we're not voting on these for two weeks from now.",171,,
1063,0.97,6237.397,6249.676,"Some background, surveillance, it is important to look at the Seattle municipal code and how surveillance is defined by 14.1A .010.",171,,
1064,0.97,6249.676,6265.492,2 is defined as Technologies that observe and analyze the movements and behavior and actions of identifiable individuals.,171,,
1065,0.97,6265.492,6266.493,That is an SMC.,171,,
1066,0.97,6266.493,6274.468,That is based on the so-called surveillance ordinance which was originally passed in 2017 and then amended in 2018.,171,,
1067,0.97,6274.468,6282.009,This definition of surveillance is important as we consider what we're trying to achieve in reviewing and approving the three ordinances.,171,,
1068,0.97,6282.009,6299.292,"If the discussion of the technology generates other policy matters not related to surveillance, then we may want to consider having a the relevant committees take up those Non-Surveillance policy items because we're focusing on the surveillance aspect today.",171,,
1069,0.97,6299.292,6307.534,I believe we should consider the trade offs when reviewing the existing Technologies already being used by the city government departments.,171,,
1070,0.97,6307.534,6314.307,Technology with the ability to conduct surveillance if misused or unaccountable is detrimental to liberty and privacy.,171,,
1071,0.97,6314.307,6329.923,"At the same time, any of the technologies, if used properly and with accountability enables city government to save money and improve efficiency and deliver services for the residents and businesses of our city.",171,,
1072,0.97,6329.923,6337.964,I want to thank Cara from our staff for working with the Seattle information technology Department.,171,,
1073,0.97,6337.964,6341.601,I want to thank Omari Stringer and ginger Armbruster.,171,,
1074,0.97,6341.601,6346.64,All of the departments that worked to put together the surveillance impact reports.,171,,
1075,0.97,6346.64,6358.385,One of the consistent suggestions from central staff is to have us potentially adopt the executive over views as part of the Council bills so that we capture the allowable purposes of the technology.,171,,
1076,0.97,6358.385,6365.292,That is a clear and immediate way to insert additional guard rails for how the technology is used.,171,,
1077,0.97,6365.292,6366.56,Very open to that approach.,171,,
1078,0.97,6366.56,6375.602,"At the ENOF the committee today, we may want to have central staff talk to us about what they recommend in terms of amendments.",171,,
1079,0.97,6375.602,6391.885,"It is also important to note that, I'm almost done here, it is almost important to note that we have an additional back stop for the use of the technologies and that is thanks to section 14.18.010 of the code.",171,,
1080,0.97,6391.885,6402.095,The section requires the office of Inspector General for public safety regarding police technology and our city auditor for all other departments to conduct annual reviews of the Technologies.,171,,
1081,0.97,6402.095,6407.567,So we may want to direct them to focus in on certain things that we're concerned about.,171,,
1082,0.97,6407.567,6424.818,The city of Seattle has one of the strongest surveillance ordinances in the country and I look forward to ensuring that the review process is conducted on the existing Technologies in a way that still enables us to deliver government services while balancing the need for privacy and protections.,171,,
1083,0.97,6424.818,6438.765,"Thank you for giving me the time have that over view and I would like to turn it over to our central staff analyst, lise Kaye, for any introductory remarks.",171,,
1084,0.97,6438.765,6442.936,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen, Lisa Gresci Kay on your central staff.",172,,
1085,0.97,6442.936,6443.737,You gave a thorough introduction.,172,,
1086,0.97,6443.737,6448.875,I don't have a lot more to add to that.,172,,
1087,0.97,6448.875,6462.289,"I think ginger and Omari will give an over view from the executive side, just prior to them, my walking through the various bill, the three bills, if that works for you, Councilmember.",172,,
1088,0.97,6462.289,6476.703,"Yes, so we'll get a presentation from information Technologies Department and then we'll get back to lise Kaye who will help set the table further on these complex reports.",173,,
1089,0.97,6476.703,6481.875,"Ginger and Omari, welcome, and others from Ibt.",173,,
1090,0.97,6481.875,6487.581,Omari will share his screen to show you the presentation.,174,,
1091,0.97,6487.581,6498.725,"Thank you, Council President, or Council committee President chair Pedersen, all of the members of the committee, and central staff, as well as all of the colleagues who worked on these surveillance impact reports.",174,,
1092,0.97,6498.725,6512.739,"I'll spend a few minutes providing a little more information about what our role is in I. T., how we pulled these together, what it takes to build one of these and some of the pieces and parts that have been delivered so you can understand better the context of what these are.",174,,
1093,0.97,6512.739,6517.244,"Omari, if you'll go to the next slide.",174,,
1094,0.97,6517.244,6525.118,When we last came to speak to you as Councilmember Pedersen mentioned it was on the 20th of January.,174,,
1095,0.97,6525.118,6528.288,We presented what is this to remind everybody of the work we'll get into this year.,174,,
1096,0.97,6528.288,6529.89,We presented an over view.,174,,
1097,0.97,6529.89,6534.728,I think most of you were attendance or the staff was there.,174,,
1098,0.97,6534.728,6537.163,Hopefully you got perspective on what we would talk about.,174,,
1099,0.97,6537.163,6538.765,We have had two things happen since then.,174,,
1100,0.97,6538.765,6546.573,A little more than two but the two we want to bring your attention is group two legislation submitted to Council.,174,,
1101,0.97,6546.573,6551.244,We'll work on the rest of the Technologies that will be before you the rest of the year.,174,,
1102,0.97,6551.244,6559.619,Group three has been transmitted to the city clerk and is going through the review process to be brought to you and this Committee in the future and reform calendar will have those dates.,174,,
1103,0.97,6559.619,6563.423,We continue to work on group four and this is just a place setter.,174,,
1104,0.97,6563.423,6568.962,We had talked to you back in January about the possibility of needing more time to complete the work.,174,,
1105,0.97,6568.962,6571.564,We will need more time to complete the work.,174,,
1106,0.97,6571.564,6576.136,They have come back for requests for more public engagement time and for them to do review.,174,,
1107,0.97,6576.136,6578.438,We're not prepared to talk about today.,174,,
1108,0.97,6578.438,6585.712,We have been working with Pedersen and staff around that request to make sure we're doing that appropriately understanding the due date was the first of this month.,174,,
1109,0.97,6585.712,6592.652,We're in conversation now and will be back to you with more information about that.,174,,
1110,0.97,6592.652,6592.852,Okay.,174,,
1111,0.97,6592.852,6593.42,"Next slide, please, Omari.",174,,
1112,0.97,6593.42,6598.825,Councilmember Pedersen did this so I don't have to read the definition but here is the definition one more time.,174,,
1113,0.97,6598.825,6613.073,There are exclusions around Technologies that already have other laws attached to them like body worn cameras and police vehicle camera area security cameras or technology that only monitors some employees.,174,,
1114,0.97,6613.073,6615.709,"If folks know this is happening, they can say no thank you.",174,,
1115,0.97,6615.709,6618.078,Not surveillance or by this definition of the law.,174,,
1116,0.97,6618.078,6625.485,The inclusions speak to the civil liberties impacts and use in any sharing of information that will lead us to include.,174,,
1117,0.97,6625.485,6634.728,"Pretty much, it is a surveillance technology, if it meets the definition, there are no Exclusions and a reasonable thought that the inclusions may apply.",174,,
1118,0.97,6634.728,6644.704,"That is what constituted the master list, we came up with 26 Technologies for your consideration.",174,,
1119,0.97,6644.704,6654.247,Our job is to project manage these so they come in a form and format you're expecting.,174,,
1120,0.97,6654.247,6654.681,They're submitted.,174,,
1121,0.97,6654.681,6659.285,"We're working on ones that have been in use in the city for several years, some for decades.",174,,
1122,0.97,6659.285,6662.088,There are these parts of the sur.,174,,
1123,0.97,6662.088,6669.696,This is a private impact assessment and it is compromised of the questions that need to be answered around data collection management and policy.,174,,
1124,0.97,6669.696,6679.773,There are over 50 of those questions so that is the bulk of the how are we complying with or what are the issues around policy related to data collected and how is that done?,174,,
1125,0.97,6679.773,6682.409,That is a big part of the S. I.,174,,
1126,0.97,6682.409,6682.709,R ..,174,,
1127,0.97,6682.709,6685.011,Next speaks to a cost benefit analysis.,174,,
1128,0.97,6685.011,6687.781,What does it cost to run the Technologies?,174,,
1129,0.97,6687.781,6697.39,We conduct a version of the racial equity tool kit you're aware of to get rid of the disparity use or concerns in the community.,174,,
1130,0.97,6697.39,6699.225,The next is public engagement.,174,,
1131,0.97,6699.225,6703.963,We collect comments and analysis to public engagement done over a public comment period as well as actual events.,174,,
1132,0.97,6703.963,6707.534,"Some used to be in person, not anymore.",174,,
1133,0.97,6707.534,6708.368,Not this year.,174,,
1134,0.97,6708.368,6708.668,Last year.,174,,
1135,0.97,6708.668,6714.174,The next is a privacy and civil liberties impact.,174,,
1136,0.97,6714.174,6717.41,That is the body from the folks from the community.,174,,
1137,0.97,6717.41,6719.579,Almost half appointed by the Legislature.,174,,
1138,0.97,6719.579,6729.756,The other half by executives that come to give us perspective and input and comment on these civil liberties perspective from a community perspective.,174,,
1139,0.97,6729.756,6746.239,"The next is a Cto response and we package this together with what Councilmember Pedersen mentioned, an executive over view to make this more accessible for the community to understand all of the stuff in this thing because we also have Ãšsupporting documentation policy references, a whole lot of steps.",174,,
1140,0.97,6746.239,6751.344,"Some are quite large, some are smaller.",174,,
1141,0.97,6751.344,6752.846,We try to give an Synopsis.,174,,
1142,0.97,6752.846,6758.752,This will help the departments make these presentable to you all and help move along the process.,174,,
1143,0.97,6758.752,6759.486,"Next slide, please.",174,,
1144,0.97,6759.486,6761.454,"These take time, as you can imagine.",174,,
1145,0.97,6761.454,6767.026,"Eight to nine months and longer with the request from the public, from the working group to add more time for public engagement.",174,,
1146,0.97,6767.026,6768.895,We start with the draft of the reviews.,174,,
1147,0.97,6768.895,6770.497,We go to a public comment period.,174,,
1148,0.97,6770.497,6773.733,We look at the public comments to look for themes for the ordinance request.,174,,
1149,0.97,6773.733,6775.935,The working group has a couple of months to look at this.,174,,
1150,0.97,6775.935,6782.742,"We look at this one more time to see if there are comments, changes or policy updates we want to make based on the comments.",174,,
1151,0.97,6782.742,6786.98,Now we're at the part where we bring these to you.,174,,
1152,0.97,6786.98,6787.18,Okay.,174,,
1153,0.97,6787.18,6790.35,I believe we'll get onto the Technologies that we're discussing today.,174,,
1154,0.97,6790.35,6796.723,So the first one is for Seattle city light.,174,,
1155,0.97,6796.723,6799.526,"Three Technologies that they use, binoculars, check meter device.",174,,
1156,0.97,6799.526,6801.628,These are used by the current diversion team.,174,,
1157,0.97,6801.628,6808.635,"They go out and do investigations when billing does not equal or does not add up for the use of electricity, they go in and figure out what is happening.",174,,
1158,0.97,6808.635,6821.347,They have a way to look at meters from a distance if they're not able to get to the meter directly and a way to measure current on the technology that we provide from the city so we can see where the discrepancy lies.,174,,
1159,0.97,6821.347,6825.051,The next is the only technology that fire is going to speak to.,174,,
1160,0.97,6825.051,6836.029,"That is the computer aided dispatch or CAD technology used to initiate public safety laws figuring out who to dispatch, what research is required in response to an emergency.",174,,
1161,0.97,6836.029,6847.307,"While this is opt in, obviously, we're opting in information for people making a 911 call, personal identifiable information may be provided.",174,,

1163,0.97,6850.743,6853.246,Cad is used in the same way.,174,,
1164,0.97,6853.246,6863.423,6 and 7 speak to license plate reader technology that police use for patrols so this has to do with identifying stolen cars or other public safety issues and parking enforcement.,174,,
1165,0.97,6863.423,6871.497,They are related but separate so they come in two different flavors for automated license plate reader.,174,,
1166,0.97,6871.497,6876.836,The eighth is cop logic allowing individuals and retail organizations to submit police reports Online.,174,,
1167,0.97,6876.836,6887.046,"These are for low level crimes, Nonemergency situations where 911 call would dispatch an officer and that is not necessarily appropriate, but information should be gathered.",174,,
1168,0.97,6887.046,6892.619,"These are usually for, and captain McDonough is here.",174,,
1169,0.97,6892.619,6900.793,That is number eight here and number nine is 911 logging recorder.,174,,
1170,0.97,6900.793,6904.33,It provides Networked access to the logged Telephony and radio voice recorder.,174,,
1171,0.97,6904.33,6914.173,It is information about police behavior and any other kind of legal discovery so we have a record of what happened and what was dispatched or what the call was like for 911 intake.,174,,
1172,0.97,6914.173,6917.076,These are the Technologies we're here to discuss.,174,,
1173,0.97,6917.076,6923.983,"Omari will take--now, Omari is on my team.",174,,
1174,0.97,6923.983,6926.753,He is responsible and Tasked with ensuring we move these along.,174,,
1175,0.97,6926.753,6930.59,He will talk about the public engagement process we engage in.,174,,
1176,0.97,6930.59,6930.957,Go ahead.,174,,
1177,0.97,6930.957,6939.332,"Thanks for the Intro, ginger and thank you, chair Pedersen for having us, members of the committee and others from my S.",175,,
1178,0.97,6939.332,6940.5,I. R. leads.,175,,
1179,0.97,6940.5,6956.849,We'll talk about the public engagement we did for the technologies and I want to back up a little bit and talk about the groupings we have in the Technologies came from a Council request to bundle the Technologies together so we can have the piece meal views of these.,175,,
1180,0.97,6956.849,6959.485,We can look at them in bundles.,175,,
1181,0.97,6959.485,6964.557,In 2019 we did a wide reach for public engagement to the Technologies.,175,,
1182,0.97,6964.557,6970.93,This is a screen shot of the Website that we put up.,175,,
1183,0.97,6970.93,6971.464,Seattle.Gov/Surveillance.,175,,
1184,0.97,6971.464,6971.931,Easy site to get to.,175,,
1185,0.97,6971.931,6975.101,We post all of the drafts or documents.,175,,
1186,0.97,6975.101,6983.142,"The drafts of the impact report, a one page flyer, summary of the technology.",175,,
1187,0.97,6983.142,6989.015,It is also translated to the seven tier one languages in the city.,175,,
1188,0.97,6989.015,6999.158,"We introduced one to two minute videos of the Technologies we posted Online so people can get an understanding of what is the technology, what is it used for and what are the potential concerns around the use of the technology.",175,,
1189,0.97,6999.158,7007.467,"This is in support of getting the public informed about, a, the use of the technologies, but also informing the opinions about what are their concerns about it?",175,,
1190,0.97,7007.467,7009.635,Do they see a benefit to this?,175,,
1191,0.97,7009.635,7011.104,A concern that they have?,175,,
1192,0.97,7011.104,7020.079,And provide them the context to provide public comment and review that this body can look at when they're looking at the S. I. R ..,175,,
1193,0.97,7020.079,7023.75,All of the public comment we do gets bundled up and put in.,175,,
1194,0.97,7023.75,7039.165,You can see the analysis of what do we point out as the major concerns that people saw as well as the individual comments from residents or organizations who wrote for or expressing concerns for the Technologies.,175,,
1195,0.97,7039.165,7041.401,Moving on to more detailed view.,175,,
1196,0.97,7041.401,7043.269,We held public engagement two years ago.,175,,
1197,0.97,7043.269,7051.244,We had a combination of Online opportunities and in person events hosted in community at Seattle public library locations.,175,,
1198,0.97,7051.244,7057.05,We called it a technology fair style event similar to what you hear from departments today.,175,,
1199,0.97,7057.05,7065.658,We had the Department subject matter experts come and speak and provide information about the technologies and have the ability for folks to ask questions about the use of the Technologies.,175,,
1200,0.97,7065.658,7073.966,These presentations that we did in person were recorded and posted Online in case folks couldn't attend or wanted to review them later for providing the public comment.,175,,
1201,0.97,7073.966,7079.439,"As I mentioned, we did produce the two minute Video over views of the Technologies as well.",175,,
1202,0.97,7079.439,7080.506,Those also had translated captions.,175,,
1203,0.97,7080.506,7086.312,We really wanted to make sure that folks had the ability to engage with these however they wanted to.,175,,
1204,0.97,7086.312,7099.492,We also partnered with the Department of neighborhoods to make sure we're doing outreach to folks that have R not receiving the normal channels who may not be aware of the Online offering.,175,,
1205,0.97,7099.492,7121.914,"You can see here the comments received from the different engagement methods, we ran an Online survey, by far the most successful way for people to easily provide Online comments, but we also did accept comments by mail into an E-mail Inbox, surveillance @ Seattle.Gov.",175,,
1206,0.97,7121.914,7132.091,"Really, our emphasis is making sure people know what Technologies are under review, provide the information to them and get the information back in the form of comments and/or analysis.",175,,
1207,0.97,7132.091,7133.96,That concludes the slides we wanted to present.,176,,
1208,0.97,7133.96,7143.236,"We wanted to give an over view of what the S. I. R. S. are, how we got the information we did and central staff will take you through the rest of the presentation.",176,,
1209,0.97,7143.236,7152.311,We're here to answer any questions about any of the part that we are participating in and that concludes what we have.,176,,
1210,0.97,7152.311,7153.813,Thank you.,177,,
1211,0.97,7153.813,7160.086,"Yes, we would like to get lise Kaye's comments and presentation.",177,,
1212,0.97,7160.086,7177.47,"Of course, Councilmembers, lise Kaye from central staff did write a memo for each of the on on the other hands ordinances.",177,,
1213,0.97,7177.47,7180.373,You have a presentation as well.,177,,
1214,0.97,7180.373,7181.14,"Yes, I do.",178,,
1215,0.97,7181.14,7181.507,Am I Unmuted?,178,,
1216,0.97,7181.507,7184.277,"Yes, and we see it now.",179,,
1217,0.97,7184.277,7184.677,Okay.,180,,
1218,0.97,7184.677,7186.145,So I am just making sure.,180,,
1219,0.97,7186.145,7188.314,I have a couple of different versions of this.,180,,
1220,0.97,7188.314,7196.556,I want to make sure I have the right version.,180,,
1221,0.97,7196.556,7208.234,"While lise is doing this, I want to thank her and all who brought this to the committee at this time.",181,,
1222,0.97,7208.234,7208.534,Thank you.,181,,
1223,0.97,7208.534,7209.902,Here we are.,182,,
1224,0.97,7209.902,7211.537,"And, yes, ginger and Omari.",182,,
1225,0.97,7211.537,7213.272,You have been an amazing help.,182,,
1226,0.97,7213.272,7218.11,"Many, many of my questions that I pose to you about the S. I.",182,,
1227,0.97,7218.11,7218.711,R.S.,182,,
1228,0.97,7218.711,7222.648,"It is a fairly large body of work for everybody involved, so thank you all.",182,,
1229,0.97,7222.648,7225.618,It has been a joy working with you as well.,182,,
1230,0.97,7225.618,7231.19,"I don't know about a joy, but anyhow, it has been good.",182,,
1231,0.97,7231.19,7246.839,"As Councilmember Pedersen said, the committee has three bills before you today that will together approve nine surveillance technologies and accept the surveillance impact report for each of them.",182,,
1232,0.97,7246.839,7254.113,We'll be calling them S. I. R.S because it has fewer consonants.,182,,
1233,0.97,7254.113,7262.855,That is not the right word.,182,,
1234,0.97,7262.855,7263.122,Syllables.,182,,
1235,0.97,7263.122,7270.096,"Let me figure out how to--I'm just trying to move my, here we go.",182,,
1236,0.97,7270.096,7272.665,Finger talked about what was in each S. I. R ..,182,,
1237,0.97,7272.665,7274.7,I won't go overall of this.,182,,
1238,0.97,7274.7,7292.318,"I wanted to let you know in my staff memos, as you all know, I have identified what I have called policy considerations, but I want to note for you, again, this is where the working group recommendations have gone beyond mitigation described in the S. I. R ..",182,,
1239,0.97,7292.318,7296.522,These are not intended as staff recommendations in some cases.,182,,
1240,0.97,7296.522,7301.127,I will NOTE where they are and aren't.,182,,
1241,0.97,7301.127,7309.602,You have three different categories of policy considerations.,182,,
1242,0.97,7309.602,7325.951,"Working group recommendations, information is incomplete and I'll flag if there are particular legal and logistical parameters to address the concerns.",182,,
1243,0.97,7325.951,7332.525,"I'll start with the current diversion properties here, running my multiple screens here.",182,,
1244,0.97,7332.525,7344.47,The first Council bill 12002 is on page seven and eight or use the link on item four of the agenda.,182,,
1245,0.97,7344.47,7349.408,This would approve the use and accepting surveillance impact reports for each.,182,,
1246,0.97,7349.408,7356.949,"As ginger noted, the Technologies are use to investigate suspected electricity theft.",182,,
1247,0.97,7356.949,7366.258,"S. I. R. is attachment one, two, and three and printed on 81 to 526 of your agenda.",182,,
1248,0.97,7366.258,7372.665,It is also provided on 523 of your agenda.,182,,
1249,0.97,7372.665,7388.781,"In the S. I. R. itself, noted that city light had not anticipated any civil liberties impact from the S. I. R. but did plan an equity analysis of past locations to confirm the assumption.",182,,
1250,0.97,7388.781,7391.717,That analysis hasn't been completed yet.,182,,
1251,0.97,7391.717,7397.523,The racial equity tool reports that they have not finalized the Metrics to be used as part of C.,182,,
1252,0.97,7397.523,7399.158,T . O .'s annual equity assessment.,182,,
1253,0.97,7399.158,7402.428,That will be a common finding that you'll see in here.,182,,
1254,0.97,7402.428,7407.833,"The Metrics, most of the departments haven't gotten the Metrics finalized yet.",182,,
1255,0.97,7407.833,7413.906,"In terms of the public comments received, there was some support for the use of the Technologies.",182,,
1256,0.97,7413.906,7424.75,"There was some concern about out dated technology and invasion of privacy, potential invasion of privacy.",182,,
1257,0.97,7424.75,7454.747,"Working group identified one major or submitted one impact assessment for all three technologies and identified three major issues, that the policies don't sufficiently restrict the use of the technologies to a particular purpose and they raise questions about the data protection retention.",182,,
1258,0.97,7454.747,7463.856,"The Cto's response, and again, was that the policy and training provide adequate mitigation to address the working group concerns.",182,,
1259,0.97,7463.856,7475.1,"I do want to note for you that you'll see the bottom line sentence a lot on these slides, but that is really just a consolidation, that is just the bottom line of what they found.",182,,
1260,0.97,7475.1,7476.902,The response memo of the C. T.,182,,
1261,0.97,7476.902,7484.877,O.S have quite a bit more information and they include multiple citations that support the particular finding.,182,,
1262,0.97,7484.877,7503.329,"I will show you, I will reference to you, for example, table one on page four of the staff memo provides the additional details from the Cto's response and you can also see on table two on page four of the staff memo how the S. I. R.",182,,
1263,0.97,7503.329,7505.331,Addresses recommendations and issues.,182,,
1264,0.97,7505.331,7521.814,The distinction between what I have called concerns and impact assessments call concerns and also include a set of specific recommendations.,182,,
1265,0.97,7521.814,7527.92,The recommendations speak to how the working group believes the city council should address those concerns.,182,,
1266,0.97,7527.92,7545.17,The Cto has not addressed the recommendations per se because that really is getting into the departmental area of expertise and that is why we have the folks here from the executive Department to answer some of your questions about that.,182,,
1267,0.97,7545.17,7545.905,"Lisa, thank you.",183,,
1268,0.97,7545.905,7552.144,"We are having a little trouble hearing you, so if you don't mind speaking up for us.",183,,
1269,0.97,7552.144,7553.479,I'm sorry.,184,,
1270,0.97,7553.479,7556.782,Let me use my projecting voice.,184,,
1271,0.97,7556.782,7557.55,All right.,185,,
1272,0.97,7557.55,7557.883,Stage voice.,185,,
1273,0.97,7557.883,7558.117,Okay.,186,,
1274,0.97,7558.117,7561.22,"Yeah, you know, I wasn't in theater but I should have been.",186,,
1275,0.97,7561.22,7564.657,My daughter does that and she taught me a lot.,186,,
1276,0.97,7564.657,7571.764,"So looking at the policy considerations in here, what we flagged.",186,,
1277,0.97,7571.764,7588.447,"The working group recommended the explicit limitations on the use of Technologies so the Council may consider, as Pedersen noted adopting the use along with the S. I. R.S.",186,,
1278,0.97,7588.447,7593.485,The over views represent the only allowable use of the data collected by the technology.,186,,
1279,0.97,7593.485,7622.681,"The next two considerations are things that I flagged and you'll see, again, this will come up on most of these, that the Department hasn't finished completing its Metrics for the annual equity assessment and also, I did some investigation into why the S. I. R. was titled Binoculars/Spotting scope.",186,,
1280,0.97,7622.681,7627.82,They say they're just using them for binoculars.,186,,
1281,0.97,7627.82,7631.023,I would probably recommend taking off the reference to spotting scope.,186,,
1282,0.97,7631.023,7634.026,It is not a term used in S. I.,186,,
1283,0.97,7634.026,7635.394,R. anywhere else.,186,,
1284,0.97,7635.394,7642.868,I would pause here for any questions that the Councilmembers may want to pose to the executive.,186,,
1285,0.97,7642.868,7643.936,"Thank you, lise.",187,,
1286,0.97,7643.936,7656.081,"We want to hear questions about the first ordinance, which is the Seattle city light Technologies that they use.",188,,
1287,0.97,7656.081,7667.559,Lise Kaye has a central staff memo on the ordinance and there is also an executive over view which summarizes the surveillance impact report.,188,,
1288,0.97,7667.559,7674.767,"Councilmember Morales has her hand up and it looks like Councilmember Herbold will have questions, too.",188,,
1289,0.97,7674.767,7675.901,"Councilmember Morales, go ahead, please.",188,,
1290,0.97,7675.901,7676.602,Thank you.,189,,
1291,0.97,7676.602,7681.573,"Thank you so much, everyone, for your presentation.",189,,
1292,0.97,7681.573,7687.78,"Lise, I really appreciate the extensive memo that we have.",189,,
1293,0.97,7687.78,7695.654,"One thing that, I know there are several common issues that have been raised across all of these S. I. R.S.",189,,
1294,0.97,7695.654,7708.267,"I would like to know, you know it sounds like for all of them, the issue of identifying Metrics for the equity assessment has not been completed.",189,,
1295,0.97,7708.267,7711.637,I don't think for any of them.,189,,
1296,0.97,7711.637,7724.216,"And so one question I definitely have is when is the anticipated, the E. T. A. for when Metrics will be identified and when the assessments will actually begin?",189,,
1297,0.97,7724.216,7733.625,That is obviously an important issue for the city is understanding any disparities that some of the surveillance Technologies may have.,189,,
1298,0.97,7733.625,7741.633,I think that really needs to be bumped up as a priority and would like to hear if there is a plan for that.,189,,
1299,0.97,7741.633,7746.939,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales, I might take that first.",190,,
1300,0.97,7746.939,7768.894,"We have been informing and working with departments on this issue, really from the beginning, since 2017, but because none of the Technologies have been approved yet, we're waiting a little bit to hear what were--were there any additional policy recommendations, additional concerns coming from Council before these were approved before implementing what should the tracking be?",190,,
1301,0.97,7768.894,7772.231,Alerting departments so they will need to start tracking this.,190,,
1302,0.97,7772.231,7783.175,"Racial equity tool kit portion of this identifying some of the areas where that can occur, and the equity report from the Cto was due in September of every year.",190,,
1303,0.97,7783.175,7788.113,"Depending on where these land, we'll have more or less data to offer.",190,,
1304,0.97,7788.113,7790.282,"For example, group one S. I. R.",190,,
1305,0.97,7790.282,7794.186,Will have something to offer in September for the equity review.,190,,
1306,0.97,7794.186,7795.621,It is an ongoing piece of work.,190,,
1307,0.97,7795.621,7800.859,We can come back to you and report what we have landed on for each of these.,190,,
1308,0.97,7800.859,7812.471,That is probably the best answer I can give you at this time.,190,,
1309,0.97,7812.471,7813.839,Thank you.,191,,
1310,0.97,7813.839,7814.339,Councilmember Herbold?,191,,
1311,0.97,7814.339,7815.274,Thank you.,192,,
1312,0.97,7815.274,7821.046,Two questions on this one.,192,,
1313,0.97,7821.046,7824.016,The first relates to records retentions.,192,,
1314,0.97,7824.016,7854.947,"I don't know if you're capturing the policy consideration under restrictions on this or whether or not it would be a separate policy consideration, but I'm interested to know for these investigations whether or not they maintain records and if so, how long they maintain the records and whether or not there are restrictions on the use of the records.",192,,
1315,0.97,7854.947,7875.167,"Secondly, just curious, I don't know, chair Pedersen if you would consider this a policy question as opposed to a question that is really focused on the technology itself, but I just generally have a question of why binoculars are still being used after the installation of advanced meters.",192,,
1316,0.97,7875.167,7881.206,"If you don't mind, I'll turn that over to the city light Rep here to answer those questions.",193,,
1317,0.97,7881.206,7895.654,"I would note that all of the departments retain records consistent with the state retention schedule, which is actually in Rcw.",193,,
1318,0.97,7895.654,7899.057,The break down I will leave to city light to talk about.,193,,
1319,0.97,7899.057,7901.326,Councilmember Herbold it is a great question.,194,,
1320,0.97,7901.326,7902.928,We should get those questions out.,194,,
1321,0.97,7902.928,7921.747,"I think it is when we get to the appointment of amendments that if they go too much into a policy unrelated to Technologies but for the questions it is a good question, so city light is here, I think potentially to answer that.",194,,
1322,0.97,7921.88,7922.347,[inaudible].,194,,
1323,0.97,7922.481,7930.922,"Sorry, we're not able to hear you.",195,,
1324,0.97,7930.922,7932.424,How is that?,196,,
1325,0.97,7932.424,7932.891,Is that better?,196,,
1326,0.97,7932.891,7933.592,Sorry about that.,196,,
1327,0.97,7933.592,7935.727,I don't use zoom very often.,196,,
1328,0.97,7935.727,7937.162,My settings were not right.,196,,
1329,0.97,7937.162,7941.633,"Good morning Councilmembers, my name is Michelle Vargo.",196,,
1330,0.97,7941.633,7944.269,I'm the deputy chief operating officer for Seattle city light.,196,,
1331,0.97,7944.269,7946.605,The AMI question is a great question.,196,,
1332,0.97,7946.605,7950.208,I was hoping to have an opportunity to speak about that.,196,,
1333,0.97,7950.208,7966.124,"Definitely, I don't disagree with any of the recommendations that this process has uncovered and I think in particular when we talk about the policy surrounding this program, AMI certainly has an impact on the program.",196,,
1334,0.97,7966.124,7969.962,It is diminishing our need for any of the tools.,196,,
1335,0.97,7969.962,7981.373,"Certainly there is not 100% roll out of AMI so there may be circumstances where we're still using these technologies, but I can tell you the research that I have done.",196,,
1336,0.97,7981.373,7997.689,"We have a new current coordinator as of late 2018 and she has told me that we have only used these technologies, actually two of the technologies, less than six times since she started in this position, so these are not Technologies that we're using quite often.",196,,
1337,0.97,7997.689,8011.203,"I think we were just trying to be fully transparent with the programs and making sure that they were visible, that we do occasionally use them.",196,,
1338,0.97,8011.203,8015.707,Does that answer the question?,196,,
1339,0.97,8015.707,8024.983,"So for the AMI question, so you're saying that the binoculars are used in cases where people opted out of AMI.",197,,
1340,0.97,8024.983,8030.055,That is what the purpose of allowing the use of binoculars?,197,,
1341,0.97,8030.055,8046.738,"Again, it seems like all of the information you would need to do an investigation could be captured without binoculars for people who have not opted out of AMI.",197,,
1342,0.97,8046.738,8051.376,"I'm sorry, I don't quite understand the question.",198,,
1343,0.97,8051.376,8059.851,The use of binoculars should not be needed for people who opted out of AMI?,198,,
1344,0.97,8059.851,8069.261,I thought you said they're still in use because AMI is not 100% rolled out.,199,,
1345,0.97,8069.261,8091.149,"I'm just trying to--given that all of the information that would allow you to investigate potential electricity theft is Capturable without the binoculars for people with an AMI system, I'm trying to understand why you still have binoculars as one of your surveillance Technologies.",199,,
1346,0.97,8091.149,8098.256,What I thought I heard you say is because AMI is not 100% rolled out.,199,,
1347,0.97,8098.256,8106.598,"That is exactly true, Councilmember.",200,,
1348,0.97,8106.598,8107.099,This is Deborra Smith.,200,,
1349,0.97,8107.099,8120.011,"Yes, there will be times when we need to put visual eyes on meters that are behind a fence or behind a place where we have access to for diversion purposes.",200,,
1350,0.97,8120.011,8132.624,"That number will continue to go down as we complete our AMI roll out, which right now has been 27,000 meters that have not been updated.",200,,
1351,0.97,8132.624,8139.965,"The use of binoculars or spotting scopes, we're using them at times to read the meter for those customers who you accurately brought up.",200,,
1352,0.97,8139.965,8161.586,"That will be the case for customers who opt out in certain situations indefinitely, but right now we're still having to use the devices to read meters that we have not yet converted, so those, once those are all complete, the number of times that we will use any of the tools will be dramatically reduced.",200,,
1353,0.97,8161.586,8161.92,Thank you.,201,,
1354,0.97,8161.92,8169.06,And then I still have the question about the records retention length.,201,,
1355,0.97,8169.06,8194.286,"Lisa did mention that there is an Rcw that defines this, but I thought I remembered also from a central staff briefing that lise gave one of the departments we're hearing from today holds onto the records much longer than the minimum requirement in the Rcw.",201,,
1356,0.97,8194.286,8202.193,"I don't remember which Department it was, so I'm asking.",201,,
1357,0.97,8202.193,8203.228,That was Seattle fire.,202,,
1358,0.97,8203.228,8207.599,They keep theirs consistent with the schedule.,202,,
1359,0.97,8207.599,8216.608,"Rcw is 40-14, the records retention Act and all of the retention schedules are on the web page.",202,,
1360,0.97,8216.608,8218.343,Thank you so much.,203,,
1361,0.97,8218.343,8223.281,We'll get you the fire Department technology next.,204,,
1362,0.97,8223.281,8224.783,"Any questions, more, for the Seattle city light?",204,,
1363,0.97,8224.783,8229.187,Obviously we can go back to this later if you think of something.,204,,
1364,0.97,8229.187,8240.765,"For now, Councilmembers, anything on Seattle city lights, three Technologies already in use, or may we move to the fire Department?",204,,
1365,0.97,8240.765,8247.172,"Lise Kaye, why don't we move to the fire Department.",204,,
1366,0.97,8247.172,8253.478,"You're on mute, lise Kaye.",204,,
1367,0.97,8253.478,8257.515,I would have to speak even louder than usual if I'm muted.,205,,
1368,0.97,8257.515,8257.716,Okay.,205,,
1369,0.97,8257.716,8263.521,So this is the second bill that is before the committee today.,205,,
1370,0.97,8263.521,8271.663,It is Council bill 120003 on page 603 of your agenda materials or find a link on item five of your agenda.,205,,
1371,0.97,8271.663,8279.804,It would approve the Seattle fire Department's continued use of computer dispatch technology and accept the completed S. I.,205,,
1372,0.97,8279.804,8280.005,R ..,205,,
1373,0.97,8280.005,8285.81,It is attachment one and can be found on 606 of your general materials.,205,,
1374,0.97,8285.81,8290.515,My staff memo on this item begins on page 968 of your agenda materials.,205,,
1375,0.97,8290.515,8293.318,I would note that this S. I. R.,205,,
1376,0.97,8293.318,8297.289,Has been updated on reflect the merger of the technology vendor.,205,,
1377,0.97,8297.289,8302.227,The technology was provided by a company called Tri-Tech for years and years and years.,205,,
1378,0.97,8302.227,8307.966,It recently merged with two other vendors into central square.,205,,
1379,0.97,8307.966,8316.541,I know the impact assessment asked about whether that merger affected any of the privacy and contractual provisions.,205,,
1380,0.97,8316.541,8321.68,I have been advised by Seattle fire that those provisions remain the same.,205,,
1381,0.97,8321.68,8332.757,The S. I. R. has been updated to reflect the merger.,205,,
1382,0.97,8332.757,8356.848,"The S. I. R. identified two potential civil liberty unions, potential impacts and personal identifiable information and sensitive information could be used by law enforcement to target historical marginalized communities.",205,,
1383,0.97,8356.848,8377.402,"This technology is the system that helps advise the Dispatchers who take the 911 calls to the fire Department about which units are available, whether those are Emt units or ladder trucks, things like that, which units are available and which ones should potentially be deployed to the particular call.",205,,
1384,0.97,8377.402,8379.37,So the fire Department in the S.,205,,
1385,0.97,8379.37,8396.588,I. R. identified how they would mitigate the impacts that they identified by asking people who are asking for public disclosure requests to voluntary Redact personal information before receiving the response.,205,,
1386,0.97,8396.588,8405.563,"They also notified at times, individuals who may be affected so they can seek a court order to enjoin the release of the records.",205,,
1387,0.97,8405.563,8419.911,They provide information to law enforcement only relative to an active investigation and that has to be confirmed by the fire Department's public disclosure officer and recorded.,205,,
1388,0.97,8419.911,8429.888,The fire Department uses equality insurance manager to check the data for accuracy and compliance with the departmental dispatch policies and procedures.,205,,
1389,0.97,8429.888,8442.734,"I would note, again, you already heard from ginger why the annual equity assessments Mettics hadn't been completed yet in terms of public comments that came in with respect to the technology.",205,,
1390,0.97,8442.734,8446.037,There weren't very many of those.,205,,
1391,0.97,8446.037,8447.238,Some expressed support.,205,,
1392,0.97,8447.238,8462.22,"Some, again, expressed concerns about the technology and potential invasion of privacy.",205,,
1393,0.97,8462.22,8469.761,"The policy considerations identified for you, my notes here, sorry, speak to the restrictions on the use.",205,,
1394,0.97,8469.761,8475.433,So recommendation is that you could adopt the executive over view again.,205,,
1395,0.97,8475.433,8480.605,This is the issue that Councilmember Herbold flagged on data retention.,205,,
1396,0.97,8480.605,8488.646,The fire Department holds these records for the life of the technology system.,205,,
1397,0.97,8488.646,8492.417,That is in excess of the minimum requirements of state law.,205,,
1398,0.97,8492.417,8502.961,They require six years of retention for fire incident reports and three years for back updates.,205,,
1399,0.97,8502.961,8515.073,They may want to request the fire Department to establish the data for which the fire Department retains the data.,205,,
1400,0.97,8515.073,8517.141,#.,205,,
1401,0.97,8517.141,8520.445,This is also a recommendation you'll see coming up.,205,,
1402,0.97,8520.445,8525.683,That they should hold the third party partners to the same restrictions that the city is held to.,205,,
1403,0.97,8525.683,8532.557,This was a recommendation that was made for the group one S. I.,205,,
1404,0.97,8532.557,8545.303,"R.S specifically, for example, the working group suggested that the city should be holding the State Department of transportation to the privacy requirements and there are just, that is not really feasible.",205,,
1405,0.97,8545.303,8563.254,We can't really tell the levels of government how they should operate and some instances it may not be feasible to even require that of some of our major third party contractors.,205,,
1406,0.97,8563.254,8576.768,You already heard the discussion that these will be forth coming.,205,,
1407,0.97,8576.768,8582.707,I would pause here for any questions.,205,,
1408,0.97,8582.707,8583.474,Thank you.,206,,
1409,0.97,8583.474,8596.587,I know Councilmember Herbold's question earlier seems to apply here on the data retention.,206,,
1410,0.97,8596.587,8598.256,It sounds like they're holding law.,206,,
1411,0.97,8598.256,8608.9,We're picking up themes here of potential amendments or additional guard rails.,206,,
1412,0.97,8608.9,8615.073,We're Pausing here at the fire Department dispatch.,206,,
1413,0.97,8615.073,8629.787,"The existing technology, we Extinctively know the need for computer aided dispatch for the fire Department and they have done a lot of work we want to ask questions about.",206,,
1414,0.97,8629.787,8644.902,"Lise Kaye's memo is available which highlights some of the things in her power point here and getting to her by March 10th, next Wednesday with any potential amendments would be helpful so that we can proceed on March 17th.",206,,
1415,0.97,8644.902,8648.272,We obviously have the police Department items coming up next.,206,,
1416,0.97,8648.272,8651.909,I predict that we will be here in Committee at least until 12:30.,206,,
1417,0.97,8651.909,8657.648,We'll try to wrap it up by 12:30.,206,,
1418,0.97,8657.648,8671.029,"I know this is going long here, but we do need to get through the Technologies as part of the committee work.",206,,
1419,0.97,8671.262,8730.354,These are attached to the Council bill 120004 are attached on your agenda as is my staff memo.,206,,
1420,0.97,8730.354,8732.89,It starts on page 2269.,206,,
1421,0.97,8732.89,8736.961,The attachments in your agenda packets are in a different order than what is on the screen.,206,,
1422,0.97,8736.961,8741.165,I followed the order in my staff report.,206,,
1423,0.97,8741.165,8746.337,We have technical glitches for which I apologize.,206,,
1424,0.97,8746.337,8759.283,"We'll talk about the automated license plate readers and the parking enforcement, automated license readers together again.",206,,
1425,0.97,8759.283,8772.396,The automated readers as ginger mentioned are help to identify stolen vehicles and vehicles wanted in conjunction with Felonies.,206,,
1426,0.97,8772.396,8778.603,I moved too fast on my slide.,206,,
1427,0.97,8778.603,8790.781,"They're also used to help, I'm sorry, helped to find wanted persons in the silver and amber alerts.",206,,
1428,0.97,8790.781,8801.893,The S. I. R. for the technology identified potential impacts that they could be used to identify individuals without committing a crime.,206,,
1429,0.97,8801.893,8815.339,Used to search information not related to a particular investigation and there is a risk of the historically targeted communities could be overly surveillance.,206,,
1430,0.97,8815.339,8856.447,"Public comments that came in on this, back in 2018, were identifying some support of concerns about data retention security privacy potential for error and misuse of surveillance in general, so I want to note the SPD did update the relevant policies after that fall 2018 public engagement period and have the S. I. R. include updated policies that address authorized uses and expanding Unrequired training for employees and a number of other issues.",206,,
1431,0.97,8856.447,8859.75,Thanks for raising that point.,207,,
1432,0.97,8859.75,8865.323,I think this technology ordinance started in 2017.,207,,
1433,0.97,8865.323,8884.775,"Councilmember Gonzalez was the lead sponsor on the original surveillance and it was amended in 2018 with Councilmember Gonzalez, Councilmembers at the time, so what is interesting is the S. I. R.'s process actually got the police Department already to update the policies on some of the measures.",207,,
1434,0.97,8884.775,8906.464,I know we'll still have questions and issues that we'll raise but it was good to hear the long S. I. R.'s process resulted in policies being changed in real time to tighten things up.,207,,
1435,0.97,8906.464,8906.764,Thank you.,207,,
1436,0.97,8906.764,8907.198,You're welcome.,208,,
1437,0.97,8907.198,8920.811,"Foreshadowing the parking enforcement that many of the same assessment issues were identified for parking systems, too, so I will be referring to these.",208,,
1438,0.97,8920.811,8936.193,"Working group identified the question of data, have questions about data access and sharing, how the system would be audited and whether the Technologies actually produce measurable outcome in crime solving.",208,,
1439,0.97,8936.193,8945.369,The C. T . O .'s response was that the updated policies of training and limitations of the Technologies themselves provide adequate mitigation.,208,,
1440,0.97,8945.369,8953.477,"You'll see tables that I have in my staff memo, table one on page four and five provides additional details about the C.",208,,
1441,0.97,8953.477,8954.078,T . O .'s response.,208,,
1442,0.97,8954.078,8960.851,Table two on page six of the staff memo show how the S. I. R.,208,,
1443,0.97,8960.851,8967.425,Addresses issues pertaining specifically to the recommendations.,208,,
1444,0.97,8967.425,8978.202,"At this point, the main policy consideration that hasn't been addressed in the S. I. R. is the restriction on use.",208,,
1445,0.97,8978.202,8982.44,That is the recommendation that the committee could deduct the executive over view.,208,,
1446,0.97,8982.44,8993.05,Let me just move right into the parking enforcement systems then in the interest of time.,208,,
1447,0.97,8993.05,9006.597,The parking enforcement system license plate reader system are used to enforce parking laws and also can provide information in support of findings for vehicles or those sought in connection with a criminal investigation.,208,,
1448,0.97,9006.597,9018.743,This S. I. R. was updated in 2019 after the public engagement process in the fall of 2018.,208,,
1449,0.97,9018.743,9026.751,The same potential civil liberties and impacts were identified in the S. I. R ..,208,,
1450,0.97,9026.751,9040.364,The S. I. R. did note that response to the updated policies that were put in place after February 1ST would be compiled and analyzed as part of the annual equity assessments.,208,,
1451,0.97,9040.364,9056.747,"Public comments, and again, these are from the fall of 2018, expressed some support concerns about data retention, concerns about equitable enforcement and overall, concerns about surveillance.",208,,
1452,0.97,9056.747,9078.402,"The policy considerations with respect to these two technologies, or parking enforcement systems which overlap, the data sharing, this is one that would flag is that the working group suggested that patrol and parking enforcement do not share data.",208,,
1453,0.97,9078.402,9085.543,That would be a meter change in how police Department operates right now.,208,,
1454,0.97,9085.543,9093.651,Any amendments we'll be breaking close with the city attorney's office on how to structure that kind of amendment.,208,,
1455,0.97,9093.651,9108.666,"The impact assessment also asked about how the system is audited and, again, the same question about how effective is this technology in actually reducing crimes.",208,,
1456,0.97,9108.666,9116.774,So I think I had one more policy consideration.,208,,
1457,0.97,9116.774,9134.425,"It didn't come out of the working group is that for reasons not entirely clear of the hardware for the parking enforcement, the cameras themselves are characterized in the S. I. R. as surveillance technology.",208,,
1458,0.97,9134.425,9142.7,There is an explicit statement that the software used to get the information off the hardware is Nonsurveillance technology.,208,,
1459,0.97,9142.7,9147.972,. There has been a lot of turnover in the police Department since this was drafted.,208,,
1460,0.97,9147.972,9153.344,There wasn't an institutional memory as for the rational for doing that.,208,,
1461,0.97,9153.344,9171.395,"It would actually be my recommendation that the Council consider adopting, if they adopted the S. I. R., they would note that would be approving the software as surveillance technology also.",208,,
1462,0.97,9171.395,9177.101,.,208,,
1463,0.97,9177.101,9211.468,"Because of the policy consideration, the second one there, data sharing between patrol, police patrol, and parking enforcement, so I guess, we do have a representative from the police Department here, Captain McDonough and captain, you know, if you're not able to answer these questions on the spot, if it is something where you can get back to lise Kaye on our city council central staff, or we can sort of get the questions out on to the record and we have three more technologies to go over.",209,,
1464,0.97,9211.468,9218.409,"Real quick, the benefits, so currently there is data sharing between patrol and parking enforcement?",209,,
1465,0.97,9218.409,9219.343,Is that correct?,209,,
1466,0.97,9219.343,9221.579,Not from patrol to parking enforcement.,210,,
1467,0.97,9221.579,9228.719,"And thank you, Councilmember, for the opportunity to speak, not between patrol and the parking enforcement.",210,,
1468,0.97,9228.719,9235.859,It is from parking enforcement to patrol so we can check for the vehicles that may or may not have been void in the criminal activity.,210,,
1469,0.97,9235.859,9244.902,"Yes, there is sharing across the board, but it is, the only ones that share with us.",210,,
1470,0.97,9244.902,9248.038,They will pop up on the patrol when they do the patrols.,210,,
1471,0.97,9248.038,9254.745,Thank you for that clarification.,211,,
1472,0.97,9254.745,9260.284,As we know there are discussions about having parking enforcement move to a different Department.,211,,
1473,0.97,9260.284,9273.197,That is something we may want to keep our eye on in terms of what is the policy for that sharing from parking enforcement choosing to share it with SPD patrol.,211,,
1474,0.97,9273.197,9277.935,"It doesn't, to me it doesn't speak to the technology itself.",211,,
1475,0.97,9277.935,9282.006,"It is something, a policy I think we want to keep an eye on.",211,,
1476,0.97,9282.006,9284.341,Others may disagree on how I'm framing that.,211,,
1477,0.97,9284.341,9285.275,I want to raise this issue.,211,,
1478,0.97,9285.275,9294.351,"It is a concern that has been raised about parking enforcement, folks sharing the information with the patrol.",211,,
1479,0.97,9294.351,9327.551,"This is a good moment for me to thank our surveillance working group, a group of, it is like an advisory board that we have that volunteers and meets to participate in this process to give us, to raise concerns early, to hold everybody accountable, so I want to thank all of the people that have VOF volunteered in the past and currently with surveillance working group that I'm Digressing here.",211,,
1480,0.97,9327.551,9336.86,"Councilmembers, on the first two SPD technologies, the license plate reader and parking enforcement, is there anything you would like to raise?",211,,
1481,0.97,9336.86,9337.361,Councilmember Herbold?,211,,
1482,0.97,9337.361,9342.099,Thank you.,212,,
1483,0.97,9342.099,9344.068,As it relates specifically to.,212,,
1484,0.97,9344.068,9349.973,This would come up to the 911 question.,212,,
1485,0.97,9349.973,9369.126,"The issue of data sharing aside, I'm just flagging whether or not there needs to be a consideration of a technical change given that we're talking about SPD enforcement systems when it will not be an SPD parking enforcement system.",212,,
1486,0.97,9369.426,9372.73,F0,212,,
1487,0.97,9450.507,9458.015,"So, real quickly, the Department is committed to transparency and the absence required under the ordinance.",213,,
1488,0.97,9458.015,9473.463,"In terms of this, we are tightened up and made sure there's an accountability feature in the software itself so every user is out Offed and every user has authorization.",213,,
1489,0.97,9473.463,9478.468,Not just everybody can get into the different Ospr systems.,213,,
1490,0.97,9478.468,9482.673,"They have to complete requirements for information sharing, et cetera.",213,,
1491,0.97,9482.673,9504.828,"We do the access training, which is the state of Washington's training, which limits the release of information through your job, and the privacy and information security program in lace by the city.",213,,
1492,0.97,9504.828,9513.67,"We have a 90-day retention, and we follow the law to keep the lineup not too low.",213,,
1493,0.97,9513.67,9516.64,"Real briefly, that's some of the big stuff.",213,,
1494,0.97,9516.64,9527.05,The Office of the inspector General is the other unit that will be performing audits on all these units and can perform any audits required.,213,,
1495,0.97,9529.486,9533.457,Thank you.,214,,
1496,0.97,9533.457,9535.125,Thank you.,215,,
1497,0.97,9535.125,9551.041,"Council members, we can go into the other three items.",215,,
1498,0.97,9551.041,9556.246,"Apologies, I will lower my hand.",216,,
1499,0.97,9556.246,9557.281,Okay.,217,,
1500,0.97,9557.281,9561.118,The next one is the dispatch.,217,,
1501,0.97,9561.118,9584.074,"As ginger mentioned, this is a parallel system that performs the same functions as dispatch.",217,,
1502,0.97,9584.074,9587.978,I need to have somebody working my slide.,217,,
1503,0.97,9587.978,9593.116,"I'd help you if I could, Lisa.",218,,
1504,0.97,9593.116,9595.786,"I apologize, people.",219,,
1505,0.97,9595.786,9606.43,"I've hit the wrong arrows and it's annoying to everybody, I'm sure.",219,,
1506,0.97,9606.43,9615.105,"So the police identify potential civil liberties impacts, as you see on the screen here.",219,,
1507,0.97,9615.105,9621.812,I'll just flip through this here.,219,,
1508,0.97,9621.812,9629.152,Impact assessment issues were raised by the working group with respect to the data access and retention.,219,,
1509,0.97,9629.152,9635.392,They specifically said they wanted operators to be trained with the policies.,219,,
1510,0.97,9635.392,9639.129,The server provided information specific to that concern.,219,,
1511,0.97,9639.129,9651.942,"As you'll see in the memo, I've identified where that specific information addressed many of those issues.",219,,
1512,0.97,9651.942,9667.19,So that basically funneled the policy considerations down to these two.,219,,
1513,0.97,9667.19,9670.861,That was a very short version of that particular briefing.,219,,
1514,0.97,9670.861,9682.139,"Did you want to have any questions on that right now, council member Peterson?",219,,
1515,0.97,9682.139,9684.775,What about SPD Computer- aided dispatch?,220,,
1516,0.97,9684.775,9705.095,"It seems throughout this there are concerns about data retention, data being held longer than seems necessary, and the state law which I'm understanding is 90 days.",221,,
1517,0.97,9705.095,9725.982,I'm wondering if there were recommendations or a state of preference for what the data retention policy could look like if it weren't for this state law and if there's any way to address that or try and incorporate something different.,221,,
1518,0.97,9725.982,9738.528,"I can get those specifics to you about the preference for the retention periods, so I could send those to you.",222,,
1519,0.97,9738.528,9750.707,The state law pretty much blushes what they are.,222,,
1520,0.97,9756.146,9759.382,Thanks for that question.,223,,
1521,0.97,9759.382,9759.683,All right.,223,,
1522,0.97,9759.683,9763.887,"The next item, I'm sure we'll have questions about.",223,,
1523,0.97,9763.887,9764.588,Let's dive into that.,223,,
1524,0.97,9764.588,9778.335,I'm going to walk through that more slowly.,224,,
1525,0.97,9778.335,9787.077,"So, the approval would approve continued use of this technology, being used in two applications right now.",224,,
1526,0.97,9787.077,9796.52,"One is individual reporting of low-level crimes, and the other is theft reporting.",224,,
1527,0.97,9796.52,9816.106,"So individual report of Low- level crimes would be, if you were Burglarized, for example, and needed to file an insurance claim, you could file this Online and get the police report number to put into your insurance claim for your insurance claim.",224,,
1528,0.97,9816.106,9832.856,"The they want reporting is different and this is used by business owners to be able to report suspected Shoplifting or shop Lefters, instead of having a police officer show up.",224,,
1529,0.97,9832.856,9849.739,"I would mention that the police say the business application of this saves the police Department a million dollars a year, and 20,000 House of police time a year.",224,,
1530,0.97,9849.739,9860.984,There are significant issues that have been raised by some members about that program.,224,,
1531,0.97,9860.984,9893.25,"The police Department did identify disparate impact for sure as that information could be disseminated in a way that could impact people's civil liberties and could contribute and reinforce racism, which would create a disparate impact on historically targeted communities.",224,,
1532,0.97,9893.25,9905.028,"For the saving of the million dollars and police hours, was that just for the retail component?",225,,
1533,0.97,9905.028,9905.262,Yes.,226,,
1534,0.97,9905.262,9907.33,"Okay, thanks.",227,,
1535,0.97,9907.33,9932.889,"The public comments expressed some support for the technology, I believe for the individual track to be in languages other than English and the potential for bias in the reports and unfair collection of suspects and data retention concerns.",228,,
1536,0.97,9932.889,9952.942,"So the impact assessment issues Parallelled a lot of those with the data retention, impacts of civil liberties retail theft program.",228,,
1537,0.97,9952.942,9962.385,The group discontinued reaching outside through the track.,228,,
1538,0.97,9962.385,9966.523,The Cto's response was providing quality mitigation for concerns.,228,,
1539,0.97,9966.523,9976.399,"Again, those would be best addressed by the departments affected by the recommendations.",228,,
1540,0.97,9976.399,9982.706,Cto doesn't have insight into how all the departments operate.,228,,
1541,0.97,9982.706,10020.31,"With the concerns I've identified going forward, the retail theft reporting amendment is affecting something that I would want to work on how to craft that amendment, and the request for the same privacy restrictions the city has, which may be definitely to negotiate.",228,,
1542,0.97,10020.31,10033.223,"Again, the Council could request to look into that where feasible.",228,,
1543,0.97,10033.223,10041.931,Those are the two issues I saw.,228,,
1544,0.97,10041.931,10055.945,This top logic is file reports Online and the retail company where store owners and proprietors can register things without having the police show up?,229,,
1545,0.97,10055.945,10067.69,But we have the captain here to talk further about this.,229,,
1546,0.97,10067.69,10069.793,Council member Morales?,229,,
1547,0.97,10069.793,10072.328,Thank you.,230,,
1548,0.97,10072.328,10080.336,"You want to just Rela the issues with top logic, concerns that folks have.",230,,
1549,0.97,10080.336,10101.124,"We received lot of comments from folks, one of whom suggested that a lot of concerns could be minimized by going from a Cloud-Hosted service to a locally hosted system.",230,,
1550,0.97,10101.124,10122.345,So I'm wondering if that's being considered as a way to address the work group concerns.,230,,
1551,0.97,10122.345,10122.979,That's a good question.,231,,
1552,0.97,10122.979,10126.382,There are a number Offed Wheres.,232,,
1553,0.97,10126.382,10131.054,"If I'm not mistaken, the Cloud- based services are more financially prudent.",232,,
1554,0.97,10131.054,10142.499,"In terms of sharing of the information, we are looking at the way it was phrased here, that they were sharing our data without our knowledge.",232,,
1555,0.97,10142.499,10155.845,"I don't have the contract here, but most of the contracts limits that, that can it's our data and you're just storing it for us.",232,,
1556,0.97,10155.845,10164.487,"In terms of looking at it, we can do anything the Council requests.",232,,
1557,0.97,10164.487,10172.996,I'll turn that over to ginger or someone else in that.,232,,
1558,0.97,10172.996,10188.177,There are other concerns and the way we vet our cloud providers are being sure the data is owned by the city.,233,,
1559,0.97,10188.177,10198.688,And in many cases there's not a lot of change we can make happen because of other customers in place.,233,,
1560,0.97,10198.688,10212.602,"That's why when we go into contracts, usually any Database they are providing is for our terms.",233,,
1561,0.97,10212.602,10225.882,We don't want to take place without us knowing.,233,,
1562,0.97,10226.683,10232.922,I'll probably have follow-up quest Offline.,234,,
1563,0.97,10232.922,10235.124,We can do that.,235,,
1564,0.97,10235.124,10253.676,"I see other Council members here, and I want to ensure all the other Council members are considering these and what changes need to be made, even if we don't articulate them today.",235,,
1565,0.97,10253.676,10254.01,Thank you.,236,,
1566,0.97,10254.01,10264.053,I just wanted to ask the question publicly that I received information about in the central staff briefing.,236,,
1567,0.97,10264.053,10297.787,"It's my understanding there is no what I to separate out the retail theft reporting component from the member of the public theft reporting component, that those are integrated into a single technology and it's not possible to buy one part of it and not possible Buy/Use the other part of it.",236,,
1568,0.97,10297.787,10300.423,Is that accurate?,236,,
1569,0.97,10300.423,10318.041,"Council member, I think when you and I were talking about that, I was under the impression about whether we were curious if we could have two for each track.",237,,
1570,0.97,10318.041,10320.677,I'll turn that over to the captain.,237,,
1571,0.97,10320.677,10325.915,"Thank you, council member.",238,,
1572,0.97,10325.915,10329.385,I'm not 100% sure because I didn't work on this project.,238,,
1573,0.97,10329.385,10335.224,I'm just here because I know a little bit about it.,238,,
1574,0.97,10335.224,10339.829,The retail theft reporting program is very strict.,238,,
1575,0.97,10339.829,10349.806,"Every report that's submitted is reviewed by a police officer before it's accepted, so the detective in charge of every program reads every report.",238,,
1576,0.97,10349.806,10374.831,"I believe we have 59 5:00 tough Retall stores right now and 12 more, so that reduces the time for people so sit and wait on a police officer.",238,,
1577,0.97,10374.831,10377.867,But there's a number of criteria in there.,238,,
1578,0.97,10377.867,10388.511,They have to describe the crime in Detall analyst all the evidence.,238,,
1579,0.97,10388.511,10421.644,"Unfortunately they usually have a Video system or receipt system and they present all that but once they submit that, they have to sign a form saying all the information is true and correct or face perjury charges.",238,,
1580,0.97,10421.644,10428.251,"There's still that accountability built in saying, Yeah, everything here is accurate.",238,,
1581,0.97,10428.251,10438.161,"Anything that doesn't meet the criteria, the detective kicks back.",238,,
1582,0.97,10438.161,10447.537,"They have I believe 120 days to update the information and answer those, and the detective can accept it and file with the city attorney's office.",238,,
1583,0.97,10447.537,10452.074,They will accept it and it goes into the system.,238,,
1584,0.97,10452.074,10455.244,"If we don't accept it, it doesn't stick around.",238,,
1585,0.97,10455.244,10510.933,"In terms of that, I think there are some components that help protect people who may be newly detained to be sure someone can't overtly do something like that.",238,,
1586,0.97,10510.933,10523.212,"We get a tip saying there's a gray-haired gentleman with a sharp suit wearing a blue tie, there's no personally identifying information.",239,,
1587,0.97,10523.212,10525.982,Same thing happens when the officer gets there.,239,,
1588,0.97,10525.982,10533.422,It speeds it up because they can add the information to the case report and the detective can look at all the evidence.,239,,
1589,0.97,10533.422,10545.968,"In the field, we oftentimes have to wait for a thumb drive and ship it back and forth.",239,,
1590,0.97,10545.968,10550.573,So it has a very good benefit.,239,,
1591,0.97,10550.573,10563.786,"20,000 hours was the assessment of 2018, which is just over a million dollars.",239,,
1592,0.97,10563.786,10574.964,"We could potentially hear the last item, the last technical, and if you still have questions we can come back to it.",240,,
1593,0.97,10574.964,10584.473,"To keep us moving here, if you don't mind, do the last one for us?",240,,
1594,0.97,10584.473,10589.679,It would be approve as the 911 logging recorder.,241,,
1595,0.97,10589.679,10601.958,I think ginger described this as automatically recording all telephone calls between Dispatchers and patrol officers.,241,,
1596,0.97,10601.958,10622.611,"The police Department identified some potential disparate impacts and civil liberties impact, similar to what was identified for the CAD system, possible exposure of personal identifiable information, potential racism.",241,,
1597,0.97,10622.611,10631.42,The public comments received some support for this and concerns were about data use and and sharing.,241,,
1598,0.97,10631.42,10652.074,"The impact assessment issues raised questions about the allowable use of data, data retention and sharing and vendor and third-party contract revisions.",241,,
1599,0.97,10652.074,10657.046,"The policy considerations here, I broke out the considerations here two different ways.",241,,
1600,0.97,10657.046,10678.634,It's basic will I the restrictions op use that we can address and then the same medicine interest in holding vendors accountable to the same policies as the police Department is.,241,,
1601,0.97,10678.634,10688.511,We have already talked about the equity assessments.,241,,
1602,0.97,10688.511,10688.911,Thank you.,242,,
1603,0.97,10688.911,10707.363,"Since we have gotten the presentations today, gotten the Council bills and memos, a lot to go through, Ment we try and get amendments to Lisa over the next week.",242,,
1604,0.97,10707.363,10715.204,Her policy amendment slides are a good place to start.,242,,
1605,0.97,10715.204,10718.974,Information technology like ginger and Amari are available to answer questions.,242,,
1606,0.97,10718.974,10724.447,My staff can be a sounding board as well.,242,,
1607,0.97,10724.447,10740.229,We just want committee members to think of potential amendments so Lee sap has enough time to run them by the city attorney's office and maybe by the city office.,242,,
1608,0.97,10740.229,10750.739,"Since we are at 12:30, I'm just wondering if we have any other questions.",242,,
1609,0.97,10750.739,10751.674,Council member Strauss?,242,,
1610,0.97,10751.674,10753.442,"Thank you, chair Peterson.",243,,
1611,0.97,10753.442,10760.182,Is there a time constraint in which we need to pass these ordinances by?,243,,
1612,0.97,10760.182,10763.886,I see ginger shaking her head no.,243,,
1613,0.97,10763.886,10767.123,I would be happy to discuss with you Offline.,243,,
1614,0.97,10767.123,10771.794,We may have to have another committee meeting before we pass these.,243,,
1615,0.97,10771.794,10784.874,"I've had a number of questions I didn't ask in the interest of time today, Andic diving into these policies more deeply could be helpful for me.",243,,
1616,0.97,10784.874,10795.851,I'll just raise my general questions to each of the five policies: How do we ensure these policies are enforceable?,243,,
1617,0.97,10795.851,10803.759,And I look to see the concerns raised by the working group and the recommendations.,243,,
1618,0.97,10803.759,10826.615,"I want to be sure the concerns have been addressed, because the recommendations are not necessarily the recommendations intended, so I think we may have to walk through that crosswalk.",243,,
1619,0.97,10826.615,10839.962,"Ing for all departments on the line that those are my questions, and up I'm happy to take your direction, Chairer.",243,,
1620,0.97,10839.962,10846.735,"Thank you, council member Strauss.",244,,
1621,0.97,10846.735,10857.279,"Physical your questions are on SPD items, one idea is to move to the items rather than having another committee meeting.",244,,
1622,0.97,10857.279,10883.405,"We'll have another committee meeting about it, but rather than three, push the second one out to give more time for analysis and discussion, pushing it out to the April 7th meeting for the SPD items, for example, just to give everybody more time.",244,,
1623,0.97,10883.405,10898.721,"One of the challenges is because there were 26 Technologies identified and because of the delays on Covid, we are trying to be response Uv to that ordinance, which has deadlines on when they need to be submitted to us.",244,,
1624,0.97,10898.721,10907.863,"We'll hear group three and four technologies, and so we also want to do it right the first time.",244,,
1625,0.97,10907.863,10934.123,"That's one idea, to the hear the city light and fire Department stuff, to vote on it at the next meeting on the 17th and then to give more time--a month--to come here and hear more on the 7th.",244,,
1626,0.97,10934.123,10944.366,"My clerk would probably be kicking me for messing up her schedule, but I hope that works.",244,,
1627,0.97,10944.366,10963.452,"One of my concerns, though, or one of the opportunities of having the committee discussions is that all committee members hear the questions and all departments can answer on the record.",245,,
1628,0.97,10963.452,10970.059,"I think there's a benefit to using committee time, apologies to the director of your committee staff.",245,,
1629,0.97,10970.059,10982.705,"Just flagging that because of the rules, having conversations amongst other Council members and covering ourselves, having it in the open session may be helpful.",245,,
1630,0.97,10982.705,10983.272,Thank you.,246,,
1631,0.97,10983.272,10985.174,Let's think about that.,246,,
1632,0.97,10985.174,10992.247,We have a couple different options we have to consider on how to move forward.,246,,
1633,0.97,10992.247,10993.449,Thanks for considering that.,246,,

1638,0.97,11007.229,11023.612,I know there are more questions as we move toward March 17th and April 7th committees.,248,,
1639,0.97,11023.612,11030.519,Any other comments before we adjourn?,248,,
1640,0.97,11030.519,11031.02,Council member Morales?,248,,
