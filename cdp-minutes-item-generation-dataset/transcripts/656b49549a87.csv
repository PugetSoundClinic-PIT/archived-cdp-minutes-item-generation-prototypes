36,0.97,226.492,235.034,Part of the justifications offered is that India needs to handle a massive problem of illegal Migratio.,3,,
37,0.97,235.034,250.65,"The Indian census indicates this is not the case, but in the interest of time, I will look to the way the National register can be used to strip citizenship even from people born in India, and have lived there their whole lives.",3,,
38,0.97,250.65,253.286,"Unlike the United States, India does not provide automatic citizenship based on birth.",3,,

46,0.97,313.613,327.226,"The ca says, if you are a member of a major religion, recognize that is not Islam, it will become easier and quicker for you to become a naturalized immigrant if you came from Pakistan or Bangladesh.",3,,
47,0.97,327.226,349.949,"Muslims can go elsewhere by virtue of their religion, according to theory, but this does not merely apply to people looking to cross the border, but to Muslims who have lived in India for generations and face additional discrimination on the basis of their religion.",3,,
48,0.97,349.949,360.46,The explanation of the majority religions and for why Sri Lanka and Myanmar have seen religious persecution are not covered by the Caa.,3,,

50,0.97,368.634,374.907,"The difference is the Lautenberg amendment only applies to refugee status, and the function of a legal environment guaranteed birthright citizenship.",3,,
51,0.97,374.907,379.779,The effect of the Caa and Nrcrcaa together results in dissemination.,3,,

60,0.97,431.464,435.835,The first step should be for India to rectify various U.S.,6,,
61,0.97,435.835,440.74,"Entities, like the global compact for migration.",6,,
62,0.97,440.74,452.952,"Caa, when you combine with MRC, the Minister of India has said, multiple times, the nation of citizenship is going to be a lethal weapon.",6,,
63,0.97,452.952,464.764,"The NRC has already been implemented, which left 2 million people out, and out of those 2 million people, I think almost 1.5 million are basically Hindus.",6,,
64,0.97,464.764,475.675,"To rescue those Hindus, to save their own lives, they came up with Caa, so what's going to happen is those half-million people who are Muslims, now they have no place to go to.",6,,
65,0.97,475.675,476.943,Even though the P.A.,6,,
66,0.97,476.943,484.483,"Of India has said it is not attention centered, there are some incentives already.",6,,

393,0.97,2279.043,2281.278,"The second thing is about NRC, detention centers.",72,,
394,0.97,2281.278,2285.149,We heard a lot of stories about detention centers.,72,,
395,0.97,2285.149,2294.425,"You can look at what amnesty report has to say, which is that amnesty International did a report of the NRC, and its implementation.",72,,
396,0.97,2294.425,2298.396,They called it a Biased prejudice.,72,,

417,0.97,2402.299,2403.1,A first very major step.,79,,
418,0.97,2403.1,2416.914,"It Dislodges one of its most important foundations by bringing in a Religious-Based section that is the antithesis of this secular, and Democratic Constitution.",79,,
419,0.97,2416.914,2425.389,"It does that by violating the basic principle of equality before law, excluding one religious minority from its provisions.",79,,
420,0.97,2425.389,2432.029,It undermines the entire edifice of the Constitution in the process.,79,,
421,0.97,2432.029,2441.338,"Conversely, the protesters on the streets are doing much more than resisting one constitutional amendment.",79,,
422,0.97,2441.338,2442.94,All of them articulated that we are not.,79,,
423,0.97,2442.94,2449.613,They are out there in defense of the most basic values of any Republican Constitution and democracy.,79,,

425,0.97,2454.351,2458.823,The Bjp government should shock but not surprised us.,79,,

427,0.97,2470.434,2482.98,They wanted it to be replaced from a Brahmin text that codified extreme caste and gender oppression.,79,,

457,0.97,2658.555,2664.762,"The second stage, name the victim as foreigner.",86,,

467,0.97,2716.98,2718.715,Two thirds come to my mind.,89,,
468,0.97,2718.715,2731.328,"Either the Councilmember is totally ignorant about the matters or falling prey to the misinformation campaign initiated by some Western interests, which I can see here.",89,,
469,0.97,2731.328,2738.035,I emphasize again that Caa has no implication on the existing citizens of India.,89,,
470,0.97,2738.035,2742.339,Irrespective of their religious faith car and belief.,89,,
471,0.97,2742.339,2754.351,"For a cosmopolitan city see like Seattle, which has a history of harmony, the resolution may act as a divisive force.",89,,
472,0.97,2754.351,2762.86,Resolutions also have a detrimental effect in the overall context of into American relations.,89,,
473,0.97,2762.86,2768.132,"I request that the Councilmembers reject this resolution, please.",89,,

480,0.97,2790.287,2791.288,My arguments are as follows.,92,,
481,0.97,2791.288,2795.626,"One, the resolution is out of the Purview of the mission, and function of the Seattle city council.",92,,
482,0.97,2795.626,2801.498,"Two, the resolution is not called for.",92,,
483,0.97,2801.498,2805.836,It is a soft missile attack from the government of Seattle against the government of India.,92,,
484,0.97,2805.836,2816.713,"And has definite consequences of damaging the harmony and peace of the citizens, not only of Seattle, but of India.",92,,
485,0.97,2816.713,2817.314,Number three.,92,,
486,0.97,2817.314,2824.188,It is inappropriate to bundle multiple acts and issues in one resolution.,92,,
487,0.97,2824.188,2825.222,Number four.,92,,
488,0.97,2825.222,2850.047,The resolution has serious and overwhelming color as the proponents of the resolution are giving their concern about the Muslims in India by using $250 million with variations of $50 million in error.,92,,
489,0.97,2850.047,2852.683,They would not allow the counting of the population in India.,92,,

493,0.97,2872.135,2886.183,"For your information, Caa does not take away the citizenship of any Indian citizen, including 200 million Muslim citizens.",94,,
494,0.97,2886.183,2899.296,"I strongly believe, either Councilmember Sawant is totally ignorant about facts or being Misinformed by certain vested interests . I emphasize again, there is no implication on the existing citizens of India irrespective of their religious Úfaith or belief.",94,,
495,0.97,2899.296,2903.734,"Caa is going to help all citizens, not just the minorities of India.",94,,
496,0.97,2903.734,2918.615,"I would strongly urge the city Councilmembers to reject the proposal, which is Factually incorrect, and holds the potential to disrupt the peace of the Indian community residing in this area.",94,,
497,0.97,2918.615,2921.118,I would like to add that Caa and NRC are separate issues.,94,,
498,0.97,2921.118,2925.589,Only the Caa has been adopted as a bill by the Indian Parliament.,94,,
499,0.97,2925.589,2928.025,Please car wrap up.,95,,
500,0.97,2928.025,2932.696,I would strongly urge that you reject the proposal.,96,,

506,0.97,2962.726,2965.762,That's the basic tenant on which the Indian Constitution and Indian democracy was built.,99,,
507,0.97,2965.762,2970.767,This Fascist government of India is trying to change that by bringing in this discriminatory law.,99,,

519,0.97,3024.621,3030.093,It's a combination of this two which will strip Muslims of their citizenship.,101,,

916,0.97,5373.868,5386.381,"I was not on the Council in 2003, but we were shocked to find a 2003 resolution that totally failed to oppose the war in any way, which I think really illustrates how our movement has now, in the current time, moved politics in the city and nationwide.",181,,

954,0.97,5737.832,5766.594,"I believe we could research, review, debate, and vote on a new resolution every hour of every day to counter every bad thing President Trump or his administration does, but every minute as a legislative body we spent researching, writing, reviewing, debating these resolutions is a minute we could spend reducing homelessness, to improve emergency medical response, to ensure we get through dangerous snowstorms.",186,,

970,0.97,5897.258,5903.097,What the resolution does do is empower the movement to keep building.,190,,

1046,0.97,6449.609,6458.185,I just want to point out I have gone through the generals letter.,209,,
1047,0.97,6458.185,6460.754,I am not misguided or Misinformed.,209,,

1052,0.97,6473.567,6483.777,"The most striking thing about Úthat letter, what makes it completely dishonest, and basically useless as it avoids any mention of the National Registry of citizens.",209,,
1053,0.97,6483.777,6495.455,That's for the problem starts and ends.,209,,
1054,0.97,6498.825,6500.527,That's for the crux of the problem lies.,209,,
1055,0.97,6500.527,6501.761,What I want to get to.,209,,
1056,0.97,6501.761,6511.805,"That's the explanation of why Caa and NRC is so bad, and why it's a blatant threat to the citizenship rights of hundreds of millions of Muslims, poor people, indigenous communities, oppressed women, and Lgbtq people.",209,,
1057,0.97,6511.805,6517.41,"I am going to repeat some points I made for the benefit of my colleagues in the morning, but since you're all here, it's important to share this.",209,,
1058,0.97,6517.41,6520.213,The National register of citizens came long before the citizenship amendment act even existed.,209,,
1059,0.97,6520.213,6522.482,There was no citizenship amendment act first.,209,,
1060,0.97,6522.482,6523.984,There was a Registry of citizens.,209,,
1061,0.97,6523.984,6530.257,"This requires that every person in India produce proof of citizenship, but not a passport.",209,,
1062,0.97,6530.257,6530.69,Nothing like that.,209,,
1063,0.97,6530.69,6534.828,A new set of criteria have been devised by the NRC.,209,,
1064,0.97,6534.828,6540.734,"The NRC was tried out in one state, a Psalm, which some others have mentioned.",209,,
1065,0.97,6540.734,6542.469,The documents required under the National Registry of citizens.,209,,
1066,0.97,6542.469,6544.037,I wanted to read back.,209,,

1069,0.97,6559.92,6560.921,Think about the,209,,
1070,0.97,6560.921,6563.723,I was born after 1971.,210,,
1071,0.97,6563.723,6568.929,"I have none of those documents, so technically, I would not get citizenship.",210,,
1072,0.97,6568.929,6579.172,I would be rejected as a citizen in India.,210,,
1073,0.97,6579.172,6579.773,I wont be affected.,210,,
1074,0.97,6579.773,6580.173,Why?,210,,
1075,0.97,6580.173,6604.431,"Because when they saw the NRC disastrous effects where Hindus were falling into the Noncitizen category, they immediately had to act, and make something happen so that Hindus were not unintentionally getting caught because their intention was to put Muslims in the Noncitizen category, so they quickly came up with a citizenship amendment act, which basically says, if you have a Hindu name, you don't have to provide documentation.",210,,
1076,0.97,6604.431,6612.272,"Because I come from a Hindu family even without documentation, I am all set.",210,,
1077,0.97,6612.272,6613.006,I will get citizenship.,210,,
1078,0.97,6613.006,6614.941,Those of you who are Muslim will not get citizenship.,210,,
1079,0.97,6614.941,6624.517,"Not only that, if you can't provide the documentation as a Muslim, or as a person of other religion, whatever, then you are facing the prospect of Detention centers or presence.",210,,
1080,0.97,6624.517,6625.552,"Again, this is not speculative.",210,,
1081,0.97,6625.552,6626.987,This is actually happening in a Psalm.,210,,
1082,0.97,6626.987,6630.657,"We have seen 2 million people become stateless, be declared stateless.",210,,
1083,0.97,6630.657,6633.059,Many of them are languishing in detention centers.,210,,
1084,0.97,6633.059,6637.03,"People said, little children are dying.",210,,
1085,0.97,6637.03,6644.337,"Protest has been happening to the nation starting on university campuses, but now they are all over the country.",210,,

1087,0.97,6650.443,6654.547,We have seen massive actions.,210,,
1088,0.97,6654.547,6670.563,I wanted to quickly read out a message of solidarity that are not a Roy has sent to me personally on the solution.,210,,
1089,0.97,6670.563,6671.431,It's very brief.,210,,
1090,0.97,6671.431,6682.742,"It says,"" the Indian government citizenship American act resembles the Nuremberg citizenship laws of the third Reich.",210,,
1091,0.97,6682.742,6695.889,"They could generate panic, uncontrollable calf, and a population of stateless people on an unimaginable scale.",210,,
1092,0.97,6699.259,6703.463,"In the state of his home alone, pending the last round of Appeals, the number is close to 2 million.",210,,
1093,0.97,6703.463,6706.166,The government must be prevailed upon to repeal these laws as quickly as possible.,210,,
1094,0.97,6706.166,6709.436,I support Councilmember Sawant's resolution and hope others around the world will follow its examples.,210,,
1095,0.97,6709.436,6717.711,I am also happy to say the Lgbtq Commission voted unanimously to support this resolution and we will make sure other comments councils follow.,210,,
1096,0.97,6717.711,6722.282,We also have Cair give us solidarity.,210,,
1097,0.97,6722.282,6734.527,"There are hundreds not necessarily under any group, but they are organizing together, and it's all the way from Tech workers to less paid workers, to small business owners, who are all coming together.",210,,
1098,0.97,6734.527,6736.229,This last point I wanted to make.,210,,
1099,0.97,6736.229,6747.14,"The people who are supporting Lander Modi who say or motive is divisive, it's the opposite.",210,,
1100,0.97,6747.14,6750.343,"It's the citizenship act that is deeply divisive, and the Registry that is divisive.",210,,
1101,0.97,6750.343,6760.82,I wanted to quote the last.,210,,
1102,0.97,6763.022,6765.725,The one thing that can be said for the authors of these vicious laws.,210,,
1103,0.97,6765.725,6768.461,They have succeeded in uniting countless people across the length of the land.,210,,
1104,0.97,6768.461,6775.635,Many are out there showing the world what democracy is all about.,210,,
1105,0.97,6775.635,6776.636,Let's remember these encouraging words.,210,,

1119,0.97,6855.815,6857.45,I want to comment.,213,,
1120,0.97,6857.45,6883.443,"I think the Iran resolution we passed earlier is a good example of this, that while I think on occasion, we can or should comment on international relations, I think it's most proper to instruct our congressional delegation or instruct the Federal authorities in our system that have the power to take action, most immediately on addressing these concerns.",213,,
1121,0.97,6883.443,6897.49,"I think we have a strong partner with Congresswoman Camilla Jayapal, who has taken leadership on this issue.",213,,

1126,0.97,6935.695,6938.498,"The process we went through with the Iran resolution produced a stronger resolution, I think.",213,,
1127,0.97,6938.498,6944.537,"I don't think delaying, for a little bit of time, especially on issues I am not personally, at this moment, a proficient expert in without further deliberation and consultation.",213,,
1128,0.97,6944.537,6949.242,I have the humility to recognize that.,213,,
1129,0.97,6949.242,6953.146,I don't think that is going to make the final product suffer.,213,,
