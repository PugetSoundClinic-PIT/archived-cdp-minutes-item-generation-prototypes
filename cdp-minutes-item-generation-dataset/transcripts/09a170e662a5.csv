99,0.7961719036102295,349.5,356.8,And so there are convenient competing demands for rooftop spaces and that is intention somewhat with,,,

110,0.9128385782241821,399.0,399.8,All right.,,,
111,0.781995415687561,401.9,405.0, I will move to the first slide.,,,
112,0.781995415687561,405.5,407.2,So what does this relate to?,,,
113,0.781995415687561,408.8,424.1,"As Keitel said, it does relate to the adoption and effective this year, energy code updates that will address space Heating and water heating and new buildings.",,,
114,0.781995415687561,425.3,430.7,And what we'd like to do is coordinate the Ladies Code regulations with the new.,,,
115,0.8601705431938171,430.9,443.9," Energy code requirements to avoid any conflicts or hampered ability to meet both codes, since we are looking at some complex code here.",,,
116,0.8601705431938171,443.9,460.1,We'd like to simplify the language as possible and clarify what's accounted for the rooftop requirement in each Zone and we've made a fair amount of progress on that and also as a as a side,,,
117,0.9073192477226257,460.8,489.6, topic here later in our process that the ideas for amending rooftop use allowances and Pioneer Square came along and we took a look at that vetted it and propose something that would address newly allowing lodging uses and dining uses on the rooftops of buildings in Pioneer Square and similarly for the Chinatown ID neighborhood.,,,
118,0.9073192477226257,489.6,490.8,We looked,,,
119,0.9128383994102478,491.1,499.1, Comparatively more constrained list of changes relating to increasing the roof coverage percentage limit.,,,
120,0.9128383994102478,499.2,510.9,"And then also clarifying a new note, about greenhouses as a rooftop, use that have been allowed but what wasn't stated clearly for that capability.",,,
121,0.8769562244415283,514.2,543.6," So, just briefly to summarize key points about how the Ladies Code treats rooftop features height, the height limit of a building of the Zone tight when that is measured to the roofs surface level, and many things above up to 4, feet above the roof are easily allowed like parapets and you know, commonly present items that that are that are low are not limited in that.",,,
122,0.83267742395401,544.0,549.3, Space between 4 feet and 15 feet is kind of another category.,,,
123,0.83267742395401,549.4,566.1,"Generally more taller features that the code wants to allow, but also put set some limits, which are generally about percentage coverage of the roof and things like that, proximity to the edge of the roof.",,,
124,0.8374788165092468,567.2,567.7, Elevator.,,,
125,0.8374788165092468,567.7,570.0,"Penthouse, is that can be keto mentioned.",,,
126,0.8374788165092468,570.3,582.0,"We have some varying allowances for how tall those can be by the roof, but they range from 16 feet, to 35 feet, above the roof, or even 45 feet in a special case in a certain Zone.",,,
127,0.8374788165092468,583.2,589.4,"And then, as I mentioned, taller features are limited to a certain percent of coverage of the roof.",,,
128,0.8546490669250488,591.9,596.3, So moving on to a quick summary of the main elements of change.,,,
129,0.8546490669250488,596.8,614.9,"We have increased percent coverage with these rooftop features for the taller items, generally in the range of 10 to 15 percent increases across, almost every Zone in the city and the column and left their summarizes.",,,
130,0.8546490669250488,614.9,618.6,"The the proposed,",,,
131,0.8046119213104248,619.7,638.3," Rooftop coverage for percents for these zones, it varies from the lower density zones around, 30% coverage, up to about 75 percent coverage for certain kinds of downtown residential towers and 50% coverage for other features.",,,
132,0.8046119213104248,638.3,647.5,Other downtown buildings with these features and then in Pioneer Square in Chinatown zones that are distinct in downtown.,,,
133,0.8046119213104248,648.0,649.4,They generally have a lower,,,
134,0.8982172012329102,649.5,663.9," Average allowed today, but we would propose to bump those up about 10% in those own categories and it reflects just a greater sensitivity to the historic character of those neighborhoods.",,,
135,0.8982172012329102,666.1,672.6,"And so, another objective of the changes is to increase the consistency in the rooftop limits.",,,
136,0.8982172012329102,674.2,676.4,We have many more zones.,,,
137,0.8982172012329102,676.4,679.3,These days that have buildings that can reach,,,
138,0.788356602191925,680.6,688.4," to or above 120 feet in height in zones, including mid-rise high-rise commercial neighborhood commercial.",,,
139,0.788356602191925,688.7,696.2,"And also there's several newer kinds of Seattle mix zones that have come around since we've really updated these, rooftop Rags.",,,
140,0.788356602191925,696.2,709.3,"So particularly in downtown, there's an interest in accommodating these to recognize that the",,,
141,0.8785943388938904,709.6,721.8, The smaller residential Towers tend to have a limited for plate and therefore there's less space on the roof to serve to put all the equipment that needs to be there to serve the residential units.,,,
142,0.8785943388938904,723.2,734.1,"And just noting here that we do have a second option for Architects to use in their sign of their buildings, particularly in the Seattle mix Zone, where we allow up to 75 percent coverage.",,,
143,0.8785943388938904,734.1,735.0,No zones.,,,
144,0.8785943388938904,735.6,739.1,"Generally, if the rooftop features are grouped toward the middle of the roof.",,,
145,0.9071111083030701,739.6,754.8," And we're proposing, you know to limit the height of features near the roof edges and extend that kind of option to high rhizomes commercial and neighbor commercial and and and Seattle mix zones.",,,
146,0.9071111083030701,754.8,755.3,Currently.,,,
147,0.9071111083030701,755.3,758.6,That's only applicable to South Lake Union.,,,
148,0.9071111083030701,759.1,767.5,So moving on to try and Pioneer Square.,,,
149,0.9071111083030701,767.9,768.7,The the,,,
150,0.7277687191963196,769.4,774.8, A summary version of what the changes here are that we would newly.,,,
151,0.7277687191963196,774.8,784.1,Allow these kinds of pet house uses on rooftops in these Pioneer Square zones that this could happen on buildings at least 40 feet tall.,,,

170,0.7660454511642456,935.3,941.9,If there's a reason other restaurant districts were not included and what restrictions exist in other parts of the city.,,,

173,0.7548452019691467,950.7,952.3,Is that what your question is about?,,,
174,0.7548452019691467,952.3,952.6,Or,,,

176,0.5604098439216614,954.0,954.3,Yeah.,,,
177,0.7743333578109741,959.9,961.4, That's one's going to be hard to lose.,,,
178,0.7743333578109741,962.5,965.7,Was your question about other neighborhoods or just downtown?,,,
179,0.7743333578109741,965.8,966.1,Okay.,,,
180,0.7743333578109741,966.4,978.9,"So Gordon, I think the question this bill is bringing into line, downtown regulations with Pioneer Square in possibly, China Town, International District.",,,
181,0.7743333578109741,979.0,981.9,Is there a potential reason or not?,,,
182,0.7743333578109741,981.9,985.7,A reason to expand this to other neighborhoods and zones across the city?,,,
183,0.9128385782241821,988.1,989.5, That is a good question.,,,
184,0.8916777968406677,991.9,1020.4," I think in general the, the outlook for rooftop coverage, in many other zones would be that that if assuming they include some residential uses that there would be quite a bit of coverage used by other features like mechanical features and perhaps the penthouse has and other things like that.",,,
185,0.8916777968406677,1020.4,1021.0,That would really,,,
186,0.9117825031280518,1021.7,1025.8, Consume a lot of the available roof coverage.,,,
187,0.9117825031280518,1026.4,1035.7,"And and so, there wouldn't necessarily be a natural fit with newly allowing that in especially in a low-rise Zone.",,,
188,0.9117825031280518,1035.7,1045.4,"But in a commercial Zone, I think that again, it's sort of a, it doesn't necessarily relate.",,,
189,0.9117825031280518,1045.4,1050.1,"Well, to probable new buildings and in commercial zones, either.",,,
190,0.8645401000976562,1052.1,1053.2, Sort of Target.,,,
191,0.8645401000976562,1053.4,1056.6,"If your question is in other zones, is it a lot?",,,
192,0.8645401000976562,1057.0,1057.2,Does?,,,
193,0.8645401000976562,1057.2,1060.4,The city authorized eating and drinking establishments on rooftops?,,,
194,0.8645401000976562,1060.8,1061.9,"Generally, the answer to that.",,,
195,0.8645401000976562,1061.9,1069.5,"Question is yes, Pioneer Square and the ID are somewhat of an exception because they are historic districts.",,,
196,0.8645401000976562,1069.5,1081.8,"And as a consequence of had a stricter set of limitations imposed, but generally throughout most of downtown and other Urban centers and mixed use",,,
197,0.8869762420654297,1082.0,1089.0," As rooftop decks, we've got beating a big drinking establishments are allowed uses.",,,
198,0.8869762420654297,1089.9,1095.8,"Yeah, and you could say that the downtown Zone has layers of added information in it.",,,
199,0.8869762420654297,1095.8,1101.2,"So, because there was a an indication about office and residential uses on the roof.",,,
200,0.8869762420654297,1101.5,1107.7,"If we want to allow other kinds, we should add that specifically to the downtown code.",,,
201,0.8869762420654297,1107.7,1111.1,"So that it is, it is addressed rather than",,,
202,0.9128385782241821,1112.0,1112.8, Omitted.,,,
203,0.9120097756385803,1115.3,1122.5," So the second part of my question was, what restrictions exist in other parts of the city, is the answer to that.",,,
204,0.9120097756385803,1122.5,1127.8,There are no restrictions in other parts of the city or there are some,,,
205,0.8888853788375854,1130.7,1136.0," Answer that is that there are some, there's some rooftop limitations on the amount of coverage that might apply.",,,
206,0.8888853788375854,1136.8,1145.3,But they're not specific limitations on uses for the most part and other zones where lodging and eating and drinking establishments are allowed.,,,
207,0.8888853788375854,1145.6,1147.1,So there is some variability.,,,
208,0.8888853788375854,1147.1,1154.3,"But for instance, if you think about Belltown, for example, there are hotels, nutritional tell Isabel towns that have rooftop bars.",,,
209,0.8888853788375854,1155.2,1160.2,"So in places like that, there's not the same kind of limitation that applies in our",,,
210,0.8699302077293396,1160.5,1161.0, Districts.,,,
211,0.8699302077293396,1162.2,1169.1,"And then my last question is, could you talk a little bit more about the stakeholders that were involved in developing these updates?",,,
212,0.8960314393043518,1172.0,1184.0," For, for Pioneer Square in particular, we presented to the board about the ideas.",,,
213,0.8960314393043518,1184.0,1186.4,We worked with the Department of neighborhoods.,,,
214,0.8960314393043518,1186.8,1191.5,We had some feedback from the alliance for Pioneer Square and Eugenia.,,,
215,0.8960314393043518,1191.5,1201.6,"Woo, wrote in as well, commenting and click, you know, participating in the meeting that we had with the board.",,,
216,0.9128386378288269,1202.6,1215.7," So in terms of evaluating that it was, it was that a cross, you know, a spectrum of neighborhood stakeholders.",,,
217,0.9128385782241821,1221.1,1226.6," And as far as other areas of town, we did.",,,
218,0.8196969628334045,1228.6,1242.9," Seek to engage with the Seattle Chamber group interested in land, use issues and a reach out to a couple of other similar groups and we briefed we preach them and got their feedback.",,,
219,0.8196969628334045,1244.1,1252.1,And also we worked with we briefed the to the construction Advisory Board.,,,
220,0.8809998631477356,1253.6,1263.7," The sea cab much earlier and they understood and more generally accepting of the, of the need for the changes.",,,
221,0.8216215968132019,1267.4,1271.2," Wonderful, counselor mosquito to any more question.",,,
222,0.8216215968132019,1271.2,1272.0,You're good to go.,,,
223,0.8216215968132019,1272.0,1273.8,And actually you asked all my questions.,,,
224,0.8216215968132019,1273.8,1274.4,Wonderful.,,,
225,0.8216215968132019,1274.6,1276.1,I have no more questions.,,,
226,0.8216215968132019,1276.1,1277.9,"I might have, I do have one more question.",,,
227,0.8216215968132019,1277.9,1280.6,"I see councilmember Nelson, has some salt, let her go first.",,,
228,0.8216215968132019,1281.5,1283.5,So just just to be clear.,,,
229,0.8216215968132019,1283.5,1284.3,It's not.,,,
230,0.8216215968132019,1284.8,1295.1,"So this is not just referring to, obviously amenities, you know, things over barbecue areas or whatever on roofs.",,,
231,0.8216215968132019,1295.1,1297.0,It also has to do with mechanical.,,,
232,0.7488887310028076,1298.4,1300.3," Yes, so and I remember back in the day.",,,
233,0.7488887310028076,1300.3,1305.0,"We were all, you know, the tall skinny residential Tower was all the rage.",,,
234,0.7488887310028076,1305.0,1311.9,"And so it looks as though this is trying to accommodate the the smaller floor plate of tall, residential Towers.",,,
235,0.7488887310028076,1311.9,1315.0,But so I'm supportive of that effort.,,,
236,0.7488887310028076,1315.0,1324.1,I'm wondering the limits between downtown and the International District.,,,
237,0.7488887310028076,1324.1,1325.6,They're pretty close together.,,,
238,0.7488887310028076,1325.6,1326.6,"And so,",,,
239,0.9128382802009583,1327.3,1332.1, why why the the for the same height of building?,,,
240,0.9128382802009583,1333.1,1348.2,"Why would the percentage of coverage in somebody just mentioned historic neighborhood, but presumably the actual that has teams who design review anyway, so so why couldn't it just be the same coverage?",,,
241,0.9128382802009583,1350.0,1351.3,That's a good question.,,,
242,0.9128382802009583,1352.1,1355.4,I think that the rooftop coverage.,,,
243,0.8010231256484985,1356.3,1373.8," Limits that we have for Pioneer Square in Chinatown ID were mostly defined for the context of what can happen on existing buildings, historic buildings, and there's an interest in helping the visual changes from any renovation.",,,
244,0.8010231256484985,1373.8,1386.0,On those buildings from not detracting from the historic character of those buildings and similarly for Chinatown to relate as best as possible.,,,
245,0.9025278687477112,1386.0,1391.5," To the character of the China Town, International District, in its built environment.",,,
246,0.9025278687477112,1391.5,1400.1,"So one thing that has happened in the meantime, is that about 12 years ago.",,,
247,0.9025278687477112,1400.1,1416.0,We rezoned parts of Chinatown ID and newly added a capability for the Slimmer Towers particularly in places north of Jackson Street and also south southern half of the,,,
248,0.7046892642974854,1416.0,1437.2," Of the Chinatown ID Corso, as written work today, the lower limits, apply to even newer buildings in those zones and we hadn't proposed to define a new limit for that class of buildings so far.",,,
249,0.9122164845466614,1438.8,1448.6, And and it is arguable as to whether those limits that we have are enough to serve the new buildings per se.,,,
250,0.9122164845466614,1449.4,1449.7,Right.,,,
251,0.9122164845466614,1449.7,1454.9,"Well, I see so I guess I'm saying that good that were upping the limits.",,,
252,0.9122164845466614,1454.9,1465.2,"But I think that rationally, if we allow for greater height, we should allow for the same coverage on the same height of building because it's really about the mechanical.",,,
253,0.9122164845466614,1465.4,1467.0,We're not talking about extras here.,,,
254,0.9122164845466614,1467.0,1468.1,We're talking about the mechanics.,,,
255,0.9065897464752197,1468.3,1469.8," Equipment, so right.",,,
256,0.9065897464752197,1472.2,1483.6,"Well, they I don't know if yeah, if this constitutes an amendment to this legislation or a separate piece of legislation, it's just that we should allow these buildings to function as their intended and we want more housing and in tide is there then why not?",,,
257,0.9065897464752197,1483.8,1492.3,"Yeah Nelson, maybe let me get to my questions because I think some of my questions might answer which are the central staff.",,,
258,0.9065897464752197,1492.3,1494.3,Memo lists three potential amendments.,,,
259,0.9065897464752197,1494.3,1494.9,Mr. Freeman.,,,
260,0.9065897464752197,1494.9,1496.7,Could you briefly describe those to us?,,,
261,0.7929173707962036,1498.2,1505.3, I know that I have interested in sponsoring these just waiting on some last stakeholder Outreach that.,,,
262,0.7929173707962036,1505.3,1506.2,I want to make sure we do.,,,
263,0.7929173707962036,1506.2,1510.8,But there are three potential amendments that are identified in the center staff memo.,,,
264,0.7929173707962036,1510.8,1518.4,"And after they've today's public hearing and are you may hear from constituents between now and the next meeting, we may identify additional amendments.",,,
265,0.7929173707962036,1518.4,1523.0,But there are at least three that we know about so far as DC is identified.,,,
266,0.7929173707962036,1523.1,1527.7,What is largely a technical amendment of clarification since,,,
267,0.8141294717788696,1528.2,1529.4, Implementation of their my cherry.,,,
268,0.8141294717788696,1529.4,1533.9,We have a new height datum that applies in a lot of our commercial zones.,,,
269,0.8141294717788696,1533.9,1538.0,"It's a 55 foot, height, limit the language in Council 120.",,,
270,0.8141294717788696,1538.0,1540.7,287 dozens would have clearly contemplate that height by Matt.,,,
271,0.8141294717788696,1540.7,1549.3,"So there is an amendment to clarify that that was identified by Gordon and planned, reviewers that STI.",,,
272,0.8141294717788696,1549.6,1552.8,There are also two amendments that I think are come from Nelson.,,,
273,0.8141294717788696,1552.8,1557.8,I may be speaking to that have been identified by Weber Thompson.,,,
274,0.8870076537132263,1558.2,1562.3, Which is helping design a project in the International District.,,,
275,0.8870076537132263,1562.7,1567.6,And those those amendments would allow higher Heights for elevator penthouses.,,,
276,0.8870076537132263,1567.6,1570.5,So for elevator overruns to accommodate faster.,,,
277,0.8870076537132263,1570.5,1581.5,"Elevators, and also do a councilmember Nelson is describing which has allowed greater rooftop coverage that were consistent with what we allow other sort of downtown zones and Seattle.",,,
278,0.8870076537132263,1581.5,1587.8,Mix sounds like in South Lake Union so that there can be a higher percent of the towers.,,,
279,0.8854907751083374,1588.0,1597.7, Sure that is covered by mechanical equipment or the rooftop features because that Tower is beating our Urban design standards for what point size.,,,
280,0.8854907751083374,1597.7,1602.9,"So, those are three amendments that have been identified and the staff is reviewing again.",,,
281,0.8854907751083374,1602.9,1605.5,There may be others that come for between now and the 11th.,,,

857,0.756587564945221,5084.2,5090.4, Recruiter directors in Cory and Nick great great work there.,,,

861,0.912838876247406,5098.1,5103.1," When off the, I mean you didn't have it written as text on the slides and you answered those questions.",,,
862,0.912838876247406,5103.1,5110.7,"And some things, I'd like to highlight about is accountability to community the ability where you're not, just asking a question.",,,
863,0.912838876247406,5110.7,5122.1,"Once you're coming back to see, if you've actually addressed the issue accountability, within your own organization, when things don't happen correctly or bad things occur, you have accountability with your teams.",,,
864,0.912838876247406,5122.5,5125.6,And then also the hiring aspects.,,,
865,0.912838876247406,5125.6,5127.8,I think really highlighting the fact that,,,
866,0.8847418427467346,5128.3,5136.4, Somebody can have four years of experience and they might know the job better than somebody who has a four-year degree in the field.,,,
867,0.8847418427467346,5136.8,5142.7,"And that, that understanding is really spot on so many more things to highlight.",,,
868,0.8847418427467346,5142.7,5146.9,"I see, I've got some cash some colleagues in line vice-chair Morales.",,,

873,0.8707528114318848,5157.0,5177.2,"And I think, you know, to me really demonstrates that you have clearly understood that there is a lot of work to do here to understand what racial Equity means and the work that this city really has to do to achieve racial equity and to and to hold departments accountable.",,,
874,0.8707528114318848,5177.6,5179.7,I haven't seen a lot of,,,
875,0.9128384590148926,5180.2,5183.0," R. SJ presentations from other departments, yet.",,,
876,0.9128384590148926,5183.3,5186.1,I know everybody's working on getting them presented.,,,
877,0.9128384590148926,5186.3,5192.1,I hope other departments are diving as deep as you seem to be so.,,,
878,0.9128384590148926,5192.4,5193.7,So I want to thank you for that.,,,
879,0.9128384590148926,5196.2,5201.2,I wanted to just comment on a couple of things and then I'll hand it over.,,,
880,0.9128384590148926,5202.3,5209.4,"So particularly as it relates to the comp plan, you know, it sounds like some of the values and some of the",,,
881,0.7667143940925598,5210.0,5215.5, the direction that you're trying to move is to make the language more plain spoken.,,,
882,0.7667143940925598,5215.8,5218.6,So I'm really excited to hear about that.,,,
883,0.7667143940925598,5218.7,5220.8,Authentic engagement with community.,,,
884,0.7667143940925598,5221.1,5236.1,"And I think what I heard you say as well is clarity about for community members about how their input will be used in in drafting, and in making decisions or how it won't be.",,,
885,0.7667143940925598,5236.4,5239.7,I think that's equally important as we're asking people to commit their time.,,,
886,0.9128382205963135,5239.8,5244.3, Men and donate their expertise to these conversations coming up.,,,
887,0.9128382205963135,5244.9,5249.7,I think we do need to be really clear with folks about whether this is to what degree.,,,
888,0.9128382205963135,5249.7,5254.7,This input will be used to influence our decisions.,,,
889,0.9128382205963135,5256.4,5258.9,So just a couple more things.,,,
890,0.9128382205963135,5259.4,5269.5,"I want to remind colleagues, and I appreciate you mentioning, you know, not just the impact that department work has on community.",,,
891,0.9085788130760193,5270.7,5282.1," But also the impacts for the interpersonal work environment, because all of that affects somebody's ability to do their job on behalf of community and to be a public servant.",,,
892,0.9085788130760193,5283.1,5294.9,"And so, I just want to remind colleagues again that just last summer, we had seven black women allege discrimination in salary and promotion with the city.",,,
893,0.9085788130760193,5294.9,5299.3,And so I'm really glad to hear about the pay Equity issues that you've,,,
894,0.9128385782241821,5300.7,5303.6, And some of the workplace other workplace issues.,,,
895,0.9128385782241821,5304.9,5328.2,"We are also hearing about a possible need for the city classification system, to be changed to address some of the things that you're talking about old requirements for Education versus lived experience, for example, and then the last thing I want to say is that in order for all of us to do our work to serve our constituents at to serve our city.",,,
896,0.9128385782241821,5328.3,5329.6,We all have to be,,,
897,0.8782459497451782,5330.6,5332.9, Aware of what racial Equity means.,,,
898,0.8782459497451782,5332.9,5334.8,And I'm glad that we're doing this.,,,
899,0.8782459497451782,5334.8,5343.4,"Kind of work to understand that what we're doing really needs to be rooted in dignity, in the next week or two.",,,
900,0.8782459497451782,5344.1,5351.4,I think several of us have been invited by King County councilmember Larry Gossett to a conversation about reparations.,,,
901,0.8782459497451782,5352.7,5359.4,"And so I'm really, as we're thinking about, you know, our built environment, the work that we have to do in our built environment.",,,
902,0.8782459497451782,5359.4,5359.7,It really,,,
903,0.9054203629493713,5359.8,5367.8, Should be about advancing these movements toward transformative Justice and atoning.,,,
904,0.9054203629493713,5367.8,5370.7,For these racist land use policies that we have had.,,,
905,0.9054203629493713,5370.7,5381.7,"And you know, I'm really starting to go into these next conversations with a lot of questions about what it means for us, as a city to think, critically.",,,
906,0.9054203629493713,5381.7,5388.3,And to think seriously about reparations for people who continue to be impacted by the legacy of racism.,,,
907,0.9054203629493713,5388.3,5388.7,And,,,
908,0.8967769742012024,5389.7,5391.8," Sure how it's reflected in our land, use code.",,,
909,0.8967769742012024,5391.8,5405.4,"So all that, just to say, I really appreciate all the work that you have done to get to this point and look forward to working with all of you to make sure that we're acting on the work that you've done here.",,,
910,0.8967769742012024,5405.7,5412.2,"Thank you, Vice chair and just to clarify those seven complaints last year, were not within either of these two departments.",,,
911,0.8967769742012024,5412.2,5413.6,Is that is correct.,,,
912,0.8967769742012024,5413.6,5414.6,That is correct.,,,

921,0.804722011089325,5433.2,5434.2,So thank you very much.,,,
922,0.804722011089325,5434.2,5435.6,And I really appreciate that.,,,
923,0.804722011089325,5435.6,5440.7,You lay out the actual policy implications for the work that you've done.,,,
924,0.804722011089325,5440.7,5446.3,"So on page, on slide 18, there were a couple in the draft.",,,
925,0.804722011089325,5446.3,5453.4,"Yeah, so as economic development chair, I'm really interested in more well-paid jobs for workers of color.",,,
926,0.804722011089325,5454.0,5457.0,"And then also, I'm interested in",,,

928,0.8468486070632935,5460.5,5467.4,"And so these have really there are overlaps between your department and oh, Edie.",,,
929,0.8468486070632935,5467.4,5476.0,And I think that we should make sure this is a statement of principle that a lot of these efforts that happen in a siloed fashion from Department.,,,
930,0.8468486070632935,5476.0,5488.3,"Department should also reinforce each other but my point is these are draft and I understand that you will take them out to community for validation, but you might have said when you thought you might get that back.",,,
931,0.7697500586509705,5488.4,5488.5, Back.,,,
932,0.7697500586509705,5488.5,5491.3,"And when they might not be draft anymore, but could you tell me?",,,
933,0.7697500586509705,5491.4,5492.1,Could you say it again?,,,
934,0.8714139461517334,5494.3,5497.7, I didn't count for nothing.,,,

939,0.8714139461517334,5514.9,5518.2,"What the, with a comprehensive plan major update.",,,
940,0.8714139461517334,5518.3,5523.3,We're in the first of five discrete phases of,,,
941,0.8923735022544861,5523.9,5526.3, The work over the course of the next three years.,,,
942,0.8923735022544861,5527.4,5536.5,"And I think that in this first phase, we haven't wanted to be defensive about when when Joe for the racial Equity outcomes.",,,
943,0.8923735022544861,5536.7,5539.1,When do they move from draft to final?,,,
944,0.8923735022544861,5539.1,5553.5,"And I think that part of the feedback that we got from Community is that we have in more than one occasion, like, moved too quickly, so I don't have a hard and fast State Freeway.",,,
945,0.9017047882080078,5553.9,5567.2," For when the, I mean, I do believe that as we have a communal conversation that the bullet points that you see in that the mat slide are valid and meaningful.",,,
946,0.9017047882080078,5567.7,5574.0,"I think the part of the reason that you still see traffic on that was because I think that we're asking myself, the question are there more?",,,
947,0.9017047882080078,5574.8,5577.0,"And what, how much specificity wanted to do.",,,
948,0.9017047882080078,5577.0,5583.2,"We want to be at this level versus, you know, some of the policy implications and I",,,

952,0.8130263090133667,5603.8,5609.8,"I'm what I'm trying to put an emphasis on, as we do this comp plan is how do we",,,
953,0.7589436173439026,5610.8,5616.8," How do we write a plan that helps City departments, think about implementation?",,,
954,0.7589436173439026,5618.2,5621.9,"And that's in the end, you know, as I mean because these are all outcome-based.",,,
955,0.7589436173439026,5621.9,5624.5,"Like, we can say, whatever we want in the plan.",,,
956,0.7589436173439026,5624.5,5634.3,"But if, if there's not by understanding of how it informs work, plans of the Department's at won't have the value that we really needed to.",,,
957,0.7589436173439026,5634.6,5638.0,"And I think it's important, that that community in being involved.",,,
958,0.7589436173439026,5638.0,5640.4,In the process that people see themselves.,,,
959,0.6943042874336243,5640.6,5649.4, Scan it and therefore will pull it up because it is holding them up when we actually implement.,,,
960,0.8831163644790649,5651.2,5653.2," Okay, I will respect the process.",,,
