140,0.97,718.25,720.72,"Good afternoon, everyone, my name is Sara ward.",32,,
141,0.97,720.72,721.454,And I'm an attorney.,32,,
142,0.97,721.454,724.623,And I've been a Seattle resident for over ten years.,32,,
143,0.97,724.623,729.895,I'm here today to express my support for initiative 134 too.,32,,
144,0.97,729.895,733.032,I'm a volunteer with Seattle APPROVES.,32,,
145,0.97,733.032,737.803,And I help get this initiative on the ballot with a team of other great volunteers.,32,,
146,0.97,737.803,749.849,I got involved in this in 2021 because if passed this change will help ensure that everyone in Seattle has a voice in our elections.,32,,
147,0.97,749.849,767.299,"In addition to my day job as a lawyer, I volunteered to support folks who help--who want to vacate their criminal records on a pro Bono basis in partnership with the urban League, civil survivor, and the public defender Association.",32,,
148,0.97,767.299,773.139,I also have helped to raise funds for the social justice fund Northwest.,32,,
149,0.97,773.139,774.14,And the giving project.,32,,
150,0.97,774.14,777.643,So I'm really involved in the community.,32,,
151,0.97,777.643,787.286,"And I really believe that 134 will ensure that everyone in Seattle can express their preferences, including under represented groups.",32,,
152,0.97,787.286,793.959,"This change is also really important to me because it's inherently nonpartisan, it's candidate neutral.",32,,
153,0.97,793.959,800.332,"And it's really one of the very few reforms, I think, that doesn't try to help or harm anyone.",32,,
154,0.97,800.332,803.702,And that everyone should be able to get behind.,32,,
155,0.97,803.702,807.84,It just makes elections function the way we all believe they should.,32,,
156,0.97,807.84,812.244,Candidates who are supported by the most voters are the ones who win.,32,,
157,0.97,812.244,823.522,"And then Lastly, I want to mention that Washington state law requires that Seattle hold a primary election and then a top two run off and this change is Skippet with that requirement.",32,,
158,0.97,823.522,832.131,So I'm super excited that this simple change will create the most representative elections possible within state law today.,32,,
159,0.97,832.131,835.935,Thank you for sending I 134 on to voters.,32,,

165,0.97,852.751,856.322,Please press Star six.,33,,
166,0.97,856.322,856.689,Hi.,34,,
167,0.97,856.689,856.922,Sorry.,34,,
168,0.97,856.922,857.957,I was coming off mute.,34,,
169,0.97,857.957,862.328,Can you hear me now?,34,,
170,0.97,862.328,862.561,Yep.,35,,
171,0.97,862.561,863.329,Good afternoon.,36,,
172,0.97,863.329,866.865,My name is Malorie rush.,36,,
173,0.97,866.865,878.911,I'm calling from St. Louis where I was team manager for our own approval voting initiative back in 2019.,36,,
174,0.97,878.911,883.482,Our initiative adopted approval voting for our primary elections in St. Louis.,36,,
175,0.97,883.482,890.522,And I am excited that Seattle is weighing this improvement as well.,36,,
176,0.97,890.522,898.397,Our initiative was on the ballot back in 2019 and passed with a really incredible 68% support.,36,,
177,0.97,898.397,905.804,"Because the change was so simple, our election officials were able to implement it over just two months.",36,,
178,0.97,905.804,911.977,And we were able to start using it essentially immediately.,36,,
179,0.97,911.977,919.918,Which was really exciting so we were able that following spring to begin to use it.,36,,
180,0.97,919.918,929.161,We have had now multiple primers with approval voting in our 2020 Mayoral primary St.,36,,
181,0.97,929.161,934.566,Louis had four candidates and voters supported an average of 1.5 candidates on the ballot.,36,,
182,0.97,934.566,942.541,"And the really significant vote that we experienced in 2017, basically Spirally vanished.",36,,
183,0.97,942.541,945.477,And so that was really exciting to see.,36,,
184,0.97,945.477,953.052,Especially in a city that is 45% black and yet very rarely elected black candidates.,36,,
185,0.97,953.052,958.857,This resulted in Missouri electing our first black female Mayor.,36,,
186,0.97,958.857,962.227,Approval voting helps make elections fair in St. Louis.,36,,

463,0.97,2112.81,2117.014,"Councilmember Lewis, as a sponsor of this bill, the floor is yours.",100,,
464,0.97,2117.014,2119.917,"Thank you, Council President Juarez.",101,,
465,0.97,2119.917,2123.821,And thank you for that procedural overview.,101,,
466,0.97,2123.821,2129.46,I'll keep my comments to the substance of the legislation.,101,,
467,0.97,2129.46,2159.357,But this legislation was reported out of the public assets and homelessness Committee a couple weeks ago as a Departmentally requested legislation to continue the arrangement between the Seattle parks and recreation Department and Seattle prep with the Montlake play field located at Montlake park in the Capitol Hill Montlake neighborhood.,101,,
468,0.97,2159.357,2161.626,Just as a little bit of background.,101,,
469,0.97,2161.626,2196.694,"A little over a decade ago, the precursor arrangement to this was that Seattle prep would pay to replace a turf play field at Montlake play field park and in return, Seattle parks and recreation would give exclusive access to that play field for a string of weeks in the spring and a string of weeks in the fall for school related sports and activities.",101,,
470,0.97,2196.694,2211.275,Otherwise the space would be an open and programmable public park in accordance with the standard rules and procedures for all other Seattle public park facilities.,101,,
471,0.97,2211.275,2215.012,The turf field wore out after a decade of use and wear.,101,,
472,0.97,2215.012,2220.685,And Seattle parks is proposing to go back and do this agreement again.,101,,
473,0.97,2220.685,2233.231,And have Seattle prep replace the turf field in exchange for the same programmatic access that they've enjoyed over the past decade.,101,,
474,0.97,2233.231,2248.879,The only material change in this deal to the one that was previously negotiated by parks is that Seattle prep will provide 50 hours of community based programming as part of the requirement for this arrangement.,101,,
475,0.97,2248.879,2255.152,So it's a better deal for the city and for the public than the previous Iteration of the deal.,101,,
476,0.97,2255.152,2260.758,We did have a robust discussion about this legislation in committee.,101,,
477,0.97,2260.758,2269.1,It ultimately passed out of committee with four votes in favor and one abstention.,101,,
478,0.97,2269.1,2272.47,And I don't have any other comments on the legislation.,101,,
479,0.97,2272.47,2280.878,"But would encourage passage and that's--those are the only remarks I have, Council President.",101,,
480,0.97,2280.878,2288.653,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, I'm going to open the floor to any of my colleagues that would like to add dress Councilmember Lewis' bill.",102,,
481,0.97,2288.653,2290.921,Or the bill itself.,102,,
482,0.97,2290.921,2291.389,Councilmember Sawant.,102,,
483,0.97,2291.389,2294.892,"Then after that, we have Councilmember Herbold.",102,,
484,0.97,2294.892,2297.361,"Thank you, Council President Juarez.",103,,
485,0.97,2297.361,2304.168,"As I said last week when we were first discussing this bill, I'll be voting no on this contract.",103,,
486,0.97,2304.168,2308.105,Our parks are a public resource Tht should be available for all.,103,,
487,0.97,2308.105,2318.349,This contract gives a private school exclusive access to the play field for a substantial part of the day which Unfortunately means that it will be unavailable during those hours for anyone else.,103,,
488,0.97,2318.349,2321.652,Such as students from Seattle public schools.,103,,
489,0.97,2321.652,2325.556,New Astro turf on the play field is no doubt a real benefit.,103,,
490,0.97,2325.556,2330.928,However I do not think that outweighs losing public control of the space Ffer much of the day.,103,,
491,0.97,2330.928,2332.797,"So for that reason, Ly vote no.",103,,
492,0.97,2332.797,2335.232,"Thank you Councilmember Sawant, Councilmember Herbold.",103,,
493,0.97,2335.232,2337.835,I did vote in favor of this in committee.,104,,
494,0.97,2337.835,2345.543,I know in the committee vote I believe Councilmember Morales Abstained.,104,,
495,0.97,2345.543,2349.847,I'm interested--I wasn't here at full council last week.,104,,
496,0.97,2349.847,2355.72,I am interested to know what has transpired since last week.,104,,
497,0.97,2355.72,2359.29,I believe there were some specific questions asked in the interim.,104,,
498,0.97,2359.29,2370.968,And I'm just interested to know the sort of--the substance of the answers of the questions regarding the public benefit provided by parks.,104,,
499,0.97,2370.968,2376.407,If anybody has that information.,104,,
500,0.97,2376.407,2390.321,"Before I move to you, Councilmember Lewis, I want to see if there's anyone else and then I'll move back to you to concluded remarks or would you like to respond now to Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Lewis?",105,,
501,0.97,2390.321,2403.868,I can read some of the remarks that we received in response from parks to Councilmember Morales' questions in the open session here today.,106,,
502,0.97,2403.868,2404.769,I was Cc'Ed,106,,
503,0.97,2404.769,2406.871,"Councilmember Lewis, can you share the date on that?",107,,
504,0.97,2406.871,2415.379,I think we all received that memo.,107,,
505,0.97,2415.379,2415.646,Correct?,107,,
506,0.97,2415.646,2415.88,Yes.,108,,
507,0.97,2415.88,2423.788,"The entire Council, Council was Cc'Ed on Paula Hoff's response to Councilmember Morales' questions that Email is dated Friday June 24th.",108,,
508,0.97,2423.788,2424.922,Thank you.,109,,
509,0.97,2424.922,2435.266,"And because there was a lot of public discussion at full council last week, I just think it's useful for the public record to hear what those responses were.",110,,
510,0.97,2435.266,2439.103,I think Councilmember Lewis is going to do that.,111,,
511,0.97,2439.103,2439.904,[Laughter],111,,
512,0.97,2439.904,2447.344,"And Councilmember Herbold and Council President, I am happy to summarize the responses that we received from parks.",112,,
513,0.97,2447.344,2449.18,So just indulge with me for a moment.,112,,
514,0.97,2449.18,2451.649,I do have it available and in front of me.,112,,
515,0.97,2451.649,2478.709,One of the questions raised by Councilmember Morales has been how many agreements do we have that offer reserved access for private entities in exchange for some level of investment in the parks? Seattle parks and recreation responded that the following principles are used to assess the viability of the private entity investments which are namely determining project impact to neighboring communities and their uses of the field.,112,,
516,0.97,2478.709,2486.45,Ensuring community field usage hours are maintained and are not reduced for the general public.,112,,
517,0.97,2486.45,2492.99,Community benefits from a higher quality field with the investment.,112,,
518,0.97,2492.99,2499.296,So weighing the benefit of the field against any potential lack of programming time.,112,,
519,0.97,2499.296,2504.268,Consideration of the location of where the investment was going to be made.,112,,
520,0.97,2504.268,2509.206,"So, you know, whether it be equity of how we're distributing these arrangements.",112,,
521,0.97,2509.206,2517.748,Whether Seattle parks and recreation is in a position to make their own investment in the site instead of a private partner.,112,,
522,0.97,2517.748,2519.049,The size of the investment.,112,,
523,0.97,2519.049,2522.253,And the Eenty being able to provide public benefits.,112,,
524,0.97,2522.253,2528.559,Which as we established is a bigger emphasis in the renegotiation of the deal.,112,,
525,0.97,2528.559,2537.434,"We then provide a list of the current standing arrangements that are similar to Montlake, including Monday Lake.",112,,
526,0.97,2537.434,2549.813,"So in addition to the Montlake arrangement, South Park play field with Seattle Academy, inner base Stadium with Seattle Pacific University.",112,,
527,0.97,2549.813,2553.317,Bar s play field with West Seattle little League.,112,,
528,0.97,2553.317,2559.356,And the Magnessun Cricketed pitch.,112,,
529,0.97,2559.356,2567.831,So five locations across Seattle parks and recreation that have this kind of contract.,112,,
530,0.97,2567.831,2570.568,And I won't go into the rest of the details.,112,,
531,0.97,2570.568,2583.847,"But if colleagues want to review, parks did provide a significant am of detail on all of those agreements in addition that they can review for the level of investment and public benefit that is detailed in the memo.",112,,
532,0.97,2583.847,2595.225,The next question from Councilmember Morales was what analysis has been done on Seattle park facilities to assess local neighborhood access verses private school access.,112,,
533,0.97,2595.225,2610.007,And Seattle parks indicated they're currently conducting outreach to assess what each of the local neighborhoods desire for park play fields and this has also sort of been a component of the metropolitan park Driblght outreach that we're familiar from that process.,112,,
534,0.97,2610.007,2611.742,They track play field use.,112,,
535,0.97,2611.742,2616.146,Through our use reports for known play field users are.,112,,
536,0.97,2616.146,2624.555,"And very, you know, high Utilizers of play fields, public schools, private schools, youth organizations, adult Rec leagues.",112,,
537,0.97,2624.555,2632.062,Seattle parks and recreation official recreation programs and of course just individual groups for private events.,112,,
538,0.97,2632.062,2635.599,Seattle public schools have first priority scheduling rights.,112,,
539,0.97,2635.599,2638.602,Through the joint use agreement for all Seattle parks.,112,,
540,0.97,2638.602,2642.639,Which is a point that they note.,112,,
541,0.97,2642.639,2649.913,But that is--that excludes the facilities where there is a unique arrangement with a private partner.,112,,
542,0.97,2649.913,2660.924,"But again, that's only in a couple of scenarios, Montlake, South Park, and the West Seattle Stadium.",112,,
543,0.97,2663.661,2677.141,"The final question--two questions from Councilmember Morales that were answered, how is the public benefit in this particular, the Montlake agreement calculated and how are we measuring their success in providing a public benefit.",112,,
544,0.97,2677.141,2684.314,"And parks responded that in the original agreement, Seattle prep was not required to provide an explicit public benefit component.",112,,
545,0.97,2684.314,2694.525,And the new proposal does Enumerate as I've indicated a requirement of 50 additional public programming hours which is a new component of the contract.,112,,
546,0.97,2694.525,2701.732,And that is going to be tracked and recorded as part of the agreement.,112,,
547,0.97,2701.732,2717.181,"Upon entering into an agreement, this is the final question, Councilmember Morales asked, upon entering into an agreement, what is the--how do we essentially assess and understand the equitable benefit to the community.",112,,
548,0.97,2717.181,2725.589,So touching on the equity of these arrangements and this is broken into several sub questions.,112,,
549,0.97,2725.589,2734.164,"The first, what is the community outreach to communities of color to receive scholarships and participate in the Sporing programs at this site?",112,,
550,0.97,2734.164,2750.314,"Parks responded that per the agreement, Seattle prep will be reaching out to community centers around the city as well as schools with specific offers to participate in this supplemental program.",112,,
551,0.97,2750.314,2760.657,Generally registrations run through their Website for on campus middle school camps which is one of the things Seattle prep is offering registration for Lacrosse.,112,,
552,0.97,2760.657,2762.826,And speed and agility camps.,112,,
553,0.97,2762.826,2767.397,Run Offline to eliminate the barriers to entry.,112,,
554,0.97,2767.397,2768.499,So In-Person recruitment.,112,,
555,0.97,2768.499,2774.071,All fees for those camps will be waved for low income and disadvantaged youth.,112,,
556,0.97,2774.071,2777.374,These camps are meant to serve as an opportunity to introduce new groups.,112,,
557,0.97,2777.374,2783.28,"New sports, and spread fitness to under served communities.",112,,
558,0.97,2783.28,2791.455,"The other sub question in that category, what are the Statistics regarding applications and number of scholarships and participation.",112,,
559,0.97,2791.455,2795.793,These public benefits will be tracked through an annual report.,112,,
560,0.97,2795.793,2802.833,"And the report requires Seattle prep to track participation numbers, hours of service provided.",112,,
561,0.97,2802.833,2807.905,"Volunteer hours, numbers of programs provided and the cost associated with all the public benefits.",112,,
562,0.97,2807.905,2817.347,So there are Arctic Ewe Articulatable parts.,112,,
563,0.97,2817.347,2820.217,Seattle prep operated programs in the past for the community at no cost.,112,,
564,0.97,2820.217,2821.718,So there's a track record.,112,,
565,0.97,2821.718,2824.621,The organization has for this.,112,,
566,0.97,2824.621,2827.591,So parks doesn't anticipate compliance to be an issue.,112,,
567,0.97,2827.591,2833.664,All Seattle prep run programs and events through the public benefit requirement will be free to the community.,112,,
568,0.97,2833.664,2839.336,So there's no expectation of Seattle prep charging for any services.,112,,
569,0.97,2839.336,2846.043,And the final sub question was what in the past experience and methods of reaching out to youth within those communities.,112,,
570,0.97,2846.043,2851.915,So what is the track record of Seattle prep as a partner in doing this work?,112,,
571,0.97,2851.915,2864.094,"And the past experiences have been in conjunction with the Montlake community center, the Seattle Nativity school, Northwest child and other nonprofit groups that are local to the Seattle prep neighborhood.",112,,
572,0.97,2864.094,2874.838,Seattle prep has partnered with the Montlake community center in the past to provide student lead tutoring service for children of low income and marginalized backgrounds.,112,,
573,0.97,2874.838,2881.878,Seattle prep worked with Northwest child to facilitate programs dedicated to supporting people with disabilities with recreational opportunities.,112,,
574,0.97,2881.878,2890.487,So that is the summary of Seattle parks responses.,112,,
575,0.97,2890.487,2908.038,Councilmembers can review the memo provided last Friday and the attachment of the public benefits template and matrix that is attached to the legislation is a good reference point as well to provide a summary of the details of the contract.,112,,
576,0.97,2908.038,2914.111,So thanks for indulging that long recitation.,112,,
577,0.97,2914.111,2921.218,"Thank you, are there any other comments? I just want to wrap up, thank you Councilmember Lewis.",113,,
578,0.97,2921.218,2930.794,"That so formally as chair parks, we did completely redo the public benefits piece that you see reflected now in the new agreements.",113,,
579,0.97,2930.794,2941.705,"I want to thank Councilmember Sawant, Mosqueda, and thank you Councilmember Herbold for Teeing up other issues and the thank you Councilmember Lewis for summarizing the memo we all received.",113,,
580,0.97,2941.705,2969.499,"We did insert and make sure parks has a robust race and social justice piece that the public benefits piece is outweighs the private use of the public benefits that we track the progress and the success and the benefits and the use and more importantly, as you shared Councilmember Lewis, that we look at outreach not only to the communities but working with community centers and any other public asset that the private entity is using the public space for.",113,,
581,0.97,2969.499,2971.168,So thank you for that.,113,,
582,0.97,2971.168,2978.875,"Okay, so not seeing anything else, Councilmember Lewis, is there anything you want to say before we go to a vote?",114,,
583,0.97,2978.875,2983.013,"No, Council President, I'll rest on my previous remarks.",115,,

848,0.97,4059.021,4062.858,I'm so excited about this legislation.,252,,
849,0.97,4062.858,4078.307,An update the housing public Policys to accomplish a new jump start acquisition and preservation program which we have done the jump start community self-determination fund because that is exactly what it is designed to do.,252,,
850,0.97,4078.307,4095.424,This fund will provide acquisition and funding along with funding for technical assistance so that organizations are able to secure land and or secure buildings to develop community driven housing with full ownership and Self- determination.,252,,
851,0.97,4095.424,4106.535,This legislation is the result of many conversations we've had with our community housing round table Compriseed of community based organizations who are working to provide housing for their communities.,252,,
852,0.97,4106.535,4121.517,Some of whom have joined us at our robust committee discussion on June 15th including El Centro de la Raza.,252,,
853,0.97,4121.517,4151.847,"The program is designed to support projects like Plaza Roberto, by El Centro and the recently opened fill Peu open opened Filipino community center.",252,,
854,0.97,4151.847,4170.199,The housing spend plan which designates 13% of housing funds annually to be used to accomplish a community focused acquisition development and program support fund for housing rooted in serving communities most at risk of displacement.,252,,
855,0.97,4170.199,4182.077,"That addresses past discriminatory policies such as red lining, restricted racial and other Discriminatively patterns that have negatively impacted Seattle.",252,,
856,0.97,4182.077,4205.167,The second is the slide that was included in the 2022 budget requesting the office of housing to identify modifications to the city's housing funding policies to address policy barriers including partnership requirements for small community based developers that may have difficulty Accessing the city's acquisition funding.,252,,
857,0.97,4205.167,4232.328,One thing that we've heard from the community housing round table over the past year is that requirements in our existing acquisition and preservation fund make it very challenging for community based organizations to get the acquisition funding needed to secure land or funding which is the first step in creating community funding.,252,,
858,0.97,4232.328,4236.732,So they can seize opportunities to acquire land or buildings when they arrive.,252,,
859,0.97,4236.732,4245.874,And allow them time to get a development plan in place to best serve the needs of their communities.,252,,
860,0.97,4245.874,4263.759,One of the things I'm most excited about this funding program is it includes a long call for the technical support funding so that community organizations have support to navigate the acquisition development process and are building skills as developers along the way.,252,,
861,0.97,4263.759,4275.638,This is how we increase our system wide capacity for more community rooted housing many thanks to Council colleagues for your support of these efforts.,252,,
862,0.97,4275.638,4286.215,Thank you for the Department of housing for your great partnership of this program and for your shared goal of more equitable funding streams to support community driven development.,252,,
