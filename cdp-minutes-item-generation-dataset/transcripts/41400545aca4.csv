80,0.97,590.289,615.881,"I feel that there are pedestrian, not only pedestrian trucks interactions that seem to be repeating things that occur in the South end, on the pedestrian train accidents, but I believe that the conflict with the steel mill are not easily, or don't really Falwell to avoidance of mitigation or relocation of providers.",19,,

109,0.97,809.542,833.365,"Due to the location of the tunnel, or not the tunnel, I'm sorry, the proposed station, the BLOCKAGE of Sr-99 on and off, and also the tunnel, will be unavailable during construction, and even afterwards.",23,,
110,0.97,833.365,841.34,"In 2019, these when Seventh Avenue was rerouted to that street, and anyone before Covid, between 3:00 and 7:00 p.m., it was a nightmare to get in and out of.",23,,

116,0.97,876.442,884.783,"But we really do hope that you look at the accessibility of that, and also impacts of displacing minority owned businesses.",23,,
117,0.97,884.783,900.165,"To displace a hotel is not as simple as moving it to another neighborhood, and also something that was once affordable to many is no longer affordable to any.",23,,

123,0.97,933.899,956.622,"I want to thank all the Councilmembers in creating amendment 1 to withhold any recommendation for a station and a line in Dell ridge, and I urge this full committee to strengthen that language even further in section 2B regarding the mitigating impacts and relocating displaced services in Delridge.",25,,
124,0.97,956.622,967.199,Amendment 1 recognizes that no amount of geographic convenience can justify the decision.,25,,
125,0.97,967.199,974.173,Or the incredible lack of information provided by sound transit in there Deis study.,25,,
126,0.97,974.173,987.986,"The problems go far beyond that, including a pedestrian, and freight traffic conflicts, transfer service, interference with access to public elementary school, and on and on.",25,,

130,0.97,1011.076,1028.66,"It's clear the only reason an extreme northern station alignment in Delridge, such as Dell 5 or Dell 6 are being considered is because it delivers the train to the underground junction.",25,,

331,0.97,2310.841,2319.15,"I'd like to get started by putting base resolution before us, then I'd like to get the consolidated amendment one before us.",56,,
332,0.97,2319.15,2332.83,"Then we can have central staff walk us through the proposed revisions contained in amendment 1, and address any questions with the based.",56,,
333,0.97,2332.83,2338.035,"There will be amendment number two, from Councilmember Strauss, and 3 from Councilmember Sawant.",56,,

335,0.97,2343.107,2359.19,"So again, I'm just going to get us started by putting the base legislation before us, and then the amendment 1 that was on the agenda before us, and we will recognize Councilmembers after we hear from Calvin chow.",56,,
336,0.97,2359.19,2362.36,"Again, Sara Maxana from Sdot is here with us as well.",56,,

339,0.97,2371.135,2376.54,"Thank you, it's been moved and Seconded.",58,,
340,0.97,2376.54,2377.508,Recommended adoption of 32055.,58,,
341,0.97,2377.508,2386.05,And now I move to amend as presented on amendment 1 on today's agenda.,58,,
342,0.97,2386.05,2388.152,Is there a second?,58,,
343,0.97,2388.152,2388.452,Second.,59,,
344,0.97,2388.452,2400.931,"Thank you, it's been moved and Seconded to adopt amendment 1. amendment 1 is now with always along with the base legislation.",60,,
345,0.97,2400.931,2405.202,There's going to be an amendment to amendment 1 shortly.,60,,
346,0.97,2405.202,2423.354,"But I wanted to give us the opportunity to walk through the parts of amendment 1 for the viewing public, which you can also see if you go to the city council Website, transportation Committee, and look on today's agenda, amendment 1 is there.",60,,
347,0.97,2423.354,2423.821,Welcome Calvin chow.,60,,
348,0.97,2423.821,2424.889,Thank you.,61,,
349,0.97,2424.889,2437.201,"I put on the screen the text to amendment 1. as you mentioned earlier, it is largely followed up of discussion Councilmembers had.",61,,
350,0.97,2437.201,2438.068,Two committee meetings ago.,61,,
351,0.97,2438.068,2445.91,I can walk through the specific sections that are impacted.,61,,
352,0.97,2445.91,2451.182,Amendment 1 would affect the Delridge segment recommendation to state that there is no preference at this time.,61,,
353,0.97,2451.182,2470.968,"It calls out the impacts to Alki Beach Academy, and resources as impacts that need to be fully analyzed, and identifies that avoidance, or mitigation of the impacts or the relocation of those services is a condition for the city support of Dell 6 in the future.",61,,
354,0.97,2470.968,2475.272,The amendment also makes changes to the South Interbay segment.,61,,
355,0.97,2475.272,2485.182,It States that while we do not have a specific recommendation for the segment that we would support the Smith Cove station location at West gala street.,61,,
356,0.97,2485.182,2493.324,"And this is what is shown in the Sib1 alignment, because of its support for transit connections to magnolia.",61,,
357,0.97,2493.324,2499.063,"It would also make some changes to the Interbay, and Ballard segment.",61,,
358,0.97,2499.063,2505.269,It would identify the Seattle storm facility and other community assets in Interbay.,61,,
359,0.97,2505.269,2524.588,"There's no Substation there, but there is property for a future Substation, as well as States that the 14th Avenue Northwest station alternative is unacceptable because of the station accessibility issues that it RAISES as opposed to 15th Avenue.",61,,
360,0.97,2524.588,2535.065,"Thank you, and we are going to hear from Councilmembers about these amendments and again, there will be an amendment to amendment one.",62,,
361,0.97,2535.065,2542.006,I do want to recognize that Councilmember Sara Nelson has been present from the beginning of this item.,62,,
362,0.97,2542.006,2550.714,"While not a committee member, Non-Committee members were invited to be able to hear the discussion or speak to the discussion.",62,,
363,0.97,2550.714,2558.989,"So thank you, Calvin chow for going through the contents of amendment one, and we are going to have an amendment to this amend in a moment.",62,,
364,0.97,2558.989,2572.436,"I just wanted to recognize Sara from the Seattle Department of transportation who has worked really hard on this process with sound transit, and will continue to do so as our city's designated representative.",62,,
365,0.97,2572.436,2573.904,I wanted to give Sara a chance.,62,,
366,0.97,2573.904,2579.143,Did you want to speak to any of these items in amendment 1?,62,,
367,0.97,2579.143,2583.213,I do not need to speak to any of them at this time in detail.,63,,
368,0.97,2583.213,2611.275,"But just at a high level, I want to say I appreciate the partnership and all of the offices working on these amendments, and that the amendments do not Fundmentaly change the recommendation, but really add some needed specificity of importance to Councilmembers, and respond to feedback, that's been heard in this process.",63,,
369,0.97,2611.275,2612.042,So thank you.,63,,
370,0.97,2612.042,2614.812,Thank you very much.,64,,
371,0.97,2614.812,2626.824,"So colleagues the floor is open to you all to speak to this amendment one, and also, we will be getting, I know we have an amendment to this amendment as well.",64,,
372,0.97,2626.824,2631.996,So Whoever wants to jump in first.,64,,
373,0.97,2631.996,2636.533,"But again, there's plenty of time here.",64,,
374,0.97,2636.533,2638.869,Councilmember Herbold.,65,,
375,0.97,2638.869,2639.203,I can't tell.,65,,
376,0.97,2639.203,2645.242,You can go ahead of me.,65,,
377,0.97,2645.242,2646.677,"Go ahead, Councilmember Herbold.",66,,
378,0.97,2646.677,2649.279,"Bear with me, and I'll Muddle through it.",67,,
379,0.97,2649.279,2651.715,Thanks so much.,67,,
380,0.97,2651.715,2674.738,"I just want to thank you folks for [inaudible] Councilmembers, especially Council chair Pedersen, and members of the public for engaging on this particular amendment related to the West Seattle segment.",67,,
381,0.97,2674.738,2686.15,"I really appreciate selecting the preferred alternative, and for noting those incidents where we don't have a preference.",67,,
382,0.97,2686.15,2698.796,"As it relates to the language in the base bill, we know that for the West Seattle junction, there's strong community support for tunnel option and I support that.",67,,
383,0.97,2698.796,2730.627,"The tunnel would minimize impact to the neighborhood and Businesseses, and provide the best approach for long term success in the health of the West Seattle junction community, and we know that an elevated segment into the heart of the West Seattle junction urban village, and on Fauntleroy way Southwest would be completely [inaudible] for Seattle, and it would include impacts that simply could not be mitigated.",67,,
384,0.97,2730.627,2745.209,"So the main tunnel has a comparable cost estimate to elevated options, and is a really important Iteration for a regional project.",67,,
385,0.97,2745.209,2761.625,"As it relates to the Duwamish crossing, recognize that there is community perspective and both North and South crossings have their impact.",67,,
386,0.97,2761.625,2773.403,"South crossing is conditioned on adequate mitigation of access to parks, and natural habitat at the West Duwamish green belt.",67,,
387,0.97,2773.403,2777.608,That's the language that's in the base bill.,67,,
388,0.97,2777.608,2802.566,"But as it relates specifically to the amendment for us, I really appreciate having the opportunity to offer some language recognizing that there is no clear community consensus on this segment, all alignments have impacts on residents and businesses.",67,,
389,0.97,2802.566,2806.336,It's very evident in the draft EIS.,67,,
390,0.97,2806.336,2824.488,"I really appreciate the addition from the executive to the first draft of the resolution, including a request for transit access study for communities, identified in the racial equity tool kit, including South Delridge and white center.",67,,
391,0.97,2824.488,2836.4,And the resolution also added mention of how important protections for long fellow Creek are.,67,,
392,0.97,2836.4,2841.939,These are really helpful additions and I thank you for offering them.,67,,
393,0.97,2841.939,2854.117,Delridge five and six options were developed to minimize impacts on Youngstown community.,67,,
394,0.97,2854.117,2860.824,"It's really important to note that they were added late in the fiscal process, and they were added at the board level.",67,,
395,0.97,2860.824,2867.731,So the potential of these options weren't discussed during the Scoping process.,67,,
396,0.97,2867.731,2880.51,"So again, the Delridge 5 and 6 impacts did not have sort of the thorough discussion of those impacts during the Scoping process, because they were late options.",67,,
397,0.97,2880.51,2906.57,"And we know of a couple impacts for Delridge 6, that have come up since the draft EIS was published, as noted in public comment, the draft EIS does not mention the existence of the Alki Beach Academy Daycare center and the social resources section in Appendix L., where you can see care centers on the line are noted.",67,,
398,0.97,2906.57,2914.278,The importance of a Daycare of this size on the peninsula is magnified by the closure.,67,,
399,0.97,2914.278,2922.486,And the center provides care for over 120 children and plans to expand to be able to care for 300 children.,67,,
400,0.97,2922.486,2949.846,"But again, the fact that this location is not even named in the draft EIS RAISES concern for me that not only was the analysis of impacts inadequate as it relates to this particular service, but that perhaps this particular service was unknown during the analysis.",67,,
401,0.97,2949.846,2970.233,"Again, another impact is the transitional resources, social service, which offers 24/7 services to people with serious mental illness with both a living facility on site, and the service center.",67,,
402,0.97,2970.233,2983.88,"The living facilities depend on 24/7 intergrated services between the folks receiving the services, as well as the folks living there, and the draft EIS does not address the nurture of the gram.",67,,
403,0.97,2983.88,3002.432,The 31 high need individuals could be faced with 122 people per month losing access that long care mental illness facility move clients at the facility were homeless.,67,,
404,0.97,3002.432,3010.974,Further the property beat itself to a Covenant requiring the property be used for the services for the foreseeable future.,67,,
405,0.97,3010.974,3048.078,"So in order to address these deficiencies, I developed the portion of this amendment that relates to West Seattle and simply says that the city is not able [inaudible] the inadequate analysis of services, and notes that one, it did not identify the Alki Beach Academy as a potential impacted social resource and therefore did not fully analyze the project's impact on different services.",67,,
406,0.97,3048.078,3055.952,"And Secondly, while the Deis identified transitional resources in the list, there was an inadequate analysis of impact.",67,,
407,0.97,3055.952,3074.137,"And then Finally, it States that future support for Dell 6 is conditioned on avoidance, or mitigation of impacts of transportation or housing providers.",67,,
408,0.97,3074.137,3088.018,"Again, these are conditions that are achievable, and really appreciate the opportunity to put them forward as a Commission as necessary for the port authority.",67,,
409,0.97,3088.018,3088.418,Appreciate that.,67,,
410,0.97,3088.418,3089.653,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",68,,
411,0.97,3089.653,3098.628,I think this is just another demonstration of how the District Councilmembers know their areas better than anybody.,68,,
412,0.97,3098.628,3108.572,Thank you for providing this solid input to this for West Seattle ..,68,,
413,0.97,3108.572,3110.774,Any comments at this point?,68,,
414,0.97,3110.774,3111.041,Sure.,69,,
415,0.97,3111.041,3112.609,"Go ahead, Councilmember Strauss.",70,,
416,0.97,3112.609,3118.014,I will speak to the language that I added into this Consolidated amendment.,71,,
417,0.97,3118.014,3127.991,"And I'll speak to the bit that I'll want to change, even though we'll come back to that through parliamentary procedure.",71,,
418,0.97,3127.991,3139.97,I just want to first by thanking Council staff and central staff for the amount of time they've spend with me over the last few weeks.,71,,
419,0.97,3139.97,3144.007,I want to acknowledge this resolution does not have any legal teeth.,71,,
420,0.97,3144.007,3155.719,This has been a tool for bringing members of the community and the city together to discuss and understand the details that are currently before the sound transit board.,71,,
421,0.97,3155.719,3159.523,The sound transit boards being the ones to make the final recommendation.,71,,
422,0.97,3159.523,3180.911,"So oftentimes, I want to ensure this is brought in a good spirit, because oftentimes situations like this can create more argument than solution, and I want to share that I know my colleagues, I especially am here with the desire to find the way forward, because we're all in this together.",71,,
423,0.97,3180.911,3196.426,"The sound transit board, being a Tricounty board, I want anyone listening from sound transit, I think you've heard me say this at every single meeting, it is as important to get to Everett and Tacoma as it is to get to Ballard and West Seattle.",71,,
424,0.97,3196.426,3197.694,We will find a way.,71,,
425,0.97,3197.694,3207.571,I'm commit today seeing our lines reach Pierce and Snohomish County.,71,,
426,0.97,3207.571,3209.539,The core of Pierce and Snohomish County.,71,,
427,0.97,3209.539,3221.051,"The conversations I'm having with members of my community, and I would be doing a disservice to them, if I were not to bring this, even though I want to work with good spirit to be able to find the solution forward.",71,,
428,0.97,3221.051,3233.73,"I bring these amendments to reflect the needs of the people I represent, and I have a strong desire to work with SPD board members with the budget reality sound transit is experiencing.",71,,
429,0.97,3233.73,3238.969,There are two criteria most important to my community members.,71,,
430,0.97,3238.969,3247.077,That's Ridership access and proximity to the housing and commercial core.,71,,
431,0.97,3247.077,3252.649,15th Avenue West is a barrier we must solve for no matter where the station goes.,71,,
432,0.97,3252.649,3257.654,"Calvin, if you can remind me of the two other locations where we've had to cross?",71,,
433,0.97,3257.654,3262.759,"I believe it's Montlake, and Broadway, is that correct?",71,,
434,0.97,3262.759,3271.534,"Or were there other examples of high amounts of vehicles on the roadway, that we have a station at, and needed to create a safe pedestrian crossing for.",71,,
435,0.97,3271.534,3275.138,There are two other stations where two others have come up.,72,,
436,0.97,3275.138,3283.847,"On the South Hill station, there was an additional station head house that was put on the West side of Broadway, so that riders could access it from both sides of Broadway.",72,,
437,0.97,3283.847,3296.86,"Then at the University of Washington station, there is a pedestrian structure that crosses over the Montlake Pacific interchange to get riders to the U Dub campus.",72,,
438,0.97,3296.86,3307.604,"Montlake, does it have a higher level of service vehicular level of service than 15th?",73,,
439,0.97,3307.604,3315.211,I believe I looked at the 2018 traffic counts.,74,,
440,0.97,3315.211,3319.616,"And the intersection of market and 15th averaged about 55,000 daily vehicles.",74,,
441,0.97,3319.616,3325.121,"University of Washington, so that would be Montlake and Pacific has about 61,000.",74,,
442,0.97,3325.121,3326.956,So it's a bill little bit higher.,74,,
443,0.97,3326.956,3336.199,"Then the Broadway, and John location is a little bit lower at 29,500.",74,,
444,0.97,3336.199,3338.234,"Was the Montlake count, was it at the bridge?",75,,
445,0.97,3338.234,3346.843,That's just the vehicles that are crossing on Pacific Avenue and Montlake Boulevard.,76,,
446,0.97,3346.843,3348.745,Sort of that combination of vehicles.,76,,
447,0.97,3348.745,3349.546,"Thank you, Calvin.",77,,
448,0.97,3349.546,3353.149,I wanted to make sure that I got those points correct.,77,,
449,0.97,3353.149,3359.222,Because what 15th Avenue does is it creates a barrier for us to meet our vision zero goals.,77,,
450,0.97,3359.222,3373.369,"For us to connect the highest level of Ridership, the sound transit analysis demonstrates the highest Ridership is going to be coming from West of 15th.",77,,
451,0.97,3373.369,3382.212,"The conversation you'll hear from me today is how do we make that crossing safe, and how do we ensure we have the highest Ridership possible?",77,,
452,0.97,3382.212,3386.85,"We understand we need to find cost savings, and I believe there is a way forward.",77,,
453,0.97,3386.85,3397.794,"After the initial conversation with the incredible Cahill ridge last week, we're already discussed a number of opportunities.",77,,
454,0.97,3397.794,3407.57,"What stands out to me is we're having a bit of a Tif, a bit of a fight, around 14th and 15th because of cost, and I fully understand that.",77,,
455,0.97,3407.57,3422.152,"What is standing out to me today is that Fifth Avenue is an in right of way alignment, and 15th is a private property alignment.",77,,
456,0.97,3422.152,3424.42,We need to have an apples to apples comparison.,77,,
457,0.97,3424.42,3430.96,This is too important of a decision to make without having an even comparison.,77,,
458,0.97,3430.96,3441.704,"Because we're making a decision that would impact Ridership, Liveability, the proximity to the commercial core based on an uneven analysis.",77,,
459,0.97,3441.704,3444.941,It's a good analysis.,77,,
460,0.97,3444.941,3445.542,A very thorough analysis.,77,,
461,0.97,3445.542,3450.747,It's just we need to be comparing the data points that are mirrored.,77,,
462,0.97,3450.747,3459.055,"I'll speak to the intent of my amendment, and then we can do the parliamentary procedure later.",77,,
463,0.97,3459.055,3466.696,"In the chairs Consolidated amendment, I have language that says 14th Avenue is unacceptable.",77,,
464,0.97,3466.696,3479.776,And I'd like to add any alignment on 14th Avenue Northwest is unacceptable without a station entrance West of 15th Avenue Northwest.,77,,
465,0.97,3479.776,3513.042,"The original language went on to say based on the criteria in section C. 14th has been an unacceptable to location to community members due to it being further from the crossing core, as well as the lack of crossings from the third most used crossing core in the city, only behind Sr-99, and I-5 . It might seem like just a block, it's much more than that.",77,,
466,0.97,3513.042,3517.547,15th Avenue is already a half mile from the commercial core.,77,,
467,0.97,3517.547,3522.485,This alignment does not take into consideration the crossing of 15th.,77,,
468,0.97,3522.485,3542.038,"My changed language clarifies that while 14th is not a preferred alignment, and I think you heard Mike Stewart from the Ballard Chamber of Commerce state today, he hasn't, and I haven't found anyone in favor of 14th.",77,,
469,0.97,3542.038,3554.183,14th does become unacceptable when there's not a station entrance West of 15th to the cross for the high level that the state will use.,77,,
470,0.97,3554.183,3560.089,Sound transit already demonstrates the most riders will come from West of 15th.,77,,
471,0.97,3560.089,3566.696,Severely limited at the 14th Avenue as it is on the border of our industrial zone.,77,,
472,0.97,3566.696,3580.31,The amendment to my included language clarifies 14th becomes Unalignable when there's not a station West of 15th.,77,,
473,0.97,3580.31,3585.782,"This is not a Gold-Plated request, this is a fundmental request.",77,,
474,0.97,3585.782,3589.519,"We know without analysis, we won't have strong Ridership.",77,,
475,0.97,3589.519,3590.92,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",78,,
476,0.97,3590.92,3595.325,We will do the parliamentary procedure to make that change to amendment one in a moment.,78,,
477,0.97,3595.325,3607.236,I want to see if colleagues have any other comments on the base legislation or on amendment one.,78,,
478,0.97,3607.236,3612.575,Then we'll get to amendment two and three in a moment.,78,,
479,0.97,3612.575,3613.276,Councilmember Nelson.,78,,
480,0.97,3613.276,3636.432,"Yes, I appreciate chair Pedersen, you bringing forward this resolution, because I recognize, and I think most people do that the stronger that Seattle can be in stating our preference because the impacts are in the city of Seattle, the better our position is on the whole sound transit board.",79,,
481,0.97,3636.432,3640.97,So I appreciate Councilmember Strausss emphatic statement about 14th as well.,79,,
482,0.97,3640.97,3647.81,I just wanted to express that all the alternatives do have problems.,79,,
483,0.97,3647.81,3652.048,I'm personally concerned about the civic hotel for example.,79,,
484,0.97,3652.048,3674.937,"And as a citywide, I have to balance when it comes down to a vote ultimately at full Council, I have to balance all the issues with the different alignment preferences that individual Councilmembers expression, and also as a whole, that we put forward before the board.",79,,
485,0.97,3674.937,3680.276,So just stating that acknowledgement and voicing my appreciation for having this discussion today.,79,,
486,0.97,3680.276,3684.681,And thank you for allowing for Non-Committee members to join.,79,,
487,0.97,3684.681,3689.218,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",80,,
488,0.97,3689.218,3691.688,Appreciate the citywide perspective you bring to this as well.,80,,
489,0.97,3691.688,3718.114,"Let's go ahead, if there are no other comments on amendment one, exempt for an amendment to amendment one, we're going to make in a moment, again, we're going to get to amendment two and three, which were circulated by Email to the Councilmembers, Councilmembers at committees can actually walk on amendments to get them circulated via Email in advance is a great heads up.",80,,
490,0.97,3718.114,3728.024,"So let's go ahead and Councilmember Strauss, I know you have an amendment to amendment 1 that you articulated already.",80,,
491,0.97,3728.024,3741.104,"Would you mind reading that verbatim again into the record and then we can make a motion to prove that, and weave it into amendment 1.",80,,
492,0.97,3741.104,3741.504,Thank you.,81,,
493,0.97,3741.504,3760.456,I'd like to amend amendment 1 as reads any alignment on 14th Avenue Northwest is unacceptable adding the language without a station entrance West of 15th Avenue Northwest and the base language finished with based on criteria section 1. C.,81,,
494,0.97,3760.456,3786.215,"Okay, so at the end of amendment 1, it's amending that language to say on 14th Avenue Northwest is unacceptable without a station entrance West on 15th Northwest, based on the criteria articulated in section 1C?",82,,
495,0.97,3786.215,3786.916,That's exactly right.,83,,
496,0.97,3786.916,3791.854,"Okay, well I will second that motion.",84,,
497,0.97,3791.854,3801.33,Are there any comments on the amendment to amendment 1 from Councilmember Strauss?,84,,
498,0.97,3801.33,3811.874,"Hearing no additional Commentses on Councilmember's Strauss's amendment to amendment 1, will the clerk please call the roll.",84,,

504,0.97,3819.048,3819.949,Yes.,90,,
505,0.97,3819.949,3820.917,Chair Pedersen.,91,,
506,0.97,3820.917,3821.384,Yes.,92,,

508,0.97,3823.686,3833.095,"Excellent, the motion passes and amendment one is amended as we discussed.",94,,
509,0.97,3833.095,3841.571,Now we're going to take up--well now we're going to vote on amendment one as amended.,94,,
510,0.97,3841.571,3845.842,So we have amendment 1 before us.,94,,
511,0.97,3845.842,3850.646,"Although, let me double check something here.",94,,
512,0.97,3850.646,3859.822,"Amendment 2 is not technically amending amending amendment 1, it's amending the base legislation.",94,,
513,0.97,3859.822,3864.46,Amendment 3 is amending various sections.,94,,
514,0.97,3864.46,3866.862,Resolution so we can take that separately.,94,,
515,0.97,3866.862,3873.769,So we'll go ahead and now vote on amendment 1 as amended.,94,,
516,0.97,3873.769,3881.477,Now we're going to vote on amendment 1. okay.,94,,
517,0.97,3881.477,3887.283,Any comments on amendment 1 as amended?,94,,
518,0.97,3887.283,3893.789,Will the clerk please call the roll on amendment 1 as amended?,94,,
519,0.97,3893.789,3894.69,Councilmember Herbold?,95,,

522,0.97,3896.425,3897.326,Yes.,98,,
523,0.97,3897.326,3900.763,Councilmember Sawant.,99,,
524,0.97,3900.763,3901.23,Yes.,100,,
525,0.97,3901.23,3901.931,Councilmember Strauss.,101,,
526,0.97,3901.931,3902.331,Yes.,102,,
527,0.97,3902.331,3903.165,Chair Pedersen.,103,,
528,0.97,3903.165,3903.399,Yes.,104,,
529,0.97,3903.399,3905.001,"Five in favor, none opposed.",105,,
530,0.97,3905.001,3912.875,"Thank you, the motion carries, and amendment 1 as amended is approved.",106,,
531,0.97,3912.875,3918.814,"Now we're going to go onto amendment 2, which is also from Councilmember Strauss.",106,,
532,0.97,3918.814,3925.221,Then we're going to hear from amendment 3 from Councilmember Sawant.,106,,
533,0.97,3925.221,3931.06,"Councilmember Strauss, would you like to tell us about amendment 2, and then we can move it and get that before us?",106,,
534,0.97,3931.06,3932.061,"Yes, thank you, chair.",107,,
535,0.97,3932.061,3936.032,"Thank you, colleagues for letting me bring this to you this morning.",107,,
536,0.97,3936.032,3941.804,This is after additional conversations with many people in the community.,107,,
537,0.97,3941.804,3960.79,"We were trying to whether or to hold whether or not, I know as time changes, as information changes, and the environment changes, we have different decisions and things we need to be looking at to make our final decision.",107,,
538,0.97,3960.79,4006.335,"So section 3, this would add language that says the city supports Reexamining Ballard tunnel alignments that would better the center of the Hub village and 22nd Avenue Northwest while tunnel options West of 15th Avenue Northwest did not advance into the dies before project Scening, that was influenced by the Significanted anticipated cost difference between the elevated tunnel alliance as the Deis has shown a narrowing of the cost, Regoing tunnel may identify opportunities to reduce costs or better serve the anticipated Ridership.",107,,
539,0.97,4006.335,4009.538,I will say it will and better.,107,,
540,0.97,4009.538,4032.962,"So with that, chair, I understand the elected officials present during the level three screening of these options, from the present of the city of Seattle agreed to remove options West of 15th, and this was at a time when we were still considering a high level bridge.",107,,
541,0.97,4032.962,4036.065,We now know the high level bridge is not an option that we can move forward.,107,,
542,0.97,4036.065,4043.806,I believe we need to have a full understanding close to the heart of our Ridership core as possible.,107,,
543,0.97,4043.806,4047.109,All of the conversations about crossing 15th still stand.,107,,
544,0.97,4047.109,4054.417,We know that downtown Ballard has the strongest projected Ridership from sound transit analysis.,107,,
545,0.97,4054.417,4059.588,We know that it's the heart of the Commission core.,107,,
546,0.97,4059.588,4073.035,"We know it is higher opportunities for transportation development, and prior amendment West of 14th is bordering on an industrial scene.",107,,
547,0.97,4073.035,4076.572,We're not seeing those changes coming.,107,,
548,0.97,4076.572,4094.89,"Just with that, I want to open the conversation back to having analysis of what tunnel options are available to siding a station West of 15th, because I've heard from many during the level 3 analysis, Seattle Electeds took this off the table.",107,,
549,0.97,4094.89,4104.767,"I as a Seattle elected with new information, and changed environment, and requesting that we take a second look.",107,,
550,0.97,4104.767,4117.279,"I just understand that the engineering, and property costs will drive this decision, it's just that we need to have full information possible before making a decision as to where to site the station.",107,,
551,0.97,4117.279,4120.049,So I'm Agnostic about what street.,107,,
552,0.97,4120.049,4129.592,"I know we called out 22nd as one location, but I'm Agnostic as to what Street it really is, I just ask that we take a look.",107,,
553,0.97,4129.592,4133.295,"Thank you, chair.",108,,
554,0.97,4133.295,4134.83,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",109,,
555,0.97,4134.83,4144.206,"So I feel like this is in the spirit, we're already familiar with this concept of trying to move further West and there's a lot of support for that.",109,,
556,0.97,4144.206,4148.878,So it seems to meet the spirit of what's already before us.,109,,
557,0.97,4148.878,4149.645,So I'm supportive of this.,109,,
558,0.97,4149.645,4163.626,"I do want to hear from, to see whether city council central staff or Sdot want to have any comments on this particular amendment, and we'll get comments from them on amendment 3 as well.",109,,
559,0.97,4163.626,4180.543,"So I just wanted to see if central staff, or Sdot have any comments on this, and open the floor up from other Councilmembers, and we'll also do the Parliamently procedure.",109,,
560,0.97,4180.543,4182.578,I may wish to speak to it.,110,,
561,0.97,4182.578,4188.918,"Thank you, Yeah, I'll just say a couple words.",111,,
562,0.97,4188.918,4209.972,"I just want to appreciate Councilmember Strauss's comments and state that they are an accurate reflection of what the departmental, and executive staff have heard through community engagement during the Deis period, and even earlier from community about a better desire to serve the heart of Ballard, which is the fastest growing neighborhood in the city.",111,,
563,0.97,4209.972,4217.112,It's also accurate that there is new information that could prompt a reconsideration of alternatives that would be further West.,111,,
564,0.97,4217.112,4226.555,I do want to point out that the amendment language does not change the draft city position for an alternative on 15th.,111,,
565,0.97,4226.555,4238.834,"But it does demonstrate that 15th is in and of itself, a compromise from earlier options that would have been further West, and would have better served the Ballard community.",111,,
566,0.97,4238.834,4239.201,Thank you.,112,,
567,0.97,4239.201,4246.742,"Councilmember Strauss, would you like to go ahead and move your amendment too?",112,,
568,0.97,4246.742,4247.743,I'd love to.,113,,
569,0.97,4247.743,4255.217,I move to pass amendment 2 to resolution 32055.,113,,
570,0.97,4255.217,4255.784,Second.,114,,
571,0.97,4255.784,4272.501,Okay it's been moved and Seconded to amendment resolution 32055 with amendment 2. I appreciate that being shared on the screen earlier for the public in this recorded committee meeting.,114,,
572,0.97,4272.501,4283.379,"Councilmembers, committee members, any other comments on amendment 2 to resolution 32055 before we vote on it?",114,,
573,0.97,4283.379,4297.826,"Okay, will the clerk please call the role on amending resolution 32055 with amendment 2 as presented?",114,,
574,0.97,4297.826,4299.862,Councilmember Herbold?,115,,
575,0.97,4299.862,4300.996,Yes.,116,,
576,0.97,4300.996,4303.732,Councilmember Morales?,117,,
577,0.97,4303.732,4304.166,Yes.,118,,
578,0.97,4304.166,4305.668,Councilmember Sawant?,119,,
579,0.97,4305.668,4307.236,Yes.,120,,
580,0.97,4307.236,4307.803,Councilmember Strauss.,121,,
581,0.97,4307.803,4308.404,Yes.,122,,
582,0.97,4308.404,4309.405,Chair Pedersen.,123,,
583,0.97,4309.405,4309.638,Yes.,124,,
584,0.97,4309.638,4313.175,"Five in favor, none opposed.",125,,
585,0.97,4313.175,4320.749,"Thank you, the amendment 2 passes, and is now part of resolution 32055 as amended.",126,,
586,0.97,4320.749,4329.124,Now we're going to go to Amendmently which was recommended by Councilmember Sawant.,126,,
587,0.97,4329.124,4339.134,"Councilmember is a want, would you like to speak to amendment 3, to resolution 32055.",126,,
588,0.97,4339.134,4342.037,"Thank you, chair Pedersen, I apologize.",127,,
589,0.97,4342.037,4349.845,"As you stated correctly, this amendment was circulated by my office earlier this morning.",127,,
590,0.97,4349.845,4354.45,It's and amendment my office is moving at the request of Seattle subway.,127,,
591,0.97,4354.45,4370.232,"It makes simple changes to several lines of the resolution in section 1, subsection B, it adds language to Prioritize designs that shorten the time it takes to get to and from the light rail trains.",127,,
592,0.97,4370.232,4374.403,"Essentially, the more often they will do so.",127,,
593,0.97,4374.403,4383.078,Subsection 5 seeks to maximize public use of the trains and minimize costs by using public land where reasonable.,127,,
594,0.97,4383.078,4392.121,"Subsection G emphasizes the importance of future expansion of the light rail system, and supports design that will accommodate that.",127,,
595,0.97,4392.121,4405.734,"As I said, I'm moving this amendment, which has many of these items at the request of Seattle subway, but I wanted to add that preparing for future expansion is also something I strongly support.",127,,
596,0.97,4405.734,4418.313,"In section 2, subsection D, the amendment Civilly advocates for preparing for future expansion by building in South [inaudible] which essentially are places that the tracks can be connected to new lines.",127,,
597,0.97,4418.313,4426.021,The remainder of the amendment advocates for a shallow cart and cover station in the Cib rather than a deep cart station.,127,,
598,0.97,4426.021,4440.302,"Seattle subway has argued that this will make the station far more useable, because it will significantly reduce the time on Escalators, and make for easy transfers to other lights.",127,,
599,0.97,4440.302,4461.457,"These amendments have not yet been reviewed by the city attorney office, but I expect it would probably make sense to raise them for discussion and move them for a vote later, until committee chair and others feel they're ready to vote on this now, in which case, that would be great.",127,,
600,0.97,4461.457,4468.33,"Seattle subway has strongly advocated for expanding light rail, which I think is extremely important.",127,,
601,0.97,4468.33,4474.803,"Many are technical in nature, and I do not claim to be an expert.",127,,
602,0.97,4474.803,4486.615,"However, the principle that we advocate for making the light rail as easy to expand as possible, and preparing for future expansions is something I strongly support.",127,,
603,0.97,4486.615,4489.718,"There are amendments, their proposed amendments make sense to me.",127,,
604,0.97,4489.718,4504.666,"So I support the recommendations to make that possible, and I thank Seattle subway for all the work that they do including their activism.",127,,
605,0.97,4504.666,4516.645,"As we did with amendment 2, we'll hear whether our city central staff or Seattle Department of transportation city's designated representative have comments on this.",128,,
606,0.97,4516.645,4530.959,I definitely support the concept of being mindful of future Proofing the system so that it can further expand beyond sound transit 3 in the future.,128,,
607,0.97,4530.959,4536.999,I'm struggling with some of these details just because I appreciate the amendment being circulated in advance of committee.,128,,
608,0.97,4536.999,4548.71,"At the same time, it's a little more complex than the previous amendment which was working on sort of a similar issue.",128,,
609,0.97,4548.71,4559.321,"But wanted to hear from, see if Calvin chow, or Sara Maxwell have any comments before we can get comments from Councilmembers?",128,,
610,0.97,4559.321,4567.262,I think Sara would be best positioned to respond.,129,,
611,0.97,4567.262,4567.529,Okay.,130,,
612,0.97,4567.529,4567.996,Thank you.,131,,
613,0.97,4567.996,4582.544,"Yes, first, the language was distributed this morning, so I haven't had much of a chance to fully Digest or evaluate it, but at a high level could offer a couple comments that might be useful.",131,,
614,0.97,4582.544,4593.722,First I want to absolutely second what's been said a couple of times that the principles and the intention behind these amendments are consistent entirely with the city's work on this project.,131,,
615,0.97,4593.722,4605.534,"It's some of the specific and more technical language that could potentially be problematic, or would benefit from additional review.",131,,
616,0.97,4605.534,4609.171,I'll mention a couple of things on some of the specific language.,131,,
617,0.97,4609.171,4611.773,The language that's been added to the list of core values.,131,,
618,0.97,4611.773,4628.657,The five values that are stated in the original text of the resolution are an accurate reflection of the lenses that Department staff used to develop the recommendation and resolution.,131,,
619,0.97,4628.657,4631.159,Listing additional values doesn't change that.,131,,
620,0.97,4631.159,4642.904,"Public space and adapted infrastructure, while these might be good intentions for the future of the project, were not used as Differentiators to develop this resolution.",131,,
621,0.97,4642.904,4654.85,"Certainly, language about those intentions could be relevant, but they were not used to inform this recommendation as key Differentiators of the alternatives.",131,,
622,0.97,4654.85,4686.615,"For the language related to the Cid alternatives, I do want to mention that three steps represented are an accurate representation of how city staff are talking for many months now, including during the Deis comment period, and in response to feedback we heard from Committee in workshops that we partnered with sound transit on.",131,,
623,0.97,4686.615,4696.058,Number 2 calls out for the development of modifications to the fourth and Fifth Avenue locations.,131,,
624,0.97,4696.058,4710.605,"So at best, the proposed amendment language is, would be redundant, and unnecessary, because step two already calls out the need for examining modifications.",131,,
625,0.97,4710.605,4723.919,"More than that, the intention behind number 2, that step of working with community to develop those modifications deliberately didn't call out specific.",131,,
626,0.97,4723.919,4732.394,Because Committee is asking repeatedly to develop Dhows concepts in a public process and not Predispose which ones are going to be viable.,131,,
627,0.97,4732.394,4774.703,"So this language in the amendment, and language under Midtown station that States that the city's preference would be to connect to this new concept that's being proposed for Cid without having studied it, or discussed with committee seems Presumptive, and problematic, but that all said, number 2 in that step already calls out for the development of modifications to the fourth and Fifth Avenue alternatives, and that process would include a study like this in that public process with this Committee.",131,,
628,0.97,4774.703,4778.073,"Finally, on the idea of future Proofing.",131,,
629,0.97,4778.073,4781.409,The intention is to make those adjustments now.,131,,
630,0.97,4781.409,4784.179,Make those investments now to prevent added cost later.,131,,
631,0.97,4784.179,4794.656,It makes a lot of sense on the so surface.,131,,
632,0.97,4794.656,4796.057,First future Proofing may not work.,131,,
633,0.97,4796.057,4801.863,The design was meant to be compatible with future light rail that was envisioned to use that tunnel at a later date.,131,,
634,0.97,4801.863,4808.637,"Unfortunately, the light rail that was put in that tunnel needed a different track height and gauge.",131,,
635,0.97,4808.637,4826.555,"All of that additional work, not only did it not save taxpayer money, as it was originally intended, but because those aspects needed to be resigned, and reconstructed, it added taxpayer burden.",131,,
636,0.97,4826.555,4831.593,"Second, these future Proofing concepts will add to the project.",131,,
637,0.97,4831.593,4841.136,"Because these are expansion to the regional system, this should be a regional cost to consider, not something that the city of Seattle should be Shouldering itself.",131,,
638,0.97,4841.136,4847.075,"For those reasons, we want additional time, and discussion, and deliberation before stating support.",131,,
639,0.97,4847.075,4847.375,Thank you.,131,,
640,0.97,4847.375,4866.761,"I could add just two things to that, especially on the idea of sort of the regional expansion, the sound transit plan, expansion calls for potentially extending the Ballard segment to the U district, and the West segment, potentially to Burien.",132,,
641,0.97,4866.761,4869.097,Those are the potential long term plans.,132,,
642,0.97,4869.097,4875.103,There is going to have to be some thought about what the spurs look like on the existing system.,132,,
643,0.97,4875.103,4901.63,"To put additional spurs elsewhere on the project, the cost is unknown, and sort of the impacts is unknown, but I just highlight that these are going to be fairly large structures as an example, the pine Street sub tunnel just to the east of Westlake was put into place so that the future construction to Capitol Hill would not have to stop service through downtown.",132,,
644,0.97,4901.63,4905.667,"So that was significant expense, a significant structure had to be put in there's.",132,,
645,0.97,4905.667,4919.881,"That was the level of structure for an additional spur, and because we wouldn't be doing it, you'd be doing it adjacent to the tunnel boring machine, it would probably have to be cut and cover construction as well.",132,,
646,0.97,4919.881,4925.787,So it would potentially have significant impacts on the surface.,132,,
647,0.97,4925.787,4926.288,These are significant.,132,,
648,0.97,4926.288,4934.396,This isn't just sort of putting a doorway in the station hall.,132,,
649,0.97,4934.396,4937.699,Thank you for that context.,133,,
650,0.97,4937.699,4942.137,"Colleagues, any other comments on this amendment?",133,,
651,0.97,4942.137,4942.637,Councilmember Strauss?,133,,
652,0.97,4942.637,4942.904,Sure.,134,,
653,0.97,4942.904,4948.443,"I appreciate this amendment, and the values are very similar to what I believe.",134,,
654,0.97,4948.443,4956.551,"My concern is in the language regarding section 2, just because of the level of specificity that is outside my district.",134,,
655,0.97,4956.551,4985.347,"If this was within my district, I could know exactly if I agreed or disagreed since I haven't done this outreach, I don't know and not having had the moment to do the research myself, I'm not quite comfortable voting on the sections of section 2. I appreciate Councilmember Sawant, so we didn't have to have as many votes today.",134,,
656,0.97,4985.347,4992.087,But is there an ability to split this amendment up?,134,,
657,0.97,4992.087,4993.321,Thank you for those comments.,135,,
658,0.97,4993.321,4997.826,Let me think about that for a second.,135,,
659,0.97,4997.826,5001.029,It might depend on comments from other colleagues.,135,,
660,0.97,5001.029,5001.93,Councilmember Morales.,135,,
661,0.97,5001.93,5010.638,"I first of all, want to thank Councilmember Sawant for bringing this forward so we could discuss it.",136,,
662,0.97,5010.638,5015.377,My office did have discussions with Seattle subway about this as well.,136,,
663,0.97,5015.377,5046.841,"While I agree with the issues that they're trying to address there, for example, you know, in the Cid, even the shallow options for fourth and fifth are still 75, 85 feet deep, and given the, in my opinion, egregious problems that sound transit is having with Escalators, having the shallow option be that deep is really problematic.",136,,
664,0.97,5046.841,5059.854,"So I agree with the notion that we need to see if it's possible to have something shallower so it's easy for people to get out of the station, and to the street level.",136,,
665,0.97,5059.854,5097.725,"I do think that the level of specificity in here does Predispose as Sara was saying, the extended engagement with folks in the Cid that is already being contemplated, and the sound transit has already agreed, and we're already, I guess I should say, we are ready requesting an additional 6 to 9 month community Engainment project with folks in the Cid so that we can identify, you know, what specifically the challenges are, and what additional alternatives folks in the community want to have considered.",136,,
666,0.97,5097.725,5114.976,"So for that reason, I think I appreciate the ability to have this conversation, but I do think that the amendment, or some parts of it probably need a little bit more work before we add them into the resolution.",136,,
667,0.97,5114.976,5119.981,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,137,,
668,0.97,5119.981,5124.986,Any other comments from committee colleagues?,137,,
669,0.97,5124.986,5131.593,"Chair Pedersen, can I just add something?",138,,
670,0.97,5131.593,5140.168,"Yes, Councilmember Sawant, unless Councilmember Herbold has something to add, and then you can address everybody's comments?",139,,
671,0.97,5140.168,5143.404,Would that be okay?,139,,
672,0.97,5143.404,5148.109,I'll be very brief.,140,,
673,0.97,5148.109,5150.879,I'm just now wrapping my arms around this.,140,,
674,0.97,5150.879,5164.559,"I appreciate the effort to bring to the committee that concerns that may not have been adequately addressed by Seattle subway, but I am intending to abstain at this point on this particular amendment.",140,,
675,0.97,5164.559,5166.494,Thanks.,140,,
676,0.97,5166.494,5168.696,Okay.,141,,
677,0.97,5168.696,5170.698,Thank you Councilmember Herbold for that comment.,141,,
678,0.97,5170.698,5181.776,"And Councilmember is a want, Sawant, would you like to address any of the comments made so far?",141,,
679,0.97,5181.776,5186.114,"Yes, I appreciate all the comments from the Department and Councilmembers.",142,,
680,0.97,5186.114,5205.099,"As I said in my introduction of this proposed amendment, I'm not necessarily asking for a vote today because it's not surprising that there are many questions, because there's a lot of details contained in the proposed amendment.",142,,
681,0.97,5205.099,5244.772,"And so I'm happy to not move the amendment today, but instead work with the Department of transportation staff to revise the language to prepare for the full city Council, and I also would urge Seattle subway to also be a part of those discussions because then I think that would be fruitful if my office and the Department of transportation and Seattle subway could have a meeting on this, and then we are able to prepare either one amendment, or maybe more than one amendment if that's the preference, to split them up.",142,,
682,0.97,5244.772,5250.678,"Also, I would urge other Council offices to be involved of course.",142,,
683,0.97,5250.678,5257.118,"Look at everything that has been raised so far, the office is making notes during this meeting.",142,,
684,0.97,5257.118,5270.365,"So we'll definitely take into account everything that's been raised thus far, but if there are any additional points then I really urge committee members to reach out to my office with those points and we'll take them into consideration.",142,,
685,0.97,5270.365,5275.403,"As I said, the principle of preparing for future expansion is what's important to us.",142,,
686,0.97,5275.403,5282.51,So let's figure out the details to be able.,142,,
687,0.97,5282.51,5284.078,Okay.,143,,
688,0.97,5284.078,5285.546,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,143,,
689,0.97,5285.546,5308.036,"Just for everybody viewing, I think there's wide ranging support for looking to the future, and making sure the decisions sound transit makes that are mindful to a future expansion, even beyond sound transit 3 and doesn't make decisions now that would include those options in the future.",143,,
690,0.97,5308.036,5325.153,"In the spirit of that I think is, needs to be, continued to be reinforced, and is already, a Sara said, already in some of the based discussions with sound transit and the Deis.",143,,
691,0.97,5325.153,5341.836,"Certainly Seattle subway and other organizations can continue to advocate with sound transit, and I believe they've submitted those comments through the regular Deis comment period process as well.",143,,
692,0.97,5341.836,5351.979,"I think what we'll do here, Councilmember Sawant, I hear you say not going to move it at this time, and you're going to regroup, and connect with Sdot on this.",143,,
693,0.97,5351.979,5360.121,"Yes, I think that's what makes the most sense.",144,,
694,0.97,5360.121,5360.388,Okay.,145,,
695,0.97,5360.388,5364.892,Well thank you very much.,145,,
696,0.97,5364.892,5389.016,"Colleagues, I think we've got our Amendmented resolution, 32055 before us that's been amended with amendment 1, and amendment to amendment 1. are there any comments on 32055 before the committee takes a vote?",145,,
697,0.97,5389.016,5403.264,"Okay, will the clerk please call the roll on adoption of 32055 as amended?",145,,
698,0.97,5403.264,5406.234,Councilmember H Herbold?,146,,
699,0.97,5406.234,5406.634,Yes.,147,,
700,0.97,5406.634,5408.369,Councilmember Morales?,148,,

703,0.97,5411.939,5413.241,Yes.,151,,

707,0.97,5415.91,5416.177,Yes.,155,,
708,0.97,5416.177,5416.444,5-0.,156,,
709,0.97,5416.444,5420.047,It can be as early as July 12th city council meeting.,157,,
710,0.97,5420.047,5437.832,"I want to thank everybody for their deep engagement in this, and I want to thank sound transit staff, Seattle Department of transportation staff, our central staff, everybody who's worked on this for really for years, and will continue to do so for years.",157,,
711,0.97,5437.832,5441.803,We're just stewards in the middle of this process right now.,157,,
712,0.97,5441.803,5447.442,Well that was our last item on our agenda.,157,,
713,0.97,5447.442,5455.183,"So colleagues, I'll go ahead and conclude the meeting.",157,,
714,0.97,5455.183,5459.353,"This concludes the July 5th, 2022 meeting of the transportation committee.",157,,
