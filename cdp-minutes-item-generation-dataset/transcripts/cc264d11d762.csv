116,0.97,915.147,946.011,"I don't see anything on the new agenda to address anything of the On-Going problems, doing city Councilmembers a favor in two years for election by looking back at last election and prohibiting most money that donates in opposition to Council Democrats guaranteeing a rigging of our democracy, prohibiting job creators for $500 an employ is fixing our democracy.",14,,
117,0.97,946.011,951.116,City Councilmembers leave early to do bidding of companies that buy them off.,14,,
118,0.97,951.116,986.118,"Now it is middle of winter, a storm, and city council is allowing the Mayor to mislead the people of Seattle about her Subhuman shelter that kick people out at the coldest part of the morning with wet shoes, no resources whatsoever, now city council wants to get in the news by international news by sympathizing with a terrorist that killed noble soldiers.",14,,
119,0.97,986.118,990.155,People are being questioned with torture.,14,,

126,0.97,1034.933,1060.592,I am here to support the resolution that our Councilmembership just introduced which is reaffirming Seattle as a welcoming city and exposing Seattle city council solidarity with the community regardless of religion and cast and opposing India's National register of citizens and amendment act.,15,,
127,0.97,1060.592,1076.375,"As a citizen of Seattle, a city that is seen around the world as a place for all communities, people of all religious and values living peacefully and in harmony.",15,,

129,0.97,1078.844,1097.629,And Express deep concerns on the rising hate and Facism in India that is reflected in this citizen that designed to strip the citizenship of two million people.,15,,
130,0.97,1097.629,1102.835,That would be the 5th largest country if they were to live in a separate country by itself.,15,,
131,0.97,1102.835,1119.418,"That is the amount of people at risk of losing their rights to vote for example, rights to make their--have their say in the democratic process in India.",15,,
132,0.97,1119.418,1129.628,And also in a country where maintaining birth records is impossible to prove your citizenship you have to get your father's birth certificate from 70 years back.,15,,
133,0.97,1129.628,1138.37,More than half of the people don't have any physical records of citizenship in India.,15,,
134,0.97,1138.37,1141.64,It is a law that will Marginalize a large number of people.,15,,
135,0.97,1141.64,1150.516,I am here to strongly support the resolution that is being proposed.,15,,
136,0.97,1150.516,1151.45,Thank you very much.,15,,

140,0.97,1171.837,1180.179,My biggest issue is that--everyone is guilty by default unless they prove it otherwise.,16,,
141,0.97,1180.179,1198.83,"This is--and then the law will proceed to treat them worse than convicted criminals, they will be sent to centers where there are no human right practices.",16,,
142,0.97,1198.83,1202.367,"It will include children, women and seniors.",16,,
143,0.97,1202.367,1233.932,When I tell people this they are horrified and they equate it with Germany's law because it also curtails people's right to vote because the government officials can define if you are a citizen or not.,16,,
144,0.97,1233.932,1243.475,This actually marginalized community that have no way to paper and Lbgtq and women who do not have property rights and they don't have access to the same documents.,16,,
145,0.97,1243.475,1247.98,It is going to impact millions of lives on our watch.,16,,
146,0.97,1247.98,1254.886,So I propose that we should adopt this resolution.,16,,

212,0.97,1709.974,1712.444,These are called super packs for a reason.,26,,
213,0.97,1712.444,1722.52,That is because they are able to accept donations of a size that would be considered corrupting if they were given directly to a candidate's campaign.,26,,
214,0.97,1722.52,1732.53,Yet they are used for the same purpose and nothing in the law Precludes the contributor from talking to the candidate and making it clear that the support has been delivered.,26,,
215,0.97,1732.53,1740.138,I want to point out that the Supreme Court did not create super packs that was done by a lower court.,26,,
216,0.97,1740.138,1743.341,It could be overturned without a constitutional convention.,26,,
217,0.97,1743.341,1751.983,And there are very smart lawyers as mentioned by Cindy who think that the successful case could be made for overturning that decision.,26,,

259,0.97,2030.328,2057.288,"This changes the title of section 7 from limits on expenditures to independent expenditure committees to simply independent expenditures, this is an amendment to ensure that foreign influence corporations would not be able to simply make political expenditures themselves.",48,,
260,0.97,2057.288,2073.805,The bill as drafted focuses on foreign influence corporations to independent expenditure committees so there is definitely another loophole that would be useful to close.,48,,
261,0.97,2073.805,2075.44,Any comments?,48,,
262,0.97,2075.44,2080.545,"Seeing no comments, those in favor please vote.",48,,

265,0.97,2099.997,2120.585,We know that out of the 20 largest corporations in 2019 at least 7 of those 20 could have met the definition of a foreign influence corporation.,48,,
266,0.97,2120.585,2137.135,Federal law and judicial and bars from spending money to influence U.S. elections this is true if they attempt to influence U.S. elections in their personal capacity or through a corporation.,48,,
267,0.97,2137.135,2142.64,Foreign investors own increasing shares of U.S.,48,,
268,0.97,2142.64,2149.881,Corporate stock from 5% in 1982 to approximately 35% in 2017.,48,,
269,0.97,2149.881,2161.893,Foreign interests can Diverge from U.S. interests that is a true nationally and true locally.,48,,
270,0.97,2161.893,2169.567,"The areas of tax, trade, investment and labor law there are often divergent interests.",48,,
271,0.97,2169.567,2184.382,Corporate directors and managers view themselves as accountable to their Stakeholders including foreign Stakeholders and a quote from a former Ceo of U.S.-Based Exxon mobile stated I am not a U.S.,48,,

274,0.97,2210.775,2222.253,And services and the business round table concurred that 1% is the threshold at which a single shareholder is able to influence significant corporate decisions.,48,,
275,0.97,2222.253,2235.199,One of the most important campaign finance limits that we have is that foreign nationals are absolutely barred from spending directly or indirectly in U.S. elections at any political level.,48,,
276,0.97,2235.199,2235.9,"Federal, state, or city.",48,,
277,0.97,2235.9,2246.444,Thus it defies logic to allow groups of foreign nationals or foreign nationals in combination with American citizens to fund political spending through corporations.,48,,
278,0.97,2246.444,2253.584,One cannot have a right collectively that one does not have individually.,48,,

293,0.97,2373.17,2397.862,"And defines a public communication as a paid advertisement that is intended to influence legislation or influence an elected official's opinion on legislation, we are speaking to the need of the legislation, we know that only 5% of the contributions to packs made contributions over $5,000.",53,,
294,0.97,2397.862,2406.47,Though those contributions accounted for almost 85% of the total money packs collected in 2019.,53,,
295,0.97,2406.47,2413.577,And with that if there are other thoughts on this bill I would welcome hearing them now.,53,,
296,0.97,2413.577,2435.332,"I just want to say thank you to Gonzalaz and Thomas, we know transparency and light when shown on the legislative process in government is a good thing and brings the accountability to the people of our city and whom we serve.",54,,

313,0.97,2565.462,2575.406,Trump's policies towards Iran include air strikes in the assassination of Soleimani are risking war and it is totally unacceptable.,60,,
314,0.97,2575.406,2616.614,"The U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq we have seen have not expanded the freedom democracies or safety of ordinary people in Middle East, have not increased the safety of people in the United States, instead they have caused massive loss of human life and ongoing suffering in Afghanistan and Iraq and for U.S. soldiers, ordinary people, especially women, young people and the Marganialize that pay the price for the war.",60,,

319,0.97,2651.248,2662.559,"To war with Iraq in Stretchy reports with no details, it was shocking, actually, to find that the resolution that was passed in 2003 did not actually oppose the war in any way.",60,,
320,0.97,2662.559,2671.668,I think that we need to set a different precedent for the city Council to take a stand against any kind of military aggression.,60,,
321,0.97,2671.668,2679.476,"Because we know it will be--it will not favor the safety and security of our country, either.",60,,
