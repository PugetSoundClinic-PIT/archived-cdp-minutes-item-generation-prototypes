49,0.97,295.561,313.312,"We worked with the Mayor's office to allow library staff to be eligible for the Covid-19 vaccines a bit earlier so we could safely return to In- building services, protecting our staff and the public coming in.",19,,
50,0.97,313.312,329.228,"By the end of April, the library reopened its first three branches for In-Building services and by the end of the second quarter, we had added an additional 13 branches and essential library building, for a total of 17 branches open to services.",19,,

59,0.97,383.282,402.268,"Within of the accomplishments was that we brought on, particularly with Rsji change team, worked really hard to bring on a consulting firm who is Equity-Focused.",20,,
60,0.97,402.268,415.148,They have brought on a presentation related with the National 2021 staff meet back in April of 2021.,20,,

62,0.97,432.465,433.533,So it was really good.,20,,
63,0.97,433.533,450.483,And our change team is also working continuously with the founder of the epiphany of equity to bring on additional training for the staff.,20,,

66,0.97,480.546,490.389,"So we began developing an equity road map, which we will continue to work on and plan to roll this out throughout the library this year.",20,,

73,0.97,565.064,572.939,The pandemic definitely played a critical and very challenging role in terms of delivering our services.,20,,
74,0.97,572.939,591.757,"Because we were so stretched, particularly at with the reduction of our budget, and you know, focusing on the reopening of our facilities, one of the thing like In-Person community engagement was completely disrupted.",20,,
75,0.97,591.757,602.134,"We are resuming that work in 2022, especially as we begin the work of the strategic planning process under our new chief librarian.",20,,

165,0.97,1636.768,1652.617,"When we did the opening, the new opening two years ago of Lake City, and everyone's hair was on fire that you're eliminating fines, how dare you, Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah.",33,,
166,0.97,1652.617,1655.553,What we thought happened did happen: it got better.,33,,
167,0.97,1655.553,1659.657,The whole hope is the library is the people's University.,33,,
168,0.97,1659.657,1667.065,"More access, more equity is what we are supposed to be doing.",33,,
169,0.97,1667.065,1668.933,Thank you for that.,33,,
170,0.97,1668.933,1674.339,"Of course, if you can keep on top of the Statistics of that, that would be great.",33,,
171,0.97,1674.339,1678.676,We have three libraries in district five and they are used a lot.,33,,
172,0.97,1678.676,1688.353,You guys were great during the pandemic opening your doors so people could come in.,33,,
173,0.97,1688.353,1697.929,"Just the things that you have done, some of it wasn't quite library services but you did it like the park people did at community centers.",33,,
174,0.97,1697.929,1702.634,"We have all taken on different job responsibilities because of the pandemic, so I want to thank you for that.",33,,
175,0.97,1702.634,1708.64,I know you guys work really hard and I just want to acknowledge that.,33,,
176,0.97,1708.64,1713.011,You're in good hands with Councilmember Lewis.,33,,

178,0.97,1716.281,1719.851,Thank you.,35,,
179,0.97,1719.851,1720.351,Councilmember Morales?,35,,
180,0.97,1720.351,1720.985,"Thank you, chair.",36,,
181,0.97,1720.985,1723.955,I also want to thank all of you for this work.,36,,
182,0.97,1723.955,1733.198,There's been a lot happening for everybody the last few years and I know the staff has been going the extra mile as the Council President said.,36,,
183,0.97,1733.198,1744.709,"I have a question about that, one of the slides addressing the challenges of, you know, staff being fatigued by the compounding challenges.",36,,
184,0.97,1744.709,1756.254,I know doing this kind of race and social justice work is itself pretty emotionally taxing and exhausting work.,36,,
185,0.97,1756.254,1766.464,"I wonder if you could talk about your current staffing, and what supports staff who are charged with doing this work might have.",36,,
186,0.97,1766.464,1766.931,That's one question.,36,,
187,0.97,1766.931,1784.215,Then I would like to learn more about the organizations you mentioned in the South end and some of the outcomes that you have had from there.,36,,
188,0.97,1784.215,1784.482,Sure.,37,,
189,0.97,1784.482,1800.365,"Yes, I agree the staff who do this work, especially the heavy engagement and equity work, they are often people or color as well and have an additional emotional burden that comes with that work.",37,,
190,0.97,1800.365,1805.57,Also may be experiencing the same things as those communities.,37,,
191,0.97,1805.57,1806.271,We do realize that.,37,,
192,0.97,1806.271,1816.714,We try to provide a lot of flexibility in how the program managers were working during the pandemic because it was impossible to try and meet In- person.,37,,
193,0.97,1816.714,1829.894,"So making sure they had full access to work from home capabilities et cetera, to try and maintain those engagements.",37,,
194,0.97,1829.894,1831.462,The staff have experienced a lot during this time.,37,,
195,0.97,1831.462,1838.403,We know a number of issues we have seen within the branches have increased.,37,,
196,0.97,1838.403,1846.644,"Those things can be mental health issues, drug addiction issues and everything in between.",37,,
197,0.97,1846.644,1851.115,Sometimes the violence is directed at them or Harassment directed at them.,37,,
198,0.97,1851.115,1869.133,"One of the things we have been working on here is with our staff support group, working to develop a trauma and formal care package that includes an internal Website and also other tools.",37,,
199,0.97,1869.133,1889.587,"Building because of an incident and if folks are traumatized or if someone was injured or something like that, making sure we have all the tools at their disposal that will help guide them through whatever that recovery process is.",37,,
200,0.97,1889.587,1897.028,"Looking at additional peer to peer support in the Online peer forum process as well, much left to do in that area.",37,,
201,0.97,1897.028,1903.501,"We are trying to be better at this and have learned a lot during the pandemic, and continue to learn more.",37,,
202,0.97,1903.501,1909.407,We have a great staff working on this as we speak.,37,,
203,0.97,1909.407,1913.044,"The bloom project, Councilmember, I don't have a lot more details today.",37,,
204,0.97,1913.044,1930.061,"But if you have those questions, I can certainly get them back to your office.",37,,
205,0.97,1934.198,1934.532,Any follow-up?,38,,
206,0.97,1934.532,1934.766,Great.,38,,
207,0.97,1934.766,1946.511,I have a question on the discussion of potential revisions to rules of conduct reassessment of rules of conduct.,38,,
208,0.97,1946.511,1953.051,Is there a particular area of focus for Re-Examining library rules of conduct?,38,,
209,0.97,1953.051,1975.239,"And I also want to ask in terms of the implication for library staff and personnel, in terms of enforcing rules of conduct and what kind of supplementary training you may anticipate for staff to be prepared as branches are opening.",38,,
210,0.97,1975.239,1979.577,Could you expand on that as a 2022 item?,38,,
211,0.97,1979.577,1988.453,That is one of those items we are using the racial equity tool kit and will likely use consulting partner to help us through that.,39,,
212,0.97,1988.453,1993.658,There will be a staff team put together to move us through that as well.,39,,
213,0.97,1993.658,1997.028,Our goal is to keep people in the library.,39,,
214,0.97,1997.028,2009.507,"As we look at our staff and security, when we have interactions that may not be going well, we have a lot of Deescalation tools and training at our side.",39,,
215,0.97,2009.507,2010.274,Our staff implement those daily.,39,,
216,0.97,2010.274,2023.421,"When we talk about the rules of conduct, one of the things we want to look at, do they have disparate effects on people of color?",39,,
217,0.97,2023.421,2036.067,Are there elements of the rules of conduct that actually escalate situations instead of Deescalate?,39,,
218,0.97,2036.067,2040.038,Are there rules Maybe we no longer need apply?,39,,
219,0.97,2040.038,2060.725,And I use simple examples of something we did a few years ago when we had so many teens being excluded at the Rainier Beach branch.,39,,
220,0.97,2060.725,2066.998,"We looked at the rule of conduct being violated, and it was eating.",39,,
221,0.97,2066.998,2073.037,"So Wents, when we redesign the building, put in an area where teens can eat.",39,,
222,0.97,2073.037,2083.614,"That took those rules of conduct down 25% to 30% and kept teens in the building, where we wanted them, and where they wanted to be.",39,,
223,0.97,2083.614,2087.185,Otherwise they wouldn't be in the building.,39,,
224,0.97,2087.185,2106.103,"Being able to look at this Holistically, there could be a number of ways to bring down those exclusions but also bring down some issues that also escalate into bigger issues.",39,,
225,0.97,2106.103,2115.279,"Tom, I really appreciate that anecdote about the analysis about why so many young people are being excluded.",40,,
226,0.97,2115.279,2119.617,We want desperately for our young people to be in the library.,40,,
227,0.97,2119.617,2144.408,"Breaking barriers down to be sure we can facilitate that and analyze what rules of conduct we are putting out there that are Prettying barriers and ignoring ways to figure out how to accommodate or solve for them is really critical Workability as you go forward and do this in 2022, I would love to stay in touch about how I can support it.",40,,
228,0.97,2144.408,2172.069,"When I worked at King County, I'd been involved in efforts around looking at sort of similar things like how school discipline leads to school to prison pipeline, leads to excluding young people from wholesome Someplaces, libraries, public spaces, and depriving them by banning them.",40,,
229,0.97,2172.069,2176.874,Just keeping that open is a critical part of the foundation of the work we do as a city.,40,,
230,0.97,2176.874,2180.945,Thank you for that analysis of that work.,40,,
231,0.97,2180.945,2183.214,Councilmember Morales?,40,,
232,0.97,2183.214,2196.827,"I just wanted to echo what you said, which was how important it is to understand, particularly in Underresourced communities, the impact of things like food insecurity.",41,,
233,0.97,2196.827,2213.477,"I mean, this was an issue, this issue of kids, you know, trying to access food.",41,,
234,0.97,2264.562,2268.232,"I'm going to see you, I believe tomorrow evening.",42,,
235,0.97,2268.232,2270.167,Very much looking forward to that.,42,,
236,0.97,2270.167,2276.24,And I want to thank the panel and appreciate the presentation.,42,,
237,0.97,2276.24,2284.949,We will send follow-ups on the presentation as we get them down in an E-mail.,42,,
238,0.97,2284.949,2286.25,Thank you so much.,42,,
239,0.97,2286.25,2287.385,Thank you.,43,,
240,0.97,2287.385,2287.985,All right.,44,,
241,0.97,2287.985,2293.324,"Council colleagues, that is our only item of business for this afternoon.",44,,
242,0.97,2293.324,2297.862,Is there any further business before the committee before we adjourn?,44,,
243,0.97,2297.862,2300.564,"Seeing none, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon.",44,,
