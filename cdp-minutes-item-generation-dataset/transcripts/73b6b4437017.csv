195,0.97,1200.232,1207.973,We will flag I'm putting forward a couple of amendments myself.,19,,
196,0.97,1207.973,1217.249,Mostly dealing with resolving the left on security and casework questions from last week's discussion.,19,,
197,0.97,1217.249,1219.818,I believe that Councilmember Pedersen has some on that as well.,19,,
198,0.97,1219.818,1229.127,We should make sure the questions are answer and I look forward to our deliberations on that this afternoon.,19,,
199,0.97,1229.127,1234.933,I am happy to make myself available if folks want to talk.,19,,

201,0.97,1238.237,1244.743,And hopefully getting something really good passed this afternoon.,19,,
202,0.97,1244.743,1250.015,"Last week in district 7, we had our third in district office hours session.",19,,
203,0.97,1250.015,1254.319,"We held office hours in uptown, Belltown.",19,,
204,0.97,1254.319,1256.722,And the Queen Anne neighborhood.,19,,
205,0.97,1256.722,1265.43,One of the dominant themes from last Thursday was traffic calming on tenth Avenue West and Queen Anne.,19,,
206,0.97,1265.43,1277.476,A constituent relayed that they had witnessed the 13-Year-Old daughter of their neighbor be hit by a vehicle at 10th and Howell resulting in her leg being broken.,19,,
207,0.97,1277.476,1281.913,She is fully recovered but that could have been far more serious.,19,,
208,0.97,1281.913,1291.556,"Another constituent relayed to me in the past, a car speeding down 10th Avenue West had flipped over into their front yard.",19,,
209,0.97,1291.556,1302.334,"In addition to other really serious accidents on 10th Avenue West, there's previously been a traffic study that Sdot conducted.",19,,
210,0.97,1302.334,1306.338,A 30 miles an hour zone.,19,,
211,0.97,1306.338,1309.341,The highest speed clocked there was 67 miles an hour.,19,,
212,0.97,1309.341,1315.314,This is a really serious concern for me.,19,,
213,0.97,1315.314,1319.418,It has been raised by many constituents not yet organized together.,19,,
214,0.97,1319.418,1328.56,I have recommended that maybe they could be and I'm happy to help facilitate that to agitate and organize for some action on traffic calming.,19,,
215,0.97,1328.56,1339.604,I raised these concerns with Sdot multiple times and look forward to Continueing to do so since there is a very steady drum beat of concern on this particular arterial.,19,,
216,0.97,1339.604,1341.74,That will continue to be a big issue for me.,19,,
217,0.97,1341.74,1355.821,I don't want to see any further injuries to pedestrians or Bicyclists in that corridor or any corridor in the city and look forward to continuing the conversation as we all strive to reach vision zero in the city.,19,,
218,0.97,1355.821,1366.331,"More broadly, we have been advertising our office hours through our social media platforms and our weekly newsletter.",19,,
219,0.97,1366.331,1377.576,"Through Google ads as well, working with Joseph P. on central staff to try to boost the circulation of our office hours.",19,,
220,0.97,1377.576,1381.98,I can report that actually seems to have resulted in a lot of additional signups.,19,,
221,0.97,1381.98,1387.119,A lot of people are showing up and we don't have gaps in the signups for appointments.,19,,
222,0.97,1387.119,1408.24,People coming who have never tried to meet with their Councilmember before and didn't know how how or how it would lead to anything or get their issues in front of someone who could share their stories with my colleagues and with the Departments of the city.,19,,
223,0.97,1408.24,1410.175,That has been a great experience.,19,,
224,0.97,1410.175,1419.317,"For those watching at home, this week's session for office hours will be in the South Lake Union neighborhood.",19,,

227,0.97,1430.729,1438.804,"I will be visiting the neighborhood Council tomorrow night, a neighborhood within the South Lake Union neighborhood on February 19th.",19,,

229,0.97,1446.144,1456.054,It will be the sixth for my office since my director has always visited the Queen Anne and West edge councils during nights where I had conflicts.,19,,
230,0.97,1456.054,1464.563,I look forward to attending those community Council this month or perhaps next month.,19,,
231,0.97,1464.563,1474.339,Just making sure we continue to communicate we want to be a resource and a partner to our neighbors all over the district.,19,,
232,0.97,1474.339,1478.143,Are you done?,20,,
233,0.97,1478.143,1478.443,No.,21,,
234,0.97,1478.443,1478.743,"Sorry, yes.",21,,
235,0.97,1478.743,1479.177,Thank you so much.,21,,
236,0.97,1479.177,1481.313,I have a couple of points to make.,22,,
237,0.97,1481.313,1501.5,"First of all, you do not know how happy it makes me to hear people taking on, those of us representing districts, that we have district offices and hours and directors.",22,,
238,0.97,1501.5,1508.373,"As Councilmember Herbold knows, people thought it would be bulk and we wouldn't all be working together but against each other but I think it is the opposite.",22,,
239,0.97,1508.373,1515.447,I think we all know we represent the city of Seattle but honor the needs of our district.,22,,
240,0.97,1515.447,1521.486,"It is not just the global, regional, and national issues.",22,,
241,0.97,1521.486,1526.591,But what is going on with density?,22,,
242,0.97,1526.591,1526.858,Potholes?,22,,
243,0.97,1526.858,1527.659,Because we physically live there.,22,,
244,0.97,1527.659,1534.332,I am a big cheer leader of that as you all know.,22,,
245,0.97,1534.332,1538.236,"Cancellus, Councilmember Lewis.",22,,
246,0.97,1538.236,1547.145,"I want to ask you if we can talk Offline, but I want to get into a few phone calls for the viewing public.",22,,
247,0.97,1547.145,1550.315,Are any of these amendments dealt with specifically in committee?,22,,
248,0.97,1550.315,1552.117,Or in any way?,22,,
249,0.97,1552.117,1552.417,Yes.,23,,
250,0.97,1552.417,1552.617,So --,23,,
251,0.97,1552.617,1561.192,If you could flag those for me and some other folks so we know what we have to Revisit?,24,,
252,0.97,1561.192,1566.231,The amendments dealing with security and casework had been discussed in committee.,25,,
253,0.97,1566.231,1577.809,There had been some potential issues raised that those amendments did not meet the practices of the current service providers or exactly the language of the human services Department.,25,,
254,0.97,1577.809,1589.387,"So, we needed to spend another week to grapple more to make sure we weren't being too prescriptive adding another requirement beyond what Hsd requires.",25,,
255,0.97,1589.387,1590.355,So we delayed that conversation.,25,,
256,0.97,1590.355,1597.162,"In terms of some of the other ones, most of the amendments just clean up a couple of issues.",25,,
257,0.97,1597.162,1608.206,One of the amendments I'm proposing is to add modular buildings to the definition of the kind of structures that can go in a transitional encampment.,25,,
258,0.97,1608.206,1609.207,That wasn't necessarily explicit.,25,,
259,0.97,1609.207,1612.544,Or isn't necessarily explicit in the ordinance as it stands.,25,,
260,0.97,1612.544,1631.596,"And, it was particularly concerning to central staff given that chief Seattle club is recently opened a very well designed modular shelter and wanted to make sure Encampments like that could be included.",25,,
261,0.97,1631.596,1634.666,Councilmember Pedersen has introduced a couple of amendments.,25,,
262,0.97,1634.666,1639.637,I would rather have him speak to.,25,,
263,0.97,1639.637,1665.03,The substitute bill under Councilmember Sawant's name is basically just updating the ordinance to 2020 because the old ordinance had a signature line for 2019 and Formatted as if it was an ordinance in 2019 so that just cleans that up and update it is Formatting.,25,,
264,0.97,1665.03,1669.667,Central staff had offered to put the substitute under my name.,25,,
265,0.97,1669.667,1674.339,It is under Councilmember Sawant as an amendment though I totally concur in it.,25,,
266,0.97,1674.339,1675.306,Her substitute bill?,25,,
267,0.97,1675.306,1676.975,In her substitute bill.,26,,
268,0.97,1676.975,1677.175,Yes.,26,,
269,0.97,1677.175,1684.115,"So, I'm just letting everyone know now, that we have nine amendments to get through this afternoon.",27,,
270,0.97,1684.115,1698.196,"I ask all of you be prepared to speak to each amendment and we move through it and have some good civil discussion that is robust, but at the same time, that we are respectful of each other's opinions.",27,,
271,0.97,1698.196,1704.436,Sometimes it gets a little heated but that's okay as long as we are kind and respectful.,27,,
272,0.97,1704.436,1708.64,We have nine amendments Andly not be here until 5:00 or 4:00.,27,,
273,0.97,1708.64,1711.576,We will go through them.,27,,
274,0.97,1711.576,1714.245,"So, with that, Councilmember Herbold who has been smiling at me the whole time.",27,,
275,0.97,1714.245,1716.481,I'm confident we will get it done.,28,,
276,0.97,1716.481,1721.453,And get out of here by 5:00 with your effective leadership.,28,,
277,0.97,1721.453,1728.927,I have my lucky Ruth Ginsberg shirt on today.,29,,
278,0.97,1728.927,1733.565,I have two items on the full council agenda.,30,,
279,0.97,1733.565,1735.567,We will go through them quickly.,30,,
280,0.97,1735.567,1742.34,One is a new appointment to the community police Commission.,30,,
281,0.97,1742.34,1745.877,"And, the other is a reappointment.",30,,
282,0.97,1745.877,1746.744,Colleen is the reappointment.,30,,
283,0.97,1746.744,1754.285,And the Mayor is a t appointing authority.,30,,
284,0.97,1754.285,1759.257,Those are the only items I have on full council today.,30,,
285,0.97,1759.257,1765.864,I do not have a public safety meeting this week though I have one next Tuesday at 9:30.,30,,
286,0.97,1765.864,1773.438,"And then, just a couple of letters I wanted to talk to you about.",30,,
287,0.97,1773.438,1783.114,Council President Gonzalez has asked I on her behalf distribute a letter for signature.,30,,
288,0.97,1783.114,1791.89,This is a piece of legislation in support of a bill before the state Legislature.,30,,
289,0.97,1791.89,1792.59,House bill 2567.,30,,

294,0.97,1812.21,1816.014,These measures build community trust in local courts.,30,,
295,0.97,1816.014,1822.053,Prohibit immigration agents from interfering in local court functioning and preserve access to our courts for everyone.,30,,
296,0.97,1822.053,1829.027,"In both rural and urban areas across Washington, courthouse Haves become front lines in immigration enforcement.",30,,
297,0.97,1829.027,1841.94,Civil Arests at Washington Courthouses particularly immigration arrests have created a climate of fear that is deterring and preventing Washington residents from safely interacting with the justice system.,30,,
298,0.97,1841.94,1853.117,"Since January 2018, there have been over 200 documented civil arrests of immigrants at Courthouses in 18 counties across Washington.",30,,
299,0.97,1853.117,1855.72,"Nearly 1 million Washingtonians, one in seven people are immigrants.",30,,
300,0.97,1855.72,1865.997,Immigrants and their families are being deterred from appearing in state courts by an aggressive Federal immigration force often acting in plain clothes.,30,,
301,0.97,1865.997,1872.437,Spreading fear in immigrant communities by sitting in court and arresting people in and around Courthouses.,30,,

304,0.97,1896.761,1899.33,I will distribute it now.,30,,

306,0.97,1903.301,1904.002,At full council.,30,,
307,0.97,1904.002,1907.872,This is a letter you received I believe on Saturday.,30,,
308,0.97,1907.872,1908.273,This weekend.,30,,
309,0.97,1908.273,1909.707,"Actually, I take it back.",30,,
310,0.97,1909.707,1911.042,It was on Sunday.,30,,
311,0.97,1911.042,1918.983,"And, this is a letter regarding the ongoing negotiations between the executive.",30,,
312,0.97,1918.983,1926.157,And the law enforcement assisted diverse program for funding.,30,,
313,0.97,1926.157,1935.9,The letter itself is a Follow- up letter to the letter that the public safety and human services committee sent in February.,30,,
314,0.97,1935.9,1947.545,We started off as a letter from the committee with oversight of the lead program to the executive.,30,,
315,0.97,1947.545,1955.32,"Because there remains a troubling stalemate, this letter is from the full council.",30,,
316,0.97,1955.32,1965.897,Ifs for more information about Hsd's conversation with a contracting approach that will allow lead to continue funding.,30,,
317,0.97,1965.897,1990.054,"And as background, the Council allocated and the Mayor signed a 2020 budget that included new dollars for lead so that they cannot only right size their case load, they could deal with a backlog, but also expand the program as so many stake holders in our communities have asked for the program to be expanded.",30,,
318,0.97,1990.054,1995.193,Negotiations between Hsd and lead again are reportedly at an impasse.,30,,
319,0.97,1995.193,1998.596,We had received a response from our committee letter.,30,,
320,0.97,1998.596,2005.503,The letter from the public safety and human services committee a couple of weeks ago.,30,,
321,0.97,2005.503,2006.404,I think it was February 27th.,30,,
322,0.97,2006.404,2013.311,"And, it was actually felt like we were moving in the right direction.",30,,
323,0.97,2013.311,2020.818,"And, that letter had proposed releasing funding in a phase one allocation.",30,,
324,0.97,2020.818,2026.858,A phase one contract funding sufficient to both right size their case load.,30,,
325,0.97,2026.858,2028.292,Address the backlog.,30,,
326,0.97,2028.292,2032.663,"But, unfortunately, it would not allow them to take on any new referrals.",30,,
327,0.97,2032.663,2043.074,New referrals is what makes lead such an important program for the committees.,30,,
328,0.97,2043.074,2049.814,Social arrest referrals from SPD and social contact referrals from our business district stake Holiers.,30,,
329,0.97,2049.814,2066.998,"Without the ability for the program to continue to take on those types of emerging public safety issues, lead is not going to be able to function as it is intended to function which is again a public safety program intended to address emerging issues.",30,,
330,0.97,2066.998,2085.917,They cannot deal with their existing case load and a backlog of social contact referrals and not be able to also address the emerging public safety issues that our Communitys are identifying.,30,,
331,0.97,2085.917,2101.132,"So the letter itself proposes another slight modification on the suggestion from the executive in the test, February 27.",30,,
332,0.97,2101.132,2116.781,It asks the executive consider a proposal that does all the things that the earlier memo suggested.,30,,
333,0.97,2116.781,2117.281,Addressed the backlog.,30,,
334,0.97,2117.281,2118.749,Right sized the case load.,30,,
335,0.97,2118.749,2127.391,Sufficient dollars to allow for expansion of lead to address these public safety needs.,30,,
336,0.97,2127.391,2151.716,"I'm hoping that our efforts to both reasonably address what our communities are insisting that we take action in addressing, coupled with a recognition of the executives, reasonable desire to continue negotiations with lead around performance matrix.",30,,
337,0.97,2151.716,2156.387,That this will be received in the spirit of compromise.,30,,
338,0.97,2156.387,2164.395,"And, responsibility for public safety that I think is so again so critical to our communities that we all represent.",30,,
339,0.97,2164.395,2169.6,"So, I will have that at 2:00.",30,,
340,0.97,2169.6,2176.841,And happy to consider any amendments to the letter Y'all received on Sunday.,30,,
