134,0.97,928.494,946.912,"Obviously there is a strong effort by not just Cannabis workers and folks in the industry, but community members who understand the heavy impact that the war on drugs have had on this community, those communities of the black majority and a brown majority.",28,,
135,0.97,946.912,955.888,I think it's important that the Council do what they can to limit these efforts by providing opportunities for worker solidarity in the Cannabis industry.,28,,

153,0.97,1056.422,1076.308,"Lastly, we want to note that it seems like other cities that have also engaged in this equity work with the Cannabis industry spend a considerable amount of time studying the Cannabis market within their city and the broader issue of how Cannabis will look.",32,,

207,0.97,1425.29,1429.728,It is a West Coast day for us.,39,,
208,0.97,1429.728,1430.328,Thanks for joining.,39,,
209,0.97,1430.328,1430.762,Go ahead.,39,,
210,0.97,1430.762,1431.963,Can you hear me okay?,40,,
211,0.97,1431.963,1432.397,Yes.,41,,
212,0.97,1432.397,1432.798,Thank you.,41,,
213,0.97,1432.798,1440.906,I'm happy to be here and happy to share whatever insights that we gathered implementing the Cannabis equity program.,42,,
214,0.97,1440.906,1455.153,"I can share some big picture lessons, if you will . I am available for any questions or details that come up.",42,,
215,0.97,1455.153,1467.532,"I guess some of the things I will share should be seemingly obvious, but I think are kind of understated.",42,,
216,0.97,1467.532,1476.875,"I have the good fortune of doing things the wrong way, if you will, and doing things in a better approach in terms of Legalizing the Cannabis industry.",42,,
217,0.97,1476.875,1497.796,"Just a quick background, I have Overseen the Cannabis industry in Oakland . In 2017, I had the good fortune of collaborating with the former city of Seattle colleague, Darlene Flynn, who was at the time a one person Department of race and equity.",42,,
218,0.97,1497.796,1504.703,We Co-Authored what became the first race and equity analysis and a Cannabis program.,42,,
219,0.97,1504.703,1512.01,"What was key, we actually passed an initial version.",42,,
220,0.97,1512.01,1524.99,"Well, taking a step back to 2015, everyone anticipated recreational Cannabis being legalized in 2016 with a proposition on the ballot.",42,,
221,0.97,1524.99,1534.299,"We looked to copy and paste what had been done in Colorado and Washington, sort of Legalizing the status quo.",42,,
222,0.97,1534.299,1545.744,Former Councilmember Brooks asked who would benefit from the Legalization and that sent us on a whole another trajectory.,42,,
223,0.97,1545.744,1555.086,"Our interim director of race and equity had a quote that I like to steal, which is organizations move in the direction of the questions they ask.",42,,
224,0.97,1555.086,1563.194,"By asking the question, that set us on a completely different direction.",42,,
225,0.97,1563.194,1573.138,"We passed our initial program in 2016, but there was no analysis behind it and as soon as it was passed, there were efforts to repeal it.",42,,
226,0.97,1573.138,1583.315,Our Council was divided . One wanted to double down and one wanted to allow for permanent commencement down the road.,42,,
227,0.97,1583.315,1586.651,Maybe you do something to address the war on drugs.,42,,
228,0.97,1586.651,1597.329,It culminated with Darlene Flynn and I to draft a race and equity analysis.,42,,
229,0.97,1597.329,1601.266,"It seems really simple, but actually having and identifying the goal up front was a game Changer.",42,,
230,0.97,1601.266,1629.06,"Once we got our city Councilmembers to collectively agree on what we offered as a goal, which was to promote business ownership and employment opportunities for those disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs with our Cannabis program, and we laid out relevant data, looking at demographics within the city of Oakland, police data arrests for Cannabis, poverty data, things like that.",42,,
231,0.97,1629.06,1641.506,"We identified the main barriers toward achieving the goal identified, which--and I'm happy to share this analysis and other cities have done it--there will not be major surprises.",42,,
232,0.97,1641.506,1645.01,"Access to capital, technical assistance, things like that.",42,,
233,0.97,1645.01,1657.055,"From there we identified, you know, strategies to overcome and address those different barriers and the program sort of develops from there.",42,,
234,0.97,1657.055,1675.74,"Anyone who wanted to modify that had to clarify how what they proposed would achieve the goal we all agreed upon . In 2016, we had a lot of people jumping to solutions or being lobbied by different interests within the industry.",42,,
235,0.97,1675.74,1683.248,"Once we identify that goal and had that analysis, that really drove our program.",42,,
236,0.97,1683.248,1685.483,That doesn't mean our program was perfect.,42,,
237,0.97,1685.483,1689.754,We are constantly monitoring through Stakeholder engagement.,42,,
238,0.97,1689.754,1696.494,"We had a Cannabis Commission for more than a decade, the city of Oakland.",42,,
239,0.97,1696.494,1710.341,"We have an opportunity to engage the Stakeholders, make adjustments, and we were fortunate that after Oakland created a program, other cities created a program and the state of California has made funding available.",42,,
240,0.97,1710.341,1731.229,"We have been fortunate enough to receive grants in the last couple of years that has allowed us to create a revolving loan program through Cannabis tax revenue, but provide grants, help applicants purchase a property and funded shared manufacturing facilities, workforce development programs, all of which we need to continue to monitor and approve.",42,,
241,0.97,1731.229,1738.336,"In a nutshell, I would encourage you all to do what it sounds like you are all doing and ask critical questions.",42,,
242,0.97,1738.336,1746.778,Try to have a clear goal up front and also take advantage of some of the unique opportunities you have from a government perspective.,42,,
243,0.97,1746.778,1759.023,"You have some permitting authority more so than you might in another context . You have a source of revenue, new source of revenue.",42,,
244,0.97,1759.023,1766.731,"In the case of Washington or California, in this case it's not new but it is a source of revenue in this industry.",42,,
245,0.97,1766.731,1775.94,"I am happy to share our equity analysis from 2017, recent staff reports, and I'll answer follow-up questions.",42,,
246,0.97,1775.94,1779.744,Thank you for the opportunity to share some insights.,42,,
247,0.97,1779.744,1780.945,"Well, thank you very much.",43,,
248,0.97,1780.945,1793.124,I definitely have questions . I would love to know more about the regulatory Commission but I will hold those questions because I asked my colleagues to do that.,43,,
249,0.97,1793.124,1793.958,Please hold your questions.,43,,
250,0.97,1793.958,1795.36,Thank you very much.,43,,
251,0.97,1795.36,1803.101,Next I believe we will hear from Abbey Borchers from the city and county of Denver.,43,,
252,0.97,1803.101,1815.713,"Abbey, I believe you have a presentation . Hi, Abbey . I will let you go ahead and introduce yourself.",43,,
253,0.97,1815.713,1817.115,Thank you for being here with us today.,43,,
254,0.97,1817.115,1820.351,"If you could share your title for the record and your name, that would be great.",43,,
255,0.97,1820.351,1831.93,"My name is Abbey Borchers, policy analyst from Denver's Department of accesses and licenses, which is the Department that issues marijuana business licenses for the city of Denver.",44,,
256,0.97,1831.93,1832.964,I will share my screen.,44,,
257,0.97,1832.964,1840.271,I have a quick presentation to hopefully guide the discussion.,44,,
258,0.97,1840.271,1840.672,Excellent.,45,,
259,0.97,1840.672,1845.143,We have a for the viewing public these presentations linked on today's agenda.,45,,
260,0.97,1845.143,1847.111,Please go ahead.,45,,
261,0.97,1847.111,1857.322,First I just want to quickly set the stage because I know this works differently in different States and in different cities.,46,,
262,0.97,1857.322,1868.099,"The way that works in Colorado, the state licensing authority issues marijuana business licenses as well as individual employee and owner licenses.",46,,
263,0.97,1868.099,1880.945,"They regulate matters of statewide concerns, things like packaging, labeling, testing, et cetera . Denver's Department of licenses issues the correspondent local marijuana business license.",46,,
264,0.97,1880.945,1884.883,We do not issue individual or employee or owner licenses.,46,,
265,0.97,1884.883,1903.434,"We do regulate the time, manner, and place of businesses and other matters of concern, things like public hearing requirements for certain marijuana business types and location requirements, how far they can be from schools and Childcare facilities and things like that.",46,,
266,0.97,1903.434,1918.883,"Just to give you a sense of how many business licenses, marijuana business licenses we have here in Denver, we have 943 active marijuana business licenses . keep in mind we have medical and retail marijuana licenses.",46,,
267,0.97,1918.883,1928.226,The real number of locations is there on the right-hand column.,46,,
268,0.97,1928.226,1946.911,"Looking at around 200 cultivation facilities, 200 stores, 100 manufacturing facilities, and some other license types, like testing facilities, Transporters, research and development facilities, and we have a new marijuana hospitality license, which is a Cannabis consumption lounge type of license.",46,,
269,0.97,1946.911,1958.022,We have one of those currently and three more of those are in the application stages and going through their hearings here shortly.,46,,
270,0.97,1958.022,1970.868,"So, I wanted to address where we have started with approaching equity in the marijuana industry and kind of where we are now.",46,,
271,0.97,1970.868,1981.846,"So, where we started was in 2019, we commissioned a study by a third-party group . It was called analytic in sight.",46,,
272,0.97,1981.846,1997.328,They put together this evaluation of the Cannabis industry and Denver as a whole looking at employment and ownership opportunities and the racial and ethnic makeup of owners and employees in the industry.,46,,
273,0.97,1997.328,2012.11,"What they had found was kind of confirming what we already suspected and what we had already been told, but we wanted to have the data to back it up before we moved any further along.",46,,
274,0.97,2012.11,2026.791,"It showed us that, you know, proportional to the way these groups are represented in Denver, Hispanic and Latino groups are Underrepresented in both ownership and employment in the industry.",46,,
275,0.97,2026.791,2035.5,"Same with lack and African American individuals, Asian, and Indian individuals.",46,,
276,0.97,2035.5,2046.21,"Armed with this data, we felt confident moving forward with a process to come up with a social equity proposal for Denver's Cannabis industry.",46,,
277,0.97,2046.21,2054.552,I can share the full report once I'm done in the chat because there is lots of other data in that report that was very useful.,46,,
278,0.97,2054.552,2062.894,This is just sort of the main data to highlight and share.,46,,
279,0.97,2062.894,2064.662,"Actually, I'll go back.",46,,
280,0.97,2064.662,2091.956,"From there, we took this information that we had and we put together a Workgroup of diverse Stakeholders from just different interest groups . We had industry representatives, public health experts, social equity advocates, prevention of marijuana use advocates who all served on this marijuana licensing group.",46,,
281,0.97,2091.956,2102.7,The purpose was to inform a full overhaul of Denver's marijuana licensing code but also the development of a social equity policy proposal within that overhaul.,46,,
282,0.97,2102.7,2120.685,"And if so we put together that group in 2021. we met virtually throughout 2020. of course, we met with lots of different people just individually One-On- one to get feedback on these proposals.",46,,
283,0.97,2120.685,2133.931,"With the input of that work group, we developed a social equity policy proposal and city council passed that overhaul of the marijuana code as well as the social equity program in 2021.",46,,
284,0.97,2133.931,2139.871,"So, who qualifies as a social equity applicant?",46,,
285,0.97,2139.871,2160.391,"We decided to just adopt the state's definition of an applicant for ease of the applicants not having to go through multiple eligibility processes and adjust for, you know, to respect the work done at the state level to develop this proposal in the Legislature.",46,,
286,0.97,2160.391,2169.6,"So, only Colorado residents can qualify . It doesn't matter how long they have been a Colorado resident.",46,,
287,0.97,2169.6,2171.569,They have to be one at the time of application.,46,,
288,0.97,2171.569,2173.337,They have to meet one of three criteria.,46,,
289,0.97,2173.337,2195.726,"The applicant resided in an opportunity zone or disproportionately impacted area, or at least 15 years between 1980 and 2010, or the applicant or their immediate family member was arrested, convicted, or suffered a significant Forfeiture due to a marijuana fence.",46,,
290,0.97,2195.726,2198.763,"The third criteria, their household income did not exceed 50% of the state median income.",46,,
291,0.97,2198.763,2205.703,They only need to meet one of those three criteria to qualify as an applicant.,46,,
292,0.97,2205.703,2209.774,The applicant has to own at least 51% of the marijuana business license being a printed.,46,,
293,0.97,2209.774,2213.344,A business partner could own the other 49%.,46,,
294,0.97,2213.344,2226.424,"In Denver, I'll talk a little more about this on the next slide, but we decided to exclusively issue most of our licenses to social equity applicant's for the next six years.",46,,
295,0.97,2226.424,2251.182,"Something we were concerned about, and something that was brought to our attention during the legislative process was that somebody could qualify as a social equity applicant, obtain a marijuana license, and turn around and sell it to a Non- social equity applicant . A Nonsocial equity applicant could pay someone to do that.",46,,
296,0.97,2251.182,2264.395,That would really undermine the intent of the program and increase racial and ethnic representation in the industry and give opportunities to people who have previously not had opportunities in this industry.,46,,
297,0.97,2264.395,2275.139,"In Denver, any license granted to a social equity applicant has to continue to be owned 51% or more by a social equity applicant until July 1ST, 2027.",46,,
298,0.97,2275.139,2305.202,"That is the end of the period in which we will be exclusively issuing licenses to social equity applicant's . they can Sublicense to someone else, but the buyer has to be 51% owned by social equity applicants . like I said, most will be issued to social equity applicant's until 2027.",46,,
299,0.97,2305.202,2311.876,That includes Business-To- business transport as well as home delivery of marijuana.,46,,
300,0.97,2311.876,2318.182,"Cultivation facilities, manufacturing facilities and the new business licenses.",46,,
301,0.97,2318.182,2345.643,"That includes the lounge model where people bring their own On- site, and sales Michael model and mobile hospitality, which is the tour buses and Shuttles that people can consume marijuana on . social equity applicants have the ability to do delivery on behalf of stores until July 1ST, 2024.",46,,
302,0.97,2345.643,2365.129,We are offering waived application fees and reduced licensing fees for existing license types and lower than normal application license fees for the new license types which are hospitality businesses and home delivery permits.,46,,
303,0.97,2365.129,2372.036,"And finally, I just wanted to talk about, again, the 2019 study that we did.",46,,
304,0.97,2372.036,2385.449,It is linked there on the slide . It looked at what of the other barriers to ownership because licensing is only one piece of the puzzle.,46,,
305,0.97,2385.449,2388.519,"The other pieces are, you know, what they found as access to start their capital.",46,,
306,0.97,2388.519,2415.913,We are working on just recently our city council approved 1% of marijuana tax revenue to be dedicated to a fund for small business investment . What is unique about that program is marijuana businesses can actually access it . Most of our city grant programs and loan programs can't be accessed by marijuana businesses because they are at least in part federally funded.,46,,
307,0.97,2415.913,2420.251,This fund will be specifically funded by marijuana tax revenue.,46,,
308,0.97,2420.251,2425.856,"While any type of small business could access it, marijuana businesses can too.",46,,
309,0.97,2425.856,2430.494,That fund will be funded up to $50 million.,46,,
310,0.97,2430.494,2438.269,"Other pieces, complexity of regulations . We have been working on education and outreach around that.",46,,
311,0.97,2438.269,2454.919,"The cap on number of available licenses . There used to be a cap on division licenses in Denver and that resulted in, you know, high prices of licenses to be sold.",46,,
312,0.97,2454.919,2458.556,It cost a lot of money to get into the industry because you had to buy a license.,46,,
313,0.97,2458.556,2459.857,We removed that cap.,46,,
314,0.97,2459.857,2469.533,"Just all of these different things like skills required to run a business, difficulty obtaining a location.",46,,
315,0.97,2469.533,2486.35,We are working to put together a technical assistance program through our office of economic development to really provide One-On-One support to advocates and help them overcome these challenges getting into the industry.,46,,
316,0.97,2486.35,2494.525,Really trying to take a multi pronged approach to a complex and difficult program . I think we are feeling optimistic about it.,46,,
317,0.97,2494.525,2514.845,"I don't think anyone has found the magic solution to this issue, but we are seeing a slow but steady progress and it just, you know, takes time to see those licenses get issued without being tied up in lawsuits or anything like that.",46,,
318,0.97,2514.845,2519.917,We are very happy with the progress we are making.,46,,
319,0.97,2519.917,2521.952,Thank you for having us here.,46,,
320,0.97,2521.952,2526.824,I am excited to hear from our other panelists.,46,,
321,0.97,2526.824,2527.858,"Thank you, Abbey.",47,,
322,0.97,2527.858,2542.339,"We will continue with the theme of Denver . stay with our friend, Sarah Woodson, Ceo of at the color of Cannabis in Denver.",47,,
323,0.97,2542.339,2548.579,"Welcome, Sarah Woodson.",47,,
324,0.97,2548.579,2554.051,Thank you for having me.,48,,
325,0.97,2554.051,2555.486,"Abbey, that was a wonderful set up.",48,,
326,0.97,2555.486,2569.3,"I want to talk about reform, redistribution, and restoration . What Abbey just did was talk about all of the work we did through reform . I don't want to spend too much time there but I want to Recap because I've worked on city and state policy.",48,,
327,0.97,2569.3,2578.409,"The color of Cannabis, the organization was founded in 2019 and we have spearheaded the social equity policy.",48,,
328,0.97,2578.409,2602.599,"I've had the honor and opportunity to work closely with Denver along with the state . In 2019, a group of gentlemen that I admire and respect, they created an accelerated program on a state level and essentially what they wanted to do was say existing industry, you have the means, the bandwidth.",48,,
329,0.97,2602.599,2605.869,Let's partner with folks and get them into the Cannabis industry.,48,,
330,0.97,2605.869,2612.743,Their focus was more on small business as opposed to those impacted by the war on drugs.,48,,
331,0.97,2612.743,2615.713,I think that was the start of social equity policy.,48,,
332,0.97,2615.713,2629.593,"During 2019 and 2020, social equity really became more so of something that was rising to the top when you think about concerns and equity in general.",48,,
333,0.97,2629.593,2639.136,"And if so, we were able to run a state bill in 2020 which defined what it would mean to be a social equity applicant.",48,,
334,0.97,2639.136,2640.404,Abbey went over those three things.,48,,
335,0.97,2640.404,2647.478,Essentially where have you lived? have you ever had a Cannabis arrest or conviction?,48,,
336,0.97,2647.478,2652.549,"That could be you, your brother, your sister, your parents, your legal Guardian.",48,,
337,0.97,2652.549,2665.562,"And then income . I want to stop there and just say if you think about those criteria, they are race neutral.",48,,
338,0.97,2665.562,2669.4,"As I go into the restoration piece, I will circle back and touch on that.",48,,
339,0.97,2669.4,2678.575,Avoid any kind of discrimination lawsuit . I don't want to go too big into it . I would love to share this all with you.,48,,
340,0.97,2678.575,2688.919,"When we were implementing local policy in different jurisdictions, we had to essentially talk about why the policy was race neutral because that was a concern.",48,,
341,0.97,2688.919,2701.799,"Race neutral policy, we have these definitions and now we are implementing in Denver . In 2021, we ran a bill to essentially get $4 million in funding on the state level.",48,,
342,0.97,2701.799,2704.501,Now that is the reform piece.,48,,
343,0.97,2704.501,2711.108,"Also when you think about criminal justice reform, there are people running Expungement bills.",48,,
344,0.97,2711.108,2713.243,Give me one second.,48,,
345,0.97,2713.243,2716.68,I am so sorry.,48,,
346,0.97,2716.68,2720.551,The life of zoom.,49,,
347,0.97,2720.551,2724.855,No problem.,49,,
348,0.97,2724.855,2729.359,I appreciate colleagues holding your questions until the end.,49,,
349,0.97,2729.359,2733.831,We are going to have a great chance to hear from colleagues and we will also hear from FAS.,49,,
350,0.97,2733.831,2744.975,We can also hear from FAS and ask questions altogether.,49,,
351,0.97,2744.975,2745.576,All right.,50,,
352,0.97,2745.576,2746.41,I am so sorry.,50,,
353,0.97,2746.41,2747.211,You are good!,51,,
354,0.97,2747.211,2747.811,Thank you.,52,,
355,0.97,2747.811,2748.212,Thank you.,52,,
356,0.97,2748.212,2750.881,"So, now we move on to 2021.",52,,
357,0.97,2750.881,2753.517,We get $4 million.,52,,
358,0.97,2753.517,2755.886,I think that is all about the reform piece.,52,,
359,0.97,2755.886,2763.861,"So now there is this redistribution, which I like to call implementation.",52,,
360,0.97,2763.861,2772.603,Does all the work you are doing on paper translate to helping people and communities that have been negatively impacted by the war on drugs?,52,,
361,0.97,2772.603,2781.712,"What we found is in Colorado, we are doing a great job as you all know as policymakers, policies incremental.",52,,
362,0.97,2781.712,2796.793,"It takes time . You fix something and figure out it doesn't work and you go back and fix it for the social equity applicant, they don't want to hear about that.",52,,
363,0.97,2796.793,2799.363,This is not working.,52,,
364,0.97,2799.363,2805.569,"One, you know, there are a lot of Performative allies in the industry.",52,,
365,0.97,2805.569,2809.039,"When we talk about restoration, there have to be ways to hold people accountable.",52,,
366,0.97,2809.039,2812.409,We have a whole new license type.,52,,
367,0.97,2812.409,2824.555,Abbey just showed you the numbers . There are 207 Dispensaries in Denver and 19 that signed up to participate in delivery.,52,,
368,0.97,2824.555,2838.135,"You have 19 people that have went out and, you know, paid thousands of dollars in licensing and they will be out of business and the dispenser may not allow them to participate.",52,,
369,0.97,2838.135,2863.56,"Then we have the caps removed in Denver, but the issue is for the last 10 years, there have been a lot--excuse me, the issue for the last 10 years, there has been a clear landscape Rollout . I am so sorry, guys.",52,,
370,0.97,2863.56,2875.105,"Once I was talking to someone about Childcare and my Childcare called to say that my daughter had thrown up and I was like, I've got to end this presentation.",53,,
371,0.97,2875.105,2878.842,I have to end this call and go get her.,53,,
372,0.97,2878.842,2880.21,I totally get it.,53,,
373,0.97,2880.21,2885.349,There are no worries here.,53,,
374,0.97,2885.349,2890.42,"Madame clerk, I just want to double check as well as we have a quick pause if Councilmember Edwards got a chance to join us?",53,,
375,0.97,2890.42,2898.095,Feel free to drop in the chat if she is dropped into zoom here.,53,,
376,0.97,2898.095,2904.067,I don't see her in here yet.,54,,
377,0.97,2904.067,2904.434,Okay.,55,,
378,0.97,2904.434,2904.835,No problem.,55,,
379,0.97,2904.835,2917.214,"And a quick reminder, we will have Timeka drew, founder and Ceo of Biko.",55,,
380,0.97,2917.214,2921.918,Then we will conclude with Larissa Wohl and Davina Smith with a Powerpoint presentation.,55,,
381,0.97,2921.918,2924.554,You are free to take a quick Peek at that.,55,,
382,0.97,2924.554,2929.326,And will have members from the Department of finance and administered of services Department.,55,,
383,0.97,2929.326,2943.04,"I will take a quick moment as well . Gerald, the other day we were talking about how do we define equity and what the social equity look like?",55,,
384,0.97,2943.04,2952.582,I think this presentation so far has been so illuminating on what equity means in this sector . did you have any thoughts on that?,55,,
385,0.97,2952.582,2954.418,I kept thinking about that question.,55,,
386,0.97,2954.418,2958.855,I've got a bunch of notes.,56,,
387,0.97,2958.855,2961.725,"Some of my questions have been answered, but I've got a bunch of notes.",56,,
388,0.97,2961.725,2963.16,That's excellent.,57,,
389,0.97,2963.16,2963.894,Great.,57,,
390,0.97,2963.894,2964.161,Great.,57,,
391,0.97,2964.161,2964.761,Great.,57,,
392,0.97,2964.761,2966.797,We will give her one more Úminute.,57,,
393,0.97,2966.797,2968.598,"Good morning, Sarah.",57,,
394,0.97,2968.598,2971.868,"I am so sorry, guys.",58,,
395,0.97,2971.868,2975.739,That's okay.,59,,
396,0.97,2975.739,2981.912,I was mentioning I had to jump off a presentation once because my Childcare called in the middle of it and the presentation was about Childcare.,59,,
397,0.97,2981.912,2982.713,Don't worry.,59,,
398,0.97,2982.713,2988.352,I bought a new little German shepherd puppy.,60,,
399,0.97,2988.352,2990.354,He has been outside and he is running a mock.,60,,
400,0.97,2990.354,2991.788,"The neighbors are like Hey, your dog!",60,,
401,0.97,2991.788,2996.66,I am so sorry.,60,,
402,0.97,2996.66,2998.095,Don't worry about it.,61,,
403,0.97,2998.095,2999.896,Thank you.,62,,
404,0.97,2999.896,3002.966,"I will finish this real strong for you, I promise.",62,,
405,0.97,3002.966,3010.907,"Okay, so now we've got this boots on the ground and things just aren't clicking.",62,,
406,0.97,3010.907,3018.382,"People are not able to find locations because for over 10 years, our market was saturated like yours.",62,,
407,0.97,3018.382,3020.217,"All of the available locations, they are not available.",62,,
408,0.97,3020.217,3020.817,Things aren't working.,62,,
409,0.97,3020.817,3027.524,Where we are now is we have got to go back to that reform.,62,,
410,0.97,3027.524,3040.404,"I think it is a constant cycle with social equity and what I noticed around the country, once you have the first couple of things done and they don't work, everyone is up in roars and they are like, it's not working.",62,,
411,0.97,3040.404,3044.808,It is a small little changes.,62,,
412,0.97,3044.808,3056.586,"Now in Denver and in the state, we need to tighten up our criteria to make sure that people we were seeking to help actually get assistance as opposed to what we see no.",62,,
413,0.97,3056.586,3065.929,You have people with 39 stores qualifying for social equity under the pretense of having an arrest . clearly this program is not for you.,62,,
414,0.97,3065.929,3068.965,You have 39 stores.,62,,
415,0.97,3068.965,3093.757,"Then we need to work with the city council so they can make changes around zoning restrictions . When you are implementing your policies, one of the things I would say is rally think about the landscape off people already out there and figure out, you know, how are new people going to fit into a saturated market?",62,,
416,0.97,3093.757,3107.003,"The other thing through different policy conversations that I have been part of, people are really starting to realize that while race does not need to be the only criteria, some type of minority designation needs to be in there.",62,,
417,0.97,3107.003,3112.442,"Of course, that is going to take a lot of thinking and a lot of smart people to figure out how you avoid lawsuits.",62,,
418,0.97,3112.442,3126.857,"There is no way to acknowledge that black and Brown people were discriminated against and negatively impacted based on the war on drugs . Then we create policy and say well, we can't use race at all.",62,,
419,0.97,3126.857,3130.927,That is one of the things that I think is extremely important.,62,,
420,0.97,3130.927,3135.799,"And finally, the restoration piece is the accountability.",62,,
421,0.97,3135.799,3147.978,"If you guys do delivery and you choose to do delivery the way that we did, which I would say that it's not the best way and we are constantly going to work on changing that . delivery people should be able to deliver their own products.",62,,
422,0.97,3147.978,3159.756,"They should not be at the mercy of the store . So, if you implement delivery where they are delivering their own product, that's one thing.",62,,
423,0.97,3159.756,3164.794,"If they have to use a store, I think it is important to hold stores accountable and also the industry in general.",62,,
424,0.97,3164.794,3172.569,"I understand it is a private sector, but all of these are public programs.",62,,
425,0.97,3172.569,3178.241,"We have to be able to find a way to work together and make sure doesn't only look good on paper, but the actual implementation is a strong.",62,,
426,0.97,3178.241,3183.113,That is pretty much my take overall on it.,62,,
427,0.97,3183.113,3186.983,"Thank you very much, Sarah.",63,,
428,0.97,3186.983,3187.584,"Yes, strong finish.",63,,
429,0.97,3187.584,3189.019,I appreciate your presentation.,63,,
430,0.97,3189.019,3192.622,I'm sure there will be some questions.,63,,
431,0.97,3192.622,3194.691,"Good morning, Tamika.",63,,
432,0.97,3194.691,3203.433,Timeka drew is the founder and Ceo of Biko Los Angeles.,63,,
433,0.97,3203.433,3209.539,"If I am not saying Biko right, please tell us what that stands for and please introduce yourself as you get into your presentation.",63,,
434,0.97,3209.539,3210.14,Thank you.,64,,
435,0.97,3210.14,3212.976,Thank you so much for having me today.,64,,
436,0.97,3212.976,3215.779,Can you hear me okay?,64,,
437,0.97,3215.779,3218.248,Okay.,64,,
438,0.97,3218.248,3218.882,Wonderful.,64,,
439,0.97,3218.882,3220.517,I will actually tell you what Biko means.,64,,
440,0.97,3220.517,3223.753,Biko means please.,64,,
441,0.97,3223.753,3230.727,"I found out that I was Nigerian recently, so I wanted to celebrate that with my brand.",64,,
442,0.97,3230.727,3245.976,"First I would like to thank the members of this city council today in the Seattle community for allowing me to share my experiences as a Cannabis licensee benefiting from the social equity licensing program here in Los Angeles, California.",64,,
443,0.97,3245.976,3253.416,"A little bit about myself, I am currently a manufacturing license holder and a licensee.",64,,
444,0.97,3253.416,3259.723,I am working to Operationalize and I recently applied for a cultivation processing license as well.,64,,
445,0.97,3259.723,3273.903,I am a board member of the Cannabis equity retailers Association and the equity trade certification leadership coalition of policy committee.,64,,
446,0.97,3273.903,3276.773,As well as the social equity owners and workers Association.,64,,
447,0.97,3276.773,3285.115,If you would just hold on one moment.,64,,
448,0.97,3288.251,3289.786,Okay.,65,,
449,0.97,3289.786,3295.859,Let's try that.,65,,
450,0.97,3295.859,3296.66,Can you hear me?,65,,
451,0.97,3296.66,3297.293,"Oh, Yeah.",66,,
452,0.97,3297.293,3298.295,We can hear you well.,66,,
453,0.97,3298.295,3298.695,Wonderful.,67,,
454,0.97,3298.695,3300.797,I was getting feedback on my Headset.,67,,
455,0.97,3300.797,3301.765,I will try again here.,67,,
456,0.97,3301.765,3315.979,I am the mother of four children that I was able to have after becoming a medical Cannabis patient and being able to heal my body from suffering from Crohn's disease for several years.,67,,
457,0.97,3315.979,3323.687,I really plan today to give you a glimpse into my licensing journey as a business owner in Los Angeles.,67,,
458,0.97,3323.687,3325.121,"So, just a little bit about the L.A.",67,,
459,0.97,3325.121,3326.523,Process that is administered by the L.A.,67,,
460,0.97,3326.523,3327.457,Department of Cannabis regulations.,67,,
461,0.97,3327.457,3327.657,L.A.,67,,
462,0.97,3327.657,3333.63,Has gone through three licensing phases.,67,,
463,0.97,3333.63,3335.298,Phase one was previously for licensed medical Dispensaries.,67,,
464,0.97,3335.298,3341.971,"Some of which were Micro- businesses with a combination of operating cultivation manufacturing, distribution, and retail licenses.",67,,
465,0.97,3341.971,3348.478,They were the first ones to get it up and running.,67,,
466,0.97,3348.478,3357.187,"Next was round two, designed for medical operators through social equity qualifications.",67,,
467,0.97,3357.187,3360.056,It is very much in line with the Denver qualifications that were just covered.,67,,
468,0.97,3360.056,3364.327,They had to be able to prove that they ran some kind of previously Compliant business.,67,,
469,0.97,3364.327,3369.799,I was able to obtain a manufacturing license as part of this phase two process.,67,,
470,0.97,3369.799,3374.871,This did require proof of a real estate to apply for that license.,67,,
471,0.97,3374.871,3389.285,Now phase three is the one we are currently in and that was designed for social equity qualified individuals to obtain retail storefront licenses.,67,,
472,0.97,3389.285,3390.854,Those were exclusively for licensees.,67,,
473,0.97,3390.854,3400.53,"Phase three also did require Compliant real estate in order to apply, but after the application came and went, it was really clear the process was marred with several issues.",67,,
474,0.97,3400.53,3412.976,"There was evidence that certain applicants were able to access the application before the portal was open for others, which got in the way of the original first come outcomes.",67,,
475,0.97,3412.976,3437.033,"Further we found that individuals who were submitting their applications from disproportionately impacted areas actually were affected by slower Internet speeds and because of that, they were not able to get in as fast as other people, which affected that first come, first awarded outcomes.",67,,
476,0.97,3437.033,3449.212,In honor of that process and a lawsuit that was brought by the social equity owners and workers Association led to a change in our L.A.,67,,
477,0.97,3449.212,3460.59,Ordinance that expanded the number of licensees through phase three from 100 retail licenses to 200.,67,,
478,0.97,3460.59,3463.493,"Because of this change, I was able to be awarded a retail storefront license.",67,,
479,0.97,3463.493,3474.003,"I was 234 or something like that on the list, so I barely got in.",67,,
480,0.97,3474.003,3479.275,"The problem with this entire process, the whole process was halted for every single person that was part of it as these changes were being made.",67,,
481,0.97,3479.275,3486.616,That made many of these original 100 licensees lose their partners and Compliant property.,67,,
482,0.97,3486.616,3503.466,"So, like most of the second hundred licensees, I lost my initial partner in the real estate I had initially applied with.",67,,
483,0.97,3503.466,3507.203,"Tight rules around where storefront retailers can be located makes it difficult to find Compliant property, even now.",67,,
484,0.97,3507.203,3515.044,Moratoriums on Evictions due to Covid have made it even further difficult.,67,,
485,0.97,3515.044,3533.997,Several real estate owners know their properties are needed for Cannabis licenses within these communities and they either refuse to lease to Cannabis operators or they charge astronomical rents and deposits that make it really impossible to find partners willing to help cover those costs before the businesses become profitable.,67,,
486,0.97,3533.997,3538.434,Now Unfortunately it's not just challenging for the phase three retail licensees.,67,,
487,0.97,3538.434,3549.579,It is challenging for phase two operators were working to get their licenses to work within the city because they don't have enough local retailers to do business with.,67,,
488,0.97,3549.579,3558.288,That is actually pushing their initial plan for profitability black and creating a lack of returns for their investors.,67,,
489,0.97,3558.288,3570.7,"Because of this, I created my own Cannabis brand, Biko.",67,,
490,0.97,3570.7,3575.772,The only way we can continue to survive as a social equity Cannabis brand is to have a statewide sales and distribution.,67,,
491,0.97,3575.772,3578.608,I really had to rely on my city alone to be able to survive.,67,,
492,0.97,3578.608,3586.716,I couldn't within the industry with the way that licensing has happened in the city.,67,,
493,0.97,3586.716,3601.764,One of the more powerful tools that I have found that we have in our community is our people who already know how to run these businesses and can connect to less experienced business owners to help them network and to help share their resources to Supercharge them.,67,,
494,0.97,3601.764,3626.689,"I came in as a grassroots Organizer myself and when I created the nonprofit accelerator, we wanted to harness the power of community and the sharing of resources to get smaller, less experienced social equity operators a chance to not only survive but thrive within this industry.",67,,
495,0.97,3626.689,3636.899,I think challenging businesses and corporations to share their resources and support small social equity businesses is essential.,67,,
496,0.97,3636.899,3646.476,I am wrapping up here.,67,,
497,0.97,3646.476,3647.91,Only a few small things to share.,67,,
498,0.97,3647.91,3676.939,"While considerations like grant money and the suspension of the fees for social license equities has been really important, access to real estate and helping secure that real estate as well as taxes that don't triple our businesses, legal compliance is just as critical to ensure our ongoing success and resource lists and service providers that are Vetted would also be helpful.",67,,
499,0.97,3676.939,3688.918,Actually a loan program in Los Angeles would have been extremely detrimental for us considering the difficulty licensees have had getting their businesses off the ground and could have resulted in losing their licenses altogether.,67,,
500,0.97,3688.918,3699.062,Additionally community reinvestment as we have been talking about it on this call today has not been considered in a real way in L.A.,67,,
501,0.97,3699.062,3708.204,Or California in general and continues to be ignored when it is the driving force behind standing up equity and businesses in general.,67,,
502,0.97,3708.204,3726.656,Last thing I'll talk about is just one major problem we have been going through . partners have been taking advantage of looming deadlines and creating situations where social equity qualified individuals are forced into partnerships in order to not lose their opportunities.,67,,
503,0.97,3726.656,3738.267,Potential partners don't mind if these qualified individuals lose the opportunities for licenses because they feel it may free up retail licenses in the future.,67,,
504,0.97,3738.267,3747.21,"It actually might be in their best interest to make it so no social equity, you know, licensees want to take any deals with partners.",67,,
505,0.97,3747.21,3750.246,Licenses go back into the pot.,67,,
506,0.97,3750.246,3755.151,The Department of Cannabis regulations has requested a series of modifications to the city council through a motion.,67,,
507,0.97,3755.151,3766.329,One of which would allow for relocation anywhere in the city.,67,,
508,0.97,3766.329,3775.071,Those changes probably will not come soon enough for qualified individuals because we have to get our state licenses in next month.,67,,
509,0.97,3775.071,3778.074,It really does put quite a time crunch on what we are trying to do.,67,,
510,0.97,3778.074,3794.524,I have found the Department of Cannabis regulations licensing application workshops to be highly effective in helping licensees learn about the process and also their resources for helping workers learn about how they can build their career and apply for jobs.,67,,
511,0.97,3794.524,3800.029,It's been incredibly helpful and an easy and fair process.,67,,
512,0.97,3800.029,3804.7,Applicants are supported each step of the way.,67,,
513,0.97,3804.7,3811.174,I just really thank you for your time today and I'm always happy to answer any questions or be of service any way I can.,67,,
514,0.97,3811.174,3813.809,You can always reach out to me afterwards.,67,,
515,0.97,3813.809,3815.244,Thank you.,67,,
516,0.97,3815.244,3822.952,Thank you very much . Thank you for sharing your story and the journey and good lessons learned.,68,,
517,0.97,3822.952,3828.09,I think there will be questions for you as well and we will get to that last section here.,68,,
518,0.97,3828.09,3839.635,I'm very excited to have with us the city of Sacramento . Then we'll take some questions and go to our Finance Department to wrap things up.,68,,
519,0.97,3839.635,3847.343,Larissa Wohl and Davina Smith from Sacramento are here with us.,68,,
520,0.97,3847.343,3848.177,Welcome to you both.,68,,
521,0.97,3848.177,3849.178,Thank you for being here.,68,,
522,0.97,3849.178,3856.018,I know there was ace a schedule conflict from Councilmember Edwards from Boston.,68,,
523,0.97,3856.018,3859.956,"Larissa and Divina, thank you.",68,,
524,0.97,3859.956,3863.726,These introduce yourself.,68,,
525,0.97,3863.726,3867.263,Thank you very much.,69,,
526,0.97,3867.263,3871.1,We are happy to be here and appreciate the invitation.,69,,
527,0.97,3871.1,3881.944,It's important for us to be here and we appreciate the opportunity you have awarded for us to come together.,69,,
528,0.97,3881.944,3886.816,My name is Davina Smith and I am the Cannabis manager for the city of Sacramento.,69,,
529,0.97,3886.816,3895.424,My background is as an attorney advising Cannabis enforcement and Land-Use.,69,,
530,0.97,3895.424,3901.23,I joined the city of Sacramento right before the pandemic in 2020.,69,,
531,0.97,3901.23,3904.867,It has been an interesting last two years.,69,,
532,0.97,3904.867,3912.575,"My colleague, Larissa Wohl, is with me.",69,,
533,0.97,3912.575,3918.681,"I am a Larissa Wohl, an administrative analyst in the office of Cannabis management and the liaison to the court of social equity.",70,,
534,0.97,3918.681,3919.282,Thank you.,71,,
535,0.97,3919.282,3921.317,We will go ahead and move forward with our Powerpoint.,71,,
536,0.97,3921.317,3925.154,We each will be sharing some of the duties here.,71,,
537,0.97,3925.154,3931.661,You will get to hear from both of us.,71,,
538,0.97,3931.661,3934.497,"As far as where the money comes from, we do have a city tax.",71,,
539,0.97,3934.497,3936.766,It is 4% on Cannabis businesses.,71,,
540,0.97,3936.766,3939.735,We don't differentiate between businesses at this time.,71,,
541,0.97,3939.735,3946.909,That revenue is not earmarked for any purpose.,71,,
542,0.97,3946.909,3948.144,It goes into our general fund.,71,,
543,0.97,3948.144,3952.782,"This has been in place for, gosh, maybe three years now?",71,,
544,0.97,3952.782,3962.958,"One of the things we know about Cannabis, we are always pivoting and things change quickly and often.",71,,
545,0.97,3962.958,3964.493,We need to be prepared for that.,71,,
546,0.97,3964.493,3969.365,"As far as permit fees, we collect those from Nonequity businesses.",71,,
547,0.97,3969.365,3972.868,We do not charge operating permit fees.,71,,
548,0.97,3972.868,3988.351,"With permit fees that we take in, we are able to fund the office of Cannabis management as well as our partners who work on those permits and the police Department, things like that.",71,,
549,0.97,3988.351,3997.693,"We do collect those fees when a business permit is submitted, not when it is issued.",71,,
550,0.97,3997.693,4003.799,It is important for our equity program . We do not currently have a funding source.,71,,
551,0.97,4003.799,4006.369,We had a two year funding source.,71,,
552,0.97,4006.369,4010.272,Unfortunately it was in the midst of the pandemic.,71,,
553,0.97,4010.272,4014.343,All funding was pretty much frozen at that point.,71,,
554,0.97,4014.343,4018.681,We are working on getting that permanent long-term funding source.,71,,
555,0.97,4018.681,4021.25,"Next slide, please?",71,,
556,0.97,4021.25,4026.789,"So, our equity program, the C.O.R.E.",71,,
557,0.97,4026.789,4027.757,Program came around in 2017.,71,,
558,0.97,4027.757,4032.228,"At that point, the city council corrected staff to start working on this.",71,,
559,0.97,4032.228,4064.794,"Our equity study is based on the city of Sacramento and looking at the city of Sacramento where census data, arrest data, and we took that broader data and worked with community members . with the community brought to the table is the idea that is not just the person getting arrested impacted.",71,,
560,0.97,4064.794,4095.991,"It is the entire family, the entire community, as the children may have to go to other family members to be raised and the lack of a father, sometimes a mother, an Uncle, aunt, you know, grandparents and the impact that people living in the impacted community can see people disappear because they are in jail or Julie.",71,,
561,0.97,4095.991,4103.532,We realized we could adjust focus on the common individual.,71,,
562,0.97,4103.532,4117.947,We widened our criteria to include family members of those that had been arrested and living in impacted areas . This really does look at the full impact of the war on drugs.,71,,
563,0.97,4117.947,4126.689,We did adopt our equity resolution for the program and we have been using it ever since.,71,,
564,0.97,4126.689,4148.477,"They do receive Cannabis development resources, small business training, education, financial and technical assistance . We are at an interesting point as we move forward.",71,,
565,0.97,4148.477,4149.211,That is for sure.,71,,
566,0.97,4149.211,4165.161,"As far as our numbers, we have 300 people that have become eligible for membership and, you know, one of our Metrics we are always looking at, we have 300 people eligible but we only have 24 operating Cannabis businesses.",71,,
567,0.97,4165.161,4182.945,"Unlike some of our colleagues, we don't allow people to operate prior to getting a full Buildout, full sign off by PD.",71,,
568,0.97,4184.647,4186.415,All of these things have to be in place.,71,,
569,0.97,4186.415,4190.452,All of the health safety things have to be addressed before we will allow a business to operate in Sacramento.,71,,
570,0.97,4190.452,4193.088,"For a lot of our applicants, you know, it is a tough road.",71,,
571,0.97,4193.088,4205.901,"One of the things we are working on, the financial assistance that can really help people get through the committee and emerge on the other side.",71,,
572,0.97,4205.901,4211.373,"When we say the cultivation, that is six permits that have been issued to C.O.R.E.",71,,
573,0.97,4211.373,4218.113,Members out of 93 Non-Equity permits that have been issued.,71,,
574,0.97,4218.113,4220.916,We have four pending applications.,71,,
575,0.97,4220.916,4230.526,"As you can see, one of the things that Sacramento did, and if you were to go back in time, we probably change this metric.",71,,
576,0.97,4230.526,4233.095,We let it be open.,71,,
577,0.97,4233.095,4246.108,"We said if you want to come in and operate a Cannabis business here, as long as you get your permit so your environmental impacts are dealt with, you will get your building permits and business operating permit.",71,,
578,0.97,4246.108,4250.379,You can operate here.,71,,
579,0.97,4250.379,4252.948,We didn't hold any permit apart for our equity members.,71,,
580,0.97,4252.948,4259.788,We just sort of let that move forward.,71,,
581,0.97,4259.788,4262.758,"Looking back, that is definitely something we could do differently.",71,,
582,0.97,4262.758,4272.735,"I will say in the two years I've been here, the number of business offerings have caught up significantly but it is a road and we acknowledge that.",71,,
583,0.97,4272.735,4275.404,"Can we go on to the next slide, please?",71,,
584,0.97,4275.404,4279.208,"Thank you, Davina.",72,,
585,0.97,4279.208,4291.854,I wanted to give you an oversight and an overview of some of the things offered to you once they become verified.,72,,
586,0.97,4291.854,4297.092,"For grant funding, all of the grant funding at this moment comes from state funding.",72,,
587,0.97,4297.092,4320.249,"Every year they have an equity grant application . In 2020, we had $1.2 million in state funding for fiscal year 19 that we dispersed as a $25,000 reimbursement grant for permit application . that was before I came on board and I believe they were finishing that up before moving onto the next year of funding when I came on board.",72,,
588,0.97,4320.249,4345.841,"This year for the 21 funding, we received $1.6 million and this was really a process that came on in July of last year at the beginning of this we developed a series . We heard from Stakeholder communities and some of the Stakeholder organizations that they wanted to be involved in the process.",72,,
589,0.97,4345.841,4351.113,We did a series.,72,,
590,0.97,4351.113,4352.481,We met monthly with our Stakeholders.,72,,
591,0.97,4352.481,4361.557,"We did a series of surveys to Hone in on what they were looking for . understanding we can't appease everybody, we did it democratically.",72,,
592,0.97,4361.557,4368.397,"At the end of the day, what the community decided on was a first come first serve process.",72,,
593,0.97,4368.397,4381.41,"Grants up to $125,000 for those with leased or owned locations, which at the end of the day, we double checked with folks because we knew that was a lot of money.",72,,
594,0.97,4381.41,4395.624,"We explained that would only really amount to a small number of recipients . at the end of the day, that is what most of the folks wanted and we took the feedback after the process.",72,,
595,0.97,4395.624,4397.86,"It was a little bit of a struggle, to be honest.",72,,
596,0.97,4397.86,4402.798,"You know, some of the--a lot of folks had issues with the application process.",72,,
597,0.97,4402.798,4408.604,"Again, I think there is a first come, first serve.",72,,
598,0.97,4408.604,4410.172,There will be issues there.,72,,
599,0.97,4410.172,4417.346,We took things we learned through the process and developed the program moving forward for the next grand year.,72,,
600,0.97,4417.346,4426.722,"For the next fiscal year 2022, we received $4.35 million in state funding, which is significantly more.",72,,
601,0.97,4426.722,4433.395,We are looking at a combination of small and large brands and really trying to maximize the impact across the board.,72,,
602,0.97,4433.395,4436.198,We are looking at setting aside a significant amount of that.,72,,
603,0.97,4436.198,4450.479,We know that there are potential business owners who are looking to build out larger projects that might help support what we will build through the system.,72,,
604,0.97,4450.479,4456.552,Potentially shared use facilities and things like that.,72,,
605,0.97,4456.552,4461.023,We are currently developing the project.,72,,
606,0.97,4461.023,4468.53,The grant program will come out in the following months.,72,,
607,0.97,4468.53,4500.629,"In 2021, we received $3.7 million in state grant funding which allowed us to establish zero interest loan program and initially we had been dispersing $25,000 and $50,000 grants . We wanted to make sure even if people had a secure location, they could use loan finding to help them do that as they went to business owners, they could show them they had funding to be able to put a down payment on the location.",72,,
608,0.97,4500.629,4505.501,"The goal was once all of those funds were disbursed, it would move into a revolving loan Fund.",72,,
609,0.97,4505.501,4506.502,It now has.,72,,
610,0.97,4506.502,4508.003,We have dispersed all of that funding.,72,,
611,0.97,4508.003,4515.043,"I know there were some other panelists who mentioned issues with loan funds, which I think are very real.",72,,
612,0.97,4515.043,4533.529,"We initially thought there would be a delayed payment plan and there isn't . We know for some people, loans are better than for others but we know it has helped a lot of businesses in opening and maintaining their business.",72,,
613,0.97,4533.529,4540.569,We also offer educational opportunities and direct technical support through third- party Facilitators.,72,,
614,0.97,4540.569,4557.586,"For the first two years of the social equity program, we contracted with two local organizations and received two bids from the Chamber of Commerce . at the time, we were operating two different programs.",72,,
615,0.97,4557.586,4566.194,Those Facilitators provided the verification of eligibility for the C.O.R.E.,72,,
616,0.97,4566.194,4575.971,"Programs . direct technical assistance prior to Covid, they did have in person classes but all of those have Transitioned to Online.",72,,
617,0.97,4575.971,4593.655,"Like I said, One-On-One support and Mentorship and access to industry for professionals . not always free, but contracted at a lower rate.",72,,
618,0.97,4593.655,4597.793,We had heard from many Accor members that their needs are not being met by this current offering.,72,,
619,0.97,4597.793,4605.834,I will talk a little bit about potentially what is next and things we are looking to change.,72,,
620,0.97,4605.834,4610.372,"First, in things we are currently working on, we have a C.O.R.E.",72,,
621,0.97,4610.372,4620.248,Media and Committee outreach campaign . We just signed that contract with a local firm . We are excited to be moving forward with them.,72,,
622,0.97,4620.248,4622.117,The goal is to highlight our C.O.R.E.,72,,
623,0.97,4622.117,4626.154,Program in a number of ways.,72,,
624,0.97,4626.154,4635.297,"Giving consumers the knowledge they need . If they are starting to ask for local equity brands, most retailers don't have it.",72,,
625,0.97,4635.297,4651.813,"You know, just like there are Stickers in windows or ways to identify black owned or women owned businesses, that is what we are looking to do and also to raise the awareness of the C.O.R.E.",72,,
626,0.97,4651.813,4664.559,Program as well as highlighting the stories and sharing the stories widely of business owners because we know Storytelling is very Impactful.,72,,
627,0.97,4664.559,4670.465,It can make a major difference in the industry.,72,,
628,0.97,4670.465,4675.237,We are recognizing and hearing the feedback from C.O.R.E.,72,,
629,0.97,4675.237,4679.174,Members of what they're currently being offered.,72,,
630,0.97,4679.174,4682.044,It's not enough to support them in opening a business.,72,,
631,0.97,4682.044,4689.518,We are currently developing that scope.,72,,
632,0.97,4689.518,4691.787,You can see some of the services we are looking into.,72,,
633,0.97,4691.787,4695.957,It includes options beyond what we had already established.,72,,
634,0.97,4695.957,4709.304,"Last year, we launched a Cannabis industrywide study with the economic and planning services, who I know has done a lot of work with the city before.",72,,
635,0.97,4709.304,4714.342,This was requested by the city Council to visit the impact of the Cannabis industry citywide.,72,,
636,0.97,4714.342,4721.016,"They were interested in Land-Use, taxes, economic and fiscal impact.",72,,
637,0.97,4721.016,4732.794,There are a few policies that are expiring soon that they wanted to have hard data to be able to inform policy decisions.,72,,
638,0.97,4732.794,4736.064,We are hoping that will be publicly made available next week.,72,,
639,0.97,4736.064,4740.102,We have been waiting for a little while.,72,,
640,0.97,4740.102,4765.093,"When that is publicly released, there will be a series of workshops hopefully informing policy to bring to city council . I would add for the next item, we knew going into this that the industrywide study was really going to be an overview and go into a deeper dive in some areas but not others.",72,,
641,0.97,4765.093,4771.8,We knew at the Onset that we would want to do a deeper dive and equity is one of those areas.,72,,
642,0.97,4771.8,4785.614,We recently launched and are accepting bids for the study to dive deeper into the Cannabis industry in Sacramento.,72,,
643,0.97,4785.614,4787.849,It sounds similar to the things Denver has learned already.,72,,
644,0.97,4787.849,4794.156,We are looking at better understanding looking back at the first couple of years of the program.,72,,
645,0.97,4794.156,4813.642,We are learning good Takeaways and mitigating additional barriers and resources and we want to make sure it is informing public policy and industrywide study.,72,,
646,0.97,4813.642,4817.279,It's impacted by social equity and racial equity.,72,,
647,0.97,4817.279,4824.019,We are excited for that.,72,,
648,0.97,4824.019,4826.655,It will give us really important information as we move forward.,72,,
649,0.97,4826.655,4840.268,"I might ask you to conclude with the last slide and we can integrate some of the challenges into the questions, so we can get to some of the questions, if that's okay.",73,,
650,0.97,4840.268,4868.496,"We are working on workforce development because we understand that supporting the Cannabis industry is from all sides, both supporting business owners in getting their businesses open and making sure they are taking advantage of the opportunities of all of the jobs that are being created, which in Sacramento, is allowing those with different skill SETS to participate.",74,,
651,0.97,4868.496,4879.04,Thank you for your time . I think that will tee up some of the questions that I did have for the panelists here today.,75,,
652,0.97,4879.04,4882.544,"But first, can you please join me in thanking the esteemed panelists for being with us today?",75,,
653,0.97,4882.544,4900.729,"I want to thank Aretha from my office who will work to get outreach from different jurisdictions . Thank you, Aretha . colleagues, I am happy to open it up to here some questions.",75,,
654,0.97,4900.729,4915.21,"Chair Herbold, vice chair Herbold, long time champion on equity issues especially in trying to rectify some of the harms of the war on drugs but also chair of public safety and human services.",75,,
655,0.97,4915.21,4918.48,"Please go ahead, Councilmember.",75,,
656,0.97,4918.48,4929.491,I wanted to express my appreciation for the incredible groundbreaking work across the country.,76,,
657,0.97,4929.491,4970.565,"Thank you for taking time out from your busy days to share your lessons learned for us I wanted to share a comment from a person of color Cannabis business . someone watching this presentation right now excited about all of this work you wanted to thank everybody for their continued support through social changes globally, nationally, and really wants to remind us all how important, as we heard from Lynn Domingo in public comment today, how important the socialization we have seen in Cannabis is so important.",76,,
658,0.97,4970.565,4973.702,We really must have a Federal reform as well.,76,,
659,0.97,4973.702,4980.141,Just a reminder that hopefully we are all looking at that Federal reform as well.,76,,
660,0.97,4980.141,4987.482,Businesses can do business like any other accepted business in our community.,76,,
661,0.97,4987.482,5012.04,"In doing so, we can have a safer workplace and also by being able to do business that way, it reduces some barriers that folks have entering into this industry . big support for the equity efforts that we are all working on here.",76,,
662,0.97,5012.04,5049.344,"My question is kind of a sequencing question . In 2020 and 2021, with support of the Council, I worked with the office of Inter-Mental government relations to add support for legislation on the state level to address the lack of equity in Cannabis licenses and there was a law passed in 2020 and 2021 which expanded the eligibility for licenses and created a state grant program.",76,,
663,0.97,5049.344,5055.15,It is 1.1 million . We recognize it's not sufficient.,76,,
664,0.97,5055.15,5063.792,"It's not the number of funds for the entire state per year, but just focusing on the issue of social equity licenses themselves.",76,,
665,0.97,5063.792,5082.777,We know Seattle will receive two social equity licenses from the state and King County equity and a Cannabis project have demanded the city ask for 30 social equity licenses.,76,,
666,0.97,5082.777,5094.823,"Currently there are 38 available statewide and FAS has reported even to use the two equity licenses that we have available to us, zoning is a barrier.",76,,
667,0.97,5094.823,5116.311,"Stakeholders have asked us to expand Seattle's Land-Use to allow for a retail licenses . I am really interested to learn from the other jurisdictions whether or not their zoning and land use restrictions make it difficult to use their social equity licenses . If so, do you recommend--how do you recommend sequencing the necessary change?",76,,
668,0.97,5116.311,5122.817,Do you work on increasing the number of licenses first and expand the zoning?,76,,
669,0.97,5122.817,5124.853,Do you recommend we do it the other way around?,76,,
670,0.97,5124.853,5130.325,Change the zoning and advocate for more licenses?,76,,
671,0.97,5130.325,5130.725,Thank you.,76,,
672,0.97,5130.725,5131.326,Great question.,77,,
673,0.97,5131.326,5134.996,I see two hands in response so far.,77,,
674,0.97,5134.996,5136.364,"Please go ahead, Greg.",77,,
675,0.97,5136.364,5138.633,Then Davina next.,77,,
676,0.97,5138.633,5150.011,"Thank you to all of the panelists . Some folks, like Davina, unfortunately have to deal with listening to me talk.",78,,
677,0.97,5150.011,5152.447,It was interesting to hear from other jurisdictions.,78,,
678,0.97,5152.447,5165.693,I will just share how we approached it here . It sounds like there is a limit on the number of licenses . that might be defined by state law or local law.,78,,
679,0.97,5165.693,5186.781,"We have flexibility in California . at the local level, in Oakland, we have taken the approach of having no Numeric limit on the number of licenses other than for brick and mortar retail . I kind of see the pros and cons of both approaches.",78,,
680,0.97,5186.781,5189.284,Not having a limit on the number allows for a fluid process.,78,,
681,0.97,5189.284,5194.722,People can apply at any time.,78,,
682,0.97,5194.722,5197.859,"If there is some sort of defect in the application, no big deal.",78,,
683,0.97,5197.859,5205.934,"It kind of LOWERS barriers . You know, opportunities for everyone.",78,,
684,0.97,5205.934,5210.338,Some people say it is a race to the bottom because you have competition from the whole world.,78,,
685,0.97,5210.338,5217.245,"On the retail side where we have a limit, we see the pros and cons of that approach.",78,,
686,0.97,5217.245,5224.352,You have to have a set process and application window.,78,,
687,0.97,5224.352,5227.021,"If somebody doesn't do well or misses a deadline, you can't cure it.",78,,
688,0.97,5227.021,5228.456,You cannot redo the race.,78,,
689,0.97,5228.456,5236.564,However having a limit on the number can create more of a demand.,78,,
690,0.97,5236.564,5243.605,"People with capital might be more Incentivized to partner with an equity business for the purpose of opening a more limited, more exclusive business type.",78,,
691,0.97,5243.605,5269.664,"With respect to real estate, through the retail process, we select the applicant . We have had a process where equity applicants are selected through a lottery . The other half is competitive and favors those that promote equity . Then they have a window of time to find real estate.",78,,
692,0.97,5269.664,5278.006,"They don't have to secure real estate or pay rent on the off chance they are selected and from month to month, wait for that all to play out.",78,,
693,0.97,5278.006,5284.078,It sounds like jurisdictions need a place to do business.,78,,
694,0.97,5284.078,5294.255,Requiring real estate Upfront can lead to really unfortunate outcomes and it creates a barrier.,78,,
695,0.97,5294.255,5306.234,"I don't know if that was helpful at all, but I wanted to share some of how we approach the limit or not having a limit on licenses and real estate.",78,,
696,0.97,5306.234,5306.834,Very helpful.,79,,
697,0.97,5306.834,5310.071,Davina and then Sarah in response to the question.,79,,
698,0.97,5310.071,5311.105,Thank you.,80,,
699,0.97,5311.105,5320.448,"In Sacramento, you know, we have a Fear-Based zoning that came about in 2018.",80,,
700,0.97,5320.448,5325.72,It is the idea that Cannabis businesses would be very Impactful in the surrounding community.,80,,
701,0.97,5325.72,5346.441,"Most of our Cannabis businesses were zoned in manufacturing and industrial areas . They have to be a certain distance . What we found actually is that over the last several years, impacts did not necessarily occur.",80,,
702,0.97,5346.441,5352.547,"Businesses, because they are so highly regulated, they are the cleanest one on the block.",80,,
703,0.97,5352.547,5353.748,They pick up their trash.,80,,
704,0.97,5353.748,5359.854,They tried to be good to their neighbors.,80,,
705,0.97,5359.854,5372.433,"In the areas surrounding these Cannabis businesses, which is pretty interesting, I think that having available space for businesses to go, especially equity businesses is important.",80,,
706,0.97,5372.433,5375.703,"We found a 2018, there was a rush.",80,,
707,0.97,5375.703,5396.224,"All of a sudden the price for square foot for commercial real estate go up pretty high . that impacted not only the ability of equity businesses to afford to go there and to be able to go there, but also not Cannabis businesses that may have wanted that warehouse space or industrial space.",80,,
708,0.97,5396.224,5422.817,"All of a sudden you have a vacant space . someone can afford to pay three to seven dollars more per square foot . I think having a variety of places where people can actually go in, that will prevent the operator from being squeezed like that.",80,,
709,0.97,5422.817,5427.488,This landlord is charging a crazy amount.,80,,
710,0.97,5427.488,5433.795,I think that is really important for them to have.,80,,
711,0.97,5433.795,5434.395,Sums up.,81,,
712,0.97,5434.395,5434.996,"Thank you, Davina.",81,,
713,0.97,5434.996,5438.266,"Sarah, please go ahead.",81,,
714,0.97,5438.266,5440.902,Thank you.,82,,
715,0.97,5440.902,5443.871,"And don't worry, I won't stop this time.",82,,
716,0.97,5443.871,5455.049,"Yes, zoning is extremely critical and I believe that they can be done at the same time because the process does take a while.",82,,
717,0.97,5455.049,5462.023,"In Denver, we have this really great program.",82,,
718,0.97,5462.023,5469.73,I do think there is good public policy when it comes to that.,82,,
719,0.97,5469.73,5474.135,You don't want to have a lot of over concentration or overcrowding.,82,,
720,0.97,5474.135,5475.57,We essentially already have that.,82,,
721,0.97,5475.57,5492.487,"The thousands from store to store, neighborhoods that are predominantly black and Brown, you can no longer open cultivation stores there.",82,,
722,0.97,5492.487,5499.594,Those things are stopping our social equity people from being able to progress . It is extremely discouraging.,82,,
723,0.97,5499.594,5507.134,"When you guys implement your policy, the one thing I will say, the old rules cannot apply.",82,,
724,0.97,5507.134,5508.769,I like what we have done in Denver.,82,,
725,0.97,5508.769,5518.846,We have this exclusivity period . We are giving it time to see how it cultivates and grows.,82,,
726,0.97,5518.846,5526.02,The zoning is extremely important.,82,,
727,0.97,5526.02,5528.89,The social equity person can apply but there are no open stores.,82,,
728,0.97,5528.89,5540.835,Now they are losing all of the momentum they have been gaining and trying to build up for this period of time coming into the application process.,82,,
729,0.97,5540.835,5546.307,"Yes, zoning is important and I would recommend doing it simultaneously with the licenses.",82,,
730,0.97,5546.307,5550.578,Very helpful.,83,,
731,0.97,5550.578,5551.178,Thank you all.,83,,
732,0.97,5551.178,5554.482,"One of the questions I have related to the Finance chair, social equity funds.",83,,
733,0.97,5554.482,5556.918,Some have mentioned the 4% tax.,83,,
734,0.97,5556.918,5571.132,"I thought that I heard--it might have been in Denver--I thought I heard a $50 million a year for an equity Fund, but I could have heard that wrong.",83,,
735,0.97,5571.132,5582.276,"I want to make sure I understand more . If there is a fund being created, could you remind us what the total amount is that comes in each year?",83,,
736,0.97,5582.276,5586.547,You mentioned the multi Prong approach.,83,,
737,0.97,5586.547,5598.526,"To make sure there is a siding and support, supporting workers in the industry as well as the creation of--what we call it in Oakland?",83,,
738,0.97,5598.526,5599.16,The Cannabis Commission.,83,,
739,0.97,5599.16,5613.541,"I was wondering if you would know the numbers offhand if the jurisdictions might be able to comment on if you have an equity Fund, how much comes in each year and I'm looking forward to hearing more on how many in addition to the state funds.",83,,
740,0.97,5613.541,5622.283,I can see Abbey and Sarah have their hands up.,83,,
741,0.97,5622.283,5626.754,"Please go ahead, Abbey.",83,,
742,0.97,5626.754,5627.555,Thanks for popping in.,83,,
743,0.97,5627.555,5627.989,Sure.,84,,
744,0.97,5627.989,5631.158,Thanks for the question.,84,,
745,0.97,5631.158,5644.839,"In 2021, Denver city council decided to allocate 1% of existing marijuana tax revenue to a small business investment fund.",84,,
746,0.97,5644.839,5646.807,It is an additional tax on marijuana.,84,,
747,0.97,5646.807,5649.844,It is reallocated 1% of our current revenue.,84,,
748,0.97,5649.844,5666.327,"That fund can be funded up to $50 million but the projection for 2022--I would have to double check and let you know what the exact number is, but I think it's around $4 million.",84,,
749,0.97,5666.327,5674.035,"That fund can be accessed by all sorts of different small businesses, but also by Cannabis businesses.",84,,
750,0.97,5674.035,5689.116,"$500,000 of marijuana tax revenue is being used to fund our technical assistance program that we are in the process of reviewing proposals for as we speak.",84,,
751,0.97,5689.116,5690.885,Thank you so very much.,85,,
752,0.97,5690.885,5697.658,Anybody else with comments on the equity fund at their jurisdiction will be pulling from?,85,,
753,0.97,5697.658,5700.428,"Go ahead, Sarah.",85,,
754,0.97,5700.428,5716.343,"In Colorado on the state level, we have a $4 million Fund . It is the Cannabis business office . that came from marijuana tax cash fund.",86,,
755,0.97,5716.343,5717.845,Right now it is a pilot program.,86,,
756,0.97,5717.845,5724.385,"If it is successful, we will be able to go back to our joint budget committee and ask for additional funds.",86,,
757,0.97,5724.385,5738.466,"Basically there is a $25,000 plan and a $50,000 grant . There are different qualifications and you have to be actively seeking a social equity license.",86,,
758,0.97,5738.466,5740.668,It is a competitive process.,86,,
759,0.97,5740.668,5744.171,There is a scoring rubric.,86,,
760,0.97,5744.171,5748.242,I can share that with you guys off-line if you're interested in seeing that.,86,,
761,0.97,5748.242,5752.88,Those are the two categories that it falls into.,86,,
762,0.97,5752.88,5763.858,"We are anticipating 100 people applying but because it's competitive, I don't know how many of those people will actually be awarded funds.",86,,
763,0.97,5763.858,5764.258,Wonderful.,87,,
764,0.97,5764.258,5770.164,"Yes, I would love that information.",87,,
765,0.97,5770.164,5773.067,"For any of the panelists as well, please feel free to send us information.",87,,
766,0.97,5773.067,5784.645,"I will ask one more concluding comment and then we will get to the Finance and administrative services presentation, which will go into more of the analysis and conversations happening locally and here in Seattle.",87,,
767,0.97,5784.645,5786.814,I want to make sure we hear from Gerald.,87,,
768,0.97,5786.814,5789.45,"Gerald, did you have a question to ask for the panelists?",87,,
769,0.97,5789.45,5794.355,"Oh, you are on mute . So sorry, Gerald.",87,,
770,0.97,5794.355,5797.992,I do that all the time.,88,,
771,0.97,5797.992,5798.893,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",88,,
772,0.97,5798.893,5811.172,"First of all, I want to say that you are all very informed and it helped me understand this.",88,,
773,0.97,5811.172,5814.241,I've got a couple of questions and one in particular when talking about social equity.,88,,
774,0.97,5814.241,5816.076,I heard about social equity a few years ago.,88,,
775,0.97,5816.076,5824.819,"It refers to justice with a social equity policy for race, gender, and sexuality.",88,,
776,0.97,5824.819,5826.02,That is what the definition is.,88,,
777,0.97,5826.02,5827.855,That is according to Wikipedia.,88,,
778,0.97,5827.855,5833.127,Some in the community say this is not all targeted by the war on drugs.,88,,
779,0.97,5833.127,5846.941,My question is how do you tell communities impacted by the war on drugs that it includes others that are not targeted by the war on drugs?,88,,
780,0.97,5846.941,5848.976,I see Greg with his hand up.,89,,
781,0.97,5848.976,5852.012,"Please go ahead, Greg.",89,,
782,0.97,5852.012,5864.825,"To me, it depends on your goal . If you have a clear goal, you can design a program that all Aligns and builds toward that.",90,,
783,0.97,5864.825,5868.662,You have an opportunity to define what your goal is.,90,,
784,0.97,5868.662,5880.875,"I think it sounds like from some of the speakers, every jurisdiction has chosen different approaches . that is what I would encourage first and foremost.",90,,
785,0.97,5880.875,5882.676,It sounds really obvious and simple.,90,,
786,0.97,5882.676,5884.511,It's not necessarily simple.,90,,
787,0.97,5884.511,5889.383,It's not easy to do.,90,,
788,0.97,5889.383,5894.054,I think defining a goal is critical to ensure that you actually have the outcomes that you are seeking.,90,,
789,0.97,5894.054,5896.724,That is kind of what comes to my mind.,90,,
790,0.97,5896.724,5907.067,I see Sarah and Davina.,91,,
791,0.97,5907.067,5911.939,"Gerald, for us, it was about who has been negatively impacted by the war on drugs.",92,,
792,0.97,5911.939,5918.045,There was a lot of contention around it because there were people who wanted Canada Moms in the definition.,92,,
793,0.97,5918.045,5920.414,People wanted veterans in the definition.,92,,
794,0.97,5920.414,5923.517,There were all of these different things.,92,,
795,0.97,5923.517,5931.225,"We started saying Okay, what does it mean to be negatively impacted by the war on drugs?",92,,
796,0.97,5931.225,5932.86,"Well, how long did the war on drugs last?",92,,
797,0.97,5932.86,5934.295,It's still going on right now.,92,,
798,0.97,5934.295,5937.731,Can we come up with one Timeline?,92,,
799,0.97,5937.731,5945.873,We came up with 2019 to 2010.,92,,
800,0.97,5945.873,5948.709,What would be the variables to determine if a community was negatively impacted?,92,,
801,0.97,5948.709,5959.253,"High levels of marijuana arrests, heightened crime, low high school rates for completion.",92,,
802,0.97,5959.253,5974.301,"We also looked at public housing, school lunches, basically places where people are living in poverty essentially . and of course, where black and Brown and neighborhoods consist of.",92,,
803,0.97,5974.301,5980.007,That was the first thing and everyone was in agreement on that.,92,,
804,0.97,5980.007,5982.209,The hardest part is the income.,92,,
805,0.97,5982.209,5993.587,People can make their income what they want it to be and not really be negatively impacted.,92,,
806,0.97,5993.587,5997.324,We try to look at the actual outcomes that people experience when they have been negatively impacted.,92,,
807,0.97,5997.324,6003.163,"The most important, have you had a Cannabis conviction or felony?",92,,
808,0.97,6003.163,6007.401,Not necessarily an arrest.,92,,
809,0.97,6007.401,6014.108,Tons of people have been arrested for marijuana . It doesn't mean you have been negatively impacted.,92,,
810,0.97,6014.108,6022.249,The things that really make the most impact that are long- lasting is what we looked at.,92,,
811,0.97,6022.249,6025.285,Thank you.,93,,
812,0.97,6025.285,6031.325,"And to wrap us up, Davina, I see your hand up.",94,,
813,0.97,6031.325,6042.336,"I think one of the things that is interesting, and you probably heard a lot of this here, it can be a very localized determination.",95,,
814,0.97,6042.336,6050.411,"I worked for years in Hubbell County, which is overwhelmingly white but very much a Cannabis producing area.",95,,
815,0.97,6050.411,6060.02,Their decision on what they thought equity should be included at people that were sex trafficked as part of the industry.,95,,
816,0.97,6060.02,6071.799,We were hours away on dirt roads . It's pretty hard to escape from that situation.,95,,
817,0.97,6071.799,6075.903,As well as those that were legacy farmers who operated under the threat of arrest for a number of years.,95,,
818,0.97,6075.903,6087.047,I see that as a very different criteria than what we did in Sacramento and it sounds like what Denver and Oakland did.,95,,
819,0.97,6087.047,6089.283,We have to decide what makes sense for the community.,95,,
820,0.97,6089.283,6093.954,How are people impacted?,95,,
821,0.97,6093.954,6104.698,"The individual, the family, the greater family community and just the general community of people missing, right?",95,,
822,0.97,6104.698,6111.805,People ended up in prison over Cannabis for years and years.,95,,
823,0.97,6111.805,6114.441,I think it can really be a localized thing.,95,,
824,0.97,6114.441,6122.416,You get to really make it Impactful for your jurisdiction.,95,,
825,0.97,6122.416,6123.183,Thank you.,96,,
826,0.97,6123.183,6124.618,I think that is a good Segue.,96,,
827,0.97,6124.618,6137.297,We can have more questions him about the Finance and administered services Department has been looking at this question through the equity lens based on social justice initiatives and the task force within the Department.,96,,
828,0.97,6137.297,6138.232,I will transition over there.,96,,
829,0.97,6138.232,6144.338,"As we transition, please join me by giving a round of applause to our panelists today.",96,,
830,0.97,6144.338,6151.411,We will spend 20 to 30 minutes hearing from Finance administrative services who are on the line.,96,,

841,0.97,6211.138,6211.338,Okay.,100,,
842,0.97,6211.338,6229.423,"Hello, everyone, Council, chair Mosqueda . My name is Lachen Chernyha and I am the new strategic advisor for licensing for Cannabis . I will be continuing the work moving forward.",100,,
843,0.97,6229.423,6231.592,"I am here with my colleague, Rick Dimmer.",100,,
844,0.97,6231.592,6232.259,Rick?,100,,

846,0.97,6236.163,6245.672,My name is Rick Dimmer and I am a representative for this team.,101,,
847,0.97,6245.672,6259.953,We are here today to share a brief history of the Cannabis equity work and our findings of the Cannabis racial equity Toolkit and also to provide an overview of the next steps in continuing to bring this work forward.,102,,
848,0.97,6259.953,6266.326,I will turn it over to Rick to give us some brief background.,102,,
849,0.97,6266.326,6271.064,Rick?,102,,
850,0.97,6271.064,6272.065,Did we lose you?,103,,
851,0.97,6272.065,6273.9,"Oh, there you are.",104,,
852,0.97,6273.9,6276.336,"Good morning, everyone.",104,,
853,0.97,6276.336,6277.971,Let's start off with how we got here.,104,,
854,0.97,6277.971,6315.542,"The city and state passed a Cannabis license ordinance without considering social equity in the licensing . as a result, black business owners continue to be harmed and I would just like to say thank you to the community for sharing their history and their trauma . The city recognized this and took action by creating the racial equity Toolkit to take accountability and on how we can write these wrongs.",104,,
855,0.97,6315.542,6320.013,That is how we started out.,104,,
856,0.97,6320.013,6326.92,We are talking the whole family . We talked about the whole community be impacted.,104,,
857,0.97,6326.92,6328.288,We have shifted R.E.T.,104,,
858,0.97,6328.288,6331.291,To adhere to the words of the community.,104,,
859,0.97,6331.291,6339.199,I will send it back over to Lachen Chernyha to kick us off with the presentation.,104,,
860,0.97,6339.199,6349.876,"Thank you, Rick . as many of you know, in 2012, Washington and Colorado were the first States to Legalize recreational Cannabis.",105,,
861,0.97,6349.876,6355.148,"Due to the complex state licensing process and the lack of outreach to community, only those with wealth or capital were able to obtain licenses.",105,,
862,0.97,6355.148,6365.625,Importantly none of Seattle's existing medical operators were able to obtain licenses to continue operating in Seattle after recreational Cannabis was legalized.,105,,
863,0.97,6365.625,6375.001,"In 2020, lawmakers developed state social equity and Cannabis licensing program and further expanded the scope of that program in 2021.",105,,
864,0.97,6375.001,6383.377,State program is scheduled to begin accepting applications for social equity licensing this year in 2022.,105,,
865,0.97,6383.377,6392.252,"As I believe you are aware, there was legislation at the state level to create an extension of retail and across the state to social equity applicants.",105,,
866,0.97,6392.252,6393.954,However that legislation has died.,105,,
867,0.97,6393.954,6411.471,"As Councilmember Herbold just mentioned, that means currently the initial statewide license issue will be for the 38 unused existing licenses . 22 of which are designated for jurisdictions with bands, license caps, or moratoriums.",105,,
868,0.97,6411.471,6417.644,"Per that statewide framework, Seattle only received two equity licenses.",105,,
869,0.97,6417.644,6425.652,So the city and state have acted it to do harm in other ways.,105,,
870,0.97,6425.652,6430.323,"For example, criminal history can impact Cannabis business ownership.",105,,
871,0.97,6430.323,6439.933,"In 2018, the city attorney's office in the Mayor's office filed a motion with the municipal court to vacate convictions and to dismiss charges for misdemeanor Cannabis possession.",105,,
872,0.97,6439.933,6452.412,"In 2019, the state allowed to remove records with one Cannabis finish conviction and to vacate Misdemeanors if they were 21 years or older when they were charged.",105,,
873,0.97,6452.412,6458.752,"In 2018, Sas began a racial equity Toolkit, or R.E.T.",105,,
874,0.97,6458.752,6459.352,On the industry.,105,,
875,0.97,6459.352,6470.363,"In addition to FAS, and included the Department of inspections and the office for civil rights.",105,,
876,0.97,6470.363,6470.964,When this R.E.T.,105,,
877,0.97,6470.964,6476.903,"Started, it was focused on business licensing.",105,,
878,0.97,6476.903,6478.238,"However based on community feedback, the R.E.T.",105,,
879,0.97,6478.238,6493.487,"Outcomes were revised building a new systemic structure and centering black communities through . I believe affordable housing, Healthcare, education, and Reentry support.",105,,
880,0.97,6493.487,6511.805,"Business plan support and flexibility in the process, reinvesting proceeds into the black community, and rebuilding generational wealth . The team engaged nearly two dozen Stakeholder engagement, reaching over 200 community members and departments.",105,,
881,0.97,6511.805,6512.739,The R.E.T.,105,,
882,0.97,6512.739,6518.879,Team hosted a community forum in February of 2020.,105,,
883,0.97,6518.879,6532.893,It seems the city heard from the community were that the communities most impacted by prior marijuana laws should be the ones to receive assistance from equity efforts . accurate data collection should be based on where the impacted communities currently reside.,105,,
884,0.97,6532.893,6541.434,"Financial support in the form of access to banking, startup money, and business training.",105,,
885,0.97,6541.434,6546.539,"Include the medical marijuana patient community, since they are often not acknowledged or counted in the data.",105,,
886,0.97,6546.539,6551.177,The racial equity program needs to be viable given laws against preference based on race.,105,,
887,0.97,6551.177,6562.489,"I will head back to Rick, who will share additional feedback from Stakeholders, a proposed Timeline, and the key policy changes and next steps.",105,,
888,0.97,6562.489,6564.157,Rick?,105,,
889,0.97,6564.157,6564.991,Thank you.,106,,
890,0.97,6564.991,6570.43,Let me know if you guys are getting feedback from this presentation.,106,,
891,0.97,6570.43,6584.878,"So, Stakeholders and additional recommendations such as dedicating $1 million for the next 10 years to fund the equity program.",106,,
892,0.97,6584.878,6591.384,Vacate convictions and dismiss charges for possessions.,106,,
893,0.97,6591.384,6606.166,This work is to address the disparity between the black community for committing the same crime as their white Counterpartss receive Misdemeanors for.,106,,
894,0.97,6606.166,6614.24,"Looking at a proposed Timeline, these are just proposed Timelines.",106,,
895,0.97,6614.24,6631.424,"We would like to kick off 2022 with requesting to dedicate $1 million to the Seattle Cannabis equity program . looking at 2023 and 2024, to get into the implementation and launching the support of the Cannabis equity program through the office of economic development.",106,,
896,0.97,6631.424,6649.142,"That is where we will seek additional Cannabis retail licenses for Seattle and a 2024, partner with other city departments to implement a grant program for those most impacted by the war on drugs in Seattle.",106,,
897,0.97,6649.142,6670.363,"When we did the Stakeholder engagement with city departments, I believe we had 22 plus departments that reached out to participate Ecause the city is so big, we didn't want to take all of the resources when there are other city departments doing civil work that folks may need.",106,,
898,0.97,6670.363,6683.977,"The Department of neighborhood housing . We wanted to be very, very mindful.",106,,
899,0.97,6683.977,6708.068,"Some key policy changes, community engagement . FAS leadership team will build an alliance with the incoming Mayor and the physical resources to fund equity in Cannabis, social equity program within the industry.",106,,
900,0.97,6708.068,6730.123,"Some of those examples include equity in Cannabis licensing, including lowering fees for social equity applicants, reducing some of the folks talked about earlier, disbursement requirements, and working with STC I to figure that out as well.",106,,
901,0.97,6730.123,6742.368,"Providing more love the technical assistance, workforce development, Mentorship through the office of economic development as well.",106,,

904,0.97,6759.385,6763.957,We are happy to take any questions.,106,,
905,0.97,6763.957,6764.657,This was phenomenal.,107,,
906,0.97,6764.657,6765.458,Thank you so much.,107,,
907,0.97,6765.458,6786.212,"I know that the race and equity Toolkit presented in December, it was just one slide, maybe even just a bullet . It peaks my interest because I knew these conversations were happening around looking at what other jurisdictions were doing around social equity in relation to the Cannabis industry.",107,,
908,0.97,6786.212,6798.792,I am really thankful this is all happening . I see it Gerald is with us still.,107,,

913,0.97,6827.22,6827.687,Councilmember Nelson?,107,,
914,0.97,6827.687,6838.698,First I want to thank all of the panelists for coming today and talking about what you're jurisdictions have done in this area of equity in the Cannabis industry.,108,,
915,0.97,6838.698,6839.599,I fully support the goals.,108,,
916,0.97,6839.599,6855.248,"I learned today that Councilmember Herbold, you have long engagement in this issue and I am gathering that you helped form this team, this interdepartmental team that eventually turned into R.E.T.",108,,
917,0.97,6855.248,6858.318,. Thank you so much for putting that together.,108,,
918,0.97,6858.318,6860.553,The Toolkit is extremely important.,108,,
919,0.97,6860.553,6872.599,I just want to note that I fully support the limitation of the five key policy change recommendations.,108,,
920,0.97,6872.599,6902.996,"I understand that the city of Seattle does receive about $1.4 million from the state . You know, this is a question for off-line, but that is a good source of lending to get this off the ground and I don't know what that money is being used on currently but I support allocating it in part or all of it to moving forward on this.",108,,
921,0.97,6902.996,6925.952,"What I really like about this framework that FAS is presenting, it is consistent with the work at the Cannabis social equity task force for the task force on social equity in Cannabis is doing already.",108,,
922,0.97,6925.952,6930.423,I just want to highlight some of the groundbreaking work that Washington has done for those that don't know.,108,,
923,0.97,6930.423,6936.062,"It is called the social act would be of Cannabis task force, by the way.",108,,
924,0.97,6936.062,6953.579,70 authorized eliminated a number of Cannabis retail licenses to applicants and they re defined as very similar to someone who lives in a disproportionately impacted area and has been convicted of a Cannabis offense.,108,,
925,0.97,6953.579,6967.593,They have a family member impacted by a Cannabis related offense et cetera . The fact that it is in line with what the state is already doing is positive for me and it makes our work easier.,108,,
926,0.97,6967.593,6977.136,The presentation mentioned the data collection that FAS it will do.,108,,
927,0.97,6977.136,6993.586,"By that, do you mean collection or analysis of the status of equity in Seattle's retail stores when it comes to employees already working at these stores?",108,,
928,0.97,6993.586,7007.6,"If that hasn't been done, I think that would be a great Avenue, just to survey how many people working in these stores already who already represent some of this criteria.",108,,
929,0.97,7007.6,7012.138,That would be really helpful information for us moving forward.,108,,
930,0.97,7012.138,7027.72,"In preparation for this discussion, I can reach out to Ali Garrett, a member of the Lcc be and also President who advocates for black businesses in the region.",108,,
931,0.97,7027.72,7054.68,"When talking about a social equity Fund and a potential tax because I think this is where the conversation is going based on the presentation and what was said in the previous Committee, she mentioned she is concerned about that because it could negatively impact our shops here.",108,,
932,0.97,7054.68,7065.691,She mentioned sales are not a good indication of the cost to operate these businesses and it would likely hurt.,108,,
933,0.97,7065.691,7077.87,"When we talk about small businesses, we talk about those owned by people who lack capital, whose sales are lower, who don't have multiple locations, et cetera.",108,,
934,0.97,7077.87,7084.343,That is one thing going forward we should engage with on some of these issues.,108,,
935,0.97,7084.343,7094.787,"You know, I have other questions but I really appreciate this and I will let Councilmember Herbold talk because she will probably answer them.",108,,
936,0.97,7094.787,7095.555,Thanks.,108,,
937,0.97,7095.555,7097.59,Thank you.,109,,
938,0.97,7097.59,7106.966,"I think some of the questions are for future discussion among another Committee, but Councilmember Herbold, I see your hand up.",109,,
939,0.97,7106.966,7107.533,Please feel free.,109,,
940,0.97,7107.533,7117.677,"I know FAS may have comments as well, selected your question in there and they can answer as well.",109,,
941,0.97,7117.677,7123.216,"For the record, I mentioned earlier in 2028 2021, I worked to lobby for the state legislation.",110,,
942,0.97,7123.216,7151.611,I had nothing to do with FAS setting up a social equity effort . credit goes to them responding to what they heard at the social equity forum that the city hosted to talk about exactly this issue.,110,,
943,0.97,7151.611,7153.846,I apologize for not giving credit where credit is due.,111,,
944,0.97,7153.846,7154.08,Sorry.,111,,
945,0.97,7154.08,7163.789,I'm not trying to give you a hard time for that.,112,,
946,0.97,7163.789,7165.024,I just didn't get any credit.,112,,
947,0.97,7165.024,7165.825,I get it.,113,,
948,0.97,7165.825,7166.425,Thank you.,114,,
949,0.97,7166.425,7176.202,"I appreciate Councilmember Nelson, your reference to the tax climate for small businesses and specifically this business.",114,,
950,0.97,7176.202,7183.91,We know the state sales tax as opposed to some other jurisdictions might be small.,114,,
951,0.97,7183.91,7185.077,6.5%.,114,,
952,0.97,7185.077,7194.887,The state has a tax that is a very large excise tax . Seattle has a flat regulatory fee.,114,,
953,0.97,7194.887,7219.445,"A few years ago, we raised--and I actually was a cosponsor of that increase along with former Councilmember Burgess, we raised the regulatory fee because we want to recapture the cost associated with the regulation, which includes significant annual inspections.",114,,
954,0.97,7219.445,7256.616,"The rate right now, the regulatory fee is about $3500 a year and I have been working with FAS on and off again to fulfill a commitment I made when I took that position to look at ways in which the FAS, city inspections associated with the FAS fee are Duplicative of state inspections and to look at equity and some of the smaller operations.",114,,
955,0.97,7256.616,7284.644,I know that FAS does have a proposal . They were anticipating we would make an adjustment consistent with that proposal in the 2021 proposed budget that would take into account factors such as reduced staff time necessary because of changes from an annual inspection once every two years.,114,,
956,0.97,7284.644,7301.127,I know from FAS they have informed me that the previous administration didn't support that proposal and I really am looking forward to an update on the Nitty-Gritty on what that proposal is.,114,,
957,0.97,7301.127,7307.4,"Again, we are talking about some sort of additional task to support an equity fund locally in Seattle.",114,,
958,0.97,7307.4,7319.378,I really want to fulfill the commitment I made it to the industry and look at increasing them as well.,114,,
959,0.97,7319.378,7320.613,That is not a question.,114,,
960,0.97,7320.613,7322.648,It is more of a statement.,114,,
961,0.97,7322.648,7329.355,I do have a question for Stakeholders on slide seven.,114,,
962,0.97,7329.355,7351.21,That is specifically I appreciate you lifting the work by vacating 500 convictions as it relates to dismissing convictions.,114,,
963,0.97,7351.21,7360.086,As the city have the power to file this motion or does another jurisdiction?,114,,
964,0.97,7360.086,7367.326,"Secondly, in our last discussion--and I didn't see it.",114,,
965,0.97,7367.326,7397.59,"I know we are working with different groups of Stakeholders and there might be overlap, but the recommendations we heard in Councilmembers Mosqueda's meeting was not just demand for vacating sentences but for Expungement's . I am wondering if state law prohibits Expungements? could they perhaps be on a city level even if banned by state law?",114,,
966,0.97,7397.59,7409.835,"Even if we're talking about Expungements for things that are no longer crimes, I'm interested to know whether or not you have taken a look at that issue at all.",114,,
967,0.97,7409.835,7410.403,Thanks.,114,,
968,0.97,7410.403,7412.838,Thank you.,115,,
969,0.97,7412.838,7414.44,Great questions and great comments.,115,,
970,0.97,7414.44,7423.416,"In terms of does the city have authority, we spoke with folks I believe yesterday or the day before.",115,,
971,0.97,7423.416,7425.217,The city doesn't have the ability to do that.,115,,
972,0.97,7425.217,7431.423,"What could become helpful, the mayors are needed to make those decisions.",115,,
973,0.97,7431.423,7451.844,"I love the fact that the Expungement versus vacate because we talk about the impact on individuals who have felony convictions, their livelihood is impacted gravely when they are talking about access to housing, access to jobs.",115,,
974,0.97,7451.844,7455.08,We would love to look at how that is done.,115,,
975,0.97,7455.08,7475.201,The community has asked and we don't know what it's going to take to get it done but that is where we work on that together and with your support . Thank you to the FAS leadership board for supporting everything the community has asked for.,115,,
976,0.97,7475.201,7478.838,We are here to figure out how to get this done.,115,,
977,0.97,7478.838,7483.275,We don't know exactly where the funding is going to come from.,115,,
978,0.97,7483.275,7494.353,"You know, it is to the tune of $600,000 . We could redirect dollars.",115,,
979,0.97,7494.353,7496.689,We don't know where it's going to come from.,115,,
980,0.97,7496.689,7501.66,"In 2022, we will figure this out for the community at large.",115,,
981,0.97,7501.66,7519.678,Also I do support the Budtender S. we did not go into the stores to speak with the Budtenders . I don't even know what that would look like.,115,,
982,0.97,7519.678,7521.814,"Hey, I want to have a conversation with your Budtender.",115,,
983,0.97,7521.814,7537.129,We did reach out during our form that we had to community at large . We had business owners there.,115,,
984,0.97,7537.129,7542.034,We were not sure if we had much in the space.,115,,
985,0.97,7542.034,7572.097,"With all of the work and all of the different folks who were part of this engagement or who have been impacted, adding a Budtender to the support versus not doing this at all, anyone impacted are at most harm . We don't want to see is communities separate and we don't want to start it.",115,,
986,0.97,7572.097,7581.64,"We want to bring everyone together and create some that will serve the folks that are most harmed, whoever that may be.",115,,
987,0.97,7581.64,7584.843,Thank you so much.,116,,
988,0.97,7584.843,7590.816,"Councilmember Herbold, did you have an additional follow-up question or anything to add?",116,,
989,0.97,7590.816,7594.42,I think we covered it.,117,,
990,0.97,7594.42,7595.287,That's good.,117,,
991,0.97,7595.287,7598.958,I guess we have one more question.,118,,
992,0.97,7598.958,7606.231,"Going back to the question I asked the previous panel for FAS, what are your thoughts?",118,,
993,0.97,7606.231,7615.708,"If we have two equity licenses right now that we don't have the zoning capacity because of the restrictions, should we get working on that?",118,,

995,0.97,7621.447,7628.687,One of our partners was the folks that look at permitting and zoning.,119,,
996,0.97,7628.687,7635.661,They worked hand in hand with us.,119,,
997,0.97,7635.661,7637.83,We were looking at--what was it?,119,,
998,0.97,7637.83,7647.64,"Oh, exemptions and opening some of the districts, like Pioneer square.",119,,
999,0.97,7647.64,7649.274,Working with you all to do that.,119,,
1000,0.97,7649.274,7657.182,Also thinking about 400 for the mayors office.,119,,
1001,0.97,7657.182,7660.219,We lost 450 businesses during Covid.,119,,
1002,0.97,7660.219,7668.794,"If we have two licenses, somewhere working with Sdci can pinpoint where the two licenses can go.",119,,
1003,0.97,7668.794,7675.267,Some folks talked about real estate and retail space.,119,,
1004,0.97,7675.267,7682.174,"If you look around the downtown area, you will see for a very long time.",119,,
1005,0.97,7682.174,7696.188,I'm sure they will be welcome to get somewhere within the corridor so we can help revitalize the owners there too.,119,,
1006,0.97,7696.188,7698.824,Thank you very much.,120,,

1011,0.97,7727.686,7738.931,"There is much in the works already, so how do we start to channel some of the shared interests and doing something relatively quickly so we can create a more equitable recovery in the wake of Covid?",120,,
1012,0.97,7738.931,7741.3,"Rick, I can see your hand up.",120,,
