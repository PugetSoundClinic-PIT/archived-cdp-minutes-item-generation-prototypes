43,0.97,155.155,160.126,But now this morning a new version of amendment nine was distributed.,22,,
44,0.97,160.126,164.13,And it eliminated any conflict between the proposals.,22,,
45,0.97,164.13,172.438,"So instead of having this table in 41 of you, I'm going to go ahead and move to the effect statement related to amendment eight.",22,,
46,0.97,172.438,177.977,This amendment is sponsored by Council members Herbold and Mosqueda.,22,,
47,0.97,177.977,198.498,"This ALLOCATES 5% of the funds under the housing and services spending category to investments in permanently affordable home ownership programs serving households with incomes up to 80% of area median income, and decreases by 5% the funds allocated for the affordable rental housing investment.",22,,

57,0.97,240.773,255.688,Thank you Againism appreciate having the support and Cosponsorship of chair Mosqueda on this amendment and her office's partnership while adopting it.,28,,
58,0.97,255.688,266.766,It would set aside a modest amount of reliable funding for permanent household opportunities for households making up to 80% AMI.,28,,
59,0.97,266.766,276.342,And the funds would specifically be reserved for households at risk of displacement from their communities or have faced barriers to home ownership.,28,,
60,0.97,276.342,279.278,Due to past Discriminator policies and practices.,28,,
61,0.97,279.278,282.548,Deadlining and restrictive racial covenants.,28,,

63,0.97,292.859,300.5,"As we know, home ownership is key to building Intergenerational wealth and a key driver of the racial wealth gap.",28,,
64,0.97,300.5,307.173,While the Finisheds appropriated here would not address that problem at scale.,28,,
65,0.97,307.173,322.922,It would give more households every year the opportunity to bridge that gap for their own families after being shut out from this opportunity by Seattle's own past Discriminator policies.,28,,
66,0.97,322.922,331.23,This funding could result from anywhere to 35 to 100 new permanently affordable home ownership opportunities per year.,28,,
67,0.97,331.23,335.435,"This is, I think, pretty significant of an accomplishment.",28,,
68,0.97,335.435,338.638,Both at the high end and the low end of the scale.,28,,
69,0.97,338.638,344.41,In Seattle's housing market.,28,,

72,0.97,355.355,374.04,Your collaboration on this amendment and your focus on making sure there's investments going into permanently affordable home ownership for those who have been especially denied home ownership opportunities in the past due to a history of Discriminator practices such as Redlining and racist Cov innocents in Seattle is really impressive.,29,,

74,0.97,379.679,389.422,"We have heard a call for investments in home ownership for communities who for generations have been harmed by Discriminator practices, particularly among black communities.",29,,
75,0.97,389.422,394.127,And this amendment really works toward a broader Strateg of investing in these communities.,29,,
76,0.97,394.127,412.979,And importantly this funding will also be available for program support and Capacity-Building for Commune-Led organizations who are looking to build out home ownership opportunity programs tailored to those communes they serve.,29,,
77,0.97,412.979,416.282,A huge amount of thanks to you and to your staff as well.,29,,

103,0.97,484.483,488.621,The changes that are on.,48,,
104,0.97,490.723,494.46,I have put the effect description on the screen.,49,,
105,0.97,494.46,503.069,This amendment would increase the allocation of funds under the housing and services category by 2%.,49,,

109,0.97,532.131,534.1,And it assumes--let's see.,49,,
110,0.97,534.1,540.573,There is another version that assumes passage of amendment 8. so they are not in conflict.,49,,
111,0.97,540.573,544.911,And I'll just get that pulled up for you.,49,,
112,0.97,544.911,547.847,While you all talk amongst yourselves.,49,,
113,0.97,547.847,553.819,"Sawant, the original sponsor of amendment 9, would you like to move amendment Nooib 9-B?",50,,

123,0.97,593.459,622.121,"I am proud to be bringing forward this amendment 9-B which will dedication a portion raised by Amazon and other big businesses to move into--a new decade, and currently ongoing economic--of black and Brown community members.",53,,
124,0.97,622.121,624.29,We've heard officials declare that black lives matter.,53,,
125,0.97,624.29,632.365,"The vote on the city council from this, this comes straight from the community and the justice movement.",53,,
126,0.97,632.365,640.539,One way in which those words can be Concretized by passing the very progressive Amazon tax.,53,,
127,0.97,640.539,651.25,And the activists and community members who are watching will remember this discussion today as a direct result of the historic Amazon tax the movement would able to pass.,53,,
128,0.97,651.25,666.966,This is not the amendment that I originally introduced which would have invested a full $50 million per year in housing for working people.,53,,
129,0.97,666.966,670.536,With respect to affordable housing for black and Brown poorer communities.,53,,
130,0.97,670.536,676.776,I do think it is unfortunate that other Council members have not joined me in supporting that demand from the community.,53,,
131,0.97,676.776,680.78,Specifically some leading clergy in the black community and faith leaders.,53,,
132,0.97,680.78,694.86,"But this amendment is also more than what the political establishment perhaps would otherwise have originally proposed our dedicated housing for our black commune, which was originally nothing.",53,,
133,0.97,694.86,695.061,Zero.,53,,
134,0.97,695.061,700.966,"So we now have--when we pass this amendment, we will have a commitment of at least $18 million.",53,,
135,0.97,700.966,710.609,And I wanted to really thank everybody who has provided the advocacy and leadership from hundreds of community members.,53,,
136,0.97,710.609,723.022,"But especially led by Reverend Robert Jeffrey and many other black clergy, other clergy of color, and faith community as a whole.",53,,
137,0.97,723.022,724.223,It's a very diverse faith community.,53,,
138,0.97,724.223,737.837,"And I want to thank all the young advocates in justice for George Floyd movement in Seattle on whose courageous recognize and progress movement any of the decrees that we're winning in this context, yes.",53,,
139,0.97,737.837,741.207,And so I wanted to thank everybody who has been part of that.,53,,
140,0.97,741.207,749.115,"And everybody who has been part of the tax Amazon movement, without whom again we wouldn't have won that historic Amazon tax last year.",53,,
141,0.97,749.115,764.93,This amendment will ensure that for the first time funds will be set aside beginning in 2020 and every year following to build affordable housing in districts to provide affordable housing for black and poor families.,53,,
142,0.97,764.93,766.365,It's about $18 million a year.,53,,
143,0.97,766.365,769.301,And I want to clarify the investments are not a ceiling.,53,,
144,0.97,769.301,775.975,"Because other housing funds in the Amazon tax, what we call spending resolution, this amendment is a part of.",53,,
145,0.97,775.975,784.383,The housing rally and other sources can and should be accessed for affordable housing development in these very important neighborhoods.,53,,
146,0.97,784.383,789.455,"But we need affordable housing for all communities throughout the city, of course.",53,,
147,0.97,789.455,793.859,And I thank Council members Mosqueda and Morales for the Cosponsorship of this amendment.,53,,
148,0.97,793.859,797.696,I hope that other Council members will also support it.,53,,
149,0.97,797.696,800.966,I wanted to just quickly provide some additional context for this amendment.,53,,
150,0.97,800.966,807.273,Because I know that it has come to light because of the grassroots advocacy and organizing in community.,53,,
151,0.97,807.273,819.885,"In June in the midst of the justice for George Floyd movement, several leading black clergy issued a challenge to the political establishment.",53,,
152,0.97,819.885,844.643,"Reverend Jeffries, the new hope missionary Baptist church, Florence Villas, of true Holiness Baptist church, and all wrote a letter to the Mayor and the city council stating, quote, ""as city leader, we must acknowledge the persistence of institutional racism that has decimated Seattle's African-American population.",53,,
153,0.97,844.643,851.483,"Compared to other racial groups, African-Americans have the highest arrest rate in King County and the highest conviction rate in the state.",53,,
154,0.97,851.483,865.965,"This is why the black lives matter movement is so important and why so many of us have taken to the streets to protest racial injustice, economic inequality, police brutality and mass Incarceration.",53,,
155,0.97,865.965,883.315,"The displacement of longtime African-American residents is a result of racist policies that initiated in segregation, racial governments, Redlining, and new Gentriification.",53,,
156,0.97,883.315,889.455,"""Let me take those on the Council and Mayor and city council adopt this central housing plan.",53,,
157,0.97,889.455,911.61,"The core of this plan also included building tiny House villages and Defunding the place was the call for the city to build 1,000 new affordable homes in the central strict to re--to begin to reverse the fate of Gentrification.",53,,
158,0.97,911.61,925.724,"And my city council office SEES black clergy and other faith leaders on June 18th outside new hope church, we had a press conference where we committed to fund to build these 1,000 homes.",53,,
159,0.97,925.724,934.9,"The faith leaders have pointed out that while the central district used to be overwhelmingly black, a struggling but culturally vibrant community, today it is less than 18% black.",53,,
160,0.97,934.9,937.436,This is dramatic and stunning.,53,,
161,0.97,937.436,944.443,Soaring rents and home prices have systematically driven our African-American families over the years.,53,,
162,0.97,944.443,955.654,They spoke eloquently about their vision of bringing back people who have been economically exited from the community to rebuild the neighborhood's past vibrancy and diversity.,53,,
163,0.97,955.654,959.325,But they were also very clear that this will take money.,53,,
164,0.97,959.325,961.193,We can't do this with words.,53,,
165,0.97,961.193,961.66,We need dollars.,53,,
166,0.97,961.66,966.532,And the city must provide those dollars.,53,,
167,0.97,966.532,981.046,"As Reverend Terry Anderson said, quote, ""simply put, black lives matter, then affordable housing for black families in the Seattle area should matter, quote,"".",53,,

169,0.97,986.819,996.095,I want to share a specifically example to Council members so they and the public understand the city's role.,53,,
170,0.97,996.095,1006.405,Perhaps you may have read it in the Oped by Reverend Willis and Jane that was just published yesterday.,53,,
171,0.97,1006.405,1017.449,"In 1969, the Minister at new hope church in the heart of the central district was approached by city of Seattle officials selling the parking lot to the city for $34,000.",53,,

173,0.97,1024.089,1028.293,"It wasn't a willing sale, it was coerced.",53,,
174,0.97,1028.293,1032.231,At that time his appeal fell on deaf ears and the church was forced to tell.,53,,
175,0.97,1032.231,1041.34,"Today we are told that property is worth $2 million, more than eight times the inflation adjusted price of the 1969 property sale.",53,,

182,0.97,1096.695,1099.264,The letters are too numerous for me to mention here.,53,,
183,0.97,1099.264,1107.773,But I do want to read one excerpt from the letter from the church Council of greater Seattle.,53,,
184,0.97,1107.773,1117.516,"Michael Ramos who says, quote, ""justice demand action to pave the way for the building of 1,000 new affordable homes oriented to the black community in the central district.",53,,
185,0.97,1117.516,1119.818,The black lives of Seattle matter.,53,,
186,0.97,1119.818,1138.937,"Targeting funding for the basic human right of housing moves the needle to achieve the religious principle of efficient, sustainable livelihood for all ."" then he concluded by saying, quote, ""in time we will be judged by how our frontline workers, the majority of whom are people of color are treated.",53,,
187,0.97,1138.937,1147.613,We will be judged by how we open our doors to people experiencing homelessness in one of the richest countries in the richest nation in the world.,53,,
188,0.97,1147.613,1162.528,We will be judged by how we respected and Prioritized black lives by saying their having an affordable home matters in Seattle Sxflt Finally we will be judged by our courage and our humility.,53,,
189,0.97,1162.528,1168.834,"To our elected leaders, to they bend to the corporate interests or city dwellers?",53,,
190,0.97,1168.834,1175.774,"Or bend the odds to justice ever more slightly in doing what is right and restore the integrity of the city?"" so that is the choice.",53,,
191,0.97,1175.774,1180.646,Whether the political establishment will bend to powerful corporate interests or stand with working people.,53,,
192,0.97,1180.646,1185.484,"Again, I thank Council members Mosqueda and Morales for joining with me.",53,,
193,0.97,1185.484,1204.97,And I hope all the Council members join with the 228 faith leaders and activists and thousands in community and the people's justice movement who are saying we need to Prioritize and actually fund dollars to Prioritize black working households to move into the central district Affordably.,53,,
194,0.97,1204.97,1212.711,"And today's amendment, if it passes, will be a big victory for the community demanding this.",53,,
195,0.97,1212.711,1217.049,It will not be the end but it will certainly be a step forward.,53,,

198,0.97,1220.419,1227.826,"Council member Morales, as the lead sponsor of amendment 10, which was in the staff memo, and cosponsor on amendment 9, would you like to speak to this amendment?",54,,
199,0.97,1227.826,1231.029,"Sure, thank you.",55,,
200,0.97,1231.029,1237.97,"I do start by thanking Council member Sawant, and Council member Mosqueda for working together on this.",55,,
201,0.97,1237.97,1243.942,I am withdrawing amendment 10.,55,,
202,0.97,1243.942,1255.153,That amendment would have reduced economic revitalization line item by 1% to increase the Pdi by 1%.,55,,
203,0.97,1255.153,1260.058,The 2% that's been pulled out has moved into the community fund under housing services.,55,,
204,0.97,1260.058,1262.861,With the understanding of the amendments that we passed earlier.,55,,
205,0.97,1262.861,1266.765,That that would be in partnership with Pdi.,55,,
206,0.97,1266.765,1285.25,Which is a very complicated way of saying that we are achieving the same goal here.,55,,
207,0.97,1316.181,1324.623,Popower and resources of this institution this particular is a priority for me.,55,,
208,0.97,1324.623,1328.126,The neighbors who we heard from are worried.,55,,
209,0.97,1328.126,1333.699,As one caller mentioned this morning about white supremacy within these institutions.,55,,
210,0.97,1333.699,1343.241,They're tired of fighting over stress and be pitted against one another.,55,,
211,0.97,1343.241,1354.052,"An economic development initiative is important in particular because there are limited residential resources, actually, that hinder the redevelopment of some of these projects.",55,,
212,0.97,1354.052,1356.988,And that can really affect how these projects procedure.,55,,
213,0.97,1356.988,1361.159,Or whether they're able to proceed if they don't have sufficient paths.,55,,
214,0.97,1361.159,1369.134,"That's why, for example, the food innovation center that we just heard about late last week took so long.",55,,
215,0.97,1369.134,1373.672,Because there wasn't sufficient capital for a side acquisition.,55,,
216,0.97,1373.672,1377.442,"It's why at the Ethiopian community center, Childcare got eliminated.",55,,
217,0.97,1377.442,1380.679,It's why the Rainier Valley food bank was in jeopardy.,55,,
218,0.97,1380.679,1392.19,Because there wasn't enough money to make their Groundfloor part of a housing project possible.,55,,
219,0.97,1392.19,1403.101,This gives Kaes to the Capitaled Meed to drive decisions and it's why I've been advocating so hard to make sure we have Increasd funding available for Edi.,55,,
220,0.97,1403.101,1406.905,Many of these projects don't have a housing component at all.,55,,
221,0.97,1406.905,1409.975,But they're providing important services to our communes.,55,,
222,0.97,1409.975,1419.584,"Childcare, food security, Healthcare like the Rainier Valley Midwive comes is one of the projects that's in, Midwives, which is one of the projects that's in line next.",55,,
223,0.97,1419.584,1431.53,"I do want to say that according to Decolonizing wealth, only about 8% of philanthropic dollars go to communities of color.",55,,
224,0.97,1431.53,1438.403,The current funding environment relies on Philanthropy to bridge the gaps that public Funders leave.,55,,
225,0.97,1438.403,1443.141,"For Edi projects, this means a much longer process to complete the capital campaign.",55,,
226,0.97,1443.141,1446.244,Because it's hard to raise money from outside of your community.,55,,
227,0.97,1446.244,1454.619,And the racial wealth gap that we've all been talking about makes it difficult to raise significant amounts of money from within our targeted communities.,55,,
228,0.97,1454.619,1457.756,So that is white supremacy.,55,,
229,0.97,1457.756,1458.857,That is structural racism at play.,55,,
230,0.97,1458.857,1469.034,And that's why I think this is so important.,55,,
231,0.97,1469.034,1480.479,"In light of the recent calls to invest in communities of color, this Council has been loud in committing to--it's important that we take action in as many ways as possible.",55,,
232,0.97,1480.479,1485.383,And I'm looking forward to the next conversation that we're having about rebalancing.,55,,
233,0.97,1485.383,1490.622,"Buttad I said before, we owe the black and indigenous communities about 500 year worth of investment.",55,,
234,0.97,1490.622,1497.496,And amending this bill to add another 2% for Edi and housing projects can help reverse the des placement.,55,,
235,0.97,1497.496,1498.864,And it's a small price to pay.,55,,
236,0.97,1498.864,1500.699,I look forward to this amendment.,55,,
237,0.97,1500.699,1517.315,And I look forward to continuing to add funds to Edi Througout the rest of the budget process.,55,,
238,0.97,1517.315,1522.487,"Colleagues, I'll speak to this amend.",56,,
239,0.97,1522.487,1522.921,Amendment.,56,,
240,0.97,1522.921,1532.864,I was really pleased to bring this forward together to combine multiple efforts here.,56,,
241,0.97,1532.864,1544.276,"It includes $20 million for the Edi program, as well as the $18 million that will go to creating long-term investments for housing projects that address the impacts of Seattle's legacy of Discriminator policies.",56,,
242,0.97,1544.276,1555.52,"This is intended to be the housing specific long-term fund that can be used for acquisition, construction, and program support for capacity building and operations of Community-Based housing.",56,,
243,0.97,1555.52,1563.795,"And specifically, this amendment adds additional funding from the economic revitalization and labor funding source to further enhance Community-Phobesed funds.",56,,
244,0.97,1563.795,1598.496,"We have defined the language in this amendment in terms of addressing the legacy of Discriminator policies, specifically so that we can focus on investments in longtime black and indigenous communities and other communities that have been harmed by these policies of Redlining and Discriminator housing policies while also complying with their housing laws.",56,,
245,0.97,1598.496,1610.809,"And make sure that we're leaving more in community, more funding in community, more housing in communities, more opportunity in communities who have been historically harmed by past Discriminator policies.",56,,
246,0.97,1610.809,1618.116,And this funding source will comply with Edi as you already heard from the into sponsors.,56,,
247,0.97,1618.116,1622.721,It allows us to broaden our housing fund in partnership with Edi.,56,,
248,0.97,1622.721,1631.029,"And the intent is to really make sure that we get projects out of this funding that are led by black, indigenous and people of color organizations.",56,,
249,0.97,1631.029,1634.666,Serving these communities both through community organizations and through direct housing assistance.,56,,
250,0.97,1634.666,1649.447,"In addition to the community funds, we have included investments in deeply affordable housing with a strong housing that addresses Redlining and past Discriminator practices.",56,,
251,0.97,1649.447,1658.757,As well as Prioritizing Community-Based projects that advance economic development goals.,56,,
252,0.97,1658.757,1660.525,I'm really excited about the possibility here.,56,,
253,0.97,1660.525,1688.319,"Back of the envelope, we are estimating that we can now create between 2,500 to 2,300 opinion the first five years and making sure we're using those investments to invest in the low-income housing, particularly to address problems with homelessness and Sglament which disproportionately affects low-income communities.",56,,
254,0.97,1688.319,1691.122,I want to thank everyone who worked on this amendment.,56,,

367,0.97,2067.065,2071.469,Is still ample time to have a conversation about the budget.,95,,

376,0.97,2116.38,2118.316,It is just a presentation.,95,,

378,0.97,2122.22,2126.023,"Oh, you are on mute.",95,,
379,0.97,2126.023,2134.332,"And for our guests, that are going to be joining us, we will make sure to try to get to that about 3:30 at the latest, 3:45.",95,,

385,0.97,2144.809,2152.15,"And I'm joined by, I think, most of the central staff team.",96,,
386,0.97,2152.15,2156.954,If not all.,96,,
387,0.97,2156.954,2164.862,"My Copresenters, and I will walk through each of the pieces of the Powerpoint presentation.",96,,
388,0.97,2164.862,2165.563,Separat questions.,96,,
389,0.97,2165.563,2172.069,"And if time allows, we would like for you to hold questions until the end of each segment.",96,,
390,0.97,2172.069,2181.679,"But if time is running short, we are happy to take your questions Offline or leave it to the end of the presentation.",96,,
391,0.97,2181.679,2185.783,"Before I begin, I'd like to personally thank the entire central staff team.",96,,
392,0.97,2185.783,2190.087,I know that we are spending a lot of time thanking each other.,96,,
393,0.97,2190.087,2192.957,And it's very much appreciated.,96,,
394,0.97,2192.957,2200.164,But their Dederation and their tireless work these past few months have just been phenomenal.,96,,
395,0.97,2200.164,2202.7,And I just want to say thank you to them.,96,,
396,0.97,2202.7,2211.008,But I would also like to thank two individuals in particular.,96,,
397,0.97,2211.008,2214.078,Lisa Kaye and Patty Meblum.,96,,
398,0.97,2214.078,2220.184,Lisa has almost single Handedly developed a summer budget process for Council to balance the 2020 budget.,96,,
399,0.97,2220.184,2228.626,"This is in the history, as far as I'm aware, the first in our history.",96,,
400,0.97,2228.626,2241.939,I would also like to acknowledge Patty Wiggin whose work is mostly behind the scenes but is extremely critical to the success of our team.,96,,
401,0.97,2241.939,2250.448,"As the executive assistant, she is fiercely protective of meeting agenda deadlines along with the deputy clerk.",96,,
402,0.97,2250.448,2255.753,"And I just want to say that the Powerpoint that he sent out to us, the delay had nothing to do with them.",96,,
403,0.97,2255.753,2263.06,It had to do with the workload and just trying to finish up all of the other materials last night by the deadline.,96,,
404,0.97,2263.06,2271.068,"So with that, I would like to turn to my introductory and context setting piece.",96,,
405,0.97,2271.068,2280.478,The city as you know is facing major challenges both in terms of a significant budget deficit.,96,,
406,0.97,2280.478,2285.249,And the need to respond safely and effectively to the Covid crisis.,96,,
407,0.97,2285.249,2291.555,"In some ways, many cities including Seattle are balancing their budgets to a moving target.",96,,
408,0.97,2291.555,2294.692,This moving target really makes things difficult.,96,,
409,0.97,2294.692,2301.265,"Nevertheless in the next few weeks, this Council will evaluate the Mayor's proposed 2020 rebalancing package.",96,,
410,0.97,2301.265,2306.07,And we'll be faced with making numerous decisions.,96,,
411,0.97,2306.07,2321.519,Your evaluation and decisions will be informed by the public Testimonies and hearing that you held on July 8th as well as today's presentation and more than 20 central staff issued papers which have been attached to the agenda.,96,,
412,0.97,2321.519,2324.522,Next slide.,96,,
413,0.97,2324.522,2330.528,I'd like to take a moment to look at the numbers.,96,,
414,0.97,2330.528,2339.303,The June forecast update shows a $311 million revenue shortfall for all funds.,96,,
415,0.97,2339.303,2360.358,"On the expenditure side, the city has incurred added costs to address the Covid emergency, specifically the executive is currently spending about $233 million in 2020 from a variety of funding sources.",96,,
416,0.97,2360.358,2374.371,"Slide 3, page 3 reflects the general fund Covid fiscal challenge resulting in a def Silt of $378 million as noted on the bottom of this slide.",96,,
417,0.97,2374.371,2379.977,The general fund was the primary focus of the executive's rebalancing effort.,96,,
418,0.97,2379.977,2393.391,"As we know, the general fund supports the lion's share of the city's programs, including the city police Department, which Greg will speak to here shortly, and the human services Department.",96,,
419,0.97,2393.391,2419.316,"Of this amount, the $378 million, $210 million comes just from the general Fund and the revenue changes that are associated with the Seattle center and the parks and recreation Department due to event cancellations and vendor and community center Closurs.",96,,
420,0.97,2419.316,2434.331,This $210 amount also reflects the Mauments to the short-term rental tax and the state and beverage tax.,96,,
421,0.97,2434.331,2444.408,"That amount is made up with capital and operating Rucks, most of it coming from Transportation-Related adjustments to--or in STBD.",96,,
422,0.97,2444.408,2445.443,The commercial parking tax.,96,,
423,0.97,2445.443,2448.846,The school zone Fund and the real estate excise tax.,96,,
424,0.97,2448.846,2451.182,'m throwing out AIL of numbers.,96,,
425,0.97,2451.182,2457.288,And I have been hearing from you that sometimes following these numbers is really difficult.,96,,
426,0.97,2457.288,2461.125,"And in the interest of time, I am cutting short the explanations.",96,,
427,0.97,2461.125,2471.268,"But I am happy, as are the budget coordinator, Tom Rexel, to answer any questions Offline.",96,,
428,0.97,2471.268,2488.853,"So let's move to page 4. if switching from the general fund to all funds calculation, switching from revenues to expenditures.",96,,
429,0.97,2488.853,2494.492,"Makes things difficult to follow, there is an added layer of complexity in the Council's rebalancing effort.",96,,
430,0.97,2494.492,2498.395,This is due to the Newly-Added challenges created by the current crisis.,96,,
431,0.97,2498.395,2503.0,Among these are time or the lack of time.,96,,
432,0.97,2503.0,2504.001,Funding restrictions.,96,,
433,0.97,2504.001,2508.172,The ongoing response to homelessness and affordable housing.,96,,
434,0.97,2508.172,2512.61,And the anticipated slow economic recovery.,96,,
435,0.97,2512.61,2523.087,"In fact the 2021 general fund budget deficit is, I think, currently estimated to be about $290 million.",96,,
436,0.97,2523.087,2527.725,"We're also hearing--sorry, slide 5.",96,,
437,0.97,2527.725,2536.333,We're also hearing demands from the public to eliminate institutional racism and Reimagine the city's policing.,96,,
438,0.97,2536.333,2545.609,"From a technical standpoint, we also lack the tools to easily track these significant Mid-Year adjustments in a remote work environment.",96,,
439,0.97,2545.609,2557.655,"As some of you have noted, the proposed rebalancing package didn't come with a comprehensive balance sheet for what as I mentioned in my opening comments is a moving target.",96,,
440,0.97,2557.655,2576.073,Central staff will endeavor to create a balancing sheet for the budget chair and/or the council as a whole to observe so we can lay bare the numbers in order to ensure transparency and understanding.,96,,
441,0.97,2576.073,2591.555,And the final caution is that any one-time savings that is used or being proposed to be used in adjusting this year's budget shortfall will not be available to reduce next year's budget shortfall.,96,,
442,0.97,2591.555,2599.33,"And as we all know, future budget Sustainability questions have been raised by Ceo and others.",96,,
443,0.97,2599.33,2604.335,Next slide.,96,,
444,0.97,2604.335,2619.483,"So page 6. this slide is asking the question, what will this Council evaluate in suspense to the governor's balance package?",96,,
445,0.97,2619.483,2634.031,"A package that is Compliezed of eight ordinances and four resolutions for example where I sit, I believe the Kunl will want to look closely at a number of options which I have listed here.",96,,
446,0.97,2634.031,2640.904,That includes evaluating the proposed from levies to funds for day to day operations.,96,,
447,0.97,2640.904,2648.245,Which will conclude how much the city should draw for the fiscal return funds for this emergency.,96,,
448,0.97,2648.245,2657.354,And the Mayor is proposing to tap $29 million in 2020 to help balance the budget.,96,,
449,0.97,2657.354,2666.43,The other option is about how to allocate the $131.5 million Coronavirus relief fund that you see from the Federal Government.,96,,
450,0.97,2666.43,2674.838,As well as whether the Council wants to make any changes to the list of specific Department reductions.,96,,
451,0.97,2674.838,2691.755,These other one-time savings to decrease the budget deficit.,96,,
452,0.97,2696.56,2712.009,I'd also like to point out that the central staff's issue identification papers include issues that will warrant a close look by the Council.,96,,
453,0.97,2712.009,2716.48,These include a discussion warranted on issues related to race and social justice ramifications.,96,,
454,0.97,2716.48,2722.119,And finally we will have an opportunity to evaluate a resolution.,96,,
455,0.97,2722.119,2724.121,Included in the proposed balancing package.,96,,
456,0.97,2724.121,2729.193,One of the four resolutions.,96,,
457,0.97,2729.193,2738.702,That will have the city crafting or the Mayor crafting a proposed one-year budget rather than a two-year budget this coming fall.,96,,
458,0.97,2738.702,2743.44,"And as many of you know, in the odd years, the city likes a one-year budget.",96,,
459,0.97,2743.44,2752.75,"In the even years, as in the current 2020 year, the city likes a two-year budget.",96,,
460,0.97,2752.75,2760.657,"So on my final slide, I just want to check--chair Mosqueda sent a memo on Monday.",96,,
461,0.97,2760.657,2766.964,"In the as wells of time, I would remind you that there is an imminent deadline worth noting.",96,,
462,0.97,2766.964,2780.144,That is to submit amendment proposals to central staff by this Friday at 10:00 am.,96,,
463,0.97,2786.75,2791.688,"If there are no questions for me, I can hand the Mic over to Tom.",96,,
464,0.97,2791.688,2792.589,Thank you very much.,97,,
465,0.97,2792.589,2809.54,I will echo my appreciation for your entire team.,97,,
466,0.97,2820.35,2824.454,There will be time at the end for people to tee up possible Ma'Ams they're interested in.,97,,
467,0.97,2824.454,2827.124,You do not have to do that at this point.,97,,
468,0.97,2827.124,2837.0,"If you're still exploring ideas or have questions about thing, this is a great time to throw those out to your colleagues so they know what you're potentially thinking about.",97,,
469,0.97,2837.0,2847.01,But there will be ample time to talk about amendments next Wednesday and Thursday.,97,,
470,0.97,2847.01,2856.587,"This is issue identification to let folks know what possible issues you would be bringing to Council, but it is not necessarily All-Encompassing of the amendments Percolating.",97,,
471,0.97,2856.587,2867.064,We do have some time at the end for some Council members who have identified specific issue areas.,97,,
472,0.97,2867.364,2940.737,Happy to Nswer any questions as that also signals.,97,,
473,0.97,2940.737,2942.139,"Tom, without further Ado.",97,,
474,0.97,2942.139,2942.606,I'm sorry.,98,,
475,0.97,2942.606,2945.208,"I didn't see your hand, go ahead, please.",99,,
476,0.97,2945.208,2963.46,"I think it's very important to recognize that in the Powerpoint, where we're identifying current challenges, that there is a current challenge that is not recognized.",100,,
477,0.97,2963.46,2970.434,"And obviously it has great impacts on district 1, but it has impacts on other districts in the region as a whole.",100,,
478,0.97,2970.434,2978.575,And that is the economic impacts associated with the closure of the West Seattle bridge.,100,,
479,0.97,2978.575,2990.987,"And again, they're not only just global economic impacts about that citywide, but there's also impacts to our city's budget for 2020.",100,,
480,0.97,2990.987,3004.301,There is significant unanticipated spending associated with preparing for the decision to either rebuild or replace the existing bridge.,100,,
481,0.97,3004.301,3012.175,As well as significant funding demands associated with repairs that have to be made to the lower-level bridge.,100,,
482,0.97,3012.175,3014.811,Another $10 million necessary for just the lower level bridge.,100,,
483,0.97,3014.811,3026.523,And this is on top of the nearly $4 million of unanticipated spending that has been done this year.,100,,
484,0.97,3026.523,3026.923,Thank you.,100,,
485,0.97,3026.923,3027.257,Well-Said.,101,,
486,0.97,3027.257,3037.534,And thank you for highlighting that.,101,,
487,0.97,3037.534,3042.973,"If this were any other year, the West Seattle bridge would constantly be the headline.",101,,
488,0.97,3042.973,3043.44,Above the fold.,101,,
489,0.97,3043.44,3051.415,"But for all the other things that are happening, it is one of many issues that is compounding the crisis in front of us to address the budget.",101,,
490,0.97,3051.415,3054.317,"So thank you, council member Herbold for raising that.",101,,
491,0.97,3054.317,3054.918,"Tom, thank you so much.",101,,
492,0.97,3054.918,3059.456,We'll turn it over to you.,101,,

494,0.97,3061.858,3067.864,"Good afternoon, members of the select budget committee.",102,,
495,0.97,3067.864,3087.317,I am going to cover an overview of the city's general purpose fiscal Reserve.,102,,
496,0.97,3090.754,3093.623,Proposed amendment that is a funding conflict that is identified.,102,,
497,0.97,3093.623,3096.426,"Before you move on, I want to make sure.",103,,
498,0.97,3096.426,3099.196,Audio has been an issue in the past.,103,,
499,0.97,3099.196,3100.764,I can hear you well.,103,,
500,0.97,3100.764,3101.465,The Video is delayed.,103,,
501,0.97,3101.465,3102.966,But I can hear you well.,103,,
502,0.97,3102.966,3111.908,"I wanted to give a Thumbs-Up from other Council member fist they can hear him, members if they can hear him as well.",103,,
503,0.97,3111.908,3112.742,"Okay, please continue, Tom.",103,,
504,0.97,3112.742,3114.277,"Thank you, chair.",104,,
505,0.97,3114.277,3124.421,"If I can direct your attention to the first table on this slide before you, this is a representation of our key Reserve.",104,,
506,0.97,3124.421,3131.628,The emergency Fund and the revenue compensation Fund.,104,,
507,0.97,3131.628,3139.436,Emergency fund is established by resources for unanticipated emergency spending for things like unanticipated natural human disasters.,104,,

510,0.97,3151.448,3157.32,Or mandatory spending requirements that were incurred after the budget year adopted.,104,,

512,0.97,3174.838,3181.344,"Based on that policy, the record last fall funded the Reserve at a level of $66.9 million.",104,,
513,0.97,3181.344,3189.486,Which as you see on the table is 4.5% of the 2020 adopted budget expenditures.,104,,
514,0.97,3189.486,3199.996,"Moving to the governor's Rev my Fund, the next on the top table, this is a fund that was established to also preserve the rule of these forces.",104,,
515,0.97,3199.996,3213.21,"For activities that would otherwise be reduced in scope, suspended or eliminated due to unanticipated shortfalls in the general fund revenue.",104,,
516,0.97,3213.21,3220.617,Seattle municipal code limits the maximum annual dollar to 5% of certain forecasted general fund tax revenues.,104,,
517,0.97,3220.617,3226.389,The 2020 adopted budget funded that Reserve at a full level of $60.8 million.,104,,
518,0.97,3226.389,3233.63,Or 4% of General fund expenditures for the year.,104,,

521,0.97,3246.576,3252.549,That was submitted by the executives as part of the rebalancing package.,104,,
522,0.97,3252.549,3264.26,That proposal as Kirster mentioned in her opening remarks using $29 million from the combined Reserve as part of the rebalancing proposal for 2020.,104,,
523,0.97,3264.26,3271.935,It's worth noting that this uses the emergency funds for revenue backing.,104,,
524,0.97,3271.935,3277.474,Though the fund as I stated previously is technically for added emergency expenses.,104,,
525,0.97,3277.474,3288.585,"If we can move to the next slide, I'll discuss the event tax on the balances.",104,,
526,0.97,3288.585,3296.993,Both with the Mayor's Propsal and the Jump-Starspending proposal for Tweb 20.,104,,
527,0.97,3296.993,3299.396,For 2020.,104,,
528,0.97,3299.396,3304.801,"We have the 2020, the difference and the concept.",104,,
529,0.97,3304.801,3306.803,Starting from a budgeted balance.,104,,
530,0.97,3306.803,3309.906,Working through the Mayor's proposed uses.,104,,
531,0.97,3309.906,3315.011,And establishing a balanced level after the Mayor's proposal.,104,,
532,0.97,3315.011,3318.315,And then adding the Jump-Start proposal.,104,,
533,0.97,3318.315,3330.627,So we start with a combined balance of $127.7 million.,104,,
534,0.97,3330.627,3344.007,The Mayor's proposal uses approximately half of each fund to come up with a $29 million for balancing and that results in the total combined balance of $98.7 million.,104,,
535,0.97,3344.007,3356.152,"Then we Jump-Start to usage, come in with effectively $66.9 from the Fund, and $18.9 from the revenue stabilization fund.",104,,
536,0.97,3356.152,3358.355,A combined use of approximately $86 million.,104,,
537,0.97,3358.355,3364.227,"As you'll see the combined effect of these two proposals--Oh, there is a footnote here.",104,,
538,0.97,3364.227,3366.362,A very important footnote.,104,,
539,0.97,3366.362,3381.411,"Which notes that the proposal uses, though they are used in between 20 of these funds, the second plan which is also considered in Council bill 119811.",104,,
540,0.97,3381.411,3396.059,Would as a first order of business on the payroll expense tax first used in 2021 would replenish these uses as shown on this table.,104,,
541,0.97,3396.059,3403.5,The balance after the proposed usage would be Negative-29 million in both funds.,104,,
542,0.97,3403.5,3407.27,So if we can move to the next slide.,104,,
543,0.97,3407.27,3415.211,We have an option for essentially what would be a technical amendment to resolve this conflict.,104,,
544,0.97,3415.211,3423.853,So similar construction starting with a balance of $127.7 million.,104,,
545,0.97,3423.853,3437.1,With an amendment to the executive Council bill 119825 is put forward to take the entire amount of the $29 million proposed for 2020 from the revenue stabilization fund.,104,,
546,0.97,3437.1,3439.536,And that would essentially resolve the conflict.,104,,
547,0.97,3439.536,3455.885,The ending balance of the combined funds would be the same.,104,,
548,0.97,3459.923,3476.573,"The first order of business in 2021, to replenish he uses that are proposed for this year.",104,,
549,0.97,3476.573,3479.142,Sort of the middle of the table.,104,,
550,0.97,3479.142,3482.579,Of the proposal.,104,,
551,0.97,3482.579,3484.481,And I believe that is the extent of mine.,104,,
552,0.97,3484.481,3496.993,So I can turn this over to Jeff Sims.,104,,
553,0.97,3496.993,3497.293,Notorious,104,,
554,0.97,3497.293,3499.596,Were there any questions for Tom?,105,,
555,0.97,3499.596,3506.202,So Jeff gonNA cover the Covid-Related areas.,106,,
556,0.97,3506.202,3511.074,Radio Council member Herbold?,106,,
557,0.97,3511.074,3511.541,Question for Tom.,106,,
558,0.97,3511.541,3513.209,Thank you.,107,,
559,0.97,3513.209,3515.612,I feel like I've asked this question before.,107,,
560,0.97,3515.612,3519.315,I'm just having a hard time understanding that footnote on slide 10.,107,,
561,0.97,3519.315,3526.789,Where we say that we are going to be refurbishing the emergency funds in 2021 with the Jump-Start funds.,107,,
562,0.97,3526.789,3547.143,"If the Jump-Start funds are not gonNA be available until February of 2022, how are we going to use funds that we're not gonNA be receiving until 2022 to replenish emergency Sorries the two emergency funds in 2021?",107,,
563,0.97,3547.143,3555.852,Thank you for your question.,108,,
564,0.97,3555.852,3558.855,It's gonNA be a little bit of an accounting explanation.,108,,
565,0.97,3558.855,3570.867,"Technically when tax proceeds that are earned in a year, so in this case the cash supply will be the payroll expense tax, begins in fiscal year 2021.",108,,
566,0.97,3570.867,3581.878,All of those liabilities are then due with the final payment of 2021.,108,,
567,0.97,3581.878,3586.983,Ch is technically one month after the fiscal year as the legislation is written.,108,,
568,0.97,3586.983,3605.301,"Which would mean that when the accounting section of the Finance Department in FAS looks at the collections that come in in February of 2022, they will then accrue those moneys back into use for the 2021 budget.",108,,
569,0.97,3605.301,3615.812,So it's essentially a modified Acruel basis of accounting that makes those resources that are earned in 2021 available for use in 2021.,108,,
570,0.97,3615.812,3616.813,Thank you.,109,,
571,0.97,3616.813,3626.289,"And as you provide your explanation again it, occurs to me that I have indeed asked this question before.",109,,
572,0.97,3626.289,3629.726,And you've answered it.,109,,
573,0.97,3629.726,3637.533,Can I speak to any sort of uncertainty about this accounting exercise?,109,,
574,0.97,3637.533,3684.814,"If we are planning spend money in 20 21 or planning in this case on Replenishing the emergency Fund and revenue stabilization fund with this level of funds from the payroll tax, is what we decide to spend in the beginning of 2021 and what FAS is anticipating filling Stlshgs a good certainty that there will be, is there a good certainty that there will be a match between what we're billing for and what we're actually receiving in 2022?",109,,
575,0.97,3685.114,3686.482,Thank you for the question.,110,,
576,0.97,3686.482,3694.791,"It's essentially a matter of--it's similar to how we do with our current D, in O Tacks.",110,,
577,0.97,3694.791,3709.305,"It's the current structure that if there's capital activity that is happening and a payment that is made within a certain accounting window, then those moneys can be accounted for in the current year's budget.",110,,
578,0.97,3709.305,3728.524,To the extent that money from the payroll expense tax are budgeted in 2010 Stwon.,110,,
579,0.97,3728.524,3742.572,"Would be the guideline to determine how much of the--how much can, essentially, be deployed from the payroll expense tax with the first going toward the reinstitution funds.",110,,
580,0.97,3743.072,3743.973,Thank you.,111,,
581,0.97,3751.38,3756.052,Any additional questions for Tom?,112,,
582,0.97,3756.052,3757.386,Thank you for your presentation.,112,,
583,0.97,3757.386,3765.928,I'll turn it over to Jeff.,112,,
584,0.97,3765.928,3778.975,"Council member, you're aware of the $233 million in Covid-Related spending in the rebalancing budget.",113,,
585,0.97,3778.975,3780.076,Rebalancing package.,113,,
586,0.97,3780.076,3782.478,It's ran understandably complicated package to Digest.,113,,
587,0.97,3782.478,3790.92,Though it does have the elegance of covering everything that is included in the balancing package and related to Covid spending.,113,,
588,0.97,3790.92,3801.097,It is possible also to think about our Covid spending differently.,113,,
589,0.97,3801.097,3804.3,It covers the vast majority of the money.,113,,
590,0.97,3804.3,3809.071,There are several activities that will be on the next couple slides.,113,,
591,0.97,3809.071,3813.075,First first responders supports out of $40 million.,113,,
592,0.97,3813.075,3813.91,Food access programs.,113,,
593,0.97,3813.91,3817.113,"An array of delivery, a food bank or voucher.",113,,
594,0.97,3817.113,3820.716,Adding up to just a little bit more than $34 million.,113,,
595,0.97,3820.716,3826.923,Housing supports more than $16 million.,113,,
596,0.97,3826.923,3828.224,"Next slide, please.",113,,
597,0.97,3828.224,3830.56,"Rental assistance, just over $14 million.",113,,
598,0.97,3830.56,3838.134,Business and nonprofit support for $5 million.,113,,
599,0.97,3838.134,3846.442,Staffing for the emergency response Online which is $66.,113,,
600,0.97,3846.442,3851.714,Which is shown on line G are costs that are supporting the distributed items above it.,113,,
601,0.97,3851.714,3865.461,"You have staff in Seattle--in Seattle public utility, the libraries and parks, all of whom are supporting our hedging services that you would see.",113,,
602,0.97,3865.461,3870.366,The staff Repurposed for necessary Covid activities is shown in G.,113,,
603,0.97,3870.366,3873.369,Together that adds up $171 million.,113,,
604,0.97,3873.369,3878.341,Majority of the $233 million that the--is presented as the city spending on Covid so far.,113,,
605,0.97,3878.341,3887.783,"We go to the next slide, you'll see that the remaining amount, almost doll 62 million I've labeled as other activities.",113,,
606,0.97,3887.783,3899.095,These are necessary expenses related to Covid.,113,,
607,0.97,3899.095,3904.233,Those all add up to $50 Millio except for the other uses at the bottom.,113,,
608,0.97,3904.233,3907.803,Quickly we run through almost everything that is in this $233 million package.,113,,
609,0.97,3907.803,3916.612,But I think it's an easier approach to think about some of the Sdrooet activities that have been the authorities of the Council expressed at variety times already.,113,,
610,0.97,3916.612,3919.815,And there's also some underlying support functions that are necessary.,113,,
611,0.97,3919.815,3935.231,"I want to point also, emphasize, that the other uses, the $11.818 million, that's not a bucket of unspent funds.",113,,
612,0.97,3935.231,3936.899,That's actually discreet things.,113,,
613,0.97,3936.899,3938.534,Things that were associated with Street closures.,113,,
614,0.97,3938.534,3939.735,A lot of smaller amounts.,113,,
615,0.97,3939.735,3946.208,And they don't add up to the tens of millions of dollars level.,113,,
616,0.97,3946.208,3947.343,Overall that's our seven areas.,113,,
617,0.97,3947.343,3949.512,Let's move to the next slide.,113,,
618,0.97,3949.512,3957.954,"I want to highlight not only that there's $233 million if the balancing package, but also aware that there are some funding amounts that have not yet arrived to the city that will be coming.",113,,
619,0.97,3957.954,3961.257,They aren't all for use in 2020.,113,,
620,0.97,3961.257,3963.159,They all extend into future years.,113,,
621,0.97,3963.159,3969.765,That's going to be more than $37 million.,113,,
622,0.97,3969.765,3972.668,Emergency solutions grant ALLOCATES they'll be getting sometime soon.,113,,
623,0.97,3972.668,3977.673,It allows to us go estimated around September 30th of 2022.,113,,
624,0.97,3977.673,3983.346,"The usage there, mostly related to homelessness services.",113,,
625,0.97,3983.346,3988.884,"If they don't have the estimated all for that yet, but we do have an estimated Timeframe that those funds can be used.",113,,
626,0.97,3988.884,3990.953,And you can see the various uses.,113,,
627,0.97,3990.953,3997.393,The Council has actually already acted on our CGE and that is available already.,113,,
628,0.97,3997.393,4002.198,We'll also be receiving another grant from the Washington Department of Commerce.,113,,
629,0.97,4002.198,4007.269,Likely to be specific to shelter funds allocated by the state Legislature.,113,,
630,0.97,4007.269,4008.604,The final details are not highlighted.,113,,
631,0.97,4008.604,4010.973,There will be some funding streams coming down the line.,113,,
632,0.97,4010.973,4016.579,And a lot of these will be related to unnecessary expenses related to Covid.,113,,
633,0.97,4016.579,4026.722,"In the last line that I have for you, and I'll open up the questions, one policy issue that we wanted to highlight for your attention.",113,,
634,0.97,4026.722,4032.762,The proposed balancing package has some funds allocated within it that are for potential expenses.,113,,
635,0.97,4032.762,4036.198,You can see each of these lines in the table here.,113,,
636,0.97,4036.198,4042.705,The large evaluate of which is a little more than $15 million for FEMA and UN,113,,
637,0.97,4042.705,4045.408,I wanted costs.,114,,
638,0.97,4045.408,4046.442,Unanticipated costs.,114,,
639,0.97,4046.442,4050.813,That is essentially a little bit less than half of what is being submitted for potential reimbursement by FEMA.,114,,
640,0.97,4050.813,4053.149,As well as thinking about unanticipated coves.,114,,
641,0.97,4053.149,4061.357,"So it's thinking through if we submitted an expense to FEMA that was found not to be eligible for some reason, that will cover the expenses.",114,,
642,0.97,4061.357,4066.962,"And also as you all know, the Covid emergency pandemic continues to evolve in our country.",114,,
643,0.97,4066.962,4073.135,And there's a lot of unforeseen expenses that we might not be able to anticipate at this time.,114,,
644,0.97,4073.135,4076.272,There's also $10 million that are for reopening city services.,114,,
645,0.97,4076.272,4092.088,"The majority of that are characterized as purchases that will be related to hand San tire, Sanitizer, things like that that are necessary in response to the Covid crisis.",114,,
646,0.97,4092.088,4094.09,And things that are necessary to reopen the city.,114,,
647,0.97,4094.09,4099.728,And the last two items are things appropriated by the Council that are part of the package.,114,,
648,0.97,4099.728,4104.2,Presuming that the human emergency will not be extended all the way through the end of 2020.,114,,
649,0.97,4104.2,4119.682,So we'll need funds to support the Deintensification of our shelters and the hygiene services that have been made available.,114,,
650,0.97,4119.682,4124.487,Those are all expenses that have varying degrees of probability planning for things we think are likely.,114,,
651,0.97,4124.487,4127.089,But there is a possibility the circumstances could change.,114,,
652,0.97,4127.089,4130.693,"Based on, for example, the FEMA emergency extended through the end of the year.",114,,
653,0.97,4130.693,4139.034,That will reflect those last two lines on how much was necessary in order to maintain our shelters and hygiene services.,114,,
654,0.97,4139.034,4148.144,"So there's a policy there for the Council to think about, thinking about the needs that are present Ight now, compared to the needs you think might be needed in the coming minutes.",114,,
655,0.97,4148.144,4155.384,And that's actually all of my summary for the Covid-Related spending but I will foster any questions.,114,,
656,0.97,4155.384,4155.718,Wonderful.,115,,
657,0.97,4155.718,4164.159,"Council, any questions for Jeff on this portion of the agenda?",115,,
658,0.97,4164.159,4166.061,I am not seeing any questions.,115,,
659,0.97,4166.061,4173.502,I know there's a handful of possible amendments that folks have begun to tee up for the 2020 rebalancing package.,115,,
660,0.97,4173.502,4177.039,Perhaps there'll be questions later.,115,,
661,0.97,4177.039,4179.275,"Council member Herbold, please go ahead.",115,,
662,0.97,4179.275,4193.289,"As it relates to the $11 million that we have not yet received, in the joint application with King County, this is $11 million the all the city is applying for set to receive?",116,,
663,0.97,4193.289,4196.392,Or is the $11 million anticipated to be split with King County?,116,,
664,0.97,4196.392,4199.762,"And if it is, what's the prediction for how much would come to the county?",116,,
665,0.97,4199.762,4204.9,I believe the $11 million is the amount that would arrive to Seattle.,117,,
666,0.97,4204.9,4206.635,"But as you noted, it's a join application.",117,,
667,0.97,4206.635,4220.015,"In order to receive that $11 million, a condition is that we have a joint application with the county that discusses various uses and that's the only way we can go forward.",117,,
668,0.97,4220.015,4220.349,Thank you.,118,,
669,0.97,4220.349,4224.486,Any additional questions?,119,,
670,0.97,4224.486,4225.02,"Okay, Jeff.",119,,
671,0.97,4225.087,4226.689,Hanks again for your presentation.,119,,
672,0.97,4226.689,4227.59,We really appreciate it.,119,,
673,0.97,4227.59,4231.594,And we're moving understood the SPD budget.,119,,
674,0.97,4231.594,4246.442,Thanks again to Greg Groff for all of his work and central staff for leading the detailed questions and analysis for us.,119,,
675,0.97,4246.442,4249.445,We do have a community presentation as well.,119,,
676,0.97,4249.445,4250.246,"Thank you, Madame.",120,,
677,0.97,4250.246,4252.114,Chair and members of the committee.,120,,
678,0.97,4252.114,4259.355,I'm here today to talk with you about the reductions that the executive is proposing to make in the 2020 Rebalance budget.,120,,
679,0.97,4259.355,4279.274,"I don't anticipate a very long presentation today many of you are familiar with the proposed reductions, and I know there is interest in moving beyond t reductions.",120,,
680,0.97,4279.274,4285.28,The rebalancing budget would decrease or reduce the expenditures by $20.3 million.,120,,
681,0.97,4285.28,4292.588,And that equates to a 5% annual reduction or 10% reduction if you're calculating for the last six months of 2020.,120,,
682,0.97,4292.588,4296.692,The executive proposes to make these reductions administratively.,120,,
683,0.97,4296.692,4311.507,"So that's important because if the Council wants to ensure these Rucks are made legally, they would need to include them in the appropriations bill for the Rebalanced budget.",120,,
684,0.97,4311.507,4319.214,"Otherwise the exec will just make the Rucks themselves wonderful, that I'm just gonNA go ahead and take these various categories at a high clip.",120,,
685,0.97,4319.214,4324.486,Reducing travel and training expenses.,120,,
686,0.97,4324.486,4329.692,Spd as qualified for its own level of duration and training for the duration of the Covid emergency.,120,,
687,0.97,4329.692,4339.535,All internal and external In-Person training has been restricted to those that are required for Certifications or for building skills to perform basic job functions.,120,,
688,0.97,4339.535,4350.546,"The 597,000 that you see that's being reduced here is a little bit more than half of the entire travel and training budget for the Department.",120,,
689,0.97,4350.546,4354.216,The asked the Department to give me updated figures on what is left in travels and training.,120,,
690,0.97,4354.216,4357.619,And I should be able to get that for you sometime soon.,120,,
691,0.97,4357.619,4360.856,"Moving to the next category, civilian hiring.",120,,
692,0.97,4360.856,4368.897,"As you know, there is a citywide hiring freeze.",120,,
693,0.97,4368.897,4371.266,Just a couple things to note here.,120,,
694,0.97,4371.266,4377.673,"Because of recent departures, there is one victim advocate position that is vacant.",120,,
695,0.97,4377.673,4381.443,One crime prevention coordinator position that is vacant.,120,,
696,0.97,4381.443,4386.648,And two community service officer positions that have yet to be hired.,120,,
697,0.97,4386.648,4388.083,Both those have received waivers.,120,,
698,0.97,4388.083,4397.793,And I bring those to your attention because those are typically public safety positions Tha Council is interested in hearing about.,120,,
699,0.97,4397.793,4400.362,The next enemy I'll talk about is overtime expenses.,120,,
700,0.97,4400.362,4406.101,"As you can see, the reduction here is about $8.6 million.",120,,
701,0.97,4406.101,4412.708,This is coming as a result of SPD reducing its patrol expenditures.,120,,
702,0.97,4412.708,4416.879,Its staffing of special events and sports.,120,,
703,0.97,4416.879,4420.949,Its reduced overtime expenditures on trapping and park enforcement.,120,,
704,0.97,4420.949,4422.651,Human engagement.,120,,
705,0.97,4422.651,4431.994,All the various kinds of activities that are currently suffering from a lack of demand related to Covid.,120,,
706,0.97,4431.994,4439.435,So SPD indicates that it plans to wrap up the force as the plans for the serves renewed.,120,,
707,0.97,4439.435,4450.179,"One of the issues I wanted to point out to you today, it would be difficult for the Department to do this as they have recently indicated to me that their entire overtime budget is now depleted.",120,,
708,0.97,4450.179,4456.151,"As many of you know, the department had a $30 million overtime budget at the beginning of the year.",120,,
709,0.97,4456.151,4474.736,"The proposed reduction of $8.6 million along with a need to fund the demonstration costs of--I'm sorry, the reduction of $8.6, along with the need to fund the demonstration costs of $6.3 have eliminated just about half of the overtime budget.",120,,
710,0.97,4474.736,4485.547,"And SPD has respected that the other half has been sent to activities such as training, shift extensions and other internal functions.",120,,
711,0.97,4485.547,4494.489,"From this point forward, SPD is going to need to find overtime by reducing other areas of their budget.",120,,
712,0.97,4494.489,4501.163,They have indicated they are working on potential solutions to this problem but have not yet developed any strategies that they can share with us.,120,,
713,0.97,4501.163,4530.525,"Given the situation, it's not surprising that SPD is no longer able to conduct the $848,000 emphasis patrols that the city added to the budget in the 2020 cycle.",120,,
714,0.97,4540.602,4545.14,Since overtime budget is not going to be available for those Patroels.,120,,
715,0.97,4545.14,4546.842,"Moving along, equipment savings.",120,,
716,0.97,4546.842,4549.545,Equipment savings is about $2 million.,120,,
717,0.97,4549.545,4555.584,Spd has restricted all purchases to only those items that are essential for the Covid response.,120,,
718,0.97,4555.584,4564.226,"As long as the reductions are temporary and assumed only for 2020, then those purchases can likely be pushed into 2021.",120,,
719,0.97,4564.226,4568.363,And there shouldn't be significant operational impacts.,120,,
720,0.97,4568.363,4581.843,One thing that is notable is that there is a proposed one-year delay of the Computer-Aided dispatch project that was funded in the 2020 budget.,120,,
721,0.97,4581.843,4602.431,"The savings associated with that project and its delay are not captured in the $2 million but, rather, are Repurposed in the budget.",120,,
722,0.97,4603.565,4609.037,Reenvisioning police services work that the Mayor has indicated is going to be underway soon about.,120,,
723,0.97,4609.037,4615.31,"$800,000 is going to be used to extend the life of the current cab system.",120,,
724,0.97,4615.31,4620.983,And $1.4 million is going to be used to hire police Dispatchers during the city hiring freeze.,120,,
725,0.97,4620.983,4627.022,The next item is really more of a technical correction.,120,,
726,0.97,4627.022,4631.326,It is reducing sworn wages to reflect Spiu Actuals.,120,,
727,0.97,4631.326,4640.535,The Seattle police officers Guild contract required a wage increase in 2020 that was based on the CPI at the time that the budget was written.,120,,
728,0.97,4640.535,4643.438,The CPI was 4.1%.,120,,
729,0.97,4643.438,4645.04,It is now 2.7%.,120,,
730,0.97,4645.04,4651.246,That is going to save the city $3.1 million.,120,,
731,0.97,4651.246,4653.849,The planning for the North precinct has been put on hold.,120,,
732,0.97,4653.849,4656.652,And that is also part of the $20 million about.,120,,
733,0.97,4656.652,4681.576,"You that savings is actually in, Iffa, S. to fund $7,500 hiring bone us for new recruits and $15,000 hiring bonuses for lateral transfer hires.",120,,
734,0.97,4681.576,4691.253,"When receiving the hiring bonus, a new recruit or officer receives half of the bonus upon hire and the remaining half a year later.",120,,
735,0.97,4691.253,4698.894,"Spd has indicated that it has sent $614,000 of original ad.",120,,
736,0.97,4698.894,4714.476,Their plan is to--the city budget office plans to let that amount lapse and Reappropriate it in the proposed budget to cover the remaining obligations for the recruits who have yet to receive the second half of their bonus.,120,,
737,0.97,4714.476,4726.188,And finally Council added $1.2 million to the 2020 adopted budget to fund recommendations outlined in the Mayor's recruitment and retention report.,120,,
738,0.97,4726.188,4728.457,Spd has put that project on hold.,120,,
739,0.97,4728.457,4737.933,And the quarters that were funded by that initiative are currently working on Covid-Related activities.,120,,
740,0.97,4737.933,4743.338,The department indicated that it has spent about half of the $1.2 million for that project.,120,,
741,0.97,4743.338,4745.841,And that's going to summarize my presentation.,120,,
742,0.97,4745.841,4754.85,The next slide was simply the approximately issues that I just brought to your attention as I was running through the reductions.,120,,
743,0.97,4754.85,4755.283,Open for questions.,120,,
744,0.97,4755.283,4756.418,Thank you very much.,121,,
745,0.97,4756.418,4761.022,"Council member Lewis, Strauss, and Herbold.",121,,
746,0.97,4761.022,4767.429,"Thank you so much, Madame chair.",122,,
747,0.97,4767.429,4767.629,Greg.,122,,
748,0.97,4767.629,4786.281,Thanks for all your work on these issues surrounding the police Department in the past couple weeks.,122,,
749,0.97,4788.75,4807.602,Does of this $20 million require some form of bargaining before this savings could be locked in or could where these things are being drawn from be immediately applied to filling in our budget Shorefall?,122,,
750,0.97,4807.602,4813.475,I think that the city budget office is planning on using this $20 million during the budget shortfall.,123,,
751,0.97,4813.475,4818.914,"Because we're talking about a lack of work in these areas, I don't believe any of them are going to require bargaining.",123,,
752,0.97,4818.914,4819.147,Gray.,124,,
753,0.97,4819.147,4823.485,Just wanted to clarify Thatch that's it.,124,,
754,0.97,4823.485,4825.787,Thank you.,125,,
755,0.97,4825.787,4826.321,Council member Lewis.,125,,
756,0.97,4826.321,4828.19,Council member Strauss.,125,,
757,0.97,4828.19,4830.258,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",126,,
758,0.97,4830.258,4846.608,"Thank you, Greg for all of your analysis inform response to the Mayor's proposals this week of the items we had in committee last week, how much of the Prepsal from Monday is included in this 2020 rebalancing?",126,,
759,0.97,4846.608,4849.544,Nothing.,127,,
760,0.97,4849.544,4851.413,Okay.,128,,
761,0.97,4851.413,4877.405,The 2020 Rebalance proposal they just presented to you is a proposal that was brought to the Council prior to the Mayor developing the proposal that she talked about in the press Rey lease.,129,,
762,0.97,4878.607,4880.942,Is that all for 2021?,130,,
763,0.97,4880.942,4892.754,It's my understanding that the Mayor is going to work on proposing some of those Reorders in the 2021 budget.,131,,
764,0.97,4892.754,4897.993,I do not expect she is going to propose those for the 2020 Rebalance in the next couple weeks.,131,,
765,0.97,4897.993,4898.894,Thank you.,132,,
766,0.97,4898.894,4904.899,"Council members, not to say that the Counciling not choose to do that.",133,,
767,0.97,4904.899,4905.233,Themselves.,133,,
768,0.97,4905.233,4905.5,Great.,134,,
769,0.97,4905.5,4919.914,"And just--now that we're on this line, what would the implication of using the 9-1-1 call center out of SPD in the 2020 Rebalance, what would the implication of that be?",134,,
770,0.97,4919.914,4930.158,That's something that I think I' want central staff to give some thought to and talk with you about.,135,,
771,0.97,4930.158,4943.939,"There is, of course the logistics of how that would happen in legislation.",135,,
772,0.97,4943.939,4949.01,That is something that would probably take some planning.,135,,
773,0.97,4949.01,4950.245,Thank you.,136,,
774,0.97,4950.245,4951.346,Wonderful.,137,,
775,0.97,4951.346,4955.283,"I see Council member Herbold, and Council member Sawant.",137,,
776,0.97,4957.585,4958.586,You are on mute still.,138,,
777,0.97,4958.586,4960.622,"Yes, I am, thank you.",139,,
778,0.97,4960.622,4961.323,Thank you.,140,,
779,0.97,4961.323,4977.872,My first question I single related to the line of questioning that Council member Strauss was making.,141,,
780,0.97,4977.872,4989.05,Are you saying none of it has been programmed for 2020 spending at this point?,141,,
781,0.97,4989.05,5011.172,"It has been in the balancing packages that you heard about from director noble, the $20.3 million that is reduced by SPD is associated as part of his general fund balancing scenario.",142,,
782,0.97,5011.172,5013.808,We have not received a bill.,142,,
783,0.97,5013.808,5018.646,It's just changes flat Department plans to make in the general fund to match expenditures.,142,,
784,0.97,5018.646,5045.874,"If we wanted to program that $23 million into violence prevention, investment in black and Brown community, we would have to find another $23 million?",143,,
785,0.97,5045.874,5047.909,I think that's a fair assessment.,144,,
786,0.97,5047.909,5068.096,"I would like to get more detail about how it is that seven months into the year, SPD has used all of the 2020 overtime budget of $30 million.",145,,
787,0.97,5070.932,5083.044,And the $6 million in expenses associated with overtime.,145,,
788,0.97,5083.044,5109.571,"But we knew very early in the year that SPD because of a reduction in crime, SPD had stopped doing emphasis patrol patrols.",145,,
789,0.97,5110.738,5117.612,In the areas that were initially referred to as emphasis areas.,145,,
790,0.97,5117.612,5118.913,Focused on use of overtime.,145,,
791,0.97,5118.913,5120.181,Not the focus on an area.,145,,
792,0.97,5120.181,5125.22,But specifically the use of overtime.,145,,
793,0.97,5125.22,5129.224,"Early in the year, they're like Oh, we don't need to use overtime.",145,,
794,0.97,5129.224,5132.527,So we can just use our regular patrol instead of using overtime.,145,,
795,0.97,5132.527,5135.43,Another huge part of the overtime budget is events.,145,,
796,0.97,5135.43,5137.532,Events that aren't happening right now.,145,,
797,0.97,5137.532,5149.644,So I'm just really at a loss.,145,,
798,0.97,5149.644,5162.557,"How $30 million of overtime for the whole year, we're in June, and $22 million or $14 million.",145,,
799,0.97,5162.557,5165.393,Has been used in overtime.,145,,
800,0.97,5165.393,5169.964,I'd like to get more detail about that.,145,,
801,0.97,5169.964,5185.38,"And Lastly, I just want to flag that there are categories in the budget that we are able as a Council to cut or add to that level of detail.",145,,
802,0.97,5185.38,5192.987,So some categories that were formerly a separate line item are now part of a broader funding pool.,145,,
803,0.97,5192.987,5205.099,"So now there's a broad funding pool called criminal investigations that includes several separate line items, for instance narcotics and special items.",145,,
804,0.97,5205.099,5206.0,Special victims.,145,,
805,0.97,5206.0,5225.286,And I think it might make it difficult for the Council to cut within that broader budget item.,145,,
806,0.97,5225.753,5227.121,Victim advocacy.,145,,
807,0.97,5227.121,5237.031,"Intr are interested in us helping them moving those functions out of SPD, and into Community-Based organizations providing those same kind of services.",145,,
808,0.97,5237.031,5246.04,"And I'm just concerned that it's part of a broader funding pool, it might make that more difficult.",145,,
809,0.97,5246.04,5250.845,And I don't know if we need to go back to the previous level of detail that we had had in prior years.,145,,
810,0.97,5250.845,5257.185,Or if there's a way to accomplish what I'm describing through B providers.,145,,
811,0.97,5257.185,5266.16,Thank you.,145,,
812,0.97,5266.16,5270.865,"Council member, first of all, you're absolutely right.",146,,
813,0.97,5270.865,5275.87,Events and emphasis Patrels are two very large categories.,146,,
814,0.97,5275.87,5282.81,About $6.8 million were budgeted for events and about $2.2 million are budgeted for emphasis Patroels.,146,,
815,0.97,5282.81,5287.682,But there are other areas that have large allocations.,146,,
816,0.97,5287.682,5292.02,Professional standards when it comes to training is just under $4 million.,146,,
817,0.97,5292.02,5297.258,Criminal investigation is about $3.4 million in the budget.,146,,
818,0.97,5297.258,5314.175,Stirl though you have a point still though you have a point that extend tours in area outside of events and outside of emphasis Patroels obviously were significant if we got to a point as a city where the overtime budget is really extended.,146,,
819,0.97,5314.175,5317.512,So I will get more information about how that happened.,146,,
820,0.97,5317.512,5330.024,"And regarding your second point, I think what we're talking about here is appropriation.",146,,
821,0.97,5330.024,5331.025,What we call Bso.,146,,
822,0.97,5331.025,5333.494,Or the appropriation level that is in the budget.,146,,
823,0.97,5333.494,5346.908,And it is true that last year SPD and the executive Aggregated some of those appropriations into larger appropriations.,146,,
824,0.97,5346.908,5350.945,"For instance, each precinct used to have its own appropriation.",146,,
825,0.97,5350.945,5352.146,All five of them did.,146,,
826,0.97,5352.146,5358.186,And all those were Agcombated under a control ops appropriation.,146,,
827,0.97,5358.186,5368.629,That is something that we can pursue if it would allow the Council a greater level of control if those appropriations were broken out again.,146,,
828,0.97,5368.629,5371.866,Thank you.,147,,
829,0.97,5371.866,5373.935,I see Council member Sawan.,148,,
830,0.97,5373.935,5378.673,And then Council member Lewis.,148,,
831,0.97,5378.673,5379.674,Thank you.,149,,
832,0.97,5379.674,5391.085,I just wanted to make sure I heard critical that the Seattle police have spent half their allocated hiring bonuses.,149,,
833,0.97,5391.085,5399.16,"And assuming that's correct, I just wanted to point out, this is happening at the same time that other departments have been given a hiring freeze.",149,,
834,0.97,5399.16,5420.214,"And just to point out as I pointed out before, the office of civil rights and the office of labor standards do extremely important work that have the opposite effect, which is a Prthivesque, on the marginalized communities that are facing a negative impact on policing and excessive use of force.",149,,
835,0.97,5420.214,5432.627,"That's had a positive knack for our marginalized communities, and the staff are doing excellent work in the civil rights and labor standards officers are facing hiring freezes.",149,,
836,0.97,5432.627,5435.563,But the police Department has already spent half their hiring bonuses.,149,,
837,0.97,5435.563,5448.176,"So in other words not only did they continue hiring, they continued quote Unquote attracting applicants with additional hiring bonuses.",149,,
838,0.97,5448.176,5458.019,And I should mention that the kind of movement and uprising that we're seeing and we have seen over the last month or so is extremely important.,149,,
839,0.97,5458.019,5466.561,"Because many of the Council members who are now talking about Defunding SPD, which is very person, but this is coming from the pressure from the movement.",149,,
840,0.97,5466.561,5470.331,"Because just last year, there was a vote on the hiring bonuses.",149,,
841,0.97,5470.331,5473.935,And Unfortunately my office of the only No-Vote on the hiring bonuses.,149,,
842,0.97,5473.935,5479.674,Both the Council and the Mayor's office championed those hiring bonuses.,149,,
843,0.97,5479.674,5484.679,Which is extremely important at that time.,149,,
844,0.97,5484.679,5492.086,And I still say in hiring bonuses for social workers and educators and people who are doing important work in our community.,149,,
845,0.97,5492.086,5498.493,So we're talking about police officers having made outrageous amounts of overtime.,149,,
846,0.97,5498.493,5509.904,"And as anybody said, it Correlates the officers who have had the maximum amount of money to overtime and so on.",149,,
847,0.97,5509.904,5513.774,And also they're Collating a track record of violence and lack of accountability.,149,,
848,0.97,5513.774,5521.482,So overall also I think it's important to challenge the Mayor here.,149,,
849,0.97,5521.482,5526.153,Because she has claimed that she put $70 million in Seattle police.,149,,
850,0.97,5526.153,5531.092,That is without put anything writing in her budget because it is told that it will be done administratively.,149,,
851,0.97,5531.092,5534.629,Now they have used all of their overtime budget in the first half of the year.,149,,
852,0.97,5534.629,5544.238,"But we are supposed to believe that the police Department does not use anymore overtime, anymore of that.",149,,
853,0.97,5544.238,5548.943,"In addition to that, we have the report from noble from the weeks ago.",149,,
854,0.97,5548.943,5558.352,"The outrageous, unbelievable number, actually, of having spent over $6 million on just policing the George Floyd protests.",149,,
855,0.97,5558.352,5559.453,Just one month?,149,,
856,0.97,5559.453,5566.46,It's unbelievable what we're--what else would you do with over $6 million?,149,,
857,0.97,5566.46,5570.831,I just wanted to say--I will come back on this later in the discussion today.,149,,
858,0.97,5570.831,5574.569,And also in the upcoming discussions that we'll be moving the amendment.,149,,
859,0.97,5574.569,5594.355,"But just to say that my office alongside the people will be, of course, bringing a proviso on the--to prohibit the police orders from using any funds to prosecute the Blm protestors.",149,,
860,0.97,5594.355,5602.863,"We also want to tap Seattle police and city executive salaries at no more than $150,000 a year.",149,,
861,0.97,5602.863,5606.5,"I'm just sharing numbers with the public, they have brought this Ma'am.",149,,
862,0.97,5606.5,5606.968,Every year.,149,,
863,0.97,5606.968,5610.871,And Unfortunately the Council has not supported it.,149,,
864,0.97,5610.871,5624.018,But we also obviously want to fulfill what the community has been demanding which is immediately cutting the remainder of this year's Seattle police budget by 50%.,149,,
865,0.97,5624.018,5630.725,Which would be an estimated $85 million.,149,,
866,0.97,5630.725,5643.337,"And also ending their domestically named team and stop the inhumane ineffective police of our homeless neighbors Hampion again homelessness, we are people of color are disproportionately represented.",149,,
867,0.97,5643.337,5648.943,So many of these changes and additional changes I support from other Council members bringing them forward.,149,,
868,0.97,5648.943,5667.728,But I wanted to highlight the stark contrast between the budget cuts that other departments that are doing vital work for our community are facing compared to the quite outrageous practices that we're observing from the Seattle police.,149,,
869,0.97,5667.728,5673.768,"I probably should clarify at least one thing, council member.",150,,
870,0.97,5673.768,5678.439,Spd currently is under a hiring freeze for sworn and has been for a while.,150,,
871,0.97,5678.439,5684.045,They hired earlier this year quite a few recruits.,150,,
872,0.97,5684.045,5693.621,And just about half of their quota they hired in the early part of this year before the hiring freeze went into effect.,150,,
873,0.97,5693.621,5697.658,So that's what's driving the spending on the recruit bonuses.,150,,
874,0.97,5697.658,5701.729,They're not currently handing out recruit bonuses.,150,,
875,0.97,5701.729,5702.997,They're not currently hiring.,150,,
876,0.97,5702.997,5709.27,"As it turns out, they're out of money and they cannot hire any sworn at this point.",150,,
877,0.97,5709.27,5716.477,And I should also point that the hiring bonuses go back last year.,150,,
878,0.97,5716.477,5724.552,So they have been--the hiring bonuses have been handed out last year and through the early part of this year.,150,,
879,0.97,5724.552,5727.588,So sorry if I--information I probably should have mentioned earlier.,150,,
880,0.97,5727.588,5730.391,"Just to follow up on that, thank you.",151,,
881,0.97,5730.391,5732.326,I wasn't complete about any of that.,151,,
882,0.97,5732.326,5736.43,But I appreciate you clarifying all of that.,151,,
883,0.97,5736.43,5745.005,"I will NOTE as you have also noted, that yes, I was referring to the vote on the early bonuses from last year.",151,,
884,0.97,5745.005,5759.12,"And I'm not implying that they did it--used the hiring bonuses just now after the pandemic hit, but my point that is, as I have said, at that time, I was the only No-Vote on it.",151,,
885,0.97,5759.12,5767.161,"It is outrageous that the city Council and the Mayors, Mayor's office--we shouldn't need the George Floyd protestors to do the right thing.",151,,
886,0.97,5767.161,5771.332,And it was not the right thing to have hiring Bonuse police officers.,151,,
887,0.97,5771.332,5780.674,"At the same time especially when those who are doing important work in our community, especially social workers are so grossly underpaid.",151,,
888,0.97,5780.674,5782.376,They're chronically underpaid.,151,,
889,0.97,5782.376,5791.352,"And just to clarify, my understanding from my staff is that they continued hiring after the hiring freeze went into effect.",151,,
890,0.97,5791.352,5793.387,And they just stopped initiating recruitment classes.,151,,
891,0.97,5793.387,5794.788,Can you clarify on that?,151,,
892,0.97,5794.788,5795.189,"Thank you, Greg.",151,,
893,0.97,5795.189,5797.792,In advance.,151,,
894,0.97,5797.792,5806.901,"I think when the hiring freeze initially took hold, it probably exempted first responders.",152,,
895,0.97,5806.901,5812.606,So I think that there may have been sometime there where SPD was still hiring.,152,,
896,0.97,5812.606,5821.148,"And then it's the fiscal reality of the Covid crisis, and the fiscal reality that SPD hit, that was the point that they stopped hiring.",152,,
897,0.97,5821.148,5821.382,Okay.,153,,
898,0.97,5821.382,5822.283,Thank you so much.,153,,
899,0.97,5822.283,5829.123,"We have Council member Lewis, council member Morales, then we're gonNA close with the safety chair, council member Herbold.",153,,
900,0.97,5829.123,5843.737,Then I'm gonNA ask folks if they have additional questions on the SPD budget that they hold them for the end of our community panel presentation which is in part a response to the issue identification waiting for us to Idenify possible strategies moving forward.,153,,
901,0.97,5843.737,5844.205,Council member Lewis?,153,,
902,0.97,5844.205,5846.707,You are next.,153,,
903,0.97,5846.707,5847.741,Thank you.,154,,
904,0.97,5847.741,5856.55,"I just want to clarify real quick, I think you mentioned during your presentation.",154,,
905,0.97,5856.55,5858.752,But I just want to nail this down.,154,,
906,0.97,5858.752,5867.761,"In addition to the $20 million in the administrative savings, there are additional reductions in deferring the cabin limitation.",154,,
907,0.97,5867.761,5871.432,And that that is going toward the Revisioning process.,154,,
908,0.97,5871.432,5875.936,I wonder if you could just provide that breakdown again real quick.,154,,
909,0.97,5875.936,5879.24,"My understanding is that that is in addition to the $20 million, yes?",154,,
910,0.97,5879.24,5881.075,I just want to make sure.,154,,
911,0.97,5881.075,5884.245,"Yeah, that is outside of the $20 million.",155,,
912,0.97,5884.245,5889.884,This is money that SPD has identified and Repurposed in their own budget.,155,,
913,0.97,5889.884,5909.503,And so that Maument is half a million dollars occupant is half a million dollars that is going to be Reprogrammed for the police Reenvisioning process.,155,,
914,0.97,5909.503,5915.209,$1.4 million that will fund the hiring of police Dispatchers during the Hydration freeze.,155,,
915,0.97,5915.209,5916.61,Okay.,156,,
916,0.97,5916.61,5917.511,Thumbs-Up from Council member Lewis.,156,,
917,0.97,5917.511,5919.813,Thank you for answering that question.,156,,
918,0.97,5919.813,5922.316,"Council member Morales, did I see you wave?",156,,
919,0.97,5922.316,5922.516,Okay.,156,,
920,0.97,5922.516,5924.451,You're gonNA hold your question for later?,156,,
921,0.97,5924.451,5925.92,"No, I have a question.",157,,
922,0.97,5925.92,5926.253,"Oh, good.",158,,
923,0.97,5926.253,5927.554,Please go ahead.,158,,
924,0.97,5927.554,5931.325,It'll be quick.,159,,
925,0.97,5931.325,5940.768,First is I want to know what it means to set aside money to hire during a hiring freeze for these police inspectors.,159,,
926,0.97,5940.768,5954.615,But my ask is if we can see that Timeline of when the continued hiring and hiring bonuses went out.,159,,
927,0.97,5954.615,5959.053,And when the overtime was spent.,159,,
928,0.97,5959.053,5976.47,"Because I am doing a lot of questions about how operations continue to happen when the rest of our city staff, city workers were asked to implement a hiring freeze and to start reducing costs.",159,,
929,0.97,5976.47,5977.137,I'll stop there.,159,,
930,0.97,5977.137,5981.709,And let us proceed to the next segment.,159,,
931,0.97,5981.709,5987.481,"Should be pretty easy for me to get to you, council member.",160,,
932,0.97,5987.481,5991.185,They tried to ask for those details.,160,,
933,0.97,5991.185,5991.719,Those things.,160,,
934,0.97,5991.719,5992.186,"Okay, great.",161,,
935,0.97,5992.186,5994.288,And Council member Herbold.,161,,
936,0.97,5994.288,5996.39,"Oh, sorry, council member, Herbold.",161,,
937,0.97,5996.39,5997.191,The mute button.,161,,
938,0.97,5997.191,6018.045,"As it relates to the SPD hiring freeze as opposed to the city-wide hiring freeze that, first responders were exempt from, I remember from the last June staffing report we saw that there were about 40 officers that were still in training.",162,,
939,0.97,6018.045,6021.582,Are they considered hired when they are in training?,162,,
940,0.97,6021.582,6025.285,That's my first question.,162,,
941,0.97,6025.285,6034.428,And my second question is related to the hiring Bennus.,162,,
942,0.97,6034.428,6038.732,Do you view hiring bonuses as an employment benefit?,162,,
943,0.97,6038.732,6059.019,"And I'm wondering, just like many employment benefits when you agree to take a job in exchange for a certain menu of benefits, there's a reasonable expectation that you are going to be receiving all the benefits.",162,,
944,0.97,6059.019,6087.381,"But sometimes circumstances change after you're hired, similar to the conversations about Awi's that were Neshted in the contracts of negotiated in the contracts of other city labor Yiens in the city that we are now going to be reconsidering.",162,,
945,0.97,6087.381,6092.052,Is there a way to consider the hiring Ponuses of these officers?,162,,
946,0.97,6092.052,6094.855,I know that might be something that would have to be bargain.,162,,
947,0.97,6094.855,6107.901,"But beyond it being a benefit of employment, what are our obligations to fulfill that Xhiment to pay that second half of the bonus?",162,,
948,0.97,6107.901,6109.97,"The first one really, yes.",163,,
949,0.97,6109.97,6111.572,"When they're in training, they're hired.",163,,
950,0.97,6111.572,6116.51,They hire them before they start training.,163,,
951,0.97,6116.51,6122.049,And then put them in sort of Pretraining.,163,,
952,0.97,6122.049,6126.52,So yes.,163,,
953,0.97,6126.52,6128.889,And I'll have to get to law on your second question.,163,,
954,0.97,6128.889,6129.223,Thank you.,164,,
955,0.97,6129.223,6131.725,"Greg, I want to thank you for this overview.",165,,
956,0.97,6131.725,6149.143,I know you along with Jeff and Tom will be on the lines.,165,,
957,0.97,6149.143,6156.283,"In the same vein of the questions just being asked, Greg from the SPD's inquest or budget overview.",165,,
958,0.97,6156.283,6158.252,We do have four community partners here with us.,165,,
959,0.97,6158.252,6159.419,And I'm thankful for their time.,165,,
960,0.97,6159.419,6175.002,I know they are on the line here.,165,,
961,0.97,6185.946,6190.784,So many across our country.,165,,

969,0.97,6275.569,6295.055,"Many of the organizations that have been presenting to us today and in the past, and the folks calling in and asking for the changes requested in the document we'll review today have been doing so in the community for year.",166,,
970,0.97,6299.559,6307.801,"I really appreciate all of their time, and the way that they continue to identify these changes that we need.",166,,
971,0.97,6307.801,6312.005,Not just individual behavior changes but true systems change.,166,,
972,0.97,6312.005,6319.246,And institutional changes that we need to realize the public safety that so many in our community are asked to change.,166,,
973,0.97,6319.246,6331.425,"As we continue to have this conversation, most important we want to center it on the fact that many people have said that they don't currently feel safe.",166,,
974,0.97,6331.425,6332.993,It's essential that every community member feel safe.,166,,
975,0.97,6332.993,6342.736,We want to make sure that folks have in their Toolbox all of the tools.,166,,
976,0.97,6342.736,6357.05,This is about broadening the number of tools that we offer to community and investing those tools in upstream ways so we can protect our community as well as investing in their health.,166,,

991,0.97,6450.21,6462.556,We're gonNA talk about you a little more about each of these.,167,,
992,0.97,6462.556,6465.525,And increasing access to housing.,167,,
993,0.97,6465.525,6484.244,"As Council member Mosqueda mentioned, while the uprisings that led to this political opening to divest SPD may be unprecedented, black and Brown communities for years have been holding down the analysis, the research, the skills and the lived experience to know that policing and imprisonment fail us.",167,,
994,0.97,6484.244,6492.319,The city's previous commitment to growing and expanding police budgets and expanding systems of Incarceration have forced us to become experts in these matters.,167,,
995,0.97,6492.319,6498.859,And this proposal reflects that expertise.,167,,
996,0.97,6498.859,6504.097,The first phase will be followed by deeper cuts to the 2021 budget cycle.,167,,
997,0.97,6504.097,6507.2,Coupled with the 2021 budgeting process that we spoke about last week.,167,,
998,0.97,6507.2,6520.914,This will allow community to determine the direction of deeper investments to generate true public health and safety.,167,,
999,0.97,6520.914,6528.822,"In terms of the SPD cuts, we're asking for immediate cuts in 2020 beyond the $20 million identified by the executive.",167,,
1000,0.97,6528.822,6530.657,The you cans need to begin this year.,167,,
1001,0.97,6530.657,6542.536,"The city has to commit to the reorganization of the police Department to both reduce its size, Reallocate its funds and positions to city departments and community organizations that are better suited to creating public health and safety.",167,,
1002,0.97,6542.536,6546.006,I want to clarify just a few points.,167,,
1003,0.97,6546.006,6549.242,We're asking for 50% cuts to SPD's budget.,167,,
1004,0.97,6549.242,6553.446,And we know those cuts will come from the money remaining in their 2020 budget.,167,,
1005,0.97,6553.446,6556.75,"Which as we've just heard, much of it has already been spent.",167,,
1006,0.97,6556.75,6560.854,And we know those cuts will be phased in during the last four months of the year.,167,,
1007,0.97,6560.854,6567.26,"As detailed in this document we present to you today, some of these cuts would come from fully eliminating SPD Funks.",167,,
1008,0.97,6567.26,6573.166,Some would come from Transitioning Funks out of SPD that should never have been under police control to begin with.,167,,
1009,0.97,6573.166,6575.936,And others will come from Hypering freezes and Rucks in staffing.,167,,
1010,0.97,6575.936,6580.74,We welcome any other cuts that you all would like to help us identify.,167,,
1011,0.97,6580.74,6594.054,"It is only recently because of the budgeting request process that we are getting the level of detail to the police budget that always should have been public, questioned before signing off on the budget increases in the last ten, 20 years.",167,,
1012,0.97,6594.054,6610.203,"So with that, I'm gonNA move on and hand this over to Sean glaze who will talk to us about the first bucket.",167,,
1013,0.97,6610.203,6611.404,Thank you.,168,,
1014,0.97,6611.404,6628.488,If you could make the view of the document a little larger.,168,,
1015,0.97,6646.006,6647.507,"Hi, everyone I'm Shawn.",169,,
1016,0.97,6647.507,6654.614,And I'm here to talk about the community investment.,169,,
1017,0.97,6654.614,6660.42,Investment community search process to generate true safety informed by community need.,169,,
1018,0.97,6660.42,6671.998,What we know is that these initial investments which will be funded by Divestments from the SPD budget should go to funding a 2020 summer and fall research process.,169,,
1019,0.97,6671.998,6681.041,That could be crucial to Reimagining the world in a community vision for public safety and health.,169,,
1020,0.97,6681.041,6689.883,We have a long history in Seattle.,169,,
1021,0.97,6689.883,6691.584,Having Divestments in communities of color.,169,,
1022,0.97,6691.584,6703.596,We also know that these longstanding Disinvestments has created less community safety and more Thoorm black residents.,169,,
1023,0.97,6703.596,6716.676,"We also know that the citywide dialogue, when it's centered on Communiy needs can create the world we want to see.",169,,
1024,0.97,6716.676,6723.316,"A world where people can, where you don't have to be afraid of just living their lives.",169,,
1025,0.97,6723.316,6733.626,We also know that this will help support people who are most directly--contact and surveillance to systematically produce our own solutions to guide the city's next step.,169,,
1026,0.97,6733.626,6741.935,"Without community voice and leadership, any proposed solutions are likely to be shortsighted, incomplete, and actively harmful.",169,,
1027,0.97,6741.935,6743.937,This is a really important key.,169,,
1028,0.97,6743.937,6749.342,That there is community voice and community leadership.,169,,
1029,0.97,6749.342,6758.451,"In this report here, you can see that a portion will be explicitly focused on community safety.",169,,
1030,0.97,6758.451,6765.258,And offering specifically originations and support to community organizations as they fail in those capacities.,169,,
1031,0.97,6765.258,6776.669,"That would include things like analyses and projections to help inform staffing, resource allocations, and really support, again, these other buckets of the work.",169,,
1032,0.97,6776.669,6788.548,The research will also be exploring testing and evaluating different strategies to make safer communities.,169,,
1033,0.97,6788.548,6794.487,Covid is a big concern for our communes.,169,,
1034,0.97,6794.487,6802.095,Our plan includes a deep exploration of how effective research and outreach can be done in this challenging context.,169,,
1035,0.97,6802.095,6810.703,It includes recommendations and evaluations that will become the anticipated outcomes for the summer and fall outage.,169,,
1036,0.97,6810.703,6813.206,And all of that informs the Twep 21 budgeting process.,169,,
1037,0.97,6813.206,6819.512,It's a lot of components.,169,,
1038,0.97,6819.512,6826.719,The research will go toward defining what community safety and health is for.,169,,
1039,0.97,6826.719,6846.005,It will also go toward understanding how to make accessible and equitable moving forward.,169,,
1040,0.97,6846.005,6848.141,The process must be Community-69Ed and controlled.,169,,
1041,0.97,6848.141,6849.542,One of the big things is trough.,169,,
1042,0.97,6849.542,6852.145,It's essential to have trust when you're checking the data.,169,,
1043,0.97,6852.145,6856.482,And the city actually has a long track record of Misusing this trust.,169,,
1044,0.97,6856.482,6869.262,In part because the city has a long track record of supporting harmful policies and or maybe not listening to the community.,169,,
1045,0.97,6869.262,6872.565,But the other pattern shares collecting data and recommendations and not following through.,169,,
1046,0.97,6872.565,6909.903,"And that's a big piece of why the SPD--and that's a big reason why we've been really thoughtful around how to connect with 2020 all summer community process with their 2021, 2022 Participatory budgeting process is to really make sure that everything--able to take action based on the community feedback.",169,,
1047,0.97,6911.17,6920.28,It is crucial in this type of process that community members are involved in the dialogue.,169,,
1048,0.97,6920.28,6928.121,"They're supported in terms of their--compensated for their research, for the labor they offer.",169,,
1049,0.97,6928.121,6932.392,As well as their giving they need in order to be successful and participate fully.,169,,
1050,0.97,6932.392,6946.506,Part of what that means for us is that the urgency of why we're facing community research first is so that we can hit the ground running and be able to provide that support during this time of Covid.,169,,
1051,0.97,6946.506,6954.948,So we know that the scale cannot be met with labor alone.,169,,
1052,0.97,6954.948,6960.219,And especially when community members are Prioritizing shelter.,169,,
1053,0.97,6960.219,6970.53,"During a global pandemic, it's important that you be really thoughtful how to provide support.",169,,
1054,0.97,6970.53,6976.97,I wanted to talk a little bit about the research activity.,169,,
1055,0.97,6976.97,6979.372,What does it look like?,169,,
1056,0.97,6979.372,6986.546,The proposal is that 12% of the total funds that we would receive would be useful for research.,169,,
1057,0.97,6986.546,6994.854,We're asking for a smaller sum be released immediately.,169,,
1058,0.97,6994.854,6997.323,Because there are five million components of research.,169,,
1059,0.97,6997.323,7000.893,And some of them have already started.,169,,
1060,0.97,7000.893,7007.0,"The first phase that will need funding includes staffing, training, technical support and material.",169,,
1061,0.97,7007.0,7013.973,"Because of our deep connections with communities, we don't have to spend a lot of time just trying to figure out who the players are.",169,,
1062,0.97,7013.973,7024.55,But we do need to make sure that the funding is available as soon as possible so that people can be brought up to speed and hit the ground running.,169,,
1063,0.97,7024.55,7036.062,"The second research activity I want to highlight is support like Ppe, certain tomorrows that we'll need in order to maintain social distancing.",169,,
1064,0.97,7036.062,7040.033,"And in that Connectivity, that people can actually participate if N these.",169,,
1065,0.97,7040.033,7047.039,Which is something that has been a barrier to many people in our community.,169,,
1066,0.97,7047.039,7052.245,The Sthird institutional barriers.,169,,
1067,0.97,7052.245,7053.679,"Problems with translation, transportation.",169,,
1068,0.97,7053.679,7054.647,Data collection and analysis.,169,,
1069,0.97,7054.647,7056.416,I think that is pretty straight forward.,169,,
1070,0.97,7056.416,7063.055,But it'll include a mix of quantitative and qualitative.,169,,
1071,0.97,7063.055,7068.928,And other kinds of data collection and analysis.,169,,
1072,0.97,7068.928,7072.865,Focus groups and lots of different activities that you'll see mentioned in the Appendix.,169,,
1073,0.97,7072.865,7080.073,And the last is about data reporting and presentation.,169,,
1074,0.97,7080.073,7083.476,That might Scld things like a traditional research report.,169,,
1075,0.97,7083.476,7090.783,But most of what we're really focused on is being transparent with community and what it takes to do that.,169,,
1076,0.97,7090.783,7104.964,As well as decisions that are happening at the approximately level so that everything--we're able to provide recommendations.,169,,
1077,0.97,7104.964,7115.708,I did want to say we do have some criteria for the organizations to review finding in the document that we sent.,169,,
1078,0.97,7115.708,7121.814,"As well as the Timeline that includes from July, which is now, through December.",169,,
1079,0.97,7121.814,7126.719,What are the key pieces that will be happening each time?,169,,
1080,0.97,7126.719,7139.499,Right now our ongoing phase is talking with community members and forming preliminary research to pass accessible language and report for the Summer/Fall research.,169,,
1081,0.97,7139.499,7141.467,I think I will hand it off to the next person.,169,,
1082,0.97,7141.467,7142.635,Thank you for your time.,169,,
1083,0.97,7142.635,7150.143,And I'm happy to follow up on questions.,169,,
1084,0.97,7150.143,7154.213,Would the panelists prefer for us to take questions in each segment?,170,,
1085,0.97,7154.213,7157.65,I think this was a really great and dense and detailed document.,170,,
1086,0.97,7157.65,7166.259,"If it's okay, I'm just looking for a nod of approval here.",170,,
1087,0.97,7166.259,7166.492,Okay.,170,,
1088,0.97,7166.492,7170.563,We are locking at phase 1 investment number one.,170,,
1089,0.97,7170.563,7195.221,Which is the Community-Led research process to generate public safety informed by community meeting sessions.,170,,
1090,0.97,7214.14,7214.507,Thank you.,171,,
1091,0.97,7214.507,7215.908,"Yeah, I don't have a question.",171,,
1092,0.97,7215.908,7224.717,I just want to congratulate all of you for putting this document together.,171,,
1093,0.97,7224.717,7225.318,So quickly.,171,,
1094,0.97,7225.318,7228.921,I know this is work you've all been doing anyway.,171,,
1095,0.97,7228.921,7238.13,"But the speed with which you do your research, analysis, your planning together, to be able to present this to us is really inspiring.",171,,
1096,0.97,7238.13,7246.939,And I do want to say--first I just want to preface this by saying I'm not sure where we are in the process of talking about amendments.,171,,
1097,0.97,7246.939,7267.96,"But I have signalled to our central staff one of the issues, ideas that we have is to shift the $5 Hundred,000 that Greg had just been talking about, I believe that is the funding that SPD is shifting to don.",171,,
1098,0.97,7267.96,7286.445,"And that is the funding that we are intending to use to amend, to be able to provide resource with this.",171,,
1099,0.97,7286.445,7289.548,We have lots of issues for cutting budgets.,171,,
1100,0.97,7289.548,7292.585,But that is one of things that we got in.,171,,
1101,0.97,7292.585,7299.425,And we'll talk about that more later.,171,,
1102,0.97,7299.425,7299.692,Thank you.,171,,
1103,0.97,7299.692,7303.496,Thank you.,172,,
1104,0.97,7303.496,7305.297,Any additional questions here?,172,,
1105,0.97,7305.297,7307.099,I am not seeing a hand.,172,,
1106,0.97,7307.099,7312.071,I will NOTE my appreciation for this detailed first component.,172,,
1107,0.97,7312.071,7325.184,My sort of reading of what you have outlined in this extremely person document is a process for which things that will continue to evolve will come from.,172,,
1108,0.97,7325.184,7340.499,And that will allow for the recommendations for creating community safety strategies to be really rooted in community needs and those who have lived experience who have done the research.,172,,
1109,0.97,7340.499,7346.172,Who have ample opportunities to provide feedback are absolutely at the table making those recommendations.,172,,
1110,0.97,7346.172,7357.283,And this is putting into action that concrete plan.,172,,
1111,0.97,7361.787,7363.656,Council member Herbold.,173,,
1112,0.97,7363.656,7375.067,"Just a question for you, chair Mosqueda.",174,,
1113,0.97,7375.067,7383.809,I did have a question related to the cut recommendation recommendations.,174,,
1114,0.97,7383.809,7385.578,Hold them till the end of the presentation?,174,,
1115,0.97,7385.578,7386.779,"Sure, that's a good idea.",175,,
1116,0.97,7386.779,7390.015,"That works, thank you.",176,,
1117,0.97,7390.015,7392.852,"With that I thank you again, Shawn, for the overview there.",177,,
1118,0.97,7392.852,7399.959,I'll turn it back over to the panel for item number 2.,177,,
1119,0.97,7399.959,7406.999,That will be Nekitta Oliver.,178,,
1120,0.97,7406.999,7410.136,I'm an Organizer with Decriminalize Seattle.,179,,
1121,0.97,7410.136,7418.01,And apologize for the delay in the presentation that we had a student doing work.,179,,
1122,0.97,7418.01,7419.311,A lot of noise happening right now.,179,,
1123,0.97,7419.311,7431.123,"In order for us to make this transition effective, a key part of this is going to be Prioritizing our investments in Scaling up Communit organizations.",179,,
1124,0.97,7431.123,7439.331,And really bolstering the ability to do their work and to make their expertise able to serve all of Seattle.,179,,
1125,0.97,7439.331,7443.636,It's going to require an immense Raument of technical support and Capacity-Building.,179,,
1126,0.97,7443.636,7450.309,"And ultimately, this is going to lead to an increase in public safety for everyone in our city.",179,,
1127,0.97,7450.309,7459.919,We know that the focus of diverting resources from the police and armed responses means that we need an increase in infrastructure.,179,,
1128,0.97,7459.919,7468.561,And in particular types of responses that Community-Based organizations have been able to develop through direct social services.,179,,
1129,0.97,7468.561,7472.465,And these particular responses address the root causes of poverty and violence in our communities.,179,,
1130,0.97,7472.465,7476.869,They do a lot more than simply intervene.,179,,
1131,0.97,7476.869,7483.609,"In many cases, these organizations have effective strategies that prevent harm and violence.",179,,
1132,0.97,7483.609,7496.155,"Community-Led solutions also prevent Overpolicing and police brutality, especially in marginalized communities by limiting our eliminating the presence of an armed police force.",179,,
1133,0.97,7496.155,7502.795,Spd has had over a century to produce public safety for everyone in our city and has failed.,179,,
1134,0.97,7502.795,7513.305,"And knowing that our communities are not safer, especially our black and native community, need a and innovation approach to public safety.",179,,
1135,0.97,7513.305,7522.081,And this innovation approach could ensure that all Seattleites get the investment in our public safety system.,179,,
1136,0.97,7522.081,7541.367,"But especially Seattleites who are black, native, query and Trans, people of color, people with Disables and communities that are economically marginalized who are often the victims of Overpolicing and police brutality.",179,,
1137,0.97,7541.367,7546.639,Community-Led and Community-Based initiatives ensure that people's struggles are not Criminalized.,179,,
1138,0.97,7546.639,7555.247,And it instead ensures that people can get the hope they need by providing supportive environments to help community members tackle challenges we face.,179,,
1139,0.97,7555.247,7562.454,"Such as housing instability, mental health, drug addiction, domestic violence, education, economic lack of access to opportunity.",179,,
1140,0.97,7562.454,7566.325,And ultimately improve public health and safety for our entire city.,179,,
1141,0.97,7566.325,7568.56,What does Scaling up look like?,179,,
1142,0.97,7568.56,7577.369,"In this first phase, Scaling up looks like increasing social support, housing.",179,,
1143,0.97,7577.369,7585.177,"Providing mental health and drug addiction serves, Doments support, emergency responses, crisis intervention and violence interruption teams rather than armed police.",179,,
1144,0.97,7585.177,7608.267,"And while many of these organizes already exist, you heard about the center resource process, which allows to have deeper work to identify and what exactly we need to support our city.",179,,
1145,0.97,7608.267,7617.209,Defunded from SPD and groups that are already implementing and developing this Community-Led alternative to policing and innovation.,179,,
1146,0.97,7617.209,7622.381,Seattle already has groups involved in Nonarmed crisis response.,179,,

1150,0.97,7638.631,7646.038,And certainly not comparable to what the armed police have been receiving for nearly a hundred years.,179,,
1151,0.97,7646.038,7652.845,"For decades, Seattle organizations Úhave been undertaking safety building activities, which include things like self-defense classes.",179,,

1161,0.97,7686.578,7696.088,And these efforts have developed and survived despite Overinvestments in the current policing and Criminalization paradigm.,179,,
1162,0.97,7696.088,7703.996,"We want it to be acknowledged that we know we would like a quick transition into Community-Led, Xun-Based public safety.",179,,
1163,0.97,7703.996,7712.037,"However, community organizations should not end in one funding cycle be expected to end all violence in Seattle.",179,,
1164,0.97,7712.037,7727.219,"What we do know is that investment in Commune-Led initiatives now and responses so they can be scaled up in Mid-2021 will drastically increase the odds of generating true public health, true public safety for all of our communities.",179,,
1165,0.97,7727.219,7735.327,Especially for those communities who have borne brunt of police presence surveillance and violence.,179,,
1166,0.97,7735.327,7740.199,Projects all go toward incubating new organizations and police impacted communities.,179,,
1167,0.97,7740.199,7741.934,And these investments must happen in 2020.,179,,
1168,0.97,7741.934,7749.174,We need to build up these organizations' capacity in order to be ready for the transition to drastically reduce police Footprint.,179,,
1169,0.97,7749.174,7753.846,And we don't want to be starting from scratch in 2021.,179,,
1170,0.97,7753.846,7757.85,The time for these investments would be September 2020 through December 2020.,179,,
1171,0.97,7757.85,7778.737,And the work that it entails in order for us to get to the place where in 2021 we're ready to have enhanced serves would be for establishing criteria and Grant-Making processes that are not burdensome to Commune-Based organizations that protect the Fidelity of the work and allow them to focus their efforts on Scaling up.,179,,
1172,0.97,7778.737,7787.613,We need to provide Capacity-Building workshops offered by the city for organizes applying for funds.,179,,
1173,0.97,7787.613,7796.088,And we need to ensure that monthly Sdurment of funds happens so organizes do not expect to float the amount they're expecting from the city.,179,,
1174,0.97,7796.088,7804.997,Such a setup would be prohibitive for many effective grassroots Community-Led initiatives and will prevent them from being able to scale up to the level necessary.,179,,
1175,0.97,7804.997,7824.049,"The same way that we have historically invested in the Seattle police Department and given them access to a budget Upfront, we need to be treating Community-Led organizations, Community-Led initiatives with the same value of allowing them to have access to those funds on the front end.",179,,
1176,0.97,7824.049,7832.925,This will allow organizes to create plans for Scaling up responses as well as to complete recruitment and hiring plans.,179,,
1177,0.97,7832.925,7836.228,Lastly we need to establish what the Regranting process looks hike in 2021.,179,,
1178,0.97,7836.228,7844.937,We want to already have this plan ready to go so we're not scrambling at the point when we're ready for the enhanced serves to take place.,179,,
1179,0.97,7844.937,7856.748,"And by establishing that now in 2020, we'll already have our eyes set on what kind of capacity and technical support we need to provide community based organizes in Accessing grants and Funs.",179,,
1180,0.97,7856.748,7866.058,"Lastly, to allow community Orgs the best opportunity to scale up, we need to create space for them to focus their efforts on growth and development.",179,,
1181,0.97,7866.058,7873.465,"And those grants, the grants that are given, need to be for general operating Funs.",179,,
1182,0.97,7873.465,7878.17,"Historically, the city has granted organize funds that are often heavily restricted.",179,,
1183,0.97,7878.17,7881.673,And those restrictions make it hard to do the work effectively.,179,,
1184,0.97,7881.673,7886.545,And it needs to happen with minimal bureaucratic requirements.,179,,
1185,0.97,7886.545,7889.982,The funding should support Capacity-Building support for Orgs.,179,,
1186,0.97,7889.982,7902.06,"And that support should look like an increased ability to create infrastructure, which would include space, curricula, financial management systems, training programs and more.",179,,
1187,0.97,7902.06,7915.507,And all of this ultimately would lend itself to having a more robust public health and safety structure for everyone in Seattle.,179,,
1188,0.97,7915.507,7916.575,Thank you very much.,180,,
1189,0.97,7916.575,7919.945,Appreciate your flexibility in the location for presenting this.,180,,
1190,0.97,7919.945,7923.282,Thank you for your time.,180,,
1191,0.97,7923.282,7930.922,"Council colleagues before we move onto item number 3, are there questions for the Presenters?",180,,
1192,0.97,7930.922,7934.026,I had one comment they will make.,181,,
1193,0.97,7934.026,7938.73,Thank you your noting the importance of having a streamlined application process.,181,,
1194,0.97,7938.73,7943.302,Especially as we think about more diverse organizations participating with the city.,181,,
1195,0.97,7943.302,7950.309,I know that this is something that we had endeavored to try to do in past efforts.,181,,
1196,0.97,7950.309,7952.511,Council member Gonzcez probably had some great examples as well.,181,,
1197,0.97,7952.511,7955.414,"Would you like to speak to that, Council President?",181,,
1198,0.97,7955.414,7965.557,"Yeah, thank you so much for that.",182,,
1199,0.97,7965.557,7972.664,I think it's really important for us to make shower that we get that process of Grant-Making right.,182,,
1200,0.97,7972.664,7986.478,"So many organizes, particularly smaller ones, particularly ones that are led Gent have the organizational capacity that other organizations typically have.",182,,
1201,0.97,7986.478,7996.555,To support that intensity of those process processes.,182,,
1202,0.97,7996.555,8011.803,There is history in the city of trying to reduce the barriers in those processes to facilitate being able to get money out to organizations who are building their capacity.,182,,
1203,0.97,8011.803,8014.773,So really excited that that is part of this plan.,182,,
1204,0.97,8014.773,8019.411,I think it's absolutely critical to make sure that we get that process right.,182,,
1205,0.97,8019.411,8038.53,Because I really see that that's where a lot of things can go wrong and go astray in term of the intent of properly funding capacity building and providing technical assistance to smaller organizations to scale up in the way that's been described B panelists.,182,,
1206,0.97,8038.53,8040.599,So excited to see that part.,182,,
1207,0.97,8040.599,8064.356,And looking forward to seeing how we can use models that we used in the levy and the Department neighborhood voice your choice.,182,,
1208,0.97,8065.123,8065.857,Thank you.,183,,
1209,0.97,8065.857,8068.86,And thank you to the little Council member as well.,183,,
1210,0.97,8068.86,8070.095,We appreciate your comments.,183,,
1211,0.97,8070.095,8075.634,"Council member Sawant, please go ahead.",183,,
1212,0.97,8075.634,8084.342,Thank you . Just wanted to take the opportunity to thank all the community organizers.,184,,
1213,0.97,8084.342,8085.877,Who are present today.,184,,
1214,0.97,8085.877,8099.891,Those who have been doing the work to say that this is I really appreciate all the concrete points.,184,,
1215,0.97,8099.891,8106.298,And also just to reiterate the point made by the Presenters that the funds should be made available Upfront.,184,,
1216,0.97,8106.298,8138.964,"And this is very important because we don't want the Mayor's office or anybody else to set community organizations up for failure but not making the funds that they would need to actually have these alternative program programs, as an alternative for police commune safety and police violence.",184,,
1217,0.97,8138.964,8142.634,Having the funds available Upfront is extremely crucial.,184,,
1218,0.97,8142.634,8150.742,"And certainly the people's movement and my office, of course as I've said many Timeses, are strongly committed to making that happen.",184,,
1219,0.97,8150.742,8161.119,"And I'm also happy to hear the organizers also say that work with the community is looking for, and this something we emphasize over and over again, that we don't want to wait to begin the Defunding.",184,,
1220,0.97,8161.119,8165.423,We want to do the Defunding by 20% starting this year.,184,,
1221,0.97,8165.423,8168.293,And it's a question of making those funds available.,184,,
1222,0.97,8168.293,8171.93,But not saying that all the programs have been ready to go.,184,,
1223,0.97,8171.93,8175.834,Because that's not possible to happen.,184,,
1224,0.97,8175.834,8189.881,"Because the organizations need the opportunity to bring them up, up to the capacity that we will need in order to be placed among the functions of the police which have been quite harmful.",184,,
1225,0.97,8189.881,8193.818,"So in 9-1-1 response, being one of the points.",184,,
1226,0.97,8193.818,8204.296,Then also as one of the ways we can release the funds also to make sure that the administrative justice and constructive programs are being funded.,184,,
1227,0.97,8204.296,8216.107,"Also to point out that a lot of things the police do which are extremely problematic which is harassing poor people, harassing homeless neighbors, Overpolicing protest movements.",184,,
1228,0.97,8216.107,8229.521,"We just saw in the previous presentations with staff, and you've seen this from the Mayor's office weeks ago that the Seattle police Department spent over $6 million on just policing the George Floyd protest movement.",184,,
1229,0.97,8229.521,8242.701,So there are many things that can be eliminated that are costing taxpayer dollars and are not helpful to the community and are especially harmful to communities of color.,184,,
1230,0.97,8242.701,8256.548,"And that those dollars can be invested not only in the alternative to policing but also in other things that the same communities need like affordable Housin, like other social services.",184,,
1231,0.97,8256.548,8274.566,"Sxiveng to that end, in addition to the Defunding, the other demand being brought forward by the movement and black lives matter movement which is having an independently elected Community-Oversight board that has powers, including hiring and firing over the police.",184,,
1232,0.97,8274.566,8279.904,And policies and procedures so that the community can actually hold elected leaders accountable on what the police are doing.,184,,
1233,0.97,8279.904,8283.074,"Not only how much money they have, but what are they doing with that money?",184,,
1234,0.97,8283.074,8288.38,Are they harassing homeless people?,184,,
1235,0.97,8288.38,8292.384,Are they still having homeless neighbors and homeless Encampments?,184,,
1236,0.97,8292.384,8296.187,Or are the funds used by the police actually going to be beneficial to the community?,184,,
1237,0.97,8296.187,8297.856,Thank you.,185,,
1238,0.97,8297.856,8304.896,"And Council member Herbold, I saw ya.",185,,
1239,0.97,8304.896,8305.597,Thank you.,186,,
1240,0.97,8305.597,8326.418,"I just wanted to also echo the comments of Council member Sawant and earlier, council member Mosqueda in thanking the Presenters for identifying the needs for a Community-Driven research project.",186,,
1241,0.97,8326.418,8340.832,I too have included that in my proposal that we'll talk about later that includes possible cuts and possible ad ads.,186,,
1242,0.97,8340.832,8357.248,I want to also thank Ms. Oliver for acknowledging the reality that the need to support community organizations in a Ramp-Up is not gonNA happen overnight.,186,,
1243,0.97,8357.248,8372.197,I want to recognize is that this Vey community request for us to take a VOLT in this budget session to begin that process.,186,,
1244,0.97,8372.197,8375.266,That does involve some cuts to the SPD's budget.,186,,
1245,0.97,8375.266,8379.637,And I think that will allow us to have these conversations.,186,,
1246,0.97,8379.637,8386.111,Not just conversations with community about the Replac functions.,186,,
1247,0.97,8386.111,8393.785,For some of the SPD Funks that we are talking about moving into other parts of the city government.,186,,
1248,0.97,8393.785,8403.595,As well as into Community-Driven solution solutions.,186,,
1249,0.97,8403.595,8422.013,It also allows us to have the necessary conversation as it relates to the budget cuts that we might implement in this budget session that have labor implication implications.,186,,
1250,0.97,8422.013,8429.421,Those cuts that might have labor implications will need to be bargained.,186,,
1251,0.97,8429.421,8440.432,And I think our approach that we're talking about today allows us to begin those Conferrings about bargaining those now.,186,,
1252,0.97,8440.432,8442.7,Rather than waiting till passing a budget in November.,186,,
1253,0.97,8442.7,8445.637,And I think it's really important to do that.,186,,
1254,0.97,8445.637,8466.057,And a number of us have requested that labor relations get Getin touch with Saag and Spma to indicate our interests in having those discussions after August 3RD after the Council passes a budget.,186,,
1255,0.97,8466.057,8470.328,And we have a good sense of which might have impacts on labor.,186,,
1256,0.97,8470.328,8492.45,Thank you for your very thoughtful approach about how scale up investments in the 40 but how we might scale cuts in the last four months of 2020.,186,,
1257,0.97,8492.45,8501.192,And we have a request into central staff to talk about how we would Operationalize a skilled cut.,186,,
1258,0.97,8501.192,8512.937,"Normally when the Council passes a budget, whether or not it Ad-As or cuts these actions are implemented at the beginning of the budget year.",186,,
1259,0.97,8512.937,8515.607,Or in this case be implemented all in September.,186,,
1260,0.97,8515.607,8518.176,But I don't think we want to do that.,186,,
1261,0.97,8518.176,8527.919,We want to talk about trying to scale them month by month in a way that corresponds with our spending plan for 2020.,186,,
1262,0.97,8527.919,8537.629,So again I really appreciate your thoughtful approach in laying out your Four-Point plan.,186,,
1263,0.97,8537.629,8541.032,"Okay, thank you so much.",187,,
1264,0.97,8541.032,8547.438,I'm not seeing or hearing additional question questions.,187,,
1265,0.97,8547.438,8549.307,Thank you for walking through this piece.,187,,
1266,0.97,8549.307,8553.811,I think one of the key pieces you mentioned was something said in the previous balance.,187,,
1267,0.97,8553.811,8558.149,We are talking about investing in the criteria that you have outlined.,187,,
1268,0.97,8558.149,8561.552,The organization that you have listed here.,187,,
1269,0.97,8561.552,8569.827,And the type of qualifications already highlight that there's many organizations that are skilled in public safety.,187,,
1270,0.97,8569.827,8571.429,And community public health strategies.,187,,
1271,0.97,8571.429,8576.267,So it is not starting from scratch.,187,,
1272,0.97,8576.267,8578.536,"As your proposal outlined, it is Scaling in.",187,,
1273,0.97,8578.536,8582.574,There is much expertise and existing organizations on how we bring them to scale.,187,,
1274,0.97,8582.574,8586.077,It really relies on us investing in them and Ramping up.,187,,
1275,0.97,8586.077,8592.283,Any additional comments before we move onto the next person?,187,,
1276,0.97,8592.283,8592.483,Okay.,187,,
1277,0.97,8592.483,8603.594,"If we captured any of that incorrectly, feel free to let us know.",187,,
1278,0.97,8603.594,8607.999,Okay.,187,,
1279,0.97,8607.999,8608.6,Item number three.,187,,
1280,0.97,8608.6,8610.201,I will take this one.,188,,
1281,0.97,8610.201,8612.203,This is to be a shorter one.,188,,
1282,0.97,8612.203,8618.209,We believe the city of Seattle with immediately move to Triangle 9-1-1 call dispatch under civilian control.,188,,
1283,0.97,8618.209,8625.416,We dent need to wait until 2021 to create a new independent emergency operations system.,188,,
1284,0.97,8625.416,8642.533,Responsible for coordinating responders and moving 9-1-1 dispatch again out of police control.,188,,
1285,0.97,8642.533,8661.152,The Mltsdz we have now often results in poor people of color in crisis receiving an armed police response and being funneled into the legal system while white people in crisis are offered supportive serves.,188,,
1286,0.97,8661.152,8664.055,This is not going to work.,188,,
1287,0.97,8664.055,8667.759,I also wanted to touch on another piece here.,188,,
1288,0.97,8667.759,8673.765,We need to be combining 9-1-1 with investments in community organization who can respond to crisis Calms.,188,,
1289,0.97,8673.765,8682.04,"And also investments in fully funding the services of the housing so that crisis workers, when they do respond to a call can actually offer an appropriate referral.",188,,
1290,0.97,8682.04,8688.713,All these pieces are going to have to work together.,188,,
1291,0.97,8688.713,8692.95,I want to take a second to talk about the work that also belongs in that bucket.,188,,
1292,0.97,8692.95,8695.386,This may not happen in this immediate vote.,188,,
1293,0.97,8695.386,8709.467,It is key for setting us up for successful we need to Decriminalize.,188,,
1294,0.97,8709.467,8721.112,"We know that the black and Brown and native folks seem to become a criminal matter much more quickly, whereas white folks might be sent to supportive housing or mental health.",188,,
1295,0.97,8721.112,8726.217,We need to be Decriminalizing the charges that currently really criminalize poverty.,188,,
1296,0.97,8726.217,8734.892,And we know that people in Seattle or people of color are disproportionately Criminalized right now for all of these low-level offenses.,188,,
1297,0.97,8734.892,8744.202,We know that results in enormous expenditures not just in police but in court offices and King County jail.,188,,
1298,0.97,8744.202,8753.678,And we know Decriminal easing these procedures will free up human needs and be I'll pause there.,188,,
1299,0.97,8759.183,8760.985,Thank you for that presentation.,189,,
1300,0.97,8760.985,8764.455,Any question on that presentation?,189,,
1301,0.97,8764.455,8764.689,Okay.,189,,
1302,0.97,8764.689,8780.538,There's been a lot of conversation lately about this Consep replacing the current 9-1-1 operations and Reallocating some of those calls to different community groups or having a different response.,189,,
1303,0.97,8780.538,8783.774,I see Council member Strauss and Council member Sawant.,189,,
1304,0.97,8783.774,8786.577,"Thank you, chair Moskweda.",190,,
1305,0.97,8786.577,8793.084,I really appreciate this conversation around replacing the current 9-1-1 operations outside of SPD.,190,,
1306,0.97,8793.084,8802.493,And I think the next level of the conversation also needs to be about the policies directing 9-1-1 calls.,190,,
1307,0.97,8802.493,8824.882,Because to have officer patrol time taken up to arrive and assess a scene that is then deemed to have either community intervention or one of our existing programs--I love how cahoots is really just becoming this named idea that we all can understand in a clear way.,190,,
1308,0.97,8824.882,8835.493,"But the fact that we have low Acuity programs already in the city that are very similar, all that to say an officer has to refer to one of the programs.",190,,
1309,0.97,8835.493,8837.028,So I don't have a question.,190,,
1310,0.97,8837.028,8842.3,I guess I'm just making a statement that as we go through this process.,190,,
1311,0.97,8842.3,8853.144,We also need to be looking at the process of of the policies that navigate those 9-1-1 calls and now we code them.,190,,
1312,0.97,8853.144,8857.148,Thank you guys for your work.,190,,
1313,0.97,8857.148,8858.716,Thank you.,191,,
1314,0.97,8858.716,8861.953,"Council member Sawant, and Council member Gonzcez?",191,,
1315,0.97,8861.953,8862.353,Okay.,191,,
1316,0.97,8862.353,8865.156,"After that, council member Herbold.",191,,
1317,0.97,8865.156,8868.826,"Council member Sawant, please go ahead.",191,,
1318,0.97,8868.826,8873.03,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",192,,
1319,0.97,8873.03,8884.075,"I just wanted to quickly say that the proposal that was put forward for Decriminalizing, I think that's a very, very important point that has been made.",192,,
1320,0.97,8884.075,8900.891,And I would really urge the city Council to go toward that and really look into what kind of policy you would need to make that actually happen.,192,,
1321,0.97,8900.891,8913.504,"Because as Mr. Rehmer has correctly stated, it is a face where we see massive racism and affecting people of color, black communities.",192,,
1322,0.97,8913.504,8917.408,"As you currently stated, it is targeting people for the crime of poverty.",192,,
1323,0.97,8917.408,8920.244,"And it's really where people get caught up in a big, big way.",192,,
1324,0.97,8920.244,8928.786,And I don't believe that any one thing is going to change this.,192,,
1325,0.97,8928.786,8932.957,There needs to be a shift in policing and everything that has been mentioned is important.,192,,
1326,0.97,8932.957,8937.128,I just wanted to important that that is one of the most important points that has been brought up today.,192,,
1327,0.97,8937.128,8940.564,"Thank you, council member Sawant.",193,,
1328,0.97,8940.564,8945.336,Council member Herbold and then Lewis.,193,,
1329,0.97,8945.336,8950.941,Thank you.,194,,
1330,0.97,8950.941,8963.187,I will just like to get a little bit more information about what it would mean to immediately move to transition 9-1-1 call and dispatch.,194,,
1331,0.97,8963.187,8963.754,Under civilian control.,194,,
1332,0.97,8963.754,8979.57,And I think it--the intention is not just putting it under civilian control whereas currently there are sworn very two sworn officers who act as supervisors to 9-1-1.,194,,
1333,0.97,8979.57,8986.477,But what it means to move it out of SPD.,194,,
1334,0.97,8986.477,8998.589,And I'd like to just get a little bit of understanding of Lodgestically what would be necessary.,194,,
1335,0.97,8998.589,9001.125,I'm imagining we're not suggesting a different number.,194,,
1336,0.97,9001.125,9011.469,So it seems to me like many of the systems that are in place would still stay in place.,194,,
1337,0.97,9011.469,9029.52,"But it would be a matter of moving that unit out of SPD and into, for instance, office of emergency management.",194,,
1338,0.97,9029.52,9031.489,Or some other central Department.,194,,
1339,0.97,9031.489,9044.335,I would like staff to research this a little bit more on what it would take and how quickly.,194,,
1340,0.97,9048.606,9060.251,"I don't believe there will be labor impacts associated with all of the same civilian Dispatchers doing the same work, just doing it in a different Department.",194,,
1341,0.97,9060.251,9067.158,I want to just make sure that we have a good understanding of what the labor impacts are as well.,194,,
1342,0.97,9067.158,9068.058,Okay.,195,,
1343,0.97,9068.058,9068.359,Wonderful.,195,,
1344,0.97,9068.359,9077.468,I know that central staff is on the line taking note of that.,195,,
1345,0.97,9077.468,9078.436,An immediate Sponto that.,195,,
1346,0.97,9078.436,9081.972,We will follow up with what we learned from central staff as well.,195,,
1347,0.97,9081.972,9095.553,"And this might be in line with what your question was, council member Lewis, in terms of how quickly you can stand something up.",195,,
1348,0.97,9095.553,9103.661,I guess this is also signalling for central staff to look into this.,196,,
1349,0.97,9103.661,9124.682,I think one of the key components is not only the moving out of 9-1-1 dispatch from SPD's chain of command but also making sure those dispatch versus some other things that aren't on police that can be sent out when there are 9-1-1 call calls.,196,,
1350,0.97,9124.682,9140.297,"I've talked extensively publicly about wanting to engage in a public process with the community in developing something that is like a Community-Based first response based on the cahoots model, the crisis assistance helping out on the streets.",196,,
1351,0.97,9140.297,9147.738,I do share the urgency of wanting to move the 9-1-1 dispatch out of SPD and sort of change the ethos.,196,,
1352,0.97,9147.738,9168.626,"And I wonder if there might be scope to expand in the interim, like, the health 1 pilot, in order to be an additional tool that 9-1-1 dispatch can send.",196,,
1353,0.97,9168.626,9173.631,Which seems to me like it could be a short-term alternative dispatch.,196,,
1354,0.97,9173.631,9182.64,Because it is gonNA take--it's gonNA take a little while to develop a cahoots style option.,196,,
1355,0.97,9182.64,9191.248,But I could definitely see a lot of merit to having like a short-term model like that.,196,,
1356,0.97,9191.248,9203.394,That could evolve into expanding the cornucopia of first response options as we kind of get along in Right-Sizing first response more broadly.,196,,
1357,0.97,9203.394,9222.379,I think the relationship of a health 1 Skail up to moving the 9-1-1 dispatch I think makes it a more Exidgent thing we should be focusing of and I would be interested in starting the conversations around moving the 9-1-1 dispatch in the summer right now.,196,,
1358,0.97,9222.379,9223.314,"Excellent, thank you.",197,,
1359,0.97,9223.314,9224.715,I see a hand.,197,,
1360,0.97,9224.715,9230.988,I think that's a really great question.,197,,
1361,0.97,9230.988,9234.124,Ir think I'll add to Kwounl member Lewis's question.,197,,
1362,0.97,9234.124,9236.827,We hear great things about the health 1 model.,197,,
1363,0.97,9236.827,9239.73,"Which is a first Responder, not a police officer.",197,,
1364,0.97,9239.73,9242.433,"But an Emt, a firefighter, and a counselor.",197,,
1365,0.97,9242.433,9255.179,"We know that there is the crisis response unit, which not part of SPD there underneath the SC, actually, and their concerns about being lumped in as part of the SPD budget overall.",197,,
1366,0.97,9255.179,9257.481,They really are mental H providers.,197,,
1367,0.97,9257.481,9260.05,I'm Wonderin about how we pull them out.,197,,
1368,0.97,9260.05,9260.451,And Colead.,197,,
1369,0.97,9260.451,9269.693,"We've seen a lot of reports lately about how the Colead model, unfortunately at this point, had been relying on referrals from the police Department.",197,,
1370,0.97,9269.693,9277.067,So all three of those instead of having them have to have a dispatch from SPD specifically.,197,,
1371,0.97,9277.067,9292.683,Are those sort of immediate strategies.,197,,
1372,0.97,9301.425,9310.1,We fully support ending police Gatekeeping for Colead.,198,,
1373,0.97,9310.1,9311.301,That's one.,198,,
1374,0.97,9311.301,9321.712,"In terms of standing up health 1 and bolstering health 1, it only gets deployed witness a 9-1-1 call has been sent from SPD dispatch to fire dispatch.",198,,
1375,0.97,9321.712,9324.014,And fire dispatch decides it's a Low-Priority call.,198,,
1376,0.97,9324.014,9330.187,Some of that would be remedied by the immediate moving of 9-1-1 out of SPD.,198,,
1377,0.97,9330.187,9335.392,"So the Decision-Makers wouldn't have an SPD provider, someone looking over their shoulder.",198,,
1378,0.97,9335.392,9347.738,"Even so, I think there's a lot of Gatekeeping and bias that happens in the name of triage that contributes to black and Brown people continually getting the criminal law enforcement response.",198,,
1379,0.97,9347.738,9351.241,"Whereas others, mainly white group, might get the sort of health 1 response.",198,,
1380,0.97,9351.241,9355.946,So we need to build into that the training and triage that would avoid that outcome.,198,,
1381,0.97,9355.946,9375.833,"Where health 1 so so health 1 needs to be staffed and led by black and Brown people, by people with individuals who have lived through homelessness, mental health, substance abuse, etc ..",198,,
1382,0.97,9375.833,9377.434,That's not currently what we're seeing.,198,,
1383,0.97,9377.434,9381.138,And it's what we want to expand on.,198,,
1384,0.97,9381.138,9386.577,It could definitely be one leg of a stool that makes up our crisis response system.,198,,
1385,0.97,9386.577,9398.789,"But it's not gonNA replace the need for Commune-Led solutions that provide support over the long-term in tackling the trauma, experienced by black and Brown and indigenous people.",198,,
1386,0.97,9398.789,9408.699,There are some serious Caveats.,198,,
1387,0.97,9408.699,9410.834,Council member Lewis.,199,,
1388,0.97,9411.135,9420.677,I just want to respond and say they totally agree with that entire assessment.,200,,
1389,0.97,9420.677,9433.724,"And in a lot of my public remarks, I've been really careful to try to distinguish between folks that try to hitch on Community-Based models like cahoots to health 1 as being an analogous response.",200,,
1390,0.97,9433.724,9447.938,"And clearly we need to make sure that we have--I think as the professor ably put, like multiple legs of the stool as we're going forward on this.",200,,
1391,0.97,9447.938,9448.739,Great.,201,,
1392,0.97,9448.739,9453.343,I'm seeing no other comments on this item.,201,,
1393,0.97,9453.343,9459.616,And we do have another final bucket.,201,,
1394,0.97,9459.616,9464.454,So thank you.,201,,
1395,0.97,9464.454,9468.459,Now we will have Isaac joy presenting on the fourth bucket.,202,,
1396,0.97,9468.459,9470.694,"Welcome, Isaac.",203,,
1397,0.97,9470.694,9471.562,"Hello, hello.",204,,
1398,0.97,9471.562,9474.064,And apologies if I'm yawning.,204,,
1399,0.97,9474.064,9479.903,I feel like a combination of a city council meeting at 4:30 and this heat is just --,204,,
1400,0.97,9479.903,9483.474,I agree.,205,,
1401,0.97,9483.474,9485.976,And all the work that we've been doing.,206,,
1402,0.97,9485.976,9487.477,All the work that we've been doing.,206,,
1403,0.97,9487.477,9489.847,So apologies if I yawn.,206,,
1404,0.97,9489.847,9507.497,"But my name is Isaac Joe, I'm a board member with the African-American U interest which is a great organization spearheading a lot of impact education efforts.",206,,
1405,0.97,9507.497,9510.901,Particularly around acquiring developing land for community development.,206,,
1406,0.97,9510.901,9514.304,"And for equitable solution, I'll say.",206,,
1407,0.97,9514.304,9516.106,So that absolutely forms my perspective.,206,,
1408,0.97,9516.106,9520.477,And I'm also here with King County equity now.,206,,
1409,0.97,9520.477,9533.19,"And for those that don't know about King County equity now, we're kind of a coalition to help folks how black lives COMM organizations.",206,,
1410,0.97,9533.19,9538.729,Really with the focus to empower the organizations that are on the ground doing the work.,206,,
1411,0.97,9538.729,9544.001,We know that particularly in this particular we're really emphasizing following community lead.,206,,
1412,0.97,9544.001,9560.55,Following the lead of the folks that the communities that have been really Opressed by these systems and have these systems to make sure that that community lead is authentic.,206,,
1413,0.97,9560.55,9566.49,So the goal was to kind of empower organizes that are on the ground because of the proximity to communities.,206,,
1414,0.97,9566.49,9568.825,Creates a different level of accountability.,206,,
1415,0.97,9568.825,9572.262,So I think this is--I just want to highlight that.,206,,
1416,0.97,9572.262,9575.866,And I think that Resonates kind of with this topic.,206,,
1417,0.97,9575.866,9590.547,"Here I find the public debate, this debate about how best to match public resources, the policies and programs, in ways that match public safety.",206,,
1418,0.97,9590.547,9606.363,There's really been overemphasis on crime and crime prevention and the implications to crime in the city.,206,,
1419,0.97,9606.363,9613.537,"Regardless of Sensationalist media narratives, Seattle does not in fact face a crisis of rising crime rates.",206,,
1420,0.97,9613.537,9615.605,Seattle faces a housing crisis.,206,,
1421,0.97,9615.605,9617.708,And housing is an essential human need.,206,,
1422,0.97,9617.708,9624.414,And this city really has failed to provide all its residents with access to this basic human need.,206,,
1423,0.97,9624.414,9633.39,"That is a safe, secure, clean, humane space that provides the bare minimum for human flourishing.",206,,
1424,0.97,9633.39,9639.196,There are really few things more central to real public safety than a home.,206,,
1425,0.97,9639.196,9647.104,"A home provide the critical stability, privacy, safety, and security necessary for individual health and communal public health.",206,,
1426,0.97,9647.104,9659.783,"And if we as a community want to maximize the near and long-term public safety for the greater Seattle region, we really must Prioritize and maximize housing access and availability.",206,,
1427,0.97,9659.783,9668.725,So what we present to you today are tangible steps that the city can take to maximize the public health region.,206,,
1428,0.97,9668.725,9675.332,We understand that this two-week rebalancing won't resolve all of the Housing-Related goals presented today.,206,,
1429,0.97,9675.332,9687.744,But we do think it's critical to Reshift this public safety debate back to the necessary--the really necessary investments that will make the most impact to our community.,206,,
1430,0.97,9687.744,9693.55,"And that's housing, particularly the housing proposal presented today.",206,,
1431,0.97,9693.55,9698.388,Some of those proposals really kind of Low-Hanging fruit.,206,,
1432,0.97,9698.388,9714.404,And these are Fermed by organizes on ground doing this work that identify Nearterm ways that we could really maximize public safety.,206,,
1433,0.97,9714.404,9729.686,"So support, media transferred unrealized public plans, Upfront transaction costs.",206,,
1434,0.97,9729.686,9746.303,"Transaction costs, for example, how we've been able to leverage all of the brilliance to create these great documents that we present to you today.",206,,
1435,0.97,9769.693,9784.674,"Any assistance, income, criminal Rerds, record of addiction.",206,,
1436,0.97,9784.674,9789.346,Fund existing black and Youth-Led Community-Based housing se organizes.,206,,
1437,0.97,9789.346,9792.749,To allow for increased capacity and services.,206,,
1438,0.97,9792.749,9796.72,Including the Facilitation of emergency rental assistance programs related to Covid.,206,,
1439,0.97,9796.72,9807.297,"We know that's gonNA be a growing need particularly as Covid continues to, you know, come to bear.",206,,
1440,0.97,9807.297,9810.367,And the implications of Covid and the economic fallout shows.,206,,
1441,0.97,9810.367,9818.575,"So we know that rental assistance is having a way to provide folks, get the folks that need it will be crucial.",206,,
1442,0.97,9818.575,9826.816,"Some other considerations for organizations that receive funding, provide services to people who are currently and formally incarcerated.",206,,
1443,0.97,9826.816,9831.188,That is crucial.,206,,
1444,0.97,9831.188,9836.326,"Commitment to offering training, infrastructure, homeless services to black and Brown folk.",206,,
1445,0.97,9836.326,9845.535,We also think it's important that the city officials remove current barriers to Accessing existent services.,206,,
1446,0.97,9845.535,9854.544,Ensuring that community service providers have direct access to harm reduction without requiring a referral from the city navigation team.,206,,
1447,0.97,9854.544,9861.518,Direct access to crisis solutions center without requiring a referral from law enforcement or first responders.,206,,
1448,0.97,9861.518,9871.261,And having access to permanent supportive housing and independent housing vouchers.,206,,
1449,0.97,9871.261,9890.08,"Again if we as a community really want to maximize near long-term public safety in greater Seattle, we really have power to maximize housing access and availability.",206,,
1450,0.97,9890.08,9895.352,Something about a 1-2 punch over here for Decrim in King County.,206,,
1451,0.97,9895.352,9897.554,"Thank you, Isaac.",207,,
1452,0.97,9897.554,9902.158,I really appreciate the presentation.,207,,
1453,0.97,9902.158,9916.306,"I also--what I really appreciate about this overview on item number 4 here is you have identified not just budget solutions but the funding--I'm sorry, the policy solutions that we can enact.",207,,
1454,0.97,9916.306,9917.274,In the near-term as well.,207,,
1455,0.97,9917.274,9925.915,Any of the comments that were made earlier about how we scale down in deference and scale down in deference to the commune.,207,,
1456,0.97,9925.915,9927.417,At the same time there's another parallel.,207,,
1457,0.97,9927.417,9934.424,What are the policy changes we could be putting into place now to reduce these barriers that you just outlined?,207,,
1458,0.97,9934.424,9938.528,That possibly don't cost the city a dime right now.,207,,
1459,0.97,9938.528,9941.798,And probably actually reduce the cost on the city overall.,207,,
1460,0.97,9941.798,9946.836,And improve the life and safety ever community members.,207,,
1461,0.97,9946.836,9956.313,"In this fourth item, I really see a lot of policy considerations that potentially could go along with the funding and Defunding strategies that have been outlined today.",207,,
1462,0.97,9956.313,9958.848,And I appreciate you highlighting those for us.,207,,
1463,0.97,9958.848,9965.822,"Council colleagues, there are Combefgs or comments on this last item?",207,,
1464,0.97,9965.822,9966.122,Okay.,207,,
1465,0.97,9966.122,9968.959,I will ask a question of the panelists.,207,,
1466,0.97,9968.959,9972.495,I know all of these items are imperative.,207,,
1467,0.97,9972.495,9976.666,I believe that you have underscored the urgency of acting now.,207,,
1468,0.97,9976.666,9990.146,"I just want to ask it does feel like the outline in the presentation, you have Prioritized to a certain degree items that you think each item could build on the other.",207,,
1469,0.97,9990.146,9993.049,Is that an accurate assessment?,207,,
1470,0.97,10010.5,10016.406,"So we've listed them in order of basically the figure of we have buckets, right?",208,,
1471,0.97,10016.406,10018.608,You have your four buckets.,208,,
1472,0.97,10018.608,10028.284,"And so in the full proposal, or the full blueprint that you have in front of you, you'll see that first bucket.",208,,
1473,0.97,10028.284,10041.097,"And that would not go to fully fund the research and move onto step 2, but rather fund the research up to $3 million, and then start funding the second bucket which is the Capacity-Building.",208,,
1474,0.97,10041.097,10048.805,"And the idea there is that because much of the research costs particularly Upfront like staffing, Tech assistance, administrative support.",208,,
1475,0.97,10048.805,10051.941,"All of that stuff starts in the summer, we need that sooner.",208,,
1476,0.97,10051.941,10059.949,"So we've ordered these in terms of you fill it out, then fill a certain all, then start going into the next bucket.",208,,
1477,0.97,10059.949,10061.918,"Etc, etc, until you get to the last Buck.",208,,
1478,0.97,10061.918,10068.558,Then you go back to the first one.,208,,
1479,0.97,10068.558,10071.895,What we're looking for is is 12% of that for research.,208,,
1480,0.97,10071.895,10074.764,At the beginning we're looking for the $3 million.,208,,
1481,0.97,10074.764,10082.238,So that will be an issue to hit the ground running and be able to set our work.,208,,
1482,0.97,10082.238,10083.64,Anything to add?,208,,
1483,0.97,10083.64,10084.574,Sure.,209,,
1484,0.97,10084.574,10086.042,I think that's right.,209,,
1485,0.97,10086.042,10095.552,"I think the other thing I'd say is Council member Mosqueda pointed out, some of the things in the fourth bucket can be done immediately.",209,,
1486,0.97,10095.552,10097.387,Particularly the disaster performance items can happen now.,209,,
1487,0.97,10097.387,10103.059,"If we get rid of the navigation team, they will no longer have a monopoly of access to the shelter beds.",209,,
1488,0.97,10103.059,10105.895,So that will be a solution.,209,,
1489,0.97,10105.895,10112.502,And we realize that investments in housing are not gonNA be resolved in this two-week budget rebalancing process.,209,,
1490,0.97,10112.502,10119.309,But we will be back before you in 2021 and beyond to make sure those investments are made.,209,,
1491,0.97,10119.309,10129.385,"In many ways it's both setting the stage for future policy changes, but it sounds like that idea is sort of the Cascading buckets, Shawn.",210,,
1492,0.97,10129.385,10137.961,That first bucket really needs to be filled so you can have the Commune-Oriented process of spending the sequence of events.,210,,
1493,0.97,10137.961,10139.129,Any additional comments?,210,,
1494,0.97,10139.129,10139.729,Go ahead.,210,,
1495,0.97,10139.729,10140.063,There you go.,210,,
1496,0.97,10140.063,10141.13,Go ahead.,210,,
1497,0.97,10141.13,10153.042,I will just add the Scaling up section is super important in 2020.,211,,
1498,0.97,10153.042,10159.282,It clear that we're not just gonNA be able to tomorrow have a fully community based initiative.,211,,
1499,0.97,10159.282,10171.661,"But if we don't take seriously the investments and Prioritizing the capacity building and technical support of organizations that we're going to expect to take on that work, then we won't be able to hit the ground running in 2021.",211,,
1500,0.97,10171.661,10185.742,"I just want really want to emphasize the support and capacity building is really essential for us to be able to take this Community-Led, Community-Based public safety initiative and make it robust in the next budget.",211,,
1501,0.97,10185.742,10189.379,Which you're going to be talking about very near.,211,,
1502,0.97,10189.379,10199.556,It's really important those dollars are invested and we see it as an investment in growing our capacity to have a public safety sector that serves everybody.,211,,
1503,0.97,10199.556,10208.598,And does that through partnership with organizations that represent the most effects of police brutality.,211,,
1504,0.97,10208.598,10220.843,And many of the organizations that do public safety work well have never had the financial opportunity to build Infrastructures that make it so we could start the whole city.,211,,
1505,0.97,10220.843,10223.212,"Often we're serving at capacity, doing very great work.",211,,
1506,0.97,10223.212,10237.227,But there is no additional funding for us to go to the infrastructure on the shoestring budget that grassroots organizations have traditionally been expected to function on.,211,,
1507,0.97,10237.227,10243.733,Fully investing that aspect of the strategy is key to ensuring that we don't set organizes up to fail.,211,,
1508,0.97,10243.733,10252.141,Which too often Grant-Making processes due.,211,,
1509,0.97,10252.141,10258.748,Organizations are actually in a position to scale up in a way that makes this new initiative and approach fully successful,211,,
1510,0.97,10258.748,10263.653,Thank you for that.,212,,
1511,0.97,10263.653,10264.354,Any additional comments?,212,,
1512,0.97,10264.354,10271.761,I see that you have the conclusion screen pulled up here.,212,,
1513,0.97,10271.761,10274.13,Council member Strauss before we get to conclusion.,212,,
1514,0.97,10274.13,10274.664,Please go ahead.,212,,
1515,0.97,10274.664,10277.7,I have something to say after the conclusion.,213,,
1516,0.97,10277.7,10278.768,"Okay, great.",214,,
1517,0.97,10278.768,10281.571,We'll have you first in the Queue.,214,,
1518,0.97,10281.571,10281.838,Professor?,214,,
1519,0.97,10281.838,10284.474,Go ahead.,214,,
1520,0.97,10284.474,10300.59,"I briefly just want to reiterate that these influential investments this is about a process, not just about Defunding the police but creating an entire new paradigm for how the city distributes funding and investments in communes.",215,,
1521,0.97,10300.59,10306.996,"The previous paradigm is what allowed to us get to the bloated questioned police budget over many, many years.",215,,
1522,0.97,10306.996,10311.768,We are interested in Defunding the police as we are in creating a new process.,215,,
1523,0.97,10311.768,10320.81,So we can close the door on the era.,215,,
1524,0.97,10320.81,10326.215,We hope you accept this invasion from us to turn over a whole new leaf.,215,,
1525,0.97,10326.215,10326.716,We'll stop there.,215,,
1526,0.97,10326.716,10327.417,Thank you.,216,,
1527,0.97,10327.417,10335.525,"Council colleagues, a few closing comments or questions are welcome.",216,,
1528,0.97,10335.525,10335.858,Thank you.,217,,
1529,0.97,10335.858,10345.835,Thank you to all of the Presenters.,217,,
1530,0.97,10345.835,10351.941,I want to clarify for the viewing public where we are in our budget process.,217,,
1531,0.97,10351.941,10356.779,"And maybe chair Mosqueda, I hope I'm not stealing your words here, but we are currently at the issue I.D.",217,,
1532,0.97,10356.779,10358.614,Section of our budget process.,217,,
1533,0.97,10358.614,10367.223,"Which means that very high-level, usually One-Line, is provided regarding what budget changes we're making.",217,,
1534,0.97,10367.223,10372.061,"We're currently at a historic point in our country's history, in the city of Seattle's history.",217,,
1535,0.97,10372.061,10382.872,And we are looking to endeavor and to make changes in how we provide public safety.,217,,
1536,0.97,10382.872,10390.646,"While these changes are, which is a One-Line sentence about budget changes.",217,,
1537,0.97,10390.646,10396.552,"So we have just received a 13-Page document about these pages, about these changes.",217,,
1538,0.97,10396.552,10402.892,So there are many more discussions to come as this budget conversation continues.,217,,
1539,0.97,10402.892,10405.294,I just wanted to root and focus us where we are.,217,,
1540,0.97,10405.294,10410.666,Almost every other budget change that we're talking about in the 2020 Rebalance has one line.,217,,
1541,0.97,10410.666,10412.034,And this change has 13 pages.,217,,
1542,0.97,10412.034,10414.871,"Thank you, chair.",217,,
1543,0.97,10414.871,10417.306,Point very well taken.,218,,
1544,0.97,10417.306,10424.414,And thanks to the community organizations who have provided this detail on this one item.,218,,
1545,0.97,10424.414,10425.815,"Council member Herbold, please go ahead.",218,,
1546,0.97,10425.815,10426.482,Thank you.,219,,
1547,0.97,10426.482,10443.332,"I want to go back to the first segment of this presentation from angelica, specifically as it relates to the recommendations to reduce patrol staffing with corresponding reduction in administrative staffing.",219,,
1548,0.97,10443.332,10453.81,I would like to get a sense of what--a little bit more detail on what it is you're proposing.,219,,
1549,0.97,10453.81,10464.253,"In my proposal that we'll discuss later, have a couple of different potential--they're not Prepsed cuts yet, but they are potential cuts.",219,,
1550,0.97,10464.253,10478.167,My goal is to put a menu of possibilities out there.,219,,
1551,0.97,10478.167,10498.287,And two items that have patrol staffing implications are the reduction of of officers who work on the navigation team.,219,,
1552,0.97,10498.287,10506.329,There would have to be some corresponding control of officers to the dollar amounts of SPD contribution to the navigation team.,219,,
1553,0.97,10506.329,10511.3,Similarly for the school resource officers.,219,,
1554,0.97,10511.3,10530.786,"The school district has indicated that they do not want school resource officers in the schools anymore in order for the city to capture those savings, we would have to reduce the patrol staffing item in the budget by a commensurate number of dollars.",219,,
1555,0.97,10530.786,10547.837,And so I just want to--get a little bit of an understanding of what your vision is for reducing patrol staffing in this budget cycle.,219,,
1556,0.97,10547.837,10549.539,In this rebalancing package.,219,,
1557,0.97,10549.539,10555.511,Again with the understanding that these reductions are--have labored impacts.,219,,
1558,0.97,10555.511,10555.745,Thank you.,219,,
1559,0.97,10560.049,10564.353,Thank you for that question.,220,,
1560,0.97,10564.353,10567.223,"As I mentioned before, there's these Dfrnl categories.",220,,
1561,0.97,10567.223,10573.663,"There's, like, parts of the SPD budget or the SPD structure that we want transferred out of SPD.",220,,
1562,0.97,10573.663,10582.238,"Like things like 9-1-1 and possibly some of the crisis counselors, service officers who might themselves welcome not being under SPD control.",220,,
1563,0.97,10582.238,10594.55,"So we realize that won't actually free up money for us, but it does reduce the police budget and this emphasis on police thing.",220,,
1564,0.97,10594.55,10604.393,"We're all just hearing today for the first time how much money is left in SPD's budget, which buckets are fully spent down and which ones aren't.",220,,
1565,0.97,10604.393,10609.365,"I think for us to be able to answer that question fully, we need to know what is left.",220,,
1566,0.97,10609.365,10620.309,"We need to know how much money from these kits is short of just beginning to cut line officers' jobs or just patrol officer jobs, how much money they will actually do.",220,,
1567,0.97,10620.309,10627.316,I think having that clarity from the city will help us be able to point to what we want to make.,220,,
1568,0.97,10627.316,10638.127,This is a question that was adjusted that I ask from the Council central staff.,221,,
1569,0.97,10638.127,10647.136,They're interested in making sure that any amendments that they propose for Council members who might request them is reflective of your goal.,221,,
1570,0.97,10647.136,10670.526,"And I think that the hope is that the goal for patrol officer staffing reduction is not simply tied to a number of dollars but that it is tied to sort of an overall sort of policy objective, right?",221,,
1571,0.97,10670.526,10677.666,And it is really tied to our reorganization goals.,221,,
1572,0.97,10677.666,10696.752,"And so that's why the potential cuts that I have are--that affect patrol, I think, are very tied to not a dollar amount that we want to realize but are tied to our desire to not have police officers on the navigation team anymore.",221,,
1573,0.97,10696.752,10704.927,And our desire to not have school resource officers in the school anymore.,221,,
1574,0.97,10704.927,10730.119,"I'm not asking for an answer right now, but if you could think a little bit about how to make any potential reductions in patrol staffing that you might teach in this moment in this 2020 rebalancing in such a way that is not--is focused less on a side cut that we want to accomplish in order to fund other Community-Based priorities.",221,,
1575,0.97,10730.119,10735.424,But that is focused on a reorganization or a policy shift that we're thinking.,221,,
1576,0.97,10735.424,10737.259,I think that would be really helpful.,221,,
1577,0.97,10737.259,10742.598,"Yes, thank you for that.",222,,
1578,0.97,10742.598,10745.201,And I think it's both.,222,,
1579,0.97,10745.201,10756.679,It's investing in these four bucks I've identified and shrinking the size of SPD because we don't believe that the current size of SPD is actually generating public safety.,222,,
1580,0.97,10758.848,10762.451,Thank you very much.,223,,
1581,0.97,10762.451,10782.071,"The other thing I wanted to flag related to that, and I believe this goes to a part of your presentation, in the last bullet on bucket two, one of the things that caught my eye is specific to I think the answer that you just gave.",223,,
1582,0.97,10782.071,10785.774,There is a desire to get funding into community organizes now.,223,,
1583,0.97,10785.774,10792.348,"There's recognition that there's community expertise, and there's organizations who need to be given resources to scale up.",223,,
1584,0.97,10792.348,10795.584,"They have the expertise, they need the resources to scale up.",223,,
1585,0.97,10795.584,10808.631,"Am I correct in understanding that to the degree that there is funding that can be realized available now, based on these cuts we want to quickly and swiftly work to get that money into those community organizations.",223,,
1586,0.97,10808.631,10820.442,But that last item also says because this is the Scaling up to realize additional support then will be available for the community Mid-2021.,223,,
1587,0.97,10820.442,10831.12,"So it also recognizes that there is, I believe, the possibility for additional bargaining.",223,,
1588,0.97,10831.12,10832.321,"Yeah, that's accurate.",224,,
1589,0.97,10832.321,10844.433,"Two things they want to touch on in regards to Council member Herbold's thoughts is, yes, obviously there are places we significantly want to decrease police officer involvement.",224,,
1590,0.97,10844.433,10851.841,And that needs to intersect though with getting the right amount of funding out of SPD.,224,,
1591,0.97,10851.841,10858.247,"The need to fully fund this strategy to be able to scale up Community-Based, Community-Led public safety initiatives is huge.",224,,
1592,0.97,10858.247,10879.501,"If you don't take that aspect of things seriously, they're going to put ourselves in a hole come Mid-2021 when we want to be able to provide these new enhanced serves and have all of the data collected actually inform a significant robust community health and public safety process.",224,,
1593,0.97,10879.501,10880.369,So yes and.,224,,
1594,0.97,10880.369,10891.38,Understanding that fully funding right now is incredibly significant to us being able to take steps forward in the future.,224,,
1595,0.97,10891.38,10892.982,And I would just say that's been one of the problems we have had in Seattle.,224,,
1596,0.97,10892.982,10898.587,We will Overfund an institution like the police Department that is not effective at producing public safety.,224,,
1597,0.97,10898.587,10903.926,And then Underfund those Community-Based strategies that we say are being effective.,224,,
1598,0.97,10903.926,10907.696,And a part of that is on like angelica was saying.,224,,
1599,0.97,10907.696,10915.537,We really have to get out of this paradigm of believing Criminalization or response to harm with armed officers is the appropriate response.,224,,
1600,0.97,10915.537,10916.105,We know it's not.,224,,
1601,0.97,10916.105,10919.174,And we know it's not the best response.,224,,
1602,0.97,10919.174,10940.029,So we just really push to be thinking about finding those intersections where being able to move officers from ineffective positions as well as divesting the amount of funding that gives us the best opportunities to scale up is just really key to us moving into this new approach.,224,,
1603,0.97,10940.029,10941.096,Okay.,225,,
1604,0.97,10941.096,10945.234,"Council member Herbold, final comment.",225,,
1605,0.97,10945.234,10947.536,Mute button,225,,
1606,0.97,10947.67,10948.203,Sorry.,226,,
1607,0.97,10948.203,10951.34,I completely agree with everything that you're saying.,226,,
1608,0.97,10951.34,10998.821,"I Jup--I do want to--as I have been doing in my conversations with Decriminalize Seattle, I want to really manage expectation expectations.",226,,
1609,0.97,10998.821,11023.912,I want to be Laser-Focused on what we need to do now to get the funding necessary for what our 2021 spending objectives are while recognizing that some of our longer-term objectives that might also realize savings that will benefit Community-Driven solutions are--may not be realized in the next four months.,226,,
1610,0.97,11023.912,11029.518,Completely understood.,227,,
1611,0.97,11029.518,11031.253,"Yes, thank you.",227,,
1612,0.97,11031.253,11032.821,I saw one more hand.,228,,
1613,0.97,11032.821,11035.491,Thank you for coming back to me.,229,,
1614,0.97,11035.491,11039.128,"And Council member Herbold, my apologies there for the last round of conversations.",229,,
1615,0.97,11039.128,11043.432,It is also my understanding that we need to be looking at our P objectives.,229,,
1616,0.97,11043.432,11049.538,And that's why it's helpful to see where we need to transition funding out of SPD.,229,,
1617,0.97,11049.538,11050.639,How that is defined.,229,,
1618,0.97,11050.639,11072.861,"Because from what I've already seen from the about blunt cut, if we just take a number and let them--let SPD make the decision, the policy decisions about how that funding is or is not used, we will see the programs that are existing within SPD that we want to see occurring stop occurring.",229,,
1619,0.97,11072.861,11079.868,For instance we were looking at the precinct that serves West Seattle.,229,,
1620,0.97,11079.868,11084.373,I was on a call yesterday where folks were very worried that that was gonNA disappear.,229,,
1621,0.97,11084.373,11093.282,That we were just gonNA take--not define cuts.,229,,
1622,0.97,11093.282,11097.019,"And Council member Herbold, your staff represents communities, speaking to those concerns.",229,,
1623,0.97,11097.019,11106.695,And it's very important to me that we make sure that our policy objectives with these budget conversations are clearly defined.,229,,
1624,0.97,11106.695,11114.102,So there's no where SPK can make other policy decisions based on our behalf.,229,,
1625,0.97,11114.102,11116.605,"Well-Said, council member Strauss, thank you so much.",230,,
1626,0.97,11116.605,11134.923,"And I think that this document that you all have provided for us, the hard work that's gone into it, the presentation, the detailed analysis, the Well-Researched policy strategies, and funding strategies that you have identified answer part of conversations.",230,,
1627,0.97,11134.923,11145.033,"I want to make sure that anybody on this panel, if you have additional comment, you're gonNA wrap up here, and you are welcome to have the last word.",230,,
1628,0.97,11145.033,11145.934,Any additional comments?,230,,
1629,0.97,11145.934,11146.135,Okay.,230,,
1630,0.97,11146.135,11148.837,A huge amount of thanks and appreciation.,230,,
1631,0.97,11148.837,11152.741,I don't see any additional Collin members raising their hands to ask questions.,230,,
1632,0.97,11152.741,11160.782,I know everybody is very Preefshive of this detailed proposal.,230,,
1633,0.97,11160.782,11163.519,And this is gist the beginning of the conversation.,230,,
1634,0.97,11163.519,11166.054,We look forward to having more conversations with you.,230,,
1635,0.97,11166.054,11168.323,"Council President Gonzcez, please go ahead.",230,,
1636,0.97,11168.323,11169.157,Sorry.,231,,
1637,0.97,11169.157,11172.361,I've been sitting here wondering if I should say what I'm about to say.,231,,
1638,0.97,11172.361,11175.364,And I think I'm just gonNA say it.,231,,
1639,0.97,11175.364,11207.863,"I just want to say in closing to our friends on the panel that on behalf of the city, I just want to apologize for some of the recent rhetoric that we have been hearing around your longstanding and hard-fought efforts to get us to this point to be able to have a meaningful conversation about what it means today to Defund the police Department and to invest in Community-Driven solutions that we know work.",231,,
1640,0.97,11207.863,11240.395,And I just found the comments to be very patronizing of the expertise that the impacted community members and leaders in the--the expertise they have in communes to identify solutions and to do so Thankfully.,231,,
1641,0.97,11240.395,11246.835,And in a truly democratic way that engages community at the community level.,231,,
1642,0.97,11246.835,11249.738,As opposed to a Top-Down approach.,231,,
1643,0.97,11249.738,11259.181,So there's been a lot of criticism about how the city council is being Cavalier as it relates to this conversation.,231,,
1644,0.97,11259.181,11263.952,And the reality is that we're not being Cavalier.,231,,
1645,0.97,11263.952,11267.356,"We are truly responding to the calls from the community, to listen to community.",231,,
1646,0.97,11267.356,11268.857,Not just to hear you.,231,,
1647,0.97,11268.857,11273.929,But to actually listen and to follow your lead.,231,,
1648,0.97,11273.929,11288.81,And that means giving giving you the space and the time that you all need to coalesce around what a full detailed plan could and should look like for our consideration.,231,,
1649,0.97,11288.81,11301.99,We should all on this Council take the responsibility of listening to our constituent constituents.,231,,
1650,0.97,11301.99,11305.193,And allowing community members to formulate plans.,231,,
1651,0.97,11305.193,11306.094,"We, take that responsibility seriously.",231,,
1652,0.97,11306.094,11307.195,And I think this city council does.,231,,
1653,0.97,11307.195,11318.674,"And again, is it wasn't my rhetoric and it wasn't my word, but I do represent an agency that--and a city and institution that continues to perpetuate harm.",231,,
1654,0.97,11318.674,11331.386,"And for that, I just want acknowledge that I recognize that that kind of Divicive rhetoric is not helpful overall.",231,,
1655,0.97,11331.386,11339.428,We need to work together and to do that in a way that is actually feels authentic.,231,,
1656,0.97,11339.428,11344.766,So I am grateful that you all have taken time to pull together these detailed couples.,231,,
1657,0.97,11344.766,11349.638,I'm grateful that you're all spending time educating and talking to communities.,231,,
1658,0.97,11349.638,11353.742,Úand I am grateful Thaufr allowed us more of your personal time.,231,,
1659,0.97,11353.742,11355.744,In a committee hearing for the second time.,231,,
1660,0.97,11355.744,11358.346,And look forward to our ongoing work together.,231,,
1661,0.97,11358.346,11361.55,"Thank you, chair.",231,,
1662,0.97,11361.55,11363.018,"Thur, Madame President.",232,,
1663,0.97,11363.018,11376.732,I believe you speak on behalf of ll of us on Council expressing our appreciation for your time today.,232,,
1664,0.97,11376.732,11383.071,"Angelica, Isaac, Shawn, thank you.",232,,
1665,0.97,11383.071,11388.31,Thank you to Aretha Batu who has been working with a number you have and community organizations.,232,,
1666,0.97,11388.31,11390.312,Appreciate all of your time and the detailed presentation today.,232,,
1667,0.97,11390.312,11392.28,More to come.,232,,
1668,0.97,11392.28,11393.181,Thank you.,232,,
1669,0.97,11393.181,11396.752,"Council colleagues, we have one more follow-up item.",232,,
1670,0.97,11396.752,11403.458,"If I can turn it back over to Lisa and director Erstad, we are not required to go through each one of these bull points.",232,,
1671,0.97,11403.458,11407.095,The Council central staff has provided some slides for us.,232,,
1672,0.97,11407.095,11413.268,This is an opportunity if folks want to flag something as Council member Strauss said.,232,,
1673,0.97,11413.268,11416.705,One sentence is usually all that's allocated to issue identification.,232,,
1674,0.97,11416.705,11419.775,And a number of Council members have already sent in a few things.,232,,
1675,0.97,11419.775,11430.719,"If you as a council member have flagged something for central staff and you would like to take the next few minutes to identify or speak to an item or two, you are welcome to.",232,,
1676,0.97,11430.719,11434.523,My intent was to have us adjourn.,232,,
1677,0.97,11434.523,11437.826,No later than 6:00 PM.,232,,
1678,0.97,11437.826,11441.83,But I do want to leave by 5:30 if that's possible.,232,,
1679,0.97,11441.83,11450.105,"Lisa, Il turn it over to you.",232,,
1680,0.97,11450.105,11453.108,"Also Council colleague, if they would like to call out Ce items.",232,,
1681,0.97,11453.108,11455.11,They're more than welcome to.,232,,
1682,0.97,11455.11,11457.312,"Does that sound good, Lisa?",232,,
1683,0.97,11457.312,11459.314,"Yes, thank you so much, chair.",233,,
1684,0.97,11459.314,11464.853,"I am Lisa Kaye, with the central Straf.",233,,
1685,0.97,11464.853,11465.52,Central staff.,233,,
1686,0.97,11465.52,11474.796,We're going to show a few slides that represent some of the Council members' initial thinking about Pote amendments.,233,,
1687,0.97,11474.796,11478.767,These amendments are still very much in play.,233,,
1688,0.97,11478.767,11481.67,And are new in our preliminary concept.,233,,
1689,0.97,11481.67,11484.272,The Council members are working on more details.,233,,
1690,0.97,11484.272,11486.274,Some of them are preliminary ideas.,233,,
1691,0.97,11486.274,11490.979,So just be aware that's what you're looking at here.,233,,
1692,0.97,11490.979,11497.152,"Additional Info, we are--the slide will have a discussion of the potential amendment.",233,,
1693,0.97,11497.152,11505.961,Additional details are included in the relevant figure figures.,233,,
1694,0.97,11505.961,11507.896,Appendix a in the memo that you have.,233,,
1695,0.97,11507.896,11515.003,"If you want to read more about what is represented by that one sentence you, will be able to find that in the papers and materials.",233,,
1696,0.97,11515.003,11527.883,"Later this week, I think as the director mentioned, the Council will be submitting to central staff a more formal amendment that they want to discuss next week on the July 22nd and 23rd meeting.",233,,
1697,0.97,11527.883,11530.418,Those Ma'Ams will need to be Self-Balancing.,233,,
1698,0.97,11530.418,11534.122,And those will be more formally addressed.,233,,
1699,0.97,11534.122,11535.323,Throughout the following weeks.,233,,
1700,0.97,11535.323,11554.709,"So Patty, you can go ahead and start with these listed backward from D-7 to D-1.",233,,
1701,0.97,11556.111,11563.318,"Patty, you can go ahead and go to the next slide.",233,,
1702,0.97,11563.318,11563.518,Thur.,233,,
1703,0.97,11563.518,11569.758,"I will turn it over to the Council members to speak, should they wish.",233,,
1704,0.97,11569.758,11572.16,"Thank you so much, Lisa.",234,,
1705,0.97,11572.16,11586.141,I'm gonNA be super brief.,234,,
1706,0.97,11586.141,11592.881,Definitely interested in some kind of process to development a Community-Based 9-1-1 response system.,234,,
1707,0.97,11592.881,11595.617,The Department of public safety discussion.,234,,
1708,0.97,11595.617,11600.588,That has sort of come out of some discussions with Greg.,234,,
1709,0.97,11600.588,11610.298,And looking at a couple of other examples around the country of initiatives that tend to involve chatter changes that some cities are pursuing or have pursued.,234,,
1710,0.97,11610.298,11618.807,Particular be a potential way to house a lot of the public Safety-Related functions that we want to protect and expand.,234,,
1711,0.97,11618.807,11625.113,But not keep within the SPD chain of command.,234,,
1712,0.97,11625.113,11629.718,9-1-1 dispatch could potentially be one of those things.,234,,
1713,0.97,11629.718,11642.998,"If service officers, folks that have the power to do citations, but not the power of arrest.",234,,
1714,0.97,11642.998,11644.132,Or That'Smed personnel.,234,,
1715,0.97,11644.132,11646.935,Essentially the idea of knowing around how that would work.,234,,
1716,0.97,11646.935,11656.044,Many of the forces pursuing a chatter amendment that would essentially create a civilian Department of public safety.,234,,
1717,0.97,11656.044,11659.214,That would have basically a armed Department within it.,234,,
1718,0.97,11659.214,11663.218,"That would be headed by, like, a chief of police.",234,,
1719,0.97,11663.218,11665.654,Bithey would be subordinate to a civilian director.,234,,
1720,0.97,11665.654,11667.856,And there would be multiple other serves.,234,,
1721,0.97,11667.856,11668.656,That's a potential model.,234,,
1722,0.97,11668.656,11676.131,I think this is probably a longer conferring than the summer session.,234,,
1723,0.97,11676.131,11681.336,And something that would probably involve putting together potential chatter amendments.,234,,
1724,0.97,11681.336,11691.579,Probably for the general election in next year's--the 2021 general election.,234,,
1725,0.97,11691.579,11693.782,Those are some of the initial things right now.,234,,
1726,0.97,11693.782,11698.053,And I'm happy to have future discussions about them.,234,,
1727,0.97,11698.053,11701.222,"Thank you, council member Lewis.",235,,
1728,0.97,11701.222,11703.491,No questions.,235,,
1729,0.97,11703.491,11705.794,Please continue.,235,,
1730,0.97,11705.794,11715.77,"Thank you, Patty.",236,,
1731,0.97,11715.77,11718.139,"Council member, I'll turn this over to you.",236,,
1732,0.97,11718.139,11718.606,"Great, thank you.",237,,
1733,0.97,11718.606,11733.321,"When I was looking at this budget, I looked specifically at the departments that are under the Purview of my committee.",237,,
1734,0.97,11733.321,11737.926,"When I was looking at this, there were three items that jumped out to me.",237,,
1735,0.97,11737.926,11747.569,Restoring the funding for the one-time funding for the comprehensive plan.,237,,
1736,0.97,11747.569,11748.136,Major updates.,237,,
1737,0.97,11748.136,11749.237,This doesn't happen often.,237,,
1738,0.97,11749.237,11753.007,I'm not sure I will bring amendments for all three of these issues.,237,,
1739,0.97,11753.007,11754.008,Taking one step back.,237,,
1740,0.97,11754.008,11764.052,"This first one is in OPC's budget to fund the environmental impact statement work for the 2023 comprehensive plan major update, as well as a community outreach and engagement work.",237,,
1741,0.97,11764.052,11772.894,The legislature pushed our deadline for the COMP plan update to 2024.,237,,
1742,0.97,11772.894,11782.871,Council has taken steps in recent budgets thanks to the council member's engagement in the community around this update.,237,,
1743,0.97,11782.871,11789.878,"And given the state of extension, it is important that removing this funding may be appropriate now.",237,,
1744,0.97,11789.878,11796.351,But it's important to me that we receive Shaurns from the executive that this funding would be restored next year.,237,,
1745,0.97,11796.351,11804.092,The second one is restore the one-time funding for transition and perpetration of Edu materials.,237,,
1746,0.97,11804.092,11812.7,"This is only a $15,000 budget line item.",237,,
1747,0.97,11812.7,11820.909,And it would have a large all of knack because we're putting English-Only information into many different languages.,237,,
1748,0.97,11820.909,11827.916,So not just primarily English speakers are understanding how you can build an Adu at your house.,237,,
1749,0.97,11827.916,11830.919,"And because laws changed recently, that's the importance of this.",237,,
1750,0.97,11830.919,11834.389,And it's a low-cost item with a high impact.,237,,
1751,0.97,11834.389,11841.429,The last one is retaining a position in appropriation for term limited electrical inspector.,237,,
1752,0.97,11841.429,11853.208,"Last year at the request of Iduw, council allocated funding to SBCI for an electrical Inspector this position is no longer funded in the Mayor's proposed Rebalanced budget.",237,,
1753,0.97,11853.208,11860.248,And I'd be interested in having a conversation with everyone who push for this last year to see if this is an appropriate cut or not.,237,,
1754,0.97,11860.248,11877.966,I'm sure they will have many other ideas one I look at the other departments.,237,,
1755,0.97,11882.637,11883.004,"Thank you, counsel.",237,,
1756,0.97,11883.304,11889.41,"Thank you, council member Strauss for flagging these issues.",238,,
1757,0.97,11889.41,11894.782,"All right, next slide.",238,,
1758,0.97,11894.782,11903.391,"I should also NOTE--go ahead, council member Pedersen.",238,,
1759,0.97,11903.391,11907.495,"For folks, feel free to say any other items that are also not listed there.",238,,
1760,0.97,11907.495,11911.532,But this is not--does not have to be all-inclusive.,238,,
1761,0.97,11911.532,11916.004,Just sort of an initial high-level Heads-Up to colleagues.,238,,
1762,0.97,11916.004,11917.305,"Council member Pedersen, please.",238,,
1763,0.97,11917.305,11919.974,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,239,,
1764,0.97,11919.974,11928.483,"Similar to Council member Strauss, that first look at the rebalancing package from the Úmayor was through the lens of the committee that I chair.",239,,
1765,0.97,11928.483,11938.693,There are obviously a lot of important matters we're dealing with in public safety that this first wave was just a look at the items Impacting my committee.,239,,
1766,0.97,11938.693,11943.731,I may have more items from my committee or changes that I'd like to make.,239,,
1767,0.97,11943.731,11969.557,"One of the things that popped out when reviewing the rebalancing package from the Mayor, my desire to amend it to reject the Mayor's proposal to pause vital work on the sorely needed sidewalks and Crosswalks to safely connect 1,000 Lambeau fielding residents of Mag Nuszen park along the Sos northeast.",239,,
1768,0.97,11969.557,11975.463,I was surprised and Sdointed to see this proposal from Sdot to pause this.,239,,
1769,0.97,11975.463,11979.634,These sidewalks and Crosswalks are needed now to meet vision zero safety goals.,239,,
1770,0.97,11979.634,11982.27,As well as our safe routes to school program.,239,,
1771,0.97,11982.27,11986.074,Helping to connect dozens of children to sand point way elementary school.,239,,
1772,0.97,11986.074,11995.984,It will also help connect the scores of cyclists Biking from the trail to the park.,239,,
1773,0.97,11995.984,12004.592,Funds can be found in the unreserved fund balance between the school's safety traffic investment improvement Fund.,239,,
1774,0.97,12004.592,12012.9,"This amendment to the rebalancing package is about safety for pedestrians, safety for cyclists.",239,,
1775,0.97,12012.9,12015.303,"Connecting 1,000 residents to their neighbors.",239,,
1776,0.97,12015.303,12021.476,Safely enhancing access to this regional aspect that the park.,239,,
1777,0.97,12021.476,12028.282,"These are Community-Driven projects supported by all the neighborhoods, there as well as the park advisory committee.",239,,
1778,0.97,12028.282,12031.219,These diverse collaborative groups have been advocating for thee Combrums for years.,239,,
1779,0.97,12031.219,12037.325,I had first learned about these projects years ago when I was a legislative aide.,239,,
1780,0.97,12037.325,12041.662,"So the pause is totally unacceptable to me, and we'll be putting forward an amendment to reverse that.",239,,
1781,0.97,12041.662,12044.365,Thank you.,239,,
1782,0.97,12044.365,12049.003,"Thur, council member Pedersen.",240,,
1783,0.97,12049.003,12049.437,Next slide.,240,,
1784,0.97,12049.437,12051.372,"Thank you, council member Sawant.",240,,
1785,0.97,12051.372,12053.341,I know this is one of two Lides.,240,,
1786,0.97,12053.341,12061.716,"If you want to highlight it for us, that would be great.",240,,
1787,0.97,12061.716,12063.317,Yes.,241,,
1788,0.97,12063.317,12066.721,The first I'm happy Stobring that forward.,241,,
1789,0.97,12066.721,12076.564,"But as I said this morning, with the amendment that was brought forward this morning was to pass, then it would be an important step forward.",241,,
1790,0.97,12076.564,12081.669,And maybe this would not be necessary.,241,,
1791,0.97,12081.669,12094.582,So we'll see what to do about this one.,241,,
1792,0.97,12094.582,12104.525,This budget amendment would provide that no Funs should be used to remove the Northwest.,241,,
1793,0.97,12104.525,12117.038,"Perhaps for the fourth time this year, and public support despite the dangers and absurdities of eliminating the tiny House during the middle of a pandemic and homeless emergencies.",241,,
1794,0.97,12117.038,12120.975,There is only a complete extension of a couple months at a time.,241,,
1795,0.97,12120.975,12130.618,And the residents are saying imagine spending years being told that you'll be evicted from your rental home in a month or two.,241,,
1796,0.97,12130.618,12132.487,So their latest Eviction date is August first.,241,,
1797,0.97,12132.487,12134.222,And it is totally unacceptable to me.,241,,
1798,0.97,12134.222,12139.127,And I hope the Council--all Council members will support it.,241,,
1799,0.97,12139.127,12161.048,"In a similar vein, cutting the money from the Numberigation team, as part of stopping this Infefktive and inhumane policing of homeless Encampments, we direct those folks to programs that actually work.",241,,
1800,0.97,12161.048,12162.55,The navigation team.,241,,
1801,0.97,12162.55,12171.058,We want to make sure that the funds are directed toward something that actually works for our homeless community members.,241,,
1802,0.97,12171.058,12180.268,We're starting off funding for green new deal oversight board also extremely important.,241,,
1803,0.97,12180.268,12183.571,This is again--hitting the oversight board last fall.,241,,
1804,0.97,12183.571,12189.41,"And the Mayor has done everything in her power, unfortunately, to prevent it from being created.",241,,
1805,0.97,12189.41,12200.855,The oversight board is a body to fight the city in the green new deal.,241,,
1806,0.97,12200.855,12207.595,"Represent environmental activists, communities, and has a mandate to make recommendations of the city budget.",241,,
1807,0.97,12207.595,12214.468,Unfortunately the Mayor refused to advertise for open positions despite repeated inquiries.,241,,
1808,0.97,12214.468,12219.273,And refused to appoint people until a staff focus to be hired.,241,,
1809,0.97,12219.273,12221.909,I think this is unacceptable.,241,,
1810,0.97,12221.909,12237.291,And also keeping in mind that it is a small amount of money in this budget amendment to restore the funding to remove any barriers to not appointing the people to allow the board to begin its work.,241,,
1811,0.97,12237.291,12244.665,"I think the next one, extremely crucial.",241,,
1812,0.97,12244.665,12258.646,"This would increase funding for organizes like the City-Funned attorneys that provide the Eviction defense for Renters Facingy, Vikzs.",241,,
1813,0.97,12258.646,12259.947,It's a do-or-die difference.,241,,
1814,0.97,12259.947,12263.851,You have trained attorneys defending them.,241,,
1815,0.97,12263.851,12269.757,And we have seen how it has actually had an impact.,241,,
1816,0.97,12269.757,12273.127,"Three years ago, the city funded the first attorney.",241,,
1817,0.97,12273.127,12275.029,And then increase today to two attorneys last year.,241,,
1818,0.97,12275.029,12276.864,We know it is working.,241,,
1819,0.97,12276.864,12282.57,We have multiple Council members acknowledging what is going to be an avalanche or a Tsuna Evictions.,241,,
1820,0.97,12282.57,12282.97,It's coming.,241,,
1821,0.97,12282.97,12294.682,"It's not going to be enough, but this will be an essential part of funding, the prevention of Eviction.",241,,
1822,0.97,12294.682,12304.592,"And also we have an executive Takeout $100,000 with the budget amendment to pay the city executives, directors of the departments.",241,,
1823,0.97,12304.592,12312.433,Positions like that at no more than 115K per year.,241,,
1824,0.97,12312.433,12313.834,We brought this amendment forward.,241,,
1825,0.97,12313.834,12316.57,Year after year the Council has not supported it.,241,,
1826,0.97,12316.57,12335.923,"It is particularly important this year as the city's present layoffs and for you lows, and we don't believe it's once Online for executives to be making very, very high salaries when we're telling our rank and file workers to take Mand Taer Furloughs or to be laid off.",241,,
1827,0.97,12335.923,12338.159,"And Lastly, I mentioned this in the morning.",241,,
1828,0.97,12338.159,12349.203,"We want to make sure that there is a proviso to prohibit the police Department and the Mayor's office from using these funds to prosecute Bwell, M protestors.",241,,
1829,0.97,12349.203,12361.749,And there's a lot to be said about the criminal justice system but that's a start.,241,,
1830,0.97,12361.749,12363.851,And yes.,242,,
1831,0.97,12363.851,12365.419,So we had an organizational change.,242,,
1832,0.97,12365.419,12379.667,"Contact my office with the proposal that is being put forward here to explain that the work is Kecked for homeless service workers during the Covid emergency, especially.",242,,
1833,0.97,12379.667,12393.881,"And why parking enforcement was suspended, it allows people working with vulnerable populations to be much more efficient because they don't need to worry about two-hour parking restricts.",242,,
1834,0.97,12393.881,12406.66,"Now that those Flexibilities were removed, it is causing massive problems for the workers whose service is actually critical for the most Vubl communities during the Covid pandemic.",242,,
1835,0.97,12406.66,12419.006,So this allows other people who are working on this to continue to disregard parking restrictions.,242,,
1836,0.97,12419.006,12424.979,"Then the hiring freeze in the office of labor standard, I've talked about this many times.",242,,
1837,0.97,12424.979,12441.896,Workers facing violation of their pay are sometimes waiting over a year to have the city to even look at their C effect on their wages.,242,,
1838,0.97,12441.896,12442.196,Unremedied.,242,,
1839,0.97,12442.196,12447.301,And that's just one of the laws that the Department looks into.,242,,
1840,0.97,12447.301,12461.949,"And then of course the City-Related amendment as I mentioned before making sure that the departments, this year's budget is cut back approximately 20%.",242,,
1841,0.97,12461.949,12471.058,"And if they're spending money, it's up to them to figure out how they're going to function in the context of a 50% cut because that is extremely important for us to do.",242,,
1842,0.97,12471.058,12481.869,And of course we have to absolutely stop the--again the Council has refused to do this.,242,,
1843,0.97,12481.869,12484.171,We need to stop this this year.,242,,
1844,0.97,12484.171,12485.973,There's a movement demanding it.,242,,
1845,0.97,12485.973,12494.748,And we need to stop the Presenters told us just now that we also want to stop the treatment of homeless individual and our Hom neighbors.,242,,
1846,0.97,12494.748,12499.587,"And if you remember, we are in a pandemic.",242,,
1847,0.97,12499.587,12506.16,"So that alongside, remember, salaries and overtime of the Seattle police Department is.",242,,
1848,0.97,12507.795,12511.999,"Thank you, council member Sawant.",243,,
1849,0.97,12511.999,12514.068,Council member Morales?,243,,
1850,0.97,12514.068,12516.57,I know that you have one of four slides here.,243,,
1851,0.97,12516.57,12522.309,"If there is a handful that you'd like to draw our attention to, please do.",243,,
1852,0.97,12522.309,12524.678,Otherwise we are all ears for your priority.,243,,
1853,0.97,12524.678,12528.716,Let us know what you'd like us to look at.,243,,
1854,0.97,12528.716,12535.189,This is long because I will say there is a long list of proposed cuts that we got Decriminalize Seattle.,244,,
1855,0.97,12535.189,12540.327,I submitted each one separately as an idea.,244,,
1856,0.97,12540.327,12542.696,That is probably what most of this list is.,244,,
1857,0.97,12542.696,12550.07,And I'm happy to talk with Council members if Y'all want to work together on something.,244,,
1858,0.97,12550.07,12554.141,Or--one of them is the 9-1-1 issue.,244,,
1859,0.97,12554.141,12556.51,"So Council member Lewis, if you want to divide things up, that's fine.",244,,
1860,0.97,12556.51,12564.451,I just want to make sure that they are out there as issues for us to consider.,244,,
1861,0.97,12564.451,12571.825,We have several around the navigation team removing the police from permanent assignment there.,244,,
1862,0.97,12571.825,12577.598,And really just cutting the navigation team entirely and getting those serves out to the commune.,244,,
1863,0.97,12577.598,12580.668,That's what most of these are going to be about.,244,,
1864,0.97,12580.668,12586.874,And then we do have a couple that I do want to call out.,244,,
1865,0.97,12586.874,12600.688,One is to restore funding to the office of civil rights for a mediator position as we talk about the need for enforcement and investigations and for that Department in particular in this moment in time to be fully Resourced.,244,,
1866,0.97,12600.688,12609.897,This is not the time to be cutting anything from that Department.,244,,
1867,0.97,12609.897,12628.415,Then I would love to have conversations with folks with Childcare assistance programs and the plan to increase capacity there.,244,,
1868,0.97,12628.415,12630.084,Ands everybody can look through them.,244,,
1869,0.97,12630.084,12647.201,Most of these are about SPD and how we start moving toward shifting this funding out into the community.,244,,
1870,0.97,12647.201,12649.203,"Thank you, council member Morales.",245,,
1871,0.97,12649.203,12654.241,I know that was a truncated summary of a long list of priorities.,245,,
1872,0.97,12654.241,12656.243,We really appreciate having you folks here.,245,,
1873,0.97,12656.243,12658.412,Pausing to see if there's any questions.,245,,
1874,0.97,12658.412,12664.151,I'm sure that folks will follow up with you as you offered to work together on a number of these pieces.,245,,
1875,0.97,12664.151,12668.622,Thank you for listing all of these in the central staff for their work on those in advance.,245,,
1876,0.97,12668.622,12669.056,Okay.,245,,
1877,0.97,12669.056,12675.329,I think we have Council member Herbold last.,245,,
1878,0.97,12675.329,12676.163,Thank you.,246,,
1879,0.97,12676.163,12679.867,So I had a couple pages here.,246,,
1880,0.97,12679.867,12690.077,Some of them related to the Decriminalize se requests.,246,,
1881,0.97,12690.077,12698.585,The first is a request for funding to Actualize a recommendation out of the city attorney's office.,246,,
1882,0.97,12698.585,12708.195,And the city council last year requested this report from the city attorney led by Council President Gonzcez.,246,,
1883,0.97,12708.195,12712.9,With a slide requesting that the city attorney report to the Council regarding recommendation.,246,,
1884,0.97,12712.9,12718.972,The Reentry Workgroup specifically to expand the Prefiling diversion program to those who are age 25 or older.,246,,
1885,0.97,12718.972,12726.98,As part of the city attorney's reply to the request of funding to conduct a racial equity Toolkit.,246,,
1886,0.97,12726.98,12747.801,"Funding would be used to Koch Sate Stakeholders they engage with and provide resources like food, Daycare, and possible fees for engagement site sites.",246,,
1887,0.97,12747.801,12756.643,1 of the bullets listed on this slide is actually from the Decriminalize Seattle's reputations for spending.,246,,
1888,0.97,12756.643,12764.551,To add additional rental assistance to people experiencing homelessness.,246,,
1889,0.97,12764.551,12783.27,We've got a proviso that I'm working with Council member Morales on to limit spending of appropriations for the lead program to allow for referrals without requiring law enforcement prior approval.,246,,
1890,0.97,12783.27,12787.975,Where we're working on two possible approaches.,246,,
1891,0.97,12787.975,12794.481,The change recognizes that there is a significantly changed set of Sishgdzs in which lead and Colead is currently operating.,246,,
1892,0.97,12794.481,12801.355,And by allowing for a third Pathway to referrals to lead.,246,,
1893,0.97,12801.355,12810.097,From Nonlaw enforcement resources without actually requiring SPD to sign off on those.,246,,
1894,0.97,12810.097,12813.333,We can actually act on those referrals due to ongoing capacity issues.,246,,
1895,0.97,12813.333,12817.938,"The police Department has been unable to full this function for many, many weeks.",246,,
1896,0.97,12817.938,12830.984,"And the result is that lead's rare resources like specialized case management, individual Hotel/Motel rooms, they're going unused even while there's a growing need and urgent demand.",246,,
1897,0.97,12830.984,12842.829,We understand that chief Carmen best is actually in favor of allowing this third Pathway of referrals by removing the police Department from the Gatekeeping function.,246,,
1898,0.97,12842.829,12845.132,And we are continuing to work on the exact language.,246,,
1899,0.97,12845.132,12867.454,"As it relates specifically to the SPD related amendments, as the central staff memo notes, the cuts below as well as the ads are kind of representing the potential universe of cuts that I've seen that could be made to the police Department.",246,,
1900,0.97,12867.454,12868.922,They are not specific proposals at this point.,246,,
1901,0.97,12868.922,12885.572,I would like to work with my colleagues in getting a sense of what cuts there is support for on the Council before developing amendments to represent these cuts.,246,,
1902,0.97,12885.572,12892.879,"The proposal includes, of course, the cuts proposed by the Mayor for 2020.",246,,
1903,0.97,12892.879,12894.581,That $20 million.,246,,
1904,0.97,12894.581,12899.486,It includes cuts proposed by Decriminalize Seattle and King County equity now.,246,,
1905,0.97,12899.486,12906.693,Some of the cuts could include shifting work to other areas outside of SPD.,246,,
1906,0.97,12906.693,12912.432,"Could include as has been proposed by other Council member, replacing 9-1-1 with a Civilian-Led system.",246,,
1907,0.97,12912.432,12918.472,The Mayor is proposing to do the same for 2021.,246,,
1908,0.97,12918.472,12931.785,I think the Council action now indicating our support for that and allocating resources necessary to begin that work is definitely appropriate.,246,,
1909,0.97,12931.785,12940.627,I have identified a desired target of $68 million in cuts phased from September through December.,246,,
1910,0.97,12940.627,12956.41,This would be an approach where not all the cuts would come out of the budget in September but would be phased in a way that is sequential to both when we could realize the cuts.,246,,
1911,0.97,12956.41,12964.518,And also sequential to when the need for the corresponding spending occurs over the next four months.,246,,
1912,0.97,12964.518,12976.063,And we've got central staff looking into whether or not we can actually technically and Logistically do a phased cut approach.,246,,
1913,0.97,12976.063,12989.776,"The proposals suggest that we fund Community-Led alternatives to policing, some of which Seattle is already doing, like Prearrest dive.",246,,
1914,0.97,12989.776,12997.351,Focused SPD office activity on their areas of law enforcement expertise.,246,,
1915,0.97,12997.351,13003.657,I often refer to the quote from the Dallas police chief.,246,,
1916,0.97,13003.657,13005.192,Chief Brown.,246,,
1917,0.97,13005.192,13017.738,Where he laments the fact that officers are being asked to address sort of every societal failure.,246,,
1918,0.97,13017.738,13019.206,And putting those responsibilities on police officers to solve.,246,,
1919,0.97,13019.206,13032.219,And I don't think that actually is resulting in improved public safety Outcomecomes.,246,,
1920,0.97,13032.219,13047.167,So the cuts do include a potential reduction in--too certain functions that we've already identified.,246,,
1921,0.97,13047.167,13053.84,I think as functions that Maeven us do not want SPD to be continuing.,246,,
1922,0.97,13053.84,13059.78,Including their participation on the navigation team.,246,,
1923,0.97,13059.78,13064.351,Including their activities as school resource officers.,246,,
1924,0.97,13064.351,13073.627,So those are potential cuts that might have labor implications.,246,,
1925,0.97,13073.627,13094.381,"And that, I think, is--what I have to say about the issue that I've done here, I do want to--before I give up the Mic here, impress a little bit of consternation that we are gonNA be able to go from this moment around issue I.D.",246,,
1926,0.97,13094.381,13100.487,On particular--particularly on the P items.,246,,
1927,0.97,13100.487,13103.557,And turn around Maechlds.,246,,
1928,0.97,13103.557,13109.896,Central staff Greg Doss has asked to receive our amendments today.,246,,
1929,0.97,13109.896,13115.001,And I just don't know how.,246,,
1930,0.97,13115.001,13123.777,"And in his defense, he needs that information so that he can develop it for next week.",246,,
1931,0.97,13123.777,13128.815,And I'm very aware of what the goals are.,246,,
1932,0.97,13128.815,13132.586,And what we're all trying to do together.,246,,
1933,0.97,13132.586,13145.732,But I am concerned that I don't have a good sense of which cuts I want to recommend at this point to give central staff direction.,246,,
1934,0.97,13145.732,13153.607,And I'm wondering out loud here as I recognize what's before us what our options might be.,246,,
1935,0.97,13153.607,13156.61,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",247,,
1936,0.97,13156.61,13160.747,Both for going over your slides and also for asking that question.,247,,
1937,0.97,13160.747,13163.65,I am interested in following up with Greg as well.,247,,
1938,0.97,13163.65,13174.494,I know that we have some initial on the back of the envelope numbers to potentially go along with the presentation today.,247,,
1939,0.97,13174.494,13177.063,Both interested in that analysis based on some of the initial numbers.,247,,
1940,0.97,13177.063,13190.277,And I believe one thing that we should consider doing is Pausing just that sort of backbone of the various Spd-Level reductions that folks were interested in seeing.,247,,
1941,0.97,13190.277,13196.883,Having just is that one document identified as a way for us to have potential amendments.,247,,
1942,0.97,13196.883,13204.291,And then possibly having various Council members take on Soinlts for certain sections of those.,247,,
1943,0.97,13204.291,13208.228,So many Council members including yourself have already shown leadership and interest in certain areas.,247,,
1944,0.97,13208.228,13216.503,And I know that there is a possibly for us to sort of divide up the possible amendments that are possible in the next two weeks.,247,,
1945,0.97,13216.503,13222.475,And have Council members consider leaving those sections of the proposal that we just heard about.,247,,
1946,0.97,13222.475,13224.778,What can be done in the next two weeks.,247,,
1947,0.97,13224.778,13230.116,"If you don't mind, I'll follow up with Greg Doss Offline.",247,,
1948,0.97,13230.116,13234.821,"And also the Presenters, including organizational members who have been thinking about reaching out to folks.",247,,
1949,0.97,13234.821,13236.056,I see Council member Pedersen on the line.,247,,
1950,0.97,13236.056,13239.826,We have had a lot of conversations about alternatives to 9-1-1 as well.,247,,
1951,0.97,13239.826,13249.336,So Maybe there's bits and pieces that various Council members are already thinking of that correspond nicely with some of the information that we've seen.,247,,
1952,0.97,13249.336,13254.641,"And with that, we also still have a hand from Shawn listening in.",247,,
1953,0.97,13254.641,13258.845,Looking forward to following occupy that presentation to make sure those pieces are analyzed.,247,,
1954,0.97,13258.845,13265.752,And to the extent we can get Council members assigned to various pieces that are interested in these.,247,,
1955,0.97,13265.752,13266.019,Okay.,247,,
1956,0.97,13266.019,13278.565,I don't have really anything else to say on the next slide except for I think it would be no surprise that I continue to say we need to get folks out of Congr shelters.,247,,
1957,0.97,13278.565,13282.769,Who are contracting Covid because of heightened health compensations already are dying.,247,,
1958,0.97,13282.769,13291.978,"And that's not good for their health, the folks' health in congregate shelter, and the overall health of our community as we think about the need for overall population health.",247,,
1959,0.97,13291.978,13293.647,More to come on that.,247,,
1960,0.97,13293.647,13297.25,I believe that's the end of the presentation.,247,,
1961,0.97,13297.25,13298.585,Is that correct?,247,,
1962,0.97,13298.585,13299.586,Yes.,248,,
1963,0.97,13299.586,13300.387,Okay.,249,,

1965,0.97,13303.59,13307.761,And a handful of Council members who I know are thinking of other amendments.,249,,
1966,0.97,13307.761,13309.796,You did not have to flag those today.,249,,
1967,0.97,13309.796,13311.898,You are welcome to.,249,,
1968,0.97,13311.898,13314.801,We appreciate all those folks who described something already.,249,,
1969,0.97,13314.801,13323.41,"If there are any closing comments for the good of the order or things that didn't get a chance to be said, now is the time.",249,,
1970,0.97,13323.41,13343.329,"Seeing no hands going up, only Thumbs-Up at this point, I want to say how much we appreciate central staff for walking through this presentation with us.",249,,
1971,0.97,13343.329,13346.7,"Communications, clerk's office, and each of our individual offices.",249,,
1972,0.97,13346.7,13350.403,The Council President just sent a very nice NOTE out to the entire staff.,249,,
1973,0.97,13350.403,13356.042,I Jipted to thank her for those words of encouragement as well.,249,,
1974,0.97,13356.042,13365.819,We know these are very stressful times and you are doing incredible work to make sure we can lift up the priorities of Council and put those into action in the next two weeks.,249,,
1975,0.97,13365.819,13378.064,"Because we had such an incredible panel, I just want to say one more time, thank you.",249,,
1976,0.97,13378.064,13380.367,Much more to come between now and the next meeting.,249,,
1977,0.97,13380.367,13385.672,"The next meeting for us for the select budget committee is Wednesday, at 2:00 PM.",249,,
1978,0.97,13385.672,13389.776,Because we have a very important land use meeting in the morning.,249,,
