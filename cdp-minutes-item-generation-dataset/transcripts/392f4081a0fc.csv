23,0.97,162.162,181.481,"Before I hand this over to Deel, I want to make a note we would Normall have central staff at the table, Brian is the policy analyst assigned to this issue but unfortunately he is away from the office attending to a personal matter and will be back until I believe 10 December.",7,,
24,0.97,181.481,199.933,He did however let my office Knw he worked with Deel in the background to address technical issues ahead of transmittal of this legislation that we are about to be briefed on and discuss.,7,,
25,0.97,199.933,206.039,And he and his due diligence did evaluate the proposed legislation after the technical issues were addressed and identified no other policy issues.,7,,
26,0.97,206.039,213.146,From central staff's perspective related to this.,7,,
27,0.97,213.146,221.421,"Without further Ado, I'm going to go ahead and handed over to director Dwane Chappelle to kickoff the conversation.",7,,
28,0.97,221.421,227.56,Director Chapelle has a presentation and he's going to Queue it up.,7,,

31,0.97,244.644,246.179,"All right thank you, Council President.",8,,

36,0.97,267.533,274.574,"So once again, Council president and all Council members.",8,,
37,0.97,274.574,287.687,"The purpose of today's presentation is to walk you through the executive proposal, or should I say proposed legislation amending the Fepp evaluation plan in response to bid.",8,,
38,0.97,287.687,289.288,"Next slide, please.",8,,
39,0.97,289.288,301.501,The reason we are bringing this before you is because there is existing legislation that governs how the Fepp proceeds may be spent.,8,,
40,0.97,301.501,315.348,"These include the original ordinance was approved by voters in November 2018, and the Fepp implementation evaluates the plan which was adopted by Council in April 2019.",8,,
41,0.97,315.348,329.529,"The ordinance that created the Fepp specifies strategies that funds can be spent on, implementation and evaluation plans also specify some key program details and changes that require Council engagement.",8,,
42,0.97,329.529,340.039,Neither of the ordinances considered the fact that a global pandemic would occur within our seven years of this levy.,8,,
43,0.97,340.039,352.285,"Therefore, we are doing, is proposing legislation for these circumstances, that respond to the circumstances, and they are consistent with the ordinance.",8,,
44,0.97,352.285,358.591,We have engaged our Fepp levy on-site Committee on the proposed legislation here before you.,8,,
45,0.97,358.591,364.263,And we have also included a letter that includes their support.,8,,
46,0.97,364.263,367.066,"Next slide, please.",8,,
47,0.97,367.066,387.52,"So, Deel and our partners have done a lot of work in response to the pandemic, from Lansing launching emergency Childcare programs to modifying all of our Department investments to meet the public health guidance.",8,,
48,0.97,387.52,390.49,"And, we have kept children, youth and family at the center of all of it.",8,,
49,0.97,390.49,399.966,"So this legislation, it acknowledges prior actions that were taken by Deel in response to the pandemic, and also it addresses emergent community needs.",8,,
50,0.97,399.966,411.411,"So I'm going to do now is turn this over to our interim director, Marissa Rousselle, interim director of policy and communications as I mentioned earlier.",8,,
51,0.97,411.411,416.115,To review the proposed amendments with you all.,8,,
52,0.97,416.115,416.716,Thank you.,9,,
53,0.97,416.716,427.059,"Next slide, please.",9,,
54,0.97,429.295,439.972,"Great, so the Addendum for consideration today, as mentioned has been considered by our levy oversight committee.",9,,
55,0.97,439.972,449.749,Going to wait for this next slide to come up.,9,,
56,0.97,449.749,451.651,Great.,9,,
57,0.97,451.651,470.303,"And so, we just want to state as an Overarching description of the proposal that the actions taken are consistent with the goals of the Fepp levy is adopted by Council and approved by voters.",9,,
58,0.97,470.303,473.372,All of our actions are consistent with the latest public health guidance and state mandates.,9,,
59,0.97,473.372,494.093,"And, in bringing forth these policy recommendations, Deel was very intentional about balancing students, family and's service provider needs and all modifications we have made in response to Covid, those partners have been at the forefront of our thinking.",9,,
60,0.97,494.093,495.828,"Next slide, please.",9,,
61,0.97,495.828,506.038,"So, in the attached Addendum, Addendum number three, we have included language that specifies the Timeframe that this policy will be in effect.",9,,
62,0.97,506.038,522.021,"And so we are proposing for these measures to apply only to the current school year of Fepp investment, Fepp year two, the flexibility granted would and August 31 2021.",9,,
63,0.97,522.021,526.559,"Unless, we continue to grapple with the Covid pandemic.",9,,
64,0.97,526.559,540.573,"And so we have included language in the legislation that says if King County remains in phases one, two, three on July 1 then the flexibility in this legislation to extend through your three.",9,,
65,0.97,540.573,551.751,Rationale behind this is that Deel begins working on her contracts with partners in the spring.,9,,
66,0.97,551.751,552.785,For the upcoming school year.,9,,
67,0.97,552.785,566.132,So we want to make sure we have enough time to be responsive to her partner's needs and to get families enough notice of any policy changes that will continue into the next school year.,9,,
68,0.97,566.132,580.98,"For any changes made as a result of this legislation, we will notify the chair of this committee within 30 days and we will also include a list of any modifications as a result of the legislation in our Fepp year two annual report.",9,,
69,0.97,580.98,585.885,"I also want to note that the legislation includes a ratify and confirm clause effective September 1, 2020.",9,,
70,0.97,585.885,597.897,This is because some of the modifications requested are already in place as the school year is almost halfway done.,9,,
71,0.97,597.897,603.302,"So, we want to be responsive to those changes we had to make expeditiously as we built a response to the pandemic.",9,,
72,0.97,603.302,608.107,Next slide.,9,,
73,0.97,608.107,621.821,"Okay, and so here is a summary of the bullet points and Addendum number three, we have just gone ahead and included the full text from that attachment here for you.",9,,
74,0.97,621.821,633.332,"For those of you who may not recall, the Fepp levy has four investment areas, early learning, K-12, school health, and Seattle promised.",9,,
75,0.97,633.332,656.756,"These first two bullet points are intended to be expensive to cover all the investments in the Fepp levy, to give Deel ability to adapt in accordance with public health mandates across all four areas and to expand the Fepp strategies we are allowed to invest in to meet emerging community needs.",9,,
76,0.97,656.756,673.205,For the remainder of deals in the presentation today you will hear from early learning director and our secondary director who are going to speak about the amendments pertaining to Seattle preschool program and Seattle promised program.,9,,
77,0.97,673.205,684.016,I will leave it and turn over to Monaco to talk about the Seattle preschool program.,9,,
78,0.97,684.016,694.226,Great.,10,,
79,0.97,694.393,722.154,"So as you know early learning has been at the forefront of the fight in this pandemic, really responding very quickly to the emergent needs of essential workers, as you know, and we are grateful to our learning providers who have Pivoted everything they do, who knew that remote preschool was a thing until 2020?",11,,
80,0.97,722.154,724.223,Indeed it is.,11,,
81,0.97,724.223,744.677,"And so, are Seattle preschool program providers had to Pivot quickly and they worked that we worked with them over the summer to adjust our programming in contracting to best meet the needs of their communities, the children and families they serve.",11,,
82,0.97,744.677,754.053,Providers were able to choose the model that best fit their individual circumstances.,11,,
83,0.97,754.053,757.756,"Including staffing capacity, the size of their facilities and the needs of the community.",11,,
84,0.97,757.756,767.066,"And so, providers chose one of three of these models.",11,,
85,0.97,767.066,770.302,They either continue to deliver services 100% in person.,11,,
86,0.97,770.302,771.971,We do have some providers who do that.,11,,
87,0.97,771.971,778.01,We have providers who are doing 100% family directed or remote instruction.,11,,
88,0.97,778.01,782.481,"And then we have other providers who are doing a combination, sort of a hybrid model.",11,,
89,0.97,782.481,794.727,I want to just publicly acknowledge the flexibility and creativity and stick with it of our providers to Pivot the programming like this in the short turnaround.,11,,
90,0.97,794.727,800.599,It has been truly inspirational to see what they have been able to do for their families.,11,,
91,0.97,800.599,803.636,"Next slide, please.",11,,
92,0.97,803.636,812.711,"So in order to accommodate these changes, Deel made changes to the provider payment and family tuition models in response to these changes.",11,,
93,0.97,812.711,825.424,"And they affect both our expenses and revenue, which obviously ultimately impacts the bottom line for Spp.",11,,
94,0.97,825.424,834.533,"Firstly we reduced the slot payment for our providers that were offering 100% remote, reduced by 50%.",11,,
95,0.97,834.533,855.654,"Although the providers were not offering in person services, we know that staffing costs are still the same, teachers are working very hard to prepare and deliver meaningful instruction, they have to support families in more intense ways than ever, having to adapt to a whole new way of operating and of course they have facilities costs, etc.",11,,
96,0.97,855.654,858.357,We wanted to make sure we were keeping providers as whole as possible.,11,,
97,0.97,858.357,862.761,Recognizing they do have some reduce cost by only being 100% remote.,11,,
98,0.97,862.761,868.868,That was one of the decisions we made was to reduce the slot payment for 100% remote programs.,11,,
99,0.97,868.868,898.097,"Then we also fought on the family side, we gave consideration to the immense pressure families are facing right now in recognizing that when we talk about preschool, three and Four-Year-Olds we are also talking about Childcare and that many families now had to take on the responsibility of not only providing preschool instruction but also still perhaps looking for child care on the side.",11,,
100,0.97,898.097,908.908,"So, we made the change to have tuition waived completely for families who are getting 100% remote.",11,,
101,0.97,908.908,915.748,"If your child is not attending in person, and is doing it at home with adult support from home, then the tuition was waived.",11,,
102,0.97,915.748,926.325,"And for families that were in hybrid programs or in person programs, we decided to reduce the tuition by 50%.",11,,
103,0.97,926.325,931.63,"The thinking behind that was, and is going through significant challenges right now.",11,,
104,0.97,931.63,942.608,"And we wanted to get families, support families as much as possible recognizing that it's not going to be the same type of programming as we had been able to provide in previous years.",11,,
105,0.97,942.608,951.45,And also just to get families immediate relief and predict ability and what they were going to be spending their money on.,11,,
106,0.97,951.45,964.964,"So, those were the big changes, the changes we made we're here to talk about today.",11,,
107,0.97,964.964,969.835,"A couple things that didn't change, the fact that we did not change the slot payments for providers delivering 100% in person hybrid programming.",11,,
108,0.97,969.835,972.404,There receiving 100% of their original contract slot payment.,11,,
109,0.97,972.404,988.02,"We also did not actually change the requirements for tuition, so all families above 350% Federal poverty level according to the implementation evaluation plan or Legible for free tuition.",11,,
110,0.97,988.02,991.724,And that hasn't changed.,11,,
111,0.97,991.724,993.792,And that tuition calculated is still on a sliding scale.,11,,
112,0.97,993.792,994.626,Those have stayed consistent.,11,,
113,0.97,994.626,998.831,"Next slide, please.",11,,
114,0.97,998.831,1000.099,So this slide says a lot.,11,,
115,0.97,1000.099,1017.616,"I'm going to try to--there are two purposes, one is to give you an idea of the overall enrollment and the proportionality between the two types of programs we are offering.",11,,
116,0.97,1017.616,1022.02,And I also just want to highlight the group of families that are actually directly impacted by this policy tuition change.,11,,
117,0.97,1022.02,1045.744,"Just to give you a quick update on where we are in overall enrollment, you will see that our full capacity is about 80% enrollment this year which is actually not very different from other years, but, understandably lower because of Covid.",11,,
118,0.97,1045.744,1071.17,"About 80% of her children are identified as children coming from--you will see in terms of the capacity, they are roughly one third and one third and one third.",11,,
119,0.97,1071.17,1075.808,Our programs are pretty evenly distributed as our our seats.,11,,
120,0.97,1075.808,1080.879,We have been watching that carefully to make sure and see if there is Disproportionality and who is attending what type of program.,11,,
121,0.97,1080.879,1091.99,You will see the children are attending slightly higher 100% family directed versus in person.,11,,
122,0.97,1091.99,1100.599,Which is the same proportion as the overall seats available.,11,,
123,0.97,1100.599,1114.813,We have been looking at that closely and also doing--we conducted a survey with families to find out more about the experience of family directed and hybrid learning.,11,,
124,0.97,1114.813,1124.756,"And then, I'd like to focus your attention to the last column which is the families enrolled at 350% or above Federal poverty level.",11,,
125,0.97,1124.756,1132.197,These are actually the families to qualify for tuition and who are impacted by our change in tuition policy.,11,,
126,0.97,1132.197,1155.988,"So, as you can see, a total of 382 children are eligible and 25%, which is approximately 25% of the total, so of those, if you look at it, the ones that are in the top row, 160 kids family directed, those are the ones who got their tuition waived.",11,,
127,0.97,1155.988,1158.69,160 children.,11,,
128,0.97,1158.69,1160.125,They had tuition waived completely.,11,,
129,0.97,1160.125,1172.504,"The other two, hundred nine and 113 are the ones who had 50% of their tuition waived.",11,,
130,0.97,1172.504,1175.607,Now we can go to the next slide.,11,,
131,0.97,1175.607,1181.48,It shows you the budget impact.,11,,
132,0.97,1181.48,1197.496,This is really just the relevant Sliver of what are revenue expenses are in terms of the contracts and tuition.,11,,
133,0.97,1197.496,1201.733,This table shows the changes we made at the tuition and provider contracts mostly balance out.,11,,
134,0.97,1201.733,1207.639,"There's only about eight $95,000 projected gap between Úwhat we are expecting and what we are anticipating now.",11,,
135,0.97,1207.639,1212.11,"We were expecting Pre-Covid and what we are expecting now, even though those changes.",11,,
136,0.97,1212.11,1239.304,It just happened that the loss in tuition revenue and the decreased provider contracts pretty much evened out . and we still have $2.4 million in reserves in case the programming changes.,11,,
137,0.97,1242.24,1249.281,"The biggest provider who does remote instruction, if they decide to go back in person as there is talk right now in March, we would have enough money to increase the contracts again to 100%.",11,,
138,0.97,1249.281,1251.149,So we are in good shape for that.,11,,
139,0.97,1251.149,1256.188,That wraps up the changes in Spp policy.,11,,
140,0.97,1256.188,1261.259,I will pass it off to my colleague Dana.,11,,
141,0.97,1261.259,1275.273,"Thank you, and then for colleagues, what I was hoping to do is be able to go through the entire presentation just to make sure that Deel has ample time to get through it.",12,,
142,0.97,1275.273,1277.743,There's a lot of rich data in here.,12,,
143,0.97,1277.743,1285.884,"And then we will circle back and open it up to questions and comments about the entire presentation, once we are done.",12,,
144,0.97,1285.884,1287.586,Thank you for letting me interrupt.,12,,
145,0.97,1287.586,1292.791,Go ahead.,12,,
146,0.97,1292.791,1293.458,Thank you.,13,,
147,0.97,1293.458,1296.194,Good afternoon Council members and thanks for the opportunity to speak with you today.,13,,
148,0.97,1296.194,1321.019,"Before I dive in I just want to acknowledge that if you are familiar with the Seattle promise program and its recent growth, Council hasn't yet had a formal briefing on trends, I'm going to speak to some of the fall enrollment data which you may have heard about last week.",13,,
149,0.97,1321.019,1326.658,"This is a bit of a milestone in and of itself for us, as First- year students are the first Cohort of graduates coming from all SPs high schools.",13,,
150,0.97,1326.658,1329.194,In the first two expense all the fully skilled levy supports.,13,,
151,0.97,1329.194,1330.128,More on that.,13,,
152,0.97,1330.128,1342.741,But we are here seeking approval to and implement of the implementation plan that would allow current Seattle promise students to access the benefits of the program beyond the two year limit.,13,,
153,0.97,1342.741,1367.899,"Currently promise program supports which include tuition support, equity scholarships for living students, and the support of outreach and retention specialists through their college experience will only cover 90 attempted credits for two years of enrollment, whichever comes first.",13,,
154,0.97,1367.899,1373.905,So our colleagues at the colleges and those of us here at Deel are in strong support of offering students expanded flexibility in the impacts of the Covid-19.,13,,
155,0.97,1373.905,1386.785,Suspending the two year limit and allowing students to enroll part-time or different enrollment to a later date as a responsive action to take given the unusual circumstances the 20/20 has brought us.,13,,
156,0.97,1386.785,1394.126,"It's also consistent with the request we have received from students, families and our college partners themselves.",13,,
157,0.97,1394.126,1398.597,We hope you will come to the same conclusion and that this is the right thing to do for students this year.,13,,
158,0.97,1398.597,1401.433,"Next slide, thank you.",13,,
159,0.97,1401.433,1416.715,"Sharing with you here, a quick update on what's happening now, right now students are participating in an entirely virtual environment.",13,,
160,0.97,1416.715,1418.316,The summer bridge event was also conducted virtually.,13,,
161,0.97,1418.316,1422.154,That help to prepare students in September for the start of virtual classes at the end of September.,13,,
162,0.97,1422.154,1440.872,"The fall quarter began, the Seattle promise program opened its largest Cohort of scholars today, 846 enrolled this fall which is really exciting given the circumstances and speaks to the tremendous adaptability and resilience of the students and many staff members who continue to support them through this.",13,,
163,0.97,1440.872,1456.254,"You may have heard in the news and multiple outlets over the last month or so, there has been a drop experienced by a lot of community colleges and other four year institution enrollments across the country as a result of the pandemic.",13,,
164,0.97,1456.254,1459.858,So it's really exciting to be able to say we actually had growth.,13,,
165,0.97,1459.858,1469.267,Next slide.,13,,
166,0.97,1469.267,1472.604,Here you see a little more specific of a breakdown of fall enrollment.,13,,
167,0.97,1472.604,1478.81,"Including full-time and Part- time enrollment, as well as the request to defer by class.",13,,
168,0.97,1478.81,1491.189,In fall of 2020 Seattle colleges have enrolled 699 First-Year students and 147 Second-Tier students.,13,,
169,0.97,1491.189,1501.333,So far total we have 18 request to defer enrollment as a result of the pandemic.,13,,
170,0.97,1501.333,1509.307,"Next slide, please.",13,,
171,0.97,1509.307,1518.884,"So the legislation under consideration would suspend the two year limit on enrollment for current promise scholar as I shared, and allow them to fully benefit from deferred enrollment as a result of Covid.",13,,
172,0.97,1518.884,1529.828,"Under normal circumstances the implementation plan restricts promise students supports 290 attempted credits or two years, whichever comes first.",13,,
173,0.97,1529.828,1544.042,"In mid-September the colleges reported to Deel and we were hearing from students and families as well that they were seeing a lot of, a large increase in the number of students requesting to defer or enroll part-time.",13,,
174,0.97,1544.042,1556.922,"And consideration of this type of request to go part-time and not be full-time, which is part of the promise program, is permitted as it now stands for extenuating circumstances.",13,,
175,0.97,1556.922,1560.859,But this fall presented a significantly higher volume.,13,,
176,0.97,1560.859,1564.296,And what isn't part of the provision now is the two year limit.,13,,
177,0.97,1564.296,1583.014,"By allowing students in the first and second year this year to extend beyond that, we are making sure that those critical Seattle promise supports that are helping them complete their degree or certificate are still in place all the way through their program.",13,,
178,0.97,1583.014,1596.628,So this change not only helps the colleges accommodate the higher than normal number of exceptional requests but also extends the duration of the promise support for students.,13,,
179,0.97,1596.628,1600.899,"As we saw previously, currently there are about 217 students who would benefit directly from this policy change.",13,,
180,0.97,1600.899,1608.206,What is unchanged is the eligibility requirements for the program.,13,,
181,0.97,1608.206,1609.441,Meeting milestones along the way.,13,,
182,0.97,1609.441,1616.548,"They have been adapted so it would match whether or not they are part-time or deferred, but they would still need to meet the milestones.",13,,
183,0.97,1616.548,1622.821,The maximum credits attempted remains the same.,13,,
184,0.97,1622.821,1628.727,As does the need to stay in good academic standing which is the satisfactory academic progress.,13,,
185,0.97,1628.727,1634.432,"Next slide, please.",13,,
186,0.97,1634.432,1639.671,The estimates I am sharing here are based on the best available data we have to date.,13,,
187,0.97,1639.671,1650.448,I want to acknowledge that we expect some variability because financial aid information is fluid and will flex Porter by quarter depending on the students participating.,13,,
188,0.97,1650.448,1661.126,"For now, extra tuition costs for part-time students is roughly $300 per quarter beyond the two-year promise experience.",13,,
189,0.97,1661.126,1678.476,"So to extend the promise for one additional quarter, which is what you see in the middle column, we estimate that to come at a cost of $6300 and to extend for a full year or three quarters we estimate a cost of $18,800.",13,,
190,0.97,1678.476,1711.81,"For students with a demonstrated financial need, equity scholarships, provide additional financial support, so they can pay for things like food and transportation and housing, whatever they need to help them pursue their education, based on the number of part-time students currently receiving this benefit, we estimate a cost of $49,000 for one quarter extension, $147,000 for a Three-Quarter one year extension.",13,,
191,0.97,1711.81,1721.953,"And then, finally, retention specialists, they may be needed to support the additional caseload.",13,,
192,0.97,1721.953,1730.929,"As students enroll part-time or defer to the following quarter, it might shift our numbers a little bit and we want to be responsive and make sure we are still providing the necessary supports for students.",13,,
193,0.97,1730.929,1744.943,"If that requires additional staff for one quarter, the cost reflected there, and then the Three-Quarter column represents the need for two retention specialists.",13,,
194,0.97,1744.943,1749.981,This is really accounting for unknowns around deferred students.,13,,
195,0.97,1749.981,1758.556,And if more students will request part-time beyond just this first full quarter.,13,,
196,0.97,1758.556,1764.662,"Next slide, please.",13,,
197,0.97,1764.662,1765.663,"Thank you, Dana.",14,,
198,0.97,1765.663,1770.502,So this is actually in conclusion for our presentation.,14,,
199,0.97,1770.502,1776.407,I wanted to share with you some forthcoming Council engagements in 2021.,14,,
200,0.97,1776.407,1791.589,"We do plan on coming back for our 2019 excuse me, 2019/2020 annual report, we will come back and share about infant and child care studies have been conducted.",14,,
201,0.97,1791.589,1799.964,We have presentation Rsji change team and as needed we will come back for Fepp amendments.,14,,
202,0.97,1799.964,1806.237,This concludes our presentation for today.,14,,
203,0.97,1806.237,1809.44,"Thank you, director Dwane Chappelle for that.",15,,
204,0.97,1809.44,1825.123,"Colleagues, I want to go ahead and open it up for questions or comments on the proposed flexibility legislation as described by staff from Deel.",15,,
205,0.97,1825.123,1830.762,Any questions or comments?,15,,
206,0.97,1830.762,1834.432,"Yes, Madam President.",16,,
207,0.97,1834.432,1836.734,Go ahead.,17,,
208,0.97,1836.734,1838.336,I was having technical issues.,18,,
209,0.97,1838.336,1845.043,"I didn't see that I couldn't see your Video, so I'm sorry if I missed you.",19,,
210,0.97,1845.043,1846.044,Go ahead.,19,,
211,0.97,1846.044,1847.478,No problem.,20,,
212,0.97,1847.478,1857.855,Thank you very much.,20,,
213,0.97,1858.122,1862.093,"Thank you Madam chair and thank you everybody from the Deel team, it's really good to see all of you.",20,,
214,0.97,1862.093,1877.442,"I did want to just raise something I know you're well aware of, but as we think about ways we can support folks who need Childcare and assistance for families or teachers, Kiddos, we know your work has been essential in helping to provide much-needed support during this Covid crisis.",20,,
215,0.97,1877.442,1890.288,"And appreciate we are talking about the need for flexibility is clear, we also want to make sure we are doing everything we can to help keep Childcare providers open.",20,,
216,0.97,1890.288,1902.734,"Air Childcare provider had a scare last week, and I know it was really a hardship for all of the families who were working from home, but was more of a hardship for the workers and the organization itself.",20,,
217,0.97,1902.734,1920.952,"I am looking forward to hearing more about what we can do regarding the long wait list Pre-Covid, resulting in Disproportional hardship for women, people of color, families continue to worry about new closures and how it will result in even greater disparities.",20,,
218,0.97,1920.952,1946.411,"I know Deel, especially with director Dwane Chappelle in your leadership, these are concerns you have raised today and in the past, I want to lift up the important work and the lens you apply to this to make sure we are looking at those racial equity issues and how it affects our lowest wage workers and small businesses including Childcare providers.",20,,
219,0.97,1946.411,1949.847,I look forward to the continued partnership with you.,20,,
220,0.97,1949.847,1963.261,"If there's anything else you want to highlight in the public forum about the ways in which your greater flexibility to help our Childcare providers stay open, I know that information has been well received and appreciated.",20,,
221,0.97,1963.261,1965.663,I just want to Cue that up for you.,20,,
222,0.97,1965.663,1967.565,Thank you for your support.,21,,
223,0.97,1967.565,1968.166,We appreciate everything.,21,,
224,0.97,1968.166,1974.872,You want to share or uplift anything before we close out?,21,,
225,0.97,1974.872,1976.674,You have to take yourself off of mute.,21,,
226,0.97,1976.674,1979.777,I've been doing this for nine months and I still make this mistake.,22,,
227,0.97,1979.777,1990.154,I think I know Dwane Chappelle shared with you our recent Co- pay release that we did for our families.,22,,
228,0.97,1990.154,1994.592,Waving Co-Pay for November and December as immediate relief for families.,22,,
229,0.97,1994.592,2002.5,We continue to work with our providers to support both them and families.,22,,
230,0.97,2002.5,2008.606,It's a constant balancing act.,22,,
231,0.97,2008.606,2016.514,I look forward to sharing with you a lot of our recommendations that will come forth in the new year.,22,,
232,0.97,2016.514,2022.22,Thank you very much.,23,,
233,0.97,2022.22,2056.687,"I would say on that point, part of what we did to the last budget process, not this one but 2019, is advance a set of statements of legislative intent and actual budget actions to provide deal with additional resources in order to work with consultants and other folks around identifying solutions, Holistic system solutions to some of the issues you are just highlighting Councilmember Mosqueda.",24,,
234,0.97,2056.687,2061.592,I understand that work is on track to be completed.,24,,
235,0.97,2061.592,2065.863,And then send over to the city council this month.,24,,
236,0.97,2065.863,2070.968,I am hoping that is still going to be the case.,24,,
237,0.97,2070.968,2074.772,Looking forward to some of the work product we have done there.,24,,
238,0.97,2074.772,2087.185,"It's going to be a big part of the community's work in the first quarter of next year, digging into some recommendations and analysis, there is going to continue to be a need.",24,,
239,0.97,2087.185,2090.688,There was a need before Covid and it continues to be a need now.,24,,
240,0.97,2090.688,2112.343,"And I think Deel is to be commended for all the good work they have been doing and hard work you have been doing to partner with our service provider, Childcare provider network including SPs to try to mitigate the impacts of closures during this period of Covid.",24,,
241,0.97,2112.343,2114.212,We really appreciate that work.,24,,
242,0.97,2114.212,2119.517,"Any other comments or questions, Councilmember Strauss?",24,,
243,0.97,2119.517,2120.318,Thank you.,25,,
244,0.97,2120.318,2129.694,"And thank you, this is been a very helpful presentation.",25,,
245,0.97,2129.694,2142.84,I first got to work on the 13th and 14th year college program in 2015 and I was staff for the Senator in working in partnership with now you a present of dipole.,25,,
246,0.97,2142.84,2147.945,I have been long excited for this court to come through.,25,,
247,0.97,2147.945,2166.797,"I want to call out and appreciate your focus on flexibility, especially around deferment, being able to plan for deferment and what may come in a year or two, to still be able to provide this promise to students that might not be going to school right now.",25,,
248,0.97,2166.797,2174.172,I want to overall thank you and focus on the flexibility and thank you for focusing in on the deferment aspect.,25,,
249,0.97,2174.172,2174.906,"Thank you, all.",25,,
250,0.97,2174.906,2179.31,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",26,,
251,0.97,2179.31,2180.011,"Any other comments, colleagues?",26,,
252,0.97,2180.011,2180.811,"Yes, Madam chair.",27,,
253,0.97,2180.811,2184.482,Please Councilmember Juarez.,28,,
254,0.97,2184.482,2185.082,Thank you.,29,,
255,0.97,2185.082,2186.918,"It is so good to see you, Monica.",29,,
256,0.97,2186.918,2191.589,"Anyway, just quickly, thank you so much for this work.",29,,
257,0.97,2191.589,2197.695,As you know some of us were around when we were unveiling the promise program in Ingram.,29,,
258,0.97,2197.695,2203.0,In our work with Nathan Hale.,29,,
259,0.97,2203.0,2207.605,This continues to be a very popular program.,29,,
260,0.97,2207.605,2212.109,"It gets talked about, when I talked to two principals at a high schools.",29,,
261,0.97,2212.109,2224.755,"The work we are doing and under the leadership of President Gonzalez for the deal, the idea of having this flexibility legislation speaks to us trying to stand top of everything in the midst of this pandemic fueled recession.",29,,
262,0.97,2224.755,2226.324,And everything else that has come with it.,29,,
263,0.97,2226.324,2227.825,Thank you for your leadership Council President.,29,,
264,0.97,2227.825,2234.832,And thank you to Dwane Chappelle as always for bringing it.,29,,
265,0.97,2234.832,2236.467,"Again, it's really good to see Monica.",29,,
266,0.97,2236.467,2237.435,Thank you.,29,,
267,0.97,2237.435,2241.739,Councilmember Juarez.,30,,
268,0.97,2241.739,2259.457,So one of the things we didn't have an opportunity to dig into that I do think is worth lifting up is the enrollment demographics that we are seeing as it relates to the Seattle promise program.,31,,
269,0.97,2259.457,2288.085,"This is a new program for the city of Seattle, administered by Deel . and when we first supported it we wanted to make sure there was a huge attention and focus on Rsji to make sure that there wasn't any unintended consequences or disproportionate impacts to students of color who might otherwise be Accessing what was formally known as the 13th year program.",31,,
270,0.97,2288.085,2299.83,And so I am really pleased to see some of the numbers in terms of race and Ethnicity coming out about who is currently enrolled in terms of the Cohort of 2020.,31,,
271,0.97,2299.83,2336.634,"We didn't see [Indiscernible] enrollment numbers in this presentation but we do have Disaggregated numbers with regard to a different demographic, race and Ethnicity, on that--and I think director Dwane Chappelle, if I can ask you and your staff to share that memo with the whole Committee, I think that would be really helpful to make sure that everyone has the Disaggregated numbers.",31,,
272,0.97,2336.634,2341.138,One of the things I will say is that the numbers related to the Asian category or demographic are still not desegregated.,31,,
273,0.97,2341.138,2353.05,They are altogether in one lump and I don't know if we have the opportunity to do cross tabs to further segregate the category of Asian students who are part of the Cohort.,31,,
274,0.97,2353.05,2356.954,If there is I would ask for that modification to be made.,31,,
275,0.97,2356.954,2380.478,"If there isn't, I think we need a conversation about the city's commitment to desegregate numbers within the API category so we get a better indicator of who is Accessing the program and who is not within the 2020 promise Cohort and beyond.",31,,
276,0.97,2380.478,2391.489,"I look forward to that memo, colleagues, in terms of further desegregation of the numbers in terms of who is Accessing the program, is really great.",31,,
277,0.97,2391.489,2395.126,I am really excited to continue to see how that expands.,31,,
278,0.97,2395.126,2404.068,I will also say I'm really pleased we are moving in a direction in this legislation to allow for part-time attendance.,31,,
279,0.97,2404.068,2418.048,"That was something I really wanted to see occur in the original proposal, but we decided to take a slow and steady approach instead.",31,,
280,0.97,2418.048,2422.753,This legislation allows for us to be a little more intentional for students to participate.,31,,
281,0.97,2422.753,2436.767,"And again, the numbers of those who are interested in enrolling and participating indicate there is a significant number of folks who are interested in the part-time option and who are still academically succeeding in performing.",31,,
282,0.97,2436.767,2453.384,And so I think that is going to be an important data piece for us to collect to see if we can continue to support those students who have academic interests and ambitions but who only have the capacity to do part-time for other reasons in their life.,31,,
283,0.97,2453.384,2461.959,I just wanted to lift up those things as it relates to Seattle promise and appreciate Councilmember Mosqueda highlighting the issues around early learning in particular.,31,,
284,0.97,2461.959,2466.797,Lots of work to be done there.,31,,
285,0.97,2466.797,2485.716,"And, looking forward to having you all back in Committee next week to talk about, not next week, next year, to go through the list of all of the other things that I know we have for briefing and discussion on the Fepp levy.",31,,
286,0.97,2485.716,2491.989,"Let's go ahead, if there is no other questions or issues, Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",31,,
287,0.97,2491.989,2496.494,You so much.,32,,
288,0.97,2496.494,2511.509,"Taking a deeper dive into the desegregation issue you flagged, one of the things I am hearing from other departments and I want to see if this is true in Deel, are we Disaggregating how many Latino community family members we are serving?",32,,
289,0.97,2511.509,2526.523,Because I had heard that trying to get information about Latino community services across various city departments has been challenging some of our community partners.,32,,
290,0.97,2526.523,2530.027,I wanted to use this as an opportunity if see if that is true as well.,32,,
291,0.97,2530.027,2536.667,Let me follow up with my data team to see.,33,,
292,0.97,2536.667,2540.337,When we follow-up with you I will be able to answer that question specifically for you.,33,,
293,0.97,2540.337,2544.141,"Dana, I am looking at you specifically, and let you know that right now.",33,,
294,0.97,2544.141,2556.687,"Maybe this goes both to your question, Councilmember Mosqueda and also the question about the Asian desegregation.",34,,
295,0.97,2556.687,2563.093,It is something we have been pursuing with our partners.,34,,
296,0.97,2563.093,2567.565,We do have to do that in concert with them in terms of how the data gets collected in the first place.,34,,
297,0.97,2567.565,2579.043,"The conversation started with them that we can continue to pursue, at the moment we don't have it we hope in our future work with them we start to put in place systems that allow us to collect that and ensure that information.",34,,
298,0.97,2579.043,2593.59,"Currently we do capture, if people identify as Hispanic or Latino, that data is captured.",35,,
299,0.97,2593.59,2601.699,What is not captured is any sort of sub Categorization or sub demographics in the Hispanic/Latino category.,35,,
300,0.97,2601.699,2613.243,"Similar for Asian populations, it just says Asian as a broad category but doesn't further identify Korean, Chinese, Filipino, etc.",35,,
301,0.97,2613.243,2631.962,"And so I think, there is interest, if there is ongoing interest in further refining the data, then there is an opportunity to do that work in partnership with Deel.",35,,
302,0.97,2631.962,2640.404,"Of course as Dana mentioned, our data is only as good as that of which are partners are actively and Proactively collecting.",35,,
303,0.97,2640.404,2643.374,And of course we also have categories of Multiracial and other race.,35,,
304,0.97,2643.374,2645.342,And missing or not reported information.,35,,
305,0.97,2645.342,2683.18,"So there is--the information is as accurate as it can be on the reality that we are relying on people to Self-Report . I think it would be helpful if Deel shared this memo with Council members and if there is ongoing concerns about how we are capturing the data, there is an opportunity I think to engage the Department on ideas on how to refine the process.",35,,
306,0.97,2683.18,2686.383,"Okay, it looks like we have concluded our conversation on this bill.",35,,
307,0.97,2686.383,2690.487,I do want to call this bill up for a vote.,35,,
308,0.97,2690.487,2700.998,I think Deel is looking for us to hopefully address this bill today.,35,,
309,0.97,2700.998,2712.209,So that they have some certainty in moving forward operationally on the flexibility they are requesting and the Fepp levy investment.,35,,
310,0.97,2712.209,2713.877,I'm going to call this for a vote.,35,,
311,0.97,2713.877,2716.113,I move the committee recommend passage of Council bill 119967.,35,,

316,0.97,2730.661,2734.131,Hearing none will the clerk Lee's call role of the committee's recommendation that the bill passed?,37,,
317,0.97,2734.131,2735.332,Councilmember Juarez.,38,,

324,0.97,2744.274,2744.742,Yes.,43,,
325,0.97,2744.742,2748.946,Four in favor an Unopposed.,43,,
326,0.97,2748.946,2751.815,Motion carries and the committee will recommend to full council that the bill pass.,43,,
327,0.97,2751.815,2758.455,We will consider this at our December 14 city council meeting at 2:00 or thereabouts.,43,,
328,0.97,2758.455,2772.102,"Thank you to all of the leaders within Deel, we really appreciate your time and attention to this and your hard work on behalf of Seattle's families.",43,,
329,0.97,2772.102,2773.504,"Thanks, Dana.",44,,
330,0.97,2773.504,2776.373,"Thank you, guys.",45,,
331,0.97,2776.373,2777.775,See you later.,46,,
332,0.97,2777.775,2779.977,Goodbye.,47,,
333,0.97,2779.977,2790.187,Audios.,48,,
334,0.97,2791.889,2793.891,How many different ways can we say goodbye?,49,,
335,0.97,2793.891,2797.294,We are going to move into item 2. we only have two items on today's agenda.,50,,
336,0.97,2797.294,2799.53,Hopefully we will move quickly to the second item as well.,50,,
337,0.97,2799.53,2801.999,Will the clerk please read item number two into the record?,50,,
338,0.97,2801.999,2818.215,"Agenda item number two, 119968, an ordinance relating to lobbying regulations; expanding lobbying regulations to cover grassroots lobbying campaigns; correcting Typographical errors, correcting section references, clarifying regulations, and making minor amendments; and amending chapter 2.06 of the Seattle municipal code.",51,,
339,0.97,2818.215,2820.651,"For a briefing, discussion and possible vote.",51,,
340,0.97,2820.651,2822.319,Thank you.,52,,
341,0.97,2822.319,2837.534,"All right, so we have some guests in our virtual meeting today, we have Wayne Barnett was the director of the Seattle ethics and elections Commission.",52,,
342,0.97,2837.534,2840.237,And Nicholas Brown who is the chair of the Seattle ethics and elections Commission.,52,,
343,0.97,2840.237,2852.349,And we have counseled central staff who prepared a very thorough and high quality brief for Council members to get up to speed on this proposed legislation.,52,,
344,0.97,2852.349,2877.674,I'm going to go ahead and handed over to Lish who is going to walk us through his memo and make himself available for any questions and then we will hear from director Barnett and chair Brown on the proposed recommendations from the Seattle ethics and elections Commission in this bill.,52,,
345,0.97,2877.674,2880.177,Take it away.,53,,
346,0.97,2880.177,2882.813,This is ethics regulations 2008.,54,,
347,0.97,2882.813,2927.524,"They are focused on members of the public to influence city legislation, currently they require that lobbyists who perform direct lobbying, which means talking to elected officials and members of the staff or legislative Department in an attempt to legislate, or change or influence legislation need to register with the ethics and elections Commission and they need to then submit quarterly reports as do any people who are hiring them to perform those lobbying activities.",54,,
348,0.97,2927.524,2935.432,The proposed legislation is the first major update to those regulations since they were adopted in 2008.,54,,
349,0.97,2935.432,2942.773,They incorporate a concept called grassroots lobbying which has been in state law since 1973.,54,,
350,0.97,2942.773,2961.258,"They require that lobbying of Department directors and those directors, direct reports, be included in lobbying reports and qualify as lobbying activity.",54,,
351,0.97,2961.258,2987.818,"And they require that if a lobbyist works on a political campaign for a city elected office, they disclose that activity and the In-Kind or paid work as part of their lobbying reporting.",54,,
352,0.97,2987.818,3013.143,"To dive down a little deeper into the definition of grassroots lobbying, it is an effort by members of the public to influence legislation, not by directly talking to elected officials, but instead by encouraging members of the public to lobby their elected officials.",54,,
353,0.97,3013.143,3032.863,The definition of grassroots lobbying sponsor includes groups that spend at least $750 in a month to carry out a campaign or $1500 in a three-month period.,54,,
354,0.97,3032.863,3043.874,"And, with that, I think I will handed over to the executive director, unless Council members have questions.",54,,
355,0.97,3043.874,3053.25,"Council members, any questions for Lish before we hear from director Barnett?",55,,
356,0.97,3053.25,3056.686,I am not seeing any hands being raised.,55,,
357,0.97,3056.686,3062.793,Let's go ahead and hear from are guessed from the Seattle elections Commission.,55,,
358,0.97,3062.793,3082.679,"At this point I'd love to turn over to the chair, Nicholas Brown, I should point out Nick is finishing his one and only term as chair of the ethics Commission, he is rotating at the end of this month.",56,,
359,0.97,3082.679,3086.249,He is been a wonderful chair and we want to recognize his service to the people of Seattle.,56,,
360,0.97,3086.249,3088.385,This is likely to be his last official action as chair.,56,,
361,0.97,3088.385,3090.387,I'm going to let him say some words first.,56,,
362,0.97,3090.387,3095.492,Thank you Wayne and Councilmember President Gonzalez.,57,,
363,0.97,3095.492,3104.768,"It's going to be back before the Council again, I think the last time I was President before you was when I was being appointed.",57,,
364,0.97,3104.768,3108.105,"This is a nice circular and to my term on the Commission, it's a pleasure to serve.",57,,
365,0.97,3108.105,3119.449,"I want to provide high-level context for how this came to the Commission's consideration, I think Lish Whitson provided a nice overview.",57,,
366,0.97,3119.449,3159.256,"The legislation around changing the Seattle ethics code first arose back in 2017 but was brought to the Commission's attention in early 2019, originally what the Commission first started reviewing and considering changes to were the lobbying provisions around people who wear two hats and work on legal campaigns and try to bring additional transparency and awareness to the public of those rules.",57,,
367,0.97,3159.256,3188.718,"We initially considered testimony changes regarding that issue and then as we started to dive down deeper, into the code, which was as pointed out had not been amended since adopted in 2008, we started to try to find ways to bring the city ethics code more in alignment with the state ex six ethics law, so we imported almost word for word the provisions better known as grassroots lobbying and recommended those be put into the Seattle code as well.",57,,
368,0.97,3188.718,3190.787,"You know, this for many years has not been regulated.",57,,
369,0.97,3190.787,3209.039,"There are number of ways that large amounts of money gets spent to lobby to influence legislation, not just directly to elected officials, but to the public, to have the public lobby elected officials.",57,,
370,0.97,3209.039,3218.815,As we consider this bill over the last couple of years we thought it was a good opportunity to bring alignment to the state law and also more transparency awareness of how the legislation was made.,57,,
371,0.97,3218.815,3222.018,So those were made into the Council bill before you.,57,,
372,0.97,3222.018,3224.921,I will turn it back to you if you have any direct questions.,57,,
373,0.97,3224.921,3241.938,"I would just add one other facet of the review to the chair Synopsis, we also look at our peer cities from around the country to make sure the lobbying line 2019 was as good as Eric compatriot cities around the country.",58,,
374,0.97,3241.938,3253.149,I think that was largely behind the move to regulate lobbying executive branch officials as well.,58,,
375,0.97,3253.149,3265.762,"I think that is something we learned from a review of San Francisco and Los Angeles and New York and other cities, as you all know, legislation largely begins at the Department level.",58,,
376,0.97,3265.762,3273.937,We want to make sure that that was captured as well as lobbying of the council as well as the executive.,58,,
377,0.97,3273.937,3283.98,"Like I said, I think the most important thing to underscore here is timing of this is very interesting.",58,,
378,0.97,3283.98,3298.995,"Did send this over, I think it was approved by the Commission last December, we waited until the Council had organized itself for 2020, Council President Gonzalez was nominated to lead the Council to send it over.",58,,
379,0.97,3298.995,3307.737,"So it came over in January and with the pandemic, strangely enough, here we are in December 2020 where it's getting it's hearing.",58,,
380,0.97,3307.737,3309.539,I just want to underscore that.,58,,
381,0.97,3309.673,3321.217,"The small other point I would add onto that is looking at our peer cities, there obviously a wide variety of approaches adopted across the country around changing ethics code.",59,,
382,0.97,3321.217,3329.826,Many cities outright prohibit Orban the types of things that are contemplated in this legislation.,59,,
383,0.97,3329.826,3348.178,"Rather than prohibit lobbyists from serving the rules, we decided the best was to bring more transparency to the issues rather than prohibit the type of work . But there are different approaches that other cities have taken.",59,,
384,0.97,3348.178,3351.981,But we decided prohibition was a step two far for a recommendation.,59,,
385,0.97,3351.981,3365.862,That just gets the code into alignment of the original intent of the 2008 legislation to promote full disclosure and protect the integrity of our legislative process.,59,,
386,0.97,3365.862,3368.098,That was the guiding principle of the work we did.,59,,
387,0.97,3368.098,3395.492,"Really helpful context for conversations today, so I do want to open it up for any questions or comments . again, colleagues, it's my hope that we can vote on this legislation today . I think the legislation is pretty straightforward.",60,,
388,0.97,3395.492,3405.034,And I do want to apologize for the long delay in getting this bill heard.,60,,
389,0.97,3405.034,3428.625,"I know the Commission has had a Long-Standing interest in addressing some of these lobbying issues, and, but for my maternity leave and of course part of 2020 then followed by the pandemic immediately thereafter, we would have addressed this in probably the first quarter of 2020.",60,,
390,0.97,3428.625,3430.226,"Be that as it may, here we are.",60,,
391,0.97,3430.226,3460.957,"Have an opportunity to consider this legislation and as chair Brown mentioned, we have an opportunity to align ourselves with better practices and standards as it relates to lobbying requirements in our code, both in terms of other sister cities but also in terms of what the regulatory framework is at the state level.",60,,
392,0.97,3460.957,3466.663,We appreciate the opportunity for us to have this conversation here and consider these recommendations.,60,,
393,0.97,3466.663,3473.77,Any comments or questions?,61,,
394,0.97,3473.77,3474.37,Councilmember Juarez.,61,,
395,0.97,3474.37,3483.913,"Just quickly, I was looking at the fiscal note, summary fiscal NOTE and I wanted to ask a question, I don't know if that goes to the--to Mr.",62,,
396,0.97,3483.913,3491.588,"Brown or to Lish or our other friend, I already forgot his name.",62,,
397,0.97,3491.588,3491.821,Wayne.,62,,
398,0.97,3491.821,3509.305,"And again, about the budget piece, you talking about it, does this mean we are looking at third-quarter supplemental requests? you have a strategic advisor to investigate or provide sufficient staff.",62,,
399,0.97,3509.305,3512.342,So we need fully loaded cost for these positions?,62,,
400,0.97,3512.342,3516.012,Currently don't have the staff to implement this?,62,,
401,0.97,3516.012,3518.248,"No no, we do not.",63,,
402,0.97,3518.248,3541.371,"As you know elections in the last 10 years have grown far more competitive and far more Contestant and previously the strategic advisor who was mainly in charge of our election code compliance was able to do both at and lobbyist compliance, but in 2021 that is just not feasible.",63,,
403,0.97,3541.371,3543.773,That is an excellent question.,64,,
404,0.97,3543.773,3554.384,I guess when we normally pass the legislation we try to be equitable and also allocate commensurate resources to the agencies.,64,,
405,0.97,3554.384,3561.557,"A lot of these regulations, as we all know, are as good as the enforcement arm is.",64,,
406,0.97,3561.557,3574.604,So I do feel a responsibility for the city Council to address the resource issues that are a reality for the Seattle elections Commission.,64,,
407,0.97,3574.604,3586.115,"The now have the voucher program, they have the lobbying regulations, and a whole host of other things to come along with some transparency.",64,,
408,0.97,3586.115,3620.75,"There's also the campaign act portion of the legislation we passed in January and also pass, so I think there is an important conversation that needs to be had either in the fourth quarter supplemental or in the first quarter of 2021, to advance what I think is a modest budget request for another strategic advisor for the Seattle ethics and elections Commission to come up with the regulatory work they are charged with performing.",64,,
409,0.97,3620.75,3664.694,"Madam chair, I bring that up just as a side NOTE because with the social media piece and the AG suing Facebook and everybody posting a political ads and trying to enforce that piece, you are not going to be able to do it with just just one, and I would support you and that, in light of all the other, everything that has gone on in the last six months, in light of that and the challenging of that and how you're going to enforce social media platforms for violating and posting political ads and how you're going to enforce that when you are just looking at what the AG had filed against is it Facebook and Twitter?",65,,
410,0.97,3664.694,3669.032,"You're going to need that are going to have to ramp up there, Wayne.",65,,
411,0.97,3669.032,3672.402,I will support you in that.,65,,
412,0.97,3672.402,3673.67,I know the chair is listing.,65,,
413,0.97,3673.67,3675.204,Or maybe she is not.,65,,
414,0.97,3675.204,3700.43,"I do want to sort of, in full transparency to the public and in fairness to the Seattle ethics and elections Commission, I do recognize that there are additional resources needed and we are resource thin at the city given the Covid related economic crisis we are currently experiencing.",66,,
415,0.97,3700.43,3703.199,I think this is a high priority for the integrity of our elections.,66,,
416,0.97,3703.199,3708.204,And for the integrity of our legislative processes.,66,,
417,0.97,3708.204,3714.444,I think it is a nominal amount of money relative to the whole budget.,66,,
418,0.97,3714.444,3716.512,And if we should be making efforts to privatize this.,66,,
419,0.97,3716.512,3733.763,Either chair Brown have lobbied or asked me to make these requests make they have pointed out they don't have the resources but they have not lobbied me or asked me to champion those additional resources.,66,,
420,0.97,3733.763,3741.437,But I do want to say I think it's important for us to do that either in fourth-quarter or the first quarter of 2021.,66,,
421,0.97,3741.437,3746.943,Lish got in there.,67,,
422,0.97,3746.943,3748.344,"Thank you, Lish.",68,,
423,0.97,3748.344,3752.448,"Good job, Lish.",69,,
424,0.97,3752.448,3753.249,Any other comments?,70,,
425,0.97,3753.249,3755.084,Ac Councilmember Strauss and then and 14.,70,,
426,0.97,3755.084,3765.595,"Quickly had the opportunity to spend time with Lish to review the memo, I want to let chair Brown and Mr. Barnett know this is good Governance legislation.",71,,
427,0.97,3765.595,3767.396,Very straightforward.,71,,
428,0.97,3767.396,3782.278,We are looking forward to supporting it and supporting the chair and budget chairs and Councilmember Juarez support.,71,,
429,0.97,3782.278,3783.78,I haven't heard from the budget chair.,71,,
430,0.97,3783.78,3792.688,I would support moving resources to help you enforce and promote the programs within the Seattle elections and ethics Commission.,71,,
431,0.97,3792.688,3794.891,Thank you all so much for this great Governance legislation.,71,,
432,0.97,3794.891,3797.727,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,72,,
433,0.97,3797.727,3798.528,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",72,,
434,0.97,3798.528,3801.998,Thank you very much.,73,,
435,0.97,3801.998,3806.903,"Hello, Wayne, good to see you again.",73,,
436,0.97,3806.903,3813.209,"Sorry for the Back-And-Forth, I appreciate all the work you're doing especially recognizing you that national attention on you.",73,,
437,0.97,3813.209,3831.127,"Again, I want to lift up the awesome work you and your entire team have done to really lead the way with democracy vouchers, but also how and ethics and elections office can function and have a meaningful impact.",73,,
438,0.97,3831.127,3833.129,"I want to say hello, good to see you again.",73,,
439,0.97,3833.129,3837.833,I appreciate the work your office has done and I'm going to ask a few questions and I apologize if he's been answered.,73,,
440,0.97,3837.833,3838.768,I have a high-level summary.,73,,
441,0.97,3838.768,3844.44,"The definition of lobbying, it seems a little confusing to me.",73,,
442,0.97,3844.44,3856.786,"Can you tell me what the differences between ""officers or employees legislative Department or working in the Mayor's office"" what is the purpose of the working and modifier?",73,,
443,0.97,3856.786,3866.762,,74,,
444,0.97,3866.762,3872.268,There is a little bit of sound in the background.,75,,
445,0.97,3872.268,3876.372,I'm sorry.,76,,
446,0.97,3876.372,3879.375,There we go.,77,,
447,0.97,3879.375,3880.009,Go ahead.,77,,
448,0.97,3880.009,3893.823,"I believe the purpose of that was because the Mayor's office, there is some people who interpret the Mayor's office to include the office of civil rights and into governmental relations and other offices.",78,,
449,0.97,3893.823,3906.602,I think the working in the Mayor's office was really intended to make clear that the legislation was intended to reach those people who were on the seventh floor of city hall.,78,,
450,0.97,3906.602,3909.505,That was the purpose for that modifier in relation to the Mayor's office.,78,,
451,0.97,3909.505,3911.707,"All right, that's helpful.",79,,
452,0.97,3911.707,3912.141,To questions.,79,,
453,0.97,3912.141,3936.332,"The second one is, in the summary fiscal NOTE it says the addition of grassroots lobbying registration requirements will also increase the risk that ad hoc groups of people and organizations may inadvertently run afoul to lobbying regulations and get compliance--penalties for noncompliance.",79,,
454,0.97,3936.332,3942.338,Can you tell us more about who these organizations and people are the will now be included and what education and outreach support are we including for the organizations?,79,,
455,0.97,3942.338,3950.646,This gets at some of the questions I was thinking about regarding the state involved in this process we can see how it can be applied.,79,,
456,0.97,3950.646,3956.385,I believe that fiscal NOTE was written in light of 2020 and what's happened in 2020.,80,,
457,0.97,3956.385,3961.657,"I think one of the things our office is known for is, we are not a got you office.",80,,
458,0.97,3961.657,3969.799,"We are not out there trying to penalize people, we are not looking to impose penalties.",80,,
459,0.97,3969.799,3983.179,We are looking to make sure the public gets the information that the law entitles them to and we always thought the best way to do that is by educating and holding hands of people who are subject to our laws and making sure they get the assistance they need to comply.,80,,
460,0.97,3983.179,3985.414,I think that is what we are looking at there.,80,,
461,0.97,3985.414,3988.017,Thank you.,81,,
462,0.97,3988.017,4006.736,"One last question, in terms of timing, is this something, Council President, you would like for us to discuss and consider for today and then we will be voting at the next committee meeting?",81,,
463,0.97,4006.736,4007.603,Is your hope?,81,,
464,0.97,4007.603,4013.009,I like to vote this out of committee today and have a go to full Council on Monday the 14th.,82,,
465,0.97,4013.009,4027.256,", I thought perhaps there was an opportunity for a delay to the next meeting, I apologize for that, it sounds like wires may have gotten crossed with my understanding of the Timeline.",83,,
466,0.97,4027.256,4050.246,"I think the questions I have about Stakeholder engagement and how folks who are advocates BT also lobbyists, how they are able to Digest this information and then provide us with feedback, I haven't been able to get that yet directly from the folks I have been reaching out to.",83,,
467,0.97,4050.246,4058.554,"Is this something you were hoping, director Burnett, would be on the books for 2021 to affect the 2021 election cycle?",83,,
468,0.97,4058.687,4072.201,"Actually, like I said, we initially sent this over last January with the hope's we could have 2020 which is an off election year to ramp this up.",84,,
469,0.97,4072.201,4079.275,2021 as we learned yesterday is going to be another hotly contested election year.,84,,
470,0.97,4079.275,4087.383,"This is not landing at the best time for us, I'm going to be frank about that.",84,,
471,0.97,4087.383,4091.687,We are going to have a lot of energy this year going towards 2021 elections.,84,,
472,0.97,4091.687,4098.594,"I think, this does have a six month effective date.",84,,
473,0.97,4098.594,4105.1,"I don't think it's good to be effective for six months, is to give us the time we need to get all our ducks in a row.",84,,
474,0.97,4105.1,4107.236,"Did that answer your question, I hope so.",84,,
475,0.97,4107.236,4112.608,"Thank you, Madam chair.",85,,
476,0.97,4112.608,4115.411,"Yeah, I think that helped answer my question.",85,,
477,0.97,4115.411,4133.529,"If this were to pass, committee today, full Council on Monday, then you have a six month ramp in to make this effective and you plan to do outreach and education with Stakeholders and affected parties over the next six months.",85,,
478,0.97,4133.529,4133.929,Yes.,86,,
479,0.97,4133.929,4137.566,To the extent we can.,86,,
480,0.97,4137.566,4139.602,To the extent we are not overwhelmed with elections work.,86,,
481,0.97,4139.602,4147.877,"That is also part of the puzzle, a person on board devoted to the lobbying.",86,,
482,0.97,4147.877,4149.278,Go ahead.,87,,
483,0.97,4149.278,4165.661,"I was going to add that I know the Commission is also considering and anticipating changes to the democracy program as well, it will require additional coverage and education to the public and campaigns to work on those issues.",88,,
484,0.97,4165.661,4192.521,"Is going to be a combination of issues that are substantive and the changes next year recommended by the Commission, I would just echo the directors priority in terms of getting as early of a start as possible because I do think the education period has proven to be really helpful for those affected by the changes we recommend.",88,,
485,0.97,4192.521,4198.494,The Commission's goal was to have this in place for 2020.,89,,
486,0.97,4198.494,4202.398,We are now one year behind.,89,,
487,0.97,4202.398,4205.601,That is just the reality of what our situation is.,89,,
488,0.97,4205.601,4238.133,"I want to make sure that Wayne and Nick, we get an opportunity to hear from you directly, but there is a lot of--the Council in particular, and I think the Mayor's office and departments do this, there is a lot of what we call Stakeholder engagement or something we refer to as Stakeholder, I dislike that word but I will use it for this Committee.",89,,
489,0.97,4238.133,4248.877,So I think it is fair to say that in those Stakeholder engagement prophecies there is a mixture of people.,89,,
490,0.97,4248.877,4251.38,There are some people in the Stakeholder environments who are actually lobbyists.,89,,
491,0.97,4251.38,4252.648,"Some are registered, some are not.",89,,
492,0.97,4252.648,4258.153,But they are lobbyists who are engaging in a Stakeholder process of outreach and engagement.,89,,
493,0.97,4258.153,4318.113,"There are also people in Stakeholder engagement processes that are just advocates or volunteers or activists within their community who are engaging with Councilmembers at our request because we want to get their input . My understanding around grassroots lobbying regulations is that that changes nothing as it relates to directed action between those individuals and Councilmembers because the grassroots lobbying regulation we are considering today are about how lobbyists, who spend a certain amount of money in a particular period of time, are lobbying members of the public to mobilize those members of the public to influence legislation.",89,,
494,0.97,4318.113,4320.516,So can you just help us understand that distinction right there?,89,,
495,0.97,4320.516,4321.417,There is the direct contact?,89,,
496,0.97,4321.417,4321.817,Elected official.,89,,
497,0.97,4321.817,4324.42,And interested people.,89,,
498,0.97,4324.42,4345.14,And then there is what lobbying groups do to mobilize members of the public and influence public opinion to contact us directly or indirectly for purposes of influencing the outcome of legislation.,89,,
499,0.97,4345.14,4363.859,"Yes, I think you are right, one of the unfortunate realities is when the state without the this law in the 1970s, it was called grassroots lobbying, I think a more appropriate term is in direct.",90,,
500,0.97,4363.859,4365.461,It is a contrast to direct lobbying.,90,,
501,0.97,4365.461,4369.364,"Direct lobbying is someone paid by someone, not saying Hey we would love you to support this but is Lacing.",90,,
502,0.97,4369.364,4387.616,"In direct lobbying is a program of education to the public saying, please call the Council president and tell her you don't like Constable--Council built X or this tax proposal or any of those things.",90,,
503,0.97,4387.616,4394.289,"Grassroots, it's an unfortunate name because I think we all have positive Annotations when we think of grassroots.",90,,
504,0.97,4394.289,4399.795,But it is just in direct lobbying.,90,,
505,0.97,4399.795,4402.631,"It's not them contacting you directly, it's encouraging others to do so.",90,,
506,0.97,4402.631,4406.435,And spending money to do that.,90,,
507,0.97,4406.435,4444.072,"Yeah, and the indirect lobbying that is being encouraged, the person who actually clicks on the link and sends us that Email or make that phone call, it doesn't have to register as a lobbyist, it's the people who pay for the campaign, indirect lobbying campaign who under this legislation, required to register and disclose expenditures and where they are getting the money from so there is increased transparency.",91,,
508,0.97,4444.072,4447.943,We all know who is footing the bill.,91,,
509,0.97,4447.943,4449.144,"Yes, exactly.",92,,
510,0.97,4449.144,4455.651,I wonder and how much that bill is.,92,,
511,0.97,4455.651,4457.052,And how much that bill is.,93,,
512,0.97,4457.052,4458.22,Currently that's not what's happening.,93,,
513,0.97,4458.22,4471.066,"Right now indirect lobbying happens with no disclosures, or Ho is responsible f expenditure, is that correct?",93,,
514,0.97,4471.066,4476.572,That is correct.,94,,
515,0.97,4476.572,4492.821,"And then Lish, can you quickly describe for us again what the triggers are for who would be required to make the disclosure under the direct lobbying proposal?",94,,
516,0.97,4492.821,4517.613,"So it applies to any person, which under election law and other laws means companies, Nonprofits, organizations, who spend at least $750 and up or $1500 over the course of three months.",95,,
517,0.97,4517.613,4519.615,On lobbying campaigns.,95,,
518,0.97,4519.615,4528.924,That is consistent with a base threshold.,95,,
519,0.97,4528.924,4535.464,Excellent.,96,,
520,0.97,4535.464,4550.379,"And again, I just want to make sure the people who are interested in doing indirect lobbying but are paying for the indirect lobbying, nothing is changing for those individuals.",96,,
521,0.97,4550.379,4563.292,"Someone will call to give us public testimony, they don't really have to register as a lobbyist or someone doing interactive lobbying.",96,,
522,0.97,4563.292,4572.668,"If you post something on your Facebook page encouraging your friends to help city council item, you are not going to be covered by this threshold.",97,,
523,0.97,4572.801,4596.625,"I think, the policy concern is are we creating that does this legislation, would it create a chilling effect to those people who want to exercise the first amendment rights to give public testimony, get public comment or otherwise influence legislation, right?",98,,
524,0.97,4596.625,4616.111,"So if it's just Whoever, whoever has 20 of the closest friends and they did a phone tree and called everyone to lobby us, I think the concern is with there be a chilling effect of sort of a natural organizing of community to advocate for a particular thing?",98,,
525,0.97,4616.244,4622.384,I think you summarized it correctly.,99,,
526,0.97,4622.384,4633.862,The piece that both Wayne and Lish have added is the expenditure piece.,99,,
527,0.97,4633.862,4636.698,It's getting at the money and transparency around organizing efforts to influence legislation.,99,,
528,0.97,4636.698,4645.407,"If a group of volunteers or organizing a phone tree as you indicated, to simply reach out to elected officials, that is not going to fall within this law.",99,,
529,0.97,4645.407,4656.351,It's really just getting it organizing efforts and where money is spent by those efforts to influence the elected officials and legislation they are considering.,99,,
530,0.97,4656.351,4657.352,Great.,100,,
531,0.97,4657.352,4663.025,I appreciate the additional Clarifications.,100,,
532,0.97,4663.025,4681.91,"I do think you can get confusing when you're reading this because of the word grassroots lobbying, it makes it seem like it's about the person who takes up the request to lobby, and really it's about the people paying for the campaign that we are asking to be disclosed.",100,,
533,0.97,4681.91,4686.415,"To me, that is really important.",100,,
534,0.97,4686.415,4695.69,"It is consistent with some of the legislative action this Council has taken around increasing transparency, particularly around legal campaigns.",100,,
535,0.97,4695.69,4699.628,And other editorial issues.,100,,
536,0.97,4699.628,4733.462,"I really do see this as an important piece and they recognize in some instances this will impact people who may have favorable of what we are doing but just because the position is favorable doesn't mitigate the need for public, for the public to have the right to that transparency, who is effectively the fiscal sponsor of that indirect lobbying to members of the public.",100,,
537,0.97,4733.462,4742.537,I think it's really important for us to advance this is a further tool to maximize integrity of our elections and Governance system.,100,,
538,0.97,4742.537,4758.186,"At the city, and of course from the city council's perspective, we are certainly subjected to a lot of indirect lobbying from a lot of folks and sometimes it's unclear where that is coming from.",100,,
539,0.97,4758.186,4775.604,I am happy to support this legislation and to be listed as a prime sponsor and I feel very prepared and ready to support it today and ask the full Council to do the same on Monday the 14th.,100,,
540,0.97,4775.604,4786.014,"So barring a motion to hold this, I'm going to make a motion for us to consider it.",100,,
541,0.97,4786.014,4786.615,Councilmember Juarez?,100,,
542,0.97,4786.615,4812.24,"I do support what you shared, this is in alignment with state law and I think the other issue on the policy piece is Washington has always been a blue skies state, for the state and certainly for the city and transparency.",101,,
543,0.97,4812.24,4817.112,Lobbying direct and indirect has become more sophisticated and I think it's important we know who gets paid when they come to city hall.,101,,
544,0.97,4817.112,4830.826,"You're right, it's an unfortunate because people here grassroots and they think we are doing a chilling effect of people coming for issues that are important in actual grassroots, but it's the indirect lobbying peace and who is getting paid that I think we need to address.",101,,
545,0.97,4830.826,4833.428,I'm happy to support that today.,101,,
546,0.97,4833.428,4835.03,Thank you.,102,,
547,0.97,4835.03,4838.466,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Juarez.",103,,
548,0.97,4838.466,4842.17,"Sorry, you know the drill.",104,,
549,0.97,4842.17,4850.745,"Thank you very much, I want to appreciate the Council president and the directive for bringing this forward.",104,,
550,0.97,4850.745,4857.752,I also agree is in line with what the city has done and protections.,104,,
551,0.97,4857.752,4862.49,"I, unfortunately that we had extra time.",104,,
552,0.97,4862.49,4863.825,So I had sought additional feedback.,104,,
553,0.97,4863.825,4868.863,Am supportive of the direction.,104,,
554,0.97,4868.863,4871.867,I'm going to abstain today with the intent of getting the questions answered by Monday.,104,,
555,0.97,4871.867,4887.115,I think it's a great direction we are headed in to create Daylighting of where some of his information is COMI while also not Impeding anyone's ability to engage in indirect lobbying.,104,,
556,0.97,4887.115,4887.782,I appreciate that.,104,,
557,0.97,4887.782,4890.185,I wanted to give you that background for my vote today.,104,,
558,0.97,4890.185,4891.386,That is fine.,105,,
559,0.97,4891.386,4902.797,"Lish's memo, for what it's worth, at the very bottom did say we are going to vote this out of committee today for consideration on 14 December.",105,,
560,0.97,4902.797,4905.4,I think that was published on Friday with the agenda.,105,,
561,0.97,4905.4,4915.01,I apologize if there was some other message being sent Besides that.,105,,
562,0.97,4915.01,4917.679,I'm happy to continue to have conversations with you in the background.,105,,
563,0.97,4917.679,4922.517,"As you get information, and is any other issues may arise.",105,,
564,0.97,4922.517,4924.819,For now I'm going to call this up for a vote.,105,,
565,0.97,4924.819,4928.456,Since I think it looks like we have concluded debate.,105,,
566,0.97,4928.456,4937.832,"Council members, I move the committee recommend passage of Council bill 119968, is there a second?",105,,
567,0.97,4937.832,4938.233,Second.,106,,
