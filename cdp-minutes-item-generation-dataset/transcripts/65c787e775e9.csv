893,0.97,4669.998,4674.102,This resolution urges the Mayor and governor to extend the moratorium on Evictions to at least the end of this year.,159,,
894,0.97,4674.102,4685.647,This resolution last came for a vote on March 15th . two weeks before the city and state moratoriums were poised to expire.,159,,
895,0.97,4685.647,4695.657,"At that time, Renters were terrified that they could lose their homes in two weeks, and housing activists and organizations demanded that the Mayor and the governor extend the moratorium to the end of the year.",159,,
896,0.97,4695.657,4704.666,"Minutes before the city council meeting on that day whether resolution was going to be voted on, Mayor Durkan relented and extended the moratorium for an additional three months.",159,,
897,0.97,4704.666,4708.97,"Later, Governor Inslee did the same.",159,,
898,0.97,4708.97,4722.451,"As we said at that time, this was a victory for the Renters' rights struggle, but it was also only a partial victory because it was extending the moratorium to only three months.",159,,
899,0.97,4722.451,4727.155,"I proposed that the time, and the Council unanimously agreed, to delay the vote on the resolution until today, June 7th.",159,,
900,0.97,4727.155,4734.196,Because Eviction moratoriums are now going to expire on June 30th unless they are extended.,159,,
901,0.97,4734.196,4740.268,"Like in March, the Eviction moratoriums are permitted to expire at the end of this month, it will spell a real disaster for Renters.",159,,
902,0.97,4740.268,4753.682,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau's survey, 270,000 Washington state Renters have little to no confidence that they will be able to pay rent next month, which is 18% of all state Renters.",159,,
903,0.97,4753.682,4762.424,"98,000 Washington state Renters think it is very, or somewhat likely, that they will be evicted in the next two months.",159,,
904,0.97,4762.424,4777.038,"Already as public, at testimonials have stated and as I have said in my comment in previous weeks, the data from the real estate industry in Seattle itself shows that rents are starting to skyrocket.",159,,
905,0.97,4777.038,4788.75,"Starting in January already, and that they are projected to increase at a greater rate than the rents were going up in the Pre-Pandemic period.",159,,
906,0.97,4788.75,4797.959,"So, Renters are facing a dire situation both in terms of keeping up with current rent, not to mention the debt that they are being forced to accumulate.",159,,
907,0.97,4797.959,4803.665,We have fought for and won the right to a lawyer for Renters facing Eviction.,159,,

909,0.97,4810.772,4814.976,"All of those are extremely important, but none of them are an excuse to fail to extend the Eviction moratorium.",159,,
910,0.97,4814.976,4823.985,"When the Eviction moratorium ends, literally thousands of Seattle Renters could be served with Eviction paperwork, which is also known as unlawful Detainer is.",159,,
911,0.97,4823.985,4840.769,"An unknown number will set The., moving before they are finally served with the Eviction paperwork, then statistically half of those actually served with formal Eviction paperwork will be evicted by default because they're unable to respond to the paperwork or appear in court.",159,,
912,0.97,4840.769,4849.711,"Only those who make it to the Eviction hearing can avoid Eviction using Seattle's Eviction defense, write to counsel and rental assistance.",159,,
913,0.97,4849.711,4855.016,I oppose Evictions because housing should be a human right.,159,,
914,0.97,4855.016,4866.428,"At the very least however, the housing emergency Renters are facing due to the economic shock of Covid-19 needs to be resolved before elected officials even consider lifting the Eviction moratorium.",159,,

919,0.97,4891.987,4894.022,Can I get a second?,159,,
920,0.97,4894.022,4896.458,Is there a second?,159,,
921,0.97,4896.458,4898.526,Second.,159,,
922,0.97,4898.526,4899.961,It has been moved and Seconded.,159,,
923,0.97,4899.961,4900.829,Councilmember Sawant.,159,,
924,0.97,4900.829,4910.872,The amendment adds Up-To- date statistics and also language on recent community organizing.,160,,
925,0.97,4910.872,4932.26,"For example"" from a Washington community action network outreach letter quote, we are calling for an extension of the Eviction moratorium to the end of the year to make sure Renters have time to access rental relief programs, get back to their normal incomes, and can get caught up on rent.",160,,
926,0.97,4932.26,4938.166,"We want some important policies in the state Legislature, but to make sure those policies are effective, we need to ensure Renters have time to catch up on rent.",160,,
927,0.97,4938.166,4948.91,"End quote the amended resolution also quote from a Washington low income housing alliance letter stating quote, incredible numbers of Renters are applying for rental assistance and it will take months to get the funds distributed.",160,,
928,0.97,4948.91,4956.985,Lifting the moratorium and allowing landlords to proceed with Evictions a month from now would be grossly irresponsible end quote.,160,,
929,0.97,4956.985,4969.597,"Frankly, it is, I agree with them it is not acceptable that elected officials would even consider lifting the moratorium before Renters I able to get caught up on their passed rent and stabilize their lives after this was unprecedented emergency.",160,,
930,0.97,4969.597,4983.211,The amendment also accounts for the tenant bill 5160 that shamefully ends the Eviction moratorium statewide on June 30th.,160,,
931,0.97,4983.211,4996.157,"While the statewide moratorium is scheduled at this moment to end on June 30th, according to Senate bill 5160, there is nothing legally stopping governor Inslee from issuing a new moratorium proclamation.",160,,
932,0.97,4996.157,4998.727,And Senate bill 5160 says nothing about the city's moratorium.,160,,
933,0.97,4998.727,5015.677,"I urge Councilmembers to support this amendment, updating the resolution language, and also to support the resolution as a whole, but at this time, I think we have the first vote on the amendment to update the language and then the vote on the resolution as a whole.",160,,
934,0.97,5015.677,5016.945,I'll just have some closing comments later.,160,,
935,0.97,5016.945,5020.148,Thank you so much.,160,,
936,0.97,5020.148,5024.986,That's exactly how we are going to handle this.,161,,
937,0.97,5024.986,5036.398,"Before we call the roll on proposed amendment one, I would like to offer other Councilmembers an opportunity to ask any questions or make any comments about proposed amendment one as published on the agenda.",161,,

940,0.97,5067.495,5074.102,"Okay, the amendment passes.",163,,
941,0.97,5074.102,5080.508,"The motion carries, the amendment is adopted and the amended resolution is now before the city council.",163,,
942,0.97,5080.508,5099.861,"Are there any additional comments on the resolution as amended, and of course Councilmember Sawant, as the prime sponsor you will get the last word all right,'s scanning the zoom room for any hands and I'm not seeing any hands raised, so Councilman the Sawant, you get the last word.",163,,
943,0.97,5099.861,5102.43,You can closeout debate and we will call this to a vote.,163,,
944,0.97,5102.43,5103.031,Thank you.,164,,
945,0.97,5103.031,5115.443,I just wanted to add the New York Times editorial board recently wrote an editorial with the Orwellian title to prevent Evictions and moratoriums.,164,,
946,0.97,5115.443,5127.255,This editorial advocates for ending Eviction moratoriums around the country by making the neoliberal Bootstraps argument that poor Renters need the threat of Eviction to be motivated to access rental assistance money.,164,,
947,0.97,5127.255,5139.834,"We know that such neoliberal arguments have no truth, and when you look at overwhelming statistical evidence, but we also know this is a new line of the corporate establishment now.",164,,
948,0.97,5139.834,5153.114,"We are seeing it being used around the country to Renters' rights from Philadelphia to Olympia, and is being used as a thing against any advocacy of extending the Eviction moratoriums.",164,,
949,0.97,5153.114,5157.886,Nationally.,164,,
950,0.97,5157.886,5160.722,The reality is that rental assistance agencies need time to distribute rental assistance funds.,164,,
951,0.97,5160.722,5162.824,Renters do not need the threat of Eviction.,164,,
952,0.97,5162.824,5165.727,Renters need some guarantees that they will not lose their homes.,164,,
953,0.97,5165.727,5172.734,"As Progressives, we have a duty to push back against this neoliberal narrative.",164,,
954,0.97,5172.734,5178.64,Housing should be a human right nd not used as leverage like the New York Times editorial board proposes.,164,,
955,0.97,5178.64,5194.155,I would urge that we send a clear message to the governor's and the Mayor's offices of the Seattle city council support Renters and community organizations and demanding that the moratorium be extended through at least the end of this year.,164,,
956,0.97,5194.155,5194.455,Thank you.,164,,
957,0.97,5194.455,5202.063,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Sawant for those closing comments.",165,,

970,0.97,5286.714,5296.724,"This is the legislation from my office banning the Eviction of schoolchildren, their families and educators during the school year.",170,,
971,0.97,5296.724,5307.168,"It is common sense, but there are also mountains of research showing that when children are evicted it has devastating impact on their academic achievement and their development and mental health.",170,,
972,0.97,5307.168,5326.254,"For example, the losing home report found that quote, of evicted respondents of School- aged children, 85.7% said their children had to move schools after the Eviction, and 87.5% reported their children's school performance suffered very much because of the Eviction, end quote.",170,,
973,0.97,5326.254,5338.499,"In 2018, the state found that nearly 4200 Seattle public school children were homeless at some point during the school year.",170,,
974,0.97,5338.499,5345.673,"That is a staggering 7% of all public school children, and a practical terms it means that in an average class of 30 students, two will be homeless at some point during the school year.",170,,
975,0.97,5345.673,5349.41,This is a racial justice and black lives matter issue as well.,170,,
976,0.97,5349.41,5365.727,"Just as Seattle landlords Evict black tenants at much higher rates than other tenants, we also see that black students and other students of color disproportionately face homelessness and we should make sure of course to understand the causal link between Evictions and the likelihood of ending up homeless.",170,,
977,0.97,5365.727,5377.038,"We know the losing home report found that 9 times out of 10, Evictions result in homelessness.",170,,
978,0.97,5377.038,5387.648,"Fully 40% of homeless students were black and 2018, and 23% of homeless students were Latinx, even though those communities constitute only 14% and 12% respectively of Seattle's public student population.",170,,
979,0.97,5387.648,5396.557,"Preventing school year Evictions will reduce at least this one form of systemic racism, that is affecting our students.",170,,
980,0.97,5396.557,5404.665,"In the class of 2018 for example, 55.2% of homeless students graduated on time, compared to 85--84.5% of students who were housed.",170,,
981,0.97,5404.665,5417.545,We see a dramatic impact of homelessness and Evictions on children graduation rates.,170,,
982,0.97,5417.545,5423.985,The academic research into the impact of Eviction and housing instability on students and children is also revealed.,170,,
983,0.97,5423.985,5448.409,"For example, the negative effects of instability on child development report published by the urban Institute found that quote, children experiencing residential instability demonstrate worse academic and social outcomes than their residentially stable peers, such as lower vocabulary skills, problem behaviors, grade retention, increased high school dropout rates, and lower adult education attainment.",170,,
984,0.97,5448.409,5451.813,End quote.,170,,
985,0.97,5451.813,5455.116,Similarly research shows that turnover in school staff significantly harms the school's effectiveness.,170,,
986,0.97,5455.116,5469.13,"That is why this is such a strong bill where it includes not only schoolchildren, but all educators, staff, in public schools, on public school campuses.",170,,

1008,0.97,5601.662,5604.465,Second.,178,,

1013,0.97,5623.818,5625.486,For a vote today.,180,,
1014,0.97,5625.486,5636.664,I'm very supportive of the underlying bill and I want to thank her for her work with me as I brought forward a potential idea for amendment.,180,,
1015,0.97,5636.664,5642.203,"We had some other ideas that we would have like to include that we will continue to work on, and I make NOTE on that here very soon.",180,,
1016,0.97,5642.203,5653.314,Wanted to do everything that we could to address some of the potential concerns that have been coming up for a very small sector of the community that has raised some concerns about the potential unintended impact to housing stability.,180,,
1017,0.97,5653.314,5662.189,In a very rare situation that there is a homeowner who has a financial limitation or other life circumstance that necessitates them to potentially move back into their homes.,180,,
1018,0.97,5662.189,5672.233,"Colleagues, this is a very similar to the very narrow situation that we have included in the just care statute that is already in effect.",180,,
1019,0.97,5672.233,5687.248,"The amendment that I have circulated for your consideration today, which is outlined in amendment number two, is trying to make sure that we are addressing this very narrow concern and applying an owner moved in as an example during the school year moratorium.",180,,
1020,0.97,5687.248,5696.357,"This has been discussed with housing activists, tenants rights organizations, and members of the labor community.",180,,
1021,0.97,5696.357,5717.211,"I think overall, there is a broad understanding and desire to make sure that this bill moves forward, and the passed today, which I'm strongly supportive of, and that it continues to address the concerns that are coming up about potential misuse of any of the exemption statutes across the board, which I'm very committed to and consummate the Sawant and I had extensive discussions about.",180,,
1022,0.97,5717.211,5719.18,We will continue to work on that.,180,,
1023,0.97,5719.18,5744.105,"And see that if there is a situation that arises for these individuals who happen to be very small landlords with one of these housing units that they do need to move back into, given their financial limitations or other hardships, and life circumstances, that we apply the very same language that we already have included in the other two pieces of legislation in front of us today.",180,,
1024,0.97,5744.105,5746.373,And that we Vardy included in the just cause legislation as well.,180,,
1025,0.97,5746.373,5764.825,"I want to be very clear, that this just cause addition here that we are talking about is not--is just for the owner move in as a just reason for efficient.",180,,
1026,0.97,5764.825,5773.501,"This is not a loophole as there is many reasons that many owners could need to move into their homes including life changes like the birth of a child, the loss of a job which so many folks have experience, illness or relocation.",180,,
1027,0.97,5773.501,5786.747,"These cases, which we expect to be very few, have meant that some of the owners who have--some of these Renter units are concerned about their own ability have housing stability.",180,,
1028,0.97,5786.747,5797.958,The amendment would add in the owner move in exemption for owners to require them to give the 90 days notice and to make sure that they are adhering to the requirements within the just cause language.,180,,
1029,0.97,5797.958,5815.042,"This narrow amendment is intended to be a response to those consents we've heard about possibly having instability in the housing market in those very few circumstances where some of these very small landlords are income restricted with one single residence, and maybe they can't depend on that residence anymore.",180,,
1030,0.97,5815.042,5821.282,"Site, their income anymore and they need to move into their own family's home.",180,,
1031,0.97,5821.282,5829.757,"We know that Seattle's high cost of housing, there are few circumstances of the owner may not have the financial means to line up other housing options for the length of time potentially required in the legislation as it is currently written.",180,,
1032,0.97,5829.757,5836.096,"In these very narrow circumstances, we are hoping that this helped to create greater housing stability for folks in this specific situation.",180,,
1033,0.97,5836.096,5845.906,I really appreciate that there is a ongoing conversation that we have begun to address here today with the legislation in front of us.,180,,
1034,0.97,5845.906,5849.31,Through the other ordinances that we are continuing to pass today.,180,,
1035,0.97,5849.31,5857.017,And that there is a clear understanding that we need to make sure that our language around owner move in's is strengthened.,180,,
1036,0.97,5857.017,5865.226,That we make sure that those penalties for people who are violating any of these narrow exemptions that we have written into the statute.,180,,
1037,0.97,5865.226,5877.938,"I noted earlier Dan Council briefing I am very interested in treble damages, making sure that Renters received triple the amount of their rent that would otherwise be paid to come in the form of rent had they stayed in the place.",180,,
1038,0.97,5877.938,5880.207,If there is any violation of the ordinance.,180,,
1039,0.97,5880.207,5888.916,"Also, that we seek to enhance the enforcement statute by requiring private right of action that includes any damages.",180,,
1040,0.97,5888.916,5894.455,"As well, be paid to the Renter.",180,,
1041,0.97,5894.455,5900.794,"I think that many of these things are on the horizon for us to work on, they will apply broadly to the other data protection bill that we are considering today.",180,,
1042,0.97,5900.794,5902.963,And the just cause language that is already on the books.,180,,
1043,0.97,5902.963,5916.51,"I know that there is much more work to be done and I am hoping that in the case of this piece of legislation, unfortunately we were not able to include some of the stronger enforcement provisions that Councilman the salon and I had been working on due to the time limitations.",180,,
1044,0.97,5916.51,5919.98,"But, I am very committed to voting on this bill today, did not want to hold it up.",180,,
1045,0.97,5919.98,5926.487,Greatly appreciate that it is in front of us today.,180,,
1046,0.97,5926.487,5932.793,"We know how urgently needed it is and in an effort to move forward this no provision, I am asking for your support on amendment number two.",180,,
1047,0.97,5932.793,5944.605,"With the commitment, with the full throw the commitment that we continue to make sure that there are stronger enforcement standards related to the Department's ability to make sure that those are adhering to are just cause language.",180,,
1048,0.97,5944.605,5954.915,"I do want to thank Aaron house for the work that she has done with Council member Sawant's office and a broad swath of Stakeholders including from the tenants right groups, labor organizations, housing rights groups, as well.",180,,
1049,0.97,5954.915,5958.018,I think there is broad understanding that alone this is not enough.,180,,
1050,0.97,5958.018,5967.394,That this moratorium including language from this amendment needs to be coupled with rental relief and repayment for small landlords.,180,,
1051,0.97,5967.394,5973.901,"One memo we received said this moratorium is important, it's nice, but it doesn't stop rent debt from accumulating.",180,,
1052,0.97,5973.901,5978.405,Rent relief and other forms of monetary support will definitely help.,180,,
1053,0.97,5978.405,5991.719,"And is much needed, and that colleagues who are providing assistance for Seattle public school students with immediate health, safety and housing and educational needs, show that rent and housing support is one of the highest requests where most of their money goes.",180,,
1054,0.97,5991.719,6014.708,"So, excited to pass this legislation, hopeful that we can include this narrow addition here today and we know that there is much more to do, both in terms of improving enforcement standards from the Department, and also making sure that we do more with rental assistance in the rental, excuse me with the Federal relief dollars and we will continue to address in this fall's supplemental budget process.",180,,
1055,0.97,6014.708,6019.346,"So, thank you very much for your consideration today.",180,,
1056,0.97,6019.346,6022.082,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda for the introduction of proposed amendment two.",181,,
1057,0.97,6022.082,6030.09,Are there any additional comments or questions about proposed amendment two?,181,,
1058,0.97,6030.09,6030.958,"Councilmember Sawant, please.",181,,
1059,0.97,6030.958,6037.398,"Thank you, president Gonzalez, thank you Councilmember Mosqueda.",182,,
1060,0.97,6037.398,6040.467,I really appreciate Councilmember Mosqueda talking through this amendment.,182,,
1061,0.97,6040.467,6043.771,With me in a very careful manner.,182,,
1062,0.97,6043.771,6064.091,"I really appreciate the commitment to not holding up the vote because obviously overall, I would say on Renters' rights, the city has real work to do in terms of making sure that the laws we pass in favor of tenant protections are actually enforced.",182,,
1063,0.97,6064.091,6073.6,"That's a larger conversation that I would really be interested in having, and something that my staff and I have been discussing with Renters and Renters activists over the years.",182,,
1064,0.97,6073.6,6091.452,"As I've informed Councilmember Mosqueda, I'm not going to be supporting adding this loophole to this schoolchildren Eviction band that would allow landlords to Evict children in the middle of the school year in order to move themselves or their family members and to the property.",182,,
1065,0.97,6091.452,6094.455,I agree that this is very likely only a very narrow issue.,182,,
1066,0.97,6094.455,6110.37,"I also agree that if it's applied in such a way that only small landlords who are facing this specific difficult kind of situation, then it's not--you cannot characterize it as a loophole.",182,,
1067,0.97,6110.37,6113.574,The reason I would be concerned about it is two fold.,182,,
1068,0.97,6113.574,6126.153,"One is I don't think it is needed because with little foresight, with a little foresight, landlords should be able to arrange to move in over the summer so that they don't force a child to move during the school year.",182,,
1069,0.97,6126.153,6132.459,It also entails having to move schools in the middle of the school year.,182,,
1070,0.97,6132.459,6136.563,That is an onerous burden to put on a child.,182,,
1071,0.97,6136.563,6149.61,"So, sorry, in that sense I, probably this may not arise very often, but I would also be concerned that it may not be used by genuine landlords.",182,,
1072,0.97,6149.61,6164.825,"Again, that brings up the overall question of enforcement and the concern that an unscrupulous landlord might use a falsehood saying they intend to move into the unit.",182,,
1073,0.97,6164.825,6167.628,They actually have no intention of actually occupying.,182,,
1074,0.97,6167.628,6172.733,"After the fact, it's impossible for the Renters, or nearly impossible to figure out and follow-up.",182,,
1075,0.97,6172.733,6174.935,Get reparations for it.,182,,
1076,0.97,6174.935,6184.845,"Also, I think this amendment would allow any building owner, not just small ones, to move themselves or their family members into the unit.",182,,
1077,0.97,6184.845,6195.055,"So, I still agree that it is probably not going to be very damaging, but at the same time, I would hesitate to be party to opening that door.",182,,
1078,0.97,6195.055,6202.763,That's why I will not support this amendment at this time.,182,,
1079,0.97,6202.763,6209.369,"I really appreciate Councilmember Mosqueda's interest in improving the enforcement in the future, and as I said before, my office has been eager to look into Renters' rights enforcement overall.",182,,
1080,0.97,6209.369,6218.645,"This is something that we would really be happy to follow up with you, Councilmember Mosqueda, and in the other Councilmember who wants to look into this.",182,,
1081,0.97,6218.645,6230.691,"I also wanted to share with you as the public, that I've discussed with a small landlord who is facing a specific situation that sounds extremely problematic.",182,,
1082,0.97,6230.691,6235.696,"It is an Outlier situation, but nonetheless it seems like a very troubling situation.",182,,
1083,0.97,6235.696,6240.2,"But, the landlord also themselves agreed that it is an Outlier situation.",182,,
1084,0.97,6240.2,6246.406,I also wanted to express public appreciation for the small landlord saying that they really support Renters' rights as a whole.,182,,
1085,0.97,6246.406,6259.386,"That they had some specific concerns, and that they would be willing to speak out in favor of Renters' rights as a whole because as a small landlord, they understand and appreciate the need for Renters' rights to be strengthened.",182,,
1086,0.97,6259.386,6262.089,Thank you.,182,,
1087,0.97,6262.089,6270.03,"Okay, any other comments or questions on proposed amendment two?",183,,
1088,0.97,6270.03,6279.406,Looks like there are no other comments from other Councilmembers.,183,,
1089,0.97,6279.406,6283.844,"Councilmember Mosqueda you have the last word if you could close out debate on proposed amendment two, that would be great.",183,,
1090,0.97,6283.844,6285.445,We can call it to a vote.,183,,
1091,0.97,6285.445,6298.825,"Thank you very much, and I just wanted to thank Councilmmber Sawant for her comments as well as we look forward to strengthening overall enforcement monitoring and really compliance with legislation that's already on the books.",184,,
1092,0.97,6298.825,6308.135,I think that's important as we also look to expand the moratoriums that are in place because we want to make sure that folks are adhering to the existing laws.,184,,
1093,0.97,6308.135,6317.077,"As we allow for greater protections for tenants, that everybody knows folks have rights and responsibilities.",184,,
1094,0.97,6317.077,6323.75,"I look forward to that future conversation, thank you, Councilmember Sawant for continuing to push for broadening the enforcement element of this, which I will be there with you to further those discussions.",184,,
1095,0.97,6323.75,6330.891,I really appreciate also that folks are acknowledging that this is a very narrow situation that we are talking about here.,184,,
1096,0.97,6330.891,6332.192,Infrequent situation.,184,,
1097,0.97,6332.192,6336.997,There have been a number of Emails that we have received.,184,,
1098,0.97,6336.997,6355.782,"There's a few stories, one example of correspondence that we received was a family who has been living with other family, but they have since welcomed a new baby and has always intended to move back in the home that they have purchased and don't have the means to both pay for a mortgage and take on additional debt.",184,,
1099,0.97,6355.782,6356.35,"Work, housing costs.",184,,
1100,0.97,6356.35,6366.893,"Want to reiterate that this is intending to try to find stability in the overall market, though we are very, very clear that the overall intent of this legislation is tremendously Impactful.",184,,
1101,0.97,6366.893,6372.399,Very strongly in support of the folks who have been advocated for this.,184,,
1102,0.97,6372.399,6376.436,"The housing and tenant folks, to Seattle education and Martin Luther King County labor Council.",184,,
1103,0.97,6376.436,6383.543,"Really appreciate the strong coalition that is supporting this legislation today, and so this very narrow amendment is again, from our perspective, not a loophole.",184,,
1104,0.97,6383.543,6402.129,"There's lots of language that we already--that has already included this type of--this type of allowance, which also includes the two other bills we are talking about today that look specifically at just cause reason for ending Month-To- month agreements.",184,,
1105,0.97,6402.129,6409.836,Which is included in Councilmember Sawant's and Morales' right to refuse a legislation that's also up for a vote this afternoon which I'm very supportive of.,184,,
1106,0.97,6409.836,6433.96,"We are going to be working towards a greater I think broader swath of making sure that all of our enforcement mechanisms are properly in place so that if there is any of these situations in which a lease moves automatically to a month-to-month conversion, that the just cause ordinance and other protections are applied, applied appropriately, and that we are strongly enforcing who is using any of these standards.",184,,
1107,0.97,6433.96,6442.903,"Because this is paramount that we get this right, and with a strong message landlords that they are going to be watched if they're using any of these provisions.",184,,
1108,0.97,6442.903,6450.377,"Overall, housing stability is absolutely the goal of the legislation and the narrow amendment in front of us.",184,,
1109,0.97,6450.377,6458.051,"With that, look forward to supporting the overall bill, and bills in front of us today, and thanks very much Councilmember Sawant for your comments.",184,,

1129,0.97,6506.266,6509.87,"So, I'm going to open it up for general comments.",201,,
1130,0.97,6509.87,6524.885,"Councilmember Sawant, you are the primary sponsor of this bill, so you would get the last word.",201,,
1131,0.97,6524.885,6530.09,"Before that, just want to see if any other Councilmembers have any other comments or would like to make on the bill as amended.",201,,
1132,0.97,6530.09,6533.493,"Councilmember Pedersen, please.",201,,
1133,0.97,6533.493,6537.697,"Thank you, Council President.",202,,
1134,0.97,6537.697,6546.706,"Colleagues, for those of you who are not on the Renters' rights Committee, I offered several amendments, which I believe would make this legislation better.",202,,
1135,0.97,6546.706,6553.98,"Wanted to offer those amendments then, debate those amendments then, a committee, rather than rehash them here.",202,,
1136,0.97,6553.98,6559.686,"But, I do want to explain my vote on this.",202,,
1137,0.97,6559.686,6563.323,I agree with the sponsor of the legislation that Evictions present hardships for children and families.,202,,
1138,0.97,6563.323,6573.033,No one wants to have this disruption that leads to learning laws and instability for children.,202,,
1139,0.97,6573.033,6578.305,"I voted in favor of numerous tenant protections during the passed year, including the winter ban on Evictions for low and moderate income residents.",202,,
1140,0.97,6578.305,6585.111,"Free legal counsel for those in need and facing Eviction, and the payment plans for those negatively impacted by the Covid pandemic.",202,,
1141,0.97,6585.111,6598.058,Today as a part of the resolution to encourage another's extension to the Eviction moratorium to provide more time to have more rental assistance money flow from the Federal and state governments to both housing providers and tenants.,202,,
1142,0.97,6598.058,6605.498,"Before joining the city council I helped to build and preserve tens of thousands of units of low income housing, and I worked at the U.S. Department of housing and urban development.",202,,
1143,0.97,6605.498,6610.637,Helping to allocate billions of dollars to address homelessness throughout the country.,202,,
1144,0.97,6610.637,6616.543,"However, I believe a more targeted, direct and efficient solution is to fund tenant and landlord assistance to those in need.",202,,
1145,0.97,6616.543,6626.486,"Rather than adding another regulation that could be legally challenged because it leaves one party, the providers of the house, bearing the brunt of the cost.",202,,
1146,0.97,6626.486,6646.406,"Regulating, rather than funding the solution on a permanent basis is more likely to have a negative substantial impact not on so-called corporate landlords that can absorb these costs proposed by the counselor, but on the smallest landlords in our city.",202,,
1147,0.97,6646.406,6650.877,"For the three ordinances before us, and offered amendment that would have exempted small landlords owning four or fewer units in Seattle.",202,,
1148,0.97,6650.877,6672.832,"Regarding this bill, 120046, this permanent bill that Singles out educators for special rental protections, one of my amendments would have targeted the bill to assist teachers and substitute teachers and curriculum specialists, rather than every single employee at the school who might not be involved in the direct education of children.",202,,
1149,0.97,6672.832,6680.94,My amendment was to have kept the special new protection for the schoolchildren and their families.,202,,
1150,0.97,6680.94,6689.649,"Another amendment would have made the bill more like the law from San Francisco, which limits Eviction protections to when there is no fault of the tenant who is an educator.",202,,
1151,0.97,6689.649,6697.557,My amendment would have been broader than San Francisco's because it would have still banned the Eviction for school Childre and their families.,202,,
1152,0.97,6697.557,6708.935,Another amendment would have changed this permanent alteration of Landlord-Tenant relations to an 18 month pilot program to determine whether it's effective from what its impact is.,202,,
1153,0.97,6708.935,6713.673,It's important for the general public to know that this bill is different from recent Covid relief bills because it would be permanent.,202,,
1154,0.97,6713.673,6723.983,"I believe we should focus on getting targeted funding to those in need, rather than permanently altering the contractual relationships that put the burden entirely on the housing provider.",202,,
1155,0.97,6723.983,6727.787,"So, to be consistent with my Vo- Tech Committee, I'll be voting no on this Council bill.",202,,
1156,0.97,6727.787,6728.121,Thank you.,202,,
1157,0.97,6728.121,6731.491,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",203,,
1158,0.97,6731.491,6737.864,Are there any other colleagues who would like to make comments on this particular bill?,203,,
1159,0.97,6737.864,6740.066,I'm not seeing any other hands raised.,203,,
1160,0.97,6740.066,6753.079,"So, I did actually want to just add a little bit of context for the bill that we are about to be voting on.",203,,
1161,0.97,6753.079,6756.116,I want to signal that I am very supportive of this particular piece of legislation.,203,,
1162,0.97,6756.116,6768.828,"As a reminder, I have personally sponsored legislation, and we have all supported multiple pieces of legislation over the last year and beyond.",203,,
1163,0.97,6768.828,6773.533,To provide additional rental assistance to people who need it in this space.,203,,
1164,0.97,6773.533,6782.242,"Again, I think it's important to understand that in particular, some of these bills have identified funds.",203,,
1165,0.97,6782.242,6787.347,Very much needed funds to address the issues related to students experiencing homelessness.,203,,
1166,0.97,6787.347,6794.254,And of course keeping students housed has been something that I have personally championed additional resources for.,203,,
1167,0.97,6794.254,6799.325,During the last three years now.,203,,
1168,0.97,6799.325,6813.173,"For example, our family's education preschool promise levy includes, for the first time ever, dedicated funding to the tune of $600,000 a year to address the experience of student homelessness.",203,,
1169,0.97,6813.173,6815.708,We've also provided funding for child care for families experiencing homelessness.,203,,
1170,0.97,6815.708,6829.589,"And we have added language, we added language to the Jumpstart spending plan to require work with small landlords, in addition to language focused on families with school-age children.",203,,
1171,0.97,6829.589,6844.003,Are 2020 budget process ensure that there were additional dollars specifically designated for rental assistance to go to families with School-Aged children of overall rental assistance--for overall rental assistance resources.,203,,
1172,0.97,6844.003,6851.911,"My support of this bill is recognizing that there is a Holistic way for us to continue to support the needs, the housing stability needs of our families and kids.",203,,
1173,0.97,6851.911,6854.113,"Yes, more rental assistance is needed.",203,,
1174,0.97,6854.113,6865.792,"Yes, more dollars to allow for and invest in the family's housing stability is absolutely needed, but that isn't enough.",203,,
1175,0.97,6865.792,6881.341,"We also have an obligation, as policymakers, to fix regulations when regulations are part and parcel of one of the causes for why that housing instability begins and continues to Pervade within our communities.",203,,
1176,0.97,6881.341,6896.456,"So, I'm excited to support this legislation and I look forward to future conversations with all of you who have expressed interest and identifying additional resources to support families experiencing housing instability.",203,,
1177,0.97,6896.456,6901.661,One of the things that my office has been following very closely is spending.,203,,
1178,0.97,6901.661,6907.267,On the family education preschool and promise levy.,203,,
1179,0.97,6907.267,6917.377,One of the things we have begun to learn is that many of the dollars that we have identified to support specifically students experiencing homelessness have not been able to be spent at the level that we expected.,203,,
1180,0.97,6917.377,6925.084,In large part because of At- home learning.,203,,
1181,0.97,6925.084,6931.858,"So, there will be an opportunity for us to potentially work together as a Council to Reprioritize some of those dollars to still meet the needs of students in our public school system.",203,,
1182,0.97,6931.858,6940.5,"But, be very nimble and quick with some stability as a relates to existing revenue resources.",203,,
1183,0.97,6940.5,6944.604,"So, I look forward to having those conversations with you all, and to making sure that we address those concerns.",203,,
1184,0.97,6944.604,6947.407,"So, I'm excited to vote on this bill.",203,,
1185,0.97,6947.407,6950.677,"With that being said, I'm going so want to close out debate.",203,,
1186,0.97,6950.677,6954.414,"Then, we can vote on this bill and move on to the other suite of bills.",203,,
1187,0.97,6954.414,6956.182,"Thank you, president Gonzalez.",204,,
1188,0.97,6956.182,6960.62,I appreciate your comments on this bill and your support of it.,204,,
1189,0.97,6960.62,6967.427,"I just wanted to thank the committee members, Councilmembers Morales and Lewis.",204,,
1190,0.97,6967.427,6980.34,"For standing with Renters in the committee, and voting against the amendments that Councilmember Pedersen brought forward, because they are not in the interest of Renters.",204,,
1191,0.97,6980.34,6996.356,"Specifically I wanted to note that one of the amendments, which would have divided public school workers into well-paid employees, better paid employees, who would have access to this Eviction protection, and others who would not.",204,,
1192,0.97,6996.356,6998.691,"It was important that the committee rejected that amendment, among others.",204,,
1193,0.97,6998.691,7010.069,It is reflected--the ideas and the sentiments of many Rank- And-File workers and union members.,204,,
1194,0.97,7010.069,7015.274,Who stand for solidarity among all public school workers.,204,,
1195,0.97,7015.274,7024.784,"I really appreciate the Seattle education Association, among the many other unions representing workers in the public school district, who have taken such positions in the passed.",204,,
1196,0.97,7024.784,7042.702,"For example, the Seattle education Association having public actions and solidarity with the ongoing strike at that time of the Teamsters, 174, public school bus drivers.",204,,
1197,0.97,7042.702,7048.608,"Overall I appreciate the organizing of the Seattle public school Association have spoken up again and again in defense of their students, and fellow workers in public schools.",204,,
1198,0.97,7048.608,7051.277,Every day educators see the devastating impact of housing insecurity on young people.,204,,
1199,0.97,7051.277,7055.314,"They are organizing actually, S.E.A.",204,,
1200,0.97,7055.314,7078.104,"Organizing was crucial also for the fees my office developed in 2016 alongside the Washington community action network their support for today's legislation is also greatly appreciated and I wanted to especially thank the leadership of the Seattle education Association including Jennifer and UT, the President and the Vice President.",204,,
1201,0.97,7078.104,7088.681,All of whom who make time to meet with my office to discuss the legislation and also Rank- And-File Union activists from S.E.A.,204,,
1202,0.97,7088.681,7093.119,Like Bruce Jackson who brought the resolution to the S.E.A.,204,,
1203,0.97,7093.119,7095.154,Representative assembly supporting this legislation which passed overwhelmingly.,204,,
1204,0.97,7095.154,7101.661,And another one who presented to us as a member of the Renters' rights committee.,204,,
1205,0.97,7101.661,7129.989,I also wanted to thank nd the coalition that have advocated from city council.,204,,
1206,0.97,7129.989,7139.899,And most of all I want to thank the rank and file union members and socialists that have helped advocates for this bill.,204,,

1241,0.97,7264.457,7266.192,Chair Sawant and Council President Gonzelez.,227,,
1242,0.97,7266.192,7268.728,I am excited to bring this before my colleagues.,227,,
1243,0.97,7268.728,7275.301,I do want to begin by thanking the members of the state house stay healthy coalition.,227,,
1244,0.97,7275.301,7278.037,We have been working with them for seven months now.,227,,
1245,0.97,7278.037,7294.72,And I am really excited to be bringing this forward at their request and I want to thank representatives from the housing Justice Department.,227,,
1246,0.97,7294.72,7304.397,"Washington, Seattle, the Lgtb ship and tenants Union and real chair and share the cities and the landlords, solid ground and Lehigh and many others that are part of the work.",227,,
1247,0.97,7304.397,7314.34,I think its important that they are pushing us as a Council for more tenant protections and holding us accountable to our neighbors that rent in the city.,227,,
1248,0.97,7314.34,7319.178,So just a little bit of background.,227,,
1249,0.97,7319.178,7330.089,"According to the National equity list, county Renters owe an average of $4700 in back rent.",227,,
1250,0.97,7330.089,7336.062,"Combined approximately 39,000 Renters owe $186 million in pandemic related back rent.",227,,
1251,0.97,7336.062,7344.303,And we know over a third of black Latino communities are burdened with debt.,227,,
1252,0.97,7344.303,7349.208,These are neighbors whose work require that they are at increased risk to Covid.,227,,
1253,0.97,7349.208,7353.612,We also know that they are disproportionately uninsured.,227,,
1254,0.97,7353.612,7362.822,That something like medical emergency during a pandemic could significantly affect people's ability to pay for food and child care and other bills.,227,,
1255,0.97,7362.822,7376.235,These really are some of the essentially workers that we have been talking about and hearing about for the last year and the people without whom our city would have fallen apart last year.,227,,
1256,0.97,7376.235,7381.707,It is possible to do what we can to help protect them.,227,,
1257,0.97,7381.707,7390.249,We know that 58% of people facing a pandemic related financial hardship are low income themselves already.,227,,
1258,0.97,7390.249,7393.152,59% are people of color.,227,,
1259,0.97,7393.152,7396.455,And 71% lost employment related income in the last year.,227,,
1260,0.97,7396.455,7415.508,"So when you couple this with the fact that in just a few weeks the Eviction moratorium at this point will end, you can understand the urgency to provide a defense to Eviction for Renters that have fallen behind because of a financial hardship.",227,,
1261,0.97,7415.508,7422.515,The impending avalanche of Evictions is more than an issue of money but a systemic issue.,227,,
1262,0.97,7422.515,7426.085,Brought on by generations of these investments.,227,,
1263,0.97,7426.085,7426.385,All right?,227,,
1264,0.97,7426.385,7432.358,That is Seattle public schools calling.,227,,
1265,0.97,7432.358,7444.036,Brought on by generations of investments and we know that this Disin investment in communities of color and our racist housing policies have really continued to haunt us and that's part of the challenge here.,227,,
1266,0.97,7444.036,7449.742,We are trying to solve for some of these problems that are longstanding.,227,,
1267,0.97,7449.742,7452.978,So what will this bill do?,227,,
1268,0.97,7452.978,7457.283,This bill will allow tenants to assert a hardship defense at any time.,227,,
1269,0.97,7457.283,7464.256,If you are a Renter and will face financial hardship during the civil emergency you will be protected.,227,,
1270,0.97,7464.256,7481.04,If a landlord does serve an Eviction notice to tenants based on nonpayment of rent they must include a statement that Notifies tenants of their right to assert a defense based on nonpayment of rent caused by a financial hardship during the Covid emergency.,227,,
1271,0.97,7481.04,7488.581,Once in court tenants will have access to representation now that we have a right to counsel legislation that we passed earlier this year.,227,,
1272,0.97,7488.581,7497.356,"As part of that right to counsel process, tenants are asked to self certify that they are facing financial hardship.",227,,
1273,0.97,7497.356,7500.559,Following that Renters will be allowed to assert this defense.,227,,
1274,0.97,7500.559,7506.932,As I mentioned to Council this morning I thing this is important to reiterate.,227,,
1275,0.97,7506.932,7509.602,Landlords have resources available as well.,227,,
1276,0.97,7509.602,7522.948,King County executive recently announced that King counties will be offering this to $150 million in rental assistance to tenants and landlords.,227,,
1277,0.97,7522.948,7524.383,At the city we are offering $20 million in represent assistance.,227,,
1278,0.97,7524.383,7533.525,I think its important that landlords are aware of that and that they access those resources before considering Evicting someone.,227,,
1279,0.97,7533.525,7546.305,I will have some closing comments but I will leave it at that colleagues and happy to answer any questions that you have.,227,,
1280,0.97,7546.305,7547.64,All right.,228,,
1281,0.97,7547.64,7550.509,Thank you very much Councilmember Morales.,228,,
1282,0.97,7550.509,7553.212,Is there any additional comments?,228,,
1283,0.97,7553.212,7555.948,I see a couple of hands raised.,228,,
1284,0.97,7555.948,7562.721,Councilmember Sawant is next.,228,,
1285,0.97,7562.721,7565.024,And then Councilmember Pederson.,228,,
1286,0.97,7565.024,7565.357,Thank you.,229,,
1287,0.97,7565.357,7584.743,I am happy to support this Renter rights bills and happy to cosponsor it in the Renters rights committee as was stated it protects Renters from being evicted.,229,,
1288,0.97,7584.743,7597.723,Councilmember Mosqueda you are not muted.,230,,
1289,0.97,7597.723,7597.99,Sorry.,231,,
1290,0.97,7597.99,7602.761,It protects Renters from being behind in their represent in the Covid emergency.,232,,
1291,0.97,7602.761,7618.744,It is important and not the same as Covid debt and Renter and mortgage debt for working class homeowners is what we need to fight for because Renters would owe the back represent and hurt people's credit and sometimes people may face lawsuits.,232,,
1292,0.97,7618.744,7633.325,At the least it is important that city council pass this because lit mean that people won't be evicted and forced into homelessness for that back rent that was accumulated that Representers were forced to accumulate during Covid.,232,,
1293,0.97,7633.325,7672.498,So I hope our Councilmembers will vote yes and I want to know that this is both an economic justice and racial justice bill because of the end Dimmic racism understand communities of color are facing greater debt and so therefore are at a greater risk of Eviction once the moratorium end and we think it is important that city council pass this resolution urging the Mayor and the governor to extend the Eviction moratorium to make sure they do it.,232,,
1294,0.97,7672.498,7703.762,Last September apartment List.Com a Website for landlords and is followed by corporate landlords reported that 31% of Renters had unpaid rent and the share of white Renters is at 24% and black and Latino Renters are 48%.,232,,
1295,0.97,7703.762,7718.277,Even the corporate landlord Websites are acknowledging the disparities between white Renters and Renters of colors and Renters of colors are facing a dire situation and it is important that we pass this bill.,232,,
1296,0.97,7718.277,7721.246,Thank you so much Councilmember Sawant.,233,,
1297,0.97,7721.246,7728.654,Councilmember Pederson did you want to make comment?,233,,
1298,0.97,7728.654,7730.689,The floor is yours.,233,,
1299,0.97,7730.689,7732.458,I will put you in the Cue.,234,,
1300,0.97,7732.458,7738.664,Thank you Council President.,235,,
1301,0.97,7738.664,7760.219,To provide context for the Renters rights Committee for 120077 I had offered two amendments at Committee on May 26th it would have exempted small landlords and allowed this regulatory change for 18 months so that it Correspondences to the potential lingering effects of the Covid recession.,235,,
1302,0.97,7760.219,7774.967,We want to be mindful of the financial challenges faced by smaller housing providers that lack the economy of scale to avoid these costs and I don't think it is important to make such legislation permanent at this time.,235,,
1303,0.97,7774.967,7784.276,Neither of these passed so I voted no at committee and nothing has changed in material way since that time I will vote no today.,235,,
1304,0.97,7784.276,7792.751,While this legislation is framed as being related to Covid civil emergency it would be permanent.,235,,
1305,0.97,7792.751,7802.628,Rather than making wholesale permanent regulatory changes to existing relationships that put the entire burden on the housing provider regardless.,235,,
1306,0.97,7802.628,7811.403,"I bleak we could get more funds in the hands of tenants to make them whole, thank you.",235,,
1307,0.97,7811.403,7815.107,Thank you Councilmember Pederson.,236,,
1308,0.97,7815.107,7815.574,Councilmember Juarez.,236,,
1309,0.97,7815.574,7817.476,Thank you Council President.,237,,
1310,0.97,7817.476,7821.547,I'm just going to say some brief comments about all three bills.,237,,
1311,0.97,7821.547,7841.3,I reluctantly voted yes for the school year Evictions but not for some of the reasons that Council Pederson outlined but the main concern and I Volted yes is that ultimately we want to protect children and their family and educators but there is some issue on the definition and how broad that bill is.,237,,
1312,0.97,7841.3,7845.07,Nevertheless I voted yes because I don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water.,237,,
1313,0.97,7845.07,7851.51,However on this bill I cap vote yes on this one.,237,,
1314,0.97,7851.51,7855.013,I think that my main concern is the host here.,237,,
1315,0.97,7855.013,7865.324,I think we heard this from legal counsel as well and the preempt shun arguments.,237,,
1316,0.97,7865.324,7871.73,We need a comprehensive review of city tenant protections that work with state law.,237,,
1317,0.97,7871.73,7881.54,And I think this pandemic field has changed the landlord tenant and the landscape.,237,,
1318,0.97,7881.54,7894.453,I think this piece meal approach with long-term consequences will be difficult to Unwind.,237,,
1319,0.97,7894.453,7896.521,So regarding Council bill 120077.,237,,
1320,0.97,7896.521,7897.089,It is a defense.,237,,
1321,0.97,7897.089,7902.06,It means you have a defense going to court but doesn't mean it will be successful.,237,,
1322,0.97,7902.06,7904.663,I am always concerned about raising expectations.,237,,
1323,0.97,7904.663,7913.972,"So what you will have is somebody to come in to court's certain the defense of Covid, that's why you couldn't pay your rent during the moratorium.",237,,
1324,0.97,7913.972,7919.278,That doesn't mean that a judge or jury is going to buy that.,237,,
1325,0.97,7919.278,7923.849,And that doesn't mean you get to walk away from responsibilities.,237,,
1326,0.97,7923.849,7925.25,Of course these are not.,237,,
1327,0.97,7925.25,7929.955,I'm not passing judgment because all of us have been affected by this recession.,237,,
1328,0.97,7929.955,7937.162,And what it has done but obviously to Renters but a moratorium doesn't mean you don't have to pay.,237,,
1329,0.97,7937.162,7942.935,It means at some point you have to pay later or work something out with your landlord with in this.,237,,
1330,0.97,7942.935,7956.348,"And so with that, and what we have learned from legal counsel and the briefings that we have had and how it work with state law and the--I don't think it works with state law.",237,,
1331,0.97,7956.348,7958.216,That was made clear to us.,237,,
1332,0.97,7958.216,7963.889,But in any event I'm sorry but I can't support this today.,237,,
1333,0.97,7963.889,7964.99,Thank you.,237,,
1334,0.97,7964.99,7968.327,Thank you Councilmember Juarez for those comments.,238,,
1335,0.97,7968.327,7968.827,Really appreciate it.,238,,
1336,0.97,7968.827,7974.499,Are there any additional comments on the bill?,238,,
1337,0.97,7974.499,7974.7,Okay.,238,,
1338,0.97,7974.7,7990.048,I'm not seeing any other hands raised so Councilmember Morales you will get the last word as the prime sponsor and we will close that debate after your comments and call the bill to a vote.,238,,
1339,0.97,7990.048,7991.75,Thank you.,239,,
1340,0.97,7991.75,7997.422,"Colleagues, so I do want to acknowledge and thank Councilmember Sawant for sponsoring me.",239,,
1341,0.97,7997.422,7998.724,I neglected to mention that.,239,,
1342,0.97,7998.724,8017.275,Colleagues we know that thousands of our neighbors will find themselves caught with a growing mountain of debt and looming deadline for when that debt comes due and if we don't do something to provide a defense for Renters now we will face depression levels of homelessness.,239,,
1343,0.97,8017.275,8018.343,Our system is already overburdened.,239,,
1344,0.97,8018.343,8021.88,This is a huge issue that we have been talking about.,239,,
1345,0.97,8021.88,8032.057,And even if a quarter of the Renters who currently owe rent that fall in to homelessness our entire system can collapse.,239,,
1346,0.97,8032.057,8056.681,This is about providing some protection in the form of a defense so that there is at least an opportunity for them to have you know discussion to be able to work out the payments as Councilmembers have talked about and we have been discussing throughout this year as we talk about how to make sure that there are different levels and different mechanisms in place for folks.,239,,
1347,0.97,8056.681,8084.209,"So we have to respond to this impending crisis with the gravity that Itdy that deserves so that Renters that have faced a financial hardship don't face Eviction too and as Councilmember Juarez says we are not saying they don't owe it but when they are dealing with the hardship during this era and time that there is some protection from them, from getting evicted.",239,,
1348,0.97,8084.209,8087.412,This is the reason why they can't pay the rent for now.,239,,
1349,0.97,8087.412,8091.016,Passing this bill will do just that.,239,,
1350,0.97,8091.016,8095.187,And will help keep tens of thousands of Renters from the threat of Eviction.,239,,
1351,0.97,8095.187,8109.434,So I urge my colleagues to support the bill today and give them that protection and that defense.,239,,
1352,0.97,8109.434,8114.339,Thank you Councilmember Morales that concludes on 120077.,240,,
1353,0.97,8114.339,8122.314,I will ask that clerk call the roll.,240,,
1354,0.97,8122.314,8122.614,Juarez.,241,,
1355,0.97,8122.614,8127.085,No.,242,,
1356,0.97,8127.085,8128.854,Lewis.,243,,
1357,0.97,8128.854,8130.088,Yes.,244,,
1358,0.97,8130.088,8131.189,Morales.,245,,
1359,0.97,8131.189,8133.291,Yes.,246,,
1360,0.97,8133.291,8134.092,Mosqueda.,247,,
1361,0.97,8134.092,8134.392,Aye.,248,,
1362,0.97,8134.392,8136.461,Pederson.,249,,
1363,0.97,8136.461,8136.695,No.,250,,
1364,0.97,8136.695,8138.196,Sawant.,251,,
1365,0.97,8138.196,8138.597,Yes.,252,,
1366,0.97,8138.597,8139.531,Council President Gonzelez.,253,,
1367,0.97,8139.531,8139.764,Aye.,254,,
1368,0.97,8139.764,8140.565,Five in favor and two opposed.,255,,
1369,0.97,8140.565,8143.668,The bill passes and the chair will sign it.,256,,
1370,0.97,8143.668,8147.939,Will the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation on my behalf?,256,,
1371,0.97,8147.939,8156.681,Well will the clerk please read item five into the record.,256,,
1372,0.97,8156.681,8207.766,"Agenda item five Council bill 120090 new rental ten Nancys giving a tenant a right of first refusal after the expiration of ten Nancy for a specified time requiring a landlord declining to give tenant of first refusal and creating action and providing a defense to whiff a landlord refuses to give a tenant a right of first refusal and allowing agreement and amending 24.34 0-14.08.50 and 22.2061.0 of the Seattle municipal code and the city recommends it passes Wih Sawant, Morales in favor and Councilmember Pederson opposed.",257,,
1373,0.97,8207.766,8214.072,Thank you Madam clerk.,258,,
1374,0.97,8214.072,8223.181,"Councilmembers Sawant and Morales, is counsel member Morales going to speak.",258,,
1375,0.97,8223.181,8226.484,I am sure Councilmember Lewis will want to add point.,259,,
1376,0.97,8226.484,8228.186,Take it away.,260,,
1377,0.97,8228.186,8236.661,This bill as I said is jointly cosponsored by Councilmember Morales' office and my office and cosponsored by Councilmember Lewis.,261,,
1378,0.97,8236.661,8245.937,It creates a right of first refusal for Renters to renew the lease unless a landlord has a just cause for refusing to renew the lease.,261,,
1379,0.97,8245.937,8261.353,This issue has been discussed by the sustainable committee since March and I appreciate Councilmembers engaging on this issue and appreciate being able to work alongside Councilmember Morales on this bill.,261,,
1380,0.97,8261.353,8290.415,We heard from two panels of Renters and Renter right activists and discussed the legislation developed by our two offices and through those discussions and technical feedback becomes clear what Renters need is the right of first refusal and where there is a first chance to sign a new lease before offering it to any other Renters unless there is a just cause.,261,,
1381,0.97,8290.415,8295.92,Renters need a new lease long before there is any question of Eviction.,261,,
1382,0.97,8295.92,8308.566,I mean we have heard from hundreds of Renters that have been in this situation or about to be in this situation and strongly advocating for the passage of this bill to make sure that Seattle just cause protection covers all Renters.,261,,
1383,0.97,8308.566,8332.324,Few Renters that are told by the landlord that they will not have the lease renewed will refuse to leave because the law says they cab be evicted because in real life Representers will end up doing this and starting to look for a new place to live even though they know it is unjust and understandably they don't feel confident with having to potentially fight it out in court.,261,,
1384,0.97,8332.324,8364.122,"In the course of discussing the bill in the committee we heard from dozens of Renters that called in for public comments and several testified at the committee table who all recognize the legislation is basic common sense and I wanted to express my gratitude to all of the rank and file Renters, not only those that testified publicly but those that signed the petition and the community petition and release from my office and just hundreds of rank and file Renters that have spoken up.",261,,
1385,0.97,8364.122,8391.049,"But Star Billy is a Starbucks worker that testified at our committee that said ""as a Barista in the city I struggled for months to find an affordable apartment to rent, now the apartment that I moved in to has become less affordable each time I renew the lease because they raise it every year and I am afraid when the lease is up they will refuse to renew it and put it on the street.",261,,
1386,0.97,8391.049,8409.667,"""and one caller spoke in favor of the bill and said ""the first time that I was evicted it was after living in the House along with my roommates through two full six month leases without any problems and paying the rest on time.",261,,
1387,0.97,8409.667,8418.076,After the conclusion of the second lease however our landlord abruptly decided he would not renew the lease and we would all be having to move out.,261,,
1388,0.97,8418.076,8427.418,The second time I was evicted my landlord was converting our place into an Airbnb.,261,,
1389,0.97,8427.418,8440.565,And this puts the right of first refusal to the part of Seattle's law that is chapter 7.24 of the Seattle municipal code.,261,,
1390,0.97,8440.565,8458.216,If the landlord does not offer a new lease and have just cause 60 to 90 days before the lease and a date they can back up than Sddi has the power to investigate and either offer a new lease or present a just cause not to.,261,,
1391,0.97,8458.216,8477.435,As DCI can issue a citation or notice of violation and issue complaint if a landlord refuses to follow the law all this can happen before the lease end so I Deally the issues can be resolved and the Renter can get a new lease without anyone going to Eviction court.,261,,
1392,0.97,8477.435,8507.165,"Besides discussing with rest, we discussed with landlords and informed the Council this morning several small landlords support Renter rights legislation and some signed the petition and some landlords oppose this legislation and one of the landlords made an argument against this legislation where he said they are--that some Renters are quote, Unquote headaches and the lease, it is a convenient time to get rid of the headache Renters.",261,,
1393,0.97,8507.165,8522.347,The fact is over the last seven years my office has supported many Representers facing abuse from their landlords when I hear claims like Renters are headaches I asked what this means.,261,,
1394,0.97,8522.347,8526.084,This legislation allows landlords to refuse a new lease without a just case.,261,,
1395,0.97,8526.084,8531.155,It is a question of having--being Compliant with Seattle just cause.,261,,
1396,0.97,8531.155,8536.294,The list of just causes to refuse to renew the lease and not any headache.,261,,
1397,0.97,8536.294,8563.621,In other words if a Renter reports a landlord to the Seattle Department of inspections for housing court violations or violating the Representers' rights that might be a headache for the landlord but it is a completely legal and just for the Renter to seek Readdressal and not a just cause to kick out the Renter and not an example but a case we have seen happen many times.,261,,
1398,0.97,8563.621,8578.436,Just in closing and the initial remark of speaking closing again but last week Councilmember Morales distributed four technical amendments.,261,,
1399,0.97,8578.436,8593.952,Knop of them make any substantive change and after Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Lewis make introductory remarks we can move those technical amendments if Councilmember Morales wants to move the amendments.,261,,
1400,0.97,8593.952,8594.285,Thank you.,261,,
1401,0.97,8594.285,8599.057,Thanks so much Councilmember Sawant for the initial introduction that have bill.,262,,
1402,0.97,8599.057,8606.23,"Councilmember Morales or Lewis, do you have any additional comments you would like to make?",262,,
1403,0.97,8606.23,8606.698,Yes.,263,,
1404,0.97,8606.698,8607.265,Please.,264,,
1405,0.97,8607.265,8609.367,I will be brief.,265,,
1406,0.97,8609.367,8615.373,I do think Councilmember Sawant for providing a good overview of the technical aspects of how this will work.,265,,
1407,0.97,8615.373,8626.384,And I think you know for 40 years tenants have benefited from some kind of just cause protection in be the city which is--has been great.,265,,
1408,0.97,8626.384,8637.629,Those protections are no guarantee that their home will continue to be their home once they are current lease end and that is what we are trying to solve here.,265,,
1409,0.97,8637.629,8650.274,This bill brings the best elements of the two previous bills that Councilmember Sawant and I were working on and like the prior legislation proposes a simple fix.,265,,
1410,0.97,8650.274,8679.737,"That will ensure all tenants regardless of where they are or what kind of contract they have that they will be protected from a threat of no fault and no cause removal from their homes and provides tenants the first right of refusal to either stay in their home on a new lease or month-to-month lease or to voluntarily leave and also allows landlords to pursue removal if they have a just reason, cause reason for doing so.",265,,
1411,0.97,8679.737,8688.379,And Lastly it strengthens the tenants' bargaining power to rescind mutual lease negotiation where they were pressured into signing it.,265,,
1412,0.97,8688.379,8708.166,"This is another way to make sure that we are keeping folks, our neighbors that rent, keeping some protections for them and extending protections for them and ensuring that more Renters will benefit from tenant relocation assistance that is offered by the city.",265,,
1413,0.97,8708.166,8713.304,So you know as we start to move through recovery.,265,,
1414,0.97,8713.304,8727.885,As the emergency tenant problems are lifted it is important that our neighbors that rent continue to receive some stability and this is another way for us to make sure that happens.,265,,
1415,0.97,8727.885,8730.455,I do want to thank Devin Stillernil of my staff.,265,,
1416,0.97,8730.455,8732.523,He has been a trooper.,265,,
1417,0.97,8732.523,8763.988,"Really making sure that all of these different tenant protections and the work we are doing to protect the homeless neighbors all reflect what we are hearing from community and from our Houseless neighbors and from our Renters in communities so I really want to thank him for helping Shepherd, bringing their ideas into our Council office and before full council today.",265,,
1418,0.97,8763.988,8765.723,That is all I have.,265,,
1419,0.97,8765.723,8768.86,Thank you so much Councilmember Morales.,266,,

1421,0.97,8769.327,8770.161,Thank you Madam President.,267,,
1422,0.97,8770.161,8777.201,I will be brief on this and rest mostly on my excerpts that I made at committee.,267,,
1423,0.97,8777.201,8793.651,"You know I did have the opportunity then to address that several of the issues that have been raised by a lot of folks that have concerns over this bill are mostly addressed by the fact that with just cause, there can be notice provided.",267,,
1424,0.97,8793.651,8802.527,"So it is not a--you know, if you still do not want to for whatever reason renew a lease.",267,,
1425,0.97,8802.527,8823.181,This is a pretty reasonable change to make sure that spirit of our just cause Eviction protections are defending tenants when they are seeking a renewal to roll their ten Nancy that they depended on and the place where they found community and living as our neighbors to continue to do that.,267,,
1426,0.97,8823.181,8833.691,I think that we in a lot of ways tend to take for granted the investment that the tenants make.,267,,
1427,0.97,8833.691,8859.383,When they really put down roots and become part of the neighborhoods in our city and this is really making sure that we continue to hold tenants up as equal members of our neighborhoods and not somehow folks that are more Fungable and they don't deserve the community that folks that own homes can enjoy.,267,,
1428,0.97,8859.383,8865.59,This gets us one step closer and I am happy to support this and don't have anything else to add but the cosponsors did not add.,267,,
1429,0.97,8865.59,8871.596,In the interest of time I will leave it there.,267,,
1430,0.97,8871.596,8875.466,Thanks so much Councilmember Lewis.,268,,
