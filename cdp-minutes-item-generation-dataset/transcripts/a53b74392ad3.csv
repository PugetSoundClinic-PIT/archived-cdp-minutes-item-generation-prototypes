19,0.97,147.38,159.792,No objection today's agenda is adopted and we will go ahead and go through the Presidents report really quickly.,1,,
20,0.97,159.792,165.331,It's so good to see your faces and I'm really glad we were able to get the technology in place to be able to do Videoconferencing.,1,,
21,0.97,165.331,173.54,I think it makes it a little bit easier to do our business via Telecommuting and so I really appreciate all of the flexibility and willingness to participate in the Video option.,1,,
22,0.97,173.54,189.022,I'm sure many of us had to clean up the corners of our house to make it look presentable during this selfless isolation Quarantined period of time . I want to thank you all for participating.,1,,
23,0.97,189.022,203.203,Secondly I just want to flag that I sent out to the entire legislative Department in a memo updating the legislative Department Telecommuting policy and in that memo it States we will continue to Telecommute through April 24 which is a Friday.,1,,
24,0.97,203.203,213.012,Of course that they could either be extended and I suspect it will not be shortened but it certainly could be extended beyond April 24.,1,,
25,0.97,213.012,222.956,With our regional partners and their executives depart etc.,1,,
26,0.97,222.956,234.667,To set of reevaluate that date as time evolves and as more information comes around related to Covid-19 and how we are doing in terms of flattening the curve.,1,,
27,0.97,234.667,255.254,That includes a reminder resources available to lease throughout the legislative Department I know that right now can be a really stressful period of time for full who are having a hard time with isolation and quarantine and socially distancing in addition to physically distancing.,1,,
28,0.97,255.254,270.269,That are not resources available to our Goalies I just want to make the Council members are also reminding their staff that the resources are available.,1,,
29,0.97,270.269,289.489,Lastly are also want to include a memorandum that we received from the Seattle Department of human resources and the city of Seattle on the executive side has established a protocol and policy for daily self assessments of Covid-19 symptoms for all employees who are showing up and being physically present at City facilities.,1,,
30,0.97,289.489,293.626,Including City Hall.,1,,
31,0.97,293.626,296.429,And these recommendations were included as an attachment to the Email.,1,,
32,0.97,296.429,312.312,Their voluntary but they're strongly recommended guidelines that our employees and visitors are being asked to comply with to consist with Washington State Department of health recommendations.,1,,
33,0.97,312.312,322.055,"Secondly, I want to give folks a quick update on some of the work offices are doing related to house bill 6021.",1,,
34,0.97,322.055,341.641,This is passed on March 8 teens that will require the city of Seattle and other public employers to provide additional paid sick leave and expanded paid family medical leave to employees for qualifying Covid- 19 related reasons.,1,,
35,0.97,341.641,350.683,Where working to finalize the policy decisions and the administration of the new lead requirements by the deadline of the second of 2020.,1,,
36,0.97,350.683,401.534,Once we have a better sense of what the paid sick leave additional requirements would be for public employers like us and we will make sure to share those with the entire legislative Department and of course want to make sure that all of our staff and legislative staff including those staff members in our office that have the information they need and access tat they need for additional paid sick leave for Covid-19 related reasons we will keep you up dated on that and the third and last thing I will report on related to the Presidents report is related to the introduction and referral calendar and a proclamation we received from governor's office related to legislation that we can consider given the changes to the open public meeting act.,1,,
37,0.97,401.534,451.451,Just really quickly on the introductory referral calendar I want to encourage full on the call today to be mindful of the timing of when you are asking the Council and clerk's office to put items on the introduction referral calendar and last Friday we saw a flurry of four to five last-minute request coming in as 2:30 PM on Friday that creates a huge amount of burden for the clerk's office in terms of make sure that we are fulfilling our quality control processes and also making sure that we comply with the governor's new formation as currently interpreted.,1,,
38,0.97,451.451,475.007,For those that have not seen the proclamation by the governor's office there is some language in there that seems to play the only type of legislation that we are allowed to consider currently because we don't currently have public comment is legislation that is routine or related directly to the Covid-19 emergency response.,1,,
39,0.97,475.007,492.925,We are working with the law Department to get additional guidance and clarification from the Attorney General's office to make sure that we have a full and clear understanding of what the proclamation is.,1,,
40,0.97,492.925,505.938,Policy will make it very difficult for us as a city Council to do basic services and legislation required to deliver basic services if we are still severely limited in terms of what legislation we can consider.,1,,
41,0.97,505.938,535.568,Stay tuned for more information on that but we want to remind folks that it takes the clerk's office about 48 hours to review legislation and to make sure it's up to par with quality and to our professional standards because we just really want to make sure that you are robbing conscientious of those limitations and restrictions on our legislative staff.,1,,
42,0.97,535.568,553.653,I know that this is a unique circumstance and sometimes there can be exceptions to this rule but I would really like us to work hard to try to be Proactive and to have enough advanced notice as we are considering preferring to the introduction and referral calendar.,1,,
43,0.97,553.653,582.715,And the last thing I will say is that I'm really grateful to the governor's office for reaching out to my office and to the Councilmember office over in county to institute a weekly call to provide us with direct information and access to the governor's office to get updates about the state's emergency response and ways that we can collaborate.,1,,
44,0.97,582.715,596.128,I want to offer to all of you as my colleagues an opportunity to communicate directly with me and provide me with any sort of questions or concerns or issues that you want me to flag for the governor's office.,1,,
45,0.97,596.128,611.944,We usually meet at the end of the week on Thursday or Friday so just want to provide that opportunity for all of my colleagues so that we can coordinate that type of information.,1,,
46,0.97,611.944,616.315,That is all for the Council Presidents report and I'm happy to take any questions or hear any comments.,1,,
47,0.97,616.315,617.149,Okay.,2,,
48,0.97,617.149,623.522,"Hearing none, we will go ahead.",2,,
49,0.97,623.522,627.36,We will start the presentation.,2,,
50,0.97,627.36,629.362,I do have a comment.,3,,
51,0.97,629.362,631.03,Yes Council members Tammy Morales.,4,,
52,0.97,631.03,639.672,In the phone check I did I had emphasized that we do need to make every effort for public comment.,5,,
53,0.97,639.672,659.091,I stated this knowing that our staff has been doing an incredible job and I just want them to know that this is not something that is direct it at them but the Council is a body that we have to try to get public comment.,5,,
54,0.97,659.091,666.399,"Even if it is legislation related to Coronavirus, and especially so I think it's important to have public input.",5,,
55,0.97,666.399,691.123,And I want to register once again my sense of urgent the to address that issue and especially to that point that we have not extended this and it is possible it will be extended or it's likely that it will be cut short and it will be coming back and so I just want to register that.,5,,
56,0.97,691.123,706.005,Thanks Council members Tammy Morales and I know you and I had a good conversation last week about this issue . in our office we are still committed to see if we can find some sort of technological way to allow the public to comment.,6,,
57,0.97,706.005,716.182,So there are couple of layers and one is figuring out the interpretation of the governor's proclamation about what kind of legislation we can consider as a matter course during the emergency response.,6,,
58,0.97,716.182,724.123,"And then Secondly, figuring out how to Reintegrate public comment into that period.",6,,
59,0.97,724.123,746.178,It's unclear to me whether public comment via phone or Video will allow us to consider any legislation that is not emergency response related based on language we are reading in the proclamation.,6,,
60,0.97,746.178,751.117,But we are actively looking for other examples of how here locally and abroad that people are addressing the comment issues.,6,,
61,0.97,751.117,772.204,I know the board of Seattle has figured out or their test ways to make sure that they can hear from the public and we are looking at those examples and hoping to be able to come up with some sort of resolution so that we can integrate public comment,6,,
62,0.97,772.204,778.31,Any other questions or comments from folks?,7,,
63,0.97,778.31,781.981,We heard from the Council President.,8,,
64,0.97,781.981,798.03,Hello and I just want to let you know I will be on Audio at about 10:20 am and if I don't get a chance to do my presentation before going to Audio than perhaps the Councilmember as my vice chair could read the report if possible.,8,,
65,0.97,798.03,798.831,That's fine.,9,,
66,0.97,798.831,806.939,I know several folks have to leave the call early.,9,,
67,0.97,806.939,830.896,I know the office of Intergovernmental affairs reached out to all of us last night with an offer to tour the new U.S. Army field possible at Centurylink and really grateful for the opportunity for us as elected officials to build it to her that facility and I know some of you have to get off the call to take advantage of that important opportunity to look at that public health facility at Centurylink.,9,,
68,0.97,830.896,836.535,So I appreciate the heads up.,9,,
69,0.97,836.535,843.142,So let's move into the third agenda item which is the presentation of the condition of the West Seattle bridge.,10,,
70,0.97,843.142,854.286,I believe we have our Presenters Online which include Sam Zimbabwe as the director of Seattle D.O.T.,10,,
71,0.97,854.286,858.591,And Lorelei Williams and Matthew Donahue and Adiam Emery all with the Seattle Department of transportation.,10,,
72,0.97,858.591,861.827,So at this point I will handed over and have the Department give us a presentation.,10,,
73,0.97,861.827,871.237,Unless Councilmember Alex Pedersen or Lisa Herbold do you have any introductory comments want to make before the presentation starts?,10,,
74,0.97,871.237,875.941,If I could I just have a couple of introductory remarks and I will make it quick.,11,,
75,0.97,875.941,876.575,Go ahead please.,12,,
76,0.97,876.575,884.583,I want to think thank Sdot for their quick agreement to participate in this briefing.,13,,
77,0.97,884.583,890.889,"As you can imagine, constituents and District one were really shocked at the short notice of the closure.",13,,
78,0.97,890.889,921.053,There's universal support for the fastest action possible for West Seattle and this is the second emergency layered upon the Covid-19 emergency . for me the key questions are how long is the upper bridge going to be usable and what can the Council do to assess the quickest action possible.,13,,
79,0.97,921.053,922.755,Whether or not that is funding or permanent assistance.,13,,
80,0.97,922.755,928.193,We need to know how long it will take to complete the repairs and if we don't know now than when will be have an estimate.,13,,
81,0.97,928.193,931.463,And also getting a sense for how much work that Sdot is doing right now.,13,,
82,0.97,931.463,951.183,And I also want to thank Sdot for their quick response to the many requests for traffic mitigation and traffic management mitigation measures and the work that they are already doing to put in the temporary Stoplight at Highland park and Holden.,13,,
83,0.97,951.183,960.092,Because some of the cars are getting off of the first Avenue bridge and coming up the hill.,13,,
84,0.97,960.092,961.56,That's all I have for right now.,13,,
85,0.97,961.56,962.594,Thanks Councilmember Jay Inslee.,14,,
86,0.97,962.594,972.504,Councilmember Alex Pedersen as chair of the transportation committee are there any remarks you like to make before we get,14,,
87,0.97,972.504,993.025,I agree with what Lisa Herbold is saying and I'm very concerned about the West Seattle bridge and we are going to be putting on today's Council agenda actually with a resolution adding the West Seattle bridge to our capital Watchlist because it has now become an urgent capital project and we want to make sure it is done thoroughly and quickly.,15,,
88,0.97,993.025,999.098,And will be setting up additional briefings to keep the public informed about what is going on.,15,,
89,0.97,999.098,1008.841,Not only with the West Seattle bridge but also with key bridges throughout her city as it RAISES questions about the inspections and process for bridges throughout her city and thank you.,15,,
90,0.97,1008.841,1012.177,Thank you Councilmember Alex Pedersen.,16,,
91,0.97,1012.177,1020.452,We will now handed over to go ahead and get the presentation started.,16,,
92,0.97,1020.452,1024.256,For those of you who are Videoconferencing and there is a little button that you can mute yourself on.,16,,
93,0.97,1024.256,1034.666,So if you're not actively speaking ask that you mute yourself so that we don't hear any Ambient noise to interrupt the presentation and thank,16,,
94,0.97,1034.666,1044.143,All right and thank you for this opportunity.,17,,
95,0.97,1044.143,1059.258,Another system challenging time for all of us in terms of having it transparent and open dialogue about this issue so I think you for giving us the opportunity to have this platform to do so.,17,,
96,0.97,1059.258,1069.802,We are all in separate locations right now as well and so we will be managing on our side as well as we can across this time to be able to present to you all of this information.,17,,
97,0.97,1069.802,1090.322,I would also suggest because another will be a lot of questions and we have a lot of information that we will try to present as quickly as possible and if folks can use the chat function then we will be able to Proactively answer those questions and be prepared to do so as quickly as possible as I know some folks have to get off the call as well.,17,,
98,0.97,1090.322,1094.927,We recognize this has come at a real shock and a time when there are a lot of stressors in everybody's lives.,17,,
99,0.97,1094.927,1108.207,Have a lot of people who are doing the extraordinary on a daily basis . and this is adding to the challenges that they face in terms of getting around for those essential rings that they need to get around.,17,,
100,0.97,1108.207,1118.884,We empathize with those residents and with you the Council we want to emphasize that this was not an easy decision or decision that we take lightly.,17,,
101,0.97,1118.884,1134.766,Will continue to communicate regularly with accuracy and transparency and be flexible as conditions change on the ground and as we have no information to share.,17,,
102,0.97,1134.766,1148.347,Since last Monday we have been providing almost daily updates to the public and the media and we stood up a Website with Www.Seattle.Gov and we mobilized our community engagement team to listen and respond to questions from the public.,17,,
103,0.97,1148.347,1160.392,"From our work in West Seattle as of late, our ability to engage this community is well in place.",17,,
104,0.97,1160.392,1165.063,"Above all else, I want to convey that the Seattle Department of transportation does not take tenses when it comes to public safety.",17,,
105,0.97,1165.063,1173.572,That's why we close the West Seattle bridge and the high- rise bridge on March 23 last Monday to all traffic.,17,,
106,0.97,1173.572,1177.009,We hope today's discussion makes three things clear.,17,,
107,0.97,1177.009,1190.422,"First safety is our top priority full stop . Second, the rapid announcement to close the bridge came as a result of ongoing and close monitoring of the conditions of the bridge.",17,,
108,0.97,1190.422,1200.999,We really regularly Inspector bridges and we expect the West Seattle high bridge at least every year if not every two years.,17,,
109,0.97,1200.999,1212.611,The life of the bridge was in the for the construction of the bridge to last 75 years.,17,,
110,0.97,1212.611,1218.383,During the added inspections over the last several years there was no indication of the course of that time that the bridge was unsafe for ordinary use.,17,,
111,0.97,1218.383,1223.755,And that remediation would affect the normal use of that.,17,,
112,0.97,1223.755,1234.533,The Preventative maintenance we had done over the past few years did not indicate that there will be any change to the normal use of the bridge.,17,,
113,0.97,1234.533,1251.783,We will talk a little bit more about what has changed and evolved over the last few months and even few weeks to lead us to this decision that came on all of us very quickly despite the diligence that we have shown in inspecting and maintaining this bridge.,17,,
114,0.97,1251.783,1275.173,"Third, this issue is absolutely top of mind and for me a key priority of Sdot and for all of us for this to work and will will talk more about what we have done already in the past week to put in place the project team to be able to accomplish all of what we are talking about very quickly.",18,,
115,0.97,1275.173,1293.025,So we are sharing the presentation and we will go through an overview very quickly and we want to emphasize that all of our infrastructure ages.,18,,
116,0.97,1293.025,1304.403,Usually does so in a predictable fashion that enables us to prepare for major maintenance or replacement instead of project teams and communication and outreach to the public.,18,,
117,0.97,1304.403,1305.57,And there are very few surprises.,18,,
118,0.97,1305.57,1307.239,We have had some.,18,,
119,0.97,1307.239,1316.815,We had a Lane closed on the fourth Avenue bridge late last year and Washington D.O.T.,18,,
120,0.97,1316.815,1324.122,Had to do emergency repairs on the Aurora bridge that changed traffic patterns very quickly.,18,,
121,0.97,1324.122,1330.629,"When these infrastructure changes happen and when conditions warrant, we take swift and decisive action to maintain public safety.",18,,
122,0.97,1330.629,1343.375,"We know that often come as a shock and when those things become apparent and when we have to take that action, we have to do so with the care.",18,,
123,0.97,1343.375,1346.712,We like to do these things in a very planned and deliberate fashion.,18,,
124,0.97,1346.712,1380.979,The Viaduct closure last year is a good example it's also a similar level of traffic impact and a similar level of vehicles that are using that struck every day we did briefing after briefing with over 40 joint community briefings and press events and other communications around the Viaduct closure that it was because it was happening in a more predictable way and there were many years of discussing what to do about the Viaduct as a whole.,18,,
125,0.97,1380.979,1391.49,"For reasons that we don't yet know about what is happening with the West Seattle bridge, we were given hours to do what we previously had months or even years to do in the case of the Viaduct.",18,,
126,0.97,1391.49,1406.404,We recognize that this has been a huge level of in packed at a time when people have all sorts of other things that are concerning for them in their lives.,18,,
127,0.97,1406.404,1416.314,We needed to take this action swiftly and decisively to maintain public safety and maintain the asset of the bridge and minimize the need for repairs overall.,18,,
128,0.97,1416.314,1421.019,And with that we can go to the next slide and this is just a brief overview and will keep an eye on time.,18,,
129,0.97,1421.019,1430.328,But we will go through some of the inspection and maintenance history with our decision to close our short term recommendations and what we're doing right now.,18,,
130,0.97,1430.328,1447.245,What we had done where we are going from the traffic impact and where we are going from the repair option and how we are organizing ourselves and where we see the next steps and will try to do that as quickly as possible to be able to answer questions.,18,,
131,0.97,1447.245,1455.287,I know the chat function may not be effect in terms of maintaining the public dialogue so feel free to interrupt this if you need to ask questions as we go.,18,,
132,0.97,1455.287,1458.59,Director Sam Zimbabwe.,19,,
133,0.97,1458.59,1468.5,We have been told that we should not the chat function at all because we need to make sure that we are maintaining an appropriate public wreck of questions being asked.,19,,
134,0.97,1468.5,1495.927,"I would ask the Council members that if you do want to ask the question, either jump on in or use the chat function to tell me that you have a question so that I can interrupt the presentation and allow questions to be asked and so we are all learning how to do this Videoconference the same together for the first time.",19,,
135,0.97,1495.927,1498.997,And hopefully we can make it productive and still be orderly.,19,,
136,0.97,1498.997,1506.938,Just a reminder to not use the chat to ask questions.,19,,
137,0.97,1506.938,1520.352,But if you have a question I have the chat feature open on my computer.,19,,
138,0.97,1520.352,1528.527,As they will talk about the traffic management impacts and then the repair options and then I will close out from the communication.,19,,
139,0.97,1528.527,1533.131,"Matt, take it away.",19,,
140,0.97,1533.131,1535.033,A bit of background on this bridge.,20,,
141,0.97,1535.033,1547.145,It was built and open for use in July 1984.,20,,
142,0.97,1547.145,1557.689,Along with the lower left-hand corner after one of the most hit by a freighter in 1978.,20,,
143,0.97,1557.689,1561.159,The operate hand section of the photo is a construction photo from when they were building the High-Rise.,20,,
144,0.97,1561.159,1568.266,You can see these two cast in place SEC Segmented boxes.,20,,
145,0.97,1568.266,1571.503,The reinforced concrete bridge.,20,,
146,0.97,1571.503,1577.809,Comprised of two very large boxes with a monolithic slab that ties across the top of the beads.,20,,
147,0.97,1577.809,1585.784,A few things to note as we get into the deterioration in our inspection program.,20,,
148,0.97,1585.784,1588.987,And how and why that had concerned us versus normal wear and tear for the bridge.,20,,
149,0.97,1588.987,1594.092,Reinforced concrete bridges are to some extent made to crack.,20,,
150,0.97,1594.092,1603.401,We anticipate that concrete will crack overtime and we have performed design calculations for the ridge to accommodate that.,20,,
151,0.97,1603.401,1622.253,No one and in particular me as the bridge manager for the city as a special engineer and a certified ridge Inspector ecstasy any kind of atypical deterioration's we're typically very careful to find any deterioration to make sure it's not normal deterioration in the structure you expect versus something different.,20,,
152,0.97,1622.253,1630.261,A couple things to note about the ridge because it is very unique in terms of the span length and overall height.,20,,
153,0.97,1630.261,1642.24,It is essentially for topography and geography to get up into West Seattle and up on the hill for the junction.,20,,
154,0.97,1642.24,1648.68,It was originally designed for three lanes of traffic in either direction.,20,,
155,0.97,1648.68,1651.149,And that has four lanes of traffic in the Eastbound direction.,20,,
156,0.97,1651.149,1655.987,And in the Westbound direction.,20,,
157,0.97,1655.987,1665.196,Next slide please.,20,,
158,0.97,1665.196,1673.104,Along with what the inspection program has look like over the last few years and every bridge on the national highway system monitored by the state D.O.T.,20,,
159,0.97,1673.104,1681.813,And down to the city facet owners like us it's required to be expect did inspected above water every month for two years.,20,,
160,0.97,1681.813,1719.15,We had a routine inspection for the bridge along with what you would normally expect for this bridge type and it triggered right away a close eye and that we hired a consulting engineering firm here in Seattle to work with us in 2014 to study the bridge to see if we could determine at that point what is causing this atypical cracking it was not conclusive and they pointed out a number of things that could causing it with this recommended action that was to continue to inspect a more regular frequency at least every year or every two years.,20,,
161,0.97,1719.15,1731.763,And also to monitor the bridge into that senior we had installed cracked cages with a consulting firm that does that sort of work linking back to the Website to monitor that data real-time.,20,,
162,0.97,1731.763,1736.267,And so that instruments instrumentation was put for the,20,,
163,0.97,1736.267,1754.486,& GT; may I ask you to pause and Council members Lisa Herbold has indicated she has a question . the floor is yours but you are on mute still.,21,,
164,0.97,1754.486,1758.523,Actually I would like to hold my question until after we go through the rest of the slide.,22,,
165,0.97,1758.523,1763.261,I'm sorry for alerting you and I do have a question but after we get to the rest of the slide.,22,,
166,0.97,1763.261,1764.095,Okay.,23,,
167,0.97,1764.095,1768.7,And once you are done speaking about this slide can you pause to allow Council members Lisa Herbold to ask her question?,23,,
168,0.97,1768.7,1786.618,Mckissick and picks from 2014 to 2019 we continue to perform our annual inspections and look at stage data we were getting on a regular basis.,23,,
169,0.97,1786.618,1816.314,We saw the cracking continuing to grow but not at an alarming or accelerated rate and you can see from the package with data that the the stands and the cracks are active and expand and contract overtime an average growth over time was very small down to 1000Th of an inch of glass son 2019 what had changed was that we also do something required by the Federal Government in addition to inspections called load rating of bridges.,23,,
170,0.97,1816.314,1869.3,This is a specific calculation method to look at whether or not the bridge can handle very specific types of trucks and the trucks are specified in terms of access and wait by the Federal Government and whenever they come out with a new truck that accident to the program than the Federal Government comes up with a mandate that says everyone with this type of bridge or any type of ridge within a certain distance of the Federal highway system any have to load the bridges and trucks so they rolled out new trucks and they gave us until 2022 to do that load rating and have scheduled the bridge for load rating later than 2019 and in 2019 because we still have this cracking issue so we decided to move the load rating up to 2019 because we knew the way you could get those calculations for load rating is very specific to the types of defects that we observed.,23,,
171,0.97,1869.3,1878.409,If you see atypical defects you are required to do a more advanced analysis and we know would be more time to pump it up in the schedule.,23,,
172,0.97,1878.409,1912.81,So we have these two parallel lines with this advanced analysis and load rating in 2019 and we continue to inspect the bridge just as we need to from an inspection program standpoint and we're trying to gather the data to feed into the analysis so that we can really find these cracked sections and understand how to accurately analyze them ultimately what we did was we built a large model and a localized lawn Nonlinear model to really dive deep into these cracked sections so that could do responsible load management.,23,,
173,0.97,1912.81,1918.249,As we are gathering data for the analysis we see the cracking patterns of the bridge that start to change and accelerate.,23,,
174,0.97,1918.249,1930.061,And so by late February we adopted the point where consultant part of the is working with this recommended going down to two lanes in either direction.,23,,
175,0.97,1930.061,1937.568,As we were preparing to do that in planning how to execute that traffic control standpoint and now preparing to alert the Mayor's office and city Council and everyone else that needs to know about this.,23,,
176,0.97,1937.568,1947.345,The day we were having a briefing of the day before I got a call from a consultant partner to change the restriction done to two lanes to closure.,23,,
177,0.97,1947.345,1955.687,That was on March 19. so I had a briefing with Sam and other leadership at D.O.T.,23,,
178,0.97,1955.687,1968.8,On the 20th and we discussed the Lane closures and the recommendation and then I spent Friday and the weekend going through and consuming all of that information and digesting it.,23,,
179,0.97,1968.8,1973.971,And then we made the call to bring my engineering team and the consultant partner onto the bridge at 9 am on Monday morning.,23,,
180,0.97,1973.971,1979.41,So that brings me to the next light but the decision to close.,23,,
181,0.97,1979.41,1981.012,Hold on.,24,,
182,0.97,1981.012,1982.48,Lisa Herbold has a question.,24,,
183,0.97,1982.48,1987.518,Yes please.,25,,
184,0.97,1987.518,1993.758,I really appreciate it and I just want to raise the issue of notice to the public and transparency.,25,,
185,0.97,1993.758,2023.454,Is really being critical and I am of the opinion that when we moved to monthly inspections that the public and the Council should have been notified in a useful way and one way to do that I believe is through our capital projects report that comes to the Council.,25,,
186,0.97,2023.454,2036.067,There is actually a program related I believe to the work that you have been doing and there's a bridge load rating and the CIP project.,25,,
187,0.97,2036.067,2047.678,That would have been really useful in the third quarter report last year.,25,,
188,0.97,2047.678,2067.165,We had been notified because again the notification process through those quarterly reports and through the project review is intended to notify the Council of the increased risk around particular programs and projects.,25,,
189,0.97,2067.165,2076.774,As it relates specifically to the bridge rating it's not a specific project but it is a program and it's a program that you are doing for number of pages.,25,,
190,0.97,2076.774,2079.31,But bridges.,25,,
191,0.97,2079.31,2092.39,But at the point that you decided that you needed to expedite the bridge load rating for the West Seattle bridge and you have moved to monthly inspections.,25,,
192,0.97,2092.39,2108.005,"I think that would have been really useful thing and as I mentioned earlier, there's really a universal response of shock and some cases anger from constituents in West Seattle about this.",25,,
193,0.97,2108.005,2128.86,"In keeping with our commitment to transparency and no surprises and preparation, I would really appreciate the Department to think about how to adjust its reporting so that we can move towards a culture of no surprises.",25,,
194,0.97,2128.86,2132.363,Thank you,25,,
195,0.97,2132.363,2155.786,Thanks and I will just jump into respond and I think we all hear that and understand it and going back to what we said at the very beginning that it was not until very recently that we thought any of the repair needed for the bridge would change any normal daily traffic patterns on the bridge in terms of what it would take for repair.,26,,
196,0.97,2155.786,2176.607,We all hear the concern and we are happy to figure out ways to make sure we are communicating Transparently and if we had started that reporting last all then we would not have said we think we need to close the bridge because it was not something we were planning for,26,,
197,0.97,2176.607,2183.981,Thanks and so on the slide with his October and November and December to begin analyzing options and closing the bridge was not of the options you are considering at,27,,
198,0.97,2183.981,2187.118,Is that accurate?,28,,
199,0.97,2187.118,2190.188,That's right.,29,,
200,0.97,2190.188,2198.629,That is as how we would mitigate the cracking and not what Medications need to be done.,29,,
201,0.97,2198.629,2202.433,Just to follow up on that line of questioning.,30,,
202,0.97,2202.433,2226.824,If we're looking at this slide to slide forward then at what point in time is the closure to traffic considered as a potential option that would be required to address the cracking.,30,,
203,0.97,2226.824,2239.237,The first time we receive an indication from a consultant partner that they would recommend going in each direction is February 21.,31,,
204,0.97,2239.237,2243.474,February 21 was the reduction under consideration that shows up here.,32,,
205,0.97,2243.474,2247.478,We did not receive notice until last week?,32,,
206,0.97,2247.478,2254.251,That's right.,33,,
207,0.97,2254.251,2257.488,When we got the initial it was not the immediate that this needs to happen tomorrow.,33,,
208,0.97,2257.488,2259.357,The Lane restriction.,33,,
209,0.97,2259.357,2273.17,We started to put together what it would take from a traffic mitigation and what it would start to look like from a traffic management plan perspective.,33,,
210,0.97,2273.17,2287.318,Indication at that point is this is something we had to seriously consider but then we did not have to do that immediately.,33,,
211,0.97,2287.318,2313.744,This was at the same time as everybody knows it was the same time as the Department and city respondent to Covid-19 and putting a lot of different practices in place and things like that that are also consuming attention and they did not stop the inspection procedures but they did make it more difficult to have some of the preparatory discussions even for what Lane restrictions will look like.,33,,
212,0.97,2313.744,2343.808,We totally understand the frustration and concern about this and we will seek that from here forward on this project and on all projects we seek to have that dialogue as early as we think possible to not undoing the alarming the public but also to make sure we are accurate and transparent in our communications with you and the public as a whole.,33,,
213,0.97,2343.808,2356.487,I think to the point of Council members Lisa Herbold that it was about three to four weeks before the city council found out that the lean production in this case was a full closure was going to occur.,34,,
214,0.97,2356.487,2367.998,And we found out just a few hours before the general public found out and our constituents learned that they would no longer have access to the West Seattle bridge.,34,,
215,0.97,2367.998,2383.814,I think over a period of three or four weeks that could have been more product engagement certainly at a minimum as the chair of the transportation and utilities committee and the District representative for district 1. I'm disappointed that that Proactive engagement did not occur.,34,,
216,0.97,2383.814,2407.405,And that it took sort of this severe action for the Department to acknowledge moving forward that he needs to engage city Councilmembers on issues of such significant import.,34,,
217,0.97,2407.405,2433.564,So I understand and I appreciate that we are all under pressure but we still have the obligation to communicate with each other and the obligation is escalating and even more serious and even a harder to do which means we have to be much more Proactive to figure out how to engage with each other and all of the Councilmembers here and they take it very serious to be accountable to our constituents and to communicate Transparently.,34,,
218,0.97,2433.564,2440.738,And so I think the Department could have done a better job in engaging the Councilmembers as it relates to this particular issue.,34,,
219,0.97,2440.738,2451.282,I appreciate the three hours Mac heads up because I did not find out about it for the first time in the media.,34,,
220,0.97,2451.282,2460.791,But I also think we can do better and I know that we can do better in terms of how we can came just,34,,
221,0.97,2460.791,2469.4,"I don't want to Belabor this point but we are committed to that same level of transparency and the recommendation for closure did not come to us until Friday, March 19.",35,,
222,0.97,2469.4,2498.796,"It was not until matt himself went up on the bridge on Monday morning March 23 or Thursday, March 19 and then went up on the bridge on Monday, March 23 in the morning and confirmed what the recommendation was and saw the growth that will go to the next slide and then from that point once we have that level of recommendations and we cannot take the time to brief everybody and make sure we have all of the plans in place.",35,,
223,0.97,2498.796,2521.752,We have to take swift and decisive action and so I fully appreciate his frustration we could have had more discussion in the weeks leading up to it and we will seek to do that from here on forward and also at that point there was not an indication that we had to take such sweet swift action to maintain the public health safety.,35,,
224,0.97,2521.752,2532.53,I don't want to get too bogged down with this but I do think we have a shared commitment to openness and transparency and shared commitment to informing and being open and transparent going forward.,35,,
225,0.97,2532.53,2535.599,Great and let's move along.,36,,
226,0.97,2535.599,2542.673,Okay thank you.,37,,
227,0.97,2542.673,2547.378,Can we go to the next slide.,37,,
228,0.97,2547.378,2573.17,"We saw a rapid and unexpected growth in the bridge in the days and weeks because public safety is the number one priority and is the certified bridge Inspector with over 25 years of experience and if you look at the blue lines in the photo, that is growth that occurred between 5 March which is the earliest time in March in the bridge and the 23rd when we went out to see the bridge.",37,,
229,0.97,2573.17,2587.318,That type of growth in the reinforced concrete structure is completely unacceptable and that is typically the type of growth you see over years but not over weeks and days.,37,,
230,0.97,2587.318,2590.421,That drove me primarily as a bridge Inspector and bridge manager to the city to.,37,,
231,0.97,2590.421,2602.433,Up the phone from inside the bridge and call Lorelei Williams and my deputy director to say we needed to close the bridge that day . and then with that live load or vehicular live load from the bridge.,37,,
232,0.97,2602.433,2608.706,With the risk of public safety.,37,,
233,0.97,2608.706,2619.249,And then towards the end of it.,37,,
234,0.97,2624.221,2640.371,Angular cracks like that are diagonal and that type of deterioration in the bridge will go until failure and and failure typically happens quickly without warning as opposed other kind of cracking it is not oriented that way.,37,,
235,0.97,2640.371,2647.277,That exacerbates that concern.,37,,
236,0.97,2647.277,2655.853,It could happen very quickly without the bridge changing shape before it actually gets that way in addition to the rate of the cracking.,37,,
237,0.97,2655.853,2660.09,We can go on to the next slide.,37,,
238,0.97,2660.09,2671.702,Short-term recommendations from the high pass,37,,
239,0.97,2689.586,2726.857,We will be inspecting these cracks and what the bridge can handle as they continue to be true with a suite of instrumentation and techniques and how the mechanics of the crack sections actually work to help thinking about design and repairs even before we start the design process.,38,,
240,0.97,2726.99,2737.301,Along with this issue.,38,,
241,0.97,2755.419,2779.309,The graphic you showed seem pretty quick and the rate of the cracks expanding and then if this is sudden disaster happening.,39,,
242,0.97,2779.309,2790.621,Then if they allow that lower bridge and a chance that the upper bridge may collapse at any moment.,39,,
243,0.97,2790.621,2810.007,I don't think there's a risk the bridge can collapse at any moment.,40,,
244,0.97,2810.007,2814.244,Will continue to monitor the bridge in April.,40,,
245,0.97,2814.244,2829.426,They very Astutely pointed out in the briefing last Monday the same point and we get to the bridge to failure and to come up with the emergency response plans.,40,,
246,0.97,2829.426,2854.618,Along with that fashion to mitigate Risch for any infrastructure or people that the currently work around the bridge at the South in of harbor Island.,40,,
247,0.97,2861.458,2868.899,Along with this mode modification on that.,40,,
248,0.97,2868.899,2872.369,Along with the engineer with Lane reductions.,40,,
249,0.97,2872.369,2906.637,Along with the immediate notification with the rapid discussion and how to communicate that because Lane closures that sound very serious to be taken seriously and communicated with that level of seriousness to our constituents Úif we need to close lanes with several bridges throughout the city.,40,,
250,0.97,2911.008,2913.944,And the floor is yours.,40,,
251,0.97,2913.944,2938.168,The bullet point Referencing the goal of interim repairs with the goal of restoring some traffic then we understand there may be a possibility of adding Elaine back at some back like so many general reopening's.,41,,
252,0.97,2938.168,2951.148,And won't be able to determine that until we get into the weeds but we will take the lines to see what they could return and such fashion.,41,,
253,0.97,2951.148,2958.288,And related to the following bullet point for major maintenance and repair.,42,,
254,0.97,2958.288,2969.967,Can you talk a little bit more as we mentioned.,42,,
255,0.97,2977.641,2989.72,The classic message for delivery the structure is through the entire design putting it up for bids to build it.,43,,
256,0.97,2989.72,3008.638,And that other ways to do it we have the designer of record and the contractor with repairs working Hand-In-Hand earlier in the process to cut down on difficulties and construction that are not really realized in the design process.,43,,
257,0.97,3008.638,3020.05,Understood the process but I was asking if there were other strategies beyond that process.,44,,
258,0.97,3020.05,3041.972,And I may be wrong on that this requires an extraordinary Out- Of-The-Box thinking to move the work forward as quickly as possible.,44,,
259,0.97,3041.972,3052.949,And to combine that with gathering stress and strain data and how the bridge currently carries their own weight as a way to get ahead of design.,44,,
260,0.97,3052.949,3067.564,Typically that's not something we would start to get inside of the official design process and we're doing that now.,44,,
261,0.97,3067.564,3114.244,"Like I would like to throw out that given the fact that we have 17,000 folks who travel the bridge with another 100,000 vehicles that we should look to see whether or not there are still additional strategies that we can consider as you mentioned earlier it is truly an emergency for the West Seattle commuters and I would just like to see whether or not extraordinary approaches that could be used to address these extraordinary circumstances.",44,,
262,0.97,3114.244,3127.457,We are looking for any possible way to return the bridge to normal operations as quickly as possible and restore any amount of traffic as quickly Aspossible.,45,,
263,0.97,3127.457,3137.767,And we would not go out of step in terms of making decisions to put us in a difficult position to do so safely and successfully.,45,,
264,0.97,3137.767,3154.684,Rear right there with you in terms of getting things done as quickly as possible and looking for all of the possible ways to accelerate this process and will be happy to have that conversation as we go forward.,45,,
265,0.97,3154.684,3166.863,And will make it clear that our decisions that end up putting ourselves and financial risk that would be successfully able to make those repairs to be expedient over being prudent.,45,,
266,0.97,3166.863,3175.005,That was not my suggestion but I appreciate you clarifying that.,46,,
267,0.97,3175.005,3188.985,I'm speaking to treating this like an emergency as well as it relates to the contracting processes that were discussed before.,46,,
268,0.97,3188.985,3201.831,And we appreciate obviously that we need to move forward that are founded by concerns around public safety and thank you.,46,,
269,0.97,3201.831,3202.632,Absolutely and we share,47,,
270,0.97,3202.632,3204.935,Let's go ahead and move along.,48,,
271,0.97,3204.935,3207.437,Next slide please.,49,,
272,0.97,3207.437,3239.369,Now to the previous comment because we're still looking at the swing bridge very carefully that we had been addressing over the past months in the normal course of asset for the bridge but it is laser focused is the primary bypass route as emergency responders and transit.,50,,
273,0.97,3239.369,3265.195,The things we're doing right now and we will continue to do and the weekly inspections and monitoring of particular areas of the bridge as they continue to be more heavily loaded with traffic Coincidentally several weeks or months ago we have a load rating project for the bridge and will bring that to a close and we have problem with these dates that need to move and lock in a particular sequence and and opening cycle.,50,,
274,0.97,3265.195,3276.172,And so those things have a particularly long lead time as we order them toward the end of last year and we recently received those and we have a maintenance installation plan coming up for in a couple of weeks I April.,50,,
275,0.97,3276.172,3290.587,We also have an ongoing project for the control system to replace the bridge and as some of you may remember in 2018 we had an outage of the peer six on the Western side.,50,,
276,0.97,3290.587,3308.238,The peer in this photo with the lift cylinder that went out on us we had to put out and put it in her spare cylinder and we are bringing our forensic analysis and rehabilitation program for that cylinder is there currently in service for the seven Servitor this cylinder this year.,50,,
277,0.97,3308.238,3313.443,And with that he will turn it over to Audio memory for the,51,,
278,0.97,3313.443,3325.588,Thanks and in regards to traffic and the level of complexity of closing the West Seattle bridge is very similar to the Viaduct if not more complicated.,52,,
279,0.97,3325.588,3338.335,"Those two Infrastructures cover the same amount of average daily traffic divided into 100,000 with West Seattle with 84,000.",52,,
280,0.97,3338.335,3358.254,With the Viaduct we have had ample time to develop strategies to partner with her agencies to have enhanced our transit and so forth and to inform the public and participating in minimizing their trip.,52,,
281,0.97,3358.254,3369.399,So with West Seattle we did not have that luxury but we had stated that prior they implement the emergency closure a week ago.,52,,
282,0.97,3369.399,3371.0,And we could go within five hours Mike.,52,,
283,0.97,3371.0,3379.008,One of the things we understand that West Seattle has very limited crossing point of the waterway.,52,,
284,0.97,3379.008,3385.615,The first Avenue South bridge and the infrastructure that can address or handle a lot of the Reroutes.,52,,
285,0.97,3385.615,3398.695,"And in the North end of West Seattle we have very limited capacity with 20,000 maximum capacity that can handle.",52,,
286,0.97,3398.695,3404.534,"Which actually translates to stop and go traffic if we allowed 20,000 to utilize the bridge.",52,,
287,0.97,3404.534,3421.017,Hence we have limited the usage of lower Spokane bridge for emergency responders and transit and freight to make sure that we are not Impeding emergency vehicles Respons rate and so forth to these residents.,52,,
288,0.97,3421.017,3433.963,We are redirecting currently everyone to South park and we are also being aware and cautious about where we are redirecting this to make sure we have upper medication.,52,,
289,0.97,3433.963,3439.269,So that we have expedited this to be built at the parkway.,52,,
290,0.97,3439.269,3457.587,And I'm happy to announce that it is operational and it was turned on yesterday so it is operating right now and we are making sure that we are adding more traffic stations to make sure that we are Data-Driven as we assess our mitigation approach moving forward.,52,,
291,0.97,3457.587,3473.203,Not coordinating our South Park residence and making sure neighborhood Street such as South park are not inundated with traffic impact we will continue to mitigate and Strategize how we manage the traffic.,52,,
292,0.97,3473.203,3474.27,Next slide please.,52,,
293,0.97,3474.27,3481.077,Before you move on Council member Jay Inslee has indicated she has a question.,53,,
294,0.97,3481.077,3482.178,Thank you so much.,54,,
295,0.97,3482.178,3502.432,I just want to repeat earlier thanks for your quick action to install the signal and as it relates specifically to monitoring the traffic count.,54,,
296,0.97,3502.432,3514.01,Thank you for adding the traffic count stations and I'm interested to know how frequently that you will have reports on those traffic counts.,54,,
297,0.97,3514.01,3526.256,And what your plan is to share that information particularly with myself and the transportation chair Alex Pedersen.,54,,
298,0.97,3526.256,3537.367,And just because I am really interested to know as new traffic patterns develop and how quickly you may be able to consider adjusting access.,54,,
299,0.97,3537.367,3560.189,You have made a commitment that you are making those decisions on a Database approach and I just want to understand a little bit more with some additional Granularity how frequently you will be monitoring those traffic patterns and in particular I want to put another Plug-In.,54,,
300,0.97,3560.189,3577.206,I am hearing a lot from our Healthcare workers that are nurses and firefighters and police officers and Emts and they are working a lot of overtime.,54,,
301,0.97,3577.206,3588.117,They are not taking public transit so that they can be more likely to stay healthy as they are driving to their jobs.,54,,
302,0.97,3588.117,3609.505,I am really hoping that of course founded by the principles of public safety that there is an approach of traffic mitigation approach that allows the consideration of the expansion of the lower-level bridge for some of those workers.,54,,
303,0.97,3609.505,3609.906,Okay.,55,,
304,0.97,3609.906,3611.14,And I'll be happy to take.,55,,
305,0.97,3611.14,3619.048,So where we have currently the traffic count at the lower Spokane bridge which we can report in a daily basis.,55,,
306,0.97,3619.048,3634.664,"The first influx we saw after the closure on a Tuesday we saw 15,000 crossing in lower Spokane which had really stressed the emergency responders and we heard a lot my partner agency for the responders to say that this is not reliable.",55,,
307,0.97,3634.664,3653.182,Want to make sure that the restriction of lower Spokane continues and as you stated we will be Data-Driven and if there are opportunities in which to open it up maybe in the late evening and so forth if there is capacity we could continuously consider those things.,55,,
308,0.97,3653.182,3670.566,The new added data points once we have them in place would be very happy to report out daily or weekly in terms of the analysis and from an engineering perspective we're utilizing the data for the signal timing to adjust other things continuously on a daily basis.,55,,
309,0.97,3670.566,3697.393,"With that being said, I want to stress the level of the lower Spokane bridge because clearly it is the closest in terms of the waterway crossing but keeping it available and reliable for emergency responders especially in the time that we are in is very essential and I just want to make sure that we place these restrictions for the time which we have restricted it for now.",55,,
310,0.97,3697.393,3716.112,We keeping our vulnerable use of pedestrians in mind along with the bikes and transit in mind as we hope to mitigate and with all of the routes where we are directing other traffic to go through.,55,,
311,0.97,3716.112,3721.651,So it is a continuous monitoring and adjustment.,55,,
312,0.97,3721.651,3730.359,I want to jump in and say that right now we are in an extraordinary traffic period.,56,,
313,0.97,3730.359,3740.069,We have seen massive declines in following the home stay at home order people are following that and are not traveling in the way that they normally would.,56,,
314,0.97,3740.069,3762.892,"And so right now we know that her traffic levels are different even in the first couple of days of the closure despite putting in restrictions on the lower bridge and we saw 13,000 people a day or 15,000 people per day using that bridge.",56,,
315,0.97,3762.892,3805.735,If and when things come back to normal let's say and I'm up domestic will be back to normal hopefully soon from a traffic perspective but we need to be very careful about not taxing and over stressing her infrastructure knowing that there are these impact so we are very committed to sharing and figuring out the best ways during the Viaduct closure with the--board and communicating with an automated basis basically what traffic impacts were and we are very committed to doing the same things and Unfortunately this will not be a short-term issue that we have to deal with but we will figure out ways to share information and adapt as we go forward.,56,,
316,0.97,3805.735,3808.538,That's right.,57,,
317,0.97,3808.538,3817.113,Next slide please.,57,,
318,0.97,3817.113,3831.327,The Detour map indicates how we are advancing everyone that had to the first Avenue here and then limiting the lower Spokane bridge.,57,,
319,0.97,3831.327,3847.777,I want to acknowledge people that live in the North end of West Seattle and we're asking them to travel and adding five more miles to their driving time to get back into 99 and we recognize that that could be a challenge for some.,57,,
320,0.97,3847.777,3864.393,I think as some have stated that when we go back to normal that this has a special request in which a number of trips need to be reduced in order to mitigate impact we are seeing.,57,,
321,0.97,3864.393,3884.413,"And we are not seeing that many impacts but it is just that level of traffic that we are moving the West Seattle bridge on a daily basis with 84,000 and so that will require a lot of strategies and so forth to reduce the number personal trips that we are making moving forward.",57,,
322,0.97,3884.413,3888.417,Next slide please.,57,,
323,0.97,3888.417,3914.41,This is reiterating what Sam had indicated because we are planning what the strategies will be as we get back into normal traffic patterns and we have a task force set for the Metro report to Strategize how we will handle this impact that has been introduced to our network.,58,,
324,0.97,3914.41,3923.052,And it's exactly the same level of effort that we had seen in the Viaduct and that is that level that we anticipate to implement forward.,58,,
325,0.97,3923.052,3934.096,Now I will pass it on to Matthew Donahue.,59,,
326,0.97,3934.096,3938.167,Okay so what will we do to get the bridge back in service?,60,,
327,0.97,3938.167,3948.978,First we need to put in temporary shoring to preserve the structure and that is primarily to make it safe for contractor to be on the bridge and to do more explicit extensive repairs.,60,,
328,0.97,3948.978,3992.188,The approach to the repairs at this point we think it will likely be carbon fiber wrapping with additional reinforcement to keep connections as the carbon fiber wrapping is a woven carbon fiber mesh and he can lay it onto the bridge and anchor it down to code it with the type of epoxy as it Hardens up to four Michelle that Additionally reinforces and provides integrity as a bridge and we will likely combine it with a steel strand in the concrete that was tightened up as part of the original construction and locked down and we could still use that technique to put additional postage inside the hollow part or on the outside if necessary depending on how the mechanics of the cracked sections ultimately work out.,60,,
329,0.97,3992.188,4011.24,And we mentioned before we will be looking at alternate delivery methods and we need to be really careful in the design to see if we can do it in such a way that it does not impact the box and the theoretical box around the Federal no navigation channel any the bridge.,60,,
330,0.97,4011.24,4031.827,If you cross into the plane of the horizontal limits of that navigation channel or if you change the clearance of the bridge and it triggers Federal permit through the Coast Guard that could add significant time to capacity because he cannot stay outside of that box.,60,,
331,0.97,4031.827,4034.263,And so I think with the next slide as we talk about,60,,
332,0.97,4034.263,4034.864,Sure.,61,,
333,0.97,4034.864,4037.266,Just trying to wrap up here as well.,61,,
334,0.97,4037.266,4045.775,Thanks everybody for their time on this.,61,,
335,0.97,4045.775,4051.113,So we have already talked about our commitment to openness and transparency and we stood up a Website and we are continuing to share this information.,61,,
336,0.97,4051.113,4073.602,We have an ongoing partnership with the Department of neighborhoods to connect with community and open the feet back channels so that we can problem solve in real time with people and then make sure that we keep everybody up-to-date as new information is available and as we have a regular rhythm of information to share and as we come upon major milestones.,61,,
337,0.97,4073.602,4076.405,I hear that the council member has a question.,61,,
338,0.97,4076.405,4090.719,Councilmember Lisa Herbold you are on mute and then after this we have a question as well.,62,,
339,0.97,4090.719,4091.32,Thank you.,63,,
340,0.97,4091.32,4098.828,"As it relates to communication, I think part of communication also Includesmaking sure that the public understands what the enforcement practices are.",63,,
341,0.97,4098.828,4126.655,If you could just speak to how we are planning to enforce the restriction of the lower-level bridge to the freight transit and first responders and other populations of drivers as those restrictions are considered for relaxation.,63,,
342,0.97,4126.655,4143.672,Sure and so right now we have signs out indicating who is permitted to travel and we have support from the police Department and trying to make sure that people follow those.,64,,
343,0.97,4143.672,4152.281,We are trying to figure out what the best practice and how to best do that.,64,,
344,0.97,4152.281,4160.99,And Unfortunately we have seen a lot of people violating those restrictions which has led to challenges in managing the traffic flow.,64,,
345,0.97,4160.99,4184.78,Our general approach to enforcement of all of our traffic rules is to have people follow the rules as we set the amount and to have a slight of an enforcement touch as possible and if we cannot get results that we need through that then we will have to reevaluate the strategies.,64,,
346,0.97,4184.78,4195.157,But I think ultimately that if we have everybody trying to use the lower bridge then nobody will be able to use the lower,64,,
347,0.97,4195.157,4200.629,"That's right and as you note, I think a lot of folks are continuing to use the lower-level bridge.",65,,
348,0.97,4200.629,4213.442,This is an area that I would like to have some continuing conversation . with you about.,65,,
349,0.97,4213.442,4235.931,Obviously I am speaking on one hand to the interest of using the lower-level bridge for more commuters as is safe in the future and I also have real concerns about the extent to which it is being used now in conflict with the current restrictions.,65,,
350,0.97,4235.931,4242.071,Absolutely and I think that's a place where we know that not everybody reads are logged or gets our Twitter stream.,66,,
351,0.97,4242.071,4262.291,I think some people are used to doing things the way they are used to doing them I want to make sure people are getting some information about these restrictions so that they know how to plan their trips and it will be something we will all need to work together as a community to make sure we use that ridge to the best extent possible.,66,,
352,0.97,4262.291,4269.665,Thank you.,67,,
353,0.97,4269.665,4271.5,Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda is on the line.,68,,
354,0.97,4271.5,4298.494,Thank you Council president and thanks to Sam Zimbabwe with two brief points and one is that we just went to Centurylink field for the tour and I will want your team to assess the current situation this morning but I want to echo the concerns about first responders been stuck in traffic right now and people clearly using that as a shortcut . I hope that some of them are medical providers.,69,,
355,0.97,4298.494,4335.364,It does appear that there are number of people who are not first responders and not in that commercial transit that are clogging up the lower bridge and I just want to flag that for you and I echo the Council members point that if the desire to make sure that that is a viable traffic Pathway not just for Healthcare providers but also those where human service providers and providing assistance to our homeless population and permanent supportive housing and so I just want to flag that.,69,,
356,0.97,4335.364,4338.167,And my question for you was on a second to last slide.,69,,
357,0.97,4338.167,4354.149,You mention the way in which we are going to try to adhere to a quick response in the long-term is ones and with her quick response can you speak to the safety of the workers and the precautions we will put into place so that we can make sure the bridge is a safety hazard.,69,,
358,0.97,4354.149,4357.82,So how will we keep our workers protected from Covid-19 exposure?,69,,
359,0.97,4357.82,4361.09,Sure.,70,,
360,0.97,4361.09,4394.79,"So we have already implemented social distancing guidelines for all of our staff and we are working with all of our construction sites to implement updated safety plans that take into count health best practices as it rotates relates to Covid-19 exposure and as matt said, some of the way that the bridge is built with the hollow nature of the bridge is a pretty tight and close space.",70,,
361,0.97,4394.79,4411.64,And so as we look to even installing and ensuring then we need to make sure we have the ability to keep their workforce safe that is doing that essential work to get the bridge reopened.,70,,
362,0.97,4411.64,4416.311,None of this was made easier by the public health emergency in which we find ourselves.,70,,
363,0.97,4416.311,4425.053,And so we need to keep all of those issues front and center as we are working on some of these critical infrastructure projects.,70,,
364,0.97,4425.053,4457.586,Thanks Council president and I just appreciate all of the work that we have already chatted about in terms of truly essential construction work and I will continue to raise questions about these other projects in our region that have a deadline of 2023 and I think it remains what is the additional two to four weeks and I think this is in a different category with the safety of our community at stake.,71,,
365,0.97,4457.586,4468.497,Thank you for your ongoing work now and in the future to make sure we are addressing what is essential to let them stay home and this is a great example and we appreciate the protection of,71,,
366,0.97,4468.497,4474.57,Council President.,72,,
367,0.97,4474.57,4480.642,Councilmember Dan Strauss you have the floor.,73,,
368,0.97,4480.642,4514.209,I'm also just about to enter Centurylink field with the event center with Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda and I want to echo all of her thoughts which I think were spot on as well as echoing Councilmember Alex Pedersen with the appreciation for the fast movement of Sdot to take safety measures as a priority as well as more information earlier that is appreciated and we want to highlight thanks to Sdot and your team for moving quickly.,74,,
369,0.97,4514.209,4570.299,Thank you Councilmember Dan Strauss . and so we know that we have gone quite long but I also really just want to on the slide which is about communications plan I really want to put in a plug for utilizing our local media to get out as much information as possible to people in West Seattle and to do that through the lens of not just English but also for limited English proficiency or non-English proficient populations of which there are many in West Seattle as it relates to detours and staying off of the lower bridge unless you fall into the appropriate population.,75,,
370,0.97,4570.299,4573.502,And also as it relates to traffic impacts and mitigation.,75,,
371,0.97,4573.502,4596.625,District 1 is incredibly diverse as it relates to language and economic position and I just want to make sure that we are looking at this through the lens of Leveraging local media that is really critically important to get out that information and I know that South Park has strong channels of communication with community members and South park.,75,,
372,0.97,4596.625,4618.647,And they follow the West Seattle Blog with a little dog with her friends over and the Blog to make sure that Sdot is working very closely with throughout district 1 that folks will understand what's at stake here.,75,,
373,0.97,4618.647,4643.171,And particularly as it relates to why it is important to not just shortcuts through the lower bridge . and people just really need to understand what the update if they are not following those restrictions as outlined by the city.,75,,
374,0.97,4643.171,4667.796,With all of those points that's also where our Department of neighborhoods helps us to make sure we are communicating out broadly and excessively with the West Seattle log I think we all know it's just critical for anything happening in West Seattle and Tracy was the first interview with the media on this and we will look to continuing that Channel.,76,,
375,0.97,4667.796,4670.599,I just completely agree that it's essential that we get information about this.,76,,
376,0.97,4670.599,4679.775,Both the repair and ongoing mitigation and detours and stuff like that as badly as possible so that we can be successful.,76,,
377,0.97,4679.775,4682.911,Our last slide and I know we had a lot of dialogue along the way.,76,,
378,0.97,4682.911,4700.162,It also really just about how we are structuring ourselves very quickly to tackle this and this is not something that falls within one work group but it is with all of us very quickly.,76,,
379,0.97,4700.162,4719.548,Oacs no and heather marks who was instrumental in our success around the Viaduct closure last year and bringing public information and putting together all of the things that needed to have been from the Sdot Perspectie and I asked her to take the lead on coordinating all of the.,76,,
380,0.97,4719.548,4724.553,Back that needs to happen with the West Seattle bridge.,76,,
381,0.97,4724.553,4742.938,We have heard from matt and how he is leading on the structural aspects and the traffic management aspect along with Dan Anderson who has been Úleading a lot of our communication on the Multimodal corridor and the rapid investments.,76,,
382,0.97,4742.938,4761.056,So there are a lot of ties a knowledge with community living on a public information and as a deputy chief of staff and the agency liaison working with other agencies and bring other people together very quickly.,76,,
383,0.97,4761.056,4769.798,"For all of you on the Council, our Council liaison is invaluable resource for Channeling requests as she is tied in with the team as well.",76,,
384,0.97,4769.798,4798.193,"And then, this is really just a critical and with all know this is a critical piece of work which is where we had rapidly stood up this team within the context of our public health response right now and the Covid-19 response tied into all of the emergency response we are doing there and then this will live on as a structure guiding us through this whole process.",76,,
385,0.97,4798.193,4812.908,I want to reinforce again that we are taking this incredibly seriously and working to organize ourselves to be successful in delivering restoring the bridge.,76,,
386,0.97,4812.908,4821.55,Thanks so much to all of the staff at Sdot for joining us in short order to do this presentation.,77,,
387,0.97,4821.55,4834.162,Before we conclude I know that we have another question about the next steps.,77,,
388,0.97,4834.162,4836.431,And so I will go ahead and handed over to her.,77,,
389,0.97,4836.431,4842.27,And she may actually be gearing up to ask the question that I was thinking about.,77,,
390,0.97,4842.27,4846.575,So I'm not going to ask my question until I hear what Council member Lisa Herbold has to say.,77,,
391,0.97,4846.575,4847.742,Please and the floor is yours.,77,,
392,0.97,4847.742,4854.749,Thanks Council President.,78,,
393,0.97,4854.749,4875.57,So as it relates specifically to our next steps and to both the near-term and the long-term repairs it would be really helpful to know how it is that you intend to fund the Short- term repairs as soon as possible.,78,,
394,0.97,4875.57,4903.231,And what can Sdot do to address or identify which projects that they can no longer afford to do that we can make these funds available and whether or not the Council action is needed and I'm assuming it would to authorize shifting some resources and when will we have more of a picture on that,78,,
395,0.97,4903.231,4905.533,Those are all good questions.,79,,
396,0.97,4905.533,4907.135,And yes.,79,,
397,0.97,4907.135,4922.15,There will be budget impacts on the whole of the Sdot program in terms of taking these steps and these will be discussions we will need to have.,79,,
398,0.97,4922.15,4932.727,Quite likely we need to get a little bit of a better handle on what exactly the repair and the shoring and repair options are.,79,,
399,0.97,4932.727,4955.684,We expect that will happen over the next few weeks and can have some more of that discussion and this is the same time as we all know and recognize along with our CBO director that has been very clear about some of the challenges we are facing as a city in the economic response to Covid-19 as well.,79,,
400,0.97,4955.684,4961.756,I think there's a lot that will be coming around the budget and how this fits into all of that.,79,,
401,0.97,4961.756,4964.592,And it will be a dialogue that we will need to have.,79,,
402,0.97,4964.592,4975.97,I don't have the exact timing but I recognize it will be key and something we will engage on.,79,,
403,0.97,4975.97,5012.34,Lastly I also want to mention that last year and beyond where we are right now in terms of shoring and repair then we also recognize there is a need to start talking about what the long-term is beyond even repair and how it is similar to what E have been doing on the ball or bridge recently and other bridges were we have a little bit more leadtime in these types of discussions to have this in-depth and robust discussion of what the options are beyond the immediate Near- term situations that we find ourselves in right now.,79,,
404,0.97,5012.34,5019.547,That is not our immediate priority right now but it is something we need to start doing as soon as we possibly can.,79,,
405,0.97,5019.547,5051.479,Now in terms of the next steps here and I am still missing in terms of this piece of information and would appreciate and knowing what the Department is thinking about this and these Timelines around some of the short-term solutions that you identified and of course the long-term solutions.,80,,
406,0.97,5051.479,5060.655,Can you give us a sense for when this Timeline of implementation and processing related to those two different step's of solutions identified in the previous slide.,80,,
407,0.97,5060.655,5080.008,This is obviously taking us a little bit accelerating faster than we thought it would and not as much information as we would like to have an in terms of some of those things.,81,,
408,0.97,5080.008,5091.519,And some of that will go Hand- In-Hand with what the budgetary impact may be for the short or the long-term and the Midterm repair options.,81,,
409,0.97,5091.519,5109.904,And Unfortunately it will not be a short duration and I don't want to give the impression that this is something we will handle within the next few weeks or something like that.,81,,
410,0.97,5109.904,5115.543,We are working to do it as quickly as possible and to do all the things we need to do.,81,,
411,0.97,5115.543,5134.662,And that is something that may Outlast the public health emergency that we found ourselves in right now which is why we need to be thinking about what the Medications are as things get back to a state of normalcy as well.,81,,
412,0.97,5134.662,5147.842,You and your staff cannot give the city council any sort of stress of a Timeline as it relates to the short term goals and the long-term goals of repair.,82,,
413,0.97,5147.842,5159.187,A week after this we made this decision to close the branch and very reluctant to speculate with what the Timelines are.,83,,
414,0.97,5159.187,5173.868,And at this point with anything they give the they would likely have problems and I'm very reluctant to even try to speculate on it.,83,,
415,0.97,5173.868,5179.107,And it would put out a false sense with a better understanding of the path forward than what we currently do.,83,,
416,0.97,5179.107,5201.496,I can appreciate that and we certainly don't want to create Timelines for ourselves that will not be realistic and set of false expectation for people who rely on the West Seattle bridge for moving about and whether it is people on buses are people in cars.,84,,
417,0.97,5201.496,5236.364,But I do think it's important for the city Council to get a sense for what the process will be that the Department will undertake to be able to get to appoint where it has a high level of confidence in establishing the Timeline and whether that is by phases or for that complete project and right now we're standing up for only about a week after the decision was made and it was made public that there will be full closure of the West Seattle bridge.,84,,
418,0.97,5236.364,5247.575,I do think it is incumbent upon us to get a better understanding from you all with Sdot what the process will look like for determining the relevant Timelines and what they might be.,84,,
419,0.97,5247.575,5249.844,Is that something the Department can do?,84,,
420,0.97,5249.844,5253.281,Yes we can do that.,85,,
421,0.97,5253.281,5264.492,I think it will be over the next month or so that we will have a better sense of where and what we need to do.,85,,
422,0.97,5264.492,5268.129,And we can start to put some of those actions in place at the same time.,85,,
423,0.97,5268.129,5276.671,I am very committed to sharing that with the council as we have more information about it.,85,,
424,0.97,5276.671,5283.845,And I do think that the next three or four weeks are what we will need to be able to come back with a better information and answer all of those questions.,85,,
425,0.97,5283.845,5297.692,I appreciate that . that gives me a better sense of how long the process will take to reevaluate Timelines and I think that is helpful.,86,,
426,0.97,5297.692,5304.832,What I'm hearing from use in the next three to four weeks you will have a sense for what the potential Timelines might look like.,86,,
427,0.97,5304.832,5319.914,What I would ask of you now is for a commitment to work with Councilmember Lisa Herbold and Council member Alex Pedersen in my office to make sure that we are in tight communication around with that process is.,86,,
428,0.97,5319.914,5332.66,And what potential Timelines might look like as it relates to both the short-term strategies and the long-term strategies of repair of the West Seattle bridge.,86,,
429,0.97,5332.66,5334.162,Is that something you all could do?,86,,
430,0.97,5334.162,5337.365,Definitely .'s Mike great.,87,,
431,0.97,5337.365,5340.234,I don't have any other questions at this time.,87,,
432,0.97,5340.234,5350.978,Other any of my other colleagues with questions before I close out the presentation?,87,,
433,0.97,5350.978,5353.848,I'm not hearing from anyone.,87,,
434,0.97,5353.848,5363.791,I just want to really quickly think Sdot for all of the quick work that you all did.,87,,
435,0.97,5363.791,5369.764,I think that I was here had expressed some frustration at the top of the presentation as it relates to the timing of the planned notification given to us.,87,,
436,0.97,5369.764,5387.715,But I don't want that expression of frustration to minimize the hard work that I know that Sdot is doing and I especially want to thank matt for this quick work and recognizing that this was a serious public safety issue for the people of Seattle.,87,,
437,0.97,5387.715,5427.155,And I can only imagine sort of how significant it was for Matthew Donahue to undertake that decision and to see what you saw in that moment with your own eyes and to build to make that call and do it quickly for the best interest of all users of the West Seattle bridge and I really just want to thank you for making that tough call and for doing the work necessary to make sure that we as a city acted quickly to preserve life and safety.,87,,
438,0.97,5427.155,5431.626,I know that this is an inconvenience for many folks in West Seattle or people coming in and out of West Seattle.,87,,
439,0.97,5431.626,5461.289,At the end of the day we have a paramount duty to preserve life and safety of those people who use or may use the West Seattle bridge and Emily proud of the work that Sdot did to step into action to do that . So we have to give just a little bit more amidst this crisis to drive those additional five miles to get to where we need to get during this creative time to be on.,87,,
440,0.97,5461.289,5473.1,So thanks to all of you for your work in that and Matthew Donahue especially for all of the work you are doing on this as well.,87,,
441,0.97,5473.1,5475.102,You're welcome all right.,88,,
442,0.97,5475.102,5480.808,We will go ahead and conclude this portion of our agenda and we could say goodbye to our Sdot folks and thanks so much for being with us.,88,,
443,0.97,5480.808,5485.68,We really appreciate you and we will go through ahead and move through our agenda.,88,,
444,0.97,5485.68,5501.929,We are running a little long today as we are slated to be here until at least 1130 so hopefully we can get the reports of today's city council actions done and about 30 minutes.,88,,
445,0.97,5501.929,5506.767,Collects we will go ahead and become the next discussion on the preview of today's city council actions and counsel and regional committees.,88,,
446,0.97,5506.767,5513.841,Once again I'll call Anna Council members by district numbers starting with district one and ending with the citywide positions of eight and nine.,88,,
447,0.97,5513.841,5517.745,Let's go ahead and start with district one.,88,,
448,0.97,5517.745,5532.527,Councilmember I think that you are giving the report for Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda as well?,88,,
449,0.97,5532.527,5537.465,I believe that I am but if I could do that at the end so I can shift my piece of paper and,89,,
450,0.97,5537.465,5539.267,District 1 Councilmember take it away.,90,,
451,0.97,5539.267,5539.934,Thanks so much.,91,,
452,0.97,5539.934,5543.771,Have a couple of items on the agenda today.,91,,
453,0.97,5543.771,5550.444,The first is the resolution 31939.,91,,
454,0.97,5550.444,5556.551,This is a resolution in support of the bid by the city of Seattle to host the National League of cities in 2025.,91,,
455,0.97,5556.551,5568.596,This is a little surreal to talk about inviting convention to the city of Seattle in the midst of these circumstances that we are living in.,91,,
456,0.97,5568.596,5577.071,This is in 2025 and it Re-Ups a previous resolution that the Council had passed.,91,,
457,0.97,5577.071,5597.425,This is a little bit of background with the country's oldest and largest and most representative organization serving municipal governments with the mission to strength and and promote cities and centers of opportunity and leadership and Governance.,91,,
458,0.97,5597.425,5601.028,The city of Seattle is a longtime member and they had previously hosted this conference in 2013.,91,,
459,0.97,5601.028,5608.302,Visit Seattle is preparing Seattle's bid and working in partnership with the Association of Washington cities.,91,,
460,0.97,5608.302,5623.15,The Mayor has already signed a letter indicating the support for hosting the 20/25 conference and my office has previously circulated information about the conference and its expected impact on Seattle.,91,,
461,0.97,5623.15,5640.134,Including answers to the checklist of questions required by the resolution for special events that may have impacts on the city and impact and otherwise and this is a piece of legislation that the Council had passed a couple of years ago.,91,,
462,0.97,5640.134,5664.458,Today's resolution declares the city councils of court of Seattle's bid and invite the Nlc to conduct a site visit as it considers whether it will host it is projected to be about 4500 attendees with an estimated economic impact of about $13.8 million for the city of Seattle.,91,,
463,0.97,5664.458,5680.307,Just as far as a little bit of further background in 2018 as mentioned earlier the Councilmember had sponsored and passed another resolution to support the hosting of the conference in 2024 or 2025.,91,,
464,0.97,5680.307,5713.34,Visit Seattle believes a new resolution specifically with the target date that will be required to ensure a more competitive bid for them and given that desire I had initiated the review process outlined in the resolution to ensure that the city council is providing appropriate oversight and central staff reviewed the visit Seattle request and has indicated that conference meets the definition of a major event.,91,,
465,0.97,5713.34,5725.152,Special permitting is unlikely to be required and this event is unlikely to result in the triggering of the future obligation per the Reveille resolution to determine the city's financial exposure and resource commitment to the event.,91,,
466,0.97,5725.152,5773.2,The threshold to trigger the obligation that was not met is anticipated overtime Expenditres with 3% of his Seattle lease Department budget overtime other items on the agenda today is we also have a resolution 31942 and this relates to the near-term spending and the mitigation costs for the repair and mitigation during closer for the West Seattle bridge and it basically adds the bridge to quarterly reporting requirements.,91,,
467,0.97,5773.2,5779.607,Councilmember Alex Pedersen may have more to add about this but this adds this project to our quarterly watch program.,91,,
468,0.97,5779.607,5812.306,And that will enhance other efforts that the Council has engaged in to make sure that as a body we are well informed about both impacts to commuters and impacts to the city budget and the possible need to make changes in our other Sdot program commitments in order to facilitate the necessary repair and necessary mitigation during the closer.,91,,
469,0.97,5812.306,5841.769,One thing I also wanted to mention is that I had received some inquiries about the police Department enforcement of the Stay-At-Home order and there were concerns raised at last Monday's Council briefing meetings along with some activity Online about concerns about how this Seattle police Department is going about enforcing the Stay-At-Home order.,91,,
470,0.97,5841.769,5849.276,The chief clearly communicated to me that they're not enforcing or stopping folks for being out and about.,91,,
471,0.97,5849.276,5866.16,Now and the chief is also HT clearly communicated that traffic and other stops should only occur if there is risk to the safety of folks driving vehicles or others.,91,,
472,0.97,5866.16,5875.669,And the intent is to limit exposure and that relates to traffic stops.,91,,
473,0.97,5875.669,5894.288,The chief has been Messaging to the public who have directly contacted her as well that if this up and's with all concerns about police behavior than they are really relying on receiving these details of those experiences.,91,,
474,0.97,5894.288,5916.143,And if an individual officer is taking actions that are not authorized by the recurrent policies around enforcement of Stay-At-Home orders then the chief is committed to looking into those compliance and she has made it very clear that this is not the operational policy of the Department.,91,,
475,0.97,5916.143,5927.454,I have two amendments to two of the bills coming up later on today and in the interest of time they are small mostly technical amendment so I will hold my comments on those because they have already been circulated.,91,,
476,0.97,5927.454,5949.443,One relates to the ordinance for the grocery vouchers and the other relates specifically to the ordinance allowing the city to accept gifts.,91,,
477,0.97,5951.712,5955.149,And the small amendments are in your Inboxes and we can talk about the more at 2:00 today.,91,,
478,0.97,5955.149,5966.493,Lastly I just want to mention that one of the events I am participating in this week is a virtual meeting and presentation for the District 1 community network about my committee work plan and priorities for this year and,91,,
479,0.97,5966.493,5969.697,Thanks Councilmember Lisa Herbold.,92,,
480,0.97,5969.697,5974.001,Any questions for Councilmember Lisa Herbold?,92,,
481,0.97,5974.001,5976.437,Hearing none we will go ahead and move on.,92,,
482,0.97,5976.437,5982.309,Councilmember Tammy Morales had to get off the call and she told us earlier.,92,,
483,0.97,5982.309,5986.18,Did she give report to anyone?,92,,
484,0.97,5986.18,5995.422,It looks like she did not so we will go ahead and go straight to Councilmember Kshama Sawant in district 3.,92,,
485,0.97,5995.422,6003.831,Thank you counsel President Lorena Gonzalez.,93,,
486,0.97,6003.831,6012.539,There are no items on today's city council agenda from the Sustainability and rights committee.,93,,
487,0.97,6012.539,6026.22,"The next regularly scheduled meeting of the committee is on Tuesday, April 20 at 2 PM although of course that will depend on what happens with the Council committee members schedule this coming month and how the Coronavirus crisis evolves in the coming weeks.",93,,
488,0.97,6026.22,6039.233,"My office is planning to host a virtual town hall meeting this Thursday, April 2 and we're setting up technology now and will send out more details along with links to participate once they are ready.",93,,
489,0.97,6039.233,6050.377,As I just last week the Coronavirus crisis is creating economic devastation which is compounding the suffering caused by the illness itself.,93,,
490,0.97,6050.377,6095.022,And of course the families who have lost their loved ones and coworkers who have lost their coworkers and friends who have lost their friends and so we cannot hope to address the crisis with robbing Peter to pay Paul and sacrificing one vitally port and social program to support another which is why we are opposing as I'm sure you have all heard of any a big business to raise significant funds to address the immediate related needs of working people and also to continue into the future as a public program and building affordable social housing and new deal aspects.,93,,
491,0.97,6095.022,6101.595,We will be unveiling legislation publicly earlier this week and I hope to have conversations with the Councilmember about that.,93,,
492,0.97,6101.595,6117.01,The legislation as I'm sure we will all agree even if there is not agreement on the legislation itself is that it is the result of a grassroots movement that we are helping to build and lead for nearly 3 years especially after the last several months.,93,,
493,0.97,6117.01,6135.462,To let my colleagues know that I am allowed to chair the committee where the legislation will be discussed and I have it in my Sustainability and winters rights committee.,93,,
494,0.97,6135.462,6158.452,So that the movement can continue to have a voice as a Council President it is unacceptable to me that this legislation is given its significance that is not in the committee chaired by me but course in the past I have not had objections to having my legislation being discussed in committee shared by the Council members because it's a question of where we think we are in terms of winning and what the role needs to be for the movement.,93,,
495,0.97,6158.452,6165.158,In this case I think it is extremely necessary as the Council members announce they are supporting this legislation and in which case I will greatly welcome that.,93,,
496,0.97,6165.158,6189.917,But in the absence of that I would really urge that the movement have a clear and direct voice by allowing my office to share with the committee and I have offered to Cochair committee and am happy to do that and discuss these options and I look forward to continuing the conversation with Council members and president Gonzales.,93,,
497,0.97,6189.917,6232.759,Finally but not least I would like to express solidarity with all of the Instacart workers who are on strike today across the country as they have been exploiting the Coronavirus pandemic along with the normal exploitation of the workers that has been happening for years and as providers of people doing the work with almost no safety equipment and its quite incredible and the workers have been asking for weeks for simple things I can Sanitizers and sprays and Wipes which the company has refused to pay with the same story with the Amazon delivery station as well and Amazon cargo handlers and delivery drivers reporting their not getting hand Sanitizers for their truck.,93,,
498,0.97,6232.759,6262.256,So it's important that is to cart Instacart shoppers are going on strike and hopefully they will be hundreds of thousands of them participating in the nationwide strike today and in the days leading up to the strike because they are nervous about the strike they make concessions like promising to provide hand Sanitizer but it should be recognized the victory of the movement and the collective action can win.,93,,
499,0.97,6262.256,6312.506,Today the strike demands are safety precautions with no cost to workers and the personal protective equipment and including hand Sanitizers but also beyond that and hazard pay which is an extra five dollars per order along with the inactive and not to at least 10% of the order total and the extension and expansion of pay for workers impacted by Covid- 19 and anyone with a doctor's NOTE for Pre-Existing conditions is a known risk factor or under self quarantine and the full demand is the deadline to qualify for these benefits must be extended and April 8. I just want to use this opportunity to express my solidarity with them and I want to share with the Council that yesterday I have the privilege of interviewing one of the main strike leaders and I will be sharing with that with you soon.,93,,
500,0.97,6312.506,6315.309,Great and thank you so much.,94,,
501,0.97,6315.309,6323.15,Councilmember Kshama Sawant we will go ahead.,94,,
502,0.97,6323.15,6323.517,Ay questions?,94,,
503,0.97,6323.517,6327.888,Hearing none we will go ahead and move over to District 4 with Councilmember Alex Pedersen and the floor is yours.,94,,
504,0.97,6327.888,6333.727,Good evening and good morning it's nice to see everybody.,95,,
505,0.97,6333.727,6335.962,Nice to see you all and I Miss you all.,95,,
506,0.97,6335.962,6370.697,For everyone viewing this cancel briefing just reminder that even though you are hearing about specific initiatives and programs and proposals but the Seattle.Gov Website have great resources there right now and you can go to Www.Seattle.Gov for the neighbors Covid-19 resources and the city Council has its own Website thanks to the work of all of the Council staff who put it together with Seattle.Gov Écounsel.,95,,
507,0.97,6370.697,6374.768,That's very important list of existing resources for folks.,95,,
508,0.97,6374.768,6379.473,On this afternoon's full city council agenda there are no items directly from the transportation and utilities committee.,95,,
509,0.97,6379.473,6388.415,Our committee normally meets on the first and third Wednesdays of each month however there NOTE community meeting scheduled at this time as we respond to go Covid-19 public health crisis.,95,,
510,0.97,6388.415,6400.193,Thanks to the Council President Gonzales and her dedicated team for working with the chairs of the various committees to Prioritize their work loads.,95,,
511,0.97,6400.193,6423.383,We are hearing is the Councilmember mentioned the resolution 31942 which she and I had worked on together to add the West Seattle bridge to the Watchlist capital projects now that it has become a major capital project so that we can take the very intense oversight with Lawrence.,95,,
512,0.97,6423.383,6433.059,And another transportation issue is that we have listened last week and took action to meet the transportation needs of hospital workers to stay healthy and maintain social distancing when they drive to their jobs.,95,,

514,0.97,6437.764,6445.672,There were various parking restrictions around the hospitals which have been relaxed.,95,,
515,0.97,6445.672,6459.986,And the Seattle Department of Transportation had worked with the police Department and the Department of construction and inspections to make this happen and I want to thank them that we Prioritize transportation options for our brave Healthcare workers on the front lines of this crisis.,95,,
516,0.97,6459.986,6474.401,"District 4 and for those watching that live in Eastlake and northeast Seattle, please continue to support small businesses in our district by ordering Takeout meals of local restaurants.",95,,

520,0.97,6500.393,6505.398,Just Email us with Alex Pedersen at Seattle.Gov.,95,,
521,0.97,6505.398,6526.319,That is with the letter d like district and along with a capital E which is the missing D. on the Council agenda today is the resolution from Councilmember Tammy Morales about Evictions and the moratorium on foreclosures.,95,,
522,0.97,6526.319,6549.876,We look forward to discussing that in the Council today and also Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda had circulated a letter which is complementary to that resolution and it zeros in on asking the governor to have a ban on foreclosures during the crisis.,95,,
523,0.97,6549.876,6553.68,Through the other side of the equation when we talk about Evictions and we need to consider foreclosures.,95,,
524,0.97,6553.68,6560.186,So that the banks are not foreclosing on the folks providing housing or providing commercial space.,95,,
525,0.97,6560.186,6569.796,As somebody who had worked at financial institutions let me say this to the banks.,95,,
526,0.97,6569.796,6570.797,"Do the decent things, banks.",95,,
527,0.97,6570.797,6582.175,Do not Foreclose and to make sure you do the right thing we're asking our governor to ban Bank foreclosures during this public health and economic crisis.,95,,
528,0.97,6582.175,6588.515,You have all seen the movie it's a wonderful life and we are asking the banks to be like that character Jimmy Stewart played and not the character who is always foreclosing.,95,,
529,0.97,6588.515,6591.318,Lease to the right thing and thanks very much.,95,,
530,0.97,6591.318,6598.959,Now we meet read the notes of Councilmember Debora Juarez.,95,,
531,0.97,6598.959,6599.626,Yes you can.,96,,
532,0.97,6599.626,6614.507,"And before you do that if that concludes the report, I want to open it up to let you ask any questions about your report.",96,,
533,0.97,6614.507,6615.475,I have comments.,97,,
534,0.97,6615.475,6616.643,Councilmember Kshama Sawant.,98,,
535,0.97,6616.643,6635.762,This is in relation to the resolution of Councilmember Tammy Morales but I will jump in and just say that just for anybody who is listening at this moment outside of this economic counsel with the resolution that calls for a moratorium on rent payments and mortgage payments.,99,,
536,0.97,6635.762,6669.496,Which is a step ahead of auto movement wished for and to the Mayor's executive order on the Council for the Eviction moratorium and foreclosure moratorium and I do think it's important that the rent payments and mortgage payments are suspended and the usability payments also to be suspended through the end of the crisis.,99,,
537,0.97,6669.662,6676.403,Many people have been laid off and lost their wages and the Department of labor announced that overall at least over 3 million people nationwide have lost their jobs just in the last week.,99,,
538,0.97,6676.403,6689.015,This is through using the Uninsurance filings as a measure which windows regularly and underestimate because many part-time workers don't qualify an economy workers don't qualify and self-employed people don't qualify.,99,,
539,0.97,6689.015,6702.829,"We know by that measure that the number of people who have lost their jobs and Washington state is well above what is announced with the Department of labor of over 130,000.",99,,
540,0.97,6702.829,6721.514,"We should imagine that roughly 150 to 200,000 workers are bereft right now and we know that the majority of America lives paycheck to paycheck and there's no way that many of these people will be able to pay their rent and in the case of home owning workers and struggling small businesses they will not be able to pay the rent or mortgage.",99,,
541,0.97,6721.514,6743.67,That's why it's important to call for suspending both and I support this resolution and before the resolution was announced to my office had announced a petition urging the governor statewide to call for suspension of rent and mortgage and utility payments and also the petition calls for rent freeze.,99,,
542,0.97,6743.67,6749.743,Meeting no increases in the monthly rent through the end of 2020.,99,,
543,0.97,6749.743,6764.39,And what is stunning is that we have been told in the position that we are hearing from people around the state that corporate landlords are so Bloodsucking then in the middle of the pandemic are sending rent increase notices to tenant for a couple of months from now.,99,,
544,0.97,6764.39,6767.994,That is unconscionable and we want to make sure there's a suspension of rent and mortgage payments.,99,,
545,0.97,6767.994,6773.5,And a rent freeze meeting no increases in the monthly rent until the end of 2020.,99,,
546,0.97,6773.5,6792.418,And I want to share that our petition has gathered well over 6000 signatures and it will continue to gather as we speak as they are rolling in.,99,,
547,0.97,6792.418,6809.169,"And I'm really excited about this and in fact we are not alone because actually there's a petition in Ohio for example it has gathered over 115,000 signatures and so people are in crisis throughout the nation and throughout Washington State and it is incredibly important that steps are taken because it is March 30th and rent will be due and people will be in crisis immediately.",99,,
548,0.97,6809.169,6813.94,I really urge the quick passage of this resolution and thank you.,99,,
549,0.97,6813.94,6821.848,Thanks Councilmember Kshama Sawant and Alex Pedersen for those remarks.,100,,
550,0.97,6821.848,6841.334,On the resolution that is being sponsored by the Councilmember which we support we want to clarify because we had been receiving Emails and social media traffic on this issue and this seems to be a misunderstanding about what the resolution will accomplish.,100,,
551,0.97,6841.334,6856.783,The resolution will create a statement of the legislative record that we support with the governor to encourage the governor to take this action as it relates to stopping foreclosures and the increases of rent.,100,,
552,0.97,6856.783,6880.406,Some individuals who are advocating for this seem to think the passage of this resolution will in effect freeze rents and stop rent increases and stop foreclosures and I just want to make really clear to the public that this is not what the resolution will accomplish when it is passed this afternoon.,100,,
553,0.97,6880.406,6893.72,Ought to make sure we are not sending out a false expectation about what this resolution will accomplish in the city of Seattle and statewide.,100,,
554,0.97,6893.72,6910.536,Do you want to provide the report for Councilmember Debora Juarez?,100,,
555,0.97,6910.536,6911.237,Yes and thank you.,101,,
556,0.97,6911.237,6924.751,Because we are the vice chair of the committee that they had chaired they asked to read the Council briefing notes and the first one is about the sound transit . Last Thursday they had attended the board of directors meeting and they had made it possible for members to participate locally and to discuss several items such as the Covid-19 impact on a transit systems.,101,,
557,0.97,6924.751,6928.621,And ongoing policy discussions around fair enforcement.,101,,
558,0.97,6928.621,6949.642,Councilmember Debora Juarez wants to thank the many individuals that contacted her about the investment in pilot projects that services low income riders as well as the importance of enforcing protocols from complications of the system.,101,,
559,0.97,6949.642,6961.187,They wholeheartedly stand with this message and advocate for these improvements and they have decided to delay the major policy vote to a later time to allow more attention to the Covid-19 impact.,101,,
560,0.97,6961.187,6980.273,She has a parks update because parks is in her Committee and the Department of works in recreation as we know they temporarily closed some parking lots throughout the city.,101,,
561,0.97,6980.273,6985.011,And parks to discourage people from traveling to the parks and to maintain social distancing protocols.,101,,
562,0.97,6985.011,6993.019,There were some additional parking lots closed and specifically on Washington Boulevard to help limit the amount of people Congregating in parking lots and a parked sites.,101,,
563,0.97,6993.019,7004.03,Councilmember Debora Juarez is continuing to assess these closures to make sure they are addressing social distancing concerns and not having any unintended consequences.,101,,
564,0.97,7004.03,7022.982,These parking lots are pictured Beach and Adams Street and 49th Street and Mount Baker and Coleman park and D street.,101,,
565,0.97,7029.722,7035.762,These measures are not meant to prohibit individuals from using the parks but just to dovetail with the recent closures at other parking lots around the city that service parks.,101,,
566,0.97,7035.762,7040.833,Councilmember Debora Juarez wanted to talk a little bit about the Handwashing stations and imagine other Councilmembers may be talking about that as well.,101,,
567,0.97,7040.833,7060.753,Briefly the Mayor had announced the appointment of 14 toilets with six Handwashing stations near impact did areas and high- impact encampment areas throughout Seattle and one of those includes near the Lake City community center in district 5 if they are open from 7 am until 8 PM and daily maintenance will be provided.,101,,
568,0.97,7060.753,7064.023,That is the Councilmember Debora Juarez report.,101,,
569,0.97,7064.023,7066.592,Thank you Councilmember Alex Pedersen for doing that.,102,,
570,0.97,7066.592,7071.898,Okay I think Councilmember Dan Strauss is doing a tour.,102,,
571,0.97,7071.898,7074.1,Did he leave a report with anyone?,102,,
572,0.97,7074.1,7081.007,It looks like he did not so we will move on to District 7 and Councilmember Andrew Lewis.,102,,
573,0.97,7081.007,7081.541,Take it away.,102,,
574,0.97,7081.541,7089.382,Thanks so much Council President Lorena Gonzalez.,103,,
575,0.97,7089.382,7096.489,First of all can everyone hear me? first of all can everyone hear me?,103,,
576,0.97,7096.489,7097.49,I see nodding so that's great.,103,,
577,0.97,7097.49,7101.727,To start nothing from the select Committee on homelessness and on the Council agenda this afternoon.,103,,
578,0.97,7101.727,7132.391,"I do want to take a moment to recognize as Councilmember Alex Pedersen just did, the deployment of the additional hygiene facilities to provide resources to our neighbors experiencing homelessness in the 14 toilets and six Handwashing stations and soon there will be deployed four hygiene trailers with showers and toilets and Handwashing stations.",103,,
579,0.97,7132.391,7149.075,Also want to note that the navigation team has distributed 1600 hygiene kits to folks experiencing homelessness and to make sure people have the resources to adequately maintain hygiene in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.,103,,
580,0.97,7149.075,7153.779,I am also grateful for the 1900 additional transitional shelter spaces that have been stood up.,103,,
581,0.97,7153.779,7160.253,My committee and I know I have talked to a number of colleagues about this.,103,,
582,0.97,7160.253,7177.069,Is interested in looking into how many of these transitional spaces that we can hang onto and protect on the other side of this outbreak given that we will still have a state of emergency on homelessness when Covid-19 is no longer such an issue.,103,,
583,0.97,7177.069,7212.038,Some of the 1900 spaces I would NOTE include the transitional Encampments that had been budgeted to be stood up by this counsel in the last cycle and I'm proud to say that the South Lake Union encampment in my district has been expanded as one of those sites and I believe additional sites are being stood up by Lehigh and I'm very grateful for that response.,103,,
584,0.97,7212.038,7227.32,I do want to say on the introduction referral calendar unrelated to the Committee on homelessness that have put forward a resolution on creating a way for workers to come up with some recommendations on performance auditing.,103,,
585,0.97,7227.32,7229.355,This was a big issue I talked about during the campaign.,103,,
586,0.97,7229.355,7241.067,I know number of folks on this counsel have a long and Well- established interest in the audit function of our Department.,103,,
587,0.97,7241.067,7274.4,I think it is often forgotten by the general public that the office of auditors a legislative branch position and a very Impactful office that has done significant work to make sure that the ordinances of this counsel are carried out in an efficacious way and that there is response from the executive branch to the request and the desires of the Council and that the money that we as a Council budget and approve is being spent effectively to realize the goals and the policy goals of the Council.,103,,
588,0.97,7274.4,7283.409,I look forward to having that conversation as that resolution develops and more conversations One-On-One over the coming weeks.,103,,
589,0.97,7283.409,7295.521,Also want to echo the comments we look forward to the discussion on the Councilmember Morales resolution on the moratorium on rent and mortgages.,103,,
590,0.97,7295.521,7336.762,And the actor that had played Mr. Potter and Councilmember Peterson and I want to echo your comments that all of our bankers need to aspire to be like Lionel Barrymore and you cannot take it with you and it's not like it's a wonderful life and this is critical and important and I agree with you and I want to make sure this moment of crisis that we don't want anyone to be foreclosed on out in the street and make want to make sure we're leaning on this is a Council and a nation at all levels of government and the resolution is a good step in the right direction.,103,,
591,0.97,7336.762,7348.374,"Moving onto the last thing I want to touch on before completing the report, I know it is hard to focus on this given everything that is going on as a city and as a country.",103,,
592,0.97,7348.374,7376.402,And the other day when I took my daily outside of my apartment activity of getting my mail I went downstairs and I noticed in the bin where junk mail was thrown out and folks asking you to sign up for credit card or Unsanctioned advertisements or coupons and there was an alarming number of census cards that had been thrown into that been with all of the junk mail.,103,,
593,0.97,7376.402,7389.215,Out to make a quick plea here at the briefing for all of you watching to go and fill out the census.,103,,
594,0.97,7389.215,7399.525,It is extremely easy and extremely important for us as a city and is a region that we be adequately represented and that folks come Online and fill out the Census and get their Informaion in.,103,,
595,0.97,7399.525,7403.763,It's very simple and you can go to my 2020 Census and it's spelled out in numbers and not letters.,103,,
596,0.97,7403.763,7411.937,My 2020 Census.Gov all one word.,103,,
597,0.97,7411.937,7418.244,It's critical for the future of our democracy since congressional delegates and congressional districts and legislative districts are drawn based on the numbers in the census.,103,,
598,0.97,7418.244,7431.223,"For the city of Seattle to get her adequate chair representation in Washington, D.C. and in Olympia, it's critical that you go Online to make it clear that you live here in the city of Seattle.",103,,
599,0.97,7431.223,7442.768,It's critical for our share of Federal money for all of the projects that we feel really deeply for and that we feel a deep need for.,103,,
600,0.97,7442.768,7455.247,Just to give a couple of examples of snout funds and free and reduced lunch and Medicaid and Headstart programs and community mental health.,103,,
601,0.97,7455.247,7475.701,The West Seattle bridge that we had talked about earlier with infrastructure spending and all of these funds are distributed by the Federal Government and by the state government and part proportional to representation of population.,103,,
602,0.97,7475.701,7478.37,It's critical for those of you watching at home and the Census is important.,103,,
603,0.97,7478.37,7483.609,I know there's a lot going on right now but make sure you go Online to my 2020 Census.Gov and make sure you are heard and,103,,
604,0.97,7483.609,7485.878,With that Madam President I don't have any further remarks.,104,,
605,0.97,7485.878,7489.448,Thanks Councilmember Andrew Lewis.,105,,
606,0.97,7489.448,7497.99,Other any questions or comments for Councilmember Andrew Lewis?,105,,
607,0.97,7497.99,7498.824,It's the hand raising.,106,,
608,0.97,7498.824,7501.927,I can see you are raising your hands and it makes it a little easier.,107,,
609,0.97,7501.927,7521.447,Go with picks in thanks for making the plug about the Census and we had similar thoughts and anxiety . around people being distracted from carrying out this very important function and a really appreciate you raising the importance.,107,,
610,0.97,7521.447,7536.462,Councilmember Andrew Lewis I have a question about part of your report related to specifically the hand washing stations and the public bathrooms.,107,,
611,0.97,7536.462,7540.733,Those are located in six locations throughout the city.,107,,
612,0.97,7540.733,7555.18,14 bathrooms that are in some cases it just means they have two Bathroomsat a single location and they are only to my knowledge of my understanding six locations throughout the city.,107,,
613,0.97,7555.18,7573.599,I'm getting some conflicting information about the executives intent to expand that beyond the six locations and I'm just wondering is on the one hand I have heard that they are considering additional locations.,107,,
614,0.97,7573.599,7592.518,But I'm not really clear on the process or the timing on that I'm just wondering whether or not you have heard from the executive about the long-term plan around this really important need for our Un- housed population.,107,,
615,0.97,7592.518,7609.001,We have a Covid-19 crisis on our hands and we don't want other public health emergencies to arise because of Communicable diseases that could be spread from lack of access to bathrooms.,107,,
616,0.97,7609.001,7632.524,Even though we don't have as many public Restrooms as we would like in the city at the fact that so many public buildings have been closed and so many businesses are closed is really having a profound impact on the ability of our and sheltered population to access basic hygiene.,107,,
617,0.97,7632.524,7636.428,Thank you Councilmember Lisa Herbold for that question.,108,,
618,0.97,7636.428,7642.468,I share the same commitment that so many of us on the Council share and making sure that we stand up these hygiene facilities.,108,,
619,0.97,7642.468,7660.986,It was one of our specifically enumerated and all the way back at the beginning of the crisis one of our specifically enumerated requests and are resolution to the executive at the beginning that these locations be stood up.,108,,
620,0.97,7660.986,7664.089,"At this time, I don't have any additional information about additional sites that are planned.",108,,
621,0.97,7664.089,7678.47,It's one of the things that upon hearing about this and the confirmation of the sites that are being stood up that I had asked the executive last Friday.,108,,
622,0.97,7678.47,7690.816,I have not heard a response yet but things are moving very quickly and it's one of the things on my agenda today to circle back and it's important and I know it's a priority for all of us as a Council.,108,,
623,0.97,7690.816,7692.918,Thank you Councilmember Andrew Lewis.,109,,
624,0.97,7692.918,7695.487,I appreciate you following up and I look forward to hearing more.,109,,
625,0.97,7695.487,7710.536,It was very difficult for me to both applaud the standing up of the six locations while also being really disappointed that there are so few when the need is so great picks are really appreciate your focus on this issue as well.,109,,
626,0.97,7710.536,7716.041,Thanks Councilmember for highlighting that.,110,,
627,0.97,7716.041,7725.35,I know a lot of us have been doing a lot of work in the space for many years and we sort of share your conflicting sentiment there as it relates to this issue.,110,,
628,0.97,7725.35,7728.42,We appreciate that.,110,,
629,0.97,7728.42,7732.858,We will go ahead and move along.,111,,
630,0.97,7732.858,7743.268,We are now going to hear from Councilmember Lisa Herbold with the report for Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda in position eight.,111,,
631,0.97,7743.268,7753.378,Yes and Council members Teresa Mosqueda asked a report on two pieces of legislation on the full council agenda today for consideration.,112,,
632,0.97,7753.378,7757.483,The first is Countable 11 9763.,112,,
633,0.97,7757.483,7768.794,This relates specifically to the goal of being able to quickly deploy resources from private donations or grants quickly to provide Covid-19 relief to our communities.,112,,
634,0.97,7768.794,7780.172,This will relax some requirements that are typically in place for the deployment of resources from private donations or grants.,112,,
635,0.97,7780.172,7794.82,But Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda I noticed that while relaxing these requirements it's really important to have transparency and oversight and how we are allocating these dollars.,112,,
636,0.97,7794.82,7809.234,As a Council it's important that we understand the full picture of dollars going to support various needs such as small business support and food assistance and homelessness support etc.,112,,
637,0.97,7809.234,7812.237,And that we are able to make informed decisions about other expenditures.,112,,
638,0.97,7812.237,7816.708,She has an amendment to this bill that will require weekly reporting on how these funds are being spent.,112,,
639,0.97,7816.708,7818.41,So that we are able to maintain proper oversight.,112,,
640,0.97,7818.41,7827.119,And that we can enable the expedient direction of these funds to where they are most needed in the community.,112,,
641,0.97,7827.119,7836.929,Earlier we had an amendment to this bill and my amendment is actually considered a friendly amendment.,112,,
642,0.97,7836.929,7849.474,It simply adds to her reporting requirements that will also include the categories of use as described as permissible uses in the resolution itself.,112,,
643,0.97,7849.474,7858.784,The second piece of legislation that Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda is answering and that she also has an amendment for his counsel bill 11 9764.,112,,
644,0.97,7858.784,7878.57,Which creates a new $5 million grocery voucher program in the office of Sustainability and environment to support 6250 low income families facing food insecurity because of the response to Covid-19.,112,,
645,0.97,7878.57,7898.624,The program itself is founded with sugary beverage tax revenues and due to the crisis we are in we decided to Reallocate some of the funds that were going to parks in the Department neighborhoods and the committee advisory board for the sugary beverage fund that is supportive of the reallocation of the funds.,112,,
646,0.97,7898.624,7912.537,"And due to the large number of layoffs during Covid-19, when he to really make sure that we are getting families food at this really crisis time that can increase food and",112,,
647,0.97,7912.537,7930.956,Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda notes she is on it that the dollars are being used at a union grocery store where workers are receiving stronger supports and resources to perform the various central services.,113,,
648,0.97,7930.956,7937.062,And she wants me to note that she has this on her as somebody who has worked in labor and public health for over a decade.,113,,
649,0.97,7937.062,7945.17,She has heard a lot from employers that they are defending the minimum wage.,113,,
650,0.97,7945.17,7947.939,And that they defend health insurance.,113,,
651,0.97,7947.939,7955.881,Because these are Entry-Level jobs.,113,,
652,0.97,7955.881,7967.492,And that this is something that I think that employers might have divergent opinions about.,113,,
653,0.97,7967.492,7977.602,But right now we are seeing that janitors and custodial services and Lpns and home care workers and grocery workers and nurses and residents and doctors in training and doctors are so essential.,113,,
654,0.97,7977.602,7990.015,I think that is really important to hold as we consider during this time of crisis.,113,,
655,0.97,7990.015,7994.319,And the commitment that we have is a city to worker standards.,113,,
656,0.97,7994.319,7996.688,And they are so essential to keep her committee from collapse.,113,,
657,0.97,7996.688,8001.026,Many of these folks are doing so for very low wages.,113,,
658,0.97,8001.026,8012.204,And she makes a note that when this is over she hopes that we take time to pay and respect all of these workers for what they are doing and what they have done for us during this crisis.,113,,
659,0.97,8012.204,8028.02,And I just want to flag that I have an amendment to this bill that request that ONC pursue partnerships beyond Safeway with additional retailers with a preference for those were also unionized to expand retail operations for households receiving a Marsh emergency grocery vouchers.,113,,
660,0.97,8028.02,8033.925,I have heard from constituents that have contacted me about helping hoping we can expand this beyond Safeway.,113,,
661,0.97,8033.925,8038.73,That is the end of the Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda report.,113,,
662,0.97,8038.73,8052.043,Thanks and we will move on to the final report for today.,114,,
663,0.97,8052.043,8052.978,Which is my report.,114,,
664,0.97,8052.978,8062.988,Councilmember Lisa Herbold touched on it a little bit via this amendment to the counsel bill with agenda item one which is a bill that I am the primary sponsor for as described by Councilmember Lisa Herbold.,114,,
665,0.97,8062.988,8063.655,My apologies.,115,,
666,0.97,8063.655,8064.189,No it's okay.,116,,
667,0.97,8064.189,8066.858,It's all right.,116,,
668,0.97,8066.858,8069.694,It is a bill designed to allow for philanthropic.,116,,
669,0.97,8069.694,8078.403,And corporate partners to donate resources to assist people and businesses in need.,116,,
670,0.97,8078.403,8088.18,Article 1 section 1 of the charity provides that the city of Seattle makes up gifts and donations of all kinds in dual access to carry out the purposes of gifts and donations.,116,,
671,0.97,8088.18,8099.891,We do have some language in the Seattle municipal code that allows during the period for them to advance gifts or loans with the counsel considering appropriate legislation to allow for that acceptance.,116,,
672,0.97,8099.891,8117.642,This legislation Effectuates that language and our charter and or municipal code while creating a new Fund and the city Treasury for gifts and donations and grants to the city to assist in management and recovery from this crisis.,116,,
673,0.97,8117.642,8127.152,We will go into greater detail about what the bill will accomplish a 2:00 during the full council but it was a straightforward piece of legislation and a lot of people have been asking how can I help in getting gauged.,116,,
674,0.97,8127.152,8169.794,And there's a lot of Nonprofits that have established relief funds that labor unions have established some worker relief funds and now this is the city's opportunity to create a similar relief fund opportunity to supplement some of the work that we are doing in this space and of course we are contacted by many private interest who won't want to give gifts or contributions to the city of Seattle as we look at and work around meeting the needs created by this crisis.,116,,
675,0.97,8169.794,8173.298,And this is our tool to be able to do that.,116,,
676,0.97,8173.298,8179.804,We are really excited about being able to sponsor that legislation and please consider the amendments that will be put forward as at 2 PM as friendly amendments to that legislation.,116,,
677,0.97,8179.804,8197.822,Secondly I would say that last Friday I believe we had received an additional executive order from the Mayor related to providing emergency Childcare to first responders and other essential workers throughout the city.,116,,
678,0.97,8197.822,8205.797,We are in the process of evaluating that executive order.,116,,
679,0.97,8205.797,8219.611,Is the chair the committee responsible for education I take very seriously the need to make sure that the proposed Repurpose seeing of the levy dollars is within the Purview of the ordinance.,116,,
680,0.97,8219.611,8222.547,Even in light of a declared civil emergency related to this particular issue.,116,,
681,0.97,8222.547,8235.06,So I am working closely with central staff and I have been in communication for the past week with the executives and talking about the proposal and the funding source.,116,,
682,0.97,8235.06,8259.851,Obviously very supportive of the desire to provide Childcare to essential workers and we really appreciate that the services will be provided not just for firefighters and not just for police officers but also grocery workers and others who are also being required to continue to go to work as essential workers.,116,,
683,0.97,8259.851,8275.567,"So hopefully we will be able to close the Loop sometime this week and if a resolution is necessary on the issue than the resolution will be considered on Monday, April 6 so you can stay tuned and watch your Inboxes for additional information about that executive order.",116,,
684,0.97,8275.567,8315.907,Lastly I will say that we have started a story bank to collect stories related to her counsel bill's and to create additional defenses for Covid-19 as related economic issues for not being able to pay rent as well as creating a Pathway for tenants to come up with a payment plan if tenants fall behind on their rent as a result of losing their job or income as a result of Covid-19 business closures.,116,,
685,0.97,8315.907,8331.122,We are excited that we were able to launch that effort last Friday and we are asking folks to share their stories with us of how they are engaging with their landlords or how there notes are engaging with them.,116,,
686,0.97,8331.122,8359.551,And by Eli Manning us the stories to see what within Corona and diagnosis and 19 underscore rent at Seattle.Read that GOP and you can go to the social media handles with Gonzales with a Z at the end to find a link to the Google document to submit those stories as well.,116,,
687,0.97,8359.551,8384.175,When it to make sure it's important we are building at legislative record in part and parcel is to hear directly from people who are being negatively impacted by the rental market and who are experiencing significant economic issues as a result of having to lose their job and go and unemployment as a result of their business being closed because of the pandemic.,116,,
688,0.97,8384.175,8391.216,So we're really excited about being able to launch this effort and looking forward to reading many of the stories that I'm sure will be shared.,116,,
689,0.97,8391.216,8394.686,Happy to answer any questions.,117,,
690,0.97,8394.686,8402.227,Not a question but I do appreciate this opportunity to share with the viewing public.,118,,
691,0.97,8402.227,8436.761,Because of your remarks I am reminded that one thing that we are hearing from landlords is concern about not being able to access the city and the States Eviction prevention resources and have confirmed with the Mayor's office because we have the moratorium in place that prohibits members from issuing difficulty under our current programs to access rent assistance.,118,,
692,0.97,8436.761,8443.268,Previously rent assistance could only be accessed if you have an Eviction notice.,118,,
693,0.97,8443.268,8448.94,And so the executive is changing those requirements.,118,,
694,0.97,8448.94,8457.882,To allow tenants to access the Eviction resources or I'm sorry the rent assistance resources if they have a bill.,118,,
695,0.97,8457.882,8472.497,So as we are making it and addressing the needs of tenants under this really difficult economic crisis.,118,,
696,0.97,8472.497,8476.968,I really just want to thank the executive for working to address some of the needs of small landlords.,118,,
697,0.97,8476.968,8488.713,I want to thank you also Councilmember and Council President Gonzales for your creation of the timely payment plans.,118,,
698,0.97,8488.713,8514.739,It is similar to a bill that I have on the referral calendar today related to the commercial moratorium and I think it's really important that within the context of rent moratoriums on whether or not you're talking about residential rent moratoriums or commercial rent moratoriums but that we create a pass somewhere between not paying the rent at all or having to pay all of the rent.,118,,
699,0.97,8514.739,8523.448,I think these timed payment programs creates that pass for people who can contribute some money to the rent as they move forward.,118,,
700,0.97,8523.448,8535.727,And I also appreciate obviously the your legislation also helps people once we get outside of the Covid-19 crisis.,118,,
701,0.97,8535.727,8538.463,"And then Lastly, I really love the idea of collecting stories.",118,,
702,0.97,8538.463,8548.473,I think that is not only useful for the legislative foundation of the policy that we are creating.,118,,
703,0.97,8548.473,8557.982,But it's also really important just to highlight sort of what the practices are and what some of the better practices are.,118,,
704,0.97,8557.982,8579.904,Today we read about the North Seattle mobile home park landlord who is showing a great deal of flexibility with the residence there and also I have heard a number of similar stories and personal friends were sending me notes that they had received from their landlords of real expressions of grace in this difficult time.,118,,
705,0.97,8579.904,8599.924,I have also heard Unfortunately of landlords raising the rents for all of the tenants in the buildings out of an assumption that some tenants will be able to pay the increased rents because it's a building that has mixed income and has high income earners as well as low income earners.,118,,
706,0.97,8599.924,8610.635,This landlord is assuming that the low income earners will use the opportunities created by the Eviction moratorium and not pay the rent.,118,,
707,0.97,8610.635,8622.013,But by assessing large rent increases to all tenants in the buildings in this particular landlord is hoping to make up the difference from his higher income tenants.,118,,
708,0.97,8622.013,8637.695,I think it's really important that we get all of the stories out with the good and the bad and ugly so thanks for creating the ability to do that and I will let the person who reported this particular instance to me know about this opportunity because they are concerned about the public about this unfortunate practice.,118,,
709,0.97,8637.695,8648.072,I appreciate that.,119,,
710,0.97,8648.439,8659.617,I could not agree more and I echo the comments and I appreciate the support of all of you as my colleagues as we continue to collect these stories to make sure we have a full Holistic understanding of what is happening out there in the rental market during this crisis.,119,,
711,0.97,8659.617,8662.186,We greatly appreciate it.,119,,
712,0.97,8662.186,8677.068,And the Councilmember you have bills related to commercial rent moratoriums on the calendar and we did not have an opportunity to talk about that we are close to noon at this point.,119,,
713,0.97,8677.068,8686.21,But we look forward to learning more about what you envision to be the process and the legislative process in terms of timing and consideration of the bill.,119,,
714,0.97,8686.21,8691.416,We are hoping to be able to Considerbills sometime in April.,119,,
715,0.97,8691.416,8695.319,And would you think your bill is obviously a good complement to the work that we are doing.,119,,
716,0.97,8695.319,8714.238,In addition to a good complement to the letter to the governor and the resolution to the governor encouraging not just a relief for mentors but also for homeowners who are going to be faced with mortgages and mortgage payments being due here pretty soon.,119,,
717,0.97,8714.238,8726.651,And make no mistake that there are a significant number of people who are now on the roles of unemployment benefits who will be seeing only partial wage replacement.,119,,
718,0.97,8726.651,8736.327,Any of those homes whether they are rented or Mortgaged are people who are currently experiencing unemployment.,119,,
719,0.97,8736.327,8737.762,Some for the first time in their lives.,119,,
720,0.97,8737.762,8749.373,I think it's important for us to make sure that we are looking at the full spectrum of who will be feeling the crunch of the economic crisis as it relates to housing costs.,119,,
721,0.97,8749.373,8752.376,Okay and any other comments from my colleagues?,120,,
722,0.97,8752.376,8753.177,Okay.,120,,
723,0.97,8753.177,8756.28,Hearing none.,120,,
724,0.97,8756.28,8759.283,Before we conclude because that is the end of our agenda.,120,,
725,0.97,8759.283,8771.696,I really want to think our technology folks with Ian and Eric and others for making Videoconferencing possible for us.,120,,
726,0.97,8771.696,8774.165,Thanks to all of the technology folks in the legislative Department.,120,,
727,0.97,8774.165,8778.402,And of course things start counsel central clerk's office.,120,,
728,0.97,8778.402,8786.01,And to Tom with the central staff who is on the line available to answer any questions.,120,,
729,0.97,8786.01,8796.988,But there were not any substantive questions on any of the amendments for the bills that you will be hearing.,120,,
730,0.97,8796.988,8798.923,Thanks to everyone who was on the call today.,120,,
731,0.97,8798.923,8802.426,It was really good to see all of your faces and we will see you at 2 PM.,120,,
732,0.97,8802.426,8807.398,We are attend.,120,,
733,0.97,8807.398,8808.466,,121,,
