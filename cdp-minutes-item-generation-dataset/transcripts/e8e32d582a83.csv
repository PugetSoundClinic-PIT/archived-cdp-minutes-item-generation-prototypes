14,0.97,81.014,91.191,On the alternative of the criminal legal system and I want to thank the staff part of this presentation this morning leading to the afternoon.,2,,
15,0.97,91.191,95.862,Amy Gore and Lisa K and Jeff Simms and Oshi.,2,,
16,0.97,95.862,103.069,I think we are on your slide and I see slide 14 pulled up here.,2,,
17,0.97,103.069,105.171,Thank you for walking us through this fees.,2,,
18,0.97,105.171,110.376,Are we ready to move onto the next slide.,2,,
19,0.97,110.376,110.743,Yes.,3,,
20,0.97,110.743,123.523,I think we are at the stage of talking about issue number two which is electronic home monitoring subsidy.,3,,
21,0.97,123.523,123.923,Perfect.,4,,
22,0.97,123.923,124.123,Okay.,4,,
23,0.97,124.123,126.559,Let's get started on slide 15.,4,,
24,0.97,126.559,130.497,Great.,5,,
25,0.97,130.497,139.772,So electronic home monitoring for the public's awareness is a alternative to Incarceration and in which a person is monitored by Gps device.,5,,
26,0.97,139.772,163.563,So there can be a restriction on where they go and times at which they have to be in a certain location such as returning home by a particular time and so as it currently stands the Seattle municipal court uses Dhm instead of pretrial Incarceration and as alternative to Incarceration when an individual has been sentenced to a mandatory minimum jail term.,5,,
27,0.97,163.563,189.689,There is concerns raised about the use of Phm as an alternative to Incarceration and some in the task force on the legal system and the recommendations are nice to replace Incarceration with Ehm with alternative form of surveillance.,5,,
28,0.97,189.689,195.895,And so these considerations primarily inform the decisions that a judge makes when that decision is discretionary.,5,,
29,0.97,195.895,211.077,And so if a judge has the option to assign Ehm or Incarceration versus releasing somebody pretrial without conditions there are cautions about using Ehm as a form of surveillance.,5,,
30,0.97,211.077,220.553,"However, there are some situations in which the judge does not have a discretion because of the way that state law is set up.",5,,
31,0.97,220.553,241.541,So particularly in cases of Duis there are state laws that require some level of supervision and so that can be either in the form of Ehm or in the form of Incarceration and so in those situations if a judge would prefer not to incarcerate or put somebody on Ehm they don't have the discretion to make that decision.,5,,
32,0.97,241.541,254.821,They are required to do it and Ehm can can in those situations the less restrictive alternative in comparison to Incarcerating somebody.,5,,
33,0.97,254.821,269.168,"In the 2022 proposed budget, there is an addition of $88,000 that would add to an existing $43,800 in the base budget to provide subsidies for electronic home monitoring.",5,,
34,0.97,269.168,282.615,Regardless of whether the decision of the judge to put somebody on Ehm is mandatory or discretionary it is the defendants that have to pay the costs of Ehm.,5,,
35,0.97,282.615,298.998,"So in cases where Ehm or Incarceration is mandatory there can be an equity issue in terms of whether a defendant can actually pay the costs of the Ehm because if they can't, then they may end up being incarcerated instead.",5,,
36,0.97,298.998,323.189,"For the purposes of increasing funding for the purpose, the court has and the budget includes included $88,000 Decisionly to its budget so that people that cannot afford--cannot afford Ehm, defendants that can't afford it are able to access it by use of this subsidy.",5,,
37,0.97,323.189,333.433,So for your consideration there are two sets of options on this slide and in the issue Id paper.,5,,
38,0.97,333.433,337.17,The first is about mandatory supervision.,5,,
39,0.97,337.17,346.579,So in this circumstance where a judge has the discretion to assign Ehm to a defendant.,5,,
40,0.97,346.579,354.654,Because of the concerns reflected in the task force report releasing people without conditions whatsoever.,5,,
41,0.97,354.654,369.001,"And so if there is interest from the counsel side in limiting the use of these funds over to where supervision is mandatory, in the case of Duis there is a couple of options.",5,,
42,0.97,369.001,384.751,Option Awould maintain the allocation in the budget and provided that funds require when Ehm is mandated by state law and B is not to provide those funds but question evaluation and that evaluation can be about any number of things.,5,,
43,0.97,384.751,397.396,It could be at racial Disproportion Ality and the assignment of Ehm and whether the surveillance is replacing Incarceration and expanding the kind of supervision that the courts are using.,5,,
44,0.97,397.396,411.043,Whether Ehm because it is being used in place of Incarceration is actually increasing the conditions under which somebody is under and there are a variety of other considerations that an evaluation could shed light on.,5,,
45,0.97,411.043,432.765,And then an option AC would be not to provide those funds but depending on the Council's views on the use of Ehm as a mandatory form of supervision include some priorities in the city state legislative agenda to go towards the state considering whether mandatory supervision should be included as part of Duis.,5,,
46,0.97,432.765,445.645,Or if there is option B that is to take no act to allow the allocation to move forward without any restriction.,5,,
47,0.97,445.645,448.214,And there are options here regarding funding source.,5,,
48,0.97,448.214,460.56,And so Similarly the discussion we had earlier in terms of filing for diversion and trying to fund the sort of allocation using existing funds from within the criminal legal system.,5,,
49,0.97,460.56,473.406,Either from the Seattle police Department and the city attorney's offices and criminal division or from the Seattle municipal court itself.,5,,
50,0.97,473.406,477.109,Or to take no action.,5,,
51,0.97,477.109,478.177,Thank you.,6,,
52,0.97,478.177,482.181,Councilmember Herbold and then Lewis.,6,,
53,0.97,482.181,484.851,Councilmember Morales as well.,7,,
54,0.97,484.851,499.499,"Just to understand option A1, if the funds were provided so they can be used Ehm as mandated, that means the funds would not be available when Ehm is discretionary.",8,,
55,0.97,499.499,518.484,"So the judge in those cases are folks that could not afford the cost associated with Ehm and those discretionary cases, the only option would be jail for them, right?",8,,
56,0.97,518.484,518.918,Not necessarily.,9,,
57,0.97,518.918,521.087,I guess I shouldn't say the only option.,10,,
58,0.97,521.087,524.59,We don't have any influence over which option is chosen.,10,,
59,0.97,524.59,524.957,Correct.,11,,
60,0.97,524.957,530.429,And that could be an outcome that have decision.,12,,
61,0.97,530.429,543.309,Because we don't get to choose whether or not a judge--the sentence that the judge choose.,12,,
62,0.97,543.309,550.516,"Yes, that's correct.",13,,
63,0.97,550.516,551.017,Okay.,14,,
64,0.97,551.017,556.422,Thank you for the clarifying question.,14,,
65,0.97,556.422,557.456,Couple member Lewis and then Morales.,14,,
66,0.97,557.456,593.926,"Thank you Madam chair related to Councilmember Herbold's clarifying questions, you know my preference would probably be for A2, mostly because I do get concerns about if we were to use Provisos where things are mandated by state law I don't want us to be in a position where we have inadvertently created a scenario where more people are serving jail terms because Dhm has been prevented.",15,,
67,0.97,593.926,596.829,And this is just sort of alike a Privatism thing.,15,,
68,0.97,596.829,605.805,I am not necessarily coming Ãšhere and giving a big endorsement to Dhm that something that I think is great.,15,,
69,0.97,605.805,617.483,But I am making a very clear value judgment that Ehm is superior to jail.,15,,
70,0.97,617.483,619.185,Better outcomes.,15,,
71,0.97,619.185,619.919,More like cheaper.,15,,
72,0.97,619.919,622.455,People are not put in an experience of Incarceration unnecessarily.,15,,
73,0.97,622.455,650.616,And I would want to make sure that we are not--I want to make sure we are evaluating and assessing the efficacy of Dhm and developing alternatives that can be even less restrictive than Ehm but I don't want to be in a position that we would accidentally create incentives when judges are faced with a choice because it is not just about when people are serving a sentence.,15,,
74,0.97,650.616,658.591,This is alter a critical tool for when people are pending their trial.,15,,
75,0.97,658.591,674.173,And as alternative for setting bail or alternative for holding people in jail prior to having a trial to determine if they are going to be sentenced to anything.,15,,
76,0.97,674.173,679.645,A lot of the decisions are made with very small information from the judge.,15,,
77,0.97,679.645,706.005,"They have to make a risk reward assess, and the risk assessment in determining what level of restriction to put someone under while awaiting trial and I would want to make sure when they are in situations like that, like a pretrial release scenario, we are not removing this as an option or Stymieing this as an option.",15,,
78,0.97,706.005,724.757,And inadvertently creating a situation where judges are instead Airing to set bail in the King County jail.,15,,
79,0.97,724.99,731.263,I think I would favor not the funds.,15,,
80,0.97,731.263,731.597,Thank you.,16,,
81,0.97,731.597,732.098,Councilmember Morales.,16,,
82,0.97,732.098,732.865,Great minds think alike.,17,,
83,0.97,732.865,737.303,That is what I thought of.,17,,
84,0.97,737.303,741.974,If we choose option A1 it would increase pretrial detention.,17,,
85,0.97,741.974,800.199,I agree with Councilmember Lewis about which of these options to select but I think it is worth pointing out the comments that Ashtra includes in her memo that a judge can release without conditions given that we are talking about Misdemeanors here and I realize that there are different risk assessments as Councilmember Lewis is pointing out but if we are trying to begin approaching our work to the criminal legal system with a goal towards harm reduction I would like to see us--if we choose this evaluation route that I would be interested to see in the end whether there was some options that could lead us closer to releasing without conditions at all when this is possible.,17,,
86,0.97,800.199,802.835,Thank you very much Morales.,18,,
87,0.97,802.835,804.203,I see Councilmember Herbold's hands.,18,,
88,0.97,804.203,812.511,I just want to add that I am interested in the funding source option as well.,19,,
89,0.97,812.511,831.597,Option A. and related to making sure that any funding for Ehm subsidies is coming from the criminal legal system rather than expanding the size of the Footprint of those budgets.,19,,
90,0.97,831.597,834.033,That's the funding source option a.,19,,
91,0.97,834.033,834.6,Thank you.,20,,
92,0.97,834.6,845.411,Any other comments on funding source comments identified here?,20,,
93,0.97,845.411,845.711,Excellent.,20,,
94,0.97,845.711,858.657,Thank you for flagging these options Ashtra and Councilmembers indications of the way you are leading.,20,,
95,0.97,858.657,862.828,Shall we continue to public safety investments?,20,,
96,0.97,862.828,863.028,Mute.,20,,
97,0.97,863.028,863.395,"Sorry, Ashtra.",20,,
98,0.97,863.395,863.796,I'm so sorry.,21,,
99,0.97,863.796,871.17,"That wraps up the last issue and if we could move to the next slide I will pass it over to my colleague, Amy.",21,,
100,0.97,871.17,877.977,Thanks your all of your work Ashtra.,22,,
101,0.97,877.977,878.277,"Hello, Amy.",22,,
102,0.97,878.277,879.945,"Thank you, Ashstra.",23,,
103,0.97,879.945,881.413,Thank you Councilmembers.,23,,
104,0.97,881.413,888.487,I am from Council central staff and the next portion of the presentation focuses on community lab public safety programs.,23,,
105,0.97,888.487,892.691,And as we discussed yesterday.,23,,
106,0.97,892.691,902.301,There is a continuum of programs which contribute to community safety including affordable housing and job skills and training and mental health treatment and many others.,23,,
107,0.97,902.301,907.907,For this paper presentation we try to focus on those programs with the nexus for the criminal legal system.,23,,
108,0.97,907.907,913.078,First I want to mention and briefly describe some of the programs that are discussed in the Beeper.,23,,
109,0.97,913.078,922.621,And provide an opportunity for questions and then we will present three issues that central staff identified for Council's consideration.,23,,
110,0.97,922.621,940.439,The programs highlighted in the paper include the community safety capacity building program that provides groups working towards community solutions and violence to increased safety and for people of black and Brown indigenous people in communities.,23,,
111,0.97,940.439,943.342,I will discuss this further.,23,,
112,0.97,943.342,945.644,I wanted to highly the peace keeper's collective.,23,,
113,0.97,945.644,955.321,The pilot program designed to reduce gun violence through a public health model and they run through King County public health.,23,,
114,0.97,955.321,959.124,And include organizations and activities in South Seattle and South King County.,23,,
115,0.97,959.124,974.84,"The program was funded with $500,000 as part of the 2021 mid year supplemental legislation and at that time the expectation was that there would be an additional 5 million for 2022 that is included in the budget.",23,,
116,0.97,974.84,986.985,The lead program that stands for let everyone advance with dignity for people that commit law violations with health issues and extreme poverty.,23,,
117,0.97,986.985,992.257,Jeff will cover this program more.,23,,
118,0.97,992.257,998.297,And Reentry services sometimes called Re-Routing services and support Permeation they transition out of Incarceration or Institutionalization.,23,,
119,0.97,998.297,1018.851,"The programs provide a variety of support services including educational opportunities, job training and work force development with the goal of helping individuals heal and gain meaningful employment and reenter the community and reduce Recidivism.",23,,
120,0.97,1018.851,1022.221,The 2022 proposed budget includes two new Reentry investments.,23,,
121,0.97,1022.221,1028.761,"The first is $75,000 as part of the 1.2 million for the services for the American Indian and Alaska native community.",23,,
122,0.97,1028.761,1047.046,The second is 1.5 million that is part of the equitable community's initiative that as we discussed yesterday is in addition to the 1.5 million for that purpose in 2021 which is not been contracted out yet.,23,,
123,0.97,1047.046,1050.516,Although I saw that Rp was released just today.,23,,
124,0.97,1050.516,1050.816,Let's see.,23,,
125,0.97,1050.816,1065.798,I will pause before we go to issue identification and if there are any general questions about these or other programs in the budget.,23,,
126,0.97,1065.798,1066.999,"Thank you, Amy.",24,,
127,0.97,1066.999,1072.771,I see Councilmember Juarez thumbs up.,24,,
128,0.97,1072.771,1077.776,She likes it.,24,,
129,0.97,1077.776,1078.477,All right.,24,,
130,0.97,1078.477,1078.844,Great.,24,,
131,0.97,1078.844,1087.352,I am not as familiar with the leads expansion and many positions and more service extensions that they are familiar with.,24,,
132,0.97,1087.352,1091.223,Can you reply me there was a recent report that came back to expand leads.,24,,
133,0.97,1091.223,1098.797,Is that part of ways funded in the baseline budget.,24,,
134,0.97,1098.797,1103.001,I will let Jeff Simms answer that question.,25,,
135,0.97,1103.001,1106.238,Jeff Simms central staff.,26,,
136,0.97,1106.238,1121.019,"No, the base of the 2022 proposed budget does not provide a level of funding that would have met the level discussed in the recent response.",26,,
137,0.97,1121.019,1126.091,That was for analysis and budget estimate and estimate case load.,26,,
138,0.97,1126.091,1148.78,If lead was accepting all qualified referrals citywide and the 2022 proposed budget is essentially maintaining the funding last year with the inflationary increase and as I will discuss that is below the amount of funding that lead will be receiving in 2021.,26,,
139,0.97,1148.78,1149.147,Thank you.,27,,
140,0.97,1149.147,1156.154,I know we don't have a specific set of hands up right now but we will talk about lead here in a second.,27,,
141,0.97,1156.154,1161.226,So thank you for the reminder about that.,27,,
142,0.97,1161.226,1161.96,Okay.,27,,
143,0.97,1161.96,1164.096,Let's keep going.,27,,
144,0.97,1164.096,1164.396,Great.,28,,
145,0.97,1164.396,1165.063,"Next slide, please.",28,,
146,0.97,1165.063,1166.265,Patty.,28,,
147,0.97,1166.265,1172.204,So the first issue identified for your consideration is the community safety capacity building program.,28,,
148,0.97,1172.204,1180.479,As I mentioned this was originally funded with $12 million and one time funds in the 2020 adopted budget.,28,,
149,0.97,1180.479,1194.226,"1.6 million of the funding was for administration, community honor Yums and costs and the other 10.4 million was distributed to 33 organizations through an Rp process to fund community safety programs.",28,,
150,0.97,1194.226,1201.033,Because the funds for 2021 were contracted late in the year the contracts are through December of 2022.,28,,
151,0.97,1201.033,1216.715,And in addition as of a few weeks ago the 3 million in additional funding had not been contracted meaning 7 to 10 million of the 2021 funding will likely not be spent in 2021 and available to support the programs in 2022.,28,,
152,0.97,1216.715,1224.69,And I am Double-Checking with CBO to try and quantify that number exactly for you as we move through this process.,28,,
153,0.97,1224.69,1235.834,"In addition to the remaining 2021 funds, the proposed 2022 budget includes ongoing funding of 10 million per year for this program.",28,,
154,0.97,1235.834,1251.85,And similar to our discussion of Participatory budgeting this will lead to significant increase in funding in 2022 with the drop in 2023 without Council action.,28,,
155,0.97,1251.85,1275.24,Council can consider reducing fund for 22 to make funding for other priorities and minimize the funding cliff at the end of 22 when funding reduces to 10 million or the Council could choose to take no action.,28,,
156,0.97,1275.24,1278.343,Questions or comments on this?,29,,
157,0.97,1278.343,1278.877,Councilmember Herbold.,30,,
158,0.97,1278.877,1281.279,Please go ahead.,30,,
159,0.97,1281.279,1281.647,Thank you.,31,,
160,0.97,1281.647,1291.089,"This is now identified as an ongoing investment, is that correct?",31,,
161,0.97,1291.089,1291.356,Yes.,32,,
162,0.97,1291.356,1292.024,So that's good.,33,,
163,0.97,1292.024,1318.417,"We'll just start there because I think when we originally made it, it was considered one time funding and so this proposed budget adds another ten million and then there is the carry over for unspent dollars plus the other three that we put in just in September so you are saying that there is 17 there.",33,,
164,0.97,1318.417,1318.95,Right.,34,,
165,0.97,1318.95,1325.891,I am working to figure out what that exact number of carry forward is expected to be or what is available.,34,,
166,0.97,1325.891,1335.534,But right now I think it would be in that range.,34,,
167,0.97,1335.534,1358.924,"And so we reduce the funds to ten million, that would still carry us through the end of the contracts for the end of 2022 and considered ongoing assessment and there is money presumably available in 2022.",35,,
168,0.97,1358.924,1359.157,Yes.,36,,
169,0.97,1359.157,1366.331,There will be as long as no changes are made ten million available in 2023.,37,,
170,0.97,1366.331,1367.799,Is helpful.,38,,
171,0.97,1367.799,1383.548,"When I discussed this with director Nobel, he did kind of suggest that this was by design in an effort to try to assist us in turning a one-time investment.",38,,
172,0.97,1383.548,1388.253,I think I understand how that is working and appreciate the options here.,38,,
173,0.97,1388.253,1396.228,"Thank you Councilmember Herbold and I thank you, Amy for laying this out.",39,,
174,0.97,1396.228,1398.13,I too know that this came up.,39,,
175,0.97,1398.13,1417.582,We were told this summer we were told maybe you maybe you don't need to cut that three million that was not utilized because of officers not utilizing that funding.,39,,
176,0.97,1417.582,1438.603,We said it is important to use the $3 million and the community was asking for 3 million to the existing 10 million to contracts could be expended and Hsd could identify additional organizations to be grant recipients given there was $40 million and request that come in.,39,,
177,0.97,1438.603,1450.849,I think that important elements in your options here is similar to the conversations that we were having been the equitable community task force and the budgeting recommendations coming forward.,39,,
178,0.97,1450.849,1462.694,We don't want these programs to sort of how an amount in 2022 that is not reflective of where the funding will be in two or three years.,39,,
179,0.97,1462.694,1465.63,We don't want there to be a cliff for those funds to be pulled away.,39,,
180,0.97,1465.63,1471.136,And I am interested in working with you all and with central staff.,39,,
181,0.97,1471.136,1498.597,And with public safety and weighing into make sure that we do see the carry forward for the reference for 22 budget to commit to 13 million as the Council had authorized in making sure the three million does carry over to next year assuming Amy that your research that you are doing to figure out how much is potentially available is for 22.,39,,
182,0.97,1498.597,1508.707,I would love to see those dollars carry forward so we have maintained the program that we are adding additional contracts to it.,39,,
183,0.97,1508.707,1523.421,I do think that means that we are creating a reasonable sort of level expectation of how much people could receive versus an inflated amount that drops off without the ability for funding in the future.,39,,
184,0.97,1523.421,1535.567,I will look forward to working with you and I am leaning towards option a as well and wanted to make sure we are looking at out years and Sustainability.,39,,
185,0.97,1535.567,1540.305,Are there any additional questions or comments?,40,,
186,0.97,1540.305,1541.373,"Next slide, please.",40,,
187,0.97,1541.373,1541.74,Thank you.,40,,
188,0.97,1541.74,1550.515,I wanted to highlight the Seattle safety initiative funded with $4 million in one time funding in 2020.,40,,
189,0.97,1550.515,1564.396,The initiative funds for organizations to provide coordinated services including crisis intercept response and community safety hubs and neighborhood base safety teams to reduce violence and improve community safety.,40,,
190,0.97,1564.396,1573.705,The one time funding end at the end of 2021 and the 2022 proposed budget does not include funding for the program.,40,,
191,0.97,1573.705,1590.522,If Council wants this to phone number it could amend the proposed budget to include funding and that funding could be one time or ongoing.,40,,
192,0.97,1590.522,1593.191,Councilmember Herbold.,41,,
193,0.97,1593.191,1593.725,Thank you.,41,,
194,0.97,1593.725,1607.706,High priority for me and developed option one and thank you to those of you that have signed on in support of it.,42,,
195,0.97,1607.706,1617.282,This is an important geographically based model that is doing really amazing work in our communities.,42,,
196,0.97,1617.282,1626.658,Thank you very much Councilmember Herbold and appreciate your leadership and flagged as an area that did not get included and that others are interested in.,43,,
197,0.97,1626.658,1627.292,"Last slide, Amy.",44,,
198,0.97,1627.292,1632.063,The last slide will be discussed by Jeff Simms.,45,,
199,0.97,1632.063,1632.764,So thank you very much.,45,,
200,0.97,1632.764,1637.869,"Thank you Amy, thank you so much for being here.",46,,
201,0.97,1637.869,1638.37,"Welcome back, Jeff.",47,,
202,0.97,1638.37,1649.28,The last picture identification is the lead program that we already started touching to as a refresher for the 2021 budget.,48,,
203,0.97,1649.28,1649.781,Provided $6.1 million.,48,,
204,0.97,1649.781,1653.551,And over the course of 2021.,48,,
205,0.97,1653.551,1663.528,The Council added another $3 million in ordinance 126 is 48 for a total of $9.2 million being spent upon lead in 2021.,48,,
206,0.97,1663.528,1671.269,It is transparent that $3 million in September had the additional 3 million not provided to lead and so I don't know.,48,,
207,0.97,1671.269,1684.983,It was supposed to be completed and obviously those funds were not provided earlier and there is likely some impacts where things can occur.,48,,
208,0.97,1684.983,1695.26,The 2022 proposed budget maintains the adopted budget from last year with inflationary increase and does not add that $3 million that the Council appropriated in the last summer.,48,,
209,0.97,1695.26,1763.294,"As a result there is a funding decrease for lead relative to what was provided and then also to make sure I highlight per your question chairman Mosqueda there's two other options that go back to 2020 and in 2020 when the Council doubled funding for the lead program it passed a resolution seeking to resolve these to ensure appropriate funding would be available for all qualified referrals for 2023 and that resolution did not talk about city of Seattle everywhere funds but other pathways as well and then last year in the budget, the--last year as we were going through this, same process a slide was put together and like Hsd683 for anyone looking that up and it asked the human services Department to estimate the cost of doing citywide--the lead program citywide and accepting all appropriate qualifying referrals.",48,,
210,0.97,1763.294,1780.478,And that was just discussed at a council meeting or committee meeting I should say before the budget process began and the estimate for that amount is $21 million and so those of the various numbers to consider here and the options are to add more funding for the lead program or to go with the budget.,48,,
211,0.97,1780.478,1786.117,And the add funding for the leads program is the total of the 3 million.,49,,
212,0.97,1786.117,1788.92,That is up to the discretion of the Council.,50,,
213,0.97,1788.92,1808.006,"If you wanted to restore to the three million that wasn't--that was added over the summer it is not included and that can be one level and the desire to achieve some of the levels discussed either in the slide response or the resolution, that would be another one.",50,,
214,0.97,1808.006,1809.007,Remind me of that total.,51,,
215,0.97,1809.007,1813.111,I was getting lost in the numbers.,51,,
216,0.97,1813.111,1813.978,Is that the 21.,51,,
217,0.97,1813.978,1815.947,Yes.,52,,
218,0.97,1815.947,1818.917,21 million for the full sly implementation.,53,,
219,0.97,1818.917,1819.35,Yes.,54,,
220,0.97,1819.35,1832.964,And then another possibility because of the late date that $3 million would be provided it is not clear how much of the funds would be expended this year.,54,,
221,0.97,1832.964,1844.442,And if got awarded on December 25th I doubt many would be used so I don't know what is maintained relative to what we expand to once we receive that $3 million.,54,,
222,0.97,1844.442,1854.385,We would have to find out had the contract is awarded and engage with Hsd for further information.,54,,
223,0.97,1854.385,1855.22,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,55,,
224,0.97,1855.22,1855.62,Please go ahead.,55,,
225,0.97,1855.62,1916.547,I just want folks to know that because I feel really strongly that we passed this resolution a couple years ago and did the sly report and asked for the study and the analysts around what it would cost to take the program to scale I would Blake to start the conversation around that number but with a full understanding with so many competing needs we may not be able to get there but I think it is important to start the conversation about funding for lead within a context of Fidelity around the model and what we expected to accomplish and what a priority referral is versus what it should be.,56,,
226,0.97,1916.547,1942.807,And I think from my participation from the leads coordinating Council the thing that we struggle with is without full funding it creates a challenge around making decisions around who gets referrals to the program and not everybody who is eligible is able to be referred.,56,,
227,0.97,1942.807,1959.624,And so if we are not funding the program at full scale I think there is also an important policy conversation about how leads should be Prioritizing their referrals.,56,,
228,0.97,1959.624,1960.325,Great.,57,,
229,0.97,1960.325,1982.847,Thank you very much Councilmember Herbold for work on that and Jeff thank you for the reminders of the details in the slide and appreciate some of the importance of following through on what that slide was initially asking for what is full universe and how to take this to scale Councilmember Herbold your Audio is a little bit distant.,57,,
230,0.97,1982.847,1988.052,I don't know if there is a way to change the setting to individual.,57,,
231,0.97,1988.052,1995.626,I am not the Tech person but at some point we may want to Double-Check your Audio.,57,,
232,0.97,1995.626,1995.96,Great.,57,,
233,0.97,1995.96,1996.26,Thank you.,57,,
234,0.97,1996.26,2000.898,"So Jeff, thanks for getting us this last slide.",57,,
235,0.97,2000.898,2003.267,Colleagues are there any other questions in this category?,57,,
236,0.97,2003.267,2004.268,I am not hearing any.,57,,
237,0.97,2004.268,2012.543,This is a great Primer for the upcoming conversation here that we have on SPD for the remainder of the afternoon.,57,,
238,0.97,2012.543,2028.292,"I want to thank again Amy Gore and Lisa K and Ashtra and, of course, Patty and ally that are with us as well.",57,,
239,0.97,2028.292,2031.229,Great information leading into our conversation here.,57,,
240,0.97,2031.229,2033.831,Also made cameos and thanks for being with us.,57,,
241,0.97,2033.831,2038.77,Madam clerk can you please read item 3 in the record.,57,,
242,0.97,2038.77,2046.177,Seattle police Department for briefing and discussion.,58,,
243,0.97,2046.177,2051.182,Wonderful.,59,,
244,0.97,2051.182,2061.659,Thank you and welcome Greg.,59,,
245,0.97,2085.516,2086.017,I appreciate your patience.,59,,
246,0.97,2086.017,2087.085,Councilmember Herbold will be a long presentation.,59,,
247,0.97,2087.085,2087.685,Did you have anything to say?,59,,
248,0.97,2087.685,2087.952,Nothing.,59,,
249,0.97,2087.952,2088.419,We will get into it.,59,,
250,0.97,2088.419,2089.02,Thanks for getting us going.,59,,
251,0.97,2089.02,2089.387,Thanks you.,60,,
252,0.97,2089.387,2092.723,Last but not least the Seattle police Department is going to try to move through it as quickly as I can and as you posted out it is longish and dive in Patty.,60,,
253,0.97,2092.723,2102.867,This is not easy to read but I will point out there is not a lot of information that can be taken away here at a very high level what you are seeing is a budget that has not changed a lot.,60,,
254,0.97,2102.867,2132.396,At the bottom line a budget that has moved up in appropriation over Two-And-A- half million and that has grown by only less than one percent and it is the case that Ftes have gone from 2020 to 1769 largely because of the Ftes that have moved out of the police Department and the parking enforcement unit and the communications group over the last year.,60,,
255,0.97,2132.396,2170.968,"I know that there has been some question about the Ftes and the number that was in the printed budget, the proposed budget that the Mayor sent down and I can let members know that 1769 number that is small there in the 2022 proposed column is a number that CPO has put forward to me and it is three ft higher than the one in the printed budget so slightly off but certainly not anything that is of concern.",60,,
256,0.97,2170.968,2191.556,The percentage change column in the Bsls are largely do to money moving around and having to do with salary savings that are being put in a place that Hsd would like to spend them and that will pretty much be the entire topic of our conversation this afternoon.,60,,
257,0.97,2191.556,2198.262,"And with that, if it is okay I will just move along.",60,,
258,0.97,2198.262,2214.812,And so I wouldn't normally start with staffing I would normally go to the Mayor's proposed budget ad but in this particular case starting with staffing is good context one subject very much ties into the others.,60,,
259,0.97,2214.812,2216.514,Hopefully that is okay.,60,,
260,0.97,2216.514,2230.628,I will start with staffing and as you'll see here in the staffing chart of course there is the history of investing in Spds funded Ftes and that column that is second from the left.,60,,
261,0.97,2230.628,2253.918,And the city has continually put more money into the Department in the last decade and move that funded FTE number up and that continued until last year last summer specifically when SPD reduced its internal allocating for funded FTE from 1497 to 1422.,60,,
262,0.97,2253.918,2288.753,"And as you all know that happened and immediately following was a five month hiring freeze and this handed because there was the Covid crisis and also there was a need for SPD to capture savings because of expenditures made in the overtime category to address George Floyd and black lives matter demonstrations and so for those reasons, SPD lowered its own funded FTE count to capture savings.",60,,
263,0.97,2288.753,2315.579,"And then in the 2021 adopted budget, that next line down you can see the Council funded the FTE at 1343 largely to reflect what the trend was at the time of unprecedented number of officer separations and the Council was starting to see in the fall and expected to continue throughout the year.",60,,
264,0.97,2315.579,2332.997,As the line is ending in the net ads column negative 78 in 2021 and negative 35 in 120 means by the end of 2021 there is a projected Net loss of 215 officers.,60,,
265,0.97,2332.997,2333.364,From the force.,60,,
266,0.97,2333.364,2345.376,And the Department has indicated that about a third of those officers had fewer than seven years of service and about 25% were people of color.,60,,
267,0.97,2345.376,2350.514,And so now jump into the Mayor's proposed budget.,60,,
268,0.97,2350.514,2356.954,", Oh, if you could flip back one more I wasn't done with that.",60,,
269,0.97,2356.954,2357.355,"Thanks, Patty.",60,,
270,0.97,2357.355,2364.862,The Mayor's proposed budget would increase sworn staffing to a level that would support 1357Ftes and that's the 2022 row.,60,,
271,0.97,2364.862,2370.401,That is there on the Veried end of the table.,60,,
272,0.97,2370.401,2387.885,And obviously this is increase from last year and executive has said that the reason that they are increasing the sworn FTE is for a couple of reasons.,60,,
273,0.97,2387.885,2402.199,First because 1357 is the number of authorized positions that the defendant currently has and the Council last year cut a number of positions 97 I believe.,60,,
274,0.97,2402.199,2426.657,And cut the authorized positions down to 1357 and one reason why the executive has picked that number and funding up to the authorized level and the second is that the executive believes that the Council took the action of going down to 1343 only to capture attrition savings that was expected in the fall.,60,,
275,0.97,2426.657,2436.233,"And since they believe that attrition will stop this year, they have moved the funding level back up to 1357.",60,,
276,0.97,2436.233,2460.524,And so going to the specifics what that would mean is that their staffing plan would hire 125 new hires and they would expect 94 separations that is a drastic difference since the last couple of years.,60,,
277,0.97,2460.524,2476.774,And the Mayor's plan has been publicized as hiring a net of 35 sworn officers and I should point out that she gets there by not including Academy separations.,60,,
278,0.97,2476.774,2490.12,"When a recruit--it is a technical thing, when a recruit is hired, their civilian and go through the Academy as a civilian and not until they graduate from the Academy that they take the sworn oath.",60,,
279,0.97,2490.12,2496.16,If they drop out from the Academy they are dropping Ou as civilian.,60,,
280,0.97,2496.16,2501.899,She is not counting for Academy drop outs as sworn officers separations.,60,,
281,0.97,2501.899,2512.81,"And by doing that, she is taking 125 less 90 and instead of less 94 and calling it 35 sworn ads.",60,,
282,0.97,2512.81,2518.716,And so that is how she has 35 sworn ads in her promotional material.,60,,
283,0.97,2518.716,2524.722,But actually if you just take the total ads less the total separations it is 31.,60,,
284,0.97,2524.722,2529.894,Which would be the case over two years.,60,,
285,0.97,2529.894,2532.663,I will make that distinction so there is no confusion.,60,,
286,0.97,2532.663,2554.818,But she would get through that the 94 separations and 125 ads and the 125 ads would consist of 105 recruits and 20 lateral hires and I think it is evident from this table that is not a level that SPD has seen a whole lot.,60,,
287,0.97,2554.818,2557.655,It is an aggressive staffing plan.,60,,
288,0.97,2557.655,2561.926,And it isn't something that is in it that couldn't be achieved but it is certainly aggressive.,60,,
289,0.97,2561.926,2572.036,It is something that the Department believes that they can reach because of a number of changes that they have made.,60,,
290,0.97,2572.036,2600.264,One of the changes being that they have put their testing system Online and makes it easier for folks to take the test and more significant claim they have contracted out for the background services and there used to be bottle neck as folks passed the test and moved to Backgrounding it would take several months for the background detectives to get them through the full investigation process.,60,,
291,0.97,2600.264,2604.702,Now that they have help doing that hopefully they can get them through quicker.,60,,
292,0.97,2604.702,2617.781,With those two assumptions they are think that they will get through 125 hires with 105 recruits and 20 Laterals.,60,,
293,0.97,2617.781,2619.216,Again aggressive as they have acknowledged.,60,,
294,0.97,2619.216,2648.312,"And the last thing I will say about this slide before I take some questions, I know you will have some questions is that Ifny achieve this plan they will need funding to support the Ftes and so 1223Ftes is quite a bit less than what they are funded at.",60,,
295,0.97,2648.312,2650.581,They are funded at 1357.,60,,
296,0.97,2650.581,2654.918,So it is a difference of is 34.,60,,
297,0.97,2654.918,2661.425,They will have 134Ftes that are funded and vacant and creating salary savings.,60,,
298,0.97,2661.425,2668.198,And that salary savings will add up to $19 million.,60,,
299,0.97,2668.198,2677.841,And then what their budget is based on is taking the $19 million of salary Savings and then spending it elsewhere.,60,,
300,0.97,2677.841,2692.756,I am about to in a minute when I go to your questions and how they spend that salary Savings and a specific plan to spend 17.9 million of it that will go to a minute.,60,,
301,0.97,2692.756,2698.495,And I have thrown out and stopped and I will take a break for questions.,60,,
302,0.97,2698.495,2702.966,"Greg, thank you very much.",61,,
303,0.97,2702.966,2705.035,"Colleagues, are there questions at this point.",61,,
304,0.97,2705.035,2735.065,I will Jugs ask if you are able to give us a sense of how this hiring plan is compared to last year when we received a budget with aggressive hiring plan and ultimately we understood that there was really not a way to hit that higher and we made appropriate changes to reflect what was achievable.,61,,
305,0.97,2735.065,2743.14,Is there any way to compare this level of aggressive Hireing to what we saw in last year's proposed budget?,61,,
306,0.97,2743.14,2743.841,Yes.,62,,
307,0.97,2743.841,2752.082,"In last year's proposed budget Madam chair, they had proposed 114 hires.",62,,
308,0.97,2752.082,2762.693,And I don't remember the specific break out of recruits versus Laterals.,62,,
309,0.97,2762.693,2767.898,I think it was I'm not going to say because I don't remember.,62,,
310,0.97,2767.898,2771.335,But it was less aggressive.,62,,
311,0.97,2771.335,2775.506,114 versus 125.,62,,
312,0.97,2775.506,3040.637,And so far this this is trained officers in service and fully trained officers are officers that have been through--they have obviously been through the Academy.,62,,
313,0.97,3040.637,3048.712,They have been through field training and you can put them in a squad car and they will respond to a 911 call.,62,,
314,0.97,3048.712,3054.818,An officer in service is available and showing up to work every day.,62,,
315,0.97,3054.818,3078.809,"The officer in service number, the gray number that is lower accounts for officers that are out on long term disability leave or on other kinds of leave like family leave and so you have a higher number of officers that you take out of folks that are on long term leave and you have a lower number of officers and it is the lower number that you can actually put out in the field every day.",62,,
316,0.97,3078.809,3105.769,And you will see that there is--that as you have seen in the past those two numbers track somewhat close to each other and then during the summer of 2020 they Diverge quite a bit and over the incomes next couple of years they will go back to historic patterns and fewer folks on extended leave.,62,,
317,0.97,3105.769,3147.043,"To give you an idea of how the consecutive ads of back to back 31 NET new hires will look over two years, it will start to change the curve a little bit back towards where the officers were, not regaining too much, certainly not back up to the levels between 2017 and on STAF I will show you is a patrol staffing changes.",62,,
318,0.97,3147.043,3151.348,"What I want to show you here, I know this is not a very easy one to read.",62,,
319,0.97,3151.348,3166.663,"You see on the left is patrol staffing as it exists today, and describing this particular table, you see the various kinds of patrol staffing, the very top row is the 911 responders.",62,,
320,0.97,3166.663,3182.779,"Then you have other kinds of specialty patrol staffing, the Anticrime teams, bike and foot beats, the community police teams and then some other specialty patrol staff positions.",62,,
321,0.97,3182.779,3190.587,"The same thing in the table on the right, the table on the right is from a year ago.",62,,
322,0.97,3190.587,3199.896,"And so, what you can see here is that there is a drastic change over the last year as the staffing has changed at SPD.",62,,
323,0.97,3199.896,3216.88,"The specialty staffing that was primarily in the community police team or the Anticrime team or on the beats, those officers, as officers, have been pushed into patrol.",62,,
324,0.97,3216.88,3230.627,"And that is what chief Diaz has done over the last year, to try to maintain response times and to avoid priority call response days.",62,,
325,0.97,3230.627,3237.267,"When they moved into patrol, they did not move back into the precinct, North, South, East and West, directly.",62,,
326,0.97,3237.267,3245.742,They moved into a section that was called citywide response.,62,,
327,0.97,3245.742,3268.064,"So if you look at the table on the left, you will see a new column called citywide response, and that is all of those officers that had been doing the specialty work, that had not been answering 911 calls, now they are answering 911 calls again and they are part of this specialty unit citywide response that is assisting with 911 calls.",62,,
328,0.97,3268.064,3270.1,And so the city is handling 911 calls very differently.,62,,
329,0.97,3270.1,3289.452,"But I think the thing to point out is that if you take the numbers of nine on one responders, they have not changed, you are seeing 564 911 responders this year and 563 911 responders last year.",62,,
330,0.97,3289.452,3294.791,"So, the responders, the staffing, has not changed.",62,,
331,0.97,3294.791,3305.802,"What is different is the way they are being managed and the way they are responding to calls, and what of course we are seeing is increases in 911 response times and increases in priority call response dates.",62,,
332,0.97,3305.802,3310.807,"And so I asked the Department, I said how do those things go together?",62,,
333,0.97,3310.807,3339.536,"And what they told me was that since the reopening of the city, since folks started to go back to work and even started happening again, there has been more traffic congestion and that has led to a decrease, or an increase, and call response times, as well as more of an Uptick in call volume.",62,,
334,0.97,3339.536,3359.723,"And then second, that there is an Uptick in shots fired and in emergency incidents, and that when there are emergency incidents, that citywide response team and patrol folks go to those emergency incidents and of course when that happens they become unavailable for calls.",62,,
335,0.97,3359.723,3361.024,"And then Lastly, the staffing shortage.",62,,
336,0.97,3361.024,3369.365,And that is the piece that is still a bit of a Disconnect.,62,,
337,0.97,3369.365,3373.369,So that is something I am still working on learning more about.,62,,
338,0.97,3373.369,3376.84,We appreciate you doing this digging.,63,,
339,0.97,3376.84,3379.275,"Councilmember Herbal, please go ahead.",63,,
340,0.97,3379.275,3390.553,"I was going to underscore some of what Greg just covered but he did such a great job, I don't know what there is left for me to say.",64,,
341,0.97,3390.553,3406.002,"Other than just again, noting that we have virtually the same number of 911 responders in patrol and response times going up.",64,,
342,0.97,3406.002,3419.516,And the narrative that we are hearing a lot is the reason why response times going up is because of staffing shortage.,64,,
343,0.97,3419.516,3421.518,"So, there is something more going on here.",64,,
344,0.97,3421.518,3430.693,I understand that some of it is about how folks in patrol are being managed.,64,,
345,0.97,3430.693,3478.775,"As far as in the Cru unit as opposed to being dispatched out of Precinct, there are still Precinct-Based officers, but the Cru unit is 100 officers, so that means, as I understand, I think what SPD is saying as it relates to traffic and congestion and opening up the city is, when the Cru unit is dispatched to a priority one call, they might be traveling a further distance, and so traffic impacts are more likely to slow them down than if they are traveling within a precinct.",64,,
346,0.97,3478.775,3480.043,To another location.,64,,
347,0.97,3480.043,3483.079,In a precinct.,64,,
348,0.97,3483.079,3495.291,"But, you know, it is very interesting to see it, you know, laid out this way.",64,,
349,0.97,3495.291,3507.904,"We had, about a year ago, had a similar conversation around the numbers of patrol staffing, so it is really good to get this data here.",64,,
350,0.97,3507.904,3529.993,"I think the one thing I would ask Greg is, about the, you know, they have given a couple of different reasons for why it is that response times are up for priority one calls, that is where my mind is focused, at least.",64,,
351,0.97,3529.993,3532.929,In addition to traffic and congestion.,64,,
352,0.97,3532.929,3542.238,They reference increased calls and increased shots fired.,64,,
353,0.97,3542.238,3559.756,"Anecdotally and by the data, we know there is definitely an increase in shots fired . I would be interested to know whether or not we are checking the increase in calls generally.",64,,
354,0.97,3559.756,3573.369,"And specifically for priority one calls, since we do have a metric that we try to meet for priority one calls,",64,,
355,0.97,3573.369,3575.572,I will check on that and get back to you.,65,,
356,0.97,3575.572,3589.886,"To your point, Councilmember, I did learn today that the community response group is, they report to the precinct, they do also do cross beat dispatching, so there is some of that going on.",65,,
357,0.97,3589.886,3601.798,"So there is, Yeah, there is potentially some traffic issues there as the Department has suggested.",65,,
358,0.97,3601.798,3605.501,And we will look into the call volume issue as well.,65,,
359,0.97,3605.501,3608.771,"Thank you, Greg.",66,,
360,0.97,3608.771,3621.851,"Greg and Councilmember Herbold, thank you for hoping to draw out the conclusion here in terms of, as you put it, there must be something else going on.",67,,
361,0.97,3621.851,3654.851,"And I would be interested in hearing more at some point, perhaps maybe over the next week or two about what that management issue is, in addition to the traffic and distance you all mentioned and if you have any other thoughts about that as well, I think it is an important take away from this slide as you noted, relatively the same numbers of calls, obviously different ways in which people are being deployed, but not a stark difference once you do--once you take into consideration how many folks are on leave and available at the time.",67,,
362,0.97,3654.851,3660.356,"Councilmember Alex Peterson, please go ahead.",67,,
363,0.97,3660.356,3667.163,"I come I wanted to ask about the Cpt, is that community policing team?",68,,
364,0.97,3667.163,3667.563,Yes.,69,,
365,0.97,3667.563,3691.587,"So, when we look at last year having 28 and then this year having zero, I know that in our district we really Miss our community policing officers, they were out there during the day trying to look at the data, trying to work with detectives to solve crimes, to work with patrol.",70,,
366,0.97,3691.587,3695.692,They know the community very well.,70,,
367,0.97,3695.692,3701.998,So we look forward to the day when we can return the community policing officers to their positions.,70,,
368,0.97,3701.998,3706.969,"Where is the, something like harbor patrol?",70,,
369,0.97,3706.969,3717.013,Another has been a concern that harbor patrol is not as well staffed because some of them have been pulled over to regular patrol.,70,,
370,0.97,3717.013,3721.784,Is harbor patrol on this list?,70,,
371,0.97,3721.784,3723.82,"Harbor patrol is not on this list, Councilmember.",71,,
372,0.97,3723.82,3746.042,"There are, in the Appendices in my issue paper, you will see a general breakout of Department functions and you will see that there is a specialty unit function outside of patrol . and that would be the category that harbor patrol would fall in.",71,,
373,0.97,3746.042,3749.345,And you will see that is down quite a bit.,71,,
374,0.97,3749.345,3752.215,I would have to go grab my issue paper to see how much --,71,,
375,0.97,3752.215,3753.049,That is okay.,72,,
376,0.97,3753.049,3754.817,That is okay.,72,,
377,0.97,3754.817,3758.821,"Harbor patrol, I believe it is down 40%.",73,,
378,0.97,3758.821,3763.326,From where it was.,73,,
379,0.97,3763.326,3771.467,"For the most part, the folks that went into patrol were coming from--went into 911 response, were coming from patrol.",73,,
380,0.97,3771.467,3776.672,"Those act Cpt, those folks.",73,,
381,0.97,3776.672,3778.341,"They were not from harbor patrol, per se.",73,,
382,0.97,3778.341,3786.782,"Most of those specialty unit, the reason most of them are down are because of attrition.",73,,
383,0.97,3786.782,3792.155,Because of officers leaving.,73,,
384,0.97,3792.155,3800.163,"That is not entirely true, some of those folks did move into 911 response, but for the most part, it is, this Erg is made up of the numbers you can see there in the table to the right.",73,,
385,0.97,3800.163,3815.611,"And so, when we are looking at the change in the numbers from the grand total, 677, dropping down to 579, we are seeing community policing officers being moved over to Reactive patrol position.",74,,
386,0.97,3815.611,3828.624,Could you talk about beets already? and what their role is typically and they have been rolled into patrol now too?,74,,
387,0.97,3828.624,3836.199,"I did not talk about it too much, but that represents the downtown bike and foot beats and there were some in the North precinct.",75,,
388,0.97,3836.199,3839.902,And obviously they have gone down quite a bit.,75,,
389,0.97,3839.902,3843.239,"I believe, and they are only in West at this point.",75,,
390,0.97,3843.239,3855.151,"And the last question here, there are also detectives that I understand have the Department who investigate murders and other violent crimes.",76,,
391,0.97,3855.151,3860.456,Are the detectives in this chart or are they in a different chart?,76,,
392,0.97,3860.456,3866.662,The detectives would be in that Appendices that I was kind of mentioning.,77,,
393,0.97,3866.662,3870.233,Let me jump Online and look at it here.,77,,
394,0.97,3870.233,3893.789,"The criminal investigations section of the Department is down by--investigate of units went from 16.2% of the Non- patrol personnel, down to 14.4% in 2021.",77,,
395,0.97,3893.789,3903.399,"Specialty units were at about 9% of the Department last year, and they have gone down to 3% of the Department this year.",77,,
396,0.97,3903.399,3913.676,"So, I think this is consistent with what we know of how the chief Prioritizes patrolling 911 over specialty units.",77,,
397,0.97,3913.676,3917.213,Thank you.,78,,
398,0.97,3917.213,3919.882,"Thanks a lot, thank you Councilmember Pedersen.",79,,
399,0.97,3919.882,3922.218,Councilmember Lewis.,79,,
400,0.97,3922.218,3923.219,"Thank you, Madam chair.",80,,
401,0.97,3923.219,3926.389,"I want to go back to harbor patrol just for a second, Greg.",80,,
402,0.97,3926.389,3939.435,"So, I think a lot of us on the Council, you know Councilmember Strauss has been a really big leader at looking into ways we can possibly do some of the harbor patrol functions differently.",80,,
403,0.97,3939.435,3956.319,"I feel like we are going to chronically be in a position as there are staffing Crunches at the police Department, where harbor patrol will continue to be less of a deployment priority.",80,,
404,0.97,3956.319,3972.868,"And to my understanding, as we have learned several times over the last several months, and over the last year, these deployment decisions are at the discretion of the chief per the charter.",80,,
405,0.97,3972.868,3981.077,"So, we don't really have the ability to selectively staff some of these units.",80,,
406,0.97,3981.077,4025.821,"Because there is a big need with harbor patrol and because harbor patrol has experienced so much attrition, and because my understanding is, the functions of harbor patrol are very different from all of the other duties of the Department, is there a potential way to pursue funding, restoration, and Enhancement of the harbor patrol capacity through some alternative type of worker, so that we don't have to be in a position where the chief has to make those decisions to staff up the harbor patrol at the expense of some of these other functions?",80,,
407,0.97,4025.821,4038.434,"Or are we kind of stuck in this space where that is going to have to basically stay as a sworn function, and are there some critical components requiring it to be a sworn function that I am not aware of?",80,,
408,0.97,4038.434,4041.937,Just wanted to throw those out there at this early stage.,80,,
409,0.97,4041.937,4046.342,"Thank you, Councilmember.",81,,
410,0.97,4046.342,4064.427,"I think there are obviously some enforcement components the harbor patrol has that would have to remain under the Purview of a sworn officer, so you obviously need to have a sworn officer, giving somebody a boating Dui or something that is involved with any sort of criminal aspect.",81,,
411,0.97,4064.427,4073.502,"With regard to what harbor patrol does on the civil side or just on the safety side, the challenge there gets to be labor.",81,,
412,0.97,4073.502,4102.498,"And it has to do with a body of work that is currently being done by sworn officers as part of the Seattle police officers killed, and if the Seattle police officers killed wanted to give up that bounty of work and allow for that body of work to be done by civilians, then that is something that could happen, but that is something that currently is done by harbor patrol and that is something that they have a right to retain.",81,,
413,0.97,4102.498,4106.602,"So, it is something that the city would need to negotiate, to have civilians do.",81,,
414,0.97,4106.602,4116.112,"That is probably not something that can happen in the short term, but it is something that the city could pursue.",81,,
415,0.97,4116.112,4118.614,Councilmember Strauss.,82,,
416,0.97,4118.614,4124.787,"Thank you, chair, and thank you, Greg.",83,,
417,0.97,4124.787,4127.423,I just wanted to Re-Something you had mentioned about attrition with harbor patrol.,83,,
418,0.97,4127.423,4135.931,It is my understanding that harbor patrol has retained all of the Ftes Pre-2020 as they do today.,83,,
419,0.97,4135.931,4158.32,"The reason there are fewer staff at harbor patrol today is because the officers on long- term leave, which indicated on a few slides previous, are being placed in harbor patrol, meaning that there are fewer deployable officers, yet the number of total officers has still been retained within harbor patrol.",83,,
420,0.97,4158.32,4168.43,"Is that--may be to put it more simply, we still have the same number of officers at harbor patrol as we have had for the last number of years.",83,,
421,0.97,4168.43,4171.667,The difference today as compared to before is that those officers are on long-term leave.,83,,
422,0.97,4171.667,4174.37,Is that a correct understanding?,83,,
423,0.97,4174.37,4180.576,"There were a number of officers, it is my understanding, that were in the harbor patrol that went out on long-term leave.",84,,
424,0.97,4180.576,4191.754,If you are saying that officers in other areas of the Department went out on long- term leave and then those slots got assigned or those vacancies got assigned to harbor?,84,,
425,0.97,4191.754,4195.057,I do not know that that is the case.,84,,
426,0.97,4195.057,4197.193,The latter is not what I was indicating.,85,,
427,0.97,4197.193,4206.802,"The former is--that we have not change the FTE funding for harbor patrol, it is that those officers are on long-term leave.",85,,
428,0.97,4206.802,4218.414,"Into Councilmember Lewis' point, there is no way we as city Councilmembers can mandate officers being in harbor patrol, as a pet compared to another beat.",85,,
429,0.97,4218.414,4225.621,"That is the discretion of the chief, is that correct?",85,,
430,0.97,4225.621,4226.488,Bee that is correct.,85,,
431,0.97,4226.488,4233.429,"I think those officers started out, a lot of them started out on long-term leave and have since separated.",85,,
432,0.97,4233.429,4241.537,"So I don't know that currently today you would see that a lot of them are on long-term leave, I think you would see a lot of vacancy, actual vacancies, if I remember, when I last looked at the data.",85,,
433,0.97,4241.537,4242.304,Thank you.,86,,
434,0.97,4242.304,4252.948,"And then to kind of frame Councilmember Lewis' question a little more, in a more focused way, I think the question was, is there a way for us to have Non-Sworn officers on boats?",86,,
435,0.97,4252.948,4268.597,"And the answer that I heard, similar to a close community service officer, a CSO on a boat, and from what I hear is I cannot occur without spot agreeing to it, is that correct?",86,,
436,0.97,4268.597,4273.969,"I believe that is the case, you would want to get the law Department to tell you that definitively.",87,,
437,0.97,4273.969,4284.179,"And that is a question central staff is pursuing with the law Department and will brief you on, but that is certainly something that central staff has worked with the law apartment in the past and that is what we have heard.",87,,
438,0.97,4284.179,4284.847,Thank you.,88,,
439,0.97,4284.847,4314.643,"And, you know, just the uniqueness of Seattle with all of our waterways, both for pleasure and for economic uses, what I have noticed in this investigation of what is proper staffing, we do not have a nationally certified organization telling us what the proper staffing of our waterways is at this time, so colleagues, I will flag for you, I will be requesting in this budget, a third-party study.",88,,
440,0.97,4314.643,4325.154,"Whether it is Nick Jr. or another nationally certified institution, to tell us what the proper staffing level is for our waterways, and that is both with police and Nonpolice responses.",88,,
441,0.97,4325.154,4328.724,So that will inform our decisions moving forward.,88,,
442,0.97,4328.724,4329.792,Thank you.,89,,
443,0.97,4329.792,4342.638,"Thank you Councilmember Strauss, Councilmember Herbold, before you turn it over to you, a question on harbor patrol or another subject?",90,,
444,0.97,4342.638,4345.541,I will hold my question as well and I will let you go first.,90,,
445,0.97,4345.541,4346.141,Thanks.,91,,
446,0.97,4346.141,4380.275,"In this question of body of work, for harbor patrol, I just want to highlight, perhaps an easier path, not saying that it would not still need to be bargained, but perhaps an easier path might be the existing Mo you with the fire Department, because there is an existing Mou between fire and SPD for that shared body of work.",91,,
447,0.97,4380.275,4410.806,"So rather than the complexity of adding a different--a need for negotiation with a different worker, I have been encouraging people who have been reaching out to me about this issue, I have been sharing with folks the slide report that Councilmember Strauss sponsored last year, and I have been urging folks to consider calling for a reopening of that Mou.",91,,
448,0.97,4410.806,4474.269,"All parties have to agree, but I feel like the fact that there is an existing Mou, there is more potential there to get fire and spoke to agree to Revisit that, because again it is an existing agreement rather than having a conversation with a whole other type of worker about that same body of work, and then the other point I want to make about this issue generally, and our interest in having Non-Sworn officers do some of the functions that historically sworn officers have done, totally understand the law Department's advice to us, and we have recognized it in our own legislation in the past, when we have made changes to the police Department's budget, we call out the fact that we recognize something needs to be bargained.",91,,
449,0.97,4474.269,4485.747,Many of the priorities in last year's budget recognized that the things we wanted to do may need to be bargained.,91,,
450,0.97,4485.747,4490.352,"I do have interest in exploring whether or not we are in a different place right now, though.",91,,
451,0.97,4490.352,4495.457,Because of the staffing reductions.,91,,
452,0.97,4495.457,4529.291,"And whether or not there are extenuating circumstances that management, because of our obligation to make sure that we do have officers who are responding to 911 calls and doing their basic law enforcement mission, whether or not that might create a different legal framework as it relates to our obligation to bargain having other people do things that police officers do not have to do.",91,,
453,0.97,4529.291,4545.707,"I feel like we are again, in a different place and that isn't just an issue about body of work, this is about our inability to get the work done without this conversation.",91,,
454,0.97,4545.707,4552.08,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Herbold.",92,,
455,0.97,4552.08,4559.454,"Actually, that was very much in line with what I was going to ask about or mention as well, so I look forward to working with you and hearing more from you, Greg, about this.",92,,
456,0.97,4559.454,4566.929,"I know we need to move on, we have about eight more slides to go and we have about an hour and a half Bracketed for the rest of this conversation.",92,,
457,0.97,4566.929,4598.594,"I will note for the community, the conversations we have had over the conversations with labor and folks are concerned about public safety, making sure that the health and safety of those who are on our waterways is maintained and that we have emergency responses for folks who might be in trouble on our waterways, given the high number of people that are moving here, that maybe aren't as familiar with the temperatures on our water and how quickly 70 can experience Hypothermia, both in the sound and in the Lakes.",92,,
458,0.97,4598.594,4625.287,"I know this health and safety element is something I'm very interested in and as Councilmember Herbold noted, there is an interesting nexus with the existing Mou at Seattle fire Department and the ability for us to maintain a health and safety presence on the waterways and look forward to talking with you more, Greg, about the requirements we know also exist at the state level regarding to the issue of the ability to issue citations.",92,,
459,0.97,4625.287,4629.858,But just flagging an area of more conversations to come.,92,,
460,0.97,4629.858,4636.465,Councilmember Alice.,92,,
461,0.97,4636.465,4658.453,"Our office has been working quickly with central staff, with Dnr and with all of our departments around, particularly around the Bay but also with respect to what we can do to ensure water safety, and also have been talking to Councilmember Strauss.",93,,
462,0.97,4658.453,4661.056,There will be more to come.,93,,
463,0.97,4661.056,4662.057,Excellent.,94,,
464,0.97,4662.057,4669.064,"Okay, Greg, shall we move on to slide number five?",94,,
465,0.97,4669.064,4669.931,Anything else on this?,94,,
466,0.97,4669.931,4673.235,"I will say, I will follow up with the Council on this.",95,,
467,0.97,4673.235,4677.539,I will get in touch with the Department and ask for more information.,95,,
468,0.97,4677.539,4688.684,"It may be as simple as something as there are with the staffing problems, people calling in sick and there is not enough people to cover.",95,,
469,0.97,4688.684,4693.855,Although that is a situation that would not have been any different last year.,95,,
470,0.97,4693.855,4701.697,"So, because they generally use overtime to fill those slots.",95,,
471,0.97,4701.697,4708.703,So I will follow-up.,95,,
472,0.97,4708.703,4710.505,It is information that I will get to you.,95,,
473,0.97,4710.505,4714.209,"And then, I am ready to move on.",95,,
474,0.97,4714.209,4716.211,"Thank you very much, Greg.",96,,
475,0.97,4716.211,4725.787,"Okay, so how are they going to use all the salary savings?",97,,
476,0.97,4725.787,4729.691,"I have prepared a table that is three slides long, it is a table that you have seen before.",97,,
477,0.97,4729.691,4738.567,And it is a table that contains a number of items you saw as you are viewing the midyear supplemental.,97,,
478,0.97,4738.567,4749.611,Many of the items the Department spent its salary savings on in the midyear supplemental this year are items that are continuing in 2021 and are also drawing salary savings.,97,,
479,0.97,4749.611,4759.254,I have put those items into buckets so that they are more easily digested and we can go over them a little quicker.,97,,
480,0.97,4759.254,4767.262,"And so, what you see before you, the first table shows one of the items at the top.",97,,
481,0.97,4767.262,4773.702,You see the Nick Jr. contract you're familiar with that we have been talking about extensively today.,97,,
482,0.97,4773.702,4788.283,"And the CSC, dispatch protocol system Councilmember Herbold has been talking about, both of those were distinct one-time studies that are funded and so there is no need for them in the 2022 proposed study.",97,,
483,0.97,4788.283,4788.717,Or proposed budget.,97,,
484,0.97,4788.717,4811.206,"The same is true of the Hst community safety capacity building ad that you talked about, Councilmember Mosqueda, just about an hour ago, that was and is one-time cut from the SPD in the 2021 budget and that is not a cut that is being made in the Mayor's proposed budget.",97,,
485,0.97,4811.206,4818.814,"So that would move us to the next bucket, which is the technical adjustments, I am calling them technical adjustments.",97,,
486,0.97,4818.814,4839.935,"You have seen before that there is a need to dedicate some salary savings to a separation pay as more officers have been leaving, there is a need to fund vacation and other costs that are associated with officers leaving.",97,,
487,0.97,4839.935,4846.541,"That is again, funded with salary savings as it is a deferred compensation shortfall that we saw in 2021.",97,,
488,0.97,4846.541,4874.436,"Paid parental leave is an item that is in 2021, funded in two ways, there is a $1.8 million withholding in finance general that the city budget office will ask if SPD can accept in the year and supplemental, and then SPD is holding as part of its salary savings, another 200,000.",97,,
489,0.97,4874.436,4878.473,Those two items together add up to $2 million.,97,,
490,0.97,4878.473,4887.882,"To make things simpler, next year, the budget office just took that $2 million and moved it into SPD's face budget.",97,,
491,0.97,4887.882,4896.558,So they did that by making you some salary savings in the 2022 base budget.,97,,
492,0.97,4896.558,4943.405,"One of the things important to know about this as well as many of the items you will see in this table is that what is happening is you are seeing a use of salary savings for ongoing items as as officer start to return to the Department, as if the Department does increase in size, and if the Council does invest in officers say up to the 1537 level, then it would be a situation where money would eventually need to be added because the money that is right now in salary savings is going toward ongoing items like paid parental leave.",97,,
493,0.97,4943.405,4959.754,The event overtime item that was funded in the 2021 midyear supplemental budget in the proposed budget is actually fully restored to 6.4 million.,97,,
494,0.97,4959.754,4962.824,"Patty, would you go ahead and flip to the next slide?",97,,
495,0.97,4962.824,4998.793,"And then, these next items are items that are again, what I would call sort of ongoing items that are items that were in the midyear budget that are continuing, the civilian personal cost positions that were added in the 2021 budget, and some positions that were in the 2021 budget that were not funded, due to the Covid crisis, SPD is using their salary savings in this year to fund and next year would as well.",97,,
496,0.97,4998.793,5006.801,"Same with the mental health professional contract background services, we talked a little bit about.",97,,
497,0.97,5006.801,5017.078,"You have heard today about regional community safety plan and the Peacekeepers collective, and you have also heard about triage one.",97,,
498,0.97,5017.078,5023.485,These items are cuts to the SPD budget.,97,,
499,0.97,5023.485,5025.72,And then SPD is using salary savings to Backfill those cuts.,97,,
500,0.97,5025.72,5027.055,So that they can continue services.,97,,
501,0.97,5027.055,5055.583,"As long as the funding for these programs continues to come from SPD cuts and as long as SPD continues to use its salary savings to Backfill these cuts, there is an ongoing call on those funds, and so here again, it is a situation where in the future, if SPD is to add officers, then there would need to be an amount of money.",97,,
502,0.97,5055.583,5057.752,The work schedule Timekeeping project is a $2 million project.,97,,
503,0.97,5057.752,5065.727,"The first 500,000 came last year, the 1.5 million for the rest of it is this year.",97,,
504,0.97,5065.727,5074.602,"The post basic law enforcement training position is actually a Pre-Basic law enforcement training position that was a Typo, and I apologize.",97,,
505,0.97,5074.602,5099.16,"This is a program that is starting this year with a position that the Council funded at the chief's request, and this program is one where the chief is taking recruits and bringing them on board before he sends them to the Academy, and exposing them to a curricula of trauma informed care and social emotional learning.",97,,
506,0.97,5099.16,5110.505,And this learning would occur outside of the classroom and it exposes them to Community-Based and Peer-Based learning.,97,,
507,0.97,5110.505,5117.512,"I am focusing on this because the Department has indicated that if they had more funding, that they would concentrate on this program.",97,,
508,0.97,5117.512,5138.8,"And that they would invest it in the direct--in the development of a curriculum and in the implementation of basically an evaluation and outcome measure for the program, as it is fully unlimited.",97,,
509,0.97,5138.8,5143.638,"So, we will come back to that later.",97,,
510,0.97,5143.638,5147.342,But want to note that that is a priority for the Department.,97,,
511,0.97,5147.342,5165.026,"That position is included in the civilian personnel costs in the 2.1 million underlying A. and Lastly is the evidence to pass the $500,000 item that the Council added in the midyear supplemental.",97,,
512,0.97,5165.026,5172.867,"That is not something that is funded, again, in 2022.",97,,
513,0.97,5172.867,5181.042,"It indicates that FAS, where the money moved to, is not sure how they are going to use the funding.",97,,
514,0.97,5181.042,5189.45,And that it is more than likely that they will move that funding through the carry forward into 2022.,97,,
515,0.97,5189.45,5192.987,"So, I will stop and ask if there are any questions on what I have presented so far.",97,,
516,0.97,5192.987,5197.258,Thank you very much.,98,,
517,0.97,5197.258,5214.976,"So just to clarify again for folks who are following at home, these are not necessarily additions to the SPD budget, they would be continuation of using the officers salary savings as noted in the title here in the table bottom.",98,,
518,0.97,5214.976,5215.777,That is correct.,99,,
519,0.97,5215.777,5216.411,Thank you.,100,,
520,0.97,5216.411,5218.913,"Patty, the slide--well --",101,,
521,0.97,5218.913,5227.121,"Greg, did you have additional fabrication before Councilmember Morales?",102,,
522,0.97,5227.121,5227.589,No.,103,,
523,0.97,5227.589,5228.189,"Okay, great.",104,,
524,0.97,5228.189,5229.123,Councilmember Morales.,104,,
525,0.97,5229.123,5237.532,"Greg, I am going to see if I can ask you to explain it again.",105,,
526,0.97,5237.532,5238.666,[Laughter] okay.,105,,
527,0.97,5238.666,5243.137,"Let's Scoot to slide five, Patty, if that is okay.",105,,
528,0.97,5243.137,5251.312,"And I think I know what you are saying, but I do want to just ask a few questions.",105,,
529,0.97,5251.312,5264.559,"So, slide five, there is a request for 4.7 million of salary savings to pay for separation pay costs in 2022.",105,,
530,0.97,5264.559,5268.963,Mi right on that so far?,105,,
531,0.97,5268.963,5290.785,"So what I am trying to understand is why costs come out of salary savings related to officers separating in 2022, instead of salary savings from officers that separated in 2021, that would presumably stay empty in 2022.",105,,
532,0.97,5290.785,5309.47,"These particular officers--the $2 million, the shortfall in estimated 2022 are for the officers that are leaving in 2022, the 94 separations or so that are in the staffing plan for 2022.",106,,
533,0.97,5309.47,5324.319,"There is no--there is no separation pay reserved for any officers in the Department's budget, separation pay has historically come out of salary savings.",106,,
534,0.97,5324.319,5333.528,"And the Department is concerned that if all of the salary savings is taken, they will not have any money to pay for separation for any of their officers.",106,,
535,0.97,5333.528,5342.203,And so this is a hold on some of the salary savings to be able to pay for those officers that are separated.,106,,
536,0.97,5342.203,5352.547,"And then if we could--thank you--if we could go to slide six, I am having trouble with Reallocating salary savings to things.",107,,
537,0.97,5352.547,5362.924,"So, if the 700,000 was transferred out of SPD to fund triage one, that came from the supplement budget.",107,,
538,0.97,5362.924,5364.759,Right?,107,,
539,0.97,5364.759,5364.992,Yes.,108,,
540,0.97,5364.992,5369.63,"So that was not a true cut, right?",109,,
541,0.97,5369.63,5372.667,Sorry about that.,110,,
542,0.97,5372.667,5376.971,Will turn that off.,110,,
543,0.97,5376.971,5385.246,"So, was that from salary savings or was that a cut?",110,,
544,0.97,5385.246,5386.814,It seems like it cannot be both.,110,,
545,0.97,5386.814,5406.667,"It was a cut, it was a cut of money that was not being used because officers were not meeting to be paid because they had left, it was salary savings.",111,,
546,0.97,5406.667,5424.886,"So I guess, part of what I'm trying to figure out, there are several things in here where it is Backfill and it seems to me that if funding is being removed to do the work somewhere else, why should we Backfill if that work isn't happening?",112,,
547,0.97,5424.886,5426.954,That is one thing I'm trying to figure out.,112,,
548,0.97,5426.954,5449.21,"And, with regards to triage one or community safety or any of the other ways in which we are trying to basically reduce the Footprint of the Department, then the funding that goes with that should not be Backfilled with salary savings.",112,,
549,0.97,5449.21,5451.245,"That is how my brain is thinking about it, anyway.",112,,
550,0.97,5451.245,5455.316,It may be that I am just using budget speak when I say that it is being Backfilled.,113,,
551,0.97,5455.316,5463.324,"Another way to say it is that the money, the salary savings, are being cut and moved to Hsd.",113,,
552,0.97,5463.324,5466.227,That is a more simple way to say it.,113,,
553,0.97,5466.227,5490.451,"Maybe try adding in here, I think that part of the challenge in trying to explain this is, there staffing plan is assuming a certain amount of vacancies next year that they will not fill in there staffing model, so, but they are still technically sort of funded for those positions.",114,,
554,0.97,5490.451,5495.79,And so they are Repurposing those dollars in 2022 but they are not eliminating the positions.,114,,
555,0.97,5495.79,5518.646,"And so there is a one-time sort of movement of the money out for triage one, but next year if there staffing plan--if those pockets are retained, and the staffing plan suggests they can fill them, we are going to have an issue because we are going to need different funding for triage one because they will need the money they use this year for triage one to pay those officers.",114,,
556,0.97,5518.646,5530.024,So I think that is where it is getting a little confusion is that these are like one-time cuts for ongoing needs from SPD's budget.,114,,
557,0.97,5530.024,5533.594,They are ongoing so long as they keep the budget authority for those Positios.,115,,
558,0.97,5533.594,5538.9,Correct.,116,,
559,0.97,5538.9,5539.734,That is correct.,117,,
560,0.97,5539.734,5544.639,"So if we remove the authority for those budget positions, they will no longer be considered ongoing expenses.",118,,
561,0.97,5544.639,5545.306,That's right.,119,,
562,0.97,5545.306,5546.307,That is correct.,120,,
563,0.97,5546.307,5546.941,"Okay, thank you.",121,,
564,0.97,5546.941,5549.644,Let's keep going.,122,,
565,0.97,5549.644,5554.815,"Okay, so I think we're going to go to slide seven?",123,,
566,0.97,5554.815,5566.994,"Okay, so this is the last bucket and this bucket is new initiatives.",123,,
567,0.97,5566.994,5571.232,"And this is using salary savings for 3 specific things, all three of which are in my issue identification.",123,,
568,0.97,5571.232,5591.852,"Technology investments, $5 million, some of which are a continuation of items that were funded in the midyear supplemental.",123,,
569,0.97,5591.852,5598.259,"Hiring incentives, I think you're familiar with, it was an idea that was brought forward in the midyear supplemental, and an additional CSO unit, also an idea that was brought forward midyear.",123,,
570,0.97,5598.259,5605.466,"The amount of investments last year in the midyear supplemental, 15.4 million, the amount of investment that they would make with the salary savings this year would be 17.8 million.",123,,
571,0.97,5605.466,5622.984,"So that 17.8 million is not quite--does not quite totally salary savings that I just spoke about a minute ago, the salary savings I spoke about a minute ago that is available is 19 million.",123,,
572,0.97,5622.984,5631.959,"And so with that as a transition, I will go ahead and move us into the first issue, salary savings.",123,,
573,0.97,5631.959,5633.527,If you can flip the slide.,123,,
574,0.97,5633.527,5638.632,"So, there is much more narrative here than there needs to be, I apologize.",123,,
575,0.97,5638.632,5658.753,"But basically option a is to take the difference with what is available in salary savings, which is the $19 million, and what the Department plans to spend with its salary savings, which is the 17.8 million that I just showed you.",123,,
576,0.97,5658.753,5668.062,"And to cut the difference, 1.1 million in salary savings that is currently Unprogrammed.",123,,
577,0.97,5668.062,5672.967,And we have already talked about how that salary savings is accruing.,123,,
578,0.97,5672.967,5686.28,"It is accruing from vacant positions that as Councilmember Morales noted, are vacant, but funded and the salary is being used for other things.",123,,
579,0.97,5686.28,5693.888,"Number two, or option B, would be to potentially assume a different staffing plan.",123,,
580,0.97,5693.888,5730.725,"And the Council did that last year with Cva, SPD, 025B, 002, the executive had submitted a staffing plan, if I recall, that had 90 separations and it was appearing at the time that there were going to be a lot more officers leaving and so the council said, well, I think they are going to see more like 114 leave, and so the difference was captured in CBA.",123,,
581,0.97,5730.725,5742.837,"And that can be something that the Council would do this year, if there was, in the fall, any kind of a sign that officers may be leaving.",123,,
582,0.97,5742.837,5752.513,"And three would be no action and of course there are other options that are available, that is just two that I picked out.",123,,
583,0.97,5752.513,5759.053,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Herbold and then Pedersen.",124,,
584,0.97,5759.053,5787.281,"Thank you, and so just, even just looking at the, I think modest, conservative approach of option a, that is a number that, if there was a proposal to capture $1.1 million of Unprogrammed salary savings, and that proposal was made today, it would be 1.1 million.",125,,
585,0.97,5787.281,5793.954,"If we use that same framework and Revisited it in November, it might be a different number.",125,,
586,0.97,5793.954,5795.289,"Is that right, Greg?",125,,
587,0.97,5795.289,5809.003,Because that number is based on a hiring plan that is based on the number of officers that they have now.,125,,
588,0.97,5809.003,5820.581,"And if there is a loss of more numbers, more officers between now and November, the assumptions that go into option a will change.",125,,
589,0.97,5820.581,5821.815,"Is, fundamentally correct.",126,,
590,0.97,5821.815,5826.153,Thank you.,127,,
591,0.97,5829.757,5835.629,Can I ask a quick clarifying question?,128,,
592,0.97,5835.629,5838.032,"I don't mean to interrupt you, just a quick tag onto that.",128,,
593,0.97,5838.032,5843.737,"Is it not just the number of officers who were leaving, but it is is it also be slower than expected hiring rate?",128,,
594,0.97,5843.737,5855.115,"So for 53 recruits right now, and it is anticipated to be that 85 or so number that you put in the chart?",128,,
595,0.97,5855.115,5859.854,Is it also a matter of capturing those potential costs savings?,128,,
596,0.97,5859.854,5872.967,"Yes, the Council could certainly assume the other way on hiring and assume that the Department would not get to 125 hires.",129,,
597,0.97,5872.967,5880.574,And there would be a potential to take funding for that.,129,,
598,0.97,5880.574,5903.898,"That gets a little bit Trickier in the sense that I think the Department would have questions about whether the Council would be in that action, restricting the hiring plan for the Department.",129,,
599,0.97,5903.898,5907.434,"So, that would be something that the Council might want to consider as they are taking that action.",129,,
600,0.97,5907.434,5910.571,"Okay, and I guess I was thinking about looking at the actual hires in 2021.",130,,
601,0.97,5910.571,5920.481,I think of option two as the option that is questioning their assumptions.,131,,
602,0.97,5920.481,5921.682,That they got the hiring plan.,131,,
603,0.97,5921.682,5932.926,But option one is sort of accepting their assumptions but adjusting it as the conditions change.,131,,
604,0.97,5932.926,5935.896,"Greg, is that the right way to think about those options?",131,,
605,0.97,5935.896,5946.14,"I think that is true, but in option B I am only talking about the Exiting side or the separation side.",132,,
606,0.97,5946.14,5967.361,"Councilmember Mosqueda is right, you could challenge the hiring side, just as I mentioned, then the Department might have questions, they might ask, do you want us--if we hit 90, let's say the Council Pics 90, do you want us to stop?",132,,
607,0.97,5967.361,5984.979,"And remind me, when we had a similar conversation last year, we did not say, Hey, if you exceed or meet your hiring goals then we want you to stop, we just said, let us know if you actually seated, is that correct?",133,,
608,0.97,5984.979,5993.554,The Council did not change the hiring side of the equation.,134,,
609,0.97,5993.554,5995.189,The Council only changed the assumptions on separations.,134,,
610,0.97,5995.189,5995.989,"Okay, thanks, Greg.",135,,
611,0.97,5995.989,5997.791,"Sorry, it has been a long 12 months.",135,,
612,0.97,5997.791,5998.492,Thanks for the reminder.,135,,
613,0.97,5998.492,5999.893,"Councilmember Pedersen, thanks for your patience.",135,,
614,0.97,5999.893,6002.363,Apologies for the interruption.,135,,
615,0.97,6002.363,6006.066,Chair Mosqueda.,136,,
616,0.97,6006.066,6043.237,"On this item about considering option a, 1.1, we recently had a discussion on this Unprogrammed salary savings that was for 2021, it was a similar amount of money and I had put forward a plan to try to retain existing officers, I think when we were talking earlier about ambitious hiring goals from the Department and how difficult it is to meet those goals, I think to me at least, it points to the need to do more to retain the officers that we currently have.",136,,
617,0.97,6043.237,6060.421,"And so I would just want to encourage colleagues to consider, if there are savings here, to not necessarily have savings to take, but to try to retain the officers that we have, to consider attention.",136,,
618,0.97,6060.421,6068.061,"I did not see a lot in the budget, and the proposed budget Unfortunately, for retention.",136,,
619,0.97,6068.061,6078.172,"And I think this could be an opportunity that we all could consider as a Council to retain those, especially if we are concerned about SPD meeting there ambitious hiring schedule.",136,,
620,0.97,6078.172,6081.842,Thank you.,136,,
621,0.97,6081.842,6086.38,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",137,,
622,0.97,6086.38,6086.78,"Okay, great.",137,,
623,0.97,6086.78,6089.283,Let's continue to the next slide.,137,,
624,0.97,6089.283,6095.989,"All right, the next issue is restoration of reductions that were made in the 2021 budget.",138,,
625,0.97,6095.989,6104.398,"In the 2021 budget, there were three different kinds of cuts that were made.",138,,
626,0.97,6104.398,6108.168,"I will address them in turn here, the first one in the table is on overtime.",138,,
627,0.97,6108.168,6119.68,"And this cut was a $6.4 million cuts to SP's overtime budget, it consisted of two discrete actions.",138,,
628,0.97,6119.68,6131.325,"The first one was a $2.7 million cut that was made in the proposed budget by the Mayor, it was based on forecasted decrease in demand for special events because of Covid.",138,,
629,0.97,6131.325,6169.763,"And also the discontinuation of patrols . The second part of that cut was a $3.7 million cut that the Council made in CBA SPD 010-8003, also with the assumption that special events and other overtime funded activities, things that would be affected by Covid such as traffic enforcement or many of the other Department functions, there would be a decrease in demand for those as well.",138,,
630,0.97,6169.763,6181.275,"So those two things together added to the $6.4 million reduction, and that left, of the events budget that SPD has, 3.7 million for them in 2021.",138,,
631,0.97,6181.275,6201.261,"There was a Covid related travel and training budget, and the travel and training budget I think, most folks are familiar, that is one that is used to fund civilian training, make sure that is not confused with the sworn training, that is a different budget altogether.",138,,
632,0.97,6201.261,6204.665,"This is mostly about civilians getting continuing education, attending conferences, etc.",138,,
633,0.97,6204.665,6207.167,And Certifications.,138,,
634,0.97,6207.167,6226.987,"That receives $175,000 cuts in the 2021 budget, and here again, that cut was around the assumption that there would be fewer opportunities for training as National training events were shut down due to Covid.",138,,
635,0.97,6226.987,6244.504,"And then Lastly, the discretionary purchases budget, I think most folks are familiar with that, that is operating supplies, equipment, that one has everything in it from ammunition to water that is circulated during events.",138,,
636,0.97,6244.504,6245.939,"That one had a $300,000 cut.",138,,
637,0.97,6245.939,6266.426,"That one was not based on the idea that Covid would affect demand, that was one that was not necessarily related to Covid and did not specify Covid or suggest that there would be any sort of Covid demand issues at all.",138,,
638,0.97,6266.426,6278.739,"I will note that the Department has, the Mayor, has restored all of these reductions in the 2022 proposed budget.",138,,
639,0.97,6278.739,6282.042,All of them have been fully restored.,138,,
640,0.97,6282.042,6300.494,"The department has said that the Covid related overtime reduction, the 6.4 million, is going to need to be used because there are a number of events that are going to be coming back this year.",138,,
641,0.97,6300.494,6326.787,"Or next year, I am sorry, that this year, we are going to see probably, well, this year to date, the Department has seen 144 events and if you look back to 2019, there has been 603 events, so even though we are comparing in those numbers, an entire year of 2019 to just a partial year of 2021, there is an order of magnitude difference there.",138,,
642,0.97,6326.787,6338.899,They also note that there are some new events like the Kraken games in climate pledge arena.,138,,
643,0.97,6338.899,6364.458,"They have talked about a backlog of Certifications that need to be addressed and then Finally, they have talked about the need to restore the discretionary purchases budget because the discretionary purchases budget last year when it received a cut was implemented with some Covid funding that was one time and was available to the Department.",138,,
644,0.97,6364.458,6370.263,So they are indicating that they are making it through this year by using some Covid funds that will not be available next year.,138,,
645,0.97,6370.263,6390.384,"And so, that would bring me to provide some information about how they are doing this year on these budgets, on the overtime budget, they are about 71% expended through September.",138,,
646,0.97,6390.384,6401.094,That does not include the $2.6 million that was provided by the Council.,138,,
647,0.97,6401.094,6412.806,"That is, the $2.6 million that was provided as part of the midyear supplemental budget was provided to help them, SPD, make it through the end of the year and handle the events at the Stadiums.",138,,
648,0.97,6412.806,6417.778,"They are 71% expended through September and they have not received that money yet, so that is some good news for SPD's budget management.",138,,
649,0.97,6417.778,6440.767,"In terms of travel and training, is much lower, they are only I believe 30% or so expended on that particular measure, and then on discretionary purchases, they are 81% expended, so that one is higher than probably it should be for being three quarters of the way through the year.",138,,
650,0.97,6440.767,6453.747,But it includes some encumbrances that they have committed to for the last part of the year.,138,,
651,0.97,6453.747,6461.621,"So I will stop and, well, I will say that the options here are to restore some or all of the reductions or no action, and then I will ask if there are any questions.",138,,
652,0.97,6461.621,6463.056,"Wonderful, thank you very much, Greg.",139,,
653,0.97,6463.056,6466.359,Any questions or comments?,139,,
654,0.97,6466.359,6471.932,"Greg, I am going to ask you one more time, because I have forgotten the answer.",139,,
655,0.97,6471.932,6484.644,"But I know we did a lot of work early last year, spring and fall, to try to move toward Non- sworn officers for things like traffic mitigation around special events.",139,,
656,0.97,6484.644,6492.786,I know there is a state law that is also Dovetailing with the desire to move away from armed officers at these events.,139,,
657,0.97,6492.786,6508.268,"Can you remind me, why do we can send you Sissy overtime costs related to sworn officers at these events when there is a large interest in moving to civilian traffic?",139,,
658,0.97,6508.268,6513.874,Mitigation personal?,139,,
659,0.97,6513.874,6522.682,There is currently a split of the special events traffic control work between PEO's and sworn officers.,140,,
660,0.97,6522.682,6530.624,"There primarily is a sworn officer at lighted intersections, where they are overridden.",140,,
661,0.97,6530.624,6543.136,But PEO's also do some traffic direction and both kinds of personnel will do various kinds of traffic work.,140,,
662,0.97,6543.136,6564.624,"It is a body of work split that would, if drastically changed, say, all of it is given to PEO's, or civilian responders or any kind of a civilian Flagger, could potentially be a union issue that would need to be negotiated.",140,,
663,0.97,6564.624,6577.671,"It is SPLITS right now in a way that the PEO Union and the officers Guild are, for lack of a better way to say, happy with.",140,,
664,0.97,6577.671,6600.994,"If it is the case that the officers Guild lost that body of work in its entirety, to a civilian Flagger group or to be PEO's, they might not be happy and they might file a you LP.",140,,
665,0.97,6600.994,6603.296,"Okay, more to come on that, thank you so much.",141,,
666,0.97,6603.296,6605.498,Any additional questions on this slide?,141,,
667,0.97,6605.498,6609.903,Council President Gonzales.,141,,
668,0.97,6609.903,6633.827,"Just really quickly, Greg, can you talk about the--any information you might have about the pressures that continuing to staff the special events is creating on officer time to respond to service calls?",142,,
669,0.97,6633.827,6642.235,Do you have any information related to that?,142,,
670,0.97,6642.235,6648.808,"No, I don't, Council President.",143,,
671,0.97,6648.808,6651.244,I am going to want to get back to you on that.,143,,
672,0.97,6651.244,6672.365,That would be great but my understanding is that there is some Scuttlebutt around requiring officers to have longer shifts in order to provide the hours necessary for doing this body of work we are discussing right now.,144,,
673,0.97,6672.365,6676.67,"And so, you know, I think that causes some concerns in my mind.",144,,
674,0.97,6676.67,6711.905,"And really, I think the policy question is that I would like your help figuring out if there is an answer to, the policy question for me is, you know, is it appropriate in the context of the staffing levels at the Department, is it appropriate for us to continue to provide this--is it appropriate for us to continue to utilize limited officer hours on For-Profit, private special events?",144,,
675,0.97,6711.905,6743.136,"I mean, we need the time that these officers have to actually do patrol, and the work that we expect from them, while we scale up these alternatives to law enforcement, so why are we creating additional pressure on patrol officers to both do the overtime related to special events and, you know, and their ordinary patrol duties?",144,,
676,0.97,6743.136,6749.442,I will check into it . sorry I do not have an answer for you.,145,,
677,0.97,6749.442,6753.747,"Great questions, thank you Council President Gonzales.",146,,
678,0.97,6753.747,6766.559,"And I know that is part of the solution, as you articulated, to making sure that officers are freed up to actually respond to high-purity calls, look forward to hearing more about that.",146,,
679,0.97,6766.559,6768.962,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",146,,
680,0.97,6768.962,6800.56,"I just want to reiterate that same line of questioning Council President Gonzales was making, as it related to the shared work of SPD and fire, around harbor patrol, and whether or not as management, we could make shifts in that, because of extenuating circumstances, associated with staffing levels, and the priority work of police officers and what they need to most be doing.",147,,
681,0.97,6800.56,6813.072,"I really think that we should be considering a different argument here, when it comes to these functions and overtime is another one of them for sure, so thank you.",147,,
682,0.97,6813.072,6867.76,"Absolutely, and I think that sort of is what I'm hoping central staff can analyze a little bit more thoroughly, I recognize that in some of these situations, we might have contractual obligations or have already made commitments to provide these public safety services, however, we made those commitments to provide those services contractually or otherwise, under very different circumstances than what exists today, and so I do think it is appropriate for us to call to question whether we should, in light of the extenuating circumstances related to the shortage in staffing, whether we should still require the police Department to move forward as though nothing has changed.",148,,
683,0.97,6867.76,6870.83,"Thank you, Council President.",149,,
684,0.97,6870.83,6876.836,Councilmember Morales.,149,,
685,0.97,6876.836,6877.47,Thank you.,150,,
686,0.97,6877.47,6889.882,"That just RAISES a question for me that I don't need an answer to right now, but I would like to know more about these contracts and their terms and conditions and what else we could do about it.",150,,
687,0.97,6889.882,6892.285,Thank you very much.,151,,
688,0.97,6892.285,6892.518,Greg.,151,,
689,0.97,6892.518,6916.376,"I think we will have to, we are at the end of this slide, I have to ask, since we have overtime in front of us, looking at this year's budget, is there any indication at this point that the Seattle police Department is going to stay within the overtime line item the Council has authorized in terms of spending for overtime?",151,,
690,0.97,6916.376,6922.515,As we have now passed I think three times.,151,,
691,0.97,6922.515,6924.117,"I think the good news is, yes.",152,,
692,0.97,6924.117,6925.084,I think so.,152,,
693,0.97,6925.084,6942.335,"When I looked at the financials a week ago, they were 15.5 million in spending on a budget that was 21.8 billion . The budget that is $21.8 million as the budget that they started the year with.",152,,
694,0.97,6942.335,6950.143,"You all added to that budget, the 2.6 million in the midyear supplemental.",152,,
695,0.97,6950.143,6960.453,So they have got the remaining budget and then some wiggle room.,152,,
696,0.97,6960.453,6961.854,Given the ad that you made.,152,,
697,0.97,6961.854,6967.627,"So, I think that it is looking good.",152,,
698,0.97,6967.627,6977.07,Does that also include the 1.5 from the under spend bill that took place in September?,153,,
699,0.97,6977.07,6977.737,"Yeah, it does.",154,,
700,0.97,6977.737,6981.641,It is the 1.5 million that you directly moved into overtime.,154,,
701,0.97,6981.641,6989.816,"And then there was a 1.1 remaining, I added those together, yes, it does include that.",154,,
702,0.97,6989.816,7005.198,"You would think we wouldn't even have to ask the question if they are going to stay within their budget, but given that that has been something that has come back to Council when they Overspend the budget, I think it is important to have regular check INS on that.",155,,
703,0.97,7005.198,7021.881,"I know that probably is an unforeseen question if you are working in the state Legislature to have to ask you Department if they were actually staying within their budget, but I'm glad to hear that is on track at this point.",155,,
704,0.97,7021.881,7022.215,"Thanks, Greg.",155,,
705,0.97,7022.215,7023.516,"Council President, anything else from you?",155,,
706,0.97,7023.516,7026.519,"Okay, let's go ahead and move on to the next slide.",155,,
707,0.97,7026.519,7033.326,"Okay, so, next slide.",156,,
708,0.97,7033.326,7042.201,"I had mentioned before that the Council, or that the Department is interested in spending 5 million of their salary savings on technology investments.",156,,
709,0.97,7042.201,7061.454,"The technology investments, two of them, are Continuations from investments that were started this year in the midyear supplemental, and I am going to go through each of these and try to put them into as plaintiff words and explanation as I possibly can.",156,,
710,0.97,7061.454,7063.322,They are not easy.,156,,
711,0.97,7063.322,7070.063,And I have had to have the Department dumb it down for me.,156,,
712,0.97,7070.063,7079.539,"[Laughter] so, the data Analytics platform, the very first items, $4 million, that one is a little easier.",156,,
713,0.97,7079.539,7081.207,That is when you are familiar with.,156,,
714,0.97,7081.207,7085.311,That is essentially a data warehouse that is collecting and Synthesizing data from a variety of different sources at SPD.,156,,
715,0.97,7085.311,7115.575,"It puts it, all the data together, and they use it for reporting to the public and for reporting to the Department of justice, for the consent degree, for all of the analysis that they do, any time Council ask them a question on disparity or any kind of officer Metrics, most of the things I have shown you in this presentation are coming out of the gap.",156,,
716,0.97,7115.575,7118.311,"Anything on officer training or performance, all that stuff is kept there.",156,,
717,0.97,7118.311,7135.328,So this $1 million is to pay for fees that would be associated with licensing and then also for consultants to keep the system up and running.,156,,
718,0.97,7135.328,7144.537,"I will fire through a bunch of these and then stop at the end for questions, but if something does not make sense, please raise your hand and I will stop.",156,,
719,0.97,7144.537,7152.378,"The officer accountability and trust Hub, which is called O.A.T.H., is something that was started in the midyear supplemental.",156,,
720,0.97,7152.378,7157.95,"It was funded at $350,000 this year.",156,,
721,0.97,7157.95,7173.633,"And what this does, it is a software program that looks at a number of inputs that officers are, around an officer's work.",156,,
722,0.97,7173.633,7182.074,"So, the number of calls they have gone on, the type of calls they have gone on, whether or not the calls are particularly tough, whether they are crisis calls, how long they have been on the calls.",156,,
723,0.97,7182.074,7187.18,And in the software will indicate whether or not that employee might need support.,156,,
724,0.97,7187.18,7192.885,And this is the next part of that system.,156,,
725,0.97,7192.885,7202.995,"It is part of the Department's wellness strategy, to be able to identify officers that could use mental health counseling.",156,,
726,0.97,7202.995,7219.111,"The next one is the equity, accountability, equality forum and Truleo software.",156,,
727,0.97,7219.111,7220.813,This one has multiple parts to it.,156,,
728,0.97,7220.813,7229.822,"The first part is a $260,000 Ãšinvestment for a contractor that will create what SPD refers to as a harm index.",156,,
729,0.97,7229.822,7237.029,And that harm index will be used to evaluate the Nicjr study on alternative police response.,156,,
730,0.97,7237.029,7252.311,"So we have talked a little today, the Council has an central staff, about the 29 different call types that SPD and Nicjr have identified.",156,,
731,0.97,7252.311,7259.151,"Most of which are not, well, I don't think really are any criminal, some are violations, citation violations.",156,,
732,0.97,7259.151,7272.465,"Those calls as well as, really, all of the calls in, could be run against this harm index, to see if there would be a risk to a civilian if you sent an alternative police response.",156,,
733,0.97,7272.465,7283.643,"And so the $260,000 of that 1 million some, a quarter of it will go to create the harm index.",156,,
734,0.97,7283.643,7298.791,"The next piece of that one, 200,000, would go for taking Body-Worn Video, the Audio from it, and turning it into typewritten, I say typewritten because I am old, but transcript did--transcription.",156,,
735,0.97,7298.791,7330.723,"And then that transcript and Audio would be subject to a software program that they would spend the rest of the money on, 540,000, and that software program would analyze the words that officers are using to see if there was a pattern in, or a change in pattern, around civility, professionalism, or De- escalation.",156,,
736,0.97,7330.723,7336.696,And that study would be done in conjunction with the inspector general.,156,,
737,0.97,7336.696,7341.6,"So you have three parts to that study, or three parts to that particular project.",156,,
738,0.97,7341.6,7352.712,"The next one is fairly easy, the next one is replacement of the blue team system.",156,,
739,0.97,7352.712,7367.56,"Since the consent decree was put in in 2012, the use of force incidents that the Department has been tracking has been tracked through a Standalone system.",156,,
740,0.97,7367.56,7372.031,The department has indicated that the data from that system does not marry up well with other systems.,156,,
741,0.97,7372.031,7381.941,"Like the Rms system, and they have data validation issues.",156,,
742,0.97,7381.941,7397.189,"So to solve those issues and potentially make it easier for Federal reporting, they are suggesting that they just put all of that use of force data into the Rms system and this project would integrate that use of force Module into the records management system.",156,,
743,0.97,7397.189,7405.598,The next one is the active wellness--active workforce wellness management system.,156,,
744,0.97,7405.598,7408.968,This is kind of an interesting one.,156,,
745,0.97,7408.968,7433.426,"So the Department is considering a pilots of what they call active 911, which is where officers would be listening in route to a 911 call, they would be listening to Audio of the call taker and dispatcher talking to the person making the 911 call.",156,,
746,0.97,7433.426,7441.4,And so the positive side of that is that they would have Situational awareness of the scene before they got to it.,156,,
747,0.97,7441.4,7456.549,"The potential negative side of that is that they could potentially be triggering fight or flight stress responses, and potentially negative outcomes associated with stress when they arrive on scene.",156,,
748,0.97,7456.549,7478.838,"So, what SPD would like to do is to run a pilots where they fit officers with Biometric shirts that would measure their heartbeat and their breathing so that as they are listening to the 911 calls, they can evaluate whether that is getting them Amped up, so to speak.",156,,
749,0.97,7478.838,7482.575,And whether that is creating any potential adverse outcomes when they arrive on scene.,156,,
750,0.97,7482.575,7494.053,"And so that is what that funding is for, is partly for the Biometric equipment and it is partly for the Piloting of the active 911.",156,,
751,0.97,7494.053,7501.393,I see some questions.,156,,
752,0.97,7501.393,7502.194,"Sorry, Greg.",157,,
753,0.97,7502.194,7504.697,I just want to make sure you get through the full list here.,157,,
754,0.97,7504.697,7507.867,"Let me get through--one left, let me get through the last one.",158,,
755,0.97,7507.867,7509.368,The last one is risk management demand.,158,,
756,0.97,7509.368,7523.015,"Risk management demand is, this is a software that goes Hand-In- hand with the--that goes Hand- In-Hand with the harm index that I was talking about.",158,,
757,0.97,7523.015,7533.092,The harm index would be created to evaluate whether or not a call would be safe for a civilian to go on.,158,,
758,0.97,7533.092,7553.646,"The risk management demand is the actual software, and I'm trying to put this very simply, but it is the actual software and evaluation system that would take the harm index and put it against the Nicjr study.",158,,
759,0.97,7553.646,7571.163,"So you would need both components, as I understand it, from the Department, to be able to run the evaluation on the Nicjr study and no across all of the call types, not just the 28 or 29, but all of them, which ones were okay to send a civilian to.",158,,
760,0.97,7571.163,7579.572,"The Council would need to invest the 260,000 in the Ea Q project and also the 750,000 in the R & amp; D project.",158,,
761,0.97,7579.572,7582.374,And now I am done.,158,,
762,0.97,7582.374,7587.78,Okay.,159,,
763,0.97,7587.78,7590.482,"I have some questions for you, I will put myself in the Queue.",159,,
764,0.97,7590.482,7593.752,"Councilmember Herbold, Morales, and then I will go.",159,,
765,0.97,7593.752,7601.393,"Real quickly, on the other live 911 pilot, is that being done anywhere else?",160,,
766,0.97,7601.393,7602.628,I don't know.,161,,
767,0.97,7602.628,7610.102,"I mean, it would be good to know what other jurisdictions might have learned about their officers.",162,,
768,0.97,7610.102,7612.571,Fight or flight response.,162,,
769,0.97,7612.571,7629.021,Rather than having to fit officers with equipment to read their Biometrics before looking at whether or not to do this.,162,,
770,0.97,7629.021,7654.813,"It seems like if there are other police departments who are doing a live, active nine and one Situational awareness thing, that we could learn from those departments, rather than going with this way of measuring, again, measuring the fight or flight response of officers.",162,,
771,0.97,7654.813,7675.367,"And then my other question, and I am sure you said it exactly perfectly, but as it relates to the Nicjr report, there are two items in this list that relate to it.",162,,
772,0.97,7675.367,7686.879,"There is funding in the equity, accountability and quality for him item, and then there is funding in the risk manage demand.",162,,
773,0.97,7686.879,7707.499,"Which is the one which is sort of the analysis for how we are going to change how we do things, and which is the piece which is, no, we are going to run--to a risk analysis on every call in real time to make that decision?",162,,
774,0.97,7707.499,7715.607,"Backing up to your first question, I remembered something that I would think I would have remembered right away.",163,,
775,0.97,7715.607,7736.628,"It is not being done around the country, this active workforce wellness management pilot, because that Department is working with the smart kids at Washington state university, to come up with the Biometric study shirts.",163,,
776,0.97,7736.628,7740.332,And I think we are on the cutting edge of that.,163,,
777,0.97,7740.332,7741.7,But I will get back.,163,,
778,0.97,7741.7,7749.408,"Okay, just because we are on the cutting edge does not mean nobody else is doing with 911, right?",164,,
779,0.97,7749.408,7752.544,"Yeah, I just had to promote Wse there.",165,,
780,0.97,7752.544,7753.645,[Laughter],165,,
781,0.97,7753.645,7754.046,Ago.,166,,
782,0.97,7754.046,7759.818,[Laughter],166,,
783,0.97,7759.818,7775.467,"You are correct, there are 260,000 in Ea Q that is necessary for the Nicjr study, and there is the 750,000 in risk management demand.",167,,
784,0.97,7775.467,7795.854,"I am told that the Ea Q piece, the 260,000, is coming up with that harm index, and so that is where you look at all the calls and you figure out where there was an adverse outcome that could have created harm to a civilian.",167,,
785,0.97,7795.854,7807.399,I am told the risk management demand is the programming and the creating of the software that allows you to take that harm index and run it against the Nicjr calls.,167,,
786,0.97,7807.399,7825.717,"Once the risk management demands software is--once the code is created and the software is created, in the future, it can be used to assist with live Deployments.",167,,
787,0.97,7825.717,7852.01,"So, the next phase, not this one, would be where a call taker or a dispatcher is hearing a case come in and the facts of the case would somehow be measured against the software and ultimately Dinged back against the harm index and they would be somehow told whether or not to send a civilian . that is my understanding.",167,,
788,0.97,7852.01,7858.45,It is pretty rudimentary and hopefully it is write.,167,,
789,0.97,7858.45,7870.429,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold 10 . I have to ask a question on this as a quick follow-up.",168,,
790,0.97,7870.429,7923.115,"To the concept of having a harm index look back at an that a person's own fight or E flight response is triggered, and they fought or engaged in may be a defensive way or responded because of the fact that there was an officer and perhaps that was--caused them alarmed versus having a case manager or a mental health counselor or a housing connecting percent coming up, it would be challenging for me to understand how a harm index is not able--I mean, is taking into account, the person's response in that moment, could have been also triggered by the fact they were calling out for help and instead of getting a case manager or mental health counselor, they were met with an armed officer.",168,,
791,0.97,7923.115,7951.843,"I think about Charlena Liles and I was not in the room and I do not know all of the Statistics but if a person is having a mental health crisis and they pull out a butter knife, if in that situation a harm index as it would have not been a good idea to send a mental health counselor, I have a lot of concerns about how that kind look back technology is going to help us remove officers from being in situations where they should not necessarily have to show up in the first place.",168,,
792,0.97,7951.843,7956.548,That is a good example of where officers themselves have said we do not want to show up when case managers are needed.,168,,
793,0.97,7956.548,7961.286,I do have a lot of questions about the concept you just outlined or that we have received from the Department.,168,,
794,0.97,7961.286,7984.276,"I also think 260,000 +750,000 to do an analysis of a report we received from Nicjr that has already had a third-party analysis on this makes me question why we are doing yet another level of analysis when there are two different versions.",168,,
795,0.97,7984.276,7986.945,Maybe that was more of a statement.,168,,
796,0.97,7986.945,7990.449,Happy to return it over to Councilmember Morales.,168,,
797,0.97,7990.449,7992.484,Thank you.,169,,
798,0.97,7992.484,8015.107,"I have to say, I share Councilmember Mosqueda's concern about using technology to look back on something that should have probably been addressed in a different way in the first place, but this to me just feels like a lot of money on technology to tell us that police are in high stress, high risk jobs.",169,,
799,0.97,8015.107,8021.313,We know that already.,169,,
800,0.97,8021.313,8025.25,"And if this is about officer wellness, I totally support that.",169,,
801,0.97,8025.25,8035.894,"I know that they probably need their own counseling and support, given the kinds of trauma that they experience and observe.",169,,
802,0.97,8035.894,8049.541,"And if that is the point of this, then I think we could spend our money much more wisely by creating, you know, officer mental health counselors or hiring a couple psychiatrists to work for the Department.",169,,
803,0.97,8049.541,8066.258,"I just think once we start going down this technology slippery slope then we are talking about upgrades and staffing and data analysts and I do not really need to know if an officer gets Amped up because of a call he is getting, or she.",169,,
804,0.97,8066.258,8074.633,I expect that that is what happens if they are called to something that is an emergency.,169,,
805,0.97,8074.633,8086.278,"What we do about it afterward is what is important and I would totally support providing greater counseling and mental health services for the Department, but this feels like a really slippery slope to me.",169,,
806,0.97,8086.278,8096.054,"And as Councilmember Mosqueda says, I am not sure that it actually serves our community very well.",169,,
807,0.97,8096.054,8097.389,"Thank you, Council President Gonzales.",170,,
808,0.97,8097.389,8098.19,Thank you.,171,,
809,0.97,8098.19,8110.535,I just wanted to let folks know that my office is interested in advancing a proviso in this area.,171,,
810,0.97,8110.535,8120.812,To allow for there to be greater transparency and understanding of what these various technology investments are and what they are not.,171,,
811,0.97,8120.812,8163.321,"I think as we can tell from the conversation in the debate occurring right now, it is still very opaque as to exactly what we are approving or being asked to approve, by virtue of this additional $5 million investment, and I think it is appropriate for us to encumber these dollars and prevent the expenditure and acquisition of--the expenditure for the acquisition of these technology investments, until we know a little bit more about what the city is getting in return for these technology investments.",171,,
812,0.97,8163.321,8205.063,"And again, particularly as it relates to officer wellness, it is still very unclear to me what the operational impact is of this kind of a program and I also do not have a clear understanding of how that information will be stored or retained for instances, for example, if there was a use of excessive force or deadly force, sort of how is this information going to be utilized moving forward?",171,,
813,0.97,8205.063,8237.095,"I think there are a lot of questions here and enough questions to, again, require that the police Department, at least on some of these technologies, to require that they provide the Council with some additional granular detail about what these Technologies are and what the benefits can be or what the risks are of having these Technologies available at the city to officers.",171,,
814,0.97,8237.095,8239.531,"Good, thank you for flagging mat.",172,,
815,0.97,8239.531,8268.827,"And I do want to also underscore the importance of making sure our first responders have access to mental health counseling, we have made sure there are two mental health counselors for example at our Seattle fire Department, and maybe you can confirm if I have this wrong, might be in a different central staff bucket but I think the two mental health providers have been included in this year's budget as well as transmitted from the Mayor's office, from the Seattle fire Department.",172,,
816,0.97,8268.827,8286.311,"I thought we added Attentional mental health providers for our front-line officers who are from Seattle police Department and I see you nodding, if you can confirm for me what we added and if it is the in the budget as well that would be great.",172,,
817,0.97,8286.311,8305.096,Access to mental health counseling is something I have Prioritized and will continue to do for our first responders and look forward to hearing other ways in which we can support mental health and trauma informed care for those on the front line but just wanted to remind the Council that we did add mental health counselors before and if you can confirm for me where that is at in this budget.,172,,
818,0.97,8305.096,8329.02,"I think probably my colleague is great to speak about that but I can confirm for you there is 150,000 in that table that we looked at for mental health providers for SPD and then there is also a grant that SPD is going to put forward that will have additional mental health services in it.",173,,
819,0.97,8329.02,8338.697,"It is here and she can tell you about fire, I see your hand is up.",173,,
820,0.97,8338.697,8343.935,"There is 150,000 on an ongoing basis in the budget, the 2022 proposed budget.",174,,
821,0.97,8343.935,8346.838,Thank you both very much.,175,,
822,0.97,8346.838,8349.24,"Council President, please go ahead.",175,,
823,0.97,8349.24,8352.544,"Sorry, that was a Leftover.",176,,
824,0.97,8352.544,8358.65,Thank you.,177,,
825,0.97,8358.65,8361.086,"Greg, I do have one last question, related to technology investments.",177,,
826,0.97,8361.086,8368.126,We had a pretty lengthy conversation late this summer as it related to the Seattle police departments under spend and the allocation of funding for I.T.,177,,
827,0.97,8368.126,8392.484,", at that time we learned there is a technology request that was being put before Council but the contract had already been signed, on I any of these items here, do you have any indication the Department head has already moved forward with signing or working on interpreting any of these, or is it that Council gets to make the appropriation and then a contract would be signed?",177,,
828,0.97,8392.484,8393.952,The former is true.,178,,
829,0.97,8393.952,8422.781,"They have committed to $50,000 in the Risk-Management demand bucket down on the last row, and they have committed to the 260,000 for the Ea Q study that Councilmember Herbold has Referenced for the harm index.",178,,
830,0.97,8422.781,8425.216,And that is what I am remembering right now.,178,,
831,0.97,8425.216,8443.334,"So Council, given all of the parties we do have to win for this budget, if Council somehow did not include the full amount on this flight, what would be the response to, if you know, from the Department given the commitments already made and the payments already sent?",179,,
832,0.97,8443.334,8459.417,"I don't think the payment is sent per se on either of those two I just mentioned, but it will have to be spent if there is a contract, it is my understanding there is a commitment.",180,,
833,0.97,8459.417,8470.428,"So I would assume it would mean there would be a hole in the budget, they would have to pay for it and if you remove the salary savings that they intend to use to pay for it, they would have to pay for it in some other way.",180,,
834,0.97,8470.428,8477.969,And it would be like a cut.,180,,
835,0.97,8477.969,8482.073,"Alley, I see you on the screen, do you have anything else you would like to add at this point?",181,,
836,0.97,8482.073,8512.804,"I was just going to sort of maybe state the obvious here but this is one of the, I think challenges and frustrations I have heard from this committee over the course of the last year, where there are commitments being made before the authority has been provided from the Council to spend the dollars . In general, they do not have--this is a proposal for anything for next year, there is no guarantee of the funding so Ideally they would not have signed contracts that commit them to following through with that.",182,,
837,0.97,8512.804,8517.709,"However I am not sure, Greg, if you were speaking to the 20 $21?",182,,
838,0.97,8517.709,8518.81,Versus the 2022.,182,,
839,0.97,8518.81,8532.223,"But typically it would be subject to appropriation authority, we can double check those contracts but ultimately they have not been authorized for any of the dollars in their budget for 2022 yet.",182,,
840,0.97,8532.223,8538.763,"Yeah, when I say that, I mean that the Department has told me they have made a commitment.",183,,
841,0.97,8538.763,8543.601,"I do not know how that has been Actualized, if they have signed a contract.",183,,
842,0.97,8543.601,8552.644,"Typically if they sign a contract there is a subject to appropriation clause in it, so they might be able to default on that contract.",183,,
843,0.97,8552.644,8562.053,"But if they did not default on that contract, then it would be a commitment they have made on future budget authority that they have not been provided yet.",183,,
844,0.97,8562.053,8572.564,So it would be not getting the authority would mean they would be getting a cut.,183,,
845,0.97,8572.564,8573.164,Thank you.,184,,
846,0.97,8573.164,8573.565,For our I.T.,184,,
847,0.97,8573.565,8581.973,"Folks, if you could look to see if there is any of our Councilmembers in the waiting room, I think one or two of them just got Aunt.",184,,
848,0.97,8581.973,8582.974,"Councilmember Morales, please go ahead.",184,,
849,0.97,8582.974,8586.678,"To that void the contract then, if they don't actually have the money to pay for it?",185,,
850,0.97,8586.678,8588.346,Because they have not been given that authority?,185,,
851,0.97,8588.346,8591.649,That gets legally complicated.,186,,
852,0.97,8591.649,8601.659,That is something I would have to tap the law Department because they have other preparation authority and I don't know what the contractor might argue.,186,,
853,0.97,8601.659,8606.898,I would have to get back to you on that.,186,,
854,0.97,8606.898,8611.202,"I don't know what kind of commitment they have made, I have just been told they have committed to those funds.",186,,
855,0.97,8611.202,8631.222,"To pay those monies in 2022 and it would have to be paid out of out of appropriation authority that they are requesting here, I guess not really requesting, they are saying they are going to, so if you cut it they would have to take it from somewhere else.",186,,
856,0.97,8631.222,8641.132,"Thank you, I appreciate your answer and that you will be following up to see if we can get additional context on the contracts.",187,,
857,0.97,8641.132,8653.778,"I think at the macro level, thanks for popping in, Aly Pennucci, I know this has been an issue that Council staff has been working with a hole on a number of different areas but specifically with Seattle police Department and spending money before authorization has occurred.",187,,
858,0.97,8653.778,8670.028,"We have two separate branches of government intentionally, I think this is an important reminder for the way in which we expect to be able to adhere to the state's Rcw which requires departments to stay within their spending authority.",187,,
859,0.97,8670.028,8694.685,"If we have now received a number of incidences within just the last two years that I have been budget chair where commitments have been made prior to authorization being given, it continues to raise for me, questions about what role the executive needs to have and what role the Council actually has, to maintain our commitments to two separate branches of government.",187,,
860,0.97,8694.685,8696.421,As being the ones who authorizes spending.,187,,
861,0.97,8696.421,8717.241,So I do want to make sure we continue to respect those roles and obviously there is a lot we would like to do on the implementation side we do not get to do because we have passed legislation related to budget and long-term policy and the Mayor's executive role is on implementation.,187,,
862,0.97,8717.241,8733.825,"It gets frustrating to be in a position where commitments have been made on future funding before authorization has been given, I do look forward to hearing more about the specific contracts on the macro level, I look forward to working with you all to continue to address this issue that has come before us now, at least three times.",187,,
863,0.97,8733.825,8736.727,With that I think we probably have exhausted our comments on this slide.,187,,
864,0.97,8736.727,8737.929,We can go to the next one.,187,,
865,0.97,8737.929,8739.597,I will go to the next one.,188,,
866,0.97,8739.597,8765.056,"As we are Transitioning, I will add a little bit to what you are saying in just saying that this SPD budget is different than any I have seen, in the sense that it is not cutting out salary savings that the Department cannot use, putting it back in the general Fund, and then requesting from the Council specific new ads.",188,,
867,0.97,8765.056,8775.967,"It instead leaves a salary savings in the Department, says these are funds that SPD is going to Repurpose for other things and does not make specific requests of the Council.",188,,
868,0.97,8775.967,8789.68,"So it is a different way of budgeting, and that is something you are pointing out that I think is not insignificant.",188,,
869,0.97,8789.68,8790.481,I will move along.,188,,
870,0.97,8790.481,8792.984,Issue number four.,188,,
871,0.97,8792.984,8796.454,Community service officers.,188,,
872,0.97,8796.454,8820.711,"The department would use 1.3 million of its salary Savings and would add six point zero FTE for community service officers, the last time that this program was expanded was in 2020, when the program was expanded to 18 community service officers.",188,,
873,0.97,8820.711,8825.016,That consisted of 15 CSO's and three CSO supervisors.,188,,
874,0.97,8825.016,8828.686,"Just by way of background, I think the Council is familiar.",188,,
875,0.97,8828.686,8837.728,"The CSO's are civilian personnel that are liaisons between SPD and the community, they do not carry weapons and are not sworn officers.",188,,
876,0.97,8837.728,8848.339,They are there to bridge the service gap on noncriminal calls and perform public safety related services.,188,,
877,0.97,8848.339,8866.257,"Due to the Covid related revenue crisis in 2020, there was a hiring freeze put on all civilian positions in SPD, that frees came just about the time that SPD had that program pretty well staffed up.",188,,
878,0.97,8866.257,8882.34,"And as CSO's started leaving the Department, they were not able to fill those positions and consequently they now have 10 vacancies.",188,,
879,0.97,8882.34,8886.477,"The good news is that the Department has in back grounding, enough candidates to fill all 10 of those vacancies.",188,,
880,0.97,8886.477,8963.321,"They also have left open the job advertisement that they used to recruit folks to get into those back rounded slots, I think I said in what their Du are.",188,,
881,0.97,8963.321,8976.801,"And I got back a breakout, 100% breakout, and what I was told was that 40% of their time was spent on community outreach and engagement.",188,,
882,0.97,8976.801,8982.673,"And that was things like attending community meetings, advisory Council meetings, public safety forums.",188,,
883,0.97,8982.673,8988.079,And things like community events or affairs.,188,,
884,0.97,8988.079,8995.686,Things like national night out or the Duwamish River festival.,188,,
885,0.97,8995.686,9016.307,"Than 10% of their time was spent on youth outreach and engagement, things like making introduction at community centers, day shelters, attending late-night community basketball center or the Duwamish use coalition cleanup.",188,,
886,0.97,9016.307,9024.014,"Than a quarter of their time, 25%, was officer requested 911, officer requested calls.",188,,
887,0.97,9024.014,9034.325,"And there they were doing a variety of different activities, they were providing Db support, mediation assumption is assistance.",188,,
888,0.97,9034.325,9068.926,"They were providing outreach supplies, food, snacks, blankets, clothing, in the summer, they were providing hot weather, cooling shelter, they were providing Arcing enforcement officers when they were approaching Rv owners, they were providing them with housing--assisting SPD parking enforcement with offering housing and other resources to individuals living in vehicles.",188,,
889,0.97,9068.926,9101.392,"They were giving pet supplies to pet owners experiencing homelessness, and then the last category, resource guidance, they indicate this is through Email or phone requests, so I think this is answering Email and phone requests, it is about a quarter of their time, and there they are providing referrals to crime prevention Coordinators, bias detectives Emma or mediation assistance.",188,,
890,0.97,9101.392,9106.163,"So, that is how they are spending their time.",188,,
891,0.97,9106.163,9122.947,"I asked if they had any data from their CAD system about the specific activities and was told that of the various calls that had been logged, 700 some, that they were not down to the granular level.",188,,
892,0.97,9122.947,9133.19,So they did not have the kind of detail that I believe Councilmember Gonzales was looking for on the specific activities.,188,,
893,0.97,9133.19,9139.296,And you can find those activities in Appendix f of my issue paper.,188,,
894,0.97,9139.296,9172.363,"And so, I think you have heard today that through the presentation on alternatives to police response, that there is certainly a potential need for administrative response, a lot of which may overlap with CSO's in their duties and that there are potentially outreach functions that CSO's do that could also fall into that bucket.",188,,
895,0.97,9172.363,9210.401,"So the issue paper touches a bit on that and with that as an overview to CSO's, I would just say that the option is not mutually exclusive for the councils asked consideration or adding the new squad and then potentially considering moving that squad to the cs EC or identifying that squad or that the CSO's themselves would be potentially administrative responders at some level at some form in the future.",188,,
896,0.97,9210.401,9211.802,"Okay, and now I am done.",188,,
897,0.97,9211.802,9213.17,"Okay, that is great.",189,,
898,0.97,9213.17,9213.404,Thanks.,189,,
899,0.97,9213.404,9214.972,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",189,,
900,0.97,9214.972,9219.677,"I'm sorry, I am Off-Camera, I am using my phone now.",190,,
901,0.97,9219.677,9222.112,Tech school difficulties.,190,,
902,0.97,9222.112,9246.537,"It would be really interesting to compare the the assessment of their current actual duties or their day-to-day actions, with what was conceived of at the beginning of the program implementation.",190,,
903,0.97,9246.537,9257.047,I know there was an SPD report on the CSO program implementation back in 2020.,190,,
904,0.97,9257.047,9274.865,"I think even prior to that, that was more on into Mentation, I think even prior to their there was a really meaty report on the sort of engagement that SPD did around the vision for the position itself.",190,,
905,0.97,9274.865,9300.758,"So like I said, it would be interesting to look at what we imagined we were creating, when we did so, and what it has evolved into now, as it relates specifically to the question of where the CSO's are located and really what the vision is for the CSO unit moving forward.",190,,
906,0.97,9300.758,9324.515,"I feel really softly that I would like to find a way to support a worker driven vision for both of those issues, both the issue of which Department they are a part of as part of the long-term scope of their work looks like.",190,,
907,0.97,9324.515,9333.223,"So, just flagging that and then one super quick and easy question, Greg.",190,,
908,0.97,9333.223,9350.808,"For the--not to--not the question of hiring for the vacant positions, but for the new squad that is in this your monthly budget, you mentioned that it would take a few months to hire them.",190,,
909,0.97,9350.808,9358.549,"Can you let us know, is this proposed in the budget as a full year's position for the squad of six?",190,,
910,0.97,9358.549,9359.35,Yes it is.,191,,
911,0.97,9359.35,9364.121,"Okay, so there are some Standings there.",192,,
912,0.97,9364.121,9380.07,"Yeah, if you assumed the Timeline for hire that SPD responded to the Council question, the Council asked, how long does it take to hire CSO's?",193,,
913,0.97,9380.07,9382.372,In SPD responded to that by saying 4 to 5 months.,193,,
914,0.97,9382.372,9391.381,"If you assume that Timeline and you assume that they would not start hiring the CSO's until they got authorization from the Council, then yes, there is savings there.",193,,
915,0.97,9391.381,9394.485,"Thank you, Greg.",194,,
916,0.97,9394.485,9405.195,"Okay, thank you Councilmember Herbold, you're coming in loud and clear, thank you for joining us with your phone, appreciate that.",195,,
917,0.97,9405.195,9406.897,"We have two more slides, right, Greg?",195,,
918,0.97,9406.897,9408.665,I think just one.,196,,
919,0.97,9408.665,9412.403,All right.,197,,
920,0.97,9412.403,9415.272,"All right, so, hair incentives.",198,,
921,0.97,9415.272,9428.218,"The 2022 proposed budget would use $1 million of salary savings for hiring incentives, this is something you saw in the midyear supplemental proposal.",198,,
922,0.97,9428.218,9436.126,"7500 for recruits and 15,000 for collaterals.",198,,
923,0.97,9436.126,9441.632,"And I am sorry, budget chair, you are right, the next slide is on the budget legislation but it is one issue.",198,,
924,0.97,9441.632,9466.857,"Talking a little bit about this, you saw this proposal earlier by way of background, ordinance 12 5784 authorized a similar one-time hearing bonus which existed for one year before June 13th 2020.",198,,
925,0.97,9466.857,9476.266,"On September 16, today 19, SPD issued a preliminary report on that bonus program, the evaluation only looked at one testing class and so it was very preliminary.",198,,
926,0.97,9476.266,9484.875,What it found was that 18% of SPD applicants cited the incentive as an important factor in their decision to apply for the job.,198,,
927,0.97,9484.875,9494.351,"Unfortunately the more thorough analysis of that program that was scheduled for April, 2020 did not happen because of the Covid emergency being declared.",198,,
928,0.97,9494.351,9514.304,"In terms of looking at the data, the hiring downturn that had started in 17, 2017, and occurred through 2018, had already started to turn around a bit in 2019, before the hiring bonus took effect.",198,,
929,0.97,9514.304,9536.293,"In the first six months of 2019, SPD had already started hiring more recruits and had hired 32 in total recruit and for lateral hires, however in the next year, when the bonus was in effect, they hired 107 recruits and 12 Laterals.",198,,
930,0.97,9536.293,9538.896,"So, that was more in line with some of their better hiring years.",198,,
931,0.97,9538.896,9573.931,"Central staff ask for data on local agencies that are currently offering hiring bonuses, and you can see there in Table 8, the data from some of the competitor agencies that are offering bonuses, that is important because there was, in 2019, a recruitment and retention report that said it is important to consider these kinds of bonuses because it appeals to prospective candidates by offering competitive wages, incentives and hiring bonuses are important.",198,,
932,0.97,9573.931,9588.578,And so that is some context that is probably good as the Council is thinking of whether or not to pursue these incentives.,198,,
933,0.97,9588.578,9590.581,"With that, I would stop and ask for questions.",198,,
934,0.97,9590.581,9591.248,"Thank you, Greg.",199,,
935,0.97,9591.248,9596.787,We will go Councilmember Herbold and then Morales.,199,,
936,0.97,9596.787,9600.457,Councilmember Herbold.,199,,
937,0.97,9600.457,9604.795,"I am sorry, I did not mean to have my hand up.",200,,
938,0.97,9604.795,9663.22,"But since you recognized me, I just want to very quickly mention, as I have before, we have vacancies and departments all across the city and in all of the city's Department, many of the cities departments, many that are focused on front-line services, that people in the city depend on and I believe we need to look at recruitment across all departments, as we know that in the last year, many people have left their jobs, so many people have, whether or not you work for the city or you work in private industry or Nonprofits, there is a lot of employment shifts people are making, and it is creating issues, for us at the city, as it relates to the delivery of city services.",200,,
939,0.97,9663.22,9694.918,"And so I am actually going to propose that we park these funds in finance general and ask for a citywide review of vacancies and a recommendation for a citywide policy focusing on any recruitment incentives on the areas where service delivery is suffering, using racial equity Toolkit analysis.",200,,
940,0.97,9694.918,9695.452,Thanks.,200,,
941,0.97,9695.452,9696.887,Thank you.,201,,
942,0.97,9696.887,9700.757,Councilmember Morales.,201,,
943,0.97,9700.757,9714.704,"Well, I have sort of a related question, which is, Greg, if you have any information about the city, whether we have hiring bonuses in any other departments, or for any other front-line workers right now?",202,,
944,0.97,9714.704,9716.339,"I am aware of none, Councilmember.",203,,
945,0.97,9716.339,9723.713,I have pulled my central staff colleagues and have not heard of any.,203,,
946,0.97,9723.713,9729.619,But I am not--I will do a more thorough search.,203,,
947,0.97,9729.619,9733.323,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",204,,
948,0.97,9733.323,9740.464,"And Councilmember Herbold take, today also see Councilmember Lewis?",204,,
949,0.97,9740.464,9742.032,I did not want to Miss you.,204,,
950,0.97,9742.032,9742.265,Okay.,204,,
951,0.97,9742.265,9745.535,"Councilmember Herbold, go ahead.",204,,
952,0.97,9745.535,9746.536,"I am good, thanks.",205,,
953,0.97,9746.536,9748.405,"All right, great.",206,,
954,0.97,9748.405,9755.378,"Thank you, I am not seeing any additional hands on this piece, Greg, and we have 10 more minutes.",206,,
955,0.97,9755.378,9756.046,And one more slide.,206,,
956,0.97,9756.046,9758.815,So I think we can get through it.,206,,
957,0.97,9758.815,9765.155,Just appreciate the early flags many of you have just noted and look forward to talking with you more about this policy concept.,206,,
958,0.97,9765.155,9773.33,"Greg, let's get into policy and the legislation you have flagged for us here in your memo and the slides.",206,,
959,0.97,9773.33,9779.469,"Right, they should be fairly easy . This is a budget legislation that would make the hiring bonuses possible.",207,,
960,0.97,9779.469,9790.48,"Again, 7500 for lateral hires and, for recruits, and 15,000 for collaterals.",207,,
961,0.97,9790.48,9830.687,"One thing to note with this legislation, as it was transmitted by the executive, is that it would make the program ongoing, as opposed to the legislation that the council passed a couple years ago that had a sunset date . so that is different about this one, and then the other thing that is different about this one is that it does not recognize the necessity to negotiate with the unions and so that might be something that the Council may want to add, and I should not say necessity, but the courtesy of negotiating it with the unions, tat is something that the Council may want to add in there.",207,,
962,0.97,9830.687,9832.522,But certainly the ongoing prayer is different.,207,,
963,0.97,9832.522,9839.329,And that is it.,207,,
964,0.97,9839.329,9845.101,Comments or questions on this legislation?,208,,
965,0.97,9845.101,9846.836,"Councilmember Pedersen, please go ahead.",208,,
966,0.97,9846.836,9851.908,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",209,,
967,0.97,9851.908,9888.979,"I like the idea of finding out what other departments may be experiencing, substantial attrition, I would be surprised if other departments were experiencing it at the same rate as SPD and I was wondering if that is something we could actually find out just during this budget process, rather than, you know, having to part with money and wage, if the human resources Department could--I would think they would be able to run a report on that relatively quickly in terms of separations and comparing it to the percentage of employees in those departments.",209,,
968,0.97,9888.979,9901.992,"And Greg, if we need to submit that question officially to asks human resources, or is it something you could just ask based on this discussion today?",209,,
969,0.97,9901.992,9907.397,"Councilmember Pedersen, if I could try to answer that in part.",210,,
970,0.97,9907.397,9919.876,"One, we can--questions are asked and not answered during Committee, we post to get responses, so no need to submit them again and our colleagues are helping us track those as we move along.",210,,
971,0.97,9919.876,9934.424,"I will just note that the city's information or data available on vacancies is woefully Unsatisfying, and it is something central staff has been trying to work on for several years, with the city budget office.",210,,
972,0.97,9934.424,9947.103,"But I think that in general what I would say is the vacancy information we can get is not very informative and it does not really tell the story, it is a Snapshot in time.",210,,
973,0.97,9947.103,9955.512,And also does not tell us if those positions are vacant and unfunded or vacant and funded and they are having a challenge filling them.,210,,
974,0.97,9955.512,9993.183,"We can certainly ask the question of Sdh are but I would also like to say I would love to work with Councilmember Herbold I think is who talked about submitting a slide to make a more--a larger request to enhance the city's ability to track our positions, whether or not they are funded or not, and providing vacancy data as it is an ongoing question that Councilmembers are raising and information we have been unsuccessful in getting a real handle on.",210,,
975,0.97,9993.183,10023.813,"It does also remind me that prior to Covid, numbers of the later management leadership Committee, if you remember that body Whe it existed once, which includes, it still exists in statute, which includes members of the coalition of city unions, the executive and the legislative brands, we have the meeting on about a quarterly basis to address issues of retention and recruitment, something that many of the city union members have been calling for for a long time.",211,,
976,0.97,10023.813,10048.538,"I know that there was a lot of interest when I first came on board to the city Council, to restart that body, which we did, and then Covid hit . But much of what they have been talking about as well, is what are the long-term strategies for retraining costs Seattle, giving our somewhat aging workforce and the desire to make sure we are bringing in new workers to our city.",211,,
977,0.97,10048.538,10067.057,"So it may dovetail nicely with some of the things that had come from the initial reports from the LM Lc, and I think it might help if we dig some of that up as well to look at the strategies for retention across the board.",211,,
978,0.97,10067.057,10073.83,"Again, perhaps too big of a policy issue to address specifically during budget, but I wanted to flag ongoing conversations with in other departments about the need for retention and recruitment also.",211,,
979,0.97,10073.83,10075.098,"Okay, thanks for your overview, Greg.",212,,
980,0.97,10075.098,10089.379,"We have exhausted our time, but you have kept us very well informed and I know that there will probably be additional questions folks have for central staff, specific to this issue item.",212,,
981,0.97,10089.379,10108.364,"We also know this, the last three days, have been an opportunity to scratch the surface on some of the questions you may have, so again if you do have questions you would like to field for central staff prior to our noon deadline on Monday, of course let them know.",212,,
982,0.97,10108.364,10118.108,But wanted to make sure folks have an understanding of what some of the opportunities are with the deadline for Monday at noon for amendments.,212,,
983,0.97,10118.108,10123.012,"This has been our opportunity to walk through, some of the high-level issues that central staff has identified on a handful of departments.",212,,
984,0.97,10123.012,10138.828,"But as you think about possible amendments to be submitted, remember it is concepts only, it does not have to be detailed or a fully fleshed out plan, central staff will work with you throughout the next week to finalize those ideas.",212,,
985,0.97,10138.828,10143.233,We would love to have any of the ideas that are absolutely parties for you to be submitted by noon next Monday.,212,,
986,0.97,10143.233,10157.046,"Central staff will then make sure that we refine those ideas, I said we, but they will refine those ideas, if you would like to keep them in confidence, absolutely they will do that.",212,,
987,0.97,10157.046,10166.956,"If you would like to make sure you are able to share those ideas with other offices, if they are similar ideas so that we can compare and potentially merge ideas that may be in a similar vein, would love to be able to do that as well.",212,,
988,0.97,10166.956,10187.677,"We will then have a conversation about amendments, October 26, 27th and 28th . as a reminder, the lead staff from central staff on that policy item will share a draft of your amendment with the sponsor to confirm that the amendment is consistent with your intent prior to its publication.",212,,
989,0.97,10187.677,10194.183,"That is why we have a deadline of Monday, so that all of those ideas can be submitted and they can work with you back and forth to finalize language.",212,,
990,0.97,10194.183,10197.887,"Please NOTE the amendment document is a central staff work document, though.",212,,
991,0.97,10197.887,10216.172,"This is not a Messaging document necessarily, there will be talking points that correspond with each of these amendments, so there central staff work product will be the final language that is Honing in on the policy change or the dollar amount change and technical aspects of why that is being made and the impact of it, the effect of it.",212,,
992,0.97,10216.172,10224.314,"I want to thank central staff for all the work they have done so far into the work coming up, with all of the amendments you all are considering right now.",212,,
993,0.97,10224.314,10232.188,And we look forward to working with you over the next week to finalize those amendments.,212,,
994,0.97,10232.188,10246.836,"Again, this is a critical component of how we do budget deliberations during that last week of October, so that it will inform our chairs draft budget that the Council will consider as our base budget for your possible amendments and consideration as we get toward the end of November.",212,,
995,0.97,10246.836,10259.916,"Thank you very much for your grace, your time, your patience over the last three days, we did pack Friday and appreciate you ending your week with us.",212,,
996,0.97,10259.916,10272.128,"Thank you Councilmember Morales, I see you so happy until the end of this meeting, appreciate all of the Councilmembers for being with us, we are going to go ahead and adjourn today's meeting.",212,,
997,0.97,10272.128,10285.274,"With a reminder that we have public comment again Tuesday, October 26th, excuse me, we will be meeting, Tuesday, October 26, at 9:30 A.M.",212,,
