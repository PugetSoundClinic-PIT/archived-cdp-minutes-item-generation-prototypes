780,0.97,4796.691,4806.334,It's an overstatement saying there's plans being made to contract with private suppliers.,144,,

793,0.97,4873.468,4888.016,I think the innovation here is that the utility is even acknowledging the fact that we will need to make changes in the portfolio to meet increased demand because of increased Electrification.,144,,

1041,0.97,6612.138,6648.675,"Again, these reinstatement benefits have economic value as a hiring incentive so the amendment itself clarifies that the officers that are Rehired, that are getting this package, Rehired within two years, are not eligible for the bonuses, people who are Rehired after two years and thus not entitled to reinstatement package, they are not considered by the group as Rehired and are not eligible for the reinstatement package and thus would be eligible for the bonus.",243,,

1074,0.97,6755.115,6811.971,"This would acknowledge that some of the provisions of Council bill 120389 may require collective bargaining before implementation, given that it also clarifies that the Department's existing use of 410 schedules, four days a week at 10 hours per day, this is a desired schedule of police officers, but that the Department's existing use is actually the result of an agreement between the city and the unions for limited implementation within the community response group, the officers that volunteer for that assignment and that further implementation of the 410 schedules may require bargaining but not be $10,000 regarding the schedules in this bill.",270,,

1105,0.97,6904.397,6908.067,Thank you very much.,294,,
1106,0.97,6908.067,6914.774,"Thank you, again for the opportunity to echo where I think there is common ground with the shared public safety and my colleagues.",294,,
1107,0.97,6914.774,6932.225,"Last week in the public safety Committee, we talked about how there was a joint concern being echoed by this Council that the previous administration has not yet followed up with the implementation of alternatives to public safety as funded by the Council and signed into law by the budget last year.",294,,
1108,0.97,6932.225,6969.962,"There is some optimism that there is a greater sense of collaboration on how we can move forward with some of the alternatives but we still are in a position where many of the strategies that are funded through the city, not the funding strategies of the Council directly funded to community partners, that is out the door, but the strategies within our own city still have yet to be realized and I think there is shared interest in making sure that the alternatives to public safety get the attention and expedited implementation they deserve so we can move forward with the commitments that were signed into law and Prioritized in the last few years.",294,,
1109,0.97,6969.962,6975.301,That is where we have common ground and I look forward to working with my colleagues and nature of public safety to push forward on the efforts.,294,,
1110,0.97,6975.301,6993.152,"As I noted in committee last week, I think this is legislation that is not necessarily strategic when we are in the middle of bargaining and that is why I voted no on the last amendment and did not have the chance to explain why but I do believe that this kind of conversation should be done at the bargaining table.",294,,
1111,0.97,6993.152,7064.59,"I also noted in my comments last week that it does not align with what I have heard directly from human service providers who are in direct communication with officers who, on a daily basis, are encountering people who are responding to a person down call or responding to people with substance abuse or mental health related needs, housing related needs, and in conversations officers has had with human service providers they have said, and I quote from the report, ""There is no amount of funding that can compensate for officers not having a place to refer people who are in the midst of crisis ."" that is where we should be focusing our efforts, that is what would help retention and recruitment strategies to make sure officers are not in a place where they are bringing people to Harborview as a revolving door are seeing the same individuals on a repeat--on a list of names they know because these are the same people who have no place to go come officers right now are being called to respond to those calls and we are doing everything we can to make it so that a badge and a gun person is not who we showing up for those calls.",294,,
1112,0.97,7064.59,7081.307,"Until then, what I think we should be doing is focusing on making sure that there is a landing zone, making sure that people who have mental health or substance abuse, housing needs, have a place they can be referred and there is not constant calls to 911 to show up for these individuals who truly need human services and not a badge and a gun.",294,,
1113,0.97,7081.307,7095.321,"With human service personnel when they tell me officers themselves are saying that additional compensation is not going to help them with finding a landing zone for people in high need and under high stress, that is what I want to respond to.",294,,
1114,0.97,7095.321,7110.336,"As I mentioned last week, a PR firm will not help officers have a landing zone for these people, hiring incentives will not necessarily help the force be able to make referrals that are necessary.",294,,
1115,0.97,7110.336,7137.396,"A marketing strategy we are paying for will not help that at $150,000 for a consultant to find any chief or help with the chief search will not help with those issues being identified from officers and human service personnel who see people on a daily basis who need additional housing, shelter, mental health, substance abuse needs, especially those with high needs and acute care services we are not meeting in the city and in the region.",294,,
1116,0.97,7137.396,7145.505,I look forward to looking--working with the Mayor's administration and our Council colleagues who have a shared interest in implementing the alternatives to public safety.,294,,
1117,0.97,7145.505,7153.613,But we need to both do that and pay attention to what our own city research has said.,294,,
1118,0.97,7153.613,7171.731,"Again, I will cite the recruitment and retention Workgroup final report which link you can find Online from our own city Department, a Workgroup which included the Seattle police Department, the report did not identify incentive pay as a barrier to either doing hiring or retention for the Seattle police Department.",294,,
1119,0.97,7171.731,7188.781,"The final report did not identify a hiring incentives as a recommendation in our city analysis of the hiring incentives use late last year show that, SPD communicated that the Department did not experience an increase in hiring since implementing a hiring incident in October of 2021.",294,,
1120,0.97,7188.781,7223.482,"As also mentioned in the central staff menu, the research director of the police executive research foundation nd executive director for the International Association of police Chiefs looked at whether or not there was any significant evaluations or research on the effectiveness of hiring cash incentives policing and they said, ""There is not yet a body of research to support this practice ."" so, across the nation and within our own city, there is repeated questions, concerns about this as a strategy to address hiring, let alone retention.",294,,
1121,0.97,7223.482,7228.387,Attention I bring up Lastly to note a number of concerns with the strategy.,294,,
1122,0.97,7228.387,7240.967,Our city human services Department summarized that offering a hiring incentive is a short-term strategy meant to induce prospects of an individual accepting a job.,294,,
1123,0.97,7240.967,7270.429,"However, the money is a one- time fix that may not compensate for uncompetitive wages, difficult or unresponsive working conditions, lack of opportunity, promotion opportunity, and signing bonuses, for example, from newly hired people can negatively impact employee morale as employees promoted internally are already working on the job as they can feel undervalued and unappreciated when there are financial packages to new recruits that were not available back then.",294,,
1124,0.97,7270.429,7277.169,This is what has been said as a potential Motivator for the legislation that was transmitted by the Mayor.,294,,
1125,0.97,7277.169,7285.244,"Again, our own city data said that hiring incentives are a potential for breaking trust with existing personnel.",294,,
1126,0.97,7285.244,7292.785,And makes it harder to retain trust and improve more out within our own ranks when we offer programs like this.,294,,
1127,0.97,7292.785,7316.942,"So, because this is not supported by our own city data, national data, I think we have more opportunities to focus on what officers are saying they need, landing zones for people, I will vote against this load--legislation today and will continue to implement alternatives to policing this Council has supported and I thank you for the time to explain that.",294,,
1128,0.97,7316.942,7322.648,Thank you.,295,,
1129,0.97,7322.648,7323.149,Councilmember Morales?,295,,
1130,0.97,7323.149,7326.686,"Thank you very much, Council President.",296,,
1131,0.97,7326.686,7338.898,I first want to say that I agree with Councilmember Mosqueda and I do not sit on the board but I agree that it is not strategic to offer incentives in the midst of bargaining.,296,,
1132,0.97,7338.898,7358.217,"That said, I want to say what I have been saying for 2.5 years, when we have scarce public resources, we should be allocating them in a way that truly addresses our public challenges, and we know that we have a lot of challenges for the city and they are things that will not be solved by the police.",296,,
1133,0.97,7358.217,7371.964,"Our homelessness crisis, our need for more affordable housing, our limited access to behavioral Healthcare, our neighbors are struggling to make ends meet and we know that many of them are experiencing violence.",296,,
1134,0.97,7371.964,7389.448,"And that there are community interventions that are treating the symptoms of violence, including the police, our Peacekeepers, regional Peacekeepers, violent interruption programs, these are important but do nothing to transform the neighborhood conditions that create violence in the first place.",296,,
1135,0.97,7389.448,7398.39,What we really need if we want to address public safety is to focus our energy on building healthy communities.,296,,
1136,0.97,7398.39,7403.462,Especially for our most vulnerable people in the city and young people.,296,,
1137,0.97,7403.529,7408.334,E need to put Resou changing the community conditions that lead to violence in the first place.,296,,
1138,0.97,7408.334,7423.082,"That means high quality affordable housing, good paying jobs, access to capital to support Entrepreneurship, youth Mentorship, school nurses, Afterschool programs, portable mental health and other Healthcare.",296,,
1139,0.97,7423.082,7434.493,The SPD budget constitutes almost 23% of our $1.5 billion general fund.,296,,
1140,0.97,7434.493,7441.667,That is--there are 42 other city departments and that rely on what is left to find their operating expenses and provide city services.,296,,
1141,0.97,7441.667,7458.117,"The SPD budget is 3.5 times bigger, four times bigger than the office of housing and 36 times bigger than the office of economic development, and the overtime budget alone is substantially larger than other city departments.",296,,
1142,0.97,7458.117,7492.251,"It has become a backdoor for growing the budget of SPD with little oversight into how the money is spent and we know this is a problem because we, as a Council, have been dealing with this for several years . until we acknowledge the disparity and the impact of the policy choices on the very people we claim we want to keep safe, until we Reallocate our finite public resources in a way that can change the conditions that lead to public safety problems, we will continue to spin our wheels on safety.",296,,
1143,0.97,7492.251,7505.064,I cannot in good conscience support continuing to deny other city departments the resources they need to provide critical services to Seattleites who need more that a badge and a gun to improve their communities.,296,,
1144,0.97,7505.064,7510.536,"For that reason, I will be voting no.",296,,
1145,0.97,7510.536,7514.773,"Thank you member, Councilmember Morales.",297,,
1146,0.97,7514.773,7515.274,Councilmember Sawant?,297,,
1147,0.97,7515.274,7518.544,I will be voting no.,298,,
1148,0.97,7518.544,7526.785,I have explained my position on this many times and my office has had a consistent position.,298,,
1149,0.97,7526.785,7542.201,"Increased policing is not statistically resulted in safer neighborhoods, the data shows that public safety is deeply affected by economic and social inequality, not police staffing and these monies should be done to reduce inequality.",298,,
1150,0.97,7542.201,7545.037,Inequality has gone further and further out of control and crime rates are affecting that.,298,,
1151,0.97,7545.037,7566.992,"As I said when I voted no on police hiring bonuses in May of this year, rather than pay bonuses, this money with increasing big business taxes should be put towards improving resources like public schools and Childcare, affordable housing, tiny houses to immediately sheltered those without homes, public parks and publicly accessible Restrooms.",298,,
1152,0.97,7566.992,7572.431,All should go Hand-In-Hand with expanding the number of unionized living wage inflation adjusted jobs.,298,,
1153,0.97,7572.431,7588.914,"It is not a lot of money in the 2022 budget, but the Democratic establishment is committing to a program of hiring bonuses, trying to add money in the 2023 budget.",298,,
1154,0.97,7588.914,7592.651,"Further, hiring bonuses are not the primary issue affecting police staffing levels or recruitment and retention.",298,,
1155,0.97,7592.651,7600.292,"If there is any more real question, it is because of the way the police Department has been used by the establishment.",298,,
1156,0.97,7600.292,7616.408,"During the likewise matter movement, the political establishment unleashed the police like an occupying Army into our neighborhoods, filling the streets with tear gas and flash bang grenades, as a result, earning outlets from community members and hiring bonuses will not overcome that justifiable outrage.",298,,
1157,0.97,7616.408,7624.883,Councilmembers have said that they wish there could be a accountability but they say there is an issue that needs to be negotiated in the contract.,298,,
1158,0.97,7624.883,7641.533,"This is simply not honest, and it is worth noting that Councilmembers who use bargaining as an excuse for the lack of accountability in the police Department have no interest in actually bargaining to establish real accountability when they do have the opportunity.",298,,
1159,0.97,7641.533,7653.145,"What is needed is real police accountability with democratically elected community oversight boards with the real power to hold the police accountable, including hiring and firing and subpoena powers.",298,,
1160,0.97,7653.145,7672.531,"Above all, this issue is a reminder of how the police under the capitalist system are fundamentally organs of state aggression against Working- class people and oppressed communities.",298,,
1161,0.97,7672.531,7678.07,The city's Democratic establishment is offering more and more money to police officers at the same time the Seattle police officers killed has not yet agreed to a contract with even the most insignificant accountability measures.,298,,
1162,0.97,7678.07,7696.388,"Let's not forget that they were expelled by the delegates, the region's labor movement, the rank-and-file union members in the Seattle area understand that an injury to one is an injury to all.",298,,
1163,0.97,7696.388,7702.694,The police force used by the ruling class to actively oppress our homeless and lower income members and communities of color has no place in the labor movement.,298,,
1164,0.97,7702.694,7704.697,I will be voting no.,298,,
1165,0.97,7704.697,7707.166,Thank you.,299,,

1167,0.97,7707.633,7708.767,Thank you.,300,,
1168,0.97,7708.767,7729.421,I will be voting for Councilmember Herbold's legislation we are nationally in a competitive marketplace for attracting and recruiting members of the police service in our community and in other communities.,300,,
1169,0.97,7729.421,7750.809,"Going forward, we know that a critical component of our comprehensive public system saying something has to be policing, there is no constitutional society that does not have some kind of law enforcement with a monopoly to enforce a social contract.",300,,
1170,0.97,7750.809,7756.014,It is important to have a police force.,300,,
1171,0.97,7756.014,7762.588,To retract--we need to follow the lead of other cities to be able to compete for the same pool of potential recruits.,300,,
1172,0.97,7762.588,7802.261,"Just a quick perusal will show that, if we look at some national city's that may not be peers, like Albuquerque, New Mexico, $5000 for new recruits signing bonuses, $15,000 for Lateral moves, Springfield, Oregon, next to Eugene, Oregon, $10,000 signing bonuses, and if we start getting in the habit of learning from other cities that are assigning signing bonuses as an incentive, we should extend our practice to learn from other cities on the other public safety innovations that they have been adopting over the course of the last two years.",300,,
1173,0.97,7802.261,7818.243,I specifically chose Albuquerque and Springfield because both have robust and well-developed alternative response programs to respond to a large percentage of 911 calls that we know the police do not need to respond to.,300,,
1174,0.97,7818.243,7830.255,"The growing national movement in low Acuity first response is something that, in 10 years, will be adapted universally across the country.",300,,
1175,0.97,7830.255,7846.305,People will look back on how public safety work in the Pre- 2020 era and will not believe what dine and dash police had been dispatched to.,300,,
1176,0.97,7846.305,7873.098,"Voting for this important legislation, there are jobs only police we can do and we have experienced significant attrition of police officers leaving without having alternative services to take on those responsibilities, I wish I could be voting for the package and saying that we are well on our way to being a national leader in providing those alternative responses.",300,,
1177,0.97,7873.098,7876.568,But we frankly are not.,300,,
1178,0.97,7876.568,7909.668,"As Councilmember Mosqueda indicated, this Council has repeatedly funded various different initiatives for response alternatives and we have not moved forward over the course of the last two years, I am encouraged by our discussions with the Mayor's administration, and our partnership to expand alternatives in the coming months with a renewed focus and effort that is a joint Council and mayoral goal.",300,,
1179,0.97,7909.668,7918.21,I think that will go a long way towards driving the kind of conversation we need to have a comprehensive public safety.,300,,
1180,0.97,7918.21,7923.081,This measure is important and critical to reverse our losses in the police Department.,300,,
1181,0.97,7923.081,7933.025,"In and of itself, it will not be sufficient for the result that a lot of community members have indicated a Rejuvenated police staffing plan will lead to.",300,,
1182,0.97,7933.025,7944.236,That can only come through a continued diversification of the available responders to a continued emphasis on public health and welfare improvement.,300,,
1183,0.97,7944.236,7979.971,"I just want to leave, as a transition, at the end of my remarks, to the budget conversations that will begin in earnest when we come back from recess, that the Denver Star program, which the Council, in the city of Denver recently appropriated $1.4 million contract to support, $1.4 million in Denver will support six bands and 12 workers for the vans to provide Nonpolice first response.",300,,
1184,0.97,7979.971,7982.174,It is within our power to do this.,300,,
1185,0.97,7982.174,7988.08,"Other cities are doing this, it is not Prohibitively Expensiv or unduly complicated.",300,,
1186,0.97,7988.08,7998.857,I think that we really need to center the conversation as part of our budget deliberation and continued to put resources behind this as this Council has done over the last two years.,300,,
1187,0.97,7998.857,8012.104,And have a renewed focus on a new partnership with the new Mayor where this will be a bigger priority and make sure this does not cease being a Council priority for executive implementation.,300,,
1188,0.97,8012.104,8023.415,"With that, Madame President, I will support this legislation today and look forward to future conversations to make sure we have comprehensive public safety policies in the city of Seattle.",300,,
1189,0.97,8023.415,8031.923,Is there anyone else before I make a comment and before we move back?,301,,
1190,0.97,8031.923,8037.062,Councilmember Nelson?,301,,
1191,0.97,8037.062,8049.274,These will be my only remarks.,302,,
1192,0.97,8049.274,8068.693,"So, on February 15th, a Reverend sent the Mayor and city council letters saying mothers for police accountability supports more SPD hiring to enhance justice and say the citizens deserve a safe city.",302,,
1193,0.97,8068.693,8084.943,In response for resolution calling for the relevant--hiring of new officers and this bill is the outcome I was aiming for which is why I signed on as cosponsor.,302,,
1194,0.97,8084.943,8092.984,"I think the Mayor and his team, and the public safety chair Herbold for being prime sponsors.",302,,
1195,0.97,8092.984,8094.486,Thank you very much.,302,,
1196,0.97,8094.486,8100.392,I will not repeat the grim shots fired Statistics I usually do.,302,,
1197,0.97,8100.392,8106.698,I acknowledge that we need a better way to respond to people in crisis.,302,,
1198,0.97,8106.698,8110.769,And we do not yet have that model set up.,302,,
1199,0.97,8110.769,8120.946,"I also have to acknowledge that we are talking about more than people in crisis, talking about systemic and serious crime.",302,,
1200,0.97,8120.946,8129.02,I do not believe we can wait until the conclusion of contract negotiations to start saving lives.,302,,
1201,0.97,8129.02,8138.797,"So, this bill will help us compete with other jurisdictions for the officers and investigators who we need to reduce the number of people shot and killed on our streets.",302,,
1202,0.97,8138.797,8150.976,"It will take years to build back up the SPD staffing levels and, obviously, the bonus, it is not the money that will get us there.",302,,
1203,0.97,8150.976,8156.481,"What is more important, I think, is a culture change.",302,,
1204,0.97,8156.481,8164.589,This bill is a recognition that we value the crucial role our officers played in creating a safer city.,302,,
1205,0.97,8164.589,8170.228,And the retention components are an acknowledgment that we need to foster a more welcoming and supportive workplace.,302,,
1206,0.97,8170.228,8174.966,"Let's be clear, this is a means and not an end.",302,,
1207,0.97,8174.966,8183.475,"For now, passing this bill shows that, when the Mayor and city council listened to the community and work together, we can solve problems.",302,,
1208,0.97,8183.475,8192.617,That is what a functioning city government looks like and that is what our constituents and new recruits want to see.,302,,
1209,0.97,8192.617,8194.886,I will be supporting this bill.,302,,
1210,0.97,8194.886,8201.159,"Thanking them--thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",303,,
1211,0.97,8201.159,8211.303,Anybody else have any other comments before I speak and we headed back over to Councilmember Herbold? I do not see any.,303,,
1212,0.97,8211.303,8213.438,I will be supporting this and voting yesterday.,303,,
1213,0.97,8213.438,8223.882,"I actually agree with everything all of my colleagues have said, even where they are on opposite ends of the spectrum in agreement or disagreement.",303,,
1214,0.97,8223.882,8231.189,"I believe your words and I believe your truth, I have seen all of you in the last two years and do a lot of hard work.",303,,
1215,0.97,8231.189,8237.495,"I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for taking on this very difficult, emotional, and complex subject.",303,,
1216,0.97,8237.495,8259.084,"We both serve on the nationwide search for a new search of--chief of police and we are in an interesting position, and our labor group, so the public does not see the hard work behind the scenes in dealing with the policy, the legality, working with the Union, the executive, and more poorly working with our communities.",303,,
1217,0.97,8259.084,8267.792,"We have learned a lot these past two years, things we already knew but really came to fruition these last two years.",303,,
1218,0.97,8267.792,8280.572,"I think we can all agree that good policy and common sense, and an understanding of who we are as a city, our humanity, makes a change, not slogans.",303,,
1219,0.97,8280.572,8282.44,I think that is where we are headed.,303,,
1220,0.97,8282.44,8284.643,Is this perfect?,303,,
1221,0.97,8284.643,8284.843,No.,303,,
1222,0.97,8284.843,8287.178,It is a step in the right direction.,303,,
1223,0.97,8287.178,8291.516,"I was going to share this anyway, but at another event coming up.",303,,
1224,0.97,8291.516,8300.058,I wanted to share the words of Dr. autumn Blackdeer because it is important.,303,,
1225,0.97,8300.058,8328.319,"We could talk all day about policy, about data, a lot of things that we hear but, at the end of the day, it is about how we feel about public safety, community policing, as autumn Blackdeer shared, standing in your truth to walking in your purpose.",303,,
1226,0.97,8328.319,8344.969,"Today, we are moving forward and walking in our purpose, hopefully, I believe, to a safe, healthy, and sensible policy that brings us, as Councilmember Nelson said, a safe city.",303,,
1227,0.97,8344.969,8351.876,"I want to say this in the context of the hard work we have all done, but it is time to start healing.",303,,
1228,0.97,8351.876,8372.564,"It is time to start having conversations where we listen to each other and not shout over each other, that we respect each other's opinion, that we get away from, if you are not with me, you are against me, that is not how we will get to safe community policing and protecting all of our community members.",303,,
1229,0.97,8372.564,8375.834,"With that, I will be voting yes on this.",303,,
1230,0.97,8375.834,8378.47,I will leave it at that.,303,,
1231,0.97,8378.47,8380.672,Okay.,303,,
1232,0.97,8380.672,8388.446,"With that, I will hand it to Councilmember Herbold to do closing remarks and then we will move to a vote.",303,,
1233,0.97,8388.446,8392.484,"Thank you, Madam President.",304,,
1234,0.97,8392.484,8395.353,Looking for my closing remarks.,304,,
1235,0.97,8395.353,8397.789,I appreciate the grace.,304,,
1236,0.97,8397.789,8408.733,This legislation uses existing money in the Seattle police Department budget towards the goal by Council supported to hire 125 officers in 2022.,304,,
1237,0.97,8408.733,8426.184,"This was approved in the budget, the SPD revised hiring projection is 84 officers for the year, significantly fewer officers are possible to be hired then the number of hires that the Council already authorized.",304,,
1238,0.97,8426.184,8460.718,"I repeatedly said that development of alternatives police response to 911 calls is a critical component of both our recruitment and retention and public safety strategies to make sure officers have workloads that are sustainable, Seattle is not a unique city, cities are facing shortages in police officers and we want to lessen the load on officers and create new and more effective ways of responding to calls that do not require an armed police response.",304,,
1239,0.97,8460.718,8475.967,"We cannot keep asking police officers to direct traffic, help people in mental health crisis, when we do not have enough officers to respond to 911 calls were investigate sexual assault.",304,,
1240,0.97,8475.967,8482.474,Being a first Responder is a difficult job and we should not make it an impossible job.,304,,
1241,0.97,8482.474,8508.066,"As police chief Brown noted in 2016, every societal failure we put on the police to solve, not enough men, not enough funding, but the cop handle it, not enough drug addiction funding, let the cop handle it, schools fail, that is too much to ask, policing was never meant to solve all of those problems, he said in 2016.",304,,
1242,0.97,8508.066,8511.102,The Dallas police chief.,304,,
1243,0.97,8511.102,8520.879,Being a first Responder is a difficult job and we should not make it an impossible job.,304,,
1244,0.97,8520.879,8529.487,"Councilmember Mosqueda has noted that human service providers tell her that officers, they are not developing alternatives to help people, that is harming to officer morale.",304,,
1245,0.97,8529.487,8539.964,"It is important, especially with fewer officers, to right size what they are asked because some things only officers can do.",304,,
1246,0.97,8539.964,8555.914,"My support for this bill, with recruitment and incentives proposed by the Mayor and SPD, has been dependent on the executives recognition of this additional important component, the recruitment and training objectives.",304,,
1247,0.97,8555.914,8563.922,The commitment to develop a new 911 call response system.,304,,
1248,0.97,8563.922,8582.44,"Last week,, the week before last I should say, staff, between the office of the Mayor and Council central staff, finally started the joint work, including the Seattle police Department, community safety and communication center, and the fire Department.",304,,
1249,0.97,8582.44,8603.328,"Additionally, the quarterly consent decree filing in the city last month memorialized these, that the Workgroup will recommend approaches that increase SPD for alternate response, priority three and four calls in the near-term.",304,,
1250,0.97,8603.328,8612.136,Through an alternate response pilot and evaluation of existing resources that could be deployed or more efficiently deployed on things like special events.,304,,
1251,0.97,8612.136,8631.99,It goes on further to note that the office of the Mayor will host planning mentoring recommendations on the Subset of calls that maybe they should divert from the police and estimates the process will be completed in the fall.,304,,
1252,0.97,8631.99,8640.965,I appreciate the Mayor and SPD bringing this bill forward and want to recognize the interim chief's new before the badge program.,304,,
1253,0.97,8640.965,8650.842,"When the previous Mayor did not include funding for this program, it connects officers with community in advance of state planning.",304,,
1254,0.97,8650.842,8708.366,"I want to quote from the Website for the program, three parts, meet with community groups to have discussions as individuals about policing in Seattle, work with the wellness unit to obtain tools to help with the stresses of the job, and learn about SPD precincts, officers, opportunities and leadership, and the Website reads, ""in addition, before the badge, it includes exploration of the policing for professions, races history, gender responsiveness, and the site of Relationship-Based policing ."" as part of the larger body work, the Seattle public safety civil service Commission has approved preference points for language skills in the past and is committed to working on preference points for community service this year, this is another way of ensuring that the people we are hiring for the jobs are the people best suited for them.",304,,
