61,0.97,308.007,311.044,"Good afternoon, Howard Gail Commenting on police accountability.",21,,
62,0.97,311.044,320.219,Today is the eighth day of the inquest into the SPD murder of Charleena Lyles.,21,,
63,0.97,320.219,331.964,We heard from one of the two officers that shot her that a Firearm was the only tool to use.,21,,
64,0.97,331.964,340.239,And a police baton would not be appropriate because that's only to be used for pain compliance and hitting her in the head with it might prove fatal.,21,,
65,0.97,340.239,343.81,This is SPD training.,21,,
66,0.97,343.81,347.013,Part of a horrifying circular argument.,21,,
67,0.97,347.013,355.988,You can't use force that might be deadly until you need to use force which then must be deadly to immediately terminate the threat.,21,,
68,0.97,355.988,364.731,This left six more people killed and families shattered in circumstances similar to Charleena's.,21,,
69,0.97,364.731,369.035,"In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends.",21,,
70,0.97,369.035,373.773,This Council has been loudly silent.,21,,
71,0.97,373.773,382.448,Our next Speaker is Jessica Scalzo.,22,,
72,0.97,382.448,384.617,"Hi, my name is Jessica.",23,,
73,0.97,384.617,387.987,I am a Renter in district three.,23,,
74,0.97,387.987,402.468,And I'm calling in strong support of Sawant's legislation to make Seattle an abortion right sanctuary city where there are free abortions and where Seattle police refuse to arrest people for abortion related offenses.,23,,
75,0.97,402.468,411.644,This is really important because we need to protect the lives of pregnant people who are more than 14 times more likely to die in childbirth than from an abortion.,23,,
76,0.97,411.644,416.215,And recently on democracy now there was a doctor who was talking about the safety of the abortion pill.,23,,
77,0.97,416.215,420.453,Which is used in one half of all abortion cases.,23,,
78,0.97,420.453,421.821,That is safer than Viagra.,23,,
79,0.97,421.821,427.126,And we do not have a problem selling and distributing Viagra.,23,,
80,0.97,427.126,435.234,And Lastly because our community and all communities benefit when women and pregnant people have agency and choice over their bodies.,23,,
81,0.97,435.234,438.871,Please support this legislation.,23,,
82,0.97,438.871,439.772,And thank you.,23,,
83,0.97,439.772,451.818,Our next Speaker is Margot Stuart.,24,,
84,0.97,451.818,455.288,Margot Stuart.,24,,
85,0.97,459.592,466.799,"Do you want to--do you want to call the name again, and if not we'll just go to the next Speaker.",25,,
86,0.97,466.799,468.234,"Sure, it's Margot Stuart.",26,,
87,0.97,468.234,471.204,"Margot, are you there?",27,,
88,0.97,472.004,475.341,Why don't we go forward and we'll come back to Margot.,27,,
89,0.97,475.341,475.708,,28,,
90,0.97,475.708,476.909,Can you hear me?,29,,
91,0.97,476.909,477.844,We can.,30,,
92,0.97,477.844,481.681,Is that you Margot?,30,,
93,0.97,481.681,481.948,Sorry.,31,,
94,0.97,481.948,482.148,Yeah.,31,,
95,0.97,482.148,482.715,My name is Margot.,31,,
96,0.97,482.715,484.217,I rent and work on first Hill.,31,,
97,0.97,484.217,492.225,And I'm calling to demand the city council pass Councilmember Sawant's legislation to make Seattle an abortion right sanctuary city.,31,,
98,0.97,492.225,492.792,No delays.,31,,
99,0.97,492.792,500.833,"No watering down, as well as expand the Amazon tax to make abortion access free and available for anyone seeking it.",31,,
100,0.97,500.833,502.835,These measures are incredibly popular.,31,,
101,0.97,502.835,508.341,In just over a week since Roe was overturned 4500 people in Seattle have signed in favor of both of them.,31,,
102,0.97,508.341,519.752,"And we really can't wait for the Democrats who have had 50 years to defend Roe but who have shamefully not mobilized women, queer people, Union workers.",31,,
103,0.97,519.752,521.22,Working people need to start fighting back now.,31,,
104,0.97,521.22,528.261,And I think this legislation can can serve as a key example of what is possible for cities with a movement building approach.,31,,
105,0.97,528.261,534.333,I'm sure there will be Democrats on the Council that make protests that these measures are redundant.,31,,
106,0.97,534.333,536.702,This couldn't be further from the truth.,31,,
107,0.97,536.702,543.576,The directives by Governor Insley and Mayor Harrell which were put forward by grass roots measures were positive.,31,,
108,0.97,543.576,545.311,But can be quickly overturned.,31,,
109,0.97,545.311,551.617,And we need to codify this into law and we need a movement to do it.,31,,
110,0.97,551.617,552.552,Thank you.,31,,
111,0.97,553.719,559.492,Our next Speaker is Preston.,32,,
112,0.97,559.492,559.725,Sahoba.,32,,
113,0.97,559.725,561.327,"Yes, Hi, my name is Preston.",33,,
114,0.97,561.327,563.329,I'm a resident of district four.,33,,
115,0.97,563.329,570.937,And rank and file member of the alphabet workers union which is a new local in the Martin Luther King County labor Council.,33,,
116,0.97,570.937,579.578,And I'm calling in strong support of Councilmember Sawant's bill for a--to make Seattle an abortion rights sanctuary city.,33,,
117,0.97,579.578,590.489,"I work at Google and you know, they just decided to--they sent these Flowery Emails about your right to an abortion is protected.",33,,
118,0.97,590.489,593.659,We'll make sure you can fly to a state where you can get one.,33,,
119,0.97,593.659,600.433,And behind their back the executives are donating to Republicans to make sure--to protect their own business interests.,33,,
120,0.97,600.433,605.571,And I think that corporate hypocrisy needs to be called out wherever it is.,33,,
121,0.97,605.571,612.578,Including here in Seattle where the Democratic party Councilmembers are trying to stand in the way of protecting the right to abortion.,33,,
122,0.97,612.578,618.184,"Both at an access level to prevent enforcement, and by expanding the Amazon tax.",33,,
123,0.97,618.184,627.86,I would strongly encourage the Council to stand with workers and not with Two-Faced corporations.,33,,
124,0.97,628.361,633.499,Our next Speaker is Jacob sheer.,34,,
125,0.97,633.499,633.733,Hi.,35,,
126,0.97,633.733,635.735,"Good afternoon, my name is Jacob sheer.",35,,
127,0.97,635.735,640.84,I'm speak on behalf of real strange.,35,,
128,0.97,640.84,653.219,Fully supporting Councilmember Sawant's legislation to make Seattle a sanctuary city for abortion and bodily autonomy and to fund abortion and abortion care for all who need it.,35,,
129,0.97,653.219,653.719,Repealing Roe.,35,,
130,0.97,653.719,668.2,We urgently and desperately need codified legislation in Seattle that goes beyond words and gestures the right to abortion for all who want and need it and protects those who seek and provide abortion care the persecution of those seeking abortion care is happening.,35,,
131,0.97,668.2,675.408,1300 people have been arrested or charged in the us from 2006 to 2020 for their actions during pregnancy.,35,,
132,0.97,675.408,691.524,"And with over a dozen States set to outlaw abortion and strip away reproductive rights of millions, you know, in a reactionary right wing Supreme Court and the very real possibility of a nationwide abortion ban cannot be higher.",35,,
133,0.97,691.524,694.527,We need codified abortion sanctuary States through legislation and we will do so.,35,,
134,0.97,694.527,695.628,Tank you.,35,,
135,0.97,695.628,702.168,Our next Speaker is Kevin Fitzwoong.,36,,
136,0.97,702.168,705.104,I'm an educator and Renter in district three.,37,,
137,0.97,705.104,710.643,I'm in support of Councilmember Sawant's legislation to make Seattle an abortion right sanctuary city.,37,,
138,0.97,710.643,720.486,Protecting pregnant people and doctors from arrest warrants that might be processed by the police you know in relation to anti-abortion laws around the country.,37,,
139,0.97,720.486,729.328,And we also need to expand extremely popular tax to make abortions here free and on demand.,37,,
140,0.97,729.328,744.51,"Democrat Haves provided very, very weak stance in this fight, and so working people need to organize and, you know, put pressure on Democrats and legislators to make this law in Seattle and statewide.",37,,
141,0.97,744.51,748.447,And so please pass Councilmember Sawant's legislation without delays or watering down.,37,,
142,0.97,748.447,751.517,Thank you.,37,,
143,0.97,752.051,763.929,Our next Speaker is Sara James.,38,,

145,0.97,766.565,769.702,I support Councilmember Sawant --,39,,
146,0.97,769.702,769.969,Hello?,40,,
147,0.97,769.969,771.337,Hi my name is Sara.,41,,
148,0.97,771.337,792.124,I support Councilmember Sawant's legislation I was happy to hear Harrell Insley support making Seattle Washington an abortion sanctuary but we need the full protection this legislation offers N. the wake of the failure of the Democratic party to codify Roe we need to take the legislative steps necessary to make sure these rights cannot be rolled back and can withstand right wing attacks.,41,,
149,0.97,792.124,797.163,The public position for this legislation has over 4000 signatures.,41,,
150,0.97,797.163,802.001,There's immense public support for making sure Seattle becomes and stays an abortion sanctuary.,41,,
151,0.97,802.001,810.576,"There's also so much public anger, fear, and disappointment with the Democrats refusal to build the movement we need to game back our rights.",41,,
152,0.97,810.576,816.182,People want a fighting movement against the far right Supreme Court.,41,,
153,0.97,816.182,819.285,Traveling to Seattle and finding somewhere to stay is expensive enough.,41,,
154,0.97,819.285,825.758,We need to expand the city abortion fund to include Nonresidents by increasing the Amazon tax.,41,,
155,0.97,825.758,830.596,Abortion shouldn't be only accessible to those who can afford it.,41,,
156,0.97,830.596,830.863,I urge --,41,,
157,0.97,830.863,835.167,Next Speaker is Barbara Phinney.,42,,

159,0.97,837.503,850.115,I'm a delegate to the Mlk labor Council for Asge local 3197 representing the bargaining unit including the physicians of the Seattle via medical center.,43,,
160,0.97,850.115,862.595,Both local and county labor Federation have passed resolutions to defend abortion and Lgbtq rights in support efforts to get it codified because these are workers issues.,43,,
161,0.97,862.595,871.971,So I urge all Councilmembers to publicly support Councilmember Sawant's upcoming legislation to make Seattle an abortion rights sanctuary city.,43,,
162,0.97,871.971,895.628,"This legislation would prevent Seattle police from processing arrest warrants related to Anti- abortion laws around the country providing sanctuary for patients, their MDS and other care providers, executive directors by the governor and Mayor are good but workers have been waiting 50 years for Democrats to codify the right to abortion care and bodily autonomy.",43,,
163,0.97,895.628,898.197,And now it's law.,43,,
164,0.97,898.197,901.7,Sawant's legislation would ensure abortion --,43,,

194,0.97,1000.532,1004.97,It's time to earn our reputation that we have in Seattle being a progressive city.,58,,
195,0.97,1004.97,1009.308,I realize both the governor and the Mayor have announced executive action.,58,,
196,0.97,1009.308,1016.315,"But as we saw with Roe V wade, executive action and a lot of talking don't keep us safe.",58,,
197,0.97,1016.315,1022.087,And don't keep women's bodies safe.,58,,
198,0.97,1022.087,1022.388,Thank you.,58,,
199,0.97,1022.388,1029.395,Next Speaker is Sara Lloyd.,59,,

213,0.97,1050.682,1056.922,I urge all Democrats on the city Council to support Councilmember Sawant's legislation to make Seattle an abortion rights sanctuary city.,65,,
214,0.97,1056.922,1064.229,"While governor Insley and Mayor Harrell announced executive action along similar lines as this legislation, these executive actions are not enough.",65,,
215,0.97,1064.229,1072.271,The repeal of Roe V wade shows that we must be vigilant and protect the rights that we have won through mass struggle and we need every extra security to keep them in place.,65,,
216,0.97,1072.271,1078.31,The Democrats on a national level have had 50 years and three different Vetos to majorities to codify Roe V wade into law.,65,,
217,0.97,1078.31,1079.411,And they didn't do anything.,65,,
218,0.97,1079.411,1080.446,And look where we are now.,65,,
219,0.97,1080.446,1082.881,We need more than words from Democrats.,65,,
220,0.97,1082.881,1084.55,We need action.,65,,
221,0.97,1084.55,1086.452,70% of Americans support abortion rights.,65,,
222,0.97,1086.452,1092.958,Tens of thousands have protested across the country at its repeal and thousands have signed a local petition in support of this legislation.,65,,
223,0.97,1092.958,1104.069,I urge all Democrats to publicly support Councilmember Sawant's legislation to make Seattle an abortion rights sanctuary city.,65,,
224,0.97,1105.137,1111.043,Our next Speaker is Sara Lloyd.,66,,
225,0.97,1111.043,1111.31,Sara?,67,,

229,0.97,1114.713,1117.149,My name is Sara Lloyd.,70,,
230,0.97,1117.149,1127.726,I'm here to provide public support for Councilmember Sawant's initiative to make Seattle an abortion haven and to provide free abortion care.,70,,
231,0.97,1127.726,1129.294,Abortion is health care.,70,,
232,0.97,1129.294,1134.8,"But it's also social, economic, gender, and racial justice.",70,,
233,0.97,1134.8,1135.167,It's important.,70,,
234,0.97,1135.167,1136.635,We need it.,70,,
235,0.97,1136.635,1140.939,We need to help defray the cost for working people everywhere.,70,,
236,0.97,1140.939,1143.742,And provide a safe place for people to get the care they need.,70,,
237,0.97,1143.742,1156.588,It's a tangible way for Councilmembers to show that women embracing people who live and work in Seattle are supported by their city and that bodily autonomy is something they respect.,70,,
238,0.97,1156.588,1157.923,Thank you.,70,,
239,0.97,1157.923,1169.968,Our next Speaker is Ellen Anderson.,71,,

244,0.97,1180.179,1182.281,But maybe muted on her phone.,75,,
245,0.97,1183.115,1186.818,Ellen you need to push Star 6.,76,,
246,0.97,1187.953,1188.186,Okay.,77,,
247,0.97,1188.186,1189.321,Can folks hear me in,77,,
248,0.97,1189.321,1189.555,Yes.,78,,
249,0.97,1189.555,1192.858,We can hear you now.,78,,
250,0.97,1192.858,1193.125,Cool.,79,,
251,0.97,1193.125,1194.026,"Hi, I'm Ellen.",79,,
252,0.97,1194.026,1195.394,I live in beacon Hill.,79,,
253,0.97,1195.394,1198.13,I'm a student at Seattle central.,79,,
254,0.97,1198.13,1209.274,I urge all Democrats on the city Council to loudly and proudly publicly support Councilmember Sawant's upcoming legislation to make Seattle an abortion right sanctuary city.,79,,
255,0.97,1209.274,1219.384,"You know, thousands of people have protested against this attack, it's clear that the public interest Massively supports defending reproductive rights.",79,,
256,0.97,1219.384,1233.432,Under the pressure of these mass protests from Councilmember Sawant's bill that governor Insley and Mayor Harrell have announced executive actions along the lines of the bill from Councilmember Sawant's progressive labor unions and Socialist alternatives.,79,,
257,0.97,1233.432,1236.034,But the executive orders don't carry the weight of the law.,79,,
258,0.97,1236.034,1246.244,And it can be undone on a whim just like Roe was struck down due to the failure of the deputies who had 50 years to codify legal abortion and failed to do so.,79,,
259,0.97,1246.244,1257.723,So I want to be fully clear that these executive orders to not give an excuse to city council Democrats to not support Sawant's bill.,79,,
260,0.97,1257.723,1264.763,Our next Speaker is Nyree Cocurian.,80,,
261,0.97,1264.763,1265.897,Can you hear me?,81,,
262,0.97,1265.897,1266.431,Yes.,82,,
263,0.97,1266.431,1271.937,We can hear you.,83,,
264,0.97,1271.937,1278.076,I see her.,84,,
265,0.97,1278.076,1279.011,"Nyrie, go ahead.",84,,
266,0.97,1279.011,1287.686,She might have muted herself by pressed Star 6. Nyrie you want to press Star 6 and start over.,85,,
267,0.97,1287.686,1292.524,Can you hear me now I?,86,,
268,0.97,1292.524,1292.958,Yes.,87,,
269,0.97,1292.958,1294.76,I hope you start my clock over.,87,,
270,0.97,1294.76,1300.098,My name is Nyrie I'm a member of Sbiu 775.,87,,
271,0.97,1300.098,1305.771,I support Councilmember Sawant's legislation to make Seattle an abortion rights sanctuary.,87,,
272,0.97,1305.771,1308.674,We have 50 years as a nation to codify Roe.,87,,
273,0.97,1308.674,1312.778,We've had three Democratic Presidents with veto proof majority.,87,,
274,0.97,1312.778,1316.682,In action by the Democrats brought us to where we are today.,87,,
275,0.97,1316.682,1321.319,Our mostly Democratic city council should not follow that tradition.,87,,
276,0.97,1321.319,1327.659,In okay of 1999 I made a heart breaking choice to terminate a very much wanted pregnancy due to fetal defect.,87,,
277,0.97,1327.659,1334.599,The only doctorate my local clinic who could provide this service refused to do so because of his religious beliefs.,87,,
278,0.97,1334.599,1337.636,I had to travel 90 minutes each way to Seattle for three days.,87,,
279,0.97,1337.636,1340.205,Luckily I could go home each day.,87,,
280,0.97,1340.205,1340.672,It wasn't convenient.,87,,
281,0.97,1340.672,1342.441,But it was doable.,87,,
282,0.97,1342.441,1348.58,I can imagine women coming from out of state will have to go through with the added burden of finding and paying for a place to stay.,87,,
283,0.97,1348.58,1359.324,"I hope that we can be a place where people can find safe, legal abortions whether it's for unwanted or wanted pregnancies.",87,,
284,0.97,1359.324,1363.095,Our next Speaker is Sonja.,88,,
285,0.97,1363.095,1365.731,Sonja?,89,,
286,0.97,1365.731,1366.798,Hi.,90,,
287,0.97,1366.798,1367.966,Actually it's Sonya.,90,,
288,0.97,1367.966,1369.401,I'm a working mom.,90,,
289,0.97,1369.401,1377.209,And I urge all the Democrats on the city Council to publicly support this up coming legislation.,90,,
290,0.97,1377.209,1379.678,Put forward by Councilmember Sawant.,90,,
291,0.97,1379.678,1381.646,We've seen thousands protest against this attack.,90,,
292,0.97,1381.646,1391.89,And it's because of the pressure of these kind of movements that make governor Insley and Harrell put forward those executive actions.,90,,
293,0.97,1391.89,1394.893,And the pressure of this bill.,90,,
294,0.97,1394.893,1398.53,We've seen the Democrats do basically nothing to fig back.,90,,
295,0.97,1398.53,1403.001,And I'm seeing a lot of complacent thinking that executive orders will just solve this.,90,,
296,0.97,1403.001,1404.302,They won't as people have said.,90,,
297,0.97,1404.302,1406.304,They don't carry the weigh of law.,90,,
298,0.97,1406.304,1413.945,"You know we could get more Republicans in state Legislature, they will overturn it as soon as they can, absolutely.",90,,
299,0.97,1413.945,1423.255,And it's really important to note that thousands of people all ready have signed the petition in support of this legislation.,90,,
300,0.97,1423.255,1423.722,Okay that's my time.,90,,
301,0.97,1423.722,1424.623,And I'm supporting it.,90,,
302,0.97,1424.623,1431.763,Asking you to publicly support it and vote yes to make landlords disclose the rents they charge.,90,,
303,0.97,1431.763,1435.167,If they're not gouging.,90,,
304,0.97,1435.167,1437.536,Our next Speaker is Eve Mets.,90,,
305,0.97,1437.536,1439.371,Hi name is eva Mets.,91,,
306,0.97,1439.371,1450.382,I'm a Caregiver and member of Sciu 775 and I'm calling to urge city Councilmembers to support Councilmember Sawant's upcoming legislation to make Seattle an abortion right sanctuary city.,91,,
307,0.97,1450.382,1454.586,Without it protests following the Roe V wade repeal here in Seattle and at pride.,91,,
308,0.97,1454.586,1459.057,And there was just so much overwhelming support for Councilmember Sawant's legislation.,91,,
309,0.97,1459.057,1461.426,It was so easy to collect petition signatures.,91,,
310,0.97,1461.426,1466.665,And I think the 4600 signatures in just over a week really speaks to this support.,91,,
311,0.97,1466.665,1477.676,"Even if the lion share of the blame for overturning Roe lies with the far right and the Republican party, the Democratic party has been complicit and has really failed to fight over decades.",91,,
312,0.97,1477.676,1480.111,They haven't rallied women.,91,,
313,0.97,1480.111,1491.79,"Lgbtq people, union members, workers, since Roe was overturned and really much less prepared them for an actual fight to regain the left ground and defend against more far reaching losses in the future.",91,,
314,0.97,1491.79,1498.296,There's a hunger amongst tens of thousands of people for a concrete response to the Supreme Court's decision.,91,,
315,0.97,1498.296,1503.201,And all Councilmembers who have spoken in support of abortion health care have an obligation.,91,,
316,0.97,1503.201,1510.342,Our next Speaker is Matthew.,92,,
317,0.97,1510.342,1511.243,Hi.,93,,
318,0.97,1511.243,1512.277,I'm Matthew.,93,,

320,0.97,1513.445,1521.453,And I want to urge city Council to support Councilmember Sawant's upcoming legislation to make Seattle an abortion right sanctuary city.,93,,
321,0.97,1521.453,1526.625,People have noted thousands in our area have protested the Supreme Court's attack.,93,,
322,0.97,1526.625,1530.762,An attack in Contra ticks to the 70% of Americans who support legal abortion.,93,,
323,0.97,1530.762,1546.478,This legislation leaves the same approach used by Seattle voters in the 2003 initiative to reduce the number of marijuana related prosecutions and prevent Seattle police from processing arrest warrants related to anti-abortion laws around the country for patients and providers.,93,,
324,0.97,1546.478,1554.085,Further more we need to support and rally Lgbtq people in this fight as well pushing back against the growing Criminalization of Trans people.,93,,
325,0.97,1554.085,1558.156,And remove obstacles to gender affirming care.,93,,
326,0.97,1558.156,1558.323,Thanks.,93,,
327,0.97,1558.857,1568.934,Our next Speaker is Anita Shoemaker.,94,,

331,0.97,1575.54,1575.84,Shoemaker.,97,,
332,0.97,1575.84,1579.844,And I'm a concerned citizen and mom of West Seattle.,97,,
333,0.97,1579.844,1587.586,I'm here today to urge support of Councilmember Sawant's abortion sanctuary city legislation.,97,,
334,0.97,1587.586,1595.527,"I'm concerned that since Roe has been overturned, oppressive Legislations have surfaced far and wide.",97,,
335,0.97,1595.527,1602.0,Some go so far as to threaten prosecution for events outside of their jurisdiction.,97,,
336,0.97,1602.0,1609.908,We as a community can stand against the oppression and over arching reach by protecting those that seek abortion care in our city.,97,,
337,0.97,1609.908,1614.446,Whether they live here or not.,97,,
338,0.97,1614.446,1614.746,Thank you.,97,,
339,0.97,1614.746,1624.189,Our next Speaker is Sally Soriano.,98,,
340,0.97,1624.189,1624.589,Hi.,99,,
341,0.97,1624.589,1626.625,I'm Sally Soriano.,99,,
342,0.97,1626.625,1628.86,Educator in the 32nd legislative district.,99,,
343,0.97,1628.86,1642.44,I stand in solidarity with Councilmember Sawant who is proposing legislation to make Seattle a sanctuary city for abortion care and for though victimized and intimidated by outstanding warrants for abortion related offenses.,99,,
344,0.97,1642.44,1652.35,So want's legislation would mean that Seattle police would refuse to assist out of state police searching for women who traveled here seeking abortion services or refuge.,99,,
345,0.97,1652.35,1661.893,This legislation is absolutely necessary and has the power to change the political landscape just as the fight for $15 an hour did.,99,,
346,0.97,1661.893,1672.037,I will advocate for other cities and States to also pass similar legislation that would outlaw police cooperation and provide this legal refuge for women.,99,,
347,0.97,1672.037,1676.508,"Please support this legislation, thank you.",99,,
348,0.97,1676.508,1686.217,Next Speaker is skip Knox.,100,,
349,0.97,1686.217,1687.819,He's not present.,100,,
350,0.97,1687.819,1694.692,I'm moving forward with Madeleine Olson.,100,,
351,0.97,1694.692,1697.062,"Hi, can you hear me?",101,,
352,0.97,1697.062,1697.295,Yes.,102,,
353,0.97,1697.295,1698.129,Hi there.,103,,
354,0.97,1698.129,1699.497,My name is Madeleine.,103,,
355,0.97,1699.497,1709.674,I'm a Renter in green Lake and a member of UFCW 3000 today I'm calling on the Democrats on the Council to sign Councilmember Sawant's legislation to make seal an abortion sanctuary city.,103,,
356,0.97,1709.674,1713.845,It's not enough to wait for a direct attack on reproductive rights here.,103,,
357,0.97,1713.845,1716.147,We need these protections now to be in place.,103,,
358,0.97,1716.147,1729.327,"I've heard folks talking about this executive order from the governor, you know, we have--this is preventing the state patrol from prosecuting abortion providers fleeing from other states.",103,,
359,0.97,1729.327,1730.729,It's not applying to the Seattle police.,103,,
360,0.97,1730.729,1738.803,This is why we need the bill in Seattle as Whelm as others have said Harrell's executive order is no guaranteed protections that we need.,103,,
361,0.97,1738.803,1743.741,On top of passing the legislation to provide protections we need to pass the funding to have the abortions in the budget.,103,,
362,0.97,1743.741,1748.68,"So those fleeing in need of the abortions can get them, right?",103,,
363,0.97,1748.68,1754.085,This is what standing up for reproductive rights looks like.,103,,
364,0.97,1754.085,1757.489,Not just saying your devastated and not supporting us materially.,103,,
365,0.97,1757.489,1760.525,You need to have the material support for your Wores.,103,,

370,0.97,1774.672,1781.746,I urge all Democrats to publicly support Councilmember Sawant's upcoming legislation to make Seattle an abortion rights sanctuary city.,105,,
371,0.97,1781.746,1783.381,Without delays and without watering down.,105,,
372,0.97,1783.381,1787.886,And also to expand the Amazon tax to fund abortions on demand.,105,,
373,0.97,1787.886,1799.964,This historic loss of Roe expose once again the complete failure of the Democratic party to show political will when it comes to defending attacks on working people.,105,,
374,0.97,1799.964,1814.179,The far right minority that exploited the Democrats in their lack of a movement building approach to defend Roe is determined to pass National abortion bans and a hard won Lgbtq rights as well.,105,,
375,0.97,1814.179,1821.92,"Given the Democrat's track record, working people can have no faith at all that Democrats will fight effectively.",105,,
376,0.97,1821.92,1825.59,If this body fails to point to the legislation.,105,,
377,0.97,1825.59,1831.329,And points to the executive orders of Harrell and Insley which can easily be overturned.,105,,

382,0.97,1849.614,1860.491,I call on the Seattle city Council to expand social supports to cover Daycare so people may be given the real choice that's been denied which is to grow a family.,107,,
383,0.97,1860.491,1865.063,I'm disappointed to see Councilmember Sawant align herself with corporate interest.,107,,
384,0.97,1865.063,1904.469,"That women are fearful of losing jobs due to pregnancy as a symptom of corporate culture that depends on cheap labor not on workers earning E to sup Pofort a family instead of taxing Amazon to pay for abortions, Councilmember Sawant should be calling on tax collections to provide free, safe, effective and reversible contraception, and for employees wanting a family, prenatal care and maternity leave and living wages if we want to maintain an expanded labor force, employers should offer subsidies to pay for Daycare, I ask Council do not make Seattle a sanctuary city where our citizens pay for the decisions of other states.",107,,
385,0.97,1904.469,1914.879,Our next Speaker is Kristen Monahan.,108,,

390,0.97,1930.028,1931.93,Embryos and fetuses are human beings.,109,,
391,0.97,1931.93,1946.778,No denial will take away from this scientific fact abortion is the biggest human genocide that's ever existed before bigger than all other wars and Genocides combined because Preborn humans are killed through abortion each year worldwide.,109,,
392,0.97,1946.778,1952.65,"If all humans deny this basic right, they are just human beings just like us, it would not change this fact.",109,,
393,0.97,1952.65,1957.021,Abortion destroys and kills the bodies and lives of humans.,109,,
394,0.97,1957.021,1961.025,Their bodies often get torn apart in the process.,109,,
395,0.97,1961.025,1962.894,And the most vulnerable humans at that.,109,,
396,0.97,1962.894,1966.597,It deals with the systemic exploitation of their mothers.,109,,
397,0.97,1966.597,1980.578,"Pregnant people get told their children are not children, abortions don't kill anyone, and they can't be parents in whatever situations they're in because the abortion industry wants to make money by killing their children for a profit.",109,,
398,0.97,1980.578,1982.447,It's inherently capitalist in nature.,109,,
399,0.97,1982.447,1988.052,Our next Speaker is Olivia.,110,,

403,0.97,2001.866,2019.217,This will protect people and their reproductive rights who are in and out of state residents and prevent police PR processing abortion law arrest WARNS protecting doctors and care providers millions of Americans are furious and stunned at the dismantling of Roe V wade by the right wing.,110,,
404,0.97,2019.217,2025.356,We know the Supreme Court decision is in contradiction to the majority of working American people who support legal abortion.,110,,

406,0.97,2027.458,2035.299,"Although the governor and Mayor announced executive action along the lines of the bill, executive orders are not law and can be undone.",110,,
407,0.97,2035.299,2044.876,It's very clear that there's no excuse to the city council Democrats to not support Councilmember Sawant's bill.,110,,
408,0.97,2044.876,2053.518,They've obtained 4600 signatures from Seattle's working people and I expect the Democratic party Councilmembers understand how much support there is for Sawant's legislation.,110,,

422,0.97,2100.565,2108.306,The public petition Garnered overwhelming public support with the information that includes the Amazon tax to fund abortion in Seattle.,113,,
423,0.97,2108.306,2118.683,"The people of Seattle are friends, family, and peers in other states need to know there's a law in place that provides health care we rely on.",113,,
424,0.97,2118.683,2123.321,Especially when an influx of patients will put a strain on an under Resourced service.,113,,

461,0.97,2282.947,2287.952,I object to the appeal to the impact on minority populations.,122,,
462,0.97,2287.952,2295.393,Abortion has been used to decrease the minority population of which I am one.,122,,
463,0.97,2295.393,2300.464,Margaret Sanger was explicit in this idea in 1939.,122,,

488,0.97,2412.51,2424.188,"The only sanctuary is in this case a sacrificial stone, which is Seattle, to sacrifice babies.",127,,
489,0.97,2424.188,2429.293,"Now, Insley and company, all the others all the way down, should be recalled.",127,,

502,0.97,2498.062,2504.501,Because Roe V wade was not the first attack on our civil liberties.,130,,
503,0.97,2504.501,2511.342,And sitting judges have made it clear that it will not be the last.,130,,

514,0.97,2553.284,2557.221,And we could still barely afford the $500 for the procedure.,132,,
515,0.97,2557.221,2562.459,Much less the thousands of dollars we would have needed to travel had abortion been banned back then.,132,,
516,0.97,2562.459,2565.763,I'm proud that I made the right decision for my life.,132,,
517,0.97,2565.763,2571.001,And that I'm now where I am today because I was able to pay that $500 and get an abortion.,132,,
518,0.97,2571.001,2585.916,And that's why I believe it's imperative to not only Seattle a sanctuary city but provide funding for patients who will not be able to afford their own abortion health care in the States they're currently living.,132,,
519,0.97,2585.916,2586.216,Thank you.,132,,

533,0.97,2676.24,2682.746,I also support the call for funding as it's critical to expand abortion access in Seattle.,136,,
534,0.97,2682.746,2684.581,We only have 19 clinics statewide.,136,,
535,0.97,2684.581,2687.251,And that's down from 33 in 2014.,136,,
536,0.97,2687.251,2692.556,So this is especially critical for central and Eastern Washington as well.,136,,
537,0.97,2692.556,2698.595,And it will become even more strained with nose seeking abortion coming in from other states.,136,,
538,0.97,2698.595,2712.476,"So I also urge the Council to use your power to call on governor Insley and the state Legislature to provide more funding, Governor Insley pledged a million dollars but much more is needed.",136,,
539,0.97,2712.476,2716.08,So I urge you to look--to help also statewide.,136,,
540,0.97,2716.08,2721.585,And also to help those who are trying --,136,,
541,0.97,2721.585,2729.96,"Thank you, our next Speaker is Megan Murphy.",137,,
542,0.97,2729.96,2732.096,Hi my name is Megan Murphy.,138,,
543,0.97,2732.096,2734.431,I'm a member of radical women.,138,,
544,0.97,2734.431,2739.87,And I'm in support of making Seattle a sanctuary city.,138,,
545,0.97,2739.87,2749.279,I literally fled Sioux City Iowa where abortion rights are greatly restricted and it has a far right climate.,138,,
546,0.97,2749.279,2757.387,I went to the police thinking I was being stalked and I was labeled as a schizophrenic and 90 days later my parental rights were terminated completely.,138,,
547,0.97,2757.387,2761.558,So women need to be in place where is their health care and concerns are taken seriously.,138,,
548,0.97,2761.558,2770.734,If they complain of any kind of assault or of wanting to be rid of a pregnancy they don't want it needs to be taken seriously that our no means no.,138,,
549,0.97,2770.734,2773.137,And I Miss my son horribly.,138,,
550,0.97,2773.137,2775.172,I haven't seen him for eleven years.,138,,
551,0.97,2775.172,2779.109,And it's because the state interfered in a way that was so punitive.,138,,
552,0.97,2779.109,2785.482,And the state needs to be supportive of women's feelings and women's rights and all rights.,138,,
553,0.97,2785.482,2787.618,People that are Lgbtq all of them.,138,,

561,0.97,2825.522,2839.636,"And I don't get, how are you going to--Oh, a sanctuary city, and I think of a sanctuary as a church sanctuary, and thank God we can go up in there and pray at any time.",140,,

563,0.97,2842.139,2845.709,You want to make provisions for everything.,140,,
564,0.97,2845.709,2849.313,I think you made it a sanctuary city for immigrants.,140,,
565,0.97,2849.313,2854.718,But you ain't dealing with that Jim Crow sign down there that says black lives matter.,140,,
566,0.97,2854.718,2857.02,Let there be no questions.,140,,
567,0.97,2857.02,2865.562,How is it so simplified to sit up there and put something on the agenda for other people but our lives are not sacred?,140,,

709,0.97,3509.806,3514.143,It takes six votes to pass the bill and over ride the Mayor's veto.,176,,
710,0.97,3514.143,3526.99,"Councilmembers received a memo from central staff, I think you received a couple of them last Wednesday outlining the procedure ts I'll remind Councilmembers of this procedure.",176,,
711,0.97,3526.99,3531.494,The reconsideration of Council bill 120325 is now pending before the Council.,176,,
712,0.97,3531.494,3539.802,Are there any comments on the bill?,176,,
713,0.97,3539.802,3540.837,Councilmember Pedersen.,176,,
714,0.97,3540.837,3543.573,"Thank you, Council President.",177,,
715,0.97,3543.573,3557.353,"I appreciate that a Cosponsorship of this bill with Councilmember Morales and as you mentioned, a majority of the city council approved Council bill 120325 to collect basic rental data.",177,,
716,0.97,3557.353,3559.622,City Hall has been lacking for years.,177,,
717,0.97,3559.622,3567.864,Data we need urgently now on the eve of considering massive land use and zoning changes through a required comprehensive plan.,177,,
718,0.97,3567.864,3573.202,As one of the sponsors of the bill I outlined several reasons to support the bill originally.,177,,
719,0.97,3573.202,3577.74,We need the data to prevent displacement of vulnerable residents.,177,,
720,0.97,3577.74,3593.289,"The data is vital before we make changes to the comprehensive plan to impacts zoning and housing policies, the current census track data and Rentaller is Vaios on vacant units lack the vital details on existing rents at specific locations.",177,,
721,0.97,3593.289,3596.392,And we all ready considered alternatives to this bill.,177,,
722,0.97,3596.392,3600.229,But those alternatives are inadequate.,177,,
723,0.97,3600.229,3606.569,The data can validate affordable benefits of smaller mom and pop landlords.,177,,
724,0.97,3606.569,3614.444,"Also, Indeference to active landlords which Express concerns about the concept, the bill all ready included important accommodations.",177,,
725,0.97,3614.444,3620.183,A research University would receive the raw rental data instead of the city government directly.,177,,
726,0.97,3620.183,3621.417,The requirement would sunset in three years.,177,,
727,0.97,3621.417,3626.956,So it was just a temporary bill needed at a crucial time in our decision making.,177,,
728,0.97,3626.956,3631.661,Opponents of the bill then raised concerns about timing and cost.,177,,
729,0.97,3631.661,3637.634,The bill was amended further which ended up addressing those concerns.,177,,
730,0.97,3637.634,3640.069,The city's executive departments would be in the driver's seat.,177,,
731,0.97,3640.069,3651.214,Nothing would happen until the executive executes a contract with the research University after a Exre conservative request for proposals and the Rfp could manage the cost.,177,,
732,0.97,3651.214,3662.959,Specifically the Council bill adopted was amended to state that effective three months of the date--excuse me effective three months from the date contract described if the subsection is executed.,177,,
733,0.97,3662.959,3667.63,The information that was requested will be submitted later.,177,,
734,0.97,3667.63,3667.997,Twice annually.,177,,
735,0.97,3667.997,3674.337,So the timing issue Wu solved with that.,177,,
736,0.97,3674.337,3680.81,"I also want to point out that when the bill was vetoed, I offered additional supports for the bill.",177,,
737,0.97,3680.81,3688.484,And the bottom line is I Urnled at least one of the four Councilmembers who voted against it to join the majority so this bill becomes law.,177,,
738,0.97,3688.484,3695.091,The additional supports are that rental registries like this are increasingly common in the United States.,177,,
739,0.97,3695.091,3695.925,Seattle is behind.,177,,
740,0.97,3695.925,3699.429,We are not progressive on this issue.,177,,
741,0.97,3699.429,3707.036,Long standing laws requiring rent roles with rental data information all ready exists in other cities such as New York City.,177,,
742,0.97,3707.036,3712.275,"More over, many California cities have implemented these programs over the past few years.",177,,
743,0.97,3712.275,3720.95,A 2019 report examined eight rental housing Registry programs including three that all ready require the rent amount be provided.,177,,
744,0.97,3720.95,3727.924,A more recent February 2022 news article highlighted that 16 different cities in California are moving ahead with this.,177,,
745,0.97,3727.924,3732.361,Not waiting for the state Legislature to act.,177,,
746,0.97,3732.361,3736.265,Costs are dramatically lower than what opponents claimed.,177,,
747,0.97,3736.265,3763.159,"Based on the actual experiences of these other cities, the fact that we're simply adding on to an existing housing Registry, Seattle's rental registration and inspection ordinance, that all ready enforces the collection of data, and we would be using competitive requests for proposals, the cost add, the collection of research components at CB 120325 could be $125,000 a year.",177,,
748,0.97,3763.159,3771.4,"The two departments that should want this data and Juan us to have this data, they received budget increases last year.",177,,
749,0.97,3771.4,3777.673,And the executives required to have this information in doing the competent hen Assistive plan proposals.,177,,
750,0.97,3777.673,3781.944,To this bill would have enabled them to get the data they need.,177,,
751,0.97,3781.944,3795.324,"And the University that would be chosen via a competitive Rfp would be doing the bulk of the work, data entry, sorting, the mapping, affordable housing projects, to make well informed decisions.",177,,
752,0.97,3795.324,3796.559,There was a 2 Million-Dollar estimate.,177,,
753,0.97,3796.559,3798.194,But that was over the Three- year period.,177,,
754,0.97,3798.194,3805.968,And it was based on asking one Realestate center how much money would they want to do this?,177,,
755,0.97,3805.968,3812.575,And that is not necessarily the best way to get an affordable result.,177,,
756,0.97,3812.575,3814.177,The competitive Rfp process would get that result.,177,,
757,0.97,3814.177,3817.914,There was also a 5 Million- dollar estimate that was mentioned.,177,,
758,0.97,3817.914,3822.718,But that was if we were to set up the Rrio program from scratch.,177,,
759,0.97,3822.718,3826.222,So that was not a reliable estimate.,177,,
760,0.97,3826.222,3831.327,"Also, this bill I had the not charge landlords the cost to run this system.",177,,
761,0.97,3831.327,3835.364,Landlords do pay for the Rrio all ready.,177,,
762,0.97,3835.364,3840.102,There could have been an option to increase that by $4 a unit.,177,,
763,0.97,3840.102,3843.105,That would have yielded Lenity of funds to run this program.,177,,
764,0.97,3843.105,3845.208,But we didn't choose to do it that way.,177,,
765,0.97,3845.208,3846.042,But we could have.,177,,
766,0.97,3846.042,3853.282,"In other words, cost is really not an appropriate rational to vote against the bill in my opinion.",177,,
767,0.97,3853.282,3861.357,So bottom line is there are plenty of reasons to support Council bill 120325 as the majority of our legislative branch all ready did.,177,,
768,0.97,3861.357,3863.659,So I urge a Yes vote again today.,177,,
769,0.97,3863.659,3864.093,Thank you.,177,,
770,0.97,3864.093,3866.195,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,178,,
771,0.97,3866.195,3869.465,Before I go to Councilmember Morales who is a cosponsor.,178,,
772,0.97,3869.465,3870.199,Then Councilmember Sawant.,178,,
773,0.97,3870.199,3880.876,I want to remind the public when we voted on May 31st the vote was 5-4. Councilmember Morales.,178,,
774,0.97,3880.876,3882.411,I can't hear you.,179,,
775,0.97,3882.411,3882.712,Yeah.,180,,
776,0.97,3882.712,3885.114,Here we go.,180,,
777,0.97,3885.114,3886.582,Sorry about that.,180,,
778,0.97,3886.582,3890.219,"Thank you, colleagues, and thank you Councilmember Pedersen.",180,,
779,0.97,3890.219,3892.989,I'm proud to have cosponsored this legislation.,180,,
780,0.97,3892.989,3904.233,And I'm disappointed that the Mayor decided to veto a bill that would actually allow us to collect real information on rent trends for the first time ever.,180,,
781,0.97,3904.233,3920.149,"As the city continues to become more affordable, we as policymakers need data about our rental market that tell us the rate at which rent is increasing in our city, and we shouldn't be reliant on private for profit corporations to do that work for us.",180,,
782,0.97,3920.149,3923.252,We know that Seattle isn't affordable.,180,,
783,0.97,3923.252,3927.59,But we don't really know the rate at which rents are skyrocketing right now.,180,,
784,0.97,3927.59,3932.161,We don't know which units are seeing the biggest increases.,180,,
785,0.97,3932.161,3939.669,We don't know if there is a ceiling to the kind of rent increases we're seeing now.,180,,
786,0.97,3939.669,3942.538,My office worked with Councilmember Pedersen on this legislation.,180,,
787,0.97,3942.538,3953.549,We believe it has the potential to provide us with data that we're currently lacking and it has the potential [coughing] excuse me.,180,,
788,0.97,3953.549,3953.849,Pardon me.,180,,
789,0.97,3953.849,3958.554,It has the potential to put a tremendous am of power into the hands of tenants.,180,,
790,0.97,3958.554,3963.225,Shifting the scale towards something more balanced between landlords and tenants.,180,,
791,0.97,3963.225,3969.065,This is an opportunity that tenants in cities with rent rolls like Chicago and New York all ready have.,180,,
792,0.97,3969.065,3978.541,This could mean for tenants that they finally have the ability to make an informed decision and to make a choice between units when they're searching for a new home.,180,,
793,0.97,3978.541,3984.013,Something that landlords have been able to do with background checks on tenants for decades.,180,,
794,0.97,3984.013,3989.819,What this means for tenants is they'll know who is hiding behind Llcs that own the LLC.,180,,
795,0.97,3989.819,3991.821,That own their building.,180,,
796,0.97,3991.821,4007.636,And that means that they can go directly to the person or persons who are responsible for keeping their unit habitable if repair requests are not being fulfilled.,180,,
797,0.97,4007.636,4013.943,Data that shows the need for us to join the rest of the West Coast and pass rent control at the state and city level.,180,,
798,0.97,4013.943,4026.422,And finally this mean for tenants that we would finally have concrete data that Dispels the illusion that private market trickle down economics is the solution to our Affordability crisis.,180,,
799,0.97,4026.422,4032.728,Data that could give us the extra push to invest in high quality abundant publicly owned social housing.,180,,
800,0.97,4032.728,4039.969,"So for me, this legislation isn't necessarily about land use decision it is a may or may not happen in the next two years.",180,,
801,0.97,4039.969,4044.073,It's about nothing short of giving tenants the opportunity to stay in Seattle.,180,,
802,0.97,4044.073,4047.209,Something that we know many of them are Looing quickly.,180,,
803,0.97,4047.209,4054.95,I urge my colleagues to vote yes to over ride this shortsighted veto and to give tenants the opportunities that they deserve.,180,,
804,0.97,4054.95,4059.655,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",181,,
805,0.97,4059.655,4060.122,Councilmember Sawant.,181,,
806,0.97,4060.122,4061.824,"Thank you, Council President Juarez.",182,,
807,0.97,4061.824,4074.303,"As I said when this bill first came for vote to the city Council, this bill requires landlords disclose the rent they charge to so policymakers can have accurate objective data.",182,,
808,0.97,4074.303,4081.911,"To be clear, this bill going into effect will not make rental homes more affordable, it will simply collect data.",182,,
809,0.97,4081.911,4093.088,"But it is outrageous that the landlord lobby who claimed the charge affordable rents have called repeatedly into public comment in the past, opposition to the city having objective data.",182,,
810,0.97,4093.088,4098.828,It will be good to have more data about the rent landlords charge.,182,,
811,0.97,4098.828,4105.401,And it's ironic landlords have simultaneously claimed they charge low rent.,182,,
812,0.97,4105.401,4110.573,It's extremely telling that the landlord lobby has turned out in opposition to this bill.,182,,
813,0.97,4110.573,4122.751,"As several speakers before and during public comment today said if landlords are not gouging their tenants, why are they so afraid to tell the truth about their rents.",182,,
814,0.97,4122.751,4129.658,And the scandal Mayor Harrell chose to use a rare veto O to so brazenly do the bidding of the landlord lobby.,182,,
815,0.97,4129.658,4135.131,More accurate and complete data will help further confirm what every Renter in Seattle all ready knows.,182,,
816,0.97,4135.131,4144.54,Big landlords and the predatory Realestate markets are Gowning Renters with totally unconscionable rent HIKES.,182,,
817,0.97,4144.54,4154.149,The cost of housing has been set by private equity funds and management corporations rather than what it costs to house people.,182,,
818,0.97,4154.149,4163.392,"While the Realestate balance make millions, working people and the poor are increasing Willly price gouged to have a roof over their heads or they're being pushed into homelessness.",182,,
819,0.97,4163.392,4176.005,"We need to strengthen all aspects of Renter's rights, including strong city wide rent control and a big increase in the Amazon tax to fund an increase expansion of publicly owned social housing.",182,,
820,0.97,4176.005,4186.348,"This bill will only provide more accurate and objective data so if Councilmembers do not support it, it would not stop Renters from fighting for rent control.",182,,
821,0.97,4186.348,4190.819,"Any Councilmember who claims to be data driven, has no excuse to oppose this bill.",182,,
822,0.97,4190.819,4194.857,"I vote yes to make landlords disclose the rent they charge, thank you.",182,,
823,0.97,4194.857,4198.127,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,183,,
824,0.97,4198.127,4204.266,"And finally, Councilmember Herbold.",183,,
825,0.97,4204.266,4208.237,Thank you.,184,,
826,0.97,4208.237,4220.783,I'm trying to adjust my--there we go--take the opportunity to address the need for this sensible data collection.,184,,
827,0.97,4220.783,4240.636,"I'm stretching my head over how the powerful mayoral veto would be used for a bill that's really again, it's merely a data collection tool that's really helpful to us as policymaker, whether or not it's on the Council side of the aisle or on the executive side.",184,,
828,0.97,4240.636,4246.542,I want to just uplift how we have used data in the past.,184,,
829,0.97,4246.542,4250.512,Data specifically about displacement to guide our decisions.,184,,
830,0.97,4250.512,4261.29,"Back in 2015, that was the first major comprehensive plan update that actually included, for the first time ever, a displacement risk analysis.",184,,
831,0.97,4261.29,4284.179,This displacement risk analysis was instrumental to Council's deliberations on the mandatory housing Affordability Rezones and it helped guide us on how to--how to use the--the up zoning tool to add more housing and collect funds to build affordable housing.,184,,
832,0.97,4284.179,4291.22,And it was really again a tool that used data to help drive our decisions.,184,,
833,0.97,4291.22,4307.603,You may recall that on April 5th the city council received I think a really important bit of guidance from the Seattle Commission related specifically to our next major date.,184,,
834,0.97,4307.603,4321.817,And in that Moe memo they wrote they believe they should make anti displacement policies the focus of the next IMRE hen Assistive plan.,184,,
835,0.97,4321.817,4323.218,Comprehensive plan.,184,,
836,0.97,4323.218,4333.228,To drop the decades of the inequitable growth patterns that led to displacement of Bipoc and low income communities.,184,,
837,0.97,4333.228,4342.538,The plan expected in 2024 needs to include anti displacement policies as a central focus of the plan.,184,,
838,0.97,4342.538,4354.249,The city should supplement knowledge shared by communities affected by displacement with improved data tracking of high displacement risk areas and the outcomes of policy actions.,184,,
839,0.97,4354.249,4361.657,I really hope that we can over ride the veto with a majority plus one.,184,,
840,0.97,4361.657,4363.325,Six Councilmembers voting in favor today.,184,,
841,0.97,4363.325,4374.269,And I just want to close out remarks with saying just a little bit of the call to action from share the cities this weekend.,184,,
842,0.97,4374.269,4395.624,They encouraged us by saying let's catch up with other progressive cities and better understand where all affordable housing is located in Seattle so we can finally have the detail data we need to prevent economic displacement as we update our city's policies for a better future thank you.,184,,
843,0.97,4395.624,4397.259,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,185,,
844,0.97,4397.259,4398.861,Before we go to a vote.,185,,
845,0.97,4398.861,4403.432,"Councilmember Pedersen, is there anything you want to say before I make a few comments?",185,,
846,0.97,4403.432,4405.834,Are you good?,185,,
847,0.97,4405.834,4406.068,Yes.,186,,
848,0.97,4406.068,4406.335,Okay.,187,,
849,0.97,4406.335,4411.039,So let me read again the instructions and then we'll go to a vote.,187,,
850,0.97,4411.039,4418.881,The city council will now vote to reconsider passage of Council bill 120325.,187,,
851,0.97,4418.881,4423.685,And to either over ride or sustain the mayoral veto.,187,,
852,0.97,4423.685,4432.861,"During role call, Councilmembers will vote aye or yes to pass the bill and over ride the Mayor's veto.",187,,
853,0.97,4432.861,4436.799,Or vote no not to pass the bill and sustain the veto.,187,,
854,0.97,4436.799,4445.541,"If the vote on the motion does not receive six votes, the bill fails and the veto is sustained.",187,,
855,0.97,4445.541,4456.218,"If the vote on the motion is six or more in favor, the bill passes, the veto is over ridden, and All-Pro visions within the bill go into effect.",187,,
856,0.97,4456.218,4458.954,Are there any other questions?,187,,
857,0.97,4458.954,4463.659,Any other procedural questions on the vote before we go?,187,,
858,0.97,4463.659,4473.068,"So as a reminder, Councilmembers will either vote aye to pass the bill and over ride the Mayor's veto or no to not pass the bill and sustain the veto.",187,,
859,0.97,4473.068,4481.743,Will the clerk please call the role on the passage of Council bill 120325 in consideration of the mayoral veto.,187,,
860,0.97,4481.743,4482.077,Madame lurk?,187,,
861,0.97,4482.077,4484.112,Councilmember Sawant.,188,,
