148,0.97,909.408,912.111,Nice to see you.,25,,
149,0.97,912.111,922.421,I am excited about this appointment . I know you have been working for a very long time about these issues.,25,,
150,0.97,922.421,930.296,I would love to hear a little bit more . I feel like just this week we have been talking about climate issues.,25,,
151,0.97,930.296,937.102,We have been talking about making sure we are addressing climate omissions in the comprehensive plan.,25,,
152,0.97,937.102,940.973,We have been talking about it just last night.,25,,
153,0.97,940.973,943.075,We had a two hour hearing on the parks levy.,25,,
154,0.97,943.075,954.053,"A lot of people calling in about how we the Carbonized buildings, heating conversion, how we make sure we are Prioritizing.",25,,
155,0.97,954.053,965.798,"Reducing carbon emissions through the parks levy, and you mentioned in your Mama or in your answers to some of the questions, the work with the D.O.T.",25,,
156,0.97,965.798,984.55,"And making sure we are increasing transit options and pedestrian and bicycle options so we can continue to reduce emissions and really make that easy choice, which I think we really have to do if we are going to try to move people out of their cars.",25,,
157,0.97,984.55,991.924,I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your role and the role of Osc.,25,,
158,0.97,991.924,1008.374,"All of our departments have a role to play in this, but I see it as you said as your charge to sort of coordinate all of that work and provide the technical assistance and the deeper knowledge for our Department.",25,,
159,0.97,1008.374,1017.015,Can you talk about how you work with the other city departments so that everybody understands what the Department needs to do to Prioritize these changes.,25,,
160,0.97,1017.015,1021.754,That is a great question.,26,,
161,0.97,1021.754,1024.423,There are a few different pieces to how I think that works.,26,,
162,0.97,1024.423,1029.628,I do think that it is a soft power office without a capital budget.,26,,
163,0.97,1029.628,1040.906,"Really and truly a lot of the work is as organizers, supporters, cheerleaders to really move the ball forward with colleagues and other departments.",26,,
164,0.97,1040.906,1048.714,One of the things that I think is really important is to have a clearly articulated bill agenda of what it is we are trying to do.,26,,
165,0.97,1048.714,1050.048,While this is still being refined.,26,,
166,0.97,1050.048,1057.222,I think the basic parameters of that is fostering a green and equitable economy.,26,,
167,0.97,1057.222,1065.898,As we are making these investments making sure we are centering workers and people have left out and that we are building a base of prosperity as we are doing this.,26,,
168,0.97,1065.898,1073.138,"Number two, of course reducing greenhouse gas emissions and doing it in a way that is in keeping with the goals around race and social justice.",26,,
169,0.97,1073.138,1077.042,That is about working with our partners and working with the D.O.T.,26,,
170,0.97,1077.042,1087.953,To put forward plans and programs that are scaled and ambitious that actually get the job done.,26,,
171,0.97,1087.953,1092.324,I can talk more specifically about what those are if there is interest.,26,,
172,0.97,1092.324,1096.628,"The third thing is, climate change is upon us and communities are already suffering from the effects.",26,,
173,0.97,1096.628,1099.498,We need to be relentless in the focus and supporting people right now.,26,,
174,0.97,1099.498,1104.436,That is about making sure that buildings are cooling in ways that are due Carbonized.,26,,
175,0.97,1104.436,1117.249,"It means making sure people have access to tree canopy, cooling, parks, open space, and in the case of climate emergency, places like resiliency hubs.",26,,
176,0.97,1117.249,1122.554,Really figuring out how to make places community responsive.,26,,

178,0.97,1127.726,1136.502,"Doing it in a way that is really centering environmental health, public space and access and public investments in those things.",26,,
179,0.97,1136.502,1148.013,Laying out that clear agenda and what it is we are trying to do is really Foundational to me so we can start to align our efforts across departments.,26,,
180,0.97,1148.013,1155.654,"As we are looking at the parks levy, we can say how is that furthering climate resilience.",26,,
181,0.97,1155.654,1161.36,How are we building into the park spaces where people can be Spayed safe in a climate emergency.,26,,
182,0.97,1161.36,1162.961,How are we Decolonizing our own park facilities.,26,,
183,0.97,1162.961,1172.171,"It also means as we are looking at a comprehensive plan, working with OPC to add a climate element.",26,,
184,0.97,1172.171,1174.64,Thank you to the Council for your interest and direction on that.,26,,
185,0.97,1174.64,1186.785,Really looking at how we are integrating Land-Use choices to be making sure that we are creating the conditions where transportation choices can work.,26,,
186,0.97,1186.785,1192.224,They work best when people are living close to and have access.,26,,
187,0.97,1192.224,1196.194,Really integrating Land-Use.,26,,
188,0.97,1196.194,1209.374,These are concrete examples of how icy and agenda that is clearly articulated bill and translated into the work that various departments are doing.,26,,
189,0.97,1209.374,1226.692,"All the while, making sure that we are a Conduit and responsive to what community wants and SEES and giving the boys an agency to people as we are building out these programs.",26,,

191,0.97,1227.759,1229.061,"I have one more question, if I might.",27,,
192,0.97,1229.061,1232.631,Please go ahead.,28,,
193,0.97,1232.631,1233.465,Thank you so much.,29,,
194,0.97,1233.465,1245.41,I would be Remiss as one of the people that helped to write the local food action plan in 2012 if I did not ask about it.,29,,
195,0.97,1245.41,1247.679,You mentioned in your remarks that you are up dating him.,29,,
196,0.97,1247.679,1250.315,I just want to take a minute to talk about the connection here.,29,,
197,0.97,1250.315,1260.125,As we are talking about heat waves and increased carbon emissions and the need to protect our environment.,29,,
198,0.97,1260.125,1278.71,"There was an article in the paper earlier this week about receiving, preserving food waste and protecting rivers and streams and fish and all of the ways that our indigenous community Foodways are being preserved.",29,,
199,0.97,1278.71,1285.751,"For everybody, Washington is one of the Epicenters of Agriculture.",29,,
200,0.97,1285.751,1297.462,"I know that as we experience climate change across the globe, people are looking to Washington for our food production.",29,,
201,0.97,1297.462,1308.507,"Anyway, I just wanted to ask for a little bit more information about what is being considered or updating that plan and what the Timeline might be.",29,,
202,0.97,1308.507,1310.509,That is a great question.,30,,
203,0.97,1310.509,1312.811,Thank you for your leadership in 2012.,30,,
204,0.97,1312.811,1317.316,That was really groundbreaking work that the city did.,30,,
205,0.97,1317.316,1320.118,Cities have not typically done that at that time.,30,,
206,0.97,1320.118,1322.32,It's now more typical for cities to have food action plans.,30,,
207,0.97,1322.32,1328.093,It really is building on that history and willingness to innovate.,30,,
208,0.97,1328.093,1332.497,"First of all, I will talk briefly about the Timeline.",30,,
209,0.97,1332.497,1344.876,There is a deep community engagement that is happening right now . that will inform the draft recommendations that will be available publicly in the fall and we will be briefing the Council on that.,30,,
210,0.97,1344.876,1352.417,The hope is that the Council would adopt the food action Lan in January.,30,,
211,0.97,1352.417,1364.129,"There is some really exciting things that are going to be part of it, including specific supports of indigenous food culture and Foodways and how we support and integrate that into the city food programming and support.",30,,
212,0.97,1364.129,1379.945,How we are increasing agency and decision-making and power around food access through our support of black and indigenous and other farmers of color within the city.,30,,
213,0.97,1379.945,1391.022,"How are we supporting youth and access to healthy pathways for young people, particularly in our schools.",30,,
214,0.97,1391.022,1406.571,"Around culturally relevant and fresh food, around maintaining food access and some of the barriers around cost, and just improving the program for fresh books.",30,,
215,0.97,1406.571,1412.11,It it has a greater need than we Fund and making sure we have access to more and more retailers.,30,,
216,0.97,1412.11,1420.218,One of the things I am also interested in is access to transportation.,30,,
217,0.97,1420.218,1426.591,How do we make sure people have safe and healthy access to store and shops.,30,,
218,0.97,1426.591,1432.097,Access for vulnerable users of our transportation system and start getting to healthy food access.,30,,
219,0.97,1432.097,1434.199,Those are a few of the pieces that are coming.,30,,
220,0.97,1434.199,1438.937,Thank you.,31,,
221,0.97,1438.937,1444.075,Thank you.,32,,
222,0.97,1444.075,1447.412,Are the questions from other committee members.,32,,
223,0.97,1447.412,1465.096,"I do not see any hands upon the zoom . I will go ahead and ask a question . First of all, thank you for the responses that you send to the questions from my office.",32,,
224,0.97,1465.096,1478.276,"One of the questions I asked was, why do you think leaders including local and national elected officials have failed to take meaningful action to address the climate crisis, despite the most dire warning from scientists.",32,,
225,0.97,1478.276,1481.012,In response he said something I really agree with.,32,,
226,0.97,1481.012,1492.858,"You said in spite of the overwhelming scientific consensus about the climate emergency and the broad public support for urgent action, we have failed to take meaningful action.",32,,
227,0.97,1492.858,1499.598,In large part because the systemic power of the fossil fuel in her industry.,32,,
228,0.97,1499.598,1500.465,That is a fact.,32,,
229,0.97,1500.465,1504.803,You also said something I do not agree with.,32,,
230,0.97,1504.803,1515.881,You said Fortunately in Seattle we have found the keys to unlocking progress on climate by taking the economic fight head-on with the green new deal and flipping the trickle down narrative upside down.,32,,
231,0.97,1515.881,1521.286,Just explain where I'm coming from.,32,,
232,0.97,1521.286,1532.364,"When we are facing a global existential crisis I do not think it is good enough for the city to be may be better than some other cities and some Metrics which obviously is important, but it is simply not enough.",32,,
233,0.97,1532.364,1542.54,"I am sure scientifically speaking, you will have to agree that the measure of success in the case of climate change has to be far more sober and in line with the devastating statistics.",32,,
234,0.97,1542.54,1551.449,I am not sure I understand how you can say that Seattle has flipped the trickle down narrative upside down.,32,,
235,0.97,1551.449,1554.319,Seattle budgeted $6.5 billion out of a multibillion-dollar budget for the green new deal.,32,,
236,0.97,1554.319,1567.065,"We know from reports released by the office of Sustainability and environment itself that greenhouse gas emissions, especially if you look at building omissions in Seattle that they have continued to increase, not decrease.",32,,
237,0.97,1567.065,1577.776,If you could just Express some thoughts on what you need and what you think needs to happen to reverse that.,32,,
238,0.97,1577.776,1579.811,I think that you are absolutely right.,33,,
239,0.97,1579.811,1583.548,The depth and urgency of the crisis is deeply profound.,33,,
240,0.97,1583.548,1595.527,"What I would say is that part of that and part of what I hope is that we can take the things, this will go back to what I said earlier around scale.",33,,
241,0.97,1595.527,1597.562,It's not that we have solved the problem here.,33,,
242,0.97,1597.562,1599.03,We have a lot of work to do.,33,,
243,0.97,1599.03,1611.376,We are doing some experiments and we are doing projects that are showing the way . The challenge now here in the city is to scale them to the size of the problem.,33,,
244,0.97,1611.376,1616.348,"That is also to recognize, as you point out this is a global problem in a national problem.",33,,
245,0.97,1616.348,1622.654,And yet that does not mean that we do not act in the city and we don't act as an example in a laboratory.,33,,
246,0.97,1622.654,1632.197,One of the things we all know too well is that people can say we could not do something in the city because it's a national or global problem.,33,,
247,0.97,1632.197,1648.48,"Really, I think cities are laboratories and places where we get to test what works . We can lead by example and in the community of cities, Seattle has been a community of cities through programs like C 40 and others to push climate policy that way.",33,,
248,0.97,1648.48,1654.452,I really truly agree with you and the depth of the problem in the global nature of the problem.,33,,
249,0.97,1654.452,1665.663,"Yet, I think we need to continue to wrestle with it locally and do our own work to scale our answers.",33,,
250,0.97,1665.663,1666.297,Thank you.,34,,
251,0.97,1666.297,1675.206,Just one other thing which it would be great if you would Express some thoughts about this.,34,,
252,0.97,1675.206,1695.894,"You said in your responses to the question that as the director you will be committed to making the same case for transformation on climate investment in our city and region based on, this is a quote from your responses, based on the layers of the clean energy economy and using climate pollution and building healthy communities.",34,,
253,0.97,1695.894,1698.83,All of which I agree with.,34,,
254,0.97,1698.83,1727.826,"I think as we all know, those of us that have worked in politics no matter which positions you have taken, anybody has to honestly acknowledge that for anything like Transformational climate investments as you say and as I agree with, it cannot be done without coming into direct conflict . It is a systemic power of the fossil fuel industry.",34,,
255,0.97,1727.826,1743.575,"How it starts manifesting itself including in political entities is the main obstacle, not the knowledge of ordinary people understanding the need to urgently move away from fossil fuels, these are the values.",34,,
256,0.97,1743.575,1748.113,They are systemic and political.,34,,
257,0.97,1748.113,1769.267,"How do you see your role as the director when all of that is true because if you are to lead on any Transformational climate investment for the city, it will inevitably put you in conflict with major powers and the establishment and big business.",34,,
258,0.97,1769.267,1773.938,How will you deal with that?,34,,
259,0.97,1773.938,1800.165,"Just to give you a concrete example, other main obstacles for green new deal investments is public revenues . that is the primary and only obstacle is the absolute authorization of the business and wealthy entities.",34,,
260,0.97,1800.165,1806.237,Paying anything close to their fair share of taxes that the city or state level and also nationally we know this is true.,34,,
261,0.97,1806.237,1818.75,I will start by acknowledging that perspective ..,35,,
262,0.97,1820.785,1853.585,Part of the reason I think that the green new deal has the potential to be so powerful is that it centers a different economic story and gives us the opportunity it is about centering workers and undoing harms of the past five focusing on broad-based prosperity and partnerships with labor partners and community partners.,35,,
263,0.97,1853.585,1867.065,"Therefore, making investments that are about centering people and the things that we know create economic prosperity which is broad-based participation, people having well-paying jobs.",35,,
264,0.97,1867.065,1894.292,"Those are the things . It is easy to stop environmental regulations . We know that is not the case but we are bathed in a mythology where people hear that and they are like, my own economic well-being is so already difficult.",35,,
265,0.97,1894.292,1908.306,I will vote no on this carbon tax or to my legislator to vote no or not pay attention because you are too busy working to me the green new deal is really important.,35,,
266,0.97,1908.306,1932.797,It gives us an economic narrative . We have this opportunity to show a different way of doing things and centering the prosperity of regular people and as an environmental imperative.,35,,
267,0.97,1932.797,1933.431,Thank you.,36,,
268,0.97,1933.431,1941.806,I appreciate your responses and the discussion we were able to have and the responses you sent in writing.,36,,
269,0.97,1941.806,1946.344,Are there any other questions or comments from committee members?,36,,
270,0.97,1946.344,1970.068,"I don't see anything so I will not delay this further . If there are no further questions, I will move to approve Jessyn Farrell as the director of the office of Sustainability.",36,,
271,0.97,1970.068,1971.102,Can I have a second?,36,,
272,0.97,1971.102,1971.703,Second.,37,,

280,0.97,2011.776,2013.811,I'm delighted and looking forward to working with you.,41,,
281,0.97,2013.811,2015.68,Thank you.,42,,
282,0.97,2015.68,2023.287,Our final item for today is the reappointment of five green new deal oversight board members.,43,,

287,0.97,2071.436,2071.836,In my right?,43,,
288,0.97,2071.836,2072.87,That is correct.,44,,
289,0.97,2072.87,2073.571,These are all Reappointments.,44,,
290,0.97,2073.571,2079.911,They all participated in the green new deal oversight board over the past few months.,44,,
291,0.97,2079.911,2084.248,It was a short appointment because it was the first appointment.,44,,
292,0.97,2084.248,2091.422,The initial term has expired less than a year into their appointment.,44,,
293,0.97,2091.422,2092.723,Thank you for that information.,45,,
294,0.97,2092.723,2097.028,I will now move appointments.,45,,

308,0.97,2148.646,2148.88,Yes.,51,,
309,0.97,2148.88,2154.752,First of all I want to thank you for taking the time to propose the questions to Jessyn Farrell on the office of Sustainability.,52,,
310,0.97,2154.752,2164.028,Your work has been amazing with the green new deal and efforts to keep moving this forward.,52,,
311,0.97,2164.028,2174.372,"I really always learn something and appreciate something, particularly in the conversation that you had with Jessyn on the green new deal and there's always this argument that it is jobs versus the environment.",52,,
312,0.97,2174.372,2200.765,"And somebody can tackle it from an intellectual level and factual level, not just political slogans but actual dialogue about the threat that we have with climate change, I want to appreciate your intellect to moving this forward and not letting this go.",52,,
313,0.97,2200.765,2201.065,Thank you.,52,,
314,0.97,2201.065,2201.599,Thank you.,53,,
315,0.97,2201.599,2205.102,I really appreciate those words.,53,,
316,0.97,2205.102,2206.337,You are absolutely right.,53,,
317,0.97,2206.337,2209.04,It is always falsely presented as jobs versus planet.,53,,
318,0.97,2209.04,2213.544,We will have neither and what we need is both and that the only way it can work.,53,,
319,0.97,2213.544,2218.115,It is especially relevant to our indigenous communities.,53,,
320,0.97,2218.115,2227.391,This is most sharply and ruthless for the oppressed and Underrepresented communities.,53,,
321,0.97,2227.391,2233.564,I have learned a lot from you.,54,,
322,0.97,2233.564,2238.903,Because I am older than you I always Hearken back to a famous Supreme Court case which I cannot remember off the top of my head.,54,,
323,0.97,2238.903,2242.907,I think it was justice Douglas that said will he wait until we have the last salmon in the river?,54,,
324,0.97,2242.907,2243.808,That is from the 70s.,54,,
325,0.97,2243.808,2245.71,It's not new to me.,54,,
326,0.97,2245.71,2258.99,Tribes have been doing this so I am glad to see that we are having other Non-Colonial ways of thinking collectively about the environment.,54,,
327,0.97,2258.99,2259.29,Thank you.,54,,
328,0.97,2259.29,2269.8,That is a great metaphor.,55,,
