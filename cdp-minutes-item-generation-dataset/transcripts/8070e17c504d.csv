29,0.97,117.517,129.095,Item number one is to renew the agreement between the city of Seattle and the woodland park Swroovment the current agreement is active until February 2022.,16,,
30,0.97,129.095,158.525,"There year, both parties the woodland park zoo and the city have negotiated an agreement to update the policy related to the zoo policy and operations to the care of the zoo animals and setting up meetings between elected lawyers, city attorney's office above the city parks Department and woodland park zoo to establish priorities.",16,,
31,0.97,158.525,176.276,"May 2021, my office received a preliminary high-level meeting on the goals and the benefits and the draft term sheet by the woodland park zoo, and we have been sharing these with our colleagues and constituents.",16,,
32,0.97,176.276,182.482,We transmitted the agreed-upon proposal in the form of Council bill 120164 on August 3.,16,,
33,0.97,182.482,202.502,"As soon as it was transmitted, our office began reviewing the provisions as it's our responsibility to come through and understand the impact on the zoo animals, operation, what this zoo means to the constituents, to the Commitee and the neighborhood and all of our city partners.",16,,
34,0.97,202.502,206.506,The legislation was scheduled for a committee meeting on September 10.,16,,
35,0.97,206.506,215.281,We held a public hearing and briefing and heard concerns and support from the public during public comment and Presenters.,16,,
36,0.97,215.281,226.926,"It was clear after the September discussion that we needed more time to consider legal provisions, constituent concerns and potential amendment.",16,,
37,0.97,226.926,231.731,So we scheduled the committee vote after the fall budget process.,16,,
38,0.97,231.731,249.549,Since then we had three months or over 80 days to engage with central staff and Councilmembers including Councilmember Strauss representing zone six.,16,,
39,0.97,249.549,265.531,And I established a November 30th deadline for proposed amendments because I knew it would be complicated and under budget I knew that certain Councilmembers had to make time for constituents in the zoo and leadership.,16,,
40,0.97,265.531,267.166,So I appreciate everyone sticking to the schedule.,16,,
41,0.97,267.166,275.475,The city and the zoo had a chance to review and offer feedback on the amendments to the proposed contract.,16,,

46,0.97,328.895,342.375,"Following this, Briangoodnight will provide an over new, and if we are ready to vote, I will administer the process and do this each one by one in the order listed on the agenda.",16,,
47,0.97,342.375,345.578,The conflicting amendments will be considered together.,16,,
48,0.97,345.578,349.615,The last three--actually the last five are.,16,,
49,0.97,349.615,354.153,But we'll get to that in a moment.,16,,
50,0.97,354.153,359.358,We will have three amendments with revisions that we should hear today.,16,,
51,0.97,359.358,361.527,Brian should conclude those in his report.,16,,
52,0.97,361.527,386.452,"I have had an opportunity to review the 70-Page proposed contract, four exhibits and of the four exhibits, exhibit number three is the July 2021 Mlu and exhibit number four with two Appendices, a and B, one of them is key to the stepped-up sections even more, thank you woodland park zoo, and, of course, the insurance provision.",16,,
53,0.97,386.452,392.859,We will speak more to the substance of the legislation when we arrive at that agenda item following the amendment.,16,,
54,0.97,392.859,393.059,Okay.,16,,
55,0.97,393.059,397.63,So that's what we have for the zoo park.,16,,
56,0.97,397.63,408.474,"Agenda item two, the second item is a resolution regarding the creation and conservation grant application process for the parks Department.",16,,
57,0.97,408.474,411.411,We do this I think every year.,16,,
58,0.97,411.411,412.912,It's pretty straightforward.,16,,
59,0.97,412.912,434.4,"We'll have more discussion on that when we get to agenda item number two, and Lastly which I am happy to tell you about is a bill that would create the indigenous advisory Council or I AC.",16,,
60,0.97,434.4,464.797,"We looked at the Federal model, the state model, and a few cities, and I am happy to say this will be the first time in the city's history in the legislative Department we will have an actual indigenous advisory committee to advise the legislative branch and I am very happy to see this evolve the way it has with community support and tribal support and support from the urban indigenous organizations.",16,,
61,0.97,464.797,471.337,I am hoping it gets passed today and we get the members seated to start the work W.,16,,
62,0.97,471.337,480.58,"That, we will move to public comment and open the remote public comment period.",16,,
63,0.97,480.58,500.666,And we have the public comment regularly included on the meeting agenda but we reserve the right to end or eliminate the public comment period at any point it's unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner to conduct business.,16,,
64,0.97,500.666,505.304,I will moderate the period in the following matter.,16,,
65,0.97,505.304,509.208,The public comment period is up to 20 minutes.,16,,
66,0.97,509.208,513.579,How many speakers do we have signed up?,16,,

131,0.97,869.435,874.24,My name is mark Jordan speaking in support of the woodland park zoo.,31,,
132,0.97,874.24,880.946,I am an associate professor of biology at Seattle University and a resident of beacon hill in Seattle.,31,,
133,0.97,880.946,902.601,Seattle University and the zoo collaborate on the Seattle urban Carnivore project that involves wildlife cameras throughout the Seattle Metro area and we have Co-Developed the Carnivore Spotter Website which allows any community members to support a Carnivore they see in their yard or walking their dog.,31,,
134,0.97,902.601,920.619,And this is a benefit to a variety of audiences but my students can build vital research skills and any community member can share their wildlife Spottings on Carnivore Spotter.,31,,
135,0.97,920.619,930.496,"Our research has had research papers on urbanization, and we have a lot of information that we share with various audiences about Coexisting with Carnivores.",31,,
136,0.97,930.496,933.632,I want to emphasize while the zoo --,31,,
137,0.97,933.632,934.5,Thank you for speaking.,32,,

144,0.97,964.663,966.498,I'm here.,33,,

146,0.97,973.005,983.682,I and thousands of others have lived the experience why 12.3 needs to be amended so there is no question of the legality.,33,,
147,0.97,983.682,989.788,This is not intended to interfere with the routine operation of the video.,33,,
148,0.97,989.788,998.63,Councilmembers had favored Sanctuaries and then voted no to move the ordinance that would have directed the zoo to send the elephants to the Sanctuaries.,33,,
149,0.97,998.63,1004.97,They told me the reason for their no vote is the city doesn't have the authority to pass the ordinance.,33,,
150,0.97,1004.97,1014.513,It needs to be well defined that the city has the authority to intervene on behalf of an animal's welfare.,33,,
151,0.97,1014.513,1025.724,Woodland woodland park zoo should not have a problem because they put the animals first.,33,,
152,0.97,1025.724,1029.728,You have the I Refutable decision to make policy.,33,,
153,0.97,1029.728,1033.599,Thank you.,33,,

162,0.97,1052.951,1057.389,The council must have the ability to set policy for the animals on the zoo.,37,,
163,0.97,1057.389,1062.661,12.3 removes the right from the city council.,37,,
164,0.97,1062.661,1069.067,It should be rerouted to allow the city Council to intervene on behalf of any animals in the video.,37,,
165,0.97,1069.067,1071.203,Funding should be lowered.,37,,
166,0.97,1071.203,1077.443,Why fund frivolous item when is people are literally dying on the sidewalks?,37,,
167,0.97,1077.443,1086.819,Animals can be put on display doing nothing to diversify the Gene pool for the animals in their native countries.,37,,
168,0.97,1086.819,1093.192,The main things zoo teach is it's okay for humans to dominant animals as we see fight.,37,,
169,0.97,1093.192,1106.805,The Council should be working to abolish the zoo and repatriate animals to Sanctuaries in their native countries.,37,,
170,0.97,1106.805,1110.008,Please reduce new funding.,37,,
171,0.97,1110.008,1112.544,Thank you.,37,,

346,0.97,2286.484,2309.607,"During our individual meetings with Councilmembers we heard concerns of oversight and long range pricing and Councilmembers about the thoughts of the duration of the agreement, and we spent many hours with the District six Councilmember Strauss discussing public benefits and meeting with neighbors.",77,,
347,0.97,2309.607,2318.683,We want to thank all of you for improving and refining this that we have brought here.,77,,
348,0.97,2318.683,2342.306,I credit woodland park zoo for being instrumental in the education of endangered species and educate adults and children who love animal and inspire people to take action and save nature.,77,,
349,0.97,2342.306,2351.182,"In 2021, even in the middle of a pandemic, we are breaking records with over 38,000 household memberships.",77,,
350,0.97,2351.182,2358.723,This the the largest membership of any organization in the Pacific Northwest.,77,,
351,0.97,2358.723,2365.062,The zoo is the most visited Non- profit in the region at 1.2 million visits a year.,77,,
352,0.97,2365.062,2385.449,"In 2019, which was our last year of full operations before the pandemic, we welcomed over 71000 visits by student and teachers, over 700,000 guests attend public education programs, and 2500 participants enrolled in education classes.",77,,
353,0.97,2385.449,2391.622,"In addition to our education reach to the community, the zoo is a significant economic engine for the city.",77,,
354,0.97,2391.622,2406.67,During the last decade from 2009 to 2018 the revenue impact of zoo visitors was close to $1 billion.,77,,
355,0.97,2406.67,2413.577,We employ nearly 400 full-time employees represented by nine labor unions.,77,,
356,0.97,2413.577,2427.091,Most importantly we care for over 1200 animals that receive the best dedicated care and most specialized diet and consideration that every species needs.,77,,
357,0.97,2427.091,2433.431,"We are rooted in science, and we make Data-Driven decisions every day.",77,,
358,0.97,2433.431,2439.737,But the result is that our true organizational effort is our compassion.,77,,
359,0.97,2439.737,2450.514,All Councilmembers are welcome to meet me at the zoo and I extend an invitation to show you how we are passionate about animal care every day of the year.,77,,
360,0.97,2450.514,2462.193,"At the core of the conversations with many of you, the Councilmembers of the committee is to ensure that the people of Seattle receive the public benefits that are derived from the support to the zoo.",77,,
361,0.97,2462.193,2474.338,"We, too, want to make sure that the zoo reaches all the the people in Seattle, and we're very proud of the public benefits attached to this agreement.",77,,
362,0.97,2474.338,2483.347,"This is a significant increase in public benefits from our past agreement, and we're very proud of these benefits and we are proud of the accountability this entails.",77,,
363,0.97,2483.347,2488.018,We hope to be able to review the benefits with all of you later in this meeting.,77,,
364,0.97,2488.018,2498.696,You will see that many of the amendments put forth by Councilmembers hold us accountable to fulfill this commitment.,77,,
365,0.97,2498.696,2508.672,In some cases we are not able to support the amendment because we think it would harm the zoo or operations.,77,,
366,0.97,2508.672,2513.377,We feel we must stay affordable to our community.,77,,
367,0.97,2513.377,2523.42,"Let me remind you that 40% of the visitors are middle income households, and the vast majority of our guests are local and regional residents.",77,,
368,0.97,2523.42,2525.523,They are our neighbors.,77,,
369,0.97,2525.523,2526.757,"They are our friends, and our community.",77,,
370,0.97,2526.757,2534.331,It is in to the in our business interest to price the zoo out of the reach of Seattle families.,77,,
371,0.97,2534.331,2541.438,It will harm the business revenue that we need to earn in support to our commitment to the city.,77,,
372,0.97,2541.438,2546.977,One final word about how the Acredited Zoos are managed.,77,,
373,0.97,2546.977,2551.448,All Acredited Zoos in the U.S.,77,,
374,0.97,2551.448,2556.72,Are managed by professional leadership even those run by non-profit entities like the woodland park zoo.,77,,
375,0.97,2556.72,2559.59,The reason is very simple.,77,,
376,0.97,2559.59,2572.369,Managing a modern Acredited zoo to global standards is a complex operation with multiple critical decision points and requires professional Spreadsheets.,77,,
377,0.97,2572.369,2585.482,To remain Acredited and accountable the woodland park zoo is managed by a team of the best professionals in the world and continues to be a global leader in innovation and animal care and conservation.,77,,
378,0.97,2585.482,2595.859,We have worked hard with each one of you with the parks Department to continue the extremely successful relationship which is presented here in the new operations and management agreement.,77,,
379,0.97,2595.859,2613.41,We're truly looking forward to work another 20 years of success in providing the people of Seattle with the most compassion at and delightful zoo in the world for the benefit of everyone in Seattle.,77,,
380,0.97,2613.41,2613.711,Thank you.,77,,
381,0.97,2613.711,2617.915,"Thank you, doctor.",78,,
382,0.97,2617.915,2618.282,Superintendent?,78,,
383,0.97,2618.415,2630.494,"Thank you, chair Juarez and Councilmembers and thank you for the chance to speak on the agreement.",79,,
384,0.97,2630.494,2646.21,"I, too, want to express appreciation to the staff of the zoo and parks and recreation staff and Brian goodnight and the Council staff and all the Councilmembers who expressed interest in the agreement.",79,,
385,0.97,2646.21,2654.918,I also want to make sure that we highlight the support from the city attorney's office in working through some pretty complicated process and amendments as we have gone through this.,79,,
386,0.97,2654.918,2670.467,But I want to begin with Reemphasizing something that the doctor stated a couple of times which is really this is truly an incredibly beneficial relationship that has been in place for over 20 years.,79,,
387,0.97,2670.467,2685.482,"The city has a Long-Standing relationship with the zoo and really benefited in their expertise and ability to operate for the benefit of the zoo and, of course, the benefit of the public.",79,,
388,0.97,2685.482,2694.491,Our intent here is to renew this and continue their success and work closely with them to ensure that this will continue in operations.,79,,
389,0.97,2694.491,2724.088,"I think that as we--as the doctor stated we started this conversation many years ago but it was Pre-Pandemic and everything was put on hold but as we Re-Engage from the Department's perspective we were looking to create an agreement to be successful and provide the basic and additional benefits to the city, and I'm happy to report that from our perspective, this is a better and more favorable agreement for the city.",79,,
390,0.97,2724.088,2750.614,"It's been noted a couple of times about the public benefit component of this, and I want to certainly express my appreciation, chair Juarez, and we really believe this is a strong portfolio that will be provided as part of this.",79,,
391,0.97,2750.614,2766.73,"This agreement as you know includes a long range plan that the zoo will work through, and as long as we are in the plan process, the zoo will--including support from the Department--will develop and provide for us a plan.",79,,
392,0.97,2766.73,2770.868,"Then we will review it, and then approve it or not.",79,,
393,0.97,2770.868,2786.984,It has various processes that we will negotiate if there are differences in opinion here and one key difference is it allows the zoo or the city to terminate the agreement if we are not able to come to terms on a long-range plan.,79,,
394,0.97,2786.984,2801.398,"The current agreement doesn't allow the city to terminate the plan if it's not to our--or if it was not acceptable, and other things put in place, the annual reporting requirements.",79,,
395,0.97,2801.398,2815.045,"The other piece I wanted to say is with this new agreement we worked really hard to make sure that we withheld the authority that the city had in the ownership and, of course, managing this zoo.",79,,
396,0.97,2815.045,2818.415,The zoo society is managing on behalf.,79,,
397,0.97,2818.415,2818.615,City.,79,,
398,0.97,2818.615,2828.025,"We, as a Department, will be administering this agreement and the Deliverables including the public benefits and the long range plan.",79,,
399,0.97,2828.025,2853.75,"And, of course, as is true of everything else that we do, the--the superintendent, the Department will bring annually and as part of the regular budget cycle to the council as dictated through the agreement so ultimately the Council has final approval.",79,,
400,0.97,2853.75,2856.453,And I want to talk about the long-range plan.,79,,
401,0.97,2856.453,2877.04,"There was concern about the superintendent with the city, and I think it's important and as the doctor mentioned, the Zoos are complex, complicated scientific institutions that if every instance I am aware of, Acredited and managed by partner organizations, and that's the case here.",79,,
402,0.97,2877.04,2891.788,There aren't any that I'm aware of where the city couple does any management or overview or approval plans of the zoo including in Tacoma and others.,79,,
403,0.97,2891.788,2894.291,We're confident that the current agree.,79,,
404,0.97,2894.291,2938.035,"S between the city through the Department of parks and recreation and the zoo will achieve everything that we like, and just to wrap up, we, too, have been working closely since the September 10 hearing, and we have addressed the community members working closely with the zoo and our staff to look at the topics that were brought up and continue to focus on the creative agreement that, again, will be best for the city and allow the zoo to continue to be successful and thrive and allow us as a Department to be held accountable.",79,,
405,0.97,2938.035,2946.81,"So I--I will stop there and share that I look forward to the process today and again, I want to thank the team.",79,,
406,0.97,2946.81,2958.956,I do want to highlight that my team are here to help answer questions later if needed but they are really doing an incredible job Interfacing with the zoo and the Council.,79,,
407,0.97,2958.956,2959.823,Thank you.,79,,
408,0.97,2959.823,2966.463,"Thank you, superintendent.",80,,
409,0.97,2966.463,2982.713,"I apologize I was Remiss in not introducing Larry Phillips who sits on the board and was a phenomenal mentor to me with the zoo and the district, and is there anything that you want to share before we launch into this?",80,,
410,0.97,2982.846,2984.114,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez.",81,,
411,0.97,2984.114,2986.783,I appreciate the chance to be here with you today.,81,,
412,0.97,2986.783,3000.197,"I think that the doctor did a wonderful job as far as introducing the aspects of the agreement and the support for it, and the public testimony in support of the agreement was quite remarkable.",81,,
413,0.97,3000.197,3002.499,I am happy to be available for questions.,81,,
414,0.97,3002.499,3009.773,But I think their comments were a great introduction for today's proceeding.,81,,
415,0.97,3009.773,3010.073,Thank you.,81,,
416,0.97,3010.073,3025.589,"I want to thank you because you Ray are retired, and you took the time to walk through this with me, and I thank you for that, sir.",82,,
417,0.97,3025.589,3028.825,"So with that, I thank everybody.",82,,
418,0.97,3028.825,3035.098,"And Brian, you want to talk us to where we want to go with the Resentation and then we will go to the amendment?",82,,
419,0.97,3035.098,3036.4,Thank you.,83,,
420,0.97,3036.4,3042.506,Let me go up and pull up the presentation and make sure you all can see that before I continue.,83,,
421,0.97,3042.506,3047.411,"Chair Juarez, are you able to see that presentation?",83,,
422,0.97,3047.411,3047.611,Okay.,83,,
423,0.97,3047.611,3048.245,Sorry.,84,,
424,0.97,3048.245,3049.312,Yes.,84,,
425,0.97,3049.312,3050.414,"I can see it, thank you.",84,,
426,0.97,3050.414,3051.448,Thank you very much.,85,,
427,0.97,3051.448,3062.025,So as you all know and has been said things are moving quite quickly in regards to the amendment or with this agreement and possible amendment.,85,,
428,0.97,3062.025,3066.43,I will do my best to summarize it and walk through.,85,,
429,0.97,3066.43,3073.47,So there are 15 proposed amendments that the Councilmembers have chosen to move forward to today's meeting.,85,,
430,0.97,3073.47,3081.478,"10 of those amendments do not conflict with the other, and they can choose all, none, or any combination of the amendments.",85,,
431,0.97,3081.478,3084.147,These amendments will be walked through one by one.,85,,
432,0.97,3084.147,3087.017,Five do conflict with at least one other amendment.,85,,
433,0.97,3087.017,3093.857,After going through the Non- conflicting amendments we will get to the ones that have conflict.,85,,
434,0.97,3093.857,3104.901,We have shown that the conflicting are shown on one slide and the committee can choose prove just one of the amendments.,85,,
435,0.97,3104.901,3119.783,"Yesterday I sent out a memo posted to the agenda that summarizes the proposed amendments and has a few tables you may find helpful, and contains the actual amendment as an attachment.",85,,
436,0.97,3119.783,3134.598,The zoo and parks amendment has been in contact since the draft amendment and as a product of that work and coordination three of the amendments have changed.,85,,
437,0.97,3134.598,3146.51,So these revised versions were distributed O committee members yesterday and this morning and my understanding is they will be posted to the agenda following the meeting for reference purposes.,85,,
438,0.97,3146.51,3159.456,"So in the slide presentation, the slides will indicate the three items that have revised versions with a red version number so that will indicate that the amendments have changed and the new version is the likely one to be moved for consideration.",85,,
439,0.97,3159.456,3168.832,"And chair war--Juarez, that's all I have for the overview and I can continue to amendment number one.",85,,
440,0.97,3168.832,3170.267,"Yes, let's do it.",86,,
441,0.97,3170.267,3190.053,"Great, thank you, and amendment number one is sponsored by chair Juarez and has a new version since yesterday and I I will show version 2 and it will insert section 31.9 in the agreement.",87,,
442,0.97,3190.053,3206.703,"The current agreement with the society contains a similar provision, and the amendment would Correctar error in the Council bill with a reference to attachment a where it should be in reference to attachment one.",87,,
443,0.97,3206.703,3208.204,It's a Typo that was corrected.,87,,
444,0.97,3208.204,3209.973,Thank you.,88,,
445,0.97,3209.973,3215.145,Not a lot there.,88,,
446,0.97,3215.145,3217.981,This is basically technical and not much more to add.,88,,
447,0.97,3217.981,3235.031,"This is my amendment, and I move to amendment Council bill 120164 by substituting amendment 1, version 2 for version 1. great.",88,,

462,0.97,3282.445,3282.646,Yes.,101,,
463,0.97,3282.646,3282.912,Okay.,102,,

465,0.97,3286.583,3288.485,"Amendment 1, version 2 has been adopted.",103,,
466,0.97,3288.485,3289.686,Great.,104,,
467,0.97,3289.686,3292.389,And I think--I think that's it.,104,,
468,0.97,3292.389,3292.656,Correct?,104,,
469,0.97,3292.789,3294.19,Yes.,105,,
470,0.97,3294.19,3295.358,We can move on to the next amendment.,105,,
471,0.97,3295.358,3297.36,All right.,106,,
472,0.97,3297.36,3297.894,And that motion carries.,106,,
473,0.97,3297.894,3322.452,"It's moved on, and we'll go on to amendment number two, and I have some comments before we start two because, Councilmember Strauss, who I invited to the committee who is not a member but can join has amendment number two to five and I believe he will have amendment 13.",106,,
474,0.97,3322.752,3340.67,"Yes, I would move them each individually and vote on them individually, rather than All- In-One group.",107,,
475,0.97,3340.67,3346.042,"Okay, with that, do you want to go ahead and present?",108,,
476,0.97,3346.042,3351.014,Thank you very much.,109,,
477,0.97,3351.014,3355.485,"Amendment 2, as you mentioned is authored by Councilmember Strauss and relates to the composition of the society board of directors.",109,,
478,0.97,3355.485,3364.16,It would require recruitment of neighbors from two of the following neighborhoods.,109,,
479,0.97,3364.16,3374.771,The board would also be required to recruit two members are members of historically Underserved communities or that reside in neighborhoods with a high percentage of residents living below the poverty line.,109,,
480,0.97,3374.771,3375.472,Those are my remarks.,109,,
481,0.97,3375.472,3385.548,"All right, so with that, do I allow --",110,,
482,0.97,3385.548,3398.294,"Chair Juarez, yes, I would ask that you move that amendment, get a second, and then Councilmember Strauss could speak to it.",111,,
483,0.97,3398.294,3401.564,So I will move it.,112,,
484,0.97,3401.564,3401.898,Seconded.,113,,
485,0.97,3401.898,3408.505,It is moved and Seconded.,114,,
486,0.97,3408.505,3409.572,"Councilmember Strauss, this is your amendment.",114,,
487,0.97,3409.572,3410.707,Can you speak to it today?,114,,
488,0.97,3410.707,3417.013,"S, thank you chair and everyone I worked with.",115,,
489,0.97,3417.013,3423.219,I heard in public comment today that my amendment misses the mark in the eyes of some in the community.,115,,
490,0.97,3423.219,3435.899,I will say that the difference is whether the community is choosing board members where the zoo is choosing these members.,115,,
491,0.97,3435.899,3439.335,My apologies to the community members who don't feel that I met the spirit of the request.,115,,
492,0.97,3439.335,3455.418,"We did work with the zoo and others throughout the city to bring this amendment forward so that there is a minimum, not a ceiling, a minimum of board members recruited from the neighborhood and those neighborhoods are called out by name.",115,,
493,0.97,3455.418,3459.622,"And the importance of balancing that with a minimum, again, a floor, not a ceiling.",115,,
494,0.97,3459.622,3474.304,"This is a regional destination and we need to make sure that we are keeping in mind the needs of people from throughout King County, throughout the region, who also visit this zoo.",115,,
495,0.97,3474.304,3483.446,Which is why we want to have board members from parts of our community that are residing below the poverty line.,115,,
496,0.97,3483.446,3486.282,"So this is a good amendment, in my opinion.",115,,
497,0.97,3486.282,3500.697,It is a good compromise between all parties and requires the zoo board to recruit two members from the neighborhood.,115,,
498,0.97,3500.697,3506.402,And to members from historically Underserved communities throughout the region.,115,,
499,0.97,3506.402,3506.836,"Thank you, chair.",115,,
500,0.97,3506.836,3511.074,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",116,,
501,0.97,3511.074,3516.112,Are there additional comments on amendment number two dig?,116,,
502,0.97,3516.112,3517.313,Councilmember Herbold?,116,,
503,0.97,3517.313,3522.018,"Thanks, just a question.",117,,
504,0.97,3522.018,3526.556,"I should know the answer to this, but I will show my lack of knowledge in asking the question.",117,,
505,0.97,3526.556,3529.692,Do board appointments come to the Council for confirmation?,117,,
506,0.97,3529.692,3532.795,Yes.,118,,
507,0.97,3532.795,3533.396,They do?,119,,
508,0.97,3533.396,3537.5,That was my understanding.,120,,
509,0.97,3537.5,3538.902,No?,120,,
510,0.97,3538.902,3539.702,"I am sorry, I misspoke.",120,,
511,0.97,3539.702,3544.807,I should let Councilmember Strauss speak to that.,120,,
512,0.97,3544.807,3550.246,I thought you were talking about the park board.,120,,
513,0.97,3550.246,3551.481,You are talking about the community board.,120,,
514,0.97,3551.481,3555.351,"Okay, I am talking about the zoo board.",121,,
515,0.97,3555.351,3555.919,Councilmember Strauss.,122,,
516,0.97,3555.919,3559.822,I would have to refer to the zoo.,123,,
517,0.97,3559.822,3564.661,I do not believe that the board members come to the city council for approval.,123,,
518,0.97,3564.661,3582.579,"The zoo board is a Non-For profit board and as such is selected by a vote on the board and there are board members that are designated to the Mayor's office, parks Department, to the Council, and King County.",124,,
519,0.97,3582.579,3591.287,"Those members are selected and named by themselves, so in the future, these community members of the board will be designated for the neighborhoods where they belong to.",124,,
520,0.97,3591.287,3598.761,So these would be permanent positions on the board that are assigned to those neighborhoods.,124,,
521,0.97,3598.761,3610.206,"But to answer your question, Councilmember Herbold, knows the board members are not voted on by the city council.",124,,
522,0.97,3610.206,3612.542,"Thank you so much, I appreciate having that information.",125,,
523,0.97,3612.542,3614.21,Think you for clearing that up.,126,,
524,0.97,3614.21,3616.879,I apologize for speaking too soon.,126,,
525,0.97,3616.879,3617.513,I Misheard your question.,126,,
526,0.97,3617.513,3622.385,Are there any additional comments?,126,,
527,0.97,3622.385,3625.421,"Seeing none, will the clerk please call the role for adoption of amendment number 2.",126,,
528,0.97,3625.421,3630.493,Herbold.,127,,

536,0.97,3645.675,3649.812,The motion carries and the amendment is adopted.,134,,
537,0.97,3649.812,3651.214,"Let's go to amendment number three, Brian.",134,,
538,0.97,3651.214,3671.934,"This amendment would modify section 16.1 of the proposed agreement to require additional information to be provided in the annual report, such as the society's efforts to conserve species and natural Habitats, climate change, and public engagement and conservation actions.",135,,
539,0.97,3671.934,3686.716,The amendment would also modify the Appendix of the proposed agreement to add a section related to conservation and committing the society to using not less than 3% of gross revenue annually for projects related to species and habitat conservation.,135,,
540,0.97,3686.716,3695.124,Lastly it would address the city's commitment to investing in utility analysis infrastructure and other systems necessary to achieve goals.,135,,
541,0.97,3695.124,3695.725,That concludes my summary.,135,,
542,0.97,3695.725,3696.292,Thank you.,136,,
543,0.97,3696.292,3708.404,"With that again, I moved to amend Council bill 120146 as presented on amendment number three on the agenda.",136,,
544,0.97,3708.404,3708.671,Second?,136,,
545,0.97,3708.671,3713.176,Second.,137,,
546,0.97,3713.176,3713.609,Great.,138,,
547,0.97,3713.609,3718.414,It has been moved and Seconded.,138,,
548,0.97,3718.414,3720.083,"Councilmember Strauss, can you speak to your amendment?",138,,
549,0.97,3720.083,3723.92,Thank you.,139,,
550,0.97,3723.92,3736.532,"Confirming, Brian, when you said utility usage improvement, that is talking about the conservation of electricity, water, and using organic materials on the grounds maintenance, is that correct?",139,,
551,0.97,3736.532,3741.337,Correct and it is also providing infrastructure so the zoo can measure their conservation activities.,140,,
552,0.97,3741.337,3747.11,So it is infrastructure they would need to see their progress over time.,140,,
553,0.97,3747.11,3751.347,"Great, thank you.",141,,
554,0.97,3751.347,3757.453,This amendment came to me from a resident I met with during office hours and thank you to the zoo for your work on this.,141,,
555,0.97,3757.453,3761.924,This is a Two-Pronged amendment.,141,,
556,0.97,3761.924,3767.263,One is conservation external to the land that the zoo sits on in the second Prong is internal conservation to how the zoo operates.,141,,
557,0.97,3767.263,3773.736,"So, externally and if you want to speak to this.",141,,
558,0.97,3773.736,3778.574,He does amazing work for conservation throughout the world.,141,,
559,0.97,3778.574,3789.285,How can the zoo provide a public benefit not only during the climate crisis and species extension throughout the world as something we should be doing.,141,,
560,0.97,3789.285,3805.601,"The second is reducing the amount of water and electricity consumed, ensuring that it is done so in a way that is keeping with native species and organic materials.",141,,
561,0.97,3805.601,3811.307,So we are trying to bring this toward being a public benefit.,141,,
562,0.97,3811.307,3813.476,I am not sure this is a clear public benefit.,141,,
563,0.97,3813.476,3826.522,"Nonetheless, it is important that there is a metric, a feature in this agreement that ensures conservation externally and internally as well.",141,,
564,0.97,3826.522,3831.794,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",142,,
565,0.97,3831.794,3836.232,Is there anything you would like to add?,142,,
566,0.97,3836.232,3837.9,If not that is fine as well.,142,,
567,0.97,3837.9,3839.635,I don't need to provide anything.,143,,
568,0.97,3839.635,3845.007,Thank you.,143,,
569,0.97,3845.007,3846.008,Any other discussion?,144,,

581,0.97,3875.071,3887.049,Is it possible for me to address this amendment before it is brought forward to us?,155,,
582,0.97,3887.049,3888.484,Or does it need to be moved?,155,,
583,0.97,3888.484,3893.956,"I have to move it, you can't do it.",156,,
584,0.97,3893.956,3899.862,"I don't know, I will defer to the clerk, but we are on amendment number for now.",156,,
585,0.97,3899.862,3901.063,Can you pull that up?,156,,
586,0.97,3901.063,3902.498,We should have amendment 4 on the screen.,156,,
587,0.97,3902.498,3913.943,"If Councilmember Strauss would like to address it before you move it, that is fine, we just need to remember to go back and move it if it is indeed coming forward.",157,,
588,0.97,3913.943,3918.314,"Okay, go ahead Councilmember Strauss and then remind me to say something.",158,,
589,0.97,3918.314,3918.914,I will try.,159,,
590,0.97,3918.914,3920.016,"Okay, go ahead.",160,,
591,0.97,3920.016,3924.82,This amendment number four does not reflect what I originally put forward.,161,,
592,0.97,3924.82,3931.927,I think my original amendment is to refer to the original agreement.,161,,
593,0.97,3931.927,3936.632,"Councilmember Strauss, that is what this does.",162,,
594,0.97,3936.632,3938.801,Would you like me to provide my summary?,162,,
595,0.97,3938.801,3939.835,"Okay, thanks.",162,,
596,0.97,3939.835,3944.14,"This amendment, amendment 4, relates to naming rights.",162,,
597,0.97,3944.14,3954.25,The current agreement the city has requires any name changes of the facility to go through the parks board of commissioners and also the city council for approval.,162,,
598,0.97,3954.25,3973.969,"The proposed agreement requires just written approval of the superintendent, so this amendment would revert back to the language of the current agreement and would require formal action by what is now the board of parks and recreation commissioners and approval by the city council as well, for proposed name changes.",162,,
599,0.97,3973.969,3974.57,Thank you.,163,,
600,0.97,3974.57,3978.708,My confusion is require city Council and parks board approval.,163,,
601,0.97,3978.708,3983.479,"Thank you, that is just my shorthand in the title of this one.",164,,
602,0.97,3983.479,3986.182,I apologize.,164,,
603,0.97,3986.182,3990.486,"When I brought this amendment forward, there were a lot of conversations we were having.",165,,
604,0.97,3990.486,4003.466,"This was also brought forward by the community and the parks Department has been doing a fair amount of education with me, explaining the current process for Renaming or naming a parks facility.",165,,
605,0.97,4003.466,4022.485,"I have come to the understanding, it took some work, but I have come to this understanding that the current policy process for naming or Renaming a parks facility is more robust than what is contained within the original agreement.",165,,
606,0.97,4022.485,4034.73,Requiring both the city Council and the parks board to approve of the name change is more cumbersome and creates less good outcomes.,165,,
607,0.97,4034.73,4040.336,The reason I say this is we had the experience with electric bikes on the trail.,165,,
608,0.97,4040.336,4053.149,"This was a five year plus endeavor to allow electric bikes on the trail, because again, it required both city Council and parks board approval.",165,,
609,0.97,4053.149,4096.892,"At this point, chair Juarez, I would say on this record, I would not put this amendment forward, because I do believe that the parks policy of having city Council, somebody from city Council, having somebody from the community, to sit on the Proactive, name changing committee to then come to the superintendent's desk is not only going to create more robust outcomes, it provides the oversight that we need and frankly, you and I both know that if you are having trouble with the parks Department, the best thing to do is to call and have a conversation.",165,,
610,0.97,4096.892,4102.164,So I would kindly request that this amendment be removed.,165,,
611,0.97,4102.164,4107.203,"Okay, I actually agree.",166,,
612,0.97,4107.203,4115.978,"Because we have combined and we now have the board of parks and we did pass your amendment for more neighborhood involvement in some of the other changes, I do agree with you, Councilmember Strauss.",166,,
613,0.97,4115.978,4120.616,"Madam clerk, how do we do this?",166,,
614,0.97,4120.616,4125.121,We will just move on to the next amendment.,167,,
615,0.97,4125.121,4125.721,"Okay, great.",168,,
616,0.97,4125.721,4129.391,"So, 4 is gone.",168,,
617,0.97,4129.391,4139.201,"Let's move on to amendment 5, which is also yours, Councilmember Strauss.",168,,
618,0.97,4139.201,4140.336,I have an active district.,169,,
619,0.97,4140.336,4143.506,I will move it and then let you speak to it.,170,,
620,0.97,4143.506,4151.714,I moved to amend Council bill 120164 as presented by amendment five on the agenda.,170,,
621,0.97,4151.714,4152.548,Is there a second?,170,,
622,0.97,4152.548,4152.948,Second.,171,,
623,0.97,4152.948,4157.62,Thank you.,172,,
624,0.97,4157.62,4158.621,It has been moved and Seconded.,172,,
625,0.97,4158.621,4163.192,"Councilmember Strauss, do you want to speak to your amendment?",172,,
626,0.97,4163.192,4163.926,Thank you.,173,,
627,0.97,4163.926,4170.166,Thank you for letting me speak so much on a committee I am not a member of.,173,,
628,0.97,4170.166,4179.108,This is also a district six request that came to me in office hours and it is requiring the committee participation in the plan process.,173,,
629,0.97,4179.108,4195.991,"This is a Proactive way that both the community and staff or Council can engage in the long- range planning, rather than simply having it come to the city council for a vote.",173,,
630,0.97,4195.991,4206.969,"By having an advanced, Proactive ability to engage in the long-range plan, I believe we will create Longer-Lasting and more robust outcomes than just asking for our stamp at the end of the day.",173,,
631,0.97,4206.969,4208.203,"Councilmember Strauss, are you finished?",174,,
632,0.97,4208.203,4212.007,I kind of jumped the gun.,174,,
633,0.97,4212.007,4214.91,I will give you another chance to wrap up.,174,,
634,0.97,4214.91,4221.817,"I needed to have Brian walk us through amendment number 5, so I apologize.",174,,
635,0.97,4221.817,4230.125,"You want to explain to us and the viewing public, this amendment and what it does?",174,,
636,0.97,4230.125,4231.126,"Sure, thank you.",175,,
637,0.97,4231.126,4238.667,"The amendment would modify exhibit 4 and that is the one that lays out guiding principles for the development of the new, long-range plan.",175,,
638,0.97,4238.667,4242.238,To require the Developent of a community participation plan.,175,,
639,0.97,4242.238,4253.248,"Then as Councilmember Strauss was saying, it would allow the chair to identify staff and residents to participate in that community participation plan process.",175,,
640,0.97,4253.248,4253.916,Thank you.,176,,
641,0.97,4253.916,4256.952,I apologize for that.,176,,
642,0.97,4256.952,4265.661,Is there anyone else wants to comment or ask questions regarding amendment 5 and the community Particiption plan?,176,,
643,0.97,4265.661,4272.835,One clarifying question and then I will have said everything I need to say about this amendment.,177,,
644,0.97,4272.835,4281.877,"Can you confirm that this amendment also describes, by name, the neighborhoods in which community members would be selected?",177,,
645,0.97,4281.877,4286.148,"Green Lake, Longford and Fremont, is that correct?",177,,
646,0.97,4286.148,4297.159,"Correct, as you mentioned it is specifically drawn from staff and residents of the four neighborhoods adjacent to the zoo and names the neighborhoods you mentioned.",178,,
647,0.97,4297.159,4305.301,So it provides a process for neighborhood interaction in a Proactive manner including the long-range plan.,179,,
648,0.97,4305.301,4305.701,Thank you.,179,,
649,0.97,4305.701,4307.069,Those are my comments.,179,,
650,0.97,4307.069,4307.503,Great.,180,,
651,0.97,4307.503,4315.21,Specifically the community participation accessibility and empowerment.,180,,
652,0.97,4315.21,4327.723,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, for highlighting Fremont, green Lake, to be involved in the process set out by the community participation plan.",180,,
653,0.97,4327.723,4329.625,"With that, are there any questions?",180,,
654,0.97,4329.625,4336.332,"All right, seeing none, will the clerk please call the role?",180,,

668,0.97,4377.84,4381.777,The amendment would modify the agreement to provide the Council with approval authority over the long-range plan.,191,,
669,0.97,4381.777,4391.186,It would have the society submit the plan to the superintendent for approval in whole or in part.,191,,
670,0.97,4391.186,4398.894,"The superintendent would transmit the approved portions of the plan to Council for approval, rejection, or approval in part.",191,,
671,0.97,4398.894,4411.907,"In essence the amendment would allow the superintendent or Council to disapprove of the plan, parts of the plan or the whole thing, but it would require both the superintendent and the Council to approve of the plan.",191,,
672,0.97,4411.907,4413.175,The amendment does to other things.,191,,
673,0.97,4413.175,4432.327,"It modify section 9.3 of the agreement to specify the superintendent may only approve capital improvements that do not appear in the long-range plan if they are common repairs necessary for the operation of the zoo, but do not rise to the level of a project that should be included in the long-range plan.",191,,
674,0.97,4432.327,4441.503,Lastly the amendment would modify section 2 to require the superintendent to execute the agreement in consultation with the Council and communicate with Council in a timely fashion.,191,,
675,0.97,4441.503,4443.639,That concludes my summary.,191,,
676,0.97,4443.639,4444.239,Thank you.,192,,
677,0.97,4444.239,4448.71,"Councilmember Herbold, you are recognized in order to move your proposed amendment 6.",192,,
678,0.97,4448.71,4450.312,Thank you so much.,193,,
679,0.97,4450.312,4454.55,I move amendment 6 --,193,,
680,0.97,4454.55,4455.05,Second.,194,,
681,0.97,4455.05,4457.019,Thank you.,195,,
682,0.97,4457.019,4464.593,"Has been moved and Seconded, so Councilmember Herbold is the sponsor.",195,,
683,0.97,4464.593,4468.964,Can you please address this amendment?,195,,
684,0.97,4468.964,4470.232,"Happy to do so, Madam chair.",196,,
685,0.97,4470.232,4477.339,Thank you for the opportunity to sponsor the amendment and address it.,196,,
686,0.97,4477.339,4484.847,"The amendment discussed prior to this one, amendment five, also deals with the long-range plan.",196,,
687,0.97,4484.847,4498.493,Councilmember Strauss's amendment I think rightfully dealt with important issues about participation associated with the development of the long-range plan and is representing community members in his district.,196,,
688,0.97,4498.493,4511.073,"This amendment is different, but it is, I think, complementary in that we are focusing on issues of Council oversight.",196,,
689,0.97,4511.073,4528.924,"I really appreciate my colleagues on the Council, who represent neighbors and their efforts to sponsor good amendments that are in response to issues that constituents have raised.",196,,
690,0.97,4528.924,4558.453,"And this is one that is really more focused on broader, again, principle of Governance and ensuring the Council's ability to exercise its critical oversight function as it relates to the complex agreement that routinely attracts significant comment and concern and include significant investments of resources that relate to City- owned property.",196,,
691,0.97,4558.453,4569.564,"So under the proposed agreement, the zoo will submit its proposed long-range plan to the city within five years of signing the agreement.",196,,
692,0.97,4569.564,4585.581,"The long-range plan, as we know, have substantial changes to land owned by the city both at the Seattle location and that the additional property owned by the city outside the city limits.",196,,
693,0.97,4585.581,4590.385,The zoo is considering Off-Site animal feeding and custody at that location.,196,,
694,0.97,4590.385,4602.064,"The plan will cover the intent to move to the use of that area, that land.",196,,
695,0.97,4602.064,4612.274,"The long-range plan also includes changes that touch on animal welfare, including changes to the habitat and exhibits.",196,,
696,0.97,4612.274,4616.878,"Finally, structural changes to the areas.",196,,
697,0.97,4616.878,4631.526,"Since the term of the proposed agreement thus far is 20 years, we have seen for the life of the current agreement, the state of research regarding Zoos has changed significantly.",196,,
698,0.97,4631.526,4633.128,It is reasonable to think that this will continue.,196,,
699,0.97,4633.128,4664.159,A Touchpoint at five years--I really appreciate everybody's effort to clean up the potential unintended consequences of this amendment and working to address them by permitting the items to come forward that don't rise to the occasion or rise to the need that they have to be approved.,196,,
700,0.97,4664.159,4674.169,Such as the minor construction repairs that were mentioned.,196,,
701,0.97,4674.169,4700.062,"I just want to sum up that requiring Council approval of the long-range plan, we are building it in where the public will have the opportunity to raise concern and Council will have an opportunity to exercise reasonable oversight of significant changes to the zoo that may have impact to its operation, animals, or financial health of the agreement.",196,,
702,0.97,4700.062,4718.18,"Without this, the only mechanism for ongoing Council oversight is through our annual cycle when we consider appropriation for the zoo and is not the most effective or efficient method of dealing with planning oversight.",196,,
703,0.97,4718.18,4728.19,I hope to gain a majority of my committee colleagues support on this amendment.,196,,
704,0.97,4728.19,4728.49,Thank you.,196,,
705,0.97,4728.49,4750.946,"I will add I had a chance to read the changes and I agree with you on some of the changes we already made and benefits we adopted on ongoing oversight and long-term planning and also clarification of the superintendent's responsibilities and also require them to communicate with Council in a timely fashion, so I thank you for that.",197,,
706,0.97,4750.946,4760.455,Are there other questions or concerns or anything we want to ask Councilmember Herbold or Brian before we vote?,197,,
707,0.97,4760.455,4762.924,"Thank you very much, Madam chair.",198,,
708,0.97,4762.924,4771.066,"I want to make sure I am clear, Madam chair.",198,,
709,0.97,4771.066,4777.139,"The amendment to amendment six, the version in front of us, meet some of the issues that you addressed.",198,,
710,0.97,4777.139,4780.775,"I also want to double check with the zoo, that some of those concerns had potentially been addressed.",198,,
711,0.97,4780.775,4791.353,"I just want to make sure this has been workshop and it sounds like it has, but do you mind if I ask members of the zoo for feedback on amendment six?",198,,
712,0.97,4791.353,4792.554,Is that acceptable?,198,,
713,0.97,4792.554,4796.858,"Absolutely, go ahead.",199,,
714,0.97,4796.858,4803.765,That is the extent of my question.,200,,
715,0.97,4803.765,4809.805,Is it workable with the partners from the zoo and Councilmember Herbold if you have other context as well from conversations that you have had --,200,,
716,0.97,4809.805,4835.797,"So, we had declined support for this amendment, because literally this changes a number of issues that have been addressed in the previous amendment in a Proactive way, of the Council being engaged in the discussion of the Proactive engagement in the community participation plan.",201,,
717,0.97,4835.797,4849.811,This amendment adds an additional layer of revisions and changes that can potentially complicate the long- range plan.,201,,
718,0.97,4849.811,4868.763,The city and the Council already have the final word on the approval by the appropriation cycle they have every year and also by determination language that exists in many parts of the agreement.,201,,
719,0.97,4868.763,4885.58,The additional discussion about the long-range plan discussion really is adding conflict in terms of driving capital improvements.,201,,
720,0.97,4885.58,4897.792,"To put it in perspective, also, capital improvements to the zoo have been mostly, largely paid by the nonprofit society that operates the zoo on behalf of the city.",201,,
721,0.97,4897.792,4907.302,Most capital improvements are from its own fundraising.,201,,
722,0.97,4907.302,4928.023,"So in a sense, the implementation of the long- range plan over the past 20 years and likely the implementation of the long- range plan that will happen over the next 20 years is contributed by the society on behalf of the city on those buildings and improvements are owned by the city themselves.",201,,
723,0.97,4928.023,4936.598,So those are our arguments on that amendment.,201,,
724,0.97,4936.598,4939.234,"Dr. Grajal, thank you and I am glad you brought that up.",202,,
725,0.97,4939.234,4949.611,I was looking at my notes on what I understand that the zoo and parks agreed upon and I want to give the superintendent another chance to respond as well.,202,,
726,0.97,4949.611,4956.952,"Thank you for that and I also agree with Dr. Grajal, we don't support this amendment.",203,,
727,0.97,4956.952,4972.0,"It really is a pretty robust process the way it is set up and gives us an opportunity to work with the zoo and with the additional engagement opportunities for community members, I think it provides a good process.",203,,
728,0.97,4972.0,4978.239,This is an agreement directly between the Department of parks and recreation with the zoo.,203,,
729,0.97,4978.239,4987.582,"I think we have many other contracts across the system, including large ones like one of the witnesses talked about.",203,,
730,0.97,4987.582,4996.491,They also have a large operation.,203,,
731,0.97,4996.491,5006.067,This would also create challenges for us to bring any strategic plan to the long- range plan and any of our partners and contractors.,203,,
732,0.97,5006.067,5012.374,I do want to reiterate that the Council has the authority to approve.,203,,
733,0.97,5012.374,5023.118,As well as in its role for the governing board.,203,,
734,0.97,5023.118,5034.295,"Let me pose a question to both of you, Dr. Grajal and superintendent.",204,,
735,0.97,5034.295,5038.967,"Again I spoke a little too soon, because I was looking at my sheet of paper which I confused with another amendment.",204,,
736,0.97,5038.967,5041.436,"Not that I don't think your ideas are good, Councilmember Herbold.",204,,
737,0.97,5041.436,5042.437,What is our response?,204,,
738,0.97,5042.437,5049.544,Is it fair to say that amendment number six perhaps is redundant or not needed?,204,,
739,0.97,5049.544,5056.051,Because we have all of those other measures within the contract that will address this that you feel is sufficient?,204,,
740,0.97,5056.051,5063.758,Is that fair to say?,204,,
741,0.97,5063.758,5081.843,"I would say, we already, the zoo from our point of view, we have the review of the long- range plan with very defined and strong community participation plan that is defined in amendment number five.",205,,
742,0.97,5081.843,5100.095,"We also have the approval by the parks and recreation Department and the parks governing board and we also have the additional review of all of the environmental laws and regulations that exist, with the city of Seattle.",205,,
743,0.97,5100.095,5115.91,"The long-range plan makes commitments to community workforce agreement with the unions to green Sustainability, to the conservation of water and electricity.",205,,
744,0.97,5115.91,5141.336,"In a sense, the plan has, in our view, enough points of participation and Proactive engagement, in a way that the process will work from the base, into a product that everybody can live with and everybody can move on.",205,,
745,0.97,5141.336,5156.751,"We believe that between amendment five in the existing language in the agreement, we have enough strength in the community participation in the process, for a successful long- range plan that can be approved by the community and the city.",205,,
746,0.97,5156.751,5157.752,Well said.,206,,
747,0.97,5157.752,5171.132,Another piece is that we included in the existing proposed agreement that the Department of parks and recreation would be very much involved in that process of developing.,206,,
748,0.97,5171.132,5175.67,It's not just waiting for a plan to be submitted.,206,,
749,0.97,5175.67,5199.694,"We actually have representatives on this group developing this plan, so all of the expertise our team brings, whether it is on the capital project side, the understanding of zoning and other potential issues that could be impacted by a long-range plan at the zoo, we will be very much engaged with that and work with the zoo to ensure they are headed in the right direction and would not do anything that would run afoul of existing law.",206,,
750,0.97,5199.694,5202.931,I want to clear something up.,207,,
751,0.97,5202.931,5212.774,"I know that in 2021, the metropolitan park district or the Seattle park district, we are now funding the annual operations that support routine maintenance.",207,,
752,0.97,5212.774,5214.375,Is that included in the long- term plan?,207,,
753,0.97,5214.375,5219.814,I think it depends and I will defer to Dr. Grajal.,208,,
754,0.97,5219.814,5231.125,"I think it is sort of the long term vision for the zoo that would likely include some of the greatest, significant capital projects.",208,,
755,0.97,5231.125,5231.726,"Again, I don't know.",208,,
756,0.97,5231.726,5238.499,Our commitment is the ongoing operations and support.,208,,
757,0.97,5238.499,5242.704,And as much as that is part of their plan.,208,,
758,0.97,5242.704,5244.138,Correct me if I am wrong.,209,,
759,0.97,5244.138,5257.719,I went back and looked at 2019 when we did the fund source for certain functions and capital projects and minor functions and long-range planning and policy.,209,,
760,0.97,5257.719,5270.498,"I guess if I could in a shorthand way, it is fair to say that Seattle city council will be involved through different mechanisms and certainly Seattle parks and Rec and the board of parks, involved in long-range planning.",209,,
761,0.97,5270.498,5279.073,"That it does not just get dropped en Masse, correct?",209,,
762,0.97,5279.073,5281.075,"Councilmember Herbold, is there anything you would like to add?",209,,
763,0.97,5281.075,5287.582,"I appreciate, Madam chair, the clarification, but it does not even come to us, right?",210,,
764,0.97,5287.582,5291.052,Under the current scheme.,210,,
765,0.97,5291.052,5317.812,"I think the fact that we are making a commitment for $250 million on a 92 acre public asset that is owned by the city, I can't fathom why we would not want to maintain Council oversight of the long- range plan.",210,,
766,0.97,5317.812,5328.623,Participation in the development of the plan on behalf of individuals that we select is not oversight.,210,,
767,0.97,5328.623,5329.223,That is participation.,210,,
768,0.97,5329.223,5329.624,It is useful.,210,,
769,0.97,5329.624,5344.839,"It is great that we are creating a structure that will include participation of individuals that we identify and individuals representing Council, but that is not oversight.",210,,
770,0.97,5344.839,5349.61,Oversight is the plan coming to us and our approval of the plan.,210,,
771,0.97,5349.61,5357.452,"The idea that we would not do that, because there is a budget process, again, I don't understand that.",210,,
772,0.97,5357.452,5376.571,"Why would we want to subject our budget process to being derailed by folks who have concerns around the proposal for funding the zoo, as we are committing to do?",210,,
773,0.97,5376.571,5381.576,Because issues in the long- range plan are not being addressed.,210,,
774,0.97,5381.576,5406.267,"I feel like, in an effort to streamline the decision-making, the zoo and superintendent are not considering the consequences of potentially not having this plan come to us and you think this process has been a headache?",210,,
775,0.97,5406.267,5432.026,"Boy, if we are stuck in budget with a bunch of folks who feel that we are not adequately exercising oversight of the long-range plan and they are asking us not to provide funding, that is not a situation that any of us, supporters of the zoo, want to see us in, calm budget process.",210,,
776,0.97,5432.026,5435.096,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",211,,
777,0.97,5435.096,5439.333,"Seeing no further questions, I will call for a vote.",211,,
778,0.97,5439.333,5444.338,"Clerk, will you please call the role for adoption on number six?",211,,
779,0.97,5444.338,5445.139,1021.,212,,
780,0.97,5445.139,5450.545,Yes.,213,,
781,0.97,5450.545,5450.945,Mosqueda.,214,,
782,0.97,5450.945,5451.345,No.,215,,
783,0.97,5451.345,5451.746,Sawant.,216,,
784,0.97,5451.746,5453.948,Yes.,217,,
785,0.97,5453.948,5454.949,1027.,218,,
786,0.97,5454.949,5459.453,Yes.,219,,
787,0.97,5459.453,5460.054,Chair Juarez.,220,,
788,0.97,5460.054,5460.454,No.,221,,
789,0.97,5460.454,5468.162,"Three in favor, two opposed.",222,,
790,0.97,5468.162,5473.668,"So the motion passes, correct?",223,,
791,0.97,5473.668,5474.469,Yes it does.,224,,
792,0.97,5474.469,5483.244,The motion carries and amendment six is adopted and we will move on.,225,,
793,0.97,5483.244,5484.045,Two amendment number seven.,225,,
794,0.97,5484.045,5485.346,"I apologize for the confusion, too.",225,,
795,0.97,5485.346,5487.815,"I was looking at my wrong notes, so I apologize, Councilmember Herbold.",225,,
796,0.97,5487.815,5492.82,"We have before us, amendment number seven.",225,,
797,0.97,5492.82,5494.188,Do you want to ts up?,225,,
798,0.97,5494.188,5498.493,"Yes, thank you.",226,,
799,0.97,5498.493,5500.695,It is sponsored by Councilmember Sawant and relates to public benefits.,226,,
800,0.97,5500.695,5515.309,"It would modify section 11.1 to provide that the value of public benefits shall escalate each year according to the increase in the consumer price index, consistent with the escalation specified in the proposed agreement.",226,,
801,0.97,5515.309,5516.31,And that concludes my summary.,226,,
802,0.97,5516.31,5520.615,"Thank you, Brian.",227,,
803,0.97,5520.615,5528.322,"Councilmember Sawant, you are recognized to move your proposed agreement.",227,,
804,0.97,5528.322,5528.723,Thank you.,228,,
805,0.97,5528.723,5530.491,You are able to hear me?,228,,
806,0.97,5530.491,5534.128,I move amendment seven to the proposed vote.,228,,
807,0.97,5534.128,5537.231,Second.,229,,
808,0.97,5537.231,5544.939,"It has been moved and Seconded and Councilmember Sawant, do you want to speak to it?",230,,
809,0.97,5544.939,5553.447,Thank you.,231,,
810,0.97,5553.447,5556.884,This amendment would require the zoo to increase public benefits agreed to in the contract with inflation.,231,,
811,0.97,5556.884,5559.82,The contract automatically increases the city funding for the zoo with inflation.,231,,
812,0.97,5559.82,5578.406,"This is the commitment made in the contract for the next 20 to 30 years, so it seems to make sense to me that the public benefit, like free, low income tickets, which the city is effectively funding, should increase by the same proportion.",231,,
813,0.97,5578.406,5582.476,This is a 20 year contract that has been extended for an additional 10 years.,231,,
814,0.97,5582.476,5587.214,30 years of inflation.,231,,
815,0.97,5587.214,5589.684,"If you look at the cumulative effect, it will be dramatic.",231,,
816,0.97,5589.684,5597.591,"Úthe value of $100 30 years ago is $270 today, nearly triple.",231,,
817,0.97,5597.591,5606.267,"If the city funding for the zoo triples over the next 20 years, so should the subsidy for free tickets and other related public benefits.",231,,
818,0.97,5606.267,5609.37,Thank you.,231,,
819,0.97,5609.37,5614.609,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",232,,
820,0.97,5614.609,5616.978,Are there additional comments regarding Amndment number seven?,232,,
821,0.97,5616.978,5623.784,"Seeing none, will the clerk please call the roll on adoption of amendment number seven?",232,,
822,0.97,5623.784,5624.618,Herbold.,233,,
823,0.97,5624.618,5625.319,Yes.,234,,
824,0.97,5625.319,5631.092,1033.,235,,
825,0.97,5631.092,5631.525,Aye.,236,,
826,0.97,5631.525,5631.926,Sawant.,237,,
827,0.97,5631.926,5634.929,Yes.,238,,
828,0.97,5634.929,5635.329,Pedersen.,239,,
829,0.97,5635.329,5635.93,Abstain.,240,,
830,0.97,5635.93,5644.505,Chair Juarez.,241,,
831,0.97,5644.505,5644.905,Yes.,242,,
832,0.97,5644.905,5646.407,"Four in favor, one opposed, one Abstained.",243,,
833,0.97,5646.407,5648.242,The motion carries and is adopted.,244,,
834,0.97,5648.242,5651.412,Let's move on to Amendmen number eight.,244,,
835,0.97,5651.412,5657.718,"Brian, I will let you speak to it and then I will have Councilmember Mosqueda discuss it.",244,,
836,0.97,5657.718,5662.757,Thank you very much.,245,,
837,0.97,5662.757,5672.533,Amendment number eight is sponsored by Councilmember Mosqueda and this is one that has a new version since the one distributed in yesterday's staff memo.,245,,
838,0.97,5672.533,5678.439,"As shown on the slide, the version I will be describing is version number five.",245,,
839,0.97,5678.439,5690.084,"This amendment would add a new section, 11.3.6, to the proposed agreement, that would require the society to cause the entity operating or managing the food operation of the zoo to enter into a labor peace agreement.",245,,
840,0.97,5690.084,5695.089,And that concludes my summary.,245,,
841,0.97,5695.089,5695.89,"Thank you, Brian.",246,,
842,0.97,5695.89,5700.661,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you are recognized to speak to amendment.",246,,
843,0.97,5700.661,5705.399,Thank you and thank you for recognizing we are on version number five.,247,,
844,0.97,5705.399,5711.038,"I want to thank my office, along with the team at Councilmember Juarez's office.",247,,
845,0.97,5711.038,5715.409,Along with unite here.,247,,
846,0.97,5715.409,5721.682,Members had an opportunity to talk with us about including a labor peace provision in the agreement.,247,,
847,0.97,5721.682,5739.934,"The city of Seattle frequently includes various forms of labor harmony and peace agreement language when they have the ability to promote peace, including the ability for several major contracts, such as the waterfront agreement and the latest Iteration of the levee.",247,,
848,0.97,5739.934,5751.512,This version 5 of amendment eight would require the woodland park zoo to cause any entity operating or managing food and beverage concessions at the zoo to enter into a labor peace agreement at the earliest opportunity.,247,,
849,0.97,5751.512,5761.055,We understand the zoo was midway through its contract with the current food and beverage operator and will have the opportunity when the contract is up.,247,,
850,0.97,5761.055,5778.072,"I am also very supportive of working with the zoo and the food and beverage operator, levy restaurants, to see whether there is an opportunity to enter such a peace agreement sooner in the contract renewal and I look forward to further conversations to see if that can be accomplished outside the amendment.",247,,
851,0.97,5778.072,5792.186,"Thank you again, challenged--thank you for how to refine the language and to our parks partners on the line.",247,,
852,0.97,5792.186,5793.454,Thank you to Councilmember Juarez's team.,247,,
853,0.97,5793.454,5802.096,"The zoo and parks team on the line here, for your work to create an amendment I am hopeful we can all be supportive of.",247,,
854,0.97,5802.096,5803.631,I am thankful for that collaboration.,247,,
855,0.97,5803.631,5809.804,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",248,,
856,0.97,5809.804,5813.507,Is there anyone else who would like to address Councilmember Mosqueda's amendment day,248,,
857,0.97,5813.507,5824.285,"I apologize, if Councilmember Mosqueda moved that, I missed it.",249,,
858,0.97,5824.285,5826.587,"Can we get that amendment eight, version 5, moved and Seconded?",249,,
859,0.97,5826.587,5827.521,"Sorry about that, chair.",250,,
860,0.97,5827.521,5833.127,"I moved to consider amendment eight, version 5.",250,,
861,0.97,5833.127,5835.229,Second.,251,,
862,0.97,5835.229,5840.734,"All right, so it has been moved and Seconded and the sponsor has discussed it.",252,,
863,0.97,5840.734,5854.348,"As of this point, I do not see any other questions or concerns, so I will ask the clerk to call the roll on adoption of amendment eight, version 5.",252,,
864,0.97,5854.348,5854.748,Herbold.,253,,
865,0.97,5854.748,5856.35,Yes.,254,,
866,0.97,5856.35,5856.951,Mosqueda.,255,,
867,0.97,5856.951,5857.751,Aye.,256,,
868,0.97,5857.751,5861.455,Sawant.,257,,
869,0.97,5861.455,5861.855,Yes.,258,,
870,0.97,5861.855,5864.959,"Five in favor, none opposed.",259,,
871,0.97,5864.959,5871.565,The motion passes and the amendment is added.,260,,
872,0.97,5871.565,5872.633,Is that the right word?,260,,
873,0.97,5872.633,5876.47,"Sorry about that, I am getting my times mixed up.",260,,
874,0.97,5876.47,5883.978,"All right, we are moving onto amendment number nine, regarding records.",260,,
875,0.97,5883.978,5890.284,"Brian, when you're done talking, I have a few things I want to say before I pass it to Councilmember Sawant.",260,,
876,0.97,5890.284,5890.684,Go ahead.,260,,
877,0.97,5890.684,5895.789,Amendment number nine relates to the definition of zoo animal records.,261,,
878,0.97,5895.789,5907.968,"The amendment would modify the definition for all records related to zoo animals, instead of just those records related to the veterinary treatment of the animals.",261,,
879,0.97,5907.968,5909.77,That concludes my summary.,261,,
880,0.97,5909.77,5918.112,"Councilmember Sawant, before I recognize you for your proposed amendment, I want to share where I am headed.",262,,
881,0.97,5918.112,5929.523,"I am not inclined to support this without a little bit more, but I do want to hear what you have to say in regards to your amendment and then I will probably follow up.",262,,
882,0.97,5929.523,5936.83,"With that, Councilmember Sawant, you are recognized in order to move your proposed amendment number nine.",262,,
883,0.97,5936.83,5939.667,"Thank you, I move amendment number nine to the bill day",263,,
884,0.97,5939.667,5943.537,Second.,264,,
885,0.97,5943.537,5944.338,Moved and Seconded.,265,,
886,0.97,5944.338,5949.41,"Councilmember Sawant, you are recognized to address your amendment.",265,,
887,0.97,5949.41,5952.68,Thank you and thank you Councilmember Pedersen for the second.,266,,
888,0.97,5952.68,5961.155,This amendment adjusts the definition of what logs are considered public records.,266,,
889,0.97,5961.155,5974.468,"Many constituents care deeply about the animals at the zoo and have, in the past, been very frustrated by the difficulties they have had in getting records from the zoo.",266,,
890,0.97,5974.468,5976.804,There were even lawsuits over what counted as a public record.,266,,
891,0.97,5976.804,5986.58,I cannot think of any good reason for the zoo to refuse to release records about the animals and restricting animal records subject to public disclosure.,266,,
892,0.97,5986.58,5999.159,"In my mind, serves no purpose, and is something that we thought about and talked to constituents about and it seems like the more straightforward thing to do.",266,,
893,0.97,5999.159,6004.264,The simplest solution being to make any records related to the zoo animals public.,266,,
894,0.97,6004.264,6028.822,"I have a concern that increasing the records considered public records could increase the number of records that there could be future lawsuits over the release of, but again, it's sort of points to the same point of, if the woodland park zoo released the records request, then I don't see how legal liability could become a problem.",266,,
895,0.97,6028.822,6036.53,"If the institution complied with the request I don't see why it should be a problem, thank you.",266,,
896,0.97,6036.53,6036.997,Thank you.,267,,
897,0.97,6036.997,6037.931,I withhold my comments now.,267,,
898,0.97,6037.931,6042.636,I appreciate that.,267,,
899,0.97,6042.636,6044.037,It fills in blanks that I had.,267,,
900,0.97,6044.037,6046.707,Is there anything for my colleagues before I make any statements?,267,,
901,0.97,6046.707,6053.013,"All right, not sing anything from my colleagues, Councilmember Sawant, thank you for the amendment.",267,,
902,0.97,6053.013,6061.055,I am familiar with the lawsuit that some folks brought against the zoo regarding public records and I had an opportunity to look at that.,267,,
903,0.97,6061.055,6071.265,Unfortunately today I cannot support your amendment on records that is expanding the definition of zoo animal records to include all records pertaining to all zoo animals.,267,,
904,0.97,6071.265,6092.886,"For me on a practical purpose, the zoo does not have the staff or a Pbr office the way the city Council has or the executive legislative government has or resources to support every single request and there are a lot of requests.",267,,
905,0.97,6092.886,6094.455,That is my number one concern.,267,,
906,0.97,6094.455,6105.165,"Number two, besides not having the staff and time, I believe it is still a transparent system if the records are reasonable in relationship to the zoo animals and not anything else.",267,,
907,0.97,6105.165,6127.321,"Some of the issues, and I actually talked to some of the constituents and subject matter experts and zoo folks and what they were concerned about is this invites wide interpretation that could harm the day-to-day operation of the primary responsibility of running a zoo.",267,,
908,0.97,6127.321,6130.991,"Board meetings are open to the public, as are the agenda and notes.",267,,
909,0.97,6130.991,6142.536,"Also, zoo staff are accessible and now we passed more amendments to expand community participation, so there is even more transparency.",267,,
910,0.97,6142.536,6153.747,"Also, vet records are already available and accessible to the public and also I learned today that finances are publicly presented in annual filings.",267,,
911,0.97,6153.747,6167.294,"So for me I think there is enough transparency for any community member, if indeed they have a reasonable request to the woodland park zoo, regarding any animal issue or zoo records.",267,,
912,0.97,6167.294,6173.467,So for that practical reason I will be voting no on this.,267,,
913,0.97,6173.467,6176.47,"With that, Madam clerk, can we call the role?",267,,
914,0.97,6176.47,6176.87,Herbold.,268,,
915,0.97,6176.87,6182.576,No.,269,,
916,0.97,6182.576,6183.176,Mosqueda.,270,,
917,0.97,6183.176,6183.443,No.,271,,
918,0.97,6183.443,6183.844,Sawant.,272,,
919,0.97,6183.844,6187.08,Yes.,273,,
920,0.97,6187.08,6187.414,Pedersen.,274,,
921,0.97,6187.414,6188.248,No.,275,,
922,0.97,6188.248,6193.587,Chair Juarez.,276,,
923,0.97,6193.587,6194.188,No.,277,,
924,0.97,6194.188,6199.259,"One in favor, four opposed.",278,,
925,0.97,6199.259,6202.896,"So the amendment fails, is not adopted, and we move onto amendment number 10.",279,,
926,0.97,6202.896,6214.107,Which is animal correction correct?,279,,
927,0.97,6214.107,6217.177,"So, amendment 10 is sponsored by Councilmember Sawant and relates to the animal collection.",280,,
928,0.97,6217.177,6225.619,The proposed agreement as currently written in 12.3 requires the society to comply with the requirements of Federal state and local laws and policies.,280,,
929,0.97,6225.619,6236.63,It also requires the society to comply by the guidelines of the Aca.,280,,
930,0.97,6236.63,6249.643,"This would modify that section to require the society to comply with ordinances, resolutions, executive orders or other policies established by the city affecting the breeding, sale, or disposition of zoo animals.",280,,
931,0.97,6249.643,6259.753,"It would also clarify if there is a conflict between guidelines and policies of the Aca and governmental laws and policies, the governmental laws and policies shall take precedence.",280,,
932,0.97,6259.753,6260.821,And that concludes my summary.,280,,
933,0.97,6260.821,6265.058,Thank you.,281,,
934,0.97,6265.058,6270.764,"Councilmember Sawant, you are recognized to move your proposed amendment number 10.",281,,
935,0.97,6270.764,6276.67,"Thank you, I move amendment number 10 related to the disposition of zoo animals.",282,,
936,0.97,6276.67,6277.27,Second.,283,,
937,0.97,6277.27,6278.739,It has been moved and Seconded.,284,,
938,0.97,6278.739,6284.678,"Councilmember Sawant, do you want to speak to your amendment?",284,,
939,0.97,6284.678,6285.379,Thank you.,285,,
940,0.97,6285.379,6296.556,"In 2018, hundreds or even thousands of people in Seattle reached out to the city council because they are extremely concerned about the welfare of the three elephants at the time of the woodland park zoo.",285,,
941,0.97,6296.556,6309.77,These community members had attempted to raise their concerns with the zoo administration without success and then appealed to the democratically elected body of the city council for help.,285,,
942,0.97,6309.77,6321.915,"These constituents were absolutely correct about the health of the elephant confirmed through public reports, because the Zoos are just too small for elephants.",285,,
943,0.97,6321.915,6334.928,"My office prepared legislation at the time to require the zoo to transfer the elephants to a sanctuary that agreed to accept them, in support of the constituents.",285,,
944,0.97,6334.928,6338.398,But the majority of the Council at that time did not agree to support it.,285,,
945,0.97,6338.398,6352.846,"Ultimately there was sufficient public pressure to compel the woodland park zoo to transfer the elephants, but rather than to the sanctuary, they were transferred to another zoo in Oklahoma city and all of that was too little, too late.",285,,
946,0.97,6352.846,6354.815,One of the elephants died shortly after.,285,,
947,0.97,6354.815,6360.62,I believe I am the only Councilmember from that time still in office.,285,,
948,0.97,6360.62,6377.471,"However, that experience was convincing to me that our constituents should have an Avenue for some form of democratic influence over the zoo on this question of disposition of animals, if needed.",285,,
949,0.97,6377.471,6382.342,I would not expect that the Council or parks Department would get involved in Day-To- day operations at the zoo.,285,,
950,0.97,6382.342,6390.183,In fact that incident is the only time in the years I have been in office where constituents have demanded action on animal welfare at the zoo.,285,,
951,0.97,6390.183,6399.393,"It was extreme, and unusual thing, but when that does happen, it was gravely important, as we saw from the outcome.",285,,
952,0.97,6399.393,6407.067,"When that happens, constituents should be able to reach out to an elected official with the power to act, which is what this amendment would do.",285,,
953,0.97,6407.067,6407.467,Thank you.,285,,
954,0.97,6407.467,6411.705,Thank you.,286,,
955,0.97,6411.705,6412.239,Councilmember Herbold.,286,,
956,0.97,6412.239,6414.574,Thank you.,287,,
957,0.97,6414.574,6432.626,"So I know there has been a lot of concern among advocates that in the past, Councilmembers were unaware that they had the authority to pass legislation regarding the disposition of animals and we heard from public comment about that, today.",287,,
958,0.97,6432.626,6441.401,"But that is simply, as I understand it, not accurate of what the Council's authority was in that instance.",287,,
959,0.97,6441.401,6452.746,"Since that time, as mentioned, there has been--the only Councilmember here from that time.",287,,
960,0.97,6452.746,6466.46,But my research into what did happen in 2015 has helped me get a greater understanding of this issue.,287,,
961,0.97,6466.46,6472.065,The advocates have raised the issue.,287,,
962,0.97,6472.065,6479.806,The agreement would require that the zoo comply with all local laws regarding animal disposition.,287,,
963,0.97,6479.806,6495.789,"This means Council could, in the future, consider passing different animal disposition policies that would apply to, for instance, zoo animals and other operators of animal attractions.",287,,
964,0.97,6495.789,6509.002,"Further, the approval of the long-range plan amendment is another appropriate opportunity to exercise oversight on plans for animal habitat and welfare.",287,,
965,0.97,6509.002,6526.52,"With the language that is included, I am comfortable that the proposed agreement to preserve sufficient oversight, consistent with the city's role as zoo owner, not zoo operator.",287,,
966,0.97,6526.52,6534.227,And I really appreciate the hard work that the advocates have done to raise this issue of our authority.,287,,
967,0.97,6534.227,6543.136,Related to laws and regulation regarding animal disposition and treatment.,287,,
968,0.97,6543.136,6561.021,"So, I don't believe this amendment is necessary to meet the proponents goals, given my understanding of the existing language, as well as the language that has recently, in Committee, Ben agreed to for the long-range plan agreement.",287,,
969,0.97,6561.021,6566.259,I understand that there are concerns with the language.,287,,
970,0.97,6566.259,6588.381,"Where I am at is not so much that I have concern, it is more that I feel like what we included is sufficient to meet the goals and if there are concerns that I don't understand, I am more comfortable sticking with the language that I have before us.",287,,
971,0.97,6588.381,6589.249,Thank you.,287,,
972,0.97,6589.249,6590.083,Thank you.,288,,
973,0.97,6590.083,6595.221,Is there anyone who would like to share before I state my position?,288,,
974,0.97,6595.221,6607.3,"All right, again, Councilmember Sawant, I appreciate the work you have done and I know you were here in 2015, but I like to say that a lot has changed since 2015.",288,,
975,0.97,6607.3,6613.807,"I cannot support this amendment on animal collection, mainly on the same grounds as a shared earlier.",288,,
976,0.97,6613.807,6629.289,"Not just practicality, but I don't think city policy can preempt Federal, state, regional, or zoo accreditation authority, that we could supplant our own opinions, because we lack the subject matter expertise.",288,,
977,0.97,6629.289,6630.09,We don't run Zoos.,288,,
978,0.97,6630.09,6633.927,We actually have Zoos that do that.,288,,
979,0.97,6633.927,6648.575,"More importantly, when I sat down and met with the zoo leadership and some folks from the parks, my understanding from the zoo, and I would like Dr. Grajal to way and if he can, that this would directly risk accreditation, which is a core requirement of this agreement.",288,,
980,0.97,6648.575,6673.566,"I will let Dr. Grajal speak to the woodland park zoo, the accreditation, the veterinarians, and the work and people they have hired to make this a better zoo and that the zoo already complies with government laws and regulations, which is extensive and protects not only the animals, the operations and the zoo animals.",288,,
981,0.97,6673.566,6686.479,"So one of us, I think all of you received a one-page memo from the zoo that was circulated to outline some of the issues and concerns.",288,,
982,0.97,6686.479,6688.014,For me this is really a Dealbreaker.,288,,
983,0.97,6688.014,6692.852,It is not practical and this goes to the core.,288,,
984,0.97,6692.852,6701.194,I don't want to risk the woodland park zoo losing accreditation and their status as one of the best Zoos in the country.,288,,
985,0.97,6701.194,6711.104,"I know that is open to discussion or disagreement, but from where I stand in chairing this Committee and the work I've done, I will be voting no.",288,,
986,0.97,6711.104,6717.21,"But will you please respond to anything I said, Councilmember Herbold, or Councilmember Sawant?",288,,
987,0.97,6717.21,6725.518,I think Councilmember Herbold summarized it well.,289,,
988,0.97,6725.518,6727.387,We are in compliance with laws and regulations.,289,,
989,0.97,6727.387,6735.528,"There is enough oversight and control over the control of the collection, including the long- range plan.",289,,
990,0.97,6735.528,6745.338,The main thing that we have against this amendment is the idea that regulations will take precedence over accreditation.,289,,
991,0.97,6745.338,6751.344,"Just remind you, accreditation is one of the core elements of this agreement.",289,,
992,0.97,6751.344,6760.353,"So if future regulations contradict and jeopardize accreditation, the zoo would need to terminate the agreement as specified.",289,,
993,0.97,6760.353,6779.372,"So in a sense I think it would be up to the Council to provide any rules, regulations, or decrees that they feel that they need to, but if those regulations contradict our policies, then the agreement will probably Miss one of the core elements, which is accreditation for the zoo.",289,,
994,0.97,6779.372,6783.476,So that is our position.,289,,
995,0.97,6783.476,6786.279,"Thank you, Dr. Grajal.",290,,
996,0.97,6786.279,6788.681,Anyone else before we go to a vote?,290,,
997,0.97,6788.681,6791.184,Councilmember Sawant.,290,,
998,0.97,6791.184,6801.494,"Just briefly, this whole thing of the risk of losing accreditation.",291,,
999,0.97,6801.494,6806.766,I don't agree that the zoo would be at the risk of losing accreditation.,291,,
1000,0.97,6806.766,6812.505,"In fact, the zoo used to be run by the city itself, so I am not sure that applies.",291,,
1001,0.97,6812.505,6824.818,"Obviously I would not support any kind of move that would have that risk, but in my understanding this amendment does not have that risk.",291,,
1002,0.97,6824.818,6841.0,"And just on the question brought up on does the Council have that authority anyway, I feel like a lot of that is a little bit of a gray area.",291,,
1003,0.97,6841.0,6850.51,"Constituents we have spoken to who are Long-Standing animal rights activists, these are people who have lived in the city and paid attention to the zoo for years.",291,,
1004,0.97,6850.51,6858.218,"They felt this amendment was necessary, so they brought it forward.",291,,
1005,0.97,6858.218,6859.819,There is some difference of opinion on that.,291,,
1006,0.97,6859.819,6862.855,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",292,,
1007,0.97,6862.855,6869.762,I appreciate that you listen to the animal advocates.,292,,
1008,0.97,6869.762,6871.564,With that I will move forward for the vote.,292,,
1009,0.97,6871.564,6874.467,Will the clerk please call the roll on adoption of amendment 10?,292,,
1010,0.97,6874.467,6874.868,Herbold.,293,,
1011,0.97,6874.868,6875.268,No.,294,,
1012,0.97,6875.268,6880.54,Mosqueda.,295,,
1013,0.97,6880.54,6880.94,No.,296,,
1014,0.97,6880.94,6881.374,Sawant.,297,,
1015,0.97,6881.374,6882.475,Yes.,298,,
1016,0.97,6882.475,6885.979,Pedersen.,299,,
1017,0.97,6885.979,6886.346,Abstained.,300,,
1018,0.97,6886.346,6887.58,Chair Juarez.,301,,
1019,0.97,6887.58,6889.082,No.,302,,
1020,0.97,6889.082,6893.286,"One in favor, three opposed, one Abstained.",303,,
1021,0.97,6893.286,6903.696,"So the motion fails and, Brian, let's continue on to amendment 11.",304,,
1022,0.97,6903.696,6905.765,"11 and 12, because these are a little bit conflicting.",304,,
1023,0.97,6905.765,6909.736,"So I will let you speak to both of them at the same time, correct?",304,,
1024,0.97,6909.736,6912.405,That is what we will do and then we welcome back.,304,,
1025,0.97,6912.405,6913.206,Thank you.,305,,
1026,0.97,6913.206,6919.679,As you mentioned we have come to the first set of amendments that are competing with each other.,305,,
1027,0.97,6919.679,6927.287,"As you can see, both amendments 11 and 12 relate to the agreement term and the committee cannot most approve only one of these amendments.",305,,
1028,0.97,6927.287,6931.925,I will briefly describe both of them.,305,,
1029,0.97,6931.925,6948.708,"Amendment 11, sponsored by Councilmember Pedersen, which shorten the term of the agreement",305,,
1030,0.97,6953.413,6959.552,Would modify the extension option from allowing one 10 year extension to allowing full extensions as long as those do not exceed the total of 10 years.,306,,
1031,0.97,6959.552,6968.661,Council members want would possible have a term of 30 years in total.,306,,
1032,0.97,6968.661,6982.275,And amendment 12 would also need the super attendance approval subject to the city council approval.,306,,
1033,0.97,6982.275,6983.142,That concludes my summary.,306,,
1034,0.97,6983.142,6993.486,"Since we have on minutes 11 and 12 that are conflicting, but I'm going to do is have each sponsor speak to their amendment and then we will go back and they can move and vote.",307,,
1035,0.97,6993.486,6994.754,Does that sound correct Madam clerk?,307,,
1036,0.97,6994.754,6996.756,That sounds like the best action to take right now.,308,,
1037,0.97,6996.756,7002.462,"With that, Councilmember Pederson you can speak to your amendment.",309,,
1038,0.97,7002.462,7006.699,Thank you chair Juarez.,310,,
1039,0.97,7006.699,7013.606,I support many of the benefits and think the zoo and their team for their hard work.,310,,
1040,0.97,7013.606,7023.116,My family has enjoyed the zoo over the years and I appreciate all that has gone into this proposal.,310,,
1041,0.97,7023.116,7029.822,My amendment is being brought forward in the interest of some believe we could spend even more time analyzing the proposed agreement.,310,,
1042,0.97,7029.822,7046.773,With the recognition that the future is uncertain as society openly debate the relative benefits and goals of urban Zoos over time and locking ourselves into a 30 year agreement which is 20 years plus a 10 year extension not be prudent.,310,,
1043,0.97,7046.773,7054.013,"A lot can change in a decade with technology, education, conservation, our measurement of public benefits and our relationship with the environment.",310,,
1044,0.97,7054.013,7065.458,It is important to note that my amendment still retains the 10 year extension and it is a relatively easy extension because it is approved just by the superintendent and the zoo.,310,,
1045,0.97,7065.458,7075.068,In other words is adjusting the total from 30 years to 20 years.,310,,
1046,0.97,7075.068,7085.044,Given the numerous changes we are making today to the zoo's original proposal I believe shortening the length of the agreement could be considered a Win-Win and enables everyone to Revisit it in 10-20 years instead of 20-30 years.,310,,
1047,0.97,7085.044,7091.484,I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.,310,,
1048,0.97,7091.484,7093.653,Thank you.,310,,
1049,0.97,7093.653,7099.358,Madam clerk to we entertain questions now or do I let the sponsors speak to their Mendment and then go back to the questions before we vote?,311,,
1050,0.97,7099.358,7100.56,It is up to you.,312,,
1051,0.97,7100.56,7106.699,I would suggest having both sponsors present their amendments and then open it up and possibly make the motion to move and vote.,312,,
1052,0.97,7106.699,7110.503,Now I think it is best to have both sponsors speak to their armaments.,312,,
1053,0.97,7110.503,7116.342,Councilmember Sawant can you please speak to your amendment number 12?,313,,
1054,0.97,7116.342,7126.519,Thank you chair Juarez.,314,,
1055,0.97,7126.519,7133.226,"This is an extremely long contract, 20 or 30 years from now who knows what people in Seattle will want to happen with the woodland park zoo.",314,,
1056,0.97,7133.226,7154.547,Uno's will be running the zoo who will be running the parks Department . given that so many people do care about the details of this contract I think this amendment to shorten the initial contract to be 10- 20 years is enough long enough period that makes sense to me.,314,,
1057,0.97,7154.547,7159.218,"As mentioned, amendment 12 addresses the same issue a little differently.",314,,
1058,0.97,7159.218,7168.728,It would require counsel approval for an extension beyond 20 years that I support either approach.,314,,
1059,0.97,7168.728,7178.037,I will be voting yes on than men meant from Councilmember--the amendment from Council member Pederson.,314,,
1060,0.97,7178.037,7184.076,If it does not pass then I will vote amendment 12 for a vote.,314,,
1061,0.97,7184.076,7196.055,What we will do is go back to and men meant number 11 and I will have Councilmember Pederson formally move his amendment and then we will have some comments on that.,315,,
1062,0.97,7196.055,7198.291,Council member Pederson?,315,,
1063,0.97,7198.291,7204.397,I have a process question?,316,,
1064,0.97,7204.397,7214.574,"Just to clarify, because these are mutually exclusive amendments it is possible we will not get to amendment 12.",316,,
1065,0.97,7214.574,7215.408,Is that correct?,316,,
1066,0.97,7215.408,7224.016,If amendment 11 passes then amendment 12 just goes away or is tabled.,316,,
1067,0.97,7224.016,7224.417,Correct.,317,,
1068,0.97,7224.417,7239.432,"If amendment 11 fails, if both of them fail then we just go with the proposed agreement and the 20 year term which is in the contract which you have all seen it will go back to that discussion.",317,,
1069,0.97,7239.432,7258.718,Because of the setup here with these mutually exclusive amendments it creates a situation where we could not be able to go back.,318,,
1070,0.97,7258.718,7262.955,That is what I am concerned about.,318,,
1071,0.97,7262.955,7272.164,I did want to understand a little bit more about the intent of amendment 12 if I could Madam chair?,318,,
1072,0.97,7272.164,7275.735,Let me just say something real quick.,319,,
1073,0.97,7275.735,7278.671,I want to loop back quickly.,319,,
1074,0.97,7278.671,7284.377,There is a reason why Brian put 11 and 12 together in the order he did them.,319,,
1075,0.97,7284.377,7288.681,There is some logic here and why he put 13-15 together.,319,,
1076,0.97,7288.681,7297.256,Because the same issue will come up again and there's a reason why he did it because I had the same confusion that you did.,319,,
1077,0.97,7297.256,7300.493,It didn't seem like it would be fair so I understand what you are getting out there.,319,,
1078,0.97,7300.493,7301.293,But go ahead.,319,,
1079,0.97,7301.293,7316.609,I understand the policy intent of 11 is to take a 20 year term and make it a 10 year term so there's an opportunity to check in.,320,,
1080,0.97,7316.609,7321.314,Is that more or less correct Councilmember Pederson?,320,,
1081,0.97,7321.314,7321.714,Yes.,321,,
1082,0.97,7321.714,7344.57,With 12 I don't understand what the policy objective is that is being served to still have a 20 year agreement but after the 20 years is up as I understand it if there are extensions they would have to come to Council for approval of the extensions?,322,,
1083,0.97,7344.57,7347.64,I'm not sure I understand the policy objective being cleared by 12.,322,,
1084,0.97,7347.64,7364.523,I don't want to be in a situation where I vote for 11 because I think it is better without fully understanding what 12 is trying to get out.,322,,
1085,0.97,7365.591,7371.13,Brian can you respond as well because you had given us some additional notes.,323,,
1086,0.97,7371.13,7377.236,Can we have Councilmember Sawant respond and then Brian please respond to Councilmember Bowles question?,323,,
1087,0.97,7377.236,7380.873,Bryant when you go ahead and say what you want to say and I will go after.,324,,
1088,0.97,7380.873,7387.179,I think I should probably let Councilmember Sawant address it.,325,,
1089,0.97,7387.179,7388.848,I'm happy to answer what it does.,325,,
1090,0.97,7388.848,7391.951,I think Councilmember Herbold summarized it quickly.,325,,
1091,0.97,7391.951,7405.798,"The full 20 year term would happen and my assumption is that if there is some desire to have a little bit more time at the end of it but not just triggering a 10 year extension, that is the intent.",325,,
1092,0.97,7405.798,7412.638,I'm happy to talk about any specifics but Council members want should probably speak to her intent.,325,,
1093,0.97,7412.638,7419.011,Thank you Brian.,326,,
1094,0.97,7419.011,7445.304,I guess the main difference between 11 and 12 is 11 just limits the duration for which the contract applies and both sides get a chance to renew it so to speak.,326,,
1095,0.97,7445.304,7458.017,But in the case of number 12 it is specifically bringing up the question of democratic oversight from the city Council of the question of going over 20 years.,326,,
1096,0.97,7458.017,7462.721,It is not meant to just be an administrative Rubberstamp.,326,,
1097,0.97,7462.721,7471.463,Hopefully that clarifies what the intent of number 12 was.,326,,
1098,0.97,7471.463,7478.17,In terms of effectively of what the outcome will be there's a real overlap between 11 and 12.,326,,
1099,0.97,7478.17,7481.04,That is why I said that my office is fine with either approach.,326,,
1100,0.97,7481.04,7487.379,"And up 11 passes, I intend to support 11 and if it passes I will withdraw number 12.",326,,
1101,0.97,7487.379,7491.717,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,327,,
1102,0.97,7491.717,7498.19,"If there is anymore, I would like to share my opinion.",327,,
1103,0.97,7498.19,7499.458,Thank you Councilmember Pederson.,327,,
1104,0.97,7499.458,7503.696,I will not be supporting either 11 or 12.,327,,
1105,0.97,7503.696,7506.498,Mainly 11 and I will tell you why.,327,,
1106,0.97,7506.498,7524.717,"In my term of being the chair of the zoo, waterfront Seattle center and everything in between in parks, I was looking at other contracts that we have with the city and not the type of ones that are similar to the zoo.",327,,
1107,0.97,7524.717,7532.491,The Seattle Aquarium contract is 20 years and we had many amendments and Addendum's.,327,,
1108,0.97,7532.491,7533.959,The Seattle art museum is 55 years.,327,,
1109,0.97,7533.959,7535.528,Moe high is 30.,327,,
1110,0.97,7535.528,7540.833,The last two are not in the care of animals but the Aquarium certainly is.,327,,
1111,0.97,7540.833,7543.502,These are other local agreements.,327,,
1112,0.97,7543.502,7561.053,"The other issue I have is what I have learned from the zoo and from Seattle parks is that 20 years allows for the appropriate planning for long- term projects acquisition of animals, hiring employees, putting up the different programs they put together.",327,,
1113,0.97,7561.053,7563.856,They need that 20 year span.,327,,
1114,0.97,7563.856,7573.866,"Speaking as a former lawyer that used to draft these things, wait let me go back to something else.",327,,
1115,0.97,7573.866,7576.068,I looked at other Zoos and what was the industry standard.,327,,
1116,0.97,7576.068,7581.44,The industry standard is 20-40 years.,327,,
1117,0.97,7581.44,7584.376,Ours relatively speaking 20 years I think is fair.,327,,
1118,0.97,7584.376,7589.148,We have done it that way before for caring for animals.,327,,
1119,0.97,7589.148,7593.986,The city Council has always retained the power and authority to amend this contract or add Addendum's to this contract.,327,,
1120,0.97,7593.986,7600.092,"In fact we did that in 2004, 2013.",327,,
1121,0.97,7600.092,7621.513,When we passed the metropolitan park district in 2014 we actually went back to 2019 and switched out money from Mpd and in 2021 metropolitan park district funded operations of routine maintenance.,327,,
1122,0.97,7621.513,7632.391,I share some of these examples of instances where we were able in a timely manner to address critical matters or new issues that came up that we could not have anticipated.,327,,
1123,0.97,7632.391,7641.033,"The point of a contract, there will be meeting of the minds and having terms of agreements but to also build in the flexibility that things will change.",327,,
1124,0.97,7641.033,7642.835,I like what Councilmember Herbold said.,327,,
1125,0.97,7642.835,7648.007,I will take exception because I am a lawyer.,327,,
1126,0.97,7648.007,7653.979,"When you have tenure and another tenure, it is not necessarily a check in and that is the danger there for me anyway.",327,,
1127,0.97,7653.979,7657.249,What I was hearing from the zoo and parks in regards to planning.,327,,
1128,0.97,7657.249,7680.739,It is more of a practical approach to amend and have Addendum's and hear more community concerns and still retain control of those 92 acres and be involved with the labor of over 400 employees at the zoo and all the things that come with it.,327,,

1130,0.97,7687.279,7694.586,What I understand from how they put together and what programming comes up.,327,,

1156,0.97,7780.305,7784.176,I move amendment number 12.,336,,
1157,0.97,7784.176,7785.544,Second.,337,,
1158,0.97,7785.544,7791.717,Councilmember Sawant can you fill us in on what you are doing here?,338,,
1159,0.97,7791.717,7794.586,I feel like I have described number 12 already.,339,,
1160,0.97,7794.586,7798.023,I don't have anything new to add.,339,,
1161,0.97,7798.023,7801.76,"I'm sorry, didn't mean to put you on the spot.",340,,
1162,0.97,7801.76,7803.962,Is there something I said that you wanted to respond to.,340,,
1163,0.97,7803.962,7811.17,"With that, Councilmember Sawant are you okay with us moving forward?",340,,
1164,0.97,7811.17,7812.237,Councilmember Herbold has her hand up.,340,,
1165,0.97,7812.237,7823.215,Councilmember Juarez you did a great job of explaining the concern with the 10 year term instead of the 20 year term.,341,,
1166,0.97,7823.215,7837.629,It made me preferred this version which gives certainty to the zoo for the full 10 in that is more than a check in as you say Midway.,341,,
1167,0.97,7837.629,7847.406,"So, it allows the zoo to have the full 20 year agreement.",341,,
1168,0.97,7847.406,7853.645,But requires that extension whether they are tenure extensions or multiple extensions that total 10 years that they would come back to counsel for their approval.,341,,
1169,0.97,7853.645,7861.553,Thank you for experience with how many times this committee has amended the Aquarium contract and then some.,342,,
1170,0.97,7861.553,7867.426,I will leave it at that.,342,,
1171,0.97,7867.426,7871.43,"With that, are there any other comments?",342,,
1172,0.97,7871.43,7875.4,I see none so will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of amendment number 12?,342,,

1178,0.97,7882.474,7882.975,Yes.,343,,
1179,0.97,7882.975,7884.576,Pederson?,343,,
1180,0.97,7884.576,7885.244,Yes.,343,,
1181,0.97,7885.244,7888.48,Chair Juarez?,343,,
1182,0.97,7888.48,7888.68,No.,343,,
1183,0.97,7888.68,7892.384,"Three in favor, two opposed.",343,,
1184,0.97,7892.384,7902.694,So it passes.,344,,
1185,0.97,7903.528,7913.105,"Three in favor, two opposed.",344,,
1186,0.97,7913.105,7916.041,"Okay, the amendment passes so we will move on to amendment number 13.",345,,
1187,0.97,7916.041,7922.114,We have the same issue here that we had with the other ones.,345,,
1188,0.97,7922.114,7944.336,"We have on moments 13, 14, and 15 that Brian is going to ts up for and each Councilmember can discuss their amendment and then we will go back and have them moved on to the calendar to vote.",345,,
1189,0.97,7944.336,7956.682,This is the final slide of amendment and it is the second set of amendments that conflict with each other or are mutually exclusive.,346,,
1190,0.97,7956.682,7959.017,"Amendments 13, 14 and 15 all relate to admissions pricing and public benefits.",346,,
1191,0.97,7959.017,7974.366,I want to note that for amendment 13 I will describe version 5 so that is indicated on the slide in red and that has been updated since the version that was distributed in the memo yesterday.,346,,
1192,0.97,7974.366,7979.037,Also even though these are conflicting amendments the public benefit portion of the amendments is identical so I will cover that part first.,346,,
1193,0.97,7979.037,7995.187,All three of the amendments at three new components to the public access category of the annual public benefits table contained in Appendix A. they would at family discount days which are 50% off admission prices on select days.,346,,
1194,0.97,7995.187,8002.361,Participation in the Seattle public libraries museum pass program and the commitment to the programs that provide free and discount punishments.,346,,
1195,0.97,8002.361,8007.733,"The estimated value of these additional services in 2022 is $745,000.",346,,
1196,0.97,8007.733,8011.303,That part of the amendment is identical.,346,,
1197,0.97,8011.303,8020.679,All three of the amendments also provide additional control over the society's ability to set admissions prices that they do this in slightly different ways so I will walk through them one by one.,346,,
1198,0.97,8020.679,8033.525,Amendment 13 version 5 which is authored by Councilmember Strauss would require the superintendents annual approval for any increases in the societies general admissions pricing structural.,346,,
1199,0.97,8033.525,8050.842,Amendment 14 which is sponsored by Councilmember Sawant States that admission prices should not increase by more than the increase in the consumer price index which I will refer to as the CPI and increases above the CPI increase would require prior city council approval.,346,,
1200,0.97,8050.842,8066.291,Amendment 15 which is sponsored by Councilmember Herbold contains the same language as amendment 14 Referencing the CPI but rather than requiring city council approval it would require superintendent approval.,346,,
1201,0.97,8066.291,8079.771,"Amendment 13 is superintendent approval for all increases, amendment 14 requires city council approval for increases above the CPI and amendment 15 requires superintendents Improvable above the CPI.",346,,
1202,0.97,8079.771,8083.675,Thank you.,347,,
1203,0.97,8083.675,8091.416,As Councilmember Strauss is an invited guest and a nonvoting member I will move this for him.,347,,
1204,0.97,8091.416,8108.567,I moved to amend Council bill 120164 by substituting amendment 13 version 5.,347,,
1205,0.97,8110.435,8110.802,Second.,348,,
1206,0.97,8110.802,8113.004,Council member Strauss do you want to speak to this?,349,,
1207,0.97,8113.004,8116.308,Thank you chair Juarez.,350,,
1208,0.97,8116.308,8118.977,I will just check with Mr.,350,,
1209,0.97,8118.977,8119.277,Goodnight.,350,,
1210,0.97,8119.277,8120.612,You already presented about all of them.,350,,
1211,0.97,8120.612,8122.214,I will move ahead.,350,,
1212,0.97,8122.214,8125.117,Lots going on here.,350,,
1213,0.97,8125.117,8141.7,"I just want to thank both Councilmember Sawant and Herbold for their amendments including language that I worked out with the zoo and the parks Department about family discount days, about the public library and museum.",350,,
1214,0.97,8141.7,8151.91,And thank you to the zoo for being willing to engage with the King county library for your past as well.,350,,
1215,0.97,8151.91,8159.251,And then requiring the promotion of the free and discount admission programs.,350,,
1216,0.97,8159.251,8167.259,Those are public benefits that will have a really great benefit for many in our community.,350,,
1217,0.97,8167.259,8181.74,My amendment as compared to our colleagues requires an annual approval by the superintendent for any increases in daily general admission pricing structures.,350,,
1218,0.97,8181.74,8211.57,It also sets the timetable for the zoo to be able to create their pricing at the beginning of December and for the superintendent to improve that in late December so there is a full year where that plan is put in place and the zoo is able to create admission pricing that works for both clients and the zoo and has the oversight of the superintendent and the parks Department.,350,,
1219,0.97,8211.57,8223.215,"It is simple, straightforward and creates accountability and ensures that the zoo is able to operate in that fashion.",350,,
1220,0.97,8223.215,8224.416,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,351,,
1221,0.97,8224.416,8228.32,We have amendment 14 and that is Councilmember Sawant.,351,,
1222,0.97,8228.32,8231.59,Please share some background on your amendment 14.,351,,
1223,0.97,8231.59,8236.094,Thank you.,352,,
1224,0.97,8236.094,8243.568,This amendment requires city council approval for the zoo to get prices increased beyond regular inflation.,352,,
1225,0.97,8243.568,8257.582,The city is committing to provide millions of dollars in support for the zoo each year for the next decade or two and those public funds should be used to make tickets affordable.,352,,
1226,0.97,8257.582,8268.86,"If the zoo intends to increase prices faster than the inflation rate, and that effectively means pricing ordinary people out.",352,,
1227,0.97,8268.86,8286.911,And that is families with children that would be wanting to access the zoo for their families and at the very least that should require the approval of democratically elected officials.,352,,
1228,0.97,8286.911,8289.547,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,353,,
1229,0.97,8289.547,8293.985,Councilmember Herbold you are the proponent of amendment 15.,353,,
1230,0.97,8293.985,8296.488,Do you want to go ahead and share the background on that?,353,,
1231,0.97,8296.488,8298.356,Thank you so much.,354,,
1232,0.97,8298.356,8324.482,"As it relates specifically to current versions of these amendments, I just want to flag that my amendment, if taken at face value it provides additional flexibility with the zoo because my amendment would only require superintendent Improvable over 100% CPI.",354,,
1233,0.97,8324.482,8345.937,Councilmember Strauss is amendment whereas very helpful constrains the zoo to a greater sense in that any increases must receive approval from the superintendent.,354,,
1234,0.97,8345.937,8381.873,"So, my question is I understand that the zoo is having a preference for Councilmember Strauss is version of the amendment and my amendment gives the zoo the flexibility to increase prices annually without any necessary superintendent approval up to 100% CPI.",354,,
1235,0.97,8381.873,8393.084,I would be interested in hearing directly from the zoo so I could understand a little bit more about why the zoo was not interested in that flexibility.,354,,
1236,0.97,8393.084,8394.152,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,355,,
1237,0.97,8394.152,8398.656,I'm glad you brought that up because I was going to ask what the zoo's position was.,355,,
1238,0.97,8398.656,8407.499,But I wanted to know why they were in favor of amendments 14 and 15.,355,,
1239,0.97,8407.499,8412.27,Thank you for the chance to address this.,356,,
1240,0.97,8412.27,8422.113,The main issue here is the ability of the zoo to manage ts currents revenue to cover the additional cost of running the zoo.,356,,
1241,0.97,8422.113,8430.488,Just to put it in perspective the cities support provides about 18% for every dollar of operations that the zoo provides.,356,,
1242,0.97,8430.488,8441.9,In that regard it is imperative for us that we have an earned business revenue that supports our commitment to the city in a way that we run our business.,356,,
1243,0.97,8441.9,8450.141,In that regard we traditionally send our prices to the superintendent for approval.,356,,
1244,0.97,8450.141,8462.787,It has been the same thing for the last 20 years and we continue to provide that as our annual plan to the superintendent.,356,,
1245,0.97,8462.787,8474.999,"One of the reasons to cover the concerns of Councilmember Herbold and Strauss on Affordability for middle income families, we provided additional public benefits that are added in all three amendments.",356,,
1246,0.97,8474.999,8480.505,We are very proud of adding that.,356,,
1247,0.97,8480.505,8495.787,In a sense all we are asking here is for the flexibility to maintain a pricing structure that allows us to run the business in the most efficient operation but also make a significant commitment to make sure that we don't ruin our business.,356,,
1248,0.97,8495.787,8503.094,"Just as I said in my opening remarks, 40% of our clients are from middle income households.",356,,
1249,0.97,8503.094,8516.708,It would be business suicide for us to actually raise our prices to a way that people cannot afford coming to the zoo and it will make a very significant decline in our earned revenue.,356,,
1250,0.97,8516.708,8527.318,"So in that regard, amendment 13 different and perhaps amendment 15 is that it doesn't put a CPI ceiling above the approval.",356,,
1251,0.97,8527.318,8534.325,It just basically says we are going to maintain flexibility.,356,,
1252,0.97,8534.325,8543.468,Amendment 15 is basically putting the CPI requirement in that which is the ceiling for additional approval.,356,,
1253,0.97,8543.468,8566.057,"In that regard, our preferred amendment is amendment 13 because it allows the zoo to maintain running fruitful business operation with our revenue and provide us with the flexibility to have dynamic conditions of winter versus summer, weekdays and weekends.",356,,
1254,0.97,8566.057,8577.402,Guest admissions and park capacity and all of the things that happen in a very seasonally heavily attended operation.,356,,
1255,0.97,8577.402,8594.953,That is why we support the library passes and family days and the accessibility free tickets admission tickets and reduce cost because we believe in Affordability to the zoo is essential.,356,,
1256,0.97,8594.953,8610.501,But at the same time what I am asking is allowing the zoo to run an efficient business that allows us to cover $.80 out of every dollar of operations that the zoo provides.,356,,
1257,0.97,8610.501,8610.802,Thank you.,356,,
1258,0.97,8610.802,8614.205,Is there any other questions or concerns?,357,,
1259,0.97,8614.205,8619.51,What we are going to do is we will go back to amendment 13,357,,
1260,0.97,8619.51,8623.381,"Go-Ahead Councilmember Herbold, I didn't see you.",358,,
1261,0.97,8623.381,8632.357,I just want to close up by saying I am going to withdraw amendment 15.,359,,
1262,0.97,8632.357,8662.654,"I do want to state for the record I did not understand the answer for why the zoo would want to have to get approval from the superintendent for a dime increase in its admissions for instance, for example amendment three you have to get the approval annually for any size increase.",359,,
1263,0.97,8662.654,8668.393,Mine only addresses large increases.,359,,
1264,0.97,8668.393,8696.12,"So, it has not been explained to me in a way that I can understand why you would want that more onerous requirement but I do want to just state for the record I withdraw the amendment and I am concerned is that what I am hearing is you don't want any reference to CPI in the agreement it all and that really makes me very nervous.",359,,
1265,0.97,8696.12,8720.711,I know that there is interest in increasing ticket prices to be at the level of other comparable facilities so the concern I have is the inclusion of the 100% CPI would give you more flexibility.,359,,
1266,0.97,8720.711,8732.323,My concern is the fact that you don't want it mentioned in there at all might be Foreshadowing of where we may see these ticket prices go in the future.,359,,
1267,0.97,8732.323,8739.397,Although I understand that the ability of middle-class families to afford tickets is your bread and butter.,359,,
1268,0.97,8739.397,8763.554,I am hearing that loud and clear but I am anticipating that we will see some increases that might make the range of Affordability more like the Aquarium at 71- $99 for a family of four where as the zoo is an affordable $57 for a family of four.,359,,
1269,0.97,8763.554,8768.126,Thank you.,359,,
1270,0.97,8768.126,8772.63,"Dr. Grajal, do you want to respond to that?",360,,
1271,0.97,8772.63,8782.173,I think I heard your answer differently then doctor Herbold heard.,360,,
1272,0.97,8782.173,8790.047,The CPI would hamper some of the flexibility needed and he rattled off a bunch of reasons why.,360,,
1273,0.97,8790.047,8791.582,It is just more Nuanced than that.,360,,
1274,0.97,8791.582,8798.089,You are not just tying it to market conditions which is CPI.,360,,
1275,0.97,8798.089,8799.357,It is a bit more Nuanced.,360,,
1276,0.97,8799.357,8804.395,Is there anything you want to respond to that so we can share that with the rest of our colleagues and move on from this?,360,,
1277,0.97,8804.395,8817.508,"Unlike the Aquarium or perhaps other downtown facilities as I said, it comes from neighbors and residents of the city.",361,,
1278,0.97,8817.508,8821.612,We cannot have tourist prices here because these are prices that are paid by neighbors and families here in Seattle.,361,,
1279,0.97,8821.612,8822.814,"So, that is important for us.",361,,
1280,0.97,8822.814,8831.823,And it would be business suicide for us to out price ourselves from our main client which is the middle income families in the region.,361,,

1329,0.97,9060.418,9098.489,"While she withdrew amendment 15 I think the concerns that she brings her a good one, especially as we want to be good stewards of making sure that the public asset of the zoo is accessible and the CPI issue does raise some questions and I understand the answer that was given twice about wanting to be accessible and affordable as well but perhaps we can do additional work with you all to continue to keep an eye on what considerations are going into that price increase that has been afforded for the zoo and amendment 13 version 5.",372,,

1371,0.97,9301.258,9312.302,We appreciate the ability to come in and talk about our state recreation conservation office applications.,388,,
1372,0.97,9312.302,9326.15,"As you mentioned Council member Juarez at the beginning of this overall session, this is something we do every year but we seek authority from you all to complete our application.",388,,
1373,0.97,9326.15,9338.729,I will go through this very quickly.,388,,
1374,0.97,9338.729,9358.182,"Our Ceo is the recreation conservation office is a Washington state group and it is an agency that amendment several grants and they provide these grants to support recreational opportunities including to support wildlife habitat, farmland and restoration.",389,,
1375,0.97,9358.182,9368.692,The Rcl runs a process every other year and all this is dependent on how much funding is allocated.,389,,
1376,0.97,9368.692,9375.265,We are here to talk specifically about the component called the legacy grant program which is implemented in partnership with the National Park service.,389,,
1377,0.97,9375.265,9388.579,As part of this grant we are eligible to apply in these fund capital projects in low income urban areas with limited access to parks and recreation resources.,389,,
1378,0.97,9388.579,9391.949,These are grants that compete at the state and national level.,389,,
1379,0.97,9391.949,9405.262,The key here is that it requires a One-To-One match from the local Grantee and thus I need to come to you all for that authority.,389,,
1380,0.97,9405.262,9429.586,"The other piece here which is also important is these grants create a long-term commitment if we receive grant funding from this source, than those properties that are supported Y this funding source have to be maintained and operated for the purposes for which the funding was received in Perpetuity.",389,,
1381,0.97,9429.586,9438.495,"As an example, if we use this money to build a new playground, we couldn't turn around and turn that into a parking lot.",389,,
1382,0.97,9438.495,9445.402,"That is an extreme example, but it does create restrictions that are permanent here and we want to make sure we are clear about that.",389,,
1383,0.97,9445.402,9453.944,Next slide please.,389,,
1384,0.97,9453.944,9471.762,This year we submitted to grant request for this cycle and these projects are going to be eligible for this funding in March 2012 2022.,390,,
1385,0.97,9471.762,9486.31,The city has to provide matching funds and has to be able to continue to operate those projects in line with the grant that was approved.,390,,
1386,0.97,9486.31,9510.501,"So, part of our work in selecting these projects, we look at all of our project menu and then really look at the criteria that is laid out by the legacy plan which really looks at specifics that they are serving areas that have limited access to parks and recreation services.",390,,
1387,0.97,9510.501,9516.073,"For us, we look at specific organizations as well.",390,,
1388,0.97,9516.073,9520.11,Next slide please.,390,,
1389,0.97,9520.11,9526.516,Here is how the process works.,391,,
1390,0.97,9526.516,9530.721,Excuse me.,391,,
1391,0.97,9530.721,9540.33,We appreciate the opportunity to apply for these grants and it allows us to leverage existing dollars that are allocated to grants and simply double the availability of funding.,391,,
1392,0.97,9540.33,9549.406,These are competitive public and state and national applicants engaged in this process.,391,,
1393,0.97,9549.406,9561.485,"And as we apply, as you see on the slide the grant applications were due in July 2021.",391,,
1394,0.97,9561.485,9564.154,They will not be reviewed or recommended for funding until October of next year.,391,,
1395,0.97,9564.154,9573.163,Since the applications were due in July we do have the opportunity from the Rcl office to submit to them a resolution that gives us the authority given the specific commitments.,391,,
1396,0.97,9573.163,9587.377,I think it is important to note as well as I said these are really powerful opportunities to leverage additional resources to support programs.,391,,
1397,0.97,9587.377,9596.687,This year we selected two projects.,391,,
1398,0.97,9596.687,9601.325,I think Council members may already know where these are but we have a map in your packet.,391,,
1399,0.97,9601.325,9608.765,We have highlighted the phase 2 restoration which is aimed at enhancing a half-acre waterfront park.,391,,
1400,0.97,9608.765,9613.837,"Looking at fitness zones, a walking Loop, Pathway next to the equipment.",391,,
1401,0.97,9613.837,9620.611,"Some additional servicing and landscaping and other amenities such as picnic tables, queues and some bike racks.",391,,
1402,0.97,9620.611,9643.5,This grant in particular also includes in water restoration elements such as park vegetation and logs to control sediment for the habitat . The second project is the Garfield Superblock grant which is the block surrounding the Garfield community center just north of the high school there.,391,,
1403,0.97,9643.5,9656.413,"This is a full renovation project that includes all sorts of new furnishings, improving the access play equipment, nature play, some modifications to a Restroom facility and covered picnic areas.",391,,
1404,0.97,9656.413,9657.247,A pretty robust project.,391,,
1405,0.97,9657.247,9669.159,"Both of these projects have pretty robust community engagement, community support and a lot of work that was done by our community partners.",391,,
1406,0.97,9669.159,9673.664,We are excited to submit these as part of our application.,391,,
1407,0.97,9673.664,9678.568,The next light gives you a little more detail just for the scale and scope of these projects.,391,,
1408,0.97,9678.568,9683.273,This is in Southeast Seattle from Rainier Beach high school.,391,,
1409,0.97,9683.273,9714.071,We are seeking a match of an allocation bringing that to just under 1 million and then the Garfield Superblock grant request there is to leverage the roughly $2 million that we have allocated and bring in an additional $2 million which would give us a total of 4.17 million dollars.,391,,
1410,0.97,9714.071,9718.809,The total grant request is five point $1 million.,391,,
1411,0.97,9718.809,9721.111,That is all we have unless you have any questions.,391,,
1412,0.97,9721.111,9723.513,"Or Robert, if there is anything else you would like to add?",391,,
1413,0.97,9723.513,9734.357,I should say that truly the person behind all of this has been Robert Warner who was on the phone on the call right now and has been Stewarding this grant process very successfully.,391,,
1414,0.97,9734.357,9739.129,"So, thank you Robert.",391,,
1415,0.97,9739.129,9742.432,"Robert, did you want to share anything before we close this out?",392,,
1416,0.97,9742.432,9743.9,I don't have anything else to share.,393,,
1417,0.97,9743.9,9747.938,I think that Jesus was very thorough and really summarizes these two particular grants.,393,,

1444,0.97,9860.517,9864.754,Can we have our Presenters introduce themselves?,404,,
1445,0.97,9864.754,9874.231,"Good afternoon, Lish Whitson, counsel central staff.",405,,
1446,0.97,9874.231,9880.57,Francesca Murman Department of neighborhoods.,406,,
1447,0.97,9880.57,9887.544,"I'm really happy to see Lish Whitson, and Francesca welcome.",407,,
1448,0.97,9887.544,9889.479,She is the person we hired from the Department.,407,,
1449,0.97,9889.479,9905.061,She is our very first native American who will staff this phenomenal counsel and Francesca did phenomenal work on the board.,407,,
1450,0.97,9905.061,9907.564,I think I saw her a couple of times in DC lobbying.,407,,
1451,0.97,9907.564,9908.131,Thank you Francesca.,407,,
1452,0.97,9908.131,9911.635,I'm going to hand it over to you guys and then we can say of words.,407,,
1453,0.97,9911.635,9917.974,Are you going to start us off list?,407,,
1454,0.97,9917.974,9920.01,Thank you Councilmember.,408,,
1455,0.97,9920.01,9947.103,"You had proposed this idea a few years ago and proposed this as the first move for the Seattle city Council to increase access, increase accountability and increase communication between our tribes, our urban Indian organizations and local Seattle indigenous communities.",408,,
1456,0.97,9947.103,9963.553,And the first effort that was sponsored by you and supported by the rest of city Council was to create a position under the Department of neighborhoods that would staff the work of the indigenous advisory Council.,408,,
1457,0.97,9963.553,9976.266,"In the last two years what we have done our two parallel efforts which is one to create the staffing position which from the help of the Seattle city Council, that was funded last year.",408,,
1458,0.97,9976.266,10002.692,"For the last several months your office and Lish Whitson and staff from the Department of neighborhoods have worked together to create that this staffing position would be adequately Resourced and equipped to support a future indigenous advisory Council and that was recently filled which is now Francesca, the indigenous advisory Council that is one side of it.",408,,
1459,0.97,10002.692,10011.901,The second side is this bill that we have before us which is finally here to actually establish this in Seattle municipal code.,408,,
1460,0.97,10011.901,10054.01,"And just to quickly highlight the process that your office has done for the rest of your colleagues, I will mention that we have reached out to tribes in the area and we have worked with different community organizations and during this global pandemic, it has been hard I think for folks to create 100% time and attention on one piece of legislation, it is an ongoing work product and it has evolved I think to create a great foundation to potentially expand or adjust as we move forward and continue to build partnerships.",408,,
1461,0.97,10054.01,10061.251,I say that because not every entity that we reached out to was able to have the time to respond.,408,,
1462,0.97,10061.251,10070.393,"So, it is important that I highlight that partnerships are ongoing and trust building takes time.",408,,
1463,0.97,10070.393,10073.63,And we want to maintain that authenticity.,408,,
1464,0.97,10073.63,10082.939,What I will do is go ahead and give it to Lish Whitson to go through his memo and I am here to answer any other questions.,408,,
1465,0.97,10082.939,10083.239,Thank you.,408,,
1466,0.97,10083.239,10087.043,Lish?,408,,
1467,0.97,10087.043,10098.855,I just want to say that a lot of the work for this legislation was done by Negheen Kamkar and Councilmember Lara's office and I just helped to finalize it.,409,,
1468,0.97,10098.855,10111.134,They have done a lot of great work thinking through a lot of issues related to indigenous advisory Council and how that is a unique body advising the city.,409,,
1469,0.97,10111.134,10130.019,"So, the legislation in front of you would set up an indigenous advisory Council to improve communications between tribes between urban Indians and other indigenous people including native Hawaiians, and Alaska natives in the city of Seattle.",409,,
1470,0.97,10130.019,10144.934,We are developing consultation with native communities and it highlights both the unique challenges that face indigenous people and their resilience in the face of historic and current challenges.,409,,
1471,0.97,10144.934,10155.512,The goal of the Council is to increase an understanding of the needs of indigenous people and improve how the city delivers services to indigenous people.,409,,
1472,0.97,10155.512,10172.862,"There are six sections establishing the Council describing its membership, outlining terms of service, providing for compensation of members, outlining the duties of the Council and recognizing indigenous communities rights to their cultural property.",409,,
1473,0.97,10172.862,10194.417,"Some of the unique duties of the Council will be to advise on a tribal consultation policy to improve communication with tribal governments, to develop policies on communicating with urban Indian organizations and advise on ways to improve services for indigenous communities and particularly Seattle's urban Indian population.",409,,
1474,0.97,10194.417,10203.259,"The Council will have nine members, three recommended by tribes and granted by the Council and Mayor.",409,,
1475,0.97,10203.259,10206.329,Four recommended by urban Indian organizations and appointed by the Council and Mayor.,409,,
1476,0.97,10206.329,10220.61,"One other appointed by the Mayor, one youth member appointed by the Council and all of the members would be subject to final approval by the Council.",409,,
1477,0.97,10220.61,10234.224,Each member would have a Two- year term except for during the first year when we are trying to create staggered terms for membership and they would be appointed for up to four consecutive terms.,409,,
1478,0.97,10234.224,10241.03,And they will provide the opportunity for Department neighborhoods to compensate members for their time and expenses.,409,,
1479,0.97,10241.03,10253.743,I wanted to highlight the unique aspects of this counsel which is a recognition of indigenous communities cultural property.,409,,
1480,0.97,10253.743,10263.052,"Their unique knowledge, history, symbols and stories that belong to indigenous communities and we anticipate drawing on this through the indigenous advisory Council.",409,,
1481,0.97,10263.052,10274.03,The bill provides for the Council to develop a rule respecting how members can share that cultural property with the city while still holding the property in their community.,409,,
1482,0.97,10274.03,10286.075,And this mentioned a permanent position to staff the Council and continues to be ongoing.,409,,
1483,0.97,10286.075,10295.151,"And Francesca who was hired for that position, I think is going to talk a little bit about how she envisions recruiting for the Council.",409,,
1484,0.97,10295.151,10299.989,Thank you.,410,,
1485,0.97,10299.989,10300.39,Francesca?,410,,

1489,0.97,10314.103,10323.913,I am excited to support our thriving indigenous communities in Seattle and I think this is an historic effort to offer trust to native committees.,411,,
1490,0.97,10323.913,10327.417,And advancing racial equity for all indigenous people.,411,,
1491,0.97,10327.417,10337.76,With the upcoming passage of the ordinance we will be doing outreach and recruitment for the Inaugural nine members of the Council to be selected in early 2022.,411,,

1493,0.97,10345.034,10362.251,"Interested applicants will be able to subscribe to Email updates using the advisory Council Webpage which will soon be located on the Department of neighborhoods Website and they will be able to find application materials, frequently asked questions as well as my contact information.",411,,

1495,0.97,10373.563,10376.933,The recommended appointments will be confirmed by city council in early 2022.,411,,
1496,0.97,10376.933,10393.249,Grateful for the opportunity to support your efforts here to advance these obligations and to our indigenous communities alongside the work of the tribal relations division and I think this will be a really powerful movement to support our native communities here.,411,,
1497,0.97,10393.249,10394.05,So thank you.,411,,
1498,0.97,10394.05,10398.988,Thank you Francesca.,412,,

1500,0.97,10401.591,10410.032,Is there anyone who would like to add any comments that they would like to share before I do my closing statement so to speak?,412,,
1501,0.97,10410.032,10410.6,Councilmember Herbold?,413,,
1502,0.97,10410.6,10414.27,Go ahead.,413,,
1503,0.97,10414.27,10436.492,"I just want to express my sincere appreciation for you, Councilmember Morris and Madame chair for bringing forward this legislation and for all the hard work Negheen Kamkar that you have been doing working to solicit the input of indigenous communities here locally as well as nationally.",414,,
1504,0.97,10436.492,10452.341,"And I am just really excited about this historic, groundbreaking work to recognize what has been really an unmet need with this official capacity within municipal governments.",414,,
1505,0.97,10452.341,10482.238,"I do want to confirm, as you might imagine I have been questioned for the past couple months now as interest in creating this body increases, they have been in touch with my office to ask about the Council and ask when the legislation will be coming forward and ask how they can apply to serve or nominate members to serve.",414,,
1506,0.97,10482.238,10488.544,I have shared the legislation once it was referred.,414,,
1507,0.97,10488.544,10514.27,On the agenda and I just want to confirm that a Non-Federally recognized tribe would still be able to nominate their own members as delegates for positions 1-3? I just want to ensure that the terms tribes and tribal councils are not defined or attributed in any way to exclude the participation of Non-Federally recognized tribes.,414,,
1508,0.97,10514.27,10514.504,Thanks.,414,,
1509,0.97,10514.504,10521.978,Is there anyone else that has anything they want to share?,415,,
1510,0.97,10521.978,10528.918,I was looking for confirmation of the accuracy of my statement.,416,,
1511,0.97,10528.918,10542.565,The confirmation I can give you is that this committee will not be excluding and that is why we are putting together an indigenous advisory Council to get it up and running and let this group with Self- determination make those decisions.,417,,
1512,0.97,10542.565,10545.134,This isn't about who is a recognized tribe and who is not.,417,,
1513,0.97,10545.134,10553.91,"We are well aware of the issues going on for five of the Non- recognized, there were three that became recognized.",417,,
1514,0.97,10553.976,10560.216,Understand this issue but I also don't want to get in the middle of it.,417,,
1515,0.97,10560.216,10569.825,"That is why we created this so we would have an indigenous advisory Council that is inclusive that will look at these issues in an organic matter, kinship manor and relative matter and advise us what we need to be doing.",417,,
1516,0.97,10569.825,10572.662,I don't want to confirm or deny.,417,,
1517,0.97,10572.662,10581.237,I want to say it is a big tent and that is why we hard Francesca because she understands Indian country.,417,,
1518,0.97,10581.237,10591.18,I want those people making decisions and handling that.,417,,
1519,0.97,10591.18,10604.093,The authority to select people is vested in native organizations.,418,,
1520,0.97,10604.093,10608.464,I'm only asking about the positions that are nominated by the tribes.,418,,
1521,0.97,10608.464,10616.973,I just want to know that this tribe is one of the tribes that can put forward nominations.,418,,
1522,0.97,10616.973,10618.174,That is all I'm asking.,418,,
1523,0.97,10618.174,10619.375,And I think I answered.,419,,
1524,0.97,10619.375,10622.011,So that is where we are at.,419,,
1525,0.97,10622.011,10625.915,Councilmember Mosqueda?,420,,
1526,0.97,10625.915,10627.116,Thank you very much.,421,,
1527,0.97,10627.116,10634.59,I just wanted to take a second to thank you for the work you have done here.,421,,
1528,0.97,10634.59,10639.195,"As you know, the importance of self-determination, direction and control.",421,,
1529,0.97,10639.195,10644.033,I look forward to the increased communication and the doorways that I think this will open.,421,,
1530,0.97,10644.033,10652.441,And hopefully model as well for other jurisdictions as we seek to improve government to government relations.,421,,
1531,0.97,10652.441,10657.947,"And, congratulations as well for the work that you got in the budget.",421,,
1532,0.97,10657.947,10675.264,I think the budget that this council passed included this position to staff the advisory Council and I am really glad we were able to secure that funding and ensure that the position in the budget got us to this point.,421,,
1533,0.97,10675.264,10677.466,And that we were able to hear from Francesca.,421,,
1534,0.97,10677.466,10680.803,And to be able to get an update on the board and the legislation.,421,,
1535,0.97,10680.803,10689.478,I think it is a product of that good work that you late.,421,,
1536,0.97,10689.478,10695.184,"So thanks for all of that work and again, I do hope this continues to be a model for other jurisdictions for improved government to government relations.",421,,
1537,0.97,10695.184,10697.653,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda.,422,,
1538,0.97,10697.653,10703.159,Normally don't like to talk a lot but there are a few things I just want to share.,423,,
1539,0.97,10703.159,10705.394,First of all this is a positive moment.,423,,
1540,0.97,10705.394,10712.334,"It is not a moment where I want to discuss inclusion, exclusion.",423,,
1541,0.97,10712.334,10717.873,What I want to focus on is that for the first time this city has an indigenous advisory Council similar to the city of Portland.,423,,
1542,0.97,10717.873,10726.615,One of the first cities to know how it on the legislative branch.,423,,
1543,0.97,10726.615,10727.616,The state does that.,423,,
1544,0.97,10727.616,10731.72,I think Senator John McCoy started it when I was still in the governor's office.,423,,
1545,0.97,10731.72,10734.19,We have been working on this for two years.,423,,
1546,0.97,10734.19,10740.729,Thank you Madame chair and Madame vice chair for funding this position.,423,,
1547,0.97,10740.729,10750.005,For understanding the need for it in the city that is named after the chief and bringing up why we needed this.,423,,
1548,0.97,10750.005,10761.25,"Even though I am native and I work here, a lot of the tribes still think I am their legal counsel or or the go to person and I'm not.",423,,
1549,0.97,10761.25,10770.96,I wanted to be the community and the people who get nominated to be on this counsel to make those decisions and let us know what we need to be doing.,423,,
1550,0.97,10770.96,10772.461,I'm not the Arbitrator of any of that.,423,,
1551,0.97,10772.461,10785.541,"Talking about tribal government, and supporting urban indigenous organizations and particularly tribal leadership.",423,,
1552,0.97,10785.541,10791.046,"These tribes are looking at what we are doing and talking to their city governments like Bellingham, the city of Forks and other cities because this is important.",423,,
1553,0.97,10791.046,10798.621,And we talk about Indian country but there really are no borders because this is indigenous land.,423,,
1554,0.97,10798.621,10801.09,This is not Performative legislation.,423,,
1555,0.97,10801.09,10810.733,"We are hiring native people who have subject matter expertise were familiar and Well-Versed in Indian country Sovereigty, self-determination, all of those issues.",423,,
1556,0.97,10810.733,10828.651,"I am glad that I can push this off to a group that will actually be staffed and come back to us and tell us about issues of climate change, boarding schools, Healthcare, missing women, and also talking about native American folks reclaiming indigenous language and places.",423,,
1557,0.97,10828.651,10831.487,I don't want to be the Arbitrator that.,423,,
1558,0.97,10831.487,10835.391,I don't want to decide who gets to decide what we name the creek or river or any area.,423,,
1559,0.97,10835.391,10838.694,"I want this group, to have that be their job.",423,,
1560,0.97,10838.694,10851.907,"Having a staffer like Francesca who is getting paid and their job is to sit down with the indigenous advisory Council and it may grow, but to tell us what we need to do.",423,,
1561,0.97,10851.907,10855.244,I cannot tell you how excited and how happy I am that we actually have that staff.,423,,
1562,0.97,10855.244,10856.645,I want to end on this.,423,,
1563,0.97,10856.645,10868.09,I had some wonderful discussions with tribal leadership about now coming to the table on the legislative side and having a voice in economic Deboned.,423,,
1564,0.97,10868.09,10880.536,"Not a gift shop on the waterfront, but actually having a voice in economic involvement and revenue streams, economic engines at every district in the city and that is a huge project and something that I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and get busy on.",423,,
1565,0.97,10880.536,10890.045,We used to have it joke as tribal lawyers where we would say our sovereignty is yours sovereignty.,423,,
1566,0.97,10890.045,10893.716,A lot of work to do and a lot of jobs to create an a lot of opportunity.,423,,
1567,0.97,10893.716,10900.489,But more importantly having this advisory counsel is going to actually go beyond the land acknowledgment.,423,,
1568,0.97,10900.489,10904.76,I appreciate that you all do that but the real piece of that is are you going to give it back?,423,,
1569,0.97,10904.76,10908.564,Probably not.,423,,
1570,0.97,10908.564,10925.114,"However, we can step in to work with tribal governments and indigenous urban organizations and any other group that wants to be part of this big plan to reclaim, to indigent eyes and to make sure that tribal leadership, indigenous folks are at the table making decisions about their lives.",423,,
1571,0.97,10925.114,10926.115,"So for that, I'm very proud.",423,,
1572,0.97,10926.115,10935.991,"I also want to say that we also want to work with and we have done this in the past, with organizations like the University of Washington and our colleges and the Burke museum.",423,,
1573,0.97,10935.991,10946.335,I have had some meetings with them about cultural goods and services and things we want to see from the Museum and the University of Washington.,423,,
1574,0.97,10946.335,10952.107,Working with the state committee and the national committee and national organizations.,423,,
1575,0.97,10952.107,10952.941,Francesca is familiar with these.,423,,
1576,0.97,10952.941,10960.549,She knows the National caucus of American Indians.,423,,
1577,0.97,10960.549,10966.055,"Affiliated tribes of the Northwest, managing 50 tribes in the Northwest all doing policy decisions in their cities as well.",423,,
1578,0.97,10966.055,10968.424,This isn't just on the reservation.,423,,
1579,0.97,10968.424,10974.863,It isn't just about treaties and that is why Federal Indian law and policy is way more than just a treaty.,423,,
1580,0.97,10974.863,10977.266,We are so far beyond that.,423,,
