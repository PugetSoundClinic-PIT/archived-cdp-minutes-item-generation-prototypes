64,0.97,512.545,524.59,There were two big Council funding priorities that are going to require a little bit of follow-up with the executive departments.,22,,
65,0.97,524.657,536.736,"At least two, but two that I will highlight this morning . one of which the fully funding of the 25 safe lives that the Council funded through the American recovery act.",22,,
66,0.97,536.802,555.588,And making sure that that money can be bid out to allow community members to proper strategies to provide a safe and Hygienic place for people to safely park their vehicles for folks who are living in their vehicles.,22,,

68,0.97,561.594,580.646,In the American recovery act plan that this Council past and it was signed by Mayor Durkan . I will say that there has been follow-up from Councilmember Mosqueda and I on both of these priorities to the human services Department and the city budget office.,22,,
69,0.97,580.713,593.192,"It does appear that folks are in a mood to solve for these issues, and hopefully there will be some updates by the time we can been for briefing a week from today.",22,,
70,0.97,593.259,609.208,"To share where we are on potentially solving some of the ambiguities, or misconceptions, around the Council's budget priorities, or how the Council budgeted for these particular investments.",22,,
71,0.97,609.275,622.455,"Again, I think I can safely speak for the full council that we considered both of those investments to be fully funded and things that should be implemented with the utmost urgency and speed.",22,,
72,0.97,622.521,639.171,"So, I look forward to ironing out the details and moving forward to the next step to make sure that those several hundred units of additional shelter for people experiencing homelessness can be fully realized this year as was intended by the Council.",22,,
73,0.97,639.238,641.474,And was intended by Mayor Durkan when she signed the budget.,22,,
74,0.97,641.54,651.417,"Moving on, we do have another item on this afternoon's agenda that is related to homelessness policy in the city.",22,,
75,0.97,651.484,667.033,Councilmembers will have seen last week that we received word from the city clerk that charter amendment 29 has received signatures in order to be considered for placement on the November ballot.,22,,

77,0.97,671.804,696.962,"In my capacity as the chair of the select Committee on homelessness strategies and investments, I recommend, in anticipation of considering this resolution this afternoon, that Councilmembers please review the guidance from the law Department that was distributed by Council President's office, and I will speak more to that process when it comes up on the agenda later today.",22,,
78,0.97,697.029,707.473,"So, just wanted to foreshadow that forecast a little bit here at briefing.",22,,
79,0.97,707.54,733.632,"I would like, before we move on from homelessness policy, and this is something I will have to discuss with Council President's office, but I would like to have a August select Committee on homelessness meeting before we depart for Recess to talk about--well, one to do a little bit of follow-up on some of the things hanging out there from last Wednesday that it would be nice to get on the record Clarifications from, given the urgency of some of those investments.",22,,
80,0.97,733.699,755.387,But also to have a panel on provider capacity and necessary policies to scale provider capacity given that we are going to need to create a housing and shelter system that can scale to the size of the community demand.,22,,
81,0.97,755.454,759.091,It is something that has frequently come up as a bottleneck.,22,,
82,0.97,759.158,765.464,It has been provider capacity and the ability of providers to take on the work that we urgently need to be able to do as a community.,22,,
83,0.97,765.531,792.491,"Having a hearing before Recess, and before we gear up the fall budget process I think would be helpful to scope that conversation to make sure that we are putting in the investments necessary to really meet that community demand . So, that is something I will be talking to Council President about to see if we might be able to carve out space and time to do that, given that it is already August 2ND.",22,,
84,0.97,792.558,799.899,"It's going to be a busy August, so hopefully it can be accommodated giving the importance of the issue.",22,,

91,0.97,883.616,889.188,"Over the course of the last several very difficult months . with that, Madam President, I don't have any additional updates.",22,,

106,0.97,1024.556,1033.632,"And really played an important role in sort of serving as a liaison between the funding and resources that we have at the city, and those local businesses.",24,,
107,0.97,1033.699,1061.46,"So, we wanted to celebrate them and the only in Seattle partners and community liaisons over the past year and a half reached over 2300 businesses . served over 1000 businesses in at least 10 different languages . and over 60% of those businesses that were served were owned by people of color . So, I really want to command the office of economic development.",24,,

110,0.97,1073.539,1077.643,"So, I want to thank them for that work.",24,,
111,0.97,1077.709,1090.989,"Now that the Federal Eviction moratorium has expired, I want to remind folks here in Seattle that we still have a moratorium in place until September 30th . and that there is rental assistance available.",24,,
112,0.97,1091.056,1112.578,"King County Eviction prevention and rental assistance program has $145 million in funding from the Federal Coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act .

113,0.97,1112.644,1114.079,Department page.,24,,
114,0.97,1114.146,1158.79,"Or, you can just call that team, and the number four that assistance is 206-263-3481 also, want to remind folks that there are Eviction protections in place that we passed last year . and earlier this year that set in place payment plans for up to six months following the end of the Seattle Eviction moratorium . It bans landlords from discriminating against future tenants for Eviction records that are stemming from proceedings that happened during the civil emergency . We also passed protections that provided--provide a defense to Eviction if you are financially unable to pay for rent during the civil emergency.",24,,
115,0.97,1158.857,1166.365,"So, it is scary to think what may be happening across the country now that that Federal moratorium has expired.",24,,
116,0.97,1166.431,1186.485,"But, we do have some protections in place here in Seattle, so want to remind folks of that and remind you to take advantage of both the protections and the rental assistance that is out there .

117,0.97,1186.552,1209.708,"When we have millions of people who are still Unvaccinated, including children who are under 12, and Immunocompromise D people who are still at risk, and when the Delta variant is increasing the risk for each of us to contract Covid, it only makes sense that each of our community members, including our business neighbors, take every measure possible to protect workers.",24,,
118,0.97,1209.775,1214.446,"To protect children, and just to protect every other neighborhood lapses every other neighbor in our city.",24,,
119,0.97,1214.513,1231.196,"I just want to thank those 60 or so establishments who are leading on this effort, and hope to see more of that as we tried to mitigate and stem the increase in exposure that we are all experiencing because of the Delta variant.",24,,

130,0.97,1308.04,1309.641,It feels like that was the right decision.,26,,
131,0.97,1309.708,1319.351,"So, thank you very much for your Proactive work on that . The second thing, I wanted to thank Councilmember Morales the ways in which our city Eviction moratorium policies are different from the Federal Government and the state government.",26,,
132,0.97,1319.418,1328.894,"We have ongoing city level funds, and an ongoing moratorium on Evictions as was noted through the end of September.",26,,
133,0.97,1328.96,1348.914,"Want to make sure that folks note that this is not only an extension of the Eviction moratorium, but a continuation of rental assistance dollars as well, which we will continue to expand upon in our meeting tomorrow in the Finance and housing committee meeting . please note that if you're hearing this is a small landlord, those rental assistance dollars go directly to you as landlords.",26,,
134,0.97,1348.98,1356.088,W want to make sure that people have financial stabilities both as Renters and small landlords.,26,,

261,0.97,3199.896,3219.883,"Something that I just share with you is that Ballard Avenue is a unique street in that it is cut off at 15th Avenue Northwest, and cut off at market Street Northwest, so the thoroughfare is pretty limited . It's also in a historic district so the pedestrian is Asian of that space is pretty easy.",33,,
262,0.97,3219.95,3250.013,"The University way Avenue is giving us a run for the money because it is a thoroughfare .

269,0.97,3315.211,3325.922,"Sdot agree that early designs show we have enough street with to accommodate both the two way walking and bike path, and the two way traffic at reduced speed.",33,,
270,0.97,3325.989,3343.039,"That's an important part about reduced speed so we can make that a more human scale space . Lastly, I just want to say that Sdot did also over the weekend celebrate the completion of the green Lake haven project, which was the other half of green Lake.",33,,
271,0.97,3343.106,3347.21,"I had hoped to attend this event, unfortunately was unable to.",33,,
