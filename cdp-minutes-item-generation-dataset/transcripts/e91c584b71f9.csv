95,0.97,651.617,667.133,The proposed legislation would greatly amount the limit of the ability of the city to engage or work with Encampments even if it poses public health issues in the downtown square in Seattle.,30,,
96,0.97,667.133,675.274,"We recently received several Encampments in the safety and threshold for our community, especially the people experiencing homelessness.",30,,
97,0.97,675.274,694.727,Currently Encampments can only be removed in the most extreme public safety and health circumstances with the individuals offering shelter.,30,,
98,0.97,694.727,703.202,We are asking that the Council keep the public health safety.,30,,

105,0.97,735.568,742.775,Washington State-Wide has seen decrease in shelter capacity by roughly 30% since Covid-19 started.,32,,
106,0.97,742.775,747.413,So we have quite tangibly lost ground in the homelessness response in the last two months.,32,,

116,0.97,791.19,798.764,I think they are unethical under any circumstance and especially bad during a pandemic.,34,,
117,0.97,798.764,802.168,To use public health for the sweep is wrong.,34,,
118,0.97,802.168,807.807,Raise taxes to fund enough housing for everyone that needs it because housing is a human right.,34,,

859,0.97,5885.613,5887.281,I live just north of Pioneer square.,217,,
860,0.97,5887.281,5892.753,I am calling to oppose CB 119796.,217,,
861,0.97,5892.753,5896.59,There is an encampment outside my building that is growing by the day.,217,,
862,0.97,5896.59,5903.197,I can only imagine how bad this will get if left alone until 2021.,217,,
863,0.97,5903.197,5916.076,My wife does not feel safe leaving the building alone and the landlord closed one of our exit due to the inability or the unwillingness to clean up the human Excrement.,217,,
864,0.97,5916.076,5919.013,I predict the fairy Walkway will become virtually impassable.,217,,
865,0.97,5919.013,5929.256,How are people supposed to maintain six foot distance when only four feet of sidewalk is included in the bill.,217,,
866,0.97,5929.256,5932.159,There is nothing safe about these Encampments.,217,,
867,0.97,5932.159,5935.162,Please allow the navigation team to continue to do their job.,217,,
868,0.97,5935.162,5935.963,Thank you.,218,,
869,0.97,5935.963,5939.867,That is our last Commentor.,218,,
870,0.97,5939.867,5944.271,There are no more present people who have signed up to comment.,218,,
871,0.97,5944.271,5952.246,I will now end public comment and we will move on to the next agenda item.,218,,
872,0.97,5952.246,5961.188,With that I will begin the discussion of counsel bill 119796.,218,,
873,0.97,5961.188,5975.803,I just want to read a couple of remarks at the beginning and then handed over first two Councilmember Morales to speak to this bill.,218,,
874,0.97,5975.803,5977.604,I want to give an overview of the conversation.,218,,
875,0.97,5977.604,5992.886,A number of Stakeholders are here and will be discussing counsel bill 119796 relating to the circumstances under which the navigation team can engage in the removal of Encampments during Covid-19 pandemic.,218,,
876,0.97,5992.886,5995.723,We will hear from two panels.,218,,
877,0.97,5995.723,6007.701,"The first will be composed of Jessica Quan, executive director Allison I Greg from the Seattle coalition of homelessness.",218,,
878,0.97,6007.701,6017.277,"Taryn Moss, Elizabeth Agee from international Trinity health services and Esther Lucero from the Seattle Indian health board and executive director Lisa Howard.",218,,
879,0.97,6017.277,6024.952,Our second panel is going to be composed of deputy Mayor Michael Phon and Casey six killer.,218,,
880,0.97,6024.952,6034.728,Chief of police carbon best and Seattle fire chief Scoggins as well as director of public health Patty Hayes.,218,,
881,0.97,6034.728,6056.45,"I want to preface the conversation by acknowledging at the beginning of our deliberations as a counsel, that the members of the panels and the members of the Council are going to have some divergent views on the issues we are discussing about this legislation and issues surrounding this and the navigation team.",218,,
882,0.97,6056.45,6062.956,Our discussion will touch on topics that are sensitive and have real implications.,218,,
883,0.97,6062.956,6068.762,I want all of our Presenters today to honestly convey their position on this proposed legislation.,218,,
884,0.97,6068.762,6072.9,"I want them to bring their expertise, life experience and background on how they form these decisions.",218,,
885,0.97,6072.9,6079.94,I ask that every member of the Council and all of our guest engage in conversation respectfully.,218,,
886,0.97,6079.94,6115.943,I asked that all of the panels today at the end of the discussion acknowledge that we have a commitment to public service and before engaging in a difficult conversation we stipulate at the top that the shared common commitments can help us move forward to make progress on the issues that we all see every day and the impacts that Covid has had on the most vulnerable people in our community who are expensing homelessness and who the city of Seattle is one of the most generous providers for in the region and we can always do more to expand on that work.,218,,
887,0.97,6115.943,6122.85,We are beginning from a point where all of us want to make progress.,218,,
888,0.97,6122.85,6137.731,"With that and laying the initial ground rules, I do want to give Councilmember Moralez an opportunity to speak to her legislation in advance of the first panel.",218,,
889,0.97,6137.731,6140.634,Then I will introduce the first panel and we will take that discussion away.,218,,
890,0.97,6140.634,6145.372,"Councilmember Morales, the floor is yours.",218,,
891,0.97,6145.372,6151.078,Thank you.,219,,
892,0.97,6151.078,6151.512,I appreciate it.,219,,
893,0.97,6151.512,6158.685,I want to start today by reminding everyone here and everyone who called in and everyone who is listening that we are talking about human lives when we talk about the homelessness crisis.,219,,
894,0.97,6158.685,6171.765,"We are not talking about data points or Widgets, these are people, these are people's children and chances are you know someone who has experienced or will experience homelessness.",219,,
895,0.97,6171.765,6173.867,I want you to keep that in mind as we move forward.,219,,
896,0.97,6173.867,6178.305,We are here to answer critical Russian about city policy.,219,,
897,0.97,6178.305,6184.044,What is the appropriate public health response to homelessness given the risk of community spread of the Coronavirus?,219,,
898,0.97,6184.044,6202.296,Cdc guidance on homelessness from a memo dated May 10 States that housing options that have individual rooms such as hotels and motels and separate bathrooms should be considered for overflow quarantine or protected housing sites.,219,,
899,0.97,6202.296,6207.634,"If individual options are not available, allow people who are living at the shelter or Encampments to remain where they are.",219,,
900,0.97,6207.634,6213.574,Encampments can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers.,219,,
901,0.97,6213.574,6215.108,This increases the potential for infectious disease spread.,219,,
902,0.97,6215.108,6223.216,It is clear that we are not clearly out of the woods when it comes to the Coronavirus.,219,,
903,0.97,6223.216,6233.36,We are not meeting our target for decreasing the number of cases or for reducing community spread in King County and that is as of today's update from the public health Department.,219,,
904,0.97,6233.36,6242.035,Our City Charter provides that we are here to perfect protect the health and safety of every person in the city.,219,,
905,0.97,6242.035,6254.348,"We all swore, Council members, to uphold that commitment, not for some people or just for those who agree with us, or for those who have the time and resources to call in and make their voices heard.",219,,
906,0.97,6254.348,6263.223,"Our obligation is to protect the health of everyone in Seattle including, and especially for those who are living in desperate situations.",219,,
907,0.97,6263.223,6271.365,I want to acknowledge that community members across the city are frustrated by our homelessness crisis and have been for some time.,219,,
908,0.97,6271.365,6274.234,My office had a half dozen community meetings in the Chinatown International district last week.,219,,
909,0.97,6274.234,6277.371,I know there is deep frustration.,219,,
910,0.97,6277.371,6284.745,"There is also, as many have said, and eagerness to see real solutions for our homeless neighbors.",219,,
911,0.97,6284.745,6291.885,"I understand that there are some Encampments where there is drug use, litter and violence.",219,,
912,0.97,6291.885,6296.356,I understand that there will be times where people need to be moved.,219,,
913,0.97,6296.356,6302.296,I reject the premise that the presence of some criminal activity means the entire homeless population is criminal.,219,,
914,0.97,6302.296,6309.536,I want to remind the broader Seattle community that encampment Removals do not necessarily mean that people are being housed or sheltered.,219,,
915,0.97,6309.536,6315.842,Very often it means people are being pushed from one place to another.,219,,
916,0.97,6315.842,6320.314,"We are all frustrated by the response to homelessness, especially during this pandemic.",219,,
917,0.97,6320.314,6327.154,"We are failing and we think removing people, vulnerable people over and over again will solve the issue.",219,,
918,0.97,6327.154,6335.062,"As a local government we have a responsibility to solve the housing and public health problem, not move it from one neighborhood to another.",219,,
919,0.97,6335.062,6357.484,"When a deadly infectious disease is spreading in our town, moving people just means they moved to magnolia or Chinatown International district and that puts another neighborhood at risk for exposure to Coronavirus without solving a problem that fellow human beings are living on the street without the support that they need.",219,,
920,0.97,6357.484,6363.557,It is time for us to stop treating homelessness like a crime problem and start treating it like the public health crisis that it is.,219,,
921,0.97,6363.557,6378.538,"That means we need more sanitation and hygiene services, case management for those with behavioral needs and in the short term we need individual housing like hotels, motels, Boardrooms or sanction Encampments that include social services.",219,,
922,0.97,6378.538,6382.876,In the long run it means we need more housing.,219,,
923,0.97,6382.876,6386.713,That is how we solve the homelessness problem.,219,,
924,0.97,6386.713,6391.184,People don't choose to live on the streets.,219,,
925,0.97,6391.184,6396.089,Data shows that we are given the option of moving into a housing unit people will choose that.,219,,
926,0.97,6396.089,6398.725,When I observed the King Street encampment removal last week I spoke with Jacob.,219,,
927,0.97,6398.725,6402.262,He told me he has been moved many times.,219,,
928,0.97,6402.262,6409.236,The folks were there to take his name and information but housing never materialized.,219,,
929,0.97,6409.236,6412.839,I asked Jacob and his girlfriend if they would accept a hotel room if that was available.,219,,
930,0.97,6412.839,6417.21,In a heart beat he said.,219,,
931,0.97,6417.21,6419.846,"This is our question today, what is the appropriate public health response?",219,,
932,0.97,6419.846,6425.118,This strategy cannot be merely to move people from one neighborhood to another.,219,,
933,0.97,6425.118,6431.825,Our homeless population deserves better and so do the neighbors whose community is impacted by this.,219,,
934,0.97,6431.825,6440.333,The bill we are discussing today to quantify the policy not to remove Encampments during the Coronavirus in order to protect public health.,219,,
935,0.97,6440.333,6444.571,That is a directive issued by the Mayor on March 17.,219,,
936,0.97,6444.571,6452.112,We think it is important enough to put pen to paper the request to make a Ministry of changes went unanswered.,219,,
937,0.97,6452.112,6459.853,For the sake of Tamping down this information and fear Mongering that has been going on I think it is important to address with this bill will not do.,219,,
938,0.97,6459.853,6466.76,This bill does not limit private property owners ability to press charges for trespass.,219,,
939,0.97,6466.76,6489.916,"This bill does not allow camping in any place, public place in the city, that decision was made by the Ninth Circuit Court when it ruled in the Boise case and according to that decision as long as there is no option the government cannot come to life in digit homeless people for sleeping outdoors on public property on the false premise that they had Úa choice in the matter.",219,,
940,0.97,6489.916,6501.294,The Court said it was cruel and unusual punishment and a forced rules to stop homeless people from camping in public places when they have no place else to go.,219,,
941,0.97,6501.294,6513.24,"Despite some Tweets indicating that camping in public places is illegal in Seattle, the truth is the Ninth circuit ruled Criminalizing homelessness is cruel and unusual punishment.",219,,
942,0.97,6513.24,6519.346,"And this bill does not limit the police Department's ability to investigate crime, nor does it limit the fire Department's ability to respond to fire.",219,,
943,0.97,6519.346,6526.786,What this bill does do is make the city true to its word by Formalizing the Mayor's directive.,219,,
944,0.97,6526.786,6537.264,"It strengthens policy by putting it through a public health lens, pushing the city to follow CDC guidelines on providing adequate shelter.",219,,
945,0.97,6537.264,6552.245,"Over 100 Healthcare workers and human service providers, many of them work with--they ensure that city dollars are not spent on the tool that simply does not work, pushing people from one neighborhood to another.",219,,
946,0.97,6552.245,6564.457,"It shifts the focus of the navigation teams work from removal toward actual navigation providing outreach, connecting people to services and making referrals to adequate shelter.",219,,
947,0.97,6564.457,6566.493,That is something that everybody today has said they want.,219,,
948,0.97,6566.493,6577.304,I want to thank chief Scoggins for their work we value them keeping us safe during this crisis.,219,,
949,0.97,6577.304,6581.374,"Frankly, I think it is cynical to play on people's fears during this crisis.",219,,
950,0.97,6581.374,6589.616,I want to say that we have had many discussions with our thorough law Department and we are confident this bill will not interfere with your ability to do your work.,219,,
951,0.97,6589.616,6595.121,I want to thank the Council staff Tickly Jeff Sims who worked really hard on this.,219,,
952,0.97,6595.121,6598.591,Congratulations on your new baby.,219,,
953,0.97,6598.591,6604.064,I want to thank the central stuff for providing guidance with this busy city council.,219,,
954,0.97,6604.064,6609.603,We have great respect for the city workers and we appreciate all they do to support our offices.,219,,
955,0.97,6609.603,6618.044,I also want to think my own staff and I want to think Councilmember 14 for her contributions.,219,,
956,0.97,6618.044,6623.783,She has a few amendments that we will consider today and I think they will strengthen the bill.,219,,
957,0.97,6623.783,6630.457,"The last thing I want to say is I believe that we can work together to solve homelessness, but we cannot ignore the issues facing us right now.",219,,
958,0.97,6630.457,6632.525,Housing is a human right.,219,,
959,0.97,6632.525,6644.671,"We can and we should Prioritize housing and we should make sure that folks, especially during the emergency have what they need to be safe.",219,,
960,0.97,6644.671,6659.886,"I appreciate all the people who are a part of the discussion and it gives me hope that representatives from the executive apartment and legislative branch, advocates, neighbors, Healthcare providers, service providers can work together to solve this crisis.",219,,
961,0.97,6659.886,6665.191,"We need to move past what has not worked, embrace what has and do right.",219,,
962,0.97,6665.191,6668.495,I look over to our discussion today.,219,,
963,0.97,6668.495,6671.965,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,220,,
964,0.97,6671.965,6681.074,"I had Misspoken earlier, our first presentation is our panel with the deputy Mayors, the chiefs and director Hayes.",220,,
965,0.97,6681.074,6683.943,We will move to that panel verse.,220,,
966,0.97,6683.943,6701.127,"I want to welcome deputy Mayor Michael Phon and deputy Mayor Casey six killer, Seattle police chief Carmen best and fire chief Harold Scoggins as well as director public health Patty Hayes.",220,,
967,0.97,6701.127,6709.903,I am going to ask each member of the panel to go ahead and give opening remarks.,220,,
968,0.97,6709.903,6715.942,You can defer the opening remarks for questions if you would like to.,220,,
969,0.97,6715.942,6721.047,I will invite that if that is something you would like to do.,220,,
970,0.97,6721.047,6729.355,Then we will proceed to question and answer with this panel before moving on to the panel later this afternoon.,220,,
971,0.97,6729.355,6736.196,"I would ask, I am sure that a lot of us have a lot of questions.",220,,
972,0.97,6736.196,6746.039,"If we could reserve the balance of this conversation for an exchange of questions, that would be the most productive.",220,,
973,0.97,6746.039,6757.751,I want to make sure that you have a chance to provide opening statements so I will turn it over first two deputy Mayor Phon and then I think I will call each channel individually.,220,,
974,0.97,6757.751,6766.593,"If we were at the table we would go down the line, in zoom world it makes more sense to call people individually.",220,,
975,0.97,6766.593,6777.57,"We will start with deputy Mayor Phon and then [Indiscernible], chief Scoggins and director Hayes.",220,,
976,0.97,6777.57,6778.004,Good afternoon.,221,,
977,0.97,6778.004,6788.114,Council members thank you for giving the executives an opportunity to join you this afternoon in discussion about counsel bill 119796.,221,,
978,0.97,6788.114,6800.293,I do want to start by saying I can appreciate the councils desire and urgency to find strategies and a URGES to minimize the impact of Covid-19 on people experiencing homelessness.,221,,
979,0.97,6800.293,6811.037,It is the same desire and urgency that has led the Mayor to deploy more towards homeless response more than any other in the portfolio.,221,,
980,0.97,6811.037,6818.545,Putting us on a current trajectory a spending $140 million in 2020 alone on homelessness.,221,,
981,0.97,6818.545,6827.72,That is $44 million more than the city spends in 2019 and almost $100 million more in 2017.,221,,
982,0.97,6827.72,6842.902,"I say this because Covid-19 hit the region and we deployed unprecedented resources working with the county, to help support individuals who are was experiencing homelessness.",221,,
983,0.97,6842.902,6865.391,"Even as we are making tough decisions regarding our $300 million budget, I know you have heard in some detail, we will still be deploying approximately 40 million dollars additional to individuals experiencing homelessness for a new shelter, safer 24/7 places to be, meals, and hygiene services.",221,,
984,0.97,6865.391,6870.496,We are working daily with King County and public health for testing.,221,,
985,0.97,6870.496,6880.306,Resources from the shelters like Ppe and access to isolation and Warranting sites including the ones that have been set up in the county.,221,,
986,0.97,6880.306,6883.576,"Soon, we will bring to you our 2020 budget plan in June.",221,,
987,0.97,6883.576,6889.682,We will be making some serious and difficult choices.,221,,
988,0.97,6889.682,6896.789,We will outline our plan to use state and Federal resources on the greatest needs in our community including homelessness.,221,,
989,0.97,6896.789,6905.098,I want to emphasize that today's bill isn't the best reproach to helping unsheltered individuals meet their needs.,221,,
990,0.97,6905.098,6913.64,"In fact, we believe strongly that the most likely outcome if passed, it will have a detrimental impact on public health and safety.",221,,
991,0.97,6913.64,6924.217,"Not only in the people in the surrounding community that have extreme challenges, but also for individuals living within those Encampments themselves.",221,,
992,0.97,6924.217,6935.762,"In our presentation you will hear from chief best, chief Scoggins and deputy Mayor six killer how this jeopardizes the city's ability to effectively respond to public health and safety issues.",221,,
993,0.97,6935.762,6947.974,We hope in this discussion we can describe some of what I believe are unintended consequences that may not have been considered in the initial drafting of the bill.,221,,
994,0.97,6947.974,6965.291,"Simply put, it is hard to imagine that the--has been to prohibit the city and potentially removing the encampment in the presence of a confirmed case of Covid or Communicable disease is present to reduce further risk of exposure.",221,,
995,0.97,6965.291,6975.868,Or that the intent was to effectively stop the city from addressing unauthorized Encampments that present persistent dangerous criminal activity.,221,,
996,0.97,6975.868,6996.322,"Or two in overtly sanction Encampments on private property such as parks and green spaces in conflict with numerous rules and code elements, or to put at risk our first responders, firefighters and police officers that are here today heightening their risk as they respond to 911 calls.",221,,
997,0.97,6996.322,7010.403,Nor can I imagine that the intent was to introduce such a consequential will on May 18 and then have a voted nine days later with little opportunity for public engagement or comment.,221,,
998,0.97,7010.403,7023.116,"We have now seen and heard from thousands of people opposing this bill through signing of petitions, letters and Emails that have been sent to the Mayor and city council.",221,,
999,0.97,7023.116,7027.553,We urge the Council to oppose CB 119796.,221,,
1000,0.97,7027.553,7051.21,"There is no simple answer and solution to homelessness, there is no Two-Page bill that can capture the nuances and substitute for the professional judgment of police and firefighters, outreach workers, human service providers, responding to complex issues that present themselves and some--.",221,,
1001,0.97,7051.21,7063.556,"I agree with Councilmember Lewis, Councilmember Morales we are ready and willing to work with the Council to meet a shared set of policies around homelessness.",221,,
1002,0.97,7063.556,7065.158,This bill is not going to move us forward.,221,,
1003,0.97,7065.158,7069.862,I think you for the opportunity for opening remarks.,221,,
1004,0.97,7069.862,7078.771,"With that I would like to turn it over to deputy six killer, chief best and chief Scoggins.",221,,
1005,0.97,7078.771,7089.315,"I just want to say because I don't know if I made this clear, if you could hold your questions until the conclusion of all presentations, that would be great.",222,,
1006,0.97,7089.315,7090.716,Deputy six killer you are recognized.,222,,
1007,0.97,7090.716,7092.785,Good afternoon Council members.,223,,
1008,0.97,7092.785,7098.291,I'm going to begin my comments by grounding us in a few facts.,223,,
1009,0.97,7098.291,7106.399,"First, three months ago we found ourselves at the forefront of a global pandemic.",223,,
1010,0.97,7106.399,7117.343,With the Council support the Mayor issued an executive order focusing the city's attention on Covid-19Prevention and response efforts.,223,,
1011,0.97,7117.343,7125.351,"Second, with the threat of an outbreak among the 11,000 individuals experiencing homelessness across the region we knew we had to act urgently and execute a plan in partnership with King County.",223,,
1012,0.97,7125.351,7130.957,To stand up in the intensify shelters.,223,,
1013,0.97,7130.957,7153.379,"To stand up in recovery facilities to reduce resources Online, to expand access to hygiene facilities and importantly provide flexibility and provide contract so that city dollars can continue to provide Wraparound services in support of provider operations whether or not that individual is in Seattle or not.",223,,
1014,0.97,7153.379,7163.523,It is also worth noting during this time we deployed measures and investments to keep as many people as possible in their homes.,223,,
1015,0.97,7163.523,7171.397,"Third, the Mayor directed the navigation team to temporarily suspend normal operations and refocus on disease awareness and mitigation efforts.",223,,
1016,0.97,7171.397,7175.701,Since early March the navigation team has been one of the outreach teams in the field.,223,,
1017,0.97,7175.701,7188.414,In fact many providers have closed their doors or significantly curtailed services the navigation team is acting as the only resource available to individuals experiencing homelessness.,223,,
1018,0.97,7188.414,7194.587,In the fourth quarter of 2019 the navigation team conducted 303 Removals across all removal types.,223,,
1019,0.97,7194.587,7198.291,Since March the navigation team has conducted for to.,223,,
1020,0.97,7198.291,7212.038,The navigation team SEES first hand many of the inhumane and dangerous conditions that some Encampments pose to both the residence and the community.,223,,
1021,0.97,7212.038,7231.123,"As we struggle with stopping the spread of Covid-19 in the city, the city also bears responsibility to handle public safety under the leadership of chief Bast and chief Scoggins.",223,,
1022,0.97,7231.123,7233.759,To move individuals to safer places.,223,,
1023,0.97,7233.759,7244.837,"It is also the city's response really need to ensure accessibility to public right of ways streets, sidewalks, driveways, alloys and access to businesses.",223,,
1024,0.97,7244.837,7260.453,"During this time we have given a 2500 hygiene kits, we have provided hepatitis a--and nine meals completed 400 garbage and waste removal activities.",223,,
1025,0.97,7260.453,7268.694,And referred 300 individuals in two shelter.,223,,
1026,0.97,7268.694,7280.873,These efforts needed by support and guidance in Seattle County have been a success in protecting some of our most vulnerable neighbors.,223,,
1027,0.97,7280.873,7290.149,"While 20% of all Covid-19 cases in the region are associated with long-term care facilities, roughly 3% of cases involve individuals experiencing homelessness.",223,,
1028,0.97,7290.149,7295.354,We believe the measures we have taken in Seattle have saved lives including in our shelters.,223,,
1029,0.97,7295.354,7312.104,That is why Seattle and King County are looked to across the country as a model for how to quickly scale up a diverse range of housing and related support to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among individuals experiencing homelessness.,223,,
1030,0.97,7312.104,7315.608,"This is not to suggest that we have done all we can or should do, far from it.",223,,
1031,0.97,7315.608,7320.713,Until there is a vaccine we will be working every day to protect the most vulnerable.,223,,
1032,0.97,7320.713,7328.22,Much of our work is done knowing we are facing a $300 million gap in our budget.,223,,
1033,0.97,7328.22,7332.124,We will Prioritize our work to help those individuals experiencing homelessness.,223,,
1034,0.97,7332.124,7338.331,Lastly I want to address the recent Removals of Encampments that presented extreme circumstances.,223,,
1035,0.97,7338.331,7341.634,First for contacts.,223,,
1036,0.97,7341.634,7351.777,"First, each removal was preceded by weeks of engagement by the navigation team to connect individuals with services and offer referrals and shelter units.",223,,
1037,0.97,7351.777,7360.886,Despite weeks of engagement there continue to be a risk for individuals living within the Encampments in the surrounding community.,223,,
1038,0.97,7360.886,7372.898,"There, the navigation team work resulted in referring 29 people in two shelter leading up to the removal and referring additional eight people in the shelter on the day of the removal.",223,,
1039,0.97,7372.898,7381.707,"At the Cid, little Saigon despite engagement there continues to be serious safety concerns for individuals living in those Encampments in the surrounding community.",223,,
1040,0.97,7381.707,7394.019,The navigation team work resulted referring 88 people leading up to the Removals into shelter and additional 25 individuals into shelter on the day of both Removals.,223,,
1041,0.97,7394.019,7409.402,"Importantly, mobile, medical and street medical teams were engaged in both Encampments to screen for Covid-19, conduct testing when necessary and establish contact tracing capabilities.",223,,
1042,0.97,7409.402,7415.741,There is no question that the Encampments and the dangers they pose to the individuals living within them need to be addressed.,223,,
1043,0.97,7415.741,7423.883,With the legislation being considered today would limit our ability to deal with the basic responsibilities that we have.,223,,
1044,0.97,7423.883,7427.553,Thank you Mr. chairman I will turn it over to chief Bast.,223,,
1045,0.97,7427.553,7431.624,Thank you so much deputy Mayor.,224,,
1046,0.97,7431.624,7434.026,To make sure we are sticking to the rules.,224,,
1047,0.97,7434.026,7438.931,The chair will handed over to chief best.,224,,
1048,0.97,7438.931,7439.331,You are right.,225,,
1049,0.97,7439.331,7440.533,Thank you for joining us.,226,,
1050,0.97,7440.533,7441.167,The floor is yours.,226,,
1051,0.97,7441.167,7444.57,Thank you Councilmember.,227,,
1052,0.97,7444.57,7448.073,Good afternoon chairman Lewis and all of the other Council members.,227,,
1053,0.97,7448.073,7452.578,Thank you for having me here for the select committee hearing.,227,,
1054,0.97,7452.578,7453.779,I want to first take a moment.,227,,
1055,0.97,7453.779,7467.059,"I know this is not the topic, I cannot as an African-American woman and Seattle police chief be in a public meeting like this and not mention the tragic murder of George Floyd that occurred in Minneapolis on Monday.",227,,
1056,0.97,7467.059,7470.796,I am truly saddened and angry.,227,,
1057,0.97,7470.796,7479.171,Being a police officer is about service and protecting the sanctity of life.,227,,
1058,0.97,7479.171,7489.915,"All of policing needs to continue the commitment to building relationships and trust within our communities, especially, especially our communities of color who have experienced so much trauma in the justice system.",227,,
1059,0.97,7489.915,7492.985,That includes holding ourselves accountable.,227,,
1060,0.97,7492.985,7498.023,My thoughts and my prayers are with the family.,227,,
1061,0.97,7498.023,7501.427,Thank you for giving me a moment to say those few words.,227,,
1062,0.97,7501.427,7508.2,Back to the subject at hand about the navigation team.,227,,
1063,0.97,7508.2,7511.537,"As has been discussed, the Seattle police Department is one part of human services navigation team.",227,,
1064,0.97,7511.537,7514.44,Right now we have eight officers assigned to assist.,227,,
1065,0.97,7514.44,7521.447,The Seattle police Department knows very well that police actions do not resolve issues around homelessness and housing.,227,,
1066,0.97,7521.447,7534.46,"Rather, the officers are part of the navigation team because of their ability to make strong connections through three key areas, first and foremost relentless outreach.",227,,
1067,0.97,7534.46,7551.443,"Second, providing security for those service providers who are on the front lines every single day and the third addressing responsibilities given to us by acid . and parks of obstructions and hazards on public sidewalks.",227,,
1068,0.97,7551.443,7557.75,As the chief of police this is my primary responsibility to ensure and maintain the peace and order of the city.,227,,
1069,0.97,7557.75,7571.363,"Responding to calls for service and investigations, officers and detectives have become aware of public safety issues and almost every major encampment that has been addressed by the navigation team.",227,,
1070,0.97,7571.363,7577.536,I want to quickly touch on some of the most illustrative incidents.,227,,
1071,0.97,7577.536,7592.518,"Most the portly, being homeless, being mentally ill, battling addiction, fighting poverty, none of this is a crime, and we will not criminalize the homeless.",227,,
1072,0.97,7592.518,7595.321,"We will not criminalize people living in Encampments, they are not criminals.",227,,
1073,0.97,7595.321,7599.391,They are honorable in many ways and they need help.,227,,
1074,0.97,7599.391,7610.669,There are people who prey on them and exploit their situation for their own gain and to the detriment of every single person in this community.,227,,
1075,0.97,7610.669,7620.145,"A few of the incidents that I want to highlight for your consideration, in 2017, the navigation team cleaned the encampment that was at airport way South.",227,,
1076,0.97,7620.145,7641.367,This was done after two residents that were arrested for operating a child sex trafficking ring with several residents in the area calling the police and telling us there were X girls involve the youngest was 13.,227,,
1077,0.97,7641.367,7646.672,In 2018 task force works on a drug trafficking investigation involving silver Encampments.,227,,
1078,0.97,7646.672,7658.884,"They found an operation supplying heroine--heroin, Meth, crack along with cash and weapons.",227,,
1079,0.97,7658.884,7659.718,The suspects were residence.,227,,
1080,0.97,7659.718,7666.792,"They were not homeless, they were using the encampment as cover to maintain their illicit and criminal enterprises.",227,,
1081,0.97,7666.792,7673.232,"Just one year ago in May, officers seized over $20,000 in cash.",227,,
1082,0.97,7673.232,7695.888,"A pound of crack cocaine, heroin, Meth, pills, firearms, knives, machetes, and stolen property in predatory drug dealing and property theft in Encampments in Pioneer square and in Chinatown.",227,,
1083,0.97,7695.888,7700.526,In total 10 individuals were arrested for trafficking drugs out of the Encampments.,227,,
1084,0.97,7700.526,7714.94,"Most recently the Removals that took place near that navigation center at eighth Avenue South were preceded by increasing calls from the community and ultimately by acts of violence including a Homicide, shots fired and assaults with weapons.",227,,
1085,0.97,7714.94,7726.518,"Again, I have to be clear, the vast majority of individuals living outside are not engaging in major crime, they are trying to survive.",227,,
1086,0.97,7726.518,7732.858,Many are battling addiction and mental illness and they're trying to make a better life for them selves.,227,,
1087,0.97,7732.858,7736.061,"I know this firsthand, I have family members who are homeless.",227,,
1088,0.97,7736.061,7741.366,They are being victimized by criminals and by a criminal elements.,227,,
1089,0.97,7741.366,7746.839,Some of which live there and some of which open up operations at these Encampments.,227,,
1090,0.97,7746.839,7752.344,We must address the conditions that give rise to the problem.,227,,
1091,0.97,7752.344,7761.487,"Yes, we the police can go arrest criminals, more will come and take their place because these locations have victims and they provide good cover for illegal activity.",227,,
1092,0.97,7761.487,7767.326,There is often no choice if you want to stop further Victimization.,227,,
1093,0.97,7767.326,7769.795,We have to act.,227,,
1094,0.97,7769.795,7787.913,"Recently I was talking to a very distraught Lieutenant who spoke to me of trying to provide services to a man, this man was homeless, he was sitting in his own Feces, eating a sandwich that was covered with Magnets.",227,,
1095,0.97,7787.913,7792.484,They could not voluntarily commit him to because that does not meet the criteria.,227,,
1096,0.97,7792.484,7798.223,We also should recognize that person should not be allowed to remain in those conditions.,227,,
1097,0.97,7798.223,7810.435,"If that were my family member, I would want an officer, anyone coming by to help them and assist them.",227,,
1098,0.97,7810.435,7811.637,I will close by saying this.,227,,
1099,0.97,7811.637,7815.507,"If you want to make it acceptable for people to live in these conditions, this bill will do that.",227,,
1100,0.97,7815.507,7830.222,It is my charter and my responsibility that we take the situation seriously and as part of the Charter of the city to do so to protect the safety of every single member of our community.,227,,
1101,0.97,7830.222,7848.373,"If my officers are not allowed by way of a budget to address criminal activity that takes advantage of these situations, it is a huge, I mean this sincerely, a huge disservice to the community and to the people living there.",227,,
1102,0.97,7848.373,7849.441,It is a disservice to humanity.,227,,
1103,0.97,7849.441,7857.349,"If this activity is occurring with the individuals, they know the police Department will come and Intercede.",227,,
1104,0.97,7857.349,7866.558,It worries me greatly what will happen when they know no one is coming and they are allowed to operate with free reign?,227,,
1105,0.97,7866.558,7871.363,Thank you for allowing me a few minutes to express my concerns.,227,,
1106,0.97,7871.363,7874.6,Thank you chief best.,228,,
1107,0.97,7874.6,7877.669,We will now hear from chief Scoggins.,228,,
1108,0.97,7877.669,7885.177,Good afternoon.,229,,
1109,0.97,7885.177,7897.656,As a fire Department we must do what is necessary to prevent fires and keep our communities safe by following our mission of saving lives and protecting property.,229,,
1110,0.97,7897.656,7903.829,Many Encampments pose a significant public safety hazard and or concern.,229,,
1111,0.97,7903.829,7911.837,As an employer we must keep the safety of our personnel at the forefront and should not continue to put them into dangerous situations if possible.,229,,
1112,0.97,7911.837,7917.376,We know we are firefighters and we know there are some situations that will be dangerous.,229,,
1113,0.97,7917.376,7921.747,We try to prevent the ones that we can.,229,,
1114,0.97,7921.747,7924.349,Our members become firefighters because they are committed to serving the public.,229,,
1115,0.97,7924.349,7928.887,We can all help improve community safety and firefighter safety.,229,,
1116,0.97,7928.887,7932.925,I want to talk about safety concerns on two fronts.,229,,
1117,0.97,7932.925,7939.231,I will start with fire and transition into medical safety issues.,229,,
1118,0.97,7939.231,7960.352,"When people are burning anything outside weather for cooking, warming, recreation, there is always a safety risk for the people living at Encampments, their neighbors and the city firefighters who have to go into these environments and put them out.",229,,
1119,0.97,7960.352,7965.057,Some summer is historically the busiest month for outdoor fires.,229,,
1120,0.97,7965.057,7967.793,We continue to see dangerous fire hazards at homeless Encampments.,229,,
1121,0.97,7967.793,7979.204,"Since the beginning of tracking Covid-19 on February 28, we have responded to 126 fires and Encampments citywide.",229,,
1122,0.97,7979.204,7986.311,This is a significant increase by 15% from the same time period in 2019.,229,,
1123,0.97,7986.311,7989.915,The fire concern is Two- pronged.,229,,
1124,0.97,7989.915,8015.807,For people experiencing homelessness the concern is the potential of the fire spreading and lack of fire alarm or any type of system tents are highly flammable as we the all the time and located near brush or Combustible materials they do spread quickly from one tent to the next or up a hillside.,229,,
1125,0.97,8015.807,8022.247,Encampments do not have any alerting system in place to alert residents to evacuate.,229,,
1126,0.97,8022.247,8025.35,Typically lack of equipment to extinguish the fire before it gets out of control.,229,,
1127,0.97,8025.35,8038.029,Large piles of trash often found at Encampments are public health concerns and sources of fuel for the fire to grow as we often see.,229,,
1128,0.97,8038.029,8044.669,The second area of concern is for the firefighters who are was wanting to put out these fires.,229,,
1129,0.97,8044.669,8058.05,"Our members are frequently put into hazardous situations where butane and propane tanks explode and this happens quite often, needles and Feces are found on the ground that they must travel through.",229,,
1130,0.97,8058.05,8071.263,Access to the fire isn't issue forcing crews to respond via High-Traffic freeways or navigate up a contaminated and steep hillside.,229,,
1131,0.97,8071.263,8077.636,This often requires deep cleaning of equipment used for fire suppression.,229,,
1132,0.97,8077.636,8085.811,This also keeps the cruise out of service longer as we have to go back and do these Decontamination processes.,229,,
1133,0.97,8085.811,8097.255,"There are also many incidents where these fires are threatening the city's infrastructure including bridges, utility poles, highways, fire Hydrants and more.",229,,
1134,0.97,8097.255,8100.091,A recent example was on May 25.,229,,
1135,0.97,8100.091,8102.16,Crews extinguish a fire that engulfed several tents.,229,,
1136,0.97,8102.16,8106.531,A portable generator.,229,,
1137,0.97,8106.531,8115.54,Firefighters negotiated on a Hippity slippery hillside in order to reach the fire and encountered needles and other debris.,229,,
1138,0.97,8115.54,8126.651,Engineers from Harborview medical center notified crews that heavy smoke into their building Hvac system and people were able to smell smoke from inside the hospital.,229,,
1139,0.97,8126.651,8140.065,"As it relates to medical, in 2019, 80% of our responses were for medical emergencies totaling nearly 73,000 responses for the year.",229,,
1140,0.97,8140.065,8151.576,"Last year, 15% of these medical responses were from people believed to be experiencing homelessness just over 11,000 responses.",229,,
1141,0.97,8151.576,8166.024,"From February 28, when we started this Covid-19 crisis Útoday, we have responded to 2400 medical incident from people experiencing homelessness.",229,,
1142,0.97,8166.024,8167.392,The health concerns among this population is significant.,229,,
1143,0.97,8167.392,8170.962,We see it daily.,229,,
1144,0.97,8170.962,8176.801,"With the Covid-19 pandemic underway, the rate of transmission at Encampments could be extreme.",229,,
1145,0.97,8176.801,8183.808,This increases the stress level among responders going into these environments.,229,,

1150,0.97,8226.551,8244.603,"We are faced with the same access issues but sometimes they are a bit more difficult, as you can imagine it is easy to spot a fire, when we are navigating and negotiating the hillside of where we think an encampment is at 2:00 in the morning, it is unsafe on multiple fronts.",229,,
1151,0.97,8244.603,8252.844,We often require Seattle police escort into these areas just to keep our members safe.,229,,
1152,0.97,8252.844,8262.387,Councilmember Lewis you asked for our reasons and how we come to our decisions.,229,,

1161,0.97,8298.123,8308.299,I just wanted a brief overview of the public health approach and some of the work that we have done.,231,,
1162,0.97,8308.299,8325.183,It is really important for me to say as public health Seattle and King County I work with the county and the city and provide the view of public health role if people are expressing homelessness.,231,,
1163,0.97,8325.183,8364.355,I appreciate the comments on humanity and the tragedy of Covid on top of the trauma for people who are experiencing homelessness have on a Day-To- day basis and the need to really look to care for them and help them as well as dealing with the reality of the circumstance that we have in both the range of the settings for homeless service.,231,,

1186,0.97,8616.841,8649.574,"Before we get into questions, I think it will help frame the questions, to hear a brief overview, I should have done this at the top after Councilmember Morales gave her statement to have central staff briefly give an update on the materials that she distributed prior to the committee meeting and just an overview of the bill really quickly before we get into Qestions for the executive panel.",233,,
1187,0.97,8649.574,8664.088,"Allie, if you are on if you could just give an overview of the bill and what this proposal would and would not do and that can help frame our conversation.",233,,
1188,0.97,8664.088,8666.791,I am sure many folks have questions.,233,,
1189,0.97,8666.791,8671.696,I want to make sure that we got your presentation in first.,233,,
1190,0.97,8671.696,8679.237,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,234,,
1191,0.97,8679.237,8682.874,My colleague is also on the line.,234,,
1192,0.97,8682.874,8690.782,We thought we were later in the presentation so I am going to filibuster.,234,,
1193,0.97,8690.782,8705.596,"I see him popping in, I think he will provide a high-level overview of the bill and I will describe the amendments particularly a key amendment that is critical in clarifying what we understand the intent was by the bills monster and cosponsor.",234,,
1194,0.97,8705.596,8710.234,With that I will turn it over to Eric to do a quick overview.,234,,
1195,0.97,8710.234,8725.049,I did want to say it people could hold the I until we hear the whole bill.,235,,
1196,0.97,8725.049,8732.256,Is--I want to make sure they are visible and audible.,236,,
1197,0.97,8732.256,8745.169,At this moment I am going to share my screen so I can walk through some and then move it along for Allie ..,237,,
1198,0.97,8745.169,8747.638,That should now be visible to you.,237,,
1199,0.97,8747.638,8754.979,Here's a summary of counsel bill 119 796.,237,,
1200,0.97,8754.979,8756.848,This is what it is set up to do.,237,,
1201,0.97,8756.848,8763.287,The restriction is described on the right is restriction of funding from budget summary levels in the current budget.,237,,
1202,0.97,8763.287,8774.265,It restricts the funding to be spent on encampment removal and unless conditions are met.,237,,
1203,0.97,8774.265,8780.371,It excludes the transmission of clinical diseases including Covid and mutations.,237,,
1204,0.97,8780.371,8798.623,It poses an immediate hazard as defined in the file also known as--this file refers to guidelines established in 2017 with how departments coordinate for camp removal.,237,,
1205,0.97,8798.623,8811.636,Another aspect is it would have to obstruct the path of travel it would present a fire or safety hazard or be located in a children's play area.,237,,
1206,0.97,8811.636,8828.853,Just very quickly the conditions that would have to be at least one has to be present in an authorized encampment to allow for spending of the navigation team to do work through the current budget.,237,,
1207,0.97,8828.853,8836.16,Just to reiterate this is for the legislation as introduced.,237,,
1208,0.97,8836.16,8843.334,The next thing we jump right into is the amendments that have been prepared to the bill.,238,,
1209,0.97,8843.334,8845.536,I think Allie will take this up.,238,,
1210,0.97,8845.536,8848.84,"Thank you, Eric.",239,,
1211,0.97,8848.84,8861.852,"I will not spend a lot of time going into the details of the language in each amendment, but describe them at a higher level now we can dive in deeper after the panel discussion.",239,,
1212,0.97,8861.852,8876.467,"The first amendment is critical in that it clarifies the length of--if you can jump to slide ahead, the most critical piece of the legislation, one more slide.",239,,
1213,0.97,8876.467,8877.702,Thank you.,239,,
1214,0.97,8877.702,8889.18,The bill introduced would not allow funds be used to relocate or remove and encampment if the active health threat is in the presence of a Communicable disease.,239,,
1215,0.97,8889.18,8902.827,This clarifies what was intended if the reason for the encampment is an active health threat that is a Communicable disease such as Covid that the removal could proceed if certain conditions are met.,239,,
1216,0.97,8902.827,8914.839,That includes following guidance from CDC about how to provide sanitation services and other things to the occupants of the cabin.,239,,
1217,0.97,8914.839,8925.149,Acknowledging if an individual soldier is not available leaving and encampment in place may be balancing a number of risks and maybe the public health response.,239,,
1218,0.97,8925.149,8943.668,"It suggest that that's need to be taken first prior to posting a notice of removal so that in collaboration with public health expert, the city can determine what the best response is for the occupants of the encampment as well as the surrounding neighborhood.",239,,
1219,0.97,8943.668,8951.976,That is an important clarification about what funds could or could not be used for.,239,,
1220,0.97,8951.976,8973.097,"The second amendment is related to the provision in the proviso that would allow funds be used for relocation and removal, Eric, if you could jump to the next slide, one more.",239,,
1221,0.97,8973.097,8980.805,If the removal could proceed if it Obstructs the path of travel such that clearance from the encampment is not four feet wide or greater.,239,,
1222,0.97,8980.805,9015.139,"What this does is it at in language to say that if the obstruction could be addressed by Reconfiguring physical asked X of the encampment, but say there are 2010 and five are blocking the path of travel and the encampment could be Reconfigured to provide a safe path of travel but allow the encampment to remain in place, maybe that is a strategy that should be tried first and every effort should be made to work with the documents to connect them to appropriate housing.",239,,
1223,0.97,9015.139,9029.954,It is just sort of clarifying and adding in this concept of trying to balance whether encampment removal is the best public health response.,239,,
1224,0.97,9029.954,9034.525,"Finally, there is a third amendment not posted to the agenda that was estimated earlier.",239,,
1225,0.97,9034.525,9042.666,Amendments one and two are sponsored by Councilwoman--Councilmember Mosqueda.,239,,
1226,0.97,9042.666,9046.637,The third one addresses the public safety issues that have been raised.,239,,
1227,0.97,9046.637,9055.613,We interpreted the definition in the clerk file relating to immediate hazards.,239,,
1228,0.97,9055.613,9061.886,It would allow encampment relocation or removal if it meets the definition of hazard.,239,,
1229,0.97,9061.886,9066.957,The term hazard typically being understood as presenting a risk.,239,,
1230,0.97,9066.957,9080.371,We interpret that to mean if it was a public safety risk that posed a risk of serious injury or death that encampment removal can proceed.,239,,
1231,0.97,9080.371,9087.678,"We understand from the executive staff, that is not how they interpret the definition in previous encampment Removals.",239,,
1232,0.97,9087.678,9108.199,This says especially the encampment removal can remove if it poses a public safety risk that poses imminent threat to health and safety of occupants or surrounding neighborhood.,239,,
1233,0.97,9108.199,9120.344,These amendments are trying to Fine-Tune an address the legislation and with guidance from the CDC.,239,,
1234,0.97,9120.344,9122.88,We have copied and paste some of that directly from the CDC Website.,239,,
1235,0.97,9122.88,9126.05,Thank you so much.,240,,
1236,0.97,9126.05,9132.356,I appreciate that so we can all be on the same page.,240,,
1237,0.97,9132.356,9136.46,Can we exit out of this Powerpoint perfect.,240,,
1238,0.97,9136.46,9143.534,Now we can open it up to our panelists.,240,,
1239,0.97,9143.534,9164.655,Questions from the Councilmembers as per our routine if you signaled to me or text me and I will put you in the Queue.,240,,
1240,0.97,9164.655,9176.8,"Since we have a packed agenda and it is already 4:30, if you could keep your questions brief and if panelists could have their answers be responsive and to the point that would be appreciated.",240,,
1241,0.97,9176.8,9181.505,We want to get through as many questions as possible and move on.,240,,
1242,0.97,9181.505,9192.483,"With that, are there any folks who have questions for the members of the executive panel Councilmember Ted 12",240,,
1243,0.97,9192.483,9211.602,I would like to first preference my comments with information I received about the order of the Sacramento County health officer that was taken on May 22.,241,,
1244,0.97,9211.602,9244.835,"By the order of the Sacramento health officer Prefacing comment, the city of Sacramento it is 2019 when I count, counted 5570 individuals who were homeless, 70% of those individuals were--, homelessness profile not unlike Seattle.",241,,
1245,0.97,9244.835,9282.039,"The county so health officer for Sacramento County signed an Úorder on the 22nd saying CDC guidance for those rinsing homelessness outside of shelters is to be strictly enforced to maintain public health and safety, allow people living unsheltered in cars, Rvs, trailers or cameras to remain where they are unless the people living in those locations are provided with real-time access to individual rooms or housing units or households with appropriate accommodations including for disabilities and a clear plan to safely transport those Hassles.",241,,
1246,0.97,9282.039,9292.816,"The order goes on to say do not fights, clear or relocate encampment during the spread of Covid-19.",241,,
1247,0.97,9292.816,9301.325,"Do not remove property from people expressing homelessness which includes shelter, hygiene equipment, food supplies, water and personal items.",241,,
1248,0.97,9301.325,9309.9,Items for people who are living unsheltered designated as trash requested to be removed can be disposed of.,241,,
1249,0.97,9309.9,9320.911,Clearing encampment causes people to disperse throughout the community and break connection with service providers increasing the potential for infectious disease spread.,241,,
1250,0.97,9320.911,9330.821,Exceptions are Encampments that pose imminent public safety hazard such as a large Excavated area of the levy.,241,,
1251,0.97,9330.821,9333.357,I offer this to suggest two things.,241,,
1252,0.97,9333.357,9347.071,"One, this prohibition is much broader than on the legislation with Councilmember Mosqueda being contemplated.",241,,
1253,0.97,9347.071,9360.184,This legislation only applies the CDC guidance to Encampments that have been identified infections.,241,,
1254,0.97,9360.184,9382.206,"The other point that I think is important is, I do not believe the county of Sacramento has been up is law enforcement mission to prevent crimes and public safety threat with the passage of this emergency order by the county health officer.",241,,
1255,0.97,9382.206,9410.267,This is a question but it is a request for our King County public health officer to consider whether or not one way of the Politicizing this issue which is really something about science and best practices is to take it out of the policymakers here and consider a similar type of public health order.,241,,
1256,0.97,9410.267,9446.603,"As per my questions for director of public health, I would like to explore what the willingness of public health and director Hayes to work with the city in creating a protocol by which King County public health plays a role in confirming for the city that a removal is happening in a way that is consistent with public health best practices.",241,,
1257,0.97,9446.603,9466.089,The reason why I ask is I think the success of this policy really depends on the willingness of public health to work in this fashion and I have not been clear today how public health is Interfacing with the city.,241,,
1258,0.97,9466.089,9498.188,"During the removal act Mallard comments, I inquired with the city if public health was consulted on that removal and I was told that, because we offered housing to every individual camping in the area both leading up to and during the removal public health agreed with our assessment that we were and continue to be in alignment CDC guidance.",241,,
1259,0.97,9498.188,9513.237,The times story about that name encampment removal reported that public health had not discussed specific Encampments with the city but agreed with the CDC guidelines.,241,,
1260,0.97,9513.237,9555.479,"It would be helpful for me to understand, not just what happened in the past and whether or not public health engaged with the city, engaged with the navigation team leading up to the removal, what role public health is willing to play in this area moving forward so we can make sure the decisions the city is making to remove the Encampments is grounded in science and best public health practices and not being driven by the volume of volume of community complaints.",241,,
1261,0.97,9555.479,9557.881,Thank you for that question.,242,,
1262,0.97,9557.881,9583.907,Public health has a team and agreement with the city that we are notified and we go out and we have our managers and assessments will meet with those in the encampment.,242,,
1263,0.97,9583.907,9592.816,One thing made about the CDC guidance is that the CDC guidance is based upon the concern that people will first.,242,,
1264,0.97,9592.816,9606.43,"We put together a purposeful expert to make sure that we are contacting people, we do an assessment of them.",242,,
1265,0.97,9606.43,9620.043,"We want to set up a way if they do move that we can find them, just like if they went to a shelter we want to know what shelter was.",242,,
1266,0.97,9620.043,9627.351,At this Cobit crisis continues we have firmed up that relationship and we have been doing that.,242,,
1267,0.97,9627.351,9635.092,That assessment is available on both the county and the city side to work in partnership on this.,242,,
1268,0.97,9635.092,9644.468,"We clearly want to be able to do our job, continue our reduction approach.",242,,
1269,0.97,9644.468,9650.64,If people have Cobit make sure that they are availed of the Orenstein option.,242,,
1270,0.97,9650.64,9653.777,That is our job.,242,,
1271,0.97,9653.777,9656.446,A follow up to that.,243,,
1272,0.97,9656.446,9673.296,"I just want to understand, are you in this partnership in the agreement empowered to say to the navigation team we do not think the removal would be a best practice in this instance.",243,,
1273,0.97,9673.296,9685.675,"Most of the time when we show up at what ever site, it is about assessing what is the best way to manage within.",244,,
1274,0.97,9685.675,9701.091,"We do not go in with the attitude of proving anything or not, if the encampment is there we want to help those in the encampment.",244,,
1275,0.97,9701.091,9719.609,If we are called in because there is a public safety concern and there is a decision being made so we can do our job and make sure that folks are sheltered or be able to follow them wherever they are at.,244,,
1276,0.97,9719.609,9727.517,We have not taken approval or Non-Approval of those actions . 's,244,,
1277,0.97,9727.517,9754.544,"Just to be clear, my question is whether or not you have the power to approve or disapprove, whether or not you feel empowered as an agency whose job it is to public health to say we do not think removal would be a best practice in this instance with the understanding the city will do what it thinks in its own balancing act.",245,,
1278,0.97,9754.544,9766.89,"I do want to again, reference my opening remarks related to the Sacramento public health officer, they are seeing a different role for themselves.",245,,
1279,0.97,9766.89,9773.063,They are saying no encampment Removals with the exception of imminent hazards.,245,,
1280,0.97,9773.063,9786.51,They are working with somebody to make that determination on whether or not something is an imminent hazard that justifies a removal in contravention of the order.,245,,
1281,0.97,9786.51,9791.314,And I jumped in?,246,,
1282,0.97,9791.314,9796.987,"Councilmember, with all due respect, I have to take issue here.",247,,
1283,0.97,9796.987,9799.055,I just have to get it on the record.,247,,
1284,0.97,9799.055,9806.563,We have a fundamental disagreement on your reading of the CDC guidance.,247,,
1285,0.97,9806.563,9807.33,It is guidance.,247,,
1286,0.97,9807.33,9816.439,It says up front that all the different considerations that cities and localities are supposed to take in consideration.,247,,
1287,0.97,9816.439,9823.013,"In fact, we have, as I stated in my opening remarks, we have made adjustments consistent with the direction of the Mayor.",247,,
1288,0.97,9823.013,9826.85,We have gone from 303 Removals in the fourth order to four.,247,,
1289,0.97,9826.85,9835.358,I think the police and fire chiefs are situated pretty well with the issues that we have seen across the ground across those Encampments.,247,,
1290,0.97,9835.358,9842.465,While the same time fitting dozens of people into shelter for most locations.,247,,
1291,0.97,9842.465,9848.171,"Again, I do not understand the line of questioning here.",247,,
1292,0.97,9848.171,9853.41,"As I also said, we are working in close partnership with public health.",247,,
1293,0.97,9853.41,9864.921,That is why we have the medical team out in low Saigon and Chinatown construction Removals last week.,247,,
1294,0.97,9864.921,9891.615,"With all due respect, and directing my question to direct your Hayes is representation that she represents as director of the public health office of the county and she has advice to impart to the executive and to the navigation team.",248,,
1295,0.97,9891.615,9907.364,"I specifically said, with the understanding that she is not in the role of approving or Disapproving with the understanding that the navigation team will balance the advice related to the CDC guidance with other consideration.",248,,
1296,0.97,9907.364,9910.9,"Again, with all due respect I don't think you heard my question.",248,,
1297,0.97,9910.9,9920.71,I would really appreciate redirecting so I can stop Monopolizing the time and get my question answered.,248,,
1298,0.97,9920.71,9928.418,I just want to give director I do want to highlight answer.,249,,
1299,0.97,9928.418,9935.325,Agreement on this channel and I do believe that it is guidance.,249,,
1300,0.97,9935.325,9936.76,"Director Hayes, please.",249,,
1301,0.97,9936.76,9955.045,"What I will say in experience with my team, they are not shy about giving Real- time assessment and real-time opinions of what is going on.",250,,
1302,0.97,9955.045,9961.651,In the past we were dealing with therapy and living under bridges.,250,,
1303,0.97,9961.651,9973.296,We would do everything we can to make sure that they are safe in the situation or moved to a place that would be more appropriate.,250,,
1304,0.97,9973.296,9978.568,I don't want you to worry that we are vocal about what we see.,250,,
1305,0.97,9978.568,9987.31,"What you are talking about, I don't know.",250,,
1306,0.97,9987.31,9998.088,"Knowing the nurse practitioner and our nurses, you have met some of them, they are a shy lots.",250,,
1307,0.97,9998.088,10015.739,I want you to have confidence that we are out with this and truly talking to the folks--sometimes we have to call and make sure nine when one can get to the hospital.,250,,
1308,0.97,10015.739,10021.644,We start with the individual and what they need.,250,,
1309,0.97,10021.644,10032.422,That is a long answer to your question but it is important for you to know that we are present.,250,,
1310,0.97,10032.422,10033.423,Thank you.,251,,
1311,0.97,10033.423,10039.729,I have Councilmember Morales next.,252,,
1312,0.97,10039.729,10041.164,I did want to jump in.,252,,
1313,0.97,10041.164,10051.274,I think there are certain Foundational questions for the public and for this conversation that are implicit.,252,,
1314,0.97,10051.274,10058.181,"Counsel--Councilmember Herbold questioning, I want to flesh this out a little bit.",252,,
1315,0.97,10058.181,10063.486,I'm going to ask this now on and then Councilmember Morales is next.,252,,
1316,0.97,10063.486,10070.994,If you have a question send me a text or Email.,252,,
1317,0.97,10070.994,10074.13,I just want to ask a few clarifying questions from director Hayes before we move forward.,252,,
1318,0.97,10074.13,10090.747,I think the crux of some of these positions is understanding the guidance and related to the fact that it is guidance that has come from public health and the CDC on regarding the removal of Encampments.,252,,
1319,0.97,10090.747,10094.784,I will ask these questions all at once to director Hayes.,252,,
1320,0.97,10094.784,10101.424,It is just clarity on what the guidance is.,252,,
1321,0.97,10101.424,10105.361,I think there is a lot of familiarity here but I think it does frame a conversation.,252,,
1322,0.97,10105.361,10122.679,Also may be an overview in the efforts that the public health has been making in the efforts that have been underway and how public health guidance has informed those efforts in the shelters in King County and Seattle.,252,,
1323,0.97,10122.679,10143.366,And also how some of the different options that we have stand up to some of the guidance in the sense of tiny House villages for example and not recorded any positive cases of Covid so far even though they are semi Congregant settings.,252,,
1324,0.97,10143.366,10167.09,"I do want to say, the crutch crux of the question is the guidance, but are there ways for congregate or semi Congregant settings to take action that can bring them closer to the guideline of public health?",252,,
1325,0.97,10167.09,10177.267,I will start with the guidance and then get to--.,253,,
1326,0.97,10177.267,10180.904,They have put out a number of documents that they have been updating with time.,253,,
1327,0.97,10180.904,10192.882,I wanted to start saying for public health we have been in this since January when the first case was discovered.,253,,
1328,0.97,10192.882,10196.519,Over the last four months we have learned a lot.,253,,
1329,0.97,10196.519,10202.025,We had a CDC team out here working with us.,253,,
1330,0.97,10202.025,10216.239,"I think it is for the reasons, if I can just be proud for a minute that they actually cast the Seattle approach as a huge best practice.",253,,
1331,0.97,10216.239,10222.745,It's not say that--we could do better.,253,,
1332,0.97,10222.745,10256.446,"I think over time we have learned and as we have gone along, CDC recognizes that there is a range, they have guidance that was recognized as to what you need to do to--that was from work here in Seattle where we are working lifetime with them on what we need to do to shelter environment, what we could beef up with our Toolkit.",253,,
1333,0.97,10256.446,10271.094,"The CDC guidance also says, this has been quoted and I will quote again, their concern is clearing people to disperse.",253,,
1334,0.97,10271.094,10293.016,"What that tells us is that we actually have a range of options so we want to make sure no matter where a person was because we learned whether or not it is the shelter environment, people do move and we do not want to lose them.",253,,
1335,0.97,10293.016,10306.095,Cdc does say--if individual housing is not available--it is this range of things that we have to take into consideration.,253,,
1336,0.97,10306.095,10311.934,We look at what to do during this outbreak.,253,,
1337,0.97,10311.934,10322.845,"We have worked, we have done a number of things with the county.",253,,
1338,0.97,10322.845,10372.729,"We have actually worked in shelters that are known to have at risk people and CDC guidelines actually mentioned the to if you identify people who have chronic conditions and are older,--we look to work at into knowing that it was a vulnerable population so if we need to De-Intensify and give space and make sure that we are--one thing we have learned is the issue of showers being close by.",253,,
1339,0.97,10372.729,10379.502,Because we have medical we have been able to move that work.,253,,
1340,0.97,10379.502,10400.723,It was already going to Encampments but we have continued to have vaccination it is often challenging to get--for have a two vaccine at two different times.,253,,
1341,0.97,10400.723,10407.997,It is hard to get people to do those.,253,,
1342,0.97,10407.997,10423.012,We have also been doing technical assistance with the community organizations as they have looked to what they can do.,253,,
1343,0.97,10423.012,10433.756,We haven't even about helping folks who are service providers who need to protect their staff.,253,,
1344,0.97,10433.756,10437.26,I myself had one of my striking members come down with it.,253,,
1345,0.97,10437.26,10438.661,Goodness she recovered quickly.,253,,
1346,0.97,10438.661,10458.581,We had to quarantine 10 staff for two weeks at the beginning of the outbreak we continue to work our way through this.,253,,
1347,0.97,10458.581,10462.185,"That is the guidance, that is how we have applied it.",253,,
1348,0.97,10462.185,10474.597,"We have continued to work with CC when we have questions, I guess I will stop there.",253,,
1349,0.97,10474.597,10481.971,"Director Hayes, I might follow, but I want to let some of my colleagues in.",254,,
1350,0.97,10481.971,10485.641,Councilmember Morales has a question.,254,,
1351,0.97,10485.641,10490.68,I will let her jump in now.,254,,
1352,0.97,10490.68,10491.881,Thank you director Hayes.,255,,
1353,0.97,10491.881,10497.119,I think this I might actually be for the deputy Mayor.,255,,
1354,0.97,10497.119,10504.494,My question is for protecting public health during a removal.,255,,
1355,0.97,10504.494,10519.108,Director Hayes was talking about contacting people if they do have Coronavirus and they need to be brought in.,255,,
1356,0.97,10519.108,10527.45,If there is somebody waiting for test results and they get moved.,255,,
1357,0.97,10527.45,10546.269,"What is the plan or process for tracking where people go, if they are going to a shelter, if they are going to a tiny House village, really, how are people Útrack whether or not they accept shelter and whether or not they actually make it to a shelter that they would accept it.",255,,
1358,0.97,10546.269,10558.281,"There is a circumstance that we need to find somebody that has a test result, how are people tracked through the system",255,,
1359,0.97,10558.281,10561.183,Let me tell you what we are doing.,256,,
1360,0.97,10561.183,10570.526,If a person has been exposed and we need to test them they need to be Quarantined.,256,,
1361,0.97,10570.526,10574.397,We need to get that person actually in one of our quarantine sites.,256,,
1362,0.97,10574.397,10587.109,We have had folks refuse that and there have some that have had challenges that don't work well in that environment.,256,,
1363,0.97,10587.109,10593.015,On the whole we have been successful in doing that.,256,,
1364,0.97,10593.015,10598.521,In those cases where they have tested and nobody is exposed.,256,,
1365,0.97,10598.521,10610.099,We would wait for the test to get back.,256,,
1366,0.97,10610.099,10659.548,"For somebody who has been exposed but has been tested in one of our more broad testing, have done this in shelters and camps, if it comes back positive, our disease Instigators will then go through a process--we have a network out of the that we work with.",256,,
1367,0.97,10659.548,10677.7,"We start that individual and where they last worked, we have a pretty good track record that we like to say we were 100%, not always, those are some of the strategies that we use within our cases.",256,,
1368,0.97,10677.7,10692.782,"One follow-up to that, for people who ask beds at specific shelters, for whom there isn't something that me their needs.",257,,
1369,0.97,10692.782,10708.23,"They have a partner, pets, whatever the circumstance, how does the navigation team decide which options to offer a person based on their particular needs, whether or not they are testing or just in general.",257,,
1370,0.97,10708.23,10712.701,Can I answer?,258,,
1371,0.97,10712.701,10718.741,Mayor six killer and then any other Panelist who wants to address as well.,259,,
1372,0.97,10718.741,10725.848,"I just want to say number one in response to your first question, just to echo what director Hayes said.",260,,
1373,0.97,10725.848,10737.359,We have benefited at the front end of this by having the director reference this Edc here advising us and the work that we did together with the county as I Referenced in my opening comments.,260,,
1374,0.97,10737.359,10745.401,It really hits it is setting up Quarantined sites.,260,,
1375,0.97,10745.401,10753.442,Is setting up assessment recovery centers.,260,,
1376,0.97,10753.442,10768.524,We have an entire apparatus that has established in order to provide individuals who are symptomatic and otherwise do not have the ability to come inside and we lose track of them.,260,,
1377,0.97,10768.524,10779.502,The only way we can do that is with our strong partnership with the county and public health and it is very consistent with the CDC guidance.,260,,
1378,0.97,10779.502,10796.385,"The second part, the question about specific shelter, the navigation team, that is there role working with our outreach committee making sure that referrals me their needs.",260,,
1379,0.97,10796.385,10802.024,"Whether they are a couple, individual, they have pet.",260,,
1380,0.97,10802.024,10806.328,Not just removal but engaging folks throughout the day.,260,,
1381,0.97,10806.328,10817.64,That is one of our primary strategies for making sure that they offer a shelter that one will accept.,260,,
1382,0.97,10817.64,10819.542,To any other Panelist want to jump in on that?,261,,
1383,0.97,10819.542,10828.851,I think we can proceed to Councilmember Sawant question.,261,,
1384,0.97,10828.851,10829.652,Thank you.,262,,
1385,0.97,10829.652,10836.792,"I do have two questions, they are all related, obviously.",262,,
1386,0.97,10836.792,10849.471,Before I asked my question I want to preface the other questions with two comments one is I am probably Cosponsoring this bill that is under discussion.,262,,
1387,0.97,10849.471,10857.346,The bill Prioritizes public health in the interest of homeless neighbors over the suites that have been ineffective so far.,262,,
1388,0.97,10857.346,10875.598,"As many of you know my office has a broader movement alongside community members, transit riders Union, all of the activists that have been part of the movement for six years I think we need to acknowledge them.",262,,
1389,0.97,10875.598,10877.399,Without that movement we would not be discussing this.,262,,
1390,0.97,10877.399,10905.227,"I also want to note this interesting thing that I noticed, the Chamber of Commerce and the people who are opposing this bill are the same entities that oppose the solutions to address homelessness such as urgently passing the acts on big business to raise revenue to make sure that we have funding for social housing and for expanded services and going the opposite direction from prosperity.",262,,
1391,0.97,10905.227,10923.879,We hear constantly from the Mayor's representatives that they are readying themselves for 300 million as opposed to finding solutions to address the shortfall and expand those revenues which we are going to need to do if there is actual agreement that we will address those.,262,,
1392,0.97,10923.879,10931.053,"On the questions that I have, I would like some specific responses to these questions.",262,,
1393,0.97,10931.053,10947.269,"One is, pick any reason that you have done and can you tell us to have information as to where the residence of those recent Sweeps have gone?",262,,
1394,0.97,10947.269,10953.976,I think there were references for some of the individuals who spoke on the panel that that information is being tracked.,262,,
1395,0.97,10953.976,10957.379,I am not interested in generic responses.,262,,
1396,0.97,10957.379,10965.387,We know that what works.,262,,
1397,0.97,10965.387,10990.379,What is the information that you have on these specific human beings that you are talking about when after the suites were done and then so that we can look at that and send that information to the active community members who witnessed it so that we have some that we can ask community members themselves.,262,,
1398,0.97,10990.379,10998.253,I have not come across a single homeless person who said a certain suite help them improve their situation.,262,,
1399,0.97,10998.253,10999.288,My question is very specific.,262,,
1400,0.97,10999.288,11000.489,Can you give us that information?,262,,
1401,0.97,11000.489,11006.795,"The second question is, I will ask both my questions so the panelists can answer them.",262,,
1402,0.97,11006.795,11022.111,"The second question is, in the CDC guidelines, if you do not agree with the CDC Guidelies or--does not agree is admitted.",262,,
1403,0.97,11022.111,11023.045,This Edc guideline is clear.,262,,
1404,0.97,11023.045,11031.186,If and individual housing option is not available allow people who are living in shelter to remain where they are.,262,,
1405,0.97,11031.186,11049.872,It is not ambiguous it is very clear and the next statement says clearing Encampments could cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service writers and this increases the potential for the infectious disease spread.,262,,
1406,0.97,11049.872,11053.008,Is there agreement that this is accurate from a public health standpoint.,262,,
1407,0.97,11053.008,11083.005,"My next question following that is, the rest of the guidelines for this Edc office they that we should work together community coalition members to create sanitation in Encampments and ensure rest so these are--and remain open to people expressing homelessness.",262,,
1408,0.97,11083.005,11085.374,Providing trains with Handwashing facilities and so on.,262,,
1409,0.97,11085.374,11092.114,These should be with hand Sanitizer.,262,,
1410,0.97,11092.114,11095.584,I did not read every single word but you get the drift of its.,262,,
1411,0.97,11095.584,11105.627,"Question is, how much of these guidelines has been fulfilled by the various departments in terms of providing Restrooms with access to that.",263,,
1412,0.97,11105.627,11115.737,"And that should be open 24 hours a day and if toilets are not available, how has access to portable Latrines been provided.",263,,
1413,0.97,11115.737,11119.341,I would appreciate concrete ideas on that.,263,,
1414,0.97,11119.341,11132.12,"My three Russians are aware of the residence from the recent Sweeps on second, thus the Mayor's office and does the Mayor agree with the CDC guidelines.",263,,
1415,0.97,11132.12,11143.332,"And third, what is done in terms of access, access to hand Sanitizer's and so forth.",263,,
1416,0.97,11143.332,11148.37,Who wants to start with those questions asked,264,,
1417,0.97,11148.37,11161.383,I want to refer to director Hayes on the CDC guidance.,265,,
1418,0.97,11161.383,11165.654,I don't have any more to say on the guidance.,266,,
1419,0.97,11165.654,11181.703,"My comments if I clarify this, the tracking I am talking about is those people who we have tested, I want to be clear it is not public health just keeping a list of everybody in the encampment that moves.",266,,
1420,0.97,11181.703,11192.614,I did not want to Misrepresent that.,266,,
1421,0.97,11192.614,11196.118,We want to work to make sure that we can follow it up.,266,,
1422,0.97,11196.118,11204.026,I think you are referring most of your Russians to--.,266,,
1423,0.97,11204.026,11219.841,"For individuals who have accepted shelter since March, yes, we do know both offers have been made and how many of those referrals have been accepted and where those individuals are today.",267,,
1424,0.97,11219.841,11235.924,As director Hayes just said we have gone out and engage with the medical team and others and established contact with others.,267,,
1425,0.97,11235.924,11238.727,We established when we could be in touch with those individuals.,267,,
1426,0.97,11247.803,11249.938,We do not always know where those individuals are.,267,,
1427,0.97,11249.938,11252.24,I think that might answer your question.,267,,
1428,0.97,11252.24,11263.552,I'm happy to provide to counsel a listing in the referrals I was see without names.,267,,
1429,0.97,11263.552,11269.658,That we have--referrals that we have made and where they are now.,267,,
1430,0.97,11269.658,11285.507,"If that is something that would I'm sorry I wasn't trying to suggest we are in disagreement or don't believe in the guidance, we absolutely do.",267,,
1431,0.97,11285.507,11296.885,"As I said, since day one we have been working with public health, CDC, State Department of health and others, to inform the decisions and the policies that we are pursuing.",267,,
1432,0.97,11296.885,11314.136,"I was simply trying to say that it is guidance, and it acknowledges that there are other factors sometimes that impact our decision-making.",267,,
1433,0.97,11314.136,11317.639,"But again, we have worked very hard to engage individuals get as many people inside as possible.",267,,
1434,0.97,11317.639,11327.749,Prior to having to take any type of action for Removals.,267,,
1435,0.97,11327.749,11328.75,"The third question, hygiene?",267,,
1436,0.97,11328.75,11336.091,As you know we have been working to stand up hygiene facilities.,267,,
1437,0.97,11336.091,11337.292,And opening up several library branches.,267,,
1438,0.97,11337.292,11354.976,"We continue to receive and put both Council members directly and other community members, specific areas, geographic areas across the we can deploy more hygiene and be more responsive to those requests.",267,,
1439,0.97,11354.976,11360.382,All right.,268,,
1440,0.97,11360.382,11365.387,"Thank you, Councilman crippled has another question.",268,,
1441,0.97,11365.387,11366.555,I do.,269,,
1442,0.97,11366.555,11389.711,"This question relates specifically to the issues around public health, public safety, and would be questions that I would invite the chief and to respond to.",269,,
1443,0.97,11389.711,11397.386,The deputy Mayor raise concerns about public safety in his letter to the Council.,269,,
1444,0.97,11397.386,11411.633,"I quote from that letter, according to the Department, some on authorized have been associated with negative behavior and criminal activity, in many cases individuals pray on those in the surrounding areas, and residents living within the accounts.",269,,
1445,0.97,11411.633,11457.379,"As chair of the committee with oversight, on public safety, I have offered to work with deputy Mayor thong and leaders at Hst, and the navigation team to try to develop a mandatory language to address their concerns around public health, I am concerned that without support from the executive, for this legislation, I will not have the opportunity to work with the executive on developing language that would be their concerns, nevertheless, as was Previewed in the staff presentation I've attempted to do so.",269,,
1446,0.97,11457.379,11470.959,"My questions are, you Referenced, you both Referenced types of situations that you've encountered were you believe that removing an entire encampment was the best tool to address public safety.",269,,
1447,0.97,11470.959,11503.658,But could you address how you balance that decision-making to remove an entire encampment for the actions of a few individuals with taking law enforcement action to address the person or people who are actually acting unlawfully and removing that person and/or their individual structure.,269,,
1448,0.97,11503.658,11505.293,That is one part of the question.,269,,
1449,0.97,11505.293,11542.731,"The second part is, given that removal of an encampment results in all of the residents scattering and relocating in a different place in the city, I'm concerned that there are public safety concerns about that affect in that people who maybe engaged in unlawful activity, are then not subject to the law enforcement actions of the police Department and believe that could create talent challenges or impediments to law enforcement.",269,,
1450,0.97,11542.731,11569.824,"And then Lastly, the language that I've offered to include in this ordinance to ensure public safety, allows for Encampments to be removed when those Encampments pose a public safety risk constituting an imminent threat to the health or safety of occupants for the surrounding neighborhood.",269,,
1451,0.97,11569.824,11578.9,I like to ask how that language would unnecessarily restrict your work to public safety.,269,,
1452,0.97,11578.9,11583.705,Thank you.,269,,
1453,0.97,11583.705,11585.574,Who wants to jump on the question?,270,,
1454,0.97,11585.574,11586.808,I think was directed to the chiefs.,270,,
1455,0.97,11586.808,11594.883,"I think, I refer to chief best in Chiefs Scoggins.",271,,
1456,0.97,11594.883,11598.353,I will follow up after they provide some perspective.,271,,
1457,0.97,11598.353,11600.088,Chief best you want to go first?,272,,
1458,0.97,11600.088,11609.431,"Thank you, thank you counsel for your attention and diligence in asking these questions.",273,,
1459,0.97,11609.431,11623.178,I would say that one of the things I mentioned with the fact that we can't arrest we can arrested to arrest people who are exploiting folks who are living in sheltered in these and cameras.,273,,
1460,0.97,11623.178,11645.0,"However we know also that there are always people coming back into these areas it is because of the vulnerability of the people at the Encampments, that they can operate under the cover of the tents, and hide behind those who are more vulnerable, and in many cases, Traumatizes people living in those cabinets.",273,,
1461,0.97,11645.0,11675.497,"When we have the situations occur, when we can see that there are spikes particularly in kinds of violence for example, Homicide, shootings, we feel it's important that we take note of that, but we also are supporting the human services Department in making the decision, that is not something that comes to me directly, but I absolutely support when those decisions are made.",273,,
1462,0.97,11675.497,11695.216,"As I noted in my notes to you, in a security capacity, we also engage, there's hazard separate from the encampment that we have the authority under those circumstances, from the parks Department, for that removal as well.",273,,
1463,0.97,11695.216,11702.524,"I think it's important, I have to privacy statements by saying, we are highly sensitive to the fact that everyone living in encampment is not a criminal.",273,,
1464,0.97,11702.524,11710.031,"That many of these people are highly vulnerable, living in very tragic conditions.",273,,
1465,0.97,11710.031,11714.135,We what we don't want to minimize the fact that we also know there are people who exploit the situations fully.,273,,
1466,0.97,11714.135,11721.342,That his wife we come in and make the arrest.,273,,
1467,0.97,11721.342,11728.85,"That is why if Hst provides a list, the places that need to be clear, we participate in that clearing.",273,,
1468,0.97,11728.85,11734.422,Not the decision.,273,,
1469,0.97,11734.422,11736.658,"Chief best, I did see, he wanted to talk.",274,,
1470,0.97,11736.658,11737.659,I got you on the list.,274,,
1471,0.97,11737.659,11745.366,Cheapest I do have a quick follow-up that is brief.,274,,
1472,0.97,11745.366,11762.851,"It is the fact that we now have an operational agreement, how that has been informed the Department's outreach and having interventions to get certain folks out of Encampments, that might pose public safety risk.",274,,
1473,0.97,11762.851,11774.162,"Your position as the chief, how that has been helpful and is working in the field.",274,,
1474,0.97,11774.162,11778.7,I see it's a good tool but is just getting underway.,275,,
1475,0.97,11778.7,11781.569,And right now I think they're working on the final agreements with the executive.,275,,
1476,0.97,11781.569,11788.276,"I do look forward to having any opportunity an option that we can, for people living in sheltered in the city.",275,,
1477,0.97,11788.276,11790.078,Thank you.,276,,
1478,0.97,11790.078,11798.586,She Scoggins I don't know if you want to get in on the question before we move to deputy Mayor.,276,,
1479,0.97,11798.586,11800.588,Yes I will cover it from two perspective.,277,,
1480,0.97,11800.588,11801.022,Fire and medical.,277,,
1481,0.97,11801.022,11818.306,"What we see is, in the campus, when there is a 10 fire, whether in the brush or on the street, the proximity of the other tenants generally burned so the rate of spread seems to be rapid.",277,,
1482,0.97,11818.306,11830.618,"And we have many examples of fires, the safety issue is real, they can be somewhat remote.",277,,
1483,0.97,11830.618,11858.58,"To take a bit more time to get to an encampment that is somewhat off the beaten path following the Smoker takes us longer, and when there's multiple tents there, and it's in the brush, we seen in the past, in front of the Hillsides, and some of these homes, it becomes a bit challenging if you are in and he can but you're going to be cooking, you want to be warm, there's going to be a heat source.",277,,
1484,0.97,11858.58,11859.747,We see it all the time.,277,,
1485,0.97,11859.747,11862.984,"On the medical side, it's important for us to get there in a timely manner.",277,,
1486,0.97,11862.984,11867.088,"When someone is having a heart attack, stroke, a serious medical condition.",277,,
1487,0.97,11867.088,11898.119,"When we respond to these locations, that are off the beaten path, it often takes longer for us to get there to serve the person who is really in need, as I mentioned earlier, just since this Covid- 19 response started, we are about 2400 medical responses, that's really significant when you're navigating and negotiating difficult terrain to get to the patient, to understand what the problem is to try to get them to medical care.",277,,
1488,0.97,11898.119,11899.787,Those are our concerns and they are very real.,277,,
1489,0.97,11899.787,11901.422,We see them every day.,277,,
1490,0.97,11901.422,11902.223,It's a lived experience.,277,,
1491,0.97,11902.223,11908.296,Thank you.,278,,
1492,0.97,11908.296,11909.597,Deputy Mayor do you have comments?,278,,
1493,0.97,11909.597,11911.466,"Before we move on, I do need a follow-up.",279,,
1494,0.97,11911.466,11970.591,"I do not feel, I'm sorry, I appreciate the recognition that both the fire Department and the police Department can do, individual law enforcement actions to address either individual instances of a campfire, and that the police Department can do individual law enforcement actions, against individuals who are preying on people in Encampments, but my question is, what is, what are the conditions under which you feel I is appropriate to shift from an individual law enforcement action, to believing that an entire encampment needs to be removed for the actions of those individuals, that is the piece I am struggling to understand.",279,,
1495,0.97,11970.591,11975.296,Thank you.,279,,
1496,0.97,11975.296,11976.497,She Scoggins or chief best?,280,,
1497,0.97,11976.497,11977.765,Do you have any comments.,280,,
1498,0.97,11977.765,11982.003,Was that directed towards police or fire?,281,,
1499,0.97,11982.003,11986.908,The proximity of the tents is what we see.,281,,
1500,0.97,11986.908,11991.379,"When people camp in large groups as they do, and we see it.",281,,
1501,0.97,11991.379,11996.417,"And we see when the fire start, they transition into brush and from tent to tent.",281,,
1502,0.97,11996.417,11997.018,It's very real.,281,,
1503,0.97,11997.018,12002.724,That's what we see.,281,,
1504,0.97,12002.724,12004.926,"Hundred 26 fires, since every 28, in Encampments.",281,,
1505,0.97,12004.926,12012.7,That's what we see.,281,,
1506,0.97,12012.7,12013.935,I will defer to chief best.,282,,
1507,0.97,12013.935,12021.342,At some point Councilmember I do have a few thoughts on this.,282,,
1508,0.97,12021.342,12023.077,Chief do you want to go first?,283,,
1509,0.97,12023.077,12023.845,"Yes, thank you.",284,,
1510,0.97,12023.845,12028.149,I was not quick enough on and beating myself.,284,,
1511,0.97,12028.149,12051.072,"One of the things I would look at is when we have a level of criminal activity and issues occurring where it is not safe to send officers in, because there's so much crime and activity, we cannot see what is happening, covert operations, we are getting reports of violence, acts of violence, people being victimized.",284,,
1512,0.97,12051.072,12058.379,"To the point that we realize it is not just one individual or a couple individuals, we have a criminal enterprise.",284,,
1513,0.97,12058.379,12068.556,"As I mentioned before, situations where we have pulled out Meth, heroin, pills, machetes, swords, stolen property, guns, all out of Encampments.",284,,
1514,0.97,12068.556,12087.008,Not because there were people there that were vulnerable but because there were but because there are people there who are taking advantage of the situation and exploiting what was happening there.,284,,
1515,0.97,12087.008,12092.613,"Making it incredibly unsafe for the people who are living there as well as for the officers, the firefighters, and anyone else who was trying to address attended.",284,,
1516,0.97,12092.613,12094.816,We have to take that into consideration.,284,,
1517,0.97,12094.816,12098.019,To have comments now?,285,,
1518,0.97,12098.019,12101.689,I will try to keep them brief.,286,,
1519,0.97,12101.689,12106.194,I appreciate your line of inquiry.,286,,
1520,0.97,12106.194,12106.561,On this point.,286,,
1521,0.97,12106.561,12109.997,You and I have had some discussion about this as well.,286,,
1522,0.97,12109.997,12119.407,I just want to point out I do think this illustrates one of the challenges that comes with legislating this space.,286,,
1523,0.97,12119.407,12144.065,"Part of it, as we've seen in the last couple of minutes, the chief stockings and chief best relied upon to make and their teams make professional judgments with a whole host of half factors associated with wind removal may be necessary based on the public safety component, and for that very reason, the Charter empowers the chief to have that responsibility.",286,,
1524,0.97,12144.065,12157.612,"And I think the dialogue is healthy for you and Councilmembers and for the public, to understand some of that nuance as far as what both chiefs and their departments have to consider before, in a consultation with, the other components.",286,,
1525,0.97,12157.612,12162.583,Before making those decisions.,286,,
1526,0.97,12162.583,12184.305,"But fundamentally, this is one of the reasons why we are such a strong opinion about whether this is really something that can be legislated and prescribed as opposed to the fact that there simply times when it comes to these scenarios, the executive need some flexibility in order to manage a whole host of factors.",286,,
1527,0.97,12184.305,12195.116,I know you appreciate this as we have talked about the conversation around the deed to the open to dialogue about continuous improvement in how we approach the space as far as our internal administrative rules.,286,,
1528,0.97,12195.116,12216.871,"But at the same time, it is for that reason that along with a whole host of other elements of legislation that we talked about, it makes this an incredibly complicated space to legislate and put in place the rigidity, the bill actually glanced down on chief best entire Federal budget to some extent.",286,,
1529,0.97,12216.871,12224.145,"In the proviso, in order to be engaged in encampment Removals.",286,,
1530,0.97,12224.145,12235.79,"Depended upon consultation with law or policy interpretation of that, that severely limits the chief's ability to address these situations if we are unable to actually have that conversation with that flexibility means.",286,,
1531,0.97,12235.79,12247.068,This is for the precise reason why we have been very reluctant to go down this path of a legislative solution to something that frankly I recognize that we should have more dialogue.,286,,
1532,0.97,12247.068,12249.37,I'm going to jump in.,287,,
1533,0.97,12249.37,12269.256,"I do want to highlight in my Queue questions, I have Councilmember Mosqueda, Councilmember Gonzalez, Councilmember Morales, it is 5:25, we do have another panel after this.",287,,
1534,0.97,12269.256,12271.092,I appreciate the severity this a very sensitive issue.,287,,
1535,0.97,12271.092,12275.296,"I think we should certainly be taking our time with it, to discuss this.",287,,
1536,0.97,12275.296,12302.59,"I did have a quick follow-up to the line of response, I want to ask, deputy Mayor, is the executive in a position where where they would be willing to have a dialogue with this Committee, around setting up the discussion to address this through the administrative roles?",287,,
1537,0.97,12302.59,12329.95,"That is how I read your last response to Councilmember Herbold, I can say, for a number of the members, I would love to have how we can structure that, and provide space to try to work some of these issues out, through that process.",287,,
1538,0.97,12329.95,12336.49,I wanted to give you a chance to clarify because I would like to follow up after the meeting about how we might be able to set a conversation like that out.,287,,
1539,0.97,12336.49,12341.962,Depending on the circumstances.,287,,
1540,0.97,12341.962,12345.366,I will answer briefly.,288,,
1541,0.97,12345.366,12355.176,"And also, defer to Debbie Mayer six killer.",288,,
1542,0.97,12355.176,12357.778,We are always open to the conversation of continuous improvement around the space.,288,,
1543,0.97,12357.778,12406.794,"The issue of when and how we proceed, that's a conversation we can have an effect we've had many conversations about looking at the various elements of how we do, not just this work but as far as our entire engagement, but that is a broader conversation, that we can talk about Intersubjective responsibilities as where will is the broader scope of the elements and homeless is a strategy that many of the Councilmembers have talked about, we are course happy to have that conversation but said that in the contexts, the broader context, about the issues we are dealing with Covid-19 right now, the issues we face with regard to the resource issues, as Councilmember Sawant and others have a perspective about.",288,,
1544,0.97,12406.794,12424.445,"But setting that in a broader context is better than having a granular discussion about, we've had a discussion about how the use of this blunt particular instrument is going to be an effective deployment of what you want to achieve.",288,,
1545,0.97,12424.445,12426.447,We are open to that dialogue.,288,,
1546,0.97,12426.447,12426.914,Thank you.,289,,
1547,0.97,12426.914,12427.815,Deputy Mayor Sixkiller?,289,,
1548,0.97,12427.815,12434.588,I don't know that I have anything to add beyond what he provided.,289,,
1549,0.97,12434.588,12435.823,"Certainly, count on hearing for me.",290,,
1550,0.97,12435.823,12437.057,In short order.,290,,
1551,0.97,12437.057,12448.836,About Formalizing that conversation because I share your eagerness and I will certainly take you up on your generous offer and I appreciate you bringing that up as part of this discussion.,290,,
1552,0.97,12448.836,12451.906,"Do want to get the opportunities to my colleagues, we have former questions.",290,,
1553,0.97,12451.906,12455.743,"Were former lines of questioning, I should say.",290,,
1554,0.97,12455.743,12460.948,More accurately.,290,,
1555,0.97,12460.948,12469.79,"Councilmember thanks for being part of this lineup, we know your team and you, yours incredibly busy.",290,,
1556,0.97,12469.79,12473.027,I appreciate all that you are doing in this time to save lives and prevent infection.,290,,
1557,0.97,12473.027,12503.691,"I'm going to put aside the comments that were made about safety, and recognizing, number one, that the Councilmember Herbold has an amendment that clarifies the ability for folks to go in and continued to maintain safety and number two, because we have this just launched the last week, this is a body that has been very supportive of Co-Lead and I think there's some frustration that it took a while to launch.",290,,
1558,0.97,12503.691,12526.447,"I do think that the more we can get Co-Lead into these areas, in a targeted way, as was described early on in a conversation with folks, in a way that recognizes we have high friction areas, we are targeted, directed, and we do referrals in specific sites have areas of concern, we can see more people getting House into services they need.",290,,
1559,0.97,12526.447,12532.152,"Setting aside those public safety comments that were made in large part by the panels earlier today, I want to ask a question specific to this legislation.",290,,
1560,0.97,12532.152,12552.172,"To your question, senior deputy director phone, what is the point of it, it is to respond to the CDC guidance that says, in the context of spread and transmission the risk associated with sleeping outdoors or in encampment indoors in a such as an emergency shelter other Congregant living facility.",290,,
1561,0.97,12552.172,12574.962,"Outer settings may allow people to increase physical distancing between themselves and others ."" there, that is the intent to say, if we do not have enough housing, and we don't have enough permanent housing, to bring housing, even tiny House villages, what is our alternative.",290,,
1562,0.97,12574.962,12603.09,"Originally, when I was looking and talking with folks in the Mayor's office, and across our colleagues, I think there was a shared interest in trying to identify as much funding as possible to open up to open up ox options that were not Congregant, but even with the Non-Congregant settings you have opened up, we do not have enough housing, originally we wanted to ask how we could move the 500 people who are currently in Congregant settings into individual rooms, and then the removal of the Internet what happens.",290,,
1563,0.97,12603.09,12634.855,"I think the question became, instead of posting a sign, that will create the unintended consequence of people dispersing into the community as the CDC talks about, what can we do to first get folks and housing, I do hope the amendments that central staff Walk-Through with the support of the prime sponsor, I hope that you will see that the intent is to make sure that folks get into housing, and into the safe housing that the CDC has deemed necessary during this time of Covid prior to any hosting going up.",290,,
1564,0.97,12634.855,12639.66,"The consequences of that, during a declared public health emergency, could cause death, and tremendous harm to our community.",290,,
1565,0.97,12639.66,12647.001,I want to put that into context.,290,,
1566,0.97,12647.001,12684.304,"I spent a lot of time focused on how we allocate additional funding to Non-Congregant settings, this counsel has allocated $1.4 billion of the funds to use for Non-Congregant shelter settings, we have ongoing conversations I know will happen in the next few weeks about the 13 millions of the state has allocated specifically for Non-Congregant housing, Ppe, health services and mail delivery, that was part of our grant I'm looking forward to deploying those dollars and we have FEMA dollars that can be used now, if we as general fund we can get 75% reimbursement if we spend it on responding to the pandemic and getting folks out of Non-Congregant shelters.",290,,
1567,0.97,12684.304,12701.321,"I'm asking, very pointed question, if we don't have enough housing, and we have entry hotel rooms for example, can we work together to try to get folks into hotels and motels as the CDC says?",290,,
1568,0.97,12701.321,12702.322,That's question number one.,290,,
1569,0.97,12702.322,12737.524,"Question number two is, if there is some philosophical objection about using hotel rooms, and/or a difference of opinion on the policy success despite the Seattle times coverage on what happened at the Red lion, if there is a barrier to getting folks into individual rooms, can you talk a little bit about housing options, you would consider so that we can get the 500 people in Congregant settings into individual rooms to protect their health, and have a place that we can respond to the CDC guidance that gets people into individual rooms or Noncovered soldiers, prior to any posting of that.",290,,
1570,0.97,12737.524,12773.594,"I believe for the deputy Mayors, and the executive, if I could be so bold to ask, if in your conversations with public health officials, have you talked at all about creative strategies that are perhaps not individual rooms in hotels and motels but are there other types of settings that you, from the public health perspective have seen as best practices during this time, that would be alternatives to folks living in tents?",290,,
1571,0.97,12773.594,12778.499,"Even though the CDC recognizes that sometimes that is safer than going inside, are there other types of structures that we are not thinking of?",290,,
1572,0.97,12778.499,12780.534,I hope that is okay to ask of you.,290,,
1573,0.97,12780.534,12781.168,Thank you Mr. chair.,290,,
1574,0.97,12781.168,12784.404,"Let me start, I'm sure others will fill in.",291,,
1575,0.97,12784.404,12789.51,Councilmember thank you for your question.,291,,
1576,0.97,12789.51,12792.913,"You and I have spent quite a bit of time talking about this, the last several days.",291,,
1577,0.97,12792.913,12796.817,As well as other topics.,291,,
1578,0.97,12796.817,12801.488,"Number one, the executive agrees, we need to be making every effort to get people inside.",291,,
1579,0.97,12801.488,12805.993,That effort began well before Covid-19.,291,,
1580,0.97,12805.993,12814.334,As part of the Mayor's path as well as the 95 units we brought on during this period of Covid- 19.,291,,
1581,0.97,12814.334,12823.21,"And so I would say to everyone, we are doing, a tremendous amount of work to bring people inside.",291,,
1582,0.97,12823.21,12832.319,Navigation team since March has helped get 300 people inside that had previously been living in sheltered.,291,,
1583,0.97,12832.319,12846.967,"Number two, we are open to a conversation, and we continue to do that work, as part of their response.",291,,
1584,0.97,12846.967,12850.637,"I know you will have many of those conversations, that is not the topic of the conversation today.",291,,
1585,0.97,12850.637,12862.983,"We are happy to come before the committee and talk more about how we are, different housing options that we have made available as a city, and in partnership with the county.",291,,
1586,0.97,12862.983,12876.997,"But I also say, the CDC guidance, the CDC guidance, also speaks to how the steps we can take to make Congregant shelter safe.",291,,
1587,0.97,12876.997,12877.798,And we are doing that.,291,,
1588,0.97,12877.798,12881.201,We have been doing that and working with providers since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.,291,,
1589,0.97,12881.201,12887.774,"We have guidance from public health, the county how to do that.",291,,
1590,0.97,12887.774,12895.482,"We have a public health order, that allows us to seek reimbursement of funding from the FEMA to make shelters, Congregant shelters consistent with CDC guidance.",291,,
1591,0.97,12895.482,12909.93,"I want to be careful, as we target options, bringing additional option, options, making additional shelter options available, we don't Demonize, work at shelter.",291,,
1592,0.97,12909.93,12912.566,That is not what the CDC has said.,291,,
1593,0.97,12912.566,12917.137,I don't think it ever will be a part of our homelessness response.,291,,
1594,0.97,12917.137,12923.01,With thousands of individuals today living in Congregant shelter.,291,,
1595,0.97,12923.01,12925.545,"Is important, first understand.",291,,
1596,0.97,12925.545,12946.266,"One third of those individuals that are in sheltered a better that are unsheltered have been moved into some kind of shelter unit, with support from the city, as I said during opening comments, is Hsd custody money that is providing the Wraparound services including at the Red lion, is operated by Dsc.",291,,
1597,0.97,12946.266,12966.286,"We are open to that conversation and open to talking about what, are best practices, as we continue to learn more about Covid-19 and acknowledge that it is going to be a mix of things, whether Congregant shelter, hotels, tiny homes or, and every thing in between.",291,,
1598,0.97,12966.286,12983.07,"We look forward to working with you on that in the committee and counsel, and looking at what resources we have available to us as part of Covid-19 response but also understanding, that at some point, FEMA will declare that this is no longer an emergency.",291,,
1599,0.97,12983.07,12998.485,"And we are going to have to make sure, as the senior deputy Mayor Fong mentioned, that are $300 million budget can't sustain any new investments we are making over the long-term.",291,,
1600,0.97,12998.485,13006.994,"Again, and much larger conversation than the topic today, on this particular legislation, and I look forward to engaging with you, I know you have a lot of ideas and suggestions.",291,,
1601,0.97,13006.994,13009.663,We want to work with together with you to see what is possible.,291,,
1602,0.97,13009.663,13010.43,I want to clarify.,292,,
1603,0.97,13010.43,13019.606,"I do appreciate when you have a conversation about investments in the budget, in a post, but world what does that look like, thank you.",292,,
1604,0.97,13019.606,13061.448,"I need to clarify that this is a conversation about how many open rooms we have or how many base, how much space we have, that allows folks to get out of the cabin settings, the CDC guidance is saying to us that we don't have, if the CDC guidance is saying to us that we don't have a program housing, we are saying, we want to put folks into temporary housing, hotels, motels, we need to make sure we have an alternative for them to get out of the streets, I think we all have a shared goal, people are going to be safer and healthier if they have that room.",292,,
1605,0.97,13061.448,13064.084,If they have the staff capacity and the meals that they need.,292,,
1606,0.97,13064.084,13065.685,I get that there is a dollar question.,292,,
1607,0.97,13065.685,13067.354,But do we have any shelter capacity right now?,292,,
1608,0.97,13067.354,13073.226,Are we still trying to get folks out of Congregant shelters?,292,,
1609,0.97,13073.226,13077.497,"And if we don't have capacity, and we are trying to get folks out of Congregant shelters, what is the exit strategy?",292,,
1610,0.97,13077.497,13087.908,"What is the alternative for folks if you are suggesting that helping them with the Sanitation that is been requested by the CDC, is an alternative during this time of Covid-19 is not appropriate.",292,,
1611,0.97,13087.908,13090.911,What capacity we have to house looks right now and these housing options?,292,,
1612,0.97,13090.911,13104.524,"I want to say, we have Congregant shelter, is not unsafe, and again, I'm very concerned about it public narrative suggesting otherwise.",293,,
1613,0.97,13104.524,13107.027,"Úby testing, there is not been an outbreak in aggregate shelters.",293,,
1614,0.97,13107.027,13127.447,"We have one instance of that but that is what director Hayes reference, those individuals, they were Fed into the system that we developed to get them into quarantine isolation, to get them the resources they need to make sure we could control ...",293,,
1615,0.97,13127.447,13136.022,"And I jump in for a second, I think there might've been a miscommunication between Councilmember Mosqueda and the panel.",294,,
1616,0.97,13136.022,13148.602,"I don't think Councilmember Mosqueda was categorically suggesting that the D intensified Congregant settings, and follow the guidelines.",294,,
1617,0.97,13148.602,13153.673,I think the Councilmember questions was more to do we have an adequate number of those placements?,294,,
1618,0.97,13153.673,13163.383,To account for a One-For-One offer in the Cam and removal.,294,,
1619,0.97,13163.383,13169.523,"I'm looking at her to see if I accurately phrasing, I think that was more of her question then Lowe 's",294,,
1620,0.97,13169.523,13173.593,"As I said, in the fourth quarter of last year we conducted 300 Removals.",295,,
1621,0.97,13173.593,13178.665,We have done for since March.,295,,
1622,0.97,13178.665,13187.374,"And every instance, we had a shelter bed of some kind available to every single person who was there the day of the encampment removal.",295,,
1623,0.97,13187.374,13204.424,"Going forward with the current posture of the cities possibly future plans Removals, is that a policy the city intends to continue throughout the emergency?",296,,
1624,0.97,13204.424,13206.293,It would be the logical extension of that question.,296,,
1625,0.97,13206.293,13211.731,"It is always, it is been and will continue to be our priority is to get people inside.",297,,
1626,0.97,13211.731,13224.678,"Again, all four of these actions follow weeks and weeks of intensive engagement by the navigation team and other outreach workers.",297,,
1627,0.97,13224.678,13230.05,And we have other tools that are coming on as well.,297,,
1628,0.97,13230.05,13237.757,"Again, the reason I keep quoting the 300 Removals versus the forest because consistently the CDC guidance, we are leaving people, in place.",297,,
1629,0.97,13237.757,13253.073,"I want to make sure that the Councilmember, that Councilmember Mosqueda was getting the answer to your question.",298,,
1630,0.97,13253.073,13259.679,I thought there was was there another bastion Councilmember Mosqueda you had for director Hayes?,298,,
1631,0.97,13259.679,13260.48,Thank you so much.,299,,
1632,0.97,13260.48,13287.574,"For director Hayes, just wondering if there's other best practices you have seen across the country and other Buddhist polities, that you thought of alternatives to Congregant shelters and what type of the intensification strategies you have seen that may be short of a hotel room if we had a policy roadblock on that, do you have other thoughts about the what may be argued practices to deploy.",299,,
1633,0.97,13287.574,13288.975,I'm sorry for framing that so strangely.,299,,
1634,0.97,13288.975,13294.981,I understand what you are saying.,300,,
1635,0.97,13294.981,13297.317,"I have been sitting here, said U.S. a question trying to think.",300,,
1636,0.97,13297.317,13302.922,"I'm going to have to think right now, nothing is coming to mind right now.",300,,
1637,0.97,13302.922,13324.744,"On the National call, we are talking about this, really, they deployed such a wide range already, I spend more time talking about how we got to the strategies actually of the intensification, what that meant.",300,,
1638,0.97,13324.744,13369.189,"Because as you know, in the past, with the model that was used as you will recall, in San Diego for the hepatitis a outbreak, we had talked about this at the board of health, a large, I'm actually really grateful, because the De- intensification the way they restructure, now we can get FEMA tents that we actually talked with CDC about, they can actually get enough air flow if it is tall enough.",300,,
1639,0.97,13369.189,13378.098,"I don't know if any of you could see one of our up at shorelines that we had, CDC actually look at that for the airflow in it.",300,,
1640,0.97,13378.098,13397.817,"There's a lot of thinking by folks at the national level on how do you take something that might have been looking this way before, and modify it to the needs we need.",300,,
1641,0.97,13397.817,13400.52,So I will continue and look forward to thinking about that with you all.,300,,
1642,0.97,13400.52,13401.721,Thank you so much.,301,,
1643,0.97,13401.721,13404.524,We have two questions left.,301,,
1644,0.97,13404.524,13405.625,Councilmember Sawant the floor is yours.,301,,
1645,0.97,13405.625,13408.595,Thank you.,302,,
1646,0.97,13408.595,13431.751,"Just a few things, I think senior deputy Mayor Fong may have been more honest in the sense that I think he called the question, whether or not, there seems to be a fundamental difference between the Mayor's office and some Councilmembers, and myself included.",302,,
1647,0.97,13431.751,13467.687,"On whether or not the counsel has the highest legislative body has the right to legislate any aspect, especially in the situation we are in, with a pandemic, because, they're exaggerated is what this legislation would actually do, and I don't agree with, the characterizations from the Mayor, that this is going to tie their hands, clampdown on the ability to do anything.",302,,
1648,0.97,13467.687,13468.755,None of that is true.,302,,
1649,0.97,13468.755,13470.023,It's a very reasonable proposal.,302,,
1650,0.97,13470.023,13471.991,And it is based on CDC guidelines.,302,,
1651,0.97,13471.991,13490.076,"I do think that maybe it is better to be honest and I do appreciate, I don't think the deputy Mayor that that was the intention but there was an articulation of the fact that there might actually be a difference on that, before the discussions were had, you know where we all are.",302,,
1652,0.97,13490.076,13490.877,That is one thing.,302,,
1653,0.97,13490.877,13506.493,"The other, I'm quite struck by chief best, using the word crime showed up so many times, we are talking about homeless people, we are talking about the most vulnerable people.",302,,
1654,0.97,13506.493,13512.966,"Is not helping me to be honest, it's not helping me for SPD chief best to keep saying it's not the homeless people who are the criminals.",302,,
1655,0.97,13512.966,13513.433,"Okay, fine.",302,,
1656,0.97,13513.433,13524.143,That's even worse because you're admitting that the criminal activity was not being engaged in by the people who were even living there.,302,,
1657,0.97,13524.143,13526.846,In other words the case for the criminals were not living there.,302,,
1658,0.97,13526.846,13532.519,"And so, the people who ended up getting swept were innocent victims by your own admission.",302,,
1659,0.97,13532.519,13542.295,"It is true that the people, were victims of the suite, these were people who were not initiating any kind of criminal proceedings.",302,,
1660,0.97,13542.295,13546.933,I think that should lead to Councilmembers feeling quite disturbed by this.,302,,
1661,0.97,13546.933,13553.84,By the Mayor's office own admission that is true.,302,,
1662,0.97,13553.84,13602.989,"I also want to note, I'm not going to ask my questions again but I want to note for the record that I did not get any concrete answers from any of the panelists from the Mayor's representatives, about what actually, where my concrete questions, what is actually going to happen to people, who are being swept right now, as far as this thing is a black box, we don't know who they are, this is a very common narrative, it is not just in the last four months, deputy Mayor Sixkiller, this is something successive layers, representing the political establishment have had this line, the Supplication that they are willfully abusing something that they are good for them, that there's something wrong with them.",302,,
1663,0.97,13602.989,13607.56,We don't buy into that narrative.,302,,
1664,0.97,13607.56,13608.795,There is zero evidence to prove that.,302,,
1665,0.97,13608.795,13624.11,"As I said, not a single homeless person has come to me and said in public is it actually, the sweep help me, most people, people don't accept that because of the Tipperary nature of the, there are many things to go into why people refuse those things.",302,,
1666,0.97,13624.11,13638.324,"You heard from public testimonials, how people are forced to separate from their pets, from their loved ones, that's not acceptable to us, who are house, we should not be demanding that from people who are homeless.",302,,
1667,0.97,13638.324,13639.158,Because they are our neighbors.,302,,
1668,0.97,13639.158,13641.16,And they end up losing what little they do have.,302,,
1669,0.97,13641.16,13652.739,"And homeless neighbors, they have a completely different response when they're offered something like a tiny House village, with case management, with proper Restrooms.",302,,
1670,0.97,13652.739,13658.444,I would be interested in hearing what the next panel has to say about the questions that I brought up.,302,,
1671,0.97,13658.444,13668.588,"And a no, I think it's a it's ringing a little bit hollow to say that we are doing everything to find Permanen supportive housing.",302,,
1672,0.97,13668.588,13682.201,"Tiny House villages, the other thing in the room is the lack of revenues, there's an actual proposal, my office has brought forward, for the Amazon tax, an actual proposal.",302,,
1673,0.97,13682.201,13696.215,"If you have not read it bring your proposal for revenues but repeatedly stating that $300 million, stating, restating $300 million budget shortfall, as if it's an act of God, I think that has to be rejected.",302,,
1674,0.97,13696.215,13709.262,"Is basically what is happening, is a political establishment is imposing austerity already in the recession has only begun, I don't accept the $300 million budget shortfall, as a given, it's a question of political priorities.",302,,
1675,0.97,13709.262,13723.142,"Are going to actually raise the revenues, and that applies to making housing and tiny House villages and other options available that people can accept and come out of these accounts.",302,,
1676,0.97,13723.142,13728.514,"We all agree of course that Encampments are not a solution,",302,,

1678,0.97,13731.784,13735.254,I-40 said but I want to say.,304,,
1679,0.97,13735.254,13748.201,"I don't appreciate all Councilmembers allowed a lot of time to preface their arguments and questions politically, and I have the same right because I'm also an elected representative.",304,,
1680,0.97,13748.201,13753.406,And I want to note that I did not get any concrete responses I would be interested in hearing the panel on the same questions.,304,,
1681,0.97,13753.406,13756.976,Thank you so much.,305,,
1682,0.97,13756.976,13758.578,Senior deputy Mayor Fong do it respond?,305,,
1683,0.97,13758.578,13766.018,"I do appreciate the majority of the Councilmembers Councilmember Sawant's comments, I will interpret as Rhetorical.",306,,
1684,0.97,13766.018,13779.699,"On the one point, I truly respect the right of the city Council to legislate.",306,,
1685,0.97,13779.699,13783.169,If anyone can appreciate it is someone who has worked have his career in the Legislatve Department.,306,,
1686,0.97,13783.169,13788.808,"I would reminder the Council that the legislation in the form that it is taken here in this case, his emergency legislation under article 4 of the charter.",306,,
1687,0.97,13788.808,13790.877,"As such, since legislation requires the concurrence of the Mayor.",306,,
1688,0.97,13790.877,13794.313,In order to be effectuated.,306,,
1689,0.97,13794.313,13801.687,"By definition, this particular approach to legislation requires a collaborative approach with the Council of the Mayor.",306,,
1690,0.97,13801.687,13825.478,"Given that we were not consulted prior to the bills drafting, and a formal introduction, nor any city departments being consulted prior to introduction, I have to take issue with the reference that I am not challenging the right of the Legislature, the Council has a right to legislate.",306,,
1691,0.97,13825.478,13831.25,"But this particular vehicle that has been offered, is one that clearly States in article 4 that needs the Mayor's concurrence in order to be effectuated.",306,,
1692,0.97,13831.25,13832.952,I just want to clarify that for the record.,306,,
1693,0.97,13832.952,13837.356,As I did not hear the central staff or the chair speak to the emergency Ordinane to the nature of this bill.,306,,
1694,0.97,13837.356,13838.424,At the front of the meeting.,306,,
1695,0.97,13838.424,13838.825,Thank you.,306,,
1696,0.97,13838.825,13839.625,Thank you.,307,,
1697,0.97,13839.625,13853.539,"Me one final question for this panel, at that point, I may have a final closing question.",307,,
1698,0.97,13853.539,13856.943,But Councilmember Morales the floor is yours.,307,,
1699,0.97,13856.943,13858.211,I'm happy to ask my question.,308,,
1700,0.97,13858.211,13862.648,I did think that I heard Councilmember Gonzalez had a question.,308,,
1701,0.97,13862.648,13865.451,I will defer to her.,308,,
1702,0.97,13865.451,13866.852,Councilmember Gonzalez has Rudock with question.,309,,
1703,0.97,13866.852,13872.558,Okay.,310,,
1704,0.97,13872.558,13873.96,Thank you I appreciate that.,311,,
1705,0.97,13873.96,13875.595,I've at least three pages worth of questions.,311,,
1706,0.97,13875.595,13882.101,"In the interest of time I'm going to forgo asking, going to my deposition outline at this time.",311,,
1707,0.97,13882.101,13886.272,And I will yield my time to you Councilmember Morales.,311,,
1708,0.97,13886.272,13889.609,Okay.,312,,
1709,0.97,13889.609,13919.538,"I'm also troubled by what I'm hearing, from the the criminality, and the conversation around acknowledging that the drug trafficking and other problems that are happening, are actually happening, there problems that are being brought in, and that is still being used as an excuse to remove the entire Encampments.",312,,
1710,0.97,13919.538,13932.051,This bill does nothing to interfere with the police Department's ability to engage in the daily sort of activity that they need to do to identify the individuals who are Perpetrating whatever they might be Perpetrating.,312,,
1711,0.97,13932.051,13947.366,"But that is different from saying that that is a reason to remove people entirely, especially if you know that the people themselves, who by the way, that is where they are living, not engaged in the activity.",312,,
1712,0.97,13947.366,13951.971,I'm sure we will follow up on that.,312,,
1713,0.97,13951.971,13956.676,"But I do have another question which is, I did not hear the answer although I heard it asked a couple of times.",312,,
1714,0.97,13956.676,13966.185,I want to know how many Covid cases we have identified we know about both in Encampments and in the Congregant shelters.,312,,
1715,0.97,13966.185,13973.225,I'm also curious about what the plan is for distributing masks to people who are expressing homelessness.,312,,
1716,0.97,13973.225,13982.068,"And then the last question that I have is, I feel like I asked this before.",312,,
1717,0.97,13982.068,13983.202,And did not get an answer.,312,,
1718,0.97,13983.202,13985.571,How the navigation team is tracking shelter referrals.,312,,
1719,0.97,13985.571,13988.507,I will leave those there.,312,,
1720,0.97,13988.507,13991.777,And listened to what you have to say.,312,,
1721,0.97,13991.777,13998.918,"I will take the first, sorry I missed this question.",313,,
1722,0.97,13998.918,14010.896,"Off today's report, we don't have a category for Encampments.",313,,
1723,0.97,14010.896,14011.697,That I can see.,313,,
1724,0.97,14011.697,14014.333,I will check on it and get back to the cancel on that.,313,,
1725,0.97,14014.333,14015.735,On the Council on that.,313,,
1726,0.97,14015.735,14030.149,"We haven't shelters, there are to date, a total of 27 shelters that have had at least one case and just one death.",313,,
1727,0.97,14030.149,14034.42,"In supportive housing, we had 23.",313,,
1728,0.97,14034.42,14040.326,And if had at least one case and five in that area.,313,,
1729,0.97,14040.326,14041.761,And that is total.,313,,
1730,0.97,14041.761,14056.642,"That is not reflective of current outbreak which we move somebody to, we moved a facility, if they got two weeks without.",313,,
1731,0.97,14056.642,14070.189,"I will ask, we have 46 total cases and again total cases and homelessness is 266.",313,,
1732,0.97,14070.189,14079.098,So there's 46 that are isolated cases.,313,,
1733,0.97,14079.098,14103.923,"The Catchall for that either they might have been linked between a shelter and outside or someplace else, or we don't know where they were or they could be in a car I suppose.",313,,
1734,0.97,14103.923,14105.724,I will get that and get details for you.,313,,
1735,0.97,14105.724,14110.196,That is from today's report.,313,,
1736,0.97,14110.196,14150.603,"Let me, the referrals we've made in the shelter since the beginning of March, we have been tracking all of those referrals, as is generally,, were referrals have been accepted.",314,,
1737,0.97,14150.603,14167.686,"On happy to provide that information to the committee to see, we are seeing right now in this period of time, 70% of referrals being accepted.",314,,
1738,0.97,14167.686,14171.457,Is up from 40% Pre-Covid.,314,,
1739,0.97,14171.457,14177.196,I think that is a reflection of the navigation team's intensive efforts on the ground.,314,,
1740,0.97,14177.196,14180.9,Not just in Encampments but around the city.,314,,
1741,0.97,14180.9,14190.609,"It turns in terms of tracking, I would say, the navigation team makes referrals into shelters, and then coordinates their entry into that shelter.",314,,
1742,0.97,14190.609,14235.721,"It's the shelter's responsibility, the provider's responsibility I should say, to enroll that individual and Hmi s, and then perform a Covid-19 screening, again, assuming, again, based on the partnership we have with public health, the navigation team is engaging individuals on the street who have symptomatic, who are there presenting symptoms, or have some other medical condition or we have reason to believe, public health believes they beat needing medical attention or testing, that is something that public health is in the lead on and working with our team on as well.",314,,
1743,0.97,14235.721,14253.973,"And then specifically, en Masse, we have purchased masks and supplies, they been made available to service providers including the navigation team for distribution.",314,,
1744,0.97,14253.973,14254.239,Masks.,314,,
1745,0.97,14254.239,14256.875,"I can send you, I believe we sent a press release about that.",314,,
1746,0.97,14256.875,14260.079,I'm happy to forward that to your office as well.,314,,
1747,0.97,14260.079,14283.402,"I have a couple of quick closing questions, and I would appreciate quick responses from the panelists and I don't know, deputy Mayor Sixkiller if this is better for you or senior deputy Mayor Fong, but as Mayor Durkin to outlined earlier, senior deputy Mayor Fong, we are well aware of the posture of this legislation that it is emergency legislation.",315,,
1748,0.97,14283.402,14289.174,"If seven of us vote for it and send it to the Mayor, requires the Mayor's assent.",315,,
1749,0.97,14289.174,14306.258,"Deputy Mayor Sixkiller or deputy Mayor Fong, is there any Pathway given the amendments that a been introduced, and given the discussion today where you can envision assent from the executive on this legislation?",315,,
1750,0.97,14306.258,14315.634,"And if so, what kind of changes with the executive want to see?",315,,
1751,0.97,14315.634,14318.203,Councilmember I will take a stab at that.,316,,
1752,0.97,14318.203,14350.869,"I said a couple of times, through the course of our spirited discussion this afternoon, that fundamentally, they simply don't believe that this particular issue with regard to Kevin Roble's we think that we are open to dialogue, as I said a couple of times, in this discussion, to look at continuous improvement effort Rounder policies.",316,,
1753,0.97,14350.869,14354.64,They will decide that some issues that will raise are far beyond the issue of income and removal.,316,,
1754,0.97,14354.64,14363.282,It speaks to a broader policy and strategy around our overall efforts around homelessness.,316,,
1755,0.97,14363.282,14368.387,"I commit to you on behalf of the executive, that we welcome the conversation, and frankly, whether welcome, we have to have a conversation.",316,,
1756,0.97,14368.387,14381.166,"The truth is as we go into this budget balancing process for 2020, homelessness is a significant issue that we will all engage around policy discussion about.",316,,
1757,0.97,14381.166,14382.0,We look forward to that.,316,,
1758,0.97,14382.0,14391.944,We don't think that this bill related to encampment Removals is really the right vehicle for the correct approach so that we can have that more meaningful broader policy discussion.,316,,
1759,0.97,14391.944,14397.382,I will leave it at that.,316,,
1760,0.97,14397.382,14399.017,I appreciate that.,317,,
1761,0.97,14399.017,14419.738,"I don't have any other questions for the executive, it is 6 PM, I appreciate the patience of the folks in our next panel and I think we are ready to transition so I'm just going to call it at that.",317,,
1762,0.97,14419.738,14429.748,"I would think director Hayes, deputy Mayor Fong, deputy Mayor Sixkiller, chief best for providing so much time for us this afternoon and evening.",317,,
1763,0.97,14429.748,14432.151,"You for coming before this Committee, thank you so much.",317,,
1764,0.97,14432.151,14437.322,I want to move on now to our next panel.,317,,
1765,0.97,14437.322,14460.412,"And I do apologize to the members of this panel, that we are starting later than expected given that we had very long public comments earlier, and there were a lot of questions for our executive Stakeholders who are raising a lot of issues it was good that we were able to have that exchange and have our questions answered and get responses.",317,,
1766,0.97,14460.412,14505.49,"But now, we can move forward, to a panel of folks, who are here, to provide a wide-ranging diversity of community and service provider perspectives on this legislation, I want to welcome Jessica Quan, from Evergreen treatment services, I want to welcome the executive director of the Seattle King County coalition homelessness, the public defender Association, Elizabeth from the international community health services, the Ceo of the Indian health board, and from the Plater square Lisa Howard.",317,,
1767,0.97,14505.49,14521.139,"Thank you so much, everybody for sticking around, I apologize that we are starting probably an hour and half later than I thought, we would begin this panel, but thank you for your patience.",317,,
1768,0.97,14521.139,14528.647,"I will call folks out one by one, further comments like I did with the executive panel.",317,,
1769,0.97,14528.647,14535.654,"Again if we can try to keep the balance of time for answering questions I know my colleagues, and I have a lot of questions, and will look forward to your responses.",317,,
1770,0.97,14535.654,14545.33,"When we start out in the order that I introduce the panel, Jessica Quan, if you would like to go first.",317,,
1771,0.97,14545.33,14550.168,"Yes, I was wondering how much time I had,",318,,
1772,0.97,14550.168,14554.973,About a minute and half to two minutes.,319,,
1773,0.97,14554.973,14562.581,Not going to be a stickler for.,319,,
1774,0.97,14562.581,14573.058,Displays a people without a,319,,
1775,0.97,14576.662,14589.308,"And I respect how much effort they put in, but it is no secret that there are a not enough resources for those that live outside.",320,,
1776,0.97,14589.308,14592.644,The shelter available does not meet the need of the people.,320,,
1777,0.97,14592.644,14600.485,"One, with Pseudo-Epilepsy, displaced due to a caught or bed not available.",320,,
1778,0.97,14600.485,14607.593,A lot of people want to get into the navigation center but there were not enough beds for all of them.,320,,
1779,0.97,14607.593,14612.898,We know what resources work because the people ask for them.,320,,
1780,0.97,14612.898,14615.5,Having shelters available that people don't want is a waste of resources.,320,,
1781,0.97,14615.5,14623.241,"When there are not enough of the right resources to move to another community, this happens all over Seattle.",320,,
1782,0.97,14623.241,14626.712,People do not have a safe place to go or a way to move their stuff.,320,,
1783,0.97,14626.712,14634.82,"This is not a constructive way to move people to safe spaces, collaborating with providers.",320,,
1784,0.97,14634.82,14646.765,"For my own personal experience on outreach, I know from my own professional experience on outreach, people will practically move to hotels and enhanced shelters.",320,,
1785,0.97,14646.765,14651.47,"Many people asked the need to get them into navigation center, bridge or tiny homes.",320,,
1786,0.97,14651.47,14672.19,"I want people who are forced between--there are not enough resources where people are not sleeping on the floor, and where they can keep their autonomy.",320,,
1787,0.97,14672.19,14686.605,"In addition, policies in place should be clear to all parties, especially to people whose lives who include living on the streets.",320,,
1788,0.97,14686.605,14699.017,"When providers were told about how the Removals would stop unless deemed a hazard, and mated a response ability to inform people living on the streets of these policies and Covid-19 safety protocols so they can have information about the environment they are living in.",320,,
1789,0.97,14699.017,14713.031,"A lot of people found it helpful and took action cleaning their spaces and having their belongings out of the sidewalk, not having large fires, not setting up near building Entrances or exits or freeway ramps.",320,,
1790,0.97,14713.031,14720.739,Everyone I have talked to appreciate the information and I know that others have said the same.,320,,
1791,0.97,14720.739,14736.354,"I let them know their rights and resources, a lot of people do not know, a lot of them I gave trash bags and got them problem solved when their tent was too big for the sidewalk.",320,,
1792,0.97,14736.354,14740.826,Problem solving with them first before removing the entire encampment.,320,,
1793,0.97,14740.826,14746.965,When the Removals were posted people were not given much notice.,320,,
1794,0.97,14746.965,14754.239,People are asked why they were getting removed and I could not give them a specific reason.,320,,
1795,0.97,14754.239,14763.448,"Then the Removals happened, people were displaced and relocated to different areas of the community and then repeated.",320,,
1796,0.97,14763.448,14765.584,This happened before Covid-19 and is still happening after Covid-19.,320,,
1797,0.97,14765.584,14771.289,I have yet to find most of my clients.,320,,
1798,0.97,14771.289,14776.595,"People need time to pack their stuff, figuring out where to go and have not eaten or drinking water in the morning.",320,,
1799,0.97,14776.595,14782.2,There is lab machinery going on and people are watching them with media around and a high SPD presence.,320,,
1800,0.97,14782.2,14784.503,Is Dehumanizing.,320,,
1801,0.97,14784.503,14794.679,People are also told to wait so people in the encampment are told to wait until the time of the removal to see if there is openings at shelters that they are wanting.,320,,
1802,0.97,14794.679,14800.519,"When the removal happened, like I just illustrated it is an intense environment and not trauma informed.",320,,
1803,0.97,14800.519,14854.773,People are told to wait thank Y that was great.,320,,
1804,0.97,14854.773,14856.575,I appreciate you being here and sharing that.,320,,
1805,0.97,14856.575,14863.548,I want to remind fellow Councilmembers if you could hold questions until the entire panel has presented.,320,,
1806,0.97,14863.548,14866.384,Similar to the format of the last panel.,320,,

1814,0.97,14896.214,14903.321,And if there is time I am happy to share some of those extremely important first-hand accounts with you.,321,,
1815,0.97,14903.321,14907.626,My name is Allison and I am the director of the Seattle King County coalition on homelessness.,321,,
1816,0.97,14907.626,14915.233,I am a social worker and in affiliate faculty at the University of Washington school of public health.,321,,
1817,0.97,14915.233,14923.842,Before I came to the coalition I worked in the Epidemiology planning unit of the Seattle and King County for nearly a decade.,321,,
1818,0.97,14923.842,14929.347,"You may be surprised to hear me say this but I do want people to move, even in a pandemic.",321,,
1819,0.97,14929.347,14931.75,Only if it makes sense.,321,,
1820,0.97,14931.75,14937.355,And it only makes sense to move people under these extraordinary circumstances.,321,,
1821,0.97,14937.355,14949.167,When that movement is managed thoughtfully and planned and carried out in a way that supports that person getting into a safer and better housing or shelter option.,321,,
1822,0.97,14949.167,14953.872,"Unfortunately, that is rarely what is taking place.",321,,
1823,0.97,14953.872,15030.548,"I want to point out that it is not true that this legislation would cause people to camp Everywhere.To date is why can't our city bring resources to bear, to solve this critical public health situation, for people who are on sheltered, and for the people who are housed and work in those communities.",321,,
1824,0.97,15030.548,15042.627,"If there was ever a time to bring appropriate outreach and engagement and emergency housing resources to bear, to keep people who are at high risk of illness and death, safer, it is now.",321,,
1825,0.97,15042.627,15043.762,In a crisis.,321,,
1826,0.97,15043.762,15049.834,In this moment common sense has to prevail over politics.,321,,
1827,0.97,15049.834,15054.873,"Yes, a tremendous amount of work has been done, important work and in many cases good work.",321,,
1828,0.97,15054.873,15057.375,And it is continuing.,321,,
1829,0.97,15057.375,15063.648,"But yes, fewer than 100 new spaces of any type have been created.",321,,
1830,0.97,15063.648,15065.85,And overall we have lost capacity in our shelter system.,321,,
1831,0.97,15065.85,15072.39,I am happy to walk Councilmembers and executive staff through the analysis at another time.,321,,
1832,0.97,15072.39,15099.217,Responding to the Covid-19 outbreak should not be different than responding to any other contagious disease outbreak your with the exception of the fact that the specific nature of this new and highly Communicable disease does mean that it is now and will continue for the foreseeable future to be extremely difficult to rely on congregate shelters as the primary means of sheltering people in our community.,321,,
1833,0.97,15099.217,15101.219,Especially those people who are highly vulnerable to Covid-19.,321,,
1834,0.97,15101.219,15121.739,"As a matter of public health and public policy it is a terrible idea to move people around to make it harder for them to access services or stay connected to services, to deprive them of their personal possessions, medicine, expose them to the elements and predators and to generally criminalize their existence.",321,,
1835,0.97,15121.739,15125.343,Those things make it worse or the people on the ground.,321,,
1836,0.97,15125.343,15131.049,Whether they are lucky enough to have homes or whether they do not have homes.,321,,
1837,0.97,15131.049,15136.554,And these practices create impossible conditions for people who live and work in the neighborhood.,321,,
1838,0.97,15136.554,15141.126,"Again those that work in the shelter or homes, and those without.",321,,
1839,0.97,15141.126,15146.264,The actions that we are talking about are profoundly counterproductive and ill considered.,321,,
1840,0.97,15146.264,15154.772,"They are also, in my opinion, Ill-Informed by the basic understanding of Communicable disease and public health practices.",321,,
1841,0.97,15154.772,15174.759,"In fact, what the city is doing makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible to take the actions that are necessary from a public health perspective to assess each individual person's health and health risks to connect them to Healthcare and other services, and keep them connected to services they are connected to.",321,,
1842,0.97,15174.759,15179.197,To encourage people to seek care and agree to testing.,321,,
1843,0.97,15179.197,15183.067,To agree to go to isolation and quarantine if it is warranted.,321,,
1844,0.97,15183.067,15190.408,"And to participate in contact tracing, a crucial element whether we are talking about Hiv/Aids, hepatitis a or Covid- 19.",321,,
1845,0.97,15190.408,15197.382,"By continuing to displace people and disrupt their lives, the city is harming people and damaging trust.",321,,
1846,0.97,15197.382,15204.622,And undermining people's sense that there can be respectful and useful help at hand.,321,,
1847,0.97,15204.622,15208.726,It unnecessarily risks exposing people.,321,,
1848,0.97,15208.726,15217.835,"First responders, city employees, front-line workers, outreach staff, homeless people and housed people.",321,,
1849,0.97,15217.835,15227.145,"The city's current approach is failing public policy, failing to respond collectively to neighborhood and community concerns.",321,,
1850,0.97,15227.145,15232.517,"It is failing in the core responsibility of government to help people in a crisis, in ways that they are not able to help themselves.",321,,
1851,0.97,15232.517,15240.625,And it is making our work ahead more ethical.,321,,
1852,0.97,15240.625,15241.96,More difficult.,321,,
1853,0.97,15241.96,15245.363,I want to mention to you in response of some of the questions that Councilmembers have asked.,321,,
1854,0.97,15245.363,15256.174,"That today I received notice from an outreach worker who is a health professional that they had tested a client, camped outside on Weller street for Covid-19.",321,,
1855,0.97,15256.174,15262.947,And the test came back negative but they have been unable to locate that person to report the news.,321,,
1856,0.97,15262.947,15270.488,"They have been finding people who were swept, who are now in greater health crisis than before.",321,,
1857,0.97,15270.488,15274.659,Who are still unable to find anywhere to stay.,321,,
1858,0.97,15274.659,15286.604,"And just Finally, I want to tell you about a story and outreach worker called to tell me this morning because I asked if they knew anything about the people who were swept last week.",321,,
1859,0.97,15286.604,15297.682,"And this outreach worker reported to me that for two years he had been working with a young African-American person, under 21 years of age.",321,,
1860,0.97,15297.682,15313.231,"For two years he had been doing outreach with this person through his own changes in jobs, he had lost contact with this young person but found them again at Weller street, spent many hours working with them to get their paperwork in order.",321,,
1861,0.97,15313.231,15314.499,To apply for housing.,321,,
1862,0.97,15314.499,15328.112,"Met with the housing case manager in the tent on Weller street, and this young person's housing appointment was last Friday.",321,,
1863,0.97,15328.112,15338.122,"This outreach worker went at 8:00 in the morning on Thursday to try to find his client, having discussed the fact that the sweep was coming.",321,,
1864,0.97,15338.122,15341.325,The client said he would hang on as long as he could.,321,,
1865,0.97,15341.325,15345.963,The outreach worker has been unable to find his client.,321,,
1866,0.97,15345.963,15351.469,He has asked the housing provider to try to hold the space while he tries to find this young person.,321,,
1867,0.97,15351.469,15360.044,And what I think is that the city can do a whole lot better than we are currently doing for that young person.,321,,
1868,0.97,15360.044,15361.779,And for the outreach worker.,321,,
1869,0.97,15361.779,15376.661,And for all of us who surely understand that if we can agree on the rhetoric that we all really want to get to the same solution and House people and keep them safe always.,321,,
1870,0.97,15376.661,15379.697,Especially in the middle of a public health emergency.,321,,
1871,0.97,15379.697,15381.966,Then we have to do things differently.,321,,
1872,0.97,15381.966,15384.902,Thank you.,321,,
1873,0.97,15384.902,15387.405,"Allison, thank you so much for your comments.",322,,
1874,0.97,15387.405,15392.51,I want to move onto the next Panelist.,322,,
1875,0.97,15392.51,15395.713,-- Moss from the public defender Association.,322,,
1876,0.97,15395.713,15398.216,"Tara, take it away.",322,,
1877,0.97,15398.216,15399.884,My name is Tara by the way.,323,,
1878,0.97,15399.884,15402.086,I am so sorry.,324,,
1879,0.97,15402.086,15405.723,I actually am able to clarify so I appreciate.,325,,
1880,0.97,15405.723,15407.291,I am sorry.,326,,
1881,0.97,15407.291,15408.626,Proceed.,326,,
1882,0.97,15408.626,15415.233,I want to thank you all for allowing us to stay late and talk and share perspectives.,327,,
1883,0.97,15415.233,15427.044,"Especially I appreciate, I believe either chief best called the outreach workers and service Dividers essential workers and they very much are during this time.",327,,
1884,0.97,15427.044,15432.95,Going out on the streets while so many of us say home because they care so much about their clients and what is happening to them.,327,,
1885,0.97,15432.95,15444.662,"I would say that we leave that, and we agree with people, within the community, that we cannot just leave people out there on the streets.",327,,
1886,0.97,15444.662,15451.836,"We cannot leave vulnerable folks without supportive systems, health, and a safe place to go.",327,,
1887,0.97,15451.836,15461.379,"The crime that people are talking about, the concerns of business owners and other neighbors have, are real.",327,,
1888,0.97,15461.379,15466.35,Those same concerns exist even with those who are existing in tent encampment.,327,,
1889,0.97,15466.35,15473.691,"So it is really important that, that it is clear that we cannot just leave individuals out there.",327,,
1890,0.97,15473.691,15480.465,"At the same time, just moving individuals without a plan that others have talked about, more explicitly, is also a concern.",327,,
1891,0.97,15480.465,15484.902,We agree we cannot do that either.,327,,
1892,0.97,15484.902,15489.173,"What we, we also need to recognize that there are not that many resources, especially right now for clients to go to.",327,,
1893,0.97,15489.173,15491.409,People need help.,327,,
1894,0.97,15491.409,15494.912,They need strategies about what to do.,327,,
1895,0.97,15494.912,15501.819,And they need the support that they have become used to and have been privileged enough to access that.,327,,
1896,0.97,15501.819,15521.439,"What we have found within Co- lead and lead, with using hotels with low occupancy rates and intensive case management has been effective and has allowed people to stabilize and reduced drug use, and has allowed for more access to sanitation Facilites and basic needs met.",327,,
1897,0.97,15521.439,15531.449,"I heard a lot of individuals saying other tiny homes, talking about the ability that they have and their concern about the stability being shaken.",327,,
1898,0.97,15531.449,15532.683,With their moves.,327,,
1899,0.97,15532.683,15544.529,"So, we have really found that for low-level drug users, people with low-level mental health services, really benefit from being in hotels and being stabilized.",327,,
1900,0.97,15544.529,15560.678,We have also found that the harm reduction base services and individual base services really has created an effective stabilization for this population.,327,,
1901,0.97,15560.678,15569.253,"As well as once those individuals are in those hotels, constant staffing and support Incoordination within the hotels.",327,,
1902,0.97,15569.253,15582.733,"But, there is something that I really want to take a moment to highlight, and that is something I have heard from business owners and the larger community, around the populations that they are concerned about with tent and cabinets.",327,,
1903,0.97,15582.733,15591.309,"And that is people who are display more concerning behavior, or increased threats of safety.",327,,
1904,0.97,15591.309,15598.816,"I will say that the service provisions we have right now don't meet those needs, especially for individuals who are struggling with high mental health needs.",327,,
1905,0.97,15598.816,15607.892,There is an aspect with all the service provisions out there that we don't have a service provision for that population.,327,,
1906,0.97,15607.892,15615.299,The business owners and community numbers and people that live in tent and cabinets are most concerned about.,327,,
1907,0.97,15615.299,15626.043,And I believe that there could be a package in place but that needs to be intentional.,327,,
1908,0.97,15626.043,15630.548,Otherwise if people are relocating to other places they are least likely going to shelter and for that issue to be resolved.,327,,
1909,0.97,15630.548,15636.654,We will move to other locations and that is a commute 80 as a whole.,327,,
1910,0.97,15636.654,15653.137,"Thank you for your ability to not abandon people outside and trying to provide meaningful relief to the individuals that meets the needs on the concerns for those that are living outside, as well as the community as a whole.",327,,
1911,0.97,15653.137,15659.377,"We really need a third path, not just removing individuals but also not leaving people where they are at.",327,,
1912,0.97,15659.377,15659.777,Thank you.,327,,
1913,0.97,15659.777,15661.379,Thank you so much.,328,,
1914,0.97,15661.379,15667.985,"Next up, and Elizabeth, I don't know how to pronounce your last name.",328,,
1915,0.97,15667.985,15668.753,I am so sorry.,328,,
1916,0.97,15668.753,15672.656,Why don't you tell me.,328,,
1917,0.97,15672.656,15676.894,[Laughter] from the international community health services.,328,,
1918,0.97,15676.894,15678.462,Is my Audio and video working?,329,,
1919,0.97,15678.462,15678.729,Yes.,330,,
1920,0.97,15678.729,15681.399,We can see you.,330,,
1921,0.97,15681.399,15682.166,Fantastic.,331,,
1922,0.97,15682.166,15685.803,I had no idea if it would work because it was on mute for the last four hours.,331,,
1923,0.97,15685.803,15690.274,So thank you for the opportunity 25 to address the community.,331,,
1924,0.97,15690.274,15702.486,"My name is Liz Agee and I apologize for anybody, our Ceo was supposed to be here.",331,,
1925,0.97,15702.486,15711.629,But I Chs once everyone to have a safe and healthy place to live in this pandemic and beyond.,331,,
1926,0.97,15711.629,15728.112,"However we oppose due to the ability of Covid-19 to spread, the Encampments in the Chinatown district were detrimental to the residence and our vulnerable residents, especially the elderly who make up 40% of the neighborhood.",331,,
1927,0.97,15728.112,15754.071,"Covid-19 demands acts such as social distancing, masking, Handwashing and frequent Disinfecting of surfaces as the most Encampments may not be the most safe or healthiest environment and mere physical activity is not itself a risk faster for other Commutable diseases.",331,,
1928,0.97,15754.071,15760.244,With Covid-19 there is no cure or vaccine for a highly transmissible virus with both symptomatic and a some somatic persons.,331,,
1929,0.97,15760.244,15769.72,"Even when the treatments finally exist, the wide availability to low income populations will take time to Disseminate.",331,,
1930,0.97,15769.72,15777.461,Residents of the Chinatown International district are in a frail community struggling to lift itself up in normal times.,331,,
1931,0.97,15777.461,15786.67,"They have been affected by Covid-19, going on for longer than most other areas of Seattle due to increased racism and xenophobia parents by the neighborhood.",331,,
1932,0.97,15786.67,15798.682,"The Chinatown and little Saigon community members and organizations have worked together to support the low income residents, especially the elderly.",331,,
1933,0.97,15798.682,15802.419,We have also worked to assist in educating and protecting the community against the spread of Covid-19.,331,,
1934,0.97,15802.419,15810.227,The small family restaurants and businesses that probably our neighborhood are struggling to come back and need to assure the public that it is a safe and healthy place for customers.,331,,
1935,0.97,15810.227,15824.942,"We hope that the city will help to provide everyone with the safe shelter that they need but during Covid-19, Unsanctioned Encampments, like in the Chinatown International district and little Saigon are detrimental to the public health of everyone.",331,,
1936,0.97,15824.942,15825.342,Thank you.,331,,
1937,0.97,15825.342,15829.346,"Liz, thank you so much for your presentation.",332,,

1939,0.97,15832.65,15833.851,Take it away.,332,,
1940,0.97,15833.851,15834.985,The floor is yours.,332,,
1941,0.97,15834.985,15837.354,Good evening everybody.,333,,
1942,0.97,15837.354,15842.226,Thank you Councilmember Lewis and members of the Council generally.,333,,
1943,0.97,15842.226,15845.663,I am pleased to be here and want to thank you for giving me your time.,333,,
1944,0.97,15845.663,15859.276,"Let me start off by stressing that we are absolutely against the Dehumanizing impact of the Sweeps, for the Encampments.",333,,
1945,0.97,15859.276,15872.69,I want to say that very clearly and also want you to know that I will share a per SPEC if with you that comes from experiencing two of the Encampments that have been rated several times throughout public comment and also throughout both panels.,333,,
1946,0.97,15872.69,15887.104,"On fell Street and Weller, which is in Councilmember Sawant's district, and the encampment that was located between Dearborn and Lane street, below our clinic.",333,,
1947,0.97,15887.104,15891.408,"I want, I felt the same sentiments as everyone else.",333,,
1948,0.97,15891.408,15902.319,Ideally we would have everybody in hotels with their own bathroom and being able to maintain the level of hygiene necessary in order to reduce the infection rate.,333,,
1949,0.97,15902.319,15911.295,You know obviously we are a Healthcare provider and have taken an active approach in addressing the needs to respond to Covid-19 in many very innovative ways.,333,,
1950,0.97,15911.295,15913.43,And very proud of our team for that.,333,,
1951,0.97,15913.43,15917.601,That is why I am wondering why we are not working together.,333,,
1952,0.97,15917.601,15924.875,"The Mayor's office and also city Council, working together to implement innovative approaches.",333,,
1953,0.97,15924.875,15926.911,I am hearing we do not have enough hotels.,333,,
1954,0.97,15926.911,15929.346,That the shelter beds are not as appealing.,333,,
1955,0.97,15929.346,15932.216,To the folks that are living in the Encampments.,333,,
1956,0.97,15932.216,15935.853,Those things are all understandable.,333,,
1957,0.97,15935.853,15939.556,Why are we not trying to do some of the things that we have seen in New York?,333,,
1958,0.97,15939.556,15947.665,"Like why are we not Repurposing Stadiums, for example, to create safe social distance Encampments that have resources like showers and wash stations?",333,,
1959,0.97,15947.665,15948.666,In those types of things?,333,,
1960,0.97,15948.666,15954.772,That is the type of creative thinking I would like to see.,333,,
1961,0.97,15954.772,15968.786,It is one thing to say we should tax Amazon and another thing to have relationships within the businesses within your district to be able to work with them to Repurpose places that are not being used right now.,333,,
1962,0.97,15968.786,15970.587,Because we are actually in more of a shutdown mode.,333,,
1963,0.97,15970.587,15970.988,Right?,333,,
1964,0.97,15970.988,15974.658,So we could Repurpose parking lots in those types of things.,333,,
1965,0.97,15974.658,15981.398,I want to hear that type of creative thinking and not just limited to this idea that if we had more resources we could make it happen.,333,,
1966,0.97,15981.398,15989.273,"The truth is, one of the things that we do really well is come together as a community and share resources.",333,,
1967,0.97,15989.273,15990.774,We work together to make things happen.,333,,
1968,0.97,15990.774,15991.108,You know?,333,,
1969,0.97,15991.108,15999.216,"And I will tell you something, my tribe, Navajo nation, and in Navajo nation, really struggling, you want to know why?",333,,
1970,0.97,15999.216,16001.719,We do not have access to water.,333,,
1971,0.97,16001.719,16008.258,"We don't have access to water and that limits our ability to be able to maintain hygiene standards, reduce the infection.",333,,
1972,0.97,16008.258,16009.393,Right?,333,,
1973,0.97,16009.393,16012.83,"Water, hygiene, Ppe, does that sound familiar to you?",333,,
1974,0.97,16012.83,16018.502,That sounds a lot to me what we have been expensing at 12th and Weller.,333,,
1975,0.97,16018.502,16026.243,The idea that somehow these people who are engaging in criminal activity are not living in the Encampments is absolutely ridiculous.,333,,
1976,0.97,16026.243,16032.95,Let me paint a picture of what it looked like to you when we were at the encampment between Dearborn and Lane street.,333,,
1977,0.97,16032.95,16038.022,We actually stopped three rapes.,333,,
1978,0.97,16038.022,16043.427,We provided containers and we had machetes pulled on us.,333,,
1979,0.97,16043.427,16048.232,We had employees that had Feces thrown on them.,333,,
1980,0.97,16048.232,16048.632,You know?,333,,
1981,0.97,16048.632,16055.873,"We offer services every day and every chance we get to get people into shelter and hotels, our homeless investment team does that.",333,,
1982,0.97,16055.873,16058.942,Our providers do that.,333,,
1983,0.97,16058.942,16060.978,We have had a lot of the successes that Allison shared.,333,,
1984,0.97,16060.978,16063.28,I want you to know there are a lot of successes.,333,,
1985,0.97,16063.28,16065.249,And the challenges are very difficult.,333,,
1986,0.97,16065.249,16074.591,"We, during that time, when the encampment was there, we had Overdoses at least once a week in the bathrooms.",333,,
1987,0.97,16074.591,16078.195,Our medical team saved people's lives.,333,,
1988,0.97,16078.195,16080.264,That is what it looked like.,333,,
1989,0.97,16080.264,16080.697,Right?,333,,
1990,0.97,16080.697,16085.402,"The encampment on 12th and Weller, we watched drug deals happen.",333,,
1991,0.97,16085.402,16088.572,"There were several shootings, several shootings at Dearborn.",333,,
1992,0.97,16088.572,16091.408,"We witnessed those, we stopped them.",333,,
1993,0.97,16091.408,16096.313,We tried to offer services and try to get people resources they need.,333,,
1994,0.97,16096.313,16099.383,That is what it looked like.,333,,
1995,0.97,16099.383,16104.455,"We have had our building broken into four times, we have had to invest $200,000 in increased security.",333,,
1996,0.97,16104.455,16109.693,We have had to do repairs . We have had to add hazardous-waste cleanup twice a day.,333,,
1997,0.97,16109.693,16110.694,Right?,333,,
1998,0.97,16110.694,16120.737,We have had to do all of those things with no investment from the city or County and really supporting us with those efforts.,333,,
1999,0.97,16120.737,16127.811,"So what happens is the burden is transferred onto organizations like ours, which we are happy to hold because these people we love and they are our relatives that we serve.",333,,
2000,0.97,16127.811,16129.847,When they allow us to serve we do it well.,333,,
2001,0.97,16129.847,16132.749,But we are not getting any help.,333,,
2002,0.97,16132.749,16142.426,"The other thing I am seeing is that our capacity for support services, like the mobile wash stations, or the mobile showers, those types of things, are really limited.",333,,
2003,0.97,16142.426,16144.261,And King County is doing the best they can.,333,,
2004,0.97,16144.261,16148.131,There is no coordinated effort with Covid-19.,333,,
2005,0.97,16148.131,16156.073,Everybody is doing this work independently and we are not doing it together.,333,,
2006,0.97,16156.073,16161.345,"So we are left with scarcity of resources, and no effort to gather to solve these problems.",333,,
2007,0.97,16161.345,16163.147,So that is where I am coming from.,333,,
2008,0.97,16163.147,16177.995,"And instead of De-Funding the navigation team, I would like to see the navigation team Repurposed into truly pilot a community policing model, a real community policing model grounded in behavioral health.",333,,
2009,0.97,16177.995,16180.464,"That is very different, very different than what we are doing.",333,,
2010,0.97,16180.464,16185.369,It sounds a lot like what we are trying to do but why don't we do it together?,333,,
2011,0.97,16185.369,16188.906,It will still take resources to make that happen.,333,,
2012,0.97,16188.906,16192.876,And still we are going to have to address the criminal activity as well.,333,,
2013,0.97,16192.876,16195.913,So I want to be very clear that it is not black and white.,333,,
2014,0.97,16195.913,16197.281,It is not one or the other.,333,,
2015,0.97,16197.281,16199.349,We have to address the entire problem.,333,,
2016,0.97,16199.349,16201.318,"And yes, I am leaning on you.",333,,
2017,0.97,16201.318,16208.625,You all are beautiful brilliant lawyers and policy folks and can solve a complex problem as a collective.,333,,
2018,0.97,16208.625,16208.892,You can.,333,,
2019,0.97,16208.892,16215.732,"I can give you ideas but you have the power, you have the authority, you have the resources.",333,,
2020,0.97,16215.732,16221.104,And that is why I am grateful to have this time right now to share that with you.,333,,
2021,0.97,16221.104,16224.074,And I want you to know we are good neighbors and doing our part.,333,,
2022,0.97,16224.074,16225.342,We are doing our part.,333,,
2023,0.97,16225.342,16227.945,So thank you.,333,,
2024,0.97,16227.945,16228.946,Thank you so much.,334,,
2025,0.97,16228.946,16238.922,We look forward to taking advantage of your expertise when we flip the script in a moment here and start asking questions.,334,,
2026,0.97,16238.922,16241.024,Before that we have one last presenter.,334,,
2027,0.97,16241.024,16241.758,Lisa Howard.,334,,
2028,0.97,16241.758,16250.534,"From my district and Councilmember Morales' district, Lisa, take away.",334,,
2029,0.97,16250.534,16253.136,"Okay, thanks for having me.",335,,
2030,0.97,16253.136,16268.885,"So as Councilmember Lewis said, my name is Lisa Howard, I am the executive director and I wanted to share some Contextual information about pioneers first experience of the residents and small business owners.",335,,
2031,0.97,16268.885,16274.691,And the impact of the large sanctions that the encampment is having on the neighborhood now.,335,,
2032,0.97,16274.691,16279.563,I know you are all familiar with Pioneer square but I want to share some information you may not have heard.,335,,
2033,0.97,16279.563,16283.6,Pioneer square was a complex environment before Covid-19 hit the city.,335,,
2034,0.97,16283.6,16284.668,It is even more true today.,335,,
2035,0.97,16284.668,16293.777,"We have a relatively low residential population with, compared to other neighborhoods with an estimated 3000 residents.",335,,
2036,0.97,16293.777,16296.68,About 60% of whom are at or below 30% AMI.,335,,
2037,0.97,16296.68,16305.722,In addition we have many human service providers in the District serving between 1500 and 2000 individuals emergency or long-term shelter.,335,,
2038,0.97,16305.722,16308.625,The variance is due to Seasonality.,335,,
2039,0.97,16308.625,16313.03,Many providers serve people with the most complex cases.,335,,
2040,0.97,16313.03,16318.402,In addition over 850 businesses in Pioneer square call it home with over 200 of those at retail level.,335,,
2041,0.97,16318.402,16323.84,I am hearing daily from constituents about the crisis on our streets.,335,,
2042,0.97,16323.84,16337.854,"To be explicit, the residents and the businesses of Piner square have Coexisted with people expensing homelessness far longer than you and I. most of them are solution oriented and want Teeple matched with the solutions they need.",335,,
2043,0.97,16337.854,16348.832,The major concerns right now are the concerns of being able to separate dangerous criminal behavior from those experiencing homelessness in these large Encampments.,335,,
2044,0.97,16348.832,16360.377,"Some things I have heard regarding the current environment, there has been three instances of shots fired, it has been reported that there has been sex trafficking reported with a number of individuals.",335,,
2045,0.97,16360.377,16367.484,Human Feces on the street and surrounding area due to the lack of hygiene centers and bathroom availability.,335,,
2046,0.97,16367.484,16387.604,"The surrounding services have Úreported additional challenges due to the negative and criminal activity affecting their daily operations, including violence in the line for service access, lack of social distancing, especially at the fountain on Fontaine and also the ability to access outdoor space.",335,,
2047,0.97,16387.604,16393.31,Due to the lack of social distancing.,335,,
2048,0.97,16393.31,16400.884,A resident Emailed in and reported she was going on her daily walk and a person from the encampment ran up to her and screamed Covid-19 in her face and then proceeded to cough on her.,335,,
2049,0.97,16400.884,16413.263,"She also observed a gentleman passed out in a wheelchair in the middle of second Avenue extension, almost hit by three cars until she went out and moved him herself.",335,,
2050,0.97,16413.263,16417.601,Businesses are also feeling acute impact right now.,335,,
2051,0.97,16417.601,16434.751,"A business directly up the street from the encampment, about two months ago, had extensive damage throughout his store as it was ransacked by someone with extensive criminal history with a four foot tree limb.",335,,
2052,0.97,16434.751,16444.06,Currently the owner is trying to reopen and has had over $900.00 worth of damage to his front door from the attempted burglary.,335,,
2053,0.97,16444.06,16447.531,He has been told repeatedly that there is no options for him to remove the individuals.,335,,
2054,0.97,16447.531,16450.367,In front of his business.,335,,
2055,0.97,16450.367,16458.675,"A second business has also been facing extreme hardship, especially during the pandemic.",335,,
2056,0.97,16458.675,16472.589,He was Burglarized in late March with equipment and food stolen from his brick and mortar and also from his food truck.,335,,
2057,0.97,16472.589,16482.699,There been people Defecating in front of his front door daily and also people reaching into the restaurant and stealing things including generators and food.,335,,
2058,0.97,16482.699,16484.968,This neighborhood is special because we are welcoming to all.,335,,
2059,0.97,16484.968,16486.57,But it is Off-Balance and things are not working.,335,,
2060,0.97,16486.57,16491.408,Vulnerable small businesses are trying to navigate new business models while having to navigate an unsafe environment.,335,,
2061,0.97,16491.408,16500.116,The intensity of the impact of Unsanctioned Encampments is such that is negatively Impacting our ability to function in almost every aspect.,335,,
2062,0.97,16500.116,16503.086,And the people on the street are not getting the help they need.,335,,
2063,0.97,16503.086,16508.225,Public safety concerns are real and worth your attention.,335,,
2064,0.97,16508.225,16510.193,This challenge has unnecessarily escalated to crisis level.,335,,
2065,0.97,16510.193,16515.799,"We need information, sorry, we need interventions months ago.",335,,
2066,0.97,16515.799,16521.338,And we are asking for cooperation within various arms of government now.,335,,
2067,0.97,16521.338,16527.344,Ignoring the severity of the encampment on second Avenue extension is wrong.,335,,
2068,0.97,16527.344,16529.212,It sends the message that everyone loses here.,335,,
2069,0.97,16529.212,16531.448,Removing tools is not the answer to this complex problem.,335,,
2070,0.97,16531.448,16533.35,We have to do better moving forward.,335,,
2071,0.97,16533.35,16539.756,It would be significantly easier if we were solving one problem or for one publisher but we are.,335,,
2072,0.97,16539.756,16541.024,Thank you for having me today.,335,,
2073,0.97,16541.024,16542.859,I'm happy to answer any questions.,335,,
2074,0.97,16542.859,16547.731,Thank you so much for joining us.,336,,
2075,0.97,16547.731,16551.868,Now I will open it up to questions.,336,,
2076,0.97,16551.868,16552.369,From Councilmembers.,336,,
2077,0.97,16552.369,16558.575,And questions at this point can be posed to any member of the panel.,336,,
2078,0.97,16558.575,16562.879,"So, who wants to go first?",336,,
2079,0.97,16562.879,16568.084,Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Mosqueda.,336,,
2080,0.97,16568.084,16568.785,Thank you.,337,,
2081,0.97,16568.785,16572.222,Not a question but a recognition of the work that Jessica has been doing.,337,,
2082,0.97,16572.222,16573.456,As she described it.,337,,
2083,0.97,16573.456,16577.394,Really conforms with the vision that I have held for a very long time.,337,,
2084,0.97,16577.394,16581.264,For the kind of work that the navigation team should be doing.,337,,
2085,0.97,16581.264,16593.31,They should be informing encampment Sidents of what the expectations are and working with them to provide them the technical assistance and resources to meet the expectations.,337,,
2086,0.97,16593.31,16602.886,And I really appreciate that she has been initiating that approach to her work.,337,,
2087,0.97,16602.886,16626.543,"And I am sorrowful that the information that you have provided residents that you have engaged with about the city's encampment Removals, might have resulted in a lack of, not a lack of trust but a failing of trust with the people you are working to create relationships with.",337,,
2088,0.97,16626.543,16635.418,In the city did not really hold its commitment to Seizing the encampment Removals.,337,,
2089,0.97,16635.418,16658.942,"So again I really look forward to working more closely with folks like you who are on the ground, who know what kind of inducements and enticements and the resources that people need to sort of adhere to the rules of the road once we have an agreement on what the rules are.",337,,
2090,0.97,16658.942,16661.344,Thank you.,338,,
2091,0.97,16661.344,16679.896,"And Councilmember Herbold, before moving to the next question, I did want to say that I believe that Esther has another comment that she wanted to make from her presentation.",338,,
2092,0.97,16679.896,16684.134,"And Esther, if you want to do that now, it might be the best time to do it.",338,,
2093,0.97,16684.134,16689.606,And Councilmember Lewis can you add me to the list?,339,,
2094,0.97,16689.606,16690.473,Yes.,340,,
2095,0.97,16690.473,16690.907,Thank you.,340,,
2096,0.97,16690.907,16691.674,Thank you.,341,,
2097,0.97,16691.674,16692.308,I appreciate it.,341,,
2098,0.97,16692.308,16696.913,I got so fired up that I forgot to say what I wanted to see the navigation team do.,341,,
2099,0.97,16696.913,16705.622,"In order to address the gaps in capacity, we really want to see Mo you's truly establish with communities like ours.",341,,
2100,0.97,16705.622,16713.329,"If we all get together as a collective effort, we will be more successful.",341,,
2101,0.97,16713.329,16715.198,"I will tell you, we have not had that.",341,,
2102,0.97,16715.198,16724.14,We do not have a Mou with the navigation team working County.,341,,
2103,0.97,16724.14,16731.514,"That is exactly what I'm talking about, a true community policing model Leverages the community strengths in order to support a need.",341,,
2104,0.97,16731.514,16741.157,"The other thing I want to point out is that the two Sweeps that I spoke about, neither of them would have been protect it through this bill.",341,,
2105,0.97,16741.157,16742.692,So let's be very clear about that.,341,,
2106,0.97,16742.692,16752.969,Is of the criminal activity that is defined through the clerk file.,341,,
2107,0.97,16752.969,16753.77,Okay.,342,,
2108,0.97,16753.77,16761.678,Thank you.,342,,
2109,0.97,16761.678,16764.214,Councilmember Mosqueda is the next person on my list to asked the question.,342,,
2110,0.97,16764.214,16765.782,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,343,,
2111,0.97,16765.782,16771.654,I want to thank the second panel for your participation and engagement with us on the long discussion today.,343,,
2112,0.97,16771.654,16782.699,"I think that the Speaker from the Bia, Ms. Howard, thank you for sharing your comments especially noting that you need a cooperation months ago.",343,,
2113,0.97,16782.699,16783.199,I agree.,343,,
2114,0.97,16783.199,16788.605,I think there is a lot more we could have done months ago in an effort to be more coordinated.,343,,
2115,0.97,16788.605,16793.076,I think that is a very should fair criticism of the city as a whole.,343,,
2116,0.97,16793.076,16795.478,And I also believe with MS.,343,,
2117,0.97,16795.478,16803.586,"Lucero, thank you for your presentation, powerful words and your directive for us to work through a more automated approach.",343,,
2118,0.97,16803.586,16818.201,"I think folks are expressing a level of frustration that we are in this position and I think it is not fair, it is not fair to organizations that provide health services on the ground level, that you have to shoulder the brunt of it.",343,,
2119,0.97,16818.201,16826.743,It is not fair to the small businesses that are being asked to get ready to consider opening and having folks potentially living outside on their doorstep.,343,,
2120,0.97,16826.743,16840.156,And it is not fair to the individuals who have been Lving on shelter to not have the sanitation and health services they need in order to be healthy and be off the street and out of harms way.,343,,
2121,0.97,16840.156,16845.628,There are a lot of folks out there that are trying to survive and other folks out there that we know are capitalizing on people living outside.,343,,
2122,0.97,16845.628,16849.365,We have got to stop that on all fronts.,343,,
2123,0.97,16849.365,16852.569,I agree with the comments that were made.,343,,
2124,0.97,16852.569,16866.382,"I also think that your plea to us, to do this through a more Resourced driven approach is well-received, as you heard me say on the previous panel I have been trying to get additional resources for individual rooms.",343,,
2125,0.97,16866.382,16880.964,"I have been running into a number of obstacles and I think that your panel today is help to illuminate why it is so critical that we potentially use that resource, that is at our fingertips and ready to go.",343,,
2126,0.97,16880.964,16889.405,"That has a side benefit of helping some small hotels that could get $75.00, $95.00, for a room.",343,,
2127,0.97,16889.405,16893.91,That can help keep them afloat for a while.,343,,
2128,0.97,16893.91,16897.213,It is critical we have the right staffing capacity to get folks into those safe places.,343,,
2129,0.97,16897.213,16902.085,And then to use Co-Lead for the individuals that are problematic or creating safety concerns.,343,,
2130,0.97,16902.085,16908.191,"I think that type of coordinated approach, that was clearly described by Ms. Moss and MS.",343,,
2131,0.97,16908.191,16913.93,"Quan, I think really that is really a helpful directive for us today.",343,,
2132,0.97,16913.93,16914.697,So I do hear you.,343,,
2133,0.97,16914.697,16931.347,"And I just want to double check, if anybody has any additional comments about either additional motel or hotel rooms you heard director Hayes being about a large tent that she has seen in other cities.",343,,
2134,0.97,16931.347,16939.055,"We think about safe places to be in the conjugate settings that we heard earlier, actually creating a public health risk.",343,,
2135,0.97,16939.055,16942.525,And wanting people to have a safe place it's we don't have the appropriate housing right now.,343,,
2136,0.97,16942.525,16954.47,"If you have other thoughts about what type of housing alternatives you would like to see us Collaboratively work on, would be really helpful.",343,,
2137,0.97,16954.47,16958.975,I will stop there.,343,,
2138,0.97,16962.779,16964.781,And who wants to take on that question first?,344,,
2139,0.97,16964.781,16968.685,I will speak briefly.,345,,
2140,0.97,16968.685,16976.192,"Councilmember Mosqueda, I think you and I have spoken and there are not really too many variations on the theme.",345,,
2141,0.97,16976.192,16982.198,[Laughter] of ensuring that we have safer places for people to be.,345,,
2142,0.97,16982.198,16990.673,But I think the lesson of Covid- 19 is we need all of the options before us.,345,,
2143,0.97,16990.673,17001.317,"And, to Esther's point, we need to take a coordinated, collaborative approach, to Prioritizing folks and matching them well.",345,,
2144,0.97,17001.317,17020.737,"One of the things that I think is most painful as I hear people who are outreach workers and Healthcare professionals in the field, talk about the realities of trying to help people without shelter in this crisis.",345,,
2145,0.97,17020.737,17024.307,"Is that, you know, they know what people find helpful and useful.",345,,
2146,0.97,17024.307,17035.852,"And that includes depending on the person, hotel or motel rooms, a tiny house, enhanced or 24/7 shelter.",345,,
2147,0.97,17035.852,17041.057,There are a wide range of things that work well for people.,345,,
2148,0.97,17041.057,17042.625,We do not have enough of them.,345,,
2149,0.97,17042.625,17054.037,And the other thing that I think is really important for the Council to understand is that right now the navigation team is the Gatekeeper.,345,,
2150,0.97,17054.037,17060.91,"For access to hundreds of available, safer places for people to be indoors.",345,,
2151,0.97,17060.91,17068.684,And that is not rational or effective deployment of our limited resources.,345,,
2152,0.97,17068.684,17073.356,"I also think our colleges and universities need to be tapped, dormitory rooms are a real option.",345,,
2153,0.97,17073.356,17086.702,"And I think that it is appropriate to have some conversations about what it is going to take for smaller, more spread out congregate settings to work.",345,,
2154,0.97,17086.702,17087.303,And for whom.,345,,
2155,0.97,17087.303,17092.475,"I think it will take additional resources, I know it will take additional staffing.",345,,
2156,0.97,17092.475,17099.315,It will also take additional physical new spaces for shelters to exist in.,345,,
2157,0.97,17099.315,17120.036,"And I think other communities, including Los Angeles, have seized the opportunity to say, we can both support locally owned hotel and motel businesses, and we can give employment opportunities to people who have lost their jobs.",345,,
2158,0.97,17120.036,17131.447,And we can figure out ways to scale up and Prioritize people that mean that we are making progress every single week.,345,,
2159,0.97,17131.447,17145.828,"Los Angeles, homelessness authority, their central authority just announced that they are going to attempt to create 15,000 hotel and motel rooms.",345,,
2160,0.97,17145.828,17153.269,"And that is, as I understand it, over and above 15,000 spaces that governor Newsom pledged statewide in California.",345,,
2161,0.97,17153.269,17160.476,"So, I think there is a lot more than we can do and we need to do it fast.",345,,
2162,0.97,17160.476,17163.379,Because we are lucky with the weather right now and that will not last.,345,,
2163,0.97,17163.379,17165.781,"Allison, thank you for that.",346,,
2164,0.97,17165.781,17167.85,I have a related question I wanted to ask quickly.,346,,
2165,0.97,17167.85,17181.063,"And then we have Councilmember Sawant, and Councilmember Herbold, and anyone else that wants to get into the Queue, please Email.",346,,
2166,0.97,17181.063,17190.306,This is related and I want to ask it now but want to direct it to Jessica who talked earlier about some of her outreach work and the offering a placement.,346,,
2167,0.97,17190.306,17219.936,"I just want to Jessica, and her personal experience, because I have heard this Anecdotally but I wanted as someone who has been in the field, I have heard that like the tiny House placements in particular, are very desirable places from people that receive offers of shelter over traditional conjugate shelters.",346,,
2168,0.97,17219.936,17224.907,Also about hotel replacement being desirable.,346,,
2169,0.97,17224.907,17240.556,"Jessica, on a Relatable question that we were talking about, kind of different shelter offerings, from your experience, with folks that you do outreach with, relay as a feedback to you the kind of shelter they are interested in?",346,,
2170,0.97,17240.556,17248.364,"Well, before hotels were an option, the tiny homes.",347,,
2171,0.97,17248.364,17252.535,"Right away, tiny homes, the navigation center, the bridge.",347,,
2172,0.97,17252.535,17255.938,"Now hotels and motels, like a high of golden ticket.",347,,
2173,0.97,17255.938,17258.274,Like people would love that.,347,,
2174,0.97,17258.274,17261.344,"And, Yeah, people after that.",347,,
2175,0.97,17261.344,17262.979,All the time.,347,,
2176,0.97,17262.979,17265.281,Everybody.,347,,
2177,0.97,17265.281,17269.585,"And what I have to tell them is it is minimal, very scarce.",347,,
2178,0.97,17269.585,17272.188,There is none today.,347,,
2179,0.97,17272.188,17272.989,There is one today.,347,,
2180,0.97,17272.989,17274.29,Or there is two today.,347,,
2181,0.97,17274.29,17290.506,"And what happens, but when more tiny houses came Online, at the navigation staircase removal, that was, that was, I feel like a lot of people to close right away.",347,,
2182,0.97,17290.506,17297.113,And I will not be surprised if the beds that were available were tiny homes.,347,,
2183,0.97,17297.113,17303.019,"But after about one week, or two, like all the new tiny homes were filled.",347,,
2184,0.97,17303.019,17305.221,I would say probably sooner than that.,347,,
2185,0.97,17305.221,17310.693,The shelter beds are debated amongst everybody in Seattle.,347,,
2186,0.97,17310.693,17314.23,In between all providers.,347,,
2187,0.97,17314.23,17330.046,"So, I would, just like for information purposes, I suggest that all Councilmembers look into what the shelter process is actually like.",347,,
2188,0.97,17330.046,17333.149,And how smooth or Un-Smooth that actually goes.,347,,
2189,0.97,17333.149,17339.955,And how the shelter beds are allocated to people who want them.,347,,
2190,0.97,17339.955,17347.363,"Because, it is, it could be better.",347,,
2191,0.97,17347.363,17347.963,A lot better.,347,,
2192,0.97,17347.963,17348.564,Okay Jessica.,348,,
2193,0.97,17348.564,17351.267,Thank you for answering that question.,348,,
2194,0.97,17351.267,17352.968,"Councilmember Sawant, your quest in.",348,,
2195,0.97,17352.968,17356.072,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,349,,
2196,0.97,17356.072,17360.776,"My question, as I said before, about specifics.",349,,
2197,0.97,17360.776,17365.848,I actually appreciate some of the speakers in this panel already giving specifics.,349,,
2198,0.97,17365.848,17368.484,But I wanted to see if we can get more information on that.,349,,
2199,0.97,17368.484,17378.694,"Also, if we can make a request from, my question is directly to Jessica and Tara.",349,,
2200,0.97,17378.694,17382.898,If they could send some information that they articulated verbally.,349,,
2201,0.97,17382.898,17385.167,Something in writing that they could send the council as well.,349,,
2202,0.97,17385.167,17388.204,Then we can look it over carefully.,349,,
2203,0.97,17388.204,17403.185,"I really appreciate Allison and others saying that we need all the options to be made available, including hotel and motel rooms, affordable housing, tiny House villages.",349,,
2204,0.97,17403.185,17403.819,It is a pandemic.,349,,
2205,0.97,17403.819,17405.888,We have to put human beings and human lives first.,349,,
2206,0.97,17405.888,17407.823,We always have to do that but especially now.,349,,
2207,0.97,17407.823,17416.399,"My questions were, again, I have asked them of the previous panel but I think Jessica, Allison and Tara are in a better position to answer the questions.",349,,
2208,0.97,17416.399,17430.446,"We heard from the Mayor representatives that, I believe that this is very, almost exact speech, removal after weeks of engagement and shelter referrals.",349,,
2209,0.97,17430.446,17436.352,Let us know from your experience what is it that the homeless neighbors experienced?,349,,
2210,0.97,17436.352,17438.521,In terms of what type of engagement?,349,,
2211,0.97,17438.521,17439.522,And what type of referrals?,349,,
2212,0.97,17439.522,17445.361,"We keep hearing the generic statement that those who accepted what we offered, we know about them.",349,,
2213,0.97,17445.361,17455.437,Implying that the good offers were made and the others did not accept it for strange reasons that are incomprehensible to us that our house.,349,,
2214,0.97,17455.437,17468.384,"I think it is really important what Jessica said, and also Tara, that it is important that the, what is offered is concurrent to what people are looking for.",349,,
2215,0.97,17468.384,17469.185,Because these are human beings.,349,,
2216,0.97,17469.185,17470.252,For some details.,349,,
2217,0.97,17470.252,17481.997,"And also, this is a question I asked the earlier panel, where have the residents of the recent Sweeps gone?",349,,
2218,0.97,17481.997,17483.199,Is reach able to track that?,349,,
2219,0.97,17483.199,17485.067,I know that you have some resources.,349,,
2220,0.97,17485.067,17487.47,And what has happened after many of the Sweeps?,349,,
2221,0.97,17487.47,17492.374,"And I don't want you to restrict your answers, just what is happening during the pandemic.",349,,
2222,0.97,17492.374,17492.808,But in general.,349,,
2223,0.97,17492.808,17501.317,"You all have been on the ground for years on this, overall what is your assessment of what has happened after each suite?",349,,
2224,0.97,17501.317,17503.886,"What has happened after the jungle sweep, for example.",349,,
2225,0.97,17503.886,17509.024,After what chief best was saying motivated by crime.,349,,
2226,0.97,17509.024,17512.328,Which of course I shared but what about the homeless neighbors?,349,,
2227,0.97,17512.328,17528.711,"What do we know and not know about the people who were swept mark and then, in addition to those questions I would just NOTE it is quite unfortunate that we have had two panels but not one person who has actually experienced a sweep.",349,,
2228,0.97,17528.711,17532.948,A homeless neighbor who has experienced a sweep on either panel.,349,,
2229,0.97,17532.948,17544.56,We had representatives from the business improvement area and the Mayor's office but nobody from real change or a tiny House village residents.,349,,
2230,0.97,17544.56,17550.432,Business owners are free to talk about how to fix them but I do not think that they are the ones to be asked about what homeless people need.,349,,
2231,0.97,17550.432,17556.539,I want it to be noted that I think this discussion would be better informed by somebody who is actually experiencing the Sweeps and what their view is.,349,,
2232,0.97,17556.539,17557.339,Thank you.,349,,
2233,0.97,17557.339,17560.175,Thank you.,350,,
2234,0.97,17560.175,17565.347,"Allison, do you want to respond to that question first?",350,,
2235,0.97,17565.347,17576.692,"Well, I heard several questions from Councilmember Sawant, and I will maybe try to say what I can speak to.",351,,
2236,0.97,17576.692,17582.898,And obviously Jessica has the most direct professional experience.,351,,
2237,0.97,17582.898,17597.012,"As I said, I did ask a number of Healthcare professionals and outreach workers in preparation of the evening, to tell me what they knew.",351,,
2238,0.97,17597.012,17598.881,And I shared some of these experiences with you.,351,,
2239,0.97,17598.881,17610.826,"And I think the reality is, as I hope every Councilmember understands, there are people who have been swept multiple times.",351,,
2240,0.97,17610.826,17615.197,Whose lives have been disrupted multiple times.,351,,
2241,0.97,17615.197,17616.832,Not made better.,351,,
2242,0.97,17616.832,17642.057,"And, I, you know I venture to say that at the heart of this is understanding what it takes to do the kind of skilled outreach work at the level of the reach team or the--team that specializes in serving people with particularly serious mental health disorders.",351,,
2243,0.97,17642.057,17643.659,Is time.,351,,
2244,0.97,17643.659,17645.361,Trust.,351,,
2245,0.97,17645.361,17646.662,Relationship.,351,,
2246,0.97,17646.662,17648.43,And skill.,351,,
2247,0.97,17648.43,17652.434,"And of course, the resources to offer people.",351,,
2248,0.97,17652.434,17655.571,I mean it is not new to offer people without shelter a hotel room.,351,,
2249,0.97,17655.571,17675.19,"What is new is that there is now a public health crisis that has Councilmember Mosqueda said, allows for at the moment 75% of the cost of a hotel room to be covered for a large portion of people through FEMA dollars.",351,,
2250,0.97,17675.19,17693.909,"What is new is that people are understanding the extent to which it is possible to both help respond to the kinds of concerns that Lisa Howard described in that Esther Lucero described, and respond to the needs of the people who are homeless, by actually giving people somewhere stable and better to be.",351,,
2251,0.97,17693.909,17713.429,"And there are a number of the executive directors of my member organizations observed to me that what their staff repeatedly tell them, the staff that provide skilled outreach in the community, is that many of the people they interact with have been Peter Lee traumatized.",351,,
2252,0.97,17713.429,17717.199,And it becomes more difficult to engage with those folks.,351,,
2253,0.97,17717.199,17723.305,It becomes more difficult to persuade people that there is something useful.,351,,
2254,0.97,17723.305,17727.476,[Laughter] that staff have to offer.,351,,
2255,0.97,17727.476,17745.327,"So, where people go, it sometimes is one of the people that responded to me said, this is a masters level nurse, part of a team, told me that they had found people who had just gone deeper and deeper into the woods.",351,,
2256,0.97,17745.327,17753.969,They had lost their medication in the last sweep and therefore there was somebody with diabetes not getting insulin.,351,,
2257,0.97,17753.969,17756.872,"And you know, what happens is not good.",351,,
2258,0.97,17756.872,17758.974,But it does not have to be that way.,351,,
2259,0.97,17758.974,17775.991,"I just want to, I am so sorry Councilmember Sawant, I did not retain all of the questions that you grouped together but I think that we can talk a lot about the harm being done, and I feel sadly as though we have done that with little result.",351,,
2260,0.97,17775.991,17800.816,"And what I would like to hope we can do in the time that we continue to have this lengthy meeting, is to identify the ways that the Council can ensure that we are not depriving Seattle residents of a safer place to be.",351,,
2261,0.97,17800.816,17807.022,"But instead, listening to what they are already telling us and saying how will we make that happen?",351,,
2262,0.97,17807.022,17808.69,I thought Esther's point was a fantastic one.,351,,
2263,0.97,17808.69,17817.9,We have creative album solving people throughout city government and throughout Community-Based organizations.,351,,
2264,0.97,17817.9,17832.714,"We can and should do a lot to make things better, and that will help the people that live and work in Pioneer square, in the Chinatown International district, and all over this community.",351,,
2265,0.97,17832.714,17853.135,"And instead, the effect is that essentially, while focusing on something that is important, we have not seen any focused resource response that draws on the community knowledge that would actually respond to the complaints that you are hearing.",351,,
2266,0.97,17853.135,17861.877,"Whether they are from business owners, community residents, or people who themselves are homeless.",351,,
2267,0.97,17861.877,17864.546,"Allison, thank you for that response.",352,,
2268,0.97,17864.546,17873.589,"Jessica, do you want to jump in on Councilmember Sawant's comments as well?",352,,
2269,0.97,17873.589,17874.856,Definitely.,353,,
2270,0.97,17874.856,17886.001,"The reason why people want hotels, or a tiny house, of course is because people have free will and privacy.",353,,
2271,0.97,17886.001,17888.003,And people have their own space.,353,,
2272,0.97,17888.003,17891.907,It is really hard for people to go into shelters with a lot of people.,353,,
2273,0.97,17891.907,17897.813,And a tight space.,353,,
2274,0.97,17897.813,17918.033,"Mood shelters, most shelters have part time mental health or substitute . The people want navigation center because it is low barrier and they are not Criminalized for their substance use.",353,,
2275,0.97,17918.033,17923.605,"That is why I hear from a lot of people, they will not get Criminalized, from their substance use.",353,,
2276,0.97,17923.605,17928.911,A lot of people that camp out there is because they are hoping to get referrals into the NAB center.,353,,
2277,0.97,17928.911,17937.653,Also they are really flexible about moving beds and moving people if they are in a relationship in a couple.,353,,
2278,0.97,17937.653,17940.455,Couples can stay together at the NAV center.,353,,
2279,0.97,17940.455,17942.958,People can stay together at the bridge or tiny houses.,353,,
2280,0.97,17942.958,17944.926,And pets are allowed.,353,,
2281,0.97,17944.926,17945.727,And motels.,353,,
2282,0.97,17945.727,17948.563,Of course.,353,,
2283,0.97,17948.563,17949.231,And hotels.,353,,
2284,0.97,17949.231,17963.679,"And so, the other shelters, it is either a mat on a floor, a tight space, a lot of people, not a lot of substance abuse or mental health service or no resources.",353,,
2285,0.97,17963.679,17968.684,"City Hall and you know, there are a lot of shelters who, it is just for overnight.",353,,
2286,0.97,17968.684,17973.789,You have to be there at a certain time and wait in line for one hour or more to get in.,353,,
2287,0.97,17973.789,17976.191,There is also the possibility that there will not be enough beds.,353,,
2288,0.97,17976.191,17980.762,That actually happen is someone who called me yesterday.,353,,
2289,0.97,17980.762,17983.365,"He did not make it, he did not make it to city hall.",353,,
2290,0.97,17983.365,17986.101,Because there were not enough available beds.,353,,
2291,0.97,17986.101,17988.603,"No, this was two days ago.",353,,
2292,0.97,17988.603,18000.015,"He got out of quarantine, he was trying to go to city hall to sleep there and they were full.",353,,
2293,0.97,18000.015,18002.05,And he wanted a place to shower and do laundry.,353,,
2294,0.97,18002.05,18008.991,"I said Okay, the best thing that I can do is put in a referral for the 24-hour shelter.",353,,
2295,0.97,18008.991,18013.228,You will not know until a few hours later.,353,,
2296,0.97,18013.228,18019.601,In a few hours go by and he calls me . I told him that I still had not heard yet.,353,,
2297,0.97,18019.601,18020.702,Let me follow up.,353,,
2298,0.97,18020.702,18027.042,"The navigators are the only people that are in control, the navigation team is in control of all 24 hours shelters.",353,,
2299,0.97,18027.042,18033.348,So all referrals from all providers in Seattle have to go through them first.,353,,
2300,0.97,18033.348,18039.855,"They dictate, they have to figure out how to allocate them I need, or by who comes first and all that stuff.",353,,
2301,0.97,18039.855,18053.969,"And so, so, the person at reached a point has to send a text saying, who is or have you heard anything back yet?",353,,
2302,0.97,18053.969,18059.775,Then the navigator has to connect with the shelters and that process is a pain in the butt sometimes.,353,,
2303,0.97,18059.775,18064.78,And you cannot contact them and all that stuff.,353,,
2304,0.97,18064.78,18065.347,It is person-to-person.,353,,
2305,0.97,18065.347,18074.756,"Finally I get a response back saying, of course we all care.",353,,
2306,0.97,18074.756,18077.459,"But, I get a response saying sorry, no more 24 hour shelter beds left.",353,,
2307,0.97,18077.459,18079.061,So then I have to let them know.,353,,
2308,0.97,18079.061,18081.596,Can you try to go to city hall earlier tonight and stay there?,353,,
2309,0.97,18081.596,18083.498,Call me tomorrow morning and let's try again.,353,,
2310,0.97,18083.498,18085.1,He called me at 8:15 A.M.,353,,
2311,0.97,18085.1,18086.701,This morning.,353,,
2312,0.97,18086.701,18090.172,I told him that I won't know for a few hours but call me at noon.,353,,
2313,0.97,18090.172,18096.511,He called me at 12:30 and I still had not received a response.,353,,
2314,0.97,18096.511,18099.114,So I had to let him know that I still do not know.,353,,
2315,0.97,18099.114,18100.816,The whole process for that person is Traumatizing.,353,,
2316,0.97,18100.816,18101.416,It is frustrating.,353,,
2317,0.97,18101.416,18106.421,"And for someone who has gone through this multiple times, it is kind of like throwing my hands up in the air.",353,,
2318,0.97,18106.421,18112.727,"And if there is mental health or substance abuse along with it, it is like throwing my feet up along with it.",353,,
2319,0.97,18112.727,18121.036,As soon as this process is over I'm going off the grid and doing my own thing because people clearly do not care.,353,,
2320,0.97,18121.036,18127.142,"So at 2:00 I was able, I was informed he did get into the 24- hour enhanced bed.",353,,
2321,0.97,18127.142,18131.813,Keep in mind this is somebody who Luckily and Thankfully has a phone.,353,,
2322,0.97,18131.813,18144.226,"On outreach when I meet someone from 8:00 until 10:00, and I plan there shelter role, they don't have a phone and I have no way to contact them.",353,,
2323,0.97,18144.226,18146.228,They have to be at the shelter by 4:00 P.M.,353,,
2324,0.97,18146.228,18147.462,I have no way to reach them.,353,,
2325,0.97,18147.462,18151.266,If I go back looking for them and they are not there to make this the Shelterreferral.,353,,
2326,0.97,18151.266,18153.335,But in the city that is counted as accepted.,353,,
2327,0.97,18153.335,18161.343,"And so it is very unfair, it is the way it is Pretrade, very inaccurate.",353,,
2328,0.97,18161.343,18172.787,"And, when I go on outreach a lot of people say I want to go, I have a couple, I have a dog, I have health issues, I can be around a bunch of people.",353,,
2329,0.97,18172.787,18178.56,"I, I want the NAV center or tiny home.",353,,
2330,0.97,18178.56,18184.699,"Most of the time I let them know that there are no beds today, or there are only two beds, and then they will probably be taken.",353,,
2331,0.97,18184.699,18190.272,Or I let them know that there is one bed but that is for the entire Seattle.,353,,
2332,0.97,18190.272,18198.813,"And I can put in a referral for you but it is highly, highly unlikely you will get that bed.",353,,
2333,0.97,18198.813,18199.814,What are your other options?,353,,
2334,0.97,18199.814,18202.117,And they do not want to go to city hall.,353,,
2335,0.97,18202.117,18204.186,And they don't want to go to an overnight shelter.,353,,
2336,0.97,18204.186,18207.389,They want to go to a place where they can have a stable place to stay.,353,,
2337,0.97,18207.389,18210.692,Work towards housing with the city navigator.,353,,
2338,0.97,18210.692,18216.932,"Ideally, have more mental health and substance abuse support in the shelters people are staying at.",353,,
2339,0.97,18216.932,18221.336,And for the shelters to have more support there too.,353,,
2340,0.97,18221.336,18223.638,I know from shelter staff it is hard on them as well.,353,,
2341,0.97,18223.638,18226.942,So the whole process of getting out of housing is broken.,353,,
2342,0.97,18226.942,18230.145,You have to go to multiple people.,353,,
2343,0.97,18230.145,18233.548,"All of us, all resources, everyone on here does not have enough support.",353,,
2344,0.97,18233.548,18241.356,"So all case managers are packed full and still giving quality care, which is doing the best we can.",353,,
2345,0.97,18241.356,18244.96,With minimal resources.,353,,
2346,0.97,18244.96,18246.361,And it is not working.,353,,
2347,0.97,18246.361,18257.339,And it Sucks that what is being spread out to people is not given an accurate picture of this process.,353,,
2348,0.97,18257.339,18260.675,And the severity of it and how many people are out there is just high numbers.,353,,
2349,0.97,18260.675,18266.681,"But the numbers of people in need are five times the amount higher, 10 times the amount higher.",353,,
2350,0.97,18266.681,18270.385,"Yeah, we all would like to --",353,,
2351,0.97,18270.385,18272.153,Can I ask a follow-up?,354,,
2352,0.97,18272.153,18283.398,"I'm sorry, I didn't want to interrupt your train of thought but it sounds like what you are saying is from your outreach work, I mean there is a, there is much more demand than supply.",354,,
2353,0.97,18283.398,18284.099,Yes.,355,,
2354,0.97,18284.099,18285.367,Yeah.,356,,
2355,0.97,18285.367,18289.104,"And I really, I really want to thank you for highlighting not.",356,,
2356,0.97,18289.104,18293.108,I think that is the crux of a lot of what we are struggling with as a Council here.,356,,
2357,0.97,18293.108,18298.113,And I mean you are on the ground and your work is really instructive in driving at home.,356,,
2358,0.97,18298.113,18310.725,"Can I just add Councilmember Lewis, the responses from Allison, and especially Jessica on the on the ground experience, exactly what I was looking for.",357,,
2359,0.97,18310.725,18321.403,"And I am sure, I hope at least, it was helpful to all Councilmembers because I think that was a very concrete response about what is actually happening and why is it that they end up not in shelters?",357,,
2360,0.97,18321.403,18326.441,In the real situations that they face.,357,,
2361,0.97,18326.441,18330.712,"Jessica, overall thank you for your testimonial.",357,,
2362,0.97,18330.712,18334.749,But especially for highlighting that these are human beings and that they do need privacy.,357,,
2363,0.97,18334.749,18343.058,And that privacy is a big consideration also in terms of what is actually going to work for them and what is not going to work for them.,357,,
2364,0.97,18343.058,18348.129,"Yeah, thank you so much, very good points.",358,,
2365,0.97,18348.129,18354.069,"So, Councilmember Herbold is our next questioner.",358,,
2366,0.97,18354.069,18355.87,May I jump in for a second?,359,,
2367,0.97,18355.87,18356.738,I'm sorry.,360,,
2368,0.97,18356.738,18356.971,Lease.,360,,
2369,0.97,18356.971,18369.117,I just wanted to--a little bit from Councilmember Mosqueda and Councilmember Sawant's previous questions.,361,,
2370,0.97,18369.117,18380.462,"Often me by the people that are left behind to are not accepting services, or not eligible for the services provided are the people with the greatest barriers and greatest challenges.",361,,
2371,0.97,18380.462,18384.899,Whether it is legal background or mental health Profile.,361,,
2372,0.97,18384.899,18393.808,"I believe that Jessica did a really good job about talking about the enhanced services and support needed for those who I have expressed before, who have more service needs.",361,,
2373,0.97,18393.808,18402.784,"I want to also really appreciate that there have been business leaders who are starting to say, we just need the plan.",361,,
2374,0.97,18402.784,18408.289,If you give us the plan we will give you the time to execute the plan.,361,,
2375,0.97,18408.289,18409.524,I really appreciate coordinating with them.,361,,
2376,0.97,18409.524,18430.645,"We also have been, due to coordination and conversation, reach recently went out to second Avenue extension ended in a sensitive extensive assessment, about the communities within the streets and who would be in theory the best match for what services.",361,,
2377,0.97,18430.645,18440.155,"They found that there are a lot of people that would be appropriate and are appropriate for Co-Lead, I having mental health needs.",361,,
2378,0.97,18440.155,18443.057,But we could serve and substance abuse needs that we could serve in hotels.,361,,
2379,0.97,18443.057,18448.663,"But there are individuals out there that exceed the needs, which again highlights an aspect that Jessica was talking to.",361,,
2380,0.97,18448.663,18456.671,"We do believe that this can be supported, these individuals I'm talking about that don't match the code lead model or other models.",361,,
2381,0.97,18456.671,18467.382,"Kind of the Desc host clients, or people with Competencies and issues.",361,,
2382,0.97,18467.382,18473.354,"But in order to do that we have Theorized, and this is much to the work of a colleague of mine, Jesse Binet, who you have heard of.",361,,
2383,0.97,18473.354,18484.599,"That comes back to Councilmember Mosqueda, your question, more extensive support of lodging people in hotels, even though we think it could be possible.",361,,
2384,0.97,18484.599,18496.678,"That allows those individuals to shelter in place, they need more than one engagement, they need meals brought to them and likelihood of a staff on site 24/7.",361,,
2385,0.97,18496.678,18508.59,"And an overnight support staff that can support and engage in the individuals to make plans and have medical service providers, mental health providers, substance abuse providers, go to those places and meet them.",361,,
2386,0.97,18508.59,18517.732,If that was all package that is the support we see that could make a positive impact for people like Lisa Howard's constituency who are saying they need to open businesses and make thing happened.,361,,
2387,0.97,18517.732,18519.734,But right now it is not attainable to do that.,361,,
2388,0.97,18519.734,18529.744,"But just to be clear Tara, sorry Councilmember Lewis.",362,,
2389,0.97,18529.744,18532.547,If I could just say because Tara and I spoke about it earlier.,362,,
2390,0.97,18532.547,18535.216,We need to get to a few more questions but go ahead.,363,,
2391,0.97,18535.216,18535.45,Please.,363,,
2392,0.97,18535.45,18537.118,Believe me we are ready to wrap up.,364,,
2393,0.97,18537.118,18543.124,[Laughter] I want to be clear it is not that we don't have the skilled folks to be able to serve people.,364,,
2394,0.97,18543.124,18545.36,It is that there is not a place for them to go.,364,,
2395,0.97,18545.36,18562.877,"So whereas we never had enough shelter, there was some level of turnover, something like between 5% and 12% for single adult shelters, and so there was some sort of a form, if you will, of a game of musical chairs.",364,,
2396,0.97,18562.877,18564.679,Musical mats on the floor.,364,,
2397,0.97,18564.679,18569.284,Now it is one or two spots a day.,364,,
2398,0.97,18569.284,18573.655,"For a week rather, opening up.",364,,
2399,0.97,18573.655,18583.598,"So, those folks that Tara is talking about, absolutely would fit with services provided by other skilled teams in our community.",364,,
2400,0.97,18583.598,18586.668,But we don't have physical rooms for those folks.,364,,
2401,0.97,18586.668,18589.304,That's what we need.,364,,
2402,0.97,18589.304,18593.408,Thank you so much.,365,,
2403,0.97,18593.408,18598.379,"So, Councilmember Herbold, you are up next for a question.",365,,
2404,0.97,18598.379,18599.013,Thank you.,366,,
2405,0.97,18599.013,18600.615,It is short and for Allison.,366,,
2406,0.97,18600.615,18612.193,"Allison, can you give me or us your opinion on what the appropriate role is for the navigation team in regards to Covid-19 testing?",366,,
2407,0.97,18612.193,18615.63,"In a word, no.",367,,
2408,0.97,18615.63,18620.601,[Laughter] I mean I can give you my opinion.,367,,
2409,0.97,18620.601,18622.804,And it is a terrible idea.,367,,
2410,0.97,18622.804,18644.659,"But I think that there are good people who are associated with the navigation team and what seems not to be understood very generally, perhaps that is a result of human nature, is that the navigation team is not generally speaking a trusted set of factors in the community.",367,,
2411,0.97,18644.659,18652.133,"And in order to do a good job with testing, you need to have trust.",367,,
2412,0.97,18652.133,18664.779,"So, that idea was raised to me several weeks ago and I explained that I thought that it would not be a very smart or respectful idea.",367,,
2413,0.97,18664.779,18679.694,"And in fact, I think the people who are really skilled at doing that are actually out there talking to folks.",367,,
2414,0.97,18679.694,18696.711,"And there are a lot of people, whether they are folks who work in places like the Seattle Indian health board, or other Healthcare settings in the community already, or people who are part of skilled medical integrated outreach teams in the community already, who are actively engaging with people.",367,,
2415,0.97,18696.711,18700.481,And that is what we have to rely on and bolster.,367,,
2416,0.97,18700.481,18723.738,"But, somebody who is associated with just disrupting a place where people are living, is not that, that really is again the opposite of what is effective in terms of gaining enough trust from someone to have them agreed to be tested.",367,,
2417,0.97,18723.738,18743.658,"And then as I said in my remarks, I am also concerned that in terms of doing appropriate contact tracing, that Realy is something where the skill set that Community- based organizations and their staff and outreach teams in the community have, is highly relevant.",367,,
2418,0.97,18743.658,18762.276,"If someone you did not know walked up to you and asked a lot of personal questions about who you have been spending time with and asked if you would have a test, when you really don't have a lot of information about what that test is and what the results of having a test are going to be for your life, you would probably also refuse.",367,,
2419,0.97,18762.276,18767.882,[Laughter] and we need to encourage people and give them information.,367,,
2420,0.97,18767.882,18772.887,That is one of the other things that sorely has been lacking.,367,,
2421,0.97,18772.887,18776.958,"I think Jessica's point was a good one, that she is a source of information.",367,,
2422,0.97,18776.958,18782.396,A lot of people that I have been expressing homelessness have asked me if I have a newspaper.,367,,
2423,0.97,18782.396,18785.366,People don't have information about what is going on.,367,,
2424,0.97,18785.366,18790.371,We need to go back to the basics of providing solid education and information.,367,,
2425,0.97,18790.371,18793.174,Thank you.,368,,
2426,0.97,18793.174,18794.642,Allison thank you so much.,369,,
2427,0.97,18794.642,18803.818,"Councilmember Morales has the last question, at which point I have one final question and then we will finish with the panel.",370,,
2428,0.97,18803.818,18805.92,"So, Councilmember Morales",370,,
2429,0.97,18805.92,18811.292,"Councilmember Lewis can I ask a process question, please?",371,,
2430,0.97,18811.292,18815.329,Sorry to interrupt.,371,,
2431,0.97,18815.329,18817.131,But you would know the answer to the question.,371,,
2432,0.97,18817.131,18818.799,Are we expecting a boat?,371,,
2433,0.97,18818.799,18824.338,I am just asking because it is running into the next meeting.,371,,
2434,0.97,18824.338,18831.546,"Yes, I think considering the late hour and the discussion, I would not, there will not be a vote today, at least that would be my preference.",372,,
2435,0.97,18831.546,18832.146,Thank you.,373,,
2436,0.97,18832.146,18833.047,Yes.,374,,
2437,0.97,18833.047,18836.35,Yes.,374,,
2438,0.97,18836.35,18838.352,Councilmember Morales.,374,,
2439,0.97,18838.352,18842.957,"So, I, well, that is basically where I was going.",375,,
2440,0.97,18842.957,18852.767,I want to think Jessica for your powerful testimony and hearing the sort of nuts and bolts about how this shelter referral system works or does not work.,375,,
2441,0.97,18852.767,18861.576,"And getting a real on the ground understanding of that sort of Byzantine nature of what people are put through, is really important for us to understand.",375,,
2442,0.97,18861.576,18868.583,"Allison mentioned, you know the navigation team being a Gatekeeper for hundreds of rooms.",375,,
2443,0.97,18868.583,18873.354,I think it is clear we really need to dig into how to address those questions.,375,,
2444,0.97,18873.354,18881.295,And those challenges so we can actually be serving people better.,375,,
2445,0.97,18881.295,18900.815,"And, given that we are heading into the sixth hour of this conversation, my question to the chair was going to be if we were planning on having another meeting so we can discuss the amendments and actually move the bill and keep the conversation going.",375,,
2446,0.97,18900.815,18901.682,Certainly.,376,,
2447,0.97,18901.682,18908.823,But let's finish with this panel and then have that discussion is how I would refer to handle that.,376,,
2448,0.97,18908.823,18914.695,"So, Councilmember Morales, any other questions for the panel?",376,,
2449,0.97,18914.695,18915.029,Okay.,376,,
2450,0.97,18915.029,18921.335,I have one final question and then we will close it out.,376,,
2451,0.97,18921.335,18923.738,And it is for Lisa Howard.,376,,
2452,0.97,18923.738,18928.442,"So, Lisa Howard, this is just a process question.",376,,
2453,0.97,18928.442,18942.456,"I want to ask, because I am on a call every week with the bias and I appreciate the meeting with the bias in the city.",376,,
2454,0.97,18942.456,18948.562,I was just speaking about the Bia and functions they serve.,376,,
2455,0.97,18948.562,18950.831,We all have a common goal of getting our neighbors inside.,376,,
2456,0.97,18950.831,18968.049,"And I think one thing we have releasing today from this conversation is any way out of this is going to require some Prioritization increasing the amount of placements that can be offered by our outreach workers, be they tiny House villages, hotels, whatever.",376,,
2457,0.97,18968.049,18975.356,"And can I work with you and the other Bia directors, to see if we can build some common cause?",376,,
2458,0.97,18975.356,18978.292,I am focusing on Scaling up.,376,,
2459,0.97,18978.292,18982.396,And can we engage vertically on that as an area of advocacy?,376,,
2460,0.97,18982.396,18991.706,Where the bias can be an ally in this?,376,,
2461,0.97,18991.706,18992.106,Yes.,377,,
2462,0.97,18992.106,18998.512,"And I think one of the challenges now is that with Covid-19, our--have been completely destroyed.",377,,
2463,0.97,18998.512,19009.523,"So what we are facing is districts, significantly harder, everyone is facing right now anything significantly harder than we have faced to date.",377,,
2464,0.97,19009.523,19015.396,And so I think that we need both short and long-term relief on this.,377,,
2465,0.97,19015.396,19022.57,And I think the solution is going to be a mix and not one single thing.,377,,
2466,0.97,19022.57,19044.458,"I think everybody has to come to the table to do that and work together, to make sure that there will be relief for both the districts, the businesses, the Stakeholders of Seattle as well as the populations currently living on the street and eating resources . We do not have the place and we have challenges in place for a really long time.",377,,
2467,0.97,19044.458,19046.827,It is not any easier during the pandemic.,377,,
2468,0.97,19046.827,19050.431,But yes.,377,,
2469,0.97,19050.431,19054.835,I look forward to following up with you on that and a lot of the folks I called in earlier today.,378,,
2470,0.97,19054.835,19055.136,Thank you.,378,,
2471,0.97,19055.136,19056.27,Thank you so much panel.,378,,
2472,0.97,19056.27,19056.771,Thank you.,379,,
2473,0.97,19056.771,19063.744,I am going to make a few comments here and kind of what I see is steps forward based on this conversation today.,380,,
2474,0.97,19063.744,19076.59,"You know, I really appreciate the opportunity to hear from a lot of folks from the executive, to hear from folks who will our community members, service providers on the front lines of this.",380,,
2475,0.97,19076.59,19083.497,And the well over 100 people who called in during public comment to express their opinion on this.,380,,
2476,0.97,19083.497,19097.278,"I want to thank Councilmember Morales for submitting, based on all that, very Pressey Aunt legislation that has really sparked an important conversation.",380,,
2477,0.97,19097.278,19103.117,And certainly something that we need to grapple with.,380,,
2478,0.97,19103.117,19122.136,I think that the first thing I want to say is you know I very pointedly asked senior deputy Mayor Phong whether there would be a path forward here Legislatively in terms of getting a set from the executive.,380,,
2479,0.97,19122.136,19135.249,"My read of the response from senior deputy Mayor Fong was pretty Unequivocal, that they did not think the legislative path was something they could see themselves Assenting to.",380,,
2480,0.97,19135.249,19161.642,"And then they were also Unequivocal in thing that they do want to work with this Council to advance potentially some of these issues through alternative means along the lines of what Councilmember Mosqueda, and I, have been talking about pursuing in our later we sent in late March.",380,,
2481,0.97,19161.642,19170.584,I want to take the executive up on their offer to come to the table and talk to us as a Council.,380,,
2482,0.97,19170.584,19182.563,"I think Esther Lucero pointed rather well, saying we should be able to find a way in the city to come together and reach some kind of accord.",380,,
2483,0.97,19182.563,19187.067,I do think the executive was Ernest in their interest in getting together.,380,,
2484,0.97,19187.067,19189.303,And I will flag three areas I want to address.,380,,
2485,0.97,19189.303,19190.971,With the executive.,380,,
2486,0.97,19190.971,19196.81,That get to the underlying issues we are trying to deal with with this legislation.,380,,
2487,0.97,19196.81,19213.227,"First, I want us to dive into and look at a plan or a path with some kind of consultative conversation about the Multidepartmental administrative rules that currently navigate the team.",380,,
2488,0.97,19213.227,19223.204,"How we can evaluate how they are working, where there is room for the improvement in those rules and what changes we can make to improve and fix those rules.",380,,
2489,0.97,19223.204,19230.744,Along the lines of the posture that this Council had adopted in the early spring.,380,,
2490,0.97,19230.744,19267.247,"I want to discuss with other Stakeholders some special and unique resources we have from the state and Federal partners, as well as other resources to scale up certain placements, be they hotels, be they tiny houses, as we heard extensive testimony today from all of our panelists that tiny houses, hotels, shelter options that are working effectively undesirable and endorsed by our outreach workers.",380,,
2491,0.97,19267.247,19290.704,"And there is admittedly, and this is not just a post Covid- 19, not just a Covid-19 era problem, there has been a long- term lack of supply of the shelter options and ways to build on and expand those kinds of options so we can get more folks out of Unsanctioned Encampments and inside.",380,,
2492,0.97,19290.704,19304.018,"And finally, Co-Lead, just now becoming operational, that has about 120 spaces, that ultimately they will fill with people in Seattle.",380,,
2493,0.97,19304.018,19320.434,And how Co-Lead and the platform that Co-Lead is offering can help inform our encampment removal strategies . I checked with the clerk throughout this committee meeting and June 10th is currently open for a committee meeting.,380,,
2494,0.97,19320.434,19346.727,"I am requesting that we be joined from representatives from CBO, Hsd, and the Mayor's executive team to participate in this table to work through some of these issues and discuss these issues in good faith between this Council and the Mayor to make some meaningful impact on the very real human issues that the city is grappling with and that we have discussed now for 5 1/2 hours.",380,,
2495,0.97,19346.727,19372.686,"You know, for everybody that tuned in for our business owners, for the people in the Encampments, for the folks that live in the neighborhoods in the city, for Renters like myself, for homeowners and property owners, who live in some of the single-family neighborhood in the city, we all have a unified interest despite our different positions to get folks out of Encampments and inside.",380,,
2496,0.97,19372.686,19377.991,And I want that to be the frame for this next conversation we have on the 10th.,380,,
2497,0.97,19377.991,19381.995,And see if we can come to some kind of accord on this.,380,,
2498,0.97,19381.995,19386.5,I think everybody came to the table today with an interest of doing that.,380,,
2499,0.97,19386.5,19398.746,"You know, I think that also going back to the procedures on this legislation, there have been some amendments that have been introduced and that legislation warrants do discussion and consideration of those amendments.",380,,
2500,0.97,19398.746,19403.584,With a little more time for people to review them.,380,,
2501,0.97,19403.584,19428.609,"So again, I think just because the hour is late, I propose that we move this discussion, and I will work with Councilmember Herbold and the executive team to shape an agenda for the June 10th meeting and work through these issues together as a unified city government, to make progress in areas where all of us acknowledge there is progress to be made.",380,,
2502,0.97,19428.609,19431.645,And we heard a lot of that from all corners of this discussion today.,380,,
2503,0.97,19431.645,19437.751,And I look forward to that discussion on June 10th.,380,,
2504,0.97,19437.751,19439.319,Hopefully that will not go until 7:30.,380,,
2505,0.97,19439.319,19443.323,"So, with that I want to turn it over to comments from other Councilmembers.",380,,
2506,0.97,19443.323,19449.329,Before we go to new business.,380,,
2507,0.97,19449.329,19454.134,"Mr. chair, may I speak?",381,,
2508,0.97,19454.134,19455.068,Yes.,382,,
2509,0.97,19455.068,19457.271,Thank you.,383,,
2510,0.97,19457.271,19460.073,First of all I want to thank everybody for 5 1/2 hours.,384,,
2511,0.97,19460.073,19466.48,"And I do agree with your leadership chairman, that we move this over to June 10th.",384,,
2512,0.97,19466.48,19488.302,"I think in light of 5 1/2 hours hearing from these complex issues from our service providers, from the executive, and our colleagues, that I feel I need more time off-line to have some of my outstanding questions addressed and some of the ones you have addressed that some we may be able to solve administratively.",384,,
2513,0.97,19488.302,19493.974,Some of it may be through legislation.,384,,
2514,0.97,19493.974,19508.188,"But I do not believe that at this juncture I am prepared and cannot speak for my colleagues, obviously, that we and I would welcome the opportunity between now and June 10th to look again at the base legislation and go back over the three amendments.",384,,
2515,0.97,19508.188,19511.892,Because I have many outstanding questions and think a lot of this we can get answered Off- line.,384,,
2516,0.97,19511.892,19517.331,I do not want to spend another 5 1/2 hours on this.,384,,
2517,0.97,19517.331,19518.699,Thank you.,384,,
2518,0.97,19518.699,19524.705,Any other Councilmembers wishing to speak?,385,,
2519,0.97,19524.705,19525.672,There,385,,
2520,0.97,19529.076,19529.376,Okay.,386,,
2521,0.97,19529.376,19532.045,I am not seeing anyone else jumping in for it.,386,,
2522,0.97,19532.045,19534.514,Sorry.,386,,
2523,0.97,19534.514,19536.149,Councilmember Morales.,386,,
2524,0.97,19536.149,19539.453,Sorry.,387,,
2525,0.97,19539.453,19543.524,"I was Toggling on the surface thing, it just is not my thing.",387,,
2526,0.97,19543.524,19551.965,I wanted to just give a final thank you to everybody who has been sitting with us on this conversation for many hours now.,387,,
2527,0.97,19551.965,19560.04,"I do think that it has raised, brought into relief just how critical this issue is.",387,,
2528,0.97,19560.04,19565.045,We have a lot of things that need to be adjusted.,387,,
2529,0.97,19565.045,19578.091,"W need to make sure that we are actually serving the most vulnerable in our community, and that includes providing the kind of systems that allow for our service providers to do their job.",387,,
2530,0.97,19578.091,19593.307,"Listening to Jessica talk about the grind that she goes through with a client, to get one person into housing, knowing that we have thousands of people who need support and help.",387,,
2531,0.97,19593.307,19596.91,I think it is troubling that things are so broken.,387,,
2532,0.97,19596.91,19616.63,"And if nothing else, this five hours has really, my hope, is that it really helped us understand that we have a lot of work to do to serve our community, to serve our homeless neighbors, and make sure that the essential workers who are on the front lines, try to do the best that they can for our neighbors.",387,,
2533,0.97,19616.63,19621.935,"Have the resources that they need, the systems and infrastructure they need to do their job well.",387,,
2534,0.97,19621.935,19628.041,So that we can move this homelessness crisis out of the crisis column.,387,,
2535,0.97,19628.041,19631.311,And actually support our community better.,387,,
2536,0.97,19631.311,19633.113,So I want to thank everybody.,387,,
2537,0.97,19633.113,19639.653,I am looking forward to moving together and working in partnership to do the right thing.,387,,
2538,0.97,19639.653,19653.333,"And, my hope is that we will have, as you said, Councilmember Lewis, have a sincere effort to bring folks together and solve the problem.",387,,
2539,0.97,19653.333,19658.972,And commit to the investment in the system changes that we need to serve people.,387,,
2540,0.97,19658.972,19659.773,Thank you.,387,,
2541,0.97,19659.773,19662.776,Thank you so much Councilmember.,388,,
2542,0.97,19662.776,19667.881,"With that, before we adjourn, is there any new, I'm sorry, Councilmember Mosqueda.",388,,
2543,0.97,19667.881,19675.389,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,389,,
2544,0.97,19675.389,19694.307,"I just wanted to echo the points, an excellent summary about the powerful testimony from both of the panels and I really appreciate your leadership Councilmember Lewis, in outlining the three buckets where we are expecting answers in those areas.",389,,
