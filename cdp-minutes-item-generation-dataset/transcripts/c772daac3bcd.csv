1254,0.97,5588.649,5601.629,"Instead, in this version, a Stakeholder process would develop a proposal for use of the funds.",562,,
1255,0.97,5601.629,5619.213,"I voted no on the revised proposal, because I'm concerned that the Council is handing the decision of whether we should provide funding necessary to implement auditor recommendations to a Stakeholder group might decide that the funds should be used for other purposes.",562,,
1256,0.97,5619.213,5624.285,I believe it is up to the Council and the Mayor to make the tough decisions on how to implement recommendations of the city auditor.,562,,

1261,0.97,5672.233,5675.636,The Council will not have the opportunity to discuss funding until that time.,562,,
1262,0.97,5675.636,5682.543,The options for dedicated transfer funding to address maintenance on our critical bridges is limited.,562,,
1263,0.97,5682.543,5690.051,The 2015 move levy was set up a little differently than the previous bridging the gap levy.,562,,
1264,0.97,5690.051,5696.59,The previous levy dedicated a higher portion of funds to maintenance than the new levy does.,562,,
1265,0.97,5696.59,5706.901,The move levy started moving in a direction away from maintaining critical infrastructure.,562,,

1268,0.97,5718.312,5721.182,"The Mayor, as we all know, chose to proceed with the repair for the bridge.",562,,
1269,0.97,5721.182,5730.891,"I wholeheartedly agree with this decision, in part due to significantly lower capital costs and the time it required to build a new bridge.",562,,
1270,0.97,5730.891,5736.197,The ongoing maintenance cost will be higher for the Seattle bridge.,562,,
1271,0.97,5736.197,5742.002,This is going to be an issue that I am going to be continuing to weigh in on.,562,,
1272,0.97,5742.002,5756.15,"Again, as I said, to keep things interesting, here, I will work consistently with my committee vote and not support this legislation, thank you.",562,,
1273,0.97,5756.15,5763.657,"Councilmember Mosqueda, and is there anyone else wanted to make a comment?",563,,

1278,0.97,5777.238,5795.689,"I want to say for the record, earlier, about support from the building construction trades, I wanted to thank the iron workers, they send in a letter that said that they support the bridge maintenance but we also understand the need for oversight.",564,,
1279,0.97,5795.689,5806.6,[Indiscernible] we are excited to have a seat at the table.,564,,
1280,0.97,5806.6,5808.068,We are excited to working with you.,564,,
1281,0.97,5808.068,5814.575,That's the piece I wanted to read and for the record and think our friends in the local trades and be sure that the comment got recorded for the record.,564,,
1282,0.97,5814.575,5823.717,Thank you so much for those comments and conversation.,565,,
1283,0.97,5823.717,5827.021,We had a really protective conversation about the amendment that led to this final Council bill.,565,,
1284,0.97,5827.021,5840.167,"I want to Belabor the point, I do think the original sponsors, Pederson, Lewis and Herbold.",565,,
1285,0.97,5840.668,5843.604,There have been some comments that this is an increase in the license fee.,565,,
1286,0.97,5843.604,5847.308,It's actually a decrease in the vehicle license fee.,565,,
1287,0.97,5847.308,5851.545,Folks through the end of the year will be paying $80.,565,,
1288,0.97,5851.545,5855.216,"The vehicle license fee starting in 2021, that will be reduced to a total of $40.",565,,
1289,0.97,5855.216,5862.122,This is not an increase in the vehicle license fee.,565,,
1290,0.97,5862.122,5875.336,I want to make sure that the record was correct with regard to that particular issue.,565,,
1291,0.97,5875.336,5891.952,"Secondly, I continue to hear and appreciate Councilmember Herbold's comments around the question about the Stakeholder process.",565,,
1292,0.97,5891.952,5902.563,"And the relevance to policy decisions by the Council in short order, related to how we are going to spend the dollars.",565,,
1293,0.97,5902.563,5905.766,I would be committed to making sure that we have the benefit of the Stakeholder information.,565,,
1294,0.97,5905.766,5918.379,"Of course, at the end of the day, it is up to city Council to make budget appropriation authorities within our charter mandated duties.",565,,
1295,0.97,5918.379,5921.215,"Again, there will be recommendations, but not mandates coming out of the Stakeholder group.",565,,
1296,0.97,5921.215,5931.659,I think that we will benefit from having the Stakeholder group come together and take a look at best use of these dollars.,565,,
1297,0.97,5931.659,5935.829,I recognize that the vehicle license in the past has been largely dedicated to transit purposes and not to bridge maintenance.,565,,
1298,0.97,5935.829,5962.856,"But, we have a new set of information for us that does provide us with additional information around the need to take care of our bridges as sort of a basic part of our infrastructure that connects buses and cyclists and pedestrians and other vehicle users throughout the city.",565,,
1299,0.97,5962.856,5965.592,I think it is important for us to take that into consideration.,565,,
1300,0.97,5965.592,5978.539,"So, I hope we will be able to have that abbreviated Stakeholder process that will yield us some rich information that we can consider in our deliberations as we work towards shaping a plan.",565,,
1301,0.97,5978.539,6041.301,"I also want to acknowledge that Councilmember Herbold has mentioned City Resources related to constant revenue streams for bridge maintenance--I also just think that we would be Remiss not acknowledging that we also have some great members of congressional delegation, for example, who have been Championing funding at this level, especially the West Seattle bridge, I want to thank the Congressman from our congressional district, here, in particular, who was just last week able to secure additional funding for the West Seattle bridge, and I think that there are going to be--I hope, now, with a new administration, more opportunities for us to work closely with Federal delegation to continue to advocate for Federal dollars for--for this particular need to serve a long- term strategy.",565,,
1302,0.97,6041.301,6044.505,"I mean, there is a lot of work that we can do, here.",565,,
1303,0.97,6044.505,6050.01,The legal license fee gives us $7.2 million a year.,565,,
1304,0.97,6050.01,6052.246,The needs related to bridges is a total of $100 million.,565,,
1305,0.97,6052.246,6068.729,"We certainly need a lot more resources available to really meet the minimal need, which I understand the auditor identified is $3.4 million.",565,,
1306,0.97,6068.729,6079.039,I think we are all committed to figuring this out into making sure that we can balance all of the needs related to our infrastructure and Outwork--appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with all of you on these important issues.,565,,
1307,0.97,6079.039,6079.44,All right.,565,,
1308,0.97,6079.44,6086.98,"Well, I think, I don't see any additional comments, here.",565,,
