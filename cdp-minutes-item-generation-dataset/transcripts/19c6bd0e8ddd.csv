25,0.97,86.986,90.623,"Madam clerk, would you please read into the record number 3?",16,,
26,0.97,90.623,92.525,Seattle police Department discussion.,17,,
27,0.97,92.525,95.995,"Well, that was perfect timing for that siren.",18,,
28,0.97,95.995,97.13,"Thank you, so much Madam clerk.",18,,
29,0.97,97.13,101.901,Appreciate all of you for joining us back again.,18,,

32,0.97,120.019,123.556,Really appreciate the work you've done along with the team.,18,,
33,0.97,123.556,127.894,Look forward to hearing it this afternoon.,18,,
34,0.97,127.894,138.338,"Thank you, Madam chair, yes, it's a little long, but SPD is of high attention, so we wanted to give you as much information as we could.",19,,
35,0.97,138.338,144.677,"The presentation will be a little long too, but I'll try and move as quickly as I can.",19,,
36,0.97,144.677,149.482,"I want to start out with the first slide, Patty, if you'd switch it, please.",19,,
37,0.97,153.019,161.761,This is an overview of the entire Department and the changes in the 2021 budget from the 2020 adopted.,19,,
38,0.97,161.761,177.81,"What I would point out with this particular table, of course, it's standard in all our presentations, is that most of the changes made here are the result of the transfer of units out of SPD and into external entities.",19,,
39,0.97,177.81,181.881,We'll be talking about that in some depth today.,19,,
40,0.97,181.881,196.029,"There is a, um, there is a percent increase in leadership and administration, and that is a technical adjustment that is made by Reallocating some of the SPD's internal service cost.",19,,
41,0.97,196.029,207.04,"Just about all the negatives you see here, in fact all the negatives you see here deal with moving functions out of the SPD so other units, which we will address.",19,,
42,0.97,207.04,210.476,"So, I'm ready to go on unless someone wants to stop now.",19,,
43,0.97,212.679,214.247,I don't see any questions.,20,,
44,0.97,214.247,214.747,"Thanks, Greg.",20,,
45,0.97,214.747,216.683,"All right, so Patty, if you'd flip to the next one, please.",21,,
46,0.97,219.752,226.693,I'm going to start out with a pie chart that you saw last June on June 10th.,21,,
47,0.97,226.693,239.839,"This is an overview of SPD's budget I think it's potentially instructive to go over it again just so that, um, you in the public understand how the budget is put together and where the money is spent.",21,,
48,0.97,239.839,250.183,"In terms of this particular budget, it is about, um, Oh, it's about 81% personnel costs.",21,,
49,0.97,250.183,254.153,That's a combination of both position costs and overtime.,21,,
50,0.97,254.153,264.897,"You can see the 73.9% in the blue, and then the 15.3%, or, I'm sorry, the 6.9% in the Orange.",21,,
51,0.97,264.897,274.907,"So if you put those two things together, that gets you to 81% or about 291 million of the proposed budget.",21,,
52,0.97,274.907,285.585,"And that is all spent on salaries, and over time about 1400 sworn and 4800 civilian FTE.",21,,
53,0.97,285.585,286.819,The next category is the Interfund charges.,21,,
54,0.97,286.819,290.79,That's the 15.3% in the gray.,21,,
55,0.97,290.79,306.539,"That includes facility costs, um, costs that are allocated, collected by Seattle it for the services they provide by the Seattle Department of human resources for services they provide.",21,,
56,0.97,306.539,311.644,"Um, and in other basic facility costs.",21,,
57,0.97,311.644,321.654,"This is another large part of the budget, and with the Orange, blue, and gray part, you've made up 96% of SPD's budget.",21,,
58,0.97,321.654,324.123,That leaves relatively little for discretionary purchases.,21,,
59,0.97,324.123,327.193,"There's about 14 million left, about 4%.",21,,
60,0.97,327.193,330.163,You can see those remaining slice at the top there.,21,,
61,0.97,330.163,334.267,"And those are for things like fuel, equipment, and discretionary purchases.",21,,
62,0.97,336.969,345.645,"With that as on overview, I would go ahead and move into the changes that's made in the 21 proposed.",21,,
63,0.97,345.645,355.955,"And so, the differences between the 2021 proposed and the 2020 adopted, I'll start out by talking about the position reductions.",21,,
64,0.97,355.955,362.095,"There is among the sworn staff, a 47 FTE reduction of positions.",21,,
65,0.97,362.095,375.308,"That goes from, as you can see in the bullet below, 1497 sworn positions, which is what the Department has historically had there, to 1450 sworn positions.",21,,
66,0.97,375.308,385.118,"While they're only reducing 47 positions, the Mayor's office is also Defunding another 50.",21,,
67,0.97,385.118,396.329,"So of the remaining positions, 1400 are funded, and 50 are unfunded.",21,,
68,0.97,396.329,406.539,"There are no city as a rule civilian position loss, but at the time Mayor Defunded 50.",21,,
69,0.97,406.539,412.011,And then the first you see is the sworn salary reduction.,21,,
70,0.97,412.011,420.686,That's the 15.7 million associated with taking 1497 positions down to 1400.,21,,
71,0.97,420.686,425.258,"There's also a sworn overtime reduction, 2.7 million, that we'll talk about later.",21,,
72,0.97,425.258,427.727,I've identified that as an issue.,21,,
73,0.97,427.727,433.566,That's for special events and also emphasis patrols.,21,,
74,0.97,433.566,437.77,"And finally, there's a civilian salary reduction of $4.1 million to go along with the 40 positions that are unfunded.",21,,
75,0.97,439.372,451.918,So I'll stop there and ask if there's any questions on those high level changes.,21,,
76,0.97,451.918,454.02,"Okay, I'll go ahead and move along.",21,,
77,0.97,454.02,467.8,"The next few items are, as I spoke about before, um, the transfer of different sections out of SPD and into new entities.",21,,
78,0.97,467.8,474.907,"The first one is the parking enforcement transfer into an existing entity, the Seattle Department of transportation.",21,,
79,0.97,474.907,478.711,You have about $15 million and 120Ftes there.,21,,
80,0.97,478.711,496.629,"What's notable about this one is it includes 8,300,000 for special events normally worked by parking enforcement officers when they're directing traffic at either city-wide events like Seafair or sporting events like Seahawks game.",21,,
81,0.97,496.629,508.307,There's a transfer of the emergency management section into a separate executive Department.,21,,
82,0.97,508.307,513.946,That is $2.5 million and 15 FTE.,21,,
83,0.97,513.946,515.781,"And Patty, if you'd flip the slide again.",21,,
84,0.97,515.781,521.42,There's a transfer of the call center into the new Seattle communications center.,21,,
85,0.97,521.42,524.724,There's 18.5 million and 142 FTE.,21,,
86,0.97,524.724,532.331,And these last two transfers will be covered in some detail by my colleague Lisa Kaye towards the end of the presentation.,21,,
87,0.97,532.331,537.77,"So if you have questions about that, she'll go into somewhat of a deep dive.",21,,
88,0.97,537.77,573.673,"Then the last two changes to SPD's budget, there was a civilian OPA investigator supervisor added for 167,000, and there were also some overtime dollars added for automated enforcement, which is going to expand enforcement by cameras to transit only lanes, stopping when traffic is obstructed, as you can read, Crosswalks, and of course restricted lanes, including the lower Seattle bridge during restricted hours.",21,,
89,0.97,573.673,575.942,And those are the changes in the 2021 budget.,21,,
90,0.97,575.942,581.213,So I'll stop again and see if there's any questions before we move into issue identification.,21,,
91,0.97,581.213,583.482,"Wonderful, thank you very much, Greg.",22,,
92,0.97,583.482,589.922,"Um, I am wondering if you might be able to pull up the comparison document.",22,,
93,0.97,589.922,606.238,"Colleagues, I really appreciated this information that Greg has summarized here on slides 3 and 4, and there's more detail, as you know, in the memo that was provided to us, um, the first three pages of the central staff memo.",22,,
94,0.97,606.238,611.51,"For comparison purposes, Greg has offered, or thank you, Greg, for compiling much of the information that is in the memo.",22,,
95,0.97,611.51,632.932,"But for a quick side by side to see how the 2020 adoptive budget compares to what the 2021 proposed budget is and the percentage of change, um, if we're able to do an apples to apples comparison, I thought it would be helpful for us if we were able to see that chart.",22,,
96,0.97,632.932,636.769,"So Greg, if you're able to share that or Patty, that would be wonderful, and we really appreciate your work on this.",22,,
97,0.97,636.769,639.338,I know the information is already within the memo.,22,,
98,0.97,639.338,644.677,You've just pulled it out so it's easier for us to see.,22,,
99,0.97,644.677,645.578,Really appreciate you doing that.,22,,
100,0.97,645.578,646.078,"Greg, back to you.",22,,
101,0.97,646.078,647.279,Thank you.,23,,
102,0.97,647.279,654.12,"And I did pull it out and it is reflective of the functional changes for s approximate, D's budget.",23,,
103,0.97,654.12,669.368,"As you can see, similar to the pie chart that we just went over, we have the expenditure personnel, overtime charges, discretionary purchases, professional services, travel, training, and other costs.",23,,
104,0.97,669.368,679.478,"On the bottom line, you'll see the 2020 adopted that was $409 million is now down to $359 million.",23,,
105,0.97,679.478,695.728,"As I've pointed out, these changes are largely encompassed in the transfers of other functions out of SPD, and the salary reductions the Mayor has made.",23,,
106,0.97,695.728,707.506,"So in terms of comparing 2020 adopted to the 2021 proposed, it's difficult to track exactly, um, it's difficult to track exact will I the changes.",23,,
107,0.97,707.506,709.241,Some are obvious.,23,,
108,0.97,709.241,713.512,You can see that there's a change in Interfund charges.,23,,
109,0.97,713.512,716.248,"That's really apples to apples, but it's also not a whole lot.",23,,
110,0.97,716.248,717.349,It's only 40%.,23,,
111,0.97,717.349,724.957,"But when you look at something like overtime, that, as you can see, is 17%.",23,,
112,0.97,724.957,734.633,"We know that 830,000 of that overtime was transferred out to Sdot as part of the parking enforcement move.",23,,
113,0.97,734.633,751.984,"I would imagine some of the discretionary accounts such as the purchase accounts now down by 12%, that some of that authority for those sections who had discretionary purchase budgets was moved along with the units so.",23,,
114,0.97,751.984,757.089,That may explain why some of the numbers are going down.,23,,
115,0.97,757.089,766.532,It may not be a policy reduction so much as it is a technical reduction of moving the dollars along with the sections that moved to other places.,23,,
116,0.97,772.705,777.576,"Greg, thanks again for pulling this together.",24,,
117,0.97,777.576,791.223,"Council members, any questions about this additional chart which was obviously going to be made available for the public record, but wanted to give you this additional slide?",24,,
118,0.97,791.223,793.359,"Okay, not seeing any additional questions.",24,,
119,0.97,793.359,801.7,"Thank you, Greg for highlighting this, and if there's any follow up questions, we'll come back to it as folks Digest it.",24,,
120,0.97,801.7,813.579,"All right, I'll ask Patty to move to issue one which is staffing.",25,,
121,0.97,813.579,814.747,"Oh, well, issue identification.",25,,
122,0.97,814.747,818.884,"Well, I don't think I went over these, so I'll go over these.",25,,
123,0.97,818.884,829.228,"The first one being police staffing, the second the overtime reductions we talked about, and the third being the 2020 Mid-Year reductions.",25,,
124,0.97,829.228,842.308,"Talk about what happened in the middle of 2020 and how it relates to 2021, and my colleague Lisa will talk about 911 dispatch and OEM and the transfers there.",25,,
125,0.97,842.308,846.078,So we'll go ahead and move to the next side.,25,,
126,0.97,846.078,847.246,"Greg, real quick, council member Herbold?",26,,
127,0.97,847.246,848.08,Thank you.,27,,
128,0.97,848.08,857.79,"I just want to make sure I read your memo, I have not, um, my apologies, gone through this presentation.",27,,
129,0.97,857.79,899.999,"As it relates to issue identification for police staffing, um, you are going to address the issue related to the number um, of, positions in the proposed 2021 budget both funded and unfunded as relates to the new information we have, um, around separations, um, and the fact that, um, there may not be a need for, even from the executive's perspective, given the time it takes to hire for vacant positions.",27,,
130,0.97,899.999,927.86,"There may not be a need for the, um, the full 1450, 1400 positions, funded positions given the, um, the fact that to fill the vacant positions we're seeing now, um, they may not be able to spend all the dollars in 2021.",27,,
131,0.97,927.86,929.495,"Yes, I will.",28,,
132,0.97,929.495,934.633,And you've already taken my punch line.,28,,
133,0.97,934.633,940.072,The 2021 proposed budget is based on 1400 funded FTE and the Department won't get there.,28,,
134,0.97,940.072,941.84,They're going to get to about 1357.,28,,
135,0.97,941.84,946.412,"But we'll go into that a little bit later, Yeah.",28,,
136,0.97,946.412,951.283,"So Patty, if you flip to the next slide, please.",28,,
137,0.97,951.283,960.392,"This shows an eight-year history of the Department's funding and hiring, and just to walk you through this table a little bit, funded FTE.",28,,
138,0.97,960.392,969.268,"The column that's second to the right or second to the left, sorry, includes fully trained officer, student officers, and recruits.",28,,
139,0.97,969.268,971.904,That's everybody that would be part of the sworn hiring plan.,28,,
140,0.97,971.904,991.89,"Then if you skip all the way to the end, fully trained officers are only those officers who have completed what SPD calls phase 2 field training, and they can be independently deployed through the computer aided dispatch system as 911 responders.",28,,
141,0.97,991.89,993.258,That's when an officer becomes deployable and useful.,28,,
142,0.97,993.258,1005.137,"So there's obviously a lot of time that happens from the time an officer is hired, about a full year of training, four of five months at the Academy, and then phase 1 and phase 2 field training.",28,,
143,0.97,1005.137,1013.112,It takes about a full year before they become fully trained and usable by the Department.,28,,
144,0.97,1013.112,1022.221,"That's a Statistic at the end, fully trained, that's important to SPD because it denotes the number of folks that can be deployed.",28,,
145,0.97,1022.221,1037.97,"And so sort of walking you through this table which you can see over the last eight years, the city has steadily increased SPD's funded FTE, and in an effort to boost hiring and increase the Department's number of fully trained officers.",28,,
146,0.97,1037.97,1045.077,"Most recently the city added 10 new Ftes in 2019, and 30 new Ftes in 2020.",28,,
147,0.97,1045.077,1049.848,You can see that in the 2020 original plan row in the table.,28,,
148,0.97,1049.848,1052.251,These efforts have produced mixed results.,28,,
149,0.97,1052.251,1058.757,"While the city has seen some increases in recruit hiring, it's also seen a large number of separations.",28,,
150,0.97,1058.757,1061.36,We'll talk about that a little later today.,28,,
151,0.97,1061.36,1074.406,"The net effect has been a swing between small gains, as you can see there's a 16 Net FTE gain in 2019, and large losses.",28,,
152,0.97,1074.406,1077.509,41 net FTE loss in 2018.,28,,
153,0.97,1077.509,1087.119,"This year, SPD has reduced the internal budget allocations for sworn FTE from 1497 to 1422.",28,,
154,0.97,1087.119,1096.228,"You can see that in the Mid-2020 line, which is called Reviced 2020.",28,,
155,0.97,1096.228,1103.335,And that was an internal function where they went from 1497 down to 1422.,28,,
156,0.97,1103.335,1111.109,"They did that for a couple of reasons, one because they were hiring faster than expected, at least up until the freeze in August.",28,,
157,0.97,1111.109,1117.249,And then the second was because they needed to free up funding for fiscal issues.,28,,
158,0.97,1117.249,1126.358,The significant overtime costs that they Incured due to the George Floyd and black lives matter demonstrations.,28,,
159,0.97,1126.358,1132.498,That's reflected where you see the drop of 1497 to 1422.,28,,
160,0.97,1132.498,1136.301,"Spd's latest staffing projections, as Council member Herbold indicates, are not great.",28,,
161,0.97,1136.301,1142.341,They just came in about a day or two ago.,28,,
162,0.97,1142.341,1144.51,I think publicly released on Friday.,28,,
163,0.97,1144.51,1155.387,They indicate the Department will incur a net hiring loss of 79 FTE in 2020.,28,,
164,0.97,1155.387,1164.563,"They also expect a significant increase in attrition going from 91 separations to 130 separations, which is the updated projection.",28,,
165,0.97,1164.563,1178.81,"As Council member Herbold talked about, the increase in the separation is largely driven by a spike in last month's numbers with 39 total separations.",28,,
166,0.97,1178.81,1184.716,This one month separation total approximated 42% of what the Department experiences in an entire year.,28,,
167,0.97,1184.716,1190.389,"Spd has done an analysis on the separation, and you can find that in Appendix E of the issue paper.",28,,
168,0.97,1190.389,1194.092,I'll summarize it for you.,28,,
169,0.97,1194.092,1201.133,What they found is that 75% of all the separations are coming out of patrol positions.,28,,
170,0.97,1201.133,1210.108,"They also found that of the residence rations or separations, there are more resignations than retirements.",28,,
171,0.97,1210.108,1214.646,About 53 resignations and 50 retirements.,28,,
172,0.97,1214.646,1219.351,"And unlike historic patterns, the resignations are Disproportionally occurring between newer and younger officers.",28,,
173,0.97,1219.351,1228.827,"In fact, about half of the resignations came from officers that were under five years of service.",28,,
174,0.97,1228.827,1235.3,They included 14 Ftes that were either student officers or recruits.,28,,
175,0.97,1235.3,1238.837,Then another 34% were officers that were between 5 and 10 years.,28,,
176,0.97,1238.837,1248.547,"Among all resignations, 25% were people of color.",28,,
177,0.97,1248.547,1250.249,So disproportionately younger folks.,28,,
178,0.97,1250.249,1257.689,"Úi'm highlighting the September separations because the staffing plan, that we talk a lot about, is only as good about the projections made by SPD staff.",28,,
179,0.97,1257.689,1266.965,The department makes these projections based on historically data and information that it's getting point in time from the SPD human resources office.,28,,
180,0.97,1266.965,1280.646,"Staff could not have reasonably predicted what was going to happen in September when creating the plan, they couldn't have Forseen 39 separations in one month.",28,,
181,0.97,1280.646,1287.619,I think the question now is what happens going forward.,28,,
182,0.97,1287.619,1302.2,"The staffing model assumes in October, November, and Údecember a return to normal attrition levels, but that may not come to be given what we've seen in the last month.",28,,
183,0.97,1302.2,1306.338,"With that, I'll start talking about--Yeah?",28,,
184,0.97,1306.338,1309.241,"Yes, I see Council member Herbold and Council member Sawant.",29,,
185,0.97,1309.241,1344.643,"Thank you, I just want to flag, and I didn't see this in issue Id, and it is more related to 2020 and assumptions we made in the 2020 rebalancing, we did make assumptions in the 2020 rebalancing that we would see 30 more separations than the 91 or 92 anticipated by the executive at the beginning of 2020.",30,,
186,0.97,1344.643,1385.317,"And, um, I believe for some reason, I can't remember why, we treated, um, the separations that would occur through Attritions or vacancies the same as we treated, um, the budget action associated with the other reductions that we were seeking, and we Provisod it for a different reason, I guess, it wasn't something we had to bargain, but we couldn't be certain we were actually going to receive the revenue associated with it.",30,,
187,0.97,1385.317,1392.958,"Now that we have it, what does that mean for the 2020 budget?",30,,
188,0.97,1392.958,1406.838,"Are, so we know the executive is very likely going to send us legislation to lift, um, the Provisos for the positions that would need to be bargained.",30,,
189,0.97,1406.838,1427.092,"But for the positions that, um, we are, we are seeing, near the number of vacancies that the Council anticipated would be, can see, can we expect to realize funds from that action that we took over the summer in 2020?",30,,
190,0.97,1429.861,1433.665,"Well, that's a great question, council member Herbold.",31,,
191,0.97,1433.665,1436.434,I think the short answer is yes.,31,,
192,0.97,1436.434,1437.569,Yes to everything you've said.,31,,
193,0.97,1437.569,1453.585,"The start of your question where you talked about the reason that it was Provisod, the attrition, opposed to taking the funding is because at the time, there was no way to know there were going to be 39 separations in one month.",31,,
194,0.97,1453.585,1466.198,"Now that the Department has seen 39 separations in one month, and separations in advance of what they thought was going to occur or in addition to what they thought would occur, there's additional salary funding in the SPD budget.",31,,
195,0.97,1466.198,1472.671,"So the question, I think, for the Council is what to do about that.",31,,
196,0.97,1472.671,1475.907,There are options for the Council.,31,,
197,0.97,1475.907,1480.812,"One might be to, um, not release the Provisos.",31,,
198,0.97,1480.812,1507.639,That's something that we could take a look at as staff and determine if it needs to happen or allow the Council to not left at lift the Provisos.,31,,
199,0.97,1507.639,1534.532,"I think the move to put more officers into patrol and 911 response, we'll talk about that later, um, the effort to focus on making sure response teams are held and that cars re available, there might be a choice to leave the money in the budget for patrol Augmentation, so officers could be back filled on overtime.",31,,
200,0.97,1534.532,1546.811,"But certainly there's money available, and that's something that the Council can discuss.",31,,
201,0.97,1546.811,1548.179,Thank you.,32,,
202,0.97,1548.179,1548.747,Council member Sawant?,33,,
203,0.97,1548.747,1557.188,"I believe, um, the question I have is for a previous slide.",34,,
204,0.97,1557.188,1566.598,I'll apologize because I was away for a few minutes and may have missed what you exactly said.,34,,
205,0.97,1566.598,1570.302,Let me go ahead and ask the question.,34,,
206,0.97,1570.302,1584.416,"When my office looked at the SPD budget, it looked like there was $18.4 million in genuine budget reductions for the SPD, by that I mean not transfers or technical changes.",34,,
207,0.97,1584.416,1588.219,Namely 15.7 million officer reductions and 2.7 million officer overtime reductions.,34,,
208,0.97,1588.219,1592.39,But I think you said there were no reductions other than the transfers?,34,,
209,0.97,1592.39,1595.093,"If you could just, um, explain that again.",34,,
210,0.97,1595.093,1595.427,Sorry.,34,,
211,0.97,1595.427,1598.697,I want to make sure I didn't misunderstand.,34,,
212,0.97,1598.697,1603.234,"Yeah, sure.",35,,
213,0.97,1603.234,1605.604,Really they fall into two categories.,35,,
214,0.97,1605.604,1618.65,"There were the transfers, you noted, out of the Department for the three different sections, and then reductions made for sworn salaries, civilian salaries, and overtime.",35,,
215,0.97,1618.65,1620.819,And the overtime one we'll talk about later.,35,,
216,0.97,1620.819,1630.695,"The sworn salary reduction came along with a reduction in FTE, and that's on, I think the first page of the issue paper and first power point slide.",35,,
217,0.97,1636.568,1638.036,"Thank you, I don't see additional questions at this time.",36,,
218,0.97,1641.506,1650.482,"Okay, so to talk more, well, start talking about the Mayor's proposed budget.",37,,
219,0.97,1650.482,1656.955,"In 2021, it would, as we just talked about, would reduce the number of funded FTE to 1400.",37,,
220,0.97,1656.955,1671.503,"That can be seen in the second to the last line where you see proposed 2021, 1400.",37,,
221,0.97,1671.503,1680.612,"And while the funding is being reduced from a higher level this year to 1400, that's not going to result in fewer hires in 2021.",37,,
222,0.97,1680.612,1688.586,"In fact, as you can see there, the 2021 staffing plan projects a net hiring increase of 25 Ftes.",37,,
223,0.97,1688.586,1694.826,If you go to the far column that says net new officers.,37,,
224,0.97,1694.826,1703.735,"And if you carry that through 2022, you'll see it's 9 Ftes.",37,,
225,0.97,1703.735,1709.908,The disparity exists because that huge loss in 2020 moved their staffing levels below the funding levels.,37,,
226,0.97,1709.908,1720.018,"Because we're in that situation now as a city, it allows some room for growth for the next two years.",37,,
227,0.97,1720.018,1741.339,"Under the Mayor's staffing plan, SPD's sworn staffing levels would eventually catch up with funding levels, and in the years beyond 2022 would probably require another funding boost to sustain increased officer salaries as they move through the ranks from recruits, to training, to fully trained officer.",37,,
228,0.97,1741.339,1757.388,"As you can see in the far right column with the fully trained officer, the Mayor's staffing plan eventually returns the Department's number of fully trained officers to approximately, within one or two, of 2019 levels.",37,,
229,0.97,1757.388,1766.698,And that is certainly a reasonable path for a status quo budget to reflect the same requirements and demands for SPD sworn services.,37,,
230,0.97,1766.698,1785.617,"However, the Council has expressed through its 2020 Mid-Year budget, council bill 119825, a policy preference for a smaller police force that provides fewer services and relies more on community providers to address issues of homelessness, mental illness, and other noncriminal matters.",37,,
231,0.97,1785.617,1797.996,"So in that respect, the Mayor's staffing plan, which attempts to get back to 2019 levels could conflict with the Council's goals as articulated in the 2020 summer budget.",37,,
232,0.97,1797.996,1806.437,"And my last point I was going to make, council member Herbold already made for me.",37,,
233,0.97,1806.437,1824.055,"And that's because the, um, the 2020 spike in attrition happened in September, the Department is below its 1400 FTE level, and therefore, there will be money in 2020.",37,,
234,0.97,1824.055,1825.957,And that will roll forward into 2021.,37,,
235,0.97,1825.957,1835.533,"The Mayor, the police Department will not be able to use all its police salary funding in 2021 either.",37,,
236,0.97,1835.533,1838.336,They'll only reach 1357 filled FTE in the funding for 1400.,37,,
237,0.97,1838.336,1855.286,"So that will also leave the Council with, um, an option to reduce funding in the 2021 budget to sort of sync the salary budget with that the Department is able to do.",37,,
238,0.97,1855.286,1869.3,"I would note that the Department would, their preference would be to leave some of that money in the Department budget for overtime so they could do patrol Augmentation.",37,,
239,0.97,1869.3,1881.646,That would be opposed with a necessity that might be that chief Diaz would have to move more officers from specialty functions into patrol if there wasn't overtime back fill money available.,37,,
240,0.97,1881.646,1884.782,I'll stop there and ask if there's anymore questions.,37,,
241,0.97,1884.782,1885.483,"Thank you, Greg.",38,,
242,0.97,1885.483,1891.155,I'm not seeing any hands or hearing any Council members wanting to weigh in at this moment.,38,,
243,0.97,1896.127,1904.502,"Patty, I'll ask you to flip two sides forward to the chart of SPD sworn officers.",39,,
244,0.97,1904.502,1906.004,One more.,39,,
245,0.97,1906.004,1908.139,"That one, thank you.",39,,
246,0.97,1908.139,1917.448,"So what you're seeing here is an eight year history of the fully trained officers, similar to the table you saw a second ago.",39,,
247,0.97,1917.448,1936.334,"But this gives a visual of the Mayor's 2020 proposed budget, where you see, starting in 2020, officers going from 1295 fully trained officers over the next two years up to 1,329 officers.",39,,
248,0.97,1936.334,1948.479,"I also asked the Department to model a one-year hiring freeze as the Council had expressed its policy preference for a, um, smaller police Department.",39,,
249,0.97,1948.479,1959.791,"I wanted to put this data out there, hopefully to help facilitate the discussion about how the size of the Department might be reduced.",39,,
250,0.97,1959.791,1968.066,"Not to imply that any Council member asked for this, but just to show what a hiring pause might look like.",39,,
251,0.97,1968.066,1990.121,"As you can see here under the purple line, if there was a one-year hiring pause, the amount of fully trained officers goes from $12.95 $12.95 and drops at the end of 2020.",39,,
252,0.97,1990.121,1995.226,And this is a little Counterintuitive.,39,,
253,0.97,1995.226,2004.335,The question being why would it continue to drop for another full year if hiring picked up.,39,,
254,0.97,2004.335,2034.799,"I talked about how it takes a full year to train a police officer, so if the Department paused it's hiring for one year, just through 2021, and started hiring again on Jan 1 of 2022, it would continue to incur attrition losses, but they wouldn't be offset by new officers because the fully trained ones wouldn't come on board until 2023.",39,,
255,0.97,2034.799,2039.237,So a one-year hiring pause has the effect of losing two years of fully trained officers.,39,,
256,0.97,2039.237,2044.375,"Hopefully that makes sense, and I'll stop and ask if there's any questions there.",39,,
257,0.97,2044.375,2046.377,Council member Herbold?,40,,
258,0.97,2046.377,2059.757,"Not so much a question, just a, um, an observation from reading the staffing reports we receive from SPD.",41,,
259,0.97,2059.757,2074.172,"Just want to flag that fully trained officers is not the same as officers in service, and at any given time there's a pretty hefty chunk of officers who are fully trained, but are not in service for a variety of issues.",41,,
260,0.97,2076.24,2076.841,"Yes, that's true.",42,,
261,0.97,2076.841,2078.443,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",42,,
262,0.97,2078.443,2092.323,"There are always going to be officers out on military leave or extended sick leave, and that will decrease the Department's ability to deploy.",42,,
263,0.97,2093.825,2097.295,"Greg, please go ahead, did you have something else on this slide?",43,,
264,0.97,2097.295,2124.455,"Um, I just want to say that the thing about a hiring freeze, if the Council considers that, it seems kind of obvious, but the way the reduction would occur is by officers leaving through attrition and given what we've seen lately around newer, younger officers leaving, um, it seems reasonable that those trends would continue.",44,,
265,0.97,2124.455,2136.067,"If the Council wanted to pursue different options to reduce the size of the force, but have a different effect on demographics there are ways to pursue more targeted reductions.",44,,
266,0.97,2136.067,2157.822,"Targeted reductions could be achieved through officer lay offs as were contemplated in the 2020 Mid-Year budget, or instead of programs that offer cash buy outs or retirement benefits, such they might include retirement enrolling in medical plans or other incentives.",44,,
267,0.97,2157.822,2166.13,"In terms of lay offs, I think the Council is aware there's a couple of ways that could happen.",44,,
268,0.97,2166.13,2198.93,"The default would be Pscsc rule 15, which would be, um, newer, younger officers, reverse seniority lay offs, the last and sort of first out, and then there's also a provision in the civil safety rules that allow for out of order lay offs as outlined in rule 15B, and as you know, that was the preference that you had in Council bill 11825.",44,,
269,0.97,2198.93,2208.973,"Each scenario, whether a hiring freeze or Incentive-Based program would create financial impacts for the city and would have different effects on the demographics of officer that remain on the force.",44,,
270,0.97,2208.973,2220.351,So it would take more staff research to determine what kind of reduction would most closely align with Council member goals.,44,,
271,0.97,2220.351,2220.885,Any questions?,45,,
272,0.97,2220.885,2221.752,I'm seeing none.,45,,
273,0.97,2221.752,2237.268,"Greg, I just want to ask, um, you know, I have seen a number of reports around the country that this is not a unique situation that Seattle is experiencing.",45,,
274,0.97,2237.268,2244.976,"There have been not only Chiefs leaving various departments, but individual officers as well.",45,,
275,0.97,2244.976,2248.98,Do you have any of that comparison or have similar reports?,45,,
276,0.97,2248.98,2255.253,"I've seen similar reports, but I'd have to, um, I'll get some data and share that with you all.",46,,
277,0.97,2255.253,2256.687,"Sure, that's helpful, thank you.",47,,
278,0.97,2256.687,2276.574,"Um, and it might also be helpful, and it doesn't have to be any time soon, maybe we could flag this for one of our offices as I know central staff is very busy as well, but if we have time to look at the type of policies that other cities are looking at as it relates to sworn officer freezes, that might be helpful.",47,,
279,0.97,2276.574,2279.01,I'm familiar with what the city of Austin has done.,47,,
280,0.97,2279.01,2286.117,"They, for example, have a hiring freeze on sworn officers but not things like victim services.",47,,
281,0.97,2286.117,2300.131,It might be informative to see what some other cities who have much larger scale Transformative policies have put in place already comparing Seattle to other cities across the nation.,47,,
282,0.97,2300.131,2307.605,"Excellent, thank you very much.",47,,
283,0.97,2307.605,2309.84,Moving along with patrol staffing.,48,,
284,0.97,2309.84,2310.441,Patty --,48,,
285,0.97,2310.441,2312.309,Hold for one more second.,49,,
286,0.97,2312.309,2313.177,Council member Pederson?,49,,
287,0.97,2313.177,2320.951,"Yes, it's clear from this trend there are different tools to reduce the size of the force.",50,,
288,0.97,2320.951,2333.164,"I didn't know if we're going to talk later about what's the optimal size and what should we be measuring that against, is it response times to priority one calls for example?",50,,
289,0.97,2333.164,2351.315,"I just want to flag that's an interest of mine that as we see the number going down, at what point does it become alarming in that we're going to be losing something else we might value like quick response to priority one calls.",50,,
290,0.97,2351.315,2366.063,"We are going to transition into a topic with patrol staffing here that will, that has a nexus with what you're talking about.",51,,
291,0.97,2366.063,2366.53,Shall I move on?,51,,
292,0.97,2366.53,2368.365,"That would be great, thank you.",52,,
293,0.97,2368.365,2371.502,"Patty could you go back two sides, please?",53,,
294,0.97,2373.838,2374.105,Perfect.,53,,
295,0.97,2374.105,2376.707,That's fine.,53,,
296,0.97,2376.707,2385.316,"Okay, so um, this is the precinct staffing report as of the end of August.",53,,
297,0.97,2385.316,2388.786,What this shows is the various job categories for patrol.,53,,
298,0.97,2388.786,2390.788,"Talking at patrol, it falls into two categories.",53,,
299,0.97,2390.788,2395.926,"One of the 911 response, that you see there in the first row.",53,,
300,0.97,2395.926,2401.599,And that's disproportionately higher than the rest.,53,,
301,0.97,2401.599,2405.736,"The other are specialty patrol units that, um, handle different kinds of problem.",53,,
302,0.97,2405.736,2413.544,"The Anti-Crime team, the community police team, the beats line there is officers on foot beats or bike beats.",53,,
303,0.97,2413.544,2424.855,"They can be deployed by dispatch, but they don't have the CAD, so they're not responding to 911 calls in the same way that the 911 folks are.",53,,
304,0.97,2424.855,2437.668,I point this out as you can see that the number of 911 responders at the end of August was 563.,53,,
305,0.97,2437.668,2444.275,"And, um, I would Goahead and ask Patty to flip to the next slide.",53,,
306,0.97,2444.275,2448.679,This next one is at the end of September.,53,,
307,0.97,2448.679,2457.755,And the reason I point this out is because this reflects the change that chief Diaz made of 100 officers and moving 100 officers into patrol.,53,,
308,0.97,2457.755,2467.498,"And what you can see here is that it BOOSTS the patrol number, or, I'm sorry, the 911 Responder number, by about 105.",53,,
309,0.97,2467.498,2471.869,"But the overall patrol number, the grand total at the bottom, only goes up by 17.",53,,
310,0.97,2471.869,2488.919,"And that's because part of what the chief has done is he is moved the, he's eliminated the Cpt all together and has taken folks out of the other categories, the Act and the beats and moved them into 911 response.",53,,
311,0.97,2488.919,2516.413,"And the reason he's done this is because he has indicated both publicly, um, and also in Q and a with Council's questions that improving response times to 911 calls is, um, is his top priority, and that reducing the Department's reliance on overtime pay and providing stress release to officers going from call to call is his top priority.",53,,
312,0.97,2516.413,2527.291,"So when it comes to a hiring freeze that we've been talking about, his priority does not change.",53,,
313,0.97,2527.291,2540.104,"He was asked by staff as to what would happen if there was the kind of drastic re reduction you saw in the prior charts, and his response was that he'd continue to do more of the same.",53,,
314,0.97,2540.104,2555.452,"He would reduce specialty units, further reduce specialty units, and back fill patrol losses in an effort to ensure that 911 response is as robust as it is today.",53,,
315,0.97,2555.452,2578.809,"And so just taking that position and, um, Extrapolating if the hiring freeze were to happen, and the patrol was held constant at 694, um, then what that would mean is you would be reducing, the chief would be reducing officers in specialty units by about 82 officers by the end of 2022.",53,,
316,0.97,2578.809,2586.183,"Council member Pederson, I think that gets to your question about what happens around response times.",53,,
317,0.97,2586.183,2603.233,"The answer is that they probably don't change, but measures of specialty units, whether it be Swat or harbor patrol or K9, those would be the units impacted the most by a freeze of police hiring.",53,,
318,0.97,2610.975,2611.542,Council member Morales?,53,,
319,0.97,2611.542,2614.378,"Yes, thank you, Greg, this is all really helpful.",54,,
320,0.97,2614.378,2626.256,"I'm not sure if we're on page 8 of the memo with this chart, but I'm looking at it for the purpose of my question.",54,,
321,0.97,2626.256,2627.958,I want to make sure I understand this.,54,,
322,0.97,2627.958,2650.347,"I know in your memo and the conversations we've had with interim chief Diaz, um, he's made clear SPD Prioritizes interactions with the public over investigation, detective work, at least that's my understanding.",54,,
323,0.97,2650.347,2661.792,"And it seems to me that, um, it's unclear to me what Metrics there are for preventing crime and protecting the public.",54,,
324,0.97,2661.792,2676.373,"Do you know if there are, aside from 911 response team, this demonstrates the use of resources over detective and investigative work?",54,,
325,0.97,2676.373,2690.087,I think what you're talking about there is really when you're getting into the world of community policing and the impact that community policing has on preventing crime as opposed to responding to crime.,55,,
326,0.97,2690.087,2705.436,That is something that Dr. Fisher would probably be more suited to answer.,55,,
327,0.97,2705.436,2722.519,"I'm trying to determine if the need for more patrol officers demonstrated or determined by the need to maintain this response time measure, and I'm not sure why that is the measure of how we make those decisions.",56,,
328,0.97,2722.519,2728.525,Is that the metric used for determining how many patrol officers we need?,56,,
329,0.97,2728.525,2735.499,"Yeah, that is actually, um, that is actually one metric that the Department looks at is response times.",57,,
330,0.97,2735.499,2752.95,"They want to maintain response times where they are now, and in the back of the memo you'll find an Appendix that has response times across the city, and then also it has to do with the Proactive time an officer has available.",57,,
331,0.97,2752.95,2763.16,"So it's not just about the response times, but it's about making sure there are enough officers in patrol that they can achieve goals related to community policing.",57,,
332,0.97,2763.16,2775.973,"Here again, that's Interfacing with the community and doing problem solving to try and prevent crime.",57,,
333,0.97,2775.973,2783.046,"Spd hope to have 40% of patrol officers time available for community policing historically, for Interfacing with the community.",57,,
334,0.97,2783.046,2794.158,And that would be a measure that they're hoping for with the 911 officers.,57,,
335,0.97,2794.158,2800.864,"The act, Cpt, and beats, obviously, are more focused on community policing and interaction.",57,,
336,0.97,2800.864,2806.603,"But it's those Metrics that are driving, um, the numbers in patrol, yes.",57,,
337,0.97,2806.603,2810.174,"Well, and I, sorry, chair, I just have a couple more questions.",58,,
338,0.97,2810.174,2838.368,"I'm trying to get clear on something because looking back at the 911 call analysis that we had, um, that we were talking about from July 8th, um, the top 15 types of calls received as I understand it, um, at least the way they were finally classified, only four were classified as straight crimes.",58,,
339,0.97,2838.368,2843.173,"Um, trespass, theft, or Shoplifting or other kinds of theft, and assault.",58,,
340,0.97,2843.173,2849.313,"If I'm reading the graph right, this makes up about 11% of the 911 calls.",58,,
341,0.97,2849.313,2860.958,"I'm sure you don't have this in front of you, but that's what I'm looking at and recalling from our July meeting.",58,,
342,0.97,2860.958,2871.602,"And of those 15 types, only one is a priority call if I understand this, assault is a priority one call.",58,,
343,0.97,2871.602,2888.085,"So the fact that we are using 911 call response time as a measure for how many patrol officers we need, but only 11% of the 911 calls are crimes anyway, doesn't make sense to me, and it's possible I'm not understanding this right.",58,,
344,0.97,2888.085,2890.52,But this is what I'm trying to figure out.,58,,
345,0.97,2890.52,2903.3,"Why are we using that as a measure of how many officers we need when, in fact, what we've learned, is that most of the 911 calls are disturbances.",58,,
346,0.97,2903.3,2913.644,Maybe it's Trespassing or things that aren't categorized as priority one calls.,58,,
347,0.97,2913.644,2914.478,"Yeah, I completely understand --",59,,
348,0.97,2914.478,2914.845,Go ahead.,60,,
349,0.97,2914.845,2919.95,I don't have the information in front of me.,61,,
350,0.97,2919.95,2931.929,"From a technical standpoint, the only difference is if you're looking at calls with a final determination, then they may have been dispatched under a different determination.",61,,
351,0.97,2931.929,2934.164,I know that there's some variance there.,61,,
352,0.97,2934.164,2949.646,"But certainly not meaning in any way shape or form to argue with what you're saying, that are police the best response for, um, calls that are not criminal.",61,,
353,0.97,2949.646,2963.226,"Well, not only that, but why patrol instead of detectives that might be used for human trafficking or theft rings for any of the other functions a member of the force might serve?",62,,
354,0.97,2963.226,2972.569,What are the Metrics for determining how many officers we need in those functions?,62,,
355,0.97,2972.569,2999.429,"I'm just struggling with why so many, especially when community is saying they want less direct contact with the police for reasons of harm that could be caused, um, and we know that there are other kinds of, um, activity that certainly could use some additional resources.",62,,
356,0.97,2999.429,3002.799,I'm just not understanding how that decision making helps the community best.,62,,
357,0.97,3002.799,3010.14,"I understand, and that's really something that, um, I think the chief would be in a better position to explain.",63,,
358,0.97,3010.14,3024.554,"I know there are specific measures for all of the, um, various kinds of units you mentioned, and he'd be in a better position to explain why he would deploy in the manner he's choosing.",63,,
359,0.97,3025.789,3027.057,"Okay, thank you, Greg.",64,,
360,0.97,3030.794,3035.298,"Thank you, council member Morales.",65,,
361,0.97,3035.298,3036.032,Council member Herbold?,65,,
362,0.97,3036.032,3045.275,"Yes, just a wrap up before I ask my question on that last point from Council member Morales.",66,,
363,0.97,3045.275,3071.201,"I'm really supportive of the chief trying to redeploy to address the greatest needs of the Department and of the city for public safety, and even using 911 as a measure, but I would also ask that another level of analysis be included when Redeploying for quicker 911 response just as Council member Morales is saying.",66,,
364,0.97,3071.201,3076.206,It's just a recognition that all 911 calls are not equal.,66,,
365,0.97,3076.206,3103.133,"And if we're trying to hit a number, a minute number on responding to a 911 call, we may not, it may not need to be the same number of minutes for every kind of 911 call, and there may be some 911 calls that we shouldn't, um, think of this reemployment of patrol officers to 911 to answer necessarily more calls.",66,,
366,0.97,3103.133,3129.659,"I mean, that's again, it's not clear to me, um, whether or not the chief wants to just focus on answering the priority one calls more quickly, or if it's a combination of answering the priority one calls quickly, as well as other priority calls quickly, and maybe even answering calls that we're not answering now at all.",66,,
367,0.97,3129.659,3136.433,"That 911 operators are saying sorry, this is a priority three or four call, we won't get to that call.",66,,
368,0.97,3136.433,3149.579,"It's not clear to me, although, like I said, I support that lens, but it's not clear to me how it's being applied.",66,,
369,0.97,3149.579,3153.35,"And again, whether or not we're just treating everything under 911 quality.",66,,
370,0.97,3153.35,3201.631,"To my question, it's still on this topic, and it's, um, I think it's perhaps out of the umbrella of a budget issue, but because you've been talking to the Department a lot about this topic of reemployment to 911 I'm wondering whether or not, um, in their redeployment from specialty units to patrol, whether or not you've had, to 911 patrol, whether or not you've had the opportunity to ask how they chose the specialty units they chose?",66,,
371,0.97,3201.631,3214.044,"I'm still confused to as, for instance, why they've reduced the domestic violence, elder care specialty unit to only one person.",66,,
372,0.97,3214.044,3227.958,I'm confused as to why they didn't reduce the specialty units the Council identified as priorities for reduction during the 2020 budget process.,66,,
373,0.97,3227.958,3229.426,Why do we need a horse patrol?,66,,
374,0.97,3229.426,3237.567,Why couldn't we have done reductions in harbor patrol?,66,,
375,0.97,3237.567,3243.273,"There are, where did the navigation team officers go?",66,,
376,0.97,3243.273,3248.778,"It doesn't appear they've been redeployed to patrol, but they're not on the navigation team anymore?",66,,
377,0.97,3248.778,3257.087,Just wondering whether or not you've been able to get into that level of detail about Redeployments.,66,,
378,0.97,3257.087,3275.372,"What I've heard in the discussions that have happened with the chief that he's talked about, um, returning to historic levels of staffing in some of the specialty units that he has done an analysis of case loads to try and determine where there's capacity.",67,,
379,0.97,3275.372,3283.813,"He's looked at folks that were on loan from other units and patrol really, and returned them.",67,,
380,0.97,3283.813,3287.817,These are the things that he's said.,67,,
381,0.97,3287.817,3292.956,"From a public safety perspective on why one unit was chosen over another, I can't speculate.",67,,
382,0.97,3297.761,3298.328,Thank you.,68,,
383,0.97,3298.328,3333.73,"I will also just flag here, and sorry if this is throwing us a little off topic, but in line with the conversation they were having over how do we best deploy our resources for the number of calls coming into 911, I do want to highlight one of the things I heard at the health one ride along tour was the simple act of having a registered nurse at the 911 call center could help address many of the calls they receive and reduce the need for many of the patrol officers to be in the field.",69,,
384,0.97,3333.73,3351.281,"Many of the recalls they receive with medical in nature, and many of the calls they receive are also people who are worried about something medically related, and to be able to have someone there to answer that question could be helpful.",69,,
385,0.97,3351.281,3353.383,I'm just throwing that in there.,69,,
386,0.97,3353.383,3359.122,I think the right number depends on how many calls we're telling officers they need to respond to in person.,69,,
387,0.97,3359.122,3373.57,"I don't have a form a in on that item, but do want to flag that it's something I'm still interested in looking into the possibility of registered nurse or, um, Arnp.",69,,
388,0.97,3373.57,3388.184,"Some way to offer a triage system like a consulting nurse behind the scenes and I don't know if other cities have something similar, but we'll continue to look into that.",69,,
389,0.97,3388.184,3391.221,Anything else on this slide before we move forward?,69,,
390,0.97,3391.221,3392.422,"All right, let's go ahead.",69,,
391,0.97,3392.422,3402.031,"Patty, if you wouldn't mind taking me to the option slide for issue one.",70,,
392,0.97,3402.031,3403.833,Hopefully it's there.,70,,
393,0.97,3403.833,3405.168,My screen has now blacked out.,70,,
394,0.97,3405.168,3422.252,"But the options staff have identified here with the topic of sworn staffing, the first one is to reduce SPD's budget to capture the unneeded funding in the Mayor's proposed budget.",70,,
395,0.97,3422.252,3430.527,"That's the difference between the 1357 average FTE that they can fill, and the 1400 for which they're funded.",70,,
396,0.97,3430.527,3437.734,Option B would be to reduce the budget to reflect a one-year hiring freeze.,70,,
397,0.97,3437.734,3458.922,"Option C is to reduce SPD's budget to reflect some sort of targeted, um, demographic reduction that might come through a buy out or retirement incentive.",70,,
398,0.97,3458.922,3465.195,"Such a, um, targeted reduction could require separate bargaining.",70,,
399,0.97,3465.195,3488.351,"And the last would be to proviso SPD's budget like was done in 2020, this year, to restrict funding that might not be needed if lay offs were implemented in 2021 either under the Pscs rule that allows for out of order lay offs or the default, which would be Seniority-Based lay offs.",70,,
400,0.97,3488.351,3488.918,Option E is no action.,70,,
401,0.97,3490.553,3499.796,I see no questions on this.,71,,
402,0.97,3499.796,3503.933,Let's keep going.,71,,
403,0.97,3503.933,3505.435,"Oh, council member Herbold, go ahead.",71,,
404,0.97,3505.435,3510.306,"Chair, Mosqueda, I forget what we're supposed to be doing when central staff identifies options.",72,,
405,0.97,3510.306,3516.145,Do you want us to speak to them or just let them go through them and we follow up later?,72,,
406,0.97,3516.145,3519.048,I'm happy to have you speak to them.,73,,
407,0.97,3519.048,3545.575,"What we have done, if you have an item that corresponds with what the central staff is Articulating, I'm asking you to hold that for the form a walk through, but in cases like this and in previous presentations where central staff are identifying areas that don't have a council member name associated with one of the options, if you would like to Chime in, we'd very much appreciate that to hear where you might be coming from or other Council members as well.",73,,
408,0.97,3545.575,3547.176,Thank you.,74,,
409,0.97,3547.176,3581.477,"So I have, I wouldn't call it a corresponding option, it's related, but under, I think issue 3 or Council identified action 3, um, I have an intended reduction to Abregate positions and capture the funding associated with the positions vacant.",74,,
410,0.97,3581.477,3600.93,"I see option a as kind of being a better version of that because of, I mean, as it relates to the salary savings, because of this newly identified issue that was identified after our deadline to submit form a.",74,,
411,0.97,3600.93,3602.865,So I am interested in option a here.,74,,
412,0.97,3604.367,3609.839,"Thank you, council member Herbold for noting that.",75,,
413,0.97,3609.839,3611.441,"Okay, let's continue.",75,,
414,0.97,3611.441,3612.342,I don't see additional hands.,75,,
415,0.97,3612.342,3621.084,"All right, so I'll move to overtime reductions, the emphasis patrols, and special events.",76,,
416,0.97,3621.084,3623.686,"Patty, if you would move into issue two please.",76,,
417,0.97,3623.686,3630.96,I'll assume you're there because I can't see the slide.,76,,
418,0.97,3630.96,3640.136,"There's a $2.7 million reduction in overtime, and this has to do with special events and emphasis patrols.",76,,
419,0.97,3640.136,3647.91,I believe the slide you're looking at is probably the overtime budget for SPD.,76,,
420,0.97,3647.91,3648.644,Is that the case?,76,,
421,0.97,3648.644,3657.687,"Sorry, yes, that's what the slide shows.",77,,
422,0.97,3657.687,3660.657,"Great, great.",78,,
423,0.97,3660.657,3672.668,"So then what we have is all the bureaus of SPD there, and then there's a last column.",78,,
424,0.97,3672.668,3674.504,I think that this is miscellaneous.,78,,
425,0.97,3674.504,3676.406,"Oh, I think I have it back.",78,,
426,0.97,3676.406,3677.407,Yes.,78,,
427,0.97,3677.407,3684.514,"So you see Seattle center events, sporting events, unusual occurrences, emphasis patrols, executive security, and youth deployment.",78,,
428,0.97,3684.514,3714.944,"The last several rows I just read out are all sub categories of the miscellaneous category, and the reason I highlight them is to show you that, um, the emphasis patrol row is zeroed out to let you know that the events, events at Seattle center and sporting events amounts are approximately 1.3 million lower than they would have been had the executive not made the reduction.",78,,
429,0.97,3717.046,3736.566,And what I think is important to recognize about the special events reduction is that it is based on the assumption that events will not happen at the same rate as the last years due to Covid.,78,,
430,0.97,3736.566,3740.169,So it becomes more of a technical reduction.,78,,
431,0.97,3740.169,3745.374,This is not an effort by the Department to shrink its Footprint at special events.,78,,
432,0.97,3745.374,3759.655,"In other words, it's not that the Department will deploy fewer people to events, when events start happening again, they'll deploy the same number of people and the same mix of people between Peos and officers.",78,,
433,0.97,3759.655,3768.097,Only the reason there's a reduction here is because of Covid.,78,,
434,0.97,3768.097,3779.308,"As you can see, SPD is planning on spending $5.8 million in general events, and those are largely events like fun runs, parades, neighborhood festivals.",78,,
435,0.97,3779.308,3785.681,You may be aware the cost of reimbursement on these kinds of events is not good.,78,,
436,0.97,3785.681,3795.892,A 2017 study by the auditor found the cost for permitted events ranged around 27%.,78,,
437,0.97,3795.892,3805.701,"This is in contrast to the cost recovery on sporting events, which for traffic reports is pretty much near cost recovery.",78,,
438,0.97,3805.701,3810.64,There are some sporting events that don't have good cost.,78,,
439,0.97,3810.64,3820.616,Those have to do with public safely patrols in Pioneer squares after the games or additional Dui patrols.,78,,
440,0.97,3820.616,3825.721,The Seahawks and other sporting teams don't pay for those.,78,,
441,0.97,3825.721,3833.963,That's a public safety function that is at the Department's expense.,78,,
442,0.97,3833.963,3860.957,Would point out that those reductions are made but that is what the Department needs due to Covid.,78,,
443,0.97,3860.957,3873.269,"There's a 1.4 million reduction of the 2.7 if the department had made a reduction, you'd see 1.4 million in the emphasis patrols.",78,,
444,0.97,3873.269,3885.915,You have the regular emphasis patrols that occur seasonally like the patrolling of Alki during the summer and the downtown patrols during the Christmas shopping season.,78,,
445,0.97,3885.915,3890.62,And then you have emphasis patrols done to reduce violence or gun crimes.,78,,
446,0.97,3890.62,3920.583,"Those kind of emphasis, the latter kind, the chief has indicated that he is going to continue to do as much as possible using what the Department calls direct patrol, which is basically a determine of bringing in 911 responders, having your 911 responders go to that area and spend additional time in the area on regular time.",78,,
447,0.97,3920.583,3934.83,So not any additional emphasis per say other than the 911 responders in that area would spend special attention on some areas that might have violent crime or gun crime.,78,,
448,0.97,3934.83,3950.112,Then I'd wrap up the section by just talking about emphasis patrol.,78,,
449,0.97,3950.112,3958.554,Advocates would say that helps prevent crime such as through community policing.,78,,
450,0.97,3958.554,3974.503,Opponents note that emphasis patrols show how Overpolicing target people of color and ultimate result is an entry into the criminal justice system that ruins lives and Perpetuates racism.,78,,
451,0.97,3974.503,3981.577,"Officers more regularly stop and draw their weapons on people of color, even though guns are more likely to be found on white people stopped.",78,,
452,0.97,3981.577,4005.735,"This data would seem to support a conclusion that emphasis patrols could Disproportionally draw people of color into the criminal justice system, so these are considerations the Department may have made and Council may make around whether or not emphasis patrols should be restored.",78,,
453,0.97,4005.735,4006.635,"Thank you, Greg.",79,,
454,0.97,4006.635,4007.336,Council member Morales?,79,,
455,0.97,4007.336,4008.637,Thank you.,80,,
456,0.97,4008.637,4029.759,"I'm glad to see there's zero line item for 2020, but as you said, it could mean that emphasis patrol is being done in a different way.",80,,
457,0.97,4029.759,4038.868,So I'm curious if you have data or the Department has data to help us understand what the outcomes were for 2019?,80,,
458,0.97,4038.868,4051.18,"As I understand, as you've indicated in your memo, um, we had 20,000 hours of overtime that paid $1.6 million last year just for the emphasis patrols.",80,,
459,0.97,4051.18,4065.694,I'd be very curious to hear the outcomes of that and would like to know what that bought us.,80,,
460,0.97,4065.694,4073.068,"If there's any information about, um, changed rates of crime or how to determine what was prevented, I would be very interested in hearing that.",80,,
461,0.97,4073.068,4080.709,"And the Department, um, has a lot of information on that.",81,,
462,0.97,4080.709,4087.283,They presented to the public safety Committe a number of output indicators.,81,,
463,0.97,4087.283,4097.426,"The number of folks contacted, the number of folks that were given infections, the number of folks that were contacted but not given Infractions.",81,,
464,0.97,4097.426,4122.151,I think you hit on the salient point which is what is the outcome.,81,,
465,0.97,4122.151,4125.721,"Yes, I'm interested in the outcomes we have for our neighbors.",82,,
466,0.97,4125.721,4128.657,"I'm happy to follow up with Dr. Fisher, thank you.",82,,
467,0.97,4128.657,4143.105,"And one more thing I'd add, the Department can also show crime changes over the course of the emphasis patrols and its Microcommunity crime reporting.",83,,
468,0.97,4143.105,4150.179,"But here again, it's difficult to draw a direct nexus.",83,,
469,0.97,4150.179,4153.749,That's something I'd leave to the public safety experts to talk about.,83,,
470,0.97,4153.749,4164.56,They might be able to more easily draw the nexus.,83,,
471,0.97,4164.56,4167.93,I have some options for this section --,83,,
472,0.97,4167.93,4168.497,One second.,84,,
473,0.97,4168.497,4170.065,I think Council member Herbold has a comment.,84,,
474,0.97,4170.065,4171.0,Thank you.,85,,
475,0.97,4171.0,4175.304,And it might be covered in one of the options.,85,,
476,0.97,4175.304,4183.746,"I have not memorized the memo as well as I should, I'm sorry.",85,,
477,0.97,4183.746,4196.692,"I'm confused a little bit about the about the size of the reduction in overtime for the year, the amount of time it's intended to cover.",85,,
478,0.97,4196.692,4220.316,"An under $3 million in reduction in overtime for the whole of 2021, um, how is it that we were able to get from the executive during our rebalancing an $8 million, um, overtime reduction for just a few months of 2020.",85,,
479,0.97,4220.316,4235.464,"It seems like if we were able to get 8 million out of four months of 2020, we should be able to get a bigger number than 2.7 out of all of 2021.",85,,
480,0.97,4235.464,4296.125,"Also, um, as it related to the decision, um, of chief Diaz to do the redeployment of officers in specialty units to patrol, sorry to go back to that issue, one of the other benefits that chief Diaz has said that, um, this Tsa transfer would accomplish is a further reduction of overtime, and I have asked for a projection or analysis that would show how many fewer hours of overtime we would anticipate for this transfer and have not yet received that information.",85,,
481,0.97,4296.125,4301.23,"Don't know if you have, Greg.",85,,
482,0.97,4301.23,4302.931,"I haven't, and I understand your point.",86,,
483,0.97,4302.931,4316.745,"It may be the Department is trying to reserve, um, to be conservative in its estimate in case events start up earlier, but you're right, they seem disproportionate.",86,,
484,0.97,4320.082,4323.552,"Okay, I'm not seeing additional questions.",87,,
485,0.97,4323.552,4323.752,Greg?,87,,
486,0.97,4323.752,4359.855,"Okay, so the options for this particular issue, um, consistent with the Council's option a, consistent with the Council's stated policy intent to reduce the size of the police force, further reduce SPD's overtime budget for special events either because of what Council member Herbold mentioned because there might be more room for reduction or because the Council might want to shrink the Footprint of the Department at special events, and then Lastly Maybe to improve cost recovery.",88,,
487,0.97,4359.855,4366.762,"Obviously, if there's fewer folks deployed, there's a good chance that cost recovery goes up.",88,,
488,0.97,4366.762,4382.144,"Option B would be to increase SPD's overtime budget for emphasis patrols to reinstate the seasonal patrols around Alki or downtown at Christmas or for targeted Anti-Violence and gun violence, and option C is no action.",88,,
489,0.97,4384.813,4392.788,"Okay, any questions?",89,,
490,0.97,4392.788,4393.522,Council member Herbold?,89,,
491,0.97,4393.522,4408.437,"Just flagging that, um, I do have a budget action that relates to Annualizing the Council's budget actions from 2020 and carrying them forward to 2021.",90,,
492,0.97,4408.437,4430.359,"It does not cover this issue of overtime because I don't think the Council took action on overtime, we didn't do further reductions because the executive had proposed a significant, I think satisfactory for that moment of time for the remainder of 2020.",90,,
493,0.97,4430.359,4445.24,I would like to look at what the assumptions were for 2020 and look at Annualizing the assumptions over 2021 to realize additional savings in the overtime budget.,90,,
494,0.97,4445.24,4455.517,"I would also like to find out from chief Diaz what his assumptions are, um, around the reduction in overtime associated with his transfers to patrol.",90,,
495,0.97,4457.386,4463.959,Thank you for flagging that.,91,,
496,0.97,4463.959,4475.704,I'm looking forward to that conversation as well about addressing overtime in general.,91,,
497,0.97,4475.704,4477.506,I don't have any about this issue.,92,,
498,0.97,4477.506,4489.985,"Let me say, the one you're using to address traffic office officers in a way that's triggering more overtime usage, I think that will be helpful.",93,,
499,0.97,4489.985,4490.519,Is that fair?,93,,
500,0.97,4490.519,4491.186,"Um, I'm not sure.",94,,
501,0.97,4491.186,4492.12,[Laughter],94,,
502,0.97,4492.12,4493.889,We'll get to it.,95,,
503,0.97,4493.889,4497.993,We'll talk about that after you see my form as.,96,,
504,0.97,4497.993,4499.862,Sound good.,97,,
505,0.97,4501.163,4507.536,So should I move on here to the 2020 Mid-Year reductions?,98,,
506,0.97,4507.536,4508.77,This is issue three.,98,,
507,0.97,4508.77,4517.246,And of course what you're seeing here is the table of personnel reductions that were made in July 2020.,98,,
508,0.97,4517.246,4522.05,The Council made approximately 3 million in reductions to the police Department's budget.,98,,
509,0.97,4522.05,4526.121,Some were Personnel-Related that you're seeing on the screen and some not.,98,,
510,0.97,4526.121,4539.835,Some reductions were made through direct cuts and others were made through Provisos that restricted APD's ability to spend appropriations without further authorization.,98,,
511,0.97,4539.835,4550.012,"Some Council members indicated the cuts may be annualized and continued in the 2021 budget, which is why I identified this as a particular issue.",98,,
512,0.97,4550.012,4564.593,"As part of the cuts in 2020, the Council expressed interest in eliminating 100 sworn positions through lay offs and target specific units or personnel, 38 positions in total.",98,,
513,0.97,4564.593,4571.4,"General lay offs into patrol or just in general, and those were 32 positions in total.",98,,
514,0.97,4571.4,4580.676,And the assumption that attrition would exceed executive projections for another 30 positions.,98,,
515,0.97,4580.676,4587.182,Obviously that last one has happened.,98,,
516,0.97,4587.182,4594.389,The 20 reductions were made via proviso that restricted further spending until Council makes authorization.,98,,
517,0.97,4594.389,4604.433,"The Council took that approach instead of a direct cut because the lay offs may not occur in 2020 due to timing and process considerations around lay offs, particularly around bargaining.",98,,
518,0.97,4604.433,4612.341,"As it turns out, this is exactly what happened, and the lay offs are not going to happen in 2020.",98,,
519,0.97,4612.341,4623.018,"Because the lay offs are not happening in 2020, the Mayor indicated it's her intent to transmit proposed legislation to lift the Provisos the Council put in place.",98,,
520,0.97,4623.018,4644.206,The value of the salary and benefits you see in the table is based upon the assumption that lay offs would be consistent with Pcsc rule 15A which is sort of the default when lay offs are made through reverse seniority order.,98,,
521,0.97,4644.206,4662.691,"However, the Council did preference or maybe a preference for, um, out of order lay offs, which is allowed by Pscs rule 15B allowing the chief to make out of order lay offs for reasons of efficient operations of the Department.",98,,
522,0.97,4662.691,4670.265,And that is reflected in the Provisos in bill 1825.,98,,
523,0.97,4670.265,4673.468,Other summer budget changes included more direct appropriation cuts.,98,,
524,0.97,4673.468,4687.682,"There was a cut to the recruitment initiative that included 200,000 for hiring bonuses that were in the 2021 budget that staff was told would not be needed until 2021.",98,,
525,0.97,4687.682,4697.292,"A $50,000 reduction to the Department's travel budget, a $345,000 reduction to command staff salaries or elsewhere.",98,,
526,0.97,4697.292,4702.431,The department could make that choice via a budget proviso.,98,,
527,0.97,4702.431,4717.112,"$80,000 reduction to free up funding for a green new deal oversight board, and then 378,000 to transfer the victim advocates from SPD to the human services Department.",98,,
528,0.97,4717.112,4725.987,"With that as a summary, I'll stop and go to the options and ask if there's any questions.",98,,
529,0.97,4725.987,4726.922,I'm not seeing any.,99,,
530,0.97,4726.922,4728.323,"Oh, council member Herbold, please go ahead.",99,,
531,0.97,4728.323,4737.232,"Sorry, I had to try and remember whether or not my question is relevant to 2021.",100,,
532,0.97,4737.232,4748.443,"My recollection is that for some of these specialty unit reductions, there were already vacancies in those units.",100,,
533,0.97,4748.443,4749.644,"Is that your recollection, Greg?",100,,
534,0.97,4749.644,4756.485,"Yes, there were already vacancies in some of the units.",101,,
535,0.97,4756.485,4758.887,"Yes, there were.",101,,
536,0.97,4758.887,4774.102,"These particular positions that were being reduced would cause lay offs, but there were already vacancies the department had allocated to quite a few of the units.",101,,
537,0.97,4774.102,4788.55,"So these reductions could cause lay offs, but could we as an alternative to that given that these units, many have vacancies, take the savings through the vacancies?",102,,
538,0.97,4788.55,4792.621,Or perhaps the budget already proposes to do that?,102,,
539,0.97,4792.621,4797.926,"Well, I think the latter is true.",103,,
540,0.97,4797.926,4816.411,The reason the lay offs were happening in 2020 instead of taking salary savings from the vacancies is because the Mayor had already reduced the savings from the salary vacancies as part of Covid% relief.,103,,
541,0.97,4816.411,4826.154,I believe the same is probably true here.,103,,
542,0.97,4826.154,4831.159,The sworn salary savings reduction is probably probably leave the Council limited in the same ways.,103,,
543,0.97,4831.159,4833.495,That's something I could find out more about.,103,,
544,0.97,4833.495,4836.264,But I would venture to see that's something you'd want to look into.,103,,
545,0.97,4836.264,4837.966,Thank you.,104,,
546,0.97,4844.506,4845.173,Thank you.,105,,
547,0.97,4845.173,4847.075,I'm not seeing additional questions.,105,,
548,0.97,4847.075,4854.95,"So Patty, go ahead and flip to the options slide if you would, please.",106,,
549,0.97,4854.95,4866.795,"Which is, again, these options are developed to assist the Council with the stated policy of reducing the size of the police Department.",106,,
550,0.97,4866.795,4873.868,"Option a, enacting cuts in the 2021 budget Mirroring the Mid-Summer budget.",106,,
551,0.97,4873.868,4887.882,"The first one being to cut the SPD budget with the assumption that attrition will occur, beyond what is proposed.",106,,
552,0.97,4887.882,4893.421,There's a cut without assuming any traditional attrition just because so many folks left in 2020.,106,,
553,0.97,4893.421,4900.462,"If the Council wanted to, they could assume traditional attrition and take more.",106,,
554,0.97,4900.462,4913.642,"Option two is more lay offs, that the lay offs sought in 2020 could be moved into 2021.",106,,
555,0.97,4913.642,4920.615,That can be done by specifying out of order lay offs or reverse seniority lay offs.,106,,
556,0.97,4920.615,4927.756,"Either way, staff would probably Reck meant a proviso as it would be difficult to determine how and when those would happen.",106,,
557,0.97,4927.756,4936.031,Option B is reducing the travel budget and professional services budget to Annualize or expand the cuts made in the summer.,106,,
558,0.97,4936.031,4943.772,Option C is reducing command staff salaries to Annualize the cut made in the summer.,106,,
559,0.97,4943.772,4949.377,Option D is no action.,106,,
560,0.97,4949.377,4951.279,"Council members, any comments about the options?",107,,
561,0.97,4951.279,4955.617,"Okay, seeing none for right now.",108,,
562,0.97,4955.617,4956.017,"Thank you, Greg.",108,,
563,0.97,4956.017,4963.291,"Well, I think that this is where I will turn it over to my colleague Lisa Kaye.",109,,
564,0.97,4963.291,4971.333,We'll walk you through some background and issues she's identifies on the 911 call center.,109,,
565,0.97,4971.333,4985.513,"Um, I might end by saying didn't mean to be evasive on whether or not the public safety goals that the Council is seeking to achieve could be met through the changes in the 2021 budget.",109,,
566,0.97,4985.513,5010.338,"I think that is something that the Mayor is looking to dig into with the task force she's putting together and how the Council wants to provide for that, whether they want to wait for the task force or make assumptions and start moving forward themselves is a policy call.",109,,
567,0.97,5010.338,5025.353,"Certainly it would be the Council's Purview to ask the chief to answer some of the questions about public safety, and I can seek answers from the chief about deployment and public safety, and hopefully provide you with some information.",109,,
568,0.97,5025.353,5027.355,With that I'd turn it over to Lisa.,109,,
569,0.97,5027.355,5032.727,"Just a quick question on that, and I defer to my colleagues tracking this issue more closely.",110,,
570,0.97,5032.727,5041.069,I thought that the earlier comments made about the task force was really about where the allocation of potential funding goes.,110,,
571,0.97,5041.069,5050.845,"There were the four buckets identified, and I think the question had been put to the committee members participants of the task force on how the dollars should be allocated.",110,,
572,0.97,5050.845,5054.182,It seemed like it was off the table where the reductions should come from.,110,,
573,0.97,5054.182,5057.652,Is that also part of what the task force is intended to look at at this point?,110,,
574,0.97,5057.652,5067.796,"Well, I don't know if the task force is intending to look at reductions per say.",111,,
575,0.97,5067.796,5076.204,I know they are interested in working more on what Dr. Fisher presented to you last summer.,111,,
576,0.97,5076.204,5084.179,That's what kind of calls could receive a different type of response than a police officer.,111,,
577,0.97,5084.179,5088.416,Much like what Council member Morales was saying during the issue identification section.,111,,
578,0.97,5088.416,5090.518,And really working to provide public safety services differently.,111,,
579,0.97,5090.518,5102.23,"I know that's a question the task force, one that the task force is looking at.",111,,
580,0.97,5102.23,5104.099,I know there's several.,111,,
581,0.97,5104.099,5105.4,That's something that's ongoing now.,111,,
582,0.97,5105.4,5107.836,"Thank you very much Greg, and we'll turn it over to Lisa.",112,,
583,0.97,5107.836,5109.971,"Thank you, can you hear me Council members?",113,,
584,0.97,5109.971,5120.114,"Yes, just try to speak up a little bit more, if you can.",114,,
585,0.97,5120.114,5122.75,"Okay, yes, I will.",115,,
586,0.97,5122.75,5123.351,"Thank you, Greg.",115,,
587,0.97,5123.351,5124.652,I'm Lisa Kaye with central staff.,115,,
588,0.97,5124.652,5129.424,I'll be talking to you first about the proposed new Seattle emergency communications center.,115,,
589,0.97,5129.424,5147.041,"As you can see on the slide, the proposed 2021 budget would transfer about $18.5 million in appropriations from the police 911 call center to a new Seattle emergency communications center.",115,,
590,0.97,5147.041,5158.653,"Council bill 119935 would create the new entity, and the 2021 budget ordinance itself would make the appropriation and position changes.",115,,
591,0.97,5158.653,5164.792,The Secc ordinance establishes the Mayor would propose and Council could confirm the director of the new center.,115,,
592,0.97,5164.792,5171.399,The ordinance States the transfer will begin once the city obtains a new originating agency identifying number from the Federal Government.,115,,
593,0.97,5171.399,5173.101,I think through the state.,115,,
594,0.97,5173.101,5179.607,It's required of all criminal justice agencies or agencies supporting a criminal justice agency.,115,,
595,0.97,5179.607,5190.518,"This means the transfer may not be effective exactly on January 1st, 2021 depending on how quickly the city receives this identifying number.",115,,
596,0.97,5190.518,5201.129,And working with legal staff about the proposed legislation needs a technical amendment to have the number before the center is further operational.,115,,
597,0.97,5201.129,5202.53,One second.,116,,
598,0.97,5202.53,5206.935,Let me do a sound check.,116,,
599,0.97,5206.935,5209.103,Can folks here Lisa okay?,116,,
600,0.97,5209.103,5209.604,Mixed response.,116,,
601,0.97,5209.604,5211.739,Just try to enunciate a little more.,116,,
602,0.97,5211.739,5214.742,There's a little bit of an echo.,116,,
603,0.97,5214.742,5215.176,Sorry about that.,116,,
604,0.97,5215.176,5222.15,"Yeah, I'm not using my optimal sound system, so I'm sorry.",117,,
605,0.97,5222.15,5223.351,That sounded a little better.,118,,
606,0.97,5223.351,5226.387,"Okay, well, I will try to enunciate.",119,,
607,0.97,5226.387,5227.922,That helps.,119,,
608,0.97,5227.922,5237.165,I have flagged one potential policy issue for your consideration.,119,,
609,0.97,5237.165,5237.865,"Next slide, please, Patty.",119,,
610,0.97,5237.865,5250.244,"With your permission, I'll provide a little bit of context for the issue of economies of scale for the 911 dispatch center.",119,,
611,0.97,5250.244,5255.984,Seattle currently has two dispatch centers known as public safety answering points or Psaps.,119,,
612,0.97,5255.984,5259.554,One is within Seattle police and one is within Seattle fire.,119,,
613,0.97,5259.554,5274.602,"The police Department's call center is the primary call center that means all calls within the city of Seattle go first to SPD, and if an emergency requires a fire of medical response, SPD forwards that call to the Seattle fire Department.",119,,
614,0.97,5274.602,5284.312,The city's two dispatch centers are actually part of a county-wide 911 system that includes a total of 12 public safety answering points or Psaps.,119,,
615,0.97,5284.312,5292.52,"Seattle, a few years ago, participated in creating a regional 911 strategic plan published in December of 2017.",119,,
616,0.97,5292.52,5305.133,It sound the regional system is facing significant fiscal challenges in adapting the system to next generation technology.,119,,
617,0.97,5305.133,5311.239,So both the state and the county have periodically discussed consolidating the Psaps.,119,,
618,0.97,5311.239,5314.242,Those discussions have been relatively controversial with different parties.,119,,
619,0.97,5314.242,5331.159,I would note that the Mayor has asked her new interdepartmental team for community safety to make recommendations about a long term vision of creating a Unitied emergency communications dispatch and informational referral center.,119,,
620,0.97,5331.159,5340.835,The options shown here on the slide you're seeing would provide a more definitive Timeline for consideration of the issue.,119,,
621,0.97,5340.835,5359.32,Option a would simply require a report back by a certain date on potential economies of scale and other cost benefits associated with either Emergencying or Colocating the SPD dispatch centers in the independent new communications center.,119,,
622,0.97,5359.32,5374.769,"Option B would go a step farther and require the executive to establish a date certain or by a date certain, a Timeline by which the two call centers would be Colocated or merged.",119,,
623,0.97,5374.769,5380.708,And option C would adopt the ordinance as proposed.,119,,
624,0.97,5380.708,5386.914,There's one budget action submitted relative to this legislation from Council member Herbold.,119,,
625,0.97,5386.914,5398.559,"I think you talked about it during the presentation this morning, which would expand the function and Renaming the Seattle emergency communications center by adding parking enforcement officers.",119,,
626,0.97,5398.559,5403.598,"Thank you, Lisa.",120,,
627,0.97,5403.598,5404.766,I'm just checking here.,120,,
628,0.97,5404.766,5406.534,Council member Mosqueda stepped away.,120,,
629,0.97,5406.534,5417.945,Does anyone have a question or comment around issue four?,120,,
630,0.97,5417.945,5421.449,I'm Scrolling through and not seeing any raised hands.,120,,
631,0.97,5421.449,5428.856,"I would just like to flag my interest in, um, in one of these options.",120,,
632,0.97,5428.856,5431.759,I'm not quite sure which yet.,120,,
633,0.97,5431.759,5450.111,"I think the question of potential economies of scale is a good one and not something I thought of myself, so thank you Lisa, and I'll get back to you about which of these options, a or B look better.",120,,
634,0.97,5455.416,5459.987,Would you like me to proceed to issue five which is office of emergency management?,121,,
635,0.97,5459.987,5461.088,Please do.,122,,
636,0.97,5461.088,5463.991,And there are no form as on this.,123,,
637,0.97,5470.898,5477.471,So I'll be very quick on what my analysis turned up here.,123,,
638,0.97,5477.471,5493.988,"So as you are aware, the 2021 budget would transfer about $2.5 million, again, and 15 Ftes from the Seattle police Department to create an independent office of emergency management within the executive branch.",123,,
639,0.97,5493.988,5501.596,Council bill 119933 would create the independent office and the 2020 budget ordinance would make the appropriation and position changes.,123,,
640,0.97,5501.596,5507.835,The Mayor would propose and the Council would confirm the director.,123,,
641,0.97,5507.835,5520.414,"That position has been vacant since a resignation about a year ago, and the executive anticipates filling that position by the end of this year.",123,,
642,0.97,5520.414,5529.724,The options on the next slide would align the new ordinance with municipal code language.,123,,
643,0.97,5529.724,5535.229,I'll do this quickly for your future consideration.,123,,
644,0.97,5535.229,5543.738,Option a would address the office of statutory authority for specific areas and remove reference to internal operating policies.,123,,
645,0.97,5543.738,5554.382,"So, um, it would maintain, so basically it's realigning the new ordinance with the existing municipal code language.",123,,
646,0.97,5554.382,5560.688,"This amendment, if you chose option a, would maintain Council review and approval over the comprehensive emergency management plan.",123,,
647,0.97,5560.688,5563.991,"It currently comes to Council, but wouldn't under the new ordinance.",123,,
648,0.97,5563.991,5569.564,It would maintain an annual report to Council on activity in the emergency management sub Fund.,123,,
649,0.97,5569.564,5575.002,That's where you'll see a lot of State and Federal grants we get pertaining to emergency management.,123,,
650,0.97,5575.002,5586.614,And it would do a little bit of housekeeping on cleaning up language around hazard mitigation and training functions.,123,,
651,0.97,5586.614,5602.43,"Option B is basically the same as option a, but would keep in the language that the Department or the office asked to have that requires compliance with the emergency management accreditation program standards.",123,,
652,0.97,5602.43,5622.617,"Oem was the first Northwest city to get this accreditation, but the Department recommended keeping internal policies such as compliance with external accreditation standards out of the code so you don't have to update the code as frequently when standards change by some other entity.",123,,
653,0.97,5622.617,5626.12,"So, and then option C would pass the ordinance as proposed.",123,,
654,0.97,5626.12,5633.527,"I'll be happy to take any questions, but that's all I have.",123,,
655,0.97,5633.527,5641.268,"There was some interest in the independent, to ensure Greatr independence, any comments here?",124,,
656,0.97,5641.268,5644.605,Council member Herbold?,124,,
657,0.97,5644.605,5691.886,"Just want to say that I defer to Lisa's, um, good advice on the amendments necessary to the proposed ordinance to make sure that, um, OEM is able to continue operating as envisioned with the high level of accreditation it receives and would definitely support amendments that would accomplish that.",125,,
658,0.97,5691.886,5697.324,"Okay, I'm not seeing any other hands.",126,,
659,0.97,5697.324,5700.261,There were no budget actions proposed relevant to OEM.,127,,
660,0.97,5700.261,5709.37,I think it might go back to Greg at this point if there's more discussion on budget actions for SPD.,127,,
661,0.97,5709.37,5710.171,Thank you very much.,128,,
662,0.97,5710.171,5719.046,"So before I get going, I want to clarify.",129,,
663,0.97,5719.046,5722.55,"Council member Mosqueda, Madam chair, you were right.",129,,
664,0.97,5722.55,5726.053,I misspoke when I spoke about the task force about Reimagining public safety.,129,,
665,0.97,5726.053,5743.037,"It's not the task force, it's the community safety work group that's looking at, um, Reimagining public safety and determining how officers get deployed and to what calls.",129,,
666,0.97,5743.037,5745.539,"I messed up the name there, so I apologize.",129,,
667,0.97,5745.539,5746.64,That's okay.,130,,
668,0.97,5746.64,5755.983,There's a lot of floating bodies with new names out there.,130,,
669,0.97,5755.983,5759.286,The community safety work group is that also the interdepartmental task force?,130,,
670,0.97,5759.286,5765.259,"I think so, but I don't want to get myself in more trouble.",131,,
671,0.97,5765.259,5771.432,"Okay, I see Council member Morales maybe has, do you have clarification on that?",132,,
672,0.97,5771.432,5772.9,They're two separate entities.,133,,
673,0.97,5772.9,5773.2,Okay.,134,,
674,0.97,5773.2,5774.135,If I understand correctly.,135,,
675,0.97,5774.135,5792.019,"So as we move forward, we may want to do Matrix to show the various entities, I know Council President Gonzalez was also thinking through some Matrixes as well.",136,,
676,0.97,5792.019,5795.956,So we'll endeavor to help clarify this.,136,,
677,0.97,5795.956,5802.83,And my colleague tomorrow has a Matrix put together showing the task forces and breaks it down for Council members.,137,,
678,0.97,5802.83,5805.599,I'm not just remembering it at the moment.,137,,
679,0.97,5805.599,5807.301,But she has that ready for you tomorrow.,137,,
680,0.97,5807.301,5808.802,We appreciate it.,138,,
681,0.97,5808.802,5813.707,Thank you for helping to offer that clarification this afternoon.,138,,
682,0.97,5813.707,5817.411,"Okay, let's get into the fun part here.",138,,
683,0.97,5817.411,5828.055,"Walking through the various, um, budget actions, statements of legislative intent.",138,,
684,0.97,5828.055,5829.256,Is that where we're at?,138,,
685,0.97,5829.256,5829.623,Page 16?,138,,
686,0.97,5829.623,5843.47,"So page 16 of the central staff memo, if folks are following along in their budget packets with that information or for the viewing public, that's the slide that corresponds with where we're at.",138,,
687,0.97,5843.47,5847.575,"Patty, if you'd flip to the next slide please.",139,,
688,0.97,5847.575,5855.082,So SPD overtime spending by Council member Herbold.,139,,
689,0.97,5855.082,5869.563,"And just for speed here, I'll read the title, and if there's a summary that makes sense, I'll go over it, but we'll probably turn it over to Council members to summarize their own proposals.",139,,
690,0.97,5869.563,5870.397,So Council member Herbold?,139,,
691,0.97,5870.397,5873.2,"Yes, this is just a reporting action.",140,,
692,0.97,5873.2,5878.072,It just asks that SPD report on overtime spending to Council on a monthly basis.,140,,
693,0.97,5878.072,5885.613,It doesn't get to the issue we talked about earlier which is actually seeking a further reduction.,140,,
694,0.97,5885.613,5916.744,"But still, this is, I think, um, important moving forward as a way of highlighting the Council's interests in having some certainty that the executive is working to get better controls over time, consistent with the 2016 city auditor recommendations.",140,,
695,0.97,5916.744,5921.148,"The number three is--Oh, I'm sorry, questions?",141,,
696,0.97,5921.148,5923.317,"I don't see any, thanks.",142,,
697,0.97,5923.317,5932.059,"So number three, reduction in SPD vacancies and unfilled positions is a Misprint on behalf of staff.",143,,
698,0.97,5932.059,5938.666,"Council member Herbold has expressed intent to reduce vacancies, but the narrative here does not match.",143,,
699,0.97,5938.666,5943.17,"So I'll let her Express her intent, and we'll seek to correct the record with an updated staff report.",143,,
700,0.97,5946.006,5946.674,Sounds good.,144,,
701,0.97,5946.674,5947.975,Council member Herbold?,144,,
702,0.97,5947.975,5991.719,"So Yeah, this proposal is accurate in every way except for, um, in the narrative description in the memo it suggests that I'm uninterested in capturing the funding behind these vacant positions that we would also Abrogate, so I'm interested not only in Abrogating the 16 vacant positions and 17 unfunded vacant position, but I'm also interested in capturing the funding related to those positions.",145,,
703,0.97,5991.719,6053.18,"But again, given the Reck in addition that, um, the total position funding and authority in the 2021 proposed budget is likely to be a mismatch, um, given the recent reductions in staff, the separations in 2020 and the fact that they are unlikely to be able to fill the positions that are in the 2021 proposed budget, I might want to consider scrapping this proposal for the option that Greg recommends because it accomplishes, I think, this, what the goal is in budget action three plus more.",145,,
704,0.97,6053.18,6058.752,"Excellent, thank you very much.",146,,
705,0.97,6058.752,6059.686,Questions on that?,146,,
706,0.97,6059.686,6061.588,Okay.,146,,
707,0.97,6061.588,6067.261,So number four is increasing the OPA's independence via a proviso.,147,,
708,0.97,6067.261,6080.207,"It would transfer, seek to transfer the OPA out of the Seattle police Department and that's brought by Council member Pederson.",147,,
709,0.97,6080.207,6081.408,Thank you.,148,,
710,0.97,6081.408,6097.591,"As you know, we have a relatively new police accountability system that's been dramatically tested and stretched during the racial reckoning and protests following the wrongful killing of George Floyd and countless other black, indigenous, and people of color.",148,,
711,0.97,6097.591,6103.33,"As we know, this accountability system includes the community police Commission, the office of Inspector general, and the office of police accountability.",148,,
712,0.97,6103.33,6111.839,One of the concerns I've heard expressed recently is that OPA while run by civilians is still housed within the Seattle police Department.,148,,
713,0.97,6111.839,6121.048,So this budget action tries to take steps toward making OPA fully independent.,148,,
714,0.97,6121.048,6135.963,"So while work needs to be done overall on the police contract with the Seattle police officer's Guild, pushing forward to make OPA fully independent from the police Department will help to improve, build upon those reforms already in place.",148,,
715,0.97,6135.963,6145.839,"Because OPA investigates potential police misconduct and allegations have increased during the recent protest, the idea is to spur this action.",148,,
716,0.97,6145.839,6163.19,"I would look to central staff to recommend how best to recommend, what budget tools we have, a statement of intent or budget proviso to see this happens soon so we know the full steps required to make OPA independent.",148,,
717,0.97,6163.19,6182.109,"I understand one of the concerns, one of the reasons it's housed within the police Department is to have IMI Nstant access to the data, but there must be a way to give them greater independence, but also access to that data.",148,,
718,0.97,6182.109,6183.41,"Okay, questions?",149,,
719,0.97,6183.41,6184.311,Council member Herbold?,150,,
720,0.97,6184.311,6208.235,I just want to flag that this was an idea that the Mayor raised when we first started talking at Reenvisions public safety and having a conversation about which units were appropriate to transfer out of SPD.,151,,
721,0.97,6208.235,6223.85,The Mayor had in early days identified OPA as one such entity that might be best served being transferred out of SPD.,151,,
722,0.97,6223.85,6233.126,"There was a lot of concern from the director about that, and that's part of, I believe, why that hasn't happened.",151,,
723,0.97,6233.126,6265.659,"And I just really encourage I conversation with director Myerburg about the purpose of being, sort of, not literally housed, but organizationally under SPD and the difficulty that might provide in the short term whereas maybe perhaps over a longer term period it might be a good thing to do.",151,,
724,0.97,6265.659,6269.83,"But if you're talking about a proviso, that's.",151,,
725,0.97,6269.83,6278.105,"Um, you know, obvious something that is implemented in a way that's punitive until the objective is accomplished.",151,,
726,0.97,6278.105,6287.28,So I'd be really worried about using that as the mechanism.,151,,
727,0.97,6287.28,6289.616,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",152,,
728,0.97,6289.616,6299.993,"As chair of the public safety Committee, I'd defer to your wisdom on this and work with Greg to Reframe it as a slide and get more information to move forward.",152,,
729,0.97,6299.993,6305.565,"I think that would be fantastic, thank you.",153,,
730,0.97,6305.565,6309.202,Let's move to item number five.,154,,
731,0.97,6309.202,6315.842,That's report on using Nonspd officers for special event traffic control.,155,,
732,0.97,6315.842,6334.761,"As many Council members know, parking enforcement officers are used in some situations in traffic control and other situations specifically that where lights are being redirected.",155,,
733,0.97,6334.761,6342.235,"This particular proposal would seek to identify the cost savings if Peos were used instead of officers, if I said that right Council member Pederson.",155,,
734,0.97,6342.235,6342.703,"Thank you, Greg.",156,,
735,0.97,6342.703,6350.41,This is the one I think I was getting confused with Council member Herbold.,156,,
736,0.97,6350.41,6355.482,"Council member Pederson, help us understand more.",156,,
737,0.97,6355.482,6358.452,I think there is some common ground with Council member Herbold.,157,,
738,0.97,6358.452,6361.154,I think she's seeking to do even more.,157,,
739,0.97,6361.154,6368.662,"Some of the form as, we put them together not having the benefit of talking to all eight of our colleagues beforehand.",157,,
740,0.97,6368.662,6371.898,So this is common ground with Council member Herbold.,157,,
741,0.97,6371.898,6384.211,Also I think Greg's chart where he talks about the overtime costs and how he filled in some of the information with what's reimbursed and what's not.,157,,
742,0.97,6384.211,6389.783,Really this is just meant to be useful.,157,,
743,0.97,6389.783,6394.688,Can we find ways to save money.,157,,
744,0.97,6394.688,6402.596,Will we be saving money by having these professionals go from the police Department or Sdot or what Council member Herbold is suggesting.,157,,
745,0.97,6402.596,6409.035,I'm trying to determine a way to save money to take the money and we deploy it to the community.,157,,
746,0.97,6409.035,6427.387,"So Greg, looking to you, if you think that's going to be useful to help us how much money we could save, we can proceed with this, otherwise I can just defer to Council member Herbold's option.",157,,
747,0.97,6427.387,6441.067,"Council member Herbold, do you have anything else to add to that?",158,,
748,0.97,6441.067,6481.808,"Um, so I think Council member Pederson's correct in that I am looking not only to hopefully get savings related to Peos doing this work, but I think it's beyond, um, there's this question of traffic control when there's a traffic control device and when there's not a traffic control device.",159,,
749,0.97,6481.808,6488.248,"And this is probably, I'm getting myself in trouble by trying to remember the differences here.",159,,
750,0.97,6488.248,6498.925,But there's a question of whether or not Peos can be flag Gers in both instance.,159,,
751,0.97,6498.925,6511.438,Both when there's a traffic control device and when it's a free intersection.,159,,
752,0.97,6511.438,6533.059,"But I'm definitely supportive of getting a report, but I'm also interested in figuring out what we need to do to authorize Peos to do this work for special events in both instances.",159,,
753,0.97,6533.059,6555.649,"I know there's a piece of legislation related to this issue, and I'm just, as I mentioned earlier, interested to know whether or not we can either under the current title or by reintroducing with the new title work to broaden the authorization for Peos to do this kind of work in more instances.",159,,
754,0.97,6557.918,6560.287,Any comments Council member Pederson?,160,,
755,0.97,6560.287,6563.323,I'll work with Greg Doss on this.,161,,
756,0.97,6563.323,6566.693,Basically just wanted to be a useful tool to see where we can save money.,161,,
757,0.97,6566.693,6575.268,"This seemed to be some lower hanging fruit on how to save money and deploy, redeploy to community.",161,,
758,0.97,6575.268,6578.939,Sot I'll talk with Greg off line whether we can combine it with another report we're getting or not.,161,,
759,0.97,6581.741,6582.208,Great.,162,,
760,0.97,6582.208,6594.888,"And I'll just add to that to the extent that, um, we're able to just act upon it without a report, that's something I'm also interested in.",162,,
761,0.97,6594.888,6596.289,"Okay, let's go ahead.",162,,
762,0.97,6596.289,6597.691,Item number six.,162,,
763,0.97,6597.691,6598.925,Thank you.,163,,
764,0.97,6598.925,6622.916,"Item number six is impact on response times by Council member Pederson, a proposal that would request a report on response times after unexpected officer attrition in 2020 and 2021, and relative to changes in the fourth quarter of this year.",163,,
765,0.97,6622.916,6626.052,"Thank you, council member Pederson?",164,,
766,0.97,6626.052,6626.82,Thank you.,165,,
767,0.97,6626.82,6642.669,"This report is consistent with the information we asked for when we passed 119825, but that bill just applies to reporting in 2020, so this is additional reporting through 2021 on predicted impacts to response times.",165,,
768,0.97,6642.669,6676.87,"But focusing on just the priority one and priority two calls, um, I agree with my colleagues earlier who were noting you really don't need to measure the response time to lower priority calls.",165,,
769,0.97,6676.87,6681.374,"I think the 7 minute response time shouldn't be for lower, right Greg?",165,,
770,0.97,6681.374,6686.413,I think it's actually more like 9 minutes.,166,,
771,0.97,6686.413,6686.88,It's in the Appendix.,166,,
772,0.97,6686.88,6706.533,I just think we can continue to benefit from information on response times to priority one and two calls as we see the police force numbers and patrol changing over time.,167,,
773,0.97,6706.533,6708.301,I'm not seeing additional hands.,168,,
774,0.97,6708.301,6710.637,"Oh, council member Herbold, go ahead?",168,,
775,0.97,6710.637,6713.306,"Okay, I'll go ahead.",168,,
776,0.97,6713.306,6720.18,I would like to explore with you the concept of evaluating how many of these calls could be handled by a consulting nurse.,168,,
777,0.97,6720.18,6755.348,"I know in the past I understand from the Council President as wells this is an issue that's been put forward at various points, but it seems like with the data we now have and the lived experience of members the health one, and I think, you know, a reckoning, a reawakening of how we can better utilize our public services and respond to public safety matters, maybe there's more interest now in determines how these calls could be handled by a nurse on the other end of the phone versus sending someone.",168,,
778,0.97,6755.348,6758.451,Is that something you'd be interested in adding to the report as well?,168,,
779,0.97,6758.451,6759.185,Absolutely.,169,,
780,0.97,6759.185,6761.387,Great.,170,,
781,0.97,6761.387,6764.357,"Council member Herbold, please go ahead.",170,,
782,0.97,6764.357,6767.494,Thank you.,171,,
783,0.97,6767.494,6768.995,"Um, two things.",171,,
784,0.97,6768.995,6785.378,"One, as it relates to the number of reports we requested as part of our, the Council bill, I can't remember the number, but that we passed during rebalancing.",171,,
785,0.97,6785.378,6843.937,"We do have a request in to SPD through share point whether or not they intend to respond to those reports, and it may, I understand this is, you're focused on 2021, but it may, if they are working on those reports, it may, um, make it not as necessary, but this is definitely information we have to have in order to begin taking steps on this transition, and I am feeling very anxious about the fact that it doesn't appear that any work is being done on this area of the Council's stated interest.",171,,
786,0.97,6843.937,6888.881,"I also want to flag that, um, Uh, as it relates to the fire Department's expansion of health one, I think it would be really important for us to get, if we don't already have it, an estimate from police and fire whether or not they anticipate a further reduction in the need for response to 911 calls that would accompany the Mayor's proposed expansion of health one to add a second team.",171,,
787,0.97,6888.881,6930.323,"As we're thinking of things we want to do to reduce the reliance on the police Department to respond to SPD, 911 calls, we should also be thinking about, you know, again, what systems we already have in place to take some of these calls, whether or not it is, um, a system that's Alreadying Alreadying hooked up to 911 like health one or folks who have ability to do crisis response but are not hooked up to the system.",171,,
788,0.97,6930.323,6942.735,This is an area so critical for us to do analysis and proposing solutions on now.,171,,
789,0.97,6942.735,6949.609,I'm just hoping we don't find ourselves halfway into the year next year and still not having the answers to some of these questions.,171,,
790,0.97,6949.609,6951.544,You raised a really important point.,172,,
791,0.97,6951.544,6954.681,We've asked a number of these questions already.,172,,
792,0.97,6954.681,6974.0,We really need this data to be able to both invest appropriately and ensure that we're responding to the public's concern about both public safety and making sure the right folks are showing up when 911 is called.,172,,
793,0.97,6974.0,6976.069,"Central staff, can you elaborate on that?",172,,
794,0.97,6976.069,6983.643,Is there any indication the executive is responding to the requests and do we have any update on when we can anticipate that information?,172,,
795,0.97,6983.643,6984.777,Because Council member Herbold is correct.,172,,
796,0.97,6984.777,6988.481,We have to have it to move forward.,172,,
797,0.97,6988.481,6992.218,Council member Pederson's piece is absolutely right.,172,,
798,0.97,6992.218,6995.188,"We want the answers, but we've made the requests before.",172,,
799,0.97,6995.188,7008.134,I would ask Greg to respond if he has any information about whether or not he has heard if the executive is intending to respond to these specific report requests.,173,,
800,0.97,7008.134,7020.546,"I'll just NOTE in general, because of the veto action and then the vote to override the veto, the actual effective date of the legislation where these reports were requested is October 22nd.",173,,
801,0.97,7020.546,7036.929,"So I think it is an open question in a general way of whether or not they will be fulfilling that request, and Greg may have additional information if he's in more direct contact with the departments and with the budget office analysts who staff these departments.",173,,
802,0.97,7036.929,7048.541,"I will also just note, in terms of making a request for a slide, if they do respond in a more timely manner, may not be necessary.",173,,
803,0.97,7048.541,7068.628,"The Council through the budget adopts statements of legislative intent and affirms the requests by resolution in the following year, and we welcome an opportunity to reduce the number of requests on that list when we adopt that resolution, so there would be an opportunity to eliminate them if they're no longer necessary, which would be a happy outcome.",173,,
804,0.97,7071.931,7103.496,"In following up to what Aly said, what I've heard from the executive from CBO is that they are taking the work of, um, many of those reports, specifically finding the alternative public safety responses and rolling that into, let's see if I got it right now, I think it's the Idt work that's supporting the community safety work group.",174,,
805,0.97,7103.496,7106.632,They're rolling it into that process.,174,,
806,0.97,7106.632,7113.439,That's what I heard in terms of their efforts around that work.,174,,
807,0.97,7113.439,7117.343,"Yeah, and so, Aly, I missed a little of what you're saying.",175,,
808,0.97,7117.343,7125.952,You're saying one of the reports isn't due into October 20 something?,175,,
809,0.97,7125.952,7128.054,Thanks for the question.,176,,
810,0.97,7128.054,7149.175,"I was saying the legislation that included this request doesn't technically go into effect until October 22nd, so it's a little awkward because the dates for the requested reports sort of precede, come before when the bill goes into effect --",176,,
811,0.97,7149.175,7157.583,"Yeah, I remember one of the reports that I'm thinking of, it may be this one, is due on September 30th, or was due on September 30th.",177,,
812,0.97,7157.583,7163.756,So we know we didn't get that one.,177,,
813,0.97,7163.756,7187.38,"And I also remember hearing, um, director noble, saying the work would be rolled into in Idt, so what are your options, central staff, when Council is asking for analysis and work to be done, and we're asking according to, in a way, Legislatively, right?",177,,
814,0.97,7187.38,7188.981,"And in this case, via ordinance.",177,,
815,0.97,7188.981,7194.72,"And we have the executive saying no, we're not going to do that.",177,,
816,0.97,7194.72,7200.026,We're going to roll it out on our own Timeline through our own process.,177,,
817,0.97,7200.026,7210.269,"I just don't know what other options we have under that scenario because it doesn't Aline with, um, um, with how we want to move this work forward.",177,,
818,0.97,7211.971,7216.909,"Aly, I don't know if you want to respond to that, but there's other options to that.",178,,
819,0.97,7216.909,7230.856,"You made the request in the legislation that becomes effective on the 22nd, and Council member, I believe some of the reports that you're talking about were due on the 15th, so we know we didn't get those either.",178,,
820,0.97,7230.856,7240.333,"In terms of other options that the Council might have to make a stronger request via proviso or other action, council staff can advice you on that.",178,,
821,0.97,7240.333,7240.7,Thank you.,179,,
822,0.97,7244.904,7246.973,"Very important, thank you.",180,,
823,0.97,7246.973,7259.952,It also makes it more important that we understand how all these requests already in statute are filtering into the proposed Matrix that we'll hopefully have a visual of soon.,180,,
824,0.97,7259.952,7286.345,"And again, back to this item number six here, wanting to make sure that we also keep our finger on the, sorry, keep pushing on the need to have this information if it needs to remain in this budget for us to potentially take out early next year.",180,,
825,0.97,7286.345,7307.8,This is a good reminder of what we've already put into statute and what we expect in terms of report backs and thank you for working with the colleagues here to further identify how we can push to get that information.,180,,
826,0.97,7307.8,7308.267,"Okay, number seven.",180,,
827,0.97,7308.267,7317.443,This is reducing cost in the Seattle police officer's Guild contract.,181,,
828,0.97,7317.443,7324.283,"Costs specifically associated with salary, premium pays, and specialty pays brought by Council member Pederson.",181,,
829,0.97,7329.789,7334.827,Thank you.,182,,
830,0.97,7334.827,7336.629,The thanks chairman Mosqueda.,182,,
831,0.97,7336.629,7341.067,"This one is, um, basically we're in budget season, so we're talking about dollars here.",182,,
832,0.97,7341.067,7366.292,"I think it will be a benefit to the public and policy makers to quantify and shine a light on the most expensive cost drivers in the current contract with the police Union, Sump as excessive overtime, extra pay to wear body cameras, generous vacations, taxpayer contributions to the union's deferred COMP program.",182,,
833,0.97,7366.292,7382.408,"Just Quantifying and Daylighting, you know, when you look at the hundred page contract, it's hard to know how much each one costs, what's really driving the excessive cost from the contract.",182,,
834,0.97,7382.408,7412.438,"I think to be sensitive to the comments raised from earlier this morning, I'd probably Reword this so it's really, instead of looking where to reduce the cost, it would just be Quantifying the different cost drivers within the contracts as sort of a neutral look at the contract and where it's costing the most money on each of the line items.",182,,
835,0.97,7412.438,7415.808,And this would be a statement of legislative intent.,182,,
836,0.97,7415.808,7423.849,Thank you for that clarification.,183,,
837,0.97,7423.849,7424.35,Any questions?,183,,
838,0.97,7424.35,7425.551,I'm not seeing any.,183,,
839,0.97,7425.551,7428.32,Looking forward to hearing more on this item.,183,,
840,0.97,7428.32,7435.427,"Before we move on, I think we may have skipped over number one, and it could have been part of Lisa's summary, and I missed it.",183,,
841,0.97,7435.427,7448.14,"But just for the purposes of transparency with the public and with us, can we go back to item number one which is expand the function in Renaming the Seattle communications center?",183,,
842,0.97,7448.14,7453.179,"Council member Herbold, sounds self-explanatory, but wanted to give you a chance to address it as well.",183,,
843,0.97,7453.179,7461.287,"Lisa, I'm sorry if you already included that in your summary, but let's do that real quick.",183,,
844,0.97,7461.287,7462.788,Thank you.,184,,
845,0.97,7462.788,7467.493,"So you did talk about this, um, a little bit at the Sdot meeting this morning.",184,,
846,0.97,7467.493,7474.9,It would expand the function of and rename the Seattle emergency communications center.,184,,
847,0.97,7474.9,7481.974,It would add parking enforcement officers and rename the emergency communications center the Seattle community safety and communications center.,184,,
848,0.97,7481.974,7482.775,Thank you.,185,,
849,0.97,7482.775,7484.51,"Council member Herbold, anything to add?",185,,
850,0.97,7484.51,7487.012,"Yeah, thank you so much.",186,,
851,0.97,7487.012,7492.952,We did talk about this a bit during the Sdot presentation this morning.,186,,
852,0.97,7492.952,7508.601,"I identified at that time the number of functions that the police officer's Guild, I'm sorry, the parking enforcement officer's Guild is interested in taking on that would require bargaining.",186,,
853,0.97,7508.601,7521.213,I think the one point I'd like to take the opportunity to highlight now relates specifically to the name change.,186,,
854,0.97,7521.213,7567.059,"If we are looking at fulfilling the request of the parking enforcement officers to not be transferred to Sdot, but instead to be transferred to the new Department, then if that's the case, if we do take that action as a Council, that Department should not be named Seattle emergency communications center because by moving the parking enforcement officers, I believe it makes, to that Department, it's broader than emergency communications.",186,,
855,0.97,7567.059,7568.56,Thank you for that summary.,187,,
856,0.97,7568.56,7569.395,Any questions?,187,,
857,0.97,7569.395,7570.93,"Okay, thanks so much, folks.",187,,
858,0.97,7570.93,7573.399,I appreciate you going back to that.,187,,
859,0.97,7573.399,7580.005,"Council member Herbold, I appreciate you putting that on our radar.",187,,
860,0.97,7580.005,7581.006,Let's resume number 8.,187,,
861,0.97,7581.006,7584.209,"For the viewing public, we're on slide 17.",187,,
862,0.97,7584.209,7588.581,"I'm sorry, page 17 in the memo, slide 24.",187,,
863,0.97,7588.581,7592.017,"All right, thank you Council member.",188,,
864,0.97,7592.017,7608.701,"Number eight is reducing SPD's budget, specifically overtime personnel or other discretionary expenditures to invest in Bipoc communities, and it's brought by Council member Morales.",188,,
865,0.97,7608.701,7611.604,"Thank you, Greg and chair Mosqueda.",189,,
866,0.97,7611.604,7623.048,I want to preface this by saying I am interested in working with Council member Herbold to find ways to reduce staffing and work with her on her form as.,189,,
867,0.97,7623.048,7635.127,"I think it's really important if we want to decrease police violence, which is what all the these protests have been about, we need to reduce contacts with police.",189,,
868,0.97,7635.127,7641.467,That's why we are ending police roll on the NAV team.,189,,
869,0.97,7641.467,7646.739,That's why we're investing in programs like community Passageways and choose 180.,189,,
870,0.97,7646.739,7661.987,"Given the research that decreasing contact between the public and the police is the best way to reduce police violence, given that most of the 911 calls that are made are in fact not for crimes but for nuisance calls and things like that.",189,,
871,0.97,7661.987,7671.296,And that we can't really demonstrate that random patrols actually prevent crime or protect the public.,189,,
872,0.97,7671.296,7681.54,I'm not inclined to Prioritize maintaining a staffing level based on what seems like arbitrary Metrics.,189,,
873,0.97,7681.54,7692.384,And we know most of us have made a commitment to reduce the size of the force and the budget by 50%.,189,,
874,0.97,7692.384,7716.308,"So I'm interested in working with my colleagues to get us there, and I've been working with King County equity now and other groups to develop a plan for the budget process, and I'm happy to answer questions or work with my colleagues who want to make sure we move that forward well.",189,,

882,0.97,7749.975,7753.145,"Council member Sawant, please go ahead.",192,,
883,0.97,7753.145,7754.146,Thank you.,193,,
884,0.97,7754.146,7764.123,This budget amendment would move the community service program as Greg said out of the police Department and into the Department of neighborhoods.,193,,
885,0.97,7764.123,7769.795,Just want to remind Council members that community service officers are not police officers.,193,,
886,0.97,7769.795,7790.282,"They do not carry wins, and as we know, there are many questions that police are sent to where a social would be far more effective and Non-Harmful, and the community service officer's program tries to pilot that approach.",193,,
887,0.97,7790.282,7821.747,"The community service officers themselves, with many of whom have discussed personally with my office, they are dedicated members of the community who do extremely good work, but they have determined that operating under the command structure of the police Department has made it far more difficult for them to serve their communities, and they're requesting to moved out of police Department and into the Department of neighborhoods, which is what this budget amendment would do.",193,,
888,0.97,7821.747,7826.485,"Thank you, council member Sawant.",194,,
889,0.97,7826.485,7827.319,Any questions?,194,,

893,0.97,7831.123,7834.459,I appreciate Council member Sawant bringing this forward.,197,,
894,0.97,7834.459,7842.768,Have you discussed this at all with the teamsters who organize the community service officers?,197,,
895,0.97,7842.768,7848.774,"I know they've been interested in pursuing a place to move the Csos too, and I think this is an intriguing option.",197,,
896,0.97,7848.774,7859.751,I'm just curious when you said they've been getting organized if that was potentially a reference to talking to the teamsters about this as well?,197,,
897,0.97,7859.751,7865.891,"I think, yes, thank you for bringing that up Council member Lewis.",198,,
898,0.97,7865.891,7891.516,"I will update Council members in a future Committee, but my understanding is that it does not, when I say organized, it does not only imply they've been talking to the Teamsters, which I know they have, but also they've been talking amongst one another and getting organized amongst themselves, and as a group they've been talking to my office.",198,,
899,0.97,7891.516,7901.593,I know my staff has been reaching out to them to see how involved they have and how we can proceed on this matter.,198,,

901,0.97,7904.93,7905.764,I'm not seeing additional questions.,199,,
902,0.97,7905.764,7912.704,"Council member Herbold, did you have anything on this?",199,,
903,0.97,7912.704,7924.416,"Yeah, I would definitely be interested to benefit with the conversations you've been having with CSO employees.",200,,
904,0.97,7924.416,7932.224,This is the first full year they've been working for the city since it was Reinstituted.,200,,
905,0.97,7932.224,7953.445,"I'm not committed to them being housed at SPD, and if they have concerns about from where they're deployed and think another Department would be a better fit, I would welcome the chance to benefit from those conversations as well.",200,,

907,0.97,7958.85,7987.479,"I totally agree that I think the Council will, as a whole, benefit from having more information, and I will absolutely make sure that we share, at least on E-mail, if we don't have a chance immediately tomorrow to come back to this given other agenda items, I will make sure we share all of this on E-mail, and I welcome your staff members or yourselves in the discussion.",201,,
908,0.97,7987.479,7987.846,Thank you.,202,,
909,0.97,7987.846,7992.017,Any additional comments on this?,202,,
910,0.97,7992.017,7993.151,Let's move on to item number 10.,202,,
911,0.97,7993.151,8001.86,Item number 10 is transferring some of the harbor patrol functions to the Seattle fire Department and it's brought by Council member Herbold.,203,,
912,0.97,8001.86,8002.627,Please go ahead.,204,,
913,0.97,8002.627,8005.263,Thank you.,205,,
914,0.97,8005.263,8017.709,"I'm just, I was just trying to track down what the resolution 31962 said.",205,,
915,0.97,8017.709,8023.949,I don't want to get the cart before the horse.,205,,
916,0.97,8023.949,8028.42,I'm interested in determining what functions might be able to be to be transferred.,205,,
917,0.97,8028.42,8031.523,I'm not necessarily assuming that those functions can be transferred.,205,,
918,0.97,8031.523,8056.314,"I've been told that there's a lot of overlap, and I've also been told there's an Moa that defines what the fire Department and the police Department do as it relates to responding to emergencies in the water.",205,,
919,0.97,8056.314,8068.193,"So in the next Iteration of this, I want to make sure we speak to this understanding that there's an Moa that would probably have to come first.",205,,
920,0.97,8068.193,8098.123,"If Greg agrees that my recollection is correct, that the last time this issue came up, there was a lot of controversy about it and rather than making the decision, rather than the policy makers making the decisions, everybody sat down at a table and figured out who would do what.",205,,
921,0.97,8098.123,8122.247,"After many years since that agreement was negotiated, again, I'm hearing that there's a need to return to that agreement because there's a duplication of activities and things the fire Department is doing, I'm sorry, things the police Department is doing that would be better for fire to do.",205,,
922,0.97,8122.247,8143.168,"Council member Herbold, you asked me to weigh in and say yes there's an Mou that defines roles, I think it's specifically around divers, but maybe some other things too.",206,,
923,0.97,8143.168,8151.543,"And, um, as this is drafted now, I think it assumes a lot more simplicity than is possible.",207,,
924,0.97,8151.543,8153.778,Is that direct?,207,,
925,0.97,8153.778,8162.754,We can't just transfer harbor Department in our budget ire action.,207,,
926,0.97,8162.754,8169.761,"That would be, again, something that, some of it would have to be negotiated as part of the Mou and some would have been bargained, is that correct?",207,,
927,0.97,8169.761,8171.162,"Yeah, that's true.",208,,
928,0.97,8171.162,8184.576,"Any time there's a body of work owned by one Union that would potentially move to another, it needs to be negotiated.",208,,
929,0.97,8184.576,8185.71,Thank you.,209,,
930,0.97,8185.71,8188.313,"Council member Pederson, please go ahead.",210,,
931,0.97,8188.313,8196.087,I just want to thank Council member Herbold for being sensitive to the past situations with this.,211,,
932,0.97,8196.087,8203.094,"In my ride along with harbor patrol, part of it is the geography where harbor patrol is more in Lake Union and Lake Washington.",211,,
933,0.97,8203.094,8210.602,"I think the fire Department, you probably see them a lot more in Elliott Bay and West Seattle.",211,,
934,0.97,8210.602,8228.119,"So it's, um, you know, I'm not sure there would be any, I'd be curious as to what the cost savings would be because right now you don't have a fire Department on Lake Union, but you have the police Department there.",211,,
935,0.97,8228.119,8240.265,"If you're just moving a department there, I don't know, I'd be curious about the benefits of that, so I look forward to learning more.",211,,
936,0.97,8240.265,8241.866,"Great, thank you.",212,,
937,0.97,8241.866,8245.67,And I also appreciate you bringing this up Council member Herbold.,212,,
938,0.97,8245.67,8262.587,One of the things I want to look into as this item potentially moves forward is how we ensure safety for onshore activity that's only accessed from the water.,212,,
939,0.97,8262.587,8264.889,That's the biggest area of concern from the Maritime industry.,212,,
940,0.97,8264.889,8267.859,I appreciate you bringing this forward and look forward to earning more.,212,,
941,0.97,8267.859,8272.197,I know this is an area of interest to many Council members.,212,,
942,0.97,8272.197,8273.865,"Council member Strauss, did you have something as well?",212,,
943,0.97,8273.865,8274.199,Please go ahead.,212,,
944,0.97,8277.135,8277.869,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",213,,
945,0.97,8277.869,8291.449,Thank you Council member Herbold and Pederson and Greg for bringing this forward.,213,,
946,0.97,8291.449,8323.682,"I think one point to note that's very important to me is currently harbor patrol has a Proactive patrolling of our fresh waters, and that would be something that I would like to continue to see if it was transferred to another Department, understanding that there are, I think it will be important to understand what level of patrol is needed by sworn officers compared to medical professionals regarding dive teams, et cetera.",213,,
947,0.97,8323.682,8328.453,"There's a lot to unpack here, and I look forward to learning more.",213,,
948,0.97,8328.453,8335.66,"All right, I think we're on number 11.",214,,
949,0.97,8335.66,8337.662,"Right, number 11.",215,,
950,0.97,8337.662,8340.532,Defunding SPD's budget by 50% brought by Council member Sawant.,215,,
951,0.97,8340.532,8341.866,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",216,,
952,0.97,8341.866,8358.083,"This is the budget amendment to Defund the police by 50% as 7 of the 9 Council members, including myself, promised to do earlier this summer during the height of the justice for George Floyd movement.",216,,
953,0.97,8358.083,8370.562,"Throughout this, the Mayor has done massive cuts to other departments, including lay offs, and there's no legal reason that continue be done in the police Department instead of the other departments.",216,,
954,0.97,8370.562,8387.512,"Reducing the funding and there have the size of the police Department would mean the police wouldn't have the resources to continue to Overstaff and abuse black lives matter protests, not to mention the chronic targeting they do of homeless neighbors.",216,,
955,0.97,8387.512,8394.919,"They'd have less time to harass communities of color as a whole, but still have a massive $180 million left over for their budget.",216,,
956,0.97,8394.919,8402.827,"I want to be clear that when genuine community organizers Demanned to Defund the police, this is what they were talking about.",216,,
957,0.97,8402.827,8408.533,Actually reducing the forces of oppression in society.,216,,
958,0.97,8408.533,8412.904,That's different from many of the accounting gimmicks the Mayor's office has used.,216,,
959,0.97,8412.904,8420.712,There's tens of millions of dollars transferred out of the police Department into other departmental budgets with no tangible change in real terms.,216,,
960,0.97,8420.712,8424.249,That's not what the community is talking about.,216,,
961,0.97,8424.249,8431.322,"There's also some genuine reductions in police spending, partially because of the impact of the movement.",216,,
962,0.97,8431.322,8438.663,"However, the genuine reductions are far, far from 50%.",216,,
963,0.97,8438.663,8466.291,"To calculate what's needed to Defund the police, we took last year's budget and adjusted for technical adjustments and accounted for the transfers to other departments and divided the remainder in half, subtracted the genuine reductions in the Mayor's police budget, and what is left is the 170 million odd dollars that still need to be Defunded, which is what this budget amendment would do.",216,,
964,0.97,8466.291,8469.794,That's of course a lot of calculations to describe verbally.,216,,
965,0.97,8469.794,8502.06,"I'll be happy to share the work sheets my office produced with any interested, but I think it's essential we understand the reason this is so complicated is because of the layering and other accounting tricks used to try to deflect thousands of people have real lip understanding what the budget represents and we're talking about tens of thousands of people in the city that are still, who still come into public testimony demanding the Defunding of the SPD.",216,,
966,0.97,8502.06,8517.442,Council members have a real option to follow through on the commitment expressed to Defund oppressive policing and instead put the funds in genuinely Uplifting our communities.,216,,
967,0.97,8517.442,8547.071,"Over the summer, we heard many things from Council that it's complicated and would take months to Defund the police, and I said at the time that was an excuse in my view, but regardless, now it is very simple, and it's been months since the promises were made, and I would really urge Council members to co-sponsor this and vote in favor of this amendment and sort of understand that this is not a technical question, but it's a question of whether politically we want to do this or not.",216,,
968,0.97,8549.407,8553.778,Thank you Council member Sawant.,217,,
969,0.97,8553.778,8556.314,Any additional comments or questions?,217,,
970,0.97,8556.314,8559.484,Council member Herbold.,217,,
971,0.97,8559.484,8567.158,"I just remember from the 2020 rebalancing exercise, well, it was more than an exercise, it was a vote.",218,,
972,0.97,8567.158,8584.909,"That central staff did some analysis around what a 50% cut would be, and I think it would have, it would result in, um, a reduction in something like 700 officers, does that --",218,,
973,0.97,8584.909,8593.484,"Yeah, I don't remember the exact number, but it was many hundreds, Yeah.",219,,
974,0.97,8593.484,8607.031,"And would a 50% reduction in testimony July have the same relative, same impact as a 50% cut in an annual budget at the beginning of the year?",220,,
975,0.97,8607.031,8609.2,Still would be around that same number of officers?,220,,
976,0.97,8609.2,8619.043,"It would have a different, it would have a different impact, um, but it would be obviously drastic.",221,,
977,0.97,8619.043,8634.559,"You've got right now, um, just under 1400 FTE and 384 civilians, so you can imagine a 50% reduction, given the personnel costs that I talked about at the front of the presentation, Yeah, hundreds.",221,,
978,0.97,8634.559,8659.183,"And can you speak to the, um, the risks of making this size of a cut without Bargainling it and spending those Dollarsin a higher priority area that the Council might identify?",222,,
979,0.97,8659.183,8670.361,"Well, I think as central staff noted last summer that the, that any lay off would require bargaining whether it's impact or decision bargaining.",223,,
980,0.97,8670.361,8700.124,It would be the case that an attempt by the Council to cut the dollars and niche wait lay offs might be a problem later if the Union wind up challenging those lay offs and can successfully challenge it to the point where the funding could be realized in the 2021 budget.,223,,
981,0.97,8700.124,8706.898,It would essentially mean that the Council would have to come back and fix to whole so to speak.,223,,
982,0.97,8706.898,8708.7,So that would be the primary risk associated.,223,,
983,0.97,8708.7,8721.913,"So having, in the case of this proposal, having to fund an additional $173 million?",224,,
984,0.97,8721.913,8723.047,Potentially depending on --,225,,
985,0.97,8723.047,8724.348,170.3.,226,,
986,0.97,8724.348,8724.582,Yeah.,226,,
987,0.97,8724.582,8745.169,"And I think this issue, to be fair to Council member Sawant, I think this is an issue that might impact, um, many different variations of, um, of decisions that we might consider making around staffing reductions.",226,,
988,0.97,8745.169,8761.219,"But Greg, can you speak briefly to the issue that's been raised around the consent decree and the monitor's position on staffing cuts?",226,,
989,0.97,8761.219,8791.048,I think the only thing that I'm comfortable saying on that is that the monitor has suggested that staffing cuts be reviewed by DOJ to make sure that they would not put the Department in a position where it was out of compliance with any of the particular DOJ mandates around things like span of control and other Staffing-Based requirement.,227,,
990,0.97,8791.048,8791.415,Thank you.,228,,
991,0.97,8791.415,8803.528,"Council member, thank you for your questions, council member Sawant, to close us out on this item, would you like to add any additional comments?",229,,
992,0.97,8803.528,8814.639,"Yeah, just to say that Yeah, the estimate Greg had around 700 is accurate because it's 1400 odd officers.",230,,
993,0.97,8814.639,8837.628,"And I would just also take attention back to one of the graphs Greg had of which we've known for awhile that over 80% of the budget is salaries and overtime, so it has to come from this source otherwise technically it's not possible to do Defunding.",230,,
994,0.97,8837.628,8861.519,"And the whole point is reducing contact between police officers and community members and that social workers and nurses, as you said chair Mosqueda, and others should be performing many of those duties to reduce tremendous harm, including loss of life as we've seen for eight people, actually under Mayor Durkan's reign when they come into contact with the police.",230,,
995,0.97,8861.519,8883.741,"I think from everything we've seen, and the largest ever Street protest in U.S. history with over 20 million people going out in justice for George Floyd, this is the theme, and not a single city has delivered on this actually despite many, um, many politicians making promises.",230,,
996,0.97,8883.741,8889.513,"But as far as the bargaining is concerned, of course we're not saying we shouldn't be bargaining.",230,,
997,0.97,8889.513,8892.183,"That's a necessary process, of course.",230,,
998,0.97,8892.183,8923.681,"But the city, as the legislative body has budgeting authority, and we've had these discussions before, and I would just also had one last point as a member of a labor union myself that absolutely the right of every Union to bargain for the best possible outcomes of living standards if were their members is something that I will always fight for, but at the same time we have to understand that the police Union has not played the same rules as labor unions in general.",230,,
999,0.97,8923.681,8926.717,Injury to one is an injury to all.,230,,
1000,0.97,8926.717,8942.433,"That's the philosophy on which the labor movement is based on, and that was the underlying analysis through which the Mlk labor Council members voted to remove the Seattle police officer's Guild from the labor Council.",230,,
1001,0.97,8942.433,8961.952,"Not because they don't think they have the right to be a Union, but because the way the police officer's Guild has reacted and been an obstacle to real police reform.",230,,
1002,0.97,8961.952,8967.959,We have budgeting authority and should take that authority and doing and bargain the effects.,230,,
1003,0.97,8967.959,8973.264,"Okay, thank you very much.",231,,
1004,0.97,8973.264,8981.706,I want to keep us moving along.,231,,

1006,0.97,8982.139,8986.711,If we spent 3 minutes on each of the remaining items we should end right on time.,231,,

1011,0.97,9013.504,9014.872,I'll save you 3 minutes.,233,,
1012,0.97,9014.872,9016.941,Any questions?,234,,
1013,0.97,9016.941,9017.341,Okay.,234,,
1014,0.97,9017.341,9018.042,Let's keep going then.,234,,
1015,0.97,9018.042,9019.543,Number 13.,234,,
1016,0.97,9019.543,9040.364,Number 13 is transferring the SPD performance ANALYTICS and research unit from the SPD to the inspector general for public safety brought by Council member Gonzalez.,235,,
1017,0.97,9040.364,9044.468,Anything to add to these?,236,,
1018,0.97,9044.468,9089.58,"Just really quickly, um, the performance ANALYTICS and research unit is one that really focuses on much of the research that drives many of the, um, policing strategies and public safety strategies at the Seattle police Department, so this particular item is, I think, consistent with other proposals and actions to transfer various units out of the Seattle police Department, and this proposal would place the highly Analytical research par unit into the office of public safety.",237,,
1019,0.97,9089.58,9106.931,The mission and skill set of the par unit closely lines with the functions of the IG which is why I'm proposing this possible transfer.,237,,
1020,0.97,9106.931,9125.716,"We're exploring the logistical implications, but based on the substantive body of work of this unit, I think it would be, um, productive for us to per sue this potential unit under the leadership and supervision of the office of Inspector general.",237,,
1021,0.97,9125.716,9153.944,"I would say that in a form B context, we're looking at potentially revising this to allow for the opportunity to perhaps make this a Function-Based transfer as opposed to a complete 100% unit transfer, so it might make sense to leave some of these functions within the Seattle police Department in acknowledgment that accountability is important within the Department, not just outside the Department.",237,,
1022,0.97,9153.944,9162.086,And still sort of create a Pathway for some of the if functions to transfer to Oig.,237,,
1023,0.97,9162.086,9164.255,Thank you.,237,,
1024,0.97,9164.255,9165.556,"Thank you, Madam President.",238,,
1025,0.97,9165.556,9166.757,Any questions on this?,238,,
1026,0.97,9166.757,9167.291,No questions.,238,,
1027,0.97,9167.291,9169.894,Thank you for flagging the possible change in the form B.,238,,
1028,0.97,9169.894,9176.4,Looking forward to hearing more about that item as it evolves.,238,,
1029,0.97,9176.4,9178.202,Appreciate it.,238,,
1030,0.97,9178.202,9179.67,"Council members, we're on item number 14, page 18 of the memo.",238,,
1031,0.97,9182.94,9203.06,"Item number 14 is eliminating the unfunded sworn positions brought by Council President Gonzalez, and you'll recall that at the top of the presentation, I mentioned that there are 50 remaining unfunded positions that are not needed in the 2021 staffing plan.",239,,
1032,0.97,9203.06,9206.197,This proposal would aggregate those positions.,239,,
1033,0.97,9206.197,9209.633,Thank you very much.,240,,
1034,0.97,9209.633,9211.135,"Council President, Gonzalez, any additional comment?",240,,
1035,0.97,9211.135,9215.039,"No, I think Greg covered it really well.",241,,

1037,0.97,9217.308,9218.976,"All right, any further questions?",242,,
1038,0.97,9218.976,9221.445,"Great, let's go to number 15.",242,,
1039,0.97,9221.445,9227.318,Number 15 is eliminating the funded sworn positions unneeded in the SPD staffing plan.,243,,
1040,0.97,9227.318,9245.336,"You'll recall that earlier in the presentation I talked about in the 2021 budget there are 1400 Ftes funded and it's not expected, according to the staffing plan that SPD will be able to fill all those positions.",243,,
1041,0.97,9245.336,9253.21,This proposal would reduce the positions that they could not fill.,243,,
1042,0.97,9253.21,9254.945,Brought by Council President Gonzalez.,243,,

1045,0.97,9263.487,9268.659,Any questions on comments from our colleagues?,246,,
1046,0.97,9268.659,9273.697,"Okay, seeing none.",246,,
1047,0.97,9273.697,9279.903,"All right, let's move on to item number, 16.",246,,
1048,0.97,9279.903,9291.882,16 is prohibiting SPD from removing Encampments unless certain conditions are satisfied brought by Council member Sawant.,247,,
1049,0.97,9291.882,9293.817,"Council member Sawant, please go ahead.",248,,
1050,0.97,9293.817,9338.896,This would place a proviso on the budget of the Seattle police Department that no funds in the Seattle police Department budget can be used for unauthorized use of the encampment until all have accepted housing or moved to a location no farther than half a mile away where they can establish unauthorized encampment with no harm to themselves or others directed to this location during a previous encampment removal.,249,,
1051,0.97,9338.896,9356.58,"So in other words, this budget amendment is intended to work in conjunction with the budget amendments to remove resources away from the navigation team, homeless outreach and services.",249,,
1052,0.97,9356.58,9362.786,"For years, the people's budget movement has been demanded an end to inhuman and ineffective Sweeps of homeless people.",249,,
1053,0.97,9362.786,9368.792,We're seeing more and more people understanding that this is not working and it's inhumane on top of that.,249,,
1054,0.97,9368.792,9375.799,"The Sweeps don't help people find housing, and in reality have a terrible track record of even getting people into shelter.",249,,
1055,0.97,9375.799,9381.405,We have seen this over and over again in endless presentations.,249,,
1056,0.97,9381.405,9389.513,"Overwhelmingly the Sweeps move people from one street corner to the next, only to become more desperate.",249,,
1057,0.97,9389.513,9399.59,"I remember Testifying in public comment, a man said he'd been swept eight times that year with no solution to his condition.",249,,
1058,0.97,9399.59,9412.636,"The Mayor's office paints a picture of a team that helps Houseless people move off the streets, but that's far from what actually happens.",249,,
1059,0.97,9412.636,9418.675,"Many times the Sweeps don't include a navigation team, the police have make people move along.",249,,
1060,0.97,9418.675,9439.863,"If a police Officertells someone they have to move along, then they can't have their tent somewhere, they must offer another location nearby that's less harmful, Safeful for the resident and less of an impediment to traffic and so on.",249,,
1061,0.97,9439.863,9447.638,This doesn't mean giving a flier for a shelter that may not even have an open bed.,249,,
1062,0.97,9447.638,9450.374,This means concrete solutions.,249,,
1063,0.97,9450.374,9454.645,This is about harm reduction.,249,,
1064,0.97,9454.645,9459.716,We need tiny House villages and other services better for people to sleep unsheltered.,249,,
1065,0.97,9459.716,9473.43,"While we work to expand affordable housing and interim solutions, we also need a humane policy with regard to Sweeps and we need to have the city stop causing harm.",249,,
1066,0.97,9473.43,9478.235,We can focus the city's resources on actually providing housing and services.,249,,
1067,0.97,9480.804,9487.11,Thank you Council member Sawant.,250,,
1068,0.97,9487.11,9489.88,Any questions or comments?,250,,
1069,0.97,9489.88,9491.915,"Council member, just a few questions for clarification.",250,,
1070,0.97,9491.915,9506.129,"I think that the language you have outlined here is a helpful example of the situations in which individuals may be asked to move, but the conditions under which those individuals would have the authority to ask people to move.",250,,
1071,0.97,9506.129,9508.265,I think you outlined it well.,250,,
1072,0.97,9508.265,9517.941,I think this helps get at the question folks have asked about what about issues where there's an unsafe area or a true hazard.,250,,
1073,0.97,9517.941,9525.849,Could you comment about how this language helps address those two concerns brought up?,250,,
1074,0.97,9525.849,9552.876,"I think that's a very important point, and I feel that's language that needs to be added to the existing language in this proviso because we have tried to incorporate all conditions, but maybe just add hazardous locations or if you have suggestive language we can add, we're happy to add to it.",251,,
1075,0.97,9552.876,9579.77,"But the main thing is what we attempt to do with this proviso language is take into account there are real situations where it's not ideal for our homeless neighbors to be situated in wherever they're situated whether it's harmful to themselves or other community members and overall a question of public safety, but that it can't be done in such a way that people are just moved and Shunted from one spot to another with no solutions and futures.",251,,
1076,0.97,9579.77,9590.614,"So we feel that this language, if it is fully Encapsulating the conditions as you highlighted, it will be something that's useful.",251,,
1077,0.97,9590.614,9596.987,"If you are open to it, I'd like to work with you on just making sure we include all the language necessary.",251,,
1078,0.97,9596.987,9604.227,"Thank you, and thanks for offering that clarification.",252,,
1079,0.97,9604.227,9606.93,Any additional questions or comments?,252,,
1080,0.97,9606.93,9607.13,Okay.,252,,
1081,0.97,9607.13,9610.233,"Last three items here, folks.",252,,
1082,0.97,9610.233,9614.738,"We are doing well on time, so item number 17.",252,,
1083,0.97,9614.738,9620.544,Item number 17 is a proposal that the fire Department snuck into the police paper.,253,,
1084,0.97,9620.544,9622.646,I'm just kidding.,253,,
1085,0.97,9622.646,9632.656,"This is a proposal that Council member Herbold brought forward during the fire issue paper, and it's one that staff inadvertently left out.",253,,
1086,0.97,9632.656,9640.998,It's the reinstatement of Council funding that would reverse the cut of fire exams and reverse the cut of 20 firefighters from the Sfd recruit class.,253,,
1087,0.97,9644.201,9657.848,"I guess this is, getting on the record Council member Herbold's proposal and apologies by staff that it wasn't in the fire paper.",253,,
1088,0.97,9657.848,9668.692,"We already talked about it during the fire presentation because Greg was so helpful in making sure there was a presentation slide for this even though it didn't get in the paper, so thank you.",254,,
1089,0.97,9668.692,9669.393,That's right.,255,,
1090,0.97,9669.393,9669.693,Thank you.,255,,
1091,0.97,9669.693,9679.369,"I appreciate you bringing this forward as we talked about before, and thanks Greg for making sure it was reflected in the materials for Recordkeeping purposes.",255,,
1092,0.97,9679.369,9684.207,"All right, last two are from our Council President.",255,,
1093,0.97,9684.207,9695.519,"Item 18 is adding funding, potentially adding funding or FTE to expand the office of the Oig if needed to audit the new public safety entities as we've talked about.",256,,
1094,0.97,9695.519,9719.176,"There were functions of SPD, public safety functions moved into other departments or established just their own entity, and this proposal would look at whether additional funding are needed to fulfill the Oig's mission to audit public safety functions being performed by city entities.",256,,
1095,0.97,9719.176,9719.943,Council President Gonzalez.,256,,
1096,0.97,9719.943,9720.977,Thank you very much.,257,,
1097,0.97,9720.977,9731.955,"Greg covered it, nothing to add.",258,,
1098,0.97,9731.955,9732.456,"Great, thank you.",259,,
1099,0.97,9732.456,9735.258,"Any questions, colleagues?",259,,
1100,0.97,9735.258,9736.86,"All right, seeing none.",259,,
1101,0.97,9736.86,9739.229,"And the last one, number 19.",259,,
1102,0.97,9739.229,9752.075,Last one is a potential proviso on SPD's 2021 budget to ensure that officers are receiving training on how to appropriately engage with sex workers.,260,,
1103,0.97,9752.075,9769.459,"There was in the 2020 budget a $200,000 proviso for this kind of training and staff haven't yet been able to determine whether this training was delivered.",260,,
1104,0.97,9769.459,9782.405,"I think this particular proposal was in advance of, to make sure the training is being delivered if not in 2020, but 2021.",260,,
1105,0.97,9782.405,9783.607,Hopefully I said that right.,260,,
1106,0.97,9783.607,9787.043,"Council President, anything to add?",261,,
1107,0.97,9787.043,9817.14,"Just really quickly, consistent with what Greg said, I understand these funds were cut in the rebalancing of the 2020 budget, and I still remain interested in this body of work and I also remain interested in potential intersection of the ongoing discussions with the King County jail for jail services and how that will be Reassessed and the funds are to be used moving forward.",262,,
1108,0.97,9817.14,9845.569,"And I just appreciate being able to make sure we don't lose sight of this body of work that was really important to the Council last year, and if those dollars are, um, haven't been used and we track them down, I think there's an opportunity for Council to either encourage the training as we envisioned or to capture the dollars as savings to fund Council priorities.",262,,
1109,0.97,9845.569,9850.54,"Thank you very much, Council President.",263,,
1110,0.97,9850.54,9852.576,"Any questions or comments, colleagues?",263,,
1111,0.97,9852.576,9853.944,I will make a quick comment.,263,,
1112,0.97,9853.944,9870.56,"I really appreciate you flagging both that it's a question about whether or not the dollars have been used and whether or not that training has occurred, and also the continued interest in ensuring this type of engagement and retraining happens with officers.",263,,
1113,0.97,9870.56,9892.082,"For folks who weren't on Council, it was a pretty telling moment late last year when we had a presentation from members of the police Department and ways many members in the community would have wished the engagement was done differently.",263,,
1114,0.97,9892.082,9909.432,"I'm also concerned this hasn't been deployed, or if it has, that's good, but if not, let's continue to keep up our pressure about making sure this type of training or similar work occurs in the future.",263,,
1115,0.97,9909.432,9915.739,Thank you for flagging this.,263,,
1116,0.97,9915.739,9917.507,"Greg, anything else to add?",263,,
1117,0.97,9917.507,9918.008,Nothing.,264,,
1118,0.97,9918.008,9921.344,I am very appreciative of all your time this afternoon.,265,,
1119,0.97,9921.344,9927.45,Greg walked us through almost three hours of a presentation.,265,,

1121,0.97,9933.723,9942.666,"Obviously there are many form a ideas not put forward, and thank you for all the issues you identified that didn't correspond did certain areas.",265,,
1122,0.97,9942.666,9955.178,"We'll go back and look at all the issues central staff have identified, and we look forward to working with all of you on this important component of our budget given the large dollar figure and the community call for action on this.",265,,
1123,0.97,9955.178,9959.783,Any additional comments for the good of the order on this?,265,,
1124,0.97,9959.783,9963.386,I'm seeing none from our central staff.,265,,
