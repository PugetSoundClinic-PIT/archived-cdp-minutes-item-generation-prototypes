22,0.97,79.279,82.982,"Gen., as well.",6,,
23,0.97,82.982,95.762,We like many cities across the state are dealing with the impact of Covid-19 which has meant we've had to radically change how we address general governing and dealing with the crisis that has come up because of the public health crisis that is coated.,6,,
24,0.97,95.762,104.504,We initially had had conversations during the previous month about ways in which the previous budget and revenue streams could be addressed for greater support.,6,,
25,0.97,104.504,122.188,Those in our community from small businesses to Childcare to individual workers and folks from communities like in immigrant and refugee communities.,6,,

27,0.97,139.439,149.749,We really appreciate his leadership on everything he has been doing with our public health Department and local government to respond to the crisis.,6,,
28,0.97,149.749,158.525,Their directives earlier this month have allowed us to continue the conversation which we much appreciate.,6,,
29,0.97,158.525,159.859,There are 3 items on the agenda.,6,,
30,0.97,159.859,166.466,"We will address the revenue bills we were previously discussing introduced by Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Sawant that we will take up . hello, Councilmember Sawant, Inc.",6,,
31,0.97,166.466,173.973,You for joining us.,6,,
32,0.97,173.973,177.844,We will have those as agenda items 1-2-3. agenda item number 4 we talked in detail about on Monday.,6,,
33,0.97,177.844,191.157,This is the beginning part of the evaluation of the current budget and setting us up for conversations on the future budget including the 2020 supplemental budget to help deal with the crisis that is Covid and immediate concerns in our community.,6,,
34,0.97,191.157,209.375,"We will also use this as an opportunity to do an inquest into the Seattle police Department budget so we have a better understanding of where current spending is occurring, where Thse dollars are going, and who they are serving and not serving so that we can have an assessment of where we would like dollars to go in the future.",6,,
35,0.97,209.375,223.723,"This is in alignment with much of the conversations that are happening in places like Minneapolis, New York City, Los Angeles, and many CDs across the country doing similar analyses on how to Defund and refund community priorities.",6,,

38,0.97,246.012,271.07,I'm hopeful they are not only using this as an opportunity to include spending items from the Federal and state government to address the Covid crisis but to also take the moment to address the other public health crisis that is out there which is the institutionalized racism in the concerns that we see about over policing or escalating police tactics in our community.,6,,
39,0.97,271.07,277.543,I see this as a good sign that there is additional conversation happening about the budget.,6,,

56,0.97,411.611,424.223,"In fact, I want to remind folks that as we begin committee meetings, a reminder we will have public comment probably not as long as today but every meeting, so that people have the chance to share the input.",8,,

94,0.97,659.358,672.438,I think we are seeing a lot of radical sounding promises and it's really important we don't just rely on the same political establishment that got us here.,11,,
95,0.97,672.438,694.994,"Protesters for Seattle police to eat leave the precinct, a number of democratic establishment politicians have consistently voted in support of more police funding, voted against legislation, except for Kshama Sawant who voted against it in the past.",11,,

103,0.97,735.601,746.145,They weapon ice black peers against them.,13,,

114,0.97,806.505,816.215,Seattle citizens no longer feel SPD serves the city and are ready to have a conversation about how to address public safety in a way that Harmonizes law enforcement with the community and propose a replacement agency be designed via a citizens Assembly in each district.,15,,
115,0.97,816.215,824.723,Each district would convene in an assembly that would conduct hearing and deliberate to produce a proposal.,15,,
116,0.97,824.723,829.628,Proposals will be voted on by Seattle voters in a citywide election and the most approved auction would be adopted and SPD would be disbanded.,15,,

476,0.97,3910.306,3928.257,"Colleagues, again at the beginning of the meeting, he expressed appreciation to governor Inslee for amending the guidance offered to skip cities and local municipalities so we could continue this conversation.",99,,
477,0.97,3928.257,3937.066,"We need to make sure we are responding not only to the crisis that is Covid-19 but planning for the crisis that will come in terms of public health, and economic crisis that will be imposed on our city.",99,,
478,0.97,3937.066,3956.952,"As we do so we know that there is going to be a shortage of revenue and a need for additional investments in housing, social services, human services, small business support, support for immigrants and refugees and many who need rental and mortgage assistance.",99,,
479,0.97,3956.952,3961.991,These are the conversations we began over a month ago and while we were on hiatus there were a few calls that Councilmembers help.,99,,
480,0.97,3961.991,3975.838,I held an economic forum to hear from national and local experts including community organizations right here talking about what impact Covid will have on them.,99,,
481,0.97,3975.838,3980.142,Not just the physical health but the economic health and I would encourage you to take a listen to the to that.,99,,
482,0.97,3980.142,3991.487,We tried to do that as a way to continue the conversation and keep the momentum going as we waited for new guidance to come down.,99,,
483,0.97,3991.487,4001.797,I know there is a lot of interest in continuing this discussion in first I will turn it over to Council member Morales to remind us of the legislation in today's conversation.,99,,
484,0.97,4001.797,4003.199,,100,,
485,0.97,4003.199,4005.901,Thank you.,101,,
486,0.97,4005.901,4009.772,We have a lot to talk about so I will be brief.,101,,
487,0.97,4009.772,4016.078,I appreciate the opportunity to remind folks about what we are doing.,101,,
488,0.97,4016.078,4035.364,"I wanted to take us way back to 2019. if my colleagues will remember, we had hundreds of community conversations and forums where many of us were asked one question over and over again.",101,,
489,0.97,4035.364,4037.133,What are you going to do about homelessness?,101,,
490,0.97,4037.133,4051.213,"We had many conversations and many questions from constituents, from our communities asking over and over again, what are you going to do about the lack of housing for average workers?",101,,
491,0.97,4051.213,4055.251,What are you going to do to stop the displacement of our neighbors?,101,,
492,0.97,4055.251,4066.228,"So whether we are talking about housing first or building community wealth or Anti- displacement strategies, a key element answering these questions is housing.",101,,
493,0.97,4066.228,4072.134,We need more of it and we need it now.,101,,
494,0.97,4072.134,4088.784,"So I want to acknowledge, before we begin this process again, and I'm looking forward to discussions that we have today and in the next few weeks, I want to acknowledge that this proposal is not going to solve all the problems that we have in this city.",101,,
495,0.97,4088.784,4106.202,Since we even originally offered this bill the world has shifted in more ways than one so we acknowledge there are a lot of issues we need to have a conversation about and are looking forward to having the conversation this afternoon about the police Department.,101,,
496,0.97,4106.202,4111.507,"But, this is an important step toward funding the solutions to Long-Standing problems we have been talking about.",101,,
497,0.97,4111.507,4123.519,"Thousands of homes for people who need them, services for neighbors Transitioning out of homelessness, and especially right now, Community-Led development rooted in racial equity.",101,,
498,0.97,4123.519,4128.791,These are the issues that Councilmember Sawant and I have brought.,101,,
499,0.97,4128.791,4142.004,These are the problems we are trying to solve and the reason why we are looking for a more equitable way to fund the services that we need . I just want us to keep in mind the reason we are doing this.,101,,
500,0.97,4142.004,4165.361,"We are looking for solutions that constituents have been asking for and in order to solve some of these long- standing challenges, we have to have new sources of revenue to do it and this is what we are about to embark on as we discuss how best to do that and how best to provide some security and stability for neighbors.",101,,
501,0.97,4165.361,4169.431,"Thank you, appreciate it.",102,,
502,0.97,4169.431,4169.899,Councilmember Sawant?,102,,
503,0.97,4169.899,4173.269,Would you like to say a few words?,102,,
504,0.97,4173.269,4173.435,In,102,,
505,0.97,4173.435,4177.74,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,103,,
506,0.97,4177.74,4188.684,"As I have said before, I am really glad that our offices have brought this very important legislation forward and it has been many weeks.",103,,
507,0.97,4188.684,4195.157,The Covid crisis has already taken its toll and will continue to take its toll.,103,,
508,0.97,4195.157,4218.781,"And, the pandemic and the long- standing crisis both together have resulted with an approximate cause but not the fundamental cause, and has resulted in a recession that is very quickly turning into, in many aspects, worse than the great depression.",103,,
509,0.97,4218.781,4252.514,"This is going to be a massive economic devastation for many working-class people . But, as always, we see the disproportionate cost of the crisis and deaths, the lack of Healthcare and access to food, incidents of joblessness, and Ironically, also the people who are composed of essential workforce without hazard pay and adequate protection against the pandemic.",103,,
510,0.97,4252.514,4261.457,Disproportionately on all of these fronts we see black and Brown working-class people and children and elderly being affected.,103,,
511,0.97,4261.457,4269.365,It is so crucial that after all this delay that city council actually take some action on this.,103,,
512,0.97,4269.365,4274.87,We are in a city with the most Regressive tax system.,103,,
513,0.97,4274.87,4281.343,This is not only an overall crisis for working-class families.,103,,
514,0.97,4281.343,4287.049,The majority of people including the middle-class.,103,,
515,0.97,4287.049,4299.194,Those of us in the Working- class and middle-class we shoulder the brunt of the tax burden while the wealthiest people make 2.5% in taxes.,103,,
516,0.97,4299.194,4310.773,"When you look at the executives of top corporations like Amazon and Microsoft, they pay little to nothing and sometimes when you add up the subsidies they are paying negative taxation.",103,,
517,0.97,4310.773,4317.713,That is a stunning injustice and the status quo we have had for decades.,103,,
518,0.97,4317.713,4342.037,"It is not only that we have had a momentum for the Amazon legislation for a long while especially following the results of last year's election, it is absolutely at this moment when we have a rebellion by young people as we have seen in our movement in Seattle but also Minneapolis and Atlanta and Minneapolis.",103,,
519,0.97,4342.037,4350.145,Multi-Racial working-class young people fighting back demanding an answer against racism and police violence.,103,,
520,0.97,4350.145,4359.755,Those activists and that movement have also pointed out that it is not going to be enough for politicians to say black lives matter.,103,,
521,0.97,4359.755,4370.332,We have to put dollars on the line as others have said.,103,,
522,0.97,4370.332,4382.778,"The political establishment and the big business establishment, we need to see dollars on the table to actually address the issues that black communities and neighbors are facing.",103,,
523,0.97,4382.778,4389.785,Obviously it is paramount in the Defunding of SPD by at least 50%.,103,,
524,0.97,4389.785,4398.794,I agree with people who spoke in public comment that this is absolutely starting with Demilitarization taking away the right to purchase weapons.,103,,
525,0.97,4398.794,4406.301,Our legislation to ban chemical weapons is going to be coming for a vote on Monday.,103,,
526,0.97,4406.301,4415.21,We absolutely want a Yes vote but it goes beyond the purchase of these devastating weapons.,103,,
527,0.97,4415.21,4425.721,"We also need to go beyond that and actually cut the budget by at least half . and, use those funds for grassroots initiatives.",103,,
528,0.97,4425.721,4426.789,Not big organizations.,103,,
529,0.97,4426.789,4431.226,People already doing the work for restaurant of justice.,103,,
530,0.97,4431.226,4444.039,Along those lines I just want to make a few points because we are in such a unique moment that this is about city council actually showing that we are not tone deaf to the movement going on.,103,,
531,0.97,4444.039,4448.51,It is not just any movement.,103,,
532,0.97,4448.51,4457.453,"It is a historic moment we are experiencing and I wanted to take this opportunity to Thank- - I did this last night, but think all of the young people.",103,,
533,0.97,4457.453,4466.829,Hundreds of young people who have been on the front lines facing police fire ants--violence and brutality.,103,,
534,0.97,4466.829,4474.536,It was my honor and duty to be able to stand with you and get Maced and tear gassed . It is unacceptable the Mayor has allowed this to happen.,103,,
535,0.97,4474.536,4483.479,She is guessing her own people and the kind of courage that it takes to face that cannot be described in words.,103,,
536,0.97,4483.479,4496.458,It is important to recognize the victory this movement has won by driving the police out and is also important to remember we are not going to be able to stay there permanently.,103,,
537,0.97,4496.458,4507.169,"We need to permanently take each precinct away from the police but also do not accept that it should be voted out permanently, either.",103,,
538,0.97,4507.169,4513.709,We need city Council and the Mayor's office to convert this into a community center.,103,,
539,0.97,4513.709,4519.615,We are spoiled for choice is because so much of our needs are underfunded.,103,,
540,0.97,4519.615,4554.75,"I also wanted to say in relation to the budget, in addition to Defunding, in addition to Amazon tax legislation, we also want to echo the demands of the King County equity now coalition which is demanding the Decommissioned fire station 6 become the William grill sector for enterprise and we need to bring that forward, as well.",103,,
541,0.97,4554.75,4565.727,These are concrete initiatives that will begin to make a dent in the Gentrification displacement and racism that black and Brown families have faced.,103,,
542,0.97,4565.727,4632.728,"I also need to mention that the tax Amazon legislation is going--is very much related to the question of inequities and racism towards communities of color because the people who have been most disproportionately affected by the skyrocketing rent, buy the complete domination of the private housing market, the property management corporations, the big developers, the land prices that have shot up, all of this has disproportionately badly affected communities of color which on the Flipside means if we are able to win taxes on big business to create revenue to build social housing which is publicly owned and Rent- controlled housing, it will disproportionately also help communities of color to come back to Seattle and live in the neighborhoods that their ancestors lived in, and live in neighborhoods where they created community and where they have helped build this city.",103,,
543,0.97,4632.728,4643.538,That's why it's very important that we push for this to happen and I'm happy we will be continuing discussions now.,103,,
544,0.97,4643.538,4652.347,"I also want to echo community members who are saying--and I've said this before, that absolutely none of the activists are protesters should be prosecuted.",103,,
545,0.97,4652.347,4661.156,It would be shameful if the city brought charges against them and they should be dropped immediately.,103,,
546,0.97,4661.156,4667.262,In fact as others have said we should be thanking them for the honorable thing they are engaged in.,103,,
547,0.97,4667.262,4677.439,"And, we absolutely should make sure that we have community meetings as well as other things.",103,,
548,0.97,4677.439,4692.287,"I will be hosting the budget town hall as I do every year on the as I do every year on 16 June so we can discuss, the movement can discuss the demands from the central district and from Capitol Hill or community development.",103,,
549,0.97,4692.287,4695.891,And for the tax Amazon legislation.,103,,
550,0.97,4695.891,4697.959,Thank you.,103,,
551,0.97,4697.959,4705.801,"With that, I want to thank the folks from central staff on the line with us.",104,,
552,0.97,4705.801,4717.412,"I see Dan 25, Tom Mikesell, anybody else here with us?",104,,
553,0.97,4717.412,4726.588,Central staff has been busy preparing issue identification memos and a Powerpoint presentation.,104,,
554,0.97,4726.588,4734.329,Colleagues you should also have received those in your Email.,104,,
555,0.97,4734.329,4735.53,Thank you for waiting with us.,104,,
556,0.97,4735.53,4743.839,We will turn it over to you to walk us through the presentation that you have in the issue identification memos.,104,,
557,0.97,4743.839,4746.041,"Thank you, Mdm.",105,,
558,0.97,4746.041,4746.508,Chair.,105,,
559,0.97,4746.508,4774.736,"As the first bill on the agenda, 119772 I will t this off from my colleagues . It will be me discussing the tax bill first and then Dan Eder covering the loan legislation and Aly Pennucci and Traci Ratzlif will follow up with the spending plan legislation.",105,,
560,0.97,4774.736,4788.55,"With regards to counsel bill 119772--next slide, please--thank you.",105,,
561,0.97,4788.55,4803.798,"As we have had a series of select budget committee conversations that were delayed, we did have a fairly robust overview provided in those prior meetings.",105,,
562,0.97,4803.798,4815.977,We are going to give a light touch to what they are doing and dive into the issue identification and those amendments of which we are aware.,105,,
563,0.97,4815.977,4829.991,"With regards to the corporate payroll expense tax, this is designed to generate annual revenue of $500 million from corporate payrolls.",105,,
564,0.97,4829.991,4843.405,The structure is a rate of 1.3% on general business payrolls above $7 million per year.,105,,
565,0.97,4843.405,4845.44,"Though, there are some Specifically-Exempted businesses that are included.",105,,
566,0.97,4845.44,4857.819,"Those businesses would be nonprofit, educational, government employers, grocery stores, and businesses that the city is otherwise not legally eligible to tax.",105,,
567,0.97,4857.819,4866.161,"The legislation was to have an effective date of June 1, 2020.",106,,
568,0.97,4866.161,4873.468,I will touch on the implications of that.,106,,
569,0.97,4873.468,4879.975,There are generally 3 areas to cover with issue identification.,107,,
570,0.97,4879.975,4883.778,The first is with regards to technical and clarifying corrections.,107,,
571,0.97,4883.778,4899.928,"As I mentioned prior, the effective date of this bill was introduced in April and effective June 1. was given the delay with the governor's order.",107,,
572,0.97,4899.928,4915.31,"We find ourselves in June after the effective date of the legislation, so staff has prepared an amendment which would revise the effective date of this bill to July 1 of 2020.",107,,
573,0.97,4915.31,4924.619,"From a meaningful standpoint, what that means is less collection that will eventually be received from the tax.",107,,
574,0.97,4924.619,4939.701,That would essentially revise the first year of the tax liability from $286.1 million to $245.5 million.,107,,
575,0.97,4939.701,4956.451,"Again, the options would be to take no action and have legislation proceed as introduced, or adopt the technical amendment which is attached to the staff memo.",107,,
576,0.97,4956.451,4964.259,The next larger category issue is with regards to exemptions.,107,,
577,0.97,4964.259,4966.828,I went through this list prior.,107,,
578,0.97,4966.828,4978.64,"That list can be expanded, reduced, or otherwise modified and there are, in fact, 2 amendments that have been proposed that do just that.",107,,
579,0.97,4978.64,4989.184,"First is amendment to 2 which is introduced by a close sponsor, Councilmember Sawant.",107,,
580,0.97,4989.184,5005.8,This amendment would increase the list of exemptions to include Consumer-Directed employers and home care agencies as defined in Washington state law.,107,,
581,0.97,5005.8,5034.529,"Consumer-Directed employer would include a private entity that contracts with the State Department of social and mental health services, and employer of individual providers for performing administrative functions, and a home care agency which includes a person administering or providing home care services directly or through a contract arrangement and places of temporary or permanent residents.",107,,
582,0.97,5034.529,5042.437,Second amendment would make a revision to one of the current exemptions in the bill.,108,,
583,0.97,5042.437,5048.343,"This is in regards to grocery store, the definition of grocery story.",108,,
584,0.97,5048.343,5059.721,"As introduced, the bill sets the threshold for what determines whether businesses are a grocery store or not, at 75%.",108,,
585,0.97,5059.721,5069.064,So the annual sales of the business would be 75% from the sale of tax-exempt food products as defined in state law.,108,,
586,0.97,5069.064,5085.28,Based on feedback from Stakeholders there was concern about the scope and whether the threshold was capturing what the intent of the legislation as introduced was.,108,,
587,0.97,5085.28,5094.255,"So there is, under consideration, a reduction of that threshold amount which would include a larger set of businesses in that category.",108,,
588,0.97,5094.255,5102.997,"However, at this time, the exact percent is still being developed as a Placeholder amendment is being proposed.",108,,
589,0.97,5102.997,5111.706,It will be updated in time for an actual introduction with more data as we receive that.,108,,
590,0.97,5111.706,5136.698,And then a final issue with regards to business structures and how the definition of Seattle payroll expense in the bill is defined . There were a few different alternative business arrangements to which the bill was silent but was expanded upon by staff in presentation.,108,,
591,0.97,5136.698,5155.416,"Those included franchise businesses which are businesses that can operate through licensing arrangements with larger national or regional organizations, but there are, in fact, discrete individual businesses for the purposes of determining tax liability.",108,,
592,0.97,5155.416,5159.554,Next would be integrated business--sorry.,108,,
593,0.97,5159.554,5187.482,"Integrated enterprises which are separate, discrete businesses that identify themselves or are otherwise controlled by larger organizations or interests and for the purposes of this tax, each of those individual businesses would be treated separately for determining whether they meet the threshold.",108,,
594,0.97,5187.482,5198.259,"In both the case, as introduced, franchised businesses and integrated business enterprises, there is no education--aggregation.",108,,
595,0.97,5198.259,5219.581,"An amendment which is included as attachment D would, in fact, revise legislation such that integrated business enterprises would be Aggregated and tested against the $7 million threshold which would have the effect of increasing the coverage of the tax to a larger set of his misses.",108,,
596,0.97,5219.581,5225.887,Those are the issues and amendments that have been raised and that staff is aware of at this time.,108,,
597,0.97,5225.887,5232.994,That concludes my statements and I'm open for questions from the budget committee.,108,,
598,0.97,5232.994,5236.23,Thank you very much.,109,,
599,0.97,5236.23,5240.301,Callings you also have a central staff memo that provides more information and detail about these options.,109,,
600,0.97,5240.301,5245.139,I want to thank central staff again.,109,,
601,0.97,5245.139,5251.446,We know that you've been tremendously busy with everything that's occurring so thank you for doing that and then some.,109,,
602,0.97,5251.446,5258.553,"Colleagues, are there any questions about the information shared on this portion of the presentation?",109,,
603,0.97,5258.553,5265.66,Just going to Scroll through here . I need to see if folks have their hands up.,109,,
604,0.97,5265.66,5269.33,Feel free to Email or send me a message.,109,,
605,0.97,5269.33,5274.235,I see no hands up . Let's continue with the presentation.,109,,
606,0.97,5274.235,5278.273,So sorry.,109,,
607,0.97,5278.273,5279.274,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",109,,
608,0.97,5279.274,5280.675,Thank you so much.,110,,
609,0.97,5280.675,5284.279,I was trying to wave and nothing.,110,,
610,0.97,5284.279,5287.782,"Thank you for calling my attention to it, thank you.",111,,
611,0.97,5287.782,5306.701,"Just a clarification, the payroll tax is based on payroll in 2019, correct?",112,,
612,0.97,5306.701,5311.205,"Yes, that is correct for 2020 purposes.",113,,
613,0.97,5311.205,5330.491,"It would be based on 2019, so when we move into 2021, it would be based off of 2020 payroll and moved down the line so any year it's casting backwards to the prior year to see what that payroll was.",113,,
614,0.97,5330.491,5359.12,"Given that the reality of businesses that were eligible in 2019 because they had more than $7 million in payroll, might be very different in 2020 . Some of those businesses, it's feasible, not likely but some may be filing for bankruptcy this year.",114,,
615,0.97,5359.12,5376.17,"Or, having some other sort of extreme economic reset that would mean that payroll may be drastically reduced in 2020 from where it was in 2019.",114,,
616,0.97,5376.17,5397.692,Has there been any discussion about how to deal with the potential outcome of the Covid- 19 crisis on the economy and individual businesses that may have been doing very well in 2019 and may not be doing well in 2020?,114,,
617,0.97,5397.692,5401.996,Thank you Councilmember.,115,,
618,0.97,5401.996,5405.399,"There are 2 questions and, I guess, 2 ways to answer that.",115,,
619,0.97,5405.399,5413.107,One is with regards to the tax liability.,115,,
620,0.97,5413.107,5444.038,"So first, if a business has a lower payroll this year due to Covid-19, they would be paying--they would, indeed, be paying tax based on the lower payroll so in 2019 if they were above the threshold but then in 2020, below, they would still be eligible but however would be paying taxes off of the lower amount in 2020.",115,,
621,0.97,5444.038,5448.709,So that is from a technical perspective how it would work.,115,,
622,0.97,5448.709,5482.777,"With regards to the larger economic question of how does the revenue look after taking the large set of the business response into consideration, their staff, doing the setting of the rate waste on the revenue target, did a play a reduction to the total payroll estimate that we would have otherwise expected this year to account for individual economic circumstances.",115,,
623,0.97,5482.777,5505.199,A business that had $7 million in payroll in 2017 but may only have $5 million of payroll in 2020 will still have to pay the tax but they will be paying it based on $5 million payroll they will have in 2020.,116,,
624,0.97,5505.199,5507.602,That's correct.,117,,
625,0.97,5507.602,5515.743,Would there be a way to establish some sort of a hardship clause?,118,,
626,0.97,5515.743,5552.113,"It doesn't seem like it is in the spirit of, my understanding, the purpose of the threshold, to make a business that is seeing a reduction in staff and likely a reduction in profits, in those instances, to still have to pay the payroll tax when they are having to potentially lay people off.",118,,
627,0.97,5552.113,5574.368,"I'm wondering, would there be a way to structure a hardship clause that if your payroll is reduced by X percent over what you reported in 2019, that it would be a different tax rate that you would be exempt from having to pay.",118,,
628,0.97,5574.368,5585.579,We--at first it seems like it could be structured in such a way to account for those types of provisions.,119,,
629,0.97,5585.579,5624.318,"Refreshing back to earlier discussions, even though the liability does go into effect this year there are no effective payments until, you may recall, February 2022. so the implementation will be over a number of months extending to 2021 so from an implementation standpoint there could be a way to structure that and staff would need to work with the law Department to find the correct language to affect that change.",119,,
630,0.97,5624.318,5632.426,"And, we can work with you and others to put together an amendment that would do that, if desired.",119,,
631,0.97,5632.426,5637.331,Thank you.,120,,
632,0.97,5637.331,5649.21,"Real quick, Councilmember Sawant, I wanted to ask one more clarifying question.",121,,
633,0.97,5649.21,5658.753,Can you tell us one more time how Nonprofits as a whole are categorized in this bill?,121,,
634,0.97,5658.753,5662.156,"Yes, chair Mosqueda.",122,,
635,0.97,5662.156,5673.968,The Categorization of Nonprofits is fairly broad to include a number of different categories within Federal tax law.,122,,
636,0.97,5673.968,5690.451,"I don't have those at my fingertips, though the net was cast wide and that Categorization and is larger than the traditional 5013C.",122,,
637,0.97,5690.451,5693.254,"But, I don't have any more specificity than that.",122,,
638,0.97,5693.254,5706.701,"Colleagues, can I since I cannot see everyone at the shared same time, please message me or go ahead and Chime in if you have a question you'd like to ask and I will get you in the Queue.",123,,
639,0.97,5706.701,5709.07,Did you have a question Councilmember Sawant?,123,,
640,0.97,5709.07,5715.209,I have Clarifications to add.,124,,
641,0.97,5715.209,5724.518,"Thank you for asking these questions, and Tom gave a lot of clarification.",124,,
642,0.97,5724.518,5741.402,"I just want to add a few points to that but also to give a little bit of context to whether this is a hardship we are talking about--before that, you asked an important question about Nonprofits.",124,,
643,0.97,5741.402,5756.45,"I think we can say very simply that we are casting a wide net, but to put it in a simpler way, is that all Nonprofits are exempt.",124,,
644,0.97,5756.45,5766.861,We did that intentionally in the draft because we don't think that nonprofit organizations should be paying the tax in any way.,124,,
645,0.97,5766.861,5777.071,Is meant to be a 4-Profit business tax so rest assured know Nonprofits are going to be backed if this legislation goes into effect.,124,,
646,0.97,5777.071,5785.446,"And also, to go back to the questions from Councilmember Herbold.",124,,
647,0.97,5785.446,5786.881,The word hardship was used.,124,,
648,0.97,5786.881,5788.949,I think we need to put this in perspective.,124,,
649,0.97,5788.949,5801.695,We are talking about companies that have at least a $7 million threshold of corporate payroll.,124,,
650,0.97,5801.695,5806.6,"And, we are talking about a 1% tax on the largest businesses.",124,,
651,0.97,5806.6,5854.148,"It is only a 1% tax on the corporate payroll so if you look at the overall earnings of that corporation, it will often come out less than 1% of overall earnings so we are talking about a very, very minor component that would be taxed . I would say the tax burden is quite light to begin with and the hardship we will be seeing and that we are already seeing, is almost entirely by working families and small businesses, neither of which would be taxed even remotely in this legislation.",124,,
652,0.97,5854.148,5861.655,The whole point is to address the--of taxes that we have.,124,,
653,0.97,5861.655,5870.564,"The company who had $7 million of payroll in 2019 but saw a reduction in 2020 will have a tax bill of $91,000.",124,,
654,0.97,5870.564,5877.738,Even if they had a reduction in the next year they still have to pay the tax on the last years payroll.,124,,
655,0.97,5877.738,5882.176,"And they will have to pay but will have a tax bill of 91,000.",124,,
656,0.97,5882.176,5885.646,"Put that in perspective, that is nothing.",124,,
657,0.97,5885.646,5888.849,As was just noted they will have a full 18 months to pay.,124,,
658,0.97,5888.849,5899.727,Compare that to the kind of conditions that the majority are facing.,124,,
659,0.97,5899.727,5910.771,Once the moratorium is listed he will not have the resources to start pulling up rent and back rent and so on.,124,,
660,0.97,5910.771,5925.185,"Another thing to put this in perspective, Amazon is one of those, it is a pandemic Profiteer, but we are also talking about major law forms.",124,,
661,0.97,5925.185,5929.089,Law firms.,124,,
662,0.97,5929.089,5932.126,We are talking about the biggest steel farm in the company located in district 1.,124,,
663,0.97,5932.126,5963.223,"We are talking about Wells Fargo which has exploited communities of color for years and was also prosecuted by the Department of justice, and we are talking about, for example, these are some examples of corporations that would be tax-free and we are not talking about small or medium-sized businesses by any means.",124,,
664,0.97,5963.223,5964.858,We are definitely not talking about Woking families.,124,,
665,0.97,5964.858,5973.767,So we have brought this legislation forward because this was technically a Legally- feasible way to measure the best and most accurate thing.,124,,
666,0.97,5973.767,5991.885,"If Councilmember her bold or have other ideas of identifying these businesses, I would welcome those suggestions so that we can pass progressive legislation.",124,,
667,0.97,5991.885,5995.089,I see Councilmember Herbold nodding as well.,125,,
668,0.97,5995.089,6007.501,"It's hard to see all of the Councilmembers when we are doing one Video at a time but I'm going to ask, if there are other questions on this legislation, we have 2 were pieces to get through.",125,,
669,0.97,6007.501,6013.407,"Pausing in case anybody is muted . Okay, great.",125,,
670,0.97,6013.407,6021.315,Let's continue to go through the Powerpoint hesitation and back over to central stuff.,125,,
671,0.97,6021.315,6035.929,This is Dan Eder deputy director of the central staff team . My portion of the presentation addresses the Inter-Fund loan bill.,126,,
672,0.97,6035.929,6056.85,"At the April 29 budget committee, the committee walked through a detailed discussion and today I will provide a brief overview and summary of the bill and will tee up 3 potential issues for consideration and address any questions you may have.",126,,
673,0.97,6056.85,6066.96,"As you just finished discussing, revenue from a proposed bill will not be available to spend until the 2021 budget.",126,,
674,0.97,6066.96,6088.282,"The Interfund loan bill is therefore proposed to serve as a bridge between revenues from the tax bill that I just spoke about, and the planned 2020 spending that would be authorized through a separate bill that we will discuss next.",126,,
675,0.97,6088.282,6104.598,The Inter-Fund loan bill would authorize the city to borrow from the consolidated cash pool and name specific source funds which would allow the city to pay for 2020 spending.,126,,
676,0.97,6104.598,6126.72,"In particular the bill would authorize up to $50 million from each of 6 source funds up to a cumulative total of $200 million in borrowed amounts plus interest and would then be repaid--I'm sorry, with a future flow of tax revenues.",126,,
677,0.97,6126.72,6141.935,The source funds were selected to provide a range of options that minimize or eliminate the impact on planned spending for projects and programs.,126,,
678,0.97,6141.935,6163.457,"And, like the tax bill and spending bill, the Interfund loan bill includes an emergency clause that would require a three quarters super majority of Councilmembers, and for the Mayor to sign it.",126,,
679,0.97,6163.457,6174.268,This slide highlights information which is included on your agenda in a staff memo.,127,,
680,0.97,6174.268,6177.938,There are 3 issues which I have Teed up for your consideration.,127,,
681,0.97,6177.938,6180.974,The first is source funding.,127,,
682,0.97,6180.974,6195.455,"As I mentioned a moment ago, the bill identifies 6 separate funds that would serve as potential sources for up to $200 million in the community alone.",127,,
683,0.97,6195.455,6232.125,"Those are for low income housing, the move Seattle Fund, the family's education preschool and promise Fund, the 2019 library levy Fund, the parks district Fund, and something called a housing incentive Fund . We have discovered in the weeks since our last discussion that the housing incentive fund is actually a Sub- fund that supports the low income housing Fund and as a technical correction, the Council should consider removing that fixed Fund from the list of authorized source funding.",127,,
684,0.97,6232.125,6245.138,"That is the first issue I bring to your attention . The options are do nothing, essentially no action, or remove the housing incentive Fund from the list of source funding.",127,,
685,0.97,6245.138,6251.445,Are there any questions about the first issue?,127,,
686,0.97,6251.445,6256.35,I will walk through all of the issues and then answer any questions at the end.,127,,
687,0.97,6256.35,6258.952,That sounds great.,128,,
688,0.97,6258.952,6267.728,The 2ND issue is the authorized source fund amounts.,129,,
689,0.97,6267.728,6300.594,"Again, Harkening back to our discussion on April 29 the last budget committee meeting, CBO updated the low income housing fund ending fund balance that had been in the range of $146 million but the updated estimate is that that fund alone will have approximately $257 million at the end of 2020 available for an Inter-Fund low.",129,,
690,0.97,6300.594,6316.209,The action in this issue would be to consider amending the authorized loan amount from this funding source to be for the entire $200 million cumulative loan.,129,,
691,0.97,6316.209,6334.227,"In conjunction with this potential change, Councilmembers could either leave intact the other remaining source funds or drop the authorization for the others and lean entirely on low income housing.",129,,
692,0.97,6334.227,6339.199,The 3RD issue is the cumulative loan amount.,130,,
693,0.97,6339.199,6348.942,"As I mentioned, the cumulative Interfund loan amount from any subsidiary sources is $200 million.",130,,
694,0.97,6348.942,6362.756,"Councilmembers could leave the amount as is as a matter of policy choice . You could increase the amount, or you could authorize a lower cumulative Interfund.",130,,
695,0.97,6362.756,6374.334,"If you were to change the loan amount to something other than $200 million, that would, of Úcourse, affect your ability to spend.",130,,
696,0.97,6374.334,6388.982,"You would have more money if you increased the cumulative amount, or less money in 2020 if you have a lower cumulative Interfund loan amount.",130,,
697,0.97,6388.982,6395.689,That concludes the issues that staff have identified and we are happy to address any questions you may have.,130,,
698,0.97,6395.689,6397.557,Thank you very much.,131,,
699,0.97,6397.557,6401.094,Dan?,131,,
700,0.97,6401.094,6403.096,Okay.,131,,
701,0.97,6403.096,6411.705,"Council colleagues, any questions?",131,,
702,0.97,6411.705,6419.212,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",131,,
703,0.97,6419.212,6425.919,You are on mute still and I saw your NOTE requesting the questions.,131,,
704,0.97,6425.919,6427.521,Thank you.,132,,
705,0.97,6427.521,6441.935,"One question as it relates specifically to the Interfund loan, I should probably qualify this that it's actually not limited to the loan.",132,,
706,0.97,6441.935,6457.05,It is Tangentially connected to it but is more of a how are we in the future going to pay--are we going to have another Interfund loan in the future?,132,,
707,0.97,6457.05,6472.866,The way that I see it is we are contemplating taking a loan of $200 million so that we can spend some of these funds in 2020 where there is great need.,132,,
708,0.97,6472.866,6486.68,We are not going to be collecting funds until 2022 so we are going to be spending $500 million in 2021 that we will not have collect it again.,132,,
709,0.97,6486.68,6493.386,"So that creates a need, it seems, to pay back $400 million.",132,,
710,0.97,6493.386,6504.564,"That 200 that we spent this year and the 500 we will spend next year, before the collection of funds in 2022.",132,,
711,0.97,6504.564,6528.321,I know that I have asked this before a central staff and there has been sort of reference to the fact that it is not unusual for the city to spend budgeted funds at the beginning of the year before they have collected them and there is some accounting magic that allows us to do it.,132,,
712,0.97,6528.321,6548.742,"I have asked for and not received an explanation of exactly how that works, and whether or not we have, as a practice, have done it to this scale of $700 million that we are basically looking at sort of fronting, as I understand, at the beginning of 2021.",132,,
713,0.97,6548.742,6556.75,"Councilmember, my read of that is similar to yours but a little bit different.",133,,
714,0.97,6556.75,6577.671,"The $200 million loan would, in 2020, not be repaid until the very end of the budget year for 2021 which includes some month or so of 2022.",133,,
715,0.97,6577.671,6591.685,The way that our books work is some revenues come in after December 31 of the calendar year and are still counted toward that same calendar year.,133,,
716,0.97,6591.685,6612.405,"So, you are correct that the flow of tax revenues from the new payroll tax would begin effectively February 1 of 2022.",133,,
717,0.97,6612.405,6623.183,The entirety of the funding received by that date would accrue back to the 2021 budget and be available for spending in 2021.,133,,
718,0.97,6623.183,6641.101,"It would be at that time we would repay the $200 million Interfund loan from 2020 and would also have, for the first time, cash expected to cover the expenses that are incurred in 2021.",133,,
719,0.97,6641.101,6663.523,"My understanding is, that is similar to how several property tax measures work where there is typically a chunk of money received in April and October of the same calendar year we are talking about spending the money.",133,,
720,0.97,6663.523,6684.277,But there is an uneven flow of funds and many times it is higher than the $200 million being talked about on par with the $500 million that we are talking about supporting spending in 2021.,133,,
721,0.97,6684.277,6714.774,"So I cannot speak with authority because I don't personally do the balancing of the books but my understanding is this is not an unusual kind of balancing act and, the consolidated cash pool even in the Post-Covert economic climate, expected to be sufficiently healthy to allow for this kind of quote.",133,,
722,0.97,6714.774,6719.012,Thank you.,134,,
723,0.97,6719.012,6750.743,"I would also add that a large percentage of funding and spending in 2021 is for investments in social housing and generally speaking, those financing commitments would be made, likely toward the end of the year and typically do not go out the door immediately so it would not necessarily be a lot of writing checks in 2021 with 75% of the funding going to investments in new housing.",134,,
724,0.97,6750.743,6762.655,"I would suggest that is a great Segue to look at the spend plan if we could get through those, and see if there are additional questions.",135,,
725,0.97,6762.655,6771.464,"Aly Pennucci, counsel central staff.",136,,
726,0.97,6771.464,6773.666,"Good afternoon, Councilmembers.",137,,
727,0.97,6773.666,6784.677,Today I will walk through a brief overview of the proposed spending plan and Walk-Through 5 issue areas and answer any questions.,137,,
728,0.97,6784.677,6793.186,"And then, Tracy will provide additional information particularly in response to any detailed questions you might have.",137,,
729,0.97,6793.186,6806.599,"Generally speaking as proposed, 119774 would establish a spending plan from revenue generated by the proposed payroll tax.",137,,
730,0.97,6806.599,6821.414,"Were specifically the bill would authorize $200 million of spending in 2020 made available through the Interfund loan just described to be used for emergency cash assistance for up to 100,000 low income households affected by the Covid emergency.",137,,
731,0.97,6821.414,6828.121,It also outlines the intended taxis of 2020 and beyond.,137,,
732,0.97,6828.121,6839.499,$205 million in 2021 would be used to replay the principal and interest on the Interfund loan.,137,,
733,0.97,6839.499,6842.735,And then all remaining funds in future years would be allocated as follows.,137,,
734,0.97,6842.735,6858.952,75% of remaining revenue would be used for investments to build or require social housing and to support the ongoing operation and services needed for permanent support of housing developments.,137,,
735,0.97,6858.952,6867.327,25% of remaining revenue would be invested in housing -Related strategies called for in the green new deal resolution.,137,,
736,0.97,6867.327,6873.633,"In addition, the proposal directs the executive to submit implementation plans to the Council for the new tax.",137,,
737,0.97,6873.633,6919.279,It also establishes a new social housing board that would provide recommendations to the Ayor and the Council on invitation in the Mentation of social housing investments and it includes adding a responsibility to coordinate with the social housing board and specifically calls out oversight of the proposed deal investments that would flow from this . Because spending is proposed to respond from public needs resulting from the homelessness emergencies and to address climate change includes an emergency provision and would have an immediate effect if passed and signed by the Mayor.,137,,
738,0.97,6919.279,6935.395,"With that, I will move on to the discussion of issues and bear with me when I learn how to flip between screens.",137,,
739,0.97,6935.395,6935.595,So.,137,,
740,0.97,6935.595,6947.173,The issues and options that I'm going to walk through are not necessarily exhaustive and additional amendments may be identified over the course of the reviewed discussion of public engagement.,137,,
741,0.97,6947.173,6956.749,I will also NOTE specific amendments attached to the memo are still drafts and may be modified prior to final Council action.,137,,
742,0.97,6956.749,6977.97,Amendment one will be revised to a date attachment one attachment 1 to reflect a later effective date of the tax which would result in slightly lower tax revenue estimates which will impact the proposed number of housing units . those changes will be described in future discussions.,137,,
743,0.97,6977.97,6988.981,"With that, I will turn to the first issue identified by staff that is really just describing some clarifying corrections that are needed.",137,,
744,0.97,6988.981,7001.994,The bill includes references to certain figures that are now outdated and in addition we've identified technical errors that should be corrected and if you places where the sponsors needed clarification.,137,,
745,0.97,7001.994,7037.93,"Number one is sponsored by Councilmember Sawant and would address technical errors and make a few additional changes to better align draft legislation with her intent including reorganizing and adding to proposed findings in section 1 and updating the CPI index that would be used to regulate the maximum annual rent increases that could be imposed among housing units supporting by the investments, and sets an absolute maximum for annual rent increases to not more than 3%.",137,,
746,0.97,7037.93,7042.435,"And then there is a series, like I said, of technical corrections.",137,,
747,0.97,7042.435,7048.307,The 2ND issue is proposed assistance in 2020.,137,,
748,0.97,7048.307,7063.956,The bill authorized spending emergency cash assistance to low income households affected by the Covid-19 emergency.,137,,
749,0.97,7063.956,7077.069,"As proposed, 50% or $100 million of the funds would be distributed to low income households or state programs administered by the city.",137,,
750,0.97,7077.069,7082.041,"The 2ND half, about $100 million would be distributed to those impacted by Covid when not already enrolled in existing city programs.",137,,
751,0.97,7082.041,7085.845,The process would be developed by the executive's.,137,,
752,0.97,7085.845,7092.385,It Prioritizes providing financial assistance to low income households as quickly as possible.,137,,
753,0.97,7092.385,7115.508,The Trade-Off is designed to move quickly and could reach some people who are less in need and not reach the priority populations or households most in need . page 5 posted to the April 29 committee agenda outlines other models that could be used to distribute the emergency cash assistance.,137,,
754,0.97,7115.508,7130.59,The primary difference that we found is that those programs relied more on partnerships with Community-Based organizations to identify recipients and in some cases to determine the mix of services that would best serve the community.,137,,
755,0.97,7130.59,7154.747,"While the bill is introduced it would not prohibit Partnering from Community-Based organizations to distribute, Councilmember Sawant has proposed an amendment to make it very clear that this is an option and reflected in an amendment including an attachment to the memo.",137,,
756,0.97,7154.747,7164.724,That clarifies that the 2ND half of the emergency cash assistance could be distributed through partnerships with Community-Based organizations.,137,,
757,0.97,7164.724,7186.979,"So, while Partnering with Community-Based organizations may take more time to get assistance out the door and sending checks to households who we have already identified, they are likely better positioned to ensure Assistances reaching priority populations and may better be connected with the types of assistance that those communities need.",137,,
758,0.97,7186.979,7210.77,"Councilmember Morales has proposed an amendment to the central staff memo that would require that assistance is distributed through partnerships with Community- based organizations and that it could be used for a variety of relief services such as rental assistance, help with medical care or direct financial assistance.",137,,
759,0.97,7210.77,7224.016,"No action, adopting amendment 2 as proposed by Councilmember Sawant, or adopting amendment 3 as proposed by Councilmember Morales.",137,,
760,0.97,7224.016,7227.62,The 3RD issue area is related to the proposed spending categories.,137,,
761,0.97,7227.62,7240.833,"As noted, after repayment of the Interfund loan 75% would be allocated to acquire affordable social housing and provide services for permanent support of housing units.",137,,
762,0.97,7240.833,7244.737,"And, 25% to support green new deal strategies.",137,,
763,0.97,7244.737,7253.212,There are ways this new revenue could be allocated and Councilmembers may want to consider other spending priorities.,137,,
764,0.97,7253.212,7273.566,Amendment 4 included in attachment D sponsored by Councilmember Morales would modify categories to include support for the equitable development initiative by allocating 10% to Edi projects and reducing allocation to green new deal investments by 5%.,137,,
765,0.97,7273.566,7284.61,70% would be infested in--invested in social housing and 10% to support projects funded through the equitable development initiative.,137,,
766,0.97,7284.61,7298.991,I think it's worth noting that the equitable development initiative projects often include affordable housing but those projects are not yet identified today.,137,,
767,0.97,7298.991,7309.702,"The options provided for the consideration of the committee are taking no action, adopting the amendment as proposed, or to propose other spending categories.",137,,
768,0.97,7309.702,7314.807,Thank you so much Traci and Aly.,138,,
769,0.97,7314.807,7316.142,"I'm sorry, please continue.",138,,
770,0.97,7316.142,7319.311,There are 2 more.,139,,
771,0.97,7319.311,7334.36,The 4TH issue is related to income levels served by the proposed investments . The proposal would be to provide Housings up to 100% of Area- median income.,139,,
772,0.97,7334.36,7348.941,Funding policies have historically Prioritized investments in rental housing that assist households at or below 80% of the median area income with the majority's assisting below.,139,,
773,0.97,7348.941,7355.848,Councilmembers could consider Prioritizing investments to support households with lower incomes.,139,,
774,0.97,7355.848,7373.933,Councilmember morale us has proposed an amendment that would modify the proposed income levels served by the new housing investments that would reduce the maximum income from 100% of median income to 80%.,139,,
775,0.97,7373.933,7381.04,It would Prioritize funding for housing for households below that.,139,,
776,0.97,7381.04,7388.347,So options provided for the consideration is taking no action or adopting amendment 5 as shown in attachment it.,139,,
777,0.97,7388.347,7399.692,"And not listed here, anything I would say 80% or below is an option available to the committee.",139,,
778,0.97,7399.692,7415.241,"Finally the fifth amendment, the 5th issue identified for discussion is related to the implementation plan Submittal date and the process that would inform development of that implementation plan.",139,,
779,0.97,7415.241,7439.331,"As introduced, the bill would require the plan consistent with the legislation authorizing spending does not establish a firm Timeline . both in the technical amendment described as amendment 1, and this amendment posed by Councilmember Morales, the Submittal date would be February 1 of 2021.",139,,
780,0.97,7439.331,7450.342,"In this amendment, the implementation plan would inform investments for 2022 through 2025.",139,,
781,0.97,7450.342,7461.453,"Becausethe Council will have to make decisions about 2021 in just a few months, it would request the executive SEEKS input from Stakeholders developing that proposal.",139,,
782,0.97,7461.453,7483.776,"So the options available to the Council laid out in the memo is no option, adopting amendment 6 and included in attachment f or proposing an alternate schedule or plan for how to move forward with developing and implementation and proposing investments in 2021.",139,,
783,0.97,7483.776,7488.28,Just noting for the slides I think it says amendment 5 but we want to know that as amendment 6. correct?,140,,
784,0.97,7488.28,7495.588,"It is, yes.",141,,
785,0.97,7495.588,7502.494,We been working night and day so I just wanted to clarify in case there was a question when we go back to that for any reason.,142,,
786,0.97,7502.494,7503.696,That concludes my statements.,143,,
787,0.97,7503.696,7505.497,Happy to take questions.,143,,
788,0.97,7505.497,7508.4,I didn't mean to cut you guys off.,144,,
789,0.97,7508.4,7509.869,Any other statements on this?,144,,
790,0.97,7509.869,7514.506,"No, here to answer questions.",145,,
791,0.97,7514.506,7517.71,Will be looking to colleagues who have their hands raised.,146,,
792,0.97,7517.71,7522.014,Just go ahead and let me know.,146,,
793,0.97,7522.014,7526.685,Councilmember Herbold?,146,,
794,0.97,7526.685,7530.789,"So sorry, you are on mute.",147,,
795,0.97,7530.789,7535.427,You'd think I have this down by now.,148,,
796,0.97,7535.427,7557.95,"So as it relates specifically to the direct payments to households in the first year, just a concern about how the interplay is anticipated with other social service programs that have income eligibility requirements.",148,,
797,0.97,7557.95,7583.943,I don't know if these direct payments have the potential of making households ineligible for other services or programs they depend on . that is a question that has come up that we don't have a firm answer for yet.,148,,
798,0.97,7583.943,7596.956,It is judged by programs and we are trying to sort this out in real time with some of the other assistance going out the door for right now through the city.,148,,
799,0.97,7596.956,7599.191,We will follow up with more information when we can.,148,,
800,0.97,7599.191,7626.218,"I will say in some cases, providing not direct cash assistance may mitigate some of those concerns so the proposal included in this amendment may address some of that which is modeled, I should say, off of the program that the city of Austin set up early on in the crisis which I think was maybe just 2 months ago but feels much longer.",148,,
801,0.97,7626.218,7628.921,So we will follow up.,148,,
802,0.97,7628.921,7629.521,Thank you.,149,,
803,0.97,7629.521,7647.539,"As it relates to the immediate direct payments, does the spending plan provide help to folks experiencing finding homes or shelter during the pandemic?",149,,
804,0.97,7647.539,7654.313,Is that contemplated in the direct payments or another part of the spending plan?,149,,
805,0.97,7654.313,7655.881,Is not contemplated directly.,150,,
806,0.97,7655.881,7684.276,"So, if the legislation moved forward as proposed, I believe it was the intent to be able to allow people experiencing homelessness to receive those payments and then they could use the money for whatever they need including hotel rooms or other housing options if they could find any for $500.",150,,
807,0.97,7684.276,7687.68,That would be one strategy.,150,,
808,0.97,7687.68,7711.103,"If the amendment is adopted, certainly service providers, Community-Based organizations that provide and work with people experiencing homelessness could provide assistance for a variety of assistance but would not be prohibited based on the play.",150,,
809,0.97,7711.103,7714.573,Future spending is really focused on long-term housing.,150,,
810,0.97,7714.573,7728.387,And with Prioritizing investments or investing a significant amount in permanent supportive housing designed to serve people coming out of homelessness.,150,,
811,0.97,7728.387,7739.331,"There is not direct spending on homeless, sort of the intermediate steps it is focused on the longer-term.",150,,
812,0.97,7739.331,7755.147,That Segues into my last question as it relates specifically to permanent support of housing . They have signed on to the proposal to scale housing over the next 5 years.,151,,
813,0.97,7755.147,7767.025,Just want to confirm that this plan not only includes allocation for capital costs but to support the operating costs as well.,151,,
814,0.97,7767.025,7777.736,The plan assumes that the city is paying the full cost of all new permanent support of housing units.,152,,
815,0.97,7777.736,7785.878,"Instead, that money was invested in a partnership with other regional partners and those dollars were leveraged.",152,,
816,0.97,7785.878,7797.723,It would likely produce additional housing and some of that may be directed toward housing as well as other income brackets.,152,,
817,0.97,7797.723,7799.892,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,153,,
818,0.97,7799.892,7803.695,Councilmember morale us has a comment.,153,,
819,0.97,7803.695,7808.2,Thank you.,154,,
820,0.97,7808.2,7816.708,I do want to come back to the question about emergency assistance that we intended.,154,,
821,0.97,7816.708,7825.517,"I want to acknowledge that the crisis, first of all, is far from over.",154,,
822,0.97,7825.517,7832.191,For many people the financial burden that Covid has placed them in still exist.,154,,
823,0.97,7832.191,7846.939,"Savings are running out, state unemployment insurance is not working for people and it's just as important now as it was when the crisis first hit.",154,,
824,0.97,7846.939,7863.422,"That said, when they originally contemplated including the provision in this bill, the circumstances were felt more urgently in terms of trying to get cash assistance out.",154,,
825,0.97,7863.422,7902.661,"Since that time, as Aly mentioned, I know before we have talked about some cities having experience with trying to get emergency assistance out quickly . I will say if there is a different way to do it if there is Federal assistance coming through that we could use through Community-Based organizations and I think that is certainly something we should talk about and consider.",154,,
826,0.97,7902.661,7911.803,"The reason that we, my amendment is saying we focus on Community-Based organization.",154,,
827,0.97,7911.803,7924.616,"The reason is, they have that kind of trust in deep relationship with folks who are in communities who are clients and people that they serve.",154,,
828,0.97,7924.616,7929.421,Tey know what kind of assistance is needed.,154,,
829,0.97,7929.421,7947.339,"And particularly as we talk about the need to include folks who are Undocumented or perhaps on banked, the idea of just sending a check is not necessarily going to achieve the goal that we have.",154,,
830,0.97,7947.339,7953.645,"So, what my amendment is trying to addresses this question of how we provide financial assistance that isn't necessarily cash.",154,,
831,0.97,7953.645,7962.354,"Maybe it's a prepaid debit card, housing assistance, rental assistance, food security assistance.",154,,
832,0.97,7962.354,7964.289,Some people may need less than $500.,154,,
833,0.97,7964.289,7983.475,"That seems unlikely, but I think the point is if we give the organizations that already have relationships and know how to reach people the flexibility to do what is needed, it may take a little longer to set up but I think in the long run it would serve people better.",154,,
834,0.97,7983.475,8032.624,"The last thing that I want to say is when I did have a conversation with an Austin city Councilmember about how they set up their program, one of the reasons that he gave for working directly with Community- based organizations instead of, for example, through the utility discount Graham, is that in some places if a resident is in--with a city Department in this kind of emergency assistance comes through, some departments are keeping the assistance from clients who are--rather than just being a Pass-Through for support.",154,,
835,0.97,8032.624,8038.53,We really do not want that to be happening right now.,154,,
836,0.97,8038.53,8045.003,I will stop there but I just wanted to make those few points about the rationale for the amendment that I'm offering.,154,,
837,0.97,8045.003,8054.413,"Very helpful, thank you Councilmember Morales.",155,,
838,0.97,8054.413,8073.665,"You don't have to answer right now but I also wanted to double check that given the cash assistance that the Federal level has--I'm sorry, given the cash assistance at the Federal level, perhaps there is some way we can Replicate language to make sure those dollars didn't kick people off of other programs.",155,,
839,0.97,8073.665,8077.736,I see Aly nodding her head so I assume you are already on that.,155,,
840,0.97,8077.736,8083.175,I don't see any other Council members with their hands up.,155,,
841,0.97,8083.175,8091.883,"Colleagues, this has been a conversation we have all been anticipating and really appreciate your feedback for central staff.",155,,
842,0.97,8091.883,8096.855,There is a few ideas that people may still be Percolating on.,155,,
843,0.97,8096.855,8111.069,"I know that I have a strong interest in working with every one of you to make sure that we have passed progressive, comprehensive revenue as the sponsors have talked about.",155,,
844,0.97,8111.069,8121.413,"Really assess those who are continuing to essentially do well in a Post-Covid world, and recognize the need is urgent and was urgent when the bill was introduced.",155,,
845,0.97,8121.413,8123.882,We have a real call to action here.,155,,
846,0.97,8123.882,8136.428,"The next meeting that we have as you see, we are going to devote the full first part of the day next Wednesday to talking about revenue proposals.",155,,
847,0.97,8136.428,8150.242,"Really urge you to send any questions or comments to central staff and for Councilmembers who are the sponsors I'm going to encourage folks to send questions, ideas, amendments, by noon on Friday.",155,,
848,0.97,8150.242,8154.346,Seeing a nod that would be ideal.,155,,
849,0.97,8154.346,8155.413,Is go ahead.,155,,
850,0.97,8155.413,8168.593,Just wanted to 2ND your comments that we have a shared interest in recognizing the urgency.,156,,
851,0.97,8168.593,8169.961,It was urgent and continues to be urgent.,156,,
852,0.97,8169.961,8171.763,"If anything, it's more urgent.",156,,
853,0.97,8171.763,8183.775,And I also wanted to use this opportunity to also say I welcome any questions or amendments for us to look at.,156,,
854,0.97,8183.775,8187.078,I appreciate you also underlining the need for that to be done sooner rather than later.,156,,
855,0.97,8187.078,8191.883,"And, just to think central staff for their incredible work.",156,,
856,0.97,8191.883,8196.221,"They have basically given up every weekend, as far as I know, so thank you so much.",156,,
857,0.97,8196.221,8202.894,"Any additional comments from you, Councilmember morale is?",157,,
858,0.97,8202.894,8205.497,-- Morales?,157,,
859,0.97,8205.497,8212.003,I just want to thank the chair for Rebooting this conversation.,158,,
860,0.97,8212.003,8227.218,"I think we all agree this is incredibly important and is a moment in time where I do think our community, our constituents are calling on us to find some answers and solutions to these Long-Standing problems.",158,,
861,0.97,8227.218,8237.829,"So, I am hopeful we can move through this and am happy to answer questions or field questions from folks.",158,,
862,0.97,8237.829,8263.355,I also want to echo counsel Councilmember Sawant and staff who have been incredibly helpful and diligent helping us think through alternatives and really Prioritize our goal around serving our community and making sure we are addressing the many crises that we have right now as best we can.,158,,
863,0.97,8263.355,8269.261,Thank you.,158,,
864,0.97,8269.261,8274.332,We appreciate the joint presentation on these first 3 items.,159,,
865,0.97,8274.332,8274.966,Thank you so much.,159,,
866,0.97,8274.966,8279.471,"We have another presentation, item number 4 code.",159,,
867,0.97,8279.471,8287.178,I will ask central staff to read it into the record and have some comments as well and we will introduce central staff folks.,159,,
868,0.97,8287.178,8296.688,Could you please read item number 4 into the record?,159,,
869,0.97,8296.688,8297.455,Mdm.,159,,
870,0.97,8297.455,8303.161,"Clerk, we do not hear you.",159,,
871,0.97,8303.161,8305.263,Excuse me.,160,,
872,0.97,8305.263,8312.37,Agenda item 4. for briefing and discussion only.,160,,
873,0.97,8312.37,8326.117,"Colleagues, to frame this conversation, as you heard on Monday we are using today is our first opportunity to initiate an inquest into the Seattle police Department budget.",161,,
874,0.97,8326.117,8343.034,"We stated on Monday that our intent is to provide a full, thorough, transparent deep dive into the budget simultaneous to ongoing revision and review and amendments to the 2020 revised Úbudget of the Mayor.",161,,
875,0.97,8343.034,8347.305,We were told the budget is still being worked on.,161,,
876,0.97,8347.305,8356.748,"They have asked for additional time, at least a week but potentially more, for them to respond to the crisis that I think everyone is seeing in the street.",161,,
877,0.97,8356.748,8369.427,I'm looking forward to receiving that budget and I think that is potentially good news that the words and call for community have been heard and they have held onto that budget to do additional amendments before setting it down.,161,,
878,0.97,8369.427,8385.477,That does not relieve us of our responsibility and our duty to provide not just amendments around the edges but to really assess whether they are meeting values as a whole and specifically to the allocation of the police Department.,161,,
879,0.97,8385.477,8427.318,"The community has been demanding of officials that we look at how we spend into the police Department's budget . the public safety system we are trying to create is new so I want to lift up the words from Councilmember Warez and others on Monday who said we need to make sure this is a thorough process and I think it's important we also lift up the words of the community that says as we tried to create a new system we also need to be gracious with each other to figure out what the next chapter looks like because if we do not do this in a thoughtful way and end up Re- creating the systems we are trying to dismantle, we have not actually accomplished change.",161,,
880,0.97,8427.318,8436.895,"Our intent is to accomplish change and use this tool that is the budget process to initiate that change, and we are going to make sure we do it with urgency.",161,,
881,0.97,8436.895,8449.441,"We are not going to drag our feet need to be intentional to ensure accountability and transparency and will do this together with community organizations, especially Black- line.",161,,
882,0.97,8449.441,8457.549,This chapter includes a city where we can imagine community safety and strength that comes from these relationships.,161,,
883,0.97,8457.549,8474.666,"Fire ant neighborhoods, healthy and equitable economies, and housing as a human right, and investing in our environment so we are not creating toxic communities where depending on your zip code, your life expectancy or health outcomes are determined.",161,,
884,0.97,8474.666,8483.174,That's part of what we have heard coming from community as we think about Defunding and Reallocating it.,161,,
885,0.97,8483.174,8487.879,We need to assess where dollars are going to go in the message truly will come from community.,161,,
886,0.97,8487.879,8490.682,We have seen other examples across the country where they have done similar efforts.,161,,
887,0.97,8490.682,8493.551,"In Camden, New Jersey is often lifted up.",161,,
888,0.97,8493.551,8510.201,As we look at other models it's important to remember that since 2010 the Seattle police Department has seen a 43% increase in funding while we have seen other social services desperately trying to make ends meet.,161,,
889,0.97,8510.201,8511.803,We are not isolated in this problem.,161,,
890,0.97,8511.803,8541.232,"The center for popular democracy black youth project 100 and Laufer black lives released a groundbreaking report in 2017 entitled freedom to thrive, remaining safe and secure in our communities which reveals how cities and counties continue to spend overwhelmingly on punitive policing and Incarceration while neglecting infrastructure and social programs.",161,,
891,0.97,8541.232,8559.15,They provide examples in Minneapolis for each dollar spent on police less than one cent goes to transportation and youth violence in New York which spends $5 million on its police force even as homelessness and affordable housing crises continue to increase.,161,,
892,0.97,8559.15,8561.719,In Baltimore 28% of the population lives below the poverty line.,161,,
893,0.97,8561.719,8574.566,Baltimore spends $772 per person on policing and for every dollar the city spends on the police it contributes just $.55 to Baltimore public schools.,161,,
894,0.97,8574.566,8590.848,"In Oakland which spends the entire percentage of General fund expenditures on policing of jurisdictions, 41% overall for every dollar spending on policing from total budget, the city spends $.08 on housing and community development.",161,,
895,0.97,8590.848,8606.898,"These are some examples to say that we are not alone in over investments in policing as we know it, currently, and are also not alone asking for a real, fundamental change in how we do policing.",161,,
896,0.97,8606.898,8617.408,"Minneapolis city council jointly announced they are dismantling and reinvesting dollars and doing it through a community process that will take a year, they announced.",161,,
897,0.97,8617.408,8622.747,"We also know from the New York and Los Angeles Mayor that they are decreasing funding, as well.",161,,
898,0.97,8622.747,8628.219,So we are not alone in the need to do this.,161,,
899,0.97,8628.219,8629.821,This is an institutional issue across the country.,161,,
900,0.97,8629.821,8635.36,Someone asked me in an interview what are they doing wrong specifically?,161,,
901,0.97,8635.36,8644.235,"I think as we saw the response in the last 2 weeks, it is not just our Department.",161,,
902,0.97,8644.235,8645.903,It is the institution policing across the country.,161,,
903,0.97,8645.903,8658.249,"I wanted to lift up those other cities as examples that we will continue to learn from as we engage in this process, and really take direction from community organizations that are Black-Led and communities who have been calling for this for a very long time.",161,,
904,0.97,8658.249,8671.462,Councilmember Herbold had some comments as well as she has been collecting feedback and questions for a long time but especially after last Wednesday's meeting that she lead.,161,,
905,0.97,8671.462,8672.13,While Councilmember Pres.,161,,
906,0.97,8672.13,8687.545,Gonzalez could not be here she also sent powerful remarks in support of this effort and we appreciate her comments and ongoing past efforts to really call out police violence and the need for change.,161,,
907,0.97,8687.545,8693.584,"We know we are here to do much, much more than we have done in the past and we think Councilmember Herbold for Chiming in at this moment.",161,,
908,0.97,8693.584,8697.689,Thank you.,162,,
909,0.97,8697.689,8719.21,Just want to really show my appreciation to you for your framework for this discussion calling it an inquest for the Seattle Department budget and a Forensic look at the black box that is the $409 million budget of the police Department.,162,,
910,0.97,8719.21,8734.625,I think that really shows the approach that we intend to take and I appreciate your recognition that what we are doing here in Seattle is happening also within the context of cities all over the country.,162,,
911,0.97,8734.625,8747.438,According to our recent analysis the amount of money the United States spends on policing across the country is $115 billion which is the nearly every other country's military budget.,162,,
912,0.97,8747.438,8758.416,Police departments consistently have lower rates of solving crimes even as budgets are increasing threefold over the last 40 years.,162,,
913,0.97,8758.416,8769.761,"On the other hand, when police investigate a crime involving a black victim evidence shows the rate is still lower.",162,,
914,0.97,8769.761,8779.537,"We've heard some folks are demanding the Council Defund the police Department which could mean a lot of different things, one specific target we've heard is 50% and others are demanding we dismantle the police Department altogether.",162,,
915,0.97,8779.537,8792.55,The murder of George Floyd has spurred the conversation about the history of law enforcement as a Slave-Catching institution and what the history of the institution should be today.,162,,
916,0.97,8792.55,8810.201,In light of these national conversations the police response to demonstrations of the last nearly 2 weeks and the disparity in law enforcement that we see here in Seattle as well brings us to the table that chair Mosqueda is setting for these budget discussions.,162,,
917,0.97,8810.201,8827.718,"As it relates to some of the disparity that we see here, 2019 studies found black suspects were searched most, 26% of the time, and only 16% of the time were they found with weapons.",162,,
918,0.97,8827.718,8849.44,"Whites were searched the least, 18% of the time and were found with weapons 25% of the time so blacks were searched the most, were not found with weapons at the rate at which they were searched, and whites were searched the least and were more often found with weapons.",162,,
919,0.97,8849.44,8861.219,A 2019 study found that black people account for 32% of all uses of force with Firearm pointing rate of 26.6%.,162,,
920,0.97,8861.219,8864.455,White subjects had a Firearm pointing rate of 16.6%.,162,,
921,0.97,8864.455,8882.139,"The 4TH report issued in January finds that even though the number of force incidents has decreased, the use of force is still 28%, significantly higher than Seattle's black population.",162,,
922,0.97,8882.139,8893.084,Today's presentation will go into greater detail than we have ever seen before and is an opportunity to take apart the budget and Reimagine what a public safety Department may look like.,162,,
923,0.97,8893.084,8907.898,"As Councilmember Mosqueda mentioned in Camden New Jersey, they let go of all of their officers including the police chief and made them Reapply with a new Reimagined police Department.",162,,
924,0.97,8907.898,8920.978,"The Council will be looking for cuts to make in the budget to Reallocate to Community-Based alternatives, I think we have to realize that we have to have 2 different conversations.",162,,
925,0.97,8920.978,8943.701,"We have to have a conversation now about reductions in the police Department budget and Investmnt in Community-Based alternatives and have to create a roadmap for how to Reimagine and take what is now the police Department, and Reimagine it to be a real public safety apparatus for the city.",162,,
926,0.97,8943.701,8949.14,In Minneapolis they have committed to a One-Your process.,162,,
927,0.97,8949.14,8951.809,They are not abolishing the police Department today.,162,,
928,0.97,8951.809,8965.623,"City Councilmembers are saying they will gradually dismantle it and replace it with one that uses Healthcare workers and social workers instead of police officers to respond to substance abuse, homelessness, or mental health calls.",162,,
929,0.97,8965.623,8967.391,Violence prevention would be the work of Community-Based counselors.,162,,
930,0.97,8967.391,8987.345,What I hope we can have is a systematic questioning of the roles that police undertake and develop Evidence-Based alternatives so that we can Dialback reliance on police officers and identify the most effective approaches.,162,,
931,0.97,8987.345,9004.795,"For instance, we should do an analysis of 911 calls to see how many are for mental health distress or Overdose or disorder so that we can begin to determine whether or not we need SPD response in all cases, or substance abuse disorder professionals, conflict dispute resolution.",162,,
932,0.97,9004.795,9023.814,"One example that has already taken place in response to youth protest and the position of the Seattle teachers Union, the Seattle education Association and school board have expressed the intention of ending the practice of having armed school officers stationed across Seattle schools.",162,,
933,0.97,9023.814,9033.391,"South shore, Denny middle school in Washington middle school, all schools that are predominantly children of color.",162,,
934,0.97,9033.391,9066.157,"In the next 6 weeks for the 2020 budget to address a $300 million revenue shortfall, we will be focused on reducing the budget, use for Militarized police response and looking at the funding allocated by the budget for new hires, but not spent because of the difficult team meeting hiring goals . and, other funding that does not best serve the public safety needs of the community.",162,,
935,0.97,9066.157,9075.866,I think also as we've said we will begin a conversation about the hiring goals moving forward and whether or not reliance on growing the size of the Department is really the best way to make our city safer.,162,,
936,0.97,9075.866,9091.982,"More importantly, we will commit to investing funding and communities most harmed by involvement with law enforcement, black and Brown people and communities.",162,,
937,0.97,9091.982,9098.456,One step that the Council has taken is to create a community service officer program that went into effect later this year.,162,,
938,0.97,9098.456,9120.01,"The assist with mediating disputes falling off on calls for Nonemergency services, helping residents navigate services, support programming for at risk youth, and attending school and Community-Hosted event . Some--to access programs like opportunity housing and behavioral health services.",162,,
939,0.97,9120.01,9127.918,One study shows that law enforcement spends 21% of time responding to and transporting people with mental illness.,162,,
940,0.97,9127.918,9130.12,That cannot continue.,162,,
941,0.97,9130.12,9151.442,"As noted in the past release, announcing the CSO jobs it says SPD speaks 6 to fill positions with individuals from demographic groups currently Underrepresented including Elders, immigrants, individuals with past involvement in the criminal justice system.",162,,
942,0.97,9151.442,9154.712,"When the application was posted, the response was overwhelming.",162,,
943,0.97,9154.712,9162.653,There were thousands of people Eagle eager to participate in a different model of public safety in our city.,162,,
944,0.97,9162.653,9172.563,I read an article recently that I will close out with this quote from a Dallas chief David Brown.,162,,
945,0.97,9172.563,9184.575,He writes every societal failure we put on the cops to solve . This was several days after a sniper killed 5 officers in his city.,162,,
946,0.97,9184.575,9188.646,"Not enough mental health funding, let the cop handle it.",162,,
947,0.97,9188.646,9191.081,Not enough drug addiction?,162,,
948,0.97,9191.081,9192.283,Let's give it to the cops.,162,,
949,0.97,9192.283,9192.75,Schools fail?,162,,
950,0.97,9192.75,9193.684,Give it to the cops.,162,,
951,0.97,9193.684,9196.153,That is too much to ask.,162,,
952,0.97,9196.153,9198.189,Policing was never meant to solve all of those problems.,162,,
953,0.97,9198.189,9210.167,I just ask that other parts of the democracy--to help us.,162,,
954,0.97,9210.167,9222.947,"Closing out, I want to, again, highlight the questions we are going to be asking relating specifically to how much funding is available due to SPD not meeting prior hiring goals.",163,,
955,0.97,9222.947,9235.326,"How much of the adopted budget needs to be spent, a break down of 911 calls and the cost of school emphasis officers related to the Militarization of SPD.",163,,
956,0.97,9235.326,9246.537,"The years these are the questions sent this week . how much is spent annually on riot gear, tear graph gas and pepper spray?",163,,

958,0.97,9255.98,9264.021,What is the Per-Unit cost and where are such weapons Sourced from?,163,,
959,0.97,9264.021,9272.329,Approximately how much has been spent on these items so far?,163,,
960,0.97,9272.329,9283.474,They Brea out how much overtime has been used.,163,,
961,0.97,9283.474,9296.487,"Asking society to restock Non- lethal expendable weapons that I mentioned given the amounts that have been used, and if so, how much?",163,,
962,0.97,9296.487,9301.592,How much has the city spent on supporting National Guard members who have been working?,163,,
963,0.97,9301.592,9305.262,How much have they spent on supporting other law enforcement agencies who have been working at the protests?,163,,
964,0.97,9305.262,9326.784,And we are also going to have another conversation that has been queued up before I think in the select Committee on homelessness on funding being used in police Department encampment Removals.,163,,
965,0.97,9326.784,9330.02,"The number of officers, the number of hours on outreach?",163,,
966,0.97,9330.02,9369.827,"The number of hours spent on obstruction mitigation on encampment Removals? Then Lastly what has been called a 0-Based budget and using, again, the lens of racial equity to build it back up, Zero-Based budgeting means that all expenses must be justified for each new period based on need and the process starts from a 0 base.",163,,
967,0.97,9369.827,9379.37,Every single function would be analyzed for the need to achieve stated goals that we all agree on and the cost for those goals.,163,,

972,0.97,9415.906,9437.227,"Our discussion for today is not about Policy-Based questions but about the dollars that we are going to be Deliberating, and the use of those . It is very dense including a lot of information so I would like to allow for Councilmembers questions after staff presents each slide.",163,,
973,0.97,9437.227,9445.035,In the interest of time I would request you keep general comments for after the presentation.,163,,

978,0.97,9472.029,9483.974,"But Councilmembers, you both major general comments and my office has the strongest record on these issues and I insist on making these and I'm going to go ahead and make them.",168,,
979,0.97,9483.974,9504.495,"Yesterday we had an incredible rally of 2000 community members, many of whom have been on the front lines for the last 10 days that was immediately set off by the George Floyd murder but reflects Long-Standing issues of race, Endemic racism in police violence.",168,,
980,0.97,9504.495,9514.004,"We have incredibly dynamic speakers from the central district, black community leaders who have been looking for decades.",168,,
981,0.97,9514.004,9529.953,"We had speakers from the Seattle educational Association, the Union that has just voted to remove from the labor Council, and in fact, the speaker was an African-American member of the educators Association.",168,,
982,0.97,9529.953,9548.739,And he is a teacher . We had Logan swan presenting a petition to remove the Seattle police officers from the labor Council.,168,,
983,0.97,9548.739,9559.149,"As my office has said, we stand with local community and demanding the Seattle police he Defunded at least 50%.",168,,

985,0.97,9568.258,9580.07,We also support the King County equity now coalition to become the William girls sector for enterprise.,168,,
986,0.97,9580.07,9583.874,But we also need an elected community oversight board with full powers of the police.,168,,
987,0.97,9583.874,9585.676,This is not what we have.,168,,
988,0.97,9585.676,9601.391,We don't want committees or commissions appointed by city Council and the Mayor and the same coalitions that have failed . We need a community oversight board directly elected by voters.,168,,
989,0.97,9601.391,9605.262,We have seen the statistics.,168,,
990,0.97,9605.262,9610.767,30 black and Brown community members have been murdered by Seattle police since 2011 and not one has been prosecuted.,168,,

998,0.97,9679.136,9712.102,"I never brought something so bold, these Councilmembers voted against even very modest Defunding of the police Department, vote after vote against the people's budget proposals for stopping these Sweeps so we have to make sure that our movement does not develop Delusions and establishments that have failed us before and is public, and said, cannot put faith in an establishment that brought us here in the first place.",168,,

1001,0.97,9729.953,9744.0,"We see this language being Co- opted by politicians that it will dismantle, but what does it really mean?",168,,

1029,0.97,9985.675,9997.52,She told me how much work you are doing . Thank you for the introduction Councilmember Herbold.,172,,
1030,0.97,9997.52,10012.502,"As you mentioned, I am joined today by some colleagues from the city budget office and also by Angela who is the executive director for budget and finance for the Seattle police Department.",172,,
1031,0.97,10012.502,10021.878,Before I get started I want to thank Angela and Cara for the work that they have done on this presentation over the last 48 hours.,172,,
1032,0.97,10021.878,10030.82,It is really a monumental feat because the accounting and budget systems do not always provide in a way that is easily understandable or presentable.,172,,
1033,0.97,10030.82,10043.8,Complex data like the sealed police Department budget . It is fantastic they were able to devote the time to do it and I am very pleased to work with them.,172,,
1034,0.97,10043.8,10050.006,They are 2 of the most confident and Hard-Working colleagues that I've had and I just want to thank them for their work in the last few days.,172,,
1035,0.97,10050.006,10061.484,Finally I want all of you to know that the 3 of us stand by to provide you with whatever information you need as you undertake the process of examining the police Department and the type of work done by police officers.,172,,
1036,0.97,10061.484,10062.118,Thank you.,173,,

1038,0.97,10073.663,10082.372,It looks like the monitor that has it going from small--I think that's it.,173,,
1039,0.97,10082.372,10084.841,Does that work?,173,,
1040,0.97,10084.841,10090.747,Somebody else may be able to help but let's go ahead.,173,,
1041,0.97,10090.747,10092.082,Go ahead Councilmember Herbold.,173,,
1042,0.97,10092.082,10105.762,"I just wanted to figure out, I don't think we connected on this portion, as we have Councilmember questions after each slide, is that something you want to manage or should I manage that?",174,,
1043,0.97,10105.762,10110.4,You are not welcome to.,175,,

1046,0.97,10128.718,10135.859,"Councilmember Herbold, I'm also happy to identify folks because I know you have a lot of questions.",177,,
1047,0.97,10135.859,10138.394,If that's helpful I can help manage folks raising their hands.,177,,
1048,0.97,10138.394,10143.733,"So, is this a better view of the presentation?",178,,
1049,0.97,10143.733,10146.803,Not from my perspective.,179,,
1050,0.97,10146.803,10159.315,For some reason on the right it is a column with your picture and it's cutting off half of the presentation.,179,,
1051,0.97,10159.315,10160.617,Okay.,180,,
1052,0.97,10160.617,10171.127,"So when I expand, like so, you can see the whole presentation but it's smaller, I'm guessing?",180,,
1053,0.97,10171.127,10174.23,Yes.,181,,
1054,0.97,10174.23,10175.832,I can manage with this.,181,,
1055,0.97,10175.832,10179.269,I don't know about other Councilmembers.,181,,
1056,0.97,10179.269,10181.738,"I think it looks good, let's go for it.",182,,
1057,0.97,10181.738,10188.244,I'm going to go ahead and start with the first slide and hopefully you can see this.,183,,
1058,0.97,10188.244,10211.167,What you are looking at here is an overview of the entire budget and I'm going to spend a few minutes Familiarizing you with the various expenditure categories and as we move further into the presentation you will find that I have slides for line by line detail for each of these categories.,183,,
1059,0.97,10211.167,10215.405,I'm going to start out with personnel.,183,,
1060,0.97,10215.405,10219.108,I don't know if you can see these numbers so I'm going to read them.,183,,
1061,0.97,10219.108,10222.912,Personnel here is just salaries and benefits.,183,,
1062,0.97,10222.912,10232.488,That total for the Seattle police Department is about $306 million and represents about 75% of the entire budget.,183,,
1063,0.97,10232.488,10244.901,Those are salaries and benefits that support about 2000 employees and we are going to be going a little later into how employees are broken down in the Department.,183,,
1064,0.97,10244.901,10254.444,"But, that is by far, the largest expense as you can see.",183,,
1065,0.97,10254.444,10257.847,The next largest expense is overtime and that figure is about $30 million.,183,,
1066,0.97,10257.847,10261.951,"Here in this case that is about 7%, this chunk here.",183,,
1067,0.97,10261.951,10274.564,"When you take the entire overtime and Salary/Benefit budget, this piece here, you have now covered about 82% of the Seattle police Department budget.",183,,
1068,0.97,10274.564,10287.343,"So put simply, 82% of $400 million is paying for salary and benefits, and overtime salary for 2000 city employees.",183,,
1069,0.97,10287.343,10291.147,Then we will get into some of the Non-Personnel charges.,183,,
1070,0.97,10291.147,10298.254,The largest Non-Personnel charge is what we would call Interfund charges.,183,,
1071,0.97,10298.254,10303.192,"Interfund charges, as you can see, are for fleets and facilities.",183,,
1072,0.97,10303.192,10321.077,"For vehicles, Seattle it, all of the it professionals that are technically part of the Seattle it Department . For hr, judgment claims, citywide functions that SPD has to pay for it.",183,,
1073,0.97,10321.077,10331.621,"These are functions that are provided to SPD but not part of SPD, per se, and as you can see, that amount is $57 million.",183,,
1074,0.97,10331.621,10350.907,"Working my way down, if you take the salary and benefits of personnel and you take the Interfund charges, again fleets, facilities, it, you are now up to 96% of the Seattle police Department budget.",183,,
1075,0.97,10350.907,10357.413,What you have left is a very small fraction of the budget.,183,,
1076,0.97,10357.413,10369.959,"The money used for equipment, professional services, for travel, training, and you can see I have these categories here of discretionary purchase accounts coming to $5 million.",183,,
1077,0.97,10369.959,10379.969,Professional services to $6 million and travel and training comes down to about $1 million.,183,,
1078,0.97,10379.969,10391.748,"What you are looking at, the money that SPD actually has control over spending Besides the salary benefits and overtime, is about $12 million and about 3% of the budget.",183,,
1079,0.97,10391.748,10413.703,"As I've said before, later in this presentation I have for each one of these line items, detailed line by line budgets that will show you exactly how this money is spent and distributed by section and by personnel throughout the Department.",183,,
1080,0.97,10413.703,10416.906,With that I will stop and ask if there are any questions on this particular slide.,183,,
1081,0.97,10416.906,10418.307,"Thank you, yes.",184,,
1082,0.97,10418.307,10425.081,Councilmembers Morales and Andrew Lewis in the Queue.,184,,
1083,0.97,10425.081,10433.189,Can everyone hear me?,185,,
1084,0.97,10433.189,10441.531,"I got kicked off my computer and him on my phone now, another reason we need municipal Broadband but that's another conversation.",185,,
1085,0.97,10441.531,10452.108,"I do have a conversation about the information on slide one, particularly the Interfund charges.",185,,
1086,0.97,10452.108,10457.346,We have heard the last couple of mayors talking about becoming a smart city.,185,,
1087,0.97,10457.346,10460.416,I wonder if you can break down the it line in particular.,185,,
1088,0.97,10460.416,10465.855,I'm interested in what kind of technology is in this item.,185,,
1089,0.97,10465.855,10469.559,"What is the data being collected, how is it collected, who has access, what is done with that.",185,,
1090,0.97,10469.559,10481.137,And then if there is a percentage of that that includes surveillance or if that is somewhere else in the budget.,185,,
1091,0.97,10481.137,10497.186,I can start by answering your questions to say we do have a breakdown of the Interfund charges and I can skip ahead and show you a break down now.,186,,
1092,0.97,10497.186,10498.087,Unless you prefer --,186,,
1093,0.97,10498.087,10514.604,"If it's okay, let's stick with--with a Snapshot and go deeper on that item if that is okay with Councilmember Morales?",187,,
1094,0.97,10514.604,10515.671,That's fine.,188,,
1095,0.97,10515.671,10520.51,"I don't see that it is covered but I'm happy to wait, that's fine.",188,,
1096,0.97,10520.51,10524.38,Appreciate it.,189,,
1097,0.97,10524.38,10530.286,And Councilmember Lewis had a question as well.,190,,
1098,0.97,10530.286,10537.193,"Greg, this may be something you are going to cover later as well so feel free to flag that but I was curious in these categories.",191,,
1099,0.97,10537.193,10545.601,One of the recent big equipment purchases for SPD has been body worn cameras for all patrol officers.,191,,
1100,0.97,10545.601,10553.042,I'm just kind of curious if that lives in this budget or if that is somewhere else.,191,,
1101,0.97,10553.042,10562.018,"And if that's coming later that's fine, but I'm curious if those--of those.",191,,
1102,0.97,10562.018,10568.457,I think for that I will have to turn to the SPD budget director.,192,,
1103,0.97,10568.457,10575.965,"I'm not sure if that lives with it allocations or SPD, so Angela, is that something you may know about?",192,,
1104,0.97,10575.965,10576.365,Yes.,193,,
1105,0.97,10576.365,10597.286,"To bring some clarity to this particular line, the Interfund charges, these are all set by the manual so specific it items, things like body worn Video are built into it rates just like they are for every city Department.",193,,
1106,0.97,10597.286,10608.698,"In the case of the Body-Worn Video system, there was a project for the Rollout and implementation.",193,,
1107,0.97,10608.698,10627.416,"In that case, Seattle it, we don't have a capital improvement project budget in our Department so that was funded in Seattle it, the subscription costs associated with the program.",193,,
1108,0.97,10627.416,10633.823,Also the budget for that also lives in Seattle it.,193,,
1109,0.97,10633.823,10638.494,"As a follow-up, does that come in on the Interfund tab?",194,,
1110,0.97,10638.494,10642.131,Is that what I'm hearing?,194,,
1111,0.97,10642.131,10644.433,Kind of.,195,,
1112,0.97,10644.433,10685.775,"The Interfund rates are set--again, the central cost manual is about 100 pages long and describes how they count total number of devices and in the case of Body-Worn Video I think 100% of subscription costs are likely built into that number because it is an SPD . My guess is I can confirm that to you but my guess is it will be included in our it Interfund.",195,,
1113,0.97,10685.775,10692.281,"Councilmember Morales, another question please?",196,,
1114,0.97,10692.281,10708.998,Can you tell me where of these categories will be school resource officers in the expenditure and funded by General revenue.,197,,
1115,0.97,10708.998,10734.223,"We are going to get into some of the more detailed level categories a little bit later but the school resource officers are part of the personnel costs that $306 million, and they are technically part of the Bureau name escaping me . I want to say it is community outreach Bureau.",198,,
1116,0.97,10734.223,10736.125,What is the name of the Bureau?,198,,
1117,0.97,10736.125,10739.929,"Collaborative policing, thank you.",199,,
1118,0.97,10739.929,10743.933,It used to be community outreach years ago.,199,,
1119,0.97,10743.933,10753.509,They are part of the collaborative policing Bureau.,199,,
1120,0.97,10753.509,10757.947,Going to move on to the 2ND slide.,200,,
1121,0.97,10757.947,10771.36,"As you saw, the largest chunk of SPD budget is salaries and benefits so we wanted to show you how that breaks out between civilians.",200,,
1122,0.97,10771.36,10779.335,"You have here in the first column the sworn numbers and in the 2ND, the civilian numbers, and the total at the end.",200,,
1123,0.97,10779.335,10797.386,"Starting with sworn, there are 1424 positions that are sworn positions that are funded and that is about 71% of all personnel in the Department.",200,,
1124,0.97,10797.386,10812.401,The share of salaries and benefits as you can see is about 77% . The 1424 I will talk about a little bit.,200,,
1125,0.97,10812.401,10833.322,It is funded FTE for sworn and it is a little bit misleading because it also includes recruits and recruits are technically not sworn but the number includes all the folks that are sworn or going to be sworn.,200,,
1126,0.97,10833.322,10843.499,"Regarding Councilmember Herbold's question about money for sworn and whether or not that has been affected by the Covid crisis, I will go ahead and address that now.",200,,
1127,0.97,10843.499,10845.134,It has.,200,,
1128,0.97,10845.134,10853.042,The Department is now bumping up against its number of 1424.,200,,
1129,0.97,10853.042,10870.726,"What has happened in the last several months is, and this is expected in any recession, recruiting has picked up dramatically and separations have stopped . or not stopped, but very much slowed down.",200,,
1130,0.97,10870.726,10884.94,"If you were to look through the month of April in this year you would see that SPD has made 40 recruit hires, could've lateral hires for a total of 32 in this area here and they have only had 17 separations.",200,,
1131,0.97,10884.94,10896.085,So that kind of disparity has been unseen for a very long amount of time.,200,,
1132,0.97,10896.085,10898.354,It likely reflects the recession.,200,,
1133,0.97,10898.354,10940.195,"It's hard to know for sure, but what it is doing is creating a situation where SPD is essentially, it doesn't have any more money to hire more people so what the Department is going to be doing over the next 3 months is to discontinue hiring recruits . that is happening partially because as I've said, they are bumping up against their funded FTE level and is also happening because practical Covid reasons . The tests that officers would take to move them into the recruitment system, there are, of course, getting hundreds of people together to take a test.",200,,
1134,0.97,10940.195,10943.432,The Department expects it will have to take a break on hiring recruits for a few months.,200,,
1135,0.97,10943.432,10961.317,"If things are to turn to normal according to the staffing plan this fall, SPD would resume hiring of recruits and would have enough money to hire 7 recruits in each of the last 3 months of this year.",200,,
1136,0.97,10961.317,10989.345,If everything returns to normal and they are able to test and get recruits they will be looking at making 21 hires towards a sworn force . that is sort of a high-level overview of the hiring situation . I think what is inherent is that there is not money left over right now because the Department has not been able to hire.,200,,
1137,0.97,10989.345,10995.985,That was certainly 100% true until the recession and now it is completely up and in.,200,,
1138,0.97,10995.985,11013.902,"Greg, when you say the Department is bumping up against its funded hires, are you talking about for this period of time or the entire year?",201,,
1139,0.97,11013.902,11041.697,"I'm saying that according to the staffing plan, this month at the end of June they will have 1424 filled FTE and if they do not hire for the next 3 months, and there are a few more separations, then they will be able to start hiring again and have the money to hire again in the fall.",202,,
1140,0.97,11041.697,11047.636,I just wanted to Re-Ask my question because I didn't hear an answer.,203,,
1141,0.97,11047.636,11051.907,The 1420S the goal for what period of time?,203,,
1142,0.97,11051.907,11058.147,Through the end of this year or just up to the 2ND quarter of 2020?,203,,
1143,0.97,11058.147,11066.622,"That is the number of funded FTE--FTE, and analyze number.",204,,
1144,0.97,11066.622,11073.028,It is an annualized number but we break it down for purposes of tracking recruitment.,205,,
1145,0.97,11073.028,11082.371,"I didn't know if you are using he number that we break by quarter for purposes of tracking recruitment, or if you are using the annualized budget numbers, O thank you.",205,,
1146,0.97,11082.371,11084.973,Anything to add?,206,,
1147,0.97,11084.973,11088.977,"Well yes, I guess.",207,,
1148,0.97,11088.977,11098.854,This represents a departure from past product this where we try to anticipate attrition and higher in advance of that.,207,,
1149,0.97,11098.854,11140.429,"Given financial constraints this year we opted to--and it ends up being a 4-month hiring freeze, we have opted to instead of Pre-Hiring in anticipation of separations, we felt from a budget standpoint that we do have a pool of approved candidates that we are holding on and felt it wise to monitor attrition and see that we were not hiring over and above what we were actually separating.",207,,
1150,0.97,11140.429,11143.932,Any other questions or should I move on?,208,,
1151,0.97,11143.932,11156.712,I do not see any raised hands or received text from my colleagues.,209,,
1152,0.97,11156.712,11159.781,I have not figured out how to get everyone's heads showing.,209,,
1153,0.97,11163.185,11168.056,I did send a text message.,209,,
1154,0.97,11168.056,11169.525,No problem at all.,210,,
1155,0.97,11169.525,11203.258,"Just a quick question to clarify some information and make sure that I have it right, just to understand moving forward, did you say there were 40 new sworn officers that were hired in April and during that time there were 17 who quit, so basically a net expansion of 23 sworn officers? that is one question, did I get that right?",210,,
1156,0.97,11203.258,11217.873,"And also, I'm not clear because, I'm not clear how hiring is going on for new sworn officers because hasn't there been a hiring freeze that has taken effect for all of the other city of Seattle departments?",210,,
1157,0.97,11217.873,11224.179,"And to put a point on that, the office of labor standards which does really important work has been Understaffed for months.",210,,
1158,0.97,11224.179,11231.887,That doesn't even have anything to do with the recession that much.,210,,
1159,0.97,11231.887,11257.846,"So the office of civil rights, for instance, has open positions they have not filled so it seems like quite the contrast that other departments have now had a hiring freeze and many of those same departments who had long time hiring problems but yet Seattle police Department has hired at least 23 new sworn officers in April during Covid?",210,,
1160,0.97,11257.846,11264.353,"To clarify one point, it is the entire year through April.",211,,
1161,0.97,11264.353,11270.659,Those are the Actuals in the last staffing report.,211,,
1162,0.97,11270.659,11284.573,"It takes a while for them to catch up, so the last staffing report transmitted to the Council was a net of 40 officers hired--actually I should say 40 recruits hired, 2 lateral officers, and 17 separations.",211,,
1163,0.97,11284.573,11287.943,That's for the first several months this year through April.,211,,
1164,0.97,11287.943,11308.263,My recollection is that I thought that I heard from the public safety service Commission that they were suspending testing because of Covid-19 concerns but I may be remembering an error.,212,,
1165,0.97,11308.263,11316.004,I thought I remembered hearing from them sometime in Maybe the last month or so.,212,,
1166,0.97,11316.004,11351.54,"I think that's entirely possible and as I alluded to earlier I have heard from the Department that testing is going to be a problem and of course that is another reason potentially why they are going on a 4-month recruit hiring freeze . in terms of folks that had been brought on board since January, the way the hiring system works, the tests happen only a few times a year and they get a great bunch of candidates.",213,,
1167,0.97,11351.54,11374.062,"I will ask Angela to tell me if I'm wrong but my guess is that the folks coming on over the last few months came from the last test Pre-Covid and it takes a wild to get them back ground and interviewed so I think the 40 and the 2 that came on anytime between the beginning of the year and April, I suspect came from tests that happened prior to Covid.",213,,
1168,0.97,11374.062,11376.732,A question from chair Mosqueda.,214,,
1169,0.97,11376.732,11379.768,Thank you.,215,,
1170,0.97,11379.768,11409.498,"This may be something we can look into later but I am concerned about the overall recruitment strategy and understand there is a heavy emphasis on military events and things like that and perhaps we don't need to get into that question right now because it's more policy oriented, but if there is an element that is not tied to things like that it would be helpful for me to know.",215,,
1171,0.97,11409.498,11414.069,There is a budget element tied to recruitment.,216,,
1172,0.97,11414.069,11423.211,I think the Department would probably answer the question you are asking separately from this presentation.,216,,
1173,0.97,11423.211,11440.896,I know they have been boasting that they had the highest level of recruits of people of color in this last year but I don't know that that speaks to your question as to whether or not they are mostly going to military events . that is something I think they will need to answer.,216,,
1174,0.97,11440.896,11441.363,Appreciated.,217,,
1175,0.97,11441.363,11443.732,We can do that later if you'd like.,217,,
1176,0.97,11443.732,11445.567,We will get back to you on that.,218,,
1177,0.97,11445.567,11451.606,Another question from Council member Morales.,219,,
1178,0.97,11451.606,11454.91,"Nope, sorry.",220,,
1179,0.97,11454.91,11460.215,"I'm looking ahead to slide 9, thank you.",220,,
1180,0.97,11460.215,11462.751,Let's move ahead to slide and then.,221,,
1181,0.97,11462.751,11463.418,Perfect.,221,,
1182,0.97,11463.418,11470.959,[Laughter] going to slide 3 unless you want me to skip to slide 9 --,222,,
1183,0.97,11470.959,11472.561,[Laughter],223,,
1184,0.97,11472.561,11479.868,"That's okay, I'm just trying to get into the Queue, sorry everybody.",224,,
1185,0.97,11479.868,11499.788,"This is one that we through in here to give you a flavor of how much it costs to pay for all of those folks that are responsible for 75% of the salary and benefits, or 75% of the budget at Spe--SPD.",225,,
1186,0.97,11499.788,11505.694,What you can see is the top 10 job titles in the number of FTE in this column for each title.,225,,
1187,0.97,11505.694,11516.671,"The salary and the benefits for that particular category of employee, and the average cost of that particular category of employee.",225,,
1188,0.97,11516.671,11524.579,"What you are looking at here in the green are civilians and the blue, of course, is sworn.",225,,
1189,0.97,11524.579,11564.619,"To give you an example of the kind of cost disparity that you will see here, you will see civilians are obviously in the Low-100S . for the parking enforcement officers about 100,000 and you go up to about 113 for the dispatcher 2 level as opposed to police officer patrol . The smallest is 150 and of course that is the highest group and as you work your way down you have a lieutenant which will typically cost a couple hundred thousand dollars per Lieutenant.",225,,
1190,0.97,11564.619,11569.457,This of course is salaries and benefits.,225,,
1191,0.97,11569.457,11573.628,"This is the cost of say, when the tenant.",225,,
1192,0.97,11573.628,11580.835,Could use a ballpark what percentage of that average cost is salaries alone?,226,,
1193,0.97,11580.835,11584.072,I can't but Angela can.,227,,
1194,0.97,11584.072,11588.777,"We talked about it earlier so Angela, you are up.",227,,
1195,0.97,11588.777,11603.592,On average it's about 30% -35% . If you were to look at all employees . because the benefit structure for sworn is so different from civilians it is definitely worth calling those out.,228,,
1196,0.97,11603.592,11617.205,For the sworn employee you are looking at 25% on average for benefits and for the civilian employees actually about 48%.,228,,
1197,0.97,11617.205,11619.608,What accounts for that difference?,229,,
1198,0.97,11619.608,11626.114,The sworn are different in that they don't pay into the same retirement fund.,230,,
1199,0.97,11626.114,11637.425,"They don't pay into social security, their Healthcare costs, Healthcare is different than most city employees.",230,,
1200,0.97,11637.425,11640.729,Healthcare is less.,230,,
1201,0.97,11640.729,11642.597,"I mean, it's just the structure of the benefits.",230,,
1202,0.97,11642.597,11645.033,Thank you.,231,,
1203,0.97,11645.033,11647.802,Council member Mosqueda?,232,,
1204,0.97,11647.802,11649.704,Sorry.,232,,
1205,0.97,11649.704,11662.05,"On the Healthcare piece I want to double check . is there a line item that we have seen grow over time for access to mental health services, suicide prevention?",233,,
1206,0.97,11662.05,11670.425,We know that like many first responders there is a high rate of suicide and that's a very large issue.,233,,
1207,0.97,11670.425,11691.946,I condemn the comments that are making it sound like anybody should be not doing their best to get access to Healthcare to prevent self harm or suicide.,233,,
1208,0.97,11691.946,11699.888,"People having access to those services and recognizing the high rates especially among firefighters, for example, something I've worked on for a long time to make sure those on the front line have access to services and trauma treatment.",233,,
1209,0.97,11699.888,11706.361,I'm sure there are a lot of folks who have seen and heard a lot of traumatic things or done some traumatic things.,233,,
1210,0.97,11706.361,11721.009,Is there a specific line item that we have seen grow over time to increase funding for mental health services and suicide prevention strategies?,233,,
1211,0.97,11721.009,11725.313,"It sounds to me like you are speaking about mental health and suicide prevention strategies for officers, is that correct?",234,,
1212,0.97,11725.313,11726.381,That's correct.,235,,
1213,0.97,11726.381,11737.025,I think that is a city service and I think SPD has peer counseling available.,236,,
1214,0.97,11737.025,11740.929,Angela is there any money specifically set aside or is it citywide?,236,,
1215,0.97,11740.929,11751.84,There is the employee assistance program which all city employees pay a small amount for all city employees as a central service.,237,,
1216,0.97,11751.84,11766.254,We do have dedicated peer support employees embedded within the police Department and then a cadre of others who are specially trained to respond and direct people.,237,,
1217,0.97,11766.254,11779.868,A lot of it is we don't have a specific budget line for that outside of the employees who work either full-time or Part- time on that topic.,237,,
1218,0.97,11779.868,11788.843,"Officers to have access, however, 2, I believe primarily nonprofit organizations targeted at law enforcement.",237,,
1219,0.97,11788.843,11797.786,I want to say it is code for the service that we utilize where they have access to counseling services and Whatnot.,237,,
1220,0.97,11797.786,11806.461,Within the budget you are not going to find a large dollar amount associated with that specific issue.,237,,
1221,0.97,11806.461,11810.598,"Okay, thank you.",238,,
1222,0.97,11810.598,11812.8,Councilmember Lewis you have a question please?,239,,
1223,0.97,11812.8,11814.802,Thank you.,240,,
1224,0.97,11814.802,11843.097,"Greg, maybe this will come later but I wanted to ask for the purposes of comparison, obviously community service officers are not one of the top positions in the Department but I do think as chair Herbold, public safety chair highlighted in her opening remarks this sort of model of the unarmed community service officer and the kind of interventions they provide.",240,,
1225,0.97,11843.097,11860.348,"It may form a big part of the decisions we may want to take on as a Council . I'm kind of curious where they fall in the scheme of this and I don't remember from January when the committee did a little bit of work hearing about the Rollout of that plan, on if they are or are not sworn.",240,,
1226,0.97,11860.348,11863.284,I think they are not sworn but if you could clarify that as well?,240,,
1227,0.97,11863.284,11883.871,"They are not and in the last budget round we added 6 more, I believe, for a total of 18 and gosh, I am blinking on the Per- person salary and benefit rate and I'm hoping Angela might know.",241,,
1228,0.97,11883.871,11891.379,"For the community service officers you are looking at about $100,000 per employee for the community service officers.",242,,
1229,0.97,11891.379,11894.682,Supervisors obviously slightly more.,242,,
1230,0.97,11894.682,11903.992,Is that inclusive of the whole package? it would be about the same as a patrol officer in terms of cost?,243,,
1231,0.97,11903.992,11910.298,"The 100,000 includes salary and benefits.",244,,
1232,0.97,11910.298,11919.474,Obviously there's going to be some overhead involved in terms of vehicles and office space and Whatnot that would increase the cost.,244,,
1233,0.97,11919.474,11928.583,"I do not have that on hand but if you are talking about the individual employee, it's about $100,000 whereas a patrol officer is about 150.",244,,
1234,0.97,11928.583,11935.089,Thank you.,245,,
1235,0.97,11935.089,11938.092,I don't see any more questions for this slide.,246,,
1236,0.97,11938.092,11953.975,"This site is designed to show you where the civilians are and where the sworn are in the Department . and, sort of give you a visual understanding of the ratio.",247,,
1237,0.97,11953.975,11970.658,"There is probably not a lot here that isn't intuitive so I will not spend too much time on this, but the green is the civilians and the blue, of course, is the sworn.",247,,
1238,0.97,11970.658,11974.529,Taking a look at this particular column you are looking at patrol operations which is all of the precincts.,247,,
1239,0.97,11974.529,11982.437,It makes sense that you would have 865 officers and 19 civilians.,247,,
1240,0.97,11982.437,11988.276,The 19 civilians are pretty much support personnel at this point.,247,,
1241,0.97,11988.276,11993.381,"These numbers, I should note, are the authorized positions which gets a little confusing.",247,,
1242,0.97,11993.381,12025.079,"They are not all completely funded because the Council and the executives have taken advantage of some vacancy rates but if they were fully funded and the Department was fully staffed then this is where the positions would be and you know, going over these at a high level, the chief of police, of course, that is the public disclosure unit and is a rather large civilian unit.",247,,
1243,0.97,12025.079,12038.493,"I think in 2017 they were taking about 6200 public disclosure requests a year so records, files, those are primarily civilian sections.",247,,
1244,0.97,12038.493,12041.329,Office of police accountability you are pretty familiar with.,247,,
1245,0.97,12041.329,12046.801,Actually it is more civilian than it is sworn.,247,,
1246,0.97,12046.801,12063.684,"Leadership and administration, you have education data center, human resources, actually I'm sorry, that's where records files is . You have more administrative functions and that's why, again, you have more of the civilians.",247,,
1247,0.97,12063.684,12067.955,As I've said I'm not owing to go through this column by column.,247,,
1248,0.97,12067.955,12071.793,I think most of it is intuitive.,247,,
1249,0.97,12071.793,12077.265,Special operations you have sort of a combination of traffic and parking enforcement officers.,247,,
1250,0.97,12077.265,12081.669,You have more of an equal share and wanted to give you a visual.,247,,
1251,0.97,12081.669,12095.55,Actually Angela put this together and I think it is super helpful and where civilians are and where the sworn are.,247,,
1252,0.97,12095.55,12105.493,So this is a slide that you have seen before in my annual budget Hesitations.,247,,
1253,0.97,12105.493,12113.801,"What you are seeing here is of the sworn force, how they are broken out.",247,,
1254,0.97,12113.801,12121.309,As you can see the patrol which is the first 3 categories here it is just under half.,247,,
1255,0.97,12121.309,12124.412,48.7%.,247,,
1256,0.97,12124.412,12140.828,"If you are looking at the Department you have about one third, 34.3% that respond to 911 calls and you also have sergeants and patrol and some specialty units and patrol.",247,,
1257,0.97,12140.828,12153.841,These are your community police team or other bikes officers that are on the street so that gives you a sense of how many are working with the public.,247,,
1258,0.97,12153.841,12164.418,And then you have Non-Patrol and in that section you have examples of investigative units.,247,,
1259,0.97,12164.418,12167.855,I think we probably all understand what we are looking at there.,247,,
1260,0.97,12167.855,12177.165,"Criminal investigations, narcotics, special the rooms, all of the criminal investigations sections you might expect.",247,,
1261,0.97,12177.165,12181.068,Specialty units.,247,,
1262,0.97,12181.068,12207.695,"These are the units that are specifically focused and one area and in this area you have Swat, canine, arson, bomb, and as I've said, each of these that I've pointed out, later on we have specific detail on how many people are in those units and how much, how many FTE are in those units.",247,,
1263,0.97,12207.695,12223.511,We even have a budget right down by how many discretionary dollars those units have . We can dig into that today or you can dig into them later and ask questions at another time.,247,,
1264,0.97,12223.511,12228.983,"Just to finish this, operation support is training folks.",247,,
1265,0.97,12228.983,12233.02,There are a lot of folks involved in training.,247,,
1266,0.97,12233.02,12240.394,"Policy, leadership being command staff and administration.",247,,
1267,0.97,12240.394,12246.701,"That is officers say, for instance, stationed in human resources or other places.",247,,
1268,0.97,12246.701,12253.941,This is really a statement of policy that the Department is making when you look at this slide.,247,,
1269,0.97,12253.941,12271.259,They are saying this is how they choose to dedicate the sworn force and this has everything to do with performance measures on the 911 side . They have to do with call response times.,247,,
1270,0.97,12271.259,12284.872,"It has to do with Proactive contact made with the public, to the investigative side when you have case clearance on murder cases, cases, etc.",247,,
1271,0.97,12284.872,12290.478,This is very much a policy statement and why I put the slide before you.,247,,
1272,0.97,12290.478,12311.499,"As it relates to this being a reflection of SPD policy on how to allocate resources, are there best practices for departments that are embracing community policing models?",248,,
1273,0.97,12311.499,12323.978,Everyone says they are a community policing Department but I think rather or not you really are is about how you spend your resources and what you have officers doing.,248,,
1274,0.97,12323.978,12340.828,"So, I'm wondering if there is something we could compare these percentages to as it relates to how a department would allocate resources if it was truly doing community placing.",248,,
1275,0.97,12340.828,12343.597,That's a good question.,249,,
1276,0.97,12343.597,12348.235,I think that is something we are going to have to get back to you on.,249,,
1277,0.97,12348.235,12375.463,"Community policing in the sense that officers would come into contact with the public, there are Metrics around 911 responses in Proactive time but I think the larger question you are asking about is how resources are divided so that community policing objectives can be achieved . I would want to give that one to Dr. Fisher at SPD.",249,,
1278,0.97,12375.463,12380.968,"That works for me, thanks.",250,,
1279,0.97,12380.968,12384.171,I'm not going to spend much time on this one.,251,,
1280,0.97,12384.171,12394.782,This is the precinct staffing report in case you are curious as to how these folks were broken out by precinct.,251,,
1281,0.97,12394.782,12398.853,These are the numbers as of the last report.,251,,
1282,0.97,12398.853,12400.054,It's not really budget related.,251,,
1283,0.97,12400.054,12406.36,Again just doing sort of a dive into SPD personnel.,251,,
1284,0.97,12406.36,12418.506,"Along with that, I have been asked to talk a bit about 911 response in service call data so I'm throwing up this slide.",251,,
1285,0.97,12418.506,12448.035,"It is not necessarily budget related, again, it in the overall picture of examining a speedy Metrics, and in terms of what they are trying to achieve from a public safety standpoint, these are good numbers to look at and as you can see in 2018 there were 138,000 Proactive call counts and times that officers made Proactive engagement with the citizen.",251,,
1286,0.97,12448.035,12458.546,"I can tell you that in each year there are 222,009 11 responses.",251,,
1287,0.97,12458.546,12464.251,That is not on the slide but the time that it takes folks to respond to 911 is on the slide.,251,,
1288,0.97,12464.251,12481.869,"As you can see, in 2019 it was about 8.77 minutes so the number of folks that you have on the street or in cars available to respond to 911 calls obviously will impact these numbers.",251,,
1289,0.97,12481.869,12492.479,The numbers of folks that you have either on the street around bike or on feet will impact the Proactive call counts.,251,,
1290,0.97,12492.479,12502.189,Councilmember her bold Herbold mentioned you have asked for a breakout of calls by type.,251,,
1291,0.97,12502.189,12510.965,That would be some really good data especially when you are considering the role that police play in answering 911 calls.,251,,
1292,0.97,12510.965,12517.404,"As you know, not all 911 calls are crimes in progress.",251,,
1293,0.97,12517.404,12520.908,"Some of them, quite a few actually are about folks that are in distress.",251,,
1294,0.97,12520.908,12557.645,"One number I would throw out and I think it's kind of an old number, but back in, I believe 2018, the Crt team, a team of police with mental health professionals went out on 1476 calls so that is an example of a situation where a 911 call came in and may have been a person in distress and the mental health professional that went along with the team was obviously help in that situation.",251,,
1295,0.97,12557.645,12559.914,So we are absolutely going to get that data for you.,251,,
1296,0.97,12559.914,12560.915,Thank you so much.,252,,
1297,0.97,12560.915,12568.656,"To restate what we see, the number of calls have gone down between 2016 and 2019.",253,,
1298,0.97,12568.656,12577.364,The number of hours spent Anwering those has gone down and the response time has gone down as well.,253,,
1299,0.97,12577.364,12601.155,"We want to see that there is a good response time and this is an area that I know councils in the past have had concerns about, reducing the response times noting, of course, that there is a difference between the median and average response times.",253,,
1300,0.97,12601.155,12623.777,Thank you for flagging my strong interest in drilling down on the different types of 911 calls . I think what would be really helpful before you get us that data is let us know what the categories are that we can expect to see so that we know that if there are other questions we should be asking.,253,,
1301,0.97,12623.777,12633.22,Here the count is Proactive so this is a situation where officers are engaging with folks.,254,,
1302,0.97,12633.22,12638.525,I'm not sure if they keep track of the issues they were engaging on but we will definitely ask the question.,254,,
1303,0.97,12638.525,12643.53,The top part of the chart is not 911 calls?,255,,
1304,0.97,12643.53,12648.035,"No, that is the Proactive call event count.",256,,
1305,0.97,12648.035,12654.141,So we don't have a 911 call count?,257,,
1306,0.97,12654.141,12656.543,"No, I know that it happens to be 222,900.",258,,
1307,0.97,12656.543,12659.847,I said it so that's why you're thinking about it.,259,,
1308,0.97,12659.847,12673.06,I'm also interested to know has it gone down or gone up for the period of time that you are reporting it?,260,,
1309,0.97,12673.06,12673.661,I will.,261,,
1310,0.97,12673.661,12678.932,"I should clarify the 2 22,000 that I'm talking about is just police calls.",261,,
1311,0.97,12678.932,12686.573,"The actual call center for medical and the rest of it are more like 700--700,000.",261,,
1312,0.97,12686.573,12689.276,Anyone else?,262,,
1313,0.97,12689.276,12692.279,No hands raised.,262,,
1314,0.97,12692.279,12700.688,And no notes in the chat.,262,,
1315,0.97,12700.688,12701.889,"And no texts, so let's go.",262,,
1316,0.97,12701.889,12703.357,I have 3 different places I'm looking.,262,,
1317,0.97,12703.357,12707.161,So now we are getting into a little bit more of the detail.,263,,
1318,0.97,12707.161,12720.107,What you see here is the overtime budget and I'm going to point out that over time as a whole--let me back up.,263,,
1319,0.97,12720.107,12720.974,$30 million.,263,,
1320,0.97,12720.974,12736.123,As you remember from the first slide that is a huge chunk of personnel expenses . When you take $30 million and add salaries and benefits you are at 82% of the entire budget of the Department.,263,,
1321,0.97,12736.123,12742.096,Obviously it is a big area that the budget office watches closely.,263,,
1322,0.97,12742.096,12755.509,"Just to give you a high level overview, when you are looking at over time you have about 88% of overtime sworn in 12% is civilian.",263,,
1323,0.97,12755.509,12759.947,These are estimates that the budget office came up with.,263,,
1324,0.97,12759.947,12765.252,It is difficult to get this data so they did the best they could to Triangulate.,263,,
1325,0.97,12765.252,12769.056,This is a sense they have about how this is broken down.,263,,
1326,0.97,12769.056,12798.352,"This is an overall picture on the left of how overtime is spent and I think as you move down and look at the various categories, what you can see is there are places where there is a lot of overtime spent and obviously what will jump right out at you is $6.8 million in sports at $3.3 million.",263,,
1327,0.97,12798.352,12814.801,"Emphasis patrols 2.2, not huge but these are areas where the Department spends a lot of money giving officers mostly overtime to provide security and emphasis.",263,,
1328,0.97,12814.801,12827.214,With sports I should note that is a category that is largely Reimbursable like the Seahawks or the Mariners.,263,,
1329,0.97,12827.214,12846.099,"When you get to events, $6.8 million, the city receives some money for events through the special event permitting office but it is nowhere near the cost that the city has 4 patrolling events.",263,,
1330,0.97,12846.099,12869.256,"Again it is a policy choice to use sworn officers for events, for traffic or security . It is absolutely within the Purview of the Department to do things differently if they chose to use more for events and fewer officers.",263,,
1331,0.97,12869.256,12872.926,I know that is something they are constantly taking a look at.,263,,
1332,0.97,12872.926,12905.859,"But again, showing you where a lot of the expenses are, most here in the top categories are fairly intuitive . The criminal investigations Bureau and $3.4 million they spend in overtime, what we are talking about is largely extra time with another 4 hours past to try to clear some cases and gets logged into that overtime.",263,,
1333,0.97,12905.859,12911.498,This is a pretty good breakout for each one of us.,263,,
1334,0.97,12911.498,12921.708,I do not have it here because the more detailed table is long but we do have it if you would like to see it.,263,,
1335,0.97,12921.708,12932.219,I don't remember the outcome of the question.,264,,
1336,0.97,12932.219,12957.444,"The director of the office of--culture has raised the issue of the costs associated with Flaggers at events and I remember he had raised that there had been a problem in basically, events from allowing private security to do the flagging.",264,,
1337,0.97,12957.444,12983.637,"So the cost associated with that, even though you say they are not fully compensated when there are community events that the city is partially subsidizing, costs the city money whether or not it is--a leader costs the city money or the event sponsor more money being that currently they have to be sworn officers.",264,,
1338,0.97,12983.637,12986.273,You mentioned they do not have to be sworn officers.,264,,
1339,0.97,12986.273,13001.521,What I had heard is not only do they--not only do they have to be sworn officers but they cannot actually go the Non-Spd route altogether and have private security.,264,,
1340,0.97,13001.521,13006.36,That is something I'm interested in finding out more about.,264,,
1341,0.97,13006.36,13007.394,Sure.,265,,
1342,0.97,13007.394,13023.01,What I can tell you is we did research a few years back and I have a memo saying there is no state law or SMC that requires officers to do Street closures or traffic control.,265,,
1343,0.97,13023.01,13045.399,"There would be bargaining issues if that body of work was given over entirely to another group of employees because there would be a potential skimming issue taking work away . But the Department uses where it can, Pei was, because they are cheaper from an overtime rate.",265,,
1344,0.97,13045.399,13054.141,Certainly the issues you are talking about are ones that we can explore.,265,,
1345,0.97,13054.141,13056.143,I think you may be muted.,265,,
1346,0.97,13056.143,13059.212,Thank you.,266,,
1347,0.97,13059.212,13078.799,What I would be most interested in exploring given what you have just nursed is whether or not there would be bargaining issues by the city changing its policy and not using other city employees to do the function.,267,,
1348,0.97,13078.799,13093.713,"But, allowing folks who are hosting community events to not use city employees at all to hire separately private security.",267,,
1349,0.97,13093.713,13095.248,We will look into that for you.,268,,
1350,0.97,13095.248,13101.054,Thank you.,269,,
1351,0.97,13101.054,13105.692,Thank you so much.,269,,
1352,0.97,13105.692,13113.8,"The comment that you made about it is Reimbursable, are we getting every dollar back from sports events?",270,,
1353,0.97,13113.8,13129.483,The city auditor did an audit a few years ago and identified how much of the costs of the city are reimbursed as it relates to the special event permitting process.,271,,
1354,0.97,13129.483,13149.202,"As mentioned, the police departments are some of those costs but there are others across all departments and there are different results in our success doing full cost recovery depending on what kind of event.",271,,
1355,0.97,13149.202,13156.71,"There is better cost recovery, generally speaking, for sports than there are for community events.",271,,
1356,0.97,13156.71,13171.758,The analysis that the city auditor did kind of it down according to different types of events where our goal is to have cost recovery.,271,,
1357,0.97,13171.758,13181.468,If it's okay I want to give Angela a chance to say a little bit about this and see if there's anything I may have Misspoken about.,272,,
1358,0.97,13181.468,13185.672,Again it has been a long time since I was deeply involved in overtime.,272,,
1359,0.97,13185.672,13187.641,"Please, Angela.",273,,
1360,0.97,13187.641,13192.679,I think you did a good job of capturing it.,274,,
1361,0.97,13192.679,13194.948,We know the city is subsidizing events specifically.,274,,
1362,0.97,13194.948,13220.707,I think sports . sporting events are governed by a separate set of rules and contracts and we are recovering more of those costs and do see a greater reimbursement percentage for those . that is all I have to really add on to the event piece but happy to answer the questions about the overtime budget.,274,,
1363,0.97,13220.707,13236.923,To close the Loop on events for sports I would like to know what percentage we are not getting back from sporting events and the total cost . that seems like it should be 100% reimbursed.,275,,
1364,0.97,13236.923,13255.008,"And the 2ND question that I had for central staff or the police Department is in our emphasis patrol line, to $.248 million.",275,,
1365,0.97,13255.008,13258.845,Is this a completely new item given the new emphasis patrols that the Mayor had before?,275,,
1366,0.97,13258.845,13275.328,"If it is not completely new, if we had done that in the past prior to the Mayor's announcement of emphasis the trolls how much has it increased over the last 2 or 3 years given the renewed policy of the Mayor to do emphasis patrols?",275,,
1367,0.97,13275.328,13277.564,Go ahead.,276,,
1368,0.97,13277.564,13284.271,We have seen an increase although we did not get a specific appropriation.,277,,
1369,0.97,13284.271,13290.277,We did redirect some of our budget to that line item.,277,,
1370,0.97,13290.277,13293.38,Existing budget to that line item.,277,,
1371,0.97,13293.38,13295.849,I should say we did--sorry.,277,,
1372,0.97,13295.849,13302.555,We did a specific appropriation in the 2020 budget process for emphasis patrols but prior to that we did not have anything specific.,277,,
1373,0.97,13302.555,13311.898,We were self budgeted around 1.4 million and this year has increased to about $2.2 million.,277,,
1374,0.97,13311.898,13330.383,That number can be fluid depending on the operational need for emphasis patrols but historically we have been able to operate within that budget more or less within the existing budget.,277,,
1375,0.97,13330.383,13332.819,So it almost double?,278,,
1376,0.97,13332.819,13338.925,"It went up about $800,000 in 2020 specifically.",279,,
1377,0.97,13338.925,13346.333,As far as sporting events go I can get back to you on the percentage of reimbursement.,279,,
1378,0.97,13346.333,13356.876,Just one more NOTE on that topic,279,,
1379,0.97,13361.881,13379.666,"Traffic needs and around the Stadium and when you have thousands of people Congregating to a specific location, that's going to have impact outside of what we would consider to be kind of that working area or that Stadium area.",280,,
1380,0.97,13379.666,13400.22,"And there's reluctance to pay for, say, traffic control services five blocks away, even though as a city we feel like we need to make sure that the flow of traffic through downtown on game day is--works for everyone.",280,,
1381,0.97,13400.22,13404.457,There is some disagreement on who should shoulder those costs.,280,,
1382,0.97,13405.925,13406.459,Thank you.,281,,
1383,0.97,13406.459,13412.398,"And before we move onto the next slide, I'm going to make sure there's nobody else in the Cue.",281,,
1384,0.97,13412.398,13416.002,"I want to also--Oh, Councilmember Strauss.",281,,
1385,0.97,13416.002,13419.305,"Yeah, thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",282,,
1386,0.97,13419.305,13425.044,I've had many questions and you have asked them so just not that I'm sitting here in silence.,282,,
1387,0.97,13425.044,13435.155,I oftentimes have gotten ready to ask a question and you have asked it so wanted to let the record reflect.,282,,
1388,0.97,13435.155,13435.488,Fantastic.,283,,
1389,0.97,13435.488,13435.789,Thank you.,283,,
1390,0.97,13435.789,13473.159,"Before we move on, want to note it's my recollection and, Greg, you can confirm whether or not I'm right, and don't hold back and tell me I'm wrong, that it is a pretty typical practice that even though we pass a budget with a very large number of dollars committed to overtime, it is pretty typical practice that we Revisit throughout the year to add more overtime to the police Department budget.",283,,
1391,0.97,13473.159,13497.283,"So given even that our budget is $30 million for overtime for the police Department, it would not be surprising if there was a request or a need to Backfill overtime dollars that they have already spent, basically.",283,,
1392,0.97,13497.283,13508.862,"Councilmember, I would answer your question by saying, you are absolutely right for the large history that you have been with the city.",284,,
1393,0.97,13508.862,13523.243,"Up until very recently, the SPD overtime budget was the budget that was provided to the Department, was inadequate to be able to cover the expenses and the activities that were required of the Department.",284,,
1394,0.97,13523.243,13548.434,"Within the last couple years they have turned that around a bit and I think Angela is probably one of the very few budget managers in the history of the Department that has, to my knowledge, not had to come to the city council with a supplemental request for more overtime.",284,,
1395,0.97,13548.434,13556.209,It's truly a different--it's a different world when it comes to overtime these days.,284,,
1396,0.97,13556.209,13558.811,"And, in fact, Covid is going to make it a very different world.",284,,
1397,0.97,13558.811,13568.187,"A lot of the overtime that you see here, obviously, around things like events, isn't being spend right now.",284,,
1398,0.97,13568.187,13570.924,Most of the summer events are just not going to happen.,284,,
1399,0.97,13570.924,13598.785,"And so I think what you're going to see next week when the executive transmits its Rebalanced budget so it could address the revenue shortfalls for Covid is likely some expenditure reductions in the overtime budget because SPD is not having to deliver as many services there, and the Council will have an opportunity to review that budget, of course, next week.",284,,
1400,0.97,13598.785,13601.321,Don't at all want to disagree with you.,284,,
1401,0.97,13601.321,13618.404,"You are 100% right about the Supplementals over many, many, many years, going back decades, actually, but within the last couple of years they have really turned it around.",284,,
1402,0.97,13618.404,13619.005,"Thank you, Angela.",285,,
1403,0.97,13619.005,13622.875,So I'm going to move onto this next one.,286,,
1404,0.97,13622.875,13653.639,"This is part of a request that you had made for this presentation and the Department has put forward the cost for demonstration equipment and basically what I did was I took that picture out of the paper, actually, I think it was Komo that had it and I asked the Department to give me everything that they are wearing and then I said, I think shields are also used, but they are not in the picture.",286,,
1405,0.97,13653.639,13700.92,"And so this is what the Department put together, and what you can see here line by line is each item that the officer is wearing and the Subtotal for the unit cost, adding the tax and then the 2020 cost, and I'm guessing the multipurpose gear, the uniforms down below, that's probably something that is used all the time, not necessarily distinct to presentations, but I am going to have Angela talk a little bit about how equipment--demonstration equipment is paid for on a regular basis.",286,,
1406,0.97,13700.92,13715.268,"I believe that new officers receive it and then have her speak to when those items wear out, how they are reimbursed, or paid for.",286,,
1407,0.97,13715.268,13719.872,"Thanks, Angela.",287,,
1408,0.97,13719.872,13720.173,Go ahead.,287,,
1409,0.97,13720.173,13720.44,Yeah.,288,,
1410,0.97,13720.44,13752.839,"So with all uniform or standard uniform equipment, including the demonstration equipment that you see listed here, the majority of that is issued by our quarter master, which is, for those of you who aren't familiar with the term, we have a warehouse, essentially, of equipment and things that are purchased centrally, one for efficiency sake but also just for tracking inventory and stock and asset, you know, the asset management piece.",288,,
1411,0.97,13752.839,13777.93,"So as you are on boarded as a sworn police Department employee, you are issued equipment, some of which is listed here, for demonstration purposes or when you are deployed to demonstrations or crowd management incidents.",288,,
1412,0.97,13777.93,13803.289,"In the course of your career at SPD, you know, some of these things may get more use than others, but over the course of your time with SPD, if that equipment wears out or needs to be replaced, we have a process whereby you submit a request authorization to receive replacement equipment.",288,,
1413,0.97,13803.289,13817.203,All of that is handled Centerly through the quarter master so when you see the purchase budgets later in this presentation there is a line specifically for that equipment warehouse.,288,,
1414,0.97,13817.203,13820.339,Pretty much everything goes through that unit.,288,,
1415,0.97,13820.339,13840.226,"I mean, from printer ink to pens and paper and, you know, Notepads, they are responsible for keeping a level of stock there, you know, if the--we also have--I believe it's a $500 uniform allowance.",288,,
1416,0.97,13840.226,13855.508,"Some items like the uniform pants and shirts here, anything on your duty belt, that's expected to be paid for out of your individual uniform allowance, which is built into the contract.",288,,
1417,0.97,13855.508,13866.619,I think as far as--let me see if I'm missing anything.,288,,
1418,0.97,13866.619,13872.358,"Councilmember Herbold, I try to suggest we get through the slides the rest of the hour and the need to get through the materials.",289,,
1419,0.97,13872.358,13872.758,That's great.,290,,
1420,0.97,13872.758,13886.939,"I do want to give Councilmember Morales an opportunity to ask her question on slide nine, that was the question that I had Cued up a while ago but did not sequence it correctly with the slide.",290,,
1421,0.97,13886.939,13889.175,Thank you.,291,,
1422,0.97,13889.175,13889.575,I appreciate it.,291,,
1423,0.97,13889.575,13895.448,So I am actually trying to look at slides nine and ten together.,291,,
1424,0.97,13895.448,13905.157,It seems that each officer goes out to demonstration in about $900 worth of protective gear.,291,,
1425,0.97,13905.157,13921.507,"Looks like based on the slide ten, we spend Maybe an average of $30,000 in crowd control and I know this isn't a huge portion of the budget but I do want to ensure that none of the crowd control inventory that we have used this year gets replaced.",291,,
1426,0.97,13921.507,13933.519,"That's a separate issue but I'm trying to understand how this category, particularly the crowd control is budgeted and how much we spend per demonstration.",291,,
1427,0.97,13933.519,13935.421,So I have a couple questions.,291,,
1428,0.97,13935.421,13952.238,"Is there a Placeholder in this budget for operating equipment, particularly crowd control equipment, since it seems like it is purchased as it's used, but there has to be a budget for it.",291,,
1429,0.97,13952.238,13956.142,"And then the next question, that is, where does the crowd control equipment come from?",291,,
1430,0.97,13956.142,13966.752,"Does that also come from the quarter masters warehouse and if so, where did the quarter master.",291,,
1431,0.97,13966.752,13967.019,Get it?,291,,
1432,0.97,13967.019,13968.154,,292,,
1433,0.97,13968.154,13990.042,"The big picture, just so we are all on the same page, this $67,000 is what is needed to equip the new folks that are coming into the Department, and then as equipment wears out, that's what comes from the quarter master line that Angela is talking about that we will get to in just a moment.",293,,
1434,0.97,13990.042,13992.011,And then I'll flip it to the next slide.,293,,
1435,0.97,13992.011,13995.081,"Did I say anything wrong there, Angela?",293,,
1436,0.97,13995.081,13995.581,"No, that's correct.",294,,
1437,0.97,13995.581,13997.984,All right.,295,,
1438,0.97,13997.984,14002.521,"So the next slide is Councilmember Morales, the one you were talking about.",295,,
1439,0.97,14002.521,14011.23,These are the costs that the Department incurs for buying the crowd control devices.,295,,
1440,0.97,14011.23,14026.779,"You can see here the amount that was spent in 2017, 2018 and 2019 and, of course, the bullet points show what was purchased.",295,,
1441,0.97,14026.779,14038.624,"The second but point talks about the White smoke grenades, the devices, I don't know what an R11 launcher is but I'm guessing maybe Councilmember Herbold or others do.",295,,
1442,0.97,14038.624,14046.465,"Blast balls, the noise sponge, munitions gas rounds.",295,,
1443,0.97,14046.465,14049.101,These items are replaced using operating funds as they expire.,295,,
1444,0.97,14049.101,14051.737,We are going so see a list of where those budgets are.,295,,
1445,0.97,14051.804,14061.447,"Hey are not Particularl large, as you can see this is not a particularly large number.",295,,
1446,0.97,14061.447,14086.172,"With regard to the question about the cost of the demonstrations, SPD provided me with some costs but it was a very low number and didn't capture the overtime that officers are Expending or that the Department is Expending on officers for the demonstrations and that's going to be the very largest part of the costs.",295,,
1447,0.97,14086.172,14104.49,"So I didn't put a number here yet because I think that's something that the Department still needs to determine when the payroll cycle ends, how much they have spent on overtime for these demonstrations and then provide that to the Council.",295,,
1448,0.97,14104.49,14108.461,See if there's anything I'm missing here.,295,,
1449,0.97,14108.461,14125.878,"Oh, of course, here's the last bullet says that based on an average that you can see in the table above, if the Department stopped buying that crowd control devices, they would save crowd control up and they would save $40,000 per year on average.",295,,
1450,0.97,14125.878,14126.278,Final point.,296,,
1451,0.97,14126.278,14129.215,Where does this equipment come from?,296,,
1452,0.97,14129.215,14135.654,I don't know where the Department BUYS it from.,297,,
1453,0.97,14135.654,14146.232,"Councilmember Morales, that is one of the submitted questions that we sent to the executive.",297,,
1454,0.97,14146.232,14147.299,Thank you.,298,,
1455,0.97,14147.299,14150.836,All right.,299,,
1456,0.97,14150.836,14165.217,"So now this particular table and the next several tables start to get into some fiscal detail, and so the amount of time that you want me to spend on these, I will follow your lead.",299,,
1457,0.97,14165.217,14169.355,"But at a very high level here, this is the inner fund billing.",299,,
1458,0.97,14169.355,14177.897,There was a question earlier about how much is spent for technology.,299,,
1459,0.97,14177.897,14180.466,The itd is the Seattle I.T.,299,,
1460,0.97,14180.466,14183.369,"Allocation, and it's $26 million.",299,,
1461,0.97,14183.369,14185.337,This is what Seattle I.T.,299,,
1462,0.97,14185.337,14189.975,Charges the police Department through the inner fund billing cycle to provide I.T.,299,,
1463,0.97,14189.975,14196.615,"Services, as you can see, it is one of the larger numbers here.",299,,
1464,0.97,14196.615,14208.994,"You can see the fleet's maintenance, the fleet's fuel, the fleet's replacement, all this comes to that $57 million number that we talked about earlier.",299,,
1465,0.97,14208.994,14216.669,I'm going to move along unless somebody Yells at me to stop.,299,,
1466,0.97,14216.669,14240.859,"Professional services, this is the budget that is used for various kinds of contracts that the Department has, the--probably the very biggest one that you can see at the top is for photo enforcement, the 3.3 million is the budget that the Department has for paying American traffic systems, which is the vendor for our cameras.",299,,
1467,0.97,14240.859,14248.801,"You can see along the line items that there's, for instance, an item for the mental health providers that are on the Crt teams.",299,,
1468,0.97,14248.801,14254.873,There's five of them now.,299,,
1469,0.97,14254.873,14256.108,"And that costs 44,700,000.",299,,
1470,0.97,14256.108,14259.511,They are contracted out with a community building organization.,299,,
1471,0.97,14259.511,14271.457,"As you move down this list you will see a variety of different kind of contracts that the Department has, including its vet services.",299,,
1472,0.97,14271.457,14278.931,"Again, it comes to not a lot of money overall.",299,,
1473,0.97,14278.931,14286.272,"About $6 million Subtotal and, actually, I'm not sure between the Subtotal and the adopted budget, what the difference is.",299,,
1474,0.97,14286.272,14293.779,"Oh, the Subtotal is the total of these particular items and there's probably a miscellaneous category, and maybe that's the 239.",299,,
1475,0.97,14293.779,14302.788,"Anything wrong I said there, Angela?",299,,
1476,0.97,14302.788,14314.4,"So the Delta there is--I mean, years of incremental budgeting essentially creates--it creates a budget that may or may not be attributable to specific items.",300,,
1477,0.97,14314.4,14327.613,"So in this case what we have done is called out the specific items that are known, that comprise--or went into the development of that--the adopted budget is $6 million.",300,,
1478,0.97,14327.613,14334.153,"We don't necessarily know--we can say clearly these are the--you know, this is the $5.8 million of that 6 million.",300,,
1479,0.97,14334.153,14338.524,These are the things that were budgeted specifically for that purpose.,300,,
1480,0.97,14338.524,14349.034,We have a number of other items that we--that hit against this to include the medical testing and Prehiring tests.,300,,
1481,0.97,14349.034,14355.607,There are some things that hit against this account that don't necessarily have a specific appropriation for.,300,,
1482,0.97,14355.607,14368.854,"It's just, you know, been past practice or historically expenses hit against this fund but we wanted to call out specifically the items that we could.",300,,
1483,0.97,14368.854,14372.825,The specific budget appropriations that we could that follows this account.,300,,
1484,0.97,14372.825,14374.827,"The bigger ones, Yeah.",301,,
1485,0.97,14374.827,14376.962,So I'm going to keep moving through.,302,,
1486,0.97,14376.962,14378.931,We got a lot of these.,302,,
1487,0.97,14378.931,14408.66,"Travel and training, this is a breakout by Bureau of the dollars that are spent on travel and training, and you have here everything from certification requirements that officers are required to fulfill, say, like Motorcycle certification for the Motorcycle traffic officers, all the way to conferences that civilians might attend.",302,,
1488,0.97,14408.66,14425.511,"This is just the breakout for a 2,000 person Departmnt of the travel and training money, about a million bucks, 1.1.",302,,
1489,0.97,14429.715,14432.751,Councilmember Herbold.,303,,
1490,0.97,14432.751,14433.585,Councilmember Mosqueda.,304,,
1491,0.97,14433.585,14448.834,As elected officials we have a requirement to report when someone pays for us to do travel or conferences and what I'm concerned with is that this budget might not reflect maybe portions of training that are being paid for by other entities.,305,,
1492,0.97,14448.834,14463.148,Is there any possibility that there are additional travel or training trips that are not reflected in what the city is paying for?,305,,
1493,0.97,14463.148,14465.384,That's an interesting question.,306,,
1494,0.97,14465.384,14471.857,My initial response is there might be a gift of public funds issue there.,306,,
1495,0.97,14471.857,14476.795,"I would doubt it but I'll Double-Check with the Finance manager, ask Angela.",306,,
1496,0.97,14476.795,14479.765,"Yeah, I can respond to that.",307,,
1497,0.97,14479.765,14496.281,"We do have some--some of our travel training is reimbursed by organize--if there's a Conferene that one of our employees is asked to present at, there are occasions where we do accept a reimbursement for that.",307,,
1498,0.97,14496.281,14505.424,"However, the Department has not historically requested an appropriation to accept that revenue to SPD.",307,,
1499,0.97,14505.424,14507.493,Typically that has just gone to the general fund.,307,,
1500,0.97,14507.493,14514.933,So any revenue we are bringing in for that purpose is going to the general Fund and not to SPD specifically.,307,,
1501,0.97,14514.933,14518.871,That would be a service that the Department was providing.,308,,
1502,0.97,14518.871,14528.413,It's not as though Taser is paying for a bunch of folks to go to a conference in Hawaii.,308,,
1503,0.97,14528.413,14528.78,That's correct.,308,,
1504,0.97,14528.78,14528.981,Yeah.,308,,
1505,0.97,14528.981,14531.216,There is some sort of exchange there.,308,,
1506,0.97,14531.216,14534.72,It is not free training being offered.,308,,
1507,0.97,14534.72,14540.926,"It's really in those cases where we are presenting or providing--you know, providing some sort of service.",308,,
1508,0.97,14540.926,14563.181,"And specifically to the concern that's been raised about Seattle police Department using our officers or sending our officers to places like Israel to receive training on police techniques, if it's not reflected in the 2020 allocation, where would we see that kind of line item?",309,,
1509,0.97,14563.181,14568.153,"If there's an expense along those lines, you know, it would hit against our budget here.",310,,
1510,0.97,14568.153,14579.598,"This is a representation of the budget appropriations, not necessarily specific expenditures within each of those groupings.",310,,
1511,0.97,14579.598,14584.603,That's certainly something that would show up on an expense report.,310,,
1512,0.97,14584.603,14602.054,"But I think the larger point, though, is that if there was a trip to Israel that was paid for, it would need to come out of that $1.08 million budget unless the department had some savings elsewhere where they could pay for it.",311,,
1513,0.97,14602.054,14611.53,This is traditionally and normally where they would pay for it and this is the budget that would pay for it.,311,,
1514,0.97,14611.53,14613.231,That's correct.,312,,
1515,0.97,14613.231,14613.432,Yeah.,312,,
1516,0.97,14613.432,14638.357,"So this next slide is a purchase slide and what you're looking at here is by Bureau, how much money is allocated for each section, and I guess what I would point out is that it is--well, $5 million seems like a lot, and it is a lot.",313,,
1517,0.97,14638.357,14641.393,I'm not going to draw judgment on the 5 million.,313,,
1518,0.97,14641.393,14668.387,"When you get down to the detail level, you will see that, for instance, here West precinct has $57,000 of discretionary purchase authority and as we were looking earlier at the slide for the sworn, they have, you know, just under a couple hundred people in that area, in that section.",313,,
1519,0.97,14668.387,14700.986,"So these are large dollar amounts, but for a department with 2,000 people, they are not necessarily--well, the Department is--does the best it C█An, at least my history, t try and make sure that it is managing the discretionary purchases appropriately and efficiently and effectively, I would say.",313,,
1520,0.97,14700.986,14704.589,"Chair Mosqueda or chair Herbold, whoever is operating here.",314,,
1521,0.97,14704.589,14705.757,I've had a couple of questions.,314,,
1522,0.97,14705.757,14708.026,I know it's hard to see my hand being raised.,314,,
1523,0.97,14708.026,14710.762,I've had a couple of questions over the course of this presentation.,314,,
1524,0.97,14710.762,14712.998,This is a great presentation.,314,,
1525,0.97,14712.998,14731.116,"Some of my questions do have to deal with the policies rather than the dollars and I'm wondering if we can have another committee meeting where we can go deep into these details again and I can also follow up with Greg, Angela and Kara off-line as well.",314,,
1526,0.97,14731.116,14739.624,"But I've got a couple of pages of questions, some of them have been answered by--or asked by Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Mosqueda.",314,,
1527,0.97,14739.624,14745.13,Wanted to flag that a request to have another meeting on these items.,314,,
1528,0.97,14745.13,14750.102,"Councilmember Strauss, thank you so much for bringing that up and I'm sorry if you haven't had the chance to ask questions.",315,,
1529,0.97,14750.102,14768.854,Would love to make sure you get those in before the presentation is over but as it relates to policy when we wrap up with this presentation I will provide an outline of the next steps as to relates to the inquest into Seattle police Department's budget and policy practices.,315,,
1530,0.97,14768.854,14769.187,Excellent.,316,,
1531,0.97,14769.187,14769.421,Thank you.,316,,
1532,0.97,14770.489,14771.056,Okay.,317,,
1533,0.97,14771.056,14776.328,"So these next two items, I am not going to--next two slides I'm not going to spend a lot on.",317,,
1534,0.97,14776.328,14795.981,"These are your budget adds for the 2020 budget and I just put these slides in so that as you look back at this presentation, if you had any curiosity about what got added or taken away from the budget, these are represented in slides 15 and 16.",317,,
1535,0.97,14795.981,14799.584,"And so, for instance, I'll go back to 15 here.",317,,
1536,0.97,14799.584,14806.691,You can see the expansion of the community service officer program.,317,,
1537,0.97,14806.691,14814.699,"There was $1.2 million added in--you've got the civilian investigator in OPA for 148,000.",317,,
1538,0.97,14814.699,14816.067,You're familiar with these adds.,317,,
1539,0.97,14816.067,14823.542,Most of you who were here during the last session had some involvement in them.,317,,
1540,0.97,14823.542,14828.246,So I won't summarize it unless you have any questions on 15 and 16.,317,,
1541,0.97,14828.246,14850.735,"I just want to know, it was my recollection that the item--the recruitment and retention item, that whereas there was an add in the Mayor's proposed budget for that item, I believe the Council action reduced that.",318,,
1542,0.97,14850.735,14865.617,"So this looks like a $1.28 million add, and my recollection is there was a line item for recruitment and retention and we actually reduced the amount for that item.",318,,
1543,0.97,14865.617,14868.653,"That is correct, Councilmember Herbold.",319,,
1544,0.97,14868.653,14882.934,"It was about 1.6 million, and the Council took a detailed look at the recruitment and retention initiative and took several hundred thousand or a few hundred thousand out of that and reduced it to 1.28 million.",319,,
1545,0.97,14882.934,14891.843,"Some of the changes that were made had to do with the--how folks pay for tests, for instance.",319,,
1546,0.97,14891.843,14894.112,That was one of the changes.,319,,
1547,0.97,14894.112,14903.822,The executive had assumed that the testing fee would be paid by the Department and the Council asked the executive to develop a sliding scale.,319,,
1548,0.97,14903.822,14911.196,"Those who could afford to pay the fee would, those who wouldn't, wouldn't, and found some efficiency and made a cut there.",319,,
1549,0.97,14911.196,14919.738,There was an effort to spread out the Sergeant training over two years.,319,,
1550,0.97,14919.738,14924.743,These changes resulted in a reduction to that initiative from the 1.6 to the 1.28.,319,,
1551,0.97,14924.743,14930.448,"And so, Councilmember Lewis, I see you have a question.",320,,
1552,0.97,14930.448,14949.0,"So the 7.2 million in the adopted budget as an addition is not--it's not--these aren't Council adds, these are the adds over the 2019 budget, some of them may be Council adds but it's not $7.2 million in counsel adds?",320,,
1553,0.97,14949.0,14949.334,Correct.,321,,
1554,0.97,14949.334,14961.88,"When I said you were familiar, I just mean these were discussed in-depth in the Council budget session.",321,,
1555,0.97,14961.88,14962.18,Perfect.,322,,
1556,0.97,14962.18,14963.048,By all of you.,323,,
1557,0.97,14963.048,14963.415,Sorry.,324,,
1558,0.97,14963.415,14964.149,Thank you so much.,325,,
1559,0.97,14964.149,14976.428,And I don't know if this goes into the future policy hearing that Councilmember Strauss has requested or if it would be relevant to this but I think I'll ask it now.,325,,
1560,0.97,14976.428,15010.562,"In looking at the community service officer add of the 6Ftes, do we know if that rate of like the 1.21 million for six positions of community service officers, would that be the Scalable going rate or is there a diminishing cost as--if we were to add more people into that program, or is that what it would be--about what it would be to hire six additional Ftes to go forward in groups of six?",325,,
1561,0.97,15010.562,15019.237,I think that number is a loaded number and may also be phased depending on when the Department thought they would hire them.,326,,
1562,0.97,15019.237,15021.239,"What do you mean by a loaded number, Greg?",327,,
1563,0.97,15021.239,15039.391,"I mean that it probably includes some initial equipment and it probably phases the--well, let me just start over, Angela.",328,,
1564,0.97,15039.391,15039.958,You're exactly right.,329,,
1565,0.97,15039.958,15042.894,What you're seeing there is going to be the setup costs.,329,,
1566,0.97,15042.894,15058.209,"So for any new employee, we load into the budget one-time costs for computers and a desk chair and some--all of the things that are needed to get somebody up and running.",329,,
1567,0.97,15058.209,15064.816,In future years the budget is adjusted Accordingly as that is a one-time appropriation.,329,,
1568,0.97,15064.816,15068.319,So that 1.2 million is going to be on the high end.,329,,
1569,0.97,15068.319,15079.798,"It would be a pretty good number if you're wanting to, say, estimate adding Csos, additional Csos in 2021.",329,,
1570,0.97,15079.798,15080.465,But if--Yeah.,329,,
1571,0.97,15080.465,15082.734,I just recommend reaching out to us.,329,,
1572,0.97,15082.734,15091.876,We would be happy to model some of that out or cost some of that out if you are interested in actually knowing what the one-time and ongoing costs would be.,329,,
1573,0.97,15091.876,15094.379,That would be easy for us to Údo.,329,,
1574,0.97,15094.379,15095.713,"I really appreciate it, Angela.",330,,
1575,0.97,15095.713,15103.455,"So just for the purposes of this conversation, that number is probably a little higher than what it would be if there was a significant Scaling of that program?",330,,
1576,0.97,15103.455,15105.223,Is that an accurate way to phrase it?,330,,
1577,0.97,15105.223,15106.891,Yes.,331,,
1578,0.97,15106.891,15111.296,Thank you so much.,332,,
1579,0.97,15111.296,15133.418,"So now the last few slides are the fiscal detail and what you're looking at here, there's going to be three slides, is a breakout of the unit, so here you've got--let's just grab patrol operations here.",333,,
1580,0.97,15133.418,15157.408,"You've got patrol operations and within patrol operations you have all the various units and you have how much is spent in those units and how much--how many Ftes are in those units and so as you go Scroll through this, you're going to find every unit in SPD and how much they spend and how many people there are.",333,,
1581,0.97,15157.408,15163.982,"So if you were to grab a specific line item, let's say S.W.A.T.",333,,
1582,0.97,15163.982,15165.984,"Here, the S.W.A.T.",333,,
1583,0.97,15165.984,15172.857,Team spends about $5.5 million a year and they have 29 FTE.,333,,
1584,0.97,15172.857,15195.146,"So when you look at the adopted budget and you look at that $5.5 million, as we have discussed, the majority of that is going to be a large piece of that is going to be personnel and, of course, as you see the 29 folks that are involved with that, that's going to be a large piece of the budget.",333,,
1585,0.97,15195.146,15209.227,"So as you go through each one of these, you can see the number of people and you can see the dollars and that gives you an idea of how much is spent per section and adds to the total appropriation at the end.",333,,
1586,0.97,15209.227,15245.296,"And, again, these tables are all designed to give you detail that goes all the way back to that first slide which I'm going to quickly Scroll back to here, where you had all the various categories, professional services we have gone through, travel and training, discretionary budget, you can find all of that stuff in all of these tables and then the last tables are just, as I said, sort of a Catchall for unit by unit, how much they spend.",333,,
1587,0.97,15245.296,15246.631,And that's it.,333,,
1588,0.97,15246.631,15247.799,Thank you.,334,,
1589,0.97,15247.799,15254.739,"That was really an incredible, useful presentation as an off point.",334,,
1590,0.97,15254.739,15257.375,"Councilmember Pedersen, yes.",334,,
1591,0.97,15257.375,15258.042,Thank you.,335,,
1592,0.97,15258.042,15262.046,"Yeah, thank you, everybody, for putting this presentation together.",335,,
1593,0.97,15262.046,15269.42,It's super important to have these breakdowns of the Seattle police Department's budget.,335,,
1594,0.97,15269.42,15279.631,"And wanted to zero in on this slide 18, which has a $13 million total for homeland security.",335,,
1595,0.97,15279.631,15286.971,Can you break that out in any more detail or provide any information on the 13 million for homeland security?,335,,
1596,0.97,15286.971,15291.442,I'll second that request.,336,,
1597,0.97,15291.442,15294.779,And here's what I'm getting at.,337,,
1598,0.97,15294.779,15335.353,"So I want to Demilitarize the Seattle police Department, and this is very helpful because it's starting to break out what that actually might mean, and there are some line items that pop out as being more Militaristic and the dollar figures aren't as high as in some of those line items, and so I want to Peel back another layer to see where we might be able to find some ceilings there.",337,,
1599,0.97,15335.353,15343.661,So the homeland security number popped out because it was a larger number and had a title that seemed suspect.,337,,
1600,0.97,15343.661,15375.993,"And I think, given there's 13 employees there and the dollar total, that tells you that there's something going on there that's--you know, given the ratio that we talked about of 75% personnel costs and 85% when you throw in overtime, probably something else going on there, and that's a situation where if Councilmembers have individual questions about these line items, I would encourage you to pass them on to us and we will get you information.",338,,
1601,0.97,15375.993,15389.907,"Yeah, you compare that line item 13000000 to 13 people to the one right below it on parking enforcement, about 13 million people, one--about $13 million and 120 people.",339,,
1602,0.97,15389.907,15407.859,"Councilmember Herbold, line item just above harbor patrol which is a Nonmilitary use of our force 30 people for $5 million, which is, you know, nearly--the homeland security total is nearly triple for half the staff.",340,,
1603,0.97,15407.859,15413.231,"Angela, do you write off no--should we get information later on homeland security?",341,,
1604,0.97,15413.231,15414.165,Would that be best?,341,,
1605,0.97,15414.165,15427.245,"I can actually probably address it right now, if we have time for that.",342,,
1606,0.97,15427.245,15434.819,"So the special operation center, Soc, is embedded in that particular project.",342,,
1607,0.97,15434.819,15448.733,They are responsible for coordinating all of our Large- scale events and so I would like to be able to confirm that for you and I can break that out into--that budget out into the specific accounts.,342,,
1608,0.97,15448.733,15458.543,"My suspicion is that that is the event overtime, so 10.4 million is--sorry, I'm looking now.",342,,
1609,0.97,15458.543,15478.763,"10.4Million of that 13 million is for event overtime, either--you saw that broken out in the overtime allocations on--I don't recall what slide, but that is not necessarily for personnel or--it's specifically for that event overtime.",342,,
1610,0.97,15478.763,15483.134,That makes sense.,343,,
1611,0.97,15483.134,15483.401,Yeah.,344,,
1612,0.97,15483.401,15485.336,I'm sorry.,345,,
1613,0.97,15485.336,15489.307,That isn't clear to me.,345,,
1614,0.97,15489.307,15493.11,What event overtime is homeland security responsible for?,345,,
1615,0.97,15493.11,15495.813,I'm losing the thread here.,345,,
1616,0.97,15495.813,15496.08,Yeah.,346,,
1617,0.97,15496.08,15501.986,"So, Greg, do you mind jumping to that overtime slide?",346,,
1618,0.97,15501.986,15507.391,And this is something that you could get back to us on.,347,,
1619,0.97,15507.391,15509.06,Yes.,348,,
1620,0.97,15509.06,15536.153,"So if you look at the events, I think it's ten events, events Seattle center, sports, unusual occurrences, if you add it up, all of that budget there, give or take a few dollars it's going to be about, you know, 10 million, which is what you're seeing--all of the budget for that is actually loaded into the homeland security project.",348,,
1621,0.97,15536.153,15539.19,I've got some additional questions but --,349,,
1622,0.97,15539.19,15539.857,Mr. Strauss.,350,,
1623,0.97,15539.857,15541.826,Thank you.,351,,
1624,0.97,15541.826,15547.865,I will wait for Councilmember Mosqueda to outline her next steps.,351,,
1625,0.97,15547.865,15548.032,No?,351,,
1626,0.97,15548.032,15548.733,Please go ahead.,352,,
1627,0.97,15548.733,15567.585,"Oh, I mean, I just have a number of different Policy- related questions as to how we engage with the Department of homeland security, how we are information sharing, what grants we are accepting, what--if we have--why events would be housed under Department of homeland security.",353,,
1628,0.97,15567.585,15577.161,I just need quite a bit more information on this topic.,353,,
1629,0.97,15577.161,15577.662,"Herbold, yes.",354,,
1630,0.97,15577.662,15588.172,It may be--I can work with the chair and--both chairs of the budget chair and Councilmember Herbold to see how best to get that information to you.,355,,
1631,0.97,15588.172,15602.219,"If you have specific questions about one particular area, it might be that the best way to handle that would be to have a briefing from the Department.",355,,
1632,0.97,15602.219,15608.392,We will figure out a way to make sure that all your questions get answered.,355,,
1633,0.97,15608.392,15609.193,"Thank you, Greg.",356,,
1634,0.97,15609.193,15612.396,"Chair Mosqueda, you want to take it away now, bring us home?",356,,
1635,0.97,15612.396,15612.663,Sure.,357,,
1636,0.97,15612.663,15620.171,I just want to make sure there's no other questions from Council colleagues.,357,,
1637,0.97,15620.171,15620.371,Okay.,357,,
1638,0.97,15620.371,15628.813,"Hearing none, thank you Councilmember Herbold for coordinating to have that presentation and thank you very much, Kara, and Angela and Greg.",357,,
1639,0.97,15628.813,15632.149,"Greg, thank you for putting together this presentation.",357,,
1640,0.97,15632.149,15651.902,"I think that within these slides it's going to be important for us to pull out the information that we need to be able to answer the questions we have been receiving related to how much are we spending on tanks or armored vehicles in our streets, how much are we spending related to this homeland security question and partnership with the Feds from that regard.",357,,
1641,0.97,15651.902,15671.088,"I have a lot of questions that perhaps don't fall directly within SPD's budget as 2020 was allocated but are specific to the response from the last two weeks, how much have we spent arresting people and Jailing people over the last two weeks as we waited for them to either make bail or have their hearing.",357,,
1642,0.97,15671.088,15674.358,So those are the types of questions I think within these slides.,357,,
1643,0.97,15674.358,15692.676,"Now that we have this base line, we can have a better understanding of where the next questions can be directed so, colleagues, I appreciate that, Councilmember Herbold, as always your detailed Orientedness got us to this level which I think is important and I want to thank you for that as well.",357,,
1644,0.97,15692.676,15693.911,Thank you.,358,,
1645,0.97,15693.911,15702.086,But really the majority of the thanks does need to go to central staffer Greg Doss and the team he's pulled together from the executive to get us here.,358,,
1646,0.97,15702.086,15704.689,So thanks for the thanks but I'm going to pass it on.,358,,
1647,0.97,15704.689,15707.158,Passing on the thanks.,359,,
1648,0.97,15707.158,15717.701,"Again, echoing our appreciation, we know you have been busy as well responding to everything that's happened over the last two weeks, so thank you for pulling this together, really do appreciate it.",359,,
1649,0.97,15717.701,15718.035,"Thanks, Greg.",359,,
1650,0.97,15718.035,15719.97,Thank you.,360,,
1651,0.97,15719.97,15720.838,And your team.,361,,
1652,0.97,15720.838,15731.916,"Colleagues, in terms of next steps, we will be sharing with you sort of a matrix for us to continue this Inquisition into the Seattle police Department's budget.",361,,
1653,0.97,15731.916,15745.329,"Next Wednesday we hope to have a category on our agenda called understanding other cities' expenses so we can better understand the budgets of other cities, highlight and hear from cities that have moved or are moving to more community based policing strategies.",361,,
1654,0.97,15745.329,15762.847,"On the 24th we hope to have an item on our agenda that talks about understanding Seattle's position on crime, policing inequity, developing an understanding of the historical context and understanding Seattle's crime and crime response numbers, some of that has been identified today.",361,,
1655,0.97,15762.847,15782.9,"And then on July 1ST building community safety proposal, having an opportunity for us to hear from the community conversation that's ongoing right now about where we would like to see our city budget priorities go for SPD recognizing that this Short- term conversation must filter into a longer-term conversation.",361,,
1656,0.97,15782.9,15785.369,These questions and summary conversations will be done through the budgeting lens.,361,,
1657,0.97,15785.369,15798.215,"This is the select budget committee, so we do ask people to think about the real question in front of us as it relates to funding, reducing funding, Defunding areas, where would you like to see items allocated to?",361,,
1658,0.97,15798.215,15812.73,We will be hearing from Community partners about some specific recommendations and we will be working with chair Herbold as chair of public safety on the Policy-Related questions so that our budget can direct those policy changes that we may want to see.,361,,
1659,0.97,15812.73,15829.513,"This is, I think, the beginning of a process that will lead to more conversations and more directive in the budget for '21, '22 which we will have soon in September.",361,,
1660,0.97,15829.513,15839.523,Four to six weeks as us Teeing up for possible strategies for investment and Deinvestment so we can make longer-term investments in the 21/22 budget.,361,,
1661,0.97,15839.523,15842.726,I think that sounds fantastic.,362,,
1662,0.97,15842.726,15852.937,"I would like to have another conversation, perhaps off-line unless our budget gurus have an immediate response to it.",362,,
1663,0.97,15852.937,15880.231,"But I'm very interested to know what it would mean to do budgeting from a Zero-Based budgeting perspective and if that is something that you have an understanding of how we would go about doing that, basically going through each line item and looking at what the needs are, looking at what the values of the city are for that need, assuming that we are starting from zero.",362,,
1664,0.97,15880.231,15883.667,That's a great addition.,363,,
1665,0.97,15883.667,15884.535,Thank you so much.,363,,
1666,0.97,15884.535,15898.148,"And then Council colleagues, the other thing I would mention is these additional questions you may have, we definitely want to capture those for central staff, and I think the sooner that you can send those over, the better.",363,,
1667,0.97,15898.148,15907.591,"But this type of information has been revealing, provided us a new level of detail that we haven't seen before.",363,,
