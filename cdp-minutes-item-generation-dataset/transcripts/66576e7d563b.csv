61,0.97,414.48,429.395,We all have uncertainty about how best to respond and what we're trying to do now is we're trying to limit that uncertainty to ensure that people do not take actions that might not only might not help us but could harm us.,13,,
62,0.97,429.395,443.709,"As we've all heard, the best precautions from public health officials is to stay at home when you're sick, Corps your Coughs cover your Coughs and Sneezes with an elbow tissue.",13,,

78,0.97,541.374,543.409,"Or if we're sick, we can stay home.",13,,
79,0.97,543.409,548.414,Care for a family member or get in to see a doctor the same day we have symptoms that concern us.,13,,
80,0.97,548.414,551.117,"And, that's not the case for everyone.",13,,
81,0.97,551.117,561.127,"And, that's another area that I know Council members are interested in hearing from our panel Presenters about how to address those issues.",13,,
82,0.97,561.127,571.938,"Our first responders, fire, police, nurses, doctors, care Givers, public health care workers, they don't get to call in sick.",13,,
83,0.97,571.938,579.946,"The teachers and staff and custodians who are asked to stay behind and sanitize the schools during the exercise, they don't get to stay home.",13,,
84,0.97,579.946,585.318,And the folks who provide us service that is we rely on perhaps even more so at times like these.,13,,
85,0.97,585.318,596.462,"Those who hand us the hand Sanitizer, who deliver our groceries or Online orders, or drive buses, carry our mail, who prepare our food.",13,,
86,0.97,596.462,602.368,It's their job and they do it because no one else can and they risk their health and safety to keep us safe too.,13,,
87,0.97,602.368,611.243,And I want to recognize and thank them for that and I want this conversation to have the needs of those people as a focus as well.,13,,
88,0.97,611.243,613.879,We must take this health crisis seriously.,13,,
89,0.97,613.879,621.053,We're going to hear from folks who are on the front line about the actions that they are taking.,13,,
90,0.97,621.053,625.057,"And, there are several steps that have already been taken.",13,,
91,0.97,625.057,641.807,"As I mentioned earlier, there has been the decision not only on the part of the city of Seattle and King County government to encourage Telecommuting, but many of our largest employers are also telling their workers to work from home.",13,,
92,0.97,641.807,654.92,The Mayor has issued a proclamation of civil emergency as Council President pro Temp Mosqueda Referenced earlier.,13,,

94,0.97,665.598,679.445,I want to thank the office of immigrant and refuge affairs for translating Coronavirus information into multiple languages and the public can find that information on Welcoming.Seattle.Gov.,13,,
95,0.97,679.445,686.419,The County has also started to set up quarantine sites.,13,,
96,0.97,686.419,689.121,This is critically important.,13,,

98,0.97,695.628,707.039,The Mayor is also announcing I believe either has announced or will be announcing later today the location of some additional tiny village sites as well.,13,,
99,0.97,707.039,719.351,We've been told that the city's navigation team is distributing hygiene kits and sharing information on Covid-19 with people who are living unsheltered and we look forward to hearing more about that.,13,,

102,0.97,746.412,752.118,So for those who have health insurance caution not keep people from testing.,13,,
103,0.97,752.118,765.064,"There is the reality that we're faced that testing, it has to be directed by a doctor and there are people in our community who do not have access to doctors, who don't have access to any insurance.",13,,
104,0.97,765.064,774.44,The University of Washington announced they now have permission and ability to test for Coronavirus and the region could possibly test up to a thousand samples a day.,13,,
105,0.97,774.44,777.91,This is a significant expansion in our testing capacity.,13,,
106,0.97,777.91,791.056,And public health officials throughout the county have been very consistent on keeping the public up to date and sharing information on how we can remain healthy and they're giving daily media updates to the public.,13,,
107,0.97,791.056,795.427,Their Website has a helpful fact sheet and answers to frequently asked questions.,13,,
108,0.97,795.427,808.741,I thank them because I think one of the most important things we can do for the public is about providing that consistent and frequent message that we're all rowing in the same direction and speaking the same language.,13,,

133,0.97,940.105,976.041,It's important to just remind everyone that our--this is not our first experience with pandemic response and we're building off our previous experiences and lessons learned from H1N1 in 2008 and 2009 and the existence of the work that the office of emergency management carries out on its regular mission and purpose allows us to be able to respond nimbly and flexibly while updating our continuity of operations planning to be able to work and respond quickly and effectively to the current situation.,24,,

151,0.97,1065.03,1072.204,Just from a public health perspective I think one of the things we do in the public health and we do well is what we call surveillance.,32,,
152,0.97,1072.204,1078.444,And surveillance is really about our data collection and able to tell when we have something going on within our community.,32,,
153,0.97,1078.444,1080.746,We rely on that data for a variety of sources.,32,,
154,0.97,1080.746,1082.848,The public health LABS.,32,,
155,0.97,1082.848,1088.854,Larger commercial LABS through doctors in medical community reporting.,32,,
156,0.97,1088.854,1096.061,They're mandated to do reports and in surveillance in real time enables us to do that where we're at.,32,,
157,0.97,1096.061,1102.701,I've been in public health for 27 years with what we are doing and responding to at this point.,32,,
158,0.97,1102.701,1112.744,"I will also just in the context of reminding people because I think um, it's important to remind people that this is a novel Coronavirus.",32,,
159,0.97,1112.744,1118.851,Novel in the sense that we are learning every day a little bit more about this virus and transmission.,32,,
160,0.97,1118.851,1129.261,So what I'm presenting today is really to ground you in what we know today and what is our best thinking today and our best strategies based on a variety of things.,32,,
161,0.97,1129.261,1143.876,"And, so, we'll see where it goes and we'll continue to update you and we appreciate you being Embassadors in this process with us because in order to be where we need in the community it's going to take all of us as a Clef.",32,,
162,0.97,1143.876,1146.678,So I appreciate the colleagues around the table doing that.,32,,
163,0.97,1146.678,1148.847,Sorry that Patty couldn't be here today.,32,,
164,0.97,1148.847,1154.286,We are pulled in a thousand different directions so I'll try to give you my best from on the ground.,32,,
165,0.97,1154.286,1171.703,We've been in activation as it was said since January when we first heard of the virus breaking in China and really thinking and watching what that was going to be doing and how it was going to preparing for if it should or when it would hit the shores here within our own country.,32,,
166,0.97,1171.703,1184.449,"We've been the first on a couple things in the state of Washington to have the first confirmed case and, now, unfortunately, have the first deaths that are occurring from this virus.",32,,
167,0.97,1184.449,1187.419,The--our heart goes out.,32,,
168,0.97,1187.419,1192.558,When we talk about numbers we're talking about people and we're talking about families.,32,,
169,0.97,1192.558,1204.57,"And, so, everybody's impacted about this in a different way and we often get into our space and we think broad populations so just not to lose track that these are people and people that we care about in our communities.",32,,
170,0.97,1204.57,1212.244,"Um, it's important I think for what I can share for an update, I think it was already--just to Reemphasize that.",32,,
171,0.97,1212.244,1216.481,"Currently, in the state of Washington we have 70 confirmed cases and 11 deaths.",32,,
172,0.97,1216.481,1224.79,"Here in King County, we have 51 of those cases and 10 deaths.",32,,
173,0.97,1224.79,1245.11,"The epicenter hit in one of our most vulnerable places in our community is in long term care facilities and, unfortunately, has taken the life of many family members from that community within that life care center over in Kirkland.",32,,
174,0.97,1245.11,1246.111,It's tragic.,32,,
175,0.97,1246.111,1247.412,It's unfortunate.,32,,
176,0.97,1247.412,1254.419,"We see these numbers of these 10 deaths in King County, all of them are related to this health care facility other than one.",32,,
177,0.97,1254.419,1259.524,So the epicenter is pretty focused and quickly spreading.,32,,
178,0.97,1259.524,1264.896,"And, so, we just wanted to keep that in context in numbers as a bit of a reality.",32,,
179,0.97,1264.896,1281.913,"I know most of you know because you're following the media and following public health and our Website, but it's also every time we get an opportunity is that 80% of the people who will come in contact with this virus are going to receive it in a moderate to mild thing.",32,,
180,0.97,1281.913,1284.75,Just like a typical regular flu.,32,,
181,0.97,1284.75,1293.659,"It's the 20% that have underlying health conditions, over 60 years old that are the most impacted from this virus.",32,,
182,0.97,1293.659,1300.966,"So, in public health in any Reportable condition, our goal is to do what we call contact racing.",32,,
183,0.97,1300.966,1303.869,In our surveillance system we get reports of cases.,32,,
184,0.97,1303.869,1305.07,"We, then, follow up.",32,,
185,0.97,1305.07,1307.105,We do an interview with those people.,32,,
186,0.97,1307.105,1309.775,We then figure out where they've been.,32,,
187,0.97,1309.775,1319.651,"If there's businesses, schools, other things we need to notify we do that and as well we try to follow up with every contact to be able to shut the disease down as quickly as we can.",32,,
188,0.97,1319.651,1324.79,"As this disease grows, our strategy is going to have to change.",32,,
189,0.97,1324.79,1329.094,"And um, we talk about it in public health in two fields.",32,,
190,0.97,1329.094,1331.797,We talk about it in containment and mitigation.,32,,
191,0.97,1331.797,1339.905,So the containment of the virus is about how do we stop the spread and contain it as best we can so there isn't a wide community spread.,32,,
192,0.97,1339.905,1347.112,In the area of mitigation is once it's out of the box is then how do we mitigate it as best we can.,32,,
193,0.97,1347.112,1368.133,From our Modelling and where we're looking at we decided very quickly knowing what happened in Wuhan and other parts of the world is that our mitigation strategies were going to have to come fast and hard and we have implemented those and we're implementing as we go.,32,,
194,0.97,1368.133,1377.909,"The people that we serve is we usually want to take time through community engagement, have people weigh in on what these communication strategies are.",32,,
195,0.97,1377.909,1380.445,We're doing our best with the information we have.,32,,
196,0.97,1380.445,1383.148,We have Eth Sis sitting with us.,32,,
197,0.97,1383.148,1390.655,Really helping to make these decisions as best we can without doing a full as a public health in a government agency.,32,,
198,0.97,1390.655,1392.858,So we're going to get it wrong sometimes.,32,,
199,0.97,1392.858,1399.264,We're going to step on toes and I'm sure we're going to Overstep sometimes.,32,,
200,0.97,1399.264,1407.305,But we just really ask that you join us and be a partner with us and help us and if we have a blind spot bring it to our attention.,32,,
201,0.97,1407.305,1412.077,We're moving as quickly as we can to mitigate the strategies of this work.,32,,
202,0.97,1412.077,1428.36,"And, let me just kind of bucket those two things in containment and mitigation . in the mitigation--in the containment strategy right now, we are getting our lab results, we're trying to follow up with everybody who's reported.",32,,
203,0.97,1428.36,1432.664,The state lab has only been operational in our state since last Friday.,32,,
204,0.97,1432.664,1435.801,"So, we're not even a week into this.",32,,
205,0.97,1435.801,1446.511,"And, so, we're trying to build these systems in real time in order to be able to do it and the numbers are coming in rather rapidly in incomplete information.",32,,
206,0.97,1446.511,1456.321,We've done a really strong and hard reach and look into the long term care facility and the best we can do within that environment and the health care workers.,32,,
207,0.97,1456.321,1464.329,The people on the front line not only are the public health folks who are working around the clock to do what they do.,32,,
208,0.97,1464.329,1477.042,"I will tell you when this broke over the weekend, we had a staff of probably 35, 40 that were in the office and I had 100 people that went to sign and asked what they can do.",32,,
209,0.97,1477.042,1479.611,People are showing up and doing their jobs.,32,,
210,0.97,1479.611,1483.615,So you should be proud of your public health system.,32,,
211,0.97,1483.615,1489.754,Around the containment strategy with the life care center and all of the health care facilities that have been transported out.,32,,
212,0.97,1489.754,1501.533,"As people, as residents are not able to be cared for any longer in that facility because of their worsening conditions, they are moved out into the hospitals in the community and in a variety of places.",32,,
213,0.97,1501.533,1509.074,"And, of course, that put our health care workers also at risk in these areas.",32,,
214,0.97,1509.074,1520.385,"So we're trying to work, Prioritize our health care workers, our first responders, and the people who we're getting early diagnosis on.",32,,
215,0.97,1520.385,1524.99,Those are the primary containment.,32,,
216,0.97,1524.99,1528.894,"The mitigation strategies, we're really trying to implement.",32,,
217,0.97,1528.894,1534.399,In the health care world they're called non pharmaceutical with the applications and vaccines.,32,,
218,0.97,1534.399,1539.004,What we try to do is we implement the best strategies.,32,,
219,0.97,1539.004,1539.671,The messages you've heard here.,32,,
220,0.97,1539.671,1544.376,Wash your hands and social distancing.,32,,
221,0.97,1544.376,1545.81,Elbow bumps.,32,,
222,0.97,1545.81,1548.046,Careful about shaking hands and those things.,32,,
223,0.97,1548.046,1550.215,"When you're sick, stay home.",32,,
224,0.97,1550.215,1555.186,Those are all the strategies we put in place.,32,,
225,0.97,1555.186,1565.13,"With this particular virus, we know it's Droplet form and so covering your cough and stay home if you're sick are all the messages around mitigation.",32,,
226,0.97,1565.13,1584.649,We've taken a bit more aggressive steps in the last couple of days around the community Mitigations asking that if businesses and government agencies can have people Telecommute they should be at home Telecommuting to isolate and separate folks out so we don't spread the virus if it's in our area.,32,,
227,0.97,1584.649,1588.453,"I will um, probably shouldn't be showing it but it's going to show up in your work environment.",32,,
228,0.97,1588.453,1591.256,It's going to show up with people we know.,32,,
229,0.97,1591.256,1594.859,So we need to do our best to mitigate this in every way possible.,32,,
230,0.97,1594.859,1597.262,We are asking people to reconsider.,32,,
231,0.97,1597.262,1599.531,These are AARE all recommendations.,32,,
232,0.97,1599.531,1606.271,We're asking people to really consider community gatherings and what that number needs to be.,32,,
233,0.97,1606.271,1607.973,There's no magic number.,32,,
234,0.97,1607.973,1610.241,It's a number that came out as one suggestion.,32,,
235,0.97,1610.241,1621.686,But I think you have to look at that case by case and really take that into consideration and what's best for your and your community and where those gatherings are happening.,32,,
236,0.97,1621.686,1630.195,We got pushed on what is a large group and that's a hard thing to respond because there's context with each of those we want to consider differently.,32,,
237,0.97,1630.195,1632.797,We're also looking around community Mitigations.,32,,
238,0.97,1632.797,1636.167,We have deployed--I've lost.,32,,
239,0.97,1636.167,1639.17,I don't know what's happened in the last two days.,32,,
240,0.97,1639.17,1642.374,We had 17 people show up on Monday from the CDC.,32,,
241,0.97,1642.374,1643.308,They're building policy with us.,32,,
242,0.97,1643.308,1645.377,We are the epicenter in this country.,32,,
243,0.97,1645.377,1650.882,"We are building policies and recommendations in real time and, again, those are going to change.",32,,
244,0.97,1650.882,1655.186,So we're grateful for them and they've been really helpful in this process.,32,,
245,0.97,1655.186,1659.824,We have the best thinkers and best experienced people working in these areas.,32,,
246,0.97,1659.824,1667.932,"So we're thinking in sectors, schools, business environments, we're thinking about a large gatherings such as sports arenas.",32,,
247,0.97,1667.932,1680.412,We're thinking about people who travel through airplanes and ferry boats and everything that approach so it is the most sed helpful advice we can give.,32,,
248,0.97,1680.412,1686.351,Those are ruling out as best as we can as fast as we can and they'll be more coming out.,32,,
249,0.97,1686.351,1703.368,The School-Based recommendations we're hoping we'll roll out today and we are working today we're working with the CDC finalizing up around homelessness and shelters and what is the recommendations that should be helping to guide what happens in our shelters and environments.,32,,
250,0.97,1703.368,1704.235,Really being built in real time.,32,,
251,0.97,1704.235,1708.673,These are some of of our mitigation strategies.,32,,
252,0.97,1708.673,1712.844,"Colleagues, I know there's a number of people who have questions.",33,,
253,0.97,1712.844,1716.081,I'm hoping we can get through the presentation of each presenter.,33,,
254,0.97,1716.081,1717.382,And ask a series of questions.,33,,
255,0.97,1717.382,1719.25,I know you have a time constraint.,33,,
256,0.97,1719.25,1726.791,So we want you to get through your prosecution and then to our Council colleagues I'll make sure we go down the line.,33,,
257,0.97,1726.791,1727.659,I'll hit one area.,34,,
258,0.97,1727.659,1730.862,I want to make sure I'm getting what you need.,34,,
259,0.97,1730.862,1733.898,A big push from everyone is testing.,34,,
260,0.97,1733.898,1738.203,So let me tell you a little bit about where we're at in testing.,34,,
261,0.97,1738.203,1741.473,"So, this is probably one of the hottest questions right now.",34,,
262,0.97,1741.473,1745.41,That we get through our call center.,34,,
263,0.97,1745.41,1749.214,So I just want to set a context.,34,,
264,0.97,1749.214,1753.918,"Again, brand new virus.",34,,
265,0.97,1753.918,1755.487,Quickly developed.,34,,
266,0.97,1755.487,1764.829,"An ability to test for this virus a few weeks ago, we really had to Prioritize who were the highest risk and who we thought would be at risk.",34,,
267,0.97,1764.829,1774.906,We really need to hold the people that we thought needed to be tested from an Epiperspective would most likely be infected and carrying the virus.,34,,
268,0.97,1774.906,1778.243,"As I said last Friday, we pushed those testing kits out.",34,,
269,0.97,1778.243,1782.213,We've been able to do that with the state lab.,34,,
270,0.97,1782.213,1794.559,They're Operationalizing two tests a day and as reported U- Dub has now made their contribution in setting up their LABS and we'll be bringing it up to a thousand and we're pushing for commercial LABS to follow.,34,,
271,0.97,1794.559,1797.962,And my understanding there are a number of commercial LABS that will be coming Online.,34,,
272,0.97,1797.962,1806.771,So testing as a whole will be more accessible for folks and they should be working with their health care providers in determining if they need to do that.,34,,
273,0.97,1806.771,1824.856,I will say that it's an important thing to say because I think it helps quiet the fear of it is the treatment after a confirmed case of Covid is no different because there's no medication that is a dedicated medication or vaccine for Covid.,34,,
274,0.97,1824.856,1832.163,So we treat it like other respiratory illnesses and we work with medical providers in order to do that.,34,,
275,0.97,1832.163,1845.21,I understand the urgency to test for people but if they have those symptoms they should be working with their medical providers and those medical providers will be attending to them based on what their health needs are at that time.,34,,
276,0.97,1845.21,1846.477,"So, I'll stop there.",34,,
277,0.97,1846.477,1849.414,And I'll be happy to answer questions before I go.,34,,
278,0.97,1849.414,1850.715,However you'd like to go.,34,,
279,0.97,1850.715,1854.519,We really appreciate your time and thank you for the details.,35,,
280,0.97,1854.519,1861.593,"I know that your team, your front of the line team have been working 24/7.",35,,
281,0.97,1861.593,1865.93,Please send a huge amount of appreciation.,35,,
282,0.97,1865.93,1870.134,First Council member Herbold and then Council member Morales.,35,,
283,0.97,1870.134,1871.336,Thank you.,36,,
284,0.97,1871.336,1877.442,I'm just going to ask both my questions and then maybe we can get all the questions out and then you can answer.,36,,
285,0.97,1877.442,1878.943,Go ahead and then we'll.,37,,
286,0.97,1878.943,1881.813,You assume my brain is still really working well.,38,,
287,0.97,1881.813,1882.08,Okay.,39,,
288,0.97,1882.08,1883.014,All right.,40,,
289,0.97,1883.014,1884.849,Any way you want to do it.,41,,
290,0.97,1884.849,1899.264,"So, when you were talking about the containment strategies, you mentioned that you were working to follow up with folks who with whom you had contact.",42,,
291,0.97,1899.264,1908.072,Are you referring to because people are getting Rerls for testing from their health care providers but they're not coming to you.,42,,
292,0.97,1908.072,1911.075,When you said you're following up who did you mean?,42,,
293,0.97,1911.075,1911.576,Thank you.,43,,
294,0.97,1911.576,1922.687,So the way that the public health system works throughout the country is there are what we call Mandiseases that people are mandated to report.,43,,
295,0.97,1922.687,1925.056,They're required to report that in two ways.,43,,
296,0.97,1925.056,1931.396,A confirmed lab test or a medical community whether that's an individual provider or the facilities themselves.,43,,
297,0.97,1931.396,1933.798,They're mandated to report the results of a test.,43,,
298,0.97,1933.798,1939.17,"And, we get that information through electronic process called the Washington disease tracking system.",43,,
299,0.97,1939.17,1946.511,And we are able to see a positive in that system and we get the person's information and phone number and contact.,43,,
300,0.97,1946.511,1951.816,When you said contacts you meant people who have been positively identified as having the virus.,44,,
301,0.97,1951.816,1952.583,Right.,45,,
302,0.97,1952.583,1960.024,And then we talk to them about who they've been in contact with and in order to do the quarantine and mitigation strategies.,45,,
303,0.97,1960.024,1971.202,"So, um, you'd mentioned that you're--it sounded as if you haven't gotten through to all T█Hose people yet, is that accurate?",46,,
304,0.97,1971.202,1973.204,"Yeah, that's accurate.",47,,
305,0.97,1973.204,1989.253,We are getting--one of the part of the systems that we're trying to improve is some of the results coming in is when we move out of the public system only do the health testing and then into the broader community the Seattle flu study found a case that was our case.,47,,
306,0.97,1989.253,1993.157,It was reported up in Snohomish County through their process.,47,,
307,0.97,1993.157,2000.865,So we're working with all of these different systems that are out testing using complete information about the individual and how we contact them.,47,,
308,0.97,2000.865,2003.868,So we have not been able to follow up on all of them.,47,,
309,0.97,2003.868,2005.269,What percentage would you say?,48,,
310,0.97,2005.269,2008.873,I would say the majority of them we've been able to follow up with.,49,,
311,0.97,2008.873,2010.775,All right.,50,,
312,0.97,2010.775,2013.277,"And, then, moving over to specifically testing.",50,,
313,0.97,2013.277,2029.093,"You know, I think it's important to place this in the context you mentioned that um, state testing has only been up since last Friday and in the United States I saw reported there's only been 600 tests done in the entire United States.",50,,
314,0.97,2029.093,2052.216,"But, I would still like to know what your estimate is of the number of people who have been tested in King County and given that the CDC's recommendation for testing um, is not just that um, everyone can get tested . It's that everyone who has a referral from a health care provider can get tested.",50,,
315,0.97,2052.216,2066.697,"What would you recommend to folks who don't have health care providers and if that is a barrier, how can we work together to make sure it's not a barrier for people who are presenting symptoms and don't have a health care provider to make that recommendation?",50,,
316,0.97,2066.697,2067.532,Yeah.,51,,
317,0.97,2067.532,2069.434,That's a tough question and a good question.,51,,
318,0.97,2069.434,2075.039,As a society we have struggled with that for a long time.,51,,
319,0.97,2075.039,2077.642,We've been rustling with that as a state for a long time.,51,,
320,0.97,2077.642,2087.552,My best advice if you do not have a health care provider we have community health clinics that are spread throughout.,51,,
321,0.97,2087.552,2091.656,We have a great system throughout here and Tlut Seattle.,51,,
322,0.97,2091.656,2097.028,There's going to be a briefing with them this week and getting them to stand up and be ready for that.,51,,
323,0.97,2097.028,2101.466,So we don't want to turn people away who have health care needs.,51,,
324,0.97,2101.466,2114.879,"Just to your point on the recommendations, I want to be really clear is that there are things that we can actually screen out and if people have flu-like symptoms there's a flu panel that we can tell you you're positive for flu.",51,,
325,0.97,2114.879,2120.685,When moving to the Coronavirus testing is when nothing else is showing up as positive we go to that particular area.,51,,
326,0.97,2120.685,2126.958,So there's a way that the medical community is responding in order to be able to screen those out through a process.,51,,
327,0.97,2126.958,2133.898,To make sure those who are symptomatic that they're getting those tests that they need.,51,,
328,0.97,2133.898,2136.901,"Thank you, very much.",52,,
329,0.97,2136.901,2138.569,"Council member, Morales.",53,,
330,0.97,2138.569,2141.272,I want to follow up on this testing related question.,54,,
331,0.97,2141.272,2143.774,And then I have a different question.,54,,
332,0.97,2143.774,2151.816,So you mentioned you're going to be able to go from tests hopefully to a thousand a day.,54,,
333,0.97,2151.816,2157.922,Is there a similar increase in capacity for the lab results and lab capacity?,54,,
334,0.97,2157.922,2159.79,That's one question.,54,,
335,0.97,2159.79,2167.632,"And, then, we've been talking about what size groups to limit and 10 was sort of sounds like a random number.",54,,
336,0.97,2167.632,2181.913,"As a mother of a child with 26 other kids in her class, I'm sure lots of families are eager to hear what the school recommendations are and we know that that will put burden on families if their kids aren't in school.",54,,
337,0.97,2181.913,2185.516,Especially if they have to work and don't have the ability to stay home.,54,,
338,0.97,2185.516,2197.128,"And, if we're talking about protecting public Hept we know that kids are vectors for all kinds of things and the teachers and other school staff also need to have their health considered.",54,,
339,0.97,2197.128,2201.065,So whatever additional information you can provide about when the school report will be ready.,54,,
340,0.97,2201.065,2201.866,Yeah.,55,,
341,0.97,2201.866,2207.538,"So for those who tuned in yesterday to the briefing, Dr.",55,,
342,0.97,2207.538,2211.676,Duchin addressed this question from and it's in our press Úrelease if you've not got it.,55,,
343,0.97,2211.676,2216.647,I want to make sure everybody gets a chance to see that.,55,,
344,0.97,2216.647,2221.953,The thing that we're learning about this virus worldwide is it's not affecting children.,55,,
345,0.97,2221.953,2223.688,We don't know enough about that.,55,,
346,0.97,2223.688,2229.794,It's really affecting people who are 60 years and older and people who have underlying health conditions.,55,,
347,0.97,2229.794,2231.562,That puts them into a different category.,55,,
348,0.97,2231.562,2239.77,One of the things we learned about H1N1 was that it was disruptive to the system when we closed schools down.,55,,
349,0.97,2239.77,2241.906,We do not close schools is the register.,55,,
350,0.97,2241.906,2252.483,"If we have a confirmed Covid within a school system, we will work with that school district and if proper, we will close that school district down for cleaning in those areas.",55,,
351,0.97,2252.483,2255.686,"So, at this point, we're not asking for people to close schools down.",55,,
352,0.97,2255.686,2286.15,"One of the things that we see that happens in that environment is you can appreciate is when you have working parents especially in a variety of our health care arenas, if they have to stay home it pulls them out of our first responders, it pulls them out of our health care systems and we need them there and knowing that children have not been where we have seen critical outcomes around death or even strong hospitalization is we're not recommending at this time that schools are closed.",55,,
353,0.97,2286.15,2291.155,We're working with them on mitigation strategies about what you can do to keep you environment cleaner.,55,,
354,0.97,2291.155,2301.165,"Make sure that proper hand washing, GEL, all those things around helping to mitigate within those environments.",55,,
355,0.97,2301.165,2309.34,"But, at this time, not recommending closing schools unless something significantly changes based on the disease currently.",55,,
356,0.97,2309.34,2313.077,The state report yesterday they've had no Backlogs in their testing.,56,,
357,0.97,2313.077,2314.912,I think their capacity is currently there.,56,,
358,0.97,2314.912,2325.289,And I think now with U-Dub coming on today I can't speak to their capacity but I think if they're operating they've built their teams to be able to respond to that level.,56,,
359,0.97,2325.289,2327.491,We'll see what's unfolding in real time.,56,,
360,0.97,2327.491,2330.294,We'll keep an eye on that.,56,,
361,0.97,2330.294,2332.463,I'm feeling better that more capacity is coming Online.,56,,
362,0.97,2332.463,2336.901,It helps us get it out to the community and the people who need those testings.,56,,
363,0.97,2336.901,2337.301,Thank you.,57,,
364,0.97,2337.301,2339.17,"Thank you, so much.",58,,
365,0.97,2339.17,2341.105,I have a few questions as well.,58,,
366,0.97,2341.105,2352.917,"When we talk about the mitigation strategy, has public health put out recommendations for how many hand washing facilities per population units that each city should have in our County?",58,,
367,0.97,2352.917,2354.719,I can go back and look.,59,,
368,0.97,2354.719,2357.922,I've not been in any of those conversations.,59,,
369,0.97,2357.922,2361.025,I know there's been some conversations internally here.,59,,
370,0.97,2361.025,2363.527,It sounds like I was told before coming over.,59,,
371,0.97,2363.527,2367.398,But we have not put out that recommendation out at this point.,59,,
372,0.97,2367.398,2367.932,Great.,60,,
373,0.97,2367.932,2369.9,"Yes, I think that came from me.",60,,
374,0.97,2369.9,2375.139,We're very interested in portable hand washing facilities across our city.,60,,
375,0.97,2375.139,2377.908,Can you talk more about the incubation period.,60,,
376,0.97,2377.908,2387.151,"If an individual feels they had come in contact with somebody who may have been sick, how long do you think it would maybe take for these symptoms to start showing.",60,,
377,0.97,2387.151,2387.952,Good question.,61,,
378,0.97,2387.952,2391.055,"So, again, science in real time.",62,,
379,0.97,2391.055,2397.328,What we're seeing is that we're telling people to quarantine for 14 days.,62,,
380,0.97,2397.328,2405.035,We've had on SETS as early that we've seen here around four or five days and some that are even later than that.,62,,
381,0.97,2405.035,2409.74,So we're telling people two weeks if they've come in close contact.,62,,
382,0.97,2409.74,2416.08,It's most likely with people who are going to be in close contact with somebody who is a known case.,62,,
383,0.97,2416.08,2424.388,Often time family members in facilities where there's constant a number of hours they spend with folks are probably most likely to be able to become infected.,62,,
384,0.97,2424.388,2431.529,So we ask them if they have been in contact or close contact if they home quarantine themselves for 14 days.,62,,
385,0.97,2431.529,2432.463,Okay.,63,,
386,0.97,2432.463,2434.565,"Thank you, very much.",63,,
387,0.97,2434.565,2439.436,Another question about communication with some of our providers.,63,,
388,0.97,2439.436,2445.609,Is there any specific protocol to any of our Preschools early learning facilities and perhaps some of our colleagues later.,63,,
389,0.97,2445.609,2453.484,You don't have to jump in right now but put a note we're interested in how we're communicating with our providers.,63,,
390,0.97,2453.484,2456.32,Any specific directives to those who are on the younger age?,63,,
391,0.97,2456.32,2457.288,Yeah.,64,,
392,0.97,2457.288,2458.189,That's a good question as well.,64,,
393,0.97,2458.189,2464.795,"So, I will say that the school guidance is coming out from preschool to college.",64,,
394,0.97,2464.795,2466.096,It's not just K-12.,64,,
395,0.97,2466.096,2466.73,Okay.,65,,
396,0.97,2466.73,2472.036,And what about 0 to 30.,65,,
397,0.97,2472.036,2472.203,.,65,,
398,0.97,2472.203,2473.904,0 to 3?,66,,
399,0.97,2473.904,2476.507,I thought that's a big group.,67,,
400,0.97,2476.507,2479.944,There are still many in school.,68,,
401,0.97,2479.944,2484.014,"So, yes, I don't have anything on the zeros yet.",68,,
402,0.97,2484.014,2488.919,"I focus on preschool, school age kids and adult learning.",68,,
403,0.97,2488.919,2489.653,Okay.,69,,
404,0.97,2489.653,2501.065,"One quick comment as we talk about making sure people stay home or if they feel sick, we want to remind people they have paid sick and safe days in the city and in the state.",69,,
405,0.97,2501.065,2508.272,One area that we know they can access their sick days is when their school is closed by a public official.,69,,
406,0.97,2508.272,2523.387,One thing we'll potentially be bringing forward is making sure that we amended our city statute as well so it doesn't have to be closed by a public official for the parents within a school or a child care facility to get access to those paid days.,69,,
407,0.97,2523.387,2531.695,Because you know a lot of these schools we saw a dozen or so early learning facilities and schools close out of an abundance of caution.,69,,
408,0.97,2531.695,2545.576,"Which we appreciate people are taking the steps to keep their facilities very clean in light of the virus, but we want to make sure those parents working parents anywhere in the city know they can access that paid sick leave carefully.",69,,
409,0.97,2545.576,2546.877,We advise.,70,,
410,0.97,2546.877,2548.012,We're giving these recommendations out.,70,,
411,0.97,2548.012,2556.687,"But as you know, it's the school's authority to be able to make that decision in what they want to do in an abundance of caution to protect their kids.",70,,
412,0.97,2556.687,2558.289,That's their call.,70,,
413,0.97,2558.289,2561.025,We are happy to advise and talk about that with them.,70,,
414,0.97,2561.025,2561.792,Excellent.,71,,
415,0.97,2561.792,2563.227,Thank you.,71,,
416,0.97,2563.227,2591.455,"And, I think the last question for me, given the news that I think is spreading very fast when an individual is identified with Coronavirus, for example, we're finding out from Twitter when someone has a virus and Amazon sends out an alert, what is the private sector's responsibility for notifying public health in addition to what you mentioned about individuals?",71,,
417,0.97,2591.455,2599.663,"How does the private sector as businesses inform public health of when there's an outbreak or not an outbreak, a case?",71,,
418,0.97,2599.663,2606.47,Well if the public system is working the way it should we should know before they do.,72,,
419,0.97,2606.47,2610.574,If there is a confirmed case those lab reports should be coming to us.,72,,
420,0.97,2610.574,2629.293,"And, the thing that sometimes they're a little ahead of us if we have, for example, if you have a larger employer that we notify an individual that they are positive for Covid, then they may be reaching out to their employer before we're able to get to their employer to let them know.",72,,
421,0.97,2629.293,2631.528,"Again, this is going to be fluid and changing.",72,,
422,0.97,2631.528,2636.967,"If we talk about we're up in the thousands, the communication becomes more difficult in sequencing.",72,,
423,0.97,2636.967,2641.171,"Colleagues, any additional questions?",73,,
424,0.97,2641.171,2649.58,"I will note, I appreciate the Proactive response of public health has had along with the partners in King County to identify isolation.",73,,
425,0.97,2649.58,2652.783,I have a question chairwoman.,74,,
426,0.97,2652.783,2654.418,"Yes, I hear you.",75,,
427,0.97,2654.418,2655.319,I have a question.,76,,
428,0.97,2655.319,2658.155,"Please, go ahead if you're watching.",77,,
429,0.97,2658.155,2659.223,Hello.,78,,
430,0.97,2659.223,2660.224,She's on mute.,79,,
431,0.97,2660.224,2665.229,"We can hear you Council member, Juarez.",80,,
432,0.97,2665.229,2667.231,Go ahead.,80,,
433,0.97,2667.231,2667.564,One second.,80,,
434,0.97,2667.564,2670.834,If you're watching on TV I can still hear you.,80,,
435,0.97,2670.834,2672.102,Okay.,81,,
436,0.97,2672.102,2673.904,I got it.,81,,
437,0.97,2673.904,2687.317,I know I appreciate the questions that you've asked to focus on the children and the vulnerable populations but I wanted to know what we're doing for outreach for our elderly community.,81,,
438,0.97,2687.317,2689.453,Thank you Council member Juarez.,82,,
439,0.97,2689.453,2692.256,Yeah.,83,,
440,0.97,2692.256,2699.163,So we have a committee mitigation team that is together and working on recommendations as well as outreach.,83,,
441,0.97,2699.163,2704.334,I haven't said in that call center to know what they've done specifically.,83,,
442,0.97,2704.334,2716.98,Working with long term care facilities across our County and within the city is to making sure that they Aring the best precautions they know in order around control with their environments.,83,,
443,0.97,2716.98,2726.857,So our most vulnerable that we're concerned about because of the congregate setting Anded ability to spread easily is in the long term facilities.,83,,
444,0.97,2726.857,2731.261,We have teams together and developing strategies and again really looking.,83,,
445,0.97,2731.261,2744.208,"If the 20% who are most vulnerable are 60 and older and people with underlying health conditions, how do we reach into that community and get the information they need.",83,,
446,0.97,2744.208,2745.008,.,83,,
447,0.97,2745.008,2749.847,"Council member, Juarez do you have any additional questions?",84,,
448,0.97,2749.847,2750.214,No.,85,,
449,0.97,2750.214,2750.914,Thank you.,85,,
450,0.97,2750.914,2776.24,If I can add we can provide a little additional context in terms of what the city of Seattle is doing in regards to our outreach and engagement efforts and obviously the focus populations that you've Referenced are ones that we have keen interest in making Thur they get the information they need and Jason Johnson and others at the table can speak to that a little later in our presentation.,86,,
451,0.97,2776.24,2778.942,"Colleagues, any additional questions.",87,,
452,0.97,2778.942,2780.811,"Council member, Juarez thank you for your question.",87,,
453,0.97,2780.811,2787.351,"Thank you, so much.",88,,
454,0.97,2787.351,2788.152,Mr. Warsham.,88,,
455,0.97,2788.152,2789.92,We appreciate the containment strategy.,88,,
456,0.97,2789.92,2804.034,"I know that public health is always interested in doing as much community engagement as you possibly can and during these times when you're trying to act as fast as possible, please know you have my support.",88,,
457,0.97,2804.034,2807.838,I think this Council wants to be as supportive as we possibly can.,88,,
458,0.97,2807.838,2812.176,Obviously you've been working in close contact with the executive team at the table here.,88,,
459,0.97,2812.176,2828.792,"If there's anything you can do to support you as you roll out additional sites or strategies especially for the elderly and those working in long term care facilities and others working with vulnerable populations, please let us know, we really appreciate your work.",88,,
460,0.97,2828.792,2829.793,Thank you so much.,89,,
461,0.97,2829.793,2833.797,"And with that, we'll let you run if you need to.",90,,
462,0.97,2833.797,2835.399,Thank you.,91,,
463,0.97,2835.399,2836.9,Okay.,92,,
464,0.97,2836.9,2845.309,"I will add our appreciation, the Mayor's appreciation for director Hayes and Dr.",92,,
465,0.97,2845.309,2847.01,Dutchin's incredible work.,92,,
466,0.97,2847.01,2854.618,They've been working around the clock and certainly public health has been doing an incredible job with this situation.,92,,
467,0.97,2854.618,2868.332,"So, with that, the next element of our presentation today, we wanted to shift now to the city's operational response and we'll start with acting director Laurel Nelson for the office emergency management.",92,,
468,0.97,2868.332,2888.919,I wanted to make sure we shared a little bit of the structural contours of how from the world health organization on down to CDC to the Department of health at the state level to our local public health agencies to structurally works at a high level.,92,,
469,0.97,2888.919,2891.321,And having stood up our emergency operations functions.,92,,
470,0.97,2891.321,2911.775,Wanted to make sure we level set in terms of how we're organized and I'll take a moment to acknowledge that we've also invited back to the table former director Barb Graff who has not left the region yet and we should lean in on her 40 years of experience in emergency management.,92,,
471,0.97,2911.775,2915.045,One of the leading experts in our back yard.,92,,
472,0.97,2915.045,2919.182,We should certainly tap her expertise while we still have it.,92,,
473,0.97,2919.182,2923.787,So Barb is able to help us answer some questions today as well.,92,,
474,0.97,2923.787,2932.095,"And, with that, and also with the leadership of Barb and Laurel we're one of the few accredited emergency management programs across the country.",92,,
475,0.97,2932.095,2937.2,So we should be proud of the work that they have done and the work of the entire cabinet today.,92,,
476,0.97,2937.2,2941.571,"So, with that, Laurel, if you can provide some context.",92,,
477,0.97,2941.571,2941.872,Great.,93,,
478,0.97,2941.872,2947.11,"Thanks, Council members for allowing us to be here and share our stories.",93,,
479,0.97,2947.11,2955.285,"First off, I want to acknowledge my colleagues not only here at the table but back in the emergency operation center behind the scenes are all the staff.",93,,
480,0.97,2955.285,2963.293,They're working very hard on a number of these missions and ensuring that we're responding effectively to the community needs under this situation.,93,,
481,0.97,2963.293,2977.541,"So, as many of you have been briefed, the office of emergency minute really is responsible for coordinating our city wide capability and that involves the planning that we do on an ongoing basis.",93,,
482,0.97,2977.541,2997.461,"Since 2007, the city has had pandemic Affluenza incident Annex and with that when we faced the 2009 H1N1 we took that to help guide our response then and it's helping to guide our response now.",93,,
483,0.97,2997.461,3007.804,"Since 2009, we have constantly used inner departmental stake holders to be able to do our ongoing planning and that continues to be what we're doing today.",93,,
484,0.97,3007.804,3014.111,The city has good muscle memory when it comes to good principles of good planning.,93,,
485,0.97,3014.111,3025.288,It's something we do year in and year out and we've already got that great network with our colleagues to be able to do that planning.,93,,
486,0.97,3025.288,3047.978,"Um, as Mike mentioned or deputy Mayor Fong mentioned, this is an international response and from the world health organization down to the CDC who then guides what happens at the State Department level, State Department health and then down to our public health Seattle King County, we have to be lock step with our local public health and we have been.",93,,
487,0.97,3047.978,3061.892,"We have great working relationships with them and with that, we have also got an office of emergency minute staff member embedded in their health and medical area and have been doing so since the middle part of February.",93,,
488,0.97,3061.892,3065.395,So we are in concert when it comes to their response.,93,,
489,0.97,3065.395,3077.541,"In addition to just drawing on those planning efforts, many of you know and we've been here before, Barb has been here before on briefing you out on previous Activations that we have.",94,,
490,0.97,3077.541,3087.417,We leverage those experiences each time to build up on what we can do to be Adaptive.,94,,
491,0.97,3087.417,3098.228,All of our Covid planning and preparation as I mentioned is reliant not only on the public health Seattle King County but also on the Northwest Halth care response network in our hospitals.,94,,
492,0.97,3098.228,3104.968,So on an ongoing basis we have Dialogs with all of our stake holders.,94,,
493,0.97,3104.968,3111.608,Those stake holders are in constant meetings annually and on a monthly basis in our community meetings we hold.,94,,
494,0.97,3111.608,3113.543,Those relationships are already there.,94,,
495,0.97,3113.543,3126.59,"So as deputy Mayor Fong mentioned since mid February, the office of emergency management has been leading the city wide planning effort to get us prepared for Covid response and that's involved a number of factors.",94,,
496,0.97,3126.59,3136.466,I just want to share with you some of the things we've been doing since mid February and then transition into what it looks like what we're currently dealing with.,94,,
497,0.97,3136.466,3140.804,"So, since mid February, we've been doing every Tuesday planning meetings.",94,,
498,0.97,3140.804,3144.808,We bring people down into the emergency operating center.,94,,
499,0.97,3144.808,3148.512,We had I believe nine mission areas we were focusing on.,94,,
500,0.97,3148.512,3153.817,All elements out of that existing pandemic flu plan that I mentioned dated back to 2007.,94,,
501,0.97,3153.817,3161.725,"With that, a huge focus on city continuity operations and functions.",94,,
502,0.97,3161.725,3165.896,So we have convened folks in working on those particular plans.,94,,
503,0.97,3165.896,3171.301,Other strings of missions that we've been working on is our work force resiliency.,94,,
504,0.97,3171.301,3175.705,So how do we ensure that our work force can come to work.,94,,
505,0.97,3175.705,3178.808,What does it look like when they get sick?,94,,
506,0.97,3178.808,3183.413,What does it look like when we need to take care of the hygiene practices.,94,,
507,0.97,3183.413,3187.35,The facility faced with a Covid positive individual in that environment.,94,,
508,0.97,3187.35,3195.525,In addition to the plans is really the backbone to that is what do we do from the I.T.,94,,
509,0.97,3195.525,3198.662,Side to make sure we can support Teleworking.,94,,
510,0.97,3198.662,3213.577,So that looks forward to all aspects of conference calls and we do a lot of conference calls and we'll see the Seattle squeeze was a great opportunity for us to practice that and we really great a great muscle memory with that.,94,,
511,0.97,3213.577,3222.385,We have to be prepared for a scenario of possibly 40% of our work force being gone and that goes back to the continuity of operations plans.,94,,
512,0.97,3222.385,3235.865,So in the last few weeks the departments not only do they have a basic coop plan but they're able to go back and look at how they're going to Operationalize them.,94,,
513,0.97,3235.865,3243.44,What does that look like and what can we do with the other employees who aren't necessarily in those critical roles being able to support them for Teleworking.,94,,
514,0.97,3243.44,3263.994,"So, you know, we're looking at not only all the population that we need to serve in the city of Seattle but we have to make sure all those services, emergency medical services, fire response, public safety, the power, the water, the solid waste, the waste water system all of these things we have to make sure they're functional.",94,,
515,0.97,3263.994,3276.439,So all of the city departments especially our core Department operations have those plans in addition to the legislative Department also has your own continuity operations plan.,94,,
516,0.97,3276.439,3281.911,"Other key strategies you've seen today where the Teleworking, working at social distancing.",94,,
517,0.97,3281.911,3288.251,"Even though we haven't been officially required to do social distancing, we've been practicing that in the Eoc.",94,,
518,0.97,3288.251,3299.763,So what does it look like if we need to be in the Eoc and we need to spread people apart and be able to do that social distancing and work still needs to continue.,94,,
519,0.97,3299.763,3310.674,Hr our human resources Department is doing a huge body of work to make sure we have our work force ready to go and we can support them in a whole Plethora of ways.,94,,
520,0.97,3310.674,3325.355,I'm going to let my colleagues in with deputy Mayor and director Jason Johnson talk about the initiatives and the focus we've been doing on vulnerable populations.,94,,
521,0.97,3325.355,3326.089,We are lock step.,94,,
522,0.97,3326.089,3334.531,And thank you for continuing to echo all those positive strategies that we as individuals can take out in the community.,94,,
523,0.97,3357.754,3367.797,"In February, I also want to share with you, we were leaning forward, we had a look like if it will open up the emergency operations center.",95,,
524,0.97,3367.797,3370.433,Planning assumptions and having a concept of operations of what that would look like.,95,,
525,0.97,3370.433,3382.011,"Obviously, we are in that mode now and as deputy Mayor Fong mentioned, we are currently activated right now Monday to Friday, 9:00 - 1 am.",95,,
526,0.97,3382.011,3387.15,"Again, we are trying to practice not having a lot of people in a space, and looking at what that is going to look like.",95,,
527,0.97,3387.15,3395.825,"Without, we will share, what it may look like for a virtual Elc.",95,,
528,0.97,3395.825,3399.796,"Maybe a point when we need to get, how do we do coordination calls, and how to reduce typing?",95,,
529,0.97,3399.796,3405.168,"And, doing those types of meetings beyond having people physically in one space.",95,,
530,0.97,3405.168,3418.214,"So, just to give you some idea of what we are focusing on currently in the emergency operation center, clearly, and this is a thread, no matter what activation we do, we have to maintain Situational awareness.",95,,
531,0.97,3418.214,3429.759,"So, we're looking at all those data points that allow us to paint the picture of what is going on out there, and try to be ahead of the curve as best as possible.",95,,
532,0.97,3429.759,3431.394,How are we tracking absenteeism of the workforce.,95,,
533,0.97,3431.394,3432.796,What critical facilities are closed or open?,95,,
534,0.97,3432.796,3434.697,What are the impacts to the community out there?,95,,
535,0.97,3434.697,3436.666,What is the call volume at the customer service Bureau?,95,,
536,0.97,3436.666,3439.102,What are call volumes that are 911 centers?,95,,
537,0.97,3439.102,3441.571,In addition to that is this close relationship with public health.,95,,
538,0.97,3441.571,3448.411,How can we support them and cooperate with them as closely as possible?,95,,
539,0.97,3448.411,3459.189,"The third objective we are focused on is again, just amplifying in every possible Venue, Avenue that we can, on what those messages are for our community members.",95,,
540,0.97,3459.189,3462.125,The fourth objective we are focusing on is just maintaining city services.,95,,
541,0.97,3462.125,3467.197,"Again, that was practically down to the departments and what they are doing with their coop plans.",95,,
542,0.97,3467.197,3477.24,"A fifth objective is focused on safety and security of our At- risk populations . and again, you will hear from my colleague, director Johnson on that.",95,,
543,0.97,3477.24,3481.211,"And then our last one is, we have to be nimble.",95,,
544,0.97,3481.211,3488.651,"So, our six objective is how do we address and identify any policy issues?",95,,
545,0.97,3488.651,3502.031,"One of the things that we always teacher the emergency operation center is, we have to be able to leverage the brain trust of the people that, not only are in the emergency operations center, but also, our colleagues in other departments and agencies and organizations.",95,,
546,0.97,3502.031,3510.173,"This is a novel situation, and we have to be nimble and we have to be adapted.",95,,
547,0.97,3510.173,3518.281,"So, anyone can bring a great idea to the table that could help to that problem solving for those particular solutions.",95,,
548,0.97,3518.281,3521.584,"I just want to touch, there was a question about schools and Daycare's.",96,,
549,0.97,3521.584,3526.155,"So, the Department of education and early learning has been in the emergency operations center along with the school district.",96,,
550,0.97,3526.155,3533.363,"So, dl has contracts with well over 197 day care centers, and 84 Preschools.",96,,
551,0.97,3533.363,3550.813,"And, they are in the contact with those Preschools, and with the schools to make sure that we understand what is going on with them and what those impacts are.",96,,
552,0.97,3550.813,3565.395,"I will also share with you, we have been reaching out to all the college systems and understand what is going on with the college systems and maintaining that is another data point, what they are seeing for the student population, and how they are having to adapt their operations, depending on what they are dealing with for Covid . that is my peace.",96,,
553,0.97,3565.395,3565.895,Thank you.,96,,
554,0.97,3565.895,3568.698,Councilmember Herbold.,97,,
555,0.97,3568.698,3569.098,Thank you.,98,,
556,0.97,3569.098,3569.699,Just two questions.,98,,
557,0.97,3569.699,3591.454,The first being that the Mayor's communication Department directors on March 1 talked a little bit about the continuity of operations plans and identified a goal of March 13 to have those plans Operationalized.,98,,
558,0.97,3591.454,3592.488,Has that date been Reevaluated?,98,,
559,0.97,3592.488,3594.223,It seems a little far out.,98,,
560,0.97,3594.223,3601.164,"But, I don't know everything that Operationalizing the plan, what all that consists of.",98,,
561,0.97,3601.164,3608.271,Thanks for that question.,99,,
562,0.97,3608.271,3609.572,We are staying with that date.,99,,
563,0.97,3609.572,3611.441,"A lot of work has already done, Councilmember Herbold.",99,,
564,0.97,3611.441,3632.996,"They just need to look at for instance, you may hear from the chief talk about more TACTICALLY, as they look at their workforce, what does that look like on them needing to Pivot their operations if they lose, just like Kirkland has lost 25% of the workforce . What is it look like for the fire Department?",99,,
565,0.97,3632.996,3634.53,What is it look like for the police Department?,99,,
566,0.97,3634.53,3638.701,"What employees do not need to be field responders, and what do we do with them for Telecommuting, etc.",99,,
567,0.97,3638.701,3642.205,"So, I think a lot of work is already in the hopper, and going successfully.",99,,
568,0.97,3642.205,3649.112,We just will keep with our March 13 date at this point.,99,,
569,0.97,3649.112,3650.713,"I will Distad, Councilmember.",100,,
570,0.97,3650.713,3655.618,To just add a little bit to Laurel's comments.,100,,
571,0.97,3655.618,3666.596,"As we have stated multiple times to the dynamic is, the situation is dynamic and we are reacting in real time.",100,,
572,0.97,3666.596,3684.414,"For instance, the new public health recommendations offered yesterday initiated Around-The- clock discussions by the executive with regard to new guidance that we were providing to our city workforce and supervisors and managers with regard to some of the provisions that you saw from our guidance earlier today.",100,,
573,0.97,3684.414,3697.493,"So, I think my short answer is, we will be pushing aggressively for folks to conclude their cognitive operations planning.",100,,
574,0.97,3697.493,3700.53,"But as with everything in this current situation, deadlines are shifting in real time.",100,,
575,0.97,3700.53,3701.064,Thank you.,101,,
576,0.97,3701.064,3702.965,This question really is to the Snapshot report.,101,,
577,0.97,3702.965,3717.48,"Out of the office of emergency management and the OEC operations from, and this is a Snapshot report from the third at 4:00.",101,,
578,0.97,3717.48,3727.89,There are a couple of issues related that have been identified as common concerns across all departments.,101,,
579,0.97,3727.89,3739.735,"One of those being, and I think they fall into OEM's Bailey, that's why I'm directing the question you.",101,,
580,0.97,3739.735,3741.337,Concerned about management and resources.,101,,
581,0.97,3741.337,3756.185,"And specifically, cleaning supplies, as well as having a common set of standards on policies for cleaning for each of the departments.",101,,
582,0.97,3756.185,3757.787,Can you talk a little bit about that?,101,,
583,0.97,3757.787,3758.187,Yeah.,102,,
584,0.97,3758.187,3763.893,Okay as you can imagine now in the community we are already seeing puerile and all kinds of products go off the shelves.,102,,
585,0.97,3763.893,3768.531,"In the emergency operations center, we have the Finance administration services representing our logistics section.",102,,
586,0.97,3768.531,3777.64,We are looking at how we centralized ordering of supplies . and those include those type of hygiene products and cleaning supplies.,102,,
587,0.97,3777.64,3793.856,"Fas is also been working in concert with human resources to address, how do we effectively retain the Cleanliness of our facilities if for any reason we have a sick employee or we have a positive Covid tested employee within the city.",102,,
588,0.97,3793.856,3805.868,"So, they are looking at the contracts and ensuring that we have got those types of service contracts in place to be able to do and support those missions.",102,,
589,0.97,3805.868,3812.241,"So just, this was identified by all of the departments is a concern.",103,,
590,0.97,3812.241,3816.279,A little less than two days ago.,103,,
591,0.97,3816.279,3818.047,Do we have enough cleaning products now?,103,,
592,0.97,3818.047,3820.149,"And, do we have a common set of standards for cleaning?",103,,
593,0.97,3820.149,3824.387,We have a common standard set of cleaning parameters.,104,,
594,0.97,3824.387,3828.591,I don't know about enough supplies.,104,,
595,0.97,3828.591,3836.532,"They have been doing inventory, as well as trying to centralized all the orders that we have from the different departments.",104,,
596,0.97,3836.532,3843.005,I can't tell you off the top of my head what we have for actual quantities at this point.,104,,
597,0.97,3843.005,3854.05,"And Councilmember Herbold, I will Distad, in some ways this may be a perfect Segue into chief Scoggins and some of the first Responder aspects of this.",105,,
598,0.97,3854.05,3882.511,"But, I think what we will hear throughout this conversation is that, in terms of supplies, whether it be cleaning products or for our own city facilities, also personal protective equipment and other things for our first responders are part of the global discussion that we are looking at and frankly, these are Dynamics that every jurisdiction across the country are dealing with.",105,,
599,0.97,3882.511,3888.618,There is going to need to be some support for the Federal and state level with regards to some of these aspects that chief Scoggins can speak to as well.,105,,
600,0.97,3888.618,3890.953,"So, we can get into some of that here.",105,,
601,0.97,3890.953,3894.49,And I just wanted because this is something that is listed under all departmental concerns.,106,,
602,0.97,3894.49,3899.362,I totally appreciate the unique concerns of our first responders.,106,,
603,0.97,3899.362,3917.847,"And director goings I know is working on this very specific question right now as we actually are exploring the conversation very actively and the EEOC about centralizing person purchasing functions, get a little more coordination and a real-time understanding of the precise question you're asking about.",107,,
604,0.97,3917.847,3921.55,"Before we move on to G Scoggins, just a quick question if I may.",108,,
605,0.97,3921.55,3938.768,"When we look at the number of supplies that we either need or are currently lacking, I understand you may want to get back to us with that type of data, can we also ask those who are using the cleaning supplies in our buildings that they have the supplies that they need?",108,,
606,0.97,3938.768,3951.013,"When I was walking and I saw folks who are cleaning our floor yesterday I asked, do you feel like you have everything you need and it was sort of this deer in the headlights look . I think people don't know what they necessarily need.",108,,
607,0.97,3951.013,3953.416,I am concerned about those who are cleaning our buildings.,108,,
608,0.97,3953.416,3961.924,"We know it is not airborne, but given the type of work they do with potentially water splashing and other things, I think it would be helpful for them to have masks.",108,,
609,0.97,3961.924,3971.434,"I am not a Healthcare expert, but just asking our public health officers if they think that those that are doing the cleaning also need that type of supplies would be helpful.",108,,
610,0.97,3971.434,3979.175,"Then, Councilmember Herbold may have asked about this, but can I ask you a little bit more directly?",108,,
611,0.97,3979.175,3985.514,Is there anything that the city can do in partnership with the Attorney General to address the price gouging of cleaning supplies for the public?,108,,
612,0.97,3985.514,3990.92,Anything that we know of that we have been called on to help with?,108,,
613,0.97,3990.92,3994.623,"Councilmember, that is a great question we Wolflike that is something for our team to discuss.",109,,
614,0.97,3994.623,4002.765,"If there's something specific, we will engage you on it.",109,,
615,0.97,4002.765,4012.475,"If it's okay, we can move on, I do think chief Scoggins has some important information to share with regards to our, the work of our first responders and perhaps we can flag a few questions have come up that you might address as well.",109,,
616,0.97,4012.475,4013.075,Sure.,110,,
617,0.97,4013.075,4014.577,"So, good afternoon members of the Council.",110,,
618,0.97,4014.577,4021.65,Will give you an overview from the first Responder perspective.,110,,
619,0.97,4021.65,4024.487,"As always, I think it is important to start off with thank Youse.",110,,
620,0.97,4024.487,4027.957,There is a lot of thank Youse to our public health partners.,110,,
621,0.97,4027.957,4041.237,"Been engaged in many phone calls and conversations to make sure that we are doing the right thing as we serve community, our King County EMS director, Michelle - Arcing County medical director Dr. Tom Ray, as well as our own medical director, Dr. Michael Sayer.",110,,
622,0.97,4041.237,4048.878,They have been providing the oversight and guidance that we need to make the decisions for our responders out in the field.,110,,
623,0.97,4048.878,4050.813,"And most of all, thank you to our first responders.",110,,
624,0.97,4050.813,4052.314,Not just Seattle but all over King County.,110,,
625,0.97,4052.314,4061.891,"Many of you heard that three agencies in King County, Kirkland, Woodville and Redman have firefighters under quarantine because of an exposure.",110,,
626,0.97,4061.891,4074.67,"That just goes to show that responding . Ders do not stop they continue to go and sometimes you can't see what is going to get you from time to time, but you still go and try to serve community.",110,,
627,0.97,4074.67,4086.649,"On the pandemic plan, we are in stage III of our Sfd active disease plan and I will be talking through what that exactly means for the Seattle fire Department.",110,,
628,0.97,4086.649,4091.72,Because it assists us in our planning and coordination.,110,,
629,0.97,4091.72,4114.877,"Another thing you should know, as of this past Sunday, we have stood out daily conference calls with all of Arcing County fire partners and Chiefs around the county to make sure we are moving in one direction together under the guidance of her medical direction and our EMS director to make sure that we are serving all of the members of the county, and I've got to thank all of - throughout the county.",110,,
630,0.97,4114.877,4132.261,"All of the fire Chiefs who are truly engaged in trying to make sure that if Kirkland has 25% of their workforce under quarantine, can that city still get the services they need delivered?",110,,
631,0.97,4132.261,4134.797,And we are circling up to try to make sure that happens.,110,,
632,0.97,4134.797,4139.668,"You know, one of the first steps in our pandemic plan is to make sure we review all of our training procedures throughout the Department.",110,,
633,0.97,4139.668,4150.679,"And we have a real-time team that has been doing that, modifying that, changing that and this week, we have started rolling out a train the Trainer and moving to the entire organization.",110,,
634,0.97,4150.679,4165.694,"Even though we have had this training many times, we are doing an active touch on every firefighter in the organization to make sure they are Retrained on our policies, procedures and donning and doffing all of the Ppe's they need out in the field.",110,,
635,0.97,4165.694,4170.933,"Earlier this week, the Seattle release Department participated in the training with us.",110,,
636,0.97,4170.933,4175.004,"The train the Trainer, so they can also engage in training their people.",110,,
637,0.97,4175.004,4176.338,That is important for us.,110,,
638,0.97,4176.338,4182.411,The impact for us could be very real.,110,,
639,0.97,4182.411,4192.188,"Just to give you some Stats on what this looks like for us, about 12-1300 calls per week Woodfall kind of under this umbrella that could be this type of response.",110,,
640,0.97,4192.188,4196.926,About 100-130 calls per week are respiratory related.,110,,
641,0.97,4196.926,4203.265,And that is per week.,110,,
642,0.97,4203.265,4206.168,50-200 calls per week that could fall under this umbrella.,110,,
643,0.97,4206.168,4213.175,"So, that becomes very important for us we paying attention to it.",110,,
644,0.97,4213.175,4217.846,"Since we have been monitoring this since the middle of January, we have sent out 4 communications to the Seattle fire Department.",110,,
645,0.97,4217.846,4229.425,On progress and changes that we have been making.,110,,
646,0.97,4233.829,4235.564,We have modified our dispatch procedures three times now.,110,,
647,0.97,4235.564,4239.468,There are medical direction to make sure we are asking additional questions and that becomes very important for us.,110,,
648,0.97,4239.468,4246.342,"When that call comes into the 911 center, we want to try to equip the firefighters with as much information as possible, so, they don't walk in blind to what they could be facing.",110,,
649,0.97,4246.342,4249.244,"So, we have continued to expand that and we have not done that alone.",110,,
650,0.97,4249.244,4256.719,"We have done that a partnership with nor calm, which dispatches for the North and the Eastern agencies and Valley calm which dispatches for the Southern and Eastern agencies in King County, along with Seattle fire dispatch.",110,,
651,0.97,4256.719,4264.426,"Just yesterday, the team got together, had another meeting with her medical directors, and we pushed out another change as early as this morning.",110,,
652,0.97,4264.426,4270.332,That is very important for us to try to equip our people with the right information.,110,,
653,0.97,4270.332,4276.572,We have given our crews a direction on what to do when they arrive on scene and different things are taking place.,110,,
654,0.97,4276.572,4278.34,"Because, we could Miss one along the way.",110,,
655,0.97,4278.34,4283.946,"We could not get correct information, which happens quite often.",110,,
656,0.97,4283.946,4288.55,"So, we needed to have a game plan for that for our crews to make adjustments on the fly, out in the field.",110,,
657,0.97,4288.55,4300.462,"We need to have a plan that if our public safety partners in PD, if they are walking into something, we need to be able to pause them from walking into it.",110,,
658,0.97,4300.462,4304.033,"Hopefully, equip them with what they need so they are safe and they are protected.",110,,
659,0.97,4304.033,4304.833,That becomes very important.,110,,
660,0.97,4304.833,4310.939,We have given guidance on transporting patients.,110,,
661,0.97,4310.939,4311.974,And thank you to the public.,110,,
662,0.97,4311.974,4312.741,I should say that.,110,,
663,0.97,4312.741,4317.379,"We have been following the public health guidance, and we have been Broadcasting a lot.",110,,
664,0.97,4317.379,4321.684,"If you have a fever or cold, please do not use the 911 system for that.",110,,
665,0.97,4321.684,4323.686,That is not what a 911 system is built for.,110,,
666,0.97,4323.686,4328.19,The 911 system is built for those dramatic emergencies that Úwe face.,110,,
667,0.97,4328.19,4336.098,"Cardiac events, strokes, all those type of things that we deal with on a daily basis, but not for the cold and the flu type scenario.",110,,
668,0.97,4336.098,4341.904,"And what we have seen is, we have been tracking our calls over the last eight weeks and they have not spiked.",110,,
669,0.97,4341.904,4347.776,"So, thank you to community for paying attention.",110,,
670,0.97,4347.776,4366.528,"But for those patients that we do respond to, and they - [no Audio]",110,,
671,0.97,4366.528,4374.837,"Signs and symptoms, what we do is we put a call in a head to the hospital that we are going to so they are prepared to receive the patient, so they have as much information as possible.",111,,
672,0.97,4374.837,4376.238,So they can provide that care.,111,,
673,0.97,4376.238,4382.111,We provided direction on Decontamination of crews and equipment.,111,,
674,0.97,4382.111,4387.149,That is something that is very important to us since we are dealing with the public on many times a day and there's a process.,111,,
675,0.97,4387.149,4394.123,Cdc ducts give guidance on Decontamination procedure that we are following.,111,,
676,0.97,4394.123,4396.458,Cdc's guidance.,111,,
677,0.97,4396.458,4402.965,"Weather we are Dekoninck equipment, vehicles, uniforms, or any of those things, we are following the best practices that are out there.",111,,
678,0.97,4402.965,4403.732,And then exposure concerns.,111,,
679,0.97,4403.732,4407.302,We are having open and honest conversations with our personnel.,111,,
680,0.97,4407.302,4412.207,Today will be day 4 of our Departmentwide meetings.,111,,
681,0.97,4412.207,4421.383,"We have Skype and we are allowing our personnel to ask questions directly to our medical director, to myself, and other members of my leadership team.",111,,
682,0.97,4421.383,4423.852,So they are well informed on all the things they need to do.,111,,
683,0.97,4423.852,4426.255,We have also been tracking our inventories.,111,,
684,0.97,4426.255,4431.36,That is important for us I spoke to some of the numbers.,111,,
685,0.97,4431.36,4441.703,"If we responded to 200 of these type of incidents per week, we have supplies for four weeks of full outfitted Ppe firefighters responding out in the field.",111,,
686,0.97,4441.703,4446.008,But we probably won't be responding to 200 per week.,111,,
687,0.97,4446.008,4451.48,"We have stretched that out to six weeks or eight weeks, based on what the probabilities are.",111,,
688,0.97,4451.48,4453.315,"So, supplies are very important for us.",111,,
689,0.97,4453.315,4469.731,"I know we as well as the police Department, we have a lot of orders out out there because our goal now is to Backfill all those supplies, so, we don't know how long this is going to go on.",111,,
690,0.97,4469.731,4472.434,And we just want to be prepared as we continue to move forward.,111,,
691,0.97,4472.434,4474.837,That is all I have unless you have any questions for me.,111,,
692,0.97,4474.837,4476.038,Thank you so very much.,112,,
693,0.97,4476.038,4487.049,"I know that some of our colleagues at the table do have a hard stop at 2:30, so we want to get some of the questions around how we are serving a lot of the vulnerable folks that you see everyday, chief.",112,,
694,0.97,4487.049,4488.25,"So, thank you for that summary.",112,,
695,0.97,4488.25,4490.052,Is there any question for the chief?,112,,
696,0.97,4490.052,4494.323,Councilmember Herbold.,112,,
697,0.97,4494.323,4498.76,One of the questions I wanted to advance was testing on first responders is being Prioritized.,113,,
698,0.97,4498.76,4506.735,"The response we received is that yes, priority of test is determined by the Washington State Department of health in consultation with the centers with these can disease control.",113,,
699,0.97,4506.735,4508.337,And it refers to an earlier answer.,113,,
700,0.97,4508.337,4530.893,"But I don't, that answer didn't quite get for me, give to me the answer that I was seeking about, given the testing protocols, how, we make sure that first responders are going to the top of the list.",113,,
701,0.97,4530.893,4574.736,"Given the testing protocols that already exist, and then, just a question I have is, whether or not it makes sense to advocate to the CDC for a change in testing protocols as it relates to 1ST responders . I am a little worried that people have to be symptomatic in order to, and get the referral from public health provider in order to get tested particularly when it comes to our first responders and considering that people are Asymptomatic typically for I think, I have heard a week.",113,,
702,0.97,4574.736,4587.282,"So, that is another, I know we don't control that because these are protocols that are set by the CDC, but whether or not we should be advocating for different ones for our first responders.",113,,
703,0.97,4587.282,4589.017,Thanks for the question chapter member Herbold.,114,,
704,0.97,4589.017,4590.319,That's a two-part question.,114,,
705,0.97,4590.319,4595.324,Will be advocate heavily if any of our people are exposed?,114,,
706,0.97,4595.324,4595.657,Absolutely.,114,,
707,0.97,4595.657,4601.363,"We have the resources to do that, and I think we know the right places to go.",114,,
708,0.97,4601.363,4603.565,Our goal is to take care of our people.,114,,
709,0.97,4603.565,4606.268,"On the Asymptomatic bees, you know, there is a caution there.",114,,
710,0.97,4606.268,4607.869,We don't want to provide a false positive.,114,,
711,0.97,4607.869,4619.147,"We don't want a person to get a test too soon and it gives a false positive result, and they think they are okay and a week later they start showing signs and symptoms and then they have to go take another test and then that one shows positive.",114,,
712,0.97,4619.147,4629.791,"So, it is very important the order of the test and when we get the test.",114,,
713,0.97,4629.791,4633.095,Enough of the virus has to be in your system for the test to actually be accurate.,114,,
714,0.97,4633.095,4641.603,"And if we test too soon, it could give a person a sense of also, and then they get sick a week later and then they have been released around their family, around their friends, back working, back serving community.",114,,
715,0.97,4641.603,4645.207,"And then, we can have a domino effect for something like that actually taking place.",114,,
716,0.97,4645.207,4646.141,Thank you.,115,,
717,0.97,4646.141,4650.278,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,116,,
718,0.97,4650.278,4651.913,"Callings, any additional questions for the chief?",116,,
719,0.97,4651.913,4652.914,Great.,116,,
720,0.97,4652.914,4653.148,Mare -,116,,
721,0.97,4653.148,4674.336,"Next up, I will just comment that when we initiated the conversation with the Council multiple Councilmembers raised one of the first issues that you have made a priority, was our work with regard to communicating and engaging with vulnerable populations.",117,,
722,0.97,4674.336,4682.077,"Refugee immigrant communities, not English speaking commuters, and the Mayor shares her Prioritization Prioritization without regard.",117,,
723,0.97,4682.077,4684.246,We have a team working in that space for some time.,117,,
724,0.97,4684.246,4699.761,Wanted to provide an opportunity to share with you some of the work in that space and we will close with work that deputy Mayor six killer and deputy Johnson have been working on specifically related to the homeless population.,117,,
725,0.97,4699.761,4703.565,"So, with that, I will turn it over to folks to talk a little bit about the outreach efforts.",117,,
726,0.97,4703.565,4703.965,Right.,118,,
727,0.97,4703.965,4705.333,Thank you Mayor Fong.,118,,
728,0.97,4705.333,4735.864,"From the Department neighborhoods, we have served as a lead is a outreach with Oed who is engaging with the small businesses and employers as well as through IRA, who is the center for language access plan . We are engaging with 14 specific non-English community liaisons to supplement the work at the guidance of King County public health, to extend their outreach and focus with Non- English populations specifically with senior populations.",118,,
729,0.97,4735.864,4751.113,"In the, the goal here is to extend already translated materials and provide interpretation of those materials in connection with sing senior groups . can County public health.",118,,
730,0.97,4751.113,4764.526,"We are also working on regular call schedule with the multiple organizations, Community-Based organizations, nonprofit partners and business organizations to provide timely information and guidance.",118,,
731,0.97,4764.526,4774.236,"Again, in partnership with King County public health, as well as tracking community events of all shapes and sizes so that we are accurately communicating that to community.",118,,
732,0.97,4774.236,4778.507,I will turn it over quickly to Bobby Lee.,118,,
733,0.97,4778.507,4778.907,Could deal.,119,,
734,0.97,4778.907,4780.609,I will keep my comments short.,119,,
735,0.97,4780.609,4781.943,And if you have questions I can dive in.,119,,
736,0.97,4781.943,4787.449,The business community is pretty diverse.,119,,
737,0.97,4787.449,4790.318,There is a different universe within the business community that we are interacting with.,119,,
738,0.97,4790.318,4794.256,This morning with a hospitality industry certainly has been a disaster situation for them.,119,,
739,0.97,4794.256,4808.77,"But in general, they do feel very concerned about how this is being played out, and they are, I think moving much faster in some ways than perhaps the public sector in trying to address is.",119,,
740,0.97,4808.77,4810.772,And we will see this played out more often.,119,,
741,0.97,4810.772,4818.079,"The feedback that we are getting from small businesses and medium-size businesses is really around access to capital, to have enough reserve to get through this.",119,,
742,0.97,4818.079,4827.455,"The average small business, which would be small business to find us 50 employees or less.",119,,
743,0.97,4827.455,4831.293,Their monthly rent is about $9000 a month.,119,,
744,0.97,4831.293,4841.469,"So, that gives you a reference point in terms of some of the costs they incur when they close.",119,,
745,0.97,4841.469,4845.273,"So, we are trying to find ways to provide more relief in terms of licensing and tax potentially.",119,,
746,0.97,4845.273,4859.754,"But also, at the same time, look at Federal funding that Congress has passed, the $8.3 billion package on this issue that we are tracking that as well.",119,,
747,0.97,4859.754,4873.902,"One of the areas we get immediately, potentially move forward is a dislocated workers - people who are laid off from the situations of the employees can access training . The average cost for training is around $10,000 per employee on average.",119,,
748,0.97,4873.902,4883.945,We have directed my staff and development Council workforce development Council to start moving money toward the dislocated workers program.,119,,
749,0.97,4883.945,4893.655,That is some of the things we will be working right away to address a potential unemployment rise in the near future.,119,,
750,0.97,4893.655,4901.029,"We are also conducting extensive economic impact Úanalysis, and we have done Som preliminary ones to discuss today.",119,,
751,0.97,4901.029,4902.564,We will be happy to discuss it today.,119,,
752,0.97,4902.564,4904.232,I will leave it at that level for now.,119,,
753,0.97,4904.232,4905.066,Any questions or?,120,,
754,0.97,4905.066,4909.671,"Before you move on, I want to just make sure I understood what you said.",121,,
755,0.97,4909.671,4920.882,You believe that some of the Federal relief dollars might be available to address shortfalls that small businesses are experiencing?,121,,
756,0.97,4920.882,4931.259,"As I understand it, the under the $8.3 billion 1 billion is set aside for small businesses.",122,,
757,0.97,4931.259,4935.864,"Depending on how this gets played out, it could be alone, or maybe potentially even grants.",122,,
758,0.97,4935.864,4940.368,But we are not really clear on that yet.,122,,
759,0.97,4940.368,4947.008,"But the challenging part, and the Mayor explained this morning, is the ability to get the money to the local folks quickly is the issue.",122,,
760,0.97,4947.008,4957.285,"The time, the ability to move fast in A. what we are going to do is Reallocate our existing Federal dollars from her workforce development.",122,,
761,0.97,4957.285,4964.559,"Meanwhile, is much relief on the taxes and fees and licensing.",122,,
762,0.97,4964.559,4972.434,While we also try to convince the Federal side to move quickly on that $1 billion for the small businesses.,122,,
763,0.97,4972.434,4972.701,Okay.,123,,
764,0.97,4972.701,4976.204,"Yeah, I just received a message from a small business owner in West Seattle.",123,,

854,0.97,5722.183,5725.853,"And then Finally, at the human services Department is acting as a central Hub for information from providers.",133,,
855,0.97,5725.853,5736.897,We want to know and have asked providers to be in contact with us immediately if they are going to change any of the services.,133,,
856,0.97,5736.897,5744.772,"So, if they are going to reduce hours, if they are going to limit the number of people who can maybe access the facilities.",133,,
857,0.97,5744.772,5746.907,"If they have any reductions in staffing, etc.",133,,

863,0.97,5791.952,5801.862,Both through the Seattle EEOC as well as King County EEOC to purchase the materials that we need in order to make the supplies available to providers so that they can adhere to the hygiene and sanitation guidelines.,134,,
864,0.97,5801.862,5811.972,We also want - Outreaches still occurring for a population living on shelter.,134,,
865,0.97,5811.972,5823.984,"And we want to make sure that we are not only pointing people in the direction of services that they need, but that we are distributing hygiene kits for individuals who are living on shelter.",134,,

868,0.97,5846.707,5855.282,The third piece that really has had our full focus and attention has to do with aging and disabled population.,135,,

871,0.97,5885.98,5897.324,It has been a big body of work over the last few days . We want to ensure that continuity of services occurs.,135,,
872,0.97,5897.324,5905.666,Many of these individuals that we are serving our homebound and cannot access what they need without relying on individuals to visit their home.,135,,
873,0.97,5905.666,5920.881,"So, it is really important for us, both as the provider of the service, but also as the contracted partner funding these services . We want to make sure that people are adhering to public health standards as they engage with individuals in their home.",135,,
874,0.97,5920.881,5934.862,"Finally, I just wanted to flag that we are very aware of the risks for an aging population as they congregate in senior centers and - sites.",136,,
875,0.97,5934.862,5962.156,"We have also yesterday finalized some assessing of all of the senior centers and senior Congregant meal sites that exist across the city and County, so that we can begin communication with them, pushing out the same level of information that we have been for shelter providers to them, so that they are practicing the safety measures that we want in place.",136,,
876,0.97,5962.156,5990.317,"But also, we want to understand, what kind of shifts to programming they are making, given yesterday's new guidance from public health . So, we really want to understand if there is any changes, if they are encouraging individuals to not use senior centers and Congregant meals?",136,,
877,0.97,5990.317,6006.967,"And, we are doing some background planning to ensure that if Congregant meals sites should close or reduce hours, or reduce, have any reduction in the number of people that they can serve, that we are ready to lean in and offer meal delivery services instead.",136,,
878,0.97,6006.967,6021.248,"So, with that, maybe I will pause, given time, I know that counsel has received several answers to many of your specific questions . But, maybe I can pause there and see if there are any questions.",137,,

884,0.97,6045.806,6054.782,"Director Johnson, we heard about a 40% reduction in some of the Kirkland workforce population that was mentioned earlier in the presentation.",138,,
885,0.97,6054.782,6068.929,"Do we have a sense from our direct service providers working in the human services - sorry, the contracted entities without human services Department, if they have experienced any significant reductions in the workforce from folks staying home yet?",138,,
886,0.97,6068.929,6069.196,Yes.,139,,
887,0.97,6069.196,6075.302,That's the kind of information we are asking to be provided to the Department.,139,,
888,0.97,6075.302,6078.205,"At this point, we are not getting information about their workforce.",139,,
889,0.97,6078.205,6087.948,As far as reductions or having a spike in people calling in sick and not wanting to be in service to the community in their normal capacity.,139,,
890,0.97,6087.948,6100.027,"In fact, yesterday, I spoke with Danny Malone, executive director Dsc, and he affirmed that people are showing up to work.",139,,
891,0.97,6100.027,6113.707,"People are you know, want to be engaged and understand the Vulnerabilities that this specific population have.",139,,
892,0.97,6113.707,6116.877,But he has not seen any kind of workforce reductions at this point.,139,,
893,0.97,6116.877,6117.878,Okay.,140,,
894,0.97,6117.878,6118.946,Councilmember Herbold.,140,,

896,0.97,6119.346,6119.947,Three quick questions.,141,,
897,0.97,6119.947,6142.069,First I would love just to know how many hygiene kits the navigation team has been able to distribute . Thus far I understand that there is a need for more . It would be helpful to know how many have already been distributed and over what period of time?,141,,
898,0.97,6142.069,6146.974,"Also, in the questions, the answers you provided to our earlier questions, you make NOTE and you said so in your presentation today.",141,,
899,0.97,6146.974,6169.129,That you are contacting our contracted service providers to help them make assessments around public health for their operations . one of the items that is mentioned is that you are recommending that they deploy hygiene and sanitation recommendations as well.,141,,
900,0.97,6169.129,6185.179,"I would love to know, beyond urging them to employ this recommendation for hygiene and sanitation, I would like to know what role the city is playing, if we are providing any actual, physical, monetary assistance.",141,,
901,0.97,6185.179,6211.672,"And Lastly, I have talked already about my concern that the ability to be tested is bounded by a professional Healthcare recommendation . and I am just, so, to me, what that means is, largely, it is going to be people who have providers, contacting the providers, and being able to get testing.",141,,
902,0.97,6211.672,6237.497,"I am wondering whether or not public health nurses who are going out into the field where people who live on sheltered are . organizations like Healthcare for the homeless, do those individuals have the authority, if they find people who are symptomatic, are they considered a Healthcare professional as - criteria for testing?",141,,

1059,0.97,7554.613,7556.348,"Kittle Freeman, counsel central staff.",172,,
1060,0.97,7556.348,7582.608,"So, as the counsel knows, on March 3, the director proclaimed a civil emergency related to the spread of Covid- 19 otherwise known as novel Coronavirus . that proclamation includes orders that allow the Mayor to assume authority to bypass existing laws, regulations and policies in the interest of protecting the public health, safety and welfare.",172,,
1061,0.97,7582.608,7601.627,"The laws and regulations that the Mayor could bypass are primarily related to budget, contracting, purchasing, and regulation of land use and construction, including the city's application of the state environmental policy act.",172,,
1062,0.97,7601.627,7622.281,"Pursuant to chapter 1002 in the Seattle municipal code, when the Mayor proclaims a civil emergency and issues orders pursuant to that emergency, within 48 hours the Council may by resolution ratify and confirm the Mayor's action, modify the Mayor's action, or reject the Mayor's action . Councilmember Mosqueda proposes to modify the Mayor's proposed action.",172,,
1063,0.97,7622.281,7626.852,I will walk through how resolution 31739 would do that.,172,,
1064,0.97,7626.852,7638.764,"So, turning to that resolution, and the modified proclamation.",172,,
1065,0.97,7638.764,7640.966,"When there is a civil emergency, the counsel seeds power.",172,,
1066,0.97,7640.966,7644.103,"So, it is necessarily a trust, but verify exercise for the counsel.",172,,
1067,0.97,7644.103,7648.741,And that is reflected in the proposed substitute resolution and proclamation.,172,,
1068,0.97,7648.741,7655.014,I will talk through a little bit of the mechanics of the legislation here.,172,,
1069,0.97,7655.014,7680.606,"The proclamation and orders of the proclamation establish the civil emergency and Enumerate those powers the Mayor is assuming . the assumption of power allows her to bypass, as I mentioned, otherwise applicable laws and regulations . The counsel can limit her assumption of power by modifying the proclamation in Úorder, but the counsel cannot prescribe that she take actions that would otherwise be at her discretion.",172,,
1070,0.97,7680.606,7694.887,"For that, the counsel can establish expectations so that the Mayor understands what sort of information the counsel needs to act on future orders, and also to continue the civil emergency.",172,,
1071,0.97,7694.887,7703.929,"So, I will turn here to proposed modifications to the proclamation.",172,,
1072,0.97,7703.929,7711.87,"So, the modifications to the proclamation, in many ways, Clarifications.",173,,
1073,0.97,7711.87,7718.043,"But also, some restrictions on some powers the Mayor proposes to invoke.",173,,
1074,0.97,7718.043,7740.766,Turning here to page 2 of the Mayor's proclamation of the counsel clarifies that the authority that she is assuming is limited to state budget laws . striking reference to Rcw and the adopted city budget.,173,,
1075,0.97,7740.766,7753.212,Substitute proposed by Councilmember a Skater CONFIRMS that the Mayor will comply with state of emergency reporting requirements - contracting.,173,,
1076,0.97,7753.212,7769.595,It affirms that future orders will comply with formal requirements that are prescribed by the Seattle municipal code that are largely intended to protect civil rights and help the Council understand her future orders might infringe civil rights.,173,,
1077,0.97,7769.595,7773.065,Clarifies that the delegation Úof authority to the police and fire Chiefs is pursuant to current law.,173,,
1078,0.97,7773.065,7774.633,Unless authorized by a future order.,173,,
1079,0.97,7774.633,7789.014,"It also strikes reference in the delegation section of the order to, other departments and personnel will assist as requested.",173,,
1080,0.97,7789.014,7797.823,The order delegates to the fire chief and police chief authority to implement certain laws which they already have the authority to do.,173,,
1081,0.97,7797.823,7801.426,But it strikes a surplus - the language about other departments and personnel.,173,,
1082,0.97,7801.426,7816.542,"The, it eliminates what is largely a boilerplate reference to a charter provision that Recites that the Mayor has sole authority over the police departments in times of emergency, which is true in all circumstances.",174,,
1083,0.97,7816.542,7820.913,"So, questions, Councilmember's?",175,,
1084,0.97,7820.913,7826.518,"Kittle, thank you very much for walking us through the Edits to the proclamation.",176,,
1085,0.97,7826.518,7830.622,Would it be helpful if we took questions on that if there are any at this point?,176,,
1086,0.97,7830.622,7831.557,Before moving onto the resolution?,176,,
1087,0.97,7831.557,7839.264,"Counsel colleagues, any questions on the amended proclamation that we have in front of us for consideration?",177,,
1088,0.97,7839.264,7840.299,Comments?,178,,
1089,0.97,7840.299,7840.632,Questions.,179,,
1090,0.97,7840.632,7847.639,We can do comments if you like.,180,,
1091,0.97,7847.639,7853.445,Or if you wanted him to go to both of them and that as a package we could consider comments if that would be appropriate.,180,,
1092,0.97,7853.445,7854.413,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,180,,
1093,0.97,7854.413,7854.813,"Questions, yes.",180,,
1094,0.97,7854.813,7876.702,"I just wanted to, four, folks who may be following along, I was hoping that Kittle Freeman could offer just a little more clarity, the difference between the language that was proposed as it relates to the powers being granted the Mayor, related to the budget.",181,,
1095,0.97,7876.702,7882.608,"And, what the counsel is offering as new language.",181,,
1096,0.97,7882.608,7890.082,I think it is fair to say that this is more a clarification.,181,,
1097,0.97,7890.082,7901.894,"But I think if people were to just read it without more, more understanding, it might seem like we are putting some limits that I don't think we intend to put.",181,,
1098,0.97,7901.894,7902.227,Sure.,182,,
1099,0.97,7902.227,7912.471,"So, section 3 of the proclamation lists limitations that the Mayor is assuming authority to bypass.",182,,
1100,0.97,7912.471,7921.88,"And, those limitations include limitations that are present in our contracting requirements and other state and local requirements.",182,,
1101,0.97,7921.88,7934.76,"From what I understand, there is ambiguity in state law about what authority the Mayor or mayors may have, depending on what type of jurisdiction it is in the States of emergency.",182,,
1102,0.97,7934.76,7938.43,"So, this resolves that ambiguity in part by pointing to general allegedly.",182,,
1103,0.97,7938.43,7941.366,Thank you.,183,,
1104,0.97,7941.366,7943.669,Thank you very much.,184,,
1105,0.97,7943.669,7949.875,Any additional questions on the Mayoral proclamation of the suggested Edits?,184,,
1106,0.97,7949.875,7956.315,"Seeing none, Quito, do you mind walking us through the resolution that would accompany this?",184,,
1107,0.97,7956.315,7957.149,Sure.,185,,
1108,0.97,7957.149,7966.525,"As I mentioned, I counsel decision on a Mayoral proclamation of a civil emergency is a trust but verify exercise.",185,,
1109,0.97,7966.525,7983.875,"So, the limitations on the Mayor's exercise of emergency authority in the proclamation, the expectations that the counsel has for how she will use her authority and how the city will act as this emergency evolves are contained in the body of the resolution.",185,,
1110,0.97,7983.875,7989.981,"So, I will walk through each section of the resolution . of the proposed substitute resolution.",185,,
1111,0.97,7989.981,8011.87,The first section modifies the proclamation as I just described . The second section requests that the Mayor make expenditures pursuant to her emergency authority that are consistent with counsel priorities.,185,,
1112,0.97,8011.87,8018.243,"And those priorities include investments in Handwashing stations, investment hygiene services, and as you all recall, the counsel made some appropriations for mobile Pitstops as part of the 2020 adopted budget.",185,,
1113,0.97,8018.243,8031.823,Investments that increase the access for households to cover 19 testings and linguistically appropriate materials for limited English proficiency speakers.,185,,
1114,0.97,8031.823,8035.927,Continue please.,186,,
1115,0.97,8035.927,8054.98,"So, moving on to section 3 of the proposed substitute resolution, this section establishes the counsel's expectation for additional actions that the Mayor may take to address the spread of Covid- 19.",186,,
1116,0.97,8054.98,8063.989,- the city personnel policies and collective bargaining agreements to clarify working conditions for city employees.,186,,

1118,0.97,8082.607,8093.618,And her recommendation to counsel on how the state of emergency is Impacting the homeless communities.,186,,
1119,0.97,8093.618,8096.221,"Finally, potentially issuance of an order, not friendly, but the two remaining things.",186,,
1120,0.97,8096.221,8099.091,What is the issuance of an order related economic controls and price stabilization.,186,,
1121,0.97,8099.091,8101.726,This is something the deputy Mayor related to in his presentation to the Council.,186,,
1122,0.97,8101.726,8111.269,"Finally, identification that the city can take to encourage better working conditions and his courage, for Non-City employees,",186,,
1123,0.97,8111.269,8111.903,"All right, Kittle.",187,,
1124,0.97,8111.903,8114.139,It just trailed off a little there at the end.,187,,
1125,0.97,8114.139,8115.54,Can you say that last part again?,187,,
1126,0.97,8115.54,8126.618,Sub session f of section 3 addresses steps that the city can take to encourage Non-City employees to provide safe working conditions for their employees during the civil emergency.,188,,
1127,0.97,8126.618,8139.931,And also it discourages actions one can take to discourage private-sector employees from taking punitive actions against employees who don't come to work for public health reasons.,188,,
1128,0.97,8139.931,8141.867,"Section 4, part of me,",188,,
1129,0.97,8141.867,8155.78,"Thank you, I just want to speak to two items under section 3. the first being, the language related to Telecommuting.",189,,
1130,0.97,8155.78,8208.333,"I recognize that we are giving direction to employees here in the city and the county is also giving direction to employees in the county about Telecommuting, and that heather has been concern from labor representing our employees that we really need to have our policies around Telecommuting be aligned . So, this is an effort to get at that need . I think the directive that came out of the Mayor's office around Telecommuting might have inadvertently created some confusion . We compared to the directive coming out of King County, related to Telecommuting.",189,,
1131,0.97,8208.333,8210.001,And this is intended to address that issue.,189,,
1132,0.97,8210.001,8241.933,As it relates specifically to the items listed under section f . I would like to signal my interest in working with the chair of the labor Committee in potentially having a future action . a resolution in the hopefully very near future because this is all related to this potential pandemic . as it relates specifically to what we would really like to see.,189,,

1143,0.97,8307.699,8308.299,Any questions?,193,,
1144,0.97,8308.299,8308.6,All right.,193,,

1147,0.97,8329.287,8334.526,That reporting is required after the state of emergency.,193,,
1148,0.97,8334.526,8339.564,"So, these are reporting requirements that would apply during the state of emergency with the first report submitted to the Council by March 20.",193,,
1149,0.97,8339.564,8341.866,Reports would include information on emergency expenditures by Department.,193,,

I really appreciate the efforts of the executive as well to work through some of these amendments with us.",207,,
1188,0.97,8571.362,8647.138,"And I want to speak specifically to the items in the resolution in sections 2 - D. we are, with the proclamation, agreeing with the use of the Mayor's power to expedite the purchase of items that are critical to addressing the spread of the virus and limiting the spread of the virus, which is really an important Mission-Critical objective . and I just, as it relates to the fact that we are eliminating the requirement for the Mayor to have to go through some of the contracting and procurement practices, advertising practices that normally they would have to, I would also encourage, when it comes to purchases that, they are making some policy work that has to be done in order to implement the use of those purchases . I want to make sure that we are doing those things together moving forward.",207,,
1189,0.97,8647.138,8669.46,"I am concerned that as it relates specifically to the mobile Pitstops, that there, there appears to be a belief on the part of the executive that we have to work out all the policy decision-making around the siding and location and staffing of the mobile Pitstops before we begin procurement Tech and I think we can do those things together.",207,,

1201,0.97,8751.943,8761.285,"And, it says that the public health goals of the Mayor's proclamation should be carried out with the least restrictions on civil liberties and consistent with public-health evidence.",209,,
1202,0.97,8761.285,8799.624,"- I just want to make a special mention of the fact that the city council expects that, as a specific example, of the treatment of homeless neighbors, that the public held goals are home health assistance is the goal, and not policing of, or in any other way, violating the rights of homeless individuals.",209,,
1203,0.97,8799.624,8803.427,"I think it is very important to point out, because our homeless neighbors are also the most vulnerable, Healthwise.",209,,
1204,0.97,8803.427,8812.203,"And a weakened immune system and we have to make sure as the Council has done throughout the day, that we do that with a reasonable social responsibility and was zero stigma.",209,,
1205,0.97,8812.203,8816.741,I think it's very important.,209,,
1206,0.97,8816.741,8825.116,"As many of you are aware, of course, the problems we face are obviously the most emerging problem is related to the pandemic.",209,,
1207,0.97,8825.116,8833.357,But the control of this pandemic is very much related to the health care system that we have in the country.,209,,
1208,0.97,8833.357,8841.332,"And, a large proportion of our population is not just in Seattle but nationwide is uninsured or Underinsured.",209,,
1209,0.97,8841.332,8859.517,"And as many of you have seen, sent a letter to the Mayor and the county executive, that that is the main restriction that has to be addressed, which is the problem that many people cannot get tested or get the related medical care because they are either uninsured or Underinsured.",209,,
1210,0.97,8859.517,8867.892,I'm happy to see that - under the emergency throughout the state has declared today that the uninsured in our state will have free testing.,209,,
1211,0.97,8867.892,8893.251,"And we also had an emergency order sent to Washington health insurance providers to make sure that individuals were insured, but clearly many of them are Underinsured . that they will be covered for testing without Co-Pays and deductibles.",209,,
1212,0.97,8893.251,8894.752,They should be covered by Co- pays or deductibles.,209,,
1213,0.97,8894.752,8899.59,And in addition to that individuals will be able to have a one-time Refill on the prescriptions as part of that emergency order.,209,,
1214,0.97,8899.59,8901.259,I think these are all important developments that happen.,209,,
1215,0.97,8901.259,8906.43,But they also point towards the fact that we don't have the benefit of a nationwide Medicare for all Single-Payer health care system.,209,,
1216,0.97,8906.43,8923.347,"And, we can get the idea of what is possible through how different countries are dealing with the aftermath of this pandemic . South Korea, for example, has a Medicare for all like system and has used it to provide free Drive-Through Coronavirus testing for anyone who wants it.",209,,
1217,0.97,8923.347,8925.049,Even for people who do not have symptoms.,209,,
1218,0.97,8925.049,8934.025,"And in fact, they do it in a very effective manner, where they protect the health of the medical professionals as well he way they do it in SH with safety suits.",209,,
1219,0.97,8934.025,8945.469,"And make sure that the health professionals themselves are not impacted, because that also impacts public health overall.",209,,
1220,0.97,8945.469,8948.572,"With over 500 Drive-Through testing sites, South Korea has tested over 100,000 people.",209,,
1221,0.97,8948.572,8960.484,"So far, it is really glaring, the contrast with the United States, where as of yesterday, and maybe as of yesterday 500 total people in the U.S. has been tested.",209,,
1222,0.97,8960.484,8977.401,"It is really important to hear that the - Department at the University of Washington has now developed a new diagnostic test under FDA controls, that will allow them to test 1000 samples a day.",209,,
1223,0.97,8977.401,8978.002,This is important.,209,,
1224,0.97,8978.002,8980.271,But I just wanted to give a sense of the numbers.,209,,
1225,0.97,8980.271,8995.019,"If you look at, if you compare South Korea's numbers to the number 500 which we had Yesterdayin the United States, it means that you are over 1200 times more likely to have access to a Coronavirus test in South Korea than in the United States.",209,,
1226,0.97,8995.019,9000.925,"And keeping in mind, especially the South Korea and the United States cut the Coronavirus at least as far as we know, on the same day.",209,,
1227,0.97,9000.925,9014.672,"As Gail Healthcare expert Howard foreman has said, it is well within the realm of possibility that there are 100,000 people infected with this right now in the United States.",209,,
1228,0.97,9014.672,9021.112,"Up on the one hand, we don't want our constituents to panic.",209,,
1229,0.97,9021.112,9024.115,On the other hand we also want to deal with the seriousness that it deserves.,209,,
1230,0.97,9024.115,9032.022,"And, we know that the outcomes of the system that Prioritizes the profits of a few in the insurance, pharmaceutical and health management industries are often tragic.",209,,
1231,0.97,9032.022,9032.556,In normal circumstances.,209,,
1232,0.97,9032.556,9037.528,"But in the context of a global pandemic, the anarchy of this poor For-Profit system could be lethal to many in our society.",209,,
1233,0.97,9037.528,9041.365,Wanted and by saying that this is such an important case for Medicare for all.,209,,
1234,0.97,9041.365,9043.434,Thank you very much for bringing that point up.,210,,
1235,0.97,9043.434,9043.834,Thank you.,210,,
1236,0.97,9043.834,9044.435,Councilmember Pedersen.,210,,
1237,0.97,9044.435,9045.269,Thank you chair.,211,,
1238,0.97,9045.269,9056.981,"I agree with the Mayor that the public-health situation is an emergency, and I want to thank the Mayor for taking the initiative to issue this proclamation of the civil emergency.",211,,
1239,0.97,9056.981,9064.688,I am also pleased to support these helpful Clarifications that the Council is about to make to the proclamation.,211,,
1240,0.97,9064.688,9076.066,"The companion resolution, in my interpretation, it makes very productive requests rather than reducing the Mayor's Taxability in addressing the emergency.",211,,
1241,0.97,9076.066,9084.141,The requests include increasing the frequency of official reap ports that we all receive during this evolving emergency.,211,,
1242,0.97,9084.141,9089.313,Thank you.,211,,
1243,0.97,9089.313,9090.848,Thank you very much Councilmember Pedersen.,212,,

1255,0.97,9135.025,9143.767,"But, the Council will be reviewing, receiving weekly reports, and the proclamation is rescinded by the Council.",216,,
1256,0.97,9143.767,9149.907,"So, it has to be by two thirds vote, but we will be reviewing on a weekly basis, the status of the epidemic and our ability to respond.",216,,
1257,0.97,9149.907,9160.618,"And when folks in the city agreed that it's time, that is how the proclamation will be rescinded is by the city council making a two thirds vote.",216,,
1258,0.97,9160.618,9161.085,Excellent points.,217,,
1259,0.97,9161.085,9162.052,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,217,,
1260,0.97,9162.052,9172.997,"Seeing no other comments, the last comment I want to say is again our appreciation for the quick work of the folks on the ground.",217,,
1261,0.97,9172.997,9180.004,"We talked to some of the Department directors today, but we know it's the front-line workers, the firefighters, the human service Department workers, the long-term care providers.",217,,
1262,0.97,9180.004,9199.023,Those who are contract workers and those who are Janitorial workers who are really putting themselves out there and putting themselves at risk for both helping to make sure that our most Foldable in our community have what they need and there are also protected in a time like this.,217,,
1263,0.97,9199.023,9201.825,"So, we always want to honor their work, but especially in times like this.",217,,
1264,0.97,9201.825,9215.439,"My hope is that the process for expediting contracts and purchasing that is clearly articulated in this resolution and executive order will help to make sure that people have the equipment they need, the masks, the gloves, anything like that for our workers.",217,,
1265,0.97,9215.439,9219.476,We know we don't want people to inadvertently go out there and purchase masks.,217,,
1266,0.97,9219.476,9232.756,"Though should be actually saved for those who are ill, and our medical frontline providers.",217,,
1267,0.97,9232.756,9240.664,We want to make sure that our workers have what they need and I think this contracting procurement process outlined in here gives me hope that we can get Handwashing facilities across the city in a very quick Úway.,217,,
1268,0.97,9240.664,9245.269,I also think that we have done a lot in this proclamation to protect workers across the city.,217,,
1269,0.97,9245.269,9250.941,We wanted to be flexibility and also ensuring that flexibility we don't want to waive any of our protections for the safety and health of our city employees.,217,,
