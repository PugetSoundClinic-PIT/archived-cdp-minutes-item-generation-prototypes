35,0.97,160.193,164.197,"And colleagues, I want to welcome to the stage here Brian good night.",17,,
36,0.97,164.197,169.669,Brian is with our central staff team who has provided us with a memo and a presentation.,17,,
37,0.97,169.669,174.407,Both of those are linked on today's agenda and we'll be going over those in today's committee.,17,,
38,0.97,174.407,183.049,Central staff is here to present on the resolution that the capital projects watch list has created.,17,,
39,0.97,183.049,192.225,By way of reminder in 2018 Council passed resolution 318533 Co-Sponsored by Council members bag Shaw and Herbold.,17,,
40,0.97,192.225,198.164,This required the small list of capital projects that require enhanced quarterly reporting from the Mayor to be presented to Council.,17,,
41,0.97,198.164,208.274,Today we are going to hear about some of these proposed items on the list that has been transmitted by Mayor Harrell.,17,,
42,0.97,208.274,214.147,"Do company members have anything to add to the watch list notify Brian good night by March 22, Tuesday.",17,,
43,0.97,214.147,223.189,This is an opportunity for us to have a briefing today for you to see what the watch list includes for this year.,17,,
44,0.97,223.189,231.464,And if you do have any amendments for additional ideas you would like it add you are welcome to do that by notifying central staff next Tuesday.,17,,
45,0.97,231.464,243.242,We will endeavor to bring back to this Committee a final project watch list with any amendments that you all are suggesting.,17,,
46,0.97,243.242,247.313,By April 6. and April 6 woe would love to have a briefing discussion and possible vote.,17,,
47,0.97,247.313,253.353,Brian I'll turn it over to you to walk us through the reporting we have in front of us for our Council Revow.,18,,
48,0.97,253.353,265.131,"And again colleagues, if you haven't had the chance to dive into this watch list before, this includes a list of possible project for increased departments or city budget to provide us with additional oversight.",18,,
49,0.97,265.131,271.371,We do try to keep this list pretty short because we have limited capacity.,18,,
50,0.97,271.371,276.776,Obviously from staff within various Department to make sure they are adding additional detail for us.,18,,
51,0.97,276.776,278.077,That is always appreciated.,18,,
52,0.97,278.077,287.186,"If you are thinking about adding a specific project to this list, just would encourage you to be cautious or thoughtful about the long list already.",18,,
53,0.97,287.186,289.589,And the work that they have.,18,,
54,0.97,289.589,296.295,"And with that, I will turn it over first, let me just double check to see if our vice chair has joined us.",18,,
55,0.97,296.295,296.929,She has not yet.,18,,
56,0.97,296.929,304.037,If she does I want to make sure to turn it over to her given her work in crafting this watch list and the resolution from the past.,18,,
57,0.97,304.037,306.673,"And with that, Brian, I think we are ready for you.",18,,
58,0.97,306.673,309.609,If you would like to take it away.,18,,
59,0.97,309.609,309.876,Okay.,19,,
60,0.97,309.876,311.144,Thank you very much.,19,,
61,0.97,311.144,312.178,Good morning Councilmember.,19,,
62,0.97,312.178,318.084,For the record Brian good night for Council central staff.,19,,
63,0.97,318.084,325.324,I will share my screen now to briefly walk through the proposed capital project list.,19,,
64,0.97,325.324,328.861,Hopefully you all can see that now.,19,,
65,0.97,328.861,337.303,So as Council member Mosqueda said in 2018 the Council established expectations for enhanced reporting on a watch list of capital improvement programs.,20,,
66,0.97,337.303,348.348,The process calls for the executive to propose a list of projects Forren collusion on the annual watch list by January 15 of each year and the Council typically ADOPTS the watch list via resolution.,20,,
67,0.97,348.348,352.719,You may have noticed the agenda for today's meeting doesn't include the resolution yet.,20,,
68,0.97,352.719,357.99,That is just an issue of timing.,20,,
69,0.97,357.99,359.125,A resolution that be drafted.,20,,
70,0.97,359.125,365.565,The resolution as draft reflects the executive's roped list of projects for 2022 that we'll walk through in just a moment.,20,,
71,0.97,365.565,369.102,Which is a starting police for the Council's consideration.,20,,
72,0.97,369.102,374.574,So on January 14 the executive did submit a proposed list of projects for 2022.,20,,
73,0.97,374.574,384.117,The list contains 18 projects from six city Department and there is only one change from the list Council adopted in 2021.,20,,
74,0.97,384.117,390.723,The executive has proposed Remanufacturing the Seattle dam of transportation's Northgate bridge and cycle track project because it is now open to pedestrian traffic.,20,,
75,0.97,390.723,396.963,And unless there is any questions at this point I'll just move on to going through the list.,20,,
76,0.97,396.963,407.206,So the first Department that has a project on the proposed watch list for 2022 is Finance and administrative serves and the project is the replacement of fire station 31.,21,,
77,0.97,407.206,419.919,"This project is still in the initial design phase, which is why there is a project cost range of 35 to $56 million rather then a more concrete total project cost figure.",21,,
78,0.97,419.919,426.092,"Just by way of context, project budgets from typically established once it reaches the 30% designed milestone.",21,,
79,0.97,426.092,434.233,I also take just a brief moment to describe where the information comes from since you'll see that in this slide and then on the future slides as well.,21,,
80,0.97,434.233,441.007,So the figure comes from a summary section at the top of each project page and the capital improvement patrolling book.,21,,
81,0.97,441.007,444.377,It is a separate feel the departments must update.,21,,
82,0.97,444.377,454.487,"So in some cases if you are cross Referencing this presentation along with the book, the amounts won't exactly match what the plan spending is over the six years of the CIP.",21,,
83,0.97,454.487,466.699,This could be the case either because the project extends beyond the 6 year time frame or because of just a simple oversight by a department updating the field.,21,,
84,0.97,466.699,470.503,And just to provide clarification these amounts will not appear to establish the watch list.,21,,
85,0.97,470.503,473.706,These are just on the slides if informational purposes only.,21,,
86,0.97,473.706,479.812,And I'm going to pause real quick and welcome vice chair Herbold to the committee.,22,,
87,0.97,479.812,483.416,Wanted it NOTE it for the record.,22,,
88,0.97,483.416,505.338,"Council member Herbold, if you do have any additional context regarding the creation of the watch list or any comments after you hear the presentation, I'll go ahead and turn to you force it provide comments and then we'll take other Council members.",22,,
89,0.97,505.338,507.874,All right Brian.,23,,
90,0.97,507.874,508.674,Please go ahead.,23,,
91,0.97,508.674,508.975,Great.,24,,
92,0.97,508.975,509.942,Thank you.,24,,
93,0.97,509.942,515.414,So the next Department is the information technology Department and they have just one project on the list.,25,,
94,0.97,515.414,524.657,It is a project estimated a little more than $49 million and is intended to replace an outdated case management system.,25,,
95,0.97,524.657,526.959,And I'm not going to spend a lot of time.,25,,
96,0.97,526.959,530.029,Please stop me if you have questions.,25,,
97,0.97,530.029,531.397,This is just an Overvow.,25,,
98,0.97,531.397,537.703,So the next Department is Seattle city lights and there are two projects on the proposed list for them.,26,,
99,0.97,537.703,550.349,The first is a utility Relocations project related to work on the waterfront and the second is related to overhead equipment replacements and this does include the full replacement program that city has been undertaking.,26,,
100,0.97,550.349,551.717,For that project in particular.,26,,
101,0.97,551.717,557.823,You'll notice that the cost column is a little different than the others.,26,,
102,0.97,557.823,564.363,And this is because that project isn't a discrete project but rather an ongoing program of work.,26,,
103,0.97,564.363,578.477,"So although the project doesn't have a specific total cost, the slide does show the amount of planned spending that is in the six year CIP, to provide context for how large that program is.",26,,
104,0.97,578.477,585.451,The next two slides are going to show projects proposed for Sdot.,27,,
105,0.97,585.451,593.759,There are nine can't projects for Sdot and that makes up half of the projects on the proposed list.,27,,
106,0.97,593.759,607.473,"Of the first five, two are related to rapid ride lines and the others are the always Atlas an way main corridor the center city streetcar project and the Georgetown to South Park trail.",27,,
107,0.97,607.473,621.52,And the other before I projects are the North Lake retaining wall the overlook walk East West connections rapid ride for Roosevelt and last but MOTT least the project related to the repair of the West Seattle bridge.,28,,
108,0.97,621.52,623.789,And there are two more Department.,29,,
109,0.97,623.789,626.892,Seattle parks and recreation has three projects on the list.,29,,
110,0.97,626.892,639.005,"The replacement of the Lake City community center, the rehabilitation and rebuilding of public park facilities on waterfront piers, and the development of Smith Cove park.",29,,
111,0.97,639.005,645.878,"And Lastly, the last Department is Seattle public utilities and they have two projects.",30,,
112,0.97,645.878,657.256,The first is the largest capital project the city has the ship Canal water quality project and the second is the South Park storm water program to reduce flooding in the South Park neighborhood.,30,,
113,0.97,657.256,662.328,"And the final slide I have is simply next steps, and Council member Mosqueda touched on this.",31,,
114,0.97,662.328,664.23,So I won't spend too long on it.,31,,
115,0.97,664.23,670.269,"But if you have proposed amendments for the list, it would be helpful to know of them by March 22.",31,,
116,0.97,670.269,676.175,And at the April 6 meeting the resolution will be before you and any amendments.,31,,
117,0.97,676.175,678.411,"Thank you very much, Brian.",32,,
118,0.97,678.411,683.449,And thanks for the memo as well attached to our agenda.,32,,
119,0.97,683.449,686.052,"Vice chair Herbold, please go ahead.",32,,
120,0.97,686.052,691.957,There is one amendment I am interested in potentially pursuing.,33,,
121,0.97,691.957,700.8,"It is related to the South Park storm water project that you just mentioned, Brian.",33,,
122,0.97,700.8,707.64,That project has a related project in Sdot called the s Pu partnership South park.,33,,
123,0.97,707.64,714.447,That is listed for just under $10 million with 8.1 listed in spending during 2022.,33,,
124,0.97,714.447,743.175,"The s Pu, project as you mentioned is a pump station, and the description under the Sdot project describes the Sdot project which is not on the watch list saying the project will be used to partner with s Pu's South Park drainage improvement and the funding will allow to install the needed collection system and repair the deteriorated roads.",33,,
125,0.97,743.175,763.028,"Given these two projects are so closely related and the two departments are Partnering on the project and one element is included on the watch list and the other isn't, I'm interested in potentially adding Sdot project to the public utilities project since they are related.",33,,
126,0.97,763.028,767.433,I don't thank you very much Council member Herbold.,33,,
127,0.97,767.433,771.203,Thanks for the early heads up on that.,33,,
128,0.97,771.203,775.307,"Any additional Council members have questions, comments, like to flag anything?",34,,
129,0.97,775.307,775.508,Okay.,34,,
130,0.97,775.508,785.651,I do appreciate the creation of this list and the request from Council member Herbold and Council member bag Shaw at the time.,34,,
131,0.97,785.651,793.793,I appreciate the continued commitment from the Harrell administration to work with come on providing this watch list and thank you Brian for all the work you are doing on this.,34,,
132,0.97,793.793,800.266,"And again, if Council members do have amendments that you would like to see, the deadline is March 22.",34,,
133,0.97,800.266,808.14,So that Brian can make those amendments before it comes to us at our next committee.,34,,
134,0.97,808.14,808.607,Vice chair Herbold.,34,,
135,0.97,808.607,808.908,Thanks.,35,,
136,0.97,808.908,817.316,I want to make a pitch for how I hope that this list will be used if the future.,35,,
137,0.97,817.316,823.455,It has never quite realized I think its full potential.,35,,
138,0.97,823.455,842.374,The intent I know has been discussed of the list as to allow the Council to have more information and more oversight of projects that are identified as according to criteria that we have agreed on with the Department and the budget office.,35,,
139,0.97,842.374,867.299,"The hope has always been that when we get our reports on the project on these lists, that the committees that are sort of the home to the projects would then use their committee time to do sort of a deeper dive on the reporting on the projects on the watch list, just with the idea of getting more transparency and more eyes on the projects.",35,,
140,0.97,867.299,871.87,Of course I know our committee schedules have been deeply impacted over the last two years.,35,,
141,0.97,871.87,878.544,But just wanted to put a pitch out there for that.,35,,
142,0.97,878.544,878.844,Once again.,35,,
143,0.97,878.844,879.178,Thanks.,35,,
144,0.97,879.178,882.748,Thank you very much Council member.,36,,
145,0.97,882.748,883.349,That is helpful context.,36,,
146,0.97,883.349,883.849,Thanks to adding that.,36,,
147,0.97,883.849,886.852,"Okay, Brian, I don't think there is any additional comments or questions for you.",37,,
148,0.97,886.852,893.092,I want to thank you for your time and the work you have done.,37,,
149,0.97,893.092,909.275,"Look forward to seeing you April 6, and colleagues another heads up to you, we do look forward to getting those amendments worked into this list if there are any by the 22 so that we can have a briefing discussion and possible vote on April 6.",37,,
150,0.97,909.275,909.675,Okay.,38,,
151,0.97,909.675,910.242,Thank you.,38,,
152,0.97,910.242,910.843,"Take care, Brian.",38,,
153,0.97,910.843,918.584,Let's move on to item two on our agenda.,39,,

159,0.97,951.817,960.793,It is an opportunity for us to update our policies to really reflect current practices.,41,,
160,0.97,960.793,971.103,I want to thank interim director and central staff if the work they have done with us for the now two years and three months as I have been serving Aur chair of budget and if I innocence.,41,,

174,0.97,1065.798,1066.065,Facebook.,43,,
175,0.97,1066.065,1079.978,Council member I'll turn it over to Tom to introduce himself while I share my screen.,43,,
176,0.97,1079.978,1080.846,"Good morning, thank you,.",44,,
177,0.97,1080.846,1085.584,"Thank you, I want to make sure, are you so long the presentation?",45,,
178,0.97,1085.584,1088.687,My screen looks a little odd right now.,45,,
179,0.97,1088.687,1088.987,Okay great.,45,,
180,0.97,1088.987,1099.298,We are going to briefly walk you through the plan for updating the regular payments of claims bill.,45,,
181,0.97,1099.298,1111.343,"So as chair Mosqueda described, this proposal is in an effort to identify opportunities to increase transparency and clarity in the city's budget.",45,,
182,0.97,1111.343,1111.944,Process and financial manage.,45,,
183,0.97,1111.944,1116.882,So we have been looking at the payments of claims bill for about a year now.,45,,
184,0.97,1116.882,1122.087,And getting more familiar with it and thinking about how we could improve the process.,45,,
185,0.97,1122.087,1130.562,"So just on background, the city charter requires presentation of certain payment of claims through the city council prior to making payment.",45,,
186,0.97,1130.562,1137.603,So the city council considers regularly payments of claims bill at its council meetings held every Tuesday afternoon.,45,,
187,0.97,1137.603,1143.275,Every other week of that bill includes authorization of paying the city's payroll.,45,,
188,0.97,1143.275,1146.078,The payment and claims bill uses the standard format.,45,,
189,0.97,1146.078,1150.816,"As the chair described, it has not been updated since at least 1999.",45,,
190,0.97,1150.816,1176.575,"As we have been locking at some of the various legislative tools that are used in the city's budget and financial management systems, we identified at least one issue with this bill, which is that the template includes reference to an auditing committee.",45,,
191,0.97,1176.575,1184.082,The committee would make a recommendation about whether to approve those payments or not that.,45,,
192,0.97,1184.082,1189.488,Auditing committee was limited in November of 1999 but the template for this bill has not been updated.,45,,
193,0.97,1189.488,1202.701,So the proposed changes we are working on with chair Mosqueda would request a resolution that the Department of finance and administrative services use an updated template for the weekly payment of claims.,45,,
194,0.97,1202.701,1222.821,The intent here is to clarify mat purpose of the bill is so it will provide greater transparency to the public and clarity to elected officials who are being asked to make a decision on these bills and updating the language to reflect current practice and reference current state law regarding the city's budgets.,45,,
195,0.97,1222.821,1236.668,"So specifically, we would be considering changes to the template to remove references to the obsolete auditing committee.",46,,
196,0.97,1236.668,1242.808,And payments and claims presented by the executive are consistent with the current adopted budget authority.,46,,
197,0.97,1242.808,1245.21,That includes all approved budget amendments.,46,,
198,0.97,1245.21,1258.357,So any changes approved throughout the year to the adopted budget would and any payments made based on those would be consistent and makes explicit reference to current state law around the budget act.,46,,
199,0.97,1258.357,1268.3,"So it really won't change what the city is doing generally, but it provides more specificity in what the Council is being asked to approve.",46,,
200,0.97,1268.3,1273.972,So it is a fairly technical exercise in terms of updating that bill.,46,,
201,0.97,1273.972,1289.421,Oh our next step is to work with the Department of finance and administrative services to develop the agreed upon template and then introduce a resolution for consideration at the Finance and housing Committee in April.,47,,
202,0.97,1289.421,1310.008,"And really, the purpose of doing this through resolution is to Memorialize the direction the Council is providing, and ensuring that, in the future, that the changes the proposed changes to the template persist unless directed otherwise by the city Council and agreed to by the Department of finance and Menstruatetive services.",47,,
203,0.97,1310.008,1316.481,I don't is he that is a quick summary of the proposal.,47,,
204,0.97,1316.481,1317.916,We are happy to answer questions.,47,,
205,0.97,1317.916,1321.253,Thank you very much.,48,,

208,0.97,1325.524,1350.082,"Since I have been in this seat, for the last two years as your budget chair, I have really tried to take the opportunity to mine the expert minds of Tom and Ali as we look at where other jurisdictions have made inroads into greater Ransparency and Acounse and an opportunity to Deconstruct the budget and budget making for members of the public.",48,,

211,0.97,1360.892,1377.442,"This may sound minor, but I think it is an important element to our larger efforts to provide additional ways for members of the public and us as Council members as well to have all the information we need as we look at the budgets in front of us.",48,,
212,0.97,1377.442,1378.61,Any additional comments or questions?,48,,

215,0.97,1385.384,1388.487,"I don't no, Madam chair, Ali covered it very well.",48,,
216,0.97,1388.487,1401.5,"With that, colleagues, if you have any questions in the meantime of course you know where to find central staff and look forward to having some language in the form of a resolution in front of us in April for your consideration.",49,,
217,0.97,1401.5,1402.834,"Okay, thanks so much, everyone.",50,,
218,0.97,1402.834,1412.677,"Thank for the early heads up on that, S we can have a robust conversation in anticipation of the drafting.",50,,

225,0.97,1431.997,1439.871,"So if we don't have everyone already, if we could send them a quick message to let them know we are coming in early, that would be great.",53,,
226,0.97,1439.871,1448.079,"As we are doing that, I want to thank Council member Herbold, who really put this item on our radar.",53,,

240,0.97,1535.1,1553.151,"Back in 2015 a report found that across every census division in the United States, Seattle has the host developed services for Lgbtq older adults and their families.",56,,
241,0.97,1553.151,1557.722,We are also running behind on developing housing for Lgbtq seniors.,56,,
242,0.97,1557.722,1578.143,In April of 2016 Council passed legislation that put the housing levee on the November 2016 ballot and we specifically called out Lgbtq seniors as a priority population in the ordinance putting it on the ballot.,56,,
243,0.97,1578.143,1596.795,The Lgbtq seniors were the only specific demographic named because the Council wanted to emphasize the importance of meeting the completely up met need for this population.,56,,
244,0.97,1596.795,1619.217,Then in 2017 we worked to Prioritize housing development no Lgbtq seniors and at the time Capitol Hill housing applied for funds for Lgbtq senior housing in 2017 that request with his in the awarded.,56,,
245,0.97,1619.217,1625.824,And the community again began organizing toward lifting up that shared goal.,56,,
246,0.97,1625.824,1635.033,The community tried a new approach and in 2018 the come approved funding if a housing needs study for low income Lgbtq seniors.,56,,
247,0.97,1635.033,1643.608,I want to recognize former Council member and former Council President Gonzalez in helping to champion that funding.,56,,
248,0.97,1643.608,1664.162,"Over 500 people completed that survey, which identified the challenges in supporting Lgbtq Elders and concluded again what we had already found that Seattle was falling behind other major metropolitan areas in providing services to Lgbtq seniors.",56,,
249,0.97,1664.162,1674.939,It called for creating an Lgbtq senior center and affordable Lgbtq senior housing.,56,,
250,0.97,1674.939,1680.412,Scoured $9.8 million from the office of housing in 2021.,56,,
251,0.97,1680.412,1685.083,And you know I really appreciate their tenacity in pursuing this vision.,56,,
252,0.97,1685.083,1700.932,"I think we all have had that experience where some things are a really good idea and you just try, try try again and now they are here to talk to us about pride place I don't thank you.",56,,
253,0.97,1700.932,1703.535,Really exited about the presentation in front of us.,56,,

255,0.97,1711.242,1713.878,We have been following along on the videos you have been putting out.,56,,
256,0.97,1713.878,1720.885,I know there is a lot of joy and hope for this project as Council member Herbold noted.,56,,
257,0.97,1720.885,1731.362,I can't wait to hear more and look forward to what you have done in a very short period of time as well since you did have the ground breaking last September.,56,,
258,0.97,1731.362,1735.233,"With that Ceo Pearson, I'm going to turn it over to you.",56,,

264,0.97,1760.492,1760.892,"Hi, everyone.",58,,
265,0.97,1760.892,1765.597,So happy to be here and thank you for having us.,58,,
266,0.97,1765.597,1771.102,"As I think you know, Steven nip the executive director is unable to attend today.",58,,
267,0.97,1771.102,1785.817,"And I have been involved with this project just for a little under a year now, helping with the fundraising for pride police.",58,,
268,0.97,1785.817,1805.403,"So just to give you a little background, in 2015 the first national study of Lgbtq mid life and older adults was conducted by aging with pride out of the University of Washington.",58,,
269,0.97,1805.403,1819.25,"And they sought to answer one primary question, which was do lobe people age differently than the general population in and the slide here shows what was found from that study.",58,,
270,0.97,1819.25,1833.631,"Primarily, only 15% of Lgbtq seniors access services and that 15% of them fear Accessing Healthcare services outside of their own community.",58,,
271,0.97,1833.631,1839.404,So these and other Statistics really were the.,58,,
272,0.97,1839.404,1852.05,And at this point it is dedicated and serving and empowering older Lgbtq adults and their families in King County and surrounding areas.,58,,
273,0.97,1852.05,1863.261,"And we provide fitness, educational and recreational opportunities to meet the specific needs of the community, and also offer a range of individual case management and support groups for Caregivers.",58,,
274,0.97,1863.261,1875.106,"And starting next year at the new center we'll be providing affordable meals and health services, in addition to the other services we provide currently.",58,,
275,0.97,1875.106,1880.578,And this site will also be the first home for the mission.,58,,
276,0.97,1880.578,1888.72,"Right new, the office is based in 1Th Avenue along with community housing and other Nonprofits.",58,,
277,0.97,1888.72,1894.492,But we are really exited about having their own Stamm and their own community and their own building.,58,,
278,0.97,1894.492,1897.562,"So I'll turn it over to back to Coilly, I believe.",58,,
279,0.97,1897.562,1906.604,I think it is over to Chris.,59,,
280,0.97,1906.604,1908.506,"Sorry, Chris.",60,,
281,0.97,1908.506,1909.607,I was muted.,61,,
282,0.97,1909.607,1923.554,"So a little bit about community housing, we are a 45-year-old community based organization really serving the entire city.",61,,
283,0.97,1923.554,1931.663,"We develop, manage affordable housing throughout the city and increasingly outside the city, surveying over 2000 residents.",61,,
284,0.97,1931.663,1962.694,"And one of the things we have been focused on as an organization, Asening most of the cities Council members know is deep partnership with community organizations like with Africa town and black opportunity impact alliance, and African Plaza and our work here at pride place.",61,,
285,0.97,1962.694,1974.072,We are very thrilled to be part of this project and locking forward to getting it under construction again soon.,61,,
286,0.97,1974.072,1981.212,"As Council member Herbold mentioned this is a project we have been working on for a long, long time.",62,,
287,0.97,1981.212,1992.256,"It has chipping location once, and we have you know, had a long community process for determining it as the partner.",62,,
288,0.97,1992.256,2007.638,"They will be elected as you know on the bottom floor, as well as providing services to the Mount and the residents of the building.",62,,
289,0.97,2007.638,2015.446,"Over to Mason to tell us a little about the senior center and Hi, everybody.",63,,
290,0.97,2015.446,2019.317,I'm a senior development manager at community roots.,63,,
291,0.97,2019.317,2025.923,As Chris mentioned we have a 4400 square foot space for the community center access at ground level.,63,,
292,0.97,2025.923,2033.398,We have a main lobby entrance where you can enter into the affordable housing space or the pride space.,63,,
293,0.97,2033.398,2041.572,We have our satellite health center it is what is shade in Pinkish red along Broadway.,63,,
294,0.97,2041.572,2049.68,That is going to be a health services site.,63,,
295,0.97,2049.68,2056.487,And with gay city to provide primary care to Lgbtq residents.,63,,
296,0.97,2056.487,2058.589,We also have a large community meeting space.,63,,
297,0.97,2058.589,2062.093,That is about 1000 feet with the capacity of 75 people.,63,,
298,0.97,2062.093,2069.801,We'll be able to Reconfession that space in a variety of ways with a retractable partition down the middle and modular furniture.,63,,
299,0.97,2069.801,2082.58,And we'll be hosting a meal program in there there is an overhead garage door that provides open air access into the courtyard as well.,63,,
300,0.97,2082.58,2085.149,We have a full commercial kitchen.,63,,
301,0.97,2085.149,2088.286,The idea is providing several meal services per woke.,63,,
302,0.97,2088.286,2095.393,"The kitchen is set up to provide 50 to 75 meals, probably three to give times a week as of Mao.",63,,
303,0.97,2095.393,2096.894,That is the idea.,63,,
304,0.97,2096.894,2098.729,We also have office space.,63,,
305,0.97,2098.729,2117.215,There is an open office floor plan for eight to 10 staff and we have two private staff offices for the director level positions in addition to a conference roll and two small Meeting/Zoom rooms and a break room.,63,,
306,0.97,2117.215,2122.787,This will certainly be revolutionary for the ability to create a headquarters situation they own.,63,,
307,0.97,2122.787,2139.604,So they are not subject to the whims of the market and one where they have an anchor and a building serving both tenants of the building and of the broader community.,63,,
308,0.97,2139.604,2141.539,"Thanks, Mason.",64,,
309,0.97,2141.539,2142.707,"Back to you, Sarah.",64,,
310,0.97,2142.707,2155.086,So this is a modular vow of what the community gathering space might look like.,65,,
311,0.97,2155.086,2157.622,And hold on one second.,65,,
312,0.97,2157.622,2157.955,I apologize.,65,,
313,0.97,2157.955,2167.665,So there is back here is the kind of gathering area.,65,,
314,0.97,2167.665,2178.276,And this will also be the center for where services will be provided.,65,,
315,0.97,2178.276,2181.078,"Clouding meals, wellness, support and social networking to combat health challenges.",65,,
316,0.97,2181.078,2203.301,I know that we have already received some money from the city of Seattle's aging disability services for meal programs.,65,,
317,0.97,2203.301,2204.502,Right now.,65,,
318,0.97,2204.502,2208.673,"I don't yes, that the just a Companiry of the planned services at pride place.",65,,
319,0.97,2208.673,2219.016,We talked about meals already and some of the social networking and wellness support.,65,,
320,0.97,2219.016,2219.283,Services.,65,,
321,0.97,2219.283,2229.427,We also provide Caregivers support case management and Lgbtq friendly referrals.,65,,
322,0.97,2229.427,2234.599,"And facilitate Intergenerational Lgbtq mentor and chat programs, transpacific referrals and support.",65,,
323,0.97,2234.599,2246.911,And we train other regional senior centers and housing providers on how to include culturally competent care and Lgbtq affirming environment.,65,,
324,0.97,2246.911,2247.545,"Thanks, Sarah.",66,,
325,0.97,2247.545,2250.982,So I'll just talk you all through how we are funding this project.,67,,
326,0.97,2250.982,2258.122,You can see this is the Funning stack for pride place the total development cost of $52.2 million.,67,,
327,0.97,2258.122,2267.198,"As you can see, we financed it using the low income tax credit program and have also received funding from the city, state and County.",67,,
328,0.97,2267.198,2281.746,We did have a gap on the project we are filling through a capital campaign which I will say more about in the following slides.,67,,
329,0.97,2281.746,2288.452,So these are both part of a unique collaborating fundraising effort called rise together.,67,,
330,0.97,2288.452,2298.062,We are a group of six community based nonprofit organizations with a collective vision for the future without a displacement where everyone can share in our region's success.,67,,
331,0.97,2298.062,2314.679,"Together we are raising $40 million to build more than 400 new affordable homes in the central district, Capitol Hill and center alongside space for health and human services and small run businesses.",67,,
332,0.97,2314.679,2319.517,We have raised more than $20 million to date toward that goal.,67,,
333,0.97,2319.517,2322.286,Around $12 million left to raise collectively.,67,,
334,0.97,2322.286,2338.202,And his Cam opinion really is about creating new opportunities for residents across these rapidly changing residences in Seattle that includes pride place the first Lgbtq affirming affordable housing in Seattle.,67,,
335,0.97,2338.202,2342.907,So her's slightly more detailed breakdown of the capital campaign for pride place.,68,,
336,0.97,2342.907,2351.148,"In order to build up the senior center cold Shell, we need to raise $2 million and we have raised 1.2 to date.",68,,
337,0.97,2351.148,2361.459,"To complete the tenant improvement for the center, we need $2.3 million and we have raised $2 million to date so really getting close on that.",68,,
338,0.97,2361.459,2371.569,And then also raising funds for a transitional rating fund to support their needed growth to operate this new senior center.,68,,
339,0.97,2371.569,2375.473,"So all together, we have raised about $3.25 million toward a $5 million goal.",68,,
340,0.97,2375.473,2379.677,It is our hope to raise the remaining funds this year.,68,,
341,0.97,2379.677,2387.418,And we just wanted to let you guys know that we are holding a benefit for pride place on May 15.,69,,
342,0.97,2387.418,2389.854,So please do save the date.,69,,
343,0.97,2389.854,2407.204,"It is called out and proud it really is about celebrating Lgbtq Elders and so I know they are still working on details around Venue and getting tickets out for sale, but more to come on that.",69,,
344,0.97,2407.204,2415.413,I'll turn it over to Mason to talk project status Timeline.,69,,
345,0.97,2415.413,2416.714,"Sure, thanks, Kylie.",70,,
346,0.97,2416.714,2422.92,So as previously mentioned we did break ground in September October 2021.,70,,
347,0.97,2422.92,2430.928,With the expectation that we'd be complete in April 2023 after about an 18 month construction term.,70,,
348,0.97,2430.928,2435.065,That has been derailed some what by the start of the concrete workers strike in December.,70,,
349,0.97,2435.065,2439.637,So as of now we are about three months delayed.,70,,
350,0.97,2439.637,2453.684,So the expectation is that hopeful we are going to have a resolution to the concrete impasse Seener than later.,70,,
351,0.97,2453.684,2453.951,In 2023.,70,,
352,0.97,2453.951,2467.097,We are also hoping to optimize the timing of the tenant improvement build out such that we are not starting the Buildout once we complete construction on the affording housing project.,70,,
353,0.97,2467.097,2467.598,We are hoping to start.,70,,
354,0.97,2467.598,2479.844,About eight months prior to the completion of the broader project so that we are finishing construction on the affordable housing speech and the improvements at the same time.,70,,
355,0.97,2479.844,2488.485,So they can start offering services to residents in the building once the building is complete and residents start moving in.,70,,
356,0.97,2488.485,2491.522,"Right new, we are effectively seized up.",70,,
357,0.97,2491.522,2505.87,"But again, the hope is that we will where were up construction in the summer of 2023, and then be stabilized in operational in Q3 hopefully not Q4 2023.",70,,
358,0.97,2505.87,2508.239,With that I'll happened it back over to Chris.,70,,
359,0.97,2508.239,2512.776,Okay just hop in there for a quick second to add additional context.,71,,
360,0.97,2512.776,2537.034,And I know a lot of folks have been Senting messages of solidarity for the striking teamster concrete drivers and I might Reframe it to say that I think Frommy perspective the stall is largely due to the companies not coming to the table in good faith and offering only a nickel increase in the last negotiation.,71,,
361,0.97,2537.034,2541.705,So I think over 115 days definitely would make an impact on your project.,71,,
362,0.97,2541.705,2544.074,That is important you call it out thank you.,71,,
363,0.97,2544.074,2554.852,Also I want to call out some of the behavior we have seen on the employer side with an unwillingness to come to the table and negotiate in good faith.,72,,
364,0.97,2554.852,2574.672,"And Council member Herbold did a great job summarizing some of the concerning behavior of the sort of you know the consequences that have behavior in her latest newsletter, which we lifted a little bit of this my newsletter yesterday.",72,,
365,0.97,2574.672,2577.141,But I want to say thanks for first noting it.,72,,
366,0.97,2577.141,2587.184,Because we know it is an important element of how it affected your Timeline and didn't want that to be dismissed at all.,72,,
367,0.97,2587.184,2590.421,Because I know the Timeline has been dramatically affected.,72,,
368,0.97,2590.421,2594.458,But also want to particular Amen to thank the teamsters.,72,,
369,0.97,2594.458,2602.299,As of yesterday they have begun to do some work even though they are definitely on trying and I can only imagine that is a tough they think to do.,72,,
370,0.97,2602.299,2606.17,Sometimes a strike is your last Leveraging opportunity.,72,,
371,0.97,2606.17,2628.425,"But since these companies appears it is going to pass the cost on to all of us, we all want to Spore them as they try to go back on this level for working but don't want to Miss the opportunity to let the employers know while that work may continue in some form, all of us, including those who need affordable housing and want a West Seattle bridge, want them to bargain in good faith.",72,,
372,0.97,2628.425,2635.499,So the pressure is not off those employers to come to the table and bargain from good faith so projects like this can continue.,72,,
373,0.97,2635.499,2643.04,Appreciate the pressure being placed on them so they come back with offers that are better than a nickel in these times.,72,,
374,0.97,2643.04,2648.712,"I thank you, Christopher for letting Mio pine for a second.",73,,
375,0.97,2648.712,2660.124,I'll pass it become to you and definitely appreciate and understand the importance of how that has impacted this Timeline.,73,,
376,0.97,2660.124,2661.859,So thanks for sharing that.,73,,
377,0.97,2661.859,2670.868,And about I have to say just underscores what you just said Council President Mosqueda.,74,,
378,0.97,2670.868,2680.944,We were very grateful to see the God faith offer of the drivers and returning to work on projects and the message from Rick Hicks.,74,,
379,0.97,2680.944,2685.783,We are a mission based organization.,74,,
380,0.97,2685.783,2698.062,"So we absolutely support fair wages for the workers health insurance, the right to strike.",74,,
381,0.97,2698.062,2708.605,"We feel very Conflictedmy the fact that the impasse, and we refer to it as an impasse, because we don't want it to sound like it is the fault of the strike.",74,,
382,0.97,2708.605,2725.856,"But the impasse has created enormous additional costs on our projects through March on pride place alone, we estimate additional costs to be $1.7 million.",74,,
383,0.97,2725.856,2731.562,And the cost of all of our project through March is north of $4 million.,74,,
384,0.97,2731.562,2735.833,This is the additional cost by the impact.,74,,
385,0.97,2735.833,2742.606,"And our projections have showed that going up at about $870,000 a month.",74,,
386,0.97,2742.606,2748.879,So those are significant costs as an industry we are talking about.,74,,
387,0.97,2748.879,2759.757,How we are going to find sources to help us pay for those holes in our budget as they become clearer.,74,,
388,0.97,2759.757,2767.498,And certainly looking to our partners at the state and city to support those efforts.,74,,
389,0.97,2767.498,2805.202,"One of the messages that has been more difficult to convey is that with, because of the really kind of Quirky and arcane financing that we use for affordable housing financing, there are also very significant cliffs we face in if I Innocencing and recapture events where the investors can you know, force repayment of all of the equity.",74,,
390,0.97,2805.202,2813.977,And so we have analyzed those and analyzed the absolute drop dead date that we have to be under construction.,74,,
391,0.97,2813.977,2826.29,"We have been in contact with the teamsters and lock forward to working Collaboratively with them, moving our project forward as quickly as possible.",74,,
392,0.97,2826.29,2845.142,"Not only are we delayed in delivering vital affordable housing to folks, but the risk placed on the projects themselves and the developers of those projects is existential.",74,,
393,0.97,2845.142,2850.948,And we'd like folks to understand that as well.,74,,
394,0.97,2850.948,2855.953,So I think that concludes the presentation.,75,,
395,0.97,2855.953,2860.958,We would be happy to we are any questions that anybody might have.,75,,
396,0.97,2860.958,2862.659,I don't that was a really great presentation.,75,,
397,0.97,2862.659,2865.529,I want to thank all of you.,75,,
398,0.97,2865.529,2872.536,"Thank you so much Mason and Kylie thank you Sarah, thank you Christopher.",75,,
399,0.97,2872.536,2879.109,And thank you Council member Herbold for helping to get this on our agenda here today so that we could get an update.,75,,
400,0.97,2879.109,2886.35,And I know that this is something I heard a ton about when I first came into office as well.,75,,
401,0.97,2886.35,2889.353,So you have been working on it for longer than that.,75,,
402,0.97,2889.353,2894.124,It is great to see it come to fruition and heartbreaking to have this impasse.,75,,
403,0.97,2894.124,2901.064,I appreciate the word impasse that is affecting all of you.,75,,
404,0.97,2901.064,2904.568,Look forward to hearing more from our Cole please.,75,,
405,0.97,2904.568,2907.604,Portfolios go ahead Council member Herbold.,75,,
406,0.97,2907.604,2910.173,Thank you.,76,,
407,0.97,2910.173,2924.154,I have one question about the project's services associated with the project and a question of concrete streak.,76,,
408,0.97,2924.154,2937.034,Slide eight talked about planned service to train regional senior centers and housing providers on how to include culturally competent care in an Lgbtq affirming environment.,76,,
409,0.97,2937.034,2941.071,I wanted to hear a little bit more about that need as identified.,76,,
410,0.97,2941.071,2952.049,I think it tracks back to some of the surveys you have done as well as what your plan is for providing that service to the broader provider community.,76,,
411,0.97,2952.049,3006.003,"That is one question I don't then as it relates to the strike, Madam chair Mosqueda mentioned there has been a significant development, and the teamsters have offered to four of the concrete suppliers that they will, they are willing to begin delivering concrete again for those four suppliers and I'm just wondering whether or not this project has one of those four suppliers as its concrete provider.",76,,
412,0.97,3006.003,3036.032,I have reached out with Rick Hicks hoping to have a conversation with him today just to make sure that we are in unity and how to move forward in a way that doesn't undermine the concrete workers.,76,,
413,0.97,3036.032,3039.603,The increasing cost for all the projects.,76,,
414,0.97,3039.603,3051.848,It is about $3 million a month increasing.,76,,
415,0.97,3051.848,3062.793,"So to the extent we can for one of the providers, for whom the workers have agreed to deliver their concrete, we can get them moving.",76,,
416,0.97,3062.793,3069.566,And that is something we all want to see happen.,76,,
417,0.97,3069.566,3070.1,Absolutely.,77,,
418,0.97,3070.1,3078.542,"And Council member Herbold, just to address your first question about the training and how pride intends to do that, I can't speak to that specifically.",78,,
419,0.97,3078.542,3117.981,"I would be happy to get in touch with Steven and their program people there to answer it more Holistically, but I think it has to do with the fact that this will be the first building of its kind in the Northwest and Gen pride has been targeting this I think it has to do with their history in doing this and being contacted by other smaller organizations who are trying to pro Vie similar services.",78,,
420,0.97,3117.981,3127.858,But I'm just taking a note here I will get a more complete answer for you and send that in the next couple of days if that is okay.,78,,
421,0.97,3127.858,3129.025,Thank you.,79,,
422,0.97,3129.025,3129.726,Sarah.,79,,
423,0.97,3129.726,3132.996,It is an area I'm keenly interested in.,79,,
424,0.97,3132.996,3145.008,"Often identified by the users of many of our human services, the need for providers to offer a culturally competent services to Lgbtq members of our community.",79,,
425,0.97,3145.008,3151.281,And it looks like you might be focused on housing providers.,79,,
426,0.97,3151.281,3169.733,"I would say if you are able to include providing these Trainings to providers of services for our home's population, that might be very, very useful and appreciated.",79,,
427,0.97,3169.733,3170.233,"Yes, well noted.",80,,
428,0.97,3170.233,3172.068,Thank you.,80,,
429,0.97,3172.068,3174.938,Are there any additional comments or questions?,81,,
430,0.97,3174.938,3177.707,Please go ahead Council member Nelson.,82,,
431,0.97,3177.707,3185.815,Thank you very much for this presentation.,83,,
432,0.97,3185.815,3187.05,This is a fabulous project.,83,,
433,0.97,3187.05,3208.071,"I don't remember Chris if it was you or someone else that was telling me when an affordable housing provider is building a project that the ground, the street level is tenant improvements and all that goes in there, whether or not it is the community space, however it is going to be.",83,,
434,0.97,3208.071,3226.289,"Can the office of housing funds be used for that ground-level or do all housing providers have to do the capital project for, is that a separate pot of money or in addition cost in addition to the housing on top that it has to be paid for?",83,,
435,0.97,3226.289,3229.359,"Yeah, I'll start and then I'm going to turn it over to Mace in so.",84,,
436,0.97,3229.359,3233.029,He is more the expert on this.,84,,
437,0.97,3233.029,3242.405,Generally our tax credit funding and housing funding is not allowed to support the development of the ground floor uses.,84,,
438,0.97,3242.405,3265.161,"There are some allowed uses for community purposes that can be in the, what we call the basis for the tax credit financing, for instance, in a different project the family project we are doing in partnership, the early childhood program is part of the basis.",84,,
439,0.97,3265.161,3268.565,And so it does get some tax credit financing.,84,,
440,0.97,3268.565,3275.338,"For Gen pride, I don't think any of the ground floor is in basis but I'm going to leave that to Mason to clarify.",84,,
441,0.97,3275.338,3275.605,Yeah.,85,,
442,0.97,3275.605,3276.906,"That's correct, Chris.",85,,
443,0.97,3276.906,3284.781,"Because we are not in a qualified census tract, we do not qualify for low income housing tax credit basis for the community center.",85,,
444,0.97,3284.781,3305.335,"I would also note that it is a function of zoning that we cannot have residential units along the ground-level along Broadway, and it is also a part of our acquisition agreement with sound transit and Seattle central college that we are required to have a commercial or community use space on the ground-level.",85,,
445,0.97,3305.335,3312.342,We do have a series of private loans and then the capital campaign that Kylie spoke about err to fund those spaces.,85,,
446,0.97,3312.342,3322.285,"But as of now, there is no money from the office of housing each those Nonresidential spaces.",85,,
447,0.97,3322.285,3323.153,Okay.,86,,
448,0.97,3323.153,3324.087,Thank you very much for that background.,86,,
449,0.97,3324.087,3331.795,I don't know enough about how what is allowed funding by the office of housing and I don't know if that is by law or what.,86,,
450,0.97,3331.795,3333.396,Thank you for this information.,86,,
451,0.97,3333.396,3336.733,Thank you so much.,87,,
452,0.97,3336.733,3350.447,"And for the team, but also especially for Mason if you do all the try to brave the funding is there any good news that came from Olympia from the last session that you want to highlight for us?",87,,
453,0.97,3350.447,3370.967,"Maybe more generally or any additional ask that you admit have of the city to complement some of that funding I don't well I think it is you know, obviously God that you know the state has signaled a willingness to provide more funding than previous years for the low income work force housing that we provide.",87,,
454,0.97,3370.967,3371.468,Which is great news.,87,,
455,0.97,3371.468,3377.907,It is a critical supplement oftentimes to the Funning we get from the office of housing.,87,,
456,0.97,3377.907,3383.246,And it enables us to provide deeper Affordability to our projects.,87,,
457,0.97,3383.246,3389.352,So we are able to offer more units with the additional state funding.,87,,
458,0.97,3389.352,3393.356,I think I'll also see if Chris has any thoughts.,87,,
459,0.97,3393.356,3397.827,I know he honors the legislative agenda as well.,87,,
460,0.97,3397.827,3398.595,Thank you.,88,,
461,0.97,3398.595,3420.25,"I'm going to pass that to Kylie and doing an end around here because I think Kylie can talk interest Bsome of the specific grants we have gotten for from project for the state and other project, really I don't very happy to share that.",89,,
462,0.97,3420.25,3435.331,"Thanks to leadership from representative Nicole Mack, we received or were included Gen pride was included for a half million dollars direct appropriation in the supplemental capital budget at the state level just this past session.",89,,
463,0.97,3435.331,3437.567,So it Isen Creditably Impactful.,89,,
464,0.97,3437.567,3444.107,At this point we have about $2 million in direct appropriations to support the Buildout of that senior center.,89,,
465,0.97,3444.107,3461.391,"And so, you know, Ening that is probably it in terms of what going to ask for in a direct appropriation from the state, about you that $2 million as you can imagine toward a $4.3 million goal is Impactful and helping us leverage private funding into the project as well.",89,,
466,0.97,3461.391,3475.104,"And then if I could just add kind of to I think Council member Nelson's point, I agree with the policy that housing dollars shouldn't be spent on Nonhousing uses.",90,,
467,0.97,3475.104,3494.958,"But it is very, very challenging developing affordable housing when you have to go through sort of Pretzel logic to fund the ground floor in the additional demand on mission based.",90,,
