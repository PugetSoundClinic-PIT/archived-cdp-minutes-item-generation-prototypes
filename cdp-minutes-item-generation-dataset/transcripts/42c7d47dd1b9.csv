48,0.97,424.557,431.264,Thank you so much.,13,,

50,0.97,446.913,460.126,Could we justly start off with a brief description of the community pollution police Commission of the work you do,13,,
51,0.97,460.126,460.526,Absolutely.,14,,
52,0.97,460.526,473.873,I am one of the three Cochairs and the CDC is one part of Seattle's three-part police Academy systems.,14,,
53,0.97,473.873,476.042,We are made up of commissioners that we are an independent.,14,,
54,0.97,476.042,496.128,"Our mission is to listen, amplify and build common ground on communities affected by Seattle policing and we were created in the wake of Seattle's Federal to consent decree, 2017, we have become a fixture in part of Seattle's police Academy systems.",14,,
55,0.97,496.128,511.777,"In terms of work in recent years, we have made recommendations to city Council, crowd control, advocating for police reform bill statewide and have continued to fulfill our oversight duties under the dissent consent decree.",14,,
56,0.97,511.777,517.45,"These two Cochairs, members of our Commission.",14,,
57,0.97,517.45,527.827,Catherine is one of our Cochairs . I am happy to answer any other questions.,14,,
58,0.97,527.827,551.284,"Spot before we go into any Reappointments, one of the questions I have about the future work of the CDC as it relates is how the dissent consent decree is going to be evolving.",14,,
59,0.97,551.284,567.233,"We are heading into a new year and there are lots of questions about whether or not we maintain compliance, what that means for the future of the dissent degree.",14,,
60,0.97,567.233,577.209,I know CDC has begun to have discussions with the consent decree.,14,,
61,0.97,577.209,580.746,Maybe not the content but what you're hoping to get out of them.,14,,
62,0.97,580.746,581.647,You.,15,,
63,0.97,581.647,604.57,The monitor is engaging in kind of an assessment of where the city is at with the consent degree and I think it is frankly laying the groundwork through that assessment of what an up close consent decree environment might look like Tuesday Seattle.,15,,
64,0.97,604.57,611.477,So we are teaming up on the monitor to current.,15,,
65,0.97,611.477,679.745,"Over the next several months, we will be engaged with that and doing a series of community meetings and outreach to ensure that there is a community perspective and the report that they develop and share with the judge who is overseeing that dissent conjure--while the city remained out of compliance, one key aspect of the consent degree, I think the reality is and what we are kind of sensing from the monitor is that, at some point, the consent decree is going to come to an end and there needs to be a plan put in place for what that means for the city, how police oversight and accountability will continue to strengthen beyond the consent decree . I think that is where we are going to engage in over the next couple of months.",15,,
66,0.97,679.745,682.148,That is super helpful.,16,,
67,0.97,682.148,695.061,"One other question I had about those conversations, we know that there has been a significant reduction of use of force incidents.",16,,
68,0.97,695.061,710.543,"But one of the areas that we often hear about and we see demonstrated is that there is still a very high disparity, Acial disparity in use of force.",16,,
69,0.97,710.543,729.495,And I am just wondering how the conversation does and that wasn't if I recall correctly was a finding but it is still a challenge for the Department and for the community that come into contact with police officers.,16,,
70,0.97,729.495,745.111,"So I am wondering, given that that's wasn't any sort of alluded to, they walked right up to, that being a finding but did not come back.",16,,
71,0.97,745.111,758.891,I'm curious to know how that issue might interplay in the discussions about the future of the consent decree or will it?,16,,
72,0.97,758.891,765.03,"I think that is going to be a main feature in addition to ongoing concerns about use of force, generally.",17,,
73,0.97,765.03,782.748,I think discontinuation of how it is going to be years is going to be a main feature in the coming months related to how that dissent can and and whether we have made enough progress.,17,,
74,0.97,782.748,794.393,"And I think beyond the data and statistics, I think the perception is also still of concern.",17,,
75,0.97,794.393,817.65,"I think if you ask people of color in the city, I am not sure that those folks would really sure that they feel like there has been this kind of monumental shifts in policing in terms of whether folks will say for whether they are confident that Seattle police are there to protect and serve them.",17,,
76,0.97,817.65,825.691,So I think the issue in addition to Disproportionality or use of force is still a major concern.,17,,
77,0.97,825.691,834.233,And one thing I am also hoping for the monitor is an additional analysis of use of force.,17,,
78,0.97,834.233,866.999,"I think we have all kind of relied on the report from the previous monitor which came out four or five years and which showed use of force Trending down but since then, we haven't seen kind of a conservative analysis of use of force in our use of force dashboard and taking a look at the dashboard, you can see that use of force is way up in 2020 as a result of the protest and engaging and hands-on with officers.",17,,
79,0.97,866.999,874.106,I think it is important to know where we are at and get an updated analysis of use of force.,17,,
80,0.97,874.106,877.543,The report is from four or five years ago and the data is kind of stale.,17,,
81,0.97,877.543,884.75,I appreciate your willingness to go off on that important trajectory.,18,,
82,0.97,884.75,910.309,"So now, I think we are just going to move into the [Indiscernible] of--[Indiscernible] [technical difficulties] counsel Reappointments [Indiscernible] on these individuals.",18,,
83,0.97,910.309,934.3,"The first appointment is Katherine Seibel . She works in policy advocacy, mental health, social and emotional learning, sexual abuse prevention at the multi state and Federal levels.",19,,

158,0.97,1603.635,1616.181,I just want to talk a little bit about if there are some particular accomplishments or initiatives that you want to work on during your tenure.,37,,
159,0.97,1616.181,1621.186,"I am excited about our strategic plan, really amplifying the mission of the Úpdh.",38,,

161,0.97,1627.092,1631.162,It was Online but still felt very connected.,38,,
162,0.97,1631.162,1639.604,I enjoyed that the Grantees are able to connect the dots and create more camaraderie and coalition building because it does take all of us.,38,,
163,0.97,1639.604,1642.674,It is about the Ecosystem.,38,,
164,0.97,1642.674,1658.356,"So that is something that I am looking forward to, to keep building upon and to really Upport a strong base of health justice workers, people in the community that they are serving, that they also have health, themselves.",38,,
165,0.97,1658.356,1672.27,So I think we are at this intersection where I am thinking about the services we are providing or the people providing the services having the same living standards they are trying to provide for others.,38,,
166,0.97,1672.27,1674.439,Looking at direct service but also how are we operating?,38,,
167,0.97,1674.439,1675.273,How is the field operating?,38,,
168,0.97,1675.273,1678.109,What can we do to raise the type for all ships?,38,,

176,0.97,1734.499,1772.804,And I really appreciate that they really showed up early in the budget process to help advocate for that and I think the synergy between that really quick critically important program and service to the community blends well with the opportunity to serve on the PDA and hope that is an opportunity to sort of learn and create a sustainable health center that is focused on the needs of our black residents throughout the city and the region.,40,,

210,0.97,1942.774,1956.087,Counsel bill 120 245 would update language related to the Seattle fire departments permitting and inspection services functions.,57,,
211,0.97,1956.087,1977.642,These functions are housed in the fire Marshal's office and probably support prevention through hazardous material storage and [technical difficulties]. This is what is often called a cleanup bill in the sense that it cleans up language to reflect the most current requirements and Practics.,57,,
212,0.97,1977.642,1978.943,The proposed legislation is the last step.,57,,
213,0.97,1978.943,1990.955,It begins with the International code Council updating its modern fire code.,57,,
214,0.97,1999.43,2002.934,This code is implemented at the state level along with any changes that are specific to Washington.,57,,
215,0.97,2002.934,2007.338,Fst then works with its fire code advisory board to draft SMC changes that incorporate those changes and any Seattle specific changes.,57,,
216,0.97,2007.338,2009.841,The changes to the fire code itself were adopted earlier this year.,57,,
217,0.97,2009.841,2016.981,"Ordinance 126238 is a bill before the committee, today, reflecting all necessary changes implied by that adoption and also includes a few Non-Substantive.",57,,
218,0.97,2016.981,2030.495,A version of this bill is often referred to as [Indiscernible] legislation but it was not because there are no proposed changes to permit or service fees financial impact.,57,,
219,0.97,2030.495,2040.004,"Staff list the notable changes in the bill, the one I would highlight, food trucks.",57,,
220,0.97,2040.004,2048.713,Recline these operators to pass a field inspection has an element of their applications and other cities have the same requirement.,57,,
221,0.97,2048.713,2061.192,"Earlier this year, Partnering with other fire departments on a new standardized approach to this inspection that will illuminate a hurdle for food truck park operators that operate in two or more jurisdictions.",57,,
222,0.97,2061.192,2064.295,The proposed changes address the new approach.,57,,
223,0.97,2064.295,2069.934,The bills proposed effective date is March 1 of 2022.,57,,
224,0.97,2069.934,2077.341,The proposed changes require updates in the system and time to perform and test the network.,57,,
225,0.97,2077.341,2079.944,Thank you.,58,,
226,0.97,2079.944,2084.015,And I believe we have a presentation here?,59,,
227,0.97,2084.015,2084.449,All right.,59,,
228,0.97,2084.449,2086.451,We do.,60,,
229,0.97,2086.451,2089.921,"Thank you, once again.",60,,
230,0.97,2089.921,2090.354,An amazing job.,60,,
231,0.97,2090.354,2093.157,I will kick it off.,60,,
232,0.97,2093.157,2097.462,"As you see the first slide, I'm going to talk quickly with the fire code is.",60,,
233,0.97,2097.462,2110.274,"The fire code as everybody knows, a very strict, very detailed item that we use in order to guide us.",60,,
234,0.97,2110.274,2115.98,"Behind-The-Scenes, it is one of those Behind-The-Scenes documents.",60,,
235,0.97,2115.98,2122.487,We know the Seattle the fire Department is responsible to keep people safe.,60,,
236,0.97,2122.487,2131.662,"Everybody has heard the chief talk about values and I want to let everybody know, the fire code, the fire code doesn't have feelings.",60,,
237,0.97,2131.662,2154.452,"It is a very strict guidance for us to keep people safe and I want everybody to know that the fire to pension prevention division, it is not always easy because we do have a responsibility to keep people safe.",60,,
238,0.97,2154.452,2157.321,The year has been tough on the entire city.,60,,
239,0.97,2157.321,2172.036,"The last couple of years, it has been extremely tough but I want everybody to know that the fire Department will always show compassionate service and patience with the community.",60,,
240,0.97,2172.036,2181.345,So I will kick it off to Karen to go over some of the specifics and we will be around for any questions.,60,,
241,0.97,2181.345,2196.193,"I am having a little bit of trouble getting the screens to lineup but I believe hour 2018 fire code and as you know, the codes are adopted about every three years, nationally.",61,,
242,0.97,2196.193,2202.533,States have the opportunity to amend the code further.,61,,
243,0.97,2202.533,2204.569,"In Washington state, that does happen.",61,,
244,0.97,2204.569,2207.371,Estate took effect in February.,61,,
245,0.97,2207.371,2209.574,We brought you further amendments to that.,61,,
246,0.97,2209.574,2221.986,"The local jurisdictions can amend the code to work for their communities, their businesses, their geography but it cannot be less strong than the national or state code.",61,,
247,0.97,2221.986,2241.305,"So instead of considerations you proved earlier accomplish that to the effect in the first quarter, coming along with some cleanup work, let me see if I can address or advance the next slide.",61,,
248,0.97,2241.305,2242.506,"Behind the scenes, I really apologize.",61,,
249,0.97,2242.506,2247.778,There is something about doing this through zoom that is interrupting.,61,,
250,0.97,2247.778,2257.722,There is something.,61,,
251,0.97,2257.722,2258.823,Okay.,61,,
252,0.97,2258.823,2273.537,"I wanted to let you know that the fire code is also advised to us by a fire code advisory board similar to some of the appointments you just enacted, today.",61,,
253,0.97,2273.537,2279.81,You have also been very helpful to us and we appreciate your support over the years.,61,,
254,0.97,2279.81,2283.447,It has been very helpful to us.,61,,
255,0.97,2283.447,2295.326,"Today, we are talking about Aligning the municipal code to the fire code and some of the services include permits.",61,,
256,0.97,2295.326,2299.964,We do about 6000 hazardous permits per year.,61,,
257,0.97,2299.964,2306.103,"That might be fishing boats from Alaska, Nitrous oxide from a dentist office or explosives in a warehouse.",61,,
258,0.97,2306.103,2327.124,We also do [Indiscernible] like discharging fireworks at a Seahawks game or reviewing a concert promoter and their concert strategy to event the kind of tragedy that happened at Astroworld earlier this year and we also do annual permitting.,61,,
259,0.97,2327.124,2340.204,"Churches, all of those places that bring a lot of people together and we do permit them and that gives us a chance to share safety conditions with them into education as well as enforcement, later.",61,,
260,0.97,2340.204,2342.873,"We also do about 50,000 inspections each year.",61,,
261,0.97,2342.873,2349.113,An example there would be about 6000 that are a part of the city's building process.,61,,
262,0.97,2349.113,2357.521,"On new construction and major Remodels, we are actually incorporated into that process.",61,,
263,0.97,2357.521,2362.126,Sd CIS Ann Gorman mentioned.,61,,
264,0.97,2362.126,2366.43,"And Behind-The-Scenes, we do about 6000 inspections each year.",61,,
265,0.97,2366.43,2369.5,And we also do about 1000 high- rise buildings each year.,61,,
266,0.97,2369.5,2373.537,We don't have a ton of changes to either permit.,61,,
267,0.97,2373.537,2378.542,I do have a slide about changing inspections.,61,,
268,0.97,2378.542,2388.018,Certification helps us know that the Sprinklers and fire alarms are safe in the city.,61,,
269,0.97,2388.018,2394.325,To train people to keep those pieces of equipment working and to keep people in the city safe.,61,,
270,0.97,2394.325,2399.23,And we do provide plan review services.,61,,
271,0.97,2399.23,2403.033,I mentioned the inspections we do.,61,,
272,0.97,2403.033,2414.245,"Before the building enters the construction dates, we also work with the building Department to review the plans and I gathered some statistics for you guys on plan review.",61,,
273,0.97,2414.245,2424.321,"We did about 3000 per year and that was 58,000 fire alarm devices and 150 sprinkler alarm devices.",61,,
274,0.97,2424.321,2434.198,It is quite a large body of work and we have a smooth a few small changes.,61,,
275,0.97,2434.198,2441.105,The work is partially funded and we usually bring in right around $9 million a year.,61,,
276,0.97,2441.105,2449.713,There has been some intentional and some matter of course reduction during the pandemic.,61,,
277,0.97,2449.713,2457.221,"What I mean by that, the city made a decision to reduce permitting fees.",61,,
278,0.97,2457.221,2469.834,"The restaurants you saw outside, we try to work with them through Covid to help them survive through government regulations making it hard for them to conduct business.",61,,
279,0.97,2469.834,2474.505,So wish me luck as I tried to advance this slide.,61,,
280,0.97,2474.505,2479.376,I want to give you a couple of examples of what the ordinance says.,61,,
281,0.97,2479.376,2489.353,The fire code introduces regulations around a lot of new technology so we do have a new permit that we are asking for your approval on to install Fuel-Cell power systems.,61,,
282,0.97,2489.353,2508.772,"This counsel as you know has passed regulations that prevent natural gas to power new buildings and, instead, to supplant and provided alternatives, buildings are starting to look at the power services and this is often hydrogen.",61,,
283,0.97,2508.772,2529.96,One of the reasons we are singing this ordinance doesn't have a lot of physical impact is because it is a very new technology and we don't expect to see any substantive activity in this but we do need to have the code framework set up as these new technologies come through.,61,,
284,0.97,2529.96,2534.632,And the permitting is our chance to work with them as they are doing it to get it installed safely.,61,,
285,0.97,2534.632,2540.871,Another example is our food truck permits.,61,,
286,0.97,2540.871,2556.387,"And you have probably seen in the news over the years that food trucks, because they use propane, unfortunately, they have explosions and their very often a lot of people around so it is a high hazard situation.",61,,
287,0.97,2556.387,2561.025,We in Seattle have actually been regulating the propane truck for a while.,61,,
288,0.97,2561.025,2584.148,"The model code in 2018 that just took effect in Washington state, this year, is actually now doing a food truck permits so what we are asking for your Upport on, we are going to update our food structure to allow for Nonmobile booths.",61,,
289,0.97,2584.148,2594.825,"And the mobile food trucks, we have a new permit that Aligns with a full set of regulations in the state of Washington code.",61,,
290,0.97,2594.825,2598.862,"On this, I want to say that this was one we spent a little extra time with.",61,,
291,0.97,2598.862,2611.275,"We heard from businesses, because they are mobile, they have an extensive permitting that they have to run and it becomes bureaucratic and expensive for them.",61,,
292,0.97,2611.275,2623.354,We also as a city looked at this and we realized this Inner- city has a very high percentage of immigrant owned businesses.,61,,
293,0.97,2623.354,2640.204,"So we together with some tremendous help from an immigrant affairs, we figured out how we were going to try to roll this new permit out in a manner that was accessible to all of the business owners.",61,,
294,0.97,2640.204,2664.428,"What this looks like is, we got together regionally about 20 jurisdictions in the area to agree on a set of minimum standards for an inspection and we agreed that regardless of which of our departments conducts the inspection, we will all mutually recognize it.",61,,
295,0.97,2664.428,2671.335,"And then, all of us are working with our city councils to allow for some type of a fee reduction.",61,,
296,0.97,2671.335,2679.243,"If somebody comes to us in Seattle with a rent inspection, we like to give them a fee reduction.",61,,
297,0.97,2679.243,2698.262,"So, we work regionally on that and we also were [Indiscernible] received guidance on the way we can best set business owners up for success making the expectation super clear.",61,,
298,0.97,2698.262,2705.669,But also really know how to pass it like what will we be looking for.,61,,
299,0.97,2705.669,2708.238,And we showed the translated materials.,61,,
300,0.97,2708.238,2714.344,Most of the small businesses don't have.,61,,
301,0.97,2714.344,2719.75,We were able to share those out regionally.,61,,
302,0.97,2719.75,2733.03,That is a look at what we have done behind the scenes to adopt the fire code and implement it.,61,,
303,0.97,2734.031,2769.9,"'s back on the food truck sort of streamlining the requirements of multiple jurisdictions that the food trucks moved through, given that I understand the permits fees are supposed to be associated with Recouping the costs associated with the work that the regulatory agency is doing, it is both helpful for the operator to have those costs reduced.",61,,
304,0.97,2769.9,2775.939,"As I understand it, these costs are not being reduced to the cost of the city.",61,,
305,0.97,2775.939,2791.188,Because there is less work being done to approve the permit if you have this sort of Standard Multi-Jurisdiction permitting approach and process.,61,,
306,0.97,2791.188,2793.457,Is that more or less correct?,61,,
307,0.97,2793.457,2795.192,Expect that is a really great summary.,61,,
308,0.97,2795.192,2803.667,"So the inspection associated with the permit approval, that is now a shared cost.",61,,
309,0.97,2803.667,2806.069,It is truly more efficient across the region.,61,,
310,0.97,2806.069,2811.975,"In Seattle, the bulk of the trucks really do work here.",61,,
