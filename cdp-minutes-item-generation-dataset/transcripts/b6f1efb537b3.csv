566,0.97,3801.33,3810.406,The new laws record extreme hardship and instability to the farming community to the advantage of large agricultural corporations.,146,,
567,0.97,3810.406,3822.952,This in turn will impact all of India with shortages created by an artificial market despite there being a supply of farm product.,146,,

594,0.97,4025.855,4034.13,Eventually the laws that are passed will allow major corporations to take away this land from farmers which is unjust and unfair.,152,,

789,0.97,5220.114,5238.466,An example of the work that this Council has done around funding sources that are of concern relate specifically to legislation in 2017 that the Council adopted.,245,,
790,0.97,5238.466,5255.483,You might remember that that year I proposed to create a new section of the municipal code prohibiting Seattle police Department participation in the U.S. Department of defense 1033 program.,245,,

792,0.97,5262.49,5287.682,This was a particular program that we had received concerns about and in response we--the chief had decided to no longer participate in that program and then we sort of solidified that policy decision of chief best with this particular ordinance.,245,,
793,0.97,5287.682,5330.358,I would suggest that our ongoing efforts to take a look at some of these grants sources might result in a request from the Council to the Department to no longer participate in some of these grant sources but that is important work and I appreciate that we need to do moving forward and I appreciate that we have a commitment from the budget director that we can take a deeper dive in the future before these grants are sought.,245,,

833,0.97,5449.143,5453.614,Will the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation on my behalf.,267,,
834,0.97,5453.614,5458.786,"Item 5, will the clerk please read the short title of item 5 into the record.",267,,
835,0.97,5458.786,5472.733,"Agenda item 5, council bill 119970 amending ordinance--adopted a 20 budget including the 2020 through 2025 capital improvement program.",268,,
836,0.97,5472.733,5474.969,The committee recommend the bill passes as amended.,268,,
837,0.97,5474.969,5475.336,Thank you.,269,,
838,0.97,5475.336,5479.74,You are recognized in order to provide the committee's report.,269,,
839,0.97,5479.74,5484.812,"Thank you very much, Madam President.",270,,
840,0.97,5484.812,5494.488,"Colleagues, this is the quarter for supplemental budget that AMENDS appropriations to various departments and budget control levels including the capital improvement projects.",270,,
841,0.97,5494.488,5502.663,This is Ideally intended to be a bill that Trues up any additional costs and helps to tie up any loose ends before the calendar year concludes.,270,,
842,0.97,5502.663,5507.802,This helps to ensure that there is a balanced budget at the end of each year.,270,,
843,0.97,5507.802,5509.871,Ideally quarter 4 is to be technical in nature.,270,,
844,0.97,5509.871,5518.379,"However, the proposal that we received this year from the Mayor included a request for SPD for an additional spending of authority.",270,,
845,0.97,5518.379,5537.431,"The Council, as you know, this summer passed a resolution that tied to our summer budgeting process stated the following: the city council will not support any budget amendments to increase SPD's budget to offset overtime expenditures above the funds budgeted in 2020 and 2021.",270,,
846,0.97,5537.431,5558.219,"So Councilmember Herbold, as vice chair of the budget committee and Finance Committee and myself, we have introduced an amendment to do just that, to hold the line, to make sure there are consequences for an Overspend which is a managerial decision and to make sure that we are looking across these two budgets to accomplish the goals in the resolution.",270,,
847,0.97,5558.219,5578.272,"This is accomplished both by the amendment that is included in this bill for your consideration today, again, thank you Council colleagues who were part of the Finance and housing Committee who included this amendment and is also be accomplished by the bill on the introduction and referral calendar today sponsored by Councilmember Herbold and myself which I discussed this morning.",270,,
848,0.97,5578.272,5591.485,"Madam President, if it pleases the President, I would like to defer to vice chair Herbold to offer this and offer comments and closing before the vote if that pleases the President.",270,,
849,0.97,5591.485,5593.354,Absolutely.,271,,
850,0.97,5593.354,5594.255,Herbold wants to go next.,271,,
851,0.97,5594.255,5597.758,Councilmember Mosqueda you will have the last word on the bill as we close the debate.,271,,
852,0.97,5597.758,5600.628,But for now let's hear from Councilmember Herbold.,271,,
853,0.97,5600.628,5609.503,"If anyone else would like to make comments on this particular bill, please do let me know.",271,,
854,0.97,5609.503,5616.043,"Councilmember Herbold, then followed by Councilmember Sawant and then Councilmember Strauss.",271,,
855,0.97,5616.043,5623.618,"As Councilmember Mosqueda mentioned, we are Co-Sponsoring an amendment that insures that the budget process never ends.",272,,
856,0.97,5623.618,5624.752,Yeah.,272,,
857,0.97,5624.752,5641.569,So this amendment as the new section 13 expressing Council's intent to take additional action in 2021 to reduce the police Department's 2021 appropriation authority by at least five on .4 million.,272,,
858,0.97,5641.569,5653.614,This is in the referral calendar with 90 Council bill 119981 and it's going to be referred to the public safety and human services committee early next year.,272,,
859,0.97,5653.614,5672.133,"As Councilmember Mosqueda mentioned, passed by the Council in August, we made a statement that the city council would not support any budget amendments to increase the police Department's budget to offset overtime expenditures.",272,,
860,0.97,5672.133,5690.518,We expressed the Council's intent to reduce the police Department's budget in phases and increase funding for community led research and par Tiss Pa tore budgeting.,272,,
861,0.97,5690.518,5698.959,"Total $5.4 million, and there are three items that make up that make up the $5.4 million.",272,,
862,0.97,5698.959,5722.883,"1.6 for separation pay, 1.9 million for FEMA reimbursement and that is specifically overtime associated with police officers who are staffing some of our Covid testing sites and so there's an anticipation that there will be FEMA reimbursement for these costs.",272,,
863,0.97,5722.883,5725.252,And 1.9 million for parental leave.,272,,
864,0.97,5725.252,5741.368,"The connection to overtime for that one is when officers go on parental leave, the Department cannot simply hire new officers to fill in for that short period of time and that's had when they bring folks on overtime.",272,,
865,0.97,5741.368,5747.141,Each of these is connected to use of overtime and Backfilling work.,272,,
866,0.97,5747.141,5765.426,"As I stated in Committee, last week, I don't see myself as a person even given the statement that was in the Council resolution about overtime and the intent to not increase funding for overtime.",272,,
867,0.97,5765.426,5796.39,"I might have been willing to consider some additional overtime if it wasn't for the fact that I do believe that there is still a lot of work that the Department needs to be doing in real time to address the allocation of overtime, not connected to the three items that I mentioned earlier.",272,,
868,0.97,5796.39,5807.368,"But really overtime connected to staffing the protests that we have been seeing for many, many months now.",272,,
869,0.97,5807.368,5846.874,"We are still seeing large numbers of officers deployed for very small numbers of protesters and I want to just make note that back on October 31st chief Diaz announced, via the SPD Blogger that SPD was changing its approach to demonstrations including, I quote, recognizing that the visible presence in appearance of officers at a demonstration can impact crowds--can impact interactions with the crowd and that reducing the Department's presence when safe and feasible was a goal.",272,,
870,0.97,5846.874,5866.393,"And I applaud that stated changed approach demonstrations, but in just five days after this statement went out on November 4TH, on Capitol Hill, there appeared to be what looked like almost 100 officers present at a demonstration of 20 to 30 people.",272,,
871,0.97,5866.393,5880.04,We heard public comment last week in the Finance and neighborhoods committee that even last week large numbers of officers are continuing to show up at protests of small groups.,272,,
872,0.97,5880.04,5889.25,"So I recognize that over time management reports are being sent to all Bureau Chiefs, sworn commanders and civilian managers every month.",272,,
873,0.97,5889.25,5896.123,And that these reports contain detailed information for all employees who work overtime in the prior month.,272,,
874,0.97,5896.123,5904.131,But I think we need to not just review the overtime after it's approved.,272,,
875,0.97,5904.131,5910.304,We need to be really looking at the decision making associated with the approval.,272,,
876,0.97,5910.304,5923.45,We know also that the budget director receives monthly overtime reports and has throughout the summer and I think is also in a position to do more to control overtime.,272,,
877,0.97,5923.45,5931.659,I want to note that on a broader level part of the problem is that the Council has not received regular ongoing updates about SPD spending.,272,,
878,0.97,5931.659,5943.871,"And that's why these type of End-Of-Year spending bills are common and so to bridge this information gap, the Council adopted two actions in adopting the 2021 budget.",272,,
879,0.97,5943.871,5956.483,"First of all, we are going to be requesting--we are going to be receiving--we requested, we are going to be receiving monthly reporting on overtime use.",272,,
880,0.97,5956.483,5974.702,And that will allow the Council to really keep an eye on how overtime is being deployed in than effort to do necessary course correction in future deployment of overtime.,272,,
881,0.97,5974.702,5984.144,Secondly the Council has requested that SPD provide monthly fiscal reporting beginning in January 2021.,272,,
882,0.97,5984.144,6008.268,"This request made during the summer supplemental process, and, you know, I think again we are going to be looking on a monthly basis the spending of the larger overall spending of the Department as well as for the Department.",272,,
883,0.97,6008.268,6051.979,"We also need to think about what our expectations are to reduce the 2021 budget authority beyond--beyond this action here today to consider what specifics we might need to really focus on in these monthly reports, whether or not that's total spending to date by budget control level and I look forward to working with Councilmembers and central staff--receive it in a way that will make it most usable.",272,,
884,0.97,6051.979,6053.68,Thank you.,272,,
885,0.97,6053.68,6055.382,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",273,,
886,0.97,6055.382,6060.888,I have Councilmember Sawant and then Councilmember Morales.,273,,
887,0.97,6060.888,6065.692,I will be voting no on the supplemental budget which gives Seattle --,274,,
888,0.97,6065.692,6069.63,"Sawant, it's hard to hear you.",275,,
889,0.97,6069.63,6069.93,Sorry.,276,,
890,0.97,6069.93,6070.13,Okay.,276,,
891,0.97,6070.13,6070.497,Is that better?,276,,
892,0.97,6070.497,6070.764,Yes.,277,,
893,0.97,6070.764,6072.666,We can hear you now.,277,,
894,0.97,6072.666,6073.434,Thank you.,278,,
895,0.97,6073.434,6089.216,"I will be voting no on the supplemental budget which gives the Seattle police Department an additional $5.4 million to fund the extra overtime that they have used, abusing and Intimidating the ""black lives matter"" movement.",278,,
896,0.97,6089.216,6094.555,Every city Department is allocated a budget at the beginning of the year and those are the funds they have available to do whatever they need to do.,278,,
897,0.97,6094.555,6113.106,"Here we are in the last Council Meetingof the year, the same year we had a historic ""black lives matter"" movement, a year in which under pressure from the street heat the Democratic establishment made sweeping by 50%.",278,,
898,0.97,6113.106,6126.153,"Police spent $5.4 million more than their budget, $5.4 million that did not belong to them and they are requesting retroactive permission for these millions in taxpayer money that they have stolen.",278,,
899,0.97,6126.153,6143.67,"They have taken this money in order to abuse the ""black lives matter"" movement, spending millions in overtime to fill the streets of Seattle with tear gas and other weapons and they have taken this money for personal enrichment with individual officers amassing hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime pay.",278,,
900,0.97,6143.67,6151.912,"Imagine a car thief who tells you that if you just retroactively give them your car, then they will not have stolen it.",278,,
901,0.97,6151.912,6163.957,"And the Seattle police Department does this almost every year to the point where the Council even passed a resolution in the summer which was mentioned alleging to say, no, if the police make this request at the end of this year.",278,,
902,0.97,6163.957,6164.658,Now is the test.,278,,
903,0.97,6164.658,6172.799,Will Councilmembers hold the line or yet again Backfill the already bloated police budget with renewed pledges to hold the line next year?,278,,
904,0.97,6172.799,6183.343,"Unfortunately in the Finance and housing committee last week, Councilmembers and the committee unanimously voted to approve this police funding this year while pledging to take it from next year's Úbudget.",278,,
905,0.97,6183.343,6190.617,But what does it mean to take the money from next year's budget if Councilmembers prove that they have no intention of holding the police to that budget?,278,,
906,0.97,6190.617,6195.789,What if the police go over their budget by $5.4 million again in 2021?,278,,
907,0.97,6195.789,6199.76,Will the Council hold the line then or push it back another year.,278,,
908,0.97,6199.76,6205.098,What if they go over by 20 million in 2021 or 15 million?,278,,
909,0.97,6205.098,6224.184,"What will make the Councilmembers more willing to hold the police to their budget next year given that this year the Council already took the extra step of passing a resolution, a year in which we had the largest Street mobilization in U.S. history pledging to hold them to their budget.",278,,
910,0.97,6224.184,6231.625,"Does the Council need to pass two resolutions in 2021 saying, no, but for real this time?",278,,
911,0.97,6231.625,6237.598,In committee public comment community organizers demanded the Council Quote/Unquote hold the line.,278,,
912,0.97,6237.598,6244.204,It is moving the line back a year with no guarantee that it will not move again and again and again.,278,,
913,0.97,6244.204,6252.079,Of course the reality is it's not about lines or promises or resolutions or even the goodwill of elected officials.,278,,
914,0.97,6252.079,6254.448,It's about the power of the movements on the streets.,278,,
915,0.97,6254.448,6260.253,At the highest of the justice for George Floyd movement Councilmembers promised to Defund the police by 50%.,278,,
916,0.97,6260.253,6271.431,A couple of months later that was reduced to just a couple percent and a promise not to add that funding back at the end of the year and a couple of months later here we are.,278,,
917,0.97,6271.431,6276.503,The lesson for our movement is we must depend on our own strength always.,278,,
918,0.97,6276.503,6287.881,We have seen also how with the receding of the street movement the city council Democrats just approved nearly $200 million in cuts to other departments like housing and community services.,278,,
919,0.97,6287.881,6292.919,I want to raise one additional part of the supplemental budget that is Insisious.,278,,
920,0.97,6292.919,6294.154,There is funding from the U.S.,278,,
921,0.97,6294.154,6298.525,Department of homeland security to fund something called a fusion center.,278,,
922,0.97,6298.525,6302.763,I voted no on supplemental budgets in the past because of the fusion center funding.,278,,
923,0.97,6302.763,6315.909,"The fusion center is the place where the Seattle police and the FBI share information about protesters so that protest movements like ""black lives matter"" can be charged with Federal crimes.",278,,
924,0.97,6315.909,6321.081,It was similarly used against the Antiwar movement at the height of the Iraq war so this is nothing new.,278,,
925,0.97,6321.081,6327.054,I will be voting no.,278,,
926,0.97,6327.054,6327.788,Thank you.,278,,
927,0.97,6327.788,6328.889,Thank you.,279,,
928,0.97,6328.889,6339.433,Next up is Councilmember Morales and then is there anyone else who would like to make comments on this bill?,279,,
929,0.97,6339.433,6350.477,"Councilmember Morales and then it doesn't look--I haven't seen anything that they want to--if that remains the case, we will have Councilmember Mosqueda close out debate.",279,,
930,0.97,6350.477,6350.977,Councilmember Morales.,279,,
931,0.97,6350.977,6351.345,Thank you.,280,,
932,0.97,6351.345,6356.216,I am going to be honest and say I am very Conflicted on this bill.,280,,
933,0.97,6356.216,6373.433,"You know, I understand there are many departments that need to have their year-end items covered and I do want to thank Councilmember Herbold for walking us through all of the measures that we passed in order to help us keep closer tabs on the SPD budget from now on.",280,,
934,0.97,6373.433,6383.844,And I also want to be really clear that I don't support the notion of recovering SPD overtime even if we are reducing authority next year.,280,,
935,0.97,6383.844,6398.558,I really think it is outrageous is that SPD continues to disregard this legislative body and the efforts made to rein in their overtime expenses.,280,,
936,0.97,6398.558,6412.572,"Despite this body's expressing its intent over two budget processes this year, the interim chief submitted a request to cover additional overtime for activities that Judge Jones has deemed out of compliance with our accountability measures.",280,,
937,0.97,6412.572,6427.287,"If any other Department manager had Overspent their budget by $5 million, especially on any activities that a judge has deemed in contempt of court, we would not hesitate to hold them accountable.",280,,
938,0.97,6427.287,6433.96,So I am as frustrated as I know all of my colleagues are on this issue.,280,,
939,0.97,6433.96,6445.439,"If nothing else, it demonstrates to me that our search for a new police chief will need to include a thorough Vetting of their financial management skills and their commitment to a reduced role for police in our community safety.",280,,
940,0.97,6445.439,6485.912,"As I said, I understand that there are other departments whose year end work is sort of in the balance here so I am Conflicted and frankly not prepared yet to figure out what I'm going to do but I do want to express my frustration with this continued problem and my hope is that the measures that we have passed will allow us to be in a very different position next year.",280,,
941,0.97,6485.912,6486.746,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",281,,
942,0.97,6486.746,6487.447,Just checking in one more time.,281,,
943,0.97,6487.447,6492.018,Anyone else have any comments on the bill?,281,,
944,0.97,6492.018,6507.2,"Hearing no additional comments on this bill, Councilmember Mosqueda I'm going to hand it over to you to close out debate with some financial remarks.",281,,
945,0.97,6507.2,6508.702,Thank you very much.,282,,
946,0.97,6508.702,6512.939,"Councilmember Morales, I'll pick up on the last comments that you made.",282,,
947,0.97,6512.939,6516.276,I am too also Conflicted by this.,282,,
948,0.97,6516.276,6519.779,Wanted to bring forward an amendment last week that would have stripped these pieces.,282,,
949,0.97,6519.779,6538.798,"We heard loud and clear from the law Department and the executives team that the funds that are being basically held back that are needed for this allocation include things like paying for leave, federally reimbursement expenses for emergencies and separation pay.",282,,
950,0.97,6538.798,6540.867,But those were managerial decisions.,282,,
951,0.97,6540.867,6542.068,Those could have been paid first.,282,,
952,0.97,6542.068,6546.873,"Instead overtime was paid first, then Council was asked to basically fill the coffers.",282,,
953,0.97,6546.873,6592.319,"So in lieu of us having additional tools in the last week here of the 2020 cycle, the amendment that Councilmember Herbold and myself introduced on Wednesday, which clearly Articulates our frustration and concern with this process and the amendment coupled with the piece of legislation introduced today effective immediately in 2021 we will be able to if acted upon reduce the 2021 SPD budget by the proportional amount because if the tools we have at our disposal limit us and do not allow for us in theory to be able to hold back on that $5.4 million then it needs to be taken out of the 2021 budget.",282,,

955,0.97,6597.891,6618.645,"The Council has reason to believe that SPD would have sufficient appropriation authority to cover the 5.4 million had it not Overspent its overtime budget due largely to Overdeployment of officers during the largely peaceful protests in the summer of 2020, including the deployment of officers that exceeded $10 million in overtime costs in less than 60 days.",282,,
956,0.97,6618.645,6640.467,"Specifically examples of the type of response that we saw during those days included an unarmed elderly person with a cane being pepper sprayed and slammed down to the ground by an officer, an 8-year-old child getting pepper sprayed in the face, a bike cop literally riding over a person's neck and an officer putting their knee on someone's neck.",282,,
957,0.97,6640.467,6693.053,"We also heard as Councilmember Herbold talked about, the large number of officers who continued to be deployed to respond to a relatively small number of individuals over the last few months and this seems to be in contradiction to what we had heard from our police accountability partners, specifically Mr.--who talked in his summary in Councilmember Herbold's committee about how the sheer presence and the type of force that was being shown in response to the protest was escalating situations and the recommendation that if it were scaled down and officers were to be responding in different ways and in smaller force, then there would be less of a need for that type of response from the officers and I think that the lack of follow-through on that recommendation continue to escalate the costs.",282,,
958,0.97,6693.053,6717.777,The legislation also says the Council anticipates there will be salary savings on SPD's budget to achieve--achieved in 2021 due to higher than anticipated attrition which--in October and as I know this morning we found out on Wednesday is occurring as well and the numbers we are receiving in November and we anticipate that that trend will continue in 2020 for December as well.,282,,
959,0.97,6717.777,6735.395,The amendment commits to and the bill follows through on that commitment to reduce SPD's 2021 apportion authority offsetting the increased authority provided in 2020 and make sure we are increasing the funding--called four in resolution 31962.,282,,
960,0.97,6735.395,6739.766,This is the tool that we have at our disposal right now in this moment to hold the line.,282,,
961,0.97,6739.766,6765.024,"This is how we are making sure that there are consequences for overspending the authority already authorized in the budget and I equate this to going to a bank for those who have been able to purchase a home or for even those more than half of Seattle residents who are renting, you wouldn't go and purchase something that you didn't have the funding to buy and then go to the bank later and say, oops, I Overspent.",282,,
962,0.97,6765.024,6765.558,That wouldn't fly there.,282,,
963,0.97,6765.558,6785.779,It's not flying for other departments and we have to use the tools that Councilmember Herbold commented on and I talked about in the last committee meeting as well to have even more specific language in each cell and each line item in our budget so we have greater understanding and control over how these dollars are being spent.,282,,
964,0.97,6785.779,6786.713,This is parted of the story.,282,,
965,0.97,6786.713,6808.468,This is part of the narrative in the wake of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor's murder in making sure that we as a Council for the budgetary documents that we have control over in the wake of those murders have made sure that we are not only not increasing but we are now holding the line across 2020 and 2021.,282,,
966,0.97,6808.468,6813.339,So it's not a matter of saying this will be dealt with next December.,282,,
967,0.97,6813.339,6814.707,The bill has already been introduced.,282,,
968,0.97,6814.707,6817.343,It will be heard in early January.,282,,
969,0.97,6817.343,6829.522,I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for her foresight to request regular reports and I think this gives us all an opportunity to think about the type of information that we would like to be seeing on a Monhly basis as those reports come in.,282,,
970,0.97,6829.522,6837.797,So that we and any future Council is never in this position again and that we have greater transparency not just for our budget making process but for the city at large.,282,,
971,0.97,6837.797,6877.237,"I look forward to working with all of you over the next year to make sure that we have greater tools at our disposal to continue to hold the line and continue to move forward on our efforts to expose and have greater accountability, transparency and further scrutinize the spending so that on the managerial side, which Council has a responsibility for as well, we don't continue to see Overallocation of overtime funding and that we expect all departments to stay within those budgets, especially, though, our Seattle police Department's budget and the aftermath of our SPD request that we latched this summer.",282,,
972,0.97,6877.237,6889.849,I appreciate we have had a long conversation on this at today's meeting and in last Wednesday's meeting and I do also want to reiterate to folks there are a number of other important technical fixes and items within the sup minute.,282,,
973,0.97,6889.849,6907.767,It's not all about that but we did I think for good reason want to spend quite a bit of time explaining to the Council and the --,282,,

1004,0.97,7443.969,7499.625,"But between my maternity leave and responding to multiple crises that is 2020, it has been sometime before we could take this bill up, so this bill has been in the Queue for approximately one year now, it had been the hope of the--that this bill would have actually passed last year or the early part of this year so that they could spend most of the year implementing and doing outreach on this bill, but as it may we are here now and have the opportunity to take this bill up, I do take a lot of pride in our government and transparency measures, and the city of Seattle, however our lobbying regulations, this is one area where we can see some improvement.",295,,
1005,0.97,7499.625,7521.447,-- noted at committee last week that absent these regulations there has been a large amount of money being leveraged to lobby and influence legislation on September 30 first--September 21--and we still do not know who is behind this effort to influence city policy.,295,,
1006,0.97,7521.447,7531.757,That is related to indirect lobbying in particular.,295,,
1007,0.97,7531.757,7544.97,If this were a traditional campaign or candidate we would have transparency and disclosure of requirements so this has long been a gray area without any transparency and I believe very strongly that it is time to bring transparency to that area of our lobbying regulation and work that happens.,295,,
1008,0.97,7544.97,7556.282,I believe that this legislation is good for transparency of the who and the resources that is being used to influence policy or investments or Divestments across the city.,295,,
1009,0.97,7556.282,7578.437,"It brings us into alignment with disclosure requirements at the state level, there are three parts of this bill, and with my amendment, it would clarify membership communications to address any potential concerns related to how organizations communicate directly with their members.",295,,
1010,0.97,7578.437,7633.158,"I want to thank--and all of his team for bringing this legislation forward for Council's consideration before the end of this year, and this bill effectively does three things, the first thing is it would require disclosure of lobbying communications between lobbyists and Department directors and deputy directors or their direct reports, it would also require that lobbyists disclose any financial relationships or other relationships they may have with political campaigns, whether it be for elected officials or for ballot measures, and Lastly, the last piece is related to indirect lobbying which would require sponsors, I.E.",295,,
1011,0.97,7633.158,7738.497,"People or organizations who are paying for the indirect lobbying, not the people who are actually engaging in the lobbying, not members of the public, but those sponsors who are effectively footing the bill to encourage members of the public to lobby Councilmembers for a particular position, it would require those sponsors who spend $750 in one month or $1300 in a period of three months to file disclosures with--to disclose both those lobbying efforts, and funding sources and also the expenditures that they have made in that area, I am happy to address my amendment in particular that would again make this Council bill more consistent with the States law on lobbying activities by exempting internal membership communications so functionally what that would mean is if you are a member of an organization sending an Email about an issue or action to another member of your organization that activity would not be counted as part of activities that would require disclosure to Seattle ethics and elections Commission, so the amendment that we were considering in a moment does not currently define what membership is by design, but--and further community input to better define what membership means.",295,,
1012,0.97,7738.497,7779.138,"Last I will just end by saying--and asking lots of really good questions including the Seattle human services collision who flagged some concerns for us last week and gave us a very long list of questions to answer that we were able to answer, my understanding is the membership exemption--we will be considering later as part of this legislation does address the concerns by the--at least a little bit.",295,,
1013,0.97,7779.138,7788.714,"I will end my remarks there, and I am happy to now call for any additional comments.",295,,
1014,0.97,7788.714,7798.624,Actually I think what I have to do now is we have to consider the amendments first according to my script.,295,,
1015,0.97,7798.624,7816.642,"So we are going to go ahead and do that . I move, I am sorry, I am now going to acknowledge Councilmember Sawant who I understand has an amendment.",295,,
1016,0.97,7816.642,7827.085,I move amendment one--removing the restrictions on grassroots organizing --,296,,
1017,0.97,7845.904,7868.293,"This is not lobbying, this is not professional lobbyists paid to talk to elected officials, this is grassroots--the role requires any grassroots campaign that spends at least $750 in a month to have to disclose its expenditures donors and aims.",297,,
1018,0.97,7868.293,7872.397,In my view this turns transparency on its head.,297,,
1019,0.97,7872.397,7899.424,When I think of transparency I think that--essentially this is the political establishment demanding to know all of--or any small group of ordinary people or movement making demands on elected officials in committee Councilmembers even complain that they get contacted by the public and they do not know who to blame.,297,,
1020,0.97,7899.424,7918.41,"-- cited correctly when she said that she and the 350 Seattle leadership are all equally aghast at this attempt, and so I am also, I share those concerned I am equally concerned that this will create a chilling effect on grassroots organizing.",297,,
1021,0.97,7918.41,7941.166,"It will be easier for corporate advertising campaigns, but for genuine grassroots movements that will not have professional accountants or treasurers, this paperwork will become frankly impossible.",297,,
1022,0.97,7941.166,7956.481,"Imagine if this legislation was on the books during the justice for George light protest, during those protests hundreds or even thousands of people donating too many community organizations, organizing marches and making demands like the city council should Defund the police, renting a sound system for a single rally can cost more than $750 depending on the size of the protest.",297,,
1023,0.97,7956.481,7963.789,This puts protest organizers in an impossible position.,297,,
1024,0.97,7963.789,7975.934,It is technically impossible to track down everyone who--it requires that to make him become the major focus of organizers who should be spending their energy on the rally itself.,297,,
1025,0.97,7975.934,7991.049,It is not the intention of--but the enforcement of these regulations would largely be complaint based much like other S.E.C.,297,,
1026,0.97,7991.049,8021.046,Regulations and I guarantee that there are plenty of Trumper's borders Trump supporters and--my office has talked about this legislation with--I appreciate his time walking us through it but the reality is there are several questions that have no answer yet but they are really fundamental in the impact of this legislation on genuine grassroots campaigns.,297,,
1027,0.97,8021.046,8025.117,"If there is a protest on an issue, at what point does it meet the definition of grassroots lobbying?",297,,
1028,0.97,8025.117,8031.99,If it is all about a specific ill it should be straightforward but what is an issue like Defund the police or black lives matter generally?,297,,
1029,0.97,8031.99,8058.784,"-- movements grow organically, there is no clear start moment for campaign staff to be trained by the S.E.C., so how will volunteer organizers be made aware of their responsibilities, how should volunteers track donations thrown in buckets which is a common strategy for grassroots fundraising?",297,,
1030,0.97,8058.784,8114.94,"There are no answers to any of these questions yet, and I understand the concepts--but the sad reality is that it will create a chilling effect on community organizing by Burying them in red tape and the disclosure will be easy for those of the corporations who already have accountants and attorneys who make it trivial for them to complete the paperwork and it will be the volunteer organizers who will be penalized, and thirdly I understand that this language has been taken almost word for word from the state laws regulating grassroots campaigns started in the state government however the state regulations are the last place I would look for--Olympia is notoriously--I think this is emblematic of that problem.",297,,
1031,0.97,8114.94,8127.719,"The amendment my office has prepared, and I think central staff for getting it ready rapidly would cut from the bill the entire section on grassroots campaigns and would leave the other two issues taken up by the bill unchanged.",297,,
1032,0.97,8127.719,8145.237,"If this amendment fails I will be voting no on the bill as a whole not because I object to these other two issues but because unbalanced without this amendment, the bill would be an attack on grassroots organizing and would not unbalanced benefit ordinary people.",297,,
1033,0.97,8145.237,8157.983,"We need to be clear, mass movements have been the source of every progressive change in the history of this country including the recent developments like the $15 minimum wage and the Amazon tax.",297,,
1034,0.97,8157.983,8183.175,"I am not surprised that the political establishment is so eager to gather the information of grassroots organizers--Council President Gonzalez spoke to this, she said that this does not affect people who call in or Emailed the Council, it only affects organizers.",297,,
1035,0.97,8183.175,8209.134,"Because our movements are only successful when we get organized, it is as simple as that, the Council is saying you are fine if you call as individuals which has almost zero impact on political outcomes but if you succeed at getting organized enough to be effective, then the political establishment wants to know who you are and what you are doing.",297,,
1036,0.97,8209.134,8211.836,I think we need to understand that that is what is going on.,297,,
1037,0.97,8211.836,8221.346,Finally socialists and Rank-And- file labor should remember the McCarthy era and the Blacklist.,297,,
1038,0.97,8221.346,8252.21,"This has been throughout history used again and again to attack the mass movement of regular people, and this will be just another step toward creating hindrances to grassroots organizing in critical movements--if this amendment fails I will be voting no on the bill as a whole.",297,,
1039,0.97,8252.21,8259.718,Any additional comments on amendment one?,298,,
1040,0.97,8259.718,8400.859,"I would just say really quickly that I do oppose amendment one, and I think that it is unfortunate that there has been such a Mischaracterization of what the indirect lobbying portion of the underlying bill actually does, there is nothing in the Council bill that is before the city council that would in any way shape or form lead a reasonable person to conclude that folks who engage in protest movement organizing, protest movements or organizing would suddenly become lobbyists under this particular legislation, I think the bill is pretty clear in defining who a lobbyist is, it talks about how a lobbying--it defines a lobbyist as any individual who lobbies for compensation, except individuals who might be reimbursed for minor incidental personal expenses related to that lobbying, it defines a lobbyist employer as any employer who compensates--so again this particular legislation is specifically targeted toward those individuals who are professional lobbyists, there is nothing in this bill that targets organizers as we know them to be, in fact, this simply says that if there is a lobbyist who is compensated for the lobbying activity, and those lobbyists are sponsoring public campaigns to influence legislation at the city council or at the city as a whole, whether through direct communication to Councilmembers indirect communication to Councilmembers or the mayors office or the directors Department directors or those deputy directors, then they are simply required to disclose that activity and their expenditures related to those activities.",298,,
1041,0.97,8400.859,8459.184,"Again, we are taking a careful approach here through amendment two, which we will discuss if this amendment fails, if this amendment passes, then amendment two will not be on the table because amendment to would amend the indirect portion of the bill as passed out of committee, but amendment to makes this very clear that it does not cover any communications from organizations to their members, and that was an important amendment to respond to concerns from nonprofit organizations and other small organizations who do not want to be put in a position and should not be put in a position to have to communicate, to have to disclose every time you send out an Email blast for example to their member list.",298,,
1042,0.97,8459.184,8477.101,"Around a particular issue, so I will go ahead and Okay, sorry, go ahead Councilmember Mosqueda.",298,,
1043,0.97,8477.101,8506.631,"I did abstain on this vote in Committee, and I think that the concerns that I had our addressed by the amendment your office is bringing forward to address the underlying concern about the engagement with various members, and each of the grass roots lobbying and--can clearly see that that is not only permitted activity, but encouraged as we seek to get information directly from individuals affected by policy decisions.",299,,
1044,0.97,8506.631,8521.379,"Thank you for bringing forward your amendment because that is being brought forward today I am not going to be supporting this amendment that we are currently discussing but will be discussing your amendment to your bill and that addresses my concerns, thank you.",299,,

1050,0.97,8610.935,8628.086,I will now move to amend Council bill 11968 as presented which was recently distributed.,302,,
1051,0.97,8628.086,8679.804,"It has been moved and Seconded to amend the bill as presented on amendment two, as sponsor of this amendment, I will go ahead and just Recap really quickly because I know we have been discussing it, what it does, so amendment to would make Council bill 119968 more consistent with the States law on lobbying activities by exempting internal membership communications and again this amendment, with this amendment,--will be Tasked with a public process of defining membership this can look like a number of things like dues paying, Úelecting leadership, and by no being prescriptive in the legislation at this moment we will allow--some flexibility in how they define this in their Rulemaking process with the benefit of having public input.",302,,
1052,0.97,8679.804,8776.0,"Again colleagues, I think that amendment to, it does address some of the concerns that we heard through additional engagement and conversation in committee through how organizations who have memberships are going to be able to continue to communicate with those members without being subjected to cumbersome disclosure requirements in the new lobbying regulations, I do believe that this amendment does address those concerns with the understanding that there will be a period of six months in 2021 where the Seattle ethics and election Commission is going to engage in public education and additional community public input process is, and director Barnett indicated to us in committee that they are looking at taking a compliance first approach here, so they are not looking to have this be a Gotcha type of legislation, they want to encourage compliance and educate folks in how to comply, and that is the approach they are going to take as they go through initially implementing this particular component of the bill, so with that being said, I would strongly encourage folks to support amendment to as an improvement to the bill as discussed in Committee, are there any additional comments?",302,,
1053,0.97,8776.0,8786.878,I do have several questions I am going to try to lump them together and see if we can do this quickly.,303,,
1054,0.97,8786.878,8827.485,"So I have a question about Emma we have been working lately especially with a lot of coalitions, that are kind of a mix of organizations that are mostly Volunteer-Based and some organizations that do have staff, that have a paid staff to help with some of their work, so I am wondering what this means for coalitions, and I think this is related, but also trying to understand that there is a distinction between how nonprofit organizations will be affected by this as opposed to For-Profit organizations and things that they are trying to do.",303,,
1055,0.97,8827.485,8828.886,That will be question one.,303,,
1056,0.97,8828.886,8908.733,"On the last point around For- profit and nonprofit, the lobbying regulations as a whole do not distinguish whether you are For-Profit or nonprofit, it is about the status of the person who is doing the lobbying, so there are several triggers if you look at the underlying bill that sort of Walk-Through, the first threshold is are you a lobbyist, if you are not a lobbyist and you are not paid to engage in lobbying behavior, then nothing else matters, nothing is going to change for you, but if you meet the definition of lobbying, and then, being a lobbyist, you have to register as such, and if you engage in sponsoring campaigns for $750 a month or $1500 over a period of three months, then that means that you would have to disclose your lobbying ctivity along with your expenditures related to whatever public campaign you launch to influence legislation.",304,,
1057,0.97,8908.733,8927.551,"So there is not a distinction in terms of if you are For- profit, it is not about the issue or the content of your speech, it is about whether or not you meet the Definitional requirement of lobbyist and the expenditure requirement necessary to rise to the next level.",304,,
1058,0.97,8927.551,8980.604,"We did specifically because we were concerned about how coalitions work together, that is why we reached out to Julia from the Seattle human services coalition to ask her specifically if she had any concerns around the indirect lobbying portions of this bill, understanding that she has a very large Totalization coalition of organizations that come together to request particular outcomes, and so we did receive some responses from Seattle ethics and elections Commission that were related to how do we address some of those particular concerns and I am pulling it up now?",304,,
1059,0.97,8980.604,8985.509,Give me just a minute.,304,,
1060,0.97,8985.509,8985.71,Okay.,304,,
1061,0.97,8985.71,9028.953,"So some of the primary concerns related to how they use their mailing list, which was a primary form of how coalitions engaged with one another and how they activate people who are part of those mailing Ists, and so with the exemption with communications with members which is this amendment, then people who have the capacity to for example vote for an organization's director or pay dues, etc., would not be subjected to the indirect lobbying requirement, so without this amendment, it would trigger disclosure requirements for even coalition organizations.",304,,
1062,0.97,9028.953,9089.914,"I am happy to share this Email with you after the fact, there are probably about a dozen questions that were posed by Julia that we had Wayne answer that we can then share the answers with Julia about, but I think it also is important for us to remember that when we are talking about presenting a program, according to Seattle ethics and elections Commission what that means is using things like paid social media, paid billboards or other means of paid communication to encourage people to contact their elected officials and urge them to either support or oppose a piece of legislation, so again, if a coalition is meeting the expenditure requirements, is communicating outside of their membership list, and meets the definition of lobbyist, then they would be required to file a disclosure that would include expenditure disclosures.",304,,
1063,0.97,9089.914,9093.15,Thank you.,305,,
1064,0.97,9093.15,9125.649,"So that probably answers my next question then, which is, we do here often from some of our most marginalized communities, formerly incarcerated, sex workers, folks who are Undocumented, and so in order to make sure that they are protected, that was my concern, but it sounds like if they are not registered as a lobbyist and would not fall under that definition, then that is a moot point.",305,,
1065,0.97,9125.649,9141.699,"Right, yes, the first threshold is are you a lobbyist engaged in compensated lobbying work and then are you Expending the required minimal amounts in order to trigger the disclosures?",306,,
1066,0.97,9141.699,9215.039,"Even lobbyists who spend less than $1500 in a three-month period would not be required to do disclosures, so I think this is a new framework, a new form of disclosure compared to--and they are committed to making sure that they engage in public education and in Rulemaking to make sure that they are not creating a chilling effect for organizing work, but this is really about who is paying for public influence campaigns that are at sort of a higher payment level, so this legislation is not intended to, nor does it, I believe, prohibit ongoing efforts of people to continue to organize within community to do outreach to either support or oppose legislation that the city council is considering.",306,,
1067,0.97,9215.039,9218.075,Any other comments or questions on amendment two?,306,,
1068,0.97,9218.075,9228.686,"Hearing no additional comments on amendment two, will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of amendment two?",306,,

1075,0.97,9286.043,9362.686,"Just very briefly, I want to also thank--my understanding is that they went through a pretty robust community engagement process, we discussed it on Wednesday and just to reiterate for our ongoing concerns that individuals may have or organizations may have, there is going to be a six month process to fully have conversations with community, I started my line of petitioning when--I look forward to hearing more about how the upcoming six months goes, and I know that folks are not shy about continuing to let us know how legislation is going to continue to be implemented and if there are unintended consequence I think we have shown a willingness time and time again to make improvements and I am really optimistic with the amended language that was include today that some of those concerns have been met, thank you and your office for the work you did with immigrant rights groups and--I know you have reached out to a handful of folks to make sure that you are getting some feedback.",311,,
1076,0.97,9362.686,9371.295,"Thank you for that work, and it makes me optimistic about the six-month conversation to come and looking forward to report back.",311,,

1078,0.97,9375.899,9384.241,"Councilmember Sawant and then if anyone else wants to speak, let me know.",312,,
1079,0.97,9384.241,9420.244,"As I stated during the amendments, this bill including, with the restriction on grassroots lobbying is not something I can support, I am disappointed that Council President Gonzalez continues to falsely claim that only paid lobbying is affected--so it is not what the Council President is saying.",313,,
1080,0.97,9420.244,9438.662,"I also want to point out that the Council heard from grassroots campaigners and public comments saying that it will have a chilling effect on grassroots organizing, why would Councilmembers pass a law and claim that it will not kill grassroots organizers right after hearing from grassroots organizers that will have a chilling effect?",313,,
1081,0.97,9438.662,9447.404,So I will be voting no.,313,,

1083,0.97,9449.273,9507.13,"I just want to speak to my belief and my hope, and as Councilmember Mosqueda mentioned, we can Revisit this issue, but I really believe that the reporting requirements to register are not onerous, and they should not result in the kinds of outcomes to true grassroots lobbying that some people might have some concerns about, and I think that the concerns are far outweighed by the harm that this bill seeks to address . from my perspective, that harm is the allowance of dark money to be used without any disclosure.",315,,
1084,0.97,9507.13,9515.272,"Many of you remember that last year there was a paid lobbying campaign against the payroll tax legislation, it turns out that the Chamber had noted that they had funded it but they were not required to disclose this.",315,,
1085,0.97,9515.272,9538.395,"This I think is, this lack of disclosure is much more corrosive to our democratic values and our institutions than the burden that this disclosure requirement will place on what we traditionally think of as grassroots lobbying.",315,,
1086,0.97,9538.395,9554.878,"The term grassroots is used in Washington state law, and I do not think it is the Clearest term for describing this activity for public understanding, but in practice, it has the same effect of disclosure requirements in cities like Los Angeles.",315,,
1087,0.97,9554.878,9568.058,Where they define lobbying activities to include seeking to influence the --,315,,
1088,0.97,9576.333,9620.043,"I think it is very important that our regulations be content neutral, but in being content neutral, I do not think the outcome is going to be a neutral outcome, I think the outcome is going to be a much more robust disclosure of those in positions of power with access to great amounts of resources to our democratic decision-making, and that is really why I appreciate the proposal of the ethics and elections Commission bringing this forward and the work of Council President Gonzalez bringing this forward, thank you.",316,,

1091,0.97,9638.161,9732.389,"Okay, I am going to go ahead and close out debate, I want to thank you all for the consideration of this particular bill, I feel really strongly as indicated by Councilmember Herbold that the benefits of having this kind of lobbying regulation within the city of Seattle far outweighs the burden and the potential hardship of the disclosure and do trust that the Seattle ethics and elections Commission will work diligently to make sure that folks understand what the new framework and environment is and how to work with folks who are going to be potentially required to engage in this disclosure to successfully do so, I also do not want to lose sight of the fact that this bill does have two other really important components to it .--which is additional disclosure for lobbyists who work on--requiring those disclosures to happen, in addition to that, making sure that we are including disclosure requirements for--we know that a lot of policy is driven at the Department level, at the city of Seattle and I think that is an important transparency requirement as well.",317,,
1092,0.97,9732.389,9749.072,"So on balance, I think there are a lot of good things in this Council bill that will increase good Governance and transparency at the city level and I appreciate your consideration at this late hour of this bill as amended.",317,,

1151,0.97,10772.394,10785.741,"I think as we head into the January 8 action, it is absolutely crucial for hundreds of millions of workers who will be on strike alongside the farmers, along with the student movement, we have to also raised the slogan--which is long live the unity between farmers and workers.",325,,
1152,0.97,10785.741,10793.315,Thank you.,325,,
1153,0.97,10793.315,10823.779,"Thank you Councilmember Sawant, we are going to go ahead and consider amendment one now that we have heard general comments, but before we open it up for any additional comments on the underlying resolution, there was an amendment that was circulated previously today, consistent with counsel rules, so I am going to go ahead and recognize Councilmember Sawant for that motion of amendment one.",326,,
1154,0.97,10823.779,10849.371,"I move amendment one inserting the following sentences, section 3 the Seattle city Council and in solidarity with the farmers organizations during--organizing for a general strike on January 8, 2021, to unite the movements of oppressed peoples, demanding Restorations for--increasing the minimum wage, ending privatization, and defending the rights of religious and ethnic minorities.",327,,
1155,0.97,10849.371,10857.646,We heard from a number of ordinary people specifically from the Sikh community and also the broader Asian community.,327,,
1156,0.97,10857.646,10894.717,"And every single person of those spoke in favor of this amendment because the protest movement have already shown enormous strength as I mentioned before, having lasted nearly 3 weeks with an impressive degree of organization and political strength but it would be fatal if we got complacent, the movement has to escalate in order to--the Modi regime will keep trying various divide and conquer tricks to break the back of the movement for example labeling Sikh farmers as terrorists.",327,,
1157,0.97,10894.717,10945.267,"They will keep trying these tactics, if they do not succeed in that terrific horrific effort--they will simply try and wait out the movement, wait for protesters to get exhausted and demoralized, as members of the labor movement like myself know, we have seen this happen, and we know that when we are fighting the bosses we need to have tactics that would escalate the struggle and put increased pressure on the bosses to force them concede--the call for the general strike as I said is being supported by 100 farmer organizations, 10 trade union configurations that represent hundreds of millions of workers, union members, and student organizations.",327,,
1158,0.97,10945.267,10977.032,"The unions are demanding the restoration of protections for small farmers, increasing the minimum wage, establishing pensions and social security from it for workers and--to understand the potential impact of such an action and why I am urging Councilmembers to support this amendment, we should know that the trade movement has carried out three general strike movements recently.",327,,
1159,0.97,10977.032,10981.804,"One in January 2019, one in January this year, and a third one in late November.",327,,
1160,0.97,10981.804,10996.952,Each of those general strikes has been the single largest general strike in global labor history.,327,,
1161,0.97,11000.389,11028.751,"The last two strikes brought 215 million--these are absolutely massive, these are earth shattering actions, and I think this is the kind of earth shattering action we need in order to be able to combat the hundreds of billions and indeed trillions of dollars that are facing the poor workers and farmers at the hands of the billionaire class.",327,,
1162,0.97,11028.751,11031.253,"So I urge you to support this amendment, thank you.",327,,

1165,0.97,11046.001,11052.508,It has been moved and Seconded to amend the resolution on amendment one.,328,,
1166,0.97,11052.508,11081.136,"Councilmember Sawant, you have already made comments about amendment one, so I am going to go ahead and open it up to the floor to see if there are any additional comments on amendment one and as is usually the case, Councilmember Sawant, you will have the final word on amendment one, but we are going to open up the floor.",328,,
1167,0.97,11081.136,11086.642,"Councilmember Strauss, please.",328,,
1168,0.97,11086.642,11089.711,"Thank you for bringing this resolution forward, I will be supporting the base resolution.",329,,
1169,0.97,11089.711,11137.359,"Since public comment,--from Kent who brought this resolution to our city council for consideration called me to ask what other public Commenters were speaking about when discussing section 3, and she had not previously been aware of section 3. from my communications in my phone call with her, just in the last number of hours, it was her preference to maintain the focus of this resolution on sections 1 and 2, and for those reasons I will not be voting for this amendment, although I support this resolution and everything that was brought forward.",329,,
1170,0.97,11137.359,11139.862,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, any additional comments on that one?",330,,

1172,0.97,11154.409,11275.931,"Yes, I appreciate Councilmember Strauss, I completely disagree, for not supporting this amendment and the reasons he stated, I think they are quite stunning, but I appreciate that Councilmember Strauss was open on why he was voting no on the amendment, and I think that is--but unfortunately nobody else has spoken to it so I do not know what to make of it, I do appreciate Councilmember Herbold Seconding of my amendment so that we can at least have a discussion, but I think that it is extremely important to recognize that regardless of what Ethnicities elected officials may have, at the end of the day, the test that we as an ordinary people have to put them to is are they standing with the ordinary people of whatever issue is at hand, or are they standing with the establishment and I think it is very telling that at least according to what Councilmember Strauss has said, and I am assuming that other Council members share that position, I think that it is deeply unfortunate because it is not a question of one elected official even if they may be from a certain community, dozens of people from the same ethnic community testified in public comment saying that they wanted you to support that action, and they had their own words to describe why they think it is important because they understand that this action has the potential to greatly escalate the struggle which the farmers and the workers under this pandemic do, they understand the need for--and that is why there was a general strike in solidarity with the farmers because they understand that they not only strengthen the farmers movement they strengthen their own movement and that the struggle for--and I just want all of the ordinary people and community members to understand what is going on here.",331,,
1173,0.97,11275.931,11295.851,"At the end of the day, we have to observe that politicians are doing--or are they listening to community members who one after another came and said that they want the city Council to support this amendment?",331,,
1174,0.97,11295.851,11300.155,I will be voting yes on this amendment and I still urge other Councilmembers to vote yes.,331,,
1175,0.97,11300.155,11312.768,"Okay, I am going to close out debate on this particular amendment, so let's go ahead and have the clerk call the roll on the adoption of amendment one.",332,,

1177,0.97,11358.814,11363.218,Okay.,334,,
1178,0.97,11363.218,11374.896,"The motion fails for a lack of majority one way or the other, so the amendment is not adopted.",334,,
1179,0.97,11374.896,11398.92,"We are not going to move to consideration of the resolution, and I think we have had a lot of debate on it, are there any additional comments on the resolution as proposed?",334,,
1180,0.97,11399.087,11399.688,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",334,,
1181,0.97,11399.688,11439.261,"I want to be really clear that the folks I am hearing from including members not only that have been elected but members who are working directly with the Punjabi community and the community at large who have been asking for this I think that folks want to send a clear message about what is currently happening in India, a message to the congressional delegation and for me personally that does not mean not wanting to support a general strike I think that there is going to be another meeting and more opportunities for us to continue to show solidarity with a general strike but I want to make sure that I am following the lead of the Punjabi community who has been reaching out and asking for the specific language in he resolution today.",335,,
1182,0.97,11439.261,11523.144,"I will be making sure that we are pushing out information about the general strike, people do not come to a strike easily, this is often the last line of effort to try to make sure that messages are being heard, we know that time and time again that these farmers have tried to negotiate, they have protested, they have put their lives in Harms way both because of Covid-19 and also because of the ongoing repressive attracts from the police and the government being exposed to very cold temperatures and water Cannons, their life is on the line, so we know that they have done everything they can personally, I support the general strike, I will be putting out messages from our office in support to make sure that people know how to--but in following with what the Punjabi community has asked for today which is a very clear resolution specific to a national message across the globe, I am very excited about this resolution I think it is an unfortunate conversation about who we are following but I do not think that those two things have to stand in isolation, we can send forward this clear resolution today and also stand in support of the upcoming general strike which I plan to do and I plan to send out messages from our office.",335,,
1183,0.97,11523.144,11564.786,"I want to make sure that folks hear directly that this is absolutely something that I am interested in doing in support of those who have reached out initially very happy to have this resolution passed today and that said I am also going to be supporting the call for the general strike I know that is not a decision people come to lightly often the last line of defense when thinking about the strategies in front of us and it takes a huge act of courage to do so, so first of all I want to let folks know that--wanted to stand in solidarity and--to our office and more information forthcoming obviously on that first week of action in January.",335,,

1186,0.97,11569.391,11612.334,"Thank you, I fully agree as a member of the labor movement myself that it is not easy for workers to go on strike, it is a very difficult decision and it requires a tremendous amount of sacrifice, there are lots of twists and turns because the bosses in this case are the Modi regime and the billionaire class, they will try to wait out the movement as much as they can, so during the strike action it requires a lot of resilience and a lot of strategic and tactical political clarity for the workers and solidarity for them to not be broken.",337,,
1187,0.97,11612.334,11717.472,"But I am not sure what is being achieved by this counsel not supporting the amendment for the strike action, because they have already declared the strike action so when we agree that it is not easy for them to do this, that means that it has been an extremely hard and long road for them, so I am not sure how it helps to fight for the general strike by sending a message of, this is not what the Punjabi community wants, I also do not agree with the idea that not having the clause for the general strike support is somehow following the lead of the Punjabi community,--we heard from dozens of Punjabi and Sikh working people and dozens more and hundreds more have spoken in different ways, not just today, that they are supporting the strike action . I absolutely agree that we all should be supporting the general relief action,--I wanted to call on everybody, all the ordinary people, members of the public who are watching this, let's make sure that we organize a massive, historic, January 8, 2021--in Seattle, I am not saying the location yet because we are and let everybody know, but my point is, let's make it a massive and successful action, and let's stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the masses in India who are struggling for a better world.",337,,
