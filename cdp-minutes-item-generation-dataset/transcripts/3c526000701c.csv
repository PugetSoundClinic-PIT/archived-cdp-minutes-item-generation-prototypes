73,0.97,336.736,349.816,"Hello, my name is MIA Kelly I'm in Organizer with--I am here in support of the ordinance on the introduction calendar today.",31,,
74,0.97,349.816,357.924,The pay up campaign was created from the necessity of what gig workers want and need.,31,,
75,0.97,357.924,361.16,"A good pay, flexible work schedule, the ability to work with a Harassment.",31,,
76,0.97,361.16,364.63,"Workers found this type of work to be enjoyable, satisfying and suited their needs.",31,,
77,0.97,364.63,376.209,Workers that have taken pride in their work . I know personally because I am a former Instacart shopper.,31,,
78,0.97,376.209,382.115,"I personally witnessed and felt the effects of the company changing their contract over and over again, lowering the pay and making the job worse time and time again.",31,,
79,0.97,382.115,384.751,Putting us all in a financial tailspin.,31,,
80,0.97,384.751,405.438,"Today over 40,000 workers in our city are only offered sub minimum wage, excluded from basic worker protections, responsible for an Ever- expanding expense and on a downward spiral to the next poverty level.",31,,
81,0.97,405.438,406.272,Working hand to mouth.,31,,
82,0.97,406.272,411.144,We gig workers have been working on creating standards and laws for a long time.,31,,
83,0.97,411.144,430.229,"After years of organizing, a year of Stakeholder meetings and policy development, it's time for Seattle city leaders to deliver for gig workers by advancing our policies to raise pay, a flexible schedule, and provide meaningful transparency for those working in the industry.",31,,
84,0.97,430.229,446.879,"The gig economy has grown by leaps and bounds and even though they haven't had the same looks as other service jobs do, we can see the Far- reaching effects that gig workers had on jobs he may have traditionally been part of a company now can be Outsourced with a smart phone or computer.",31,,
85,0.97,446.879,451.484,We must take action now so the standards are in place to protect workers and not Demolish hard-fought labor protection.,31,,
86,0.97,451.484,459.559,This is a common sense policy that ensures workers are paid at least minimum wage after expenses with the flexibility entrance.,31,,
87,0.97,459.559,459.926,That we need.,31,,
88,0.97,459.926,464.764,Thank you for moving forward today.,31,,
89,0.97,464.764,470.002,The next Speaker on the list is Herman.,32,,

91,0.97,476.742,477.91,All,32,,
92,0.97,477.91,482.849,"Hello, can you hear me okay?",33,,
93,0.97,482.982,484.884,Yes we can.,34,,
94,0.97,484.884,485.284,Okay.,35,,
95,0.97,485.284,489.589,"Hello, my name is Herman.",35,,
96,0.97,489.589,497.396,I am a gig worker on grub Hub and I'm here to support the policy.,35,,
97,0.97,497.396,504.971,[Indiscernible] if I break every traffic law and get creative with parking and easy order might take me 15 minutes.,35,,
98,0.97,504.971,507.44,Doing simple math that is $20 per hour on the high end.,35,,
99,0.97,507.44,525.291,"From that $20 I need to taxes, gas, car insurance and constant maintenance and repairs like the cost of flat tires or a new battery.",35,,
100,0.97,525.291,530.663,That $20 per hour quickly falls below minimum wage after driver expenses articulated.,35,,
101,0.97,530.663,538.804,"Flexibility and being your own boss, in reality they are the boss controlling us with penalties and threats of Deactivation.",35,,
102,0.97,538.804,545.611,"Flexibility is not simply, I have some free time, let me log on and earn little pocket cash.",35,,
103,0.97,545.611,556.589,"For me, and thousands of a gig workers like me, flexibility means the ability to work at the pace and intensity I need on a schedule I can manage.",35,,
104,0.97,556.589,560.226,Gig work is my only source of income.,35,,
105,0.97,560.226,563.029,And the only industry that allows me the flexibility I need.,35,,
106,0.97,563.029,575.908,"However, flexibility is being eroded as Amps wrap up control to maximize their own profits.",35,,
107,0.97,575.908,579.946,The pay up policy would protect the flexibility I need will guaranteeing I would be paid fully from a labor.,35,,
108,0.97,579.946,582.782,Thank you for your support.,35,,
109,0.97,582.782,591.724,"The next Speaker on the list is Terry, following after that is Michelle who is showing up is not present.",36,,
110,0.97,591.724,592.291,Terry.,36,,
111,0.97,592.291,606.739,"High, I am Teresa and I am here asking for support for the pay up campaign.",37,,
112,0.97,606.739,609.809,I have been working with the gig economy since 2019 with the handy App directly.,37,,
113,0.97,609.809,616.515,"In the last three years I have seen inexperienced for handy alone, false promise of flexibility, I've also seen the false promise of scheduling.",37,,
114,0.97,616.515,625.024,I have seen latent denial of responsibility by the handy App in terms of customer service.,37,,
115,0.97,625.024,629.662,Both towards contracting professionals and the client.,37,,
116,0.97,629.662,643.075,Handy continues to this day to behave as a cleaning agency that hires employees rather than the technology company that they are actually billing themselves as.,37,,
117,0.97,643.075,648.581,We know that the App contractor relationship has been broken for years.,37,,
118,0.97,648.581,656.322,And we know there has been no demonstrated stewardship by App companies to fix it.,37,,
119,0.97,656.322,660.593,We know that contract changes have always been made by the App.,37,,
120,0.97,660.593,669.735,We know these changes I've always favored the App and we know the contract changes have never favored contractors.,37,,
121,0.97,669.735,674.974,"Regardless of the App, none of these contract changes have ever favored contractors.",37,,
122,0.97,674.974,677.843,Have always favored the App.,37,,
123,0.97,677.843,709.942,"And this is why today I am saying, you know, blatantly, we need your support at Seattle city council in passing the pay up policy . We need you to set the example of local legislation that has developed and strengthened stewardship and partnership between contractors and the App companies themselves.",37,,
124,0.97,709.942,715.381,"Because without quality partnership, we will never become a better economy.",37,,
125,0.97,715.381,718.884,Thank you.,37,,
126,0.97,718.884,726.592,Our next Speaker is John followed by Shelby.,38,,
127,0.97,726.592,727.96,"John, you are next.",38,,
128,0.97,727.96,743.275,My name is John W. I have been gig worker for 2.5 years.,39,,
129,0.97,743.943,746.745,I am here to talk about why gig workers need the pay a policy.,39,,
130,0.97,746.745,749.949,As a Rover worker I'm grateful for the level of control I have over my schedule.,39,,
131,0.97,749.949,751.417,Though I think it could be better.,39,,
132,0.97,751.417,760.993,Rover believes it's a marketplace like Craigslist were the confined Walkers and sitters but the reality is Rover exercises too much power over its workers to be considered a marketplace.,39,,
133,0.97,760.993,768.834,They try to control my schedule by lowering my rating when I am not taking jobs.,39,,
134,0.97,768.834,772.304,The preferences the App allows me to set are very primitive.,39,,
135,0.97,772.304,783.115,I believe updating the App to allow for more--would be fixing issues but ultimately it will never be capable of factoring in all the nuances of whether a job is worth it to me.,39,,
136,0.97,783.115,787.753,So I believe the search ratings system needs to be replaced with an Unbiased system.,39,,
137,0.97,787.753,802.568,"The system could show sitters the clients randomly and allow the client to filter based on preferences important to them like proximity, price, average rating, et cetera.",39,,
138,0.97,802.568,808.207,Being selective about which jobs I take allows me to make a decent amount of money per hour while still keeping things relatively affordable for the customer.,39,,
139,0.97,808.207,819.618,"This directly impacts the amount of work I can do in a given time period and the time I have outside of work to relax and spend time with my family, take classes, et cetera.",39,,
140,0.97,819.618,830.196,Also in regards to pay I believe minimum wage needs to be established for Rover and other gig worker Apps to avoid being driven down over time.,39,,
141,0.97,830.196,833.832,It needs to factor in the extra time and costs associated with being a contractor on each App.,39,,
142,0.97,833.832,838.337,It is important that workers are not only able to survive but also take steps to improve their standard of living over time.,39,,
143,0.97,838.337,842.174,Thank you for supporting gig workers.,39,,
144,0.97,842.174,851.517,Next Speaker is Shelby Hansen.,40,,
145,0.97,851.517,852.952,"High, can you hear me?",41,,
146,0.97,852.952,853.886,Yes.,42,,
147,0.97,853.886,858.824,I am Shelby and I am a gig worker on Rover.,43,,
148,0.97,858.824,862.494,I am a member of the pay up campaign.,43,,
149,0.97,862.494,871.237,I work for the Rover App which is a pet sitting and dog Walker service.,43,,
150,0.97,871.237,882.815,I thought it would be fun to work with pets and while I was pet sitting I had some owners who are not honest with me and left me with medical bills getting hurt by their dog.,43,,
151,0.97,882.815,885.484,The reason why I worked for Rover is because of the flexible schedule.,43,,
152,0.97,885.484,890.522,I have medical appointments to help me manage my disabilities.,43,,
153,0.97,890.522,895.995,And these take precedence over a regular 9-5 work schedule.,43,,
154,0.97,895.995,901.9,Without the flexibility I honestly couldn't work.,43,,
155,0.97,901.9,904.336,With the pay and without the health coverage it's not worth the danger.,43,,
156,0.97,904.336,916.715,"Rover also would encourage gig workers, a lope threshold in order to undercut other Rover workers.",43,,
157,0.97,916.715,918.55,This base pay is not enough to sustain livable wage.,43,,
158,0.97,918.55,930.929,"When you have to choose between food to stay alive or transportation or even rent, this is no way to live.",43,,
159,0.97,930.929,937.036,Changing your price point to something lower only hurts us.,43,,
160,0.97,937.036,940.673,It hurts all of us in the long run.,43,,
161,0.97,940.673,955.521,We need the Seattle city Council to pass the pay up policy for gig workers and set the pay standard for gig workers in 2022 because I need to be able to pay my bills and for basic survival.,43,,
162,0.97,955.521,957.556,We need your help.,43,,
163,0.97,957.556,960.192,Thank you for your time.,43,,
164,0.97,960.192,962.027,It is much appreciated.,43,,
165,0.97,962.027,969.935,I also just want to say--thank you for your time.,43,,
166,0.97,969.935,975.007,Our next Speaker is David Haynes followed by Jackie Morris.,44,,
167,0.97,975.007,975.975,David Haynes?,44,,

169,0.97,979.845,981.313,Thank you.,46,,
170,0.97,981.313,982.548,"David Haynes, District 7.",46,,
171,0.97,982.548,1003.669,Council bill 120292 looks like another privileged abuse of tax dollars rewarding human services Department who redirected all of that still needed money for homeless crisis shelters to other bad policy decisions that further undermine public safety.,46,,
172,0.97,1003.669,1013.011,Always seem to use tax money buying off unions and service providers as a reelection apparatus within government and Nongovernment unions.,46,,
173,0.97,1013.011,1030.863,Never held accountable for a racist lens the judges skin color and Prioritizes Bipoc criminal repeat offenders to manipulate data and squander homeless crisis money while forsaking innocent homeless citizens denied another winter year of help.,46,,
174,0.97,1030.863,1049.915,"Is corrupt human services Department gets another way and guarantee of failures to solve the homeless crisis exacerbated by bad policies and leadership, treasonous Lee and Unconstitutionally running interference for low-level drug pushers destroying lives daily.",46,,
175,0.97,1049.915,1050.382,Victimizing others.,46,,
176,0.97,1050.382,1056.021,Yet treated like nonviolent's demeanor victim of inequity.,46,,
177,0.97,1056.021,1094.86,"Assisted by a care model that has less than 50% success rate mostly because of Self- destructive customs violating repeat offending criminals undermining their fellow man are the only ones helped while innocent liberal race war on innocent homeless citizens blame for most crime just based on skin color and only help if more profitable Wraparound services--lying about the data, the public safety and the dishonest service provider hours of service never held honest by oversight from Council.",46,,
178,0.97,1094.86,1107.239,Whose other bad policy of accepting --,46,,
179,0.97,1107.239,1114.58,Err last Speaker present is Jackie Morris.,47,,
