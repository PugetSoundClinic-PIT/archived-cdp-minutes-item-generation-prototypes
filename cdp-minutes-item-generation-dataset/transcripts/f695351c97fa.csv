146,0.97,1461.66,1477.876,He founded new black arts West and headed up over 40 productions and acted in over 30. I will say more about this in the city council vote this afternoon.,11,,
147,0.97,1477.876,1487.953,"For the cultural district, they nominated Mr. Barnett for the honorary Street name and coordinated logistics and funding with the Seattle Department of transportation.",11,,
148,0.97,1487.953,1488.553,We appreciate their efforts.,11,,
149,0.97,1488.553,1511.743,"As the briefing is on, the community Organizer from my office is in the central district, District 3, with community members and with the U.S. postal service and members of the Seattle local of the American postal Euchre's Union celebrating the opening of the post office.",11,,
150,0.97,1511.743,1530.962,"It's a win for the community and for public services powered by hundreds of activists working with our Socialist office to demand that the Federal Government restore our neighborhood post office, especially given the current attacks on the post office by the Trump administration.",11,,
151,0.97,1530.962,1545.744,"Thanks to the U.S. postal service, members of the greater Seattle postal workers Union and members of the senior center and hundreds of other neighbors who wrote letters and sign petitions demanding the restoration of the post office.",11,,
152,0.97,1545.744,1548.346,We know this issue goes beyond our neighborhood.,11,,
153,0.97,1548.346,1552.117,The post office is under unprecedented and vicious attacks by the Trump administration.,11,,
154,0.97,1552.117,1571.503,"They would like nothing more than to tear down this vital public service and put mail delivery and the hands of big business Profiteers . We are in solidarity with the American postal workers Union, fighting back against this and postal workers all over the country oppose this attack.",11,,
155,0.97,1571.503,1582.38,"In a very small way, but important for us, the reopening of the post office at 2207 East Union is a blow against attacks on social services.",11,,
156,0.97,1582.38,1589.587,The community that is the post office is the same community struggling to hold on to affordable housing.,11,,
157,0.97,1589.587,1595.894,Far too many working-class homeowners and Renters and disproportionately black and other members of color are being driven out of our city.,11,,
158,0.97,1595.894,1614.079,"That is wrong and when we see public institutions disappearing, that is wrong . I congratulate everybody who wrote letters, signed our petition and came to our community meeting to advocate for this post office that builds on our historic Amazon tax victory earlier this summer.",11,,
159,0.97,1614.079,1629.461,It permits $80 million a year and affordable housing in the city beginning in 2022 to help bring back black working-class households.,11,,
160,0.97,1629.461,1641.64,"According to Trump in the right wing, Seattle is apparently not just a Socialist Hellhole but an anarchist jurisdiction.",11,,
161,0.97,1641.64,1648.146,Donald Trump's Justice Department has labeled Portland and Seattle and New York City as anarchist jurisdictions.,11,,
162,0.97,1648.146,1654.653,"As part of the rationale for labeling them as anarchist jurisdictions, they cited city council's voting to cut police funding.",11,,
163,0.97,1654.653,1667.065,I'm really gratified to see many political figures in the areas criticizing this move from the Trump regime.,11,,
164,0.97,1667.065,1682.113,"I would add that the real opposition that needs to be shown in our city, in Seattle, by Democrats, has to be led by following through on promises to Defund the police by at least 50%.",11,,
165,0.97,1682.113,1694.592,The first step will be to overturn the Democrat Mayor Durkan's veto of the summer budget vote by the Council and to uphold the mild but important progressive gains remaining to that budget.,11,,
166,0.97,1694.592,1712.243,"Last but not least, the office of professional accountability has concluded and the newly released reports that the police officer who doused a 7-Year-Old boy with pepper spray at the May 30 justice protests was, quote, lawful and proper . This is absolutely shameful and unacceptable.",11,,
167,0.97,1712.243,1727.292,"According to the report, the officer directed the pepper sprayed a woman who Quote- Unquote grabbed onto an officer's baton and yelled, don't push me.",11,,
168,0.97,1727.292,1731.896,Police tried to move a line of protesters at Westlake Plaza.,11,,
169,0.97,1731.896,1737.769,"Apparently, that was justification to use pepper spray on anyone, let alone a child.",11,,
170,0.97,1737.769,1746.144,This is yet another example that illustrates why working people need to fight for the oversight board that has powers over the police.,11,,
171,0.97,1746.144,1751.049,It's an example of how the Democratic establishment in various cities need to set a better example.,11,,
172,0.97,1751.049,1758.957,That's the best way to fight against Trump and the right wing.,11,,

199,0.97,1966.898,1977.976,"For the items on the full council agenda from the public safety Committee, we have one item, relating to the Puget sound emergency radio network.",16,,
200,0.97,1977.976,2022.453,"This is a Digital radio communication system used for emergency response and replaces a 20-year-old analog system no longer supported by the vendor and this legislation allows us to enter into an Interlocal agreement between 12 jurisdictions and will then create a new nonprofit to own, operate and maintain the radio network . The nonprofit will have an agreement before us and it will be an into her local agreement for the operations of that nonprofit among the 12 jurisdictions.",16,,
201,0.97,2022.453,2038.069,"Other items related to public safety and human services, I want to uplift, as I do every week, the efforts of the Seattle fire Department and their administration of Covid- 19 tests at their four sites.",16,,
202,0.97,2038.069,2041.239,"Now, dating back to June 5.",16,,
203,0.97,2041.239,2053.184,"They have administered more than 190,000 tests, Covid-19 tests.",16,,
204,0.97,2053.184,2063.461,Wanting to recognize that important work our fire Department is participating in and leading in.,16,,
205,0.97,2063.461,2119.75,"I want to uplift that the fire Department, as mentioned last week, has issued a number of out of city Deployments known as mutual aid and a total of 34 fire Department firefighters redeployed to the Oregon and Washington fires and 31 two Oregon and fires in Washington state . for the police Department, I just want to mention that last week, there was a follow-up to what we recently heard in press accounts about the shortcomings and addressing overtime controls in the 2016 city auditor recommendations.",16,,
206,0.97,2119.75,2131.996,Follow-up letter was sent to chief Diaz about implementation of those recommendations . 30 recommendations were in the report regarding budgeting and policy procedures including tracking of overtime and off duty work.,16,,
207,0.97,2131.996,2153.15,"Many recommendations--most of them have been implemented but the recommendations listed as pending, many of arm relate to work with the Seattle information technology Department to implement a new work and Timekeeping system.",16,,
208,0.97,2153.15,2205.57,"I thanked the chief for the attention he is directing and dedicating to the issue of overtime but it's important that the Council gives an update about the implementation of the recommendations of the city auditor and since the audit recommended that SPD should implement new scheduling and Timekeeping systems while also enhancing existing systems to include Non-Automated controls, to facilitate the tracking, I've asked the city auditor to actually do a review of the Nonautomated controls that SPD has been working on while sold Matina say working to implement the technology solution.",16,,
209,0.97,2205.57,2231.862,"The upshot is just because the technology solution has a Timeline that has lagged, it certainly doesn't mean that we should not and cannot be doing more to ensure that policies are being adhered to as over time and off time work.",16,,
210,0.97,2231.862,2236.767,I look forward to hearing more from chief Diaz about that.,16,,
211,0.97,2236.767,2267.765,"Another question I would ask, the chief has said that the redeployment away from specialty units into 911 is another element that will help him keep track of overtime abuses or excessive use of overtime, even if it's not an actual violation.",16,,
212,0.97,2267.765,2303.067,"I'm interested and others will be interested, as well, to get some estimates of what number of overtime hours are likely to be reduced just from this deployment decision the chief has made to move 100 officers out of specialty units into 911 looking forward to getting that information, as well and also, I want to mention another request to chief Diaz.",16,,
213,0.97,2303.067,2337.968,"There was an article last week in the Seattle times regarding the arrest of an SPD captain for allegedly agreeing to pay for sex to a police Decoy posing as a prostitute and the preferential treatment he received by other officers . in that article, there is reference to the fact that this individual is being paid while on leave and that was a decision that was made many months ago.",16,,
214,0.97,2337.968,2358.689,The s PMA contract grants the chief the discretion to determine if leave without pay is necessary in order to maintain the public trust . I've asked the chief whether or not he is willing to reconsider the prying decision to grant pay pending the outcome of the criminal charges.,16,,
215,0.97,2358.689,2368.365,"The criminal charges, the consideration of the criminal charges, has been greatly delayed and this individual is still being paid while on leave.",16,,
216,0.97,2368.365,2376.774,It is this individual that has been paid quite a lot of money over the interim.,16,,
217,0.97,2376.774,2395.726,I think it is really appropriate as a question for consideration of the chief for whether or not leave without pay is a more appropriate response to this particular decision.,16,,
218,0.97,2395.726,2425.523,"Again, the OPA did have a finding of a sustained finding in this instance and the chief did have this decision to have the individual on leave but the question is whether or not the person should be paid during that leave.",16,,
219,0.97,2425.523,2453.184,"Before I moved to human services, I want to highlight information that we've received via a piece from the Washington post . It was picked up in the Seattle times related to a violent means and messages searching on social media with a reference to a new report.",16,,
220,0.97,2453.184,2482.847,"The report by the network research Institute previously had focused on right-wing violence from groups like the builder boys and warns that Left-Wing groups have embraced similar tactics, including Memes and catch phrases to spread messages and help coordinate off-line activity.",16,,
221,0.97,2482.847,2490.754,"The researchers pointed to possible signs of coordination associated with riots in Seattle, Portland and other cities on July 25 involving fires, looting and property damage.",16,,
222,0.97,2490.754,2510.507,"The report acknowledges that Left-Wing political actors, including those who embrace the so-called Antifa movement, have been responsible for far less violence than white Supremacists and other White ring groups.",16,,
223,0.97,2510.507,2514.011,It's a finding consistent with conclusions of law enforcement and other threat analysts.,16,,
224,0.97,2514.011,2528.459,They recognize that Left-Wing extremism is not immune from the efforts to coordinate violent responses.,16,,
225,0.97,2528.459,2551.649,The researchers found that the growing use of means is a warning sign and argued that the spread--and this is important--Dehumanizing rhetoric on the left and the right can set a stage for continued serious incidents by what the report referred to as network enabled mobs.,16,,
226,0.97,2551.649,2563.961,I want to reference that I do believe this is a troubling trend.,16,,
227,0.97,2563.961,2589.82,"I've stated my concern around bias crimes and hate crimes when we saw the rise from the right and likewise, the increase of evidence of these trends is troubling on the left . I reiterate my previous report for previous peaceful protesting in regards to property damage and violence.",16,,
228,0.97,2589.82,2608.706,"It's a plug that the human services Department asked me to use time in the briefings meeting to get out the word that Seattle public schools has been providing meal service to students through the summer but they are doing it during the school year, as well.",16,,

238,0.97,2708.706,2718.315,"And, to make sure the Whistleblower protections are extended in that instance.",16,,

255,0.97,2864.628,2871.835,Thank you.,18,,
256,0.97,2871.835,2879.009,I wanted to briefly respond to the point Councilmember Herbold made about the left and the right and it know she was quoting conclusions from a study.,18,,
257,0.97,2879.009,2879.743,I appreciate that.,18,,
258,0.97,2879.743,2893.824,"But, I'm gravely concerned at people in any way using the word extremism to refer to the left.",18,,
259,0.97,2893.824,2898.729,It is exactly what Donald Trump is doing.,18,,
260,0.97,2898.729,2909.039,Donald Trump is trying to whip up fears about the Left-Wing that are based almost entirely on lies.,18,,
261,0.97,2909.039,2921.918,"Of course, much of this fear is whipped up in my alluding to Antifa, which is in reference to activists that are Anti- Fascist.",18,,
262,0.97,2921.918,2941.872,"They actually are not Fascist, they are against fascism . I think we have--I certainly take this seriously--but I urge Democratic party politicians to take that very seriously.",18,,
263,0.97,2941.872,2952.916,It doesn't matter that the study used that word but political representatives have a serious responsibility to not use the phrase extremism because is no evidence to show that the Left-Wing is engaging in extremism.,18,,
264,0.97,2952.916,2971.802,"Throughout history, extremism and violence and things associated with the left through mainstream media is actually perpetrated by the right wing and by the state.",18,,
265,0.97,2971.802,2988.952,"So, I think it is extremely important to avoid language that is used to equate the violence of the Far-Right who murder people--the violence used by the state--by the police Department--to repress the protest movement and the So- called extremism on the left.",18,,
266,0.97,2988.952,2996.193,I know Councilmember Herbold was trying to be very precise and I appreciate that.,18,,
267,0.97,2996.193,3005.969,She was specifically talking about Memes but they do not equate actual violence and the weaponry used by the state against peaceful protests movements.,18,,
268,0.97,3005.969,3007.471,"Overwhelmingly, in the George Floyd movement, they have been peaceful.",18,,
269,0.97,3007.471,3009.806,We have to take that into account.,18,,
270,0.97,3009.806,3011.274,Thank you.,18,,
271,0.97,3011.274,3020.684,Think you're so much for those comments.,19,,
272,0.97,3020.684,3023.32,And the other comments or questions on Councilmember Herbold's report?,19,,
273,0.97,3023.32,3049.479,"Hearing none, we will go ahead and as Councilmember Herbold indicated, move through the steps related to the acquiring of Digital signatures for each of the Council members related to the Diaper need proclamation and for this Diaper need awareness week, it will be presented at this afternoon's city council meeting.",19,,

304,0.97,3132.729,3167.898,"The public Committee, we have two items on this afternoon's city council agenda starting with Council bill 119881 relating to renovating Keyarena . It authorizes the Mayor to execute the agreement with Seattle arena company, or as we know it, arena Co for pedestrian and bike improvement.",42,,
305,0.97,3167.898,3175.305,"For those that have been around since January 2017, it's a continuation of legislation, three years in the making, addressing the needs for the city of Seattle.",42,,

312,0.97,3269.799,3295.725,"A big shout out for Brian goodnight goodnight, who provided a memo for the background and information on the city's relationship with arena Co and summarizes commitments contained in the Moa.",42,,

341,0.97,3499.028,3504.334,"Hearing none, I will go ahead and conclude this morning's portion of this agenda with my report.",43,,
342,0.97,3504.334,3519.482,"Really quickly, wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that this last week we had a momentous occasion in our own community.",43,,
343,0.97,3519.482,3525.822,"I would like to congratulate the Tabernacle missionary Baptist church, celebrating their 70th anniversary this past week.",43,,

345,0.97,3536.366,3561.457,They are an inspiration to us all and we continue holding on to our proverbial yell 20 and I congratulate the Reverend and the congregation at Tabernacle missionary Baptist church on theirs 70 years of existing and serving our community in the central district.,43,,
346,0.97,3561.457,3581.21,"I had an opportunity, as Council President, to send a letter on behalf of the Council acknowledging their 70th year anniversary and wanted to take a moment in the Council briefing to acknowledge, publicly, that they just celebrated that momentous occasion.",43,,
347,0.97,3581.21,3594.524,"Really quickly, nothing on the agenda from the Governance and education committee meeting and in particular, I do have one item I intend to walk on to the introduction and referral calendar this afternoon at 2:00 P.M.",43,,
348,0.97,3594.524,3617.847,"Yesterday afternoon, central staff and budget manager Úcirculated to you a proposed bill that was developed over the past several weeks following countless hours of conversation between the Mayor's office, staff and my office, in particular.",43,,
349,0.97,3617.847,3626.322,I will suspend the rules to make a motion to places read legislation on the introduction and referral calendar.,43,,
350,0.97,3626.322,3632.161,The have been updates to that legislation since it was circulated yesterday afternoon.,43,,
351,0.97,3632.161,3640.87,My understanding is it will be circulated again this morning with additional changes made to that legislation.,43,,
352,0.97,3640.87,3654.917,This legislation serves as a vehicle for a possible compromise measure which the Council could consider and take up in the event that the Mayor's veto of the Council recent budget legislation is sustained by a vote of the Council.,43,,
353,0.97,3654.917,3671.1,"Due to some provisions in the primary judge at bill, 119825, for all Intents and purposes, a three quarters vote of the Council is necessary to effectively override the veto and allow for implementation of the intent in these bills.",43,,
354,0.97,3671.1,3692.522,"If the veto override vote fails to receive at least seven votes, it may be necessary to take action on the new legislation that I am proposing to be placed on the introduction and referral calendar for consideration at the special full council meeting tomorrow at 3:00 P.M.",43,,
355,0.97,3692.522,3706.202,"I intend to have this placed on the agenda for possible action tomorrow during this national meeting immediately following this consideration of the vetoed bills, consistent with our city charter.",43,,
356,0.97,3706.202,3728.925,"Again, because we have to have our conversation around Vetoes in open session, I want to make sure that depending on what happens with the overriding vote, that we have an alternative option present to the Council and generated by the Council in the event that the override is unsuccessful.",43,,
357,0.97,3728.925,3749.078,It is a priority for me to get some agreed-upon investments into community and to strike a balance in terms of some of the components that we've been able to find some common ground with the Mayor's office.,43,,
358,0.97,3749.078,3770.666,Allie Petrucci is a primary director of the legislation and she and Greg Dawes are available between now and tomorrow afternoon to address additional substantive questions you might have and I would acknowledge that the Council conversations with the Mayor's office are ongoing and it's possible we may see additional changes or updates to the legislation before we take final action at 3:00.,43,,
359,0.97,3770.666,3796.225,"I have them on the zoom call and wanted to provide a quick opportunity for Allie or Dan, to quickly give an overview of what is included in the proposed legislation I intend to walk on this afternoon for placement on the referral calendar.",43,,
360,0.97,3796.225,3814.11,"Colleagues, the intent is that if the override of the Mayor's Vetoes fail, then we would have an alternative bill to consider.",43,,
361,0.97,3814.11,3826.055,"So, Alli will describe what is in that alternative version of the bill that could be considered by the Council if, again, a veto override fails.",43,,
362,0.97,3826.055,3833.329,"Good morning, Council members.",44,,
363,0.97,3833.329,3847.376,Yesterday afternoon we distributed an Email with the draft of the bill and a table that offers a Side-By-Side comparison showing the changes that the Council made to the original budget revision ordinance and what is or is not in the replacement bill.,44,,
364,0.97,3847.376,3886.682,"It incorporates both amendments made to the Council of 119825 and adopted by the Council, as well as conceptually, pieces of the proposals that were in the other two vetoed bills, council below 119862 that authorized $3 million of spending from the revenue stabilization account to the alleged Department and Council bill 119863 that authorize the Interfund loan that supported the appropriations and the adopted 119825 for investments and community.",44,,
365,0.97,3886.682,3910.239,"The investment bill includes an appropriation to the Department for Participatory budgeting in 2020, $1 million and includes a $2.5 million appropriation to Hst for community led investments in the community safety space and the Interfund loan would no longer be required to support those appropriations.",44,,
366,0.97,3910.239,3918.147,"It captures much of what was included in the bill, in 119825 and the others as adopted with modifications.",44,,
367,0.97,3918.147,3932.194,"I won't walk through each one but at a high level, many of the changes are included in most of the Provisos related to the Seattle police Department are removed.",44,,
368,0.97,3932.194,3964.527,"The request for reports related to SPD operations and financial information has been modified to better align with information that we can get our hands on and will support Councilmember interest with information into the 2021 budget process . like I said, includes appropriations to support some community led investments and Participatory budgeting.",44,,
369,0.97,3964.527,3974.17,"I'm happy to answer questions off-line if you have an interest in any specific amendment and for myself or Dan, also on the line, if you want to talk about Vetoes and votes.",44,,
370,0.97,3974.17,3977.373,We are happy to talk Offline.,44,,
371,0.97,3977.373,3987.817,"Dan, anything that you would like to add to the remarks?",45,,
372,0.97,3987.817,3988.05,No.,46,,
373,0.97,3988.05,3989.085,I'm available for any questions people may have.,46,,
374,0.97,3989.085,4007.436,"Thank you for that quick, Overarching view of what is in this proposed alternative, should the override of the Mayor's veto fail.",47,,
375,0.97,4007.436,4027.556,"It's really important for us to have something in place that would be agreeable to the Mayor and her administration, in terms of immediate implementation and Operability for 2020.",47,,
376,0.97,4027.556,4043.739,I want to really quickly say that this bill is an attempt to try to move us forward.,47,,
377,0.97,4043.739,4059.221,"It moves forward Council priorities that continued to be priorities, including created a framework and a path toward the question around the size of the sworn personnel at the Seattle police Department.",47,,
378,0.97,4059.221,4070.866,"For example, a Pathway toward actively looking out of order with issues where we had an impasse publicly and privately with the Mayor.",47,,
379,0.97,4070.866,4107.636,"We now have an opportunity to put into writing and to Memorialize a path forward that will allow us to meaningfully engage with the executive around our interest as a Council and I believe it's also for community partners to really take a look at the size of the sworn personnel of the Seattle police . to do that, we have to pursue layoffs in order to not rollback many of the achievements we've made around diversity hires and Recruitments.",47,,
380,0.97,4107.636,4116.412,"Also, to focus on officers that we believe, from a policy perspective, should be considered first.",47,,
381,0.97,4116.412,4122.451,It's mainly those with disciplinary issues or with other problematic track records.,47,,
382,0.97,4122.451,4132.995,"Again, we would want the chief to consider for layoffs first before any officers that don't have similar issues.",47,,
383,0.97,4132.995,4181.911,"It has become abundantly clear that much of the disagreements within City Hall have created opportunities for our community to be pitted against each other and I think it's an opportunity for us, again, if the override fails tomorrow afternoon, to provide us an opportunity to find a path forward with the executive that will result in a series of shared policy goals, community investments and a new commitment to collaborating on solving, together, as a functional government, some of the most pressing issues facing members of our community.",47,,
384,0.97,4181.911,4195.758,It does continue to be our responsibility to make difficult choices and this is an opportunity for us to see if there is an opportunity to Memorialize some compromise.,47,,
385,0.97,4195.758,4237.433,"The compromised budget package, much like the negotiations we had on the Covid-19 relief bills, reflect our sincere efforts to bridge past divides, to chart a path forward and to turn the page and find a way for the leadership of the city to come together and tackle, seriously, the many issues that face constituents on this important issue, the civil rights movement facing us and as well, other priorities reflected in the Rebalanced package the city council considered over the summer.",47,,
386,0.97,4237.433,4240.002,This is an opportunity for us to do that and to try to move forward.,47,,
387,0.97,4240.002,4242.705,I want to highlight a couple of things.,47,,
388,0.97,4242.705,4255.784,"One, originally, one of our bills appropriated 14000000 to Hst in 2020 and a second appropriated of Participatory budget in 2020.",47,,
389,0.97,4255.784,4270.933,"Of course, the third set of amendments was related to layoffs and cuts to command staff salary among other issues including the navigation team impacts.",47,,
390,0.97,4270.933,4302.798,"Those were all issues that we continue to hear from the Mayor, a concern for her and we had an opportunity to hear from many constituents that there were concerns for them and this particular bill, I think, and again, if the override of the Mayor Vetoes failed, would allow us to move forward with a $2.5 million appropriation to the human services Department.",47,,
391,0.97,4302.798,4307.202,That would be granted through the Rfp process and dispersed to community partners in 2020.,47,,
392,0.97,4307.202,4317.946,"I continue to believe that if, given the option between $0 and $2.5 million, that I will choose the $2.5 million.",47,,
393,0.97,4317.946,4339.568,I would want the disbursement to occur but it has become very clear to us that the executive does not believe that using an Interfund loan is the appropriate course for this proposed spending in 2020.,47,,
394,0.97,4339.568,4361.824,"In other words, Mayor Durkan has made it very clear that in spite of this Council's allocation of $14 million to the human services Department, her administration did not intend to, nor would they spend any of these dollars as requested by the city Council, leaving the community was effectively a $0 investment in community safety initiatives.",47,,
395,0.97,4361.824,4366.695,I continue to believe it is the models we create through community safety.,47,,
396,0.97,4366.695,4382.745,"As a result of our ongoing conversations with the Mayor, my office secured an agreement with the Mayor that she would agree to spend $2.5 million over appropriated to the human services the Department that would be granted through the Rfp process and dispersed to community this year.",47,,
397,0.97,4382.745,4394.423,These dollars would be critical to support capacity building for Community-Based organizations and begin the capacity building.,47,,
398,0.97,4394.423,4406.435,"It's important for us to invest in these organizations to deliver public safety resources and programs that are a shared priority for the community, the Council and the Mayor for youth and gun violence prevention, among many other investments.",47,,
399,0.97,4406.435,4422.017,"Again, if the override vote fails, then this proposal, alternative proposal, also provides $1 million to a Participatory budget process for 2020.",47,,
400,0.97,4422.017,4423.018,This is a recognition of a couple of things.,47,,
401,0.97,4423.018,4439.034,"One, there is a real lack of resources in the 2020 budget and Secondly, the fact that only three months remain in the 2020-Year in which to appropriate and distribute these funds.",47,,
402,0.97,4439.034,4448.577,It creates a significant administration challenge to whether or not we actually can spend the entire original $3 million appropriation for 2020.,47,,
403,0.97,4448.577,4479.341,"For the remainder of 2020, it is possible that it might be necessary to right size the original $3 million appropriation for 2022 B $1 million and it's important for us to recall that when community partners propose and the Council attempted to fund $3 million for this process, it was intended to support a nearly nine month long Participatory budget process.",47,,
404,0.97,4479.341,4481.577,"Now, we are in a place where we only have three months left in this year.",47,,
405,0.97,4481.577,4495.39,This reduced level of spending acknowledges the reality that we only have three months left in the year and has right size the original investment for 2020 to $1 million.,47,,
406,0.97,4495.39,4512.441,"In total, the bill that is circulating this morning, for your consideration, will still allow for a total of $3 million to be invested in a Participatory budget process.",47,,
407,0.97,4512.441,4525.754,"Of course, council will have the opportunity to appropriate more funds in the 2021 adopted budget to support the Participatory budget processes and activities that will occur in 20 in 2021.",47,,
408,0.97,4525.754,4531.46,We all agree we don't think the Participatory budget process will only take three months.,47,,
409,0.97,4531.46,4556.184,It will inevitably go into next year and there will be resources needed for next year and the Mayor has agreed to identify and secure an additional $2 million for 2021 that will further save the Participatory budget process with a total investment of $3 million between 2020 and 2021 in the Participatory budgeting process.,47,,
410,0.97,4556.184,4583.912,"So, these are opportunities for us to not only--again--follow through and our commitment in a different way with the $3 million in the Participatory budget process being spent in 2020 and 2021, but this will allow us to structure a process to impact how the city will invest up to $100 million of investments the Mayor intends to invest in Bipoc communities across the city.",47,,
411,0.97,4583.912,4588.183,That is what is contained in this proposal that would be changes.,47,,
412,0.97,4588.183,4614.276,I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for her work on issues related to the navigation team that are reflected in the bill and would defer to her to make comments or remarks about what is included in this alternative bill that would be available for considerations related to the navigation team.,47,,
413,0.97,4614.276,4614.776,Councilmember Herbold?,47,,
414,0.97,4614.776,4615.11,Thank you.,48,,
415,0.97,4615.11,4618.38,I for two Councilmember Lewis.,48,,
416,0.97,4618.38,4640.369,I was involved in those discussions to appoint where elements would be necessary to confirm Hst and the executive's commitment to make significant policy changes.,48,,
417,0.97,4640.369,4680.275,"They were not received well by the executive and since the basis for my support continuing to fund the navigation team has always been and continues to be a commitment from the executive to continuous improvement of the policies associated with removal of Encampments, I withdrew from those discussions when it became clear that the executive was unwilling to commit to that ongoing continuous improvement.",48,,
418,0.97,4680.275,4694.489,"On one hand they said they were committed but on the other hand, unwilling to formalize that commitment beyond a verbal commitment.",48,,
419,0.97,4694.489,4695.424,"So, I handed over to Councilmember Lewis.",48,,
420,0.97,4695.424,4696.925,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold Herbold.",49,,
421,0.97,4696.925,4743.171,"I will share that it is an ongoing frustration, as well, on my side, too . given where some of those discussions went last week, and Unfortunately, where they resolved on Sunday in relation to some of the operational reforms all of us want to see in the navigation team, that said, there are significant and meaningful new things that are put on the table by the executive on the navigation team . It was as recently as the spring that would probably not have been on the table.",49,,
422,0.97,4743.171,4753.949,"I'm happy to share those things with the Council, now.",49,,
423,0.97,4753.949,4757.385,They are things that I believe are incorporated into the legislation and the Council President Gonzales has discuss them.,49,,
424,0.97,4757.385,4795.524,One of those things is an additional one-half million dollars for 2020 that will be offered for behavioral and mental health services and diversion and other important assets for the navigation team to be meaningfully responding to folks that are in need of behavioral mental health components or some kind of immediate diversion to get them into the hotel or into some kind of housing situation.,49,,
425,0.97,4795.524,4796.424,I stress again that it's just for 2020.,49,,
426,0.97,4796.424,4806.601,"There is a possibility of building on that and increasing for 2021, based on the way that we are funding it.",49,,
427,0.97,4806.601,4823.051,That is to eliminate five Ftes from the human services side of the navigation team to fund those additive services.,49,,
428,0.97,4823.051,4834.863,"It could carry over into 2021 and reduce personnel and increase services . For 2020, it would be one-half million dollars.",49,,
429,0.97,4834.863,4858.687,"The navigation team and Hst are going to look at ways to utilize the good neighbor agreements with certain Encampments, to allow Encampments to pursue some ways to work with the navigation team to potentially stay in place.",49,,
430,0.97,4858.687,4865.293,That is something they will report back to the Council on as part of this arrangement.,49,,
431,0.97,4865.293,4881.509,"Additionally, there is going to be a reduction of the police Ftes, of two Ftes.",49,,
432,0.97,4881.509,4889.484,This is something we continue going back and forth on with the executive to determine the total active police Ftes on the navigation team.,49,,
433,0.97,4889.484,4924.352,"As it stands, it's similar to the other reductions that we made in the fall to do specialty units, where the current vacancies on the navigation team for sworn personnel is two Ftes and eliminating those two that are vacant as manifested in the legislation, to reduce the police Footprint on the navigation team.",49,,
434,0.97,4924.352,4972.3,"Now, there's going to be some additional announcements that are going to be made in the near future for the navigation team in 2021 and what it will look like . It's in keeping with changes reducing the scope and the scale of Transitioning the role to be more of a coordination and Clearinghouse service for coordinating with service providers, rather than doing as much of the outreach as they have been . that Pivot for the last couple of months of 2020 is evident in some of these concessions that the executive is making in downsizing the personnel and expanding the amount of service offerings.",49,,
435,0.97,4972.3,4985.914,I would add that there is an additional commitment for $3 million of Non-Congregate shelter for 2020.,49,,
436,0.97,4985.914,5008.136,"And, a commitment from the executive to spend $3 million on Non-Congregate shelter . that is the update on the navigation team and I'm happy to answer questions and I'm sure that more information will come in today and tomorrow before any potential vote on this.",49,,
437,0.97,5008.136,5042.037,"In closing, I want to express similar frustrations to Councilmember Herbold with some other components and not being able to work their way into the satisfaction of all parties related to some of the other structural changes throughout a lot of us on the Council has been thinking about this, very real --",49,,
438,0.97,5042.037,5051.346,We lost Councilmember Lewis.,50,,
439,0.97,5051.346,5052.947,"If we can get you on via phone, we will make sure we do that.",50,,
440,0.97,5052.947,5096.458,"Colleagues, before I go ahead and have Alli and/or Dan walk through the procedural aspects of voting and voting requirements for tomorrow's special committee meeting, I want to say in broad strokes that I continue to support the original actions that we took in the summer, the budget balancing exercise.",50,,
441,0.97,5104.265,5126.121,I believe the amendments were measured but important mechanisms to advance the goal to continue to respond to community partner calls to address this issue of racial recognizing facing us across the country.,50,,
442,0.97,5126.121,5142.57,I continue to stand by what we did this summer and I believe those were the right policy choices . I do continue--will continue to support the actions that we took over the summer.,50,,
443,0.97,5142.57,5145.373,"Nonetheless, because --",50,,
444,0.97,5145.373,5152.28,I'm back.,51,,
445,0.97,5152.28,5153.148,"I had technical difficulties, folks.",51,,
446,0.97,5153.148,5153.948,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",52,,
447,0.97,5153.948,5194.622,"Nonetheless, because the Council operates in open public sessions and because there have been some members of the Council who have expressed concerns about a path forward and about the possibility of changing their position on the budget that we considered before recess, and appropriate for us to have an alternative proposal in front of the Council for consideration.",53,,
448,0.97,5194.622,5212.307,"For the mayors over right, for this alternative approach, it's not an opportunity to undermine what we did this summer.",53,,
449,0.97,5212.307,5257.785,"It's an opportunity for us to acknowledge that if an override of the Mayor's veto fails, then effectively, all of the work we did in the summer will be completely erased . I think it's important to try to find agreement where we can find it and for those things agreed upon, if the Council wishes to consider it and to pass it by the requisite number of votes, we will have an opportunity to move forward and put ourselves on the path towards still continuing to work on many of the important policy issues that this Council has expressed are a priority for us.",53,,
450,0.97,5257.785,5266.194,"So, Dan, do you want to handle the issues related to the number of votes and then we will own it up for comments by Council members?",53,,
451,0.97,5266.194,5271.966,Sure.,54,,
452,0.97,5271.966,5275.103,I'd be happy to do that in a summary way.,54,,
453,0.97,5275.103,5280.208,"If there are questions about any of the three particular bills, I'd be happy to do my best to address those questions.",54,,
454,0.97,5280.208,5299.394,"In summary, I would say that the Council President has talked about what it would take to override the Mayor's veto of the three budget bills.",54,,
455,0.97,5299.394,5306.634,"In brief, it would take six votes on reconsideration to override the Mayor's veto.",54,,
456,0.97,5306.634,5328.256,"It would, however, take seven votes for two of the three bills to become operable for the appropriations in the bills to become legally--legal authority to spend money.",54,,
457,0.97,5328.256,5343.671,"Those are Council bills 119825 described as the overall budget bill, and also, council bill Tran28 62.",54,,
458,0.97,5343.671,5345.473,That's the $3 million to the legislative Department for community led work.,54,,
459,0.97,5345.473,5369.964,"The last bill, council bill 119863 is the $13.1 million Interfund alone and because that bill doesn't include appropriations, it would also take six votes to override the Mayor's veto.",54,,
460,0.97,5369.964,5374.268,It wouldn't need a seventh vote to become operable.,54,,
461,0.97,5374.268,5376.671,Six votes would be sufficient both for the override to become effective and for Operability.,54,,
462,0.97,5376.671,5384.512,That is my attempt to summarize more complexity than it even sounds like.,54,,
463,0.97,5384.512,5386.347,"But, I can answer any questions folks may have.",54,,
464,0.97,5386.347,5389.016,"Okay, colleagues.",55,,
465,0.97,5389.016,5393.421,Any questions for Alli or Dan?,55,,
466,0.97,5393.421,5393.888,Councilmember Sawant?,55,,
467,0.97,5393.888,5405.767,"I don't have questions for Dan but I have important comments on this issue and a question for the staff, but not the Council.",56,,
468,0.97,5405.767,5406.067,Please.,57,,
469,0.97,5406.067,5415.71,"If there is no questions for Dan or Alli, and they are available to you off-line.",57,,
470,0.97,5415.71,5416.677,"But, go ahead, Councilmember Sawant, please.",57,,
471,0.97,5416.677,5425.453,"Thank you, president Gonzales.",58,,
472,0.97,5425.453,5426.687,I'm a little--more than a little perplexed or Nonplussed.,58,,
473,0.97,5426.687,5450.711,I received this bill and because it seems to me--there is a strong assumption that the override will not be successful override off Mayor Durkan's veto.,58,,
474,0.97,5450.711,5463.09,I appreciate Councilmember and solace that you made very clear that you support the override.,58,,
475,0.97,5463.09,5465.96,I intend to support the override of the veto.,58,,
476,0.97,5465.96,5469.897,We haven't heard from many other Council members and I would assume they would override the veto.,58,,
477,0.97,5469.897,5478.573,Do we have a sufficient number of votes to override it?,58,,
478,0.97,5478.573,5488.616,"Obviously, as you know, I strongly agree that we want to get as much as we can get without regarding a veto.",58,,
479,0.97,5488.616,5489.584,I don't understand the bargaining strategy.,58,,
480,0.97,5489.584,5506.968,"For those willing to override the veto, I don't understand the bargaining strategy to already say that here is another bill that could relate to many things if the override doesn't succeed.",58,,
481,0.97,5506.968,5514.041,There is no incentive for Council members who may intend to not support the override on the veto.,58,,
482,0.97,5514.041,5520.147,I have a specific question to Council members.,58,,
483,0.97,5520.147,5524.418,I think you have an obligation to state publicly where you stand now.,58,,
484,0.97,5524.418,5536.13,"Not now at the briefing, not tomorrow, but it's not correct for Council members to surprise members of the public on which way they are going to vote.",58,,
485,0.97,5536.13,5548.91,It seems that there is guidance on how they would vote and I have not been part of these discussions.,58,,
486,0.97,5548.91,5554.815,"On behalf of members of the public, I'm asking Council members to publicly say now where they stand.",58,,
487,0.97,5554.815,5556.951,Are they planning to support the override of the veto and to sustain the veto?,58,,
488,0.97,5556.951,5562.723,"In which case, we would need an alternate bill.",58,,
489,0.97,5562.723,5563.224,I will end on this.,58,,
490,0.97,5563.224,5603.931,"Specifically, it's important that members of the public understand that the bill has been Emailed to the Council yesterday and I accept what Councilmember Gonzales says, that is still changing . I appreciate that but even as it stands right now, it significantly is rolling back the small and Progressive changes by the summer budget vote and rolls back the tiny Defunding of the police and rolls back the stopping of the Sweeps and rolls back investments but does not rollback the austerity.",58,,
491,0.97,5603.931,5604.699,I would push back against this.,58,,
492,0.97,5604.699,5613.641,"In my view, it's been a Sleight- Of-Hand and also Councilmember Lewis made some points.",58,,
493,0.97,5613.641,5614.442,I want to report from Alli's memo.,58,,
494,0.97,5614.442,5619.347,"To reduce the budget by $216,000.",58,,
495,0.97,5619.347,5624.151,Assume 14 FTE reductions for the team.,58,,
496,0.97,5624.151,5642.169,"This bill, the alternate bill, cuts $15,000 and assumes a 2.0 FTE reduction in personnel assigned to the team and the positions are currently vacant.",58,,
497,0.97,5642.169,5644.839,These are not even positions that are vacant.,58,,
498,0.97,5644.839,5653.748,Look at the stark difference.,58,,
499,0.97,5653.748,5670.464,"For the August recess, it was not sufficient but was a good start and now the alternate bill is far, far less than that.",58,,
500,0.97,5670.464,5681.542,I want to push forward as much as possible but I don't understand the strategy of putting this forward before Council members have had any pressure to stay publicly standing on the override and how they plan to move around it.,58,,
501,0.97,5681.542,5683.711,Thank you.,58,,
502,0.97,5683.711,5685.579,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",59,,
503,0.97,5685.579,5691.419,Any other comments or questions?,59,,
504,0.97,5691.419,5697.958,Councilmember Herbold and a hand from Councilmember Mosqueda?,59,,
505,0.97,5697.958,5698.426,Thank you.,60,,
506,0.97,5698.426,5728.055,"Council President, you had Referenced the reduction in community research, the project investment from the previous Council approve, 3000000 to $1 Millon but there is a commitment from the executive to recognize that that work will be going into 2021.",60,,
507,0.97,5728.055,5731.459,"There is a commitment from the executive to provide additional funding necessary in 2021, $2 million.",60,,
508,0.97,5731.459,5746.207,Can you talk about in what form that commitment exists? I have concerns about verbal commitments that are not memorialized.,60,,
509,0.97,5746.207,5752.246,"As mentioned earlier, related to the navigation team.",60,,
510,0.97,5752.246,5754.648,I would love to hear a little more about that.,60,,
511,0.97,5754.648,5768.095,"At this juncture, it is a verbal commitment and there have been Emails that have memorialized that to my office.",61,,
512,0.97,5768.095,5794.421,"As I mentioned, at the top of this alternate bill, should it be needed, I'm happy to have my staff talk to the Mayor's staff about incorporating that commitment in this alternate bill as part of the agreement, should the alternative bill be necessary because of the voting thresholds that would be required to make the three bills operable, effectively.",61,,
513,0.97,5794.421,5810.07,"So, I'm happy--and hopefully, my staff is listening--to have them immediately get off the phone and go talk to the Úmayor's office around some language that we can incorporate with that commitment.",61,,
514,0.97,5810.07,5828.656,"I appreciate the need and the desire and the interest, to want to Memorialize that in alternate bills so we have a high level of confidence that the $3 million, in total, will come to fruition.",61,,
515,0.97,5828.656,5832.126,Thank you.,62,,
516,0.97,5832.126,5834.595,Councilmember Mosqueda and Councilmember Morales?,63,,
517,0.97,5834.595,5841.836,"Thank you, Council President.",64,,
518,0.97,5841.836,5848.275,I appreciate the opportunity to ask some questions.,64,,
519,0.97,5848.275,5857.985,"The process of this Council under your leadership encourages us to ask questions as central staff during these Council briefings, if that's correct.",64,,
520,0.97,5857.985,5860.221,"I have a few questions, four.",64,,
521,0.97,5860.221,5865.626,"First, I, too, am hopeful that this Council will continue to move forward and to override the veto.",64,,
522,0.97,5865.626,5883.611,"I think it's important for us as a counselor, and as a body, to provide education to the community that what we did in the rebalancing package was a 1% reduction, less than a 1% reduction to the SPD budget.",64,,
523,0.97,5883.611,5888.449,"It was $3 million, reduced from a $400 million budget.",64,,
524,0.97,5888.449,5897.324,The Mayor's office has acknowledged that about 95% of the cuts that were done to SPD were done because of what she had put forward.,64,,
525,0.97,5897.324,5904.064,The remaining small amount we are talking about is really symbolic in nature.,64,,
526,0.97,5904.064,5923.984,"It's symbolic in our efforts to move forward the conversation demanded across the country, for us to reevaluate what public safety looks like and to try to right size investments into communities and to recognize there are many situations that 911 is called for and individuals do not need to show up with a gun.",64,,
527,0.97,5923.984,5924.752,We need mental health counselors.,64,,
528,0.97,5924.752,5940.334,"We need cross lists intervention counselors to be having more public safety servants to come to the call for 911, but not necessarily someone with a gun.",64,,
529,0.97,5940.334,5948.909,"It was a small investment, a down payment into what needs to be a more robust conversation.",64,,
530,0.97,5948.909,5950.978,"That effort can continue, as the Council President Mnsion.",64,,
531,0.97,5950.978,5968.362,"There are ongoing conversations about those next steps and I believe this budget could move forward and we could continue to engage in a conversation about what 2021 looks like in a more robust conversation, as we had proposed with the Participatory budgeting process.",64,,
532,0.97,5968.362,5987.314,"I'm hopeful that we continue to show that this improvement in how we hear community and engage in the almost 300 organizations, organizations, ask Councilmember Herbold reminded us, it was more than one or two organizations.",64,,
533,0.97,5987.314,5990.317,They were coalitions with large Swaths of the public.,64,,
534,0.97,5990.317,5993.687,My hope is we continue supporting the efforts we put forward.,64,,
535,0.97,5993.687,5994.755,I'd like to ask about the proposal in front of us.,64,,
536,0.97,5994.755,6017.411,"If the override is not gone successfully, for Council, Cntral staff, would you say that the cuts being proposed, changes being proposed in the budget and the document in front of us is limited to just SPD related issues?",64,,
537,0.97,6017.411,6018.345,Councilmember Mosqueda?,65,,
538,0.97,6018.345,6025.652,"To clarify, I'm not sure I understand the question.",65,,
539,0.97,6025.652,6037.798,"Is the difference between what is suggested if the override is not successful or changes not listed related to SPD, or broader than SPD?",66,,
540,0.97,6037.798,6053.781,The differences between the revised bill are related to Hstv.,67,,
541,0.97,6058.752,6076.703,"The Provisos, it's what I would describe as technical changes related to the appropriation changes for OCR and the trail funding.",67,,
542,0.97,6076.703,6095.923,"Those funds for the purposes for the funding, to support the Sodo trail is in this replacement bill.",67,,
543,0.97,6100.561,6132.359,"Within the SPD bucket, the main issues raised at the press conference, the salary with 100 Ftes, can you confirm that the cuts and changes have been put back into place for security and the resource offers Sir, is it broader than those things mentioned at the press conference?",67,,
544,0.97,6132.359,6134.127,I think you may have more details on what was invested.,68,,
545,0.97,6134.127,6146.24,There were a number of Provisos that restricted spending and all of those areas and all of those Provisos are removed from the replacement bill.,68,,
546,0.97,6146.24,6179.673,"In part, it is just a practical reality that Council bill 119825 assumed, Procedurally, that layoff notices would be issued at a certain time but from where we expected that to happen and practically speaking, it would be difficult to implement those Provisos and even if the veto--if you vote to override the Vetoes, there may need to be modifications because of those practical realities.",68,,
547,0.97,6179.673,6186.18,"I know you spoke to that on the Council President did, as well, regarding the timing.",69,,
548,0.97,6186.18,6187.581,Is it mostly the timing that was an issue on those other pieces?,69,,
549,0.97,6187.581,6190.284,Yes.,70,,
550,0.97,6190.284,6201.128,"I think that is a fair way to characterize the issue . all of the Provisos would have required notices to staff, effective staff.",70,,
551,0.97,6201.128,6209.77,"We anticipated a minimum, an expected period of three months.",70,,
552,0.97,6209.77,6222.916,"In mid-September, that effectively doesn't leave enough time to recoup the salary savings that would flow from those layoffs in 2020.",70,,
553,0.97,6222.916,6237.598,"As a quick reminder, will our Provisos assume that on August 1, the notice of the layoffs, that it would go to officers under the direction of the chief of police.",71,,
554,0.97,6237.598,6238.966,It's now September 14 and no layoff notices have been issued.,71,,
555,0.97,6238.966,6271.031,"We've continued to be at an impasse to the Mayor, related to out of order layoff issues and to address concerns related to what happens to hires and the reality that without an exception to the seniority rule, that we could Backslide in some of the progress we made around additional diverse recruitment at the Seattle police Department.",71,,
556,0.97,6271.031,6285.612,The change in this alternate bill acknowledges--does not modify with the Council has issued to be its policy priority.,71,,
557,0.97,6285.612,6293.82,"It does, however, Memorialize that, operationally, we are not going to be able to effectuate the intent of these Provisos.",71,,
558,0.97,6293.82,6312.239,"We need at least three months to get an understanding of whether or not this would come to fruition and be real . at this point, it does not appear that we can fulfill that.",71,,
559,0.97,6312.239,6334.127,"Of course, we know the Provisos were structured such that if the three month layoff was not effectuated, we would have, as a Council, had to reconsider lifting the Provisos on November 1, in any event.",71,,
560,0.97,6334.127,6358.719,"This is acknowledging that we have a sort of timing issue and also, incorporating any alternate bill with a Memorialize commitment and Pathway forward on how the Council will work with the executive and the chief on addressing issues related to out of order layoffs, done through the policy committee body.",71,,
561,0.97,6358.719,6378.071,Five members of this Council sit on it and several members of the executives do and we will work with labor relations in that Venue to effectuate the intent of looking at the size of the sworn personnel staffing at the Seattle police Department.,71,,
562,0.97,6378.071,6382.676,"Thank you, Council president and thank you for the reminder that we have the valve included for the November date.",72,,
563,0.97,6382.676,6396.69,My last question is that we had intentionally included $4 million for gun violence prevention and this was one of the issues also noted during the veto press conference.,72,,
564,0.97,6396.69,6407.567,It's really important to note that the $4 million we put in was intentionally working as community members in diverse sectors had asked us to address gun violence prevention.,72,,
565,0.97,6407.567,6416.51,As a $4 million still part of their proposed package if the veto is not overwritten?,72,,
566,0.97,6416.51,6440.834,"Councilmember, there were two separate appropriations and Provisos describing the intent and one was for $10 million and one was $4 million for what you just described.",73,,
567,0.97,6440.834,6451.411,There is now $82 million total for Hst for community led investments and it lists a number of potential purposes.,73,,
568,0.97,6451.411,6476.803,It doesn't prohibit the use for that investment but isn't specifically for those but includes no responding to high violence communities and I would talk to you off-line to understand if their language is inclusive enough of your intent.,73,,
569,0.97,6476.803,6487.08,"Thank you, Madam President.",74,,
570,0.97,6487.08,6488.882,Thank you so much.,75,,
571,0.97,6488.882,6490.417,"Earlier, I submitted September 14 but it is actually September 21.",75,,
572,0.97,6490.417,6500.126,I took us back to a seven-day time machine.,75,,
573,0.97,6500.126,6500.627,Councilmember Herbold?,75,,
574,0.97,6500.627,6519.679,"It's a follow-up question, Councilmember Gonzales, it's the discussion around out of order layoffs and the Council unanimously supporting a goal to reduce the size of the police department by 100 officers.",76,,
575,0.97,6519.679,6526.553,"And, the removal of that Council intent by removing the Provisos.",76,,
576,0.97,6526.553,6531.458,I do understand the timing issue.,76,,
577,0.97,6531.458,6544.471,I appreciate that we do have a commitment from the executive to pursue out of order layoffs.,76,,
578,0.97,6544.471,6578.805,"I don't quite understand--as I read it, it's an agreement in principle that we should work together to see that the chief can submit requests for out of order layoffs, but without there being a stated policy goal to reduce the size of the Department by laying off officers . I don't understand how that agreement, as relates to the out of order layoffs is triggered.",76,,
579,0.97,6578.805,6620.113,"I also want to fly, as it relates to the reports that our previous legislation required, one of the reports, as I understood it, was to look specifically at how specialty units could be eliminated and reduced and expanded . It Aligns with the Council's unanimous decision as relates to the 2020 reductions and the interest in reducing or eliminating some specialty units.",76,,
580,0.97,6620.113,6632.359,Just wondering whether or not that kind of work is still work that we are asking SPD to move forward?,76,,
581,0.97,6632.359,6663.356,"Because, again, I think the community vision that we have been hearing through the rebalancing process, from large coalitions like King County equity now and Decriminalize Seattle, goes beyond the commitment to freeze hiring to fill vacancies.",76,,
582,0.97,6663.356,6677.671,It is a broader systemic and structural look at the Department and the Footprint of the Department Department.,76,,
583,0.97,6677.671,6684.344,"Not just 911 response, but this issue I've mentioned around specialty units.",76,,
584,0.97,6684.344,6710.637,"Councilmember Herbold, section 20 of the revised budget revision ordinance States that by establishing this section, they extend the intent to reduce the overall size of the city police force and they go on to list the expectations in requesting some work for recommendations to eliminate, reduce, civilian eyes or expand . that's in section 20 of the bill I distributed.",77,,
585,0.97,6710.637,6712.839,I appreciate it.,78,,
586,0.97,6712.839,6724.484,Thank you for highlighting that section and Councilmember Herbold's observations.,79,,
587,0.97,6724.484,6749.008,"I agree with your observation that a commitment to pursue out of order layoffs is an empty commitment if we aren't hearing a commitment about deeply evaluating these issues around the size of the police force and whether or not certain functions need to be eliminated, reduced or transferred, etc.",79,,
588,0.97,6749.008,6768.528,"Section 20 does Memorialize a commitment to engage in that analysis and to include Council in that analysis, as opposed to having the executive in the police Department do it without city council.",79,,
589,0.97,6768.528,6796.122,"So, I think that's an opportunity for us to engage in that interdepartmental team process . to engage in that process and to require that that report be publicly accessible, so that we can have the data available to us that will be necessary to answer the questions and address many concerns you have highlighted.",79,,
590,0.97,6796.122,6797.257,"Colleagues, any other comments or questions?",80,,
591,0.97,6797.257,6799.726,Councilmember Morales?,80,,
592,0.97,6799.726,6811.171,"Council President, I want to echo your remarks about continuing to support the work of this Council and of the budget chair over the summer.",81,,
593,0.97,6811.171,6830.023,I think we were very deliberate and cautious in listening to the communities and what they are feeling and thinking about the direction the city needs to go.,81,,
594,0.97,6830.023,6845.171,"As it relates to community safety and what that could look like, as we've all said, this was a very small down payment on some important structural work that we need to do . This process is just beginning.",81,,
595,0.97,6845.171,6858.585,"It was an important beginning and I do think it's really important that we need to stand committed to what we have discussed and what we have shared with community, already.",81,,
596,0.97,6858.585,6891.684,"That said, I want to echo Councilmember Herbold's concern about making sure that we have clear commitments from the executive about the work that her office will support, including an additional $2 million in 2021 for the Participatory budget process and additional community investment, since if we don't override the veto's, those are things that are not included as presented now, anyway.",81,,
597,0.97,6891.684,6899.425,I do want to talk for a moment about the navigation team.,81,,
598,0.97,6899.425,6903.062,Our office worked really hard to try to make important structural changes.,81,,
599,0.97,6903.062,6916.109,"We had an amendment that would have removed the police from the navigation team with the proposal that has just leaving positions vacant, which is not the kind of structural change we look for.",81,,
600,0.97,6916.109,6936.896,"Amendment 40 did Defund the navigation team entirely with a commitment to invest, instead, in our service providers that are already doing this work and doing it well but need additional resources to do that, especially as we see increases in the homeless population.",81,,
601,0.97,6936.896,6946.673,"What we are left with, instead, it is a $500,000 proviso that will fund mental health services and diversion and rapid Rehousing.",81,,
602,0.97,6946.673,6950.677,It effectively preserves the funding for the navigation team.,81,,
603,0.97,6950.677,6959.719,That is not something that I personally feel--and many of our constituents feel is serving our homeless community very well at all.,81,,
604,0.97,6959.719,6981.874,"I'm interested, and maybe central staff can clarify this for me--I didn't see in the proposal we had before us if there was any shift in giving the navigation team Prioritization access to shelter and services.",81,,
605,0.97,6981.874,6991.551,"What we are trying come at the very least, is to see that our service providers can gain access to available shelter without having to go through the navigation team.",81,,
606,0.97,6991.551,7006.232,I know there was some language for the lead program . I'm wondering if that would be the case for other service providers.,81,,
607,0.97,7006.232,7015.608,"Councilmember Morales, there is no language in the bill that Prioritizes access to shelter spaces for service providers, in the service providers.",82,,
608,0.97,7015.608,7033.726,"In the proviso related to the $500,000 for the mental health services diversion and rapid Rehousing funding, that is Prioritized for access for the navigation team to access, specifically.",82,,
609,0.97,7033.726,7038.331,That is the only language related to Prioritization.,82,,
610,0.97,7038.331,7051.844,"Councilmember Morales, I'm happy to talk to you more Off- line about that priority you just expressed, to see if there is a needle we could thread.",83,,
611,0.97,7051.844,7072.698,"I will say that in my conversations with folks, it seems that there are some clear gaps with access to resources for important services, and to meaningfully connect people to something better.",83,,
612,0.97,7072.698,7095.822,"That has focused around the need to have additional resources for mental health professionals and also, to individuals who are qualified to diagnose folks in the field, if they are experiencing or using substances.",83,,
613,0.97,7095.822,7105.498,"There has to be a certification to get those folks connected to the services that might be available to them, should they want to take advantage of those services.",83,,
614,0.97,7105.498,7110.236,That is also a service gap in the current model.,83,,
615,0.97,7110.236,7135.962,"Then, the reference to rapid Rehousing, I would say that is creating a connection between a level of Prioritization of eight different housing alternatives for those individuals experiencing homelessness, currently, and I would also acknowledge that $500,000 is, obviously, not enough and will not meet the scale of the need.",83,,
616,0.97,7135.962,7151.277,"It is an entry point into acknowledging that these kinds of services are currently missing from the model and are absolutely necessary, in order to meet the needs of those individuals experiencing homelessness and Unsanctioned Encampments.",83,,
617,0.97,7151.277,7158.15,I'm happy to talk more about that.,83,,
618,0.97,7158.15,7170.229,"Councilmember Herbold, I was Remiss in acknowledging that you removed a particular language that would require reports and proviso funding of the navigation team, and less those reports were filed.",83,,
619,0.97,7170.229,7199.859,"I wanted to publicly acknowledge that when I saw that language, I was supportive and continued to be supportive of the policy goals and intent and look forward to that if that is not something we are going to consider in this particular alternative path should it be necessary, then I certainly would want to and would be happy to consider and have a conversation about that language and that intent in the fall budget process that we are about to embark on in a week.",83,,
620,0.97,7199.859,7214.674,"We could look at longer term planning and goals related to the navigation team and the structure and funding, etc.",83,,
621,0.97,7214.674,7227.553,"I wanted to signal publicly that I very much supported your policy direction on that point and, hopefully, we won't lose sight of those policy goals and can consider them in the fall budget process.",83,,
622,0.97,7227.553,7240.399,"Madam President, sorry, but if I could jumping on this, too, if there is a second.",84,,
623,0.97,7240.399,7242.568,Go ahead.,85,,
624,0.97,7242.568,7246.272,Go for it and then and we will hear from Councilmember Mosqueda.,85,,
625,0.97,7246.272,7247.974,Thank you.,86,,
626,0.97,7247.974,7277.47,"I would add that as far as the $500,000 for behavioral mental health and investments, rapid Rehousing and if I could be corrected if I'm wrong, consistent with a best practice recommended by an audit of the navigation team that that is a resource that the team should have access to, that has been depleted.",86,,
627,0.97,7277.47,7282.575,Like the diversion of funds from the city had been depleted the last couple of years.,86,,
628,0.97,7282.575,7285.711,That has had a big impact on the ability of the navigation team to provide that service.,86,,
629,0.97,7285.711,7293.185,"It's sort of in keeping with the spirit of that, of that audit, to provide that service.",86,,
630,0.97,7293.185,7339.765,"I would add that there is going to be some additional ideas coming down from the executive around the navigation team and that conversation in the 2021 budget process would actually be a really sound idea and a good conversation in conjunction for deploying resources, given that there are going to be responses regarding the navigation team over the last several months.",86,,
631,0.97,7342.902,7367.56,It has been this idea of using the navigation team for centralized resources to coordinate service provider partners and to put more of that outreach focus on community.,86,,
632,0.97,7367.56,7384.677,"To your comment about the $500,000 being not nearly enough, I completely concur on that.",86,,
633,0.97,7388.581,7407.666,"The services have decisions for the 2021 budget and it will carry over . $500,000 for these last couple of months of 2020. I just wanted to get all that out there.",86,,
634,0.97,7407.666,7408.501,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",87,,
635,0.97,7408.501,7437.997,"I want to acknowledge that there is language in the alternate bill that assumes an automatic carryforward of any amounts not spent in 2020 and those Amonts will be assumed in 2021. so, I just want to acknowledge that that language currently exists in the alternate bill, should it be necessary for the Council to consider this alternate bill.",87,,
636,0.97,7437.997,7439.131,"Any other comments or questions, colleagues?",87,,
637,0.97,7439.131,7441.734,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you had your hand up?",87,,
638,0.97,7441.734,7443.435,"Thank you, Madam President.",88,,
639,0.97,7443.435,7448.073,A question about process.,88,,
640,0.97,7448.073,7453.379,Perhaps this is for central staff.,88,,
641,0.97,7453.379,7454.814,"I understand from our conversation, the concerns around the delay.",88,,
642,0.97,7454.814,7475.434,"It's 1.5 months since we passed the budget and the concerns around the proviso language not lining up with where cost savings could be . I understand the delay on the bargaining process, as we've been discussing with the need to initiate bargaining.",88,,
643,0.97,7475.434,7483.108,It's important language for the feedback we've received from officers who would like to retire early but have no other health care options.,88,,
644,0.97,7483.108,7494.153,"It's the desire to see a bridge for them to get to Medicare, something that was part of the discussion and embedded into the legislation we've passed.",88,,
645,0.97,7494.153,7498.591,"We can offer some officers that would like to retire early, that opportunity.",88,,
646,0.97,7498.591,7506.599,"I can understand on those two pieces that the timing might not line up, given the delay in the veto and not signing the bill.",88,,
647,0.97,7506.599,7509.568,We now have dates that don't correspond.,88,,
648,0.97,7509.568,7518.544,"My question, though, for central staff, if the veto were to be overridden, could we not do a follow-up piece of legislation to make the changes necessary to the dates?",88,,
649,0.97,7518.544,7529.822,"Or, even specific policy changes that we may now want to see?",88,,
650,0.97,7529.822,7536.729,"For example, related to executive pay or being more specific about where the ft reduction should come from with the NAB team?",88,,
651,0.97,7536.729,7547.439,Is it not possible to override the veto and then have a trailer bill addressing those pieces?,88,,
652,0.97,7547.439,7551.577,"Councilmember Mosqueda, we can do all of those things or what we did in the summer all over again.",89,,
653,0.97,7551.577,7558.017,The alternate bill represents a bill that I believe will not be subject to a veto.,89,,
654,0.97,7558.017,7565.791,"Again, you know, any of us as Council members are welcome to introduce any other bill.",89,,
655,0.97,7565.791,7573.165,Those bills will be subject to the same veto scrutiny than any other bills would be.,89,,
656,0.97,7573.165,7593.552,"I'm proposing, as an alternate, is a bill and a package that I have heard directly from the Mayor on, that she will not veto, this alternate bill, should it be considered and passed by the city council.",89,,
657,0.97,7593.552,7610.669,"Again, all of the paths that you've described, we could certainly Revisit them and basically we do what we did in the summer but they would be subject to the same danger of a veto power that the Mayor has, that the prior bills were subject to.",89,,
658,0.97,7610.669,7625.951,"Now, if there is a Pathway for you to speak directly to the Mayor and her staff about proposed shifts, then, obviously, that is something I would leave to you and your staff to negotiate with the Mayor.",89,,
659,0.97,7625.951,7638.964,"And, hopefully, to find a Pathway to get those policies through without the policies being vetoed.",89,,
660,0.97,7638.964,7647.272,Any other comments or questions before we go ahead and close out Council briefing?,89,,
661,0.97,7647.272,7648.54,It is 11:40 A.M.,89,,
662,0.97,7648.54,7655.114,And--Councilmember Sawant?,89,,
663,0.97,7655.114,7655.381,Yes.,90,,
664,0.97,7655.381,7669.595,"I just had a question that occurred t me, based on what you said, president Gonzales.",90,,
665,0.97,7669.595,7679.471,"If the city council overrode the Mayor's veto, than those bills stand.",90,,
666,0.97,7679.471,7680.339,Am I correct from a legal standpoint?,90,,
667,0.97,7680.339,7680.572,Yep.,91,,
668,0.97,7680.572,7687.012,That is correct.,91,,
669,0.97,7687.012,7689.214,The appropriations would stand.,91,,
670,0.97,7689.214,7694.219,Nothing in the bills require the Mayor to spend any of the money that we have allocated.,91,,
671,0.97,7694.219,7694.92,"That's always true, yes.",92,,
672,0.97,7694.92,7695.154,Yes.,93,,
673,0.97,7695.154,7695.621,That is always true.,93,,
674,0.97,7695.621,7699.625,You are correct.,93,,
675,0.97,7699.625,7711.437,"If the override is successful, or doesn't fail, then the original bills, as passed by the city council would effectively be walked.",93,,
676,0.97,7711.437,7712.438,I'm glad we are clarifying that.,94,,
677,0.97,7712.438,7720.312,"So far, not all Council members have stated where they stand on the override, publicly.",94,,
678,0.97,7720.312,7729.354,"I want to know that if they overrode the veto, that would stand?",94,,
