53,0.97,345.311,348.715,I describe the different feelings you get from those strains and types.,9,,
54,0.97,348.715,369.936,I decided to join the industry because in the middle of the industry I was laid off from my job like many others and I found I have a chronic pain disease so I really dove into the medical side of Cannabis for my own personal use and I'm passionate about sharing what I learned because it's a really powerful plant.,9,,
55,0.97,369.936,381.714,I saw this as an opportunity to pursue the passion of mine as well as get on the inside of the Cannabis industry because there's a lot of equity work that needs to be done.,9,,
56,0.97,381.714,396.496,I believe that the training that this Cannabis equity policy offers will be really helpful to open the Gateway for workers especially to different avenues and fields within the industry.,9,,
57,0.97,396.496,407.64,It gives them the opportunity to see what they would be good at and just develop a ladder for workers to move up within the industry chain.,9,,

59,0.97,420.686,429.162,This is not accessible because it's so expensive and you have to renew it every year to be considered certified by the state.,9,,

90,0.97,585.084,595.795,One component that put me at ease is the fact that a Cannabis equity Commission is developed and who it consisted of.,13,,
91,0.97,595.795,597.163,It makes me more comfortable.,13,,
92,0.97,597.163,605.738,It will allocate funds in an equitable way and they are from the communities or closely associated with the communities that have been wronged.,13,,
93,0.97,605.738,611.777,This policy dedicated Afters to people of color and opens door in inaccessible injuries.,13,,

172,0.97,1181.146,1218.25,"Since then, working more broadly and financial empowerment, I've really come to know housing stability is at the core of financial empowerment work so my efforts have focused more on that area of housing and really excited to be able to ensure resources part of the levy are supporting the goals and hoping to bring a lens of Homeowner ship and how programs are working and also increasing equity in access to Homeowner ship is an important thing I hope to bring to the work.",24,,
173,0.97,1218.25,1219.551,Thank you.,24,,
174,0.97,1219.551,1221.887,Thank you so much.,25,,

177,0.97,1234.333,1235.233,"All right, Dan.",25,,
178,0.97,1235.233,1287.386,"So the opposite of home Enner ship, my name is Dan wise deputy director at Catholic community services for over two decades I've worked with folks experiencing homelessness in our community and through that work I've seen that there's nothing more Trans formative in a person's live than being able to have a home and sustain that home and so really excited and I have had the opportunity of developing housing using the Seattle housing levy funds and the ability to open a building and welcome folks into their new home is just amazing and Ooum really excited to work with my former colleague, Damien and the other members of the Committee on this.",25,,
179,0.97,1287.386,1287.653,Thank you.,25,,
180,0.97,1287.653,1295.093,Thank you and a founding board member of Commons is that right?,26,,
181,0.97,1295.093,1295.327,Yes.,27,,
182,0.97,1295.327,1299.831,Thank you all Stephanie I'll turn it back to you for concluding comments.,28,,
183,0.97,1299.831,1303.368,I see there's questions from the committee.,28,,
184,0.97,1303.368,1303.602,Sure.,29,,
185,0.97,1303.602,1319.518,Just wanted to note again patience wasn't able to join us but she's our fifth new appointee you're all familiar with patience work she's the new executive director of the housing development and I'm sure you will see her again soon.,29,,
186,0.97,1319.518,1343.642,"The last thing I wanted to say here and Joel alluded to this with the end of the 7-Year term for the 2016 housing levy coming to a close next year, the housing levy oversight committee is going to be asked to share their diverse knowledge, expertise and experience as we plan for renewal of the housing levy in 2023 so it's a really important time to have some great people on the committee so thank you.",29,,
187,0.97,1343.975,1346.178,.,29,,
188,0.97,1346.178,1365.163,Very well said and the timing is so critical for us to both be planning for 2023 but also I think sharing with the community what the housing levy has been able to accomplish and in doing so also talking about what more could be done and should be done.,30,,
189,0.97,1365.163,1394.86,"Do any of you have any thoughts about some of the things that you would like to Prioritize in anticipation of the conversation we're having with folks next year about the things you would really like to highlight as well done or things that you would like to continue to see growth and as we think about what that next it ration looks like, anything that really Excites you at this moment in time in joining the housing levy oversight board.",30,,
190,0.97,1394.86,1403.402,& GT;.,31,,
191,0.97,1403.402,1421.219,The one thing that is very obvious to those in the field is the office of housing and city of Seattle is the leader in providing affordable funds not just through the levy but Mha and other things.,32,,
192,0.97,1421.219,1454.019,"The city through Stephanie said has continually supported this so I think our jobs being stewards of this is as Krit al as ever with rising construction costs and limited land prices so I think as much as we enjoy the support, I think we need to continue to really be good stewards and insure the trust of the public is remaining so that the levy continues to shine.",32,,
193,0.97,1454.019,1463.461,I don't think there's been real big controversies that I've seen whether it's the levy or anything with city supporting.,32,,
194,0.97,1463.461,1468.667,Never enough money but I think there's a lot of opportunities and I'll just stop there.,32,,
195,0.97,1469.0,1470.702,.,32,,
196,0.97,1470.702,1499.331,"Yeah, I think the thing that Excites me particularly is the office of housing has been an incredible steward of this resource but they have also been really innovative and we have seen with our funds and rapid act situation just how innovative and how nimble the Department is at Piecing funding together for these complex projects and so I'm really excited about with the renewal what opportunities are afforded.",33,,
197,0.97,1499.331,1508.507,"Yes, thank you for those answers and I saw Damien you had your Mic off mute.",34,,
198,0.97,1508.507,1530.028,Seven parcels have been taken off the private market in the last four years alone by using Tate funds and the American rescue plan dollars you mentioned so I think part of our goal is over the next few months or the next year is to really elevate some of those stories so that these great examples can be shared.,34,,
199,0.97,1530.028,1530.729,"Damien, go ahead.",34,,
200,0.97,1530.729,1535.0,I'm excited for a number of reasons but I'll share one.,35,,
201,0.97,1535.0,1552.984,I sat in on our Seattle building performance and standards open house yesterday and how this came next to the housing levy with equity in the community and other various levels as far as Homeowner ship.,35,,
202,0.97,1552.984,1570.135,Me personally we have gone through low income housing and I've been forced to move outside of Seattle and those things so I understand the complexity of this and how it ties into Sustainability and just so having that opportunity to be part of that is very exciting to me.,35,,
203,0.97,1570.135,1574.739,Coming from a facility stand point as well.,35,,
204,0.97,1574.739,1590.455,"So thinking about the future and reducing carbon Footprints and being carbon neutral and such, as well as creating affordable housing within that so it's a Tandem approach.",35,,
205,0.97,1590.455,1594.826,I'm just fortunate to be here to talk about it.,35,,
206,0.97,1594.826,1596.194,Great.,36,,
207,0.97,1596.194,1596.895,And Denise did you have something?,36,,
208,0.97,1597.228,1602.2,.,36,,
209,0.97,1602.2,1609.774,One of the things I would be most excited to see in future levy is a continued focus on preventing displacement.,37,,
210,0.97,1609.774,1621.486,That was something that we achieved in the last levy including some funding available to help struggling homeowners to stay in their homes.,37,,
211,0.97,1621.486,1645.377,The data we were looking at was really telling about which communities were facing forces of Dus placement and how that was Impacting certain homeowners and I feel like that is a lens that I want to bring even more to make sure that we are continuing to support health around the entire housing Ecosystem.,37,,
212,0.97,1645.377,1656.287,That's one way that I try to look at things is homeowners who lose their homes become Renters which is increasing pressure in the rental market.,37,,
213,0.97,1656.287,1672.671,"There's a whole Ecosystem that happens and the entire Ecosystem of housing in our area is in distress so having a resource like the levy to be able to do the work that's needed, that works for us in our communities based on our needs here is really powerful.",37,,
214,0.97,1672.671,1675.206,So I'm excited to see what we do with the next round.,37,,
215,0.97,1675.54,1680.645,Love that.,38,,
216,0.97,1680.645,1688.72,Both prevent displacement and create additional housing throughout the city.,38,,
217,0.97,1688.72,1689.354,Counsel member Herbold.,38,,
218,0.97,1689.354,1704.736,This line of conversation that we're having now around levy renewal and what we want to see more of perhaps in the renewal.,39,,
219,0.97,1704.736,1734.599,"In the area of preservation and rapid act situation, I am hoping that we could spend some time with the oversight committee also thinking about how the next levy and some of the policies that the counsel has worked with Oh to put in place, how they can work together.",39,,
220,0.97,1734.599,1759.657,"A couple examples, the community preference program for development of housing in areas that have seen a lot of property manager to rent up to people who have represented the characteristics of folks who traditionally lived in the Xhubt and have been pushed out.",39,,
221,0.97,1759.657,1778.276,"Similarly, the city Council has done some work and is hoping to do some more work under the leadership of chair Mosqueda on the intent to sale ordinance.",39,,
222,0.97,1778.276,1779.911,Right of first refusal.,39,,
223,0.97,1779.911,1793.491,So that's a mechanism where tenants can come forward and say we know our building is vulnerable to redevelopment and we would like the city to acquire it so I think we're making changes to that ordinance this year.,39,,
224,0.97,1793.491,1813.111,"But again, to the extent that we can think about how our funding objectives align with some of the policy that we have put in place, I think that is a really good way to insure that policy is able to leverage funds and vice versa.",39,,
225,0.97,1813.111,1815.046,"Just wanted to throw that out there, thank you.",39,,
226,0.97,1815.38,1817.816,.,39,,
227,0.97,1817.816,1820.652,"Great, thank you vice chair.",40,,
228,0.97,1820.652,1822.187,Please go ahead Joel.,40,,
229,0.97,1822.187,1827.392,If I could just address that really quickly.,41,,
230,0.97,1827.392,1856.921,"One project I think this is an area that I would Luke to see the city get behind further is those families that are in areas with owned property for generations and are looking to settle because they're getting older, one project or a couple projects we're looking at and have done one through Oh is to provide the family the ability to Prepurchase the property.",41,,
231,0.97,1856.921,1862.861,There's affordable housing over 100 units of affordable housing remaining on the ground as a commercial tenant.,41,,
232,0.97,1862.861,1871.402,In 85 years they're going to have the opportunity to repurchase the property at a discounted rate.,41,,
233,0.97,1871.402,1887.952,"So that does, it maintains and provides and hopefully provide more affordable housing but then give the opportunity first writer refusal for the family that owned it for generations to purchase it with errors down the future.",41,,
234,0.97,1887.952,1890.655,Thank you all so very much.,42,,
235,0.97,1890.655,1894.659,And I appreciate the initial list of possible policy areas to look into.,42,,
236,0.97,1894.659,1904.302,We'll take one more question and then we're going to go ahead and call the vote.,42,,
237,0.97,1904.302,1906.638,Counsel member Pedersen go ahead.,42,,
238,0.97,1906.638,1919.517,I wanted to echo what Herbold was saying about the policy goals we have in terms of preventing displacement and preserving existing low income housing.,43,,
239,0.97,1919.517,1952.65,And another item is making sure that during this homelessness crisis that we are Prioritizing people experiencing homelessness and making that housing first goal and policy which is proven to work well to help those experiencing homelessness to have the office of housing and the regional homelessness authority working together in our human services Department collaborating more than they already do especially during the crisis of the homelessness.,43,,
240,0.97,1952.65,1955.92,And thank you for your willingness to serve.,43,,

315,0.97,2493.49,2510.241,"So if we're looking at this and serving on the committee, it will allow me to bring my skills of community but also professional skills as well as my passion for this work to advocate as well and work on behalf of my community.",67,,
316,0.97,2510.241,2540.604,Really holds great value to me and I'm excited to know that I'm going to be serving and working with such a broad scope of talented individuals who are also equally passionate about this work and comfortable with a broad range of experiences which I think is what we definitely need in the community and also the fact that we have someone such as E Lan who is front and city center in the community serving on the committee.,67,,
317,0.97,2540.604,2551.115,So I'm excited to move forward in the work and look forward to things that come but also the learning in serving in this capacity.,67,,
318,0.97,2551.115,2551.582,That's incredible.,68,,
319,0.97,2551.582,2559.023,Very excited for you to bring your expertise to the cab and thank you for being here with us.,68,,
320,0.97,2559.023,2569.8,"Jen, would you like to share some of your experience and what drives you to seek Re-Appointment and anything else you would like to share with the committee.",68,,
321,0.97,2569.8,2580.277,"Sure, I have been very lucky to be involved in the sugary sweet beverage and tax.",69,,
322,0.97,2580.277,2609.273,When we worked with the King County coalition and community based organizations at the front and center being got green which Keith Thompson is deeply involved with and it's been a pleasure to watch how the framing of this tax has shifted to a place of increasing food access and services from prenatal to young child arena.,69,,
323,0.97,2609.273,2653.917,I have been on the cab since 2017 and it's been a pleasure to watch as the cab is involved in many ways and we're finally at a full board almost and it is a very diverse board with a lot of incredible talent expertise and perspectives that I am very excited to be helping Co-Chair and also helping to build up new leaders in the cab and move that place of feeling connected to the work broader in what we do.,69,,
324,0.97,2653.917,2695.793,One of the big things I would say that has come out of the last few years on the cab especially as we worked through the health crisis of the pandemic was that our two camps on the cab that we had maybe experienced at some point around food access and early learning have really come together and we have seen this energy between those two priorities and we have found common goals and common objectives and worked really closely to get those out into the community and to see how the different programs we recommend funding for really raise up both goals.,69,,
325,0.97,2695.793,2699.229,So I am thrilled to be part of the cab.,69,,
326,0.97,2699.229,2722.853,"It's one of the favorite things I do and a background there, I also work for the staff Ed program for 14 years which is nutrition education in communities where people are experiencing low income and we work in a variety of places across systems as well as direct education.",69,,
327,0.97,2722.853,2723.454,Thank you very much.,70,,
328,0.97,2723.454,2728.459,Anything else you would like to add before we open it up for comments and questions from the committee?,70,,
329,0.97,2728.459,2729.626,I don't think so.,71,,
330,0.97,2729.626,2759.556,I guess just to say that the community advisory board is working on their annual budget recommendations and those will be transmitted to the Mayor probably in June in the hopes of being able to have meaningful input so the counsel will receive a copy of those recommendations.,71,,
331,0.97,2759.556,2760.324,Thank you.,72,,
332,0.97,2760.324,2765.496,I'll open it up to additional comments and build on what Bridget just said.,72,,
333,0.97,2765.496,2780.11,Myself and the clerk for our committee as well she also our lead on policy issues and she works closely with the cab.,72,,
334,0.97,2780.11,2826.69,. We greatly appreciate the recommendations to make sure the cab revenue being generated from the sugary sweet beverage tax Commission and also what voters committed to and especially during these times when we see stress and trauma in the community recognizing the way the funding from the sugary sweet beverage tax help improve mental health is an incredible opportunity to think about how we emerged from the pandemic in a healthier more Holistic way so I'm thankful for the work you have done and we have been such a ground breaking policy not only in terms of how it's passed but implemented in our city.,72,,
335,0.97,2826.69,2834.097,Folks have called from around the country with interests in how we are done this so you have been the engine that's made it possible.,72,,
336,0.97,2834.097,2838.168,Anything of interest to you Maybe in this time.,72,,
337,0.97,2838.168,2852.816,I shouldn't even say in the wake because we're still in the midst of the pandemic and looking at who has been Disportion Natalie impacted notably folks of color and women of color especially by the economic consequences of Covid.,72,,
338,0.97,2852.816,2867.397,Any other things that you're thinking about putting as a priority topic for you in the cab deliberations to help respond to the crisis that Covid has made worse?,72,,
339,0.97,2867.397,2868.799,I can speak.,73,,
340,0.97,2868.799,2883.947,"One of the things if we're thinking about this work, certainly from an education lens and what we do know is that families and specifically students as we look at our schools and the funding that is deemed to be cut.",73,,
341,0.97,2883.947,2906.003,"So during the pandemic there were extra resources available to families as well as students within schools so school lunch programs were more robust so as the funding looks to be scaled back over the coming months into the next school year, there's great concern to what that's going to look like and also we're heading into the summer.",73,,
342,0.97,2906.003,2914.745,"So what we do know, having access to quality food as well as nutritional foods becomes a concern for many families.",73,,
343,0.97,2914.745,2940.771,I'm hoping we can look at this lens to our work and how we can actually grow that area and how we're looking at schools and how we're funding the programs and how it's going to be able to offer a greater sense of resources that families can look to and specifically when we're talking about schools so that is what I would like to think about as we're looking at this work too in the coming year and also with the budgets.,73,,
344,0.97,2940.771,2943.907,"I love that answer, thank you for bringing that up.",74,,
345,0.97,2943.907,2949.012,And the focus on kids and what they have been through and their health fuzz Cal and mental.,74,,

377,0.97,3073.27,3077.107,We have item number 16 on our agenda here.,90,,
378,0.97,3077.107,3081.011,Madame clerk could you read item 16 into the record?,90,,
379,0.97,3081.011,3086.75,Item number 16 Cannabis business and licensing equity for briefing and discussion.,91,,
380,0.97,3086.75,3086.983,Okay.,92,,
381,0.97,3086.983,3091.321,Folks I'm really excited about the panels that we in front of us today.,92,,
382,0.97,3091.321,3109.606,We're going to break item number 16 into two panels to give us a chance to ask questions midway through and at the end of the panel presentation thanks so much to Aretha from my office working with folks on the line to insure we had a robust discussion.,92,,
383,0.97,3109.606,3118.748,We're excited about these panels and they're able to help us continue our conversation about what Cannabis equity funds and licensing processes look like.,92,,
384,0.97,3118.748,3135.866,"Again, we're looking to have conversations from folks who are in other jurisdictions across the country who have licensing that is really done through an equity lens and also excited to hear from our very own liquor control board team.",92,,
385,0.97,3135.866,3139.402,We have two Presenters talking about what our state currently does.,92,,
386,0.97,3139.402,3148.111,We are going to hear directly from small business owners who were able to enter the Cannabis industry through the equity programs in their jurisdictions.,92,,
387,0.97,3148.111,3164.694,This includes from the Academy of Cannabis science that trains the workers to sell products and businesses and from the States licensing experts who help our business owners be able to open shops so thanks to the liquor control board and members here today.,92,,
388,0.97,3164.694,3206.036,"We also have on our agenda as part of the first panel, Javier root, tray will kin from Academy of Cannabis and we are preventing nor Bert but he let us know this morning they are not going to be able to join us due to a last minute scheduling conflict so we appreciate their interest but we are very excited to have Javier with us today from humble root and again Academy of Cannabis science.",92,,
389,0.97,3206.036,3233.597,I will let them introduce themselves and tell us more about the organizations and we'll take some questions from our members and we'll go into the liquor control board Cannabis board members who will be Garrett a member of the liquor control board Cannabis board and Becky Smith the director of licensing regulation and we'll take questions at the second panel as well but that's a good way to break up the discussion.,92,,
390,0.97,3233.597,3238.235,"Wonderful so good morning, Javier and tray, turning it over to you.",92,,
391,0.97,3238.235,3241.504,Go ahead Trey I see you both off mute.,92,,
392,0.97,3241.504,3248.278,You all can decide who goes first.,92,,
393,0.97,3248.278,3249.713,"Hi, I'll go first.",93,,
394,0.97,3249.713,3255.485,I'm the founder and Ceo of humble root a Cannabis delivery company based in Sacramento.,93,,
395,0.97,3255.485,3265.328,We're a social equity company about 7 years in operation now.,93,,
396,0.97,3265.328,3272.836,My name is tray I'm the founder of Cannabis science founded in 2510.,94,,
397,0.97,3272.836,3280.343,We were the first company approved by the Department of health to train medical Cannabis consultants.,94,,
398,0.97,3280.343,3293.156,We do that in partnership with Seattle central college who has been a brave academic partner and one of the first and I'm here today in support of equity efforts as an advocate for Trans formative education.,94,,
399,0.97,3293.156,3312.809,"We're not taking a particular position on any particular proposal at this point, we are certainly wanting to champion the efforts of equity and as Mr. Burr noted at the top of the meeting, the war on Cannabis has had a tremendous negative effect on individuals and entire communities.",94,,
400,0.97,3312.809,3331.461,We want to be part of that effort Additionally partnered with high line college and with South Seattle college which everyone should know is taking the very bold step of seeking to have the largest education and professional training Footprint in the state.,94,,
401,0.97,3331.461,3348.478,They're currently developing about ten different courses in Cannabis as well as two certificate programs and they continue to roll that out over the year which Aligns with their values as an institution related to social justice and equity.,94,,
402,0.97,3348.478,3363.159,We have also been partnered with last prisoner project and their prison to prosperity program to train constituents release from prison to work Successfulfully in professional jobs in Cannabis.,94,,
403,0.97,3363.159,3391.187,"We partnered with green legacy, a local foundation founded by a former student to help people support empower Underrepresented Cannabis entrepreneurs and founders and we're in conversations with think big an equity organization founded by CJ wells the son of the late Chris Wallace known as big but we're happy to be here today and thank you for the invite and we would like to contribute anything we can to the conversation.",94,,
404,0.97,3391.187,3395.525,"Wonderful, thank you so much.",95,,
405,0.97,3395.525,3396.659,Javier let's start with you.,95,,
406,0.97,3396.659,3433.863,"Some questions we're interested in, if you could share more about humble root and how the core program supported you to be a business owner and what are some of the challenges that you have experienced had you not had the core program and if you want to do a quick reminder for us what core stands for, we have been having these conversations over the last two months and would love to hear more about how the experience has informed your practice and what you from a business owner perspective see what could be done as we think about a similar equity approach in Seattle.",95,,
407,0.97,3433.863,3435.365,Of course.,96,,
408,0.97,3435.365,3439.803,"So humble root is a Nonstore front dispensary, we're delivery only.",96,,
409,0.97,3439.803,3445.475,We're a legacy brand founded in 2015 in the medical market Prelicensing.,96,,
410,0.97,3445.475,3457.887,"The core program is the social equity program in Sacramento which helps people of color, people that grew up in Povrished areas in Sacramento get licensing.",96,,
411,0.97,3457.887,3468.164,One of the main things they did help us with is getting priority licensing and that's one of the most crucial things is getting to the market before the big money comes in.,96,,
412,0.97,3468.164,3473.369,Once their in it's harder to take that.,96,,
413,0.97,3473.369,3479.709,They also provide a licensing workshop as well as some cash grants to our businesses.,96,,
414,0.97,3479.709,3485.849,These cash grants were used for security upgrades and equipment upgrades to help us stay competitive.,96,,
415,0.97,3485.849,3494.257,The challenges that we would have had without core program is probably the long and costly licensing process.,96,,
416,0.97,3494.257,3502.232,Nonequity applicants without priority licensing take six months or so or upwards of construction getting ready to roll.,96,,
417,0.97,3502.232,3506.97,With the social equity program we were able to cut that time in half.,96,,
418,0.97,3506.97,3521.718,"As I said earlier, time is the most important thing here not only because you don't stop paying rent but things keep going and access to the market early is kind of imperative to getting into people's minds.",96,,
419,0.97,3521.718,3527.323,"And if you're not into the market early, you're going to spend money trying to fight for the share leader.",96,,
420,0.97,3527.323,3533.129,To me the ability to get to the market early as well as a little less costly.,96,,
421,0.97,3533.129,3536.399,They give free licensing as well too it's been really helpful for us.,96,,
422,0.97,3536.733,3576.372,Can you talk about the issues around racial equity that served as a barrier to get more business owners of color to be able to enter the Cannabis industry and what opportunities have you found there to be through the core program that has promoted community of color business owners and what would you like to see in terms of additional training maybe for either business owners or for staff?,97,,
423,0.97,3576.372,3586.049,"Yeah, so I think one of the main things that we struggled with Prelicensing too was finding a property that would be properly zoned for Cannabis.",98,,
424,0.97,3586.049,3589.185,We don't come from money or big connections like that.,98,,
425,0.97,3589.185,3597.427,I'm a first generation Hispanic here so I didn't have a lot of connections.,98,,
426,0.97,3597.427,3599.162,Going into the building were difficult.,98,,
427,0.97,3599.162,3607.203,It was more of an issue you couldn't have a building financed by any Bank because the Feds would come in and try to Confiscate that.,98,,
428,0.97,3607.203,3617.447,"Once we were able to get a property, finding the property is difficult not only because it's difficult to find something for money but also the zoning on these properties have been really hard.",98,,
429,0.97,3617.447,3620.45,A lot of them have been taken up.,98,,
430,0.97,3620.45,3632.996,"Once we do find a property, we usually get much higher lease rate than a Noncannabis business and then on top of that, the properties usually require a lot of build out which is quite expensive.",98,,
431,0.97,3632.996,3646.409,And these things are all as a social equity company we're not going to buy a build Sog we're investing into someone else's building upwards of six figures.,98,,
432,0.97,3646.409,3653.016,"The land use, entitlements we get stays with the land not something that we as a social applicant own.",98,,
433,0.97,3653.016,3655.084,So the barrier I see is land.,98,,
434,0.97,3655.084,3664.661,"Even once we get it, we don't own it and we're upgrading the properties for someone that already owns the property and is already wealthy.",98,,
435,0.97,3664.661,3680.076,"So opportunities I would like to see for my staff training, it's called 7 years in so we have developed a good training program Ourself but something that would help other social equity companies are basic Cannabis knowledge as well as medical Cannabis knowledge.",98,,
436,0.97,3680.076,3689.252,A lot of people that want to join the industry have surface level knowledge and that's not ideal typically.,98,,
437,0.97,3689.252,3698.594,You want someone with knowledge on Cannabis is it's imperative because that's what you're using to build core with your customers and solidify that relationship with them.,98,,
438,0.97,3698.594,3701.864,That is something that doesn't exist too much here in California.,98,,
439,0.97,3701.864,3709.405,Oak land has a course but in Sacramento we haven't had anything yet.,98,,
440,0.97,3709.405,3713.309,I'm going to turn it over to tray.,99,,
441,0.97,3713.309,3721.984,"Thanks for being here with the Academy of Cannabis science and I'll notice, while you mentioned not taking a position, that's totally great.",99,,
442,0.97,3721.984,3723.519,We're in information gathering mode.,99,,
443,0.97,3723.519,3749.879,No legislation has been drafted yet so looking forward to hearing more from you about existing training programs are out there for the Cannabis industry in Washington State and a little bit more about what the Academy does and any addition Fwhal information you would like to share from how you're adding opportunities for folks to enter into the industry through an equity lens.,99,,
444,0.97,3749.879,3750.78,Thank you very much.,100,,
445,0.97,3750.78,3754.751,I failed to mention I'm a patient first.,100,,
446,0.97,3754.751,3759.088,So that was also a strong contributing factor for our passion for what we do.,100,,
447,0.97,3759.088,3783.513,"And I was able to witness and be part of the medical Cannabis program that Preexisted 502 and know that the culture and rules and laws changed around all of that and as you might be aware, there's no required training for any Bud tender to work in the state of Washington to work in a retail space.",100,,
448,0.97,3783.513,3786.582,Other States have a baseline requirement.,100,,
449,0.97,3786.582,3840.736,"There is I will say when the patient protection act came on, it created the Cannabis consultant position or medical marijuana consultant position and it's a 20-Hour program that is existing as the highest level of recognized authority and in retail space not only in our state but I don't know if of another program in the country that has a program that's as comprehensive as Washington state so I want to recognize our State for I think going over and above in attempting to fill that gap and make sure that when patients come into a store, that they're greeted by somebody who understands like Javier talked about the importance of medical Cannabis, different qualifying conditions and how Cannabis may benefit without of course veering into acting as a Healthcare professional which they are not.",100,,
450,0.97,3840.736,3846.242,So that does exist but it exists as an opt in part of the program.,100,,
451,0.97,3846.242,3849.745,So stores do Fot have to participate in the medical program.,100,,
452,0.97,3849.745,3861.591,"They opt into that and then they have employees that are trained so if I store Chuss to not opt into the program, it's up to them whether they train anyone or not.",100,,
453,0.97,3861.591,3866.295,I went into a store last week and asked who is in charge of your training?,100,,
454,0.97,3866.295,3873.803,And they kind of looked at me Dumbfounded and they're like what do you mean and I said who trains your staff and they had no answer at all.,100,,
455,0.97,3873.803,3911.407,"So that's sort of all though that might be an exception or minority of licenses, it does exist and when we're talking about handing a controlled substance, we owe it to the public to make sure they know what they're handling and doing everything for first time users to make sure experiences are safe and Dosing protocols are within bounds of reason.",100,,
456,0.97,3911.407,3913.342,So we think education is critical.,100,,
457,0.97,3913.342,3929.525,"All our content since early days has focused on the social injustice of Cannabis and I think likewise, that's important for everybody in the industry to understand what's going on.",100,,
458,0.97,3929.525,3936.232,"The ongoing crime is that over 40,000 people are in jail today serving life sense Tnss.",100,,
459,0.97,3936.232,3967.296,"So that's the ongoing injustice and I know you all are aware of that and that's why you're tackling the issue but we think it's important that everybody working in this space understands context of the space we're working in so that one for empathy and two, SFR understanding and ultimately for the Cannabis industry or the community of Cannabis should be the most diverse community you can belong to.",100,,
460,0.97,3967.296,3971.901,"People of all ages, all backgrounds and the industry itself.",100,,
461,0.97,3971.901,3976.038,People working in the shops and owning businesses should reflect that diversity.,100,,
462,0.97,3976.372,3985.314,Sorry that was long winded.,100,,
463,0.97,3985.314,4004.2,Goes nicely with the comments we heard earlier from other jurisdictions but also from workers on the front line especially folks who are interested in having access to training programs and also maybe small business support themselves.,101,,
464,0.97,4004.2,4027.957,"So I do see a question from our committee member so I think at this point let's flush out some more answers that you can provide for us in response to the committee questions if that sounds okay and of course if there's other items you haven't shared as an overview of the work you do, we would love to hear more of that if you want to integrate that into answers or we will come back to you.",101,,
465,0.97,4027.957,4033.729,"Nelson, would you like to ask that question?",101,,
466,0.97,4033.729,4037.666,Thank you very much.,102,,
467,0.97,4037.666,4047.476,This question is for Trey I did not know about this training program and you said that businesses have to opt in.,102,,
468,0.97,4047.476,4055.117,When they opt in to pay for the training or is it free?,102,,
469,0.97,4055.117,4056.552,That's my first question.,102,,
470,0.97,4056.552,4091.42,"Yes, they opt in and pay employers typically will pay for their employees to go through it but some employees and prospect employees who are professionals in other fields and want to be part of the Cannabis industry in part or full, so we train a lot of people to take their skills and apply them to Cannabis but we give them the language, history and context, understanding of the industry they're going into so they can do that effectively.",103,,
471,0.97,4091.42,4092.955,It is an opt in program.,103,,
472,0.97,4092.955,4095.224,"Just ball Park, how much does it cost?",104,,
473,0.97,4095.224,4100.996,Or is it based on the amount of time or amount of hours of training?,104,,
474,0.97,4100.996,4101.43,Sure.,105,,
475,0.97,4101.43,4105.801,We have a collection of classes.,105,,
476,0.97,4105.801,4112.408,That particular class is between $25 per credit hour so it's $399.,105,,
477,0.97,4112.408,4129.558,"We offer a discount for when people enroll a whole staff or a number of people, but our cost for delivery we have intentionally kept low so all our courses between 20 to $25 per credit hour and it's all Online.",105,,
478,0.97,4129.558,4146.442,That's the nice thing for us being able to welcome people all over.,105,,
479,0.97,4146.442,4153.182,"We have been pleased to attract people from Guam, South Africa, Romania, and India.",105,,
480,0.97,4153.182,4163.359,So the need and hunger is out there.,105,,
481,0.97,4163.359,4169.532,"Like Javier mentioned, it's important for people to understand the industry they're in and the substance they're handing.",105,,
482,0.97,4169.532,4175.437,And we have been excited to see passion from all over.,105,,
483,0.97,4175.437,4177.039,Thank you.,106,,
484,0.97,4177.039,4182.745,And I'm wondering if Maybe the public comment from the morning had an opportunity to go through one of your training.,106,,
485,0.97,4182.745,4191.487,They mentioned the opportunity of doing that and noted the cost that their employer picked up which is great.,106,,
486,0.97,4191.487,4214.777,"I'm wondering as a business owner if this is something that's available and of interest, what are some things you would like to see obviously in a different jurisdiction but if you had a magic wand, what would you like to see as a business owner to make it for possible and affordable for folks to go through training programs like this?",106,,
487,0.97,4214.777,4225.22,So the city of Sacramento put on something similar like a workshop training class for people who want to get in the Cannabis industry on the work force level.,107,,
488,0.97,4225.22,4228.123,This is social equity applicants too.,107,,
489,0.97,4228.123,4232.728,It provided basic Cannabis knowledge and some businesses like sales training.,107,,
490,0.97,4232.728,4238.3,Wasn't too intensive I don't believe they have a built up curriculum.,107,,
491,0.97,4238.3,4243.472,But it's much more early I would say.,107,,
492,0.97,4243.472,4247.476,"And tray, did you have any other thoughts or responses?",108,,
493,0.97,4247.476,4264.059,"No, I would just say that although I'm representing the Academy today, I'm proud to say we're made up of physicians and lawyers, natural paths nurses, veterinarians so we're a firm believer in high intelligence.",109,,
494,0.97,4264.059,4268.631,Never trying to be the smartest person in the room.,109,,
495,0.97,4268.631,4273.769,I'm always learning and you know we remind students this is like getting into a job in Tech.,109,,
496,0.97,4273.769,4278.374,None of us are going to be able to lay down what we know.,109,,
497,0.97,4278.374,4284.113,We need to keep employees constantly up to date because our information is changing all all the time.,109,,
498,0.97,4284.113,4300.262,"A new study comes out about the effectiveness of a certain word of administration for a qualifying condition comes out, it's important people know as well as studies that might come out to talk about particular harm and how we can avoid those.",109,,
499,0.97,4300.596,4306.001,.,109,,
500,0.97,4306.001,4306.335,Excellent.,110,,
501,0.97,4306.335,4308.971,"Yes counsel member Nelson, go ahead one more question.",110,,
502,0.97,4308.971,4313.275,I might have missed it in your presentation but how is core paid for?,110,,
503,0.97,4313.275,4321.417,I think we had a presenter from Sacramento in a previous meeting but I don't know if there was a 5% tax or something.,110,,
504,0.97,4321.417,4325.654,Can't remember so what is the funding source for your program?,110,,
505,0.97,4325.654,4336.932,So the state has given grants to individual cities and counties and then those cities and counties create their own social equity programs and administer the money how they see fit.,111,,
506,0.97,4336.932,4337.199,Thank you.,112,,
507,0.97,4337.533,4339.368,.,112,,
508,0.97,4339.368,4339.702,Thank you.,113,,
509,0.97,4339.702,4354.783,One last question and then we look forward to hearing from the liquor control board representatives and staff about how they're working to encourage equity through their licensing and training approach as well.,113,,
510,0.97,4354.783,4383.078,"If I could ask Javier and Trey, as we're thinking about equity in the context of Seattle and recognizing we're the first State to move forward with Legalization, what I'm hearing throughout the last two years is while we were the first state on Legalization, we're behind in terms of where other jurisdictions are in terms of how we have added equity into the application of public policy.",113,,
511,0.97,4383.078,4396.892,"If at least the local level so as we think about how we could now fold back in equity approach in dollars, support and you mentioned property.",113,,
512,0.97,4396.892,4403.699,Acquiring property with the zoning changes and the ability to work and have access to Capitol.,113,,
513,0.97,4403.699,4414.71,"One thing where you're like as you're building this, this is the most helpful thing to see, any indication of what that might be?",113,,
514,0.97,4414.71,4427.689,"Well, like you I said you were first to implement the recreational market so it might be a little backwards but to me it was matched to the market.",114,,
515,0.97,4427.689,4434.43,I can't say enough how much I wouldn't be here today if I didn't have the priority licensing.,114,,
516,0.97,4434.43,4439.234,As big companies come in they eat up the market share and it's hard to take that back.,114,,
517,0.97,4439.234,4444.006,Given this opportunity to get in there first was really impair Tiff.,114,,
518,0.97,4444.006,4447.509,"Like I said, it's the only reason why I'm here.",114,,
519,0.97,4447.509,4450.746,We wouldn't be able to compete if we came in late.,114,,
520,0.97,4450.746,4453.782,One thing some cities are looking at is reducing the city tax.,114,,
521,0.97,4453.782,4463.392,This is one of the biggest challenges we do face in California we're taxed effectively over 50% which makes it impossible to have a successful business.,114,,
522,0.97,4463.392,4474.87,"The way that breaks down, we have a 28% state tax of 4% city tax, 1% neighborhood tax and 8% sales tax.",114,,
523,0.97,4474.87,4478.841,21% Federal tax subject to 280E and those are taken off gross.,114,,
524,0.97,4478.841,4482.01,They don't care how we start our money.,114,,
525,0.97,4482.01,4491.253,"So some cities around here, I know San Francisco implemented a two year moratorium on the city tax.",114,,
526,0.97,4491.253,4504.132,That's beneficial to what Sacramento is doing something for the social equity applicants and put a moratorium on that city tax to be more competitive.,114,,
527,0.97,4504.132,4507.102,That's one Thng I could see being beneficial.,114,,
528,0.97,4507.102,4523.285,As a social equity company usually you have the same scale of economy as the a large business so that tax moratorium will be helpful to keep us competitive with the bigger players.,114,,
529,0.97,4523.285,4531.093,Okay Trey and then Council member Herbold.,115,,
530,0.97,4531.093,4535.53,"Yes, someone mention earlier Testifying about Exspongsment.",116,,
531,0.97,4535.53,4550.412,"Anything we can do to understand processes involve lawyers and fees and processes that can be complicated so for anybody who is not a lawyer, anything we can do to lower the bar there because people's criminal history certainly follow them.",116,,
532,0.97,4550.412,4577.072,"I think it's important to look at our Underage community because if we continue to view Cannabis as a criminal activity and involve them in juvenile justice systems rather than fines and other deterrence efforts, we can do them a disservice and don't want to put anybody into prison pipeline that doesn't belong there.",116,,
533,0.97,4577.072,4588.784,Access to Capitol is huge because you are able to carry the license and own your possession.,116,,
534,0.97,4588.784,4593.889,I want to hold up the muck L shoot tribe as a great example.,116,,
535,0.97,4593.889,4600.796,Our tribal model in the state is exceptional.,116,,
536,0.97,4600.796,4606.902,I love the fact a community gets a license so everybody is lifted up and everybody can benefit.,116,,
537,0.97,4606.902,4638.233,"The muck L shoot tribal college teamed up with joint rivers when they were about to have their first Cannabis store on their land and they did a series we worked with them, a series of six weeks educational event so once a week we would go and train people about what Cannabis was, the history, possible benefits so that the whole community could learn and from those community gathering, they were effective able to choose staff.",116,,
538,0.97,4638.233,4647.042,People started with a head start in training and then the community also had an opportunity to buy in and Express concerns and fears.,116,,
539,0.97,4647.042,4656.818,"So as a model, I haven't seen anything work as well and be such a fun engaging enlightening event as what they did.",116,,
540,0.97,4656.818,4664.292,So I wanted to give a shout out to the muck L shoot tribe for approaching this in a different way and leading first with education.,116,,
541,0.97,4664.292,4664.493,Thank you.,116,,
542,0.97,4664.826,4668.997,.,116,,
543,0.97,4668.997,4672.1,Thank you very much.,117,,
544,0.97,4672.1,4674.503,"Herbold, go ahead.",117,,
545,0.97,4674.503,4675.07,Thank you.,118,,
546,0.97,4675.07,4675.437,A couple things.,118,,
547,0.97,4675.437,4691.253,I have mentioned in one of these presentations this task but it's appropriate given some of the comments of the panelists to bring it up again.,118,,
548,0.97,4691.253,4695.49,The EK size tax on Cannabis is 37% in Washington state.,118,,
549,0.97,4695.49,4711.073,Also I want to flag that counsel in the past has showed an interest in reducing the licensing fee that Cannabis businesses pay.,118,,
550,0.97,4711.073,4721.416,Fas has recognized some improvements in the licensing fee that would result in greater equity.,118,,
551,0.97,4721.416,4731.827,"In last year's Prebudget process, we had actually made a proposal to reduce the business license fee on Cannabis business.",118,,
552,0.97,4731.827,4741.903,Did make a proposal to the Mayor's office but they did not put forward to the counsel.,118,,
553,0.97,4741.903,4758.253,And the counsel couldn't independently act on it if we had some understanding of the details of the proposal but that was not possible at that time so just want to flag that FAS does have a proposal for a reduced business license fee.,118,,
554,0.97,4758.253,4769.731,That we could take a look at and assuming that they get the support to share that with us from the executive.,118,,
555,0.97,4769.731,4775.003,Also just a couple real quick questions.,118,,
556,0.97,4775.003,4781.309,"And if you covered this, I apologize for asking again.",118,,
557,0.97,4781.309,4807.402,"Related to the social equity licensing available in Seattle, I think there are only ten or I'm sorry two that are issued in Seattle and I understand that is set by the state but can you talk a little bit about the status of issuing those two licenses in Seattle?",118,,
558,0.97,4807.402,4825.52,"And then Secondly, would also love to understand about--from I think LCB also, what barriers exist currently in licensing for folks who have a criminal history on their background.",118,,
559,0.97,4825.854,4840.302,I'm happy to use that as a good transition from folks to LCB.,118,,
560,0.97,4840.302,4847.542,That's a great transition actually to this second panel.,118,,
561,0.97,4847.542,4851.046,My apologies.,119,,
562,0.97,4851.046,4863.625,"You had great questions and again, I want to thank Javier and Trey if you have to leave, thank you for being here with us this morning and if Yaur able to stay fantastic and maybe more questions later.",120,,
563,0.97,4863.625,4877.205,Today with us on the second part of the panel we have Ali Garrett with the Washington state liquor control and Cannabis board member and Becky Smith director of licensing and regulation at the Washington liquor and Cannabis board.,120,,
564,0.97,4877.205,4879.241,Thank you for being here with us today.,120,,
565,0.97,4879.241,4887.949,I will not add my questions because the ones that Herbold are perfectly timed to roll over to your presentation.,120,,
566,0.97,4887.949,4894.489,Thank you for being with us and I see you off mute.,120,,
567,0.97,4894.489,4897.859,I'll let you take it away.,120,,
568,0.97,4897.859,4898.326,Thank you.,121,,
569,0.97,4898.326,4900.795,I see we're running close to out of time.,121,,
570,0.97,4900.795,4908.904,I know we both have other meetings to jump on shortly.,121,,
571,0.97,4908.904,4917.479,But as I am a liquor Cannabis board member and have been on the board since August 2016.,121,,
572,0.97,4917.479,4931.86,"Being the first state Legalizing recreational Cannabis, the LCB didn't know what they didn't know and one of the things we didn't have in place was an equity program.",121,,
573,0.97,4931.86,4947.042,In February of 2020 the liquor Cannabis board introduced House bill 2070 called the social equity bill and that bill passed in February of 2020.,121,,
574,0.97,4947.042,4957.185,"As a result of that bill, a social equity task force was formed and the first meeting was in late October of 2020.",121,,
575,0.97,4957.185,4963.892,The LCB in the meantime did what a virtual community meeting throughout the state.,121,,
576,0.97,4963.892,5002.664,We had three meetings to hear from the community and learn from the community their challenges of getting in what they thought worked and what didn't work and just to hear firsthand from the community how not having a social equity program impacted the mostly African American community but the minority community at large and also to just hear the issues and concerns they had throughout the licensing process and that kicked off the first social equity task force meeting later in October of 2020.,121,,
577,0.97,5002.664,5010.739,"And from there, Becky is going to now show you and do a presentation on where we currently are.",121,,
578,0.97,5010.739,5011.139,And going.,121,,
579,0.97,5011.139,5021.149,"Fantastic, thank you Ali and we have extra time if you have another pressing meeting, I apologize for that but we have plenty of time now.",122,,
580,0.97,5021.149,5028.69,We'll go until 11:30 and we have two other items to get to but want to make sure you didn't feel pressed for time.,122,,
581,0.97,5028.69,5031.292,Welcome Becky thanks for being here with us.,122,,
582,0.97,5031.626,5037.198,.,122,,
583,0.97,5037.198,5043.004,"Thank you, I was hoping someone would have my slide show.",123,,
584,0.97,5043.004,5043.271,Thank you.,124,,
585,0.97,5043.605,5053.581,.,124,,
586,0.97,5055.717,5061.523,We do have the presentation linked as well on today's agenda so if you would like to start.,125,,
587,0.97,5061.523,5062.824,Okay let me start then.,126,,
588,0.97,5062.824,5071.399,I'm going to kick it off with the two questions so I will be addressing those.,126,,
589,0.97,5071.399,5072.333,It's pretty short slide show.,126,,
590,0.97,5072.333,5081.142,I wanted to explain that we currently are not accepting applications for producer process retailing.,126,,
591,0.97,5081.142,5088.016,You can buy a business but you can't currently apply for a business.,126,,
592,0.97,5088.016,5104.432,We are looking at however with the new social equity program and the purpose of that program is to increase the number of Cannabis retail licenses held by a social equity applicant.,126,,
593,0.97,5104.432,5122.584,Part of that is being able to make sure that the applicants that are Disportion Atly areas and harm suffered by families in local areas Sunlt to severe impacts on the war on drugs.,126,,
594,0.97,5122.584,5134.796,"All I mentioned about the law, it does authorize liquor and Cannabis board to Reshoe retail licenses that have been forfeited, revoked or canceled.",126,,
595,0.97,5134.796,5139.1,Also they do not have the authority to increase the number of retail licenses for the program.,126,,
596,0.97,5139.1,5148.209,This must be done by the Legislature and that we currently have 40 licenses available and I believe that somebody said we had two in the city of Seattle.,126,,
597,0.97,5148.209,5161.489,But what I want you to know is that the agency has begun drafting rules to allow more flexibility for social equity applicants to find locations within the county instead of specific cities.,126,,
598,0.97,5161.489,5181.242,"So we have the authority to move it from the city level to County level and that will bring on an extra 8 licenses available in King County so for instance, those 8 folks could if there was room available in the city of Seattle be located in the city of Seattle.",126,,
599,0.97,5181.576,5190.818,The task force also created to provide LCB with recommendations on how to implement the program.,126,,
600,0.97,5190.818,5198.66,The recommendations we Ceoed from the task force were received in January of this past year.,126,,
601,0.97,5198.66,5200.261,That rule making is currently underway.,126,,
602,0.97,5200.261,5213.908,We had our first listen and learn which invited community members to have input on our rules and to understand what it is that we're moving forward with.,126,,
603,0.97,5213.908,5220.949,We have accepted all the task force recommendations with the exception of the scoring rubric.,126,,
604,0.97,5220.949,5239.968,"The LCB has proposed a race neutral alternative to scoring rubric and that as many of you know, the Federal equal protection clause prohibits the LCB from using explicit racial preference in licensing.",126,,
605,0.97,5239.968,5247.308,So our agency has also taken the other recommendations with that exception and we also listened to feedback.,126,,
606,0.97,5247.308,5258.62,We heard from task force that my staff and myself attended all the task force meetings that we wanted to hear from the community as well about what we could be doing differently.,126,,
607,0.97,5258.62,5267.495,We Hld a couple forums about two years ago and with that information what we did was create a Website.,126,,
608,0.97,5267.495,5276.771,We have a Website where folks can go to look at information or look up information on the social equity program.,126,,
609,0.97,5276.771,5279.14,We also made changes in criminal history.,126,,
610,0.97,5279.14,5285.747,So we made changes to the rules and I'm going to say can you move that to the next slide please?,126,,
611,0.97,5286.08,5294.856,So criminal history roles.,126,,
612,0.97,5294.856,5304.365,The goal was to reduce Unintentional barriers to enter into the legal Cannabis market.,126,,
613,0.97,5304.365,5330.658,"That although we had allowed for folks with criminal history into and to be able to apply for a license, what we didn't do is that we didn't explain all of the background around applying for the criminal history so folks might have unintentionally took themselves out of applying for a license in the very beginning.",126,,
614,0.97,5330.658,5340.301,That now with those changes I would say that we have eased conviction allowances and time considered.,126,,
615,0.97,5340.301,5342.203,We're removing the point system.,126,,
616,0.97,5342.203,5346.641,We removed the requirements for an individual to disclose past offenses.,126,,
617,0.97,5346.641,5365.927,"Since we run a check Anyways on the criminal history and we run fingerprints, it's easier for us to see what's in the background without having to do a got you, that I think that folks felt like might disclose everything I could remember but in Cannabis, it is a bit different than liquor.",126,,
618,0.97,5365.927,5368.429,We go all the way back to juvenile.,126,,
619,0.97,5368.429,5375.737,All that history they have to be able to remember and complete the documents so we removed that requirement.,126,,
620,0.97,5375.737,5380.575,And we'll be able to check the criminal history ourselves.,126,,
621,0.97,5380.575,5395.056,We also wanted to make sure that we considered transparency in how the process worked.,126,,
622,0.97,5395.056,5401.763,"The internal review that happens after somebody fills out their criminal history, that folks didn't really know about that.",126,,
623,0.97,5401.763,5421.916,They didn't understand that they could write letters or explain why it was that or how much they changed or they haven't had any violations or any arrests in the last ten years.,126,,
624,0.97,5421.916,5430.591,So instead of just assuming folks knew we wanted to make sure we're transparent so that's included in the rule set as well.,126,,
625,0.97,5430.591,5448.009,"Then just to note that the licensing division over the last 8 years that we reviewed 16 thousand 500 criminal history records and out of those, 43 were denied licenses because of their criminal history.",126,,
626,0.97,5448.009,5452.18,"And again, those rules went into effect last October of 2021.",126,,
627,0.97,5452.18,5452.547,"Next slide, please.",126,,
628,0.97,5452.88,5463.758,I also wanted to show you our Cannabis retail owned store by people of color.,127,,
629,0.97,5463.758,5472.667,So this data represents Self-Identified race of a majority of equal interest owner who disclosed their race in August of 2021.,127,,
630,0.97,5472.667,5473.267,We review this yearly.,127,,
631,0.97,5473.267,5482.844,"We have to look at the criminal history, it's not a question of course that we ask that any forms other than the criminal history it is voluntary.",127,,
632,0.97,5482.844,5492.22,You do not have to disclose your Ethnicity on that form.,127,,
633,0.97,5492.22,5492.653,"Again, or your race.",127,,
634,0.97,5492.653,5493.12,It's Self-Identified.,127,,
635,0.97,5493.12,5493.354,Next slide.,127,,
636,0.97,5493.688,5499.76,This is our producer Processer.,127,,
637,0.97,5499.76,5507.435,The data represents the Self-Identified race and majority or equal interests of owners that produce.,127,,
638,0.97,5507.435,5520.648,"So just so you're aware, we currently have only two stores in the city of Seattle that have majority owner by people of color.",127,,
639,0.97,5520.648,5521.249,Next slide.,127,,
640,0.97,5521.249,5533.861,"In response to addressing comments made by the community at social equity and Cannabis task force meeting, the agency created a social equity page.",127,,
641,0.97,5533.861,5552.046,An external Website with various opportunities for further engagement with the community that you can go on our Website and look at the social equity program and it will give you Aboverview and also there's licensing resources so you know what's a business structure and what makes up the business structure.,127,,
642,0.97,5552.046,5552.48,Local requirements.,127,,
643,0.97,5552.48,5565.86,"That was a big one as we licensed folks, what we heard from our first initial and second initial licensing both retailers and producer Processers is that what was a local requirement.",127,,
644,0.97,5565.86,5576.671,"And it's difficult to find on depending on your Website at the city, sometimes it can be difficult for those licenses to be able to find or those applicants.",127,,
645,0.97,5576.671,5577.905,We also included local restrictions.,127,,
646,0.97,5577.905,5601.095,"So LCB and the state has restrictions and Bufferers but then the city can either--and the city of Seattle has lowered the buffer zones to 500 but they also have zones that don't allow businesses to be within 1,000 feet of another business so as we lower our Bufferers, there's other changes that the city can make as far as requirements.",127,,
647,0.97,5601.095,5604.599,So we have that on our Website as well.,127,,
648,0.97,5604.599,5608.569,We also have a floor plan so what is a floor plan look like?,127,,
649,0.97,5608.569,5619.981,We want to make sure that any information we can provide social equity applicant ahead of time that they're able to prepare for the application process.,127,,
650,0.97,5619.981,5635.062,"And then we have a place that you can ask questions so if you have a question or suggestion, my staff monitors that and we will respond within 24 hours of receiving a question.",127,,
651,0.97,5635.062,5642.003,We also have information there about our rules.,127,,
652,0.97,5642.003,5645.573,We keep other agency partners providing information on the Website as well.,127,,
653,0.97,5645.906,5648.542,So that's the end of my slide.,127,,
654,0.97,5648.542,5666.627,"I do want to mention a couple other things that as I mentioned we were just beginning our role process and as far as how social equity application will flow, that the idea is that we'll start like we do with any other type of license.",127,,
655,0.97,5666.627,5673.601,It will go through business licensing services and we'll open the window in the fall of this year.,127,,
656,0.97,5673.601,5677.438,We're hoping for September of 2022 to open the window application.,127,,
657,0.97,5677.438,5681.709,It will be open for 30 days.,127,,
658,0.97,5681.709,5699.994,"So LCB will receive those applications after the 30-day window closes and then we'll send those applications over to--when I say the application, it's a social equity application only--and they will be sent to a third party contractor.",127,,
659,0.97,5699.994,5712.773,We're just getting ready to release an Rfp for a third party contractor that will then review and score the social equity applications.,127,,
660,0.97,5712.773,5720.915,"Once they have been scored, they will receive all the applications back again and the highest scoring applications will be processed.",127,,
661,0.97,5720.915,5727.021,We know that with the small amount 40 licenses is such a small amount.,127,,
662,0.97,5727.021,5741.068,We know that there is going to be quite a few folks that apply for those licenses so we'll have a double blind lottery that will be able to determine who is processed and in what order.,127,,
663,0.97,5741.068,5757.852,Those folks will receive a preliminary letter of approval which will help them to be able to work with the cities and it will also help them work with the Department of Commerce to look into what kind of funding might be eligible for.,127,,
664,0.97,5757.852,5778.706,"And then at that point, it will also at the same time we'll be processing those applications through the LCB because those folks even though you meet the requirement to be a social applicant you still have to meet the state requirement to become licensed.",127,,
665,0.97,5778.706,5792.62,"We released a brand new position, one of the task force recommendations was to hire a program manager to sort of be that for an applicant to help them through the licensing process.",127,,
666,0.97,5792.62,5800.628,That position has just been posted and I will say that you do not have to live in Olympia to apply for that position.,127,,
667,0.97,5800.628,5820.08,"So if you know of anybody who just begun accepting applications, we are planning on after the rules are accepted we are planning on this summer to go in and do education with the folks with interest in applying for social equity applications.",127,,
668,0.97,5820.08,5823.184,As well so I'm going to stop there and see if you have questions.,127,,
669,0.97,5823.517,5830.057,.,127,,
670,0.97,5830.057,5834.995,Thank you Ali did you want to add anything else?,128,,
671,0.97,5834.995,5835.196,No.,129,,
672,0.97,5835.196,5842.803,Okay excellent thank you to both of you.,130,,
673,0.97,5842.803,5846.407,Did you have follow up questions on those two?,130,,
674,0.97,5846.407,5886.78,"I want to confirm my understanding based on what I have heard about sort of the new flexibility as it relates to the geographic distribution of equity licenses so after all is said and done, given that now the situation is that King County has 8 and that includes two that were originally targeted for Seattle, it is possible particularly in our market and our real estate market and land use configuration, it's possible that Seattle will not end up with any after the process is all through and done.",131,,
675,0.97,5886.78,5902.963,"That's not a criticism, just a reality of some of the restrictions inherent in our zoning as well as the high cost of real estate.",131,,
676,0.97,5902.963,5906.734,Just want to confirm that is a possible outcome.,131,,
677,0.97,5906.734,5907.635,You're absolutely correct.,132,,
678,0.97,5907.635,5908.903,That is a possible outcome.,132,,
679,0.97,5908.903,5909.169,Thank you.,133,,
680,0.97,5909.503,5911.005,.,133,,
681,0.97,5911.005,5921.815,I also want to mention in our rules and task force recommendation was that an applicant doesn't have to a time limit.,134,,
682,0.97,5921.815,5929.356,So they could take a year or two years.,134,,
683,0.97,5929.356,5929.923,In order to find a location.,134,,
684,0.97,5929.923,5934.762,Any additional follow up?,135,,
685,0.97,5934.762,5942.403,"Great, thank you for your answers and Ali I see you off mute, did you have anything to add?",135,,
686,0.97,5942.403,5943.437,Nope.,136,,
687,0.97,5943.437,5948.142,"Counsel member Nelson, please go ahead.",137,,
688,0.97,5948.142,5953.447,Thank you Madame chair.,138,,
689,0.97,5953.447,5964.792,So the proponent of this proposal has been talking to our offices and they're proposing a tax on product that will generate $5 million a year.,138,,
690,0.97,5964.792,5976.036,"There are 55 shops right now in Seattle so that comes down to about 92 to $110,000 per shop.",138,,
691,0.97,5976.036,5993.887,"And obviously the bigger ones would pay more and the smaller ones would pay less but the smaller ones have less cushion to absorb that on top of already paying as Council member Herbold noted 37% excise tax, highest in the nation.",138,,
692,0.97,5993.887,6000.794,"A $6,000 FAS licensing fee on top of 10.25% sales tax, etc.",138,,
693,0.97,6000.794,6013.474,So total it ends up being I'm told by members of the Cannabis collective that's about 47% of revenue.,138,,
694,0.97,6013.474,6018.479,"So Ms. Garrett, I'm directing my question to you.",138,,
695,0.97,6018.479,6047.975,"You have a better sense of in your role at the LCB, what kinds of barriers and costs marijuana shops face across the state but you're also president of tape 100 and a small business owner yourself so I would just like to know what your opinion is of this additional tax on these small businesses.",138,,
696,0.97,6047.975,6051.412,.,139,,
697,0.97,6051.412,6054.782,Thank you.,140,,
698,0.97,6054.782,6056.316,I'll just quickly reiterate.,140,,
699,0.97,6056.316,6080.741,This is a proposal we are considering in partnership so I want to make sure I clarify for the record there's a broad coalition of folks interested and there's no proposal on the table yet as terms of the counsel and Mayor's position and policy.,140,,
700,0.97,6080.741,6108.302,"We get proposals from various stake holders so I want to make sure I'm super clear that even in the last two months we have clarified a number of times that there's not a proposal we are continuing to in look at, there's not a draft law that has been suggested by counsel member Nelson so I wanted to make sure that's clear and we Harken to the public comments from the Naacp.",140,,
701,0.97,6108.302,6116.043,"Apologies, I jumped in because you were looking for the mute button and wanted to fill the air so I did so.",140,,
702,0.97,6116.043,6152.246,"Okay so I am going to answer the question not on behalf of the LCB capacity but as president of Tay boar 100 that does advocacy work the women and small business owners, and being a small business owner myself, anything that increases costs to a small business and I would say in this industry, the majority 100% of the businesses are considered small businesses.",141,,
703,0.97,6152.246,6176.737,So anything that increases tax on a small business propose as I harm that in some cases in some of these businesses revenue projection is very Marginable anyway so that's my answer.,141,,
704,0.97,6176.737,6180.307,I appreciate you being here.,142,,
705,0.97,6180.307,6181.041,Any additional comments or questions?,142,,
706,0.97,6181.375,6196.657,Okay I'm really interested in following up Ali I Meeth be reaching out for additional time and would love to chat more with you and Becky would love to know more about--let me ask this real question.,142,,
707,0.97,6196.657,6211.471,"If race is not being looked at in the application of the equity licensing, and that's the only sounds like recommendation that wasn't taken, is geographic location looked at?",142,,
708,0.97,6211.471,6233.727,"For example, we're interested in defining folks who have been Disportion Natalie harmed by the war on drugs, especially noting the impact on folks who have lived in the central district and the impact that the war on drugs has had for communities.",142,,
709,0.97,6233.727,6244.238,So we're looking at geographic location and whether it's being looked at in lieu of the recommendation of race and Ethnicity.,142,,
710,0.97,6244.238,6250.377,"I'm going to say, Becky, you might because I don't think it's that many.",143,,
711,0.97,6250.377,6255.215,You might want to cover the Requireents.,143,,
712,0.97,6255.215,6281.141,"There's four or five where we zoned in on and one of the comments we were hearing is you know, with gentry fy occasion and moving out of the central district, we are H to be conscious we did talk about what Becky was going to answer and we were taking those things into consideration.",143,,
713,0.97,6281.141,6289.082,So there's actually nine areas that we're going to be looking at and scoring for.,144,,
714,0.97,6289.082,6298.792,And that's have you lived in a DIA area and we're working with the University of Washington to provide us with that information.,144,,
715,0.97,6298.792,6300.494,We'll have a map that shows that information.,144,,
716,0.97,6300.494,6307.467,"How long have you lived in the DIA area so six months to five years, 10 points.",144,,
717,0.97,6307.467,6310.704,"Five years to ten years, 20 points.",144,,
718,0.97,6310.704,6313.94,Ten years plus 40 points and convicted of a drug offense.,144,,
719,0.97,6313.94,6321.448,That's Whoever it is that's the majority owner.,144,,
720,0.97,6321.448,6322.416,Convicted of a Cannabis offense.,144,,
721,0.97,6322.416,6337.664,"That if a family member was convicted of an offense and then convicted of an offense against family members and if you were convicted of a Cannabis offense, what type of offense was it and what type of sentence did you receive.",144,,
722,0.97,6337.664,6356.817,"As we looked at different States that was one of the recommendations that they had and used in their scoring so again, if you were a person of color you tended to serve prison time verses receiving a fine.",144,,
723,0.97,6356.817,6359.953,So a fine gets five points.,144,,
724,0.97,6359.953,6362.322,Served time in prison gets 40 points.,144,,
725,0.97,6362.322,6366.827,Did you or your family member have Incarceration keep you from getting employment?,144,,
726,0.97,6366.827,6374.101,Did you lose your home or ability to purchase a home or rent a home as a result of your conviction?,144,,

730,0.97,6426.586,6434.694,Not something that any of the other licensing have been required to do but something required by law.,144,,

745,0.97,6532.926,6539.833,We did hear from central staff that if we didn't have time for item number 18 there's nothing urgent about that.,148,,
746,0.97,6539.833,6554.014,We will endeavor to put that on the agenda for the next committee meeting and this is a great opportunity for us to see thumbs up.,148,,

756,0.97,6622.849,6645.972,At the committee's March 16th meeting I walked through the 18 projects the executive proposed for inclusion on the 2022 list which is the same as the 2021 list with the exception of proposed removal of the Seattle Department of Transportations North gate bridge and cycle track project and the reason for the removal is that's because it's now open to pedestrian traffic.,149,,
757,0.97,6645.972,6653.046,So resolution 32047 which wasn't introduced in time for the prior meeting discussion but is before you today.,149,,
758,0.97,6653.046,6657.55,It includes the 18 executive proposed projects at this time.,149,,
759,0.97,6657.55,6671.931,There are three proposed amendments for the list that the counsel members informed staff of by the March 22nd deadline and I'm happy to walk through those now or if you want to handle them one at a time when moved for consideration.,149,,

763,0.97,6677.237,6686.78,So the first amendment is sponsored by counsel member Herbold and would Spu drainage partnership South Park project to the wash list.,151,,
764,0.97,6686.78,6694.888,It's $10 million and related to the Seattle public utilities South Park storm water program proposed to continue on the watch list.,151,,
765,0.97,6694.888,6711.538,The SP program is a suites of projects intended to reduce flooding in the South Park neighborhood and the project would allow S-Dot to partner with Spu on installing drainage collection systems and repairing deteriorated roads.,151,,
766,0.97,6711.538,6721.514,The second amendment would add the Finance and administrative services human Capitol management system to the list.,151,,
767,0.97,6721.514,6739.432,It's estimated cost $61 million Sxin and intended to replace the source system and then the final amendment authored by Council member Morales and it would add route 7 corridor project to the watch list.,151,,
768,0.97,6739.432,6761.454,"It has an estimated cost of $8.5 million and expected to be constructed in 2022 and it would make improvements to sidewalks, crossings, signals and install Aba curb ramps along the route 7 bus line which runs along Rainier Avenue and it's Proximately South Bay street in the South up to Deer born street in the North.",151,,
769,0.97,6761.454,6768.027,And that concludes my summary of the amendments and chair I could also bring them up on the screen if that's helpful for counsel members.,151,,

780,0.97,6819.345,6846.172,There's a related project in S-Dot called the Spu drainage partnership South Park so what this amendment does is adds the related project to the 2022 watch list with the understanding that there are two components of the project.,155,,
781,0.97,6846.172,6861.287,"Thespu project would install a pump station to control flooding in South park and the S-Dot CIP capital improvement program notes that ""alone this project will not control flooding.",155,,
782,0.97,6861.287,6877.704,"Many streets in the area are in poor condition, don't have a street drainage collection system and this funding allows Spu and S-Dot to partner to install the needed collection systems and repair the deteriorated costs . "".",155,,

840,0.97,7215.741,7224.183,I have a question that I probably should have asked at a previous briefing.,188,,
841,0.97,7224.183,7253.646,"In past years when the watch list has come before us, I have advocated and for many years sounded like the budget office was Amendable to do this and it hasn't happened and maybe something changed but I have advocated that the budget office consider not just individual projects capital projects but also program Mattic projects is anything different this year?",188,,
842,0.97,7253.646,7259.118,So counsel member nothing is different this year from 2021.,189,,
843,0.97,7259.118,7261.954,In 2021 the CBO did work on a new format.,189,,
844,0.97,7261.954,7270.496,There's only one project in the watch list right now and that's the city light project related to pole replacements.,189,,
845,0.97,7270.496,7275.334,So that is a new format but consistent with 2021.,189,,
846,0.97,7275.334,7279.438,Got it.,190,,
847,0.97,7279.438,7283.776,Okay so maybe Yeah I'm forgetting that change was made then.,190,,
848,0.97,7283.776,7316.409,"So really appreciate that and could you just real quickly speak to one of the things that CBO was talking about, the difficulty of doing a program inclusion on the watch list is the fact that there would be a different approach to tracking performance and can you say a couple sentences about how they address Sthoz concerns and how is the form different?",190,,
849,0.97,7316.409,7318.544,I would have to take a look.,191,,
850,0.97,7318.544,7321.647,"Sorry, I don't have the detail in front of me.",191,,
851,0.97,7321.647,7338.097,"One of the fundamental differences there's no project baseline so as you know when we get to 30% design phase, that's what we track future progress against so an ongoing project there are estimates about what the program will spend over time.",191,,
852,0.97,7338.097,7341.967,That's one of the main challenges is reporting the financial data.,191,,
853,0.97,7341.967,7355.414,The report for the city light is less a few graphs are different but I could follow up with more information.,191,,
854,0.97,7355.414,7374.133,Not seeing additional hands for questions so I want to thank the Mayor's office who has been working with us as we consider possible amendments.,191,,
855,0.97,7374.467,7393.919,So look forward to continuing to work with them and all of you as we look at all the items including the amendments added today on the watch list.,191,,
856,0.97,7393.919,7394.653,Thanks for your work.,191,,
857,0.97,7394.653,7399.759,Call the roll on the passage of the resolution 32047 as amended.,191,,
858,0.97,7400.092,7433.392,The regulations Lugs amended pass will be sent to the April 12th meeting for a final vote.,191,,
859,0.97,7433.392,7449.975,"As I mentioned central staff was suggesting that if we didn't have time it's okay to hold item number 18 so if there's no objection, resolution 32049 agenda item number 18 will be postponed and held until April 20th.",191,,
860,0.97,7449.975,7456.916,No objection the resolution is postponed and we will consider that at the April 20th meeting.,191,,
861,0.97,7456.916,7459.251,Look forward to the next committee meeting with you all.,191,,
862,0.97,7459.251,7464.223,"If you haven't heard me make the plug, tune in on Friday for the revenue forecast.",191,,
863,0.97,7464.223,7482.842,The counsel will have its first opportunity to receive the recommended forecast and it will be published and broadcast live on Seattle channel and colleagues you all have the chance to ask questions or hear the outcome of the counsel deliberation at our April 20th meeting.,191,,
864,0.97,7482.842,7516.008,The office presentation on what the counsel Deliberated and the CBO forecast presentation will will comment opt other revenue streams and forecasts that do not go through the office of economic revenue forecast and an explanation of which ones do and don't go through those offenses and the city budget report out on our Quarrelly spending keeping an eye on those American rescue plan dollars and how not only they have been encumbered but we would like to know the time line for those as well.,191,,
865,0.97,7516.008,7523.048,Any other agenda items will be forth coming so thanks for your time today and generous time because we went a little over.,191,,
866,0.97,7523.048,7526.552,Have a great rest of your day and see you on April 20th.,191,,
867,0.97,7526.552,7526.819,Bye Bye.,191,,
