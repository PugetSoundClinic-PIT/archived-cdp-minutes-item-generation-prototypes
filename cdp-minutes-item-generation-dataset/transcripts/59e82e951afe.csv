69,0.97,432.999,441.34,The sad truth is SPD lead to the people of Seattle and the former Mayor who may be claims to have not been in control of the police during this time.,13,,
70,0.97,441.34,444.11,Where is your urgency to address this?,13,,
71,0.97,444.11,451.25,Are you able to immediately change leadership a step toward establishing trust that demonstrates you are here to protect your constituents?,13,,
72,0.97,451.25,463.362,Do you believe the root of falsely reporting on right wing Extremist activities and the abandonment of the East precinct were the only Ruses and lies Perpetwaited by SPD?,13,,

79,0.97,498.564,503.669,"Four, was there pressure on the Seattle times to hold the story until after the election?",13,,
80,0.97,503.669,507.573,Leadership takes a relationship to the Mayoral power in control of the city.,13,,
81,0.97,507.573,516.449,The Mayor continue to look at this as a situation that needs compromise or admit that So- called good faith negotiations have failed?,13,,
82,0.97,516.449,521.921,Thank you for the opportunity to speak today and please address this with urgency.,13,,

87,0.97,534.0,538.971,When the SPD engaged in their proud boys campaign.,15,,
88,0.97,538.971,540.673,It was one tactic among many.,15,,
89,0.97,540.673,544.744,"People in the street, myself included, knew within a day that they had been lied to.",15,,
90,0.97,544.744,548.247,We were being lied to all the time.,15,,
91,0.97,548.247,557.356,"Remember, around this time of prohibition against tear gas was ignored in favor of switching from one chemical irritant to the other.",15,,
92,0.97,557.356,565.431,"The thing that stopped aggression is when you, city Council, began Defunding SPD.",15,,
93,0.97,565.431,566.499,Not Reimagining and not retraining.,15,,
94,0.97,566.499,566.799,Defunding.,15,,
95,0.97,566.799,570.57,"For their part, what were the so-called accountability doing?",15,,
96,0.97,570.57,571.47,I honestly don't know.,15,,
97,0.97,571.47,575.007,It doesn't matter anyway because the individuals involved are not the problem.,15,,
98,0.97,575.007,579.779,Nor are they still employed in the Department to face any consequences or accountability today.,15,,
99,0.97,579.779,585.017,They knew well enough to quit or retire as soon as they could.,15,,
100,0.97,585.017,590.656,"Even the chief of police, Gaslighted chair Herbold at the time by telling her not to believe the news.",15,,
101,0.97,590.656,594.36,She did this in her professional capacity as a cop.,15,,
102,0.97,594.36,595.027,Is this what cops do.,15,,
103,0.97,595.027,596.796,They are trained to lie.,15,,
104,0.97,596.796,604.77,They cannot engage in good faith discussions about fixing their behavior because officers do not have the freedom to Disobey harmful order.,15,,
105,0.97,604.77,610.509,"It is not a problem with the individual people, it is a problem with the job description itself.",15,,
106,0.97,610.509,618.084,"This is what Council may try to call quote, traditional public safety.",15,,
107,0.97,618.084,618.384,It is not.,15,,
108,0.97,618.384,622.288,Accountability through the budget is the only way forward.,15,,
109,0.97,622.288,625.725,Thank you for listening.,15,,

113,0.97,632.465,632.732,Shannon.,16,,
114,0.97,632.732,632.965,Hi.,17,,
115,0.97,632.965,634.333,My name is Shannon.,17,,
116,0.97,634.333,639.505,I am a district seven constituent and part of a grass roots group focused on police accountability.,17,,
117,0.97,639.505,648.714,"Item about the June 8, 2020, SPD ruse.",17,,
118,0.97,648.714,653.185,"Among many others, I'm deeply troubled in the is aftermath of the abandonment of the East precinct.",17,,
119,0.97,653.185,668.2,"It is alarming that in an already strained situation, city employees are responsible for public safety, carried out spread misinformation, escalate tensions, and create dangerous conditions on our streets.",17,,
120,0.97,668.2,678.677,Even more upsetting is how the chain of command responsibility for this incident lies and the unacceptable lengthy delay in making these investigation results public.,17,,
121,0.97,678.677,690.189,"City Council members, I ask you to respond with urgency and use your powers of oversight over our city government to get to the bottom of how our system failed dramatically.",17,,
122,0.97,690.189,693.159,The specific questions previous comment outlined are excellent ones to address.,17,,
123,0.97,693.159,705.738,We cannot continue to rely on the never ending consent decree process or the struggling accountability system otherwise circumstances like these will happen over and over again.,17,,
124,0.97,705.738,711.944,"Council member Herbold, in particular, I saw live stream from summer 2020 where the three of you attended the protest.",17,,
125,0.97,711.944,718.084,Please stand with the public again to bear witness to what is broken in our system so we can move forward to change it.,17,,
126,0.97,718.084,718.918,Thank you.,17,,
127,0.97,718.918,720.419,"Thank you, Shannon.",18,,
128,0.97,720.419,727.927,"Our next Speaker is Eric, and Eric will be followed by Les Desiree.",18,,
129,0.97,727.927,728.127,Eric.,18,,
130,0.97,728.127,728.861,"Yes, good morning.",19,,
131,0.97,728.861,744.31,"My name is Eric, and I, too, am calling to speak on the topic of the ruse and especially to vocalize my utter contempt with which the explanations offered so far have been received.",19,,
132,0.97,744.31,750.082,This was not contrary to those explanations.,19,,
133,0.97,750.082,757.756,An instance of policing technique being Misaplayed to some situations for which it was not quite an appropriate fit.,19,,
134,0.97,757.756,768.067,What actually occurred here was first the Seattle police vacated the East precinct and completely suspended emergency public safety services in the neighborhood of the protest.,19,,
135,0.97,768.067,784.483,"And then having done that, they broadcast that a hostile group was on route to the protest location with the explicit intention of seeking a confrontation with protesters.",19,,
136,0.97,784.483,790.389,What possible foreseeable result could anybody have expected from that course of action?,19,,
137,0.97,790.389,793.692,There's no Tacticalobjective to be achieved here.,19,,
138,0.97,793.692,795.127,They abandoned the neighborhood.,19,,
139,0.97,795.127,797.296,There is no remotely plausible inference to be drawn here.,19,,
140,0.97,797.296,813.112,Other than that this was a deliberate choice by our police to create and inflame the conditions for violence which they did in a manner where the blame for what happened next could be fixed on protesters and on city's political leadership.,19,,
141,0.97,813.112,819.818,"So I urge the committee to ask themselves, has there been accountability for those involved?",19,,
142,0.97,819.818,825.624,Has there been an honest assessment of what the objective of this ruse was?,19,,
143,0.97,825.624,826.692,And what took place?,19,,
144,0.97,826.692,835.0,"Because if this report from OPA is what passes for accountability, for this police Department, then it is beyond reform.",19,,
145,0.97,835.0,839.038,It should be disbanded and replaced in its entirety.,19,,
146,0.97,839.038,840.406,Thank you.,19,,
147,0.97,840.406,841.14,Thank you.,20,,
148,0.97,841.14,848.247,The next Speaker is followed by Valerie.,20,,
149,0.97,848.247,857.99,Is Desiree with us?,21,,
150,0.97,857.99,864.964,"Remember to hit Star 6, Desiree.",22,,
151,0.97,864.964,866.832,"Desiree, you are showing as still muted.",22,,
152,0.97,866.832,871.804,"We need you to hit Star 6, please.",22,,
153,0.97,871.804,873.939,If you can hear us.,22,,
154,0.97,873.939,874.406,There you go.,22,,
155,0.97,874.406,875.541,Hello.,23,,
156,0.97,875.541,879.912,"Oh, there we go.",23,,
157,0.97,879.912,880.145,Sorry.,23,,
158,0.97,880.145,880.412,I'm new.,23,,
159,0.97,880.412,880.646,Hello.,23,,
160,0.97,880.646,880.946,Thank you.,23,,
161,0.97,880.946,884.416,I am Dez and I used to be a Seattle homeowner.,23,,
162,0.97,884.416,891.123,I also used to have a dream of once reopening Seattle's bakery.,23,,
163,0.97,891.123,892.524,"In 2020, I sold my home.",23,,
164,0.97,892.524,895.494,I moved away; and I pulled the plug on those plans.,23,,
165,0.97,895.494,902.034,"I want to tell you how that hoax that played out on the night of June 8, 2020, added to my decision to pull that plug.",23,,
166,0.97,902.034,915.648,"I would love to go into detail about my personal experiences on the ground June 8th, but I have given two minutes here, so I need to cut to the Chase and I'll be publishing the rest Online if anyone wants to hear it.",23,,
167,0.97,915.648,929.628,"So I guess we'll skip to all the important context stuff and I'll talk about the incident in question and that being the hoax that SPD, officers played on the public they spent nights Brewallizing and Gaslighting.",23,,
168,0.97,929.628,939.305,A hoax that is now somehow divorced from everything prior to that night and forgotten when discussing everything after.,23,,
169,0.97,939.305,943.242,I paid attention to how Seattle city leadership handled all of this.,23,,
170,0.97,943.242,945.911,I can see the bigger picture at play.,23,,
171,0.97,945.911,957.156,"And it cements my notion that I made the right decision, change my address, and pull the plug on trying to reestablish my beloved Seattle relic.",23,,
172,0.97,957.156,971.77,"Because there's no way I can see myself supporting a city that won't take accountability for the reckless and immature actions of their police officers actions that led to real fear, real rumors, real guns, real armed security, and real young people.",23,,
173,0.97,971.77,974.406,"We all can see that picture, right?",23,,
174,0.97,974.406,983.716,"That's part of what I say what I'm saying, it was a setup to derail the Blm movement and Delegitimize.",23,,
175,0.97,983.716,986.785,"It worked, and you continue to let it work.",23,,
176,0.97,986.785,988.754,"Stop it, do better.",23,,
177,0.97,988.754,992.558,"And I might bring back, and ice must be destroyed.",23,,
178,0.97,992.558,992.858,Thank you.,23,,

180,0.97,994.727,1002.234,"Our next Speaker is Valerie, Valerie will be followed by Sanders.",24,,
181,0.97,1002.234,1002.501,Valerie.,24,,
182,0.97,1002.501,1002.935,Good morning.,25,,
183,0.97,1002.935,1015.647,"I am Valerie, the story about SPD's proud boys ruse of June 2020 is not surprising nor is it surprising that the OPA took so long to investigate it that the clock ran out on discipline.",25,,
184,0.97,1015.647,1022.054,"In the meantime, we have local elections where police was an enormous issue.",25,,
185,0.97,1022.054,1026.058,The public didn't have the full story during the protests.,25,,
186,0.97,1026.058,1037.336,"In August, an investigator in the office of Inspector General made a detailed whistle blower complaint about the Oig's rubber stamping of investigations.",25,,
187,0.97,1037.336,1045.744,Issues related to the complaint have been investigated by Carolyn in the South Seattle Emerald over the past five months.,25,,
188,0.97,1045.744,1053.886,"The article is December 7, was investigating Oig complaints and city council's court, but SPC isn't acting.",25,,
189,0.97,1053.886,1074.673,"It reports that Council members Herbold and Lewis declined to act when the Oig whistle blower gave them detailed information about OPA investigations, and further, the council member Herbold consulted with the OPA about what information to reveal to a journalist.",25,,
190,0.97,1074.673,1086.185,"Council briefing yesterday, council member Herbold said she will ask to look again at the investigation of the proud boys ruse.",25,,
191,0.97,1086.185,1094.593,"Since it is at question, weighing in on this OPA investigation is not a we're in an endless cycle.",25,,
192,0.97,1094.593,1108.407,"It is past time for Council to do the right thing, instigate an impartial investigation of the OPA.",25,,
193,0.97,1108.407,1111.443,"Thank you, Valerie.",26,,
194,0.97,1111.443,1116.215,Our next Speaker is followed by David.,26,,
195,0.97,1116.215,1117.182,"Good morning, happy new year.",27,,
196,0.97,1117.182,1120.552,My name is Sanders and I live in district seven.,27,,
197,0.97,1120.552,1122.121,I'm speaking on agenda item one.,27,,
198,0.97,1122.121,1130.362,The new police chief has not been confirmed yet and a new police spot contract has not been negotiated yet.,27,,
199,0.97,1130.362,1137.469,The Council has responsibilities to approve these items.,27,,
200,0.97,1137.469,1138.17,Demand more accountability.,27,,
201,0.97,1138.17,1144.009,Doing so is repeating the cycle we have seen from the 2017 contract.,27,,
202,0.97,1144.009,1144.309,Thank you.,27,,
203,0.97,1144.309,1145.11,Thank you.,28,,
204,0.97,1145.11,1153.018,Our next Speaker is David Haines.,28,,
205,0.97,1153.018,1154.086,"Good morning, thank you.",29,,
206,0.97,1154.086,1156.922,I want to address the ruse and public health.,29,,
207,0.97,1156.922,1166.698,"We have a public health crisis with the disease that spreads Rapiddedly, letting sick, Vaccinated workers go back to work.",29,,
208,0.97,1166.698,1172.504,This began to spread throughout the nation because of Seattle and open border sanctuary.,29,,
209,0.97,1172.504,1176.074,No strategy to stop the spread has been noted.,29,,
210,0.97,1176.074,1181.947,It's all about chasing barriers for profits at expense of public health.,29,,
211,0.97,1181.947,1182.948,Government officials have proven incompetent.,29,,
212,0.97,1182.948,1200.365,"We also have a public safety crisis where society is Imloading because city council thinks exempting evil drug pushers from jail, who are committing crimes against humanity, and destroying lives daily, Imloading society, is best practices.",29,,
213,0.97,1200.365,1209.074,City Council has gone out of their way to appease devil's advocates of George Floyd protesters and Blm.,29,,
214,0.97,1209.074,1225.724,"By Browbeating cops spending more time on making a mountain out of a mole Hill about a legalized ruse to remind chop, that Kyle Rittenhouse type of person was going to show up to stop the violence in Capitol Hill.",29,,
215,0.97,1225.724,1241.206,"Yet there are bigger problem, such as an ill trained, unqualified police chief, and the civilian dispatch where some are racist, woke, Untrustworthy, playing politic tricks.",29,,
216,0.97,1241.206,1249.047,Recently I called the cops a few times about all these evil neighborhood . Y Pioneer square one time in the middle of the night.,29,,
217,0.97,1249.047,1252.851,It sounded like a kidnapping at Pioneer square.,29,,
218,0.97,1252.851,1265.03,"The civilian dispatch said, we have already been down there an hour ago and you already called twice today and I notice you called last night, too.",29,,
219,0.97,1265.03,1271.303,They are Browbeating me because I called about these horrible things.,29,,
220,0.97,1271.303,1280.278,Perhaps we need to boycott Seattle if the city council is going to continue to Implode our society.,29,,
221,0.97,1280.278,1287.653,"Our next Speaker is Carl, followed by bill Wilson.",30,,
222,0.97,1287.653,1290.889,& GT; hello.,31,,
223,0.97,1290.889,1291.723,My name is char Smith.,31,,
224,0.97,1291.723,1294.76,I live in the South end.,31,,
225,0.97,1294.76,1296.895,I am a teacher.,31,,
226,0.97,1296.895,1305.57,"And I have the Privileg to speak with you this morning because Unfortunately, teachers can't usually do that.",31,,
227,0.97,1305.57,1317.115,"Speaking to the ruse that was, it's a strange word to use, the Disinformation campaign that SPD played out in June 2020, I got to tell you.",31,,
228,0.97,1317.115,1318.984,I don't have some prepared statement.,31,,
229,0.97,1318.984,1321.253,I'm not here on behalf of some organization.,31,,
230,0.97,1321.253,1335.2,I was just somebody in the streets because I want the cops to stop shooting my neighbors and stop shooting had families related to my students.,31,,
231,0.97,1335.2,1344.976,"And when the precinct was abandoned, it was kind of assumed that the expectation was a setup.",31,,
232,0.97,1344.976,1358.857,"But when reports came in that there were groups of proud boys coming in to the area, I think it is understandable that a lot of people's reaction was to then bring guns into the Capitol Hill neighborhood.",31,,
233,0.97,1358.857,1368.7,Because the police were very clear and have always been clear that they will do nothing to prevent right wing agitators from harming protesters.,31,,
234,0.97,1368.7,1393.759,"For the people who had just been getting gassed and beaten, that was a rough moment and it is my hope, although definitely not my belief, that the city council will act in some meaningful way to take money away from SPD because that is the only thing that prevents this sort of behavior in the future.",31,,
235,0.97,1393.759,1406.104,"I really hope you all have some semblance of accountability plan that is meaningful, because in my entire lifetime, I have never seen anything close to that.",31,,
236,0.97,1406.104,1407.272,Best of luck.,31,,
237,0.97,1407.272,1407.973,Thank you.,32,,
238,0.97,1407.973,1412.477,"Our next Speaker, bill Wilson, is showing is not present.",32,,
239,0.97,1412.477,1418.416,We'll move down to Eric Sallinger.,32,,
240,0.97,1418.416,1418.617,Eric.,32,,
241,0.97,1418.617,1418.85,Hi.,33,,
242,0.97,1418.85,1420.952,I hope you guys can hear me.,33,,
243,0.97,1420.952,1422.921,My name is Eric Sallinger.,33,,
244,0.97,1422.921,1424.055,I live in district seven.,33,,
245,0.97,1424.055,1426.892,I called a number of times about the SPD response.,33,,
246,0.97,1426.892,1432.13,I think that there are a few things which are kind of missing from this discussion.,33,,
247,0.97,1432.13,1435.634,And I want to be clear.,33,,
248,0.97,1435.634,1444.242,The protest ruse is--I know OPA has to investigate it as a small part of a larger thing.,33,,
249,0.97,1444.242,1454.686,"I wasn't involved in these protests, I would watch people March by my home and see a Militarized response to peaceful protests.",33,,
250,0.97,1454.686,1455.654,I remember the Mayor got on TV.,33,,
251,0.97,1455.654,1464.229,I think some of the people in this meeting were also in that press conference and told us the proud boys were coming.,33,,
252,0.97,1464.229,1472.537,I remember watching protests around this country and people who committed violence against black lives matter protesters seemed to get away Scott free.,33,,
253,0.97,1472.537,1473.071,From whatever happened.,33,,
254,0.97,1473.071,1475.14,Both in Seattle and in other places.,33,,
255,0.97,1475.14,1483.248,I remember there was an incident where someone I believe related to a police officer drove their car into a group of protesters.,33,,
256,0.97,1483.248,1487.519,They were just peacefully arrested and taken into custody.,33,,
257,0.97,1487.519,1494.459,There's a lot of context which OPA says they can't really look at when they are doing these investigations.,33,,
258,0.97,1494.459,1495.527,Because they need to be Imparable.,33,,
259,0.97,1495.527,1502.033,But I think a lot of that context is really critically important.,33,,
260,0.97,1502.033,1515.914,"When you're spreading rumors that there is an armed group of Resur Gents downtown with guns, as someone who lives downtown and who just wants to walk his dog, I am worried because those people might mess with me.",33,,
261,0.97,1515.914,1527.192,"I am not involved in the protest, but now there are armed people with guns and I just watched downtown burn while the police Department took a hands off approach.",33,,
262,0.97,1527.192,1535.2,I just watched the police Department abandon a precinct.,33,,
263,0.97,1535.2,1537.802,"Earlier that year, I watched a mass shooting.",33,,
264,0.97,1537.802,1544.709,The ramifications of this stuff go way beyond just protesting and people's lives get directly impacted.,33,,
265,0.97,1544.709,1547.078,So thank you for your time.,33,,
266,0.97,1547.078,1549.014,I hope you guys do something.,33,,
267,0.97,1549.014,1551.85,"Thank you so much, Eric.",34,,
268,0.97,1551.85,1555.921,"With that, that concludes our public comment for this morning.",34,,
269,0.97,1555.921,1565.897,Thank you all for taking time out of your days to come and join us and your thoughts about today's agenda.,34,,
270,0.97,1565.897,1571.536,Just want to get things started here.,34,,
271,0.97,1571.536,1579.911,"As I mentioned, we're going to keep the timing on these items as tight as possible.",34,,
272,0.97,1579.911,1585.984,Will the clerk please read in agenda item one.,34,,
273,0.97,1585.984,1590.522,Agenda item number one.,35,,
274,0.97,1590.522,1592.891,"Opa investigation into June 8, 2020 ruse.",35,,
275,0.97,1592.891,1605.27,Just your name and your affiliation for everybody who is here presenting on this item this morning.,36,,
276,0.97,1605.27,1606.805,Thank you.,36,,
277,0.97,1606.805,1618.65,"I will--if somebody could get started, maybe senior deputy Harold, do you want to get started with the introductions, if you're with us?",37,,
278,0.97,1618.65,1618.883,Yes.,38,,
279,0.97,1618.883,1619.184,Thank you.,38,,
280,0.97,1619.184,1623.221,Thank you for allowing me to join today.,38,,
281,0.97,1623.221,1633.698,I am looking forward to hearing the updates and to working with Council to find real solutions to some of these challenges we're facing right now.,38,,
282,0.97,1633.698,1635.567,Thank you so much.,39,,
283,0.97,1635.567,1640.638,"Good morning, everyone, my name is Brandi grant, I'm the executive director of the deputy police Commission.",40,,
284,0.97,1640.638,1643.141,I want to thank you all for inviting me today.,40,,
285,0.97,1643.141,1655.086,I look forward to hearing the briefing and posing some simple questions and hopefully being able to work in collaboration with you all to come up with solutions to this situation.,40,,
286,0.97,1655.086,1656.254,Thank you.,40,,
287,0.97,1656.254,1659.224,"Good morning, everyone, Andrew Myerberg from OPA, thank you for having me.",41,,
288,0.97,1659.224,1664.095,Thank you for being here.,42,,
289,0.97,1664.095,1671.069,I want to recognize Council member Juarez for being here with us today.,42,,
290,0.97,1671.069,1673.672,Some quick introductory remarks because time is limited.,42,,
291,0.97,1673.672,1683.248,"We're going to discuss today, I believe, RAISES two sets of issues.",42,,
292,0.97,1683.248,1692.19,"First, under state law, are implemented and I for one believe that Ruses need additional supervisor oversight and must be documented.",42,,
293,0.97,1692.19,1703.334,We only know about this case in an earlier 2029 case because of constituent immediate investigations.,42,,
294,0.97,1703.334,1704.402,Oversight is an important issue.,42,,
295,0.97,1704.402,1723.121,"I have contacted both the office of the inspector general and Oig is working to ensure that policy changes address concerns raised by these cases and is also raising important questions of whether despite state law, making Ruses legal, whether or not a renewed look is needed.",42,,
296,0.97,1723.121,1744.342,"The second issue is one of trust, addressed in the report, which includes that the use of the ruse resulted in fear and alarm among community members who contacted me that evening about the use of the ruse resulting in my reaching out to then chief best.",42,,
297,0.97,1744.342,1754.352,"On the process for discipline for sustained findings, there is a meeting at OPA with SPD management and the city attorney to discuss this case.",42,,
298,0.97,1754.352,1764.929,"If there is the need for further investigation and what the appropriate range of discipline should be, they discuss that.",42,,
299,0.97,1764.929,1770.668,That meeting did take place yesterday and the next step will be to present the case to the chief.,42,,
300,0.97,1770.668,1773.771,They are seeking to do that this week.,42,,
301,0.97,1773.771,1792.924,"Last week, SPD noted to my office the chief will not have much to say before he can go through this process to avoid any future appeal issues about findings, before the completion of the process.",42,,
302,0.97,1792.924,1818.483,"So just, if you're wondering about the absence of the chief here this morning, that is because of his effort, appropriate efforts to make sure that he does not speak to issues that then again could be used to appeal possible discipline and findings coming out of this case.",42,,
303,0.97,1818.483,1822.22,I want to thank director Myerberg for being here to present.,42,,
304,0.97,1822.22,1832.163,"We are also joined by both senior deputy Mayor, and the CPC executive director, Brandi grant.",42,,
305,0.97,1832.163,1840.772,"If there are no further opening remark, I think we'll just get right into the presentation from director Myerberg.",42,,
306,0.97,1840.772,1854.452,"I would like to leave as much time as possible for questions and for questions that we're not able to get to, we can, of course, work to compile them and send them on afterwards.",42,,
307,0.97,1854.452,1860.925,"So if there are no objections, I'm going to hand it over to director Myerberg.",42,,
308,0.97,1860.925,1862.76,"Great, thank you very much.",43,,
309,0.97,1862.76,1874.172,"I will keep--what I wanted to do was give an overview of how this case came to us and how we investigated it, and again like Council member Herbold said, leave as much time for questions.",43,,
310,0.97,1874.172,1879.844,I know there are a lot of them here from the group.,43,,
311,0.97,1879.844,1883.615,"So, we first learned of this case in November of 2020.",43,,
312,0.97,1883.615,1888.82,That's when it was flagged for us by Omari.,43,,
313,0.97,1888.82,1904.435,"Initially, it was a request to our office about whether or not there was any Video showing the proud boys in the vicinity of city hall, volunteer Park, and going to the chop area.",43,,
314,0.97,1904.435,1917.815,"Immediately after receiving that inquiry, we did a search basically for all radio traffic and body mark Video that were recorded that may have shown anything regarding the proud boys and nothing was located.",43,,
315,0.97,1917.815,1923.221,We communicated back and forth with asking him if he had any additional information.,43,,
316,0.97,1923.221,1923.554,He did not.,43,,
317,0.97,1923.554,1930.128,"At that point, because of the lack of information; we initiated a full investigation.",43,,
318,0.97,1930.128,1934.966,"So, this case was challenging in a number of respects.",43,,
319,0.97,1934.966,1939.537,"First of all, council member Herbold flagged, there was a lack of documentation.",43,,
320,0.97,1939.537,1946.978,So there was no documentation that a ruse or any sort of misinformation or Disinformation effort had opinion used first of all.,43,,
321,0.97,1946.978,1953.785,"Second of all, no after action report or any accounting of who was involved, who supervised it, anything.",43,,
322,0.97,1953.785,1961.492,"In fact, there was simply an absence of evidence aside from an Audio recording that was provided from OPA.",43,,
323,0.97,1961.492,1975.707,"So, ultimately, what we ended up doing, we spoke to as many people as we could within the Department, and we were informed by someone at the intelligence unit that there may have been this effort run through Seattle police operations center.",43,,
324,0.97,1975.707,1979.377,"After receiving that information, we reached out to Spoc.",43,,
325,0.97,1979.377,1987.385,"What they informed us, yes, this may have occurred and it was Supervisorred and commanded by named employee one.",43,,
326,0.97,1987.385,1993.991,"Once we received that information, we started to narrow down the investigation and we interviewed him.",43,,
327,0.97,1993.991,2001.366,"As part of that interview, he gave a general overview of what the effort was and why it was done.",43,,
328,0.97,2001.366,2013.01,He also identified an officer who was named employee 2 in our case summary who was involved in coordinating the ruse and bringing officers on to participate in it.,43,,
329,0.97,2013.01,2014.545,We then interviewed that officer.,43,,
330,0.97,2014.545,2016.848,He identified other officers that may have been involved.,43,,
331,0.97,2016.848,2023.421,We began a process of interviewing officers to playing them the Audio recording.,43,,
332,0.97,2023.421,2029.027,"Having them identify their voices and if they could, identify other officers as well.",43,,
333,0.97,2029.027,2032.397,"We ended up conducting, I believe, over ten interviews with a number of officers.",43,,
334,0.97,2032.397,2038.336,Some we were able to identify were not on the recording.,43,,
335,0.97,2038.336,2045.309,"Ultimately, we were able to identify all the officers on the Audio recording.",43,,
336,0.97,2045.309,2047.178,"Again, we were very hand strung with this investigation.",43,,
337,0.97,2047.178,2050.314,We don't have a list of the officers.,43,,
338,0.97,2050.314,2059.357,"And if the ones that were playing Audio four can't identify the other officers, some respects, won't identify officers, unfortunately, we're stuck with that information.",43,,
339,0.97,2059.357,2066.664,We have no way to match up voices against the 700 other patrol officers that are within the Seattle police Department.,43,,
340,0.97,2066.664,2073.638,"So, we were in some respects, stuck with the information that we received during the course of the investigation.",43,,
341,0.97,2073.638,2085.45,"Once we were able to identify all the officers that we could, that were involved in the effort, we interviewed each of them and asked them, you know, what were you told?",43,,
342,0.97,2085.45,2086.751,What were you instructed?,43,,
343,0.97,2086.751,2088.619,What guidance were you given?,43,,
344,0.97,2088.619,2099.43,What became very clear was that the answer was that there was virtually no supervision or guidance provided to any of the officers.,43,,
345,0.97,2099.43,2113.644,"This ruse or this effort was created by named employee one, who did not provide significant supervision to named employee two, who did not provide significant supervision to all other officers.",43,,
346,0.97,2113.644,2120.751,There were other officers that did use misinformation as well during the course of subsequent days.,43,,
347,0.97,2120.751,2125.022,"However, that information was generally talking about movies they had watched or what food they had eaten.",43,,
348,0.97,2125.022,2131.863,There was no other ruse that was the same as the proud boy language that was used on June 8th.,43,,
349,0.97,2131.863,2141.706,So that's why we focused our investigations on named employee one and named employee two and the officers involved.,43,,
350,0.97,2141.706,2155.72,"In evaluating this case, you know, we certainly felt that and I don't want to mince words, this was a really poor decision from all aspects of SPD officers involved in this case.",43,,
351,0.97,2155.72,2158.089,I don't know if there's any way around that.,43,,
352,0.97,2158.089,2161.425,It was a bad idea not just to use Disinformation.,43,,
353,0.97,2161.425,2167.431,"I don't know if it was necessary, but also to use the proud boys as part of that misinformation.",43,,
354,0.97,2167.431,2177.942,"I think what was clear was that the East precinct had just been walked away from, being formulated, tensions were high.",43,,
355,0.97,2177.942,2189.153,"Prior to the ruse being learned about, folks had already brought firearms and of course there was a possibility that things could become escalated.",43,,
356,0.97,2189.153,2200.431,"So in our minds, using that ruse served, again, as we said, pour fuel on the fuel, to take a heightened situation to make more so.",43,,
357,0.97,2200.431,2205.97,So I wanted to discuss really quickly the policy recommendations.,43,,
358,0.97,2205.97,2212.376,"One thing that Council member Herbold flagged, part of our case summary.",43,,
359,0.97,2212.376,2220.251,One thing is important to note is that we use the ruse policy because it was the best fit for this case.,43,,
360,0.97,2220.251,2225.022,But really this isn't a true ruse.,43,,
361,0.97,2225.022,2227.558,"Really this is a misinformation, Disinformation campaign.",43,,
362,0.97,2227.558,2229.46,I think the closest policy is the ruse.,43,,
363,0.97,2229.46,2231.696,That's why we evaluate it under the ruse policy.,43,,
364,0.97,2231.696,2237.868,I do think there is significant merit in reevaluating the policy from top to bottom.,43,,
365,0.97,2237.868,2243.674,"Right now with the policy does, it defines the times that a ruse can be used.",43,,
366,0.97,2243.674,2244.575,That's consistent with state law.,43,,
367,0.97,2244.575,2249.88,What it doesn't do is it doesn't provide guidance as to what types of Ruses can be used.,43,,
368,0.97,2249.88,2250.348,What can you say?,43,,
369,0.97,2250.348,2252.283,What can you not say?,43,,
370,0.97,2252.283,2253.784,How should you document it?,43,,
371,0.97,2253.784,2262.793,"That is one thing we pushed for from the 2019 case, which you all remember, was the case that tragically resulted in his suicide.",43,,
372,0.97,2262.793,2269.967,One of the things we recommended was all officers received training on exactly this.,43,,
373,0.97,2269.967,2276.54,"Using the case as an example, here's when you should be using a ruse and here's when you should not be.",43,,
374,0.97,2276.54,2277.475,Spd did require training.,43,,
375,0.97,2277.475,2288.052,"It was done through roll calls and not a training Module or training class, which is what we suggested to ensure uniform.",43,,
376,0.97,2288.052,2289.787,I know Council member Herbold as well.,43,,
377,0.97,2289.787,2293.691,I believe they are in progress of revamping the policy.,43,,
378,0.97,2293.691,2303.968,"I don't know whether they will go so far as to ban Ruses, they will include new parameters when they can be used and a documentation requirement.",43,,
379,0.97,2303.968,2319.684,"With regard to the documentation in this case, wasn't documented anywhere.",43,,
380,0.97,2319.684,2321.852,I think that was --,43,,
381,0.97,2321.852,2326.557,Sounds like we are having a Connectivity problem.,44,,
382,0.97,2326.557,2329.226,I don't know if I gloss over anything.,45,,
383,0.97,2329.226,2342.106,I'm happy to turn this over for folks for questioning or to see time to Miss grant or senior deputy Mayor Heroll.,45,,
384,0.97,2342.106,2349.747,Can you restate the last point you made?,46,,
385,0.97,2349.747,2350.948,With regarding documentation.,47,,
386,0.97,2350.948,2365.563,"Yeah, so I was surprised, one of the things that was surprising for us in this case was the absence of documentation given that the ruse was officially sanctioned or the effort was officially sanctioned by members of the chain of command.",48,,
387,0.97,2365.563,2369.567,It was done as part of demonstration management.,48,,
388,0.97,2369.567,2379.844,"Generally, we would expect those types of things to have been documented in an after action report or in some official log to say this is what was done and these are the people that participated in it.",48,,
389,0.97,2379.844,2387.952,"The fact that was not done resulted in a finding, a sustained finding, because of the expectation that would be completed.",48,,
390,0.97,2387.952,2394.992,I do think there is significant merit in requiring any time a ruse is going to be used to have it documented.,48,,
391,0.97,2394.992,2398.129,I don't think it would be over complicated to do so.,48,,
392,0.97,2398.129,2407.238,"I also don't think that to our point, OPA, passed the issue to occur.",48,,
393,0.97,2407.238,2416.714,"Spd should be changing policies all the time and I think this is something where on their own motion, they should be changing and modifying and I believe they are.",48,,
394,0.97,2416.714,2417.248,Thank you so much.,49,,
395,0.97,2417.248,2433.531,"Before we put it up for questions, I will want to give senior deputy Mayor Harrell and director grant an opportunity to speak and then we'll open up for questions.",49,,
396,0.97,2433.531,2434.932,Before we get to that.,49,,
397,0.97,2434.932,2450.447,"Dr. Myerberg, because there were questions raised about the thoroughness of the investigation, can you just kind of run through quickly what the investigation consisted of?",49,,
398,0.97,2450.447,2450.714,Sure.,50,,
399,0.97,2450.714,2457.454,"So, basically, what we did here was we looked at, first of all, we analyzed the Audio recording that was provided to us.",50,,
400,0.97,2457.454,2460.691,We don't have access to other Audio recordings.,50,,
401,0.97,2460.691,2465.529,What we later learned is there is a longer Audio recording.,50,,
402,0.97,2465.529,2469.867,We listened to it up to 10:30 P.M.,50,,
403,0.97,2469.867,2476.774,"There was an Audio recording went to midnight, where two other call signs were used by unknown officers.",50,,
404,0.97,2476.774,2479.543,"So, that was something that we were not aware of.",50,,
405,0.97,2479.543,2486.016,It may very well be the case that it was the same officers that used those call signs.,50,,
406,0.97,2486.016,2490.187,What I would say is we ask every single officer we brought in.,50,,
407,0.97,2490.187,2495.492,We asked whose voices do you hear and who was involved in the effort?,50,,
408,0.97,2495.492,2501.131,"And what we received, what we believe was a full accounting of those.",50,,
409,0.97,2501.131,2511.509,"However, given the existence of additional Video, we are open to doing a further inquiry to bring the officers back in and ask them about recognizing voices.",50,,
410,0.97,2511.509,2517.381,"The reality is though, just like with our initial investigation, we are in many ways stuck with what we get from the officers.",50,,
411,0.97,2517.381,2530.294,"If they say no, we don't recognize one, or they don't disclose any more names, which I don't expect will occur, there's no other documentation.",50,,
412,0.97,2530.294,2530.895,There's no other records.,50,,
413,0.97,2530.895,2536.834,There's no other materials that we can use to cross reference and figure that out.,50,,
414,0.97,2536.834,2539.603,I think that was perhaps the biggest gap in the investigation.,50,,
415,0.97,2539.603,2542.973,But one that we are happy to keep looking at and remedy.,50,,
416,0.97,2542.973,2555.019,"With regard to the other aspects of the investigation, I would say it was complete and thorough and obviously as we discussed, certified.",50,,
417,0.97,2555.019,2573.771,"I think the other criticism that I have seen of the investigation, and I think it has Meritt, it is focused on this ruse instead of looking at the broader picture of misinformation or Disinformation provided by SPD, and from our perspective, that is for a reason.",50,,
418,0.97,2573.771,2575.739,Our investigations are focused on individual incidents.,50,,
419,0.97,2575.739,2585.082,"We don't look at, you know, a series of incidents and to have that more likely or less likely than the incident we're looking at occur or didn't occur.",50,,
420,0.97,2585.082,2594.291,"From our perspective, that is much better suited to the office of Inspector general, they can do those assessments.",50,,
421,0.97,2594.291,2604.301,"I believe that right now, they are conducting the stage 2 review assessment in which deals with chop.",50,,
422,0.97,2604.301,2614.612,I would assume that this finding and this investigation as well as the Disinformation used in and around will be essential to that review.,50,,
423,0.97,2614.612,2619.316,And then I think if there are additional questions after that review.,50,,
424,0.97,2619.316,2631.729,I think the Council would be situated well to address those and to evaluate them.,50,,
425,0.97,2631.729,2635.065,"Thank you, Myerberg.",51,,
426,0.97,2635.065,2640.504,Would you share your thoughts and your observations?,51,,
427,0.97,2640.504,2640.938,"Yes, absolutely.",52,,
428,0.97,2640.938,2650.514,"I apologize, they are not going to be quite as organized, but I want to make a couple points.",52,,
429,0.97,2650.514,2659.089,"One of which is, you know, I like many others was made aware of this case through an article on the Seattle times.",52,,
430,0.97,2659.089,2666.597,And this was Daylighted for investigation by converge media and other sources on the ground.,52,,
431,0.97,2666.597,2670.701,And that cannot be how we operate.,52,,
432,0.97,2670.701,2696.627,"I believe that if we truly want accountability within our system, we can't be allowed to have these facts obscured and I can only share that for any amount of legitimacy of the system, we have to be focused on transparency.",52,,
433,0.97,2696.627,2706.503,"It does bother me a tremendous amount, that there was no documentation for Mr.",52,,
434,0.97,2706.503,2707.171,Myerberg's presentation.,52,,
435,0.97,2707.171,2710.841,There was no documentation about what was happening.,52,,
436,0.97,2710.841,2715.879,"Truly if this were a legitimate operation, there would have been documentation around it.",52,,
437,0.97,2715.879,2720.984,It wouldn't have taken outside sources today light it.,52,,
438,0.97,2720.984,2731.862,It would have been part of our after actions as a city around what happened around chop Chaz.,52,,
439,0.97,2731.862,2736.934,"So, I am somewhat relieved with what happens in the dark will come to light.",52,,
440,0.97,2736.934,2746.91,I look forward to working with the Council to be able to figure out how this doesn't happen again in the future.,52,,
441,0.97,2746.91,2754.017,But also have to admit that this really doubles down on our desire to need to dig deeper.,52,,
442,0.97,2754.017,2768.766,To dig deeper to the things that we didn't even--that we did not know were occurring and to ensure that we dig deep enough to fix what is rotten here.,52,,
443,0.97,2768.766,2775.739,"So, I want to thank you for allowing me to have a few moments today.",52,,
444,0.97,2775.739,2785.749,I want to thank you for for--I know that the Council will be partners in working with us on this.,52,,
445,0.97,2785.749,2793.657,"I know it won't be easy, but we have to do it on behalf of the city.",52,,
446,0.97,2793.657,2799.997,"I too, look forward to problem solving around this and other areas.",53,,
447,0.97,2799.997,2804.468,"I see Council member Lewis, that you are first in the Cue for questions.",53,,
448,0.97,2804.468,2815.813,"I do want to give director grant an opportunity to say a few words as well, because I know that Ruses have long been a concern of the Commission.",53,,
449,0.97,2815.813,2826.49,"I believe there was a meeting that public meeting, a meeting at the end of last year where this was a topic of discussion.",53,,
450,0.97,2826.49,2838.101,"Maybe not specifically this case, but the policy around Ruses and just really want to give director grant an opportunity to uplift some of their concerns and questions around this.",53,,
451,0.97,2838.101,2844.908,And I know they have some pending requests of the police Department as well.,53,,
452,0.97,2844.908,2845.509,"So, director grant.",53,,
453,0.97,2845.509,2848.946,Thank you Council member Herbold.,54,,
454,0.97,2848.946,2849.947,"Also, too, want to concur.",54,,
455,0.97,2849.947,2851.782,Thank you for inviting us here.,54,,
456,0.97,2851.782,2854.484,I want to thank the public Commenters who spoke today.,54,,
457,0.97,2854.484,2867.264,I only have a few additional questions because the points they brought up were so pertinent to many of the things that were shared.,54,,
458,0.97,2867.264,2872.169,"I think director Myerberg, a couple things for me and the Pcp.",54,,
459,0.97,2872.169,2876.206,The point of clarification around the absence of evidence early on.,54,,
460,0.97,2876.206,2889.119,"I think my biggest question would be, you know, per OPA procedures, when there is a lack of evidence or there's absence of it early on, what type of steps are you all taking to make sure that findings are validated?",54,,
461,0.97,2889.119,2893.891,You have enough information and how you're going about those processes.,54,,
462,0.97,2893.891,2898.662,Is there thoughts and plans of what you all will do when cases like this arise in the future?,54,,
463,0.97,2898.662,2907.471,"And then I think, too, it would be helpful to have a better understanding of the misinformation versus Disinformation in Ruses.",54,,
464,0.97,2907.471,2911.275,"To me, this was in fact, just that, a ruse.",54,,
465,0.97,2911.275,2915.779,"The clarity around that particular sentence, I would love to be able to hear a bit more about.",54,,
466,0.97,2915.779,2929.126,"But one of the biggest questions that the CPC had was, you know, from the complaint to the chief desk, to beyond that, why was the complaint so far beyond the 180 days?",54,,
467,0.97,2929.126,2932.696,Why did it take so long for this to be reviewed?,54,,
468,0.97,2932.696,2939.503,"A case of this magnitude, is there a priority system you are going to put in place when cases of this nature come across your desk?",54,,
469,0.97,2939.503,2948.679,"I feel like it was really Disheartening to have, even though I'm thankful for Mr.",54,,
470,0.97,2948.679,2949.947,"Salsbury, the deputy Mayor is correct.",54,,
471,0.97,2949.947,2959.556,We should not have had that Daylighted by a journalist who had also Incured a lot of the trauma from that particular day among community members.,54,,
472,0.97,2959.556,2975.072,"I would really love to hear why it took so long and then if there are going to be cases where it is going to take that long, we should really be considering the negative impact of what those particular findings are going to be when they are delayed.",54,,
473,0.97,2975.072,2981.345,And what commitment do you have to community to make sure we are informed in some aspect along the way.,54,,
474,0.97,2981.345,2991.722,"If there are delays, problematic findings, issues that arise, I feel like it is time for us to go back and look at what the procedures are that are put in place.",54,,
475,0.97,2991.722,3003.867,"It was extremely traumatic, the events that took place, and to have almost now going into honestly, year two, for us to be talking about this, with no actual conclusion or solution is very troublesome.",54,,
476,0.97,3003.867,3007.104,And I do have many other questions to Followup on.,54,,
477,0.97,3007.104,3012.876,I am completely comfortable with making sure Council gets to ask their questions.,54,,
478,0.97,3012.876,3019.916,The Commission will be following up with some more informational requests that we have after this meeting concludes.,54,,
479,0.97,3019.916,3021.118,"So, again, I want to thank you.",54,,
480,0.97,3021.118,3026.79,"I want to put those things on your mind, director Myerberg and Council.",54,,
481,0.97,3026.79,3039.136,"I hope you also who, in tandem with us to make sure they are taking the situation seriously so we can make sure it never happens again.",54,,
482,0.97,3039.136,3043.273,"Thank you, Dr. Myerberg, did you want to respond to that?",55,,
483,0.97,3043.273,3045.242,"Yeah, I can respond to that.",56,,
484,0.97,3045.242,3047.177,There were three questions I'll respond.,56,,
485,0.97,3047.177,3050.914,I think I heard and can respond to them.,56,,
486,0.97,3050.914,3070.267,"So, for cases that have a lack of documentation, I would say it's rare that we would have this type of a case where there was a high level decision made to use a ruse or whatever you want to refer to it, where there would be no documentation.",56,,
487,0.97,3070.267,3070.634,This was rare.,56,,
488,0.97,3070.634,3080.343,"There are other cases, for example, we knew that someone was subjected to police force, but we couldn't find them because we didn't have a description.",56,,
489,0.97,3080.343,3083.48,We weren't able to speak to them.,56,,
490,0.97,3083.48,3087.951,"We would have to look through Video, we had a lot of difficulty locating them.",56,,
491,0.97,3087.951,3103.5,"With this type of a case where there's no documentation of again, a high level effort is abnormal.",56,,
492,0.97,3103.5,3106.269,"Sorry, I think I was out for a little bit.",56,,
493,0.97,3106.269,3114.911,"Certainly we can come up with ways to Protocalls to address this type of a case moving forward, but again, this is very, very rare.",56,,
494,0.97,3114.911,3119.249,I have never seen anything quite like it before and I don't know whether we'll see it again.,56,,
495,0.97,3119.249,3121.718,That doesn't mean we have plans in place to address that.,56,,
496,0.97,3121.718,3124.955,With regard to your second question.,56,,
497,0.97,3124.955,3135.365,"I guess the distinction I was making is that generally when you think of a ruse, a ruse occurs in the context of a criminal investigation.",56,,
498,0.97,3135.365,3141.137,"For example, during an interrogation, someone says, we have your fingerprints on this cup, what do you say to that?",56,,
499,0.97,3141.137,3142.639,That is a true ruse.,56,,
500,0.97,3142.639,3157.787,"Where this was more of a formal effort that was done organized by the chain of command so maybe it's an issue of scope, where I'm referring to it as a misinformation versus a ruse.",56,,
501,0.97,3157.787,3164.06,"Both are the same, in which you are providing false information to achieve a law enforcement goal.",56,,
502,0.97,3164.06,3165.362,You could address both through the same policy.,56,,
503,0.97,3165.362,3170.834,"I would be careful to say, within the policy, you'll make that change is to refer it both.",56,,
504,0.97,3170.834,3175.805,"Not just talk about Ruses, as a patrol officer would think about them.",56,,
505,0.97,3175.805,3180.177,Also think about sanctioned Disinformation efforts and potentially consider banning that all together.,56,,
506,0.97,3180.177,3183.613,If you allow Ruses to occur.,56,,
507,0.97,3183.613,3190.22,"With regard to the last question, I think it RAISES two really important questions.",56,,
508,0.97,3190.22,3193.156,First is the timing of the investigation.,56,,
509,0.97,3193.156,3203.3,What I would say is that the investigation started in December when we realized that we had no information that we needed to open up an investigation.,56,,
510,0.97,3203.3,3205.835,We started it in December of 2020.,56,,
511,0.97,3205.835,3211.007,"When we proceeded through the investigation, for much of the investigation, we did not have employees.",56,,
512,0.97,3211.007,3212.809,Meaning we didn't know who was involved.,56,,
513,0.97,3212.809,3227.324,"We spent a lot of time trying to assess who was involved, who made the statements, what statements were made, and then during the course of that investigation, we started to identify folks and to put them in as named employees.",56,,
514,0.97,3227.324,3231.828,"The investigator on that case, this is just purely resource issues TA are important to note.",56,,
515,0.97,3231.828,3242.472,"The investigator in that case, because the first named employee was a captain and an assistant chief.",56,,
516,0.97,3242.472,3244.04,"Opa, we have two supervisors.",56,,
517,0.97,3244.04,3254.751,"That's the same supervisor working on the East precinct case, helping work on the January 6th case that was supervising, you know, nearly 100 other cases and had a full case load.",56,,
518,0.97,3254.751,3256.886,So simply because of band width.,56,,
519,0.97,3256.886,3261.324,That supervisor is doing the best they can.,56,,
520,0.97,3261.324,3265.528,No one else is allowed to work on that case based on contracts.,56,,
521,0.97,3265.528,3272.402,"We identified as many people as we identified, we provided it to the Oig and they returned with a certification.",56,,
522,0.97,3272.402,3276.606,There was another delay on the back end with the writing of the findings.,56,,
523,0.97,3276.606,3279.042,I was out on Paternity leave for 30 days.,56,,
524,0.97,3279.042,3282.212,I was unable to write the case up during that time.,56,,
525,0.97,3282.212,3284.347,The other part of it.,56,,
526,0.97,3284.347,3291.988,"During the 60 days I wasn't in the office, I had to write up between 80 to 85 other cases.",56,,
527,0.97,3291.988,3300.93,"Again, pursuant to ordinance, I have to write up each one of those cases, and looking at hundreds of hours of Video, hundreds of documents.",56,,
528,0.97,3300.93,3312.776,"That's not an excuse, I'm not thrilled about the delay in the case, it's a simple of the reality of the workload that we had and I personally had as the director based on my job description.",56,,
529,0.97,3312.776,3330.593,"So, but to your second point, which I think is important, director grant, is can we create some sort of a mechanism to, I mean, we have a priority mechanism, generally we focus on sustained cases that have pending 180 day deadlines.",56,,
530,0.97,3330.593,3337.867,"The named employees, to whom sustain findings retired during the course of the investigation, so the 180 day no longer was applicable for them.",56,,
531,0.97,3337.867,3345.275,"That being said, it is a matter of public concern and that is obviously my frustration about not getting it done sooner.",56,,
532,0.97,3345.275,3358.888,"But certainly I would be happy to talk to the Commission about how we Prioritize cases and if you have ideas on how we can make Notifications to the public about cases that may be coming up, what those cases involve, I would like to hear it.",56,,
533,0.97,3358.888,3364.16,"We do use our dash board, which is our general outline of the cases pending for the protest.",56,,
534,0.97,3364.16,3370.9,"Maybe there is a better way to do it to avoid, like you said.",56,,
535,0.97,3370.9,3379.442,"Again, I regret that in some respects, it's unavoidable.",56,,
536,0.97,3379.442,3381.144,Sorry.,56,,
537,0.97,3381.144,3383.246,Thank you Dr. Myerberg.,57,,
538,0.97,3383.246,3384.047,"Council member Lewis, thank you.",57,,
539,0.97,3384.047,3386.983,I recognize you've had your hand up in the Queue for awhile.,57,,
540,0.97,3386.983,3387.951,Thank you Madame chair.,58,,
541,0.97,3387.951,3407.737,It's good to be back here on the committee and in 2022 and certainly welcome Council member Nelson and welcome senior deputy Harrell.,58,,
542,0.97,3407.737,3419.749,"When we go back to the events of the summer of 2020, which for everybody was a really challenging time and just want to make space for that and acknowledge that.",58,,
543,0.97,3419.749,3433.296,One of the documents that I keep going back to and I think is grounding for our conversation today as we seek accountability for police actions that occurred during that time is judge Jones temporary restraining order.,58,,
544,0.97,3433.296,3463.993,"And just as table setting, I go back to that whenever we are doing a hearing like this, for the section where you know, Judge Jones determined that the use of force and the tactics SPD was using would stop a person from protesters, Judge Jones agreed with the plaintiffs and said they had a strong likelihood of success, SPD targeted protesters because they were protesting the police.",58,,
545,0.97,3463.993,3475.171,The police used tactics and a level of force that was motivated by being more extreme and harsher because of the topic of the speech that the protesters were using.,58,,
546,0.97,3475.171,3489.652,"I go back to those, because I think when we have these conversations, we need to center what we're talking about and looking at this whole episode in our history that we had a Department that was engaged in concerning activity.",58,,
547,0.97,3489.652,3508.404,"The questions I have today about this investigation is one episode in a whole bunch of episodes that led an article 3 judge appointed by a President confirmed by the U.S. Senate, to say that our police Department was being specifically brutal to protesters because they were protesting the police.",58,,
548,0.97,3508.404,3515.478,I just want us to keep that in mind on the importance of getting to the bottom of some of these episodes.,58,,
549,0.97,3515.478,3531.794,"And I want to start, maybe, director Myerberg, if you could give more background on the Spoc, which was the body where this particular tactic was run through, just so the audience and everyone on the committee knows the role of that body.",58,,
550,0.97,3531.794,3533.463,I have a couple questions related to that.,58,,
551,0.97,3533.463,3539.702,I just want to make sure we are all working from the same baseline.,58,,
552,0.97,3539.702,3546.075,"Yeah, it's a special operations center located in the West precinct.",59,,
553,0.97,3546.075,3549.512,"Generally during demonstrations, that's the command center for operations.",59,,
554,0.97,3549.512,3574.037,"My question is, from reading about this in the Seattle times from reviewing the OPA report, there's been a lot of coverage that this operation that was run through Spoc was apparently not known to anyone but captain Granno.",60,,
555,0.97,3574.037,3587.216,"Captain Grannon was going to run this operation in his mind, to Descalate tensions, in into thinking there was a protest.",60,,
556,0.97,3587.216,3602.999,"My question for director Myerberg would be based on your kind of knowledge and understanding of the Department, is it common that the chief, Amayor, assistant chiefs wouldn't know that this operation was occurring?",60,,
557,0.97,3602.999,3605.501,I would say nothing about this case is common.,61,,
558,0.97,3605.501,3608.471,I think that is just kind of at the outset.,61,,
559,0.97,3608.471,3610.44,I think that's the reality.,61,,
560,0.97,3610.44,3612.175,It is really difficult to answer.,61,,
561,0.97,3612.175,3613.543,I have never seen that happen.,61,,
562,0.97,3613.543,3616.879,I have never seen this happen before.,61,,
563,0.97,3616.879,3618.715,"You know, we spoke to the chief.",61,,
564,0.97,3618.715,3631.828,"We spoke to the assistant chief of patrol, and all said that they did not know about the specifics of the operation that was on going.",61,,
565,0.97,3631.828,3644.14,"At that time running Spoc, is it possible information was not shared and was kept within Spoc, it's possible.",61,,
566,0.97,3644.14,3653.049,But I have no indication that the accounts ever given to our investigation investigator were inaccurate.,61,,
567,0.97,3653.049,3653.883,I can't answer that question.,61,,
568,0.97,3653.883,3655.518,I don't know the answer to it.,61,,
569,0.97,3655.518,3658.554,I guess just as a general concern.,62,,
570,0.97,3658.554,3666.162,If it was one incident where people didn't know what was going on with their commanders and with people on the ground.,62,,
571,0.97,3666.162,3666.562,I could get that.,62,,
572,0.97,3666.562,3684.947,"But there's now a number of data points from our sort of examination of some of these specific incidents, where people didn't know what was going on and things bubbled up into being horrifying violations of the right to people in the city.",62,,
573,0.97,3684.947,3695.625,"You know, the abandonment of the East Precinct, apparently no one knew about that except assistant chief Mahathy.",62,,
574,0.97,3695.625,3703.232,"You know, there's been some different accounts based on some of the reporting that we've seen from Kow and other speculation in the community.",62,,
575,0.97,3703.232,3712.041,"These dots start to connect a pattern, where during this time period, we're just hearing an awful lot of people in the high command didn't know about things.",62,,
576,0.97,3712.041,3718.781,And people in the middle management command level were making big decisions that had big impacts.,62,,
577,0.97,3718.781,3719.182,And nobody knew.,62,,
578,0.97,3719.182,3729.058,And I guess my concern is at what point should people have known and are there consequences for people not making themselves aware of these things that were happening.,62,,
579,0.97,3729.058,3737.033,If they are in a position of that level of authority and command over the police service.,62,,
580,0.97,3737.033,3740.002,Certainly it's a concern.,63,,
581,0.97,3740.002,3743.139,We articulated that same concern about the East precinct case.,63,,
582,0.97,3743.139,3759.655,"I mean, the fact that there was this confusion or this disagreement between folks about who knew what and when and a failure to communicate out to community and media, public officials and others immediately afterwards, when they knew what had occurred was a problem.",63,,
583,0.97,3759.655,3779.575,"I think we had flagged this issue and other cases and in our August 2020 report that went out to the Council that there appeared to be this Disconnect between command staff, like high level command staff and middle supervisors, like lieutenants and captains, how it would be done.",63,,
584,0.97,3779.575,3780.61,It certainly was chaotic.,63,,
585,0.97,3780.61,3789.018,"But yes, I would expect what you do as well, there would be more coordination, communication, and understanding by high level command staff what was going on under them.",63,,
586,0.97,3789.018,3791.687,It's a problem that didn't occur.,63,,
587,0.97,3791.687,3801.03,"You know, when you say, so you said it, at least I think three times today, director Myerberg, that this operation was organized by chain of command.",64,,
588,0.97,3801.03,3801.33,Uh-huh.,65,,
589,0.97,3801.33,3801.631,Right?,66,,
590,0.97,3801.631,3811.874,"When I hear organized by chain of command, it sounds like that chain is starting with captain Grannon, which seems far down the chain of command.",66,,
591,0.97,3811.874,3816.479,"Is that, when you are saying that in your presentation, is that what you mean?",66,,
592,0.97,3816.479,3817.98,That's what I mean.,67,,
593,0.97,3817.98,3825.121,"Yeah, the chain of command is what I mean.",67,,
594,0.97,3825.121,3825.588,Captain Grannon now.,67,,
595,0.97,3825.588,3830.726,I have no information it was organized by anyone else.,67,,
596,0.97,3830.726,3833.496,Promoted to an assistant chief.,67,,
597,0.97,3833.496,3837.133,He was in a supervisory position over Spoc.,67,,
598,0.97,3837.133,3849.011,"Very much the case that because of what was going on and all the moving parts that were happening, people in the captain's role received high level assignments just like this.",67,,
599,0.97,3849.011,3857.687,"On that day, who would have been above Grannon in the chain of command?",68,,
600,0.97,3857.687,3860.489,It depends.,69,,
601,0.97,3860.489,3864.093,It could have been assistant chief Spurjack.,69,,
602,0.97,3864.093,3865.728,It could have been assistant chief.,69,,
603,0.97,3865.728,3869.865,I'm not sure who was heading that Bureau.,69,,
604,0.97,3869.865,3874.904,"Again, assistant chief was running patrol Operatins, which didn't fall under.",69,,
605,0.97,3874.904,3878.174,"So there's a lot of, again, confusion.",69,,
606,0.97,3878.174,3880.443,There's people doing a multitude of different things.,69,,
607,0.97,3880.443,3889.485,"Again, it's not necessarily that clear as to who would have reported to, or if he would have reported to anyone.",69,,
608,0.97,3889.485,3893.756,That could be part of the problem.,69,,
609,0.97,3893.756,3898.06,"Sorry, council member, just real quick and I'll wrap up.",70,,
610,0.97,3898.06,3902.531,"If this gets reopened, maybe we establish what the entire chain of command was.",70,,
611,0.97,3902.531,3914.443,"The sense I just get is that when we're saying chain of command, it sounds like this is starting from the middle of the chain of command and going down.",70,,
612,0.97,3914.443,3919.649,That's an important issue mapping for this in terms of determining who should have known.,70,,
613,0.97,3919.649,3924.887,Like we know who did know and we have representations of people saying they didn't know.,70,,
614,0.97,3924.887,3933.262,"I guess my question is, who should have known and what the implication is going forward for how these kinds of things are organized.",70,,
615,0.97,3933.262,3952.648,"One last implication to that is I think interim chief Diaz has set a precedent for should have knowing in terms of how that factors into discipline, because with the pink umbrella incident.",70,,
616,0.97,3952.648,3965.227,But my understanding is the premise of assistant chief Demotion was assistant chief should have known Lieutenant Brooks was going to Unconstitutionally tear gas a bunch of people.,70,,
617,0.97,3965.227,3967.663,And should have intervened.,70,,
618,0.97,3967.663,3969.332,And didn't.,70,,
619,0.97,3969.332,3970.566,"Therefore, assistant chief was demoted.",70,,
620,0.97,3970.566,3981.877,"It seems like by that standard of chain of command that is being applied, there should be more that is happening with how this ruse is dealt with to be consistent.",70,,
621,0.97,3981.877,3989.452,Which is why I'm focusing on the chain of command and how that is relevant to this fact pattern.,70,,
622,0.97,3989.452,3999.695,"It just seems like, you know, I am tired of being in a position where I'm reading in the news about the latest thing that comes out of 2020.",70,,
623,0.97,3999.695,4007.236,"Everyone that is above, you know, that was in the Mayor's office, or the front office of SPD claims they didn't know about it.",70,,
624,0.97,4007.236,4012.842,And some guy in the middle gets hit with everything and all the responsibility.,70,,
625,0.97,4012.842,4024.62,"And you know, I just don't know if that is an effective way to run an organization or to center accountability and responsibility for the actions of the Department.",70,,
626,0.97,4024.62,4025.988,I'm not sure.,71,,
627,0.97,4025.988,4029.992,"Again, I'm not sure, you know, exactly how to respond.",71,,
628,0.97,4029.992,4036.399,What I will say is the captain is obviously one level behind an assistant chief.,71,,
629,0.97,4036.399,4038.601,There's no deputy chief in the Seattle police Department.,71,,
630,0.97,4038.601,4043.072,That's one tier below an assistant chief.,71,,
631,0.97,4043.072,4046.609,The captain is fairly high up the chain of command.,71,,
632,0.97,4046.609,4061.59,"There are a number of cases in which actions are engaged in by again, even if it is high level commanders, where the very top of the chain of command said they didn't have awareness of the case and that is a concern.",71,,
633,0.97,4061.59,4066.162,And one that I'm hoping that interim chief Diaz will rectify.,71,,
634,0.97,4066.162,4066.495,Thank you.,72,,
635,0.97,4066.495,4069.498,I want to give other folks an opportunity to ask questions.,72,,
636,0.97,4069.498,4073.803,We are going to have to wrap up in five minutes.,72,,
637,0.97,4073.803,4089.518,"I appreciate the line of questioning Council member Lewis; I have been frustrated by the number of we didn't knows, that have come out in this investigation and others.",72,,
638,0.97,4089.518,4098.794,Just looking for a hand from Council members.,72,,
639,0.97,4098.794,4100.629,"Council member Nelson, yes.",72,,
640,0.97,4100.629,4104.233,I did see Council member Pedersen had his hand up.,73,,
641,0.97,4104.233,4109.705,I did not see that.,74,,
642,0.97,4109.705,4109.939,Sorry.,74,,
643,0.97,4109.939,4110.473,Council member Pedersen.,74,,
644,0.97,4110.473,4111.874,Thank you chair Herbold.,75,,
645,0.97,4111.874,4116.011,I concur with the line of questioning that Council member Lewis asks.,75,,
646,0.97,4116.011,4125.988,"Rather than repeat that, I'll look forward to hearing what.",75,,
647,0.97,4125.988,4134.997,-- we are looking forward to seeing the new administration provide that level of oversight with the police Department that is necessary.,75,,
648,0.97,4134.997,4135.297,Thank you.,75,,
649,0.97,4135.297,4138.134,"Back to you, council member Nelson.",76,,
650,0.97,4138.134,4143.906,Thank you very much for this detailed presentation.,77,,
651,0.97,4143.906,4149.678,I actually also like senior deputy Mayor Harrell learned about this in the Seattle times.,77,,
652,0.97,4149.678,4157.086,So I'm bringing myself up to speed on the process of investigations in SPD.,77,,
653,0.97,4157.086,4161.79,"I have a question about, so when was the investigation done?",77,,
654,0.97,4161.79,4168.564,When did the IG sign off on the investigation?,77,,
655,0.97,4168.564,4183.646,"And then when Dr. Myerberg, did you forward it on for potential action and when did the leadership of SPD know about these allegations and your findings?",77,,
656,0.97,4183.646,4207.836,"Because in Council member Herbold's preview of this session today, she mentioned accountability and also potential consequences, which I run out in 180 days, as I imagine, there is a time LINN when those can be recommended and there were in public comment allegations that there was a purposeful running out of the clock.",77,,
657,0.97,4207.836,4212.541,So that is the time line that I'm interested.,77,,
658,0.97,4212.541,4219.348,When was the investigation certified by the IG and when was it forwarded by you to the powers that be?,77,,
659,0.97,4219.348,4223.152,So the investigation was certified in mid September.,78,,
660,0.97,4223.152,4227.489,So I believe it was September 10 or September 12 is when it was certified.,78,,
661,0.97,4227.489,4235.13,"However, prior to that point, so several months prior to that point, both named employee one and two had retired from the police Department.",78,,
662,0.97,4235.13,4241.87,"So at that point, once they retired, the 180 day deadline stopped moving for them.",78,,
663,0.97,4241.87,4254.416,So there is no 180 day deadline because there is no.,78,,
664,0.97,4254.416,4260.322,"The Dcm was finished in late December, which transmitted to the chain of command.",78,,
665,0.97,4260.322,4265.594,And disciplinary proceedings that were held this week.,78,,
666,0.97,4265.594,4267.262,The beginnings of the disciplinary proceedings.,78,,
667,0.97,4267.262,4270.065,"Okay, there was a gap between September and December.",79,,
668,0.97,4270.065,4274.937,"Now all of a sudden, it's a new administration's--okay.",79,,
669,0.97,4274.937,4280.142,"So, it is the same, I guess it's the same as far as the administration goes.",80,,
670,0.97,4280.142,4291.954,It's the same police Department administration and that interim chief Diaz would have been the same chief that reached disciplinary findings had it been done in September.,80,,
671,0.97,4291.954,4296.258,Both employees resigned from the Department in December.,80,,
672,0.97,4296.258,4297.292,Thank you.,81,,
673,0.97,4297.292,4298.394,Thank you.,82,,
674,0.97,4298.394,4303.766,"Before we go back to Council member Lewis, who I see his hand is up again.",82,,
675,0.97,4303.766,4311.507,Other Council members who haven't asked a question yet?,82,,
676,0.97,4311.507,4312.107,All right.,82,,
677,0.97,4312.107,4316.745,"I have not asked a question, so I'm going to put myself in the Cue here.",82,,
678,0.97,4316.745,4335.664,"I just want to real quickly touch on the employees, I believe it is 3 through 6. the named employees 3 through 6 are all findings that have been identified as allegation removed.",82,,
679,0.97,4335.664,4391.92,"Ad I'm just curious a little bit about first the use of that finding for a claim that it appears in this instance, you are sort of acknowledging that there was a violation, but you are removing the allegation because of relief that above those three employees had responsibility and I'm wondering whether or not it makes more sense to just rule on the facts of the case that there was a violation and then let the question of whether or not discipline for that violation that be a determination of police chief.",82,,
680,0.97,4391.92,4402.231,"The nature of policing, it seems like there are often situations that arise where officers have to use their discretion to address a difficult situation.",82,,
681,0.97,4402.231,4414.643,"So, the question is, you know, are they not expected to make all of their decisions consistent with SPD policy utilizing discretion quote, in proportion to the public safety issue address.",82,,
682,0.97,4414.643,4445.374,"If a decision to reference a group of armed proud boys could be seen to make a volatile situation worse, then why aren't the individual officers being held accountable regardless of the supervision component with a sustained violation, perhaps with a you know, an acknowledgment that there is supervisory work that should have been done that wasn't done and that be considered as part of the decisions around discipline.",82,,
683,0.97,4445.374,4449.645,I'm just very concerned about the use of allegation removed.,82,,
684,0.97,4449.645,4461.056,"Why you are simultaneously, you seem to be saying that this would merit a sustained violation.",82,,
685,0.97,4461.056,4465.06,I definitely see the concern.,83,,
686,0.97,4465.06,4475.304,"Fundamentally, from my perspective at least, is that I think the decision to use the proud boys was a very, very poor decision.",83,,
687,0.97,4475.304,4486.248,"I think fundamentally, what it stems from, is the failure of any supervision over these officer's actions and the fact there was no guidance, no parameters.",83,,
688,0.97,4486.248,4488.984,Nothing told about what they should or shouldn't do.,83,,
689,0.97,4488.984,4496.325,"Virtually, all the officers said they never had to do something similarly Beforement they didn't know what they were doing.",83,,
690,0.97,4496.325,4507.135,"I really view that fundamentally as a command failure and not--and yes, I lay the responsibility for this on the level of command.",83,,
691,0.97,4507.135,4511.607,"Me perhaps, there's a better finding than allegation removed.",83,,
692,0.97,4511.607,4521.416,"I don't think the appropriate finding for these officer, given the lack of any support and being set up to fail that the appropriate finding would be a sustained finding.",83,,
693,0.97,4521.416,4531.693,"I would just really urge your role to be really focused on fact finding of whether or not the violation of policy occurred, which you have done.",84,,
694,0.97,4531.693,4534.329,You determined a violation of policy occurred.,84,,
695,0.97,4534.329,4540.802,"Not just that it was a bad idea or bad judgment, but it was a violation of policy.",84,,
696,0.97,4540.802,4556.318,"And I you know, I support you in whether or not someone should be disciplined for violation of policy, if there's a failure of supervision.",84,,
697,0.97,4556.318,4569.364,I'm concerned this particular set of findings goes with the allegation remove is out of the scope of just a fact finding of whether or not the violation occurred.,84,,
698,0.97,4569.364,4571.733,"Council member Lewis, do you want to wrap us up?",84,,
699,0.97,4571.733,4579.775,"Yes, this is just a really brief investigation question.",85,,
700,0.97,4579.775,4593.655,"But director Myerberg, in doing the first round of the investigation, if this gets looked at again, was there any information that OPA wanted to receive and they weren't able to that would have been helpful to make these conclusions?",85,,
701,0.97,4593.655,4607.669,"I think the fact that it's been well publicized, a lot of relevant text message are missing from the police Department and other executive departments.",85,,
702,0.97,4607.669,4617.212,I just wonder if there were issues that would help to get to the bottom of this that Youen countered and that's an area we should look into?,85,,
703,0.97,4617.212,4623.285,"As far as I'm aware, there were no Evidentiary issue that we have was the lack of any evidence.",86,,
704,0.97,4623.285,4628.69,Meaning the lack of any sort of documentation of what occurred and why it occurred.,86,,
705,0.97,4628.69,4633.028,We did E-mail searches and other searches and no response of information came back.,86,,
706,0.97,4633.028,4637.265,That's not a surprise given the nature of the effort.,86,,
707,0.97,4637.265,4641.403,"You know, certainly, we could do a text message search.",86,,
708,0.97,4641.403,4646.775,I know text messages have been collected and collect as part of other litigation.,86,,
709,0.97,4646.775,4660.522,"Is not something that we were necessarily at the time, there was no evidence that we saw that we didn't have aside from a lack of documentation around the ruse.",86,,
710,0.97,4660.522,4668.163,Thank you director Myerberg.,87,,
711,0.97,4668.163,4671.299,"Despite my efforts to keep us on time, this ran over.",87,,
712,0.97,4671.299,4680.008,"There's a great amount of interest, I really thank everybody for being here with us today.",87,,
713,0.97,4680.008,4701.763,"I will certainly forward on questions that Council members may have that didn't get asked and answered and will offer to collect them on behalf of my colleagues to share them with director Myerberg and chief Diaz as we move on, and as appropriate, the office of the inspector general and the CPC.",87,,
714,0.97,4701.763,4714.142,"I know as I mentioned earlier, there's questions about how Oig determines sufficiency of the investigation and I have received some additional information from the Oig about that.",87,,
715,0.97,4714.142,4714.576,I will also share.,87,,
716,0.97,4714.576,4718.08,"With that, let's move on to the next item on the agenda.",87,,
717,0.97,4718.08,4731.793,"Thank you again, everybody, for being with us and a special thanks to senior deputy Harrell for being with us.",87,,
718,0.97,4731.793,4736.731,Can you please read the next item into the agenda?,88,,
719,0.97,4736.731,4738.2,Item number two.,89,,
720,0.97,4738.2,4740.802,Public health update on Covid- 19 briefing and discussion.,89,,
721,0.97,4740.802,4742.771,Thank you so much.,90,,
722,0.97,4742.771,4750.746,Let's start with a quick round of introductions of Presenters here with us today.,90,,
723,0.97,4750.746,4754.249,"Hi, I think I'm the only presenter today.",91,,
724,0.97,4754.249,4757.419,So nice to see you all again.,91,,
725,0.97,4757.419,4761.79,And thank you for the invite.,91,,
726,0.97,4761.79,4763.091,I'm Dennis Worsham.,91,,
727,0.97,4763.091,4768.83,I'm the interim direct Forfor public health of Seattle and King County.,91,,
728,0.97,4768.83,4770.432,Where we're at with Covid.,91,,
729,0.97,4770.432,4772.234,Thank you so much.,92,,
730,0.97,4772.234,4779.341,"Why don't you just take it away and if we have questions, we'll let you know what they are.",92,,
731,0.97,4779.341,4779.641,Thank you.,92,,
732,0.97,4779.641,4785.08,I'm all right to share my screen.,93,,
733,0.97,4785.08,4792.921,I will go there now.,93,,
734,0.97,4792.921,4798.493,And so can you see the screen from your--great.,93,,
735,0.97,4798.493,4802.998,"We can, thank you.",94,,
736,0.97,4802.998,4803.632,I'm Dennis Worsham.,95,,
737,0.97,4803.632,4807.802,And have been in my current role for about seven months now.,95,,
738,0.97,4807.802,4814.81,Prior to that was the director for infectious diseases and heavily involved in our Covid response.,95,,
739,0.97,4814.81,4823.919,"Of course, this is not the news I want to be bringing and I think we're feeling this across the city and county and really across the country and globe at this point.",95,,
740,0.97,4823.919,4841.203,"You know, after a couple years of a pandemic and really our response of hard work from all of us, both in public health, for all of you in the elected and what you are doing and our community partners.",95,,
741,0.97,4841.203,4849.477,"People are fatigued, but are rising to the occasion of what we need to do with our current surge in place.",95,,
742,0.97,4849.477,4853.248,I just want to go over some data slides with you.,95,,
743,0.97,4853.248,4858.22,I think these are always good and painting a picture of where we're at.,95,,
744,0.97,4858.22,4873.335,"To date, here in King County, we have had 248,755 positive cases of Covid.",95,,
745,0.97,4873.335,4877.839,"9,950 hospitalizations, 2,196 deaths.",95,,
746,0.97,4877.839,4881.509,"So, it is really taken a toll on our community all the way around.",95,,
747,0.97,4881.509,4888.884,"We have good news in here, but we also have some challenging news of where we're at.",95,,
748,0.97,4888.884,4905.734,"So in the current surge that all of you have been reading about and know about already, about Omicron, is a variant of concern that was detected in Africa about a month ago.",95,,
749,0.97,4905.734,4908.803,And remarkable how it has taken over.,95,,
750,0.97,4908.803,4917.412,"Our Udub colleagues who do a lot of modeling, 90% of our local Covid cases now are coming from Omicron variant here.",95,,
751,0.97,4917.412,4921.116,So it has come in strong.,95,,
752,0.97,4921.116,4925.854,"We had Delta before that, that was difficult.",95,,
753,0.97,4925.854,4934.162,Omicron is carrying it much more Transmissability and higher impacts of disease in our community.,95,,
754,0.97,4934.162,4948.944,"For our seven-day average that we put in these markers here in the screen in front of you, we are now at this incredible high seven-day daily average of 4,614 cases per day.",95,,
755,0.97,4948.944,4955.717,"That's four times higher, which was back in November of 2020.",95,,
756,0.97,4955.717,4961.389,Twelve times higher than what we saw in Delta in early December of 2021.,95,,
757,0.97,4961.389,4965.36,"So, huge increases of where we're at currently.",95,,
758,0.97,4965.36,4985.28,"As we know, when we're looking at our data is we're seeing transmission increase among all ages, and in particular, our highest among our 18 to 24-Year- olds followed by 25 to 34 and 5 to 17-Year-Olds in the third ranking of that.",95,,
759,0.97,4985.28,5001.062,"Really, among folks who are younger, probably as you can imagine, higher circulation in our community and some of our lower vaccine rates in those age groups as we are getting up to speed in some of those areas.",95,,
760,0.97,5001.062,5006.334,"Case counts and incident rates, race and Ethnicity groups have also increased.",95,,
761,0.97,5006.334,5011.306,Really high among our Hawaiian Pacific Islander population.,95,,
762,0.97,5011.306,5016.511,"Followed by Hispanic, followed by black and seeing an increase in Asians.",95,,
763,0.97,5016.511,5024.719,"In our white residents, we're seeing a decrease proportion of cases since November of 2021.",95,,
764,0.97,5024.719,5041.536,"Although we are seeing increase of burden of disease here in the city of Seattle, our highest outside of the city with Auburn, Federal way, Renton.",95,,
765,0.97,5041.536,5043.805,Hospitalizations are getting a lot of attention for good reason.,95,,
766,0.97,5043.805,5052.48,"As you can see from this graph, just a huge spike of increased cases here needing to be hospitalized.",95,,
767,0.97,5052.48,5058.92,I know in the language that we have seen in the media and coming it is less severe.,95,,
768,0.97,5058.92,5062.59,But even a little bit of a lot is still a lot.,95,,
769,0.97,5062.59,5067.829,"So in contrast to our tenfold increase in cases, hospitalizations increased by five fold.",95,,
770,0.97,5067.829,5081.409,"So what that means is we are seeing on an average in the Delta variant, about 7 hospitalizations per day and now what we're seeing here with the Omicron is about 52 hospitalizations per day.",95,,
771,0.97,5081.409,5089.584,So about a five fold increase from where we were in December and seeing our hospital admissions.,95,,
772,0.97,5089.584,5093.321,The increase is coming to a real challenge for our hospital systems.,95,,
773,0.97,5093.321,5108.536,"Not only did we have the Delta surge, but we also have an increasing Noncovid hospitalizations and then of course, staffing shortages with our medical teams, some that resigned, some that have quit.",95,,
774,0.97,5108.536,5111.94,Some that have been out because of illness.,95,,
775,0.97,5111.94,5135.597,"And also, the other part that is really taxing our system in particular is only having difficulty discharge patients into other settings because of outbreaks going on in long-term care facilities or a lack of staffing in places to put folks who may not need to be in the hospital, but yet not well enough to be out on their own at this particular time.",95,,
776,0.97,5135.597,5147.242,"So most recent hospitalizations are highest that we're seeing around the Covid cases, are among our 40 to 69-Year-Olds and 70 plus followed by our 20 to 39-Year-Olds.",95,,
777,0.97,5147.242,5155.817,Hospital rates for adults are really increasing with age and remain very low in our youth population as opposed to what we have seen in other jurisdictions.,95,,
778,0.97,5155.817,5163.992,"Good news, when we look at our deaths, there really are no major changes currently that we're seeing in death.",95,,
779,0.97,5163.992,5178.339,"We have been averaging through the Delta variant, 1 to 3 deaths per day and our latest report was about 2. so really unchanged in this particular area where we see deaths.",95,,
780,0.97,5178.339,5180.775,This is an important slide.,95,,
781,0.97,5180.775,5198.092,"If you're a ""New York times"" reader, there was an article this morning that talked about New York and Seattle and really this continues to be another surge of people who really are Unvaccinated.",95,,
782,0.97,5198.092,5201.963,"This is, if I can just Orient you to the graph in front of you.",95,,
783,0.97,5201.963,5208.269,"We look at cases on the left hand side, center is hospitalizations, and then deaths.",95,,
784,0.97,5208.269,5218.212,"Going back into August of 2021 until beginning of January 1, is we can see the blue line represents people who were Unvaccinate.",95,,
785,0.97,5218.212,5224.586,"The gray line represents people who are Vaccinated, and the Orange line is the overall King County number.",95,,
786,0.97,5224.586,5235.33,"Of course, that number is low and tends to follow the gray line is because we're such a highly Vaccinated community.",95,,
787,0.97,5235.33,5255.083,"Clearly illustrates that in all three, our greatest spikes are among those people who are Unvaccinated or Unboosted and although we are seeing in cases increasing in people who are Vaccinated, we're seeing less of those cases needing to be hospitalized or experiencing death.",95,,
788,0.97,5255.083,5268.496,It's an important visual to remind us and also to remind us that this is where our greatest work is and our greatest tool in preventing severe illness and death is about getting the importance of vaccines.,95,,
789,0.97,5268.496,5285.013,"We know that right now, not only are vaccines are good tool in this particular area, but we also have other tools in this Multistrategy is really critical, about indoor spaces, avoiding crowded and poorly ventilated areas for folks.",95,,
790,0.97,5285.013,5291.719,"Well fitted masks, this is a message we are trying to really get out into the community.",95,,
791,0.97,5291.719,5296.357,Any help you can do with this is much appreciated.,95,,
792,0.97,5296.357,5307.735,Really having well fitted masks or respirators are really key and we're distributing as many as we can into the community.,95,,
793,0.97,5307.735,5311.873,People can use double masks or double surgical masks.,95,,
794,0.97,5311.873,5315.71,Well fitting masks are critical in this particular outbreak.,95,,
795,0.97,5315.71,5322.55,"The next slide, I want to share with you is just, you know, kind of the general pieces of this.",95,,
796,0.97,5322.55,5330.425,"You know, a few things about Omicron that are unique and challenging in different ways that I want to highlight here.",95,,
797,0.97,5330.425,5333.995,"As I mentioned, our colleagues do a lot of the modeling.",95,,
798,0.97,5333.995,5338.9,90% of our transmission right now is of the Omicron variant.,95,,
799,0.97,5338.9,5365.159,"It is predicted looking at what we have seen in other countries and what we're seeing on the East Coast is we're hoping is true for us, we would anticipate by mid to late you t will vary on things that are unique to our own community that we're watching very closely.",95,,
800,0.97,5365.159,5366.928,The age distributions are different.,95,,
801,0.97,5366.928,5368.229,Underlying health conditions in our population.,95,,
802,0.97,5368.229,5373.034,"Of course, we have some of the highest vaccine coverage in the country.",95,,
803,0.97,5373.034,5390.818,"We have--looking at past infection rates, the time of season that this is hitting us and kind of how our community ADJUSTS or doesn't adjust to social mixing and behaviors around distancing all will determine when the peak will happen and with when we begin to come down.",95,,
804,0.97,5390.818,5398.993,Things are likely going to be a bit more difficult before they get before when we get to the peak and start coming down.,95,,
805,0.97,5398.993,5421.349,"We plan, as part of this because of the burden of disease that's so high and there will be large numbers of people becoming ill in a short time, which will be resulting and we're starting to see absenteeism in work places and staffing will be a challenge for that.",95,,
806,0.97,5421.349,5425.553,We should anticipate that those things will continue to make a challenge for us.,95,,
807,0.97,5425.553,5442.837,"I heard it said, and it's worth repeating, although Omicron may be milder for individuals, it's not as mild on the communities as it has the impacts on the hospital systems and work forces as they will be impacted in this work.",95,,
808,0.97,5442.837,5454.849,I think one of the things we continue to raise here as our success here in Seattle and in the King County area is our vaccine rates are just outstanding.,95,,
809,0.97,5454.849,5463.791,"For five and older, as you can see from the graph, we are over 80% of people who have completed their vaccines.",95,,
810,0.97,5463.791,5468.496,And now almost at 90% of people who received their first dose.,95,,
811,0.97,5468.496,5474.368,This is really a huge Testament to the protection that we have going in our community.,95,,
812,0.97,5474.368,5474.802,So good data points.,95,,
813,0.97,5474.802,5486.214,"And then on the right hand side, you see the maps of King County as those are distributed where our protection rates come into play.",95,,
814,0.97,5486.214,5493.888,"A reminder for folks, it's important for folks to get their boosters when they're eligible for boosters.",95,,
815,0.97,5493.888,5503.497,"And in our County, we have done over 800,000 booster shots or third doses have been administered.",95,,
816,0.97,5503.497,5505.032,We are pushing that number more.,95,,
817,0.97,5505.032,5505.833,The demand is high.,95,,
818,0.97,5505.833,5520.448,And trying to meet the demand in a variety of ways of increasing access points and using a variety of Modalities.,95,,
819,0.97,5520.448,5524.185,People are eligible to get appointments scheduled.,95,,
820,0.97,5524.185,5528.155,We're getting more capacity in the community and having inroads of success.,95,,
821,0.97,5528.155,5536.23,So the message I want to get out to folks is it is important to continue to see people getting Vaccinated.,95,,
822,0.97,5536.23,5537.098,If you're not Vaccinated.,95,,
823,0.97,5537.098,5540.067,And get boosted when you're eligible to be boosted.,95,,
824,0.97,5540.067,5544.772,And getting our colleagues and our community members and family and friends to follow that piece.,95,,
825,0.97,5544.772,5552.613,"If you need to find a place of where to get Vaccinated, go to the King County Covid vaccine site.",95,,
826,0.97,5552.613,5555.583,It will help direct people to those particular areas.,95,,
827,0.97,5555.583,5566.694,"One piece I want to share here, I know that a lot of--I have heard from a few of you, as well as other Electeds that testing has been a challenge.",95,,
828,0.97,5566.694,5570.698,And we know that that is the case.,95,,
829,0.97,5570.698,5575.836,"When you have seen this Ten-Fold increase of disease in the community, that means exposures are high.",95,,
830,0.97,5575.836,5580.608,And it's driving the demand on our testing areas.,95,,
831,0.97,5580.608,5585.346,And we are doing everything we can to meet that demand as best we can.,95,,
832,0.97,5585.346,5589.35,We have worked with the Federal Government to help bring in some sites.,95,,
833,0.97,5589.35,5596.891,"And to offset, we have ordered a number of rapid test kits to get into the community.",95,,
834,0.97,5596.891,5600.728,You have heard the governor make that announcement.,95,,
835,0.97,5600.728,5603.464,Not all of those have arrived yet.,95,,
836,0.97,5603.464,5607.969,"And when they do, we'll get those distributed to the community.",95,,
837,0.97,5607.969,5621.482,"Part of our challenge also was during the winter cold weather snap that we had around the holidays, we had a reduced capacity at the sites because of weather.",95,,
838,0.97,5621.482,5632.56,And also staffing challenges as we are seeing the surge of Omicron having an impact on our own work force to show up and provide the work that is needed.,95,,
839,0.97,5632.56,5635.463,There are tough pinch points in tests.,95,,
840,0.97,5635.463,5636.43,But it is getting better.,95,,
841,0.97,5636.43,5640.768,"At the county, we have purchased over 700,000 tests.",95,,
842,0.97,5640.768,5649.076,"And our goal is to get 100,000 tests distributed into the community as quickly as we can.",95,,
843,0.97,5649.076,5664.625,"We're Prioritizing the initial tests into our high-risk settings where we need to around the long-term care facilities, adult family homes, the emergency medical services, health care facilities.",95,,
844,0.97,5664.625,5676.47,"They are needing help in testing their own staff and residents in these congregate settings, including Correctional facilities.",95,,
845,0.97,5676.47,5683.177,The outbreaks continue to increase at high numbers and concerning for us of our most vulnerable folks.,95,,
846,0.97,5683.177,5697.324,"We're Prioritizing our test kits to those areas and getting them out to the broader community, community centers, and Community-Based organizations as we get the tests in.",95,,
847,0.97,5697.324,5705.9,"Once it's the Spigot analogy, we'll have a better flow from the Federal partners and from the state and what we're purchasing here locally.",95,,
848,0.97,5705.9,5708.969,I do anticipate this will get better over the next week.,95,,
849,0.97,5708.969,5712.64,And we'll make some progress here in where we go.,95,,
850,0.97,5712.64,5719.113,I know some questions have come up around testing for schools.,95,,
851,0.97,5719.113,5728.022,The Department of health has that responsibility and is doing a good job in meeting that demand and working directly with schools for their own testing programs.,95,,
852,0.97,5728.022,5737.231,"As you know, we have a high commitment of keeping In-Person learning as best we can for our students.",95,,
853,0.97,5737.231,5741.368,"In the next slide here, in my closing comments, it's more of the same.",95,,
854,0.97,5741.368,5747.742,We have a lot of protective factors that are going well for us in this community.,95,,
855,0.97,5747.742,5749.91,We have got the right policies in place.,95,,
856,0.97,5749.91,5753.547,We are requiring masks to be worn in indoor areas.,95,,
857,0.97,5753.547,5765.593,We need to get people to enforce that and make sure that we're meeting those things that are already in place.,95,,
858,0.97,5765.593,5769.463,We of course have vaccine mandates Verifications in places where people are gathering in indoor places.,95,,
859,0.97,5769.463,5790.117,"And we are, of course, reiterating these messages as hard as we can as get Vaccinated, get boosted now at five months after your initial booster for one of the Mrnas or two months after in Johnson & amp; Johnson if eligible.",95,,
860,0.97,5790.117,5791.485,"Wear a high-quality, Good-Fitting mask.",95,,
861,0.97,5791.485,5797.525,We're learning more and more in the science around indoor ventilation and air quality.,95,,
862,0.97,5797.525,5799.36,It's critically important.,95,,
863,0.97,5799.36,5805.466,"And if people are needing to gather in those spaces, getting good Ventilation in is really critical.",95,,
864,0.97,5805.466,5815.976,"And at this time, you know, asking people to take as much of a break as they can around crowding in indoor places and keeping the social distancing.",95,,
865,0.97,5815.976,5822.85,All the same messages given and are critically important as we move forward.,95,,
866,0.97,5822.85,5828.789,So I will stop there and happy to answer any questions.,95,,
867,0.97,5828.789,5833.36,Around where we're at and what we are anticipating in the next little bit here.,95,,
868,0.97,5833.661,5833.928,.,95,,
869,0.97,5837.464,5838.732,Thank you so much.,96,,
870,0.97,5838.732,5840.868,I really appreciate you taking some time to be here.,96,,
871,0.97,5840.868,5844.872,Do you have a couple more minutes?,96,,
872,0.97,5844.872,5845.84,I know you're pressed for time.,96,,
873,0.97,5845.84,5846.173,Of course.,97,,
874,0.97,5846.173,5848.776,I would love to help answer any questions.,97,,
875,0.97,5848.776,5851.278,"If we can't, we'll get you back the right answers.",97,,
876,0.97,5851.278,5855.115,And happy to follow up by Email if needed.,97,,
877,0.97,5855.115,5857.084,Thank you so much.,98,,
878,0.97,5857.084,5865.492,"If folks can--in the panel by virtually raising your hand, that helps me see whether or not you have a question.",98,,
879,0.97,5865.492,5867.795,I have two quick questions.,98,,
880,0.97,5867.795,5872.266,One related to the hospital--the rise in hospitalizations.,98,,
881,0.97,5872.266,5882.643,And I know there has been a call to action related to the rise in hospitalizations from the Washington state Medical Association.,98,,
882,0.97,5882.643,5885.946,Just wondering if you could speak to what you have seen.,98,,
883,0.97,5885.946,5896.624,"We have seen the data on the increase in hospitalizations, but what do you know about the impact of that increase on hospital capacity locally?",98,,
884,0.97,5896.624,5906.433,"And then Secondly, just really appreciate you recognizing the difficulties around testing.",98,,
885,0.97,5906.433,5911.972,And I appreciate the availability of tests made throughout the county.,98,,
886,0.97,5911.972,5916.61,And I appreciate the need to focus on vulnerable communities.,98,,
887,0.97,5916.61,5923.884,But what's your advice to folks right now who need a test and are unable to find one?,98,,
888,0.97,5923.884,5925.085,.,98,,
889,0.97,5925.085,5925.319,Yeah.,99,,
890,0.97,5925.319,5925.519,Yeah.,99,,
891,0.97,5925.519,5926.02,Lots of good questions.,99,,
892,0.97,5926.02,5928.956,And I'll do my best to answer those.,99,,
893,0.97,5928.956,5931.191,Let's start with hospitalizations.,99,,
894,0.97,5931.191,5941.402,It's probably the most critical I have seen our hospital situation in at least my time here with this Omicron variant being so high.,99,,
895,0.97,5941.402,5944.838,The issue is on several fronts.,99,,
896,0.97,5944.838,5949.576,One of them is the staffing capacity on the front end has been really challenged.,99,,
897,0.97,5949.576,5965.092,"Not only as we have heard, you know, through reporting and other industries, but the great resignation during this time of Covid of people eligible to retire and leaving the field has caused a tough road here.",99,,
898,0.97,5965.092,5977.004,"And now with Omicron in place and the high infection rates being in the thousands every day, we know those numbers we have are Underreported.",99,,
899,0.97,5977.004,5993.053,It's taking a toll on people able to provide care and are becoming infected and we have seen the CDC change their guidelines to five days or other strategies in order to get work force back as quickly as they can into the environments to provide the care that is needed.,99,,
900,0.97,5993.053,5998.292,So the Department of health is working very closely on this issue.,99,,
901,0.97,5998.292,6008.635,And the governor's office with directly with the health care system in order to provide additional capacity and support as they can around staffing areas.,99,,
902,0.97,6008.635,6015.876,The other area that is on the back end of this that is also a challenge is really around difficult to discharge.,99,,
903,0.97,6015.876,6032.292,"And as we look at some folks, whether they are living Unhoused or whether they are elderly and live alone is they are not able to go to a care facility because the care facilities are having outbreaks and can't accept new people.",99,,
904,0.97,6032.292,6034.094,So there's just a pinch point there.,99,,
905,0.97,6034.094,6050.878,"So again, the Department of health is working to stand up some maybe alternative health places where people can be discharged and create more beds to be available.",99,,
906,0.97,6050.878,6051.445,It's a Multi-Prong approach.,99,,
907,0.97,6051.445,6055.783,And not one easy solution to any of them.,99,,
908,0.97,6055.783,6062.756,It's a Multi-Factor in working closely with calls every day to make the improved outcome in the work.,99,,
909,0.97,6062.756,6065.059,That's about the health care system.,99,,
910,0.97,6065.059,6074.401,"Regarding testing, we're going to be putting out a Blog today, and we're happy to send that if you want to send that out to other folks.",99,,
911,0.97,6074.401,6078.372,"If you can't get a test, find a place to be tested.",99,,
912,0.97,6078.372,6083.01,But that capacity is starting to open up a bit more.,99,,
913,0.97,6083.01,6090.417,"If you have been exposed, isolate and quarantine yourself and not put you're out there until you get a test.",99,,
914,0.97,6090.417,6092.619,Give it a few days.,99,,
915,0.97,6092.619,6093.72,"If symptoms occur, don't circulate.",99,,
916,0.97,6093.72,6101.295,"And of course, you know, just the protective factors you can do in not spreading the virus until you can get a test.",99,,
917,0.97,6101.295,6105.933,"But again, I think that's going to change in the next week in particular.",99,,
918,0.97,6105.933,6110.904,And we're going to be sending out the messages about what folks can do in the short run.,99,,
919,0.97,6111.038,6111.605,Thank you so much.,100,,
920,0.97,6111.605,6113.073,Really appreciate it.,100,,
921,0.97,6113.073,6130.791,"Other Councilmembers, do you have questions for director WOR Tham war Kshama?",100,,
922,0.97,6130.791,6133.794,I'm not seeing additional raised hands.,100,,
923,0.97,6133.794,6144.438,Thank you for all that everybody at Seattle King County public health are doing now and over the last nearly two years now.,100,,
924,0.97,6144.438,6144.938,Really appreciate it.,100,,
925,0.97,6144.938,6147.674,Appreciate you making the extra time today.,100,,
926,0.97,6147.674,6162.489,And our hearts and thoughts are with you as you do this really important and difficult work at a time where I know people are really stressed out and burnt out.,100,,
927,0.97,6162.489,6164.625,But never rising to the occasion.,100,,
928,0.97,6164.625,6164.892,Thank you.,100,,

933,0.97,6172.199,6173.8,We appreciate the partnership.,101,,

962,0.97,6295.188,6295.956,I'm seeing it.,112,,
963,0.97,6295.956,6296.123,Yes.,112,,
964,0.97,6296.123,6296.923,If we could psychological up.,112,,
965,0.97,6296.923,6308.735,"On the first slide to report here, we have reported to Council last year and Council has been monitoring some of the staffing challenges that we have had.",112,,
966,0.97,6308.735,6312.172,This is--we continue to be significantly Understaffed.,112,,
967,0.97,6312.172,6321.314,"This is actually not just a city of Seattle challenge, but it's also the other 911 centers throughout the region.",112,,
968,0.97,6321.314,6322.849,And actually a nationwide issue.,112,,
969,0.97,6322.849,6330.09,We had been even with that aggressively trying to hire and fill some of our spots.,112,,
970,0.97,6330.09,6331.158,Doing lots of recruiting.,112,,
971,0.97,6331.158,6337.297,"Unfortunately, the vaccine mandate, for all of its benefits, still set us back about six to eight months.",112,,
972,0.97,6337.297,6341.301,We lost approximately 10% of the work force due to the vaccine mandates.,112,,
973,0.97,6341.301,6341.768,That started us over.,112,,
974,0.97,6341.768,6345.172,I have circled some of the numbers.,112,,
975,0.97,6345.172,6349.176,"The communications dispatcher number one, that's our 911 call takers.",112,,
976,0.97,6349.176,6354.181,You can see we are at less than half of the allocated staffing there.,112,,
977,0.97,6354.181,6358.485,That's where we are struggling the most with 911 calls.,112,,
978,0.97,6358.485,6364.758,We have a lot of the dispatcher 2S and 3S that will step in and try to answer the calls.,112,,
979,0.97,6364.758,6375.469,And this gets to the issue we have reported previously on the Nonemergency or the SPD business line being shut down or shuttered during different times of the day.,112,,
980,0.97,6375.469,6378.939,And I'll report more on that in a little bit.,112,,
981,0.97,6378.939,6382.943,Our total numbers for 2021 you can see circled in red at the bottom.,112,,
982,0.97,6382.943,6385.645,"We lost a record number of people, 33 people.",112,,
983,0.97,6385.645,6391.385,"And again, this is due to the Covid vaccine mandate.",112,,
984,0.97,6391.385,6392.419,This is stress.,112,,
985,0.97,6392.419,6398.125,This is spillover from some of the protesting and Whatnot from the previous year.,112,,
986,0.97,6398.125,6402.162,"We were able to hire almost a record number of people as well, the 23.",112,,
987,0.97,6402.162,6406.7,That was a net change of a loss of 10 people.,112,,
988,0.97,6406.7,6412.506,"The good news, we did just start yet another class just this last Friday of six people.",112,,
989,0.97,6412.506,6421.515,We have been doing classes about every month and a half to try to get those people hired and trained into the positions.,112,,
990,0.97,6421.515,6426.92,We continue our--we are continuing to try to hire our back office support staff.,112,,
991,0.97,6426.92,6436.93,"This is one of the things that has been helping--I'm sorry, hurting our recruiting potential is that we are not yet fully staffed out as a department.",112,,
992,0.97,6436.93,6445.172,"We, like other city departments, are struggling to hire hr positions, finances positions, and many more.",112,,
993,0.97,6445.172,6449.643,The city has many of the vacant positions posted.,112,,
994,0.97,6449.643,6455.682,"Like so many industries, a lot of people are not applying for jobs right now.",112,,
995,0.97,6455.682,6456.116,"Next slide, please.",112,,
996,0.97,6456.116,6473.066,"One of the things that I wanted to report back to Council, I know at the end of the year, there was a lot of questions from you as far as the impact of the previous administration's hiring incentives.",112,,
997,0.97,6473.066,6481.208,"As a reminder, those incentives for $10,000 for new hires and up to $25,000 for Laterals.",112,,
998,0.97,6481.208,6484.411,We did see about a Five-Foeld increase over the previous years.,112,,
999,0.97,6484.411,6485.045,This is good.,112,,
1000,0.97,6485.045,6491.985,This helped the numbers look a lot better than they would have otherwise.,112,,
1001,0.97,6491.985,6504.965,"These incentives are the highest in the nation, which was a phenomenal statement as far as the value that Seattle puts into our 911 system and 911 call takers and Dispatchers.",112,,
1002,0.97,6504.965,6517.143,Classroom training typically takes four weeks and is followed by six to seven weeks of training on the floor where people with supervision are taking 911 calls and learning the craft.,112,,
1003,0.97,6517.143,6520.213,So a new hire can take three months to fully vest.,112,,
1004,0.97,6520.213,6525.819,"The numbers you see there since the announcement came out, that's the 393 applications.",112,,
1005,0.97,6525.819,6529.356,That refers to the five-fold increase over the previous years.,112,,
1006,0.97,6529.356,6529.789,"Next slide, please.",112,,
1007,0.97,6529.789,6536.096,Just some numbers on where we are with the 911 answering.,112,,
1008,0.97,6536.096,6536.696,"Again, I mentioned it.",112,,
1009,0.97,6536.696,6541.368,We have been struggling with the lack of numbers here.,112,,
1010,0.97,6541.368,6550.143,"For the last week, the Statistics here, the standard and our hope is to answer 90% of the 911 calls within 15 seconds.",112,,
1011,0.97,6550.143,6553.013,We were able to meet that pretty close.,112,,
1012,0.97,6553.013,6558.385,You can see the average was about 89.73.,112,,
1013,0.97,6558.385,6563.223,"Even with our staffing crunch, we are just barely under the standard.",112,,
1014,0.97,6563.223,6565.058,"No again, we have taken--.",112,,
1015,0.97,6565.058,6565.358,Round up.,113,,
1016,0.97,6565.492,6567.694,"We have made all kinds--yes, round up.",114,,
1017,0.97,6567.694,6573.867,"You know, the challenge, of course, is that we have taken all kinds of measures to get to that point.",114,,
1018,0.97,6573.867,6590.216,"You know, not answering SPD's business line and taking incredibly long times to answer some of the secondary calls to do that, you know, with the priority being on active ongoing emergencies.",114,,
1019,0.97,6590.216,6605.298,"So the hope is that as we get more people, we can start to round out the better customer service, taking more time to answer people and help them with whatever challenges that have led them to call 911.",114,,
1020,0.97,6605.298,6606.7,"Next slide, please.",114,,
1021,0.97,6606.7,6624.551,"Before we move on, on that, you know, those fractions of a second, you know, obviously, can make a big difference in somebody's health, safety, and calling 911.",115,,
1022,0.97,6624.551,6633.593,So I don't mean to make light of your efforts to meet that national standard.,115,,
1023,0.97,6633.593,6651.978,"As it relates specifically to the efforts to staff up, the 393 applications that you have received since the incentive announcement, have you already gone through that bunch to determine how many are viable applications?",115,,
1024,0.97,6651.978,6681.241,"Just so we can get a sense on how that--I understand that's--the incentives allowed you to increase the number of applications five times, but I think an important metric is to look at whether or not that increase is representative of the applicants as well.",115,,
1025,0.97,6681.241,6681.474,Sure.,116,,
1026,0.97,6681.474,6688.982,If the clerk could go back a couple of slides--there we go.,116,,
1027,0.97,6688.982,6689.282,Right there.,116,,
1028,0.97,6689.282,6693.253,"If you look below the circled ones, you see a math game.",116,,
1029,0.97,6693.253,6701.027,The more people applying and we lose a certain percentage to the testing process and the interviews and so on and so forth.,116,,
1030,0.97,6701.027,6705.432,What you see below there are the different steps in the process.,116,,
1031,0.97,6705.432,6710.27,Only 22 of the 393 are folks that you selected for interviews?,117,,
1032,0.97,6710.27,6712.372,Just for this period right here.,118,,
1033,0.97,6712.372,6714.808,So it's kind of an ongoing process.,118,,
1034,0.97,6714.808,6719.145,We switched so that our application process isn't like in windows now.,118,,
1035,0.97,6719.145,6719.579,It's just ongoing.,118,,
1036,0.97,6719.579,6722.716,"As they come in, we push them to the testing process.",118,,
1037,0.97,6722.716,6730.056,"Once they go out of testing, you know, we're doing interviews, background, Psychs.",118,,
1038,0.97,6730.056,6751.111,"Councilmember, if you were to total up the numbers, 22 plus 11 plus 9 plus 7, that gives you a better picture of how many of the 393 are getting pushed through at any given time, given the limitations of how many we can interview in a given time, how many the testing company can do and so on and so forth.",118,,
1039,0.97,6751.111,6752.178,That's super helpful.,119,,
1040,0.97,6752.178,6752.479,Thank you.,119,,
1041,0.97,6752.479,6765.792,And I want to say that I am supportive of a 2022 bonus incentive for city employees.,119,,
1042,0.97,6765.792,6773.466,And I know that the executive is intending to prepare a report on the Council's request.,119,,
1043,0.97,6773.466,6774.1,It's due in March.,119,,
1044,0.97,6774.1,6781.374,"The sooner we get it, I think the sooner we can have these discussions.",119,,
1045,0.97,6781.374,6785.445,The old 2021 incentive bonus program was only for Cscc and the police Department.,119,,
1046,0.97,6785.445,6792.919,Our request is to look at what the needs are city wide.,119,,
1047,0.97,6792.919,6800.927,I don't want to preference the work of one Department--and the importance of workers in one Department over the other.,119,,
1048,0.97,6800.927,6822.782,That's why I'm pleased that the council agreed that we need a city wide analysis of each Department and design an incentive bonus program that serves the great needs of employees in all of our departments and members of the public receiving service from all of these departments.,119,,
1049,0.97,6822.782,6833.56,"I want to state on the record here that the sooner we get that information back from the executive, the sooner we can have that conversation about a 2022 bonus incentive program.",119,,
1050,0.97,6833.693,6837.397,"Thank you, Councilmember.",120,,
1051,0.97,6837.397,6838.298,Okay.,120,,
1052,0.97,6838.298,6841.734,So I made a quick reference on what that means.,120,,
1053,0.97,6841.734,6843.837,"You know, we have been doing everything.",120,,
1054,0.97,6843.837,6849.042,We have been throwing all of our resources at 911.,120,,
1055,0.97,6849.042,6853.213,Here is the down side or the negative impact.,120,,
1056,0.97,6853.213,6864.791,"From the time period listed, we were unable to answer SPD's Nonemergency line 15.6% of the time.",120,,
1057,0.97,6864.791,6873.7,"We're able to answer it in the middle of the night, but there's not a lot of people calling the business line in the middle of the night.",120,,
1058,0.97,6873.7,6885.411,"Distribution curves being what they are, unfortunately, that is quite a few hours during the day that we're not able to answer it because we're putting all of the resources to 911.",120,,
1059,0.97,6885.411,6885.745,It's sporadic.,120,,
1060,0.97,6885.745,6889.315,Some of the outages have been as low as 5 to 15 minutes.,120,,
1061,0.97,6889.315,6891.718,Some of them have been a couple of hours long.,120,,
1062,0.97,6891.718,6897.323,"Again, we are trying to do as much as we can with the people and the resources that we have.",120,,
1063,0.97,6897.323,6897.757,"Next slide, please.",120,,
1064,0.97,6897.89,6907.0,Do people receive an automated message when you're unable to--.,121,,
1065,0.97,6907.0,6907.3,Yes.,122,,
1066,0.97,6907.3,6907.533,.,122,,
1067,0.97,6907.533,6914.073,And do you direct those folks to Online reporting?,123,,
1068,0.97,6914.073,6914.207,.,123,,
1069,0.97,6914.207,6914.44,Yep.,124,,
1070,0.97,6914.44,6914.607,Yep.,124,,
1071,0.97,6914.607,6914.974,Great question.,124,,
1072,0.97,6914.974,6917.81,So the automated Messaging has two parts.,124,,
1073,0.97,6917.81,6924.617,"It has a Messaging that can refer people to other resources, Online reports and Whatnot.",124,,
1074,0.97,6924.617,6931.19,"And eventually, into a press one for, press two for to get them to some other resources.",124,,
1075,0.97,6931.19,6935.929,"So yes, you're correct, it is not just a strictly too bad, so sad.",124,,
1076,0.97,6935.929,6936.162,.,124,,
1077,0.97,6936.162,6936.496,Thank you.,125,,
1078,0.97,6936.496,6939.766,"And for folks listening, what we're talking about is for the Nonemergency line.",125,,
1079,0.97,6939.766,6940.333,.,125,,
1080,0.97,6940.333,6941.334,Correct.,126,,
1081,0.97,6941.334,6950.643,This is another project that Council was very enthusiastic in support for last year.,126,,
1082,0.97,6950.643,6966.092,"This is the dispatch protocol project the effort in this project is to really get a software package that will help the 911 call takers be a lot more consistent in how they are taking, screening, and Resourcing different incoming 911 calls.",126,,
1083,0.97,6966.092,6975.368,"Our hope is that this is working in partnership with the triage one program, mentioned previously as far as Nonpolice resources.",126,,
1084,0.97,6975.368,6982.709,This is also part of trying to improve reducing or diminishing bias in calls.,126,,
1085,0.97,6982.709,6989.215,"And again, just trying to get overall more consistency to help quality assurance, our Metrics, and everything.",126,,
1086,0.97,6989.215,6992.385,The project team had its first operational meeting last week.,126,,
1087,0.97,6992.385,6994.62,The red Star is where we are.,126,,
1088,0.97,6994.62,7006.733,We're getting ready to start with the Rfp process to identify the different vendors in this space and who might have the best fit or best solution for Seattle and what we're looking for.,126,,
1089,0.97,7006.733,7017.243,We hope to be able to finish that up by June of this year and start building and implementing the product in June.,126,,
1090,0.97,7017.243,7020.279,"So again, this is an exciting one.",126,,
1091,0.97,7020.279,7021.481,We're moving forward with this.,126,,
1092,0.97,7021.481,7028.388,"And then, again, hopefully finishing up by the end of the year.",126,,
1093,0.97,7028.521,7042.668,"And I just want to flag here, one, I am a little concerned that the Rfp process is five months.",127,,
1094,0.97,7042.668,7068.227,"I'm concerned that we're just getting started on it, given the fact that when we talked during the Council's deliberations on the biennial budget adjustment, we decided it was not an idea to wait on the deliberations for the 2022 budget.",127,,
1095,0.97,7068.227,7079.338,Cscc would not have the funds available to do the Rfp and develop the Rfp until the beginning of 2022.,127,,
1096,0.97,7079.338,7108.534,"And so the Council's action on getting those dollars for the dispatch protocol project in, I believe, August, early August, Mid-August, before the break was intended to make the delivery of the project happen more quickly than if we had waited until the budget discussions for 2022 that would not be in effect until now.",127,,
1097,0.97,7108.534,7128.187,So I'm wondering if you could speak a little bit to the time line here and how what is proposed might not quite meet our hopes and dreams when we discussed this back in late July and early August?,127,,
1098,0.97,7128.187,7128.855,.,127,,
1099,0.97,7128.855,7129.088,Yeah.,128,,
1100,0.97,7129.088,7129.522,Thank you.,128,,
1101,0.97,7129.522,7131.357,"I share your frustration, Councilmember.",128,,
1102,0.97,7131.357,7139.098,"So what we have been running into is actually, you know, without being too disparaging, city process.",128,,
1103,0.97,7139.098,7147.039,"Because of the size of the project, the funding involved, and the magnitude, it had to be assigned a project manager.",128,,
1104,0.97,7147.039,7151.244,There was a Vetting process to get that that involved other departments.,128,,
1105,0.97,7151.244,7154.447,We had to compete with all of the I.T.,128,,
1106,0.97,7154.447,7155.114,Projects in the city.,128,,
1107,0.97,7155.114,7163.756,"Now, again, Fortunately, we ended up on top because of the public safety nature and the impact that this has on police and on fire and on other departments.",128,,
1108,0.97,7163.756,7168.127,"But we had to go through the process, nonetheless.",128,,
1109,0.97,7168.127,7171.631,So that Chews up a couple of weeks.,128,,
1110,0.97,7171.631,7197.557,"Once they identified the project manager, all of this stuff that you see, again, unfortunately is, again, not trying to DIS on my beloved city here, but it is Bureau Bureau SI in the hoops we have to jump through.",128,,
1111,0.97,7197.557,7212.271,"This is what I have been told, the fast tracking for the process to make sure that we are adhering with our own rules and regulations to have an open and fair process.",128,,
1112,0.97,7212.271,7213.472,If that helps.,128,,
1113,0.97,7213.472,7214.807,"Thank you, director.",129,,
1114,0.97,7214.807,7238.464,And the reason why this protocol project is so important is it allows the Dispatchers to ask a set of questions that will help facilitate the development and implementation of other Nonuniform police responses.,129,,
1115,0.97,7238.464,7244.17,It is an integral part of the infrastructure that needs to be in place before we make policy changes.,129,,
1116,0.97,7244.17,7263.122,"And the policy changes, we have often talked about them as being driven by desire for better outcomes by having people who are better trained and better equipped to respond to certain 911 calls that don't require a uniformed officer.",129,,
1117,0.97,7263.122,7279.705,"Given the fact that we have such a reduced number of police officers now to respond to those high priority 911 calls, there's also a public safety urgency associated with the development of alternatives.",129,,
1118,0.97,7279.705,7286.012,We don't have enough police officers to respond to all the calls that 911 receives.,129,,
1119,0.97,7286.012,7293.352,We want to make sure that officers are not responding to things that they don't need to respond to.,129,,
1120,0.97,7293.352,7301.127,"Not just because we don't want the negative outcomes that sometimes happen, but we want the officers to respond to only the things that they can.",129,,
1121,0.97,7301.127,7305.364,And we don't have enough officers to do that right now.,129,,
1122,0.97,7305.364,7323.449,I just want to emphasize that there's a public safety interest as well as it relates to sort of traditional public safety as opposed to the broader community safety that we're talking about in being able to respond quickly to those calls.,129,,
1123,0.97,7323.449,7323.883,Councilmember Lewis?,129,,
1124,0.97,7324.016,7328.187,"Thank you, Madame chair.",130,,
1125,0.97,7328.187,7332.491,I want to jump in and echo that urgency.,130,,
1126,0.97,7332.491,7343.536,And I really want to applaud director Lombard for working in challenging circumstances to try to emphasize the shared urgency that the Council has for this project.,130,,
1127,0.97,7343.536,7350.91,"I had the great privilege of taking a tour while the director was Unfortunately in Washington, D.C., on a trip.",130,,
1128,0.97,7350.91,7371.363,"So I couldn't join him in person, but a tour of the 911 call center where a lot of the concerns were laid there by the folks working there in terms of wanting the new tools and services, wanting the ability to be more responsive to the calls for service from Seattle residents.",130,,
1129,0.97,7371.363,7376.402,And I do just want to further support chair Herbold's point.,130,,
1130,0.97,7376.402,7386.045,We all are really well aware that there is a bottleneck in police hiring that is going along with the deficit in police officers that we currently have.,130,,
1131,0.97,7386.045,7392.818,The Council for two years in a row has fully funded a police hiring class.,130,,
1132,0.97,7392.818,7397.423,"There's always Atransition as people are coming in, people are going out.",130,,
1133,0.97,7397.423,7402.294,There's higher than usual Atransition over the course of the last two years.,130,,
1134,0.97,7402.294,7411.07,We need to be able to hire some of these other services that can take on certain calls to free up the police to do things only the police can do.,130,,
1135,0.97,7411.07,7431.357,"And just in terms of these sessions being helpful for issues for the incoming administration, I would continue to put a fine point on anything that can be done to fast track the dispatch protocol from the incoming administration is going to be time well spent to respond to the social service and public safety emergency on the street.",130,,
1136,0.97,7431.357,7445.304,"And I want to lift up the efforts of the director and accent wait this is a Council priority on moving these deadlines faster, if possible.",130,,
1137,0.97,7445.304,7445.571,So thank you.,130,,
1138,0.97,7445.871,7448.107,.,130,,
1139,0.97,7449.375,7449.642,Thank you.,131,,
1140,0.97,7449.642,7454.914,So the next slide.,131,,
1141,0.97,7454.914,7460.219,"Based on what both of you were saying, this is one of the alternatives.",131,,
1142,0.97,7460.219,7485.811,"So just a quick Recap as we were coming in to the holiday season at the end of the year, Council had talked and working with Council, we agreed that launching both the protocol and the triage one program simultaneously, that would get things going a lot faster as opposed to doing the protocols and trying to build the triage one system.",131,,
1143,0.97,7485.811,7516.141,"As Council knows in the briefings toward the end of last year, working with the fire Department, using the existing mobile integrated health program to help us build the Cscc resource, we wanted--labor expressed an interest in talking with fire and Cscc as we're building it out to where are the lines between the firefighters and Emts and the patrol officers Úin the health practitioners and Whatnot that might be in the middle program.",131,,
1144,0.97,7516.141,7523.782,"I'm happy to report that last week, we kicked off those meetings right after the new year.",131,,
1145,0.97,7523.782,7544.303,"Had our first meeting with labor to work through the issues and Express, you know, where this is the middle ground that, as we have discussed, that there may or may not be overlap on the spectrum trying to identify, Okay, you know, whose body of work is what?",131,,
1146,0.97,7544.303,7546.238,And where is this neutral zone in between.,131,,
1147,0.97,7546.238,7550.709,I will report more in the future on how the meetings are processing.,131,,
1148,0.97,7550.709,7553.445,And we're looking forward to keep moving this project forward.,131,,
1149,0.97,7553.445,7553.879,"Next slide, please.",131,,
1150,0.97,7553.879,7557.383,All right.,131,,
1151,0.97,7557.383,7559.285,So the outage.,131,,
1152,0.97,7559.285,7564.423,I'll get to this quickly and kind of summarize what happened.,131,,
1153,0.97,7564.423,7571.497,"December 9th, 2021, last year, we had a statewide outage that occurred in the afternoon.",131,,
1154,0.97,7571.497,7592.418,"The company that has what's called the Internet that connects all the 911 centers in the state of Washington and routes all the 911 traffic, the company was doing maintenance on this net throughout the state.",131,,
1155,0.97,7592.418,7598.958,"Normally, there's a couple redundancies built into the system and it's supposed to switch to the B side of this.",131,,
1156,0.97,7598.958,7601.927,"For whatever reason, this did not happen.",131,,
1157,0.97,7601.927,7607.499,We don't know yet why that didn't happen.,131,,
1158,0.97,7607.499,7613.572,Both the state office and King County is investigating and should have feedback on that soon.,131,,
1159,0.97,7613.572,7621.447,What happens when that failure occurs is that 911 lines then get routed to alternatives for every single 911 center.,131,,
1160,0.97,7621.447,7626.318,"In our case, we have a secondary or backup.",131,,
1161,0.97,7626.318,7638.364,"And then our Nonemergency--I'm sorry, not the secondary line, but an alarm company reporting line and the backup line, as we have talked about earlier in this presentation.",131,,
1162,0.97,7638.364,7639.131,Next slide.,131,,
1163,0.97,7639.131,7651.043,"One of the challenges that we found is that when 911 lines start coming in on those, it doesn't present normally with the caller Id.",131,,
1164,0.97,7651.043,7660.986,So there's a little confusion that happens from the call taker's perspective as far as not recognizing it right away as an outage.,131,,
1165,0.97,7660.986,7667.426,The outage only lasted just over an hour.,131,,
1166,0.97,7667.426,7668.627,15:21 to 16:43 hours.,131,,
1167,0.97,7668.627,7673.599,What happened is our folks did quickly realize that those were emergency numbers coming in.,131,,
1168,0.97,7673.599,7680.472,Part of the other aspect of the change that made it difficult to identify is that it wasn't immediate.,131,,
1169,0.97,7680.472,7685.344,We were still getting some lines or some emergencies coming in on 911 as well.,131,,
1170,0.97,7685.344,7695.788,"So once we identified it, our supervisors were able to jump on it, confirm that, in fact, 911 calls were coming through some of the Nonemergency lines.",131,,
1171,0.97,7695.788,7702.194,"Again, this is the business one that we shut on, shut off.",131,,
1172,0.97,7702.194,7719.578,"So the supervisor turned that on and directed all the 911 callers to start answering all those lines with equal priority, regardless of whether it was the business line or a 911 line, knowing that we were getting emergency calls coming in on both.",131,,
1173,0.97,7719.578,7720.012,"Next slide, please.",131,,
1174,0.97,7720.012,7739.798,"Even with the hiccup caused by the failure, for the first part of this event, we did recognize that call volumes actually were present consistent for this hour.",131,,
1175,0.97,7739.798,7743.702,So we don't believe we lost any 911 calls.,131,,
1176,0.97,7743.702,7748.474,"We feel that they came in, they probably just came in on different lines and Whatnot.",131,,
1177,0.97,7748.474,7752.911,"Call volume, at least for the first part of it, was pretty consistent.",131,,
1178,0.97,7752.911,7768.293,"Because we weren't sure of the cause or of the nature, because we suspected that some 911 calls may have been getting dropped, and again in the first moments after this happens, there's a lot of size up and Troubleshooting trying to figure out what happened.",131,,
1179,0.97,7768.293,7773.265,We started coordinating with the fire alarm center and with the emergency operation center.,131,,
1180,0.97,7773.265,7789.948,"So the decision was made to send out an alert Seattle message to those within the city of Seattle that if people were not able to connect to 911, then to call the two backup or the business line numbers.",131,,
1181,0.97,7789.948,7790.916,And only for emergencies.,131,,
1182,0.97,7790.916,7797.489,I have got the actual text of the message sent there.,131,,
1183,0.97,7797.489,7801.193,The public alerts were sent out by SPD's Twitter.,131,,
1184,0.97,7801.193,7803.896,"And again, the office of emergency management in Seattle.",131,,
1185,0.97,7803.896,7810.335,So we identified problems that are being looked into.,131,,
1186,0.97,7810.335,7817.81,"The Wea messages, those are similar to the amber alerts and the silver alerts we get.",131,,
1187,0.97,7817.81,7828.72,"Unfortunately, one of those messages went way beyond just the city of Seattle or those in Seattle that have requested to get alert Seattle messages.",131,,
1188,0.97,7828.72,7830.189,That was part of the problem.,131,,
1189,0.97,7830.189,7850.342,"One of the other parts of the problems is many, many, many of those receiving the message, for whatever reason, whether they didn't read it or misunderstood it, both reasons that were looking at the message content and how to clarify it further, thought that they were supposed to call these numbers.",131,,
1190,0.97,7850.342,7867.726,"So because of these combinations of efforts, a message that people didn't read completely, a message that maybe we need to reform a little bit, and then a message that went way beyond Seattle that we thought, we basically imposed like a self-imposed denial of service.",131,,
1191,0.97,7867.726,7871.663,We saw a huge surge in calls that happened almost right after it happened.,131,,
1192,0.97,7871.663,7873.565,Thank you for the slide there.,131,,
1193,0.97,7873.565,7878.904,What you see there is the big spike went out about a minute after the call.,131,,
1194,0.97,7878.904,7885.344,We went from about two or three calls in the minute before to up to 40.,131,,
1195,0.97,7885.344,7891.35,"Now, each of the lines coming in to Seattle can only handle 40 calls at a time.",131,,
1196,0.97,7891.35,7895.821,That's the number we have coming in to the city.,131,,
1197,0.97,7895.821,7896.955,And then it Busies out.,131,,
1198,0.97,7896.955,7900.626,All of those Maxed in a minute.,131,,
1199,0.97,7900.626,7901.56,The floor was going crazy.,131,,
1200,0.97,7901.56,7903.395,Everybody reported all hands on deck.,131,,
1201,0.97,7903.395,7908.533,"Go ahead and advance to the next slide, please.",131,,
1202,0.97,7908.533,7917.309,"In the following hour after the Messaging went out, we saw a surge of over 1,000 calls to 911.",131,,
1203,0.97,7917.309,7924.917,"Almost all of those were determined to be, again, people calling saying am I supposed to report or supposed to check this number?",131,,
1204,0.97,7924.917,7929.288,Or is there a problem with 911?,131,,
1205,0.97,7929.288,7938.263,"Unfortunately, sounds like we need to do public Messaging as far as don't call 911 if you don't have an emergency.",131,,
1206,0.97,7938.263,7941.6,This was an increase of 1200% over what we normally get.,131,,
1207,0.97,7941.6,7946.805,The normal for that hour during the day is 79 calls.,131,,
1208,0.97,7946.805,7951.81,They recorded the outage was resolved about 16:43 hours.,131,,
1209,0.97,7951.81,7953.545,"Shortly after, the operations began to stabilize.",131,,
1210,0.97,7953.679,7967.859,"I understand the issue where people misread the message that didn't tell them to call, but told them if they had an emergency, this is where you call.",132,,
1211,0.97,7967.859,7982.708,"Can you speak--that's human error and maybe there's the text could have been worded differently or maybe no matter how it was worded, there's going to be a number of people who are going to misinterpret it.",132,,
1212,0.97,7982.708,7999.591,"On the other element where the announcement went out to people outside of the city of Seattle, folks who should not have received the announcement, can you speak to why that happened?",132,,
1213,0.97,7999.591,8000.125,Sure.,133,,
1214,0.97,8000.125,8005.097,There's a certain part of the population that misinterpreted the message.,133,,
1215,0.97,8005.097,8016.775,"When the message went out to a much wider base, it went to South Snohomish County, through King County, over to parts of Kitsap County.",133,,
1216,0.97,8016.775,8018.043,It covered such a large area.,133,,
1217,0.97,8018.043,8027.152,We had people from all of the Non-Seattle regions calling the two numbers listed in the message with the same confusion.,133,,
1218,0.97,8027.152,8028.42,That's my question.,134,,
1219,0.97,8028.42,8032.491,Why did a larger number of people receive the message?,134,,
1220,0.97,8032.491,8042.768,"So the office of emergency management is trying to investigate that and kind of figure out what happened to that, what they call the Wea Messaging.",135,,
1221,0.97,8042.768,8045.203,It was not supposed to do that.,135,,
1222,0.97,8045.203,8049.141,The Forensics of that are ongoing as to why that happened.,135,,
1223,0.97,8049.141,8049.474,Thank you.,136,,
1224,0.97,8049.474,8049.708,Yep.,137,,
1225,0.97,8049.708,8053.512,"So again, the conclusions, I have hit most of those.",137,,
1226,0.97,8053.512,8074.332,"So we have already started working with King County 911 on Messaging since it did hit all the 911 centers in the county that if we do alert Seattle Messaging or something similar in the future, our intent is that King County 911 should take the lead on Messaging.",137,,
1227,0.97,8074.332,8077.002,They refer people to a Website instead of phone numbers.,137,,
1228,0.97,8077.002,8083.208,"And then the Website shows that Hey, if you live in this city, contact this number.",137,,
1229,0.97,8083.208,8087.145,"If you live in this city, contact this number.",137,,
1230,0.97,8087.145,8091.85,We feel that that would significantly improve our response should something like this happen again.,137,,
1231,0.97,8091.85,8102.06,"Again, we don't have specifics yet from the state or the county yet on why the automatic Switchover did not happen.",137,,
1232,0.97,8102.06,8104.596,But we will report those back as soon as we can as well.,137,,
1233,0.97,8104.596,8108.233,"Again, we believe that no 911 calls were lost.",137,,
1234,0.97,8108.233,8113.004,They just came in on different lines and possibly took a little bit longer for us to answer.,137,,
1235,0.97,8113.004,8113.305,Next slide.,137,,
1236,0.97,8113.305,8116.141,All right.,137,,
1237,0.97,8116.141,8123.448,That's the Snapshot for where Cscc is.,137,,
1238,0.97,8123.448,8125.75,And some of our recent activities.,137,,
1239,0.97,8125.884,8127.686,Thank you so much.,138,,
1240,0.97,8127.686,8129.488,Councilmember Nelson?,138,,
1241,0.97,8129.621,8136.795,Yes.,139,,
1242,0.97,8136.795,8137.062,Thank you.,139,,
1243,0.97,8137.062,8142.634,"After I raised my hand, you got to what I was raising my hand for, which is on page 7.",139,,
1244,0.97,8142.634,8145.203,The calls did not get routed to the B side.,139,,
1245,0.97,8145.203,8150.775,But this did not happen and that's the crux of the problem.,139,,
1246,0.97,8150.775,8152.878,So I await those answers.,139,,
1247,0.97,8152.878,8159.651,But my question or my question is a little bit broader than this slide pack.,139,,
1248,0.97,8159.651,8170.328,"My understanding is that King County holds the contract with Comtech, right?",139,,
1249,0.97,8170.328,8175.834,And Seattle is one public safety--I think Psap?,139,,
1250,0.97,8175.834,8177.369,I can't remember what that is.,139,,
1251,0.97,8177.369,8197.556,But what is the city's relationship to the county when it comes to looking at this contract with Comtech and having input on operations and getting information about what goes wrong when things happen?,139,,
1252,0.97,8197.689,8199.324,Sure.,140,,
1253,0.97,8199.324,8200.792,"Thank you very much, Councilmember.",140,,
1254,0.97,8200.792,8202.861,It stands for public safety answering point.,140,,
1255,0.97,8202.861,8210.869,And that's kind of the Acronym for the 911 centers.,140,,
1256,0.97,8210.869,8216.841,"So they are actually--that contract, I believe, resides at the state level.",140,,
1257,0.97,8216.841,8227.319,"Because it impacts all--not just Washington, Comtech's contract is further beyond the state of Washington.",140,,
1258,0.97,8227.319,8232.657,They have 911 services for a vast area.,140,,
1259,0.97,8232.657,8238.296,So the state administers the 911 program through the county 911 systems.,140,,
1260,0.97,8238.296,8241.433,"Ours is King County 911 through the county, through the I.T.",140,,
1261,0.97,8241.433,8241.733,Department.,140,,
1262,0.97,8241.733,8255.981,"And so the--as far as the way that we funnel our complaints through is through the county, who takes it up to the state.",140,,
1263,0.97,8255.981,8263.088,So our ability to impact Comtech or tell them what they can and can't do is really limited.,140,,
1264,0.97,8263.088,8267.359,We just have to use the representative authority through the King County 911 officer.,140,,
1265,0.97,8267.359,8271.963,And they have been a great champion and a great partner in this.,140,,
1266,0.97,8271.963,8281.506,"They jumped on that and filed the appropriate tickets and have been working aggressively to find out what happened, what we can do to fix it and make sure it doesn't happen again.",140,,
1267,0.97,8281.64,8283.441,Thank you.,141,,
1268,0.97,8283.575,8288.613,Thanks for that question.,142,,
1269,0.97,8288.613,8295.787,I have a couple additional questions before I jump in I want to see if any of my other colleagues do as well?,142,,
1270,0.97,8295.787,8310.802,So just interested to know whether or not--there was a national century link outage in December of 2018.,142,,
1271,0.97,8310.802,8321.413,Are these the same types of issues that we're looking at here locally as what was seen with the National outage several years ago?,142,,
1272,0.97,8321.413,8334.959,"And then as it relates to this particular event, you may have covered it, I'm sorry, were all King County 911 Dispatchers affected?",142,,
1273,0.97,8334.959,8341.132,"If not, what was different about the centers themselves that were not affected?",142,,
1274,0.97,8341.132,8341.366,Sure.,143,,
1275,0.97,8341.366,8341.733,Great questions.,143,,
1276,0.97,8341.733,8346.971,"So the telephone switching system throughout the United States, of course, is very tiered.",143,,
1277,0.97,8346.971,8349.607,You have the big ones covering nationwide stuff.,143,,
1278,0.97,8349.607,8352.51,That's the 2018 one that you referred to.,143,,
1279,0.97,8352.51,8358.616,And then it breaks down by regions into much smaller granules.,143,,
1280,0.97,8358.616,8364.155,So the answer to your question is a little bit of yes and no.,143,,
1281,0.97,8364.155,8368.193,"Yes, in that they are similar in that they were switching problems.",143,,
1282,0.97,8368.193,8373.498,But that's probably about as close as they were related.,143,,
1283,0.97,8373.498,8377.369,The 2018 outage was a Cascade-Type failure.,143,,
1284,0.97,8377.369,8387.045,"That was a software programming issue where when the switch failed, the system was set up to transfer the load of calls to another switch.",143,,
1285,0.97,8387.045,8399.19,"And what happened is through some software problems, they started transferring, you know, these huge loads, national call value to other switches.",143,,
1286,0.97,8399.19,8405.53,"And with each subsequent failure, the switch, in that case, could not handle the additional load.",143,,
1287,0.97,8405.53,8409.267,They started failing faster and faster.,143,,
1288,0.97,8409.267,8423.848,"You know, again, I guess if you were thinking of an analogy, if you had a couple of dump trucks and one got a flat tire, it would be hard to take the dirt and put it in another dump truck.",143,,
1289,0.97,8423.848,8427.285,The tires would be under more stress.,143,,
1290,0.97,8427.285,8430.321,"And eventually, you bury the dump truck.",143,,
1291,0.97,8430.321,8430.989,That was the National outage.,143,,
1292,0.97,8430.989,8443.568,"At the local level at the state level, this was another switch issue that didn't fall over properly.",143,,
1293,0.97,8443.568,8444.402,A different magnitude.,143,,
1294,0.97,8444.402,8450.275,And this went caused--we don't know yet if it was software or not.,143,,
1295,0.97,8450.275,8457.549,But it was not caused by a surge load from a switch failure in the line.,143,,
1296,0.97,8457.549,8461.119,It was solely independent on its failure.,143,,
1297,0.97,8461.119,8469.694,"And the second part, Oh, all the piece Apps in King County were affected by this about the same time.",143,,
1298,0.97,8469.694,8478.036,"I suspect because of our call volume and signs, we were one of the earlier ones to notice it than some of the others.",143,,
1299,0.97,8478.036,8488.546,It wasn't long into the incident when we started reaching out to King County 911 and found out everybody is having the same problem.,143,,
1300,0.97,8488.546,8488.88,Thank you.,144,,
1301,0.97,8488.88,8505.063,"And then moving forward, you talk about whether or not the Cscc has a continuity of operations plan that can be used in situations like this.",144,,
1302,0.97,8505.063,8525.95,"And sort of what's the plan in th unlikely likelihood, but one that we would need to plan for that both the Seattle dispatch centers are down simultaneously both at Cscc and Fsd.",144,,
1303,0.97,8525.95,8535.326,"Also, just interested to know what's happening at the county or state level to increase continuity planning.",144,,
1304,0.97,8535.326,8546.604,"And Lastly, how the county-wide 911 platform modernization project for next generation 911 might reduce the likelihood of similar outages in the future?",144,,
1305,0.97,8546.604,8546.738,.,144,,
1306,0.97,8546.738,8547.305,"Sure, Yeah.",145,,
1307,0.97,8547.305,8548.239,More great questions.,145,,
1308,0.97,8548.239,8551.709,We have a continuity of operations plan.,145,,
1309,0.97,8551.709,8557.949,"Unfortunately, it's a pretty old one.",145,,
1310,0.97,8557.949,8560.919,It's still reminiscent from when 911 was under the police Department.,145,,
1311,0.97,8560.919,8564.389,It has a lot of the police Department stuff over the top of it.,145,,
1312,0.97,8564.389,8569.394,"Unfortunately, we have been wanting and trying to get to it.",145,,
1313,0.97,8569.394,8579.637,"But because we're working on the staffing issues for the back office support staffing as well, we haven't had anybody to kind of give it the refresh yet.",145,,
1314,0.97,8579.637,8591.115,"But that plan does address different types of failures, like you were asking about, Councilmember, as far as is it part of the fail over type system.",145,,
1315,0.97,8591.115,8602.293,"To address your question as far as big surges if both centers happen to be out, for example, and as you mentioned, both centers, at least on the local level, act as a backup for each other.",145,,
1316,0.97,8602.293,8612.136,"If we have to physically leave either of the 911 centers in Seattle, they backup to each other.",145,,
1317,0.97,8612.136,8617.141,The Dispatchers would come to the center or vice versa.,145,,
1318,0.97,8617.141,8623.014,We did experience Tward the end of last year one such failure that you were talking about.,145,,
1319,0.97,8623.014,8630.355,I think I mentioned the previous testimony before the committee there was a transformer that blew in Interbay.,145,,
1320,0.97,8630.355,8643.067,It caused a surge and made a big enough explosion that the 911 center received within a single minute about 80 911 calls about the explosion.,145,,
1321,0.97,8643.067,8645.336,"Reporting it, asking about it, and Whatnot.",145,,
1322,0.97,8645.336,8654.612,"In that type of a surge or a failure, the system is designed and all 911 centers are designed to appoint a backup center.",145,,
1323,0.97,8654.612,8661.886,"The city of Seattle, the Cscc in this case, identified Spokane as the backup location.",145,,
1324,0.97,8661.886,8665.323,That has to do with geographic diversity.,145,,
1325,0.97,8665.323,8672.53,If we get an earthquake or something like that.,145,,
1326,0.97,8672.53,8677.969,"In that case, Spokane did receive the overflow calls.",145,,
1327,0.97,8677.969,8681.372,They identified it was a Kwat problem but had no ability to assign them.,145,,
1328,0.97,8681.372,8689.48,But they were able to reach out to us in that case as far as the log number of calls and Whatnot.,145,,
1329,0.97,8689.48,8700.224,"To update you on the project, the project is well underway now as far as the 911 modernization throughout the King County.",145,,
1330,0.97,8700.224,8705.763,And this is our net or how we're all connected here at the county level.,145,,
1331,0.97,8705.763,8713.971,"And that will, as you mentioned, have the potential to reduce, if not eliminate a lot of these types of challenges.",145,,
1332,0.97,8713.971,8730.288,"All of the phone systems for the 911 centers in the county will be identical, and we will not be limited to going from the fire alarm center to Cscc and back and forth.",145,,
1333,0.97,8730.288,8731.289,It will provide options.,145,,
1334,0.97,8731.289,8734.992,We haven't worked out a lot of the policy about the capability.,145,,
1335,0.97,8734.992,8741.966,It will allow some of the capability for the folks to go to other 911 centers in the county as a backup option.,145,,
1336,0.97,8741.966,8747.305,We have to work on how they get the dispatching and the radio access.,145,,
1337,0.97,8747.305,8754.912,"From a phone perspective, yes, they will be able to log on at other 911 centers and start receiving Seattle 911 calls.",145,,
1338,0.97,8754.912,8757.515,We're very excited about that project as it continues along.,145,,
1339,0.97,8757.648,8761.352,Thank you so much.,146,,
1340,0.97,8761.352,8767.625,Thank you for taking the time to be with us today.,146,,
1341,0.97,8767.625,8770.862,And all the work that you're doing.,146,,
1342,0.97,8770.862,8773.631,Any other questions from Councilmembers still with us?,146,,
1343,0.97,8773.631,8775.466,Not seeing any.,146,,
1344,0.97,8775.466,8780.571,We'll conclude this item.,146,,
1345,0.97,8780.571,8781.706,"Again, thank you, director Lombard.",146,,
1346,0.97,8781.839,8783.641,Thank you very much.,147,,
1347,0.97,8783.641,8789.68,"And next public safety and human services committee is scheduled for Tuesday, January 25th.",148,,
1348,0.97,8789.68,8793.017,That's at 9:30 A.M.,148,,
1349,0.97,8793.017,8800.291,Any comments from my colleagues? all right.,148,,
1350,0.97,8800.291,8801.392,Seeing none.,148,,
1351,0.97,8801.392,8804.595,It is 11:59 A.M.,148,,
1352,0.97,8804.595,8805.062,And we are adjourned.,148,,
1353,0.97,8805.062,8805.663,"Thank you so much, everybody.",148,,
1354,0.97,8805.663,8805.897,Be well.,148,,
