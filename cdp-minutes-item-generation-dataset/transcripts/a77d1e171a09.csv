25,0.97,93.726,100.8,We're then going to hear from the parks Department on the recommendation of a couple of new commissioners for the committee's consideration.,14,,
26,0.97,100.8,107.173,So it should be a fairly quick committee meeting.,14,,
27,0.97,107.173,115.782,"By some of the standards of the past committee meetings that have been heavy, particularly on homelessness agenda items.",14,,
28,0.97,115.782,146.446,So looking forward to this to drill into a great new public asset that the Council has been monitoring for several years ad then over the past several months as very much activated the core of district 7 and looking forward to that consideration of filling up some of our boards and commissions which we know is very pressing after the last couple years of having fewer nominees to consider.,14,,
29,0.97,146.446,149.149,So those are going to be the agenda items.,14,,
30,0.97,149.149,154.354,"And with that, we'll go to public comment to hear what folks have to say on those agenda items.",14,,
31,0.97,154.354,157.824,So I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner.,14,,

58,0.97,275.908,282.548,"And as you know, our park has been impacted repeatedly and often Disasterously by the crisis of homelessness in our city.",20,,
59,0.97,282.548,293.026,"At the same time, we have schools use our parks daily, we have Moms and Dads with their kids at the Playground and on the trails, young people and seniors in the park at different times of the day.",20,,
60,0.97,293.026,297.63,And we just need parks as a refuge and a place of restoration and recreation.,20,,
61,0.97,297.63,302.302,And we need meaningful and effectiveness homelessness assistance.,20,,
62,0.97,302.302,307.34,And we need the continued commitment of the city and the regional homelessness authority to make this happen.,20,,
63,0.97,307.34,316.516,"As you know, in our--we're just appreciative of the commitment of the regional homelessness authority.",20,,

66,0.97,326.626,329.729,And I'll go ahead and seed the rest of my time.,20,,
67,0.97,330.596,334.167,"Thank you, the next Speaker is David Haynes.",21,,

77,0.97,364.731,369.102,And thank you to the Council for supporting this Programto help get folks off the street.,25,,
78,0.97,369.102,378.277,"We had over the lifetime of the program, since we launched in Ãš2015, over 2500 people sheltered in tiny House villages.",25,,
79,0.97,378.277,390.189,"In 2021, we served 745 Unduplicated folks to get off the street and get connected to shelter and services and eventually a home.",25,,
80,0.97,390.189,396.429,56% of the folks that we serve found permanent housing or transitional housing.,25,,
81,0.97,396.429,397.163,50% being permanent.,25,,
82,0.97,397.163,406.806,So this is an incredibly successful model where typically you see a mat on the floor type shelter has a much lower success rate.,25,,
83,0.97,406.806,410.476,65% of folks move out within six months.,25,,
84,0.97,410.476,412.812,About 114 days is the median stay in the program.,25,,
85,0.97,412.812,421.254,"So just wanted to share those really great numbers and thanks to the support of the Council, the tiny House village program continues to be a success.",25,,
86,0.97,421.254,422.088,Thank you so much.,25,,
87,0.97,422.088,424.891,And we'll be following up with more information.,25,,

96,0.97,455.188,464.03,"Thank you so much, before we begin the presentation, can we do a quick round of introductions from the panel by stating name and role?",30,,
97,0.97,464.03,473.172,"And Todd, why don't we begin with you, and once you have introduced yourself, maybe Popcorn it off to the next person on the panel so we can keep it rolling here.",30,,
98,0.97,473.172,473.673,Very good.,31,,
99,0.97,473.673,475.475,Thank you.,32,,

102,0.97,481.38,484.75,"I'm going to turn it over to my brother, Tim.",33,,
103,0.97,484.75,489.222,"Hello Chairperson, and fellow Councilmembers, good to see everybody again.",34,,
104,0.97,489.222,495.695,"I'm Tim, I'm the chairman of Ovg.",34,,
105,0.97,495.695,501.133,"Thank you, Tim, hello Chairperson and everybody, Steve Madson.",35,,
106,0.97,501.133,504.07,Executive vice president and general manager for climate pledge arena.,35,,
107,0.97,504.07,504.37,Great.,36,,
108,0.97,504.37,510.743,And I want to just state for the record before the presentation that Councilmember Mosqueda has joined the committee.,36,,
109,0.97,510.743,517.617,"And Parker, if you'll let the record reflect that Councilmember Mosqueda is now present.",36,,
110,0.97,517.617,521.587,"So with that, I don't know how you guys have organized the presentation.",36,,
111,0.97,521.587,523.856,But I'll turn it over to you.,36,,
112,0.97,523.856,529.629,And we ask that committee members hold questions until the conclusion of the presentation.,36,,
113,0.97,529.629,532.164,And I look forward to hearing an update.,36,,
114,0.97,532.164,540.239,I'll take the chair's prerogative here at the beginning and say I've been now to climate Plenl arena on three separate occasions.,36,,
115,0.97,540.239,543.175,It's a great asset at Seattle center campus.,36,,
116,0.97,543.175,545.177,I've had a great time every time I've been there.,36,,
117,0.97,545.177,549.582,And I look forward to hearing more about how things are going and what the future might have in store.,36,,
118,0.97,549.582,551.284,So I'll hand it over to the panel.,36,,
119,0.97,551.284,551.918,Thank you.,36,,
120,0.97,551.918,553.119,Thank you.,37,,
121,0.97,553.119,557.59,So let me speak briefly before we put up the presentation.,37,,
122,0.97,557.59,566.532,So I just want to start by thanking members of the Council who are on this call who helped give life to this dream.,37,,
123,0.97,566.532,573.506,This was a long time coming and this community really Wrestled for a long time with how we were going to fix this.,37,,
124,0.97,573.506,578.444,"I was here in Seattle for many years, I ran the Seahawks and then left.",37,,
125,0.97,578.444,581.18,My brother convinced me that we could fix that arena.,37,,
126,0.97,581.18,583.616,And convinced me to come back home.,37,,
127,0.97,583.616,587.586,And what we've seen in the last four years is a dream come true.,37,,
128,0.97,587.586,603.202,"Through the courage of a lot of people, my brother included, but certainly this city Council, and Debra Juarez, you did something not many other people have ever done, and that is you read every single page of a very complicated Three- party agreement.",37,,
129,0.97,603.202,604.637,So we're just very appreciative.,37,,
130,0.97,604.637,607.073,We want to be super respectful of time.,37,,
131,0.97,607.073,620.72,"But you know, in these times, when there is a lot of division and some Accra Mohney we have a great story to tell.",37,,
132,0.97,620.72,635.101,We would have never thought we would embark on this knowing we were going to walk into a global pandemic but big ideas sustain themselves even in the toughest of times and that's what we've done.,37,,
133,0.97,635.101,641.207,The other thing I would say to start out is that we know that there's not anything we can't do substantially better.,37,,
134,0.97,641.207,644.644,And that truly our best days are in front of us.,37,,
135,0.97,644.644,659.925,"So without further adieu, we want to just give you a quick overview of what we've done and we're actually going to start on something we're so proud of, which is Sustainability, and we're going to go to that slide now, and I'm going to turn it over to my brother, Tim.",37,,
136,0.97,659.925,670.736,"So as everyone knows, mostly because you encouraged us, you inspired us, and you pushed us, we are the first carbon neutral arena in the history of planet earth.",38,,
137,0.97,670.736,674.974,Very proud of the commitment we've made towards trying to save our globe.,38,,
138,0.97,674.974,688.421,"In addition to that, we have integrated really Enterersing moments of truth for everybody to experience as part of walking through and being at an event at climate pledge arena.",38,,
139,0.97,688.421,698.097,"So it is amazing, the steps we've taken to the be the greenest arena in the world, as it should be in Seattle.",38,,
140,0.97,698.097,702.935,Everything we set out to do and goals and ambitions we have to be declared carbon neutral.,38,,
141,0.97,702.935,715.014,"We're on track, we're hitting all of our different meters, and so at this point, the last major step for Steve Madson and his team is the elimination of Single-Use plastic.",38,,
142,0.97,715.014,718.951,And we've committed to that by 2024.,38,,
143,0.97,718.951,722.221,So amazing step forward for the planet.,38,,
144,0.97,722.221,730.763,And absolutely the right place to start this movement here in Seattle.,38,,
145,0.97,730.763,732.665,"Steve, any further comment on that?",39,,
146,0.97,732.665,735.701,I couldn't be more proud to be a leader in this.,40,,
147,0.97,735.701,736.869,We don't want to follow.,40,,
148,0.97,736.869,738.504,We want to be a leader and we are.,40,,
149,0.97,738.504,742.274,One of the things obviously we're very proud of what we built.,41,,
150,0.97,742.274,744.51,But we're also super proud of how we built it.,41,,
151,0.97,744.51,749.482,And the next page really shows that whole process.,41,,
152,0.97,749.482,762.928,"Led by Ovg, we set goals and some set the goal of $136 million in Gauging minority owned businesses and contractors might be an Outlier.",41,,
153,0.97,762.928,768.734,"But in fact, because of our commitment to the men and women in the unions and labor, we've exceeded that goal.",41,,
154,0.97,768.734,770.402,And we couldn't be more proud.,41,,
155,0.97,770.402,773.038,And I'll let me brother comment on that.,41,,
156,0.97,773.038,781.213,"Again, we made a commitment early on, in particular, influence and I would say gently pushed by Debra.",42,,
157,0.97,781.213,787.052,"On making sure that we were of the people, by the people, and for the people.",42,,
158,0.97,787.052,789.288,And this was true lay Seattle project.,42,,
159,0.97,789.288,793.359,Not only were we very proud of the fact that the Union trades built this arena.,42,,
160,0.97,793.359,816.515,"But our commitment to Wmbe was at $179 million and in particular, we had 88 different firms from Seattle that ultimately participated in the development of this particular arena that were minority owned or are in particular qualifying in the Wnba standards.",42,,
161,0.97,816.515,817.416,So surpassed it.,42,,
162,0.97,817.416,820.186,As my brother will now tell you.,42,,
163,0.97,820.186,827.159,We have continued this commitment based on our hiring of our full-time and part time employees.,42,,
164,0.97,827.159,829.295,So we wanted to be different.,43,,
165,0.97,829.295,829.795,We are different.,43,,
166,0.97,829.795,830.563,We're in Seattle.,43,,
167,0.97,830.563,832.565,We can do things differently.,43,,
168,0.97,832.565,838.604,And so another thing we're super proud of is the organization that's been put together to run this enterprise.,43,,
169,0.97,838.604,845.845,An arena and a hockey team that really set goals to be one of the most diverse organizations in sports across North America.,43,,
170,0.97,845.845,846.879,And we've achieved it.,43,,
171,0.97,846.879,848.514,But we're not done.,43,,
172,0.97,848.514,855.12,But some quick Statistics close to 45% of our staff represent gender diversity.,43,,
173,0.97,855.12,860.059,25% of our staff represent Bipoc diversity.,43,,
174,0.97,860.059,861.393,We place great emphasis on this.,43,,
175,0.97,861.393,866.832,And I'm going to briefly comment that tomorrow night our hockey team plays in Winnipeg.,43,,
176,0.97,866.832,870.302,And tomorrow night we make history.,43,,
177,0.97,870.302,875.307,As the Play-By-Play announcer for your Seattle Kraken and the color analysts are both African Americans.,43,,
178,0.97,875.307,876.508,It's never been done in sports.,43,,
179,0.97,876.508,879.111,And it hasn't been done certainly in the Nhl.,43,,
180,0.97,879.111,881.513,And we're only on the front end of this.,43,,
181,0.97,881.513,886.852,This is a fundamental part of who we are in our DNA and we're going to keep pushing.,43,,
182,0.97,887.486,890.155,We want to talk a little bit about community.,43,,
183,0.97,890.155,899.064,And at the risk of reading words which I was told never to do in a presentation I'm going to read a few words here if we can go to the next page.,43,,
184,0.97,899.064,903.636,We took the arena and team and pushed them together to create the one roof foundation.,43,,
185,0.97,903.636,907.606,And we really think about our world and our community a little bit differently.,43,,
186,0.97,907.606,913.445,The well being of an individual's connection to well being of every other individual.,43,,
187,0.97,913.445,915.414,"Homelessness, racism, inequity, don't affect just those.",43,,
188,0.97,915.414,916.882,They affect all of us.,43,,
189,0.97,916.882,919.618,They affect all of us in the community.,43,,
190,0.97,919.618,923.722,The health of humanity is tied inextricably to our planet.,43,,
191,0.97,923.722,926.625,"And we're all in this together, the one roof.",43,,
192,0.97,926.625,927.726,We just started.,43,,
193,0.97,927.726,933.532,And I'm so proud of the work that we've done all ready in the community.,43,,
194,0.97,933.532,935.668,We've cast partnerships with youth care.,43,,
195,0.97,935.668,939.405,We've raised millions of dollars all ready for youth care.,43,,
196,0.97,939.405,945.177,"And there were expectations set forth of what we would do, we've tried to beat those expectations at every turn.",43,,
197,0.97,945.177,955.321,"For instance, when we launch the team name, 100% of the proceeds from the initial merchandise that went on sale went to our friends at youth care.",43,,
198,0.97,955.321,960.793,"But it's more than youth care, it's other organizations that fit the mission I just talked about.",43,,
199,0.97,960.793,961.794,It's community passage ways.,43,,
200,0.97,961.794,964.129,It's the urban League.,43,,
201,0.97,964.129,969.702,It's the refuge women's alliance.,43,,
202,0.97,969.702,972.037,It's the Dawanish River River clean up efforts.,43,,
203,0.97,972.037,974.073,It's a big project we're doing in South park.,43,,
204,0.97,974.073,978.277,It was a project my brother put together to open the building with cold play.,43,,
205,0.97,978.277,980.646,And we'll talk about that in a moment.,43,,
206,0.97,980.646,981.814,We've only just begun.,43,,
207,0.97,981.814,983.782,We have the arena with us.,43,,
208,0.97,983.782,989.154,I'm here Alt D 5 at our beautiful Kraken committee ice Pleaches.,43,,
209,0.97,989.154,994.56,"Everyday in this community, something good is on happening for the community by the organization.",43,,
210,0.97,994.56,996.562,That's really how we've been chartered.,43,,
211,0.97,996.562,999.098,Those are things that we set up.,43,,
212,0.97,999.098,1003.869,But one of the issues that people are most concerned about was transportation.,43,,
213,0.97,1003.869,1013.812,"And I'm going to ask Steve to talk about how we focused on transportation, how we worked hard for literally years in advance and some of the is success we've had.",43,,
214,0.97,1013.812,1016.014,"Thank you, Todd.",44,,
215,0.97,1016.014,1020.686,"As of yesterday, we've been open 120 days since October 19th.",44,,
216,0.97,1020.686,1023.589,"That's 53 events and over 600,000 people.",44,,
217,0.97,1023.589,1029.795,"We knew going into this, one of our Stigmas was going to be transit transportation.",44,,
218,0.97,1029.795,1031.864,Getting people to and from and not disrupting.,44,,
219,0.97,1031.864,1037.703,"But as we check down some of those biggest issues, we couldn't be more proud in this area.",44,,
220,0.97,1037.703,1042.374,Where we've been able to bring people to and from largely through public transit.,44,,
221,0.97,1042.374,1045.11,Our role in the mono rail is a big part of that.,44,,
222,0.97,1045.11,1052.317,"Where we've had up to 5000 to 6000 Kraken fans on a 17,000 sell out coming through the mono rail.",44,,
223,0.97,1052.317,1056.755,We think it's our future that gets less vehicles off the road.,44,,
224,0.97,1056.755,1060.392,It's part of our commitment to the climate pledge.,44,,
225,0.97,1060.392,1061.627,And it's working.,44,,
226,0.97,1061.627,1064.463,This is literally a screen shot from our App.,45,,
227,0.97,1064.463,1065.731,And we give people choices.,45,,
228,0.97,1065.731,1070.469,And you can see that driving and parking is down the way here.,45,,
229,0.97,1070.469,1080.212,One of the things we did to encourage public transportation is we literally embedded a pass in every ticket sold by the hockey team.,45,,
230,0.97,1080.212,1082.681,And we think the first organization to do it.,45,,
231,0.97,1082.681,1086.351,The results have been awesome.,45,,
232,0.97,1086.351,1102.968,"So Dan, you know, Andrew, the success we've had in your district in keeping people from all driving, and really it was viewed as one of our most challenging issues, but in fact we're so proud of what's happened in transportation and how we've been respectful to the neighborhood.",45,,
233,0.97,1102.968,1105.437,We made a 7 Million-Dollar investment in the mono rail.,45,,
234,0.97,1105.437,1106.338,And it's worked.,45,,
235,0.97,1106.338,1108.54,And there's more work to be done there.,45,,
236,0.97,1108.54,1110.709,But the initial results are absolutely terrific.,45,,
237,0.97,1110.709,1112.044,And on any given night.,45,,
238,0.97,1112.044,1113.812,Any given hockey game.,45,,
239,0.97,1113.812,1117.549,"25% of the people are taking the mono rail, the last mile.",45,,
240,0.97,1117.549,1125.591,"And when East and West connects on sound transit, this is going to be an idea whose time really came.",45,,
241,0.97,1125.591,1128.327,We want to talk a little bit about events.,46,,
242,0.97,1128.327,1132.965,"And I'm going to turn it over to my brother Tim, and we start with a slide on Covid.",46,,
243,0.97,1132.965,1135.1,Because we've had great plans.,46,,
244,0.97,1135.1,1138.537,But something big happened along the way.,46,,
245,0.97,1138.537,1143.709,"And so we paid great attention to this and built best practices, Tim.",46,,
246,0.97,1143.709,1154.119,We led the charge on trying to implement standards that were important to the health and wellness of not only our employees and our part time employees but all of our customers.,47,,
247,0.97,1154.119,1160.425,We were the first organization in the live entertainment industry to go mandatory on Vacs pace Thats.,47,,
248,0.97,1160.425,1169.101,"Every one of our employees, every part time employees, every vendor, and every one of their employees, we required vaccination early on.",47,,
249,0.97,1169.101,1171.236,"Amazingly, very little kick back.",47,,
250,0.97,1171.236,1173.605,So we were proud of that.,47,,
251,0.97,1173.605,1175.941,We've done a phenomenal job with our compliment to clear.,47,,
252,0.97,1175.941,1191.623,"And using clear path to verify vaccination of all customers that are coming into the building and finally, we have seen zero cases within our Full- time staff and our part time staff of any outbreaks.",47,,
253,0.97,1191.623,1208.273,"And so, if you take into consideration the roughly $50 million we spent on a new air ventilation system, that ultimately is state of the art for how we cleanse our air and how we trap germs within our building.",47,,
254,0.97,1208.273,1212.611,It's a revolutionary building as to the standards that we created to keep people safe.,47,,
255,0.97,1212.611,1221.119,"Very proud that we opened the building first with the hometown heroes, Fu fighters who came in and did an amazing show.",47,,
256,0.97,1221.119,1235.367,"Proud to announce that we made a half million dollar for charities that both the Fu fighters and us will donate back to local and regional charities, and in particular, a heavy emphasis on charities that are green focused.",47,,
257,0.97,1235.367,1245.444,And then we had literally millions of people tune into the opening of climate pledge arena from around the world on Amazon prime for the opening of cold play.,47,,
258,0.97,1245.444,1251.116,It was one of the largest streamed live concerts in the history of the industry.,47,,
259,0.97,1251.116,1257.222,"Shinning a bright light not just on Seattle, Seattle center, but our commitment to carbon neutral.",47,,
260,0.97,1258.156,1262.527,"Steve, this next page is just shows that have happened.",48,,
261,0.97,1262.527,1266.431,And Steve is going to share that we haven't hit our show numbers yet.,48,,
262,0.97,1266.431,1268.233,But we're going to.,48,,
263,0.97,1268.233,1271.536,In large part because artists are anxious to play in this building.,48,,
264,0.97,1271.536,1274.506,"We think the dark cloud of Covid is lifting, Steve.",48,,
265,0.97,1274.506,1277.342,We were blessed to open to full capacity.,49,,
266,0.97,1277.342,1284.149,"That was done only under these stringent rules and we've done it now over 600,000 people.",49,,
267,0.97,1284.149,1286.852,We're 27 games into the Kraken season.,49,,
268,0.97,1286.852,1288.086,We're 14 concerts in.,49,,
269,0.97,1288.086,1290.756,We've hosted Seattle U and other basketball.,49,,
270,0.97,1290.756,1296.028,And proud to show the versatility of this Venue.,49,,
271,0.97,1296.028,1300.332,That I think we're seeing just how hungry this community was.,49,,
272,0.97,1300.332,1303.335,For a new modern arena.,49,,
273,0.97,1303.335,1304.87,That the region needed it.,49,,
274,0.97,1304.87,1307.406,And we're delivering it.,49,,
275,0.97,1307.406,1310.375,A hockey team has had an amazing reception.,50,,
276,0.97,1310.375,1312.944,"Tim, did you want to add anything?",50,,
277,0.97,1312.944,1320.485,"Yeah, I'll just add look, you know, at the end, we'll talk to you about problems that we're still solving, and problems that we need to overcome.",51,,
278,0.97,1320.485,1324.356,The largest issue we have is we're 40 events short of where we projected to be.,51,,
279,0.97,1324.356,1330.328,And so that will probably turn out to be about a 35 Million- dollar hit year one.,51,,
280,0.97,1330.328,1333.899,Because of Covid.,51,,
281,0.97,1335.267,1337.636,And this certainly hasn't been for the faint of heart.,52,,
282,0.97,1337.636,1339.137,But we've had the fans with us.,52,,
283,0.97,1339.137,1342.074,And I'm going to talk a little bit about our hockey team here.,52,,
284,0.97,1342.074,1345.31,The reception has been incredible.,52,,
285,0.97,1345.31,1357.656,"This next picture, image really shows that people have stood and cheered despite the challenges, despite the Intrepidation of being in public places, our support has just been awesome.",52,,
286,0.97,1357.656,1363.228,And something great that's happened for us is our players are proud to pull that Jersey on.,52,,
287,0.97,1363.228,1365.697,They're proud to wear the s on their chest.,52,,
288,0.97,1365.697,1370.569,And our Jersey is not only one of--is the best selling in the National hockey League.,52,,
289,0.97,1370.569,1373.805,It's one of best selling Jerseys in the entire world.,52,,
290,0.97,1373.805,1380.011,"Just for the record, we don't retain all of that revenue, it goes to a League wide pot.",52,,
291,0.97,1380.011,1388.42,"But we're so proud, any where we travel, there's Kraken fans in the community wearing our gear and cheering the team on.",52,,
292,0.97,1388.42,1394.259,"Most importantly, they've showed up at our arena and created a great place for our team to play.",52,,
293,0.97,1394.259,1398.33,We've now won as many games as we won the first half of the season.,52,,
294,0.97,1398.33,1401.233,We lost 17 games by a goal or less but by a goal.,52,,
295,0.97,1401.233,1404.87,But we're going to build this team the right way.,52,,
296,0.97,1404.87,1406.805,We're going to build it through the draft.,52,,
297,0.97,1406.805,1409.541,We're going to build it in a very smart way.,52,,
298,0.97,1409.541,1411.91,We don't want to be one that wonders.,52,,
299,0.97,1411.91,1414.713,We want to build a team that can win here long-term.,52,,
300,0.97,1414.713,1421.486,"And we're doing enthusiasm I'll just pause and say this past weekend, we did something that no other team in the league had done.",52,,
301,0.97,1421.486,1425.023,And that is we invited fans to a skills competition.,52,,
302,0.97,1425.023,1430.262,"10,000 fans showed up to see who could shoot the fastest Puck.",52,,
303,0.97,1430.262,1432.664,Who could tape their stick the fastest.,52,,
304,0.97,1432.664,1434.533,We did all sorts of wonderful things.,52,,
305,0.97,1434.533,1439.504,But the most important thing we did is we took 100% of the ticket proceeds.,52,,
306,0.97,1439.504,1443.041,"$100,000 and put it back to work through the one roof foundation.",52,,
307,0.97,1443.041,1447.979,"E when we stood up in front of you and made promises about giving back to the community, we meant it.",52,,
308,0.97,1447.979,1451.383,And we're living it.,52,,
309,0.97,1452.117,1475.44,"And then the last slide we have before we can open this up to questions is we've also built something pretty fantastic in D 5. we felt that if we were going to be serious about this, and serious about giving back to community, we couldn't put our training facility in some remote suburban location or in a business park.",52,,
310,0.97,1475.44,1479.11,So this was as ambitious as anything we've done.,52,,
311,0.97,1479.11,1481.646,"We built 165,000 square foot facility right here.",52,,
312,0.97,1481.646,1486.017,It's the centerpiece of the remake of the North gate mall.,52,,
313,0.97,1486.017,1493.225,"This year on a calendar basis, at the end of this year, we will attract 1 million people through our doors.",52,,
314,0.97,1493.225,1503.368,"Three sheets of ice, a medical clinic, a full on Starbucks where 100% of the proceeds go back to community and a fantastic bar and grill, the 32 bar and grill.",52,,
315,0.97,1503.368,1507.973,"Again, doing all of this in a very, very dark and challenging time.",52,,
316,0.97,1507.973,1514.346,"And what happens when this dark cloud LIFTS, our best days are going to be in front of us.",52,,
317,0.97,1514.346,1523.355,"So Chairperson, Lewis, we are happy to answer any questions, I want to actually turn it back over to my brother and see if he had any additional remarks?",52,,
318,0.97,1523.355,1528.126,"Just, Chairperson, before questions, I'd add two additional things.",53,,
319,0.97,1528.126,1530.762,The cloud is lifting.,53,,
320,0.97,1530.762,1538.503,We're very appreciative of the city and the state and the way you've handled trying to guide us through this virus.,53,,
321,0.97,1538.503,1542.941,And this crisis that is probably the largest any of us will face in our time.,53,,
322,0.97,1542.941,1551.249,"We're proud that during all of this, this team was just named as the best new arena in all of the world.",53,,
323,0.97,1551.249,1554.185,So an amazing compliment back to Seattle.,53,,
324,0.97,1554.185,1570.335,We have a very special announcement coming this Friday on I think the most significant artist to play the building since we've opened that will create a 60 year loop and connect the dots and be something extraordinary.,53,,
325,0.97,1570.335,1572.103,We still have issues and problems.,53,,
326,0.97,1572.103,1585.35,"I think the biggest issue we'll have going forward now is working and asking for the help of the state, city, and county on--we're doing something that's fairly unique, Chairperson, and that is we're paying taxes.",53,,
327,0.97,1585.35,1592.557,And so one of the pieces we had to work through is the valuation of the building in which we'll pay taxes on.,53,,
328,0.97,1592.557,1606.504,"And asking for some help to make sure that we don't get taxed on things like Covid mitigation, our commitment to climate pledge, our commitment to preserving the roof, so we still have work to do.",53,,
329,0.97,1606.504,1620.719,"But I would say over all, considering everything we dealt with, getting this building open, having the accolades for Seattle that we've been able to garner and on behalf of you, our commitment to the Seattle center campus.",53,,
330,0.97,1620.719,1625.123,Our commitment to being a mirror image of the community that we represent.,53,,
331,0.97,1625.123,1629.561,And with a platform that ultimately helps those that have fallen through the safety net.,53,,
332,0.97,1629.561,1631.396,We're very proud to be your partner.,53,,
333,0.97,1631.396,1636.801,And we thank you profusely for giving us this opportunity.,53,,
334,0.97,1636.801,1639.571,"Well, thank you so much for that presentation.",54,,
335,0.97,1639.571,1650.815,"I mean, I'll just start off on one of the points that was just mentioned at the tail end around the impressive public health measures and Covid mitigation measures that were made.",54,,
336,0.97,1650.815,1655.253,This is something that I have definitely noticed.,54,,
337,0.97,1655.253,1656.021,"You know, Anecdotally.",54,,
338,0.97,1656.021,1665.33,"And my visits have been very impressed by, with the clear App and all the other precautions that the arena has been taking.",54,,
339,0.97,1665.33,1675.473,"And really appreciate that modeling of how to do big indoor events in a way cognizant of public health guidance, it makes our jobs a lot easier, so thank you so much.",54,,
340,0.97,1675.473,1679.11,I have a couple questions and then I'll open it up to committee members.,54,,
341,0.97,1679.11,1684.249,"The first one, the slide went by a little quickly.",54,,
342,0.97,1684.249,1695.226,But do you factor into the Sustainability impact some of your transportation mitigation measures? I didn't necessarily see if that was incorporated on the slide.,54,,
343,0.97,1695.226,1702.801,"Because it seems like you're doing be right back well, I mean I know you're doing really great work that we covered in the slide on the mono rail and everything else.",54,,
344,0.97,1702.801,1721.152,I'd be curious to know what the impact of that has been relative to an arena Thats has not mitigated what would otherwise be a large volume of single occupancy vehicle trips that are just being taken out of contention because of the Souping up of the mono rail.,54,,
345,0.97,1721.152,1726.091,The transit passes being sold along with the tickets and the seasons passes.,54,,
346,0.97,1726.091,1739.804,And I wonder if that's something that's been looked into in terms of the impact relative to an otherwise situated arena that's not doing that transportation mitigation work.,54,,
347,0.97,1739.804,1744.342,"Very good question, Chairperson.",55,,
348,0.97,1744.342,1747.378,So here's one way of putting it.,55,,
349,0.97,1747.378,1751.75,We're so overwhelmed with how well we've done on mitigation measures.,55,,
350,0.97,1751.75,1755.687,Our parking numbers are half of what we projected day one.,55,,
351,0.97,1755.687,1761.626,"Good news, bad news, for you and us since we share the parking revenue with the city.",55,,
352,0.97,1761.626,1768.066,At the end of the day we're shocked with how many people have grown accustomed with the mono rail.,55,,
353,0.97,1768.066,1771.069,In using light rail to get to the mono rail station.,55,,
354,0.97,1771.069,1773.638,And take that into the Seattle center campus.,55,,
355,0.97,1773.638,1778.009,We've not had the traffic accident or congestion that everybody warned would happen.,55,,
356,0.97,1778.009,1779.744,That hasn't been an issue.,55,,
357,0.97,1779.744,1812.577,"I think the this only gets better as time goes along, but yes, every trip count, every car that comes to our building and parks for one of our events, council person, we then put that back into our mitigation members and our emission standards that we then have to go balance out with either activities in the building that eliminate carbon or carbon credits that we have to then acquire in order to pay for the emissions that are being created from the cars that park.",55,,
358,0.97,1812.577,1816.614,We go as far as a carbon green tax.,55,,
359,0.97,1816.614,1822.353,That Steve puts on every event for every truck that comes into that building on behalf of an artist.,55,,
360,0.97,1822.353,1840.939,And a commitment they make for making sure that they are equally as committed as we are for creating either carbon credits or carbon standards to balance out the emissions created by whatever they use to get to Seattle and the production trucks that they used in order to carry their equipment.,55,,
361,0.97,1840.939,1853.785,So we are to the car adding that into our equation and trying to make that partly of what we need to overcome to get to carbon neutral by the end of this year.,55,,
362,0.97,1853.785,1861.292,"We're measured every year by the future, the living future Institute.",56,,
363,0.97,1861.292,1863.294,Every year we have to produce results.,56,,
364,0.97,1863.294,1864.863,We're measuring event by event.,56,,
365,0.97,1864.863,1871.102,I'd also add that one of the largest solar farms in the entire state is on top of the roof on the building now.,56,,
366,0.97,1871.102,1876.074,Which is the community ice Plex.,56,,
367,0.97,1876.074,1876.341,Great.,57,,
368,0.97,1876.341,1878.243,Thanks for that clarification.,57,,
369,0.97,1878.243,1885.083,"Can I ask then, if it's half of the anticipated parking, which is that in real numbers.",57,,
370,0.97,1885.083,1886.517,What are you seeing?,57,,
371,0.97,1886.517,1891.389,What was anticipated in terms of the total number of single vehicle trips?,57,,
372,0.97,1891.389,1896.027,"Councilperson, I don't know the exact number of cars off the top of my head.",58,,
373,0.97,1896.027,1906.371,I can tell you it's about a 5 Million-Dollar Miss on what we projected in parking revenue for the city and us compared to what actually occurred.,58,,
374,0.97,1906.371,1907.171,"Again, fairly good news story.",58,,
375,0.97,1907.171,1911.509,"I tell my brother, I get mad at him occasion.",58,,
376,0.97,1911.509,1913.945,He's done too good a job on the mono rail.,58,,
377,0.97,1913.945,1916.814,"But look, these are the things we have to learn in our industry and live without.",58,,
378,0.97,1916.814,1921.519,"And as much as I will tell you, we Miss that revenue this year, because of Covid.",58,,
379,0.97,1921.519,1924.989,And the number of events that have disappeared on us.,58,,
380,0.97,1924.989,1930.361,I will tell you we are going to learn to live without parking revenue if we have to.,58,,
381,0.97,1930.361,1933.531,Because there's no way to be carbon neutral without that commitment.,58,,
382,0.97,1933.531,1941.839,So we're going to have to adjust going forward and understand we have done a good job of convincing people to take the mono rail to come to the campus.,58,,
383,0.97,1941.839,1945.41,I don't think every year will be 5 million Miss for us and you.,58,,
384,0.97,1945.41,1963.161,But I think what we are learning is there's been a tremendous pattern that's been established by the Kraken and the concerts of trying to convince what is about 4500 of our customers to use the mono rail on any given night.,58,,
385,0.97,1963.161,1965.897,Which is just an amazing number.,58,,
386,0.97,1965.897,1971.903,"Andrew, we're so excited, we are thinking about adding a dining car on the mono rail.",59,,
387,0.97,1971.903,1972.37,Just kidding.,59,,
388,0.97,1972.37,1974.272,"You got me all excited there, Todd.",59,,
389,0.97,1974.272,1975.873,That would have to be really quick.,59,,
390,0.97,1975.873,1979.711,It would have to be all Microwaveable food.,59,,
391,0.97,1979.711,1980.545,"And Popcorn, really fast.",59,,
392,0.97,1980.545,1985.183,It would be Popcorn that was Prepopped.,60,,
393,0.97,1985.183,1985.45,Yeah.,61,,
394,0.97,1985.45,1988.319,Cooked in advance.,61,,
395,0.97,1988.319,1988.519,Yeah.,61,,
396,0.97,1988.519,1991.356,And the Microwave would be around Virginia.,61,,
397,0.97,1991.356,1995.526,"By that point, you're about a quarter done with the ride.",61,,
398,0.97,1995.526,1997.161,So Exielting.,62,,
399,0.97,1997.161,2003.868,"There was discussion of another building and what people said is well, you can't say building kills transportation.",62,,
400,0.97,2003.868,2005.97,When sound transit connects East to West.,62,,
401,0.97,2005.97,2008.473,The Hub of that is in basement of the mono rail.,62,,
402,0.97,2008.473,2012.443,This is going to be one of the most accessible buildings in the entire world.,62,,
403,0.97,2012.443,2014.479,And it's one thing to say it's accessible.,62,,
404,0.97,2014.479,2017.215,It's another thing for the fans to prove that it is.,62,,
405,0.97,2017.215,2024.889,And to use the embedded Orca pass inside every ticket and come to the games by using public transportation.,62,,
406,0.97,2024.889,2026.724,It's super exciting.,62,,
407,0.97,2026.724,2027.058,Excellent.,63,,
408,0.97,2027.058,2031.996,"Well, I will now open it up to committee members.",63,,
409,0.97,2031.996,2034.732,I see Councilmember Mosqueda has raised her hand.,63,,
410,0.97,2034.732,2036.868,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",64,,
411,0.97,2036.868,2039.47,I believe Councilmember Herbold was in front of me.,64,,
412,0.97,2039.47,2043.141,"In case you'd like me to wait, I'm happy to hold back.",64,,
413,0.97,2043.141,2044.776,I apologize.,65,,
414,0.97,2044.776,2049.614,I didn't see Councilmember Herbold had raised her hand.,65,,
415,0.97,2049.614,2051.783,But of course I'll take your word for it.,65,,
416,0.97,2051.783,2054.285,"If she was first, she was first.",65,,
417,0.97,2054.285,2054.886,Councilmember Herbold.,65,,
418,0.97,2054.886,2055.686,Thank you so much.,66,,
419,0.97,2055.686,2057.388,I really appreciate it.,66,,
420,0.97,2057.388,2066.13,Don't care the order in which I'm called for future reference but really appreciate everybody's kindness here.,66,,
421,0.97,2066.13,2074.872,And I apologize for not being on Cam Rasm and there's so much to be so excited about here in this presentation.,66,,
422,0.97,2074.872,2084.015,"This is just, you know, a wonderful project where we have so much to be proud of.",66,,
423,0.97,2084.015,2090.188,I appreciate the vision as well as the stewardship and the city's role in making all this happen.,66,,
424,0.97,2090.188,2099.23,"And I just want to make sure that in my questions, we don't lose sight of that.",66,,
425,0.97,2099.23,2104.135,I do have a couple questions in capacity as chair of the human services committee.,66,,
426,0.97,2104.135,2120.117,I want to say I appreciate all the financial investments is that Tha this project is make Intoog so many social safety net programs.,66,,
427,0.97,2120.117,2129.827,I received a message that due to the loss of dates at the climate pledge arena and the inability to find alternate options there's not going to be a Seattle King County health clinic this year.,66,,
428,0.97,2129.827,2142.54,"And I know over the last six years they've been able to provide $20 million in dental, vision, medical, and social services to over 23,000 participants.",66,,
429,0.97,2142.54,2149.013,I know that they're going to try to Replicate the vision clinic.,66,,
430,0.97,2149.013,2153.551,But is it true the clinic can't be accommodated any time during the climate pledge arena.,66,,
431,0.97,2153.551,2156.621,This is such an amazing opportunity.,66,,
432,0.97,2156.621,2159.123,I promote it on all my social media every year.,66,,
433,0.97,2159.123,2165.73,And I know it's really something that the community loves.,66,,
434,0.97,2165.73,2176.34,And I think I hold some responsibility for failing to make sure that our agreements has potential displacement.,66,,
435,0.97,2176.34,2178.142,I assume that's the case.,66,,
436,0.97,2178.142,2179.744,But that's my primary question.,66,,
437,0.97,2179.744,2183.447,And then I have a much shorter one.,66,,
438,0.97,2183.447,2185.583,"Okay, Steve, do you want to answer that?",67,,
439,0.97,2185.583,2187.251,Or I'm happy to.,67,,
440,0.97,2187.251,2190.888,"Go ahead, Todd, I'll add on.",68,,
441,0.97,2190.888,2194.992,"We work everyday with Robert, a great steward of what we're doing.",69,,
442,0.97,2194.992,2197.061,Some of it is working through dates.,69,,
443,0.97,2197.061,2200.798,One of the complications is we have a lot of Wnba playoff dates.,69,,
444,0.97,2200.798,2209.44,I'm going to pause and say we have an absolutely fantastic relationship with the Seattle storm.,69,,
445,0.97,2209.44,2214.412,And there are people that said Maybe that's not going to happen.,69,,
446,0.97,2214.412,2219.05,Maybe people coming in with all the pressures won't have a great relationship with the storm.,69,,
447,0.97,2219.05,2221.285,It's as great a relationship as one could have.,69,,
448,0.97,2221.285,2224.989,And we truly consider them partners and they have a special season coming up.,69,,
449,0.97,2224.989,2228.859,"Part of the challenge has been working through dates, working through their playoff dates.",69,,
450,0.97,2228.859,2230.628,We're committed to making it happen.,69,,
451,0.97,2230.628,2235.366,And we're looking at alternatives right now.,69,,
452,0.97,2235.366,2237.335,We will get back to you specifically on this issue.,69,,
453,0.97,2237.335,2242.64,And I Plenl to get back to you some time in the next couple weeks as we sort this through.,69,,
454,0.97,2242.64,2244.508,We're working on it right now though.,69,,
455,0.97,2244.508,2245.209,That's so Imreat to hear.,70,,
456,0.97,2245.209,2246.911,Thank you so much.,70,,
457,0.97,2246.911,2259.423,"My other two additional very short questions, on page ten, the page that's devoted to your Covid protocols, it looks like everybody's masked.",71,,
458,0.97,2259.423,2263.427,"But on page 18, it's a huge number of people that aren't wearing masks.",71,,
459,0.97,2263.427,2273.904,And I'm wondering if you can talk more about--not so much what happens to get into the facility but what happens when you see people not wearing their masks during the event.,71,,
460,0.97,2273.904,2276.807,"And then my last question, I'm going to get it out there now.",71,,
461,0.97,2276.807,2278.843,Relates to the staffing.,71,,
462,0.97,2278.843,2283.581,Those are great numbers for women and Bipoc staffing percentages.,71,,
463,0.97,2283.581,2289.086,I'm wondering if they apply to full-time or part time or both?,71,,
464,0.97,2289.086,2299.964,"And if you do break them down, according to full-time and part time employees, Cothey hold about the same percentages?",71,,
465,0.97,2299.964,2300.197,Thanks.,71,,
466,0.97,2300.197,2302.967,Spheek so,71,,
467,0.97,2302.967,2306.07,So let me take the employees.,72,,
468,0.97,2306.07,2308.306,Certainly we're referring to full-time employee ts.,72,,
469,0.97,2308.306,2315.813,You're looking at three white guy s here.,72,,
470,0.97,2315.813,2319.984,But we're proud of our retention of great people.,72,,
471,0.97,2319.984,2324.622,We have a reputation where other organizations want to come and take folks from us.,72,,
472,0.97,2324.622,2328.059,And people want to say because we're building something different here.,72,,
473,0.97,2328.059,2329.293,I'll let Steve comment on that.,72,,
474,0.97,2329.293,2337.034,"I'm looking at this picture, this could have been early in the season, because our compliance on masks has been as good as any arena in the world.",72,,
475,0.97,2337.034,2339.336,We have people coming in and watching every game.,72,,
476,0.97,2339.336,2345.81,And our come Plains--compliance has been terrific.,72,,
477,0.97,2345.81,2347.978,I'll check on that.,72,,
478,0.97,2347.978,2350.181,And I owe you a second response.,72,,
479,0.97,2350.181,2352.116,The masks for Councilmember Herbold.,73,,
480,0.97,2352.116,2358.422,You can see from Tex the exterior of the building.,73,,
481,0.97,2358.422,2361.292,When you're in the event.,73,,
482,0.97,2361.292,2367.765,"You'll see panels up to remind people to wear masks, it's supplemented with led throughout the building.",73,,
483,0.97,2367.765,2372.236,It's not a Swat team but reinforced regularly at this point.,73,,
484,0.97,2372.236,2378.209,We're proud of how we've been able to have that not become confrontational.,73,,
485,0.97,2378.209,2381.612,I'm very proud of our full-time staff.,73,,
486,0.97,2381.612,2383.781,Into the 45% female.,73,,
487,0.97,2383.781,2384.115,25% diverse.,73,,
488,0.97,2384.115,2388.519,"On the part time staff, that approximate 900 Staph.",73,,
489,0.97,2388.519,2398.362,I can't tell you the exact percentages there but one of our city obligations we're proud of is the full and part time workers that worked at key arena previously.,73,,
490,0.97,2398.362,2401.065,That we had a worker retention program with.,73,,
491,0.97,2401.065,2403.868,Many of which have joined us in the ranks of the arena.,73,,
492,0.97,2403.868,2408.572,Thank you so much both of you.,74,,
493,0.97,2412.443,2415.546,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,74,,
494,0.97,2415.546,2416.046,Councilmember Mosqueda.,74,,
495,0.97,2416.046,2419.383,It was the question I had as well about the health clinics.,75,,
496,0.97,2419.383,2427.158,So thank you for your commitment to getting back to us on whether or not there's a date available beyond wanting to support it.,75,,
497,0.97,2427.158,2429.293,I know that people actually need it.,75,,
498,0.97,2429.293,2435.966,And that should not be on climate pledge arena to solve for lack of access to health care.,75,,
499,0.97,2435.966,2437.701,This is one safety net element.,75,,
500,0.97,2437.701,2439.503,But I wish it wasn't needed.,75,,
501,0.97,2439.503,2442.907,And we will work to make sure it's not needed in the future.,75,,
502,0.97,2442.907,2443.741,We'll continue that effort.,75,,
503,0.97,2443.741,2451.549,"But in the meantime, thanks for continuing to try to find days for that important event for folks who do rely on it for medical and dental care.",75,,
504,0.97,2451.549,2458.122,The second thing I want to raise is also related to the Vaccinations and the great work that you all have done.,75,,
505,0.97,2458.122,2462.059,You talked about the stringent rules that you have within the arena.,75,,
506,0.97,2462.059,2466.23,And how those have been widely adopted by both patrons and staff.,75,,
507,0.97,2466.23,2468.232,And I think that's just so important to lift up.,75,,
508,0.97,2468.232,2470.701,So thank you for that work that you've done.,75,,
509,0.97,2470.701,2485.015,And for the strong public health policies and commitment to helping address our population's health through the policies at the arena while also making it possible for folks to enjoy the events there.,75,,
510,0.97,2485.015,2498.462,"With the news today, from King County that the vaccine requirements for places like restaurants is going to go away, I have heard a number of folks all ready called me and said we wanted those in place.",75,,
511,0.97,2498.462,2501.699,It's helpful for workers to know there's a backstop.,75,,
512,0.97,2501.699,2512.71,So if people are coming in and they do take off their masks to eat for example or in the rare occasion that maybe they're at climate pledge arena and eating in the stands there.,75,,
513,0.97,2512.71,2515.279,Workers know that folk it is a are there are Vaccinated.,75,,
514,0.97,2515.279,2517.147,That's important too for the players.,75,,
515,0.97,2517.147,2523.787,"Myself, I have a two-year-old, and she's not yet eligible for vaccines so knowing I'm going inside somewhere.",75,,
516,0.97,2523.787,2526.523,And they've verified for vaccines is really important to me.,75,,
517,0.97,2526.523,2540.504,"So I'm just wondering if there's any effort or possibility to still require vaccine verification for patrons and if you're going to continue to keep it in place for a while, your vaccination requirements and the processes you've put into place?",75,,
518,0.97,2540.504,2543.04,So we're looking at all that right now.,76,,
519,0.97,2543.04,2545.776,We're proud of the work we've done.,76,,
520,0.97,2545.776,2548.445,The adoption of our App was incredible.,76,,
521,0.97,2548.445,2550.981,And it wasn't easy.,76,,
522,0.97,2550.981,2556.086,"Because there's different--every man, woman, and child in this community has a reason to come to the building.",76,,
523,0.97,2556.086,2560.724,And it means there's a lot of diverse people coming with a lot of diverse opinions.,76,,
524,0.97,2560.724,2563.594,But we were steadfast in vaccine verification.,76,,
525,0.97,2563.594,2564.428,And it wasn't easy.,76,,
526,0.97,2564.428,2568.766,And there was tension in the Plaza at times but we held true to what we believe.,76,,
527,0.97,2568.766,2578.776,And that was following government policy and being fully Compliant to what our elected leaders feels is the right thing if our community.,76,,
528,0.97,2578.776,2581.745,So we'll always follow the government's direction here.,76,,
529,0.97,2581.745,2584.014,And we followed the county.,76,,
530,0.97,2584.014,2585.683,So now they've given new edict.,76,,
531,0.97,2585.683,2594.291,"We have to do examination on whether policies are for our own employees, what they are for workers in the building.",76,,
532,0.97,2594.291,2595.526,And give us a little time.,76,,
533,0.97,2595.526,2596.927,We just read this as well.,76,,
534,0.97,2596.927,2599.129,And it's work in progress.,76,,
535,0.97,2599.129,2606.904,"One thing to add on the first point, council person, we are committed to the health clinic.",77,,
536,0.97,2606.904,2618.515,"And it's just trying to--the good News/Bad news is all the dates that disappeared for the first fiscal year have all moved to the next year, and we're under siege on dates.",77,,
537,0.97,2618.515,2628.158,We're currently--we have some ideas on some things with an Nba team possibly coming to the building and having a few days in the building.,77,,
538,0.97,2628.158,2631.228,So there's a lot going on that we're trying to balance out.,77,,
539,0.97,2631.228,2647.945,"What we did do, much to the credit of my brother, is when people started falling through the cracks during Covid, and the United way went out and raised money to put meals on the table for people that couldn't afford it, and again, we're literally starving.",77,,
540,0.97,2647.945,2649.713,We donated a million dollars.,77,,
541,0.97,2649.713,2655.386,"And so we are very conscientious of, as you said, those in need.",77,,
542,0.97,2655.386,2666.53,And we also understand the platform that that clinic serves for people that can't afford to get regular health care or health check UPS.,77,,
543,0.97,2666.53,2668.699,So we hear you loud and clear.,77,,
544,0.97,2668.699,2673.771,And it's something we're trying to figure out how to come up with a solution for.,77,,
545,0.97,2675.839,2679.209,"Councilmember Mosqueda, do you have any further questions in",78,,
546,0.97,2679.209,2681.278,"No, thanks on both fronts.",79,,
547,0.97,2681.278,2688.485,I appreciate you all being a leader in the public health arena.,79,,
548,0.97,2688.485,2691.255,And for the work that you've done during Covid.,79,,
549,0.97,2691.255,2694.491,Because I think it really showed people what's possible.,79,,
550,0.97,2694.491,2709.64,"And these large crowds that are gathering, you know, if you're saying there hasn't been an infection among the team, that's great evidence to bring to other cities, and I think it just continues to show our leadership in this corner of the country.",79,,
551,0.97,2709.64,2714.078,"And Debra Juarez, Council President, she invited me to come to a Kraken game.",79,,
552,0.97,2714.078,2715.846,I'm still waiting for that ticket.,79,,
553,0.97,2715.846,2721.151,I still haven't been yet.,79,,
554,0.97,2721.151,2729.293,"By the way, Todd, Interestingly enough, the only place where we actually had to deal with a Covid outbreak was actually the team.",80,,
555,0.97,2729.293,2731.628,And it was on the road.,80,,
556,0.97,2733.197,2734.398,Yeah.,81,,
557,0.97,2734.398,2740.27,"We, you know, I just want to say that we're Brimming with enthusiasm.",82,,
558,0.97,2740.27,2743.173,"And we have some very, very interesting and power.",82,,
559,0.97,2743.173,2749.546,"Announcements we're going to make in the coming weeks, the next couple months, we have a big announcement on Friday.",82,,
560,0.97,2749.546,2764.361,"So this only, you know, a I said, if we can take the shot that the last two years has brought, I would have never thought that we would launch something like this in the middle of the global pandemic.",82,,
561,0.97,2764.361,2767.331,"My Brothers fortitude of hanging in there, never cutting a corner.",82,,
562,0.97,2767.331,2770.3,It's a credit to Lbg.,82,,
563,0.97,2770.3,2774.071,It's a credit to David and the ownership of the Kraken.,82,,
564,0.97,2774.071,2776.64,We signed up to be great partners.,82,,
565,0.97,2776.64,2779.009,We're going to endeavor to do that everyday.,82,,
566,0.97,2779.009,2786.55,"Watch our news, we're going to announce some things that reinforce much of what we talked about today in the coming weeks.",82,,
567,0.97,2786.55,2786.817,Great.,83,,
568,0.97,2786.817,2789.019,"I have a few more questions, but before I do.",83,,
569,0.97,2789.019,2794.024,I want to make sure no other Councilmembers have anything?,83,,
570,0.97,2794.024,2795.392,It doesn't look like they do.,83,,
571,0.97,2795.392,2800.497,So I have two more questions before you guys leave.,83,,
572,0.97,2800.497,2808.872,The first one is I've noticed a big Uptick in obviously in economic activity in the uptown neighborhood.,83,,
573,0.97,2808.872,2812.643,Since you guys started having games.,83,,
574,0.97,2812.643,2820.684,48 home game as year as I recall is no small amount of gathering thousands of people to the neighborhood.,83,,
575,0.97,2820.684,2834.831,"I've heard Anecdotally and seen evidence that backs this up that a lot of restaurant owners and small businesses, and you know, the bookstore on Mercer street, like a lot of these places are getting a lot of renewed foot traffic and business.",83,,
576,0.97,2834.831,2835.866,Due to this.,83,,
577,0.97,2835.866,2852.449,"I wonder if Oak view group, given the a single Asiduous amount of data you've been tracking.",83,,
578,0.97,2852.449,2862.526,That seems to be making a very big difference to a neighborhood suffering throughout Covid.,83,,
579,0.97,2862.526,2868.065,"Again, I don't have actual Statistics but I ultimately, you know, I walk.",84,,
580,0.97,2868.065,2870.0,My brother gives me a lot of grief.,84,,
581,0.97,2870.0,2872.336,I walk back and forth from the hotel.,84,,
582,0.97,2872.336,2878.141,"I actually lived in Seattle for six weeks, I won't tell you which Council districts so I avoid a fight.",84,,
583,0.97,2878.141,2880.344,But I saw the Uptick.,84,,
584,0.97,2880.344,2882.646,It broke my heart a little bit in October and November.,84,,
585,0.97,2882.646,2886.016,Because I was shocked at how many restaurants had closed down.,84,,
586,0.97,2886.016,2887.384,It was really telling.,84,,
587,0.97,2887.384,2891.388,Because there were so many store fronts that were empty or vacant.,84,,
588,0.97,2891.388,2895.058,And so many restaurants that just never opened their door.,84,,
589,0.97,2895.058,2896.26,I was there Monday night.,84,,
590,0.97,2896.26,2903.233,And one of the things I noticed is how different it is that the small restaurants and bars are all coming back.,84,,
591,0.97,2903.233,2911.541,And I think it's pretty cool that we have the ability to get people to come to games and have dinner before somewhere in the neighborhood.,84,,
592,0.97,2911.541,2913.81,Have a drink after words somewhere in the neighborhood.,84,,
593,0.97,2913.81,2915.412,Especially if they're on light rail.,84,,
594,0.97,2915.412,2918.148,I think that has to be an even higher priority.,84,,
595,0.97,2918.148,2924.655,"I will tell you, some of the announcements my brother is referring to are really geared towards tourism.",84,,
596,0.97,2924.655,2933.163,So we're working on three or four big events next year with the tourism and those that are trying to fill up hotel rooms and restaurants and bars.,84,,
597,0.97,2933.163,2937.467,We have some big ideas and some big events we're chasing.,84,,
598,0.97,2937.467,2944.574,"Because to your point, that's what really drives the economy and gets restaurants back on their feet.",84,,
599,0.97,2944.574,2949.646,"Yeah, I mean, I can just tell you, I mean even as far as Bell town.",85,,
600,0.97,2949.646,2951.581,People crediting a return to game days.,85,,
601,0.97,2951.581,2954.918,And people going to dinner before the game.,85,,
602,0.97,2954.918,2958.989,"I mean, it's really a massive difference.",85,,
603,0.97,2958.989,2959.222,And --,85,,
604,0.97,2959.222,2962.793,"And Andrew, part of it is where this arena is located.",86,,
605,0.97,2962.793,2964.861,It's in a neighborhood.,86,,
606,0.97,2964.861,2969.032,"And it made construction substantially more expensive, really challenging.",86,,
607,0.97,2969.032,2971.201,But we didn't have any challenges.,86,,
608,0.97,2971.201,2975.072,We did it in the most responsible way possible.,86,,
609,0.97,2975.072,2982.412,We hauled hundreds of thousands of square feet of dirt out of the campus at night without disruption to the neighborhood.,86,,
610,0.97,2982.412,2985.415,And we've tried to follow a neighborhood first policy.,86,,
611,0.97,2985.415,2987.551,We love our neighbors.,86,,
612,0.97,2987.551,2993.757,"And we're proud to see restaurants, bars, and book shops filled up as a result of this dream.",86,,
613,0.97,2993.757,2997.127,That's a good Segway to my next question.,87,,
614,0.97,2997.127,3000.964,And Councilmember Morales has her hand raised so she can close this out.,87,,
615,0.97,3000.964,3007.604,"But I did want to ask, the only complaint that I've heard about climate pledge.",87,,
616,0.97,3007.604,3017.514,Has been that some residents on the West edge of the arena where there's large concentrations of very bright lighting.,87,,
617,0.97,3017.514,3022.586,"Have complains about some of the effects, the level of brightness in the lighting.",87,,
618,0.97,3022.586,3030.427,And I Cowonder what the plans are going forward to mitigate as those complaints come.,87,,
619,0.97,3030.427,3037.667,It's foreseeable that kind of that light element is something that could have an effect on livability.,87,,
620,0.97,3037.667,3044.608,So I'm curious what--what we can do going forward to help some of those constituents mitigate that.,87,,
621,0.97,3044.608,3047.711,And what the arena's actions have been so far.,87,,
622,0.97,3047.711,3048.045,Yeah.,88,,
623,0.97,3048.045,3053.517,"Our actions were to dim the lights, to turn them off earlier than we actually had the right to.",88,,
624,0.97,3053.517,3055.685,And we will always listen.,88,,
625,0.97,3055.685,3061.525,We know that there's one tenant in that building across the street who continues to not be happy.,88,,
626,0.97,3061.525,3063.059,That's probably one too many for us.,88,,
627,0.97,3063.059,3065.962,And we'll try to do the best we can.,88,,
628,0.97,3065.962,3068.698,But we've been super responsible citizens.,88,,
629,0.97,3068.698,3069.833,We're good listeners.,88,,
630,0.97,3069.833,3071.401,We act upon things.,88,,
631,0.97,3071.401,3076.706,"I've--I'll write that down as my third take away here and be back to you, sir.",88,,
632,0.97,3076.706,3078.375,"Go ahead, Tim, I'm sorry.",89,,
633,0.97,3078.375,3079.576,Go ahead.,89,,
634,0.97,3079.576,3084.681,"Sorry, Chairperson, one other issue, just so we're not making excuses here.",90,,
635,0.97,3084.681,3091.188,Our Dimmer switches for our--a lot of our lighting panels on the campus haven't come in yet.,90,,
636,0.97,3091.188,3093.19,"So like everything, they got stuck in shipping.",90,,
637,0.97,3093.19,3096.259,And we're still waiting for them to come in.,90,,
638,0.97,3096.259,3100.897,And we're hoping that that's a part of the solution going forward.,90,,
639,0.97,3100.897,3109.106,"Well, I mean, it's encouraging to hear that, that there's a technology component that's not installed yet that might be able to mitigate the impact.",91,,
640,0.97,3109.106,3110.273,"So Yeah, no, that's great.",91,,
641,0.97,3110.273,3111.675,Let's stay in touch.,91,,
642,0.97,3111.675,3127.257,"You know, I'll just say that in working through this issue, Oak view group and the arena have been really good and responsive partners in trying to solve these issues.",91,,
643,0.97,3127.257,3129.493,Beyond what you're legally obligated to do.,91,,
644,0.97,3129.493,3132.996,But Filleting with your commitment to be a good neighbor.,91,,
645,0.97,3132.996,3136.867,I appreciate the opportunity for that discussion and appreciate your engagement.,91,,
646,0.97,3136.867,3139.703,"Councilmember Morales, your question?",91,,
647,0.97,3139.703,3140.971,Thank you.,92,,
648,0.97,3140.971,3143.673,"Chair Lewis, good afternoon, everybody.",92,,
649,0.97,3143.673,3151.014,I would love to get your thoughts about our Seattle Junior hockey Association.,92,,
650,0.97,3151.014,3157.888,"I'm sure you're familiar with, we have quite a robust system, you know, different leagues here.",92,,
651,0.97,3157.888,3161.224,Young people who are very excited about hockey.,92,,
652,0.97,3161.224,3169.833,"And they have, you know, in the past, and still, practiced at many Rinks that are sort of locally owned.",92,,
653,0.97,3169.833,3182.045,"So I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about how you plan to leverage your position and you know, work with the existing leagues.",92,,
654,0.97,3182.045,3191.655,"And particularly with the young people who are interested in hockey to develop, I don't know.",92,,
655,0.97,3191.655,3192.055,A collaborative.,92,,
656,0.97,3192.055,3201.031,"Developmentpipeline maybe for the Kraken and just how you're working with or plan to work with some of the local hockey leagues, particularly the young people.",92,,
657,0.97,3201.031,3202.199,Let me just pause.,93,,
658,0.97,3202.199,3203.3,I'm here at North gate.,93,,
659,0.97,3203.3,3207.571,And there's young Skaters right here learning to play the game.,93,,
660,0.97,3207.571,3210.907,We've seen an amazing amount of interest in the game.,93,,
661,0.97,3210.907,3214.611,Not just here at our three sheets but across the region.,93,,
662,0.97,3214.611,3228.191,"And what's been amazing, there was an initial concern that we might drain some of the interest from the other facilities, the snow King facilities in Renton, Bellview, or Snoqualmie.",93,,
663,0.97,3228.191,3229.492,Or down in Tacoma.,93,,
664,0.97,3229.492,3230.86,It hasn't happened.,93,,
665,0.97,3230.86,3232.696,Everyone's business is better.,93,,
666,0.97,3232.696,3242.572,And the activity we've had in this building has been substantially in the neighborhood and most all from the city of Seattle.,93,,
667,0.97,3242.572,3249.946,"When we talk about drawing potentially a million people through the doors here, most of those people, they'll be repeat customers.",93,,
668,0.97,3249.946,3254.384,Those aren't unique visits but most of those visitors will come from the city of Seattle.,93,,
669,0.97,3254.384,3254.851,We're just thrilled.,93,,
670,0.97,3254.851,3257.12,Because we want to grow the sport.,93,,
671,0.97,3257.12,3259.456,"And it's not just hockey, it's figure Skating.",93,,
672,0.97,3259.456,3266.83,We have a young man who's actually made it to the world regional tournaments for figure Skating.,93,,
673,0.97,3266.83,3276.072,"And our dream isn't just that somebody here today on this ice that I'm looking at makes it to the Kraken but someday, somebody on this ice makes it to the Olympics.",93,,
674,0.97,3276.072,3278.842,And those are really cool things that do motivate us.,93,,

678,0.97,3291.755,3293.023,That's an outside question.,95,,
679,0.97,3293.023,3295.925,This has been one of the greatest half hours of my week.,95,,
680,0.97,3295.925,3303.233,We need a couple more Scorers on our Seattle Kraken.,95,,

688,0.97,3336.7,3338.668,I'd be Remiss if I didn't ask one more thing.,97,,
689,0.97,3338.668,3342.105,Are we going to get an Nba team at climate pledge?,97,,
690,0.97,3342.105,3347.243,We literally are working on it everyday.,98,,
691,0.97,3347.243,3357.287,"And I'd add--because it doesn't get a lot of mention, I'll give my brother a lot of credit, we're also working, I think Seattle would be a wonderful place for a women's professional hockey League team.",99,,
692,0.97,3357.287,3361.491,"If that League starts back up gain, I think we owe it to balance that out.",99,,
693,0.97,3361.491,3362.892,So we understand both.,99,,
694,0.97,3362.892,3366.863,And we're focused on both.,99,,
695,0.97,3367.731,3369.799,Well thank you --,100,,

714,0.97,3453.683,3458.855,"Thank you and before I get started, congratulations to the Kraken.",105,,
715,0.97,3458.855,3463.526,And the Seattle center climate pledge arena is just magnificent.,105,,
716,0.97,3463.526,3465.695,I actually have been there.,105,,
717,0.97,3465.695,3469.065,And was fairly blown away.,105,,
718,0.97,3469.065,3481.311,So this topic is one that is going to kind of set a lot of wheels in motion for us as we appoint new members to a redefined board of park commissioners.,105,,
719,0.97,3481.311,3491.487,"As many of you were all ready aware, historically, we've had a separate board of park commissioners and a separate park district over sight committee.",105,,
720,0.97,3491.487,3502.899,"This citizen over sight Committee for the park district had over sight Obviously, ensuring that we had some transparent accountability to the park district.",105,,
721,0.97,3502.899,3512.375,"We essentially had two citizen groups functioning at a high level, advising the park Department on a variety of issues.",105,,
722,0.97,3512.375,3527.79,We were however constrained by the ability to have broad discussions because the scope of the park district over sight committee was limited to kind of the scope of the park district Governance and over sight.,105,,
723,0.97,3527.79,3535.064,And the broader park board dealt with a whole universe of public park and recreation issues.,105,,
724,0.97,3535.064,3547.577,"So last year, the council passed legislation to rename the board, expand its role, creating a board of park and recreation commissioners.",105,,
725,0.97,3547.577,3549.412,Capturing our underlining recreation mission.,105,,
726,0.97,3549.412,3550.213,And that name change.,105,,
727,0.97,3550.213,3554.017,So we're calling it the Dprc.,105,,
728,0.97,3554.017,3558.588,"And this combines the park Commission, and the Pdoc.",105,,
729,0.97,3558.588,3569.065,Or the park district over sight committee to improve public accountability.,105,,
730,0.97,3569.065,3578.174,"Diversity of representation, and knowledge of community volunteers in an efficient manner to create sustainable uses of our volunteer energy.",105,,
731,0.97,3578.174,3586.95,It allows the board to consider resources in the full context of the Department's over all mission.,105,,
732,0.97,3586.95,3590.887,"Funding, policies, and just a whole variety of needs.",105,,
733,0.97,3590.887,3597.894,So the board retains the representation of the 15 member structure of the former park district over sight committee.,105,,
734,0.97,3597.894,3610.106,"And this body will be responsible for the traditional duties of the park board and over sight of programs, policies, and reporting on specific park district issues.",105,,
735,0.97,3610.106,3620.049,"So today, we're here to add three new members to the new board.",105,,
736,0.97,3620.049,3626.789,"And I will introduce the first member, that is Justin Umagot.",105,,
737,0.97,3626.789,3630.093,He's a D one representative.,105,,
738,0.97,3630.093,3650.246,"Justin, as a lifelong participant and advocate for Seattle park and recreation programming, he's spent numerous years coaching out of Dell rich community center and serves on the board of associated recreation Council or better known as a Rrkc.",105,,
739,0.97,3650.246,3654.817,He made local travel dreams a reality for the county.,105,,
740,0.97,3654.817,3670.7,"His lifelong passion for professionalism, management, experience, public space, and desire to make the world a more equitable place for himself and future generations, including his daughter, motivates him to make positive changes where he can.",105,,
741,0.97,3670.7,3672.702,So that's Justin Umagot.,105,,
742,0.97,3672.702,3677.74,"And then the second candidate we have, is Stafford Mayes.",105,,
743,0.97,3677.74,3680.41,Stafford is a district seven representative.,105,,

746,0.97,3689.852,3695.224,He was also responsible for external PR in media and Online print.,105,,
747,0.97,3695.224,3707.136,"In addition, he focused on external relationships with civil rights and human service organizations as well as K 12 and minority colleges and university.",105,,
748,0.97,3707.136,3724.554,"He provided programs that provided equal access to technology to under served communities, these efforts delivered Microsoft technology, teacher preparedness, training and access for minority students, prior to joining Microsoft, Stafford earned a scholarship and played football at the University of Washington.",105,,
749,0.97,3724.554,3727.824,Stafford was drafted as a defensive line man for the St.,105,,
750,0.97,3727.824,3734.063,Louis Cardinals and Minnesota Vikings from 1980 through 1989.,105,,
751,0.97,3734.063,3743.439,Stafford served as a--served on local boards of several Nonprofits and speaks to very K 12 schools about academics and technology.,105,,
752,0.97,3743.439,3749.779,He's currently on the board of Oday high school.,105,,
753,0.97,3749.779,3752.381,And U power org.,105,,
754,0.97,3752.381,3753.583,So you'll hear from Stafford.,105,,
755,0.97,3753.583,3763.76,"And last but not least, we'd like to introduce you to Davon Thomas.",105,,
756,0.97,3763.76,3773.436,Davon is an Mpa student at the Evans school of public policy and Governance at the University of Washington.,105,,
757,0.97,3773.436,3778.641,"Through lived experience, he realized the important role parks and recreation plays in the community.",105,,
758,0.97,3778.641,3789.952,"As a child, his neighborhood community center taught seniors how to use laptops, provide Reentry workshops for former felons Sph so much more.",105,,
759,0.97,3789.952,3797.059,"He knows that recreational facilities serve as the bedrock of communities no matter one's age, Ethnicity or background.",105,,
760,0.97,3797.059,3808.838,"As a former student leader and Commissioner, he brings experience in public policy, youth enrichment and working to ensure local government helps communities they serve.",105,,
761,0.97,3808.838,3812.642,"Unfortunately, Davon was unable to join us today due to a scheduling conflict.",105,,
762,0.97,3812.642,3816.546,We will have two additional appointees coming before the committee.,105,,

764,0.97,3824.387,3844.774,"So again, our goal here is to have a representative from each Council district and I think what you'll hear today is that these appointees have a broad passion for community service and are passionate about Stewarding their community park and recreation departments.",105,,
765,0.97,3844.774,3848.511,So I'll turn it back over to the chair.,105,,
