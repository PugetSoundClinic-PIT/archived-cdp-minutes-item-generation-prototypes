164,0.97,1895.159,1905.403,Offering bonuses will not provide more safety as indicated in reports cited by others on this call status shows adding more police will not provide more public safety.,40,,

234,0.97,2508.305,2544.041,"We continue to see more and more learned of alternative forms of community safety and I think it is ironic that recent reports almost 60% exactly of SPD calls have a Non-Sworn, I know it's clear now when many of you committed last year human over a period of a few years and if you want to do it in bite sized pieces this is one of them.",60,,

238,0.97,2568.966,2584.181,Think of your time for future meetings with domestic workers bill of rights items we will try to have a professional translator on the line as this is the policy and practice of the city to make sure those who have that skill and expense get paid for it and it is adequate.,61,,
239,0.97,2584.181,2588.852,And accurate translation.,61,,
240,0.97,2588.852,2595.459,Plus continue on Madam clerk please read into the record item number one.,61,,

242,0.97,2603.901,2608.973,Thank you very much you want to introduce yourself?,63,,
243,0.97,2608.973,2618.716,I am with Council on staff glad to beer this morning.,64,,
244,0.97,2618.716,2628.926,"Thank you for the work you have done on the domestic workers bill of rights to begin with, thank you for the Follow- up work you have done in responding to this letter of recommendation.",65,,
245,0.97,2628.926,2648.312,We have seen you in committee before and a face we have not seen but was instrumental was LORI who was in our office as our intern doing tremendous work with you and visiting with members of the domestic worker standards board and a coalition working on affordable benefits.,65,,
246,0.97,2648.312,2652.816,I want to thank LORI for her work.,65,,
247,0.97,2652.816,2657.721,"Domestic workers ordinance passed in 2018, the first of its kind at the city level in the nation.",65,,
248,0.97,2657.721,2689.486,"We had eight other jurisdictions that were more at the state level but this was a historic passage at the city level guaranteeing access to minimum wage, guaranteeing rest and meal breaks for domestic workers, setting up the board providing recommendations to us today and we made sure the domestic worker standards board was composed of hiring entities and workers to make sure recommendations come to Council with the benefit of entities and the workers themselves.",65,,
249,0.97,2689.486,2701.999,Those recommendations were submitted on May 18th 2021 the first time we had a chance to receive recommendations from the board that was stood up the year prior and we had a presentation on July 20th.,65,,
250,0.97,2701.999,2716.38,That presentation has been linked to the Agendas and we have the opportunity to hear directly from the domestic worker standards board representatives and we have had multiple chances to hear during public testimony.,65,,
251,0.97,2716.38,2745.742,"The requirement for Committee is to respond to recommendations within 120 days, the office has engaged in multiple meetings with the standards board, the coalition of portable and if it's and have worked through some recommendations as well with the office of labor standards to identify if there are certain policy recommendations are funding recommendations to be advanced on a faster Timeline that did not require legislative action.",65,,
252,0.97,2745.742,2766.463,I want to thank members of the board in coalition for Sherry priorities and being present to walk us through those recommendations for engagement with the committee as we consider the board and coalitions request and worked together to refine our response in the letter in front of us.,65,,
253,0.97,2766.463,2786.784,I want to thank the office of labor standards and Steve as well as G & amp; a who have been engaged with us as we are looking for early action items that city and family could take in response to the recommendations put forward by the board in May.,65,,
254,0.97,2786.784,2817.848,The letter in front of you is the opportunity to recognize the important work and expertise as one of the colors said today the expertise that the board has included and commit to a few items for future engagement with the board and office of labor standards to see where we can make possible advancements and recommendations for funding and policy in this upcoming budget year.,65,,
255,0.97,2817.848,2831.829,"I will handed over to central staff to walk us through the committee response letter, this was Walk-Through in concept at the last meeting now we have the letter in front of us.",65,,
256,0.97,2831.829,2842.706,This is a chance to see how recommendations align with the five opportunities or options from the committee to respond to.,65,,
257,0.97,2842.706,2865.429,Again I want to note this is not us as a committee committing the full Council to any future action but a recognition that the committee would be interested in receiving proposals or additional information and potentially working with the standards board and office of standards for future policy as well so it falls into those categories.,65,,
258,0.97,2865.429,2894.691,"Interested in receiving proposals, learning more information and working on a longer Timeframe on some proposals as we welcome feedback and opportunity to work on these solutions again we cannot commit future councils or determine exactly what will come out of the budget process but more interested in receiving information working with them to advance recommendations.",65,,
259,0.97,2894.691,2897.594,I will turn it over to walk us through the letter.,65,,
260,0.97,2897.594,2908.605,I will begin by sharing my screen so members of the committee and the public can see the letter.,66,,
261,0.97,2908.605,2929.526,"There is no presentation for this, instead we will focus directly on the language of the letter and I will begin with a note that there will be a forthcoming Spanish translation of the letter which should be available on the Website later today or tomorrow morning.",66,,
262,0.97,2929.526,2956.453,For my presentation today since there was a more in-depth conceptual presentation on July 20th we will give a high-level overview of things that remain the same from the previous presentation and then more information and some Clarifications that exist in the final version of the committee response to domestic worker standards board.,66,,
263,0.97,2956.453,2984.247,"As Councilmember Mosqueda mentioned the board presented recommendations on May 18th and there were four broad areas of focus investing in community expertise building trust providing materials and resources to those affected, and limiting policy changes or improvement to the rights domestic workers have and then mandating portable benefits.",66,,
264,0.97,2984.247,3005.168,"The committee response will fall into one or more of the five categories supporting the submission of proposal, requesting more information, requesting the board to develop alternatives, rejecting the proposal for reason or requesting a longer Timeline.",66,,
265,0.97,3005.168,3035.232,"None of the responses to the recommendations include rejection it is either one of these remaining options and sometimes there is more than one sometimes it is changed in the final version of the letter and in order to provide the board with clarification and help with priority setting, since they are eager to work on a large number of projects sometimes more than one response can help the board figure out how to Prioritize what comes next.",66,,
266,0.97,3035.232,3054.05,In the interest of time you can see there is a fair amount of narration but I will move ahead to one of the charts at the end of the letter which provides a summary by recommendation of the committee response.,66,,
267,0.97,3054.05,3086.483,"To begin the first recommendation was to fund community organization that Los has contracts with, a wide variety of community and business organizations to be the anchor of outreach for the community so the board is recommending to further build on the trust of these community partners and recognizing domestic worker outreach is inherently different and more difficult than other types of outreach for labor standards.",66,,
268,0.97,3086.483,3091.588,They are interested in more funds to make the work happen.,66,,
269,0.97,3091.588,3111.808,So the board would support a submission from the board or office of labor standards for the proposal and the proposal could come in the form of the office of labor standards budget proposal that would be presented in September board could be a separate proposal from the board made directly to Councilmembers.,66,,
270,0.97,3111.808,3128.725,"Number two is recommendation to compensate domestic workers for expertise, domestic worker serving on the standards board and perhaps workers who are entering information in the form of a focus group or survey.",66,,
271,0.97,3128.725,3168.431,The last presentation and the draft version of the letter there was a potential response of request for further information that remains the same with extra clarification and the narrated part of the letter recognizing Los has identified a path to paid workers within the existing budget and there needs to be more time to figure out the trajectory of the path to vet it with the law Department and think about it within the framework similarly situated with boards and commissions across the city.,66,,
272,0.97,3168.431,3181.177,This would be requesting more information pending the result of the Los process to learn more about using their budget to pay domestic workers.,66,,
273,0.97,3181.177,3190.253,Number three is recommendation to fund development of new outreach materials and to expand language access for interpretation.,66,,
274,0.97,3190.253,3227.924,The board or the committee WELCOMES sufficient proposal to fund recommendation with clarification that the idea of funding a mailing to go to all households in Seattle or a targeted segment of households in Seattle that has been wrapped up in the recommendations as well and that would be contemplated considering a consultant the board is interested in hiring to learn more about what would be the most effective methods for outreach.,66,,
275,0.97,3227.924,3231.127,So this is a two-part response.,66,,
276,0.97,3231.127,3242.739,Supporting the recommendation of the proposal and a longer Timeline pending the results of the consultant recommendations.,66,,
277,0.97,3242.739,3251.815,"Next is funding improvement of the domestic worker section on the Los Website, a similar response from the committee.",66,,
278,0.97,3251.815,3267.23,It would be supporting submission of proposal and wanting to learn more from the office of labor standards and feedback from others about the scope of the project and what will work best to improve the Website to make it more User- friendly.,66,,
279,0.97,3267.23,3290.587,"Number five is recommendation to ensure third-party platform compliance with domestic workers ordinance, those would be third parties like a App based Nanny Website or Brick-And-Mortar Nanny services or cleaning services company that might hire workers that are then sent into a family home.",66,,
280,0.97,3290.587,3314.811,"So, what is different about this is that instead of requesting a submission of proposal it is requesting more information with Stakeholder engagement on this issue and also pending more Stakeholder engagement and wanting to learn more about where compliance is lacking in third parties.",66,,
281,0.97,3314.811,3319.382,Number six would be addressing the devastating impact of Healthcare for domestic workers.,66,,
282,0.97,3319.382,3349.312,This would be the same requesting or saying there would be support for legislative changes in the state Legislature and also wanting to allow more time for the recommendations so office of labor standards could engage in a interdepartmental team to learn more about how other departments about how to improve direct access to Healthcare for domestic workers.,66,,
283,0.97,3349.312,3388.485,Number seven regarding implement in policy changes would be requiring hiring entities to provide domestic workers with information about rights and conditions of work so the notice of rights is standard for other labor standards as a requirement and the domestic workers ordinance is recommended but not required so this would be supporting the submission of proposal to put before the Council in 2022 so that 2022 is adding clarification for next year.,66,,
284,0.97,3388.485,3393.189,Number eight eliminating exclusion of publicly funded Homecare workers of the worker ordinance.,66,,
285,0.97,3393.189,3420.617,"The committee would support this submission of proposal to put before the Council next year ending Stakeholder engagement and number nine eliminating the interference standard for joint hiring entity liability, the committee is interested in this on a longer Timeline pending Stakeholder engagement and further research and the board Prioritization of the issue.",66,,
286,0.97,3420.617,3457.053,For reference right now the domestic worker ordinance would not hold a customer who engaged a domestic worker through a third party such as a cleaning company or a Nanny services provider and less the family directly interfered with worker rights such as this denying rest for its or denying a meal period or discrimination or Harassment so that would be pending further Stakeholder engagement on whether or not to move forward.,66,,
287,0.97,3457.053,3462.826,Last is recommendation to develop affordable benefits for domestic workers.,66,,
288,0.97,3462.826,3482.879,This response has not changed but it has been clarified the committee would support submission of proposal for the 22-2022 budget funding office of labor standards to develop policy in collaboration with the board and community partners for review in 2022.,66,,
289,0.97,3482.879,3498.161,So that would mean the committee would be supportive of a resolution Memorializing the committee support for Los developing a portable benefits policy in conjunction with the community.,66,,
290,0.97,3498.161,3518.815,There could be something in the budget process as well with a statement of legislative intent or funds added to the budget to support office of labor standards during the work recognizing it would take significant time and extra staffing and there might be more funding needed for consultants.,66,,
291,0.97,3518.815,3523.82,So that is the overview of all of the recommendations.,66,,
292,0.97,3523.82,3527.323,Are there any questions?,66,,
293,0.97,3527.323,3532.228,Thank you very much.,67,,
294,0.97,3532.228,3541.938,"I appreciate the way this is constructive, the narrative, the summary table by recommendation and the final attachment which is a summary table by which option each items fall into.",67,,
295,0.97,3541.938,3547.11,Great response and again not seeing any questions.,67,,
296,0.97,3547.11,3594.19,"I would reiterate for the last priest, I know we have heard a lot from members of the portable benefits coalition with interest and not just having Los do the work themselves or having the city and central staff to the work itself but really wanting a joint partnership with Stakeholders so the policy is developed in tandem looking at places like Philadelphia and one of the concerns was they did not want to model that with the Department going away coming up with policy and then revealing so this REITERATES joint partnership throughout 2022 to develop policy helps Streich the right balance.",67,,
297,0.97,3594.19,3595.892,Any questions on this letter?,67,,
298,0.97,3595.892,3608.972,Okay at this moment I would like to have the clerk called the roll for Councilmembers who wish to sign on for the domestic worker standards response letter.,67,,
299,0.97,3608.972,3619.349,[calling names],68,,
300,0.97,3620.383,3627.924,That is the four Councilmembers that wish to sign on.,69,,
301,0.97,3627.924,3633.129,Thank you very much we will finalize the letter and have the translated Spanish version as well.,70,,
302,0.97,3633.129,3648.111,"I will do one Final-Round to other Councilmembers as suggested, if any additional members would like to sign their name we would welcome that.",70,,
303,0.97,3648.111,3654.717,It is my interest in getting this out as quickly as possible so for members of the domestic workers standard board do NOTE the letters on its way to your.,70,,
304,0.97,3654.717,3661.257,Great work appreciate your time on this item as well as LORI from our office.,70,,
305,0.97,3661.257,3664.227,Much appreciated.,70,,
306,0.97,3664.227,3667.263,Let's move on to item number two.,70,,
307,0.97,3667.263,3686.783,Item number two Council bill 120131 ordinance amending ordinance 126237 which adopted the 2021 budget for various departments . brief discussion possible vote.,71,,
308,0.97,3686.783,3698.261,I want to welcome to the table the director from central staff thank you very much for being with us Dan Eder.,72,,
309,0.97,3698.261,3704.434,This is the second time we had a chance to talk about this in committee.,72,,
310,0.97,3704.434,3721.818,We had multiple conversations about the Eci and the task force in the last year in this Committee and this is the opportunity to move forward on the recommendations we heard directly from the task force.,72,,
311,0.97,3721.818,3728.724,So to put this item in front of us I'm going to move the passage of the bill so it is in front of us for discussion.,72,,
312,0.97,3728.724,3733.496,There are two amendments to consider after we do some conversation.,72,,
313,0.97,3733.496,3738.835,Recommend passage of Council bill 120131.,72,,
314,0.97,3738.835,3741.637,Thank you very much.,72,,
315,0.97,3741.637,3752.448,Noted and second that the bill be in front of us before we consider amendments would you like to walk through any orientation of the legislation?,72,,
316,0.97,3752.448,3755.952,"Yes, think your chair I would be happy to do that.",73,,
317,0.97,3755.952,3761.624,Good morning for the record Dan Eder with Council and central staff.,73,,
318,0.97,3761.624,3768.064,As you mentioned Council bill 121-0131 with two categories of things.,73,,
319,0.97,3768.064,3780.376,First lifting a pair of provisions imposed as spending restrictions on the budget for the equitable community initiative or Eci task force.,73,,
320,0.97,3780.376,3798.294,The second category is that it would move $30 million in appropriations from Finance general to the budgets of the departments that will implement recommendations from the Eci task force.,73,,
321,0.97,3798.294,3818.614,"I will spend a couple of minutes highlighting information from a staff memo posted to today's agenda and I want to thank many members of the central staff team even though my name is on it, it was a group effort so thank you to the central staff team for their support on pulling the memo together.",73,,
322,0.97,3818.614,3836.933,"By way of quick background, the 2021 adopted budget included significant investments to address systemic and government sanctioned racism by improving outcomes for black, indigenous and people of color communities.",73,,
323,0.97,3836.933,3857.52,In particular the 2021 adopted budget included $29.9 million to be guided by the Eci task force recommendations and another $28.3 million to be guided by recommendations from a Participatory budgeting process.,73,,
324,0.97,3857.52,3867.663,In 2020 last year the Council allocated the additional $3 million for contract with the freedom project.,73,,
325,0.97,3867.663,3881.077,The so-called black brilliance research projects report has informed the design of the Participatory budgeting process which is ongoing.,73,,
326,0.97,3881.077,3905.401,"As the chair mentioned a couple weeks ago the Finance and housing committee heard a presentation from Eci task force members about how to spend $30 million on major investments, the Eci task force members were all appointed by the Mayor and it is worth noting the Councilmember is a member of the Eci task force.",73,,
327,0.97,3905.401,3916.279,"So, the memo walks through six policy considerations that are issues that we thought were worth highlighting as we consider the proposed bill.",73,,
328,0.97,3916.279,3927.723,Some of the issues will need to be resolved during implementation of the recommendations assuming that you approve the Council bill 120131.,73,,
329,0.97,3927.723,3938.234,Others would need to be addressed when Council takes up the proposed budget this fall.,73,,
330,0.97,3938.234,3948.911,So I will breeze through the six issues but please feel free to stop me with questions if you want to have discussion happy to stop at any point.,73,,
331,0.97,3948.911,3954.517,Issue number one in the memo is coordination question.,73,,
332,0.97,3954.517,3969.332,Council expressed interest in having the Eci test force and Participatory budgeting move Forwardtogether in a coordinated fashion and one of the supervisors lifted by the bill has a statement to that effect.,73,,
333,0.97,3969.332,3982.745,Staff memo notes that the bill would effectively move forward the Eci task force recommendations on a separate track from and ahead of the Participatory budgeting process.,73,,
334,0.97,3982.745,3990.386,We don't think that is a Showstopper but wanted to call that to your attention.,73,,
335,0.97,3990.386,3994.69,Unless there are questions just going to continue on.,73,,
336,0.97,3994.69,4017.88,Item number two is the amount of funding included in the bill Council bill 120131 would appropriate $30 million in 2021 for the Eci task force even though the adopted budget included a somewhat smaller amount in particular $29.9 million.,73,,
337,0.97,4017.88,4051.013,"Cbo reports the $100,000 of additional funding the difference between the budget 29.9 million and the spill appropriation was $30 million, the extra $100,000 comes from anticipated under spending on other finance general reserves if not spent on the Eci task force recommendations this $100,000 under spend would otherwise be available to support different spending priorities.",73,,
338,0.97,4051.013,4053.849,So just a question of opportunity cost.,73,,
339,0.97,4053.849,4055.718,I will continue on.,73,,
340,0.97,4055.718,4078.04,"Item number three is staffing and administrative costs, the executive has committed to use existing staffing to the extent possible to do administration and oversight of how the money gets from the city to a series of community investments.",73,,
341,0.97,4078.04,4106.502,This approach is expected to minimize how much of the $30 million needs to be spent on city administration but it is possible some share of the $30 million would be needed for this purpose meaning in all likelihood not every penny of the $30 million will be available for direct programming and specific amounts are to be determined.,73,,
342,0.97,4106.502,4111.807,The fourth issue raised in the memo is ongoing funding.,73,,
343,0.97,4111.807,4133.796,The Eci task force recommendations explicitly assume ongoing investments beyond 2021 and a number of the programs would only make sense to stand up if the programs will continue in 2022 and beyond.,73,,
344,0.97,4133.796,4140.336,It is not yet clear what the source of funding will be to support ongoing program investments beginning in 2022.,73,,
345,0.97,4140.336,4149.145,This is one of the issues that will need to be resolved when the Council takes up the 2022 proposed budget.,73,,
346,0.97,4149.145,4164.56,"Let's get through the next items identified and then I will call folks, one Councilmember with a question so we will come to you first.",74,,
347,0.97,4164.56,4172.635,Second to last is item number five legal constraints.,75,,
348,0.97,4172.635,4184.98,Earlier this year the deputy Mayor sent a letter to Council identifying potential implementation concerns with what was then being considered for funding a Participatory budgeting process.,75,,
349,0.97,4184.98,4194.256,And I would draw your attention to the attachment one on the central staff memo which is that letter from the deputy Mayor Washington.,75,,
350,0.97,4194.256,4207.403,"In particular the letter indicates need to ensure the investments comply with legal impact of contracting, hiring, I 200 and the gift of public funds.",75,,
351,0.97,4207.403,4217.279,The city will need to live within the same constraints should it move forward with programs funded through the Eci task force recommendations in this Council bill.,75,,
352,0.97,4217.279,4227.823,I believe as Councilmember chair Mosqueda Referenced in her opening remarks there are two amendments related to this issue.,75,,
353,0.97,4227.823,4231.126,The last item is timing.,75,,
354,0.97,4231.126,4246.709,My understanding of some of the investments would require request for proposal to select particularly community organizations who could not accept city funding and implement programs.,75,,
355,0.97,4246.709,4277.273,This process could take longer than the end of the calendar year for Expending the money authorized under the bill and as a result and forcing the possibility the bill includes language that would carry forward any unspent portions of the $30 million included in the Council bill and that concludes my summary of issues and background.,75,,
356,0.97,4277.273,4279.675,Happy to address any questions.,75,,
357,0.97,4279.675,4284.279,Thank you for the memo and thank you for walking us through this.,76,,
358,0.97,4284.279,4286.548,Please go ahead.,76,,
359,0.97,4286.548,4302.598,"It sounds, I think I know the answer but it sounds like we don't have any estimate at all at this point for the administrative costs for these investments is that the case?",77,,
360,0.97,4302.598,4325.387,"Secondly, I am pretty sure I heard it described that some of these investments it would not make sense to fund for a single year so in essence by approving the action we are making a commitment to funding beyond this year.",77,,
361,0.97,4325.387,4327.523,Would that be accurate?,77,,
362,0.97,4327.523,4330.292,Thank you.,77,,
363,0.97,4330.292,4339.535,In terms of the first question the estimate of administrative costs I have heard a ballpark of 5 to 10%.,78,,
364,0.97,4339.535,4361.123,Not clear if that is particular to this $30 million slice of money or if that is based on past experience but that gives you an order of magnitude expectation of how much of the money would need to be spent on city staffing and related process costs.,78,,
365,0.97,4361.123,4376.572,So that is on the order of 1.5 to $3 million out of $30 million and the balance of which would be available to make direct investments in community organizations.,78,,
366,0.97,4376.572,4420.282,"In terms of making a commitment I suppose that is, I guess you know legally speaking you would not be making a commitment, yes I think the general idea is if you approve the funding it would make sense for you to also improve ongoing funding for the assisted initial $30 million but you will have more information when the Mayor proposes her budget this fall, including an updated look at the revenues that are available for all city purposes including these.",78,,
367,0.97,4420.282,4438.834,Certainly it is possible while it might not be ideal to have some of the programs start and stop if you find yourself in financial Straits there are all kinds of things you wouldn't want to do that you may have to in that circumstance.,78,,
368,0.97,4438.834,4448.243,I do think it is a Livewire that Council will have to take up during the fall budget process.,78,,
369,0.97,4448.243,4454.249,Thank you.,79,,
370,0.97,4454.249,4456.552,Thank you so much.,80,,
371,0.97,4456.552,4460.456,Any additional questions?,80,,
372,0.97,4460.456,4467.429,Thank you for the question I think that is an important point.,80,,
373,0.97,4467.429,4471.533,Dan do you mind summarizing both Amendmnts in front of us for today?,80,,
374,0.97,4471.533,4487.149,"Sure, happy to do that what is labeled amendment number one would add a new section to the bill with findings about ongoing disparities and a declaration on city intend to remedy those disparities.",81,,
375,0.97,4487.149,4512.007,"What is labeled amendment two would add a new section to the bill Memorializing Council intent the implementation steps be consistent with all applicable legal, both of these in response to the legal constraints question sorry issue that I highlighted as number five.",81,,
376,0.97,4512.007,4514.91,In the staff memo.,81,,
377,0.97,4514.91,4521.016,"Thank you, questions on either amend its before we get through them?",82,,
378,0.97,4521.016,4527.322,Not seeing any questions on the human it's.,82,,
379,0.97,4527.322,4529.524,Thank you for walking us through that summary.,82,,
380,0.97,4529.524,4533.929,"Colleagues, please go ahead.",82,,
381,0.97,4533.929,4539.635,Sorry I have a follow-up question . administrative cost issue.,83,,
382,0.97,4539.635,4558.353,"What I understand to be language from the memo, these administered of costs are paid from the 30 million proposed to be spent in the balance would be available for direct spending investment?",83,,
383,0.97,4558.353,4631.693,"So we don't know whether or not administrative costs are going to be paid for with the $30 million and I guess I am Positing a little bit about that because I want to make sure we are being, you know if the order of magnitude that you identified is some other bigger number and it does not come out of the $30 million it potentially would come from somewhere else and if it does come out of the $30 million that is an issue of expectation setting for the community on how many dollars will actually go out the door and it would help me a lot if we had a little bit more certainty around the issue and maybe that is something we can work on between now and full council if folks agree that we should try to create some clarity around the Council expectations so we can in turn create certainty for public expectations?",83,,
384,0.97,4631.693,4639.901,I would be happy to follow up with the city budget office to try to get additional information about their plans.,84,,
385,0.97,4639.901,4657.953,"One option which I would tea up for consideration is you could as we have done in some others, set up a cap of how much of the funding at the top end could be used for that purpose.",84,,
386,0.97,4657.953,4679.241,"I think one of the potential Downsides of doing so is that could set a target that gives the, the executive a sense that the Council would be okay spending up to that maximum amount whereas it might otherwise be a smaller amount.",84,,
387,0.97,4679.241,4692.087,I don't know that that is a perfect answer there it would be an easy amendment that I can work up for your consideration and you might consider if you want to move forward.,84,,
388,0.97,4692.087,4705.6,My interest is less to do was setting a cap and more about having some clarity about where the cost comes from.,85,,
389,0.97,4705.6,4709.704,Do we expect the total $30 million to be reduced?,85,,
390,0.97,4709.704,4745.907,That's another way of thinking of the cap potentially but if the expectation is that the funds for the administered of costs associated with this investment come from the $30 million it feels to me like we should be saying that and if not if we expect the executive to find another source to pay for those costs it feels like we should be more clear about that as well.,85,,
391,0.97,4745.907,4755.45,Sorry folks have a sick Kiddo here at home today.,86,,
392,0.97,4755.45,4780.976,I also think that Dovetails nicely with the issue identified in number two and Councilmember Herbold has interest in trying to address this before the full council meeting that might be another way to ensure if there are cost savings that is something to contribute to the administrative solutions.,86,,
393,0.97,4780.976,4783.145,Are there any additional questions?,86,,
394,0.97,4786.414,4793.955,Okay Councilmember Herbold appreciate you flagging that and will do additional work before Monday.,86,,
395,0.97,4793.955,4815.31,Not hearing an objection to moving forward today with considering these amendments or the underlying bill and really again appreciate your Walk- through of this analysis with us and of course members of the task force who have been working on this over the last eight months or so and appreciate the presentation last week.,86,,
396,0.97,4815.31,4828.924,Excited to make sure these dollars like the others would have allocated both in the 2021 budget process and also for Seattle rescue plan dollars truly are getting into the hands of people that we have said they will get to.,86,,
397,0.97,4828.924,4834.93,Excited to see these dollars be Prioritized and hope that we can move quickly to get the mother door.,86,,
398,0.97,4834.93,4839.634,Appreciate the amendments in front of us helping us to accomplish greater transparency in this effort.,86,,
399,0.97,4839.634,4893.255,"So I will move the amendment in front of us it has been moved already to consider Council bill 120131 and in front of us we have amendment number one, amendment number one establishes the city knowledge is the effect of past racism and is setting for to address the disproportionate effects on these communities the work of the equitable community task force and forthcoming budgetary process is an effort to change the way we as a city invest in communities and I look forward to seeing those investments changing material conditions for people's lives in order to see that I move amendment I moved to amend Council bill 120131 as presented amendment number one second?",86,,

410,0.97,4950.111,4971.166,Since we are dealing with legal limitations in the way the city can Disseminate money because of things like initiative 200 this amendment recognizes the city must live within a legal constraint that has moving forward with making investments and that we are following all the necessary recommendations to be consistent with all legal applicable limitations.,91,,
411,0.97,4971.166,4974.269,Any additional questions or comments?,91,,

441,0.97,5158.653,5167.462,Julie with the city budgets office and Teresa Radcliffe was central staff thank you all for being here today.,101,,
442,0.97,5167.462,5214.208,"As you will recall this item was first part of our agenda last meeting and we had a chance to see those materials presented on the agenda and did not get a chance to walk through them in detail but there is some great opportunity as I'm calling this to address some trailer bills from the Federal Government that allow for us to make some really important investments into Seattle's community specifically related to senior care, some narrow transportation investments and additional rental assistance that is much-needed relief for Renters, tenants and/or small landlords who rely on tenant rental payments to sustain themselves as well.",101,,
443,0.97,5214.208,5224.085,"Excited about the opportunity today, this is a follow-up to the Seattle rescue plan which was Council bill 120093 along with 120094.",101,,

446,0.97,5266.761,5283.911,"So I'll turn it over to our team, for the presentation and look forward to hearing any questions or comments you have, I'm not aware of any amendments today so my hope is that after we hear this presentation we could potentially entertain a motion to move this out of committee.",101,,

448,0.97,5286.08,5289.083,"Thank you, Aly Pennucci.",102,,

450,0.97,5291.552,5302.296,"Morales two, Aly Pennucci, and I will present as we move through the slides to save some time here.",103,,
451,0.97,5302.296,5309.804,Today we will be discussing counsel bill 120150 the Seattle rescue plan number two.,103,,
452,0.97,5309.804,5348.209,"Followed by very brief background information and then we will Walk-Through the proposal in the bill, I'm not going to spend a lot of time walking through the background on the Seattle rescue plan, number one they just described it in detail but justly recently the first package appropriated funds, I merely direct aid received for Coronavirus local fiscal recovery funds, provided flexible funding to governments and the bill is taking up some of the targeted aid that is proposed for specific purposes such as emergency rental assistance.",103,,
453,0.97,5348.209,5374.769,"So at the time the Council was passing the Seattle rescue plan, one, this committee anticipated a second rescue package this summer to accept and authorize the funding for targeted aid and that's what before you today and we are anticipating there may be some additional targeted aid that could be considered as part of the fall budget process as well as consideration of the second--local fiscal recovery funds.",103,,
454,0.97,5374.769,5391.486,"So this bill would accept and authorize spending over $50 million in targeted aid for rental assistance programs and support for seniors, transportation services and a grant for--.",103,,
455,0.97,5391.486,5402.964,This includes funding that was authorized through the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 passed by Congress in December 2020 appropriations act of 2021 passed by Congress in December 2024 transportation spending.,103,,
456,0.97,5402.964,5405.333,The remaining funds are targeted aid that were included.,103,,
457,0.97,5405.333,5418.446,With that I will now pass it over to director Alvarado to provide background information and describe the current proposal for allocating emergency rental assistance funds that the city has received.,103,,
458,0.97,5418.446,5420.014,Thank you.,104,,
459,0.97,5420.014,5430.758,"Hello, I am Emily over auto director of the city's housing and I will very briefly discuss how we have been implement in E.R.A.",104,,
460,0.97,5430.758,5440.835,"One which was the first tranche of Federal rental assistance spending and how we propose to continue these investments with E.R.A., too.",104,,
461,0.97,5440.835,5467.428,"As you recall the last investment of rental assessment, assistance was $27.2 million and we took a four-part strategy, first was to put 6.2 million into Community-Based organizations who are really working within their network to provide rental assistance and supports for low income Renters.",104,,
462,0.97,5467.428,5482.276,Really the emphasis with those community groups was to focus on organizations that have strong relationships with folks who are disproportionately impacted by Covid-19 and disproportionately impacted by housing instability.,104,,
463,0.97,5482.276,5505.6,"We invested $8 million in United way of King County, that was Leveraging investments made by King county in their individual tenant pool and also invested $7 million through our office to support tenants in publicly subsidized affordable housing with a priority on really supporting those with the lowest income in our city.",104,,
464,0.97,5505.6,5507.668,There was also a $1.5 million allocation from the E.R.A.,104,,
465,0.97,5507.668,5516.41,One to city light or utility assistance.,104,,
466,0.97,5516.41,5537.732,"To give a brief update on how we've been doing on investing those resources, and I'm sorry this is not consistent with the ordering of the last slide, but for the Community-Based organizations we have executed contracts with 14 Community- based organizations out of 16.",105,,
467,0.97,5537.732,5542.203,"We did do a formalized Rfp process to select those organizations, we are really proud of the groups we are working with.",105,,
468,0.97,5542.203,5551.746,Over 90% of the funds are committed and awarded through contracts and those community organizations are currently working with clients to deliver rent assistance and services.,105,,
469,0.97,5551.746,5572.266,"In particular I wanted to flag that because of the diversity of groups who we are Partnering with, we are really able to target some specific populations, for example some of the groups have expertise serving households with children and I know there's a lot of interest by counsel and all of us to ensure that we are stabilizing families prior to the school year.",105,,
470,0.97,5572.266,5585.346,"Second for the investment in the United way of King County we are really moving quickly at this point, United way has spent 3 million of the funds that they've received, they are supporting around 300 households.",105,,
471,0.97,5585.346,5597.458,"If you do the rough math you will notice that that is significantly more than we thought we would be spending per household, about $10,000 in rental assistance.",105,,
472,0.97,5597.458,5610.004,Really demonstrates both the need and depth of need per household and also shows why we need more resources so that we can serve more households.,105,,
473,0.97,5610.004,5623.618,United way is currently working with an additional 500 households through the application process and we anticipate that that will fully expend all of the resource that they have meaning that they will be out of the first allocation in the coming weeks and prepared for additional investment.,105,,
474,0.97,5623.618,5641.936,"In the office of housing support portfolio, we have first an initial process to demonstrate that the need was over 6 million.",105,,
475,0.97,5641.936,5654.949,"We anticipate serving over 3000 households, those households are already being entered into our data system and we've begun payments initially first with the smallest, over 30 different organizations are being worked with and we are making payments first to the smallest and expect to make all of our payments the end of August.",105,,
476,0.97,5654.949,5666.46,Meaning that we really will be prepared to start spending this next tranche of funds.,105,,
477,0.97,5666.46,5677.872,"I do want to say to other things that I should've mentioned, the United way of King County is serving primarily folks who are tenants in buildings of small landlords so they are primarily tenants in buildings that have for or fewer tenants.",105,,
478,0.97,5677.872,5696.457,And Additionally we are grateful to the United way of King County who has created a separate system by which small landlords in Seattle can reach out to them and get technical assistance and support and acting as an intermediary to get tenants to apply for the resources.,105,,
479,0.97,5696.457,5698.392,So thanks to United way for doing that extra work.,105,,
480,0.97,5698.392,5700.094,Next slide please.,105,,
481,0.97,5700.094,5718.712,"Just a representation of the community organizations that we are working with, as you can see there we have a mix of groups who both have a long history and track record in providing rental assistance and others for whom this is one of the first Federal contracts they are working on.",106,,
482,0.97,5718.712,5722.416,Just to name a few you see Atlantic one of the first Federal contracts they are working on.,106,,
483,0.97,5722.416,5738.399,"Just to name a few you see Atlantic St., center, choose 180, and we are excited about the work they are doing, we are hearing really positive stories from these organizations who are already working with clients.",106,,
484,0.97,5738.399,5747.942,"So building off of that system that we've developed, we are proposing for this next $28.7 million of emergency rental assistance to be similarly administered through the three approaches.",106,,
485,0.97,5747.942,5766.46,One would put 9.6 million to continuing investments in Community-Based organizations which would likely include extended contracts with many of the groups that we already mentioned and might include additional contacts if there were any populations or existing gaps that we would like to fill.,106,,
486,0.97,5766.46,5775.369,"9.6 million to continue investments to United way of King County as I mentioned, they'll be ready to start spending again in the next couple of weeks.",106,,
487,0.97,5775.369,5797.358,"And 9.6 million to continue investments through the office of housing for publicly subsidized affordable housing, our data shows that there will be the need toward that in the portfolio since the last 6 million only helped support tenants through may of this year.",106,,
488,0.97,5797.358,5805.166,I should just finally say that the work the team has done to put out the rental assistance to date has been really incredible.,106,,
489,0.97,5805.166,5835.429,"We also know that we hear Anecdotally from King County that they have over 25,000 households with an indication that they have any for rental assistance so even combined with this resource, there is a Signifiant resource needed to meet the need and we look forward to getting it out in the hands of tenants as quickly as possible to make sure that people remain Stably housed as we move past the expiration of the other fiction moratorium.",106,,
490,0.97,5835.429,5842.403,"Thank you Ms. Alvarado, would you like us to go through the entire proposal?",107,,
491,0.97,5842.403,5848.509,So the next piece of the Seattle rescue plan is funding to support seniors.,107,,
492,0.97,5848.509,5867.161,The city has received over $7 million of older American act funds that have some allocation from the state to the human services departments engaging in disability services which is the area agency for aging of all of King County.,107,,
493,0.97,5867.161,5881.575,"These funds can be used for senior supportive services,, get meals, home delivered meals, family care, and to address social isolation which was an expanded eligible use of the funds as part of the Covid relief efforts of the Federal Government.",107,,
494,0.97,5881.575,5890.985,The city anticipates about $3.1 million in the first year and will spend remaining funds through 2024.,107,,
495,0.97,5890.985,5941.802,"The city is still awaiting final guidance from the state that will dictate what Hsd can specifically use the funds for, in those broader eligibility categories and because we are waiting those--and use of the funds that is consistent with the eligibility described in--and includes a proviso to ensure at least some funds are specifically reserved for services to--the proviso also requests that the human services Department submit to more details to the Council after receiving additional guidance from the state, we are anticipating this will be submitted this fall and that could inform the Council's budget deliberations this fall and make any adjustments as needed.",107,,
496,0.97,5941.802,5950.544,If the guidance is not received in time for when the Mayor is transmitting the proposed budget we will work with the Department to get that information to Councilmembers.,107,,
497,0.97,5950.544,5951.512,As soon as it's available.,107,,
498,0.97,5951.512,5955.349,I saw a question on the slide.,108,,
499,0.97,5955.349,5973.467,"Not a question, I want to, thank--for working with my office to make sure this legislation to this proviso specifically addresses the mental health impacts of the pandemic on seniors.",109,,
500,0.97,5973.467,6009.002,"I think folks are aware that this has long been a priority of mine, last summer I added funds to the human services Department budget to combat senior isolation and the mental health impacts of the pandemic on seniors, I added this focus to Council resolution 31999 which outlines the priorities for the funds and I have reached out to both the Mayor's office and Hsd to let them know that I'm really interested in working Collaboratively to ensure that the funds are focused on mental health.",109,,
501,0.97,6009.002,6018.512,I understand from the budget office that these funds may be spent on impacts of senior isolation which is a new area of focus added due to the effects of Covid.,109,,
502,0.97,6018.512,6033.327,And that we are still waiting for specific state guidance on how we can use these funds to address the impacts of senior isolation and ensure that that does include mental health.,109,,
503,0.97,6033.327,6061.922,"The proviso is Crafted in such a way that $200,000 of the funding, unless we find out that the state guidance Precludes that use, and I want to just flag also that though I understand that this action before us appropriates all 7.7 million in funding for seniors, only 3.1 million will be distributed in 2021.",109,,
504,0.97,6061.922,6071.465,So that ensures that I will be continuing my inquiries into the plan for these funds in 2022 as well.,109,,
505,0.97,6071.465,6071.799,Thank you.,109,,
506,0.97,6071.799,6091.452,"Thank you vice chair, well said we appreciate your leadership and reminding folks about the shadow of the pandemic resolution--sent a pretty lengthy list of requests that we are still hopeful will be included in the 2022 budget as transmitted to Council.",110,,
507,0.97,6091.452,6131.859,"We did have an opportunity to come through that and see if there were any specific items requested in the budget request that could be fulfilled by these Federal dollars and given what was just said about the upcoming clarification and guidance that will be issued soon I appreciate this hold that we have here, that is intent language that will help reference back to those priorities if we get the Go-Ahead to spend them that way and if not as counsel Lisa Herbold just noted we will continue to work on this in the 2022 budget process and--.",110,,
508,0.97,6131.859,6133.06,Okay.,110,,
509,0.97,6133.06,6163.59,"Thank you, before turning over to my colleague Julie Dingley for the next categories I want to highlight the intent, after coming to the letter you just Referenced we did include a specific idea that was included in that letter around hybrid meal programs that allows for a different model of home delivery and that sort of thing so that is in there and we will look forward to specific puzzles in the 2022 proposed budget.",111,,
510,0.97,6163.59,6176.57,With that I pass it over to Julie Dingley from the city budget office to describe some of the proposals for transportation services and projects and--.,111,,
511,0.97,6176.57,6189.316,"Thank you alley, good morning committee members, I'm Julie Dingley with the city budget office, on transportation we expect about 13.5 million to come from two different sources.",112,,
512,0.97,6189.316,6201.028,"-- which we talked about previously from FTA, Federal transportation agency and the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 passed in late December of passed in late December 2020.",112,,
513,0.97,6201.028,6224.284,"We will be receiving that 13.5, about 10.9 for the Madison Street transit and this will fund a 2.3 mile East-West BART line from Madison street to downtown Seattle to the--neighborhood in the East with connections at--.",112,,
514,0.97,6224.284,6233.827,"The next item we will be receiving 785,000 for streetcars to Backfill lost revenue and support units and operations overall.",112,,
515,0.97,6233.827,6243.804,Then we are going to be receiving 1.8 million for Seattle center for Monorail to Backfill lost revenue and to support maintenance and operations.,112,,
516,0.97,6243.804,6277.17,"Then we are also going to be receiving a grant to support--for 2.1 million and this is coming from the small business administration's shuttered menu operators grant, something the city applied for and we were awarded so it is specifically for--hall and can be used for expenses such as payroll, utilities or payments and other business expenses and business costs.",112,,
517,0.97,6277.738,6280.107,"Thank you Julie, are there questions on those categories?",113,,
518,0.97,6280.107,6307.167,"I do want to note for my colleagues here on the previous two slides, slides eight and nine regarding transportation investments and the--slides on slide nine, this is very prescriptive funding that the Federal Government, that we are receiving as a Pass-Through basically from the city.",114,,
519,0.97,6307.167,6316.51,"I know there's a lot of needs that we have both for transportation infrastructure and for various businesses, not just downtown but across the city and I want to let folks no that on the slides this is very prescriptive--if a permit to say.",114,,
520,0.97,6316.51,6321.381,Thank you.,115,,
521,0.97,6321.381,6324.618,So to the limitations on whether could be flex ability on how those dollars are spent.,115,,
522,0.97,6324.618,6326.286,"Such a good point, thank you very much.",116,,
523,0.97,6326.286,6350.243,"I'll just NOTE on the--the grant from the small business Association there are other local Venues that have applied and received awards and we can Download that list, they have to apply directly but it is not something that would pass through the city but if people are interested I could distribute that.",117,,
524,0.97,6350.243,6357.951,"But with that it wraps up the description of the Seattle rescue plan number two, about $52 million in targeted grants.",117,,
525,0.97,6357.951,6379.473,"So the next steps if the committee votes on this bill today, we would expect final action at full Council on August 9 and as I noted previously the additional target date is received and we would expect that to be considered as part of the fall budget process.",117,,
526,0.97,6379.473,6383.143,"Excellent, thank you all very much for the presentation.",118,,
527,0.97,6383.143,6386.346,We appreciate your time and walking us through this.,118,,
528,0.97,6386.346,6400.794,"Colleagues, while I have the slides up let's go back to manage all of the logos for you community partners, Ms. Alvarado, slide five thank you.",118,,
529,0.97,6400.794,6431.091,"Just for the viewing public and for our cancel polling's I want people to also take note that these community organizations, they can do a screening and an assessment if somebody needs more than just rental assistance and they need Internet assistance or they need utility assistance, these organizations are equipped and empowered to decide how to help those individuals really keep a roof over their head.",118,,
530,0.97,6431.091,6448.141,"That is something really exciting to remember and I want to thank the community partners again one thing I think is important for this allotment, related to rental assistance dollars, we are equally funding the three entities, so that there is greater parity of how we spend those dollars.",118,,
531,0.97,6448.141,6451.344,Councilman morale us please go ahead.,118,,
532,0.97,6451.344,6452.813,Thank you.,119,,
533,0.97,6452.813,6462.155,I really appreciate the slide and your explanation of how the funding will be divided.,119,,
534,0.97,6462.155,6482.042,"I know we've been hearing a lot about how complex some of these processes are and I'm glad to hear that United way is dealing with small landlords, we are hearing a lot also about whether small limits are getting the kind of support they need.",119,,
535,0.97,6482.042,6501.394,"But I wonder if you can talk a little bit about, first I'm curious if there's information on how many months of support householder getting, I'm assuming people need more than one but I would like to know a little more about how much, for how many months they are getting rental assistance.",119,,
536,0.97,6501.394,6514.307,"And then I would like to hear a little bit about the complexity of how people access this, whether it is technology barriers or having to fill out a lot of documentation and paperwork.",119,,
537,0.97,6514.307,6525.519,"If that is something that we are experiencing, and if so what are we doing to try to mitigate that and make the process a little smoother for folks to access?",119,,
538,0.97,6525.519,6542.135,"Thank you for those questions Councilmember morale us, first of all I've been having a follow-up, I don't have an average number of months that United way is paying but as I mentioned they are paying approximately $10,000 per household.",120,,
539,0.97,6542.135,6548.842,"Which, given what average market rate rents are suggests that they are paying several months of rent.",120,,
540,0.97,6548.842,6587.881,"Under er a one the rules are that you can pay I believe up to a year of background and three months of prospective rent and we can pay up to, with er a two weekend--we know Anecdotally from the portfolio of publicly subsidized housing as well that for many folks we will be paying support looking backwards on 2021 and then we anticipate that some of those same households will then come in for E.R.A.",120,,
541,0.97,6587.881,6592.352,To to pay the next few months.,120,,
542,0.97,6592.352,6598.058,For many households it has not been one or two months but it has been more than that.,120,,
543,0.97,6598.058,6605.565,"On the second question you asked about access, access is something that we care a lot about.",120,,
544,0.97,6605.565,6613.506,"Full transparency, this is a Federal program which means there is documentation that is required.",120,,
545,0.97,6613.506,6628.088,There is self certification and income documentation and then in fact one of the other critical pieces is that the tenant must affirmatively say that they want this assistance which happens through a signing of an application.,120,,
546,0.97,6628.088,6646.806,"In order to limit those barriers that exist we really think that the Community-Based organization approach helps people, in fact many of these providers are doing functionally paste management to support tenants in applying for the program themselves in the E.R.A.",120,,
547,0.97,6646.806,6658.351,Does allow up to 15% of administrative costs to be spot supported for those organizations so they can help clients in that way.,120,,
548,0.97,6658.351,6698.591,"I'd also save for the publicly subsidized housing, the affordable housing landlords are entering information on behalf of tenants and then tenants are signing an application which helps to reduce barriers for those tenants and then for the United way, tenants are entering United way to the King County individual tenant cool, there is documentation that happens there but United way works with Community-Based groups, to, to have a back and forth with tenants to ensure that they are able to get all of their documents in.",120,,
549,0.97,6698.591,6710.17,"That takes time, it does take several weeks to help make sure that tenants can collect all of their information but we've tried to make it as low barrier as possible by working with Community-Based organizations.",120,,
550,0.97,6710.17,6712.972,I have one more question.,121,,
551,0.97,6712.972,6724.217,"So, I hear you saying that landlords are getting some technical assistance help but are they able to apply directly themselves rather than relying on the tenants to do that?",121,,
552,0.97,6724.217,6731.291,"And can they apply, or is it really tied to the tenant?",121,,
553,0.97,6731.291,6731.925,Good question.,122,,
554,0.97,6731.925,6741.634,"Under the Federal Treasury guidance, for these resources, the tenant must formally apply.",122,,
555,0.97,6741.634,6754.647,So the landlord can take some steps to facilitate application on behalf of their tenants but ultimately the tenant needs to be the one who is submitting a formal application.,122,,
556,0.97,6754.647,6770.063,"As I mentioned earlier, one of the things that we are doing to help mitigate any potential concerns on behalf of landlords that their tenants are not Accessing the resource, is that we've set up this program three United way.",122,,
557,0.97,6770.063,6780.473,Concerned landlords can contact United way and United way staff is contacting tenants on behalf of their landlords and working with them to submit applications.,122,,
558,0.97,6780.473,6791.584,But it is true that ultimately the tenant must take some affirmative step in order to access the resource per Federal guidelines.,122,,
559,0.97,6791.584,6792.385,Okay.,123,,
560,0.97,6792.385,6793.386,Thank you.,123,,
561,0.97,6793.386,6833.827,"Thank you, Councilmember Tammy J. Morales had some important comments during yesterday's morning briefing reminding folks about the difference here in Seattle and our continuation of the Eviction moratorium along with wanting to remind people about the ongoing ability to get rental assistance, both the tenants and small landlords, if there is any information that your office has to help clarify for folks the ways in which Seattle policy remains in place and the ways in which people can access rental assistance, that would be helpful and I think there's a lot of interest in sharing that information out given the National coverage of the Federal Eviction moratorium going away.",124,,
562,0.97,6833.827,6842.535,I don't want there to be any misunderstandings about the protections that folks have here but also the assistance that we have for small landlords and Renters.,124,,
563,0.97,6842.535,6846.039,Councilmember Lisa Herbold?,124,,
564,0.97,6846.039,6847.707,Following up on Councilmember Tammy J.,125,,
565,0.97,6847.707,6873.466,"Morales's question, we had actually stood, we set up this portal for landlords to access assistance and facilitating the application for tenants who for whatever reason may not be applying for assistance that they are eligible to receive.",125,,
566,0.97,6873.466,6903.162,"We had been hearing, I don't believe this is happening on a large scale but we have been hearing from individual landlords that some tenants are both not paying rent and appear not to be applying for assistance so we really appreciate your working with the United way to set up this portal for landlords and this extra assistance in sort of facilitating those applications.",125,,
567,0.97,6903.162,6909.002,"I would be very interested to know though, how it's going.",125,,
568,0.97,6909.002,6920.68,And I understand you may not have that information now but are landlords in this situation using the resources being provide?,125,,
569,0.97,6920.68,6928.721,And are tenants being responsive to the engagement and outreach to encourage them to apply?,125,,
570,0.97,6928.721,6929.589,Thank you.,125,,
571,0.97,6929.589,6946.839,"I can say Councilmember Lisa Herbold, I want to acknowledge, thank you for communications from your office which did lead to helping to ensure that we set up this effective program that United way.",126,,
572,0.97,6946.839,6956.149,They have been serving landlords I think in my last count they served at least 30 landlords that I'll be happy to follow up with Council members and get some more up-to-date data.,126,,
573,0.97,6956.149,6971.064,"And Anecdotally what I've heard is that they were able to reach many of the tenants or in fact some of the tenants who the landlords were concerned had not been applying, had already applied under the King County program.",126,,
574,0.97,6971.064,6977.47,So I think it has been a good process of being able to provide that support but I will follow up with more data.,126,,
575,0.97,6977.47,6979.872,"Both excellent questions, thank you very much Council members.",127,,
576,0.97,6979.872,7017.477,"The other piece of information that I received when chatting with our friends that United way is a lot of appreciation for the role that these community partners play and I think there's a recognition--is something that maybe often they don't have, maybe they don't--and having that partner is really important so the community partner investment is truly added to making sure everyone has access to rental assistance dollars so we appreciate your support there.",127,,
577,0.97,7017.477,7039.699,"One of the things that was flagged was the possible need for--funding for community partners to be available to access, can you speak to that, Dr. Alvarado, I think one of the concerns may have been that one of these community organizations had the ability to access funds in real time so that none of the community organizations were going into debt or using existing funds waiting for reimbursement.",127,,
578,0.97,7039.699,7042.702,Can you speak to that whether or not there's a need for--.,127,,
579,0.97,7042.702,7059.752,"It's a good question, and we are really focused on making sure that community organizations can utilize these funds in a sustainable way.",128,,
580,0.97,7059.752,7064.69,We have some limitations based on Federal guidance of the capacity that is needed in the organizations themselves in order to support these payments.,128,,
581,0.97,7064.69,7097.89,"At this point we have not proposed a revolving fund but we have allowed for additional administration support to go to the agencies through that 15% as I mentioned and also we were doing regularly the organizations are able to send us, on every few week cycle, the reimbursements so that we can be really hyper responsive on the reimbursement making sure that they are not sitting out there without that resource for some time.",128,,
582,0.97,7097.89,7115.608,"So having to entertainment concepts of a revolving Fund, we have not proposed that at this time and we are putting a lot of attention into supporting these agencies to make sure they can be successful and sustainable.",128,,
583,0.97,7115.608,7116.209,Okay great.,129,,
584,0.97,7116.209,7136.329,"As we get this additional allotment out for rental assessment can we divided among the three entities and our community partners, please keep us updated on whether or not there is a need for us to work jointly on the revolving fund to make sure that those organizations are successful and what they already did Pre- pandemic and than what we are also adding to the plate--.",129,,
585,0.97,7136.329,7141.2,Is that a carryover hand Councilmember Tammy J. Morales?,129,,
586,0.97,7141.2,7142.802,Did you have additional questions?,129,,
587,0.97,7142.802,7143.836,Okay great.,129,,
588,0.97,7143.836,7152.745,I am not seeing any additional hands and I don't see any additional comments or questions.,129,,
589,0.97,7152.745,7154.947,Is there anything you would like to summarize?,129,,
590,0.97,7154.947,7162.522,"Thank you, I don't have anything to add.",130,,
591,0.97,7162.522,7162.955,Excellent.,131,,
592,0.97,7162.955,7178.971,I appreciate the discussion and all the work and I know this money is going to be much-needed especially in the rental assistance and senior care portion and I also appreciate the narrow scope of the transportation dollars that we have in front of us.,131,,
593,0.97,7178.971,7189.148,"So forgetting these dollars out the door, and we appreciate you addressing the questions that the Councilmembers have brought up.",131,,
594,0.97,7189.148,7192.385,If there is anything for us to put in the 2022 budget or in tranche three.,131,,
595,0.97,7192.385,7204.363,"At this time colleagues I would like to move the committee recommends passage of counsel bill 120150, is there a second?",131,,
596,0.97,7204.363,7206.098,Anybody want to second?,131,,
597,0.97,7206.098,7215.708,It's been moved and Seconded.,132,,
598,0.97,7215.708,7224.216,"This again is our Seattle rescue plan two, the second of three acts, is there any additional comments or questions?",132,,
599,0.97,7224.216,7227.52,Hearing on Mdm.,132,,
600,0.97,7227.52,7229.989,Clerk can you call the role on the passage of the bill?,132,,
601,0.97,7229.989,7256.282,[roll call] Mdm.,133,,
602,0.97,7256.282,7262.722,Chair that is for in favor and none opposed.,133,,
603,0.97,7262.722,7263.889,"Excellent, thank you very much.",134,,
604,0.97,7263.889,7269.762,The motion carries and the committee recommendation that the Seattle rescue plan two bill will be sent to the August 9 Seattle city council meeting for a final vote.,134,,
605,0.97,7269.762,7274.467,I thank you for your presentation and work on this and I know there's much more to come.,134,,
606,0.97,7274.467,7279.338,As we consider the Seattle rescue plan three in this year's fall budget.,134,,
607,0.97,7279.338,7282.575,Thanks again for your ongoing work to make sure that these dollars get out the door.,134,,
608,0.97,7282.575,7295.388,"Okay thank you very much, I want to thank--and we do have an FTE on the agenda for today.",135,,
609,0.97,7295.388,7331.791,"I'm having a feeling that we are probably going to need at the next hour plus for the next three bills so I want to ask folks to please read the materials from the Mft report that is provided, this is a helpful grounding report and summary presentation that--for action on the 17th because we need to take action on an FTE before September to make sure that we continue to move forward with the efforts to try to create additional housing and make sure that we are not delaying any of that process.",135,,
610,0.97,7331.791,7348.24,So if there is not any objection what I would like to do is ask folks to read those materials and prepare for more actions to come and legislation to be--anything else before we say goodbye to you?,135,,
611,0.97,7348.24,7352.044,Okay.,135,,
612,0.97,7352.044,7353.045,"We appreciate it, thank you.",135,,
613,0.97,7353.045,7357.55,"Let's move on, Mme.",135,,
614,0.97,7357.55,7362.621,Court to the next item in this is another item for possible bill in front of us before we get to the two other items.,135,,
615,0.97,7362.621,7362.822,Mme.,135,,
616,0.97,7362.822,7367.46,Clerk will you please read item number four make into the record.,135,,
617,0.97,7367.46,7398.357,"Item number four, counsel bill 120147 and ordinance relating to the financing of the general Fund, authorizing Interfund loans up to a total amount of $205 million from multiple city funds to the general fund as bridge financing to be repaid from future tax proceeds and other anticipated revenues and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",136,,
618,0.97,7398.357,7399.625,Thank you Mme.,137,,
619,0.97,7399.625,7407.299,"Clerk, I welcome to the table here--from the city budgets office, Dir.",137,,
620,0.97,7407.299,7450.743,"Glenn Lee from the city Finance administered of services Department, Aly Pennucci and Tom Mikesell from central staff, thank you for the presentation that is attached and the staff memo, colleagues very briefly we passed jump starts Seattle, payroll tax last year, we know this would be incurring taxes before we had the mechanisms to collect the taxes so again in 2020 we responded to the crisis that Covid presented, in 2021 we continue to make sure we were responding to the Covid crisis and that we were showing, shoring up core and critical city services.",137,,
621,0.97,7450.743,7467.026,With the hope that in 2022 when the remedies began flowing in from 2021 we would be able to Backfill those coffers and expectation that electing of taxes would help future investments.,137,,
622,0.97,7467.026,7477.77,"The 2022 spend plan going forward really makes those massive investments in affordable housing and acquisition, a green new deal and economic resilience.",137,,
623,0.97,7477.77,7489.982,"But the plan here has always been that we would not begin collecting 2021, this year's Jumpstart tax revenue until the beginning of 2022.",137,,
624,0.97,7489.982,7501.16,So in order for us to bridge the need for spending those dollars and when we pay it back we have an Interfund loan in front of us for consideration.,137,,
625,0.97,7501.16,7528.921,"The bill in front of us is a typical budget bill that APPROVES about $205 million from a loan from several city funds and per city policy the city's debt management policy advisory committee comprised of myself, central staff director, budget director Glenn noble, finance director Lee, the director of public utilities, and the director of city light also did two weeks ago to approve this loan.",137,,
626,0.97,7528.921,7540.533,"We don't necessarily anticipate needing this full-blown all the way through 2022, we can pay back the loan in advance at any time and there's no penalty.",137,,
627,0.97,7540.533,7554.546,In fact our expectation and assumption is that we may be able to pay this back by end of year 2022 but to ensure that we are giving ourselves ample time--we have authorized it through this legislation to the end of the year.,137,,
628,0.97,7554.546,7572.231,As a reminder this is the first year that Jumpstart revenues will be paid quarterly and we have a desire to make sure that there is some flex ability as we work on receiving these new funds in 2022 again for the 2021 payroll tax year.,137,,
629,0.97,7572.231,7600.659,I will turn it over to central staff and to our directors noble and Lee for more detail but this is another really great piece of follow-up legislation from the Jumpstart progressive payroll tax to make sure that we are Actualizing the receipt of these revenues and that we can make sure that we are Aligning those to keep our budget absolutely in the black and invest in critical services.,137,,
630,0.97,7600.659,7610.402,"And I just want to double check, Tom did you have any orientation comments to make from central staff to begin with?",137,,
631,0.97,7610.402,7611.47,Good morning Mdm.,138,,
632,0.97,7611.47,7616.308,"Chair, no I believe you summarized it quite clearly.",138,,
633,0.97,7616.308,7617.509,So I would have nothing to add.,138,,
634,0.97,7617.509,7622.414,I love it.,139,,
635,0.97,7622.414,7624.45,I've been living this bill and I appreciate that information.,139,,
636,0.97,7624.45,7627.686,I will turn it over to director been noble and thank you for joining us.,139,,
637,0.97,7627.686,7638.43,"Thank you chairman, and our speaking points though we have not collaborated, you've covered much of what I wanted to say.",140,,
638,0.97,7638.43,7645.137,"Just a quick couple of points, to just reaffirm what you had said.",140,,
639,0.97,7645.137,7667.659,"As the Mayor proposed and Council approved, the 2021 budget relies on approximately $200 million in revenues from the payroll tax and because we are in the first year and according to the rule maker, the payroll tax was set up so that the first payments were not made until the first quarter of next year.",140,,
640,0.97,7667.659,7671.363,So we built the budget around those revenues for this year and the first payment comes next year.,140,,
641,0.97,7671.363,7672.364,Hence a cash flow problem.,140,,
642,0.97,7672.364,7676.635,But one as you can see that we have a specific proposal to manage.,140,,
643,0.97,7676.635,7701.794,It's a proposal that calls for a loan up to 200 million through 2022 and as you described we don't think we will need alone authority beyond that because in the second year the payroll tax so starting next year payments will be due quarterly and with that kind of payment schedule given the way the city generally Expends money we can manage without another loan.,140,,
644,0.97,7701.794,7724.783,"We frequently do Interfund loans for short periods and in anticipation of some particular payment of cash, in the past it may have been a sale of property or some revenue stream, to scale and we've done those not frequently but not unusually if you will.",140,,
645,0.97,7724.783,7742.234,"What is different if anything about this one is the scale, $200 million is a large some of money obviously and typically when we've done Interfund loans we would identify a single fund that would have the resources to provide the near-term cash from one fund to another very specifically.",140,,
646,0.97,7742.234,7757.649,"In this case given the scale of the loan we think it makes more sense to give the executive in particular Glenn Lee who will speak in a moment, flexibility to identify the lending funds based upon their individual cash Posiion at any given time.",140,,
647,0.97,7757.649,7803.529,"If you could advance to the next slide, you can see the list of funds that we've identified as potential donor or lending funds, the thing to know about these funds, a group of them are associated with capital to--and the transportation benefit district and also move Seattle, but those are all funds that are typically invested in resources and capital projects, the delay associated in making allocations and spending money in the capital budget just in the natural course of design, development and bidding, it's not unusual for these funds to carry balances because of that delay.",140,,
648,0.97,7803.529,7805.03,So they are a natural place to look.,140,,
649,0.97,7805.03,7826.118,"Some of T█He other levy funds, that we've built, the spending plan for levees such that in the initial year we spend less knowing the programs will expand and to shore up resources to spend high in later years and that is the reason some operational levees have some Resourcs.",140,,
650,0.97,7826.118,7829.421,And a couple of the funds have built up balances overtime for a variety of reasons.,140,,
651,0.97,7829.421,7861.253,"The bottom line is, giving Fi s and Glenn Lee his role as Finance director, the flex ability to identify lending funds and the best approach to getting the resources that we need, and without avoiding any impact,--director Lee to provide the lending funds in a way that does not constrain or restrict the underlying purposes of which the original funds were allocated.",140,,
652,0.97,7861.253,7867.359,So this is not interrupting any of the policy intended work that these funds support.,140,,
653,0.97,7867.359,7881.139,"So that is basically, you've provided the big picture view and this is a little more detail on what resources would come from where and I don't know if Glenn has anything to add.",140,,
654,0.97,7881.139,7898.09,"We will monitor this literally daily to ensure that we can cover our general fund responsibilities, the borrowing Fund and not disrupt in any way the operations that are funded by any of these source funds.",141,,
655,0.97,7898.09,7907.599,In addition the source funds will receive interest payments that would be equal to what we are earning in our portfolio.,141,,
656,0.97,7907.599,7939.231,"So in other words it would be indifferent to the managers of these funds whether or not we borrow their resources for general fund expenses for a short term need or we invest in our normal processes through the state, the law gives us the ability to invest our cash proceeds on a short-term basis and we do that in line with the law so again the owners of these funds will not notice a difference in either their income or operations.",141,,
657,0.97,7939.231,7943.335,Very good.,142,,
658,0.97,7943.335,7962.354,"It does mean that there will be interest payments due from the general fund as it borrows these resources and we will be budgeting those, and we don't expect to carry the full 200 million balance for an extended Timeframe.",142,,
659,0.97,7962.354,7969.061,So a low-cost way to manage this situation.,142,,
660,0.97,7969.061,7972.965,Yes.,143,,
661,0.97,7972.965,7974.166,Any questions?,144,,
662,0.97,7974.166,7976.635,Excellent.,145,,
663,0.97,7976.635,8003.862,"I will ask one question is other persons may have questions, regarding payback, there was a hope and again I will reiterate a hope and expectation potentially that we will pay it back before the end of the year and I just want to confirm that there is no penalty or anything like that if we pay it back and if we see the ability for us to pay it back we will be acting on that as soon as we can.",145,,
664,0.97,8003.862,8006.098,Yes and we do that with Interfund loans in general.,146,,
665,0.97,8006.098,8024.015,There is no prepayment penalty whatsoever and if we see that the borrowing fund actually could have a sustainable positive balance we will just in the loan program as we see fit and it's in the interest of everyone that we close these loans off as quickly as possible.,146,,
666,0.97,8024.015,8036.128,So if we determine that the borrowing fund against the general fund can sustain itself under current city code we will terminate the loan.,146,,
667,0.97,8036.128,8050.008,But right now we are not sure exactly when that happens so it's really prudent to get us to the end of the year 2022.,146,,
668,0.97,8050.008,8085.143,"The analogies to personal finances don't work exactly by any means but one way to think about these loans is that they are like a home equity line of credit so we can borrow up to $200 million if we have that immediate need but we are not on the hook for a $200 million loan the day this is authorized, we will pool resources as needed, cash flow can change, almost on a daily basis and we will keep to the minimum and again there is no obligation to take the full amount.",147,,
669,0.97,8085.143,8089.781,We will keep payment so as well.,147,,
670,0.97,8089.781,8093.285,Especially as you see rolling payments come in on a quarterly basis.,148,,
671,0.97,8093.285,8093.652,Exactly.,149,,
672,0.97,8093.652,8095.087,Councilmember Lisa Herbold go ahead.,150,,
673,0.97,8095.087,8096.087,Thanks.,151,,
674,0.97,8096.087,8110.101,Confronting my understanding that the revenue intended to pay back this loan is the planned receipts from payroll tax.,151,,
675,0.97,8110.101,8113.572,Yes.,152,,
676,0.97,8113.572,8124.716,"And has there been any, I know we kind of check in periodically around want our projections are for the payroll tax.",153,,
677,0.97,8124.716,8142.234,"The receipts in 2022, have we looked at that issue recently to see whether or not our past productions are Aligning with our current productions? that's my first question.",153,,
678,0.97,8142.234,8172.264,"The second question is a little bit of a tangent but because we are talking about Interfund loans I remember director noble a couple of years ago when we were, the Council was seeking to increase the number of dollars that housing could get out with, I believe it's 2019--, we authorized a plan, a $21 million housing bond and I remember you director noble saying the housing bond was great but we don't need it, we can do in Interfund loan.",153,,
679,0.97,8172.264,8189.748,"To pay that off, and I'm wondering, is that $29 million housing bond still out there waiting to be paid off or have we used the Interfund loan to pay it off?",153,,
680,0.97,8189.748,8199.691,"I need to research the answer to this question, it's just a little blurry in my head.",154,,
681,0.97,8199.691,8203.962,"That's not a problem, I was just taking advantage of the fact you were here to ask it.",155,,
682,0.97,8203.962,8219.778,"I was complaining in my head, I know this is associated with a change in state law around, I think it was a portion of either--but I apologize, I don't have a specific number on this bond issue.",156,,
683,0.97,8219.778,8231.59,"I'm sorry, I'm with Ben, there were several related adjustments that occurred and at this moment I can't remember exactly what the bond issuance was.",157,,
684,0.97,8231.59,8238.897,"We are more than happy to assemble the story, I just don't recall off the top of my head.",157,,
685,0.97,8238.897,8239.497,Thank you.,158,,
686,0.97,8239.497,8262.254,"With regard to the first question we did review as part of the April forecast update, we did review the forecast for payroll tax revenues and--is working on the update for August, the August revenue update we will have those shortly and this will be a focus there as well.",159,,
687,0.97,8262.254,8297.789,"A little bit of a Teaser looking ahead but not anticipating significant change, at least at this stage, that work is not complete yet and I would highlight that in the context of alone that is the abstract risk here is that revenues will not come in at the level way and thought, that they will come in on it once rather than quarterly so we will have to respond Accordingly if that is what happens, it will be early in the budget year 2022 that we will have the opportunity to take a step back and look at the path forward and I wouldn't want to anticipate what that might be.",159,,
688,0.97,8297.789,8310.802,So obviously it's an important question and as of April the forecast is--to tell you that this loan still makes sense and is in our best interest.,159,,
689,0.97,8310.802,8314.806,Thank you.,160,,
690,0.97,8314.806,8315.307,Great.,161,,
691,0.97,8315.307,8316.574,I'm not seeing any additional questions.,161,,
692,0.97,8316.574,8318.877,Let me double check.,161,,
693,0.97,8318.877,8320.111,Okay.,161,,
694,0.97,8320.111,8330.922,So director Lee I want to thank you specifically for your ongoing work as well related to implementation.,161,,
695,0.97,8330.922,8374.566,I really appreciate the Rulemaking that you've been engaged with with some of the larger employers who will be paying this assessment and I think from those conversations we had good discussion about how to make sure that we were creating ease for paying the owed taxes and I'm happy to have made that update as well to the legislation earlier this year as well as creating the Seattle Jumpstart Fund . It is really going to allow for us to help answer the question that Councilmember Lisa Herbold asked which is how are expected revenues Aligning with received revenues and making sure those dollars are getting out to those Prioritized areas and the spend plan will be more transparent as well.,161,,
696,0.97,8374.566,8384.876,Colleagues I am going to go ahead and move the committee recommend passage of counsel bill 120 120147 is there a second?,161,,
697,0.97,8384.876,8388.78,Second.,162,,
698,0.97,8388.78,8393.885,"Thank you, it has been moved and second, are there any additional comment on the legislation in front of us about the Interfund loan?",163,,
699,0.97,8393.885,8394.486,Hearing none Mdm.,163,,
700,0.97,8394.486,8400.892,Clerk will you please call the role on the passage of counsel bill 120147?,163,,
701,0.97,8400.892,8410.502,[roll call] Mdm.,164,,
702,0.97,8410.502,8415.607,Chair that is four favored none opposed.,164,,
703,0.97,8415.607,8425.717,"It's unanimous, the motion carries in the committee recommendation that the bill passed will be sent to the August 9 Seattle city council meeting for final vote.",165,,
704,0.97,8425.717,8433.825,"Thank you very much director noble, thank you director Lee and thank you as always Tom Mikesell and central staff for your research on this legislation.",165,,
705,0.97,8433.825,8434.826,Thank you.,166,,
706,0.97,8434.826,8437.529,Okay Mdm.,167,,
707,0.97,8437.529,8447.705,Clerk I think at this time we are ready to move into items number five and six.,167,,
708,0.97,8447.705,8462.72,Colleagues I would like to have these items read into the record together but as a reminder there is no scheduled vote for today's items so we will start with an orientation of the legislation in front of us and then have a chance to ask some additional questions and Walk-Through any breaking news or questions that we may have.,167,,
709,0.97,8462.72,8465.19,Adam clerk would you read item number five and six?,167,,
710,0.97,8465.19,8476.768,"Item number five counsel bill 120111 an ordinance, and I have counsel bill number six number 612 number 612-0112.",168,,
711,0.97,8476.768,8490.481,"An ordinance Authoring in 2021 acceptance of funding from Non- city sources, authorizing the heads of the executive Department --",168,,
712,0.97,8490.481,8491.783,Wonderful.,169,,
713,0.97,8491.783,8511.302,"So we have our team from central staff with us, Aly Pennucci and Tom Mikesell and we are also joined by Greg Doss this morning and colleagues I want to remind us that we are reviewing both the acceptance and supplemental ordinance that we began discussing it last week's meeting.",169,,
714,0.97,8511.302,8534.225,"We have a desire to make sure that we are using today's meeting to identify possible amendments, talk about any questions or issues that you identify with either the grand acceptance or the supplemental ordinance and make sure that we have this time for us over the next about an hour, 45 minutes to an hour to discuss items that may be coming up for possible vote on the 17th.",169,,
715,0.97,8534.225,8558.65,"If there are not amendments that you've already been concentrating or if today's conversations, you want to have an additional minute that has not been submitted again the deadline was last Tuesday so given some of the information that has been shared since last Tuesday we want to make sure that we have a chance to ask questions and fully understand the supplemental budget process and information in front of us today.",169,,
716,0.97,8558.65,8575.667,"If there is additional amendments that you're contemplating please do reach out to central staff and give them notification by tomorrow, Wednesday, August 4 by noon so that we can begin working as quickly as possible on any amendments.",169,,
717,0.97,8575.667,8586.844,My intention is to try to share those early with Councilmembers so they can have conversations about those possible amendments at the August 17 the meeting for discussion and vote.,169,,
718,0.97,8586.844,8598.79,"A reminder that the supplemental budget should not reflect, excuse me, should reflect changing circumstances and policies that are developed throughout the year and this is not a chance to redo this year's budget.",169,,
719,0.97,8598.79,8613.271,We will have a chance to make major policy changes and investments in our calendar year budget as we consider the 2022 budget which will begin in just a few months.,169,,
720,0.97,8613.271,8622.814,In fact the Mayor's office is expected to send down their proposed budget next month and that will initiate our budget process starting at the end of September and going into October.,169,,
721,0.97,8622.814,8665.256,"We did have a preview of the proposed grant acceptance and supplement a budget two weeks ago in committee and since transmitting that supplemental the Mayor's office publicly announced last Thursday after amendments were to, plans that they are interested in investing in and obviously that is not a direct relation to the supplemental budget and the announcement that was made but because it is a budget document that they are Referencing it did seem like it was an important opportunity for us to have central staff walk us through both the supplemental and the grant acceptance ordinance and also Flogging potential questions that colleagues may have while regarding any of the information we received over the last--.",169,,
722,0.97,8665.256,8672.563,With that I will turn it over to Aly Pennucci to walk us through the bills in front of us.,169,,
723,0.97,8672.563,8706.497,"Thank you, and I will turn it over to Tom to do a high- level summary of the two bills that you Walk-Through in more detail on that are described in more detail, and as you mentioned our colleague Greg Doss is on the line to discuss the SPD budget memo that the Council received last week and other central staff colleagues and other questions that come up related to--or other posed--so I will turn it over to Tom.",170,,
724,0.97,8706.497,8707.799,Thank you.,171,,
725,0.97,8707.799,8719.31,So just in recognition of time and that we started the conversation at the last committee meeting I'm going to give a really high- level overview of the two items.,171,,
726,0.97,8719.31,8746.637,"Item 5 is counsel bill one item 5 is counsel bill 120111 and it's the first comprehensive grant acceptance legislation so the Council is instilled with the authority to accept grants from external funding sources that we received during the year, this particular bill would accept a total of 23 point trillion dollars from funding sources that are detailed in the detail attached to the agenda.",171,,
727,0.97,8746.637,8756.047,"Item 6, that is the second conference of supplemental budget legislation that has been transmitted by the executive in 2021.",171,,
728,0.97,8756.047,8779.37,"The bill proposes midyear appropriations, position and capital project changes that are assumed to be Unforeseeable when the budget, the original 2020 budget, 2021 a budget was adopted must file, fall,--increase the revised budget by $15 million and would add 68 positions.",171,,
729,0.97,8779.37,8786.077,As promised that is a very high level review of those to build.,171,,
730,0.97,8786.077,8789.781,Those two bills.,171,,
731,0.97,8789.781,8791.582,I guess I will jump in next Mdm.,172,,
732,0.97,8791.582,8798.589,"Chair, a pleasure, good morning members of the committee and good morning for two minutes still.",172,,
733,0.97,8798.589,8817.475,"Do you mind holding just one second, Councilmember Lisa Herbold, I saw you wanted to flag for the opportunity to jump in and also just pause really quick to see if there were any other questions on the supplemental or the grant acceptance.",173,,
734,0.97,8817.475,8834.392,I may not be following the outline that you proposed for addressing these issues but I am assuming that this is an okay pause to ask a question about the grant acceptance ordinance?,174,,
735,0.97,8834.392,8836.294,Is that okay?,174,,
736,0.97,8836.294,8837.895,Absolutely please go ahead.,175,,
737,0.97,8837.895,8870.361,"So you notice that there is, there seems to be at least, does there seem to be any grant acceptance funding for the Seattle police Department included in this ordinance, I understand that might be because of misunderstanding on the part of the budget office on what the Council was hoping for.",176,,
738,0.97,8870.361,8877.468,As it relates to SPD budget approvals moving forward.,176,,
739,0.97,8877.468,8890.214,And I don't want to get us in a position where we are getting SPD grant acceptance much later in the year,176,,
740,0.97,9578.001,9604.361,One piece of legislation that would authorize the spending of salary savings for hiring bonuses and also remove Council Provisos so that the Department could start spending internal resources on separation pay and deferred compensation but that's a rather limited piece of legislation.,177,,
741,0.97,9604.361,9616.006,"It's the case that to do many of the things that the Mayor would like to do and that are articulated in that letter, the Mayor would need to propose additional legislation.",177,,
742,0.97,9616.006,9625.882,There would need to be legislation that would create new civilian positions such as a new squad of Csos that are proposed in that letter.,177,,
743,0.97,9625.882,9639.096,There would need to be legislation that would make appropriations to other departments and an appropriation to the Seattle fire Department for triage 1.,177,,
744,0.97,9639.096,9653.443,How that would make use of SPD salary savings would need to be determined whether there would be a cut to SPD and then an appropriation to Seattle fire or some other means of getting the money out of SPD and into Seattle fire.,177,,
745,0.97,9653.443,9674.598,That's something that the Mayor's office would need to determine and send the bill to Council and that's not been occurred and there's no plan articulated for that yet and finally there's this need to address the grants acceptance and authorization.,177,,
746,0.97,9674.598,9677.567,That's something that needs to happen.,177,,
747,0.97,9677.567,9701.892,"Allie and I have been told by Cvo staff that there is a plan to send a bill sometime in late August that would at least address the grants, the acceptance of SPD grants and appropriation of grants.",177,,
748,0.97,9701.892,9755.512,"That bill could serve as an vehicle that the Mayor put forward such as appropriating the community of public investments or investments 1 or civilian positions to SPD or truly some of SPD's budget so serve on the program and that could serve as a vehicle and you can use the supplemental budget as now to make some of these changes that the Mayor has suggested and that is really a decision that is for the Council right now, do we want to use the supplemental budget outside that now you want to make suggested changes or do you want to wait till the Mayor sends legislation O in two or three weeks and do it in sort of a comprehensive SPD bill.",177,,
749,0.97,9755.512,9783.106,So with that is sort of an overview and I am happy to go into a deep dive into what the Mayor has proposed and sort of a line by line dive of the letter with all the proposed changes with SPD or I'm happy to do that later in the public safety M meeting as planned next Tuesday.,177,,
750,0.97,9783.106,9784.074,Thanks.,178,,
751,0.97,9784.074,9820.243,I just want to signal my interest in funding elements that do not require additional legislation so I've expressed my interest in a down payment on the $2 million for cities participation in the regional peace keeper collaboration.,178,,
752,0.97,9820.243,9839.029,I've signaled my interest in funding the purchase of the funding needed by the community safety and communications center dispatch system.,178,,
753,0.97,9839.029,9886.276,"This investment needs to be made as soon as possible in order to even begin to look at how more calls can be diverted to Non-Spd, Non-Fire Department responses and that will lay the foundation for the future investment in the triage 1 program, which I understand may need some other legislative authority.",178,,
754,0.97,9894.517,9907.864,Some of the technology investments that the executive is seeking so I'Mmenting to Ex- Tressa Arkansas press that I am interested in using this vehicle for some of those things.,178,,
755,0.97,9907.864,9924.08,I don't think we can wait for funding some of these items and it's really important to me that we address some of them in the fundamental budget.,178,,
756,0.97,9924.08,9934.291,Thank you.,178,,
757,0.97,10010.367,10029.586,"Thank you, we're making permanent Street cafes and informing decisions city wide for implementation policy and an amendment I had before you today but I know we won't be voting on today and L it's a--there are two boat houses in our city.",179,,
758,0.97,10029.586,10034.724,One at the pits in South Seattle and one in green Lake.,179,,
759,0.97,10034.724,10045.935,These two boat houses serve the entirety of the city and green Lake people and Pioneer square all the way to shoreline.,179,,
760,0.97,10045.935,10061.985,What we have is a redevelopment of this building to accommodate the uses that are needed.,179,,
761,0.97,10075.532,10082.472,This new building will Acome community space and will be a community center enthusiast for the shoreline.,179,,
762,0.97,10082.472,10132.222,"They've been under a fundraising program for many years at this point and they're now $1.25 million away from finalizing their budget and their permit ready, shovel ready, I'm just excited to bring this amendment forward and I will flag that we ask parks Department and other levels of government and making sure it's shovel ready and I'm excited to have both boat houses in Seattle fully completed.",179,,
763,0.97,10132.222,10132.655,"Thank you, chair.",179,,
764,0.97,10132.655,10134.457,That's the report on my amendment.,179,,
765,0.97,10134.457,10136.092,Thank you so much.,180,,
766,0.97,10136.092,10151.04,Any Council members have any questions?,180,,
767,0.97,10151.04,10164.053,"Council member Strauss, we took a role call and will send out over committee and want to make sure while I had you on the line, if you're interested in adding your name to that from Committee, we'd be happy to have you.",180,,
768,0.97,10164.053,10166.756,Thank you for that additional opportunity.,181,,
769,0.97,10166.756,10178.601,Happy and honor of a privilege to sign off.,181,,

771,0.97,10181.171,10196.786,Several members Referenced for funding for SPD or the Seattle fire Department or the community safety and communications center.,183,,
772,0.97,10196.786,10220.276,I also have proposals for amendments that would fund public disclosure requests being handled by the office of police accountability and Seattle it to deal with very large backlog of Pdr complaints or Pdr requests to SPD.,183,,
773,0.97,10220.276,10280.97,I also have funding proposal that would fund FAS for space for evidence storage as identified as an urgent need as office of Inspector General because the city is running out of space to store evidence and then Lastly I want to just signal interest in Piloting a community Responder program that would address some of the needs identified in the Nick Junior report.,183,,
774,0.97,10280.97,10289.746,The report identified that the percentage of calls that could be handled by Nonpolice response and a lot of back and forth of what the right number is.,183,,
775,0.97,10289.746,10331.521,"The police Department and the executive actually agree that 12% of the calls 911 takes can be handled by a Nonpolice officers response but the triage program proposes to handle a small portion of that percent and it would be really exciting to explore funding a community response, a crisis response, community based crisis response program.",183,,
776,0.97,10331.521,10343.299,"I know the executives reported to my committee there were no applications to Hsds, capacity building, public safety, Rfp.",183,,
777,0.97,10343.299,10382.238,"I understand that there was actually and Hsd was not considering this because it was a geographically focused pilot rather than a city wide proposal, but there is a proposed pilot for the Lake City area for a 24 hour a day, seven day a week community response.",183,,
778,0.97,10391.948,10392.682,Excellent.,184,,
779,0.97,10392.682,10394.016,"Thank you, council member.",184,,
780,0.97,10394.016,10440.73,I'm asking for a pause because I think it was important to see what was on the docket for potential amendments prior to some of the information that was out there that may influence supplemental and appreciate the opportunity to hear where Council members making possible changes and then we'll go into the summary where it's articulated and people can ask questions about what the executive is potentially proposing and Council member Lewis I see you and thank you for working with us and central staff and the amendment.,184,,
781,0.97,10440.73,10472.562,I spoke last week and I will be bring an amendment to Re- Prioritize the Underspend associated with the delay and standing up the tiny House villages as we know from the select Committee on homeless meeting last week and there's considerable understand spend that the Council fully funded three tiny House villages to begin operation as early as January of 2021.,185,,
782,0.97,10472.562,10490.646,It's anticipated those villages will open for the most part in October of this year so there's considerable Underspend from the operations that we didn't have to pay for and they haven't been built.,185,,
783,0.97,10490.646,10523.779,The Re-Purposes of those funds are to reassess those organizations are experiencing unanticipated overruns with completion of permanent supportive housing projects and chief Seattle Club indicated support and they're currently trying to complete with the square neighborhood where this money could be put to use as a one time resource.,185,,
784,0.97,10523.779,10531.854,The goal would be to make sure it's a one time priority and we'll have the villages up and running and we want to be able to fully fund them for 2022.,185,,
785,0.97,10557.78,10557.914,.,185,,
786,0.97,10557.914,10562.018,Thank you very much Council member Lewis.,186,,
787,0.97,10562.018,10569.392,Appreciate that and I will fund two amendments and then let's move on if there's no other amendments that people want to flag.,186,,
788,0.97,10569.392,10602.458,"Two I was considering, one would dove tail what Council member Lewis just spoke about, which was trying to allocate around $200,000 to an entity like South solution Northwest that helps build the tiny House we need and rely on volunteer labor and volunteer donation which is greatly needed and those doing work on behalf of the city get paid for it and we're interested in allocating some portion of an Underspend as well to building those tiny houses and some solutions Northwest.",186,,
789,0.97,10602.458,10632.488,Other item that I'm very interested in is continuing to expand upon the grants that have gone out the door and either extending the time line from 18 months to 24 months or seeing if there was additional investments that were not funded through Hsd's community safety response systems that would need additional support and looking to provide assistance in the round of $1- $2 million there.,186,,
790,0.97,10632.488,10700.923,"Those are some of the ideas and supporting the call and having support and overreach to do the outreach and the bigger questions we've been looking into over the last two weeks is the capacity for both reach and entities like them and I'm looking forward to a broad budget proposal that would allow for us to have more organizations funded and trained in the just cares like model so there's a place for those outreach contacts to go to so, again, as we think about alternatives to just Incarceration or policing and wanting to make sure it's going to the investment in the upstream solution is something I'm continuing to look into.",186,,
791,0.97,10712.935,10717.573,That would allow the Predevelopment dollars to go into the Garfield project.,186,,
792,0.97,10717.573,10720.443,"With that, just want to turn it over to Greg.",186,,
793,0.97,10720.443,10722.678,"Not seeing additional hands at this point, Greg.",186,,
794,0.97,10722.678,10735.758,Let's hear how some of those items either overlap with what the major has proposed or maybe are new items that are being put in front of the Council at this point.,186,,
795,0.97,10735.758,10748.37,"As you said, if we were to see how that proposal is either in alignment or not with what we're considering for this supplemental budget in front of us.",186,,
796,0.97,10843.365,10843.499,.,186,,
797,0.97,10843.499,10897.353,"Positions that worked with the community and sworn salary savings became available, the department had interest in using the salary savings to fill some of these civilian positions and Council member Herbold in the crafting of her amendments for Council bill 119981 would have funded the salary savings these positions specifically with prevention coordinator and the Department promoted data work and as it is the Department in this particular list had Idolled some more civilians into the next.",187,,
798,0.97,10897.353,10911.467,They have now added into this mix another unit of Csos that they would propose to fill and use sworn salary savings to fund.,187,,
799,0.97,10911.467,10940.095,As I said in my opening comments and they don't have position authority for an additional unit of Csos and this is another thing hanging out there and a vehicle you have before you and you could do it in the legislation that they're planning on sending in September.,187,,
800,0.97,10940.095,10961.016,So they've also got the public safety liaison and they've added a training coordinator position and that's a new one since the beginning of the year and some additional staff assistance for public disclosure work.,187,,
801,0.97,10961.016,10977.066,So all of those positions are covered in the first two lines and those are the civilian positions that are with the sworn Savings and the next line is technology investments.,187,,
802,0.97,10977.066,10977.967,Thank you.,188,,
803,0.97,10977.967,10979.668,Just really quickly.,189,,
804,0.97,10979.668,11047.036,"Given this bill is before us now, if the rest of the committee agrees, I think it would make sense to take the action that would not require a title change and a reintroduction so again, funding those vacant unfunded existing positions and taking that action within the bill and considering an action to add positions in future legislation is reserving time to consider the request that require additional authority at a later date.",189,,
805,0.97,11047.036,11047.369,Thank you.,190,,
806,0.97,11047.369,11067.389,"I understand the sheet in front of us on the screen is a reorientation of the spread sheet in your memo on pages 7 and 8. is there a a way that we can cross reference that with what Council member Herbolt just noted, which are the items that would not require a reintroduction that would be helpful.",190,,
807,0.97,11067.389,11067.923,Doesn't have to happen now.,190,,

811,0.97,11144.566,11155.277,That's not something that I feel like I can support in this package.,191,,

814,0.97,11222.911,11223.378,Two things.,193,,
815,0.97,11223.378,11234.222,"First, I hope I'm speaking correctly and it's possible as I read this memo and talks about new positions that are not included in the memo marked with an Asterisk.",193,,
816,0.97,11234.222,11252.107,"When they say new positions, I don't know if they mean they don't have authority for them or if that means that it's a position that they have authority for that they just didn't include in the January memos so staff needs to do a little more--I need to do a little more digging and I don't know if that's necessarily the cut Council member that you want to make.",193,,
817,0.97,11252.107,11275.163,"You may just want to make the cut of what was in the January memo and what was not in the January memo and then second, Allie has some things that she wants to add.",193,,

819,0.97,11308.096,11381.97,"One of the questions before the committee in terms of reviewing action in the supplemental, maybe our supplemental budget Ordnance is whether or not you agree with their proposed approach for Re-Purposing some of the salary Savings and if you do not--actions to take to restrict spending in certain ways and some actions they can do already within their existing appropriations as Greg mentioned may have positions that are vacant and could be filled as well as the budget office has some authority to establish emergency positions if needed and the Council may need to take a Proactive step in affirmatively saying they cannot use funds if you disagree with any of these spending areas and considering what your priority are and in part we're here today and it's difficult to make these decisions individually as one use of salary savings with use of those funds.",194,,
820,0.97,11381.97,11382.537,Back to you.,194,,

841,0.97,11711.433,11775.663,So the technology investments item is they have a white board and cards and someone in payroll goes through them and documents them so that would automate that system.,203,,
842,0.97,11775.663,11830.285,The National Institute for criminal justice reform contract you may be familiar that in the last and entered into mental health for officers and this is part of a hiring retention and wellness program that the Department would put into place.,203,,

850,0.97,11968.523,12050.338,One of my Projectives and authority legislation is to end the practice of and there's some authorization for the Council for Ftd to use those funds or else we are going to continue the cycle of SPD paying for what they want to pay for and coming to us after the fact and asking permission for what they've already done and one of my high priorities for this bill is to figure out what things the Council supports.,204,,
851,0.97,12052.673,12055.042,Thank you very much.,205,,
852,0.97,12055.042,12090.812,Some of these items and the next few are easy and separation pay and just simply the PAYOUT and sick time when an office leaves and costs not covered in the budget and additional officers leaving and the same is true of the next item deferred compensation and there is a requirement in the SpA contract with city matches and deferred compensation and that needs to be paid out.,206,,
853,0.97,12090.812,12100.588,The third item was a bit more--the next item is a bit more complicated event over time.,206,,
854,0.97,12100.588,12113.901,When the 2021 adopted budget was written by the Council when the proposed budget was submitted by the Mayor and it was written by the Council and both the Mayor and the Council made cuts to event over time.,206,,
855,0.97,12113.901,12128.616,And the cuts were made with the assumption that the Covid situation would continue potentially longer than it has.,206,,
856,0.97,12128.616,12139.494,I think the vaccine becoming widely available in the spring happened sooner than I think almost anyone thought it would.,206,,
857,0.97,12139.494,12167.855,That leaves the situation like it will staff other events like I thought it would and I think it's going to be subsequent for a short fall in overtime funding leading for the events and they're Currentliest mating that short fall would be about $3 million.,206,,
858,0.97,12167.855,12170.892,Does Council member Herboldf have a question?,206,,

860,0.97,12172.593,12208.629,This paid leave is only one component of a larger item and total amount of paid parental lead and it's $1.8 million and there is $1.6 million that is sitting in finance general in reserve for SPD that will be transferred at the end of the year to SPD but it's not enough.,208,,
861,0.97,12252.573,12266.687,It's my understanding it would also lift Council proviso to allow for much of the spending in the items I've covered above.,208,,
862,0.97,12266.687,12285.84,So going--finishing out the list and that's $13.7 million and these are all items that SPD would fund mostly related to SPD.,208,,
863,0.97,12285.84,12296.317,"Then there are these items that I'm about to go into now, which are some new public safety initiatives.",208,,

873,0.97,12447.735,12450.337,I'm trying to look at my multiple screens for a possible hand.,211,,
874,0.97,12450.337,12454.208,I guess I have a question about this incentive pay.,211,,
875,0.97,12454.208,12487.341,We've heard repeatedly especially in Council member Lewis' committee meeting regarding homeless services that there is a funding shortage and has been appropriated by this funding signed into law by the Mayor in homeless services and concerned about the resistance to standing up the tiny House villages and others created.,211,,
876,0.97,12487.341,12526.247,One of the Rationals we heard was a shortage of personnel within HSI and we know that Covid has dramatically affected the folks that have already are within human services contracted organizations so I guess.,211,,
877,0.97,12539.426,12549.87,I'm talking incentive pay.,212,,
878,0.97,12576.997,12579.733,Any additional questions that folks have?,213,,
879,0.97,12579.733,12579.934,Okay.,213,,
880,0.97,12579.934,12587.641,Any questions or comments on the entire package here?,213,,
881,0.97,12587.641,12587.841,Okay.,213,,
882,0.97,12587.841,12590.844,I want to thank you Council members for your involvement in this discussion today.,213,,
883,0.97,12590.844,12603.991,"Obviously there's a lot of questions that are still to be answered, and I appreciate Council member Herboldf having a similar conversation trying to get into the policy details here in front of us next Tuesday.",213,,
884,0.97,12603.991,12604.858,Is that right?,213,,
885,0.97,12604.858,12605.125,Yeah.,214,,
886,0.97,12605.125,12605.593,Okay.,215,,
887,0.97,12605.593,12685.773,So I will be tuning in if not asking for request to join the meeting as well and more with supplemental budget and full understanding and being proposed for us and touch base on triage one and interest in a triage system and this is part of the reason why the Council tripled the amount of investments going into the health one dance so we had alternatives to of at least showing up for well checks and for example recently here in the North areas saw both fire and police responding to a individual twice in one morning who was needing a well check and I can absolutely understand the need folks with first responders coming out to do a well check hopefully having them as case managers and social services providers being able to do that initial assessment and how that would both be a cost savings and how it would be reducing the interaction with individuals Showingup with officers when we need caseworkers and social workers showing up to do the assessment.,215,,
888,0.97,12685.773,12709.129,I still have a question about where the Handoff goes to and I'm Councilly interested in expanding those community safety and grants that Hsd has authorized and that's Expending those and adding additional capacity and have to have somewhere to refer folks off to and flagging my own interest in that.,215,,
