198,0.97,933.932,935.834,Thank you for having me here today.,21,,
199,0.97,935.834,938.404,A little on my background.,21,,
200,0.97,938.404,940.339,My name is Cara Kadoshima Vallier.,21,,
201,0.97,940.339,944.61,And I am the parent of two fourth generation Seattlites.,21,,
202,0.97,944.61,951.483,"I attended the University of Washington, then UCLA for my Masters in public policy.",21,,
203,0.97,951.483,957.022,"Cumulatively now, I've reached seven years at the city, both in the city attorney's office and in the legislative Department.",21,,
204,0.97,957.022,958.057,As you mentioned.,21,,
205,0.97,958.057,961.026,And now at the Mayor's office since March.,21,,
206,0.97,961.026,991.056,"I've worked in and serve on boards of organizations dealing with housing and land use permitting, zoning, regulation and compliance, in government, private and nonprofit sectors, including handling hearts before the California Coastal, assisting in preservation and nonprofit housing office at the little Tokyo service center and supporting equity and access at the Los Angeles League of voters.",21,,
207,0.97,991.056,995.227,My position now since joining Mayor Harrell's team.,21,,
208,0.97,995.227,999.164,I've managed policy development on issues related to housing and homelessness.,21,,
209,0.97,999.164,1005.037,And it's in that role that I'm representing his administration.,21,,
210,0.97,1005.037,1007.806,In this position.,21,,
211,0.97,1007.94,1010.943,Previous levy oversight rules have done.,21,,
212,0.97,1010.943,1020.652,"I'm really excited about being, having this opportunity to be on the housing levy to do that work.",21,,
213,0.97,1020.652,1025.424,That bolsters the fate in local government.,21,,
214,0.97,1025.424,1037.036,"Past levy results have demonstrated Weis use Leveraging, resources and acquiring property and maximizing our opportunities to provide affordable housing and secure homeownership.",21,,
215,0.97,1037.036,1040.272,So thank you for your consideration and for having me here today.,21,,
216,0.97,1040.272,1044.476,Wonderful.,22,,
217,0.97,1044.476,1059.425,& GT; Councilmember Pedersen please go ahead.,23,,
218,0.97,1059.425,1063.529,I fully support the Harrell's nomination.,24,,
219,0.97,1063.529,1075.407,"As you can see from the appointment packet on the agenda, the nominee has an impressive resume that should serve the Harrell administration well.",24,,
220,0.97,1075.407,1084.083,"Monitoring for low-income housing is vital, to make sure we maximize Taxpayerinvestments.",24,,
221,0.97,1084.083,1088.72,Especially when we're looking to provide as much as quickly as possible.,24,,
222,0.97,1088.72,1091.523,"The Seven-Year, about $40 million per year.",24,,
223,0.97,1091.523,1099.698,And understanding the interface between those funds and the additional millions of dollars from the mandatory Powsing program is vital for success.,24,,
224,0.97,1099.698,1108.907,"On a related note, very pleased, Mayor Harrell expanded deputy Washington's role to include not just affordable housing but also homelessness.",24,,
225,0.97,1108.907,1112.277,Because the priority should be to get the most vulnerable inside.,24,,
226,0.97,1112.277,1119.651,So I believe the Mayor's nominee brings an additional to the table of the homeless policy.,24,,
227,0.97,1119.651,1124.022,This includes having created the tiny home in district 4.,24,,
228,0.97,1124.022,1125.257,This is extremely valuable.,24,,
229,0.97,1125.257,1132.698,"Especially as the Mayor remains Committeed to trying to make available at least 2,000 units of low-income housing this year.",24,,
230,0.97,1132.698,1137.169,Sounds like the executive may be interested in renewing and potentially increasing this property tax.,24,,
231,0.97,1137.169,1138.67,In a couple of years.,24,,
232,0.97,1138.67,1149.548,So it's even more important to have appointees who bring the Holistic view of housing to provide the strongest oversight of this existing levy.,24,,
233,0.97,1149.548,1154.253,I appreciate the Commission of all the members and look forward to voting yes today.,24,,
234,0.97,1154.253,1154.553,Thank you.,24,,
235,0.97,1154.553,1155.42,Excellent.,25,,
236,0.97,1155.42,1159.358,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Pedersen.",25,,
237,0.97,1159.358,1164.696,"Councilmember her bold, go ahead.",25,,
238,0.97,1164.696,1170.302,"And I, too.",26,,
239,0.97,1170.302,1171.77,Wait a second.,27,,
240,0.97,1171.77,1174.473,I'm getting a little background.,27,,
241,0.97,1174.473,1175.674,If the I.T.,27,,
242,0.97,1175.674,1178.31,Team could mute the line.,27,,
243,0.97,1178.31,1178.644,Eric?,27,,
244,0.97,1178.644,1180.078,If the I.T.,27,,
245,0.97,1180.078,1181.18,Team could mute the line.,27,,
246,0.97,1181.18,1183.815,Or if we have a Co-Host that could mute?,27,,
247,0.97,1183.815,1185.05,Just want to give a second.,27,,
248,0.97,1185.05,1188.987,If you could mute your line.,27,,
249,0.97,1188.987,1190.522,[Laughter] I.T.,27,,
250,0.97,1190.522,1191.957,If you could mute your line.,27,,
251,0.97,1191.957,1192.424,Okay.,27,,
252,0.97,1192.424,1194.192,I see them muted.,27,,
253,0.97,1194.192,1194.96,Madam vice chair.,27,,
254,0.97,1194.96,1195.494,Please go ahead.,27,,
255,0.97,1195.494,1196.461,Thank you.,28,,
256,0.97,1196.595,1211.109,"Just again, excited that Cara is willing to play this role on Thouing oversight.",28,,
257,0.97,1211.109,1211.91,Excited about this capacity.,28,,
258,0.97,1211.91,1219.851,"I want to emphasize for the viewing public, this a 13- member oversight committee.",28,,
259,0.97,1219.851,1224.656,"And by design, there are two individuals who represent the city.",28,,
260,0.97,1224.656,1228.594,One that is appointed by the city Council and one by the Mayor.,28,,
261,0.97,1228.594,1232.831,"So by design, we have two city employees on the oversight committee.",28,,
262,0.97,1232.831,1236.234,"Just want to clarify that, in case anybody is wondering.",28,,
263,0.97,1236.234,1236.568,Perfect.,29,,
264,0.97,1236.568,1238.337,"Thank you so much, Cara.",30,,
265,0.97,1238.337,1240.973,"Thank you very much, Madam vice chair.",31,,
266,0.97,1240.973,1242.474,And thank you for lifting that up.,31,,
267,0.97,1242.474,1244.91,I don't think I said it at the beginning.,31,,
268,0.97,1244.91,1245.444,So I appreciate that.,31,,
269,0.97,1245.444,1247.679,Any additional comments or questions?,31,,
270,0.97,1247.679,1247.913,Okay.,31,,
271,0.97,1247.913,1250.582,"Cara, I do have one additional question for you.",31,,
272,0.97,1250.582,1259.391,I'm excited that you brought up your experience with Los Angeles and the Association of cities there.,31,,
273,0.97,1259.391,1271.136,"Any lessons learned obviously from the experience in Los Angeles tied to housing that you might be bringing to this Committee, we do often look up and down the West Coast for ways that we can Replicate good policy.",31,,
274,0.97,1271.136,1279.278,"And also, we will look for ways that we can maybe avoid Pitt falls that other cities have had, when it comes to zoning issues.",31,,
275,0.97,1279.278,1288.186,Any thoughts that you'd like to bring today about how that past experience might help inform the work you have in front of us in the next year and a half?,31,,
276,0.97,1288.186,1288.62,Sure.,32,,
277,0.97,1288.62,1289.321,That's a huge question.,32,,
278,0.97,1289.321,1291.79,"And I think it RAISES many, many important issues.",32,,
279,0.97,1291.99,1303.835,But one of my main Takeaways would be that what I have been impressed with here are the results of the previous levies and all program areas.,32,,
280,0.97,1303.835,1308.24,But especially in addressing the opportunity for equity and homeownership.,32,,
281,0.97,1308.24,1312.711,Something what is out of reach for too many folks.,32,,
282,0.97,1312.711,1318.45,But that the levy has also been focused on preventing displacement.,32,,
283,0.97,1318.45,1328.927,"And that is something that I think what we have seen in California and obviously happening here, too, needs diligence on attention.",32,,
284,0.97,1328.927,1343.241,So I'm looking forward to being part of this effort and also seeing the technical advisory committee get their subject matter expertise to really refine the proposed programs.,32,,
285,0.97,1343.241,1343.875,Excellent.,33,,
286,0.97,1343.875,1346.712,"Well, thank you very much again for that answer.",33,,
287,0.97,1346.712,1359.391,"And it does dovetail nicely with our next item on the agenda, which also, build housing but helps to prevent displacement, by really centering building through the eyes of those who have been most affected by displacement.",33,,
288,0.97,1359.391,1361.359,So I love the tie-in there.,33,,
289,0.97,1361.359,1363.695,I'm not seeing any additional comments or questions.,33,,
290,0.97,1363.695,1367.299,"So colleagues, I'd like to move.",33,,
291,0.97,1367.299,1372.771,"The committee recommend confirmation for the appointment of Cara Vallier, as member of the housing oversight committee.",33,,
292,0.97,1372.771,1373.205,Is there a second?,33,,
293,0.97,1373.205,1374.606,Second.,34,,
294,0.97,1374.606,1375.807,Second.,35,,

297,0.97,1379.344,1382.114,Are there any additional comments or question.,37,,
298,0.97,1382.114,1388.253,"Hearing none, Madam clerk, will you please call roll on the appointment.",38,,
299,0.97,1388.253,1389.087,Councilmember Herbold.,39,,

304,0.97,1400.899,1402.167,The motion carries.,42,,
305,0.97,1402.3,1403.935,"Congratulations, Cara.",42,,
306,0.97,1404.069,1413.678,The committee recommendation that the appointment be confirmed will be sent to the June 21st Seattle meeting for confirmation.,42,,
307,0.97,1413.678,1415.447,Of course you don't need to be present to win.,42,,
308,0.97,1415.447,1418.717,But we'll look forward to seeing your praises there.,42,,
309,0.97,1418.717,1420.786,And we'll highlight the unanimous support.,42,,

319,0.97,1444.876,1450.415,This is a really exciting moment that we collectively have been working on.,46,,
320,0.97,1450.415,1452.918,Both within my office in the last year.,46,,
321,0.97,1452.918,1459.458,"And discussion through the community housing round table, of which we have a few members today.",46,,
322,0.97,1459.458,1462.494,And I would say even longer.,46,,

325,0.97,1474.039,1481.746,"It took our friends at El Centro, as you will hear from Miguel, at least seven years of compiling the funding to get this to the Plaza.",46,,
326,0.97,1481.746,1484.583,And the two beautiful buildings around the Plaza.,46,,
327,0.97,1484.583,1488.72,To get the funding that was needed to begin construction.,46,,
328,0.97,1488.854,1493.725,It's been a Year-Plus of work on this policy specifically.,46,,
329,0.97,1493.725,1501.533,We know that there's been decades of advocacy and organizing and lived experience that has brought us to this moment to want to update our policies.,46,,
330,0.97,1501.533,1507.973,And we're going to do the following order.,46,,
331,0.97,1507.973,1512.377,We're going to first welcome Michael to say a few comments.,46,,
332,0.97,1512.377,1516.348,"And Tracy, we would love to have you walk us through the policy proposal in front of us.",46,,
333,0.97,1516.348,1521.853,And we'll have a panel of folks to talk a little bit about what this policy means.,46,,
334,0.97,1521.853,1525.323,And then we'll open it up for questions and consider legislation.,46,,

358,0.97,1618.616,1621.519,I will just briefly tee up this proposal.,53,,
359,0.97,1621.519,1626.725,"This legislation does come from, again, a lot of the work you have done with your community partners.",53,,
360,0.97,1626.725,1628.326,"Actually, I think over more than just a year.",53,,
361,0.97,1628.326,1646.611,"Feels like just a year, but it's been longer, trying to address this need for Accessing funding to do acquisitions of land and/or buildings in areas at risk of displacement.",53,,
362,0.97,1646.611,1648.38,We drafted this to look back.,53,,
363,0.97,1648.38,1659.991,And to come back that would address this ongoing need for Accessing funding for these acquisitions for small SER newer Community-Based organizations.,53,,
364,0.97,1659.991,1661.092,So O.H.,53,,
365,0.97,1661.092,1662.661,Has provided the appropriate slide response.,53,,
366,0.97,1662.661,1664.829,"And with it, the proposed legislation in front of you.",53,,
367,0.97,1664.829,1667.332,And I think I will have them walk through.,53,,
368,0.97,1667.332,1675.407,"And if there are questions of me or them, we can entertain those after their presentation.",53,,
369,0.97,1675.407,1675.94,Thank you very much.,54,,
370,0.97,1675.94,1689.754,"And as we tee this up, I also want to thank Ann house, who has been working with us on this policy as well.",54,,
371,0.97,1689.754,1705.67,"Tracy Ratliff has been part of that as well again, this is also for you for your support and the unanimous support for implementation.",54,,
372,0.97,1705.67,1714.079,"Jumpstart for housing funding policies as we all know, 62% of the funding does go to affordable housing.",54,,
373,0.97,1714.079,1721.653,"However and from the folks from I.T., if you could tee it up so the presenter from the slides are showing up at the same time.",54,,
374,0.97,1721.653,1731.796,"However, we wanted to make sure war that we really listened to make sure the community who had designed with us, the spend plan.",54,,
375,0.97,1731.796,1750.548,"And part of the priorities from the community and from Councilmembers was to make sure there was permanent acquisition funding along with technical assistance, so that organizers Werible to secure land quickly and the Community-Driven demand for housing quickly.",54,,
376,0.97,1750.548,1759.891,And making sure there was full ownership and Self- determination became more and more of the emphasis as we heard from Community partners.,54,,
377,0.97,1759.891,1767.098,The legislation is as a result of those organizations.,54,,
378,0.97,1767.098,1769.868,Who have begun to enter into more affordable housing.,54,,
379,0.97,1769.868,1772.704,And many of those are with us here today.,54,,
380,0.97,1772.704,1775.807,I just wanted to provide context about where this really came from.,54,,
381,0.97,1775.807,1782.213,"And that this is, as I mentioned yesterday, much more than just the housing.",54,,
382,0.97,1782.213,1785.25,These houses create social cohesion and opportunity for engagement.,54,,
383,0.97,1785.25,1795.226,"They help with the social determinants of health, by making sure they have community gathering spaces.",54,,
384,0.97,1795.226,1797.629,They create economic opportunities and training opportunities.,54,,
385,0.97,1797.629,1810.308,"And they help with opportunities for creating more self-determination for youth and Eldeshes who might be facing isolation, especially in the wake of Covid.",54,,
386,0.97,1810.308,1827.091,"This is a really exciting opportunity for us to meld together, not just fund for example housing units, and not just building more affordable housing but doing so through the vein and through the lens of community development.",54,,
387,0.97,1827.091,1832.63,And Whoa still are most definitely affected by the impacts of housing.,54,,
388,0.97,1832.63,1836.067,I will turn it over to the office of housing to walk us through the presentation.,54,,
389,0.97,1836.067,1842.373,And I may have more comments from some of our guests who are here with us today.,54,,
390,0.97,1842.373,1845.543,But want to get into the meat of the policy.,54,,
391,0.97,1845.543,1851.282,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Mosqueda.",55,,
392,0.97,1851.282,1857.255,So this presentation is in response to city council legislation.,55,,
393,0.97,1857.255,1867.198,Stated here to work with the city Council to develop proposed housing policies to address many of the things that you had just discussed.,55,,
394,0.97,1867.198,1882.146,"Which is really around policy barriers, including partnership requirements for small Community-Based lenders and developers that may have had difficulties Accessing the traditional acquisition and preservation loan program.",55,,
395,0.97,1882.146,1883.514,For the Seattle channel folks.,56,,
396,0.97,1883.514,1892.257,Can we tee up the presentation that is being shared by office of housing?,56,,
397,0.97,1892.257,1894.826,I'm sorry.,57,,
398,0.97,1894.826,1896.527,"Can you repeat that, please?",57,,
399,0.97,1896.527,1902.0,Can we have the screen that is showing the power point presentation?,58,,
400,0.97,1902.0,1909.707,We're on slide number 3. and this is sort of the big Takeaway difference between what we're currently doing and what we're adding.,58,,
401,0.97,1909.707,1912.777,And I think it's a great presentation.,58,,
402,0.97,1912.777,1920.685,I want to make sure that it's being projected on Seattle Channel.,58,,
403,0.97,1920.818,1922.52,"Thank you, director.",58,,
404,0.97,1922.52,1924.923,I think I see it now.,59,,
405,0.97,1924.923,1926.057,Thanks.,60,,
406,0.97,1926.057,1926.724,"Okay, great.",61,,
407,0.97,1926.724,1933.364,"So the current program that we have, you have these four criteria here that are listed under current.",62,,
408,0.97,1933.364,1939.871,You have to have experience developing operating buildings or Partnering with an organization that has that experience.,62,,
409,0.97,1939.871,1947.111,You have to have the ability to secure Perm NENT financing and be on good standing with O.H.,62,,
410,0.97,1947.111,1949.447,Loans F. you are somebody new to this development area.,62,,
411,0.97,1949.447,1951.416,You're not going to have this really.,62,,
412,0.97,1951.416,1951.849,For the most part.,62,,
413,0.97,1951.849,1954.352,Because you have never worked with O.H.,62,,
414,0.97,1954.352,1959.19,And some of these things are just unattainable to you.,62,,
415,0.97,1959.19,1970.601,And that the current program is really driven by the need to have our funds come back to us because we are using levy funds.,62,,
416,0.97,1970.601,1976.274,We're using housing levy funds that are designated for the 20- year operations and maintenance support.,62,,
417,0.97,1976.274,1981.779,And we were using those funds to fund this acquisition program.,62,,
418,0.97,1981.779,1985.55,"Those projects, then, would come back within that five-year period.",62,,
419,0.97,1985.55,1993.124,And have--and the money that was originally paid for this acquisition program would then go back into the O.M.S.,62,,
420,0.97,1993.124,1993.491,Dollars.,62,,
421,0.97,1993.491,2000.098,"And that's why this set of criteria were really, really important for that.",62,,
422,0.97,2000.098,2003.968,What the Jumpstart program allows us to do is to be more flexible on that.,62,,
423,0.97,2003.968,2007.405,These are some of the new criteria for the new program.,62,,
424,0.97,2007.405,2013.244,One is to be a Community-Based organization or community development corporation.,62,,
425,0.97,2013.244,2018.149,Funds are Prioritized for organizations who work directly with vulnerable communities.,62,,
426,0.97,2018.149,2021.953,"Have a development plan in place, within five years, right?",62,,
427,0.97,2021.953,2027.125,You don't need to secure permanent financing by having a sense of plan.,62,,
428,0.97,2027.125,2029.994,Organization housing revenue to exceed $8 million.,62,,
429,0.97,2029.994,2033.865,That is still something that we're exploring.,62,,
430,0.97,2033.865,2044.709,"And documented, but what's really important is the documented board intend to own and operate Multimonth rental and/or affordable homeownership.",62,,
431,0.97,2044.709,2060.391,"The proposal reflects our commitment to the race and Soial justice initiative, for reducing barriers for Community- based to enter the housing sector, particularly for C.E.O.S who have traditionally been excluded.",63,,
432,0.97,2060.391,2066.764,We are lucky in Seattle that weigh have so many Community- based organizations that have done a lot of things over time and really served the community.,63,,
433,0.97,2066.764,2072.203,"But at a certain point, they may want to enter that affordable housing space.",63,,
434,0.97,2072.203,2093.691,"And they're--it's a very challenging market to enter into, because people start looking at balance sheet or past experience and even though they may be longstanding organization decades old and have strong commitment in the work they've done and been successful.",63,,
435,0.97,2093.691,2100.531,"When you enter the affordable housing sector, that experience isn't valued in perhaps the same way I would.",63,,
436,0.97,2100.531,2101.666,The second proposal here.,63,,
437,0.97,2101.666,2112.61,"The second bullet point is that it supports more Community- driven projects to realize and within communities, living within the past and housing discrimination.",63,,
438,0.97,2112.61,2118.616,"The Community-Driven projects, I think if you were to look at the partners that have been funded and that we hope to partner with.",63,,
439,0.97,2118.616,2122.92,Really are doing the housing and work.,63,,
440,0.97,2122.92,2125.423,"I think Councilmember Mosqueda, that you talk about.",63,,
441,0.97,2125.423,2128.326,And it's the bringing of child care facilities.,63,,
442,0.97,2128.326,2135.366,"Small businesses, all of those things that we want to see in housing and our great elements of the community.",63,,
443,0.97,2135.366,2147.712,But also these organizations in these communities may have been restricted by the housing discrimination that organizations such as the city of Seattle has perpetuated over time.,63,,
444,0.97,2147.712,2148.513,"Next slide, please.",63,,
445,0.97,2148.513,2153.117,"So the Jumpstart opportunity, as we've said, you know.",64,,
446,0.97,2153.117,2159.023,The current program really comes from a temporary fund source I've described earlier.,64,,
447,0.97,2159.023,2165.563,Ask this new payroll expense tax creates a new and permanent acquisition space for loans.,64,,
448,0.97,2165.563,2169.767,Also allows us to have technical assistance in capacity.,64,,
449,0.97,2169.767,2178.776,"Funds to support the Community- based organizations, so they have some of the thought and the skills necessary to make the decisions that are best for themselves.",64,,
450,0.97,2178.91,2183.314,Outside of the financial structure that they're forced to enter into.,64,,
451,0.97,2183.447,2193.391,It allows for different eligibility for different loan sources and allows equity practices.,64,,
452,0.97,2193.391,2201.999,I would say some of the lending practices that exist out in the world are not necessarily all that equitable.,64,,
453,0.97,2201.999,2211.242,"Phase 1 of the capacity and grant program is, would allow us to work with a third-party intermediary.",64,,
454,0.97,2211.242,2220.351,"And we are planning on giving out $250,000 grants for training and Predevelopment expenses that are tied to projects.",64,,
455,0.97,2220.484,2233.464,"And then phase 2 is acquisition and development program, where organizations that complete phase 1 will be eligible to apply for Jumpstart a & amp; P loans.",64,,
456,0.97,2233.464,2238.569,Which will be competitively awarded and reviewed through standard O.H.,64,,
457,0.97,2238.569,2238.903,Procedures.,64,,
458,0.97,2238.903,2248.713,"And the organizations that are doing that will be eligible for up to $500,000, additional developer fee to earn.",64,,
459,0.97,2248.713,2253.484,To support the infrastructure during this time.,64,,
460,0.97,2253.484,2258.255,"So the Jumpstart a & amp; P program, if you look at the Jumpstart legislation.",64,,
461,0.97,2258.255,2270.334,"16% of available Jumpstart revenue, for housing and services, Jumpstart revenue, available for housing services to support Anti-Displacement work, including acquisition permanent development and financing.",64,,
462,0.97,2270.334,2275.673,"Based on the current Jumpstart amount, we're estimating that to be $15 million.",64,,
463,0.97,2275.673,2283.881,"And of that $15 million, $2 million would annually be set aside to administer the capacity and grant program.",64,,
464,0.97,2284.015,2293.491,"And the partner organizations, as we look back at who our potential partner organizations.",64,,
465,0.97,2293.491,2297.194,It would be some of the organizations that are listed here.,64,,
466,0.97,2297.328,2300.698,And that is the end of the slide deck.,64,,
467,0.97,2300.698,2302.833,Okay.,65,,
468,0.97,2302.833,2303.1,Wonderful.,65,,
469,0.97,2303.1,2306.671,"Well, we do have some community partners here with us today.",65,,
470,0.97,2306.671,2312.109,"Kelli, I just wanted to make sure if there was anything else you wanted to add from O.H.",65,,
471,0.97,2312.109,2312.376,Wonderful.,65,,
472,0.97,2312.376,2319.083,We're going to go ahead and hear directly for some of the folks who have been calling for this type of action for the last few years.,65,,
473,0.97,2319.083,2325.089,And I want to welcome Miguel Maestas from El Centro.,65,,
474,0.97,2325.089,2333.431,"And he'll be followed by Jamie Lee and the team and Velma, Agnes and Rick from Filipino community center.",65,,
475,0.97,2333.431,2334.865,"If you don't mind, comment a little more.",65,,
476,0.97,2334.999,2342.239,I Teed up a little more of the work you have done for the Plaza.,65,,
477,0.97,2342.239,2345.81,But if you could talk about creating affordable housing.,65,,
478,0.97,2345.81,2349.814,Maybe how your organization decided to get into this world.,65,,
479,0.97,2349.814,2353.05,And then the challenges you experienced with the funding.,65,,
480,0.97,2353.05,2361.425,"I I'd like to hear more about the time, the length of time it took you to get the projects for the few that that we're looking at.",65,,
481,0.97,2361.425,2367.698,"If this Jump-Start community, self-determination Fund, how does that title sound?",65,,
482,0.97,2367.698,2368.499,Jump-Start self-determination Fund.,65,,
483,0.97,2368.499,2369.233,If it would have been in place.,65,,
484,0.97,2369.233,2375.84,How do you think that might have helped you in the past or for future projects.,65,,
485,0.97,2375.84,2380.344,"Again, how do you welcome, Miguel?",65,,
486,0.97,2380.344,2387.418,"Councilmember Mosqueda and others, thank you so much for the opportunity to share this morning and talk about and support the Jumpstart fund legislation.",66,,
487,0.97,2387.551,2394.358,"On behalf of everyone at El Centro Delaraza, the center for people of all races.",66,,
488,0.97,2394.358,2402.8,We appreciate the opportunity to share about our experience with the development of Plaza Roberto Maestas.,66,,
489,0.97,2402.8,2410.908,"You know, back in 2003 when, you know, word was coming that the light rail would be coming to beacon Hill.",66,,
490,0.97,2410.908,2415.212,"And actually, it wasn't supposed to come to beacon Hill initially.",66,,
491,0.97,2415.212,2432.797,"But when it was determined that a stop would be on beacon Hill, obviously El Centro, we saw, we began to learn about the opportunity to do a Mixed-Use, affordable housing development.",66,,
492,0.97,2432.93,2436.367,"Many people wanted to come to purchase the land, develop the land.",66,,
493,0.97,2436.367,2450.381,"And we realized that we had to learn and develop our own capacity, to develop property that already belonged to El Centro Delaraza as quickly as we could.",66,,
494,0.97,2450.381,2465.796,"We knew this was an opportunity to expand our ability to carry out our Mig, to do our part as an Organizaton, to respond to the affordable housing crisis that was already taking hold in our community.",66,,
495,0.97,2465.796,2475.272,And so we began to organize and participate in neighborhood meetings in the planning meetings for beacon Hill.,66,,
496,0.97,2475.272,2486.483,And really make sure that community was engaged and talking about what kind of development we wanted to bring on beacon Hill.,66,,
497,0.97,2486.483,2487.885,Obviously including affordable housing.,66,,
498,0.97,2487.885,2492.79,"So it took--that was a long process that took many, many years.",66,,
499,0.97,2492.79,2498.262,Probably about six years of just participating and learning.,66,,
500,0.97,2498.262,2521.385,"And finally, in 2003, when we other than pretty clear about what we wanted to do, you know, and began to engage in partners and development consultants and Plaza Roberto Maestas, obviously named in honor of Roberto Maestas, was named in part of those initial discussions and visions, before he passed away, in 2010.",66,,
501,0.97,2521.385,2525.389,And what came--and then finally broke ground in 2016.,66,,
502,0.97,2525.389,2549.68,"So, you know, it was an incredible, incredibly long journey and a tremendous amount of work for our organization to grow the capacity, to have--to put in place the good financial systems, the data tracking, improve our technology, so that we would be able to be competitive for the funding to be able to do this mixed use development.",66,,
503,0.97,2549.68,2560.624,"And I also want to--you know, so it was an incredible amount of work over a long period of time before really thinking about that vision to actually breaking ground in 2016.",66,,
504,0.97,2560.624,2566.03,And I do want to share a little bit about our model.,66,,
505,0.97,2566.03,2572.803,"Because Obviously, our model of affordable housing is, as Councilmember Mosqueda mentioned, is a mixed use.",66,,
506,0.97,2572.803,2577.608,And it really is about building community and creating a sense of community.,66,,
507,0.97,2577.608,2586.717,"And not doing affordable housing as a Stand-Alone, but in making sure that it's part of other elements that support community, like child care.",66,,
508,0.97,2586.717,2593.223,The small business and economic development part of the development.,66,,
509,0.97,2593.223,2596.694,The community and cultural space that are part of that development.,66,,
510,0.97,2596.694,2604.168,So that not only people who are going to live there and work there and have their small businesses there.,66,,
511,0.97,2604.168,2610.708,But the entire neighborhood and city see it as an asset.,66,,
512,0.97,2610.708,2620.751,And that everyone SEES that there is something there for them.,66,,
513,0.97,2620.751,2626.623,Or something there that benefits the community.,66,,
514,0.97,2626.623,2631.228,Like restaurants and shops.,66,,
515,0.97,2631.228,2632.93,The station coffee shop.,66,,
516,0.97,2632.93,2633.63,Cultural space.,66,,
517,0.97,2633.63,2635.566,The event space.,66,,
518,0.97,2635.566,2639.403,The amenities to bring community together.,66,,
519,0.97,2639.403,2644.942,And so building those aspects are also very challenging as well.,66,,
520,0.97,2644.942,2651.081,So you asked what this fund or what this legislation would have meant.,66,,
521,0.97,2651.081,2662.559,It would have been incredibly valuable to us because obviously this was a process where we were learning and didn't have a lot of funds dedicated to this.,66,,
522,0.97,2662.559,2673.47,"Fortunately, we did, we were able to have some funds that we had set aside from the construction, or leasing out the space to sound transit to develop the light rail.",66,,
523,0.97,2673.47,2677.174,"But you know, those funds were limited as well.",66,,
524,0.97,2677.174,2686.183,So this--we've often talked about what it means to build capacity.,66,,
525,0.97,2686.183,2702.199,"Many, many organizations churches Community-Based organizations, have come to El Centro to ask us about our lessons learned for what we could share, because of their desire to use land that we have, to build affordable housing.",66,,
526,0.97,2702.199,2706.003,We always share our knowledge and share anything that we can.,66,,
527,0.97,2706.003,2710.34,Because we remember how hard and how long of a process it was for us.,66,,
528,0.97,2710.34,2712.209,So we share policies.,66,,
529,0.97,2712.209,2712.91,We share contacts.,66,,
530,0.97,2712.91,2715.212,As part of just supporting that.,66,,
531,0.97,2715.212,2723.387,"Because as we know, and as part of this legislation, there's many groups out there.",66,,
532,0.97,2723.387,2731.195,Many organizations that have their own land and want to be part of the response to the affordable housing prices.,66,,
533,0.97,2731.195,2736.7,But this is--but it is a capacity issue so many times.,66,,
534,0.97,2736.7,2752.149,And then the other part about raising the funds for other elements as well is even more difficult at times than raising the funds for affordable housing.,66,,
535,0.97,2752.149,2755.319,When you look at the commercial space.,66,,
536,0.97,2755.319,2755.919,The child development space.,66,,
537,0.97,2755.919,2774.171,"The entities that don't have that funding and a huge lift and a huge part of developing capacity, El Centro, our example, we had to do the largest capital campaign in our history to be able to pay for those commercial entities and those communities and cultural expenses as well.",66,,
538,0.97,2774.304,2780.477,And we know we'll never do a development that just is affordable housing.,66,,
539,0.97,2780.477,2788.318,It has to have those other parts and those other elements to really build and support community.,66,,
540,0.97,2788.318,2806.47,"So--and finally, I'll mention that the need--it was very Fortuitous that we had the land, but acquiring new land to do affordable housing for small organizations that are just, you know, have limited capacity to do affordable housing is incredibly challenging.",66,,
541,0.97,2806.47,2816.48,So the support for acquisition here is invaluable and will really help organizations develop their capacity.,66,,
542,0.97,2816.48,2823.787,"So I will close by just saying that, you know, that it also strengthens organizations.",66,,
543,0.97,2823.787,2849.246,"And it has helped El Centro be in a place where we know, as an organization, we will be providing growing assets and providing support and housing for our community for generations to come because the organization is much stronger, much more financially stable and has now assets that can continue to serve the community for many, many years to come.",66,,
544,0.97,2849.246,2850.013,Thank you.,66,,
545,0.97,2850.013,2850.948,Excellent.,67,,
546,0.97,2850.948,2852.015,"Thank you very much, Miguel.",67,,
547,0.97,2852.015,2860.157,And thank you for sharing the story on behalf of El Centro.,67,,
548,0.97,2860.157,2866.163,I'm also glad you invoked Roberto's name and the help that he had in the Plaza.,67,,
549,0.97,2866.163,2870.0,Based on some of the early planning that you all did together.,67,,
550,0.97,2870.0,2872.302,"And the experience of El Centro is not unique, right?",67,,
551,0.97,2872.302,2882.045,So I'm going to turn it over to Jamie Lee next to talk a little bit about their experience in the Chinatown International district.,67,,
552,0.97,2882.045,2882.412,"Welcome, Jamie.",67,,
553,0.97,2882.412,2882.813,Good morning.,68,,
554,0.97,2882.813,2884.047,Thank you.,68,,
555,0.97,2884.047,2889.519,"And thank you, Councilmembers for inviting me to be here today.",68,,
556,0.97,2889.519,2894.791,"As Councilmember Mosqueda said, I'm Jamie Lee and I'm with the development authority.",68,,
557,0.97,2894.791,2896.827,We're in the Chinatown I.D.,68,,
558,0.97,2896.827,2900.664,I feel like Miguel really did hit a lot on things I'm going to talk about.,68,,
559,0.97,2900.664,2901.898,So point of agreement there.,68,,
560,0.97,2901.898,2908.939,"So for those of you who don't know who we are, as my former boss would say, we are a Cousin to affordable housing development.",68,,
561,0.97,2908.939,2912.276,We have been in existence for about 47 years.,68,,
562,0.97,2912.276,2916.88,And we actually started out in affordable housing development and management.,68,,
563,0.97,2916.88,2922.019,We currently own and/or develop seven buildings in the Chinatown I.D.,68,,
564,0.97,2922.019,2923.52,Similar to what Miguel discussed.,68,,
565,0.97,2923.52,2925.722,We not only consider the housing.,68,,
566,0.97,2925.722,2931.161,But we also consider how our residents are going to live within the project.,68,,
567,0.97,2931.161,2935.499,And I think that underscores at this time importance of the work you're going to hear.,68,,
568,0.97,2935.499,2938.869,"From me, Miguel, others on the call today.",68,,
569,0.97,2938.869,2941.538,"You know, right now, there are two projects under way.",68,,
570,0.97,2941.538,2943.307,One is under construction.,68,,
571,0.97,2943.307,2946.543,The other one would be set to close this summer.,68,,
572,0.97,2946.543,2953.05,But it's been about 15 years since we had developed a new project.,68,,
573,0.97,2953.05,2958.388,"Over the years, they have attempted to acquire land in the Chinatown I.D.",68,,
574,0.97,2958.388,2959.323,And with little success.,68,,
575,0.97,2959.323,2966.997,"Our projects now, as well as the one actually, we did about 15 years ago now, were not acquired on the open market.",68,,
576,0.97,2966.997,2974.905,"They were acquired through other methods, whether it be through us being a public development authority or through other forms of working with government to actually acquire this land.",68,,
577,0.97,2975.038,2986.55,"And we've put multiple offers on properties over the years, but lost out for a variety of reasons, from timing to funding to readiness.",68,,
578,0.97,2986.55,2997.26,"We hope that this Jumpstart funding will allow us to continue to develop in our neighborhood, where parcels are quickly being bought out.",68,,
579,0.97,2997.26,3008.271,"It would not only be advantageous that this be for smaller C.E.O.S, but would be more flexible with eligibility criteria.",68,,
580,0.97,3008.271,3013.577,"As we all know, financing is difficult and highly scrutinized.",68,,
581,0.97,3013.577,3022.719,And I echo what Miguel said about developing the ground floor commercial and really making that an important piece of the project in what we're doing.,68,,
582,0.97,3022.719,3031.328,"And when I think about what a lot of this funding funds, in this really important piece of how we want to develop our projects.",68,,
583,0.97,3031.328,3034.831,Just to make sure that we develop great housing and great commercial space.,68,,
584,0.97,3034.831,3041.438,And that we're able to bring in businesses that really do reflect our community and also need those resources as well.,68,,
585,0.97,3041.438,3046.009,So we really hope that this funding helps break down those barriers.,68,,
586,0.97,3046.009,3055.419,"And a little smaller, less experienced organizations like us, to be able to develop on our own, how we would like to be able to develop.",68,,
587,0.97,3055.419,3066.396,"I think this phase 1 capacity, as well as the phase 2 developer fee will allow us to confidently develop our capacity within our organization and not build it on a dream and hoping that funding will come through.",68,,
588,0.97,3066.396,3072.169,And that we will be able to pay our staff beyond 12 to 16 months.,68,,
589,0.97,3072.169,3072.436,You know.,68,,
590,0.97,3072.436,3075.972,"It will really help us to say, you know, we can do this project.",68,,
591,0.97,3075.972,3077.841,We can really build our capacity.,68,,
592,0.97,3077.841,3082.379,"This is something we can stick with, which is often a question that we have.",68,,
593,0.97,3082.379,3088.552,"And something that we kind of did as we developed, as we worked toward staffing, to develop the projects that we're currently working on.",68,,
594,0.97,3088.552,3093.19,"And I think that is something that is, I really appreciated seeing that in this legislation.",68,,
595,0.97,3093.19,3096.293,I think that it is something that we think about internally.,68,,
596,0.97,3096.293,3102.699,How can we build our capacity to not only have the staff that we need.,68,,
597,0.97,3102.699,3109.406,But also build kind of the expertise and within our community with the staff that we have.,68,,
598,0.97,3109.406,3115.245,And the one that we want to build so that we can have folks within our staff that can do this work that look like us.,68,,
599,0.97,3115.245,3116.079,That are capable.,68,,
600,0.97,3116.079,3121.384,"And that we have, you know, more developers of color and folks that have that experience coming through.",68,,
601,0.97,3121.518,3128.592,"I do want to impress upon you, the importance of the dedicated acquisition funding that is in here.",68,,
602,0.97,3128.592,3134.531,"I think that, you know, we all know that land is getting snatched up quickly within the Chinatown I.D.",68,,
603,0.97,3134.531,3139.936,It takes a great deal of resources within our organization to get to the other end of the acquisition funding.,68,,
604,0.97,3139.936,3146.076,"And it is often subject to funding time lines, which doesn't always align for when land is for sale.",68,,
605,0.97,3146.076,3150.113,So I think that this would really help within that.,68,,
606,0.97,3150.113,3158.388,"And you know, it feels as if one of the most critical issues in regards to community control of land and getting that first step.",68,,
607,0.97,3158.388,3163.527,And I do appreciate the space after acquisition to develop a development plan.,68,,
608,0.97,3163.527,3172.669,I think it was five years and to really help us give us the space and time to even compete with the open market this year in Seattle.,68,,
609,0.97,3172.669,3180.143,"So just to close, I just want to say, we get to look forward to working with Council in the office of housing on this program.",68,,
610,0.97,3180.143,3182.479,And to being a critical partner on this work.,68,,
611,0.97,3182.479,3185.916,And welcome to have us at the table any time you will be there.,68,,
612,0.97,3185.916,3186.65,So thank you very much.,68,,
613,0.97,3186.783,3193.156,We will continue to take you up on the opportunity to be at that table with you.,69,,
614,0.97,3193.156,3200.03,Because so many great ideas have been generated from the community directly on how we can make improvements.,69,,
615,0.97,3200.03,3206.303,And you and Miguel mentioned the need to make sure that we move quickly for land that is available.,69,,
616,0.97,3206.303,3207.737,We know that that's the experience as well.,69,,
617,0.97,3207.737,3210.473,When it comes to the Filipino community center.,69,,
618,0.97,3210.473,3216.613,And I'm wondering if I could turn it over to the team that is here with us from the Filipino community center.,69,,
619,0.97,3216.613,3219.182,To talk a little about your past experience.,69,,
620,0.97,3219.182,3223.987,And some items you have on the horizon and how this might be helpful.,69,,
621,0.97,3223.987,3226.89,Or any additional comments you would like to make.,69,,
622,0.97,3226.89,3231.061,And just want to welcome board member.,69,,
623,0.97,3231.061,3240.503,"And former representative Velma Valoria, and community Organizer who came off of mute that day, and emphasized the importance of this policy more than a year ago.",69,,
624,0.97,3240.503,3243.607,So thank you and welcome to the Filipino community center team here.,69,,
625,0.97,3243.74,3248.278,Thank you.,70,,
626,0.97,3248.411,3255.418,"Councilmember Mosqueda, and members of the committee.",70,,
627,0.97,3255.418,3257.487,My name is Velma Valoria.,70,,
628,0.97,3257.487,3259.255,I'm a former state representative.,70,,
629,0.97,3259.255,3262.826,And I'm here representing the Filipino community of Seattle.,70,,
630,0.97,3262.826,3264.661,I just wanted to say thank you.,70,,
631,0.97,3264.661,3275.505,"And wanted to testify on the Council bill, 12034.",70,,
632,0.97,3275.505,3279.743,We call that affordable Jumpstart housing funding program.,70,,
633,0.97,3279.743,3280.143,It's a new one.,70,,
634,0.97,3280.143,3283.947,It's Stitle a little long.,70,,
635,0.97,3283.947,3284.481,But anyway.,70,,
636,0.97,3284.614,3290.286,Saying they're a small organization.,70,,
637,0.97,3290.286,3293.089,"We are a very mini, mini organization.",70,,
638,0.97,3293.089,3300.063,So I've wanted to let you know about the experience that we have had.,70,,
639,0.97,3300.063,3308.538,"As you know, Argnes said, that we did have our opening of our Filipino community village.",70,,
640,0.97,3308.538,3317.38,We are now ready to work with the afford--to work on affordable housing for families.,70,,
641,0.97,3317.38,3320.684,Let me tell you our experience.,70,,
642,0.97,3320.684,3327.424,We have a land owner that was ready to sell his piece of land.,70,,
643,0.97,3327.424,3334.364,That land owner offered us the opportunity for first refusal to buy the property.,70,,
644,0.97,3334.497,3349.813,"As we applied for funding from the city for land acquisition, we found that their requirement was to have at least three previously built housing projects.",70,,
645,0.97,3349.813,3353.75,"You know, the Filipino community does not have three housing projects.",70,,
646,0.97,3353.75,3356.953,We only have one that has been recently built.,70,,
647,0.97,3356.953,3364.527,And we did not have the $2.3 million to buy the land.,70,,
648,0.97,3364.527,3379.743,"What was really, really helpful was Councilmember Mosqueda's Jumpstart acquisition for land funding.",70,,
649,0.97,3379.743,3384.914,"And so we--with this ordinance, I think we will be the first one to use it.",70,,
650,0.97,3384.914,3393.523,"And within less than a year, we would have funding to buy that piece of property.",70,,
651,0.97,3393.523,3398.828,We have already put our proposal in front of the land owner.,70,,
652,0.97,3398.828,3400.697,And we're working to make sure that it comes through.,70,,
653,0.97,3400.83,3410.14,So this piece of legislation will actually allow us to buy that piece of land.,70,,
654,0.97,3410.14,3423.72,And now allow us to concentrate on making sure that we do build that capacity and that we do have that time to work with our developer to make our plans a reality.,70,,
655,0.97,3423.853,3442.539,"So I wanted to say thank you for your innovation in creating that Jumpstart program, as well as our need to fill--to fulfill our need for this housing project.",70,,
656,0.97,3442.539,3444.44,"So once again, thank you very much.",70,,
657,0.97,3444.44,3449.145,And we are really looking forward to have this piece of ordinance passed immediately.,70,,
658,0.97,3449.279,3451.381,Thank you.,70,,
659,0.97,3451.381,3452.782,Thank you very much.,71,,
660,0.97,3452.916,3461.858,Board member Polateen or board member Agnes Novarro.,71,,
661,0.97,3461.858,3462.492,Go ahead.,71,,
662,0.97,3462.492,3463.059,Please go ahead.,71,,
663,0.97,3463.059,3464.427,Hi.,72,,
664,0.97,3464.561,3472.769,I fully support what Agnes Novarro and Velma Volario just said.,72,,
665,0.97,3472.769,3479.375,"Well, good morning, chairman Teresa Mosqueda and members of the committee.",72,,
666,0.97,3479.375,3482.245,My name is Rick Valentar.,72,,
667,0.97,3482.245,3485.748,I'm a board member in Seattle.,72,,
668,0.97,3485.748,3497.594,And also for Asian Pacific [inaudible] the Filipino community is in dire need for an affordable low-cost housing for working families.,72,,
669,0.97,3497.594,3503.333,We are not exempt from the increasing homelessness and demand for affordable housing in the area.,72,,
670,0.97,3503.466,3514.043,So we're in full support of this ordinance that you are working on.,72,,
671,0.97,3514.043,3517.914,"Thank you, members of this Committee, for making this happen.",72,,
672,0.97,3517.914,3530.46,"This would make sure that Bipoc organizations, such as the Filipino community will be able to participate in building an affordable low-cost housing for working families.",72,,
673,0.97,3530.46,3544.407,"Recently, we were able to successfully build as the other family said, officially open the affordable housing for seniors.",72,,
674,0.97,3544.407,3552.348,"The Filipino village 1. which is, by the way, now 100% occupied.",72,,
675,0.97,3552.348,3556.352,This show that our organization could build efficiently.,72,,
676,0.97,3556.352,3560.356,And have senior housing in the community.,72,,
677,0.97,3560.356,3565.728,And additional land like Velma said was offered to us to be for sale.,72,,
678,0.97,3565.728,3577.307,"And with the city's health, we'll be able to purchase this slot to build an affordable housing for working families.",72,,
679,0.97,3577.307,3584.38,And now reaching our dream of building housing for working families.,72,,
680,0.97,3584.38,3613.743,"So again, thank you for making this happen and we on we look forward to working with you in making sure that we do expand affordable housing in the city of Seattle and making sure that Cbos, like the Filipino community can really participate in helping address these dire needs.",72,,
681,0.97,3613.743,3615.278,Thank you very much.,72,,
682,0.97,3615.278,3616.879,Thank you very much.,73,,
683,0.97,3616.879,3625.822,"And it was wonderful to see you last week, board member Polatan at the Filipino community celebration as well.",73,,
684,0.97,3625.822,3631.594,"And Agnes, anything else you would like to add?",73,,
685,0.97,3631.594,3632.095,As executive director?,73,,
686,0.97,3632.095,3634.497,"Thank you, Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda.",74,,
687,0.97,3634.497,3643.439,I just wanted to make sure that we want to thank you very much for all the help that you've given us.,74,,
688,0.97,3643.439,3666.029,"And that I will let you--I'm telling everyone that our mission and vision actually includes affordable housing for our community, the people in the Rainier Valley, which is mostly affected by the rising cost of housing in Seattle.",74,,
689,0.97,3666.029,3669.365,The rents are also rising in Seattle.,74,,
690,0.97,3669.365,3674.804,Which this will definitely prevent Displacements of our people.,74,,
691,0.97,3674.804,3677.34,And this will be also a mixed use.,74,,
692,0.97,3677.34,3680.109,It's not only for housing.,74,,
693,0.97,3680.109,3686.082,But it is also for--it's a Multigenerational activities.,74,,
694,0.97,3686.082,3707.37,"You know, for our plan is to build another, common space or community space, a child development center and some commercial Stace spaces, which we can offer culturally appropriate activities and services.",74,,
695,0.97,3707.37,3707.77,That's about it.,74,,
696,0.97,3707.77,3708.571,Thank you very much.,74,,
697,0.97,3708.571,3711.908,"And hopefully this will pass, because this will really help us build our next project.",74,,
698,0.97,3712.041,3715.678,Excellent.,75,,
699,0.97,3715.678,3716.179,Thank you very much.,75,,
700,0.97,3716.312,3722.819,"And colleagues, I am going to turn it to you for any questions or comments.",75,,
701,0.97,3722.819,3726.823,Both for the panel and for central staff or housing.,75,,
702,0.97,3726.823,3732.695,"I want to thank the Africa town community center, who could not be with us today because of flight delay.",75,,
703,0.97,3732.695,3737.9,But want to lift up the words from the folks at Africa community housing and development.,75,,
704,0.97,3738.034,3748.077,"Bree Nicholero sent us a message that says, I also share your Excitementaround the jump start.",75,,
705,0.97,3748.077,3758.187,"A community development plan, which will provide critical opportunities to Community-Led community housing and ICA development, who are working to grow our development portfolio.",75,,
706,0.97,3758.187,3767.096,"As we do not have access to major donors or other resources that mainstream organizations leverage, to initiate their community development work.",75,,
707,0.97,3767.096,3781.41,"This program would provide a vital investment in our ability to provide high-quality, Family- sized Townhomes and Row houses with affordable mortgages, priced at 50% of the area median income, that meet Islamic Finance requirements.",75,,
708,0.97,3781.41,3790.82,"Our goal is to invest in urban infill model design as a limited equity homeownership cooperative, that we can use throughout King County.",75,,
709,0.97,3790.82,3793.489,I want to thank them for their support and their comments as well.,75,,
710,0.97,3793.623,3803.432,Before we turn over to Councilmembers and I see Councilmember director.,75,,
711,0.97,3803.432,3809.005,First is there anything else you would like to add to the presentation here?,75,,
712,0.97,3809.005,3809.872,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",76,,
713,0.97,3809.872,3813.309,I have a little bit of a challenge with this whole topic.,76,,
714,0.97,3813.309,3815.611,Because I'm feeling a little emotionally tied to it.,76,,
715,0.97,3815.611,3817.046,Just a little bit too close to it.,76,,
716,0.97,3817.046,3827.356,I think what you heard from all the organizations here is that it Hab a Strugle for them to access funding from the office of housing.,76,,
717,0.97,3827.49,3834.23,"But from that, you hear strong resilience and determination.",76,,
718,0.97,3834.23,3840.102,There is an Intentionality in which they've made these decisions to which they enter the space.,76,,
719,0.97,3840.102,3842.171,In which the affordable housing and elements.,76,,
720,0.97,3842.171,3844.34,And what does this mean for them as an organization?,76,,
721,0.97,3844.34,3848.377,It's not that they all want to be affordable housing developers.,76,,
722,0.97,3848.377,3849.712,That's just part of their mission.,76,,
723,0.97,3849.712,3852.782,And that's how they live out their mission.,76,,
724,0.97,3852.782,3856.152,So I think the Intentionality around that is great.,76,,
725,0.97,3856.152,3860.189,What I appreciate about the Council's work on this is that it is a path.,76,,
726,0.97,3860.189,3867.396,It leads to a path and a conversation and some strategic decisions made within organizations.,76,,
727,0.97,3867.396,3870.466,And that's sometimes a real challenge to actually resource.,76,,
728,0.97,3870.466,3872.368,And what does that look like?,76,,
729,0.97,3872.368,3881.577,And what this does is helps set organizations on a path so that they can access our traditional funds of dollars.,76,,
730,0.97,3881.577,3886.749,"Which, honestly, the--some of the other funding sources make it really challenging to do that.",76,,
731,0.97,3886.749,3887.85,I'll just leave it at that.,76,,
732,0.97,3887.85,3892.588,So I will be quiet now and be happy to take questions.,76,,
733,0.97,3892.588,3892.955,Excellent.,77,,
734,0.97,3892.955,3894.957,"Well, we really appreciate it.",77,,
735,0.97,3894.957,3910.172,"And honestly, the office of housing, under your stewardship and under the previous director and team there, really have been great partners with us in developing the policy here and want to thank the office of housing team for your partnership.",77,,
736,0.97,3910.172,3916.779,"And green, Tracy rat cliff for your creative thoughts as well.",77,,
737,0.97,3916.779,3918.981,As we sought to change the policy.,77,,
738,0.97,3918.981,3920.416,So thank you so much.,77,,
739,0.97,3920.416,3928.257,We're going to first turn it over to Councilmember Nelson and Councilmember Pedersen is next.,77,,
740,0.97,3928.257,3928.724,Councilmember Nelson.,77,,
741,0.97,3928.724,3929.091,Thank you.,78,,
742,0.97,3929.091,3930.893,I am fully in support of this.,78,,
743,0.97,3930.893,3940.67,"And I really do appreciate you bringing this forward and for the community, advocating for this over the course of years.",78,,
744,0.97,3940.67,3959.822,"And your presence here really did, really did bring home why this is so important from representative Valoria's example are not having enough--not having the required number of developments already completed to access money.",78,,
745,0.97,3959.822,3970.399,"I mean, getting cash in the hands of people that need it to support community is a goal of mine when it comes to small businesses.",78,,
746,0.97,3970.399,3973.903,And this is what this is doing.,78,,
747,0.97,3973.903,3978.908,And it sounds--it sounds like this is Effectuating a policy.,78,,
748,0.97,3978.908,3982.712,And this is where I have a question.,78,,
749,0.97,3982.712,3985.648,That I've been interested in advancing.,78,,
750,0.97,3985.648,3991.187,Which is that it allows for these funds to be used on the ground floor.,78,,
751,0.97,3991.187,3996.959,Which will prevent the displacement of neighborhood small businesses.,78,,
752,0.97,3996.959,4006.235,"Because often, my understanding has been that the current policy that the office of housing funding can only be used for the residential units above.",78,,
753,0.97,4006.235,4011.674,"Unless there is a community benefit space, such as in pride place.",78,,
754,0.97,4011.674,4017.747,"For the nonprofit that was operating on the ground floor, Gen pride.",78,,
755,0.97,4017.747,4027.356,"My purpose is that this is going to help small businesses in the community, who are often displaced when store fronts are Consolidated, when they're acquired for affordable housing.",78,,
756,0.97,4027.356,4029.592,And it will also help businesses move in.,78,,
757,0.97,4029.592,4035.831,Because my understanding is that some of the repairs and the preparation for the space will be possible.,78,,
758,0.97,4035.831,4038.034,So I really appreciate what this is doing.,78,,
759,0.97,4038.034,4038.868,So thank you very much.,78,,
760,0.97,4038.868,4042.772,"Thank you very much, council member Nelson.",79,,
761,0.97,4042.772,4050.78,And I just wanted to offer the chance if Tracy Ratzcliff wanted to add to that.,79,,
762,0.97,4050.78,4073.035,"We, I think, in 2018 and 2019, did work with the office of housing at the time to try to pair more of the housing funds with the equity initiative funds to make it possible to be a better Melding of those dollars, which is, as you mentioned, a real experience for folks who are either trying to build housing or create community or small business space on the first or second floor.",79,,
763,0.97,4073.035,4077.206,So that also came up on the community housing Roundtable.,79,,
764,0.97,4077.206,4080.376,Did you have anything to add in response?,79,,
765,0.97,4080.376,4080.943,I did.,80,,
766,0.97,4080.943,4082.344,I just wanted to be clear about this.,80,,
767,0.97,4082.478,4087.116,The housing dollars can only be used for the housing.,80,,
768,0.97,4087.116,4091.02,And for spaces related to the provision of housing.,80,,
769,0.97,4091.02,4092.254,Councilmember Nelson is correct.,80,,
770,0.97,4092.254,4098.594,If there is community space in the bottom of a housing that is directly tied to providing services to the housing residents.,80,,
771,0.97,4098.594,4100.763,That can be used and funded with housing dollars.,80,,
772,0.97,4100.763,4114.109,"But if you have a separate space that is a, you know, For- profit, subway sandwich shop or some other unrelated business or business that is directly related to the House provision.",80,,
773,0.97,4114.109,4116.712,Then housing dollars can't be used for that activity.,80,,
774,0.97,4116.712,4121.75,"And that is, in fact, where things like the E.D.I.",80,,
775,0.97,4121.75,4126.922,And private financing most frequently have to come in to help to fund that space for those small businesses.,80,,
776,0.97,4126.922,4132.995,So want to be really clear that housing dollars have to be used for housing.,80,,
777,0.97,4132.995,4134.997,And services related to provision of services.,80,,
778,0.97,4134.997,4138.2,"But cannot be used for business space, for example.",80,,
779,0.97,4138.2,4141.37,And just to add to that.,81,,
780,0.97,4141.37,4144.874,I see hand up as well.,81,,
781,0.97,4144.874,4157.286,Is there any additional elaboration that you can provide to the vision that I share as well that we want to make sure that there is a Pairing of policies.,81,,
782,0.97,4157.286,4158.42,Pairing of funding.,81,,
783,0.97,4158.42,4160.389,Those funding sources.,81,,
784,0.97,4160.389,4164.26,So that the small businesses.,81,,
785,0.97,4164.26,4170.533,"That women in Minority-Owned businesses along with child care on the first and second floors, and that have housing above it is possible.",81,,
786,0.97,4170.533,4173.202,I know we did make policy changes in the past.,81,,
787,0.97,4173.202,4182.645,"And in fact, jump starts economic Resiience section of the spend plan does also support the creation of additional small businesses for places like that.",81,,
788,0.97,4182.645,4187.016,"And plus, the work that we did with M.H.A.",81,,
789,0.97,4187.016,4191.72,"To create smaller business fronts as well, with some of the housing funding that we're receiving there.",81,,
790,0.97,4191.72,4195.991,We wanted to encourage smaller store frontage.,81,,
791,0.97,4195.991,4202.665,I'm thinking of a series of programs and policies that braided together can help fill out that vision.,81,,
792,0.97,4202.665,4205.267,"But director, do you have anything else to add to that?",81,,
793,0.97,4205.267,4228.123,"What I was going to say, counsel, in response to Council member Nelson's response is that this is about strengthening Community-Based organizations, to be able to make the decisions that are best for them and their communities which often involve small business spaces.",82,,
794,0.97,4228.123,4229.992,The funding of the small businesses.,82,,
795,0.97,4229.992,4235.13,I feel like there's an intent being worked on now that talks about better coordinating.,82,,
796,0.97,4235.13,4244.239,"How we, as an office, work with other departments, like Opcd, who have the equitable development initiative.",82,,
797,0.97,4244.239,4244.607,And office.,82,,
798,0.97,4244.607,4245.874,Economic development.,82,,
799,0.97,4245.874,4248.277,How do we think about doing that?,82,,
800,0.97,4248.277,4260.99,"Because even when the Community- based organization has the capacity to be able to undertake this project, I think I can say this we as a city don't necessarily make it easy for them in that we may want child care.",82,,
801,0.97,4260.99,4264.226,"Well, you need to go speak to this other Department that does this.",82,,
802,0.97,4264.226,4268.697,So how do we allow the Community-Based organization to be in the best situation?,82,,
803,0.97,4268.697,4274.036,"And how can we, the city, be the best partner with them in doing this work?",82,,
804,0.97,4274.036,4278.674,So the funding piece gets figured out on the small business side better.,82,,
805,0.97,4278.674,4289.051,But I would say the Filipino community of Seattle is probably more looking to the small businesses in their community.,82,,
806,0.97,4289.051,4294.757,And how do we find spaces for them than Maybe some other developers.,82,,
807,0.97,4294.757,4297.092,Because of the fact that they're all in community together.,82,,
808,0.97,4297.092,4301.13,Not to put words and expectations on the communities.,82,,
809,0.97,4301.13,4302.798,On the Filipino community of Seattle.,82,,
810,0.97,4302.798,4304.5,But using them as an example.,82,,
811,0.97,4304.5,4305.567,Excellent.,83,,
812,0.97,4305.567,4309.872,"And I will also say, though, Councilmember Nelson.",83,,
813,0.97,4309.872,4313.142,You raise an important point about the ultimate vision.,83,,
814,0.97,4313.142,4316.311,And when we used these funds for land acquisition.,83,,
815,0.97,4316.311,4328.357,"And then the community organization gets the chance to actually grab that land, then they, as director Mcgempin said, if they are through the small businesses.",83,,
816,0.97,4328.357,4329.124,Then it is possible.,83,,
817,0.97,4329.124,4329.391,Right?,83,,
818,0.97,4329.391,4332.761,So while the funding braiding still needs to happen.,83,,
819,0.97,4332.761,4333.896,You're absolutely right.,83,,
820,0.97,4333.896,4338.567,Acquiring that property makes it also possible for the smaller businesses to also move in.,83,,
821,0.97,4338.567,4338.901,Right.,84,,
822,0.97,4338.901,4341.203,The fund suggest freed up for ground floor.,84,,
823,0.97,4341.203,4341.637,Yes.,85,,
824,0.97,4341.637,4341.87,Exactly.,85,,
825,0.97,4341.87,4343.238,And thanks for highlighting the slide.,85,,
826,0.97,4343.238,4346.241,I think that was our slide out of our office in 2019.,85,,
827,0.97,4346.241,4348.477,We know it was delayed by Covid.,85,,
828,0.97,4348.477,4351.38,But we're excited about that.,85,,
829,0.97,4351.38,4357.353,"Tracy, anything else to add before I go to Councilmember Pedersen?",85,,
830,0.97,4357.353,4359.288,Just to be correct.,86,,
831,0.97,4359.288,4364.226,We are getting one by the end of June that tries to address the question.,86,,
832,0.97,4364.226,4364.593,Actually soon.,86,,
833,0.97,4364.593,4372.768,"But actually, end of October, that gets at this question about coordination of the various parties and their fund sources.",86,,
834,0.97,4372.768,4373.102,Exciting.,87,,
835,0.97,4373.102,4373.402,"Okay, great.",87,,
836,0.97,4373.535,4377.94,Thanks for the question.,87,,
837,0.97,4377.94,4378.44,Councilmember Pedersen.,87,,
838,0.97,4378.44,4380.709,Go ahead.,87,,
839,0.97,4380.709,4385.08,Thank you.,88,,
840,0.97,4385.08,4387.916,I definitely support funding low-income house.,88,,
841,0.97,4387.916,4392.755,And this is the West way to do it by empowering our local organizations.,88,,
842,0.97,4392.755,4397.826,I want to acknowledge the work that these have already done for Seattle and continue to do.,88,,
843,0.97,4397.826,4402.264,I do have a couple of questions about the numbers.,88,,
844,0.97,4402.264,4408.57,I think this question might be for Tracy by central staff.,88,,
845,0.97,4408.57,4414.109,So the--how much money are we talking about?,88,,
846,0.97,4414.109,4414.71,Big picture.,88,,
847,0.97,4414.71,4418.914,It says 13% of available funds for certain housing activities.,88,,
848,0.97,4419.047,4429.858,"But--so could we, I don't know if there's a dollar amount there or could we look at the 2022 Jump-Start spend plan and estimate what that is.",88,,
849,0.97,4429.858,4431.66,Yes.,89,,
850,0.97,4431.66,4432.761,It's about $15.7 million in 2022.,89,,
851,0.97,4432.895,4443.639,"That would be available for this program and then, you know, I think it's actually about 16% of the housing dollars that are available going forward.",89,,
852,0.97,4443.639,4448.21,"And obviously that amount, the $15 million could change, depending on the amount of proceeds that come in.",89,,
853,0.97,4448.21,4455.517,"But this year, we know it's about $15.7 million.",89,,
854,0.97,4455.517,4456.185,Thank you.,90,,
855,0.97,4456.185,4458.554,And in terms of preventing displacement.,90,,
856,0.97,4458.554,4472.935,"Is that something that will be defined, for example, as with, is it acquiring housing with regulatory agreements that are expiring or Project-Based section 8 half contracts that are expiring?",90,,
857,0.97,4472.935,4476.338,Or if it's just in a certain zip code.,90,,
858,0.97,4476.338,4479.141,It's just assumed to help prevent displacement.,90,,
859,0.97,4479.141,4485.681,"So I think, looking at the policies and director chin might be able to answer this better.",91,,
860,0.97,4485.814,4493.789,I think there is a priority given to the acquisition of occupied buildings.,91,,
861,0.97,4493.789,4499.995,That's one thing that might give a nod to or Prioritize the existing buildings.,91,,
862,0.97,4499.995,4510.405,"I don't know if, Kelli, you have further criteria, that might support the idea of trying to preserve those existing affordable [inaudible",91,,
863,0.97,4510.405,4514.443,"And if I might, as well, add to the Councilmember's question.",92,,
864,0.97,4514.443,4519.114,I think it's also a question of belly buttons served.,92,,
865,0.97,4519.114,4519.748,Belly buttons housed.,92,,
866,0.97,4519.748,4521.116,So if you think of individuals.,92,,
867,0.97,4521.116,4523.185,That's what we talk about in Healthcare.,92,,
868,0.97,4523.185,4526.121,How many people are we talking about?,92,,
869,0.97,4526.121,4532.761,"And so if it's--if you have a response to the question as Tracy branded, preservation of units.",92,,
870,0.97,4532.761,4542.938,"But also the folks who are experiencing displacement, I think is something that we worked on a lot through the Communitypreference and affirmative market policies.",92,,
871,0.97,4542.938,4550.546,"And if you look at the folks who are, for example, in the Filipino center, Filipino village.",92,,
872,0.97,4550.546,4556.218,The eligible folks who came in are the communities at high risk of displacement from those communities.,92,,
873,0.97,4556.218,4561.056,"Just wanted to sort of broaden the questions out a little bit, to think about the individuals.",92,,
874,0.97,4561.056,4565.16,The belly buttons that are going to be housed there.,92,,
875,0.97,4565.16,4574.069,And think about displacement of those individuals to the existing individuals.,92,,
876,0.97,4574.069,4576.471,Does that make sense?,92,,
877,0.97,4576.471,4577.306,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",93,,
878,0.97,4577.306,4582.344,I was just trying to figure out if office of housing was going to use criteria.,93,,
879,0.97,4582.344,4589.685,"I know a major concern is for these housing projects, where all of them are extremely low income.",93,,
880,0.97,4589.685,4591.453,All the residents there.,93,,
881,0.97,4591.453,4597.159,But there's the regulatory agreement is expiring.,93,,
882,0.97,4597.159,4597.726,Or contracted.,93,,
883,0.97,4597.726,4600.696,The owners choosing not to renew that contract.,93,,
884,0.97,4600.696,4603.865,And then you've got 100% of the residents at risk.,93,,
885,0.97,4603.865,4606.601,I just didn't know if O.H.,93,,
886,0.97,4606.601,4609.504,Was considering that as criteria.,93,,
887,0.97,4609.504,4618.08,Any comments and response to that from the team of office housing?,94,,
888,0.97,4618.08,4620.015,Kelli Larsen with the office of housing.,95,,
889,0.97,4620.015,4624.786,I think we do look broadly at the definition of displacement.,95,,
890,0.97,4624.786,4629.658,We often are referring to the O.P.D.,95,,
891,0.97,4629.658,4629.858,Work.,95,,
892,0.97,4629.858,4634.796,And we overlay our very Fastments with the work that Opcd is doing.,95,,
893,0.97,4634.796,4636.732,We're constantly staying in touch with them on that.,95,,
894,0.97,4636.732,4642.037,And working to decide and analyze investments and what they mean in terms of preventing displacement.,95,,
895,0.97,4642.037,4662.858,But I would say for sure that we would be categorizing programs and housing such as Councilmember Pedersen described as an Anti- displacement investment.,95,,
896,0.97,4662.858,4671.633,I am assuming there are a list of projects throughout the city that have contracts and have low-income housing for regulatory agreements.,96,,
897,0.97,4671.633,4674.302,And no one knows they're expiring.,96,,
898,0.97,4674.302,4680.509,So you can even point these organizations to those acquisition opportunities.,96,,
899,0.97,4680.509,4688.316,So that they don't convert to market rate housing ask the rents shoot up quickly and displace people.,96,,
900,0.97,4688.316,4696.758,Does office of housing have a list of projects that are at risk of converting from Low- income housing to market rate?,96,,
901,0.97,4696.758,4699.428,"Kelli, I'll answer that.",97,,
902,0.97,4699.428,4704.733,"Traditionally, we have kept a list of both projects coming up.",97,,
903,0.97,4704.733,4708.07,And the section 8 contracts.,97,,
904,0.97,4708.07,4710.639,"Sometimes, projects coming up are worth a lot of money.",97,,
905,0.97,4710.639,4715.143,"But they also have continued regulatory agreements, right?",97,,
906,0.97,4715.143,4716.945,For continued use agreements for I think 40 years on that.,97,,
907,0.97,4717.079,4743.271,"I would say oftentimes, if I'm using my old hat, as somebody who was working in this space before, I would always try to keep my section 8. but I'm always looking at those other new development opportunities that would allow me to more fully embrace the community development lens that I would wear.",97,,
908,0.97,4743.271,4743.472,Right?,97,,
909,0.97,4743.472,4748.009,So I never would want to lose section 8 in my neighborhood.,97,,
910,0.97,4748.009,4749.678,"Because it's really, really hard to get back.",97,,
911,0.97,4749.678,4755.35,"And at the office of housing, we have in our asset management team.",97,,
912,0.97,4755.35,4765.927,"But we haven't had that many opportunities to go after and go Toskipta and say, Ed would you be interested in buying this property?",97,,
913,0.97,4765.927,4768.63,That's what we need to enter with our other organizations.,97,,
914,0.97,4768.63,4773.468,And to look for these acquisition out.,98,,
915,0.97,4773.468,4781.076,"I can't resist putting a plug for the legislation that the council passed, to identify naturally occurring affordable housing.",98,,
916,0.97,4781.076,4783.078,Those would be good opportunities to acquire.,98,,
917,0.97,4783.078,4787.616,Had a question about the developer fee.,98,,
918,0.97,4787.616,4797.192,"Want to make sure we're, you know, acquiring as many units as possible with the resources that we have.",98,,
919,0.97,4797.192,4806.735,"And I understood, I thought the housing levy program, there's a developer fee schedule on the office of housing Website.",98,,
920,0.97,4806.735,4818.213,"For example, it limits developer fees to 2.5% of total development costs for projects costing over $12 million.",98,,
921,0.97,4818.213,4825.587,"So is this, the proposal to provide an additional $500,000 for those developer fees.",99,,
922,0.97,4825.587,4831.76,Is that--do we need to change that policy for the developer fee schedule?,99,,
923,0.97,4831.76,4834.696,Or is this coming from a different authorization?,99,,
924,0.97,4834.696,4840.101,This would come from a different authorization?,99,,
925,0.97,4840.101,4842.971,I guess that's for central staff or O.H.,99,,
926,0.97,4842.971,4843.638,Yes.,100,,
927,0.97,4843.638,4849.11,This is unique to this specific program for Jumpstart O.H.P.,100,,
928,0.97,4849.11,4851.012,It's a very narrow scope for this stage.,100,,
929,0.97,4851.012,4856.451,And we are testing and can see how it will change over time.,100,,
930,0.97,4856.451,4865.327,"But for now, it's how they would compete that would be eligible for up to $500,000 of additional developer fee.",100,,
931,0.97,4865.327,4869.097,Which would be project definition and negotiation phase.,100,,
932,0.97,4869.097,4869.764,One last.,101,,
933,0.97,4869.764,4874.069,So that won't apply to every single investment at the office of housing.,102,,
934,0.97,4874.069,4876.638,Only these specific projects will be eligible.,102,,
935,0.97,4876.638,4887.916,"And also, the housing funding policies, Councilmember, don't include that developer fee cap that might be how O.H.",103,,
936,0.97,4887.916,4889.05,Implements their loan program.,103,,
937,0.97,4889.05,4897.959,"But it's not actually something in the housing funding policies that would require a change, just F.Y.I.",103,,
938,0.97,4897.959,4907.402,"So in this case, for this program, would there be--it's labeled as an acquisition and preservation program.",104,,
939,0.97,4907.402,4910.138,And then there's the developer fee.,104,,
940,0.97,4910.138,4913.742,So is there actual development occurring?,104,,
941,0.97,4913.742,4923.051,"Are all the units acquired, are they required to be renovated so that there's development, real estate development activity occurring for the fee?",104,,
942,0.97,4923.051,4936.064,Or is the fee just a payment that goes to the organization while they're just acquiring a building?,104,,
943,0.97,4936.064,4942.103,I guess I'm just thinking of developer fee as a term in the real estate Finance world.,105,,
944,0.97,4942.103,4948.176,"It's for building or renovating, typically.",105,,
945,0.97,4948.176,4951.179,"Kelli, do you want me--I'll go first.",106,,
946,0.97,4951.179,4951.646,I see Kelli nodding.,106,,
947,0.97,4951.646,4959.621,If we think about this in a linear.,106,,
948,0.97,4959.621,4962.123,They receive the capacity building grant.,106,,
949,0.97,4962.123,4966.361,And used that money to help build capacity.,106,,
950,0.97,4966.361,4968.129,"That could be education, training, board development.",106,,
951,0.97,4968.129,4968.596,All of that.,106,,
952,0.97,4968.596,4971.299,When you acquire.,106,,
953,0.97,4971.299,4976.871,You might be acquiring land and you might be acquiring a project.,106,,
954,0.97,4976.871,4981.643,But you have five years to use this time.,106,,
955,0.97,4981.643,4986.748,"We want a development plan for whatever it is, that is being bought in five years.",107,,
956,0.97,4986.748,4989.017,So if you are acquiring land.,107,,
957,0.97,4989.017,4993.822,You have to incur your own expenses during that five-year plan.,107,,
958,0.97,4993.822,5000.195,Because you're going to have to hire the right set of development team members to do the work.,107,,
959,0.97,5000.195,5001.129,Whether it's architect.,107,,
960,0.97,5001.129,5001.396,Engineer.,107,,
961,0.97,5001.396,5006.835,You about you as an organization need to do those funds in order to do the work during that five-year plan.,107,,
962,0.97,5006.835,5009.471,If you are buying a building and preserving it.,107,,
963,0.97,5009.471,5019.014,"I would say very rarely do you actually have a building that is pristine and great and lovely, that you're going to have to go not do anything with.",107,,
964,0.97,5019.014,5021.85,You are also going to have to have a five-year plan.,107,,
965,0.97,5021.85,5028.156,"And that five years to do the work necessary, in order to acquire and purchase that as well.",107,,
966,0.97,5028.156,5035.897,"Kelli, if I'm incorrect in that, please correct me.",107,,
967,0.97,5035.897,5041.903,"So Kelli is nodding, for folks who can't see the full screen.",108,,
968,0.97,5041.903,5042.47,Okay.,108,,
969,0.97,5042.47,5044.172,"Excellent, Councilmember Pedersen.",108,,
970,0.97,5044.172,5047.308,"And I think initially, some of these underscore the issues we're trying to address here.",108,,
971,0.97,5047.308,5059.754,We want to make it possible for these organizations to really acquire the land to initiate the projects and not being held up and trying to figure out how to Braid the funding sources with the front end.,108,,
972,0.97,5059.754,5074.369,"And how quickly those properties disappear off the market is very problematic for making sure that we can either do preservation, building the buildings or as Councilmembers might say, building on top of historic houses.",108,,
973,0.97,5074.369,5084.879,So I'm excited about the quickness in which this will hopefully bring opportunities into the folks who are looking to develop new housing and help prevent displacement.,108,,
974,0.97,5084.879,5088.082,"Councilmember Herbold, thanks for your patience to wrap us up.",108,,
975,0.97,5088.082,5088.616,Sure.,109,,
976,0.97,5088.616,5090.385,Really appreciate that conversation.,109,,
977,0.97,5090.385,5094.489,Was hoping it would answer my question because it was in the ballpark there.,109,,
978,0.97,5094.489,5097.158,But not quite.,109,,
979,0.97,5097.158,5115.176,"I do, I want to be specific about the kind of displacement I'm asking about, rather than Defaulting to sort of the broader definition of displacement that is designed to ensure that people in an area can either stay or return.",109,,
980,0.97,5115.176,5123.751,I want to really focus on those buildings that Councilmember Pedersen was talking about.,109,,
981,0.97,5123.751,5139.667,I have community groups in my district who are really interested in acquiring buildings that are at risk of being purchased in the speculative market.,109,,
982,0.97,5139.667,5146.007,And are interested in resources to help them do so.,109,,
983,0.97,5146.007,5150.278,"They're not established, nonprofit housing developers.",109,,
984,0.97,5150.278,5157.519,But they're--they have been working for several years to realize this vision for South park.,109,,
985,0.97,5157.519,5174.702,And so what is still not clear to me is whether or not this program is expected to help organizations like this build housing.,109,,
986,0.97,5174.702,5181.442,"Or if it's instead, focused on acquisition of land, as well as, of course, the capacity building piece.",109,,
987,0.97,5181.442,5182.544,Or is it both?,109,,
988,0.97,5182.544,5187.782,"Do we just happen to be talking about, mostly about land today?",109,,
989,0.97,5187.782,5194.122,In the projects that we talked about in the panel?,109,,
990,0.97,5194.122,5212.74,Or is this fund flexible enough to allow for these Community- based organizations to purchase specific buildings in the geographic area that is identified as being at high risk of displacement.,109,,
991,0.97,5212.74,5217.345,"And if so, just wanting to understand.",109,,
992,0.97,5217.345,5225.853,Is the program designed to help these organizations to move quickly to seize the opportunities they see?,109,,
993,0.97,5225.853,5231.693,"Insofar as like, is this going to be like a rolling application process?",109,,
994,0.97,5231.693,5240.368,How will these organizations be best poised to take advantage of this new opportunity?,109,,
995,0.97,5240.368,5240.635,Thank you.,109,,
996,0.97,5240.635,5246.774,Anybody like to take that from simple stack or office of housing?,110,,
997,0.97,5246.774,5248.776,Please go ahead.,110,,
998,0.97,5248.776,5253.881,"I would say, Councilmember Herbold, you asked the question of how flexible?",111,,
999,0.97,5253.881,5255.683,It's pretty flexible at this point.,111,,
1000,0.97,5255.683,5255.883,Right?,111,,
1001,0.97,5255.883,5261.089,"Because we are just kind of here laying out a framework, from what we've heard.",111,,
1002,0.97,5261.089,5267.629,And I think you should expect changes if the program over time as that gets implemented and developed.,111,,
1003,0.97,5267.629,5270.565,So this is just setting the framework for it.,111,,
1004,0.97,5270.565,5272.3,So is it flexible is this yes.,111,,
1005,0.97,5272.3,5282.343,"And in the case of community organizations, I think, that are looking at Seizing opportunities to buy buildings.",111,,
1006,0.97,5282.343,5286.581,"They need some capacity building, in some sense to help develop what it is that they want to do.",111,,
1007,0.97,5286.581,5289.617,So as I said earlier.,111,,
1008,0.97,5289.617,5292.287,"I think I mentioned the term, Intentionality.",111,,
1009,0.97,5292.287,5298.092,"And it's a path to having a conversation with themselves, as to what is the best shape and form in which to do that.",111,,
1010,0.97,5298.092,5300.495,"Which I think is really, really important.",111,,
1011,0.97,5300.495,5306.801,"Because when you end up working with the office of housing, we expect you to work with us for 85 years.",111,,
1012,0.97,5306.801,5308.636,And being around for that long.,111,,
1013,0.97,5308.636,5312.306,I hate to say it.,111,,
1014,0.97,5312.306,5317.779,So Councilmember Mosqueda had these nice words of the community self-preservation Fund.,111,,
1015,0.97,5317.779,5318.846,I made the internal joke.,111,,
1016,0.97,5318.846,5322.25,It's like the bad marriage Fund.,111,,
1017,0.97,5322.25,5325.086,Because you are forming this working relationship.,111,,
1018,0.97,5325.086,5328.089,And it has to be with Intentionality.,111,,
1019,0.97,5328.089,5329.357,The acquiring of projects quickly.,111,,
1020,0.97,5329.357,5336.698,So you have to go slow bench observe you can go fast is what a mentor told me.,111,,
1021,0.97,5336.698,5342.003,Because you have ton what you're doing.,111,,
1022,0.97,5342.003,5343.538,If opportunities pop up.,111,,
1023,0.97,5343.538,5346.341,We are okay with acquiring those.,111,,
1024,0.97,5346.341,5351.179,"At this point, where we haven't gotten the program set up quite and we're not quite there.",111,,
1025,0.97,5351.179,5353.214,We need to seize those opportunities.,111,,
1026,0.97,5353.214,5357.118,I think you asked the question of whether it's rolling funds.,111,,
1027,0.97,5357.118,5370.765,"The loan program, we envision being a rolling Fund, as much as our current acquisition fund is but I think that the capacity building will probably be through a notification of funding availability that is issued later on.",111,,
1028,0.97,5370.765,5370.965,Okay.,111,,
1029,0.97,5370.965,5376.971,"Who wants to access these funds and be willing to do it, with this pot of money at this time?",111,,
1030,0.97,5377.105,5383.644,But real estate doesn't fall on this nice schedule of waiting around for the city to issue our Nofas.,111,,
1031,0.97,5383.644,5384.746,So the a & amp; P.,111,,
1032,0.97,5384.746,5387.715,The acquisition funds will have to be rolling.,111,,
1033,0.97,5387.715,5389.117,That's our current envisioning of it.,111,,
1034,0.97,5389.117,5389.851,Okay.,112,,
1035,0.97,5389.851,5394.255,So just to restate what I thought you heard you say.,112,,
1036,0.97,5394.255,5400.161,"Or what I thought--what I thought you meant, when I heard you say, that yes, the fund is flexible.",112,,
1037,0.97,5400.161,5409.704,You are saying it is flexible to accommodate both acquisition of property as well as acquisition of buildings.,112,,
1038,0.97,5409.704,5411.706,"We are acquiring, period.",113,,
1039,0.97,5411.706,5412.473,Just aquiring.,113,,
1040,0.97,5412.607,5412.774,Yeah.,113,,
1041,0.97,5412.774,5415.643,Yes.,114,,
1042,0.97,5415.643,5416.077,Yes.,115,,
1043,0.97,5416.077,5417.945,I think you say yes.,116,,
1044,0.97,5417.945,5418.646,Yes.,117,,
1045,0.97,5418.646,5418.813,Yes.,117,,
1046,0.97,5418.813,5420.114,Thank you.,118,,
1047,0.97,5420.114,5423.05,Because it's acquisition and preservation.,119,,
1048,0.97,5423.05,5423.317,Yeah.,120,,
1049,0.97,5423.317,5432.36,"I appreciate your question, Councilmember Herbold, and to also do a trailer to Councilmember Pedersen's question as well.",121,,
1050,0.97,5432.36,5439.2,"I think we, too, are interested in the building concept as well, because there are belly buttons and families in those units.",121,,
1051,0.97,5439.2,5447.308,And one of the community partners that was part of the community round table was the affordable housing coalition.,121,,
1052,0.97,5447.308,5449.377,I know you've spent a lot of time working with them.,121,,
1053,0.97,5449.377,5457.685,"They also came off of mute and Velma, and anybody on the line that day, I know Miguel, you came off of mute that day.",121,,
1054,0.97,5457.685,5462.757,"Folks from Africatown came off of mute to say, we need this Fund, to make sure we have greater flexibility.",121,,
1055,0.97,5462.757,5474.435,And we need to remove these greater requirements for you to have X number of years or X number of experience or buildings so I think that they very much are interested in this concept as well.,121,,
1056,0.97,5474.435,5478.139,"But I will, again, underscore what I think we've all been lifting up here.",121,,
1057,0.97,5478.139,5480.374,That this is one Avenue of funding.,121,,
1058,0.97,5480.374,5483.01,So we need to make sure to keep lifting this up.,121,,
1059,0.97,5483.01,5486.614,When we think about the levy renewal policies.,121,,
1060,0.97,5486.614,5496.624,"When we think about the notice of intent to sell changes, so that there is a pot of funding for multifamily structures that come on the market.",121,,
1061,0.97,5496.624,5501.462,I think we'll continue to infuse this concept that you have all brought up to date.,121,,
1062,0.97,5501.462,5503.531,And all of these funding sources.,121,,
1063,0.97,5503.531,5506.067,So that we continue to have more funding overall.,121,,
1064,0.97,5506.067,5511.272,Because it can't just be done through this fund alone.,121,,
1065,0.97,5511.272,5516.844,"And community colleagues, is there anything else that you'd like to add to any of the questions today.",121,,
1066,0.97,5516.844,5521.449,Or the issues that have been raised before we close this out?,121,,
1067,0.97,5521.449,5521.916,Please go ahead.,122,,
1068,0.97,5521.916,5529.156,"This is Velma, from the Filipino community.",123,,
1069,0.97,5529.156,5535.363,"I just wanted to add, the whole issue of capacity building is really going to help us.",123,,
1070,0.97,5535.363,5559.02,"Because it's going to determine the discussion was, it's going to determine whether, like you said, whether we will have the capacity to build the child care center or--Or-And the small business units that will be on the first floor.",123,,
1071,0.97,5559.02,5562.456,So those are the things that we are also looking at.,123,,
1072,0.97,5562.456,5573.267,"And I wanted to just let you know that this capacity building Fund and the whole package, you know, will really be helpful to all of us.",123,,
1073,0.97,5573.267,5574.068,Excellent.,124,,
1074,0.97,5574.068,5576.637,Thank you for that.,124,,
1075,0.97,5576.637,5577.138,Any additional comments?,124,,
1076,0.97,5577.271,5583.911,"Okay, colleagues, I really appreciate all of the participation in this topic here today.",124,,
1077,0.97,5583.911,5587.248,"And again, thanks to the office of housing for your work.",124,,
1078,0.97,5587.248,5591.652,And thinking through the policy changes with us.,124,,
1079,0.97,5591.652,5594.956,Along with community and House and Tracy's staff.,124,,
1080,0.97,5594.956,5600.394,Just to highlight the four I think are the things this essential legislation would do.,124,,
1081,0.97,5600.394,5613.441,"It provides specific eligibility criteria, tailored to these small that are fighting displacement, have historically been excluded for policy and funding and providing them an Avenue.",124,,
1082,0.97,5613.441,5621.682,"It provides a permanent funding source, as opposed to a revolving fund that has to be paid back fairly quickly.",124,,
1083,0.97,5621.682,5622.45,And provides longer term.,124,,
1084,0.97,5622.45,5627.888,Work over five years to make sure there is truly a partnership with O.H.,124,,
1085,0.97,5627.888,5641.569,"The permanent need allows for more flexible time lines so that organizations can secure the land and work on developing it through that community vision, without having to partner, necessarily with an outside organization that is not part of their vision.",124,,
1086,0.97,5641.569,5645.139,And I know we have great appearance.,124,,
1087,0.97,5645.139,5650.077,El Centro and Filipino community center and Skipta and Africatown.,124,,
1088,0.97,5650.077,5654.348,And there are many who have jointly been at the ribbon cutting celebrating.,124,,
1089,0.97,5654.348,5656.951,But having more determination is always something that is good.,124,,
1090,0.97,5656.951,5664.558,And something that we should work to ensure our public policies promote.,124,,
1091,0.97,5664.558,5668.362,And working to this building technical assistance.,124,,
1092,0.97,5668.362,5669.196,Acquiring skills.,124,,
1093,0.97,5669.196,5689.283,"Helping the affordable housing element of the nonprofit organization become more core to what they do to create that skill set among community organizations is a really good thing, especially as more community organizations are seeking to provide housing to their community that they either provide meals to right now.",124,,
1094,0.97,5689.283,5690.551,"Child care, educational programs.",124,,
1095,0.97,5690.551,5690.818,Et cetera.,124,,
1096,0.97,5690.951,5695.289,They want to also be in the place where they can offer housing.,124,,
1097,0.97,5695.289,5699.593,"This is really exciting, that so much advocacy has gone into elevating this issue.",124,,
1098,0.97,5699.593,5709.17,And now we have leaders within the office of housing that can help us realize this decision and elected who I am hopeful are supportive of this.,124,,
1099,0.97,5709.17,5712.173,So thanks again for all of your work today and highlighting that.,124,,
1100,0.97,5712.173,5713.874,We spent quite a bit of time on this.,124,,
1101,0.97,5713.874,5721.482,"But wanted to make sure we got into these details and look forward to, if there's no objection.",124,,
1102,0.97,5721.482,5726.287,Look forward to having the potential vote on this today.,124,,
1103,0.97,5726.287,5731.725,"Colleagues, I move the committee recommend passage of item 120343.",124,,

1112,0.97,5755.416,5758.419,I know you have been with it for almost a year.,127,,
1113,0.97,5758.419,5767.661,"But this is the first time that I have been seeing this Fortunately, my staff and I were able to jump on this and ask questions.",127,,
1114,0.97,5767.661,5769.764,And thank you for the answers we received today.,127,,
1115,0.97,5769.764,5776.203,I think there's still some stuff that sounds like it needs to be worked out.,127,,
1116,0.97,5776.203,5780.241,But with it being $50 million is a doable amount.,127,,
1117,0.97,5780.241,5781.509,And appreciate you stating a vision.,127,,
1118,0.97,5781.509,5784.345,So I want to be supportive.,127,,

1209,0.97,6142.603,6150.41,We have been using this yard space roughly since 2017.,150,,
1210,0.97,6150.41,6154.748,At the time this property kind of became available.,150,,
1211,0.97,6154.748,6157.384,We were actively working with F.A.S.,150,,
1212,0.97,6157.384,6169.763,"To locate a yard space because we had been recently told by our sound transit partners at F.A.S., that we would need to vacate a space that we had been leasing for several years.",150,,
1213,0.97,6169.763,6172.299,So we were already kind of looking for a space.,150,,
1214,0.97,6172.299,6180.14,And desperately trying to find a space that was Logistically located close to the downtown core.,150,,
1215,0.97,6180.14,6183.81,And close to our largest facility which is Charles street.,150,,
1216,0.97,6183.81,6189.917,"So it actually really worked out, better than we thought at the time.",150,,
1217,0.97,6189.917,6196.623,And so that's second bullet.,150,,
1218,0.97,6196.623,6200.527,Wsdot and Sdot were talking about a way to actively use the space.,150,,
1219,0.97,6200.527,6206.266,And they said does Sdot have a project for this space.,150,,
1220,0.97,6206.266,6211.471,And the challenge is it is a long enough space to move large equipment.,150,,
1221,0.97,6211.471,6227.621,"This had those dimensions that we needed, even though we needed to, you know, put up a fence and make the space somewhat more secure, realizing that we would have valuable equipment and some officials stored there.",150,,
1222,0.97,6227.621,6233.76,"And so Yeah, this slide just REITERATES the use of the yard space.",150,,
1223,0.97,6233.76,6239.366,It also houses our snow and ice fighting equipment.,150,,
1224,0.97,6239.366,6243.971,And a lot of Signage and overflow Signage.,150,,
1225,0.97,6243.971,6247.874,"That our operations paving crew, asphalt and concrete also utilize.",150,,
1226,0.97,6247.874,6252.479,This is just kind of like an aerial of the space.,151,,
1227,0.97,6252.479,6254.948,"The actual space is in blue, designated in blue.",151,,
1228,0.97,6254.948,6256.75,It's kind of like that Triangle.,151,,
1229,0.97,6256.883,6263.857,"And we have, it's Fully-Fenced now.",151,,
1230,0.97,6263.857,6268.595,And we did do some minor development.,151,,
1231,0.97,6268.595,6270.564,"Mainly, we added some Aggreat.",151,,
1232,0.97,6270.564,6271.498,Crushed rock and compacted it.,151,,
1233,0.97,6271.498,6276.169,And we wanted to make sure that anything we added was Pervious.,151,,
1234,0.97,6276.169,6278.472,So we didn't trigger any drainage needs.,151,,
1235,0.97,6278.472,6283.51,"And also, just makes the yard a lot more usable during the winter rainy months.",151,,
1236,0.97,6283.51,6285.979,We don't have equipment and people getting stuck.,151,,
1237,0.97,6285.979,6288.849,Because it does get pretty saturated in that area.,151,,
1238,0.97,6288.849,6301.928,"And then over to the right and designated in red, that's our current space that not only Sdot but also F.A.S.",151,,
1239,0.97,6301.928,6302.195,And Yeah.,151,,
1240,0.97,6302.195,6303.93,Mainly and N.S.P.U.,151,,
1241,0.97,6303.93,6309.569,Showed that yard space that we lease from.,151,,
1242,0.97,6309.569,6310.404,F.A.S.,151,,
1243,0.97,6310.404,6311.538,Or Wdot through F.A.S.,151,,
1244,0.97,6311.538,6316.777,"And now, I'm going it turn it over to Karen Gruen Wf.A.S.",151,,
1245,0.97,6316.777,6318.545,Real estate services to finish out the power point.,151,,
1246,0.97,6318.545,6322.482,"And if there is time, we'll both be available for questions.",151,,
1247,0.97,6322.482,6324.117,"Thank you, Gerard.",152,,
1248,0.97,6324.117,6326.386,"And good morning, chair Mosqueda.",152,,
1249,0.97,6326.386,6326.953,Good morning Councilmembers.,152,,
1250,0.97,6327.087,6328.889,Committee members.,152,,
1251,0.97,6328.889,6333.46,F.A.S .'s rule here is to act as the leasing agent for Sdot.,152,,
1252,0.97,6333.46,6343.337,"And the lease agreement just briefly is before the committee this morning, allows Sdot to use the space, as Gerard said, for operational purposes.",152,,
1253,0.97,6343.337,6348.709,The square foot is considerable.,152,,
1254,0.97,6348.709,6351.378,"It's a large space, 63,544 square feet.",152,,
1255,0.97,6351.378,6355.015,We've negotiated an initial term of the lease for six years.,152,,
1256,0.97,6355.015,6366.693,"That runs from April 1, 2017, when Sdot first started occupying the space to March 31st, 2023.",152,,
1257,0.97,6366.693,6372.966,And we've also negotiated two five-year Extendings.,152,,
1258,0.97,6372.966,6376.77,Those would be at Sdot's option.,152,,
1259,0.97,6376.77,6389.349,"The agreement calls for Washington State Department of transportation to waive rent from that initial date of April 1, 2017 through December 31st, 2020.",152,,
1260,0.97,6389.349,6396.256,"And the rental amount is roughly $4,000.",152,,
1261,0.97,6396.256,6401.561,And there's an option to Increaseannually by 2%.,152,,
1262,0.97,6401.561,6407.0,"On the next slide, you will see the terms depicted in a grid form.",152,,
1263,0.97,6407.0,6410.504,That shows the annual expense to Sdot for the lease.,152,,
1264,0.97,6410.504,6416.977,And then note that that waiver of rent from April 1ST through the entire year of 2020.,152,,
1265,0.97,6416.977,6424.117,That's in recognition for the city's investment in cleaning up the property when Sdot first started using it.,152,,
1266,0.97,6424.251,6429.823,"Next slide, we're here before the Council because the director of F.A.S.",152,,
1267,0.97,6429.823,6434.361,Has the signing authority for a lease Ofthis nature.,152,,
1268,0.97,6434.361,6440.066,"With this size of property, over 18,000 square feet of yard space.",152,,
1269,0.97,6440.066,6448.275,"And with this duration for the term of six years, we require Council authorization for the director to be able to sign this lease on behalf of Sdot.",152,,
1270,0.97,6448.275,6456.283,And we're happy to partner with Sdot on this and answer any questions that the committee has for us.,152,,
1271,0.97,6456.283,6456.583,Thank you.,152,,

1419,0.97,7244.237,7252.345,Part of my questions that I've been having over the last six to eight months that I'm passing is when other jurisdictional funding comes in.,187,,
1420,0.97,7252.345,7255.948,Either through the county from dollars.,187,,
1421,0.97,7255.948,7262.388,State from state legislative budget that was very much an investment in human services as well.,187,,
1422,0.97,7262.388,7270.129,Or from additional Federal dollars if those dollars can help offset some of the funding that we provided in our 2022 budget.,187,,
1423,0.97,7270.129,7270.63,That would be great.,187,,
1424,0.97,7270.63,7272.765,To say that there's going to be Les dollars.,187,,
1425,0.97,7272.765,7276.769,But if they're able to supplant existing general fund used.,187,,
1426,0.97,7276.769,7281.44,"That would be helpful to know, especially given the specific budget situation we're facing.",187,,
1427,0.97,7281.44,7289.882,And I know we're all interested in utilizing every dollar available that might be Nongeneral fund related.,187,,

1440,0.97,7319.578,7326.852,"In our budget from last year, we allocated about $5.1 for food assistance.",190,,
1441,0.97,7326.852,7331.59,Largely because the state Legislature hadn't had a chance to convene.,190,,
1442,0.97,7331.59,7331.857,They did.,190,,
1443,0.97,7331.991,7336.128,So as we think about where our city dollars are going.,190,,
1444,0.97,7336.128,7339.899,If there is opportunity to redirect some of those that would be good.,190,,
1445,0.97,7339.899,7353.245,But just want to ensure that we underscore that it has to be keeping the programs whole and helping to provide any lift of existing holds on any dollars.,190,,
