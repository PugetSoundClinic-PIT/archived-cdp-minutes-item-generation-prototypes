20,0.97,37.103,37.604,Thank you so much.,18,,
21,0.97,37.604,43.41,"If there is no objection, the minutes of July 13th, 2020, will be adopted.",18,,
22,0.97,43.41,47.08,"Hearing no objection, the minutes are adopted.",18,,
23,0.97,47.08,66.933,"President's report, just quickly this morning, there will be a memo actually, it already came out at 9:01 a.m., a memo to schedule additional meetings of the select budget committee.",18,,
24,0.97,66.933,72.238,Memo and meeting times it creates do not depart from the schedules Councilmember Mosqueda gave to you and previously discussed last week.,18,,
25,0.97,72.238,86.953,It simply lows them to be listed as regular rather than special meeting given the central stark additional time and flexibility to published materials for the benefit of us and the public as they work to meet our legislative and parliamentary deadlines.,18,,
26,0.97,86.953,94.727,I also want to mention that we are testing out a new approach to public comment this afternoon at the city council meeting.,18,,
27,0.97,94.727,119.352,"You may hear me say a lot of times during the introductory remarks that we're looking at new ways to improve the remote public comment period so this will be one of the things that we hope will help to improve and stream line remote public comment during full city Council, so on this afternoon's agenda, you may have noticed it lists two separate public comment periods.",18,,
28,0.97,119.352,131.698,The first comment period is for the public to address items that might appear on the introduction and referral calendar or on the Council's 2020 work program.,18,,
29,0.97,131.698,144.077,"Essentially, it is a public comment period that is designated for general comment for items that are not slated for final consideration on today's Council agenda.",18,,
30,0.97,144.077,151.017,The second public comment period will be exclusively for comments on items that are slated for final action on the agenda.,18,,
31,0.97,151.017,173.273,"This is the first time we're dividing the public comment period in this fashion at these meetings and the motivation, again, behind the two public comment option seas to carve out space for items on items up for final action while making room for comments about legislation and policies that are or may be discussed by the Council at future meetings.",18,,
32,0.97,173.273,190.757,"This could include, for example, comments regarding public safety, police reform, any other issues related to city business that, again, may not be directly tied with a specific piece of legislation that we are about to take final action on.",18,,
33,0.97,190.757,215.315,"My hope is that doing this division will allow people who are calling in on specific bills the opportunity to not wait, have to wait as long to give their public testimony about bills subject to final action while the general comment will sort of still fulfill the need for folks who are interested in giving us comments about general business of the city council.",18,,
34,0.97,215.315,223.59,Members of the public can still sign up for either public comment period during the usual registration period at 12:00 P.M.,18,,
35,0.97,223.59,232.398,Today and I'll discuss the modified protocols for public comment in more detail at the beginning of this afternoon's city council meeting.,18,,
36,0.97,232.398,245.578,"As usual, we are Piloting this approach and if it doesn't work quite as planned, we will continue to modify it or go back to the way that we were doing it before.",18,,
37,0.97,245.578,251.484,Appreciate your patient as we sort of test out this new way of doing remote public comment.,18,,
38,0.97,251.484,265.098,"Happy to hear any of your feed back in terms of how you think this afternoon goes after we pilot it and always happy to hear from members the public about the ease of use, et cetera.",18,,
39,0.97,265.098,271.804,"Happy to answer any questions about that President's report, otherwise, feel free to talk to me Offline.",18,,
40,0.97,271.804,274.574,Looks like there are no comments on that.,18,,
41,0.97,274.574,280.813,"We'll get into agenda item three which is a preview of today's city council action, Council and regional committees.",18,,
42,0.97,280.813,285.018,We'll go through the week's roll call rotation.,18,,
43,0.97,285.018,307.507,"This week that roll call rotation begins with Lewis and then Morales, Councilmember Mosqueda, Pedersen, Strauss, Herbold, and Juarez, and Councilmember Sawant did notify my office this morning that Unfortunately she will not be able to join us for Council briefing this morning but does intend to be at full council this afternoon at 2:00.",18,,
44,0.97,307.507,313.379,It will just be eight reports today.,18,,
45,0.97,313.379,316.382,"So without further Ado, let's get started.",18,,
46,0.97,316.382,317.784,First up is Councilmember Lewis.,18,,
47,0.97,317.784,321.454,"Thank you, Madam President, not a lot to report here at the beginning of the week.",19,,
48,0.97,321.454,331.798,There are no items on today Aoda introduction referral calendar or on this afternoon's agenda from the select Committee on homelessness strategies and investments.,19,,
49,0.97,331.798,348.514,I do have a piece of legislation that I personally am sponsoring the ordinance suspending personal guarantee clauses and commercial leases CB 119829.,19,,
50,0.97,348.514,378.745,"This is an important ordinance to provide certainty and get rid of a source of great stress for a lot of the small business owners across the city right now who are facing potential action against the personal guarantee holders on their leases and in some cases, being them themselves of possibly losing their homes or their savings for being in arrears on commercial rent.",19,,
51,0.97,378.745,412.979,"It is my personal position that I wish that the landlords would follow the example of a lot of their peers and seek payment plans or some alternate method of getting an arrangement rather than seeking to invoke the personal guarantees, but unfortunately there are some folks out there who are not doing that and so I think that this legislation models similar approach that's are happening in California and New York to get to the crux of the same problem and that will be on the agenda today.",19,,
52,0.97,412.979,415.014,There are two amendments.,19,,
53,0.97,415.014,438.738,"One of the amendments being provided by me, myself, which is certainly a friendly amendment to provide the relief permanently for business owners and Non-Profits who have subsequently dissolved or gone out of business during Covid so in their cases it wouldn't be a temporary suspension of the clause since they have gone out of business.",19,,
54,0.97,438.738,446.312,It would permanently prevent using that personal guarantee clause in the lease.,19,,
55,0.97,446.312,478.978,"The second amendment today is from Council member Herbold, a friendly amendment, extending the effect of the ban six months after the expiration of the Mayor's emergency order, similar to the other emergency legislation we have passed where there is also a buffer period between the end of the emergency order and the expiration of the legislation, so just wanted to flag those, looking forward to discussing that this afternoon.",19,,
56,0.97,478.978,509.008,"Additionally, last week, I had the privilege of attending the King County regional homelessness authority with Council President Gonzalez where we dove into the heavy and important work, Arguably the most important work of the committee of the body which is the scrutiny and approval of members of the implementation board.",19,,
57,0.97,509.008,518.618,Councilmember Gonzalez and I duly voted to confirm the implementation board so it is going forward.,19,,
58,0.97,518.618,568.401,"It was great to hear from everybody, from our colleagues, from the Eastside from our colleagues from King County, on the folks, not exclusively without issue but mostly without issue that folks had put forward to serve on the implementation board to be inspired by the Bios, the backgrounds and really seeing that on the whole, we are going to be in the position to have a truly exceptional board of people to implement the Co-Assembling of the human services Department of King County and Seattle and hopefully build on the foundation to make lasting and large scale regional progress on the crisis of homelessness.",19,,
59,0.97,568.401,580.413,I think we tend to forget being under four States of emergency that our original state of emergency this year was our massive crisis of so many of the neighbors living unsheltered.,19,,
60,0.97,580.413,587.386,We took a big step last week in improving the implementation board.,19,,
61,0.97,587.386,590.156,The next step is appointing a Ceo.,19,,
62,0.97,590.156,599.799,We look forward to that work and it is good to see that the regional effort is moving along.,19,,
63,0.97,599.799,602.802,Albeit slower due to Covid but it is moving along.,19,,
64,0.97,602.802,615.548,"Finally, I had the great privilege of appearing at the uptown alliance meeting here in my home neighborhood of uptown last week and it is good.",19,,
65,0.97,615.548,653.619,"I will generally say, to see more and more of our neighborhood councils beginning to transition again to try to have more Online meetings, to have this Online meetings have broader and comprehensive public facing programming rather than just convening briefly to accomplish business, I know that there is going to be a meeting coming up of the West hedge neighborhood Association in my distribute and I have had had the honor of appearing at the magnolia community Council I think last month, who is stepping up their virtual meetings as well.",19,,
66,0.97,653.619,662.928,They just want to say that I very much appreciate the opportunity to go and talk to the groups about what we're doing here at the Council.,19,,
67,0.97,662.928,687.353,I also appreciate seeing that the continuity is returning to our civic discourse here in the city and that we are figuring out ways to adapt and adopt these new practices to make sure that we continue to avail ourselves to the bodies ability to convey what we're doing to the memberships and maintain the communication in the neighborhoods of the city.,19,,
68,0.97,687.353,694.86,"With that, Madam President, I don't have any further updates.",19,,
69,0.97,694.86,697.63,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis for that report.",20,,
70,0.97,697.63,702.735,Are there any questions or comments on that report?,20,,
71,0.97,702.735,703.102,Okay.,20,,
72,0.97,703.102,708.374,"Hearing and seeing none, we'll go ahead and move through the roll call.",20,,
73,0.97,708.374,710.543,Next up is Councilmember Morales.,20,,
74,0.97,710.543,711.277,"Good morning, everyone.",21,,
75,0.97,711.277,716.282,There is nothing on the agenda from the community economic development committee.,21,,
76,0.97,716.282,717.516,I don't have a long report.,21,,
77,0.97,717.516,731.263,"I want to let folks know that I will be Co-Hosting a community conversation and town hall this Thursday with the South Seattle emeralds, so I'm looking forward to that conversation Thursday evening at 6:30.",21,,
78,0.97,731.263,750.049,"We'll discuss the budget Rebalance and the process in general and it will be an opportunity for me to hear from community members about their priorities, so if folks are interested in participating, please E-mail our office to Rsvp for the event.",21,,
79,0.97,750.049,775.04,"We participated in a board of health meeting last week as a member of the board of health, participated last week, along with Councilmembers Lewis and Mosqueda, and it is really important to remind folks that we are not meeting our daily target for new cases of Covid-19 and Coronavirus in King County.",21,,
80,0.97,775.04,780.112,We have three times more cases than we are shooting for.,21,,
81,0.97,780.112,790.89,"It is still really important for people to remember all of the basics, Wash your hands, wear a mask, stay six feet away from people.",21,,
82,0.97,790.89,792.224,"It is summer time, it is beautiful.",21,,
83,0.97,792.224,800.633,"The weather is going to be really warm this week, so I know folks will be out at parks and enjoying the weather.",21,,
84,0.97,800.633,813.779,"I'm still seeing a lot of people out not wearing masks, so we want to encourage people to wear their masks and to take the necessary precautions to prevent additional community spread.",21,,
85,0.97,813.779,815.581,It is especially important for young people.,21,,
86,0.97,815.581,822.087,We know that we're seeing more and more cases of people in their 20s.,21,,
87,0.97,822.087,831.797,"If you have young adults in your lives, remind them they're also at risk for infection, both for themselves and spreading it among family members.",21,,

89,0.97,832.398,850.549,"They want to be out playing basketball and riding bikes and it is fortunate remind them to do that wearing masks, especially among all of the other kids in the neighborhoods, because they don't want to bring that home to their parents or their grandparents or their elderly neighbors.",21,,
90,0.97,850.549,856.956,Just want to remind people to be careful and that is all I have for this morning.,21,,

99,0.97,892.024,916.382,"We have item number one, which is Council bill 119812 which provides relief to those who have been affected by Covid, our small businesses, immigrant and refugee communities, our families and neighbors, seniors, and individuals who are most vulnerable in the community now have the opportunity for tremendous relief thanks to all of you for all of your work to pass the Covid relief bill.",23,,
100,0.97,916.382,928.394,"Number two, on the agenda, is resolution 31957 which provides the spending plan details that correspond with the Seattle jump start progressive revenue proposal.",23,,
101,0.97,928.394,934.033,Thank you again for the long conversation that we had on Wednesday and for all of the amendments.,23,,
102,0.97,934.033,967.032,Everything from improvements to how we get dollars out the door for our smallest businesses and making it more intent is to REAS building affordable housing for communities that have been affected by red lines and covenants in lending policies.,23,,
103,0.97,967.032,982.414,With your support we have increased the language around labor protections and environmental justice protections which go hand in hand in the spend bill to truly create a blue green proposal as we think about a more resilient economy in the long run.,23,,
104,0.97,982.414,1005.537,"Most importantly, the resolution and spending plan bill related to Covid provide hope and opportunity and I think offer our residents a deep breath as they recognize that much of the Federal support that they were relying on is running out or the hope for additional support during Covid would come, it is not coming fast enough from the Feds.",23,,
105,0.97,1005.537,1024.289,It is critical for us to get this spend plan both out the door and into law and the Covid relief bill signed and allocated out.,23,,
106,0.97,1024.289,1032.297,We also have Council bill 119812 to provide support for people and businesses impacted by Covid.,23,,

121,0.97,1109.975,1125.657,"Also want to note, thanks to everyone for the ongoing work as we think about how we respond to the crisis that is institutionalized racism and everything that we're trying to do to respond to the call from communities.",23,,
122,0.97,1125.657,1141.907,"Last week, Councilmember Herbold and I talked a little bit about the journalist arrested and this week I also want to emphasize my support for local TV journalist, local radio and news outlets in addition to national news and independent journalists.",23,,
123,0.97,1141.907,1149.615,It is critically important for these news outlets to be able to do their job and I think it is important for us to follow through.,23,,
124,0.97,1149.615,1157.055,"I'll be working with Councilmember Herbold as we think about following through in making sure journalists, media reporters have the protections they need in order to do their job.",23,,
125,0.97,1157.055,1175.641,It is really important that we have the ability for folks to be out there to feel safe and to report on a daily basis the critical issues that are happening in our streets and just wanted to note that and I'll be following up after we get through Council budget process on those actions.,23,,
126,0.97,1175.641,1177.142,"Thank you, Council President.",23,,
127,0.97,1177.142,1179.578,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Mosqueda.",24,,

131,0.97,1189.588,1189.821,Please?,24,,
132,0.97,1189.821,1200.465,"Good morning, colleagues, good morning, on today's city council agenda, I have within item related to the transportation and utilities committee.",25,,
133,0.97,1200.465,1201.166,This is Council bill 119828.,25,,
134,0.97,1201.166,1210.275,"I want to, because we don't have the actual Committee, I want to go into details here at Council briefing so you're aware of this.",25,,
135,0.97,1210.275,1230.262,"As we all know, we're fortunate to own and operate our own utility enterprises with Seattle city light delivering electricity to everyone and Seattle public utilities, not only handling trash, recycling, yard waste and sewage and protecting city water.",25,,
136,0.97,1230.262,1234.499,Most cities do not own their own utilities.,25,,
137,0.97,1234.499,1238.07,This ownership comes with additional responsibilities and legislation.,25,,
138,0.97,1238.07,1255.754,"Council bill 119828 would authorize our city public utilities general manager to purchase four industrial Parcells to create an important Hub for water infrastructure maintenance materials, Sbu calls it a South spoils yard.",25,,
139,0.97,1255.754,1262.294,Spoils are the dirt and debris after completing vital utility repair installation work.,25,,
140,0.97,1262.294,1270.602,They're in an industrial area near airport way South and South Spokane street just southeast of the I-5 Spokane Street interchange.,25,,
141,0.97,1270.602,1283.248,"The spoils yard would provide a place for crews to store equipment and material needed to install, maintain, and repair.",25,,
142,0.97,1283.248,1293.325,"Pipeline Ruptures are disruptive and potentially damaging to public streets right away and sidewalks, back fill materials to restore the street openings must be available to crews at any hour.",25,,
143,0.97,1293.325,1301.7,This property acquisition would replace a yard at South Meade Street and first Avenue South which Spu has been leasing for over 14 years.,25,,
144,0.97,1301.7,1311.443,There is a similar Hub in North Seattle as noted in the central staff memo.,25,,
145,0.97,1311.443,1317.382,Utility has extent a considerable time looking for a place to buy.,25,,
146,0.97,1317.382,1328.927,The location of the parcels to be acquired minimizes action to the public.,25,,

235,0.97,1907.138,1911.643,I have an amendment related to this particular bill.,33,,
236,0.97,1911.643,1913.511,Central staff circulated this amendment yesterday.,33,,
237,0.97,1913.511,1932.697,The intent of the amendment is to extend protection for six months after the end of the state of emergency for small businesses and Non-Profits that are subject to in person operation limitations under the governor's Covid proclamations.,33,,
238,0.97,1932.697,1948.012,The intent is to recognize that small businesses and Non-Profits need an additional period of time after the state of emergency is lifted to regain their financial footing and this amendment gives them a modest grace period to do so.,33,,
239,0.97,1948.012,1971.202,"This is actually in alignment with legislation that the council passed in April, sponsored by myself and Councilmember Morales to give an extra six months beyond the state of emergency for small, commercial tenants and landlords to work out a payment plan for any owing, rent, or fees.",33,,
240,0.97,1971.202,1982.68,"Just as a reminder, commercial tenants and landlords, the city's ordinance does require the negotiation and creation of payment plans.",33,,
241,0.97,1982.68,1990.388,This is a legal requirement in the city of Seattle as a result of the bill I mentioned earlier.,33,,
242,0.97,1990.388,2000.631,Small business tenants have the legal right to insist on being able to negotiate a reasonable payment plan.,33,,
243,0.97,2000.631,2013.344,"Small businesses and non-profit Tenats who are experiencing difficulty working with their landlords can access free, legal support through Communities-Rise.Org.",33,,
244,0.97,2013.344,2017.015,They have a special lease tool kit and more resources.,33,,
245,0.97,2017.015,2036.2,"As it relates to items coming up in budget committee, I mentioned last week that I would be sponsoring, along with Councilmember Morales, an amendment to remove the Seattle police Department from the gate keeping function as it relates to referrals from the law enforcement assisted diversion program, otherwise known as L.",33,,
246,0.97,2036.2,2038.269,E. A. t ..,33,,
247,0.97,2038.269,2046.844,I want to share with Council members news of chief best's E-mail to the Mayor's office in support of this effort.,33,,
248,0.97,2046.844,2065.563,"I really appreciate the chief taking this step to make clear the police Department's interest in support of the change and in her E-mail, chief best said I'm interested in Reconsiering the requirement that police okay every referral to lead and Co-Lead services.",33,,
249,0.97,2065.563,2075.139,The services are needed throughout the opportunity and it doesn't seem sensible to require us to approve it before the people get the help they need.,33,,
250,0.97,2075.139,2090.755,"Due to staffing pressures and Covid-19 health restraints, we aren't likely to be able to Prioritize this for the indefinite future buttoned that, this is the type of work most people in Seattle think the police don't need to take the lead on.",33,,
251,0.97,2090.755,2092.523,I would appreciate seeing this change.,33,,
252,0.97,2092.523,2104.035,"As far as the status on the proviso, the law Department is reviewing the final language and I look forward to sharing it with you all soon.",33,,
253,0.97,2104.035,2122.086,"Items that are also within the view of the budget discussions and my Chairship of the committee with over sight on human services, we have discussed in the past the ways that Covid-19 uniquely impacts seniors.",33,,
254,0.97,2122.086,2137.268,"In addition to the health threats, which we're all aware of, the safety measures required are keeping seniors unusually isolated which is a quieter but just as concerning health threat.",33,,
255,0.97,2137.268,2164.996,"The human services Department has reacted by developing new programs and partnerships to combat senior isolation, some of which I have mentioned in the past and as it relates to the 2020 budget process, the realignment process, I want to raise the fact that I'll be bringing some amendments to help Hsd address senior isolation for the remainder of the year.",33,,
256,0.97,2164.996,2174.705,These are items I would have liked to include in the jump start Covid-192020 funding package.,33,,
257,0.97,2174.705,2184.348,"Basically the clock ran out on time to enable me to do that, so instead I will be bringing these concepts forward.",33,,
258,0.97,2184.348,2249.981,"One idea is to work to allow Hsd to explore opportunities to develop and support Recruisement so funds could be used to provide developments with housing partners, utilizing technology tools and convening stake holders to develop a Holistic plan for senior centers to be deployed in 20216789 one of the issues that has been brought to my attention is there is no sort of unified approach for reopening senior centers guided by both public health best practices and the unique needs of seniors suffering quietly in social isolation so rather than having one senior center doing things one way and another way, I am proposing that Hsd convene senior centers and come up with a set of best practices for reopening.",33,,
259,0.97,2249.981,2279.176,Another concept is to support a project that has begun as I think a pilot project but there may be funding expiring for it and this is funding for drive up Wi-Fi hot spots at 30 sites at senior centers and senior housing buildings using this model that was previously deployed through Seattle public libraries.,33,,
260,0.97,2279.176,2286.017,Lastly is a program to expand a pilot called stay connected with four Seattle-based senior centers.,33,,
261,0.97,2286.017,2294.692,"West Seattle senior center, the Pike market senior center, the Greenwood and North Seattle senior centers and Gen pride.",33,,
262,0.97,2294.692,2314.578,"The pilot program is sponsored by the University school of medicine and it involves phone and video Conferencing sessions with clients to to help resolve problems for anxiety, depression and loneliness and provide resources including self management tools for stress and anxiety.",33,,
263,0.97,2314.578,2329.694,"Funds may be used to expand, stay connected either by adding an additional site or serving more seniors through the current sites or by expanding the months of service in 2020.",33,,
264,0.97,2329.694,2362.626,"So, again, in closing, I'm appreciative of all of our efforts to focus on particular areas of need for the jump start spending plan for 2020, but I am feeling like there is a gap for services for seniors and looking forward to trying to work with my colleagues on the Council to close this gap.",33,,
265,0.97,2362.626,2364.328,In the budget discussions.,33,,
266,0.97,2364.328,2369.1,I want to also highlight some of the work that the fire Department has been doing.,33,,
267,0.97,2369.1,2378.943,I have been starting to report on the number of Covid-19 sites administered at the Soto Aurora sites.,33,,
268,0.97,2378.943,2397.394,"These are the sites that the Seattle fire Department manages and performs testing at through July 18th, I should say June 5th through July 18th, nearly 60,000 tests were done.",33,,
269,0.97,2397.394,2412.176,"The fire Department continues to increase the number of tests performed per day from 1,000 a day in mid-June to over 2,000 a day in early July at Seattle's city wide free testing locations.",33,,
270,0.97,2412.176,2422.853,"At the two spots, we have seen a positive test result over all of about 2.4% of results through July 9th.",33,,
271,0.97,2422.853,2442.106,Just want to notify the public that protests or participation in a large gathering is one of the reasons that someone could check for their visit to get tested since June there have been hundreds of people that have been tested specifically for the reason of participating in a protest or large gathering.,33,,
272,0.97,2442.106,2466.697,The data shows that only .4% of those individuals have tested positive for Covid-19 and I want to not only thank the fire Department for this work that they're doing but thank folks coming forward to get tested and please encourage others to get tested if they feel they have been exposed or are showing symptoms.,33,,
273,0.97,2466.697,2476.373,"As it relates to public health, I think Councilmember Morales covered this a little bit in her capacity as a member of King County public health.",33,,
274,0.97,2476.373,2490.721,The public health Department has reported the daily average number of cases has more than doubled in the last two weeks from an average of 40 daily cases in mid-June to 87 daily cases the week of June 21st.,33,,
275,0.97,2490.721,2502.166,"Most of the increases among younger people, over half of the new cases are among people aged 20 to 39, approximately 40% of those are Seattle residents.",33,,
276,0.97,2502.166,2517.281,The last four days the number of new cases reported by King County public health with the county are over 800 and an average of 200 or so more cases a day with 174 of those being in Seattle.,33,,
277,0.97,2517.281,2519.683,Testing capacity in King County has increased.,33,,
278,0.97,2519.683,2530.294,"If you're worried you may have symptoms of Covid or were exposed to Covid, you can seek testing right away in addition to the locations that I mentioned.",33,,
279,0.97,2530.294,2533.264,"Just so folks know, testing is free in Washington state.",33,,
280,0.97,2533.264,2534.865,If you don't already know.,33,,
281,0.97,2534.865,2542.573,"If you don't have a doctor, you can call the King County call center for assistance.",33,,
282,0.97,2542.573,2557.421,"They're open from 8:00 to 7:00 if you need an interpreter, you can say the name of your language at the beginning of the call.",33,,
283,0.97,2557.421,2571.502,It is really helpful to know we have these resources out there but what is most important is that we keep up our vigilance when the weather is beautiful.,33,,
284,0.97,2571.502,2576.941,Businesses are reopening with restrictions and we want to support them.,33,,
285,0.97,2576.941,2583.414,It really buoys my heart that when I go out almost everything I see is wearing a mask.,33,,
286,0.97,2583.414,2595.059,It is a demonstration of your care and concern for the people in our city.,33,,
287,0.97,2595.059,2605.102,"Wrapping up on the public safety elements of the committee, I want to share how concerned I am about what has been happening in Portland.",33,,

376,0.97,3355.719,3369.766,It is going to be an interesting path because we have Federal regulations that may stand in the way but I'm thinking we can work around them so we can move this property forward this is a great idea and we have a lot of community support.,37,,

390,0.97,3468.031,3480.51,"As Councilmember Morales suggested and you know as well, Council President from both of us being on the board of health before, it is just so difficult trying to emphasize over and over about the distancing.",39,,
391,0.97,3480.51,3489.519,I was at meadow Brook and I was at the park down by my house and there is not any social distancing.,39,,

393,0.97,3489.853,3492.388,Not everyone is wearing masks.,39,,
394,0.97,3492.388,3496.426,I think that parks head and I had discussions with the superintendent about putting up signs.,39,,
395,0.97,3496.426,3505.935,I think one thing that would be helpful is if we can do more public announcements.,39,,
396,0.97,3505.935,3508.371,We can certainly do that on the radio.,39,,
397,0.97,3508.371,3513.71,"As far as getting out the word, we have done everything we can and then some.",39,,
398,0.97,3513.71,3530.093,"Closing down the streets so that people have somewhere to walk if they can't get to the park, we checked out, and not to pick on any particular neighborhood, but Golden gardens and it was packed.",39,,

401,0.97,3536.132,3555.952,I guess what maybe something we can all talk Offline a bit about what we can do more as a Council because right now parks is--all of their resources are dedicated to the Covid response and the shelters and the community centers P we have had the same conversations with the library.,39,,
402,0.97,3555.952,3565.228,All of the staff is either furloughed or elderly and could be susceptible to the virus.,39,,
403,0.97,3565.228,3576.039,"All hands have been on deck to meet essential functions, providing respite and child care.",39,,

406,0.97,3588.718,3590.753,That is probably where we're at right now.,39,,
407,0.97,3590.753,3594.757,I apologize I can't be more positive or offer more.,39,,
408,0.97,3594.757,3619.048,"As you know, I think our cases in King County went up five or 600 more people in King County alone and so we haven't seen the worst of this virus yet and I guess it as Councilmember Morales and you were saying is we just continue to wash our hands, social distance, and wear a mask.",39,,
409,0.97,3619.048,3623.553,"Someone who is immune compromised, as Councilmember Mosqueda said or Herbold.",39,,

412,0.97,3624.52,3626.055,I say it all of the time.,39,,
413,0.97,3626.055,3630.593,"When I see people wearing a mask, I silently say a prayer and say thank you.",39,,
414,0.97,3630.593,3637.734,I know they care about my health and I care about their health and wearing the mask shouldn't be a political statement.,39,,
415,0.97,3637.734,3657.22,"It is just a statement about humanity and life and that we care about what happens in our city and in our County and in our country, but if you want, president Gonzalez, I can follow up with the superintendent and see what resources we have in the budget to maybe do more public safety announcements or Psas, if that is helpful.",39,,
416,0.97,3657.22,3658.588,I'm certainly willing to do that.,39,,
417,0.97,3658.588,3662.225,"Thank, you Councilmember Juarez, for the additional information.",40,,
418,0.97,3662.225,3679.442,"I certainly would be supportive of figuring out how we can do some additional Psas in that space, you know, multi-lingual would be helpful I think and anything we can do to support that would be great.",40,,
419,0.97,3679.442,3700.329,"I also think, you know, taking a closer look and perhaps a more aggressive look at how to open up more of our thoroughfares to allow for people to recreate and exercise would be really helpful.",40,,
420,0.97,3700.329,3700.663,You're right.,40,,
421,0.97,3700.663,3704.333,It seems like we're here on Mondays reminding people to do this.,40,,
422,0.97,3704.333,3734.063,"I know I'm using all of my social media outlets to remind people about the CDC and our Seattle King County public health recommendations and there is only so much that we can say and wondering if there is any opportunity for us to continue to innovate on how we use our realm and public spaces, I would welcome an opportunity to be supportive of the work.",40,,
423,0.97,3734.063,3737.533,"President Gonzalez, if I could add one thing?",41,,
424,0.97,3737.533,3737.767,Sure.,42,,

426,0.97,3746.275,3753.416,"These are community people that put on the vests, are not employees, are out there in the parks that gently come up to people.",43,,
427,0.97,3753.416,3770.5,"It would really be nice if people who when are listening would help volunteer for the ambassador programs because the employees can't do it all and again, last time I checked, we were around 60Ish Ambassador employees who put on the vest, they go to parks and street ways and remind people.",43,,
428,0.97,3770.5,3776.205,"It is a nice way to say, you know, please keep distanced.",43,,
429,0.97,3776.205,3778.875,Don't climb on this equipment.,43,,
430,0.97,3778.875,3782.945,This bench is closed so that is one way is if people are interested.,43,,
431,0.97,3782.945,3791.888,I know that the superintendent and the staff would welcome more ambassadors in our parks to help remind people about masks and social distancing.,43,,
