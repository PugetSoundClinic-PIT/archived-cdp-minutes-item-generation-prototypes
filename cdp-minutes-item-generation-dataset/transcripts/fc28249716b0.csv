128,0.97,755.888,759.058,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,43,,
129,0.97,759.058,760.926,Good afternoon.,43,,
130,0.97,760.926,765.364,There are no items on tomorrow's city council agenda from committee.,43,,
131,0.97,765.364,772.705,The next regularly scheduled meeting is Friday March 18th.,43,,
132,0.97,772.705,787.153,At Friday's meeting we will likely hear briefing on new bills sponsored by Councilmember Pedersen adding information about rent charge information collected under the residential rental inspection ordinance.,43,,
133,0.97,787.153,797.129,And of course that will be a briefing and not for a vote if we add this to the Friday agenda.,43,,
134,0.97,797.129,808.474,Also on Friday the committee will continue the discussion about how Renters rights are encroached in our city.,43,,
135,0.97,808.474,818.651,"My office continuously hears from Renters who are having their rights violated and far too often they find that despite the illegal actions by their landlords, they are not able to get justice.",43,,
136,0.97,818.651,824.29,I want to give a couple of examples the problems in Seattle's Enforcements of Renters rights.,43,,
137,0.97,824.29,831.931,"My office and spoke with Renters who have gone for months with no heat, no hot water, holes in the ceilings, walls and floors.",43,,
138,0.97,831.931,834.667,Mold or pest infestation.,43,,
139,0.97,834.667,846.212,Doors that are not secure and so many other unacceptable housing conditions that are violations of Seattle's housing code.,43,,
140,0.97,846.212,852.751,Me and my staff mentioned these before both in the briefing and also in our committee meetings.,43,,
141,0.97,852.751,864.73,"Seattle's rental inspection ordinance requires buildings to be inspected, but most buildings are inspected by private inspection companies that are clearly willing to file base of the conditions we have seen.",43,,
142,0.97,864.73,871.036,If a Renter calls the complaint line a city Inspector will visit the property.,43,,
143,0.97,871.036,880.779,The city inspectors are responsible and they do a serious inspection once they come to the property but that only happens after Renter calls the complaint line.,43,,
144,0.97,880.779,887.253,Most Renters don't ordinarily even though they can call and that there is a department.,43,,
145,0.97,887.253,897.429,And when some of the Renters do call it's when they are truly at their wits end and they have someone like the tenants Union actually letting them know they have this option of making a complaint to the city.,43,,
146,0.97,897.429,909.408,"When a Renter cannot take the conditions anymore and does get the inspector to visit the property, then the landlord is required to make repairs in a reasonable Timeline or face possible fines.",43,,
147,0.97,909.408,912.878,But the clock doesn't start when the heat broke.,43,,
148,0.97,912.878,919.551,It starts when they completed the inspection.,43,,
149,0.97,919.551,933.565,"Renters will be suffering for example, with no heat for months, prior to the inspection, get no justice for the whole duration.",43,,
150,0.97,933.565,937.836,Even when a landlord fails to complete the repairs in the time required by the Association they are not necessarily find.,43,,
151,0.97,937.836,947.913,In order to issue a fine they have to fill send it to the city attorney's office and they need to take the landlord to court to win a judgment for the fines.,43,,
152,0.97,947.913,956.355,In practice this means the city attorney's office give a lot of extra chances for landlords to complete the repairs before collecting fines.,43,,
153,0.97,956.355,958.857,Keeping in mind this happens in a very small minority of instances.,43,,
154,0.97,958.857,961.627,In reality most instances of Renters don't even know they can make the complaint.,43,,
155,0.97,961.627,982.715,"So what we see is a stunning statistic that the citywide, that citywide Stci has issued an last year only five fines to landlords.",43,,
156,0.97,982.715,987.82,This is another example of how the rich and powerful in our society are being held to a completely different standard by the legal system.,43,,
157,0.97,987.82,997.563,"In my experience the staff who work in the Department Instigated abuses by landlords and they do it thoroughly, they are dedicated to their work.",43,,
158,0.97,997.563,998.998,But the system is stacked against Renters.,43,,
159,0.97,998.998,1002.835,It is illegal for landlord for example to rent an apartment without giving notice unless there is an emergency.,43,,
160,0.97,1002.835,1021.32,"However, under Seattle's law if landlord makes the law they are issued a notice of violation that essentially says they have to correct the problem which is accomplished the minute they leave the apartment.",43,,
161,0.97,1021.32,1023.322,If they do it again they get another notice.,43,,
162,0.97,1023.322,1030.829,"In order to actually get a penalty landlord would need to enter your apartment without notice, stay in the apartment until the Renter context Stci and the Department issues a notice of violation and remains longer.",43,,
163,0.97,1030.829,1035.334,That's an example to show how the current law in the city needs to be improved.,43,,
164,0.97,1035.334,1044.676,And fundamentally we know all of these problems are the result of a terrible power imbalance between Renters and landlords.,43,,
165,0.97,1044.676,1051.583,"Just to give one more example, Avery recent one, my office spoke last week to a Renter in an apartment building that was gutted by fire on February 25.",43,,
166,0.97,1051.583,1058.223,I want to quote from the settlement agreement the landlord intimidated Renters into signing.,43,,
167,0.97,1058.223,1066.665,"""the parties agree to mutually terminate the lease agreement as of February 24, 2022, that is the date for the fire.",43,,
168,0.97,1066.665,1125.124,"All parties agree that the above actions by management contributed a full and complete settlement and discharge of any liability for any and all claims known and unknown suspected or unsuspected that residents are any guests or licenses or any other person or entity acting on resident behalf or subrogation of rights have or may have in the future against all entities comprising the management, individual officers, agents, employees, attorneys, partners, members, successors, heirs, and shareholders including but not limited to added utility costs inconvenience, loss of use of the apartment, property damage, lost wages and time and any possible health or discretion claim that may stem from or related in any way to Residency in the property ."" this gives you a sense of the absurd level to which rentals rights are violated.",43,,
169,0.97,1125.124,1133.198,"And to be clear, the so-called settlement agreement does not offer Renters one penny in compensation.",43,,
170,0.97,1133.198,1148.48,"Instead we heard from the Renters that the landlord told them they would need to sign to get their security deposit back which for low-income Renters, working-class people who are especially the ones suddenly displaced and searching for somewhere to live, getting back your security deposit is an urgent necessity.",43,,
171,0.97,1148.48,1161.293,So at Friday's committee meeting we will hear from the Stci about their enforcement procedures when Renters contact them.,43,,

285,0.97,2010.608,2029.027,"So I want to start here by responding to some inquiries from a couple of weeks ago now, I think, the state of the free clinic at Seattle center and whether that is going to be close to the climate pledge arena and if so, when?",58,,
286,0.97,2029.027,2050.148,"Just as a little reminder for colleagues, every year there is a free clinic that historically had been hosted in the key arena providing a variety of different medical services including vision, dental, and other things that many members of the community are only able to access at this clinic.",58,,
287,0.97,2050.148,2058.89,Making sure we can continue to host this critical service is incredibly important and understandably that is why it's the focus of many questions.,58,,
288,0.97,2058.89,2064.962,There has been some reporting subsequently in the challenges about getting that going this year.,58,,
289,0.97,2064.962,2091.789,"So I did just want to report from checking in with climate pledge and checking in with some of our partners at Seattle center, that my understanding is that climate pledge arena currently doesn't have a nailed down time to host the King County health clinic.",58,,
290,0.97,2091.789,2099.997,"And this is something that my office is getting more engaged in now, even some of the logistical challenges.",58,,
291,0.97,2099.997,2108.239,"As soon as we learned the clinic is not scheduled for this year, we convened a bunch of meetings at the end of last week to get to the bottom of the situation.",58,,
292,0.97,2108.239,2113.11,And make sure that we could start working on putting together a plan.,58,,
293,0.97,2113.11,2132.23,I am satisfied at this point from talking to the climate pledge arena that they did fulfill their initial responsibility per the integration agreement for nailing down some specific dates that they have sent along to the operators of the health clinic.,58,,
294,0.97,2132.23,2142.573,"But, none of those days, as currently presented, are sufficient for the operator.",58,,
295,0.97,2142.573,2151.916,The group also offered to use the crack in community ice Plex is a potential engagement site.,58,,
296,0.97,2151.916,2160.658,That apparently did not meet all the logistical issues the clinic has in order to be operational.,58,,
297,0.97,2160.658,2174.472,"The Seattle center is still set to host the vision portion of the clinic at the very least, in the way it's currently set up in 2022.",58,,
298,0.97,2174.472,2179.744,"As we know, that in and of itself is not going to be enough for the 3000 people who depend on the service every year.",58,,
299,0.97,2179.744,2187.451,"So I am going to continue to work with the clinic, Seattle center and group to see if there is a way forward to make sure that these critical services are provided.",58,,
300,0.97,2187.451,2197.195,I do remember a few years ago that we mitigated during the construction by making some of the facilities on the Seattle center campus available.,58,,
301,0.97,2197.195,2210.007,I'm looking forward to talking to the director and other folks about how we might able to emulate that practice from a few years ago if we still need to pursue some creative alternatives.,58,,
302,0.97,2210.007,2214.679,Given the current challenge.,58,,
303,0.97,2214.679,2216.747,That is the quick update on that.,58,,
304,0.97,2216.747,2227.892,I appreciate Councilmember Herbold and others raising this issue when it was presented to committee last month.,58,,
305,0.97,2227.892,2231.128,And we will continue to monitor it and provide updates at Council briefing.,58,,
306,0.97,2231.128,2234.165,Jacob in my office is monitoring this for me.,58,,

315,0.97,2282.913,2291.455,The mask mandates have ended as was alluded to earlier by Councilmember Herbold.,58,,
316,0.97,2291.455,2298.562,Patrons of the library are no longer required to wear a mask however staff will remain massed on library property.,58,,

331,0.97,2429.593,2436.3,I appreciate you reporting out that you are interested in following up on this issue.,59,,
332,0.97,2436.3,2446.21,"It doesn't sound like--as for this year beyond the vision clinic, continuation, which I think --",59,,
333,0.97,2446.21,2451.515,I apologize.,60,,
334,0.97,2451.515,2459.023,Madam President?,61,,

336,0.97,2460.658,2461.258,But I interrupted you.,61,,
337,0.97,2461.258,2462.092,I didn't mean too.,61,,
338,0.97,2462.092,2463.661,I thought I was Unmute.,61,,
339,0.97,2463.661,2476.507,"I just want to highlight, Councilmember Lewis, I appreciate again you're going to continue to work on this.",62,,
340,0.97,2476.507,2479.143,And I do appreciate that climate pledge arena did offer some dates.,62,,
341,0.97,2479.143,2487.918,It's my understanding that there was a date or a set of dates that were scheduled.,62,,
342,0.97,2487.918,2493.924,And what happened was that those dates that were scheduled were canceled because of who is coming to town.,62,,
343,0.97,2493.924,2499.697,I understand there was subsequent to that difficulty in finding dates.,62,,
344,0.97,2499.697,2532.763,"But I really want to highlight that the Mou the council passed under the leadership of Auras requires that dates be available every year, four days, for the Seattle/King County health over weekend including two days in Medially preceding the clinic and until 11:50 9 PM on the second day for move out.",62,,
345,0.97,2532.763,2534.598,That is actually in the Mou itself.,62,,
346,0.97,2534.598,2536.033,Is not satisfied by simply offering dates.,62,,
347,0.97,2536.033,2544.975,It is satisfied by dates being identified and scheduled successfully.,62,,
348,0.97,2544.975,2550.247,"Again, there was such a time and date that was canceled.",62,,
349,0.97,2550.247,2552.049,I don't find that acceptable.,62,,
350,0.97,2552.049,2557.955,I think the language in the Mou is really clear about what the expectations are.,62,,
351,0.97,2557.955,2559.99,Thank you.,62,,
352,0.97,2559.99,2571.568,"Councilmember Herbold, I appreciate that, and I appreciate the clarification, it's not just providing the dates, but nailing them down and making the facility available.",63,,
353,0.97,2571.568,2574.204,This is something that my office is going to continue to look into.,63,,
354,0.97,2574.204,2580.711,"Is one of my first memories of being on the Council, taking a tour of the clinic.",63,,
355,0.97,2580.711,2595.559,"And really, if we're going to start Reverting back to things, services and institutions that people expect to be operating in the city, this is one that we really need to make sure happens.",63,,
356,0.97,2595.559,2615.446,"So, we have made contact with them over this issue and expressed our strong desire to see this gets worked out in a way that goes beyond just doing the vision clinic and not doing the dental as well.",63,,
357,0.97,2615.446,2617.881,We will continue to keep the Council updated on that.,63,,
358,0.97,2617.881,2622.953,If I may just offer a little historical perspective.,64,,
359,0.97,2622.953,2638.402,"When we negotiated the Mou the operation agreement and the integration agreement, yes, it was deemed that we would continue to be committed to those clinics.",64,,
360,0.97,2638.402,2651.181,"My understanding, and I have not looked at it, I haven't had a chance to have a meeting, we do not own, we don't own climate pledge arena anymore but we did negotiate some things we wanted.",64,,
361,0.97,2651.181,2677.408,"My understanding, and again, I believe you have the Mou in front of you, but my understanding, recognition was that we had to do it as it related to scheduling permitted between professional sports and what live nation was because it's millions of dollars, for us as well.",64,,
362,0.97,2677.408,2679.643,I'm not saying one is not as important as the other.,64,,
363,0.97,2679.643,2689.186,"But I don't have those, in fact they probably got rid of them, did not get rid of them, they are somewhere, those agreements.",64,,
364,0.97,2689.186,2695.826,And Councilmember Herbold was part of those conversations as well as Councilmember Sawant.,64,,
365,0.97,2695.826,2707.471,"So, my understanding from talking to some of the folks at climate pledge and Obg is that they are still committed to that obviously.",64,,
366,0.97,2707.471,2712.543,And want the schedules to line up.,64,,
367,0.97,2712.543,2722.286,We had the same issue when we try to schedule stuff in the Stadium district.,64,,
368,0.97,2722.286,2723.754,"With the Seahawks, Mariners and founders.",64,,
369,0.97,2723.754,2736.1,"I don't think it is a lack of people don't want to do it because it's a mean corporation that doesn't want to provide services, I think it is more likely to hold them accountable for what we agreed the schedules permit.",64,,
370,0.97,2736.1,2738.535,That is where my push was and I will continue to do that.,64,,
371,0.97,2738.535,2755.185,"I want to thank Councilmember Herbold, I know you brought this up to Committee, Councilmember Herbold, but I wasn't looking at the Mou, I was going back and looking at the integration agreement and the operational agreement which is where I think the real languages but I could be wrong.",64,,
372,0.97,2755.185,2757.421,We can certainly take that Off- line.,64,,
373,0.97,2757.421,2780.577,"I do want to add, it is 100% true that things that are identified as community events other than the festival and South King County clinic can occur on days that the arena is available.",65,,
374,0.97,2780.577,2786.016,The other events are definitely supposed to work around availability.,65,,
375,0.97,2786.016,2806.637,"But the commitment for the King County, as I understand it, and I'm happy to in my understanding in the Mou itself by the law Department, to confirm my understanding of the nature of this commitment.",65,,
376,0.97,2806.637,2817.548,"My understanding is that those are events, the clinic and are not events that are not supposed to be scheduled around other things.",65,,
377,0.97,2817.548,2820.617,I'm not disagreeing and saying it's not true.,66,,
378,0.97,2820.617,2826.29,We don't need to drag a bunch of lawyers.,66,,
379,0.97,2826.29,2830.794,I think everyone is committed to that we are just trying to find those dates and make sure the commitments are upheld.,66,,
380,0.97,2830.794,2839.703,"My understanding is, although some tentative dates are identified, the nothing was actually formally reserved by the Seattle clinic on their side either.",67,,
381,0.97,2839.703,2845.976,It just sounds like there has been a lot of his communications between all the parties.,67,,
382,0.97,2845.976,2856.553,Which has resulted in the event kind of Slogging through the Seattle center and climate pledge calendar.,67,,
383,0.97,2856.553,2858.088,The fingers of the calendar.,67,,
384,0.97,2858.088,2875.038,"So, we are looking into it and I think the bottom line is, can we identify four days in 2022 where we can do this work somewhere on the Seattle center campus, be it climate pledge or somewhere else.",67,,
385,0.97,2875.038,2884.514,"We know in the past we have been able to mitigate, I went to high school at the Seattle center, very familiar with the campus.",67,,
386,0.97,2884.514,2886.216,There's plenty of space to do something like this.,67,,
387,0.97,2886.216,2895.359,I would hope that we could just come together and say this is something we need to do in figure with the bottom line is.,67,,
388,0.97,2895.359,2903.9,"I will say this, I do want to say that all the folks we have talked to at climate pledge are very committed to trying to figure out how to make this work.",67,,
389,0.97,2903.9,2907.137,As a good partner.,67,,
390,0.97,2907.137,2917.514,We haven't had conversations where they are trying to duck this obligation or not put elbow grease into figuring it out.,67,,
391,0.97,2917.514,2918.916,They are offering things to mitigate.,67,,
392,0.97,2918.916,2922.185,"Like I said earlier, the ice Plex.",67,,
393,0.97,2922.185,2931.495,They are looking at potential partnerships to bring in expertise or equipment from some other places if necessary to support the work of the clinic.,67,,
394,0.97,2931.495,2937.968,"So, I do just want to be clear that it is not like we are twisting their arm to do this.",67,,
395,0.97,2937.968,2948.779,"They are actively, they are trying to figure this out . that is why talking about this publicly is also helping.",67,,
396,0.97,2948.779,2953.45,I am sure this is going to provide some motivation to everybody to try to work this out now.,67,,
397,0.97,2953.45,2955.485,"So, anyway, we will continue to monitor and provide updates.",67,,
398,0.97,2955.485,2969.9,"Like I said earlier, if other offices have or want more information or want to check in, Jacob will be shepherding this in my office and reach out to him with inquiries if I'm not available.",67,,
399,0.97,2969.9,2973.77,Are there any other questions on my report?,67,,
400,0.97,2973.77,2984.114,Seeing then I will turn it over to Councilmember Morales.,67,,
