806,0.97,7275.868,7279.372,I was proud to vote for the funding in our original bill.,197,,
807,0.97,7279.372,7283.976,Our community partners can only do this work when we invest in them.,197,,
808,0.97,7283.976,7289.448,I've seen the work of those organizations up close.,197,,
809,0.97,7289.448,7314.373,I've listened to Seattle's young people share wisdom and build strength . I have attended the workshops with community empowerment and networks of mutual care and support that leaders in the next generation of Seattle have been forging . I've seen that power and vision that will define public safety in the city.,197,,
810,0.97,7314.373,7329.255,We need to save guard those investments . Today I am voting to override on all three of the bills to preserve the entire appropriation for the summer.,197,,
811,0.97,7329.255,7336.095,I remain committed to working out our differences.,197,,
812,0.97,7336.095,7338.731,I will consider legislative changes to work through our differences.,197,,
813,0.97,7338.731,7347.106,"I also want to make a statement today about a pattern that is potentially emerging, negotiating via veto.",197,,
814,0.97,7347.106,7367.393,"This process veto, negotiate, insist on sustaining commit has been wearing and I'm productive, intruding between frayed relations between the Council and the Mayor, there have to be better ways to us to resolve our differences.",197,,
815,0.97,7367.393,7374.633,"In the spirit of voting to override today, I acknowledge that some of the skills may need some revisions.",197,,
816,0.97,7374.633,7378.037,I'm committed to pursuing those Legislatively.,197,,
817,0.97,7378.037,7385.945,I am committed to working with the Council and folks in the executive departments.,197,,
818,0.97,7385.945,7397.556,"To safeguard the community investments, to reject negotiation by veto, and voting to override all three of those bills.",197,,
819,0.97,7397.556,7404.263,Thank you so much for those comments.,198,,
820,0.97,7404.263,7432.191,"I want to say publicly, like I have for Council member Peterson and Council member whereas, in the past I've seen you and your partner subjected to unacceptable behavior Online and in person I want to say that do not support that language that was being used toward you and your partner.",198,,
821,0.97,7432.191,7434.193,I appreciate your remarks here today.,198,,
822,0.97,7434.193,7461.02,"But really I feel that it is important for us as Council members to make sure that we back each other up in terms of the respect that is due to our families and partners, loved ones and I want to say I am is appointed that it is happening.",198,,

825,0.97,7475.534,7477.67,Thank you for mentioning that.,199,,
826,0.97,7477.67,7481.74,"Of course, sending you our best.",200,,
827,0.97,7481.74,7487.78,"I don't have anyone else in the Queue, I imagine because you have not sent me a message or show me your hand.",201,,
828,0.97,7487.78,7510.469,"Would anyone else like to make a comment on the Council bill, or about the legislation in the package? Council member?",201,,

830,0.97,7512.771,7521.914,I appreciate hearing comments from my colleagues about effort over the last few weeks.,202,,
831,0.97,7521.914,7535.794,"And before that, efforts working in collaboration with community labor leaders on the passage of the 2020 Rebalanced budget.",202,,
832,0.97,7535.794,7538.464,I don't take this vote lightly.,202,,
833,0.97,7538.464,7542.501,I participated in conversations about an alternative bill.,202,,
834,0.97,7542.501,7546.472,It was in the hopes of coming to an agreement with the executive.,202,,
835,0.97,7546.472,7568.694,I feel that the alternative bill offered falls short of the important investments and targeted strategic changes to the 2020 budget . including but not limited to a Seattle police Department budget.,202,,
836,0.97,7568.694,7593.252,"I am concerned that what the Council was offered Backtracks on the Council expressed policy objective, beginning conversations about making reductions to the Seattle police Department.",202,,
837,0.97,7593.252,7603.529,"Again, the reductions in the 2020 Rebalanced package do not in themselves result in the layoffs to officers.",202,,
838,0.97,7603.529,7628.687,Instead it results in the beginning of a process around bargaining . The reductions continue to fund several of the specialty units while making reductions of the specialty units.,202,,
839,0.97,7628.687,7638.797,Their proposal offered by the Mayor neither spoke to the Council's requests to make reductions to the specialty units.,202,,
840,0.97,7638.797,7687.246,"It did not offer any response to the policy discussions of why these functions should be continue to be funded, at the level that they are, without the Council preferred reductions or eliminations . Just reminding folks what those reductions were, those are 38 reductions suggested from specific units, including mountain patrol and school resource officers that are no longer working in the schools, that navigation teams, a reduction of harbor patrol, a reduction from the public affairs unit and a reduction in the Swat unit.",202,,
841,0.97,7687.246,7690.616,"Of the 38 proposed reductions, there were only 11 vacancies.",202,,
842,0.97,7690.616,7705.23,"Again that minimizes the number of true layoffs, if successfully negotiated, down to only 27 reductions in those specialty units.",202,,
843,0.97,7705.23,7721.68,"We also had 30 Ftes, of course given the hiring freeze, we may see those electricians realized.",202,,
844,0.97,7721.68,7737.629,"I don't expect to see those positions hired again, given the Mayor hiring freeze.",202,,
845,0.97,7737.629,7747.506,"And with Thereductions from General sworn officers, again the goals set in this bill is for 32 general patrol reductions.",202,,
846,0.97,7747.506,7781.874,"My question is for why there was not more compromise on this in this particular area, given that we understand that there were 24 officers on the Brady list . I would hope that the executive would support letting go of the officers who clearly cannot fulfill obligations as police officers.",202,,
847,0.97,7781.874,7791.717,"They cannot, because they have sustained findings of dishonesty, evidence of racial bias, criminal charges or convictions.",202,,
848,0.97,7791.717,7796.121,This limits their ability to testify in court as a witness.,202,,
849,0.97,7796.121,7799.458,It limits their ability to carry out their work.,202,,
850,0.97,7799.458,7816.175,Defense attorneys can Impeach these testimony and this limits their willingness to file charges when the only witnesses available are these officers.,202,,
851,0.97,7816.175,7819.178,The vast majority of these officers are patrol positions.,202,,
852,0.97,7819.178,7830.088,This is part of the reason the Council chose to request the chief of Seattle police Department to petition to authorize out of order layoffs.,202,,
853,0.97,7830.088,7832.791,I do hope that the commitment will hold.,202,,
854,0.97,7832.791,7860.986,"It is contained in the agenda item for the compromise bill, for the chief to work with the city labor relations director and the labor relations policy committee to develop a proposal for out of order layoffs in the interest of maintaining as the rule retire it requires a sufficient operation of the Department to work toward a shared interest in layoffs, not being the newest and most diverse recruits.",202,,
855,0.97,7860.986,7872.831,The Mayor's veto also removed modest salary productions for the remainder of 2020 four command staff officers.,202,,
856,0.97,7872.831,7878.77,I would have definitely entertained a compromise on this item in the compromise bill.,202,,
857,0.97,7878.77,7903.462,"I do not feel that the study of executive salaries as proposed allows this Council to take what I feel is an important position in this moment on leadership that has not adequately controlled over time, off-duty control costs, since the release of the city auditor recommendations in 2015.",202,,
858,0.97,7903.462,7913.472,The command staff leadership has not put an end to the sustained military response to what has been primarily peaceful protests.,202,,
859,0.97,7913.472,7924.983,The compromise bill provides just $2 million as opposed to $14 million for essence in community led organizations that will play a role in building community safety.,202,,
860,0.97,7924.983,7932.658,This is totally inadequate to the needs given the increase in gun violence that Seattle has been experiencing.,202,,
861,0.97,7932.658,7959.818,"I appreciate seeing that should this piece of legislation be sustained, should the veto be sustained, that we do have an amendment to suspend this inadequate compromise . I have two other points.",202,,
862,0.97,7959.818,7973.498,"The compromise bill provides just $1 million of the $3 million required for community resource to help build a community safety response, that will rely not rely on armed officers, instead of the $3 million required for full funding.",202,,
863,0.97,7973.498,7987.112,The deal strove to broker a place at the table.,202,,
864,0.97,7990.115,8009.468,"The community has been asking for a true Participatory budget process . There have been reduced Participatory budgeting to advisory group without real committee voice in the decisions, inserting another set of Stakeholders between the results of the community budgeting process.",202,,
865,0.97,8009.468,8016.675,And the decision-making around those investments.,202,,
866,0.97,8016.675,8021.713,"Trueparticipatory budgeting offers a place at the table for everyone has a stake in the outcome, it does not exclude voices.",202,,
867,0.97,8021.713,8024.483,Is physically designed for everyone to participate.,202,,
868,0.97,8024.483,8034.493,"The community members have been driving to work on unity safety, on kids, Undocumented individuals in our city.",202,,
869,0.97,8034.493,8041.8,"Folks expensing homelessness and the business community, it expands the table of voices with decision-making authority.",202,,
870,0.97,8041.8,8044.202,It does not make them advisory to do the work of others.,202,,
871,0.97,8044.202,8064.689,"Regarding that navigation team discussions, I was involved in conversations with the executive about changes to the operations of the navigation team, with a goal of delivering an agreement in the alternative adulation that would Moralize their commitment to doing work different Lee.",202,,
872,0.97,8064.689,8077.803,"This is a goal that I've sought for many years, most recently in an executive letter in April, enhancing this change Collaboratively, this letter was entirely ignored.",202,,
873,0.97,8077.803,8102.327,"The conversations we have had over the past week point toward significant and welcome changes in the navigation team that would likely result in fewer voluntary Relocations, more partnerships to mitigate hazards and obstacles and more robust services for people still living in Encampments.",202,,
874,0.97,8102.327,8111.77,The executive has indicated that the Mayor's proposed 2021 budget expected in just one week will include some of these changes.,202,,
875,0.97,8111.77,8125.283,They verbally agreed to Memorialize this intent we proposed language to do that and we were told it would be a Nonstarter.,202,,
876,0.97,8125.283,8132.757,Our conversation and verbal agreement Suffices . The reality is that I really needed to see this commitment in writing.,202,,
877,0.97,8132.757,8145.203,"I have next week, we will see the proposed changes in the navigation team, when the Mayor introduces a proposed budget for the next year.",202,,
878,0.97,8145.203,8164.856,"I am uncertain as to why, given the expressed intent of unwillingness to put it in writing, it is important, Overwriting this veto will not end outreach and engagement to people living unsheltered.",202,,
879,0.97,8164.856,8176.868,"It will increase the amount of funding available to external partners to do this work, by putting more funding and contracts with organizations that are currently doing outreach.",202,,
880,0.97,8176.868,8193.752,"My expectation is that those providers will work with the city and focus on Encampments the city identifies as high hazard locations or obstructions of the public Right-Of-Way, to work toward voluntary Relocations, in those instances.",202,,
881,0.97,8193.752,8203.328,I will continue to push for improvements in the way that the city response to Enchantments.,202,,
882,0.97,8203.328,8211.536,"In closing, as I said, I don't take this boat lightly.",202,,
883,0.97,8211.536,8225.35,"I hope that similar to the jump start legislation, the Council Mayor can find a compromise that would ensure resources at the Council would actually be spent in 2020.",202,,
884,0.97,8225.35,8255.347,"It is important to note the funding, stepping away from the alternate bill, it is possible that the Mayor will decide not to spend funding on important funding in 2020, it is also important to stand behind the vision that the county and community laid out in the initial rebalancing package.",202,,
885,0.97,8255.347,8279.904,"This outlines the vision with changes to the community safety and work Seamlessly with the budget bill, the Council is starting to define our ideas, informed by constituents and community, advocates and activists, it gives community members a way to hold us accountable, it invites the executive into a conversation with counsel on the best path forward to realize this vision.",202,,
886,0.97,8279.904,8284.542,I still believe that we can reach this promise.,202,,
887,0.97,8284.542,8301.459,"And really, I maintain my optimism that we will turn the page on this boat and begin a new collaboration.",202,,
888,0.97,8301.459,8309.467,Thank you.,202,,
889,0.97,8309.467,8322.747,"Thank you, are there any other comments?",203,,

893,0.97,8340.999,8347.072,I will be voting to override this unnecessary veto today.,204,,
894,0.97,8347.072,8351.71,This work is too important to stop and play political games.,204,,
895,0.97,8351.71,8359.317,I can't do my initial decision based on policy choices.,204,,
896,0.97,8359.317,8367.792,"I would change my vote on executive pay, there are aspects of the compromise bill that I really appreciate.",204,,
897,0.97,8367.792,8368.793,They are really important.,204,,
898,0.97,8368.793,8376.868,The compromise bill falls short of what is rightly known as a shared objective of this Council.,204,,
899,0.97,8376.868,8406.765,"I know that we can make the much Neded changes . What let us to the rebalancing was eight years of police reform that resulted in use of force against Seattleites exercising first amendment rights, worse than that WTO demonstrations, it was as if eight years of reform didn't occur.",204,,
900,0.97,8406.765,8413.071,The 45% budget increase in the last eight years went unchecked.,204,,
901,0.97,8413.071,8420.245,The changes proposed in the budget or not medical or earth shattering.,204,,
902,0.97,8420.245,8426.084,"They are reasonable, responsible first steps in a long process to Re- envisioning how we handle public safety.",204,,
903,0.97,8426.084,8458.016,"After months of discussion, determining when you can shift more resources, I like the majority of this compromise bill, but it did fall short by eliminating nearly all of the adjustments as if it move forward without attending to the produce discussed in the rebalancing process.",204,,
904,0.97,8458.016,8479.037,"These adjustments were mostly provisions as well . The final determination on how funding is used or not used would be distributed, to be made at a later date when the information requested was provided so that as a counsel we could make a completely informed decision.",204,,
905,0.97,8479.037,8483.842,This is a Multistep process.,204,,
906,0.97,8483.842,8492.717,I view this conversation around public safety as a Three-Step process that will continue into the next year.,204,,
907,0.97,8492.717,8503.261,The 2020 rebalancing was just a part of this process by investing in important pogroms.,204,,
908,0.97,8503.261,8515.24,Answering questions about how changes are made in the police Department and delaying the first step has already put us behind in addressing the crisis before us.,204,,
909,0.97,8515.24,8518.376,We cannot delay this any longer.,204,,
910,0.97,8518.376,8521.045,The second step in this process is this interim.,204,,
911,0.97,8521.045,8538.396,Between the rebounds and the budget to receive additional information on how we adjust changes in the structure to receive some of that information and to have conversations that many of us have had with the police in the last month.,204,,
912,0.97,8538.396,8547.906,The third step being the 2021 budget . This third step will begin in eight days.,204,,
913,0.97,8547.906,8556.281,This veto has occupied the time we could have been working together toward a better future.,204,,
914,0.97,8556.281,8565.924,"This, these last statements were intended for the viewing public, as all of you are more than aware of all of the work that we have been doing.",204,,
915,0.97,8565.924,8573.031,I recognize that the package before us to override or sustain is not perfect.,204,,
916,0.97,8573.031,8577.635,I voted to keep the navigation team in place without SPD involved.,204,,
917,0.97,8577.635,8584.008,I would vote to reverse the pay cuts to the command staff for SPD.,204,,
918,0.97,8584.008,8595.52,"But those policies outweigh the need to get money out to the community now and to make those investments, so we can scale up the programs.",204,,
919,0.97,8595.52,8601.96,"By the end of the budget cycle, we will actually know which programs we can rely on to be successful.",204,,
920,0.97,8601.96,8620.178,"I hope at this moment today, in a moment of shifting posture, we start to move forward in a collaborative manner.",204,,
921,0.97,8620.178,8629.787,I spoke to those achieved during the process and offered additional opportunities to have discussion.,204,,
922,0.97,8629.787,8635.193,We worked with her command staff to understand the Intricacies of the budget.,204,,
923,0.97,8635.193,8638.329,I am truly excited to work together.,204,,
924,0.97,8638.329,8647.205,Standing behind Ourpast decisions does not mean that we are not looking forward to working together.,204,,
925,0.97,8647.205,8650.074,We are still working together in the future.,204,,
926,0.97,8650.074,8653.845,I am a person who works with people.,204,,
927,0.97,8653.845,8660.318,"I want to find a common ground, share a vision, and to put that vision into reality.",204,,
928,0.97,8660.318,8662.387,There are more discussions to be had and more boats to be taken.,204,,
929,0.97,8662.387,8668.559,"If every branch of the city is talking to one another, we have more information to make the right choices.",204,,
930,0.97,8668.559,8673.798,"We have larger choices to make, with larger stakes at hand.",204,,
931,0.97,8673.798,8689.681,"And with Longer-Lasting outcomes . compromise, consensus, working together, it does not mean community via press releases or standing sending a notice moments before the Consulates.",204,,
932,0.97,8689.681,8695.253,It means we are walking that path together and finding solutions that work for all Seattle residents.,204,,
933,0.97,8695.253,8714.772,"I'm committed to making us making these important changes and I look forward to working with anyone in the executive office wants to work with me, anyone in any Department that wants to work with me, and all of the colleagues who I know share a vision of working together.",204,,
934,0.97,8714.772,8715.773,"Thank you, Council President.",204,,
935,0.97,8715.773,8725.883,"Thank you, council number, for those comments . next counsel never, please?",205,,

937,0.97,8727.085,8754.045,"Council colleagues, thank you all today as well . I want to reiterate my appreciation for all of the work that you all have done over the last few months, as we have been engaged in a really tough conversation in the midst of multiple crises, Covid-19, a housing and economic crisis, and the civil rights uprising that we are continuing to attempt to solve together.",206,,
938,0.97,8754.045,8770.461,"Seattle is at the heart of a national movement, to reduce incidences where black and Brown lives are taken on camera, on-the-job, and in the name of what has been traditionally known as policing in our country.",206,,
939,0.97,8770.461,8773.498,That is what this conversation is really about.,206,,
940,0.97,8773.498,8776.334,Let's look at what has happened across the nation.,206,,
941,0.97,8776.334,8787.345,City after city has recognized that it is an imperative conversation to have about the right size and scope of police.,206,,
942,0.97,8787.345,8797.688,"According to Forbes magazine, just last month there were 13 cities so far that are not just in conversations about reducing the size and scope, they have already acted and voted.",206,,

1069,0.97,10372.595,10373.129,Okay.,211,,
1070,0.97,10373.129,10380.87,I will make some hopefully quick remarks here and then we will begin the process of calling role on the various bills before us.,211,,
1071,0.97,10380.87,10389.645,Most of the Council members who have spoken have spoken to all three bills . are there any other comments on the other bills?,211,,
1072,0.97,10389.645,10399.422,I would ask you to be judicious about making additional comments.,211,,

1076,0.97,10448.271,10451.808,I'm trying to get some clarity.,212,,

1079,0.97,10476.332,10485.641,I'm going to make my remarks and we will go ahead and begin the process of calling role on this and then asking for more comments on more issues.,213,,
1080,0.97,10485.641,10495.952,"Colleagues, as I mentioned yesterday in the Council brief briefing, I do plan to vote to override the veto of the bills that were passed in the summer budget process.",213,,
1081,0.97,10495.952,10513.369,"Divestment from a broken policing model is the right thing to do . having spent over ten years of my career as a civil rights attorney advocating for police reform, I believe it is the needed course of action.",213,,
1082,0.97,10513.369,10529.652,"It is important for us to make sure that we continue to grow public safety . We need public safety that is centered and invests in harm reduction, not the ongoing status quo of the policing model as we know it in America.",213,,
1083,0.97,10529.652,10565.755,"Budget actions over the summer by the city Council was a starting place to get to public safety that truly includes and serves everyone, the Modernist actions of the Council taken over the summer were necessary, they were necessary to begin the process of divesting from law enforcement systems and incur several systems to begin investing in real community safety for all Seattle residents . everyone in our city deserves to feel safe in the community.",213,,
1084,0.97,10565.755,10588.244,"But the countless videos and names of bracket black and Brown lives lost here in Seattle and across the country have shown us that not everyone feels safe in their communities, and in fact, not everyone in the community is safe . We cannot look away from this.",213,,
1085,0.97,10588.244,10596.986,We can no longer accept the status quo if we truly believe that black lives matter.,213,,
1086,0.97,10596.986,10606.262,"When I look back at this moment in time, I want to be able to tell my daughter who I am currently holding in my arms, that I did the right thing.",213,,
1087,0.97,10606.262,10610.9,And that I voted on the right side of history.,213,,
1088,0.97,10610.9,10618.174,"Not for political expediency, not because there was a disagreement about where to put a decimal point.",213,,
1089,0.97,10618.174,10622.611,Not because of clinical pressure.,213,,
1090,0.97,10622.611,10624.981,But because it is the right thing to do.,213,,
1091,0.97,10624.981,10637.026,My vote today to override the Mayor's veto is one action to move our city toward a more just society.,213,,
1092,0.97,10637.026,10642.665,"As a policymaker, I looked at the budget the summer.",213,,
1093,0.97,10642.665,10643.899,It was imperative to do a few things.,213,,
1094,0.97,10643.899,10662.685,"First to make meaningful committee investments, build wealth and security, and second, to fund a robust community effort budget Participatory process that will help to inform and influence larger investments in the community.",213,,
1095,0.97,10662.685,10670.159,"And third, to take meaningful steps toward beginning the process of reducing the size of the police force.",213,,
1096,0.97,10670.159,10684.407,And that would allow us to ship some resources and other resources to community supported public safety programs centered on harm reduction and better response systems.,213,,
1097,0.97,10684.407,10697.453,"As a policymaker, part of my job is to have challenging conversations, to work to find solutions and collaborate with other parts of the city government, yes that includes the Mayor.",213,,
1098,0.97,10697.453,10698.421,It includes other Council members.,213,,
1099,0.97,10698.421,10736.392,"At the end of the day, city hall must work for the people of Seattle . facing the prospect of a sustained veto, on these budget actions that would result in zero changes to the police Department budget or operations, and zero investments in Community-Based alternatives, I felt it was my response ability as the Council President to ensure that city hall could still deliver on some investments for these communities, that we could fund some form of Participatory budget process starting now.",213,,
1100,0.97,10736.392,10740.896,We can work to right size our police Department.,213,,
1101,0.97,10740.896,10750.005,"Working with some of my colleagues and the Mayor, and see what it is and shall compromise would look like.",213,,
1102,0.97,10750.005,10759.415,"There have been claims, specifically by Council member swan that somehow speaking to the Mayor is a violation of the public meetings act.",213,,
1103,0.97,10759.415,10759.715,It is not.,213,,
1104,0.97,10759.715,10769.925,"It is part of our job to speak to people that we agree to, that we disagree with, and the people that we want to learn from.",213,,
1105,0.97,10769.925,10781.67,"It is okay for us to have conversations with each other, in an attempt Toidentify where the gaps are, and how we can bridge those gaps.",213,,
1106,0.97,10781.67,10793.449,"Counsel is the legislative branch of city government that can pass, we cannot force the Mayor to spend or not to spend as we have directed.",213,,
1107,0.97,10793.449,10813.402,"Make no mistake, the Council, including myself and the Mayor, we do have Stark differences of opinion, approach, policy, and what we believe are the investment levels into our city, and the programs that we believe Ae necessary to lift our communities up.",213,,
1108,0.97,10813.402,10821.076,City Hall cannot be gridlocked while communities are hurting and begging for our help.,213,,
1109,0.97,10821.076,10829.985,This is why I got to work with the Mayor and others to develop a potential backup plan.,213,,
1110,0.97,10829.985,10839.495,I did this in good faith and believe that the Mayor was also at the negotiation table in good faith.,213,,
1111,0.97,10839.495,10855.277,It is in this good faith that I believe that we found some common ground to bring together divergent visions for how to effectuate the Transformative changes to policing and budgeting that changes our status quo for the better.,213,,
1112,0.97,10855.277,10859.248,Is it perfect?,213,,
1113,0.97,10859.248,10859.415,No.,213,,
1114,0.97,10859.415,10864.253,Neither are the bills that we voted on the summer.,213,,
1115,0.97,10864.253,10876.799,The Council bill 119900 was the culmination of a month of intensive conversations and negotiations between my office and the mayors Senior-Level staff to find a way forward.,213,,
1116,0.97,10876.799,10897.186,"To allow us to put the summer budget to rest and to begin to shift our intention to the bigger, more important conversation that is the fall budget process . that process begins in seven days.",213,,
1117,0.97,10897.186,10910.766,The policies advanced in the alternative bill I agree are a far cry from what the council passed in August.,213,,
1118,0.97,10910.766,10918.507,To me this exercise has eliminated and quantified how far apart we are on the vision and approach for that of the Mayor.,213,,
1119,0.97,10918.507,10937.126,"Today I continue to support the budget passed by the Council, that was passed in August, and why it will continue to support the Proc process and the outcome of the votes considered in the summer.",213,,
1120,0.97,10937.126,10949.204,I cannot sit idly by and run the risk of nothing being achieved after this policy fight with the Mayor.,213,,
1121,0.97,10949.204,10983.405,"Turn the page, identify consensus where we can, make sure that we qualify when we are going to disagree, this is not about capitulation . This is not giving in to some power, this is about trying to make sure that we use this as a snow power for however long it is that we are privileged to have it, to make some change for the better.",213,,
1122,0.97,10983.405,10988.944,That is what this exercise is about.,213,,
1123,0.97,10988.944,11005.361,"The focused the folks on the veto and who doesn't does not have power, it is time for us to move past this back and forth and get to work.",213,,
1124,0.97,11005.361,11006.628,That is what we were elected to do.,213,,
1125,0.97,11006.628,11008.53,We can have differences along the way.,213,,
1126,0.97,11008.53,11025.481,The harder work is to try to see how we can get along for the sake of rising to the challenge and the occasion of this meant.,213,,
1127,0.97,11025.481,11041.03,"I think it is unfair for our supporters and detractors to draw lines in the sand, to proclaim that if we speak to anybody who doesn't agree with us, somehow we have lost our way.",213,,
1128,0.97,11041.03,11042.865,That is not the case.,213,,
1129,0.97,11042.865,11045.901,I speak to people that I agree with all the time.,213,,
1130,0.97,11045.901,11050.439,I speak to people that I disagree with all the time.,213,,
1131,0.97,11050.439,11054.309,"I do that, because it is part of my work to listen to people.",213,,
1132,0.97,11054.309,11058.213,And to shift through that information.,213,,

1134,0.97,11061.917,11065.02,This fall is going to be hard.,213,,
1135,0.97,11065.02,11081.303,"We are going to be faced as leaders in this city with some of the hardest choices we will ever make, facing a multi- hundred million dollar deficit in our budget . We will be asked to make difficult decisions.",213,,

1137,0.97,11082.07,11084.907,What is our Northstar and how will we work together?,213,,
1138,0.97,11084.907,11107.963,"These are things that we have to answer, and quickly, in order to make sure that three months from now, we are not sitting here considering and reconsidering the vetoed budget for the entire city . that is an untenable place for us to be, and an untenable place for us to go.",213,,
1139,0.97,11107.963,11139.094,"I am happy to stand with the city council . I am also hopeful that we will have opportunity to truly meaningfully move forward and get the work done, to do it as weakly and responsibly as we can, to the demand we are hearing from thousands of people who are contacting our offices every single day.",213,,
