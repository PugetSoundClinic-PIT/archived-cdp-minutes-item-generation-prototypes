147,0.97,1016.949,1033.031,"They will come downtown to do so and that is becoming less and less of a treat for them, because when they come down they made it very clear that they don't feel safe.",22,,

152,0.97,1051.283,1052.518,It is reflected in our business.,22,,
153,0.97,1052.518,1053.752,"Our guest counts, our revenues, are down.",22,,
154,0.97,1053.752,1073.071,"More importantly, we employ about 400 people and when I sent out a message last night to cancel a meeting this morning, so that I could be here, this is a note that I got from our human resources executive.",22,,

161,0.97,1103.302,1123.222,"That reputation and that reality is very much in jeopardy and there is a lot of factors we can attribute to that, but I would say much of it has to do with the choices we make as a city and as city leaders.",22,,

168,0.97,1162.694,1166.365,"This resulted in prosecutors and cops refusing to go after and jail evil drug pushers, destroying lives daily.",25,,
169,0.97,1166.365,1204.236,"Now we have racist police leadership getting rich off over time, not fighting crime, while previous counsel squandered their privilege, allowing lobbying efforts of the police director who is also the public defender, to add crack, Meth and heroin, then give her millions under law enforcement assistance with one caveat, guaranteeing illegal aliens pushing drugs will also be exempted from jail and deportation, all while cops conduct a war on homeless, acting like a hero to the business community, blaming--for all the problems.",25,,
170,0.97,1204.236,1211.81,"We have cops incapable of stopping drug pushers, which is directly related to all of the violence.",25,,

228,0.97,1547.078,1554.786,Public safety and criminal justice were at the center of the budget work the previous Council did in the 2020 budget.,32,,
229,0.97,1554.786,1565.697,"They made additions consistent with authority over that budget, which includes approving spending and oversight, so some of the actions will require or request reports.",32,,

231,0.97,1574.506,1580.612,First I want to touch very quickly on the issue of staffing.,32,,
232,0.97,1580.612,1595.393,In my time on the city council we have increased the size of the public safety budget by $100 million over about four years.,32,,
233,0.97,1595.393,1599.331,A lot of those dollars have been devoted to increasing the size of the police Department.,32,,
234,0.97,1599.331,1616.181,"Because of difficulties that we have had in meeting our hiring goals, and also reducing or addressing retention and reducing separations.",32,,
235,0.97,1616.181,1624.656,"A lot of that money has been spent on overtime, so we are still getting some of the increased hours on the street, but we are not getting as many of the new officers as we would like to see.",32,,
236,0.97,1624.656,1635.667,There has been strong consensus throughout the city over the last several years that we do need to grow the size of our police Department.,32,,
237,0.97,1635.667,1654.019,"So, some of the budget actions that counsel requested in November for this year will be to get an implementation plan and recommendations on the community service officer program and ongoing reports on its implementation.",32,,
238,0.97,1654.019,1657.222,The community service officer program is a counsel initiative.,32,,
239,0.97,1657.222,1675.073,"Two years ago the Council identified funding in the budget to reestablish this very popular program that allows, among other things, allows police officers, sworn officers, to spend more time on corrective policing.",32,,
240,0.97,1675.073,1695.894,"We also are going to receive ongoing reports from the police Department on meeting our staffing goals, as it relates to our plan to add 200 officers and those staffing reports will include not only the goals related to new hiring, but also our goals related to retention.",32,,
241,0.97,1695.894,1708.339,"The counsel approved funding recommended by the Mayor and the police Department, for recruitment and retention.",32,,
242,0.97,1708.339,1720.552,"A recruitment and retention plan and assistance deriving from the recommendations included in the final report of the police departments recruitment and retention Workgroup, great work that was done last year.",32,,
243,0.97,1720.552,1740.271,"Other focuses that this counsel really drill down on last year, relate to both the high jail user interventions that are going to be necessary to address what some people refer to as prolific offenders.",32,,
244,0.97,1740.271,1763.194,"There have been a number of recommendations to the Council and the Mayor from the municipal court on how to address some of those issues, so we will be receiving a report--on how to implement a high barrier probation program.",32,,
245,0.97,1763.194,1765.697,We are asking that the city auditor review the probation program.,32,,

249,0.97,1800.331,1803.034,$3.5 million in ongoing funds for lead.,32,,

252,0.97,1822.053,1833.131,"Lastly, I just want to share with the folks at this table, as well as the viewing public and the audience, an update from the city attorney's office.",32,,
253,0.97,1833.131,1840.872,This is in regards to the suspects involved with Wednesday's shooting.,32,,
254,0.97,1840.872,1847.946,Two of the suspects involved had no criminal cases referred to the city attorney's office.,32,,
255,0.97,1847.946,1860.091,"So the high utilization are cases that have been sent to the King County, the King County Prosecutor's office.",32,,
256,0.97,1860.091,1868.199,"The city of Seattle deals with Misdemeanors, so two of the suspects have zero cases referred to the city attorney's office.",32,,
257,0.97,1868.199,1882.146,"The third suspect had three domestic violence property destruction cases referred in 2015 and they had no victim participation, so they were not pursued.",32,,
258,0.97,1882.146,1893.224,"There was one theft case, where the city attorney Pled, charged the suspect and the individual Pled guilty.",32,,
259,0.97,1893.224,1902.3,This is the entirety of the cases referred and handled by the city attorney's office involving the suspects.,32,,
260,0.97,1902.3,1906.137,"There previous incidents were referred to other jurisdictions, including the King County Prosecutor's office.",32,,
261,0.97,1906.137,1910.842,"With that, I would like to handed over to chief best.",32,,

270,0.97,1935.333,1954.285,Thank you chairman and Council members for inviting me here today to talk to you at the public safety and human services committee about how the Seattle police Department is working to make Substantiative changes to the conditions in the Pike pine corridor.,35,,
271,0.97,1954.285,1959.857,Let me start by seeing what happened last week at third and pine was completely unacceptable.,35,,
272,0.97,1959.857,1970.768,I know each of us was thinking about those who were hurt and we cannot allow that kind of violence in the city and we have to do more.,35,,
273,0.97,1970.768,1972.971,That is why I am here today to discuss this.,35,,
274,0.97,1972.971,1979.177,"I want to tell all the folks I heard from the public comments, we hear you, we hear your concerns and they are very valid.",35,,
275,0.97,1979.177,1987.618,We will take every effort to make sure we keep this city safe.,35,,
276,0.97,1987.618,1992.724,"Nora Chan in particular, when you said the heart of our city should be safe and welcoming for all, I could not agree with you more.",35,,
277,0.97,1992.724,1998.463,I want you to know you are being heard and these issues are important to us personally and professionally.,35,,
278,0.97,1998.463,2013.111,"Before I get into the presentation, I want to take a moment to again thank all the first responders, particularly the officers of the Seattle police Department for their work that day at third and pine and the work they do every day.",35,,
279,0.97,2013.111,2019.317,We are asking more of them than ever before and they need to know they are being supported and that we support them.,35,,
280,0.97,2019.317,2031.863,"Last but finally on this issue, I think the media for continuing to provide photos of those wanted fugitives we are looking for who were involved in the shooting at third and pine.",35,,
281,0.97,2031.863,2040.872,I am going to start with a few data slides and then I will turn it over to doctor Chris Fisher and come back with more information.,35,,
282,0.97,2040.872,2046.444,"First I want to talk about, as I said multiple times, Statistics don't matter to the person who has been a victim of a crime.",35,,
283,0.97,2046.444,2056.687,"We know that, but we do need to use Statistics to provide important context and guidance about where we need to focus our efforts and what we need to do.",35,,
284,0.97,2056.687,2059.757,It can't be a guessing game.,35,,
285,0.97,2059.757,2062.393,We have to have some Statistics to validate what we are doing.,35,,
286,0.97,2062.393,2066.697,Across the city in 2019 we saw a 3% decrease in violent crime.,35,,
287,0.97,2066.697,2072.17,A 5% decrease in property crime and an overall 5% decrease in major crime.,35,,
288,0.97,2072.17,2074.572,I have heard the statements before --,35,,
289,0.97,2074.572,2080.077,"Please, I need--silence, please.",36,,
290,0.97,2080.077,2083.915,Please allow me to finish.,37,,
291,0.97,2083.915,2086.017,I will take my turn and you can take yours.,37,,
292,0.97,2086.017,2093.925,"I have heard the statements before that of course crime is down, people have stopped reporting.",37,,
293,0.97,2093.925,2101.165,I would request that they're no longer be any disruption of the chiefs presentation.,38,,
294,0.97,2101.165,2112.51,"One thing we know is that every year across the country and certainly across the city, that some crimes do go unreported.",39,,
295,0.97,2112.51,2112.944,We know that.,39,,
296,0.97,2112.944,2122.92,"But we also know that certain crimes, murder, burglary and motor vehicle theft, do have high levels of reporting.",39,,
297,0.97,2122.92,2125.556,"If you walk outside and your car was stolen, you report it.",39,,
298,0.97,2125.556,2130.061,"If someone breaks into your home and start stealing property and rifling through your personal items, it's reported.",39,,
299,0.97,2130.061,2134.332,"If someone is murdered in the street, it gets reported.",39,,
300,0.97,2134.332,2141.839,We know that that is actually scientifically or Research- based to be true and we saw a decrease in those categories in 2019.,39,,
301,0.97,2141.839,2157.088,"In the West precinct specifically, we had an increase of 3% of reported violent crime, most of that attributed to aggravated assaults and rapes.",39,,
302,0.97,2157.088,2163.961,"The West precinct covers Pioneer square, queen and and downtown.",39,,
303,0.97,2163.961,2171.068,"In downtown, the smallest reporting area we can look at that includes the Pike/Pine corridor, we saw a 5% decrease in reports of violent crime.",39,,
304,0.97,2171.068,2181.612,"The numbers are small, but 2019 was down compared to most other major crime categories.",39,,
305,0.97,2181.612,2191.322,"I am going to turn this over to one of my esteemed colleagues and members of my team, doctor Chris Fisher.",39,,
306,0.97,2191.322,2198.296,"He will take us through a few more of the data points, then we will conclude with what we are doing to address the current issues and current state of downtown Seattle.",39,,
307,0.97,2198.296,2199.297,"Thank you, chief.",40,,
308,0.97,2199.297,2200.131,"Thank you, chief.",41,,

310,0.97,2200.731,2203.935,We just want to give context.,41,,
311,0.97,2203.935,2204.902,So this is our dashboard.,41,,
312,0.97,2204.902,2216.147,We do a Biweekly meeting where we go through this with all of our commanders and focus on where we see crime trends.,41,,
313,0.97,2216.147,2218.849,"These slides, once confidential information has been rejected, are posted on our Website.",41,,
314,0.97,2218.849,2222.253,I do want to address the comment earlier about the public dashboard.,41,,
315,0.97,2222.253,2225.656,We've been working on it.,41,,
316,0.97,2225.656,2234.832,We changed our record management system this year and about issues making sure in the middle of the year that everything stays consistent from one system to the next.,41,,

327,0.97,2266.497,2288.886,"September, October and November were above, but generally the precinct as a whole was a positive story in terms of where the major crime categories were going, particularly the decrease in property crime and decreases in robbery and Homicide.",41,,

330,0.97,2306.137,2309.507,"Again as the chief mentioned, overall compared to a precinct or city these numbers are small.",41,,
331,0.97,2309.507,2315.646,"Percentage changes are large, but we did see five additional sexual assaults, eight additional aggravated assaults and 18 more burglaries.",41,,
332,0.97,2315.646,2320.017,"Moving to gun violence, this is shots fired.",41,,
333,0.97,2320.017,2322.553,We track shots fired in three different ways.,41,,
334,0.97,2322.553,2329.527,"Criminal discharge of a weapon, proven by eyewitness or evidence, be it Shell casings or property damage.",41,,
335,0.97,2329.527,2334.231,That is the dark blue on the graph.,41,,
336,0.97,2334.231,2340.271,"The light gray as Nonfatal shootings, where someone was hit by a bullet.",41,,
337,0.97,2340.271,2345.91,"And the dark gray on the end, those are fatal shootings where someone was killed because of gunfire.",41,,
338,0.97,2345.91,2350.381,"These are incidents, not the number of people hit.",41,,
339,0.97,2350.381,2367.698,"What we do see is West Precinct, shots fired in 2019 overall was down, with nine fewer shots fired, two additional Nonfatal shootings and the same number of fatal shootings, comparing 2019 to 2018.",41,,
340,0.97,2367.698,2368.899,We started collecting data in 2012.,41,,
341,0.97,2368.899,2376.207,Every week a detective goes through every incident that may involve a shots fired and reviews them.,41,,
342,0.97,2376.207,2377.208,That is how we compile this.,41,,
343,0.97,2377.208,2379.276,There is no charge for shots fired.,41,,
344,0.97,2379.276,2384.749,"You can see going back to 2012, the general trend for shots fired in the West precinct.",41,,
345,0.97,2384.749,2389.72,Is shots fired still dependent on somebody making a complaint?,42,,
346,0.97,2389.72,2392.423,"Generally, yes.",43,,
347,0.97,2392.423,2408.706,"If officers saw a vehicle or home that had gun holes in it, it is very likely they would note that and it could become a shots fired incident, property damage from a Proactive deployment of officers.",43,,
348,0.97,2408.706,2418.115,"If they find Shell casings and no one reported anything, it is hard for them to know that is a new Shell Casing.",43,,
349,0.97,2418.115,2418.849,Someone didn't drop it.,43,,
350,0.97,2418.849,2420.151,It's not something that got missed.,43,,
351,0.97,2420.151,2432.263,"So for random shots fired with no hard evidence other than casings, it is probably not, but if an eyewitness called and said I saw someone shooting, even if we can't find evidence that would get counted.",43,,
352,0.97,2432.263,2440.438,"I mention this, because I am concerned that the shots fired Stats might Replicate some of the other things we have heard about property crimes.",44,,
353,0.97,2440.438,2446.544,"A reduction in complaints, rather than a reduction in shots fired.",44,,
354,0.97,2446.544,2474.305,"I know in my district, District 1, both in South Delridge and South Park, people's experience of shots fired are increases, but the reporting doesn't always reflect the level of increase people are experiencing day today, because people just don't call them in anymore.",44,,
355,0.97,2474.305,2479.677,"Cities across the country, including those who have tried the acoustic gunshot Locator systems, they generally find 50 to 60% of shots fired are reported.",45,,
356,0.97,2479.677,2481.212,Depending on the city.,45,,
357,0.97,2481.212,2491.422,"A lot of that is cultural and the volume of shots fired, but that is with the research shows about reporting of shots fired.",45,,
358,0.97,2491.422,2498.095,"Then for downtown commercial, on shots fired, generally the numbers are fairly consistent and small for year-to-year.",45,,
359,0.97,2498.095,2500.13,Not a lot of variation Year-To- year.,45,,
360,0.97,2500.13,2500.931,Most years are 11.,45,,
361,0.97,2500.931,2511.242,"We have a few years where we had 14, but not a lot of variability in the shots fired reporting.",45,,
362,0.97,2511.242,2515.946,You do see some difference in the distribution of whether it is just shots fired or someone hit.,45,,
363,0.97,2515.946,2518.749,"In 2019 there were six shots fired, for Nonfatal shootings and one fatal shooting.",45,,
364,0.97,2518.749,2532.863,And that is to provide some context for the discussion and I will now turn it back to chief best to go over what the plans are.,45,,
365,0.97,2532.863,2533.43,Thank you.,46,,
366,0.97,2533.43,2540.137,"If you would like to speak in public comment after the presentation, you can do that and you can sign up over there.",47,,
367,0.97,2540.137,2542.373,"Okay, I will continue with my presentation.",48,,
368,0.97,2542.373,2550.381,"First, I have details of the past few days and I want to summarize where we are.",48,,
369,0.97,2550.381,2558.756,"We know we can't change the entire area overnight, nor can we resolve the complex issues that come together to lead to gang violence, mental health crisis, addiction and in Affordability.",48,,
370,0.97,2558.756,2564.261,But we are focusing our efforts and launched some new things.,48,,
371,0.97,2564.261,2565.763,First is the mobile precinct.,48,,
372,0.97,2565.763,2575.139,We are putting it as a base location within the downtown corridor.,48,,
373,0.97,2575.139,2575.673,Pike/Pine in particular.,48,,
374,0.97,2575.673,2578.175,Either in the 1500 block of third Avenue or at West link.,48,,
375,0.97,2578.175,2593.791,"We are also providing high visibility foot and bike beats in the area, including bringing detectives, you know on regular duty time, to put on a uniform to be visible and present in the area.",48,,
376,0.97,2593.791,2605.536,"We have also committed command staff, myself included, to be in the area at least three hours per week, uniformed, so have a full, visible presence in the downtown corridor.",48,,
377,0.97,2605.536,2612.042,We want to make sure that we use that increased visibility to make people feel safer in the area.,48,,
378,0.97,2612.042,2632.763,"The rotating Non-911 responders to augment resources, which means people we are pulling in from other areas are from the Anticrime team or community police team, who rotate in periodically and uniform to help with the resources in our downtown corridor.",48,,
379,0.97,2632.763,2639.87,"Additionally we are making sure his people come out of the Academy, not going into details about staffing issues, I think you all know we have them.",48,,
380,0.97,2639.87,2646.443,As they come out of the Academy we will deploy more resources to make sure they get their staffing up to their augmented level.,48,,
381,0.97,2646.443,2652.416,That should help with Deployments.,48,,
382,0.97,2652.416,2654.852,We are also focusing the work of community service officers.,48,,
383,0.97,2654.852,2657.988,They have three primary Prongs.,48,,
384,0.97,2657.988,2675.406,"Youth intervention, community engagement and also system navigators to assist us in reaching out to people who have a whole host of issues where we can refer them to assist and we will redeploy them with a particular focus downtown.",48,,
385,0.97,2675.406,2682.579,"When mental health providers come on board, we will ask them to pay special attention to our downtown area, as well.",48,,
386,0.97,2682.579,2695.392,"The expansion of the fire departments health one resource, having that additional resource available to help make referrals, we think will also be of benefit to the downtown corridor.",48,,
387,0.97,2695.392,2701.632,"Then we are working with private building security to identify problems they are seeing, as well.",48,,
388,0.97,2701.632,2705.536,"I have communication with them, with the officers in the area.",48,,
389,0.97,2705.536,2722.553,"The increased visibility in the Westlake area is intended to prevent criminal behaviors through discouraging it in the first place and being right there if someone is committing a crime in front of an officer, so we have an immediate and quick response.",48,,
390,0.97,2722.553,2727.624,"As we noted before, extra resources in the area are not new.",48,,
391,0.97,2727.624,2728.025,Excuse me.,48,,
392,0.97,2728.025,2734.598,But a lot of time those resources have not been uniformed and not been visible officers.,48,,
393,0.97,2734.598,2742.873,"The day we had the mass attack in downtown, we were doing a buy bust in the area, trying to take a drug dealer into custody.",48,,
394,0.97,2742.873,2747.945,So we have a lot of resources we are deploying that are not always as visible as our high visibility presence.,48,,
395,0.97,2747.945,2753.383,We are working on these prolific dealers in the downtown core.,48,,
396,0.97,2753.383,2757.354,The success of this effort will be in the number of arrests.,48,,
397,0.97,2757.354,2764.595,Of course if we see significant persistent criminal behavior we will arrest people and we do arrest people.,48,,
398,0.97,2764.595,2768.799,We will continue to work with prosecutors to appropriately hold those individuals accountable.,48,,
399,0.97,2768.799,2784.515,"Again, if someone needs services and are not Victimizing others, there is also an opportunity to divert them and resources they need through community service officers and mental health providers that will be in the area.",48,,
400,0.97,2784.515,2791.889,When it comes to investigations and intervention it is important to think about three very real challenges we are facing in this area.,48,,
401,0.97,2791.889,2797.294,Really the whole city and in some cases the entire country.,48,,
402,0.97,2797.294,2804.067,"It is a combination of behavioral health needs, people living in sheltered and outside.",48,,
403,0.97,2804.067,2806.837,The narcotics trade that people are so worried about.,48,,
404,0.97,2806.837,2808.338,"Additionally, gang and gun violence.",48,,
405,0.97,2808.338,2814.811,Each area brings unique issues that make people feel unsafe and actually make people unsafe.,48,,
406,0.97,2814.811,2816.947,They each need a specific type of response.,48,,
407,0.97,2816.947,2825.155,Right now we are working to arrest more people involved in the recent spate of shootings we've had.,48,,
408,0.97,2825.155,2832.462,We have made several arrests shared via the media and are close to making even more.,48,,
409,0.97,2832.462,2835.232,Getting dangerous individuals off the street immediately makes everyone safer.,48,,
410,0.97,2835.232,2844.274,The city and the Seattle police Department are working with trusted community organizations to develop youth and gang violence intervention efforts.,48,,
411,0.97,2844.274,2853.584,In addition to the recently released requests for proposals you've seen from our human services Department.,48,,
412,0.97,2853.584,2860.691,The Mayor has pulled together teams from the Prosecutor's office and others to focus on the most significantly violent and criminal actors.,48,,
413,0.97,2860.691,2869.499,"When it comes to the physical environment, we are working on a host of issues there.",48,,
414,0.97,2869.499,2872.669,"We need to do this, we know it has been done before.",48,,
415,0.97,2872.669,2876.94,"As someone mentioned in public comment, it needs to be sustainable.",48,,
416,0.97,2876.94,2890.721,We need a way to make sure we are keeping efforts focused and long-term and we are working with partners to address those conditions that research has shown can contribute to environmental facts that attract and support criminal behavior.,48,,
417,0.97,2890.721,2898.562,First we have a coordinated effort around third Avenue and Pike/Pine for improvements.,48,,
418,0.97,2898.562,2903.8,We have done crime prevention.,48,,
419,0.97,2903.8,2910.04,"We want to activate the spaces down there, so people see a visible presence.",48,,
420,0.97,2910.04,2915.545,"Not only police officers, but other personnel who can assist in this.",48,,
421,0.97,2915.545,2926.089,As well we are working with Metro and sound transit relating to issues around the bus stops and tunnel Entrances that have been identified.,48,,
422,0.97,2926.089,2931.161,"Additionally we are working with business leaders, many of whom are here today.",48,,
423,0.97,2931.161,2943.54,"We are engaging them as Stakeholders in the outcome, working with the office of economic development and the Department of neighborhoods and we're meeting with them routinely.",48,,
424,0.97,2943.54,2953.684,Talking with business owners to try to come up with solutions to address the problems that they are seeing.,48,,
425,0.97,2953.684,2960.59,I am going to close by saying that I confirm this cannot be a flash in the pan response.,48,,
426,0.97,2960.59,2964.294,We are using resources that will not draw off of 911 responders in other areas of the city.,48,,
427,0.97,2964.294,2975.806,"We have to use this approach to get us through the near term and we are assessing other options that can allow an effort like this to be maintained well into the future, when issues of been fully addressed.",48,,
428,0.97,2975.806,2991.021,"Again, Sustainability is key, making sure we have long-term results so we are not sitting at this table in the future, talking about the same issues we've been talking about for decades.",48,,
429,0.97,2991.021,2997.928,"We will address as much of this work with regular time and resources as we can, but there will be overtime expenditures as well.",48,,
430,0.97,2997.928,3002.899,"We can do everything with On- duty resources, but we are trying to do everything we can.",48,,
431,0.97,3002.899,3005.569,"Again, putting detectives in the field to assist with high visibility support.",48,,
432,0.97,3005.569,3022.352,"We will also be supporting investigative work and it will require some overtime spending, but we want to make sure we are addressing the narcotics issues that are current in town and working with all of our city partners and Stakeholders to make sure we have accountability in this area.",48,,
433,0.97,3022.352,3027.624,"Thank you, chief best.",49,,
434,0.97,3027.624,3039.036,"I want to ask, particularly a council member who represents district 7 and downtown, whether or not he had any comments or questions for the chief before she left?",49,,
435,0.97,3039.036,3040.871,"Yes, thank you so much.",50,,
436,0.97,3040.871,3042.139,Just a couple of things.,50,,
437,0.97,3042.139,3050.58,"First, chief best, I want to say how greatly appreciative I am for your leadership over the last week.",50,,
438,0.97,3050.58,3062.392,"As someone who personally has a Po box at third and Union, who walks that corridor on a near daily basis.",50,,
439,0.97,3062.392,3067.397,Who could have personally been in that corridor on any given week day at 5:00 P.M.,50,,
440,0.97,3067.397,3074.404,I feel this very acutely and share the frustration of my neighbors and business owners in that corridor.,50,,
441,0.97,3074.404,3077.407,I do want to start by recognizing the work that first responders did.,50,,
442,0.97,3077.407,3083.914,I really appreciate police were able to be on the same within 15 seconds.,50,,
443,0.97,3083.914,3089.586,The Life-Saving measures applied to the victims of this tragedy undoubtedly prevented further loss of life.,50,,
444,0.97,3089.586,3097.727,The quick work of police in identifying three suspects and quickly remanding one of them into custody.,50,,
445,0.97,3097.727,3108.238,"I just can't say enough about the professionalism and great work of not only the police Department, the fire Department, Emts, nurses.",50,,
446,0.97,3108.238,3111.942,"Actually, the Metro drivers.",50,,
447,0.97,3111.942,3119.85,Thank you as well for the work that Metro drivers did in quickly rerouting and cooperating with the investigation.,50,,
448,0.97,3119.85,3129.159,So I just want to preface my questions with that gratitude.,50,,
449,0.97,3129.159,3133.663,And it has been good to get information and briefings over the course of the last week from you and the Department.,50,,
450,0.97,3133.663,3137.534,Everyone has been professional and coordination has been close.,50,,
451,0.97,3137.534,3148.812,"This presentation, I noticed it wasn't kind of loaded into our presentation materials.",50,,
452,0.97,3148.812,3159.856,"Chris, if you could send that to my office I would like to send an update to my district to let folks know, especially the immediate next steps that the Department is taking in the corridor.",50,,
453,0.97,3159.856,3176.907,"One other area that I wanted to flag that stood out for me and I think it is an area where my office would like to work on possible strategies or resources, is that at least two of the suspects, maybe all three of the suspects, had active warrants at the time they were at the corner on third and pine.",50,,
454,0.97,3176.907,3223.653,"I know there is an active Department of corrections team that operates out of the precinct to go and find and Remand folks on a Department of corrections went back into custody and I wonder if there is a way that we can enhance the partnership between that team and the Department even further to be more efficient and effective at finding folks in the corridor with active warrants, particularly violent Felonies, where a superior Court judge has ordered they be remanded back because they want to compel their appearance for a hearing or a trial or whatever action in court they are on a warrant status four.",50,,
455,0.97,3223.653,3249.98,"I think given my experience and knowing warrants are typically issued with all the typical information and the photograph, that that could be an area of cooperation that could get folks who pose potential harm in the corridor back into Superior Court quickly.",50,,
456,0.97,3249.98,3254.851,I just wondered if you could speak to that a little bit potentially here and ways we might work together on something like that.,50,,
457,0.97,3254.851,3256.353,Thank you for that.,51,,
458,0.97,3256.353,3270.1,We have a neighborhood team that goes out every day and they have made arrests for hundreds of people in the downtown corridor who have warrants.,51,,
459,0.97,3270.1,3277.507,"I look forward to working with you in any way we can enhance that team and those efforts to make sure we are getting that information, but they do a lot of work in the area already.",51,,
460,0.97,3277.507,3285.682,They are absolutely outstanding in the work they are doing.,51,,
461,0.97,3285.682,3289.619,We are open to increasing that effort anyway we can and I look forward to working with you on it.,51,,
462,0.97,3289.619,3290.186,Thank you.,52,,
463,0.97,3290.186,3296.826,"I don't want to stop folks from asking questions they may have, but I also want to be respectful of her time.",53,,
464,0.97,3296.826,3304.968,She came with a very short notice on my behalf and I know she has another pressing appointment.,53,,
465,0.97,3304.968,3309.806,I think we have like 10 more minutes before we need to head out.,54,,
466,0.97,3309.806,3316.346,"Thank you, chief best, for being here today and thanks everyone in the audience for coming and sharing your frustration.",55,,
467,0.97,3316.346,3327.957,"One thing I didn't see in the presentation, I am glad chair Herbold said we would talk about it in the future, but the issue of police staffing.",55,,
468,0.97,3327.957,3335.765,"Talking to my residence in the past year, one of the key themes is we need more police officers and I agree with that.",55,,
469,0.97,3335.765,3355.185,"Looking back at the statistics, back in 2014, when I was a legislative aide, we had about 1355 officers and five years later we just have 58 more officers, so that is only 11 new officers each year.",55,,
470,0.97,3355.185,3367.13,So I am concerned about that and I know there was a report done in 2016 calling for 175 more officers.,55,,
471,0.97,3367.13,3370.867,I want to say I want to be supportive of how to help retain your officers.,55,,
472,0.97,3370.867,3376.406,"We talked about what a great job they did in this tragedy, so we want more of them.",55,,
473,0.97,3376.406,3389.152,"We want to make sure when there is a crisis, that other neighborhoods are still fully staff.",55,,
474,0.97,3389.152,3391.888,"Everybody deserves to feel safe, no matter where they are in our city.",55,,
475,0.97,3391.888,3395.525,We want to be supportive of that and please reach out to my office if you need anything.,55,,
476,0.97,3395.525,3398.128,Thank you for the support.,56,,
477,0.97,3398.128,3400.33,Staffing is one of our most critical issues.,56,,
478,0.97,3400.33,3412.842,"The Mayor's office put together a team to help us work not only on hiring and recruiting, but retention as well of officers.",56,,
479,0.97,3412.842,3415.712,"We are on an upward trend, but we could definitely use more staffing.",56,,
480,0.97,3415.712,3418.314,"The end of the year, 16 more than we started the year with.",56,,
481,0.97,3418.314,3421.951,We added an additional Academy class.,56,,
482,0.97,3421.951,3428.858,"We do immediate hiring, so the minute we have people hired we are bringing them on.",56,,
483,0.97,3428.858,3437.5,"The Council and Mayor's office approved a Lateral bonus incentive, as well as a new recruit incentive for people who come onto the organization.",56,,
484,0.97,3437.5,3446.476,"So we are working on a lot of fronts, again, making sure we support the officers and that they know that we support them fully.",56,,
485,0.97,3446.476,3455.885,"It will be an important piece of this as well, but there is nothing more important than the hiring, recruitment and retention of men and women on the police Department.",56,,
486,0.97,3455.885,3458.688,I appreciate your support and future engagements to help us in that effort.,56,,
487,0.97,3458.688,3469.766,"Again, in another couple of weeks we will be asking you to give us a report on the 2019 goals, versus what was achieved.",57,,
488,0.97,3469.766,3474.604,"We have slightly exceeded our goals, if I recall correctly.",57,,
489,0.97,3474.604,3480.31,"If you want a copy of that report, you do not have to wait for my committee meeting in a couple of weeks.",57,,
490,0.97,3480.31,3488.585,Feel free to Email my office and I would be happy to send you that report.,57,,
491,0.97,3488.585,3509.939,"In addition, I would love to share with you, Councilmember Pedersen and anyone else interested, the recommendations coming out of the recruitment and retention report and these are recommendations that SPD is working on implementing this year, along with the bonus program that you mentioned.",57,,
492,0.97,3509.939,3510.74,Thank you for mentioning that.,57,,
493,0.97,3510.74,3512.909,I forgot to do so.,57,,
494,0.97,3512.909,3516.446,One additional thing I forgot to mention is we are working on wellness issues.,58,,
495,0.97,3516.446,3524.153,We had a recent presentation for officer wellness.,58,,
496,0.97,3524.153,3536.332,"I think none of you are not aware that nationally there has been a trend in officer suicides and we want to make sure we are working to make sure officers are healthy and well in their current environment, so that is another issue that will be coming on board as well.",58,,
497,0.97,3536.332,3538.968,Thank you so much.,59,,
498,0.97,3538.968,3540.87,Councilmember Gonzalez.,59,,
499,0.97,3540.87,3546.643,Thank you for being here today and sharing your information.,60,,
500,0.97,3546.643,3554.684,"As many folks as stated, this is a Long-Standing issue.",60,,
501,0.97,3554.684,3559.956,"Downtown at these particular intersections have had issues for decades and as you mentioned, there are intersecting issues causing these challenges.",60,,
502,0.97,3559.956,3567.196,"You mentioned behavioral health, narcotics, homelessness, gang violence.",60,,
503,0.97,3567.196,3580.677,"While we know each of these may require specific responses, depending on particular issues, I wonder if you could talk about the dozens of initiatives we have.",60,,
504,0.97,3580.677,3582.045,We have a youth violence prevention initiative.,60,,
505,0.97,3582.045,3582.912,We have the lead program.,60,,
506,0.97,3582.912,3604.033,"We have different work groups throughout different city departments and it seems to me that if we were more strategic thinking about our outcomes and did a better job of coordinating some of these, that we might be able to move the ball forward and make some real changes in the kinds of interactions happening on the street.",60,,
507,0.97,3604.033,3615.311,I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about some of those initiatives and if there is a way we could start to coordinate those better.,60,,
508,0.97,3615.311,3636.065,"I know at the state level right now they are talking about a new coordinated body for Firearm safety, for example, to really start collecting data in a way that is targeted and strategic and helps us start to think about what interventions we need, but as you mentioned there are lots of other challenges, too.",60,,
509,0.97,3636.065,3637.467,So I believe that open for you.,60,,
510,0.97,3637.467,3640.336,"Thank you Councilmember, I couldn't agree more.",61,,
511,0.97,3640.336,3642.605,We do need to have a coordinated effort and response.,61,,
512,0.97,3642.605,3649.946,There is no One-Size-Fits-All answer to the things we are seeing in the streets and some of the behavioral crisis issues in particular.,61,,
513,0.97,3649.946,3662.291,"One thing we plan to do in community service officers come on board is in their role as system navigators, to make sure they are not looking at a silo.",61,,
514,0.97,3662.291,3670.166,"They are working with health one, with service providers, working with all of the providers that the human service Department is brought on as well.",61,,
515,0.97,3670.166,3680.61,"And Additionally, some of the private sector businesses are bringing in social workers for their businesses, too.",61,,
516,0.97,3680.61,3682.712,None of this can be done in a vacuum.,61,,
517,0.97,3682.712,3683.813,It will take a coordinated effort.,61,,
518,0.97,3683.813,3684.681,I couldn't agree more.,61,,
519,0.97,3684.681,3698.027,"Sharing information and referrals, that will only make downtown or anyplace in the city for that matter better and safer for everyone, including the people we are engaging who really could use those services to help them.",61,,
520,0.97,3698.027,3699.729,Thank you.,62,,
521,0.97,3699.729,3707.637,"I had one more note, and I didn't want to be Remiss and forget this.",63,,
522,0.97,3707.637,3715.144,"We have also been convening a Workgroup with public health, a lot of services providers there.",63,,
523,0.97,3715.144,3718.448,We focus on intervention and prevention for behavioral health and youth violence.,63,,
524,0.97,3718.448,3729.325,"I think again, coming together and looking at these things Holistically and not in silos will help us down the line.",63,,
525,0.97,3729.325,3730.927,Thank you so much.,64,,
526,0.97,3730.927,3742.772,Again I appreciate the time you are giving this Committee and members of the public on short notice and my many thanks and gratitude for the first responders in your Department and the fire Department.,64,,

531,0.97,3763.092,3774.27,"Now we will return to public comment, but I still need to make a motion to amend the agenda to extend the public comment beyond 20 minutes.",66,,
532,0.97,3774.27,3776.272,"If that is okay with folks, I will so move.",66,,
533,0.97,3776.272,3776.873,Second.,67,,

536,0.97,3784.881,3791.22,"Again, if folks could take the microphone to at a time or at least lineup, that would be great.",68,,
537,0.97,3791.22,3798.027,"And I am sorry, I did want to make one extra clarification.",68,,
538,0.97,3798.027,3815.945,"Because of the other items on the agenda, I would ask that you try to keep remarks to one minute for the second stage of public comment.",68,,

649,0.97,4299.795,4302.598,I will make it easy because I have to go run my business.,82,,
650,0.97,4302.598,4303.599,Thank you for all you do.,82,,
651,0.97,4303.599,4305.434,"Sir, what is your name?",83,,
652,0.97,4305.434,4308.837,My name is--and I own Cherry Street Coffeehouse.,84,,
653,0.97,4308.837,4313.575,You are not signed up at all?,85,,
654,0.97,4313.575,4315.444,"I am, you just have to look harder.",86,,
655,0.97,4315.444,4320.416,"First, I want to give my love and respect all of you that you try to do the right thing for the city.",86,,
656,0.97,4320.416,4332.861,"I give my love and respect to police and fire, but I give my love and respect and gratitude for all of you who make our community a community, rather than just keep clapping for police and fire.",86,,
657,0.97,4332.861,4341.77,I have been doing this for the last 30 years.,86,,
658,0.97,4341.77,4344.473,"Not four years or eight years, I have been here for 30 years.",86,,
659,0.97,4344.473,4347.042,I think people should appreciate us and give us the respect we deserve.,86,,
660,0.97,4347.042,4349.078,I think what you want to do sounds naive.,86,,
661,0.97,4349.078,4351.68,I think the sense of urgency is the most important element.,86,,
662,0.97,4351.68,4352.548,We heard this before.,86,,
663,0.97,4352.548,4364.893,They are going to build a hospital and we need to start to think like that.,86,,
664,0.97,4364.893,4369.198,"Putting more officers, that they are going to get mentally ill people back to jail, that we cannot do anything about.",86,,
665,0.97,4369.198,4373.102,You need to build institutions that take care of the mentally ill people and drug users.,86,,
666,0.97,4373.102,4377.906,I think that is urgent to do.,86,,
667,0.97,4377.906,4385.314,"Please elevate the sense of urgency, because that is what we need, thank you.",86,,

674,0.97,4409.638,4410.639,And I will make this brief.,88,,
675,0.97,4410.639,4423.418,Right now what happens in contract negotiations is a complete black box and the only way to Pierce that and really understand how we lose accountability is to have someone on the negotiating committee.,88,,
676,0.97,4423.418,4431.96,"I am a little horrified that what is being talked about today, the resolution is a Recapitulation of what is already Seattle municipal code.",88,,
677,0.97,4431.96,4440.569,"You guys only have two meetings before contract negotiations begin, so there is a real sense of urgency.",88,,
678,0.97,4440.569,4441.57,I will leave it there.,88,,
679,0.97,4441.57,4449.244,I did Email everyone on the committee this NOTE and I hope it is taken into consideration.,88,,
680,0.97,4449.244,4452.548,Finally I just want to say this.,88,,
681,0.97,4452.548,4453.882,I understand people's concerns.,88,,
682,0.97,4453.882,4455.35,I am also looking around.,88,,
683,0.97,4455.35,4458.687,I go to lobby days for mental health.,88,,
684,0.97,4458.687,4462.524,"We are number 50 for providing mental health in this country, this state.",88,,
685,0.97,4462.524,4463.659,Okay.,88,,
686,0.97,4463.659,4469.965,"The question is, I don't recognize any faces here.",88,,
687,0.97,4469.965,4472.901,What we are witnessing in the mayhem and chaos downtown is the outcome.,88,,
688,0.97,4472.901,4479.708,So we can't be angry at an outcome when we have not been paying attention.,88,,
689,0.97,4479.708,4480.309,Okay.,88,,
690,0.97,4480.309,4481.677,Unless you are taking care of people.,88,,
691,0.97,4481.677,4486.415,"I hope to see everyone here, if you really care about this.",88,,
692,0.97,4486.415,4489.218,"If you only want to jail people, I don't want to see you.",88,,
693,0.97,4489.218,4496.892,"If you really want to figure out how to help people, then come --",88,,

695,0.97,4499.228,4513.842,My name is Polly and today I am here to talk about the upcoming contract negotiations between the police Union and the city of Seattle.,90,,
696,0.97,4513.842,4517.346,The union contract is public enemy number one in regards to unconstitutional policing.,90,,
697,0.97,4517.346,4526.521,"The reason a Seattle police officer can punch an unarmed and handcuffed woman in the face and still not get fired, that's because of the Union contract.",90,,
698,0.97,4526.521,4527.756,How do we get here?,90,,
699,0.97,4527.756,4533.562,The negotiations are held in secret in the process is deliberately wrapped in confusion.,90,,
700,0.97,4533.562,4544.573,"There is the labor relations policy Committee, however they are not a vehicle for police reform, but actually are used to undermine reform.",90,,
701,0.97,4544.573,4550.946,"Councilmember morale is, your membership is deeply concerning to me, because what you don't know will be used against you.",90,,
702,0.97,4550.946,4559.288,"Simply put, if a Councilmember is on the Lr PC, they can't later vote no on the police Union contract.",90,,
703,0.97,4559.288,4574.403,"The community only needs three Councilmembers to reject a proposed contract, however, the five Lr PC members must vote yes on the proposed contract for the city may face a lawsuit for negotiating in bad faith.",90,,
704,0.97,4574.403,4596.224,"So the opponents of police reform, defenders of racist policing, many of the people shouting lock them up in this audience, they want people like Councilmember morale is on the Lr PC to ensure your voice and the voice of the community is silenced.",90,,
705,0.97,4596.224,4597.726,In other words it is a trap.,90,,
706,0.97,4597.726,4599.895,So I ask you to leave the Lr PC immediately.,90,,
707,0.97,4599.895,4602.965,"Finally, there should be a technical advisor at the table representing the community at all times.",90,,
708,0.97,4602.965,4607.903,The city must do better on this contract and it is time the community had a voice.,90,,

713,0.97,4619.614,4623.752,I worked in downtown for over 40 years.,92,,
714,0.97,4623.752,4631.226,"My experience is that it has never been worse than it is today, from a safety perspective.",92,,
715,0.97,4631.226,4640.969,"I believe the vast majority of all Seattleites, it is our community and city that feel safe.",92,,
716,0.97,4640.969,4644.039,"I don't care who you are, that is what you want.",92,,
717,0.97,4644.039,4645.34,We do not have that.,92,,
718,0.97,4645.34,4651.179,"As an example, the current jail we have today that was once overcapacity is at 25% full.",92,,
719,0.97,4651.179,4664.393,"Growing up there was a TV show I used to watch and the theme song was, don't do the crime if you can't do the time, sung by Sammy Davis junior.",92,,
720,0.97,4664.393,4668.797,"Seattle's theme song today would be do the crime, because you won't pay the time.",92,,
721,0.97,4668.797,4679.174,"Based on my past experience with the city government, I don't think much will change until the public mandates it.",92,,
722,0.97,4679.174,4680.208,I hope I am wrong.,92,,
723,0.97,4680.208,4687.082,"With that in mind, what we need and what I am focusing on is a citizens initiative to address public safety.",92,,
724,0.97,4687.082,4701.229,"I believe that can be passed by the voting public and force the Prosecutor, the city Council and Mayor's office to be forced to come up with specific ways to address this problem.",92,,
725,0.97,4701.229,4707.436,Thank you.,92,,

729,0.97,4720.916,4733.095,I think the current way we are handling the drug epidemic and mental illness is inhumane and unacceptable.,94,,
730,0.97,4733.095,4736.264,At our building in Westlake we have had continuous Break-Ins.,94,,
731,0.97,4736.264,4743.772,We have had drug issues and often people entering the building unarmed.,94,,
732,0.97,4743.772,4745.974,"Because of this, police have been unable to resolve the situation.",94,,
733,0.97,4745.974,4748.877,We have had to hire 24-hour security at the building.,94,,

752,0.97,4851.513,4853.281,These are critical issues we have to deal with.,96,,
753,0.97,4853.281,4859.154,What I have learned in my experiences sometimes you have to focus on something.,96,,
754,0.97,4859.154,4863.058,I am sure you have heard all the stories.,96,,

758,0.97,4874.336,4875.904,We have stores full of luxury goods.,96,,
759,0.97,4875.904,4876.938,A very easy transportation.,96,,
760,0.97,4876.938,4886.181,Very little police presence.,96,,
761,0.97,4886.181,4887.482,We have difficulty enforcing the law.,96,,
762,0.97,4887.482,4889.818,We shouldn't be surprised drug sales are taking place on every corner.,96,,
763,0.97,4889.818,4891.319,People Urinating and Defecating all over the street.,96,,
764,0.97,4891.319,4894.723,People Peeing on the restaurant windows of the places nearby.,96,,
765,0.97,4894.723,4897.325,It is a very special place and it needs special attention.,96,,
766,0.97,4897.325,4906.134,"Maybe if we can focus on one place, maybe four or five places, one in each district.",96,,
767,0.97,4906.134,4911.706,"But we can't just focus on the big issues, we have to start building and having some success.",96,,
768,0.97,4911.706,4922.951,One thing I want to say is I think we have to think very hard about the choices we will make.,96,,
769,0.97,4922.951,4927.656,We have to decide whether we will spend our money on new streetcars or new facilities to treat people with mental health issues.,96,,
770,0.97,4927.656,4939.167,We have to decide whether we want to protect everybody by keeping everybody out of jail or allowing for the fact that some people commit crimes 30 or 40 times.,96,,
771,0.97,4939.167,4942.871,I encourage you to think about those two things.,96,,
772,0.97,4942.871,4947.375,Obviously I appreciate what the Council has done.,96,,
773,0.97,4947.375,4953.982,"I hope there is some way we can get leadership across all these important areas, because it is not any one person's problem.",96,,

777,0.97,4965.794,4980.975,"One comment I want to make preliminarily, it goes to your comment when you talk about the fact that many of the people involved in the shooting last week, it seemed the city wasn't aware of them because of the Misdemeanors, but they were arrested multiple times.",98,,
778,0.97,4980.975,4992.42,"I am left asking, how in the world could it possibly be that the sheriffs Department is not communicating with the Seattle police Department, so you know you need to communicate and join forces.",98,,
779,0.97,4992.42,4995.49,It felt like you are trying to defray responsibility.,98,,
780,0.97,4995.49,5004.232,"To me it just puts the responsibility more squarely on the city, as to what is broken, and trying to make sure that the city of Seattle streets are safe.",98,,
781,0.97,5004.232,5011.306,So I will go back from the recent speakers and talk more I suppose on the people I see every day.,98,,

793,0.97,5071.065,5084.879,"I hear too many times they will not arrest somebody because they face so many responsibilities and internal investigations brought about by the DOJ thing that occurred a number of years ago, that binds them in red tape.",98,,
794,0.97,5084.879,5087.315,The inability to be effective in their jobs.,98,,
795,0.97,5087.315,5095.09,All they need to do is be effective in their jobs and be allowed to perform their duties.,98,,

799,0.97,5103.398,5106.334,Simply because they are allowed to do their job.,98,,

806,0.97,5127.155,5146.074,"I appreciate the sentiment behind the statements that we can't allow this to be the new normal, but to tell you the truth, for those of us that live there, that ranked as terribly out of touch with what is going on, because it is the normal of what we have experienced for a good long time.",101,,
807,0.97,5146.074,5152.08,I was here three years ago before this very committee after an almost identical event occurred at the identical spot.,101,,

927,0.97,5907.768,5917.278,"But given that they have served well enough to be reappointed, we defer to that recommendation.",123,,
928,0.97,5917.278,5919.88,"We appreciate that and with that, it is a 15 member advisory board.",124,,
929,0.97,5919.88,5923.817,"Right now we have 12 of the 15 members filled, so we have three vacancies right now.",124,,

933,0.97,5942.469,5950.644,"On that, before we move on, the roster suggests that all of the appointments have the Mayor as the appointing authority.",125,,
934,0.97,5950.644,5972.066,"It does not appear that there are particular seats that are permitted for the Council to be the appointed authority, so what I hear you saying is you have vacancies and would consider putting them forward as a mayoral appointee.",125,,
935,0.97,5972.066,5983.51,"Absolutely, what we do is we take the applications, look at them and make suggestions to the Mayor and ask the Mayor to please support those positions.",126,,

940,0.97,6011.338,6017.411,We have what we call an administrative rule that helps us implement and enforce the Seattle fire code.,128,,
941,0.97,6017.411,6027.554,"There is a new chapter in the fire code this year, with extra action equipment and he is part of the review process with that.",128,,
942,0.97,6027.554,6033.594,So his expertise is helping us Digest that and get that moved forward.,128,,
943,0.97,6033.594,6036.163,Fritz chess is another person we would like to be reappointed.,128,,
944,0.97,6036.163,6044.271,"Kurt Howell Lustig, bio technical.",128,,
945,0.97,6044.271,6045.639,He is our LABS research representative.,128,,
946,0.97,6045.639,6056.884,"There is also a new chapter in the fire code that I will talk about with Hugo, our last member, which deals with higher education laboratories.",128,,
947,0.97,6056.884,6068.896,"Again, Kurt's background in LABS is another great addition to us to help represent that industry when we have new chapters in the fire code that represent that industry.",128,,
948,0.97,6068.896,6071.231,He is able to speak on their behalf.,128,,
949,0.97,6071.231,6075.969,Brad Middleton.,128,,
950,0.97,6075.969,6084.411,"So, brad's position is with the building owners and managers Association.",128,,
951,0.97,6084.411,6085.212,He is their representative.,128,,
952,0.97,6085.212,6094.221,He worked with urban Renaissance group.,128,,
953,0.97,6094.221,6097.224,"Brad has been in several meetings I have been at, besides the Advisory board.",128,,
954,0.97,6097.224,6100.294,Other meetings we have gone to together to talk about the Seattle fire prevention office.,128,,
955,0.97,6100.294,6108.235,Brad is there to represent the building owners and managers any time there is something that might be a requirement that is hard and fast in the Seattle fire code.,128,,
956,0.97,6108.235,6121.448,"Brad will say, is there a chance that we can maybe just work through those and find different things that can make things more palatable to the building owners and managers.",128,,
957,0.97,6121.448,6123.283,So brad does an excellent job representing the group.,128,,
958,0.97,6123.283,6140.868,"And I think Hugo, Hugo worked for the University of Washington and he stepped up and is one of our vice chairs right now.",128,,
959,0.97,6140.868,6151.411,"He also has a certification as a fire Inspector, so that is something I am happy he went through and got.",128,,
960,0.97,6151.411,6155.549,"Also a certified fire investigator, also.",128,,
961,0.97,6155.549,6164.458,He fills the role of our major institutions and with that is the new chapter I was talking about with higher education laboratories.,128,,
962,0.97,6164.458,6175.669,We were able to use his connections through Uw to take an entire chapter and decide not to make any significant changes.,128,,
963,0.97,6175.669,6183.911,"They reviewed it with their group and brought it back to us with any changes they suggested, so we worked together with them and without his support we would be missing that connection with Uw.",128,,
964,0.97,6183.911,6190.784,So we respectfully ask for all of these appointments to be reaffirmed and we can continue on with the good work.,128,,
965,0.97,6190.784,6192.286,Thank you.,129,,
966,0.97,6192.286,6193.52,When do we expect recommendations?,129,,
967,0.97,6193.52,6210.137,"You will be seeing it, the 2018 fire code has been reviewed by the state of Washington and goes into effect July 1 of this year, so the Council will be singing work probably in the next 90 days.",130,,
968,0.97,6210.137,6220.547,And maybe we will have some of the fire code board members come and participate in the presentation.,131,,
969,0.97,6220.547,6226.253,"Absolutely, our Chairperson will definitely be there, but we will invite all of them.",132,,
970,0.97,6226.253,6245.939,"I just want to underscore that this entity has requirements for specific issue area expertise and so these five folks that are in front of us today, one fills the requirement for a chemical engineer.",133,,
971,0.97,6245.939,6252.846,The other one fulfills a requirement for somebody with experience in manufacturing.,133,,
972,0.97,6252.846,6256.883,One fulfills the requirement for experience and research LABS.,133,,
973,0.97,6256.883,6262.389,One represents--and one is representing Seattle's major institutions.,133,,
974,0.97,6262.389,6278.605,"I think that framework not only allows for relevant expertise to be represented on the Advisory board, but also allows for a sort of feedback loop for those who represent larger organizations.",133,,
975,0.97,6278.605,6283.11,So I appreciate the thought going into this.,133,,
976,0.97,6283.11,6287.881,Please let the appointees know that we appreciate their ongoing work.,133,,
977,0.97,6287.881,6288.882,Any questions?,133,,
978,0.97,6288.882,6305.065,"Okay, with that I will move appointment 01533, appointment 01534, appointment 01535, appointment 01536, and appointment 01537.",133,,
979,0.97,6305.065,6305.399,Seconded.,134,,
980,0.97,6305.399,6305.999,Thank you.,135,,
981,0.97,6305.999,6312.339,"All those in favor--none opposed, none abstaining.",135,,
982,0.97,6312.339,6314.474,Those five appointments will move on to full Council on Monday.,135,,
983,0.97,6314.474,6319.212,Thank you very much.,135,,
984,0.97,6319.212,6320.047,Thank you so much.,136,,
985,0.97,6320.047,6323.016,"Alex, can you read item 7 in the record please.",137,,
986,0.97,6323.016,6341.668,"Item 7, resolution 31 930, a resolution affirming the city's good faith intent to consider raising in the collective bargaining process for the Seattle police officers killed 2021 contract renewal police accountability proposals that have been identified by the public and the city's police oversight agencies.",138,,
987,0.97,6341.668,6351.912,Thank you.,139,,
988,0.97,6353.613,6354.981,Thank you all for joining us.,140,,
989,0.97,6354.981,6358.485,We can do a quick round of introductions and then we will turn it back over to Greg.,140,,
990,0.97,6358.485,6360.887,"Q, Greg Doss, central staff.",141,,
991,0.97,6360.887,6368.395,Cochair of the CPC.,142,,
992,0.97,6368.395,6369.963,Thank you all for being here today.,143,,
993,0.97,6369.963,6382.809,"Before Greg shares with the Council at this table today, as well as the viewing public, the contents of this resolution, just a quick bit of background.",143,,
994,0.97,6382.809,6392.786,"The previous public safety chair, now Council President, presided over a public hearing for the end of last year.",143,,
995,0.97,6392.786,6402.796,"That public hearing is required by the municipal code to hear from members of the public, their recommendations for consideration in negotiations in the Spog contract.",143,,
996,0.97,6402.796,6411.638,That public hearing has to Úhappen 90 days prior to the beginning of contract negotiations.,143,,
997,0.97,6411.638,6427.387,"We heard from members of the public, as well as we heard also feedback and comment from the three legs of our public accountability stool.",143,,
998,0.97,6427.387,6438.565,"The Office of professional accountability, the office of the inspector general and the community policing--and this resolution is intended to identify some of the things we heard.",143,,
999,0.97,6438.565,6444.571,We passed resolutions after the public hearing in past years.,143,,
1000,0.97,6444.571,6452.145,"We have not done so every time, but we have done so in past years.",143,,
1001,0.97,6452.145,6467.26,"As the chair of this Committee I think it is a useful exercise just to sort of socialize the Council and the public on what the top, important issues are, prior to us going into negotiations.",143,,
1002,0.97,6467.26,6474.901,"Thank you, Madam chair, you did a great job summarizing.",144,,
1003,0.97,6474.901,6479.973,"I don't have a lot to add but I will read the appropriate measures in the resolution, so they are on the record.",144,,
1004,0.97,6479.973,6484.811,"Several statements, several pages, I am just going to hit the high points.",144,,
1005,0.97,6484.811,6501.228,"One of them indicates the city council recognizes the sacrifices and contribution of the police Guild members and strives to ensure the city achieves its public safety goals, while being strong partners in ongoing efforts to implement reform and accountability structures.",144,,
1006,0.97,6501.228,6510.637,"Statements note that the city council recognizes the right of the Guild and all employees to collectively bargain for wages, hours and working conditions for all of the members.",144,,
1007,0.97,6510.637,6520.347,"They indicate that the collective bargaining agreement between the city of Seattle and Spog will expire December 31, 2020.",144,,
1008,0.97,6520.347,6526.419,Parties will begin negotiating the contract in March of this year.,144,,
1009,0.97,6526.419,6541.434,"They cite subsection 4.0 4.120, which requires the labor policy and public safety committees told a hearing on the effectiveness of the accountability system and that meeting has to be 90 days before bargaining begins with the Guild.",144,,
1010,0.97,6541.434,6554.848,"They indicate that such a hearing was held December 5, as you mentioned, and there was input received from the accountability partners.",144,,
1011,0.97,6554.848,6561.588,"The Office of police accountability, community police Commission and office of Inspector General for public safety, sitting with me.",144,,
1012,0.97,6561.588,6571.097,As well as 32 citizens that provided personal testimony or represented nonprofit groups or had a stake in community police accountability.,144,,
1013,0.97,6571.097,6611.838,"Finally, the statements note that the city council passed at the same time as the last Spog agreement, resolution 3.815 which recommends the city petition the court to change certain contract terms, some of which were articulated in the hearing on December 5. the operative section simply States the city of Seattle will consider in good faith whether or not to carry forward these interests through various means including but not limited to enactment of legislation, development of bargaining goals and objectives and facilitating community police dialogue.",144,,
1014,0.97,6611.838,6620.914,"To the extent that Washington law requires any changes to be bargained with employee representatives, the city will seek to discharge such obligations in good faith.",144,,
1015,0.97,6620.914,6632.859,"As you requested, folks to my left have provided written input that supports their statements on December 5 and those letters are ready to be attached to this resolution at the end of this hearing.",144,,
1016,0.97,6632.859,6636.129,Thank you.,145,,
1017,0.97,6636.129,6637.297,So we do have potential amendments.,145,,
1018,0.97,6637.297,6651.378,"Before we move on to that, I want to give the representatives from OPA, Oig and the CPC an opportunity to speak to the priorities contained in this resolution.",145,,
1019,0.97,6651.378,6659.085,"So, thank you very much for having us today and thank you for having us at the December 5 hearing.",146,,
1020,0.97,6659.085,6664.491,"Obviously, more than anything OPA does, this contract impacts us the most.",146,,
1021,0.97,6664.491,6673.266,Probably 90% of our investigations involve officers and sergeants who are part of the Spog Union.,146,,
1022,0.97,6673.266,6680.407,"In advance of the December 5 hearing, both Oig and OPA identified what our priorities are for the contract.",146,,
1023,0.97,6680.407,6681.808,Of course we couldn't give everything.,146,,
1024,0.97,6681.808,6685.111,It is a long contract.,146,,
1025,0.97,6685.111,6695.422,"I think 3.6 is, you know, 20 pages or so, so there is a lot there.",146,,
1026,0.97,6695.422,6701.528,Generally I think OPA's thoughts fall into three categories.,146,,
1027,0.97,6701.528,6707.167,"First, they concern the deadline I think everyone is familiar with.",146,,
1028,0.97,6707.167,6716.576,The deadline governs when OPA has to complete investigation in order to sustain findings or impose discipline.,146,,
1029,0.97,6716.576,6720.814,"Under the Spm a contract, the city negotiated a very simplified deadline.",146,,
1030,0.97,6720.814,6725.852,It is when OPA knew or should have known of the conduct.,146,,
1031,0.97,6725.852,6733.96,One of the things we are asking is the city consider simplifying that to make it easier to follow up with the officers themselves.,146,,
1032,0.97,6733.96,6738.865,We also talked about pulling the deadline.,146,,
1033,0.97,6738.865,6747.173,Right now it does not hold in a criminal case is being investigated.,146,,
1034,0.97,6747.173,6748.742,"For example, OPA receives a criminal allegation.",146,,
1035,0.97,6748.742,6751.744,"If it occurs in the city of Seattle, we send it back to the police Department.",146,,
1036,0.97,6751.744,6755.582,"If we do so, the Timeline doesn't stop running.",146,,
1037,0.97,6755.582,6756.783,The clock Steeps ticking.,146,,
1038,0.97,6756.783,6765.592,"For example, if the case is not done for four months, we get it back with only two months left in our Timelines.",146,,
1039,0.97,6765.592,6773.867,"I will just go through in big steps, but also we had thoughts about arbitration.",146,,
1040,0.97,6773.867,6784.611,I think we recognize it is an option that every other labor Union has in the city of Seattle.,146,,
1041,0.97,6784.611,6791.151,"But I think there are ways in which arbitration could be improved, so for example, no more review of the chief's decision.",146,,
1042,0.97,6791.151,6801.528,Right now an Arbitrator when they review what the chief decided can look at the record from step one.,146,,
1043,0.97,6801.528,6802.328,Can Re-Create the record.,146,,
1044,0.97,6802.328,6805.532,"So, that is something we think could be discussed.",146,,
1045,0.97,6805.532,6811.604,One thing OPA feel strongly about is mandatory transfers.,146,,
1046,0.97,6811.604,6818.344,We Referenced this in our letter we submitted.,146,,
1047,0.97,6818.344,6820.547,Right now there is not really a system of mandatory transfers.,146,,
1048,0.97,6820.547,6829.255,"For example, you look work in patrol and if you're lucky enough to apply to a specialty unit, you do that.",146,,
1049,0.97,6829.255,6830.056,If you can get in.,146,,
1050,0.97,6830.056,6841.267,"It is very difficult to move out of a specialty unit, so there are officers ending up in patrol for 15 or 20 years and I think they want other opportunities.",146,,
1051,0.97,6841.267,6855.782,"I don't know how you would do it, that is for the experts, but a concept to move people around the city would give patrol officers an opportunity to grow in their careers and more people would stay and want to be with the police Department if that was the case.",146,,
1052,0.97,6855.782,6861.854,One additional thing noted in our letter that we submitted yesterday was we have been focusing a lot on supervisor handling of minor misconduct.,146,,
1053,0.97,6861.854,6869.896,You know in its purest form we believe OPA should focus on serious misconduct.,146,,
1054,0.97,6869.896,6875.001,"Excessive force, violations of law, search and seizure violations.",146,,
1055,0.97,6875.001,6883.176,We do feel it is important to empower supervisors to handle small issues.,146,,
1056,0.97,6883.176,6884.978,"For example, nothing completed or a training being missed.",146,,
1057,0.97,6884.978,6891.017,"When I first started, all of those cases would come to OPA and I think the Department is moving in the right direction.",146,,
1058,0.97,6891.017,6900.894,"There are aspects of that that will have to be bargained with the Union, so we are hopeful that will happen and I think it will be a benefit for OPA and the officers.",146,,
1059,0.97,6900.894,6902.462,There are a number of other issues.,146,,
1060,0.97,6902.462,6906.933,I can address any questions the Council has.,146,,
1061,0.97,6906.933,6907.934,Thank you so much.,147,,
1062,0.97,6907.934,6909.936,"Good morning Madam chair, Council members.",147,,
1063,0.97,6909.936,6917.644,"First, the inspector general expresses her regrets that she couldn't be here today, but thank you for the invitation.",147,,
1064,0.97,6917.644,6920.546,I will briefly summarize the contents of the letter you have before you today.,147,,
1065,0.97,6920.546,6932.859,The inspector general's comments focus around three principles that guide the recommendations and priorities at the office that are being offered to you.,147,,
1066,0.97,6932.859,6933.726,Those are first public trust.,147,,
1067,0.97,6933.726,6937.63,The idea that there needs to be transparency and also clarity.,147,,
1068,0.97,6937.63,6946.873,"So being clear and understandable, so having that be a theme that goes through the review of the SpA agreements.",147,,
1069,0.97,6946.873,6954.747,Part of that includes the capture culture of accountability.,147,,
1070,0.97,6954.747,6963.69,Fostering the right approach and attitude toward effective law enforcement and building that bridge with community.,147,,
1071,0.97,6963.69,6964.257,"Secondly, fair outcomes.",147,,
1072,0.97,6964.257,6968.861,A priority for the inspector general's looking at steps in the contract that affect procedural justice.,147,,
1073,0.97,6968.861,6977.603,"In order to have faith in the outcome, there has to be faith that the process was a good one.",147,,
1074,0.97,6977.603,6979.405,Both perceived as fair for law enforcement and the community.,147,,
1075,0.97,6979.405,6987.113,There are elements and recommendations I will cover that speak to that.,147,,
1076,0.97,6987.113,6989.415,"Thirdly, making sure those provisions continuing to get funds over time.",147,,
1077,0.97,6989.415,7006.799,"So, the inspector general's recommendations, the first has been echoed by the community and the partners at the table and that has been the idea of an external advisor or some sort of neutral advisor presence that can provide transparency to the bargaining process.",147,,
1078,0.97,7006.799,7030.623,"There is also an element in that neutral advisor also, that there is an opportunity for technical advice and there is certainly precedent and opportunity for the oversight entities that the technical advice that the three entities can provide continues to be part of that process.",147,,
1079,0.97,7030.623,7037.463,Both agenda setting as is happening right now and throughout the process as well.,147,,
1080,0.97,7037.463,7040.967,"Particular points related to the contract have been articulated previously, so I will be brief.",147,,
1081,0.97,7040.967,7041.968,The first is subpoena power.,147,,
1082,0.97,7041.968,7053.346,"The inspector general and others including the Council have repeatedly heard in talking to other jurisdictions, the importance of getting data.",147,,
1083,0.97,7053.346,7059.352,So subpoena power is not necessarily in the same way that OPA might need subpoena power.,147,,
1084,0.97,7059.352,7063.956,This is subpoena power for systemic oversight for the auditing function of the office.,147,,
1085,0.97,7063.956,7079.705,"So it is critical for that that the inspector general be able to get information she needs for a fair and effective audit, at the time she needs it.",147,,
1086,0.97,7079.705,7081.24,So you have public mechanisms like public disclosure.,147,,
1087,0.97,7081.24,7089.715,"You have your usual routes of ordination and cooperation, but subpoena power is the final answer in the game.",147,,
1088,0.97,7089.715,7090.716,If things aren't working.,147,,
1089,0.97,7090.716,7104.33,"If you absolutely need something, that authority, that backstop needs to be there to support the authority of the office to make a claim for what it means, outside what is already provided by city laws.",147,,
1090,0.97,7104.33,7105.531,And through the Spog contract.,147,,
1091,0.97,7105.531,7112.905,"Secondly, having all misconduct allegations held to a preponderance of the evidence standard.",147,,
1092,0.97,7112.905,7122.181,"And the Timeline that the director has spoken to, having clarity around what starts that 180 day clock and provisions for Tolling and other aspects related.",147,,
1093,0.97,7122.181,7136.629,"When I talk about procedural fairness, it is if the process is clear, it builds trust that this is a system everyone agreed to.",147,,
1094,0.97,7136.629,7137.864,This is what this step is.,147,,
1095,0.97,7137.864,7140.433,This is what triggers it and then you can have a conversation.,147,,
1096,0.97,7140.433,7142.835,Let's first get what does it mean to start that clock.,147,,
1097,0.97,7142.835,7152.311,"Arbitration is a theme that has Resonated with both oversight, the Mayor and the court as well.",147,,
1098,0.97,7152.311,7154.28,Having public confidence there.,147,,
1099,0.97,7154.28,7156.182,That increases transparency and efficiency of that process.,147,,
1100,0.97,7156.182,7172.498,"Understanding the complexities and the precedents involved in all of that, but recognizing the importance of getting clarity in perceptions of fairness around that as well.",147,,
1101,0.97,7172.498,7178.171,"Finally, civilian sworn investigative staffing is a new concept that has not been raised before, that the IG is highlighting.",147,,
1102,0.97,7178.171,7192.218,That is that in the contract that allows OPA to hire up to two civilian investigators.,147,,
1103,0.97,7192.218,7196.389,"That represents a relatively small proportion of the amount of investigators on staff, so the rest would be sworn officers.",147,,
1104,0.97,7196.389,7201.294,"When the ordinance was passed, the idea was, what is the right mix?",147,,
1105,0.97,7201.294,7201.894,What percentage make sense?,147,,
1106,0.97,7201.894,7205.498,"All civilian, no civilian, some mixed.",147,,
1107,0.97,7205.498,7211.637,"When you start with a limit of two out of 10, you are already constraining the ability to investigate what is the right mix.",147,,
1108,0.97,7211.637,7229.288,"So just encouraging having the freedom within that process to be able to fully explore that question, get to the right answer and when everyone agrees on what the right answer is, not having to go through another round of bargaining for final implementation of what that model might look like.",147,,
1109,0.97,7229.288,7244.87,"I would conclude by saying in terms of strengthening oversight independence, that the inspector general looks forward to working with the city and maintaining the strength with oversight partners and resource staffing and the ability to ensure the system is doing what it is supposed to.",147,,
1110,0.97,7244.87,7252.178,"Thank you and before we move on, I know this is an issue that all three of the oversight bodies flag.",148,,
1111,0.97,7252.178,7280.673,"I do want to flag--I am interested in having an Off- line conversation about arbitration in light of Appendix C in the December 13, 2019, filing that addresses what I perceived as many of the concerns with arbitration.",148,,
1112,0.97,7280.673,7287.079,"With a new, Randomized selection process and identified qualifications.",148,,
1113,0.97,7287.079,7308.834,"I want to make sure that moving into negotiations I have a good understanding of what your ongoing issues are with arbitration, given this new arrangement that has been worked out between Seattle human resources and Spog as it relates to Arbitrators.",148,,
1114,0.97,7308.834,7309.168,Thank you.,148,,
1115,0.97,7309.168,7311.837,Thank you.,149,,
1116,0.97,7311.837,7325.351,"I would like to echo all of what has been said before, especially with the external advisor, accountability experts being part of the bargaining going forth.",149,,
1117,0.97,7325.351,7331.957,"Also, number one here is the burden of proof and standards of review.",149,,
1118,0.97,7331.957,7339.732,We would like for that to return to a use of Preponderant standards for all allegations of misconduct.,149,,
1119,0.97,7339.732,7353.279,Also we have heard a lot about the reforming of the calculation of the 180 day Timeline and I have to reiterate that because it has been clearly articulated by the other speakers.,149,,
1120,0.97,7353.279,7357.583,Also the authority for subpoena power has been there.,149,,
1121,0.97,7357.583,7366.492,"Also, reforming the features of discipline to affect public confidence and what is the standard of review?",149,,
1122,0.97,7366.492,7370.563,The other one that really stands out is the dishonesty.,149,,
1123,0.97,7370.563,7387.012,"To remove requirements that Intentionality must be proven and also, the last part of that is the obligation to be honest should extend to all actions and statements.",149,,
1124,0.97,7387.012,7393.185,"Not only during the interview, but all along.",149,,
1125,0.97,7393.185,7393.619,Let's see here.,149,,
1126,0.97,7393.619,7402.795,To ensure civilian oversight authority includes allocation of criminal misconduct and to make sure that this is there and to continue.,149,,
1127,0.97,7402.795,7408.901,Andrew already talked about the tooling that is necessary there.,149,,
1128,0.97,7408.901,7422.581,Another one also important is that the chief should be empowered to place employees on leave without pay if there is an allegation.,149,,
1129,0.97,7422.581,7425.651,I think that needs to go back into that.,149,,
1130,0.97,7425.651,7427.92,"Also, reform around secondary employment.",149,,
1131,0.97,7427.92,7432.858,That was a problem also.,149,,
1132,0.97,7432.858,7445.371,"Also revising the statute of limitations because sometimes you find out later that the records should have been held longer, especially in police brutality cases and stuff like that.",149,,
1133,0.97,7445.371,7457.316,So I think everything else is pretty much articulated by the two partners.,149,,
1134,0.97,7457.316,7458.184,"Fantastic, thank you all.",150,,
1135,0.97,7458.184,7459.985,Any questions before we move into amendments?,150,,
1136,0.97,7459.985,7460.586,"Yes, thank you.",151,,
1137,0.97,7460.586,7462.021,Thanks everyone for being here today.,151,,
1138,0.97,7462.021,7470.162,"I wanted to clarify, when we approve this resolution, Greg mentioned the letters are being attached.",151,,
1139,0.97,7470.162,7471.43,These are very thoughtful letters.,151,,
1140,0.97,7471.43,7471.697,Thorough.,151,,
1141,0.97,7471.697,7480.272,"I want to clarify that the voting on the resolution is not to vote on the letters, correct?",151,,
1142,0.97,7480.272,7483.509,"That is just sort of a clerk file, not that we are approving the letters.",151,,
1143,0.97,7483.509,7501.627,"I believe the amendment is to attach them to the resolution as an attachment, not that we are approving the letters, but it is a resource that is referred to in the resolution itself as in, see attachment one.",152,,
1144,0.97,7501.627,7503.529,It doesn't mean we are approving the letters.,152,,
1145,0.97,7503.529,7507.9,It is in the whereas statements where they reference the letters.,153,,
1146,0.97,7507.9,7511.237,I think resource is a good way to describe it.,153,,
1147,0.97,7511.237,7512.905,Thank you.,154,,
1148,0.97,7512.905,7517.61,Sometimes we use clerk files if we are passing an ordinance.,155,,
1149,0.97,7517.61,7524.917,"Since this is a resolution, simply including an attachment I think is a cleaner way to have everything be in place.",155,,
1150,0.97,7524.917,7544.27,"With that, I would like to propose amendment one to Council resolution 3190 and this is the amendment--Oh, here, I should make sure you all have copies of these packets.",155,,
1151,0.97,7544.27,7547.94,"Councilmember, may I add one thing to my comments?",156,,

1153,0.97,7556.582,7560.886,You would say the Council is hereby adopting or proving the content of the letters.,156,,
1154,0.97,7560.886,7565.19,So that is why I see it more as a reference or a resource.,156,,
1155,0.97,7565.19,7566.559,Thank you.,157,,
1156,0.97,7566.559,7568.36,So this amendment is a technical change.,157,,
1157,0.97,7568.36,7581.874,"It adds to the whereas statement, the specific citation for the Seattle municipal code provision that is Referenced.",157,,
1158,0.97,7581.874,7587.713,"So on line 2, line 9 after whereas, the amendment is to Delete the word the.",157,,

1220,0.97,7967.192,7973.999,We really appreciate everybody's patients getting through a long agenda.,184,,
1221,0.97,7973.999,7978.236,We can do some introductions.,184,,
1222,0.97,7978.236,7983.642,"Aly Pennucci, central staff.",185,,
1223,0.97,7983.642,7984.409,"Amy Gore, central staff.",186,,
1224,0.97,7984.409,8023.515,"Thank you, I have asked central staff because of concerns we've been hearing from the community about the pace of the executive's implementation of Council budget priorities enacted in the November Council vote and I have asked that we, as a counsel, consider that our expectations for those budget adds be tempered by an Nderstanding of whether these are expansions of existing contracts or development of new programs.",187,,
1225,0.97,8023.515,8035.761,So central staff have worked with the human services Department on getting some clarity on which items the executive feels are extensions of existing contracts.,187,,
1226,0.97,8035.761,8060.886,"Which items might be services agencies already provide, but we are considering whether or not to go out for a new Rfp and which items actually require some program development, because we are contemplating finding a service that is not currently funded at all.",187,,
1227,0.97,8060.886,8071.196,"So, Amy and Aly have put together a summary that I think can inform our expectations.",187,,
1228,0.97,8071.196,8091.116,"I will clarify these are only--these are all of the human services Department ads that do not include the homelessness services adds in last year's budget deliberations, of which there are many.",187,,
1229,0.97,8091.116,8095.787,But that falls into the Bailiwick of the select Committee on homelessness.,187,,
1230,0.97,8095.787,8097.022,So with that I turn it over.,187,,
1231,0.97,8097.022,8098.523,"Great, thank you.",188,,
1232,0.97,8098.523,8107.833,"As you mentioned, Aly and I are here to give a brief update on the status of Council additions to the 2020 budget.",188,,
1233,0.97,8107.833,8118.51,"Last fall, council approved several changes including youth development, health education, law enforcement assisted diversion and homelessness services.",188,,
1234,0.97,8118.51,8120.645,"As you mentioned, this memo does not reflect homelessness.",188,,
1235,0.97,8120.645,8129.121,"Last week, central staff met to discuss the status of executing contracts with providers to fund priorities in the 2020 budget.",188,,
1236,0.97,8129.121,8133.558,In general they fall into four categories.,188,,
1237,0.97,8133.558,8138.663,First would be an addition to an existing contract.,188,,
1238,0.97,8138.663,8145.604,This is when Hst already has a contract with an appropriate service provider and can add a new or expanded program to that contract.,188,,
1239,0.97,8145.604,8149.374,The goal is to be completed by January 31 of this year.,188,,
1240,0.97,8149.374,8158.683,"Contracts include $124,000 for sex industry worker diversion programming.",188,,
1241,0.97,8158.683,8170.428,"$10,000 for transportation and activities for seniors and $15,000 for educational health programs targeted to the African-American Ds Bora.",188,,
1242,0.97,8170.428,8175.167,The second category would be new Sole-Source contracts.,188,,
1243,0.97,8175.167,8186.278,"This is when it is appropriate to use a single contract, rather than competitive bidding.",188,,
1244,0.97,8186.278,8188.413,"The goal is to have these completed by February 29, 2020.",188,,
1245,0.97,8188.413,8194.085,"It includes $140,000 for the harm reduction program for Street-Based sex workers.",188,,
1246,0.97,8194.085,8198.156,"Third, we have no, Sole-Source contracts that include capital cost.",188,,
1247,0.97,8198.156,8203.695,"For example, building a health clinic.",188,,
1248,0.97,8203.695,8206.298,Contracts of capital cost of additional considerations and require further legal review.,188,,
1249,0.97,8206.298,8220.245,"Hsd indicated they will take longer than the Sole-Source contracts they were trying to get done by the end of February, but did not have an exact Timeline at the end of our meeting last week.",188,,
1250,0.97,8220.245,8222.414,That would include the 1.8 million to construct a health clinic.,188,,
1251,0.97,8222.414,8229.821,"Finally, there were three different programs that were involved in ongoing discussions.",188,,
1252,0.97,8229.821,8242.634,"Hsd indicated they were Deliberating about these ads to determine the appropriate contracting approach, Sole- source or an Rfp, or the scope of work that will be funded.",188,,
1253,0.97,8242.634,8246.271,This work includes outreach to relevant organizations and input from the Mayor's office.,188,,
1254,0.97,8246.271,8259.684,"Hst did not have a specific Timeline for these contracts and this category included $522,000 for youth diversion, community building and education programs.",188,,
1255,0.97,8259.684,8268.593,"$3.5 million for law enforcement assisted diversion and $755,000 for food access and nutrition programs.",188,,
1256,0.97,8268.593,8275.9,We will be meeting again with Hst staff soon to get another update and hopefully get clarity on the expected Timelines in these ongoing discussion category.,188,,
1257,0.97,8275.9,8304.129,"On those two items, the $300,000 for one time general fund for youth diversion, community building and education programs and the $222,000 for similar objectives, I remember there was a great deal of discussion during the budget process about the need to provide this funding, because it could be used to immediately augment existing contracts.",189,,
1258,0.97,8304.129,8338.73,"I appointed to the $1.3 million in funding and new dollars that the Council provided in 2018 for--we voted in 2018 to allocate in 2020, $1.3 million in youth diversion funds that was going to be the dispersion of those funds, driven by Community- based process, that the office of civil rights was engaged in.",189,,
1259,0.97,8338.73,8350.475,"And we have a Timeline for that and the funding is, for the most part, on track with what we were told in the budget process.",189,,
1260,0.97,8350.475,8385.71,"But the need for these funds, that are in Hsd's budget, it was described that they would be allocated more quickly with more urgency if we provided that funding to Hsd, then if we waited for the community driven grant process that Soc R was leading for the anticipated 2020 funding for a very similar program.",189,,
1261,0.97,8385.71,8415.54,"So it sounds to me though that what was anticipated to happen with these funds and them getting out the door very quickly is not likely, based on the fact that even though it is identified as an existing contract, there are no additional details about the expected timing in 2020 and the only information we have is ongoing discussion.",189,,
1262,0.97,8415.54,8422.614,"Right, and I don't know if we can make a claim about how quickly it will go.",190,,
1263,0.97,8422.614,8427.452,Hst was not ready to commit to the January or February deadline at our meeting last week.,190,,
1264,0.97,8427.452,8436.995,"It did not, when we were discussing them, sound quite as complicated as some of the other long-term contracts, but we can follow up with them, absolutely.",190,,
1265,0.97,8436.995,8448.373,"I think following up--I mean, we know what some of the services that the Council was anticipating would be provided with these funds.",191,,
1266,0.97,8448.373,8455.68,It would be helpful to ensure that the conversations are happening with the providers of those services.,191,,
1267,0.97,8455.68,8475.066,"And I would ask, again, given the councils expectation for this funding, it would be great to press a little bit on what we anticipate for expected timing.",191,,
1268,0.97,8475.066,8492.884,"I think in conversations with the Department, as well as reviewing the funding process manual that sort of lays out best circumstances the expected way that they sort of manage different budget changes and that sort of thing.",192,,
1269,0.97,8492.884,8499.19,I think one of the things pointed out in that guideline as they develop a funding process guideline.,192,,
1270,0.97,8499.19,8511.336,So that is one of the asks for the Department for those contracts that we don't expect to see or they are not committing to get out the door in January or February.,192,,
1271,0.97,8511.336,8515.607,Can we see that Timeline and understand where the questions are?,192,,
1272,0.97,8515.607,8539.697,"I think the conversation fluctuated between an urgency of funding and also that the $1.3 million added previously by the Council was, you know, in the whole community driven process, and all of those things was important, but not sufficient for all of those programs so it was both an urgency and we need still more than that.",192,,
1273,0.97,8539.697,8557.482,"My understanding is they are wanting to talk to those organizations they were named specifically in the budget, to understand their expectations in terms of the distribution of the funding between the organizations and those types of things, so we will push a little bit and try to get more detailed information for the committee.",192,,
1274,0.97,8557.482,8573.531,"It would be helpful to understand why they are identified as new, as opposed to existing, because I was under the impression that some of these organizations that provide the services we are interested in providing do have current contracts with the city.",193,,
1275,0.97,8573.531,8588.88,"I think at least one I know of has a contract with the city, but it is through DOM and some of them have been previously funded, but I am not aware of any current contract he's with Hst specifically.",194,,
1276,0.97,8588.88,8595.486,So it is not which organization --,195,,
1277,0.97,8595.486,8599.924,"That was my understanding, but we can double check everything.",196,,
1278,0.97,8599.924,8603.628,All right.,197,,
1279,0.97,8603.628,8624.549,I do have a question about the Osc sweetened beverage tax budget action for Micro grants to include fresh food options.,197,,
1280,0.97,8624.549,8634.859,"These are termed existing contracts, which implies contracting should be completed by January 31, yet both are listed as in ongoing discussion, with no further details.",197,,
1281,0.97,8634.859,8636.227,Do we have any additional information?,197,,
1282,0.97,8636.227,8652.877,"Sure, these are most likely either going to be proportional additions to existing contracts, or they will go through some process to choose one or more existing contracts.",198,,
1283,0.97,8652.877,8662.887,"I think they just haven't made that decision yet, whether it will be proportionally distributed or if certain contracts will be selected for a larger portion of those funds.",198,,
1284,0.97,8662.887,8678.569,"Okay, but no feeling that we will be able to make those decisions by an expected Timeline?",199,,
1285,0.97,8678.569,8682.607,"Not yet, no.",200,,
1286,0.97,8682.607,8683.474,All right.,201,,
1287,0.97,8683.474,8685.81,While I appreciate you putting this information together.,201,,
1288,0.97,8685.81,8693.117,It allows us to follow-up on what we know and don't know.,201,,
1289,0.97,8693.117,8717.542,"One of the items in the letter I wanted to put a fine point on, similar issue as I mentioned before, something that is identified as an existing contract, but yet listed in the chart is an ongoing discussion without a lot of details and that is the Council's intent to expand the lead program.",201,,
1290,0.97,8717.542,8732.056,I think there has been a lot of anxiety in the public around the timing for the expansion of the program.,201,,
1291,0.97,8732.056,8733.825,Lead has a very good outcome.,201,,
1292,0.97,8733.825,8747.638,Around Recidivism and other performance measures.,201,,
1293,0.97,8747.638,8750.274,There is ongoing discussion about further developing those reporting measures.,201,,
1294,0.97,8750.274,8764.188,There is nothing to suggest that they are not meeting and exceeding the reporting measures that we are currently requiring.,201,,
1295,0.97,8764.188,8771.796,The ongoing reporting on.,201,,
1296,0.97,8771.796,8792.483,"I know my colleagues have expressed concern, because some of this expansion last year for the program is to expand into the geographic areas that many of us on the Council represent.",201,,
1297,0.97,8792.483,8812.403,"The Council allocated an additional $3.5 million to fully fund the program helping address some of our most difficult challenges and to ensure that our city's most vulnerable citizens can avoid the revolving door criminal justice system, which we heard a lot from the public about this morning, when appropriate and possible, while also improving public safety outcomes.",201,,
1298,0.97,8812.403,8822.547,"Right now, lead has reserved referrals for 300 individuals who they are unable to serve due to a lack of resources.",201,,
1299,0.97,8822.547,8828.653,"They are also unable to take new referrals, a key component of this program.",201,,
1300,0.97,8828.653,8837.061,"There is every reason to believe that the true need is much greater, which is why the Council added additional resources.",201,,
1301,0.97,8837.061,8843.634,The backlog comprises what is known as social contacts.,201,,
1302,0.97,8843.634,8865.99,"The lead program has a Prioritization process and social contact referrals, which again are what the backlog are composed of, are individuals who officers have reason to believe commit crimes due to behavioral health or poverty, but they may not have probable cause to make an arrest frayed the vertebral crime at the moment.",201,,
1303,0.97,8865.99,8871.696,But that son social contact referrals can give an alternative to refer them to Úlead.,201,,
1304,0.97,8871.696,8900.925,"They try hard to Prioritize social contact referrals from business improvement areas in our city, because again, lead is a public safety program that exists to Prioritize responding to emerging public safety and disorder issues identified by the communities where we live and work.",201,,
1305,0.97,8900.925,8907.632,The concern that I think we all share about the current proposal of funding.,201,,
1306,0.97,8907.632,8929.42,"The current caseload and backlog is that it makes it impossible for them to really take high- priority arrest referrals and they cannot operate as a program, without being able again, the backlog is largely social contact referrals.",201,,
1307,0.97,8929.42,8936.861,It has been De-Prioritized because of the higher need to take the higher priority arrest referrals.,201,,
1308,0.97,8936.861,8944.635,"That, again, is part of our interest and desire to expand this program geographically.",201,,
1309,0.97,8944.635,8956.58,So where I appreciate the correspondence we received from the Mayor's office yesterday and I appreciate the clarity of where they are right now.,201,,
1310,0.97,8956.58,8964.889,I want to share with Councilmembers a letter that I would like us to send.,201,,
1311,0.97,8964.889,8977.301,I am distributing it in my committee because this is a letter from my committee and because we have open public meeting issues.,201,,
1312,0.97,8977.301,8980.204,We have to sign it in open session.,201,,
1313,0.97,8980.204,8987.378,So this letter has four objectives.,201,,
1314,0.97,8987.378,9000.891,One is to confirm the Mayor's commitment that the city intends to provide program funding in 2020 that includes the councils additional $3.5 million investment.,201,,
1315,0.97,9000.891,9016.307,"The purpose is to execute a contract for the additional funds by March 1 of this year, with provision of performance data to be collected that may be modified by mutual agreement by the end of the year.",201,,
1316,0.97,9016.307,9042.032,"To affirm that lead is a public safety program and not a homelessness intervention program and for ongoing information I appreciate the opportunity I have had to speak directly with the Mayor on this, as well as the deputy Mayor, but there is still a need to get a better understanding of some of the conversations between the human services Department and so the letter itself contains questions we would like some answers to.",201,,
1317,0.97,9042.032,9053.677,"And then also I just want to pass around to complete the packet, the attachments that will accompany the letter.",201,,
1318,0.97,9053.677,9054.945,Thank you.,202,,
1319,0.97,9054.945,9060.785,"Greg, did I Miss anything that is important to mention here?",203,,
1320,0.97,9060.785,9086.61,"You seldom Miss anything, but I might mention one nuance that is in addition to the backlog, the 300 individuals waiting to be accepted into the lead program, there is one other issue and that is as the program expanded last year, into Soto and North Precinct, they stretched too far and now each cast case manager has 45 cases.",204,,
1321,0.97,9086.61,9091.682,It is not just the new money allowing the city to address the backlog.,204,,
1322,0.97,9091.682,9109.733,"It would also allow the program to right size their case manager client load and if that didn't happen, they would actually have to go backwards.",204,,
1323,0.97,9109.733,9111.802,"They would have to reduce their cases, they believed by 46%.",204,,
1324,0.97,9111.802,9113.237,And you may have said that --,204,,
1325,0.97,9113.237,9115.84,"I did not say it, so it is very helpful, thank you.",205,,
1326,0.97,9115.84,9117.441,Are there other questions?,205,,
1327,0.97,9117.441,9117.975,Councilmember Pedersen.,205,,
1328,0.97,9117.975,9156.881,"Thank you for putting together this letter to the Mayor's office and in reading the letter I agree with what you have here, I just want to state that my interpretation of the letter is there is still--you know, I appreciate the hard work done by previous Council and the Mayor's office to make sure human services Department sticks with Performance-Based contracts and I don't see anything inconsistent with that in the letter, so I appreciate that commitment to Performance- based contracts.",206,,
1329,0.97,9156.881,9166.59,I know there are challenges with collecting the outcome data on Recidivism.,206,,
1330,0.97,9166.59,9181.172,"We obviously want to see that, the success of lead, continue with the outcomes and it is challenging sometimes to collect that data, but I am hopeful that lead and Hst will work out where to get that data, so thank you for putting that together.",206,,
1331,0.97,9181.172,9185.276,"I am optimistic, too, and working to make sure we are part of the conversation moving forward.",207,,
1332,0.97,9185.276,9186.076,Thank you.,207,,
1333,0.97,9186.076,9192.917,"With that, I will pass the letter for signing.",207,,
1334,0.97,9192.917,9199.924,"And I will filibuster here for a minute, while all of the signatures get added to, so we are truly in open session.",207,,
1335,0.97,9199.924,9218.275,"But with that I would like to thank the work that central staff is done on the overall funding issue and in particular the work that Greg Doss has done this week on two of our hot issues on the committee agenda today, so thank you so much.",207,,
1336,0.97,9218.275,9225.549,"With that it is 12:0 7 PM and if there is no other business to come before the committee, we are adjourned.",207,,
1337,0.97,9225.549,9233.257,"Thanks, everybody.",208,,
