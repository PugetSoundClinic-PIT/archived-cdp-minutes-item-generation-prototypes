27,0.97,114.414,118.918,I want to recognize we have three slides left over from this morning's presentation.,18,,
28,0.97,118.918,125.658,Thank you for carrying over these three slides as they lead into this item on our agenda.,18,,
29,0.97,125.658,133.566,Today's item includes a presentation from a handful of departments under the umbrella of community safety.,18,,
30,0.97,133.566,147.514,"I want to welcome senior deputy Mayor from the Mayor's office, Jason Johnson and from human services Department, and director noble from the city budgets office.",18,,
31,0.97,147.514,153.653,We have a handful of other participants from different departments and the Mayor's executive team as well.,18,,
32,0.97,153.653,160.994,"As we get to various presentations, if I did not call your name, please do let us know you're here and introduce yourself for the record.",18,,
33,0.97,160.994,179.312,"Senior deputy Mayor, I think I will turn it over to you first and then we will turn it back to the slide show presentation.",19,,
34,0.97,179.312,179.612,Welcome.,19,,
35,0.97,179.612,180.647,Thank you.,20,,
36,0.97,180.647,181.948,And good afternoon Council members.,20,,
37,0.97,181.948,205.305,I appreciate to share some thoughts on threading together our efforts on community safety and I had the opportunity to listen to most of your discussion this morning on SPD I wanted to mention that I actually feel that there is a fair amount of alignment on the number of major areas of focus.,20,,
38,0.97,205.305,238.771,"While we may have some policy differences and some operational and Implementtations into the budget process, overall, I think we're talking about the same framework with elements that are really in X trick BLY Linkinged to each other and we'll have a chance to walk through some of that in detail in our presentation, but just a preview the Mayor's executive order from this morning is a continuation really of some Foundational work we already initiated over the last several months.",20,,
39,0.97,238.771,245.311,I focused in on the efforts from the deep dive into s P.D.,20,,
40,0.97,245.311,250.483,You all had some healthy dialogue with chief Diaz and his team this morning.,20,,
41,0.97,250.483,279.912,And in terms of the fundamental reform elements that we are looking at with regard to the police Department and I want to echo what Council President Gonzalez talked about extensively this morning which is the fundamentally we're talking about the bodies of work and functions that have been core and to what extent that we're open to shifting those bodies of work outside the Department.,20,,
42,0.97,279.912,296.062,"And I would say that the initial proposals from the Mayor, many of which were consistent with some of your earlier dialogue this summer, this additional $60 million effort of reduction and functions being Trans firmed ot of the Department is that.",20,,
43,0.97,296.062,301.367,They look at shifting and reshaping some of the core functions and responsibilities of the SPD.,20,,
44,0.97,301.367,305.605,We'll have an opportunity to talk about those functions in a little more detail here in a moment.,20,,
45,0.97,305.605,313.68,You have some of that preview this morning when we walked through some of the budget transfer components.,20,,
46,0.97,313.68,337.804,The second piece of puzzle that we all have talked extensively about and have multiple efforts initiated is around centering our efforts around community and engaging community and letting community lead around Trans Dem Mick transformation and at the Prgramatic level.,20,,
47,0.97,337.804,345.144,Our hope is that the Ecosystem that we built around this work going forward will have community engagement centered in that process.,20,,
48,0.97,345.144,361.294,We look forward to working with all of you around the parties PA Torey budget you identified and Tia will talk about our thinking around engagement and there is an opportunity to bring us further into alignment in that conversation.,20,,
49,0.97,361.294,370.937,The third Prong I think of all of this in these three Consec trick circle is is investment.,20,,
50,0.97,370.937,372.572,Investment allocation of resources.,20,,
51,0.97,372.572,374.54,I don't think those are just financial in nature.,20,,
52,0.97,374.54,387.32,"They include Organizationnal, staffing, other city aspects and you'll hear a little about some of the structural elements we're thinking about through director Johnston Hsd framework.",20,,
53,0.97,387.32,411.744,"Of course separately we have all for some time have had parallel and concurrent efforts related to the legal system reform, whether around the jail, youth retention, alternatives Incarceration, all of those are moving in parallel in concert to the system we built around these core areas of community investment and SPD deep dive.",20,,
54,0.97,411.744,428.194,"So I hope that the discussion this afternoon, which is still an evolving one, as we Buildout the clear elements that we want to be focused in on, how they connect with each other, and we welcome the Council's engagement in that process as well.",20,,
55,0.97,428.194,438.905,"Just this morning, I reinforced our invitation to the Council and Council central staff to participate with us in the working group and I Dt process.",20,,
56,0.97,438.905,449.115,We have had some success in those kinds of collaborative models before and I look forward to looking with them going forward with this process as well.,20,,
57,0.97,449.115,458.257,One thing I want to emphasize is that to be clear and I think is is entirely consistent with much of what the Council talked about as well.,21,,
58,0.97,458.257,476.742,"I think the Mayor believes while we go through this process, we want to make sure we're not compromising our existing response, not to 911 calls as well as public safety in in general.",21,,
59,0.97,476.742,494.06,That is con cities consistent with the $14 million safety . It is a recognition there is the need to build capacity in order to move towards transition.,21,,
60,0.97,494.06,509.575,I think that Foundational work will take time and we're prepared to do that but we hope we can have a meaningful discussion around the process and the implementation and the framework of how we get to that future state.,21,,
61,0.97,509.575,515.314,With that we'll walk through several components this afternoon and turn it over to our power point here.,21,,
62,0.97,515.314,548.014,"I think some of the initial slides and I missed the last part of the discussion this morning, so I know there was a little carry forward but I think Julie Klein was going to kick us off on a few of the elements related to the functions that were Transitioning from the police Department and speak to that a little bit more as we launch into the E0 and the other components of community safety work.",21,,
63,0.97,548.014,548.414,Thank you.,22,,
64,0.97,548.414,550.082,Will you be with is?,22,,
65,0.97,550.082,550.95,I'll be here.,23,,
66,0.97,550.95,563.629,Before we move into those three slides and Julie thank you for being with us for this presentation.,23,,
67,0.97,563.629,566.933,Are there any questions for his opening remarks?,23,,
68,0.97,566.933,568.067,I'm seeing none.,24,,
69,0.97,568.067,581.847,"I have some, but I will hold those specific questions related to your remarks as well regarding the $14 million until we get through the first few slides.",24,,
70,0.97,581.847,586.052,"Thank you, Julie for waiting.",24,,
71,0.97,586.052,587.086,Absolutely.,25,,
72,0.97,587.086,587.453,Good afternoon.,25,,
73,0.97,587.453,593.159,"Julie Klein, Mayor's public safety advisor from the executive's office.",25,,
74,0.97,593.159,594.46,And let's see.,25,,
75,0.97,594.46,595.695,"Brian, if you want to advise one.",25,,
76,0.97,595.695,597.096,There we go.,25,,
77,0.97,597.096,607.073,"The functional transfers, this is essentially a Recap of what we talked about this morning and Council members seemed well versed in the functional transfers that were made.",25,,
78,0.97,607.073,614.68,I hope I was able to answer any questions about the policy decisions behind these transfers.,25,,
79,0.97,614.68,631.197,Just to name--I won't go into the details again add Naus see Yum but to Recap the parking enforcement officers for the 2021 budget moved over to the Department of transportation from the Seattle police Department.,25,,
80,0.97,631.197,638.17,The Office of emergency management that was functioning also moved out from under the Seattle police Department.,25,,
81,0.97,638.17,648.014,"The director of emergency management has been acting as a cabinet level position for some time now, for the last two administrations or three potentially.",25,,
82,0.97,648.014,660.593,"The 911 communications center, we moved that out from under the Seattle police Department as well creating an independent en Te Ty called the Seattle communications center.",25,,
83,0.97,660.593,669.035,We hope this is a first step to Civillion Nize 911 responses and diversify the 911 responses.,25,,
84,0.97,669.035,679.311,"Potentially, depending on where the community engagement takes us and consensus takes us, we can explore the idea of citywide communication center as well that includes both emergency and noon emergency.",25,,
85,0.97,679.311,682.448,We felt that was a step in the right direction.,25,,
86,0.97,682.448,702.768,Then finally the victim advocacy team that was done IP affect by the Council's budget moves and the 2021 Mayor's budget makes permanent that transfer of the advocacy team to the division newly arranged in Hsd.,25,,
87,0.97,702.768,707.84,I'll let director Johnson fill everyone in a little more on that.,25,,
88,0.97,707.84,725.091,So were there any questions of regarding any of these budget transfers that I wasn't able to answer this morning or that may have come up this morning that we haven't answered those?,25,,
89,0.97,725.091,744.543,"This next slide here, again, Recaps the monetary changes in the actual budget numbers and FTE's that have been transferred out moving to civilization of responses, so --",26,,
90,0.97,744.543,748.247,"Council member, do you have a question?",27,,
91,0.97,748.247,749.648,You're so good.,28,,
92,0.97,749.648,753.853,You see when I take my Mic.,28,,
93,0.97,753.853,755.621,Off mute.,28,,
94,0.97,755.621,756.055,I appreciate it.,28,,
95,0.97,756.055,771.804,Just--I see some indication about some changes related to overtime but I haven't seen a picture of how much in total over time is budgeted for SPD in the proposed 2021 budget.,28,,
96,0.97,771.804,782.081,That would be a better question for either Cara mean Hester who I don't believe is on or Angela Sochi who es know it on.,29,,
97,0.97,782.081,784.383,We'll get you that information.,29,,
98,0.97,784.383,785.451,Thank you.,30,,
99,0.97,785.451,787.186,I appreciate it.,30,,
100,0.97,787.186,810.743,"I want to also flag the fact there are several pending questions that I have related to overtime policies, and I think some of them dovetail into special events, as well and these are contained in a letter I sent to chief Diaz on September 17th.",30,,
101,0.97,810.743,831.397,And I have not yet received a response to those inquiries around over time policies and the significant concerns that I have about the lack of over time controls as well as the lack of progress on not just implementing the Rep.,30,,
102,0.97,831.397,858.791,"Read days from the auditor's report because I don't think even though those issues are framed as if they are wholly issues that can be resolved with technology, there are some manual things that can be done to improve over time controls in the interim that I certainly hope the police Deartment has been doing, but I don't know if they have.",30,,
103,0.97,858.791,914.88,"Then there is of course the issue of not just over time controls but off duty time and the lack of--I can't say that there has not been progress but I am not aware of any progress to the Mayor Burgess' executive order on September 13th, 2017 related specifically to off duty work and then Finally, chief Diaz said that by Redeploying officers 100 officers from specialty units to patrol will reduce over time and in this letter from the 17th I requested an effort of the over time reduction that will result from this redeployment or even just a projection.",30,,
104,0.97,914.88,952.751,"If somebody else I should send this letter to, I am happy to do so, but I think these are really pressing issues, not just as it relates to insuring that taxpayer dollars are being spent in a way that are, you know, consistent with overtime practices and limitations on the number of hours that officers should be working, this whole issue of people getting paid for more than 24 hours in a day is one that I think is really be Fudd LING and troubling to a lot of people so thank you.",30,,
105,0.97,952.751,954.286,Yes.,31,,
106,0.97,954.286,958.924,"Council member Herbal, I don't know if mark Barrett is on the line.",31,,
107,0.97,958.924,966.565,I'm hopeful he may be able to Expound on that but the staffing changes will have an impact on over time.,31,,
108,0.97,966.565,968.267,There is a new computer program also.,31,,
109,0.97,968.267,968.467,Wst.,31,,
110,0.97,968.467,978.243,"I can't remember what that stands for that is going to be helping to better track over tame as well, so I know those two things are in play.",31,,
111,0.97,978.243,986.318,I know this was a very specific from the Mayor and we really drilled down and examined that.,31,,
112,0.97,986.318,994.026,That sounds like it is a shared interest between you and the Mayor and something that is certainly on our agenda.,31,,
113,0.97,994.026,995.494,Yes.,32,,
114,0.97,995.494,999.665,I just want to underscore the technology is still a long ways away.,32,,
115,0.97,999.665,1016.448,We have questions about the use of over time that need to be answered now and there are things that SPD could do manually to get some of these answers.,32,,
116,0.97,1016.448,1016.749,Thank you.,32,,
117,0.97,1016.749,1018.15,Thank you very much.,33,,
118,0.97,1018.15,1019.284,For our I.T.,33,,
119,0.97,1019.284,1022.254,Team can you please mute the clerk's line.,33,,
120,0.97,1022.254,1030.362,There is a little background noise there.,33,,
121,0.97,1030.362,1033.298,Thank you for doing that.,33,,
122,0.97,1033.298,1034.9,Are there additional questions on the slide?,34,,
123,0.97,1034.9,1036.135,Please continue.,35,,
124,0.97,1036.135,1044.176,Did you want to give a brief overview of the E0 or do you want me to jump into the Knits and bolts of it?,36,,
125,0.97,1044.176,1076.875,"Julie, why don't eye go into the nuts and bolts and I'll overlay as we go and we have a number of members on the team that can speak to some of the specifics as well, but I think this discussion starred in earnest this morning and Julie can provide a little more texture to some of the things we contemplated in the what is effectively amounting to two work groups, community safety work group and functional analysis focused in on SPD.",37,,
126,0.97,1076.875,1080.012,Why don't you walk us through it's Julyly.,37,,
127,0.97,1080.012,1118.15,"I apologize if we didn't get to it this morning, but essentially what this executive order does is designed to help Reimagine policing and community safety in Seattle a it creates an outlines a Timeline, an accountable Timeline to expect analysis on Spd911 dispatch, call volume, expenditures related to those functions, staffing models discussing and analyzing new ways of staffing and personnel deployment.",38,,
128,0.97,1118.15,1125.691,And our intent is to make sure that all of this analysis and all of this data is made publicly available.,38,,
129,0.97,1125.691,1141.54,We understand there are a lot of different public engagement processes going on and we want to make sure that everyone has access to this data and analysis that we intend to do in regards to SPD staffing.,38,,
130,0.97,1141.54,1145.01,And as it relates back to their functions.,38,,
131,0.97,1145.01,1172.404,"What we are intending to do is to review and identify SPD functions that could be transferred, eliminated, reduced, civil Nized or potentially in some cases expanded, what immediately comes to mind is Csos and to develop or identify areas where unarmed civil yen responses replace those police functions.",38,,
132,0.97,1172.404,1175.874,"The I D t, the functional analysis I.D.",38,,
133,0.97,1175.874,1196.228,"T is the laboring or in analyzing the data, making it available tonight work group which will be headed up by the Hsd director Jason Johnson, Department of neighborhoods, director, Andres ""Madea"" and O.C.",38,,
134,0.97,1196.228,1204.57,"R, director Marco Lockhart, and also the interim chief Diaz will be involved in that as well.",38,,
135,0.97,1204.57,1219.284,And that will be sort of more of a Coalescing policy body that will help to sort of make decisions based on the analysis and data collected and made public by the functional analysis I.D.,38,,
136,0.97,1219.284,1232.798,T. one of the other primary things we're hoping the functional analysis will do is help us get community consensus and see what the functional priorities are of the community.,38,,
137,0.97,1232.798,1250.315,"What does the community want to see SPD still doing and in essence a bit of a ranking so you can Operationalize that through various policing models and staffing decisions, air go budget decisions.",38,,
138,0.97,1250.315,1271.336,"Once that occurs and we're hoping it is an Interrative process based on our understanding of the requests for information analysis maybe coming from multiple sources, including the community safety work group and Council and putting that together to help inform policy development and a state legislative agenda.",38,,
139,0.97,1271.336,1274.94,We can talk about that a little more.,38,,
140,0.97,1274.94,1277.142,We have a separate slide on that.,38,,
141,0.97,1277.142,1289.121,"The Mayor has additional ideas what the state policy agenda or what the state legislative agenda should be, but it is no means to be an exhaustive list.",38,,
142,0.97,1289.121,1313.211,"At that point, I think once there is the idea Yation phase has finished we need to start building capacity and community based responses to substitute in for those SPD fences and implement those new models of community safety and that we'll have to have in some cases in conjunction with the advocating for the state law change.",39,,
143,0.97,1313.211,1331.863,"While this is sort of displayed in a circle in this sort of order that we think these changes need to happen, we do envision this being an Interrative process and not a one-way circle.",39,,
144,0.97,1331.863,1334.366,Those are the high points.,39,,
145,0.97,1334.366,1340.906,Anything you want to add deputy Mayor for an overview of the E0?,39,,
146,0.97,1340.906,1341.173,Yes.,40,,
147,0.97,1341.173,1341.606,No.,40,,
148,0.97,1341.606,1341.94,Thanks Julie.,40,,
149,0.97,1341.94,1346.311,You did a great job summarizing some of the key elements.,40,,
150,0.97,1346.311,1370.368,"The only thing I might emphasize and you touched on this already, while this visual suggests some level of sequential movement flew these COMPO Thes a lot of these pieces are going to be in flight concurrently.",40,,
151,0.97,1370.368,1396.661,"For instance, community engagement will flow throughout this process, but also community capacity building as I talked about earlier, given some of the Council's direction and what you'll hear from Johnson later, will get initiated sooner rather than later so while we show this as almost Asieh when Shul move around the horn if you will here a lot of these actions will be moving in parallel.",40,,
152,0.97,1396.661,1397.863,Is that fair Julie?,40,,
153,0.97,1397.863,1400.499,That is absolutely fair.,41,,
154,0.97,1400.499,1407.105,The investment will continue as we shift functions away from police alternatives.,41,,
155,0.97,1407.105,1412.244,Those will happen at different speeds depending what we're talking about.,41,,
156,0.97,1412.244,1445.977,And I know that there is discuss later on about the 100 million in investments and I think the primary reason for that is that the Mayor new that investments couldn't wait for divestment to happen and so actual divestment we think will be happening to some extent in the verbal Lansing the 20201 verbal Lansing depending on the results of our analysis and engagement and probably further reflected and more fully reflected in it in the 2022 budget.,41,,
157,0.97,1445.977,1458.623,We have a Timeline slide coming up to let everyone know what that sort of Timeline.,41,,
158,0.97,1458.623,1458.924,Here it is.,41,,
159,0.97,1458.924,1460.325,The milestones Slag here.,41,,
160,0.97,1460.325,1478.577,"So this demonstrates nicely, visually the sort of where we are in the process and when we're hope to get things stood up and moving, so we're currently in the 20201 city council budget process as of this week.",41,,
161,0.97,1478.577,1488.954,And so you can see the concept of when we're going to be able to get all these things moving.,41,,
162,0.97,1488.954,1494.559,We need to do community engagement around SP functional changes and 911 transformation.,41,,
163,0.97,1494.559,1498.964,The community safety work group and the SPD functional analysis I.D.,41,,
164,0.97,1498.964,1521.086,"T, need to set their work plans and the budget allocations are they're going to necessarily have to be some changes there for us to do some of the work we are envisioning.",41,,
165,0.97,1521.086,1534.299,We are trying hard not to get ahead in making policy decisions or major changes without first understanding what community is Prioritizing functionally speaking in SPD before we start.,41,,
166,0.97,1534.299,1541.006,And then letting our budget decisions flow from that.,41,,
167,0.97,1541.006,1557.322,As you can see this contemplates supplemental 2021 budget process where we fully anticipate . We may be ready to make some budget changes to SPD based on functional changes.,41,,
168,0.97,1557.322,1569.301,"But as we indicated, the full extent of those may not be ready to be stood up and for those functions to be removed from SPD until we are at this time next year.",41,,
169,0.97,1569.301,1583.648,But since those are going to happen in different speeds we didn't want to tie ourselves necessarily to waiting until everything was ready to effect the changes we're looking at.,41,,
170,0.97,1583.648,1584.049,Thank you.,42,,
171,0.97,1584.049,1587.218,I think there are number of questions on this slide in the previous slide.,42,,
172,0.97,1587.218,1593.858,"Councilmembers, I have Councilmember Herbold, and I believe Councilmember Morales.",42,,
173,0.97,1593.858,1598.129,If you had a question I didn't want to Miss you.,42,,
174,0.97,1598.129,1599.731,Councilmember Herbold please go ahead.,42,,
175,0.97,1599.731,1600.732,Thank you so much.,43,,
176,0.97,1600.732,1615.981,"I really appreciate that on the previous slide as well as the slide for each stage the top bullet is community engagement, and very unclear, though, on how that would work.",43,,
177,0.97,1615.981,1624.556,With the community outreach and engagement is in the mechanism for that engagement for each of these steps.,43,,
178,0.97,1624.556,1634.899,I of course appreciate receiving senior deputy Mayor Michael Fong's invitation to the Idt.,43,,
179,0.97,1634.899,1645.677,"I do not believe that is an external body and unless I am mistaken, I don't believe that that body is intending to Reprt out to the public.",43,,
180,0.97,1645.677,1646.611,But maybe it is.,43,,
181,0.97,1646.611,1650.715,I would love a little more understanding.,43,,
182,0.97,1650.715,1663.995,I don't believe your suggesting that the community engagement element here is--is constituted by the mayors task force of 40 individuals.,43,,
183,0.97,1663.995,1665.93,I'd really like to know more about that.,43,,
184,0.97,1665.93,1680.111,"I'm going to just say, I'm concerned this process as it has been scoped is likely to delay change even further.",43,,
185,0.97,1680.111,1700.532,"Council past it's Rebalanced budget eight weeks ago and in that Rebalanced budget we did a 911 call analysis I'm not going to suggest it was robust but it was thorough enough, thank you doctor Fisher, to let us know what our next set of questions should be from the analysis we did.",43,,
186,0.97,1700.532,1713.478,"We also requested, this is my third time mentioning it, sorry for beating a dead horse, we requested by December 30 an analysis of what functions and SPD could be civilian eyes.",43,,
187,0.97,1713.478,1724.055,"I would expect it, rather than spending time going back and forth about whether or not we're going to sustain or override the veto.",43,,
188,0.97,1724.055,1734.399,"Some of this work would've been done because it was work that we agreed, the executive and the Council, it's work we both want on.",43,,
189,0.97,1734.399,1747.812,"So again, I would like to be further along in this sort of Reimagining process so we can begin to stand up some of the other support functions.",43,,
190,0.97,1747.812,1763.027,"And, again, just back to the question, the question is going back, about what is the mechanism for community outreach and engagement for each of the steps?",43,,
191,0.97,1763.027,1775.24,I really don't want this effort to be shifting attention away from processes that are underway to generate plans for safety.,43,,
192,0.97,1775.24,1779.31,That being a separate process and conversation.,43,,
193,0.97,1779.31,1781.646,It too is designed to provide solutions.,43,,
194,0.97,1781.646,1782.347,Thank you.,43,,
195,0.97,1782.347,1797.462,I know Andres Mantilla and director Johnson will be addressing this later on.,44,,
196,0.97,1797.462,1802.634,Suffice it to say there is going to be a community engagement report available at the end of October.,44,,
197,0.97,1802.634,1813.244,"And to answer one of your other questions regarding the Idt, we anticipate making, we anticipate it to be reporting a publicly regularly on its analysis and gather data.",44,,
198,0.97,1813.244,1816.08,And understanding functional priorities.,44,,
199,0.97,1816.08,1832.096,"So, I beg your pardon for just a little bit, I think questions regarding public engagement can be best answered by Jason.",44,,
200,0.97,1832.096,1836.801,Councilmember Morales did you have a question?,45,,
201,0.97,1836.801,1837.602,I do.,46,,
202,0.97,1837.602,1859.324,"Going back to the previous slide, although I guess it doesn't really matter, I am interested in, you explained a little bit about who will be on these two different entities, so it's Department heads on the Workgroup, and I am assuming apartment staff on Idt.",46,,
203,0.97,1859.324,1874.606,I am interested to know how those decisions were made and how these folks or this work will be able to engage in a racially equitable way.,46,,
204,0.97,1874.606,1884.716,What we are hearing from community is that all of this work should be community led when it comes to what we are identifying as priorities.,46,,
205,0.97,1884.716,1893.057,"Having a Top-Down approach to that issue identification is somewhat problematic, that is my first question.",46,,
206,0.97,1893.057,1896.06,How will that be able to happen.,46,,
207,0.97,1896.06,1906.671,"My second question in terms of how these groups were formed, what racial equity principles were used to create these two Workgroups?",46,,
208,0.97,1906.671,1918.449,And were the Co-Leads involved in helping think through how to create these?,46,,
209,0.97,1918.449,1920.084,To answer your second question first.,47,,
210,0.97,1920.084,1937.969,"I think ultimately the community safety board group is comprised of the directors who, some of this work will end with, and some of this work, in specific some of the public engagement, needs to kind of rely on their advice and Council.",47,,
211,0.97,1937.969,1947.111,That would be the Seattle office of civil rights is going to play an important role in that.,47,,
212,0.97,1947.111,1949.681,And that was how the community safety Workgroup was born.,47,,
213,0.97,1949.681,1980.445,"You are correct that the Idt, functional analysis Idt is a smaller group of working staff that are there to be sort of technical advisors and gather information and data from subject matter experts to answer some of the bigger policy questions that the Workgroup is going to encounter through their public engagement work . I think one of the guiding principles we are really focused on here is, we have general areas ideas and places where there could be functional change or shifts.",47,,
214,0.97,1980.445,1990.755,"But, we are trying not to preordained any results before there is public engagement.",47,,
215,0.97,1990.755,1997.662,I didn't hear anything in an answer about how the actual engagement will work.,48,,
216,0.97,1997.662,2003.267,"How the Idt will engage with community to get the information, the form and functional decision.",48,,
217,0.97,2003.267,2016.581,"Councilmember Herbold, director Andres Mantilla and director Johnson will go over the public engagement later in the presentation.",49,,
218,0.97,2016.581,2016.948,Okay.,50,,
219,0.97,2016.948,2024.188,"If you can address then whether racial equity principles were created, used in creating these two groups.",50,,
220,0.97,2024.188,2028.092,"Council number, I will Interject for a quick second.",51,,
221,0.97,2028.092,2036.0,"And again, director Andres Mantilla can go into this in more detail.",51,,
222,0.97,2036.0,2042.206,Our engagement around this body of work isn't something we are initiating as part of this Idt process.,51,,
223,0.97,2042.206,2050.014,"In fact, we have done a round of engagements with all of the offices of civil rights commissions prior to shaping this Eo.",51,,
224,0.97,2050.014,2065.563,"That effort has helped inform and we brought the functional analysis discussion, 911 elements to the table that house helped inform our thinking as far as how we established these two working groups internally.",51,,
225,0.97,2065.563,2088.119,"As Julie has mentioned, clearly as we have talked about community engagement being a key piece of this body of work, our intention is clearly to have that be driving both what we will be looking at and the continuous feedback as far as how Prioritization flows.",51,,
226,0.97,2088.119,2098.663,"Both directors, director Johnson and director Mantilla could talk about specific strategies we've outlined for community engagement.",51,,
227,0.97,2098.663,2102.667,But at the same time this is an area we welcome continued dialogue from.,51,,
228,0.97,2102.667,2115.379,We know you and your colleagues have been invested in that budgeting process and we want to also hear from you how you see that research to be integrated in this conversation.,51,,
229,0.97,2115.379,2124.655,By no means do we feel like we have identified the entirety of how to proceed with the community conversation here.,51,,
230,0.97,2124.655,2132.763,"And at the same time, welcome your perspective as well as your colleagues perspective as we continue to shape this.",51,,
231,0.97,2132.763,2147.578,This is precisely why we have anticipated ongoing engagement with Council staff as part of this effort.,51,,
232,0.97,2147.578,2150.281,"So, I know folks are eager to move to the community engagement piece.",51,,
233,0.97,2150.281,2152.183,I think it's a couple of slides from here.,51,,
234,0.97,2152.183,2155.086,If you'll indulge us to get through this we will certainly address community engagement.,51,,
235,0.97,2155.086,2158.923,I still don't have an answer to the question about racial equity principles.,52,,
236,0.97,2158.923,2168.499,"I hear you that the commissions might've been contacted about this, so I would be interested to hear what feedback they have.",52,,
237,0.97,2168.499,2181.112,"But, if you can answer the question about whether Rsji teams were involved or what tools were used to form these groups, I would appreciate it.",52,,
238,0.97,2181.112,2192.657,"I think we just tried to be--since these are not necessarily going to be the Decision-Makers, I think we wanted to make sure we had the right Department heads.",53,,
239,0.97,2192.657,2197.428,That is how the Workgroup was formed.,53,,
240,0.97,2197.428,2216.047,"I think the public engagement aspect of it is where the Rsji, I'm sorry, the real need for the Rsji analysis and inclusion is going to be in the public engagement analysis of this.",53,,
241,0.97,2216.047,2224.088,The Workgroup is there to essentially take the public engagement guidance and turn it into policy and implemented.,53,,
242,0.97,2224.088,2232.463,Once we are hearing clearly what functions they would like to see replaced and what they would like to see them replaced with.,53,,
243,0.97,2232.463,2241.405,"Councilmember Morales, thank you for your questions.",54,,
244,0.97,2241.405,2243.007,I think they are prudent at this point.,54,,
245,0.97,2243.007,2247.378,I just want to make sure you made a note of the questions that did not get answered for community engagement.,54,,
246,0.97,2247.378,2251.315,"I have Council President Gonzalez, next.",54,,
247,0.97,2251.315,2252.316,Please go ahead.,54,,
248,0.97,2252.316,2258.222,Thank you so much.,55,,
249,0.97,2258.222,2278.643,"I think what I am hearing in terms of the response is that in Rsji, was not completed or done as it relates to the concepts of whether or not the community safety Workgroup and the Idt should exist.",55,,
250,0.97,2278.643,2292.423,"The Rsji Toolkit wasn't used to drive the creation of the concept of the Workgroup for the Idt, is that accurate?",55,,
251,0.97,2292.423,2293.357,That is accurate.,56,,
252,0.97,2293.357,2320.851,"What you are saying and what I am hearing, there is an opportunity now and moving forward to hear directly from Council members about those kinds of bodies of work that we want to see incorporated in the community safety Workgroup and the Idt now that the Mayor has issued an executive order declaring her intent to head in that direction.",57,,
253,0.97,2320.851,2322.353,That is the invitation I am hearing.,57,,
254,0.97,2322.353,2326.49,Is that an accurate characterization of that invitation?,57,,
255,0.97,2326.49,2329.76,That is correct.,58,,
256,0.97,2329.76,2335.666,Great.,59,,
257,0.97,2335.666,2341.906,So I just want to highlight a couple of things in the spirit of hearing that invitation and wanting to accept it.,59,,
258,0.97,2341.906,2361.625,"And help to potentially shape this into something that will be, that will have great utility, not just to us is a C makers Úbut will be legitimate and important and meaningful to particularly communities.",59,,
259,0.97,2361.625,2368.599,And so there's a couple of things.,59,,
260,0.97,2368.599,2374.438,"One is, you all might be aware of some of the criminal legal system realignment work that the Council has been doing over the last two years.",59,,
261,0.97,2374.438,2378.943,Maybe a year and a half at this point.,59,,
262,0.97,2378.943,2395.025,That process does include a broad set of Stakeholders that are looking at a host of recommendations and bodies of work that have been done across the legal system and criminal legal system.,59,,
263,0.97,2395.025,2397.027,That just kicked off last week.,59,,
264,0.97,2397.027,2417.782,Carlos from our Council central staff has been leading that work along with others . I want to encourage us to make sure that we are not Duplicating community engagement efforts particularly in the space.,59,,
265,0.97,2417.782,2424.855,I think you hear a lot from Stakeholders that they get community engagement exhaustion.,59,,
266,0.97,2424.855,2447.411,"Of being engaged repeatedly on the same issues or similar issues and that it's important for us to try, as the owners of bureaucracy to strike and streamline those processes to the greatest extent as possible to not create fatigue within community.",59,,
267,0.97,2447.411,2448.112,That is one point.,59,,
268,0.97,2448.112,2478.442,"The second point is, as we are looking at structuring the community safety Workgroup I think it's important for us to apply the racial social justice Toolkit as it's being described to make sure that structurally we are not creating any unintended consequences in terms of excluding those voices we need to be at the center of the conversation which again, are the voices of community members.",59,,
269,0.97,2478.442,2487.618,Those are just two pieces I like to give feedback on.,59,,
270,0.97,2487.618,2492.456,"And from the 30,000 foot level, I know there are folks including members of this Council who are skeptical of this body of work.",59,,
271,0.97,2492.456,2505.069,Part of our work is as Council members is to apply scrutiny and to take our function as oversight really seriously.,59,,
272,0.97,2505.069,2506.704,And I think we all are doing that.,59,,
273,0.97,2506.704,2535.499,"I just want to say from the 30,000 foot level that in our conversations with you all around negotiating a potential substitute bill, if, depending on how the override on the Mayor's Vetoes when, we talked a lot about the concept of how important it was to bring a diverse set of voices to the table to help guide these critical and important conversations about public safety.",59,,
274,0.97,2535.499,2548.112,"So, I am going to, until I see otherwise, I'm going to believe this proposal is being set forward in that spirit.",59,,
275,0.97,2548.112,2562.726,And I'm heartened to hear there is still an invitation for Council and Council central staff to participate in the Idt process and be engaged in the community Workgroup process.,59,,
276,0.97,2562.726,2565.496,I think it's important for us to have a voice in those conversations.,59,,
277,0.97,2565.496,2572.703,I think the people we represent expect that we will be able to come together and to sort out our differences.,59,,
278,0.97,2572.703,2600.164,"And again, we may not agree on the outcome, here, but I do think it's an important effort to undergo together and see if we can find some alignment here and if we can work together to make sure the both the community safety Workgroup and the Idt is going to be representative of councils priorities and of the constituencies we represent.",59,,
279,0.97,2600.164,2603.567,Thank you.,59,,
280,0.97,2603.567,2616.847,"I know chair Mosqueda, in the interest of time I want to keep moving.",60,,
281,0.97,2616.847,2634.598,The only comment I will make is I appreciate the comments and I concur that throughout our conversations through the negotiations related to compromise we talked about looking at how we can work towards a framework centering around community and to be able to proceed together between legislative and executive branches.,60,,
282,0.97,2634.598,2635.499,That commitment still stands.,60,,
283,0.97,2635.499,2641.605,I look forward to working with you and Council central staff.,60,,
284,0.97,2641.605,2662.292,At the same time I just want to also mention part of the interest in ensuring that we are true to Rsji commitment and values is partly why the Cochairs of the community safety Workgroup involve Department heads that are beyond just the police Department.,60,,
285,0.97,2662.292,2670.401,"There is a reason why the human services Department, DOM, are part of the Coronation of this work.",60,,
286,0.97,2670.401,2684.448,"And again, I will defer some of this discussion component to director Mantilla because I think he can speak much more in depth about some of the councils interest with regard to engagement and community.",60,,
287,0.97,2684.448,2688.118,"So, I will leave it at that.",60,,
288,0.97,2688.118,2694.358,And chair Mosqueda if there are other questions we will take them before we keep moving on.,60,,
289,0.97,2694.358,2695.225,I appreciate that.,61,,
290,0.97,2695.225,2701.665,"Thank you very much, deputy Mayor.",61,,
291,0.97,2701.665,2703.534,I will echo with the Council President said as well.,61,,
292,0.97,2703.534,2717.281,"I think it's important to hear that you want to improve the Council and interdepartmental task force, I agree with what they said as well that it's really important that we accept community feedback given that's an insular body and we are looking forward to hearing more about that.",61,,
293,0.97,2717.281,2726.09,I heard the invitation there and I hear the Council President echoing the importance of that.,61,,
294,0.97,2726.09,2747.811,"I also think it's really important as we move forward that we continue to have honest conversations amongst ourselves and in the press, there was a question I have about the third bullet here regarding building community capacity or building capacity as we think about investing in community to reduce funding in SPD.",61,,
295,0.97,2747.811,2749.48,It's got to be the right Teeter Totter.,61,,
296,0.97,2749.48,2759.99,"Julie, I think you are eluding to that, I'm sorry Julie, it wasn't you, it was we can follow up with her.",61,,
297,0.97,2759.99,2788.719,"The comment was made that the budget is assumed included the status quo maintenance of existing Ftes because there was I guess a question mark on how quickly those dollars could get out to the community, the question I had for the executive team is regarding the press release that went out yesterday.",61,,
298,0.97,2788.719,2799.963,"The bottom half of the press release regarding the $14 million for Community-Based organizations, it says from the Mayor's memo, however, my concern centers around Council seeking to borrow money with no identified source.",61,,
299,0.97,2799.963,2812.376,Is it your hope we can identify a way to address the $14 million as part of the 21 process?,61,,
300,0.97,2812.376,2816.079,"Pretty Mayor, you also mentioned or commented on the $14 million as you began the call this morning.",61,,
301,0.97,2816.079,2825.789,"I think it's important that we clarify, we have chatted about this this morning, it is important to note the Council did have identified source.",61,,
302,0.97,2825.789,2833.163,"In section 3 of Council bill 119683 which was veto and overridden, it provides two approaches for paying $13.1 million through and Interfund loan.",61,,
303,0.97,2833.163,2852.115,"While the Mayor may not have liked that, even though I did have a conversation with her and she said, this was last Tuesday, she did not have a concern with using Interfund loan at that point, even if there is disagreement about the approach, it's a far cry from actually being able to have identified a source.",61,,
304,0.97,2852.115,2871.401,"In section 3 it clearly identifies using Interfund loan or if the Interfund loan savings are not able to be realized, then we would use savings from SPD, I'm sorry if the SPD savings are not able to be realized we would use funding from Jumpstart if necessary.",61,,
305,0.97,2871.401,2873.737,We clearly had identified source for the Interfund loan.,61,,
306,0.97,2873.737,2893.624,"Can you please comment on whether or not we are misunderstanding or there are folks from central staff who might want to Chime in, there is clearly a $13.1 million pool we planned to pay back . I am confused why the thing which is can included in the press release yesterday.",61,,
307,0.97,2893.624,2894.925,I think I can clarify.,62,,
308,0.97,2894.925,2908.672,The issue is that the proposed budget we have submitted to you doesn't assume further reductions in SPD that could be used to repay that $14 million.,62,,
309,0.97,2908.672,2978.942,"In the in our--that is a statement of fact, not anything more than that.",62,,
310,0.97,2978.942,2985.248,"If are going to move forward with the $14 million our budget doesn't have it, you guys are going to have to work on that.",62,,
311,0.97,2985.248,2986.917,You seem quite prepared to do that.,62,,
312,0.97,2986.917,2989.753,Just fine which is why we are ready to move forward.,62,,
313,0.97,2989.753,2994.458,Deputy Mayor?,63,,
314,0.97,2994.458,3003.767,I think Ben has articulated the technical aspect of this.,64,,
315,0.97,3003.767,3007.637,I wanted to share that I think we are on the same page as far as intent and interest.,64,,
316,0.97,3007.637,3022.586,Council has made it clear we want to push these resources out the door . director Johnson can elaborate later in the presentation as far as some of his planning and approach to the next couple of months of work to make that a reality.,64,,
317,0.97,3022.586,3040.103,I think the budget mechanics are largely associated with when those dollars need to be available for contracts and at the end of the day the 21 budget needs to reflect the identification of that $14 million.,64,,
318,0.97,3040.103,3053.517,"Otherwise, I think we are on the same page and we have every intention of moving forward as quickly as we can with the one piece discussed this morning which was the Council action I believe did require us to come back with an ordinance to actually articulate our game plan for release of those funds.",64,,
319,0.97,3053.517,3063.226,And we want to have some conversation about what level of detail you are expecting for us to bill to get that lifted for the resources to go out.,64,,
320,0.97,3063.226,3068.999,"But again, conceptually, we are on the same page.",64,,
321,0.97,3068.999,3075.839,I don't think intent is lost on the executive as far as what your expectations are.,64,,
322,0.97,3075.839,3080.944,"Thank you for those comments, deputy Mayor and director noble.",65,,
323,0.97,3080.944,3084.047,Did you have anything you would like to add?,65,,
324,0.97,3084.047,3108.738,"Nothing, I wouldn't disagree with anything that director noble or senior deputy Mayor Fong said, a be just a finer point on where there may be disagreement here in just pointing out the Council provided policy direction about how they intended, how you all intended to fund those $14 million of investments.",66,,
325,0.97,3108.738,3125.989,"The Mayor transmitted a budget that didn't fulfill that policy direction which would've been either reducing the SPD budget by an additional $14 million or $13.1 million to back that Interfund loan, to pay back the Interfund loan.",66,,
326,0.97,3125.989,3134.764,Or to dedicate $13.1 million of Jumpstart money which is part of the general fund for this purpose.,66,,
327,0.97,3134.764,3137.067,And that is not what was in the budget that was proposed.,66,,
328,0.97,3137.067,3157.687,So now the Council is faced with looking at making those reductions in SPD or Reprogramming other general fund spending in the proposed budget.,66,,
329,0.97,3157.687,3159.923,I just wanted to maybe put a finer point on that.,66,,
330,0.97,3159.923,3160.724,Thank you.,67,,
331,0.97,3160.724,3162.192,I'm happy to come back to this.,67,,
332,0.97,3162.192,3163.827,I think that underscores the point I am making.,67,,
333,0.97,3163.827,3170.1,We are now in a position of either having to take up funding from Jumpstart which we had already anticipated for something else versus having it come from the SPD budget.,67,,
334,0.97,3170.1,3185.315,"So it's really a matter of the policy choices versus what I think was in the press release yesterday, failed to articulate, we had a plan, we have a plan.",67,,
335,0.97,3185.315,3195.492,And specifically state there is commitment to move forward with getting those dollars out the door.,67,,
336,0.97,3195.492,3204.634,It's really just a matter of us not having to make these policy choices that undermined our initial plan.,67,,
337,0.97,3204.634,3206.136,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",67,,
338,0.97,3206.136,3206.87,Thank you.,68,,
339,0.97,3206.87,3208.939,I know we all want to move on from this topic.,68,,
340,0.97,3208.939,3214.778,"But, I really appreciate director noble, you explaining what the steps are moving forward.",68,,
341,0.97,3214.778,3233.063,"But, I did not hear an answer to chair Mosqueda's question, why did the press release go out saying the Mayor's concern centered around no identified funding source.",68,,
342,0.97,3233.063,3236.566,Why are those words in a press release when they are completely untrue?,68,,
343,0.97,3236.566,3251.014,"I'm not sure I see the difference, we are moving with the $14 million expenditure that has been required of us that is not yet been identified.",69,,
344,0.97,3251.014,3252.115,That's all we are saying.,69,,
345,0.97,3252.115,3258.121,But we are moving forward because Council is clear about its intent.,69,,
346,0.97,3258.121,3259.723,We were clear about our intent.,70,,
347,0.97,3259.723,3263.326,Identified a funding source to pay off the borrowed money.,70,,
348,0.97,3263.326,3274.738,"Again, the proposed budget we had delivered to you doesn't say $14 million in 2021 to repay this.",71,,
349,0.97,3274.738,3277.54,Understood.,72,,
350,0.97,3277.54,3280.443,"Again, if anyone's fault it's mine.",73,,
351,0.97,3280.443,3286.65,"We were preparing the budget in the space where the Mayor had vetoed, there was no set line that space.",73,,
352,0.97,3286.65,3291.354,So we made a set of assumptions about it.,73,,
353,0.97,3291.354,3295.959,In any case you have the final word and we are doing is requested.,73,,
354,0.97,3295.959,3297.427,We are moving forward with the $14 million.,73,,
355,0.97,3297.427,3301.364,I want to highlight that it's going to need some offsetting funding to get there.,73,,
356,0.97,3301.364,3307.57,"Again, you have identified a couple of ways to do it.",73,,
357,0.97,3307.57,3312.075,And conversations today have indicated that,73,,
358,0.97,3312.075,3314.944,I don't think you should take the blame.,74,,
359,0.97,3314.944,3316.78,This is not about how the budget was prepared.,74,,
360,0.97,3316.78,3324.187,"You made a choice which you can do to not, in preparing the budget, to not have used certain dollars as a fund source to repay this loan.",74,,
361,0.97,3324.187,3347.677,"The issue that chair Mosqueda is raising, is that in moving forward and building trust between the executive and the Council, we need to know there are accurate statements being said in the press about our actions.",74,,
362,0.97,3347.677,3349.779,And this statement says we did not identify a funding source.,74,,
363,0.97,3349.779,3352.716,And we did.,74,,
364,0.97,3352.716,3355.518,"You chose not to use it, that is your Prerogatie.",74,,
365,0.97,3355.518,3367.13,"Thank you Councilmember Herbold . I will also add, I believe, director noble, you probably didn't offer the press release yourself.",75,,
366,0.97,3367.13,3393.723,"This is an important message and I'm hoping you can take back as well as we talk about voting trust and figure out a way both executive branch and legislative branch can move forward, I think it's an important NOTE we have honest conversations amongst ourselves here and also via the press that this is a tool that has been often used to get messages out.",75,,
367,0.97,3393.723,3407.57,"I think it's important, that is the message I'm hoping you can bring back because the press release was just released yesterday.",75,,
368,0.97,3407.57,3413.476,"Thank you, Council members.",76,,
369,0.97,3413.476,3418.681,"All right, let's move on to the next slide.",77,,
370,0.97,3418.681,3444.507,"As I mentioned earlier, there have already, through various other means of community engagement and messages we have gotten clearly from community and our partners in this area, a number of places we have already identified that we will need to advocate for changes in state law, we can't just effectuate change how we would like at the city level or even at the county level.",77,,
371,0.97,3444.507,3451.214,This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of legislative changes we should be seeking in this arena.,77,,
372,0.97,3451.214,3457.72,"This is a starting point we have identified based on, like I said, prior community engagement.",77,,
373,0.97,3457.72,3472.202,"I can tick down these quickly but it goes to law enforcement certification, statewide system, changes to the statewide decertification system that can take years.",77,,
374,0.97,3472.202,3477.04,So we are not recycling police officers were pending the certification into other jurisdictions across the state.,77,,
375,0.97,3477.04,3479.843,Statewide reform of police labor laws.,77,,
376,0.97,3479.843,3483.112,We have talked about those previously.,77,,
377,0.97,3483.112,3491.221,The limitations we face in negotiating with SP Ma.,77,,
378,0.97,3491.221,3500.063,"And statewide standard policies and training on use of force, body cameras, crowd management.",77,,
379,0.97,3500.063,3507.537,Create an independent statewide entity of some sort to investigate and prosecute police officers.,77,,
380,0.97,3507.537,3528.091,"And I think the important part of that is fairness and the appearance of fairness, taking that investigation and determination out of the hands of what are essentially local law enforcement partners to the police agencies, that that member may be a part of.",77,,
381,0.97,3528.091,3539.802,And then increasing subpoena power for police misconduct investigations for civilian oversight entities.,77,,
382,0.97,3539.802,3557.253,"And a statewide standard inquest procedure reflects the reforms that were attempted to be embodied in the King County executive order that was just overturned that reflects the transparency, accountability and support to the families of the deceased that need to be there.",77,,
383,0.97,3557.253,3567.397,"So, like I said, this is a starting point, a jumping off point for state legislative changes for the next session in January.",77,,
384,0.97,3567.397,3577.74,Through community engagement we fully expect this list to grow.,77,,
385,0.97,3577.874,3580.543,I'm single questions.,78,,
386,0.97,3580.543,3584.047,"Excuse me, Council President Gonzalez.",78,,
387,0.97,3584.047,3588.718,"I appreciate this, thank you so much.",79,,
388,0.97,3588.718,3595.058,Good to get this out early.,79,,
389,0.97,3595.058,3608.871,"On the second point that talks about statewide reform of police labor laws, that is pretty generic.",79,,
390,0.97,3608.871,3610.873,Can you tell me what the intent is there?,79,,
391,0.97,3610.873,3615.011,It would defer to our labor policy experts in this arena on what needs to be changed going forward.,80,,
392,0.97,3615.011,3622.318,I think we are still identifying areas that are in the early stages of planning for negotiations for the next contract.,80,,
393,0.97,3622.318,3623.686,Am not qualified to answer those questions.,80,,
394,0.97,3623.686,3624.887,We can get you those answers.,80,,
395,0.97,3624.887,3627.557,The specific areas we have already identified.,80,,
396,0.97,3627.557,3659.422,"Yeah, I think it would be important, particularly as it relates to any issues related to labor laws, that those be--my request would be as the chair of the select labor Committee for the city Council and is a member of the labor relations policy Committee, that there would be an opportunity for discussion about that body of work in terms of lobbying efforts.",81,,
397,0.97,3659.422,3682.345,That that conversation be queued up in the labor relations policy committee again to ensure that there is opportunity for maximum alignment between what the Council members would like to see Prioritized in this lobbying agenda and what the Mayor would like to see Prioritized there.,81,,
398,0.97,3682.345,3694.624,The earlier and the sooner we do that less likely we are going to run into issues once our lobbyists are done in Olympia doing the hard work we know they do.,81,,
399,0.97,3694.624,3695.224,Absolutely.,82,,
400,0.97,3695.224,3702.865,I know the Mayor previously sent the Mayor to the governor has slightly more details than I was able to give you Off-The- cuff.,82,,
401,0.97,3702.865,3704.767,We will get more details to you all.,82,,
402,0.97,3704.767,3742.905,"And I will just sort of, for the sake of transparency, daylight the fact that for me it's really important to address issues of discipline, particularly as it relates to arbitration, that is an area where even when officers are disciplined or terminated, there is a lot of opportunity to overturn those decisions in those binding arbitration processes and I think there is an opportunity for us to take a second look at the equity issues related to the arbitration system, binding arbitration system as a relates to police unions.",83,,
403,0.97,3742.905,3749.612,"I know for a fact, Council President, that that is on the Mayor's list.",84,,
404,0.97,3749.612,3751.714,"Top-Of-The-Line, probably for the same reasons it's on your list.",84,,
405,0.97,3751.714,3754.884,Absolutely that is included on the list.,84,,
406,0.97,3754.884,3756.119,Please go ahead.,85,,
407,0.97,3756.119,3767.296,I also wanted to note that I am aware that both the Commission and office of the inspector general are both also preparing state legislative Agendas.,86,,
408,0.97,3767.296,3777.54,So in your community engagement and perhaps through our select labor committee we can have that discussion with them as well.,86,,
409,0.97,3777.54,3784.113,Great.,87,,
410,0.97,3784.113,3793.055,Okay.,87,,
411,0.97,3793.055,3811.774,"So this is a little bit more detail and interplay between the community safety Workgroup which is sort of, receiver of the Ideation, and the Workhorse which is sort of the functional analysis Idt.",87,,
412,0.97,3811.774,3821.884,"Together they will be facilitating outreach and engagement, collaborate with accountability Stakeholders, specifically OPA, Oig.",87,,
413,0.97,3821.884,3828.791,"And other subject matter experts for some topics that are going to be the commissions, as Councilmember Morales mentioned earlier.",87,,
414,0.97,3828.791,3834.497,For some issues that is going to be labor experts.,87,,
415,0.97,3834.497,3843.272,We want to make sure we are drying on as much resource as we can.,87,,
416,0.97,3843.272,3852.415,"We are looking at doing SPD fiscal analysis, I detailed this a little earlier.",87,,
417,0.97,3852.415,3858.487,How those expenditures are tied to the functional priorities the community wants to see.,87,,
418,0.97,3858.487,3864.594,"The functional analysis, so current functions looking at specialty units, recommendations again of what should be limited, reduced, civilian eyes or expanded.",87,,
419,0.97,3864.594,3871.1,"And the 911 call analysis, a deeper dive than the Council asked for earlier.",87,,
420,0.97,3871.1,3879.408,And a little more of an analysis versus sort of a data dump on you all.,87,,
421,0.97,3879.408,3886.749,And how that relates to the functional priorities we are hearing from community and what that means for staff.,87,,
422,0.97,3886.749,3890.953,We are going to do the next step essentially in that analysis.,87,,
423,0.97,3890.953,3918.18,"And that is the last bullet, how all of the above figures into personnel and staffing and what changes can be made to with the minimum staffing needs are and reassessing attrition trends, recruitment needs, specifically called out in the Eo how we can eliminate or significant reduce that by proper staffing.",87,,
424,0.97,3918.18,3921.384,A lot of other things I have heard being mentioned by Council members.,87,,
425,0.97,3921.384,3926.489,I know you talked about early retirement incentive options.,87,,
426,0.97,3926.489,3936.098,All of that is on the table figuring out what's going to be workable and make a difference budget wise.,87,,
427,0.97,3936.098,3943.639,What is going to make a difference staffing wise and routing it in the functional priorities we are hearing from the community.,87,,
428,0.97,3951.847,3955.584,And now I'm going to turn it over to director Mantilla.,87,,
429,0.97,3955.584,3961.724,I don't know if director Johnson is weighing in on this one as well?,87,,
430,0.97,3961.724,3965.728,"Thank you, Julie.",88,,
431,0.97,3965.728,3966.529,Thank you Madam chair.,88,,
432,0.97,3966.529,3970.399,I know there are a lot of questions that come up through the presentation.,88,,
433,0.97,3970.399,3973.736,I'd like to address some of those first and then go through the slides.,88,,
434,0.97,3973.736,3980.643,And then I think director Johnson will weigh in on a different slide with his input as well.,88,,
435,0.97,3980.643,3988.117,It might be helpful to think through how the concept around community safety in the Workgroup came to be.,88,,
436,0.97,3988.117,4006.769,"That Workgroup, and the issue of community safety is based on now weeks and months of work with different directors and different staff . mini frontline staff and those involved in a lot of the programs that are centering in impacted communities, Bipoc.",88,,
437,0.97,4006.769,4022.051,"To build on a comment, understanding that we have heard different feedback for not just weeks, months but years in terms of what community is asking for.",88,,
438,0.97,4022.051,4027.089,"Is really something that is driven, the Department of neighborhoods, and specifically the groups and departments working on this.",88,,
439,0.97,4027.089,4034.397,"But through that process we really identified, and this gets to the question that Councilmember Morales talked about, a set of guiding principles.",88,,
440,0.97,4034.397,4036.999,And a set of North Star's if you will.,88,,
441,0.97,4036.999,4046.776,Really around centering race and centering most impacted communities in the Decision- making and policymaking of these efforts.,88,,
442,0.97,4046.776,4056.419,Allowing for kind of empowering communities to make their own decisions and forge their own solutions.,88,,
443,0.97,4056.419,4066.228,And also making sure that the community had the resources available to do that.,88,,
444,0.97,4066.228,4101.63,"The community capacity question that has been brought up before, those grounding principles, need to be translated into the Workgroup and the Workgroup itself as a whole, as we have talked now about the Idt, the investment task force, and I think the next step of what we need to do, and thank you for offering that partnership, is really center and ground ourselves in the common principles as well as invite it in a more formal way to come in and be part of the conversation.",88,,
445,0.97,4101.63,4112.141,"What is clear to me as we go through this, and several of you Council members have brought this up in the conversation, there needs to be clear alignment across all of the engagement opportunities happening.",88,,
446,0.97,4112.141,4116.545,We want to make sure that we are understanding the overlap and conversations.,88,,
447,0.97,4116.545,4123.986,We are understanding their conversations happening on slightly different Timelines.,88,,
448,0.97,4123.986,4125.721,Some that are focused on the Vestment.,88,,
449,0.97,4125.721,4129.892,Some focused on investment and upstream investments community.,88,,
450,0.97,4129.892,4140.102,Want to make sure Riley citywide engagement includes perspectives that reflect on racial and cultural realities happening in our communities.,88,,
451,0.97,4140.102,4143.305,That is going to require us to look at a menu of options.,88,,
452,0.97,4143.305,4155.684,"I know there has been conversations around budgeting, we understand, as you all know, Participatory budgeting, neighborhoods through your voice, your choice program.",88,,
453,0.97,4155.684,4166.495,We love to continue and partner with community on that to understand their roadmap and understand how we could provide some assistance and technical assistance to that.,88,,
454,0.97,4166.495,4174.737,We understand the broader engagement has to happen and be aligned with the hundred million dollar task force we will go into a little later.,88,,
455,0.97,4174.737,4187.483,"What is crucial about this though, regardless as we do Online engagement, Prioritization tool, to understand the policy functional shifts, too often the engagement stays is just engagement.",88,,
456,0.97,4187.483,4191.453,We need to intentionally tie to policy decisions.,88,,
457,0.97,4191.453,4215.377,"This is why you have seen the cycle of engagement ongoing, even as you have seen the report is due in October, he needs to be an ongoing cycle of engagement so we are not only bringing in the feedback from all of these alternative ways we are talking into policy decisions, but also reflected back out to community so folks understanding how the feedback is influencing and affecting the decisions made.",88,,
458,0.97,4215.377,4222.284,That is when we talk about this Iterative roadmap for community feedback.,88,,
459,0.97,4222.284,4225.688,The purpose of the engagement is not to shift away attention from anything going on.,88,,
460,0.97,4225.688,4228.19,True engagement has to bring all voices to the table.,88,,
461,0.97,4228.19,4233.662,Have heard clear from community some priorities.,88,,
462,0.97,4233.662,4238.367,We want to honor those priorities and we want to incorporate them in the engagement we are talking about.,88,,
463,0.97,4238.367,4252.114,But I want to just echo and thank you for that partnership offer and we would love to continue this conversation with yourselves or your staff in this process as we move forward.,88,,
464,0.97,4252.114,4253.916,Thank you.,88,,
465,0.97,4253.916,4255.718,Thank you.,89,,
466,0.97,4255.718,4258.621,I see no questions.,89,,
467,0.97,4258.621,4265.794,"Councilmember Morales, go ahead.",89,,
468,0.97,4265.794,4267.529,I was delayed on seeing the hand.,89,,
469,0.97,4267.529,4268.097,That's okay.,90,,
470,0.97,4268.097,4270.432,I was still kind of forming the question in my head.,90,,
471,0.97,4270.432,4295.424,"I guess my first question is, what is the plan for funding this community engagement? as you know counsel, if we are planning to use Rsji fronts bowls the budget for this work would include funding, community members for their participation, translation services, child care if necessary, all that.",90,,
472,0.97,4295.424,4298.661,What is the plan for funding that work?,90,,
473,0.97,4298.661,4320.249,"And then my second question is, how will the Idt and Workgroup, what is the relationship between those two groups and this equitable investment task force?",90,,
474,0.97,4320.249,4335.864,"Yeah, so we have been allocated some funding, and we believe strongly in participation as you know and conversations we have had together, we believe paid participation is part of the equitable task force and is essential in honoring and respecting time of community.",91,,
475,0.97,4335.864,4345.374,"We plan on building in a budget and estimate resources for interpretation, for paid participation as well.",91,,
476,0.97,4345.374,4361.223,"I think what is key in hearing and thinking about your question is internal coordination of how we are receiving and processing this feedback and bringing it back to community, there obviously has to be aligned.",91,,
477,0.97,4361.223,4388.851,"Part of the Workgroup, this is why some of the functional analysis and element for equitable development task force need to be brought in internal alignment closer together so we understand there are overlaps in terms of feedback . We have been doing, senior deputy Mayor Fong spoke about, this is the start of the engagement.",91,,
478,0.97,4388.851,4392.121,"We have been doing engagement with partners OCR, SPD, human services Department as well, prior.",91,,
479,0.97,4392.121,4413.575,"And it's clear what we hear from community as they talk about the functional analysis SPD, not just the investment but also the upstream as well, we need to make sure we are coordinated in terms of that feedback.",91,,
480,0.97,4413.575,4421.95,"I'm sorry, was there a follow-up Councilmember Morales?",92,,
481,0.97,4421.95,4425.788,Thank you very much.,92,,
482,0.97,4425.788,4427.656,I don't see any additional hands.,92,,
483,0.97,4427.656,4433.896,Let's continue.,92,,
484,0.97,4433.896,4439.401,"All right, mark, where are you?",92,,
485,0.97,4439.401,4441.77,"There you are, mark.",92,,
486,0.97,4441.77,4446.775,I am mark with SPD.,93,,
487,0.97,4446.775,4465.627,"In terms of Reimagining community safety, really is part of the outreach and engagement that was just discussed, facilitated through the community safety Idt, it will involve looking at new models of policing and community safety.",93,,
488,0.97,4465.627,4472.334,And roughly organized into about four categories.,93,,
489,0.97,4472.334,4475.504,Most of the topics and ideas have come out between this morning and this afternoon already.,93,,
490,0.97,4475.504,4478.24,I will go through them easily.,93,,
491,0.97,4478.24,4499.928,"The patrol and community based will need to take a look at different a new ways of putting together patrol models, perhaps with my organization with neighborhoods and looking at police staffing differently in order to better meet the communities expectation.",93,,
492,0.97,4499.928,4513.175,But also to address the racial disparities that not only were a component of the consent decree but also highlighted in the disparity report in 2018.,93,,
493,0.97,4513.175,4528.524,"The second one, which is transforming 911, here is really where the work related to putting together Community-Based or civilian responses where currently we have police response.",93,,
494,0.97,4528.524,4539.167,And working to coordinate a better coordination between police response and some of these things that will be created.,93,,
495,0.97,4539.167,4545.073,One of the first steps of that is putting together a new Department for the 911 center.,93,,
496,0.97,4545.073,4572.334,"And then taking a look at how the ordination of calls that come in can be Triaged in a way where there is a unified emergency communication element where a call comes in for service, it is dispatched to the appropriate entity and there is also a flow of information that goes back to the appropriate entity as well.",93,,
497,0.97,4572.334,4578.941,The next one is reforming overtime policies.,93,,
498,0.97,4578.941,4582.844,Councilmember Herbold talked about this earlier.,93,,
499,0.97,4582.844,4589.551,In 2016 the auditor did an audit looking SPD overtime.,93,,
500,0.97,4589.551,4591.853,As part of that audit there were a host of recommendations.,93,,
501,0.97,4591.853,4593.388,I believe there were 30 in total.,93,,
502,0.97,4593.388,4608.236,"A large percentage of those, SPD has been able to put into practice and there are a number of them left, many of them tied to some technology that I think was Referenced earlier.",93,,
503,0.97,4608.236,4618.58,"We may want to take a look at that, it also stressed the importance of SPD grievance takeover overtime budget.",93,,
504,0.97,4618.58,4630.058,"Part of these ideas of taking a look at how patrol Deployments are going to go, right size of the agency, what types of calls are going to be handled.",93,,
505,0.97,4630.058,4636.098,The next look at that will be what type of overtime resources are appropriate for the Department.,93,,
506,0.97,4636.098,4653.315,"Lastly, as technology and data analysis, SPD needs to continue to develop innovative ideas for technology and data and making it available.",93,,
507,0.97,4653.315,4669.364,Making a host of information available to our Dashboards and we want to continue to look at how we can put information out to make sure we are transparent and people can see the work we're doing.,93,,
508,0.97,4673.168,4678.44,I don't see any additional hands.,94,,
509,0.97,4678.44,4681.043,All right.,94,,
510,0.97,4681.043,4690.552,Jason Johnson with the human services Department.,95,,
511,0.97,4690.552,4692.154,It's good to be with you this afternoon.,95,,
512,0.97,4692.154,4700.429,"If I might, just before diving into the slide, today, October 1, against a month-long awareness campaign to end domestic violence.",95,,
513,0.97,4700.429,4713.308,"In partnership with Community- based organizations, human services Department has helped provide support services to over 10,000 households expensing domestic violence, sexual assault.",95,,
514,0.97,4713.308,4715.077,Every Thursday this month will be purple Thursday.,95,,
515,0.97,4715.077,4718.08,Today I am wearing purple.,95,,
516,0.97,4718.08,4720.115,To bring greater awareness to the impacts of domestic violence.,95,,
517,0.97,4720.115,4729.691,I invite each of you and the public to join the awareness campaign by wearing purple every Thursday throughout October.,95,,
518,0.97,4729.691,4732.561,We cannot have safe communities when people are not safe in their own homes.,95,,
519,0.97,4732.561,4733.995,It seemed appropriate to mention here.,95,,
520,0.97,4733.995,4739.668,Thank you for allowing me the short moment to highlight domestic violence awareness.,95,,
521,0.97,4739.668,4743.705,Thank you for noting that.,96,,
522,0.97,4743.705,4745.707,This is one of the rare days I'm not wearing purple.,96,,
523,0.97,4745.707,4754.015,I have my purple pen and I know Councilmember Juarez has her purple pen as well.,96,,
524,0.97,4754.015,4779.441,We will be using these purple pens to make sure we do some highlighting in the budgets for additional investments in programs and services that help prevent domestic violence . I really appreciate you highlighting that and walking us through the existing investments in the 2021 budget.,97,,
525,0.97,4779.441,4782.144,Thank you.,98,,
526,0.97,4782.144,4782.911,Back to the slides.,98,,
527,0.97,4782.911,4788.016,This first slide is an acknowledgment that many departments across the city invest in community safety.,98,,
528,0.97,4788.016,4798.793,"Below are examples from parks, Department of neighborhoods, office of civil rights, Seattle municipal court and the attorneys office.",98,,
529,0.97,4798.793,4807.469,"The human services Department has most of the community funding, roughly $21 million.",98,,
530,0.97,4807.469,4811.74,It is that funding that goes to Community-Based organizations to conduct this work.,98,,
531,0.97,4811.74,4815.076,Next flight.,98,,
532,0.97,4815.076,4837.999,"In the movement to Reimagine safety as part of community driven model, it made sense for us in the human services Department to have a safe and thriving community division.",98,,
533,0.97,4837.999,4839.568,To elevate and consolidate the departments investment.,98,,
534,0.97,4839.568,4842.604,"The work across the entire Department is either related to safety, or intertwined with it.",98,,
535,0.97,4842.604,4855.617,"When I think about the causes of violence, it goes back to things like racism, poverty, access to education and Healthcare, and family and neighborhood Dynamics.",98,,
536,0.97,4855.617,4865.327,Hst invests in organizations and programs that address these root causes and we know that people usually need to access a range of human services.,98,,
537,0.97,4865.327,4868.63,Not just one at a time.,98,,
538,0.97,4868.63,4878.94,"Well we consolidate and elevate safety as a division, it is important that we keep community safety firmly embedded in the continuum of human services.",98,,
539,0.97,4878.94,4881.142,So that we can use a whole person approach.,98,,
540,0.97,4881.142,4884.713,Next flight.,98,,
541,0.97,4884.713,4889.15,This is how the Divisio would be organized.,98,,
542,0.97,4889.15,4891.953,We took a minimalist approach here.,98,,
543,0.97,4891.953,4901.329,That means we use existing resources to create a very basic skeleton of a division.,98,,
544,0.97,4901.329,4904.833,We pulled existing funding for community safety from our youth and family apartment division into this new division.,98,,
545,0.97,4904.833,4920.615,And you will see that is the investments team . As you recall we funded 19 organizations last year to provide trauma informed care for young people involved in criminal justice.,98,,
546,0.97,4920.615,4923.485,We refer to these as our Hsd community safety investments.,98,,
547,0.97,4923.485,4931.793,Those will be pulled from into the new safe and thriving communities division.,98,,
548,0.97,4931.793,4938.199,We also pulled the Department of safety and sexual assault into that division.,98,,
549,0.97,4938.199,4944.105,Safety cannot be achieved until ending Gender-Based violence.,98,,
550,0.97,4944.105,4951.713,"This is a holding spot, it may need to be branded.",98,,
551,0.97,4951.713,4957.319,We may need to keep the domestic violence sexual assault branding for this team.,98,,
552,0.97,4957.319,4960.121,But that is Tbd at this point.,98,,
553,0.97,4960.121,4975.437,We welcome the crime survivor services from SPD who tirelessly advocate on behalf of crime survivor's so they can navigate the legal system and web of human services.,98,,
554,0.97,4975.437,4982.344,A minimal approach also means we kept to a simple structure.,98,,
555,0.97,4982.344,4983.411,That can maintain basic functions.,98,,
556,0.97,4983.411,4994.956,"A place were community would have a central point of contact, that would be the division director and the administrative assistant.",98,,
557,0.97,4994.956,4996.791,An entity that could help organize a community collective.,98,,
558,0.97,4996.791,5004.933,You will see the community liaison.,98,,
559,0.97,5004.933,5008.136,And the place were funding could land in order to be distributed to community organizations.,98,,
560,0.97,5008.136,5013.441,There you will see the policy and system coordination.,98,,
561,0.97,5013.441,5017.445,We anticipate that the community will determine how to best further build out and steer this division.,98,,
562,0.97,5017.445,5022.384,"And more importantly, it's investments.",98,,
563,0.97,5022.384,5036.064,"And, if first order of engagement will be to get community help in hiring these new roles, defining what these, further defining what these rules are, and these divisions.",98,,
564,0.97,5036.064,5041.002,Next flight.,98,,
565,0.97,5041.002,5048.009,"So, under strategies, categorized human services work into three buckets.",98,,
566,0.97,5048.009,5052.614,"Prevention, intervention.",98,,
567,0.97,5052.614,5060.021,Prevention is making sure people never experience it to begin with.,98,,
568,0.97,5060.021,5062.19,"Antipoverty, Antiracism.",98,,
569,0.97,5062.19,5067.829,"It can also mean outreach and education so people make better choices, when they are confronted with a potentially violent situation.",98,,
570,0.97,5067.829,5079.941,Intervention is for people who have already experienced violence and require trauma informed care to heal from that violence.,98,,
571,0.97,5079.941,5083.511,"And finally system court nation, that is built around a whole person approach.",98,,
572,0.97,5083.511,5089.818,We want to wrap services around an individual and build a system that is easy to navigate.,98,,
573,0.97,5089.818,5093.455,These are broad strategies that help organize the work.,98,,
574,0.97,5093.455,5105.266,"Again, we look forward to engaging with community and our community Stakeholders to develop a plan to invest in programming across the continuum.",98,,
575,0.97,5105.266,5122.884,My next slides are the budget specific--I just wonder if this is a good moment to pause and see if there any questions about the intent of this new division.,98,,
576,0.97,5122.884,5127.989,"Or Madam chair, if you would like me to go into the budget detail and take questions at the end?",98,,
577,0.97,5127.989,5131.993,Thank you.,99,,
578,0.97,5131.993,5136.898,I am not seeing any hands.,99,,
579,0.97,5136.898,5138.199,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",99,,
580,0.97,5138.199,5139.0,Thank you.,100,,
581,0.97,5139.0,5149.31,Just interested about the long- term vision for the safe and thriving communities division.,100,,
582,0.97,5149.31,5177.338,"In the resolution I referred to throughout the day the resolution the constitutes the Council's plan for Reimagining, the resolution itself calls out the interest in creating a Department of community led violence permission fourth quarter 2021.",100,,
583,0.97,5177.338,5188.816,Is there work contemplated in these community safety plans related to this possible new Department?,100,,
584,0.97,5188.816,5208.069,"That this division might become this new Department, and then Úbecome home for the Centralize home for other community safety functions that we might use outside of SPD, it is anticipated the work itself Micro?",100,,
585,0.97,5208.069,5210.138,"So, I think there's a lot to be determined.",101,,
586,0.97,5210.138,5214.776,There's a lot of potential within this division.,101,,
587,0.97,5214.776,5235.096,"As I mentioned, in my comments, I believe strongly that community safety, especially community safety investments along the human services continuum really belong in human services Department.",101,,
588,0.97,5235.096,5250.011,I think there is a good continued placement of our current investments and I think this divisional structure creates a good landing space for future investments that could come through continued community dialogue.,101,,
589,0.97,5250.011,5260.822,I do believe that this is just a really Bare-Bones basic structure that is intended to be nimble.,101,,
590,0.97,5260.822,5276.304,So if there are other aspects of community safety that the Department holds we would see them as part of this division and this divisional structure.,101,,
591,0.97,5276.304,5283.611,Especially the functional elements that are going to be up for consideration.,101,,
592,0.97,5283.611,5304.532,"Items like 911, emergency management, and those kinds of things, I think that there are, as those discussions continue, I think we will have to continue checking in and seeing if there is alignment of possibility for those to be human services efforts.",101,,
593,0.97,5304.532,5307.368,We have not done that analysis to date.,101,,
594,0.97,5307.368,5317.345,"Again, we wanted to really stand up a very simple structure of organizing around community safety that we thought made sense at this moment.",101,,
595,0.97,5317.345,5329.357,"I will say that even if no other investments come to the human services Department, I think this structure of organizing around community safety makes a lot of sense.",101,,
596,0.97,5329.357,5342.003,"Having our domestic violence investment, having our community safety investment, these are investments that work across the spectrum and space.",101,,
597,0.97,5342.003,5352.08,Having them organized together really SETS us up well to achieve our ultimate result which is creating safe communities.,101,,
598,0.97,5352.08,5363.825,"Will that is one thing we did in the 2020 budgeting, the package that you guys like, that's great.",102,,
599,0.97,5363.825,5371.132,I think director Johnson has eloquently articulated some of our thinking at this moment.,103,,
600,0.97,5371.132,5385.613,"We have a number of, as we have talked about, a number of transfers we have identified structurally, the organization on the executive side that makes sense.",103,,
601,0.97,5385.613,5391.919,"But clearly, there is a Longer- term conversation described in great detail here.",103,,
602,0.97,5391.919,5399.827,And the future stage of where this work lives is an open question that we are looking forward to continue to talk about.,103,,
603,0.97,5399.827,5412.94,"For now, as you and I both know, Hst has long had some of these core Foundational elements within its residual structure.",103,,
604,0.97,5412.94,5430.358,"At this time, this really for us, we feel strongly that this makes the most sense where this work should live and we have incredible confidence in director Johnson and his research.",103,,
605,0.97,5432.16,5433.694,I am not seeing additional comments.,104,,
606,0.97,5433.694,5434.695,If you'd like to continue.,104,,
607,0.97,5434.695,5436.197,"I will, thank you so much.",105,,
608,0.97,5436.197,5437.999,"So, back to the program budgets light.",105,,
609,0.97,5437.999,5465.226,"Once we Consolidated our safety investments and put positions in place to support the new division, we determined the division would stand up with the baseline budget . The Consolidated budgets represent funding we contracted out throughout her family empowerment division in the Mayor's office on the mystic violence and sexual assault.",105,,
610,0.97,5465.226,5471.332,Captured here . ose investments next flight.,105,,
611,0.97,5471.332,5485.479,"So on transfers to the safe communities division, Hsd has an interesting safe communities budget summary level, that is traditionally housing Gender- based violence assessment.",105,,
612,0.97,5485.479,5496.757,We will now consolidate all of our safety investments under this and the BSL will represent the new safe and thriving community's division.,105,,
613,0.97,5496.757,5500.394,"To accomplish this, we will execute three transfers.",105,,
614,0.97,5500.394,5509.67,We will move crime survivor support team listed in the org structure is the victim advocate team.,105,,
615,0.97,5509.67,5511.739,From SPD to human services.,105,,
616,0.97,5511.739,5527.788,"We will be moving budget and pockets from the navigation team, four positions, and from the youth empowerment family division to the safe and thriving community division.",105,,
617,0.97,5527.788,5538.366,"Those will make up some of the new roles and functions that exist including division direct, strategic advisors that will focus on community engagement.",105,,
618,0.97,5538.366,5549.01,"And then third, we are moving safety investments from our preparing you for success BSL into the community safety.",105,,
619,0.97,5549.01,5558.085,And just three transfers.,105,,
620,0.97,5558.085,5562.924,Councilmember Herbold.,106,,
621,0.97,5562.924,5569.196,This is more of a logistical question rather than highlight a polity dispute.,107,,
622,0.97,5569.196,5577.939,How do you transfer six Ftes from a navigation team that has zero Ftes?,107,,
623,0.97,5577.939,5603.164,"We have zeroed out the navigation team Ftes, the intention was that the money from those positions were to be spent on outreach and navigation, housing navigation services and financial services for people living unsheltered.",107,,
624,0.97,5603.164,5617.311,We understand from the correspondence we received from the Mayor that those positions have been ended from the correspondence from the Mayor yesterday.,107,,
625,0.97,5617.311,5636.097,Did not receive any indication that the Mayor intends to spend the money realized from those positions in a way that the Council required in the 2020 rebalancing.,107,,
626,0.97,5636.097,5643.971,"So again, I am despite my statement, highlighting policy disagreement.",107,,
627,0.97,5643.971,5666.927,I think it is harmful to communities to not spend those dollars to help people who are outside . and I am very concerned about the impacts to people living outside not still receiving outreach services.,107,,
628,0.97,5666.927,5673.2,"That aside, Logistically, functionally, how do you transfer Ftes from a function where there are no Ftes?",107,,
629,0.97,5673.2,5684.812,We are going to dive much deeper into this discussion tomorrow when we talk about our efforts to address homelessness.,108,,
630,0.97,5684.812,5691.252,The 2021 budget has a outreach team in the human services Department.,108,,
631,0.97,5691.252,5695.756,Eight FTE the make up that team.,108,,
632,0.97,5695.756,5703.764,And moves four positions and their funding that were formally with the navigation team into the community safety division.,108,,
633,0.97,5703.764,5714.075,Two of the six positions you mentioned will be coming from that youth family empowerment.,108,,
634,0.97,5714.075,5716.577,It's really a technical question.,109,,
635,0.97,5716.577,5719.58,I'm sorry.,109,,
636,0.97,5719.58,5725.453,It actually relates to the conversation this morning.,110,,
637,0.97,5725.453,5736.397,The budgetary actions the Council has taken this year provides funding that they do not eliminate authorized positions.,110,,
638,0.97,5736.397,5741.469,Unfunded positions can be transferred.,110,,
639,0.97,5741.469,5750.077,So the positions are what's being transferred even though it says transfer of budget and Ftes?,111,,
640,0.97,5750.077,5754.415,We proposed the 21 budget to include funding for these positions.,112,,
641,0.97,5754.415,5769.396,"The budget doesn't include request to create the positions because a position is an authorized legal thing, if you will, as a number, position numbers.",112,,
642,0.97,5769.396,5773.1,"Purely technical answer, just a technical question.",112,,
643,0.97,5773.1,5777.938,Right.,113,,
644,0.97,5777.938,5780.708,I want to pause real quick.,114,,
645,0.97,5780.708,5782.71,Other additional questions?,114,,
646,0.97,5782.71,5784.111,Thank you so much.,115,,
647,0.97,5784.111,5810.771,"If I understand what I am looking at, the crux of the issue is that the 2021 Mayor's proposed budget proposes bringing back the navigation team through funding the six FTE positions and housing them in the safe communities division administration?",115,,
648,0.97,5810.771,5817.678,That is not correct.,116,,
649,0.97,5817.678,5819.046,Help me understand.,117,,
650,0.97,5819.046,5839.2,So the six positions here that are transfers from navigation team and why Effie are the four pockets that were this year associated with the navigation too.,118,,
651,0.97,5839.2,5846.707,"Are going to be kept, they will not be Aggregated in those pockets are going to move over to the safety division.",118,,
652,0.97,5846.707,5856.483,"And in the Mayor's 2021 proposed budget, those pockets in the safety division are funded.",118,,
653,0.97,5856.483,5872.933,The navigation team is not a part of this division . This division would not House homeless outreach or have any homelessness related investments.,118,,
654,0.97,5872.933,5891.752,"This is to capture a change in where Ftes, where pockets will be in the budget and four of those pockets will be coming from the navigation team, two be coming from youth and family.",118,,
655,0.97,5891.886,5904.365,"The 900 to--$902,000, that is going to be just for funding the six Ftes or the programs?",119,,
656,0.97,5904.365,5908.669,And services funded without a money?,119,,
657,0.97,5908.669,5918.078,That is just the amount of funding that would support the Ftes in the safe and thriving communities division.,120,,
658,0.97,5918.078,5919.28,Thank you.,121,,
659,0.97,5919.28,5932.593,I wanted to just quickly say a few things about the office of domestic violence and sexual assault prevention.,121,,
660,0.97,5932.593,5951.412,"Director Johnson, I've had an opportunity to talk to you in the past about how important it is I think for us to elevate the work, they are a small and mighty division within the human services Department and they do really important and innovative work.",121,,
661,0.97,5951.412,5957.685,Is modeled on a public health harm reduction approach.,121,,
662,0.97,5957.685,5970.597,They been doing a lot of important work around thinking differently about domestic violence and really getting at the root cause to a punishment model which is what is generally used.,121,,
663,0.97,5970.597,5981.141,Even this morning we heard some rhetoric from chief Diaz about how it's important to have law enforcement around to address domestic violence.,121,,
664,0.97,5981.141,6021.181,In reality what's important is having investments in divisions like domestic violence and sexual assault office that is really looking at how to further upstream to interrupt the cycle of domestic violence to educate Batterers about how to control their own behaviors and also empowering survivors of domestic violence about how to create a safer environment how to enter into a safer environment for themselves and their families.,121,,
665,0.97,6021.181,6052.413,I am really happy to see that that is going to be memorialized in the safe communities concepts and I want to signal my early support for that and my hope that we can continue to focus a lot of attention on ways to address Gender-Based violence which right now are primarily addressed through law enforcement and I think that's a mistake to use that want tool as a solution for these issues.,121,,
666,0.97,6052.413,6065.426,Dsa is certainly creative in other ways to address those issues that don't require law enforcement response only.,121,,
667,0.97,6065.426,6075.002,Thank you so much for elevating the incredible work of her team.,122,,
668,0.97,6075.002,6077.037,You're absolutely right.,122,,
669,0.97,6077.037,6086.146,"I see so much opportunity in this restructure for that team to continue to innovate, to continue to look upstream.",122,,
670,0.97,6086.146,6106.867,"And partner with some additional resources like strategic advisors to connect the community, who can be thinking upstream and really make the most which at this point is enough Underinvestment in the domestic violence space.",122,,
671,0.97,6106.867,6111.371,I couldn't agree with you more and think you for honoring.,122,,
672,0.97,6111.371,6116.076,"Okay, I think I am at my last slide.",123,,
673,0.97,6116.076,6130.791,"On that slide, just a quick clarification, you may have mentioned this, 11 Ftes for the transfer victim advocate team, so you are maintaining the team, you're just transferring, right?",124,,
674,0.97,6130.791,6136.396,We are not eliminating Ftes?,124,,
675,0.97,6136.396,6144.404,This is just recognizing we are receiving those staff at the same level.,125,,
676,0.97,6144.404,6152.613,"Councilmember Morales, please go ahead.",126,,
677,0.97,6152.613,6159.72,I want to thank you for asking a technical question and giving a technical answer.,127,,
678,0.97,6159.72,6165.425,I appreciate learning the difference between some of these budget transfers that are happening.,127,,
679,0.97,6165.425,6170.831,I do have a question about the six Ftes.,127,,
680,0.97,6170.831,6173.734,I understand the transfer is coming from the navigation team.,127,,
681,0.97,6173.734,6177.804,"It is still not clear to me, director Johnson, with the six Ftes will be doing?",127,,
682,0.97,6177.804,6182.643,What is the role within this division?,127,,
683,0.97,6182.643,6189.816,So we can go back Maybe to the org chart?,128,,
684,0.97,6189.816,6210.27,"You will see here, I try to highlight where there is some existing pockets and did that in a way to show and not highlighting any new pocket.",128,,
685,0.97,6210.27,6228.989,"It is not showing up in the Mayor's 2021 budget--and so those pockets will be used to bring on board and education director, to bring on board and administrative assistant.",128,,
686,0.97,6228.989,6240.1,"And these two strategic advisor positions, one community liaison and one policy and system coordination.",128,,
687,0.97,6240.1,6242.169,Specialist.,128,,
688,0.97,6242.169,6255.182,The existing pockets from Yfe will be in the investment space and direct services.,128,,
689,0.97,6255.182,6260.42,That accounts for six.,128,,
690,0.97,6260.42,6260.721,Okay.,129,,
691,0.97,6260.721,6264.224,Are they necessarily a lateral transfer then?,129,,
692,0.97,6264.224,6268.195,"No, these --",130,,
693,0.97,6268.195,6269.596,Less vacation?,131,,
694,0.97,6269.596,6277.104,There might be some opportunities in the human services Department for some level of transfer.,132,,
695,0.97,6277.104,6284.444,"But, as a department we try to have open and competitive processes for all positions.",132,,
696,0.97,6284.444,6285.545,Especially new roles.,132,,
697,0.97,6285.545,6299.86,"I do expect that especially the division director, the community liaison, policy and system coordinator, those will be open, competitive Recruitments.",132,,
698,0.97,6299.86,6310.17,"And so, there is great expertise, a talent in the human services Department, so individuals currently with Hst may wind up serving in those roles.",132,,
699,0.97,6310.17,6313.373,But it could be that we hire outside folks.,132,,
700,0.97,6313.373,6316.777,Thank you.,133,,
701,0.97,6316.777,6323.85,Thank you very much Councilmember Morales.,134,,
702,0.97,6323.85,6326.186,Director Johnson I believe you have one more slide.,134,,
703,0.97,6326.186,6333.193,"This is ABS, reductions and cost savings.",135,,
704,0.97,6333.193,6334.995,The new divisions will receive additional ads.,136,,
705,0.97,6334.995,6350.877,There is $2 million in the proposed budget to embark on Participatory budgeting process with community that will determine alternative solutions to policing response.,136,,
706,0.97,6350.877,6357.184,"There is also $420,000 for community Passageways to continue their to incident response program.",136,,
707,0.97,6357.184,6366.126,"And then, there is the standard 1.9% inflationary rate that all human services contract rates receive per your ordinance.",136,,
708,0.97,6366.126,6372.599,And continuation of several Council one time ads for Gender-Based violence services.,136,,
709,0.97,6372.599,6386.813,"I wanted to just call out that there are some additional funds . I think you will see in this BSL, and I wanted to call those out specifically.",136,,
710,0.97,6386.813,6393.32,"Finally, this was discussed earlier, and it's not on the slide, but the $14 million building funding for community safety, --",136,,
711,0.97,6393.32,6394.955,You just can't get past it.,137,,
712,0.97,6394.955,6403.063,I'm glad you Unpacked you're going back to it.,137,,
713,0.97,6403.063,6418.745,"That will be managed initially . But transition to this new safe and thriving community's division, that work is being developed now to immediately get $4 million out as soon as possible.",138,,
714,0.97,6418.745,6428.088,We will be back in vacation was city council with a plan on how to get the remaining $10 million in community program contract.,138,,
715,0.97,6428.088,6430.056,"I want to let you know, I heard you.",138,,
716,0.97,6430.056,6431.691,I didn't want to forget the important note.,138,,
717,0.97,6431.691,6433.693,Thank you very much.,139,,
718,0.97,6433.693,6440.7,We appreciate that.,139,,
719,0.97,6440.7,6444.971,"As you have heard, there is a strong interest in wanting to hear more about getting those dollars out in 2020.",139,,
720,0.97,6444.971,6446.506,So that will be our first priority.,139,,
721,0.97,6446.506,6457.117,I think that will help us understand better where the Scaling up and Scaling down could potentially occur in 2021.,139,,
722,0.97,6457.117,6469.529,"Just before, I have a few more questions, I want to note for our friends at IP, I wanted to flag that in case you wanted to mute yourself or if you have something to say.",139,,
723,0.97,6469.529,6481.241,I will also note the importance of you indicating that there will be a 1.9% contract inflation allocation per the ordinance we passed.,139,,
724,0.97,6481.241,6484.744,Was that in 2018?,139,,
725,0.97,6484.744,6485.612,I'm trying to remember.,139,,
726,0.97,6485.612,6490.417,I think it was 2018 and not 2019.,139,,
727,0.97,6490.417,6491.551,"Director Johnson, do you remember?",139,,
728,0.97,6491.551,6496.122,"It was for 2019, well, that's a good question.",140,,
729,0.97,6496.122,6498.158,I think it was 2019.,140,,
730,0.97,6498.158,6500.56,It has been a long few years.,141,,
731,0.97,6500.56,6502.562,I appreciate you flagging that.,141,,
732,0.97,6502.562,6515.375,I know director noble fielded that question for me yesterday and he did indicate it was part of the proposed budget so I think that was a huge relief to some in the community had questions about that.,141,,
733,0.97,6515.375,6519.079,I want to ask one more clarifying question about that piece.,141,,
734,0.97,6519.079,6526.486,Is the Inflationry adjustment also being assumed for the contracts are going to be transferred to the new homeless response entity?,141,,
735,0.97,6526.486,6531.391,They will.,142,,
736,0.97,6531.391,6541.001,Our plan at this point is that the money that will go to the regional authority will come through the human services Department.,142,,
737,0.97,6541.001,6552.379,We will enter into a single contract with the regional authority and that contract will have the inflationary adjustment.,142,,
738,0.97,6552.379,6565.592,That is the mechanism by which we can make sure city human services contract continues to get the inflationary rate.,142,,
739,0.97,6565.592,6568.094,I know that will be a relief for many to hear.,143,,
740,0.97,6568.094,6577.304,"Folks who were not present, it was a long conversation that predates me, what we were able to accomplish ultimately was applying the inflationary adjustment almost after a 10 year period of not having those two various contracts.",143,,
741,0.97,6577.304,6592.452,"Really do appreciate director Johnson, your work to get those dollars allocated out after the passage of that bill and seeing a here reflected in this budget and in director noble's words yesterday, I think it's very reassuring.",143,,
742,0.97,6592.452,6595.822,Thank you very much.,143,,
743,0.97,6595.822,6603.33,"Colleagues, questions? I think we are at the presentation.",143,,
744,0.97,6603.33,6606.166,Are happy to go back to any of the slides you have questions on.,143,,
745,0.97,6606.166,6613.34,"Will NOTE the viewing public, our friends at the office of economic development, we had them on standby in case we have extra time.",143,,
746,0.97,6613.34,6621.448,But we will let them know we will use this last hour for the other presentation.,143,,
747,0.97,6621.448,6632.092,"We will not have them come back today, we do appreciate the time and we will field any questions they have and channel the Backend during the presentations tomorrow we will do so.",143,,
748,0.97,6632.092,6637.664,I want to make sure they knew and let them know about a half hour ago they were free to not be on standby anymore.,143,,
749,0.97,6637.664,6640.1,We appreciate the generous offer.,143,,
750,0.97,6640.1,6654.714,"Before we do Councilmember comments, I see Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Herbold, did you have anything you want to add before questions?",143,,
751,0.97,6654.714,6655.181,Not really.,144,,
752,0.97,6655.181,6668.094,"I just wanted to close by saying we have had, between this morning and this afternoon, for five hours of spirited discussion around community safety and SPD.",144,,
753,0.97,6668.094,6670.83,I think you have given us a number of things to think about.,144,,
754,0.97,6670.83,6686.446,"I hope that while enormously complex and the number of elements to the process going forward, we hope that we can find the right opportunity to work together in this entire policy space.",144,,
755,0.97,6686.446,6696.056,And we look forward to working with you and your staff more in the budget process as is helps lay the foundation for the effort going forward.,144,,
756,0.97,6696.056,6700.026,Thank you for your time.,144,,
757,0.97,6700.026,6702.529,We appreciate the words today.,145,,
758,0.97,6702.529,6704.664,"To give very much, deputy Mayor.",145,,
759,0.97,6704.664,6707.834,Councilmember Morales and then Councilmember Herbold.,146,,
760,0.97,6707.834,6715.375,"W Mayor, I think this might be a question for you.",147,,
761,0.97,6715.375,6758.518,"The last slide, director Johnson talked about another distorted budget process budgeted at about $2 million if the entire line item was for this but Tori budgeting, so I want to ask about that and I want to go back to the question I asked director Mantilla about what is the relationship or interaction between the Idt and community safety Workgroup and this equitable investment task force? How will all of those work together, to what end?",147,,
762,0.97,6758.518,6778.037,"And now seeing this line item about the separate Participatory budget process, I want to see how these all fit together and with the vision is for some outcome.",147,,
763,0.97,6778.037,6784.11,Can we go back to that slide as well.,148,,
764,0.97,6784.11,6792.652,I may call in director noble on this.,149,,
765,0.97,6792.652,6804.13,"I apologize I may have missed this when director Johnson reference the $2 million, I don't believe this has been earmarked specifically for the Participatory budgeting process.",149,,
766,0.97,6804.13,6814.174,Clearly the Council is identified $3 million of resource for Participatory budgeting.,149,,
767,0.97,6814.174,6828.855,"Director noble, clarify for me what it says in the budget, I was under the impression that this $2 Millin have been identified for actual community safety investments pending some recommendations that come out of the community safety Workgroup.",149,,
768,0.97,6828.855,6840.767,"Now that could be in very short order, that could be longer-term set of recommendations, we haven't actually pinned that down yet so to speak.",149,,
769,0.97,6840.767,6853.213,"I believe $2 million was set aside with the idea of investing in services and programs, not necessarily for a Participatory budgeting process.",149,,
770,0.97,6853.213,6875.602,"Now, having said that, depending on councils conversations and what comes out of the research work in the $3 million body of work, these dollars will be available for potential investment in specific services or programs.",149,,
771,0.97,6875.602,6885.945,I don't believe we were intending these to be used on top of the $3 million you already identified.,149,,
772,0.97,6885.945,6888.047,That's my understanding.,149,,
773,0.97,6888.047,6889.749,I look back at director Johnson.,149,,
774,0.97,6889.749,6892.151,That is absolutely right.,150,,
775,0.97,6892.151,6895.154,Maybe I'm being a little too loose with terminology.,150,,
776,0.97,6895.154,6898.691,My apologies if I caused confusion.,150,,
777,0.97,6898.691,6900.727,Absolutely right.,150,,
778,0.97,6900.727,6924.784,"It is $2 million that can be allocated, put forward, comes from community through this Workgroup, I think of that is very Participatory, we are engaged, hearing from community and things that need to be funded immediately.",150,,
779,0.97,6924.784,6932.692,Didn't mean to cause confusion.,150,,
780,0.97,6932.692,6936.095,My apologies for being a little too loose with that terminology.,150,,
781,0.97,6936.095,6989.549,"Councilmember, to your other question, I may also bring in, the beauty Mayor is with us on this call as well, but I will emphasize that the Council identified Participatory budget process research effort in the community engagement that director Mantilla identified earlier in the discussion is something we still want to engage with with you and your colleagues and legislative branch on how those two pieces, community feedback into this product process are going to work together.",151,,
782,0.97,6989.549,6991.351,I don't have an answer for you for that.,151,,
783,0.97,6991.351,6993.619,In part because I think we are still building this ourselves.,151,,
784,0.97,6993.619,7000.259,And at the same time I want to learn more about the councils Scoping of that process.,151,,
785,0.97,7000.259,7020.847,I think there is room for us to continue to refine that which is my way of saying there is still work to be done to make sure the information will feed into the Idt we have created with Internet Intentionality to center around feedback.,151,,
786,0.97,7020.847,7024.083,Policy decisions for you and the Mayor to consider.,151,,
787,0.97,7024.083,7051.911,"As far as the equitable initiative task force, I'm going to defer a little to deputy Mayor on this, given the also emphasized community led nature of that process, I am reluctant to presuppose what recommendations or policy space or strategies that process may yield.",151,,
788,0.97,7051.911,7057.316,It could very well lead to specific interests or recommendations in the same space we're talking about.,151,,
789,0.97,7057.316,7069.996,In which case presumably there would be a question about potential resources in the $100 million allocation that may be appropriate in this space.,151,,
790,0.97,7069.996,7078.137,"As that worked ash again I mentioned earlier, this work is all kind of happening concurrently if you will.",151,,
791,0.97,7078.137,7092.185,"Our hope would be there is actually a pretty tight thread, Connectivity between staff Forex might be happening to the extent that that information can help inform community conversations at various tables.",151,,
792,0.97,7092.185,7109.235,"But then, that two-way communication which is not intended to be entirely separate but at the same time, I don't know where that process or conversation may go once they start meeting?",151,,
793,0.97,7109.235,7125.284,"I may have more to add to that but it certainly, it very well could be a component of the community engagement and investment thinking in this space.",151,,
794,0.97,7125.284,7127.053,Did you want to add anything?,151,,
795,0.97,7127.053,7129.689,I can sort of round that out.,152,,
796,0.97,7129.689,7133.192,"Good afternoon, Councilmembers.",152,,
797,0.97,7133.192,7134.794,I am with the Mayor's office.,152,,
798,0.97,7134.794,7160.186,"The only thing I would add in terms of--I agree with everything, senior deputy Mayor Fong has said relating to the meeting Connectivity and thread amongst the pieces of work, the equitable communities initiative, $100 million investment, has a broader scope than just community safety.",152,,
799,0.97,7160.186,7173.399,No doubt that is going to be an important topic of discussion as a community does their work to make both focus on priorities as well as recommendations around investments.,152,,
800,0.97,7173.399,7178.638,The intention here is to also have Connectivity with the cabinet.,152,,
801,0.97,7178.638,7204.063,"Directors Johnson, and several others will be supporting that work in that way there is a way to feedback information that we are getting from that, from the community task force back to the staff working with the team so there is a continuous cycle of feedback.",152,,
802,0.97,7204.063,7214.473,"And as senior deputy Mayor Fong said, there may very well be community investment recommendations that emerge from that.",152,,
803,0.97,7214.473,7218.144,That are part of that $100 million investment.,152,,
804,0.97,7218.144,7222.381,So our goal here is to keep those conversations very tightly aligned.,152,,
805,0.97,7222.381,7249.008,"The final piece I will add is, as I said yesterday, there is a hope that the community led research that is happening this fall will continue to inform all of these different bodies of work in a way that sort of elevates those priorities that we hear from community and also the solutions we are hearing from community.",152,,
806,0.97,7249.008,7257.617,That is one way we can make sure to be able to lift up that community voice.,152,,
807,0.97,7257.617,7262.722,"Councilmember Morales, did that answer your question?",153,,
808,0.97,7262.722,7264.09,Councilmember Herbold please go ahead.,153,,
809,0.97,7264.09,7268.327,The question I had was answered.,154,,
810,0.97,7268.327,7278.237,"But, through this conversation, I do want to just respond to something that the deputy Mayor just said.",154,,
811,0.97,7278.237,7290.95,"I think it's really important to recognize that the community research process is, much broader than the traditional community safety.",154,,
812,0.97,7290.95,7306.065,"And I think, I think there is a lot more alignment about possible investments with the Mayor's $100 million than you might imagine.",154,,
813,0.97,7306.065,7319.178,"They are really focused, not just on criminal justice programs, they are talking about housing and homelessness investments.",154,,
814,0.97,7319.178,7320.579,They're talking about educational investments.,154,,
815,0.97,7320.579,7339.765,"They are talking about the kinds of upstream investments, if made in these communities which historically haven't been made in these communities, which are themselves, creating alternative to the school to jail pipeline.",154,,
816,0.97,7339.765,7359.085,I'm trying not to bristle every time I hear someone say that the scope or the breadth of the Mayor's equitable investment task force is much broader than what the community research project is.,154,,
817,0.97,7359.085,7362.088,I don't think it is.,154,,
818,0.97,7362.088,7364.123,So Maybe that is a place where we can start.,154,,
819,0.97,7364.123,7375.334,To take a look at the breadth of investments that the community research project is looking at.,154,,
820,0.97,7375.334,7384.143,So that on the Mayor's side of things you can have sort of a better understanding of where there might be possible funding.,154,,
821,0.97,7384.143,7405.264,"Councilmember, I should be clear and on the record, I never said--in fact yesterday I did say I thought there was tremendous opportunity for the community research work to inform the broader work of the task force because of that alignment.",155,,
822,0.97,7405.264,7417.576,What I was Referencing here is a specific question around community safety and how that will be addressed as part of the task force worked.,155,,
823,0.97,7417.576,7425.684,And I was only meant to respond to that which is the task force is going to be broader than community safety.,155,,
824,0.97,7425.684,7428.154,They're going to be looking at upstream investments.,155,,
825,0.97,7428.154,7441.066,I think both the community research work happening this fall as well as the work happening through the task force are complementary and can inform each other.,155,,
826,0.97,7441.066,7441.901,Okay.,156,,
827,0.97,7441.901,7452.778,But the community research project is not focused only on community safety.,156,,
828,0.97,7452.778,7453.712,I understand that.,157,,
829,0.97,7453.712,7462.988,"When I heard you say broader than community safety, what I thought you were saying was broader than the community safety type projects that the community reinvestment.",158,,
830,0.97,7462.988,7465.724,I have heard that before from other people.,158,,
831,0.97,7465.724,7472.097,"So if I assumed that was what you were saying as well, I apologize.",158,,
832,0.97,7472.097,7477.603,"Councilmember Herbold, I don't think there is a need to apologize.",159,,
833,0.97,7477.603,7482.741,I heard the same thing.,159,,
834,0.97,7482.741,7484.577,"Deputy Mayor, I think that was helpful clarification.",159,,
835,0.97,7484.577,7496.055,"I guess the question that remains in my mind is, why do we not then have a system that is waiting for the results of the community led research project?",159,,
836,0.97,7496.055,7503.262,"That is going to be underway very soon, to have that information to feed into what executive would like to do.",159,,
837,0.97,7503.262,7519.678,"Yesterday and this morning we were talking about not only the fact we want to be efficient in all of our time and resources at the city, but the fact that we are asking so much of community who have other jobs and obligations, we want to be conscious and respectful of the time.",159,,
838,0.97,7519.678,7528.787,Why not wait until that community led research project comes up with recommendations to then begin the process the Mayor has envisioned?,159,,
839,0.97,7528.787,7536.095,Thank you for that question.,160,,
840,0.97,7536.095,7565.024,"Yesterday high-level Timeline, the work of the task force, and again, they will determine their own priorities, based on how they organize themselves and Timelines, but if the anticipated Timeline were to come up with initial recommendations around focus areas, so not investments themselves, but focus areas, was going to be somewhere around the end of the year.",160,,
841,0.97,7565.024,7576.635,"That I am presuming, based on what has been shared publicly, alliance with the work that is anticipated to happen this fall.",160,,
842,0.97,7576.635,7578.037,Related to community research.,160,,
843,0.97,7578.037,7581.84,The community research project.,160,,
844,0.97,7581.84,7584.31,So I don't think those Timelines are in opposition to each other.,160,,
845,0.97,7584.31,7608.567,"There is work that needs to happen, both in terms of work that we will need to support this task force, just in terms of grounding them on city programs and other supplemental work that needs to happen, but also they will be doing--they will be doing their own engagement in their communities, right?",160,,
846,0.97,7608.567,7612.571,"So again, I think that they are complementary.",160,,
847,0.97,7612.571,7622.081,And mindful of the Timelines and I think this is something task force will consider as part of their work of how it Aligns with the community research work that is already underway.,160,,
848,0.97,7622.081,7631.69,And hopefully there is some good synergy there that will eventually inform recommendations that won't happen until spring of next year.,160,,
849,0.97,7631.69,7642.267,I think this could be aligned.,160,,
850,0.97,7642.267,7645.27,"Thank you, deputy Mayor.",161,,
851,0.97,7645.27,7655.214,I don't see anyone else raising her hand.,162,,
852,0.97,7655.214,7656.749,I have a few follow-up questions.,162,,
853,0.97,7656.749,7660.519,Maybe one or two more minutes and then we will turn over to SMC.,162,,
854,0.97,7660.519,7672.931,"In terms of the Idt, I am wondering, we have received notification that the Rsji sent a letter with concerns from the human rights Commission.",162,,
855,0.97,7672.931,7679.738,I am wondering how those concerns from the human rights Commission have been factored into the decision to move forward on this?,162,,
856,0.97,7679.738,7700.159,"And also, I am less familiar with this rule that the Council instituted a process for the criminal legal system alignment in the fall of last year, sorry, in the fall last year, to avoid repetitive or Overburdening task force.",162,,
857,0.97,7700.159,7708.067,How will that work of the criminal legal system align with the built into the concept of building this Idt?,162,,
858,0.97,7708.067,7713.872,Could you answer both the Rsji and the concerns about overlapping strategies within the city?,162,,
859,0.97,7713.872,7718.777,"Madam chair, I will defer to my team.",163,,
860,0.97,7718.777,7725.517,"I am not actually, I have not actually seen that letter as of yet that you are Referencing.",163,,
861,0.97,7725.517,7734.093,Was that specifically to the formation of the Eo that we discussed earlier today?,163,,
862,0.97,7734.093,7735.327,Or is it Referencing something else?,163,,
863,0.97,7735.327,7738.297,"I don't think it was from the Eo, I will double check.",164,,
864,0.97,7738.297,7756.115,"I am not sure what that references, I will ask my team right now that is here, if anyone has any specific response to that, if not then we will circle back.",165,,
865,0.97,7756.115,7761.52,"This is Julie, I think I can kind of answer that question.",166,,
866,0.97,7761.52,7773.098,So the human rights Commission saw an early draft of the Eo it didn't contain the full context of the Idt working in concert with the Workgroup.,166,,
867,0.97,7773.098,7784.042,And I think their big concern was that OCR wasn't on the Idt.,166,,
868,0.97,7784.042,7791.55,We Reworked the Eo to provide full context of how the Idt really fits in with the Workgroup which is Cochaired by the office of civil rights.,166,,
869,0.97,7791.55,7797.456,I think that was one of their primary concerns.,166,,
870,0.97,7797.456,7803.929,They did have more but that was one of our responses to one of their concerns.,166,,
871,0.97,7803.929,7808.267,The other thing we did was make sure to specifically Callout consultation with the different commissions as subject matter experts.,166,,
872,0.97,7808.267,7815.741,So we did adjust the Eo in those two ways in response to what we heard from the civil rights Commission.,166,,
873,0.97,7815.741,7816.942,"Okay, that is helpful.",167,,
874,0.97,7816.942,7851.276,"Great, on your other point, Madam chair, certainly again, with director Lockhart's engagement as part of Cochairs of the community safety Workgroup, and my comment at the beginning of the presentation which is we fully recognize that we have created a body of work here specifically related to the SPD reforms, potential investment, future investment, engagement process.",168,,
875,0.97,7851.276,7856.114,But that by no means finishes the various tables that have been set.,168,,
876,0.97,7856.114,7862.087,Specifically the legal system reform that has been happening for some time.,168,,
877,0.97,7862.087,7867.626,Council President Gonzalez mentioned the same body of work earlier.,168,,
878,0.97,7867.626,7871.73,We have every intention of continuing to engage on multiple tracks.,168,,
879,0.97,7871.73,7896.655,"In some ways it illustrates just how we have both very specific elements related to SPD and then the concentric circles out from there that tie in a whole host of other issues that include jail reform, many other criminal legal system efforts underway.",168,,
880,0.97,7896.655,7910.068,"As far as, I can give you the precise details of how that integration will happen, but I assure you, those issues are on the radar and will be part of the conversation.",168,,
881,0.97,7910.068,7912.571,Thank you so much.,169,,
882,0.97,7912.571,7932.591,"My last question getting back to the numbers, I am sure director noble highlighted this yesterday, but can you remind us what the total dollar amount is for the total budget for managing the task force and does this include compensation for the participants?",169,,
883,0.97,7932.591,7944.87,So I think the question earlier came up in the context of the U.N. resource allocation for community engagement efforts.,170,,
884,0.97,7944.87,7948.507,But as far as--I'm sorry.,170,,
885,0.97,7948.507,7955.013,Are you Referencing the equity Equable initiative task force?,170,,
886,0.97,7955.013,7964.356,I will defer back to director Mantilla and deputy Ranganathan.,170,,
887,0.97,7964.356,7967.626,"A question about the criminal justice work, and the feedback from the Cohort.",171,,
888,0.97,7967.626,7973.932,That will be integrated into the community worker.,171,,
889,0.97,7973.932,7984.509,Confirming with director Lockhart about that to make sure there is a good coordination of that outreach and understanding how that is informing the broader process.,171,,
890,0.97,7984.509,7995.854,"In terms of your other question, we are in the process of putting out requests for qualifications for a Facilitator for the task force itself.",171,,
891,0.97,7995.854,8005.23,Part of the budget as well is the anticipation there will be paid participation throughout the entirety of the process.,171,,
892,0.97,8005.23,8008.667,We have resources we are ready to allocate towards that.,171,,
893,0.97,8008.667,8013.572,"We Logistically have to figure out how we would do that, organizations versus individuals.",171,,
894,0.97,8013.572,8018.076,Our intent is to make sure there is participation.,171,,
895,0.97,8018.076,8028.086,"So there is not a specific line item, it's embedded within your Department overall budget, is that accurate?",172,,
896,0.97,8028.086,8042.1,"Yeah, there was about $500,000 allocated in the 2020 budget where we will be drawing both the Facilitation contract and also for the paid participation as well as other interpretation needs as well.",173,,

925,0.97,8162.587,8168.093,I'm excited to hear more about the initial conversation we had earlier this week.,183,,
926,0.97,8168.093,8180.105,"Great news to share I think on your end, I'm sure we have a few questions today, Councilmember Herbold if you would like to make some opening comments that would be wonderful.",183,,
927,0.97,8180.105,8185.21,I am not seeing Councilmember Herbold.,184,,
928,0.97,8185.21,8186.845,Sorry about that.,185,,
929,0.97,8186.845,8192.05,I am here.,186,,
930,0.97,8192.05,8196.755,"Briefly, my opening comments are, mostly in a way thanks.",186,,
931,0.97,8196.755,8207.465,I have been Uplifting the recent work coming out of Seattle municipal court over the last few months.,186,,
932,0.97,8207.465,8220.745,"The Institute of justice recently released a report in July, this report was commissioned by the court evaluating the courts services.",186,,
933,0.97,8220.745,8241.533,Just a few weeks ago in early September in response to the report recommendation presiding judge Gregory issued a new to require personal Recognizance release for nearly all Non-Dui defendants.,186,,
934,0.97,8241.533,8249.507,The bail reform can group from 2018 reviewed new strategies and helped lay the foundation for these new policies.,186,,
935,0.97,8249.507,8257.616,I want to recognize that work from the only days.,186,,
936,0.97,8257.616,8276.534,"And, also the work of the bail reform group met an impasse, I think the fact that the court commissioned this report study really helped to break that impasse.",186,,
937,0.97,8276.534,8296.121,And point the direction of working to make sure that we are not detaining people who we do not need to be detaining because they are neither a flight risk nor a risk to themselves or other people.,186,,
938,0.97,8296.121,8305.063,"Related to this, the court has announced recently they will be decreasing their 2021 probation budget by 25%.",187,,
939,0.97,8305.063,8313.171,Rather than relying on probation services for cases that don't require it.,187,,
940,0.97,8313.171,8323.682,They will instead collaborate with organizations to be filled community based intervention where judges can refer individuals to obtain local support and services.,187,,
941,0.97,8323.682,8330.388,"Again, this is a change that has been called on by community for years.",187,,
942,0.97,8330.388,8335.894,"Notably, the budget for justice in 2018 and again in 2019.",187,,
943,0.97,8335.894,8369.427,"And so, they were, community members were again on the cutting edge of calling for these changes in probation policies as well as funding for probation services to overly monitor people who would do better if they were working with support organizations in their own communities.",187,,
944,0.97,8369.427,8373.631,"Under state law, domestic violence and Dui cases will still require probation intervention.",187,,
945,0.97,8373.631,8383.541,"For that reason the funding, there is still funding in the court budget for some probation supervision.",187,,
946,0.97,8383.541,8390.115,I want to also uplift the Seattle office for civil rights and their report.,187,,
947,0.97,8390.115,8398.323,On an analysis of court proposed monetary sanctions and Seattle municipal court.,187,,
948,0.97,8398.323,8403.728,It details the disproportionate impacts of legal financial obligations on people of color in Seattle.,187,,
949,0.97,8403.728,8414.939,"I haven't had an opportunity to have very many committee things this year but I made sure that one of the few committee meetings I had this year, I was able to hear the report.",187,,
950,0.97,8414.939,8422.447,It was presented by Alexis Harris and Frank Edwards.,187,,
951,0.97,8422.447,8449.507,"Really, again, I don't know who was in response to the reports and recommendations, or just happy Serendipity, but last week, support judges announced they would laminate all discretionary fines and fees imposed in cases representing another court wide commitment to lessen barriers and increase equity in the system.",187,,
952,0.97,8449.507,8458.416,"We know that probation records, check fees can be $600 and higher for just one person.",187,,
953,0.97,8458.416,8471.496,"We know that more that, 1000 individuals per year are expected to be help by these changes.",187,,
954,0.97,8471.496,8472.797,And community court is starting up again.,187,,
955,0.97,8472.797,8484.809,"We had it many years ago that was begun under the former city attorney, it was suspended in part because criminal justice reform advocates are very critical of the model that Seattle was using at the time.",187,,
956,0.97,8484.809,8488.913,Where participants had to waive the constitutional rights to a trial to participate.,187,,
957,0.97,8488.913,8502.627,But this new community court provides free trial justice for participating individuals to be merely released into custody while maintaining the constitutional trial rights.,187,,
958,0.97,8502.627,8508.166,We think this might be the only such model in the nation.,187,,
959,0.97,8508.166,8517.275,Where people are able to maintain their constitutional trial rights and participate in community court and criminal history is also not a barrier to program entry.,187,,
960,0.97,8517.275,8525.884,"These are tremendous steps forward in municipal court reform and I really want to thank the judges for their action, their commitment to reevaluating our systems.",187,,
961,0.97,8525.884,8537.195,"Again, I want to thank folks have been in the trenches outside of the system for years wishing us to make changes like the ones we are making now.",187,,
962,0.97,8537.195,8538.596,Thank you.,187,,
963,0.97,8538.596,8541.866,Good afternoon.,188,,

971,0.97,8569.861,8577.235,As presiding judge I have challenged the judges and staff to transform themselves into an Equable court.,188,,
972,0.97,8577.235,8585.743,Where individuals leave better than when they enter a court and everyone is treated with dignity and feels that they were heard.,188,,
973,0.97,8585.743,8592.116,"The drivers are prolonged change, and Re-Guiding principles.",188,,
974,0.97,8592.116,8596.521,"Number one, you're going to engage the community to guide our court programs.",188,,
975,0.97,8596.521,8603.461,"Number two, we will eliminate this proportional impacts upon black, indigenous and people of color.",188,,
976,0.97,8603.461,8608.733,"And number three, collaborate with our Stakeholders to transform the system and improve outcomes.",188,,
977,0.97,8608.733,8616.374,At Seattle municipal court we acknowledge our role in inequity and the ongoing struggles people of color face in the criminal legal system.,188,,
978,0.97,8616.374,8624.082,We commit to authentic community engagement focused on community based solutions.,188,,
979,0.97,8624.082,8638.963,"All of that, we also, as was stated earlier, made all warrants issued on community court eligible charges, Non-Dv and Non-Dui will be eligible for personal Recognizance release.",188,,
980,0.97,8638.963,8641.599,People will not sit in jail for low-level misdemeanor warrants.,188,,
981,0.97,8641.599,8648.973,Eliminated all discretion will criminal fees including probation fees.,188,,
982,0.97,8648.973,8659.317,"We look forward to working with the Council, the Mayor, and system Stakeholders as well as our diverse communities to create a new just him system justice system for all.",188,,
983,0.97,8659.317,8663.721,Our proposed budget will further our commitment for legal system reforms in several ways.,188,,
984,0.97,8663.721,8673.231,"Number one, we will transform probation services, decrease budget control level by 25%.",188,,
985,0.97,8673.231,8676.0,That is in alignment with the recommendation from the Institute.,188,,
986,0.97,8676.0,8686.344,We are going to focus are smaller structured probation on case management for statutorily mandated mystic violence and driving under the influence cases.,188,,
987,0.97,8686.344,8688.546,And critical mental health court clients.,188,,
988,0.97,8688.546,8697.121,"For all other charge types, reform pretrial justice beginning with Seattle community court, which the court is very proud of.",188,,
989,0.97,8697.121,8711.969,"This is a collaborative approach that includes the city attorney, public defense, to reduce system based on.",188,,
990,0.97,8711.969,8719.043,And number four we will collaborate with organizations to build a future Community- based intervention system where judges can refer individuals to obtain critical support services.,188,,
991,0.97,8719.043,8732.09,At this time I will ask our administrative assistant to go through our budget.,188,,
992,0.97,8732.09,8736.561,"Thank you Madam chair, Madam vice chair and Madame President as well as the full council.",189,,
993,0.97,8736.561,8740.665,I am here to talk about the numbers.,189,,
994,0.97,8740.665,8752.176,The courts 2021 proposed budget is approximately $38.4 million.,189,,
995,0.97,8752.176,8753.845,Is judge Gregory shared we are making several changes.,189,,
996,0.97,8753.845,8757.715,I'd like to talk about them in context of the budget in the next few slides.,189,,
997,0.97,8757.715,8759.217,"Next slide, please.",189,,
998,0.97,8759.217,8782.94,"So the first is a reduction, Councilmember Herbold has already stole my thunder on this, but, this reduction of probation services for the programs and services division is a $1.4 million reduction, or a meaningful 25% reduction of the probation budget.",189,,
999,0.97,8782.94,8820.545,"As has already been talked about, in 2019 we independently sought an evaluation from the Vera Institute of justice, a national leading criminal justice reform nonprofit organization out of New York, and as judge Gregory highlighted, as well as vice chair her bold, the reduction responds to the Vera Institute.",189,,
1000,0.97,8820.545,8828.886,"We are reserving probation for Dv, Dui and mental health court clients.",189,,
1001,0.97,8828.886,8838.062,And therefore we are likely to have a smaller portion of people charged with Misdemeanors in our city on probation.,189,,
1002,0.97,8838.062,8846.704,We are collaborating and engaging with the community to identify interventions that support the needs of justice involved persons.,189,,
1003,0.97,8846.704,8852.61,This includes restorative healing circles.,189,,
1004,0.97,8852.61,8857.982,"We completed a court user survey, we had focus groups, and then Stakeholder listening sessions.",189,,
1005,0.97,8857.982,8873.531,We have also engaged with OCR in recent Communityengagement and are looking forward to participating in the work with city council.,189,,
1006,0.97,8873.531,8879.337,We are realigning our pretrial staffing and services to allow for the expansion of community court.,189,,
1007,0.97,8879.337,8887.211,And then we are phasing out our data reporting program by the end of this year.,189,,
1008,0.97,8887.211,8898.956,"Just so Council is aware, we have suspended the operations of date reporting since March because of the Covid safety precautions.",189,,
1009,0.97,8898.956,8907.331,"Next slide, please .'s next slide is an ad that came out of conversations recently with the Mayor's office.",189,,
1010,0.97,8907.331,8910.534,It is to connect community court clients with agencies.,189,,
1011,0.97,8910.534,8914.572,"It is a one-time pilot funding of $100,000.",189,,
1012,0.97,8914.572,8949.573,"The funding would support the relaunched community court via a social worker, a contract social worker, who would be embedded within our community resource center . and specifically I would note, we will work with a nonprofit to provide culturally appropriate case management services and make referrals to community based agencies to support the client with the goal of Self- sufficiency outside the court, outside the criminal legal system.",189,,
1013,0.97,8949.573,8954.612,"Next slide, please.",189,,
1014,0.97,8954.612,8956.414,Two reductions I will briefly mention.,189,,
1015,0.97,8956.414,8965.723,We are also this year proposing to eliminate a vacant information technology position.,189,,
1016,0.97,8965.723,8970.895,"We have the case management replacement process, the 2.0 project.",189,,
1017,0.97,8970.895,8974.532,We know our technology division will look different once the project is live.,189,,
1018,0.97,8974.532,8982.44,We believe we can start making the court technology division look different by aggregating this position.,189,,
1019,0.97,8982.44,8986.944,And the work can be absorbed by existing staff and the current project team.,189,,
1020,0.97,8986.944,8995.82,"And then we are also wanting to reduce our computer equipment line item for $260,000.",189,,
1021,0.97,8995.82,9000.124,That would be reducing purchases from general fund.,189,,
1022,0.97,9000.124,9008.933,We would temporarily use trial court improvement funding for replacing that equipment.,189,,
1023,0.97,9008.933,9018.843,I would also NOTE here that we would need Council support to approve using the funds in this manner through the third or fourth supplemental budget process.,189,,
1024,0.97,9018.843,9024.682,Next flight.,190,,
1025,0.97,9024.682,9038.095,"So the rest of the budget changes are those technical adjustments, $3.1 million rate adjustments for FAS, Seattle I.T., Seattle hr, insurance.",190,,
1026,0.97,9038.095,9040.097,"$652,000 for Awi.",190,,
1027,0.97,9040.097,9048.672,"And then a reduction of $27,000 for the central cost.",190,,
1028,0.97,9048.672,9058.215,I will now turn the floor over to Carol Bell our senior probation manager to speak on the slides related to racial equity.,190,,
1029,0.97,9058.215,9058.816,Carol?,190,,
1030,0.97,9058.816,9063.12,"Thank you very much, Beth.",191,,
1031,0.97,9063.12,9065.923,"I want to say, how excited we are about those changes that were made.",191,,
1032,0.97,9065.923,9077.301,"I know you mentioned Councilmember Herbold stole your thunder, it's really exciting to have third-party Validators for the important work you're doing.",191,,
1033,0.97,9077.301,9081.739,It's important to see those pieces and then to have you walk us through the racial equity.,191,,
1034,0.97,9081.739,9083.14,Thank you.,191,,
1035,0.97,9083.14,9087.244,Thank you.,192,,
1036,0.97,9087.244,9088.846,It's funny because I was thinking the same thing.,192,,
1037,0.97,9088.846,9089.713,She stole my thunder.,192,,
1038,0.97,9089.713,9099.657,"But like you said, I guess it's exciting for us to know that we are in alignment with the weight we are seeing things in the direction we are moving in.",192,,
1039,0.97,9099.657,9121.979,It is really important for the court and more specifically for programs and services that you know that we are being very intentional about our use of the remaining resources that we have in ensuring that we are using a racial equity plan has meaningful community engagement as we state to Reimagine what our goal is in public safety.,192,,
1040,0.97,9121.979,9134.792,The very evaluation of probation services identified some desperate impacts on black and female probation clients.,192,,
1041,0.97,9134.792,9138.762,It identified ways to provide marketable case management and reduce overall system involvement.,192,,
1042,0.97,9138.762,9143.567,We believe this is going to be realized in a few different ways.,192,,
1043,0.97,9143.567,9156.514,"We're going to start bite shifting to a Goal-Based supervision approach, focusing on short-term system engagement and really Aligning clients with treatment needs and Community-Based supportive services.",192,,
1044,0.97,9156.514,9168.893,We are going to ensure that we make meaningful client engagement and interaction and that we use incentives for early release from probation.,192,,
1045,0.97,9168.893,9181.539,"For those placed on probation, the judges have committed to invoke conditions that respond to the risk and encourage social behaviors.",192,,
1046,0.97,9181.539,9194.451,We are going to be engaging community organizations and individuals with lived experience in other identified Stakeholders to make sure we reduce any race or gender inequity in our model.,192,,
1047,0.97,9194.451,9241.298,"Now, just really looking at where we are with people of color, we saw that Disproportionality in the charges with low-level Misdemeanors . with the new community court model, we have been able to see or were hoping to see a reduced level of system involvement as it really speaks to address racial Disproportionality and allows the individuals with low-level Misdemeanors to be released from jail right away and we're looking at individuals that have had criminal history not have that interfere with any of their opportunities for this program.",192,,
1048,0.97,9241.298,9252.61,"When we kind of look at the numbers, for community court eligible cases in July 2020, 26% adult individuals were identified as black.",192,,
1049,0.97,9252.61,9264.822,The diversion program of community court is to support the immediate release and instead connect individuals to critical services.,192,,
1050,0.97,9264.822,9292.016,To increase the effectiveness of this model we will be working with Community-Based agencies alluded to earlier to provide a social worker that is culturally competent to ensure these individuals have the proper level of engagement long after their involvement with the court.,192,,
1051,0.97,9292.016,9302.559,Another thing we are looking at is where we are with the day reporting program.,192,,
1052,0.97,9302.559,9311.268,"As is been shared in prior conversations, we are phasing out the day reporting program as it is currently designed.",192,,
1053,0.97,9311.268,9318.042,We signed some more research that really this was Inequitably Impacting people of color.,192,,
1054,0.97,9318.042,9334.058,"And some of our data from 2018 we saw that 34% of those reporting were black, 7% higher than the overall percentage of black individuals charged at Seattle misses municipal court.",192,,
1055,0.97,9334.058,9349.473,This program is typically served low income high need individuals and frequent in person reporting and have high barriers that have been identified as having barriers to success.,192,,
1056,0.97,9349.473,9356.08,Completion rate overall for date reporting we found to be pretty low.,192,,
1057,0.97,9356.08,9357.214,Only 22%.,192,,
1058,0.97,9357.214,9365.522,"With this in mind, we decided it was time to redesign the program.",192,,
1059,0.97,9365.522,9383.841,"One of the things we are doing, or we started doing earlier this year is really phasing out the traditional day reporting model or individuals had to come in on a daily basis and started instituting things like text reminders, phone reporting and other modified reporting models.",192,,
1060,0.97,9383.841,9399.256,"By years end, the day reporting program will be phased out and fully replaced . We are already Tarting to see some of Thes individuals being supported by our new support program.",192,,
1061,0.97,9399.256,9421.979,Beginning this fall we will also be working with the Harvard Kennedy school of government to look at national rail reform and we're going to be participating in a project to further reduce disproportionate impact in the bail decision-making . Judge Gregory can share more with you about that.,192,,
1062,0.97,9421.979,9435.893,"Judge Gregory, we also have a question from Councilmember Herbold . would be helpful if we had Councilmember Herbold's question and maybe you can address that in your comments?",193,,
1063,0.97,9435.893,9439.863,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",193,,
1064,0.97,9439.863,9441.098,Thank you so much.,194,,
1065,0.97,9441.098,9444.034,This is a continuation of the conversation we began a few days ago.,194,,
1066,0.97,9444.034,9449.673,As it relates specifically to day reporting.,194,,
1067,0.97,9449.673,9465.022,"When we talked about the population that day reporting serves, one of the points that was made like it's been made today is that you are shifting to other ways of serving this particular population.",194,,
1068,0.97,9465.022,9488.312,"And you named text reminders as one of those new strategies but we've also acknowledged that is not effective for many of the folks that use day reporting because a lot of those folks don't have phones, it's a high homeless population.",194,,
1069,0.97,9488.312,9502.059,And not everybody has phones or phones that receive texts.,194,,
1070,0.97,9502.059,9533.957,"I'm just wondering, given that the program itself is intended give an alternative to increase the likelihood that the folks fulfill their legal obligations, and given this Disproportionality associated with the program, was there consideration to eliminating the sanction?",194,,
1071,0.97,9533.957,9541.865,"Still offering the service and still offering the help, but removing the sanction?",194,,
1072,0.97,9541.865,9548.205,"Others in FTA if you don't show up to day reporting, --",194,,
1073,0.97,9548.205,9552.809,"You are right, you are on the right track of where we are going.",195,,
1074,0.97,9552.809,9566.623,"Like we said, we are doing is really Reimagining the program remaining in removing the component of having them come in every day.",195,,
1075,0.97,9566.623,9567.891,Looking at ways of engaging them.,195,,
1076,0.97,9567.891,9581.238,One of the ways we have identified bringing them over and introducing them to the courts resource center.,195,,
1077,0.97,9581.238,9583.307,Making resources available for them to check in with us.,195,,
1078,0.97,9583.307,9584.541,But not requiring them.,195,,
1079,0.97,9584.541,9590.948,And then allowing them to sign up for the text reminder program if they do have a cell phone.,195,,
1080,0.97,9590.948,9599.523,A lot of people have been able to sign up with cell phones that were issued through the federally funded program.,195,,
1081,0.97,9599.523,9610.467,"And some of those cell phones, they would have minutes for them to make phone calls but they continue to Reef test receive text messages.",195,,
1082,0.97,9610.467,9627.985,"Even during the time of Covid, find a way to keep some of the doors of the court open for individuals who are homeless and were not able to be reached via phone or text and still have the opportunity for them to come in maybe once a week.",195,,
1083,0.97,9627.985,9634.658,We're looking at other ways to check in so it's not a burden on people.,195,,
1084,0.97,9634.658,9636.693,Especially if they are low income and still working.,195,,
1085,0.97,9636.693,9640.764,That was one of the populations we were concerned about.,195,,
1086,0.97,9640.764,9644.101,We didn't want to pull people away from employment having to come in and checking in person.,195,,
1087,0.97,9644.101,9665.389,"If we can do text reminder and support them in that way, overall day reporting structure, we are eliminating that and bringing these opportunities under our pretrial services umbrella and looking at different ways of connecting with people to meet them and their needs.",195,,
1088,0.97,9665.389,9676.933,"Another thing we looked at too, the major reason was so people could show up to court, we find out the people not showing up for day reporting showing up for court.",196,,
1089,0.97,9676.933,9687.711,"The items Carol is talking about, trying to create those items so we can make sure people show up for court and have the cases handled as soon as possible.",196,,
1090,0.97,9687.711,9692.349,We are looking at different items different ways to make sure people can shop for court and not get warrants and that sanction.,196,,
1091,0.97,9692.349,9704.161,"I guess the answer is, we have looked at that but we have other things we can do to make sure people show up for court and don't get warrants placed on them.",196,,
1092,0.97,9704.161,9714.871,One of the big benefits we have with our day reporting program is we had it with the court resource center and we noticed sometimes individuals would come in for the resources and we would constantly have them engaged in that way.,197,,
1093,0.97,9714.871,9725.282,One thing we will continue to do is have pretrial services paired with the court resource center and getting individuals in here and getting individuals resources that way.,197,,
1094,0.97,9725.282,9729.553,Just a little bit about the Harvard University study.,198,,
1095,0.97,9729.553,9743.567,"That is a three-year project, that is working with courts across the United States and it's going to identify interventions--excuse me, pretrial.",198,,
1096,0.97,9743.567,9750.273,Or at the release decision point.,198,,
1097,0.97,9750.273,9753.11,All Seattle court judges and magistrates have agreed to participate in the study.,198,,
1098,0.97,9753.11,9755.512,I want to give you a little more of that.,198,,
1099,0.97,9755.512,9786.409,"One thing I'm very pleased about, you talked about this, I want to address it again, the court has eliminated all discretion will fees in kernel cases that includes supervision fees, record check fees, or crew and community service set up fee, and as has been stated, probation and record check fees can up to $640.",198,,
1100,0.97,9786.409,9789.246,We expect this to benefit about 1000 people per year.,198,,
1101,0.97,9789.246,9791.248,A nice reduction for people.,198,,
1102,0.97,9791.248,9802.325,"And, it's going to be a reduction of $268,000, that is going to go to the city general fund.",198,,
1103,0.97,9802.325,9808.465,I like to talk more about our diverse workplace.,198,,
1104,0.97,9808.465,9815.472,"Designate funding for race and social justice, training trial court staff.",198,,
1105,0.97,9815.472,9819.075,Judges and magistrates have attended training.,198,,

1108,0.97,9842.866,9847.204,"We all know a diverse workforce is much better, especially for anyone you deal with in Seattle or any other city.",198,,
1109,0.97,9847.204,9850.507,"I'm very proud of our staff, by the way.",198,,
1110,0.97,9850.507,9853.21,"Thank you, a quick pause.",199,,
1111,0.97,9853.21,9856.079,We have a question from Councilmember Lewis.,199,,
1112,0.97,9856.079,9859.716,"Thank you, Madam chair.",200,,
1113,0.97,9859.716,9860.917,And thank you judge Gregory.,200,,
1114,0.97,9860.917,9866.99,I want to go back to the slide on the court fees.,200,,
1115,0.97,9866.99,9876.633,"First off, based on my prior work, I think this is great.",200,,
1116,0.97,9876.633,9878.268,I'm really excited to see this from the court.,200,,
1117,0.97,9878.268,9886.209,It's going to make a big difference in this is been in practice before so it's good to start making it an overall policy.,200,,
1118,0.97,9886.209,9898.622,"My question is, I know there are other fees that are established in state law in the revised code of Washington that the court will likely need to assess and are mandatory.",200,,
1119,0.97,9898.622,9910.467,"I believe there are also fees, as I recollect, that are set in the Seattle municipal code.",200,,
1120,0.97,9910.467,9925.348,"I'm just flagging, we don't have to go into that now, here, because I'm not aware of the whole universe of what those fees are, but I know there are some to take discretion away from the court or at least very much limit the discretion of the court.",200,,
1121,0.97,9925.348,9946.269,"I want to flag now that I would be interested to hear from you and your team and analysis of those mandated fees that are set in the Seattle will court and whether there might be some scope to expand on this and potentially is a Council, amend some of those fees that remove discretion from the court to possibly build on this work.",200,,
1122,0.97,9946.269,9951.508,I wanted to flag that.,200,,
1123,0.97,9951.508,9957.881,I think that could be a great area of partnership between the court and the Council.,200,,
1124,0.97,9957.881,9964.12,We do have a team looking at the fees.,201,,
1125,0.97,9964.12,9965.722,But it would take legislative change.,201,,
1126,0.97,9965.722,9970.593,To do that.,201,,
1127,0.97,9970.593,9983.106,"I was actually going to say the same thing, we are taking a look at that but we can take a further look at that and get back to you all.",202,,
1128,0.97,9983.106,9999.055,"If that gets Aggregated, Judge Gregory, into a report or something like that, of fees that would require legislative changes that we as a city council could do, I'm very much interested in taking a look at that and working for legislative fixes with the board.",203,,
1129,0.97,9999.055,10007.364,"Councilmember Lewis, that information is in the study from doctor Harris, I can send it to you.",204,,
1130,0.97,10007.364,10009.866,Thank you.,205,,
1131,0.97,10009.866,10012.836,"Thank you, colleagues.",206,,

1143,0.97,10094.05,10098.555,I love that last slide.,208,,
1144,0.97,10098.555,10099.622,Thank you for slipping that in.,208,,
1145,0.97,10099.622,10101.057,I had not seen that previously.,208,,

1152,0.97,10121.444,10126.583,I have no questions.,209,,
1153,0.97,10126.583,10128.251,Just a statement of immense gratitude for your work.,209,,
1154,0.97,10128.251,10134.791,And the direction you are taking in light of the Bureau report.,209,,
1155,0.97,10134.791,10137.794,When we met last some of these recommendations had not been made public yet.,209,,
1156,0.97,10137.794,10148.271,And you had not identified to me these methods of moving forward . I am impressed and humbled by your work.,209,,
1157,0.97,10148.271,10149.372,"Thank you, Judge.",209,,
1158,0.97,10149.372,10164.587,Thank you so much Councilmember . are there other comments?,210,,
1159,0.97,10164.587,10179.435,"I will note that for many of us who were on Council before including Councilmember Strauss who was in the second floor with the city council family, this is a very different conversation than we had the last time you went through the budget.",210,,
1160,0.97,10179.435,10203.86,I think that from the conversations I remember at that point we were sort of arguing the merits of day reporting and the parole system and looking at various reports about in many cases the harm done to individuals by requiring them to come in day after day.,210,,
1161,0.97,10203.86,10210.366,This is a very different conversation and I think we are all very appreciative of the positive direction and the budget that reflects those values.,210,,
1162,0.97,10210.366,10211.901,"Councilmember Lewis, please go ahead.",210,,
1163,0.97,10211.901,10212.769,Thank you.,211,,
1164,0.97,10212.769,10225.181,I just have one last question and it's sort of about how these efforts interact with the court resource center.,211,,
1165,0.97,10225.181,10227.383,And some resources in control of the court.,211,,
1166,0.97,10227.383,10269.492,"One thing I have heard in the past for my friends who are public defenders, from comments their clients have made, this is anecdotal, this isn't scientific, I think some was born out in an audit at the resource center, it's that some people feel, don't feel like the court is a welcoming place to receive . So I wonder, I know there are some models in other jurisdictions, where resources like a court resource center are Off-Campus so it could be under the control of the court.",211,,
1167,0.97,10269.492,10278.601,That sort of in a storefront or place where people don't feel the stigma of the environment of the court.,211,,
1168,0.97,10278.601,10280.603,When they are going to take advantage of resources.,211,,
1169,0.97,10280.603,10284.841,That doesn't factor into a potential reluctance to take advantage of them.,211,,
1170,0.97,10284.841,10321.878,"I am curious and looking forward given the model of community court and given the fee increase of an outcome and services based approach, if there is some scope to deliver some of those, to do some that intake or process Off-Campus or if that something has been considered by the court, or with that sort of just be baked in by the service providers themselves, not be based in the court and just doing, by the very act of the diversion your sort of accomplishing a similar goal.",211,,
1171,0.97,10321.878,10339.362,I thought I would throw that out there in terms of how often--I do suspect that often times a lot of folks who are reluctant to engage in day reporting were doing so because there is a stigma associated with the court and potentially being taken into custody.,211,,
1172,0.97,10339.362,10357.013,"I wonder if there's a way, given some new delivery methods, to Abdicate the feelings people have too to make sure we are getting the help out there for folks who really need it.",211,,
1173,0.97,10357.013,10360.817,"You know, --",212,,
1174,0.97,10360.817,10376.099,"On behalf of the court, want to let you know, on behalf of the court, this is one thing, community engagement, we discussed this with some Councilmembers.",213,,
1175,0.97,10376.099,10380.737,Reaching out to community seeing what's best.,213,,
1176,0.97,10380.737,10385.942,One of the things I think would be best is to have something like a community court resource center in the community.,213,,
1177,0.97,10385.942,10390.947,That is something we will be looking at.,213,,
1178,0.97,10390.947,10394.951,I know Carol's going to touch on that little bit more but that is something we have been talking about.,213,,
1179,0.97,10394.951,10395.551,"Go ahead, Carol.",213,,
1180,0.97,10395.551,10398.621,Judge Gregory is right on.,214,,
1181,0.97,10398.621,10406.129,"Just in terms of some of his vision for what the court will look like, in the months and years to come.",214,,
1182,0.97,10406.129,10427.984,"It is quite interesting as we were kind of digging into the area of Covid and how we will survive that and the long-term goal, that he shared with us and we hope to partner in is for one, we started with community outreach event which I'm sure many of you are aware of.",214,,
1183,0.97,10427.984,10436.993,That really started with the vision of getting outside the core building and bringing services to the community.,214,,
1184,0.97,10436.993,10452.975,We started out just going to opportunity for individuals to take care of warrants and then we brought some of our more detailed services into the community where people can start taking care of some of their citations and other things.,214,,
1185,0.97,10452.975,10462.819,And then along with that was the court resource center and had we build out some of those services and bringing them into the community.,214,,
1186,0.97,10462.819,10475.898,We are also expanding on our partnership with Seattle public library and providing some resources we provide through the resource center in Seattle public library starting with the downtown branch.,214,,
1187,0.97,10475.898,10484.106,We have been based in the court resource center and we started over the last year providing some resources in that downtown branch and looking at other ways we can build that out as well.,214,,
1188,0.97,10484.106,10498.12,"One of Judge Gregory's visions is looking at how the magistrates are supporting us and if we can go outside four walls and we want to be able to do something like that, not only with the court resource center with our programs and service division.",214,,
1189,0.97,10498.12,10501.824,How can we meet those individuals where we are?,214,,
1190,0.97,10501.824,10525.281,"Over the next year were going to engage the different Stakeholders and justice system partners to see how they like that realized and come up with a plan to kind of execute that getting us outside the four walls in making it, like you said, a more User-Friendly situation.",214,,
1191,0.97,10525.281,10552.074,"One thing you might be interested to know is a lot of people actually were coming in to the court resource center because they were getting engaged with services and they would come all the way up until the court date because they loved engaging with the people and they weren't afraid to come in because they wanted to get some of the resources we had, just getting them over the Hump of the court date.",214,,
1192,0.97,10552.074,10559.315,We do realize the coming in can be a barrier for individuals.,214,,
1193,0.97,10559.315,10570.326,So we continue to step out there looking at ways to be more innovative.,214,,
1194,0.97,10570.326,10571.394,Thank you so much.,215,,
1195,0.97,10571.394,10576.198,"I just want to clarify, I wasn't trying to imply that under the current model no one was going to the court resource center.",215,,
1196,0.97,10576.198,10588.11,"Just that as you acknowledged, there has been a Subset of folks who have historically had bad connotations with the court and have been reluctant.",215,,
1197,0.97,10588.11,10600.122,"I think being cognizant of that, all those interventions and initiatives sound rewarding and I look forward to working with you guys on that.",215,,
1198,0.97,10600.122,10611.734,It's really great to hear how Proactive the court is being and I really look forward to continuing this partnership.,215,,

1200,0.97,10613.769,10619.875,Are there any additional questions?,217,,
1201,0.97,10619.875,10630.987,I will also note the importance of the previous slides related to the fees and charges as we have talked to many in the community.,218,,
1202,0.97,10630.987,10643.132,It has been clear that the previous model was really funding the court on the backs of those were mostly lack and Brown and people have been harmed by various systems in the past.,218,,
1203,0.97,10643.132,10657.013,I think what you have done is to take some important steps to try to rectify that and I appreciate the conversation the Councilmembers eluded to and looking at different fees and ways to create a more Equable funding structure.,218,,
1204,0.97,10657.013,10675.731,I also appreciate that in order for us to reduce the amount of people constantly Cycling into the court we have to address many of the root causes and that gets back to creating stable housing system and affordable housing opportunity for folks.,218,,
1205,0.97,10675.731,10683.506,It really comes back to the city and our local partners.,218,,
1206,0.97,10683.506,10699.355,I appreciate the last slide you included because I think it's another way to lessen the burden on the court and also hopefully reduce the size of the need that continues to come toward your courtroom.,218,,
1207,0.97,10699.355,10714.47,"I also want to thank folks who worked in the community, organizers, and activists with the budget for justice who set the stage for these reforms to happen.",218,,
1208,0.97,10714.47,10724.28,"It's really exciting to see many of the recommendations, as Councilmember Herbold noted in her opening comments come to Fruitio.",218,,
1209,0.97,10724.28,10741.197,"Also takes leadership from within, judge, you and your team have also acted with urgency, once many of these policy recommendations were being received by people who knew reform was needed, you did act with urgency.",218,,
1210,0.97,10741.197,10747.169,Thank you to you and your team in the many community organizers who have called for this.,218,,
