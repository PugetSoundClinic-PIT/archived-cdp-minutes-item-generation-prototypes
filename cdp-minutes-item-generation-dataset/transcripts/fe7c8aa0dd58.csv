It was drafted with support from local progress and shared with the office of Intergovernmental relations and the law Department is currently waiting for the law office review.",3,,
33,0.97,288.521,301.968,The resolution itself mirrors the resolution supporting the articles of incorporation being discussed in Congress.,3,,
34,0.97,301.968,311.444,And is very similar to the language that has been proposed by representative Elmar.,3,,
35,0.97,311.444,332.799,"I understand there may be another version of a similar resolution circulating but I am sure we can get it together before .

40,0.97,361.027,387.086,"We will also have a Walk- through decision agenda on weapons recommendation of the community police Commission, office of Inspector general and office of police accountability.",3,,
41,0.97,387.086,390.957,It has been a while since the Council unanimously adopted legislation to prohibit the use of less lethal weapons in all circumstances including crowd control and other circumstances.,3,,
42,0.97,390.957,399.465,I want to give some background where we are at and how we got here.,3,,
43,0.97,399.465,416.182,In June after the local protests in response to the murder of George Floyd and heavy use of these weapons by the Seattle police Department the Council adopted ordinance 126102 to prohibit the use of numerous less lethal weapons.,3,,
44,0.97,416.182,431.597,"In July, U.S. District Court Judge Robillard issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibited the ordinance from going into effect . in August, the three accountability bodies completed recommendations as requested by both the Council and the court.",3,,
45,0.97,431.597,440.373,If you recall we included language in the ordinance where we specifically solicited the recommendations of the three accountability bodies.,3,,
46,0.97,440.373,449.816,Gossip back on changes we may need to make to be the ordinance.,3,,
47,0.97,449.816,471.571,"We ask the same of the court, recognizing we were obligated to do so under the consent decree . on September 11 the public safety and human service committee meeting, the accountability bodies including community of police Commission, Inspector general, office of police accountability gave the recommendations to committee members.",3,,
48,0.97,471.571,484.817,On December 17 where there was a Roundtable discussion with these same accountability bodies and we included the Seattle police Department in the discussion as well.,3,,
49,0.97,484.817,512.945,"On December 17 in the public safety and human services committee meeting, we announced that the next meeting that we would have, the one coming out tomorrow, that we would be going through a decision agenda comprised of the recommendations of the accountability bodies and other options to discuss how we might vote and make changes to our existing ordinance.",3,,
50,0.97,512.945,522.688,We are aiming for committee vote on the 26th . But tomorrow's meeting is a continuation in our deliberation.,3,,
51,0.97,522.688,530.296,The legislation would be sent to the monitor as a draft bill.,3,,
52,0.97,530.296,538.905,Together with the Department of justice and judge Robillard for the consent decree process before any final consideration I Council.,3,,
53,0.97,538.905,568.367,"To be clear about where we are now, there is no city law currently in effect with the use of less lethal for crowd control weapons and the limitations that exist right now are a result of the current lawsuit from black lives matter and the ACLU . that is an overview of where we aren't at now.",3,,
54,0.97,568.367,597.663,I think another piece of important background is to consider the judges perspective in the June temporary restraining order he issued that she was critical of the ordinance saying it does not increase public safety and he expressed interest in hearing the recommendations from the three accountability bodies . It is a key reason that committee has met twice to ask questions about the recommendation and why the discussion tomorrow is structured around the recommendation.,3,,
55,0.97,597.663,618.184,"Other items of importance related to the public safety and human service Committee, as mentioned earlier, the Seattle fire Department Covid-19 test testing site is at 550,000 tests.",3,,

58,0.97,654.62,671.904,I want to mention that I as well as others released a statement on Wednesday in response to the National capital violent occupation and to attempt brought on by Donald Trup's refusal to support the peaceful transition of power.,3,,
59,0.97,671.904,674.006,He lost the election.,3,,
60,0.97,674.006,684.45,I also echo Joe Biden's comments on Thursday.,3,,
61,0.97,684.45,691.857,If it had been black lives matter's protesters they would not have been treated very differently than the mob from the capital.,3,,
62,0.97,691.857,693.359,We know this is true.,3,,
63,0.97,693.359,701.967,It is totally unacceptable the American people saw in plain view.,3,,
64,0.97,701.967,718.284,On Friday evening many of us are aware that chief Diaz posted an update in the Seattle police Department Blotter explaining that the department had been made aware that officers were reportedly in DC on Wednesday.,3,,
65,0.97,718.284,725.658,"He went on to say that the Department supports lawful expressions of first amendment, freedom of speech.",3,,
66,0.97,725.658,742.608,But the violent mob was unlawful and resulted in the death of another police officer .Explained the incident has been forwarded to the office of Polce accountability for full review.,3,,
67,0.97,742.608,760.025,I have also been in contact with the office for police accountability and we understand they will investigate whether any of police Department policies were violated and if anything needs to be referred for criminal investigation.,3,,
68,0.97,760.025,778.444,The OPA is investigating the comments of Gilda President Mike Sullivan who falsely claimed both the far right and the far left were responsible for the insurrection and to attempt in Washington DC last week.,3,,
69,0.97,778.444,797.229,And his election campaign he produced a campaign Video that glorified violence and Sensationalized conflict . over the summer he went on national television and call for Federal forces to intervene in Seattle despite the opposition of the chief and Mayor and several Council members.,3,,
70,0.97,797.229,805.671,Now he is Promotin falsehoods about the attack at the capital last week.,3,,
71,0.97,805.671,814.313,I cannot help but wonder whether the actions of these officers were influenced by the rhetoric of their leader.,3,,
72,0.97,814.313,824.256,This is not the person I believe should be leading our police officers Guild in these challenging times of necessary change.,3,,
73,0.97,824.256,827.193,I hope the members come to agree.,3,,
74,0.97,827.193,840.639,"The Mayor released a statement related to this statement, she called it wrong, immoral and a lie.",3,,
75,0.97,840.639,844.877,She said his statements do not reflect the values of the city of Seattle but instead echo the failed laws of the Presidency.,3,,
76,0.97,844.877,857.189,And she mentioned it effect every officer of the police Department has an obligation to not post speech that negatively impacts the Department's ability to serve the public.,3,,
77,0.97,857.189,869.835,This is a quote from the Seattle police Department manual regarding social media . I think that is all I have.,3,,
78,0.97,869.835,871.503,Thank you for giving me extra time today.,3,,
79,0.97,871.503,890.856,"One last thing to mention, is that this week we have a King County regional policy committee meeting and I have office hours, virtual office hours on Friday, January 29 between 2:00 PM and 6:00 PM.",3,,

100,0.97,1051.116,1062.628,"What we learned from sound transit last week, one of the--two of the reasons why is that we have incredible increase in real estate costs and construction.",5,,

106,0.97,1110.375,1128.393,As I said what we are concerned about is the construction market costs and of course property values . The West Seattle Ballard project which is considered one project we are estimating it was around $8 billion and now we are looking at about $12 billion . that is a 50% increase.,5,,
107,0.97,1128.393,1137.369,We are hoping--and also one of the projects in Pierce County has gone up from 11% up to 15%.,5,,
108,0.97,1137.369,1141.907,That is near the Tacoma Dome.,5,,

115,0.97,1169.001,1200.065,"Why this is important, you don't need to see all 44 pages, it actually goes in and explains the cost of the property construction, inflation, and I should note that sound transit has hired a third party Validator to come in to reassess and look at the math and their Calculaions and cost estimates . which is really important.",5,,
116,0.97,1200.065,1206.638,I think we need the outside third party to come in and say your numbers are off or they are good or close.,5,,
