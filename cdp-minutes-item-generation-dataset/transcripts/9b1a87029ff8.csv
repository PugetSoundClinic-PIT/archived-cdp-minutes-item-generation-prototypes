197,0.97,1246.645,1270.602,I was surprised to hear Council allow language to remain in section 8 of the bill that removes the right of legal action from a person who is harmed by police use of these weapons if they quote in the judgment of a reasonable person commits a criminal offense at or immediately prior to the use of less lethal force.,47,,
198,0.97,1270.602,1276.008,That is an overly broad category that opens the door to all sorts of manipulation.,47,,
199,0.97,1276.008,1282.314,It will allow police and the city to wiggle out of justified legal action from doing harm.,47,,
200,0.97,1282.314,1291.723,"Anyone who has been watching SPD can see how this will play out, particularly since we have no effective system of police accountability.",47,,
201,0.97,1291.723,1308.373,You could go to Seattle stop DOT org to find out how Seattle could have a better system of police accountability and join the movement going on in cities across the country.,47,,

225,0.97,1447.412,1454.286,In my 20 years working in this business I've never seen a time as dire as this.,51,,
226,0.97,1454.286,1459.591,We have obviously been hit tremendously hard within the retail sector.,51,,
227,0.97,1459.591,1465.664,The retail tenants are typically the tenants that would occupy ground floor spaces within office buildings.,51,,
228,0.97,1465.664,1481.746,The office use within the retail space would not Cannibalize in my opinion the retail premise rather it would drive the density we need back to the streets in terms of population as well as help with crime and from the nighttime activity.,51,,
229,0.97,1481.746,1501.833,Once again I am in absolute favor of the amendment and the bill 120121 having countless times brought it up against zoning challenges where either its users or owners of real estate looking to put together favorable transactions and we have not been able to do so.,51,,

240,0.97,1550.615,1617.849,When we started with the impacts that the you have seen throughout downtown and the vacant store fronts we appreciate the work that the Mayor has done in trying to bring stake holders together to look at short term tools for interim recovery and I agree with the conversation that Happenedthis morning at the work session and I want to call out the--the language that Council member Lewis has proposed Particuarly the language that allowed for light manufacturing and makers space so the flexibility to have some additional active interesting uses at the ground level and also want to talk in support of the conversation that I understand Council member Strauss and Council member Lewis has had to tailor solutions that recognizes the unique character of that district and also I think this is an important innovation--of giving don director staff the ability to administratively approve some of the uses which means that that retail space will be able to be permitted faster.,53,,
241,0.97,1617.849,1651.149,"That is why while I know this conversation about land use can be complicated and we appreciate the patience that the Council President, I would join in that conversation to say we support the Aemds and was able to talk this morning with the Alliance for Pioneer staff particularly about the new Lewis amendment I think he will be bringing forward and would echo the support both on behalf of the alliance which has authorized me to say that and on some of those Pioneer stake holders for this new Lewis amendment which reflects the compromised language in Pioneer square.",53,,

522,0.97,2744.675,2752.95,The public safety and human services committee voted 4-1 to pass it at our meeting on July 13th.,210,,
523,0.97,2752.95,2763.927,At that time I moved to hold it so we would not hear Nit full council until after the consent decree status con Flaens occurred last week.,210,,

525,0.97,2776.406,2788.919,The court had no comment on the legislation in the status conference and so I am looking forward to our discussion and vote on it today.,210,,

528,0.97,2810.374,2833.897,The bill conditions the use of pepper spray and pepper ball launchers on instances when the risk of serious bodily injury from violent actions outweighs the risk of harm to bystanders and separately from the conditions on pepper spray and pepper ball launchers.,210,,
529,0.97,2833.897,2840.204,Tear gas is allowed and even more narrow circumstances.,210,,
530,0.97,2840.204,2847.711,The legislation does not regulate the use of Nonchemical launchers.,210,,
531,0.97,2847.711,2879.376,"For instance bean bag, rubber bullets, blue tip launchers and so the--there is no regulation in the code as it relates to the use of those particular type of less lethal weapons and that is important--for folks who have raised questions about what less lethal weapons are available in instances where there is a threat of property damage.",210,,
532,0.97,2879.376,2890.42,When we were in deliberations around this legislation myself and Council President Gonzalez met with the consent decree monitor and the Department of justice.,210,,

535,0.97,2907.971,2917.948,The committee first acted back in February after several months of discussion to recommend a draft bill that was used for those discussions.,210,,
536,0.97,2917.948,2945.475,During the conversations about the draft bill we heard from the kept of justice concern that restricting the use of certain less lethal--circumstances could lead to officers using higher levels of force putting both assault of protesters and the surrounding non-violent protesters both at higher risk of harm.,210,,
537,0.97,2945.475,2946.743,The judge expressed similar concerns.,210,,
538,0.97,2946.743,2958.755,The DOJ like wise inquired as to whether the draft bill allowed for relevant SPD officers to be trained in changes to policy.,210,,
539,0.97,2958.755,2967.297,Again to avoid the unwanted impact of having untrained officers resort higher level of force than necessary.,210,,
540,0.97,2967.297,2971.735,This was an issue that the judge also raced.,210,,
541,0.97,2971.735,3039.403,"So by submitting the draft legislation for this inform review receiving this kind of feedback, it allowed us to make further amendments to pass legislation before the legislation itself was referred and in order to help address those concerns the Council D--[Indiscernible] another update after hearing back from the monitor and Department of Justice was to make clear that in narrow circumstances as it relates to pepper ball launchers that they can't be used for the purpose of crowd control but if there is a large group of people and the purpose isn't crowd control but it is the risk of avoiding serious bodily injury from violent actions and that out weigh Tgs risk of harm to bystanders.",210,,
542,0.97,3039.403,3092.689,"The purpose isn't to move people but is intended to--to--mitigate or limit the likelihood that somebody is seriously hurt in a crowd that the pepper ball launchers are--[Indiscernible] again this not only is in response feedback received through this inform review process but it also recognizes that a District Court ruling just very, very recently specified that--approve policies for the use of our pepper ball launchers and the judge authorized the use of pepper ball launchers in late February as part of SPD's court mandated annual update to use of force policies.",210,,
543,0.97,3092.689,3110.54,So give than just in February the judge approved the use of pepper ball launchers in this narrow circumstance we can't very well ask him to review a new poll say that Revokes the allowance he has approved.,210,,
544,0.97,3110.54,3125.889,Just a reminder that this all started back in June of 2020 with the Council's unanimous adoption of legislation sponsored by Council member Sawant.,210,,
545,0.97,3126.022,3138.502,[Indiscernible] the response from the court was to almost immediately issue a restraining order on that bill in July of last year.,210,,
546,0.97,3138.502,3149.212,In its ruling the court stated in the temporary restraining order that the legislation did not have public safety.,210,,
547,0.97,3149.212,3158.755,"In August 2020 the CPC, the Oig and the OPA commented on the legislation that the council passed.",210,,
548,0.97,3158.755,3165.495,They sent us recommendations for how we might consider changing it.,210,,
549,0.97,3165.495,3176.206,We shared that feedback from our accountability partners in our committee that feedback was also sent to the judge as well because he also had requested that feedback.,210,,
550,0.97,3176.206,3184.381,This bill has consumed much of the time and efforts of the public safety and human services committee over the last year.,210,,
551,0.97,3184.381,3195.458,We have discussed this policy including Roundtables with our account ability partners in seven separate public safety and human services committee meetings since last September.,210,,
552,0.97,3195.458,3211.041,"While not perfect, my overall goal is to adopt the strongest legislation possible, building ton consensus recommendations of the three accountability bodies within the context of the consent decree.",210,,
553,0.97,3211.041,3222.085,Just want to note the CPC did write to the committee in support for the legislation while noting the perspective they believe more needs be done.,210,,
554,0.97,3222.085,3229.726,They wrote to say the Seattle community police Commission writes today to offer its support of Council bill 120105.,210,,
555,0.97,3229.726,3251.214,The Commission believes that the bill's inclusion of clear of when less lethal weapons can and cannot be used and limitations on who can use them is a significant first step in ensuring the safety of community members when they engage in first amendment protected protests.,210,,
556,0.97,3251.214,3253.917,I have heard concerns in past committee meetings.,210,,
557,0.97,3253.917,3267.631,We heard some of this today about the right of action contained in the ordinance and this is the right of action for members of the public to pursue what they perceive as violations of the ordinance.,210,,
558,0.97,3267.631,3278.375,I want to be clear the language in the ordinance allows the city to offer an affirmative defense that the violation did not occur.,210,,
559,0.97,3278.375,3288.451,The language will not make anyone that accused of a crime ineligible from using the right of action merely because they have been accused of a crime.,210,,
560,0.97,3288.451,3292.756,A person accused after crime can file suit under the right of action.,210,,
561,0.97,3292.756,3308.638,It is not accurate as some have suggested that if the affirmative defense was used that the judgment of a reasonable person a crime was committed that the city and N order to prevail would only have to prove an officer said they thought a crime was committed.,210,,
562,0.97,3308.638,3316.313,That is not the legal standard of the a--affirmative defense.,210,,
563,0.97,3316.313,3332.095,"Just closing out, if the legislation passes today, the Seattle police Department will draft policy revisions that reflect ordinance.",210,,
564,0.97,3332.095,3336.833,They are do so within 60 days provided by section 4 of the bill.,210,,
565,0.97,3336.833,3344.507,The DOJ and the monitor would then review the policy revisions and this is when their formal review under the consent decree takes place.,210,,
566,0.97,3344.507,3348.278,Then the court would review the policy revisions.,210,,
567,0.97,3348.278,3360.156,"And the finally if the court APPROVES the policy revisions, then t revised policies and provisions of the bill will take effect.",210,,
568,0.97,3360.156,3375.772,"So, um U really want to thank my colleagues on the public safety and human services committee for sticking with this for many, many months and meetings and hours.",210,,
569,0.97,3375.772,3387.917,Appreciate all of the engagement with our accountability partners throughout process as well as the feed bark--feedback we have received.,210,,
570,0.97,3387.917,3400.196,I hope we can all count on your vote in favor of this legislation today.,210,,
571,0.97,3400.196,3400.497,Thank you.,210,,
572,0.97,3400.497,3401.765,Thank you so much.,211,,
573,0.97,3401.765,3406.402,Are there any additional comments on the bill?,211,,
574,0.97,3406.402,3408.605,"Council member Strauss, please.",211,,
575,0.97,3408.605,3409.239,Thank you Council President.,212,,
576,0.97,3409.239,3424.053,Council member Herbold I have a couple of questions mostly repeating back to you what I heard you just say to make sure I got this clearly since I don't sit on your Committee.,212,,
577,0.97,3424.053,3429.626,Just hearing the court had no comment on these bills during last week's meeting.,212,,
578,0.97,3429.626,3442.672,Is that to be interpreted as they have no issues or they--may have issues but made no comment?,212,,
579,0.97,3442.672,3443.206,The latter.,213,,
580,0.97,3443.206,3447.877,We held the bill from being heard in full council.,213,,
581,0.97,3447.877,3454.918,We delayed it because we thought it might be a topic.,213,,
582,0.97,3454.918,3462.292,The settlement conference was scheduled without any information about what the topic was going to be.,213,,
583,0.97,3462.292,3468.598,"They--or we had some information, we didn't know if it was going to include this.",213,,
584,0.97,3468.598,3470.633,So the settlement conference occurred.,213,,
585,0.97,3470.633,3473.403,Was a quarterly settlement conference that the city regular Harley has.,213,,
586,0.97,3473.403,3476.706,This did not come up a as topic.,213,,
587,0.97,3476.706,3476.94,Okay.,214,,
588,0.97,3476.94,3483.513,I heard clearly the CP Skrshgs--CPC is in favor of this.,214,,
589,0.97,3483.513,3487.116,Did the monitor have concerns that have not been addressed?,214,,
590,0.97,3487.116,3500.83,So we will find out whether or not there have been concerns that have not been addressed when we go through the process.,215,,
591,0.97,3500.83,3501.197,Thanking you.,216,,
592,0.97,3501.197,3506.936,The last question is what I think I heard you say just to put it very clearly.,216,,
593,0.97,3506.936,3520.917,That after this is passed and before it goes into implementation the DOJ and the monitor will have time to review and decide what is implemented and what is not implemented.,216,,
594,0.97,3520.917,3526.856,My question is just ensuring we are not at odds with the profession SES and we are in tandem with it.,216,,
595,0.97,3526.856,3529.259,Is that a correct understanding?,216,,
596,0.97,3529.259,3532.528,That is correct.,217,,
597,0.97,3532.528,3532.829,Thank you.,217,,
598,0.97,3532.829,3533.229,Thank you.,218,,
599,0.97,3533.229,3534.13,Job well done.,218,,
600,0.97,3534.13,3538.868,Thank you Council member Strauss for those questions.,219,,
601,0.97,3538.868,3568.565,And I do want to sort of emphasize--I've been participating with Council member Herbold in the background on many of these process related issues and just want to emphasize my belief we have really done everything we can as a city Council to protect the integrity of our legislative authority while also complying with what we think are legal obligations under the consent decree.,219,,
602,0.97,3568.565,3580.043,Don't think that I--I really do believe moving forward on this legislation now is the next step in that process to allow us to enter the bill into the more formal review process.,219,,
603,0.97,3580.043,3591.421,I think we have done everything we can in the informal process to try to identify those issues.,219,,
604,0.97,3591.421,3599.963,I think this is the next step to allowing for perhaps a more official fuller review of the bill.,219,,
605,0.97,3599.963,3615.411,That doesn't mean the they won't identify additional concerns but I think at that point those concerns would be related to the policies as opposed to whether or not the Council complied with the process.,219,,
606,0.97,3615.411,3617.647,Thank you Madam President.,220,,
607,0.97,3617.647,3631.894,I wanted to say thank you to Council member Herbold as chair of public safety and for Stewarting this conversation through.,220,,
608,0.97,3631.894,3657.52,I think all of us are really showing this legislation in this amended form is an important component to making sure we are moving our commitment to accountability forward and doing so in partnership with our accountability partners along the way.,220,,
609,0.97,3657.52,3667.296,I think importance of this legislation cannot be under stated as the memories of last year's response to the protest are still relatively fresh and N many of our minds.,220,,
610,0.97,3667.296,3668.331,We all remember the stories.,220,,
611,0.97,3668.331,3684.714,"We all remember the public testimony, the hours of calls we received as people expressed their frustration and many times their surprise and shock about the response to the protests that were standing up in support of black lives.",220,,
612,0.97,3684.714,3702.899,"We also heard a number of reports and this was covered in the press as well as people calling our offices to note that members of the National press, legal observers, medics are been pepper sprayed or hit by projectiles like blast balls and launchers.",220,,
613,0.97,3702.899,3706.002,We saw Video of a child being sprayed in the face.,220,,
614,0.97,3706.002,3717.246,We heard the testimony of the father of a 9 month old baby calling for an end to a days of use of tear gas in our most dense neighborhood in Seattle and Capitol Hill.,220,,
615,0.97,3717.246,3721.617,The father of 59 month old who had Woken up to their baby foaming at the mouth.,220,,
616,0.97,3721.617,3742.205,"I think it is fair to say we believe that nobody deserves to be afraid of physical harm when doing their job whether they are members of our officers, police officers or members of the press, medics, legal observers, everybody doing their job and also standing up to express their first amendment right has a right to be safe.",220,,
617,0.97,3742.205,3758.454,We also want to make sure bystanders like the many people who called in are also free from harm and want to make sure that th tools used by our public officers are first Prioritizing public safety.,220,,
618,0.97,3758.454,3765.161,I think the legislation puts an in place important side rails for how our police Department interact with crowds and demonstrations.,220,,
619,0.97,3765.161,3775.404,I'm also hopeful these policies can help Deescalate the response to make sure it is not continuing to escalate when we see tools that are causing harm to folks.,220,,
620,0.97,3775.404,3779.308,I look forward to voting yes on this legislation.,220,,
621,0.97,3779.308,3786.916,Appreciate the hard work that has gone into this and the importance of this ledge it Tliegs day--legislation today.,220,,
622,0.97,3786.916,3789.018,Thank you for your work on it.,220,,
623,0.97,3789.018,3790.887,Thank you so much.,221,,
624,0.97,3790.887,3795.358,Are there any additional comments on the bill.,221,,
625,0.97,3795.358,3806.235,So before I hand it back over to make final remarks I also wanted to echo my gratitude to Council member Herbold as the chair of public safety committee.,221,,
626,0.97,3806.235,3808.104,This has been a long process.,221,,
627,0.97,3808.104,3868.631,I think it has been--it almost a Yearlong process if not just Slighly a little longer than that and so I think I have a high level of confidence in the process that has been Stewarted by Council member Herbold and think it is time for us to--[Indiscernible] I think this is a good threading of the Needl and appreciate the good work of Council member Herbold.,221,,
628,0.97,3868.631,3871.701,She managed to thank everyone else at the city.,221,,
629,0.97,3871.701,3885.147,It is our rest to believe the thank her for the good work she has done on a very important issue with a lot of really tricky challenges and a lot of stake holder engagement that needed to happen.,221,,
630,0.97,3885.147,3885.715,My thanks to you.,221,,
631,0.97,3885.715,3894.223,I will hand it back over the you for closing out debates so we can call this bill to a vote.,221,,
632,0.97,3894.223,3895.825,Thank you very much.,222,,
633,0.97,3895.825,3930.96,I did thank a lot of the external stake holders but I would like also to close out with my appreciation for the many folks internal to the city who have been helping on this bill including Alyssa on Council central staff and my office--[Indiscernible] as well as our own--legal Council that has been assisting us on this legislation as well.,222,,
634,0.97,3930.96,3964.894,I know people have spent a lot of hours and really it is because I think we believe in the intent of the bill which is to create some reasonable restrictions where none currently exist so that we can do everything we can to ensure the safety of community members engaging in first amendment protected protests.,222,,
635,0.97,3964.894,3987.583,It is really important that we continue continue our work in this area protecting civil liberties during protests but also recognizing that we are doing so within the context of the consent decree as Council President Gonzalez put it.,222,,
636,0.97,3987.583,4032.161,It is a bit of a threading after needle but I look forward to the next step in this process where we go into the formal policy review and having this legislation still--again perhaps not as--as broad as the legislation we is all voted in favor on in June last year but still think it is historic effort for the city of Seattle to take this position regulating these weapons in the goal of Preing civil liberties and the rights of folks to protest.,222,,
637,0.97,4032.161,4032.461,Thank you.,222,,
638,0.97,4032.461,4033.896,All right.,223,,

660,0.97,4077.64,4092.021,Council bill 120148 relating to parking enforcement amending ordinance 126237 which adopted the 2021 budget transferring positions out of the Seattle police Department and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.,241,,
661,0.97,4092.021,4095.491,The committee recommends the bill passes amended.,241,,
662,0.97,4095.491,4096.392,Thank you so much.,242,,
663,0.97,4096.392,4097.66,This one also comes from your Committee.,242,,
664,0.97,4097.66,4099.829,I will hand it back over to you.,242,,
665,0.97,4099.829,4101.43,Thank you so much.,243,,
666,0.97,4101.43,4121.117,"So just as a bit of background last year during the budget process that, the Council express our intent of transferring both the parking enforcement officers and 911 dispatch out of the Seattle police Department and into the new community safety and communication center.",243,,
667,0.97,4121.117,4134.196,In May the we took the ledge Elselation up that would implement the planned action from the budget process the previous fall.,243,,
668,0.97,4134.196,4138.901,At that time there was a divided work force.,243,,
669,0.97,4138.901,4151.914,The supervisors of the parking enforcement officers were interested in moving to Sdot.,243,,
670,0.97,4151.914,4164.793,The parking enforcement Alwayser--officer wanted to go to the community safety and communications center.,243,,
671,0.97,4164.793,4183.913,"Because there is this division among workers and also among management, the executive was very interested in going to Sdot as were several Council members.",243,,
672,0.97,4183.913,4192.121,We amended that legislation.,243,,
673,0.97,4192.121,4206.035,We included the extension to allow us to continue to have the conversation and make sure the Peos were continuing to get paid while still at the Seattle police Department.,243,,
674,0.97,4206.035,4210.105,That extension expires on September 1ST.,243,,
675,0.97,4210.105,4216.579,This extra time did not really have an outcome of a different result.,243,,
676,0.97,4216.579,4218.914,There is still a divided work force.,243,,
677,0.97,4218.914,4257.987,I know that the front line parking enforcement officers and pro Tech who represents the PEO officers are still in conversations with how to come to an agreement and improve relations but I have heard that--that the position haven't changed but never the less I am--being responsive to the fact that a majority of Council members are interested in transferring Peos to the Seattle Department of transportation.,243,,
678,0.97,4257.987,4263.792,For that reason the bill does transfer the PEO unit to Sdot.,243,,
679,0.97,4263.792,4270.799,The bill includes a ratify and confirm clause to ensure the unit is paid come September.,243,,

710,0.97,4392.721,4412.641,[Indiscernible] the land use code encourages pedestrian friendly Street uses.,263,,
711,0.97,4412.641,4432.194,This is true--this is also true of neighborhood commercial district street level uses although the standards for downtown are even more narrow than throughout our city.,263,,
712,0.97,4432.194,4446.608,In response downtown store front vacancies the Mayor proposes Council bill 120121 to expand the uses allowed on the street leave until downtown so that these vacancies have able to be filled more quickly.,263,,
713,0.97,4446.608,4457.119,The list roughly mirrors the list of allowed street level uses in Non-Downtown neighborhood commercial districts.,263,,
714,0.97,4457.119,4463.892,More conservative downtown these lists mirror the neighborhood commercial districts uses that are on the street level.,263,,
715,0.97,4463.892,4474.937,"So new allowed street level uses downtown would include art installations, community centers, medical offices, Co-Working spaces and gyms or other amenities associated with apartment building or a hotel.",263,,
716,0.97,4474.937,4484.246,The ordinance would be effect to one year after which new uses from the expanded list would not be allowed without further action.,263,,
717,0.97,4484.246,4496.124,Uses are permitted within the one year window would be granted the ability to remain until that use ends.,263,,
718,0.97,4496.124,4511.974,If a use is in a space that use ends that exempted use could not be replied if it is outside the one year parameter.,263,,
719,0.97,4511.974,4527.89,The land use and neighborhood Committee--[Indiscernible] before I turn it back over the Council President would like thank everyone who worked on this legislation.,263,,

732,0.97,4600.862,4608.17,When we get to the substitute version of amendment 3 we can do this discussion of the rules.,266,,
733,0.97,4608.17,4615.277,These initial amendments don't require a discussion of the rules so lets take them.,266,,

741,0.97,4637.132,4646.842,As we discussed this morning amendment 1 is the light manufacturing component of what historically was one combined amendment.,270,,
742,0.97,4646.842,4662.724,My office did based on feedback from the committee hearing separate out the light manufacturing which had a consensus from committee members and from city departments to be part of the ultimate bill.,270,,
743,0.97,4662.724,4677.639,The more controversial discussion around street level office use was something that--I thought the Council would benefit being able to have a separate vote on given there was consensus on the other Happ half.,270,,
744,0.97,4677.639,4716.211,"This amendment only addresses the light manufacturing of which there is harmony within the city and stake holders in support of--as part of the considerations this morning of moving this along--the downtown Seattle Association, myself and Council member Strauss agreed to no longer pursue the amendment for street level office use in the downtown neighborhood opting instead to--leave that issue alone based on feedback for the Department and a lack of interest and further pursuing it given some of that feedback.",270,,
745,0.97,4716.211,4724.519,I will not be moving amendment 2 only amendment 1 and a revised version of amendment 3 based on that feedback.,270,,
746,0.97,4724.519,4737.499,I don't have anything else to add to that unless colleagues have questions that I can answer but otherwise I will just---- be ready to vote when the Council is satisfied.,270,,

773,0.97,4819.948,4821.283,Is that correct?,289,,
774,0.97,4821.283,4831.793,We are moving to amendment 3 which Council member Lewis has indicated requires a suspension of the rules since there is a substitute.,290,,
775,0.97,4831.793,4840.302,If there is no objection the Council rule relating to circulation of amendments by 12 plan to be suspended to allow consideration of a new version of amendment 3.,290,,

794,0.97,4947.175,4954.049,So this--this is a control that was important to the Pioneer square business area.,298,,
795,0.97,4954.049,4959.721,There is one notable carve out in the legislation.,298,,
796,0.97,4959.721,4968.263,That is for the area's zoned Psm85120 zone.,298,,
797,0.97,4968.263,5000.128,This change is supported as was heard in public comment to address a unique condition in that area in the neighborhood that is isolated where the street level use recruitment has been particularly difficult and there is already a perspective tenant that this particular constituent has so it is--was a priority for the alliance to make that exception.,298,,
798,0.97,5000.128,5016.111,We heard a number of folks call in urging passage of this amendment.,298,,

830,0.97,5120.448,5141.102,There are a lot of very interested stake holders in the downtown Pioneer square and South Lake Union neighborhoods who are eager to use these new rules to inject new vibrancy and vitality into these neighborhoods that have experienced the brunt of the impact from Covid.,317,,
831,0.97,5141.102,5156.684,It is really critical to note that this could be the beginning of a big Reinvention and increased--in these neighborhoods which have had very restrictive uses for these store fronts.,317,,
