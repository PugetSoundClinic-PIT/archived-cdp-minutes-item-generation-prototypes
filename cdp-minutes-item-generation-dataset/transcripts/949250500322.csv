44,0.97,210.443,213.046,Thank you so much.,18,,
45,0.97,213.046,214.347,Retro?,19,,
46,0.97,214.347,215.148,Rachel Cicero.,20,,
47,0.97,215.148,219.218,I'm in the innovation team.,20,,
48,0.97,219.218,223.656,I helped to leave the driver outreach.,20,,
49,0.97,223.656,225.124,Thank you so much.,20,,
50,0.97,225.124,231.564,"All right, deputy Mayor, the floor is yours.",20,,
51,0.97,231.564,233.032,Please walk us through this presentation.,20,,
52,0.97,233.032,233.7,Thank you Councilmembers.,21,,
53,0.97,233.7,235.501,I am very pleased to be at the table.,21,,
54,0.97,235.501,243.576,The virtual table to begin the conversation about part two of Mayor Durkan's fair share plan.,21,,
55,0.97,243.576,249.716,"As Y'all may recall last year, Mayor Durkan, in partnership with the counselor, developed the fair share plan, which had two specific components.",21,,
56,0.97,249.716,257.79,Component one was a Pro-Ride tests that was implemented by a unanimous vote by Council last year.,21,,
57,0.97,257.79,260.059,On East transportation network company.,21,,
58,0.97,260.059,269.402,"Then, the second component was the proposal we are going to be discussing today.",21,,
59,0.97,269.402,274.274,Which is to develop a minimum compensation standard for drivers who drive for transportation network companies.,21,,
60,0.97,274.274,278.878,Next slide please.,21,,
61,0.97,278.878,300.433,"So, basically, we spent a little over a year working with, and you will hear from the study authors, developing a study to develop a proposal and legislation that will be transmitted to Council in the next few weeks on developing a minimum compensation standard.",21,,
62,0.97,300.433,313.046,"Rachel will walk you through the outreach and engagement we did with thousands of transportation network company drivers who shared with us their experiences, diving for these companies.",21,,
63,0.97,313.046,330.53,"As well as kind of, we also were able to collect a large amount of data on wages that sort of tell a story of what it is to work for the transportation network companies, and what that means in terms of the wage standards.",21,,
64,0.97,330.53,333.566,"Just in terms of a quick Contextual please, the nature of work is changing.",21,,
65,0.97,333.566,356.689,"Regular shift jobs are giving way to get work, we are seeing it in terms of not just Uber and Lyft, but also with the pandemic, we have seen delivery for food and for groceries and other types of tasks that are being performed by workers who are classified as independent contractors.",21,,
66,0.97,356.689,373.172,"These drivers, even though their work is controlled in many ways by the company, don't have, they are not subject to minimum wage standards that we have for large employers in the city of Seattle.",21,,
67,0.97,373.172,375.808,Which is currently at minimum wage requirement of $16.35.,21,,
68,0.97,375.808,393.092,"What we have seen through both Real-World analysis of data, that we were shared, that after maintenance, insurance, and gas, many were not earning minimum wage.",21,,
69,0.97,393.092,396.329,They don't receive standard worker protections like workers compensation or health insurance.,21,,
70,0.97,396.329,411.144,"As a result, what we are seeing is that these drivers have no understanding of what they will make when they drive for these companies.",21,,
71,0.97,411.144,425.558,"I'll talk a little bit more about the impacts of Covid, but what we are also seeing is the uncertainty around their ability to earn a reliable wage has been exacerbated by Covid.",21,,
72,0.97,425.558,429.462,We will go through this proposal in detail in the subsequent slides.,21,,
73,0.97,429.462,436.969,"The legislation that will be sent down in a couple weeks from now, will mandate a minimum compensation floor.",21,,
74,0.97,436.969,445.044,"Basically what this means is that no driver will be paid less than $16.39 per hour, plus reasonable expenses.",21,,
75,0.97,445.044,456.856,"As a reminder, in order to work for these companies, these drivers are required to have obviously a car that they are able to use to pick up and drop off passengers.",21,,
76,0.97,456.856,464.096,These car lease really have excesses associated with them.,21,,
77,0.97,464.096,470.503,"Currently, those expenses are not reimbursed to and Lyft.",21,,
78,0.97,470.503,479.612,"Essentially drivers have to dig into their own earnings, in order to bear these expenses.",21,,
79,0.97,479.612,483.883,The second component is the drivers will be paid for all their time on the App.,21,,
80,0.97,483.883,495.027,"What that means is that basically when drivers are around circling, so when you pull up your App and you see these little cars on your App moving around.",21,,
81,0.97,495.027,497.697,Those are drivers waiting to accept a ride.,21,,
82,0.97,497.697,500.967,Currently those drivers are not paid for that time that they spend circling.,21,,
83,0.97,500.967,514.747,"Finally, the expenses component, which will be embedded into the ordinance, will include expenses that are incurred while they operate their car.",21,,
84,0.97,514.747,525.324,"As a reminder, they can't work without being able to drive, and so obviously those expenses that are currently not reimbursed and per this legislation will be required to be reimbursed.",21,,
85,0.97,525.324,526.826,Next slide please.,21,,
86,0.97,526.826,533.633,"Councilmember Strauss, I see you do have your hand up.",22,,
87,0.97,533.633,535.902,If you can hold questions until the end of the presentation.,22,,
88,0.97,535.902,536.869,That would be great.,22,,
89,0.97,536.869,538.871,Go ahead deputy Mayor.,22,,
90,0.97,538.871,551.584,"So, just think about, even Pre-Covid, we had heard from drivers around uncertainty, around the wage they made.",23,,
91,0.97,551.584,573.739,"Also, challenges around their certainty to be able to drive for these companies . As Council knows, you established a driver resolution center as part of the legislation last year that will help addressed issues of unfair reactivation.",23,,
92,0.97,573.739,581.781,"What we have seen in Covid, as demand has significantly dropped, for example in New York, writes have dropped by as much as 84%.",23,,
93,0.97,581.781,591.524,"So, what that means is that these drivers who are ready have uncertainty in their ability to make a living wage, have seen that further eroded during Covid.",23,,
94,0.97,591.524,596.829,We have seen similar declines in the city of Seattle.,23,,
95,0.97,596.829,599.632,"Again, these drivers are the front-line workers.",23,,
96,0.97,599.632,602.301,They are operating a risk to themselves.,23,,
97,0.97,602.301,612.845,They are currently helping to transport essential workers in many cases to their jobs.,23,,
98,0.97,612.845,617.35,They are in situations where they have to be out on the road in their cars in order to do their jobs.,23,,
99,0.97,617.35,632.398,"Currently they don't have access to any protections that other workers have been afforded during Covid-19, including the ability to afford health insurance, and especially being able to take time off so they can care for themselves or a loved one.",23,,
100,0.97,632.398,636.035,"Currently, that would be unpaid time off.",23,,
101,0.97,636.035,639.171,Moving to the next slide.,23,,
102,0.97,639.171,651.484,"So, it's really important, given kind of the circumstances we have seen with Covid, but as well as just the longer term policy to be able to set a wage floor.",23,,
103,0.97,651.484,653.085,So they make a living wage.,23,,
104,0.97,653.085,676.208,"We want to create a policy that was informed by research, and a policy that has the ability to adapt over time, and also create some consensus to have their drivers spend less time circling and more time with a passenger in the car.",23,,
105,0.97,676.208,677.877,Let's talk a little bit about Drivetime.,23,,
106,0.97,677.877,679.678,Right now we have three phases of Drivetime.,23,,
107,0.97,679.678,683.115,"Phase one, phase two, and phase three.",23,,
108,0.97,683.115,688.421,Phase one is essentially the circling time.,23,,
109,0.97,688.421,691.257,This is when you open up your App to look for an Uber or Lyft.,23,,
110,0.97,691.257,693.526,You will see drivers circling.,23,,
111,0.97,693.526,695.327,That time is called P one time.,23,,
112,0.97,695.327,697.53,They are logged into the platform.,23,,
113,0.97,697.53,699.799,They are awaiting a passenger.,23,,
114,0.97,699.799,704.236,Currently drivers are not paid for any of that time.,23,,
115,0.97,704.236,709.141,"The second time, or second phase is P2.",23,,
116,0.97,709.141,711.544,This is the dispatch time.,23,,
117,0.97,711.544,722.755,"Basically once you request a time, and a driver ACCEPTS that trip, and they are on their way to come pick you up, that time is known as P2 time.",23,,
118,0.97,722.755,729.462,"In very few cases, and rare exceptions, drivers are not compensated for this time.",23,,
119,0.97,729.462,740.039,"Despite the fact that they are driving to pick up a passenger, that time is not paid for by the companies.",23,,
120,0.97,740.039,747.947,"The only rare exception is if a company CANCELS a trip, there are some instances where the driver is compensated for that time.",23,,
121,0.97,747.947,750.382,The final time is the P3 time.,23,,
122,0.97,750.382,757.723,"This is when a passenger is in the car, they are picked up from their location, and dropped off at their destination.",23,,
123,0.97,757.723,759.892,This is the P3 time.,23,,
124,0.97,759.892,770.269,This is the time that the current compensation structure that is employed by Uber and Lyft compensate drivers for this time.,23,,
125,0.97,770.269,780.613,"Now, I'm going to handed over to Kerem Levitas with the office of labor standards, who is going to talk about how this policy was developed.",23,,
126,0.97,780.613,789.388,Including the research and the study that was developed to help inform the policy that we will be giving you in the next few weeks.,23,,
127,0.97,789.388,791.991,Thank you deputy Mayor.,23,,
128,0.97,791.991,800.733,Just one additional point I wanted to add.,24,,
129,0.97,800.733,816.415,"In addition to understanding the phases of time, it's important to keep in mind that a driver cannot be in P3 transporting a passenger, sort of the side of the business that is most visible, they cannot do that work without first being in P1 and P2.",24,,
130,0.97,816.415,822.655,It is a necessary component simply to do the job and provide the service that many folks in Seattle and around the country enjoy.,24,,
131,0.97,822.655,831.664,That's really way we wanted to center providing compensation for all three phases of work in the policy development.,24,,
132,0.97,831.664,838.137,"Similarly, the companies Temselves, both compete and provide their service to customers.",24,,
133,0.97,838.137,844.376,"By ensuring that drivers are available, and are able to respond to rides.",24,,
134,0.97,844.376,852.151,That is sort of a central component of their business and how they provide service to customers.,24,,
135,0.97,852.151,854.82,We also felt it was important to ensure that time was compensated fully.,24,,
136,0.97,854.82,862.294,"With that said, let me see if I can switch slides and talk at the same time.",24,,
137,0.97,862.294,868.2,I just want to provide a little background on the work we did.,24,,
138,0.97,868.2,876.108,"As Councilmembers will remember, council passed an ordinance last year that set up this study that you will hear about today.",24,,
139,0.97,876.108,883.415,It required that the city conduct an independent study.,24,,
140,0.97,883.415,891.724,"To propose a fair pay standard, that includes compensation for expenses, and pays drivers for all their time.",24,,
141,0.97,891.724,900.699,"The way that we went about that work, was we retained two outside experts.",24,,
142,0.97,900.699,903.335,"Professor Michael Reich, and another professor.",24,,
143,0.97,903.335,908.207,Professor Reich is at Uc Berkeley.,24,,
144,0.97,908.207,911.243,They will say more about how they conducted their work in just a little bit.,24,,
145,0.97,911.243,913.913,We also took another step.,24,,
146,0.97,913.913,924.657,"We knew that in addition to the academic and scientific aspect, to looking at this work, it was important to reach out to drivers and talk to them directly.",24,,
147,0.97,924.657,930.362,So that their direct experience and perspective was included on the policy development.,24,,
148,0.97,930.362,935.434,And so Rachel Cicero will say more on that.,24,,
149,0.97,935.434,941.573,"Two of the just baseline levels of things I want to lay out, is the pay standard you will hear proposed today is a floor.",24,,
150,0.97,941.573,945.744,It is a minimum guarantee so that drivers don't fall below a certain level.,24,,
151,0.97,945.744,948.647,Drivers can always earn more.,24,,
152,0.97,948.647,950.883,That is always a possibility.,24,,
153,0.97,950.883,964.496,"The second thing is that the pay standard I believe, and our office believes, sort of threads the need of the maintaining driver flexibility.",24,,
154,0.97,964.496,975.207,It does not mandate employment status for drivers of you have seen in some jurisdictions.,24,,
155,0.97,975.207,979.111,The TNC's can continue to classify their drivers as they wish.,24,,
156,0.97,979.111,985.584,"There is no restriction on the number of drivers that can become a TNC driver, or on their work hours.",24,,
157,0.97,985.584,988.42,I just wanted to sort of level set those four principles.,24,,
158,0.97,988.42,995.094,"With that, I just want to turn it over to Professor Reich to talk a little bit about he and the other professor engaged.",24,,
159,0.97,995.094,1001.233,"Yes, thank you Kerem.",25,,
160,0.97,1001.233,1002.668,It's an honor to address you all.,25,,
161,0.97,1002.668,1007.539,Our study drew on four different data sets.,25,,
162,0.97,1007.539,1010.943,They are listed in the slides.,25,,
163,0.97,1010.943,1014.847,I'll go over them in a different order.,25,,
164,0.97,1014.847,1020.753,"First of all, the city data, that give us a picture of the number of drivers, the number of trips.",25,,
165,0.97,1020.753,1029.661,"We drew from the Census Bureau, the U.S. Census Bureau which was enough of a sample in Seattle.",25,,
166,0.97,1029.661,1045.477,That identified drivers looking at primary occupation.,25,,
167,0.97,1045.477,1053.252,We conducted a survey and we got a very high response rate.,25,,
168,0.97,1053.252,1059.691,The survey went out to all the drivers in the city's Database.,25,,
169,0.97,1059.691,1065.397,"We asked Democratic questions, what kind of vehicles they had.",25,,
170,0.97,1065.397,1065.864,Expense questions.,25,,
171,0.97,1065.864,1067.733,How long they have been drivers.,25,,
172,0.97,1067.733,1071.503,And the earnings they got from their Apps.,25,,
173,0.97,1071.503,1086.919,"I should mention that their hours worked and earnings data don't come from their memory, but actually consulting the company's App.",25,,
174,0.97,1086.919,1093.425,These were all for reference in early December of 2019.,25,,
175,0.97,1093.425,1095.094,Obviously Pre-Covid.,25,,
176,0.97,1095.094,1102.601,"We also had some limited data from the TNC's, a little bit more from Uber.",25,,
177,0.97,1102.601,1107.639,They were not very responsive to the request for data.,25,,
178,0.97,1107.639,1119.051,"What we found very briefly, the drivers are more likely to be paid with a credit card.",25,,
179,0.97,1119.051,1122.054,87% or below the Federal poverty level.,25,,
180,0.97,1122.054,1124.756,Over half are under Medicaid or are uninsured.,25,,
181,0.97,1124.756,1130.629,The other group is getting insurance mainly through spouses.,25,,
182,0.97,1130.629,1142.574,"Half of the drivers work for both companies, and about half of been driving for over two years, so they are very attached to this job.",25,,
183,0.97,1142.574,1145.878,One third of the drivers work 32 hours or more.,25,,
184,0.97,1145.878,1151.95,Those drivers provide 55% of the tips.,25,,
185,0.97,1151.95,1158.257,"Although there is a common picture that most of the drivers are casual drivers, they are doing this as a side hustle.",25,,
186,0.97,1158.257,1170.202,"In fact, most of the work is being done by people who either work full-time, 32 hours or more, or intermediate time, like 20 to 32 hours.",25,,
187,0.97,1170.202,1177.509,A large amount of the drivers rely on driving as a sole source of income.,25,,
188,0.97,1177.509,1179.278,It is not just a side hustle.,25,,
189,0.97,1179.278,1191.523,"83% of the full-time drivers, 75% Intermediate, have purchased the vehicle primarily to drive for the companies.",25,,
190,0.97,1191.523,1200.499,"That provides you a picture, I think it is a more rounded picture them some of the other publicity about the drivers.",25,,
191,0.97,1200.499,1202.901,Next slide please.,25,,
192,0.97,1202.901,1212.244,"So, as the deputy Mayor mentioned, it's really important to understand the expenses the drivers had.",25,,
193,0.97,1212.244,1215.347,They're not fully paid and reimbursed for those expenses now.,25,,
194,0.97,1215.347,1219.618,We broke down the expenses into the categories you see on the slide.,25,,
195,0.97,1219.618,1238.07,"The acquisition costs, the operating costs, licensing and registration, payroll taxes that have to be paid by independent contractors, and we went into some detail, which is I think it important to know.",25,,
196,0.97,1238.07,1250.082,"Not just fuel, but insurance, having a cell phone, cleaning the vehicle on a regular basis.",25,,
197,0.97,1250.082,1252.784,We provided small but meaningful allowances for each of those.,25,,
198,0.97,1252.784,1257.99,We determined that the average expenses are $11.80 per hour.,25,,
199,0.97,1257.99,1274.606,"That is based on a full-time driver and these expenses are calculated with full-time drivers, or rather for drivers who drive 35,000 miles per year, which is really a full-time driver.",25,,
200,0.97,1274.606,1285.417,"Then, we use that hourly rate as estimated expenses for Part- time and casual drivers as well.",25,,
201,0.97,1285.417,1292.124,"The same for real costs, wear and tear costs on their vehicles, not just fuel costs.",25,,
202,0.97,1292.124,1293.925,Even if they are driving 10 hours a week.,25,,
203,0.97,1293.925,1300.232,The earnings are measured relative to driver working time.,25,,
204,0.97,1300.232,1303.502,Not just the P3 time.,25,,
205,0.97,1303.502,1315.447,Our result is that drivers gross and average of $21.53 per hour before expenses.,25,,
206,0.97,1315.447,1318.116,That is to say that is their gross pay.,25,,
207,0.97,1318.116,1325.657,"If you take out the $11.80 of the average expenses, it gets a little bit below $10 as their net pay.",25,,
208,0.97,1325.657,1328.627,Well below the city's minimum wage standard.,25,,
209,0.97,1328.627,1336.968,"Of course, there are lots of inequalities within the driver workforce.",25,,
210,0.97,1336.968,1347.546,"Some drivers get paid more than average, some get paid less than average, and we find that part-time drivers in particular get paid less than average per hour.",25,,
211,0.97,1347.546,1349.381,Okay.,25,,
212,0.97,1349.381,1355.253,Does that go back to --,25,,
213,0.97,1355.253,1360.425,"Rachel, if you would like to take over to talk about outreach.",26,,
214,0.97,1360.425,1361.793,Thank you.,27,,
215,0.97,1361.793,1370.702,"As was mentioned, in addition to the economic survey, we also wanted to ensure we heard directly from drivers themselves.",27,,
216,0.97,1370.702,1374.406,And that our engagement strategies were what we deemed to be driver centered.,27,,
217,0.97,1374.406,1381.88,"As we know, time not driving equals money not being made for these drivers.",27,,
218,0.97,1381.88,1385.917,"Therefore, we wanted to ensure we created equitable access to opportunities to engage with us during this research.",27,,
219,0.97,1385.917,1402.0,"The five methods you see here are focused on gathering qualitative data to center driver voice, and give context or meaning to the more numerical, or quantitative data, captured in the economic survey.",27,,
220,0.97,1402.0,1407.706,"The first thing we did was intercept interviews, which allowed us to meet drivers where they are.",27,,
221,0.97,1407.706,1415.814,"How we did this was we actually utilized the community liaison program, through the city's Department of neighborhoods.",27,,
222,0.97,1415.814,1421.72,Community liaisons could meet drivers in language.,27,,
223,0.97,1421.72,1424.055,These interviews were conducted in eight languages that you see here.,27,,
224,0.97,1424.055,1439.371,"We also conducted Roundtable discussions, with provided Stakeholder, or driver Stakeholder organizations, to organize their own drivers, so they could share their own unique perspectives of the organization.",27,,
225,0.97,1439.371,1447.078,"Next, we do focus groups, which enabled us to speak to more drivers that once, with the ability to follow a line of discussion through a neutral Facilitator.",27,,
226,0.97,1447.078,1463.762,"Also, a telephone town hall, with an emphasis on the telephone, because they want to again, did not want to disrupt drivers, and wanted them to have an opportunity to engage with us, even if they were making the a break or done for the day.",27,,
227,0.97,1463.762,1474.706,"Lastly, we did an Online survey, which was really just to cast a larger net toward the end of our outreach to both validate or invalidate things that we had heard through other methods.",27,,
228,0.97,1474.706,1478.577,"I want to point out that we had heard over 10,000 responses.",27,,
229,0.97,1478.577,1491.49,"Though these are not unique, because drivers had an opportunity to participate in more than one method, out of the 33,000 drivers, we think that was a pretty great target for this outreach.",27,,
230,0.97,1491.49,1497.429,Next slide please.,27,,
231,0.97,1497.429,1514.112,"So, the key findings that we heard throughout the outreach, O the themes that emerged I responses to all methods, the first we heard was that overwhelmingly, drivers need higher, fairer pay.",27,,
232,0.97,1514.112,1517.349,Drivers express the ability to earn greater more consistent pay as being highly desirable.,27,,
233,0.97,1517.349,1529.361,"Factors which we spoke to a little bit, and the economic Úsurvey as well, that Contribut to this inadequacy, are the high driving cost expenses.",27,,
234,0.97,1529.361,1534.566,"Uncompensated travel times to and from drives, as we have spoken to, in the different phases of driving time.",27,,
235,0.97,1534.566,1542.774,"Personal financial pressures, such as housing costs are personal health insurance also contribute to that.",27,,
236,0.97,1542.774,1545.377,"Second, we heard driver pay is inconsistent and unpredictable.",27,,
237,0.97,1545.377,1556.788,"So, drivers's ability to operate more flexibly as perceived, is severely hindered by the lack of transparency is from TNC's.",27,,
238,0.97,1556.788,1577.108,"As a result, drivers are unable to do things like anticipate earnings in advance, understand the breakdown of a fair for any given ride, have a say in fair or Commission structures, taken from the TNC's, and also understandings behind the Reasonings for often unwarranted the Activations.",27,,
239,0.97,1577.108,1581.78,"Lastly, we heard that drivers really needed safety nets.",27,,
240,0.97,1581.78,1599.431,"Due to high risk of being deactivated from the platform, often suddenly, and the risk of injury from being on the road more often, and sometimes in unsafe conditions, drivers desire some level of protection for those times when they are unable to drive or enforce unemployment.",27,,
241,0.97,1599.431,1609.407,"Drivers spoke to benefits such as paid sick leave, unemployment benefits, or workers compensation, as they thought those would help guarantee some access to income during times they cannot work.",27,,
242,0.97,1609.407,1619.517,"The legislation may not address these exact benefits, the hope is that the increase in pay standard, would help to make building a safety net such as this a more viable option.",27,,
243,0.97,1619.517,1624.756,Thank you.,27,,
244,0.97,1624.756,1631.93,"Michael, do you want to say a few words about the different components of the pay standard?",28,,
245,0.97,1631.93,1632.964,Or should I?,28,,
246,0.97,1632.964,1636.434,I think I already covered most of that.,29,,
247,0.97,1636.434,1637.435,Let's move on.,29,,
248,0.97,1637.435,1645.744,I'll just introduce how the Proposer is structured.,30,,
249,0.97,1645.744,1653.485,"There are two components to how the Mayor's proposal would guarantee a minimum pay scale, a minimum compensation standard for drivers.",30,,
250,0.97,1653.485,1654.886,One is a time component.,30,,
251,0.97,1654.886,1660.925,A permanent requirement the drivers must be paid on their trips.,30,,
252,0.97,1660.925,1662.594,And a mileage component.,30,,
253,0.97,1662.594,1666.464,"S, per mile component.",30,,
254,0.97,1666.464,1674.406,"The number you will see on the next screen, is based on the factors you see on this slide.",30,,
255,0.97,1674.406,1677.208,The time is simply the Seattle schedule one minimum wage.,30,,
256,0.97,1677.208,1679.477,The large employer minimum wage.,30,,
257,0.97,1679.477,1691.423,The mileage components are all of the elements that professor Reich analyzed and developed a per mile cost number four.,30,,
258,0.97,1691.423,1703.234,"Everything you see on the screen, the cost of acquiring and financing a vehicle, gas, maintenance, and one thing I want to call out in particular, it does include a component for health insurance.",30,,
259,0.97,1703.234,1710.842,"The report also has a number of additional cost elements, which Council asked us to eliminate.",30,,
260,0.97,1710.842,1715.013,That's available for Council to look at in their own policy process.,30,,
261,0.97,1715.013,1722.454,"Those additional items are not in the Mayor's proposal, but they are therefore now.",30,,
262,0.97,1722.454,1725.356,So.,30,,
263,0.97,1725.356,1728.727,Let me move on to how the minimum pay standard is structured.,30,,
264,0.97,1728.727,1733.865,"As I mentioned, there is a time and mileage component.",30,,
265,0.97,1733.865,1739.17,It requires a per minute rate of 0.56 cents.,30,,
266,0.97,1739.17,1741.372,And a per mile rate of $1.17.,30,,
267,0.97,1741.372,1753.985,"These requirements only apply to time and miles traveled during P3, when a driver has a passenger in the car.",30,,
268,0.97,1753.985,1758.89,We spent quite a bit of time on the front end saying how important it was to pay drivers for all of their time.,30,,
269,0.97,1758.89,1764.395,"So, the P3 number is actually increased by the percentage of time when a driver does not have a passenger in the car.",30,,
270,0.97,1764.395,1773.304,To make sure they are paid for all of their time.,30,,
271,0.97,1773.304,1775.106,"So, the divers explained this a little bit more.",30,,
272,0.97,1775.106,1778.81,If you take the minimum wage rate of $16.39 and divided by 60 to get a permanent rate.,30,,
273,0.97,1778.81,1779.611,It is not $.56.,30,,
274,0.97,1779.611,1780.411,It is actually $.27.,30,,
275,0.97,1780.411,1786.918,"The pay standard that increase that amount, would cover the amount of time they don't have a passenger.",30,,
276,0.97,1786.918,1790.188,It's roughly a factor of two to ensure they are paid for all of their time.,30,,
277,0.97,1790.188,1793.224,The same principle applies for the mileage number.,30,,
278,0.97,1793.224,1796.027,With slightly different numbers.,30,,
279,0.97,1796.027,1805.003,"There is a few reasons we do it that way, but the primary one is that drivers are currently paid only for P3.",30,,
280,0.97,1805.003,1808.039,We wanted to maintain a similar pay structure so as to avoid confusion for drivers.,30,,
281,0.97,1808.039,1814.546,We would hope it would also be a little bit easier for the TNC's to implement as well.,30,,
282,0.97,1814.546,1823.254,That's the core components of how they should be Structurd under the Mayor's proposal.,30,,
283,0.97,1823.254,1828.96,I want to spend just a minute talking about what this means in Real-World terms.,30,,
284,0.97,1828.96,1835.266,"This chart has a number of trips, typical trips that we modeled.",30,,
285,0.97,1835.266,1841.172,"It indicates the current pay drivers received, and what they should receive for that same trip under the proposed minimum compensation standard.",30,,
286,0.97,1841.172,1850.882,"Just one nuance, is that current pay, drivers actually make a range depending on their tenure with the company.",30,,
287,0.97,1850.882,1854.352,"Newer drivers make less, and legacy drivers make a little bit more.",30,,
288,0.97,1854.352,1857.188,We used the legacy numbers for the highest possible pay in this chart.,30,,
289,0.97,1857.188,1861.893,"I'm not going to run through every scenario here, just the top two.",30,,
290,0.97,1861.893,1866.965,"Capitol Hill to downtown, we monitored during Pre-Covered brush are.",30,,
291,0.97,1866.965,1869.801,12 minutes at 1.4 miles.,30,,
292,0.97,1869.801,1872.403,Currently they make about $5.18.,30,,
293,0.97,1872.403,1874.639,That could go up to about $8.36.,30,,
294,0.97,1874.639,1880.178,"Downtown to the airport, that is done just that in every time.",30,,
295,0.97,1880.178,1886.618,"25 minutes, 14.8 miles.",30,,
296,0.97,1886.618,1887.685,Current pay is about $25.59.,30,,
297,0.97,1887.685,1889.32,It should go up to $31.31.,30,,
298,0.97,1889.32,1908.74,"Two more tips also modeled at Rush-Hour times, Intra-Downtown, and then--so, with that, Michael I think you were going to say a couple more words about the impact on driver pay.",30,,
299,0.97,1908.74,1913.044,More generally.,30,,
300,0.97,1913.044,1917.849,Can you hear me now?,31,,
301,0.97,1917.849,1919.15,Yes.,32,,
302,0.97,1919.15,1923.755,"Very quickly, because I know we are short on time.",33,,
303,0.97,1923.755,1933.164,"We estimate that with this pay standard, driver gross pay will increase 30%.",33,,
304,0.97,1933.164,1939.07,"About $21.50 per hour, to $28.20 per hour.",33,,
305,0.97,1939.07,1943.942,"That means that net pay, after expenses, will actually go up 60%.",33,,
306,0.97,1943.942,1950.148,We calculated the gross pay because that is the--reflects the increased cost of companies.,33,,
307,0.97,1950.148,1957.755,We wanted to see how much that would affect their business.,33,,
308,0.97,1957.755,1961.192,"Before I turn to that, let me say that 84% of the drivers will receive pay increases.",33,,
309,0.97,1961.192,1967.899,That is to say the 16% were already making over this standard.,33,,
310,0.97,1967.899,1973.404,"A very, very large majority would see increases.",33,,
311,0.97,1973.404,1976.207,"The question, what is the effect on the industry?",33,,
312,0.97,1976.207,1994.125,"The important thing to note here is that if the companies take about 30% off the top, for their Commission, this is a very high percentage for multi platform Technologies.",33,,
313,0.97,1994.125,2012.21,"It could easily go down to 15%, as it already has for delivery companies in Seattle and New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco.",33,,
314,0.97,2012.21,2015.246,They would not want to do this on their own.,33,,
315,0.97,2015.246,2027.025,"If they are mandated to pay higher pay, they might decide it's better to reduce their excessive compensation, Commission levels.",33,,
316,0.97,2027.025,2039.57,Or rather a Commission decreased to 15% would mean that passenger fares would go up about 5%.,33,,
317,0.97,2039.57,2045.676,"That would have maybe 1% to 2% at most, effect on demand for rides.",33,,
318,0.97,2045.676,2048.146,Of course this was all Pre- Covid figures.,33,,
319,0.97,2048.146,2056.087,"It would really not effect demand for drives, and the drivers would still be better off.",33,,
320,0.97,2056.087,2062.56,We estimate their overall pay would go up about $100 million for the city of Seattle.,33,,
321,0.97,2062.56,2070.701,"Then, just to finish, there is another study that a lot of you have heard about that was commissioned by the TNC's.",33,,
322,0.97,2070.701,2077.175,"I wanted to emphasize not the differences between ours and theirs, but the similarities.",33,,
323,0.97,2077.175,2085.516,"Those studies indicate that a lot of drivers are being paid less than the pay standard, so the pay standard is necessary.",33,,
324,0.97,2085.516,2091.622,That's the most important conclusion in the findings of both studies.,33,,
325,0.97,2091.622,2106.637,"Also, the TNC's study finds it doesn't really matter in each of the studies whether you count the full-time drivers, a little bit more, or the Part- time drivers a little bit more.",33,,
326,0.97,2106.637,2109.507,We find the part-time drivers are paid less than full-time drivers.,33,,
327,0.97,2109.507,2117.582,"So, the TNC's, are trying to claim that we are spending too much emphasis on the full-time drivers.",33,,
328,0.97,2117.582,2124.121,It doesn't really have any impact on what the overall level of driver pay is.,33,,
329,0.97,2124.121,2131.362,"If we had waited the part-time drivers more, they would actually find lower levels of pay.",33,,
330,0.97,2131.362,2136.467,That's it.,33,,
331,0.97,2136.467,2141.372,"Okay, I know we are very short on time.",34,,
332,0.97,2141.372,2149.28,I'll just make the last slide debris these are just some additional provisions that we will include in the proposed legislation.,34,,
333,0.97,2149.28,2156.387,"Protection for tips, no tip credit permitted for the minimum compensation requirements.",34,,
334,0.97,2156.387,2159.257,Detailed transparency provisions.,34,,
335,0.97,2159.257,2162.894,Drivers and passengers will know what is happening.,34,,
336,0.97,2162.894,2168.399,"A proposed effective date of January 1st, 2021.",34,,
337,0.97,2168.399,2171.202,I'll leave it at that.,34,,
338,0.97,2171.202,2172.97,So there is time for any questions.,34,,
339,0.97,2172.97,2178.109,Thank you so much folks for that thorough presentation.,35,,
340,0.97,2178.109,2182.613,"Colleagues, we are short three Councilmembers this morning.",35,,
341,0.97,2182.613,2192.723,I think that gives us a little bit of cushion to allow time for some questions.,35,,
342,0.97,2192.723,2207.004,"For those Councilmembers who are with us this morning that might have questions, please raise your hand or send me a message to let me know if you have a question.",35,,
343,0.97,2207.004,2208.806,I know that Councilmember Strauss had a question.,35,,
344,0.97,2208.806,2210.641,He is in the Queue.,35,,
345,0.97,2210.641,2218.549,"We will start out with Councilmember Strauss, and then colleagues, if any of you have additional questions, please let me know.",35,,
346,0.97,2218.549,2221.352,I see Councilmember Lewis has his hand up now as well.,35,,
347,0.97,2221.352,2222.019,Councilmember Strauss?,35,,
348,0.97,2222.019,2226.257,Thank you President Gonzalez.,36,,
349,0.97,2226.257,2234.565,"Thank you deputy Mayor, Ranganathan, Kerem, Dr. Reich, Rachel, thank you for your hard work.",36,,
350,0.97,2234.565,2239.67,We understand that you are transmitting this legislation this month.,36,,
351,0.97,2239.67,2253.284,"And that Councilmember Mosqueda and the President's office is working to find some dates in September, with the goal of passing this legislation before the 2021 budget session, is that still correct?",36,,
352,0.97,2253.284,2255.953,That's the plan.,37,,
353,0.97,2255.953,2257.154,"Spin the great, thank you.",37,,
354,0.97,2257.154,2264.695,"On slide four, I don't think we necessarily need to go back.",37,,
355,0.97,2264.695,2267.465,I was taking notes as we go through.,37,,
356,0.97,2267.465,2280.911,"Slide four mentioned about, there we go, thank you, Kerem.",37,,
357,0.97,2285.383,2289.82,Exactly.,37,,
358,0.97,2289.82,2295.893,Do you know how much more drivers are paying for Covid related costs at this point?,37,,
359,0.97,2295.893,2301.232,"Or, is this a variable that we are still investigating?",37,,
360,0.97,2301.232,2305.036,We don't.,38,,
361,0.97,2305.036,2322.953,"We know that there is some support from the TNC's related to this, but obviously there are drivers who are doing above and beyond to protect themselves and to protect passengers.",38,,
362,0.97,2322.953,2330.428,"I don't know if professor Reich has any insight, or if Kerem has anything to add.",38,,
363,0.97,2330.428,2338.369,We haven't specifically tracked those numbers in the city of Seattle.,38,,
364,0.97,2338.369,2340.438,The expense analysis was all Pre-Covid.,39,,
365,0.97,2340.438,2357.621,"We have done driver engagement after the release of the study, and just Anecdotally, drivers have said I'm spending an additional amount on hand Sanitizer and gloves and wiping down the surfaces that sort of thing.",39,,
366,0.97,2357.621,2358.889,There are additional costs.,39,,
367,0.97,2358.889,2367.398,I can't answer as to a quantified number.,39,,
368,0.97,2367.398,2378.409,"I appreciate both of those answers, and I understand this can be a complex piece of policy that we are navigating during uncertain times.",40,,
369,0.97,2378.409,2381.378,Do you know if we be able to have a ballpark figure by September?,40,,
370,0.97,2381.378,2387.585,Is this something we will have to continue to adjust and take back?,40,,
371,0.97,2387.585,2408.639,"I don't think we have the capacity to do another research effort that would give us a really clear number, but I think we could do individual driver engagement to try to get just sort of individual driver experience with that.",41,,
372,0.97,2408.639,2412.343,And relay that to Councilmembers.,41,,
373,0.97,2412.343,2413.144,That would be possible.,41,,
374,0.97,2413.144,2414.545,Thank you.,42,,
375,0.97,2414.545,2418.849,This leads right into my only other question which is on slides nine and 10.,42,,
376,0.97,2418.849,2441.338,"Speaking to the Stakeholder that you have done after your proposal was developed, could you share a little bit about--I just want to clarify, was this outreach done before the development of the proposal, or after, both, and will there be any outreach done between now and end of September?",42,,
377,0.97,2441.338,2449.68,"Rachel, do you want to talk about the outreach that was done prior?",43,,
378,0.97,2449.68,2452.55,I can follow up on the next piece.,43,,
379,0.97,2452.55,2457.655,Most of the engagements have been December through March.,44,,
380,0.97,2457.655,2464.762,December of 2019 through March of this year.,44,,
381,0.97,2464.762,2470.801,It did go to speaking to the policy if that was your question.,44,,
382,0.97,2470.801,2472.67,Do you mind clarifying for me?,44,,
383,0.97,2472.67,2478.776,Sorry for any confusion there.,45,,
384,0.97,2478.776,2484.882,"I oftentimes found that outreach is done before a policy is developed, and sometimes it isn't done once a policy is developed circling back.",45,,
385,0.97,2484.882,2496.794,"I was just hoping to clarify that once, I understand there was initial outreach, and was that outreach then done a second time was the policy draft was completed?",45,,
386,0.97,2496.794,2504.935,"Yeah, I can speak to that unless deputy Mayor, you want to say something.",46,,
387,0.97,2504.935,2506.604,We have done a significant amount of engagement.,46,,
388,0.97,2506.604,2518.015,"We have circled back with both of the two largest companies, and there are three primary driver groups in Seattle.",46,,
389,0.97,2518.015,2523.053,We have engaged each of them on the contours of the policy proposal.,46,,
390,0.97,2523.053,2536.567,We anticipate that that will continue on the technical aspects going forward as well.,46,,
391,0.97,2536.567,2538.869,Thank you.,47,,
392,0.97,2538.869,2541.338,I appreciate all of your hard work on this.,47,,
393,0.97,2541.338,2545.576,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,48,,
394,0.97,2545.576,2550.781,Just a couple of follow-ups on that before I handed over to Councilmember Lewis for additional questions.,48,,
395,0.97,2550.781,2578.909,"One of the questions that Councilmember Strauss asked, or a line of questioning that he had, was with regards to Covid- 19 related expenses, specifically to Ppe that is now sort of inherent to the business model of Uber and Lyft and other rights or companies.",48,,
396,0.97,2578.909,2584.615,I want to be really clear in my understanding about what's going to be included in the mirrors proposal and what is not going to be included.,48,,
397,0.97,2584.615,2619.116,"Based on your answer, it sounds like Covid-19 expenses related to Ppe, and dealing with the realities of being in a shared space with other folks outside of your household, that those expenses are not going to be included as part of the Mayor's proposal as it is currently structured and will be transmitted to the city Council, without that component.",48,,
398,0.97,2619.116,2632.129,"I'm not describing any sort of ill intent, I just want to get clear that is not going to be in there.",48,,
399,0.97,2632.129,2636.166,"I have sort of a line of another question, another follow-up question if it isn't going to be included.",48,,
400,0.97,2636.166,2637.668,I think your point is exactly.,49,,
401,0.97,2637.668,2638.035,It is fair.,49,,
402,0.97,2638.035,2640.27,The work that happened Pre- Covid.,49,,
403,0.97,2640.27,2645.943,We don't have a good Estimator of per mile costs on Ppe.,49,,
404,0.97,2645.943,2651.949,"As I alluded earlier, it also varies amongst the drivers themselves.",49,,
405,0.97,2651.949,2662.192,There are drivers who are really taking a lot of additional precautions to protect themselves and their passengers.,49,,
406,0.97,2662.192,2668.499,"So, I think that is fair.",49,,
407,0.97,2668.499,2671.635,"We tried to capture, there is a component on that expense side around cleaning.",49,,
408,0.97,2671.635,2676.974,"Again, that is the general cleaning of the vehicle.",49,,
409,0.97,2676.974,2680.01,Spin I appreciate that.,49,,
410,0.97,2680.01,2691.021,The reason it is not included is because there wasn't sufficient time to do the research.,50,,
411,0.97,2691.021,2701.398,"Obviously the research period as described by Rachel, Predated by many months, the realities of the Covid-19 pandemic.",50,,
412,0.97,2701.398,2713.811,"I just want to make sure that we are clear as we are evaluating your proposal, that we understand what is not included, and it can be one of those that is not included, and the motivation at the why it was not included.",50,,
413,0.97,2713.811,2723.587,What I'd like to avoid is heading down a path where we develop some misunderstanding about the motivation of why it wasn't included in the first place.,50,,
414,0.97,2723.587,2755.385,"Which leads me to my next follow-up question, which is, is there willingness amongst the Mayor to have ongoing conversations as a city council considers this policy proposal to develop some solution that would address the realities of Ppe needs for so long as Covid- 19 exists?",50,,
415,0.97,2755.385,2763.093,"If there is, I would be interested in having those conversations with you folks about sort of having to think through what some potential solutions might be.",50,,
416,0.97,2763.093,2775.272,"It will be helpful from me to hear from you all off-line, and less you are ready to describe now, what considerations you considered, but weren't prepared to propose at this juncture.",50,,
417,0.97,2775.272,2779.176,"I can say at a high level, yes.",51,,
418,0.97,2779.176,2784.481,"I believe we will have to sort through as Kerem alluded, there were some capacity constraints.",51,,
419,0.97,2784.481,2795.425,"I also think we need to understand what role, if any, the companies are playing in providing their drivers with Ppe.",51,,
420,0.97,2795.425,2797.494,If that is not clear.,51,,
421,0.97,2797.494,2801.532,We can circle back to your office with some options for consideration.,51,,
422,0.97,2801.532,2804.735,That's great.,52,,
423,0.97,2804.735,2818.749,I was thinking about initially as sort of some companies have begun the process of providing Ppe to their drivers.,52,,
424,0.97,2818.749,2824.521,I was just hoping to be able to have a conversation about what that might look like in terms of baking in a solution to this policy.,52,,
425,0.97,2824.521,2832.829,Thank you for that opportunity to continue to have conversations around that.,52,,
426,0.97,2832.829,2835.465,I think that is a shared concern amongst all of us.,52,,
427,0.97,2835.465,2837.267,Okay.,52,,
428,0.97,2837.267,2843.974,Let's go ahead and handed over now to Councilmember Lewis.,52,,
429,0.97,2843.974,2846.176,"There you are, I see you now.",52,,
430,0.97,2846.176,2854.551,"Colleagues, if any of you have any questions, please shoot me a message or raise your hand and I'm happy to call on you.",52,,
431,0.97,2854.551,2856.987,Councilmember Lewis please.,52,,
432,0.97,2856.987,2859.189,Thank you so much Madame President.,53,,
433,0.97,2859.189,2863.694,I think this is all great.,53,,
434,0.97,2863.694,2879.776,I'm really glad that we're jumping into setting this really critical floor to make this a more equitable corner of our economy that has really been extremely challenging for a lot of the drivers doing this work for a very long time.,53,,
435,0.97,2879.776,2880.978,This is all really great work.,53,,
436,0.97,2880.978,2881.979,I look forward to it.,53,,
437,0.97,2881.979,2907.738,"So much so that my question is about looking forward to continuing this work and extending it to other portions of the App based economy that goes beyond the ride share companies, but extends to companies that are doing deliveries, and other forms of App-Based labor.",53,,
438,0.97,2907.738,2914.845,"I wonder, I think there's a question mostly for the academics on the Palio.",53,,
439,0.97,2914.845,2933.897,"Looking forward to taking on work in those segments, of the economy, which have gotten even bigger during the Covid epidemic as people, or pandemic, as people are ordering more of these groceries and food and other things to try to maintain social distancing.",53,,
440,0.97,2933.897,2942.205,What do you envision from this work would be applicable to those sectors of the economy as well?,53,,
441,0.97,2942.205,2954.451,Where do you think there is additional questions that we would want to answer moving into set minimum pay standards nd benefit standards in those other App-Based sectors of the economy as well?,53,,
442,0.97,2954.451,2956.653,Spend,53,,
443,0.97,2956.653,2960.29,It's an excellent question.,54,,
444,0.97,2960.29,2962.359,Good point.,54,,
445,0.97,2962.359,2972.803,"Uber eats, the delivery division, generates more revenue for Uber Uber driving.",54,,
446,0.97,2972.803,2987.117,"So, it's not easy to answer your question because we have very little data about delivery network companies.",54,,
447,0.97,2987.117,2996.426,"My intuition is that like the TNC's, demand fluctuates enormously over the course of a day.",54,,
448,0.97,2996.426,3004.034,Obviously dinnertime for Takeout is much more of a Peek.,54,,
449,0.97,3004.034,3012.209,"Earlier, morning times, or mid afternoon, are probably less needed.",54,,
450,0.97,3012.209,3022.152,"There are more Dnc companies, and the drivers for those companies, at least in the past, drove less per week than they did for 1020S.",54,,
451,0.97,3022.152,3110.24,"I would note that Grubhub, which is I think the biggest such company, I'm sure it operates in Seattle, I would think the minimum pay standard I think there was a much understanding of the TNC business model.",54,,
452,0.97,3110.24,3112.108,That's why we started there.,54,,
453,0.97,3112.108,3124.254,I think there is opportunities to use this policies to be a building block.,54,,
454,0.97,3124.254,3128.091,Thank you for that additional information.,55,,
455,0.97,3128.091,3132.028,Any other questions from my colleagues?,55,,
456,0.97,3132.028,3142.572,Councilmember Herbold please?,55,,
457,0.97,3142.572,3144.341,You are working on that mute button.,55,,
458,0.97,3144.341,3146.243,I see you working on it.,55,,
459,0.97,3146.243,3148.778,Thank you so much.,56,,
460,0.97,3148.778,3169.599,"In response to the question from Councilmember Lewis, and the deputy Mayor Ranganathan's response, I'm happy to share with folks, I think it was in late 2017 the council passed resolution 31863.",56,,
461,0.97,3169.599,3193.323,"This specifically asked for a set of recommendations from Ols as well as the labor standards advisory committee, specifically on getting employment, and it was more focused on this question around Misclassification.",56,,
462,0.97,3193.323,3208.004,"The recommendations that came out last year, which is what I'm offering to share, there is a report out of Ols where they deal with a lot of these issues, specifically around, less about regulation around basic pay standards.",56,,
463,0.97,3208.004,3209.839,More around transparency.,56,,
464,0.97,3209.839,3218.348,People have a right to know what they are going to get paid.,56,,
465,0.97,3218.348,3222.786,"They have a right to know what their tip and service charge policies are, and the payment schedule.",56,,
466,0.97,3222.786,3230.66,"They have a right to know the rate, or rates of pay for the contractor.",56,,
467,0.97,3230.66,3232.028,Expenses incurred.,56,,
468,0.97,3232.028,3246.776,"It's a recommendation to require these employers to, in advance of employment, provide disclosure of the employee's rights.",56,,
469,0.97,3246.776,3248.979,I'd be happy to share that.,56,,
470,0.97,3248.979,3268.298,"This is an area that I have long felt that the Council needs to be more broadly engaged in, instead of--I really appreciate and value our efforts sector by sector, but I think there are some larger issues that cross all sectors in the gig economy.",56,,
471,0.97,3268.298,3273.603,"Outside of domestic workers, outside of TNC drivers.",56,,
472,0.97,3273.603,3281.678,"I look forward to working with the executive, and Ols, and the labor standards advisory Council on that as well.",56,,
473,0.97,3281.678,3282.112,Thank you.,56,,
474,0.97,3282.112,3285.582,Thank you.,57,,
475,0.97,3285.582,3289.586,Any other questions about this anticipated proposal?,57,,
476,0.97,3289.586,3291.688,Okay.,57,,
477,0.97,3291.688,3292.889,I am scanning the virtual room.,57,,
478,0.97,3292.889,3298.995,It does not appear that Councilmembers have any additional questions.,57,,
479,0.97,3298.995,3303.833,I had one quick question.,57,,
480,0.97,3303.833,3306.703,We don't need to pull the presentation backup since you just took it down.,57,,
481,0.97,3306.703,3318.048,"Really quickly, there was a reference to, and a lot of analysis in the presentation, about the calculation of the per hour earnings.",57,,
482,0.97,3318.048,3320.75,The hourly earnings that we saw.,57,,
483,0.97,3320.75,3328.458,"There was a constant reference to, it was that dollar amount per hour, minus expenses.",57,,
484,0.97,3328.458,3339.769,"I think it's important for the public record, to just define once again really quickly, what was included in the expenses.",57,,
485,0.97,3339.769,3367.997,"That is deducted from that estimated average hourly wage, and then if you could answer the second question, which is, is there anything Besides those expenses that we know also comes out of that per hour average of earnings?",57,,
486,0.97,3367.997,3374.104,I think that is directed to me.,58,,
487,0.97,3374.104,3381.411,"The expenses are pretty well detailed on that slide that Kerem just put up, thank you.",58,,
488,0.97,3381.411,3384.914,There's an even more detailed list in the Appendix of the report.,58,,
489,0.97,3384.914,3396.493,"It lists not only the individual items, but how much they are annually, weekly, and per mile.",58,,
490,0.97,3396.493,3416.813,"They include vehicle registration costs, motor vehicle excise tax, annual vehicle inspection, state business license, city business license, as well as the vehicle acquisition, gas, maintenance, insurance, cell phone and cleaning.",58,,
491,0.97,3416.813,3422.252,"Each of those, we had to make some choices like how often does the vehicle need to be cleaned?",58,,
492,0.97,3422.252,3424.654,That's behind these numbers.,58,,
493,0.97,3424.654,3431.227,They are all documented as well as we can.,58,,
494,0.97,3431.227,3433.797,I should say one of the largest elements is vehicle acquisition.,58,,
495,0.97,3433.797,3454.784,"You can think of this as also any driver, even if they already have a car, if they are adding miles to the car, they're going to have to replace the car sooner than they were if they weren't driving for a TNC.",58,,
496,0.97,3454.784,3457.654,We went around a lot of different ways to estimate what those costs are.,58,,
497,0.97,3457.654,3468.798,"We used financing, we used leasing costs, we could use depreciation allowances from the Internal Revenue service.",58,,
498,0.97,3468.798,3478.107,"We came up to I think, with $.52 per mile.",58,,
499,0.97,3478.107,3482.378,"I think we went about it quite conservatively, what expenses might be.",58,,
500,0.97,3482.378,3495.124,"Of course, you could say that some of the really casual drivers, might not even incur these expenses in a meaningful amount.",58,,
501,0.97,3495.124,3501.498,I just don't think it's worth allowing them to be reimbursed for this small expense.,58,,
502,0.97,3501.498,3503.833,Thank you.,59,,
503,0.97,3503.833,3513.243,It's exhibit 28 in our report.,60,,
504,0.97,3513.243,3515.111,I appreciate that reference.,61,,
505,0.97,3515.111,3520.817,I wanted to make sure we had an opportunity to hear you say it out loud.,61,,
506,0.97,3520.817,3527.924,Not many members of the public are going to go to the Appendix and the footnotes to read these granular details.,61,,
507,0.97,3527.924,3530.76,We will on the Council because we are policy Nerds at heart.,61,,
508,0.97,3530.76,3540.336,But not every member of the public is going to go into that level of diligence on the report.,61,,
509,0.97,3540.336,3542.539,I appreciate you taking the time to walk us through that.,61,,
510,0.97,3542.539,3558.588,"I think the important take away for me, as I reflect on your Reiteration of those points, is that the estimate that is included in the Mayor's proposal is our best estimate available to us right now based on the research that we have available to us.",61,,
511,0.97,3558.588,3567.664,I'm hearing from you that you took a conservative approach to come up with those hourly average hourly earnings numbers.,61,,
512,0.97,3567.664,3581.077,"Meaning that we could have been a little bit more aggressive in terms of discounting associated expenses from that average, but we chose not to do that in this context.",61,,
513,0.97,3581.077,3597.193,"Then, Lastly, that there may be categories of other expenses that we may have just not been able to capture because of the lack of available information and willingness of the Rideshare companies to share more information with us.",61,,
514,0.97,3597.193,3619.515,Leading us to doing the best we can to capture information from enough drivers to be able to come up with our own conclusions . I highlight this because I think that hourly number is obviously where the crux of the policy issues are.,61,,
515,0.97,3619.515,3638.167,"I think it's important for us all to have a good understanding of how you all came up with some of those data points as the Council prepares to come after Recess, to dig into the granular details of the policy proposal.",61,,
516,0.97,3638.167,3641.637,Did I Miss state anything or does anything have to be clarified based on my Takeaways?,61,,
517,0.97,3641.637,3656.486,"I would just add that our questions about costs, or investigation, were much more complications than what they TNC's list when they look at expenses.",62,,
518,0.97,3656.486,3664.794,The study listed by the TNC's is a much shorter list.,62,,
519,0.97,3664.794,3668.664,"For example, I don't think they talk about cell phones or cell plans, or vehicle cleaning and so forth.",62,,
520,0.97,3668.664,3674.971,"While I'd say ours is considerably more detailed, it is trying to capture all the costs.",62,,
521,0.97,3674.971,3679.409,The list comes from talking to drivers.,62,,
522,0.97,3679.409,3686.916,"Those, in New York City, where we first did this kind of cost modeling, and hearing from Seattle drivers as well.",62,,
523,0.97,3686.916,3689.318,"Great, thank you.",63,,
524,0.97,3689.318,3690.219,Appreciate that.,63,,
525,0.97,3690.219,3701.397,Any other comments from folks from our guest Preventers?,63,,
526,0.97,3701.397,3705.835,Deputy Mayor I don't know if you want to make any closing remarks before we close out this portion of the agenda.,63,,
527,0.97,3705.835,3712.341,Just that we are looking forward to transmitting the proposal.,64,,
528,0.97,3712.341,3717.213,There is a lag simply because we have to resolve some technical elements related to the legislation itself.,64,,
529,0.97,3717.213,3722.518,We are working on that.,64,,
530,0.97,3722.518,3726.355,"Councilmember, I just want to once again acknowledge your point around Ppe costs.",64,,
531,0.97,3726.355,3740.57,"We will be circling back with your office on kind of how to be think about that, and what additional work we need to do with the companies to get a better understanding of what they are, what they need to potentially be covering as this policy is developed.",64,,
532,0.97,3740.57,3742.772,"Great, thank you so much.",65,,
533,0.97,3742.772,3747.877,Really appreciate that Follow- up.,65,,
534,0.97,3747.877,3757.253,"Okay, colleagues, I think that concludes our presentation on the TNC proposed legislation that the Council will be receiving later this month.",66,,
535,0.97,3757.253,3759.255,Before we begin our policy work on it.,66,,
536,0.97,3759.255,3771.667,"I think the deputy Mayor and the Presenters, both Rachel, and Kerem, and also Dr. Reich for giving us this presentation this morning.",66,,
537,0.97,3771.667,3773.503,Really appreciate all of your hard work.,66,,
538,0.97,3773.503,3780.576,Obviously there was a lot of hard work that went into play in this presentation before it got to us.,66,,
539,0.97,3780.576,3790.686,"The underlying policy, we look forward to, as I'm sure all of my colleagues do, look forward to digging into the details once we get the actual legislation.",66,,
540,0.97,3790.686,3795.525,We look forward to the legislative process that will unfold related to this particular issue.,66,,
541,0.97,3795.525,3798.194,You all for being with us.,66,,
542,0.97,3798.194,3804.333,Really appreciate it.,66,,

561,0.97,3890.219,3903.499,"This is my first bill that I developed here at Council, which we started working on in January . As you can tell, the bills take a very long time because of the public notice and public input requirements.",70,,
562,0.97,3903.499,3911.073,This bill simply changes the conditional permit aspect of Childcare facilities.,70,,
563,0.97,3911.073,3928.658,"So, there remains a primary permitting process, and state licensing, to ensure that facilities are citing correctly, and constructed and operate within our regulations to ensure that Childcare is provided with the quality, inequality setting.",70,,
564,0.97,3928.658,3930.159,I will speak more on full council.,70,,

575,0.97,4000.596,4005.634,"I did receive a report from them last week, that they have started doing virtual meetings for the design review process.",70,,
576,0.97,4005.634,4011.707,It does take an additional staff member who runs the meeting behind everyone else who is already conducting their business.,70,,
577,0.97,4011.707,4013.142,Much like we have here.,70,,
578,0.97,4013.142,4015.611,We have our I.T.,70,,

583,0.97,4028.958,4038.367,Next speak way too cheap best's retirement.,71,,
584,0.97,4038.367,4039.802,It is a tremendous loss to our city.,71,,
585,0.97,4039.802,4043.439,"Our actions here at City Council were not intended to be personal, and we absolutely value her work.",71,,
586,0.97,4043.439,4048.277,It's clear the intent was not the impact that was felt.,71,,
587,0.97,4048.277,4054.784,"When policy is viewed in a vacuum, we oftentimes Miss the soft variables which are critical to this work.",71,,
588,0.97,4054.784,4065.694,"Our actions were never intended to be personal, and my actions were never intended to be personal, and I am sorry for that.",71,,

595,0.97,4093.622,4104.333,"In regards to small businesses, I was working with small businesses on Ballard Avenue in the farmers market in regards to our cafe streets.",72,,
596,0.97,4104.333,4108.637,I believe we are very close to having consensus on how we as a neighborhood can move forward on this proposal.,72,,
597,0.97,4108.637,4111.407,I know there are proposals occurring in other parts of our city already.,72,,

600,0.97,4123.452,4129.258,I also understand that we have had an epidemic conversation about this for a very long time.,72,,
601,0.97,4129.258,4131.16,I believe about 18 months.,72,,
602,0.97,4131.16,4135.664,We need to try this with a pilot to actually understand that Scooters are appropriate in Seattle.,72,,
603,0.97,4135.664,4138.467,We need to do this before the rainy darkness returns.,72,,
604,0.97,4138.467,4140.736,This is why it's important that we move forward this week.,72,,
605,0.97,4140.736,4146.041,"If we try this, and it doesn't work, then we can pull it back and we can stop.",72,,
606,0.97,4146.041,4158.187,We need to move forward with this now to answer the academic questions outside of the vacuum of policy and test the program in real life.,72,,
607,0.97,4158.187,4160.389,"Thank you Council President, that is my report.",72,,
608,0.97,4160.389,4164.193,Any comments or questions for Councilmember Strauss?,73,,

612,0.97,4179.708,4201.83,"I really appreciate your remarks this morning, as well as last week, and the fact that I believe every Councilmember issued a statement, either alone, or in concert with other Councilmembers, is really a strong indication of the import of this decision that the chief has made.",74,,
613,0.97,4201.83,4227.456,"It shows the fact that we are recognizing the fact that, regardless of our intent, to personalize our issues, that the reception of our recommendations may be different than our intent.",74,,
614,0.97,4227.456,4252.881,"Again, I just want to say, I know that Councilmembers feel different, but we all I think really understand the significance of this action and the significance to our community . particularly our black and Brown community.",74,,

654,0.97,4558.554,4569.264,"So, that particular change also impacts some of the questions around Preemption of the juvenile justice act of 1977.",76,,
655,0.97,4569.264,4586.848,"The clarification that the language around the Admissibility of evidence in court, addresses some of the issues that there may have been some concern around the juvenile justice act of 1977.",76,,
656,0.97,4586.848,4598.393,"Finally, again, the reference to the private right of action in the memo that we have received over the weekend.",76,,
657,0.97,4598.393,4618.513,"This particular bill does not contemplate a specific designated, enshrined right, a private lawsuit for failure to adhere to the law in this version of the bill.",76,,
658,0.97,4618.513,4623.051,It removed the session due to concerns we received from the city attorney's office.,76,,
659,0.97,4623.051,4631.293,Moving on to other items related to the public safety and human services committee.,77,,
660,0.97,4631.293,4646.274,"I think folks are aware that on Friday, the community police Commission, the inspector general, and the office of police accountability all set reports to the Council regarding the use of crowd control weapons.",77,,
661,0.97,4646.274,4649.978,As requested in the Council legislation adopted on June 15th.,77,,
662,0.97,4649.978,4665.394,District Court judge will Barton approved a temporary restraining order on implementation of the Council's ordinance that was requested by the U.S. Department of justice due to the 2012 consent decree.,77,,
663,0.97,4665.394,4671.7,This temporary restraining order was extended to September 18th.,77,,
664,0.97,4671.7,4692.988,"In our ordinance, we requested that these three accountability ordinances, accountability bodies, as mentioned, the CPC, the inspector general, and OPA, would give us their input on the recommendations, but also that they would send that input to the judge.",77,,
665,0.97,4692.988,4707.636,"So, the new information that folks may be interested to learn is that the Council will be represented by separate outside Council in the case.",77,,
666,0.97,4707.636,4709.905,Before the judge.,77,,
667,0.97,4709.905,4726.354,"During neural hearings, a couple weeks ago, he raised significant concerns about conflicts in the city attorney's office, participating both in the defense of the ordinance, given the city attorney's previous arguments.",77,,
668,0.97,4726.354,4732.527,"So, the court has laid out a process for the Department of justice to file a motion for preliminary injunction by August 27th.",77,,
669,0.97,4732.527,4745.24,With a city response due to the court on September 8th with any Department of justice replied to by September 11th.,77,,
670,0.97,4745.24,4750.278,This is intended to allow the court to address this before September 18th.,77,,
671,0.97,4750.278,4770.098,"Also, keep in mind, that completely separate from the city's ordinance, black lives matter, and the ACLU requested a temporary restraining order that the court approved back onto 13th that limits the use of crowd control devices at protests.",77,,
672,0.97,4770.098,4778.106,The city agreed to extend a preliminary injunction limiting the use of crowd control devices through September 30th.,77,,
673,0.97,4778.106,4796.024,"A week ago, agreed to expand this still further, to limit the use of chemical areas or projectiles, and specifically called out a prohibition on use against and less, legal observers, and medics.",77,,
674,0.97,4796.024,4800.896,Declaring a riot does not exempt the city from its obligation under the order.,77,,
675,0.97,4800.896,4817.946,"Going back to the recommendations of the three accountability bodies, on our ordinance, it's important to recognize that their recommendations come from different perspectives, in line with their responsibilities as accountability bodies.",77,,
676,0.97,4817.946,4828.323,"The OPA recommendations, partially come from the perspective of reviewing the complaints filed.",77,,
677,0.97,4828.323,4835.363,The Office of the inspector general really focuses on the structural issues in the police Department's policies as compared to other law enforcement agencies.,77,,
678,0.97,4835.363,4841.67,The CPC's perspective focuses in part on the effective policing policies on the community's trust.,77,,
679,0.97,4841.67,4857.419,"The issues raised regarding the Council's ordinance from these three accountability bodies includes the use of these devices in situations where there are no issues of crowd control, as well as the use of these devices during crowd control.",77,,
680,0.97,4857.419,4867.896,"All three bodies NOTE support for allowing the use of some lethal, some less lethal options outside of crowd control.",77,,
681,0.97,4867.896,4876.905,"The ordinance as written, defined for use of evidence and projectiles as crowd control devices no matter how they are used.",77,,
682,0.97,4876.905,4881.877,There is a Definitional issue with the construction of the ordinance itself.,77,,
683,0.97,4881.877,4895.123,"It basically Posits that all of these weapons are crowd control weapons, or crowd control devices no matter how they are used.",77,,
684,0.97,4895.123,4911.606,"So, the thing to just keep in mind is that the OPA and the Oig both proposed Reauthorizing the limited use of crowd control devices during crowd control situations when violence is present.",77,,
685,0.97,4911.606,4923.752,"The Office of the inspector general indicates that any reauthorization should be accompanied by changes in policy and training to reduce risk of harm, to nonviolent protesters.",77,,
686,0.97,4923.752,4927.622,And the OPA proposes conditions to minimize use.,77,,
687,0.97,4927.622,4935.563,"According to the current Timeline laid out by the judge, we can expect to hear from the court by September 18th.",77,,
688,0.97,4935.563,4953.982,"Again, given the late date of these recommendations, I believe we are going to be looking to get a little bit more time before we are required to submit our motion to the court.",77,,
689,0.97,4953.982,4970.298,Just a couple other items just want to share related to recommendations out of King County public health related to wearing masks during hot weather.,78,,
690,0.97,4970.298,4974.169,Their recommendations for preventing Coronavirus during hot weather like we are experiencing.,78,,
691,0.97,4974.169,4984.045,"Wearing a face covering of course is a key measure to prevent the spread of Covid, but in hot weather, where one can also contribute to overheating.",78,,
692,0.97,4984.045,4994.956,"So, the recommendation is to avoid spending time in hot indoor or outdoor spaces where you also need to wear a face covering.",78,,
693,0.97,4994.956,5001.429,"If you're in a public place and need to wear a face covering, take a safely distanced mask break if you're getting too hot and uncomfortable.",78,,
694,0.97,5001.429,5010.105,Make sure you go outside and are distanced from others by at least 6 feet when you're taking a mask break.,78,,
695,0.97,5010.105,5018.046,"Remove your facial covering to breathe and cool down, and put the mask back on before returning to the Venue or activity where the mask is required.",78,,
696,0.97,5018.046,5023.318,"Lastly there is going to be a free mask distribution event coming up on Thursday, August 20th.",79,,
697,0.97,5023.318,5033.261,You can pick up free masks in the Ranier Beach neighborhood and that goes from 1:00 to 5:00 P.M ..,79,,
698,0.97,5033.261,5035.263,This is for King County residents.,79,,
699,0.97,5035.263,5038.767,It's a drive to pick up event.,79,,
700,0.97,5038.767,5041.369,Interested residents can enter at the parking lot entrance.,79,,
701,0.97,5041.369,5048.376,"Tell the staff person the number of individuals in the household, and pick up some masks.",79,,

703,0.97,5050.145,5052.18,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",79,,
704,0.97,5052.18,5055.583,Really appreciate your report.,79,,
705,0.97,5055.583,5077.772,"I just wanted to clarify that a potential request for an extension would be related more in part to the fact that we have been, as a city Council, required to get new counsel.",79,,
706,0.97,5077.772,5081.81,And that that counsel came to us on Wednesday.,79,,
707,0.97,5081.81,5090.919,Our legal counsel needs an opportunity to catch up in order to provide us with their opportunities to respond.,79,,
708,0.97,5090.919,5114.742,"I just want to make sure that that colleagues understand what the motivation would be for asking for a potential extension in the event that you receive any inquiries from your constituents, or other members of the public . is that a fair characterization?",79,,
709,0.97,5114.742,5116.344,Thank you very much.,80,,
710,0.97,5116.344,5119.347,Thank you.,81,,
711,0.97,5119.347,5126.721,"Of course we have the reports that came from OPA, CPC, and Oig.",81,,
712,0.97,5126.721,5129.357,We also have an opportunity to dig deeper into those reports.,81,,
713,0.97,5129.357,5134.229,"And to reach out to each of the entities for questions, briefing.",81,,
714,0.97,5134.229,5155.95,"Any other information we might need in the interim between now and the court proceedings to get clarification . colleagues, you are all welcome to reach out to those particular entities, although that might be overwhelming to them.",81,,
715,0.97,5155.95,5184.579,"I would like to suggest that if you have questions about any three of the reports, that you look in coordination with my office and and Council central staff to catalog any stuff that folks might have two get those questions over to the accountability entities accordingly.",81,,
716,0.97,5184.579,5190.685,"Councilmember Herbold, does that sound like an okay process for you?",81,,
717,0.97,5190.685,5211.005,"In the absence of being able to invite folks to do everything, in briefings, giving our Recess, and given the timing, I think having some sort of a coordinated process to collect and receive answers to questions that Councilmembers may have is wise.",82,,
718,0.97,5211.005,5213.041,"Okay, thank you, I appreciate that.",83,,
719,0.97,5213.041,5218.446,We'll look to you and your office to get us coordinated in that fashion.,83,,
720,0.97,5218.446,5228.256,We'll also work to follow up with each of you in terms of next steps related to the court proceeding.,83,,
721,0.97,5228.256,5244.472,"I do want to say sort of setting aside the technical procedural items that I just finished discussing, I do want to say that I appreciate the accountability partners' hard work.",84,,
722,0.97,5244.472,5248.843,"And the production of their reports, consistent with the court's order.",84,,
723,0.97,5248.843,5260.355,I also want to say that I believe this is exactly how the accountability system was intended and designed to work.,84,,
724,0.97,5260.355,5290.218,"So, I appreciate the fact that they are taking a hard look from their particular lens through their particular statutory obligation in the accountability ordinance, and that they are providing voice about their concerns and their subject matter expertise is coming to bear through these reports and the conclusions they have provided to us.",84,,
725,0.97,5290.218,5308.102,"I believe that the Council will find that that kind of feedback Loop, will be very helpful and to be effective in shaping how we move forward here next.",84,,
726,0.97,5308.102,5318.846,"I really do appreciate all the hard work that the accountability entities, all three of them, did through the end of last week and look forward to continuing cooperation there.",84,,

731,0.97,5335.329,5339.367,Thank you Madam President.,85,,
732,0.97,5339.367,5345.473,There are no items on this afternoon's busy agenda from the select Committee on homeless and strategies and investments.,85,,
733,0.97,5345.473,5373.101,I do want to flag that I had been talking to some folks on the floor about potentially having a committee meeting this Wednesday to just do a little bit of communication with the public about some of the potential strategies with our social service provider partners that might fill the void of the navigation team leaving.,85,,
734,0.97,5373.101,5377.572,"I believe some of those strategies were, I don't believe, I know.",85,,
735,0.97,5377.572,5387.915,Some of those strategies were mentioned very ably in an editorial in the Seattle times recently by Allison icing and Cody grace.,85,,
736,0.97,5387.915,5401.929,Discussing the works that reach and others have been doing to provide outreach to our neighbors experiencing homelessness and living in on sanctions Encampments.,85,,
737,0.97,5401.929,5409.437,"Instead of doing a committee meeting, just given that we are gearing up to go on Recess, I will be doing a Townhall on Wednesday afternoon.",85,,
738,0.97,5409.437,5412.44,It will start at 3:30.,85,,
739,0.97,5412.44,5415.143,On zoom.,85,,

741,0.97,5422.65,5437.865,We will have a conversation about some of the strategies and partnerships we might look at developing in the fall to replace the outreach and other services that have been provided by the navigation team.,85,,
742,0.97,5437.865,5455.983,And to reflect the intent of this Council to move past the navigation team and try to invest in strategies that are more in line with what our service provider partners had been demanding for a long time.,85,,
743,0.97,5455.983,5459.987,"So, I'll be having that Townhall.",85,,
744,0.97,5459.987,5468.362,Members of the Council are certainly invited to join me.,85,,
745,0.97,5468.362,5489.484,I really look forward to those exchanges and think that will be a good opportunity for members of the public to hear an extended discussion about how we might be able to change some of our outreach practices and how that can be informed by the experience that these organizations have.,85,,
746,0.97,5489.484,5493.654,I'm going to send out details hopefully before the end of this morning about setting up that Townhall.,85,,
747,0.97,5493.654,5499.827,"Otherwise, I don't have any updates this morning.",85,,
748,0.97,5499.827,5516.911,"Beyond that, certainly looking forward to having a little bit of time during Recess to prepare for the fall budget session, and looking forward to another week of work here to finish some projects before we go up to Recess.",85,,

763,0.97,5596.924,5607.702,"Okay, hearing none, I would say that I think the resolution this afternoon is pretty noncontroversial.",88,,
764,0.97,5607.702,5618.846,It's just another step in moving us forward on this regionalized effort around addressing the system's issues related to our regional response to homelessness.,88,,
765,0.97,5618.846,5620.915,Look forward to supporting that resolution this afternoon.,88,,

777,0.97,5669.263,5678.205,"Which would delay for one year, the effective date of a heating oil tax that was adopted by Council in 2019.",91,,
778,0.97,5678.205,5693.22,The intent of the original ordinance was to tax heating oil to accelerate the rate of conversion from oil to electric heat pump systems.,91,,
779,0.97,5693.22,5706.2,"In response to community feedback about the impacts on the tax on low income and middle income households, particularly during Covid, the office of Sustainability and the environment is proposing we delay implementation of that tax for one year.",91,,
