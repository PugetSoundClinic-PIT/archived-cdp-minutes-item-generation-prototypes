49,0.97,268.067,279.879,We continue to receive the same copy and paste answer each time . I am asking for the city council's support to help my family find answers as to what happened to my brother.,15,,
50,0.97,279.879,285.518,The letter asks as PD to release my brother's records.,15,,
51,0.97,285.518,300.933,We have over 1800 signatures on a petition . There has been a complete lack of accountability.,15,,
52,0.97,300.933,310.343,Your support would be much appreciated.,15,,
53,0.97,310.343,315.415,All the family whose loved ones have been killed at the hands of Seattle police deserve accountability.,15,,

60,0.97,342.208,380.68,"As you just heard from Castille, trying to get unstuck . The fact that as PD has not been providing public records, Herbert Hightower Junior was a person of color, as were many of the 27 people killed by SPD in the last few years . They were all people of color and mental health crisis brandishing knives.",17,,
61,0.97,380.68,382.882,What is noticeable in all of these cases are two things.,17,,
62,0.97,382.882,386.285,Our current police accountability system has never provided answers or justice to their families or loved ones.,17,,
63,0.97,386.285,394.627,"The current changes to polymeric policy, those enacted and proposed by the Council would have made absolutely no difference in the outcome of these cases.",17,,
64,0.97,394.627,404.203,"Every one of these cases, an officer with a gun would have been called to the scene and an officer with a gun would have shot the person dead.",17,,
65,0.97,404.203,418.418,This doesn't happen in the United Kingdom . It happens routinely in the United States.,17,,
66,0.97,418.418,424.39,"It should also be noted that at this morning's Council briefing, it was incorrectly claimed that the Seattle police Department could not Prioritize the release of these public records.",17,,
67,0.97,424.39,425.324,That is simply not true.,17,,
68,0.97,425.324,436.669,The Washington administrative code actually says agency has flexibility to Prioritize its responses to be more sufficient all a Quester to.,17,,
69,0.97,436.669,453.352,An agency cannot simply Prioritize based on the content but they can Prioritize based on the simplicity of the request and in this case it is a very specific request.,17,,
70,0.97,453.352,457.089,"Again, we would ask the Council do everything in its power to make sure these records are released.",17,,
71,0.97,457.089,457.39,Thank you.,17,,
72,0.97,457.39,462.261,"Okay, next up is Dan Roche.",18,,
73,0.97,462.261,469.368,"I do have one Speaker, Jim Johnson who is registered but not showing as present.",18,,
74,0.97,469.368,473.473,"Dan Roche, please.",18,,
75,0.97,473.473,475.141,Thank you for allowing me to speak.,19,,
76,0.97,475.141,493.192,"My name is Dan Roche and I am here to support Casteel Hightower in finding out the information she needs to find for her brother, Herbert Hightower, so they can have closure for their family of five.",19,,
77,0.97,493.192,500.099,The Seattle police Department can't release the records . It should be a matter of public record.,19,,
78,0.97,500.099,513.045,It kind of reminds me of the invisible Institute's battle 10 years of court battles just to get the records for police misconduct.,19,,
79,0.97,513.045,521.02,We are having a struggle with having our elected officials and our police officers needing to be held accountable.,19,,
80,0.97,521.02,538.871,"I find it that if you are working as a public worker as far as servants for the public, you should be having transparency as your first rule.",19,,
81,0.97,538.871,564.664,The fact that we are struggling just to get a letter is outrageous . I want to thank Councilmember Sawant for all she does a fighting for justice for all of those that are being put up in the system we currently exist under.,19,,
82,0.97,564.664,577.677,"The fact that 1850 people have signed a petition to ask for them to release the records that affect these families and is still today we have not done it, we want to believe there is something to hide.",19,,
83,0.97,577.677,581.881,"If there is nothing to hide, it would be easy to be transparent.",19,,
84,0.97,581.881,599.665,I want to thank Councilmember Sawant and encourage everyone to keep fighting and keep resisting because the only way it is going to change if we all are involved and we demand change.,19,,
85,0.97,599.665,602.635,I want to thank you for your time and thank you for letting me speak.,19,,
86,0.97,602.635,605.304,Thank you for calling in today.,20,,

88,0.97,610.142,613.212,Just a moment.,20,,

119,0.97,756.989,765.764,This legislation would extend the existing moratorium for mobile home parks by an addiction all six months.,41,,
120,0.97,765.764,770.569,"We held a public hearing two weeks ago and did not pass this bill last week, as due to budget.",41,,
121,0.97,770.569,777.977,The budget took up most of our priority time.,41,,
122,0.97,777.977,779.979,"The city council first adopted as moratorium in January, 2019.",41,,
123,0.97,779.979,780.98,It has renewed it twice.,41,,
124,0.97,780.98,793.793,"The current moratorium is enacted and expires on January 8th . an extension requires 30 days to take effect, which is why it is before us today.",41,,

152,0.97,952.451,959.758,I asked the clerk to call the roll to confirm which Councilmembers signatures need to be affixed to it.,56,,
153,0.97,959.758,975.04,"First we will go ahead and hear from Councilmember Sawant in terms of the letter that I just described, and then we will go ahead and open it up for discussion and any additional questions before I ask the clerk to call the roll.",56,,
154,0.97,975.04,977.209,Councilmember Sawant?,56,,
155,0.97,977.209,1008.54,"Thank you . As we discussed in the Council briefing this morning, signatures are circulating to police officer chief Diaz requesting they compile and release all of their records regarding the death of Herbert Hightower Junior was fatally shot by Seattle police in 2004 while experiencing a mental health crisis.",57,,
156,0.97,1008.54,1012.778,These public records were requested in August on behalf of the Hightower family and justice for Herbert Hightower Junior movement.,57,,
157,0.97,1012.778,1018.25,"We just heard from Castill Hightower, the sister of Herbert Hightower . We heard from community supporters.",57,,
158,0.97,1018.25,1029.028,"My office has had many conversations with Castill Hightower, who reported SPD responded with delay after delay.",57,,
159,0.97,1029.028,1042.841,"They first promised them September 21st and now November 30th, which we are at November 30th today and as of last night, she still had not received them.",57,,
160,0.97,1042.841,1051.55,"It is understandable that all records would require some time to recover from archives, but it is unacceptable to make this family wait months to release records about the deaths of their loved one.",57,,
161,0.97,1051.55,1063.962,"I agree with Castill Hightower . This is not only about the Hightower family, but about all of the families of others who have lost their lives at the hands of the police.",57,,
162,0.97,1063.962,1102.935,"I understand the police Department has argued they are unable to respond quicker than several months and while there may be some issues there, I find it incredible that a $350 million a year Department cannot provide public documents in a timely manner, especially in the context of the systematic issues we have seen that have been revealed by much of the process that happened in the wake of the John t Williams death many years ago, but also that have been highlighted nationwide in the George Floyd movement this year.",57,,
163,0.97,1102.935,1110.843,"As a matter of fact, I think we can safely say if we had had real police accountability, we would not be in this situation in the first place.",57,,
164,0.97,1110.843,1126.525,"As I mentioned this morning, the Hightower family is supported by more than 1850 community members, demanding the police release public records and I really look forward to all of the Councilmembers supporting and signing this matter.",57,,
