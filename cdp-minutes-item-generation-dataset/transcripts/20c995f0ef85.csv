66,0.97,452.652,453.986,He needs to hear it now.,12,,
67,0.97,453.986,454.62,He likes it.,12,,
68,0.97,454.62,455.354,[Laughter],12,,
69,0.97,455.354,466.899,"You and I don't know each other very well, Councilmember, but I grew up not far from the daybreak Star center and I spent a lot of time growing up there.",13,,
70,0.97,466.899,476.876,"And so the gang of four was important to me even though as a white man growing up in Ballard, white boy growing up in Ballard at that time it was very distant.",13,,
71,0.97,476.876,486.285,"So I actually have gang of four book here, and I keep it in my office because it reminds me of the interconnectedness between you and the other members.",13,,
72,0.97,486.285,496.395,"And I'll let others speak to this, but something I want to just point out is a, the Afro that Councilmember Juarez was talking about.",13,,
73,0.97,496.395,497.964,"When you signed this book, you signed it --",13,,
74,0.97,497.964,499.232,I already signed it for you.,14,,
75,0.97,499.232,501.3,You already signed it.,15,,
76,0.97,501.3,506.339,"When you signed this book, you signed it to the people of Seattle.",15,,
77,0.97,506.339,511.277,And that's very meaningful to me and that's why I keep it here in my office at City Hall.,15,,
78,0.97,511.277,519.819,"And so I just want to thank you for all your work, big shoes to fill.",15,,
79,0.97,519.819,521.587,I believe Councilmember Lewis.,16,,
80,0.97,521.587,525.725,"Thank you, Madam President pro Tem.",17,,
81,0.97,525.725,564.463,"So Councilmember, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize your commitment not just as a public servant but also as a mentor and a figure that's had such a big impact on the community, not just as an elected official but also as a private citizen and I have the great honor of having on my Council staff Camila Brown is in the audience who for 17 years worked for Councilmember Gossett.",17,,
82,0.97,564.463,571.504,And has just been an excellent member of my Council staff.,17,,
83,0.97,571.504,591.591,"She staffs public safety issues for me as well as other policy matters that come up and really appreciate--I think the mark, our impact is broader than just the policies or the resolutions that we vote on.",17,,
84,0.97,591.591,603.169,It's also how we are as mentors and how we are empowering our staff.,17,,
85,0.97,603.169,620.119,"The way she talks about you as a mentor, it's clear from years to come, from all the folks who went through your office as intern, as staff, that your legacy through the work of those folks you Mentored is going to be affecting this region for decades to come.",17,,
86,0.97,620.119,621.454,I'm so grateful for your service.,17,,
87,0.97,621.454,624.523,It's so great to see you here today to be recognized.,17,,
88,0.97,624.523,625.992,Thank you so much for everything you've done.,17,,
89,0.97,625.992,627.259,"Thank you, Councilmember.",18,,
90,0.97,627.259,628.427,[Applause],18,,
91,0.97,628.561,634.166,You know how to use that Mic.,19,,
92,0.97,634.166,637.136,Don't get shy now.,19,,
93,0.97,637.136,644.41,Thank you to the city council.,20,,
94,0.97,644.41,683.616,"I'm particularly impressed that somebody, one of you or your staff, besides identified four or five of us to represent the entire community as leaders, you also spent time in calling other community organizers, other community advocates, other African American community leaders in notifying them that this is taking place this afternoon, this special African American history recognition.",20,,
95,0.97,683.616,687.219,And that is unique.,20,,
96,0.97,687.219,693.426,"You pointed out, Teresa pointed out there are currently not any African Americans on the city council.",20,,
97,0.97,693.426,709.308,But the fact that you're conscious of that fact has been recognized in the manner of Úhaving this special African American salute today is really appreciated by all of us.,20,,
98,0.97,709.308,709.642,So thank you.,20,,
99,0.97,709.642,709.975,[Applause],20,,
100,0.97,710.109,724.49,"I just want to talk for one more, or one and a half more minutes about African American history as it relates to Seattle, Washington.",21,,
101,0.97,724.49,739.004,"Because I'm so proud of the work to make our entire community better, that the black community has played a leadership roll over years many years that I've had the pleasure of being here.",21,,
102,0.97,739.004,744.877,"I was born on February 21st, a couple days ago was my birthday.",21,,
103,0.97,744.877,746.679,1945 in King County hospital.,21,,
104,0.97,746.679,748.314,You all call it Harborview today.,21,,
105,0.97,748.314,754.887,So I am definitely a home boy.,21,,
106,0.97,754.887,755.554,I'm straight up.,21,,
107,0.97,755.554,779.612,So what I'm proud of is how we've been able to create this service orientation and this ability and willingness to push hard at working well with other communities of color and Progressive whites on many issues that all of us have in common.,21,,
108,0.97,779.612,795.261,"I remember that it was in 1999 that Eddie Wright, Jr. who's here with us today stood up at one of our annual Martin Luther King Salutes to his legacy that we always have in Seattle.",21,,
109,0.97,795.261,832.865,"As a matter of fact, from '83 to last January was the 38th year in a row that from the grassroots up, 10, 15, 20, 30 organizations always get together and build special Salutes to Dr. King's legacy that manifest themselves in workshops at Garfield, a huge rally, and always a March around two or three critical issues Impacting the black and other communities that are in need.",21,,
110,0.97,832.865,836.001,And no other community does that.,21,,
111,0.97,836.001,844.176,Because the Southern Christian leadership conference found out about the efforts we made to rename this county after Dr.,21,,
112,0.97,844.176,854.186,"King in 2009 invited me, I didn't even know but they invited me to a board meeting in Atlanta, Georgia.",21,,
113,0.97,854.186,885.884,"And of course I wore my King County pin because after all the people put pressure on me to lead the effort with them, along with them to get this county's namesake, because he was very articulate and other people that did the research, pointing out to us King was very racist, only vice president for Franklin Pierce for five weeks then he passed away.",21,,
114,0.97,885.884,886.485,He died.,21,,
115,0.97,886.485,893.592,"When he died, he had 169 slaves on his plantation in Georgia.",21,,
116,0.97,893.592,900.366,He had been a Senator from Georgia.,21,,
117,0.97,900.366,908.173,That's not a meaningful symbol for striving racial democracy that we in the greater Seattle area have been trying to fill.,21,,
118,0.97,908.173,915.714,"But anyway, when I walked into the meeting, usually people clap and give you accolades.",21,,
119,0.97,915.714,926.191,"I got about three or four steps inside the door, I don't know how they knew it was me, but they started clapping and the clapping lasted for several minutes.",21,,
120,0.97,926.191,928.927,And that wasn't for me as an individual black man.,21,,
121,0.97,928.927,940.839,"It was for me as the symbolic representative of Martin Luther King, Jr. County and how proud and the birthplace of Martin they were.",21,,
122,0.97,940.839,948.347,"And the fact that we put forth a movement that got that change, they thought it was masterful.",21,,
123,0.97,948.347,950.449,"It's not a street, it's an entire County.",21,,
124,0.97,950.449,955.087,Those are the kinds of things I think we should be proud of.,21,,
125,0.97,955.087,963.495,No other Community has had that kind of grassroots Salutes every year.,21,,
126,0.97,963.495,974.073,"When I was a youth, we organized the black student Union and black Panther party in Seattle, Washington.",21,,
127,0.97,974.073,984.883,"And after Bsu led the effort to have a sit-in in Franklin high school, March 29th, 1968, the city was in an uproar.",21,,
128,0.97,984.883,989.321,They said--they kept saying our Negroes don't act like this.,21,,
129,0.97,989.321,995.127,"Well, most of us was from Seattle.",21,,
130,0.97,995.127,996.528,Charles Carroll was a prosecuting attorney at that time.,21,,
131,0.97,996.528,1001.667,He said we've got to do something about getting these kind of people in jail.,21,,
132,0.97,1001.667,1002.768,And they arrested the leaders.,21,,
133,0.97,1002.768,1017.916,"But the only reason I'm telling you that, they arrested me, they thought I was going to kill the struggle and what it did, they put us in jail in the morning of April 4TH.",21,,
134,0.97,1017.916,1020.352,"On that very day, the synergy is really something here.",21,,
135,0.97,1020.352,1023.389,"On that very day Martin Luther King, Jr. was killed.",21,,
136,0.97,1023.389,1037.336,So we had the combination of the black community being very upset because young black students were advocating the two girls that got kicked out of Franklin for wearing their hair natural.,21,,
137,0.97,1037.336,1045.844,Then the principal sent a note home saying your daughter can no longer attend Franklin high school until she looked lady -Like.,21,,
138,0.97,1045.844,1046.278,That was outrageous.,21,,
139,0.97,1046.278,1050.716,"So the entire black student population there, we had the first sit-in.",21,,
140,0.97,1050.716,1070.169,"The important thing I want to say about the black community though is that that next morning, more black people entered the King County courthouse on that morning than had ever entered the King County courthouse before or since.",21,,
141,0.97,1070.169,1075.541,"For our Arraignment, we had 1585 people.",21,,
142,0.97,1075.541,1079.645,Because we had some Bsu Brothers.,21,,
143,0.97,1079.645,1080.212,Counting everybody there.,21,,
144,0.97,1080.212,1080.879,1500 black.,21,,
145,0.97,1080.879,1092.124,"And 68 of the black population, about 31,000, so that's a pretty good percentage all down here.",21,,
146,0.97,1092.124,1099.765,"I ran eight times, Bruce knows this, I ran eight times for King County Council.",21,,
147,0.97,1099.765,1110.142,"And every time, because the county runs analysis of the voting, every time I got 92% of the vote, even this ninth time when I lost.",21,,
148,0.97,1110.142,1112.711,I got 92% of the African American vote.,21,,
149,0.97,1112.711,1122.154,So nobody can ever tell me that Seattle blacks don't stick together when it's necessary and benefits our community.,21,,
150,0.97,1122.154,1126.358,Thank you very much.,21,,
151,0.97,1126.358,1130.829,[cheers and Applause],21,,
152,0.97,1130.829,1136.235,"Thank you, Councilmember Gossett.",22,,
153,0.97,1136.235,1140.239,Can we have Reverend Walden?,22,,
154,0.97,1140.239,1147.279,"Before we begin, Reverend, I want to say a quick few words.",22,,
155,0.97,1147.279,1155.921,"Again, as we said, you've been an inspiration, not only in your work with the community police Commission, but social justice, equality, civil rights.",22,,
156,0.97,1155.921,1158.59,You've been a leader and an inspiration for many of us.,22,,
157,0.97,1158.59,1161.793,And it's always a pleasure and an honor to be in your presence.,22,,
158,0.97,1161.793,1166.832,Thank you so much.,23,,
159,0.97,1166.832,1167.132,Thank you.,23,,
160,0.97,1167.132,1176.108,"I just wanted to thank you for this opportunity, acknowledging African American black history.",23,,
161,0.97,1176.108,1178.11,It's been 157 years since Lincoln signed the paper.,23,,
162,0.97,1178.11,1183.615,That's how long this has taken to get here.,23,,
163,0.97,1183.615,1185.484,"History, change in a system takes a long time.",23,,
164,0.97,1185.484,1193.692,One of the things we've done and continued to do is to stay at the table.,23,,
165,0.97,1193.692,1197.93,"Through all this UPS and downs, we never take our marbles and go home.",23,,
166,0.97,1197.93,1198.53,We stay at the table.,23,,
167,0.97,1198.53,1203.936,"I stay at the table not only for myself, for my ancestors who didn't have this table to sit at.",23,,
168,0.97,1203.936,1211.577,"For all the young people who know that sometimes we want it right now, but it doesn't always happen right now.",23,,
169,0.97,1211.577,1215.614,Really the measure of it is that you stay.,23,,
170,0.97,1215.614,1219.084,"And I stay, I won't stay till I'm 99.",23,,
171,0.97,1219.084,1219.718,I guarantee you that.,23,,
172,0.97,1219.718,1229.962,Some people say you need to go home.,23,,
173,0.97,1229.962,1230.262,It's okay.,23,,
174,0.97,1230.262,1231.23,But I love Seattle.,23,,
175,0.97,1231.23,1231.663,I love Garfield.,23,,
176,0.97,1231.663,1235.867,I know there's always some dogs in the house.,23,,
177,0.97,1235.867,1240.505,I grew up in Florida but I'm an honorary Bulldog.,23,,
178,0.97,1240.505,1241.573,I love Garfield.,23,,
179,0.97,1241.573,1242.808,And I love Seattle.,23,,
180,0.97,1242.808,1251.75,And I thank you for recognizing me and also for all the other people who actually do good work every day all over America.,23,,
181,0.97,1251.75,1252.918,People wake up doing good.,23,,
182,0.97,1252.918,1254.252,They don't make the news.,23,,
183,0.97,1254.252,1257.022,They don't get paid for it.,23,,
184,0.97,1257.022,1258.79,They're serving children.,23,,
185,0.97,1258.79,1260.325,They're working with homeless people.,23,,
186,0.97,1260.325,1260.792,People without homes.,23,,
187,0.97,1260.792,1264.763,They're working with mothers who have been abused.,23,,
188,0.97,1264.763,1272.204,Every day there's millions of people who volunteer in America because they love their community.,23,,
189,0.97,1272.204,1274.606,"And my Seattle is not dying, all right?",23,,
190,0.97,1274.606,1274.973,Thank you.,24,,
191,0.97,1274.973,1275.273,[Applause],24,,
192,0.97,1275.407,1292.624,"Next we'd like to honor and call up our community leader, Ms. Mary flowers.",25,,
193,0.97,1292.624,1296.228,Got a fan Club back there.,25,,
194,0.97,1296.228,1296.928,Good afternoon.,26,,
195,0.97,1296.928,1300.198,"I came here for them, for Larry Gossett.",26,,
196,0.97,1300.198,1300.966,I came for him.,26,,
197,0.97,1300.966,1303.135,I didn't know this was happening.,26,,
198,0.97,1303.135,1304.002,I'm not really prepared.,26,,
199,0.97,1304.002,1307.339,I guess you always have to be ready.,26,,
200,0.97,1307.339,1312.244,"As we talk about black history month, my father was born here in 1910.",26,,
201,0.97,1312.244,1317.215,"He knew, and so as we talk about that, we heard the history every day at the dinner table.",26,,
202,0.97,1317.215,1325.557,The current history too about how people were dealt with during the course of that day and every day there was a different story about how they had to deal with racism.,26,,
203,0.97,1325.557,1332.931,"And my father was coming up, as I was coming up, and as my children are still coming up right now.",26,,
204,0.97,1332.931,1333.432,So nothing has changed.,26,,
205,0.97,1333.432,1336.568,"As Reverend Walden said, we try to stay at the table.",26,,
206,0.97,1336.568,1340.872,What we need to be real clear about is we already bought the table and we own the table.,26,,
207,0.97,1340.872,1342.474,And we have to come in that way.,26,,
208,0.97,1342.474,1344.81,So I work for the city of Seattle.,26,,
209,0.97,1344.81,1346.445,I work in homelessness.,26,,
210,0.97,1346.445,1354.886,"We are in the midst of reorganizing, and I hope it's not just reorganizing chairs.",26,,
211,0.97,1354.886,1357.723,But I hope we're really real about what's going on.,26,,
212,0.97,1357.723,1361.893,Seattle may not be dying but our people are dying.,26,,
213,0.97,1361.893,1362.728,Our people are dying.,26,,
214,0.97,1362.728,1365.497,Today I was advocating for a person who was born on Dr.,26,,
215,0.97,1365.497,1365.997,King's birthday.,26,,
216,0.97,1365.997,1370.869,"I remember when he was 10 years old, what our expectations were for him.",26,,
217,0.97,1370.869,1377.008,"And now he has been through--not been through, fallen through every single system that we have.",26,,
218,0.97,1377.008,1385.584,"I have to leave here and go back and advocate for him in a way that's so Hurtful, so Hurtful and harmful because our systems are so broken.",26,,
219,0.97,1385.584,1386.551,They don't work together.,26,,
220,0.97,1386.551,1390.522,And I have to advocate it for him in a way that's going to be really harmful.,26,,
221,0.97,1390.522,1391.089,There's no win for him.,26,,
222,0.97,1391.089,1396.928,He's in his 40s and we've got children four years old still going through this process.,26,,
223,0.97,1396.928,1403.668,We talk about a race and social justice initiative which really has now been turned into something that really maintains the system.,26,,
224,0.97,1403.668,1416.081,"And I hope that it does not take those of you, there were Council people that just left and I can remember when we were going through a campaign, I sat down with them.",26,,
225,0.97,1416.081,1417.949,They had an epiphany.,26,,
226,0.97,1417.949,1420.218,"And I'm thinking, my God, you're on your way out.",26,,
227,0.97,1420.218,1423.555,I'm hoping you can have your epiphany now.,26,,
228,0.97,1423.555,1427.659,Because it's not just having that book with the four Amigos.,26,,
229,0.97,1427.659,1429.561,It's not about that.,26,,
230,0.97,1429.561,1432.964,It's really understanding what it took then.,26,,
231,0.97,1432.964,1433.331,That's history.,26,,
232,0.97,1433.331,1437.369,But what's even more complex now because everybody has the words for it.,26,,
233,0.97,1437.369,1449.781,And we have created more skillful racists now who can use the language of equity and step on our feet and step on our head.,26,,
234,0.97,1449.781,1450.248,That's more harmful.,26,,
235,0.97,1450.248,1460.926,"I hope all you Council people really get serious about going to community, being in community, taking your leadership from community and not using lip service when you talk about race and social justice.",26,,
236,0.97,1460.926,1465.497,I'm grateful for this but we have to speak the truth.,26,,
237,0.97,1465.497,1466.765,Thank you.,27,,
238,0.97,1466.765,1467.065,[Applause],27,,
239,0.97,1467.199,1484.449,"It's a great honor and pleasure to introduce and ask that we have our former Council President, Mr. Harrell.",28,,
240,0.97,1484.449,1484.749,[Applause],28,,
241,0.97,1484.883,1489.888,"Thank you very much, Council President.",29,,
242,0.97,1489.888,1493.058,"And thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda, for scheduling this.",29,,
243,0.97,1493.058,1496.428,"Mary flowers, you said you came here to see me.",29,,
244,0.97,1496.428,1497.062,You didn't acknowledge it.,29,,
245,0.97,1497.062,1504.536,You said you came to see Larry.,29,,
246,0.97,1504.536,1506.238,[Laughter] okay.,29,,
247,0.97,1506.238,1511.243,"In all seriousness, thank you.",29,,

249,0.97,1516.448,1517.048,Thank you very much.,29,,
250,0.97,1517.048,1520.118,Most of our roots have come from somewhere down South.,29,,
251,0.97,1520.118,1523.822,"Mine hail from Louisiana, part of the great migration.",29,,
252,0.97,1523.822,1531.696,"And the community has historically, if you read Isabel Wilkerson's book, historically gone where there are jobs and opportunity.",29,,
253,0.97,1531.696,1532.297,A thirst for justice.,29,,
254,0.97,1532.297,1537.435,And I think you've heard from our great speakers about certainly it's not over.,29,,
255,0.97,1537.435,1544.175,And largely due to the people standing behind me and I apologize for my back being to you.,29,,
256,0.97,1544.175,1552.617,I have my Fraternal Brothers from the Alpha Phi community.,29,,
257,0.97,1552.617,1559.09,I have my business partner Godwin Gabriel here in case you wanted to know what I'm doing now.,29,,
258,0.97,1559.09,1560.191,He's technically my boss actually.,29,,
259,0.97,1560.191,1562.527,Although I'm more like a big brother to him.,29,,
260,0.97,1562.527,1568.667,"My wife could not be here, I know that because I took her to the airport at 4:00 A.M.",29,,
261,0.97,1568.667,1569.868,So I'm a little punch drunk.,29,,
262,0.97,1569.868,1573.405,But I'll tell you that our community is vibrant and strong.,29,,
263,0.97,1573.405,1580.645,"And we have been motivated not by hatred but by love, love for our community, our faith.",29,,
264,0.97,1580.645,1580.946,Our faith.,29,,
265,0.97,1580.946,1584.849,Seattle is in a unique position to be a world leader.,29,,
266,0.97,1584.849,1590.989,"And all of you, congratulations to the new Councilmembers.",29,,
267,0.97,1590.989,1592.023,You're doing a marvelous job.,29,,
268,0.97,1592.023,1594.526,You're probably not told that enough.,29,,
269,0.97,1594.526,1595.86,I will tell you that.,29,,
270,0.97,1595.86,1597.562,Because I wasn't told that enough.,29,,
271,0.97,1597.562,1601.232,Because you're simply trying to come up with the best ideas.,29,,
272,0.97,1601.232,1604.502,You don't have to be Denigrated when you're coming up with ideas.,29,,
273,0.97,1604.502,1609.941,And people may not agree with all of your ideas but that is what they are.,29,,
274,0.97,1609.941,1611.076,Ideas to improve our lives.,29,,
275,0.97,1611.076,1616.381,"So again, the African American community is strong, vibrant, unique, powerful.",29,,
276,0.97,1616.381,1624.522,"And just because there's not an African American on that side of the Diosce, and there will be again.",29,,
277,0.97,1624.522,1626.257,I'm going to make sure of that.,29,,
278,0.97,1626.257,1628.159,There will be.,29,,
279,0.97,1628.159,1634.332,But I know you understand what diversity and inclusiveness is all about.,29,,
280,0.97,1634.332,1635.066,You're demonstrating it today.,29,,
281,0.97,1635.066,1639.971,Thank you for letting me receive an interesting proclamation.,29,,
282,0.97,1639.971,1643.842,We're just receiving it on behalf of our community.,29,,
283,0.97,1643.842,1644.676,It's not about us.,29,,
284,0.97,1644.676,1648.38,We're just playing a very small role.,29,,
285,0.97,1648.38,1652.183,"Councilmember Morales, I know unity day is coming up Friday.",29,,
286,0.97,1652.183,1653.785,Thanks for your leadership there.,29,,
287,0.97,1653.785,1662.06,"I humbly take this in the spirit in which you've given it to us, our community, love for our community that's so sacred to us.",29,,
288,0.97,1662.06,1665.33,Thank you very much.,29,,
289,0.97,1665.33,1671.202,"Thank you, Council President Harrell.",30,,
290,0.97,1671.336,1674.639,"Councilmember Mosqueda, do you want to do some closing remarks?",30,,
291,0.97,1674.639,1674.873,Sure.,31,,
292,0.97,1674.873,1675.907,Thank you Madam President.,31,,
293,0.97,1675.907,1677.809,Thank you all for being here.,31,,
294,0.97,1677.809,1690.989,"I wonder if before we leave this agenda topic, Madam President, if we might want to do a group photo that way so that the entire room that is represented in terms of receiving the proclamation can be documented as well for this historic day.",31,,
295,0.97,1690.989,1695.693,I think that you all have said it more eloquently than anybody can.,31,,
296,0.97,1695.693,1699.764,This is not about just looking in the Rearview mirror in terms of history.,31,,
297,0.97,1699.764,1720.719,"This is about thinking with the action and motivation and strategies are now and into the future for Actualizing what we are here to do and that is to live out the Declaration of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s proclamations, to live out Malcolm X's call for equity in the truest sense, to make sure as Ms. flowers said, that we're not just providing lip service.",31,,
298,0.97,1720.719,1741.906,"So what you all have called on us to do is to hold us accountable in the future, to make sure we're not only held accountable but that we're truly working in community and not taking these positions without recognizing that it is you all who need to give us direction, not us who are just up here coming up with ideas.",31,,
299,0.97,1741.906,1747.979,"The ideas for true equity, inclusion, and justice are coming from the communities.",31,,
300,0.97,1747.979,1749.781,We're all here to make that possible.,31,,
301,0.97,1749.781,1758.69,Today recognizes the work of the black community in terms of history but let's make sure that that history that we're building on that history and creating opportunities for greater equity in the future.,31,,
302,0.97,1758.69,1761.326,So thank you all of you for being here.,31,,
303,0.97,1761.326,1761.693,You inspire me.,31,,
304,0.97,1761.693,1762.894,I think you motivate us all.,31,,
305,0.97,1762.894,1766.765,And we know we're going to be held to accountability.,31,,
306,0.97,1766.765,1767.532,Thanks so much for being here.,31,,
307,0.97,1767.532,1774.172,Thanks to my staff in the back as well who really thought we needed to make sure we brought this proclamation forward this month.,31,,
308,0.97,1774.172,1778.71,A huge amount of appreciation for them and for all of you.,31,,
309,0.97,1778.71,1779.01,[Applause],31,,
310,0.97,1779.144,1788.453,"Before we close out, I want to say something briefly.",32,,
311,0.97,1788.453,1801.099,"First of all, to Councilmember Harrell, thank you for those words about when people come into chambers, a lot of times you hear them say I want to recognize that we're on indigenous land.",32,,
312,0.97,1801.099,1810.575,"And what drives me crazy is growing up when we say that when we walk in a room, then you don't turn around and start calling people names.",32,,
313,0.97,1810.575,1811.876,It's about behavior.,32,,
314,0.97,1811.876,1812.41,It's about respect.,32,,
315,0.97,1812.41,1817.182,"It's about a safe place, a sacred place to have a voice even if we disagree.",32,,
316,0.97,1817.182,1823.688,"I want to thank you, Councilmember Harrell, for coming in my office and providing me that perspective of calm down, little sister.",32,,
317,0.97,1823.688,1823.955,Calm down.,32,,
318,0.97,1823.955,1827.358,I want to thank you for that leadership.,32,,
319,0.97,1827.358,1830.328,I also want to thank Mary flowers for what you said.,32,,
320,0.97,1830.328,1839.47,"She said something I've been hearing my whole life particularly from my Uncle Billy Frank, when people chant we want it, we want it now, the world doesn't work like that.",32,,
321,0.97,1839.47,1844.943,"There are people paid for the things we had, not just with a T-shirt and a hat and a sign.",32,,
322,0.97,1844.943,1845.877,Our people died for it.,32,,
323,0.97,1845.877,1848.546,"Our people lost their lives, their dignity.",32,,
324,0.97,1848.546,1850.648,There are laws passed against our people.,32,,
325,0.97,1850.648,1852.984,How did we get here today?,32,,
326,0.97,1852.984,1859.924,We didn't show up with Undeserveed confidence and undeserved privilege to say I want it.,32,,
327,0.97,1859.924,1861.359,Now it's in my front yard.,32,,
328,0.97,1861.359,1862.493,That's what I struggle with.,32,,
329,0.97,1862.493,1866.598,I want to thank you for those very more than inspirational words.,32,,
330,0.97,1866.598,1871.135,"I'm going to carry them with me, my heart and soul.",32,,
331,0.97,1871.135,1876.207,"As we say in Indian country, my hands are up to you.",32,,
332,0.97,1876.207,1877.041,I thank you.,32,,
333,0.97,1877.041,1880.211,Want to do one more picture?,32,,
334,0.97,1880.211,1888.82,Let's do that.,32,,
335,0.97,1967.498,1970.601,Everyone look at me.,33,,
336,0.97,1970.601,1977.275,"1, 2, 3. one more.",33,,
337,0.97,1977.575,1978.142,One more.,33,,
338,0.97,1988.286,1988.486,Thank you all.,33,,

377,0.97,2237.068,2275.84,"When I have to come all the way to King County to speak about false documents for which my law enforcement sit up there and put forward for African Americans to be tried falsely as we were done back in the '60s and the '50S and through the '70s, to still be going on today through the Everett police Department in Snohomish County and for me to have to come to King County to speak with you about it in order to get something done is sad still to this day, in this day and age.",37,,
378,0.97,2275.84,2299.53,"I really don't know what to say about it except for speaking with chief Daniel Templeton and Mayor Franklin, to find out there's not one African American who sits in the Everett police Department, who sits on the city council in Snohomish county or on the county Council for that matter is sad, you know, today.",37,,
379,0.97,2299.53,2299.93,It's really sad.,37,,
380,0.97,2299.93,2314.979,"And again, I want to say thank you to that King County Metro bus driver who spoke words of encouragement to me, this African American man who took the time out to give me the courage to speak here today.",37,,

388,0.97,2356.32,2366.864,It seems that global warming is actually occurring and we can keep pretending that it's not occurring.,39,,
389,0.97,2366.864,2382.38,"However, this will require confronting uncomfortable schema within our society such as right now money, if you have money, you're seemingly safe and if you don't have money, you're not safe.",39,,
390,0.97,2382.38,2384.081,And that only begins with humans.,39,,

392,0.97,2393.29,2417.214,"So people with a lot of money can waste a lot of money and a lot of resources, and I think it's good to address the housing crisis by fair distribution of wealth and so I'm really disappointed in the vote last week about not allowing the city to tax big, big business.",39,,
393,0.97,2417.214,2427.591,And I'll be really disappointed if the state in the preemptive clause ADOPTS that way of thinking.,39,,
394,0.97,2427.591,2438.235,"If we say we're a green state and we're pro environment and we advertise that, then we need to actually think about how money impacts the environment.",39,,
395,0.97,2438.235,2446.51,"The way it's going right now, the system of money is seriously extracting coal and tar.",39,,
396,0.97,2446.51,2449.046,We had protests on third Avenue.,39,,
397,0.97,2449.046,2456.287,"And those things, we're injecting more coal and Tar than Lke 60 Hiroshima bombs.",39,,
398,0.97,2456.287,2457.021,Or maybe it's 600.,39,,
399,0.97,2457.021,2462.726,We have enough carbon if it's a 25 meter to go all the way up to the moon of graphite.,39,,
400,0.97,2462.726,2468.532,So it's pretty serious.,39,,

444,0.97,2658.856,2667.131,This is a list of 17 large discreet projects that will be subject to in-depth quarterly reporting this year.,51,,
445,0.97,2667.131,2679.009,This was established by ordinance in 2018 after several projects had significant overruns and delays without the Council or the public's knowledge or involvement.,51,,

450,0.97,2713.911,2737.968,"If there's ill defined operations costs, or other funding plans, we'll be able to have clear heads up on that and be able to have the legislative branch weigh in on our perceived priorities and identify significant questions and ask questions about scope, schedule, and budget so that we can ensure that the public's dollar is being well accounted for and that we are on track to fulfilling the Council's desired outcomes for these projects.",51,,

454,0.97,2749.146,2762.693,I just want to flag that one of the things we talked about in committee was a recognition that the intent of the resolution was for the Finance Committee to be the designated committee to hear the reports overall.,53,,
455,0.97,2762.693,2798.228,"But there was a hope that individual committees that have responsibility for capital improvement projects that are on the watch list, that those individual communities do a deeper dive on monitoring projects that are in the watch list and consider spending Lim Itations where appropriate as yet another way to enhance oversight, perhaps by using stage Gating or budget Provisos to have additional oversight on those projects, and thanks to chair Mosqueda.",53,,
456,0.97,2798.228,2817.247,"I appreciate that she has indicated that she also has interest in figuring out a way, whether or not we can as a Council, identify checks and balances on our ways to make sure that enhanced oversight is happening.",53,,

458,0.97,2819.516,2821.952,We can't totally rely on our central staff.,53,,
459,0.97,2821.952,2832.863,I think we have to also think creatively about ways that we can do our part in monitoring some of these projects.,53,,
