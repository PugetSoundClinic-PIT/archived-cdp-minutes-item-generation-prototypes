36,0.97,111.177,136.102,"At this time, we will go ahead and open up the remote public comment period for items on the city council agenda introduction and referral calendar and the Council's 2020 work program.",20,,
37,0.97,141.508,148.481,-- and things that are part of our 2020 work program.,20,,
38,0.97,148.481,160.627,We are continuously looking for ways to fine tune this process and adding new features that will allow us and the public for full participation in our Council meetings through remote public comment period.,20,,
39,0.97,160.627,184.284,"Again, it remains the strong intent of the city Council to have public comment regularly included on our meeting Agendas, however, the city council reserves the right to end these public comment periods if we deem the system is being abused or is no longer suitable to conduct our meetings efficiently.",20,,
40,0.97,184.284,188.821,I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner.,20,,
41,0.97,188.821,191.391,The public comment period will be 60 minutes.,20,,
42,0.97,191.391,200.967,"Normally it is only 20 minutes, but we continue to have a strong interest from members of the public in Testifying.",20,,
43,0.97,200.967,209.776,"Today's list, as of a few moments ago, had 116 people signed up to provide us with public comment.",20,,
44,0.97,209.776,215.315,Last week I believe we had 160 and the prior week we were also in the hundreds.,20,,

47,0.97,223.556,234.534,"So it's--it is definitely a tool that the public is taking advantage of and we appreciate Tha, but it does put limitations on how many people we can accept public comment from in this session.",20,,
48,0.97,234.534,240.673,"So again, we'll have a public comment period that will last exactly 60 minutes.",20,,
49,0.97,240.673,248.448,"Each Speaker will be given one minute, that's 60 seconds, to provide us with public comment.",20,,
50,0.97,248.448,252.885,That is for purposes of making sure we can hear from as many people as possible.,20,,
51,0.97,252.885,267.767,"Normally we have two minutes, but Unfortunately, with this many folks, and again, I think Councilmembers have strong interest in hearing from as many people as possible, we're going to reduce that time to one minute for each Speaker to provide us with their public testimony.",20,,
52,0.97,267.767,274.574,I will call on each Speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the Council's Website.,20,,

56,0.97,298.398,321.688,"Again, folks, for those of you giving public comment, please be aware that we do do closed Captioning and in order to get accurate transcription, we ask you Modulate your speech so the software is able to pick up on what you're saying so that hearing impaired folks who are viewing today are able to get an accurate reflection of what your public comment is.",20,,
57,0.97,321.688,334.133,"Again, please begin by stating your name, the item you are addressing, and as a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on the agenda, the calendar or the 2020 work program.",20,,

61,0.97,350.083,364.864,"Once you've completed your public comment, please Disconnect from the line and if you want to follow this meeting, you can do so via Seattlechannel.Org or on Seattle channel 21, or any one of the listening options listed on the Prepublish agenda.",20,,

63,0.97,376.109,384.417,We're going to try to get to as many folks as we can out of the at least 116 folks that have signed up.,20,,
64,0.97,384.417,393.292,Your public comment is still important to us and public comment period isn't the only way you can get your public comment and opinion to us.,20,,
65,0.97,393.292,412.879,"You can also Email us at Council @ Seattle.Gov or you can call any one of us or submit your public comment to us via any one of our social media channels, either individually or as a collective.",20,,

832,0.97,4869.297,4883.778,"This substitute version LOWERS the initial price that Councilmember Herbold and I had considered in terms of the premium pay number, which originally was $5 per delivery.",182,,
833,0.97,4883.778,4916.111,"Having consulted with our labor partners as well as the platform in the space, we determined that a $2.50 per delivery still accomplished the goals of the premium pay in terms of compensating for time spent cleaning vehicles and acquiring Ppe and Sanitizer as well as also making sure there was some consideration for the unique hazards that folks are facing during Covid.",182,,
834,0.97,4916.111,4919.214,"So for that reason, we made some of these changes.",182,,
835,0.97,4919.214,4921.883,There are substantive changes in the bill.,182,,
836,0.97,4921.883,4946.641,There are also some technical changes that do not otherwise make considerable changes a--there's going to be other amendments addressing the fact that this substitute does not have a provision like some other versions of the bill had had where the cost could potentially be partially passed through to consumers.,182,,
837,0.97,4946.641,4968.33,"So this substitute bill would allow folks to partially pass through some or all of the additional cost to consumers, and that's a discussion that we can have, I believe Councilmember Morales will be bringing forward an amendment to bring up that conversation.",182,,
838,0.97,4968.33,4969.597,"But otherwise, there's substantive changes.",182,,
839,0.97,4969.597,4977.839,I don't know if Councilmember Herbold has anything to add to that before we move forward on a vote to adopt the substitute.,182,,
840,0.97,4977.839,4982.944,"Councilmember Herbold, anything to add on the motion to consider the substitute?",183,,
841,0.97,4982.944,4983.378,No.,184,,
842,0.97,4983.378,4985.613,I think Councilmember Lewis handled it well.,184,,
843,0.97,4985.613,4989.417,I have nothing further to add.,184,,
844,0.97,4989.417,4990.151,Great.,185,,
845,0.97,4990.151,4990.685,Thank you so much.,185,,
846,0.97,4990.685,5000.528,"Colleagues, any questions on the substitute version being proposed for consideration?",185,,
847,0.97,5000.528,5000.996,Councilmember Sawant?,185,,
848,0.97,5000.996,5001.663,Thank you.,186,,
849,0.97,5001.663,5020.148,Needless to say that I support the legislation itself to require additional hazard pay to gig workers who sacrifice--self-sacrifice and labor is really one of the only things that has allowed many people to continue to have access to food and mobility during this Covid crisis.,186,,
850,0.97,5020.148,5038.133,And these workers are doing so at great personal risk of infection and often with very little compensation from the multinational corporations that hire them which have even been extremely sting Ji in giving them very basic protective equipment as well.,186,,
851,0.97,5038.133,5049.177,"However, what we are discussing now in this motion to place an amended version of the original bill is whether to substitute a new draft of the bill for the original.",186,,
852,0.97,5049.177,5059.988,And I wanted to say that I strongly prefer the original bill to this substitution because the original bill is significantly stronger in many respects.,186,,
853,0.97,5059.988,5068.63,"First, the original bill protects both food delivery, gig workers and drivers like those who drive for Uber and Lyft.",186,,
854,0.97,5068.63,5072.167,"The substitute, however, only protects food delivery workers.",186,,
855,0.97,5072.167,5077.939,"And I will, of course, be opposing any amendment that excludes any workers from these protections.",186,,
856,0.97,5077.939,5090.785,"I understand that some Councilmembers are arguing that this change is reasonable because they believe the Mayor will draft legislation in the future to cover drivers, but that reason is totally insufficient.",186,,
857,0.97,5090.785,5096.891,This is emergency legislation that already only requires hazard pay during the legally declared emergency.,186,,
858,0.97,5096.891,5098.46,That ends when the emergency ends.,186,,
859,0.97,5098.46,5101.83,"If the--so again, we're talking about the bare minimum.",186,,
860,0.97,5101.83,5116.711,"If the Mayor does generate this legislation in time to go into effect on October 1st, which teamsters have told my office is the current schedule, it's very possible that these hazard pay restrictions would have expired by then anyway.",186,,
861,0.97,5116.711,5123.518,"So that would leave drivers with having had no hazard pay protections through the entire public health emergency, the official emergency.",186,,
862,0.97,5123.518,5133.328,"Even if the official Cove Vitd emergency is not legally expired, this amendment would still leave drivers without hazard pay for three and a half months.",186,,
863,0.97,5133.328,5136.331,"Additionally, that's based on the Timeline before.",186,,
864,0.97,5136.331,5144.139,There's no guarantee that even that Timeline will be adhered to.,186,,
865,0.97,5144.139,5149.41,"Additionally, the bill Majorly reduces the hazard pay fit.",186,,
866,0.97,5149.41,5155.783,"The original bill provided $5 hazard pay for delivery, plus $5 for each additional stop.",186,,
867,0.97,5155.783,5164.526,This substitute cuts that more than in half to $2.50 for delivery and only $1.25 for additional stops.,186,,
868,0.97,5164.526,5181.242,"We should also remember that this legislation is in response to nationwide--the base legislation is in response to nationwide organizing of gig workers, including a courageous strike called by Instacart workers calling for $5 delivery premium pay.",186,,
869,0.97,5181.242,5184.078,Who is demanding it to be reduced?,186,,
870,0.97,5184.078,5191.119,"I can only guess the big delivery businesses have been putting pressure in the back rooms, because we have not seen that in public comment.",186,,
871,0.97,5191.119,5198.693,Gig workers are many of the essential workers who have made it possible for Seattleites to have food and be mobile during this public health crisis.,186,,
872,0.97,5198.693,5211.472,And they have done so at great personal risk with extremely low wages while their multinational bosses have profited throughout the pandemic.,186,,
873,0.97,5211.472,5218.913,I do not support this amendment that would exclude drivers so I will be voting no on this substitution.,186,,
874,0.97,5218.913,5225.753,I will be voting yes on the overall bill when we do that later.,186,,
875,0.97,5225.753,5228.623,"Okay, thank you so much, Councilmember Sawant.",187,,
876,0.97,5228.623,5233.761,"Councilmember Herbold has raised her hand, so I'm going to recognize Councilmember Herbold.",187,,
877,0.97,5233.761,5234.095,Thank you.,188,,
878,0.97,5234.095,5252.614,"I just want to note that as it relates to removing TNC drivers from the bill in the substitute that Councilmember Lewis just spoke to, that was a request from the teamsters.",188,,
879,0.97,5252.614,5261.389,They requested that we remove the authorization of the hazard pay for their drivers.,188,,
880,0.97,5261.389,5291.119,"And then as it relates specifically to the different price point that was negotiated with working Washington, they recognize that there is a balance that is necessary to strike and they do not want to see a reduction in use of the food delivery services in response to a price point that is too high.",188,,
881,0.97,5291.119,5322.85,"And so that is Reall Foundational thinking around, again, trying to hit that sweet spot between what the price point should be to compensate drivers for the time it takes to maintain the vehicles in a way that's consistent with public held standards and the products necessary to do so.",188,,
882,0.97,5322.85,5330.158,"And also recognizing that this is working during this period of time is, indeed, a hazard.",188,,
883,0.97,5330.158,5341.235,"So again, really appreciate having the opportunity to work with working Washington throughout this process and leading up to the substitution.",188,,
884,0.97,5341.235,5346.307,"Thank you for that additional information, Councilmember Herbold.",189,,
885,0.97,5346.307,5351.546,Any other comments or questions on the substitute bill?,189,,
886,0.97,5351.546,5362.056,"Okay, hearing and seeing none, I think we are ready to consider the substitute version unless Councilmember Lewis, do you have anything else to add?",189,,
887,0.97,5362.056,5364.092,"I do not, Madame President.",190,,
888,0.97,5364.092,5364.759,"Okay, great.",191,,
889,0.97,5364.759,5375.336,Let's go ahead and I will have the clerk call the roll on the adoption of the substitute.,191,,

909,0.97,5400.461,5401.996,Thank you so much.,211,,
910,0.97,5401.996,5406.334,The substitute is adopted and version four of the bill is now before the Council.,211,,
911,0.97,5406.334,5414.542,So I will go ahead and now open up the floor for additional debate and comments on the bill as amended.,211,,
912,0.97,5414.542,5416.444,"Colleagues, are there any other amendments?",211,,
913,0.97,5416.444,5427.188,"I know Councilmember Morales, you have a particular amendment, so perhaps what we should do is consider your amendment first and then we can have a conversation on the bill as amended.",211,,
914,0.97,5427.188,5427.955,How does that sound?,211,,
915,0.97,5427.955,5428.456,Sure.,212,,
916,0.97,5428.456,5429.157,"Okay, great.",213,,
917,0.97,5429.157,5436.063,"I'll hand it to you, Councilmember Morales, to make your motion to put amendment one before the Council.",213,,
918,0.97,5436.063,5445.54,So I move that we amend Council bill 119799 as presented on item one on the agenda.,214,,
919,0.97,5445.54,5445.84,Great.,215,,
920,0.97,5445.84,5446.707,Is there a second?,215,,
921,0.97,5446.707,5446.974,Second.,216,,
922,0.97,5446.974,5457.518,"It's been moved and Seconded to amend the bill, and I will hand it over to Councilmember Morales so describe amendment one.",217,,
923,0.97,5457.518,5460.454,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez.",218,,
924,0.97,5460.454,5467.395,"So this amendment would prohibit the hiring entity from passing on charges, increasing grocery charges to consumers.",218,,
925,0.97,5467.395,5480.141,We all know that the economic impact of Covid are having really drastic effects on our families and food security in particular was a problem in the city already.,218,,
926,0.97,5480.141,5487.348,"And we know that food insecurity is increasing, especially during this crisis.",218,,
927,0.97,5487.348,5498.392,So this is really an attempt to decrease the risk of having customers who are relying on grocery delivery from having that charge passed on to them.,218,,
928,0.97,5498.392,5520.781,"We want to make sure that we are protecting our vulnerable neighbors, our seniors especially, families with children and anybody who is really at risk of food insecurity so that they are--so that this assessment or this charge does not get passed on to them.",218,,
929,0.97,5520.781,5522.984,And that's what we're doing here.,218,,
930,0.97,5522.984,5523.251,Great.,219,,
931,0.97,5523.251,5529.624,"Thank you so much for that description, Councilmember Morales.",219,,

956,0.97,5590.351,5591.953,Councilmember Mosqueda followed by Councilmember Lewis.,238,,
957,0.97,5591.953,5594.455,"Thank you so much, Madame President.",239,,
958,0.97,5594.455,5600.261,"And thanks to the sponsors of this legislation, Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Lewis.",239,,
959,0.97,5600.261,5604.865,Really exciting day for gig workers and actually just for our entire economy.,239,,
960,0.97,5604.865,5618.813,"As we know, gig workers have been left out of the basic protections that we have been so proud of here in Washington State and in the city of Seattle to offer to, With2 employees.",239,,
961,0.97,5618.813,5625.686,"But basic labor standards are hard to legislate, especially for gig workers as the sponsors and this entire Council know.",239,,
962,0.97,5625.686,5628.522,I'm excited about the piece of legislation in front of us.,239,,
963,0.97,5628.522,5632.693,I think there's much more work to be done for sure.,239,,
964,0.97,5632.693,5641.369,"Conversations of issues of Misclassification and long-term solutions for gig workers continue, but I know that we have to act with urgency right now.",239,,
965,0.97,5641.369,5652.446,This crisis of Covid has been telling us that we need to step up in an immediate way to provide these protections for gig workers and looking forward to working with all of you on those next steps.,239,,
966,0.97,5652.446,5661.155,"I know also that we are well aware that gig workers need additional protections, especially because of Covid.",239,,
967,0.97,5661.155,5662.356,We get our groceries delivered.,239,,
968,0.97,5662.356,5663.758,We get food delivered.,239,,
969,0.97,5663.758,5672.4,"We are, I think, in a crisis where many of us are depending on this portion of the economy even more heavily now.",239,,
970,0.97,5672.4,5685.212,So I really think it's important that we're stepping up in an essential way for these workers to make sure they're treated with the basic protections like premium pay and making sure they have safety equipment.,239,,
971,0.97,5685.212,5691.419,"Being told that the unemployment rate is as high, Oh, I'm sorry.",239,,
972,0.97,5691.419,5699.994,"Workers are being told that given how high the unemployment rate is that, you know, some people are being told if you don't like it, then you don't have a job.",239,,
973,0.97,5699.994,5704.432,And you don't have any other recourse.,239,,
974,0.97,5704.432,5706.333,That's absolutely unacceptable.,239,,
975,0.97,5706.333,5715.376,We want to make sure that all workers have these basic protections that we've provided to other sectors of our communities.,239,,
976,0.97,5715.376,5722.616,"So as workers are putting Theirselves, their life at risk, their family's lives at risk by coming to work, they serve our communities.",239,,
977,0.97,5722.616,5728.389,We need to lift them up and make sure these workers get the basic protections they need.,239,,
978,0.97,5728.389,5733.561,Thank you again to all of the folks who worked on this legislation.,239,,
979,0.97,5733.561,5738.599,And thanks to the gig workers who every day take a risk to go to work.,239,,
980,0.97,5738.599,5751.178,Appreciate the time and I'm grateful that through this legislation we're again making labor history and passing this legislation into law.,239,,
981,0.97,5751.178,5759.753,"Great, thank you so much, Councilmember Mosqueda, for those remarks.",240,,
982,0.97,5759.753,5760.221,Councilmember Lewis?,240,,
983,0.97,5760.221,5762.59,"Thank you, Madame President.",241,,
984,0.97,5762.59,5773.367,"I'll be really brief, and I think Councilmember Sawant actually brought this up rather nicely, so I think I'm following on a theme that's been introduced.",241,,
985,0.97,5773.367,5777.037,But this truly does have to be a first step.,241,,
986,0.97,5777.037,5781.342,"And as Councilmember Mosqueda alluded to as well, it is a temporary measure.",241,,
987,0.97,5781.342,5785.112,"You know, Covid some day will pass, and this measure will pass.",241,,
988,0.97,5785.112,5800.961,But we are still going to have massive inequities in this App-Based economy that has been Mischaracterized as a gig economy but really is increasingly the economy.,241,,
989,0.97,5800.961,5805.599,This is how Commerce and business transacted in our society.,241,,
990,0.97,5805.599,5816.744,It's increasingly a space where workers are misclassified as independent contractors to justify paying them less and giving them fewer benefits.,241,,

992,0.97,5829.089,5842.87,"And I know that a lot of our Stakeholders in the community who I really have the pleasure of working with through this, Rachel at working Washington and everyone over at working Washington, Sage and the whole team there are great.",241,,
993,0.97,5842.87,5860.354,I want to thank Camilla Brown on my staff who did an excellent job working with Councilmember Herbold's office to really shepherd this through over the course of the month with lots of Back-To-Back meetings and making sure we were reaching out to all the Stakeholders.,241,,
994,0.97,5860.354,5866.193,Just wanted to extend those thanks and look forward to voting to get it over the finish line today.,241,,
995,0.97,5866.193,5874.635,And thank you all for everything you did to make this a success.,241,,

997,0.97,5876.036,5876.537,Councilmember Sawant?,242,,
998,0.97,5876.537,5876.871,Thank you.,243,,
999,0.97,5876.871,5889.116,"As I mentioned before, I'm happy to vote yes on this bill requiring big businesses to pay hazard pay to gig workers during the Covid crisis.",243,,
1000,0.97,5889.116,5893.053,And I agree with Councilmember Lewis that this is increasingly become the norm.,243,,
1001,0.97,5893.053,5897.324,It's not like we're talking about once small section of the economy.,243,,
1002,0.97,5897.324,5902.863,"So many workers, especially younger workers, are getting pushed into what's called the gig economy.",243,,
1003,0.97,5902.863,5908.736,Those kinds of jobs where they're not recognized as employees.,243,,
1004,0.97,5908.736,5915.075,"Gig workers deliver groceries, drive for Uber and Lith and do many other essential jobs for our society.",243,,
1005,0.97,5915.075,5923.083,These are jobs like any other except they are marked with a legal fiction that they are a One-Person small business rather than a worker at a corporation.,243,,
1006,0.97,5923.083,5931.926,The result of this legal fiction is that workers are suddenly no longer protected by--as workers.,243,,
1007,0.97,5931.926,5947.808,"And by being classified as gig workers, in fact, big business even avoids Seattle's minimum wage by classifying its workers, which is particularly important for the hazard pay bill we're voting on now.",243,,
1008,0.97,5947.808,5955.416,It totally unjust and a clear example how under capitalism the working class must struggle to avoid falling further behind.,243,,
1009,0.97,5955.416,5980.841,"As I mentioned two weeks ago when Council was voting on extended the paid sick leave to gig workers, 100 years ago when workers could--no workers could legally form unions in this country, but courageously they did it anyway, often having to defend their picket lines against physical attack, in fact, by the police and private forces.",243,,
1010,0.97,5980.841,5992.586,"In the 1920s, the U.S. military was called to attack striking miners.",243,,
1011,0.97,5992.586,5996.924,They want labor law protections and they want the right to organize a Union.,243,,
1012,0.97,5996.924,6006.6,"Since then, however, for decades, big business has been attempting to claw back every gain workers had fought for and won.",243,,
1013,0.97,6006.6,6017.544,"Wealth inequality has Ballooned and an estimated one out of five workers in the U.S. is now classified as an independent contractor, a Ka gig worker.",243,,
1014,0.97,6017.544,6026.987,"Gig workers will need to Unionize with or without the legal permission to do so, just like workers in the past, because we only have the power in the workplace when we get organized to fight for it.",243,,
1015,0.97,6026.987,6042.87,"We will need to rebuild the fighting labor movement that overcame legal, physical and political obstacles in the last century to establish the Union workers, the Junes workers can rely on today.",243,,
1016,0.97,6042.87,6055.082,"Today's legislation is extremely temporary, but in approving it, the city council is making an important statement, and I'm happy to support the legislation to extend paid sick and safe time to gig workers also.",243,,
1017,0.97,6055.082,6067.127,"And finally, I want to raise the caution around Enforceent that I had spoken to when this legislation was first discussed in briefing, council briefing, I think, a week ago.",243,,
1018,0.97,6067.127,6077.438,"Seattle's office of labor standards is empowered to enforce these worker's rights, but because so many big businesses engage in wage theft, the office of labor standards has a serious backlog.",243,,

1020,0.97,6083.911,6089.516,We've seen how ruthless giant corporations like Uber can be in disregarding worker's rights.,243,,
1021,0.97,6089.516,6094.021,The Office of labor standards is Understaffed.,243,,
1022,0.97,6094.021,6104.765,"The Mayor is instituting a hiring freeze, claiming there's not the budget.",243,,
1023,0.97,6104.765,6107.401,These budget shortfalls are not automatic.,243,,
1024,0.97,6107.401,6128.655,"If Mayor Durkan and if the political establishment were willing to tax big business, the city could raise the revenue to stop this and create a public jobs program, not only to build social housing and other programs, but also to enhance the staff that we would need to actually fully enforce labor law.",243,,
1025,0.97,6128.655,6134.094,"Gig workers deserve to be protected with their rights, and that means this legislation is an important part of it.",243,,
1026,0.97,6134.094,6141.435,And we also need to end the austerity and inadequate staffing at the office of labor standards.,243,,
1027,0.97,6141.435,6141.702,Thank you.,243,,
1028,0.97,6141.702,6144.204,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",244,,
1029,0.97,6144.204,6148.675,Are there any other Councilmembers who wish to make comments on the bill?,244,,
1030,0.97,6148.675,6149.276,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",244,,
1031,0.97,6149.276,6182.109,"Thank you, I just want to flag that like we have a process and a product keyed up for the TNC drivers for a minimum compensation, I think it's really important that the conversation that we've had around hazard pay also lead to a conversation around minimum compensation for the drivers who deliver groceries and meals from restaurants.",245,,
1032,0.97,6182.109,6202.629,I think there was a lot of interest in seeing whether or not the worker advocates and workers could get to a place with the Apps where they had some agreement on what--not only what those conversations might look like but what the product might be.,245,,
1033,0.97,6202.629,6205.599,"But Unfortunately, we didn't get there.",245,,
1034,0.97,6205.599,6227.554,But I am confident that those conversations will continue and will do everything I can in my role as a Councilmember to support those conversations because it is critically important that folks who are doing this work we can see right now in the state of emergency how critical it is.,245,,
1035,0.97,6227.554,6235.529,It's critically important that these folks receive some form of minimum compensation as well.,245,,
1036,0.97,6235.529,6236.863,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",246,,
1037,0.97,6236.863,6243.537,Are there any other questions or comments on the bill?,246,,

1070,0.97,6335.929,6345.238,"Sorry, it was a little thrown off because I thought there was a technical amendment that needed to be done, or maybe that's going to be done after I speak?",271,,
1071,0.97,6345.238,6346.606,So that's a good flag.,272,,
1072,0.97,6346.606,6349.443,Why don't I give folk as preview quickly.,272,,
1073,0.97,6349.443,6357.017,This is on the ordinance related to prohibiting use of Chokeholds in the city.,272,,
1074,0.97,6357.017,6359.786,The chemical weapons bill is coming next.,272,,
1075,0.97,6359.786,6374.201,So this is just on the Chokeholds and there will be an amendment that will be moved by Councilmember Herbold that was published on the agenda as amendment one.,272,,
1076,0.97,6374.201,6386.713,And then there will be a second amendment by Councilmember Herbold which was published on the agenda as amendment two.,272,,
1077,0.97,6386.713,6390.417,And then we will have an amended bill for consideration.,272,,
1078,0.97,6390.417,6392.919,That's on agenda item two related to Chokeholds.,272,,
1079,0.97,6392.919,6401.461,"I think the technical amendment you're referring to, Councilmember Sawant, might be in the context of agenda item three.",272,,

1083,0.97,6412.139,6415.041,There's a lot going on this morning.,274,,
1084,0.97,6415.041,6421.414,Why don't you go ahead and address the underlying motion first.,274,,
1085,0.97,6421.414,6450.477,"I'm sorry, the underlying bill first and then we will--and you know, you probably want substantive comments here, but if you want to introduce the bill to give Councilmember Herbold's amendment some context, then we'll do the amendments, and of course, as customary, you as the primary sponsor will have the last word on the bill as amended.",274,,
1086,0.97,6450.477,6450.844,Thank you.,275,,
1087,0.97,6450.844,6462.255,"This bill bans Chokeholds in Seattle from Eric garner to Emmanuel Ellis to George Floyd, we've all seen the devastating consequences of Chokeholds, use of Chokeholds by the police.",275,,
1088,0.97,6462.255,6474.534,"As I mentioned last week and also this morning, similar restrictions have been put in place by other cities, most recently Minneapolis, where George Floyd was murdered by the police using a Chokehold.",275,,
1089,0.97,6474.534,6486.913,"This legislation is absolutely the least that the Seattle city council can do, and I hope that we can pass it and move on to the ban on crowd control weapons, also without loopholes.",275,,
1090,0.97,6486.913,6496.356,And many of the other measure that is we need to put in place in order to really even begin to have accountability on the police.,275,,
1091,0.97,6496.356,6500.694,I do want to reiterate a sobering word of caution.,275,,
1092,0.97,6500.694,6506.8,"Passing this legislation is absolutely important, but it will not be enough by itself.",275,,
1093,0.97,6506.8,6515.275,"Chokeholds were banned in New York City when Eric garner was killed, and that obviously was insufficient to save him.",275,,
1094,0.97,6515.275,6524.184,Legislation like this is critical because--especially because it shows the power of a grassroots movement overcoming an entrenched establishment for so many decades.,275,,
1095,0.97,6524.184,6541.434,"But it needs to be paired with more structural changes in society, and that is why I will be--my office will be pushing for most of the other demands we have.",275,,
1096,0.97,6541.434,6572.165,"One is to immediately release all protest Arrestees and drop charges against them, to Defund the police by 50% so we can begin to fund rest RA Tif justice and really community organizing as opposed to policing, organized by workers who are unionized and paid a living wage, especially to respond to noncriminal emergency calls as has been called for by the police accountability organization of the Bay area.",275,,
1097,0.97,6572.165,6575.702,But we also need a Community-Elected oversight board.,275,,

1099,0.97,6580.273,6580.874,Thank you.,275,,
1100,0.97,6580.874,6581.975,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",276,,
1101,0.97,6581.975,6587.48,I'm going to go ahead and hand it over to Councilmember Herbold who has a couple of amendments.,276,,

1103,0.97,6591.384,6591.785,Thank you.,277,,
1104,0.97,6591.785,6600.76,I move to amend Council bill 119804 as presented on amendment one on the agenda.,277,,
1105,0.97,6600.76,6602.629,Is there a second?,278,,
1106,0.97,6602.629,6602.929,Second.,279,,
1107,0.97,6602.929,6603.33,Second.,280,,
1108,0.97,6603.33,6604.297,Thank you.,281,,
1109,0.97,6604.297,6609.302,It's been moved and Seconded to amend the bill with amendment one.,281,,
1110,0.97,6609.302,6610.37,Councilmember Herbold has sponsored the amendment.,281,,
1111,0.97,6610.37,6613.373,I will hand it over to you to address it.,281,,
1112,0.97,6613.373,6613.974,Thank you.,282,,
1113,0.97,6613.974,6620.747,So this amendment is responsive to concerns raised and shared with Councilmembers from the law Department.,282,,
1114,0.97,6620.747,6623.917,It addresses two separate issues in the single amendment.,282,,
1115,0.97,6623.917,6635.028,The first is to clarify that the private right of action applies to violations of the prohibition that occur after the ordinance takes effect.,282,,
1116,0.97,6635.028,6648.308,"And the second requests that the notice of the Chokehold prohibition be given to the Department of justice, the court and the monitor in accordance with the consent decree.",282,,
1117,0.97,6648.308,6650.877,United States of America versus city of Seattle.,282,,
1118,0.97,6650.877,6658.084,This use of force is at the heart of the consent decree and changes to city policies need to be submitted to the court.,282,,
1119,0.97,6658.084,6672.999,The city sent a draft version of the 2017 accountability legislation to the court in advance and similarly this amendment indicates that Council recognizes the role of the court.,282,,
1120,0.97,6672.999,6676.369,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for that description.",283,,
1121,0.97,6676.369,6682.809,Are there any comments on amendment one?,283,,
1122,0.97,6682.809,6683.009,Okay.,283,,
1123,0.97,6683.009,6689.883,"I'm not hearing any comments on amendment one, and again, Councilmember Herbold, I appreciate you bringing forward this amendment.",283,,
1124,0.97,6689.883,6708.935,"I would say that it sort of models the approach that we took with the 2017 police accountability ordinance in which we legislated some of the policy issues first, recognizing that those policy changes would be subject to court review under the consent decree.",283,,
1125,0.97,6708.935,6727.353,"I think your amendment in this base is consistent with what the Council has done in the past, sort of knowing we're changing policies that fall under Purview of the consent decree and not Abdicating the need to submit for review under the consent decree.",283,,
1126,0.97,6727.353,6729.389,So I appreciate your work on this amendment.,283,,
1127,0.97,6729.389,6733.193,"If there are no questions or comments, we'll move along.",283,,

1152,0.97,6777.77,6783.643,So I would hand it back over to Councilmember Herbold to walk us through amendment two.,303,,
1153,0.97,6783.643,6796.856,Amendment two simply expresses the Council's intent to engage with labor relations and the implementation of the Chokehold prohibition.,304,,
1154,0.97,6796.856,6797.857,Thank you so much.,305,,

1160,0.97,6812.405,6814.073,Thank you so much.,307,,
1161,0.97,6814.073,6815.408,Is there a second?,307,,
1162,0.97,6815.408,6815.809,Second.,308,,
1163,0.97,6815.809,6821.814,It's been moved and Seconded to amend the bill as described in amendment two.,309,,
1164,0.97,6821.814,6827.654,"And then Councilmember Herbold, you gave us a succinct description of what that was, do you want to repeat that?",309,,
1165,0.97,6827.654,6833.526,"We have the context of the amendment itself before us, before I describe it.",310,,
1166,0.97,6833.526,6847.907,The amendment expresses the Council's intent to engage with our labor relations Department in the implementation of the Chokehold ban or prohibition.,310,,
1167,0.97,6847.907,6849.075,Thank you so much.,311,,

1190,0.97,6893.92,6895.154,Thank you.,331,,
1191,0.97,6895.154,6895.922,The motion carries.,331,,
1192,0.97,6895.922,6902.929,The amendment is adopted and we now have a further amended bill before the Council.,331,,
1193,0.97,6902.929,6909.903,Are there any further comments on the bill as amended?,331,,
1194,0.97,6909.903,6910.103,Okay.,331,,
1195,0.97,6910.103,6919.512,"I'm not seeing anybody raise their hand, but I will, as promised, give Councilmember Sawant the last word on this bill as the primary sponsor.",331,,
1196,0.97,6919.512,6919.979,Councilmember Sawant?,331,,
1197,0.97,6919.979,6920.313,Thank you.,332,,
1198,0.97,6920.313,6925.051,I think it's really important that this bill is being passed.,332,,
1199,0.97,6925.051,6932.525,It's also important that the bill that's coming up on the chemical weapons be passed without loopholes.,332,,
1200,0.97,6932.525,6950.076,"But as members of the public have said, and I completely agree with them, this is the absolute bare minimum that the highest legislative body of this city should be doing, especially after we have seen such unbelievable violence targeted at peaceful protesters.",332,,
1201,0.97,6950.076,6971.264,"But also in the wake of the fact that eight black and Brown community members have been murdered by the police, Seattle police, under Mayor Durkan's reign and not a single police officer has been prosecuted to the larger context of this is extremely important for us to remember.",332,,
1202,0.97,6971.264,6984.777,"While these bills will be historic, because it is in some ways quite absurd that we have a city that does not have already a law that bans Chokeholds and chemical weapons, but it is important we're doing this today.",332,,
1203,0.97,6984.777,6987.647,"But we have to go much, much farther.",332,,
1204,0.97,6987.647,7002.595,The police officers who have committed such horrific crimes need to be brought to justice and they will not happen as long as the establishment is overseeing it because we saw what happened under Mayor Durkan and what has happened in the past years.,332,,
1205,0.97,7002.595,7018.044,And so the city and the people of the city needs an independently elected board.,332,,
1206,0.97,7018.044,7033.426,But we also need to urgently Defund the police by at least 50% and make sure that the establishment doesn't just take on the vocabulary of the movement but actually responds with real action.,332,,
1207,0.97,7033.426,7041.901,"And most immediately, we need to make sure that all the protest Arrestees are released without charges.",332,,
1208,0.97,7041.901,7042.168,Thank you.,332,,
1209,0.97,7042.168,7044.303,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant, for those final remarks.",333,,
1210,0.97,7044.303,7051.043,I'm going to go ahead and close out debate on this bill as amended.,333,,
1211,0.97,7051.043,7057.316,I would ask the clerk call the roll on the passage of the bill as amended.,333,,

1232,0.97,7075.768,7079.305,The bill passes as amended and the chair will sign it.,353,,
1233,0.97,7079.305,7085.878,I'd ask the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation.,353,,
1234,0.97,7085.878,7086.446,"Okay, agenda item three.",353,,
1235,0.97,7086.446,7095.388,I would ask that the clerk please read item three into the record.,353,,
1236,0.97,7095.388,7096.556,Agenda item three.,354,,
1237,0.97,7096.556,7111.671,"Council bill 119805 relating to the Seattle police Department banning the ownership, purchase, rent, storage and use of crowd control weapons and adding a new section, 3.28.146 of the Seattle municipal code.",354,,
1238,0.97,7111.671,7113.906,"Thank you, Amelia.",355,,
1239,0.97,7113.906,7117.51,So I am going to go ahead and put the bill before us.,355,,
1240,0.97,7117.51,7123.282,I'm going to move to pass Council bill 119805.,355,,
1241,0.97,7123.282,7124.55,Is there a second?,355,,
1242,0.97,7124.55,7125.318,Second.,356,,
1243,0.97,7125.318,7128.788,It's been moved and Seconded to pass the bill.,357,,
1244,0.97,7128.788,7144.47,"Councilmember Sawant, you are the sponsor of the bill so you are once again recognized to--in order to address the underlying bill.",357,,
1245,0.97,7144.47,7151.644,And then we have several amendments to walk through.,357,,
1246,0.97,7151.644,7152.111,Councilmember Sawant?,357,,
1247,0.97,7152.111,7152.345,Yes.,358,,
1248,0.97,7152.345,7162.255,"I actually want to--I want to speak to the bill, but I also want to move to amend Council bill 119805 as presented on amendment three.",358,,
1249,0.97,7162.255,7165.391,So I want to know the order in which I should do that.,358,,
1250,0.97,7165.391,7168.828,Should I speak to the base amendment and then move the amendment?,358,,
1251,0.97,7168.828,7175.835,So I think we're going to take the amendments in the order that they were published.,359,,
1252,0.97,7175.835,7201.427,"So that's two amendments from Councilmember Herbold, and I know that you circulated--your office, excuse me, your office circulated an amendment three after the noon deadline, so I would ask that we go through the amendments as they were published on the agenda and then consider amendment three if it's needed.",359,,
1253,0.97,7201.427,7218.844,"It's a little bit of a Jenga puzzle we're going through because there are portions of your amendment, Councilmember Sawant, amendment three, that would incorporate components of Councilmember Herbold's amendments as represented in both amendment one and amendment two.",359,,
1254,0.97,7218.844,7233.893,"So depending on how amendment one and amendment two shake out, we may not need amendment three or we may need all of amendment three if Councilmember Herbold's amendments do not pass.",359,,
1255,0.97,7233.893,7243.169,"So I think what we should do in fairness here, because it's confusing and there's been a lot of back and forth in Email.",359,,
1256,0.97,7243.169,7249.809,And I want to make sure all our colleagues and the public have a full understanding of the sweep of amendments before us.,359,,
1257,0.97,7249.809,7259.385,"I think before calling anything to a vote, I think it would be prudent for us to have a conversation of all three amendments.",359,,
1258,0.97,7259.385,7265.725,"And so that we can get an understanding of amendment one, amendment two and amendment three.",359,,
1259,0.97,7265.725,7273.733,But I will be planning on calling for a vote on the amendments in the order they were presented on the agenda.,359,,
1260,0.97,7273.733,7280.94,"I'm happen Foy have a conversation about all of them, but just in terms of the order, I just wanted to clarify.",360,,
1261,0.97,7280.94,7293.352,I don't agree with your description of the order in the sense that our--the bill that came from my office has been there long before Councilmember Herbold brought her amendments.,360,,
1262,0.97,7293.352,7304.864,I just want to clarify to the members of the public that what my office published after noon incorporates components of Councilmember Herbold's amendment that I don't object to.,360,,
1263,0.97,7304.864,7309.101,So it's a hybrid bill except for the amendment that I deeply object to.,360,,
1264,0.97,7309.101,7326.452,"So it's not accurate to say that my bill came after hers, and as a matter of fact, this bill, this amendment that Councilmember Herbold has, which will really be a really tack on the bill, was sent out by her at 11:12 A.M.",360,,
1265,0.97,7326.452,7330.556,"This morning, giving the public about two hours and 45 minutes to see it.",360,,
1266,0.97,7330.556,7333.292,So I just wanted to clarify that.,360,,
1267,0.97,7333.292,7345.805,And I would say that the fair way to do it is to consider amendment three because it's basically my bill with the amendments from Councilmember Herbold that I don't have an objection to.,360,,
1268,0.97,7345.805,7360.453,"And because my bill came before everything else, I think that should be considered, so amendment three should be considered, in my view, but--and if you want to respond to that, I'll stop, or I'll continue with my description.",360,,
1269,0.97,7360.453,7363.355,"Yeah, I think you've made your record.",361,,
1270,0.97,7363.355,7366.359,I don't think I said anything inconsistent.,361,,
1271,0.97,7366.359,7371.23,"If I used the word bill, that was an inadvertent use of the word bill.",361,,
1272,0.97,7371.23,7382.708,"What I'm saying is your amendment three was not published on the agenda, at least on the version of the agenda I have, was not published on the agenda.",361,,
1273,0.97,7382.708,7387.413,Am I wrong that your amendment three was published on the agenda?,361,,
1274,0.97,7387.413,7389.515,"No, no, you're not wrong.",362,,
1275,0.97,7389.515,7407.633,All I'm trying to clarify is that bill--it was just with the intention of SIMPLIFYING the work by incorporating Councilmember Herbold's bills that we don't disagree with so that the discussion was focused on the key amendment which I don't believe should be passed by the city council.,362,,
1276,0.97,7407.633,7408.667,I hear you.,363,,
1277,0.97,7408.667,7410.002,I do hear you.,363,,
1278,0.97,7410.002,7419.612,I just wanted to clarify I didn't mean to imply that somehow--I'm not trying to make any sort of--I'm not trying to imply anything.,363,,
1279,0.97,7419.612,7423.816,I just want to make sure we have the sequence of how we got the amendments.,363,,
1280,0.97,7423.816,7431.457,There were two amendments that were published on Friday to the public and to Councilmembers.,363,,
1281,0.97,7431.457,7434.16,Amendment three came to us at noon.,363,,
1282,0.97,7434.16,7446.305,"And I understand that there's nothing necessarily new in there because you're incorporating portions of things that were already published, and I think that's maybe where we're getting our Semantics crossed.",363,,
1283,0.97,7446.305,7449.809,And I'm following now.,363,,
1284,0.97,7449.809,7455.347,So thank you for patience and your understanding on that.,363,,
1285,0.97,7455.347,7469.795,"So I think just so that we have a Holistic conversation about it instead of--I think it would be prudent for us to go through each of the motions, but I'm not going to call for a vote on the motions.",363,,
1286,0.97,7469.795,7477.169,I want to sort of hear how conversation goes before we start calling for motions.,363,,
1287,0.97,7477.169,7485.911,"But why don't we go ahead and start at this point, Councilmember Sawant, since you are the prime sponsor of the bill.",363,,
1288,0.97,7485.911,7504.029,"And I need you to address the underlying bill, I will hand the floor over to you to, as the prime sponsor of the bill, to address the substantive bill and in doing so, you are free to describe your amendment, your proposed amendment three.",363,,
1289,0.97,7504.029,7510.302,"Again, not asking you to make a formal motion yet, just describe and talk to us about your proposed amendment three.",363,,
1290,0.97,7510.302,7516.275,And then we will hear from Councilmember Herbold accordingly.,363,,
1291,0.97,7516.275,7518.31,"So Councilmember Sawant, floor is yours.",363,,
1292,0.97,7518.31,7521.08,"Thank you, president Gonzalez.",364,,
1293,0.97,7521.08,7521.514,I appreciate that.,364,,
1294,0.97,7521.514,7541.634,"The bill that's under consideration now from our movement and from my office bans the city from owning and the police from using crowd control weapons like tear gas, Mace, blast balls, flash bangs, plastic bullets and other weapon that is are typically used Indiscriminately on gatherings of protesters.",364,,
1295,0.97,7541.634,7564.423,"Some of these weapons, like tear gas, have been banned for decades from use in war by the Geneva convention, and yet, the Mayor of Seattle, Jenny Durkan, and Seattle police under her control have repeatedly, on a daily basis, used them since the George Floyd protests began on May 30th against the people of Seattle.",364,,
1296,0.97,7564.423,7569.929,"As we've discussed before, many of us have witnessed it.",364,,
1297,0.97,7569.929,7572.865,Many of us have experienced it in the members of the public.,364,,
1298,0.97,7572.865,7578.871,For days the Seattle police Department used these weapons on the streets of Capitol Hill.,364,,
1299,0.97,7578.871,7585.511,They falsely claimed that the protesters were violent rioters and they had no al Terntive.,364,,
1300,0.97,7585.511,7586.378,That's absolutely untrue.,364,,
1301,0.97,7586.378,7588.48,It could not be more untrue.,364,,
1302,0.97,7588.48,7608.2,"They've even attempted to maintain those lives in the face of Video evidence showing us that the police were the source and the sole source of violence and that they were not, quote Unquote, responding to any situation but that they were there with the intention of inflicting violence.",364,,
1303,0.97,7608.2,7623.415,"We have evidence that the police were source of the violence even further now because after the mounting public outrage eventually forced Mayor Jenny Durkan to pull the police back from the streets of Capitol Hill, the violence has left with them.",364,,
1304,0.97,7623.415,7630.422,"There is nobody there with riot gear, armed to the hit with all kinds of equipment and chemical weapons.",364,,
1305,0.97,7630.422,7633.392,"There's no such thing, only the police have them.",364,,
1306,0.97,7633.392,7639.965,"Near Seattle and around the country, demonstrators have been Grieviously injured by these weapons.",364,,
1307,0.97,7639.965,7648.64,"In an open letter signed by over 1,000 medical professionals, has explained weapons like tear gas and Mace significantly increase the danger of Covid.",364,,
1308,0.97,7648.64,7653.212,"We need to ban these weapons, which have been misused for decades.",364,,
1309,0.97,7653.212,7657.082,The police and political establishment simply cannot be trusted with them.,364,,
1310,0.97,7657.082,7666.759,"Seattle police might argue that without tear gas, rubber bullets and blast balls, they will use even more lethal weapons against demonstrators.",364,,
1311,0.97,7666.759,7669.395,We have to completely reject this dangerous argument.,364,,
1312,0.97,7669.395,7678.303,The purpose of this legislation is to prevent the police from meeting protests with any violence whatsoever.,364,,
1313,0.97,7678.303,7697.956,"If the Seattle police instead show up with more lethal weaponry, that would be absolutely devastating and disastrous, but that would only--and I hope that doesn't happen, but that would only prove the point that this black lives matter movement is making, which is that it does not work for us to have a police state.",364,,
1314,0.97,7697.956,7705.631,We need our community to be organized for us to keep ourselves safe and for public safety for all.,364,,
1315,0.97,7705.631,7713.305,If Seattle passes this legislation it will be historic and it will be an inspiration for what movement around the country can win.,364,,
1316,0.97,7713.305,7716.642,But we also need to remember that this won't be enough.,364,,
1317,0.97,7716.642,7727.686,"We will need to go much farther with all the steps that I was outlining earlier, which I will reiterate once again later before passage of this bill.",364,,
1318,0.97,7727.686,7754.346,"Just wanted to quickly say that, you know, in terms of making sure that the public 1 on the same page of us in terms of understanding the process, at some point Councilmember Herbold's amendment will be considered, which on the face of it, claims that all it's doing is clarifying what is crowd control, that it is simply intended to say the legislation does not apply to Noncrod control situations.",364,,
1319,0.97,7754.346,7763.222,"But what it will actually do is create giant, Truck-Sized loopholes that will allow the use of these type of weapons in virtually any situation.",364,,
1320,0.97,7763.222,7767.092,The problem is that Seattle police will abuse those loopholes.,364,,
1321,0.97,7767.092,7775.434,Look at what happened after the Mayor's much publicized 30-day ban.,364,,
1322,0.97,7775.434,7784.209,They simply do not have the track record to lead us to believe we can trust them to not use weapons on peaceful protests.,364,,
1323,0.97,7784.209,7792.885,"We heard testimony that said a woman took a flash bang grenade in the chest and almost died, and had to be revived with multiple Cpr routines.",364,,
1324,0.97,7792.885,7801.96,"That's an important example of why, in my view, it would be horrific to pass Councilmember Herbold's amendment.",364,,
1325,0.97,7801.96,7804.997,It brings up the question of what kind of society we want to be.,364,,
1326,0.97,7804.997,7822.681,It will be sending a message to Úthe people of Seattle whether that amendment is passed or not which side the Council is actually on and whether the Council is actually doing everything in its power to prevent such occurrences and to prevent such violence.,364,,
1327,0.97,7822.681,7828.787,"I have more points on the amendment that Councilmember Herbold has, which I hope that she just WITHDRAWS.",364,,
1328,0.97,7828.787,7831.089,I honestly am being very honest.,364,,
1329,0.97,7831.089,7855.314,"I hope that Councilmember Herbold has taken to heart the incredibly powerful public testimony that we have heard and that she puts that in front of her and understands that we cannot, you know, we cannot have politicians Coopt the language, the vocabulary of movement and say we're going to Reimagine the police and we're going to dismantle the police and then refuse to do the bare minimum.",364,,
1330,0.97,7855.314,7867.726,"I hope Councilmember Herbold WITHDRAWS her amendment and that we are able to, as a city Council, unanimously pass this legislation.",364,,
1331,0.97,7867.726,7868.961,All right.,365,,
1332,0.97,7868.961,7870.796,Sorry for my delay.,365,,
1333,0.97,7870.796,7871.496,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,365,,
1334,0.97,7871.496,7899.124,"Can you specifically just before we open it up for more comment and consideration of the amendments, because I want to be really clear as to what language in the amendments you see is being a loophole, in large part because your amendment three incorporates some of the language in Councilmember Herbold's amendments but does not incorporate other parts.",365,,
1335,0.97,7899.124,7924.983,So could you walk us through what portions of Councilmember Herbold's amendment one and two you favor and what specific language you believe is problematic to the underlying intent of your Council bill.,365,,
1336,0.97,7924.983,7925.951,Yes.,366,,
1337,0.97,7925.951,7939.431,"To do it in a brief summary, I will say just to keep it short, I will say that I don't necessarily think the other amendments are that great, but I don't object to them.",366,,
1338,0.97,7939.431,7944.169,I'm glad that Councilmember Herbold has withdrawn her intention to delay the vote on the bill.,366,,
1339,0.97,7944.169,7947.939,So that's not--no longer a question.,366,,
1340,0.97,7947.939,7970.429,"What I am objecting to and what you heard, what we all heard powerful public testimony on is on page two of what is titled as amendment number two, that is, shows response to Councilmember Herbold.",366,,
1341,0.97,7970.429,7976.168,And that is section D in the amended version by Councilmember Herbold.,366,,
1342,0.97,7976.168,7978.403,That section D is amendment is what I'm objecting to.,366,,
1343,0.97,7978.403,7985.41,I want to read that out and explain it a little bit.,366,,
1344,0.97,7985.41,8017.442,"That amendment says kinetic impact, projectiles, acoustic weapons, directed energy weapons, water Cannons, Disorientation devices, ultrasonic Cannons or any other device that is designed to be used on multiple individuals for crowd control and is designed to cause pain or discomfort is not a crowd control weapon with the purpose of owning, purchasing, renting or storing under the subsection, if the device is used for a purpose other than crowd dispersal.",366,,
1345,0.97,8017.442,8060.085,"The problem with this amendment is it leaves up to the police to decide what they were actually doing and claim that it was not for crowd dispersal or for crowd control because, you know, I mean just to explain, this amendment would--from Councilmember Herbold would create an exception that says any of these weapons, the number of weapons I mentioned, including direct energy weapons and tear gas and flash bangs and ultrasonic Cannons, Wb used if, and I quote, the device is used for a purpose other than crowd dispersal.",366,,
1346,0.97,8060.085,8060.352,Unquote.,366,,
1347,0.97,8060.352,8066.792,That means the ban would be somewhat meaningless by itself because the police can say they're owning them to use for other purposes.,366,,
1348,0.97,8066.792,8069.428,"You know, it wouldn't stop them from buying them.",366,,
1349,0.97,8069.428,8081.64,It would also mean they could be used anywhere as long as the police claim that they are--that the specific use of the weapon was not for crowd dispersal.,366,,
1350,0.97,8081.64,8112.404,"For example, if the police say that there is a person in the middle of the protest and they just don't like that because the person is saying something or because they threw an empty water bottle at the police, then--and if the police respond to that person by spraying the crowd, supposedly to stop that person from throwing a water bottle, then suddenly under this amendment, if this amendment passes, then this would be allowed by--under this bill, under Councilmember Herbold's bill.",366,,
1351,0.97,8112.404,8121.513,"Which is basically for the police to respond to somebody throwing a water bottle by spraying the entire crowd, including children, with Mace or pepper spray or tear gas.",366,,
1352,0.97,8121.513,8124.349,And I use this example because this is not a hypothetical situation.,366,,
1353,0.97,8124.349,8132.057,This is what we saw again and again on the streets of Seattle with police officers using the fiction that they were somehow in danger.,366,,
1354,0.97,8132.057,8136.161,And I've seen chief best making the same arguments that sometimes the police were hurt.,366,,
1355,0.97,8136.161,8141.466,How is it possible the police were hurt with water bottles?,366,,
1356,0.97,8141.466,8149.541,"Let me be clear, let's contrast the water bottle with the police who have been--they don't come just by themselves as police officers.",366,,
1357,0.97,8149.541,8150.408,They come as riot police.,366,,
1358,0.97,8150.408,8165.19,"They come there to start a riot, which means that they are armed to the teeth with riot gear protected with helmets, face shields, body shields, shoulder, arm, cuff and Shin pads, Batons.",366,,
1359,0.97,8165.19,8173.465,"I mean, it's absolute Gaslighting for the police to even remotely claim we need to allow them any leeway to use these weapons.",366,,
1360,0.97,8173.465,8184.709,"On Sunday, when the SPD, you know, Sunday a week and a half ago, and the SPD used flash bang, tear gas, pepper spray on myself and other protesters.",366,,
1361,0.97,8184.709,8188.68,"At that point they claimed it was to get people to back up, not to disperse.",366,,
1362,0.97,8188.68,8191.383,And we were doing nothing.,366,,
1363,0.97,8191.383,8192.484,We were peacefully protesting.,366,,
1364,0.97,8192.484,8192.984,Those are our streets.,366,,
1365,0.97,8192.984,8195.82,We were demanding the right to walk on those streets.,366,,
1366,0.97,8195.82,8198.19,That's all we did is walk forward.,366,,
1367,0.97,8198.19,8210.702,"So any time we make a restriction on police brutality depending on the purpose or the intent of the officers, that creates a loophole that can then encompass the whole word because you can never prove intent.",366,,
1368,0.97,8210.702,8223.181,That's the point behind the whole campaign of not this time is to go after this whole insidious idea that unless you can prove the police had malicious intent you can't hold them responsible.,366,,
1369,0.97,8223.181,8231.122,"This situation is not the same, but it's analogous to that situation where it comes down to the police claiming that it was not for crowd dispersal.",366,,
1370,0.97,8231.122,8237.195,So I would really urge Councilmembers to reject this loophole.,366,,
1371,0.97,8237.195,8242.567,"I mean, this whole protest movement, this whole uprising is against police violence and brutality.",366,,
1372,0.97,8242.567,8250.242,You cannot have politicians saying black lives matter and you stand with the movement and then turn around and pass loopholes that hand the power back to the police.,366,,
1373,0.97,8250.242,8257.048,I second the person who said in public comment of the fact that they're having to discuss this is repulsive.,366,,
1374,0.97,8257.048,8264.923,"I will say this, if this amendment passes, it will be a continuation of the past Pro-Police policies of the Democratic politicians on the city council.",366,,
1375,0.97,8264.923,8270.695,"And it will be nothing less--and I don't say this lightly, it will be nothing less than a racist amendment.",366,,
1376,0.97,8270.695,8274.799,And it would be a betrayal of the movement and of the black community.,366,,
1377,0.97,8274.799,8277.402,This is not a small thing.,366,,
1378,0.97,8277.402,8289.848,"I really hope that this amendment does not pass and better yet, I would urge Councilmember Herbold to withdraw this amendment.",366,,
1379,0.97,8289.848,8292.117,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",367,,
1380,0.97,8292.117,8308.133,"So what I heard from you in particular that in terms of the full breadth of amendment two, you read directly from amendment two the language that you think creates the loophole in the way that you have described it.",367,,
1381,0.97,8308.133,8342.033,"In other words, if the police Department is allowed to continue to purchase chemical weapons that are used for crowd dispersal currently allowed to be used for crowd dispersal, but prohibited from being used in crowd dispersal in the future, sort of allowing them to continue to have possession of these types of weapons undermines the broader goal of being able to control how they use it.",367,,
1382,0.97,8342.033,8357.182,"And sort of your argument, I'm hearing, is, you know, we should have a policy position of not allowing the police Department to own these chemical weapons for any purpose, but in particular for crowd dispersal use.",367,,
1383,0.97,8357.182,8371.963,"And it's too hard for us to figure out how to control the legitimacy of the position that might be taken by the police Department that they were using it for, quote, crowd dispersal, close quote.",367,,
1384,0.97,8371.963,8380.205,I really want to sort of zero in on the part of the amendment two that you find most problematic.,367,,
1385,0.97,8380.205,8389.781,"And I'm hearing that that is the language and those are the, in general, a summary of the reasons why you think it is problematic.",367,,
1386,0.97,8389.781,8390.482,"Generally, I agree.",368,,
1387,0.97,8390.482,8396.254,"But I would, of course, put it in very strong terms as I did before.",368,,
1388,0.97,8396.254,8397.188,But also just to clarify.,368,,
1389,0.97,8397.188,8405.063,"Absolutely, it is about not allowing the police to have possession of these weapons, but that is related to the fact that we cannot trust them.",368,,
1390,0.97,8405.063,8413.638,"And if anything's been established about the police without any doubt, it's that they cannot be trusted because they have broken that trust every single time.",368,,
1391,0.97,8413.638,8421.513,"As I said, a concrete example I used was something I personally experienced and witnessed where the police did say, this is not for crowd dispersal.",368,,
1392,0.97,8421.513,8424.549,The next thing you know they were dispersing the crowd with tear gas.,368,,
1393,0.97,8424.549,8430.021,"They said it was not for crowd dispersal, only because we were moving forward.",368,,
1394,0.97,8430.021,8430.422,That's my point.,368,,
1395,0.97,8430.422,8430.889,It's already happened.,368,,
1396,0.97,8430.889,8437.929,"We have examples that show if we pass this loophole, what happened on Sunday night, what happened on the night before will continue to happen even under that law.",368,,
1397,0.97,8437.929,8441.399,That's why we have to reject the amendment.,368,,
1398,0.97,8441.399,8441.666,Got it.,369,,
1399,0.97,8441.666,8441.866,Okay.,369,,
1400,0.97,8441.866,8458.75,That's very helpful I think to me and members of the public to hear a little more clearly about where the difference lies between amendment three and some of the language of this amendment that you included there but not this particular language.,369,,
1401,0.97,8458.75,8483.274,I do want to go ahead and provide Councilmember Herbold an opportunity to address both that specific language in amendment two that she has put forth in front of the council as well as having her describe other parts of amendment two.,369,,
1402,0.97,8483.274,8484.576,And then also amendment one.,369,,
1403,0.97,8484.576,8501.693,So why don't we go ahead and shift over to Councilmember Herbold to respond to your concerns related to amendment two to Describpects of amendment two and also walk us through amendment one.,369,,
1404,0.97,8501.693,8503.761,Thank you very much.,370,,
1405,0.97,8503.761,8506.631,So amendment one does several things.,370,,
1406,0.97,8506.631,8516.941,It AMENDS the recital clause as it relates specifically to the actions of SPD over the last few weeks around escalation of crowd violence.,370,,
1407,0.97,8516.941,8532.557,"It adds a new recital reflecting the findings from the June 12, 2020 office of the inspector General Court less lethal weapons in protest.",370,,
1408,0.97,8532.557,8536.16,It makes some changes to section one.,370,,
1409,0.97,8536.16,8547.505,One is to exempt from the prohibition of crowd control weapons any device that meets the definition of the crowd control weapon but is not used for crowd dispersal purposes.,370,,
1410,0.97,8547.505,8553.912,And also in section one there are some other technical and legal changes.,370,,
1411,0.97,8553.912,8581.372,"It requests that the police accountability agencies provide by August 15, 2020 a recommendation on the use of crowd control weapons for crowd dispersal to include suggested policy revisions to the SPD manual, identification of a crowd dispersal Aught Saix process that requires the executive approval and requires best practices in policing to not harm protesters.",370,,
1412,0.97,8581.372,8592.083,"It is, of course, the statutory of the OPA, CPC and Oig to do this in the 2017 accountability ordinance that Council approved.",370,,
1413,0.97,8592.083,8599.39,And really want to lift up their authority to consult with the Council in these areas.,370,,
1414,0.97,8599.39,8624.048,"This in no way, this request for a report back in no way, as we have heard from some folks in public testimony, I'm not sure where people are getting the information, but maybe it's just because it's the short turnaround, this request of the OPA, Oig and CPC to report back to Council does not in any way delay implementation of this legislation.",370,,
1415,0.97,8624.048,8639.897,"The bill--the amendment, like the bill before it, requests that there be notice of the prohibition against crowd control weapons to the Department of justice, the court and the monitor in accordance with the consent decree.",370,,
1416,0.97,8639.897,8647.305,Use of force is at the heart of the concept decree and changes to city policies must be submitted to the court.,370,,
1417,0.97,8647.305,8653.277,And the amendment indicates that the Council recognizes the role of the court there.,370,,
1418,0.97,8653.277,8669.494,"And then also, similarly to what we just did in the earlier bill, the amendment expresses the Council's intent to support labor relations in the implementation of the prohibition against crowd control weapon use.",370,,
1419,0.97,8669.494,8687.378,"And then finally it adds as an attachment the less lethal weapons in protest report from the office of the inspector general for public safety jointly issued with the OPA on June 12, 2020.",370,,
1420,0.97,8687.378,8708.366,"At this time, I would like to offer or invite, I should say, amendment to my amendment one as it relates specifically to the section where we exempt the prohibition of crowd control weapons when a device that meets that definition is not used for crowd dispersal purposes.",370,,
1421,0.97,8708.366,8747.738,"This has become, I think, a distraction around the intent of the amendment, and you know, from my perspective offering this was just merely consistent with the title of the bill itself which talks about crowd control weapons and recognizes that there are some circumstances where the police Department has things to do Besides crowd dispersal where a less lethal tool like these might be useful.",370,,
1422,0.97,8747.738,8792.049,"Again, I invite any Councilmember to amend Council--I'm sorry, amendment one to remove the new language under section D, which says kinetic impact projectiles, chemical irritants, acoustic weapons, directed energy weapons, water Cannons, Disorientation devices, ultrasonic Cannons or any other device that is designed to be used on multiple individuals for crowd control and is designed to cause pain or discomfort is not a crowd control weapon for the purpose of owning, purchasing, renting or storing under subsection 3.28.146A, if the device is used for a purpose other than crowd dispersal.",370,,
1423,0.97,8792.049,8803.628,"So again, an amendment to that would remove that language as I just read and Reinsert the old section D language.",370,,
1424,0.97,8803.628,8819.143,"Madame President, may I make such motion as Councilmember Juarez to strike the Foresaid language of Councilmember Herbold regarding amendment two that it be stricken?",371,,
1425,0.97,8819.143,8820.444,Okay.,372,,
1426,0.97,8820.444,8831.722,"So let me confer--let me confer with our clerk, Amelia Sanchez, who is on the line.",372,,
1427,0.97,8831.722,8849.006,"There has been expressed interest from Councilmember Juarez to strike subsection D from Amendmen, which is the Herbold amendment.",372,,
1428,0.97,8849.006,8857.415,Can you please advise the Council on the procedural rules related to such an amendment?,372,,
1429,0.97,8857.415,8860.551,"Councilmembers, this is Amelia Sanchez.",373,,
1430,0.97,8860.551,8867.792,"At this point, this motion has not been made or it's also not before the Council.",373,,
1431,0.97,8867.792,8870.895,This is just for discussion.,373,,
1432,0.97,8870.895,8874.632,"So therefore, it's the sponsor that can modify the amendment.",373,,
1433,0.97,8874.632,8876.901,"So therefore, you have a couple options.",373,,
1434,0.97,8876.901,8892.984,"One, when the motion is made, we can consider a modified amendment, which would be with the exception of that section--subsection D, if that is the only amendment that is being proposed to be removed at this point.",373,,
1435,0.97,8892.984,8908.432,"So Council President, for clarification to Madame clerk, do I withdraw my motion to strike and allow Councilmember Herbold to reintroduce her amended amendment?",374,,
1436,0.97,8908.432,8912.703,"Councilmember Juarez, at this point, you are welcome to withdraw your amendment.",375,,
1437,0.97,8912.703,8917.842,At this point it has not been Seconded.,375,,
1438,0.97,8917.842,8926.083,"And at that point, Councilmember Herbold can remove her modified amendment without that section D.",375,,
1439,0.97,8926.083,8926.617,All right.,376,,
1440,0.97,8926.617,8927.251,Thank you.,376,,
1441,0.97,8927.251,8943.334,"So Amelia, if I understand you correctly, are you saying that the only member that is allowed to make a motion to strike subsection D is the prime sponsor, which in this case would be Councilmember Herbold?",377,,
1442,0.97,8943.334,8947.271,At this point because this amendment is still not before the city council.,378,,
1443,0.97,8947.271,8953.177,It has not been moved nor has it been Seconded.,378,,
1444,0.97,8953.177,8953.444,Got it.,379,,
1445,0.97,8953.444,8953.644,Okay.,379,,
1446,0.97,8953.644,8959.317,Can I ask a question and hopefully that might also help?,380,,
1447,0.97,8959.317,8959.984,"Sure, Councilmember Sawant.",381,,
1448,0.97,8959.984,8963.054,I will take all the help I can get.,381,,
1449,0.97,8963.054,8967.058,"And if it doesn't help, my apologies in advance.",382,,
1450,0.97,8967.058,9001.025,"But is my understanding correct, Councilmember Herbold, that you are essentially withdrawing that subsection D that I was objecting to, in which case, we could take amendment three, which takes up--incorporates all of Councilmember Herbold's amendments except that one and all my technical amendments, which were on the advice of the city attorney, so is that essentially going to be agreeable for everyone?",382,,
1451,0.97,9001.025,9002.593,Councilmember Herbold?,383,,
1452,0.97,9002.593,9003.461,Thank you.,384,,
1453,0.97,9003.461,9025.416,"Unfortunately, your amendment three does not include the language lifting up the role of the OPA, Oig and CPC, so I would prefer to move forward as proposed where we move on amendment one as I propose to modify.",384,,
1454,0.97,9025.416,9027.451,Councilmember Sawant?,385,,
1455,0.97,9027.451,9028.519,That's fine with me.,386,,
1456,0.97,9028.519,9033.457,"I--correct me if I'm wrong, I have a feeling that would be a longer process.",386,,
1457,0.97,9033.457,9047.905,"Wouldn't it be shorter if we take amendment three, put that on the table and then have Councilmember Herbold move an amendment to include that language which I'm not opposed to and then have a vote on that?",386,,
1458,0.97,9047.905,9054.078,I think the process is going to be about equal length because both require an amendment to an amendment.,387,,
1459,0.97,9054.078,9060.151,"So I don't think that one is more expeditious than the other, but nice try.",387,,
1460,0.97,9060.151,9060.718,I appreciate the effort.,387,,
1461,0.97,9060.718,9078.402,"I wasn't trying to be clever, I thought there would be more durations to the other way because I thought my technical amendments are not incorporated in yours, Councilmember Herbold.",388,,
1462,0.97,9078.402,9078.702,Am I right?,388,,
1463,0.97,9078.702,9089.88,I don't know if you have additional technical amendments beyond the technical amendments that I have in mine and that you have included yours.,389,,
1464,0.97,9089.88,9090.281,Okay.,390,,
1465,0.97,9090.281,9092.483,Thank you for clarifying that.,390,,
1466,0.97,9092.483,9104.829,My understanding is that you have incorporated the technical amendments that I proposed in my original amendment one in yours.,391,,
1467,0.97,9104.829,9105.095,Yes.,392,,
1468,0.97,9105.095,9115.94,"I just clarified with my staff that the technical amendments suggested by the city attorney's office are in that latest version from you, which they are.",392,,
1469,0.97,9115.94,9119.076,All right.,393,,
1470,0.97,9119.076,9120.211,Let's take amendment one first.,393,,
1471,0.97,9120.211,9125.516,I think we have a landscape of what the different versions are.,393,,
1472,0.97,9125.516,9139.797,I appreciate the discussion and the debate here and appreciate that you all were flexible enough to hear about all three amendments as three potential rounds here before we made a formal motion.,393,,
1473,0.97,9139.797,9152.843,"And Councilmember Herbold, I do appreciate your willingness to invite striking subsection D from amendment one.",393,,
1474,0.97,9152.843,9161.552,I think that the ultimate goal here is to prevent the acquisition and the possession of these chemical weapons.,393,,
1475,0.97,9161.552,9176.433,"And I think that we will have an opportunity to, you know, have the court weigh in on the appropriateness of the policy choice that the city Council has made.",393,,
1476,0.97,9176.433,9183.307,I certainly continue to support this bill and its underlying intent as introduced by Councilmember Sawant.,393,,
1477,0.97,9183.307,9188.345,And I do believe that you do as well.,393,,
1478,0.97,9188.345,9224.782,"And I think, again, I think we will--we will be better served as a city without the language in subsection D and really do sincerely appreciate your willingness and your flexibility in considering making an amendment to your own amendment to strike that language so that we can move forward on this really important policy, and so that we can follow through on the city's obligation to submit this Council bill to the court for review by both judge Robart, the Federal monitor, and the DOJ.",393,,
1479,0.97,9224.782,9243.667,"So I think the sooner we get that clock started and get that review going, the better served we will all be, and hopefully they will agree with our strong and clear policy position that we just don't believe these weapons have a place in our Department.",393,,
1480,0.97,9243.667,9249.807,"So Councilmember Herbold, I'm going to hand it back over to you to walk us through amendment one.",393,,
1481,0.97,9249.807,9250.174,Thank you.,394,,
1482,0.97,9250.174,9279.937,"So I--I'm happy to walk us through it again, but I--in the short term, I'd just like to move to amend Council bill 119805 as presented on amendment one on the agenda excepting the language in amendment one related to new section D and restoring the old section D as in the proposed legislation.",394,,
1483,0.97,9279.937,9280.337,Okay.,395,,
1484,0.97,9280.337,9292.716,"Amelia, before I invite a second, I want to make sure that that motion was properly raised.",395,,
1485,0.97,9292.716,9311.335,I understood it it would be to reinstate the stricken subsection D language and to completely remove the subsection D language as proposed by Councilmember Herbold.,396,,
1486,0.97,9311.335,9314.338,So as reflected in amendment two.,397,,
1487,0.97,9314.338,9314.538,Okay.,397,,
1488,0.97,9314.538,9316.006,So is there a second?,397,,
1489,0.97,9316.006,9317.041,Second.,398,,
1490,0.97,9317.041,9327.685,"Okay, it's been moved and Seconded to amend amendment one as described by Councilmember Herbold.",399,,
1491,0.97,9327.685,9329.586,Is there any further discussion?,399,,
1492,0.97,9329.586,9329.787,Okay.,399,,
1493,0.97,9329.787,9339.73,"Hearing none, would the clerk please call the roll on the amendment to amendment one?",399,,
1494,0.97,9339.73,9341.432,Pedersen?,400,,
1495,0.97,9341.432,9342.032,Aye.,401,,
1496,0.97,9342.032,9342.766,Sawant?,402,,
1497,0.97,9342.766,9344.868,Aye.,403,,

1499,0.97,9345.502,9347.271,Aye.,405,,
1500,0.97,9347.271,9347.905,Herbold?,406,,
1501,0.97,9347.905,9349.973,Aye.,407,,
1502,0.97,9349.973,9351.308,Juarez?,408,,
1503,0.97,9351.308,9355.112,Aye.,409,,
1504,0.97,9355.112,9355.679,Lewis?,410,,
1505,0.97,9355.679,9356.313,Aye.,411,,
1506,0.97,9356.313,9357.581,Morales?,412,,
1507,0.97,9357.581,9357.981,Aye.,413,,
1508,0.97,9357.981,9358.449,Mosqueda?,414,,
1509,0.97,9358.449,9358.682,Aye.,415,,
1510,0.97,9358.682,9360.417,President Gonzalez?,416,,
1511,0.97,9360.417,9360.718,Aye.,417,,
1512,0.97,9360.718,9365.255,"Nine in favor, none opposed.",418,,
1513,0.97,9365.255,9367.491,Thank you so much.,419,,
1514,0.97,9367.491,9373.397,So that amendment passes and the bill is amended as described in amendment one.,419,,
1515,0.97,9373.397,9394.485,"So we now have a second amendment to consider, and I will hand it back over to, let's see--amendment two, Councilmember Herbold, is that your amendment?",419,,
1516,0.97,9394.485,9395.686,No.,419,,
1517,0.97,9395.686,9395.886,Okay.,419,,
1518,0.97,9395.886,9397.721,So amendment two is Councilmember Sawant's amendment?,419,,
1519,0.97,9397.721,9407.231,"I believe after the steps we've just taken, amendment two and three are not necessary to go through.",420,,
1520,0.97,9407.231,9407.598,Okay.,421,,
1521,0.97,9407.598,9407.798,Great.,421,,
1522,0.97,9407.798,9416.907,"Councilmember Herbold, do you have any other amendments to put forward?",421,,
1523,0.97,9416.907,9417.174,Excellent.,421,,
1524,0.97,9417.174,9426.283,"We have resolved a lot of issues in just a, I think, being able to have the conversation that we did was really helpful.",421,,
1525,0.97,9426.283,9427.985,"So thank you again, colleagues, for that.",421,,
1526,0.97,9427.985,9431.622,That exhausts our amendments on this particular bill.,421,,
1527,0.97,9431.622,9438.128,So we now have an amended bill before us.,421,,
1528,0.97,9438.128,9446.537,"And let's see here, let me get back in line on my agenda here.",421,,
1529,0.97,9446.537,9457.08,"And then Madame clerk, is there any formal language that needs to be done Besides Councilmember Sawant's language around withdrawing amendment two and three?",421,,
1530,0.97,9457.08,9461.385,I am double checking really quickly the amendment we just passed.,422,,
1531,0.97,9461.385,9463.821,And it looks like the actual subsections are numbered correctly.,422,,
1532,0.97,9463.821,9468.659,So we are good to go if you want to consider the bill as amended.,422,,
1533,0.97,9468.659,9469.126,Excellent.,423,,
1534,0.97,9469.126,9470.727,Thank you so much.,423,,
1535,0.97,9470.727,9472.095,Music to my ears.,423,,
1536,0.97,9472.095,9475.732,"So colleagues, we now have an amended bill before us.",423,,
1537,0.97,9475.732,9481.004,Now is the time where we can take further comment on the underlying bill as amended.,423,,
1538,0.97,9481.004,9486.677,"Councilmember Sawant, you will have the last word as the prime sponsor of the bill.",423,,
1539,0.97,9486.677,9496.854,Are there any other Councilmembers who would like to address the substance of the bill as amended before us?,423,,
1540,0.97,9496.854,9499.623,"Councilmember Paider seven, floor is yours.",423,,
1541,0.97,9499.623,9500.724,"Thank you, Council President.",424,,
1542,0.97,9500.724,9503.727,I wanted to thank Councilmember Sawant for introducing this bill.,424,,
1543,0.97,9503.727,9505.395,I was an early supporter of it.,424,,
1544,0.97,9505.395,9518.141,"And also wanted to thank our public safety chair, Lisa Herbold, for thinking it through from additional lenses so we could have these additional amendments.",424,,
1545,0.97,9518.141,9524.314,And thank you Council president and the city clerk for guiding us through the amendments.,424,,
1546,0.97,9524.314,9531.088,"I appreciate, I hope the public can see we're trying to be unified and work together on these serious issues.",424,,
1547,0.97,9531.088,9531.655,Thank you.,424,,
1548,0.97,9531.655,9536.86,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",425,,
1549,0.97,9536.86,9538.862,Another other comments on the bill?,425,,
1550,0.97,9538.862,9539.096,Okay.,425,,
1551,0.97,9539.096,9549.873,I also want to signal my thanks to Councilmember Sawant who quickly introduced this bill as well as the previous bill that we just looked at around Chokeholds.,425,,
1552,0.97,9549.873,9556.246,"So I just really want to thank you, Councilmember is a want, for introducing this bill.",425,,
1553,0.97,9556.246,9570.994,Many of us have made public statements before the introduction of this bill about the need to ban the use of chemical weapons that were intended for foreign wars and to address terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11.,425,,
1554,0.97,9570.994,9579.77,The fact that those types of weapons were being used domestically on our own residents is just abhorrent.,425,,
1555,0.97,9579.77,9603.393,And so I was an early supporter of trying to use the levers that were available to me as a Councilmember in the background to use the power of persuasion to stop the use of those weapons and those tactics on our people who were peacefully protesting.,425,,
1556,0.97,9603.393,9607.731,"And Unfortunately, those calls for action and for a pivot were not answered.",425,,
1557,0.97,9607.731,9652.075,"And when we had a moment, a small, brief moment, of thinking it was going to be answered, that the call was answered to stop using those chemical weapons, we saw that within approximately 24 hours, that it seemed tear gas was being used once again on peaceful protesters and within one of the densest neighborhoods, not just in the city, but the densest neighborhood in the state where we kept hearing reports from families and from other residents who weren't even protesting who were just existing on Capitol Hill who were suffering the consequences of this Nondiscriminate use of tear gas.",425,,
1558,0.97,9652.075,9653.677,So I absolutely support this legislation.,425,,
1559,0.97,9653.677,9665.589,"I look forward to submitting it to the court for further review, again, following on our model we used in 2017 when we considered the police accountability ordinance and submitted it to a court for review.",425,,
1560,0.97,9665.589,9683.807,We understand that we have an obligation to do that and know that our city attorney's office will pursue that path and hopefully we will get affirmation from the court as it relates to the policy choice that we've made here today.,425,,
1561,0.97,9683.807,9693.65,"And again, really appreciate the commitment to bringing this forward to doing it quickly because we do have a sense of urgency around making sure that this is addresses quickly.",425,,
1562,0.97,9693.65,9704.227,"Of course, we still have the issue of all of the chemical weapons that are currently owned by Seattle police Department that are in the inventory.",425,,
1563,0.97,9704.227,9711.468,The language of the bill does not necessarily require them to dispose of those--that existing inventory.,425,,
1564,0.97,9711.468,9729.686,So we will have to have a conversation about how we deal with the disposal of those items without the unintended consequence of having to send those weapons to other cities where they will be used in ways that will have negative impact and harm there as well.,425,,
1565,0.97,9729.686,9732.456,So looking forward to having that conversation.,425,,
1566,0.97,9732.456,9735.826,I did see Councilmember Mosqueda as I was talking raise her hand.,425,,
1567,0.97,9735.826,9738.095,"She's feeling inspired now, so we're excited about that.",425,,
1568,0.97,9738.095,9742.566,So I'm going to go ahead and hand it to Councilmember Mosqueda.,425,,
1569,0.97,9742.566,9751.742,"If any other Councilmembers have comments to make, please do raise your hand or shoot me a quick text message to let me know you have comments to make.",425,,
1570,0.97,9751.742,9756.346,"Again, Councilmember Sawant will have the last word on this bill.",425,,
1571,0.97,9756.346,9756.847,Councilmember Mosqueda?,425,,
1572,0.97,9756.847,9764.988,"Thank you so much Councilmember Sawant for Introdousing this bill, and Council President, you did inspire me to Chime in on a few more pieces.",426,,
1573,0.97,9764.988,9768.825,We talked a lot this morning and over the past week and a half about what we've seen.,426,,
1574,0.97,9768.825,9777.968,I want to give you a list of how I think this piece of legislation will immediately help protect the health and safety and save lives of residents throughout the city.,426,,
1575,0.97,9777.968,9785.208,This is not just coming out of a desire to De-Escalate the strategies police are using.,426,,
1576,0.97,9785.208,9795.852,"This is coming from a direct result in the last two weeks of people calling us, Emailing us, grabbing us while near the street to tell us what they've seen.",426,,
1577,0.97,9795.852,9811.735,"From the inspector general, the list of claims that we've heard are people who have experienced having a thumb amputated because of a flash bang device, a Protester who is now partially blind due to rubber bullets being used.",426,,
1578,0.97,9811.735,9821.745,We've heard stories of a woman who had to be Resuscitated after getting hit in the chest with a flash bang device.,426,,
1579,0.97,9821.745,9834.491,"We know the story repeatedly of a young boy, 7 years old, getting sprayed in the face with pepper spray and this is in addition to all of the other stories that we're hearing just about excessive force.",426,,
1580,0.97,9834.491,9846.403,"Officers kneeling on the neck of two Detainees in our area, officers punching a youth on the ground the Friday night before the main Saturday night protest.",426,,
1581,0.97,9846.403,9849.072,An officer punching a person on Saturday night.,426,,
1582,0.97,9849.072,9851.541,Failure to secure the rifles in their cars.,426,,
1583,0.97,9851.541,9854.911,These are the type of complaints that we're hearing from across the city.,426,,
1584,0.97,9854.911,9871.294,"So at least taking away these weapons of war and to the good points that were made earlier today, the weapons that have been deemed illegal in actual course of war, getting those off of our streets and having those not used against our residents is critical.",426,,
1585,0.97,9871.294,9888.845,"I thank you for putting forward this bill, and I just think it shows a strong show of solidarity across this entire Council that every single person was wanting to act quickly last week and today to move forward with this legislation.",426,,
1586,0.97,9888.845,9902.125,It was probably past due before this week and I appreciate the urgency in which it's been brought forward to respond to the calls for action from the community.,426,,
1587,0.97,9902.125,9902.425,"Thanks, all.",426,,
1588,0.97,9902.425,9902.926,Okay.,427,,
1589,0.97,9902.926,9903.56,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",427,,
1590,0.97,9903.56,9925.782,"I just want to underscore how much I appreciate the fact that all Councilmembers voted for my amendment one, particularly as it related to lifting up the role and the importance of our accountability partners.",428,,
1591,0.97,9925.782,9948.271,"Again, in 2017, under Council President Gonzalez's leadership, we voted for our accountability ordinance which gives the OPA, Oig and CPC a very, very important role in consulting with the council as it relates specifically to policies like the one we are about to vote on.",428,,
1592,0.97,9948.271,9954.678,"And the amendment that Councilmember Sawant was proposing, her version of amendment three, did not include that language.",428,,
1593,0.97,9954.678,9976.132,And I think it's really important that we as a Council not do anything to undermine the role of those bodies as we continue to have these conversations around use of force and changes to police practices.,428,,
1594,0.97,9976.132,9976.433,Thank you.,428,,
1595,0.97,9976.433,9981.071,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for those remarks.",429,,
1596,0.97,9981.071,10008.865,"I also agree that we can take a strong position on this particular policy issue while also continuing to lift up the role, the importance of the role, of the OPA, Oig and CPC in sort of--as we continue to move forward, I think it is really important for us to continue to do that.",429,,
1597,0.97,10008.865,10024.08,"We have not, to my knowledge, received recommendations from the community police Commission about needing to completely redo our Three-Legged stool around accountability system.",429,,
1598,0.97,10024.08,10034.991,"And I think they have still, at least as far as I know, still support the model that was originally proposed in 2017 through our police accountability ordinance.",429,,
1599,0.97,10034.991,10045.402,And I intend to continue to support that model until we receive different recommendations through the community police Commission.,429,,
1600,0.97,10045.402,10048.405,So thank you again for pointing that particular issue out.,429,,
1601,0.97,10048.405,10075.565,"And I do think that we have found a nice balance now where we have--are going to be able to achieve the underlying goals that Councilmember Sawant originally had while also still creating a clear Pathway and signal for the three accountability organizations to still clearly, through directive of the ordinance, have an opportunity to formulate recommendations without delaying the implementation of the underlying goals of the Council, council bill.",429,,
1602,0.97,10075.565,10081.604,"So with that being said, are there any other comments?",429,,
1603,0.97,10081.604,10083.44,"Councilmember Strauss, you have comments, please.",429,,
1604,0.97,10083.44,10084.307,I'll keep this short.,430,,
1605,0.97,10084.307,10089.646,I know I've said weapons of war have no place on our streets in Seattle and used against the residents of our community.,430,,
1606,0.97,10089.646,10097.053,I realize I've said that so many times I do need to let the record reflect here in this moment as well.,430,,
1607,0.97,10097.053,10112.836,Hearing from the veteran from North Seattle during public comment today was very important to me to hear about how weapons of war used on our--that are not even allowed to be used on our enemies on foreign soil have been used on residents here in Seattle.,430,,
1608,0.97,10112.836,10115.205,The residents in Seattle are not our enemy.,430,,
1609,0.97,10115.205,10117.607,"They're the ones we're here, duty bound, to protect.",430,,
1610,0.97,10117.607,10124.447,"As well as your words, Council President, about using these weapons in the densest neighborhood in the entire state.",430,,
1611,0.97,10124.447,10128.418,Thank you to the sponsor for bringing this bill forward as quickly as possible.,430,,
1612,0.97,10128.418,10132.288,Ad thank you everyone for your diligent work.,430,,
1613,0.97,10132.288,10133.59,"Thank you, council 39.",430,,
1614,0.97,10133.59,10135.725,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss.",431,,
1615,0.97,10135.725,10139.796,I think we have exhausted folks who want to make comments.,431,,
1616,0.97,10139.796,10141.164,Looks like we are ready.,431,,
1617,0.97,10141.164,10148.438,"So Councilmember Sawant, you want to take us home on this bill unless Councilmember Juarez, I see that you just lit up.",431,,
1618,0.97,10148.438,10150.206,Do you have comments you want to make?,431,,
1619,0.97,10150.206,10156.546,I was going to do my famous line for the love of God.,432,,
1620,0.97,10156.546,10156.88,But go ahead.,432,,
1621,0.97,10156.88,10160.884,Now you said it.,433,,
1622,0.97,10160.884,10161.651,You are on record.,433,,
1623,0.97,10161.651,10161.851,Okay.,433,,
1624,0.97,10161.851,10164.754,"Councilmember Sawant, you get the last word on this bill.",433,,
1625,0.97,10164.754,10173.329,Take us home so we can take a vote on this and get the law on the books.,433,,
1626,0.97,10173.329,10174.731,"Thank you, president Gonzalez.",434,,
1627,0.97,10174.731,10179.402,I really must congratulate everybody who has fought for this.,434,,
1628,0.97,10179.402,10197.62,"These are major victories, undoubtedly, as many have said, we have a long way to go in terms of police accountability let alone really eliminating police violence and brutality and addressing the longstanding racism and oppression in our society.",434,,
1629,0.97,10197.62,10199.789,"But still, these are major victories.",434,,
1630,0.97,10199.789,10211.768,"They're historic and the movement must celebrate its Victoryings, both this bill that's about to be voted on and the bill that we just passed on banning Chokeholds.",434,,
1631,0.97,10211.768,10212.335,I thank all Councilmembers.,434,,
1632,0.97,10212.335,10224.08,"I'm assuming this is going to be unanimous from all the comments that we've heard, and I really appreciate that we are going to have unanimous vote on this, on both these important bills.",434,,
1633,0.97,10224.08,10239.796,"I congratulate everyone who spoke in public comment and who have been speaking up in the last two days because it was through your intervention, through your getting organized that this bill that's going to be passed is now going to be a strong bill with no loopholes.",434,,
1634,0.97,10239.796,10258.648,"Needless to say, and as we have said lots of times before, passing legislation is not going to be enough, but yet, it is crucially important for the movement to hold its elected officials accountable to make sure the strongest possible legislation is Pased at all times.",434,,
1635,0.97,10258.648,10265.021,"I wanted to thank the movement, this victory belongs to you.",434,,
1636,0.97,10265.021,10269.993,"If you faced Chokeholds, chemical weapons and rubber bullets.",434,,
1637,0.97,10269.993,10290.58,"If you marched, rallied, organized, testified, if you weren't able to rally and organize but you made a phone call to an elected official, you held up a sign, you talked to a neighbor or if you did anything to stand up for the black lives matter movement and the movement of all working people against police violence, then today's victories are your victories.",434,,
1638,0.97,10290.58,10318.341,"I especially wanted to congratulate all the hundreds of young people who faced down just unbelievable, unspeakable violence right in our district, in district three on Capitol Hill, and whom it was my honor to meet and have lots of political conversations but, in fact, we were sprayed with Mace and tear gas when we were in the middle of exciting political conversations.",434,,
1639,0.97,10318.341,10320.476,I wanted to thank many of them.,434,,
1640,0.97,10320.476,10323.846,Obviously I can't name all of them.,434,,
1641,0.97,10323.846,10329.052,"But I wanted to specifically thank Teal Sean Turner, a member of neighbors 242.",434,,
1642,0.97,10329.052,10332.055,She's been a union member.,434,,
1643,0.97,10332.055,10338.428,"I want to thank Payton, Justin Spears, Joey wiser, who's been documenting the struggle for days.",434,,
1644,0.97,10338.428,10342.565,"This victory belongs to everybody who was there on Capitol Hill, everybody who's been marching.",434,,
1645,0.97,10342.565,10361.15,"And especially wanted to make a mention of all the families and friends who have lost their loved ones because of police murder like the family of Charleena Lyles, the family of John T. Williams, and indeed, there are too many because at least 30 black and Brown people have been murdered by Seattle police since 2011.",434,,
1646,0.97,10361.15,10365.288,"And I've read their names before, but I won't be able to read them now.",434,,
1647,0.97,10365.288,10375.264,But this victory belongs to the families of all of those community members whose lives were lost at the hands of the police.,434,,
1648,0.97,10375.264,10384.207,I completely agree with the Councilmembers who said that we do have to discuss the disposal of the weapons that are in the hands of Seattle police right now.,434,,
1649,0.97,10384.207,10396.018,"We absolutely do not want them to sell them to another jurisdiction, whether it's another city, another state or another country because this is about International solidarity against police violence and racism.",434,,
1650,0.97,10396.018,10399.088,"So absolutely, we will not let that happen.",434,,
1651,0.97,10399.088,10403.526,We do need to figure out what happens to that.,434,,
1652,0.97,10403.526,10410.6,"And I welcome, if they know if there's any socially constructive use at all for those weapons, we should direct it there.",434,,
1653,0.97,10410.6,10414.137,I welcome your input to my office.,434,,
1654,0.97,10414.137,10426.916,"In terms of next steps, I think it's important that just like we had a strong showing of the community today at the meeting for these two bills, let's hope that we have a strong showing for the budget Committee on Wednesday.",434,,
1655,0.97,10426.916,10431.454,There's going to be a public comment sign up that opens at 8:00 A.M.,434,,
1656,0.97,10431.454,10433.856,The committee meeting will start at 10:00 A.M.,434,,
1657,0.97,10433.856,10440.83,"As you know, you can easily find out how to sign up.",434,,
1658,0.97,10440.83,10444.167,Just go to Seattle city council public comment and you'll find the sheet.,434,,
1659,0.97,10444.167,10447.069,You'll have to sign up at 8:00 A.M.,434,,
1660,0.97,10447.069,10448.204,"On Wednesday, June 17th.",434,,
1661,0.97,10448.204,10450.44,There are important tasks ahead of us.,434,,
1662,0.97,10450.44,10464.153,We need to Defund Seattle police by at least 50% and make sure that this city is not controlled by police oppression but by community organizers and through social justice and restorative justice.,434,,
1663,0.97,10464.153,10487.743,"And we are discussing the tax Amazon legislation to tax big businesses in order to fund a major expansion of social housing to address homelessness, to fund programs and most importantly to fund jobs that will be, Union jobs, good paying Union jobs, with priority hire programs to address the inequities faced by our marginalized communities.",434,,
1664,0.97,10487.743,10519.876,"Another next step I wanted to mention is on the same day, Wednesday, June 17th, at 4:30 p.m., at Cal Anderson mark, I hope everyone fighting in the black lives matter movement will join us because there's a rally being organized by the rank and file of Seattle's labor movement, and they will be demanding that the local labor movement leaders, the labor Council, the King County labor Council, remove the Seattle police officers Guild out of labor Council.",434,,
1665,0.97,10519.876,10532.121,"And so this is the rally that will get Seattle police out of our labor Council, because this is our labor movement and there's no room in our labor movement for police brutality because an injury to one is an injury to all.",434,,
1666,0.97,10532.121,10535.958,So please join us in public comment sign up on 8:00 A.M.,434,,
1667,0.97,10535.958,10536.259,June 17th.,434,,
1668,0.97,10536.259,10545.701,"And join us on the same day, Wednesday, June 17th, at Cal Anderson park at 4:30 for a rally alongside the rank and file of the labor movement.",434,,
1669,0.97,10545.701,10551.407,"Last but not least, I'll say that all of this is extremely important and it's historic, but it's also minimal.",434,,
1670,0.97,10551.407,10573.763,"So we need to go forward in making the real kind of change we need to do to Defund the police by 50% to raise progressive revenues by taxing big business to fund housing and most immediately we need to make sure that those who have been arrested in the protest movement, in the peaceful protest movement, should be released and no changes filed against them.",434,,
1671,0.97,10573.763,10578.067,I hope all Councilmembers will support these next steps.,434,,
1672,0.97,10578.067,10578.334,Thank you.,434,,
1673,0.97,10578.334,10579.669,Thank you Councilmember is a want.,435,,
1674,0.97,10579.669,10586.008,So I think I'm going to go ahead and close out debate so that we can go ahead and call the roll on this bill.,435,,
1675,0.97,10586.008,10598.721,So I am now going to ask that the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill as amended.,435,,

1697,0.97,10634.223,10640.896,I think that both agenda items two and three and now four all are contributing to a better Ecosystem here.,455,,
1698,0.97,10640.896,10647.903,"And of course, we have a lot more to do, but this is a good place for us to start.",455,,
1699,0.97,10647.903,10648.504,"So congratulations, everyone.",455,,
1700,0.97,10648.504,10656.679,Will the clerk please read into the record agenda item four?,455,,
1701,0.97,10656.679,10658.28,Agenda item four.,456,,
1702,0.97,10658.28,10677.099,"Council bill 119803 requiring that certain uniformed peace officers do not cover with a mourning band, the serial number that is engraved on their badge.",456,,
1703,0.97,10677.099,10682.471,"Thank you Madame clerk, Ly move to pass Council bill 11980 #.",457,,
1704,0.97,10682.471,10682.905,Is there a second?,457,,
1705,0.97,10682.905,10683.172,Second.,458,,
1706,0.97,10683.172,10686.008,It's been moved and Seconded to pass the bill.,459,,
1707,0.97,10686.008,10692.815,"Councilmember Herbold, you are the prime sponsor of this bill, so I am going to recognize you in order to address this item.",459,,
1708,0.97,10692.815,10694.55,Thank you so much.,460,,
1709,0.97,10694.55,10711.033,"So today we're voting on Council bill 119803, which will require officers to display their badge numbers while allowing mourning bands to observe the death of officers on a different part of the badge.",460,,
1710,0.97,10711.033,10724.78,"Many, many constituents have contacted the Council alarmed that badge numbers were not visible in the two weeks following the murder of George Floyd.",460,,
1711,0.97,10724.78,10735.791,"After I announced I was drafting legislation, chief best issued a directive to all officers to display their badge numbers while wearing mourning bands.",460,,
1712,0.97,10735.791,10747.002,"I, of course, appreciate that order but believe that this policy must be adopted into state city law.",460,,
1713,0.97,10747.002,10761.417,"The legislation AMENDS section 3.28130 of the Seattle municipal code, which was created after the 1999 WTO protests when people noted, at that time, that they could not view the name tags of officers.",460,,
1714,0.97,10761.417,10770.793,So then former city council member Peter Steinbrook sponsored legislation to create a new section of the municipal code to require display of name tag.,460,,
1715,0.97,10770.793,10781.403,"This legislation is emergency legislation, so it will go into effect immediately upon signature of the Mayor within the next ten days.",460,,
1716,0.97,10781.403,10786.509,It would not have the additional 30-day waiting period for Nonemergency legislation.,460,,
1717,0.97,10786.509,10824.847,"The bill also requests that the Seattle police Department work with all other law enforcement agencies whose peace officers reasonably may be anticipated to enforce traffic or criminal laws in Seattle pursuant to chapter 10.--Rcw to develop a policy that would require these peace officers when enforcing these laws to conform with requirements concerning badges, identification devices, departmental identification on uniforms and oral identification that is consistent with Seattle municipal code section 3.28.130.",460,,
1718,0.97,10824.847,10835.891,The Seattle police Department is requesting--Seattle city council with a proposal for the policy by January 2021.,460,,
1719,0.97,10835.891,10836.325,Thank you.,460,,
1720,0.97,10836.325,10844.633,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for that description and for introducing this important bill.",461,,
1721,0.97,10844.633,10850.005,Are there any comments or questions on this bill?,461,,
1722,0.97,10850.005,10850.573,Okay.,461,,
1723,0.97,10850.573,10851.807,I'm not hearing or seeing any.,461,,
1724,0.97,10851.807,10884.406,"Again, I want to thank you, Councilmember Herbold, I think we have all discussed this bill quite a bit before today and do agree with the approach that you've described, which is about not just allowing this kind of policy to exist at the discretion of Whomever might be the chief but to actually make sure that this is made concrete and long lasting through the legislation.",461,,
1725,0.97,10884.406,10908.597,"Of course, a future Council could disagree with our policy position and change that, but I think it's pretty clear that this Council agrees very strongly that this should be the policy and that it should be Cotfied in law and not just exist in a P manual.",461,,
1726,0.97,10908.597,10911.6,I appreciate you bringing this for █Our consideration.,461,,
1727,0.97,10911.6,10916.005,"Councilmember Mosqueda, I see you've raised your hand.",461,,
1728,0.97,10916.005,10916.238,Please.,461,,
1729,0.97,10916.238,10917.106,Thank you very much.,462,,
1730,0.97,10917.106,10919.441,"Councilmember Herbold, thank you for bringing forth this legislation.",462,,
1731,0.97,10919.441,10924.046,I wanted to ask you a question both as the sponsor of this legislation and as chair of public safety.,462,,
1732,0.97,10924.046,10933.255,"We know that even after the chief issued that directive, we heard reports of individuals who are still covering badge numbers.",462,,
1733,0.97,10933.255,10941.43,Can you remind folks what to do if they see that happen after this ordinance has passed and what the process should be?,462,,
1734,0.97,10941.43,10949.204,"It would be a violation of SPD, both SPD policy and city law.",463,,
1735,0.97,10949.204,10960.049,The Office of professional accountability has a complainant process to investigate complaints of violation of city policy.,463,,
1736,0.97,10960.049,10972.594,And there's also the ability of an investigation of the violation of city law to go along the investigation of a violation of city policy.,463,,
1737,0.97,10972.594,10978.834,I do want to note that badge numbers are in different places on different people's badges.,463,,
1738,0.97,10978.834,10983.672,Sometimes they're in the center and sometimes they're at the bottom.,463,,
1739,0.97,10983.672,10995.617,And I know that some of the examples of covered badge numbers that I saw after chief best's order had the tape through the middle.,463,,
1740,0.97,10995.617,11001.256,"And there was actually a badge number at the bottom of the badge, in some instances.",463,,
1741,0.97,11001.256,11006.295,"I, of course, have not seen every example of every complaint.",463,,
1742,0.97,11006.295,11023.245,There are--they--this issue is one of the sort of the top ten issues that the office of professional accountability is looking at as it relates to the volume of complaints they've received.,463,,

1768,0.97,11066.422,11074.096,And I'd ask that the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation.,484,,

1775,0.97,11100.088,11109.131,It's a great honor that I get to bring a proclamation today honoring Thomas whit mor for his service to the city of Seattle.,485,,
1776,0.97,11109.131,11115.904,"I have known Thomas for a very long time, from the time I served on the Ballard District Council and throughout the neighborhood.",485,,
1777,0.97,11115.904,11121.176,I've always found him to be an exceptional public servant and steward of our city.,485,,
1778,0.97,11121.176,11127.282,So it's a loss for our city family to lose him.,485,,
