66,0.97,353.086,370.87,"It's disappointing to not see updating the tree ordinance as a priority in 2021 in their presentation which was put on the Website it is not surprising, however, considering Sdci's history on tree protection.",12,,

68,0.97,374.407,385.818,It's time to end this repeated delay by Sdci in presenting the Seattle city council with an updated Ordnance.,12,,

76,0.97,434.233,449.949,Years of inaction in our urban forests demands that a separate entity take over the city's responsibility to protect and enhance our urban forest.,12,,
77,0.97,449.949,454.487,Trees need an advocate to represent them.,12,,

156,0.97,890.089,892.091,And then Secondly it was nice to hear from yonder.,22,,
157,0.97,892.091,895.494,I heard that was the driving force behind this.,22,,
158,0.97,895.494,905.337,I was past president of the green Lake neighborhood community Council back in the 90S.,22,,
159,0.97,905.337,905.938,Long time ago.,22,,
160,0.97,905.938,910.643,Since then haven't been much.,22,,

165,0.97,927.359,927.76,Interests.,22,,
166,0.97,927.76,934.066,There's an obvious advantage for starting up a home business on a residential street.,22,,
167,0.97,934.066,935.934,The rent is significantly cheaper.,22,,
168,0.97,935.934,937.937,And there's no permitting required.,22,,
169,0.97,937.937,941.273,And there's also free parking for customers.,22,,
170,0.97,941.273,948.414,"The yonder was probably a very good, well loved business however that's not the case with all.",22,,
171,0.97,948.414,960.292,"And just in it all deference to our commercial districts, we love our little shops and it's especially in this time we need to support local businesses and local business districts.",22,,
172,0.97,960.292,965.998,The current legislation was Crafted with compromise between the different stake holder groups.,22,,
173,0.97,965.998,980.179,One of which was to not have large signs advertising in neighborhoods we somewhat despise.,22,,
174,0.97,980.179,986.318,Current legislation allows a one foot wide sign with five inch letters.,22,,
175,0.97,986.318,992.658,This proposal would be an eight foot wide sign with seven and a half inch tall letters.,22,,
176,0.97,992.658,998.03,"Secondly, the current legislation very carefully Crafted language about parking impacts.",22,,
177,0.97,998.03,1001.066,It said that there shall not be significant.,22,,

186,0.97,1047.679,1048.08,"Well, colleagues.",25,,
187,0.97,1048.08,1056.555,Seeing as we have no additional speakers we will move on to the next agenda item.,25,,

190,0.97,1069.401,1072.204,Council bill 12 0001.,26,,
191,0.97,1072.204,1076.208,Ordinance relating to land use Registrationlation of home occupations.,26,,
192,0.97,1076.208,1082.614,Adopting interim regulations to allow home occupation businesses to operate with fewer limitations during the Covid-19 civil emergency.,26,,
193,0.97,1082.614,1082.981,Thank you.,27,,
194,0.97,1082.981,1091.924,"I was very, I'm very glad to bring there legislation forward with Council President Gonzalez and Mosqueda.",27,,
195,0.97,1091.924,1096.695,We have Council President Gonzalez has joined us as a guest on the committee.,27,,
196,0.97,1096.695,1104.903,"This is a, we need to make sure our land use code is able to respond to the crisis facing small businesses as a result of Covid-19.",27,,
197,0.97,1104.903,1118.217,"This legislation recognizes that our code has not kept up with business owners, creativity and drive as we have learned this past year our streets and neighborhoods can create communities in ways we might not have imagined before the pandemic.",27,,
198,0.97,1118.217,1123.622,"Healthy streets have allowed us to walk, ride and roll in a safe and healthy way.",27,,
199,0.97,1123.622,1140.639,We've seen examples of that in my own neighborhood of home occupancy businesses that I'm not going to Tattle on today who are operating outside of the letter of the code and this would help them make sure that they have a level playing field and able to stay open.,27,,
200,0.97,1140.639,1151.817,We also saw this as yonder cider was able to reopen because inspectors are only able to enforce and operate within the code that we have written.,27,,
201,0.97,1151.817,1154.553,And this legislation is more than just about yonder.,27,,
202,0.97,1154.553,1161.894,I hope that we're able to pass this today and we.,27,,
203,0.97,1161.894,1165.531,Also will be bringing an amendment forward that was circulated last night.,27,,
204,0.97,1165.531,1175.674,Welcome and if you'd like to give us a brief overview and a refresher.,27,,
205,0.97,1175.674,1175.941,Sure.,28,,
206,0.97,1175.941,1179.545,Thank you.,28,,

208,0.97,1179.912,1182.814,Council central staff.,28,,
209,0.97,1182.814,1183.815,As Councilmember Strauss mentioned.,28,,
210,0.97,1183.815,1189.188,Would amend the land use code to temporarily Mod if few regulations for home occupations.,28,,
211,0.97,1189.188,1204.77,"Materials you have attached to the agenda include a presentation from the last meeting, a memo from me that highlights current regulations and provides a brief survey of how other jurisdictions regulate home occupations.",28,,
212,0.97,1204.77,1208.44,As Councilmember Strauss mentioned there was an amendment circulated yesterday.,28,,
213,0.97,1208.44,1221.92,I'll provide a brief refresher on what Council bill 120001 would do and then unless there are questions we can move on to the proposed amendment.,28,,
214,0.97,1221.92,1224.423,So what would CB 120001 do?,29,,
215,0.97,1224.423,1239.004,On an interim basis up to one year it would remove the limitations on regulations that limit the number of customer visits to a home occupation on the number of employees a home occupation can have.,29,,
216,0.97,1239.004,1249.514,Limitations on increased traffic and parking demand due to home occupation including use of a code required parking space on private property for a Home-Based business.,29,,
217,0.97,1249.514,1258.857,It would also change limitations on the Noncommercial appearance of home occupations including dispensation for larger signs while the ordinance is in effect.,29,,
218,0.97,1258.857,1268.8,The Council members have any questions about what Council bill 120001 would do?,29,,
219,0.97,1268.8,1269.167,Colleagues?,30,,
220,0.97,1269.167,1269.534,Any questions?,30,,
221,0.97,1269.534,1290.689,For the viewing public if it you go to our Legistar on can see the presentation that Ketil provided and you can go back and watch I believe it was the February 24th committee meeting to watch the tape from there.,30,,
222,0.97,1290.689,1294.926,We had robust discussion and great questions.,30,,
223,0.97,1294.926,1296.828,Any questions at this time?,30,,
224,0.97,1296.828,1297.329,Seeing no questions.,30,,
225,0.97,1297.329,1310.442,"I do want to once again raise the fact that this, any business that is operating under home occupancy rules is regulated by any governmental entity that touches that business.",30,,
226,0.97,1310.442,1315.48,"So if they have a commercial kitchen, Department of health.",30,,
227,0.97,1315.48,1325.824,If they're serving beer liquor control board.,30,,
228,0.97,1325.824,1334.299,They have to register with Fsa understanding that all of that said this doesn't change any code.,30,,
229,0.97,1334.299,1335.067,Any zoning.,30,,
230,0.97,1335.067,1335.667,This simply changes code.,30,,
231,0.97,1335.667,1343.909,Interim basis for one year with a work plan to understand what would be considered for a permanent change.,30,,
232,0.97,1343.909,1346.178,I do have a question.,31,,
233,0.97,1346.178,1346.545,I'm sorry.,32,,
234,0.97,1346.545,1348.947,I was trying to catch up.,32,,
235,0.97,1348.947,1350.982,"First of all, thank you, Mr.",32,,
236,0.97,1350.982,1353.552,Chair for the information.,32,,
237,0.97,1353.552,1354.252,And thank you Ketil.,32,,
238,0.97,1354.252,1356.288,We didn't have your memo on February 24th.,32,,
239,0.97,1356.288,1359.091,Thank you for the memo that we now have in front of us.,32,,
240,0.97,1359.091,1366.998,I don't know if we want to address this now or talk about as we get into after your amendments and then we speak to a bill as a whole.,32,,
241,0.97,1366.998,1375.14,The question that I had which we did not talk about on February 24th when we wanted to clarify what interim meant.,32,,
242,0.97,1375.14,1380.746,Some of the interim stuff we've done with Sdci and it's always meant a year.,32,,
243,0.97,1380.746,1382.914,What's new now in this memo.,32,,
244,0.97,1382.914,1385.517,I'm trying to decide how I'm going to vote on this.,32,,
245,0.97,1385.517,1394.426,"I'm not comfortable with, but I want to hear what other people have to say when we get closer, exploring the Permanency of this.",32,,
246,0.97,1394.426,1396.528,My understanding is that it's for one year.,32,,
247,0.97,1396.528,1408.507,I'm concerned about the Permanency in had light of what we already put on Sdci and I have some concerns because we already have a law that allows home businesses.,32,,
248,0.97,1408.507,1413.278,I'm curious and excited to see if this does pass what one year does.,32,,
249,0.97,1413.278,1420.519,"I don't know if you should slap the pandemic in front of everything now, every piece of legislation is because of the pandemic we want this.",32,,
250,0.97,1420.519,1423.188,I don't know if this fits in that box yet.,32,,
251,0.97,1423.188,1425.19,I'm open to hearing what other people have to say.,32,,
252,0.97,1425.19,1432.798,Is that something we should address now about the Permanency and the by-products or unintended consequences to existing local businesses?,32,,
253,0.97,1432.798,1443.775,Or do you want to wait until we get further down the road when we start talking about the closer to our comments on the bill as amended.,32,,
254,0.97,1443.775,1444.309,Good questions.,33,,
255,0.97,1444.309,1449.047,Let's move this amendment and speak to the whole bill entirely.,33,,
256,0.97,1449.047,1449.915,Because those are important questions.,33,,
257,0.97,1449.915,1454.853,And your amendment is more of a technical one?,34,,
258,0.97,1454.853,1455.253,That's right.,35,,
259,0.97,1455.253,1465.997,Technical amendment as well as I was hoping maybe it wouldn't work but you said last time you couldn't support the bill as written so I wanted to make at least one change.,35,,
260,0.97,1465.997,1469.234,Change the bill to the Fry bread bill if things go right.,36,,
261,0.97,1469.234,1474.873,I'll rename it that.,37,,
262,0.97,1474.873,1475.173,Absolutely.,37,,
263,0.97,1475.173,1476.374,"Thank you, chairman.",38,,
264,0.97,1476.374,1480.912,"Thank you, council member Juarez.",39,,
265,0.97,1480.912,1484.115,So amendment 1 we have one amendment to consider.,39,,
266,0.97,1484.115,1487.519,This would change the language around parking to clarify its intent.,39,,
267,0.97,1487.519,1507.405,We had one sentence doing a lot of work and the language proposed here is more clear and leaves less room for differences of interpretation as well as it would make clear that this legislation allows a Home-Based business to operate in a home's required parking stall or garage.,39,,
268,0.97,1507.405,1530.362,I think we go back to the fact that so many entrepreneurs use their garage to turn their dreams into reality and this amendment makes clear that once this legislation expires or the business is no longer using that space the home is still required to meet the minimum parking standards.,39,,
269,0.97,1530.362,1540.639,We're ensuring that you're not able to continue using your parking garage past the life of this bill.,39,,
270,0.97,1540.639,1558.99,I'm not sure if the amendment is on the agenda so I can share my screen for those folks in the public.,40,,
271,0.97,1558.99,1564.696,So this is the amendment proposed by Councilmember Strauss.,40,,
272,0.97,1564.696,1575.006,Clarify home occupation may occupy a required parking space without limitations on structural changes that may be made to that parking space for the purposes of the home occupation while the ordinance is in effect.,40,,
273,0.97,1575.006,1581.346,And then it also has some language in here that clarifies what happens when the ordinance is no longer in effect.,40,,
274,0.97,1581.346,1593.325,This would clarify that after the ordinance is no longer in effect unless it's extended by some future action by the Council any changes that the property essentially has to be returned to its previous condition.,40,,
275,0.97,1593.325,1605.17,"If it somebody has modified their garage, for example in a way that would make that garage Nonconforming for the purposes of the land use code they have to remove that modification when the ordinance is no longer in effect.",40,,
276,0.97,1605.17,1614.145,If a property was previously Nonconforming with respect to some element of the land use code it can be returned to the previous condition.,40,,
277,0.97,1614.145,1616.348,That's the second clarification in the amendment.,40,,
278,0.97,1616.348,1626.591,This would apply to other changes that might be made for the purposes of establishing a home occupation or expanding a home occupation under this bill.,40,,
279,0.97,1626.591,1628.293,For instance a sign.,40,,
280,0.97,1628.293,1640.972,If somebody puts a larger sign up under the authority of this bill they would have to remove that larger sign once the bill is no longer in effect.,40,,
281,0.97,1640.972,1644.142,Thank you.,41,,
282,0.97,1644.142,1645.21,I see Councilmember Pedersen.,41,,
283,0.97,1645.21,1646.644,"All colleagues, any questions?",41,,
284,0.97,1646.644,1647.078,This is the time.,41,,
285,0.97,1647.078,1650.849,This is a question about the amendment.,42,,
286,0.97,1650.849,1665.397,Ketil in the first part of the amendment as I understand it this is a temporary measure but the word temporarily is removed.,42,,
287,0.97,1665.397,1666.398,Can you help me?,42,,
288,0.97,1666.398,1667.799,That's for the purposes.,43,,
289,0.97,1667.799,1669.467,Thank you for that question.,43,,
290,0.97,1669.467,1679.177,That's to clarify sort of what the standard is here for home occupation that might be established or expanded under this ordinance.,43,,
291,0.97,1679.177,1694.225,"That's to clarify if somebody is occupying a portion of their garage for the purposes of the home occupation that that can, they don't have to remove any changes they made to their garage while the ordinance is in effect.",43,,
292,0.97,1694.225,1701.8,"So on a daily basis they don't have to make changes, they don't have to sort of return the garage to its conforming condition.",43,,
293,0.97,1701.8,1705.47,They can keep it up for the entire duration of the ordinance.,43,,
294,0.97,1705.47,1710.075,Does that make sense?,43,,
295,0.97,1710.075,1710.642,Yes.,44,,
296,0.97,1710.642,1710.975,Thank you.,44,,
297,0.97,1710.975,1713.912,"Further more, this, it wasn't clear.",45,,
298,0.97,1713.912,1721.92,The temporary was to also demonstrate at the end of this bill at the end of the life of this bill that it would have to be removed.,45,,
299,0.97,1721.92,1725.056,That also wasn't as clear.,45,,
300,0.97,1725.056,1735.467,This amendment clarifies both points.,45,,
301,0.97,1735.467,1738.036,"Colleagues, other questions?",46,,
302,0.97,1738.036,1746.578,Seeing none I will move that the committee adopt amendment 1 to Council bill 120001.,46,,
303,0.97,1746.578,1747.145,Second.,47,,
304,0.97,1747.145,1751.649,It has been moved and Seconded.,48,,
305,0.97,1751.649,1763.394,To amend the legislation as shown in amendment 1. if there are no additional comments will the clerk please call the roll.,48,,
306,0.97,1763.394,1763.995,Councilmember Pedersen.,49,,
307,0.97,1763.995,1765.797,Yes.,50,,
308,0.97,1765.797,1767.632,Councilmember Lewis.,51,,
309,0.97,1767.632,1770.735,It yes.,52,,
310,0.97,1770.735,1772.203,Councilmember Juarez.,53,,
311,0.97,1772.203,1773.338,Aye.,54,,
312,0.97,1773.338,1776.04,Councilmember Mosqueda.,55,,
313,0.97,1776.04,1776.608,Aye.,56,,
314,0.97,1776.608,1779.01,The motion carries.,57,,
315,0.97,1779.01,1793.791,And this is now the time Councilmember Juarez to return to some of these longer and we have Council President Gonzalez who is also co-sponsor so I'll give her a moment to speak in a second.,57,,
316,0.97,1793.791,1807.939,"I do want to, unless Councilmember Juarez you'd like Council President to go first.",57,,
317,0.97,1807.939,1810.842,Thank you finish the good meeting we had time.,58,,
318,0.97,1810.842,1812.277,"Thank you, Ketil, like I said.",58,,
319,0.97,1812.277,1824.088,I did bring up the issue about the Permanency and what my concerns would be and I have the same concerns with as some of the changes we've learned of.,58,,
320,0.97,1824.088,1827.392,I have concerns about the parking impacts.,58,,
321,0.97,1827.392,1832.23,I know that--and I also still have concerns about having.,58,,
322,0.97,1832.23,1835.967,We have a law that allows people to have home businesses.,58,,
323,0.97,1835.967,1846.01,"I understand the expansion and why you want to do that and, you know, making it easier to have these type of businesses.",58,,
324,0.97,1846.01,1852.317,What I'm hearing from and what I have concerns about and I don't know if Sdci is the place.,58,,
325,0.97,1852.317,1853.785,We need more information.,58,,
326,0.97,1853.785,1858.423,The competition with existing already struggling small businesses.,58,,
327,0.97,1858.423,1862.46,Small businesses that comply with the four areas where we would be relaxing.,58,,
328,0.97,1862.46,1866.064,They still have to comply with parking.,58,,
329,0.97,1866.064,1866.798,With Ada.,58,,
330,0.97,1866.798,1868.266,With number of employees.,58,,
331,0.97,1868.266,1868.633,With Signage.,58,,
332,0.97,1868.633,1869.934,I think I brought this analogy.,58,,
333,0.97,1869.934,1872.804,I wanted to bring it to its logical conclusion.,58,,
334,0.97,1872.804,1881.88,If you're selling something out of your garage driveway and four blocks away I don't want to be competing with coffee clutch.,58,,
335,0.97,1881.88,1884.182,I have and these places with neighborhoods.,58,,
336,0.97,1884.182,1887.719,"I know your neighborhood has more sidewalks than D 5, that's for sure.",58,,
337,0.97,1887.719,1893.758,Parking is not a real big issue on kind of where we're at here with the sidewalks.,58,,
338,0.97,1893.758,1900.531,"But the small business pieces because we have so many small business along Lake City, Aurora, 125th, North gate.",58,,
339,0.97,1900.531,1905.036,So that is the concern I was hearing.,58,,
340,0.97,1905.036,1914.445,I don't know Sdci's equipped to do the type of analysis to say where we're going to be and what the impacts are to existing businesses.,58,,
341,0.97,1914.445,1925.356,Also our encouragement to start using calling restaurants directly in picking up and not using third party carriers so that all the money goes to that existing small business restaurant.,58,,
342,0.97,1925.356,1930.695,"Not 15% to, you know, the delivery service.",58,,
343,0.97,1930.695,1943.675,"I'm going to let you speak to some of the concerns about what they're already doing and how this makes it any, this adds on to that if they can do that.",58,,
344,0.97,1943.675,1948.613,I don't have a problem with the idea.,58,,
345,0.97,1948.613,1953.584,I understand we want small businesses and a lot of small businesses started out of their gram.,58,,
346,0.97,1953.584,1957.588,People can still start businesses out of their garage.,58,,
347,0.97,1957.588,1961.893,I'm concerned about the areas where we're relaxing and its impact to already existing small businesses.,58,,
348,0.97,1961.893,1965.463,And the unfair competition it may or may not create.,58,,
349,0.97,1965.463,1973.671,So that's where all my concerns were and I think some of them we addressed at the last hearing and so that's why I was glad to get Ketil's memo this time.,58,,
350,0.97,1973.671,1976.808,I'll leave it at that.,58,,
351,0.97,1976.808,1977.108,Thank you.,58,,
352,0.97,1977.108,1977.775,Thank you.,59,,
353,0.97,1977.775,1983.948,I took some notes on I was meeting with the Phinney neighborhood Association yesterday.,59,,
354,0.97,1983.948,1990.455,They're kind of like the Chamber of Commerce for Phinney Greenwood.,59,,
355,0.97,1990.455,1991.723,They do social services.,59,,
356,0.97,1991.723,1992.824,They're just an amazing organization.,59,,
357,0.97,1992.824,2003.735,They were really supportive of making sure that yonder was able to stay open and Yonders' only about a block or two off their official business district.,59,,
358,0.97,2003.735,2004.902,Right in their own backyard.,59,,
359,0.97,2004.902,2008.039,They've got the support of their local business district.,59,,
360,0.97,2008.039,2011.776,And then I wanted to talk about the Permanency.,59,,
361,0.97,2011.776,2025.79,The reason that we have a work plan for the Pathway to Permanency within the bill is so many times of late we've heard critics of our work here saying you didn't give us enough time to engage.,59,,
362,0.97,2025.79,2028.359,Or we didn't know how to engage.,59,,
363,0.97,2028.359,2039.937,"So rather than have a scatter shot approach to understanding what is working well, what didn't work, did we include something that shouldn't have been.",59,,
364,0.97,2039.937,2047.078,That's why it was important for us to create that work plan from go.,59,,
365,0.97,2047.078,2049.914,"Regarding parking, gray, go for it.",59,,
366,0.97,2049.914,2051.783,I'm finished.,60,,
367,0.97,2051.783,2054.619,"Sorry, go ahead.",60,,
368,0.97,2054.619,2055.586,I'm taking notes.,60,,
369,0.97,2055.586,2055.887,Go ahead.,60,,
370,0.97,2055.887,2056.387,Regarding parking.,61,,
371,0.97,2056.387,2062.427,Many different areas of our city have different parking impacts.,61,,
372,0.97,2062.427,2074.705,"And so as well as, it's always, it's never exactly clear what different variable in the area is increasing parking.",61,,
373,0.97,2074.705,2075.339,Increasing demand on parking.,61,,
374,0.97,2075.339,2080.211,We've got people who live in homes using it.,61,,
375,0.97,2080.211,2085.116,In yonder's case they are a block or two off the business district.,61,,
376,0.97,2085.116,2094.625,So is parking increasing because people are shopping at yonder or is it because they're shopping in the business district?,61,,
377,0.97,2094.625,2102.066,That's why it's important to create clarity.,61,,
378,0.97,2102.066,2106.304,"That's what, Councilmember Juarez, did you want to share other thoughts?",61,,
379,0.97,2106.304,2124.121,The other thing is I really like this idea because I think what we're creating here by using garages and driveways and I don't think you've used the word when you talk about pathways to Perm Yensy.,62,,
380,0.97,2124.121,2125.923,You're creating mini Incubators for businesses.,62,,
381,0.97,2125.923,2126.424,That's a great thing.,62,,
382,0.97,2126.424,2131.496,I don't think you need a Recession-Fueled pandemic to do this.,62,,
383,0.97,2131.496,2132.23,We could do it anyway.,62,,
384,0.97,2132.23,2136.601,And we should do it and encourage it.,62,,
385,0.97,2136.601,2150.248,"Again, my main focus is what its impact is to third party, impact to small businesses that are already struggling and creating an unfair advantage because they are struggling from the pandemic.",62,,
386,0.97,2150.248,2160.358,"My idea when we have legislation that's based because we're in the middle of a recession and pandemic is because it's a, directly impacted by that.",62,,
387,0.97,2160.358,2165.963,"Whether it's the moratorium renting, housing, all the things we've done.",62,,
388,0.97,2165.963,2170.468,We could have done this in a Nonpandemic era.,62,,
389,0.97,2170.468,2178.309,It is innovative in that sense that you you want to give people the opportunity.,62,,
390,0.97,2178.309,2180.111,They've now had a permanent space.,62,,
391,0.97,2180.111,2184.515,"If they move from garage to a store front and to a small business, it's great.",62,,
392,0.97,2184.515,2186.484,It makes sense.,62,,
393,0.97,2186.484,2189.921,That makes sense to me.,62,,
394,0.97,2189.921,2192.456,Thank you.,62,,
395,0.97,2192.456,2194.559,That's exactly right.,63,,
396,0.97,2194.559,2203.267,"And this, these code restrictions were actually creating an Unlevel playing field for some of these home occupancy businesses that have been operating for years.",63,,
397,0.97,2203.267,2214.679,"It wasn't until yonder had received this complaint that I, it opened my eyes to seeing how so many different businesses are operating outside of the letter of the code.",63,,
398,0.97,2214.679,2220.851,That's why it's important for the ones that were existing before the pandemic to create that level playing field.,63,,
399,0.97,2220.851,2223.454,I don't want to Tattle on them today.,63,,
400,0.97,2223.454,2235.566,"To be fair when we do live in D 5, I know of a half a dozen businesses that operate out of their homes that I don't want to Tattle on that make pies and deliver them.",64,,
401,0.97,2235.566,2243.641,"And do other things and deliver them to certain restaurants and it's just, I get it.",64,,
402,0.97,2243.641,2248.246,You want to Legitimize that.,64,,
403,0.97,2248.246,2249.747,You want small business incubation.,64,,
404,0.97,2249.747,2250.881,I want that year.,64,,
405,0.97,2250.881,2252.316,I want to see what happens.,64,,
406,0.97,2252.316,2262.293,You see where my concern is when I have constituents who are struggling as small businesses because of this Pandemic-Fueled recession.,64,,
407,0.97,2262.293,2264.962,I'll leave it at that and let other people speak.,64,,
408,0.97,2264.962,2269.9,If you have more questions later I always love them.,65,,
409,0.97,2269.9,2270.468,They're always spot on.,65,,
410,0.97,2270.468,2282.113,I see Council President who is joining us as a guest as a cosponsor and also Councilmember Mosqueda if you'd like to speak after that.,65,,
411,0.97,2282.113,2284.015,"Council President, welcome.",65,,
412,0.97,2284.015,2287.518,Thank you so much chair Strauss.,66,,
413,0.97,2287.518,2291.589,I'm intrigued by this conversation around unfair competition.,66,,
414,0.97,2291.589,2306.203,"So my question, my line of questions are going to focus around that concept.",66,,
415,0.97,2306.203,2331.395,Perhaps the memo is missing sort of a comparison chart that might have been helpful to the ability to understand the argument around unfair competition between brick and mortar existing small businesses and Home-Based businesses which are already legal.,66,,
416,0.97,2331.395,2331.862,They already exist.,66,,
417,0.97,2331.862,2337.034,Brick and mortar small businesses in our commercial districts.,66,,
418,0.97,2337.034,2362.126,My question is when we look at what this bill does we know that Council bill 120001 relaxes the limitations on first thing the number of employees that can be in the Home-Based business.,66,,
419,0.97,2362.126,2374.271,"Ketil or anybody, director Assefa, can you let us know whether existing brick and mortar small businesses in it commercial districts have a restriction as to the number of employees?",66,,
420,0.97,2374.271,2374.905,I can answer that.,67,,
421,0.97,2374.905,2380.845,To my knowledge there's no restriction on the number of employees that can be in a commercially leased space.,67,,
422,0.97,2380.845,2393.524,"There may be some restriction that is imposed by the landlord or something like that, but there's not, and there may also be a code, there's some code limitations on the occupancy of a space depending on how large it is.",67,,
423,0.97,2393.524,2398.262,But there's not an employee specific limitation.,67,,
424,0.97,2398.262,2401.665,"Then Council President, I'll add on to that.",68,,
425,0.97,2401.665,2406.003,All of these businesses still from to abide by public health guidelines.,68,,
426,0.97,2406.003,2420.217,"If the space is not large enough for that number of employees that's a consideration, just highlighting that the land use code is the bottom layer of all of these staff regulations.",68,,
427,0.97,2420.217,2421.719,Regulatory bodies and licenses.,68,,
428,0.97,2421.719,2422.086,Correct.,69,,
429,0.97,2422.086,2436.3,"So there are occupancy limits largely fueled by other public health considerations but what I'm focusing in on is the, I'm trying to compare and contrast where the unfair competition may exist or may not exist.",69,,
430,0.97,2436.3,2452.449,So I am not aware of brick and mortar small businesses who have a commercial lease having the number of employees limited by virtue of having that commercial lease relationship and being in a brick and mortar building.,69,,
431,0.97,2452.449,2463.561,Unlike Home-Based businesses which do have that restriction of the number of employees they are legally permitted to have in a Home-Based business.,69,,
432,0.97,2463.561,2465.563,That was my first question.,69,,
433,0.97,2465.563,2490.354,"My second question is similarly as it relates to brick and mortar small businesses in commercial districts that have a commercial lease, are they restricted in terms of the type of customer visits they're allowed to receive as compared to Home-Based businesses which are currently restricted in terms of the type of customer businesses.",69,,
434,0.97,2490.354,2493.023,Not to my knowledge.,70,,
435,0.97,2493.023,2501.332,If you walk up businesses in a neighborhood commercial district can be visited by any number of customers.,70,,
436,0.97,2501.332,2513.377,There is a limitation in the code what Council President is highlighting currently in the Cde if it you want to visit a Home-Based business you cannot walk up to that Home-Based business.,70,,
437,0.97,2513.377,2517.414,You have to have an appointment and gain access that way.,70,,
438,0.97,2517.414,2524.922,That is a distinction between a home occupation and a commercial business.,70,,
439,0.97,2524.922,2526.991,And again the last two.,71,,
440,0.97,2526.991,2529.46,Did you want to add something?,71,,
441,0.97,2529.46,2532.496,I'm agreeing with what Ketil said.,72,,
442,0.97,2532.496,2532.83,He's correct.,72,,
443,0.97,2532.83,2533.097,Okay.,73,,
444,0.97,2533.097,2544.241,"And then the last two things that this bill does is increase traffic and parking demand, loosens up those restrictions.",73,,
445,0.97,2544.241,2551.982,And the Noncommercial appearance of home occupations which I don't think fairly applies to commercial businesses.,73,,
446,0.97,2551.982,2554.618,Is it related to increased traffic and parking demand.,73,,
447,0.97,2554.618,2573.804,Are there any regulations or restrictions that currently apply to brick and mortar small businesses and commercial districts that have a commercial lease that require some compliance or evaluation of how their specific business increases traffic and parking demand in their geographic area?,73,,
448,0.97,2573.804,2576.974,I think the answer to that is not really.,74,,
449,0.97,2576.974,2588.319,I mean depending on a use that may be going into a space it may require review pursuant to the state of our policy act which has sort of a traffic analysis component to it.,74,,
450,0.97,2588.319,2593.19,But that would have to be a pretty big change.,74,,
451,0.97,2593.19,2600.864,A limitation that exists in the code at kind of a higher level is a limitation on types of uses.,74,,
452,0.97,2600.864,2611.608,"So, you know, depending on the scale of a neighborhood business district there may or may not be uses that are big traffic generators.",74,,
453,0.97,2611.608,2622.953,That's a higher level that's not necessarily related to the traffic impacts associated with a particular use that would incorporate other aspects of use as well.,74,,
454,0.97,2622.953,2628.058,"If a Starbucks with a drive through, that's a use that's only permitted in certain zones.",74,,
455,0.97,2628.058,2628.759,Drive through businesses.,74,,
456,0.97,2628.759,2648.746,So there are ways in which traffic is limited by the zoning code but for most business owners who are signing a lease on a small commercial space those types of regulations are not going to apply to them.,74,,
457,0.97,2648.746,2649.179,Great.,75,,
458,0.97,2649.179,2684.381,"And then and again, I think as it relates to the unfair competition concerns, I think if there are additional questions around doing a sort of back to the basics policy, policy comparison between the regulatory framework of what applies to home occupations and what applies to small business districts might have been a little more helpful in terms of evaluating whether or not there is true unfair competition.",75,,
459,0.97,2684.381,2687.918,That would be created by this bill.,75,,
460,0.97,2687.918,2711.008,Just based on this line of questioning and your answers to me it seems the unfair competition currently exists and it exists and that bias exists against Home-Based businesses and not brick and mortar small businesses that engage in commercial leasing of space that are regulated by the land use code.,75,,
461,0.97,2711.008,2725.956,So for me this bill is an opportunity to address unfair competition that currently exists against Home-Based businesses that are more stringently regulated.,75,,
462,0.97,2725.956,2730.728,And that's true whether we're in a pandemic or not.,75,,
463,0.97,2730.728,2736.166,That regulation exists whether we're in a pandemic or not.,75,,
464,0.97,2736.166,2745.042,The question is knowing that commercial lease spaces are becoming increasingly Inaffordable.,75,,
465,0.97,2745.042,2751.181,Knowing Thatcommercial lease spaces are increasing in terms of number of vacancies and future of the ability of those spaces.,75,,
466,0.97,2751.181,2761.759,I think this is a unique moment in our efforts to revitalize neighborhoods and to invest in our local economy.,75,,
467,0.97,2761.759,2775.873,"To begin the process now of creating a Pathway to, from garages to brick and mortar commercial lease spaces that might not otherwise be available.",75,,
468,0.97,2775.873,2781.278,That Pathway might not otherwise be available for any of these Home-Based businesses we are hoping this bill will help.,75,,
469,0.97,2781.278,2792.456,Last thing I want to address is the issue of Permanency in this interim nature of this legislation.,75,,
470,0.97,2792.456,2813.544,"Maybe we can talk a little bit more about what we mean when we say that we're exploring a potential to make this, these less restrictive regulations permanent.",75,,
471,0.97,2813.544,2836.166,"I think we can benefit from hearing more about what that process, what legally we would be required in order to do before this Council could even begin a conversation around creating Permanency as opposed to the legislation just applying during the pandemic.",75,,
472,0.97,2836.166,2836.967,Sure.,76,,
473,0.97,2836.967,2838.001,Thank you for that question.,76,,
474,0.97,2838.001,2858.822,So the term of this ordinance is one year and there's an aspect of that which is kind of based on the mechanics of the authority under state law that the bill would be enacted under.,76,,
475,0.97,2858.822,2862.793,Allows local jurisdictions to set up interim development controls.,76,,
476,0.97,2862.793,2863.794,Things that don't last forever.,76,,
477,0.97,2863.794,2865.829,Those come with two time periods.,76,,
478,0.97,2865.829,2869.7,One is a year and the other is six months.,76,,
479,0.97,2869.7,2876.006,If a jurisdiction wants interim controls to last up to a year there must be a work program.,76,,
480,0.97,2876.006,2880.277,There must be a Pathway towards considering more permanent regulations.,76,,
481,0.97,2880.277,2889.753,That is one of the reasons there is a work program contained in this bill so that Council will have the benefit of Sdci's work about a year from now.,76,,
482,0.97,2889.753,2892.256,Also so that the changes will last a year.,76,,
483,0.97,2892.256,2903.267,A lot of the questions that you're raising are excellent questions and ones that could be answered about a year from now with some work probably by the office of economic development and Sdci.,76,,
484,0.97,2903.267,2910.207,There are a if few logical ways this could all play out.,76,,
485,0.97,2910.207,2915.746,After a year Sdci could could recommend we make no changes.,76,,
486,0.97,2915.746,2920.317,The city has relatively permissive home regulations.,76,,
487,0.97,2920.317,2924.755,The city could decide and propose pot Council that nothing change.,76,,
488,0.97,2924.755,2933.096,In which case after a year the ordinance expires and all of the changes in the ordinance go away.,76,,
489,0.97,2933.096,2947.744,It could be the case that Sdci recommends that there be a change to how we regulate home occupations to address some of the competition concerns.,76,,
490,0.97,2947.744,2949.246,"Home occupations, other jurisdictions do.",76,,
491,0.97,2949.246,2957.954,They set a land use permit requirement based on some sort of threshold about the size of a business and what kind of impact that business may have.,76,,
492,0.97,2957.954,2971.568,May be the case that Sdci recommends to the Council that we begin to require permits for certain types of home occupations that are above a certain special or post a neighborhood business districts.,76,,
493,0.97,2971.568,2975.772,We have some experience with this in a street use context.,76,,
494,0.97,2975.772,2991.288,A few years ago the city modified regulations for food trucks and one of the environments that is built into the regulations is that those food trucks can't be parked on the same block face as an existing restaurant.,76,,
495,0.97,2991.288,2997.294,Some kind of requirement like that could be built into a proposal from the future.,76,,
496,0.97,2997.294,3016.179,"Those are some, the benefit of future analysis there'll be some policy choices for the Council to make about whether and how to modify our home occupations on a permanent basis to address, balance the competing concerns with Incubational small businesses.",76,,
497,0.97,3016.179,3022.119,A level playing field with those businesses occupying spaces in our neighborhood commercial districts.,76,,
498,0.97,3022.119,3044.141,"So one of the things that I'll be honest I get frustrated about is the city's tendency to engage in short term pilot projects and pilot projects that are, you know, designed to be two months or three months or four months.",77,,
499,0.97,3044.141,3058.188,"It takes longer period of testing and innovative new model in order to truly, truly change or understand human adaptation and behavior to those modifications.",77,,
500,0.97,3058.188,3064.661,This is something when I went to Copenhagen a few years ago feels like ages ago at this point.,77,,
501,0.97,3064.661,3079.242,"One of the things that they talked about in terms of how we transform the public realm for safe, healthy public use is that pilot projects can't just be, you know, two or three months.",77,,
502,0.97,3079.242,3087.918,"That the best practice, the best standard is to strive to have a pilot project that would last up to a year.",77,,
503,0.97,3087.918,3112.542,To truly allow people who are used to using a particular space in a particular way since the beginning of time and opportunity to have a more meaningful engagement with how the use of a space has changed and modified and that kind of effort really yields to better policy because it's much more thoughtful.,77,,
504,0.97,3112.542,3121.084,Much more engaging and much more accurately reflective of the sentiment of people who ordinarily use that space.,77,,
505,0.97,3121.084,3160.323,So for me I see this interim use as an opportunity for us to collect actively Proactively collect that data that could then be utilized in addition to the work plan information to really get a good understanding of where the playing field may not currently be level and how this legislation can be shaped in the future to promote a Pathway for Micro Enterprises into commercial space without creating unnecessary competition.,77,,
506,0.97,3160.323,3165.695,I'm excited about this legislation for a lot of reasons.,77,,
507,0.97,3165.695,3172.335,I appreciate the opportunity to engage in that line of questioning as an alternate guest of this Committee.,77,,
508,0.97,3172.335,3173.904,Thank you chair Strauss.,77,,
509,0.97,3173.904,3184.08,I'm going to sit here quietly now until right before you call this for a vote.,77,,
510,0.97,3184.08,3185.482,"Thank you, Council President.",78,,
511,0.97,3185.482,3194.624,I know your office has been helping out as well.,78,,
512,0.97,3194.624,3198.895,Really does require four years of implementation to come into full effect.,78,,
513,0.97,3198.895,3205.902,I know that you went to Copenhagen in the 20 teens.,78,,
514,0.97,3205.902,3208.538,Feels like a decade ago already.,78,,
515,0.97,3208.538,3209.539,Here we are 2021.,78,,
516,0.97,3209.539,3213.009,Vice chair Mosqueda also a cosponsor on the bill.,78,,
517,0.97,3213.009,3218.949,Then Council member Pedersen is your hand raised from earlier or is that new?,78,,
518,0.97,3218.949,3219.316,That's new.,79,,
519,0.97,3219.316,3220.417,Great.,80,,
520,0.97,3220.417,3227.958,"We'll hear from vice chair Mosqueda, Councilmember Pedersen.",80,,
521,0.97,3227.958,3229.326,Take it away.,80,,
522,0.97,3229.326,3231.127,Thank you very much.,81,,
523,0.97,3231.127,3232.228,I appreciate being here.,81,,
524,0.97,3232.228,3236.6,Thank you for allowing me to be a cosponsor with you and the coup sill President.,81,,
525,0.97,3236.6,3238.935,I'm excited for this legislation.,81,,
526,0.97,3238.935,3241.137,I appreciate the amendment you've included here.,81,,
527,0.97,3241.137,3262.392,I do have a few summary thoughts about why I think it's important for us to move forward on this and some comments as well regarding the issues around parking and I would say also the on going conversation around whether or not this is going to be any form of unfair advantage for other entrepreneurs.,81,,
528,0.97,3262.392,3264.294,Let my say thank you so much.,81,,
529,0.97,3264.294,3271.668,During this pandemic especially I think it's important for us to recognize that Covid has absolutely turned our economy upside down.,81,,
530,0.97,3271.668,3277.807,"Our daily life patterns, our routines, nothing is like it was before.",81,,
531,0.97,3277.807,3292.722,"The current rules for small businesses make it difficult for folks to respond quickly and to try to create economic stability for their community, for their family if they're not able to potentially open a small business if they have the ability to do that in their home.",81,,
532,0.97,3292.722,3310.14,I think this is a really important tool for us to be able to advance during this pandemic and then to absolutely look at its potential benefits for a longer term to make sure our city can respond more quickly as local entrepreneurs want to open businesses across the city.,81,,
533,0.97,3310.14,3316.046,This isn't business usual because frankly business as usual in the city has made it very hard sometimes for small businesses to open.,81,,
534,0.97,3316.046,3326.656,I'm excited about the opportunity Thatst been provided by this and I think this is a citywide benefit as we think about the number of people who could potentially benefit from this type of ordinance.,81,,
535,0.97,3326.656,3340.804,We also know that especially immigrants and people of color are also less willing to sort of push the envelope and keep asking for change and I really applaud yonder bar for putting this issue on our radar.,81,,
536,0.97,3340.804,3354.684,"As the sponsors have noted repeatedly, this is about the entire city and actually looking at the entire benefit across the fabric of our communities to try to make it easier for small businesses to open and stay open.",81,,
537,0.97,3354.684,3373.87,"Coronavirus has laid bare our inequities by creating barriers to being able to access true economic stability and I think by suspending some of these rules we're recognizing that our local community, entrepreneurs, these shops are doing everything they can to make it through these challenging times.",81,,
538,0.97,3373.87,3388.418,I'm excited to be a sponsor of this interim policy and I do hope that we continue to look for ways to make this part of our longer term solution to make our communities more resilient.,81,,
539,0.97,3388.418,3389.919,To make them more Walkable.,81,,
540,0.97,3389.919,3391.221,To make them more sustainable.,81,,
541,0.97,3391.221,3399.129,As we think about opening up more small business shops across the city I also note that it has to be coupled with more housing.,81,,
542,0.97,3399.129,3399.729,More housing opportunities.,81,,
543,0.97,3399.729,3404.634,"We want this to be a Walkable, livable, economically viable city for everyone who lives here.",81,,
544,0.97,3404.634,3414.677,"A lot of of that means making sure there are stores, more access to child cares accident more Street cafes and Multifriendly structures.",81,,
545,0.97,3414.677,3421.151,I do want to address some of the questions that came up with sort of my own perspective about why I'm supporting this legislation.,81,,
546,0.97,3421.151,3429.192,I would say that the existing code doesn't actually work for encouraging entrepreneurs.,81,,
547,0.97,3429.192,3438.001,"For example, Councilmember Juarez I know before I wasn't on the committee but talked about a Fry bread shop.",81,,
548,0.97,3438.001,3439.936,I've been talking about tasty Tacos.,81,,
549,0.97,3439.936,3447.477,If we wanted to create that in our front yards through our garages it would make absolutely no sense to do it by appointment only.,81,,
550,0.97,3447.477,3450.013,It would make no sense to have no sign out there.,81,,
551,0.97,3450.013,3460.056,"It would not even be feasible to do this with just two people that don't work in, that are not part of our families.",81,,
552,0.97,3460.056,3464.127,Those are just not requirements that work for encouraging entrepreneurs.,81,,
553,0.97,3464.127,3467.831,"It's also, you know, I think important for us to look for ways to address that fourth pillar.",81,,
554,0.97,3467.831,3471.901,How do we make sure there is not traffic congestion?,81,,
555,0.97,3471.901,3473.002,That's something I actually support.,81,,
556,0.97,3473.002,3478.074,And by some of the amendments we're making today we're encouraging foot traffic.,81,,
557,0.97,3478.074,3482.779,We're encouraging visibility from the street.,81,,
558,0.97,3482.779,3492.856,I do want to talk about the concerns about the parking requirements and I'm going to refer to page 27 from this report which some of you probably already read.,81,,
559,0.97,3492.856,3498.328,It's called a better city from 2016 future parking in Boston.,81,,
560,0.97,3498.328,3505.001,It looks at parking and entrepreneur opportunities across the city and they did it across city comparison.,81,,
561,0.97,3505.001,3506.135,I'm going to cite New York.,81,,
562,0.97,3506.135,3511.074,I'm going to cite Portland and a few O'Citys where they looked at cur space.,81,,
563,0.97,3511.074,3527.957,"People think the curb space in front of your business is the most viable thing to protect but it's actually sort of Counterintuitive to promoting what small businesses want and that's additional traffic in their stores, foot traffic and additional revenue.",81,,
564,0.97,3527.957,3537.0,The curbside space is the most valuable space given its proximity to the business but not for the reasons you might think.,81,,
565,0.97,3537.0,3540.536,It's not about grabbing that spot and jumping into the shop.,81,,
566,0.97,3540.536,3548.745,The curb when it is occupied by parked cars conflicts with pedestrians who want to be able to walk around and see what's in the neighborhood.,81,,
567,0.97,3548.745,3551.648,It conflicts with bicycle and bicycle parking.,81,,
568,0.97,3551.648,3554.984,And the visibility of the small business from the street.,81,,
569,0.97,3554.984,3573.87,"So in Portland, Oregon when they reallocated or removed on site Street parking from right in front of the shops they saw that the commercial areas those small commercial shops actually had greater room for bike Corrals and greater visibility from the street.",81,,
570,0.97,3573.87,3582.545,And a preliminary survey of adjacent businesses showed there was a 52% increase in the business' viability from the street.,81,,
571,0.97,3582.545,3587.817,And a 67% increase for foot traffic and bike traffic.,81,,
572,0.97,3587.817,3592.655,All of which contributes to increased business activity and revenue.,81,,
573,0.97,3592.655,3593.923,That's from the report.,81,,
574,0.97,3593.923,3595.692,"Further more when looking at Brooklyn, New York.",81,,
575,0.97,3595.692,3614.41,"They looked at the number of unused, underutilized parking spots and they converted those areas to public event areas and removed the parking requirements, there was an increase in visibility to the small businesses.",81,,
576,0.97,3614.41,3620.249,And saw 172% increase in retail sales at locally created businesses.,81,,
577,0.97,3620.249,3623.252,This is about supporting those small businesses.,81,,
578,0.97,3623.252,3625.188,Especially as we think about what's happening right now.,81,,
579,0.97,3625.188,3627.724,I've talked about this before.,81,,
580,0.97,3627.724,3634.43,I am not driving across the city like we used to but I am walking way more in my neighborhood than I used to.,81,,
581,0.97,3634.43,3636.366,I'm walking to those local small businesses.,81,,
582,0.97,3636.366,3645.341,As we think about folks coming out of their Ohm and engaging more in their communities I want more people to Talkwalk around their neighborhoods but I also want them to walk around other economic hubs.,81,,
583,0.97,3645.341,3656.419,I think this is actually a way for us to continue to increase visibility from the street and improve Walkability and Bikability.,81,,
584,0.97,3656.419,3660.556,Also to improve the economic viability of those small businesses.,81,,
585,0.97,3660.556,3663.593,We are doing some of the things the study talks about.,81,,
586,0.97,3663.593,3665.561,We've started some of these things before Covid.,81,,
587,0.97,3665.561,3681.01,We had been working on creating more parking vacations in some of these spots that were usually used just for one car parking and we've converted many of those spaces Pre-Covid into parking for bikes.,81,,
588,0.97,3681.01,3681.944,Now look what we've done.,81,,
589,0.97,3681.944,3689.285,We've turned a number of these parking spots into outside Eateries H is good during Covid time.,81,,
590,0.97,3689.285,3695.925,But as the report noted it's good for the businesses to be able to have that outside dining area to begin with.,81,,
591,0.97,3695.925,3713.342,I think this piece of legislation will be very similar and we will continue to see that by making more small businesses be able to open in neighborhoods that don't actually have access to these types of small entrepreneurial opportunities right now we'll continue to see greater foot traffic.,81,,
592,0.97,3713.342,3717.213,The small businesses are going to see more people walking around the neighborhood.,81,,
593,0.97,3717.213,3726.722,"And the businesses that already exist will potentially see more patrons, more foot traffic, more people engaging coming in to Browse the stores and more purchases.",81,,
594,0.97,3726.722,3733.663,I think it's a great way for us to make sure we're engaging across the city.,81,,
595,0.97,3733.663,3734.897,Creating more economic local hubs.,81,,
596,0.97,3734.897,3745.608,I think it's an economic stimulant that I do hope the data will show that this will be a way for us in the long term to encourage more entrepreneurs across our city.,81,,
597,0.97,3745.608,3748.845,Finally from the equity perspective.,81,,
598,0.97,3748.845,3759.188,Every single report talks about the fact that the Covid-Induced recession has disproportionately affected women and people of color.,81,,
599,0.97,3759.188,3761.991,In terms of lost jobs.,81,,
600,0.97,3761.991,3762.959,Lost hours and lost livelihood.,81,,
601,0.97,3762.959,3774.47,If we want to think about how W create a more equitable recovery we have to be thinking about ways that we allow for people to use their entrepreneurial spirit.,81,,
602,0.97,3774.47,3780.076,The tools at their disposal and to allow them to open up new shops.,81,,
603,0.97,3780.076,3784.28,This is an economic stimulant specifically for our communities across the city.,81,,
604,0.97,3784.28,3813.342,"I believe who have been disproportionately impacted by the impacts of Covid and I think it will have a positive impact for those who have been hardest hit by Covid and to the question around competition, will actually help the small businesses who have been able to sustain or are barely hanging on during this crisis as they begin to open their doors as well it will be a stimulant to those existing businesses as we see greater foot traffic and economic activities.",81,,
605,0.97,3813.342,3818.781,"As we create more economic stability, especially for those who have been hardest hit by Covid.",81,,
606,0.97,3818.781,3821.684,Those individuals once they are successful have cash in land.,81,,
607,0.97,3821.684,3828.291,When people have cash in hand they spend is in their local communities.,81,,
608,0.97,3828.291,3831.227,They spend is in existing businesses.,81,,
609,0.97,3831.227,3832.395,This is a stimulant.,81,,
610,0.97,3832.395,3841.07,"This is a, this has a Multiplier effect for our economic viability across the city.",81,,
611,0.97,3841.07,3845.942,And I could not end my comments without talking about the beginnings of tasty Tacos.,81,,
612,0.97,3845.942,3851.347,"In des Moines, Iowa my grandparents started tasty Tacos in 1961.",81,,
613,0.97,3851.347,3854.15,This was the year after my dad graduated high school.,81,,
614,0.97,3854.15,3855.885,He's the oldest of six kids.,81,,
615,0.97,3855.885,3865.361,And my grandparents did everything they could to help make sure that there was a roof over their head if the Kiddos and that people had food on the table.,81,,
616,0.97,3865.361,3871.968,After working very different types of jobs over the years my grandparents started tasty Tacos.,81,,
617,0.97,3871.968,3876.405,In the small garage in front of the House they were renting.,81,,
618,0.97,3876.405,3887.516,My Grandpa talks about how it was started out of a hole in the wall because it was literally the hole in front of their wall where the garage was.,81,,
619,0.97,3887.516,3893.956,And his motto is Nada es impossible.,81,,
620,0.97,3893.956,3894.457,Nothing is impossible.,81,,
621,0.97,3894.457,3911.641,"Because it truly started out of the front of their home and now here we are decades later and it's voted the best Taco place in des Moines, Iowa every single year and it is, they now have six restaurants.",81,,
622,0.97,3911.641,3914.51,And they got out of generational poverty.,81,,
623,0.97,3914.51,3922.018,This is what it means to create more opportunities during this crisis and hopefully this will be a longer term piece of policy that we can continue to see advance.,81,,
624,0.97,3922.018,3928.424,I'm happy to support it and thank you for your leadership on this Councilmember Strauss and Council President.,81,,
625,0.97,3928.424,3933.529,Thank you vice chair Mosqueda.,82,,
626,0.97,3933.529,3934.03,Points well taken.,82,,
627,0.97,3934.03,3947.243,Especially talking about the vacant store fronts we have in our city and how one of the reasons I'm downtown right now and one of the reasons I'm having trouble finding lunch I wish tasty Tacos was here is because people are not working in their offices.,82,,
628,0.97,3947.243,3950.179,They're spending time in their neighborhoods.,82,,
629,0.97,3950.179,3961.357,It's important we provide opportunities to make our residential neighborhoods more vibrant as we weren't expecting to spend so much time there.,82,,
630,0.97,3961.357,3962.391,Is your point about jobs.,82,,
631,0.97,3962.391,3964.96,These small businesses are creating jobs.,82,,
632,0.97,3964.96,3973.669,That speaks to why it's important to remove that limitation on how many people can be working in the space.,82,,
633,0.97,3973.669,3975.938,It has to abide by public Halth guidelines.,82,,
634,0.97,3975.938,3980.376,We don't need to be that barrier.,82,,
635,0.97,3980.376,3983.179,"Whether it's Fry bread, tasty Tacos or coffee roasting.",82,,
636,0.97,3983.179,3996.826,"There is still in this bill a provision that if a complaint was received because of smell, noise, glare that a complaint could be filed.",82,,
637,0.97,3996.826,3998.294,That is still part of the bill.,82,,
638,0.97,3998.294,4003.833,What we do know is that when people are good neighbors with each other that those complaints don't get filed.,82,,
639,0.97,4003.833,4015.745,That's why we have so many businesses across the city right now operating out of the compliance with the code because their neighbors haven't complained.,82,,
640,0.97,4015.745,4020.349,This just creates that level playing field.,82,,
641,0.97,4020.349,4022.651,"Councilmember Pedersen, I see you are up next.",82,,
642,0.97,4022.651,4024.854,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",83,,
643,0.97,4024.854,4025.388,Thanks to my colleagues.,83,,
644,0.97,4025.388,4027.356,I agree with a lot of what you're saying.,83,,
645,0.97,4027.356,4029.859,I do have concerns about this bill which I'll talk about now.,83,,
646,0.97,4029.859,4057.553,"Despite my concerns about this bill I would like to thank the original author chair Strauss for providing enough time to consider this legislation when some bills are often quickly rushed through the city council although this was discussed quickly, chair Strauss provided ample time and grace in his committee on February 24th to air the concerns and provide staff time to analyze it.",83,,
647,0.97,4057.553,4058.087,Since then.,83,,
648,0.97,4058.087,4073.969,"So ultimately though the subsequent memo from our central staff analyst, conversations with the Department that will implement this legislation and most importantly my Outreac to small businesses did not alleviate the concerns I raised during the previous committee meeting on February 24th.",83,,
649,0.97,4073.969,4079.909,In fact many business districts had not heard of this legislation and offered additional concerns.,83,,
650,0.97,4079.909,4082.178,I have consistently and strongly supported small business.,83,,
651,0.97,4082.178,4092.221,"Last year I worked hard to renew the neighborhood business improvement area for the University district, a very diverse business district in the heart of district four.",83,,
652,0.97,4092.221,4099.161,Over 65% of those businesses are owned by women and people of color.,83,,
653,0.97,4099.161,4106.869,For small businesses I supported financial and regulatory relief and recovery programs throughout the Covid pandemic.,83,,
654,0.97,4106.869,4119.181,My recent op Ed for an Increasive economic recovery points to ways government can and should work with local employers to get people back to work and achieve an Increasive economic recovery.,83,,
655,0.97,4119.181,4130.993,Significant private sector conspiracy and after studying this issue Council bill 120- 0001 is not the most appropriate intervention at this time.,83,,
656,0.97,4130.993,4139.301,It is because of my support of existing small businesses in our neighborhood business districts that I have remaining concerns with the bill.,83,,
657,0.97,4139.301,4148.777,On my city council Blog I'll post all of my concerns in more detail so I can fully explain my vote to my constituents.,83,,
658,0.97,4148.777,4151.847,For committee now I'll summarize a few key points.,83,,
659,0.97,4151.847,4157.453,First it's important to note as we discussed Home-Based small businesses are already allowed under the code.,83,,
660,0.97,4157.453,4161.39,This bill would remove some of the requirements.,83,,
661,0.97,4161.39,4168.163,"Second, this bill is framed as needing to address stresses on small businesses due to the Covid pandemic.",83,,
662,0.97,4168.163,4171.901,However the bill is not written time limited to the pandemic.,83,,
663,0.97,4171.901,4178.841,It instead SETS up a starting point for potential permanent change in the land use code for the city.,83,,
664,0.97,4178.841,4196.892,"Third, the proposed changes will make it possible for retail, food and drink establishments to proliferate everywhere in the city with too little consideration of the impacts on existing small businesses struggling to reopen and Rehire.",83,,
665,0.97,4196.892,4205.134,"These small business owners are not only paying their rent on their lease, long term lease that they're in the middle of right now.",83,,
666,0.97,4205.134,4210.339,But also paying rent on their personal residence or a mortgage.,83,,
667,0.97,4210.339,4220.983,And there's I believe too little consideration on the impacts on the residential areas due to increased deliveries and customer traffic that would be expected.,83,,
668,0.97,4220.983,4229.325,"Fourth, I'm concerned that the legislation will distract a key city Department.",83,,
669,0.97,4229.325,4238.367,Our Department of construction and inspections Sdci is already behind on improving permits and delivering an overdue ordinance to protect our trees.,83,,
670,0.97,4238.367,4242.171,We heard a couple of speakers address this issue.,83,,
671,0.97,4242.171,4245.24,They're concerned about the tree ordinance taking too long.,83,,
672,0.97,4245.24,4259.355,"I believe this would be Saddling the city government staff to develop, monitor this new program and ultimately enforce complaints about the new program which could delay their other priorities around the Department.",83,,
673,0.97,4259.355,4267.262,From the dozens of E-Mails we've received it appears there are one or two small businesses behind that push for the legislation.,83,,
674,0.97,4267.262,4270.499,This would impact the entire city of Seattle.,83,,
675,0.97,4270.499,4280.075,I think the needs of a single small business having trouble with the city's complex and often confusing zoning and land use codes are legitimate and should be addressed.,83,,
676,0.97,4280.075,4285.914,Personally I don't think this warrants land use changes Impacting all of Seattle.,83,,
677,0.97,4285.914,4295.357,Would rather see a one off exceptions rather than blanket city-wide changes.,83,,
678,0.97,4295.357,4299.028,Talked about incubating small businesses which I completely support.,83,,
679,0.97,4299.028,4308.57,The Office of economic development has a program on their Website startup resources for small businesses.,83,,
680,0.97,4308.57,4325.587,Incubation of small businesses is an effort that I hope office of economic development would get more involved in it and there have been lots of success incubating small businesses by clustering them together.,83,,
681,0.97,4325.587,4331.727,"Cluster together to attract customers, foot traffic so they can mutually benefit from the additional foot traffic.",83,,
682,0.97,4331.727,4338.233,"Same with incubating small businesses together in a single space so they share rent, get technical assistance.",83,,
683,0.97,4338.233,4343.038,Learn from each other as they grow and expand.,83,,
684,0.97,4343.038,4347.042,Some small businesses could become vendors at farmers markets.,83,,
685,0.97,4347.042,4349.311,We have a year round farmers market.,83,,
686,0.97,4349.311,4353.248,There are lots of opportunities to Incubate small businesses.,83,,
687,0.97,4353.248,4366.829,I would rather see one off exceptions made rather than blanket citywide changes.,83,,
688,0.97,4366.829,4367.129,Thank you.,83,,
689,0.97,4367.129,4374.603,The neighborhood business district Phinney Association indicated their support of this bill and support and they're just a block or two away.,84,,
690,0.97,4374.603,4382.211,As well as brandy Cruz who is usually very critical of city Council and had good words to say about you this morning also stated her support for this bill.,84,,
691,0.97,4382.211,4396.625,I want to highlight the fact that the Timeline needs to be set in had stone so it is clear for all people engaging in this process to know exactly when this is going to end.,84,,
692,0.97,4396.625,4398.861,It's not clear when the civil state of emergency will end.,84,,
693,0.97,4398.861,4411.206,We just want to be very clear with all Stakeholders and the public.,84,,
694,0.97,4411.206,4416.345,Inspectors who do inspection Online aren't part of the permitting pipeline.,84,,
695,0.97,4416.345,4423.519,We were supposed to have a robust briefing but apparently the presentation is stuck in the pipeline upstairs.,84,,
696,0.97,4423.519,4424.286,We'll get to that.,84,,
697,0.97,4424.286,4426.355,You speak about the exceptions to the land use code.,84,,
698,0.97,4426.355,4434.296,I want to make sure that it's Vry clear that we attempted to look for the ability to create exceptions.,84,,
699,0.97,4434.296,4439.868,And land use code can't have exceptions unless you change the code.,84,,
700,0.97,4439.868,4452.614,"That is why this is an experiment bill because it--we need to make a temporary change to the land use code because the Inspeck SOARS are, they can't be subjective.",84,,
701,0.97,4452.614,4455.35,It has to be yes or no.,84,,
702,0.97,4455.35,4455.918,One or zero.,84,,
703,0.97,4455.918,4463.692,"We need to give them that flexibility for, kind of just like what you said.",84,,
704,0.97,4463.692,4464.126,One off exception.,84,,
705,0.97,4464.126,4476.572,When we looked a in the bill the majority of the code requirements for home occupancy businesses do remain.,84,,
706,0.97,4476.572,4478.207,And we just changed a few of them.,84,,
707,0.97,4478.207,4479.174,I see your hand up.,84,,
708,0.97,4479.174,4483.779,Do you have something else to say?,84,,
709,0.97,4483.779,4484.279,No.,84,,
710,0.97,4484.279,4486.148,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,84,,
711,0.97,4486.148,4493.222,Looking around the zoom room do we--Councilmember Juarez.,84,,
712,0.97,4493.222,4493.455,Please.,84,,
713,0.97,4493.455,4495.591,So are we going to go to a vote now?,85,,
714,0.97,4495.591,4498.293,Can I say something before we go?,85,,
715,0.97,4498.293,4498.56,Yeah.,86,,
716,0.97,4498.56,4498.794,Please.,86,,
717,0.97,4498.794,4501.53,Then we'll go to a vote?,87,,
718,0.97,4501.53,4504.867,I think what we heard today everyone agrees with.,87,,
719,0.97,4504.867,4505.834,No one's against this.,87,,
720,0.97,4505.834,4512.274,"No one--I mean, the four areas where you want to relax certain performance standards.",87,,
721,0.97,4512.274,4523.752,"They're all reasonable people can disagree and I don't think, I'm trying to compare brick and mortar to a garage because they're different.",87,,
722,0.97,4523.752,4530.092,More towards a more Holistic response is that we have this opening of this Appture of you will.,87,,
723,0.97,4530.092,4535.964,This time right now as we're bringing this forward to look at economic development through a social justice lens.,87,,
724,0.97,4535.964,4544.606,And if we were talking about a Pathway to Permanency and an incubation program which in another life I did many of these.,87,,
725,0.97,4544.606,4565.494,"If you're going to do a Pathway to Permanency, at some point you'll want to have, if these businesses at home on a path to Permanency want to find themselves as a store front store they're going to need the support from groups like the small business Association.",87,,
726,0.97,4565.494,4570.165,They're going to need the business and financial literacy that is required and needed for all that stuff.,87,,
727,0.97,4570.165,4592.02,"The dream is you start a business like Councilmember Mosqueda was saying in your garage and some day you have a store front and some day you have franchises and you build generational wealth that you can pass on to your children, your grandchildren and you can pay for your mortgage, you put your kids through college and if this is a starting point for that, that makes sense.",87,,
728,0.97,4592.02,4592.354,I get that.,87,,
729,0.97,4592.354,4595.991,"And I'm very, I'm glad we're talking and doing this.",87,,
730,0.97,4595.991,4610.672,"And so I'm not so concerned about whether or not there are more employees in the building or, I just want to be able to respond to some of the small businesses that this is a good thing.",87,,
731,0.97,4610.672,4619.815,You may find yourself not with more competitors but with a more vibrant business district that is more expansive and representative of our great city.,87,,
732,0.97,4619.815,4621.283,With that thank you very much.,87,,
733,0.97,4621.283,4626.521,I will be voting to support this.,87,,
734,0.97,4626.521,4626.822,Thank you.,87,,
735,0.97,4626.822,4627.255,My goodness.,88,,
736,0.97,4627.255,4628.29,That is a Supreme.,88,,
737,0.97,4628.29,4631.96,We have to rename.,89,,
738,0.97,4631.96,4634.596,You have to rename it.,89,,
739,0.97,4634.596,4637.265,Or Ketil.,89,,
740,0.97,4637.265,4637.766,In Ketil's memo to me.,89,,
741,0.97,4637.766,4648.176,Wise person once said to me you have to be ready if you don't have the questions or the answers to all of Councilmember Juarez's questions you shouldn't be coming to Committee.,90,,
742,0.97,4648.176,4649.011,So thank you.,90,,
743,0.97,4649.011,4649.277,Okay.,91,,

752,0.97,4665.394,4676.438,I would just say Mr. chair I will be voting for this in spite of the fact brandy Cruz is supporting it.,95,,
753,0.97,4676.438,4676.972,"Appreciate, just a joke.",95,,
754,0.97,4676.972,4679.307,I will be voting for this.,95,,

768,0.97,4731.059,4731.259,So.,97,,
769,0.97,4731.259,4735.33,"Just going to throw that out there, see what brandy thinks about that.",97,,

844,0.97,5086.214,5090.318,Then jump on to 2021 work program.,120,,
845,0.97,5090.318,5098.893,So first I'll start with planning community development's key mission.,120,,
846,0.97,5098.893,5102.363,Equitable developments and create great places.,120,,
847,0.97,5102.363,5108.002,We also set goals from meeting with equity perspective.,120,,
848,0.97,5108.002,5122.584,"Primarily, racial disparities and achieve racial equity in all of the work we do through our work and engagement as planners and community developers.",120,,
849,0.97,5122.584,5130.325,That vision cannot be more true and important as it is in this time we're in after 2020.,120,,
850,0.97,5130.325,5134.696,I'll talk briefly about that.,120,,
851,0.97,5134.696,5139.033,Opcd 2021 budget has 42 full time employees.,120,,

853,0.97,5144.239,5149.177,This is the organization structure we have primarily for key divisions.,120,,
854,0.97,5149.177,5150.645,Plus two commissions.,120,,
855,0.97,5150.645,5162.59,Just quickly going from left to right the team that leads the equitable development initiative program.,120,,
856,0.97,5162.59,5171.499,Community planning that is specific neighborhood plans that team that work on the various neighborhood plants in the city.,120,,

858,0.97,5185.847,5186.814,Land use policy.,120,,
859,0.97,5186.814,5192.52,This is the team that focuses on very specific zoning policies.,120,,

862,0.97,5208.269,5217.011,As I go through the presentation and accomplishments divided by each of those divisions.,120,,
863,0.97,5217.011,5226.22,So starting with 2020 accomplishments as you know Opcd is not primary frontline emergency response Department.,120,,
864,0.97,5226.22,5239.734,"As a result, most of our work the beginning of the pandemic and the crisis in planning has been supporting the city's efforts in mitigation and response to the crisis.",120,,
865,0.97,5239.734,5246.14,Or a lot of our staff through multiple departments.,120,,
866,0.97,5246.14,5247.609,Office of economic many emergency response.,120,,
867,0.97,5247.609,5253.114,As well as work with office of economic developments on small business support mitigation work.,120,,

869,0.97,5262.423,5267.595,"However, we also have core work items that we continue to work.",120,,
870,0.97,5267.595,5269.697,I'll just highlight some of them.,120,,
871,0.97,5269.697,5282.644,Start with the long range planning population data.,120,,
872,0.97,5285.88,5289.55,We update the demographic Website regularly.,120,,
873,0.97,5289.55,5294.188,There was a lot of work on that in 2020.,120,,
874,0.97,5294.188,5303.531,"A new analysis on housing needs analysis, focused on the House bill that passed in 2019.",120,,
875,0.97,5303.531,5309.037,This bill focuses on opportunities in urban areas.,120,,
876,0.97,5309.037,5317.545,"On that basis, we are developing the next update with the base work on housing needs and analysis.",120,,
877,0.97,5317.545,5325.219,Staff are working on developing that and they continue to work on that.,120,,
878,0.97,5325.219,5333.161,"Then there was a significant amount of work, early work, on the update.",120,,
879,0.97,5333.161,5337.265,The update is required every seven years.,120,,
880,0.97,5337.265,5341.669,This year we will launch the next update.,120,,
881,0.97,5341.669,5345.773,Through Mid-2024.,120,,
882,0.97,5345.773,5362.256,"In 2020 we focused a lot on the base work, especially in equity analysis and requests around determining how best Land-Use policies over the past 20 or 30 years have responded to racial equity.",120,,
883,0.97,5362.256,5371.399,So that analysis is underway as the basis for a policy conversation around updates.,120,,
884,0.97,5371.399,5374.702,"We will be reporting to you soon, this quarter, on that study.",120,,
885,0.97,5374.702,5378.539,Then there is Buildable lands analysis.,120,,
886,0.97,5378.539,5382.477,This is part of the requirement.,120,,
887,0.97,5382.477,5392.086,For every update we look at the citywide capacity for growth and existing zoning.,120,,
888,0.97,5392.086,5403.831,And that data is also used to inform growth management and comprehensive plan policy objectives and objectives as we move forward.,120,,
889,0.97,5403.831,5410.338,Another is significant coordination with regional agencies.,120,,
890,0.97,5410.338,5419.147,"King County, Puget sound, and the state, around the state and the state's vision.",120,,

892,0.97,5425.253,5432.059,So a lot of that work has been going on in 2020 and some of it will continue this year.,120,,
893,0.97,5432.059,5445.072,"On community planning, some of the key highlights of the team, significant work obviously coordinating with state agencies around sound transit.",120,,

901,0.97,5500.461,5524.919,"Most of the latter half of last year we coordinated with Seattle public utilities, neighborhoods, transportation, and with the county, around policy issues, infrastructure issues, that are either in the planning stages or being envisioned, by the county, and some within the local area by the city, as well.",120,,
902,0.97,5524.919,5531.759,It provides a basis to inform community planning work.,120,,

906,0.97,5581.409,5583.978,"Staff also worked on developing a very accessible, usable Website.",120,,

989,0.97,6273.066,6282.009,We are coordinating with transportation and parks and understanding our public space needs.,120,,
990,0.97,6282.009,6290.117,"Our Land-Use policy team, major work in the strategy.",120,,
991,0.97,6290.117,6302.729,"We hope to complete the major part this year and work related to that this year, depending on the advisory group and Stakeholder recommendations.",120,,
992,0.97,6302.729,6304.231,"And housing policy, equitable zoning strategies.",120,,
993,0.97,6304.231,6327.054,"This is above and beyond development issues, but we are thinking of looking at what kind of zoning barriers, especially Bipoc communities, experience and how do we mitigate that as we move forward?",120,,
994,0.97,6327.054,6328.622,Code amendments and environmental review support.,120,,

998,0.97,6347.774,6355.716,Some of the key ones are the pipeline study.,120,,
999,0.97,6355.716,6358.952,Our leading designer lead that process over the last year.,120,,
1000,0.97,6358.952,6368.095,"If you recall, the University of Washington laundry site.",120,,
1001,0.97,6368.095,6376.403,We are coordinating on that to get an Rfp out with the hopes of housing leading that work.,120,,
1002,0.97,6376.403,6380.073,And a lot of interagency support around transit.,120,,
1003,0.97,6380.073,6384.311,The King County master plan.,120,,
1004,0.97,6384.311,6386.179,"The Dta, downtown transit Association.",120,,
1005,0.97,6386.179,6392.486,So we coordinate at a regional level.,120,,
1006,0.97,6392.486,6395.021,"Quickly, key findings for equitable development initiatives.",120,,
1007,0.97,6395.021,6406.299,"Continuing with 60 projects that are, in one form or another, funded as capacity building for capital projects.",120,,
1008,0.97,6406.299,6407.434,Engagement for that.,120,,
1009,0.97,6407.434,6430.59,"We worked, the team, as well as neighborhoods and facilities Department, worked on transferring to city-owned properties and the Mayor directed us a couple years ago to come up with a comprehensive policy for transfer of City- owned properties.",120,,
1010,0.97,6430.59,6443.97,So the senior center in the Entral district was transferred as part of that process and we will be continuing more of that this year.,120,,
1011,0.97,6443.97,6456.249,"And the strategic investment fund, the $30 million that we will be focusing on quickly, this year.",120,,
1012,0.97,6456.249,6457.484,On how that can be spent.,120,,
1013,0.97,6457.484,6461.988,"And we will come to you with a spend plan, soon.",120,,
1014,0.97,6461.988,6466.56,Duwamish Valley is an ongoing coordination.,120,,
1015,0.97,6466.56,6470.897,We work with multiple environments.,120,,
1016,0.97,6470.897,6477.404,"Primary leads that we coordinate with, public utilities.",120,,
1017,0.97,6477.404,6483.91,City light and King County on that work.,120,,
1018,0.97,6483.91,6511.104,"I mentioned equitable transit Riented development strategy and our team works with long- range and demographics data team to keep updating equity indicators report and participant research program that would become the report, monitoring how equitable our policy outcomes are.",120,,
1019,0.97,6511.104,6514.341,So I know there is a lot there.,120,,
1020,0.97,6514.341,6524.117,Those are kind of the highlights and I will leave time for questions.,120,,
1021,0.97,6524.117,6532.025,"Thank you, director Assefa.",121,,
1022,0.97,6532.025,6535.862,"I have a couple of questions on your slides, so if you keep them up that would be great.",121,,
1023,0.97,6535.862,6544.638,"I know that we have 10 minutes left with Councilmember Juarez, do you have questions?",121,,
1024,0.97,6544.638,6545.071,"No, okay.",121,,
1025,0.97,6545.071,6548.174,This is one year of your and your teams work.,121,,
1026,0.97,6548.174,6558.385,"Five years of your work has reshaped our city in incredibly positive and important ways, so highlighting this was one years worth of work.",121,,
1027,0.97,6558.385,6559.853,Doing just amazing things in our city.,121,,
1028,0.97,6559.853,6575.669,"On slide six, Land-Use policy, I don't expect you to have these numbers on hand, but is there a way of knowing what portion are being developed using one of these Preapproved plans or taking advantage of the universe that you mentioned?",121,,
1029,0.97,6575.669,6581.775,We are working with SBC I on that.,122,,
1030,0.97,6581.775,6585.011,I don't have the latest numbers.,122,,
1031,0.97,6585.011,6585.879,My team is coordinating.,122,,
1032,0.97,6585.879,6588.715,I'm not sure we have the numbers.,122,,
1033,0.97,6588.715,6589.916,We can get it to you.,122,,
1034,0.97,6589.916,6593.987,It is still early.,122,,
1035,0.97,6593.987,6596.99,We monitor applications that are coming in.,122,,
1036,0.97,6596.99,6604.531,But we can get to the latest date on that.,122,,
1037,0.97,6604.531,6608.802,I'm not sure if Nathan is on the call.,122,,
1038,0.97,6608.802,6610.036,Following up later is fine.,123,,
1039,0.97,6610.036,6619.746,I just want to highlight that this is a way we can expedient people getting through the pipeline and lower the costs.,123,,
1040,0.97,6619.746,6627.854,"On the slide titled urban design, I guess it is not so much a question as more of a comment, talking about Uplifting all of the great work that you did with that feasibility study.",123,,
1041,0.97,6627.854,6650.644,"It is clear that it is feasible to lead I-5 . The report you provided was really helpful, understanding we can do public space, private real estate, a mixture of both and it really frames the conversation for us to be able to move into the future.",123,,
1042,0.97,6650.644,6664.057,"We know cities all across the nation are using lids just for public space or in D.C., they have actually built buildings on top of the freeway and we have experience in Seattle with work on the Montlake lid.",123,,
1043,0.97,6664.057,6665.392,It is currently under construction.,123,,
1044,0.97,6665.392,6667.694,Go take a look.,123,,
1045,0.97,6667.694,6671.965,Hopefully it is coming to I-5 near you.,123,,
1046,0.97,6671.965,6676.002,"So, no questions, just thank you.",123,,
1047,0.97,6676.002,6694.754,"On slide 13, community planning, can you provide, you may have mentioned this, but more clearly, what is the status of the downtown initiative, given the focus on the downtown recovery district.",123,,
1048,0.97,6694.754,6697.123,You expect more work on the initiative in 2021?,123,,
1049,0.97,6697.123,6703.43,"That work is given a great roadmap for short-term, Midterm, long-term access.",124,,
1050,0.97,6703.43,6712.605,"And this is the right time to actually use that and the team is really focusing on downtown recovery, for example.",124,,
1051,0.97,6712.605,6718.912,Especially around public spaces that are identified in that document.,124,,
1052,0.97,6718.912,6722.949,That would be a roadmap.,124,,
1053,0.97,6722.949,6733.66,The downtown transportation alliance that includes the downtown Seattle Association and other transportation agencies.,124,,
1054,0.97,6733.66,6749.976,That group is also using that document to really t up coordination on transportation and public space ideas that have been developed in imagining downtown.,124,,
1055,0.97,6749.976,6762.789,"So yes, that work would help inform a lot, especially on recovery in the immediate sense.",124,,
1056,0.97,6762.789,6763.189,Please.,125,,
1057,0.97,6763.189,6764.524,I apologize for interrupting.,126,,
1058,0.97,6764.524,6769.696,I was going to add to that.,126,,
1059,0.97,6769.696,6803.396,"You know we have had a couple of great conversations recently about greater downtown and how we move toward recovery this year and I am very much looking forward to working with the agency partnership, regarding how we communicate how city of Seattle and downtown are still open for business and what that communications plan evolves into.",126,,
1060,0.97,6803.396,6824.117,"And I think, you know, the point we have talked about with downtown, regarding Multimodal hubs and all of the great characteristics of our different neighborhoods will certainly inform our work as we move deeper into the year.",126,,
1061,0.97,6824.117,6825.451,"Wonderful, thank you.",127,,
1062,0.97,6825.451,6832.258,"And Lastly, slide 14.",127,,
1063,0.97,6832.258,6836.062,You shared quite a bit about work in 2021 toward equitable zoning strategies.,127,,
1064,0.97,6836.062,6843.169,Are there any finer points you want to put on this?,127,,
1065,0.97,6843.169,6846.072,"So, the equitable zoning strategies, we are demonstrating the concept and idea.",128,,
1066,0.97,6846.072,6846.873,There are two parts.,128,,
1067,0.97,6846.873,6855.515,"As we look at the area planning and the 14 station areas, there is typical transit oriented development.",128,,
1068,0.97,6855.515,6862.288,"Planning focuses on maximizing density, where the stations are, because of the investment.",128,,
1069,0.97,6862.288,6879.973,"We want to put another lens on that and ask the question, who is going to benefit from that density and are there opportunities there for land ownership for other engagement or small businesses within the Bipoc Comunity, for example?",128,,
1070,0.97,6879.973,6893.319,"And over the years, and recently, we have heard from primarily Bipoc developers or organizations that want to do development, but there are certain barriers still embedded there.",128,,
1071,0.97,6893.319,6910.47,So we're connecting data and information around that and we will be helping to sort of think about what barriers we need to remove and address and what they are calling equitable zoning.,128,,
1072,0.97,6910.47,6922.448,"As you know very well, we learned the spotlight in 2020 has been the impact that zoning regulation has done to impact Bipoc communities.",128,,
1073,0.97,6922.448,6930.189,This is an opportunity I think.,128,,
1074,0.97,6930.189,6940.867,This is a transformation plan and this is a time to really think about how we reverse those types of issues in my team is working on that.,128,,
1075,0.97,6940.867,6942.702,"By the way, thank you for your comment.",128,,
1076,0.97,6942.702,6944.771,I have to say I have some of the best team.,128,,
1077,0.97,6944.771,6951.477,"That is why all that work that we see, ideas, develop.",128,,
1078,0.97,6951.477,6959.185,"I just sit around and make sure they are supported, so most of the credit really goes to them.",128,,
1079,0.97,6959.185,6967.06,"The mark of a true leader, being able to give your team the support they need, make sure things are getting done and recognizing the team.",129,,
1080,0.97,6967.06,6972.398,"Thank you, director Assefa.",129,,
1081,0.97,6972.398,6983.776,"Colleagues, just since we are on the slide calling up the Maritime industrial strategies, I always put Maritime first.",129,,
1082,0.97,6983.776,6986.012,"We don't need to get into it, just good work there.",129,,
1083,0.97,6986.012,6987.814,I am excited to see that come forward.,129,,
1084,0.97,6987.814,6994.52,"Colleagues, any other questions for director Assefa and deputy director Quirindongo?",129,,
1085,0.97,6994.52,6996.022,Did I get it?,129,,
1086,0.97,6996.022,6997.19,Close.,130,,
1087,0.97,6997.19,7000.793,"Quirindongo, thank you.",130,,
1088,0.97,7000.793,7005.498,"O, vice chair Mosqueda.",131,,
1089,0.97,7005.498,7010.336,Think you very much and it is great to see you.,132,,
1090,0.97,7010.336,7011.604,"Congratulations, as well.",132,,
1091,0.97,7011.604,7017.043,Thank you for your presentation.,132,,
1092,0.97,7017.043,7020.747,I look forward to working with you and thank you for all of your work over the years.,132,,
1093,0.97,7020.747,7026.319,I do have a few follow-up questions.,132,,
1094,0.97,7026.319,7033.126,I wanted to ask about if there are any updates on Faith-Based organizational housing Land-Use changes that we had been working on with you all.,132,,
1095,0.97,7033.126,7043.87,Waiting to see how we can help support more construction of affordable housing on property owned by faith community organizations.,132,,
1096,0.97,7043.87,7045.004,"Sure, that is moving forward.",133,,
1097,0.97,7045.004,7053.846,March 8 we published the environmental determinant of significance.,133,,
1098,0.97,7053.846,7062.989,"This is whether the zoning changes that are proposed, they range from 1 to 3 story capacity.",133,,
1099,0.97,7062.989,7067.393,"For religious owned properties, based on the legislation from last year.",133,,
1100,0.97,7067.393,7067.994,2019.,133,,
1101,0.97,7067.994,7088.214,"So, March 29, the public review comments will be completed and if there is no challenge, we expect, soon after that, some legislation.",133,,
1102,0.97,7088.214,7091.617,Excellent.,134,,
1103,0.97,7091.617,7092.485,"Okay, a follow-up question.",135,,
1104,0.97,7092.485,7097.123,"Please, take it away.",136,,
1105,0.97,7097.123,7119.846,"So, I appreciate that, I look forward to working with you on that and I know that many Iterations of policy changes have had to come together at the state and local level to help make sure that we could advance opportunity for Faith-Based community organizations to be able to advance a more affordable housing option, so I look forward to that conversation.",137,,
1106,0.97,7119.846,7128.421,"The other thing I am looking forward to, probably no Úsurprise, the racial equity Toolkit analysis that we put into statute and, I believe, 2018.",137,,
1107,0.97,7128.421,7149.275,"The importance of that Toolkit analysis was to look at the urban village strategies and to better understand whether there was an impact, especially for communities of color and in terms of displacement and excluding communities from being able to live across our cities.",137,,
1108,0.97,7149.275,7158.05,"We had expected there to be a presentation next month and that, I think, was pushed to May.",137,,
1109,0.97,7158.05,7174.333,"Obviously everything has been pushed a little bit because of Covid, but this is so important and so many community members have been waiting for this, similar to other cities as they think about more inclusive zoning strategies.",137,,
1110,0.97,7174.333,7182.208,Can you give us a sense of when the Toolkit analysis on our urban village strategy will be presented?,137,,
1111,0.97,7182.208,7194.32,"Sure, so the staff is been working with the consultant, policy link, that was hired last year to develop the analysis, as well as recommendation.",138,,
1112,0.97,7194.32,7203.529,They were paused for a bit last year because of the pandemic.,138,,
1113,0.97,7203.529,7205.398,Part of their work has to do with community engagement.,138,,
1114,0.97,7205.398,7206.999,They have now initiated that again.,138,,
1115,0.97,7206.999,7217.343,And they are preparing reports and we will come and report to you in May.,138,,
1116,0.97,7217.343,7223.816,Last December we came and reported on the Timeline.,138,,
1117,0.97,7223.816,7233.426,Obviously we are ready to come to you in May with the findings on that.,138,,
1118,0.97,7233.426,7249.475,"And as I mentioned earlier, it would be Foundational in terms of informing public conversation as well, throughout the year, around what issues need to be Teed up.",138,,
1119,0.97,7249.475,7253.279,"That work, we will share with you in May.",138,,
1120,0.97,7253.279,7255.081,"Okay, thank you so much.",139,,
1121,0.97,7255.081,7260.72,"For everybody, I am so excited about that.",139,,
1122,0.97,7260.72,7264.49,I'm so thankful for the work you are doing and that is sort of the last question I have.,139,,
1123,0.97,7264.49,7277.303,"The community engagement strategies that your office leads on, they have been initiated or picked back up and that is also true of the comprehensive plan process.",139,,
1124,0.97,7277.303,7282.174,"We are still expecting all of those conversations to happen, to begin in July.",139,,
1125,0.97,7282.174,7282.675,"Okay, excellent.",139,,
1126,0.97,7282.675,7288.014,Deputy director Quirindongo and also director Assefa.,139,,
1127,0.97,7288.014,7291.751,It has been wonderful to work with you and great to see you today.,139,,
1128,0.97,7291.751,7298.824,Thank you.,140,,

1130,0.97,7299.625,7303.529,She is better at a lot of things than I am.,141,,
1131,0.97,7303.529,7304.73,Pronunciation is absolutely one of them.,141,,
1132,0.97,7304.73,7311.27,"So, thank you, and my apologies, deputy director, again.",141,,
1133,0.97,7311.27,7313.839,"Colleagues, any final questions?",141,,
1134,0.97,7313.839,7325.851,"Seeing none, again, director Assefa, heartbroken receiving the news.",141,,
1135,0.97,7325.851,7335.161,I do want to thank you again for joining us today and everything you have done over the past five years.,141,,
1136,0.97,7335.161,7338.764,"You are a nationally recognized planner and have worked all over the country in boulder, San Francisco, Chicago.",141,,
1137,0.97,7338.764,7342.968,I feel so lucky that you chose Seattle.,141,,
1138,0.97,7342.968,7347.773,We are so lucky to have a nationally recognized planner.,141,,
1139,0.97,7347.773,7355.281,"Our built environment creates the reality in which we live and in so many ways, so thank you, thank you, thank you.",141,,
1140,0.97,7355.281,7361.987,"Thank you very much, I appreciate it.",142,,

1142,0.97,7365.658,7375.801,"It is a briefing from the Department and I will mention for the record, Councilmember Juarez is excused.",143,,
1143,0.97,7375.801,7386.178,"Our briefing, will you please read the item into the record.",143,,
1144,0.97,7386.178,7388.481,"Item three, Seattle Department of construction and inspections annual report.",144,,
1145,0.97,7388.481,7393.018,"Thank you, we are joined by director Nathan Torgelson from Sdci.",145,,
1146,0.97,7393.018,7393.486,Welcome back.,145,,
1147,0.97,7393.486,7400.893,"Always a pleasure to have you and the floor is yours, take it away.",145,,
1148,0.97,7400.893,7401.827,"Thank you, Council members.",146,,
1149,0.97,7401.827,7409.034,It is my pleasure to be here this morning and I am going to share my screen.,146,,
1150,0.97,7409.034,7414.807,Can you all see that?,146,,
1151,0.97,7414.807,7415.641,"Yes, we can.",147,,
1152,0.97,7415.641,7423.149,It is not in full view.,147,,
1153,0.97,7423.149,7424.517,I will get there.,148,,
1154,0.97,7424.517,7427.353,Awesome.,149,,
1155,0.97,7427.353,7433.659,Let's see.,150,,
1156,0.97,7433.659,7439.999,Thanks for your patience.,150,,
1157,0.97,7450.075,7460.553,Did you do Slideshow at top?,151,,
1158,0.97,7464.056,7464.79,Slideshow.,151,,
1159,0.97,7464.79,7466.392,I am looking for that.,152,,
1160,0.97,7466.392,7475.768,I have this bar on the top that I have to get rid of.,152,,
1161,0.97,7475.768,7476.368,It is hiding.,152,,
1162,0.97,7476.368,7478.204,"'s to go to the right, next to animation.",153,,
1163,0.97,7478.204,7479.772,"Keep going, keep going.",153,,
1164,0.97,7479.772,7481.373,To the right.,153,,
1165,0.97,7481.373,7487.713,Slideshow.,153,,
1166,0.97,7487.713,7497.69,"Bear with me, I've got a bar that is over the top of the Powerpoint, so I can't see it.",154,,
1167,0.97,7497.69,7499.525,"No problem, I will direct your mouse.",155,,
1168,0.97,7499.525,7501.927,If you move just slightly tear right.,155,,
1169,0.97,7501.927,7502.528,Up.,155,,
1170,0.97,7502.528,7510.035,Up just a little bit further.,155,,
1171,0.97,7510.035,7516.742,Right there and then tear right.,155,,
1172,0.97,7516.742,7522.681,To your right.,155,,
1173,0.97,7539.265,7541.867,Sorry about this.,156,,
1174,0.97,7541.867,7549.675,No problem.,157,,
1175,0.97,7549.675,7563.889,"I've got a bar at the top that says view, stop Video, participants, and I am trying to get that off, so I can see the bar.",158,,
1176,0.97,7563.889,7570.996,I can actually see the screen pretty well.,159,,
1177,0.97,7570.996,7572.398,You can see it just fine?,160,,
1178,0.97,7572.398,7572.665,Great.,160,,
1179,0.97,7572.665,7576.902,"I can see the side panels, but I think it is still visible.",161,,
1180,0.97,7576.902,7578.304,Should I just start?,162,,
1181,0.97,7578.304,7583.609,Sorry about that.,162,,
1182,0.97,7583.609,7585.044,"Vice chair Mosqueda, another asset.",163,,
1183,0.97,7585.044,7588.08,Twice in two minutes.,163,,
1184,0.97,7588.08,7589.615,Please feel free to take it away.,163,,
1185,0.97,7589.615,7593.986,"Sure, my apologies.",164,,
1186,0.97,7593.986,7595.587,Just a reminder of Sdci's purpose and values.,164,,
1187,0.97,7595.587,7603.896,"Our purpose is helping people build a safe, livable, and inclusive Seattle.",164,,
1188,0.97,7603.896,7608.033,"Our values, equity, respect, quality, integrity and service.",164,,
1189,0.97,7608.033,7610.736,I want to highlight our core value of equity.,164,,
1190,0.97,7610.736,7621.947,We lead and now more than ever we are really focusing on looking at permitting through a race and social justice lens.,164,,
1191,0.97,7621.947,7637.229,We recognize that all of our applicants don't have the resources to hire consultants and Land-Use attorneys and we have a complicated and robust permitting process.,164,,
1192,0.97,7637.229,7642.468,"So we have spent extra time this year, helping some of our applicants.",164,,
1193,0.97,7642.468,7662.187,"We had an immigrant and refugee community center and also Bipoc organization that was establishing a community center and we spent time with them, ensuring that they would have a successful permitting process.",164,,
1194,0.97,7662.187,7675.2,I am going to focus on our priorities for 2021 and also touch upon some of the things that happened in our Department in 2020.,164,,
1195,0.97,7675.2,7685.744,So we have spent and will continue to spend a lot of time implementing tenant service grants to tenant service organizations.,164,,
1196,0.97,7685.744,7693.085,We have been working on an outreach plan to prepare tenants for the expiration of the Eviction moratorium.,164,,
1197,0.97,7693.085,7706.331,We have been carrying forward best practices adopted during Covid and seeing how we can continue some of those practices when we returned to In-Person service.,164,,
1198,0.97,7706.331,7708.2,We are always working on streamlining our processes.,164,,
1199,0.97,7708.2,7733.258,We have been working on creating a cross departmental permit system Governance model and also continuing to work with partners to modify the state rules that apply to homeless facilities.,164,,
1200,0.97,7733.258,7738.33,"So, before I get into some of the priorities, I want to talk about how our Department has shifted resources to address Covid.",164,,
1201,0.97,7738.33,7757.883,"The majority of our staff are now working virtually and as you recall, in Mid-2018, we Transitioned our permitting process to a different system.",164,,
1202,0.97,7757.883,7765.39,"That Rollout was rocky, but certainly now that has been an incredible tool during Covid.",164,,
1203,0.97,7765.39,7771.43,Applicants are able to submit their applications virtually.,164,,
1204,0.97,7771.43,7777.302,"We are able to review them virtually and issue permit, virtually.",164,,
1205,0.97,7777.302,7785.711,I do want to recognize that we still have staff that are coming into the office every day.,164,,
1206,0.97,7785.711,7790.115,"For example, our Land-Use information Bulletin, that goes out twice per week, has to be done in the office.",164,,
1207,0.97,7790.115,7803.395,In the field every day . Ectors construction inspectors.,164,,
1208,0.97,7803.395,7818.21,We have been able to resume periodic inspections for boilers and elevators within occupied buildings and our compliance staff are out investigating code compliance complaints.,164,,
1209,0.97,7818.21,7825.951,"We have not been going into homes as part of code compliance, unless it is an emergency situation, so some of those issues have been on hold.",164,,
1210,0.97,7825.951,7837.329,"Some of our inspections have been paused, for example nursing homes and assisted nursing facilities, but we look forward to resuming those, post pandemic.",164,,
1211,0.97,7837.329,7845.037,We provide comprehensive assistance to tenants and landlords during this very difficult time period.,164,,
1212,0.97,7845.037,7852.144,"We have worked with the Mayor's office, the office of emergency management, and Sdot, to Prioritize response efforts.",164,,
1213,0.97,7852.144,7867.993,"This has involved hospital worker parking and permitting for Covid related facilities, whether it was medical clinics, testing facilities, or research facilities.",164,,
1214,0.97,7867.993,7868.794,It has not been perfect.,164,,
1215,0.97,7868.794,7885.611,"I am first to acknowledge that, but we have been able to maintain a fairly high level of customer service through our Online question and answer, coaching appointments, and the electronic plan review and issuance.",164,,
1216,0.97,7885.611,7891.083,So let's talk about tenant outreach and engagement.,164,,
1217,0.97,7891.083,7902.628,We have been developing a Proactive outreach plan to prepare tenants for a future expiration of the Eviction moratorium.,164,,
1218,0.97,7902.628,7916.541,That may or may not expire at the end of March and we continue to focus tenant service grants on assisting tenants facing Eviction.,164,,
1219,0.97,7916.541,7931.189,We have just awarded $1.3 million in tenant services grants with an emphasis on Covid response and recovery and we will have another round of funding in the next couple of months.,164,,
1220,0.97,7931.189,7936.428,I want to thank Council for the additional resources that they provided for that as part of the budget process.,164,,
1221,0.97,7936.428,7944.036,We have hired additional staff for our technical assistance group.,164,,
1222,0.97,7944.036,7960.419,We just hired a new staff person in that group who is on board and we are in the middle of interviewing for a technical position in our compliance center.,164,,
1223,0.97,7960.419,7961.987,That interviewing is happening this week.,164,,
1224,0.97,7961.987,7967.259,"That staff member, was that from a Council funded position?",165,,
1225,0.97,7967.259,7970.362,Correct.,166,,
1226,0.97,7970.362,7970.962,Thank you.,167,,
1227,0.97,7970.962,7978.603,"Our renting in Seattle Website is up and running and I encourage Councilmembers to take a look at that, if you have not already.",168,,
1228,0.97,7978.603,7984.576,"We have a variety of Infographics that also provide additional, helpful information.",168,,
1229,0.97,7984.576,7995.12,We have done a ton of training and technical assistance events to Grantees and community partners and landlords.,168,,
1230,0.97,7995.12,8000.225,"Those events have been happening, virtually.",168,,
1231,0.97,8000.225,8009.234,"Again, this has been a great collaboration with the Seattle office of civil rights, the office of immigrant refugee affairs.",168,,
1232,0.97,8009.234,8032.224,"So, another priority is to maintain innovative practices and to carry forward some of the best practices we have adopted during Covid and to develop a process to resume our standard services, including income inspections, when we get out of Covid.",168,,
1233,0.97,8032.224,8051.977,"So, we want to continue building on the success of virtual public meetings, including design review meetings and I want to thank the Council for their swift legislation to allow us to get back to design review meetings.",168,,
1234,0.97,8051.977,8063.655,"One of the things that we are looking at right now is that when we do go back to the office and are able to have In- person meetings, how should we handle design review?",168,,
1235,0.97,8063.655,8069.694,Should we go back to all In- person meetings?,168,,
1236,0.97,8069.694,8077.402,Do we continue with virtual only meetings or do we have some kind of hybrid process?,168,,
1237,0.97,8077.402,8087.379,A lot of the designated locations for our design review meetings do not have technology built in and that is a very expensive proposition.,168,,
1238,0.97,8087.379,8094.619,"Another option would be to have all of our design review meetings in one location, where technology can be built-in easily.",168,,
1239,0.97,8094.619,8104.629,"We know that also presents challenges, because there are multiple design review meetings going on at different locations.",168,,
1240,0.97,8104.629,8107.432,So it is something we are taking a very close look at.,168,,
1241,0.97,8107.432,8119.544,"In January and February of this year, we had to virtual Sdci home fares and that drew over 500 people.",168,,
1242,0.97,8119.544,8121.246,We were delighted with the response and participation of the public.,168,,
1243,0.97,8121.246,8135.06,"We had organized presentations on such topics as earthquake preparedness, landslide preparedness, and how to permit a dwelling unit or an attached dwelling unit.",168,,
1244,0.97,8135.06,8149.875,We also had an open Q & amp; a on a variety of topics.,168,,
1245,0.97,8149.875,8153.178,In the past those of been in person at a South Seattle and North Seattle location.,168,,
1246,0.97,8153.178,8161.286,"By having the program virtually, we attracted a lot more people.",168,,
1247,0.97,8161.286,8162.487,About double the number of people.,168,,
1248,0.97,8162.487,8165.757,"Something to think about in the future, perhaps we do one in person and one virtual.",168,,
1249,0.97,8165.757,8172.597,We keep using and improving our virtual inspection and plan review tools.,168,,
1250,0.97,8172.597,8178.17,"Virtual inspections is something we stepped up this year, given Covid.",168,,
1251,0.97,8178.17,8190.282,"It works especially well for some types of inspections, especially electrical inspections and for other inspections it is not going to work as well, for example Conveyance and elevators.",168,,
1252,0.97,8190.282,8193.985,So something we continue to look at.,168,,
1253,0.97,8193.985,8216.541,"Another thing we have done this year's we started discussions with the Seattle public library about the possibility of having staff, one day or two days per week, at a North or South Seattle location, to help the public.",168,,
1254,0.97,8216.541,8221.613,"And so the public doesn't necessarily have to come down and pay for parking, et cetera.",168,,
1255,0.97,8221.613,8229.754,"As we look to the future, one of the things that we are looking at is having a virtual applicant service center.",168,,
1256,0.97,8229.754,8239.264,"Again, other than having people have to come downtown for Face- To-Face communication.",168,,
1257,0.97,8239.264,8242.334,We have also been working on a variety of tools that will improve the permit process.,168,,
1258,0.97,8242.334,8252.877,"We are Piloting a tool which allows applicants and staff, in real time, together, to make corrections to plans.",168,,
1259,0.97,8252.877,8262.554,That is a fantastic tool that should reduce the number of correction cycles and we are also working on something called Chatbot.,168,,
1260,0.97,8262.554,8279.004,"Like when you get Online and talk to someone, through Alaska Airlines, for example, and having that available to members of the public who want to talk with us.",168,,
1261,0.97,8279.004,8291.916,Let's talk about permitting changes and ways we are looking at streamlining the permitting process and making reductions in permitting times.,168,,
1262,0.97,8291.916,8303.228,"Before Covid happened, the Mayor had put together two, citywide, task force advisory boards.",168,,
1263,0.97,8303.228,8308.933,One Unaffordable and middle income housing and one on small business.,168,,
1264,0.97,8308.933,8332.824,"I want to mention that in August of 2020, the Mayor announced a funding round for permanent supportive housing, highlighting six projects and gave me very aggressive Timelines on permitting and to get those supporting housing projects Online, quickly.",168,,
1265,0.97,8332.824,8352.844,I have been facilitating the monthly meeting with all of the players with the permit processes and multiple city departments and also King County and I feel that has been a very successful process.,168,,
1266,0.97,8352.844,8360.552,"We meet once per month and problem solve on the spot, various issues whether it is the permitting process or Seattle public utilities on plumbing permits.",168,,
1267,0.97,8360.552,8361.152,That has been great.,168,,
1268,0.97,8361.152,8371.696,I also wanted to recognize Councilmember Lewis's legislation to help with permanent support of housing.,168,,
1269,0.97,8371.696,8379.37,"This will exempt the design review process for those projects that have Wraparound supportive services on site, so that is important.",168,,
1270,0.97,8379.37,8392.817,Also another technology adoption we have made is that the Seattle building code now allows cross laminated timber buildings up to 18 stories high.,168,,
1271,0.97,8392.817,8410.335,"This is more efficient and a less expensive construction method than steel form construction, so we are starting to see some of the first applications come in for cross laminated timber.",168,,
1272,0.97,8410.335,8415.44,We have been Partnering with the office of economic development to prepare for more changes to small business spaces.,168,,
1273,0.97,8415.44,8427.986,We are going to be meeting with Councilmember Lewis later this week to talk about how we can improve the process.,168,,
1274,0.97,8427.986,8436.528,We've been working with the office of economic development on small businesses who are interested in moving into spaces and really working with them before they sign that lease.,168,,
1275,0.97,8436.528,8451.976,"Sometimes there are challenges for small businesses who will sign a lease and then discover, in order to make this space available, for my business, I am going to have to make a much bigger investment than I anticipated.",168,,
1276,0.97,8451.976,8453.578,So we are really trying to improve that.,168,,
1277,0.97,8453.578,8482.807,"We have a small business liaison in our Department to works with small businesses and I also want to mention that we have an arts liaison that works with our arts and cultural institutions in Seattle, recognizing that lease rates continue to increase in our city and we want to keep those businesses and institutions in our city.",168,,
1278,0.97,8482.807,8493.184,"Finally, on that last slide, too, director Assefa talked about this a lot, the detached accessory dwelling unit project.",168,,
1279,0.97,8493.184,8504.996,We have 10 Preapproved plans and our goal is that those projects can get through our system into to six weeks.,168,,
1280,0.97,8504.996,8522.647,"We will follow up with you to see how many applications we have in the system right now, but we are really excited about all of this and creating additional detached dwelling units in our city.",168,,
1281,0.97,8522.647,8528.119,"Cross departmental permitting, our goal is to create a model with Seattle I.T.",168,,
1282,0.97,8528.119,8529.254,To improve the customer experience.,168,,
1283,0.97,8529.254,8537.662,The idea is that an applicant could do all of their transactions in one place.,168,,
1284,0.97,8537.662,8539.497,Have a single Sign-On to the city of Seattle.,168,,
1285,0.97,8539.497,8548.973,"We would give them a to do list, a shopping cart to pay outstanding fees.",168,,
1286,0.97,8548.973,8553.811,They would get renewal reminders if they have annual permits that they need to get and it would be a common scheduling platform.,168,,
1287,0.97,8553.811,8564.489,We are also working on improvements to allow a much easier experience for members of the public to submit public comments.,168,,
1288,0.97,8564.489,8577.702,"Many of you are familiar with our shaping Seattle Website, where you go on to the Website, you see a map and dots.",168,,
1289,0.97,8577.702,8580.905,You can click on the DOT to see the status of the permit.,168,,
1290,0.97,8580.905,8584.309,You can see the design review packet if there is a project at that site.,168,,
1291,0.97,8584.309,8599.824,"We will soon be Piloting a similar map for code complaints, so people can look up the status of code complaints in the neighborhood and where that is within the process.",168,,
1292,0.97,8599.824,8620.745,"As far as the system integration I mentioned earlier, we are excited that Sdot and the Department of neighborhoods migration is in process, so that includes Street use permits and Department of neighborhoods includes their landmarks review.",168,,
1293,0.97,8620.745,8628.82,Modification of state super rolls.,168,,
1294,0.97,8628.82,8638.963,We had a goal this year to continue working with Oir and other partners to modify the rules that apply to homeless facilities.,168,,
1295,0.97,8638.963,8655.279,"We were working on allowing these facilities to buy press the process, so that we could get shelter in self safe places, permitted faster.",168,,
1296,0.97,8655.279,8662.587,"Like many good bills, this failed to advance this session, unfortunately.",168,,
1297,0.97,8662.587,8676.801,We will continue to work with Oir to make the goals of this legislation a reality and help the people who are the most vulnerable in our community to have a safe place to go.,168,,
1298,0.97,8676.801,8683.307,"So, more work for us to do in this area.",168,,
1299,0.97,8683.307,8691.015,"One of the things that is not a new priority for our Department, but continues to be a priority and I know is very important to Councilmembers, is trees.",168,,
1300,0.97,8691.015,8698.389,We have been working very closely with Councilmember Strauss on tree legislation.,168,,
1301,0.97,8698.389,8702.627,We are about to award a contract with a consultant to help us to public outreach.,168,,
1302,0.97,8702.627,8711.235,We have heard a lot about trees from home developers and penthouse developers.,168,,
1303,0.97,8711.235,8727.618,"We have heard a lot about trees from strong tree advocates, but we want to make sure we get broad community input from various constituent groups and especially Bipoc communities, so that work will be underway soon.",168,,
1304,0.97,8727.618,8739.13,We have become much more efficient on following up with tree violations.,168,,
1305,0.97,8739.13,8754.378,"Councilmember Pedersen recently sent to an Email about an egregious tree cutting that happened in your district and we will be tripling the fine on that violation and going for a $100,000 fine.",168,,
1306,0.97,8754.378,8762.854,So we continue to work on trees and look forward to working with the Council on legislation.,168,,
1307,0.97,8762.854,8775.967,"Another area where we are working on climate change is in the newly adopted technical codes and again, I want to highlight the new energy code and thank you, Council, for your support on that.",168,,
1308,0.97,8775.967,8787.512,"That will go a long ways in fighting climate change, as we look at new construction and new buildings in the energy code provisions.",168,,
1309,0.97,8787.512,8802.56,"Finally, we continue to do a lot of work with Opcd and Sdot and other departments on sound transit, looking at potential code amendments and also at the permitting process.",168,,
1310,0.97,8806.13,8812.904,That concludes my presentation and I am happy to take,168,,
1311,0.97,8812.904,8814.338,"Thank you, director Torgelson.",169,,
1312,0.97,8814.338,8821.846,I know we were scheduled to have a full presentation on permitting and how we improve permitting time.,169,,
1313,0.97,8821.846,8826.017,I will have some questions for you after my colleagues about that.,169,,
1314,0.97,8826.017,8827.351,I do want to open it up.,169,,
1315,0.97,8827.351,8831.355,"Colleagues, questions at this time?",169,,
1316,0.97,8831.355,8832.256,"Councilmember Pedersen, take it away.",169,,
1317,0.97,8832.256,8844.001,"Thank you, director Torgelson for your presentation and I appreciate you mentioning the tree ordinance.",170,,
1318,0.97,8844.001,8858.583,"Some folks in the audience, and I did not see it in the Powerpoint presentation as a priority, so because we have that outstanding resolution and there was a lot of interest about trees during the budget process, I just look forward to seeing the actual legislation.",170,,
1319,0.97,8858.583,8861.052,Thank you.,170,,
1320,0.97,8861.052,8872.396,And I know that Sdci and Osc staff will be coming to the neighborhoods committee I believe with the first quarterly update.,171,,
1321,0.97,8872.396,8876.0,"Great, thank you.",172,,
1322,0.97,8876.0,8879.103,"Colleagues, other questions?",172,,
1323,0.97,8879.103,8892.516,"I was going to ask, director Torgelson, are there any updates on the work around solid waste?",172,,
1324,0.97,8892.516,8893.918,We are in the process.,173,,
1325,0.97,8893.918,8907.164,"We have actually hired a consultant who is looking at that, the existing regulations, and is doing outreach to various organizations.",173,,
1326,0.97,8907.164,8908.633,"As you know, it is a complex topic.",173,,
1327,0.97,8908.633,8912.436,So that work is underway.,173,,
1328,0.97,8912.436,8915.106,Thank you.,174,,
1329,0.97,8915.106,8929.387,"And you know, just kind of Piggybacking on the comments about trees, I am excited that I heard from both you and the deputy Mayor that we would be engaging in this work this year.",174,,
1330,0.97,8929.387,8934.959,I know you have already sent for approval.,174,,
1331,0.97,8934.959,8937.228,So you have done your work there.,174,,
1332,0.97,8937.228,8949.774,"And I just want to highlight the fact that it is important for us to create flexibility to be able to meet the floor area ratio, scale.",174,,
1333,0.97,8949.774,8956.547,And protect Canopies and engage our city and being able to grow more.,174,,
1334,0.97,8956.547,8970.061,"So I look forward to those suggestions and if you have any thoughts about what we need to do regarding flexibility for building buildings to protect trees, I am very interested.",174,,
1335,0.97,8970.061,8974.999,I do have a number of questions about permitting.,174,,
1336,0.97,8974.999,8979.67,Is this the best time?,174,,
1337,0.97,8979.67,8982.106,"I am happy to entertain them, if committee members have time.",175,,
1338,0.97,8982.106,8986.21,"I know we are running short on time, so I will try to be quick.",176,,
1339,0.97,8986.21,8993.684,"I know we had a presentation we will be seeing next month, because it was not quite ready.",176,,
1340,0.97,8993.684,9002.626,"Since I don't have a white board with me, I have some Post- it notes.",176,,
1341,0.97,9002.626,9004.195,"Can you hear me all right, still?",176,,
1342,0.97,9004.195,9007.098,Are you able to hear me from over here?,176,,
1343,0.97,9007.098,9007.331,Great.,176,,
1344,0.97,9007.331,9016.44,"So, one thing that was really important for me was, Accela.",176,,
1345,0.97,9016.44,9024.215,"It is so great we were able to put this program in place before Covid, because as I learned, before Accela, all of the permits were done on paper.",176,,
1346,0.97,9024.215,9034.058,So people submitting for a permit would have to come with multiple copies of their building plan to get Approva.,176,,
1347,0.97,9034.058,9038.763,"And director Torgelson, correct me if I am wrong.",176,,
1348,0.97,9038.763,9053.177,"Submit the permit, weight in the Queue and then you have to go to all of these different nodes along the way.",176,,
1349,0.97,9053.177,9064.989,These are all positions that folks in Sdci--is that Viewable?,176,,
1350,0.97,9064.989,9065.322,Close.,176,,
1351,0.97,9065.322,9088.746,"So something that is, you know, really important to understand, is there are so many different people that have to approve the permit and Furthermore, you've got folks outside of Sdci that also Hav to approve ended all comes back.",176,,
1352,0.97,9088.746,9089.58,Colorcode is not working.,176,,
1353,0.97,9089.58,9101.992,"If at that point, the permit has to be Re-Reviewed by the individual, they do not have to go back to the back of the Queue.",176,,
1354,0.97,9101.992,9116.207,"So this ability to have corrections, just in the permitting section, we are trying to move people as quickly as possible, once their permit is provided and is out.",176,,
1355,0.97,9116.207,9131.222,"Something that was really interesting, director Torgelson, that in each of these buckets, some of these teams have four people, some of them have 30.",176,,
1356,0.97,9131.222,9150.107,"These are highly trained people in our city, so if, for instance, if one person left a four person team it would leave a huge gap, but on a 30 person team it would not Impactedas much.",176,,
1357,0.97,9150.107,9162.286,"One thing helpful to hear from you and your team was that we have tried to use consultants to make approvals at these different nodes, but that sometimes doesn't work, because there is so much expertise required.",176,,
1358,0.97,9162.286,9174.865,So this is something where I am interested if there is an ability to create substitutes or a float team to make sure this process is moving forward.,176,,
1359,0.97,9174.865,9186.41,"Here you've got areas that are outside of Sdci, so if those departments aren't able to hire the correct people, it creates a backlog.",176,,
1360,0.97,9186.41,9196.42,"One thing that was important for me to hear was that you could fill the team back up here, but you would loose someone here.",176,,
1361,0.97,9196.42,9197.221,And loose somebody here.,176,,
1362,0.97,9197.221,9205.129,"I highlight this, as I want to be as supportive as possible of you and your team to make sure you have the staffing available.",176,,
1363,0.97,9205.129,9212.236,"Again, with all of those different nodes we are looking for different types of expertise.",176,,
1364,0.97,9212.236,9221.011,Hiring outside the Department doesn't always make sense.,176,,
1365,0.97,9221.011,9229.52,I'm just highlighting my support view there.,176,,
1366,0.97,9229.52,9243.334,"Important for us to note is you mentioned there are small, medium, and complex.",176,,
1367,0.97,9243.334,9244.969,Types of building permits you've got going on.,176,,
1368,0.97,9244.969,9253.477,"One thing I will do, a little graph that I was happy to hear about.",176,,
1369,0.97,9253.477,9264.188,Which is number of days and then years.,176,,
1370,0.97,9264.188,9274.365,"2009, 2020, and then, for review.",176,,
1371,0.97,9274.365,9293.717,"One thing that I heard from you during our presentation and our meeting is that over time and especially right as we were going into Accela, that transition created some bumps in the road.",176,,
1372,0.97,9293.717,9302.026,"What I heard from you is that you have addressed a lot of those bumps, so we are coming back down off that Bell curve.",176,,
1373,0.97,9302.026,9308.932,So the transition to Accela is hopefully behind us.,176,,
1374,0.97,9308.932,9314.905,The issues and variables that need to be addressed are definitely measured there.,176,,
1375,0.97,9314.905,9324.148,"So I'm excited for that and a Callout that if we had been in Covid without Accela, we would be in a really bad place.",176,,
1376,0.97,9324.148,9328.052,"So I want to call up the fact that we are on the right curve, the right size.",176,,
1377,0.97,9328.052,9332.122,It seems like we have a good understanding of how to improve programs and I will move this back now.,176,,
1378,0.97,9332.122,9344.668,I just want to call out and give you fair warning that what I am most interested in is how we can improve.,176,,
1379,0.97,9344.668,9361.552,"Sorry, a really clear thing I heard from you and your team is that there is not a defined goal of how long a permit should take for review, so for different people there are different expectations.",176,,
1380,0.97,9361.552,9377.401,"I want to be here, supportive of you and your team, making sure you have the resources you need to be successful, so I will be asking for what improvements we can make in the next month, what improvements can we make in the next quarter, and what improvements can we make this year?",176,,
1381,0.97,9377.401,9392.015,"We want to make sure everyone is Paddling the same direction with the same goal in mind and that you have all of the resources that you need to be successful, so I will save it for the official presentation next time.",176,,
1382,0.97,9392.015,9397.721,"Since I didn't get interrupted, it sounds like I did well in class and I'm excited to learn more.",176,,
1383,0.97,9397.721,9400.924,I will take a couple of quick points.,177,,
1384,0.97,9400.924,9412.336,"One of the tools we have is the ability to use contingent budget authority, where we can hire staff on a temporary basis, without having to go to Council for approval.",177,,
1385,0.97,9412.336,9416.74,That has been a very effective means to get staff hired quickly.,177,,
1386,0.97,9416.74,9438.929,"Those staff are not permanent, so it can be harder to recruit staff in those positions, but people in those temporary positions are very well positioned to take permanent positions and staff to retire or move on to other jobs.",177,,
1387,0.97,9438.929,9439.797,They are very competitive.,177,,
1388,0.97,9439.797,9441.165,So that has been a great tool.,177,,
1389,0.97,9441.165,9449.673,It is very difficult to predict what is going to happen to the economy and the last thing we want to do is hire staff and have to lay them off later.,177,,
1390,0.97,9449.673,9457.848,We do have goals around building permits for the initial round.,177,,
1391,0.97,9457.848,9462.052,"That is the most intense round, because that is the first time we are looking at permits.",177,,
1392,0.97,9462.052,9468.792,For simple permits those are things like additions and retaining walls.,177,,
1393,0.97,9468.792,9483.807,"We have a four week turnaround time for 90% of those permits and for more complex building permits, so that will be a Mixed-Use project that highlights structural alterations we have.",177,,
1394,0.97,9483.807,9492.182,"And for our master use permit, we have a goal of 120 days from permit to the Sdci decision.",177,,
1395,0.97,9492.182,9497.421,We have had a really hard time making that goal.,177,,
1396,0.97,9497.421,9498.622,We are successful for some.,177,,
1397,0.97,9498.622,9501.258,"You know, the code does keep getting more and more complicated.",177,,
1398,0.97,9501.258,9511.635,Mandatory housing Affordability is a very important check that involves some additional times.,177,,
1399,0.97,9511.635,9517.174,So we continue to address those turnaround times.,177,,
1400,0.97,9517.174,9523.046,Thank you and thank you for those Clarifications.,178,,
1401,0.97,9523.046,9526.516,Still I clearly have more to learn and I am excited for the next lesson in class.,178,,
1402,0.97,9526.516,9533.156,"Colleagues, any other questions on director Torgelson's report?",178,,
1403,0.97,9533.156,9538.462,I do also want to thank all of the inspectors who are going out into the field.,178,,
1404,0.97,9538.462,9563.453,"I know there are sites where they don't enter, because people aren't following Covid health guidelines and not only are the inspectors keeping our economy moving and ensuring permits out there and everyone is in compliance, they are also themselves on the front lines of the pandemic, so thank you to all of the inspectors.",178,,
1405,0.97,9563.453,9564.888,Thank you for recognizing them.,179,,
1406,0.97,9564.888,9570.56,I am not seeing questions from colleagues.,180,,
1407,0.97,9570.56,9571.795,"Thank you, director Torgelson for joining us.",180,,
1408,0.97,9571.795,9583.674,"I look forward to continuing to work with you and seeing you at our next committee meeting, where my awkward drawings are presented in a much more beautiful way.",180,,
1409,0.97,9583.674,9584.374,"So, thank you.",180,,
1410,0.97,9584.374,9590.213,"Thank you for your support and thank you, committee members.",181,,
1411,0.97,9590.213,9606.73,"So, moving on to the next item, I do want to recognize the fact that the clerk read the votes for bringing business home.",182,,
1412,0.97,9606.73,9623.547,"It was 4-1 and I am noting that the motion carries and shall be before the committee, before full Council, on the 15th or 22nd, depending on if they are able to suspend the rules or not.",182,,
1413,0.97,9623.547,9644.067,I do want to note that the inspectors from Sdci feel that they have code clarity at this time and are able to find people in compliance with the bill as written.,182,,
1414,0.97,9644.067,9645.535,So thank you for all of that.,182,,
1415,0.97,9645.535,9648.071,"Colleagues, any other items for the good of the order?",182,,
1416,0.97,9648.071,9655.779,"Seeing none, this concludes the Wednesday, March 10, meeting of the Land-Use and neighborhoods committee.",182,,
1417,0.97,9655.779,9658.281,"Our next meeting is March 24, starting at 9:30 A.M.",182,,
1418,0.97,9658.281,9669.893,Thank you for attending and we are adjourned.,182,,
