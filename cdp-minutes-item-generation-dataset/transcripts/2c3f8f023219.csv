35,0.97,378.778,380.847,We do have our last meeting today.,3,,
36,0.97,380.847,388.287,Before we get into the meeting I do want to note that this has been a deliberate are Ty process.,3,,
37,0.97,388.287,402.435,Lots of people have brought in their own perspectives and have contributed to making this budget I think one of the most progressive and robust conversations that we've had in recent history about where our dollars should be going and how we can be investing the public dollars differently.,3,,
38,0.97,402.435,412.979,"While we might not always agree, I think it's important to make sure we're encouraging folks to have a difference of opinion and still be respectful and understand where each ore is coming from.",3,,
39,0.97,412.979,417.083,This is true from those who are on the outside as well.,3,,
40,0.97,417.083,428.06,"I know a lot of folks have had their homes visited lately and I want to make sure folks know we can push hard, we can make each other uncomfortable and I think we do that on council as well.",3,,
41,0.97,428.06,439.839,"To folks in the community and at large, each of us are elected representatives with various constituents and we're trying to be responsive to each of those constituents and what's happened to some of our Council members is just not okay.",3,,
42,0.97,439.839,467.867,"The Council President has said it before, I know other Council members have as well and I have said it before as well and I just want to be clear as we head into the end of this year how much I appreciate the various strategies that have taken to the streets, I've participated in direct action many times myself before and we know that it is important to make sure that the voices are raised and that messages break through sometimes and that we hear folks.",3,,
43,0.97,467.867,484.217,"Some of the things we've seen at individual homes, like children being screamed at and people of color having their, women having Misogynistic messages written on their streets is not okay.",3,,
44,0.97,484.217,496.095,"I have not experienced any of that, all the conversations I've had with folks who visit me multiple times from different sides of the issues have been very respectful and I appreciate that.",3,,
45,0.97,496.095,501.467,And I recognize there's many different people doing different types of actions out there.,3,,
46,0.97,501.467,510.81,"And so as we go into having deliberations that can be tough, this is what we've been called to do is deliberate and make decisions on tough issues.",3,,
47,0.97,510.81,527.66,"I want to make sure that diversity of opinion is something that we value because if we start attacking folks who have children at home, women, people of color and sending Misogynistic messages or spray painting their streets, it could have the opposite effect.",3,,
48,0.97,527.66,529.328,It is not promoting democracy.,3,,
49,0.97,529.328,538.304,I don't want fewer people to run for office or step into these roles because they're worried about their family or their neighbors and things like that and we have to make tough decisions.,3,,
50,0.97,538.304,550.016,This moment is calling on us to make tough decisions and in ways this Council has stepped up to do that and I think the budget is a strong reflection of that and we'll continue working on it where we have fallen short.,3,,
51,0.97,550.016,550.283,We will.,3,,
52,0.97,550.283,569.235,"But I just want to make sure folks hear how important it is for us to continue to support the call for tough conversations and accountability, yes, but also recognizing we don't want to have an unintended consequence of discouraging people from running and being in these positions.",3,,
53,0.97,569.235,574.173,We all have constituencies to represent and we'll continue to push for change in various ways.,3,,
54,0.97,574.173,586.752,So I want to say I appreciate every single one of our colleagues and I do want to call out that bad behavior that folks have experienced and continue to work with you as we find solutions.,3,,
55,0.97,586.752,599.732,"There is direct action is very important in ways and as identify mentioned before, John Lewis, for example, I think he was 14 or 15 when he first began his forms of direct action and look where he led and so many people look back on his career.",3,,
56,0.97,599.732,620.186,"We have to do this in a way that is not discouraging people from ever wanting to speak their opinion or be in elected office and I appreciate that folks are taking to the streets, making tough conversations happen and I appreciate all of you and want to make sure you know I do not support that kind of engagement.",3,,
57,0.97,620.186,628.928,Today is the last meeting of the 2021 budget deliberations and we have a lot to do in front of us.,3,,
