38,0.97,294.594,298.097,Sleeping on the sidewalk with cardboard.,5,,
39,0.97,298.097,306.105,"Whatever they can do to keep the cold, wet off of them and the ground.",5,,
40,0.97,306.105,320.153,The village has allowed me to have security and a safe place to be with 24-hour security for myself to be able to keep my belongings and go look for work.,5,,
41,0.97,320.153,331.898,I seriously don't know as a single woman where I would be if I did not have that opportunity to have a safe place.,5,,
42,0.97,331.898,334.4,I am always fighting for the homelessness.,5,,
43,0.97,334.4,342.041,"Tiny House villages is a step towards, you know, giving folks a second chance at changing their lives.",5,,
44,0.97,342.041,359.926,And I don't know about all of the ordinances that are in place but I know that if some of them could be adjusted and moved and rearranged then certainly there could be room for more tiny House villages to be placed throughout the city.,5,,
45,0.97,359.926,360.226,Thank you.,5,,
46,0.97,360.226,365.531,I hope that it passes.,5,,

48,0.97,368.367,370.57,Sharon Lee followed by Peggy.,7,,
49,0.97,370.57,371.237,Good afternoon.,8,,
50,0.97,371.237,373.539,Sharon Lee director of low housing Institute.,8,,
51,0.97,373.539,384.684,I want to let people know of the overall number of people who have been helped by tiny houses.,8,,
52,0.97,384.684,387.22,"1,624 people have been housed in tiny houses.",8,,
53,0.97,387.22,387.62,[crowd APPLAUDS],8,,
54,0.97,387.62,397.53,"Of the people who moved out we have 740 have gotten housing, 740 people.",9,,
55,0.97,397.53,403.369,And 670 people have gotten income support.,9,,
56,0.97,403.369,408.808,"And, the majority of people, overwhelming majority obtained housing within the 1-6-Month period.",9,,
57,0.97,408.808,413.746,We really like the idea of tiny houses a bridge to long time housing.,9,,
58,0.97,413.746,426.325,"In terms of the amendment we are concerned that, I believe, safe parking in tent cities and tiny House villages are considered part of this covered by this ordinance.",9,,
59,0.97,426.325,456.522,"So we know that some private organizations and Nonprofits would like to have 5 or 6 cars, you know, people living in their cars that they could have a place that would be safe and we think that the Council should not reduce the number of possibilities or opportunities because it covers safe parking as well as tent cities if you are just limiting it, it is a different story.",9,,
60,0.97,456.522,474.173,Because safe parking is included overnight parking is an option case management in valuable but 27/7 security would not apply to overnight parking situation.,9,,
61,0.97,474.173,478.978,Our feeling is it makes sense if city funds are available.,9,,
62,0.97,478.978,484.417,Case management as well as needing the outcomes makes sense if the city is funding it.,9,,
63,0.97,484.417,511.911,We feel that the neighborhoods just about every neighborhood has homeless people so we would like to make sure that tiny House villages will be in all neighborhoods and not limit it to as one mile or only one Council district before you have to hit every district before you--thank you.,9,,
64,0.97,511.911,518.184,Your time has expired.,10,,
65,0.97,518.184,520.386,"Good evening, Councilmembers.",11,,
66,0.97,520.386,527.426,I would like to encourage you to vote on it as written and not the amendments.,12,,
67,0.97,527.426,531.464,I will tuck about amendments I find without merit.,12,,
68,0.97,531.464,540.406,Cutting the number from 40- 20 and there is no reason to do that when we know they are effective and safe and critical low needed.,13,,
69,0.97,540.406,548.748,"Amendment number 2, direct Hsd to establish the standards for operating tiny House villages.",13,,
70,0.97,548.748,554.587,Hsd so far showing they are incapable of administering a program.,13,,
71,0.97,554.587,574.24,"No grievance process, no process or bill of rights for the residents of tiny House villages and further more foolishly given the operation one operator a Monoply on operating tiny House villages, amendment number 3 is Requeering case man Annualers.",13,,
72,0.97,574.24,589.155,"I don't know if you realize this but there are few that are case managers at the tiny House villages, few, they would have to retrain them all or send them back to school if that were a requirement.",13,,
73,0.97,589.155,601.867,Really the biggest value in tiny House villages is that they are safer and healthier than Unsanction Encampments and there is really.,13,,
74,0.97,601.867,604.837,They are not the be all and end all.,13,,
75,0.97,604.837,608.808,They are value in and of themselves without that.,13,,
76,0.97,608.808,609.175,Thank you.,13,,
77,0.97,609.175,621.387,"And then the following folks will be Shawn Smith, followed by Alex and followed by Travis Johnson.",14,,

80,0.97,624.457,627.827,I am resident of Nichols North village.,15,,
81,0.97,627.827,636.369,I am here to speak to amendment 2. the clear policy set forth Hsd.,15,,
82,0.97,636.369,649.548,I think before doing that we first have to exam Hsd that has no grievance process at present.,15,,
83,0.97,649.548,660.559,A grievance must be established because they may be held accountable for holding on to the ordinance as written as they have done with the last ordinance.,15,,
84,0.97,660.559,669.869,It is vitally important to protect the rights of residents in those villages.,15,,
85,0.97,669.869,686.752,There have been several cases where the case managers are violating the rights of those villagers and those have been forwarded through the present grievance process and not addressed properly.,15,,
86,0.97,686.752,688.554,And there is no oversight.,15,,
87,0.97,688.554,709.341,"Please fix that before trying to fix this amendment or amend this ordinance, thank you.",15,,
88,0.97,709.341,712.044,"Good afternoon noon, Councilmembers.",16,,
89,0.97,712.044,712.445,I'm Alex Finch.,16,,
90,0.97,712.445,733.432,"I am going to try to appeal to your human nature today but because Seattle has three Forths of King County's population and as we have told you before, 112 have died last year.",16,,
91,0.97,733.432,734.133,They saved lives.,16,,
92,0.97,734.133,742.174,"So, when are you going to put human lives over spending.",16,,
93,0.97,742.174,748.714,When did putting a dollar amount on a human life become the standard?,16,,
94,0.97,748.714,757.423,Please just pass this ordinance as is so that way we can help save more lives.,16,,
95,0.97,757.423,759.425,Thank you.,16,,

101,0.97,791.724,805.871,Currently I am homeless and currently I have read all of the--I agree with Alex Finch about it should be as is.,18,,
102,0.97,805.871,806.906,It should not be amended.,18,,
103,0.97,806.906,808.207,That will be just corporate BS.,18,,
104,0.97,808.207,817.65,But that is all I could say on that for this time.,18,,
105,0.97,817.65,821.887,I do think that tiny houses save lives.,18,,
106,0.97,821.887,823.556,I have seen it done.,18,,
107,0.97,823.556,827.359,I have--I don't know about case managers.,18,,
108,0.97,827.359,835.701,I knew when I was in Georgetown I had a case manager I seen him once a week.,18,,
109,0.97,835.701,838.237,That was it.,18,,
110,0.97,838.237,842.908,At the end of the day I think tiny homes save lives on the streets.,18,,
111,0.97,842.908,843.909,I have seen the streets.,18,,
112,0.97,843.909,848.247,Believe me you would not want to be there right now.,18,,
113,0.97,848.247,852.685,"In the rain, in the cold, in with no home.",18,,
114,0.97,852.685,855.554,"Believe me, tiny House villages save lives.",18,,
115,0.97,855.554,876.108,And to say that only 20 is needed I think 150 is needed I have seen them.,18,,
116,0.97,876.108,880.045,We can go down there and people can sleep outside.,18,,
117,0.97,880.045,880.946,There is no room.,18,,
118,0.97,880.946,884.35,Tiny House villages are a must.,18,,
119,0.97,884.35,887.953,You would not like it sleeping outside in the cold.,18,,
120,0.97,887.953,889.588,It rains 40% of the time.,18,,
121,0.97,889.588,889.889,"But, yes.",18,,
122,0.97,889.889,903.302,That is all I have to say right now.,18,,

124,0.97,903.669,911.377,"Hi, I am Andrew, site coordinator for tiny House village.",19,,
125,0.97,911.377,919.418,Georgetown village on any given day six plus villagers and it takes referrals exclusively from the navigation team.,19,,
126,0.97,919.418,929.828,"The majority of our villagers suffered on the streets for many years, if not decades, and have layers of physical and emotional trauma.",19,,
127,0.97,929.828,939.138,The village offers safety and community to the most vulnerable on our streets and direct access to services through our Onsite case managers.,19,,
128,0.97,939.138,943.442,Our village enjoys the support of the greater Georgetown neighborhood.,19,,
129,0.97,943.442,946.345,We are thankful for the compassion they have shown us time and again.,19,,
130,0.97,946.345,957.356,The hardest part of working for the villages are the number of the people.,20,,
131,0.97,957.356,962.961,Asking daily about low they can be placed in a tiny house.,20,,
132,0.97,962.961,970.869,"Inquiries from opening of the police, local neighbors, service providers and people in crisis themselves.",20,,
133,0.97,970.869,971.17,Every day.,20,,
134,0.97,971.17,974.573,The only answer is to not give up and call again soon.,20,,

139,0.97,1001.2,1009.341,I would like to speak specifically to a couple proposed amendments.,20,,
140,0.97,1009.341,1019.585,"First, while the distribution, the current amendment creates barriers for Encampments and providing needed services for people across the city.",20,,
141,0.97,1019.585,1024.256,"Second, all of our City-Funded villages have case management.",20,,
142,0.97,1024.256,1026.692,Many operate successfully without 24/7 security.,20,,
143,0.97,1026.692,1031.797,It is more important to allocate this money for case management services.,20,,
144,0.97,1031.797,1041.807,"Finally, it is important to allow for an expanded definition.",20,,
145,0.97,1041.807,1048.547,Including the parking safe model.,20,,
146,0.97,1048.547,1052.418,Authorized Encampments to ensure Encampments for all.,20,,
147,0.97,1052.418,1056.722,I want to thank you for all of the work you have done.,20,,

151,0.97,1060.626,1062.227,Yes.,23,,
152,0.97,1062.227,1068.834,I am one of the leaders in Georgetown village.,23,,
153,0.97,1068.834,1070.536,Every day I turn people away.,23,,
154,0.97,1070.536,1072.771,More than I can count.,23,,
155,0.97,1072.771,1075.407,Sometimes it is 2 or 3 a day.,23,,
156,0.97,1075.407,1080.345,Everybody there has somebody they know who is living outside still.,23,,
157,0.97,1080.345,1087.519,"We have a few people that, you know, visit a lot.",23,,
158,0.97,1087.519,1102.468,If you can help me fund one more it is better than none at all.,23,,
159,0.97,1102.468,1103.535,That is about it.,24,,
160,0.97,1103.535,1105.27,Thank you very much for your public comment.,25,,
161,0.97,1105.27,1110.075,A lot of the questions and the concerns you raise I am sure will be addressed.,25,,
162,0.97,1110.075,1118.784,I encourage everyone to stick around for the rest of the agenda that we will now proceed to.,25,,
163,0.97,1118.784,1127.459,"That is to consider Council bill, 119656.",25,,
164,0.97,1127.459,1129.995,"So, at this time I move Council recommend it moved.",25,,
165,0.97,1129.995,1131.096,It is moved and Seconded.,25,,
166,0.97,1131.096,1149.581,"Now that the bill is before the committee I am going to propose to the committee hear a presentation from central staff on all of the proposed amendments, Councilmembers can ask questions related to the questions as we go down the list.",25,,
167,0.97,1149.581,1158.056,Freeman will address it in the order that I am proposing and how they are listed on the table chart.,25,,
168,0.97,1158.056,1184.416,I will just briefly say that the reason that I decided on this order and consultation with Council and central staff and with the committee clerk it is based on the deepest changes to the relatively more minor ones.,25,,
169,0.97,1184.416,1187.819,Obviously have big implications if Councilmember Pedersen's bill was immediately put in.,25,,
170,0.97,1187.819,1192.324,That is the basis for the ordering.,25,,
171,0.97,1192.324,1205.571,"So, based on that just quick overview, I will hand it over to Mr. Freeman for a general review of the amendments.",25,,
172,0.97,1205.571,1216.782,Each of you has a cover sheet that describes the 8 potential Amenitiments.,26,,
173,0.97,1216.782,1232.497,Behind it is the language distributed to them and then this morning with the additional Amenitiments.,26,,
174,0.97,1232.497,1237.436,First is Councilmember Pedersen substitute the number and the Council's intent towards the number.,26,,
175,0.97,1237.436,1252.117,The next category has to do with use and operating standards and the last category has to do with interim use encampment set backs and location.,26,,
176,0.97,1252.117,1254.119,With respect to Pederen's substitute.,26,,
177,0.97,1254.119,1259.091,What you have in your packet is a track version and as well as a clean copy.,26,,
178,0.97,1259.091,1270.902,It is probably worth explaining a couple--some of the changes version it is not--it is potentially confusing.,26,,
179,0.97,1270.902,1303.468,"Pedersen substitute would leave most procedural development for Encampments in place but makes some of the changes suggested in Sawant's bill and allow 10 Encampments and multiple 1 year extensions and Encampments temporary uses and the amendment would extend the South executing sunset from March 31st, 2020-To March 31st, 2022.",26,,
180,0.97,1303.468,1306.672,Reading the bill for the folks that are watching.,26,,
181,0.97,1306.672,1314.946,You will see strike Throughs for sections that include some portions that the Councilmember is proposing to amend.,26,,
182,0.97,1314.946,1321.853,"If you look at page 2 of Councilmember Pedersen's amendment, most of the standards are eliminated.",26,,
183,0.97,1321.853,1324.79,They are eliminated from the bill and not from the codes.,26,,
184,0.97,1324.79,1337.169,The effect of that would be that the Locational standards would remain with regulation for interim use for Encampments.,26,,
185,0.97,1337.169,1342.307,Moving on to any questions about Councilmember Pedersen's amendment.,26,,
186,0.97,1342.307,1381.246,"Moving on to amendments related to the number of authorized interim use Encampments, Mosqueda has amendments to reflect the Council's intent and make budget changes last year and signals the Council's intent of the future to review the camp and based on changed circumstances and those changed circumstances could include information coming from the homes count that is conducted annually.",26,,
187,0.97,1381.246,1385.417,And success of villages.,26,,
188,0.97,1385.417,1387.285,Number of authorized Encampments.,27,,
189,0.97,1387.285,1387.853,Councilmember Herbold.,28,,
190,0.97,1387.853,1396.228,"I lost my way, going back to amendment number one that Councilmember Pedersen is sponsoring.",29,,
191,0.97,1396.228,1410.642,"Part of it is moving the sunset date to 2022, and I believe correct me if I am wrong is that this is intended to allow the regional homeless authority to take over the work on updating the current process?",29,,
192,0.97,1410.642,1410.876,Yes.,30,,
193,0.97,1410.876,1439.204,"And, I guess I am a little concerned that since it is at least a year away, does this amendment allow for anything beyond sort of maintaining the status quo over the next year until the authority begins its work?",31,,
194,0.97,1439.204,1441.406,Chair can I answer the question?,32,,
195,0.97,1441.406,1465.297,"The cap goes--the 10 cap goes also with the sunset, it is not like we can move it forward with 10 now and wait for the regional housing authority to do its thing and then look at more than 10?",33,,
196,0.97,1465.297,1469.0,I think I understand the question.,34,,
197,0.97,1469.0,1491.656,"Major new expansion and change in our policy to make sure this authorization does not expire, extended 2 years to increase allowed Encampments from 3-10 and to allow the one-year extensions that were part of the original legislation.",34,,
198,0.97,1491.656,1494.759,So it does expand from 3-10.,34,,
199,0.97,1494.759,1510.141,It allows additional flexibility and 1 year extensions and the date is really just to get us so the regional homeless authority is operating and we can hear from those experts and implement those Evidence-Based strategies we are looking for.,34,,
200,0.97,1510.141,1511.943,Move from the 3-10 until after.,35,,
201,0.97,1511.943,1516.915,The 3-10 would happen immediately.,36,,
202,0.97,1516.915,1517.115,Yes.,36,,
203,0.97,1517.115,1517.415,Thank you.,36,,
204,0.97,1517.415,1517.949,Now I understand.,36,,
205,0.97,1517.949,1518.617,Immediate increase.,36,,
206,0.97,1518.617,1525.257,Did you have a question as well?,37,,
207,0.97,1525.257,1531.73,One process question I am assuming this is not the time to talk about our views on the amendment?,38,,
208,0.97,1531.73,1532.564,Is that correct?,38,,
209,0.97,1532.564,1536.101,We are just asking for Clarifications.,39,,
210,0.97,1536.101,1538.503,Not a full discussion.,40,,
211,0.97,1538.503,1539.271,Yes.,41,,
212,0.97,1539.271,1539.538,Okay.,42,,
213,0.97,1539.538,1539.771,Yes.,43,,
214,0.97,1539.771,1540.605,That is where we are.,43,,
215,0.97,1540.605,1541.806,It was your question.,44,,
216,0.97,1541.806,1544.409,It was a question not a leading question.,45,,
217,0.97,1544.409,1545.477,[Laughter],45,,
218,0.97,1545.477,1545.71,Yes.,46,,
219,0.97,1545.71,1546.044,Yes.,47,,
220,0.97,1546.044,1546.912,That is why I am asking.,47,,
221,0.97,1546.912,1553.785,"Yes, it is not yet time to ask our Rhetorical questions.",48,,
222,0.97,1553.785,1555.954,Thank you for clarifying the process.,49,,
223,0.97,1555.954,1565.83,On actual questions I am a little confused by what Council Pedersen said.,49,,
224,0.97,1565.83,1574.472,"It is a funding body I am not exactly sure what--I don't know--I don't have any idea what you mean, honestly?",49,,
225,0.97,1574.472,1586.985,So the regional homeless authority will be providing recommendations on how to.,50,,
226,0.97,1586.985,1587.719,People lived experience.,50,,
227,0.97,1587.719,1593.258,The members of the King County Council and Seattle city council are on that.,50,,
228,0.97,1593.258,1596.728,Those boards and so I think the regional authority is looking for direction.,50,,
229,0.97,1596.728,1615.614,The whole reason we created that was to have that expertise and sound direction from them on where to fund investments rather than doing anything drastic or doing anything current.,50,,
230,0.97,1615.614,1622.02,"This would allow from 3-10, allow the 1-Year extensions and then we will see how things go with the regional homeless authority.",50,,
231,0.97,1622.02,1623.355,Do you have another clarifying question?,51,,
232,0.97,1623.355,1630.895,It is not a question.,52,,
233,0.97,1630.895,1635.7,"I do want to clarify, though.",52,,
234,0.97,1635.7,1639.571,It does not comment on funding at all.,52,,
235,0.97,1639.571,1647.645,Advancing the ceiling of the tiny House project that can possibly be sit waited in of the city limits.,52,,
236,0.97,1647.645,1649.414,"But, the funding question still remains separate.",52,,
237,0.97,1649.414,1658.99,And I have been saying over and over again.,52,,
238,0.97,1658.99,1662.093,It is an important step.,52,,
239,0.97,1662.093,1671.136,I believe the homeless authority will provide guidance and land use that we required vice Teut for 2 years.,52,,
240,0.97,1671.136,1680.478,They would not be able to fund anything if the city law does not allow it.,53,,
241,0.97,1680.478,1687.452,"At this point, spilling over to debating the merits of the substitute bill.",54,,
242,0.97,1687.452,1700.632,And good conversation but let's hold it at this point until we get to formally considering it.,54,,
243,0.97,1700.632,1709.741,Unless there are final questions clarifying the substitute bill.,54,,
244,0.97,1709.741,1714.579,This is the second amendment that deals with it.,55,,
245,0.97,1714.579,1720.151,Proposed by Councilmember Lewis that would increase the number from 3-20.,55,,
246,0.97,1720.151,1722.687,Introduce the bill and the number from 3-40.,55,,
247,0.97,1722.687,1730.161,And the next amendments have to do with use and encampment operating standards.,55,,
248,0.97,1730.161,1734.866,The first is an amendment provided by Pedersen.,55,,
249,0.97,1734.866,1753.518,Tiny House villages and the interim use regime sleeping areas and Encampments must be required to have a structure to reflect the concept of tiny houses and require 24-hour security and case management.,55,,
250,0.97,1753.518,1760.525,The next amendment is proposed by Councilmember Lewis.,55,,
251,0.97,1760.525,1766.197,It is similar to Pedersen but deals with security and concept of tiny house not included.,55,,
252,0.97,1766.197,1770.034,If I can just take a moment on that one.,56,,
253,0.97,1770.034,1787.652,I will be withdrawing that amendment today based on some conversations with Councilmember Mosqueda's office and raised concerned with that amendment.,56,,
254,0.97,1787.652,1800.064,My understand was that amendment purely dealt with sort of Memorializing established requirements and our current practices of administering tiny House Encampments.,56,,
255,0.97,1800.064,1808.606,I think my read from E-Mailing back and forth with you earlier it is more complicated than that.,56,,
256,0.97,1808.606,1820.485,My intention would be to take a week and work on some substitute language with that amendment when we bring it forward for the final vote.,56,,
257,0.97,1820.485,1825.356,It is something that accomplishes the same purpose.,56,,
258,0.97,1825.356,1839.404,But a little more reflective of what our current practices are with how case management and security is provided in tiny House Encampments.,56,,
259,0.97,1839.404,1849.08,Not my intention to create new requirements for tiny house or transitional it was rather to put in writing practices that are already in place.,56,,
260,0.97,1849.08,1862.794,Just to make sure that that is what we are doing with the amendment language I am going to withdrawal that from consideration today and work on that over the course of the next week.,56,,
261,0.97,1862.794,1863.061,Okay.,57,,
262,0.97,1863.061,1864.762,Moving on to the next amendment.,57,,
263,0.97,1864.762,1893.091,"Just on that, I know you are--I know you are Withdrawaling it.",58,,
264,0.97,1893.091,1903.334,"And the use of Encampments, compliance with contract performance that receive city funds be an operating requirement for that transitional village.",59,,
265,0.97,1903.334,1909.574,Moving on to the next 2.,60,,
266,0.97,1909.574,1910.675,"Proposed by Councilmember Herbold, encamp.",60,,
267,0.97,1910.675,1914.979,Locations within the city and the on a site.,60,,
268,0.97,1914.979,1917.048,Dealing with setbacks.,60,,
269,0.97,1917.048,1938.67,"The first amendment as it is geographic distribution require that currently remind Councilmembers of the current standard, currently interim use of Encampments have to be located 1 mile from any other type of encampment with certain exceptions.",60,,
270,0.97,1938.67,1946.744,This amendment would maintain that standard until geographic distribution is met throughout the city.,60,,
271,0.97,1946.744,1954.152,And there are exceptions to that.,60,,
272,0.97,1954.152,1956.821,The next amendment for Councilmember Herbold.,60,,
273,0.97,1956.821,1970.034,Standards from 10 foot stand back from single families on properties and 5 feet from all others required when there is not an established use.,60,,
274,0.97,1970.034,1971.135,Those are the 8 amendments.,60,,
275,0.97,1971.135,1986.551,I do have a question about that last amendment that Herbold put forward how does it interface with it.,61,,
276,0.97,1986.551,1993.191,"This is a picture, this discussion would benefit from a picture outside of it, describe it to you.",62,,
277,0.97,1993.191,2002.033,Centered around the plans for each of the Encampments.,62,,
278,0.97,2002.033,2004.369,There is really only one.,62,,
279,0.97,2004.369,2019.951,"Set back from all residential properties, Whittier heights has site limitation based on that set back and there is an adjacent multifamily zone across the alley from Whittier heights tiny House village.",62,,
280,0.97,2019.951,2023.988,The alley towards that set back.,62,,
281,0.97,2023.988,2030.695,Limits the alley width.,62,,
282,0.97,2030.695,2031.863,There are 9 feet.,62,,
283,0.97,2031.863,2033.998,Not used for active and bicycle parking there.,62,,
284,0.97,2033.998,2040.138,Another place to look to understand what this amendment might look like is true hope village.,62,,
285,0.97,2040.138,2047.612,True hope village is not established as an interim in use encampment.,62,,
286,0.97,2047.612,2055.72,"It is institution of the Baptist church and they provided volunteered setbacks, that is split zoned.",62,,
287,0.97,2055.72,2070.034,"Part of it in a commercial zone and multifamily zone and low rise multifamily zones, 10 foot setbacks on property lines on the commercial zone, no set back.",62,,
288,0.97,2070.034,2070.401,All right.,63,,
289,0.97,2070.401,2076.841,Thank you for that clarification.,64,,
290,0.97,2076.841,2092.056,Are there any final kind of questions related to how the amendments work and what they will do for central staff or the sponsor of the amendments potentially before we move on to actually considering them?,64,,
291,0.97,2092.056,2092.857,Yes Councilmember Herbold.,64,,
292,0.97,2092.857,2095.159,As it relates to the disbursement amendment.,65,,
293,0.97,2095.159,2116.114,We heard from folks in public comment about concerns as it relates to how the ordinance addresses safe parking lot and that safe parking lot sort of part of the definition of a transitional encampment.,65,,
294,0.97,2116.114,2154.585,I want to ask that you share with me what I--what you share with my colleagues what you share with me after I heard the public comment as it relates specifically to the both transition Allen Campments as traditionally think of them as tiny House villages and safe parking lots that are under the religious exceptions part of the permitting process.,65,,
295,0.97,2154.585,2165.196,The encampment use of having tents and similar shelter including vehicles used for shelter that provides temporary quarters.,66,,
296,0.97,2165.196,2170.067,"Common food preparation, shower and other facilities for sleeping shelters.",66,,
297,0.97,2170.067,2186.117,"My understanding is that most safe parking lots are not established as interim use Encampments, they are accessory to Faith-Based organization.",66,,
298,0.97,2186.117,2186.951,Out of a church.,66,,
299,0.97,2186.951,2200.364,Traditional encampment can include a safe parking lot with or without a association with a Faith-Based institution.,66,,
300,0.97,2200.364,2207.572,"But, the bill as written now would allow safe parking lots to be permitted through the interim Pathway.",66,,
301,0.97,2207.572,2209.807,They can be permitted through a temporary use process.,66,,
302,0.97,2209.807,2220.284,And one thing to keep in mind is there is an exception to the disbursement requirement and that is for smaller sites.,66,,
303,0.97,2220.284,2234.665,"So, let me see if I can find the exact language.",66,,
304,0.97,2234.665,2249.78,I think it is if there are 10 or fewer residential or villages it does not apply.,67,,
305,0.97,2249.78,2255.486,"Smaller scale, I am not finding it here Councilmember Herbold.",67,,
306,0.97,2255.486,2261.859,For smaller scale Encampments established through the interim use 1 mile requirement does not apply.,67,,
307,0.97,2261.859,2266.731,"You thought of everything, thank you.",68,,
308,0.97,2266.731,2271.435,And I have one clarifying question.,69,,
309,0.97,2271.435,2285.349,"Councilmember Herbold's amendment 7. is my reading correct on the second Bracketed part of that, that the 1 mile separation would no longer apply if there was a camp, an encampment in every single district.",69,,
310,0.97,2285.349,2285.983,That is correct.,70,,
311,0.97,2285.983,2289.654,That is what I thought.,70,,
312,0.97,2289.654,2291.188,Just wanted to make sure.,70,,
313,0.97,2291.188,2296.994,Does anyone have anymore final questions for central staff?,71,,
314,0.97,2296.994,2297.194,Okay.,71,,
315,0.97,2297.194,2297.595,"So, seeing none.",71,,
316,0.97,2297.595,2306.604,"I think we can proceed along here to the amendments, Councilmember Pedersen would you like to move your substitute bill.",71,,
317,0.97,2306.604,2311.275,"Yes, I would like to move my substitute bill for discussion.",72,,
318,0.97,2311.275,2313.077,I second.,73,,
319,0.97,2313.077,2314.211,Thank you.,74,,
320,0.97,2314.211,2317.481,Thank you for presenting that to us.,74,,
321,0.97,2317.481,2334.799,The purpose of this substitute bill is to recognize that the current law is expiring and we want to keep the number of Encampments that we currently have and not let the law expire.,74,,
322,0.97,2334.799,2355.82,"Also want to increase some flexibility and increase the numbers a little bit as we wait for the regional homeless authority to provide information to us specifically according to the Interlocal agreement for Council, the previous Council passed.",74,,
323,0.97,2355.82,2360.725,The authority is to develop and implement a 5-Year plan.,74,,
324,0.97,2360.725,2367.431,The 5-Year plan incorporates requirements of the master agreements from the parties and requirements from the Funders.,74,,
325,0.97,2367.431,2372.57,May be informed by regional action plan.,74,,
326,0.97,2372.57,2385.549,The 5 year plan incorporates principals of equity and social injustice and strategies to reduce homeless in youth and young adults and those that experience health challenges.,74,,
327,0.97,2385.549,2402.099,The purpose of this substitute is really to get us to that period when we will have the five year plan from the authority that will recommend various interventions based on the experts including people with experience.,74,,
328,0.97,2402.099,2410.107,In addition the substitute would increase from 3-10.,74,,
329,0.97,2410.107,2412.476,The number of interim use Encampments.,74,,
330,0.97,2412.476,2419.483,"Currently, code allows up to 3.",74,,
331,0.97,2419.483,2427.358,"However, it allows unlimited for accessory Encampments and temporary Encampments, limited for those.",74,,
332,0.97,2427.358,2431.962,My substitute would increase the interim use from 3-10.,74,,
333,0.97,2431.962,2448.712,And also allow for 1 year extensions of interim use encampment permits to be handled by the director of Seattle construction and inspections.,74,,
334,0.97,2448.712,2453.484,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen are there anymore comments?",75,,
335,0.97,2453.484,2454.585,Councilmember Herbold.,76,,
336,0.97,2454.585,2455.786,I have a question.,76,,
337,0.97,2455.786,2459.089,I will direct it to central staff if it is okay.,76,,
338,0.97,2459.089,2468.732,I want to understand how the limit of 10 would play out likely to be played out in the real world.,76,,
339,0.97,2468.732,2483.18,"We now have a situation where we have about 7 Encampments, maybe 8 that are permitted under the temporary process.",76,,
340,0.97,2483.18,2489.053,It is 8. not all of them are permitted under the temporary use process.,77,,
341,0.97,2489.053,2508.806,Looking at the permit records for the 8 Encampments I believe 6 of them are permitted to temporary use permits.,77,,
342,0.97,2508.806,2523.287,"So, after passage of this legislation is it reasonable to assume given the track record of the 6 of 8 that are currently permitted under the temporary use permit process.",77,,
343,0.97,2523.287,2534.398,They are going to move to be under this ordinance with longevity.,77,,
344,0.97,2534.398,2538.402,That is a likely scenario.,78,,
345,0.97,2538.402,2546.076,The best Pathway for the encampment is with and Assocition with a Faith-Based host.,78,,
346,0.97,2546.076,2549.947,No limit how the encampment can be at that location.,78,,
347,0.97,2549.947,2556.086,"If there are a lack of hosts, for example, the Pathway is Preferrable.",78,,
348,0.97,2556.086,2559.256,More serenity for the provider than the temporary use Pathway.,78,,
349,0.97,2559.256,2579.476,Given we don't know everything and it is possible for some additional hosts to come by and agree to enter into a lease agreement with the property owner so that they can be exempt from their temporary use permit process or this ordinance.,79,,
350,0.97,2579.476,2590.654,I think it is reasonable to assume at least 6 will move to be implemented and allowed under this ordinance.,79,,
351,0.97,2590.654,2620.484,"So, my concern is it will only allow for 4 additional and given the Councilmember Pedersen's amendment, substitute version would only allow for probably four additional Encampments until sunset associated with the regional homeless authority.",79,,
352,0.97,2620.484,2624.388,"So, that is my concern with this.",79,,
353,0.97,2624.388,2639.737,"Just to go over the progressive measures of the original bill under consideration that would be removed by this, what is called an amendment.",80,,
354,0.97,2639.737,2650.18,"The original, bill, if passed, would make tiny houses available in different zones, one of the major components.",80,,
355,0.97,2650.18,2655.919,Increasing the number of permitted tiny house that is why we are considering it in the first place.,80,,
356,0.97,2655.919,2666.997,"Major homelessness crisis and we don't want more barriers, the purpose is to remove those barriers and to provide a expansion of a solution that is working.",80,,
357,0.97,2666.997,2675.539,Everybody on this Council says Data-Driven 10 times a day.,80,,
358,0.97,2675.539,2676.707,This is incredibly data driven.,80,,
359,0.97,2676.707,2681.345,"And, this amendment would create a clause expires in 2022.",80,,
360,0.97,2681.345,2685.849,That would mean going to another 7 months to extend the permits.,80,,
361,0.97,2685.849,2695.225,Understand the process of the next bill to extend it in the next couple of months.,80,,
362,0.97,2695.225,2702.099,"I mean, I obviously oppose this amendment, undo 7 months of work and extending tiny House villages.",80,,
363,0.97,2702.099,2711.375,"It is really as I said, it is a no vote on the legislation as a whole.",80,,
364,0.97,2711.375,2713.343,It dismantles everything.,80,,
365,0.97,2713.343,2720.884,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",81,,
366,0.97,2720.884,2721.452,Any additional comments?,81,,
367,0.97,2721.452,2721.752,Okay.,81,,
368,0.97,2721.752,2722.086,Seeing none.,81,,
369,0.97,2722.086,2722.653,Councilmember Pedersen.,81,,
370,0.97,2722.653,2725.989,You have a right to make final remarks.,81,,
371,0.97,2725.989,2734.465,"So, I am going to say briefly first I do thank Pedersen for bringing it forward.",81,,
372,0.97,2734.465,2745.442,And introduced in the new regional authority in the context of accommodating the number of interim use permits that we have funding for.,81,,
373,0.97,2745.442,2747.778,I am going to vote against this amendment today.,81,,
374,0.97,2747.778,2755.185,The reason for it is based on a lot of my conversations with advocates and central staff.,81,,
375,0.97,2755.185,2769.133,"I do think it would be good to incorporate flexibility, to allow more use for permits for the same reasons Councilmember Herbold highlighted in her comments.",81,,
376,0.97,2769.133,2771.401,Funding to go up to 10 now.,81,,
377,0.97,2771.401,2778.775,I don't want to do more of or pursuit more additional funding for this.,81,,
378,0.97,2778.775,2804.868,"I also am not excited, I feel like I am speaking for our land use attorneys and the city attorney's office now in putting this out there, too, for the prospect of relying on temporary use permits more potentially while we are considering the regime.",81,,
379,0.97,2804.868,2807.037,Even though they are good at it.,81,,
380,0.97,2807.037,2811.475,And I am proud of our land use division in the city attorney's office.,81,,
381,0.97,2811.475,2831.094,I do think as long as we have a position where we cannot authorize more and additional housing permits later.,81,,
382,0.97,2831.094,2831.795,That is preferred action.,81,,
383,0.97,2831.795,2838.202,Councilmember Pedersen I do want you to have the last word as the sponsor of it.,81,,
384,0.97,2838.202,2842.472,Thank you for the healthy debate.,82,,
385,0.97,2842.472,2855.519,Good that we asking these questions and I am glad to have it before us to set a baseline to give people the choice if they wanted to extend the existing law with some additional flexibility.,82,,
386,0.97,2855.519,2862.459,I strongly believe in the regional authority that we needed to help with our crisis.,82,,
387,0.97,2862.459,2869.199,And look forward to their 5 year plan.,82,,
388,0.97,2869.199,2876.473,And cautious about expanding certain policies until we hear from the regional homeless authority.,82,,
389,0.97,2876.473,2877.274,I appreciate everyone's comments.,82,,
390,0.97,2877.274,2879.91,Thank you.,83,,
391,0.97,2879.91,2886.45,All of those in favor of Pedersen's substitute bill.,84,,
392,0.97,2886.45,2889.753,All of those opposed.,85,,
393,0.97,2889.753,2895.125,"By a vote of 1-4, this amendment fails.",85,,
394,0.97,2895.125,2898.729,"Proceeding now to the next amendment, Councilmember Mosqueda cannot join us yet.",85,,
395,0.97,2898.729,2906.103,Her staff did ask that I move this in her absence.,85,,
396,0.97,2906.103,2909.506,So I will move Councilmember Mosqueda's amendment number one.,85,,
397,0.97,2909.506,2910.44,There has been a second.,85,,
398,0.97,2910.44,2912.709,She is not here to speak to the amendment.,85,,
399,0.97,2912.709,2915.612,I will also speak to it.,85,,
400,0.97,2915.612,2922.619,This is a fairly straightforward amendment to the where as sections of the ordinance.,85,,
401,0.97,2922.619,2942.406,It establishes that regardless of what we ultimately land on in terms of the interim use permits we are basically just saying that we think the tiny House villages and transitional Encampments have a lot of value in our conversation of navigating folks out of Homesness.,85,,
402,0.97,2942.406,2944.474,That we are going to constantly--homelessness.,85,,
403,0.97,2944.474,2962.526,"That we are going to be constantly looking at Encampments, tiny House villages and it will inform future decisions on permits that we determine as a matter of policy we want to pursuit.",86,,
404,0.97,2962.526,2966.663,Is there anymore discussion on this amendment?,86,,
405,0.97,2966.663,2968.398,Okay.,86,,
406,0.97,2968.398,2968.732,Seeing none.,86,,
407,0.97,2968.732,2983.914,All of those in favor of Councilmember Mosqueda's amendment 1.,86,,
408,0.97,2983.914,2991.822,Signify by a vote of 6-0 that amendment does pass.,86,,
409,0.97,2991.822,3003.967,Now moving on to the third amendment and that is my amendment that would increase the number of authorized interim use.,87,,
410,0.97,3003.967,3012.609,So I will move that amendment is there a second.,87,,
411,0.97,3012.609,3025.756,And I--I will admit at the out set of this I do not have strong feelings about this amendment because the number of encampment permits at a certain level is symbolic.,88,,
412,0.97,3025.756,3035.365,"The Council only has funding currently, I believe, for 10 interim use Encampments.",88,,
413,0.97,3035.365,3042.973,The way they are funded is particularly through grants at Hsd that go to provider.,88,,
414,0.97,3042.973,3051.348,I do think it is important that we alluded to in our earlier remarks to have a number.,88,,
415,0.97,3051.348,3056.987,"The number that we do have the funding for, in this case, 10.",88,,
416,0.97,3056.987,3067.798,We can consider in future budgets to increase funding for the villages.,88,,
417,0.97,3067.798,3078.642,To consider using it as a bigger tool navigating folks out of homelessness.,88,,
418,0.97,3078.642,3093.29,I am concerned that if we say 40 permits folks will expect 40 transitional Encampments and be disappointed when it is only there for 10.,88,,
419,0.97,3093.29,3096.46,Budgets and what we do decide to focus on.,88,,
420,0.97,3096.46,3099.229,"I think there is another argument, though.",88,,
421,0.97,3099.229,3108.405,I don't think 40 Encampments is a good use of our resources ultimately in combating homelessness.,88,,
422,0.97,3108.405,3122.085,"That what we really need to do is dramatically increase our placements into permit supportive housing, and scale it up.",88,,
423,0.97,3122.085,3125.088,There needs to be more permanent housing.,88,,
424,0.97,3125.088,3132.195,We should not get used to this being the method we are using and getting folks into shelter.,88,,
425,0.97,3132.195,3137.267,"So, for that reason I think that 20 seems to be a good number.",88,,
426,0.97,3137.267,3150.213,I did reach that number in consultation with a number of people.,88,,
427,0.97,3150.213,3154.184,To get anticipated future Encampments.,88,,
428,0.97,3154.184,3181.845,"I do want to say that one Counterargument since Councilmember Mosqueda raised that in the event of a natural disaster or something we would have to site a Disperportionate number of people in Encampments it would be good to have flexibility of an emergency, one time influx of camps.",88,,
429,0.97,3181.845,3191.087,"But, barring extreme circumstances I don't think it is likely we will get anywhere near the 40 number.",88,,
430,0.97,3191.087,3198.695,"To avoid controversy and undo heartbreak over having such a high number without the resources to back it up, 20 is more appropriate.",88,,
431,0.97,3198.695,3203.099,Now if there are any comments on this Councilmember Strauss.,88,,
432,0.97,3203.099,3205.802,"Chair, I appreciate you bringing the bill into your Committee.",89,,
433,0.97,3205.802,3236.233,"It is a land use decision and it touches on the homelessness, the city has funding for 10 of these Encampments or tiny home villages and this bill is a document that Aligns us with our analysis on these tiny home villages.",89,,
434,0.97,3236.233,3238.501,So it is a ceiling not a creation.,89,,
435,0.97,3238.501,3244.608,That is I didn't think 40 is the appropriate number for the big.,89,,
436,0.97,3244.608,3254.084,"Technical, not appropriation of funds, not appropriation of case management, not appropriation of security, it is a technical bill aligned with the analysis.",89,,
437,0.97,3254.084,3258.288,I do want to speak on some other points at other times.,89,,
438,0.97,3258.288,3264.427,I will do a back of the envelope Cal cow Hraeugz of everyone who is sleeping outside right now.,89,,
439,0.97,3264.427,3270.533,If all 40 were built to the maximum capacity we would be able to bring everyone inside.,89,,
440,0.97,3270.533,3284.247,I think we need to take a moment to understand that because as I look at my community in Ballard the green space I look at outside of my bedroom window has people in public space.,89,,
441,0.97,3284.247,3286.583,They have been moved and held back.,89,,
442,0.97,3286.583,3286.85,Right?,89,,
443,0.97,3286.85,3289.719,So I can see a tent from my bedroom window.,89,,
444,0.97,3289.719,3297.46,This is a block from where the tiny home village was in Ballard.,89,,
445,0.97,3297.46,3301.965,There is an outset.,89,,
446,0.97,3301.965,3313.243,"When they were ready to believe more eyes on the street, more activation and we have less negative behavior because there are more people here.",89,,
447,0.97,3313.243,3326.122,Whittier heights is another tiny home village in my community that is Excelling very well and is loved by the community.,89,,
448,0.97,3326.122,3339.335,Thinking this entire bill is a procedural technical fix to align us with the amendments and there is still a permitting process.,89,,
449,0.97,3339.335,3342.806,"Excuse me, a permitting process for every tiny house built up.",89,,
450,0.97,3342.806,3356.419,"Not creating new tiny home villages, not setting more money for tiny home villages, not permitting them, it is simply setting a Creeling in line with the process that has occurred.",89,,
451,0.97,3356.419,3359.956,Thank you.,90,,
452,0.97,3359.956,3362.192,Any other comments on this amendment Councilmember Herbold.,90,,
453,0.97,3362.192,3370.8,I want to remind the committee it is not a bill to allow them.,91,,
454,0.97,3370.8,3375.505,It is a bill to permit sanctioned temporary Encampments.,91,,
455,0.97,3375.505,3378.208,Sometimes those are tiny home villages.,91,,
456,0.97,3378.208,3379.042,Often they are not.,91,,
457,0.97,3379.042,3391.354,Every single one of our tiny home villages we have now started as a temporary outdoor tent encampment.,91,,
458,0.97,3391.354,3404.434,Where as on one hand I can see someone characterizing this legislation as a procedure just to remind procedure we are talking about.,91,,
459,0.97,3404.434,3417.18,"We are talking about the analysis of impacts on Encampments that, in some cases, will be tiny home villages and other cases it will not.",91,,
460,0.97,3417.18,3437.434,And I want to remind folks that we--when we are thinking about this bill I think we tonight think of tiny home villages that are recipients of funding for the city for case management.,91,,
461,0.97,3437.434,3439.536,That is not a requirement.,91,,
462,0.97,3439.536,3451.281,To function there is not a requirement for case management or operating costs associated with the tiny home.,91,,
463,0.97,3451.281,3458.421,There is an allowance for an operator to establish an encampment of which can be many forms.,91,,
464,0.97,3458.421,3460.39,For that reason.,91,,
465,0.97,3460.39,3471.868,"I do think that we are growing, gradually is appropriate.",91,,
466,0.97,3471.868,3473.503,Thank you.,92,,
467,0.97,3473.503,3473.97,Councilmember Sawant?,92,,
468,0.97,3473.97,3474.204,Yes.,93,,
469,0.97,3474.204,3481.01,I just wanted to say--first of all I agree with you Councilmember Lewis.,93,,
470,0.97,3481.01,3486.483,That the goal is--we say it all of the time.,93,,
471,0.97,3486.483,3494.858,"The goal is permanent housing, permanent housing, depending on what the needs are.",93,,
472,0.97,3494.858,3504.767,But we are talking about allowing more tiny houses to number our city because of lack of funding for our housing.,93,,
473,0.97,3504.767,3546.676,And threat from Preepgz--continuing.,93,,
474,0.97,3546.676,3570.466,"So, I feel like having a limit of 40 as the ceiling it is much better than 20 because of all of the--I don't want to repeat the points that were made but I feel like just because you--you have tiny House villages or you permit them does not mean it will make people homeless, not if you made more religion there would be more homeless people.",93,,
475,0.97,3570.466,3583.646,The question is if people are homeless would we rather them have access to a tiny home village and an opportunity to maintain their dignity and humanity or would you rather them sleeping on the streets.,93,,
476,0.97,3583.646,3586.849,I think for me the answer is clear.,93,,
477,0.97,3586.849,3588.952,I would be voting no on this amendment.,93,,
478,0.97,3588.952,3590.219,Thank you.,94,,
479,0.97,3590.219,3592.956,Are there any final comments on the amendment?,94,,
480,0.97,3592.956,3600.997,"Seeing none, I will make a few final comments as the chair.",94,,
481,0.97,3600.997,3609.772,I totally appreciate and understand the comments by Strauss and Sawant.,94,,
482,0.97,3609.772,3614.711,I intend to work with both of you for more funding.,94,,
483,0.97,3614.711,3623.586,As someone who has some near where I live and two in my district I am a big supporter of them.,94,,
484,0.97,3623.586,3635.198,I have seen firsthand the outcomes that we can get.,94,,
485,0.97,3635.198,3645.274,Realistically I don't think that over the course of this authorizing language we will be anywhere close.,94,,
486,0.97,3645.274,3648.044,"Just going through it, it is a number to set.",94,,
487,0.97,3648.044,3663.092,"I will, at this point, call for a vote on this amendment and we can proceed to the rest of the agenda.",94,,
488,0.97,3663.092,3663.359,Signify.,94,,
489,0.97,3663.359,3669.365,By a vote of 3-3 I don't know what happens.,94,,
490,0.97,3669.365,3670.633,Fails.,95,,
491,0.97,3670.633,3670.933,Okay.,96,,
492,0.97,3670.933,3671.234,Excellent.,96,,
493,0.97,3671.234,3671.534,Thank you.,96,,
494,0.97,3671.534,3676.239,Proceeding then to the next amendment.,96,,
495,0.97,3676.239,3683.079,This is Councilmember Pedersen's amendment 1. would you like to speak to your amendment.,96,,
496,0.97,3683.079,3683.446,Thank you.,97,,
497,0.97,3683.446,3683.746,Actually --,97,,
498,0.97,3683.746,3687.35,"First off, would you like to move your amendment?",98,,
499,0.97,3687.35,3693.423,I would like to move my amendment that is list as number 4.,99,,
500,0.97,3693.423,3694.791,Is there a second.,100,,
501,0.97,3694.791,3695.358,Second.,101,,
502,0.97,3695.358,3695.625,Okay.,102,,
503,0.97,3695.625,3697.226,You may now speak to your amendment.,102,,
504,0.97,3697.226,3697.76,Thank you.,103,,
505,0.97,3697.76,3706.135,"We have been talking a lot about tiny home villages, the Legislations advertised.",103,,
506,0.97,3706.135,3722.518,I think it is important to note that the actual Seattle municipal code is a transition Allen encampment.,103,,
507,0.97,3722.518,3724.454,Providing temporary quarters and sleeping.,103,,
508,0.97,3724.454,3732.228,"The use may have common food preparation, shower or other commonly used facilities that are separate from the sleeping shelters.",103,,
509,0.97,3732.228,3737.867,It does not actually have what we have grown to know as tiny home villages.,103,,
510,0.97,3737.867,3750.98,Something that started off with not great results in terms of Exiting people experiencing homelessness to permanent housing.,103,,
511,0.97,3750.98,3753.783,When there was a structure provided.,103,,
512,0.97,3753.783,3759.489,"When there was case management, security, the tiny home village model Bcame successful.",103,,
513,0.97,3759.489,3771.367,"So, with this amendment, what it will do is grandfather the Encouragements as they are.",103,,
514,0.97,3771.367,3773.136,And we have tiny home villages.,103,,
515,0.97,3773.136,3777.373,What we have is the structure of the tiny home.,103,,
516,0.97,3777.373,3785.815,"It has 4 walls, and then, it has what we know to be the key to success.",103,,
517,0.97,3785.815,3798.594,Is the ongoing case management for the residents so they can get into permanent housing.,103,,
518,0.97,3798.594,3800.229,That led to the success rate.,103,,
519,0.97,3800.229,3811.807,To actually do Whaty with are saying to do and create tiny village that have the case management.,103,,
520,0.97,3811.807,3813.409,"Thank you, Councilmember, are there anymore comments?",103,,
521,0.97,3813.409,3823.119,Given the fact that this is a question from the Proposer of the amendment.,103,,
522,0.97,3823.119,3845.508,Nearly every if not every tiny House village started as an encampment I sort of see the land use code legislation that allows for Encampments as creating a Pathway to be born if you will as attempt encampment and grow into a tiny House village.,103,,
523,0.97,3845.508,3855.718,We also see some interest in some of the properties that have hosted Encampments and now tiny House villages in the near future.,103,,
524,0.97,3855.718,3867.496,"So, it is sort of--like I said it is an evolution in Pathway.",103,,
525,0.97,3867.496,3873.336,I share your Angst that we keep talking about it as a tiny House village.,103,,
526,0.97,3873.336,3875.438,It is not.,103,,
527,0.97,3875.438,3880.243,We need to be accurate.,103,,
528,0.97,3880.243,3882.345,So we are under that.,103,,
529,0.97,3882.345,3899.395,I would like to hear your thoughts about how that Pathway would be impacted as a tent encampment.,103,,
530,0.97,3899.395,3918.714,"We have a tiny House village in my district, the North Lake village and it is, to its success is to have the structure and to have the case management.",104,,
531,0.97,3918.714,3921.284,There was not not a case there.,104,,
532,0.97,3921.284,3935.564,If we are looking to expand something we need to start right.,104,,
533,0.97,3935.564,3954.784,"So, if we are going to expand it to a large number we should have them start in a way to get people moving from the encampment into permanent housing at a higher percentage rate.",104,,
534,0.97,3954.784,3958.621,We are helping people.,104,,
535,0.97,3958.621,3960.489,And my follow up.,105,,
536,0.97,3960.489,3983.612,"Along with the possibility for these locations to serve as transition Encampments and having people live in cars or Rvs, given the population in last year's point time count is made up of those folks I would hate to Foreclose those folks as well.",105,,
537,0.97,3983.612,3988.017,It is--it is not meant to.,106,,
538,0.97,3988.017,3996.359,"Because it is talking about having the structure of the 4 walls, a roof, and a door the vehicles would have that structure.",106,,
539,0.97,3996.359,4018.114,"If you felt like that was important to clarify that with, to say or Nonrv vehicles, I would accept that amendment to this to make it clear that car safe laws would be allowed under this.",106,,
540,0.97,4018.114,4024.553,Councilmember Sawant had her hand up.,107,,
541,0.97,4024.553,4028.391,And then Morales.,108,,
542,0.97,4028.391,4029.892,I appreciate that point.,109,,
543,0.97,4029.892,4031.027,Herbold brought up.,109,,
544,0.97,4031.027,4038.601,I think it is concrete to understand how they are established.,109,,
545,0.97,4038.601,4050.146,Every tiny house and Councilmember pointed this out is before every tiny in Seattle started with it and replace tiny houses as it developed.,109,,
546,0.97,4050.146,4056.385,"You know, those are being long time advocates know what I am talking about.",109,,
547,0.97,4056.385,4058.921,Second chance in West Seattle.,109,,
548,0.97,4058.921,4062.191,Started as Unpermitted encampment of tents.,109,,
549,0.97,4062.191,4073.502,"Community support, they won legal permitting and began replacing the tents with tiny houses, my office, supported them and we successfully prevented them from being swept.",109,,
550,0.97,4073.502,4087.383,And then after that my office and other Councilmembers supported the formal permitting and the funding that helped get them to bring in tiny houses in place of tents.,109,,
551,0.97,4087.383,4092.354,This is the evolution of tiny House villages.,109,,
552,0.97,4092.354,4103.232,It is not how it has evolved these are people experiencing extreme hardship and they are held by shoestring Nonprofits.,109,,
553,0.97,4103.232,4106.335,Doing a lot of work on the ground.,109,,
554,0.97,4106.335,4106.869,Making it into reality.,109,,
555,0.97,4106.869,4120.282,"It did not 19 one day and it needed our support, first, to allow them to be permitted in Encampments and tiny House religions.",109,,
556,0.97,4120.282,4121.417,And the tiny House religions.,109,,
557,0.97,4121.417,4121.717,Or houses.,109,,
558,0.97,4121.717,4122.451,Before getting the permit.,109,,
559,0.97,4122.451,4127.49,I don't know how they would of gotten to this point.,109,,
560,0.97,4127.49,4134.13,Legal STAT us and--status and they would not have gotten tiny House villages.,109,,
561,0.97,4134.13,4146.242,"I really urge that if Councilmembers support tiny houses which I, of course, agree with you on, without them, if that is Tru I true I would provide funding.",109,,
562,0.97,4146.242,4158.654,"Not built in, it is a land use bill, rather than Crating obstacles for something that is Unimaginably difficult.",109,,
563,0.97,4158.654,4161.09,"All right, Councilmember Strauss.",110,,
564,0.97,4161.09,4162.224,"Thank you, chair.",111,,
565,0.97,4162.224,4162.858,"Thank you, Pedersen.",111,,
566,0.97,4162.858,4172.368,I spoke to both of you about the 24-hour security issue in your amendments today.,111,,
567,0.97,4172.368,4178.44,I absolutely support having case managers on every single tiny home village site.,111,,
568,0.97,4178.44,4186.849,"And, I also understand that 24- hour security looks different for the level of barriers that the site is housing.",111,,
569,0.97,4186.849,4191.487,"So, completely Sobber housing has a different need for security than no barrier housing, right?",111,,
570,0.97,4191.487,4204.133,I want to make sure we are using our taxpayer there Ares effectively and efficiently.,112,,
571,0.97,4204.133,4219.014,As well as Pedersen you may of heard the requirement of getting the roof and the door that someone can walk throughout the last number of months as my gold standard for how we bring people inside.,112,,
572,0.97,4219.014,4244.773,I agree with the intention of this and I just want to make sure we are not creating any unintended consequences and being overly Perscriptive because all of the bills will go through the bill that we are passing today.,112,,
573,0.97,4244.773,4260.923,"Not the final stop for anyone having additional requirements put upon them for each of these transitional Encampments, there is the way they will go through.",112,,
574,0.97,4260.923,4261.757,Appropriate amount of security.,112,,
575,0.97,4261.757,4266.228,Support case management and four walls and a roof that an individual can walk.,112,,
576,0.97,4266.228,4277.973,I think that this amendment might need a little more time and happily support you for Councilmember Pedersen.,112,,
577,0.97,4277.973,4278.574,All right.,113,,
578,0.97,4278.574,4279.074,Councilmember Morales.,113,,
579,0.97,4279.074,4288.784,I want to call attention to two important words in this description.,114,,
580,0.97,4288.784,4292.721,"This is about transitional Encampments, by nature of what we are trying to do here.",114,,
581,0.97,4292.721,4313.475,This is a process that is--that is creating a first step hopefully for people who get off of the street and into a situation and environment where there is more opportunity for people to be together and to start to build the kind of community it could lead to the development of tiny village.,114,,
582,0.97,4313.475,4324.753,It is important to consider that this kind of requirement brings with it huge costs.,114,,
583,0.97,4324.753,4333.195,And having these fixed structures would create issue that we are trying to address that is to help people get off of the street.,114,,
584,0.97,4333.195,4339.401,"So, these kinds of Encampments are how we address the issue of homelessness in our city.",114,,
585,0.97,4339.401,4347.443,And it is not the permanent supportive housing or the low income housing or the warm place we would like people to have necessarily.,114,,
586,0.97,4347.443,4348.711,It is a step in that direction.,114,,
587,0.97,4348.711,4359.321,"And I think it is important that we allow for, you know, folks in whatever place they are in to get into a situation where they have a little more stability.",114,,
588,0.97,4359.321,4369.598,Even if it means they are getting there in a tent and we allow for the evolution of that encampment to become a tiny home village.,114,,
589,0.97,4369.598,4378.073,"So, I think we need to think more carefully before passing this amendment.",114,,
590,0.97,4378.073,4380.342,Councilmember Sawant.,115,,
591,0.97,4380.342,4386.949,"Thank you, chair.",116,,
592,0.97,4386.949,4401.797,"Just what Councilmember said, it is the community and the support and that kind of humanity you get from having people around you that allows you to move towards a village with four wall structure.",117,,
593,0.97,4401.797,4404.967,It is not just about the structure.,117,,
594,0.97,4404.967,4413.976,The evolution comes out when you have that community of encampment.,117,,
595,0.97,4413.976,4414.276,Thank you.,117,,
596,0.97,4414.276,4416.612,Thank you so much.,118,,
597,0.97,4416.612,4419.181,Are there any final comments?,118,,
598,0.97,4419.181,4419.515,Seeing none.,118,,
599,0.97,4419.515,4425.154,-- just to speak to some of Councilmember Strauss'Concerns.,118,,
600,0.97,4425.154,4435.197,"I forget, I forget I am sorry that you raised concerns about that amendment as well.",118,,
601,0.97,4435.197,4450.946,And actually after you flagged your concerns and it is a little more complicated with how the security requirement is phrased in Hsd's current contracting when they do have a security requirement.,118,,
602,0.97,4450.946,4454.183,It is part of the standard to get the Hsd money.,118,,
603,0.97,4454.183,4458.42,You have to have a certain amount of security.,118,,
604,0.97,4458.42,4460.189,We should have security.,119,,
605,0.97,4460.189,4460.622,"Yes, certainly.",120,,
606,0.97,4460.622,4466.028,My understanding had been that the Hr-Rpbl in the a Phupbdment reflected current practices.,120,,
607,0.97,4466.028,4469.064,That might not be quite as clear the way it is phrased right now.,120,,
608,0.97,4469.064,4481.109,I would like to work over the course of the next week on making sure that we aren't establishing a big hurdle above and beyond what they do.,120,,
609,0.97,4481.109,4491.119,I don't want us to create barriers to like pure based security systems that some of the more democratically governed Encampments might use.,120,,
610,0.97,4491.119,4502.231,I agree that it requires a little more time just to make sure that it is not too burden some and not introducing something extremely fundamentally new.,120,,
611,0.97,4502.231,4508.837,"So, based on that I am going to vote against this now.",120,,
612,0.97,4508.837,4517.412,I want to work with Councilmember Pedersen and others over the course of the next week to get language that reflects what we are trying to get at here.,120,,
613,0.97,4517.412,4517.679,Okay.,121,,
614,0.97,4517.679,4537.799,"So, I will call to question at this point, all of those in favor of this amendment signify by a vote of 5-1 the amendment fails.",122,,
615,0.97,4537.799,4545.507,I have withdrawn for similar reasons I just discussed amendment 5. Lewis amendment 3.,123,,
616,0.97,4545.507,4552.281,"Moving on to amendment 6. the Lewis amendment 2. this one is a little more straightforward, I think.",123,,
617,0.97,4552.281,4555.617,I am going to move it first.,123,,
618,0.97,4555.617,4559.321,I move this amendment for consideration.,123,,
619,0.97,4559.321,4564.259,And it is moved and Seconded.,123,,
620,0.97,4564.259,4572.834,"Speaking of, as a sponsor, you know, for the Encampments that operate with funding for the human services Department.",123,,
621,0.97,4572.834,4578.206,It is all of the current Encampments in Seattle.,123,,
622,0.97,4578.206,4588.317,There are Metrics that go that are attached to that money.,123,,
623,0.97,4588.317,4591.353,The language is there.,123,,
624,0.97,4591.353,4603.665,This is purely sort of a clarifying amendment.,123,,
625,0.97,4603.665,4613.275,It does not function alley change anything States the reality that the human performance Metrics to the funding that goes with it.,123,,
626,0.97,4613.275,4621.249,I think this is an important amendment for a couple of reasons.,123,,
627,0.97,4621.249,4622.05,And public facing standpoint.,123,,
628,0.97,4622.05,4629.891,Good for the region and good for the people of the city.,123,,
629,0.97,4629.891,4637.499,Performance Metrics that are attached to the tiny House village.,123,,
630,0.97,4637.499,4668.096,"Transitional Encampments, we heard it when we heard it from the site committee from Steinberg, the port of Seattle, from Sharon Lee, from a person who experienced homelessness and got through supportive housing through our village that the providers that operate these transition Allen Campments they are pretty good at providing the data and the met Reubgs provided by Hsd.",123,,
631,0.97,4668.096,4688.884,I think that it would be appropriate just to kind of recognize that it is a practice and to insulate ourselves from public criticism from people who might say otherwise.,123,,
632,0.97,4688.884,4693.121,Ordinance given it is simplicity.,123,,
633,0.97,4693.121,4693.955,Any other further discussion.,123,,
634,0.97,4693.955,4695.19,I want to support this.,124,,
635,0.97,4695.19,4705.067,I do want to point out and see how we follow up with Hsd and the met Rix.,124,,
636,0.97,4705.067,4716.378,"I don't think using it is an important Metrick when the permanent housing, low income housing to move people does not exist.",124,,
637,0.97,4716.378,4719.881,"So, I just want to flag that as another conversation that we need to continue to have.",124,,
638,0.97,4719.881,4724.753,Thank you very much for those comments.,125,,
639,0.97,4724.753,4725.654,I completely agree.,125,,
640,0.97,4725.654,4727.889,Are there any additional comments from the committee?,125,,
641,0.97,4727.889,4736.465,I just want to say I strongly agree with what Councilmember Morales just said.,126,,
642,0.97,4736.465,4740.635,Functional rather than something that does not make sense.,126,,
643,0.97,4740.635,4748.443,I intend it to be a pig part of the committee over the next year.,126,,
644,0.97,4748.443,4748.643,Okay.,126,,
645,0.97,4748.643,4757.586,If there is no final questions just take a vote.,126,,
646,0.97,4757.586,4767.429,"With 6 in favor, none opposed the amendment passes.",126,,
647,0.97,4767.429,4775.871,Amendment number 7. this is Councilmember number 1. is there a motion.,126,,
648,0.97,4775.871,4777.072,I move it.,127,,
649,0.97,4777.072,4779.207,I second.,127,,
650,0.97,4779.207,4781.343,Thank you.,128,,
651,0.97,4781.343,4816.611,This amendment is intended to address needed geographic Imparity to make sure Encampments are where they are most needed and not concentrated within certain communities it requires they are cited evenly among districts one mile is maintained.,129,,
652,0.97,4816.611,4822.717,"As I described earlier, currently there are 6 that are permitted under the temporary use permit.",129,,
653,0.97,4822.717,4833.962,Assuming they all move to be permitted under this ordinance.,129,,
654,0.97,4833.962,4838.9,6 districts that have Encampments in them.,129,,
655,0.97,4838.9,4839.634,Only one will not.,129,,
656,0.97,4839.634,4847.509,This 1 mile will only be in effect until the last district that does not currently have an encampment has one.,129,,
657,0.97,4847.509,4860.822,"The intent here, again, not--it is to ensure new Encampments are not concentrated in communities that are generously hosting Encampments and that Encampments are available throughout the entire city.",129,,
658,0.97,4860.822,4865.093,Because we have homeless people who are living outside throughout the entire city.,129,,
659,0.97,4865.093,4871.7,The intent is to bring resources to people where they are.,129,,
660,0.97,4871.7,4878.273,One of the points that we heard in public comment that I asked central staff to speak to.,129,,
661,0.97,4878.273,4881.676,It is how this will inner play.,129,,
662,0.97,4881.676,4885.08,With transition Allen Campments as they are defined.,129,,
663,0.97,4885.08,4892.988,Defined in such a way to include safe parking.,129,,
664,0.97,4892.988,4910.038,Currently the safe parking lots within the city are all under the religion permitting legislation.,129,,
665,0.97,4910.038,4910.338,Because --,129,,
666,0.97,4910.338,4929.19,"-- sure--so, whether or not you are a safe parking encampment or you are a tent encampment or tiny House village encampment you would not be subject to it.",130,,
667,0.97,4929.19,4942.537,It would be exempt because they are based on the pact that they are fulfilling their mission under their religion exemption.,130,,
668,0.97,4942.537,4955.317,It only relates to Encampments that are under this Ordphapbs and under the temporary use process.,130,,
669,0.97,4955.317,4970.999,"Finally, my district has been home specifically one neighborhood in particular has been home to camp second chance for a number of years and for several years before that they were home to Nicholsville.",130,,
670,0.97,4970.999,4976.338,Both at the current second chance as well as down the hill.,130,,
671,0.97,4976.338,4992.887,And it is really important to the folks in that neighborhood to see that tiny House villages and other types of transitional Encampments are located in other parts of the district.,130,,
672,0.97,4992.887,4997.292,The neighborhood I am speaking of is a low income district.,130,,
673,0.97,4997.292,5023.952,Low income neighborhood and it is really important to them in recognition of their generous hosting for six years now between the 2 Encampments that other parts of district 1 also host transitional Encampments.,130,,
674,0.97,5023.952,5025.286,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",131,,
675,0.97,5025.286,5025.82,Councilmember Sawant?,132,,
676,0.97,5025.82,5040.402,"First of all, two points, one is on--thank you for clarifying which types of Encampments would be covered under this amendment because of the underlying bill.",133,,
677,0.97,5040.402,5049.01,"Even under that if--as you pointed out one district that does not have it, District 5.",133,,
678,0.97,5049.01,5064.459,"So, in other words if--until that district got this permitting process got an encampment no knew ones could be permitted under --",133,,
679,0.97,5064.459,5072.3,No permitted but they would have to be a mile away from the District encampment in the district.,134,,
680,0.97,5072.3,5072.567,Okay.,135,,
681,0.97,5072.567,5075.904,So the two parts of the amendment that are related to each other.,135,,
682,0.97,5075.904,5076.838,That is right.,136,,
683,0.97,5076.838,5082.51,Thank you for clarifying that.,137,,
684,0.97,5082.51,5095.19,I just wanted to point out that there are two--actually I will hold my points.,137,,
685,0.97,5095.19,5095.79,Councilmember Morales.,138,,
686,0.97,5095.79,5100.361,I think my question got answered but I will ask it any way.,138,,
687,0.97,5100.361,5104.599,I appreciate the effort to get better geographic distribution.,139,,
688,0.97,5104.599,5125.186,I think it is important and the cynic in me is recalling the very heated conversations we have had in this city about homeless people and what neighborhoods should get them and--invite them in and which ones don't want to do that.,139,,
689,0.97,5125.186,5130.892,My concern would be that we have a huge need.,139,,
690,0.97,5130.892,5157.519,That there is a barrier if one community insists on not allowing an encampment in and we need more Encampments that they would not be allowed to get--to become established and sort of this pull and push of a clear need and an inability to move forward?,139,,
691,0.97,5157.519,5176.538,"So, my best attempt to respond to that, the intent of this amendment is to ensure that communities that are not currently hosts to Encampments have a chance to do so.",140,,
692,0.97,5176.538,5187.215,That is where this is coming from.,140,,
693,0.97,5187.215,5190.752,Residents surrounding the hosted Encampments in district 1. they are frustrated.,140,,
694,0.97,5190.752,5197.659,None of the neighborhoods on the West side of 35th have been a host and that is what we are trying to get at here.,140,,
695,0.97,5197.659,5225.053,"Again, to go back to the earlier point this does not limit the citing within districts just that one mile Dispwurgz of each other.",140,,
696,0.97,5225.053,5232.293,I believe district 7 is host to tiny House villages currently.,141,,
697,0.97,5232.293,5262.123,"We heard some presentation on the one on port of Seattle land, we heard from the Commissioner that that encampment is popular with the businesses in the Kraeur and it was not when it was cited there, they are great neighbors, a lot of the community has been dedicated to protecting and expanding that tiny House village and stories like that have been Replicated all over the city.",141,,
698,0.97,5262.123,5269.197,I am very proud of the work that folks in the tiny House villages have done.,141,,
699,0.97,5269.197,5279.607,To be exceptional neighbors and to someone who is to Encampments I can attest to that.,141,,
700,0.97,5279.607,5282.744,I do agree with Councilmember Herbold's underlining drive for this amendment.,141,,
701,0.97,5282.744,5292.086,I do think it is fair for us to require more geographic equity and how we distribute placement of the Encampments.,141,,
702,0.97,5292.086,5309.003,"I think that it is reasonable to expect that every Council should have at least one and we should attach one, the buffer zone to the citing of future camp.",141,,
703,0.97,5309.003,5311.606,One reason I am voting for it.,141,,
704,0.97,5311.606,5320.848,"The one mile separation, I believe, a component for the prior ordinance language.",141,,
705,0.97,5320.848,5330.425,"Under the old interim permitting language, all of the current ones will be Grandfathered in.",141,,
706,0.97,5330.425,5334.929,It would have been a primary concern.,141,,
707,0.97,5334.929,5347.809,"Based on that, I think that this is a good way to build in a little more geographic intent here.",141,,
708,0.97,5347.809,5348.91,Councilmember Herbold you have the last word.,141,,
709,0.97,5348.91,5352.113,I am happy to call for the vote.,142,,
710,0.97,5352.113,5353.548,Allow you to call for the vote.,142,,
711,0.97,5353.548,5359.02,The vote should be called for.,143,,
712,0.97,5359.02,5373.401,All of those in favor of the amendment two votes opposed.,143,,
713,0.97,5373.401,5375.169,2-2 the amendment passes.,143,,
714,0.97,5375.169,5379.04,I am going to ask questions.,144,,
715,0.97,5379.04,5381.709,"Next, will be amendment 8.",145,,
716,0.97,5381.709,5385.279,Herbold's number 2. the one on the set back requirement.,145,,
717,0.97,5385.279,5392.42,Do you want a motion to consider your amendment?,145,,
718,0.97,5392.42,5394.555,I move Herbold amendment 2.,146,,
719,0.97,5394.555,5394.856,Second.,147,,
720,0.97,5394.856,5396.424,Thank you.,148,,
721,0.97,5396.424,5422.583,As center staff mentioned in the opening remarks the existing legislation includes the legislation that is before us without amendments includes a removal of the existing 25 foot set back from residential zones.,148,,
722,0.97,5422.583,5431.659,That has been the standard 25 foot set back.,148,,
723,0.97,5431.659,5434.295,This is a 10-foot set back.,148,,
724,0.97,5434.295,5437.965,Not across the board only when there is an established use.,148,,
725,0.97,5437.965,5452.513,"So, if the law does not have an established use there is no set back required.",148,,
726,0.97,5452.513,5459.22,If the established use is a residential use the set back is 10 feet instead of the existing 25 feet.,148,,
727,0.97,5459.22,5463.491,"Other zones, a 5 foot set back is required.",148,,
728,0.97,5463.491,5474.635,"Again, if there is no established use in the law, no set back.",148,,
729,0.97,5474.635,5496.424,"This is a lower standard than is currently required but, also looking at the scenarios that we have in existence it is consistent with the current practice in the few scenarios where there are current Encampments are using different permitting types.",148,,
730,0.97,5496.424,5514.108,"Sinceel family zone properties, Encampments are observing a 5 foot or a 10 foot set back on lot lines, it allows for appropriate breathing room between lot usage and residential zones.",148,,
731,0.97,5514.108,5519.247,While still significant Moaningful space.,148,,
732,0.97,5519.247,5519.947,Thank you.,149,,
733,0.97,5519.947,5522.817,Any comments on Councilmember Herbold's amendment.,150,,
734,0.97,5522.817,5537.999,I don't necessarily oppose in general the idea that has been put forward as a whole for the city.,151,,
735,0.97,5537.999,5545.339,"Those standards that extremely, trying to make it more flexible for tiny home villages to be set up.",151,,
736,0.97,5545.339,5551.579,I don't know why we have to be Perscriptive in this.,151,,
737,0.97,5551.579,5554.181,They have tall wooden solid fence around them.,151,,
738,0.97,5554.181,5558.619,If you--for example you are walking alongside.,151,,
739,0.97,5558.619,5560.321,There are two in my district.,151,,
740,0.97,5560.321,5563.758,I pass by them virtually every day.,151,,
741,0.97,5563.758,5567.361,You hardly--they are hardly visible.,151,,
742,0.97,5567.361,5573.634,I don't honestly think that the neighbors care about the setbacks.,151,,
743,0.97,5573.634,5576.07,The neighbors are welcoming them in general.,151,,
744,0.97,5576.07,5586.247,"And so, just in the spirit of trying to keep it as easy as possible I don't think we should do it.",151,,
745,0.97,5586.247,5588.549,Seeing none.,152,,
746,0.97,5588.549,5592.386,I am raising my hand.,153,,
747,0.97,5592.386,5592.653,Okay.,154,,
748,0.97,5592.653,5592.853,Sure.,154,,
749,0.97,5592.853,5593.054,Yes.,154,,
750,0.97,5593.054,5593.587,"Go, ahead, yes, please.",154,,
751,0.97,5593.587,5594.655,Thank you.,155,,
752,0.97,5594.655,5602.763,I just want to remind the committee we are not permitting tiny House villages.,156,,
753,0.97,5602.763,5606.367,We are permitting temporary Encampments.,156,,
754,0.97,5606.367,5620.247,So the standards that you see currently as it relates specifically to tiny House villages are not part of the legislation and without requiring some sort of buffer we should not expect them to exist.,156,,
755,0.97,5620.247,5624.385,Are there any additional comments.,157,,
756,0.97,5624.385,5624.719,Seeing none.,157,,
757,0.97,5624.719,5627.188,I do intend to vote to pass this amendment.,157,,
758,0.97,5627.188,5635.062,Part of the reason is I don't think there is any language in the current ordinance related to setbacks.,157,,
759,0.97,5635.062,5643.404,I would just remind everybody that in the old authorizing ordinance there was language related to setbacks.,157,,
760,0.97,5643.404,5654.649,Primarily for residential zones I don't think that 25 set back would be appropriate any longer since we are expanding.,157,,
761,0.97,5654.649,5667.294,I do think that this more modest set back language that is put in does anticipate the different setbacks appropriate for different uses.,157,,
762,0.97,5667.294,5682.476,"It is a good way to proceed with the vision we expand the available sites for transitional Encampments, a set back is appropriate.",157,,
763,0.97,5682.476,5685.579,It gets through some of the potential concerns.,157,,
764,0.97,5685.579,5688.582,And there are any other comments?,157,,
765,0.97,5688.582,5688.783,Okay.,157,,
766,0.97,5688.783,5693.521,Herbold you have the last word if there is anything else you wanted to add.,157,,
767,0.97,5693.521,5695.356,I am sorry.,158,,
768,0.97,5695.356,5697.358,I could of waited.,158,,
769,0.97,5697.358,5699.493,That is what I was --,159,,
770,0.97,5699.493,5704.265,I was not reading your nonverbal language.,160,,
771,0.97,5704.265,5707.068,I was busy tying my shoes.,161,,
772,0.97,5707.068,5712.373,"No closeout comments, thank you.",162,,
773,0.97,5712.373,5726.887,"Okay, thanks, with that said, signify 4 in favor, 2 against, the amendment passes.",163,,
774,0.97,5726.887,5735.262,And that is all of the amendments that are before this Committee for consideration today.,163,,
775,0.97,5735.262,5752.646,"So before we adjourn--well, actually, before we proceed to adjournment let's do a vote on the bill if there is a motion.",163,,
776,0.97,5752.646,5753.114,Councilmember Sawant.,163,,
777,0.97,5753.114,5756.117,I move to vote on 119656.,164,,
778,0.97,5756.117,5756.717,It is moved.,165,,
779,0.97,5756.717,5757.918,Is it Seconded.,165,,
780,0.97,5757.918,5759.92,Second.,166,,
781,0.97,5759.92,5761.222,It is moved and Seconded.,167,,
782,0.97,5761.222,5770.831,Sawant do you want to speak to your ordinance bill?,167,,
783,0.97,5770.831,5771.232,Just briefly.,168,,
784,0.97,5771.232,5784.345,I appreciate all of the Councilmembers engaging in the discussion and Councilmember Lewis you accommodating this as a priority item in your new Committee as soon as you took office.,168,,
785,0.97,5784.345,5788.949,"And, just to reiterate very quickly, just we all agree.",168,,
786,0.97,5788.949,5791.285,We do have to be clear.,168,,
787,0.97,5791.285,5800.528,None of us who have been advocating for it.,168,,
788,0.97,5800.528,5808.536,In the needs of homeless while Homesness exists there is absolutely no justification for people to be left unsheltered.,168,,
789,0.97,5808.536,5812.306,"We know it has devastating, devastating consequences.",168,,
790,0.97,5812.306,5818.445,And I know we do not talk about Encampments and tiny houses.,168,,
791,0.97,5818.445,5830.858,"We should acknowledge and congratulate you on incredible the efforts have been from the community and from our organization, social service organizations.",168,,
792,0.97,5830.858,5837.031,"From 10 Encampments to tiny villages, I think we should amend the effort that is being made to go.",168,,
793,0.97,5837.031,5842.303,And we are not going to be worth it.,168,,
794,0.97,5842.303,5845.806,The tiny House bridge to permit housing.,168,,
795,0.97,5845.806,5858.385,"None of it, for two final points, the bill's passage is important but again we will still have to fight to fund additional villages.",168,,
796,0.97,5858.385,5862.323,Having the ability to do it and having the money is another.,168,,
797,0.97,5862.323,5876.67,"We will continue that struggle and on top of that really, we need paramount struggle it is for affordable housing.",168,,
798,0.97,5876.67,5878.005,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",169,,
799,0.97,5878.005,5878.572,"Yes, Councilmember Morales.",169,,
800,0.97,5878.572,5881.408,I would have to say I am frustrated.,170,,
801,0.97,5881.408,5886.48,Today we have the privilege to vote on 2 bills to combat it.,170,,
802,0.97,5886.48,5897.157,One to keep our neighbors housed and this one to house more of our neighbors to be impacted by a system that Criminalizes poverty.,170,,
803,0.97,5897.157,5906.667,"In the week since our last meeting, two weeks ago, we had a chance to meet with constituents who want to see a Pathway out of homelessness.",170,,
804,0.97,5906.667,5919.88,We met and heard stories of mothers finding community after losing their homes of neighbors coming out of homelessness to devote their lives for fighting for the rights of people who face similar situations.,170,,
805,0.97,5919.88,5927.788,"And, I say all of that because at our last committee meeting we collectively decided to delay there vote until today.",170,,
806,0.97,5927.788,5934.128,So that Councilmembers could research issues more and potentially submit amendments for others to consider.,170,,
807,0.97,5934.128,5937.064,We did not see these until yesterday at 3:00 P.M.,170,,
808,0.97,5937.064,5940.801,That is when they were shared with Council colleagues.,170,,
809,0.97,5940.801,5951.845,"Offering these amendments at that late of a time is neither transparent or efficient, not to mention we had several staff members here working over the weekend.",170,,
810,0.97,5951.845,5956.483,Giving less than a day seems to defeat the purpose of delaying the vote in the first place.,170,,
811,0.97,5956.483,5962.289,If my opinion it will delay the process again and I am not on board with that.,170,,
812,0.97,5962.289,5973.801,I don't think that we should keep kicking the can down the road on these important pieces of legislation if we have amendments we want to research we need to get it done and stop pushing things off.,170,,
813,0.97,5973.801,6005.833,"So, you know, it sends a message to our homeless neighbors about our priority and it is important for the sake of transparency to our city that we if we are going to delay a vote we move faster and for the sake of us as Councilmembers to do our due diligence and understanding these 6 or eight amendments on this bill, the 6 or 8 on the bill that we spoke about earlier it is important that we have more than, you know, 12 hours to look at these amendments and really understand them if we are expected to vote on them.",170,,
814,0.97,6005.833,6006.3,Thank you.,171,,
815,0.97,6006.3,6010.704,Just to respond to some of those.,172,,
816,0.97,6010.704,6012.639,I do agree with Councilmember Morales.,172,,
817,0.97,6012.639,6026.687,"I would say that part of going through preparing for this, I mean, some of sponsored were not at a place where they were ready for prime time until close to the vote Unfortunately.",172,,
818,0.97,6026.687,6030.457,"Part of that reflects on we are dealing with a unique deadline, too.",172,,
819,0.97,6030.457,6035.295,That is why I am moving it as quickly as possible.,172,,
820,0.97,6035.295,6038.232,"So, the current interim permitting language does expire on March 31st.",172,,
821,0.97,6038.232,6052.413,The goal with the time line we lined up is just to make it in time to make sure the providers have enough leeway where it is not going to lead to potential displacement or Eviction ever the Encampments.,172,,
822,0.97,6052.413,6065.726,"That is partly why, I called a special meeting.",172,,
823,0.97,6065.726,6067.594,Trying to have enough meet up.,172,,
824,0.97,6067.594,6074.468,Especially a committee of the whole member Shr-P in advance of the votes on these.,172,,
825,0.97,6074.468,6078.705,Especially this particular ordinance involved a lot of technical amendments today.,172,,
826,0.97,6078.705,6079.873,I do apologize for that.,172,,
827,0.97,6079.873,6097.224,I hope in the run up to what I am sure will be a few more amendments that will be considered for Council next Monday that we can work to try to get more notice of those Amenitiments before we vote on them.,172,,
828,0.97,6097.224,6097.858,But I do.,172,,
829,0.97,6097.858,6107.968,To meet that March 31st deadline I do intend to push the Council to move this next Wednesday.,172,,

834,0.97,6120.981,6123.784,That is right it will be Tuesday.,174,,
835,0.97,6123.784,6129.69,And this bill has a signature block from 2019 that needs to be changed.,175,,
836,0.97,6129.69,6135.395,I want to Revisit your amendment number 7 to make sure the committee's intent is reflected in the language.,176,,

840,0.97,6156.617,6160.487,We considered a slew of amendments.,178,,
841,0.97,6160.487,6172.199,It is difficult for those of us that are sponsoring the bills in we have to look at all of that and make sure that our community members are able to come and engage in it.,178,,
842,0.97,6172.199,6175.068,So can we set Wednesday or Wednesday morning deadline.,178,,

846,0.97,6185.812,6208.936,"If we can potentially maybe have a summary of those amendments by the close of business on Friday so we have the full weekend to consider, the full 3 day weekend to consider the amendments and kind of dwell on them and take a look at them that would be advisable as well.",181,,
847,0.97,6208.936,6211.872,I know it is asking a lot.,181,,
848,0.97,6211.872,6220.28,And Monday noon deadline or I guess it would be noon Tuesday deadline for amendments.,181,,

858,0.97,6257.217,6260.754,I think it is a strong ordinance.,182,,
859,0.97,6260.754,6267.394,The strength of it represented by the changes being cosmetic today.,182,,
860,0.97,6267.394,6283.644,The amendments we considered substance of the use of permitting.,182,,
861,0.97,6283.644,6286.146,And the strength of producing the ordinance.,182,,

876,0.97,6373.934,6376.503,And a chance to review it.,185,,
877,0.97,6376.503,6382.609,It is expressing the town's intent for the home of a good pilot it is funded for 12 months.,185,,
878,0.97,6382.609,6394.254,Home for good is the name of the pilot in development right now to prevent or end homelessness for over 50 years old who are living on Federal disability benefits.,185,,
879,0.97,6394.254,6403.563,Often the benefit they receive is inadequate to cover the cost of rent and still leave enough left over to live on even in subsidized housing.,185,,
880,0.97,6403.563,6412.372,This leaves this population vulnerable to Eviction and homelessness.,185,,
881,0.97,6412.372,6418.478,Even when they are housed in subsidized housing.,185,,
882,0.97,6418.478,6432.893,"750,000 to create and evaluate a project to provide substantial subsidy.",185,,
883,0.97,6432.893,6443.203,And for the budget requirement and there is some confusion in that Stakeholder meeting if the funding will be extended by December 31st as a hard deadline.,185,,
884,0.97,6443.203,6446.74,If that was the case it would make for a short pilot.,185,,
885,0.97,6446.74,6454.514,"Since the human services Department is still in the process of both developing the program, developing an Rfp.",185,,
886,0.97,6454.514,6458.251,They will issue an Rpf.,185,,
887,0.97,6458.251,6466.293,They will receive applications and then they will select an Awardee and enter into contract.,185,,
