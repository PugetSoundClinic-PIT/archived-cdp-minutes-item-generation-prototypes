142,0.97,679.645,682.515,I came here because of the American dream.,11,,
143,0.97,682.515,690.456,This is to wake up every morning and know that today going to be better than yesterday.,11,,

145,0.97,695.494,697.596,I don't know how it happens.,11,,

165,0.97,765.664,767.333,We always have and always will.,15,,
166,0.97,767.333,780.045,"However, any ride share minimum earning standard that involves an ongoing Jutelyization rate as part of the measurement of that earning standard is a Nonstarter for us.",15,,
167,0.97,780.045,784.316,The similar system being proposed here in Seattle was enacted in New York City.,15,,
168,0.97,784.316,796.595,"In New York City, it caused the companies to restrict access to the platforms for the drivers resulting in nearly 16,000 drivers losing their jobs.",15,,
169,0.97,796.595,810.209,"Those drivers that couldn't meet high trip standards and forced by the companies were only given 11 scheduled hours per weekend, not enough to earn a living wage.",15,,
170,0.97,810.209,819.852,"According to reports in Vice.Com and other news sources, drivers reported working longer hours and making less money under this type of system.",15,,
171,0.97,819.852,829.762,They also reported sleeping in their cars just to make sure they got enough trips to meet the high trip standards to maintain access to the Apps.,15,,
172,0.97,829.762,834.066,This is not a system that will work in Seattle.,15,,
173,0.97,834.066,838.337,We want to make sure that the Council understands.,15,,
174,0.97,838.337,855.12,We would ask them to remove ongoing driver utilization rates from this system.,15,,
175,0.97,855.12,855.421,Thank you.,15,,

202,0.97,952.251,956.922,We know the drivers deeply.,18,,

395,0.97,1842.974,1852.684,Drivers with overwhelming majority of people of color and immigrants are earning far below the minimum wage disrupting and extremely exploited pay structure moves us a step towards the larger goal of dismantling racism in our city and country.,35,,

432,0.97,1994.592,2000.732,I'm a Lyft driver and support the Union drivers demand for fair pay raise.,39,,
433,0.97,2000.732,2006.637,"First, I would like to thank all the people from the community who are helping us today.",39,,
434,0.97,2006.637,2010.775,I hear their voices now talking and it's really helping.,39,,
435,0.97,2010.775,2024.055,All I want to say that we are working for the community and we're doing what we can to help out and we're happy doing it.,39,,
436,0.97,2024.055,2031.329,"With the time on everything, we're not getting paid enough for what we're doing.",39,,
437,0.97,2031.329,2036.334,I'm struggling this week with my daughter's birthday.,39,,

441,0.97,2047.478,2068.499,I hope that this time please you really consider just to make some to see how we cannot make this living with these wages.,39,,

447,0.97,2077.375,2093.524,I'm calling today to add my voice to all voices that called in today about the fair pay for drivers.,40,,
448,0.97,2093.524,2116.047,It is I think more important than any other time we would fight for all drivers that are delivering our front line workers.,40,,
449,0.97,2116.047,2121.786,Also employees because that's pretty much what we are.,40,,
450,0.97,2121.786,2129.093,Driving over the area for both on Lyft I experienced.,40,,
451,0.97,2129.093,2138.97,I pretty much watched my day get slashed in half.,40,,

457,0.97,2154.218,2155.286,My name is Haley.,40,,
458,0.97,2155.286,2159.69,I've been driving since October 2017.,40,,
459,0.97,2159.69,2163.227,I do not support the Ordnance whatsoever.,40,,
460,0.97,2163.227,2168.566,I second to what Mr. Wolf said who is with drive forward.,40,,
461,0.97,2168.566,2174.839,This does not correct our pay if our flexibility is compromised because of it.,40,,
462,0.97,2174.839,2178.843,I believe there's a different way to accomplish the same thing.,40,,
463,0.97,2178.843,2189.954,I'm not against higher pay but I'm against this type of pay that's going to undermine the fabric of the business model of Lyft and Uber.,40,,
464,0.97,2189.954,2191.122,It makes it unsustainable long term.,40,,
465,0.97,2191.122,2196.16,I don't feel I should get paid when I'm not quote working.,40,,
466,0.97,2196.16,2201.032,It could threaten the fact Lyft and Uber says it's not sustainable and going to leave Seattle.,40,,
467,0.97,2201.032,2203.834,Then no one is going to get paid.,40,,
468,0.97,2203.834,2216.614,It has the about to only date tore 5% of drivers that are working 40 hours plus.,40,,
469,0.97,2216.614,2218.049,Please continue.,40,,
470,0.97,2218.049,2226.49,"Oh, so I don't feel like it is an overall solution that's going to help 95% of the drivers.",41,,
471,0.97,2226.49,2231.596,"Because of that, I'm all about fair pay but not.",41,,
472,0.97,2231.596,2235.132,It's deceptive of understanding what it really does.,41,,
473,0.97,2235.132,2242.239,There's better solutions to accomplish the same things.,41,,
474,0.97,2242.239,2242.74,Thank you very much.,42,,
475,0.97,2242.74,2253.117,The next perk is Bob.,42,,

493,0.97,2310.541,2316.28,Uber's Commission was 20% of what the customer pay.,44,,
494,0.97,2316.28,2318.549,The customer did not complain about the price.,44,,
495,0.97,2318.549,2324.889,"They were happy to get a ride within five minutes in a nice, clean car.",44,,
496,0.97,2324.889,2332.563,"Today Uber takes 30%, many times more of the customer's fair.",44,,
497,0.97,2332.563,2341.472,"Uber had a fair price then, and I'm sure they can give us a fair price today.",44,,

517,0.97,2408.672,2415.079,Unfortunately I was tired of dealing with the bureaucracy and not expressing myself fully.,47,,
518,0.97,2415.079,2422.052,I'm able to continue that social work as a driver.,47,,
519,0.97,2422.052,2424.188,I do that at my own time.,47,,
520,0.97,2424.188,2431.896,"Since then, I have fallen in love owning any own business and making good money.",47,,
521,0.97,2431.896,2440.471,However the government is imposing will on us Stricting hours of operation.,47,,
522,0.97,2440.471,2443.274,"Please consider our independence, our freedom, flexibility.",47,,

531,0.97,2468.299,2477.474,I think this fair share initiative of the Mayor is waste of public resources and a curse to the drivers.,50,,
532,0.97,2477.474,2485.449,I just see white people playing around with poor ignorant drivers dividing them into groups.,50,,
533,0.97,2485.449,2490.054,I think that mark your calendar next year at this time.,50,,
534,0.97,2490.054,2502.466,This fair share will bring no material Xized benefit to the driver and only leave us in more debt.,50,,
535,0.97,2502.466,2505.836,We are slaves of Uber and community.,50,,
536,0.97,2505.836,2514.478,The Mayor's office is the master here making sure that we don't reach our maximum potential.,50,,
537,0.97,2514.478,2526.49,Therefore we do not support this fair share act in whole.,50,,
538,0.97,2526.49,2535.199,Thank you very much.,51,,

553,0.97,2580.544,2587.184,I'm asking to city Council to consider and not support this fair share.,52,,
554,0.97,2587.184,2599.063,"This is rushing to the way the Mayor introduced that Mayor divided drivers Cherry picking creating a coalition, nothing to do with the driver issue.",52,,
555,0.97,2599.063,2614.078,We are asking for--we have asked way back September last year to give us a chance and our concern is we are not being given chance to Peek with Council.,52,,

568,0.97,2650.147,2658.022,I am making a comment about the transfer of the building.,53,,
569,0.97,2658.022,2667.531,"Bird bar has been providing food, energy, housing, home repair, personal finances and such for some time.",53,,
570,0.97,2667.531,2668.899,It's been essential to the community.,53,,
571,0.97,2668.899,2675.139,I can recall my family using bird bar services when I was a child.,53,,

573,0.97,2676.673,2686.75,"About let's say 20 something odd years later as an adult, I used bird bar services when I became a young single mother.",53,,
574,0.97,2686.75,2695.292,I believe bird bar has been providing services in the community for over 56 years.,53,,
575,0.97,2695.292,2705.836,Bird bar has been an anchor in this community and indispensable to black and low income families.,53,,
576,0.97,2705.836,2707.638,The transport is important.,53,,
577,0.97,2707.638,2716.68,The building is historic landmark and symbol of the black community's place in Seattle.,53,,

754,0.97,3686.582,3692.555,I think this helps set a phone for future conversations.,74,,
755,0.97,3692.555,3693.189,I shouldn't say conversations.,74,,
756,0.97,3693.189,3694.457,Future actions.,74,,
757,0.97,3694.457,3695.558,There's been much conversation about this effort.,74,,
758,0.97,3695.558,3699.462,I want to say this is one of many discussions to have.,74,,
759,0.97,3699.462,3710.239,It's a chance for folks to ask about process and anything we'd like to see improved or streamlined to help with future efforts would be really appreciative as well at this time.,74,,
760,0.97,3710.239,3720.616,We know that in late 2018 the council passed a resolution committing to collaborate with the executive to insure transfer of properties as Lish noted.,74,,
761,0.97,3720.616,3738.835,"This is our opportunity today to make sure the lease is in alignment with what the Council and Mayor discussed with the organization and while it is pass past our March 29 deadline we originally thought of as Andrea mentioned, excited to see this move forward today.",74,,
762,0.97,3738.835,3743.473,I look forward to the conversation Andic questions folks might have.,74,,
763,0.97,3743.473,3745.208,The first question I have for historical context.,74,,
764,0.97,3745.208,3756.085,Can you tell us more how it was that the community ended up having the fire station to begin with?,74,,
765,0.97,3756.085,3756.385,Sure.,74,,
766,0.97,3756.385,3759.922,It was a process where we looked around.,74,,
767,0.97,3759.922,3768.664,"It should be made known our Sibling organization, the urban League, we got started under them.",74,,
768,0.97,3768.664,3775.972,"Before we got our designation, not only our home but our presence and where we had programming was at the urban League building.",74,,
769,0.97,3775.972,3792.255,"We were looking around expanding and evolving our presence in the central District of Seattle where you know the majority of black folks lived in the 60s, we thought about being in Closs Promptty with our Sibling organizations.",74,,
770,0.97,3792.255,3794.957,"We identified a few schools, churches, synagogues.",74,,
771,0.97,3794.957,3797.193,We discovered the fire station was up for opportunity.,74,,
772,0.97,3797.193,3808.237,"We worked with the city and community advocates, with other nonprofit organizations, our elected officials.",74,,
773,0.97,3808.237,3814.043,It was determined that we could Repurpose fire station 23 to be used and supported with a grant from the state of Washington to do that.,74,,
774,0.97,3814.043,3817.213,It became our home in the late 60s.,74,,
775,0.97,3817.213,3822.485,Thank you for that.,75,,
776,0.97,3822.485,3828.391,Are there questions about this effort?,76,,
777,0.97,3828.391,3834.997,Any comments.,76,,
778,0.97,3834.997,3840.57,Thank you deputy Mayor for being with us.,76,,
779,0.97,3840.57,3848.511,Really appreciative of the community to consider this legislation today.,76,,
780,0.97,3848.511,3856.552,I had a quick question around the Mayor renovation project.,76,,
781,0.97,3856.552,3858.721,This is Referenced in Lish's memo.,76,,
782,0.97,3858.721,3861.724,It's the last paragraph of the Úsecond page.,76,,
783,0.97,3861.724,3878.808,"It does make a reference that bird bar place is working on a renovation project and in order to receive a state grant, bird bar has to control the property through ownership or a long term lease.",76,,
784,0.97,3878.808,3882.478,This Council bill will at least address that particular component.,76,,
785,0.97,3882.478,3886.315,I was wondering a couple of things.,76,,
786,0.97,3886.315,3894.29,"One, what are the state grant possibilities and if we could get a little more information on the record, that would be great.",76,,
787,0.97,3894.29,3923.085,"Secondly, if it's not state grant that's currently in the works or maybe it is, is there anything that the city needs to do in terms of our legislative agenda to Prioritize communicating to our state legislators and the governor, the passage of this bill and our ongoing support for the development of this project and effort?",76,,
788,0.97,3923.085,3924.887,Thank you for that.,76,,
789,0.97,3924.887,3927.456,That is what's driving the time line.,76,,
790,0.97,3927.456,3934.196,We have a building communities fund grant we were awarded in 2015 that we stand to lose.,76,,
791,0.97,3934.196,3937.033,Many of you might know it was extended.,76,,
792,0.97,3937.033,3942.571,Our legislators from 37th and the 43rd got together and helped extend the deadline.,76,,
793,0.97,3942.571,3950.313,"They will not--it's been communicating, Overcommunicated that will not be granted again.",76,,
794,0.97,3950.313,3953.482,"In addition to that, we have begun renovation plans.",76,,
795,0.97,3953.482,3972.001,"We've been looking at how to Retro fit the building, insure it survives the next earthquake and adding elevator, widening door ways and hallways to make it accessible and modernize the work space.",76,,
796,0.97,3972.001,3973.336,We have to access the $1.5 million.,76,,
797,0.97,3973.336,3977.84,We can't do that until we own the building.,76,,
798,0.97,3977.84,3992.254,So this action we're taking today and hopefully passes out of committee and onto the full Council and does pass full council will satisfy what the Department of Commerce needs in order for us to move guard with renovation and access funds.,76,,
799,0.97,3992.254,3993.556,Thank you for highlighting that.,76,,
800,0.97,3993.556,3993.923,Absolutely.,77,,
801,0.97,3993.923,4012.808,"Just really quickly so we're on the same page adds to that deadline, since it is going through the Council's legislative process, perhaps you or Lish or anyone on the line can remind us in the viewing public what that deadline is.",77,,
802,0.97,4012.808,4013.242,Yes.,78,,
803,0.97,4013.242,4014.343,It is October.,78,,
804,0.97,4014.343,4027.723,"We know 30 days after that, the we need to complete Paperworknd, and that satisfies the Department of Commerce's part.",78,,
805,0.97,4027.723,4028.991,Thank you.,79,,
806,0.97,4028.991,4029.658,Appreciate it.,79,,
807,0.97,4029.658,4033.229,Thank you Council President.,80,,
808,0.97,4033.229,4035.498,Additional comments or questions colleagues?,80,,
809,0.97,4035.498,4037.533,Council member Herbold and vice chair to this Committee.,80,,
810,0.97,4037.533,4037.9,The go ahead.,80,,
811,0.97,4037.9,4057.42,"I want to first say I'm really, really excited we're here to take this important step forward for the users of bird bar as well as the broader community.",81,,
812,0.97,4057.42,4080.543,"It is really important not only for placement and for community black led ownership of properties within the city, but it's also as Council President Gonzalez Referenced important for us to move forward on the needed investments in the building.",81,,
813,0.97,4080.543,4092.655,"So, this is just--I'm Estatic we're at this point today and thank the executive and thank the community members that have been pushing us to push you.",81,,
814,0.97,4092.655,4114.844,Just wondering if somebody on the panel could talk a little more about the--one of the terms of the agreement is negative's easement.,81,,
815,0.97,4114.844,4130.993,If necessary how would it be triggered and under what circumstances it might be triggered.,81,,
816,0.97,4130.993,4143.606,"Deputy Mayor, is that something--. I can speak to it.",81,,
817,0.97,4143.606,4160.356,I think the idea was provide flexibility for the organization and each site is going to be different to be able to continue to provide services and expand the services.,81,,
818,0.97,4160.356,4171.267,Also because many properties are located in communities that have seen.,81,,
819,0.97,4171.267,4183.979,"If a future opportunity arises for development, affordable housing, there's flexibility and agreements.",81,,
820,0.97,4183.979,4193.622,This allows the current structure to provide for affordable housing should there be a partnership with the city and nonprofit.,81,,
821,0.97,4193.622,4201.83,What triggers the council member would be in this case.,81,,
822,0.97,4201.83,4203.966,I hope I recall it correctly.,81,,
823,0.97,4203.966,4205.367,The director will correct me if I'm wrong.,81,,
824,0.97,4205.367,4225.988,"If bird bar place were to choose to expand for purposes of residential uses to housing, the easement would be that the housing is art to believe keep with the city's objectives to insure people have affordable places to live rooted in their communities.",81,,
825,0.97,4225.988,4232.695,The only thing is this is not a requirement.,82,,
826,0.97,4232.695,4234.697,It's just an option that is there.,82,,
827,0.97,4234.697,4240.536,Part of it so you know we constantly struggle finding places for affordable housing.,82,,
828,0.97,4240.536,4250.679,Is there any opportunities in the future and if the organizations like bird bar place are interested in what we're saying.,82,,
829,0.97,4250.679,4259.688,Let's put that option there in addition to the option to expand the existing services as well.,82,,
830,0.97,4259.688,4264.66,What would trigger a change or reversion is one of the questions.,82,,
831,0.97,4264.66,4276.238,If the entity and organization changes the mission and instead of service provision they choose to do something completely different.,82,,
832,0.97,4276.238,4281.043,Private enterprise or any other.,82,,
833,0.97,4281.043,4282.211,That would require reversion.,82,,
834,0.97,4282.211,4283.312,Specific to the easement.,82,,
835,0.97,4283.312,4296.859,It's adding that flexibility an option for affordable housing.,82,,
836,0.97,4296.859,4299.061,"Director, you Referenced a reversion.",82,,
837,0.97,4299.061,4305.868,"If they decided to change their mission, what would that look like?",82,,
838,0.97,4305.868,4312.274,What would the terms of that agreement require in that case?,82,,
839,0.97,4312.274,4323.952,"That would be best answered by the lawyers, in order to provide to meet the city, the state requirement of Gifting of public funds.",82,,
840,0.97,4323.952,4336.699,You have to have a public service that the city considers are value.,82,,
841,0.97,4336.699,4341.637,Provided now is a public service.,82,,
842,0.97,4341.637,4342.838,That is consistent with that requirement.,82,,
843,0.97,4342.838,4352.381,"If that changes in any significant way to do something other, private enterprise, then that would trigger the reversion.",82,,
844,0.97,4352.381,4363.192,That does not meet the environments to provide the public services as defined in the agreement.,82,,
845,0.97,4363.192,4379.141,But the decision to provide to build housing would not be considered something to trigger that reversion.,83,,
846,0.97,4379.141,4388.717,"As long as the housing is Artable up to 80% area median income, it does not.",84,,
847,0.97,4388.717,4401.43,"Also the combination of services on the ground floor, housing above, as long as it is affordable.",85,,
848,0.97,4401.43,4404.8,"Council member Strauss, I want to give Andrea a second.",85,,
849,0.97,4404.8,4412.274,Do you have comments or concerns about that element of the contract you want to flag for us?,85,,
850,0.97,4412.274,4412.574,I don't.,85,,
851,0.97,4412.574,4418.647,"I will say quite frankly, we had differences in opinions about that language being there.",85,,
852,0.97,4418.647,4425.154,We feel absolute we'll be around another 56 years and provided the same services well into the future.,85,,
853,0.97,4425.154,4432.194,Thank you for flagging that vice chair Herbold.,86,,
854,0.97,4432.194,4433.829,"Council member Strauss, please go ahead.",86,,
855,0.97,4433.829,4434.196,Thank you.,87,,
856,0.97,4434.196,4441.937,"I wanted to share my thanks to deputy Mayor, directors.",87,,
857,0.97,4441.937,4445.607,We spoke about this earlier this week.,87,,
858,0.97,4445.607,4448.277,Many thanks to you Andrea.,87,,
859,0.97,4448.277,4451.313,This work is incredible.,87,,
860,0.97,4451.313,4455.083,This is a great historic change.,87,,
861,0.97,4455.083,4458.554,Thank you all for your great work.,87,,
862,0.97,4458.554,4459.555,Thank you very much.,88,,
863,0.97,4459.555,4464.426,We also have Council member Lewis here as an Attendee.,88,,
864,0.97,4464.426,4472.0,I'll welcome comments from you Council member Lewis.,88,,
865,0.97,4472.0,4474.47,I think it's said by committee members.,89,,
866,0.97,4474.47,4488.283,This is at the foundation of how we do placement in community building in the city and just a great example of what we need a lot more of in our urban planning and investment.,89,,
867,0.97,4488.283,4489.284,Super excited about this today.,89,,
868,0.97,4489.284,4493.422,Thank you very much Council member Lewis.,90,,
869,0.97,4493.422,4504.967,"I have a question about the pros and Cons or benefits, discussion that may have gone into an outright transfer into a long term loose.",90,,
870,0.97,4504.967,4510.072,There's situations cities have used 99 year leases instead of outright transfer.,90,,
871,0.97,4510.072,4529.124,I think from the little that I know about housing development and getting future loans for improving existing structures to the Lende a 99 year lease doesn't make a difference whether it's long term or outright transfer.,90,,
872,0.97,4529.124,4533.929,"Andrea, you're welcome to Chime in on this in terms of your preferences.",90,,
873,0.97,4533.929,4551.079,Wondering what is the background behind whether or not we had considered a long term lease such as 99 year versus direct transfer.,90,,
874,0.97,4551.079,4560.789,Can you post comment on that.,90,,
875,0.97,4560.789,4566.628,It was about--.,90,,
876,0.97,4566.628,4572.301,For the record.,90,,
877,0.97,4572.301,4575.237,I didn't discuss the value in either one of those.,90,,
878,0.97,4575.237,4587.149,We started down the path of the long term lease.,90,,
879,0.97,4587.149,4596.425,We realized in our campaign feasibility study a lot of foundations and Funders were not keen to that.,90,,
880,0.97,4596.425,4604.266,Our private partners funding this project were okay with that.,90,,
881,0.97,4604.266,4607.369,A lot of private foundations were not.,90,,
882,0.97,4607.369,4609.271,We discussed with city staff over time.,90,,
883,0.97,4609.271,4618.38,The pros and cons of not just city but the community.,90,,
884,0.97,4618.38,4624.853,Eventually bird bar place felt strong.,90,,
885,0.97,4624.853,4630.759,Given the idea and philosophy and agency.,90,,
886,0.97,4630.759,4648.21,Private sources to renovate the building that owning the building out right was for us.,90,,
887,0.97,4648.21,4650.412,Thank you very much.,90,,
888,0.97,4650.412,4652.28,Please go ahead.,91,,
889,0.97,4652.28,4661.223,The ownership versus the 99 years lease is something.,92,,
890,0.97,4661.223,4668.363,Given a range of factors including the organizational capacity to take on commitments.,92,,
891,0.97,4668.363,4680.509,I'll talk about the issue of ownership as it is core to building community wealth and priority with what we talked about not just in this process.,92,,
892,0.97,4680.509,4695.39,The director and his program which is ownership of asset which allows you to leverage other types.,92,,
893,0.97,4695.39,4709.237,This is a component of how we thought about.,92,,
894,0.97,4709.237,4720.415,It's very clear and open with organizations understanding how ready are they in Terps of capacity to maintain building or these types of activities.,92,,
895,0.97,4720.415,4722.35,"Director, you want to add to that?",92,,
896,0.97,4722.35,4724.086,Only two things I'll add.,92,,
897,0.97,4724.086,4737.499,One is I mentioned about three or four years ago the community organizations came to us and asked for a transfer process.,92,,
898,0.97,4737.499,4739.734,Whether it's five stations or six.,92,,
899,0.97,4739.734,4743.939,At the time the city did not have a consistent process.,92,,
900,0.97,4743.939,4747.075,The transfer was the core ask.,92,,
901,0.97,4747.075,4755.15,We started engaging the community organizations as well as consultants to help us shape consistent process.,92,,
902,0.97,4755.15,4767.295,"The second part, for example on the Edi funding, bird bar received capital improvement.",92,,
903,0.97,4767.295,4778.24,They cannot spend it on the city owned at the see they're waiting get that release more the Edi Fund.,92,,
904,0.97,4778.24,4782.544,"If it's transferred, they're able to utilize that.",92,,
905,0.97,4782.544,4785.68,That's one consideration for bird bar place.,92,,
906,0.97,4785.68,4791.753,Then the bigger emphasis is what Andre said.,92,,
907,0.97,4791.753,4793.655,There's no better wealth building than ownership.,92,,
908,0.97,4793.655,4798.827,You're still actually not an owner of a property.,92,,
909,0.97,4798.827,4806.935,Especially property as we learn more about the causes of poverty for populations.,92,,
910,0.97,4806.935,4814.943,Ownership is a critical element of that whether psychologically and practically as well.,92,,
911,0.97,4814.943,4816.278,Thank you all very much.,93,,
912,0.97,4816.278,4825.72,Are there additional comments or questions on this agenda item?,93,,
913,0.97,4825.72,4826.221,Anything else to add?,93,,
914,0.97,4826.221,4826.388,No.,93,,
915,0.97,4826.388,4826.688,Thank you.,93,,
916,0.97,4826.688,4827.589,Okay.,94,,
917,0.97,4827.589,4828.423,I'm not seeing additional hands.,94,,
918,0.97,4828.423,4833.528,"Andrea, any final comments or feel you got all your comments in?",94,,
919,0.97,4833.528,4833.728,I do.,94,,
920,0.97,4833.728,4834.763,Thank you for the space.,94,,

978,0.97,5063.625,5067.729,We heard a lot about that in public testimony today.,108,,
979,0.97,5067.729,5086.147,"Before we ask central staff to walk through, I wanted to say to director John and your team at office of labor standards how much we appreciate all of you and your entire team including Sarah Lair who was a dear friend of many of us on Council.",108,,
980,0.97,5086.147,5093.388,I had the opportunity to work closely with her on farm and labor standard issues the last decade or so.,108,,
981,0.97,5093.388,5096.925,Her incredible work is a true legacy that stands on its own.,108,,
982,0.97,5096.925,5103.364,She was a pillar of good work at the office of labor standards does.,108,,

985,0.97,5108.136,5117.178,"We'll continue to uplift all she fought for, especially immigrants and refugees and vulnerable worker across our State and especially here in our city.",108,,
986,0.97,5117.178,5120.381,We thank the office of labor standards for your good work.,108,,

990,0.97,5137.765,5140.301,Tell us more about the bill in front of us today.,108,,
991,0.97,5140.301,5149.511,We'll have an opportunity to hear from office of labor standards and her Council colleagues.,108,,
992,0.97,5149.511,5150.078,Hi.,109,,
993,0.97,5150.078,5157.886,"As you noted, this bill is establishing a minimum compensation standard for TNC drivers along with other protections.",109,,
994,0.97,5157.886,5162.123,I don't have a full presentation prepared for today.,109,,
995,0.97,5162.123,5171.099,Office of labor standards has generously offered to share their presentation that they've already shared Wih the Council and members of the public for this Committee.,109,,
996,0.97,5171.099,5184.512,I will turn it over to Karen now to provide that information.,109,,
997,0.97,5184.512,5186.481,Thanks.,110,,
998,0.97,5186.481,5193.955,I'll load the power point up here.,110,,
999,0.97,5193.955,5195.757,Can everyone see that all right?,110,,
1000,0.97,5195.757,5195.99,Great.,110,,
1001,0.97,5195.99,5203.398,So I was asked to sort of give a quick overview of what's contained in the legislation.,110,,
1002,0.97,5203.398,5205.199,We provide a similar presentation last month.,110,,
1003,0.97,5205.199,5214.342,I'll try to keep it brief but happy to go into more detail that Councilmembers would like at any point.,110,,
1004,0.97,5214.342,5221.683,The first thing I want to level set for everyone is for folks that have seen this numerous times now.,110,,
1005,0.97,5221.683,5231.025,It's important because I'll use some of these terms today.,110,,
1006,0.97,5231.025,5232.594,Driver time is divided into three phases.,110,,
1007,0.97,5232.594,5244.105,There's P 1 available platform when a driver is waiting to get a trip request.,110,,
1008,0.97,5244.105,5247.909,A driver receive aid trip request and it's passenger location.,110,,
1009,0.97,5247.909,5253.715,Finally P 3 when the driver is driving the passenger to their destination.,110,,
1010,0.97,5253.715,5258.019,These terms will be in the legislation itself and I'll be referring to them today.,110,,
1011,0.97,5258.019,5273.735,One point on this is it's important to remember that a driver cannot be in P 3 doing the part of the work we as members of the community and passengers without being in P 1 and P 2.,110,,
1012,0.97,5273.735,5281.809,Further more the companies rely on drivers being in P 1 in order to deliver their service to passengers.,110,,
1013,0.97,5281.809,5301.562,"They have low wait times which requires drivers in P 1. we thought it was critical to insure drivers are paid for all of their time when they were waiting for a passenger, driving to the passenger location finally when they're driving the passenger.",110,,
1014,0.97,5301.562,5310.004,"So with that sort of stage set, let's drive into the ordinance itself.",110,,
1015,0.97,5310.004,5311.973,It covers TNC drivers in Seattle.,110,,
1016,0.97,5311.973,5313.374,There's a little knew answer there.,110,,
1017,0.97,5313.374,5322.483,"If a ride begins in Seattle and ends outside of Seattle, the entire ride will be covered by the ordinance.",110,,
1018,0.97,5322.483,5338.166,"If the ride begins outside of Seattle and comes into Seattle, only the portion of the ride that is within the city boundary will be required to be paid at the minimum compensation level.",110,,
1019,0.97,5338.166,5354.515,"For Tncs themselves, any TNC that provides services in seat and will reports more than 200,000 rides in the prior quarter will be covered by the ordinance and transferred.",110,,
1020,0.97,5354.515,5361.856,"The pay policy itself is divided into two components, a time component and a mileage component.",110,,
1021,0.97,5361.856,5365.259,There's a permanent rate and per mile rate.,110,,
1022,0.97,5365.259,5375.103,Those are designed to address two different buckets of compensation.,110,,
1023,0.97,5375.103,5387.381,"The first one, time is compensation for Seattle's minimum wage at 16.39 currently.",110,,
1024,0.97,5387.381,5406.134,"The mileage component is designed to compensate for the reasonable expenses drivers incur which is both the cost of just driving a car around to cost of vehicle, gas, maintenance, those types of things as well as what we call Nonmileage expenses.",110,,
1025,0.97,5406.134,5413.775,These are benefits or costs that many employees have compensation for.,110,,
1026,0.97,5413.775,5426.087,Health insurance and employer payroll taxes are examples as well as other taxes and licensing fees Úthat drivers must incur.,110,,
1027,0.97,5426.087,5426.687,Those are the two components.,110,,
1028,0.97,5426.687,5430.625,Let's talk about what they mean in terms of numbers.,110,,
1029,0.97,5430.625,5439.2,I mentioned time component of minimum wage 16.39 made into a permanent amount.,110,,
1030,0.97,5439.2,5440.401,That's 56-Cents.,110,,
1031,0.97,5440.401,5441.202,The mileage is $1.17.,110,,
1032,0.97,5441.202,5442.603,There's complexity here.,110,,
1033,0.97,5442.603,5450.711,"If you take $16.39 and divide by 60, it equals 27-Cents.",110,,
1034,0.97,5450.711,5466.694,"Because the pay standard only attaches to the time spent in P 3 when a driver has a passenger, we have increased the 27-Cent amount to cover all of their working time P 1 and P 2. the factor of increase is roughly 2X.",110,,
1035,0.97,5466.694,5470.131,They spend half the time with a passenger in the car.,110,,
1036,0.97,5470.131,5479.507,We increase to make sure they're paid for all their time.,110,,
1037,0.97,5479.507,5481.042,Same principle for mileage.,110,,
1038,0.97,5481.042,5485.947,The factor of increase is different.,110,,
1039,0.97,5485.947,5488.149,The same idea is present there as well.,110,,
1040,0.97,5488.149,5491.352,That's the core of how the pay policy works.,110,,
1041,0.97,5491.352,5497.258,We have a number of other protections in there to insure this functions well.,110,,
1042,0.97,5497.258,5498.226,I highlighted them here.,110,,
1043,0.97,5498.226,5515.176,We have tip protection so that any tip paid by the passenger needs to go to the driver.,110,,
1044,0.97,5515.176,5516.177,They cannot use tips.,110,,
1045,0.97,5516.177,5520.982,Cancellation fees charged to a passenger goes to the driver.,110,,
1046,0.97,5520.982,5535.463,"We also have transparency provisions, such that both drivers and passengers received detailed ride receipts and that drivers get pay statements every time they are paid detailing what trips they did and what they were paid.",110,,
1047,0.97,5535.463,5545.439,"We have a standard Recordkeeping provision of three years and proposed effective date of January 1st, 2021.",110,,
1048,0.97,5545.439,5549.01,I'm not going to go over the next two in detail.,110,,
1049,0.97,5549.01,5551.312,They're here in case there are questions.,110,,
1050,0.97,5551.312,5552.346,We can circle back.,110,,
1051,0.97,5552.346,5556.584,We modeled a number of trips and what drivers make now.,110,,
1052,0.97,5556.584,5565.626,"You can see those listed here, downtown to Capitol Hill, airport trips, enter downtown and U district.",110,,
1053,0.97,5565.626,5574.602,We compare the current pay with what they should make under the pay standard to give us a real world example of that.,110,,
1054,0.97,5574.602,5586.247,The final slide here just models what driver average pay was prior to the Covid.,110,,
1055,0.97,5586.247,5588.783,We did our evaluation before Covid.,110,,
1056,0.97,5588.783,5592.386,Average pay was under the pay policy.,110,,
1057,0.97,5592.386,5598.759,It should go up to about a 30% increase.,110,,
1058,0.97,5598.759,5603.831,84% of drivers receive 9 some sort of increase.,110,,
1059,0.97,5603.831,5609.87,So I know that was quite a lot and quickly.,110,,
1060,0.97,5609.87,5621.782,I wanted to move through quickly and open for any questions or anything helpful to go into the greater detail.,110,,
1061,0.97,5621.782,5621.983,Okay.,110,,
1062,0.97,5621.983,5622.283,Wonderful.,110,,
1063,0.97,5622.283,5629.29,Thank you all for your work and the presentation today.,110,,
1064,0.97,5629.29,5633.761,Is there anything else Korena and Amy you'd like to share?,110,,
1065,0.97,5633.761,5640.134,I'll just add the legislation is comprehensive and has a number of additional standards and requirements.,110,,
1066,0.97,5640.134,5652.279,Just a couple that I'll lift up is that every year there are a number of automatic ADJUSTS and some discretionary adjustments to figures and Ordnance.,110,,
1067,0.97,5652.279,5662.823,"For example, the permanent amount that is tied to the minimum wage of course will increase automatically to align with Seattle's minimum wage.",110,,
1068,0.97,5662.823,5670.231,There's a per mile rate that is scaled up as using the term.,110,,
1069,0.97,5670.231,5671.065,It's a utilization rate.,110,,
1070,0.97,5671.065,5672.633,It means the same thing.,110,,
1071,0.97,5672.633,5679.907,That per mile rate can be adjusted by the director and discretionary basis.,110,,
1072,0.97,5679.907,5688.816,"If it's not adjusted on a discretionary basis, it will increase automatically to reflect the rate on inflation.",110,,
1073,0.97,5688.816,5694.555,There's also a discretionary decision for the director to increase the scale up factor as well.,110,,
1074,0.97,5694.555,5700.528,Of course penalties and fines will be increased to represent rate of inflation as well.,110,,
1075,0.97,5700.528,5715.576,The next piece is that the legislation provides for provision of personal protective equipment and Disinfecting supplies.,110,,
1076,0.97,5715.576,5723.451,That's in addition to modest allowance for cleaning already in reasonable expenses per mile rate as well.,110,,
1077,0.97,5723.451,5723.784,Wonderful.,111,,
1078,0.97,5723.784,5724.585,Thank you all very much.,111,,
1079,0.97,5724.585,5740.835,Any additional comments or questions at this point.,112,,
1080,0.97,5742.269,5742.436,Sorry.,112,,
1081,0.97,5742.436,5749.31,I'm trying to manage too many screens here.,112,,
1082,0.97,5749.31,5761.088,I'd like to hear from you about what you envision as our committee process moving forward on deliberations on this bill.,112,,
1083,0.97,5761.088,5761.756,Wonder.,113,,
1084,0.97,5761.756,5762.423,Thank you for that.,113,,
1085,0.97,5762.423,5774.935,"As it Ares to the next steps, we are hoping that we are able to get any Decisionle comments and questions, any amendment ideas from folks.",114,,
1086,0.97,5774.935,5781.142,Remind me of the deadline we were hoping for later this week I believe.,114,,
1087,0.97,5781.142,5786.947,I don't think we've established a deadline for amendments.,115,,
1088,0.97,5786.947,5792.653,Thinking the next committee meeting will be next Thursday.,115,,
1089,0.97,5792.653,5798.058,I would say maybe Thursday midday.,115,,
1090,0.97,5798.058,5798.325,Great.,116,,
1091,0.97,5798.325,5798.726,Thursday midday.,116,,
1092,0.97,5798.726,5811.138,"The following week, they could be Teed up for discussion and in consideration.",116,,
1093,0.97,5811.138,5822.55,"I will NOTE there's conversations we'll have after talking with folks from the Association, Lyft, teamsters.",117,,
1094,0.97,5822.55,5834.295,I'm looking willing forward to bringing forward Emits still being Crafted.,117,,
1095,0.97,5834.295,5838.065,There could be a substitute to look at like a whole package.,117,,
1096,0.97,5838.065,5848.576,Just so you could see the full picture of how pieces swear change together.,117,,
1097,0.97,5848.576,5849.009,This is helpful.,118,,
1098,0.97,5849.009,5859.019,We mean substitute bill or are you saying there's going to be one amendment that is like all the proposed amendments?,118,,
1099,0.97,5859.019,5863.691,It would basically be a roll up of various amendments I'm hearing about.,118,,
1100,0.97,5863.691,5871.532,"It would be a list of amendments that would in effect, tell me if I'm saying this wrong be a substitute to our existing bill.",118,,
1101,0.97,5871.532,5875.836,You would see all the amendments in one place.,118,,
1102,0.97,5875.836,5876.136,Got it.,119,,
1103,0.97,5876.136,5887.047,"That substitute, would it--do you envision it needing a title change?",120,,
1104,0.97,5887.047,5887.214,No.,120,,
1105,0.97,5887.214,5892.052,There's additional issues that both folks from Community partners have raised and Council members have raised.,120,,
1106,0.97,5892.052,5897.224,I encourage us to try to leave the title as is.,120,,
1107,0.97,5897.224,5902.396,"If there's a corresponding piece of legislation someone would like to offer that compliment this is, that would be welcome.",120,,
1108,0.97,5902.396,5906.567,"At this point, I don't think we would want to Redraft the bill.",120,,
1109,0.97,5906.567,5910.371,We would want to work in the confines of the title.,120,,
1110,0.97,5910.371,5917.177,"If there's additional pieces people think would fit nicely, I would welcome that conversation.",120,,
1111,0.97,5917.177,5919.246,Thank you.,121,,
1112,0.97,5919.246,5922.917,Any additional comments or questions?,122,,
1113,0.97,5922.917,5924.885,I'll make a few comments.,122,,
1114,0.97,5924.885,5925.786,Please go ahead Councilmember Strauss.,122,,
1115,0.97,5925.786,5929.423,I think this is an important piece of legislation.,123,,
1116,0.97,5929.423,5934.828,We need to maintain our minimum wage held across all platforms.,123,,
1117,0.97,5934.828,5948.809,This bill is also as I heard bringing forward important Transparencies so the driver understands what the passenger is paying and how all costs are accumulated throughout this type of business.,123,,
1118,0.97,5948.809,5950.311,Thank you for hosting this Committee.,123,,
1119,0.97,5950.311,5955.683,I look forward to the process as it continues.,123,,
1120,0.97,5955.683,5958.919,Thank you very much Councilmember Strauss.,124,,
1121,0.97,5958.919,5960.287,Not seeing additional comments.,125,,
1122,0.97,5960.287,5963.357,I'll offer a few comments to the public.,125,,
1123,0.97,5963.357,5971.598,"If it seems like we talk about you Canner and Lyft and other ride share companies for a long time, that is true.",125,,
1124,0.97,5971.598,5979.073,"We talk about these because as Councilmember Herbold discussed, the gig economy is not a Slither of the economy.",125,,
1125,0.97,5979.073,5980.24,It is the economy.,125,,
1126,0.97,5980.24,5997.858,"We think about ways Seattle can really apply our labor standards to Nontraditional work in sectors where we've seen gig work continue to grow and expand, wanting to make sure the strong labor standards and principals we have for protecting workers is critical.",125,,
1127,0.97,5997.858,6001.495,"Yes, it does seem we can continue to talk about this issue.",125,,
1128,0.97,6001.495,6004.198,I described this on Monday during Council briefing.,125,,
1129,0.97,6004.198,6026.387,This is another element to the conversations we had last year and other strategies that we advanced earlier this year to make sure folks working in gig type work have true protections so they can--as one of the spoke people said today during public Testimonies they can put food on the table and keep a roof over their head.,125,,
1130,0.97,6026.387,6038.065,"Around the corner from where I live, I often see mini cars that look like black car drivers, the nice Lincolns that are sitting there.",125,,
1131,0.97,6038.065,6039.299,I believe people are living in them.,125,,
1132,0.97,6039.299,6047.107,It's imperative to make sure people putting their life's work into providing a service at least have a minimum wage.,125,,
1133,0.97,6047.107,6051.378,That's part of what this effort is trying to do.,125,,
1134,0.97,6051.378,6057.518,"Just for background in 2014, the city began regulating TNC by requiring licensing.",125,,
1135,0.97,6057.518,6067.261,"Since then the city council discussed and passed a number of policies Includig those requiring data disclosure, protecting the rights of workers and more.",125,,
1136,0.97,6067.261,6071.165,These policies were met with fierce lobbying and litigation and did not stick.,125,,
1137,0.97,6071.165,6085.546,Last fall the city passed a series of legislation requiring a process for drivers deactivation so that drivers that spend their life savings on a car and experience can't be deactivated without at least a process.,125,,
1138,0.97,6085.546,6091.852,We also passed a resolution to study adequate base wages for drivers.,125,,
1139,0.97,6091.852,6100.761,"This year under the leadership, we have a study as well as legislative proposals for base wages here.",125,,
1140,0.97,6100.761,6104.598,Many of you received a briefing about this legislation.,125,,
1141,0.97,6104.598,6107.668,I appreciate your time there.,125,,
1142,0.97,6107.668,6119.546,"Since a few of us were not there for a--since a few of us had additional few weeks between those conversations and today, I think this Recap has been extremely helpful.",125,,
1143,0.97,6119.546,6125.786,I do want to make sure that folks have plenty of time to review any amendments.,125,,
1144,0.97,6125.786,6129.289,"Any amendments we receive, we'll make sure and send those out.",125,,
1145,0.97,6129.289,6135.362,"The amendments I'm considering drafting, we'll make sure folks get that well in advance of our kept 24th meeting.",125,,
1146,0.97,6135.362,6138.899,We hope to vote on a revised bill.,125,,
1147,0.97,6138.899,6144.204,"If there are additional amendments, we'll reconcile those and make sure to share it as early as possible.",125,,
1148,0.97,6144.204,6159.386,"My hope is that we will be able to continue to solicit not just your feedback but from Uber, Lyft, teamsters, drive guard as we have done in the past.",125,,
1149,0.97,6159.386,6167.361,Thanks again for all of the comments and questions that came today.,125,,
1150,0.97,6167.361,6171.298,"Yes, continue to encourage comments and questions.",125,,
1151,0.97,6171.298,6171.798,Councilmember Herbold.,125,,
1152,0.97,6171.798,6172.065,Go ahead.,125,,
1153,0.97,6172.065,6172.866,I'm so sorry.,126,,
1154,0.97,6172.866,6174.468,I mentioned I was juggling screens.,126,,
1155,0.97,6174.468,6178.438,One of the screens was the notes for this meetings.,126,,
1156,0.97,6178.438,6191.952,I want to signal my interest in amendments to address a couple issues that I understand you chair Mosqueda have interests in.,126,,
1157,0.97,6191.952,6210.571,One of those is to strengthen the transparency requirements and the bill so that riders and drivers know how much each is paying and being paid.,126,,
1158,0.97,6210.571,6250.877,Then also we received an important letter regarding the health care and cleaning practices that are necessary during Covid-19 from an academic who has been really focused on that issue across the work being done by essential workers and very interested in addressing that issue compensating people for the costs associated with maintaining their vehicles in accordance with practices including the time.,126,,
1159,0.97,6250.877,6264.124,This is something that Council member Lewis and I worked on as it related to premium pay or food delivery drivers.,126,,
1160,0.97,6264.124,6274.167,I'm interested in addressing that as it relates to TNC drivers as well as in this legislation moving forward.,126,,
1161,0.97,6274.167,6289.583,"I absolutely support efforts and look forward to making sure we get amendment language that comes out so it reflects your priorities as well before everything is finalized on Thursday, September 24th.",127,,
1162,0.97,6289.583,6301.161,"We will be looking at additional language related to issues around transparency and pricing mechanisms, adding in labor standards that many other workers received and providing stable wages for drivers.",127,,
1163,0.97,6301.161,6317.778,I think all of that is complimentary to the existing base legislation in front of us and look forward to working with you Council and vice chair Herbold and any other members looking to bring principles forward to streamline our conversation again.,127,,
1164,0.97,6317.778,6325.185,Thyme going to try to see how many we can merge into one larger document.,127,,
1165,0.97,6325.185,6326.92,We'll welcome at that discussion.,127,,
1166,0.97,6326.92,6331.825,I do have one quick question before we wrap up today's discussion.,127,,
1167,0.97,6331.825,6335.696,"For office of labor standards, I think this will be a question for you.",127,,
1168,0.97,6335.696,6348.208,One thing we heard from the TNC operators that the wage formula transmitted looks similar to the New York model and limited the number of drivers on the App.,127,,
1169,0.97,6348.208,6358.919,I assume this means the drivers on the App were getting more hours and some were less likely to be forced to have a second or third job.,127,,
1170,0.97,6358.919,6368.295,Can you walk us through how the legislation addresses that concern around P 1 time and number of drivers on the App?,127,,
1171,0.97,6368.295,6368.495,Yeah.,127,,
1172,0.97,6368.495,6369.629,Thank you for the question.,127,,
1173,0.97,6369.629,6375.635,I think it's healthy to dive into that.,127,,
1174,0.97,6375.635,6381.541,"There's quite a bit there the way the New York policy works, you're correct.",127,,
1175,0.97,6381.541,6386.847,It aims to keep drivers busier so to speak and increase their pay.,127,,
1176,0.97,6386.847,6399.96,I want to draw a distinction between different policy reasons there would be a reduction in drivers on the platform.,127,,
1177,0.97,6399.96,6402.896,One is what we heard from the company.,127,,
1178,0.97,6402.896,6416.843,Sent a letter to Council that there's a New York policy of monitoring how busy drivers are and that resulted.,127,,
1179,0.97,6416.843,6417.244,That's one area.,127,,
1180,0.97,6417.244,6434.795,The other kind of area of arguments is similar to stuff we've heard before the Seattle passed the minimum wage Ordnance that increasing wages for compensation results in reduction of employment and number of workers.,127,,
1181,0.97,6434.795,6439.633,Those arguments were made by in large haven't been born out.,127,,
1182,0.97,6439.633,6450.41,We had record low unemployment in Seattle before Covid.,127,,
1183,0.97,6450.41,6467.694,I think this values setting a minimum quarantine so nobody falls below that in contrast to maximizing employment at the expansive race to the bottom in terms of wages.,127,,
1184,0.97,6467.694,6474.434,What policy does is create a guarantee of living wage.,127,,
1185,0.97,6474.434,6478.038,84% of drivers continue receive that now.,127,,
1186,0.97,6478.038,6480.74,It sets a minimum per minute rate.,127,,
1187,0.97,6480.74,6513.506,It does not require monitoring of how busy drivers are any policy choice by the companies to reduce the number of drivers on the platform would be tied more to that second bucket of argument they have chosen as a way of implementing to reduce the number of workers than to say other policy choices like reducing commissions to address that.,127,,
1188,0.97,6513.506,6516.977,I want to say distinctions between seat and will New York.,127,,
1189,0.97,6516.977,6526.887,"In the regulatory bucket, they have a cap on the number of vehicles that can be licensed at all.",127,,
1190,0.97,6526.887,6540.7,"They had a really rapid influx of new drivers resulting in 3000 drivers per month and total of 200,000 prior to their policy being implemented.",127,,
1191,0.97,6540.7,6547.707,Seattle policy does not require a monitoring of how busy drivers are for over a year or perhaps longer.,127,,
1192,0.97,6547.707,6551.978,It requires we provide to the company before we do anything of that nature.,127,,
1193,0.97,6551.978,6562.122,There's no reason for the companies to limit the number of drivers based on how busy drivers are.,127,,
1194,0.97,6562.122,6568.228,At the beginning of this policy.,127,,
1195,0.97,6568.228,6570.263,I hope that answers the question.,127,,
1196,0.97,6570.263,6570.697,That's helpful.,128,,
1197,0.97,6570.697,6580.04,"If you have follow up on the New York example we might be able to share with other Council colleagues, that would be helpful if they're not able to listen in on this presentation.",128,,
1198,0.97,6580.04,6587.414,We'll share with them the power point presentation you shared so that everybody has the same information.,128,,
1199,0.97,6587.414,6589.115,Really appreciate that background and information.,128,,
1200,0.97,6589.115,6590.75,"Vice chair, go ahead.",128,,
1201,0.97,6590.75,6592.586,One other question.,129,,
1202,0.97,6592.586,6609.369,An issue that has been raised with my office relates to regulations related to the condition of vehicles.,129,,
1203,0.97,6609.369,6627.253,Can anybody from Los or Korena speak to how the legislation has proposed addresses that issue minimum standards for vehicle conditions or vehicle age I think is one of the issues?,129,,
1204,0.97,6627.253,6627.454,Yeah.,129,,
1205,0.97,6627.454,6629.956,The Ordnance does not address it.,129,,
1206,0.97,6629.956,6638.198,I think that is sort of outside expertise.,129,,
1207,0.97,6638.198,6639.032,That properly falls more within FAS.,129,,
1208,0.97,6639.032,6643.636,Maybe there's a way for the Ordnance to address it.,129,,
1209,0.97,6643.636,6644.17,Fas administering it.,129,,
1210,0.97,6644.17,6645.305,That's a possibility.,129,,
1211,0.97,6645.305,6654.514,The short answer is that the Ordnance does not contain regulation of vehicle age.,129,,
1212,0.97,6654.514,6654.814,Thank you.,129,,
1213,0.97,6654.814,6656.282,Yeah so I agree.,130,,
1214,0.97,6656.282,6661.021,The legislation doesn't regulate what age the vehicle needs to be.,130,,
1215,0.97,6661.021,6667.994,"I'll add that in the calculation of the reasonable expenses, researchers were able.",130,,
1216,0.97,6667.994,6679.873,They calculated an amount that is based on 48 month loan for a vehicle and they're assuming the average life span of a vehicle is four years.,130,,
1217,0.97,6679.873,6690.383,So correct me if I'm wrong but their calculation of the per mile cost for reasonable expenses includes a purchase or loan of a new car every four years.,130,,
1218,0.97,6690.383,6697.424,Is that one way to think about it?,130,,
1219,0.97,6697.424,6697.991,That's right.,130,,
1220,0.97,6697.991,6705.365,They did assume how long a vehicle is on the platform.,130,,
1221,0.97,6705.365,6706.166,I'm understanding the question.,130,,
1222,0.97,6706.166,6716.476,I've always heard concerns from drivers there's a cutoff they're no longer to allowed to drive a vehicle.,130,,
1223,0.97,6716.476,6721.781,If they've invested the same amount of money and purchased when two years old.,130,,
1224,0.97,6721.781,6723.049,They're forced.,130,,
1225,0.97,6723.049,6727.087,That issue is not addressed in the Ordnance.,130,,
1226,0.97,6727.087,6744.17,"Yes, there's an average length Uber drivers to have a vehicle after which the vehicle cannot--doesn't have residual value and his car isn't reliable enough to drive.",130,,
1227,0.97,6744.17,6744.537,Thank you.,131,,
1228,0.97,6744.537,6748.541,Thank you for raising that Council member.,132,,
1229,0.97,6748.541,6749.743,This Ising and I'm interested in as well.,132,,
1230,0.97,6749.743,6753.98,"As you continue to look at that issue, please keep me updated.",132,,
1231,0.97,6753.98,6757.217,I know this is a real issue as I mentioned.,132,,
1232,0.97,6757.217,6767.727,Uber black cars appear to be around the corner with folks not having the about to keep the roof over their head is problematic.,132,,
1233,0.97,6767.727,6771.798,They're not able to pay for a house or food on the table.,132,,
1234,0.97,6771.798,6784.444,We want to make sure we're not creating--we want to make sure there's about to keep their car and their house and food.,132,,
1235,0.97,6784.444,6787.447,"Councilmembers, additional comments or questions.",132,,
1236,0.97,6787.447,6809.836,"One question related to the study I heard last week from Lyft, their study do we know if Lyft provided drivers or data to the city or researchers to incorporate?",132,,
1237,0.97,6809.836,6818.144,The short answer is no.,132,,
1238,0.97,6818.144,6818.711,They did not provide data.,132,,
1239,0.97,6818.711,6833.726,"Before launching it's study engaged the companies asked for data, how long each trip is and what the pay was.",132,,
1240,0.97,6833.726,6842.869,"The company's decline, stating privacy concerns.",132,,
1241,0.97,6842.869,6844.637,It did give us data.,132,,
1242,0.97,6844.637,6844.904,Uber did.,132,,
1243,0.97,6844.904,6882.709,Then they provided that trip level data to Cornell.,132,,
1244,0.97,6882.709,6884.277,We were made aware of the study roughly two weeks before it was released.,132,,
1245,0.97,6884.277,6885.345,"It was released the same day, roughly as our study.",132,,
1246,0.97,6885.345,6887.313,"Because of our time line, we could not directly incorporate that analysis into our study.",132,,
