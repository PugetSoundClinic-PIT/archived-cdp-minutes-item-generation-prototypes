The questions I have for Council, why is this such an unpopular issue?",7,,
74,0.97,551.384,565.565,"If it is so popular we can fund research and we can fund acute clinics but not actual housing, there is never housing for that . Why is this so politically unfavorable?",7,,

86,0.97,629.462,637.136,The Mayor's budget doesn't allocate any new funding for expanding new services and I'm asking you to consider that today in your budget package.,13,,

165,0.97,1173.772,1179.912,At this time let's move into the first item on the agenda.,21,,
166,0.97,1179.912,1182.014,"Madam clerk, please read item 1 into the record.",21,,
167,0.97,1182.014,1186.285,"Agenda item 1, office of planning and punitive community development for briefing and discussion.",22,,
168,0.97,1186.285,1195.894,It is great to see you and I want to welcome you to city council presentation.,23,,
169,0.97,1195.894,1196.929,Issue identification day two.,23,,
170,0.97,1196.929,1198.363,Thanks for heading up the discussion today.,23,,
171,0.97,1198.363,1204.736,I think some folks have had the chance to read your memo already in addition to the slides.,23,,
172,0.97,1204.736,1225.424,I want to say how important this policy development memo is and making sure that folks really get a chance to read some of the incredible work that was put into this . I'm going to lift up some folks as we go along especially at the top of page 3 for context setting in that memo where it says according to the U.S.,23,,
173,0.97,1225.424,1239.238,"Census, Seattle was the third fastest growing large city in the United States between 2010 and 2020, growing by 128,000 residents from just over 600,000 to now almost 740.",23,,
174,0.97,1239.238,1250.349,"That is a 21% increase . in that period the number of housing units grew by about 60,000 units.",23,,
175,0.97,1250.349,1280.512,"That is about a 19% increase, nowhere near the number of units that we need to address the population in total and during this period the housing that Seattle households grew significantly wealthier with wealth inequality so we are looking forward to hearing more as you provide the context for why Opcd's work is so incredibly important given that the cost of housing went from around $400,000 in 2010 to now, over $850,000.",23,,
176,0.97,1280.512,1289.187,This is the context in which we receive the Opcd information and really appreciate your presentation here today.,23,,
177,0.97,1289.187,1296.228,Go ahead and get us started and we will turn it over to Council member Strauss for the first rounds of questions.,23,,
178,0.97,1296.228,1297.029,Good morning.,24,,
179,0.97,1297.029,1300.932,Can you move to the next slide?,24,,
180,0.97,1300.932,1310.742,So the office of planning and community development is in charge of citywide planning and community based investments in equitable developments.,24,,
181,0.97,1310.742,1331.763,"It has five divisions, equitable development, community planning,--and long use planning . with the injunction of payroll tax funding to support development projects and other changes, the budget increases increases from 122% to $31 million.",24,,
182,0.97,1331.763,1351.817,Staffing increases from 42 to 46 1/2 FTE or--. Three positions are added to support equitable development initiative or Edi grants . One indigenous planner position is added to manage the--Valley projects.,24,,
183,0.97,1351.817,1365.797,And a position is transferred to--center where we are doing most of their work with the Seattle center.,24,,
184,0.97,1365.797,1370.402,"In addition, there are three classifications of vacant positions to lower-level positions to better provide a range of skill sets.",24,,
185,0.97,1370.402,1407.139,"Initiatives in 2022 include the update, major update to the conference of plan, planning for regional growth centers, light rail stationary planning, the environmental impact Stadium for Maritime and industrial strategy, implementation of the--Valley program which includes $2.5 million for projects in--and South park and the equitable development initiative which will have $19.5 million for grants in 2022.",24,,
186,0.97,1407.139,1412.611,As mentioned on page 3 of the memo I discuss some of the growth trends in the city.,24,,
187,0.97,1412.611,1417.916,Opcd's planning work is occurring in the context of significant growth.,24,,
188,0.97,1417.916,1439.671,"Employment grew faster than the population growth . median income group sharply of the last 10 years and because income is not equitably distributed across races,--of--and before I get into the issues, let's stop and see if there are any questions.",24,,
189,0.97,1439.671,1460.292,Thank you so we have Council member Strauss who is the chair of Land-Use and we will see if Council member Strauss has any questions and then we have Council member Morales who has--before we get into--Council member Strauss other any comments or questions you would like to put out there at this moment?,25,,
190,0.97,1460.292,1476.875,"Good morning, chair Mosqueda, real briefly, I was wondering, and I know I may have asked several of these questions two weeks ago but can you help me understand about the funding for the COMP plan major update and EIS process?",26,,
191,0.97,1476.875,1481.813,How does the funding levels that we have in the transmitted budget compared to prior years?,26,,
192,0.97,1481.813,1493.191,So there is--there are two buckets of funding.,27,,
193,0.97,1493.191,1499.798,Our regional engagement and consultant support for the environmental impact statement which requires part of the plan update.,27,,
194,0.97,1499.798,1512.21,"Outreach and engagement received $100,000 in 2021 and was budgeted for another $50,000 next year.",27,,
195,0.97,1512.21,1536.868,"The environmental impact statement received $30,000 in 2021. the bulk of the funding is provided in 2022, $300,000 and $95,000 is planned for 2023, the total for 425,000 dollars.",27,,
196,0.97,1536.868,1558.39,"Looking at the last major update, $20 million EIS work was budgeted at $500,000 less than what was budgeted eight years ago.",27,,
197,0.97,1558.39,1564.362,And outreach and engagement was significantly higher at that time.,27,,
198,0.97,1564.362,1569.367,Another example is the mandatory housing Affordability work.,27,,
199,0.97,1569.367,1589.02,"That was done following the last COMP plan update and that EIS was budgeted at $750,000 and the outreach and engagement work for that citywide zoning effort was also $750,000.",27,,
200,0.97,1589.02,1590.689,Thank you.,28,,
201,0.97,1590.689,1591.723,That is very helpful.,28,,
202,0.97,1591.723,1600.832,And I know there are some efforts to make some changes to what had been transmitted.,28,,
203,0.97,1600.832,1609.708,"Staying on the COMP plan major update, topic, other other departments other than Opcd the need funding for this work?",28,,
204,0.97,1609.708,1647.345,"Much so thinking about where the city has been challenged on previous environmental impact statement work, clearly, historic preservation was a major issue with the mandatory housing Affordability EIS and that analysis, because it--so the city has a citywide survey of historic resources that citywide survey is not complete.",28,,
205,0.97,1647.345,1652.484,It doesn't address many of the areas with the highest risk of displacement.,28,,
206,0.97,1652.484,1670.001,"And updating that survey to support historic preservation analysis in EIS would cost about $125,000 and Department and neighborhoods would be the lead on that.",28,,
207,0.97,1670.001,1674.506,That is helpful and you Teed up my next question which is good you say more about the historic resources survey?,29,,
208,0.97,1674.506,1679.01,What are we surveying and how does it interact with the other plans we have going on?,29,,
209,0.97,1679.01,1679.678,Yes.,30,,
210,0.97,1679.678,1744.676,The historic resources survey is sort of a first cut look at the structures in the city . It is typically a wind chill survey where historic preservation service will go through neighborhoods and looking at because of their hr potentially eligible which is identifying some of the structures which is actually--likely eligible and allows the city to basically Prioritize their analysis on those structures that are most likely to actually have historic significance rather than requiring structures saved greater than 50 years old.,30,,
211,0.97,1744.676,1747.779,"Circling back, last question on the COMP plan up.",31,,
212,0.97,1747.779,1755.687,Can you let me know if the proviso that Council has previously adopted in the past regarding the COMP plan update is still in place?,31,,
213,0.97,1755.687,1791.489,That proviso--and the required two in the EIS--the contract with the EIS consultant--it required that the EIS look at an alternative that looks at zoning changes in single-family areas allowing broader range of housing types in those areas and another alternative that looks at other strategies to reduce the risk of replacement--displacement.,32,,
214,0.97,1791.489,1800.999,It is tied to Opcd filing a consultant contract this year for that work.,32,,
215,0.97,1800.999,1823.454,"They appear to be on track for doing that and every conversation I have had with them, they plan on including those sorts of alternatives in that consultant contract so assuming they filed a contract this year than yes, it will be impacted and yes, the EIS will be including those alternatives.",32,,
216,0.97,1823.454,1839.737,"Very helpful and last question from you this morning, can you help me understand, is the planning for the regional growth centers, is the planning process for this growth centers fully funded in the transmittal budget?",33,,
217,0.97,1839.737,1875.006,"The transmitted budget includes $150,000 for that work . It covers six--the city's city planners and the intent is--I don't think it is fully funded.",34,,
218,0.97,1875.006,1876.507,Let's follow-up Off-Ine to fully discuss that.,35,,
219,0.97,1876.507,1879.41,That is my issue number two so we can talk about it more.,36,,
220,0.97,1879.41,1879.844,Fantastic.,37,,
221,0.97,1879.844,1887.051,"Chair, those are all of my questions.",37,,
222,0.97,1887.051,1894.259,"Any additional questions, comments as it relates to Edi, equity development initiative?",38,,
223,0.97,1894.259,1913.311,"One question to Piggybacking off of Council member Strauss's and I am sure Liz is going to get there but in terms of growth centers, the--International district is not identified as one of those areas but of course we know it is downtown and so I am interested in how--what the intersection is there.",39,,
224,0.97,1913.311,1914.846,I don't have other questions.,39,,
225,0.97,1914.846,1922.754,I have amendments that we are discussing in my office that I'm happy to talk about.,39,,
226,0.97,1922.754,1923.755,Thank you so much.,40,,
227,0.97,1923.755,1930.561,I do have a few questions on the memo.,40,,
228,0.97,1930.561,1945.143,I do want to call of the importance of the joint work for the phone that the Council did here with Prioritizing equitable development initiative funding.,40,,
229,0.97,1945.143,1956.421,You talk about there being a 250% increase in the equitable development initiative funding for the 20--over the 2021 I am a soothing--assuming that is--Jumpstart Seattle on payroll tax.,40,,
230,0.97,1956.421,1963.161,Can you confirm the resources behind that?,40,,
231,0.97,1963.161,1967.699,Correct . that's over $14 million from the Jumpstart tax.,41,,
232,0.97,1967.699,2000.732,"And then on page 2, where it says Opcd will receive $2.5 million to implement recommendations--$2.3 million of that is coming from Jumpstart and I just wanted to double check with--in the previous meeting yesterday, are the expenses being associated with the program, specifically aligned with the implementation plan that the Council has passed now twice?",42,,
233,0.97,2000.732,2002.834,Is this sort of authorized use of those funds?,42,,
234,0.97,2002.834,2007.305,That is my understanding but we will confirm that.,43,,
235,0.97,2007.305,2009.507,"Okay, great.",44,,
236,0.97,2009.507,2049.38,"And then, midway through the page there, when it relates to the Marathon strategies, industrial land use policy we know there have been a number of Stakeholders working on those recommendations are there specific policies from the Mayor's effort on industrial and Maritime strategy baked into the--changes in those policies based is based on those recommendations?",44,,
237,0.97,2049.38,2071.869,Funding to study the recommendations of the Maritime industrial task force were allocated in a supplemental budget--and so there isn't work going on right now on the environmental impact statement to analyze those recommendations.,45,,
238,0.97,2071.869,2078.242,And we anticipate getting final recommendations once--review is complete next year.,45,,
239,0.97,2078.242,2083.881,Thank you for that reminder.,46,,
240,0.97,2083.881,2105.503,"And Lastly, on the long-range planning, this may be similar to the question that Council member Strauss started with and it does lead into issue identification but when you look at long-range planning and the work that is accompanying this, were we anticipating more Ftes that would be built into this than the 0.5 noted in the memo?",46,,
241,0.97,2105.503,2109.34,Were we surprised by the 0.5 we were anticipating more Ftess would have been allocated?,46,,
242,0.97,2109.34,2133.731,"I personally did not have an expectation for staffing changes, more funding for--engagement and consultant support for the EIS, I think, is what I expected to see.",47,,
243,0.97,2133.731,2134.365,"Okay, great.",48,,
244,0.97,2134.365,2139.07,We will let you continue with that thread.,48,,
245,0.97,2139.07,2147.345,I don't see any additional hands up right now so let's take a that into issue identification.,48,,
246,0.97,2147.345,2149.38,"All right, let's go to the next page.",49,,
247,0.97,2149.38,2152.55,So first issue and we have touched on this is the comprehensive plan major update.,49,,
248,0.97,2152.55,2159.257,"As a reminder, the COMP plan is a policy document that guides growth over a 20 year period.",49,,
249,0.97,2159.257,2170.568,"It is the result of the state growth management Act and under the act, while the city is required to update its plan by June, 2024.",49,,
250,0.97,2170.568,2189.12,"The new update will focus on new growth targets adopted into the--policies . Under those policies, the city will plan for an additional 112,000 housing units and 170,000 jobs of the next 25 years.",49,,
251,0.97,2189.12,2201.632,"-- to the 20 year period of our plan that is approximately 90,000 housing units and 135,000 jobs.",49,,
252,0.97,2201.632,2205.036,This represents a 24% increase in the city's housing stock and 21% increase in employment.,49,,
253,0.97,2205.036,2217.048,This is slower than we have had as growth rate over the last 20 years but if we see this growth it will use over 70% of the city's housing and job capacity.,49,,
254,0.97,2217.048,2226.324,So with these growth targets we are getting close to the capacity we have to accommodate growth.,49,,
255,0.97,2226.324,2231.529,"Consequently, this level of growth requires the city to reassess our strategy towards accommodating growth.",49,,
256,0.97,2231.529,2249.981,The update will require an--we talked about alternatives that will be brought through a public Scoping process that will start soon.,49,,
257,0.97,2249.981,2253.684,With the scope to be developed in the first quarter of 2022.,49,,
258,0.97,2253.684,2262.193,"We talked about the budget a little bit but there is a total of $150,000 for public outreach over three years.",49,,
259,0.97,2262.193,2277.875,"And $25,000 for the environmental impact statement and consultant work it is important to support that work.",49,,
260,0.97,2277.875,2298.396,"Recent changes to state line courage for don't require that we analyze zoning changes that implement the changes of plan--as we study the policy changes, that would save time and money but require more resources and more community import.",49,,
261,0.97,2298.396,2299.397,Input.,49,,
262,0.97,2299.397,2316.013,"As mentioned, this work may require additional resources in offices other than the planning and community development Department including the planning and historic preservation survey report.",49,,
263,0.97,2316.013,2322.219,So I have three options that are not surprising.,49,,
264,0.97,2322.219,2342.239,"Add staff to this work including outreach and engagement support, increase funding for consultant work on the EIS and for historic preservation survey work in neighborhoods and those are clearly not mutually exclusive and the third option is no action.",49,,
265,0.97,2342.239,2352.149,Thank you very much.,50,,
266,0.97,2352.149,2353.784,Council member Morales I see your hand up.,50,,
267,0.97,2353.784,2354.385,"Please, go ahead.",50,,
268,0.97,2354.385,2357.688,"Yes, Lish, I just want to make sure I am understanding these processes right.",51,,
269,0.97,2357.688,2365.863,Can you share again the Timeline for the EIS conversation about the COMP plan?,51,,
270,0.97,2365.863,2389.587,And the Timeline for the EIS--I'm talking about the community engagement piece for the Maritime industrial--and this is outside of this conversation but I just want to--I'm trying to compare it with the Timeline also for the West Seattle to Ballard light rail station planning or light rail planning.,51,,
271,0.97,2389.587,2393.724,How those different processes might --,51,,
272,0.97,2393.724,2401.532,"Yes, so as a reminder, EIS is typically three phases.",52,,
273,0.97,2401.532,2417.248,The first phase is Scoping where the city will go to the public to help identify and shape the alternatives that should be studied in the environmental impact statement.,52,,
274,0.97,2417.248,2470.201,"The second phase is allocation of a draft environmental impact statement that allows the public to weigh in on the analysis that has been done and recommend changes or identify deficits in that analysis and the third phase is the final environmental impact statement where often, but not always, the preferred alternative is chosen based on certain impacts that have been identified talking about the three different processes that we may have, Scoping for the Maritime industrial study happened this year . They anticipate publishing the draft environmental impact statement--this year or early in 2022.",52,,
275,0.97,2470.201,2482.112,"And then publishing a final environmental impact statement min near year, next year so that is moving very quickly.",52,,
276,0.97,2482.112,2496.527,The Southern second for the COMP plan we are looking at Scoping being completed first quarter of 2022.,52,,
277,0.97,2496.527,2509.607,Publication of a draft EIS in 2023 and final EIS and recommendations to the Council in 2024.,52,,
278,0.97,2509.607,2516.914,And the Ballard to West Seattle environmental impact study I think would follow that.,52,,
279,0.97,2516.914,2519.35,I'm not as well versed in the Timeline for that.,52,,
280,0.97,2519.35,2521.819,I will provide those dates to you.,52,,
281,0.97,2521.819,2522.653,Thank you.,53,,
282,0.97,2522.653,2537.201,"Thank you for the question, Council--Council member Morales.",54,,
283,0.97,2537.201,2542.006,"Other any questions, comments or ideas that these are bringing up as it relates to the comprehensive plan?",54,,
284,0.97,2542.006,2553.284,I know that Council members including Council member Strauss this morning has already mentioned interest in that.,54,,
285,0.97,2553.284,2557.087,Would you like to weigh in on any of the thoughts This brings up for you?,54,,
286,0.97,2557.087,2559.69,I will go ahead and weigh in.,55,,
287,0.97,2559.69,2563.961,And Council member Morales I see you coming off mute.,55,,
288,0.97,2563.961,2570.501,"Your screen is frozen for me for some reason but I do see you coming off mute so please, go ahead.",55,,
289,0.97,2570.501,2605.436,"Thank you, I just will say that part of the point I was trying to make in my questioning with Lish is that for all of these processes, community engagement is the critical piece and since they all sort of converge in the Chinatown International district and--square area I think it is important we make sure the community engagement pieces of these processes is Well-Funded particularly since so much of what has to happen there for meaningful engagement will involve translation and interpretation services.",56,,
290,0.97,2605.436,2606.103,Thank you.,57,,
291,0.97,2606.103,2606.603,Appreciate that.,57,,
292,0.97,2606.603,2616.146,"Will set and Council members, if you would like to Chime in, please either jump in, turn your screen on or take yourself off me.",57,,
293,0.97,2616.146,2619.249,I will look for that.,57,,
294,0.97,2619.249,2623.22,"Seeing no one else coming off mute, I will echo that point.",57,,
295,0.97,2623.22,2626.323,Council member Miller malice just made the council member Strauss has made in the impact.,57,,
296,0.97,2626.323,2630.961,Appreciate that this is clearly under Resourced at this point.,57,,
297,0.97,2630.961,2661.558,Additional staff to support this work in addition to potentially increasing funding for work with consultants to make sure that the EIS is also considered as we look at the competence of plan is something I would be interested in . look forward to working with Council members here that could potentially be a combination of a and B. I know there has been a joint expression of the need to make sure there is adequate funding for the work that Opcd will be were doing on the comprehensive plan.,57,,
298,0.97,2661.558,2689.62,"The memo we have in front of us lays out the case clearly about how this engagement work has been funded in the past and I'm looking at the bottom of page 4 where it says, ""in the past years, EIS would have--received $425,000 double-digit excuse me, in this year's budget, EIS will receive 425 thousand dollars for the proposed budget.",57,,
299,0.97,2689.62,2702.733,"Of those dollars, $30,000 were allocated in the 2021 budget, 300,000 are in--2022 budget and 95,000 anticipated for 2023.",57,,
300,0.97,2702.733,2715.245,"Opcd plans to contract with consultants to take on that work however the footnote says--I love a footnote, thank you, Lish.",57,,
301,0.97,2715.245,2752.783,"The footnote says the contract for the EIS for the previous update plan was $437,000 in 2016. in 2016, those dollars to 20 $21 would have been at least $500,000 so even if we just use the amount of money allocated in 2016, we are Underfunding the investment excuse me the outreach and engagement work that we knew we needed five years ago and now we are saying in addition to the traditional outreach and engagement we want to do on the cover has a plan, we want to do so much more because we have been told to do it.",57,,
302,0.97,2752.783,2775.706,We have been told to do it because of the racial equity Toolkit that I helped to sponsor in the 2019 year when we were building the 2020 adopted budget but the work that we put into that budget required a few things to address Exclusionary zoning and displacement in that budget so that we could anticipate what was needed for the 2022 year.,57,,
303,0.97,2775.706,2788.619,"It required a racial analysis Toolkit . On Seattle's growth strategy, to ground the conversation on community experience and expertise.",57,,
304,0.97,2788.619,2793.624,It included policy options that would allow us to have diversity across the city in the environmental impact statement for the comprehensive plan update.,57,,
305,0.97,2793.624,2825.556,"And from those discussions as we heard earlier this year, on Council member Strauss's committee Oh Pcd did incredible work with policy line, community members across the region especially in the South end to have a conversation that was grounded in quantitative and qualitative data to show how, when we embark on this process of creating the Copperheads of plan, we must use the racial equity Toolkit analysis to create meaningful options to address Exclusionary zoning and combat displacement.",57,,
306,0.97,2825.556,2832.863,This was supposed to be the ground setting conversation for 2022 so that we had really robust community engagement.,57,,
307,0.97,2832.863,2860.49,"Not only are we Underfunding to the degree that we had invested in 2016, but we now have another layer of responsibility to respond to the results of that racial equity Toolkit and we know as this says on page page 5 of Lish's memo, the take away is it is more cost efficient to do the EIS analysis along with the COMP plan outreach and engagement as it relates to historic preservation.",57,,
308,0.97,2860.49,2892.155,I think that all of these are really leading to what Council member Strauss and Council member Morales have talked about and others which is a need for us to make sure that those up front funds are available so we can be more cost efficient in the long run and so we can really follow through on the initial conversations we have had with community about the need for this COMP plan to be very much rooted in those who are experiencing displacement have been historically priced out and pushed out of our city and to make sure we are more inclusive Seattle.,57,,
309,0.97,2892.155,2896.86,"So I look forward to the conversation and, Lish, I appreciate all you have done to outline why this is important.",57,,
310,0.97,2896.86,2906.937,"If I met misspoke on any data points, feel free to correct me but I really appreciate the memo that clearly outlines this.",57,,
311,0.97,2906.937,2924.254,That includes a reminder that we need to be building 4500 units a year in order for us to reach our goal of creating the 112 thousand new housing units to meet our goal over the next 25 years.,57,,
312,0.97,2924.254,2925.455,Better get to work.,57,,
313,0.97,2925.455,2926.156,Okay.,58,,
314,0.97,2926.156,2929.726,"Lish, of course, correct me if I said anything erroneous.",58,,
315,0.97,2929.726,2934.164,"Please, go ahead.",58,,
316,0.97,2934.164,2938.468,"You are on mute, Lish, sorry about that.",58,,
317,0.97,2938.468,2958.488,"Sorry, let's move to issue two . So we have heard from--regional Council which is the regional transportation planning body that we need to up date our six regional growth center plans.",59,,
318,0.97,2958.488,2964.261,Our planning documents call these urban centers.,59,,
319,0.97,2964.261,2988.885,"Six of them are in North great, North gate, District 5,--Capitol Hill, District three in downtown, uptown and South Lake Union, District 7 and to respond to the previous question, the downtown urban center does include the--International district along with--square, Belltown,--and downtown court.",59,,
320,0.97,2988.885,3006.036,"The update will require the plans to address regional collaboration and vision, environment and climate change, land use and development plans, housing, economy, transportation, public services, and racial equity.",59,,
321,0.97,3006.036,3012.743,Plans for each of these areas were adopted in the late 1990s.,59,,
322,0.97,3012.743,3014.444,Some have been updated but many have not.,59,,
323,0.97,3014.444,3021.018,They don't address topics like racial equity or climate change.,59,,
324,0.97,3021.018,3027.758,"The Mayor's budget includes $150,000 and one FTE to do this work across all six centers starting in 2022.",59,,
325,0.97,3027.758,3036.566,This will not allow for either deep community engagement or deep analysis of the issues and the updates.,59,,
326,0.97,3036.566,3050.781,"So similar to the last one, your options are to add funding, positions in Opcd to take on the work, increased consultant funding to do the work or no action.",59,,
327,0.97,3050.781,3052.783,"Thank you, Lish.",60,,
328,0.97,3052.783,3061.491,Are there any thoughts that this issue identification RAISES for you?,60,,
329,0.97,3061.491,3063.76,I'm happy.,61,,
330,0.97,3063.76,3071.068,"Please, go ahead, council member Morales no, just thank you Lish.",61,,
331,0.97,3071.068,3076.573,"We have been planning for the 1/30 and the North great North gate stuff so thank you as usual, well done.",61,,
332,0.97,3076.573,3080.21,"Smith well said, thank you, council member Morales.",61,,
333,0.97,3080.21,3082.312,"Thanks so much, Lish.",61,,
334,0.97,3082.312,3087.484,"I see Council member Morales's hand, please go ahead, council member.",61,,
335,0.97,3087.484,3090.987,I'm sure we will consider to have this conversation.,62,,
336,0.97,3090.987,3108.038,"I'm just interested to know what it would take to do this well and if $150,000 is not enough for all six areas but might be . I don't know if you have that number, Lish or if that is a conversation we will be having quite",62,,
337,0.97,3108.038,3110.941,"As a point of comparison, this is funding for the first year.",63,,
338,0.97,3110.941,3125.956,"As a point of comparison--about the cost for that--help planning effort, it was much smaller area, fewer residents, smaller scope over the last four years.",63,,
339,0.97,3125.956,3135.065,"The city has dedicated that 1.5 FTE which is equivalent to about $240,000.",63,,
340,0.97,3135.065,3150.18,"So I think in 2022, you could triple this amount of money and still be tight on cash.",63,,
341,0.97,3150.18,3155.352,Can you repeat? triple the amount of money and still?,64,,
342,0.97,3155.352,3159.489,And still they would be needing to stretch their dollars.,65,,
343,0.97,3159.489,3161.358,Interesting.,66,,
344,0.97,3161.358,3166.696,"Great question, thank you, council member Morales.",66,,
345,0.97,3166.696,3167.898,"Council member Strauss, please, go ahead.",66,,
346,0.97,3167.898,3181.144,"Thank you, echoing what Council member Juarez said about this word and picking up what Lish just said, I think options a or B are clearly needing to be investigated.",67,,
347,0.97,3181.144,3193.523,At this time I don't have a preference between a and B but just noting what Lish just said if we tripled the amount it would still be a shoestring budget so just wanted to put that out there.,67,,
348,0.97,3193.523,3194.124,Excellent.,68,,
349,0.97,3194.124,3194.724,Thank you very much.,68,,
350,0.97,3194.724,3195.625,Okay.,68,,
351,0.97,3195.625,3205.202,"I appreciate that, council member and I don't see a show of hands so let's move to the final issue identified by staffing.",68,,
352,0.97,3205.202,3221.885,So Council members are very aware that the development initiative and strategic investment fund but very briefly they fund grants for community initiated projects and commit to mitigate impacts from displacement.,69,,
353,0.97,3221.885,3228.325,-- by Puck communities and increase opportunities for those communities.,69,,
354,0.97,3228.325,3230.76,-- communities.,69,,
355,0.97,3230.76,3234.064,Edi grants are funded through the payroll tax.,69,,
356,0.97,3234.064,3253.183,"$13.9 million of payroll tax funding going to grants . The short-term rental tax, $5 million in 2022 and the community development--of 400 million dollars.",69,,
357,0.97,3253.183,3257.787,The Edi staff are funded through the payroll tax and general fund through 2022.,69,,
358,0.97,3257.787,3265.095,It is a clear demand for equitable development funding.,69,,
359,0.97,3265.095,3280.677,The Edi receives funding allocation for 2021 four $20 million they were able to fund 20 one of those projects with $9.8 million.,69,,
360,0.97,3280.677,3303.833,"In 2021, the list there was--strategic investment fund or SII . The intent of that funding was to provide--over 100 applications over $500 million.",69,,
361,0.97,3303.833,3309.506,The city was able to fund 13 of those projects totaling $30 million.,69,,
362,0.97,3309.506,3317.747,The--is not continuing into the future but Edi funds can be used for the proposition of activities--.,69,,
363,0.97,3317.747,3354.117,"So your options are to add funding and staff for Edi projects, add funding and staff for some of the sift projects funded in 2021 or no action under either alternative a or B of the Edi advisory report which would likely help to advise on most equitable--funds given that it is unlikely we will have $530 million of additional funding to provide for these projects.",69,,
364,0.97,3356.019,3358.888,Wonderful.,70,,
365,0.97,3358.888,3361.291,"Thoughts, reactions, questions, Council members?",70,,
366,0.97,3361.291,3365.161,"Please go ahead, council member Morales.",70,,
367,0.97,3365.161,3374.904,Madam chair is this the time to talk about other amendments where we are considering or are you just asking for a response here?,71,,
368,0.97,3374.904,3378.408,Let's do quick responses to this one and then I will call you for additional items.,72,,
369,0.97,3378.408,3379.609,Thank you 14 those up.,72,,
370,0.97,3379.609,3391.721,"I will jump in with a quick thank you, Lish, for identifying that the Edi board under either scenario would still have an opportunity to do final selection.",72,,
371,0.97,3391.721,3407.337,One of the questions I was grappling with was does the city council sit in the position of saying all of these other grants from the Mercer Mayor sale will qualify but didn't make it so we wanted to fund those pieces.,72,,
372,0.97,3407.337,3434.931,That is not typically the role the Council play so you are saying that we could choose to increase staffing and increase funding to help support some of the projects that had applied under the Mercer mega sale for the strategic investment son that were not funded but it was still be up to the Edi board to identify which of those met X criteria and they would have the final selection of that.,72,,
373,0.97,3434.931,3436.065,Is that accurate?,72,,
374,0.97,3436.065,3453.283,"Yes, that is kind of what we have set up the Edi program today and I would recommend continuing to rely on community expertise in terms of--most appropriate --",73,,
375,0.97,3453.283,3453.683,Okay.,74,,
376,0.97,3453.683,3482.512,"And your memo in the presentation is helpful because I think initially when we had the departments present, there was some question in my mind of whether or not the proposed budget was proposing extending on an annual basis the Mercer mega sale which we all know was due to a one-time sale of the large parcel of public land which we have since put in policies to protect against doing wholesale sales like that in the future but as part of the commitment to community identifying 30 million so it was one time in nature.",74,,
377,0.97,3482.512,3489.419,This is a really question of we have opportunity to recognize there is X amount of projects that didn't get funded.,74,,
378,0.97,3489.419,3500.363,"But the budget as we have received it, is a proposing to extend the Sif program because I thought the answer was no quite",74,,
379,0.97,3500.363,3501.03,Know.,75,,
380,0.97,3501.03,3525.755,It is slightly confusing where it discusses the payroll tax funds being allocated to Opcd as an extension of the Sif but the intent of the payroll taxes always to provide 90% of its funding for Edi projects and that is what you are seeing in the project.,75,,
381,0.97,3525.755,3529.425,The theme continues so thank you very much for that.,76,,
382,0.97,3529.425,3533.129,"Alley, I see you on screen as well.",76,,
383,0.97,3533.129,3533.563,Go ahead.,76,,
384,0.97,3533.563,3541.371,I just wanted to add because this came up in the general fund balancing analysis discussion yesterday and was noted in the paper and as list noted is somewhat confusing.,77,,
385,0.97,3541.371,3604.2,"All these names of funds that were set aside and actual fund that was established like the jump start Fund and different initiatives and so I think from central staff's perspective, what is less confusing is these funds are part of the equitable development initiative moving forward . The strategic investment funds from the Mercer sale were a one-time process and moving forward, this money is really implementation of the jump start fund of policies and the payroll tax spending plan and to avoid confusion of all of these buckets of money and how all of the community engages and applies for funds moving forward would be simpler to go with this is part of the equitable development initiative portion of the funds described as Sif and the proposed budget also going to the office of housing supporting office of housing program so I think it is simpler to just do away with that term of--moving forward.",77,,
386,0.97,3604.2,3604.801,I appreciate that.,78,,
387,0.97,3604.801,3607.503,I have been making a mark on my own documents as well.,78,,
388,0.97,3607.503,3609.038,This is really Edi.,78,,
389,0.97,3609.038,3620.416,"Excellent Pics--okay thank you, Lish and I will ask Council member Morales if you have other issues you would like to put on your colleagues' radar?",78,,
390,0.97,3620.416,3621.017,Thank you.,79,,
391,0.97,3621.017,3634.764,"I will say first that I do support adding funding and stuff for Edi projects so I appreciate all that you are doing there, Lish, to help us understand what that could mean.",79,,
392,0.97,3634.764,3639.268,I did want to highlight a couple other things that our office is working on for my colleagues to consider.,79,,
393,0.97,3639.268,3662.592,One is an amendment that really Aligns the proposed funding for commercial acquisition with our community development strategies at Edi so the amendment would shift funding that is dedicated to commercial acquisition at--and add some additional funding and move it to Edi.,79,,
394,0.97,3662.592,3716.512,"So we know that--and I do want to say that I think Oed, Edi and office of housing have been working together on these kind of acquisition strategies so I anticipate that would continue but since Edi has the clear experience of getting money out the door quickly as the demonstrated this year, and is focused on the community development piece it makes sense to move in that direction and another thing keeping with the conversation, we have been having about community engagement and the need for a new community plan, we also have a budget amendment to support the Chinatown International district who wants to create their neighborhood plan and did receive a little bit of funding in the past.",79,,
395,0.97,3716.512,3745.675,We will be trying to add funding for that community engagement as we have been talking about that requires a little more intensive support for the need for translation and interpretation services but the amendment would allocate staff to Opcd since the point is to create a neighborhood plan accepted by the city as part of Opcd.,79,,
396,0.97,3745.675,3753.75,It would also support the community and engaging a consultant to assist with their engagement work.,79,,
397,0.97,3753.75,3758.554,I do have a couple--I want to say one more thing.,79,,
398,0.97,3758.554,3758.888,Sorry.,79,,
399,0.97,3758.888,3774.704,"We have also been working to get a better understanding of what it means to build an equitable economy, to build some coherent community wealth strategies.",79,,
400,0.97,3774.704,3782.612,We have invested as a city across lots of different departments that impacts income and equality and restricted Land-Use policies.,79,,
401,0.97,3782.612,3811.307,"We are working on an amendment that would provide funding to do the research to help create a coordinated approach among our different departments that can really build a consistent letter of strong neighborhoods, economic opportunity and build toward a comprehensive community wealth building strategy for the city.",79,,
402,0.97,3811.307,3816.646,That one is still in the works but wanted to give folks a heads up that we are hoping to get some support for that too.,79,,
403,0.97,3816.646,3817.647,That is all I have.,79,,
404,0.97,3817.647,3818.08,Thank you.,79,,
405,0.97,3818.08,3821.751,"Thank you for flagging those, council member Morales okay.",80,,
406,0.97,3821.751,3831.06,"Well, I have received confirmation that Council member Strauss has nothing further at this point.",80,,
407,0.97,3831.06,3832.328,I want to thank you all.,80,,
408,0.97,3832.328,3873.302,"If there is nothing else for us on Opcd, again, thanks, Lish for all the time you put into this memo and I think we will continue to ground ourselves on how we must act with urgency as we look at the data provided at the top of page 3. it is not just about planning community development, not just about having a home but especially in the wake of Covid knowing you need a place to call home and number two, be healthy, the staff is really Compellng to look at the last 10 years and how we have changed as a pit as a city, growth and population and how we need to act with urgency to catch up so thanks so much for the work on owe much much more is to come.",80,,
409,0.97,3873.302,3875.571,Let's go on to item number two.,80,,

418,0.97,3903.699,3929.892,"So they are connected in many ways and for the purposes of our discussion here, are separated especially because as we think about the homeless services largely being Transitioned over to the regional homelessness authority, we have Bifurcated the discussions appropriately so human services and community led investments and we will let Amy go through the presentation.",82,,
419,0.97,3929.892,3941.27,I know there is some crossover on this topic area but I will turn to Council member Herbal the first and our chair of human services and public safety to offer comments or questions as we wrap up the overview before we go into issue identification.,82,,

432,0.97,4011.941,4019.715,"As you can see this has the largest impact on the homelessness division which as you mentioned, chair, will be covered by Jeff Simms this afternoon.",84,,
433,0.97,4019.715,4024.92,In addition there is a slight reduction in the preparing you for success division.,84,,
434,0.97,4024.92,4041.17,The largest increase is funding in the supported safe communities division which includes community safety programs which will be discussed tomorrow during the alternatives to policing and criminal legal system presentation.,84,,
435,0.97,4041.17,4048.344,The general fund contribution to the Department's budget decreases from $174.9 million to $171.3 million.,84,,
436,0.97,4048.344,4056.352,While other sources of funds decreased from $126 billion to $115 million and I'm going to discuss this in more detail in just a moment.,84,,
437,0.97,4056.352,4059.655,"Next slide please, Patty?",84,,
438,0.97,4059.655,4065.394,The second slide shows the 2021 and 2022 budgets for community led investments.,85,,
439,0.97,4065.394,4074.804,"As you can see, purchase of story budgeting increases from $28.3 million which was one time funds to $30 million per year of ongoing funds.",85,,
440,0.97,4074.804,4090.786,"Similarly, the equitable communities initiative increased from $29.9 million of one-time funds to $30 million per year of ongoing funds which was discussed yesterday during the general fund balance presentation.",85,,
441,0.97,4090.786,4095.424,In addition in the 2022 budget there are 11.5 FTE to support these programs.,85,,
442,0.97,4095.424,4096.559,"Next slide, please?",86,,
443,0.97,4096.559,4108.604,The third slide goes into more details on the source of Hst funds.,87,,
444,0.97,4108.604,4114.543,"As you can see in 2019, the Department's budget was $199 billion with $125 million from general Fund and $74 million from the human services Fund.",87,,
445,0.97,4114.543,4118.848,"The human services fund is comprised of outside grant funding, mostly from state or Federal programs.",87,,
446,0.97,4118.848,4128.557,"In 2020, this--we increased by over 25% in response to the Covid pandemic.",87,,
447,0.97,4128.557,4136.465,That included an increase of $50 million in general fund dollars and an additional $35 million from outside sources.,87,,
448,0.97,4136.465,4157.586,In 2021 the trend continued with an additional $100 million over Pre-Covid spending with half of those funds coming from general Fund and an additional $44 million coming from outside grant and the addition of $4.7 million sweetened beverage tax funds and $3.4 million of rental tax funds.,87,,
449,0.97,4157.586,4165.594,The proposed 2022 budget has a slight reduction in general fund contribution from $174.9 million to $171.3 million.,87,,
450,0.97,4165.594,4177.473,"In addition, the human services fund or outside funding sources reduces from $118.5 million to $72.8 million.",87,,
451,0.97,4177.473,4191.487,This is slightly offset by increase of $24.8 million from Coronavirus local fiscal recovery funds which are called--funds as well as the addition of 98 point million--and payroll tax.,87,,
452,0.97,4191.487,4196.392,I want to correct an error that is in Hst.,87,,
453,0.97,4196.392,4202.131,On page 3 of wrote that that was part of the reduction to the human services Fund.,87,,
454,0.97,4202.131,4215.311,Does CB Digi community block friend grants was a total number I was looking at and the reduction was $5.8 million so thank you for the opportunity to correct that.,87,,
455,0.97,4215.311,4221.05,On pages four and five there is a brief overview of the changes in the departments budget.,87,,
456,0.97,4221.05,4224.119,-- I did want to highlight one item.,87,,
457,0.97,4224.119,4252.815,The budget includes $4.6 million to increase in existing contracts with providers which is required by ordinance 125.865 passed in 2019 however the inflationary amount included in the budget 2.4% is less than what is required by--and the increase should be 3.0 percent . that will be addressed in the Arata amendment which will--inflationary increases to provider contracts.,87,,
458,0.97,4252.815,4262.191,I will pause here to and questions on the slides or the Hst budget in general before moving onto--.,87,,
459,0.97,4262.191,4271.767,Wonderful.,88,,
460,0.97,4271.767,4274.37,Vice chair Herbold would you like to offer any questions or comments?,88,,
461,0.97,4274.37,4275.471,Thank you so much.,89,,
462,0.97,4275.471,4292.121,"Madam chair and Amy, one of the things that is very noticeable that I am not really seeing or understanding what the impact is of such a large reduction in revenues from the human services Fund.",89,,
463,0.97,4292.121,4298.494,"What does that have, what impact does that create for 2023?",89,,
464,0.97,4298.494,4323.752,"Because we can expect that some of the revenue sources that are making up part of the difference in 2022 will not be available anymore, for instance the Clipper funds and so what will that do as far as creating greater gaps to fill in 2023?",89,,
465,0.97,4323.752,4325.22,Right.,90,,
466,0.97,4325.22,4334.196,"Certainly, it will be a reduction because there will be even less of the one time Covid response funding.",90,,
467,0.97,4334.196,4367.096,"However, some of these funds even though they are adopted in a particular year's budget can be used for multiple years so I can work, I don't have it on hand but I can work on what that might look like in 2023, what the expended expected funding is of the funds for a particular year but without further changes and without further infusion of other outside funding, would result in additional reductions in 2023.",90,,
468,0.97,4367.096,4373.769,Thank you . Then can you go back one slide?,91,,
469,0.97,4373.769,4375.504,I guess maybe more than one slide?,91,,
470,0.97,4375.504,4378.273,That is the one right there.,91,,
471,0.97,4378.273,4438.867,"So that represents seven--and your issue paper highlights I think six of these seven and does not include providing public health because I understand that is an Mou with public health but there is an increase of 19% there and would just really like to have a more understanding I think not you, Amy but central staff is working on that but I would really like to have more of a conversation about our investments through our--with public health particularly as it relates to mental health investments so just flagging that as an issue, not identified issue identification which I understand we are going to go into in just a bit.",91,,
472,0.97,4438.867,4444.072,I think those are my main comments on this portion of the agenda.,91,,
473,0.97,4444.072,4453.081,I will want to ask some other questions once we get into issue I.D.,91,,
474,0.97,4453.081,4465.527,Vice chair Herbold I started working with your staff on that so I will be working more on the details you are interested in.,92,,
475,0.97,4465.527,4472.301,I do want to flag that in the public health Psl that is about a $2.5 million difference and Abu $1 million is transfer.,92,,
476,0.97,4472.301,4484.546,"We have--mobile crisis team previously was addressing homelessness Psl which is a one Million-Dollar ad we made and should be in the--public health--so that's about half of that actually just--technical change, not actually changes.",92,,
477,0.97,4484.546,4485.28,Got it.,93,,
478,0.97,4485.28,4490.419,That is reminding me of a question.,93,,
479,0.97,4490.419,4506.635,Wondering why the mobile crisis teams as identified on page 4 of the memo is moved to the youth and family empowerment division instead of being moved to save and driving immunities?,93,,
480,0.97,4506.635,4518.647,I believe that is because it is through--because that is funded through public health that there is an alignment in that way.,94,,
481,0.97,4518.647,4533.262,"Actually--public health there is actually contracted with the county, the Department services, behavioral health and recovery division so I think that it is a bureaucratic organization.",95,,
482,0.97,4533.262,4552.681,"As you know, council member, it was basically one staff person that has mostly handled our public health contract for four years and that has been at various times in almost every DSL in every division so it has changed a lot but I can ask more and make sure there are no Otherdetails behind that.",95,,
483,0.97,4552.681,4553.849,"Great, thank you.",96,,
484,0.97,4553.849,4564.359,And then I'm going to flag for the listing public in case folks are concerned about this.,96,,
485,0.97,4564.359,4594.423,"On page 5, there is a reference to removal of one time funding and I believe some of this is also part of a county transfer maybe not in a local agreement but perhaps but the $1.2 million drug user health services and $200,000 general fund for harm reduction General services the narrative says removal of one time funding.",96,,
486,0.97,4594.423,4604.833,I want to clarify the reason why that is is because we have we have transferred dollars double this Rfp.,96,,
487,0.97,4604.833,4605.834,--,96,,
488,0.97,4605.834,4624.553,I actually--those funds to give a broader history and you are well versed obviously on the Funder scheme from a set aside of one-time funds held in finance general.,97,,
489,0.97,4624.553,4626.555,Last year was the first time they were appropriated.,97,,
490,0.97,4626.555,4633.161,They were at one time dollars and the perhaps the language is a little misleading there and it was one-time funds that there is not a continuing source for it to my knowledge.,97,,
491,0.97,4633.161,4640.135,I can double check that but so that would be the change that is occurring there and why it is legal as a one time correction.,97,,
492,0.97,4640.135,4640.535,Yes.,98,,
493,0.97,4640.535,4640.969,All good.,98,,
494,0.97,4640.969,4641.77,Thank you very much.,98,,
495,0.97,4641.77,4649.177,"Thank you, vice chair Herbold.",99,,
496,0.97,4649.177,4650.345,I don't see any additional hands.,99,,
497,0.97,4650.345,4665.761,"I have a few questions and thanks for tuning up the questions around the removal of one-time funding, page 5, item number four--I, too was concerned about that so I just want to make sure I have a clear understanding of what is currently happening.",99,,
498,0.97,4665.761,4682.778,Public health Seattle King County is working to get contracts out the door to find community harm reduction strategies that are in compliance with existing law and are oriented towards public health interventions and treatment.,99,,
499,0.97,4682.778,4684.68,Those dollars will be able to be used in 2022.,99,,
500,0.97,4684.68,4690.385,Is there any concern about those dollars being used in 2022 are are we all good to make sure that the funding --,99,,
501,0.97,4690.385,4692.421,I can send you the rf be --,100,,
502,0.97,4692.421,4694.723,That sounded positive.,101,,
503,0.97,4694.723,4706.501,"Yes, affirmation that we have no concerns about those grants continuing to 2020 Poop--2022.",101,,
504,0.97,4706.501,4709.438,And Jeff Simms I want to introduce you for the record.,101,,
505,0.97,4709.438,4733.662,"Thanks . The other two items that were concerning to me and perhaps fall into the same vein of pink used by somebody else, is there a continuation of the $33,000 for native indigenous children and families and $200,000 for harm reduction programs or are those going to be doubly some form of a --",101,,
506,0.97,4733.662,4737.766,I can only speak to the native American funding.,102,,
507,0.97,4737.766,4739.868,That is a one-time reduction.,102,,
508,0.97,4739.868,4752.447,There is an offsetting new addition of ongoing funding of $1.2 million for American Indian and Alaska native communities.,102,,
509,0.97,4752.447,4758.386,And that includes--I can tell you this right now.,102,,
510,0.97,4758.386,4767.796,That is $1.2 million which is broken into a couple of things but should cover some of that gap.,102,,
511,0.97,4767.796,4769.297,"-- of the removal of the $33,000.",102,,
512,0.97,4769.297,4771.9,Okay and is there--sorry.,103,,
513,0.97,4771.9,4772.901,Council member Clark,104,,
514,0.97,4772.901,4789.251,"I was going to say $200,000 for harm reduction programs is, my relic recollection is it is not service dollars but designed as one point funding to make in many cases physical changes to the configuration of spaces.",105,,
515,0.97,4789.251,4809.905,"We approved it in a prior budget action from the harm reduction coalition I think because who proposed it but I can give you more of a granular detail of what those dollars are supposed to be used for about they are, by design, supposed to be one-time funds.",105,,
516,0.97,4809.905,4825.754,"Very helpful, thank you, council member and Amy on the $33,000 for native children and families, if you will confirm for us that that is indeed being picked up in this other $1.2 million?",106,,
517,0.97,4825.754,4830.058,That has also been allocated?,106,,
518,0.97,4830.058,4832.06,You don't have to confirm right now.,106,,
519,0.97,4832.06,4835.53,I just--we can circle back on that.,106,,
520,0.97,4835.53,4836.131,--,107,,
521,0.97,4836.131,4842.304,Okay and if we could go to slide number--I do not see a number on my sheet.,108,,
522,0.97,4842.304,4843.371,Four?,108,,
523,0.97,4843.371,4844.172,Perfect.,108,,
524,0.97,4844.172,4845.073,Thank you.,108,,
525,0.97,4845.073,4847.542,"Oh, one more back.",108,,
526,0.97,4847.542,4850.178,I have to ask this.,108,,
527,0.97,4850.178,4866.194,Can you confirm for us if the payroll expense utilization here is in alignment or out of alignment with the spend plan that the city council authorized--?,108,,
528,0.97,4866.194,4875.07,The payroll expense tax in the Hst budget is used primarily for homelessness.,109,,
529,0.97,4875.07,4882.51,"The one exception for that is there is $403,000 for the continuation of the pilot program.",109,,
530,0.97,4882.51,4910.338,"That is a program that allows Seattle police Department, fire Department, to call crisis connections to get help when they are dealing with a behavioral or mental health crisis and we will discuss that a little more but again, with the remaining--you know, the balance of about nine point something million is for homelessness services that Jeff can discuss.",109,,
531,0.97,4910.338,4914.309,Okay.,110,,
532,0.97,4914.309,4940.035,"Chair Mosqueda, just a note here, about $3.7 million of the payroll tax revenue from the jump start fund in Hsd's budget is what we identified yesterday in discussions as from our review is inconsistent with the jump start fund policies that is funding homeless services and crisis connections call that Amy just described.",110,,
533,0.97,4940.035,4965.493,About $6 million is used for funding with Federal Vouches to provide services to housing units which is open to interpretation but the funding in jump start for housing was inclusive of providing services at affordable housing development and so we did identify that as consistent but that is ultimately your call.,110,,
534,0.97,4965.493,4966.895,I agree.,111,,
535,0.97,4966.895,4969.597,Thank you for noting the inconsistency there.,111,,
536,0.97,4969.597,4988.817,"And then Lastly, I want to double check on the Orange--excuse me, on the blue bar here for Coronavirus local relief Fund . This is the American rescue plan dollars and also known as the Seattle rescue plan.",111,,
537,0.97,4988.817,4998.993,I am looking at a chart here that was just sent down on the amount of dollars the city has expended using these dollars.,111,,
538,0.97,4998.993,5011.039,I'm looking specifically at the--Department and I'm surprised to see $0 of the amount we allocated for this has and spent.,111,,
539,0.97,5011.039,5017.812,Am I reading this correctly?,111,,
540,0.97,5017.812,5030.759,"If you haven't had a chance to look at it, it is relatively new but do you have any indication of how much has been spent from these funds that we already allocated for things like Deborah program and--and aid to Nonprofits?",111,,
541,0.97,5030.759,5039.367,I do not have an opportunity to review that but I'm happy to track that for you and Follow- up.,112,,
542,0.97,5039.367,5043.972,Great and I know that chair and I will be diving into those details so thank you for the work on that.,113,,
543,0.97,5043.972,5045.407,Let's get it issue identification.,114,,
544,0.97,5045.407,5047.075,One other quick thing.,115,,
545,0.97,5047.075,5068.763,"If I could just confirm if there hasn't been identified as an issue, whether or not there is more information about the correction on the contract inflation consistent with ordinance 125865?",115,,
546,0.97,5068.763,5080.141,The memo on page 5 suggest that it will be corrected in Arano but I'm not quite sure whether or not we need to take that up?,115,,
547,0.97,5080.141,5093.721,Cbo--what I have been provided by see Po is they will include that in the Errata amendment they sent out and we will double check that it is in there after that has been sent out.,116,,
548,0.97,5093.721,5094.589,Thank you.,117,,
549,0.97,5094.589,5117.946,City of Seattle though is vice chair Herbold I would just add that we have funds available to support that end in consideration of other Council priorities we are working on identifying a strategy to make sure that correction is made without Impacting balancing other--for other reasons so thanks.,118,,
550,0.97,5117.946,5120.014,"Great, thank you so much.",119,,
551,0.97,5120.014,5120.748,Okay.,119,,
552,0.97,5120.748,5121.316,Issue identification.,119,,
553,0.97,5121.316,5122.317,Here we go.,119,,
554,0.97,5122.317,5123.184,Great.,120,,
555,0.97,5123.184,5125.92,So I have three issues to present.,120,,
556,0.97,5125.92,5131.459,The first is related to access.,120,,
557,0.97,5131.459,5136.831,As noted in the paper there was a significant amount of increased funding for food prep programs in response to the Covid pandemic.,120,,
558,0.97,5136.831,5146.074,From 60--the budget increased from $16.5 million in 2019 to a high of $28.6 million in 2020.,120,,
559,0.97,5146.074,5154.983,The 2022 proposed budget includes a total of $18.6 million for food programs for these key food programs.,120,,
560,0.97,5154.983,5169.764,To reduce the impact of these decreases the proposed budget includes $2.5 million in Coronavirus local fiscal recovery funds to provide what they call transitional or ramp down funding.,120,,
561,0.97,5169.764,5192.72,That--those funds are used to kind of make the decrease a little more gradual rather than a much--rather them them being a more significant accused decrease this year.,120,,
562,0.97,5192.72,5201.829,"$2.5 million is intended to support $220,000 for the ethnic grocery bags, $1 million for meals and permanent supportive housing units and shelters and $1.28 million for food banks.",120,,
563,0.97,5201.829,5209.504,"In response to this, the Council could choose to increas one time funding to minimize service reductions in 2022.",120,,
564,0.97,5209.504,5230.358,Or the Council could choose to provide ongoing funding to sustain in case investments in food programs and to fully restore funding to 2021 levels would require an additional $8 million or the Council could take no action.,120,,
565,0.97,5230.358,5236.03,Vice chair Herbold?,121,,
566,0.97,5236.03,5239.334,I want to express how concerned I am about this investment area.,122,,
567,0.97,5239.334,5263.591,And concerned that what is being described as a ramp down is not going to meet the need in our community . We met with Hst during Department presentations . We have asked whether or not there was information to believe that there was a decrease in need.,122,,
568,0.97,5263.591,5296.557,"What we learned, was not that there was a decrease in need but they could quantify and now many people will be served using the resources.",122,,
569,0.97,5296.557,5311.172,Just really wanting to flag that I'm interested in doing what we can to ensure that the 2021 levels of food and nutrition supports be funded.,122,,
570,0.97,5311.172,5331.893,It's $26.6 million for the entire thing of 2022 and would be interested in looking at a combination of counsel appropriated funds and the new state and Federal resources that are expected to be available through 2022 and so I'm proposing a second option.,122,,
571,0.97,5331.893,5359.053,I guess I should say a 4TH option to what is proposed here which would be to provide funding for six months worth of full funding for 2022 with a slide directing Hsd to get back to us about what they expect in the state and Federal funds.,122,,
572,0.97,5359.053,5375.536,Also with a statement that if the fund resources do not make the budget--the food and nutrition budget whole as compared to--21 levels that we would take another look at fills those gaps.,122,,
573,0.97,5375.536,5377.572,Just wanting to put that out there.,122,,
574,0.97,5377.572,5381.909,Thank you Councilmember for signaling that.,123,,
575,0.97,5386.547,5392.82,I know this is part of how we address that shadow pandemic.,123,,
576,0.97,5392.82,5396.758,Mental health well being along with physical health.,123,,
577,0.97,5396.758,5400.128,Have you to have access to healthy food.,123,,
578,0.97,5400.128,5401.262,The human services coalition.,123,,
579,0.97,5401.262,5409.771,Very detailed request for support in the food delivery and meal system is incredibly compelling as well.,123,,
580,0.97,5411.939,5421.983,I look forward to identifying the issues and also wanted to flag along with that is the ongoing need for vans and vehicles to deliver the foods.,123,,
581,0.97,5421.983,5426.921,Something I heard a lot about as well.,123,,
582,0.97,5426.921,5438.366,It doesn't sound like in the proposed budget there is a Ramping up of food vehicle delivery options if we are Ramping down some of these other services.,123,,
583,0.97,5438.366,5443.538,I think that's a problem in my view if that is not included.,123,,
584,0.97,5443.538,5448.075,I'm not aware of any additional funding for that.,124,,
585,0.97,5448.075,5448.342,Okay.,125,,
586,0.97,5448.342,5461.956,Well appreciate you flapping that and Pairing the food delivery and the vehicles to get the food there I think is something I would love to hear more about as we dive into this budget together.,126,,
587,0.97,5461.956,5462.156,Okay.,126,,
588,0.97,5462.156,5465.793,If there is nothing else let's go to the next item.,126,,
589,0.97,5465.793,5469.43,Great.,127,,
590,0.97,5469.43,5472.099,"Next slide please, Patty.",127,,
591,0.97,5472.099,5477.805,The second issue relates to Particapator budgeting.,127,,
592,0.97,5477.805,5481.809,It included 28.3 million in one time funds for Budgetingn.,127,,
593,0.97,5481.809,5488.282,June the Council set aside over a million of this funding to the office for civil rights and created three positions.,127,,
594,0.97,5488.282,5501.496,"This funding the associated positions were added to work with community to sleep an issue, a request for proposal to select a third party administrator to negotiate and manage the contract and to staff the budgeting program.",127,,
595,0.97,5501.496,5507.635,It's expected that the positions will be filled and the request for proposal also be issued by late October.,127,,
596,0.97,5507.635,5525.186,"Because the budgeting process will likely not start until 2022, 27.2 million of funds both for the process and for the selective projects remains in financial general Resense.",127,,
597,0.97,5525.186,5531.592,The 2022 proposed budget includes $30 million of new ongoing general fund dollars for budgeting along with the 2021 funding.,127,,
598,0.97,5531.592,5537.598,This would result in a total of 57.2 million.,127,,
599,0.97,5547.408,5560.922,The counsel could choose to change the proposed at for budgeting for ongoing one time funding and state ounces intent to identity ongoing revenue source to support the investments.,127,,
600,0.97,5563.591,5589.55,They could cut some or all of the Jeb fund in 2022 recognizing that much of the 2021 Appropriatations for budgeting will carry forward into 2022 and redirect the funds to other Council identified priorities and reduce the impact of the drastic funding reduction in year two or 2023 of the program.,127,,
601,0.97,5589.55,5594.622,The third option is the Council could take no action.,127,,
602,0.97,5594.622,5595.456,Thank you.,128,,
603,0.97,5595.456,5603.497,This is a good continuation of our conversation from yesterday as well.,128,,
604,0.97,5603.497,5607.301,"Colleagues, comments or questions, Councilmember Morales?",128,,
605,0.97,5607.301,5607.501,Yeah.,128,,
606,0.97,5607.501,5607.868,Please go head.,128,,
607,0.97,5607.868,5608.603,Thank you.,129,,
608,0.97,5608.603,5618.679,I will admit I was going to talk about this tomorrow since I--little confuses about the Hsd but whatever.,129,,
609,0.97,5618.679,5623.651,"Thank you very much, Amy for presenting this.",129,,
610,0.97,5623.651,5629.924,"So, what I will say about the budgeting, we know that it is beginning next year.",129,,
611,0.97,5629.924,5642.436,The process will begin and I think was an important decision by all of us to start to see some power and decision making resources to the community.,129,,
612,0.97,5642.436,5652.646,I want to talk about the fun source as we are having this conversation about $11 million of the budgeting fund came from the SPD budget.,129,,
613,0.97,5652.646,5669.797,I think in keeping the commitment to move toward funding upstream solutions and community investments that really work toward getting at the root cause of some of the community conditions that we have.,129,,
614,0.97,5669.797,5676.003,This is still a very important initiative for us to support and continue.,129,,
615,0.97,5676.003,5683.644,Am still interested in funding from Asd to help fund the budgeting Allocatian for 2022.,129,,
616,0.97,5683.644,5695.79,I just want to say that as we start to consider some of the recent investments I do think we also need to consider shifting our thinking on what baseline budgeting looks like.,129,,
617,0.97,5695.79,5710.337,We are trying to make some important structural changes like establishing budgeting and I think it means that we also change where our baseline funding goes.,129,,
618,0.97,5710.337,5725.052,"So, I hope my colleagues will consider a realignment in some of the funding that we have to normally done so that he with can support the important work that we started at PB and I look forward to continuing this conversation.",129,,
619,0.97,5725.052,5725.753,Thank you.,130,,
620,0.97,5725.753,5726.153,"Yes, absolutely.",130,,
621,0.97,5726.153,5730.791,If you would like to bring up more comments about this tomorrow in the conversation.,130,,
622,0.97,5730.791,5732.059,That will be welcomed as well.,130,,
623,0.97,5732.059,5747.208,"I would like to build on some of the comment that you said and agree that it's important that we make sure that the seeds we started planting this year, that we continue to allow for them to come to pass and be successful next year.",130,,
624,0.97,5747.208,5758.385,"I think that similar to the conversations we had yesterday, regarding the equal community initiative task force there is a large amount of fund that is under spent in 2021.",130,,
625,0.97,5758.385,5820.648,"You don't normally see that reflected in a 2022 budget unless it's expressly sort of drawing out and what I would love to do with all of you is look at how we can recognize that much of the 2021 Appropriatation has not been spent and carried forward into 2022 making sure that full amount up to 30 million is reflected in a 2022 budget meaning for example if 25 million were unspent in this year, we would show up with the amount in next year's budget to add another five million to really keep us after the $30 million that was promised and that is something that I mentioned yesterday and I think that is in alignment, realigning the priorities, appreciate Councilmember Morales, the call for us to also recognize that this is a way for us to shift funding from traditional police responses into investments and the continuation of that discussion from last year is going to be important.",130,,
626,0.97,5820.648,5828.455,I think that it's some--of be here for me and making sure that we show it up and keep it at a $30 million amount.,130,,
627,0.97,5828.455,5831.659,"So, that the full investment commitment is maintained for 2022.",130,,
628,0.97,5831.659,5839.266,"That's something I will be interested in working with all of you on and Councilmember Morales all of you, about that.",130,,
629,0.97,5839.266,5847.141,In any of our conversations today or tomorrow as it relates to a public safety as well.,130,,
630,0.97,5847.141,5889.416,"I was just going to respond by briefly--I know that Council speaks a lot about the kind of continuation of upstream funding as it relates to community safety and rightly acknowledges that a lot of our upstream investments in housing and food support and all of the things we are talking about today really do impact public safety and community safety and so, finding that dividing line between what the social services and what is community safety is sometimes a judgment call but certainly you know anything that we discussed today and tomorrow all going to the same place.",131,,
631,0.97,5889.416,5895.723,Whatever the conversation takes place will make sure to cover it and get it done.,131,,
632,0.97,5895.723,5896.19,Thank you.,132,,
633,0.97,5896.19,5903.998,Them the last comment I would make on this is about having real investments in community.,132,,
634,0.97,5903.998,5938.932,I think also recognizes that you don't want to pull that rug out from anyone or create a cliff whether that's--capping in half the amount of money or capping in half the amount of organizations that are able to receive awards as you know the funding would not be available year over year at that elevated amount and I think that really wanting to set the community up for success and maintaining a commitment to the $30 million mark is something that I will continue to center in these discussions with all of you.,132,,
635,0.97,5938.932,5940.367,Appreciate that NOTE in your fact here.,132,,
636,0.97,5940.367,5941.902,Let's move onto number three.,132,,
637,0.97,5941.902,5942.236,Great.,133,,
638,0.97,5942.236,5949.777,The third issue and we don't have to spend too much time on this since you discussed it yesterday.,133,,
639,0.97,5949.777,5961.555,"Very briefly, the 2022 proposed budget establishes 30 million in ongoing funding for the equal community's initiative projects but doesn't identity any revenue source for this investment.",133,,
640,0.97,5961.555,5969.83,These funds are in addition to the 30 million in project funding adopted in September of this year which are anticipated to mostly be expended during 202.,133,,
641,0.97,5969.83,5981.075,As discussed yesterday the Council could choose to change the Appropriatations to one time and engage in the--with the Eci task force to identity an ongoing progressive revenue source.,133,,
642,0.97,5981.075,5987.715,The council could cut some or all of the proposed Appropriatations in 2022.,133,,
643,0.97,5987.715,5993.42,Recognizing again that much of the 2021 Appropriatations will carry forward.,133,,
644,0.97,5993.42,6005.399,Also engage the Eci task force to identity the ongoing progressive revenue source to support the investments in 2023 and beyond or the Council could take no action.,133,,
645,0.97,6005.399,6007.968,Thank you so much.,134,,
646,0.97,6007.968,6013.54,In additional comments to the discussion we had yesterday?,134,,
647,0.97,6013.54,6014.708,Okay.,135,,
648,0.97,6014.708,6020.981,Think we were pretty robust discussion yesterday and continuation of Similarments we just shared.,135,,
649,0.97,6020.981,6029.923,Again very interested in making sure though that we recognize that some of the funding here has been spent in 2021.,135,,
650,0.97,6029.923,6036.93,I think Councilmember JA Urez described some of the crass that have been sent out the door already from the task force recommendations.,135,,
651,0.97,6036.93,6064.558,"So for me I think it would be identifying what by the end of 2021, by December of 20--December 31Th of 2021 if we can make well informed estimates about what will be spent that year, really then showing up that spent cost and 2022 so we are maintaining that $30 million investment is something I'm interested in.",135,,
652,0.97,6064.558,6066.86,I was just giving you a thumbs up.,136,,
653,0.97,6066.86,6077.104,We need it at that point in both budget and in Coronavirus work from home world.,137,,
654,0.97,6077.104,6077.504,I appreciate it.,137,,
655,0.97,6077.504,6089.216,We are trying to get a better estimate of what funds will carry forward into 2022 and which funds will be expended before the end of the year.,138,,
656,0.97,6089.216,6096.056,Even for those pieces where contracts have phone out the door it may be anticipated that contract will extend into 2022.,138,,
657,0.97,6096.056,6106.533,We are working to try it get a better estimate and will follow up.,138,,
658,0.97,6106.533,6117.311,I'm just going to step in here for--I'm just having a little bit of technical difficulties.,139,,
659,0.97,6117.311,6129.456,Checking to see whether or not there are additional comments from Councilmembers on this issue Id.,139,,
660,0.97,6129.456,6137.998,"And Amy and Allie this is the last I believe item for this issue area and the last time on the agenda, am I correct?",139,,
661,0.97,6137.998,6142.569,"We have a few more slides, not on issue Id but on.",140,,
662,0.97,6142.569,6143.67,Unthe ground.,141,,
663,0.97,6143.67,6148.675,On the budget legislation.,142,,
664,0.97,6148.675,6149.042,,143,,
665,0.97,6149.042,6149.743,Sounds great.,144,,
666,0.97,6149.743,6153.08,"Next slide please, Patty.",145,,
667,0.97,6153.08,6158.852,The final slides include information on three pieces of budget legislation which impact the Hsd budget.,146,,
668,0.97,6158.852,6166.159,There are no issues identified with these changes but I wanted to briefly highlight the changes for Council and the public.,146,,
669,0.97,6166.159,6186.88,"First the year end grant acceptance ordinance which ACCEPTS grants of almost $400,000 for vaccine access and supports 1.9 and--sorry, for vaccine access and support and 1.9 million from the Washington Department of Commerce for tiny home villages.",146,,
670,0.97,6186.88,6187.314,Next slide please.,146,,
671,0.97,6187.314,6198.025,"The second, the year in supplemental makes changes to the adopted 2021 budget including appropriating the grants discussed Previouslyn.",146,,
672,0.97,6198.025,6226.253,"Addition the Council bill corrects errors and transfers funding between departments and divisions, such as transferring eight million for rental assistance from Hsd to office of housing and transferring 4.8 million of community safety programs from youth and family empowerment to the new safe and thriving communities with I is just the--continuation of the building up of that division.",146,,
673,0.97,6226.253,6230.624,Sorry next slide as well.,146,,
674,0.97,6230.624,6252.646,"Finally the 2022 grant acceptance ACCEPTS 20.45 million in grants to support the 2022 budget including 7.7 million from the older Americans Act and 5.8 million in community development lot grants, 3.1 million for housing for persons living aids and some other smaller grants which again supports the 2022 budget.",146,,
675,0.97,6252.646,6257.784,That is all that I have for the committee today.,146,,
676,0.97,6257.784,6262.723,Unless there are any other questions.,146,,
677,0.97,6262.723,6266.36,Thank you Councilmember for stepping in.,147,,
678,0.97,6266.36,6266.76,I appreciate it.,147,,
679,0.97,6266.76,6266.927,I.,147,,
680,0.97,6266.927,6267.527,Very good.,148,,
681,0.97,6267.527,6269.796,Thank you.,149,,
682,0.97,6269.796,6271.698,Computer shut down.,150,,
683,0.97,6271.698,6271.999,Thank you.,150,,
684,0.97,6271.999,6283.01,Are there questions on these list of legislative items that go with the Hsd human services and community--safety portion?,150,,
685,0.97,6283.01,6286.279,I have two questions very briefly.,151,,
686,0.97,6286.279,6289.416,I'm looking at for a four here.,151,,
687,0.97,6289.416,6292.619,Midway through as it relates--to the funds.,151,,
688,0.97,6292.619,6310.137,"We know that from talking to folks that--on for example that there is a lot of interest in capacity building for those who are working with folks in community who have HIV, aids and want additional support and services and want capacity building.",151,,
689,0.97,6310.137,6313.106,Is there capacity building dollars associated with Hoppa?,151,,
690,0.97,6313.106,6329.99,I am not aware of capacity building specifically elm bedded in it but I'm happy to check and see if that is an eligible use for those funds.,152,,
691,0.97,6329.99,6330.357,Great.,153,,
692,0.97,6330.357,6344.938,And I appreciate that and then just generally is there anything you may point me to that has capacity building as a broad category for some of the organizations that provide human service programs?,154,,
693,0.97,6344.938,6353.78,I know that capacity building has been a big issue that's been coming up as we talk at deployment of Clipper funds for example.,154,,
694,0.97,6353.78,6355.916,Is there anything specific to capacity building?,154,,
695,0.97,6355.916,6369.396,"Do you mean specifically related to the Federal grant that are being accepted which one of them, which one of those grants will provide funds for capacity building?",155,,
696,0.97,6369.396,6369.696,Yeah.,156,,
697,0.97,6369.696,6386.179,I assume that the--the Federal dollars are probably a good place to go for capacity building if it's one time investments and that would be good to know if there is a whole category of organization that may be eligible for funding.,156,,
698,0.97,6386.179,6391.385,I'm not aware of a specific category of capacity building.,157,,
699,0.97,6391.385,6400.227,Let me work on the eligible uses of those grants to see where that would overlap with capacity building.,157,,
700,0.97,6400.227,6408.168,Again I can't think of any of those grants that have a specific line item related to capacity building.,157,,
701,0.97,6408.168,6414.474,I can--let me look into that and find some answers for and you get back to you.,157,,
702,0.97,6414.474,6414.741,Okay.,158,,
703,0.97,6414.741,6414.975,Great.,158,,
704,0.97,6414.975,6417.611,We Judgist have a quick few follow-up questions.,158,,
705,0.97,6417.611,6419.446,"Sorry, I got booted off the screen.",158,,
706,0.97,6419.446,6421.715,I don't want to interrupt anyone.,158,,
707,0.97,6421.715,6425.152,Did you have any other questions?,158,,
708,0.97,6425.152,6426.186,We look at slide nine.,158,,
709,0.97,6426.186,6436.763,We have had a number of community members who have reached out about concerns around the four million dollars for the community safety programs.,158,,
710,0.97,6436.763,6437.764,The Reentry program here.,158,,
711,0.97,6437.764,6439.866,I want to just double check.,158,,
712,0.97,6439.866,6441.268,It's transferring four million dollars.,158,,
713,0.97,6441.268,6453.847,Does that mean that four million dollars is part of our 2022 proposed budget and that the Seattle safe communities initiative is being funded in 2022 sore is not?,158,,
714,0.97,6453.847,6460.453,This reflects a change to the 2021 bump.,159,,
715,0.97,6460.453,6466.76,There was the community--the Afe communities initiative was funded one time funding.,159,,
716,0.97,6466.76,6474.334,In the--the legislation moves it from one division to another in the 2021 budget.,159,,
717,0.97,6474.334,6477.604,It was spent in 2021.,159,,
718,0.97,6477.604,6486.313,There is not another--and then there is no more funding for that in the 2023 budget which is what we had been told by CBO.,159,,
719,0.97,6486.313,6494.821,Though this is transferring that money it does not mean that is ongoing funding through 2023.,159,,
720,0.97,6494.821,6498.425,We are working to fix that.,160,,
721,0.97,6498.425,6503.697,That is--an issue that is identified for tomorrow as well.,161,,
722,0.97,6503.697,6507.267,In the--yes.,162,,
723,0.97,6507.267,6509.236,The other bucket for presentations.,162,,
724,0.97,6509.236,6510.237,Wonderful.,163,,
725,0.97,6510.237,6510.704,Thank you very much.,163,,
726,0.97,6510.704,6518.645,And then this after President afternoon I will save some of my questions on the last slide here as it relates to homeless services.,163,,
727,0.97,6518.645,6523.884,It does appear that there is at least subject--pop in for a second.,163,,
728,0.97,6523.884,6549.676,"This is reflect that the two million dollars we received from the state's Capitol budget and the 400,000 that the city set aside for operating services at those tiny homes, this is being transferred potentially to the regional homeless authority so that the creation of those tiny homes and the operation could continue in a 2022 calendar year.",163,,
729,0.97,6549.676,6550.076,Is that accurate?,163,,
730,0.97,6550.076,6555.682,We can bring this up this afternoon but I want Toma make sure that's what the two bullets reflect here.,163,,
731,0.97,6555.682,6559.085,"Are you looking at the first and third bullet, correct?",164,,
732,0.97,6559.085,6559.352,Yes.,165,,
733,0.97,6559.352,6560.42,Yeah.,166,,
734,0.97,6560.42,6561.588,That would be the case.,166,,
735,0.97,6561.588,6574.067,There has been conversations with the regional authority on homelessness to undertake the work and Hsd is going to seek to supplement it's existing contract.,166,,
736,0.97,6574.067,6581.508,That's providing a small amount of funding Ament that to the authority in this calendar year.,166,,
737,0.97,6581.508,6581.741,2021.,166,,
738,0.97,6581.741,6602.462,"The regional authority intends to prepare the Rfp on that--aware that's been discussed to add three tiny home Villanovas and just under two million dollars is the funds that were provided in the state Capitol budget in order to create new tiny home villages in see the example the $400,000 is operational funding.",166,,
739,0.97,6602.462,6616.743,It does not seem like lie that's villages would be operational in 2021 but providing the funds and allowing the authority to write and issue the Rfp will allow it to happen faster than what would have been the face otherwise.,166,,
740,0.97,6616.743,6617.11,All right.,167,,
741,0.97,6617.11,6617.41,Thank you.,167,,
742,0.97,6617.41,6627.754,I think the preview of some of the web to Untangle this afternoon was he talk about homeless service investments and great memo again by Jeff to come.,167,,
743,0.97,6627.754,6642.235,I have one more question for you on your great Mmemo and Councilmember Herbold you may have spoken to this and leading--on the sexual assault surveyor's Invertments.,167,,
744,0.97,6642.235,6651.611,We did hear public testimony about concern about the sexual assault survivors outreach efforts not being included in the budget.,167,,
745,0.97,6651.611,6664.658,I want to make sure when I'm looking here on page 2 of the memo you can clarify what is or is not included in the budget as it relates to sexual assault survivor program services and outreach?,167,,
746,0.97,6664.658,6665.258,Absolutely.,168,,
747,0.97,6665.258,6666.926,"So, in the proposed budget.",168,,
748,0.97,6666.926,6677.971,"There is an increase of two Ffe's that would be added for victims Advocat, S who provide services for Surveyors of gender based violence.",168,,
749,0.97,6677.971,6687.714,I mentioned at the beginning there are some areas where Hsd does direct service.,168,,
750,0.97,6687.714,6699.192,That brings the total number of applications to 14.,168,,
751,0.97,6699.192,6708.435,It provides funding for domestic assault services for organization that serve the American Indian and the Alaska native community.,168,,
752,0.97,6708.435,6718.111,I Negligenced the money for that specific community.,168,,
753,0.97,6718.111,6720.146,"There are $875,000 for general fund.",168,,
754,0.97,6720.146,6737.664,I want to be clear that the funding replaces declining revenues from the sex Fund so this fund will allow the Department to maintain current levels of--the programs or the contracts.,168,,
755,0.97,6737.664,6751.044,That is what is in the 2022 proposed budget related to the topic.,168,,
756,0.97,6751.044,6751.411,Thank you.,169,,
757,0.97,6751.411,6762.689,Are you doing such a wonderful job of giving me a platform to talk about some of my budget priorities.,170,,
758,0.97,6762.689,6763.189,Really appreciate that.,170,,
759,0.97,6763.189,6793.653,"One issue is you rightly NOTE and we heard in public testimony is that providers in the region are identifying the fact that our state recognized domestic violence housing found that mobile model for domestic and sexual violence services promoting long term stability, safety and well being for survivors and children.",170,,
760,0.97,6793.653,6802.262,"It's a flexible model and particularly suited to serving smaller, specific by and for providers.",170,,
761,0.97,6802.262,6810.103,"Register recognize that so many our providers are black, and people of color led organizations.",170,,
762,0.97,6810.103,6825.919,This proposal will--if supported by the Council will allow them to add capacity and provide housing and other forms of assistance without requiring significant Capitol.,170,,
763,0.97,6825.919,6826.219,Thank you.,170,,

772,0.97,6863.856,6879.973,Some of the priorities that are in Hsd we will be discussing tomorrow as part of the community safety presentation.,174,,
773,0.97,6879.973,6900.326,Some additional needs include supporting the Seattle human services coalition number one priority for a wage [inaudible] study and I think I have talked or my staff have talked to a few of you about that.,174,,
774,0.97,6900.326,6908.601,Also interested in supporting the--let's see what is it called?,174,,
775,0.97,6908.601,6910.67,The East African senior center.,174,,
776,0.97,6910.67,6916.509,It's out of the area--the air agency on aging.,174,,
777,0.97,6916.509,6927.353,They have a vision for developing a more robust senior center program for Republican around services and programs.,174,,
778,0.97,6927.353,6937.664,Members of the East African comment engage with a meal program that's sound generation operates two days a week.,174,,
779,0.97,6937.664,6947.206,"The programs operate in partnership with the Seattle parks and Rec and parks support expanding, the program.",174,,
780,0.97,6947.206,6954.147,"But, funding is really needed for staff.",174,,
781,0.97,6954.147,6969.295,The program model could be similar to the successful model by the Lake--I'm hoping I'm checking a lot of boxes for Councilmember JA Urez.,174,,
782,0.97,6969.295,6982.575,It's another high priority investment that I'm hoping to get support on.,174,,
783,0.97,6982.575,6994.587,And--I think--you know again the--the many of the Hsd ones will be talking about more tomorrow.,174,,

785,0.97,6997.09,7003.796,I'm not seeing any additional hands at this point.,175,,
786,0.97,7003.796,7011.571,I appreciate all the time you provided for us as Councilmembers have said.,175,,
787,0.97,7011.571,7013.339,Toker this goes to so many other areas.,175,,
788,0.97,7013.339,7041.267,"Making sure we are investing in the human infrastructure as discussed in the--is incredibly important to make sure we sustain our families, Amendmenters, kids in this time of crisis and we can emerge from this more equal and with greater opportunities and I look forward to working with all of you to sort of plug some of these holes and right some of these ships if there is a difference of opinion on how we should be using various fund sources.",175,,
789,0.97,7041.267,7052.678,We know there is a lot of interest out there in making sure that funding gets out the door and deployed quickly.,175,,
790,0.97,7052.678,7063.756,I appreciate that you said you will come back and--how the past funds have been used.,175,,
791,0.97,7063.756,7079.105,I'm concerned the supportive service for older adults category we funded to the tune of $7.7 million hasn't been spent at all yet and looking forward to figuring out how we can get the dollars out the door.,175,,
792,0.97,7079.105,7085.812,When people are suffering as we funded in June and early July.,175,,
793,0.97,7085.812,7090.983,Last word on this?,175,,
794,0.97,7090.983,7137.096,"For funding priorities that are in the Mayor's budget, that potentially a particular Councilmember really doesn't want to see get cut but that funding--that area is funded with payroll tax perhaps not appropriately or not consistent with the Council spending plan, are you looking for Councilmembers to propose a CBA to facilitate that slot or is that--is that a function that you as--budget chair are going to be sort of leading?",176,,
795,0.97,7137.096,7163.856,I'm speaking specifically right now of one call which I'm--I really want to make sure we keep funding in the budget for but recognize that the gunning source may not be an appropriate funding source and wondering to I--do I need to propose a budget action or are you kind of doing that sort of Holistically for all the things that aren't funded correctly?,176,,
796,0.97,7163.856,7165.958,Thank you for asking that.,177,,
797,0.97,7165.958,7169.462,I know that's probably a question others have as well.,177,,
798,0.97,7169.462,7177.503,Ly do my best to answer you from my office and all arc E can talk about the technical aspects central staff.,177,,
799,0.97,7177.503,7187.246,"I will becoming many to you all with a OMMN Ib us corrective package, amendment to try to right those fund streams.",177,,
800,0.97,7187.246,7199.725,"That example you that just raced the call services is one of--for example the four bullet that were in the issue fact memo yesterday where we said these are all, you know potentially really important things.",177,,
801,0.97,7199.725,7213.639,They have been in my perspective used--they have been funded by a source that has not been directed for that purpose and then in that--take away the funding for what jump start had been intended to fund.,177,,
802,0.97,7213.639,7230.656,"Ly come up with an amendment that allows for us to do a different source of funding for items such as that so you don't have to do one for each specific item and I do know there may be other items where folks would say I'm not interested in the funding at this level, maybe this level.",177,,
803,0.97,7230.656,7232.391,That will be a separate conversation.,177,,
804,0.97,7232.391,7233.492,I will work on a large piece.,177,,
805,0.97,7233.492,7234.794,Anything to add to that?,177,,
806,0.97,7234.794,7235.895,Thank you.,178,,
807,0.97,7235.895,7248.307,The only Thingly add is we will be working as the chair explained with the chair to do that package and try to better align the spending with the fund policies.,179,,
808,0.97,7248.307,7270.162,The issue that we were sort of raising yesterday is finding an ongoing source of funds for those expenses that are proposed to be either directly supported from the jump start fund and/or are benefiting the increased amount of jump start fund money that were into the general fund.,179,,
809,0.97,7270.162,7294.587,"Its going to be a problem or put another way, it is likely that if we are able to achieve this a lot of it'll be one time funds for those expenses and this is getting at the issue around our general fund expenses for base services or expanded services in these areas is right now out pacing you general fund revenue projections.",179,,
810,0.97,7294.587,7308.467,While W will work to do take it'll likely be a one time fix which means that absent sort of a cut to another ongoing service or new revenue source next year we would not be able to do this.,179,,
811,0.97,7308.467,7314.14,So that is sort of you heard the director say in his presentation it works this year.,179,,
812,0.97,7314.14,7316.409,It doesn't work next year.,179,,
813,0.97,7316.409,7328.854,That is likely the case unless there significant other cuts to other city services and/or we identity new revenues or General fund revenues increase significantly.,179,,
814,0.97,7328.854,7340.032,There is a lot of different ways this can play out but I want to flag that as the question of Sustainability is coming to a head here.,179,,
815,0.97,7340.032,7344.437,Thank you for that.,180,,
816,0.97,7344.437,7344.97,Appreciate the question.,180,,
817,0.97,7344.97,7359.719,"I also, you know want to hear from you all as we go through this if there are items you that see in the issue fact memos where there may be an area for us to reduce the amount of funding or shift priorities to something else.",180,,
818,0.97,7359.719,7366.792,You see those of course let central staff know that as well as at digs are you thinking of that will be helpful.,180,,
819,0.97,7366.792,7381.34,"With that, Amy, I'm not seeing an additional hands and look forward to the afternoon discussion to carry forward on human services specific to the investments in homeless service responses.",180,,
820,0.97,7381.34,7385.678,We will have a full afternoon to discuss that.,180,,
821,0.97,7385.678,7394.32,Not seeing any objections so colleagues if there are no objection we will have an extra long recess today and we will go and reconvene at 2:00 P.M.,180,,
