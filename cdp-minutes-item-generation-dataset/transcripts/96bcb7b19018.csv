300,0.8583285808563232,1676.5,1678.9, Greater concern was lack of accessibility.,,,
301,0.8583285808563232,1679.2,1684.7,"One of our learnings was that, the technology of the online application portal was very easy for families with means.",,,
302,0.8583285808563232,1684.9,1695.8,"However, the portal could be a barrier in accessing our spp application through deal, and many spp preschool agencies were able to enroll families face to face circumventing this hurdle.",,,
303,0.8583285808563232,1696.2,1699.5,"So, deal has more work to do in improving access to spp.",,,

314,0.8833561539649963,1759.7,1767.9,"If they've got questions as well, I wanted to start where was I starting?",,,

316,0.8833561539649963,1775.8,1777.8,Can you share with us?,,,
317,0.9128386974334717,1779.1,1781.4," What, how many or what?",,,

320,0.7768786549568176,1788.9,1794.1,So currently are one of our best metrics for that question.,,,
321,0.7768786549568176,1794.1,1804.7,"Dance, that question is the number of students who are on the mckinney-vento list, so that is one sort of source of enumerating that count.",,,
322,0.7768786549568176,1804.9,1807.4,So that currently is about 1800.,,,
323,0.7768786549568176,1808.2,1812.9,So that's a number that Seattle Public Schools tracks and updates pretty regularly.,,,
324,0.7768786549568176,1812.9,1816.1,So right now it's currently 1801 thing.,,,
325,0.7768786549568176,1816.1,1816.4,I'd want to,,,
326,0.743194580078125,1816.6,1821.8," No, it is that this investment by Design is meant to serve any student.",,,
327,0.743194580078125,1821.8,1827.9,"Who is either, you know, obviously literally homeless, or either unstable, be housed.",,,
328,0.743194580078125,1827.9,1842.8,"So potentially students who are not eligible to be on the mckinney-vento official list but are facing the threat of eviction or losing their home or or needing to, you know, find more stable housing.",,,
329,0.743194580078125,1842.8,1844.5,These students can also be served as well.,,,
330,0.743194580078125,1844.5,1846.3,"So, the official Nikki",,,

332,0.8296640515327454,1854.6,1855.5, Did you want to say something?,,,
333,0.8296640515327454,1856.1,1857.1,"So, thank you.",,,
334,0.8296640515327454,1857.7,1861.1,"So, can you talk a little bit about?",,,
335,0.8296640515327454,1861.1,1865.2,"I mean, obviously, deal is providing programs support.",,,
336,0.8296640515327454,1865.2,1874.6,"You're not in the school's necessarily, but can you talk a little bit about how this city works with the school district to make sure that students aren't?",,,
337,0.8296640515327454,1875.3,1883.0,We're aware of the students who need that support and the different organizations that are involved in kind of tracking those students to make sure they get the services that they need.,,,
338,0.9020968079566956,1884.1,1884.3, Yeah.,,,
339,0.9020968079566956,1884.3,1885.0,Absolutely.,,,
340,0.9020968079566956,1885.0,1896.4,So our current model in this is this is a relatively new area for deal with the 2018 fat Webby the the model is built on a essentially like a referral system.,,,
341,0.9020968079566956,1896.4,1908.4,So deal contracts with an HHS provider to provide these services for families who are who are go to be screened and ultimately enrolled in these HHS services.,,,
342,0.9020968079566956,1908.4,1913.1,But this work really is dependent on deals or,,,
343,0.7503877282142639,1913.2,1925.3," Ship with Seattle public schools and likewise be able to connect, and facilitate collaboration between Seattle public schools and the HHS provider since Seattle public.",,,
344,0.7503877282142639,1925.3,1934.1,"Since the school district are uniquely positioned to identify, and sort of know, our students in crisis, are they nearing housing crisis?",,,
345,0.7503877282142639,1934.9,1936.9,We have this referral model setup.,,,
346,0.7503877282142639,1937.0,1943.0,That school staff are empowered in equipped to be able to refer those seamless.,,,
347,0.8495060205459595,1943.1,1947.7, For a immediate or urgent screening with one of our HHS provider.,,,
348,0.8495060205459595,1947.7,1951.3,So the general model is school.,,,
349,0.8495060205459595,1951.3,1962.7,Stop have that sort of vantage point to be able to identify who these students are in the city in Deal sets up sort of conduits for those referrals.,,,
350,0.8495060205459595,1962.9,1966.6,"So those families can be immediately assess and provide services,",,,
351,0.8989856243133545,1968.3,1975.1," So the list of stakeholders that you have on slide 11, are those some of the providers that you're talking about them?",,,
352,0.8989856243133545,1975.9,1982.2,"Actually, these are stakeholders that were represented on our racial Equity toolkit team for this investment.",,,
353,0.8989856243133545,1982.2,1989.1,So those are some of the organizations that were represented and were able to take a look at the investment.,,,
354,0.8989856243133545,1989.1,1995.1,The providers that we that are have been selected for this investment.,,,
355,0.8989856243133545,1995.1,1997.0,In our first iteration of this,,,
356,0.70738285779953,1997.1,1997.5, Investment.,,,
357,0.70738285779953,1997.5,2005.6,It was the YWCA and we actually just recently rebid this investment and we have two new providers coming online.,,,
358,0.70738285779953,2006.7,2011.9,"This school year, the first thing that boys and girls club and the second being Neighborhood House.",,,
359,0.9128385186195374,2016.3,2017.3," Okay, thank you.",,,
360,0.9128385186195374,2017.7,2021.1,Can you as you're talking about?,,,
361,0.9128382802009583,2022.8,2037.5," As you're talking about the burdens of this process and the things that you have done to try to address accessibility, I am thinking about the fact that we just saw think in today's or yesterday's paper evictions are going up.",,,
362,0.9128382802009583,2037.8,2044.6,"You know, the moratoriums that we have implemented in different places are starting to expire",,,
363,0.8336586356163025,2047.3,2049.8," And we expect that, that will lead to increased homelessness.",,,
364,0.8336586356163025,2049.8,2062.0,"So can you talk a little bit about how, you know, anticipating that that might happen that there might be more students who need Services, how deal and how these programs might be able to expand to support that.",,,
365,0.7925719022750854,2064.2,2065.0," Yeah, that's it.",,,
366,0.7925719022750854,2065.0,2067.8,That's a very timely question.,,,
367,0.7925719022750854,2067.8,2085.7,And I definitely appreciate our red team for throughout their analysis for identifying that the eviction moratorium was obviously helping a lot of students from preventing them from falling into housing crisis.,,,
368,0.7925719022750854,2086.3,2092.9,It was also having this sort of unintended or sort of the strange Quark of maybe,,,
369,0.8064572811126709,2093.1,2097.5, Writing to an undercount of how many scenes were actually at risk.,,,
370,0.8064572811126709,2097.7,2101.1,"Once we're would be a risk, once eviction moratorium was lifted.",,,
371,0.8064572811126709,2101.8,2109.5,And so thanks to some of the suggestions that came from from Nick and his fellow red team members.,,,
372,0.8064572811126709,2110.2,2122.3,"We have a sort of trying to preemptively, enhance the programs so that students were just removing barriers for students to be able to access these Investments.",,,
373,0.8892682790756226,2123.0,2137.2," We moved from a single provider to multiple providers just to be able to extend that reach and extend that quick response and we're also adapting some of our, our program guidelines for our providers.",,,
374,0.8892682790756226,2137.2,2142.4,"In terms of emergency assistance funding, how long students can be enrolled.",,,
375,0.8892682790756226,2143.1,2150.0,"And so, there's, we're taking sort of a multi-pronged approach to get ahead of what we're expecting to see.",,,
376,0.8892682790756226,2150.7,2152.9,And we'll already are seeing as a result of,,,
377,0.8066552877426147,2153.0,2154.9, Vic's moratorium being lifted.,,,
378,0.8066552877426147,2155.7,2169.1,"I'd like to also add that, you know what you what Vic is also saying, is our intent here was to have this investment, basically, cast The Net, far and wide and provide flexibility.",,,
379,0.8066552877426147,2169.1,2176.1,Because what we identified is this is a holistic issue and and being an early learning provider.,,,
380,0.8066552877426147,2176.1,2182.6,"I'm not necessarily beholden to Seattle Public Schools, but we do have a connection to them, especially as a",,,
381,0.8999963402748108,2183.0,2194.3," Of organization where we have native intake reps and so if we can streamline here's what a child and family is going through and pass that information continuity of services is smooth, right?",,,
382,0.8999963402748108,2194.3,2206.8,And we can continue that and there's no hiccups for families to just to restart the process and will bomb with the flexibility of funding that we identified in this HHS investment it.,,,
383,0.8999963402748108,2206.8,2211.2,"You know, if a family has to prioritize Transportation food and rent.",,,
384,0.8999963402748108,2211.2,2213.0,Like they're gonna,,,
385,0.8671842813491821,2213.0,2214.6, Have to make some hard choices.,,,
386,0.8671842813491821,2214.7,2223.8,"So if we can expand this and make it more flexible to holistically sort of the child and families, then it's really alleviating some of these stressors off of them.",,,
387,0.8671842813491821,2224.7,2225.6,"Yeah, absolutely.",,,
388,0.8671842813491821,2225.6,2238.7,"And we all know that especially if families are in poverty, there's a lot of support that's needed and that's and if we would just Center the needs of the kids and make sure that they're doing well, all that other stuff would follow so.",,,
389,0.8671842813491821,2239.2,2242.8,"Okay, one last question.",,,
390,0.9128382205963135,2242.9,2252.8," Ian, it sounded like a theme through some of these issues was accessibility was a barrier, whether its technology or language access.",,,
391,0.9128382205963135,2252.8,2255.8,So can you talk a little bit about particularly?,,,
392,0.9128382205963135,2255.8,2272.5,"I know, when we had the the loving committee meeting in June, you know, a lot of the data that was presented indicated, that Latino families were or two students were",,,
393,0.8517018556594849,2273.4,2276.1, Not keeping Pace with the achievement that we would like to see.,,,
394,0.8517018556594849,2276.1,2280.3,And I'm wondering if part of it is the lack of access language access.,,,
395,0.8517018556594849,2280.3,2289.3,So can you talk a little bit about how you are addressing the language access needs so that folks can understand the programs that are available to them?,,,
396,0.8615949153900146,2295.2,2300.4," great question, what I can tell you is",,,
397,0.7717732787132263,2301.5,2306.3, It just this is a clarifying point is your question specifically to the FCC mentorship program?,,,
398,0.7717732787132263,2306.3,2309.0,Are you wanting to know sort of like in general?,,,
399,0.7717732787132263,2309.7,2311.2,Well yeah so that was a broad question.,,,
400,0.7717732787132263,2311.7,2329.7,"So there are a couple places in this presentation, where you identify language access as a barrier, whether it's to the spp selection and enrollment process or forget what there was another place earlier, where you mentioned just like increasing awareness and part of the issue being language access.",,,
401,0.7717732787132263,2329.7,2331.1,So we happy to answer,,,
402,0.7356281280517578,2332.3,2342.4, So we're definitely aware of that in developing ways to provide interpretation translation of materials.,,,
403,0.7356281280517578,2342.8,2361.1,And another exciting thing that I like to just tell you a little bit about I'd be happy to provide you with more information later but we are a few years into a dual language initiative which is providing our Seattle dual language programs with training and professional development.,,,
404,0.7901769280433655,2361.2,2373.1, Meantime on how to strengthen and increase the amount of language supports that we can provide and educational experiences that we can provide and many languages.,,,
405,0.7901769280433655,2373.4,2388.2,We also provide open that to professional development up to all of the RSVP teachers as well and we look forward to continuing to expand the programming in 2027.,,,
406,0.7901769280433655,2389.0,2391.1,I mean like I said it's a big project.,,,
407,0.837799608707428,2391.4,2399.1," And my colleagues know me, I could go on and on talking about it but I would be happy to provide you with some more information as far as how we how we do that.",,,
408,0.837799608707428,2401.7,2407.3,"Let's see, I will open it up if my colleagues have questions.",,,
409,0.837799608707428,2408.3,2409.3,Do I see a hand?,,,
410,0.837799608707428,2409.3,2410.4,"Yes, councilmember Nelson.",,,

412,0.864518940448761,2415.5,2427.5,"So the conclusion in this, reiterate your point, but you just said that there are 18 students on the list and the conclusion says that to date the number of families.",,,
413,0.864518940448761,2427.5,2431.5,Served by these investments in the homelessness and housing support services.,,,
414,0.864518940448761,2431.9,2438.6,Do not it correlate with the scale of investment because of the access issues that you just described and this is just one.,,,
415,0.864518940448761,2440.1,2441.6,So I support those,,,
416,0.9128385782241821,2442.0,2446.5, Conditions for getting people into this into these services.,,,
417,0.9128385782241821,2448.2,2454.1,"And perhaps this is a question for the next presentation, but I am",,,
418,0.7507073879241943,2455.7,2465.0, Interested in making sure that families that qualify for our preschool services in general are actually accessing them too.,,,
419,0.7507073879241943,2465.0,2476.7,"And so because in the original it when this was started in the beginning, one of the updates, the one of the first updates was talking about the lack of preschool teachers.",,,
420,0.7507073879241943,2477.4,2485.3,"And so now, I want to make sure that you do you have enough preschool teachers and we have and we have kids",,,
421,0.8816670775413513,2485.5,2487.2, That are in classrooms.,,,
422,0.8816670775413513,2487.2,2495.6,So anyway I'm sorry to bleed over into the next one but for this I'm assuming that the services are available.,,,
423,0.8816670775413513,2495.6,2500.3,It's just a matter of Act of Outreach and getting the families enrolled.,,,
424,0.8587541580200195,2502.4,2507.2, Is that from the homelessness and housing Support Services standpoint?,,,
425,0.8587541580200195,2507.2,2507.7,Yes.,,,
426,0.8587541580200195,2507.7,2509.6,So that resources are there.,,,
427,0.8587541580200195,2510.6,2516.2,We learned a lot in this first iteration of this investment and we learned a lot.,,,
428,0.8587541580200195,2516.2,2531.8,"Thanks to the red team identifying like, for example, like the in language access issues that we think are providing like an undue barrier to access for our, for our students, to be able to take advantage of these resources and Investments that are there.",,,
429,0.8587541580200195,2531.8,2532.0,"So,",,,

492,0.9128384590148926,2921.1,2924.0,This amendment occurs on page 77.,,,
493,0.9128384590148926,2924.1,2930.5,And this is one of the recommendations from the toolkit that we would like to put into practice next slide.,,,
494,0.9128384590148926,2931.5,2934.5,So some quick analysis on this amendment.,,,
495,0.9128384590148926,2934.9,2938.1,We know that students who are experiencing housing.,,,
496,0.9128384590148926,2938.1,2940.3,Instability have a lot of other pressures that,,,
497,0.9001280069351196,2940.4,2945.3, Can lead to their feeling disconnected to their school communities or unable to engage in activities.,,,
498,0.9001280069351196,2945.3,2955.9,So this amendment will allow for that Levy funds to also support other basic needs related to clothing nutrition or Transportation.,,,
499,0.9001280069351196,2955.9,2970.4,"Our intent is that these These funds will still prioritize keeping students housed, but our community providers will have flexibility to support other student needs, so those kids can stay connected.",,,
500,0.912838339805603,2970.4,2976.7," Acted to their schools, this investment primarily benefit students of color in our schools.",,,
501,0.912838339805603,2977.0,2978.9,We are not proposing.,,,
502,0.912838339805603,2978.9,2980.4,Any budget changes.,,,
503,0.912838339805603,2980.4,2982.0,As a result of this amendment.,,,
504,0.912838339805603,2982.8,2986.3,We do not expect to increase the number of families served.,,,
505,0.912838339805603,2986.3,2988.0,We intend to serve them better.,,,
506,0.9128385782241821,2990.5,2991.2, Next slide.,,,
507,0.8313000798225403,2993.2,2999.3," So the Seattle preschool program as you know, is a universal access program.",,,
508,0.8313000798225403,2999.3,3006.5,We offer free tuition for income qualifying families and other families pay tuition on a sliding scale.,,,
509,0.8313000798225403,3006.9,3022.9,The implementation plan adopted in 2019 set that threshold for paying tuition at 350 percent of the federal poverty level in 2021 when the Washington State Legislature passed.,,,
510,0.8483297824859619,3023.1,3030.1," Fair starts for kids act, they change their metric for the state childcare program to State, median income.",,,
511,0.8483297824859619,3030.4,3038.5,And so this amendment allows deal to align our city program metrics for calculating tuition to the state.,,,
512,0.8483297824859619,3038.6,3040.4,So these changes are made on pages.,,,
513,0.8483297824859619,3040.4,3046.5,7 32 and 122 of the plan next slide.,,,
514,0.7999280095100403,3048.5,3060.7," So just some quick analysis from us, we looked to identify the equivalence of 350 FPL and we have noted that as 94% state median income.",,,
515,0.7999280095100403,3061.8,3069.7,"We project a five percent reduction in Revenue as a result of this change in that equates to roughly 1,000 dollars annually.",,,
516,0.7999280095100403,3069.7,3074.1,So not a significant budget impact to deal next slide.,,,
517,0.8807125687599182,3075.5,3079.7," And we did actually use State median income, those past school year.",,,
518,0.8807125687599182,3079.7,3088.1,And what this data shows you is that there was not a change in access to free tuition for families of color as a result of this change.,,,
519,0.8807125687599182,3088.1,3097.4,"So again, a fairly budget-neutral change and, you know, a neutral impact to families as it relates to free tuition access.",,,
520,0.9128385782241821,3099.4,3100.1, Next slide.,,,
521,0.9019549489021301,3102.3,3104.5," The third Early Learning, I'm sorry.",,,
522,0.9019549489021301,3104.5,3109.5,"The third amendment relates to early enrollment in the Seattle, preschool program.",,,
523,0.9019549489021301,3109.5,3110.7,This is another amendment.,,,
524,0.9019549489021301,3110.7,3114.8,That brings us into alignment with state and federal policies.,,,
525,0.9019549489021301,3114.8,3126.0,"So, currently, the implementation plan on page 32 says that children need to be three years old by August 31st in order to enroll in the preschool program.",,,
526,0.9019549489021301,3126.4,3131.8,"So, this amendment allows students to enroll after August 31st,",,,
527,0.8914784789085388,3132.1,3157.0," On their third birthday and two instances that is for students with individualized, education plans, IEPs, or or who are receiving special education services and her children enrolled in the federally funded head start preschool program or the state-funded preschool program which is called early childhood education and assistance program, or ecap.",,,
528,0.8914784789085388,3157.6,3159.6,I'll talk briefly about each of those,,,
529,0.7223119139671326,3161.8,3165.1, Situations next so next slide.,,,
530,0.7223119139671326,3166.1,3167.9,"Alright, children with IEPs.",,,
531,0.7223119139671326,3167.9,3176.1,So this amendment applies only to enrollment in the spp plus program which is administered by Seattle Public Schools.,,,
532,0.7223119139671326,3176.6,3184.3,So this brings us into alignment with Federal policies related to the IDE a act.,,,
533,0.7223119139671326,3184.3,3191.5,"So currently a child with special needs, when they turn three years old, they have access to developmental preschool",,,
534,0.8191117644309998,3191.7,3198.0," Administered by Seattle Public Schools, this amendment will allow them to also access SP p +.",,,
535,0.8191117644309998,3198.4,3206.5,So some differences between those programs developmental preschool is around 10 hours a week of services.,,,
536,0.8191117644309998,3206.8,3211.8,Whereas s PP plus is 30 hours a week of services.,,,
537,0.8191117644309998,3212.0,3220.6,SB P plus is also an inclusion model which means students with special needs learn alongside other peers who may not have those needs.,,,
538,0.8191117644309998,3221.2,3221.5,There's,,,
539,0.8737123012542725,3221.6,3244.4," A lot of research supporting inclusion models, and Seattle is really proud to offer that the data here shows you current demographics of students in spp plus, and I do want to note that our Levy oversight committee asked us to monitor demographics, to ensure there's not any over-representation of students of color in this.",,,
540,0.8737123012542725,3244.4,3248.9,"In this program, where's the can I ask how that?",,,
541,0.8737123012542725,3248.9,3251.3,So there's 32 students with IEPs,,,
542,0.777048647403717,3251.6,3254.3," In the program, but where is the program?",,,
543,0.777048647403717,3254.6,3259.2,"So what are so SP p +, as I mentioned is administered by Seattle Public Schools.",,,
544,0.777048647403717,3259.6,3267.8,So my understanding and we can follow up to confirm is that the vast majority of these classrooms are in SPS buildings administered.,,,
545,0.777048647403717,3267.8,3273.7,"By SPS teachers, I believe there are two classrooms administered by Community Partners.",,,
546,0.777048647403717,3274.6,3277.0,"I believe, one is University of Washington?",,,
547,0.777048647403717,3277.0,3277.3,Yep.,,,
548,0.777048647403717,3277.8,3279.5,And I'm hearing and deaf School.,,,
549,0.8525797724723816,3280.8,3288.1," So I guess my question is, if I have a preschooler who has an IEP, do I have to take them to the EU at u-dub?",,,
550,0.8525797724723816,3288.1,3293.5,Or is there some place in my local neighborhood school that has?,,,
551,0.8525797724723816,3293.5,3302.7,So every neighborhood school had that has an SP program is also SP P. Plus I don't know if that's true but we have all about and let's do a nose.,,,
552,0.8525797724723816,3302.8,3303.7,"Yeah, I wouldn't say that.",,,
553,0.8525797724723816,3303.7,3310.0,"Every school in a local in your neighborhood, has the spp plus classroom, but we do have SP people.",,,
554,0.9128385186195374,3310.2,3312.7," Classrooms, you know, throughout the city.",,,
555,0.9128385186195374,3312.7,3318.9,"So, but I wouldn't qualify it as every school, but we can get you a list of exact schools that have that pp+ classes.",,,
556,0.9128385186195374,3319.6,3326.1,"I'm asking, because I actually had a preschooler with an IEP and there was at that time, he's 22.",,,
557,0.9128385186195374,3326.1,3335.1,"Now, it was hard to find a preschool that could support his needs, and we ended up taking him to EU, right?",,,
558,0.9128385186195374,3336.1,3340.0,"And if there was something available,",,,
559,0.7849858403205872,3340.1,3346.9, All in my neighborhood that certainly would have been much easier logistically to deal with and I'm just wondering as a parent.,,,
560,0.7849858403205872,3346.9,3350.5,How do I know how do I find that support?,,,
561,0.7849858403205872,3350.5,3355.3,"If it's something that I realize I need and I wouldn't imagine that every school had it, right?",,,
562,0.7849858403205872,3355.3,3367.6,"Because it is specialized, but my guess is that more than 32 student preschool age students in this city could benefit from not?",,,
563,0.7849858403205872,3367.6,3370.0,"So I'm just trying to figure out like, what is the actual need?",,,
564,0.8802978992462158,3370.2,3377.9," What is the, what is the demand, what is our capacity and how do we let people know what we do have and whether we need to expand it.",,,
565,0.8802978992462158,3379.2,3380.1,So I do.,,,
566,0.8802978992462158,3380.2,3385.5,But do everything that you submit just mentioned is something that myself and the are amazing Early Learning.,,,
