381,0.97,2086.884,2092.957,"Usually when we do the commissions, it takes like an hour and a half when we are out in chambers.",72,,
382,0.97,2092.957,2095.493,So it is kind of awkward to try to catch up with the titles.,72,,
383,0.97,2095.493,2096.994,"But we got that done, so thank you.",72,,
384,0.97,2096.994,2104.335,Let's move on and our agenda to the signing of letters and proclamations.,72,,

394,0.97,2134.732,2152.717,"If you are wondering why it is called that, it was created after the Italian Supreme Court overturned an assault conviction because justices felt that since the victim was wearing tight jeans, she must have helped the remove the jeans.",73,,

447,0.97,2301.399,2302.033,Thank you so much.,111,,
448,0.97,2302.033,2306.837,This letter calls on the United States Senate to pass the safe banking act.,111,,
449,0.97,2306.837,2324.955,The safe banking Act will allow access to normal banking services and shift away from the cash only model that they are currently forced to use under antiquated Federal laws.,111,,
450,0.97,2324.955,2328.259,Cannabis business cash only makes them targets for theft in ages the life of workers.,111,,
451,0.97,2328.259,2340.538,In the state's three--I am missing my point.,111,,
452,0.97,2340.538,2349.18,"We know there have been multiple local robberies of Cannabis stores, including deaths of Cannabis store employees.",111,,
453,0.97,2349.18,2358.255,There have been more robberies in Cannabis stores so far in 2022 than in both 2020 and 2021 combined.,111,,
454,0.97,2358.255,2362.827,The most recent just a couple of days ago at Skyway.,111,,
455,0.97,2362.827,2367.832,In addition to three Cannabis store employees who were murdered last month.,111,,
456,0.97,2367.832,2374.905,I want to thank Mayor Bruce Harrell for cosigning the letter.,111,,
457,0.97,2374.905,2381.412,"This past February, the House added the safe banking act as part of the America competes act.",111,,
458,0.97,2381.412,2386.517,"However, the Senate version of the competes act does not include the safe banking act.",111,,
459,0.97,2386.517,2400.398,And so this letter calls on senators to include the safe banking act as part of the final competes act that goes to President Biden's desk.,111,,
460,0.97,2400.398,2415.579,"And so, again, this particular letter will go to the conference committee who is making the decision about whether or not to add the faith act.",111,,
461,0.97,2415.579,2415.88,Thank you.,111,,
462,0.97,2415.88,2420.451,"Councilmember Herbold, I have a couple of questions I want to ask you.",112,,
463,0.97,2420.451,2422.453,I agree with your letter.,112,,
464,0.97,2422.453,2427.124,Obviously we have been following the safe baking act for Cannabis stores to have access to banking obviously.,112,,
465,0.97,2427.124,2435.9,So was it Senator Cantwell or Murray recently that was promoting it in the news?,112,,
466,0.97,2435.9,2439.77,"My understanding is, everybody from our delegation is supportive of this.",113,,
467,0.97,2439.77,2448.946,"The letter, as it is focus now, is really about the process.",113,,
468,0.97,2448.946,2467.231,"And adding a legislative proposal that our and tire allegations supports, but adding it to be included as part of the Federal competes act because otherwise, it won't get heard.",113,,
469,0.97,2467.231,2468.365,It has failed.,114,,
470,0.97,2468.365,2471.769,It has gone through the House twice and failed in the Senate.,114,,
471,0.97,2471.769,2475.039,That is why we are making another run at it.,114,,
472,0.97,2475.039,2475.673,Okay.,114,,
473,0.97,2475.673,2476.507,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",114,,
474,0.97,2476.507,2477.575,And thank you for doing this.,114,,
475,0.97,2477.575,2484.315,This is been an issue for me way back in the day when yours truly use to own Hemp stores.,114,,
476,0.97,2484.315,2489.186,That is another story.,114,,
477,0.97,2489.186,2490.688,I had no idea.,115,,
478,0.97,2490.688,2493.157,You would be surprised what I used to do 30 years ago.,116,,
479,0.97,2493.157,2494.358,Thank God there was not social media then.,116,,
480,0.97,2494.358,2501.599,Does anyone else have anything to say about counsel Herbold's letter?,116,,
481,0.97,2501.599,2511.609,"Not seeing any, Madame Clark, will you please call role on Councilmember Herbold's letter.",116,,
482,0.97,2511.609,2512.209,Councilmember Mosqueda.,117,,

499,0.97,2534.098,2556.153,"Moving on to the agenda, let's hear from our colleagues on the preview of city council actions, counsel and regional committees and the role call this week, the Rotational start with Councilmember Mosqueda, Councilmember Nelson, Peterson, Strauss, Herbold, Lewis and myself.",131,,
500,0.97,2556.153,2557.021,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you are first.",131,,
501,0.97,2557.021,2565.129,Good afternoon everyone.,132,,
502,0.97,2565.129,2565.996,Thank you Council President.,132,,
503,0.97,2565.996,2572.87,The next Finance and housing committee meeting that we have will be on May 4TH at 9:30 A.M.,132,,
504,0.97,2572.87,2577.675,"We will have the office of housing, staffing legislation for discussion and possible vote.",132,,
505,0.97,2577.675,2581.645,We will have a briefing on the general fund balance analysis.,132,,
506,0.97,2581.645,2583.847,This is the six-year financial plan.,132,,
507,0.97,2583.847,2594.825,"And a briefing on the Seattle rescue plan quarterly updates for folks following along and are members of the financial housing Committee, we did not get a chance to get to the spending quarterly update.",132,,
508,0.97,2594.825,2603.701,That is what we will start with at the next meeting and then we have the Much-Anticipated Six- year financial plan that I mentioned.,132,,
509,0.97,2603.701,2606.737,This is part 2 of the conversation that we started in the community meeting last week.,132,,
510,0.97,2606.737,2619.183,"Again, last week, we had the opportunity to hear from the director and Separately, we heard from Ben noble who is the director.",132,,
511,0.97,2619.183,2623.887,Those two presentations present part 1 of the analysis in terms of the revenue coming into the city.,132,,
512,0.97,2623.887,2650.881,"And then really, the second and probably more interesting point for us in terms of our budget planning will be part 2 and that will be presented by the central staff and will provide the full outlook for the remainder of 2022 and the Six- year financial plan going forward . in full counsel coming up tomorrow, I will be sponsoring a resolution to stop the privatization of the Medicare system.",132,,
513,0.97,2650.881,2654.885,This is a resolution that many jurisdictions are including in our country as well.,132,,
514,0.97,2654.885,2659.59,And I was requested to put this resolution forward by our France from the Puget sound advocates for action.,132,,
515,0.97,2659.59,2669.867,"The current Copresident is my former mentor and boss, Jeff Johnson who is working on this issue.",132,,
516,0.97,2669.867,2671.635,This will be up for consideration tomorrow afternoon.,132,,
517,0.97,2671.635,2676.774,And my staff did circulate the resolution as well last week to the floor.,132,,
518,0.97,2676.774,2690.721,"Very briefly, the resolution calls out the concerns around the privatization of the Medicare system and savers the termination of the accountable care organization's realizing equity access and community health which is a mouthful.",132,,
519,0.97,2690.721,2696.26,"And the Acronym for that is, Aco reach.",132,,
520,0.97,2696.26,2704.535,The Aco reach program is a program that is currently being considered by the Federal delegation and the Federal administration.,132,,
521,0.97,2704.535,2713.844,The Biden administration ended the direct contracting pilot and Rebranded it as the Aco reach pilot beginning in January of 2023.,132,,
522,0.97,2713.844,2720.017,The concern however comes from public health advocates and those concerned about access to health insurance across the country.,132,,
523,0.97,2720.017,2726.69,And folks really see little difference between the Aco reach program in the direct contracting pilot from the previous Trump administration.,132,,
524,0.97,2726.69,2744.241,Both the pilot programs allow for third-party private entities to wedge themselves between patients and their Healthcare providers and to draw down the Medicare trust by making huge profits in several ways including weakening services for Medicare beneficiaries.,132,,
525,0.97,2744.241,2760.09,"If folks have had the chance to work with members in the past, the Puget sound advocate for retirement action, you know these are folks that have continually expressed the need to strengthen Medicare services, especially for the elderly population and to strengthen things like social security.",132,,
526,0.97,2760.09,2765.362,So this is very much in line with some of the previous efforts they brought forward.,132,,
527,0.97,2765.362,2778.041,And here they would especially call out that there is no clear plan for the Aco reach pilot to address the fundamental inequities suffered by by Puck communities and due to historic under Resourcing.,132,,
528,0.97,2778.041,2782.179,The resolution was sent around last Friday and I hope you have a chance to review the language in the resolution.,132,,
529,0.97,2782.179,2786.45,We look forward to answering any questions you might have tomorrow.,132,,
530,0.97,2786.45,2789.119,"And again, the importance of Medicare, especially for the elderly community.",132,,
531,0.97,2789.119,2795.926,Also for folks in the disabled community is important for us to continue to protect.,132,,

642,0.97,3681.377,3683.179,And I have not seen any evidence to the contrary.,141,,
643,0.97,3683.179,3695.324,"And so again, I will say that, in order to compete for a limited pool of applicants, we should, Seattle should employ staffing incentive programs as well.",141,,
