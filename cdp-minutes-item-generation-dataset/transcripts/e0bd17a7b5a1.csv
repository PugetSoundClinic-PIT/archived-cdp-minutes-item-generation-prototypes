40,0.97,385.785,386.285,I'm an Arborist.,7,,
41,0.97,386.352,411.377,I wanted to let you know that I filed three complaints recently with the Department of instruction and land inspection and all three of them are not valid because of your various problems with your lack of ability to enter a property to inspect it.,7,,
42,0.97,411.444,427.66,"And there are some loopholes in the code that allow a developer to clear their land, based on gaining access to the property, or being able to survey the property.",7,,
43,0.97,427.727,445.511,"And without the inspector's ability to enter the property, one of the items next door to the garden has been object served when they were standing outside the boundary of the property.",7,,
44,0.97,445.578,473.206,"Another one is the lack of records keeping by Sdci for old projects at the Westwood mall in West Seattle, where they couldn't find the original planning documents that showed trees were required either . So then when small manager cut down the trees, there is no record he was required to replace them.",7,,
45,0.97,473.272,479.045,So we have got this upcoming management plan that is heavily slanted toward racial equity now.,7,,
46,0.97,479.111,487.019,"Whereas about a year and a half ago, it was focused on how we should manage the trees in our city.",7,,
47,0.97,487.086,499.599,"And we have a lack of data, because our aerial photographs, taken from satellites, using radar do not tell any information about the condition of the tree.",7,,
48,0.97,499.665,507.506,So I hope you guys can start to get a better tree inventory . Thanks a lot for listening.,7,,
49,0.97,507.573,507.974,"Thanks, Michael.",8,,

51,0.97,517.049,517.717,Good morning.,10,,
52,0.97,517.783,533.065,"I'm going to talk about the tree protection update and what is on the agenda includes the tracking of tree loss, but it does not appear to be in the presentation for today.",10,,
53,0.97,533.132,535.902,Urban trees are our lifeline . for all life.,10,,
54,0.97,535.968,544.71,Seattle has recognized this essential and critical role of trees by establishing a goal of 30% canopy cover in just 16 years from now.,10,,
55,0.97,544.777,551.851,If the tree is not planted in the ground today it is unlikely we are going It's chief that goal.,10,,
56,0.97,551.918,556.455,"By canny cover, we are referring to cover over people and Streetscape.",10,,
57,0.97,556.522,561.327,Only trees can provide overhead canopy and filter the air of an ever growing population.,10,,
58,0.97,561.394,572.038,Your actions in this matter are not addressing just an immediate need but a future lifeline.,10,,
59,0.97,572.104,574.874,Do we have that trees planted today?,10,,
60,0.97,574.941,577.743,Are we maturing a stable canopy.,10,,
61,0.97,577.81,586.752,Records show Seattle is losing about 600 to 900 trees per year is replanting rate is fewer than the trees being last on the street.,10,,
62,0.97,586.819,598.13,However we are losing exceptional and significant trees and tree grows on property with a higher rate of 800 to 900 development being posted this year.,10,,
63,0.97,598.197,603.102,Without providing the pace to Replant canopy trees.,10,,
64,0.97,603.169,605.071,This doesn't count single family projects.,10,,
65,0.97,605.137,613.713,I really appreciate examples of good and about multi-family developments with and without tree canopy within his area that he resides.,10,,
66,0.97,613.779,620.619,"We need more density and more canopy cover, and it has been demonstrated that we can have both.",10,,
67,0.97,620.686,627.46,"That being true, accounting for tree loss on private property is not a trivial matter of simply individual's property rights.",10,,
68,0.97,627.526,639.071,It is a matter of social responsibility and equity for all in every neighborhood . So please include tree loss accounting in today's agenda . Thank you very much.,10,,

75,0.97,663.162,668.467,I think it is great that we are trying to go forward on a new program.,13,,
76,0.97,668.534,704.57,"However I do not trust DC I. they have a long history of obstruction and I would like to talk about two pieces of that . one, I was a member of the Seattle's urban forest group from 1998 to the year 2000 formed by the city council . and the urban force work group was convened in 1998, which included people concerned with the ability to conduct business in the city and conservationists.",13,,
77,0.97,704.637,711.877,"The work group met several times, discussing and identifying specific ideas regarding the retention of trees.",13,,
78,0.97,711.944,717.75,In 1999 the strategic planning office presented a series of limitation actions.,13,,
79,0.97,717.817,737.87,"This is you know, decades ago . and there is a former Dpd from a 1999 briefing from tree protection legislative and administrative recommendations from 1999.",13,,
80,0.97,737.937,739.138,Let's jump ahead to more Úcurrent.,13,,
81,0.97,739.205,754.386,I was bike riding through the city and saw this beautiful tree in front of a development sign and I wrote a letter to the city and the tree is in the Greenwood area at 927 North 92Nd street.,13,,
82,0.97,754.453,757.623,I sent the Council a copy of my original letter.,13,,
83,0.97,757.69,762.928,The response back from the land use area was thank you for your comment.,13,,
84,0.97,762.995,774.74,"None of these trees meet the threshold for exceptional, therefore no Arborist report was requested and no protection is required.",13,,
85,0.97,774.807,785.851,The bottom of the letter talks about being stewards of the city and acknowledging ancestral land.,13,,
86,0.97,785.918,786.285,This is hypocrisy.,13,,
87,0.97,786.352,790.322,"Thank you, Richard.",14,,

96,0.97,846.412,856.055,"Good morning, thank you for having us allowing us to speak . I'm speaking today on behalf of plant amnesty and our membership.",19,,
97,0.97,856.121,872.638,"I'm urging the city Council to pass an update ordinance now and not wait one, two or five years, while we continue to lose exceptional trees, tree groves and overall tree canopy over the entire city.",19,,
98,0.97,872.705,895.361,"This loss is detrimental in areas of the city historically lacking in tree canopy, so I'm urging the Council, and our urban plan planners to address this urban inequality by getting to work today to track, retain and add trees in the face of development pressure . We have lot tremendous ground over the last 12 years and longer.",19,,
99,0.97,895.427,906.739,But I know our city can be both more accommodate and go healthier for our citizens and for the planet as a whole . Thank you.,19,,

109,0.97,946.211,960.859,Council urged Dpd to submit legislation to establish a comprehensive set of regulations and incentives to limit the removal of trees and promote the retention and addition of trees within the city of Seattle in both public and private property.,23,,

116,0.97,1015.614,1021.253,There is no need to wait to discuss further it is a system that already works.,23,,

140,0.97,1141.74,1170.502,I'm Erin Dougherty from the Department of neighborhoods . This ordinance is to codify the controls and incentives agreement that was signed by the property owner and the city historic preservation officer . The landmark nomination was made by a community member and local historian Larry Johnston . So I have included the designation standards for reference and we can come back to those if we want to look at the specific language.,31,,
141,0.97,1170.569,1197.596,"This is the Swaddish Club at 1920 Dexter Avenue North . The landmarks board designated this property September 2, 2020 and selected standards C, D, and F. so essentially, they have recognized it for its cultural significance, its architectural character and style and also visual prominence in the neighborhood.",31,,
142,0.97,1197.663,1231.697,"The property is much larger than where the building sits, so there is a buffer of vacated alleys to the South and East . You see that indicated here on the slide by the Red line . the entire building exterior is controlled as part of the landmark and a portion of the interior which includes the Two- story lobby face, the Threating stair and the landing up above . The club was founded in 1892 by Swedish immigrants living in the Stockholm hotel at first and Bell in Bell town.",31,,
143,0.97,1231.763,1251.583,The club built their first building in 1902 at eighth and olive and after World War II the club began planning for a new facility and began plans on a larger site in 1953.,31,,
144,0.97,1251.65,1252.884,Steiner was the principle designer.,31,,
145,0.97,1252.951,1268.367,He was the son of Swedish immigrants and was a member of the club when they purchased this you be site in 1957. this is an example of mid century architecture exhibiting the language described as the International style.,31,,
146,0.97,1268.433,1286.718,"The building was clearly inspired by the world renowned architect, and his design of the Reynolds aluminum building . The Swedish Club was orally clad on three sides with a cast aluminum screen of Interlooking rings, similar in appearance to the Reynolds building.",31,,
147,0.97,1286.785,1292.324,"Large sections were later removed on the North, South and East facades.",31,,
148,0.97,1292.391,1306.471,"I would like to pass this on to Christine so she can speak about their organization I can't thank you, everyone . I'm happy to be hear.",31,,

158,0.97,1371.069,1371.837,Yes it does.,34,,
159,0.97,1371.903,1383.648,The building is to Swedes as the waltz is to Austria.,35,,
160,0.97,1383.715,1384.282,That's right.,36,,
161,0.97,1384.349,1384.816,They love their homes.,36,,
162,0.97,1384.883,1390.889,"Visitors to our Club walk in the doors and say Oh, yes, the Swedes have the most beautiful Club houses.",36,,
163,0.97,1390.956,1394.459,So this is a beautiful clubhouse.,36,,
164,0.97,1394.526,1398.73,But I want to tell you another interesting thing about the Sweepish club.,36,,
165,0.97,1398.797,1408.607,"In the time of immigration, those immigrants who came were poor.",36,,
166,0.97,1408.673,1435.867,"Most immigrant groups established a club that was part social helpfulness, part Healthcare, and part social just getting together with people from the home country . So you have sons of Norway, which is originally a death benefit seat, along with getting together for Socializing.",36,,
167,0.97,1435.934,1450.582,"Many of the organizations have that same component, health insurance, in addition to getting together to socialize . The Sweeds didn't do that . The Sweeds had a different model.",36,,
168,0.97,1450.649,1455.921,The very same men who created the Swedish Club started Swedish hospital.,36,,
169,0.97,1455.987,1461.259,But they did it separately . So the Swedish club has been from the beginning strictly social.,36,,
170,0.97,1461.326,1481.046,"The first building was a place for the men to get together to read the newspapers, smoke cigars and eat all the food the women made for them.",36,,
171,0.97,1481.112,1487.419,This building came along in 1959 or 60 when I-5 knocked our former building out.,36,,
172,0.97,1487.485,1496.061,It was the entrance ramps on to I-5 . So in building was built and this was again built to serve a social furnace.,36,,
173,0.97,1496.127,1504.736,"It had a dance floor on one floor, a first class restaurant on the top.",36,,
174,0.97,1504.803,1507.505,Membership swelled at the Swedish club.,36,,
175,0.97,1507.572,1512.611,"There were 7000 members in the 60s and early 70s, and people came for two reasons.",36,,
176,0.97,1512.677,1527.859,"They joined for two reasons, one is to take trips to Sweden and another was to eat in the restaurant.",36,,
177,0.97,1527.926,1529.895,"Times changed, membership dropped Precip Tusly.",36,,
178,0.97,1529.961,1532.264,I became the executive director about 11 years ago.,36,,
179,0.97,1532.33,1535.901,At that time we had 500 members.,36,,
180,0.97,1535.967,1546.611,"We took on a dedicated let's save the club effort, and just before the pandemic hit, we were up to 1400 members.",36,,
181,0.97,1546.678,1550.916,"It has gone down a few hundred, about 1100 now.",36,,
182,0.97,1550.982,1558.356,But this club still serves a purpose as a home for the Nordic American community and their friends.,36,,
183,0.97,1558.423,1571.703,"It is a place to have celebrations, it is a place to eat, to take language classes and we are very proud of it . We are very proud of the landmark designation as well . Thank you.",36,,
184,0.97,1571.77,1573.605,Does anybody have questions for May?,36,,
185,0.97,1573.672,1603.501,"Christine, that good overview and I want to just take a moment to highlight the fact that in your history that you just provided, you mentioned it was a place for the men to smoke cigars and read the newspaper and that you have, leading the organization as a woman, have swelled the organization's membership . So while times have changed, we are trusting in you to keep us moving forward.",37,,
186,0.97,1603.568,1607.672,Is he I just want to Hey light that.,37,,
187,0.97,1607.739,1620.185,"That times have changed, and that we relay on your leadership in the club to move that membership from 500 to 1400 people.",37,,
188,0.97,1620.251,1622.787,"Thank you very much, Councilman Strauss.",38,,
189,0.97,1622.854,1625.523,I have some but colleagues?,39,,
190,0.97,1625.59,1635.867,And I do want to let the record reflect Council member Lewis joined us just ahead of public comment.,39,,
191,0.97,1635.934,1639.471,"Other colleagues, do you have questions?",39,,
192,0.97,1639.537,1652.584,"Great and could we move back to the slides with the control, C, is associated in a political way.",39,,
193,0.97,1652.65,1657.088,I think that has been described by Christine very well.,39,,
194,0.97,1657.155,1667.465,If we could move to D. and Emboize distinctive characteristics of an architectural style.,39,,
195,0.97,1667.532,1694.325,"Erin, you spoke about the International style and if the viewing public would be interested to look up the Reynolds building, I think it is very interesting to see the comparisons and Ma might be difficult to see is behind Christine is some of those aluminum rings have been removed so the view has been improved to the Lake.",39,,
196,0.97,1694.392,1697.695,"F, being the visual prominence in the neighborhood.",39,,
197,0.97,1697.762,1732.23,"It is an easily identifiable feature in the neighborhood . Speaking to the controls, which are the exterior, the lobby space, stairs and landings, either Christine or Erin, I have been in the club so many times I know what it looks like and I can, I know why these spaces are special, can either one of you provide a summary of what is special about that first floor had been by and the floating staircase?",39,,
198,0.97,1732.297,1733.698,He'll jump in,40,,
199,0.97,1733.765,1734.432,That is good.,41,,
200,0.97,1734.499,1738.57,The had been accommodate a reception by the King.,42,,
201,0.97,1738.636,1742.273,I don't believe the King has been here.,42,,
202,0.97,1742.34,1742.974,But I don't know.,42,,
203,0.97,1743.041,1763.628,I was able to be the on the welcoming Committee for the crown Princes to princess to come and to welcome her in . that is the cultural reason the lobby is so magnificent.,42,,
204,0.97,1763.695,1764.696,"Erin, can you jump in?",42,,
205,0.97,1764.762,1777.642,"Sure when the board contemplates they try to determine what the character defining about a property and they are also trying to think about what are the things they would want to participate in review of, for them to be changed in the fought.",43,,
206,0.97,1777.709,1787.819,It is also to strike a balance between giving the property owner in flexibility.,43,,
207,0.97,1787.886,1794.893,"So initially, when the board reviewed this building they continue operated the entire building.",43,,
208,0.97,1794.959,1806.337,And in that designation they further refined that to be just that main lobby space.,43,,
209,0.97,1806.404,1811.376,The Kerrick of the lobby and the volume of the space.,43,,
210,0.97,1811.442,1822.053,They thought it exhibited Beth the sort of craft and character but it is also a gathering space.,43,,
211,0.97,1822.12,1841.206,"And it has beautiful art work and other exhibits that the club shares in that space . and the controls in the agreement give them the flexibility to change those features in any way they want . So it is really just the architectural materials that the board would review, if they were to be altered in the future.",43,,
212,0.97,1841.272,1848.546,Or if they were to change the space by wanting to go sub divide it or something.,43,,
213,0.97,1848.613,1850.148,Which seems highly unlikely.,43,,
214,0.97,1850.215,1871.903,"Thank you both for Christine, that was an interesting cultural reference . hopefully we will have the King of Sweden be able to come . I was lucky enough to meet his majesty, King Harold V of Norway.",44,,
215,0.97,1871.97,1874.439,Let's see if we can't pull King Gustav here as well.,44,,
216,0.97,1874.505,1877.909,We need to do that.,45,,
217,0.97,1877.976,1878.276,We should.,46,,
218,0.97,1878.343,1878.61,I love this.,46,,
219,0.97,1878.676,1894.459,Just real also share with me why we are including the alleys to the South and east of the building and not the parking lots adjacent to the building in this landmark designation?,47,,
220,0.97,1894.525,1912.877,"So from the board's perspective, if you can see the screen, the site comes down and has a parking lot to the South and east of the buildings . The board initially wanted to include those parking lots, because it gives a large buffer around the building.",48,,
221,0.97,1912.944,1927.492,"But the property owner, the Swedish Club, wanted the flexibility to utilize those areas in the future, potentially, without board review.",48,,
222,0.97,1927.558,1929.36,And so those vacated alleys became sort of a natural buffer.,48,,
223,0.97,1929.427,1932.664,Roughly 15 or 20 feet from the face of the building.,48,,
224,0.97,1932.73,1942.774,So it seemed reasonable to allow them to have the ability to utilize those properties in the future.,48,,
225,0.97,1942.84,1958.122,Because doing that may be able to help support the long Staning club that reside in this building and to help actually preserve and protect it because it needs to be maintained.,48,,
226,0.97,1958.189,1959.023,"Thank you, Erin.",49,,
227,0.97,1959.09,1973.705,"Typically, in historic designations, the property owner is the one who submits the initial request to have the historic designation placed . In this case we had a third party.",49,,
228,0.97,1973.771,1986.751,Could either Christine or Erin speak to how that occurred? I know sometimes that can be a contentious process and it doesn't sound like that happened here.,49,,
229,0.97,1986.818,1990.188,I'm happy to do that.,50,,
230,0.97,1990.254,1993.391,"Larry Johnson is a marvelous, this Architetural historian in Seattle.",50,,
231,0.97,1993.458,1997.829,He used to be a member of our board.,50,,
232,0.97,1997.895,2002.433,"And he really wanted us to landmark it a few years back, maybe five years ago.",50,,
233,0.97,2002.5,2016.848,"The time wasn't right for the% Swedish Club, at that point . We were still working on getting our feet off the ground in this new little lien Ium . So we did not move forward with it.",50,,
234,0.97,2016.914,2027.225,"I believe Larry'S reasons for doing it now is he is retiring, he felt it should be done and we were quickly on board with him and said yes, the time is right, let's do it.",50,,
235,0.97,2027.291,2073.037,"I'll just add we do actually see a number of nominations each year that do come from outside parties . This isn't really that unusual . As you say, they are occasionally contentious, but we do our best to work with the property owner to come up with an agreement that feels reasonable to them to continue to use their buildings and sites as they would like . two other recent examples would be the La QUINTA apartments and the Royal apartments in Capitol Hill where the residents of the buildings came together to form groups to nominate the properties and had some assistance from historic Seattle to do that.",51,,
236,0.97,2073.104,2083.948,"In both cases I worked with the property owners and we were able to negotiate an agreement that I'm sorry, I have done that for the Roy view.",51,,
237,0.97,2084.015,2095.86,The La QUINTA has just been designated last weak but the owner is actually very pleased . So I think those negotiations will also be successful.,51,,
238,0.97,2095.927,2098.162,That is really context.,52,,
239,0.97,2098.229,2098.496,Thank you.,52,,
240,0.97,2098.563,2113.11,"Christine, again thank you no sharing for us how the Swedish Club split their civic duties and their social activities . I was not aware that was how Swedish hospital began.",52,,
241,0.97,2113.177,2124.555,It is very interesting to know that Swedish hospital was started by members of the Swedish club.,52,,
242,0.97,2124.622,2126.557,We are Siblings.,53,,
243,0.97,2126.624,2129.827,"Colleagues, any other questions?",54,,
244,0.97,2129.894,2133.865,"Otherwise, we'll put this to a vote.",54,,
245,0.97,2133.931,2134.198,Mr. chair?,55,,
246,0.97,2134.265,2134.432,Yes?,56,,
247,0.97,2134.499,2135.8,Thank you very much.,57,,
248,0.97,2135.867,2136.3,"Good morning, everyone.",57,,
249,0.97,2136.367,2148.546,"Thanks for the overview here . I have had the chance to go to the Swedish center, and I do have Swedish heritage on my Grandma's side.",57,,
250,0.97,2148.613,2151.115,Very beautiful setting in there.,57,,
251,0.97,2151.182,2157.655,"I appreciate the distinction about which areas are designated as landmarks, I'm glad to hear it is not the parking lot.",57,,
252,0.97,2157.722,2160.091,It is a focus on the interior lobby.,57,,
253,0.97,2160.157,2189.387,"So just want to double check . I know we have done some strategies before where we preserve facades or certain components of the building . If, for example, the Swaddish cultural center wanted to build housing above the existing building and adapt some way, then the interior would be preserved with that type of adaptation would potentially be allowed in the future, if they so desire?",57,,
254,0.97,2189.453,2214.612,So the entire the building is also clawed odd that portion of the site . So there would be a process . The certificate of approval process were they to seek to build an addition X they would work with the landmark's board through a design review process to try and find a reasonable solution O and we would ask them to look at alternatives to start that conversation.,58,,
255,0.97,2214.679,2221.352,But then they would come back and meet periodically with the board to find a reasonable outcome.,58,,
256,0.97,2221.419,2221.919,Okay great.,59,,
257,0.97,2221.986,2222.787,Thank you for that.,59,,
258,0.97,2222.853,2235.466,I think that is helpful to hear as we continue to look for opportunities to house so many folks who want to stay in this city.,59,,
259,0.97,2235.533,2238.603,I think about senior housing options and mixed generation housing.,59,,
260,0.97,2238.669,2244.976,"So wanted to just see how that would potentially fit in, if that were a desire 10 or 15 years from now.",59,,
261,0.97,2245.042,2253.951,Thank you for that update and I appreciate the overview today.,59,,
262,0.97,2254.018,2254.385,Thank you.,60,,
263,0.97,2254.452,2257.822,I'll just finish with may own comments for the viewing public.,60,,
264,0.97,2257.888,2284.548,"If you have not visited the Swedish Club, pleas do so . The had been by area that Christine described is full of interesting artifacts, interesting cultural references and interesting bits of history about the Swedish culture, as well as the stairway that we are preserving quite literally lacks as if it floats from the second story.",60,,
265,0.97,2284.615,2293.791,"So if you haven't visited, I urge you to do so at your earliest opportunity that protects public health.",60,,
266,0.97,2293.858,2306.27,"With that, hearing additional discussion we can now vet on the legislation . I move the committee recommend passage of Council bill 100021.",61,,
267,0.97,2306.337,2306.604,Second.,62,,
268,0.97,2306.671,2307.505,Thank you.,63,,
269,0.97,2307.571,2311.876,It has been moved and Seconded to recommend the passage of the bill.,63,,
270,0.97,2311.942,2329.326,"If there are no additional comments, will the clerk pleas call the roll?",63,,
271,0.97,2329.393,2331.862,Five in,64,,
272,0.97,2331.929,2335.199,"Thank you, the motion carries.",65,,
273,0.97,2335.266,2348.479,Thank you Christine Leanedder and Aaron Dougherty for being here Todayment the legislation will be before the full city council on Monday for a final vote.,65,,
274,0.97,2348.546,2349.18,"Thank you, all.",66,,
275,0.97,2349.246,2349.714,I appreciate it.,66,,
276,0.97,2349.78,2366.23,Our next item of today is the quarterly report from Seattle Department of destruction and office of Sustainability and environment on their tree protection work in response to resolution 31902.,67,,
277,0.97,2366.297,2372.503,Will you please read the abbreviated item into the record?,67,,
278,0.97,2372.57,2377.975,Item 2. Seattle office of Sustainability and environment quarterly tree report.,68,,
279,0.97,2378.042,2378.309,Thank you.,69,,
280,0.97,2378.375,2388.886,We are joined by San Trell pinto from offices of Sustainability and environment and Shonda Emory from Seattle Department of construction and inspection.,69,,
281,0.97,2388.953,2392.256,Is this your last Pleating with us?,69,,
282,0.97,2392.323,2392.59,Before today?,69,,
283,0.97,2392.656,2423.454,I am hoping it is but it might be.,70,,
284,0.97,2423.521,2434.799,Whoever is giving presentation.,71,,
285,0.97,2434.865,2436.634,"Thank you, Sandra.",72,,
286,0.97,2436.7,2504.768,"So city council adopted resolution 31902 on September 16, 2019, requesting exploring strategies to protect existing trees, increase tree canopy cover and balance city goals to support future growth and density as provided for in the city's comprehensive plan . So this resolution, has asked us to consider strategies that allow for needed housing and other in field development, as well as balancing the needs of low income and low canopy neighborhoods, and looking at other city priorities as well . So, for people that are new to this, we have been instructed to report quarterly to the chair of the land use and neighborhoods commit tea on progress made so these next few slides are going to highlight the progress that we have made to date, including the latest update on the urban forest management plan which Sandra will go over and I'll talk about our updates on the tree protection.",72,,
287,0.97,2504.835,2504.969,On.,72,,
288,0.97,2505.035,2506.003,Okay.,73,,
289,0.97,2506.07,2506.837,Thank you so much.,73,,
290,0.97,2506.904,2526.69,"So the last time that we were together, we shared with you the kind of effort that we put in place to be able to widely spread the word around, wanting to receive input from the public on the Foreof the management plan update.",73,,
291,0.97,2526.757,2529.86,It is multiyear effort that initiated in 2018.,73,,
292,0.97,2529.927,2539.87,"We shared the draft plan for public input from October to November, and I just wanted to point out a Typo in the report that says December.",73,,
293,0.97,2539.937,2540.204,My apologies.,73,,
294,0.97,2540.271,2580.077,"We shared the document through the end of November, and received 178 public comments . 165 of those responses were to the Online comment form that also, and then also 13 direct E- mails from residence and organizations, including the Seattle green spaces coalition, the green cities, tree pack and the University of Washington . In all of these public comments have been posted on the trees for Seattle Website for transparency.",73,,
295,0.97,2580.144,2584.748,That is Seattle.Gov/Tree s under the tab management.,73,,
296,0.97,2584.815,2598.729,"So then after reviewing the public Inputting detail, the city program produced a summary of those comments and provided also initial recommendations on how to incorporate the public input into the plan.",73,,
297,0.97,2598.796,2619.483,And that is something I did want to point out is the majority of the comments were related to the tree regulation update work currently underway . and the team shared that information with Shanda and with me so we could take it into consideration as we continue our work.,73,,
298,0.97,2619.55,2624.355,"On slide three, broad themes?",74,,
299,0.97,2624.421,2624.621,Yeah.,75,,
300,0.97,2624.688,2627.858,Or patterns from the public input?,76,,
301,0.97,2627.925,2628.325,Yes.,77,,
302,0.97,2628.392,2643.874,"So what we did is after you know, Lake and we really wanted to be respectful and appreciate the enormous amount of involvement and investment of time and effort from the community.",77,,
303,0.97,2643.941,2649.847,So we have several sessions where we discussed all of this input.,77,,
304,0.97,2649.913,2655.819,"We produced a summary, we actually grouped it into kind of themes, so that we could address it.",77,,
305,0.97,2655.886,2673.103,"So thank you for that question . Yes, so as I mentioned, the bulk of the comments was about tree regulations update and we made sure to share that with the working group, dressing this issue.",77,,
306,0.97,2673.17,2687.084,We also had input into the plant structure in general . an example is that people felt it was a little bit difficult to discern what was the flow of the document.,77,,
307,0.97,2687.151,2713.51,"Is he one recommendation was to maybe add an executive summary inside of the document or what we are recommending a planned roadmap section, where people could just look at the reduction and decide whether they wanted to dive into the details of the plan or go directly into the outcome section or the strategy section and the action agenda.",77,,
308,0.97,2713.577,2719.249,Another kind we grouped was planned content at different levels.,78,,
309,0.97,2719.316,2730.26,"For example, people really wanted to make sure that we were balanced in our presentation of the benefits of urban trees compared to the challenges.",78,,
310,0.97,2730.327,2737.968,So we kind of are recommending beefing up that section of the benefits.,78,,
311,0.97,2738.035,2754.017,"Also you know, talking a little bit about the specifics of the work that we do, so there were comments that were more having to do not so much with the plan update itself, but the way we do work.",78,,
312,0.97,2754.084,2762.826,"And we for example, focusing City resources on tree care, that is an example.",78,,
313,0.97,2762.893,2794.224,"To fully fund inventories . to also you know, look at performing economic impact and assessments from tree loss and then there was another theme that was a little bit Makeover specific in terms of tree data and some people kind of providing their opinion around the effectiveness of lighter as a measuring tool, looking at potentially you have seen artificial intelligence in making recommendations of using Google earth and other Technologies out there.",78,,
314,0.97,2794.291,2821.518,"And then I would say a last group would be kind of very general and high level, kind of like looking a little bit into how do we balance equity issues and environmental issues -X also some comments getting a little bit more into the detail of comprehensive plan that has no short-term forestry goals . So it was a broad variety of input.",78,,
315,0.97,2821.585,2834.531,"Then of course your urban forestry Commission that is the technical advisory group provided very specific, almost line item comments and recommendations.",78,,
316,0.97,2834.598,2834.831,Thanks.,79,,
317,0.97,2834.898,2837.968,I believe we skipped ahead to slide five.,79,,
318,0.97,2838.035,2838.202,Are we?,79,,
319,0.97,2838.268,2841.238,Im so sorry.,80,,
320,0.97,2841.305,2841.605,No problem.,81,,
321,0.97,2841.672,2847.811,"Sorry, this is the so after talking oops, I'm so sorry.",82,,
322,0.97,2847.878,2857.187,I'm having a real hard time with this presentation today.,82,,
323,0.97,2857.254,2858.422,Here we go.,83,,
324,0.97,2858.488,2858.755,My apologies.,83,,
325,0.97,2858.822,2882.946,"So what I wanted also to share is just kind of give a Hey level idea on where we are . So we have completed the engagement phase I, which is a very intent way to engage in cult Rattily appropriate and in language, with the community . We do that.",83,,
326,0.97,2883.013,2885.983,"We this inclusive engagement, listening sessions and an initial assess.",83,,
327,0.97,2886.049,2902.399,The that helped us produce a very initial draft that we took back to community for an exercise some reporting back . wanting to know and sure that we heard them correctly and that their priorities were presented in the document . Then we did internal departmental review.,83,,
328,0.97,2902.466,2914.978,"We went into public input, where we are now, and next steps is, we are in the process of incorporating the public input based on the recommendations that we are elevating internally.",83,,
329,0.97,2915.045,2919.65,We also are working on the checklist.,83,,
330,0.97,2919.716,2940.003,"And will issue determination . and once we have a final drop, we are Intenting to bring it later this spring to Council . with that I'm going to pass it on to Shanda to get more into the details of the tree regulations.",83,,
331,0.97,2940.07,2941.471,"Thank you, Sandra.",84,,
332,0.97,2941.538,2949.212,"Yeah so here when trees are cut illegally, we are seeing that increased fines are working as a greater deterrent.",84,,
333,0.97,2949.279,2978.508,"Our most recent and current reports indict kit that the range of penalties that we have seen over the last few weeks and months has been $10,000 and up with the most recent penalty that was $99,000 for the illegal removal of an exceptional tree under the triple penalty provision . and then at our last briefing, we stated that our team had applied for a large Federal grant to assist the city in our tree protection work.",84,,
334,0.97,2978.575,2991.655,"So this morning, I'm pleased to report that we were successful in obtaining the full amount and we received grant funding from the United States Department of Interior to fund the city's canopy cover assessment.",84,,
335,0.97,2991.722,3008.672,So we anticipate this work will begin within the next few weeks as we move into spring and the trees have a new foliage to allow if a leaf on canopy cover assessment measurement.,84,,
336,0.97,3008.739,3018.181,These sessions have provided another opportunity for staff to benefit on the expertise of commissioners and to collaborate on technical issues.,84,,
337,0.97,3018.248,3020.784,We have had five Deliberative sessions to date.,84,,
338,0.97,3020.851,3027.991,"We also briefed the urban forestry Commission on February 10th, Harding the is the us of the updated draft director rule.",84,,
339,0.97,3028.058,3044.641,"At this time, we continue to review additional feedback that we received on the draft, including the inclusion of a new requirement that all tree service providers will need to acknowledge that their company is aware of our tree codes when doing business in the city.",84,,
340,0.97,3044.708,3052.149,I just don't off to the next slide before questions.,85,,
341,0.97,3052.215,3052.449,Go for it.,85,,
342,0.97,3052.516,3054.184,Next slide please.,86,,
343,0.97,3054.251,3056.586,No I think there is a question.,87,,
344,0.97,3056.653,3056.953,And thank you.,87,,
345,0.97,3057.02,3058.855,I didn't know if you were finished.,87,,
346,0.97,3058.922,3073.904,I know with the power point we were having some difficulties . So I wanted to circle back on to item one on this slide . Thank you for improving this enforcement.,87,,
347,0.97,3073.97,3083.146,"And the result in that first point is that $99,000 penalty . It is may understanding this is a triple penalty provision that led to this large sum.",87,,
348,0.97,3083.213,3090.22,Can you kind of speck a little bit more to what was the background?,87,,
349,0.97,3090.287,3093.924,What was the triple penalty provision?,87,,
350,0.97,3093.99,3098.195,And how does that all work?,87,,
351,0.97,3098.261,3099.529,"Yeah, absolutely.",88,,
352,0.97,3099.596,3134.364,"So this is under that director's rule that talks about willful and malicious Cuttingment so this is a chair if I Cation of our existing tree code that says that a property owner or applicant could be subject to a tripling amount of the penalty, if they are found to have willfully and maliciously cut an exceptional tree or protected tree.",88,,
353,0.97,3134.431,3138.068,So that refers back to our existing code 251-1100.,88,,
354,0.97,3138.134,3144.274,"In this case, staff has worked really hard to protect this exceptional tree.",88,,
355,0.97,3144.341,3165.729,"They have worked many hours with the applicant, trying to explain the importance and the benefits of retaining this large, mature tree X as it turned out, it was an unfortunate situation, where the applicant ended up removing the tree to allow for a Two-Car garage to be built.",88,,
356,0.97,3165.795,3175.972,"And then from were reported, enforcement went out and because of that background work, you were able to apply this triple penalty, is that correct?",89,,
357,0.97,3176.039,3176.973,"Right, correct.",90,,
358,0.97,3177.04,3178.909,And has that paid?,91,,
359,0.97,3178.975,3186.449,I would have to that.,92,,
360,0.97,3186.516,3186.783,I believe so.,92,,
361,0.97,3186.85,3187.684,Great.,93,,
362,0.97,3187.751,3189.452,I see question from Councilman Pederson.,93,,
363,0.97,3189.519,3201.131,"Thank you, chair so for this particular example . As I understand it, neighbors noticed that the tree was being removed and had to inform the city government.",94,,
364,0.97,3201.197,3204.968,And then it was routed to do the enforcement action.,94,,
365,0.97,3205.035,3223.119,So I would say the process was really driven by the community that had to reach out and so I think this points back to the need to strengthen our ordinance.,94,,
366,0.97,3223.186,3232.195,"And to make sure we are registering Arborists and other improvements we can make, a lot of which we heard from public speakers today.",94,,
367,0.97,3232.262,3236.533,So eager to get that revised tree ordinance.,94,,
368,0.97,3236.6,3236.967,Thanks.,94,,
369,0.97,3237.033,3237.334,Thank you.,95,,
370,0.97,3237.4,3251.815,"You know I will flag whether it is a pothole, a site where people have been dumping, a streetlight out, we rely on every day people to report to the city government what needs to be fixed.",95,,
371,0.97,3251.881,3273.336,"Not knowing the specifics of the situation, it does sound that it was taking a fair amount of Proactive work unless we put an Inspector living at that site, you know, it sounds from your report that neighbors reported it as soon as it was occurring.",95,,
372,0.97,3273.403,3274.604,A correct,96,,
373,0.97,3274.671,3274.904,Yes.,97,,
374,0.97,3274.971,3304.567,"However the ability to get out there and prevent further cutting and also as I understand it, we now have the way Arborists are selected by the real estate developer, it sort of Bakes in a bias process . We can go further upstream to prevent some of these things from happening by strengthening the ordinance.",97,,
375,0.97,3304.634,3319.649,I absolutely heard I heard saying we are now going to begin requiring Arborists to sign a document state that go they understand the code . has this already been put in place?,98,,
376,0.97,3319.716,3326.056,This is something are proposing in the revised draft director rule.,99,,
377,0.97,3326.122,3326.423,Okay.,100,,
378,0.97,3326.489,3332.262,So I think that exactly to your point Councilman Bedter son.,101,,
379,0.97,3332.328,3356.352,"We know that a lot of the illegal tree cutting that happened, especially in sensitive areas are performed by Arborists that maybe aren't necessarily from the city or that the developer or the Homeowner selects these Arborists for the very reason that they know what they are doing is not legal.",101,,
380,0.97,3356.419,3365.829,"That, I don't think is something that can necessarily be prevented, by law, being created.",101,,
381,0.97,3365.895,3370.133,On but what is being proposed in the rule and at the end of the day with the ordinance is important.,101,,
382,0.97,3370.2,3399.929,"But again, we are going to have to rely on every day people to make sure that we are receiving reports as again, from dumping to potholes to street lights, we have to rely on every day people to make these reports . those are all my questions . do you have more comments? no?",101,,
383,0.97,3399.996,3401.731,Thank you.,101,,
384,0.97,3401.798,3403.9,Take it away.,101,,
385,0.97,3403.967,3404.2,Great.,102,,
386,0.97,3404.267,3404.734,Thank you.,102,,
387,0.97,3404.801,3425.622,"So the trees for Seattle Website together with the tree pro sections Website has featured improvements we have made to tree protection best practices, including our internal Arborists reviews and links to our open houses and information about updated tree related tips that will be posted there.",102,,
388,0.97,3425.688,3453.583,"And as far as public outreach, our team has committed to dedicating resources this year to engage and connect in culturally and LING Witically appropriate ways with historically Underrepresented communities as well as other Stakeholders including homeowners, Renters, businesses, builders, neighborhood groups, environmental organizations, climate and environmental justice organizations.",102,,
389,0.97,3453.65,3464.194,This past week we have haired an outside consultant to begin with the preparation of a statistically significant survey that will be administered to Stakeholders citywide.,102,,
390,0.97,3464.26,3475.839,On a parallel track we are working with the Department of neighborhoods to engage with communities in culturally appropriate methods and in language.,102,,
391,0.97,3475.905,3480.543,We hope to use one or two community liaisons to do that work.,102,,
392,0.97,3480.61,3496.559,"As you have heard in our previous briefings to Council, we have learned from our work in updating the urban forest management plan that many residents have expressed they want continued engagement from city staff on tree related issues.",102,,
393,0.97,3496.626,3505.969,So part of this work is to dedicate resources to Prioritize and center the needs of low income and low canopy neighborhoods throughout this process.,102,,
394,0.97,3506.035,3544.941,We really want to make sure that we are centering and Prioritizing communities every step of the way to provide additional protection to help reduce and address environmental disparities . As far as next steps our team is moving forward to use a data driven approach to implement a comprehensive citywide survey to measure resident attitudes regarding existing tree codes and working to incorporate feedback we have heard in our racial equity tool kit analysis to help inform our recommendations.,102,,
395,0.97,3545.008,3549.512,So outreach and engagement is taking place mid March through the end of June.,102,,
396,0.97,3549.579,3554.55,"Our team will document community input, considered part of the tree protections update.",102,,
397,0.97,3554.617,3587.283,"This summer in June July, we will have developed further several of our recommendations, focusing on the race and social justice implications of each . and later this year, as early as the third quarter, our team will be ready to share a public draft of our proposed legislation, as well as issuing a determination at that time . We are happy to we are any questions.",102,,
398,0.97,3587.35,3588.384,"Council members, any questions?",103,,
399,0.97,3588.451,3590.053,I have one question.,103,,
400,0.97,3590.119,3608.604,"I got so wrapped up talking about enforcement, I had one question on slide 5 and let me try and go back to slide five . There we go.",103,,
401,0.97,3608.671,3609.238,Yeah what is your question?,103,,
402,0.97,3609.305,3618.514,It is great to that we have obtained funding from the United States Department of Intear year for a canopy cover assessment.,104,,
403,0.97,3618.581,3626.99,May question here is how would this assessment relate to or build upon the previous?,104,,
404,0.97,3627.056,3630.393,And can you remained the body what year that was conducted?,104,,
405,0.97,3630.46,3631.627,Right.,105,,
406,0.97,3631.694,3637.633,So the last time we had a lighter canopy cover assessment was in 2016.,105,,
407,0.97,3637.7,3652.715,"And pest practices calls for an assessment to be done every five years, so we are very excited to have the opportunity to do it again this year . So I want to clarify.",105,,
408,0.97,3652.782,3661.457,Seattle is part of a consortium of municipality that get together to be able to afford lighter data.,105,,
409,0.97,3661.524,3676.539,"So we received a group the consortium received funding so that we are able to actually acquire the data, which opinions a plane is going to be flying the region with the lighter technology acquiring data.",105,,
410,0.97,3676.606,3680.243,That is separate from the canopy cover assessment.,105,,
411,0.97,3680.309,3686.749,"So lighter, I wanted to clarify, Shonda mentioned it is leaf on, but the reality is, it is leaf off.",105,,
412,0.97,3686.816,3691.387,It takes place when the leaves on trees are off.,105,,
413,0.97,3691.454,3698.227,Because there is a lot of uses beyond canopy cover assessment for this type of data.,105,,
414,0.97,3698.294,3709.038,"You know, it helps plan for emergency response and in one example, it is like what is happening also with a lot of uses.",105,,
415,0.97,3709.105,3721.851,"So what we do, with that canopy cover assessment is we use a protocol established by the U.S. Forest service where we pair the lighter leaf off data with satellite imagery.",105,,
416,0.97,3721.918,3738.734,"What is exciting is, that we now have a base Ryan, which was 2016, and we are going to be using the exact same technology, methodology and protocol to determine canopy cover change over time.",105,,
417,0.97,3738.801,3740.103,And this is so exciting.,105,,
418,0.97,3740.169,3753.516,"Because in the past, I think I have mentioned before in one of her briefings, we have used what at the time was determined to be the best technology . and of course technology evolves.",105,,
419,0.97,3753.583,3766.629,"So every time we did an assessment, we ended up using different technology that rendered past assessments in apples and oranges, whenever we wanted to compare them.",105,,
420,0.97,3766.696,3783.779,"So it was very challenging . We tried to do an apples to Anles comparison in 2016 with lighter data we acquired in 2001 and 2002, and just the definition was just so different that it was impossible to do.",105,,
421,0.97,3783.846,3787.85,Is he this time we have everything that we need.,105,,
422,0.97,3787.917,3815.912,"And we are getting the funding in place for the canopy cover assessment to happen this year . and internally the team of urban forestry departments is working on that, so we can have a canopy cover change over time and I think many different Department are going to be able to use this data to continue their work, including the tree regulations team.",105,,
423,0.97,3815.978,3816.612,So very helpful.,106,,
424,0.97,3816.679,3826.155,"Yes, it is an incredibly important technology, as you mentioned, it has many benefits.",106,,
425,0.97,3826.222,3828.191,The landslide or the volcanic fate of our Cascade mountains.,106,,
426,0.97,3828.257,3838.634,Right and this is exciting we also get the benefit from this.,107,,
427,0.97,3838.701,3838.901,Right.,108,,
428,0.97,3838.968,3847.81,Those are all of May questions.,109,,
429,0.97,3847.877,3859.822,Do we have any Aquestions? I am seeing no further questions.,109,,
430,0.97,3859.889,3862.758,There we go.,109,,
431,0.97,3862.825,3867.163,I that you if I waited long enough.,109,,
432,0.97,3867.23,3867.463,Wonderful.,109,,
433,0.97,3867.53,3872.568,I'm glad that I took that extra moment.,109,,
434,0.97,3872.635,3874.237,Take it away.,109,,
435,0.97,3874.303,3891.287,"Thank you chair so for you, do we have a Database that shows when exceptional trees are taken down, do Bekeep track that have?",110,,
436,0.97,3891.354,3895.858,I would be happy that.,111,,
437,0.97,3895.925,3903.232,We do have information in our system that tracks tree Removals.,111,,
438,0.97,3903.299,3922.551,"Hazardous tree Removals and right now we are tracking trees through or worksheet right now . that data is still being put together, so I don't have you know, a lot to share at this point.",111,,
439,0.97,3922.618,3927.023,But that is something we are working toward.,111,,
440,0.97,3927.089,3927.456,Okay.,112,,
441,0.97,3927.523,3937.133,And then the last question is when can we expect the tree ordinance to be delivered from the executive?,112,,
442,0.97,3937.199,3941.003,"Yeah, I think as third quarter is what we can do.",113,,
443,0.97,3941.07,3952.748,I relevant are he want to make sure that we hear from everybody in this public outreach effort.,113,,
444,0.97,3952.815,3955.217,Before we move forward with recommendations.,113,,
445,0.97,3955.284,3970.533,Can you also third quarter Timeline is depending upon appeals?,114,,
446,0.97,3970.599,3971.834,Yes.,115,,
447,0.97,3971.901,3976.939,That is correct.,115,,
448,0.97,3977.006,3978.274,Thank you.,116,,
449,0.97,3978.341,3982.278,No further questions?,116,,
450,0.97,3982.345,3982.545,Great.,116,,
451,0.97,3982.611,3987.85,Just a point of clarification . are we expecting two different implementation tame lines again?,116,,
452,0.97,3987.917,3989.952,I'm sorry if you are needing to repeat.,116,,
453,0.97,3990.019,4003.466,"But just to be clear, we are talking about the tree protections as well as updates to the directors rule for exceptional trees and.",116,,
454,0.97,4003.532,4011.474,"No, the update of the director's role is separate . You know, that could go if I tame.",117,,
455,0.97,4011.54,4020.249,And then the ordinance is something that I was talking about in the presentation.,117,,
456,0.97,4020.316,4023.853,And if I may jump in?,118,,
457,0.97,4023.919,4029.191,So the director's rule of the really to clarify existing code.,118,,
458,0.97,4029.258,4039.969,"That is a way to continue moving the action forward . As we, are updating existing dead.",118,,
459,0.97,4040.035,4061.69,"So to may kind of sounded a little bit Counterintuitive, Lake why are we updating a code that is soon going to be old? But what I think has been of benefit is we have been able to have, for instance, discussions in the liberty sessions that are very pertinent to the update of the code.",118,,
460,0.97,4061.757,4066.195,"So you know, it might seem like it is not moving forward, necessarily.",118,,
461,0.97,4066.262,4087.85,But the discussions are going to be very helpful as we continue to propose updates to the code.,118,,
462,0.97,4087.917,4091.52,That actually bit.,119,,
463,0.97,4091.587,4100.696,Thank you for validating that it does seem counter intuitive . does that many then that you will come back after the potential legislation comes to us in third quarter.,119,,
464,0.97,4100.763,4116.545,After something is passed to update the rules again?,119,,
465,0.97,4116.879,4117.446,Right.,120,,
466,0.97,4117.513,4118.18,Yes.,120,,
467,0.97,4118.247,4126.822,"You know, then clarifying current code, it will be an exercise that requires directors rules updates.",120,,
468,0.97,4126.889,4145.541,Your question and it speaks to the fact that code changes and legislation are sometimes a blunt tool that can take time to implement.,121,,
469,0.97,4145.608,4191.053,"It also highlights the fact it continues to do work regarding tree protections, including what we spoke about earlier with improved enforcement . So there is a process of continuing to increase tree protections in our city as we move forward to the tree ordinance, pro vying the development capacity we need to house everyone in our city, both of these things have to continue happening long after a tree protection ordinance is passed.",121,,
470,0.97,4191.12,4191.32,Right.,122,,
471,0.97,4191.387,4196.392,If I may I just want to keep close to the team.,122,,
472,0.97,4196.458,4232.094,"I know a lot of people feel that until these are updated, there is not much being done . But I want to give Kudos to the team, because they have done an enormous amount of training so that their staff as they are inspecting are much better able to determine what needs to be done when there are trees present and also provide this had penalty.",122,,
473,0.97,4232.161,4243.172,That also is thanks to also they added highly experienced Arborists.,122,,
474,0.97,4243.238,4267.83,So I just I know that the end we are putting our eyes on the end results.,122,,
475,0.97,4267.896,4268.831,Any further this ate Tem?,123,,
476,0.97,4268.897,4272.401,I want to raise all the work you have done for many years.,123,,
477,0.97,4272.468,4272.801,Thank you.,124,,
478,0.97,4272.868,4275.337,You are an to our community.,125,,
479,0.97,4275.404,4276.338,Thank you so much.,126,,
480,0.97,4276.405,4279.241,Just really want to you.,127,,
481,0.97,4279.308,4292.521,"Thank you all, I feel very proud of the work that the city is doing and will continue to do and I want to thank you all for your support . Thank you.",128,,
482,0.97,4292.588,4307.87,"Moving on to our agenda item for the day, our final agenda item is a briefing on permitting process and review times.",129,,
483,0.97,4307.936,4312.574,Item 3. Seattle of construction.,130,,
484,0.97,4312.641,4313.709,Sections permitting report.,130,,
485,0.97,4313.776,4314.076,Thank you.,131,,
486,0.97,4314.143,4321.984,"We had this scheduled, to be heard in commit tea two weeks ago.",131,,
487,0.97,4322.051,4323.652,And were delayed.,132,,
488,0.97,4323.719,4348.243,"Andy, I hope you can give me feedback on my white board exercise where I tried to memorize your presentation . The report is in response to a statement of legislative intent that Council adopted last year, requiring quarterly reports following this preliminary report X for the viewing public to understand.",132,,
489,0.97,4348.31,4356.318,"Creating a permitting process, improving the permitting process for the city of Seattle is something I'm keenly interested in.",132,,
490,0.97,4356.385,4359.488,I'm excited to hear this report today.,132,,
491,0.97,4359.555,4370.032,"And as I spoke to the director yesterday, I'll likely be following up with a meat not guilty between these quarterly reports just focused strictly on permitting.",132,,
492,0.97,4370.099,4371.667,And then may have some more public discussions.,132,,
493,0.97,4371.734,4380.576,"So that by the time we get to the budget season, we have budget actions that we will be looking forward to taking to . help the Department.",132,,
494,0.97,4380.642,4385.848,If the ways that they need to be successful.,132,,
495,0.97,4385.914,4400.829,"So today, we are joined by the director as well as Andy Higgins, both of Seattle Department of construction and inspection.",132,,
496,0.97,4400.896,4427.356,"Thank you, I'm going to share my screen . can Y'all see that?",133,,
497,0.97,4427.422,4427.656,Excellent.,133,,
498,0.97,4427.723,4450.846,"So the purpose is to help people build a safe, livable and inclusive Seattle and just a reminder of our values, equity, we lead with race and look at permitting through the race and social justice lens . and our other values are respect, quality and integrity and service.",133,,
499,0.97,4450.913,4462.691,"Most poem are familiar with our Perm Pitting and our design review program, but also a reminder of the public that we are also involved in code development.",133,,
500,0.97,4462.758,4472.601,"Code enforcement, we do a lot to help our rental and landlord community and we do a lot of community engagement.",133,,
501,0.97,4472.668,4477.005,So let's talk about the permitting system.,133,,
502,0.97,4477.072,4480.042,So we have two overlapping permitting processes.,133,,
503,0.97,4480.108,4488.917,"There is the master use permit process, and the construction permit process.",133,,
504,0.97,4488.984,4498.126,"And during a very aggressive margin, when people are trying to get housing built as quickly as possible, these two processes tend to overlap and happen at the same time.",133,,
505,0.97,4498.193,4516.178,The key here is that the master use permit or the land use application has to come in first.,133,,
506,0.97,4516.245,4543.639,"The applicant has the option of going through the permit first and then applying for construction permit and that is up to the applicant how they want to sequence their permits . Most types of our permit reviews are coordinated through our software system, and there are many review locations within as you can see on this power point slide.",133,,
507,0.97,4543.705,4574.703,"I just want to point out that, depending on the type of permit, many other city departments also review permit applications and this can be public utilities, city light, housing, it really depends on the tape of permit and the complexity of the permit . There are additional development approvals as part of machine getting a permit that are outside of our system.",133,,
508,0.97,4574.77,4585.681,Examples of this include light Hack UPS from Seattle city light that would have occurred after we have issued a building permit.,133,,
509,0.97,4585.747,4600.028,"Street use permits from s DOT, Plum approvals from King County, and special event permits processed by the office of economic development.",133,,
510,0.97,4600.095,4619.081,"So why are we integrating our permit system across the city? the key here is that, for the applicant, all transactions and applications can occur in one place, be available 24/7 and that the applicant only has to do one sign on.",133,,
511,0.97,4619.147,4624.653,And the tool for the applicant here is that they have a to-do list.,133,,
512,0.97,4624.72,4636.164,They have a shopping cart where they can pay their different permits and they have Remall reminders they have a common scheduling tool.,133,,
513,0.97,4636.231,4644.606,So a recent example of this is that street use just migrated into the system.,133,,
514,0.97,4644.673,4663.525,"This provides for better data sharing across departments, better reporting and performance Metrics and it is much ease we are to integrate with the city a GIS systems and others within the city, for example, summit.",133,,
515,0.97,4663.592,4671.833,"So the old system, which was Hanson, we Transitioned in 2008.",133,,
516,0.97,4671.9,4673.535,The old system involved applicants bringing in paper plan sets.,133,,
517,0.97,4673.602,4683.211,This created a are the of challenges because staff had to manually move plan SETS from one location to another.,133,,
518,0.97,4683.278,4688.95,It really limited our ability to track milestone data.,133,,
519,0.97,4689.017,4692.12,"And sometimes, frankly, paper copies would get lost.",133,,
520,0.97,4692.187,4704.666,"With this, everything is done electronically, and it is automated and it allows for us to track much greater level of data.",133,,
521,0.97,4704.733,4717.712,"And during the Covid-19 pandemic, having completely electronic system has been a Lifesaver, where our staff, a lot of our staff are able to work remotely and continue to review Perm pits.",133,,
522,0.97,4717.779,4729.391,"And just one project that is currently in the works that is going to improve the permitting process, for applicants and staff alike and the blue beam project.",133,,
523,0.97,4729.458,4771.199,"This is a new software that allows Realtime collaboration between staff and project architects and applicants . They are able to look at a screen at the same time and make corrections in Realtime . This is a partial Rollout and we are hoping that full Rollout will occur later this summer . and we have seen other jurisdiction that have adopted blue beam C, significant reductions in the cycles . later on in the presentation this morning I'll talk about correction cycles.",133,,
524,0.97,4771.266,4780.575,Just want to talk some of the additional permitting support that SD Ci is providing.,134,,
525,0.97,4780.642,4785.013,It has a small business liaison that helps support small business permitting.,134,,
526,0.97,4785.08,4797.292,"We know this is more crucial than ever, as small businesses are struggling during Covid-19 and we want to make sure some of these empty store fronts that small businesses can occupy these spaces.",134,,
527,0.97,4797.359,4818.113,"Our goal here is to reduce the permitting type for small businesses by 30% and the key goal is to talk to the small business owners before they sign that lease, so they know what some of the permitting issues are for that space . So we work closely with the office of economic development on these issues.",134,,
528,0.97,4818.18,4823.084,We also have an arts liaison that helps support art related permitting projects.,134,,
529,0.97,4823.151,4833.995,"Again, working with those art uses before they sign that lease.",134,,
530,0.97,4834.062,4837.532,"Finally, affordable housing . We Prioritize all affordable housing applications.",134,,
531,0.97,4837.599,4851.413,"The Mayor announced permanent supportive housing funding round last August that involved six projects and we have a monthly Id t, made up of all those project applicants, staff and staff from other departments, including King County.",134,,
532,0.97,4851.479,4859.621,And we go over every one of those projects on a monthly basis and solve problems in that meeting.,134,,
533,0.97,4859.688,4879.841,Also wanted to emphasize that we now have the 10 standard plans for detached accessory dwelling students to help shorten that permitting tame . The projected permitting time now if someone chooses a standard plan is two to six weeks to get that permit processed.,134,,
534,0.97,4879.908,4900.462,We are actively monitoring these applications and we currently have 17 in the system and we hope to get a lot more soon.,134,,
535,0.97,4900.528,4931.092,Some of the key take Aways up front is that it is meeting many but not all of our permitting goals.,134,,
536,0.97,4931.159,4934.696,We received Farer master use permits in 2020.,134,,
537,0.97,4934.763,4938.333,We have received fewer permit applications in 2020.,134,,
538,0.97,4938.4,4949.344,But the estimated dollar value of those building permits has spiked significantly.,134,,
539,0.97,4949.411,4970.532,And this is the new standards went into effect on March 15th . So we saw a huge surge of high value permits come in so they could vest before those new regulations went into of course.,134,,
540,0.97,4970.598,4975.837,Our spending a shorter percentage that have time and the same is true for master use permits.,134,,
541,0.97,4975.904,4987.849,In a further slide we'll talk a little bit more about why that is.,134,,
542,0.97,4987.916,4997.992,Despite review time and the number of review Seeingles has been fairly consistent.,134,,
543,0.97,4998.059,5008.703,Our goal is to reduce the number of review cycles.,134,,
544,0.97,5008.77,5016.511,Construction permits now need more review cycles before they can issue over half.,134,,
545,0.97,5016.578,5020.815,So that is something we need to focus on as a testimony.,134,,
546,0.97,5020.882,5031.226,"This chart shows the number of permits issued over type . You can see this is not based on dollar value, but on number of permits.",134,,
547,0.97,5031.292,5042.604,You can see the high volumes over the last five years and you can see the recession in 2009 and 2010.,134,,
548,0.97,5048.476,5061.022,"A similar graphic, again you can see the recession back in 2009 and 2010 and the boom we have seen in the past years.",134,,
549,0.97,5061.089,5065.293,"So this graph shows construction permit applications, over time.",135,,
550,0.97,5065.36,5072.667,"Again this is not the master use permit, but the actual building permits.",135,,
551,0.97,5072.734,5077.472,"The key thing here, is to focus on the green bars.",135,,
552,0.97,5077.539,5096.524,"And that is the value of all those projects coming in . and you can see in 2020, a huge increase in the overall value of those permits coming in . You know, a little bit of a decrease in 2020, but again the value of those permits significant.",135,,
553,0.97,5096.591,5110.472,"Again a lot of big projects coming in to vest before the new technical code went into effect, which happened on March 15th.",135,,
554,0.97,5110.538,5116.945,So this chart shows the share of total review time for permits.,135,,
555,0.97,5117.011,5123.751,We have divided this into simple and medium construction permits.,135,,
556,0.97,5123.818,5143.805,"This tends to be minor tenant improvements, alterations, and then your more complex traditional construction permits, this is new buildings, large tenant improvements . and the black line on the top shows the percentage of time that the permit is in the hands.",135,,
557,0.97,5143.872,5165.293,"But as you can see from the bar charts, which is in the blue and then the Orange, that is the total number of days that that permit is in the system . So permits are taking longer to get through the Department, but the percentage of time that that is in its hands has actually decreased.",135,,
558,0.97,5165.36,5170.331,"And we'll talk a little bit more about that, in a slide coming up.",135,,
559,0.97,5174.035,5186.014,"So similar type of chart but this is for the master use permits, the land use process . and again, this is from 2007 to 2020.",135,,
560,0.97,5186.08,5196.19,"And you can see back in the recession just a percentage of time went way up, that was, of course, after we had to do all the staff layoffs.",135,,
561,0.97,5249.243,5254.515,Reduce the number of use cycles.,135,,
562,0.97,5254.582,5269.364,"Again, very similar chart this time for master use.",135,,
563,0.97,5277.772,5280.775,This is for permits.,136,,
564,0.97,5280.842,5296.758,"Again, the permits, our goal as a Department is that 95.",136,,
565,0.97,5305.333,5307.935,Permit 12-Week time.,137,,
566,0.97,5308.002,5308.736,2019 through 2020.,137,,
567,0.97,5308.803,5313.741,End of 2020.,137,,
568,0.97,5313.808,5320.515,We improved pretty significantly.,137,,
569,0.97,5320.581,5329.857,This had to do we're addressing.,138,,
570,0.97,5329.924,5337.699,"And also, a few other choke points in other city departments . and the next slide.",138,,
571,0.97,5337.765,5342.67,Just can show you.,138,,
572,0.97,5342.737,5352.947,The number.,138,,
573,0.97,5354.215,5356.918,Technical codes,139,,
574,0.97,5356.984,5359.787,There's a steep curve for industry.,140,,
575,0.97,5359.854,5360.855,And also SCI staff.,140,,
576,0.97,5360.922,5367.795,"We have seen in some instances, a lower quality of submitted plans.",140,,
577,0.97,5367.862,5370.098,From the private sector.,140,,
578,0.97,5370.164,5371.999,It is extremely busy.,140,,
579,0.97,5372.066,5376.738,And we have seen some applicants from out of town that aren't as familiar with regulations.,140,,
580,0.97,5376.804,5386.781,And we've also had a lot of new city staff come on board . So it takes time to train them . and to educate them.,140,,
581,0.97,5386.848,5397.959,"One thing I want to stress is when those corrections go back to the applicant, and they come back in, they don't go to the bottom of the Cue.",140,,
582,0.97,5398.025,5406.934,They don't have to wait the same amount of time as when they first came in to our system.,140,,
583,0.97,5407.001,5422.55,"We have been very aggressively hiring additional staff through contingent, budget authority . The budget office has been very supportive of us doing that . those are term limited positions.",140,,
584,0.97,5422.617,5430.725,But people who fill those positions are very competitive when there is an opening in our Department.,140,,
585,0.97,5430.792,5438.9,And those people in the term limited positions are very competitive to then take permanent jobs.,140,,
586,0.97,5438.966,5439.333,So that's helpful.,140,,
587,0.97,5439.4,5454.715,"And also, the fire Department that we work very closely with they had staff leave, but again, we are able to work very quickly with the budget office to fill those positions as well.",140,,
588,0.97,5454.782,5460.788,The fire Department is important review as part of that permitting process.,140,,
589,0.97,5460.855,5473.601,So just looking forward to 2021 and our permitting priorities . We want to carry forward some of the best practices that we have been able to adopt during Covid.,140,,
590,0.97,5473.668,5478.239,And one of the things we're looking at is a virtual applicant center.,140,,
591,0.97,5478.306,5495.89,Obviously we will reopen our applicant service center . But we know that it is not always easy for people to take a bus or get in a car and come downtown during their busy day . So we are working on virtual component right now.,140,,
592,0.97,5495.957,5500.228,A lot of the communication has been through E-mail.,140,,
593,0.97,5500.294,5500.661,And electronically.,140,,
594,0.97,5500.728,5516.477,"But we want to be able to adopt a component, where people can chat in real L time, about their applications and ask questions and of course, we continue to have meetings with applicants.",140,,
595,0.97,5516.544,5523.05,"We're also looking at In-Person services at Nondowntown locations, we've had preliminary discussions with Seattle public library.",140,,
596,0.97,5523.117,5528.189,"And also, looking at some of our neighborhood service centers.",140,,
597,0.97,5528.256,5536.497,"And we also look forward to resuming all of our standard services, including In-Home inspections.",140,,
598,0.97,5536.564,5541.002,"We do, do emergency rental housing inspections.",140,,
599,0.97,5541.068,5547.108,But a lot of our sort of routine in House inspections have been put on hold.,140,,
600,0.97,5547.174,5550.578,Because of Covid.,140,,
601,0.97,5550.645,5556.784,"However, construction inspections and our annual elevator and boiler inspections, we have been able to resume.",140,,
602,0.97,5556.851,5562.023,So that's definitely good news . As we articulated in this presentation.,140,,
603,0.97,5562.089,5571.699,We'll continue to work on streamlining our Permitprocesses and make reductions in our permitting times.,140,,
604,0.97,5571.766,5579.34,"And you know, we're working to create that governing system model, with Seattle I.T.",140,,
605,0.97,5579.407,5580.341,To improve that customer experience.,140,,
606,0.97,5580.408,5588.516,And that has to do with the permit system integration effort that I talked about as more departments get on board with excel.,140,,
607,0.97,5588.582,5598.559,That concludes my presentation . and Andy Higgins and I are happy to take questions.,140,,
608,0.97,5598.626,5600.795,"Well, thank you, Torgleson.",141,,
609,0.97,5600.861,5603.03,I do have a number of questions.,141,,
610,0.97,5603.097,5606.2,Do want to just check with colleagues.,141,,
611,0.97,5606.267,5611.105,And I'll circle back to some of the slides.,141,,
612,0.97,5611.172,5614.241,So having that presentation up will be helpful.,141,,
613,0.97,5614.308,5614.842,Okay.,142,,
614,0.97,5614.909,5616.344,Should I keep it up?,142,,
615,0.97,5616.41,5617.878,Yeah.,143,,
616,0.97,5617.945,5618.379,That would be helpful.,143,,
617,0.97,5618.446,5623.617,"I see Councilman Louis might have a question, vice chairman Mosqueda.",143,,
618,0.97,5623.684,5630.791,"And Andy, do you want to provide us additional context before we launch into questions?",143,,
619,0.97,5630.858,5633.06,"No, I think it very well [inaudible]",144,,
620,0.97,5633.127,5633.327,Great.,145,,
621,0.97,5633.394,5640.368,"And your Audio is a little low . So when we do get to your section, just highlighting that.",145,,
622,0.97,5640.434,5640.835,Councilmember Louis.,145,,
623,0.97,5640.901,5645.506,Questions?,145,,
624,0.97,5645.573,5647.808,Yes.,146,,
625,0.97,5647.875,5648.275,Director Torgleson.,146,,
626,0.97,5648.342,5648.542,Briefly.,146,,
627,0.97,5648.609,5653.314,It's sort of related but sort of outside the confines of your presentation.,146,,
628,0.97,5653.381,5654.015,Unless I missed it.,146,,
629,0.97,5654.081,5654.448,I'm just curious.,146,,
630,0.97,5654.515,5659.854,We talked a lot about how the work load has been and the Metrics for processing the mud permits.,146,,
631,0.97,5659.92,5664.992,Can you comment at all on the volume of permitting that we have been seeing through the Covid period.,146,,
632,0.97,5665.059,5668.195,People that are applying to build things.,146,,
633,0.97,5668.262,5671.932,"People that are applying to, you know, open businesses . In Seattle.",146,,
634,0.97,5671.999,5678.606,"And there's been a lot of speculation in the media that you know, but for the grace of God.",146,,
635,0.97,5678.672,5685.112,"We're going to lose every single thing in Seattle, develop.",146,,
636,0.97,5685.179,5694.822,"Including our Mayor, apparently, according to Danny Westne's column about Gary Locke potentially running . But I'm curious about what we're seeing in terms of inflow.",146,,
637,0.97,5694.889,5698.492,Of one of the biggest Metrics of economic strength.,146,,
638,0.97,5698.559,5701.462,"Which is, are people building here?",146,,
639,0.97,5701.529,5704.365,Are people applying for permit to use spaces.,146,,
640,0.97,5704.432,5707.768,I'm curious to what we've seen throughout the unique Covid period.,146,,
641,0.97,5707.835,5714.375,So we have seen a decline in the number of master use applications.,147,,
642,0.97,5714.442,5715.776,The land use permits.,147,,
643,0.97,5715.843,5718.879,And the number of building permits coming in.,147,,
644,0.97,5718.946,5725.653,"As I did mention, the value of those building permits that came in, at least at the beginning of the year.",147,,
645,0.97,5725.719,5740.367,Has been significant and much higher than the past two years . One trend that we are seeing is that a lot of applicants have made their way all the way through the building permit process.,147,,
646,0.97,5740.434,5745.573,But have not paid their final fees and picked up their building permit.,147,,
647,0.97,5745.639,5758.619,I think that is because people are waiting for us to get out of Covid and see what the market does.,147,,
648,0.97,5758.686,5760.254,Waiting to get issued.,147,,
649,0.97,5760.321,5765.726,And we're waiting for those final fees.,147,,
650,0.97,5765.793,5773.501,Have not seen a decrease in the number of Applicaions coming in.,148,,
651,0.97,5773.567,5779.14,Even though the new technical codes and energy code have gone into effect.,148,,
652,0.97,5779.206,5789.116,We still have plenty of applicants coming in to Plyapply.,148,,
653,0.97,5789.183,5790.951,& GT;,149,,
654,0.97,5791.018,5803.831,"The number of permits coming in has, you know, we've seen a significant number of building permits . and the value of those permits is huge.",150,,
655,0.97,5803.898,5808.435,To add to of the coded option on the 15th of March.,151,,
656,0.97,5808.502,5814.441,"We saw, I think we took in $1.1 billion in construction value just in the first two weeks of March.",151,,
657,0.97,5814.508,5819.213,"And already to this year, we're already over $2 billion in construction value.",151,,
658,0.97,5819.28,5824.985,Projected out for what we have scheduled.,151,,
659,0.97,5825.052,5830.124,Already just through July scheduling will already be over $4 billion for the year.,151,,
660,0.97,5830.191,5832.826,Not even Coulding for what could happen for July.,151,,
661,0.97,5832.893,5834.662,We are confident it is Cueing up.,151,,
662,0.97,5834.728,5836.63,There's a lot of applications coming in the door.,151,,
663,0.97,5836.697,5843.637,"Just for example, earlier this week, I was coaching an applicant on how to keep their application alive.",151,,
664,0.97,5843.704,5844.471,For the two-year period.,151,,
665,0.97,5844.538,5855.015,An application can stay alive . They're questioning funding mechanisms now.,151,,
666,0.97,5855.082,5871.899,"And as soon as they're able to get funding in place, they'll want to move forward and Proeed with those settlements that they've already acquired what they were doing is responding to every correction . SOY when they're ready to get it.",151,,
667,0.97,5871.966,5874.301,They can respond and finish the processing permit.,151,,
668,0.97,5874.368,5882.243,"And frankly, that's part of what we're seeing in the overall time join lines Nathan was showing earlier.",151,,
669,0.97,5882.309,5885.713,You'll notice there is an intake.,151,,
670,0.97,5885.779,5888.749,But it is only a portion of that.,151,,
671,0.97,5888.816,5902.796,"It checked out the applicant for other portions of that . and the Iteration between cycles is extensive because applicants are holding onto the life of their application as long as they can, because they know when the permit issued, the permit itself is only good for 18 months.",151,,
672,0.97,5902.863,5912.973,"So they can renew it, as long as they're making significant construction activity . actual and they don't have to Reviseit to current code.",151,,
673,0.97,5913.04,5924.151,"But if they get a permit issued and it goes 18 Montes and they haven't started construction yet, they have to revise it . It's really a kind of timing game now.",151,,
674,0.97,5924.218,5930.758,Lot of these applications . They apply for the permit . that's the strategy.,151,,
675,0.97,5930.824,5934.762,Now they're holding on until they can get the timing in place.,151,,
676,0.97,5934.828,5939.3,And we predict that there's going to be a mass of permits issued.,151,,
677,0.97,5939.366,5945.873,And real burden on our staff . to try to keep the inspections going.,151,,
678,0.97,5945.939,5946.24,Going forward.,151,,
679,0.97,5946.307,5947.241,That's something we're definitely looking at.,151,,
680,0.97,5947.308,5948.375,Can I briefly ask.,152,,
681,0.97,5948.442,5953.314,"I mean, related to that.",152,,
682,0.97,5953.38,5966.126,"You know, the Mha implications . in terms of fees coming on the door for what we're seeing . and also, the implications of staffing and SD Ci.",152,,
683,0.97,5966.193,5970.097,To be able to realize those M.H.A.,152,,
684,0.97,5970.164,5970.331,Gains.,152,,
685,0.97,5970.397,5975.803,Faster and get that money out the door to help with our social housing deficit.,152,,
686,0.97,5975.869,5983.444,Anyone want to touch on that.,152,,
687,0.97,5983.51,5991.952,That is something to attention to.,153,,
688,0.97,5992.019,5994.321,Council member Louis had an important issue.,153,,
689,0.97,5994.388,5998.192,That I need to circle back with the office on housing on.,153,,
690,0.97,5998.258,6015.476,"And a policy to note on that, too, is that during Covid, that two-year life of an application, there's a provision in the building code that says if there is a circumstance outside of the applicant's control, we have the ability to send the application life.",154,,
691,0.97,6015.542,6019.313,And we've actually said Covid is outside an applicant.,154,,
692,0.97,6019.38,6022.85,There is a number in the system longer than that three-year period now.,154,,
693,0.97,6022.916,6032.593,"And we have told the public that we have not started Proactively canceling those, until at least the end of the Mayor's executive order or emergency order.",154,,
694,0.97,6032.659,6036.13,And we would give at least 30 days of code minimum.,154,,
695,0.97,6036.196,6042.002,But 30 to 60 days notice before we start actively.,154,,
696,0.97,6042.069,6052.613,To try to start to Incentivize them issuing.,154,,
697,0.97,6052.679,6054.348,Really appreciate diligent work.,155,,
698,0.97,6054.415,6061.755,And our road to recovery . It's going to go through SD Ci . in a lot of respects.,155,,
699,0.97,6061.822,6075.436,"I wouldn't--I wouldn't bet on anything to come on the other end and come out, it's no small part due to your diligence and professionalism.",155,,
700,0.97,6075.502,6075.903,Thank you so much.,155,,
701,0.97,6075.969,6077.838,Thank you.,156,,
702,0.97,6077.905,6084.645,Thank you so Louis.,157,,
703,0.97,6084.711,6086.814,Vice chair Mosqueda.,157,,
704,0.97,6086.88,6090.017,"Thank you very much, chair.",158,,
705,0.97,6090.083,6101.695,"Thanks for the presentation . good to see you both again . I appreciate the presentation . I think in a time of Covid, everybody is doing the best they can to both work from home and do the inspections out in the field to the degree that they're safe.",158,,
706,0.97,6101.762,6123.484,"Trying to do some of those basic operations has been sort of first priority and appreciate that you showed what I took away from it is that their hasn't been a dramatic increase in the amount of time . In fact, I think what you are really trying to emphasize is that SD Ci hasn't increased that much.",158,,
707,0.97,6123.55,6136.597,"But what I hear, Anecdotally is that there are significant concerns, especially with complex, the mitigation housing.",158,,
708,0.97,6136.663,6139.8,And spending way longer than the 180 days.,158,,
709,0.97,6139.867,6146.24,But we don't think there is a huge increase and percentage of time that it takes for permits to be allocated.,158,,
710,0.97,6146.306,6153.447,I think the bigger question I'm hearing from folks around the community is what can we do to draw down those numbers?,158,,
711,0.97,6153.514,6156.25,How can we make this happen much faster?,158,,
712,0.97,6156.316,6162.689,Especially when we realize the consequence of Covid is manifesting itself in the street with more people living outside.,158,,
713,0.97,6162.756,6168.629,I want us to be building housing of all types as fast as we possibly can can.,158,,
714,0.97,6168.695,6175.435,"And some of that is Obviouslystrateg IC acquisition, which I have been a strong supporter of.",158,,
715,0.97,6175.502,6186.847,But we need to build housing . This is not just converting existing units into affordable structures and more preventing those structures from being demolished.,158,,
716,0.97,6186.914,6194.488,"This is about building, building, building, more affordable housing, more mixed income housing.",158,,
717,0.97,6194.555,6197.391,Can you talk a little more about what we are doing to make it better.,158,,
718,0.97,6197.457,6207.401,And how we can make sure that this is complementary to the permanent supportive housing we just passed?,158,,
719,0.97,6207.467,6210.037,We have heard a lot about costs associated there.,158,,
720,0.97,6210.103,6213.04,And the increased time is money.,158,,
721,0.97,6213.106,6220.013,"And when there's increased time, that's also a cost in terms of potential lost opportunities for people to live inside.",158,,
722,0.97,6220.08,6222.816,"And during a pandemic, that's potential cost in terms of lives.",158,,
723,0.97,6222.883,6229.122,So can you talk a little more . Thank you for not having a presentation that talked about the increase in time.,158,,
724,0.97,6229.189,6237.731,But how can woo Tumly draw down that time to address this crisis with real urgency?,158,,
725,0.97,6237.798,6239.566,"Thank you, Mosqueda.",159,,
726,0.97,6239.633,6244.438,"I fully recognize, we do need to improve the mass use permitting times.",159,,
727,0.97,6244.504,6260.687,"I want to thank the Council and Councilmember Louis for leading the permanent support of housing legislation, which for that type of housing construction, will significantly improve permitting times.",159,,
728,0.97,6260.754,6279.94,"One of the things that we're very hopeful about is that blue beam software, where the applicant and Sdci staff can do corrections to Realtime, which will reduce that leg time . I think that is super important.",159,,
729,0.97,6280.007,6290.717,And there are--one of the challenges we have is that a fair number of mass use permits are getting appealed to the hearing Examiner.,159,,
730,0.97,6290.784,6291.184,The hearing Examiner.,159,,
731,0.97,6291.251,6293.82,I don't want to throw them under the bus.,159,,
732,0.97,6293.887,6318.679,"But given their backlog, you know, there are three or four months backed up right now . So any additional support, the hearing Examiner can get to get to these appeals faster, will also help our housing industry . so they can get those projects constructed.",159,,
733,0.97,6318.745,6321.481,Vice chairman,160,,
734,0.97,6321.548,6327.387,"Thank you very much, chair.",161,,
735,0.97,6327.454,6328.488,"Thank you for that, director Targleson.",161,,
736,0.97,6328.555,6331.191,So any additional support we can offer to the hearing Examiner.,161,,
737,0.97,6331.258,6340.5,Can you tell me what that mean? do we need to waive something temporarily as we look to revitalize our local economy? does that mean funding?,161,,
738,0.97,6340.567,6344.571,I don't want to put you in a corner to talk about funding from the Department to the Council.,161,,
739,0.97,6344.638,6346.907,But I think we need all ideas on the table.,161,,
740,0.97,6346.973,6366.326,"And happy to make sure that we're providing necessary support to hearing Examiner . But much like We've done with other permitting changes in the last year, to make it more possible for our community to continue to interact.",161,,
741,0.97,6366.393,6367.828,To have outdoor eating opportunities.,161,,
742,0.97,6367.894,6375.902,"To provide curb side spaces for innovative strategies to address the crisis that Covid has imposed on our community, this feels very similar.",161,,
743,0.97,6375.969,6385.979,And I just feel like we ought to be thinking of any outside of the box strategies to both help Sdci and the hearing Examiner.,161,,
744,0.97,6386.046,6392.819,"Is there something that we could do if you had a magic wand, is there a specific code, outside of revenue?",161,,
745,0.97,6392.886,6398.725,"And we have revenue coming . We have Federal support coming . after a long, long four years . We have funding coming.",161,,
746,0.97,6398.792,6404.331,"And after a long year of Covid, impacts manifesting itself on the street.",161,,
747,0.97,6404.397,6406.566,We have some relief on the horizon.,161,,
748,0.97,6406.633,6418.612,"Not only that, we have jump start progressive revenue that includes a significant portion, Iment to say, 10 to 15 million for economic revitalization.",161,,
749,0.97,6418.678,6427.22,"And some of that, must also include how we get people out of their neighborhoods, out of their homes, interacting with the local economy and allowing for that type of development to happen.",161,,
750,0.97,6427.287,6433.627,"Which means to me, we gotTA be building that, Asap.",161,,
751,0.97,6433.693,6443.804,"If you had a magic wand, is there a way for us to act on the greater call and permitting process, to expedite that?",161,,
752,0.97,6443.87,6444.07,Sure.,162,,
753,0.97,6444.137,6451.344,Number 1 is I talked Tocouncilmember Strass about this yesterday.,162,,
754,0.97,6451.411,6467.527,"We are being looking at emergent, possible emergency legislation to allow for more flexibility for retail fronts . So we can get neighborhoods occupied with vibrant industries.",162,,
755,0.97,6467.594,6471.731,We have pretty strict criteria in the code as to what types of businesses can occupy those spaces.,162,,
756,0.97,6471.798,6479.94,And I think it's time to allow for some more flexibility so we can get more Street-Level and pedestrian activation.,162,,
757,0.97,6480.006,6491.852,I'd be happy to have a side bar discussion with hearing Examiner about what ideas they might have to improve the leg time.,162,,
758,0.97,6491.918,6493.587,I know they're extremely busy right now.,162,,
759,0.97,6493.653,6500.961,There have been a lot of Appeals of project decisions that we have issued.,162,,
760,0.97,6501.027,6510.704,"I think a lot of people are home right now, during the pandemic, and are experiencing construction impacts, so that is something that I'll have to take into consideration.",162,,
761,0.97,6510.77,6519.846,But we are open to any ideas that you have to improve the permitting processing time . especially master use permits.,162,,
762,0.97,6519.913,6520.547,Wonderful.,163,,
763,0.97,6520.614,6525.085,"If I can add to I mean, obviously it comes down to resources as well.",164,,
764,0.97,6525.151,6528.521,And I'm not going to ask for resources for staffing.,164,,
765,0.97,6528.588,6531.591,But defining what good looks like.,164,,
766,0.97,6531.658,6534.094,And what that applicable turnaround should be.,164,,
767,0.97,6534.16,6538.365,Helps us define what resources we would need to achieve those goals.,164,,
768,0.97,6538.431,6543.603,"So if our current goals aren't, even though we're meeting the majority of them for the most part.",164,,
769,0.97,6543.67,6547.874,"If they're not good enough, then we need to know what good enough looks like.",164,,
770,0.97,6547.941,6550.277,So we can address what the resource needs to be.,164,,
771,0.97,6550.343,6551.945,And to add to that.,164,,
772,0.97,6552.012,6554.347,We also have a number.,164,,
773,0.97,6554.414,6558.618,We're dedicated to the user experience.,164,,
774,0.97,6558.685,6563.623,So we're actively pursuing continuous improvement with the customer first perspective in mind.,164,,
775,0.97,6563.69,6572.232,"So we already have an outside consultant agency, working on portal improvements for improving the flow of how things work in there.",164,,
776,0.97,6572.299,6573.033,So it's more intuitive.,164,,
777,0.97,6573.099,6582.542,And as more and more departments come on board . Seattle I. it is really being burdened with a lot of requests for improvements to our technology system.,164,,
778,0.97,6582.609,6591.584,"And Unfortunately, it has become somewhat of a bottleneck in terms of us being able to achieve Thetechnology on a platform wide level.",164,,
779,0.97,6591.651,6594.22,And having ability to actually increase our I.T.,164,,
780,0.97,6594.287,6595.055,Capacity.,164,,
781,0.97,6595.121,6609.269,To be able to support some of these continued automation and work flow in enhancements . and work flow Integrations . those kind of things would also be extremely valuable in helping us achieve those faster.,164,,
782,0.97,6609.336,6612.572,We have a very use code.,165,,
783,0.97,6612.639,6621.247,"It's over a thousand pages . and it keeps getting longer . So I mean, one of my dreams is land use code reform.",165,,
784,0.97,6621.314,6626.186,To make the land use code easier for applicants and for staff.,165,,
785,0.97,6626.252,6631.291,"And for the community at large, to understand how zoning works in the city.",165,,
786,0.97,6631.358,6634.294,"Well, thank you much.",166,,
787,0.97,6634.361,6644.971,"You both touched on issues that I also would like to follow up with you on the good chair on . Andy, you mentioned, sort of the benchmarks.",166,,
788,0.97,6645.038,6645.472,And director Tolevson.,166,,
789,0.97,6645.538,6651.111,You talked about how you are striving to decrease the weight times.,166,,
790,0.97,6651.177,6665.158,"So I actually look to you to help us understand, what is that threshold, what is your goal should and we can work backwards from there, to see what additional resources or support the city as a whole or the family can provide.",166,,
791,0.97,6665.225,6671.431,But I would like to have a better idea of what your time line is for expediting the permitting process.,166,,
792,0.97,6671.498,6681.674,"And if you could get that back to us, that would be great . I also think that, you know, I don't want to Miss the point about the overall permitting time lines.",166,,
793,0.97,6681.741,6690.85,"I think that's a really big deal now, in having additional conservations about ways that we can address that delay, I think would be incredibly important.",166,,
794,0.97,6690.917,6697.957,Thank you for the work that you're doing on the first floors and sort of the street use level.,166,,
795,0.97,6698.024,6698.191,Ideas.,166,,
796,0.97,6698.258,6700.026,They're excited to work with you on that.,166,,
797,0.97,6700.093,6703.363,It's something that we've talked about for a very long time.,166,,
798,0.97,6703.43,6714.808,"And as you think about more Inteactive uses, one of the things I just want to keep putting on the radar that I know is a priority as well for the chair is how we can create more child care space.",166,,
799,0.97,6714.874,6722.382,We're losing about 7% to 10% of child care facilities that were already in this city before Covid.,166,,
800,0.97,6722.449,6727.821,And we already had child care and extremely high child care costs.,166,,
801,0.97,6727.887,6736.529,"So thinking about how we can get folks out of their homes, one of the things they have to have, is child care.",166,,
802,0.97,6736.596,6739.499,Especially since We've seen record numbers of babies being born in the city.,166,,
803,0.97,6739.566,6753.513,"If you think about, why do folks want to stay in the city when they can work from home . child care, Walkability, hubs, all of this we need.",166,,
804,0.97,6753.58,6760.487,And in terms of reforming our land use code policies.,166,,
805,0.97,6760.553,6762.322,I have a list of ideas.,166,,
806,0.97,6762.388,6766.793,So hopefully we can come together and share those ideas soon.,166,,
807,0.97,6766.86,6768.228,Thank you.,167,,
808,0.97,6768.294,6770.33,Great.,168,,
809,0.97,6770.396,6770.663,Gentlemen.,168,,
810,0.97,6770.73,6777.737,I have a number of questions . and I'd like to refer to the power point.,168,,
811,0.97,6777.804,6778.438,If possible.,168,,
812,0.97,6778.505,6784.744,Just kind of taking a step off vice chair Moskedda'S comments about understanding what the goal is.,168,,
813,0.97,6784.811,6792.552,"I understand, right now, the goal is 120 days to approval . of a permit.",168,,
814,0.97,6792.619,6797.423,"Is that correct, what you told me at the last committee meeting?",168,,
815,0.97,6797.49,6799.559,"That's for, Yeah.",169,,
816,0.97,6799.626,6800.026,Master use permit.,169,,
817,0.97,6800.093,6805.798,And that would be 120 days in Sdci's hands.,169,,
818,0.97,6805.865,6806.266,Got you.,170,,
819,0.97,6806.332,6812.672,So that kind of leads me into another question that I had.,170,,
820,0.97,6812.739,6813.439,Councilmember Straus.,171,,
821,0.97,6813.506,6814.44,Just to add to that.,171,,
822,0.97,6814.507,6818.778,"I believe that was established around 1995, by the state Legislature.",171,,
823,0.97,6818.845,6822.982,"Because back then, we used to not screen applications for quality intake.",171,,
824,0.97,6823.049,6825.785,We used to just take everything in.,171,,
825,0.97,6825.852,6835.094,"And then our initial correction letters would often be, please provide social calculation . please provide lot calculation . that kind of thing.",171,,
826,0.97,6835.161,6838.264,And the bottleneck then was the initial plan review.,171,,
827,0.97,6838.331,6848.541,And it was taken upwards . six month negligence some places to just get the Planreview.,171,,
828,0.97,6848.608,6851.477,That led to the process and land use Inential 2000.,171,,
829,0.97,6851.544,6856.449,We did a whole ton of process Recorporation.,171,,
830,0.97,6856.516,6864.657,"And created our screening, our application screening to raise the level of intake quality . so that that initial review is to complete a full and complete plan review.",171,,
831,0.97,6864.724,6870.33,And only identify the issues that are outstanding not in compliance or potential compliance with code.,171,,
832,0.97,6870.396,6876.669,It's the partnership then at that point that becomes the Back-And-Forthitye rations with applicants.,171,,
833,0.97,6876.736,6880.673,And we only have so much control over how responsive an applicant is.,171,,
834,0.97,6880.74,6886.813,We are really kind of dedicated to time in our hands as much as possible.,171,,
835,0.97,6886.879,6891.851,But total Through-Put time . You often hear a lot of complaints about intake to issue.,171,,
836,0.97,6891.918,6896.656,"And we struggle with that . Because really, we only have certain control of that aspect of time.",171,,
837,0.97,6896.723,6909.435,"We're focused on drilling down, not only on shortening and meeting our own expectations around initial plan review performance.",171,,
838,0.97,6909.502,6911.838,But also Shorteppenning--Shortsdenning our own.,171,,
839,0.97,6911.904,6915.775,But again with clarity of correction.,171,,
840,0.97,6915.842,6917.543,And trying to partner with applicant solutions.,171,,
841,0.97,6917.61,6919.512,We think we have a certain amount of control.,171,,
842,0.97,6919.579,6931.257,"But at the end of the day, we can only provide so much with response to those Cycling . really, our focus to s to eliminate bottlenecks, increase efficiencies.",171,,
843,0.97,6931.324,6937.997,Work with other city departments that also have a stake in each of those review cycles.,171,,
844,0.97,6938.064,6939.399,Because it's not just Sdci reviews.,171,,
845,0.97,6939.465,6942.068,Depending on the scope of the application.,171,,
846,0.97,6942.135,6944.57,It could be multiple permit departments.,171,,
847,0.97,6944.637,6947.907,"It could be parks, fire, city lights.",171,,
848,0.97,6947.974,6952.111,"Et cetera, Pect et cetera . We're focused on that as a key part of that.",171,,
849,0.97,6952.178,6959.952,Making sure that each of those review locations has enough cast in place to deal with the unknown hits.,171,,
850,0.97,6960.019,6962.221,The family medical leave . Somebody out with Covid.,171,,
851,0.97,6962.288,6970.029,"Or if somebody just needing to take a Sabbatical, or those kinds of things, to make sure that that bottleneck doesn't move around.",171,,
852,0.97,6970.096,6978.371,"And that we can better control what the bottleneck is, which we feel should be our ordinance.",171,,
853,0.97,6978.438,6979.238,At least for construction permitting.,171,,
854,0.97,6979.305,6989.716,"The more we can do to partner and have oversight across all of those, the better off it will be in terms of shortening the overall wait time.",172,,
855,0.97,6989.782,6990.783,Great.,173,,
856,0.97,6990.85,6991.918,"Thank you, Andy.",173,,
857,0.97,6991.984,6992.719,That was very helpful.,173,,
858,0.97,6992.785,6995.688,And actually answered a fair number of my questions that I had listed.,173,,
859,0.97,6995.755,7011.337,"And as you may have seen, I tried to pull up the White board that I used last week . It's not working right now . all that to say, I'll try to use my fingers here to Dem straight.",173,,
860,0.97,7011.404,7012.271,You have multiple different touch points.,173,,
861,0.97,7012.338,7020.079,"Or actually, if you could pull up slide 6. that would help this conversation.",173,,
862,0.97,7020.146,7020.68,Yeah.,174,,
863,0.97,7020.747,7029.455,"I think I know what you're getting at, in terms of the way we talk about milestones . where it comes in from an applicant.",174,,
864,0.97,7029.522,7040.7,"It hits a point of intake . and spans out to however many review locations, based on the scope of that application . and once the last one is completed, it comes back to a point, where it checks out to the applicant.",174,,
865,0.97,7040.767,7043.87,And then it sits in the applicant's hands.,174,,
866,0.97,7043.936,7054.113,"And there's an intake point, where we take it back out and fan out to the locations that had corrections outstanding from that initial review cycle . and if they're all able to approve, we're done.",174,,
867,0.97,7054.18,7054.614,We issue the permit.,174,,
868,0.97,7054.68,7060.753,But if any of them have outstanding permit corrections left.,174,,
869,0.97,7060.82,7064.023,It comes back and Outcycles over and over again.,174,,
870,0.97,7064.09,7067.727,"And again, the code revision concept.",174,,
871,0.97,7067.794,7073.466,"The more it is, the simpler it is for an applicant to get to substantial compliance.",174,,
872,0.97,7073.533,7075.701,The more design and nuance and site specific.,174,,
873,0.97,7075.768,7086.679,"And this, that, and the other thing that go on, the more discretion there Sthe more challenge there is for an applicant to really understand the nuances for their given site and scenarios.",174,,
874,0.97,7086.746,7094.454,"So any kind of future revisions to code, really, the more we make it, Design-Specific and discretionary.",174,,
875,0.97,7094.52,7098.524,The more correction cycles tend to occur.,174,,
876,0.97,7098.591,7103.996,Because it's that Back-And- forth of trying to find proper ways to comply.,174,,
877,0.97,7104.063,7105.364,Exactly.,175,,
878,0.97,7105.431,7109.702,Your finger Graphics were better than mine.,175,,
879,0.97,7109.769,7111.871,"Could you pull up slide 6, though.",175,,
880,0.97,7111.938,7113.139,Can you see that?,176,,
881,0.97,7113.206,7113.372,No.,177,,
882,0.97,7113.439,7120.079,I don't think your screen.,178,,
883,0.97,7120.146,7120.346,Rokay.,179,,
884,0.97,7120.413,7130.59,Hold on.,179,,
885,0.97,7131.824,7140.366,There we go.,180,,
886,0.97,7140.433,7140.7,Yep.,181,,
887,0.97,7140.766,7141.067,There we are.,181,,
888,0.97,7141.133,7148.174,What I see here is that it's Sdot's 120-day goal.,181,,
889,0.97,7148.241,7161.988,"It sounds like we need to be better about setting the goal, like vice chairman Mosqueda said.",181,,
890,0.97,7162.054,7165.324,We need to have a goal to work backward from there.,181,,
891,0.97,7165.391,7166.225,And then the graph.,181,,
892,0.97,7166.292,7167.86,And the black.,181,,
893,0.97,7167.927,7170.863,And we don't have to move to that slide quite yet.,181,,
894,0.97,7170.93,7191.617,"But the black line that we saw on slides 17 and 18 of the days that it's in Sdci's hands, can I confirm that this is just in this bucket that says Sdci, as compared to other buckets . is that a correct understanding?",181,,
895,0.97,7191.684,7196.956,I can move to that's helpful.,182,,
896,0.97,7197.023,7197.356,Yes.,183,,
897,0.97,7197.423,7199.125,So this black line.,183,,
898,0.97,7199.191,7207.433,Is that only for SD Ci and other departments are not included in that?,183,,
899,0.97,7207.5,7209.569,I believe it's Sdci.,184,,
900,0.97,7209.635,7210.469,But I will confirm.,184,,
901,0.97,7210.536,7216.375,If you could go back slide 6. I just want to kind of focus in on here.,185,,
902,0.97,7216.442,7232.892,"When we had our conversations, it was important for me to understand that it's not easy to necessarily contract out, to back fill for these positions . because there is--it is technically complex.",185,,
903,0.97,7232.959,7241.1,Their work is technically complex.,185,,
904,0.97,7241.167,7244.337,"Andy, you reality pointed out an important fact to me.",185,,
905,0.97,7244.403,7251.744,"If there is one person missing from a Four-Person team, that reduces the Through-Put by a quarter.",185,,
906,0.97,7251.811,7252.011,Yeah.,186,,
907,0.97,7252.078,7260.286,"If there's one person missing from a 20-Person team, there's not as much impact on that review time.",187,,
908,0.97,7260.353,7268.327,"And as one to--Let's say, there's a four person team that loses one member, it creates a bit of a choke point.",187,,
909,0.97,7268.394,7272.698,And then when they hire that member back.,187,,
910,0.97,7272.765,7276.969,"Then another Node may have similar--I mean, because that's the life cycle of life . right?",187,,
911,0.97,7277.036,7279.405,Things change.,187,,
912,0.97,7279.472,7282.975,"People either need new jobs, retire, what have you.",187,,
913,0.97,7283.042,7316.976,"I guess the point that I'm trying to highlight here is that the choke point that we are trying to solve can oftentimes be a moving target . So this brings me to an understanding of, is there a way that we can create a substitute class or float a float team that is within Sdci that can--and maybe these are the more senior reviewers who possibly have worked on other, in multiple nodes.",187,,
914,0.97,7317.043,7318.277,Is this a credible idea?,187,,
915,0.97,7318.344,7323.416,Or am I thinking of this in too simplistic terms?,187,,
916,0.97,7323.482,7323.683,Yeah.,188,,
917,0.97,7323.749,7331.323,"The challenges that each of the codes, that each of these groups oversees is highly technical.",188,,
918,0.97,7331.39,7340.032,And so to have somebody that can float in between is the challenge.,188,,
919,0.97,7340.099,7342.868,We have a position called a permit process.,188,,
920,0.97,7342.935,7351.21,The original vision was to be able to walk on water.,188,,
921,0.97,7351.277,7354.213,The rat is depth needed.,188,,
922,0.97,7354.28,7362.788,"So really what We've found is that for some of the smaller review groups, where a Four- person theme or Six-Person theme.",188,,
923,0.97,7362.855,7368.928,"And you do lose a major chunk of your capacity, by losing a single individual at any given time.",188,,
924,0.97,7368.994,7374.033,It's really just enough to have any depth there to be able to absorb that hit.,188,,
925,0.97,7374.1,7384.81,"You know, there's vacations and sick leave and other stuff going on in people's lives . So if you try to budget your capacity to your maximum, potentially available.",188,,
926,0.97,7384.877,7390.015,You're really always operating more at 80% capacity instead . Some factor less.,188,,
927,0.97,7390.082,7399.458,It's really about trying to figure out how do we minimize where that bottleneck jumps around.,188,,
928,0.97,7399.525,7410.402,And try to localize it to one or two primary locations . I think our largest teams are really in like zoning and land use discretionary groups and also in our ordinance and structural groups.,188,,
929,0.97,7410.469,7417.443,"And outside of that, the majority of these review locations are small teams . somewhere between 2 and 6 people.",188,,
930,0.97,7417.51,7423.949,"So it's really about, can we get enough layer there to make sure they never become the bottleneck.",188,,
931,0.97,7424.016,7427.153,Even when they do experience a capacity hit for one reason or another.,188,,
932,0.97,7427.219,7440.432,And limit it to those groups where when they take a capacity hit and order structural . It's a much smaller chunk of that.,188,,
933,0.97,7440.499,7441.3,It's really helpful.,189,,
934,0.97,7441.367,7443.936,Sounds like for us to maintain capacity.,189,,
935,0.97,7444.003,7449.575,It's almost as if we need to be hired and staffed at 120% capacity.,189,,
936,0.97,7449.642,7450.075,Exactly.,190,,
937,0.97,7450.142,7457.883,"Because that excess capacity, that excess 20% is really something to just absorb . that you know, when the unknown hits.",190,,
938,0.97,7457.95,7459.785,We always other than there is an unknown.,190,,
939,0.97,7459.852,7462.822,We just don't know what the unknown is going to be.,190,,
940,0.97,7462.888,7476.068,"It's just planning ahead and being Proactive for that . so that in a case like last summer, when one external Department lost a reviewer, your bottleneck doesn't double in a three-month period of time.",190,,
941,0.97,7476.135,7487.012,"We really want to be able Toabsorb a hit like that and be able to go out, recruit and back fill that position and move forward.",190,,
942,0.97,7487.079,7499.325,By training them and bringing them up to a capable reviewer . We talk about it being a year to two years.,190,,
943,0.97,7499.391,7504.63,Someone getting proficient . your comment going to the outside.,190,,
944,0.97,7504.697,7505.664,And utilizing consulting staff . We've done that.,190,,
945,0.97,7505.731,7509.401,We did that back in the Mid2000S.,190,,
946,0.97,7509.468,7511.503,"And the problem was, overseeing the quality of the work.",190,,
947,0.97,7511.57,7514.874,The mistakes we had out of the work.,190,,
948,0.97,7514.94,7517.676,The inconsistencies out of the work.,190,,
949,0.97,7517.743,7522.781,And really just managing and overseeing it was as much work as having another layer or team in place.,190,,
950,0.97,7522.848,7526.185,"So since that time, we've developed a core staffing model.",190,,
951,0.97,7526.252,7534.093,So that we don't have to experience as deep of cuts as we experienced in the last downturn.,190,,
952,0.97,7534.159,7538.197,"So we can have trained, capable, assistant applicable codes all in place, as the economy recovers.",190,,
953,0.97,7538.264,7543.903,"So we can be in front of that economic recovery, rather than chasing it.",190,,
954,0.97,7543.969,7544.436,That's exactly right.,191,,
955,0.97,7544.503,7551.71,And for the other departments . I think I heard you mention inner departmental team.,191,,
956,0.97,7551.777,7566.091,"How--is this something that I, as the chair of the land use committee need to have more intentional oversight to make sure that everyone is--that these teams are being staffed at 120% as well.",191,,
957,0.97,7566.158,7575.868,"I know that the silos of our city government mean that you, director Torgleson, do not have control over these other departments?",191,,
958,0.97,7575.935,7581.006,I guess--is it--do you feel that there's good coordination going on right now?,191,,
959,0.97,7581.073,7586.612,Do I need to be asked maybe don't answer the question . do I need to be asking more questions.,191,,
960,0.97,7586.679,7591.65,Maybe I'll just be highlighting that I need to be asking more questions.,191,,
961,0.97,7591.717,7591.917,There we.,191,,
962,0.97,7591.984,7597.356,"But if There's anything that you can speak to the I.D.T., that would be helpful.",191,,
963,0.97,7597.423,7602.494,I would just add partner with these other departments and are committed to working together.,192,,
964,0.97,7602.561,7612.972,"But I will say that there isn't one single authority outside of the Executive's office, that really has the authority to make significant change in those departments.",192,,
965,0.97,7613.038,7614.606,So we try to influence the process.,192,,
966,0.97,7614.673,7616.608,And there's only so much we can do.,192,,
967,0.97,7616.675,7618.344,But we do partner quite well together.,192,,
968,0.97,7618.41,7622.815,And as more and more departments are coming on board the enterprise platform.,192,,
969,0.97,7622.881,7626.085,The more we're meeting in terms of I.T.,192,,
970,0.97,7626.151,7626.485,Context.,192,,
971,0.97,7626.552,7630.656,But we don't so much have a business enterprise structure in place quite yet.,192,,
972,0.97,7630.723,7635.461,That was one of the things listed as we're working on this.,192,,
973,0.97,7635.527,7638.597,It would be great to have support.,192,,
974,0.97,7638.664,7639.231,Thank you.,193,,
975,0.97,7639.298,7648.674,The recent where the six permanent housing--supportive housing projects that were funded back in August.,194,,
976,0.97,7648.741,7655.18,We meet on a monthly basis . that's obviously very staff intensive.,194,,
977,0.97,7655.247,7662.921,But that's been super successful model working together in Realtime with the applicants to resolve permitting challenges.,194,,
978,0.97,7662.988,7663.288,Great.,195,,
979,0.97,7663.355,7663.589,Thank you.,195,,
980,0.97,7663.655,7667.993,"And could you--you mentioned a couple of times, could you slide to slide 17?",195,,
981,0.97,7668.06,7683.442,"Both of have you mentioned a number of times throughout the presentation, what happened in the last recession, where we had layoffs across the city . and the impact that that had on your permit review time.",195,,
982,0.97,7683.509,7696.455,"I just, I guess I'm taking this opportunity to thank vice chair MOS Questionedda with--Mosqueda.",195,,
983,0.97,7696.522,7705.931,"What we were able to do in the face of laying off city staff, we were able to retain everyone's jobs.",195,,
984,0.97,7705.998,7724.083,"And that has immediate impact because if you were, again, asked to reduce your staffing, we would see higher amounts of time for these permits to be reviewed I guess that wasn't a question.",195,,
985,0.97,7724.149,7724.95,That was a statement.,195,,
986,0.97,7725.017,7726.618,And you're still a low.,196,,
987,0.97,7726.685,7726.885,Sorry.,197,,
988,0.97,7726.952,7732.091,I don't know what is going on . It's usually not that bad . Let me know if you're not able to hear me.,197,,
989,0.97,7732.157,7737.463,If you look at this graph . where it says staffing shortage.,197,,
990,0.97,7737.529,7741.567,"And Nathan, if you slide back to slide 16.",197,,
991,0.97,7741.633,7748.907,You can see here the value dropoff was significantly more than volume dropoff.,197,,
992,0.97,7748.974,7757.516,"The value or the revenue, which is associated with the revenue we take in, dropped off by 62% . But the volume only dropped off by 30%.",197,,
993,0.97,7757.583,7766.725,So the number of permits that came in was only a 30% drop . But the staffing reduction that we had to take was nearly 50% . because of that hit.,197,,
994,0.97,7766.792,7769.962,And we didn't have--we had a core staffing Reserve.,197,,
995,0.97,7770.028,7774.233,But not a very substantial one . So we weren't able to ride it very very long.,197,,
996,0.97,7774.299,7791.783,"And that's really what led to the volumes remain but the staffing level really significantly dropped off . and that's what led to that spike over the course of time . and then in 2011, 12, when the economy really started roaring back, especially with the apartment complex.",197,,
997,0.97,7791.85,7793.752,That's when we started hiring back up again.,197,,
998,0.97,7793.819,7797.789,We were able to recall some of the staff that had been laid off.,197,,
999,0.97,7797.856,7798.29,And really Ramped up.,197,,
1000,0.97,7798.357,7801.093,"But at that point, we were chasing the economy up the hill.",197,,
1001,0.97,7801.16,7804.196,And we really wanted to avoid that happening again.,197,,
1002,0.97,7804.263,7807.866,"So in that 2014, 15, 16 kind of time frame.",197,,
1003,0.97,7807.933,7814.573,We revamped our free structure and really created a robust core staffing model.,197,,
1004,0.97,7814.64,7818.577,So we could hang on to staff dips.,197,,
1005,0.97,7818.644,7822.114,"Basically, last in, first out in the Union structure.",197,,
1006,0.97,7822.181,7828.02,We didn't want to have to cut the brand new staff that we were hiring over this last 10- year period.,197,,
1007,0.97,7828.086,7828.754,And start losing them.,197,,
1008,0.97,7828.82,7830.522,The other industry or private sector.,197,,
1009,0.97,7830.589,7833.458,But be able to have them on board.,197,,
1010,0.97,7833.525,7834.326,For just this moment.,197,,
1011,0.97,7834.393,7835.06,Where we're coming back.,197,,
1012,0.97,7835.127,7839.898,"We see the economy, just Cueing up as Covid is sort of slowly Ramping down.",197,,
1013,0.97,7839.965,7856.181,And we see and predict that the economy will be Ramping up . We have those staff in place . and we're working even more on those temporary staffing shortages we saw last fall . I think We've done a lot in the last economic cycle to try to get ahead of this.,197,,
1014,0.97,7856.248,7859.017,That's helpful.,198,,
1015,0.97,7859.084,7860.152,Vice chair Mosqueda?,198,,
1016,0.97,7860.219,7863.822,"Thank you very much, chair.",199,,
1017,0.97,7863.889,7866.425,"Again, appreciate the line of questioning.",199,,
1018,0.97,7866.491,7873.899,"And your leadership on sort of continuing to push the conversation around what is needed in terms of broad changes, Mr. chair.",199,,
1019,0.97,7873.966,7876.401,And appreciate the initial responses today.,199,,
1020,0.97,7876.468,7888.647,"I think that it is absolutely important to have that Cross- agency, interdepartmental coordination as a good goal . and we ought to be doing that as we try to provide good services.",199,,
1021,0.97,7888.714,7890.115,"I think director Torgleson, you mentioned that.",199,,
1022,0.97,7890.182,7895.787,"But a lot of Thursday things, I think we can make improvements on within Sdci.",199,,
1023,0.97,7895.854,7899.091,And I see the good director nodding.,199,,
1024,0.97,7899.157,7905.464,And one of those things that I think we would benefit from is having the data on where we're seeing the most lag.,199,,
1025,0.97,7905.53,7923.649,"Among the areas that we see where there is a Higher-Than- normal delay, it would be very helpful to see what we can do specific in those areas, where we see the slowest reviews of processes.",199,,
1026,0.97,7923.715,7926.184,I assume some have to be beefed up.,199,,
1027,0.97,7926.251,7938.597,"What can we do in those areas . and think it's important to also note, one of the biggest areas I continue to hear feedback on is the design review process.",199,,
1028,0.97,7938.664,7946.438,"And the delay that is experienced when you have to first pass your design review, before you can get your master use permit.",199,,
1029,0.97,7946.505,7954.479,"So looking forward to hearing if there is any other ideas that you might have, very supportive of wanting to staff up in areas where we see the lag.",199,,
1030,0.97,7954.546,7966.325,But is there any bold changes or suggestions that you can think of to make that specifically go faster?,199,,
1031,0.97,7966.391,7971.93,"The design review process, through bold changes, instead of some of the minor adjustments that we all maybe want to do.",199,,
1032,0.97,7971.997,7972.397,And should do.,199,,
1033,0.97,7972.464,7977.903,But are there other bigger things that we should have on our radar?,199,,
1034,0.97,7977.969,7983.709,Councilmember that's an area where we need to do further exploration and more work.,200,,
1035,0.97,7983.775,8002.327,"I know there was a time period earlier, in Covid, where we weren't having any design review board meetings because they couldn't happen virtually . Thanks again, for the Council that passed legislation so we could start up design review virtually.",200,,
1036,0.97,8002.394,8013.171,"That created quite a bit of backlog, when we weren't able to have design review meetings . We have corrected, Court- corrected on that right now, so we're able to schedule those meetings much quicker.",200,,
1037,0.97,8013.238,8018.877,But I think your question is really getting to the overall process.,200,,
1038,0.97,8018.944,8021.179,And we need to do some more work on that.,200,,
1039,0.97,8021.246,8023.915,So we will get back to you on that.,200,,
1040,0.97,8023.982,8036.828,"One of the issues, and I've talked to Councilmember Straus about this is when we do get out of the pandemic, are we going to resume In-Person design review meetings?",200,,
1041,0.97,8036.895,8039.498,Or are we going to stay virtual?,200,,
1042,0.97,8039.564,8043.668,Or are we going to do some kind of a Hidrid Brid?,200,,
1043,0.97,8043.735,8044.503,And--hybrid.,200,,
1044,0.97,8044.569,8047.873,And there are huge technology costs when we do hybrid.,200,,
1045,0.97,8047.939,8057.716,"But there are definitely pros and Cons, we look forward to having that discussion with the executive and with the council as well.",200,,
1046,0.97,8057.783,8062.521,"Thank you, vice thank you, director.",201,,
1047,0.97,8062.587,8067.859,And for everyone's awareness . We are endeavoring to wrap this committee up in the next 15 minutes.,201,,
1048,0.97,8067.926,8069.661,I do have a question.,201,,
1049,0.97,8069.728,8092.851,"Slide 10, I believe it is . circle back on high--Yeah . So one concern that I've heard is that in the past, reviewer might have been able to pick up the phone and call an applicant to clear up an error, whereas now review a staff.",201,,
1050,0.97,8092.918,8098.957,"The reviewer is more likely to issue a correction, rather than just pick up the phone.",201,,
1051,0.97,8099.024,8114.473,Would blue beam allow for more Stream-Lined version of that picking up the phone approach . How is this similar and/or different than the applicant center that you talked about with the able to chat live in Realtime.,201,,
1052,0.97,8114.539,8119.644,Can you share how this will decrease the number of corrections that will be issued?,201,,
1053,0.97,8119.711,8119.911,Sure.,202,,
1054,0.97,8119.978,8121.947,I can talk about that.,202,,
1055,0.97,8122.013,8125.083,Back when we rolled out electronic plan review initially.,202,,
1056,0.97,8125.15,8142.267,"I mean, before we took in paper plan sets, anywhere from 3 to 9 sets of plans, depending on the complexity of the project . and we would physically route each of those planned SETS to each of those we reviewed earlier.",202,,
1057,0.97,8142.334,8148.907,And when we converted in 2013 to electronic plan review . We started using a different tool called Braffa.,202,,
1058,0.97,8148.974,8155.18,And then eventually moved in to like using Adobe pro.,202,,
1059,0.97,8155.247,8163.722,"By 2016, get Incentivized intake for electronic plans, shorter intake appointment times to get people in the door faster if they estimated electronically.",202,,
1060,0.97,8163.788,8166.658,And we had like 95% compliance by 2016.,202,,
1061,0.97,8166.725,8175.033,"And just pulled the trigger out of a pilot program, never really intending to have pull the the trigger.",202,,
1062,0.97,8175.1,8180.438,But we pulled trigger and went fully electronic.,202,,
1063,0.97,8180.505,8181.84,Utilizing those older Technologies.,202,,
1064,0.97,8181.907,8199.324,"And Unfortunately, what happened because of these review locations, reviews, the reviewers lost the ability to just pen to paper, write their corrections on the permit set that they were reviewing and stamp off on their approval . with a phone call, you know to the design professional.",202,,
1065,0.97,8199.391,8207.832,"So what happened was, since that point in time, and through our excel moment up until now . We have been utilizing blue beam as a viewer now.",202,,
1066,0.97,8207.899,8213.572,"But some people are still using Adobe pro, depending on the review location.",202,,
1067,0.97,8213.638,8223.915,"But what has happened is because each of those doesn't have the ability to Red line those plans with their corrections, we have to check the plans back out to the applicants to have them make the correction.",202,,
1068,0.97,8223.982,8241.032,"What this project will do it will allow us to get back to basically having an ability for every review location to have a layer within that plan, that they could Red-Line their corrections onto that layer, within the plan set.",202,,
1069,0.97,8241.099,8247.539,And stamp off their layers . So we don't have to rely on checking it back out to checking the correction and checking it back in.,202,,
1070,0.97,8247.606,8253.111,"It will also allow us to, while the plans are subjected to the correction cycle.",202,,
1071,0.97,8253.178,8254.913,Hop Online with them.,202,,
1072,0.97,8254.98,8268.293,"Just like any Google Doc or one- drive Doc that you can share . and share changes in time . The applicant can ask, am Iaddressing this correction correctly?",202,,
1073,0.97,8268.36,8268.827,Will this solution work?,202,,
1074,0.97,8268.893,8271.363,Or will this be better?,202,,
1075,0.97,8271.429,8288.947,"Have those before Resubmittal, to try to get to points where we're actually getting Compliant, without having to go through further Iteration . So this new technology, integrated with our Acella platform, will allow us to move forward.",202,,
1076,0.97,8289.014,8294.719,"In a way, move backward, Capabilitywise, but move forward with technology to be able to do it better in the future.",202,,
1077,0.97,8294.786,8299.858,"And, avoid some of that Back- And-Forth, that was created because of the conversion to electronic.",202,,
1078,0.97,8299.924,8300.392,Very helpful.,203,,
1079,0.97,8300.458,8301.459,And can you Brere mind?,203,,
1080,0.97,8301.526,8305.664,I know we discussed this before.,203,,
1081,0.97,8305.73,8311.269,But for the viewing public can you remind the difference between reviewing and correction cycle?,203,,
1082,0.97,8311.336,8325.684,"A correction is an within a correction list, from any given review location . and when we route out all of those different review locations, each generates a separate document.",204,,
1083,0.97,8325.75,8339.564,To have the applicant address within the plan set to show or demonstrate code compliance . or substantial code compliance on the document.,204,,
1084,0.97,8339.631,8342.133,"And our reviewers, their Basicemission.",204,,
1085,0.97,8342.2,8345.904,Once we were able to verify that.,204,,
1086,0.97,8345.97,8346.938,They approved their review location.,204,,
1087,0.97,8347.005,8353.211,"And once all of them are approved, that's when we wrap up application and get it out the door.",204,,
1088,0.97,8353.278,8367.525,"So in theory, if an applicant is so perfect there are no corrections to be made, there would only be one Reviewcycle, correct?",205,,
1089,0.97,8367.592,8372.764,In a perfect have no review cycles.,206,,
1090,0.97,8372.831,8379.237,Every applicant would show full compliance and we would be able to issue it on the spot and out the door.,206,,
1091,0.97,8379.304,8379.537,Great.,207,,
1092,0.97,8379.604,8383.908,And you already answered this question.,207,,
1093,0.97,8383.975,8387.812,So I'll summarize the next question.,207,,
1094,0.97,8387.879,8395.787,"Intake issuance, the factors are review desks within Sdci, and the Applicant'S ability to return that correction.",207,,
1095,0.97,8395.854,8407.365,"And also, repeating what I already heard in the presentation today is that when an applicant brings a correction, they do not have to go to the back of the line . They are put right back to the front of the Queue.",207,,
1096,0.97,8407.432,8407.799,Exactly.,208,,
1097,0.97,8407.866,8413.404,"We have a much shorter target time line for correction turnaround, than we do for initial plan review.",208,,
1098,0.97,8413.471,8423.381,"Simply because we want to try to get those out the door . and theoretically, every cycle has less and less corrections . Because you're addressing at least some of the corrections each time.",208,,
1099,0.97,8423.448,8428.453,And you should be getting to a smaller and smaller list through each cycle.,208,,
1100,0.97,8428.52,8434.692,"And then my last, last technical question, then, is back to the general questions.",209,,
1101,0.97,8434.759,8439.397,Slide 21.,209,,
1102,0.97,8439.464,8443.902,The target review.,209,,
1103,0.97,8443.968,8458.683,Is the target review time for simple medium or complex . simple medium four weeks . is that target review time for the first look at the permit application?,209,,
1104,0.97,8458.75,8459.984,Or for a deeper view?,209,,
1105,0.97,8460.051,8460.451,Yes.,210,,
1106,0.97,8460.518,8478.269,"It's the initial plan review . and initially, back in the early 2000S, when we did our revamp, the goal, the Council goal was 80% in two weeks . But that just meant that we missed one out of five, which to me, wasn't a good enough target.",210,,
1107,0.97,8478.336,8498.256,"So what we've over time been shooting for is within a Two- to Four-Week period, we're going to try to get 95% of our initial plan reviews done on our medium complexity units which is about 80 to 85% of our volume, done within that Two- week window.",210,,
1108,0.97,8498.323,8502.961,And for the complex permits that take a longer period of time to review.,210,,
1109,0.97,8503.027,8509.067,"Anywhere between 6, a little, plus, up to 20, 40 hours, depending on if it's a high- rise buildings.",210,,
1110,0.97,8509.133,8529.988,"Those are the ones that Frawl into the more complex category . much smaller volume of permits . But much more COM--complex . Initially, it was 80% in eight weeks.",210,,
1111,0.97,8530.054,8531.155,And we're stretch striving.,210,,
1112,0.97,8531.222,8533.291,Great.,211,,
1113,0.97,8533.358,8536.227,So if my next class I'll be taking from you.,211,,
1114,0.97,8536.294,8538.429,Hopefully it will be permitting class 103.,211,,
1115,0.97,8538.496,8548.706,We've had two classes so far . Some of the things that I'd love to focus in on are what resources you need in order to improve permit turn around times.,211,,
1116,0.97,8548.773,8552.31,How we should be structuring these goals.,211,,
1117,0.97,8552.377,8553.211,For turn around times.,211,,
1118,0.97,8553.278,8561.886,And then my last question . and I'd love to have that meeting and maybe a few more in between now and your next report.,211,,
1119,0.97,8561.953,8575.833,"My last two questions or last real question here is, what steps do we need to take in the next month, next quarter, and next year to improve permit review times?",211,,
1120,0.97,8575.9,8579.938,I'll let Nathan that.,212,,
1121,0.97,8580.004,8580.505,Yeah.,213,,
1122,0.97,8580.571,8587.345,I think one of the things that we're looking at right now is design review.,213,,
1123,0.97,8587.412,8603.061,"And this isn't directly related to the amount of time it takes to get through design review . But just how we are going to continue to do design review board meetings in the future . whether that's virtual, continuous virtual, hybrid, or back in person.",213,,
1124,0.97,8603.127,8614.639,"You know, by the end of the year, we hope to have blue beam throughout the Department, which should significantly reduce the number of corrections cycles.",213,,
1125,0.97,8614.706,8623.781,Hopefully we'll be back to in person application service center.,213,,
1126,0.97,8623.848,8628.987,Which just having that Face-To- face interaction should help with overall permitting.,213,,
1127,0.97,8629.053,8637.462,"And hopefully we talked about contingent budget authority, where we're able to hire a people on a temporary, usually, a two-year basis.",213,,
1128,0.97,8637.528,8643.401,And the people that we have hired will be fully trained by the end of the year.,213,,
1129,0.97,8643.468,8646.838,Including some of the staff in other city departments.,213,,
1130,0.97,8646.904,8657.248,"And you know, some of the things that are longer than a year are just looking at the Vrtual applicant service center.",213,,
1131,0.97,8657.315,8667.191,"And then how we can provide services out in the neighborhoods, whether that's at our customer service bureaus or at our public libraries.",213,,
1132,0.97,8667.258,8677.402,"And just to add in the next quarter, we are going to see a continued, below the line here, partly due to that continued staffing shortage.",214,,
1133,0.97,8677.468,8680.071,And we're in the midst of hiring right now.,214,,
1134,0.97,8680.138,8681.539,And interviewing actively as we speak.,214,,
1135,0.97,8681.606,8689.38,"But also, that we just took in a huge slew of projects to the Bestof current code.",214,,
1136,0.97,8689.447,8705.997,"And we actually took in probably double the volume . law has said, we don't want to be in the way of people actually being able to best to the code they want to best to . So an Atlanta has a right to apply when they want to apply, in terms of vesting.",214,,
1137,0.97,8706.064,8706.464,Right?,214,,
1138,0.97,8706.531,8722.713,"So normally, we have a consistent number of Intakeappointments to try to keep the flow fairly smooth . But we just created a pig in the python kind of bubble, by taking in a number of projects in the last month, to help people best a code.",214,,
1139,0.97,8722.78,8726.617,So this number will not look good in the next quarter because of that.,214,,
1140,0.97,8726.684,8731.789,There's just a slammed number of projects that came in . and our capacity didn't increase likewise.,214,,
1141,0.97,8731.856,8735.293,It will get better because of staffing changes that we're working on.,214,,
1142,0.97,8735.359,8737.261,And we won't continue that level of volume.,214,,
1143,0.97,8737.328,8746.838,"But just a heads up that that won't look good, probably in this next three-month today period.",214,,
1144,0.97,8746.904,8768.192,Thank you for because we know as policy makers for a policy to be implemented it takes four years from effective date to see that policy fully implemented . What is important about in work and why I've requested quarterly updates is because we know the work that we do today is only going to be implemented and effective six months or nine months from today.,215,,
1145,0.97,8768.259,8774.966,"And so for us to stay on top of this, we have to have just a constant eye on it.",215,,
1146,0.97,8775.032,8785.042,"So I really appreciate both of your--Andy, I appreciate your tutoring of me in this area . and director Torgleson, for all of your work here today.",215,,
1147,0.97,8785.109,8791.048,"Colleagues, do we have any other questions at this time?",215,,
1148,0.97,8791.115,8794.752,Nope.,216,,
1149,0.97,8794.819,8801.726,"Seeing no I just again, want to thank director Torgleson and Andy for joining us today.",217,,
1150,0.97,8801.792,8805.463,We look forward to continuing this conversation.,217,,
1151,0.97,8805.53,8809.167,I'd like to take this moment to thank Councilmember Juarez . [Laughter],217,,
1152,0.97,8809.233,8810.868,Thank you so much.,218,,
1153,0.97,8810.935,8812.37,Thank you so much.,218,,

1156,0.97,8830.087,8831.455,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",221,,
1157,0.97,8831.522,8838.896,If there is no good items for the good of the order --,222,,
1158,0.97,8838.963,8839.497,I don't know.,223,,
1159,0.97,8839.564,8842.867,Councilmember Mosqueda may have a question.,223,,
1160,0.97,8842.934,8844.101,I don't know.,223,,
1161,0.97,8844.168,8845.903,Teresa?,223,,
1162,0.97,8845.97,8846.337,You know what?,224,,

1164,0.97,8846.604,8847.805,I'm looking forward to our increase.,224,,
1165,0.97,8847.872,8848.706,When will that be?,224,,
1166,0.97,8848.773,8852.376,That will be April starting at 9:30 A.M.,225,,

1169,0.97,8857.748,8867.758,"And then we will follow up with the permitting questions Offline, until the next time that they report at the committee.",225,,
1170,0.97,8867.825,8872.33,And Council chair.,226,,
1171,0.97,8872.396,8874.398,I do appreciate your indigenous land acknowledgment by the way.,226,,

1174,0.97,8878.836,8881.439,We can't allow it to be a Rote behavior.,227,,
1175,0.97,8881.505,8882.94,We have to sit with it.,227,,
1176,0.97,8883.007,8883.174,Yes.,228,,
1177,0.97,8883.241,8885.243,Thank you.,228,,
