80,0.97,449.315,454.587,"Seattle parks and recreation, we are really fortunate.",11,,
81,0.97,454.587,456.823,We have one of the best systems in the country.,11,,
82,0.97,456.823,462.128,It's one of the largest departments in the city.,11,,
83,0.97,462.128,464.33,I will go over some of the specific details there.,11,,
84,0.97,464.33,470.236,"It also has a rich history, so Doney park where my office is, the city's first park was founded there in 1884.",11,,
85,0.97,470.236,476.943,"We are being surrounded by very tall buildings, so I am glad we still have that anchor there.",11,,
86,0.97,476.943,497.029,"The system was really found about 20 years later when the board of parks commissioners invited the famed Olmstead landscape architecture firm to help design the parks and Rec system of Boulevard, Greenbelt, across the community.",11,,
87,0.97,497.029,499.465,That still serves as the anchor for our parks and Rec system.,11,,
88,0.97,499.465,512.511,"Our mission is straightforward, anchored in that Olmstead origins, it's really about providing safe, welcoming places for people to learn, play, contemplate, but also recognizes the stewardship of this land and the great resources that we have.",11,,
89,0.97,525.825,533.366,"Our vision, I will go into detail as we move forward, but it's about making sure people are healthy, the environment is healthy, and building strong communities through our values of promoting equity, opportunity, access, and Sustainability.",11,,
90,0.97,533.366,546.812,"As we dig into these values a little bit more, it really has anchored the work we are doing, and we really look at, for example, on the healthy people side, look to participate, support a healthy wide vision for the population.",11,,
91,0.97,546.812,551.617,"Excuse me, a citywide healthy population for the city.",11,,
92,0.97,551.617,565.932,"Folks who feel safe and welcome in our public spaces, and have affordable, fresh food, practice healthy habits to prevent disease and enhance mental well-being.",11,,
93,0.97,565.932,571.07,"We can't do all of those things alone, but we support the efforts of the rest of the city.",11,,
94,0.97,571.07,577.243,"In terms of the environment, we have a significant responsibility as stewards of a significant part of the land.",11,,
95,0.97,577.243,579.111,We control 12% of the land in the city.,11,,
96,0.97,579.111,593.926,"We are really focused on Impacting climate change, making sure that our urban forest stays healthy and grows, and really providing environmental responsibility with our educational programs.",11,,
97,0.97,593.926,596.996,"And then even with our own operations, making sure our infrastructure is supporting these efforts.",11,,
98,0.97,610.309,612.645,The third anchor in our vision is the strong communities piece.,11,,
99,0.97,612.645,619.251,"This is one where we really seek to support all of the needs of community members, whether it's supporting the educational outcomes of children through our before and after care programs, Childcare, Daycare.",11,,
100,0.97,619.251,619.752,Things like that.,11,,
101,0.97,619.752,622.555,"But also supporting economic development, and ensuring we provide opportunities for youth employment, etc.",11,,
102,0.97,622.555,628.194,"And then all of the convening's we do through our Off-Leash areas, community centers.",11,,
103,0.97,628.194,638.004,"It's really builds strong, resilient communities to make folks feel like they are part of an interconnected, vibrant city.",11,,
104,0.97,638.004,649.982,"Also key to our work is this idea of equity, and in the last couple of years, we have been engaged with the public.",11,,
105,0.97,649.982,653.219,We are crafting new strategic plans to guide our work over the next 12 years.,11,,
106,0.97,653.219,660.593,A key component of this is a new initiative where we are calling it our Pathway to equity.,11,,
107,0.97,660.593,671.937,"This is really focused on playing our role and supporting the elimination of institutional structural racism, and really making sure that we achieve racial equity in our city, as part of our work.",11,,
108,0.97,671.937,684.116,"The pieces for us really focus on our work, in terms of our policies, procedures, and making sure there is an equity filter for that working with the workforce to train them.",11,,
109,0.97,684.116,694.193,We've done a lot of additional training trying to move towards becoming an Antiracist organization.,11,,
110,0.97,694.193,696.429,"And then Prioritizing equity, and the way we do our investments.",11,,
111,0.97,696.429,713.546,"One of the steps that will come out of this is creating an equity scorecard, where we will map out, look at all of the indicators that impact these issues to begin to make investments in programs, and facilities, based on that scorecard.",11,,
112,0.97,713.546,722.088,"The final piece I will say here that's really critical's Reimagining, Rethinking our engagement strategy to the community, and make sure that we are out, engaging with folks.",11,,
113,0.97,722.088,728.194,"Especially, folks we haven't traditionally reached.",11,,
114,0.97,728.194,730.83,This will anchor all of our work both for 2020 and beyond.,11,,
115,0.97,743.943,748.114,"Another aspect of this in addition to our key values are healthy strong and equity pieces, is this organizational piece.",11,,
116,0.97,748.114,757.957,"We want to make sure we have a world-class workforce that's well-trained, clear about where we are headed, that has a tool to do the work, but is also just focused on collaboration, excellence, and professionalism.",11,,
117,0.97,757.957,768.434,"We are looking to identify best practices in the work that we do, really focusing our systems, our processes, to make sure we are honoring our responsibility to taxpayers.",11,,
118,0.97,768.434,780.479,"And then working to include new technologies, innovation, and best practices.",11,,
119,0.97,780.479,786.252,Part of that is just making sure we are not just start doing things the way we've been doing them just because that's the way we've been doing them.,11,,
120,0.97,786.252,789.155,We have been pushing ourselves to continue to work on becoming an excellent organization.,11,,
121,0.97,789.155,790.222,How do we do that?,11,,
122,0.97,790.222,792.158,I mentioned the robustness of our parks system.,11,,
123,0.97,792.158,797.363,We have 6400 acres of Parkland across the city.,11,,
124,0.97,797.363,804.57,485 individual parks.,11,,
125,0.97,804.57,807.973,"As I said, this represents 12% of the city land, but you can see the long list here.",11,,
126,0.97,807.973,819.985,"There's more, but this includes 120 miles of trails, boulevards, beaches, pools, golf courses.",11,,
127,0.97,819.985,822.555,"207 sports fields, 150 play areas, 14 Off-Leash areas, and much more.",11,,
128,0.97,822.555,834.8,"As we have found out and hear about every day, if we were to leave it up to our communities, it would be many more of these things, so folks really appreciate what we do, and want more of it.",11,,
129,0.97,834.8,836.669,"But Jesus, can I have a moment?",11,,
130,0.97,836.669,845.411,A quick question thinking back to your reference earlier to an equity scorecard.,11,,
131,0.97,845.411,854.32,Have we use that concept to plot out these facilities?,11,,
132,0.97,854.32,855.788,That's the work we are doing.,12,,
133,0.97,855.788,858.591,"Certainly, we know where everything is, and --",12,,
134,0.97,858.591,868.801,"That is known, but have we translated that information?",13,,
135,0.97,868.801,870.803,That's what we are in the middle of doing.,14,,
136,0.97,870.803,886.452,"Lcpd and the office of civil rights has done a lot of work on the indicators that lead to displacement for communities, so we are leering that on top of this, so when we do go back, when there is a choice about a resource, I want to have the data that says, this community has greater needs because of these indicators, and we will go there.",14,,
137,0.97,898.964,907.339,"It's an important conversation to have with our communities because I think the concept of equity is people are open to that, but at the same time, folks want things in their communities, so we are going to have to be --",14,,
138,0.97,907.339,910.542,Committing to equity means letting go of everything being equal.,15,,
139,0.97,910.542,915.08,Yes.,16,,
140,0.97,915.08,917.95,"We are going to have to be very steadfast, and stubborn about that Conversaton.",16,,
141,0.97,917.95,921.587,We will need and appreciate support from the Council to do that.,16,,
142,0.97,921.587,931.83,Piggybacking off of what Councilmember Herbold mentioned.,17,,
143,0.97,931.83,932.498,We have Magnuson park.,17,,
144,0.97,932.498,932.998,Things are dynamic.,17,,
145,0.97,932.998,943.309,"There are hundreds more Low- income children who live there now, and they don't necessarily have access or scholarships to enable them to participate on the field floor in the programs there.",17,,
146,0.97,943.309,950.015,The Magnuson park community center needs to be Rehabilitated.,17,,
147,0.97,950.015,953.018,There are nearly 1000 Low- income residents that we've encouraged to live there.,17,,
148,0.97,953.018,960.192,We've enabled them to live there.,17,,
149,0.97,960.192,961.46,Now we want to provide those services.,17,,
150,0.97,961.46,964.463,I am happy to hear you talking about the equity scorecard concept.,17,,
151,0.97,964.463,974.44,"Magnuson absolutely is a great microcosm of so many things happening in the parks and Rec system, both with the work we do as well as all of the residents there.",18,,
152,0.97,974.44,985.351,"The community center is in the process of being Rehabbed and expanded to add additional programming space, and we are focused on making sure there is enough either free programming or scholarship opportunities for the folks there.",18,,
153,0.97,985.351,988.153,"There is more work to be done, absolutely.",18,,
154,0.97,988.153,994.46,"To clarify on Magnuson Park, it's about 20% of the building being Rehabbed.",19,,
155,0.97,994.46,1000.165,"Just the Entryway and seismic stuff, but we look forward to doing more in the future.",19,,
156,0.97,1000.165,1003.435,"First of all, thank you for this chart.",20,,
157,0.97,1003.435,1005.471,I don't know if you gave us this before.,20,,
158,0.97,1005.471,1011.777,I am big on lists.,20,,
159,0.97,1011.777,1012.177,Thank you.,20,,
160,0.97,1012.177,1014.179,"I will ask, at some point, that we expand that.",20,,
161,0.97,1014.179,1015.748,We still have this issue.,20,,
162,0.97,1015.748,1021.286,I think Councilmember Herbold can appreciate this.,20,,
163,0.97,1021.286,1023.756,A 123 Restroom buildings that we need more Restrooms in this city.,20,,
164,0.97,1023.756,1032.097,"That is something we are still probably going to take another run at for the budget citywide, for more Restrooms care not just and parks.",20,,
165,0.97,1032.097,1035.067,I imagine it would be parks or Spu that would maintain them.,20,,
166,0.97,1035.067,1039.238,That is something we will talk about.,20,,
167,0.97,1039.238,1040.606,Just putting that out here now.,20,,
168,0.97,1040.606,1042.207,"With the Stadium, were you talking about Memorial Stadium?",20,,
169,0.97,1042.207,1043.275,West Seattle Stadium.,21,,
170,0.97,1043.275,1045.811,What's it called?,22,,
171,0.97,1045.811,1050.716,Okay.,22,,
172,0.97,1050.716,1053.819,I was chair of parks for four years and did not know that.,22,,
173,0.97,1053.819,1054.119,Thank you.,22,,
174,0.97,1054.119,1058.69,Councilmember Mosqueda . But good to see you again.,22,,
175,0.97,1058.69,1066.398,I do have a few questions about a few priorities we worked on over the last two years.,22,,
176,0.97,1066.398,1069.835,Let me know if you have this integrated or if you would rather address it now.,22,,
177,0.97,1069.835,1078.944,"When it comes to the number of the Kiddie pools we had expanded, I believe we had invested in additional hours, so can you comment on that?",22,,
178,0.97,1078.944,1120.853,"And then Additionally, it may have been the year before last, I believe that we included a Vizo language in the budget to request that the fields be open for longer periods of time in the evening, so there were lit fields, so there could be unstructured play, especially as we think about our immigrant and refugee population, or families in the city who don't have the money to play on structured Soccer teams, like I used to be on two years ago.",22,,
179,0.97,1120.853,1126.191,"When we see more people enjoying our great new turf fields in the light, that means people are engaged in really positive physical activity.",22,,
180,0.97,1126.191,1129.995,I think it also adds an element to helping communities for the lights to be on.,22,,
181,0.97,1129.995,1134.6,Can you talk about whether or not we were able to implement that?,22,,
182,0.97,1134.6,1139.104,Structure.,22,,
183,0.97,1139.104,1144.61,"On the pool issue, we did implement the extension of hours, days of operation for certain sites.",22,,
184,0.97,1144.61,1149.481,"I don't have the list in front of me, but we can get that to you.",22,,
185,0.97,1149.481,1164.163,"I think that is part of our longer plan, as well, as we try to figure out what's the best, most equitable distribution of those hours, and then actually, we are thinking about how we can line up with some of our Sustainability work.",22,,
186,0.97,1164.163,1172.437,"For example, Ideally, we would take those Wading pools and convert them to spray parks.",22,,
187,0.97,1172.437,1173.238,Kids love spray parks.,22,,
188,0.97,1173.238,1174.439,They are better for the environment.,22,,
189,0.97,1174.439,1175.44,"They are healthier, safer.",22,,
190,0.97,1175.44,1184.816,"That's part of our work but it will be anchored in where the use is and the need is, but we will make changes and continue to look at that.",22,,
191,0.97,1184.816,1197.262,"Obviously, none of those are open in this weather, so is there timing to be done with that analysis prior to the spring and summer when they open?",23,,
192,0.97,1197.262,1201.099,"We have a schedule for opening already that is based on our normal operations, so that is continuing.",24,,
193,0.97,1201.099,1211.877,"In terms of converting to other spray parks, that's longer term.",24,,
194,0.97,1211.877,1215.48,"So you are moving forward with implementing longer hours, but the conversation about conversion is for the future.",25,,
195,0.97,1215.48,1215.881,Correct.,26,,
196,0.97,1215.881,1219.985,"In terms of fields, I think you hit on an incredibly important aspect of the management of these fields.",27,,
197,0.97,1219.985,1226.491,"I am not aware of a proviso on that, but it's part of what we've been working out.",27,,
198,0.97,1226.491,1227.292,We did a pilot.,27,,
199,0.97,1227.292,1245.377,"Maybe, it was driven in some ways by the proviso, but we did a pilot to do just that, carve out unstructured time at some fields because, often we find when we invest in these fields, the local community members have to deal with the impacts of the additional use, but not necessarily get the benefit of that.",27,,
200,0.97,1245.377,1246.378,One thing we are doing.,27,,
201,0.97,1246.378,1269.534,"This is also in Councilmember Mosqueda's district, but part of the redevelopment of South Park Playfield, we have agreed to keep that field off of our permitting system for five years, so we can allow that community to build their own programming.",27,,
202,0.97,1269.534,1270.335,We are working on that.,27,,
203,0.97,1270.335,1271.536,I think it's a critical piece.,27,,
204,0.97,1271.536,1273.205,I think every field should have unstructured time.,27,,
205,0.97,1273.205,1287.152,"We are trying to find the right balance because although the folks use the fields continue to grow their programming, we have a very finite number of hours for field space.",27,,
206,0.97,1287.152,1289.788,Part of that also is with the partnership of the school district.,27,,
207,0.97,1289.788,1302.434,"They've added additional lighting to some of their field, and those will sort of fit under the joint agreement with the district, which will provide more hours, but I couldn't agree more in terms of the efforts to do more of that.",27,,
208,0.97,1302.434,1308.94,I don't mean to rush you.,28,,
209,0.97,1308.94,1310.308,But we have four or presentations.,28,,
210,0.97,1310.308,1311.343,I have 30 more slides.,29,,
211,0.97,1311.343,1311.777,I know.,30,,
212,0.97,1311.777,1313.645,I am happy to follow up on that.,31,,
213,0.97,1313.645,1325.59,"In terms of how we do this work, we can do it alone.",31,,
214,0.97,1325.59,1332.064,"We have one of the best parks and Rec systems in the country because we've enjoyed a tremendous amount of support from the community, the voters, elected officials, and our partners.",31,,
215,0.97,1332.064,1336.968,"We have dozens of partners, and this is just one, short highlighted list.",31,,
216,0.97,1336.968,1345.911,"I will, the associated recreational Council is our nonprofit partner but does much of our program in our community centers, and they are really well aligned with our mission.",31,,
217,0.97,1345.911,1362.728,"We also have been doing a great deal of partnership with all of our sister agencies, whether it's preschool classrooms in our community centers, or working with the libraries, and others for programming, so we are just really pleased, and feel fortunate to have this.",31,,
218,0.97,1362.728,1374.94,"I will call out, we have an incredibly robust volunteer Corps of tens of thousands of individuals who work as well interior forces in our community centers, but we can't do the work without them.",31,,
219,0.97,1374.94,1375.741,We appreciate that.,31,,
220,0.97,1375.741,1389.354,"Very quickly, on our programming, we do lots, lots of programming, literally for the entire LifeSpan of our residents, and their abilities.",31,,
221,0.97,1389.354,1393.825,"Frankly, I think we change lives.",31,,
222,0.97,1393.825,1409.274,"One quick narrative here, just last summer we had a situation where we were, out of the blue, called by one of the local corporations to receive a grant to provide additional programming.",31,,
223,0.97,1409.274,1409.875,We didn't apply.,31,,
224,0.97,1409.875,1410.876,We weren't looking for it.,31,,
225,0.97,1410.876,1421.253,It came to us because the person in charge of Doling out this money or helping figure out where this would go was someone who had participated in our programming and remembered the impact it had on her life.,31,,
226,0.97,1421.253,1430.996,"So, just a small example of how we change lives.",31,,
227,0.97,1430.996,1441.373,"In terms of the way we are structured, and this is sort of the drier part of the conversation.",31,,
228,0.97,1441.373,1441.973,We have several divisions.,31,,
229,0.97,1441.973,1444.81,"This work is all divided for the superintendent's office, which is policy and direction.",31,,
230,0.97,1444.81,1452.117,Our Finance has all of the things you can imagine.,31,,
231,0.97,1452.117,1454.619,Our parks and amendment division is our largest with over 300 Ftes.,31,,
232,0.97,1454.619,1459.624,"These are the folks out there day today, maintaining, cleaning our parks, Mowing the lawns and the fields, etc.",31,,
233,0.97,1459.624,1475.54,"Our facilities division includes plumbers, Hvac folks, painters, etc., out there making sure these buildings, and these facilities--we have over 500 individual building structures in the system, which is pretty robust, to say the least.",31,,
234,0.97,1475.54,1478.376,These folks do a phenomenal job keeping these things in the best possible condition.,31,,
235,0.97,1478.376,1481.813,"I talked about our recreation division, which includes programming in our facility centers, as well as Aquatics.",31,,
236,0.97,1481.813,1498.864,"Our partnership division is poised for growth, and the idea here is to leverage outside resources, both from our community, partners from our volunteers, so we are trying to build additional revenue to support the work we do.",31,,
237,0.97,1498.864,1515.28,"Our planning and development division is pretty robust for a capital improvement program, and they are just focused on the budget delivery of a whole lot, I think over 300 active projects right now.",31,,
238,0.97,1515.28,1526.892,"Just generally, we have about 950 full-time staff members, and about 1250 part-time seasonal folks.",31,,
239,0.97,1526.892,1538.436,"I am just wondering, where does the conservation Corps fit?",32,,
240,0.97,1539.137,1540.338,The conservation Corps was moved.,33,,
241,0.97,1540.338,1541.339,It was in planning development.,33,,
242,0.97,1541.339,1545.377,"We moved it to the epic division because it's anchored at Magnuson, so we wanted to give them additional support.",33,,
243,0.97,1545.377,1546.611,"Okay, so that's enterprise.",34,,
244,0.97,1546.611,1547.512,Yes.,35,,
245,0.97,1547.512,1550.682,30+-Year-Old program.,35,,
246,0.97,1550.682,1562.627,"Putting folks at work, getting them into jobs that can lead to careers.",35,,
247,0.97,1562.627,1566.698,I just want to flag my fitness.,35,,
248,0.97,1566.698,1570.735,"As I've mentioned to you before, and exploring.",35,,
249,0.97,1570.735,1585.35,"I recognize some of the challenges, but I believe they can be overcome as it relates to Council funding of the mobile Pitstops programming, which is our mobile Restroom facilities.",35,,
250,0.97,1585.35,1608.139,"And other cities with a mobile Pitstop program, they staff those facilities, and they staff those facilities with a population of workers that is very aligned with the population of folks that we employ through the conservation Corps.",35,,
251,0.97,1608.139,1622.153,"I just want to flag that, that might be an opportunity for continued partnership with other departments whether it's Spu or Hst that's going to be taking the lead on that, we will see.",35,,
252,0.97,1622.153,1622.554,Thank you.,36,,
253,0.97,1622.554,1629.861,We are also very interested in growing the program.,36,,
254,0.97,1629.861,1634.299,"I think part of the Calculus, figuring out how to grow it, is making sure there is work for these folks to do.",36,,
255,0.97,1634.299,1645.644,Welcoming the opportunity to do more of that.,36,,
256,0.97,1645.777,1649.18,Just a Snapshot of who our staff is in terms of gender and ethnic break down.,37,,
257,0.97,1649.18,1650.615,We've got a pretty diverse staff.,37,,
258,0.97,1650.615,1652.817,The majority of our staff identifies as something other than white.,37,,
259,0.97,1652.817,1656.688,We have almost 60% male and 40% female.,37,,
260,0.97,1656.688,1664.195,"Jumping into our budget, as you mentioned at the beginning in your opening, the 2020 adjusted budget is $216 million.",37,,
261,0.97,1664.195,1671.136,"Of that, $175 million is operating, and $87 million is shared capital.",37,,
262,0.97,1671.136,1672.404,This shows you the various sources.,37,,
263,0.97,1672.404,1689.554,"I will highlight that when we talk a lot about our budget, and people talk about the park district, I think while Criticalan important for our work, it represents 20% of our total budget.",37,,
264,0.97,1689.554,1692.223,"When we launched our strategic planning process, it wasn't just about park district.",37,,
265,0.97,1692.223,1699.764,It was about all of our operations.,37,,
266,0.97,1699.764,1701.766,We are happy to answer questions about our work plan.,37,,
267,0.97,1701.766,1723.555,"These are the values planning for our divisions, and very quickly, this is the idea, the reminder that we serve people that we Prioritize equity, and that we are part of a citywide solution to challenges, so the work we do is a key part to support agencies.",37,,
268,0.97,1723.555,1734.899,"And making sure that we recognize our city is growing and changing in many ways, and we want to make sure we are responsive to that.",37,,
269,0.97,1734.899,1736.501,The last couple of things here on the engagement.,37,,
270,0.97,1736.501,1737.535,We work for the residents.,37,,
271,0.97,1737.535,1743.408,"We need to make sure we are always deliberately, and continually engaging with folks to make sure we are providing what their needs are.",37,,
272,0.97,1743.408,1755.386,"And making sure that we honor our responsibility as stewards of the land, mitigating impacts of climate change in a way focused on professionalism, excellence, and best practice.",37,,
273,0.97,1755.386,1759.023,"His is, you can do it or I can do it, but I prefer you do it.",38,,
274,0.97,1759.023,1763.728,I know Councilmember Pedersen will do it Friday.,38,,
275,0.97,1763.728,1765.33,We are going to start the planning.,38,,
276,0.97,1765.33,1766.931,If you want to mention the dates or planning.,38,,
277,0.97,1766.931,1773.238,I will tell you.,38,,
278,0.97,1773.238,1774.906,"In 2014, we approved the Seattle parks district.",38,,

321,0.97,1921.486,1926.19,Go ahead.,57,,
322,0.97,1926.19,1929.494,What we are going to do is walk you through the context for the waterfront program.,58,,
323,0.97,1929.494,1934.565,Our office is a pretty unusual office within the city.,58,,
324,0.97,1934.565,1940.271,"We are only 11 FTE, so probably one of the smallest in the city.",58,,
325,0.97,1940.271,1942.073,We were created with a really specific purpose.,58,,
326,0.97,1942.073,1948.579,Which was to implement the vision for waterfront Seattle.,58,,
327,0.97,1948.579,1955.82,"What you have on the screen is a Footprint of our program area, and I'll talk about some of the details of that.",58,,
328,0.97,1955.82,1968.933,"Really, we started when the decision was made to replace the Alaskan way Viaduct.",58,,
329,0.97,1968.933,1973.004,"You will recall the late discussions we had, a couple of public roads that culminated in the Dee Ford terminal.",58,,
330,0.97,1973.004,1976.607,"Starting at that time, moving forward, we really build a partnership on a couple of different fronts.",58,,

339,0.97,2049.38,2051.983,We all got to watch the Viaduct come down in the last year.,58,,
340,0.97,2051.983,2057.822,"In its place, we are beginning construction of 20 acres of parks, and public infrastructure that really serves, obviously, the downtown community, the whole city, and the whole region.",58,,
341,0.97,2057.822,2060.291,I am going to talk about the different elements in a moment.,58,,

348,0.97,2095.66,2099.931,I am going to guess most of you remember the public process we had around waterfront Seattle.,58,,
349,0.97,2099.931,2109.874,"From about 2010 through 2013, we had a very large, citywide conversation around the future of the waterfront.",58,,
350,0.97,2109.874,2118.516,"Eight series of public events, very large-scale, driven by what could we do with the 20 acres of parks and public space.",58,,
351,0.97,2118.516,2128.893,"How could we create a democratic, inclusive vision for Reconnecting our entire community back to Elliott Bay.",58,,
352,0.97,2128.893,2130.161,That was really the foundation of it.,58,,
353,0.97,2130.161,2131.796,"We had a series of large-scale, public events.",58,,
354,0.97,2131.796,2163.694,"We had community conversations in literally every corner of Seattle, really focused on how can Seattle have that great downtown park that will support every neighborhood in the city, and create a place for programming, community events, celebrations of our city, in a way and in a space that we haven't had in the past because of the presence of the Viaduct.",58,,
355,0.97,2163.694,2173.638,"If you go back, looking at the city's history, there has been talk, and clamoring for reclaiming that waterfront since shortly after the Viaduct was built.",58,,
356,0.97,2173.638,2187.652,"So in a lot of ways, the waterfront Seattle program was an opportunity for the community to come together, and really be able to kind of see that vision realized.",58,,
357,0.97,2187.652,2197.161,"I won't go through the details of the level of engagement, but we have literally hundreds of events, and tens of thousands of people participating in person and Online in the development of that vision.",58,,
358,0.97,2197.161,2209.173,"Early on in the process, city Council and the Mayor, there was a whole series of legislative actions that have guided this from early days.",58,,
359,0.97,2209.173,2216.08,"Probably, one of the most important ones that took place was the creation of and principles for Seattle waterfront.",58,,
360,0.97,2216.08,2220.985,I won't go through all of them.,58,,

364,0.97,2240.071,2258.089,"And the enhancements that before waterfront Park, in terms of Stormwater management, and removing some of our Stormwater overflow events that happened on the Baycol Reconnecting the whole city to the waterfront.",58,,
365,0.97,2258.089,2271.535,"We will talk about how that plays out, and really telling the story of the city's history, as well as looking forward in terms of the cultural elements that are included in the design.",58,,
366,0.97,2271.535,2273.137,"Access and mobility, all of these key ideas.",58,,
367,0.97,2273.137,2284.749,Something that has been especially important as we have watched this play out is the importance of having a bold vision that can adapt over time.,58,,
368,0.97,2284.749,2287.518,We had to deal with the situation when Bertha was stuck.,58,,
369,0.97,2287.518,2298.562,"We had to endure that, and work through that creatively with the state.",58,,

372,0.97,2305.469,2314.578,"I think we are now in our fourth or sixth mayoral administration, so we've had a lot of longevity over time.",58,,
373,0.97,2314.578,2320.117,"Here, you can see the detail of what we are now starting to build.",58,,
374,0.97,2320.117,2331.662,"This is the capital program that was established shortly after the public planning process that I described in 2012, and 2013.",58,,
375,0.97,2331.662,2338.169,"There was a series of key action that took place at the Council, which formed the waterfront program officially.",58,,
376,0.97,2338.169,2348.546,"Established it in the city's capital improvement plan, and also called for an unprecedented level of Public- private partnership on the funding of that waterfront vision.",58,,
377,0.97,2348.546,2367.398,"That's where we introduced the idea of a major philanthropic partnership with friends of waterfront Seattle, a nonprofit organization that was then created, and is now in the process of raising about $110 million for the program.",58,,
378,0.97,2367.398,2370.634,And also to advance the concept of a local improvement district.,58,,
379,0.97,2370.634,2376.173,That would assess downtown properties for the special benefit associated with park improvements.,58,,
380,0.97,2376.173,2383.848,"As I think you all know, the Council acted last year.",58,,
381,0.97,2383.848,2385.483,We're not going to going to that.,58,,
382,0.97,2385.483,2391.555,"A lot of detail today, but obviously, that's a major issue at Council this year, the steps on the Lyd.",58,,
383,0.97,2391.555,2415.946,"In terms of the elements of the program, the backbone of this entire Viaduct is the Alaskan way, so that's taking place from King Street all the way North up to pine street, and from there, the creation of a new street that doesn't exist Útoday called Elliott way, that connects from Alaskan way toward Belltown, Elliott, Western Avenue.",58,,
384,0.97,2415.946,2420.584,"A long, linear promenade, a park promenade, from King Street all the way North to Pike place market.",58,,

389,0.97,2449.48,2450.748,And a series of East-West connections.,58,,
390,0.97,2450.748,2453.918,I talked about connecting the whole city to this new waterfront.,58,,
391,0.97,2453.918,2485.082,"You will see these fingers that connect and, from Pioneer square, downtown, a major new connection between the Pike and pine corridor all the way down to the waterfront with what we call the overlook walk, which will connect Pike place market to the waterfront market, as well as Pike and pine Street improvement, where parks is reaching at least two Capitol Hill through the Pike pine corridor to improve those streets, and then finishing off with fell Street Park, if you are familiar with that and Belltown.",58,,
392,0.97,2485.082,2491.722,The last two blocks will be finished by our program to connect it down to the waterfront.,58,,

394,0.97,2496.026,2496.827,Thank you very much.,60,,
395,0.97,2496.827,2502.166,I was really happy to work with the chair to support this vision.,60,,
396,0.97,2502.166,2508.973,"In saying that, I know we continue to address questions around equity, access.",60,,
397,0.97,2508.973,2520.551,"This is a park for all of Seattle, but there is a question of how all of Seattle will benefit, so can you talk a little bit about the equity analysis that you have incorporated into this full spectrum of what's going to happen on the waterfront?",60,,
398,0.97,2520.551,2536.8,"And if there is any specific features of the project you have incorporated in response to the equity concerns that have been raised in the last few years, based on their feedback, that would be helpful for us to hear.",60,,
399,0.97,2536.8,2538.602,This has been an important topic for us.,61,,
400,0.97,2538.602,2541.906,We did an analysis with the frenzy waterfront Seattle over the last year and a half.,61,,
401,0.97,2541.906,2564.628,"The focus of that has been how to take this idea of the waterfront for all, inclusive participation in the project, and really identify the strategies we are using that deliver on that concept.",61,,
402,0.97,2564.628,2568.732,I am going to highlight a couple of the key things we are focusing on in partnership with them.,61,,
403,0.97,2568.732,2580.177,"What we heard consistently through public engagement was that we needed to create spaces, Venues in's parks that were comfortable, attractive to every community, so that it did not read, feel like a downtown only space.",61,,
404,0.97,2580.177,2588.018,"Obviously, it's going to serve downtown users, but we would Proactively invest in bringing every neighborhood into the project.",61,,
405,0.97,2588.018,2595.125,"What we have essentially established with frenzy waterfront Seattle is they are our programming, and operating partner.",61,,
406,0.97,2595.125,2607.471,"They are working hand in glove with the parks Department they are directly investing, and helping communities come into use these new parks.",61,,
407,0.97,2607.471,2615.813,"That Scaling up as we bring these spaces Online, so for example, for the last two years, they've been working with us on waterfront Park, to go ahead and start experimenting with how they can do the programming, and activation.",61,,
408,0.97,2615.813,2624.355,"They are providing direct support to a variety of different organizations, to do events in the park.",61,,
409,0.97,2624.355,2635.132,"Some of the examples, things that they are experimenting with, they worked with an organization called 206 in Rainier Valley, to bring youth participation, Hip-Hop music, art into the space.",61,,
410,0.97,2635.132,2641.639,"Falcon with an Organizatio called K-Pop, which is focused on Korean pop if you know that music, which was a total experiment.",61,,
411,0.97,2641.639,2642.506,They funded that.,61,,
412,0.97,2642.506,2654.018,"There's an under the radar organization of people who are engaged in that, and help fund them to do events.",61,,
413,0.97,2654.018,2656.02,They are Scaling that up in a variety of ways.,61,,
414,0.97,2656.02,2661.125,"This spring and summer, they will be taking on Pier 62, bringing events there.",61,,
415,0.97,2661.125,2665.162,"They are working with Africa town, to bring them to Pier 62.",61,,
416,0.97,2665.162,2677.808,"Also, working with the tribal community in helping to support that organization, that event Scaling up in the parks.",61,,
417,0.97,2677.808,2678.809,It's not a baked recipe.,61,,
418,0.97,2678.809,2682.446,"They are in and experimentation, trying to see what works, bringing people in.",61,,
419,0.97,2682.446,2695.259,"The other thing I want to say that we are highlighted highlighting, we see a huge amount of foot traffic.",61,,
420,0.97,2695.259,2695.859,"Obviously, tourism.",61,,
421,0.97,2695.859,2697.728,"A huge, local population uses the waterfront.",61,,
422,0.97,2697.728,2705.836,"As part of our partnership with friends, we are setting up a small business Incubator program.",61,,
423,0.97,2705.836,2706.67,We are working with ventures.,61,,
424,0.97,2706.67,2707.438,You may no.,61,,
425,0.97,2707.438,2726.156,"To really make sure that we are not creating a lot of retail space . We are creating a couple with opportunities to Incubate small businesses from disadvantaged communities in Seattle, so ventures is a partner to friends, to make sure we can do that with those spaces.",61,,
426,0.97,2726.156,2731.195,Those are just a couple of examples.,61,,
427,0.97,2731.195,2734.264,"I think I'm going to move on from the design, talk about construction, and our funding.",61,,
428,0.97,2734.264,2743.607,I want to give a shout out to Jessica Murphy.,61,,
429,0.97,2743.607,2758.255,"She has been very involved in a lot of the major construction for the D.O.T., and Angela Brady, who couldn't be here today, who have stood up a construction management team, which is, I would say, three quarters of our effort easily, the day-to-day delivery.",61,,
430,0.97,2758.255,2760.691,"I am just going to highlight, Jessica can go in more detail.",61,,
431,0.97,2760.691,2762.626,This is what it looks like on Alaskan way.,61,,
432,0.97,2762.626,2766.864,We have essentially taken over the construction where you saw the state taking down the Viaduct.,61,,
433,0.97,2766.864,2771.435,The crews now are waterfront Seattle teams.,61,,
434,0.97,2771.435,2778.942,"We are doing a variety of utility replacements out of the gate, putting in New transmission lines for city light.",61,,

436,0.97,2783.413,2789.319,That's what you see going on right now.,61,,
437,0.97,2789.319,2798.028,"A very important, early piece of our project is to connect Columbia street where we used to have the On-Ramp for the Viaduct.",61,,
438,0.97,2798.028,2801.265,That will soon be opened as a major Pathway to regional transit.,61,,

440,0.97,2805.335,2818.348,"If others do, that bus has been on a temporary route for several months, and very shortly, it will be reestablished on Columbia, which will improve speed and Transportability.",61,,
441,0.97,2818.348,2819.349,Six months or less?,62,,
442,0.97,2819.349,2823.787,Within the month.,63,,

446,0.97,2832.162,2832.763,Believe me.,65,,
447,0.97,2832.763,2834.598,We have a lot of West Seattleites.,65,,
448,0.97,2834.598,2838.068,It wasn't planned.,65,,
449,0.97,2838.068,2842.306,We are as motivated as anyone to get that open.,65,,
450,0.97,2842.306,2846.977,I hope rapid ride riders will appreciate it.,66,,
451,0.97,2846.977,2851.014,It will be a lot more reliable than the current situation.,67,,
452,0.97,2851.014,2857.521,Pier 62 is where we used to have our nights on the pier.,67,,
453,0.97,2857.521,2859.189,This is some of our contractors out there.,67,,
454,0.97,2859.189,2860.29,It's getting close to completion.,67,,
455,0.97,2860.29,2861.725,"That's the railing, the new deck.",67,,
456,0.97,2861.725,2869.933,We are excited to be opening that later in the spring.,67,,
457,0.97,2869.933,2874.238,The frenzy waterfront Seattle will be in partnership with the parks Department operating that new pier as soon as it opens.,67,,
458,0.97,2874.238,2881.511,"I just wanted to emphasize, as we leave construction, how important it is to our team that we have a really Proactive plan to preserve access.",67,,
459,0.97,2881.511,2889.653,This is a diagram that shows you how we manage pedestrian access through the construction zone.,67,,
460,0.97,2889.653,2892.289,"We've got Colmon dock, all of the transit movements.",67,,
461,0.97,2892.289,2900.764,"This is something Jessica Alba team focus on every single day, attentively, keeping those pathways open.",67,,
462,0.97,2900.764,2906.336,"We do have temporary closures where we have to close certain Crosswalks, or shift people.",67,,
463,0.97,2906.336,2917.681,"We work intensively on the Signage, and communicating ahead of time to the traveling public, but also our property owners.",67,,
464,0.97,2917.681,2924.388,We are working hard at keeping the Mainline Alaskan way open for traffic throughout construction.,67,,
465,0.97,2924.388,2930.694,This is an area I used to bike quite a bit.,68,,
466,0.97,2930.694,2932.496,"I mentioned this to the Sdot director, as well.",68,,
467,0.97,2932.496,2940.37,There is no temporary bike Lane that appears to be on the street.,68,,
468,0.97,2940.37,2952.215,"Given the high foot traffic that occurs on our new sidewalk there, which is gorgeous, we do like that it can go in for the marine life that underneath the pier, but there's not a safe place to bike.",68,,
469,0.97,2952.215,2957.688,"I seem a play use trail open during summer, but that's not exactly a bike Lane for commuters.",68,,
470,0.97,2957.688,2977.607,"What I asked of our friend that Sdot is that a temporary bike Lane be added to the street, so that people who are using Biking as a commuting option can stay on the street, and not be trying to weave in and out of tourists, and pedestrians that are walking on the sidelines.",68,,
471,0.97,2977.607,3005.836,"I understand once it's finally completed, you are going to have an incredible bike Lane, but it's pretty scary down there, especially as people lined up to get on 99 cell, and I am wondering if you have heard that concern, if there is still Úthe ability to add not just a shared blame because it gets congested down there, but a narrow bike Lane, so people know where the revenue is.",68,,
472,0.97,3005.836,3007.337,We are aware of that concern.,69,,
473,0.97,3007.337,3012.743,"The core issue is around space, and how to provide a safe space with the rebuild project.",69,,
474,0.97,3012.743,3015.379,"I will just add, you are right.",70,,
475,0.97,3015.379,3019.649,The bicycle facilities have been inadequate for a long time.,70,,
476,0.97,3019.649,3022.452,A Multiuse path has served that purpose for a long time.,70,,
477,0.97,3022.452,3032.796,"We did enjoy it during the Seawall construction . acquired Araud underneath the Viaduct, I think the Cycling community appreciated.",70,,
478,0.97,3032.796,3035.699,"Now, it's four lanes, very busy.",70,,
479,0.97,3035.699,3037.901,We are trying to maintain access to the Multiuse path.,70,,
480,0.97,3037.901,3044.207,"Certainly, that dedicated space is throughout construction, but space is a constraint.",70,,
481,0.97,3044.207,3069.699,"We are trying to put out more reflectors on some of those temporary polls around them just to make sure the visibility is good on that path and make sure we are not encroaching on its width and it's eight feet wide, but we will also look forward to getting that permanent facility and, and we will work with our partners at Sdot.",70,,
482,0.97,3084.981,3088.518,"Another item I've mentioned is the need for more bike Corrals, especially down by the ferry terminal.",71,,
483,0.97,3088.518,3092.556,There have been a number of people I think have been excited to try our rental bikes that are available.,71,,
484,0.97,3092.556,3095.459,"Unfortunately, we lost one, but there is still a jump bike out there.",71,,
485,0.97,3095.459,3099.062,"I would love to see a bike corral because right now, they get parked right on the sidewalk.",71,,
486,0.97,3099.062,3103.333,"They are a danger for those with disabilities or vision Impairments, and a danger for pedestrians, and other cyclists in the area.",71,,
487,0.97,3103.333,3106.57,That could potentially be a pretty quick fix as we get everything else done.,71,,
488,0.97,3106.57,3114.544,"I know this is not the entire presentation, but just because Úit happens to be part of this slide.",71,,
489,0.97,3114.544,3118.381,With asked that question.,72,,
490,0.97,3118.381,3124.888,"They found with Sdot in general, how to get users to use these Corrals.",72,,
491,0.97,3124.888,3133.196,That's part of the thing with the Bikesharing is it's designed for jump.,72,,
492,0.97,3133.196,3134.197,But there's none right now.,73,,
493,0.97,3134.197,3135.599,I was call it the foot Ferry.,73,,
494,0.97,3135.599,3142.372,The water taxi.,73,,
495,0.97,3142.372,3145.809,"It's a beautiful facility down there, but still, people come without a place to put their bikes.",73,,
496,0.97,3145.809,3150.58,That's something I would love to follow up with you guys on now that we have the new water taxi area.,73,,
497,0.97,3150.58,3157.32,I will hold my other comments about a desire for a year-round water taxi.,73,,
498,0.97,3157.32,3160.323,That would be a great way for more people to enjoy the waterfront.,73,,
499,0.97,3160.323,3161.825,"Right now, we have limited hours during the winter.",73,,
500,0.97,3161.825,3170.333,"I think it's a missed opportunity for midday tourists, families, and we can families for them to come back and forth.",73,,
501,0.97,3170.333,3171.735,It's a great service.,74,,
502,0.97,3171.735,3175.038,Sure.,75,,
503,0.97,3175.038,3176.239,Trying to keep to schedule.,76,,
504,0.97,3176.239,3178.508,I know you have a lot to hear from different departments.,76,,
505,0.97,3178.508,3181.611,A quick Snapshot of our schedule.,76,,
506,0.97,3181.611,3186.816,The key thing to know is we are well underway now.,76,,
507,0.97,3186.816,3190.353,We will be hard at work on construction into 2024.,76,,
508,0.97,3190.353,3196.56,We have about four years of total construction.,76,,
509,0.97,3196.56,3203.266,"The roadway will be the first element that will open, the first major element, which will open ahead of that.",76,,
510,0.97,3203.266,3205.435,We are still working through the details of that scheduling.,76,,
511,0.97,3205.435,3207.771,It won't be that everything opens all at once in 2024.,76,,
512,0.97,3207.771,3210.574,"We mentioned, pier 62 will open in the spring.",76,,
513,0.97,3210.574,3215.512,"You also see some of the other related Colmon dock rebuild, mid 23.",76,,
514,0.97,3215.512,3221.151,More to come if they hit that target.,76,,
515,0.97,3221.151,3224.387,It's on the tail end of waterfront construction.,76,,
516,0.97,3224.387,3231.494,"It has been important to get the new surface road open as they begin the work, as well.",76,,
517,0.97,3231.494,3234.965,But this is basically our work plan.,76,,
518,0.97,3234.965,3235.565,Yes.,77,,
519,0.97,3235.565,3238.201,We were looking back at the last four.,78,,
520,0.97,3238.201,3238.602,Good job.,78,,

522,0.97,3244.307,3245.308,$728 million total budget.,79,,
523,0.97,3245.308,3248.178,This is essentially the capital program that you see.,79,,
524,0.97,3248.178,3252.415,You can see the funding partnership I mentioned at the beginning.,79,,
525,0.97,3252.415,3258.321,$260 million of city funds.,79,,
526,0.97,3258.321,3259.723,About $200 million of state funding.,79,,

528,0.97,3270.5,3274.037,"That's part of the funding that also included the deep bored tunnel, and other related projects.",79,,
529,0.97,3274.037,3277.04,"$110 million of private Philanthropy, and the $160 million local improvement district.",79,,
530,0.97,3277.04,3279.643,We should give a big shout out to friends of the waterfront.,80,,
531,0.97,3279.643,3281.745,They've been front and center with us raising the $110 million.,80,,
532,0.97,3281.745,3287.751,It has been phenomenal watching the public private partnership on that.,80,,
533,0.97,3287.751,3288.952,We could come and talk.,81,,
534,0.97,3288.952,3291.021,They could give you an update on their progress.,81,,
535,0.97,3291.021,3293.823,They are doing a great job of broadening their organization right now.,81,,
536,0.97,3293.823,3296.526,"They are really staffing up for programming, community outreach.",81,,

542,0.97,3322.786,3328.992,"We are going to have more public Restrooms, correct?",82,,
543,0.97,3328.992,3329.392,We are.,83,,

551,0.97,3352.782,3354.617,Most importantly is what you can expect going forward.,85,,
552,0.97,3354.617,3365.528,"We had our first of a series of public hearings on Tuesday this week, and the final phase of the L.I.D., which is the confirmation of the final assessment roll.",85,,
553,0.97,3365.528,3383.646,"We are anticipating Council will anticipate action in June of this year on that after we've gone through the hearing Examiner process, and then final action regarding the bond ordinance, to actually issue bonds against the funding source that would take place in the fall of this year.",85,,
554,0.97,3383.646,3392.155,"So really, our major topic with this Committee, we are happy we get to continue working directly with this Committee, will be around the L.I.D.",85,,
555,0.97,3392.155,3392.756,This year.,85,,
556,0.97,3392.756,3396.025,These civic projects.,86,,

561,0.97,3400.93,3406.97,Thank you.,89,,
562,0.97,3406.97,3410.34,"As we know, there's a beautiful, old structure down there next to the water taxi entrance.",89,,
563,0.97,3410.34,3415.345,"I don't know how old it is, but it looks original.",89,,
564,0.97,3415.345,3425.088,"Is part of our rear design going to be incorporating that into some sort of park element, for folks who don't know what I'm talking about, maybe you can explain.",89,,
565,0.97,3425.088,3427.49,It's the Washington Street bill Clinton.,90,,
566,0.97,3427.49,3434.798,That was the original home of the Harbormaster.,90,,
567,0.97,3434.798,3436.065,"Basically, the building fell into disrepair.",90,,
568,0.97,3436.065,3439.302,"We actually just finished the restoration of it, so you probably noticed, it looks great now.",90,,
569,0.97,3439.302,3440.703,Is a landmark building.,90,,

572,0.97,3443.373,3450.48,The building is fenced off right now.,90,,
573,0.97,3450.48,3453.917,"Ultimately, once the park is built around it, it is part of the promenade.",90,,
574,0.97,3453.917,3457.587,It will be a center for help people arrive from Pioneer square.,90,,
575,0.97,3457.587,3462.325,And I mentioned this partnership around small business Incubator food and beverage.,90,,
576,0.97,3462.325,3468.331,"There is a small Harbormaster's office, which is that small space.",90,,
577,0.97,3468.331,3470.2,That will actually be small food and beverage.,90,,
578,0.97,3470.2,3472.836,"Coffee, ice cream, those types of things.",90,,
579,0.97,3472.836,3476.039,We are looking for an opportunity to bring in a partner to work with us there.,90,,
580,0.97,3476.039,3487.851,"The last thing I will say is if you look next to it, we have the habitat bench, that was built by Jessica and her team as part of the Seawall, the waterfront.",90,,
581,0.97,3487.851,3499.429,That's a Nearshore habitat restoration that was part of our partnership to improve salmon habitat right there.,90,,
582,0.97,3499.429,3506.936,"You can't really use it yet because there's not enough space to really start programming, but as soon as the park is built around it, all of the fences come down, we can use it.",90,,
583,0.97,3506.936,3512.442,We handled concession contracts correct?,91,,
584,0.97,3512.442,3513.042,Parks handles that?,91,,
585,0.97,3513.042,3520.35,We're not going to go to the waterfront peace?,91,,
586,0.97,3520.35,3521.384,Do you handle those contracts?,91,,
587,0.97,3521.384,3523.386,Those are handled by friends of Seattle waterfront.,92,,
588,0.97,3523.386,3526.856,"But we will be involved in those, as well?",93,,
589,0.97,3526.856,3531.761,"We are setting up the license agreements for friends, which will save what our expectations are for them, as far as those concessions.",94,,
590,0.97,3531.761,3538.401,"In the same equity lens we have on all of the other small businesses, incubation.",95,,

595,0.97,3559.122,3561.591,Super free.,97,,
596,0.97,3561.591,3566.596,You can't get more free than that.,97,,
597,0.97,3566.596,3572.335,"They are committed to free public event, bringing the community into the way that they staff.",98,,
598,0.97,3572.335,3586.149,"The point I want to make is we put friends of the waterfront and Aquarium, all of those folks through the same racial social justice lens as everything else, so we make sure all of those contracts are representative of the people who live in the city, correct?",99,,
599,0.97,3586.149,3592.255,Real quick question.,100,,
600,0.97,3592.255,3595.725,"The bombs you Referenced, what's the source of funding to pay the debt on the bombs?",100,,
601,0.97,3595.725,3604.033,We are using two kinds of bonds.,101,,
602,0.97,3604.033,3611.14,We have a set that are issued by the city that are paid back with commercial parking taxes.,101,,
603,0.97,3611.14,3616.646,"That's being used for transportation improvements, but we also have the local improvement district.",101,,
604,0.97,3616.646,3624.354,"Property owners can pay overtime, so issue bonds backed by the local improvement district revenues.",101,,

672,0.97,3978.207,3982.044,Where are we at nationally?,124,,
673,0.97,3982.044,3983.446,We are at the top.,125,,

683,0.97,4035.097,4036.098,I have an anecdote.,129,,
684,0.97,4036.098,4037.566,I had a friend on parental leave.,129,,
685,0.97,4037.566,4039.902,She and her husband were on one income for six months.,129,,
686,0.97,4039.902,4040.77,She went to the library.,129,,
687,0.97,4040.77,4042.605,They told her she had a $60 fine.,129,,
688,0.97,4042.605,4043.406,She is middle income.,129,,
689,0.97,4043.406,4045.408,That was a hardship for them.,129,,
690,0.97,4045.408,4054.617,"She was like, if it was a hardship for me, imagine how hard it is for folks who are really struggling Month-To- month.",129,,
691,0.97,4054.617,4066.729,"She said, once they said I could come and my fines would be waived, we came every day with our new Kiddos.",129,,
692,0.97,4066.729,4068.397,It's really brought them back into the library.,129,,
693,0.97,4068.397,4069.598,It's bringing people back.,130,,
694,0.97,4069.598,4070.399,We are excited about that.,130,,
695,0.97,4070.399,4073.502,"It's amazing how many stayed away because of that one thing, we weren't aware.",130,,

697,0.97,4075.304,4077.54,That is so true.,132,,
698,0.97,4077.54,4078.741,We are quite proud to join.,132,,

709,0.97,4127.289,4136.799,We are excited to see how that increase has carried forward.,134,,
710,0.97,4136.799,4141.704,"We are a city Department of the city of Seattle, but we also operate differently from most of the departments who report to Council.",134,,

713,0.97,4174.236,4179.441,Our funding is structured so that we will have a $91.7 million budget for 2020.,134,,
714,0.97,4179.441,4182.044,That is very helpful to the work that we need.,134,,
715,0.97,4182.044,4187.416,You will also NOTE 64% is from general fund.,134,,
716,0.97,4187.416,4193.522,Which will probably show about 32% adjusted for the increase.,134,,
717,0.97,4193.522,4199.628,And then a small decrease in the general fund.,134,,
718,0.97,4199.628,4204.033,It will all come out with about 3 percentage points of each other.,134,,
719,0.97,4204.033,4211.774,"As we shared, the levy passed, and some of the other promises are shown here.",134,,
720,0.97,4211.774,4213.375,No more late fees.,134,,
721,0.97,4213.375,4218.28,That started January 2. we are really Excitedabout that.,134,,
722,0.97,4218.28,4225.387,"We are here in February or March, depending on when we appear again.",134,,
723,0.97,4225.387,4226.989,We've added additional hours at your libraries.,134,,
724,0.97,4226.989,4238.834,"Each one of the libraries in your district should have additional hours on Sundays, opening up 12:00 noon to provide more access to our resources, also recognizing that we serve the city as a warming shelter in the winter.",134,,
725,0.97,4242.404,4249.812,We will be taking on two additional points in June.,134,,
726,0.97,4249.812,4264.393,"Across seven of our locations, we should be able to get through our learning expansion in June 2020.",134,,
727,0.97,4264.393,4274.637,"We also have new community resource programs for At-Risk youth, that will start June to all of 2020, then Finally, we have three seismic Retrofits that we are working on.",134,,
728,0.97,4274.637,4290.419,"And we have been looking at how we might enhance the vision of each of those seismic Retrofits to give the public some additional resources, and expectations, but we are just in the early stages.",134,,
729,0.97,4290.419,4291.92,We have our social worker downtown.,135,,
730,0.97,4291.92,4293.656,And the new community resource program.,136,,
731,0.97,4293.656,4300.763,We will have a new and a Part- time person.,136,,
732,0.97,4300.763,4307.069,"One of the things we're working with is the program we work through, Dsc, does not have the youth components.",136,,
733,0.97,4307.069,4309.672,We are looking for the additional agency to help us with that aspect.,136,,
734,0.97,4309.672,4314.777,You can follow up Online.,137,,
735,0.97,4314.777,4324.687,I was really excited we were able to get that into the amended levy.,138,,
736,0.97,4324.687,4326.388,"Thank you for your support, the chair.",138,,
737,0.97,4326.388,4334.496,"It would be helpful to know more as your roll out, where those services are, equitably distributed across the city, and I'm assuming it's a drop in the bucket in terms of what you really need.",138,,
738,0.97,4334.496,4348.911,"Simultaneous to that conversation around services or youth, is the desire to have more social service providers at the libraries to help people get connected to jobs, housing, etc.",138,,
739,0.97,4348.911,4354.183,We weren't able to get that included.,138,,
740,0.97,4354.183,4358.42,I think it was security assistance for folks working in the libraries.,138,,
741,0.97,4358.42,4372.034,"If you have more information about the need, so we can Proactively work on potentially adding to, or supplementing what was a pass in the levy on those aspects, that would be helpful for later this year.",138,,
742,0.97,4372.034,4375.938,But that would be appreciated.,138,,
743,0.97,4375.938,4378.307,I know a quick couple things related to that.,138,,
744,0.97,4378.307,4392.554,"Certainly, more of a presence to help us identify the challenges in our libraries would be very helpful, and gave assurance to our public, our staff, as well as many of our patrons who use us.",138,,
745,0.97,4392.554,4399.061,"Someone reminds me every day, many of our daily readers, which is we call our homeless population, are looking for safe spaces, as well.",138,,
746,0.97,4399.061,4407.77,They would rather be inside than outside.,138,,
747,0.97,4407.77,4409.438,We are always looking for opportunities for that.,138,,
748,0.97,4409.438,4419.982,"One of the other things we are looking at, I will follow up with you, is one of the Rcw's, which provides provisions for the safety of the operators of buses, and things like that.",138,,
749,0.97,4419.982,4423.652,We are trying to add library staff workers.,138,,
750,0.97,4423.652,4425.087,We can work on that one.,139,,
751,0.97,4425.087,4431.96,"We have it for police, firefighters, and Embolus drivers.",139,,
752,0.97,4431.96,4432.461,Councilmember Herbold?,139,,
753,0.97,4432.461,4440.302,I want to go back to the additional hours metric.,140,,
754,0.97,4440.302,4444.773,"In the library levy, we promised additional hours.",140,,
755,0.97,4444.773,4447.209,I think we have rolled out part of that.,140,,
756,0.97,4447.209,4449.812,That's the earlier opening.,140,,
757,0.97,4449.812,4454.917,"In June, I hate saying it publicly.",141,,
758,0.97,4454.917,4463.425,We just settled on mid-June for the date that we will roll out the additional hours at seven of the locations.,141,,
759,0.97,4463.425,4470.132,Those were the second part of the levy's request.,141,,
760,0.97,4470.132,4471.4,That's for the later hours?,142,,
761,0.97,4471.4,4474.403,"Yes, that would be the later hours.",143,,
762,0.97,4474.403,4476.038,Great.,144,,
763,0.97,4476.038,4481.944,When will there be more public information about which of the seven libraries are going to be receiving later hours?,145,,
764,0.97,4481.944,4488.65,That information we should be able to give to you.,146,,
765,0.97,4488.65,4491.453,"If not, we were talking about when we will start the public communication about this.",146,,
766,0.97,4491.453,4493.655,That will probably come mid March to April.,146,,
767,0.97,4493.655,4495.357,Fantastic.,147,,
768,0.97,4495.357,4502.664,"Mister and Mrs. Eagle, who we spoke with very often, I appreciate the library's responsiveness.",147,,
769,0.97,4502.664,4507.97,Thank you so much.,148,,
770,0.97,4507.97,4520.549,"We hear about them going straight to you, so we appreciate is coming over.",148,,
771,0.97,4520.549,4535.964,"We will follow up to make sure that, if that announcement of the location--there are seven locations that are getting extra hours as part of the levy, and extra hours added to most of the libraries as a result of the extended service.",148,,
772,0.97,4535.964,4544.106,"Just moving quickly to the next slide, just in case we've never put this in front of you.",148,,
773,0.97,4544.106,4545.24,This is our strategic direction.,148,,
774,0.97,4545.24,4546.542,We do it in three-year increments.,148,,
775,0.97,4546.542,4553.015,We will be rolling out the 2020 to 2022 March of this year.,148,,
776,0.97,4553.015,4561.79,"What we do for the individual, what we do for the community, what we try to do with our library system itself to improve upon it.",148,,
777,0.97,4561.79,4586.748,"The circles themselves are where we focus our attention, and just so you know, we are moving from a quantitative to a qualitative aspect, so even though it may say something like access, you can say we Vetted 65,000 new library cards to the system.",148,,
778,0.97,4586.748,4587.549,That's just a number.,148,,
779,0.97,4587.549,4598.961,"What we really try to say is when we put out 65,000 new cards, we mean we are giving a patron access to the collections, and books that they have more opportunities for programming, social services, such as the tax assistance help, so the number means a lot, but it's what they are able to do.",148,,
780,0.97,4598.961,4607.069,We are really trying to Pivot our conversation about Statistics to a qualitative point as opposed to a quantitative point.,148,,
781,0.97,4607.069,4609.471,I think that will show you more of what we are doing.,148,,
782,0.97,4609.471,4611.94,"Did you put up there, your Hotspots?",149,,
783,0.97,4611.94,4616.645,The Hotspots are not in that one.,150,,
784,0.97,4616.645,4618.246,That would have fallen in the purple section.,150,,
785,0.97,4618.246,4623.285,What we do for the individual.,150,,
786,0.97,4623.285,4630.692,"It's not there just because we choose different things each year, so I'm not sure what will show up in the coming year.",150,,
787,0.97,4630.692,4645.007,"Hotspots, we are doing a great job with, but you can also see it in the technology and access section of where that occurs.",150,,

805,0.97,4706.868,4715.544,We did not take a formal position in the sense that we had much say in end.,152,,
806,0.97,4715.544,4722.05,The state library and has asked everyone to respond to that.,152,,
807,0.97,4722.05,4733.862,We are writing a letter in support.,152,,

818,0.97,4776.438,4790.018,"Then Ou have our elected officials, who are Thankfully trying to preserve it, so it's in their court to preserve any sort of support to get, to keep it as an Archival building, so that we can have access to those documents you pointed out.",154,,
819,0.97,4798.56,4800.328,So we will work with your office?,155,,

826,0.97,4819.414,4824.186,Moving on.,158,,
827,0.97,4824.186,4831.226,"As you know, the whole city is involved in this, but certainly, the library has its fair share of equity work at the library.",158,,
828,0.97,4831.226,4837.566,"We Prioritize our work focusing on equity and a commitment to our STI, leading with race.",158,,
829,0.97,4837.566,4865.527,"We have had our community resource specialist drop in at Ballard, in Capitol Hill, and in reference to Councilmember Mosqueda's question, I know one of the areas we are focusing on with youth is the University library because we have a large homeless youth population that Frequents that library.",158,,
830,0.97,4865.527,4868.263,We want to be able to serve them better with community resource specialist.,158,,
831,0.97,4868.263,4885.547,"The other thing we are doing through that service is trying to offer referral services for shelter, mental health, job training, all of the things you might think of.",158,,
832,0.97,4885.547,4888.617,"We loan the Wi-Fi Hotspot to the homeless encampment, so they have access to that.",158,,
833,0.97,4888.617,4897.325,"Each one can serve 15 people at one time, so if we can install four at one time, that's 60 people with access to the Internet in the encampment.",158,,
834,0.97,4897.325,4897.959,Really quickly.,159,,
835,0.97,4897.959,4900.495,Did we ever clear up the licensing thing on the E-Books?,159,,
836,0.97,4908.203,4912.574,[Laughter] it is still a wrestle with the publisher.,160,,
837,0.97,4912.574,4914.576,We will get right on that.,161,,
838,0.97,4914.576,4914.843,Yeah.,162,,
839,0.97,4914.843,4924.586,"So, the last thing I will share on equity work is we are trying to push our library staff out into the community to talk to the public about what they are doing.",162,,
840,0.97,4924.586,4930.659,That's pretty much a similar picture.,162,,
841,0.97,4930.659,4937.098,"We created it in conjunction with the community, where they felt the need for materials but we were unable to find through publishers.",162,,
842,0.97,4937.098,4940.068,This year's book was a counting book.,162,,
843,0.97,4940.068,4942.003,The year before was an alphabet book.,162,,

845,0.97,4947.709,4954.015,You have Denise Juneau.,163,,
846,0.97,4954.015,4958.32,We were able to do that at the new Holly center.,164,,
847,0.97,4958.32,4958.92,Just to honor them.,164,,
848,0.97,4958.92,4966.394,"Each one of them had a signing ceremony as the authors and publishers were there, so it was a fun event.",164,,
849,0.97,4966.394,4971.9,The community brought out lots of food for everyone.,164,,
850,0.97,4971.9,4976.538,One of the final things I wanted to talk with you about is our work toward future readying for the library system.,164,,
851,0.97,4976.538,4982.043,I know it's easy for many libraries to think about what does programming look like?,164,,
852,0.97,4982.043,4984.646,What books are you going to buy?,164,,
853,0.97,4984.646,4986.748,What type of service will you offer?,164,,
854,0.97,4986.748,4996.057,But one of the ways we are treating this is we are really trying to understand what are the Disruptors going to be that are going to impact the library?,164,,
855,0.97,4996.057,5004.766,"We recognize, as you will see, that there are about nine Disruptors to the work that we do that is going to impact our work.",164,,
856,0.97,5004.766,5006.434,"Just as an example, climate change is one.",164,,
857,0.97,5006.434,5008.737,We have seven locations without air conditioning.,164,,
858,0.97,5008.737,5025.587,"As we serve more of the city in their regard to being warming shelters or cooling shelters, we are going to have to face that issue, and the second one is the urbanization, density increase.",164,,
859,0.97,5025.587,5028.023,"I should say, these are not just Disruptors for the city of Seattle.",164,,
860,0.97,5028.023,5038.099,"These are Disruptors across the world, so we have identified these mine as the things we need to think about for our future, to ensure that we are continually relevant to the public, as they wish to engage us.",164,,
861,0.97,5038.099,5046.041,"At some point, we have been doing presentations on this at library conferences, so if you would ever like me to present on that --",164,,
862,0.97,5046.041,5054.149,"Those are our Disruptors, as well.",165,,
863,0.97,5054.149,5054.416,Yes.,166,,
864,0.97,5054.416,5058.42,"They affect every decision you have to make, certainly, we are going to have to think about this, as well.",166,,
865,0.97,5058.42,5060.021,I have a quick question.,167,,
866,0.97,5060.021,5061.022,Then we can wrap up.,167,,
867,0.97,5061.022,5075.837,"We kind of talked about this Online, but if we can come back, are we going to be working on, or looking at how we can provide library services with the Seattle Caulking County jail?",167,,
868,0.97,5075.837,5077.906,"We can talk about that some more, off-line about it.",168,,
869,0.97,5077.906,5086.614,"Right now, that is a service that King county library system is technically serving.",168,,
870,0.97,5086.614,5104.933,"I know a few years ago, there was a concern as to whether they would continue that, and King County has a new library director.",168,,
871,0.97,5104.933,5106.434,I haven't had a chance to ask her.,168,,
872,0.97,5106.434,5108.97,We would like to make that a priority in our work plan.,169,,
873,0.97,5108.97,5114.075,"As a former public defender and judge, people having access to those materials, you can't bring in a Hotspot, but they have the other material.",169,,
874,0.97,5114.075,5115.51,That has always been a sticking point.,169,,
875,0.97,5115.51,5118.346,"I was hoping we could put it in our work plan, as well.",169,,
876,0.97,5118.346,5119.914,We would like to be in those conversations.,169,,
877,0.97,5119.914,5121.583,We will make sure to do that.,170,,
878,0.97,5121.583,5122.784,Anything else from my colleagues?,171,,
879,0.97,5122.784,5123.384,"Thank you, Allison.",171,,
880,0.97,5123.384,5126.688,Thank you so much.,172,,
881,0.97,5126.688,5128.857,Are you leaving the additional books for the other Councilmembers?,172,,
882,0.97,5128.857,5130.725,"No, they don't get to see them.",173,,
883,0.97,5141.836,5146.374,Is there an estimate to look at how we use the Airspace above our libraries?,174,,
884,0.97,5146.374,5159.187,"For some of the Childcare housing that we had given the proximity to light rail, is that a conversation in the works?",174,,
885,0.97,5159.187,5167.295,"I don't want to park anyone close to a bus, including ourselves.",175,,
886,0.97,5167.295,5169.831,It's not a conversation that's happening as a dedicated or directed conversation.,175,,
887,0.97,5169.831,5178.84,"We have been involved in some conversations with some community agencies who are interested in that type of thing, the Georgetown project.",175,,
888,0.97,5178.84,5183.545,"We just bought a property in that area about a year ago, I think.",175,,
889,0.97,5183.545,5188.449,They have approached us about some sort of collaborative work there.,175,,
890,0.97,5188.449,5189.45,It does present some problems.,175,,
891,0.97,5189.45,5206.434,"I think you might recognize we already have a joint or condominium type approach with our Delridge library, so those are always conversations we are open to having, but I will reach out to them and see if we can start a more formal conversation.",175,,
892,0.97,5206.434,5207.068,"Thank you, guys.",176,,

916,0.97,5332.393,5339.3,That's the value we think we add to this.,183,,

918,0.97,5342.804,5352.113,"I like to show these numbers not to brag or boast, but just to remind people about the value that arts and culture has for our community.",183,,
919,0.97,5352.113,5369.831,"When we were talking about 12 million visitors, were over 12,000 events, or almost $2 billion of economic, or business activity, over $600 million in labor income, $75,000 direct jobs.",183,,
920,0.97,5369.831,5375.503,"Over 18,000 indirect jobs.",183,,
921,0.97,5375.503,5393.154,"It allows us to talk about the impact of arts and culture that we have in our community, and the values that this community has brought to the table because you would not create a Seattle center and any metropolitan area.",183,,

939,0.97,5483.01,5485.813,The ending was the closing of Keyarena.,185,,
940,0.97,5485.813,5490.618,"In 2021, we will have a new beginning, which will be the opening of a new arena.",185,,

944,0.97,5517.478,5525.586,"I also didn't bring you a chart because we are doing Reworking now to try to Pivot into this time, try to make sure, as we go into our future, we are restructured in a way that makes sense.",185,,
945,0.97,5525.586,5528.089,I will share that with you when we are done with that.,185,,
946,0.97,5534.028,5546.507,"When I talked about partnership, place, performance, programs, people, a lot of that has to do with the small, the intermediate gatherings.",185,,
947,0.97,5546.507,5551.012,They are defined by the shared experiences that people have.,185,,
948,0.97,5551.012,5577.204,"We have some of our highlight things where we bring in all of the cultural communities, and so forth, where we make sure everyone in Seattle is a place where they can be part of making sure they are welcome.",185,,
