123,0.97,829.495,850.583,That had been discussed extensively last fall and I believe action has been taken at King County at the King County Council to Cue up discussion for us as a city to hold a discussion on the city park.,35,,

137,0.97,969.535,981.58,The board of trustees and another item from the Seattle public library were received a presentation on the circulation trends throughout 2021.,35,,
138,0.97,981.58,994.96,I want to take this opportunity to share a couple of the Keyinsights regarding 2021 public library circulation trends that I found interesting.,35,,
139,0.97,994.96,1010.009,The pandemic hastened the move as I had managed to include Digital programs and the data Bares that out.,35,,
140,0.97,1010.009,1011.777,Includes constraints from many of the publishers.,35,,
141,0.97,1011.777,1018.117,That's something that on a Nongoing basis will require some of our attention.,35,,
142,0.97,1018.117,1030.362,Print books continue to rebound as the hours of the library are recovering particularly in the wake of the Delta and Omicron variant continuing to burn off.,35,,
143,0.97,1030.362,1042.474,And fiscal media continues its downward trend in the past decade but is coming back a little bit as the pandemic has increased.,35,,
144,0.97,1042.474,1051.65,So just a couple of interesting points from the 2021 circulation data.,35,,
145,0.97,1051.65,1059.358,I do want to briefly comment and I know Council member Pederson will be speaking on this in his report.,35,,
146,0.97,1059.358,1094.259,I do want to take this moment to Association myself with the sentiment eloquently relayed by Council member Pedersen in this press release that has been shared with us and I believe with members of the general public regarding the Heraldadministration's decision to not approve the authority to pursue urgent and immediate repairs to several bridges throughout the city.,35,,
147,0.97,1094.259,1125.29,I appreciate Council member Pedersen's leadership working Collaboratively with myself and several others last year and with Sdot on a plan to put forward a bonding proposal with clearly delineated items including some very significant and necessary maintenance measures for the magnolia bridge in particular which is an incredibly important project in district seven.,35,,
148,0.97,1125.29,1137.236,So I do just want to Association myself with the disappointment in that statement that Sdot will not be pursuing Authoritys in those necessary projects.,35,,
149,0.97,1137.236,1170.669,I know that's going to be incredibly Disheartening for a lot of constituents who worked on shaving those proposals particularly relating to the magnolia bridge over the course of last year and I do just want to thank Council member Pedersen and Council member Mosqueda for her leadership in the process and helping her put that Bondable list together I do hope it's something we can Revisit in the future and that the door is not completely closed.,35,,
150,0.97,1170.669,1179.611,So just wanted to express my support for chair Pedersen and his statement.,35,,
151,0.97,1179.611,1217.182,Finally as Council member Herbold indicated I will be joining Council member Herbold in working Washington on Thursday for a press conference to announce some initial legislation regarding work and labor standards for workers typically known as gig committee workers and look forward to making some statements with Council member Herbold at that time and kick off that big body of legislation that has been a lot of work and a long time coming.,35,,
152,0.97,1217.182,1227.125,Looking forward to taking that to the next level and looking forward to Committee this coming Wednesday.,35,,
153,0.97,1227.125,1232.297,I'll see everybody there if not sooner.,35,,

319,0.97,2663.427,2678.942,I realized going through this event that I often come with my best comments after I give my speech.,38,,
320,0.97,2678.942,2686.517,And I realized that Seattle has some gorgeous downtown hotels.,38,,
321,0.97,2686.517,2688.552,And there's seven in the improvement boundaries.,38,,
322,0.97,2688.552,2703.467,"I want to thank them for pushing forward, advancing their ability to actually charge their customer two dollars and now four dollars a night spent in their hotel rooms.",38,,
323,0.97,2703.467,2707.037,These hotels are taking on the responsibility of explaining this charge.,38,,
324,0.97,2707.037,2733.464,I'm really proud of the work that visit Seattle has done to pool this money to better the area.,38,,
325,0.97,2733.464,2739.737,I thank them for doing sufficient a terrific job Ishepherding those funds.,38,,
326,0.97,2739.737,2749.88,Because we would not have become a world travel destination if they had not done their work.,38,,
327,0.97,2749.88,2759.656,"And finally, this event ended with a tremendously moving send off to Tom Norwalk who is moving into retirement.",38,,
328,0.97,2759.656,2760.457,He's leaving visit Seattle's home.,38,,
329,0.97,2760.457,2766.396,I have to say that I didn't know everybody else felt the same way that I felt like him.,38,,
330,0.97,2766.396,2771.802,"Words like grace, and kindness and hard working and smart kept coming up in conversation.",38,,
331,0.97,2771.802,2779.443,To me he's always represented the epitome of welcoming which is what you want from somebody who's in the tourism business.,38,,
332,0.97,2779.443,2791.321,"So I just, it was a great send off and I will miss him but he's left visit Seattle in a very strong and capable hand and ready to go in the future.",38,,
333,0.97,2791.321,2799.53,"All right, last week I also went on a ride along with an officer in the West precinct.",38,,
334,0.97,2799.53,2803.667,And it was my first time on a ride along.,38,,
335,0.97,2803.667,2810.04,It was really interesting to actually see how officers do their work during patrol.,38,,
336,0.97,2810.04,2810.774,The computer interface.,38,,
337,0.97,2810.774,2816.113,And all the information that's coming at them as calls are being dispatched etc.,38,,
338,0.97,2816.113,2816.613,It's very interesting.,38,,
339,0.97,2816.613,2828.091,I encourage everybody to take advantage of that because it helps me understand kind of what it's like to be in their position driving around Seattle.,38,,
340,0.97,2828.091,2833.363,I also met the officers of the first and second roll Callls.,38,,
341,0.97,2833.363,2848.946,"It was, just to have a conversation with what they're seeing on the streets and also wanting to know sort of what is, what, what is the big picture on public safety in Seattle.",38,,
342,0.97,2848.946,2851.515,So any way.,38,,

345,0.97,2875.239,2890.921,And this was enhanced by wanting to position Seattle well to wanting to support the whole industry and all the disciplines that help our committee.,38,,
346,0.97,2890.921,2891.421,That was last week.,38,,

451,0.97,3684.847,3697.393,First of all I want to thank Council member Pedersen for his leadership in this really important area.,43,,
452,0.97,3697.393,3719.916,And just seeing the Respons to the Council budget office made me reflect on the fact that I experienced very similar and public opposition to what was a very modest $29 million housing bond several years ago.,43,,

456,0.97,3744.44,3767.53,Reflecting on what happened after that opposition is that a majority of Council members ended up prevailing and I Reallyencourage Council member Pedersen to continue his efforts given that this is something that the Council has expressed its support for and hopefully continues to do so.,43,,

461,0.97,3806.269,3817.914,A future levy would not be operating until 2025 and we need to Prioritize bridge maintenance work now.,43,,
