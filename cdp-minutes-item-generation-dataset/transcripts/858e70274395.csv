68,0.97,531.197,547.68,We were forced to close as a result of the enforcement . I personally believe it was an attack on all Black-Owned Dispensaries.,10,,
69,0.97,547.68,556.088,"If you look at it, there is not one person or one organization that is here today in the city of Seattle that is Black-Owned.",10,,

106,0.97,844.51,857.022,In 2011 he signed ordinance 123661 which really solidified medical Cannabis in the city.,16,,
107,0.97,857.022,858.691,That should have given us the grandfather clause.,16,,

133,0.97,991.357,1018.917,"We only legalized properly grow marijuana but we should've had police reform that better trained co-ops to focus on shutting down the crack, Meth and heroin but for some reason we have politicians going out of their way to codify unconstitutional treasonous laws that extend evil drug pushers pushing crime against humanity.",22,,
134,0.97,1018.917,1020.219,They are listed as low-level Misdemeanors.,22,,
135,0.97,1020.219,1028.627,I called in because the oversight on the budget dictates what the government will invest in and does and the policies that it supports.,22,,
136,0.97,1028.627,1037.903,We have needed and expected the homeless crisis to be solved and the lack of pace has city not put forth in a diligent honest effort.,22,,
137,0.97,1037.903,1069.935,"I'm asking Council to reconsider I Daresay bad policy of redirecting all of those American rescue plan dollars that were specifically earmarked to alleviate the oppression of the people suffering, a lack of shall we say like congregate shelter and proper interpretation of like living in a personal, private space not overwhelmed by other peoples customs violating space and concerns.",22,,
138,0.97,1069.935,1081.246,Yet we do not have enough money or expertise to rapidly solve the homeless crisis that will not solve the homeless problem so much.,22,,
139,0.97,1081.246,1102.201,It will alleviate the unnecessary suffering of innocent people graciously discriminated against by the policies that this Council created and that the people that they pay within the Nonprofits who are judging skin color and refusing to judge the character of a criminal.,22,,
140,0.97,1102.201,1119.051,"Anyway, you all keep trying to Censor the truth and undermining our community.",22,,
141,0.97,1119.051,1122.588,"This is a public service, volunteer job that you think you are entitled to destroy our society.",22,,
142,0.97,1122.588,1123.856,You don't have the proper policies.,22,,
143,0.97,1123.856,1128.66,You don't have the proper truth to alleviate the evil that is conducting uncivil war in my community and Pioneer square every single night.,22,,
144,0.97,1128.66,1135.067,Yet you just kind of discount us like you don't have to put up with it.,22,,
145,0.97,1140.939,1151.25,"Thank you, David.",23,,
146,0.97,1152.651,1155.454,"Okay, colleagues, that concludes the number of folks signing up for public comment.",24,,

156,0.97,1201.833,1204.436,I want to note how excited I am about this piece of property.,24,,
157,0.97,1204.436,1210.008,It is a small but important piece of legislation to convey the small property Snippet that will have a large impact in creating more affordable housing.,24,,
158,0.97,1210.008,1216.548,The property transfers completely in mind with the surplus lands policy and the lands and disposition policy and follows the President's established over the last several years.,24,,
159,0.97,1216.548,1238.47,"And 2017 we passed legislation to Prioritize city-owned land and city light on property with affordable housing and emphasis on community driven projects, Pairing services with community and cultural spaces, Childcare amenities making sure we create a space for folks as we build housing for folks.",24,,
160,0.97,1238.47,1242.708,This was really intended to be a displacement mitigation strategy as well.,24,,
161,0.97,1242.708,1268.7,"This project fits that description to a T. it is family size units, Childcare space, prayer area, community space for worship and more.",24,,
162,0.97,1268.7,1272.838,Since we passed the Lane disposition policy in 2018 several properties have been conveyed at no cost for affordable housing.,24,,

234,0.97,1786.818,1787.886,I do comment and question.,35,,
235,0.97,1787.886,1807.939,Normally I would prefer to see city-owned land provided to private entities or nonprofit corporations as long-term lease like 99 year lease for one dollar year just to keep the land and the public ownership.,35,,
236,0.97,1807.939,1811.409,"But in this case looking at the map, it truly is a Snippet of land.",35,,
237,0.97,1811.409,1815.079,It truly is not a traditional parcel.,35,,
238,0.97,1815.079,1823.254,"It is just, as you showed on the map, with the blue boundary, it is really just a little bit of that Sliver of land.",35,,
239,0.97,1823.254,1834.432,"So I support this case, the disposition of these particular two items.",35,,
240,0.97,1834.432,1846.377,"I just did not want you to think that it meant that I did not continually want most land to be transferred via the 99 year lease, which lenders view as ownership frankly.",35,,
241,0.97,1846.377,1847.645,That is my comment.,35,,
242,0.97,1847.645,1867.899,"The question I have is that we don't have the benefit of having district Councilmember on this particular Committee, but with the office of housing, do you know the District Councilmember and District 2 supports this particular project?",35,,
243,0.97,1867.899,1873.838,Councilmember Morales.,35,,
244,0.97,1873.838,1884.549,I will say that I'm not aware if Councilmember Morales supports or does not support this project at the moment.,36,,
245,0.97,1884.549,1888.62,That is currently handled by the other folks in the office of housing.,36,,
246,0.97,1888.62,1900.365,I would believe given some items and things that Councilmember Morales mentioned and supported before that she might support this but I cannot speak to that directly.,36,,
247,0.97,1900.365,1908.439,I know that all of us support building more Low- income housing as part of a typical due diligence.,37,,
248,0.97,1908.439,1912.777,I would want to check in with district Councilmember.,37,,
249,0.97,1912.777,1916.247,I don't know if central staff is aware of that are not.,37,,
250,0.97,1916.247,1935.8,"I am not, Councilmember, but we can certainly drop this to the attention of Councilmember Morales that is in town now but I think she will be out of town next week . We will make sure she knows about the legislation and the project.",38,,
251,0.97,1935.8,1938.236,"Okay, great, but it looks great to me and thank you.",39,,
252,0.97,1938.236,1939.537,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",40,,

257,0.97,1962.56,1973.671,To try to prevent displacement and this is a great example of flexibility that we were hoping for with the land acquisition policy.,40,,

282,0.97,2111.776,2115.713,This is a relatively easy bill considering how complicated these bills can be.,46,,

285,0.97,2123.654,2152.049,I am Aly Pennucci with Council central staff .

286,0.97,2152.049,2165.73,"This In-Kind gift complements $500,000 grant acceptance included in the midyear grant acceptance built we will discuss next.",47,,

295,0.97,2206.671,2218.649,We looked at comparative positions within the city and that is consistent with sort of the midpoint starting point for several positions that I think would be similar to the work that this person would be doing excellent.,49,,

316,0.97,2337.301,2347.678,You were call colleagues that last year one budget change I made as chair was to move away from the quarterly supplemental and grant acceptance ordinances.,56,,
317,0.97,2347.678,2352.249,It made no sense to pass budgets four times a year trying to mend a one-year calendar your budget.,56,,
318,0.97,2352.249,2362.026,So what we have done instead is to move to the supplemental to allow for us to truly attempt to get at the yearly budgeting and then have one supplemental.,56,,
319,0.97,2362.026,2374.371,"This year we have a pretty volatile budget situation I would say with high inflation, Covid Variants . There is the Russian attack on Ukraine.",56,,
320,0.97,2374.371,2379.043,There is a lot of uncertainty in terms of whether or not there will be another recession on the horizon.,56,,
321,0.97,2379.043,2387.618,As we have mentioned there is a possibility of tough discussions and detailed scrutiny of the budget.,56,,
322,0.97,2387.618,2396.694,We will know much more one month from now when the August revenue forecast comes together.,56,,
323,0.97,2396.694,2397.428,Three things will happen.,56,,
324,0.97,2397.428,2409.874,We asked for a full accounting from the city budget office of any under spending from 2022 and asked for a full list of any federal and state dollars that were passed through the state Legislature earlier this year.,56,,
325,0.97,2409.874,2416.747,Also the Federal dollars going to go to our region via the bipartisan infrastructure Act and other Federal activities.,56,,
326,0.97,2416.747,2425.322,We also asked for full accounting of any possible general fund revenue adjacent streams that may have some flexibility.,56,,
327,0.97,2425.322,2427.992,There is a few and not just one.,56,,
328,0.97,2427.992,2441.906,We do not want to go to those general fund revenue adjacent streams or take any actions to decrease services until we see those full pictures.,56,,
329,0.97,2441.906,2452.583,"The revenue forecast, the under spending from last year, and any additional state and Federal dollars that could be available to our residents.",56,,
330,0.97,2452.583,2460.891,"But that this effort that we have today is really about making sure that we are moving forward with a supplemental budget, and ensuring we have strong oversight over the budget.",56,,
331,0.97,2460.891,2480.377,"As usual I strongly recommend and welcome any Councilmembers that are not part of this committee to go ahead and engage during the supplemental budget process, and some Councilmembers not on our Committee in finance and housing have offered amendments.",56,,
332,0.97,2480.377,2487.651,"We are happy to bring those forward with the purposes of discussion, and to make sure that everybody has their voice heard in these conversations as we consider the supplemental.",56,,
333,0.97,2487.651,2506.937,"I want to once again lift up for folks this is just the supplemental for the latter half of the year and the broader conversation, the picture we have been painting about issues on the horizon with more information known about that one month from now as we get the full picture from the revenue forecast, and other revenue streams I mentioned.",56,,
334,0.97,2506.937,2516.113,"Thank you for the work you've done on the supplemental budget, Tom and Aly.",56,,
335,0.97,2516.113,2519.416,I turn it over to you to walk us through these items in front of us.,56,,
336,0.97,2519.416,2522.686,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",57,,
337,0.97,2522.686,2536.534,I will share my screen with a presentation not posted to the agenda but just reflects the information outlined in the memo.,57,,
338,0.97,2536.534,2538.602,This is just for ease of guiding the conversation today.,57,,
339,0.97,2538.602,2542.273,With that I will turn it over to Tom and he will walk you through the discussion today.,57,,
340,0.97,2542.273,2543.874,"Thank you, deputy director.",58,,
341,0.97,2543.874,2568.399,"Good morning Madam chair, members of the committee . This morning going off the chair introduction of what we are talking about today, we are discussing specifically these Council bills, 120365, midyear grant acceptance and supplemental ordinances, and 120366.",58,,
342,0.97,2568.399,2572.703,That is adjusting the 2020 adopted budget through supplemental changes.,58,,
343,0.97,2572.703,2590.621,As deputy director mentioned there is a staff memo that has been made available in this presentation is really is pointing out the high points from that memo and we reference back to the memo as I am able for further detail.,58,,
344,0.97,2590.621,2608.806,There will also welcome any questions about that that I do not touch on the presentation that are in the memo and further in the additional items in the bill that are not specifically mentioned that need to be replaced.,58,,
345,0.97,2608.806,2622.353,"Referring to page 1 of the memo, one of the steps that staff was asked to do is to do consistent tracking of the budget changes brought to Cocounsel and to the Finance and housing committee during the year.",58,,
346,0.97,2622.353,2635.499,Earlier in the year the committee and Council received the legislation from the executive and also subsequent to that meeting there's been additional pieces of legislation.,58,,
347,0.97,2635.499,2637.901,I count nine in total.,58,,
348,0.97,2637.901,2644.675,They are detailed on page one of the staff memo . I will not cover those today.,58,,
349,0.97,2644.675,2659.556,"In the interest of time, however, the table on the slide shows you the size of the change of adjustments considered through the 15th of July.",58,,
350,0.97,2659.556,2668.699,And total the general fund adjustments including carryforwards and other legislation passed to date indicates 12% change to the general fund budget.,58,,
351,0.97,2668.699,2673.404,We provide a budget of approximately $1.8 billion.,58,,
352,0.97,2673.404,2680.544,In terms of other funds these are all the other city funds that provide services across the city.,58,,
353,0.97,2680.544,2686.717,It is a total increase of 34% and as much as $7.5 billion.,58,,
354,0.97,2686.717,2695.959,"The revised city budget of $9.2 billion, 29% overall increase.",58,,
355,0.97,2695.959,2704.768,"In reference to code these specific bills, if we could look at the next slide.",58,,
356,0.97,2704.768,2709.907,"I am sort of going to take these in reverse order and discuss the supplemental budget changes, and then follow up with the grant acceptance.",58,,
357,0.97,2709.907,2716.48,Council bill 120366 is the second copper his it budget a judgment.,58,,
358,0.97,2716.48,2728.125,That means it is All- encompassing recovering requests from an array of city departments across the city with many different detail changes included.,58,,
359,0.97,2728.125,2736.767,Also Referencing back to the state law that provides authority for this type of change to an adopted budget.,58,,
360,0.97,2736.767,2756.62,"The city is allowed or permitted to make midyear appropriation changes to positions, capital budgets and operating budgets for items end need, Unforeseeable when the 2022 budget was adopted.",58,,
361,0.97,2756.62,2770.901,"In terms of the bill itself, and the magnitude of the change that is contemplated, that would be approved with adoption of the bill, it would actually decrease city budget by total of $129 million.",58,,
362,0.97,2770.901,2779.71,One key point to make in considering that number is that a very sizable portion of technical budget adjustments included in this bill.,58,,
363,0.97,2779.71,2788.652,"And total, $222 million of appropriation reductions included.",58,,
364,0.97,2788.652,2798.028,That essentially constitutes abandonment of capital appropriations and some grants that for which work is been performed and no cash behind them.,58,,
365,0.97,2798.028,2807.004,That is essentially the Department saying they can fulfill their objectives for the year without having that budget authority.,58,,
366,0.97,2807.004,2810.707,It is really a technical adjustment.,58,,
367,0.97,2810.707,2814.144,The detail on that is discussed on page 2 of the memo.,58,,
368,0.97,2814.144,2850.28,"After netting that out you can see the supplemental budget, a request would increase the budget by total of $93.4 million . building off of the chair comments about the dynamic budget situation, and further on prior presentations to Committee, with regard to the general fund financial status which indicated $170 million projected difference between revenues and expenditures in the next year budget to provide current services.",58,,
369,0.97,2850.28,2853.217,It is really a focus of what this bill does to the general fund.,58,,
370,0.97,2853.217,2856.82,That is the next two slides this presentation will cover.,58,,
371,0.97,2856.82,2866.43,Of the $93.4 million it would increase by approximately 54.6 man dollars.,58,,
372,0.97,2866.43,2877.374,I realized I said that number but it's actually $52.6 million . that is a mistake and correct in the memo but the presentation does not follow orderly.,58,,
373,0.97,2877.374,2883.714,This shows the items of that $52.6 million proposed change.,58,,
374,0.97,2883.714,2902.366,"In the interest of understanding how it impacts the general fund given the financial situation that has been described, showing how it is paid for and what the various funding is for, and has always been in the general fund.",58,,
375,0.97,2902.366,2908.238,The first and largest change to the general fund is actual replenishment of the revenue stabilization fund referred to as the rainy day Fund.,58,,
376,0.97,2908.238,2921.618,"That is essentially a resource held for instances due to adverse economic situations, forecasted revenues did not meet budget in the general fund.",58,,
377,0.97,2921.618,2928.458,That provides essentially financial support in the vent of future problematic economic situations.,58,,
378,0.97,2928.458,2935.465,"So when it is raining the fund is available to provide the umbrella, for lack of a better word.",58,,
379,0.97,2935.465,2950.681,During the Covid pandemic in 2020 and 2021 the city budget relied on resources from the rainy day fund to meet the budget objectives in those years.,58,,
380,0.97,2950.681,2956.153,Bring the fund down to $6 million at the end of 2021.,58,,
381,0.97,2956.153,2964.928,The 2022 budget was programmed to start Replenishing the rainy day fund as the economy began to recover.,58,,
382,0.97,2964.928,2975.605,That is with approximately $15.4 million budgeted for 2022 to start that replenishment plan.,58,,
383,0.97,2975.605,2992.155,"As covered in the May 4TH presentation by the Finance and housing Committee, there was a fairly sizable gear and ending balance from the last year's activity . that is expenditures lower than budget projections and revenues that came in higher than forecasted.",58,,
384,0.97,2992.155,3000.13,The total unreserved general Fund and new balance caring into this year of 2022 was about $120 million.,58,,
385,0.97,3000.13,3014.544,The ordinance 123743 details covered at the bottom of page 2 of the memo which established the school policies for the rainy day fund or revenue stabilization fund.,58,,
386,0.97,3014.544,3026.356,"It indicates that in times when unreserved balances are available, 50% of that amount should go by ordinance to the replenishment of rainy day Fund.",58,,
387,0.97,3026.356,3041.972,"Given there is 120 B dollars available, that indicates on the order of 60 mean dollars that could go to the fund.",58,,
388,0.97,3041.972,3050.147,However to fully replace the fund only a total of approximately $54 million is necessary to replenish the fund to its full maximum funding level in 2022.,58,,
389,0.97,3050.147,3066.763,"So in this table here there is a line which is $40.3 million, paid for from the prior ending your balance and adjusting for the fact that the budget already included $15.4 million for the rainy day transfer.",58,,
390,0.97,3066.763,3073.67,This is the most Sergeant sizable item.,58,,
391,0.97,3073.67,3083.88,The assumption was included in the financial projections discussed at Committee on May 4TH . There's no impact to the bottom line numbers that were shared at that time.,58,,
392,0.97,3083.88,3097.761,There is generally a no negative impact from this to the general fund tracking back to those projections from May 4TH.,58,,
393,0.97,3097.761,3106.002,"There is a positive impact to the rainy day Fund, indicating that going into uncertain economic territory, the rainy day fund will be totally replenished with this action.",58,,
394,0.97,3106.002,3115.846,The next item I will cover is from the top of page 3 of the memo.,58,,
395,0.97,3115.846,3140.77,"There was ordinance 126453 authorizing the Mayor to enter into collective bargaining agreements including coalition of unions, fire local 27 with the International brotherhood of workers and covering vaccination requirements and providing $1750 one time payment rated for whether the workers full-time or part-time.",58,,
396,0.97,3140.77,3152.782,"For any worker that was with the city providing services on site March 20, 2020 through December 31, 2021.",58,,
397,0.97,3152.782,3161.157,"Additional criteria was the individual receiving the payment would've been on the city payroll as of August 1, 2021.",58,,
398,0.97,3161.157,3165.061,That agreement was entered into with the bargaining units.,58,,
399,0.97,3165.061,3173.904,This appropriation here provides $5.9 million to the general fund to make those payments.,58,,
400,0.97,3173.904,3179.809,There's also another piece that was covered later in the memo which is all the other city Fund.,58,,
401,0.97,3179.809,3186.316,"The city like Fund, Id Fund, Finance and administrative services Fund.",58,,
402,0.97,3186.316,3192.122,That is any fund that had staff during those time periods for which there is a payment event do.,58,,
403,0.97,3192.122,3199.629,The total amount of the frontline worker payment is nine point for me in dollars.,58,,
404,0.97,3199.629,3201.865,What is on this table is just the general fund piece.,58,,
405,0.97,3201.865,3209.573,"Referencing back to the May 4TH presentation, this amount is part of the planning Reserve and this is an executive managed Nonappropriated account.",58,,
406,0.97,3209.573,3219.683,It is where the Reserve funds for potential future liabilities covering labor contracts and other items.,58,,
407,0.97,3219.683,3221.918,So those monies were in essence set aside for this purpose.,58,,
408,0.97,3221.918,3233.463,"There's no impact to the estimated financial situation for 2023 as a result of the action, given that this money was held in reserve.",58,,
409,0.97,3233.463,3248.345,"To reflect the bill it would appropriate $2.5 million to the finest general budget, holding account in the general fund to reserve funds for future purposes, that they become more real.",59,,
410,0.97,3248.345,3265.795,This is essentially providing $2.5 million to pay for parking citations issued in 2021 by law enforcement officers who perhaps did not have correct Commission at that time to issue those tickets.,59,,
411,0.97,3265.795,3269.099,This is the 2021 obligation.,59,,
412,0.97,3269.099,3277.54,It is similar to frontline worker pay . It was held in the planning Reserve managed by the executive for that potential liability.,59,,
413,0.97,3277.54,3280.01,The next item is $3.9 million.,59,,
414,0.97,3280.01,3286.95,This touches on the Council bill 120365 which I will cover next.,59,,
415,0.97,3286.95,3297.994,This is basically the appropriations side of 3.9 B dollars worth of grants that the city would accept from external entities.,59,,
416,0.97,3297.994,3302.232,The largest item in this group is $2.27 million.,59,,
417,0.97,3302.232,3312.609,That is 2.7 main dollars Brett from the Washington Association of sheriffs for crimes against children task force.,59,,
418,0.97,3312.609,3320.717,Providing funding for salary and benefits for deputy prosecuting attorney and overtime for detectives.,59,,
419,0.97,3320.717,3325.155,Is the basic elements within SPD and city attorney office to staff that task force.,59,,
420,0.97,3325.155,3332.896,This is a regular grant that the city receives and is consistent with those past acceptances.,59,,
421,0.97,3332.896,3343.139,"There's $600,000 from Washington State Department of Transportation for public engagement process focused around Reconnecting the South Park neighborhood.",59,,
422,0.97,3343.139,3347.41,That is currently divided by state route 99.,59,,
423,0.97,3347.41,3364.027,The money provided from Wsdot would fund the plan . that would be presented to the Council and Wsdot about how to effectuate that connection of the neighborhood of Southpark.,59,,
424,0.97,3364.027,3367.664,That is January 2025.,59,,
425,0.97,3367.664,3375.038,"Going to the largest items within that grouping, the next item is actually reductions.",59,,
426,0.97,3375.038,3394.257,This is places where there are budget reductions to basically free up 2.7 main dollars of General fund cash used for other items . Actually I guess I'm talking about other proposals.,59,,
427,0.97,3394.257,3397.694,I will talk about the ads first and reductions second.,59,,
428,0.97,3397.694,3399.396,The 2.7 main dollars is across several items.,59,,
429,0.97,3399.396,3406.136,The largest is $1.1 million increase in insurance cost paid from the general fund.,59,,
430,0.97,3406.136,3422.085,"This is essentially taking our insurance bill from the general fund to $13.3 million this year, 8.7% increase to insurance premiums.",59,,
431,0.97,3422.085,3426.156,Those premium increases are largely focused on property and liability lines of business.,59,,
432,0.97,3426.156,3432.061,"There's also $500,000 increase in this other proposal line.",59,,
433,0.97,3432.061,3441.137,That two points of main dollars will provide funding to the human services Department for development of community health facility.,59,,
434,0.97,3441.137,3445.074,The item was actually added into the 2021 supplemental but not carry forward by the Department.,59,,
435,0.97,3445.074,3448.411,This essentially pulls the money back into play into the budget.,59,,
436,0.97,3448.411,3461.257,It is contingent to be confined with $1 million of General fund monies in the Department added by Council budget action in the last year budget adoption process.,59,,
437,0.97,3461.257,3468.898,Essential it provides money for the funding facility with a total of $1.5 million.,59,,
438,0.97,3468.898,3473.369,All of these items are detailed on page 4 of the memo.,59,,
439,0.97,3473.369,3490.053,"Next the $2.7 million includes the two and $50,000 increase to Hsd to expand access to reproductive health care through the enhanced access to abortion.",59,,
440,0.97,3490.053,3507.604,"The smaller item is the $175,000 Seattle center pay during the winter season between December and January of the past year . basically for workers that were on-site during that time.",59,,
441,0.97,3507.604,3531.327,"Back Finally, as I mentioned, there are two points of the main dollars worth of productions or reductions providing the funding offset for the additions I just detailed . the largest one of those is $1.6 million reduction for items budgeted in 2022 from the general fund to the Department of education early learning.",59,,
442,0.97,3531.327,3541.137,"These items are detailed on page 4 of the memo that include $500,000 for mental health services at the schools.",59,,
443,0.97,3541.137,3550.113,"$250,000 for Enhancement of restorative justice programs, $500,000 for cultural response active school planning.",59,,
444,0.97,3550.113,3556.92,"$375,000 for program for that girls and young women and Transgender youth.",59,,
445,0.97,3556.92,3559.989,That is a total of $1.6 million.,59,,
446,0.97,3559.989,3565.528,"As I mentioned, this was in the budget from the general fund.",59,,
447,0.97,3565.528,3573.136,This proposal would shift those programs and services to the family education and preschool promise Levick.,59,,
448,0.97,3573.136,3583.98,That Libby is administered and essentially these would then be paid for from that that levee using balances in that fund.,59,,
449,0.97,3583.98,3591.154,I would NOTE it was indicated by the executive that the funding was endorsed by the levee oversight committee.,59,,
450,0.97,3591.154,3606.469,"Finally, in terms of large changes, and large reductions, there is the $711,000 combined reduction to programs that were originally appropriated from the Coronavirus relief fund monies in the general fund.",59,,
451,0.97,3606.469,3614.11,We are fully Obligating and spending the refund monies.,59,,
452,0.97,3614.11,3616.98,These appropriations are essentially unnecessary to complete those programs at this time.,59,,
453,0.97,3616.98,3623.119,So all told the total is $52.6 million.,59,,
454,0.97,3623.119,3632.562,"All of these items are either paid for through the prior year ending balances, reduction of managed replenished reserves or grants.",59,,
455,0.97,3632.562,3640.103,Branch accepted in Council bill 120365 for offsetting reductions.,59,,
456,0.97,3640.103,3649.712,It keeps static the general fund projection that we discussed on May 4TH.,59,,
457,0.97,3649.712,3651.981,I will pause there to see if there are any questions.,59,,
458,0.97,3651.981,3662.191,That covers the supplemental focus . the next topic we would discuss is actually the Grantville.,59,,
459,0.97,3662.191,3665.695,I will pause here to see if there any questions for the grant bill.,59,,
460,0.97,3665.695,3666.663,Thanks.,60,,
461,0.97,3666.663,3673.036,"Where on Council bill 13066, correct, the supplemental.",60,,
462,0.97,3673.036,3673.936,Correct.,61,,
463,0.97,3673.936,3677.607,"Councilmember Pedersen, please go ahead.",62,,
464,0.97,3677.607,3683.679,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,63,,
465,0.97,3683.679,3714.51,"I want to complement the city budget office for the crafting of this midyear supplemental ordinance and also central staff for doing a terrific job breaking it down and building it back, and pointing out things that would be important to the city council in making its decision on whether to amend or approve this supplemental . I am generally in supportive of the midyear supplemental and amendments I see before us today.",63,,
466,0.97,3714.51,3718.848,I have a couple of questions about the two departments within my committee.,63,,
467,0.97,3718.848,3731.394,"That is the Seattle Department of transportation, Seattle Department of utilities . The Seattle Department of transportation, in one of the attachments it talks about amendments to the capital improvement program.",63,,
468,0.97,3731.394,3736.299,It is an attachment letter A.,63,,
469,0.97,3736.299,3741.771,The page talks about bridge seismic phase three.,63,,
470,0.97,3741.771,3754.55,"For everybody in that capital improvement attachment, it's 16 pages with minor changes that are tracked in there.",63,,
471,0.97,3754.55,3766.395,"It looks like it is saying that the last sentence, 16 bridges are part of the current phase of the program, which is funded by the levee to move to Seattle.",63,,
472,0.97,3766.395,3774.57,The executive proposing that change to strike 16 and put 11.,63,,
473,0.97,3774.57,3799.395,"I think for the public and to keep track of what is actually happening here, is that 16 bridges were originally part of the current phase of the program but that has been amended to 11 and I think that is very important to just not wipe away for forget the 16 that were promised, and to be more specific.",63,,
474,0.97,3799.395,3808.604,I'm sorry I am noticing this right now.,63,,
475,0.97,3808.604,3811.941,I was so focused on the dollar amounts that I did not notice this word change.,63,,
476,0.97,3811.941,3815.845,I may later make a voice amendment to add a few words to this know that there is context.,63,,
477,0.97,3815.845,3822.151,"It is extreme bridges that were part of this phase of the program, but it has been amended in 2022 to 11 bridges.",63,,
478,0.97,3822.151,3823.853,And then the second item --,63,,
479,0.97,3823.853,3838.968,"On that point, Councilmember Pedersen, if you're interested in a verbal amendment to clarify for the record, if you don't mind as we have this discussion, maybe confirming the central staff language.",64,,
480,0.97,3838.968,3843.706,We will work with our part to make sure that we get that done before we leave committee today.,64,,
481,0.97,3843.706,3844.54,"Yes, thank you.",65,,
482,0.97,3844.54,3845.341,"Okay, great.",66,,
483,0.97,3845.341,3849.412,"Thank you, chair.",67,,
484,0.97,3849.412,3851.881,The other item is general public utilities.,68,,
485,0.97,3851.881,3866.462,One of the largest dollar amount changes in the major supplemental is Seattle public utilities revising the capital dollars they need for their projects.,68,,
486,0.97,3866.462,3868.898,The term used is abandoned.,68,,
487,0.97,3868.898,3879.342,I was just hoping in your memo you talk about Spu no longer needing the funds.,68,,
488,0.97,3879.342,3887.183,Could you for the viewing public to get on record how Seattle public utilities works on their capital improvement program.,68,,
489,0.97,3887.183,3894.323,"They are not actually giving up $188 million, but just how they account for it.",68,,
490,0.97,3894.323,3899.095,"That's right, Councilmember Pedersen.",69,,
491,0.97,3899.095,3900.129,Take you for the question.,69,,
492,0.97,3900.129,3918.581,"I understand from the analyst Mac that staff public utilities and our conversation about the specific change, Seattle public utilities actually appropriates the full amount of capital need in each budget and so it is somewhat different than how other departments manage.",69,,
493,0.97,3918.581,3932.929,If you reference back to earlier meetings of the Finance and housing committee we discuss discussions around the carryover legislation and there was a significant amount of automatic carryforward.,69,,
494,0.97,3932.929,3942.138,A significant portion of that was capital appreciation's for capital Seattle public utilities.,69,,
495,0.97,3942.138,3952.648,It essentially appropriate the capital need for 2022 with an automatic carryforward from the prior year.,69,,
496,0.97,3952.648,3954.55,That is a consistent process for all city departments.,69,,
497,0.97,3954.55,3959.588,What they are is intellect with is a double count of the capital need for 2022 given the approach they take to the capital budget.,69,,
498,0.97,3959.588,3976.572,The change in this bill essentially removes the automatic carryforward piece so that they are basically placing their capital budget appropriation for 2022 consistent with their need and that Wipes away the carryforward amount.,69,,
499,0.97,3976.572,3979.375,"Again, that is just a different approach to capital appropriations.",69,,
500,0.97,3979.375,3990.286,But it is technically accurate and that is the essential what is going on with at large change.,69,,
501,0.97,3990.286,3990.886,Thank you.,70,,
502,0.97,3990.886,3994.156,Any additional comments?,71,,
503,0.97,3994.156,3995.758,Additional comments or questions.,72,,
504,0.97,3995.758,4001.33,I have a comment to read into the record on the half of Councilmember Herbold.,72,,
505,0.97,4001.33,4020.85,She is excuse today but wanted to know for 120366 you wanted to highlight the inclusion to the human services Department to expand access to reproductive health care through the Northwest abortion access Fund.,72,,
506,0.97,4020.85,4025.988,The prediction is that with the disastrous overturn of Roe V.,72,,
507,0.97,4025.988,4033.529,"Wade, watching the state could see 385% increase in patients from out of state seeking reproductive care here.",72,,
508,0.97,4033.529,4037.199,This is enough to flood clinics across the state.,72,,
509,0.97,4037.199,4039.034,That includes right here in the city of Seattle.,72,,
510,0.97,4039.034,4055.384,"Meanwhile a recent poll showed not only strong support for abortion access here, but it also found 62% of residents support efforts to help people from other states receive Abortio access here in our state.",72,,
511,0.97,4055.384,4058.22,This is exactly what these funds will do.,72,,
512,0.97,4058.22,4084.113,"In made the Seattle city council passed a resolution that called for adding funding to support abortion access this year . After consulting with abortion access advocates and public health, Councilmember Herbold offered an amendment to direct the dollars to the Northwest abortion access fund to provide logistical support, care and safety for people seeking abortions here in Seattle from out of state.",72,,
513,0.97,4084.113,4099.161,"Councilmember Herbold notes, I think and thank Councilmember Herbold for answering the call to receive and include $250,000 in the supplemental budget.",72,,
514,0.97,4099.161,4107.937,I call my colleagues Deceitfully swiftly support the full monies include.,72,,
515,0.97,4107.937,4112.708,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",72,,
516,0.97,4112.708,4118.414,Seeing no more comments Online or in person I go ahead--excuse me.,72,,
517,0.97,4118.414,4129.892,"Tom, do you mind if we take action on this separate from the other bill and get this forward, or do we need to do them together?",72,,
518,0.97,4129.892,4147.343,"Chair Mosqueda, it's fine to take them up separately but three minutes are related to this bill . We can skip ahead to those lines if you would like to take up those amendments first, but you would want to consider a menace before moving or taking the final vote on the supplemental bill.",73,,
519,0.97,4147.343,4150.246,Let's just go ahead and break the other one.,74,,
520,0.97,4150.246,4152.047,I want to double check my notes as well.,74,,
521,0.97,4152.047,4158.387,"Let's go ahead and brief the grant acceptance ordinance, please.",74,,
522,0.97,4158.387,4161.69,Thank you.,75,,
523,0.97,4161.69,4168.264,Council bill 120365 is the first conference of grant acceptance bill.,75,,
524,0.97,4168.264,4169.465,That is for this year.,75,,
525,0.97,4169.465,4181.744,That would authorize the city departments to accept approximately 67.6 main dollars from external sources.,75,,
526,0.97,4181.744,4190.92,Of the total amount 80% from the Washington State Department of social and human services for an array of ages the programs.,75,,
527,0.97,4190.92,4192.955,Hsd programs.,75,,
528,0.97,4192.955,4210.272,There is technical consideration in this acceptance that is approximately half of the grant accepted into the Hsd already appropriated into 2022 without the budget.,75,,
529,0.97,4210.272,4217.546,The appropriates authority for the second half of grants have been requested in the supplemental bill that we previously discussed.,75,,
530,0.97,4217.546,4227.756,This is a new approach that is spearheaded . I wanted to point that out since this is a new approach they are taking with regard to accepting the grants.,75,,
531,0.97,4227.756,4247.376,I would note that staff has reviewed these various acceptances and did not flag any items of concern for the things that were accepted or that would be accepted if the passage of 120365.,75,,
532,0.97,4247.376,4265.427,I believe that covers my comments that the memo provides a bit more detail on some individual grants . that is on pages six through eight . that includes the full table of the grant acceptance is by Department.,75,,
533,0.97,4265.427,4279.141,That is a summary of the individual grant acceptance is already included in the summary attachment a to the ordinance.,75,,
534,0.97,4279.141,4293.455,That concludes the full discussions of both bills with regards to the amendments to Council bill 120366.,75,,
535,0.97,4293.455,4294.256,"I apologize, folks.",76,,

627,0.97,4824.119,4827.589,"Thank you, Madam chair.",103,,
628,0.97,4827.589,4853.715,As disgusting Council briefing and may have been two weeks ago one Councilmember Herbold and I made comments to the effect that the money allocated in the budget for triage one or at least a portion of that money could be Reprogrammed as part of our ongoing work with the executive to set up some kind of pilot for alternative 911 response.,103,,
629,0.97,4853.715,4876.238,It is evident that triage one is not going to be a model pursued by Councilmember Herbold team but certainly that's an amount of appropriation could form some kind of a pilot program that is more in line with the vision and goal of the Mayor Harrell administration and this policy area.,103,,
630,0.97,4876.238,4887.082,I am probably Straying a little bit into central staff care to explain the amendment.,103,,
631,0.97,4887.082,4896.491,But it would move the money into Finance general in order to preserve the opportunity to program it at some point this year for some kind of alternative response.,103,,
632,0.97,4896.491,4912.307,It could be we pursue instead to do this through the budget in which case this triage one money could be essentially used as part of the balancing for 2022 final budget gap.,103,,
633,0.97,4912.307,4930.926,But this preserves our options and flexibility to work with the administration from Mayor Harrell to put together the pilot to inform the ongoing work to meet the Charter public safety obligations of the city.,103,,
634,0.97,4930.926,4933.395,So with that I think a will turn over to central staff.,103,,
635,0.97,4933.395,4935.664,I may have a few comments after the central staff presentation.,103,,
636,0.97,4935.664,4937.098,Thank you very much.,104,,
637,0.97,4937.098,4941.936,Go ahead and add to that central staff.,105,,
638,0.97,4941.936,4951.68,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda, and Councilmember Lewis.",106,,
639,0.97,4951.68,4955.116,I don't have a lot to add because Councilmember Lewis covered it pretty thoroughly.,106,,
640,0.97,4955.116,4963.992,"To reiterate, the funds originally provided to the Seattle fire Department and the 2022 adopted proposal for the triage one program that we understand to stop moving for.",106,,
641,0.97,4963.992,4977.572,"It reserves the funds for the same purpose generally, supporting alternative response, but provides time and space for Council and Mayor to determine the appropriate Department or program for those investments.",106,,
642,0.97,4977.572,4992.354,I will note that the funds are assumed to be part of or were part of the assumptions going into the August discussions about anticipated carryforward into 2023 to help address the projected general fund budget.,106,,
643,0.97,4992.354,4994.622,Moving them to finance general this not necessarily change that.,106,,
644,0.97,4994.622,5003.531,"It is a signal that it may be priority for Council to investigate or invest the fund into 2022, and then they would be available to spend in 2020.",106,,
645,0.97,5003.531,5015.31,"However, policy decisions are not made before the Council budget funding this fall it would be presumed to be part of the starting fund for 2023.",106,,
646,0.97,5015.31,5016.177,Okay.,107,,
647,0.97,5016.177,5021.716,"Any additional comments, Councilmember Nelson.",107,,
648,0.97,5021.716,5024.552,Do you know if we have spoken to the fire Department about this?,108,,
649,0.97,5024.552,5032.594,"I don't know how restricted or how limited the definition of what those funds to be used for, for triage one.",108,,
650,0.97,5032.594,5040.301,Do you know that they are facing staffing issues with 911 response or whatever?,108,,
651,0.97,5040.301,5048.476,I'm just wanting to know if we got the nod from the fire Department.,108,,
652,0.97,5048.476,5052.147,"Maybe I will add to that, Councilmember Lewis, and turn it over to you for additional context.",109,,
653,0.97,5052.147,5058.052,"Councilmember Nelson, a good question that helps to bring up issues that we are facing prior to your arrival on this Council.",109,,
654,0.97,5058.052,5074.436,"Recognizing that I think that midyear last year, then Mayor Jenny Durkan sit down a package of items that were a lot of surprises to a lot of people including fire Department in frontline I have 27 members.",109,,
655,0.97,5074.436,5087.549,When I asked our friends at Iaf 27 not to be confused with health one or the vans and what we have expanded across the city in partnership with the fire Department.,109,,
656,0.97,5087.549,5093.455,The triage one constant was not very well stay colder.,109,,
657,0.97,5093.455,5108.203,I think it was clear from my discussion with frontline personnel that they were really concerned about yet another set of personnel expected to go out in triage with no place to send people.,109,,
658,0.97,5108.203,5111.506,The word we continue to hear was there needs to be a landing zone for people.,109,,
659,0.97,5111.506,5118.68,Triage one is not something I think that had tremendous amount of input from them.,109,,
660,0.97,5118.68,5125.653,I'm not trying to speak on their behalf but I echo their concerns which I heard back then.,109,,
661,0.97,5125.653,5127.922,Triage one completely new system setup is not a value add.,109,,
662,0.97,5127.922,5137.999,Something like what Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Herbold said quite a bit and discuss now for near 304 years.,109,,
663,0.97,5137.999,5142.437,It's all that we know as a value add and they need resources.,109,,
664,0.97,5142.437,5153.715,"Not putting words in their mouth but in context where the frontline personnel were at in concept of triage one proposal, is not a top party.",109,,
665,0.97,5153.715,5155.35,"Councilmember Lewis, would you add anything to that?",109,,
666,0.97,5155.35,5155.75,Yes.,110,,
667,0.97,5155.75,5164.792,"The best way to describe this money, it happens to be in the fire Department.",110,,
668,0.97,5164.792,5168.029,It is not money that the fire Department was expecting to use for any other purpose.,110,,
669,0.97,5168.029,5172.567,There is no concern I am aware of from the fire Department in moving this money.,110,,
670,0.97,5172.567,5194.722,"The Mayor Durkan administration when conceived of the triage one idea in the summer of 2021, decided to put it in the fire Department for lack of them conceiving of a better potential place to develop the triage one pilot in 2022.",110,,
671,0.97,5194.722,5214.242,The Bruce Harrell administration obviously had a sort of different concepts on how to structure this work which does not envision as I understand it the fire Department being able to develop an alternative 911 response.,110,,
672,0.97,5214.242,5220.615,So there is not any problematic issue with moving this.,110,,
673,0.97,5220.615,5229.657,It will not impact the bottom line or the business model of the fire Department in any way that I am aware of.,110,,
674,0.97,5229.657,5231.459,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Lewis.",111,,
675,0.97,5231.459,5247.342,"I would add, Councilmember Nelson, your concern around making sure that personnel within fire had the support they need, huge party of mine over the last two years.",111,,
676,0.97,5247.342,5250.144,With added additional support in terms of personnel and mental health counseling resources.,111,,
677,0.97,5250.144,5259.821,Both at the Seattle fire Department and within Iff 27.,111,,
678,0.97,5259.821,5270.865,If there's anything you would like to add in with fire Department and supplemental but that is a party for me as well with the upcoming budget to make sure that frontline fire get the additional support they need.,111,,
679,0.97,5270.865,5273.134,This is something we have seen attrition in this area as well.,111,,
680,0.97,5273.134,5279.507,This is not had as much attention so I will look at this area as well.,111,,
681,0.97,5279.507,5283.444,With that I know there will be more conversations to come about how to support our frontline fire personnel.,111,,
682,0.97,5283.444,5290.985,"Councilmember Nelson, or if anything from central staff, you're welcome to join in.",111,,
683,0.97,5290.985,5291.352,Okay.,112,,
684,0.97,5291.352,5295.79,It is clear that triage one was not ready for prime time so makes history appropriate that money.,112,,
685,0.97,5295.79,5303.931,I hope the fire Department and local 27 would agree this is fine.,112,,
686,0.97,5303.931,5309.037,That these dollars are not already being counted on for this frontline workers.,112,,
687,0.97,5309.037,5309.671,Well said.,113,,
688,0.97,5309.671,5329.457,"Anything else from central staff on the item? seeing shaking of the head no and no additional comments, Allison go ahead, Councilmember Lewis.",113,,
689,0.97,5329.457,5331.025,I one last comment on central staff.,114,,
690,0.97,5331.025,5335.329,"On my review on appropriations from triage one, it looks like the total number was $1.9 million put into the budget.",114,,
691,0.97,5335.329,5340.001,"In my not remembering that correctly, or with some of that money already Reappropriated, or moved?",114,,
692,0.97,5340.001,5343.838,How do we get to the 1.2 number?,114,,
693,0.97,5343.838,5353.548,"Councilmember Lewis, I will have all of the Spreadsheets in front of me, but I get them from this with the analyst that stops at this area.",115,,
694,0.97,5353.548,5361.689,There was an initial proposed add with some reductions to that proposal in a separate amendment.,115,,
695,0.97,5361.689,5364.592,You have to take both actions together that ultimately left 1.2 men dollars.,115,,
696,0.97,5364.592,5367.495,We will triple check that following committee.,115,,
697,0.97,5367.495,5376.671,If that was in error we will make a technical correction and in advance of the city council discussion on Tuesday.,115,,
698,0.97,5376.671,5377.105,Great.,116,,
699,0.97,5377.105,5386.481,"Would also add for future budget implications, I did have--this is just an additional bit of context for developing this over the course of the rest of there.",116,,
700,0.97,5386.481,5403.698,"I did asked about a month ago for Greg Doss and Council central staff to prepare a summary, spreadsheet summary of what that might approximately cost to do a pilot along the lines of what is envisioned for alternative response.",116,,
701,0.97,5403.698,5411.072,"That number came back at about $948,000.",116,,
702,0.97,5411.072,5427.922,"It's possible that number could be driven far lower based on some of the assumptions that the Mayor Durkan administration made for triage one pilot in terms of, for example, including a quarter million dollars is monthly rent based on where you based that program out of.",116,,
703,0.97,5427.922,5439.1,It is possible we are taking advantage of existing city facilities or something of that nature.,116,,
704,0.97,5439.1,5449.21,"I wanted to flag even though number removing 1.2 million, there could be the actual scope pilot what it would run and that number.",116,,
705,0.97,5449.21,5453.848,I just wanted to flag that additional bit of context from our central staff.,116,,
706,0.97,5453.848,5458.653,"With that, Madam chair, I don't have anything else to add.",116,,
707,0.97,5458.653,5462.89,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Lewis.",117,,
708,0.97,5462.89,5466.594,"Madam chair, please call the roll for adoption of the amendment number two.",117,,
709,0.97,5466.594,5474.735,"[roll being called .] that is four in favor, none opposed.",118,,
710,0.97,5474.735,5483.01,Thank you very much.,119,,
711,0.97,5483.01,5485.947,Amendment number two will carry in the amendment is adopted to the supplemental budget.,119,,
712,0.97,5485.947,5490.952,Amendment number three in front of us and a sponsor of the bill I suggested to Councilmember Morales that I would bring it forward.,119,,
713,0.97,5490.952,5496.991,I will be doing that as a courtesy to her . We do have some concerns as we have learned late yesterday.,119,,
714,0.97,5496.991,5498.025,I want to flag that.,119,,
715,0.97,5498.025,5505.633,"On her behalf, and I don't see her in the same.",119,,
716,0.97,5505.633,5508.302,I want to make sure that she is not in the waiting room.,119,,
717,0.97,5508.302,5508.603,Okay.,119,,
718,0.97,5508.603,5520.448,On behalf of Councilmember Morales I moved to amend Council bill as in amendment number three.,119,,
719,0.97,5520.448,5521.082,Second.,120,,
720,0.97,5521.082,5521.482,Okay.,121,,
721,0.97,5521.482,5531.726,They could very much . has been moved and Seconded.,121,,
722,0.97,5531.726,5534.996,I'm going to turned over to central staff to address this and walk us through it.,121,,
723,0.97,5534.996,5536.831,I will walk through some comments that we have.,121,,
724,0.97,5536.831,5542.336,"Great, thank you, chair Mosqueda.",122,,
725,0.97,5542.336,5544.438,I apologize for taking the document on and off the screen.,122,,
726,0.97,5544.438,5549.31,Was trying to get the Councilmember Pedersen verbal amendment ready to show on the screen.,122,,
727,0.97,5549.31,5551.746,That is the reason it was going back and forth.,122,,
728,0.97,5551.746,5568.863,"This amendment authored by Councilmember Morales adding $75,000 to the human services fund to provide outreach services in support of the Chinatown-International district and the little Saigon neighbors safety model.",122,,
729,0.97,5568.863,5577.471,"This provides funding to provide dedicated outreach staff for four months, September through December.",122,,
730,0.97,5577.471,5578.873,That would complement existing outreach activities.,122,,
731,0.97,5578.873,5588.582,This again with the funded to an outside organization that indicated that the funding would be sufficient to find those position.,122,,
732,0.97,5588.582,5594.021,I do not have details about specificity or exact salary so what those positions are.,122,,
733,0.97,5594.021,5601.562,We have Amy Gore on the line but I don't think she has those details leaders.,122,,
734,0.97,5601.562,5610.705,The proposed expenditure would use one time 2021 ending balances from the general fund that Tom described previously available.,122,,
735,0.97,5610.705,5616.41,Otherwise to address the projected general fund shortfall of 2023.,122,,
736,0.97,5616.41,5634.628,This is likely typically when staff are funded it becomes an ongoing obligation for the organization to request the city funded through the general fund.,122,,
737,0.97,5634.628,5640.167,I find that in the spirit of the ongoing conversations that this Committee is engaged in regarding the position of the general fund projecting going into 2023.,122,,
738,0.97,5640.167,5642.203,"Aly, I did not quite understand that last sentence.",123,,
739,0.97,5642.203,5644.972,You were trailing off a little bit . The mind saying that again?,123,,
740,0.97,5644.972,5646.54,I will ask my questions in a moment.,123,,
741,0.97,5646.54,5652.68,"Sure, happy to and sorry.",124,,
742,0.97,5652.68,5670.664,So these funds used 2022--this to be funded using what we are assuming is the carryforward from the 2021 ending balances of funds that came in or revenues that came in overprotection as well as appropriations not expended last year.,124,,
743,0.97,5670.664,5680.441,This would reduce the starting balance that we were assuming for 2023.,124,,
744,0.97,5680.441,5689.984,It may also result in an ongoing request to provide funding to this Organization for these two positions.,124,,
745,0.97,5689.984,5692.987,Okay.,125,,
746,0.97,5692.987,5694.088,Councilmember Lewis has a question.,125,,
747,0.97,5694.088,5695.056,"Thank you, Madam chair.",126,,
748,0.97,5695.056,5703.097,I am just trying to understand exactly what this could do in practice.,126,,
749,0.97,5703.097,5711.038,It sort of reads like we would be doing essentially an expansion to the outreach contract.,126,,
750,0.97,5711.038,5714.041,It is worded in such a way to be neutral obviously.,126,,
751,0.97,5714.041,5724.652,"Independent of like a bit, but I guess I'm just kind of wondering exactly how this is going to be implemented.",126,,
752,0.97,5724.652,5737.898,"With this money go to the King County regional homelessness authority, which I would imagine would hold this contract, or is it envisioned to be directly Rfp by human services Department?",126,,
753,0.97,5737.898,5743.304,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",127,,
754,0.97,5743.304,5749.477,I believe the intent is for it to be contracted directly from Hsd to the organization.,127,,
755,0.97,5749.477,5772.299,It's more in the safe and thriving community division of human services Department versus the addressing homelessness division that contracts with the King County homelessness authority.,127,,
756,0.97,5772.299,5774.802,I invite my colleagues to correct me if that assumption is not right.,127,,
757,0.97,5774.802,5776.437,I do not have anything to add.,128,,
758,0.97,5776.437,5782.143,"It is supporting what is called the Chinatown-International district, and little Saigon neighborhood safety model proposal.",128,,
759,0.97,5782.143,5785.212,It is primarily thought of as a public safety investment.,128,,
760,0.97,5785.212,5785.646,00 program.,128,,
761,0.97,5785.646,5797.992,That was why it was written to send the funding to Hsd for direct contract with the community.,128,,
762,0.97,5797.992,5803.13,"Can I have a follow-up, Madam chair.",129,,
763,0.97,5803.13,5810.671,With the descriptions of the activities that seem to be the types of outreach activities that we envision the homelessness authority contracting for.,129,,
764,0.97,5810.671,5829.523,"The description in the amendment bio reads outreach activities to include harm reduction and survival support, relationship building with unfiltered residence, and they have outreach in connection with services.",129,,
765,0.97,5829.523,5836.263,"I guess I'm just curious in terms of how it is Crafted, and where it is going.",129,,
766,0.97,5836.263,5844.038,Has the Department kind of waived in.,129,,
767,0.97,5844.038,5859.486,In reviewing the materials before the committee was the first time I have kind of seen this . I can speak certainly speak directly to the need and the Chinatown-International district for this type of outreach.,129,,
768,0.97,5859.486,5868.996,I think it is just a matter of thinking through exactly how to bring it up and get it out there.,129,,
769,0.97,5868.996,5886.146,As the human services Department kind of responded on how this is structured and does it sort of fit with what they think that their current line items of business and homelessness outreach are?,129,,
770,0.97,5886.146,5907.434,"My understanding for the entire program is that it has been developed in coordination with representatives from city staff being present, particularly like the on, Spu, Sdot, and some other departments.",130,,
771,0.97,5907.434,5912.106,I have not heard from and 30 about this particular component of the entire program.,130,,
772,0.97,5912.106,5920.714,"How they would, you know, in their kind of opinion about that, I've not heard that from them yet.",130,,
773,0.97,5920.714,5942.069,"I would just add here that by proposing to appropriate the funding to the support of the state immunity budget summary level, it is a signal from the Council that their intent is for this contract to be managed by the human services Department rather than the homelessness authority.",131,,
774,0.97,5942.069,5948.609,Ultimately it is an administrative decision that is the power of the executive.,131,,
775,0.97,5948.609,5978.906,"If they decide to move forward with contracting for these funds, and think that the regional homelessness authority is a more appropriate path, to move that forward, they would either need to propose a change in a future supplemental budget bill or use . There's some flexibility the budget director has to move the funding between those under certain dollar amount if they determined that necessary.",131,,
776,0.97,5978.906,5980.007,"Madam chair, mail follow-up?",132,,
777,0.97,5980.007,5984.078,"Yes, Councilmember Lewis.",133,,
778,0.97,5984.078,5998.425,"I want us to be really, really careful Problematically with any potential redundancies in how we are doing--this is a homelessness outreach program.",134,,
779,0.97,5998.425,6003.831,I'm just going to say that based on the description and the amendment.,134,,
780,0.97,6003.831,6006.5,It is a very worthy one and one that we should be doing.,134,,
781,0.97,6006.5,6012.172,I would like to work with the sponsor on how we can bring it up as part of our partnership with the King County regional homelessness authority.,134,,
782,0.97,6012.172,6022.649,I don't know if the supporting safe community is the ideal place to put this.,134,,
783,0.97,6022.649,6027.721,I want us to be careful about creating a redundant homelessness services bureaucracy within the city.,134,,
784,0.97,6027.721,6050.177,"I certainly want to encourage outreach and support these efforts and these models, but I would like for us to have a conversation with the sponsor about how we might start to this to do that work through what we have established as our future platform to pay for those services.",134,,
785,0.97,6050.177,6051.278,"Councilmember Lewis, well said.",135,,
786,0.97,6051.278,6055.516,Any additional comments?,135,,
787,0.97,6055.516,6056.583,"Councilmember Nelson, please go ahead.",135,,
788,0.97,6056.583,6058.218,Thank you very much.,136,,
789,0.97,6058.218,6063.724,I will be voting against this amendment because for couple of reasons.,136,,
790,0.97,6063.724,6079.64,"First of all, he does not seem to meet the criteria for the test that items in the supplemental budget are there to meet needs assumed to be Unforeseeable when the 2022 budget was adopted from the presentation earlier.",136,,
791,0.97,6079.64,6090.551,Councilmember Lewis's questions indicate that we don't really have that much understanding of the design of the program.,136,,
792,0.97,6090.551,6095.656,"I had questions about whether or not $75,000 to be spent by the end of the year.",136,,
793,0.97,6095.656,6105.099,There's also a lack of clarity about is this and it does a read like homelessness outreach.,136,,
794,0.97,6105.099,6129.957,"That is definitely needed and there are several neighborhood organizations that do have, for example, the District partnership at Ballard, Soto . I believe we have one at the CD in first Hill . date share homeless outreach coordinator.",136,,
795,0.97,6129.957,6143.637,I think we need to be conference it or systematic in how we add this work to work already done and look at models that work and go forward probably next year with the more rushed out program.,136,,
796,0.97,6143.637,6144.037,If necessary.,136,,
797,0.97,6144.037,6169.329,"I will say that on the safety front, coming out of my meeting in the economic development Committee, the business improvement area representatives have been working with Andrew Mayor Berke on the never safety Coordinators that would do some of the work that was identified as necessary and so they have been continuing discussions.",136,,
798,0.97,6169.329,6180.173,All very important work and let's talk about it when we have an opportunity to flush out the details.,136,,
799,0.97,6180.173,6181.208,Thank you very much.,137,,
800,0.97,6181.208,6183.243,Not seeing any additional hand in the room or Online.,137,,
801,0.97,6183.243,6190.817,I will be following the chair of homelessness and public assets here today as well.,137,,
802,0.97,6190.817,6206.6,I want to thank Councilmember Morales . I know that her team is done a lot of work in the Cid and with many community members we work with as well to talk about the highest needs.,137,,
803,0.97,6206.6,6207.634,I do support this concept.,137,,
804,0.97,6207.634,6209.836,But also support the concept we heard about in public safety.,137,,
805,0.97,6209.836,6214.775,That was a few minutes ago with the Hub and spoke model.,137,,
806,0.97,6214.775,6228.722,I'm forgetting the name of it but the various hubs around the city were Councilmember Nelson noted the needs of the areas.,137,,
807,0.97,6228.722,6231.758,"I appreciate what Councilmember have said to date, that there is a need for this.",137,,
808,0.97,6231.758,6236.063,It seems like the emphasis an important and in this work to be in conjunction of the longer term funding process.,137,,
809,0.97,6236.063,6247.107,"I would hate for there to be a short time impression that there would be funding with no actual action to put the dollars out the door in the next six-month process, and did not have it come to fruition in the next year budget.",137,,
810,0.97,6247.107,6255.248,It seems to be in need of a broader conversation in the 2023-2024 budget.,137,,
811,0.97,6255.248,6268.362,Councilmember Lewis appropriately noted in conjunction with the homelessness authority recognizing the intersection and some of the work that our partners like trying to do with some really high needs folks in the community.,137,,
812,0.97,6268.362,6292.219,"So in addition to needing to be consistent with the one time funding concerns I've had about other pills that have come before us, and the value of the legislation just like the value of this amendment, am supportive of the content but also concerned about the ongoing revenue needs that we need to discuss in the next year built without having a full funding source directly for this fully flushed out.",137,,
813,0.97,6292.219,6300.594,I think we will make sure this is part of the larger conversation and this falls into the process and I did emphasize my support for the concept.,137,,
814,0.97,6300.594,6308.301,"Councilmember Morales, I will continue to do so in the upcoming budget for this fall and in partnership with community members who have clearly articulated a need.",137,,
815,0.97,6308.301,6310.737,We need to make sure it is actually funded regularly.,137,,
816,0.97,6310.737,6320.38,We will have more section about that this fall but unfortunately I will not be voting to support this today.,137,,
817,0.97,6320.38,6324.451,"Emotion is in front of us Madame clerk, will you please call the roll on amendment number three Mac.",137,,
818,0.97,6324.451,6331.425,[roll being called.],138,,

821,0.97,6341.335,6348.909,I'm sure more support for the concept but the amendment does not carry.,140,,
822,0.97,6348.909,6364.524,"Councilmember Pedersen, I understand you would like to make a verbal amendment rusted for us today and I believe they have this ready to pull up on screen as well.",141,,
823,0.97,6364.524,6368.795,Our Council rules allow verbal amendment sector many but it is ideal to have them prepared in advance.,142,,
824,0.97,6368.795,6374.067,Thank you for your grace and letting me bring this forward now.,142,,
825,0.97,6374.067,6377.337,"Hollies, please don't forward these amendments to the transportation committee.",142,,
826,0.97,6377.337,6386.747,This is basically just amending a sentence that is in the capital improvement program regarding the breach seismic programs.,142,,
827,0.97,6386.747,6412.606,The current version before us is striking the 16 bridges originally promised but to add a little bit of clarity I will want to keep the 16 in there but say it has been amended to 11 just so the public sees the entire story that it was fair and was 16 but now 11.,142,,
828,0.97,6412.606,6416.743,I will go ahead and make this motion and then I will restate the sentence so that it is clear.,142,,

830,0.97,6419.379,6421.248,"Yes, please go ahead and move the amendment.",143,,
831,0.97,6421.248,6428.922,"I moved to amend Council bill 120366, attachment eight breach seismic phase three page.",144,,
832,0.97,6428.922,6431.992,The last things in the description.,144,,

834,0.97,6448.408,6457.551,That way the sense will read 16 bridges were part of the current phase of the program funded by the levy to move Seattle but this was amended to 11 bridges.,144,,
835,0.97,6457.551,6470.43,Councilmember Pedersen has moved to amend the attachment a to indicate 16 bridges were part of the current phase of the program which is funded by the levy to move Seattle.,145,,

903,0.97,6891.084,6904.23,The city conducted racial equity Toolkit at the Finance Committee and they had a presentation on it and heard about it from some of the public comments at the beginning of this meeting.,160,,
904,0.97,6904.23,6919.779,"In broad brush strokes, the racial equity Toolkit concluded that there are significant inequities for communities calls primarily by the war on drugs.",160,,
905,0.97,6919.779,6926.619,That is a Federal policy and series of programs that are at many governmental levels.,160,,

912,0.97,6983.443,7001.227,We are looking at deep bridges in the fabric of our community layered on miscommunication and inequitable practices on workers across many industries but in particular the Cannabis industry.,161,,
913,0.97,7001.227,7011.537,Keep in mind there are limitations to what the city can do in this space.,161,,
914,0.97,7011.537,7014.006,One thing we can do is to work toward equity in licensing.,161,,
915,0.97,7014.006,7028.287,We understand the state issued or intended on issuing a series of social equity licenses at the state level for the washing the state liquor and Cannabis board . The city as a hand and licensing.,161,,

921,0.97,7062.088,7071.697,The first is worker retention and transparency piece of legislation brought to us by the good folks at the office of labor standards and central staff.,161,,
922,0.97,7071.697,7079.305,A bill brought to us by the Finance and administrative services addresses the social equity licenses issue by the city.,161,,

924,0.97,7086.813,7093.386,Next slide.,161,,
925,0.97,7093.386,7094.32,Worker retention and transparency.,161,,
926,0.97,7094.32,7110.036,"It was brought to my attention that one big challenge in the industry is no exactly the boss is and who to hold accountable for the labor standards we already have on the books, making sure that folks are getting their wages in a timely manner and feel safe in their workplaces.",161,,
927,0.97,7110.036,7116.542,We partnered with Ols and central staff to use language we have seen before but not many surprises here.,161,,
928,0.97,7116.542,7125.818,We are asking to post a notification of who exactly holds the Seattle business licenses in each Cannabis store.,161,,
929,0.97,7125.818,7131.591,Everyone in play will know exactly who to held accountable as employer.,161,,
930,0.97,7131.591,7133.926,Will also look at retention policy familiar to many Council members.,161,,
931,0.97,7133.926,7145.805,Earlier we worked on the suite of legislation to protect hotel workers around retention.,161,,
932,0.97,7145.805,7153.646,Often in Seattle business licenses moving between owners and during that transition the stability of the workforce in Cannabis industry meaningfully disrupted and quite a bit of turnover.,161,,
933,0.97,7153.646,7157.884,This legislation tends to address stability for workers in the workplace with 90 day retention with exemptions for calls.,161,,
934,0.97,7157.884,7164.223,But when the boss changes the work and staff have to.,161,,
935,0.97,7164.223,7177.37,We want to make sure they are stabilized during that economic transaction and that it could all be enforced by private right of action and through the office of labor standards that made it clear they are prepared to Helpus enforce this body of work.,161,,
936,0.97,7177.37,7178.738,Okay.,162,,
937,0.97,7178.738,7193.019,The second piece of legislation in the suite Abeles is a proposal to create a new social equity applicant category of Seattle Cannabis licenses.,162,,
938,0.97,7193.019,7198.291,This is consistent with racial equity Toolkit recommendations.,162,,
939,0.97,7198.291,7208.367,The social equity applicant definition is going to be provided . I can give a summary of that.,162,,
940,0.97,7208.367,7225.918,The bill will indicate that it must be a business that has majority ownership by owners living in Culinary that is disproportionately or has been disproportionately impacted by the Federal war on drugs.,162,,
941,0.97,7225.918,7255.381,"The ownership by one or more persons who have been convicted of a drug offense, and or other considerations to be flushed out in the future directors rules, informed by the washing the state liquor and Cannabis boards deliberations about a state level social equity applicant procedure.",162,,
942,0.97,7255.381,7262.755,The bill that will be transmitted next week would also increase the--I'm sorry.,162,,
943,0.97,7262.755,7271.197,"Before I finish with social equity applicants, those that qualify for still equity--social equity would have a No- cost city license.",162,,
944,0.97,7271.197,7286.812,The other applicants or other license holders who are seeking an annual city Cannabis license would pay $4000 in lieu of the current $3500 fee.,162,,
945,0.97,7286.812,7290.549,So there would be a $500 increase.,162,,
946,0.97,7290.549,7319.045,"The final item in this bill is that ancillary businesses, if approved by the washing the state liquor and Cannabis board would be eligible for receiving a city license . The details on such a program of potential ancillary Cannabis businesses is to be determined by the state.",162,,
947,0.97,7319.045,7328.821,We would have a lot more discussion about sites and other consideration.,162,,
948,0.97,7328.821,7336.529,Ancillary Cannabis businesses as one example could include consumption allowances.,162,,
949,0.97,7336.529,7353.345,"That is why we will want to have a lot more discussion about where such ancillary business to be located and who could on it, and how is it connected or is it not connected with license holding in the retail space.",162,,
950,0.97,7353.345,7365.491,"Finally, we are just acknowledging that this is the beginning steps of multiple steps that the city intends to take.",162,,
951,0.97,7365.491,7379.572,We want to Memorialize the future steps that we know that we want to take in the Near- term.,162,,
952,0.97,7379.572,7386.545,"That includes Partnering with King County and other jurisdictions to allow expunging prior Cannabis convictions, something the city cannot do for other jurisdictions by itself.",162,,
953,0.97,7386.545,7392.518,But we can advocate for and partner with other jurisdictions.,162,,
954,0.97,7392.518,7405.865,We intend to work with impacted communities on approaches to build wealth through management jobs and ownership of Cannabis businesses in the industry.,162,,
955,0.97,7405.865,7412.605,"Again, acknowledging that this is a series of first steps and that there is more work to do.",162,,
956,0.97,7412.605,7433.492,"One of the things that we have been planning on and expect to do in the coming months, is to stand up and advisory committee of workers and industry members, and community members, that have been impacted by the Federal war on drugs.",162,,
957,0.97,7433.492,7453.879,"They will help us cope and receive, and make--give advice about next steps on a needs assessment to help us identify the highest needs of workers, and recommendations for addressing those needs.",162,,
958,0.97,7453.879,7467.726,"Just for the listing public, you will be able to see this legislation hopefully if everything goes well, and we will transmit it from the Mayor's office next Wednesday, July 27.",163,,
959,0.97,7467.726,7474.133,If Mike Council calendar map holds you should be able to sit on the introduction referral calendar the following Monday.,163,,
960,0.97,7474.133,7485.878,We are working with Councilmember Mosqueda.,163,,
961,0.97,7491.65,7493.853,Thank you to the counseling Committee for keeping this bill moving.,163,,
962,0.97,7493.853,7497.089,We are familiar with the budget cycle and do not want to step on those toes.,163,,
963,0.97,7497.089,7499.725,We are prepared to be available to answer any of your questions.,163,,
964,0.97,7499.725,7509.535,I will reach out tomorrow to each of your offices to offer the brief on the full suite of legislation to make sure we on the same page and that everyone has the information they need to make a decision on the suite Abeles.,163,,
965,0.97,7509.535,7513.038,With that if there any questions we can answer today from the higher level this is the time.,163,,
966,0.97,7513.038,7514.64,You very much.,164,,
967,0.97,7514.64,7519.245,Thank you for the presentation on a high level.,164,,
968,0.97,7519.245,7531.724,We look forward to hearing more from you as you craft the final legislation and then we can have a fully big suite of proposals in front of us for consideration.,164,,
969,0.97,7531.724,7533.759,Is there any additional comments or questions?,164,,
970,0.97,7533.759,7542.334,"Councilmember Nelson . again, I just want to reiterate that this is the initial briefing, high-level concepts.",164,,
971,0.97,7542.334,7553.078,The actual content of legislation or legislative suite of items is still being finalized it sounds like.,164,,
972,0.97,7553.078,7562.288,I wanted to make sure that folks know that we are not with the final legislation in front of us but happy to take high- level questions and comments.,164,,
973,0.97,7562.288,7564.857,"Please go ahead, Councilmember Nelson.",164,,
974,0.97,7564.857,7567.593,Thank you very much.,165,,
975,0.97,7567.593,7568.928,I look forward to learning more.,165,,
976,0.97,7568.928,7571.897,I'm all about not reinventing the wheel.,165,,
977,0.97,7571.897,7588.28,It seems as if it is building on work already done by the collaboration of the various departments and Stakeholders.,165,,
978,0.97,7588.28,7588.847,That is great.,165,,
979,0.97,7588.847,7594.987,I hope this takes into account the information provided in the 2019 Cannabis equity survey and analysis.,165,,
980,0.97,7594.987,7608.5,"All of that said and also appreciate that the Mayor's office has been reaching out to the existing community, and the retailers themselves.",165,,
981,0.97,7608.5,7635.16,"So one question that maybe you will be able to answer it now is do you anticipate a Reprogramming of the city allocation of the state excise tax dollars and in the Parenthetical NOTE the highest in the nation at 37%, but will those dollars be used to support any of this work?",165,,
982,0.97,7635.16,7644.603,"Thank you for that question, Councilmember.",166,,
983,0.97,7644.603,7647.94,At this time is not our intention to Repurpose those dollars for this suite of legislation.,166,,
984,0.97,7647.94,7649.942,This is a first step toward a larger body of work.,166,,
985,0.97,7649.942,7657.683,"While I appreciate that there have been recommendations from our many Stakeholders to Repurpose those dollars, that is not our current intention.",166,,
986,0.97,7657.683,7658.65,Okay.,167,,
987,0.97,7658.65,7661.353,Thank you.,167,,
988,0.97,7661.353,7673.265,"The Cannabis industry already highly regulated and taxed and subject to many barriers like no access to capital, no normal banking and no tax deduction for Federal income.",167,,
989,0.97,7673.265,7677.136,It is vulnerable to competition from the illicit marketplace.,167,,
990,0.97,7677.136,7693.986,I just hope that the forthcoming regulations will be well thought out so as not to cause any major difficulties to our small businesses operating in this space.,167,,
991,0.97,7693.986,7696.989,So thank you very much and I look forward to this.,167,,
992,0.97,7696.989,7703.862,"When you said and were talking about ancillary businesses, I look forward to that.",167,,
993,0.97,7703.862,7706.932,I note that has been called for.,167,,
994,0.97,7706.932,7718.243,Are there any anticipated changes to the regulations around Buffers that could actually increase the number of licenses available for equity ownership?,167,,
995,0.97,7718.243,7720.512,That would be a separate conversation Councilmember Nelson.,168,,
996,0.97,7720.512,7732.191,Right now the legislation is an acknowledgment that the state could be issuing additional types of Cannabis licenses.,168,,
997,0.97,7732.191,7755.347,It expands the the code section to effectively anticipate that we would consider issuing such licenses for people doing business within the city if the state makes such a decision.,168,,
998,0.97,7755.347,7762.454,"But it does not get specific about which types of new businesses, where they would be located, or any other details at this stage.",168,,
999,0.97,7762.454,7764.289,Thanks.,169,,
1000,0.97,7764.289,7774.266,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",170,,

1008,0.97,7796.989,7805.33,"The concept here would be to get additional feedback, as noted by Breonna.",170,,
1009,0.97,7805.33,7816.408,If there is legislation transmitted down it would appear on introduction of the full calendar in the first week of August.,170,,
1010,0.97,7816.408,7819.745,"Colleagues, we would then have opportunity look at legislation and consider any possible issues for identification.",170,,

1015,0.97,7849.942,7863.388,"That is given the Slowdowns in the fundraising that they have experience, colleagues, we have additional information from central staff with a clear sideboard requested to make sure people understand why this project is unique.",170,,
