26,0.97,69.035,81.881,"President's report, I do not have anything to report today, so we'll go ahead and jump on in to the presentation on the Co-Law enforcement assisted diversion L.E.A.D.",18,,
27,0.97,81.881,82.115,Program.,18,,
28,0.97,82.115,97.063,"We have with us today a few Presenters, Lisa Daugaard, the presenter with the public defender's Association, we have Jesse Benet, Melodie Reece and Leontai Berry.",18,,
29,0.97,97.063,102.802,"Councilmember Lewis, do you want to make remarks on this subject before I hand it over?",18,,
30,0.97,102.802,125.758,"Yes, thank you, Madam President, just very briefly, so over the last couple of weeks, I have had the privilege of working with Lisa Daugaard and other folks at the public defender Association, the talk about Co-Lead and the possibility of bringing Co-Lead to the city of Seattle and the services they're providing.",19,,
31,0.97,125.758,186.619,"I'll leave it obviously to them and their presentation to explain what Co-Lead is, but, you know, as we are working through a lot of our challenges of having, still having a lot of our neighbors living outside during the Covid-19 crisis and seeing that we need a lot of different tools in our tool box to provide out reach in the changing and evolving environment, some of the success that I have seen from talking to people at King County and talking to people in other jurisdictions that Co-Lead has been able to do in Burien and other parts of King County and providing out reach and getting people inside and getting people access to wrap around services has been really instrumental to making sure that there is a lot of different tools and services for people to live with dignity during this crisis.",19,,
32,0.97,186.619,192.759,I know Councilmembers Herbold and Strauss has been working with them for the last couple of weeks.,19,,
33,0.97,192.759,206.606,I got the idea to try to arrange a presentation during the briefing when I held the Bia directors put together a similar presentation last week which was great and I was glad to have been a part of that as well.,19,,
34,0.97,206.606,227.56,"I'm looking forward to seeing it again and hearing from our team here that we have from the PDA and looking at ways we could partner as a city and take advantage of some of the services with that, I want to turn it over to the presenting panel and hear what folks have to say.",19,,
35,0.97,227.56,249.649,"Great, thank you Councilmember Lewis, for inviting these guests to join us today to talk about this really important issue, particularly in the context of addressing the challenges associated with the Covid-19 public health crisis and addressing the needs of those experiencing homelessness.",20,,
36,0.97,249.649,261.561,"I appreciate your attention to this matter as chair of the Committee on the homelessness services and intervention programs and without further Ado, we'll head over to our Panelist.",20,,
37,0.97,261.561,262.395,It is 9:35 A.M ..,20,,
38,0.97,262.395,267.9,We're scheduled to hear this presentation until 10:05:00 A.M.,20,,
39,0.97,267.9,271.437,So we'll be afford ad the full time for this presentation.,20,,
40,0.97,271.437,275.508,I'll go ahead and hand it over to the Presenters at this point.,20,,
41,0.97,275.508,279.646,I'll go ahead and share my screen and I'll handle the slides.,21,,
42,0.97,279.646,284.984,I think Lisa will kick us off.,21,,
43,0.97,284.984,291.557,Here we go.,21,,
44,0.97,291.557,296.663,Can everybody see that okay?,21,,
45,0.97,296.663,297.063,Looks great.,22,,
46,0.97,297.063,297.297,Okay.,23,,
47,0.97,297.297,298.831,Good morning to the Council.,24,,
48,0.97,298.831,302.935,Thanks so much for having us.,24,,
49,0.97,302.935,311.444,"Thanks, Councilmember Lewis for proposing this and Council President Gonzalez for finding a way to hear from us this morning.",24,,
50,0.97,311.444,345.611,"I am just am going to give an over view of what we're doing and why and then Jesse and Melodie and Leontai, doing the work on the ground basis will explain the practice of Co-Lead and what we're seeing already that is promising, so you may recall that we had a delay in finalizing the contract for the standard program, classic L.E.A.D., if you will.",24,,
51,0.97,345.611,364.263,"We did reach an agreement on that contract in early to Mid-March, just in time to find that the entire world had shifted around us, so it has been really important to recall what is the core purpose and solution of L.E.A.D.",24,,
52,0.97,364.263,375.608,And how can we adapt the resources quickly and in a targeted way to still deliver on the function that L.E.A.D.,24,,
53,0.97,375.608,388.354,Is meant to serve under Covid emergency conditions and given the profound changes that have occurred with respect to the entire criminal legal system and law enforcement.,24,,
54,0.97,388.354,391.491,The purpose of L.E.A.D.,24,,
55,0.97,391.491,428.694,"Is to address law violations and problematic behavior that stem from, that are genuine issues and that do present a legitimate expectation from the community of a response where an enforcement response would be legally authorized but where we know that jail and prosecution are generally both ineffective and often counter productive in actually revolving the problems that drive the Problemed behavior in the first place.",24,,
56,0.97,428.694,434.167,"In the current landscape, we have seen, in classic L.E.A.D.",24,,
57,0.97,434.167,461.494,"We do arrest diversion, people who could be subject to arrest and jail booking are instead connected in a warm hand off to community based care providers who start on a sustained process of case management and support that may last months or years, and then we also take social contact referrals so it is not necessary to make an arrest in order to get people help and support.",24,,
58,0.97,461.494,492.225,"These days, law enforcement has been dramatically affected by Covid conditions because it is not safe to Proactively engage people unless it is necessary and the resources, including jail booking are functionally inaccessible for lower level, not to say unimportant, but lower level public ordered type offenses.",24,,
59,0.97,492.225,502.802,"There are jail booking criteria, region wide, including at the King County jail where the Seattle police Department would book people.",24,,
60,0.97,502.802,505.605,The courts are closed.,24,,
61,0.97,505.605,528.995,"If at all possible, an alternate response to genuine issues around law violations due to behavioral health conditions and extreme poverty, so people living in shelters, people using drugs, engaged in the informal economy that has never been more important.",24,,
62,0.97,528.995,543.643,"In some ways, if we don't mobilize that, there is no other obvious response, so that is what we attempted to do with Co-L.E.A.D., which the Co stands for Covid and Co-Responder.",24,,
63,0.97,543.643,569.835,"We attempted it to figure out a way to use the same vaults and principles of classic L.E.A.D., so housing first, harm reduction, Field-Based engagement, intensive care, and what we know works for people struggling with Trama and related behavioral health issues, but at different points of Interception.",24,,
64,0.97,569.835,595.895,"It is important and we won't focus on it very much in this presentation is to support the people who both were in jail and needed to get out in order for the King County jail population to be reduced for Covid transmission reasons and because in general, that is a good objective, people were needing to be released but courts needed to see a plan.",24,,
65,0.97,595.895,600.032,We have been asked to help with that and we have been.,24,,
66,0.97,600.032,618.718,"There were people that were released but because of the barren landscape with no legal income sources available to many people, normal systems of care that are usually pretty inaccessible to this population, even less accessible.",24,,
67,0.97,618.718,620.553,We'll talk more about that.,24,,
68,0.97,620.553,638.671,"People were released, but really were struggling, violating conditions of release, but needed not to go back into the jail, so we're also responding to those situations, and this is just to keep--related to Incarceration.",24,,
69,0.97,638.671,647.546,"Nationally there is a lot of discussion about that, locally, we're really putting together a Community-Based care plan that makes that viable.",24,,
70,0.97,647.546,662.928,"The other thing, though, that I just want to name, as you all know from the last ten years, hearing occasionally from me, it is a bad idea to make the best level of care accessible to people only through the contact with the criminal legal system.",24,,
71,0.97,662.928,690.322,"You don't want to set it up so people get the highest level of support, only after they get charged with a crime, so we were glad to see in Burien, and we're just talking about Burien because that is where we started this first so it is a good example of what is possible, we were glad to see in Burien law enforcement and community leaders and city officials all say, look, there are jail booking limits.",24,,
72,0.97,690.322,711.177,"We know we shouldn't be engaging in just moving people around, and at the same time, folks were starting to gather and live in the parks in Burien, which have kind of been the no camping areas designated by Burien city officials.",24,,
73,0.97,711.177,716.716,"Rather than just moving people along, can you step in and provide alternate support?",24,,
74,0.97,716.716,762.428,"So the picture that you see here Co-L.E.A.D., born in Burien, several weeks back in the parking lot by Burien District Court before the team went out and did initial out reach in the Burien state park and Dottie Harper Park, identifying people, many of whom who were using drugs and had nowhere else to stay, but who needed help, some of whom were or thought they may be sick with Covid-Like symptoms, many didn't have access to sanitation facilities to prevent that, and all of whom were absolutely, you know, in a precarious position with no access to meaningful income.",24,,
75,0.97,762.428,773.005,This is the kind of Place-Based out reach and case management that we have begun to deploy.,24,,
76,0.97,773.005,775.808,"We're thinking in the next several months, Co-L.E.A.D.",24,,
77,0.97,775.808,814.747,"Is scheduled to work now through July, that we would be able to Replicate this work in several locations in Seattle where there are serious public order issues but the kind of issues that respond best to care, support, intensive case management and a lodging situation, so we're trying to apply housing first in a context where suddenly there is this new resource of hotel rooms that, you know, the hotel industry has been profoundly affected by the economic shut down.",24,,
78,0.97,814.747,850.249,"Will probably not see a return to normal for many, many months, if not longer than that, and hotels provide an important platform to more than shelter people, to give people a good place to find--to security and a base of engagement for care teams that are going to be working with folks over the next couple of months and where we have already seen, really quite bigger--I don't want to minimize.",24,,
79,0.97,850.249,863.662,"This is not easy work and people have challenges, but this context of hotel rooms has allowed the care teams to very effectively engage with people in many cases.",24,,
80,0.97,863.662,875.207,"I'll turn it over to Jesse, Leontai, and Melodie.",24,,
81,0.97,875.207,880.546,We're pretty tight on time so I think--do we have another five or so minutes?,25,,
82,0.97,880.546,882.381,I know we only had ten total.,25,,
83,0.97,882.381,886.285,We are scheduled to go until 10:05.,26,,
84,0.97,886.285,886.619,"Oh, great.",27,,
85,0.97,886.619,891.156,So you have a few more minutes here.,28,,
86,0.97,891.156,891.49,Wonderful.,29,,
87,0.97,891.49,892.524,Thank you so much.,29,,
88,0.97,892.524,900.132,"So Lisa covered a little bit around the hotels, so I'll just talk a little bit about the model.",29,,
89,0.97,900.132,918.117,"So the model is based on more of a shift work and less sort of 9:00 to 5:00 hours, so the initial team of what we call out reach Responders/Case managers that were hired up, there were 12, we're up to 15 of them now.",29,,
90,0.97,918.117,919.518,The shifts are 8:00 to 4:30 P.M.,29,,
91,0.97,919.518,924.023,Monday through Friday as well as 1:00 P.M.,29,,
92,0.97,924.023,924.823,To 9:30 P.M ..,29,,
93,0.97,924.823,929.128,"Saturday and Sunday, 10:00 to 4:30 with somebody on call overnight.",29,,
94,0.97,929.128,931.096,These hours are sort of the most important thing.,29,,
95,0.97,931.096,939.371,One of the most important things of the program because this allows for us to meet at our office where we have supplies.,29,,
96,0.97,939.371,950.249,It allows staff to kind of look at E-mail and get caught up for the day and it allows us to go out to the hotels and have actually an on site presence in each of the hotels.,29,,
97,0.97,950.249,961.727,"We have a staff room at three of the five hotels that we use, the larger hotels, and we're actually on site during the day shift and the swing shift and the weekend shift.",29,,
98,0.97,961.727,969.868,"We're checking in with program participants, we're there in the staff room, we're kind of coming and going, we're talking with hotel staff.",29,,
99,0.97,969.868,976.709,We're there for a chunk of each of those shifts.,29,,
100,0.97,976.709,982.381,That slide and this slide just talk a little bit more about what Lisa was talking about.,29,,
101,0.97,982.381,986.018,Our focus around helping people shelter in place.,29,,
102,0.97,986.018,1006.505,"The initial kind of stabilization, and then we go into more of an intensive case management mode where whatever the social services system, whatever sort of place it is operating at, we're there to access it, so initially we had heard food stamps weren't up and running and then they were.",29,,
103,0.97,1006.505,1013.812,We're making sure people are getting on Dshs.,29,,
104,0.97,1013.812,1019.818,We're making sure people are on apple health and Medicaid is turned on.,29,,
105,0.97,1019.818,1035.501,We have a medical provider that goes out four of the five days a week and she spends two to four hours on shift with the out reach responders going and seeing clients and offering Healthcare support and behavioral health support.,29,,
106,0.97,1035.501,1048.747,"Many of our clients, a small Subset are enrolled in the broader community behavioral health treatment system but that system has very much gone quite minimal during a time of Covid.",29,,
107,0.97,1048.747,1052.684,Many providers are offering limited Cristhianic based service and Telehealth.,29,,
108,0.97,1052.684,1055.921,That is not an option that works for many of the program participants.,29,,
109,0.97,1055.921,1060.893,"They need the services to come to them, so that has been a huge help.",29,,
110,0.97,1060.893,1076.341,"On day two, in the program, she was able to work very hard and Collaboratively with neighbor care to get several folks on Suboxone within a couple of days of the program.",29,,
111,0.97,1076.341,1077.576,Melodie will talk about that.,29,,
112,0.97,1077.576,1079.878,Lisa already covered how Co-L.E.A.D.,29,,
113,0.97,1079.878,1092.357,"Is based on L.E.A.D., and then the next couple of slides, I'm going to turn over to Melodie and Leontai to talk about a participants.",29,,
114,0.97,1092.357,1094.259,He agreed to have his photo used.,29,,
115,0.97,1094.259,1098.33,"This is at one of the hotels, the next couple of slides.",29,,
116,0.97,1098.33,1110.876,I'll have them talk a little bit about a day in the life of an out reach Responder and what it is like to provide services on site at the hotels and other thoughts that they have to add.,29,,
117,0.97,1110.876,1117.149,Do you want to take it from here?,29,,
118,0.97,1117.149,1117.382,Yeah.,30,,
119,0.97,1117.382,1117.716,"Thanks, Jesse.",30,,
120,0.97,1117.716,1120.452,Hello city council.,30,,
121,0.97,1120.452,1124.323,Good to see you this morning.,30,,
122,0.97,1124.323,1138.504,"A day in the life of us as outreach responders looks pretty much, you know, it is a good balance of Street out reach and motel out reach.",30,,
123,0.97,1138.504,1152.484,"It is a lot of being on site as Jesse said, to have a presence, to set up in the lobby of whatever hotel room, to just allow folks to see that we're there if they have troubles or want to chat.",30,,
124,0.97,1152.484,1175.14,"We also do check in with all of our participants at each of the hotels daily either by call or actually by knocking on their doors, making sure that they, you know, are Privy to medical appointments that they have or court hearings or things like that.",30,,
125,0.97,1175.14,1184.516,"You know it is a lot of just, like, being there for people and helping them through this time.",30,,
126,0.97,1184.516,1190.522,"This client here that you see in the slide, his name is Ricky.",30,,
127,0.97,1190.522,1206.405,He is a student at Highline college and had actually been living in a Laundrymat for the last four months in Auburn.,30,,
128,0.97,1206.405,1208.473,We got him in contact with police.,30,,
129,0.97,1208.473,1209.775,He was going to be trespassed.,30,,
130,0.97,1209.775,1233.065,"We got him into housing or into the temporary housing that we secure at Seatac and here is the next picture, again, Ricky and some of the outreach responders and another client, sort of going through goal setting and talking through, you know, challenges that they're having.",30,,
131,0.97,1233.065,1243.342,Ricky is an awesome success story because he has been continuing to go to school through this.,30,,
132,0.97,1243.342,1279.911,"We have hooked him up with several different services and we continue to just be a support system for him and he, being able to take a shower and be Hygenic has really helped with his over demeanor and we're seeing that from clients that they're so grateful to just be able to have a place to shower, to take a bath where they haven't in a long time because many of the sanitation and other, sort of, facilities have been closed down.",30,,
133,0.97,1279.911,1287.519,So being able to just have a hot shower and to have a bed is really stabilizing for a lot of people.,30,,
134,0.97,1287.519,1347.846,"I do also want to point out that, like, the ability for us to stabilize these folks using this temporary hotel room situation, approximately half of our client load have personally opted into Medicated assisted treatment which is essentially a way for folks to help WEAN off of the drug of choice and sort of get back on their feet in terms of health, so for that many people to be able to say I'm ready to stop my addiction and asked for medical help is profound and would not have happened would we not get them a place to sleep, so I'll leave it at that and let Leontai speak a little more.",30,,
135,0.97,1347.846,1348.146,Thank you.,30,,
136,0.97,1348.146,1349.981,"Hello, city council.",31,,
137,0.97,1349.981,1351.049,My name is Leontai.,31,,
138,0.97,1351.049,1368.9,"A day in the life with Co-L.E.A.D., I'm going to have to say from the very first day, when we started, we out reached with individuals and they were kind of Iffy whether they wanted to be screened by us or not.",31,,
139,0.97,1368.9,1396.094,"Once we showed them that we're invested and we cared and continued to come by, come by, come by, the next week after that, the next week after that, many individuals were showing up, showing up, showing up, asking us, asking us, asking us, and there is this one individual who we currently have placed that I met.",31,,
140,0.97,1396.094,1402.734,"When I engaged with him, he was pretty--he is a pretty self sufficient person.",31,,
141,0.97,1402.734,1406.772,He didn't really care what I was talking about.,31,,
142,0.97,1406.772,1415.213,"He was willing to screen, but from my perspective, I feel like he didn't believe what I was telling him, so he came off as a Grumpy kind of guy.",31,,
143,0.97,1415.213,1417.516,Everyone knows him as a Grumpy kind of guy.,31,,
144,0.97,1417.516,1425.123,"Since he has been placed, he calls me every night, texts me in the morning, he has made food for me.",31,,
145,0.97,1425.123,1437.636,I think the big thing with this group of individuals on our staff team is what we bring to the table is compassion and hard work and showing these people we actually care and are here for them.,31,,
146,0.97,1437.636,1443.341,"As more of a friend approach, not as an authoritative figure.",31,,
147,0.97,1443.341,1453.685,We want them to make the organic change on their own and we're here to support them if they want to do that.,31,,
148,0.97,1453.685,1455.32,We're not forcing them into doing anything.,31,,
149,0.97,1455.32,1463.895,"We're making sure they have the resources that they can get, that we have to offer.",31,,
150,0.97,1463.895,1464.83,"Thank you, Leontai.",32,,
151,0.97,1464.83,1515.413,"So one thing I skipped over is before we did our first parking lot, kind of, meeting with Burien law enforcement, we did about a week's worth of pretty intensive harm reduction, Motivational interviewing, out Reach-Based case management and introduction to mental health training and I think because of that and just this beautifully diverse group of staff that we hired, we had already really created a strong kind of Cohort to put arms around the clients that we are supporting and everything is based on, you know, Harm-Reduction, we honor everyone's agency and determination and treat them with respect and dignity and kindness.",32,,
152,0.97,1515.413,1516.481,I mentioned the lodging agreement.,32,,
153,0.97,1516.481,1518.55,There are also rules to follow.,32,,
154,0.97,1518.55,1522.254,This is not a free for all or party time.,32,,
155,0.97,1522.254,1537.135,"The lodging agreement is a solid three pages and there are a lot of things, especially given Covid that we're asking clients to do, including wear Ppe, not have visitors to their room, et cetera.",32,,
156,0.97,1537.135,1545.744,"The next slide, Lisa really covered a lot of this, sorry if you can hear that.",32,,
157,0.97,1545.744,1548.079,My neighbor is sawing in his Bckyard.,32,,
158,0.97,1548.079,1550.215,The target population is two fold.,32,,
159,0.97,1550.215,1561.86,We're responding to folks that are stuck in jail and then also a neighborhood level approach in tandem with the law enforcement partners.,32,,
160,0.97,1561.86,1566.197,The next two slides are about budget and we have another slide over what we're tracking and measurement.,32,,
161,0.97,1566.197,1572.037,I think I'll go to that one first and let Lisa do budget.,32,,
162,0.97,1572.037,1578.877,We are tracking everything that we would be tracking for classic L.E.A.D.,32,,
163,0.97,1578.877,1584.215,For both the city's Hsd requirements and the counties be heard.,32,,
164,0.97,1584.215,1591.656,Right now implementing a case management system that is sophisticated than our spread sheet tracking that we're doing.,32,,
165,0.97,1591.656,1599.097,"We're tracking all of the Democratic information, homelessness information, and criminal legal system involvement information.",32,,
166,0.97,1599.097,1612.21,"We have--it is a bit unique to set up a case management program within the ranks of PDA, which is essentially kind of a law firm that does criminal legal system reform and has several program areas.",32,,
167,0.97,1612.21,1637.569,We have had to be quite creative in terms of how we get behavioral health information and we have adapted a couple of different releases of information and have done a lot of coordination with local systems to make sure that we're informed from behavioral health industry and the medical provider can look folks up and see their Medicaid and some of their other Healthcare history.,32,,
168,0.97,1637.569,1649.114,I'll let Lisa talk a little bit about Dr. Catherine Beck yet from U-Dub who has been working with us on the classic L.E.A.D.,32,,
169,0.97,1649.114,1659.824,"And not only oversee but track along and witness, if you will, what we're doing in Co-L.E.A.D ..",32,,
170,0.97,1659.824,1667.565,"One of the cool things is every day, Monday through Friday, we have a shift change where the day and the swing meet for an hour and we staff all of the clients.",32,,
171,0.97,1667.565,1676.274,"This is based on a daily team meeting model that comes out of assertive community treatment, an intensive mental health model.",32,,
172,0.97,1676.274,1685.517,"That meeting has just created a sense of, like, community around our clients, a sense of knowledge and understanding in terms of how other people are supporting people.",32,,
173,0.97,1685.517,1690.288,"It allows us to call each other in, if you will, around advocating for clients and what they need.",32,,
174,0.97,1690.288,1695.093,It also allows us to talk about boundaries and set rules and limits.,32,,
175,0.97,1695.093,1704.269,It has been a pretty lovely way to watch the team come together and really put heads down and think about how do we support people from a harm reduction stance.,32,,
176,0.97,1704.269,1708.64,Where do I use--how can I use Motivational interviewing?,32,,
177,0.97,1708.64,1711.142,What is a resource to connect this person to?,32,,
178,0.97,1711.142,1721.853,I'll go to the budget slide and hand it back over to Lisa and then it sounds like we should have a couple minutes for questions.,32,,
179,0.97,1721.853,1729.327,I'll wrap it up here so that there is time for questions.,33,,
180,0.97,1729.327,1732.597,The budget is laid out here through July.,33,,
181,0.97,1732.597,1734.833,This is just Repurposing existing funding for L.E.A.D.,33,,
182,0.97,1734.833,1744.342,That can be used differently to reach the same population.,33,,
183,0.97,1744.342,1748.079,We were planning to on it.,33,,
184,0.97,1748.079,1750.248,This is the second L.E.A.D.,33,,
185,0.97,1750.248,1751.883,Team.,33,,
186,0.97,1751.883,1758.623,"There are additional costs due to Covid conditions, Ppe, medical devices and so on.",33,,
187,0.97,1758.623,1768.6,"The hotel cost is $300,000 for the Seattle focus and offset by a really nice donation from Pearl jam.",33,,
188,0.97,1768.6,1784.215,"Figuring out how to take this forward, if that is desired, after July or August, is a coming conversation.",33,,
189,0.97,1784.215,1795.226,There is a robust evaluation process under way and we hope to have kind of lessons learned and implications of the work available to city officials in the next six to eight weeks.,33,,
190,0.97,1795.226,1811.643,"Where we might be able to work, we obviously don't have the resources or capacity to work everywhere where this might be a suitable approach, but what we can do is demonstrate that it is possible and what it takes to have this go well.",33,,
191,0.97,1811.643,1829.227,"We're looking to do that in some places of great community impact and great need and have heard the suggestion of Pioneer square, second Avenue extension and the area by the navigation center at 12th and King, certain open to work in those areas.",33,,
192,0.97,1829.227,1857.222,"I'm glad to say that the Mayor's office is in dialogue with this about where we can be most effective, a partnership that we will be activating this week, trying to reach agreement on where we can best make use of these resources to generate the lessons that can be derived from this style of work.",33,,
193,0.97,1857.222,1858.89,.,33,,
194,0.97,1858.89,1867.332,I stopped sharing the slide show so I can see everybody if there are questions.,34,,
195,0.97,1867.332,1873.738,Thank you so much for that presentation.,35,,
196,0.97,1873.738,1875.874,Really appreciate it.,35,,
197,0.97,1875.874,1887.352,"We have three minutes left allotted in this slot and I saw Councilmember Morales has indicated she has a question, so I'll hand it over to her to ask her.",35,,
198,0.97,1887.352,1894.025,"Colleagues, I'm going to allow maybe two more questions after this.",35,,
199,0.97,1894.025,1897.362,Now is the time to raise your hand.,35,,
200,0.97,1897.362,1899.797,I see Councilmember Strauss.,35,,
201,0.97,1899.797,1900.965,Anybody else with a question?,35,,
202,0.97,1900.965,1902.0,Okay.,35,,
203,0.97,1902.0,1905.903,"Councilmember Morales, the floor is yours.",35,,
204,0.97,1905.903,1906.371,Thank you.,36,,
205,0.97,1906.371,1909.44,Thank you to the team presenting today.,36,,
206,0.97,1909.44,1918.249,This seems a humane way to respond to issues we got facing our neighborhoods in the city.,36,,
207,0.97,1918.249,1927.125,I want to thank you for offering this demonstration of how we could be responding to the challenges we have in the community.,36,,
208,0.97,1927.125,1935.6,I can tell you that folks in the Chinatown International district are particularly interested in ideas like this.,36,,
209,0.97,1935.6,1947.679,"We have been talking about them about whether we can find some hotel space to move people and I know several Council members are working on the same idea, so this doesn't look easy.",36,,
210,0.97,1947.679,1951.983,"These sorts of intense case management, obviously requires a lot of planning and logistics.",36,,
211,0.97,1951.983,1987.051,"I want to thank you for the work you're doing and I want to ask if you're able to do this in the next six to eight weeks, if you would be able to come back and do a check in with us so we can learn what worked, what didn't work, and really how we can you know, try to double down on this kind of strategy so that we're protecting our neighbors as much as possible.",36,,
212,0.97,1987.051,1991.956,Absolutely.,37,,
213,0.97,1991.956,1992.223,Great.,38,,
214,0.97,1992.223,1995.026,Awe succinct answer.,38,,
215,0.97,1995.026,1998.796,"Thank you, Lisa, thank you everyone else working on this.",39,,
216,0.97,1998.796,2010.708,"I am hoping to know, I think I already know the answer, but would like to ask here, when were the Seattle based hotel rooms booked?",39,,
217,0.97,2010.708,2020.785,When were your case managers in Seattle brought on and could you have been shoes on the ground the week of March 27th or March 20th?,39,,
218,0.97,2020.785,2021.019,Sure.,40,,
219,0.97,2021.019,2022.12,I'll take that.,40,,
220,0.97,2022.12,2034.932,"We reserved a block of hotel rooms in early April, understanding that we could add more and we are about to add more.",40,,
221,0.97,2034.932,2049.113,"We have this case management team up and ready to work in an area that presented, you know, public order issues, a lot of need and community impact.",40,,
222,0.97,2049.113,2076.808,"Neighborhood impact, so, yes, we could have done work in Ballard, at Ballard Commons, and at the same time, it is clearly true that you know, we can't respond in all possible appropriate places, so we are ready to go in one or more of the high impact locales that combine major community impact, neighborhood impact and human need.",40,,
223,0.97,2076.808,2082.847,I wanted to add one thing I forgot earlier and it is so important and I should have it in the slide.,41,,
224,0.97,2082.847,2096.094,"Part of what has made this work so well is we have two people, one is one of our lead project managers that serve as hotel liaisons.",41,,
225,0.97,2096.094,2100.097,This is the practice borrowed from permanent supportive housing.,41,,
226,0.97,2100.097,2114.245,"You don't have the program liaison with the housing provider, you have an in between person that understands property management, often comes from real estate background and so we used one of our L.E.A.D.",41,,
227,0.97,2114.245,2115.413,Project managers and our Co-L.E.A.D.,41,,
228,0.97,2115.413,2119.851,Operations manager that helps with that and they do the liaisons with the hotels.,41,,
229,0.97,2119.851,2127.058,"When the hotel has an issue, they call Jesse or Tabitha here.",41,,
230,0.97,2127.058,2131.729,"The concern, validate it and send it over to us and communicate back.",41,,
231,0.97,2131.729,2144.242,"That has been the magic, the responsiveness, and this is not anything--it is not anything new.",41,,
232,0.97,2144.242,2145.51,Many housing Priors do this.,41,,
233,0.97,2145.51,2149.046,"It is like a landlord liaison, if you will.",41,,
234,0.97,2149.046,2155.987,That has been critical and we have had 24/7 response to the hotels if they have an issue.,41,,
235,0.97,2155.987,2168.799,"It allowed us to educate them around harm reduction practices, allowed for us to collaborate and it has been a really lovely partnership that we have had with the hotels in supporting our clients.",41,,
236,0.97,2168.799,2174.872,One of the hotels gives the clients all a welcome kit when they arrive.,41,,
237,0.97,2174.872,2177.308,It is pretty stunning to watch.,41,,
238,0.97,2177.308,2184.048,I think Lisa actually started negotiating some of the hotel stuff even back in March.,41,,
239,0.97,2184.048,2186.417,This was no easy feat.,41,,
240,0.97,2186.417,2198.629,She was working around the clock trying to get these hotel relationships up and we're just so lucky that we got in early and were able to navigate some of that.,41,,
241,0.97,2198.629,2202.133,"And thank you, Jesse and Lisa.",42,,
242,0.97,2202.133,2208.039,"During the time of Covid, I have changed my understanding of time and I said March and I meant April.",42,,
243,0.97,2208.039,2211.976,Thank you for answering the correct month name.,42,,
244,0.97,2211.976,2213.444,Thank you all.,42,,
245,0.97,2213.444,2218.215,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, so we're running a little over at this point.",43,,
246,0.97,2218.215,2230.595,"I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Herbold, who has a quick set of remarks to make and we'll thank our Presenters who are available to us Offline.",43,,
247,0.97,2230.595,2237.368,"Gladly available to us Offline to continue this important conversation, so Councilmember remember bold, the floor is yours.",43,,

249,0.97,2237.768,2247.678,I just want to really extend my appreciation to the folks at L.E.A.D.,44,,
250,0.97,2247.678,2261.292,"And specifically Lisa, Jesse, Leontai and me will--Melodie for the good work.",44,,
251,0.97,2261.292,2266.697,Thank you for reorienting the work for addressing the needs associated with the Covid-19 crisis.,44,,
252,0.97,2266.697,2273.271,"And I also want to just say that I'm really excited, the comments may have been made by Councilmember Lewis at the beginning.",44,,
253,0.97,2273.271,2291.722,"I came in a little bit late, but I'm really excited that the Mayor's office is working in collaboration with you to do this shift and do the contract negotiations necessary to put it in place.",44,,
254,0.97,2291.722,2299.997,I got an E-mail last week where the executive States that they positively view Co-L.E.A.D.,44,,
255,0.97,2299.997,2333.631,"As a potentially useful tool for helping the public safety and public health goals and they go on to say that they were really excited about what could be learned from this new public safety program and hope some lessons can be learned from ongoing impact to improve community safety and better serve higher barrier individuals, so really, in awe of the work you're doing on the street and appreciative of your collaboration with Hsd and the Mayor's office and we'll be with you to bring this forward.",44,,
256,0.97,2333.631,2333.964,Thank you.,45,,
257,0.97,2333.964,2363.394,"We are really grateful and appreciative for that and as we close out, I want to acknowledge the wonderful partnership that has been developed rapidly with not only the city attorney's office but also with Seattle municipal court, that is leaning heavily on this as a strategy for De-Carceration and incredibly healthy local conversations and Ecosystem, so we appreciate it and you all.",45,,
258,0.97,2363.394,2368.499,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold, and thank you especially to all of our Presenters.",46,,
259,0.97,2368.499,2377.108,Not just for being with us today but for the hard work that you're doing every day to serve folks in the community.,46,,

281,0.97,2502.199,2522.553,"As we heard from the presentation just now, we do have other options when it comes to working with people who are still living outside and those options include ways to bring them into safe, secure places to meet their needs rather than push them around the communities.",47,,
282,0.97,2522.553,2526.357,"In Ballard, we have made great progress on market Street construction.",47,,
283,0.97,2526.357,2548.579,"This is a very delayed project and as soon as I came into office, I worked with S-Dot to make sure that we were meeting and exceeding the Timelines and I'm thankful to S-Dot for delivering the section of the project ahead of schedule.",47,,

299,0.97,2678.275,2684.214,The meeting of May 12th is cancelled due to the governor's order.,49,,
300,0.97,2684.214,2700.064,The main thing I want to share with Council today relates to the fact that on Thursday the city attorney filed the motion to terminate the consent decree two year Sustainment plan.,49,,
301,0.97,2700.064,2712.142,There is an important exception to what was filed on Thursday as compared to what earlier deliberations had considered filing.,49,,
302,0.97,2712.142,2730.227,"That exception is because of what the city attorney heard from the Council, it does not include the concerns raised by Judge Robard in his may 21st, 2019, order about accountability.",49,,
303,0.97,2730.227,2744.074,The motion States that the city will file a subsequent motion by August 1ST and the city's Rereply at that time will address the issues raised regarding discipline.,49,,
304,0.97,2744.074,2796.593,"We had earlier conversations around concern that the filing would include a request to terminate the consent decree as it relates to the police accountability issues and really pleased that the executive and the city attorney agreed to hold those issues until a subsequent filing out of the shared concern with the Council that we needed to do more work engaging with our community stake holders around those issues, specific to issues that were raised by the Council and resolution accompanying the passage of the contract.",49,,
305,0.97,2796.593,2804.334,"Those were issues not only identified by the Council but identified by community stake holders, including the CPC.",49,,
306,0.97,2804.334,2827.257,"It is really important to honor the fact that this process was begun by community groups nearly ten years ago, sent a letter to the Department of justice in response to their letter, the Department of justice released findings on 2011 and the city and the DOJ entered into a consent decree back in 2012.",49,,
307,0.97,2827.257,2852.082,"The gains in lowering use of force and enhancing accountability also came about because of the actions of the Department, in particular, police officers who worked with all of the other branches of the reform effort to implement reform.",49,,
308,0.97,2852.082,2876.106,"The filing of the motion to terminate the consent decree two year Sustainment program is an exercise in demonstrating that all of the phase one assessments, together with the 13 compliance reports completed during phase two have been completed.",49,,
309,0.97,2876.106,2897.861,"The city has gone through an exercise of submitting reports and having the court, having the monitor conclude the reports Significanceny compliance.",49,,
310,0.97,2897.861,2914.645,"The assessment and the compliance reports compromised more than 1,000 pages and the monitor has agreed in each of those instances that SPD has achieve and and sustained compliance over the last two years.",49,,
311,0.97,2914.645,2923.186,Those issues cover the incidents of serious force and the reduction of the use of serious force and.,49,,
312,0.97,2923.186,2927.457,Serious force has been reduced by 60%.,49,,
313,0.97,2927.457,2956.753,"We, in our engagement with the city attorney's office on the filing thought it was--when I say we, I mean myself and Council President Gonzalez, thought it was really important to under score the fact that although serious force has been greatly reduced, there still remains a very concerning disparity, racial disparity among use of force.",49,,
314,0.97,2956.753,2967.798,They document that and identify it as an area for continued and necessary progress.,49,,
315,0.97,2967.798,3004.534,"The reports identified the fact that SPD has been identified by outside groups as a national leader and crisis response training, and that SPD, there is the filings that show the SPD does not engage in no suspicion stop and Frisk tactics and finally SPD and the community police Commission collaborated to design and implement high quality bias training and to study the sources and effects of racial disparity and policing.",49,,
316,0.97,3004.534,3038.335,A couple of other items that the filings and reports that I Referenced below identified is the patrol staffing and super vision model to ensure that patrol officers have a consistent and trained supervisor and the recognition that the OPA conducts thorough and complete investigations and has adopted several key recommendations from the monitor and the Department of justice.,49,,
317,0.97,3038.335,3067.731,"And so, again, important to recognize that there is still another piece of work that is going to be necessary for us to engage in and that relates specifically to the findings of Judge Robard as it relates to police accountability and significant body of work that we're going to have to do prior to an August filing in that area.",49,,
318,0.97,3067.731,3137.234,"The other item that I wanted to raise today is the fact that late last week, we found out from chief Scoggins that they're after analysis that was done after the closure of the bridge, that I requested very early on and I'm sure others did as well in the public is this concern around the availability of police--I'm sorry, fire resources to address engineers on the peninsula and the impact of the bridge closure and as a result of those inquiries, the police, I'm sorry, the fire chief last week announced that Úthey had received approval from the Mayor's office who added an additional ladder, as well as an additional emergency response vehicle to address some of those needs.",49,,
319,0.97,3137.234,3147.511,"I believe that is going to, we can expect some of those resources to come to the peninsula in June.",49,,
320,0.97,3147.511,3149.713,That is all I have.,49,,
321,0.97,3149.713,3150.013,Thank you.,49,,
322,0.97,3150.013,3153.183,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for that report.",50,,
323,0.97,3153.183,3158.788,Really appreciate your ongoing partnership on the issues related to the consent decree.,50,,
324,0.97,3158.788,3171.268,"For me, I wanted to emphasize that this is not particularly as it relates to police accountability issues is not a mission accomplished scenario.",50,,
325,0.97,3171.268,3209.239,"That work is important for us to continue to make sure that we are fully supporting and Resourcing our Civilian-Led accountability system which includes the community and police Commission to ensure that when officers engage in misconduct, that they are held accountable and there is a lot more work we need to do as it relates to the folks who are on the committee to make sure that we have a contract that is going to reflect those priorities to the greatest extent possible.",50,,
326,0.97,3209.239,3228.525,So this is another step forward in the consent decree process but certainly should not be taken as a mission accomplished message by anyone by any means as it relates to ongoing work for accountability system and related discipline issues.,50,,
327,0.97,3228.525,3228.892,Appreciate that.,50,,
328,0.97,3228.892,3237.267,"And I just really want to thank you as well, Council President, for helping to send that message as well as everybody else on the Council.",51,,
329,0.97,3237.267,3254.985,We have had discussions with the law Department about how important we feel it is that we don't send that mission accomplished message while moving forward.,51,,
330,0.97,3254.985,3263.426,I thank everybody on the Council deserves may thanks for helping to be resolved in that strategy.,51,,
331,0.97,3263.426,3263.927,Thank you.,52,,

431,0.97,3935.798,3943.472,I had an opportunity last Tuesday to join a senior class at Lakeside school on the history of Seattle.,61,,
432,0.97,3943.472,3954.65,They will have a final project to create a time capsule for future generations to catch a glimpse of the future generations.,61,,

434,0.97,3962.391,3964.66,I met with Greenways in Seattle.,61,,
435,0.97,3964.66,3973.235,"As you know, where they intersect it is about expanding options for safe, affordable and sustainable transportation and recreation.",61,,
436,0.97,3973.235,3988.084,"For 350, we focused on, you know, of course, they are a group fighting climate change this is a continuation of the work we have been doing with Seattle neighborhood Greenways.",61,,
437,0.97,3988.084,4007.57,"In a meeting with Alice Lockhart at 350, we discussed how district five residents were responding to the open streets program, how we can use other public space for public use and the mutual interest in seeing the number of recreational access expand in D5.",61,,
438,0.97,4007.57,4016.112,Local bike shops are sending out of the inventories of bikes as folks take advantage of less congestion on the roads.,61,,

440,0.97,4023.586,4040.669,"I want to thank others for inviting me and giving me an opportunity to share what we're doing city-wide, certainly some of the issues city wide or nationally, but also of course, what is going on with updates.",61,,
441,0.97,4040.669,4042.705,That is all I have.,61,,
442,0.97,4042.705,4043.005,Thank you.,61,,
443,0.97,4043.005,4047.91,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez, for that report.",62,,

447,0.97,4056.585,4057.787,"Thank you, Madam President.",63,,
448,0.97,4057.787,4061.524,I don't have much to report this week.,63,,
449,0.97,4061.524,4071.133,There is no items on today's introduction referral or full council meeting from the select Committee on homelessness and investments.,63,,
450,0.97,4071.133,4075.037,I want to thank the Council's indulgence in having the presentation from the public defender Association.,63,,
451,0.97,4075.037,4086.048,It was great to hear from the work that they are doing and I appreciated the opportunity to work with the Council President's office and bringing that presentation together this morning.,63,,
452,0.97,4086.048,4093.055,There is a great deal of interest over the last couple of weeks in Scaling a Co-L.E.A.D.,63,,
453,0.97,4093.055,4097.56,As a program that we can take advantage of here in the city of Seattle.,63,,
454,0.97,4097.56,4099.395,A Grat deal of interest on the Council.,63,,
455,0.97,4099.395,4123.085,"A great deal of interest with the Mayor's office, human services Department, and the various business and neighborhood districts around the city, stake holders of which have been, I'm very excited of the prospect of getting some kind of intervention and partnership, especially where existing partnerships with L.E.A.D.",63,,
456,0.97,4123.085,4124.053,Are already in effect.,63,,
457,0.97,4124.053,4129.024,I look forward to continuing that Partnrship and it was good to hear from them this morning.,63,,
458,0.97,4129.024,4136.465,"Some of the stuff going on this week, I would be participating in the monthly meeting.",63,,
459,0.97,4136.465,4137.766,I'll be there virtually.,63,,
460,0.97,4137.766,4139.168,Tomorrow it is 6:00 P.M.,63,,
461,0.97,4139.168,4156.685,To talk about some of the things that we have been doing in Covid that Councilmember Juarez talked about in her update as well as the other long-term projects we might do to have a sustainable environmental and Urbanous city.,63,,
462,0.97,4156.685,4170.432,I'll have a meeting on Friday along with Councilmember Morales with the small business recovery task force hopefully to talk about some of the way ways we can leverage future actions in Congress.,63,,
463,0.97,4170.432,4192.054,"This should be happening over the next couple of weeks to try to get more relief for city and of course, the people of the city, not only in terms of supporting the small businesses but in terms of supporting the Renters and other folks who have been hit hard by unemployment and hard ship during the Covid-19 crisis, so I'm looking forward to that.",63,,
464,0.97,4192.054,4215.11,"I'm going to be sitting down with Brian Callahan at the Seattle channel tomorrow to talk about the city's homelessness response, and otherwise, we'll be available as always for meetings with constituents in district 7, there are quite a few of the meetings scheduled for this week and I'm looking forward to those as usual.",63,,
465,0.97,4215.11,4225.754,Otherwise I don't have any further updates today but look forward to another week of Council business.,63,,
466,0.97,4225.754,4230.859,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, any questions or comments on that report?",64,,
467,0.97,4230.859,4236.966,"Seeing and hearing none, we'll move along.",64,,
468,0.97,4236.966,4238.634,Next up is Councilmember Morales.,64,,
469,0.97,4238.634,4239.702,Thank you.,65,,
470,0.97,4239.702,4257.419,"Good morning, everybody, today, let's see, this afternoon we'll be voting on Council bill 119 which would prevent Renters by prohibiting landlords from considering Evictions related to the Covid-19 emergency as a way to deny future housing.",65,,
471,0.97,4257.419,4261.49,This is a pretty straight forward piece of legislation.,65,,
472,0.97,4261.49,4273.869,"It provides protection from housing discrimination stemming from this crisis and I do want to thank the tenant's Union, got real change in the housing justice project for making the legislation as strong as possible.",65,,
473,0.97,4273.869,4279.441,Thanks to my other colleagues who we have had lots of conversations with over the last few weeks.,65,,
474,0.97,4279.441,4282.611,I look forward to passing this legislation this afternoon.,65,,
475,0.97,4282.611,4290.486,I want to address the decision to spend the discussion on the revenue legislation.,65,,
476,0.97,4290.486,4294.623,The Coronavirus up ended all of our lives.,65,,
477,0.97,4294.623,4295.991,Seeing record breaking small business closures.,65,,
478,0.97,4295.991,4304.933,Many lost their jobs and have no way to pay for basic needs some have lost loved ones to Covid-19.,65,,
479,0.97,4304.933,4321.517,"Given the magnitude of the crisis that our communities are facing, it is hard to imagine how not governing is the appropriate response for elected officials yet the governor requires that local government only address issues that are quote, Unquote, routine.",65,,
480,0.97,4321.517,4339.201,"It is clear that there is nothing routine about Coronavirus or the need to respond to the crisis, our Council leadership made a choice to enforce the strictest legal interpretation of the governor.",65,,
481,0.97,4339.201,4353.349,"The crucial conversation about emergency relief is halted and for now, the select budget committee meetings have cancelled and the legislation Council members Sawant and I Co-Sponsored is delayed until the proclamation expires.",65,,
482,0.97,4353.349,4359.288,"I want to say again, as I said before, I wasn't elected to tell my community what we can't do.",65,,
483,0.97,4359.288,4370.032,I was elected to help lead the city even through a crisis and even when it is hard and I'm not giving up on the fight to help our neighbors.,65,,
484,0.97,4370.032,4381.143,"We'll be working to craft the legislation, support the emergency relief measures, address critical housing and food insecurity and issues faced by our neighbors.",65,,
485,0.97,4381.143,4399.495,"Tens of thousands of our con Stitents, hundreds of thousands of Seattleites have been left twisting in the wind and without immediate financial relief, many R will have no way to financially recover from the crisis.",65,,
486,0.97,4399.495,4412.474,"This effectively pulls the rug out for other people already on the brink of disaster and it is a disaster that none of us could have predicted but with emergency relief funds, we can help mitigate them.",65,,
487,0.97,4412.474,4421.116,I look forward to continuing the education and expect there will be a budget hearing scheduled as soon as the governor's proclamation expires.,65,,
488,0.97,4421.116,4441.37,"One more thing, which is that last week legislation that I have been working on to shift the navigation team's roll to providing out reach rather than sweeping people, last week that legislation made its way on to Komo news despite the fact that I have had no communication with them.",65,,
489,0.97,4441.37,4446.542,"Now that it is there out in the public, we all know, we are working on the legislation.",65,,
490,0.97,4446.542,4463.559,"I think I have been pretty clear since long before I became an elected official that I don't think that Sweeps are the appropriate way to handle our homelessness crisis, so, and last week we saw how necessary it is to actually have policy on the books during this crisis.",65,,
491,0.97,4463.559,4479.107,"So once we're on the other side of this, you can expect to see more legislation from this office that helps protect our homelessness neighbors--our homeless neighbors.",65,,
492,0.97,4479.107,4479.608,That is all I have.,65,,
493,0.97,4479.608,4484.313,Any questions or comments on that report?,66,,
494,0.97,4484.313,4491.053,"Hearing none, we'll move through the roll call.",66,,
495,0.97,4491.053,4493.088,Next up is Councilmember Mosqueda.,66,,
496,0.97,4493.088,4495.424,"Good morning, everyone, thank you so much.",67,,
497,0.97,4495.424,4501.83,I hope you all had a good mother's day and happy mother's day to your mothers as well.,67,,
498,0.97,4501.83,4505.734,I hope you had a chance to socially distance and enjoy family from afar this weekend.,67,,
499,0.97,4505.734,4518.647,"We saw a lot of people engaging in mini group gatherings and I think that it is a sign that we are all eager to get out and enjoy life as normal, but this is not the time to get out and enjoy life as normal.",67,,
500,0.97,4518.647,4531.527,We need to make sure that we're socially distancing and that means engaging with friends and family from afar and I know that I called my mom via zoom when I would have much preferred to go and see her.,67,,
501,0.97,4531.527,4545.741,I hope people continue to take the governor's orders to socially distance and to be very cautious of the concern that the Covid is going to potentially Respike if we engage in social activities prior to when it is safe.,67,,
502,0.97,4545.741,4563.992,"I want to also start with the comments about the select budget committee as you saw last Thursday, the select budget committee meeting was scheduled for this week that has been cancelled following the guidance issued by the Council President based on evolving legal advice from the city attorneys office.",67,,
503,0.97,4563.992,4567.996,This was based on their reading of the governor's orders.,67,,
504,0.97,4567.996,4570.699,I want to clarify for our colleagues in the public.,67,,
505,0.97,4570.699,4575.938,I fully support the Council president and followed her direction.,67,,
506,0.97,4575.938,4583.345,"That, however, does not mean I agree with Herbold's assessment of the legal assessment as was reported in the news.",67,,
507,0.97,4583.345,4584.78,This is not Councilmember Herbold's assessment.,67,,
508,0.97,4584.78,4588.717,This is the legal advice we have been dealt so far and that is what I disagree with.,67,,
509,0.97,4588.717,4606.368,"I did say I agree it is important that when we do pass progressive revenue, it doesn't have questions hanging over it, and we benefit in having the public engage in the process and that is what the guidance was aimed in.",67,,
510,0.97,4606.368,4612.541,How do we have full engagement of the process as allowed by the executive order and not be in violation of it.,67,,
511,0.97,4612.541,4619.481,My ongoing concern with the legal advice that we have been dealt is that we don't know when we'll be able to engage in person safely.,67,,
512,0.97,4619.481,4628.357,"To that end, I'll be asking follow up questions to our legal team and beyond about the Opma policy as it stands as well.",67,,
513,0.97,4628.357,4635.33,I think common sense would tell us this crisis is urgent and the funding emergency demands a response and relief.,67,,
514,0.97,4635.33,4636.665,Now and in the long-term.,67,,
515,0.97,4636.665,4638.967,The legal advice says otherwise and that doesn't make sense.,67,,
516,0.97,4638.967,4648.51,We know that there is a spike in recent days here on the Pacific Northwest as people have begun to reenter the local economy and have closer interactions.,67,,
517,0.97,4648.51,4655.884,"We know that there is going to be a resurgence as we have seen in other areas of the globe, for example in Seoul.",67,,
518,0.97,4655.884,4664.092,They had to reimpose a shut down of various nature as people began to engage in life as normal and they saw increased spikes of Covid.,67,,
519,0.97,4664.092,4676.738,"We also know that it is important no matter when we do come back to in person meetings that we first protect the staff, city workers and attendees.",67,,
520,0.97,4676.738,4682.878,That is the priority in President's guidance and important for us to implement her recommendations as we seek clarification.,67,,
521,0.97,4682.878,4689.551,"As we seek clarification on the lead guidance, we don't want to be in violation of the existing legal guidance but the need continues to grow.",67,,
522,0.97,4689.551,4696.058,We have seen the Brookings report just last week record a number of--a record number of kids going hungry.,67,,
523,0.97,4696.058,4705.333,We have heard from small businesses who have vendors that they were not able to pay for the March invoices because there were no profits in April and that will continue to spiral.,67,,
524,0.97,4705.333,4711.173,We have seen the Federal cash assistance leave out populations that the city has historically stepped in to provide assistance.,67,,
525,0.97,4711.173,4720.882,That is why I think it is imperative for us to think outside of the box and will be doing so with the state and local partners as we look at what it means to Reengage.,67,,
526,0.97,4720.882,4726.588,There will continue to be compound AG problems over the next 18 months and probably two to three years.,67,,
527,0.97,4726.588,4736.498,"That is what we have heard over the weekend when we think about what the quote, immediate impact will be, we need to think in two or three year categories, not one two to three months.",67,,
528,0.97,4736.498,4750.746,"So as we think more broadly about this crisis, the questions that I'll continue to ask mean whether or not we need to Revalate the Opma.",67,,
529,0.97,4750.746,4765.026,This is no one effort to make sure we're responding not just to the economic crisis but the ongoing public health crisis that will continue to be in the backyard for the next few years the legal analysis is what it is for now.,67,,
530,0.97,4765.026,4776.538,I want to reiterate I'm committed to practicing sustainable revenue to respond to the crisis and lingering effects and I look forward to engaging with all of you and all of the public in that process as soon as we're allowed.,67,,
531,0.97,4776.538,4792.287,"My hope and my plan is to reconvene the meetings when we have the opportunity to do so, when we're allowed to do so within the first ten days of June, assuming we're able to meet in person or there is a change in Opma policy.",67,,
532,0.97,4792.287,4825.62,"In the meantime, I continue to look at opportunities to engage with the public, whether that is trying to get alternative options for people to talk about what the crisis is, not to talk about bills, because we're going to be within the confines of the legal advice that they have given us but to talk about the evolving crisis, whether from Healthcare providers or economists, Renters and small landlords, I would love to engage in the public with a better understanding about how communities and families and workers are being affected.",67,,
533,0.97,4825.62,4848.51,"To this end, I'm looking at hosting potentially town halls or some other form of public engagement over the next two weeks as we try to shed light on the evolving public health crisis and the impact in Seattle, so stay tuned for those up coming events and I would love to work with all of you as we think about local and national experts who can shed light on this crisis.",67,,
534,0.97,4848.51,4874.102,I want to make sure folks know that we will continue to keep you updated if there is any policy that does meet the guidance that was outlined in the Council President's memo that would be appropriate for the committee given the current legal parameters and appreciate ongoing efforts to a mend possible legislation to make sure it meets the effort as we seek greater legal advice or clarification on policy from the state.,67,,
535,0.97,4874.102,4882.11,"I want to thank the Council president for her guidance, while it is only two weeks, we know that there is an immense need out there.",67,,
536,0.97,4882.11,4894.322,"We look forward with continuing to engage with all of you as we redefine what it means to have an immediate crisis that needs to be addressed over the next few years, not necessarily the next few months.",67,,
537,0.97,4894.322,4900.595,"Council colleagues, on the full agenda, item number 3 is 119785.",67,,
538,0.97,4900.595,4908.603,This bill would first adopt the final 2020 action plan.,67,,
539,0.97,4908.603,4919.914,"Approve the Submittal to the House HUD and third, a mend 126000 which adopted the 2020 budget.",67,,
540,0.97,4919.914,4924.853,The funds are in addition to the Federal grants being considered in Council bill 119783.,67,,
541,0.97,4924.853,4937.666,We had an official public hearing on this last week and we look forward to hopefully passing the bill today.,67,,
542,0.97,4937.666,4959.621,"Finally as we had hoped there would be additional conversations last week related to exactly the presentation on how we Dedensefy shelters and get people into individual rooms, as of 10:30 this morning, we don't have an update for you on the bill that we discussed last week, which is Council bill 119783.",67,,
543,0.97,4959.621,4978.206,"So as of right now I am prepared to ask this Council for your indulgence to potentially walk on legislation to Council bill 119783 that passed last week, which would accept appropriated Federal and state funds related to Covid-19 pandemic crisis response, including cares act funding.",67,,
544,0.97,4978.206,4988.783,"As you will remember, when the council passed the legislation we held back $1.4 million of CDBG funds through a substitute I sponsors.",67,,
545,0.97,4988.783,5027.722,"The legislation I would potentially walk up for the introduction and referral calendar, not for vote, but would key us up for a possible vote next week if needed would appropriate the remaining funds to shelter De-Densification and while I am hopeful that the ongoing conversations that began last week will conclude this week and will appropriate general funds to assist with the homeless service providers needs around personnel, staffing, meal delivery, and individual rooms, we know that those conversations have not concluded yet.",67,,
546,0.97,5027.722,5039.3,"To be very clear, my hope is that the conversations that we have Teed up to happen at the administrative level through the office, Hsd office of housing, that those will hopefully conclude this week.",67,,
547,0.97,5039.3,5063.291,"That if we're able to walk on the legislation for the introduction and referral calendar this week, you will see that we have a title that is broad enough to allow for us to a mend the legislation to free up the $1.4 million for things like rental assistance, which is critical for myself, Councilmember Herbold and a number of people hoping to receive progress on the legislation.",67,,
548,0.97,5063.291,5072.801,Cdc guidance and the public health guidance says settings are no longer considered safe due to under lying health conditions or their age.,67,,
549,0.97,5072.801,5090.552,"I'm hopeful that the executive will continue to give us an update today on how the conversations are going and colleagues, again, my hope is that we can tee up this legislation to the extent that we need it either to put 1.4 million into De-Densification or free it up for the rental assistance.",67,,
550,0.97,5090.552,5100.128,Sophie's choice is there but we wanted legislation ready to go next Monday through either of those paths.,67,,
551,0.97,5100.128,5104.432,Amy Gore has sent around an E-mail with that draft legislation.,67,,
552,0.97,5104.432,5120.548,"If there are any updates before 2:00 p.m.'s full council meeting, we'll make sure to let colleagues know this is a place holder for now and really appreciate your ongoing work as we try to make sure that we support De-Densification, operating needs related to staff, Ppe, cleaning and food service.",67,,
553,0.97,5120.548,5123.418,"Council President, thank you so much.",67,,
554,0.97,5123.418,5126.187,That concludes my long report.,67,,
555,0.97,5126.187,5142.003,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda, Councilmember Mosqueda, on the potential, I guess, the amendment that you have to the original Council bill a week later, is that--I'm a little unclear as to whether you're going to bring that forward this afternoon or not.",68,,
556,0.97,5142.003,5151.112,My intent would be to bring it forward as a walk on piece of legislation for the introduction and referral calendar.,69,,
557,0.97,5151.112,5152.08,Got it.,70,,
558,0.97,5152.08,5152.28,Okay.,70,,
559,0.97,5152.28,5163.091,"So just so folks know for this afternoon, that will require I believe us to suspend the rules since it wasn't circulated on Friday.",70,,
560,0.97,5163.091,5179.107,"Nt an issue, just want to make sure folks are aware that that will be a pressure a procedural thing we will have to do.",70,,
561,0.97,5179.107,5183.511,Again it would just be addition.,70,,
562,0.97,5183.511,5186.814,"Thank you for the reminder, yes.",71,,
563,0.97,5186.814,5187.081,Great.,72,,
564,0.97,5187.081,5187.782,Thank you so much.,72,,
565,0.97,5187.782,5192.32,Any other questions or comments for Councilmember Mosqueda?,72,,
566,0.97,5192.32,5193.288,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",72,,
567,0.97,5193.288,5196.724,Thank you so much.,73,,
568,0.97,5196.724,5243.871,"Councilmember Mosqueda's comments related to specifically the De-Densification work necessary for shelters and the city council support for the work and our efforts to get support from the executives to look at different ways of doing Dedensification of shelters reminded me of an item that I wanted to raise in my Committee report and that is specifically the fact that on Friday, the Southwest teen life center announced that they would temporarily shelter youth from youth cares, Jackson street, overnight shelter.",73,,
569,0.97,5243.871,5252.413,"The move will provide 24/7 shelter space, supportive services, and more space for social distancing per public health guidance.",73,,
570,0.97,5252.413,5263.958,The program itself supports youth between the ages of 18 and 24 and youth at the location will be provided access to showers and three meals a day.,73,,
571,0.97,5263.958,5281.509,This is an action announced a couple of months ago and it has taken some time to get the arrangements between youth care and the city in place.,73,,
572,0.97,5281.509,5286.814,"On Friday, I believe, five young people moved to this location.",73,,
573,0.97,5286.814,5307.935,"I think it is really interesting to note that in the efforts to De-Intensify the Jackson Street overnight shelter, the youth at the shelter were given a couple of different options to choose from and this was the option that they selected at the Southwest teen life center.",73,,
574,0.97,5307.935,5339.267,One of the things for me that really under scores the city's efforts to find an approach toward De-Intensification is how the city's explanation of how that location is going to have the capacity to hold people really differs from that of youth care.,73,,
575,0.97,5339.267,5356.284,"The city is talking about that location potentially holding up to 30 individuals, but in its wisdom, the city is deferring to youth care to determine how many young people actually go and so they're starting with five.",73,,
576,0.97,5356.284,5382.643,I think what needs to have happen is that a determination of the capacity of that location really needs to be guided by the use of the site and how much social distancing is possible in that location so that we're not just replicating dense capacity of new locations.,73,,
577,0.97,5382.643,5432.493,"Really, you know, appreciative of the human services Department and youth care in moving this forward but I think this is a really good example of what we're all struggling within trying to figure out how to do De-Intensification and want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for her efforts in working with Hsd and the Mayor's office in trying to begin the De-Intensification approach that allows people to move into their own spaces with their own doors and follow really the CDC best practices efforts and follow the work that we have been watching King County do with success.",73,,
578,0.97,5432.493,5432.76,So thank you.,73,,
579,0.97,5433.06,5443.504,Councilmember Pedersen.,74,,
580,0.97,5453.714,5461.456,"But good morning, colleagues and happy day after mother's day, especially to our Moms on the city council.",74,,
581,0.97,5461.456,5470.097,There is one item on today's Council agenda which normally comes from the transportation committee.,74,,
582,0.97,5470.097,5480.908,"The working group, utilities committee includes oversight of the government information technology Department.",74,,
583,0.97,5480.908,5486.18,This is a community advisory Úgroup that supports the analysis of new technologies at the request of the ACLU of Washington.,74,,

586,0.97,5507.535,5517.845,We are all grateful for those who work at Nonprofits and do the hard work to serve the most vulnerable.,74,,
587,0.97,5517.845,5520.281,As usual I will have virtual office hours this Friday afternoon.,74,,

591,0.97,5528.823,5531.259,Any questions or comments?,75,,
592,0.97,5531.259,5538.165,We will go ahead and move along to the next Councilmember and that is Councilmember Sawant.,75,,
593,0.97,5538.165,5538.966,The floor is yours.,75,,
594,0.97,5538.966,5543.037,"Thank you, good morning everyone.",76,,
595,0.97,5543.037,5561.489,"No items from the Sustainability Council, I am happy to cosponsor the rental filed against them during the Covid-19 moratorium.",76,,
596,0.97,5561.489,5577.605,The residents of the House of the Mobile home park alongside have requested that the Council extend the temporary zoning restrictions that protected them from displacement over the last couple years.,76,,
597,0.97,5577.605,5585.513,We were along with the moving testimony and tremendous solidarity they received from the community citywide.,76,,
598,0.97,5585.513,5600.595,The council passed Sony protection on the basis of the time for the executive to do the work that was necessary to make those or other zoning protections permanent.,76,,
599,0.97,5600.595,5631.158,The Mayor has not Prioritized protecting the homes of the residents in the park and have made no progress on the zoning work so we will have a vote for that temporary extension and I should mention the residents of this are seniors who if they lost this home would almost certainly face homelessness but otherwise housing instability which would be dangerous at any time but especially during the pandemic.,76,,
600,0.97,5631.158,5635.062,Staff is preparing legislation from my office.,76,,
601,0.97,5635.062,5638.532,Please have your staff contact my office if there are any questions or concerns.,76,,
602,0.97,5638.532,5665.126,Over the last few days I have heard from many community members who are angry and outraged at the Democratic establishment to postpone the vote on legislation to fund immediate Covid release a long time program for an expansion of housing and green new deal programs that will be required to recover from the Covid emergency.,76,,
603,0.97,5665.126,5684.178,The idea that we cannot address the Covid emergency in a new way because we are in the emergency would be Bizarrely hilarious if they were not peoples lives and livelihoods on the line and the idea were not politicians with the greed of big business.,76,,
604,0.97,5684.178,5702.596,The argument that our virtual open broadcast recorded Council meetings are not open enough justifying canceling those meetings and claiming this is in defense of open meetings is truly something you cannot make up.,76,,
605,0.97,5702.596,5736.831,"This argument is being made by Council members and joined by the political establishment but these Council members, these two were among the politicians two years ago, almost exactly, who were among the politicians who conspired behind closed doors to repeal the movement that year in 2018 and another Backroom deal which was in flagrant violation of the public meeting and taken to court and they had to settle the case with taxpayer money.",76,,
606,0.97,5736.831,5737.465,It is stunning.,76,,
607,0.97,5737.465,5762.189,"Ultimately we have to remember these are excuses that are covers for actually what is going on which is loyalty to big business and because the movement had momentum and has momentum and because there is tremendous community support behind big business, not only in Seattle but nationwide, shows this is a popular idea, especially as the economy has gone in recession.",76,,
608,0.97,5762.189,5768.762,Politicians who want progressive credentials are having to result to Legalistic maneuvers.,76,,
609,0.97,5768.762,5784.111,Ultimately what is at stake is this tax on Seattle's big is this and to help address housing Affordability and create good jobs through a major expansion of social housing and green new deal.,76,,
610,0.97,5784.111,5791.485,"It's not just this program and this one city, this is related to what is emerging nationwide and globally.",76,,
611,0.97,5791.485,5797.591,"We are heading into a depression, clearly somebody will have to pay for this crisis.",76,,
612,0.97,5797.591,5799.36,The question is who will pay?,76,,
613,0.97,5799.36,5801.362,Big is Miss or the working people?,76,,
614,0.97,5801.362,5808.135,The politicians refused to tax the wealthy and are not taking a neutral position.,76,,
615,0.97,5808.135,5813.007,They are helping ensure the cost of the crisis will be paid for by working people.,76,,
616,0.97,5813.007,5821.081,"In the form of profound and prolonged joblessness, Impoverishment and budgets slashing underfunded social programs.",76,,
617,0.97,5821.081,5822.349,This is a mathematical outcome.,76,,
618,0.97,5822.349,5823.317,It will happen.,76,,
619,0.97,5823.317,5827.021,If we don't text business and the wealthy.,76,,
620,0.97,5827.021,5840.634,"They are helping to ensure the elite, major shareholders, millionaires, Multimillionaires and Billionaires, were not only shielded from the Ravage of the recession but in fact are Profiteering from the crisis.",76,,
621,0.97,5840.634,5863.39,"Already the introduced policy studies as of April 15, his fortune increased by $25 billion since January 1 and over 22 million people lost their jobs, over the same three weeks, U.S. billionaire wealth increased by $282 billion and almost 10% gain.",76,,
622,0.97,5863.39,5879.607,It was only because of organized mass movements especially the historic general strikes led by Socialist leaders in the labor movement that Thefederal government under FDR was finally forced to enact the new deal programs.,76,,
623,0.97,5879.607,5885.913,That is the kind of mass organizing we will need and will not be led by establishment politicians.,76,,
624,0.97,5885.913,5891.018,It will be led by working people and organizations themselves.,76,,
625,0.97,5891.018,5898.292,Our movement will not sit back and accept this attempt by the city's Democratic establishment who are lawyer to big business and shut down the conversation.,76,,
626,0.97,5898.292,5920.414,Community members will be rallying this afternoon outside city hall in a socially distanced event . My offices hosting a town hall meeting and if you want to stand with working people you are most welcome to join me and members there and I certainly look Forwad to Cosponsoring the town hall.,76,,
627,0.97,5920.414,5928.155,Thank you.,76,,
628,0.97,5928.155,5938.932,Any questions or comments for Councilmember Sawant on her report?,77,,
629,0.97,5938.932,5944.038,"Okay, hearing none, I will go ahead and go on to my report.",77,,
630,0.97,5944.038,5950.878,We do not have any legislation on today's full council agenda.,77,,
631,0.97,5950.878,5957.217,And those meetings are canceled until further notice consistent with the governor's order and proclamations.,77,,
632,0.97,5957.217,5973.901,"One item that is on today's full council agenda, that his counsel bill 119-788, this is the second and follow up piece of legislation I have introduced for tenant protections related to the Covid-19 crisis.",77,,
633,0.97,5973.901,5999.86,"This bill were create flexibility to use payment plans with landlords, it is straightforward, and for this bill we have incorporated input from a lot of different Stakeholders including the agency, and as well as Stakeholders from Washington, the housing justice project and the Washington multifamily housing Association.",77,,
634,0.97,5999.86,6029.556,I want to thank all of those folks for being willing to have conversations with my office about how to improve upon this really important legislation that will again create a Pathway for tenants to create payment plans with the landlords in the aftermath and process of recovering from this crisis in order to make sure that housing stability continues and that they don't end up being evicted for falling behind on rent.,77,,
635,0.97,6029.556,6039.466,We do have I should who will brief us on the bill.,77,,
636,0.97,6039.466,6040.267,Are you still there?,77,,
637,0.97,6040.267,6043.537,There you are.,77,,
638,0.97,6043.537,6050.377,"Can you give us a quick, quick summary of the bill and its components . that would be great.",77,,
639,0.97,6050.377,6056.95,I know there is an update in terms of potential amendment that might longer be introduced.,77,,
640,0.97,6056.95,6061.588,Absolutely.,78,,
641,0.97,6061.588,6073.6,"So, as the Council President mentioned this bill would create an option to pay back rent on a payment plan.",78,,
642,0.97,6073.6,6095.923,"This bill was reintroduced as a substitute to accommodate a title change but essentially the bill just allows a landlord to, excuse me, a tenant to use the payment plan either laid out in the bill or if they have a proposal and the landlord AGREES to it can pay back rent on that alternative schedule.",78,,
643,0.97,6095.923,6111.538,The bill also provides for a no late fee interest or other charges for rental accrued for a year after the end of the civil emergency.,78,,
644,0.97,6111.538,6132.392,"We added provisions around notice, the fact that members put Lotus on Eviction notice about the rights the tenants have and it prohibits fees, otherwise allowed by state law but with the intent that attorneys fees would not be allowed.",78,,
645,0.97,6132.392,6146.573,"And I just note that this does not conflict with the governor's order, it sets a floor protections around rental payment plans and late fees and the city is adding to those protections.",78,,
646,0.97,6146.573,6158.285,Originally there was one amendment to this bill proposed by Councilmember Herbold to extend the payment plan out to 12 months but that is no longer being offered.,78,,
647,0.97,6158.285,6161.555,That is all I have.,78,,
648,0.97,6161.555,6167.261,"Councilmember Herbold, do you want to make any remarks?",79,,
649,0.97,6167.261,6168.862,"No, you're good?",79,,
650,0.97,6168.862,6183.51,"Any questions or comments about the bill for Asha who will not be available at the full Council, I want to make sure that you know that this is your one shot at the Council staff.",79,,
651,0.97,6183.51,6187.714,"Okay, thank you, Asha, for calling in this morning.",79,,
652,0.97,6187.714,6207.234,"I appreciate all of the work that you and the office have done to engage with the executive departments and also with external Stakeholders, really exciting about advancing this important tenant protection legislation this afternoon.",79,,
653,0.97,6207.234,6212.539,A lot of gratitude for your hard work and making sure it is all buttoned up.,79,,
654,0.97,6212.539,6216.009,"Thank you so much, Asha.",79,,
655,0.97,6216.009,6259.987,"Okay, the only other thing that I will bring up really quickly is I know we've been having a lot of conversations about the governor's proclamation 20-28, I issued a memorandum last week on Wednesday, providing guidance, not a mandate, not a directive, to each of you as Councilmembers who had your individual authority as chairs of your committees about the risks and associations with moving legislation that may not be responsive to the Covid-19 and the current public health crisis or routine and necessary.",79,,
656,0.97,6259.987,6311.271,"I understand that memo is concerning to a lot of you, equally concerning to me, I think that it is difficult to have continuity of government when our hands are so severely tied as a result of proclamation 20-28 and for our colleagues, Sawant and Morales who apparently think I take great joy in stopping a conversation about progressive revenue I want to correct the record on that, it gives me no joy to give guidance that requires us to comply so strictly with the legal advice I have seen and with the reading of the proclamation and guidance that has been issued by the Attorney General's office.",79,,
657,0.97,6311.271,6324.251,If this counsel and it's chairs of the committees want to assume the risk associated with knowingly and intentionally violating the open public meetings act that is within your authority to do.,79,,
658,0.97,6324.251,6337.497,"So when their comments made about taxpayers money being paid to settle lawsuits that's exactly what would happen, I believe, if we proceed with this conversation in such a reckless manner.",79,,
659,0.97,6337.497,6368.161,I also think this legislation and any alternative proposals related to revenue generation that would be critical to the recovery of people that we all love and care for deeply who are constituents in this city is so important that we cannot move forward a package of legislation that will inevitably result in a myriad and a flood of lawsuits that will almost immediately cancel that legislation out because we did not comply with the open public meetings act.,79,,
660,0.97,6368.161,6370.764,"To be clear, I didn't write the Act.",79,,
661,0.97,6370.764,6373.266,That is a state statute.,79,,
662,0.97,6373.266,6373.5,Okay?,79,,
663,0.97,6373.5,6384.578,I have been doing advocacy in the background to request that the proclamation be softened slightly to account for the realities of how technology works today.,79,,
664,0.97,6384.578,6389.783,"This been a lot of comments about how we are doing public comment Online, why is it sufficient?",79,,
665,0.97,6389.783,6399.226,I must be some sort of Crazy person because I somehow don't appreciate technology and its utility in these settings.,79,,
666,0.97,6399.226,6399.626,Trust me.,79,,
667,0.97,6399.626,6400.093,I do.,79,,
668,0.97,6400.093,6415.642,It's exactly why I advocated to the governor's office and to the Attorney General's office and the office of Intergovernmental relations to request that the proclamation be modified to account for the realities of technology.,79,,
669,0.97,6415.642,6419.446,In the Modern-Day pick Unfortunately the act is very strict.,79,,
670,0.97,6419.446,6439.466,It requires in person viewing so if a member of the public walks into City hall in Seattle or anywhere in the state they have an absolute right under the statute to set in chambers or anywhere else that is available to watch our proceedings.,79,,
671,0.97,6439.466,6444.07,That is a fundamental cornerstone to open the government.,79,,
672,0.97,6444.07,6446.94,Which we are obliged to follow.,79,,
673,0.97,6446.94,6456.116,If there are people in the Council who want to just disregard that I guess that is within your continued Purview to continue to do.,79,,
674,0.97,6456.116,6463.79,"Again, I am called upon to make tough decisions in this scenario is the lead of the legislative Department.",79,,
675,0.97,6463.79,6470.764,Acknowledge I will not make everybody happy all the time.,79,,
676,0.97,6470.764,6503.43,"I have limited this guidance because I want to make sure that the legislation moving forward will be able to be on the strongest ground possible and I also frankly and protective of the fact that I don't want the city Council to be, and each of you, to be put in the position of increased risk and liability related to any allegations that we have passed this legislation in a way that is inconsistent with the open public meetings act.",79,,
677,0.97,6503.43,6540.767,"I appreciate that it is a difficult situation for us to be in and also part of the reason why in my weekly call with the governor's office I advocate once again that when the state Legislature comes back, a special session or regular session, that there be a very hard look taken at reforming the open public meetings act to acknowledge the fact that we will be in a world of social distancing for many, many, months to come and having to exist under proclamation 20- 28 creates a crisis for the continuity of government.",79,,
678,0.97,6540.767,6579.606,I recognize that and I am working with other counsel Presidents including Council member--across the street to emphasize on behalf of this counsel that we need to see some modifications to the open public meetings act that allows us to promote the public health orders that have been issued and allow us to continue to do the important policy work that is not just related to the current public health crisis but also related to the recovery and to other delivery of services that we need to continue to engage in.,79,,
679,0.97,6579.606,6592.886,And existing under the strict rules and restrictions of proclamation 20-28 is not going to be easy to do in the long- term.,79,,
680,0.97,6592.886,6620.647,"Also collects I want to make sure that in the memo you saw that I am asking Monica Simmons from our clerks office and financial services to begin the process now of thinking about how to physically change City hall, including the chambers and the dais, to allow us to have in person public viewing.",79,,
681,0.97,6620.647,6647.507,"I hope is that we will be able to see those physical changes and that we will be able to effectively provide some type of in person viewing that is safe and consistent with the governor's Shelter-In-Place order should extend beyond May 31 and also is consistent with again, making sure that we have physical distancing for folks to participate if they choose to be here in person.",79,,
682,0.97,6647.507,6655.782,"So, again, my goal here is to make sure that operationally we are complying with the open public meetings act.",79,,
683,0.97,6655.782,6671.664,I share the frustration with many of you about the outcome of not being able to address either this legislation or any other legislation frankly that falls outside of the four corners of the proclamation.,79,,
684,0.97,6671.664,6705.932,"But this is our reality so proclamation 2028 exists and as long as this global pandemic persists in the way that it is persisting our operations will be directly impacted by it and I think, and I hope, that we can work together, Collaboratively, to try to figure out pathways, productive pathways, that still allow us to have a conversation about these really important issues while still complying with the open meetings act.",79,,
685,0.97,6705.932,6707.534,I believe that is possible.,79,,
686,0.97,6707.534,6709.636,Our restrictions are limited.,79,,
687,0.97,6709.636,6714.841,Not being able to have public meetings.,79,,
688,0.97,6714.841,6721.514,There is nothing that prevents us from continuing to have these important conversations about these important policy issues.,79,,
689,0.97,6721.514,6731.524,"You know, I'm heartened to hear folks who want to have Townhouse to have that conversation and I think that's really important.",79,,
690,0.97,6731.524,6749.375,We are strictly prohibited from being able to organize public meetings with the majority of state Councilmembers using committee structures to advance pieces of legislation that fall outside of the four corners of the proclamation 20-28.,79,,
691,0.97,6749.375,6773.6,"And I appreciate the ongoing conversation and again, I hope that we can do it in a respectful way as opposed to engaging in name-calling or subscribing ill intent and ill motive of these Smoky room, Backroom deals, I have no idea where these back rooms are so I don't know what that allegation is coming from.",79,,
692,0.97,6773.6,6779.606,I think I've been pretty transparent and share with all of you the legal advice I have received.,79,,
693,0.97,6779.606,6806.9,"I think Councilmember Herbold has been very transparent, I have put all of the cards on the table and continue to look forward to having conversations with each of you and with our law Department and figure out how to have a path forward to continue to engage in basic components of government and right now we have to do that within the construct of proclamation 20-28.",79,,
694,0.97,6806.9,6808.134,So I will end up there.,79,,
695,0.97,6808.134,6827.42,"I know that we have an executive session coming up where we will have an opportunity to engage with each other on this issue and other issues but, I'm happy to take any additional questions or comments before we go ahead and move into executive session.",79,,
696,0.97,6827.42,6831.224,"I do, this is Debora Juarez.",80,,
697,0.97,6831.224,6833.66,The floor is yours.,81,,
698,0.97,6833.66,6834.727,Thank you.,82,,
699,0.97,6834.727,6844.47,"I will reiterate something that I shared in March and April 6, again, let's not play politics in the midst of this pandemic.",82,,
700,0.97,6844.47,6847.473,I think we all know why we are elected to city council.,82,,
701,0.97,6847.473,6851.778,This is not a time to promote or try to undercut a movement.,82,,
702,0.97,6851.778,6874.567,"Quite frankly if we are going to start this nonsense again, us, them, whose more progressive, and some kind of Crazy contest, in the middle of a pandemic where we are trying to figure out how to save people's lives and economy, the accusations, again, about something being conspiratorial, I mean, again, not the time to be divisive or Accusatory.",82,,
703,0.97,6874.567,6883.076,We have seen enough that I just about every level and it is anymore horrific and I hope we keep it out of chambers.,82,,
704,0.97,6883.076,6899.626,"I want to thank Council president for keeping in mind and reiterating that the health concern here about us coming in and having the public in Chamber, particularly those of us with compromised immune system, this is a life or death situation.",82,,
705,0.97,6899.626,6903.997,"This is an about anyone trying to undercut a movement or not understanding our roles, all of the city of Seattle residents.",82,,
706,0.97,6903.997,6913.339,"Again, as I shared before, I have some concerns about this legislation, yes, I do, I was here when all of that with time.",82,,
707,0.97,6913.339,6917.744,I do have concerns about passing legislation without public comment.,82,,
708,0.97,6917.744,6925.952,This counsel has passed one tax and that was the sugar beverage tax.,82,,
709,0.97,6925.952,6927.754,This is what I want to leave us with.,82,,
710,0.97,6927.754,6942.769,"I am hoping for once we can have a healthy, robust, respectful discussion about a progressive tax which we all know we need and how we get that done.",82,,
711,0.97,6942.769,6953.146,"I am not interested and I am tired, quite frankly, of this nonsense of people playing politics in the middle of what we are going through.",82,,
712,0.97,6953.146,6954.38,I am just tired of it.,82,,
713,0.97,6954.38,6974.701,"I want to think Council member Herbold, Gonzalez, Mosqueda, and Sawant, you as well, when we went through this back in 2017 and 2018, seven months, in the end it was repealed.",82,,
714,0.97,6974.701,6978.871,Let's put our heads and minds and hearts together to do it right.,82,,
715,0.97,6978.871,6986.546,"Talking about lawsuits, pointing fingers, it's unnecessary and quite frankly immature.",82,,
716,0.97,6986.546,6988.081,It's just not right.,82,,
717,0.97,6988.081,7021.414,"I like what Councilmember, Council President Gonzalez said, we cannot pass this type of legislation, attacks if you will, and I can tell you right now, we will be again, sued again, and using taxpayer money for attacks in which we haven't had it fully Vetted, had the opportunity for the public to step up and tell us and everybody, I mean, everybody across the board, yes, we get 1000 Emails about a group and a movement, and I respect that.",82,,
718,0.97,7021.414,7026.052,But what I'm having hard time doing as an elected is weird starting down this road again.,82,,
719,0.97,7026.052,7031.557,That's not going to bring us closer together as a city Council to do the best we can for our people.,82,,
720,0.97,7031.557,7033.326,I will leave it at that.,82,,
721,0.97,7033.326,7035.561,Thank you.,82,,
722,0.97,7035.561,7038.464,"Thank you, any other comments or questions?",83,,
723,0.97,7038.464,7042.969,Councilmember Sawant?,83,,
724,0.97,7042.969,7061.788,"I have some questions on what your comments were about your read of what the Attorney General's, first of all, the guidance as far as I understand, it's not legally binding.",84,,
725,0.97,7061.788,7080.506,And I also would be curious to know what your understanding is of the legal basis for the Attorney General's office asserting that the open public meetings act requires in person attendance . I don't see anything in the statute that requires in person attendance.,84,,
726,0.97,7080.506,7176.369,"I see it says all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the governor body in the last three weeks this counsel has conducted meetings that have been attended Online by many people, dozens of people, contributing public comment, all public members have been allowed to attend and observe the meeting remotely, etc., I would just wonder how in your view is that participation falling short of the open public meetings that and if we are falling short, what is the legal basis and decision, etc., for that conclusion and I would just ask a question, Councilmember Herbold stated she attended a public meeting on the bridge situation attended by 3200 people and quote I couldn't tell if anyone shook their heads in disappointment, so one question is is there any standard in the Opma that requires officials to be observing facial expressions of members of the public, certainly in that case the majority of those wishing to attend or turned away, not in the same room where Councilmembers would see the facial expression, with that constitute an up public meetings act violation and if not, why not?",84,,
727,0.97,7176.369,7200.86,"Poorly, politically, I will say Councilmembers who have engaged in this decision do you care more about whatever of big business and the wealthy who oppose any tax at any time, not about now, it is anytime you talk about passing a big business tax, they will be opposed to it.",84,,
728,0.97,7200.86,7202.328,It seems you are more concerned about that.,84,,
729,0.97,7202.328,7205.865,"Many working people came at the time, two years ago and use other facial expressions.",84,,
730,0.97,7205.865,7226.118,You saw them and you heard them speak in anger and outrage saying how can you repeal a tax that we have fought for Inner- city knees because it's I don't accept this framing that this is part of the public health concern.,84,,
731,0.97,7226.118,7237.763,"If you are concerned about public health you would do everything in your power to pass attacks on big business but not just that, take all the measures that are necessary to make sure the burden of the crisis does not land on the poorest people.",84,,
732,0.97,7237.763,7249.475,By making this decision you are the ones playing politics and also I don't appreciate that movement led by ordinary people who are fighting for their lives is being termed as people who are playing politics.,84,,
733,0.97,7249.475,7260.286,They are fighting for their lives and for the rights and I think President Gonzalez you should know because you and others participated in that.,84,,
734,0.97,7260.286,7262.255,Everyone knows it is being documented.,84,,
735,0.97,7262.255,7264.056,Thank you.,84,,
736,0.97,7264.056,7281.807,"I think Councilmember Sawant, if you would spend some time with our city attorneys memo that gives us attorney client Glitch information you will have your questions answered and if you don't you'll have the opportunity to have those questions answered during the executive session.",85,,
737,0.97,7281.807,7284.01,I'm not the city attorney.,85,,
738,0.97,7284.01,7293.986,I would defer to city attorneys to be able to answer your questions including case law citations.,85,,
739,0.97,7293.986,7299.792,"I would not engage in that conversation publicly, again, spent some time with the memo and you might have your questions answered.",85,,
740,0.97,7299.792,7303.863,"I have that appear in front of me, currently.",85,,
741,0.97,7303.863,7328.754,"But, I do think that is part of the reason why we're having this executive session that is coming up and of course, that will be subject to attorney KARCHER village and that is an important opportunity for all Councilmembers to get a robust understanding of the legal basis in the legal support for the guidance that I had issued.",85,,
742,0.97,7328.754,7349.442,"So, again, we are bound by proclamation 20-28, binding on us and it did effectively change the standards around the Opma where we are trying to manage the spread of a deadly infection amongst our population.",85,,
743,0.97,7349.442,7360.586,"Yes, I do care about public health and the assertion by you, council member Sawant, that I don't care about public health is offensive.",85,,
744,0.97,7360.586,7362.855,And the reality is I do care.,85,,
745,0.97,7362.855,7378.904,That is exactly why I am asked to work on creating an opportunity for us to reconvene in chambers in a responsible manner that is also Compliant with public health orders and CDC recommendations.,85,,
746,0.97,7378.904,7389.415,"I will continue to center the health of our staff and the general public who wants to engage with us in person, in chambers, on this issue or any other issue.",85,,
747,0.97,7389.415,7404.73,I will center their health and my decision in making that I do not care for them because I don't support your perspective of how to move forward on this tax.,85,,
748,0.97,7404.73,7414.039,"So, I'm going to go ahead and call us into executive session because I think that is where we need to head at this point.",85,,
749,0.97,7414.039,7418.043,"So, I will go ahead and do that now.",85,,
750,0.97,7418.043,7420.946,Let's see.,85,,
751,0.97,7420.946,7422.548,Okay.,85,,
752,0.97,7422.548,7432.425,"So, as presiding officer I am announcing this counsel will now have executive session to discuss pending potential or actual litigation.",85,,
753,0.97,7432.425,7439.632,The executive sessions are not--are an opportunity to discuss legal matters.,85,,
754,0.97,7439.632,7447.173,Illegal monitor from the cities office is present to ensure that the Council reserves questions of policy for open sessions.,85,,
755,0.97,7447.173,7454.48,I expect this session will last approximately 60 minutes.,85,,
756,0.97,7454.48,7460.586,That means this executive session will last until 12:35 P.M.,85,,
757,0.97,7460.586,7476.235,If the session is to be extended beyond that time I will announce the extension and the expected duration.,85,,
