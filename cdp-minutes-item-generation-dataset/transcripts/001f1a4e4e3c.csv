30,0.97,211.744,225.258,"The stay home, stay healthy order is through June 17th in the--the city council--through June 17, 2020.",18,,
31,0.97,225.258,239.672,"Just to clarify, he did not extend the stay home and stay healthy order, however, we do have proclamation 20-28.4 which permits the city Council to continue meeting remotely through June 17th.",18,,
32,0.97,239.672,248.514,"And so in order to comply with those recommendations, we'll continue to do so.",18,,
33,0.97,248.514,253.486,"So Councilmembers, the Council rules are silent on participation at committee meetings.",18,,
34,0.97,253.486,259.726,"In order to allow the Council to conduct business, the Council rules will still need to be suspended.",18,,
35,0.97,259.726,266.132,I move to suspend the Council rules to allow the Council to conduct remotely through June 17th.,18,,
36,0.97,266.132,269.936,Hearing and seeing no--is there any objection to that?,18,,

40,0.97,291.19,294.727,"Presentations, I am not aware of any presentations.",18,,
41,0.97,294.727,309.342,"I know that Councilmember Morales has a proclamation that she'd like for us to consider signing on to, but we will go ahead and take that up in the category of other--other business.",18,,
42,0.97,309.342,312.645,So we'll go ahead and move to our approval of the minutes.,18,,
43,0.97,312.645,317.95,"The minutes of the city council meetings--meeting of May 26, 2020 have been reviewed.",18,,

50,0.97,349.348,353.92,"Hearing no objection, the agenda is now adopted.",18,,
51,0.97,353.92,356.756,"So, we're going to move into public comment.",18,,
52,0.97,356.756,360.526,"As you know, on our agenda, we will have two periods of public comment today.",18,,
53,0.97,360.526,376.309,"The first one is our general public comment, and the second will be a public hearing on agenda item one, which is Council bill 119797, related to the land use action around the Mobile home park.",18,,
54,0.97,376.309,395.595,"That bill is cosponsored by Councilmembers Sawant and Juarez, and so the first, again, will be on items on the city council agenda, introduction and referral calendar, or items related to the Council's 2020 work program.",18,,
55,0.97,395.595,401.401,It remains the strong intent to have public comment regularly included in meeting Ageneral Das.,18,,
56,0.97,401.401,416.382,"And of course, we continue to fine tune this process and as we continue to implement and solidify our remote public meeting--public comment processes, we'll continue to provide the public the opportunity to comment.",18,,
57,0.97,416.382,431.264,We do continue to reserve the right to end or eliminate these pub Lib comment periods at any point if we deem the system is being abused or is not suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we are able to conduct necessary business.,18,,
58,0.97,431.264,443.743,"That has thus far not been the case, and I'm glad the public has taken full opportunity and access to use a remote public comment process to participate in our committee meetings.",18,,
59,0.97,443.743,452.018,I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner.,18,,
60,0.97,452.018,455.188,The public comment period is ordinarily 20 minutes.,18,,
61,0.97,455.188,458.991,We have about 37 folks signed up for public comment.,18,,
62,0.97,458.991,470.169,So I'm going to go ahead and just at the top of the hour for sake of efficiency say that we're going to do public comment up to an hour.,18,,
63,0.97,470.169,473.372,So I'm going to allot 60 minutes for public comment.,18,,
64,0.97,473.372,478.311,Ly call on each Speaker by name and in order of which they registered.,18,,
65,0.97,478.311,498.064,"If you are watching or listening and have not yet registered to speak but would like to, you can sign up before the end of the public comment period by going to the Council's Website at Www.Seattle.Gov/Council, council.",18,,
66,0.97,498.064,505.571,And the public comment link is also listed on today's published agenda.,18,,
67,0.97,505.571,512.645,Staff will Unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt of you are Unmuted will be heard by the public Speaker.,18,,
68,0.97,512.645,516.582,And that is the Speaker's Cue that it is their turn to speak.,18,,
69,0.97,516.582,521.387,I ask that each Speaker begin by stating their name and the item that they are addressing.,18,,
70,0.97,521.387,532.798,"As a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction and referral calendar or the Council's 2020 work program.",18,,
71,0.97,532.798,537.737,"The quick hearing on bill 119717, that's the Mobile home park bill.",18,,
72,0.97,537.737,541.574,That will begin after this public comment--general public comment period is open.,18,,
73,0.97,541.574,554.387,So speakers will hear a Chime when ten seconds are left in their allotted two minute time to speak.,18,,
74,0.97,554.387,564.664,"If the speakers don't end their comments at the end of the two minutes provided, then the Speaker's microphone will be automatically muted to allow us to call on the next Speaker.",18,,
75,0.97,564.664,577.243,"Once you've completed your public comment, we ask you Disconnect from the line and if you plan to continue following this meeting, we ask you do so on either channel 21 on your TV or at Seattlechannel.Org.",18,,
76,0.97,577.243,581.18,Or you can call into any of the listening options listed on the agenda.,18,,
77,0.97,581.18,584.517,So we're going to go ahead and now open up the public comment period.,18,,
78,0.97,584.517,587.82,And we'll begin with the first Speaker on the list.,18,,
79,0.97,587.82,592.391,"Again, I've committed to doing 60 minutes.",18,,
80,0.97,592.391,593.693,That'll take us to 3:08 P.M.,18,,
81,0.97,593.693,607.139,And the first Speaker who is with us this Afterno gauge Clark.,18,,
82,0.97,607.139,609.275,"Hi there, how are you?",19,,
83,0.97,609.275,610.109,Good.,20,,
84,0.97,610.109,611.11,"Okay, good.",21,,
85,0.97,611.11,614.213,"My name is gage Clark, I'm a 27-year-old white male.",21,,
86,0.97,614.213,625.124,"I'm a sales representative that works in medical devices, a small business owner, a full-time MBA student and I live with my wife who just graduated law school in Seattle.",21,,
87,0.97,625.124,628.761,I've been an upstanding citizen and in good standing with the law my entire life.,21,,
88,0.97,628.761,635.568,I would like to give the Council a better understanding of what happened at Saturday's protests.,21,,
89,0.97,635.568,639.105,It started out as any other protest I've taken place in.,21,,
90,0.97,639.105,643.009,The only one I've done is the women's March.,21,,
91,0.97,643.009,644.377,Hardly a police officer in sight.,21,,
92,0.97,644.377,650.049,"The group I was with ended up in front of police headquarters, and admittedly, things were tense.",21,,
93,0.97,650.049,656.822,"And people were holding signs chanting a variety of things like black lives matter, don't shoot, I can't breathe.",21,,
94,0.97,656.822,659.925,It was pretty clear that the police were tense.,21,,
95,0.97,659.925,664.33,Their postures were getting more deliberate as the chance continued.,21,,
96,0.97,664.33,672.104,Eventually you started to see things like the police pulling their Batons part way out of their belts and pointing to select members in the crowd.,21,,
97,0.97,672.104,673.305,Some members and I saw a S.W.A.T.,21,,
98,0.97,673.305,675.374,Vehicle at the top of Cherry street.,21,,
99,0.97,675.374,681.514,"And a few of us, less than 25, began walking up the Incline to create a protest line in front of that car.",21,,
100,0.97,681.514,683.949,We had our hands up and were chanting don't shoot.,21,,
101,0.97,683.949,687.253,This was the first time I saw tear gas and flash grenades.,21,,
102,0.97,687.253,688.187,They were being thrown at me.,21,,
103,0.97,688.187,696.595,"When I tried to run back to the safety of numbers, the main Grouch was having tear gas and flash grenades thrown at them too.",21,,
104,0.97,696.595,701.3,"For the next two and a half hours, they were the most Cay Yachtic and scary of my life.",21,,
105,0.97,701.3,703.436,There's an innate conflict of interest here.,21,,
106,0.97,703.436,709.775,"Police can have a vested interest in suppressing free speech, especially free speech that they are the subject of.",21,,
107,0.97,709.775,713.112,This is one of such rare cases.,21,,
108,0.97,713.112,717.383,I blatantly saw police instigate the chaos.,21,,
109,0.97,717.383,722.888,I saw them use Hypermilitarized tactics on the citizens of your city who were trying to protest peacefully.,21,,
110,0.97,722.888,728.594,The protest became violent after the police started using chemical weapons.,21,,
111,0.97,728.594,735.768,I'm extremely disappointed that Mayor disturb can's solution was to add for toxicity.,21,,
112,0.97,735.768,736.502,Having --,21,,
113,0.97,736.502,738.704,"Thank you, gage for calling in this afternoon.",22,,

121,0.97,766.132,779.111,"I'm outraged for Sean Lee, Schar Lena Lyles, Shea Taylor, Alonzo Price-Hold, John T. Williams and others who have been shot and killed by Seattle police officers.",23,,
122,0.97,779.111,787.353,"When black and Brown citizens pay tax dollars for police protection and instead are killed by the police at an alarming and disproportionate rate, you must take action.",23,,
123,0.97,787.353,790.356,We've got to change the system.,23,,
124,0.97,790.356,793.626,This is not public safety.,23,,
125,0.97,793.626,803.469,Victoria is chair for the African-American Adv Council and she raised some good questions on Kuow this morning.,23,,
126,0.97,803.469,807.64,She says she does not feel Seattle's African-American community is being heard.,23,,
127,0.97,807.64,810.776,She asked why can't Seattle step up and speak out?,23,,
128,0.97,810.776,812.444,Get out there on the front lines?,23,,
129,0.97,812.444,817.85,"March with us, pray with us, kneel with us, be like other cities.",23,,
130,0.97,817.85,818.35,I agree wholeheartedly.,23,,
131,0.97,818.35,823.022,Seattle police could have marched with the people as we saw some police do around the country.,23,,
132,0.97,823.022,826.358,I'm disgusted with how several police officers Interacted with our citizens over the weekend.,23,,

134,0.97,829.762,835.167,We saw a young girl sprayed in the face with pepper spray.,23,,
135,0.97,835.167,838.27,We saw peaceful protesters flash banged and all by SPD.,23,,
136,0.97,838.27,843.943,And we saw officers covering their name badges to avoid accountability.,23,,
137,0.97,843.943,859.725,"Moms Demapd action is deeply concerned that while we continue to give a large budget to SPD many Community-Based, violence intervention prevention groups such as community Passageways, Rainier Beach action coalition remain underfunded.",23,,
138,0.97,859.725,868.467,"It's never been more important to ensure these groups get the dollars already promised for 2020, even as budgets are come promised due to the pandemic.",23,,
139,0.97,868.467,872.671,"Not only do they need the money you already allocated to them, they need to expand their work.",23,,
140,0.97,872.671,881.313,We want to see them at the forefront of 2021 budget planning.,23,,

146,0.97,904.47,914.847,-- defines terrorism as the unlawful use of force and violence against persons to intimidate or cause a civilian population to further political or social objectives.,25,,
147,0.97,914.847,919.418,"By this very definition, what the cops did over the weekend was an act of terrorism.",25,,

154,0.97,960.292,962.961,I've been sick for a week and been home.,27,,
155,0.97,962.961,977.609,"And I've been using my credit cards to pay all my bills, and it's essential for the Councilmembers to actually take a hard look at gig workers for not getting paid for sick in this pandemic.",27,,
156,0.97,977.609,978.977,Thank you for your time tonight.,27,,

164,0.97,1019.685,1029.928,"Yet, when our workers may have been exposed to Covid-19, they currently face an impossible choice between putting food on the table and staying home to prevent the spread of the virus.",29,,
165,0.97,1029.928,1036.368,Paid sick and safe days for gig workers will allow them to stop working and seek medical treatment when they need it.,29,,
166,0.97,1036.368,1042.241,They can take time off to care for sick family members or children who are home because schools are closed.,29,,
167,0.97,1042.241,1047.446,"In addition, with more people staying home to stay healthy, the use of delivery Apps have been booming.",29,,
168,0.97,1047.446,1056.288,"However, although gig workers are the ones Shouldering the risk of contracting Covid-19, pay rates actually appear to be decreasing, rather than compensating them for that risk.",29,,
169,0.97,1056.288,1064.63,"Gig workers need to be able to afford medical care if they get sick, but a job can pay as little as $2.",29,,
170,0.97,1064.63,1073.138,"When the crisis has passed, gig workers will need permanent pay standards and protection.",29,,
171,0.97,1073.138,1078.11,These essential front line workers deserve hazard pay now.,29,,

175,0.97,1090.456,1096.728,"Hi, I'm the program director of an advocacy program.",31,,
176,0.97,1096.728,1102.835,I'm Testifying in support of Council bill 119793 to provide sick days for gig workers.,31,,
177,0.97,1102.835,1114.58,"I was a gig worker for eight years after I was laid off from my full-time job during the last recession, and my current job is the first full-time job I've had since then.",31,,
178,0.97,1114.58,1119.551,Many disabled people do gig work because it offers the flexibility we need to work with our disabilities.,31,,
179,0.97,1119.551,1124.69,Sometimes it allows us to avoid the discrimination we face when applying for other jobs.,31,,
180,0.97,1124.69,1126.125,That was my case.,31,,
181,0.97,1126.125,1132.097,"I wasn't out about my low vision, and so potential employees, they couldn't figure out what my deal was.",31,,
182,0.97,1132.097,1136.835,"With gig work, I could prove I could do the work first without them realizing I was disabled.",31,,
183,0.97,1136.835,1141.206,"As a gig worker, the pressure to take on work is constant.",31,,
184,0.97,1141.206,1145.444,My role is never to turn down jobs because you never knew when the next job was going to come.,31,,
185,0.97,1145.444,1148.547,I worked when I was sick.,31,,
186,0.97,1148.547,1150.582,I worked right after my C-Section.,31,,
187,0.97,1150.582,1153.919,"For many, it's the only job market we've had access to.",31,,
188,0.97,1153.919,1161.827,It's critical we start to think big picture about the kinds of policies we need so that gig work can be stable and secure.,31,,
189,0.97,1161.827,1176.441,"Just like generations of workers before us fought with their unions for shorter work days or paid sick and vacation time, for Employer-Provided health care, we need to push for these same policies for the gig economy today.",31,,
190,0.97,1176.441,1176.675,Thans.,31,,
191,0.97,1176.675,1181.013,"Thank you, Anna for calling in today.",32,,

195,0.97,1191.156,1193.659,So I'm hoping to talk about police violence today.,33,,
196,0.97,1193.659,1199.665,And I'm advocating for you to Defund the police by 50%.,33,,
197,0.97,1199.665,1218.684,"I witnessed my friends peacefully protesting and they were Maced directly in the face by the police, pushed back and two were arrested and pushed to the ground with a knee to their back, similar to what happened to George Floyd, the death we were protesting.",33,,
198,0.97,1218.684,1223.555,The police--I did not witness the police making me personally feel safe.,33,,
199,0.97,1223.555,1225.424,They made me feel very unsafe.,33,,
200,0.97,1225.424,1235.167,"Shortly after I arrived, I could hear the flash bangs going off even though I had left with my friends to tend to their wounds from the Mace.",33,,
201,0.97,1235.167,1240.272,I also work in social services and have had to call the police for mental health crises for my clients.,33,,
202,0.97,1240.272,1242.641,I never feel safe calling the police in those cases.,33,,
203,0.97,1242.641,1252.618,"I feel like I have to watch over them to make sure that my client, my black clients R not the next victim of this violence because they experience mental health challenges.",33,,
204,0.97,1252.618,1274.139,"So I'm asking for you to Defund the police by 50% and Redistribute that money into programs that are black led and that are going to observe the community, serve the people of color in Seattle and make sure that mental health services are available for everyone who needs them.",33,,
205,0.97,1274.139,1274.439,Thank you.,33,,
206,0.97,1274.439,1281.446,Thank you for calling in today.,34,,

210,0.97,1288.02,1288.954,I live in district three.,35,,
211,0.97,1288.954,1297.362,"I was--I am also Commenting on police accountability and just listening to the callers that have already called in, I'm grateful for their input.",35,,
212,0.97,1297.362,1300.198,I pretty much agree with what everyone has said.,35,,
213,0.97,1300.198,1304.002,I was at the protest on Saturday on the 30th.,35,,
214,0.97,1304.002,1310.042,"I was in the back, though, trying to social distance.",35,,
215,0.97,1310.042,1318.45,"So I didn't experience the direct police misconduct, but I do have firsthand accounts from Acquaintances who were there further up.",35,,
216,0.97,1318.45,1324.89,"One woman had a flash bomb go off next to her, and her Eardrum was ruptured.",35,,
217,0.97,1324.89,1337.202,"And also when she tried to leave, her and her friend had driven from a ways away, and they were trying to get to their car, but there was no way that the police would let them through to get to their car.",35,,
218,0.97,1337.202,1340.439,"And they asked what they were supposed to do, and there was really no answer.",35,,
219,0.97,1340.439,1347.412,And then also just--I'm deeply concerned with all the tear gas and flash bombs being thrown.,35,,
220,0.97,1347.412,1353.719,I'm concerned about badge numbers being covered up and protesters feeling trapped.,35,,
221,0.97,1353.719,1360.425,"And this Approachability of police officers, I feel that that is escalation instead of De-Escalation.",35,,
222,0.97,1360.425,1368.133,"I think police officers need to be approachable, and they just do not come off that way.",35,,
223,0.97,1368.133,1369.701,So please take this into account.,35,,
224,0.97,1369.701,1378.31,"If we care about the murder of George Floyd, then we also need to start with our local police officers and hold them accountable for every misconduct.",35,,
225,0.97,1378.31,1379.811,Thank you for the time.,35,,
226,0.97,1379.811,1387.152,Thank you for calling in this afternoon.,36,,

230,0.97,1409.007,1423.455,-- companies become greedy and making more money.,37,,
231,0.97,1423.455,1439.805,-- it is easy for them to silence the truth--elected by us.,37,,

233,0.97,1441.606,1445.51,We are very disappointed with the way they treat us.,37,,

247,0.97,1509.14,1518.984,I come to you today to answer a question that many Rideshare providers have to ask--why is sick pay important to me?,39,,
248,0.97,1518.984,1524.723,Sick pay is important because it makes us as Rideshare providers feel valued and appreciated.,39,,
249,0.97,1524.723,1528.994,It helps answer the questions what if I get sick?,39,,
250,0.97,1528.994,1534.9,How will I pay my monthly dues and responsibilities?,39,,
251,0.97,1534.9,1535.734,It helps with overall morale.,39,,
252,0.97,1535.734,1544.376,"In closing, we all want to feel like we matter.",39,,
253,0.97,1544.376,1548.013,"In doing so, passing this sick pay legislation would do so.",39,,
254,0.97,1548.013,1551.082,So I challenge you to ask yourself is equality fair?,39,,
255,0.97,1551.082,1555.12,"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen and have a good day.",39,,

263,0.97,1588.019,1593.458,"While the companies are making more money than ever, it's not being passed down to the people doing the work.",41,,
264,0.97,1593.458,1600.999,"They're getting paid minimum wages, do not have basic protections, and often have to buy their own Ppe and safety supplies.",41,,
265,0.97,1600.999,1608.373,"If anything, pay rates have gone down as so many new workers have been brought on to the Apps.",41,,
266,0.97,1608.373,1612.611,"While customers are tipping generously, the companies are paying less.",41,,
267,0.97,1612.611,1614.546,Today that starts to change.,41,,
268,0.97,1614.546,1621.753,I want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for your leadership during this public health crisis.,41,,

271,0.97,1634.566,1636.167,We hope the idea spreads.,41,,
272,0.97,1636.167,1639.037,"This is a big step forward, but there's work to do.",41,,
273,0.97,1639.037,1646.511,We need hazard pay during the crisis to reflect the risk workers are taking on and the extra expenses they're carrying.,41,,
274,0.97,1646.511,1656.788,"And we can't lose sight of the crisis workers face every day, even before this start, we need long-term protections, including pay standards to guarantee minimum wage and expenses.",41,,

284,0.97,1705.07,1709.441,And I am calling to talk about the tax Amazon initiative.,43,,
285,0.97,1709.441,1723.721,"A number of us here in district one are concerned that it has not been discussed as much as we would like, which means that it's that much further from being passed.",43,,
286,0.97,1723.721,1752.484,"And just going to my own experience as a teacher, and as a special education teacher, and as somebody who's live here for about 30 years, I feel myself becoming kind of a Defact toe social worker, because when I make the contact to my students' families, I am running into people who are in Straits.",43,,

291,0.97,1774.038,1778.309,I've seen my own neighbors pushed out of the neighborhood.,43,,
292,0.97,1778.309,1787.118,We need to have some sort of social housing and we have the most Regressive tax structure that we could have.,43,,
293,0.97,1787.118,1792.857,It's ridiculous to not have big businesses pay tax.,43,,
294,0.97,1792.857,1795.894,Amazon Showboat by making the contributions it makes to Mary's place.,43,,
295,0.97,1795.894,1798.763,"It's good they're doing that, but we need to tax Amazon.",43,,

340,0.97,2125.123,2134.298,"All I ask is for Seattle city Council to stand with gig workers, treat us like true, actual Humes.",49,,
341,0.97,2134.298,2138.703,"Give us sick leave if we're truly essential, so we're not spreading infection.",49,,

358,0.97,2206.237,2211.976,I'm scared I'm going to die because I am my color.,49,,
359,0.97,2211.976,2216.414,"You hear anger in my voice, that is fear.",49,,
360,0.97,2216.414,2228.326,"That's desperation and it's 33 years of being scared, being told that I am a target for my skin color.",49,,

367,0.97,2248.846,2254.619,I'm a delivery driver and Rideshare driver since December 2016.,51,,
368,0.97,2254.619,2258.656,I'm advocating for safety and sick leave for gig workers.,51,,
369,0.97,2258.656,2265.796,"We are advocating for a lot of people who are underprivileged people, people of all races and national origins who do this work.",51,,
370,0.97,2265.796,2273.904,"A lot of people in this industry have dark skin, and one of the biggest issues we face is near need of making a better living.",51,,
371,0.97,2273.904,2278.876,We're doing essential work without any of the protections other workers are afforded.,51,,
372,0.97,2278.876,2284.749,We are taking a risk to go out and work.,51,,
373,0.97,2284.749,2286.25,We don't want to be a servant.,51,,
374,0.97,2286.25,2297.194,"We don't want to go to the restaurant, pick up your food, make sure you have a smile on your face when you open the package and then you don't care about us to give us a nickel tip.",51,,
375,0.97,2297.194,2301.399,Th pay is so low that we have to rely on tips.,51,,
376,0.97,2301.399,2310.174,We have to rely on people's generosity because they're relying on my generosity to bring them food for $2.,51,,
377,0.97,2310.174,2312.81,But not everyone relies on tips equally.,51,,
378,0.97,2312.81,2319.216,I make less in tips because of my race and I'm a male.,51,,
379,0.97,2319.216,2325.89,I have seen customers put their wallet back in their pocket as soon as they see I'm a black male pull up in their driveway.,51,,
380,0.97,2325.89,2329.26,"I'm 66 years old, and I know what I see.",51,,
381,0.97,2329.26,2337.835,Having no legal standards in an industry that is made up of so many workers of color reinforces racial discrimination and disparity in pay.,51,,
382,0.97,2337.835,2340.604,Especially since we know that people tip us less based on our race.,51,,
383,0.97,2340.604,2349.113,"We need to make sure our city is looking out for the people doing this work, that's why we need these emergency protections of sick leave and hazard pay now.",51,,
384,0.97,2349.113,2356.721,"And in the long run, we need--racial disparities and how people are treated.",51,,
385,0.97,2356.721,2362.36,We are advocating for change because we want more from the Billionaires.,51,,
386,0.97,2362.36,2369.033,Thank you for hearing us and standing with workers to move this sick leave policy forward.,51,,

390,0.97,2389.12,2392.723,And I lived in Washington state since 2005.,53,,
391,0.97,2392.723,2400.765,"I have been doing gig work since 2016, during which all of those four years I was trying to finish up a bachelor's degree.",53,,
392,0.97,2400.765,2420.184,"And I am calling in today to help advocate for sick pay because I got into a serious accident the week after I finished by bachelor's degree in 2018, and I was heading towards a different job than gig work, but I still was very thankful hat I had been able to G working.",53,,
393,0.97,2420.184,2422.586,And the accident totalled my car.,53,,

395,0.97,2423.32,2435.299,"And so not only was the dream of all that hard work shot, at least temporarily, but I didn't have a car to work in or drive to any of the medical appointments I now needed to go to.",53,,
396,0.97,2435.299,2444.074,I didn't have money because there wasn't sick leave to pay for Uber and Lyft drives to get to medical points.,53,,
397,0.97,2444.074,2453.684,"I didn't have proper representation, proper ambulance orders at the scene of the accident by Seattle police, so the whole thing put me in a bad situation.",53,,
398,0.97,2453.684,2458.255,My youngest son dropped out of his Online high school to take care of me.,53,,
399,0.97,2458.255,2461.525,The whole thing turned our life upside down.,53,,
400,0.97,2461.525,2465.296,"Had there been sick pay, it could have been very, very different.",53,,
401,0.97,2465.296,2478.008,"You know, seeing this situation now really gives me an appreciation that I get to speak up on something that I never thought I'd have a voice on, because now it's super important for so many people, not just me.",53,,
402,0.97,2478.008,2482.746,"Thank you for calling in, Nancy.",54,,

407,0.97,2526.69,2546.844,"And really, this is basically a waste of your time and--because the land that this mobile home park O initially--let's see here.",55,,
408,0.97,2546.844,2550.247,Zoned as mobile park home only because the ground underneath it is unstable.,55,,
409,0.97,2550.247,2555.252,It's on a landfill and under the landfill is a water table from Howard Lake.,55,,
410,0.97,2555.252,2561.058,"And so it should just remain a mobile home Park, and that's that.",55,,

441,0.97,2718.949,2727.691,"Police chief Carmen best recently said that because of Seattle's initiatives and police reforms, something like what happened to George Floyd wouldn't happen here.",61,,
442,0.97,2727.691,2731.628,We can clearly see that that is flat out wrong.,61,,
443,0.97,2731.628,2733.197,We can't risk anymore lives.,61,,
444,0.97,2733.197,2735.499,Defunding police is the answer.,61,,

462,0.97,2831.195,2842.072,"When the city of Seattle imposes a Curfew and immediately begins arresting its own residents, that Aligns us with a history we don't want to be part of.",63,,
463,0.97,2842.072,2846.677,It Aligns us with the agenda of the Trump regime.,63,,
464,0.97,2846.677,2864.261,"President Trump wants us to stay in line, to lack power an avoid our Dissertation in the public--he wants Seattle to be quiet and obedient to protect his agenda.",63,,
465,0.97,2864.261,2871.168,"The police participated in keeping Seattle quiet and of Bead Yept, and they have for the past several days and years before that.",63,,
466,0.97,2871.168,2871.568,It's unacceptable.,63,,
467,0.97,2871.568,2877.641,"The city council needs to Defund them, and I'm asking you as a nurse to do that.",63,,
468,0.97,2877.641,2884.748,"If we matter so much to the community right now, then listen to us.",63,,
469,0.97,2884.748,2885.048,Thank you.,63,,

474,0.97,2902.065,2911.174,"A lot of people, Y'all are going to investigate the facts, but a lot of people have also been talking about the tone of things.",65,,
475,0.97,2911.174,2920.651,"So when I go and look at Online at law enforcement publications, there's a lot of Glee in violence, there's a lot of photos of people.",65,,
476,0.97,2920.651,2923.153,Their faces smashed in the ground.,65,,
477,0.97,2923.153,2925.422,They take photos to keep of that.,65,,

479,0.97,2926.323,2931.128,"So when we see them Smirking, it's not in our imagination.",65,,
480,0.97,2931.128,2937.668,"There's also the casual thing, just sort of casually Macing people in the face, casually punching them.",65,,
481,0.97,2937.668,2945.108,"So there's Glee, there's the casual, and then the casual extends to Jenny Durkan too, who I request to resign.",65,,
482,0.97,2945.108,2954.451,"She casually brushed off the question of the cops covering their badge numbers, as if it had never occurred to her and was something she didn't know about.",65,,
483,0.97,2954.451,2962.426,"These things are part of what can lead us to the deeper truth, which is cops are inherently a terrible idea.",65,,
484,0.97,2962.426,2970.2,We need to Defund the police and invest this money in something else.,65,,
485,0.97,2970.2,2971.802,This couldn't have made it clearer.,65,,

496,0.97,3004.267,3008.372,We need to prepare for the coming recession as well as the climate crisis.,67,,
497,0.97,3008.372,3012.843,And we can address and support all of these with a small tax on big business.,67,,
498,0.97,3012.843,3029.326,"I know that you guys weren't able to make progress on this tax because you were restricted from doing so during the health emergency, but now that these restrictions are lifted, I just wanted to urge you guys to pass this tax as quickly as possible.",67,,

500,0.97,3039.169,3045.809,But it isn't working for other people who have just as much right to their health and to stability.,67,,

502,0.97,3046.41,3051.782,"It's a progressive state, but we have one of the most Regressive tax systems in the nation.",67,,
503,0.97,3051.782,3058.488,So it's not like these business leaders are facing particular tax burdens at this moment.,67,,
504,0.97,3058.488,3062.426,So passing this tax should be an immediate priority.,67,,
505,0.97,3062.426,3064.528,It's a move to support working people.,67,,

515,0.97,3118.348,3121.051,The community police Commission is missing in action.,69,,
516,0.97,3121.051,3131.428,They spent tens of thousands of dollars in the last few months doing Webinars on Covid.,69,,
517,0.97,3131.428,3135.799,The OPA has now certified over ten police killings.,69,,

523,0.97,3166.229,3171.134,"He was running away from the police, yes he did have a knife, but he was shot five times in the back.",69,,
524,0.97,3171.134,3175.772,So what I'm asking is we can't pretend our way out of this crisis.,69,,
525,0.97,3175.772,3189.719,"Seattle is just as guilty as every other city that has these problems, and I'm begging and pleading the city Council has to take a stronger role in oversight.",69,,

532,0.97,3216.479,3222.152,It's hard to distill all my thoughts and feelings about what happened this weekend into a set of comments.,71,,
533,0.97,3222.152,3225.755,"So instead, I want to start with the forward joke--and that's the Seattle police Department.",71,,
534,0.97,3225.755,3228.391,I live downtown and I like it here.,71,,

539,0.97,3252.349,3261.224,"When called out on the police escalation, the Mayor asked the public--who we would believe, her or our lying eyes?",71,,
540,0.97,3261.224,3270.667,"So after the police turned this peaceful protest into violent ones, they need us to lose control of multiple weapons, recovered by a reporter's security guard.",71,,
541,0.97,3270.667,3278.341,"There's been an epidemic of crime downtown, and the shops that were looted Saturday have been complaining for months about theft, assault and property damage.",71,,
542,0.97,3278.341,3290.053,"I'm heartbroken by what's going on in this city, and I feel like we need the police to play a role downtown, but not like this, not when they're going to antagonize peaceful protesters.",71,,

550,0.97,3320.216,3324.287,I think there are a number of different things we can do to help.,71,,
551,0.97,3324.287,3332.162,I think a number of them are police Union oversight and looking at Data-Driven methods of police reform and seeing what works.,71,,
552,0.97,3332.162,3338.034,"I would love to send you Emails with proposals, but right now I'm frustrated and angry, so thanks for your time.",71,,

557,0.97,3367.497,3384.748,"It's clear, if only from the events of this weekend, that Mayor Durkan and city attorney Holmes are, I'm convinced, willingly deaf to the deaths of African-Americans as well as other people.",73,,
558,0.97,3384.748,3398.027,"-- Mayor and city attorney's destructive attempts to end one hard earned oversight of community members, you each have more--and as individually and as a Council to call attention to this incompetence.",73,,

676,0.97,4120.816,4122.785,So several people have sent Emails to you about this.,106,,
677,0.97,4122.785,4131.56,"So if you have a chance to read them, please do.",106,,

682,0.97,4147.71,4165.294,"Two things happened that made it difficult for us to move forward on getting the things done for the Rezone, more permanent work.",106,,
683,0.97,4165.294,4169.999,And the one was we changed the Broord of directors here.,106,,
684,0.97,4169.999,4174.303,So we had to kind of start over with a new group.,106,,
685,0.97,4174.303,4177.439,"And then, of course, Covid-19 happened.",106,,
686,0.97,4177.439,4184.947,"So because of that, we really weren't able to move fo.",106,,
687,0.97,4184.947,4214.91,Our intention is you pass this extra extension and then--in the next six months that we work with you and the Mayor's office and the city departments to get the reports done that need to be done in order to move this into a more permanent zoning for our mobile home only.,106,,
688,0.97,4214.91,4215.778,"Okay, I guess that's it.",106,,
689,0.97,4215.778,4216.612,Am I --,106,,

705,0.97,4275.804,4282.244,"And let me tell you, the last hour has been Oh so tragic to hear everyone's sadness.",115,,
706,0.97,4282.244,4290.052,"And that's not the reason for this phone call, but my God, everyone is suffering now.",115,,
707,0.97,4290.052,4296.358,And all I want to say is the Mobile home Park is a senior park.,115,,
708,0.97,4296.358,4300.029,And the choice we've got is we bought our homes.,115,,
709,0.97,4300.029,4308.737,"It's the only one really left here, that we're homeowners of our, you know, mobile unit.",115,,
710,0.97,4308.737,4313.742,"And if they kick us out or just, you know, level it, we have no place to go.",115,,
711,0.97,4313.742,4329.124,"There are a lot of people that will add to the homeless population because we're seniors and, come on you guys, don't you have senior parents?",115,,
712,0.97,4329.124,4333.062,Don't you have people that love you?,115,,
713,0.97,4333.062,4342.838,"There's a time that, Yeah, taking care of your Elders should be a good thing, not a bad thing.",115,,
714,0.97,4342.838,4352.081,"And I--my heart's being broken with everything that's going on, as all of yours are.",115,,
715,0.97,4352.081,4358.22,And that's about what I need to say.,115,,
716,0.97,4358.22,4361.09,That let's hope tomorrow's better than the weekend.,115,,
717,0.97,4361.09,4362.558,"All right, I'm done.",115,,
718,0.97,4362.558,4365.394,"Thank you, Dominique for calling in.",116,,
719,0.97,4365.394,4371.5,We appreciate you taking the time to do it.,116,,
720,0.97,4371.5,4372.601,We have Stuart Duckworth listed.,116,,
721,0.97,4372.601,4382.478,"I know we heard from him during the general comment period, but if Stuart is still on the line, we would be happy to hear from him.",116,,
722,0.97,4382.478,4382.945,"Well, hello again.",117,,
723,0.97,4382.945,4384.78,"Yes, I'm still on the line.",117,,
724,0.97,4384.78,4390.586,And I agree with Dominique about all the other people that have talked.,117,,
725,0.97,4390.586,4395.457,This is an amazing situation that we have out there.,117,,
726,0.97,4395.457,4411.073,"However, I'm here just to support the extension of the Mobile home park and actually we should Ma permanent because this has always been a mobile home park.",117,,
727,0.97,4411.073,4429.458,"They tried to put development in here because it's a fairly large piece of property, but it is built on a garbage dump from the late '50S, or middle '50S, and underneath the garbage dump is the water runoff from Howard Lake.",117,,
728,0.97,4429.458,4430.993,So this is really unstable ground.,117,,
729,0.97,4430.993,4436.999,"Mobile home Park is basically all that it's really good for, or manufactured home parks.",117,,
730,0.97,4436.999,4437.366,We have homes.,117,,
731,0.97,4437.366,4440.569,We have a couple of those in here too.,117,,
732,0.97,4440.569,4449.745,So we just need to get a vote to make this a permanent seniors mobile home park.,117,,
733,0.97,4449.745,4454.149,"Thank you very much, and have a great rest of your day.",117,,
734,0.97,4454.149,4462.157,"Thank you, Stuart, for calling in today.",118,,
735,0.97,4462.157,4467.229,That concludes public Commenters that I have formally signed up for today here.,118,,
736,0.97,4467.229,4478.106,So we will go ahead and close out the public hearing on Council bill 119797 and we will now proceed with a vote on the bill.,118,,
737,0.97,4478.106,4487.216,So I will move to pass Council bill 119797.,118,,
738,0.97,4487.216,4489.084,Is there a second?,118,,
739,0.97,4489.084,4489.651,Second.,119,,
740,0.97,4489.651,4490.319,Second.,120,,
741,0.97,4490.319,4491.119,Thank you so much.,121,,
742,0.97,4491.119,4497.559,"Councilmember Sawant, I saw your lips move, but I didn't hear anything, so I wanted to have a little pause there.",121,,
743,0.97,4497.559,4498.66,Thank you.,121,,
744,0.97,4498.66,4501.53,It's been moved and Seconded to pass the bill.,121,,
745,0.97,4501.53,4503.565,Councilmember Sawant is lead sponsor of the bill.,121,,
746,0.97,4503.565,4512.941,I'd like to recognize you in order for you to address this item in further detail.,121,,
747,0.97,4512.941,4514.076,"Thank you, president Gonzalez.",122,,
748,0.97,4514.076,4515.978,I don't plan to have any more points.,122,,
749,0.97,4515.978,4524.52,I think the points have been made by the residents themselves about why it's so important we maintain their housing.,122,,
750,0.97,4524.52,4532.094,"And as they highlighted, they are senior members of our society, and we should be Prioritizing protecting their housing.",122,,
751,0.97,4532.094,4532.427,Thank you.,122,,
752,0.97,4532.427,4534.93,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",123,,
753,0.97,4534.93,4539.167,Are there any other comments on the bill?,123,,
754,0.97,4539.167,4547.442,"Okay, I see Councilmember Pedersen followed by Councilmember Mosqueda and then Councilmember Strauss.",123,,
755,0.97,4547.442,4548.944,"Councilmember Pedersen, you are recognized, please.",123,,
756,0.97,4548.944,4549.444,Thank you.,124,,
757,0.97,4549.444,4557.819,"Wanted to thank the resident that is called in today, and also to thank Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Juarez for their leadership on this.",124,,
758,0.97,4557.819,4564.293,"This is a great example of preserving affordable housing that we already have, preventing homelessness.",124,,
759,0.97,4564.293,4567.93,I want to thank them for their leadership on this.,124,,
760,0.97,4567.93,4570.098,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",125,,
761,0.97,4570.098,4573.635,We will now hear from Councilmember Mosqueda and then Councilmember Strauss.,125,,
762,0.97,4573.635,4574.436,"Thank you, Madame President.",126,,
763,0.97,4574.436,4595.023,"Just a quick question for the sponsors, if I might, given the delay in the initial plan to have a more concrete strategy K you talk a little bit more if it's appropriate, Madame President, if it's appropriate for the sponsors to do so, can you talk more about what your hope is at the end of six months?",126,,
764,0.97,4595.023,4603.799,"I know we want folks to work with Stci, but are there concrete plans we think will come to fruition at the end of these six months?",126,,
765,0.97,4603.799,4606.368,Who wants to take that?,127,,
766,0.97,4606.368,4611.873,Does Councilmember Sawant or Juarez want to take that up?,127,,
767,0.97,4611.873,4613.875,I can.,128,,
768,0.97,4613.875,4615.043,Councilmember Juarez.,129,,
769,0.97,4615.043,4617.613,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",130,,
770,0.97,4617.613,4633.195,"As you know, we've been working on this for--Councilmember Sawant and I, when Councilmember Johnson was here as well, and the short answer is we would like to see a legislative fix.",130,,
771,0.97,4633.195,4637.499,We carve out a particular zoned area for these manufactured mobile home parks.,130,,
772,0.97,4637.499,4646.908,"I think a lot of people think these are just mobile homes, but these are actually manufactured homes with a concrete foundation.",130,,
773,0.97,4646.908,4651.046,"People have lived there for many, many, many years.",130,,
774,0.97,4651.046,4657.152,"And as Councilmember Sawant shared, we have a lot of Elders, retirees.",130,,
775,0.97,4657.152,4661.49,We have a lot of--just have a lot of older generation living there.,130,,
776,0.97,4661.49,4669.398,We've been there at least three times and have met with the different leadership at both areas.,130,,
777,0.97,4669.398,4674.603,"So the end game is that we carve out some legislation, that we make it permanent.",130,,
778,0.97,4674.603,4685.847,And we looked at other zoning and how other cities did it.,130,,
779,0.97,4685.847,4687.015,"Up in Snohomish County, Thurston County.",130,,
780,0.97,4687.015,4690.252,That's what success should look like hopefully.,130,,
781,0.97,4690.252,4693.021,So thank you for that question.,130,,
782,0.97,4693.021,4693.255,Okay.,131,,
783,0.97,4693.255,4696.925,"Councilmember Sawant, did you want to respond to that as well?",131,,
784,0.97,4696.925,4701.43,"Okay, we'll do that and then hear from Councilmember Strauss.",131,,
785,0.97,4701.43,4701.863,Councilmember Sawant,131,,
786,0.97,4701.863,4702.197,Thank you.,132,,
787,0.97,4702.197,4711.707,"As Councilmember Juarez mentioned, Yeah, there are other cities that have created that permanent mobile home park zoning designation.",132,,
788,0.97,4711.707,4719.247,"And so there's nothing new or strange or difficult about this, but Seattle does not happen to have that zoning type so far.",132,,
789,0.97,4719.247,4733.762,"So in order to make that happen and to make that zoning or type permanent, the Department would need to carry out an analysis, a state Environmental protection act analysis.",132,,
790,0.97,4733.762,4741.169,"It should be fairly routine work, but for whatever reason that the Mayor's office should be answering to, they have not.",132,,
791,0.97,4741.169,4752.114,"But if they did carry that out, which they should be doing, because we cannot be indefinitely extending the temporary designation, they should carry that out.",132,,
792,0.97,4752.114,4754.816,"Once they do that, the Council can pass a similar bill.",132,,
793,0.97,4754.816,4760.255,That designation would be permanent and not just for six months only.,132,,
794,0.97,4760.255,4776.638,"And so I mean, in terms of Councilmember Mosqueda's question, concretely, it comes down to the Councilmembers putting pressure on the Mayor to not postpone this and just do it.",132,,
795,0.97,4776.638,4783.445,"As far as I understand, from a technical standpoint, there are no obstacles to make it permanent.",132,,
796,0.97,4783.445,4788.116,"Thank you, I thought that clarification would be helpful as we think about what happens at the end of six months.",133,,
797,0.97,4788.116,4793.455,So thank you both to the prime sponsors and happy to support today.,133,,
798,0.97,4793.455,4794.556,Councilmember Strauss?,134,,
799,0.97,4794.556,4796.391,"Yeah, thank you, Council President.",135,,
800,0.97,4796.391,4797.626,Thank you Councilmembers for sponsoring this bill.,135,,
801,0.97,4797.626,4813.175,It is something that I would like to engage with you on for a permanent fix before six months is up because we know that a permanent piece of legislation will stop us from having to renew every six months.,135,,
802,0.97,4813.175,4824.553,"My grandmother lived in a manufactured home Park for seniors, and I understand that--I understand that the ground that you keep your home on is not necessarily the ground that you own.",135,,
803,0.97,4824.553,4832.928,And it's important for us to be able to provide this affordable housing and ensure that it remains stable.,135,,
804,0.97,4832.928,4838.867,So I'd love to work with you on making this permanent fix.,135,,
805,0.97,4838.867,4840.268,Thank you.,135,,
806,0.97,4840.268,4843.171,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",136,,
807,0.97,4843.171,4848.91,Any other comments or questions for my colleagues?,136,,
808,0.97,4848.91,4849.945,I'm not seeing any.,136,,
809,0.97,4849.945,4853.114,I think I share the same interest as many of you.,136,,
810,0.97,4853.114,4861.456,"I think it might be the third or fourth time I'm being asked to vote, third time that we're being asked to vote on this issue.",136,,
811,0.97,4861.456,4875.036,"You know, it would be really nice to be able to just have the substance and the actual leg work done and completed by the executives so that we can move on from this issue.",136,,
812,0.97,4875.036,4879.441,It is really frustrating that that has not happened.,136,,
813,0.97,4879.441,4900.061,So hopefully we will be able to encourage the Mayor's office and the Stci to actually just do the analysis and allow for us to have some level of certainty as it relates to this particular issue.,136,,
814,0.97,4900.061,4915.41,"So looking forward to ongoing leadership from Councilmember Juarez and Sawant in that space, and of course, from our land use chair, Councilmember Strauss, to be able to figure out what the path forward is to facilitate the execution of the work that needs to happen.",136,,
815,0.97,4915.41,4919.648,So I definitely plan to support this bill.,136,,
816,0.97,4919.648,4920.081,Okay.,136,,
817,0.97,4920.081,4923.418,Looks like folks don't have anymore questions or comments.,136,,
818,0.97,4923.418,4932.727,I do want to offer the sponsors an opportunity to close out the conversation if they have anything else that they'd like to add.,136,,
819,0.97,4932.727,4932.927,No.,137,,
820,0.97,4932.927,4933.261,All right.,138,,
821,0.97,4933.261,4936.264,Looks like nothing else to add here.,138,,
822,0.97,4936.264,4947.709,So I would ask that the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill.,138,,
823,0.97,4947.709,4950.178,Moralless?,139,,
824,0.97,4950.178,4950.645,Aye.,140,,
825,0.97,4950.645,4953.281,Mosqueda?,141,,

857,0.97,5049.177,5051.079,It's been moved.,164,,

863,0.97,5064.025,5068.863,And thanks to my Council colleagues for all of your engagement on this issue.,167,,
864,0.97,5068.863,5082.811,"As you know, paid sick and safe leave is something the city of Seattle have been proud to have implemented in 2012 and paid sick and safe leave as we know, and as you talked about during the initial passage, is not just about the workers it protects.",167,,
865,0.97,5082.811,5083.244,So that's critical.,167,,
866,0.97,5083.244,5086.481,It's about protecting the community at large.,167,,
867,0.97,5086.481,5095.023,"When workers go to work sick, they interact with other people, they take longer to recover, they have the potential to infect their coworkers and members of the public.",167,,
868,0.97,5095.023,5105.767,"And when workers don't have the ability to take time off for safe leave, due to domestic violence, they are unable to get the support and resources they need to be safe.",167,,
869,0.97,5105.767,5125.587,"It's in light of the importance of paid sick and safe leave for both the workers and the community at large that we wanted to make sure this vital labor standards protection was extended to gig workers, especially in light of the critical work they are doing right now to serve our community.",167,,
870,0.97,5125.587,5126.488,These are our friends.,167,,
871,0.97,5126.488,5127.522,These are our neighbors.,167,,
872,0.97,5127.522,5137.699,"These are our family members, and they deserve the same protections every other worker needs under paid sick and safe lead.",167,,
873,0.97,5137.699,5162.69,"In recognition of the benefits that paid sick and safe leave have, we wanted to make sure that we built on the good work that you all passed in 2012 for the Councilmembers who were here then, and also to make sure that we extended the protections that we all passed as a state when we voted to implement initiative 1433 that I had the pleasure of partially leading in 2016.",167,,
874,0.97,5162.69,5163.725,We're proud of these protections.,167,,
875,0.97,5163.725,5169.43,We're proud that they have been a leading example for other States and cities across the country.,167,,
876,0.97,5169.43,5179.641,But we also recognize that these protections largely only apply to traditional W2 employees.,167,,
877,0.97,5179.641,5182.71,That's why it's important.,167,,
878,0.97,5182.71,5186.347,Gig work has dramatically increased in the past decade.,167,,
879,0.97,5186.347,5190.552,We're roughly around one sixth of workers across the country are doing gig work.,167,,
880,0.97,5190.552,5197.025,"This is not just about the gig economy, quote, Unquote, this is just about the economy at this point.",167,,
881,0.97,5197.025,5204.966,"Workers are being left out who are essential components of our economy, and they don't have paid sick and safe leave.",167,,
882,0.97,5204.966,5219.347,"Especially now during the Coronavirus, given the amount of work that is happening right now from workers who are delivering food, who are delivering groceries, who are driving people to essential appointments across our city, we need to make sure that their needs are met.",167,,
883,0.97,5219.347,5233.228,"And keeping them safe, allowing them to be protected from Getling sick, and also making sure that if they get sick, or they need a safe day, they have the protections they need for their day-to-day protection so they can get paid.",167,,
884,0.97,5233.228,5238.533,This is about interacting with members of our public.,167,,
885,0.97,5238.533,5242.37,Many of these workers have countless contacts with individuals throughout our community.,167,,
886,0.97,5242.37,5256.417,"As you heard from the folks who testified today, they go right up to the doors of our neighbors, right up to the doors of our house to deliver groceries, to deliver food and to provide folks with the essential services that they need.",167,,
887,0.97,5256.417,5265.159,It is critical that they have protections if they are sick or need to take a day off to take care of their family members.,167,,
888,0.97,5265.159,5268.529,Many platforms we have worked with over the last two plus months.,167,,
889,0.97,5268.529,5274.302,At this point we're on to ten weeks of engagement with Stakeholders.,167,,
890,0.97,5274.302,5277.972,Many platforms have stated they're providing sick leave for their workers.,167,,
891,0.97,5277.972,5283.778,But we've heard from many workers that they don't have access to adequate leave or it's hard to access the policies offered.,167,,
892,0.97,5283.778,5300.128,"We've been working to make sure that this legislation is in the right form to protect the workers and make sure that it's Implementable, to make sure that the actions are receivable from the workers so that when we pass the law, the workers can actually get to take advantage of sick and safe leave when they need it.",167,,
893,0.97,5300.128,5308.536,We've been in coordination with a number of partners to get this right and many of those partners include you on city council for all of your feedback over the last two weeks.,167,,
894,0.97,5308.536,5325.453,"Thanks so much to a few folks and then I'll stop and save a few thank Yous for the end, Council President, but I want to say thank you to the labor unions and advocates, including working Washington, Mlk labor for helping us develop this legislation.",167,,
895,0.97,5325.453,5341.969,"Thank you to the platforms we have briefed and sometimes heard feedback and incorporated that Teedback from entities like Postmates, Doordash, Uber eats, Uber, Lyft, Instacart and the Seattle Rideshare Association and drive forward.",167,,
896,0.97,5341.969,5357.518,"Thank you to our friends at the National employment law project, the center for popular democracy, and the center for law and social policy at the national level for helping us learn from policies across the country.",167,,
897,0.97,5357.518,5366.227,And an Email from Jasmine at the office of labor standards who provided us with some feedback earlier today and over the last few weeks.,167,,
898,0.97,5366.227,5370.565,They have been very engaged with us.,167,,
899,0.97,5370.565,5375.47,"Also, folks like Kareem and Janee from the office of labor standards.",167,,
900,0.97,5375.47,5376.504,Kylie and Anthony from the Mayor's office.,167,,
901,0.97,5376.504,5385.38,"They have been tremendous to work with, and we're happy that this legislation is passing, hopefully, with your support today.",167,,
902,0.97,5385.38,5396.924,"Madame chair, I'll save my thank Yous for Carina bull from central staff for after comments, because I think they deserve a few more minutes.",167,,
903,0.97,5396.924,5399.694,This legislation is stronger because of your input.,167,,
904,0.97,5399.694,5409.27,"I think we have a lot to be proud of here, even though we recognize this is the first of many policies that these workers need to be protected.",167,,
905,0.97,5409.27,5410.304,Thank you.,168,,
906,0.97,5410.304,5411.873,Councilmember Mosqueda for those remarks.,168,,
907,0.97,5411.873,5423.584,"Colleagues this morning at Council briefing, of course, we discussed we had Carina bull join us for a substantive conversation and briefing and update on what was included in the substitute bill.",168,,
908,0.97,5423.584,5426.721,I think we're all familiar with that.,168,,
909,0.97,5426.721,5432.894,So at this point we are voting first on the substitution.,168,,
910,0.97,5432.894,5440.435,And then we're going to have a second motion where we will vote on the bill as substituted.,168,,
911,0.97,5440.435,5459.821,"So I would--if you have substantive comments now on the substituted bill on sort of the underlying policy, I'd ask for you to save those until the second motion so that we can go ahead and get the substitution in front of us to allow for that conversation to move forward.",168,,
912,0.97,5459.821,5474.602,So are there any comments for the sponsor or questions for the sponsor on what's included in the substitute bill before we vote on putting the substitute before us?,168,,
913,0.97,5474.602,5474.802,Okay.,168,,
914,0.97,5474.802,5488.616,"Hearing and seeing none, are there--I will ask the clerk to please call the roll on the adoption of the substitute.",168,,

918,0.97,5495.156,5498.526,I think I froze up.,172,,

920,0.97,5499.06,5499.427,My apologies.,172,,
921,0.97,5499.427,5500.461,"It's okay, totally fine.",173,,
922,0.97,5500.461,5503.397,This is the nature of technology in these remote settings.,173,,
923,0.97,5503.397,5507.568,So what we are voting on now is not the substantive bill.,173,,
924,0.97,5507.568,5515.176,We are voting on putting forward in front of us the substitute version of the bill.,173,,
925,0.97,5515.176,5529.824,We will then entertain a motion to adopt this substitute version and then hear comments again.,173,,
926,0.97,5529.824,5535.63,"Does that answer your question, Councilmember Morales?",173,,
927,0.97,5535.63,5542.87,We may have lost Councilmember Morales.,173,,
928,0.97,5542.87,5553.114,"Okay, Madame clerk, I'm going to ask you to call the roll on the bill.",173,,
929,0.97,5553.114,5562.857,We might have to circle back to Councilmember Morales.,173,,

961,0.97,5660.521,5668.195,"Gig workers deliver groceries, drive for Uber and Lyft and do many, many other jobs essential to our society.",193,,
962,0.97,5668.195,5676.537,"These are jobs like any other, except they are marked with a legal fiction that they are one person small businesses instead of employees of a corporation.",193,,
963,0.97,5676.537,5693.187,"The result of this legal fiction is that workers are suddenly no longer protected by labor laws and the bosses do not have to pay the employer's share of social security taxes, and the workers are denied their rights to organize into a Union to collectively bargain for a fair contract with their boss.",193,,
964,0.97,5693.187,5704.031,"This is totally unjust and it's a clear example of how, under cap limb, the working class must continually organize and struggle to avoid falling farther and farther behind.",193,,
965,0.97,5704.031,5720.081,"We should remember that 100 years ago, over 100 years ago, no workers could legally form unions in this country, but courageously, they did anyway, often defending picket lines against physical attack and threat to their very lives.",193,,
966,0.97,5720.081,5728.756,"In the 1920s, the U.S. military was deployed to bomb the picket lines of striking miners.",193,,

968,0.97,5739.467,5743.404,But those labor--those protections were won through labor struggles.,193,,
969,0.97,5743.404,5747.141,The right to organize was won through a struggle.,193,,
970,0.97,5747.141,5760.721,Big business has been attempting to claw back every gain that workers fought for and won while inequality has Ballooned as we know and an estimated one out of every five workers in the U.S.,193,,

973,0.97,5773.167,5782.943,"Ultimately, gig workers will need to Unionize with or without the legal permission to do so, because we only have the power in the workplace when we get organized to fight for it.",193,,

975,0.97,5791.819,5793.554,This is extremely important.,193,,
976,0.97,5793.554,5804.231,"Finally, I would raise the caution around enforcement that I had spoken to when we had this discussion and Council briefing when we first discussed it.",193,,
977,0.97,5804.231,5811.972,Seattle's office of labor standards is empowered to enforce these worker's right because so many big businesses engage in wage theft.,193,,
978,0.97,5811.972,5812.84,There's a serious backlog.,193,,
979,0.97,5812.84,5816.277,"They do excellent work, but they don't have enough resources.",193,,

981,0.97,5824.451,5829.156,We have seen how ruthless corporations can be disregarding worker's rights.,193,,
982,0.97,5829.156,5837.298,The Office of labor standards is currently Understaffed.,193,,
983,0.97,5837.298,5843.437,"The Mayor has a hiring freeze, claiming there's not the bucket because of the Covid-Related shortfalls.",193,,

985,0.97,5845.272,5866.293,"If Mayor Durkan and the city council were willing to tax big business and raise progressive revenues, we could have the resources to stop the authority in order to fully function in protecting worker's rights.",193,,

987,0.97,5879.039,5882.776,Gig workers deserve to be protected with paid sick and safe time rights.,193,,
988,0.97,5882.776,5903.03,"It's important to support this legislation today, but we also need to push back and refuse to accept austerity that is coming down the pipes.",193,,

990,0.97,5903.297,5905.266,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",194,,

993,0.97,5912.006,5918.579,"It goes without saying, and I'll say it at the top, that I will be voting for this legislation.",195,,
994,0.97,5918.579,5927.354,I just wanted to briefly do a Shout-Out to Dan for his reporting --,195,,
995,0.97,5927.354,5929.823,"Hello, don, this is Lisa.",196,,
996,0.97,5929.823,5930.891,Hold on a minute.,197,,
997,0.97,5930.891,5931.158,Everybody.,197,,
998,0.97,5931.158,5940.734,I should never underestimate their ability to go on and on --,198,,
999,0.97,5940.734,5943.57,Councilmember Herbold --,199,,
1000,0.97,5943.57,5943.804,Okay.,200,,
1001,0.97,5943.804,5944.038,Got it.,200,,
1002,0.97,5944.038,5946.774,We can't hear your personal conversation.,200,,
1003,0.97,5946.774,5949.076,"Okay, Councilmember Lewis.",201,,
1004,0.97,5949.076,5954.782,Let me regain my composure a little bit here.,202,,
1005,0.97,5954.782,5968.829,I want to do a Shout-Out to Dan Beekman for his reporting this weekend which made some points that I just wanted to highlight and that I think are really Pres Yent.,202,,
1006,0.97,5968.829,5984.511,"He interviewed a driver named Daisy Torrez who, before driving for one of these Gig-Based platforms, had worked in a hotel and had been an employee.",202,,
1007,0.97,5984.511,5990.317,"And as such, was entitled to paid sick and safe leave.",202,,
1008,0.97,5990.317,5998.225,He interviewed a gentleman named Zach who was driving for an App who prior to Covid worked at a car dealership.,202,,
1009,0.97,5998.225,6004.398,And in that position would have been entitled to paid sick and safe leave.,202,,
1010,0.97,6004.398,6059.286,"I bring that up because I think it is a horrible harbinger of things to Compost-Covid that the openings and opportunities that are thriving for people who have fallen off in the economy that existed Pre-Covid who are already in positions where earnings and benefits were not keeping pace with the rising cost of living are now sustaining themselves economically by working for these Apps that do not have these benefits that all of us have taken for granted in the normal economy over the last decade as folks have fought for and successfully won, including many of the folks on this Council, including paid sick and safe leave, in some cases nationally mandated vacation time.",202,,
1011,0.97,6059.286,6067.161,"And it's just critical that legislation like this--I'm so grateful for your leadership on this, Councilmember Mosqueda.",202,,
1012,0.97,6067.161,6068.929,This is a massive gap in this economy.,202,,
1013,0.97,6068.929,6103.764,"And every time we have one of these downturns as we did in the '90, 2010, 2011 downturn, there's got to be very conscious work on the part of leaders at all level of government to work really hard to try to make sure that inequities that come in during a desperate time in the economy taking a hit don't get entrenched and solidified and become a new normal that changed what the economy on the other side of the recovery looks like.",202,,
1014,0.97,6103.764,6105.265,"You know, I've heard stories.",202,,
1015,0.97,6105.265,6107.267,I cannot speak to them personally.,202,,
1016,0.97,6107.267,6111.772,"There used to be paid Internships, for example, in the work force.",202,,
1017,0.97,6111.772,6122.449,Or I've heard about mandatory overtime or defined benefit pensions that existed during the period of middle class growth that Councilmember Sawant alluded to.,202,,
1018,0.97,6122.449,6134.895,"We need to really make sure that paid sick and safe leave through this Ledgelation, but also more broadly, is is a fundamental part of our economy on the other side of Covid, and that it is during Covid as well.",202,,
1019,0.97,6134.895,6141.768,"I will be voting for this, and I really appreciate your leadership, Councilmember Mosqueda.",202,,
1020,0.97,6141.768,6143.904,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",203,,
1021,0.97,6143.904,6145.772,"Next up, we'll hear from Councilmember Pedersen.",203,,
1022,0.97,6145.772,6153.313,"And if any of my other colleagues wish to make comments, please do let me know.",203,,
1023,0.97,6153.313,6155.582,"Councilmember Pedersen, the floor is yours.",203,,
1024,0.97,6155.582,6156.717,Thank you.,204,,
1025,0.97,6156.717,6163.09,I wanted to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for generously giving us more time to review this legislation.,204,,
1026,0.97,6163.09,6163.59,That was very helpful.,204,,
1027,0.97,6163.59,6169.897,I know that your city council staff and our central staff have worked really hard on this.,204,,
1028,0.97,6169.897,6182.276,I also appreciate your working with the executive on just how to practically implement the legislation and also for reaching out to those in the private sector who would be impacted by the legislation.,204,,
1029,0.97,6182.276,6187.147,Also wanted to shout out to working Washington for their advocacy for this legislation so.,204,,
1030,0.97,6187.147,6191.952,I will be voting for the legislation.,204,,
1031,0.97,6191.952,6194.555,Just wanted to thank Councilmember Mosqueda.,204,,
1032,0.97,6194.555,6194.821,Thank you.,204,,
1033,0.97,6194.821,6202.095,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Pedersen.",205,,
1034,0.97,6202.095,6205.933,"Colleagues, any other comments on the bill?",205,,
1035,0.97,6205.933,6206.133,Okay.,205,,
1036,0.97,6206.133,6209.736,"I'm not--Oh, you will get the last word.",205,,
1037,0.97,6209.736,6223.216,Any other of my colleagues want to give any comments on the bill before we hand it over to Councilmember Mosqueda to close us out?,205,,
1038,0.97,6223.216,6223.717,Councilmember Strauss?,205,,
1039,0.97,6223.717,6226.353,Same thing to everyone for this important legislation.,206,,
1040,0.97,6226.353,6227.521,Thank you so much.,207,,
1041,0.97,6227.521,6230.19,I also want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for her work on this.,207,,
1042,0.97,6230.19,6234.328,I know she's been working on it for quite some time.,207,,
1043,0.97,6234.328,6258.418,"Obviously, such common sense legislation that during a period of time where there is a high level of, you know, high level of risk to exposure to a highly infectious disease that we would provide this coverage to this sector of workers is just common sense not just for the health and safety of the workers but also for the people they interact with as sort of a Connecter of services.",207,,
1044,0.97,6258.418,6261.955,So really want to appreciate Councilmember Mosqueda's efforts on this.,207,,
1045,0.97,6261.955,6271.164,Absolutely agree there's a lot more work we need to do in this space and look forward to an opportunity to finally be able to engage in that body of work in the coming months.,207,,
1046,0.97,6271.164,6275.702,"So with that being said, we're going to go ahead and move forward here.",207,,
1047,0.97,6275.702,6279.74,There appear to be no more comments or debate on this.,207,,
1048,0.97,6279.74,6283.277,So I'm going to go ahead and ask Councilmember Mosqueda to close us out.,207,,
1049,0.97,6283.277,6285.812,And then we'll be able to call the roll on the bill.,207,,
1050,0.97,6285.812,6288.649,"Thank you so much, Council President.",208,,
1051,0.97,6288.649,6295.389,And thanks to all of our Council colleagues for your comments on the paid sick and safe leave ordinance for gig workers.,208,,
1052,0.97,6295.389,6297.357,"As the Council President said, it is common sense.",208,,
1053,0.97,6297.357,6312.305,"And even though it makes sense to give workers sick days during a global pandemic, you can imagine there was a lot of complex policy conversations that went into making sure that this policy was going to be actionable and that people would receive these benefits.",208,,
1054,0.97,6312.305,6319.68,And the two people that I want to thank again are Carina bull from central staff and the chief of staff in my office.,208,,
1055,0.97,6319.68,6324.318,Those are the folks that I'm going to be passing along this thank you to.,208,,
1056,0.97,6324.318,6337.297,I know they're probably watching with great anticipation as this labor of love over the last ten weeks looks to be crossing the finish line.,208,,
1057,0.97,6337.297,6351.812,Her energy and her knowledge and her willingness to think of creative solutions and doing it all with incredible patience and grace as you saw this morning as she presented to our Council colleagues.,208,,
1058,0.97,6351.812,6363.223,"And for her endless hours, Huvens of calls with Stakeholders, multiple meetings throughout both days and nights and weekends to make sure that voices were heard, ideas were incorporated and that the important nuances were worked out.",208,,
1059,0.97,6363.223,6366.193,This is a really critical policy.,208,,
1060,0.97,6366.193,6388.715,"And I think it'll have lasting impacts for both the workers and the protection of all of our health in the upcoming months slash years until we can get both a vaccine for Covid, but also the broader protections every gig worker needs to have.",208,,
1061,0.97,6388.715,6393.32,Wanting to look to continue to strengthen the protections for those workers as well.,208,,
1062,0.97,6393.32,6399.826,"I do want to thank, as you've heard over the last three or four weeks, folks have been writing in, calling.",208,,
1063,0.97,6399.826,6414.741,"The folks who you heard testify today, people in the Beekman article and others, these are the workers who themselves have had to not only figure out how to sustain themselves in this crisis but really have put in a ton of work to crafting this policy with us.",208,,
1064,0.97,6414.741,6425.786,So thank you to the workers impacted by this legislation who've been at the table to help craft this basic set of protections to provide a floor so that every worker can have access to sick leave.,208,,
1065,0.97,6425.786,6431.057,This is an incredible win for those workers and for the city as a whole.,208,,
1066,0.97,6431.057,6436.763,The public comment from today's workers and over the last few weeks have really spoken for themselves.,208,,
1067,0.97,6436.763,6444.771,"You all had heard these stories, but I want to lift up a few comments we heard today and then from last week.",208,,
1068,0.97,6444.771,6452.412,What you heard from Jason today was a sentence that really Resonated that I think we should just spend another second to reflect on.,208,,
1069,0.97,6452.412,6457.684,He said don't call me essential and then not pay me like I'm essential.,208,,
1070,0.97,6457.684,6461.188,"Don't call me a hero, treat me like I'm human.",208,,
1071,0.97,6461.188,6472.666,"He was followed by Mr. Thomas who talked about how critical it is for us to make sure that folks actually have the safe leave that they need, the sick leave that they need, to make sure they haven't been left behind.",208,,
1072,0.97,6472.666,6484.144,"And as he goes to the door, he sees people put their Wallets away because of inherent or Biassed racism that continues to perpetuate in our community.",208,,
1073,0.97,6484.144,6491.952,It should go stated explicitly that the vast majority of workers that we're talking about protecting today are black and Brown workers.,208,,
1074,0.97,6491.952,6498.758,And the vast number of people that have been left out of State and Federal policy in terms of labor protections are black and Brown workers.,208,,
1075,0.97,6498.758,6502.829,And that was true when we passed the domestic workers bill of rights last year.,208,,
1076,0.97,6502.829,6509.903,"Thanks again to the Councilmembers who supported that legislation and that, you know, we made tremendous strides across the nation in passing that.",208,,
1077,0.97,6509.903,6514.674,It's because they were explicitly left out of the Federal protections at the national level.,208,,
1078,0.97,6514.674,6516.71,And we took the action to protect them.,208,,
1079,0.97,6516.71,6541.234,"And today, yet again, we're standing up, especially for those who've been intentionally left out of labor protections in the past to make sure that our vulnerable workers, workers who are now calling essential, have these explicit protections as critical component of our economy and making sure that they have the safety that they need during the time of the pandemic and recognizing that these are mostly black and Brown workers.",208,,
1080,0.97,6541.234,6547.607,"And then Lastly, I want to leave you with the comments I shared from Carmen, who is a Grubhub driver.",208,,
1081,0.97,6547.607,6556.049,"She says now that people are hungry and hiding in their homes from the virus, I am suddenly essential.",208,,
1082,0.97,6556.049,6567.127,"I am risking exposure to highly contagious, possibly deadly, virus to deliver people's Denver.",208,,
1083,0.97,6567.127,6572.532,"Although extremely weak, coughing and having trouble taking a full breath, I kept working because it was my only source of income.",208,,
1084,0.97,6572.532,6575.669,At times I was too weak to work or finish my shift.,208,,
1085,0.97,6575.669,6577.904,I lost my opportunity to earn income.,208,,
1086,0.97,6577.904,6582.442,"Gig work is my only income, so I am now behind on all my monthly bills.",208,,
1087,0.97,6582.442,6591.051,"I work as much as possible, but there are days where I only make enough for the next day to put gas in the car and grab a few groceries.",208,,
1088,0.97,6591.051,6596.823,"I do not live paycheck to paycheck, I live day to day.",208,,
1089,0.97,6596.823,6598.558,I live order to order.,208,,
1090,0.97,6598.558,6602.429,I do not know how I will financially recover.,208,,
1091,0.97,6602.429,6605.131,I'm still experiencing waves of Covid-19 symptoms.,208,,
1092,0.97,6605.131,6606.8,"At times, I'm not able to work.",208,,
1093,0.97,6606.8,6613.039,With sick leave I will now make sure that I will never be in that situation.,208,,
1094,0.97,6613.039,6619.713,"With sick leave, I would have not had to work when I was very sick and possibly spread the virus.",208,,
1095,0.97,6619.713,6621.781,"With sick leave, I would have stayed home.",208,,
1096,0.97,6621.781,6625.151,"With sick leave, I may have recovered faster.",208,,
1097,0.97,6625.151,6631.558,"So thank you, council colleagues for all of your work to support this legislation, and it's a good day.",208,,
1098,0.97,6631.558,6638.565,Thanks for all the workers and their time and for all of the Stakeholders who provided input on this piece of legislation.,208,,

1100,0.97,6641.334,6649.643,So that closes out our debate on this particular Council bill.,209,,
1101,0.97,6649.643,6657.117,So I'm going to ask the clerk calls a count on the bill.,209,,

1129,0.97,6729.489,6736.229,Last week we sent around a proclamation acknowledging June as Lgbtq pride month.,230,,
1130,0.97,6736.229,6746.906,"As I mentioned earlier, the flag raising that we had scheduled for this afternoon has been postponed for the time being.",230,,
1131,0.97,6746.906,6770.563,"So before I ask for your consent to add your signature, I would like to read a letter from one of the Lgbtq commissioners who responded and sent us a statement that she asked to have read today since that flag raising is delayed.",230,,
1132,0.97,6770.563,6774.033,So I will go ahead and do that for her.,230,,
1133,0.97,6774.033,6782.609,"She says, while these are challenging times for Lgbtq black people, I wish to acknowledge that June is gay pride month.",230,,
1134,0.97,6782.609,6792.952,"While there were other gay liberation riots before the 1969 stonewall riots, our community commemorates pride annually on the anniversary of the stonewall riots.",230,,
1135,0.97,6792.952,6804.464,"This month we celebrate our history, courage and the resilience of those who came before us and fought back against police brutality and Transphobic and Homophobic oppression.",230,,
1136,0.97,6804.464,6813.573,"It is more important than ever to share our stories of how pride began, because we are still fighting for complete civil rights for all Lgbtq people.",230,,
1137,0.97,6813.573,6833.726,"When we honor and talk about pride this month, it's important to take time to reflect not only on the recent killing of George Floyd and other African-Americans but to honor and acknowledge our Trans and gender Noncorming community members who were murdered in 2020.",230,,
