85,0.97,700.766,723.622,"Councilmember Herbold leaned over to me and said, ""This is one of the best campaigns we have seen ."" it was very powerful and important . as a result, that year for the first time we moved forward with really significant, meaningful funding to allow for hygiene and Toileting facilities to be set up.",20,,
86,0.97,723.622,736.035,Little did we know how critically important those kind of investments would be when shortly thereafter we were faced with a global pandemic.,20,,
87,0.97,736.035,740.539,Especially at this on presented nature.,20,,
88,0.97,740.539,760.426,"The book you gave us after you won the campaign, which is ""everybody Poops"" is it sitting in my library.",20,,

241,0.97,1582.48,1586.151,His right-wing political views were very clear when Seattle police officers elected him a year ago as their spokesman.,73,,
242,0.97,1586.151,1599.164,He ran for that position as a hardliner with a Video Glorifying Militarized policing.,73,,

244,0.97,1603.201,1606.271,It has always been clear who he is and what he believes and what he supports.,73,,
245,0.97,1606.271,1610.875,We should not be surprised to hear misleading and extreme statements because the Nine- year SPD reform project is not working.,73,,
246,0.97,1610.875,1623.321,Aggressive anti-democratic poise and attitude is dominant in SPD because our city has failed to hold Seattle police officers accountable for undue aggression and violence.,73,,
247,0.97,1623.321,1632.831,We saw their immunity in the streets while we cannot change the cover police without accountability.,73,,
248,0.97,1632.831,1636.901,Opa has opened a preliminary investigation into Sawant's recent comments.,73,,

263,0.97,1709.808,1734.232,"I believe that the citizens of Seattle, the vast majority of citizens are suffering as the Council and city government focus on the needs of relatively few, which I believe those needs are significant, but I believe it is misguided to pursue a policy of permissive is him that encourages more of the same behavior.",77,,
264,0.97,1734.232,1748.68,I think it has been shown that we have people that are camping and abusing drugs and making our cup public spaces unusable for the regular taxpaying citizens.,77,,
265,0.97,1748.68,1775.673,"Those people are coming from all over the geographic area, not just Seattle because of this permissive culture that we have here . I believe the real issue is mental health and drug abuse, and I think that is what we should be doing, focusing on those things and enforcing the laws we have and expanding diversion programs into mental health facilities.",77,,
266,0.97,1775.673,1784.816,But I do not believe --,77,,

360,0.97,2433.197,2436.634,I am glad to vote in favor of this resolution supporting the impeachment of Donald Trump.,111,,
361,0.97,2436.634,2438.636,Donald Trump should have been impeached long ago.,111,,
362,0.97,2438.636,2454.952,She he should have been impeached for massive handouts to his own companies at the expense of vital social services for failing to represent working people and instead representing the billionaire class beginning with himself.,111,,
363,0.97,2454.952,2466.063,"He should have been impeached for utterly criminal approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has undoubtedly directly caused tens of thousands of lives.",111,,
364,0.97,2466.063,2467.932,He should have been impeached for Caging children.,111,,
365,0.97,2467.932,2474.171,He should have been impeached for sexually assaulting so many women.,111,,
366,0.97,2474.171,2487.852,It is important that the Democratic party has done so little to fight his far right agenda over the past four years.,111,,
367,0.97,2487.852,2489.253,Impeachment at this time would be symbolic.,111,,
368,0.97,2489.253,2505.269,"I fully support it because we need to make it crystal clear that there is no support for this right-wing violence, but impeachment in the last few days of the Trump Presidency are not a substitute for a resistance to his agenda over the last four years or to building a left alternative to the right wing going forward.",111,,
369,0.97,2505.269,2524.521,"With mass protests and political demands that would genuinely help working-class people like the Greendale and Medicare for all, there could have been a grassroots organizing by providing a genuine progressive alternative to the corporate establishment and also to do right.",111,,
370,0.97,2524.521,2539.603,Trump took advantage and was able to falsely pretend to be an Antiestablishment alternative and he won over 74 million votes in the last election.,111,,
371,0.97,2539.603,2544.408,This should alarm anyone serious about fighting the right.,111,,
372,0.97,2544.408,2545.576,Biden won over 81 million votes.,111,,
373,0.97,2545.576,2551.282,He is the first U.S. President to have won more than 80 million votes.,111,,
374,0.97,2551.282,2559.556,"Trump won over 74 million votes, which is more votes than any other presidential candidate has ever won with the exception of Biden.",111,,
375,0.97,2559.556,2570.2,We know that all of this will do lasting damage unless we build the left and social movements.,111,,
376,0.97,2570.2,2576.774,Wednesday's far right mob in D.C. in a violent attempt to overturn a Democratic election results should be understood as a Wake-Up call for the left.,111,,
377,0.97,2576.774,2600.564,"Not surprisingly, the media report address more protests at all 50 state capitals and in Washington, D.C. in the days leading up to Joe Biden's Inauguration, stroking fears of more bloodshed.",111,,
378,0.97,2600.564,2604.601,The right will continue to Scarily grow as long as there is no alternative to the status quo of politics.,111,,
379,0.97,2604.601,2615.212,"Despite their differences, the two parties serve the interest of business and put the burden of the Covid crisis and brutal recession on ordinary people.",111,,
380,0.97,2615.212,2641.405,"In Seattle, most immediately our movement needs to make sure the city council is accountable to the black lives matter movement, to the working class, and all those fighting the right thing to make sure all 27 that will be voting yes on the impeached Trump resolution should make sure to pass the strongest possible ordinance on the band on the use of crowd control weapons.",111,,
381,0.97,2641.405,2650.914,I want to be clear that my office looks forward to working with any and all Councilmembers who want to make sure the best and strongest possible ordinance is upheld.,111,,
382,0.97,2650.914,2657.955,Nationally the best and only way to stop the far right is to build the left and social movements.,111,,
383,0.97,2657.955,2665.863,"This is the only way we are going to pull millions of ordinary people away from the right wing's influence, by building a powerful fight back in the interest of the working class.",111,,
384,0.97,2665.863,2677.541,There should be a massive force led by unions and the left.,111,,
385,0.97,2677.541,2680.911,"This week, we heard the inspiring announcement of employees at Google forming the alphabet workers Union.",111,,
386,0.97,2680.911,2683.18,This is a step in the direction of what is urgently needed.,111,,
387,0.97,2683.18,2685.282,The rebuilding of a militant American labor Union.,111,,
388,0.97,2685.282,2690.554,We cannot expect Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi to provide any Alternativs.,111,,
389,0.97,2690.554,2705.569,That is what I have endorsed a grassroots campaign which demands the squad and other movement elected Democrats use a floor board on Medicare for all as part of a larger strategy to build a fighting movement for socialized medicine.,111,,
390,0.97,2705.569,2719.783,Representatives of working people cannot support Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the house as millions faced misery as even squad members have Unfortunately have done.,111,,
391,0.97,2719.783,2723.02,"While I agree Trump should be in peace, this should not be our main focus.",111,,
392,0.97,2723.02,2743.14,"The left has the responsibility to address the urgent needs of the working class and that means as a starting point, fighting tooth and nail for Medicare for all, comprehensive Covid relief, a Socialist green new deal, and preparing the ground to launch a new party.",111,,
393,0.97,2743.14,2756.019,"This is a critical juncture in history and we cannot accept the false unity with the corrupt Democratic establishment but instead, we need to build a power fee and fight for a different kind of society.",111,,
394,0.97,2756.019,2763.627,The final point I will make is that we need to be clear about what needs to be condemned . I condemn Trump's violence and the right wing bigoted agenda it serves.,111,,
395,0.97,2763.627,2771.268,"I condemn the attempt to steal the election, a Democratic election results.",111,,
396,0.97,2771.268,2778.942,I condemn this Conman for posing as a representative for working people while being part of the rotten billionaire class.,111,,
397,0.97,2778.942,2790.821,We have to be careful about words like treason in a way that can BACKFIRE on working people.,111,,
398,0.97,2790.821,2793.357,These words have been used by elected officials throughout the nation since Wednesday.,111,,
399,0.97,2793.357,2797.861,These are words that are used overwhelmingly to adapt movement of socialists and the labor movement.,111,,
400,0.97,2797.861,2808.772,"In 1919, the great American Socialist Eugene was sentenced to a decade in prison for speaking out against World War I courageously.",111,,
401,0.97,2808.772,2827.224,"That same year, Seattle Socialist Anna Louise strong, the last Socialist elected in Seattle, was part of a movement against World War I. she publicly and courageously stood by the industrial workers and one of their staff members who was then jailed for opposing the war.",111,,
402,0.97,2827.224,2848.345,"After that, she herself was recalled from office at the school board for her Association and those that were courageously opposing World War I. the Smith Act of 1940 was created in response on an attack on the far right but was used to attack the far left and the labor movement.",111,,

407,0.97,2862.893,2877.241,"I want to point out that there has been some speculation in the media that it is strategically worth it to Impeach Trump, or the value of Impeaching Trump at this late stage.",113,,
408,0.97,2877.241,2882.679,"It is important to know that the Constitution provides that when someone is impeached, they are disqualified from holding that office in the future.",113,,

412,0.97,2915.212,2926.623,I think it is important to point out.,113,,
413,0.97,2926.623,2982.846,"Before we saw the worst of America on Wednesday, we saw the best of America on Tuesday when the people of Georgia sent the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist church, the Ministry of Dr. King, Raffaella Warnock and John off to the Senate in violation and in condemnation of the divisive politics of President Trump and explicit rejection of senators who had been running on a campaign of confrontation and the kind of Divisiveness for . President Trump has called and following on the disaster after President Trump, to have unified control of the Federal Government on policies and platforms to the division of this country that President Trump has perpetrated.",113,,
414,0.97,2982.846,3031.962,"I just want to lift up briefly in a limited, you know, to the extent that I can hear that that was only do to incredible effort of normal people and communities and neighborhoods all over this country who were Apolitical, who never voted, who were never involved, who never acted, who saw it as their duty to fight for Georgia for voter integrity and security or Stacey Abrams as a community and movement leader.",113,,
415,0.97,3033.497,3041.738,I am optimistic that the spirit that was present on Tuesday will be a guiding force of American politics to come in the future instead of the division and treason that we saw on Wednesday.,113,,
