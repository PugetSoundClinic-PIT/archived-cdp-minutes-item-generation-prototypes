212,0.97,1383.248,1386.651,So those are our 11 appointees.,29,,

256,0.97,1552.217,1558.256,You want to read into the record and then I will say a few words.,52,,
257,0.97,1558.256,1565.63,"Agenda item 13, council member 119964.",53,,
258,0.97,1565.63,1579.844,An Ordnance relating to the Seattle center Department authorizing the Seattle center director to execute the third amendment to the facility use and occupancy agreement between the city of Seattle and the Seattle repertory theater.,53,,
259,0.97,1579.844,1583.214,I understand you have other folks you might want to introduce.,54,,
260,0.97,1583.214,1589.721,You want to go ahead and take us away.,54,,
261,0.97,1589.721,1590.855,Oh there's Benita.,54,,
262,0.97,1590.855,1601.333,I'm Robert Nelums director of the Seattle center and a member of our team Julia Lovete is here.,55,,
263,0.97,1601.333,1602.867,Julia did all the heavy lifting on this.,55,,
264,0.97,1602.867,1607.272,If I present just look at her and say thank you.,55,,
265,0.97,1607.272,1608.206,We have Benita from Seattle Rep.,55,,
266,0.97,1608.206,1618.85,"Great, so are you just going to take us through this power point or who's in?",56,,
267,0.97,1618.85,1629.26,Good to see you Julia.,56,,
268,0.97,1636.468,1637.302,You too.,57,,
269,0.97,1637.302,1637.802,Go ahead.,58,,
270,0.97,1637.802,1641.873,So I won't span a great deal amount of time on this.,59,,
271,0.97,1641.873,1644.376,But just as background for the Seattle Rep.,59,,
272,0.97,1644.376,1649.981,You know it's one of the oldest theaters.,59,,
273,0.97,1649.981,1651.616,It is the oldest theater on the campus.,59,,
274,0.97,1651.616,1656.988,And it's been here since right after the world's fair.,59,,
275,0.97,1656.988,1667.465,I think it's really important to know that it was kind of even though the theater was here.,59,,
276,0.97,1667.465,1674.673,When the Rep was built it was the first new facility since the world's fair.,59,,
277,0.97,1674.673,1686.451,"I know sometimes people kind of say, Public-Private partnerships.",59,,
278,0.97,1686.451,1690.088,Without Public-Private partnerships there would be no facilities at the center.,59,,
279,0.97,1690.088,1696.628,Everything that is here other than the original building is a Public-Private partnership.,59,,
280,0.97,1696.628,1702.133,We can move to the next slide.,59,,
281,0.97,1702.133,1714.245,"I kind of skip over why we're doing, you know why we're doing this everyone understands Covid has kind of run rampant through a lot of different things.",59,,
282,0.97,1714.245,1722.587,This is a different approach here with this third amendment for the Seattle Rep facility use agreement.,59,,
283,0.97,1722.587,1727.225,This legislation will authorize the director to execute this amendment.,59,,
284,0.97,1727.225,1732.764,"And basically, when you boil it down, this is what's going to happen.",59,,
285,0.97,1732.764,1739.771,"One, there's a fund that has been created the Srt replacement trust fund.",59,,
286,0.97,1739.771,1749.481,"What we're going to say is, okay Rep you don't have to make your contributions to that fund in 2019 Or2020.",59,,
287,0.97,1749.481,1752.283,"That fund has over $800,000 in it.",59,,
288,0.97,1752.283,1763.228,It will also allow the Seattle repertory theater to call on that fund to help with their operating expenses.,59,,
289,0.97,1763.228,1772.337,That fund was set up way back when when we negotiated this agreement.,59,,
290,0.97,1772.337,1775.006,And actually amendment 1 I believe.,59,,
291,0.97,1775.006,1778.71,It was solely designated for replacement maintenance and repair of the theater.,59,,
292,0.97,1778.71,1786.05,So it could not be used for anything like operating expenses.,59,,
293,0.97,1786.05,1792.657,"Well with Covid, the replacement of the and maintenance and repair of the theater was kind of a secondary thing.",59,,
294,0.97,1792.657,1796.594,Survival is the initial and most important thing.,59,,
295,0.97,1796.594,1806.871,"And so, this amendment will allow the Seattle repertory theater temporary condition that will extend through June 30th of 2022.",59,,
296,0.97,1806.871,1816.481,That would allow them to draw on that Seattle repertory Theter.,59,,
297,0.97,1816.481,1819.784,I think it's important to note a couple of things.,59,,
298,0.97,1819.784,1821.786,Go to the next slide please.,59,,
299,0.97,1821.786,1827.959,I think it's important to note the trust fund is the Seattle repertory theater.,59,,
300,0.97,1827.959,1831.396,It's managed by them in corporation with the city.,59,,
301,0.97,1831.396,1837.235,The lease basically says that they have to use it for certain things and the city has to approve it.,59,,
302,0.97,1837.235,1841.906,"And no money is being used in this, in this at all.",59,,
303,0.97,1841.906,1846.311,No city money I should say is being used at all for this.,59,,
304,0.97,1846.311,1863.228,"Because back in 2009 the city stopped making contributions to this fund as part of amendment 2. and so, Seattle repertory theater that's part of this will maintain a minimum balance of $160,000.",59,,
305,0.97,1863.228,1870.368,"They will be able to draw down about $100,000 of that if they so choose.",59,,
306,0.97,1870.368,1877.141,Then they will be required to draw down the funds as they go forward.,59,,
307,0.97,1877.141,1892.39,"And so, I think this is, in our world this is kind of a way of using existing funds in a different way and allowing people to survive in a way that would be beneficial to not only them but to our community.",59,,
308,0.97,1892.39,1896.628,"Because the Rep could, will be there and will be standing tall again.",59,,
309,0.97,1896.628,1907.538,"And in our world this is something that, because they will reimburse the fund over time.",59,,
310,0.97,1907.538,1910.975,This is something that is a Win- win for the Seattle center.,59,,
311,0.97,1910.975,1915.013,A Win-Win for the city and a Win-Win for Seattle Rep.,59,,
312,0.97,1915.013,1922.82,With that I will ask Julia if I missed anything and if she would like to add anything because like I said she did all the work.,59,,
313,0.97,1922.82,1923.855,Hi Julia.,60,,
314,0.97,1923.855,1924.255,Thanks.,61,,
315,0.97,1924.255,1926.958,I want to apologize for my winter attire.,61,,
316,0.97,1926.958,1930.261,"We have our windows occupy here in the armory for air circulation, it's cold.",61,,
317,0.97,1930.261,1933.131,I was going to ask about your hat.,62,,
318,0.97,1933.131,1934.766,I'm not going lie I was looking at.,62,,
319,0.97,1934.766,1945.71,"Once you put a hot on you can't take it off because your hair, any way, put a hat on you can't take it off because your hair, any way.",63,,
320,0.97,1945.71,1947.278,Robert covered everything pretty well.,63,,
321,0.97,1947.278,1954.252,I wanted to clarify there was one point where he mentioned the city had stopped making contributions into the fund in 2009.,63,,
322,0.97,1954.252,1957.422,There's actually two separate funds.,63,,
323,0.97,1957.422,1967.665,The city has a fund that it holds extra money and a completely different fund that holds Seattle Rep money.,63,,
324,0.97,1967.665,1968.433,And that's all.,63,,
325,0.97,1968.433,1977.241,Yeah we stopped making contribution to the city fund in 2009.,64,,
326,0.97,1977.241,1978.409,So thank you.,64,,
327,0.97,1978.409,1980.645,Councilmembers or any of my colleagues have any questions?,65,,
328,0.97,1980.645,1989.988,I wanted to make sure you gave Benita an opportunity to talk about Seattle Rep's perspective.,66,,
329,0.97,1989.988,1990.388,Sorry Benita.,67,,
330,0.97,1990.388,1991.856,No problem.,68,,
331,0.97,1991.856,1997.695,I just want to extend my thanks to Robert and Julia.,68,,
332,0.97,1997.695,2003.034,It's so helpful and so grateful for this opportunity provided to us.,68,,
333,0.97,2003.034,2007.238,Again this is Seattle Rep funds that has been put aside for the last several years.,68,,
334,0.97,2007.238,2014.879,I've been here only a year but my predecessor has been really wonderful in putting these funds aside.,68,,
335,0.97,2014.879,2019.384,And they were set aside for capital related projects.,68,,
336,0.97,2019.384,2021.252,But today is a different world.,68,,
337,0.97,2021.252,2026.157,We are in the process of figuring out how to pay our next payroll.,68,,
338,0.97,2026.157,2037.135,And I think these funds will be extremely helpful as we plan to navigate through this crisis which is expected to last at least another year from today.,68,,
339,0.97,2037.135,2039.137,We are hopeful it will be seven Mnths or so.,68,,
340,0.97,2039.137,2043.708,But we still have a long way to go.,68,,
341,0.97,2043.708,2048.513,"And now, we couldn't appreciate more you allowing us to do this.",68,,
342,0.97,2048.513,2048.846,Thank you.,69,,
343,0.97,2048.846,2049.313,Thank you Benita.,70,,
344,0.97,2049.313,2059.824,Is that all on your team.,71,,
345,0.97,2061.259,2062.593,Councilmember Herbolt will speak.,71,,
346,0.97,2062.593,2067.498,It addresses not just 2020 contribution to the fund but the plan 2019 contribution.,72,,
347,0.97,2067.498,2105.77,"I just wanting to hear a little bit more about whether or notes that an indicator of a financial difficulty that is separate from the pandemic and whether or not there are concerns that, that there might be an outcome that would have delayed that would be paid out of the fund.",72,,
348,0.97,2105.77,2112.21,And if so what maintenance might be delayed.,72,,
349,0.97,2112.21,2113.644,Can I ask you the same.,73,,
350,0.97,2113.644,2115.112,Do you want to go ahead.,73,,
351,0.97,2115.112,2118.449,"Sure, I can answer both questions.",74,,
352,0.97,2118.449,2127.558,2019 contribution into the fund was Expcted to happen June 2020 right in the middle of the pandemic.,74,,
353,0.97,2127.558,2130.294,So really we were right in the middle of a crisis already.,74,,
354,0.97,2130.294,2132.263,It has nothing to do with the prior year.,74,,
355,0.97,2132.263,2144.308,As a matter of fact we reported a fiscal 2020.,74,,
356,0.97,2144.308,2154.519,No concerns there in terms of issues with the financial instability of the organization.,74,,
357,0.97,2154.519,2159.49,"We have $160,000 set aside for maintenance or capital projects.",74,,
358,0.97,2159.49,2171.302,And I went back to our operations team before Julian and I put these numbers together to determine what projects are coming up our way the next couple of years.,74,,
359,0.97,2171.302,2176.707,And that's the good number that we could come up with.,74,,
360,0.97,2176.707,2179.911,So I don't think anything serious is going to be put aside.,74,,
361,0.97,2179.911,2180.711,Again I want to highlight that.,74,,
362,0.97,2180.711,2196.027,"This is only in the case of, you know we're trying our best through our fund raising efforts and others to keep us going and not tapping into this.",74,,
363,0.97,2196.027,2198.996,I hope that answers your question,74,,
364,0.97,2198.996,2200.698,Thank you very much.,75,,
365,0.97,2200.698,2208.906,Is there any other discussions or questions from my colleagues.,76,,
366,0.97,2208.906,2209.84,Councilmember Mosqueda go ahead.,77,,
367,0.97,2209.84,2220.785,Just to put a finer point on it can you reiterate for the Seattle Rep just so we have it in context for the urgency.,78,,
368,0.97,2220.785,2240.237,"Sure, so we are right now, planning to, we are in the process of budgeting for our reopening.",79,,
369,0.97,2240.237,2242.306,We have several thousand dollars to relaunch.,79,,
370,0.97,2242.306,2245.61,Obviously some of that would be through fund raising.,79,,
371,0.97,2245.61,2249.246,But fund raising cash is some what unpredictable which is understandable.,79,,
372,0.97,2249.246,2261.325,So I would say it's something that would come in really handy for us over the next seven to 12 months before we actually come back into business and are able to sell our tickets.,79,,
373,0.97,2261.325,2270.234,Great thank you so much.,80,,
374,0.97,2270.234,2270.534,Yeah.,81,,
375,0.97,2270.534,2273.604,This is just an amendment to the 1996.,82,,
376,0.97,2273.604,2274.138,Yes.,83,,
377,0.97,2274.138,2285.716,I'm thinking the last two came out of but they didn't this is from way back.,84,,
378,0.97,2285.716,2287.251,Agreements go through 2026 right now.,85,,
379,0.97,2287.251,2289.453,I was just looking at that right now.,86,,
380,0.97,2289.453,2289.654,Okay.,86,,
381,0.97,2289.654,2297.361,Is there anything else for my colleagues.,86,,

434,0.97,2502.733,2504.235,We have some Presenters here.,119,,
435,0.97,2504.235,2506.27,Jesus you know what to do.,119,,

437,0.97,2508.806,2513.244,"Thank you, council member and thanks to all the Council members.",120,,
438,0.97,2513.244,2521.185,I have to say it's really refreshing conducting some business that isn't pandemic related so I really appreciate that opportunity.,120,,
439,0.97,2521.185,2522.586,I will kick us off.,120,,
440,0.97,2522.586,2533.13,But with me we have Bryan Judd.,120,,
441,0.97,2545.276,2552.616,I'm going to kick it off but they will all participate.,120,,
442,0.97,2552.616,2556.086,And the tennis was built and opened in 2013.,120,,
443,0.97,2556.086,2561.592,The tennis center and assuming most of you have been by there.,120,,
444,0.97,2561.592,2570.901,Provide programs for all ages and including as with all of our other tenants provides public benefits as part of the agreement that we're looking to amend.,120,,
445,0.97,2570.901,2579.31,We'll get into more detail there when Brian and Mr.,120,,
446,0.97,2579.31,2581.579,Marshall go through the presentation.,120,,
447,0.97,2581.579,2585.015,This amendment is related to building 41 which you heard Mr.,120,,
448,0.97,2585.015,2586.016,Bronson testify as well on.,120,,
449,0.97,2586.016,2597.227,"This is a former gas station that sort of adjacent to the tennis center property and of course adjacent to the new property, new building that they're going to build.",120,,
450,0.97,2597.227,2601.799,This originally was going to be a Proshop for the tennis center.,120,,
451,0.97,2601.799,2606.136,Since that agreement was signed in 2010 a lot has changed.,120,,
452,0.97,2606.136,2610.107,I've discovered the cost for renovating that building is much higher than we expected.,120,,
453,0.97,2610.107,2621.952,And things got much more complicated when the sand point historic district was established just a year after the addition was signed.,120,,
454,0.97,2621.952,2627.491,We've gotten interest to Redevelop that building and some folks want us to Redevelop into a visitor center.,120,,
455,0.97,2627.491,2631.395,We're asking to amend the agreement to take that building out of the agreement.,120,,
456,0.97,2631.395,2635.199,That would allow us to pursue other plans.,120,,
457,0.97,2635.199,2638.302,Other option s for that.,120,,
458,0.97,2638.302,2644.875,And we have an option for an additional 5 year extension to the original agreement that we have with the tennis center.,120,,
459,0.97,2644.875,2658.789,"As I mentioned, we've done a lot of, there will be some discussion about public benefit and I will say and I appreciate all the work of this Committee and help supporting us and guiding us on our work on public benefit and we have a new policy in place.",120,,
460,0.97,2658.789,2667.698,We have better reporting mechanisms we're much more transparent in terms of the public benefits that come to the public through these agreements.,120,,
461,0.97,2667.698,2676.006,And really you're looking to ensure that we're responsive and provide access to our committee Membering.,120,,
462,0.97,2676.006,2679.977,So part of this you will see there's free and reduced cost.,120,,
463,0.97,2679.977,2686.483,And we're posting those on our Website so folks understand what's available and we're holding people accountable frankly.,120,,
464,0.97,2686.483,2692.222,I'm not picking at all on the tenants.,120,,
465,0.97,2692.222,2702.399,We've just gotten better to make sure we're holding people accountable and make sure people are doing what they agreed to do.,120,,
466,0.97,2702.399,2713.877,And we want to thank Tracy Ratcliff who has been really helpful in helping us work through all of this.,120,,
467,0.97,2713.877,2718.749,"Before Brian kicks off here, we have Tracy Ratcliff with us.",121,,
468,0.97,2718.749,2725.022,And I'm guessing Mr. Marshall is from the tennis group.,121,,
469,0.97,2725.022,2729.693,And Brian who we worked with before is walking us through this.,121,,
470,0.97,2729.693,2732.129,And hats off to you too Jesus.,121,,
471,0.97,2732.129,2742.706,Over the last few years you worked with us and Tracy you really bolstered us.,121,,
472,0.97,2742.706,2750.314,In we want to public back in public.,121,,
473,0.97,2750.314,2762.626,When we started back in 2016 to where we are now we've come a long way.,121,,
474,0.97,2762.626,2765.129,You're able to see my screen here.,122,,
475,0.97,2765.129,2765.362,Yes.,123,,
476,0.97,2765.362,2765.629,Great.,124,,
477,0.97,2765.629,2772.469,"Úlet me just put it in slide show format, there we go.",124,,
478,0.97,2772.469,2773.971,Hi everybody.,124,,
479,0.97,2773.971,2776.573,As Jesus mentioned I'm Brian Judd.,124,,
480,0.97,2776.573,2781.311,Scott Marshall is with me here he's the general manager of the tennis center.,124,,
481,0.97,2781.311,2781.678,Welcome Scott.,124,,
482,0.97,2781.678,2788.519,And we are here to talk about proposing an amendment to their concession agreements.,124,,
483,0.97,2788.519,2791.755,I first want to center everybody about kind of what we're talking about here.,124,,
484,0.97,2791.755,2803.7,So on the left here is the zoom in on the Magnuson park map.,124,,
485,0.97,2803.7,2805.435,And the gas station is right next door.,124,,
486,0.97,2805.435,2808.906,That gives you a sense of what we're talking about here on the map.,124,,
487,0.97,2808.906,2814.178,I also want to just point out the tennis center's location to all of these fields here.,124,,
488,0.97,2814.178,2821.985,To the right and kind of down to the South there that's going to be a key point for the public benefit they have outlined in their agreement.,124,,
489,0.97,2821.985,2828.325,And to the right is the Footprint of the tennis center itself showing the two indoor courts.,124,,
490,0.97,2828.325,2837.201,And so just so folks can see where it's at on the park and the relevance in terms of that Footprint.,124,,
491,0.97,2837.201,2842.339,"And two indoor buildings, just to clarify.",125,,
492,0.97,2842.339,2846.043,Yes I meant two indoor buildings.,126,,
493,0.97,2846.043,2848.879,Are the tenants part of the Bregg.,127,,
494,0.97,2848.879,2851.815,They are part of the Bregg.,128,,
495,0.97,2851.815,2856.587,There's a few tenants there in the bridge.,128,,
496,0.97,2856.587,2861.225,You want to give a little background on how you got started with parks.,128,,
497,0.97,2861.225,2866.997,"Thank you for the Intro, Brian.",129,,
498,0.97,2866.997,2868.265,I'm happy to be here.,129,,
499,0.97,2868.265,2871.969,There's a lot of interest with this project.,129,,
500,0.97,2871.969,2879.309,There was interest to build this tennis community center 20 years ago.,129,,
501,0.97,2879.309,2883.914,Me and my partner Yohan we got involved in the later end of that process.,129,,
502,0.97,2883.914,2895.659,This is 16 years of involvement for this project for Yohan and I. we started we made a proposal to the parking Department in 2005 to bring a tennis center to the park.,129,,
503,0.97,2895.659,2904.468,And it took us eight years from the time of that proposal to actually open the tennis center and now we're in our 8th year of operations.,129,,
504,0.97,2904.468,2907.571,Clearly there was a community need for this.,129,,
505,0.97,2907.571,2911.174,I mean the demand has exceeded our expectations.,129,,
506,0.97,2911.174,2916.546,We probably have one of the highest occupancy rates of any tennis center in the nation.,129,,
507,0.97,2916.546,2929.559,"So it's, you know I think one of our greatest challenges is to you know balance all this demand and making sure we offer programs for all ages and skill levels.",129,,
508,0.97,2929.559,2932.529,"You know, it was a, it was quite a struggle to get this point.",129,,
509,0.97,2932.529,2935.832,I should mention that as part of our history.,129,,
510,0.97,2935.832,2943.307,You know we operated for three years inside of one of the naval hangers.,129,,
511,0.97,2943.307,2943.607,Hanger 30.,129,,
512,0.97,2943.607,2943.874,Yeah.,130,,
513,0.97,2943.874,2947.21,Where Yohan my business partner was doing a little bit of everything.,131,,
514,0.97,2947.21,2949.546,"Feeding balls, being the GM of that facility.",131,,
515,0.97,2949.546,2956.787,So that it took a lot of community effort and you know just incredible history to get here.,131,,
516,0.97,2956.787,2965.028,"We're pretty proud of what we've created and, hopefully that provides some of the background.",131,,
517,0.97,2965.028,2965.295,Great.,132,,
518,0.97,2965.295,2966.363,Thank you Scott very much.,132,,
519,0.97,2966.363,2968.065,Here we are now in 2020.,132,,
520,0.97,2968.065,2974.237,A little bit of further background on the concession agreement itself that's currently executed.,132,,
521,0.97,2974.237,2979.376,It was signed and executed in 2010 it was a 20 year agreement.,132,,
522,0.97,2979.376,2983.814,And as Jesus mentioned building 41 was supposed to be a Proshop.,132,,
523,0.97,2983.814,2992.923,And various kind of dollar signs and the historic district that came afterward made that a bit of a complicated effort.,132,,
524,0.97,2992.923,2997.761,We learned a lot about public benefit as everyone here mentioned.,132,,
525,0.97,2997.761,3010.24,"So what this amendment really does outline is first of all, transferring the management of building 41 back to Seattle parks and recreation so that we could open it up to different kinds of development.",132,,
526,0.97,3010.24,3016.346,There is some interest in having it be a visitor center in the park amongst some other ideas.,132,,
527,0.97,3016.346,3022.886,And the public benefit language has been strengthened to align with our current standards.,132,,
528,0.97,3022.886,3030.093,And exhibit G outlines a pretty clear menu of examples for the tennis center to form its annual public benefit plan.,132,,
529,0.97,3030.093,3035.732,It's important to note here that that plan will be submitted and approved on an annual basis.,132,,
530,0.97,3035.732,3042.973,Which means that it will allow us to meet emerging needs that we can't anticipate today.,132,,
531,0.97,3042.973,3057.22,And that the outreach and the efforts to get people to access those public benefits really are supposed to be focused in primarily on the residents that live in Magnuson park and that is spelled out in that exhibit.,132,,
532,0.97,3057.22,3073.303,And you know Council member Peterson's office also strengthen this section as well as capping it at a 20% offset from the base concession fee.,132,,
533,0.97,3073.303,3083.713,Also included here is a five term.,132,,
534,0.97,3083.713,3085.649,Before I let Scott chat a little bit.,132,,
535,0.97,3085.649,3094.424,I do want to give a little bit of a comparison that the 20% caps that outlined in the agreement is fairly comparable to what we provide today.,132,,
536,0.97,3094.424,3114.511,"If you are to take the full concession fee for this year and 20% is 18,500 of public benefit offset this year we approved about 14,500.",132,,
537,0.97,3114.511,3116.813,It's a real Win-Win with the amendment.,132,,
538,0.97,3116.813,3137.367,Scott Why don't you jump right in and I'll give them a little bit about your delivery method and how you plan to outreach to Magnuson park tennis center.,132,,
539,0.97,3137.367,3142.639,We've offered more than we've been given credit for as far as a lease.,133,,
540,0.97,3142.639,3150.413,We're doing this a lot of this because we think it's the right thing to do.,133,,
541,0.97,3150.413,3154.951,I mention my business partner Yohan he is the manager of the facility.,133,,
542,0.97,3154.951,3162.425,He's donated his time every year to offer free clinics to some of the kids living in Magnuson park.,133,,
543,0.97,3162.425,3165.729,That was just one of the many things we've done.,133,,
544,0.97,3165.729,3173.703,"I mean Ed Bronson who did the public comment earlier, he mentioned the access tennis for all.",133,,
545,0.97,3173.703,3179.609,The wheelchair tennis program.,133,,
546,0.97,3179.609,3183.513,We've offered subsidized rates for wheelchair tennis participants.,133,,
547,0.97,3183.513,3191.688,"We've had a scholarship program since the beginning but you know based on feed back from the parks Department, and Council member Peterson.",133,,
548,0.97,3191.688,3203.033,"You know we understand that, that the folks living in the park really should be more of the target for our scholarship program and some of the other subsidies we're doing.",133,,
549,0.97,3203.033,3208.138,That has become more of a focus for us going forward.,133,,
550,0.97,3208.138,3218.481,And we have recently developed a partnership with a nonprofit group called the Seattle tennis education foundation.,133,,
551,0.97,3218.481,3221.017,Steff for short.,133,,
552,0.97,3221.017,3229.159,And through that partnership we're hoping to offer for scholarships to kids living at the park.,133,,
553,0.97,3229.159,3231.861,We're looking forward to see what happens with that.,133,,
554,0.97,3231.861,3233.496,It's a fairly new partnership.,133,,
555,0.97,3233.496,3239.569,Unfortunately this year we have not seen it come into full fruition because of the Covid shut downs.,133,,
556,0.97,3239.569,3243.206,We've been shut down for about half the year now.,133,,
557,0.97,3243.206,3252.015,"Hopefully that gives you perspective of what we've been doing, a little perspective of what we've been doing.",133,,
558,0.97,3252.015,3256.886,The reason we push is because it's a public asset.,134,,
559,0.97,3256.886,3270.467,The city of Seattle own it and therefor there has to be the values and policies that we have across the city and the county and that's to raise social equity.,134,,
560,0.97,3270.467,3274.804,Keeping it public and open and access is our guiding principle.,134,,
561,0.97,3274.804,3288.184,Not just to the tennis Club but to everyone who uses the city assets and when they lease them and when they invest in them and they have capital improvements and we have offsets.,134,,
562,0.97,3288.184,3290.02,We're continuously doing that balancing.,134,,
563,0.97,3290.02,3306.136,While I appreciate you're there and we have a Private-Public partnership it's not lost on anybody that when the property came up and we changed the lease to put housing.,134,,
564,0.97,3306.136,3315.078,Those are the policy issues that this city and Council and taxpayers would ask and require that we have the open access public piece.,134,,
565,0.97,3315.078,3343.106,"So that is my little Rant there why I really pushed hard to expand public benefits and asking for variables and numbers and Deliverables of the type of people and the type of outreach that we're using to ensure that everyone in Seattle has access to not only Magnuson but we do the same thing with Lake Washington, we do the same thing with concession stands that are on property.",134,,
566,0.97,3343.106,3348.978,This is just across the board and you will find the same kind of standards obviously within the county.,134,,
567,0.97,3348.978,3357.854,I want to thank you and you and your business partner for the work you've done and the years you put in to make this a success.,134,,
568,0.97,3357.854,3359.756,We work closely with Ed Bronson and the groups there.,134,,
569,0.97,3359.756,3363.293,I look forward to working with you on this and moving forward with you on this.,134,,
570,0.97,3363.293,3365.462,So thank you.,134,,
571,0.97,3365.462,3366.196,"Likewise, thank you.",135,,
572,0.97,3366.196,3368.832,I know we're supposed to have more discussion on this.,136,,
573,0.97,3368.832,3376.373,Is there anything else from the group before we move to my colleagues who may want to add anything.,136,,
574,0.97,3376.373,3377.741,Councilman Peterson I know you have something else.,136,,
575,0.97,3377.741,3387.684,I just want to wrap up the discussion from any of the other Council members including yourself on the discussion of this piece.,136,,
576,0.97,3387.684,3389.219,Council member Juarez.,137,,
577,0.97,3389.219,3389.652,Council sheriff.,137,,
578,0.97,3389.652,3390.253,Hi.,138,,
579,0.97,3390.253,3394.224,Ma'am chair thank you so much.,138,,
580,0.97,3394.224,3405.802,"Just a quick question, on building 41 I think some examples of what the future use were mentioned.",138,,
581,0.97,3405.802,3411.374,But in light of the Conversaion you just made about the need to be a public serving asset.,138,,
582,0.97,3411.374,3428.792,Can you talk a little bit more about the stake holder process for what that could be.,138,,
583,0.97,3428.792,3430.026,And that's my daughter.,138,,
584,0.97,3430.026,3433.596,He's concerned about if process as well.,138,,
585,0.97,3433.596,3434.531,I will start.,138,,
586,0.97,3434.531,3437.333,We don't really have a plan yet.,139,,
587,0.97,3437.333,3460.223,Typically what we would do is an Rfb process to allow them to select what they're doing.,139,,
588,0.97,3460.223,3472.735,We at the Department don't have any funding availability for any of this.,139,,
589,0.97,3472.735,3478.374,There's been some interest with the development center but that's just an idea.,139,,
590,0.97,3478.374,3487.05,Brian I don't know if you've heard anything else.,139,,
591,0.97,3487.05,3493.456,We want to take it out of the agreement.,139,,
592,0.97,3493.456,3501.13,Just following up on Councilmember Mosqueda's question.,140,,
593,0.97,3501.13,3503.9,Are there environmental needs with that property.,140,,
594,0.97,3503.9,3505.468,I would guess yes.,141,,
595,0.97,3505.468,3506.102,Brian probably knows better.,141,,
596,0.97,3506.102,3509.439,That would be part of the planning.,141,,
597,0.97,3509.439,3513.176,"Yeah, I think with Magnuson Park you can always assume yes.",142,,
598,0.97,3513.176,3515.178,Considering it was a gas station we believe so.,142,,
599,0.97,3515.178,3521.484,I think that's why it was so costly to the tennis center about 10 years ago when they were looking into the estimate.,142,,
600,0.97,3521.484,3529.525,"I think Scott correct me if I'm wrong I think it stopped when it reached 650,000 or something like that and you had not even gotten to design.",142,,
601,0.97,3529.525,3531.694,That's a big ask but it'll be significant.,142,,
602,0.97,3531.694,3541.771,Yeah I think part of the issue we did some Geotype work and found some levels of Benzine 14 feet down.,143,,
603,0.97,3541.771,3550.613,There's probably some clean up work that needs to be done as part of the renovation.,143,,
604,0.97,3550.613,3556.419,We're talking about it when it's completely renovating the building and that was cost effective.,143,,
605,0.97,3556.419,3557.153,Thank you.,144,,
606,0.97,3557.153,3557.42,Great.,145,,
607,0.97,3557.42,3558.788,Is there any other.,145,,
608,0.97,3558.788,3565.995,You didn't do any retrofitting on that because we know a lot of capital costs on retrofitting.,145,,
609,0.97,3565.995,3570.466,Did you do any of that Scott?,145,,
610,0.97,3570.466,3571.067,"No, okay.",146,,
611,0.97,3571.067,3575.405,To be clear the tennis center we operated on was built from scratch.,147,,
612,0.97,3575.405,3580.61,It was not an existing building.,147,,
613,0.97,3580.61,3581.377,Only building 41 was existing.,147,,
614,0.97,3581.377,3582.312,Okay.,148,,
615,0.97,3582.312,3595.625,"So, I'm going to move to move and then I'm going to tee you up Councilmember Pederson.",149,,
616,0.97,3595.625,3597.493,I move bill CB 119746.,149,,
617,0.97,3597.493,3598.528,Do I have a second.,149,,
618,0.97,3598.528,3598.861,Second.,150,,
619,0.97,3598.861,3602.532,The bill has been moved and Seconded.,151,,
620,0.97,3602.532,3605.401,Councilmember Peterson I understand you have a motion that you're ready to present.,151,,
621,0.97,3605.401,3607.637,Yes chair.,152,,
622,0.97,3607.637,3613.943,Colleagues this is just to insert the version that has the strength and public benefits in it.,152,,
623,0.97,3613.943,3618.381,So and then I can speak to that a little bit.,152,,
624,0.97,3618.381,3626.356,I move to amend Council bill 119746 attachment one by substituting version two for version 1 B.,152,,
625,0.97,3626.356,3631.394,Okay is there any discussion on the motion?,153,,
626,0.97,3631.394,3632.562,Second.,154,,
627,0.97,3632.562,3633.062,Oh second.,155,,
628,0.97,3633.062,3633.296,Sorry.,155,,
629,0.97,3633.296,3633.596,Thank you.,155,,
630,0.97,3633.596,3637.8,The motion has been moved and Seconded.,155,,
631,0.97,3637.8,3640.937,"So, any discussion on that?",155,,
632,0.97,3640.937,3641.437,Councilmember Peterson.,155,,
633,0.97,3641.437,3645.308,Thank you chair Juarez and thanks to everybody at the parking Department.,156,,
634,0.97,3645.308,3655.518,Questions for me colleagues this is all Syncing up nicely.,156,,
635,0.97,3655.518,3666.496,Magnuson Park is an amazing regional asset and it also comes with a lot of old buildings and other challenges we mentioned with remediation that need attention and investment.,156,,
636,0.97,3666.496,3666.929,"Rehab, maintenance.",156,,
637,0.97,3666.929,3674.704,The parking Department works really hard to try to balance the need for the physical assets and benefits maximizing the benefits to the public.,156,,
638,0.97,3674.704,3680.376,Fortunately the tennis center itself is a rare and newer building at Magnuson park.,156,,
639,0.97,3680.376,3687.583,Two of the main reasons for having this concession agreement on our agenda is to amend it and extend it.,156,,
640,0.97,3687.583,3692.522,The key amendment that was mentioned was to free up this smaller old adjacent building.,156,,
641,0.97,3692.522,3705.234,Building 41 that's not going to be renovated by the tennis center organization and making this change will open it up to building 41 the smaller building up to some new opportunities.,156,,
642,0.97,3705.234,3707.804,That the superintendent mentioned.,156,,
643,0.97,3707.804,3711.774,I also want to make sure there's a robust community process.,156,,
644,0.97,3711.774,3715.645,But getting back to the concession agreement that we're amending.,156,,
645,0.97,3715.645,3724.754,This is an opportunity to Re- examine and update the benefits section of this agreement.,156,,
646,0.97,3724.754,3733.029,The original agreement between the tennis center was renovated many years ago.,156,,
647,0.97,3733.029,3737.667,Hundreds of families now call Magnuson park home with the housing project.,156,,
648,0.97,3737.667,3742.538,That's in addition to the existing low income residents.,156,,
649,0.97,3742.538,3749.579,Now there's 850 low income residents who live at Magnuson park.,156,,
650,0.97,3749.579,3751.781,200 of which identify as Bagpi.,156,,
651,0.97,3751.781,3759.322,For these low income residents are my main focus when I look at Magnuson park and all it has to offer.,156,,
652,0.97,3759.322,3770.633,I'm really focused on the community center building the old community center which is not everyone part not even part of this center.,156,,
653,0.97,3770.633,3776.405,But you will hear me talk a lot about it because they will be the main asset for the residents who live there.,156,,
654,0.97,3776.405,3778.674,So back to this concession agreement.,156,,
655,0.97,3778.674,3790.853,We wanted to update and strengthen the public benefits and to emphasize the benefits for the low income residents of both solid ground and mercy Magnuson.,156,,
656,0.97,3790.853,3792.622,"We work with central staff, parks Department.",156,,
657,0.97,3792.622,3802.365,We want to thank Scott at the tennis center for being on the vanguard of all of these agreements with all these Nonprofits and other organizations.,156,,
658,0.97,3802.365,3811.14,"This is the first we're able to update and say Hey, you need to focus on the 850 residents right there.",156,,
659,0.97,3811.14,3816.546,Let's make sure there's an emphasis for them so that's what this amendment does.,156,,
660,0.97,3816.546,3817.213,Thank you chair.,156,,
661,0.97,3817.213,3817.48,Okay.,157,,
662,0.97,3817.48,3830.593,"So with that, are there any questions for Councilmember Peterson.",157,,
663,0.97,3830.593,3831.694,Councilmember Herbold.,158,,
664,0.97,3831.694,3848.811,This is not particular for this amendment it's more general to the question of the value of the public benefit versus the corresponding percentage of the offset.,159,,
665,0.97,3848.811,3858.254,How do we determine that the value of what we're getting in scholarships and such.,159,,
666,0.97,3858.254,3861.991,Equals the value of the reduction in concession fees.,159,,
667,0.97,3861.991,3866.429,Is it just a simple math question?,159,,
668,0.97,3866.429,3869.899,"I will let, I'll let the superintendent but I had some thoughts.",160,,
669,0.97,3869.899,3872.768,Some of it is math and I will let Tracy.,160,,
670,0.97,3872.768,3878.774,And some is policy and some of it is just us looking at these agreements and with the Deliverables have been.,160,,
671,0.97,3878.774,3880.376,What the outreach has been.,160,,
672,0.97,3880.376,3881.978,What the access has been.,160,,
673,0.97,3881.978,3892.855,And just a quick example in the last four years we had to really struggle with the public benefit piece surrounding slips in Lake Washington.,160,,
674,0.97,3892.855,3904.133,Very interesting but I'm going let the superintendent address that a little bit more because we have discussions about this all the time.,160,,
675,0.97,3904.133,3910.339,And thank you Councilmember Herbold thank you for the great question.,160,,
676,0.97,3910.339,3915.411,"And you covered it, Councilmember Herbold great question.",161,,
677,0.97,3915.411,3918.447,All of this covers whether its tennis lessons or availability.,161,,
678,0.97,3918.447,3920.283,A lot of it is math.,161,,
679,0.97,3920.283,3922.518,And there's evaluation of the service being provided.,161,,
680,0.97,3922.518,3931.594,More and more frankly we find that it's really important on the accountability side is making sure that we understand clearly who folks are reaching out to.,161,,
681,0.97,3931.594,3941.437,In this case frankly it's a little easier because you have all of the low income residents that Councilmember Peterson talked about.,161,,
682,0.97,3941.437,3944.573,They're yearning for the service we're able to provide and this is a great opportunity to do that.,161,,
683,0.97,3944.573,3951.547,"But it is, it is in many ways math and we look at what the evaluation of what this public benefit is compared to the rent.",161,,
684,0.97,3951.547,3957.42,But Bryan I don't know if you want to add more specifics to that.,161,,
685,0.97,3957.42,3970.032,With this particular agreement I would say this is information that Scott and his team have provided us and we've grounded them in the pricing and pricing model.,162,,
686,0.97,3970.032,3983.98,We do after doing due diligence and really nailing down the numbers we believe it's a good faith estimate of what's to come and that annual approval and review that goes to Jesus every year really allows us to make sure that we keep the integrity of it.,162,,
687,0.97,3983.98,3987.283,That's really kind of our process.,162,,
688,0.97,3987.283,3993.522,"Yeah, I will add that in the last four or five years, and Tracy if you want to add anything.",163,,
689,0.97,3993.522,3998.327,We really Ramped up the accountability piece about public and the offset.,163,,
690,0.97,3998.327,4003.966,Because when we start looking at some of these concession agreements and contracts four or five years ago.,163,,
691,0.97,4003.966,4011.574,Again a lot of it is because we weren't looking at it through a race and social justice lens.,163,,
692,0.97,4011.574,4023.419,We weren't pushing some of these lessors and concession operators to show us how they were doing research and outreach not just to their neighborhood or group but city wide.,163,,
693,0.97,4023.419,4033.529,"We've been getting those numbers back in cases and Tracy has been amazing in just doing the tally for me and saying, they do 300 Outreaches, workshops.",163,,
694,0.97,4033.529,4035.664,"This is women, this is children, this is people of color.",163,,
695,0.97,4035.664,4037.4,This is low income.,163,,
696,0.97,4037.4,4041.871,This is people with disabilities.,163,,
697,0.97,4041.871,4047.243,"You know, what schools are being, were being, they were going to schools to recruit for different programs.",163,,
698,0.97,4047.243,4047.676,Conservation core.,163,,
699,0.97,4047.676,4049.211,We could go on and on.,163,,
700,0.97,4049.211,4050.98,So it's a really good question.,163,,
701,0.97,4050.98,4058.02,Tracy did you want to add anything to that Besides what I just rambled on.,163,,
702,0.97,4058.02,4063.926,They're all their own special agreements but we have tried to quantify I think the value of the services provided.,164,,
703,0.97,4063.926,4077.273,"I give parks a lot of credit for working with us on that because I think that was the thing that was a little, less clear and consistent among the various lease agreements early on.",164,,
704,0.97,4077.273,4081.21,You value that class or outreach activity.,164,,
705,0.97,4081.21,4085.414,Slightly different from this one and slightly different organization.,164,,
706,0.97,4085.414,4089.718,We know what the cost is for them to clean the Restrooms so we can quantify that.,164,,
707,0.97,4089.718,4096.225,They get the value of that cleaning and that represents the offset.,164,,
708,0.97,4096.225,4097.76,The scholarships for the tennis membership.,164,,
709,0.97,4097.76,4103.165,We know what the cost of that tennis membership is.,164,,
710,0.97,4103.165,4107.002,Some of these are a lot easier to quantity and services they provide.,164,,
711,0.97,4107.002,4113.175,I think over all I think we have all tried to be much more rational about it and transparent about it.,164,,
712,0.97,4113.175,4121.45,And in particular the issue about outreach and making sure that the public actually knows about these public benefits because prior to a few years ago.,164,,
713,0.97,4121.45,4138.567,If you weren't really diligent in trying to ask questions of particular organization that might be sitting in a parking Fcility you would not be able to assess it.,164,,
714,0.97,4138.567,4147.309,"Now I believe parks puts up the information, Jesus.",164,,
715,0.97,4147.309,4151.647,Where people can partake in the.,164,,
716,0.97,4151.647,4158.921,We really tried hard and enduring some lawsuits but I think we're okay now.,165,,
717,0.97,4158.921,4159.922,Yes.,166,,
718,0.97,4159.922,4166.128,Is there any other discussion from the potential or my colleagues before I move this.,167,,
719,0.97,4166.128,4168.13,"No, okay I will move forward then.",167,,
720,0.97,4168.13,4185.414,If there's no further discussion we will vote on amending Council bill 119746 attachment one substituting version one for 1 B. will the clerk please move the roll on the proposed substitute.,167,,
