34,0.97,277.276,288.788,"I am Commenting on CB 120153, the bill to establish alternative building establishments in downtown mixed residential zones.",7,,
35,0.97,288.788,291.691,"You may predict what I have to say, but I hope you consider it.",7,,
36,0.97,291.691,299.432,This bill creates environmental and human health consequences that need to be thoroughly Vetted and studied for conditional usage.,7,,
37,0.97,299.432,305.972,That issue is the loss of light two adjacent buildings and neighborhood streets.,7,,
38,0.97,305.972,310.61,Current building code provides for graduated upper level setbacks.,7,,
39,0.97,310.61,314.113,These are things that people need for their physical and mental health.,7,,

41,0.97,324.557,330.93,They block plenty of light in adjacent buildings.,7,,
42,0.97,330.93,339.572,I live in the building next to such a proposal were half the people in our building and one third in another residential building will be severely impacted.,7,,
43,0.97,339.572,343.843,Then there is the environmental impacts.,7,,
44,0.97,343.843,348.781,Sdci reports downtown residential construction is at 95% of capacity projected in the last major update.,7,,
45,0.97,348.781,352.485,We have not studied the impacts of more density.,7,,
46,0.97,352.485,353.753,But we have seen the evidence.,7,,
47,0.97,353.753,362.628,The heat map the seasonally city recently produced is equivalent to downtown industrial areas.,7,,
48,0.97,362.628,378.077,"This is due to dense development and lack of tree coverage for by allowing every small downtown block to achieve maximum density to 145 to 280 feet, it will not produce livable areas downtown.",7,,
49,0.97,378.077,382.181,It will do the opposite.,7,,
50,0.97,382.181,393.993,Displaced monetary gains without protections for human and environmental health.,7,,

55,0.97,404.737,413.613,There are no more public comments registrants.,8,,
56,0.97,413.613,425.658,"Thank you seeing as we have no additional speakers present, we will move on to the next agenda item.",9,,
57,0.97,425.658,433.266,Please read the abbreviated title into the record of the first item.,9,,
58,0.97,433.266,451.551,"Cb 120121, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning; adopting interim provisions by amending sections 23.76.004, 23.76.006, and 23.76.032 of, and adding a new section 23.42.041 to, the Seattle municipal code to facilitate occupancy of Street- level spaces downtown during the Covid-19 civil emergency.",10,,
59,0.97,451.551,456.255,We are joined by members to answer questions.,11,,
60,0.97,456.255,460.76,Can you kickoff the overview of the legislation and amendments?,11,,
61,0.97,460.76,466.265,I understand that there are slides responding to Councilmember questions from the last meeting.,11,,
62,0.97,466.265,469.569,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",12,,
63,0.97,469.569,478.377,I will briefly remind the committee what CB 120121 would do and the preview for potential amendments.,12,,
64,0.97,478.377,497.597,"As the committee will will call, CB 120121 would not--would modify Street-Level uses to generate pedestrian interest, encourage pedestrian activity, and strengthen connections between functional areas downtown.",12,,
65,0.97,497.597,498.998,How is that implemented?,12,,
66,0.97,498.998,507.039,It is implemented through Street-Level use development standards that prescribe activating Street-Level uses.,12,,
67,0.97,507.039,516.315,Cb 120121 would expand the list of uses that are authorized on an interim basis for up to one year.,12,,
68,0.97,516.315,529.629,It would be enacted under the authority that allows local governments to put in place interim development controls.,12,,
69,0.97,529.629,548.381,"Proposed additional uses would include food processing and Craftwork, accessory spaces to downtown residential towers and lodging uses, and other activating Street-Level uses that otherwise would not be allowed under current regulations.",12,,
70,0.97,548.381,561.894,"The bill would authorize the Sdci director to admit a type I decision, so we decision not subject to public comment.",12,,
71,0.97,561.894,566.432,It increases pedestrian activity and also increases the range of services downtown.,12,,
72,0.97,566.432,583.849,It would reserve to the deal when director the authority to make decisions on uses around Pioneer square.,12,,
73,0.97,584.25,597.93,"They could also be existing uses along the area as long as that use is around . So entities that want to take advantage of development standards, we need to enter into leases.",12,,
74,0.97,597.93,605.905,It makes sense to not have those uses expire when the regulations expire.,12,,
75,0.97,605.905,622.288,It would exempt the owners of buildings who have participated in bonus programs like the mandatory housing Affordability program or other regulatory programs that preceded Nha.,12,,
76,0.97,623.923,638.337,"It would also authorize legislation . There are four amendments proposed by committee members, one by the chair and three by Councilmember Lewis.",12,,
77,0.97,638.337,657.69,The housekeeping amendment by the Council would be about Coronavirus spread and modify six section after the apartments.,12,,
78,0.97,657.69,658.858,Councilmember Lewis has three amendments.,12,,
79,0.97,658.858,663.663,He has an amendment that would expand the area where the Iterative controls apply to the South Lake Union zone.,12,,
80,0.97,663.663,670.403,"That is off of Riley street, the area more or less across from the park.",12,,
81,0.97,670.403,673.472,It would also make some corresponding changes to the findings to support that change.,12,,
82,0.97,673.472,690.122,The second amendment would add office with footage and light manufacturing as uses and remove certain limitations.,12,,
83,0.97,690.122,702.935,There is a definition about manufacturing that I can go into when the committee takes up this proposed amendment.,12,,
84,0.97,702.935,711.911,"Finally, the third amendment by Councilmember Lewis would authorize the director to make administrative decisions about authorizing and conditioning uses at the Street-Level.",12,,
85,0.97,711.911,713.512,Those are the potential uses.,12,,
86,0.97,713.512,724.09,I think Opcd and Sdci have a presentation on the response use in question and request from the last committee meeting.,12,,
87,0.97,724.09,725.725,"Thank you, Mr. Freeman.",13,,
88,0.97,725.725,732.231,I seem not to with us--mad the with us.,13,,
89,0.97,732.231,742.541,-- Magda with us.,13,,
90,0.97,751.851,763.662,We have had some productive work sessions and conversations in consideration of the amendments.,14,,
91,0.97,763.662,769.668,The presentation is to address those issues and considerations.,14,,
92,0.97,769.668,781.78,And then we can answer any questions that folks have.,14,,
93,0.97,783.649,794.393,"As Rico mentioned, a lot of this information we have put together in response to what was requested last time.",15,,
94,0.97,794.393,819.818,"Just as a brief reminder of the pertinent changes that we are hoping to pursue, and a reminder from last time, this is really just one approach to the need, a shared need in really filling these currently vacant storefronts downtown.",15,,
95,0.97,819.818,824.857,"With this code change, it is one approach.",15,,
96,0.97,824.857,828.027,It would be temporary for 12 months.,15,,
97,0.97,828.027,831.53,Then it would remain in% Perpetuity.,15,,
98,0.97,831.53,838.871,"This is a slide that we showed last time, which is based on the area that we were originally proposing.",15,,
99,0.97,838.871,852.051,This next slide is a comparison showing the area including South Lake Union . We wanted to offer a bit of information in terms of context.,15,,
100,0.97,852.051,866.699,"The uses, where the unit land use code restricts the usage is much more limited.",15,,
101,0.97,866.699,874.607,"There was also a community process, the urban design framework that really laid out in looking were to require Street-Level uses and what types of uses should be located.",15,,
102,0.97,874.607,879.378,Those are predominantly located among the half blocks.,15,,
103,0.97,879.378,894.894,"And also one point of information, the latest data from Dsa shows that the more active uses within South Lake Union are bouncing back, which is good to see.",15,,
104,0.97,894.894,904.503,Another consideration that came up being proposed is the office at Street-Level.,15,,
105,0.97,904.503,921.854,I wanted to pull some additional information to share in that there is currently a vacancy that is expected to remain above 10% with office use downtown.,15,,
106,0.97,921.854,924.657,That is until 2024.,15,,
107,0.97,924.657,943.442,"As Mike explained last time, one of the key differences between some of these uses and where we are drawing them from, which is the neighborhood districts and downtown, there is a difference in context.",15,,
108,0.97,943.442,950.582,"As we all know, downtown at South Lake Union, there is a variety of office spaces.",15,,
109,0.97,950.582,955.888,That is why we did not originally include that with the proposal.,15,,
110,0.97,955.888,965.998,"With that, I will handed over to Mike to explain a little bit more about the uses and to do a Walk-Through of some of the information that we have.",15,,
111,0.97,965.998,971.403,We showed this slide last time.,16,,
112,0.97,971.403,976.275,It is the proposed supplemental uses that are drawn largely from the neighborhood business districts.,16,,
113,0.97,976.275,978.811,"Let's look at the next slide, please.",16,,
114,0.97,978.811,993.592,"At the last meeting, Councilmember Strauss asked us to prepare a crosswalk that prepares and compares the different use allowances.",16,,
115,0.97,993.592,996.829,On this side of the table is this column of downtown uses that are currently allowed.,16,,
116,0.97,996.829,1004.203,"As was pointed out, they are exempt from floor area limits and various incentive zoning programs.",16,,
117,0.97,1004.203,1009.041,In the middle is the more expensive use of things that are allowed at Street-Level in the neighborhood business districts.,16,,
118,0.97,1009.041,1017.85,Highlighted in yellow are the uses that we borrowed from this list to propose to use to expand what is allowed downtown.,16,,
119,0.97,1017.85,1057.256,On the far right--as was pointed out--I am sorry?,16,,
120,0.97,1057.256,1061.56,I will continue.,16,,
121,0.97,1061.56,1061.994,Should I continue?,16,,
122,0.97,1061.994,1063.529,Are we good?,16,,
123,0.97,1063.529,1065.297,Okay.,16,,
124,0.97,1065.297,1067.132,I apologize.,17,,
125,0.97,1067.132,1070.068,Yeah.,18,,
126,0.97,1070.068,1072.07,I am sorry.,19,,
127,0.97,1072.07,1073.972,This is Councilmember Juarez.,19,,
128,0.97,1073.972,1075.874,Something is going on.,19,,
129,0.97,1075.874,1083.682,You guys kept freezing.,19,,
130,0.97,1083.682,1084.483,It is my Internet.,19,,
131,0.97,1084.483,1084.85,I apologize.,19,,
132,0.97,1084.85,1086.618,There was some sort of zoom interruption there.,20,,
133,0.97,1086.618,1087.386,Sorry about that.,20,,
134,0.97,1087.386,1088.854,It crashed for all of us.,20,,
135,0.97,1088.854,1092.09,"Connect it happened for me, as well.",20,,
136,0.97,1092.09,1093.459,I am not the only Knucklehead.,21,,
137,0.97,1093.459,1093.692,Great.,21,,
138,0.97,1093.692,1096.228,We are in the same boat today.,22,,
139,0.97,1096.228,1098.363,Should I Rewind a little bit?,23,,
140,0.97,1098.363,1102.034,"Yeah, I missed.",24,,
141,0.97,1102.034,1104.503,You may want to go back about two minutes or so.,25,,
142,0.97,1104.503,1107.806,The data we are looking at is the crosswalk of uses.,26,,
143,0.97,1107.806,1113.612,On the far right side is what is allowed downtown at Street- level.,26,,
144,0.97,1113.612,1115.114,These are exempt from floor area limits.,26,,
145,0.97,1115.114,1125.757,The middle column are the list of uses allowed in the business districts.,26,,
146,0.97,1125.757,1129.661,The ones that are highlighted in yellow are the ones that we have borrowed to expand the downtown list.,26,,
147,0.97,1129.661,1134.133,On the right is the cumulative list of what we are proposing to add to downtown.,26,,
148,0.97,1134.133,1148.347,"It includes the yellowed list as well as some additional ones that are suggested by the downtown Seattle Association and other constituents, as well as borrowed from some other parts of the code.",26,,
149,0.97,1148.347,1158.19,The proposal is composed of the yellow in the middle and the green.,26,,
150,0.97,1158.19,1161.86,That would expand the list of uses downtown.,26,,
151,0.97,1161.86,1180.112,We are proposing these supplemental uses in regard to how the floor area level exemption applies to you can pick and choose amongst the broader range of lists to help fill the vacancies that cannot be filled with the more restrictive set of uses downtown.,26,,
152,0.97,1180.112,1191.623,"I should point out that the way that exemption applies, it is just where the Street-Level uses are required.",26,,
153,0.97,1191.623,1198.397,75% of the buildings that face the streets are napped on the map that Magda showed earlier.,26,,
154,0.97,1198.397,1209.107,So to not make an Mha payment is limited to that space within a building.,26,,
155,0.97,1209.107,1219.518,You can pick and choose from any of the menu items here on the left-hand column and not have to make any sort of payment and be exempt from the floor area limits.,26,,
156,0.97,1219.518,1220.953,We are proposing to expand that list.,26,,
157,0.97,1220.953,1225.457,"Within that same space, you have more to choose from.",26,,
158,0.97,1225.457,1237.436,"Thereby, hopefully, fewer vacancies and more opportunities for active uses and drying people to downtown and more lively sidewalks.",26,,
159,0.97,1237.436,1240.272,I will stop there to see if there are any questions.,26,,
160,0.97,1240.272,1246.445,"I do have a number of questions, although it is more of a clarity of this table.",27,,
161,0.97,1246.445,1250.682,The one thing that jumps out to me is Horticulture uses.,27,,
162,0.97,1250.682,1263.362,"I know we had Horticultural uses, agricultural uses in the valley, we had to pass a law.",27,,
163,0.97,1263.362,1270.569,"When cows wandered south of 65Th, those farmers would get find.",27,,
164,0.97,1270.569,1273.739,Can you help me understand what is going on with Horticultural uses downtown?,27,,
165,0.97,1273.739,1286.985,"Horticultural uses are similar to, it is a nursery would be the most common form that would take.",28,,
166,0.97,1286.985,1292.958,The thought was that we allow that in another provision in the code that is intended to help fill vacant and UNDERUSED sites.,28,,
167,0.97,1292.958,1305.103,"Sometimes construction projects, when the economy is not good, which has been for a while, it can happen.",28,,
168,0.97,1305.103,1308.54,Horticultural uses were thought to be something that could be productive and interesting to put in there.,28,,
169,0.97,1308.54,1315.147,One thing that came up is the flower stalls that sell fresh cut flowers at the Pike place market and dried flowers during the wintertime.,28,,
170,0.97,1315.147,1326.725,"They may be able to avail themselves of a space in one of these vacancies, grow the flowers there, and take them to the market or do it right here.",28,,
171,0.97,1326.725,1329.528,I think a nursery is the most common outcome here.,28,,
172,0.97,1329.528,1344.343,"Maybe, not likely to be the most commonly used, but we borrowed it from another program that has had some success in the passed.",29,,
173,0.97,1344.343,1346.845,"Mike, I froze there.",30,,
174,0.97,1346.845,1352.984,Are we all back?,30,,
175,0.97,1352.984,1355.654,"I am not experiencing the freeze, but you probably missed everything I said?",31,,

178,0.97,1362.661,1364.996,I don't have any further questions at this time.,32,,
179,0.97,1364.996,1367.165,Colleagues?,32,,
180,0.97,1367.165,1374.473,"Seeing none, do we have more comments from departments on this bill?",32,,
181,0.97,1374.473,1375.874,Do you have more slides?,32,,
182,0.97,1375.874,1382.914,Please take it away.,32,,
183,0.97,1382.914,1409.875,"One thing to point out on this slide is that beyond the Land-Use legislation, which would provide more flexibility for filling vacancies, there are some programmatic things that are being done . Some of them more broadly, there has been a lot of collaboration with the office of economic development and Federal monies that are available to help people in the recovery as well as others in the various neighborhoods that are affected.",33,,
184,0.97,1409.875,1411.71,I wanted to highlight the permit support.,33,,
185,0.97,1411.71,1441.573,"At Sdci, we are looking at expediting permits starting with downtown, but also expanding out into neighborhood business districts and providing for a permit Facilitator who can help understand emergent needs, conduct survey work, prepare language materials, and be ready to facilitate small businesses getting into the spaces and hitting the permits that they need from Sdci as well as others like public health agencies.",33,,
186,0.97,1441.573,1453.652,There is an expansive health effort here that expands beyond the Land-Use issues proposed here.,33,,
187,0.97,1453.652,1454.052,Wonderful.,34,,
188,0.97,1454.052,1462.661,"Thank you, Mike.",34,,
189,0.97,1462.661,1464.462,That is what we wanted to cover.,35,,
190,0.97,1464.462,1465.764,I am happy to answer questions.,35,,
191,0.97,1465.764,1466.565,Anything else to add?,36,,
192,0.97,1466.565,1467.799,"I have a question, Mr.",37,,
193,0.97,1467.799,1468.266,Chair.,37,,
194,0.97,1468.266,1468.6,I apologize.,37,,
195,0.97,1468.6,1471.102,"I was trying to print all of this out, but I gave up.",37,,
196,0.97,1471.102,1478.91,"It is an interim provision for a building, correct, to expand the uses for downtown?",37,,
197,0.97,1478.91,1482.113,And you mentioned business and going to other neighborhoods.,37,,
198,0.97,1482.113,1489.688,Do you have to be an official D.I.A.,37,,
199,0.97,1489.688,1492.424,To take advantage of the expansion of filling in storefront spaces?,37,,

202,0.97,1503.201,1507.973,I just Texted my staff to make sure they paid attention to page 6.,39,,
203,0.97,1507.973,1517.983,List downtown is much more limited than what is allowed in business districts outside of downtown.,40,,
204,0.97,1517.983,1520.485,That is one thing that we would like to cure with this legislation.,40,,
205,0.97,1520.485,1523.822,Business districts enjoy a much broader list.,40,,
206,0.97,1523.822,1526.358,We don't expect that the land use code is the impediment there.,40,,
207,0.97,1526.358,1527.325,It is probably other things.,40,,
208,0.97,1527.325,1528.226,Right.,41,,
209,0.97,1528.226,1531.229,"But it is just a business district, right?",41,,
210,0.97,1531.229,1534.933,"Or self-proclaimed business district, a Bia.",41,,
211,0.97,1534.933,1542.44,This list applies where the zoning is with the pedestrian designation.,42,,

222,0.97,1593.558,1595.493,Each Speaker will be given two minutes to speak.,47,,

319,0.97,2006.904,2008.272,That is correct.,85,,

321,0.97,2011.809,2015.413,"Colleagues, any questions after Councilmember Lewis?",86,,
322,0.97,2015.413,2019.35,Thank you for Queuing that up.,87,,
323,0.97,2019.35,2064.962,"One thing I want to put a fine point on here is, while it is true that the South Lake Union neighborhood has potentially not felt the brunt of the Covid pandemic as much as some of the other core neighborhoods in the center of the city and downtown, it is certainly the case that the economic Ecosystem in South Lake Union has been very much disrupted by extensive stay at home working patterns for large solid waste Union--South Lake Union business tenants.",87,,
324,0.97,2069.767,2073.204,They would patronize other businesses in the neighborhood and go to lunch when they were working there.,87,,
325,0.97,2073.204,2091.189,"While it is not a neighborhood that is in quite as much of dire Straits as related to downtown, there is interest from the South Lake Union Chamber and other Stakeholders in putting some flexibility to this neighborhood to have some of these innovative opportunities to put different uses into some of these storefronts.",87,,
326,0.97,2091.189,2099.697,This looms larger than ever with delayed return to work schedules from a lot of large employers in South Lake Union.,87,,
327,0.97,2099.697,2110.608,Amazon announced they are delaying returning to work until 2022.,87,,
328,0.97,2110.608,2122.52,We could see throughout the fall expanded Street-Level vacancy and continued hardship for businesses in this area and interest in attracting new and dynamic tenants that can withstand this extended period of touching go return to work.,87,,
329,0.97,2122.52,2126.324,And then of course the surging of the Delta variant.,87,,
330,0.97,2126.324,2135.833,I want to highlight one important Carveout that my office put into this amendment after consultation with the Department.,87,,
331,0.97,2135.833,2151.048,"That was to Carveout some of the more flexible Street-Level use on Valley street, which will be the frontage that faces the park.",87,,
332,0.97,2151.048,2173.204,"There is a very strong public interest in making sure that use is going to be a dynamic use that is facing the park, one that is engaging with that open space and providing a lot of spillover out into the sidewalk and activating the streets.",87,,
333,0.97,2173.204,2187.385,To making sure that we aren't putting a maker space or light industrial or something in that frontage facing out towards the park is an important policy concern.,87,,
334,0.97,2187.385,2195.693,That is why we are carving out of this proposal to make sure we have I dynamic use in that storefront instead of something that is more static.,87,,
335,0.97,2195.693,2209.106,"Beyond that, it is certainly taking the other considerations for the flexibility in the downtown neighborhood and expanding them in this corridor.",87,,
336,0.97,2209.106,2222.653,I will emphasize that this is an amendment that was strongly requested by Stakeholders in the South Lake Union neighborhood including the Chamber of Commerce and community members.,87,,
337,0.97,2222.653,2228.626,It is something that has been requested by the neighborhood and something that we should adopt today.,87,,
338,0.97,2228.626,2230.461,"With that, I don't have anything else to add.",87,,
339,0.97,2230.461,2232.263,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",88,,
340,0.97,2232.263,2233.598,I appreciate the background and explanation.,88,,
341,0.97,2233.598,2235.433,I will be supporting this amendment.,88,,
342,0.97,2235.433,2236.867,"Colleagues, any other questions?",88,,
343,0.97,2236.867,2246.344,I have a question.,89,,
344,0.97,2246.344,2249.347,"This is why I asked the question during the presentation, because of these amendments.",89,,
345,0.97,2249.347,2260.057,"You don't have to be specifically carved out in this legislation to enjoy the expansion, the interim expansion of uses for empty storefront.",89,,
346,0.97,2260.057,2274.772,"That is why I asked, if your area is already zoned for business, you would be able to enjoy the benefits of this expansion for storefronts for other uses, right?",89,,
347,0.97,2274.772,2277.108,No one is barred if they are not in this legislation.,89,,
348,0.97,2277.108,2281.612,I don't have to do an amendment to put in different places.,89,,
349,0.97,2281.612,2289.153,"I am guessing, I understand, I understand Councilmember Lewis's constituency and I get it.",89,,
350,0.97,2289.153,2304.268,"I want to make sure I don't have to have 12 amendments for 12 neighborhoods that have businesses that are zoned for businesses to enjoy this, correct?",89,,
351,0.97,2304.268,2305.403,I believe that is correct.,90,,
352,0.97,2305.403,2308.506,"Mr. Freeman, can you correct me with my next statement if I am wrong?",90,,
353,0.97,2308.506,2316.514,It is my understanding that South Lake Union and some other places have more restrictive land uses than some other areas.,90,,
354,0.97,2316.514,2318.315,So other districts will be fine.,90,,
355,0.97,2318.315,2329.327,I did not want people to send me texts saying I don't understand.,91,,
356,0.97,2329.327,2333.331,"If they are more restrictive because of zoning, I understand why you would have the need for that.",91,,
357,0.97,2333.331,2339.804,"I don't want the public to say if we are not in there, we cannot use our storefronts and take advantage of this great legislation.",91,,
358,0.97,2339.804,2340.671,I wanted that clarification.,91,,
359,0.97,2340.671,2350.281,I had a couple of texts from people saying the amendments were not on the site.,91,,
360,0.97,2350.281,2353.217,"Why they are sending them to me and not the clerk, I don't know.",91,,
361,0.97,2353.217,2355.052,I just thought I would share that with you.,91,,
362,0.97,2355.052,2355.953,Thank you.,92,,
363,0.97,2355.953,2357.455,Thank you.,93,,
364,0.97,2357.455,2368.566,I am pulling up Legistar right now to check myself.,94,,
365,0.97,2368.566,2370.201,I am happy to share Info.,95,,
366,0.97,2370.201,2374.105,They were not circulated in time to be published.,96,,
367,0.97,2374.105,2377.541,They were sent to Councilmembers yesterday.,96,,
368,0.97,2377.541,2383.38,We will make sure to update Legistar with the appropriate information.,96,,
369,0.97,2383.38,2387.918,Thank you.,97,,
370,0.97,2387.918,2390.488,They will also be added to the agenda for after this meeting.,98,,
371,0.97,2390.488,2395.926,It is helpful that Mr. Freeman is showing them on the screen.,98,,
372,0.97,2395.926,2402.933,"Councilmember, I see Vice-Chair Mosqueda and then I will go with you, Councilmember Lewis.",98,,
373,0.97,2402.933,2412.309,"Thank you very much, Mr.",99,,
374,0.97,2412.309,2412.576,Chair.,99,,
375,0.97,2412.576,2415.012,"I want to thank Councilmember Juarez for raising that point, as well.",99,,
376,0.97,2415.012,2422.286,"I did not ask a question during the presentation because during the time between your last meeting and this meeting, I had a similar question related to Childcare.",99,,
377,0.97,2422.286,2423.754,We are talking about various neighborhoods here.,99,,
378,0.97,2423.754,2430.361,"I was worried that if we did not explicitly call out Childcare as a permissible use, we were somehow missing an opportunity.",99,,
379,0.97,2430.361,2435.332,I want to confirm that we are making additive adjustments here.,99,,
380,0.97,2435.332,2442.039,The baseline of what was allowable will continue.,99,,
381,0.97,2442.039,2446.177,"So if you don't see something like Childcare, it is already a permissible use.",99,,
382,0.97,2446.177,2447.878,I wanted folks to know that as well.,99,,
383,0.97,2447.878,2449.447,This is not all-inclusive.,99,,
384,0.97,2449.447,2451.048,These are additive pieces.,99,,
385,0.97,2451.048,2467.798,"As Councilmember Juarez was saying, we want to make sure that these areas downtown and now South Lake Union, these areas with more restrictive uses can take advantage of this legislation and have additional flexibility.",99,,
386,0.97,2467.798,2474.371,Childcare was already one of the allowable uses downtown and across our city.,99,,
387,0.97,2474.371,2474.972,Is that correct?,99,,
388,0.97,2474.972,2476.34,That is correct.,100,,
389,0.97,2476.34,2481.679,Childcare is an allowable use downtown and in South Lake Union.,100,,
390,0.97,2481.679,2489.854,"In neighborhood areas, it is not an authorized Street-Level use.",100,,
391,0.97,2489.854,2496.827,That could be the subject of further consideration by the Council if the Council wants to make that policy change.,100,,
392,0.97,2496.827,2499.33,Can I check on something then?,101,,
393,0.97,2499.33,2505.503,I was not allowed to do that amendment because the title here did not permit it.,101,,
394,0.97,2505.503,2507.805,That is right.,102,,
395,0.97,2507.805,2519.45,"The title does not cover 2347, which is the commercial chapter that includes Childcare.",102,,
396,0.97,2519.45,2529.426,I can tell you what I understand from conversations with my colleagues who have worked in depth on Street-Level use issues.,102,,
397,0.97,2529.426,2532.73,I am thinking of Aly here.,102,,
398,0.97,2532.73,2551.148,"Childcare was not included in part because not to restrict where those uses could be located, because it is often difficult to provide Childcare providers to meet the transparency standards with a level of comfort that they need to for their clients.",102,,
399,0.97,2551.148,2555.653,I will give you a couple of examples just to see if it helps.,102,,
400,0.97,2555.653,2569.5,"In the King County administration building, a lot of the windows there are blocked to keep people from looking in at the kids.",102,,
401,0.97,2569.5,2575.005,That is what the parents of those children expect.,102,,
402,0.97,2575.005,2581.679,There are some ways in which Childcare is not necessarily a great Street-Level use.,102,,
403,0.97,2581.679,2583.714,That is not to say it is impossible.,102,,
404,0.97,2583.714,2585.382,Some Childcare is that the Street-Level.,102,,
405,0.97,2585.382,2599.096,That was a consideration in excluding Childcare from Street- level uses in the update to the commercial code from a few years ago.,102,,
406,0.97,2599.096,2605.402,"Councilmember Mosqueda, does that answer your questions for the time being?",103,,
407,0.97,2605.402,2606.437,Yes.,104,,
408,0.97,2606.437,2611.408,"I may have some more work to do with you on this, Councilmember Strauss.",104,,
409,0.97,2611.408,2612.509,Let's do it.,105,,
410,0.97,2612.509,2615.145,I love it.,105,,
411,0.97,2615.145,2619.45,"Councilmember Lewis, do you have another comment?",105,,
412,0.97,2619.45,2622.753,Or would you like to wrap this up with final comments before we take a vote?,105,,
413,0.97,2622.753,2625.856,We can wrap it up.,106,,
414,0.97,2625.856,2639.67,The thing I initially raised my hand for was to make some Clarifications about the special status of downtown and South Lake Union that necessitate these changes . I think that has been well covered by your self and central staff.,106,,
415,0.97,2639.67,2642.94,I am ready just to vote on this.,106,,
416,0.97,2642.94,2651.081,Thank you.,107,,
417,0.97,2651.081,2661.759,"I moved to amend CB 120121 as is shown in, is it Lewis amendment two or Lewis amendment one?",107,,
418,0.97,2661.759,2664.862,Business amendment one.,108,,
419,0.97,2664.862,2672.903,I moved to amend CB 120121 as shown in amendment one.,109,,
420,0.97,2672.903,2674.438,Is there a second?,109,,
421,0.97,2674.438,2677.408,Second.,110,,
422,0.97,2677.408,2685.983,It has been moved and Seconded to amend CB 120121 as shown in Lewis amendment one.,111,,
423,0.97,2685.983,2687.451,Will the clerk please call the role?,111,,
424,0.97,2687.451,2688.285,Councilmember Pedersen?,112,,
425,0.97,2688.285,2688.886,Yes.,113,,
426,0.97,2688.886,2689.486,Councilmember Lewis?,114,,
427,0.97,2689.486,2693.59,Yes.,115,,
428,0.97,2693.59,2694.191,Councilmember Juarez?,116,,
429,0.97,2694.191,2694.458,Yes.,117,,
430,0.97,2694.458,2695.025,Councilmember Mosqueda?,118,,
431,0.97,2695.025,2697.695,Aye.,119,,
432,0.97,2697.695,2698.495,Councilmember Strauss?,120,,
433,0.97,2698.495,2699.43,Yes.,121,,
434,0.97,2699.43,2702.466,"Five in favor, none opposed.",122,,
435,0.97,2702.466,2704.635,Motion carries.,123,,
436,0.97,2704.635,2706.537,Now we can move on to the second amendment.,123,,
437,0.97,2706.537,2716.914,"I will share at the outset that I do have a slight concern about this amendment, specifically about office space.",123,,
438,0.97,2716.914,2718.715,I know my office reached out to your office.,123,,
439,0.97,2718.715,2721.719,They were only able to respond during the committee.,123,,
440,0.97,2721.719,2726.924,I have had no time to fully Digest that information.,123,,
441,0.97,2726.924,2730.227,I will start with it.,123,,
442,0.97,2730.227,2735.699,That is the very narrow section in which I still have questions.,123,,
443,0.97,2735.699,2737.034,Everything else looks good to me.,123,,
444,0.97,2737.034,2744.174,"Mr. Freeman, Councilmember Lewis, would you like to take it away?",123,,
445,0.97,2744.174,2746.477,I will jump in first just to give an overview.,124,,
446,0.97,2746.477,2755.352,Maybe I can make my arguments pitching for this once it has been moved in front of us.,124,,
447,0.97,2755.352,2757.254,"I will make all of my remarks now, actually.",124,,
448,0.97,2757.254,2768.966,This amendment would expand some of the new uses for Street- level use to include light industrial and office space.,124,,
449,0.97,2768.966,2771.735,That would be in the downtown and South Lake Union neighborhoods.,124,,
450,0.97,2771.735,2782.513,"For South Lake Union, with the Carveout of Valley, which would not benefit from these expansions.",124,,
451,0.97,2782.513,2798.195,"I understand some of the concerns that have been expressed by the Department regarding the lack of dynamism, particularly for the office space use, as something that is allowed at Street-Level.",124,,
452,0.97,2798.195,2810.707,"This is something that has come from talking to a lot of Stakeholders about the fact that they are seeing market demand for, in some cases, having office space as a Street- level use.",124,,
453,0.97,2810.707,2827.157,"I understand that the public policy advantages are more limited versus more dynamic Street-Level uses that will help to activate the neighborhood more than office space, which is a fairly static use.",124,,
454,0.97,2827.157,2836.767,I think there are advantages if a given Street-Level space is going to be office space or nothing.,124,,
455,0.97,2836.767,2913.11,"Certainly, if office base is competing with other more dynamic uses, I would hope that more dynamic uses would be given the opportunity to be a tenant is in all of our interest to make sure we are using all of the space in our downtown core to the highest degree and having the lowest amount of vacant space that is possible.",124,,
456,0.97,2913.11,2923.02,"I think that both of these options, expanding and allowing both of these options in addition to some of the other things that we are discussing would be desirable.",124,,
457,0.97,2923.02,2937.968,"Just to touch briefly on the light manufacturing component, one of the existing uses that is being permitted in the base legislation is Craftwork essentially.",124,,
458,0.97,2937.968,2944.942,So it would be light manufacturing that occurs predominantly by hand.,124,,
459,0.97,2944.942,2962.159,"This would expand to include light industrial, which allows some degree of machine assisted process to the point where it obviously isn't as noisy or disruptive or dirty as heavy industrial would be.",124,,
460,0.97,2962.159,2990.887,"It basically allows, and maybe Ketil can Queue up some better examples, but it would allow for maybe maker space's or 3D printing kind of things that are machine assisted . So maybe like leather goods that are not made entirely by hand.",124,,
461,0.97,2990.887,3001.231,I will turn over to Ketil to provide more technical feedback on this and then open it up for more discussion.,124,,
462,0.97,3001.231,3002.666,Mr. Freeman?,125,,
463,0.97,3002.666,3017.414,Another thing that this amendment would do is it would also remove limitation on uses accessory to lodging and accessory uses.,126,,
464,0.97,3017.414,3021.785,I want to make sure the committee is aware of that change.,126,,
465,0.97,3021.785,3038.168,"With respect to the office use proposed here with the street frontage limitation, this is a development standard that is true for pedestrian zones outside of downtown.",126,,
466,0.97,3038.168,3042.439,It is an authorized Street- level use outside of downtown.,126,,
467,0.97,3042.439,3045.575,Downtown is more restrictive.,126,,
468,0.97,3045.575,3055.452,"Outside of downtown, in pedestrian designated zones and commercial areas, office use is allowed with this 34 Street front limitation.",126,,
469,0.97,3055.452,3064.694,"With respect to light manufacturing, it has been allowed use in most downtown zones already.",126,,
470,0.97,3064.694,3066.196,It has not been allowed Street- level use.,126,,
471,0.97,3066.196,3072.102,"There is sort of, the amendment sheet has a brief definition.",126,,
472,0.97,3072.102,3085.215,"There are examples on the code, which I will reference in just a minute.",126,,
473,0.97,3085.215,3103.133,"Examples given in the code include Assembly, finishing, and packaging of articles from parts made at other locations.",126,,
474,0.97,3104.0,3107.204,"So electrical appliances, medical equipment.",126,,
475,0.97,3107.204,3118.648,"Julie manufacturing, toy manufacturing, things like that.",126,,
476,0.97,3118.648,3120.517,"Thank you, Mr. Freeman.",127,,
477,0.97,3120.517,3128.925,"Councilmember Lewis, I think this is a smart amendment with the light manufacturing.",127,,
478,0.97,3128.925,3130.527,I think that is a good idea.,127,,
479,0.97,3130.527,3136.833,"I am Agnostic on office space, because I have not had time to Digest the information.",127,,
480,0.97,3136.833,3147.344,"I might ask you just here on the record, real-time, would you be open to holding this amendment for a full council?",127,,
481,0.97,3147.344,3149.679,We can Digest that office space a little bit more.,127,,
482,0.97,3149.679,3171.268,"Yeah, Mr. chair, if you want to spend a little bit more time grappling with this, I am happy to hold this amendment for further along in the process just so we can maybe go over some of this and make some of the members of the committee a little bit more comfortable with it.",128,,
483,0.97,3171.268,3172.469,I think that sounds fine.,128,,
484,0.97,3172.469,3177.407,I think your example of Iga is a good one.,129,,
485,0.97,3177.407,3181.611,"I want to make sure, as you said, as well, that we have the most vibrant Street uses as possible.",129,,
486,0.97,3181.611,3185.916,I think your light manufacturing is a really smart move.,129,,
487,0.97,3185.916,3193.623,"Colleagues, do you have questions on the amendment right now?",129,,
488,0.97,3193.623,3196.092,"I will just weigh in that I agree with you, Mr. chair.",130,,
489,0.97,3196.092,3200.197,"I need a little more time on the offices, provided no more than 30 feet.",130,,
490,0.97,3200.197,3204.568,I don't have a problem with the light manufacturing.,130,,
491,0.97,3204.568,3210.24,I think it would be a good idea to get more information and walk it out to full Council on Monday.,130,,
492,0.97,3210.24,3212.909,That is great.,131,,
493,0.97,3212.909,3214.344,I am seeing a head nod.,131,,
494,0.97,3214.344,3215.812,Councilmember Pedersen?,131,,
495,0.97,3215.812,3217.414,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",132,,
496,0.97,3217.414,3224.821,I want to support Councilmember Lewis . I appreciate the outreach that he has done.,132,,
497,0.97,3224.821,3225.555,Thank you.,132,,
498,0.97,3225.555,3227.424,Great.,133,,
499,0.97,3227.424,3228.592,"Thanks, Councilmember Pedersen.",133,,
500,0.97,3228.592,3232.362,"Vice-Chair Mosqueda, please.",133,,
501,0.97,3232.362,3235.231,Thank you so much.,134,,
502,0.97,3235.231,3260.257,"If this is going to be discussed again at full Council, I think some of the things I would love to hear more about our how this conforms with the intent of the legislation that would be trying to encourage more people to be interacting with these storefronts, to have a more pedestrian feel, to have a lot of activity on our streets.",134,,
503,0.97,3260.257,3268.131,I worry about storefronts that may be fully covered if it is manufacturing or business offices.,134,,
504,0.97,3268.131,3270.066,The usually do cover up those windows.,134,,
505,0.97,3270.066,3274.204,"Those are some of the questions that I would be looking into, Councilmember Lewis.",134,,
506,0.97,3274.204,3275.572,"Councilmember Lewis, take it away.",135,,
507,0.97,3275.572,3285.882,"I think Councilmember Mosqueda's questions are good for Queuing up a discussion at full Council on this, particularly on the office space.",136,,
508,0.97,3285.882,3297.394,"As I went over a little bit in my initial remarks, I think there are, from talking to downtown Stakeholders, two things at play.",136,,
509,0.97,3297.394,3305.201,One is we want to create a more dynamic environment where there is a lot of interaction with Street-Level use.,136,,
510,0.97,3305.201,3325.488,"As I touched on, I think there is a secondary policy issue here that I think hasn't been addressed quite as forthrightly in the four corners of the legislation.",136,,
511,0.97,3325.488,3335.031,"I don't know that this legislation is necessarily designed to confront this as one of the primary purposes, maybe more as a tertiary purpose.",136,,
512,0.97,3335.031,3347.877,"As I alluded to earlier, there are some buildings that we just want to activate in some respect, regardless of if the Street-Level use is going to be dynamic or not, right?",136,,
513,0.97,3347.877,3375.371,"There are some buildings in the downtown corridor where long- standing vacancies and no use of any type, even a static use, is resulting in buildings becoming Eyesores, buildings becoming targets of graffiti . The results of that from then not been activated is there is sort of a deteriorating effect to the broader block.",136,,
514,0.97,3375.371,3388.084,"In a case like that, even though office space is not a dynamic use, it is still more desirable than nothing being at that location.",136,,
515,0.97,3388.084,3404.033,"Figuring out a way to structure a policy, and maybe Ketil can result on this before full Council, figuring out that in some circumstances, office space can come in as a last resort is sort of what my intention is.",136,,
516,0.97,3404.033,3405.902,I know this is more permissive than that.,136,,
517,0.97,3405.902,3408.938,This is sort of like letting the market decide.,136,,
518,0.97,3408.938,3413.81,Baby that would result in an unintended consequence.,136,,
519,0.97,3413.81,3415.178,That is what we are grappling with.,136,,
520,0.97,3415.178,3427.924,"To give it to the light manufacturing, though, Councilmember Mosqueda, I do think light manufacturing in some innovative cases could have the potential to be an interesting Street-Level activation.",136,,
521,0.97,3427.924,3442.238,"I think of things like, I know that Councilmember Strauss and I in addition to other similarities that are perceived by the public on occasion between us, we also both have the same type of briefcase.",136,,
522,0.97,3442.238,3466.529,"I think the factory in the Soto neighborhood where it is not a Street-Level activation, it could be where as you go up the stairs to get into there, you can look out and see their entire manufacturing area where they are putting together Filson Briefcases and other things.",136,,
523,0.97,3466.529,3486.115,I can see the potential of a tenant like Filson or something that moves into a space and big windows would open out to the street where the public can look in and watch the manufacturing process.,136,,
524,0.97,3486.115,3492.889,I could see how something like that could have an interaction with the Street-Level and create a more dynamic Street- level space.,136,,
525,0.97,3492.889,3504.801,I think there could be some potential with the right industrial to spell out and have that kind of effect.,136,,
526,0.97,3504.801,3507.036,I look forward to Queuing this up again at full council.,136,,
527,0.97,3507.036,3512.008,I have no objection to holding the amendment until that time or tabling the amendment until that time.,136,,
528,0.97,3512.008,3513.243,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",137,,
529,0.97,3513.243,3514.11,That was really well said.,137,,
530,0.97,3514.11,3520.016,"What I am going to ask colleagues, please convene with Councilmember Lewis before Friday.",137,,
531,0.97,3520.016,3531.361,I will have Mr. an walked the floor to make sure everyone is comfortable.,137,,
532,0.97,3531.361,3536.232,"I want to make sure that if we bring an amendment to full Council, that we do so in short order.",137,,
533,0.97,3536.232,3547.644,"I think Councilmember Lewis, your comments about Filson is correct.",137,,
534,0.97,3547.644,3552.348,You have to have the best.,137,,
535,0.97,3552.348,3562.058,One thing that comes to mind there is that we have an office space on Ballard Avenue that is used for office space on the Street-Level.,137,,
536,0.97,3562.058,3565.561,"It has not always had the most active, vibrant storefront.",137,,
537,0.97,3565.561,3574.871,They have just partnered with the United Indians of all tribes to have their store in the space.,137,,
538,0.97,3574.871,3588.484,"The office space, the architects share their store frontage with United Indians of all tribes to have their storefront there.",137,,
539,0.97,3588.484,3591.154,It activates that front area and allows for the office space.,137,,
540,0.97,3591.154,3595.692,There are some creative solutions that we can bring to that.,137,,
541,0.97,3595.692,3599.596,"Colleagues, seeing no further questions on this one, I will move us on.",137,,
542,0.97,3599.596,3608.037,Please make sure you have your questions resolved by Friday and Munich eight with Mr. an.,137,,
543,0.97,3608.037,3612.642,"Councilmember Lewis, would you like to speak to your third amendment?",137,,
544,0.97,3612.642,3613.209,Yes.,138,,
545,0.97,3613.209,3615.211,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",138,,
546,0.97,3615.211,3630.326,"This amendment, I will let Ketil go first on this amendment.",138,,
547,0.97,3630.326,3637.133,There are a couple of Decision-Makers about what Street-Level uses would be allowed.,139,,
548,0.97,3637.133,3646.075,"There is the Sdci director, would be issuing permits and change of use permits, potentially for most of downtown.",139,,
549,0.97,3646.075,3656.486,"Then there is the Department of neighborhoods director, who has regulatory authority over use decisions and Pioneer square.",139,,
550,0.97,3656.486,3662.525,"So by way of reminder, the International district is not included in this legislation.",139,,
551,0.97,3662.525,3663.092,It is exempt.,139,,
552,0.97,3663.092,3669.666,This proposed amendment would authorize the director of D.O.N.,139,,
553,0.97,3669.666,3677.673,To administratively make decisions about Street-Level use Dispensations through the bill.,139,,
554,0.97,3677.673,3679.208,It also limits some conditioning authority.,139,,
555,0.97,3679.208,3685.081,"It takes away authority to limit based on traffic, parking, and noise.",139,,
556,0.97,3685.081,3690.153,Those are not strictly speaking related to the scale and character of the pedestrian environment.,139,,
557,0.97,3690.153,3702.298,It allows office uses as an allowed Street-Level use subject to a percentage of the frontage for large blocks.,139,,
558,0.97,3702.298,3704.2,That is what reposed amendment three would do.,139,,
559,0.97,3704.2,3713.743,This amendment is informed in part by the Department of neighborhoods.,139,,
560,0.97,3713.743,3717.647,I will pass this off to Councilmember Lewis as the sponsor.,140,,
561,0.97,3717.647,3724.253,Does the conversation about office space from the last amendment bleed into this amendment?,140,,
562,0.97,3724.253,3735.398,"No, which is the--which is the mentioned--we just mentioned that allowed office space.",141,,
563,0.97,3735.398,3740.737,I will push that over to Ketil.,142,,
564,0.97,3740.737,3754.083,It seems like the policy issue is whether or not we should allow Street-Level use.,143,,
565,0.97,3754.083,3764.76,"If the answer is yes, then they hold true for Pioneer square and downtown, unless they are distinguishable for some reason.",143,,
566,0.97,3764.76,3772.368,Office development at Street- level may have a deleterious effect.,143,,
567,0.97,3772.368,3780.409,Recommendation is reflected in part.,143,,
568,0.97,3780.409,3782.011,I should I call it her recommendation.,143,,
569,0.97,3782.011,3794.924,There is a proposed modification to Councilmember Lewis's original concept that is reflected here.,143,,
570,0.97,3795.458,3801.831,"Sara, I don't know if there is anything you you want to say about how this may play with development at Pioneer square.",143,,
571,0.97,3801.831,3817.013,"Consistent with your comment, the language there in amendment three regarding Street-Level office uses in Pioneer square, that was developed in response essentially to amendment two.",144,,
572,0.97,3817.013,3825.121,And that was Councilmember Lewis's interest in expanding office uses generally.,144,,
573,0.97,3825.121,3833.329,It is not that the Department of neighborhoods is necessarily advocating for expanded Street- level office uses in Pioneer square.,144,,
574,0.97,3833.329,3846.642,"We want it to make sure that if office uses were permitted, there was some sort of maximum regulation that was applied.",144,,
575,0.97,3846.642,3873.469,"And just to jump in on this, Sara and Ketil, due to the unique way that Pioneer square is constituted, everything under this amendment would have this additional sort of administrative Gatekeeping.",145,,
576,0.97,3877.039,3881.277,It is a little distinct from our downtown neighborhood discussion.,145,,
577,0.97,3881.277,3895.925,The deal when director could withhold approval of certain things . is that correct?,145,,
578,0.97,3900.096,3904.734,I will ask Genna to speak more directly to this.,146,,
579,0.97,3904.734,3910.306,She is the one who coordinates the Pioneer square preservation board within the Department of neighborhoods.,146,,
580,0.97,3910.306,3925.221,"Genna, maybe you can speak a little bit to what goes before the board at this point and what is handled administratively and how that may change over the next few months depending on what happens with the emergency Covid protocols.",146,,
581,0.97,3925.221,3926.122,Sure.,147,,
582,0.97,3926.122,3939.335,"Right now, with the emergency legislation, I only review any use that is identified as a preferred use administratively.",147,,
583,0.97,3939.335,3946.142,Any other change of use goes to the board for review.,147,,
584,0.97,3946.142,3949.312,Was there another part of your question that I didn't answer?,147,,
585,0.97,3949.312,3961.557,"So wonder this legislation,--so under this legislation, it would be reviewed by you and others.",148,,
586,0.97,3961.557,3968.097,There are other decisions made under the boundaries of the District made by the board.,148,,
587,0.97,3968.097,3976.572,It is not a fully administrative process right now.,148,,
588,0.97,3976.572,3986.782,Correct.,149,,
589,0.97,3987.149,3987.683,Thank you.,150,,
590,0.97,3987.683,3988.484,That is very helpful.,150,,
591,0.97,3988.484,3990.219,"Mr. Freeman, can you help me understand?",150,,
592,0.97,3990.219,3998.327,"What I am hearing is that if Lewis amendment two, office space, passes, then that is what amendment three is for?",150,,
593,0.97,3998.327,4000.329,Or does amendment three have additional expansion?,150,,
594,0.97,4000.329,4006.936,Can you answer that question clearly for the record?,150,,
595,0.97,4006.936,4012.174,Amendment three is specifically to the Decision- making authority in Pioneer square.,151,,
596,0.97,4012.174,4021.517,This office expansion which is supply in the Pioneer square special review district.,151,,
597,0.97,4021.517,4023.018,It would not apply outside of Pioneer square.,151,,
598,0.97,4023.018,4037.633,"Lewis amendment two, which expanded the list of uses to include office, is only applicable in those downtown zones that don't include Pioneer square.",151,,
599,0.97,4037.633,4043.839,"That is mostly the downtown office core one, downtown retail core, everything north of Pioneer square and the International district.",151,,
600,0.97,4043.839,4048.744,"Is that clear, Councilmember Strauss?",151,,
601,0.97,4048.744,4053.749,This language in amendment three is specific to pioneer square.,151,,
602,0.97,4053.749,4063.259,It would not authorize Street- level use outside of the Pioneer square special review district.,151,,
603,0.97,4063.259,4070.099,"The second part of the question is, does this amendment provide other administrative decisions?",152,,
604,0.97,4070.099,4072.001,Or is it just office space?,152,,
605,0.97,4072.001,4081.777,"No, it would allow, there is a distinction here between Pioneer square and the rest of downtown in this bill.",153,,
606,0.97,4081.777,4091.687,There is a limitation on the kinds of uses that can be approved in Pioneer square.,153,,
607,0.97,4091.687,4093.088,There is broader authority for the D.O.N.,153,,
608,0.97,4093.088,4093.923,Director to approve uses.,153,,
609,0.97,4093.923,4098.494,They don't have to be the preferred uses that are identified.,153,,
610,0.97,4098.494,4106.936,They can include uses that are not otherwise authorized in Pioneer square.,153,,
611,0.97,4106.936,4108.604,The Sdci director is not subject to that limitation.,153,,
612,0.97,4108.604,4124.72,The Sdci director can approve uses at the Street-Level that might not even be authorized by the zone provided they meet the test of providing different services at an activated Street- level.,153,,
613,0.97,4124.72,4139.235,"As drafted, there are already stronger limitations on approving Street-Level uses in Pioneer square than there is in the rest of downtown.",153,,
614,0.97,4139.235,4140.236,Okay.,154,,
615,0.97,4140.236,4145.875,"Colleagues, do you have other questions?",154,,
616,0.97,4145.875,4156.252,"I am not sure, I support this amendment generally . I guess I still have questions about office space.",154,,
617,0.97,4156.252,4158.954,Councilmember Lewis?,154,,
618,0.97,4158.954,4189.285,"Just to jump in on this one, Councilmember Strauss, and I think Ketil did kind of answer this, but to put a finer point on it, I think that this amendment, this amendment gives a little bit more power to the Department of neighborhoods director to move things along that would otherwise the subject to getting bogged down in a board approval process.",155,,
619,0.97,4189.285,4206.202,"One thing that is Sorta different, I think, from the conversation about making office use a broader use in the downtown and South Lake Union neighborhoods is that there is that layer of administrative approval year from the Department of neighborhoods director?",155,,
620,0.97,4206.202,4220.182,"I would note that in most business districts across the city, we are getting bogged down a lot at office use at the Street-Level.",155,,
621,0.97,4220.182,4226.388,"In most business districts around the city, office use is an allowable Street-Level use.",155,,
622,0.97,4226.388,4235.965,"That is partly going back to our first conversation of why we are not discussing a need to amend urban village district zoning requirements, for example.",155,,
623,0.97,4235.965,4250.379,"I think it comes down to, do we want to give the Department of neighborhoods director the ability to administratively approve use requests for Street- level office use in the Pioneer square neighborhood?",155,,
624,0.97,4250.379,4258.053,Is the Pioneer square neighborhood more like downtown or more like a neighborhood business district?,155,,
625,0.97,4258.053,4272.568,"I think in some respects, Pioneer square is an interesting intermediary neighborhood where does have a lot of characteristics in common with downtown.",155,,
626,0.97,4272.568,4273.902,It bleeds into the downtown neighborhood.,155,,
627,0.97,4273.902,4279.008,"But also, in a way, it shares a lot in common with urban village business district hubs.",155,,
628,0.97,4279.008,4315.511,"I think what we are saying with this amendment, and I would like to pursue voting on this amendment today if you are satisfied, Mr. chair, just to circle back on it, these were changes that were requested by Pioneer square Stakeholders to get some more activities in the neighborhood that has really suffered during Covid.",155,,
629,0.97,4315.511,4327.923,I do think that some of the safeguards and protections in place and that intelligence--the diligence of the neighborhood makes me confident we will have a vibrant Pioneer square.,155,,
630,0.97,4327.923,4330.326,I think we should vote on it today.,155,,
631,0.97,4330.326,4331.16,Thank you.,156,,
632,0.97,4331.16,4335.531,I see Councilmember Juarez has questions.,156,,
633,0.97,4335.531,4338.333,"Ketil, can you Scroll down to see the final analysis box?",156,,
634,0.97,4338.333,4340.869,Yeah.,157,,
635,0.97,4340.869,4344.139,I am going to have a problem with this and I will tell you why.,157,,
636,0.97,4344.139,4355.484,"Councilmember Lewis, thank you for providing this.",157,,
637,0.97,4355.484,4358.554,I have the amendments labeled one through four.,157,,
638,0.97,4358.554,4362.458,"Yours a labeled two, three, and four.",157,,
639,0.97,4362.458,4369.665,"We have agreed to pull back amendment number three, which is your amendment number two.",157,,
640,0.97,4369.665,4374.369,This is just what I think.,157,,
641,0.97,4374.369,4376.905,"Obviously, this is why we have committee meetings and discussion and transparency.",157,,
642,0.97,4376.905,4389.785,I think that your last amendment is Legislatively at least connected to your former amendment.,157,,
643,0.97,4389.785,4397.793,"In order for the last amendment you have in front of us to make sense, we need to pass the prior one.",157,,
644,0.97,4397.793,4399.495,I will tell you why.,157,,
645,0.97,4399.495,4402.564,I was trying to catch up to some of this and get copies of this.,157,,
646,0.97,4402.564,4412.141,I have some concerns and some questions about giving you the sole authority to the Department of neighborhoods to make administrative decisions.,157,,
647,0.97,4412.141,4419.181,I'm concerned about what the scope would be and the timing would be if someone were to appeal.,157,,
648,0.97,4419.181,4424.319,I have some basic questions on whether it is 30 feet or 50 feet or the square footage.,157,,
649,0.97,4424.319,4430.459,Some of this just got the stuff at the last minute.,157,,
650,0.97,4430.459,4431.727,I am trying to catch up.,157,,
651,0.97,4431.727,4437.266,"I felt comfortable voting on the first amendment, because I did get that one.",157,,
652,0.97,4437.266,4439.868,And also the second one now that I have some things clarified.,157,,
653,0.97,4439.868,4449.878,"But frankly, I don't think, I don't want to abstain, because I think you deserve a full conversation about this.",157,,
654,0.97,4449.878,4452.347,I am not inclined to vote if you want to vote today.,157,,
655,0.97,4452.347,4455.15,I am not inclined to vote yes on your last amendment.,157,,
656,0.97,4455.15,4461.59,I think it is connected to the one you are holding for full council.,157,,
657,0.97,4461.59,4473.702,"I know the Council President does not like it when we walk on amendments, but I would support and have our office encourage the Council president and our colleagues to do this with these last two so we have some time with this.",157,,
658,0.97,4473.702,4476.371,I really agree with what we are doing here.,157,,
659,0.97,4476.371,4479.174,You want to reactivate all this empty space.,157,,
660,0.97,4479.174,4480.809,It is a big lift.,157,,
661,0.97,4480.809,4490.986,I just want to do it right and have the right questions.,157,,
662,0.97,4490.986,4493.555,"Right now, I cannot quickly, On- The-Fly, developed some halfway intelligent questions.",157,,
663,0.97,4493.555,4494.489,I will leave it at that.,157,,
664,0.97,4494.489,4494.89,Thank you.,157,,
665,0.97,4494.89,4497.392,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez.",158,,
666,0.97,4497.392,4505.801,I had started with the intention today to pass this bill out . It seems like we will have longer.,158,,
667,0.97,4505.801,4514.71,My second reaction was let's send amendments to full council if we can keep the conversation short.,158,,
668,0.97,4514.71,4516.912,It seems like there is more conversation to be had.,158,,
669,0.97,4516.912,4517.846,Councilmember Lewis?,158,,
670,0.97,4517.846,4527.623,"I am happy to give a little bit more time on this amendment, as well.",159,,
671,0.97,4527.623,4545.974,"I think for some of the reasons that I shared earlier, this amendment is distinct and separate from the other amendment that we have tabled.",159,,
672,0.97,4551.513,4559.454,"If we can iron out some of those questions, it may not be time-consuming at full council.",159,,
673,0.97,4559.454,4568.864,I think this has been a good opportunity to solicit feedback from the community and Tinker with some of these amendments to iron out the issues.,159,,
674,0.97,4568.864,4573.669,I am happy to hold this one to take care of some of the confusion.,159,,
675,0.97,4573.669,4579.207,And then we can vote on it on Monday if the chair is okay with that.,159,,
676,0.97,4579.207,4580.576,Vice-Chair Mosqueda?,160,,
677,0.97,4580.576,4585.581,Thank you very much.,161,,
678,0.97,4585.581,4591.186,"Mr. chair, I will defer to your process and what you feel most comfortable with today.",161,,
679,0.97,4591.186,4593.855,"I did want to signal my support for this last amendment, as well.",161,,
680,0.97,4593.855,4596.491,I appreciate the conversation.,161,,
681,0.97,4596.491,4605.033,"In case that helps with the future can discussions, I appreciate this amendment being brought forward.",161,,
682,0.97,4605.033,4607.703,Thank you.,162,,
683,0.97,4607.703,4617.112,"The position I am in is that if we vote this bill out of committee, we cannot bring it back to committee to make amendments on it in the future.",162,,
684,0.97,4617.112,4627.222,"If we were to vote it out today, that means that all of the questions have to be answered before this coming Monday.",162,,
685,0.97,4627.222,4633.028,Or we can hold the bill until September 8 and pass it out that day.,162,,
686,0.97,4633.028,4643.005,The reason I had hoped to have it pass today is that September will be a very busy month and there is not a lot of extra time.,162,,
687,0.97,4643.005,4652.447,"That said, from the conversation that we have had today, there is clear need for more discussion need a.",162,,
688,0.97,4652.447,4660.055,"Councilmember Lewis, you are coming from the right place and these are good amendments.",162,,
689,0.97,4660.055,4662.958,We just need to make sure that they are finely Crafted.,162,,
690,0.97,4662.958,4680.976,"Just to put a finer point on it, too, Councilmember Strauss, it seems that the main contention from what I am hearing is this concern about Street-Level office space and potential use.",163,,
691,0.97,4680.976,4685.881,That seems to be the consistent issue between the two amendments.,163,,
692,0.97,4685.881,4692.888,"If that is somehow dealt with, I don't think there would be an issue pursuing both of these amendments at full council.",163,,
693,0.97,4692.888,4702.13,I am not really sensing any other controversy surrounding these two amendments.,163,,
694,0.97,4702.13,4736.498,"I guess I would ask for that feedback now in open session so when we go back to worth with Ketil and my staff on this, we can Queue up everything that is a potential issue to community members to make sure that if we pursue this at full Council, that it is a quick and smooth amendment process instead of something where some of these issues like it Litigated again.",163,,
695,0.97,4740.202,4754.85,This might be a good opportunity to share some things . that might be better than feeling like we are putting people in a tight spot to vote on it today.,163,,
696,0.97,4754.85,4756.885,Sure.,164,,
697,0.97,4756.885,4757.752,Great.,164,,
698,0.97,4757.752,4762.557,Thank you.,164,,
699,0.97,4762.557,4764.159,"Councilmember Juarez, I saw you come off mute.",164,,
700,0.97,4764.159,4769.297,I agree with what Councilmember Lewis is saying.,165,,
701,0.97,4769.297,4770.866,I think it does go around Street-Level offices.,165,,
702,0.97,4770.866,4773.802,I don't think there is any controversy.,165,,
703,0.97,4773.802,4776.471,You can just brief was off-line and we will be ready to go.,165,,
704,0.97,4776.471,4781.61,I just want to make sure I understand what I am doing.,165,,
705,0.97,4781.61,4782.277,That is all.,165,,
706,0.97,4782.277,4782.878,That is it.,165,,
707,0.97,4782.878,4785.113,There is no big thing here.,165,,
708,0.97,4785.113,4788.116,We need to get through some of these questions and the amendments.,165,,
709,0.97,4788.116,4794.99,That was my main concern.,165,,
710,0.97,4794.99,4798.093,I don't see is going through some in depth conversation at full council.,165,,
711,0.97,4798.093,4800.095,I agree with what Councilmember Lewis just shared.,165,,
712,0.97,4800.095,4811.206,"Councilmember Lewis, what I will ask is that we will hold your two amendments, amendments three and four or Lewis two and three.",166,,
713,0.97,4811.206,4813.608,We will hold them.,166,,
714,0.97,4813.608,4828.456,"Let's work to make sure, and I will have Mr. an follow-up with everyone on Friday to make sure we are all in agreement so we don't have a long discussion at full Council on Monday.",166,,
715,0.97,4828.456,4839.134,"At this time, I recommendation is to pass the bill as amended with amendments one and two to go to full council.",166,,
716,0.97,4839.134,4852.08,We will bring forward Lewis amendments two and three maybe as just one amendment.,166,,
717,0.97,4852.08,4853.949,There may be changes that occur to those amendments.,166,,
718,0.97,4853.949,4856.384,All Councilmembers on this committee need to feel comfortable.,166,,
719,0.97,4856.384,4859.454,"Otherwise, we will hold that bill until September.",166,,
720,0.97,4859.454,4862.757,Does that sound like a good game plan to everyone?,166,,
721,0.97,4862.757,4865.193,I am seeing nods of yes.,166,,
722,0.97,4865.193,4871.366,I will move to pass CB 120121 as amended.,166,,
723,0.97,4871.366,4872.701,Is there a second?,166,,
724,0.97,4872.701,4874.669,Second.,167,,
725,0.97,4874.669,4876.638,It has been moved and Seconded.,168,,
726,0.97,4876.638,4880.475,"Mr. an, will you please call the role?",168,,
727,0.97,4880.475,4881.309,Councilmember Pedersen?,169,,
728,0.97,4881.309,4882.277,Yes.,170,,
729,0.97,4882.277,4883.979,Councilmember Lewis?,171,,
730,0.97,4883.979,4884.713,Yes.,172,,
731,0.97,4884.713,4886.314,Councilmember Juarez?,173,,
732,0.97,4886.314,4890.485,Aye.,174,,
733,0.97,4890.485,4891.386,Councilmember Mosqueda?,175,,
734,0.97,4891.386,4892.287,Aye.,176,,
735,0.97,4892.287,4894.823,Councilmember Strauss?,177,,
736,0.97,4894.823,4895.19,Yes.,178,,
737,0.97,4895.19,4897.292,"Five in favor, none opposed.",179,,
738,0.97,4897.292,4901.129,Cb 120121 is passed as amended.,180,,
739,0.97,4901.129,4906.735,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, for your amendments.",180,,
740,0.97,4906.735,4909.404,We will be back before full Council on Monday for a vote.,180,,
741,0.97,4909.404,4913.108,We took a little bit more time with that last bill than expected.,180,,
742,0.97,4913.108,4919.247,This next one is a briefing on CB 120153.,180,,
743,0.97,4919.247,4924.92,"Mr. an, can you read the abbreviated title into the record?",180,,
744,0.97,4924.92,4936.131,"It is related to land use and zoning, providing alternative development standards for small lots found in downtown mixed residential zones.",181,,
745,0.97,4936.131,4936.765,Thank you.,182,,
746,0.97,4936.765,4943.538,We are joined by the one and only Brennon Staley from the office of community planning and development.,182,,
747,0.97,4943.538,4960.455,"Running, would you like to take this away? Brennon, take it away.",182,,
748,0.97,4960.455,4963.358,Hopefully you see the presentation.,183,,
749,0.97,4963.358,4976.671,I'm here to talk about some proposed changes in the Dmr zones of North Belltown that are intended to help make it easier to develop on small lots.,183,,
750,0.97,4976.671,4985.88,"The issue is that in these zones in North Belltown, they represent a great location--sorry.",183,,
751,0.97,4985.88,4993.722,"Dmr, can you explain for the viewing public?",184,,
752,0.97,4993.722,4994.923,Downtown mixed residential zones.,185,,
753,0.97,4994.923,4998.059,We have a map that is about 30 blocks in the North part of Belltown.,185,,
754,0.97,4998.059,5004.899,"So close to downtown, a lot of amenities, transit, etc.",185,,
755,0.97,5004.899,5011.206,The challenge in building these areas is two things.,185,,
756,0.97,5011.206,5012.807,"One, they have a height limit of 145 feet.",185,,
757,0.97,5012.807,5016.478,"Once you get above 85 feet, you can no longer do what construction.",185,,
758,0.97,5016.478,5017.612,So it is more expensive.,185,,
759,0.97,5017.612,5038.833,"At the same time, we have development standards that make development impractical on small lots.",185,,
760,0.97,5038.833,5047.609,"There have been a number of advances on innovative construction that make it much easier to build to these heights, things like modular construction where you build the boxes Off-Site and stack them.",185,,
761,0.97,5047.609,5052.147,"On the left, that picture is a modular construction project downtown.",185,,
762,0.97,5052.147,5060.355,"But also, panelized construction where you build a grid out of metal and have Premade panels that you insert into it.",185,,
763,0.97,5060.355,5071.166,"On the right, you can see some examples of that panelized construction.",185,,
764,0.97,5071.166,5082.31,Both of these types of construction actually have the possibility to help bring down costs and time and could be very helpful in this particular setting of these Dmr zones in Belltown.,185,,
765,0.97,5082.31,5086.981,It is good for heights above 85 feet and less than 160 feet.,185,,
766,0.97,5086.981,5094.589,They are useful on small lots.,185,,
767,0.97,5094.589,5096.624,The also require building shapes that allow for stacking of units.,185,,
768,0.97,5096.624,5100.728,You can think of them like Lego pieces.,185,,
769,0.97,5100.728,5104.699,It needs a little bit more of that simpler building shape.,185,,
770,0.97,5104.699,5112.04,"And of course, these types of constructions can make it faster and more sustainable.",185,,
771,0.97,5112.04,5116.044,They use fewer materials to construct.,185,,
772,0.97,5116.044,5129.724,"There are local manufacturers that are building in water use and solar panels so that they have a lot of opportunity there, as well.",185,,
773,0.97,5129.724,5132.627,"I should also point out that there is another type, cross laminated timber.",185,,
774,0.97,5132.627,5136.331,"At this point, we are not seeing people do that yet.",185,,
775,0.97,5136.331,5148.243,"We think in the long term that could also become another type of innovative construction that could be very useful, as well.",185,,
776,0.97,5148.243,5152.046,"It does not have the same issues with stacking, but would benefit from having a simple shape.",185,,
777,0.97,5152.046,5154.849,That is the context.,185,,
778,0.97,5154.849,5178.172,The intended goal of this legislation is simply to create more appropriate development standards for small lots in order to create additional housing in Belltown generally and to support these new types of innovative construction that can bring down costs and meet environmental goals.,185,,
779,0.97,5178.172,5181.676,How do we develop this proposal?,185,,
780,0.97,5181.676,5188.716,We started this with initial conversations with builders in early 2019.,185,,
781,0.97,5188.716,5196.09,Builders were finding a lot of areas of barriers in this area in particular.,185,,
782,0.97,5196.09,5209.404,"Belltown community Council, downtown business Association, Denny Triangle neighborhood Association, the downtown Seattle Association, some local developers, and some local property owners were met with.",185,,
783,0.97,5209.404,5217.445,"We released our state environmental policy act, as well.",185,,
784,0.97,5217.445,5222.417,The project was put on hold due to the pandemic.,185,,
785,0.97,5222.417,5234.462,"The proposal has not changed for more than a year, but it was put on hold because of other priorities during that period.",185,,
786,0.97,5234.462,5244.939,"Of where this would apply, this would apply in the downtown mixed residential zones of downtown, areas that have height limits of 145 feet.",185,,
787,0.97,5244.939,5252.213,You can see the areas in gray on this map are the areas where this would apply.,185,,
788,0.97,5252.213,5258.786,This includes about 33 blocks in this northern portion.,185,,
789,0.97,5258.786,5266.361,"In addition to being in those areas, the sites would have to be less than 14,500 square feet.",185,,
790,0.97,5266.361,5276.371,"In Belltown, this area was built with lots at around 6400 square feet.",185,,
791,0.97,5276.371,5291.119,"It would basically be what we would call single lots or double lots, those one Single- family home lots or two of them put together.",185,,
792,0.97,5291.119,5293.254,The buildings would have to be at least 75% residential.,185,,
793,0.97,5293.254,5296.291,"In these areas, almost all buildings are residential.",185,,
794,0.97,5296.291,5302.03,But we don't want to encourage more office in these areas.,185,,
795,0.97,5302.03,5303.064,We want to encourage residential.,185,,
796,0.97,5303.064,5310.772,"On the map, you can see highlighted in colors all of the lots where this may be applicable.",185,,
797,0.97,5310.772,5315.576,The Orange ones are single lots and the blue ones are double lots.,185,,
798,0.97,5315.576,5320.515,"Again, it is 24 individual sites in this area.",185,,
799,0.97,5320.515,5326.12,We did do analysis of what exists on those sites today.,185,,
800,0.97,5326.12,5328.323,We were worried about displacement.,185,,
801,0.97,5328.323,5335.963,"As we did analysis, we found no residential uses of any kind on those sites.",185,,
802,0.97,5335.963,5337.565,We are not worried about residential displacement.,185,,
803,0.97,5337.565,5341.336,These are primarily one-story commercial buildings.,185,,
804,0.97,5341.336,5354.549,"If they are demolished, that could result in some lower amount of commercial . generally in these areas, not all of them, people generally build retail on the first floor.",185,,
805,0.97,5354.549,5359.687,"We could see more expensive space, but probably not less of it.",185,,
806,0.97,5359.687,5364.158,No residential buildings would likely be demolished because of this proposal.,185,,
807,0.97,5364.158,5378.005,"Brandon, do you know exactly what is--Brennon, do you know what is existing on these community lots?",186,,
808,0.97,5378.005,5380.675,You just zeroed in on something that is incredibly important.,186,,
809,0.97,5380.675,5384.512,We need more residential space downtown.,186,,
810,0.97,5384.512,5400.094,The reason that downtown feels empty right now is because we have an Overabundance of office space and an under abundance of residential.,186,,
811,0.97,5400.094,5407.935,Bringing more people downtown will make downtown thrive.,186,,
812,0.97,5407.935,5412.006,This is not reducing residential to replace residential.,186,,
813,0.97,5412.006,5417.545,I think I heard you say it right before I jumped in.,186,,
814,0.97,5417.545,5419.68,Would storefronts be allowed on the first floor?,186,,
815,0.97,5419.68,5421.215,Yes.,187,,
816,0.97,5421.215,5425.72,"In all these areas, you could do retail on the ground floor.",187,,
817,0.97,5425.72,5427.021,"In some areas, it is required.",187,,
818,0.97,5427.021,5431.025,Thank you.,188,,
819,0.97,5431.025,5443.971,"The proposal itself, the idea is to allow housing development on these small lots in North Belltown.",189,,
820,0.97,5443.971,5445.64,That would be a slightly simpler shape.,189,,
821,0.97,5445.64,5458.352,"The idea is that by having a slightly simpler shape, it allows the for the stacking of units that would allow innovative construction techniques to be used and would make it much easier to develop on these small lots.",189,,
822,0.97,5458.352,5459.887,That is really two things.,189,,
823,0.97,5459.887,5474.802,"We have reduced the number of required upper-level setbacks currently, you need two brakes work at smaller.",189,,
824,0.97,5474.802,5477.705,We would reduce that to one.,189,,
825,0.97,5477.705,5487.315,We allow upper floors to be slightly larger while allowing lower floors to be slightly smaller.,189,,
826,0.97,5487.315,5490.618,It would allow for a simple shape.,189,,
827,0.97,5490.618,5497.225,It is important to note that the regulations are really unique in the city of Seattle.,189,,
828,0.97,5497.225,5506.2,"Other than one specific zone in South downtown, we don't usually require this complicated wedding cake shape.",189,,
829,0.97,5506.2,5510.938,This would be making the standards much more similar to other parts of the city.,189,,
830,0.97,5510.938,5515.209,"Something you just said, Brennon, that I wanted to highlight.",190,,
831,0.97,5515.209,5519.814,"There is no change to ratio or height, simply the shape.",190,,
832,0.97,5519.814,5524.652,Thank you.,191,,
833,0.97,5524.652,5529.624,I have four examples to bring home what that means.,191,,
834,0.97,5529.624,5535.93,"Right here, we have the most extreme example, a small lot that already has green Street setbacks.",191,,
835,0.97,5535.93,5539.834,You can see how the form requires those two different brakes.,191,,
836,0.97,5539.834,5542.537,It gets Skinnier.,191,,
837,0.97,5542.537,5553.247,"On the right, our proposal would reduce that to one break.",191,,
838,0.97,5553.247,5554.949,It would happen much lower to the ground.,191,,
839,0.97,5554.949,5556.35,The bottom floors would be Skinnier.,191,,
840,0.97,5556.35,5558.152,The top floors would be a little bit wider.,191,,
841,0.97,5558.152,5561.255,This is one example.,191,,
842,0.97,5561.255,5567.595,I have another example of what this means on another single lot that does not have a green street.,191,,
843,0.97,5567.595,5569.997,This will be the majority of cases in Belltown.,191,,
844,0.97,5569.997,5573.701,Development tends to go to the street anyway.,191,,
845,0.97,5573.701,5590.618,The differences we are proposing would only affect what would generally be in a light while on the other side.,191,,
846,0.97,5596.057,5599.694,The bottom would be different.,191,,
847,0.97,5599.694,5602.563,It would not affect what you see from the street in most cases.,191,,
848,0.97,5602.563,5608.102,"For green streets, we are only allowing those changes on the North side.",191,,
849,0.97,5608.102,5621.949,"Overall, this should not have a significant difference either way on the amount of light hitting the street.",191,,
850,0.97,5623.484,5625.72,"On these existing rules, nobody is building these buildings today.",191,,
851,0.97,5625.72,5629.223,"That is fundamentally the issue, that they are so complicated that people are not able to build them.",191,,
852,0.97,5629.223,5637.198,"These existing examples I'm showing you are totally theoretical, because nobody feels they can build them today.",191,,
853,0.97,5637.198,5643.771,The purpose is to allow development at all on these sites.,191,,
854,0.97,5643.771,5648.976,I have two more examples on a double lot.,191,,
855,0.97,5648.976,5655.549,You can see how it is a simpler shape with more breaks.,191,,
856,0.97,5655.549,5662.356,"On a green street, Similarly, you don't notice much change on most of the building.",191,,
857,0.97,5662.356,5669.096,The change occurs on how it is based from the building next door.,191,,
858,0.97,5669.096,5671.499,It is more consistent.,191,,
859,0.97,5671.499,5673.0,Great.,192,,
860,0.97,5673.0,5678.372,"Thank you, Brennon . colleagues, other questions for Brennon?",192,,
861,0.97,5678.372,5687.415,Vice-Chair Mosqueda?,192,,
862,0.97,5687.415,5694.188,I think changing code requirements makes all the sense in the world to allow people to build.,193,,
863,0.97,5694.188,5698.726,I don't think people see much changes in what you have shown.,193,,
864,0.97,5698.726,5703.698,"If we can build more housing and storefronts, all the better.",193,,
865,0.97,5703.698,5726.821,"Even though this legislation would allow for different types and alternative building models, including modules, that does not preclude somebody coming in and using a steel frame was using Union work on-site from being able to build to these new heights and new setback accommodations.",193,,
866,0.97,5726.821,5727.421,Is that correct?,193,,
867,0.97,5727.421,5730.458,Thank you very much.,194,,
868,0.97,5730.458,5734.829,It does not require a certain kind of construction.,194,,
869,0.97,5734.829,5737.832,I think any kind of construction would benefit from these changes.,194,,
870,0.97,5737.832,5743.437,Innovative construction is essentially not feasible under the current rules.,194,,
871,0.97,5743.437,5748.409,"We are not seen any kind of construction, either.",194,,
872,0.97,5748.409,5752.88,I also wanted to point out that these are optional standards.,194,,
873,0.97,5752.88,5759.053,"You will be able to continue to develop based on what is in the code, or you can use this if you prefer.",194,,
874,0.97,5759.053,5761.055,This should benefit all types of construction.,194,,
875,0.97,5761.055,5762.356,Great.,195,,
876,0.97,5762.356,5763.757,"Thank you, Brennon.",195,,
877,0.97,5763.757,5766.994,Any other questions?,195,,
878,0.97,5766.994,5776.47,Councilmember Lewis?,195,,
879,0.97,5776.47,5791.919,I am excited about this proposal as somebody who walks around the Belltown area on a regular basis and SEES all those Anti-Parking lots sitting there with a potential for development that is not currently being utilized.,196,,
880,0.97,5791.919,5793.721,I think this is a good strategy.,196,,
881,0.97,5793.721,5825.119,"I also want to briefly mention some of the potential climate benefits in being able to pursue, as was alluded to earlier, at a new scale and a new level and to Incentivize in a bigger way across laminated timber construction as a more viable option in the downtown neighborhood.",196,,
882,0.97,5825.119,5847.942,"These buildings have a way lower carbon Footprint, especially as we continue to see the truly dramatic impact that climate change is having on our region and the world, especially with this summer of unprecedented Wildfires in the West.",196,,
883,0.97,5847.942,5849.043,I appreciate having this conversation today.,196,,
884,0.97,5849.043,5857.952,I feel like we as a committee are moving forward a little bit on a new policy that has climate implications.,196,,
885,0.97,5857.952,5879.707,Every morning where we can do that as a Council and talk about that is a good morning to continue to move the ball forward on ways we can be more sustainable and do our part to combat climate change.,196,,
886,0.97,5880.941,5889.683,I want to follow that up with some other lower carbon intensive building strategies.,196,,
887,0.97,5889.683,5896.724,I think it starts with this proposal and this idea around small lot development and some of these changes are the first steps in that direction.,196,,
888,0.97,5896.724,5898.125,I am very excited about this.,196,,
889,0.97,5898.125,5903.831,"Well said, Councilmember Lewis.",197,,
890,0.97,5903.831,5904.265,Colleagues?,197,,
891,0.97,5904.265,5904.732,Any other questions?,197,,
892,0.97,5904.732,5917.845,"This will be back before our next committee before we take a vote . seen as we have no other questions at this time, Brennon, thank you so much for this presentation.",197,,
893,0.97,5917.845,5920.314,We look forward to bringing this up before our Committee on September 22.,197,,
894,0.97,5920.314,5927.054,We are finalizing the September schedule for both meetings now.,197,,
895,0.97,5927.054,5930.124,"If we are able to move that up to September 8, we will do so.",197,,
896,0.97,5930.124,5933.46,"Colleagues, September will be a busy month for this Committee.",197,,
897,0.97,5933.46,5935.93,I am highlighting that now.,197,,
898,0.97,5935.93,5937.931,"Brennon, any other thoughts you would like to share?",197,,
899,0.97,5937.931,5940.634,Thank you.,198,,
900,0.97,5940.634,5941.235,Have a good one.,198,,
901,0.97,5941.235,5943.637,Have a great day.,199,,
902,0.97,5943.637,5950.244,"Colleagues, is there any other business before the committee, anything for the good of the order?",199,,
903,0.97,5950.244,5960.421,"Seeing none, this concludes the Wednesday, August 11, 2021 meeting of the land use and neighborhoods committee.",199,,
904,0.97,5960.421,5963.357,Our next committee meeting will be on September 8 starting at 9:30 am.,199,,
