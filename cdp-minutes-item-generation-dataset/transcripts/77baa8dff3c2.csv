72,0.97,376.776,382.782,It was really tempting for us to just retire and just close down.,19,,
73,0.97,382.782,393.192,"My dad, he wanted to keep going despite all of that and just, not because it was his job, but to provide a service for the community.",19,,

134,0.97,788.22,801.934,Virtually all the horrible abuse muted out to the public by SPD officers has now escaped accountability as we are well past the 180 day mark for investigation and discipline.,26,,
135,0.97,801.934,814.847,"The Nesn learned by the SPD, if you engage in the abuse and massive infringement of first amendment rights, do so in an overwhelming matter which swaps whatever tiny bit of accountability the system even pretend to afford.",26,,

140,0.97,851.65,855.888,Only 100% civilian but investigations and discipline can guarantee community safety.,26,,
141,0.97,855.888,870.302,"The complete lack of action by the Council, and by Seattle's police oversight bodies guarantees more police abuse in the weeks to come as black lives matter's protests will resume with the conclusion of the George Floyd murder trial and the anniversary of his murder just weeks away.",26,,
142,0.97,870.302,871.437,This is on the immediate horizon.,26,,
143,0.97,871.437,872.371,How can you ignore it?,26,,
144,0.97,872.371,877.009,"As we approach the one-year mark, not to revert its promises.",26,,
145,0.97,877.009,883.482,The 50% or any significant amount of the funding once promised delimits weapons used by the SPD to abuse us.,26,,

160,0.97,971.27,975.908,I also urge you to not repay SPD for their excessive violent use of overtime last summer.,27,,
161,0.97,975.908,984.216,Council bill 1199 81 needs to be amended to hold SPD fully accountable for their $5.4 million Overspend.,27,,
162,0.97,984.216,995.227,Anything less signals a willingness to tolerate SPD's silence and is not the full accountability to which we need you to hold the police accountable.,27,,
163,0.97,995.227,999.498,Their cannot be police accountability without budget accountability.,27,,
164,0.97,999.498,1008.774,The $5.4 million of overtime spending needs to go instead to Participatory budgeting as you promised in December.,27,,

343,0.97,2097.595,2103.101,This bill is aimed at addressing the spike in hate crimes against Asian Americans.,47,,
344,0.97,2103.101,2112.844,"As a Third-Generation generation Japanese-American, I have watched my community grieve the deaths of the victims in Atlanta, and the numerous attack against our Elders.",47,,
345,0.97,2112.844,2121.953,"In my culture, an attack on our Elders is quite literally an attack on our history, language, and tradition.",47,,
346,0.97,2121.953,2128.659,"My Elders are the closest thing I have to my culture and heritage, and I take these attacks very seriously.",47,,
347,0.97,2128.659,2137.168,"However, weapon icing Asian hate crimes to bolster law enforcement funding, which will harm the black community, indigenous community, and Hispanic community, is reprehensible.",47,,
348,0.97,2137.168,2143.474,"While I understand the intent behind this bill, I'm appalled by how out of touch with reality it is.",47,,
349,0.97,2143.474,2148.779,I cannot believe that this would be introduced after the reckoning we all experienced this past summer.,47,,
350,0.97,2148.779,2156.687,"As you all well know, six Seattle police officers are being investigated for the January 6th insurrection.",47,,
351,0.97,2156.687,2167.865,"It is Illogically funding and outwardly racist Department to fight against hate crimes, when they Stanchion.",47,,
352,0.97,2167.865,2176.807,This bill will put money into the pockets of SPD before SPD has taken any accountability for their actions this summer.,47,,
353,0.97,2176.807,2189.02,"While six SPD officers are suing to have their names hidden, for attending an attack on the government, and while they continue to Disproportionally affect the law against black and indigenous people in Washington.",47,,

361,0.97,2217.148,2220.651,Hello.,49,,
362,0.97,2220.651,2223.554,I'm a valid resident and small business owner.,49,,
363,0.97,2223.554,2233.264,I'm calling in support of the massage parlor outreach project and Chinatown International districts request to reject 29.,49,,
364,0.97,2233.264,2243.24,Extensions of hate crime legislation spirit the Mayor proposed these items without talking to massage parlor outreach project for the Chinatown International district coalition.,49,,
365,0.97,2243.24,2255.319,"I encourage the Council to reject these unilateral requests by the Mayor, which Co- opt community organizations without consulting them and to listen to the request of the community.",49,,
366,0.97,2255.319,2268.599,"I also encourage the county to reject CB 120030, which potentially got the Jumpstart text by allowing employers to only pay tax on the percent of time the Seattle-based employees work in Seattle.",49,,
367,0.97,2268.599,2274.305,"This would allow companies to circumvent the Jumpstart text by having their executives work, or claiming they were, the majority of time outside of Seattle.",49,,
368,0.97,2274.305,2285.316,"If an executive lived in Madonna, and does 90% of her work from home, like many did last year, 90% of that executive's salary would be exempt from the tax.",49,,
369,0.97,2285.316,2290.388,Reject CB 120030 and preserve the Jumpstart text.,49,,
370,0.97,2290.388,2292.723,"Thank you, I yield my time.",49,,
371,0.97,2292.723,2296.961,"Thank you, next up is Emily, followed by David.",50,,
372,0.97,2296.961,2304.402,Hi.,51,,
373,0.97,2304.402,2305.403,My name is Emily Graham.,51,,
374,0.97,2305.403,2307.204,I am a resident of district 3.,51,,
375,0.97,2307.204,2322.853,"I am calling in support of the massage parlor outreach project and the Chinatown International district coalition in stating that while Anti-Asian hate is a huge problem that should be addressed, increased policing and a $150,000 police grant is not the answer to this problem.",51,,
376,0.97,2322.853,2329.36,Mayor Durkan and chief Diaz's the puzzle is not the solution the community wants or needs.,51,,
377,0.97,2329.36,2334.665,Community organizations were not consulted in making this proposal.,51,,
378,0.97,2334.665,2339.937,The Seattle police Department does not create public safety and we also last summer how little regard the police after the health of community members.,51,,
379,0.97,2339.937,2346.777,Expanding policing has been opposed by community organizations and the demand to be fund SPD still stands.,51,,
380,0.97,2346.777,2351.482,This goes in exactly the opposite direction.,51,,
381,0.97,2351.482,2355.186,Increasing policing will harm the very communities that the Mayor and police chief claim to want to protect.,51,,
382,0.97,2355.186,2360.458,Those communities have directly rejected this proposal.,51,,
383,0.97,2360.458,2374.872,"A more helpful solution would be to divert this $150,000 to housing initiatives in the Chinatown International district, or to use these funds for Participatory budgeting, which would allow the community to make their own decisions about their public safety.",51,,
384,0.97,2374.872,2378.709,I would also like to say I do not support any weakening of the Jumpstart tax surrounding work from home.,51,,
385,0.97,2378.709,2382.38,"I didn't know about that before this call, but would love to beat that drum as well.",51,,
386,0.97,2382.38,2382.68,Thank you.,51,,
387,0.97,2382.68,2383.614,I yield my time.,51,,

396,0.97,2424.755,2430.995,I would like to address the fact that we need to replace the interim police chief and have better trained police officers.,56,,
397,0.97,2430.995,2435.166,We still have a problem with societal Implosion.,56,,
398,0.97,2435.166,2440.871,The cops have Ardie exempted these people are destroying other people's lives.,56,,
399,0.97,2440.871,2444.341,Now you are expecting them to go out and do outreach for the sex work is.,56,,
400,0.97,2444.341,2450.447,They are probably intimidated by the their underworld bosses.,56,,
401,0.97,2450.447,2462.193,"I think we need a more effective idea of public safety where those who are making it unsafe still need to be addressed and may be sent on a different path, away from the local neighborhood they seem to conduct Uncivl war with.",56,,
402,0.97,2462.193,2469.166,"I also want to point out that with the American recovery money, we need to solve the homeless crisis.",56,,
403,0.97,2469.166,2479.677,"I think this city is willing and motivated enough, if they could understand that we needed 21st century housing, commercial, and school Buildout.",56,,
404,0.97,2479.677,2486.784,In all 50 States and territories to alleviate the oppressive choices in 20th century run down real estate.,56,,
405,0.97,2486.784,2489.82,That is shaking everybody down.,56,,
406,0.97,2489.82,2493.123,It is making it a living hell to stay at home and work for certain people.,56,,
407,0.97,2493.123,2500.998,"They are too close to the road, the bus stop, the FAA flight path, the train station, what have you.",56,,
408,0.97,2500.998,2503.434,We have a real concern where it has become modern third word.,56,,
409,0.97,2503.434,2508.739,I think we need better leadership especially at the police Department.,56,,
410,0.97,2508.739,2517.047,"Every time there is a concern problem, no copies going to respond unless you claim they got a weapon.",56,,
411,0.97,2517.047,2519.383,There is people destroying people's lives daily and listed nonviolent.,56,,
412,0.97,2519.383,2522.119,We see the Implosion.,56,,
413,0.97,2522.119,2524.288,I have witnessed predators all around the neighborhood.,56,,
414,0.97,2524.288,2527.625,They do not take no for an answer.,56,,
415,0.97,2527.625,2532.463,You've got to ball your fist up and go hostile to get them away from you.,56,,
416,0.97,2532.463,2537.768,There are vulnerable women who have been targeted by the police because there homeless because somebody called the cops on them.,56,,
417,0.97,2537.768,2539.536,"Then, they are refused services and outreach.",56,,
418,0.97,2539.536,2547.044,"Then, these evil kidnappers take them to these map houses and them and sell them to the underworld.",56,,
419,0.97,2547.044,2547.945,We need better policing.,56,,
420,0.97,2547.945,2552.149,Thank you.,57,,
421,0.97,2552.149,2559.089,I'm a resident of district 7.,58,,
422,0.97,2559.089,2564.261,I'm appalled that the city council would consider giving more money to SPD as a result of Anti-Asian hate crimes.,58,,
423,0.97,2564.261,2572.002,"$150,000 toward a new position within SPD is not what we want.",58,,
424,0.97,2572.002,2576.974,"As an actual member of Seattle's Asian community, please listen to us.",58,,
425,0.97,2576.974,2580.411,I know firsthand that SPD does not keep our communities safe.,58,,
426,0.97,2580.411,2583.18,I grew up watching them target people like my family my entire life.,58,,
427,0.97,2583.18,2591.789,"Not many people know his name, but SPD killed someone for having a clear toy Watergun and never received justice.",58,,
428,0.97,2591.789,2593.624,He was shot 19 times at Garfield community center.,58,,
429,0.97,2593.624,2598.896,"If you don't know his name, look him up.",58,,
430,0.97,2598.896,2601.932,He is just one example of SPD being harmful to the Asian community here in Seattle.,58,,
431,0.97,2601.932,2607.838,More money toward the police Department cannot help keep our people and the massage parlor workers say.,58,,
432,0.97,2607.838,2612.91,Police put more peer into our communities.,58,,
433,0.97,2612.91,2622.853,To use our pain and grief that we are experiencing as a community right now in order to get more money to a liberal murder is a slap in the face and truly Hurtful during a time when we are in an immense fear for ourselves and our families.,58,,
434,0.97,2622.853,2625.623,"Invest that money in our communities, not in the police Department.",58,,
435,0.97,2625.623,2627.791,We do not want more money for the police.,58,,
436,0.97,2627.791,2629.96,We do not need more policing to keep us safe.,58,,

652,0.97,3552.582,3579.609,"It is a direct result of the work that we have done through Rulemaking, led by Finance and administrative services, to better understand how the bill can be applied to payers, specifically adds an option for those payers to continue to select the current predominantly assigned calculation, or they could choose a method that would allow the businesses to allocate employee payroll expenses based on hours worked and Seattle in proportion to the employee's total hours worked.",147,,
653,0.97,3579.609,3590.787,"To reiterate, the business would be able to use the original methodology if it chose to do so, which I know many employees are in the midst of doing and have a preference of doing.",147,,
654,0.97,3590.787,3598.428,It also would allow for those employers who voiced interest during Rulemaking to be able to have an hourly ratio option.,147,,
655,0.97,3598.428,3613.743,One example that was raised was an executive who spends 10% of their time working in Seattle and 90% not in Seattle that somehow this amendment would mean that 90% of that salary would not be included.,147,,
656,0.97,3613.743,3616.546,"Actually, the opposite is true.",147,,
657,0.97,3616.546,3626.322,"If an employer had that exact situation chose to use the payroll hourly option, they would be paying on that 10%.",147,,
658,0.97,3626.322,3630.893,There are current scenarios they wouldn't be paying anything at all because it would have to hit over a 50% threshold.,147,,
659,0.97,3630.893,3636.366,It really does help us even out the way in which an employee earns.,147,,
660,0.97,3636.366,3645.375,Not undermine the initial investments that our Jumpstart payroll tax is going to go Fund.,147,,
661,0.97,3645.375,3650.48,It's also an important way for us to honor the hard work that went into passing the payroll tax.,147,,

672,0.97,3727.657,3738.434,Thanks to central staff . Thanks Council President.,147,,

843,0.97,4781.877,4794.089,I do want to just speak very quickly to the numbers for 2020 for reported hate and bias crimes reported to police in Seattle.,206,,

891,0.97,5223.451,5228.156,Instead we must commit to further addressing root cause of violence so we can achieve public safety for all our community members.,212,,
