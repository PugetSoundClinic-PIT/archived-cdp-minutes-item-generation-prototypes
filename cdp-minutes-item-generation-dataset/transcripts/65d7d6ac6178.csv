0,0.97,11.444,27.627,"Good afternoon everybody, this is the irregularly scheduled meeting of the Sustainability and Renters' rights committee of the Seattle city Council, today is Tuesday may 25th 2021 and the time is 201 P.M.",0,,
1,0.97,27.627,31.197,Will the Kirk please call the roll.,0,,
2,0.97,31.197,41.741,[roll call] four present.,1,,
3,0.97,49.015,60.26,I will also chair that Councilmmber Juarez will not be able to attend today and has been excused.,2,,
4,0.97,60.26,66.066,In today's committee meeting Councilmembers will discuss and hopefully vote on three Renters rights bills.,2,,
5,0.97,66.066,74.474,"First we will discuss the legislation from my office bending the school year Evictions of schoolchildren, there Emily's and educators.",2,,
6,0.97,74.474,82.582,"As I've said in previous meetings, housing has had a devastating impact on the education, development, mental health of young people.",2,,
7,0.97,82.582,91.724,The fact that children are evicted in a city with so much wealth is an indictment of capitalism.,2,,
8,0.97,91.724,102.802,But at the very least city Council has the power to stop children from being evicted for the school year and must absolutely use the ability to stop the school year Evictions.,2,,
9,0.97,102.802,104.204,That is what this legislation will do.,2,,
10,0.97,104.204,114.247,"As I have informed committee members and members of the public, the theatrical education Association voted on a resolution in support of this legislation.",2,,
11,0.97,114.247,119.319,That resolution passed with the overwhelming majority.,2,,
12,0.97,119.319,124.224,This morning Councilmember Peterson sent the amendments to the bill.,2,,
13,0.97,124.224,135.168,They will each show the scope of having fewer children evicted.,2,,
14,0.97,135.168,142.342,Unfortunately it was not until this morning that they sent out those amendments.,2,,
15,0.97,142.342,145.845,I want to make sure the public is aware of that.,2,,
16,0.97,145.845,150.416,"Any times amendments come out late, but there is no opportunity to develop them sooner because of the way discussions go.",2,,
17,0.97,150.416,174.14,"However in this case the bill has been discussed for over a month and I repeatedly asked all Councilmembers for several weeks including at the briefing yesterday morning to let my office know what commitments they are bringing so they can make them available to members of the public, especially struggling Renters.",2,,
18,0.97,174.14,184.017,"While my office has been able to review these amendments this morning, I am extremely concerned that Councilmember Pedersen has effectively hidden them from the public by holding them until the last minute.",2,,
19,0.97,184.017,192.225,I did post them to my Blog and my Facebook page this morning after we receive them to try to make them as accessible as possible under the circumstances.,2,,
20,0.97,192.225,208.308,Members of the public who are following along with this Committee at home and want to see them that Councilmember Pedersen has proposed you can see them on the Website Info.,2,,
21,0.97,208.308,229.329,"We will discuss for up possible load from my office in Councilmember Morales's office and cosponsored by Councilmember Lewis creating the right of refusal so landlords must offer their current Renters a new lease before looking for a new tenant unless there is a just cause, legally approved just cause to do so.",2,,
22,0.97,229.329,255.221,As I mentioned in the briefing meeting yesterday this is being jointly proposed by my office and Councilmember Morales's office and we have had from previous drafts of the Ministration and I repeatedly requested in public meetings that our office joins in one United bill and am pleased that this bill represents the United effort.,2,,
23,0.97,255.221,263.429,"I am hoping we are able to vote on this bill as well, this is a long time coming.",2,,
24,0.97,263.429,274.34,"I know from my own office experience over the last 7 1/2 years, and I know previous Councilmembers that are no longer in office were interested in doing them.",2,,
25,0.97,274.34,279.746,I know many community members and organizations have wanted to close this loophole.,2,,
26,0.97,279.746,294.994,This draft of the legislation has a right of first refusal for Renters to sign a new lease so their landlords cannot kick them out for no reason.,2,,
27,0.97,294.994,304.47,60 to 90 days before the end of the lease the landlord would have to offer a new lease to the tenant or present a legally allowed just cause for refusing to do so.,2,,
28,0.97,304.47,313.346,The Seattle Department of inspections is required to enforce that requirement.,2,,
29,0.97,313.346,317.183,I want to make sure members of the public are following because just cause can be quite misleading.,2,,
30,0.97,317.183,330.83,When it says just cause it means the landlord has the right to bring Eviction notices on a tenant only for approved causes.,2,,
31,0.97,330.83,336.002,"Approved reasons, approved by law and this has been on the books for decades.",2,,
32,0.97,336.002,343.943,"And when we talk about just causes, expanding the number of just causes is not what our goal is.",2,,
33,0.97,343.943,368.134,"Our goal is to make sure we minimize the excuses that landlords use to Evict Renters and tenants and therefore what we want to make sure, here in this case we want to close the loophole that allows corporate landlords and landlords in general that have tenants on fixed term leases.",2,,
34,0.97,368.134,378.745,The goal is for Renters to have the opportunity to be able to resolve any issues and get a new lease far in advance before their oldies.,2,,
35,0.97,378.745,392.992,Renters should never need to have to defend themselves or force to defend themselves in Eviction court against an unjust into their lease.,2,,
36,0.97,392.992,402.401,"Discuss your possible vote from Councilmember Morales's office which I support, creating Evicion defense for Renters facing rental debts that are rising during the Cobit emergency.",2,,
37,0.97,402.401,407.707,Councilmember Morales will speak more to that item on the agenda.,2,,
38,0.97,407.707,426.459,"Today is this committee meets, tens of thousands of Seattle Renters are on the edge facing the prospect of economic Eviction as Wrens resume their upward swing and corporate landlords take advantage of every opportunity to assert their power over tenants in our city.",2,,
39,0.97,426.459,430.296,All of us know Wrens and neighbors who have been pushed out of the city in recent years.,2,,
40,0.97,430.296,432.398,That is why we urgently need to strengthen Renters rights.,2,,
41,0.97,432.398,446.145,Just two months ago there was a historic breakthrough with the councils approval to the right to train one representation when their landlord seeks to Evict them.,2,,
42,0.97,446.145,455.021,The ranked to Council was built on the foundation of other grassroots in our years long movement to provide rights for Renters.,2,,
43,0.97,455.021,478.11,"That is how my office, organize Renters and community and labor organizations coming together have won many Renters rights for the last years including the fee gap and payment plan, the band on landlords raising rents, which has also been named after the notorious landlord.",2,,
44,0.97,478.11,480.48,Easier voter registration for tenants and the Eviction map.,2,,
45,0.97,480.48,487.787,"Each and every one of these took building a movement of Renters, activists and socialists.",2,,
46,0.97,487.787,500.266,"As I noted six weeks ago in the South Seattle Emerald, Renters must get organized to win just cause another protection against Eviction.",2,,
47,0.97,500.266,518.584,"As of this morning I am glad to report that accent 85 community members have signed the community petition demanding action to secure the rights of Renters, which is now the unified bill that Councilmember Morales and I are jointly sponsoring in which Councilmember Lewis has agreed to sponsor.",2,,
48,0.97,518.584,528.461,We will need a similar movement to win the full bill of rights for Renters including legislation that is before the committee today.,2,,
49,0.97,528.461,535.301,"Let's be clear that while all these bills address different parts of the Miscible court, they are all pointed in the same direction.",2,,
50,0.97,535.301,545.144,Putting Renters rights before the Profit-Seeking interest of corporate landlords and Prioritizing housing stability over Gentrification.,2,,
51,0.97,545.144,550.483,"In general, it is along the lines of putting people before profit.",2,,
52,0.97,550.483,558.257,Let's also be clear that these bills are not meant as fixes to patch over temporary challenges that have emerged during Cobit.,2,,
53,0.97,558.257,563.829,"For Seattle's Renters who contribute half of the city, the housing crisis was that even before Covid.",2,,
54,0.97,563.829,576.342,Four but 46% of dental Renters were officially paying more than 30% of their income in rent and one out of every five Renters were severely rent four.,2,,
55,0.97,576.342,581.047,Meaning they were paying more than half of their income in monthly rent.,2,,
56,0.97,581.047,587.853,"More than half of Seattle Renters were hit with Eviction notices, owed one months rent or less.",2,,
57,0.97,587.853,593.392,"In other words, people and financial dire Straits that are being targeted for Evictions.",2,,
58,0.97,593.392,598.097,Nearly nine out of 10 tenants were evicted wind up homeless.,2,,
59,0.97,598.097,603.069,And we know that the entire Eviction system is fundamentally racist.,2,,
60,0.97,603.069,618.484,"It is disproportionately on women, people of color, lack Renters three times more likely to be served in Eviction notice compared to other Renters according to the data from the housing justice project.",2,,
61,0.97,618.484,629.128,"As Seattle residents begin to recover from the pandemic and recession, they are experiencing landlords once again raising rates well above inflation.",2,,
62,0.97,629.128,646.545,"The analysis found that between January and April 2021, Wrens across the board in Seattle for apartments of all sizes increased by 9%, and annualized rate of more than 40%, putting rent on track to more than rebound in a very few months from the 2020 drop.",2,,
63,0.97,646.545,655.755,And continue during a Pre- pandemic prices levels.,2,,
64,0.97,655.755,665.264,"The landlords in 2021 ""Seattle real estate investors are continuing to enjoy a good investment on rental properties although Affordability continues to be an issue for local residents.",2,,
65,0.97,665.264,669.568,It does have a positive aspect for investors.,2,,
66,0.97,669.568,684.483,"Owning property in Seattle needs high demand and high occupancy rates ."" they are openly acknowledging the investors that are not in line with the interest of Renters.",2,,
67,0.97,684.483,696.062,It does corporate landlord Profit-Seeking practice that is part of the For-Profit market is what is driving this placement of Seattle Renters.,2,,
68,0.97,696.062,708.574,"We hope to stabilize housing by protecting schoolchildren, their families and educators and ensuring that people have a fair opportunity to renew their leases and stay in their homes.",2,,
69,0.97,708.574,713.312,And that Renters that have lost income due to Covid will not find themselves evicted.,2,,
70,0.97,713.312,726.058,They need to continue to fight for these bills and also the entire Renters bill of rights that we have been all these years.,2,,
71,0.97,726.058,731.53,It's all part of the new bill we announced in our rent control press conference a few weeks ago.,2,,

86,0.97,856.589,878.777,"I want to draw attention to excluding school workers that don't hold professional, this insinuates that teacher's aide's, and bus drivers are not essential to children's education and therefore not deserving of Eviction protections.",3,,
87,0.97,878.777,894.159,"The other three amendments, adding a close, allowing for landlords to continue to Evict children as they please and limiting the types of Evictions these Preventer also shameful.",3,,

140,0.97,1353.485,1363.962,I'm concerned today about your lack of awareness regarding Washington House bill 1236 which passed earlier this month granting just cause protection to tenants statewide.,16,,
141,0.97,1363.962,1366.064,An additional layer in Seattle would be redundant and confusing.,16,,

152,0.97,1442.04,1450.081,The city council is actively stoking a more restrictive rental market while excluding major Stakeholders in small housing providers.,18,,
153,0.97,1450.081,1455.353,The early impact of that city legislation were noted in the 20 18th rental housing study.,18,,
154,0.97,1455.353,1462.127,The counselor has fully ignored the primary recommendations of that with no follow-up outreach or analysis.,18,,
155,0.97,1462.127,1477.476,"I Re-Watched Video of the 2018 council meeting and was focused entirely on how to disregard the comments of 4000 small providers, none of whom have been invited to any meetings.",18,,
156,0.97,1477.476,1484.983,"You need to Collaborat with people who provide housing, you need regular reporting on the impacts of your legislation, thank you.",18,,
157,0.97,1484.983,1495.393,Go ahead Charlotte.,19,,
158,0.97,1500.365,1507.939,"Charlotte, hit Star six.",20,,
159,0.97,1514.813,1517.215,You are still showing up as muted.,20,,
160,0.97,1517.215,1527.759,You still need to hit Star six.,20,,
161,0.97,1539.371,1549.748,Charlotte is still muted.,20,,
162,0.97,1551.216,1563.662,Maybe we should go to Hanna and then come back.,21,,
163,0.97,1563.662,1573.872,My name is Hana and I'm a Renter in district 3. I'm calling to urge out all Councilmembers to vote yes on several urgently needed of Renters legislation.,22,,
164,0.97,1573.872,1581.112,First broad lowered by Councilmember Sawant and Mireles to close the loophole in the just cause protections for Renters against Evictions.,22,,
165,0.97,1581.112,1596.661,"Second, Councilmember Sawant's bill for families and School- age children and finally the bill from Councilmember morale is to defend Renters from facing debt or Eviction.",22,,
166,0.97,1596.661,1606.504,"Unfortunately, as just was said this morning, Councilmember Pedersen brought forward four amendments that would seriously weaken the legislation.",22,,
167,0.97,1606.504,1622.387,"One of the amendments is towards school workers that don't hold certified profession, talking about A.I.D.S., bus drivers, janitors.",22,,
168,0.97,1622.387,1626.224,"Last I checked, the people who make our school run.",22,,
169,0.97,1626.224,1635.9,Also I merging all Councilmembers to vote no on those dangerous amendments.,22,,
170,0.97,1635.9,1650.348,"Charlotte, are you able to Unmute?",23,,
171,0.97,1650.348,1651.349,Can you hear me?,24,,
172,0.97,1651.349,1651.95,Be my guess.,24,,
173,0.97,1651.95,1658.223,"This is Charlotte, in the last five years housing providers in Seattle were impacted by no less than 15 significant pieces of new legislation.",25,,
174,0.97,1658.223,1669.734,"In our group, the Grassroot landlords, we have a family with children that can pay the mortgage on House sale because the tenant is not paying rent.",25,,
175,0.97,1669.734,1677.742,And there is a 40% increase of the sale of rental properties in Seattle belonging to small housing providers like this family due to similar circumstances.,25,,
176,0.97,1677.742,1681.046,Yet housing providers have been excluded from the political process.,25,,
177,0.97,1681.046,1692.891,"This is a perfect example, there are three pieces of family significant legislation on the docket with only one minute for us to speak on all three.",25,,
178,0.97,1692.891,1707.072,"We have a meeting scheduled with committee members this week and next to share stories, data and legal opinions and we call for votes on all three of these proposals to be delayed at least 30 days so we can engage in the democratic process and for each item to be considered at a separate meeting to allow public discussion on each issue.",25,,
179,0.97,1707.072,1713.878,To do otherwise is undemocratic.,25,,
180,0.97,1713.878,1714.479,Thank you.,25,,
181,0.97,1714.479,1719.017,We have Matthew next followed by Jeffrey.,26,,
182,0.97,1719.017,1725.59,Go ahead Matthew.,26,,
183,0.97,1725.59,1732.764,My name is matt Smith and I'm a Renter in district 2. I'm very happy to see this United bill from Councilmember Sawant an Mireles to close the just cause loopholes.,27,,
184,0.97,1732.764,1742.44,This is one of a whole list of Renters legislation that is critical to pass in Seattle.,27,,
185,0.97,1742.44,1758.189,"I'm really happy to see Councilmembers continue to thrive in leadership on this, I'm also really happy to see this bill to ban school year Evictions, and I agree with previous speakers that this is something we needed 10 years ago.",27,,
186,0.97,1758.189,1759.724,So the Council should not delay on this.,27,,
187,0.97,1759.724,1767.065,They should pass it with the original legislation without the amendments by Councilmember Pedersen.,27,,
188,0.97,1767.065,1775.44,And we need to fight for more rent control and cancellation caused by Covid.,27,,
189,0.97,1775.44,1784.816,It is great but the Seattle Association education has abandoned this school year Evictions.,27,,
190,0.97,1784.816,1790.088,"So please pass this urgently, thank you.",27,,
191,0.97,1790.088,1794.392,Jeffrey followed by Max.,28,,

197,0.97,1815.78,1819.617,I'm speaking about legislation 12090.,30,,
198,0.97,1819.617,1830.094,First I want to point out that no one wants to Evict tenants but it is time-consuming and costly.,30,,
199,0.97,1830.094,1832.23,Landlords simply want tenants to pay on time and respect property.,30,,
200,0.97,1832.23,1835.7,Limiting a landlord to ending tenancy would lead to or just cause Eviction.,30,,
201,0.97,1835.7,1837.735,Think about that for a moment.,30,,
202,0.97,1837.735,1852.75,This legislation removes all motivation to work with tenants to resolve disputes . landlords will simply move to Evict enter just cause and with no point in waiting for the end of the lease but much sooner than they do now.,30,,
203,0.97,1852.75,1857.922,Those of us in the industry know that problem tenants are in constant violation of tenants.,30,,
204,0.97,1857.922,1866.965,"It's hard to imagine how earlier Evictions are good outcomes for anyone's, tenants, landlords or the city.",30,,
205,0.97,1866.965,1876.875,"I asked the committee to delay voting until all Stakeholders are brought to the table for more than one minute at a time, thank you.",30,,

211,0.97,1924.022,1930.728,"Hi, I am a member of several organizations and I am here to talk in favor of the proposals.",34,,
212,0.97,1930.728,1937.702,I was at forum the other day and they asked all the people that were there where they live.,34,,
213,0.97,1937.702,1941.806,When they got to the President Gonzales she looked really sad.,34,,
214,0.97,1941.806,1944.108,At this time she doesn't really have a place to live.,34,,
215,0.97,1944.108,1952.15,I thought that was a really good example of what it is like to be in a situation where you have to move.,34,,
216,0.97,1952.15,1954.652,You may have been in that same place for a long time.,34,,
217,0.97,1954.652,1958.323,Kids that are in school will have to move.,34,,
218,0.97,1958.323,1959.757,It is a really difficult thing to do.,34,,
219,0.97,1959.757,1970.068,And I understand what these small Renter organizations are talking about having a meeting so we can all discuss it.,34,,
220,0.97,1970.068,1975.173,But we only have 30 days left heard and I don't think in 30 days anymore resolutions will come up.,34,,
221,0.97,1975.173,1981.579,"I'm in support of this bill happening now, thank you.",34,,

229,0.97,2040.138,2043.641,"We are actually allies, we are not greedy profit Mongers.",36,,
230,0.97,2043.641,2049.213,"If you want to continue with affordable housing, please include us.",36,,
231,0.97,2049.213,2056.02,You have no idea how we operate or the obstacles we face.,36,,
232,0.97,2056.02,2061.492,"Outside public housing, landlords are about the only groups still offering affordable housing.",36,,
233,0.97,2061.492,2065.663,Your laws create unintended consequences like the actual loss of affordable housing.,36,,
234,0.97,2065.663,2067.932,"We are older, semi retired and depend on the rental income.",36,,
235,0.97,2067.932,2074.472,We love being able to provide affordable housing in our tenants are our friends.,36,,
236,0.97,2074.472,2087.952,"But the circuit legislation is forcing us to reconsider owning rental properties and offering these Well-Maintained properties and very, very low rents, thank you.",36,,

240,0.97,2108.473,2115.079,I strongly support Councilmember Mireles's bill as well.,38,,
241,0.97,2115.079,2127.425,And I am speaking against this amendment from Councilmember Pedersen calling on landlords that can be exempt if they are fewer than five.,38,,
242,0.97,2127.425,2133.097,I don't think that truly protects small landlords for the ones who are really struggling.,38,,
243,0.97,2133.097,2140.338,In fact many corporate landlords own separate companies and they pretend they are actually separate landlords.,38,,
244,0.97,2140.338,2150.948,So we can see right through that and it only ends up taking care of the big landlords.,38,,

249,0.97,2220.718,2231.829,Housing and the threat of Eviction also threatens critical Life-Saving emergency care.,39,,
250,0.97,2231.829,2238.803,This also commonly results from the spectra of financial hardship and homelessness.,39,,
251,0.97,2238.803,2248.045,The wave of Evictions will not only threaten the health of thousands of Renters on the precipice of homelessness but also Stymie health efforts to control Covid.,39,,

310,0.97,2797.194,2811.909,"For staff who have risked their health during Covid, apparently Pedersen wants to leave these workers and families out on the street.",51,,

318,0.97,2885.182,2893.357,Like other housing providers I cannot continue to carry this financial burden.,53,,
319,0.97,2893.357,2902.399,Many families like mine suffer the same and I support helping families with children that are most in need.,53,,
320,0.97,2902.399,2910.407,Small housing providers have been crushed by the combination of housing policies.,53,,
321,0.97,2910.407,2923.687,This follows a pattern of city council which is creating policy without considering unintended consequences.,53,,
322,0.97,2923.687,2944.608,"Hi, my name is James and I'm a staff attorney for the housing justice project and currently a Renter in district 4. calling in support of these bills today including Councilmember Mireles's and Sawant's bill that closes loopholes.",54,,

324,0.97,2961.158,2964.261,It makes it incredibly difficult for our organization to do our part to keep residents housed.,54,,
325,0.97,2964.261,2973.47,Throughout the pandemic I've seen landlords used no cause basis for Evictions such as Workarounds which would otherwise be unlawful reasons.,54,,
326,0.97,2973.47,2984.781,At the same way this loophole puts tenants a great risk of Eviction.,54,,

337,0.97,3065.095,3076.84,This legislation will help to address that balance of power and bring Seattle up to the standards already set.,56,,

393,0.97,3590.286,3613.81,"Pedersen's amendment is especially bad, it undercuts the whole point of the health provided by making it about No- fault Evictions such as renovations or making the tenant sign a declaration of poverty when we are talking about the children being protected, not the adults, that takes the focus away.",67,,

405,0.97,3720.316,3726.489,I really appreciate Councilmembers allowing me the time so we could cover all speakers even though it was just one minute for each.,69,,
406,0.97,3726.489,3731.227,I want to reiterate that my office has been and always is open to meet with landlords.,69,,
407,0.97,3731.227,3741.537,"And in fact we've been in touch with a number of lenders, including at least one that spoke in public comment and said we have not been meeting.",69,,
408,0.97,3741.537,3743.739,So that is actually not a fact.,69,,

410,0.97,3757.553,3781.677,Some of those who testified our truly small landlords and are struggling and I really appreciate Sonja from public comment saying that small landlords who are struggling should actually get involved trying to build for Renters rights and for those struggling to pay mortgage.,69,,
411,0.97,3781.677,3797.393,"But some who called in and said that they are small landlords like the Windemere vice president, I don't think that would be considered a small landlord.",69,,
412,0.97,3797.393,3807.804,So we need to be clear that the crisis facing Renters demand action.,69,,
413,0.97,3807.804,3817.513,One that describes himself as a landlord said they did not know about Councilmember Pedersen's amendment.,69,,

416,0.97,3832.028,3840.036,"But in fact, that is why I posted them on my Blog which is available for everyone to see.",69,,
417,0.97,3840.036,3848.044,"So you can see for yourself, as I mentioned.",69,,
418,0.97,3848.044,3863.025,"And I want to recall what Renee said just now, and now we will begin our first amendment on the agenda.",69,,
419,0.97,3863.025,3883.946,"Ordinance relating to the termination of residential rental tendencies providing defense to certain Evictions of children, their families and educators during the school year and amending section 22 .26 point 160.",69,,
420,0.97,3883.946,3899.562,"This is the legislation from my office, banning the Eviction of schoolchildren, their families and educators, it is common sense but there is also research evidence showing that when children are evicted it has a devastating impact on their academic achievement, developmental and mental health.",69,,
421,0.97,3899.562,3904.9,Imagine as a child trying to focus on your schoolwork while losing your home.,69,,
422,0.97,3904.9,3920.483,"For example, the aptly named losing home report found that of the respondents of School- age children, 85.7% said their children had to move schools and 87.5 reported their children's school performance affected very much.",69,,
423,0.97,3920.483,3930.66,In 2018 the state found that nearly 4200 Seattle public school children were homeless at some point during the school year.,69,,
424,0.97,3930.66,3932.328,That is a staggering number of schoolchildren.,69,,
425,0.97,3932.328,3938.134,"In practical terms that means in an average class of 30 students, too will be homeless.",69,,
426,0.97,3938.134,3944.84,This is a racial justice and black lives matter issue.,69,,
427,0.97,3944.84,3954.517,Black tenants are evicted at much higher rates than others and we also see the black students and other students of color disproportionately face homelessness.,69,,
428,0.97,3954.517,3971.967,"The 2018 state data found that 40% of homeless students were black and 23% were Latinx, even though they constitute for a much smaller proportion of sales overall populations.",69,,
429,0.97,3971.967,3985.281,"For the high school graduating class that year, the Seattle Pi found for the class of 2018, 55.2% of homeless students graduate on time compared to 85.4 percent of students that were housed.",69,,
430,0.97,3985.281,4005.134,"This is staggering data and of course as I've said before, the reason we are banning Evictions during the school year is because of the enormous link between Evictions and homelessness we found in studies that nine out of 10 Evictions result in homelessness.",69,,
431,0.97,4005.134,4010.272,Which is also staggering data.,69,,
432,0.97,4010.272,4014.61,"We know that housing stability has a devastating impact on education, developmental and mental health.",69,,
433,0.97,4014.61,4025.287,"We need to do something about this, and at the very least the Council has the power to stop children from being evicted which is what this legislation does.",69,,
434,0.97,4025.287,4033.129,I am really thankful that we have the city council central staff here to walk us through a memo detailing the legislation.,69,,
435,0.97,4033.129,4038.601,"Jeff, will you please introduce yourself for the record and then begin, thank you.",69,,
436,0.97,4038.601,4044.34,"For the record, Jeff, counsel such a step.",70,,
437,0.97,4044.34,4052.748,"Because the community has already heard some of the hills in the prayer meeting, I won't go into extensive detail.",70,,
438,0.97,4052.748,4075.371,"I will at the end briefly describe each of the amendment spirits of Council bill 1200 56, a covers who will be covered by this, all children under the age of 18, and then anyone that was a student as defined in the bill.",70,,
439,0.97,4075.371,4098.394,"Furthermore, anyone that has legal custody of a child and finally, educators which is defined broadly as anyone that is an employee or contractor of the school district, the Timeframe that this defense against Evictions would apply is the calendar that is set by the sale school district.",70,,
440,0.97,4098.394,4101.096,Currently that will begin the first Wednesday of September and extended until mid-June.,70,,
441,0.97,4101.096,4111.707,"So you you are looking at a defensive against Eviction that would apply to the entire year except for 10 to 11 weeks per year, over the summer.",70,,
442,0.97,4111.707,4118.414,"For comparison if you look at the winter Evictions bill, that was limited to about 12 to 13 weeks.",70,,
443,0.97,4118.414,4123.586,So who would be in when the defense against Eviction would probably.,70,,
444,0.97,4123.586,4127.256,There is a limited number of apply.,70,,
445,0.97,4127.256,4132.895,There is a limited number of circumstances in which it would be able to proceed.,70,,
446,0.97,4132.895,4136.265,The first is anytime a code violation occurred.,70,,
447,0.97,4136.265,4144.607,So our requirement to Remediate conditions.,70,,
448,0.97,4144.607,4151.714,So the unit is not up to standards.,70,,
449,0.97,4151.714,4162.224,"If there was criminal activity by the tenants such as operating unlawful business, then the defense against Eviction would not apply.",70,,
450,0.97,4162.224,4167.129,"Finally, just covering again.",70,,
451,0.97,4167.129,4180.075,"As a point of information, I think the recording stopped.",71,,
452,0.97,4180.075,4186.782,"Okay, go ahead Jeff.",72,,
453,0.97,4186.782,4192.454,"I will go back one point, just to make sure it captured everything.",73,,
454,0.97,4192.454,4198.761,I was covering the circumstances in which the defense against conviction Eviction would not apply.,73,,
455,0.97,4198.761,4209.805,"The first would be anytime there is a code violation, so a dwelling that had too many inhabitants were not suitable for living.",73,,
456,0.97,4209.805,4212.408,The second would be if the tenant was engaging in criminal activity.,73,,
457,0.97,4212.408,4224.92,"The third would be if it wasn't owner shared dwelling, in that case the owner actually is occupying it.",73,,
458,0.97,4224.92,4243.539,"For comparison because there has been a lot of parallels are drawn, there are two primary differences between the bill presented to this committee today and that that was passed in San Francisco.",73,,
459,0.97,4243.539,4245.374,The San Francisco bill only applies to No-Fault situations.,73,,
460,0.97,4245.374,4258.253,So a circumstance where a landlord would be able to plan around the renovation of the unit or selling or something along those lines.,73,,
461,0.97,4258.253,4269.965,"Similarly in San Francisco, the protection against Evictions does not kick in unless it's a tenant that has occupied for at least 12 months.",73,,
462,0.97,4269.965,4273.836,That is a minimum qualification.,73,,
463,0.97,4273.836,4288.884,"So that broadly, as the committee already knows I want to briefly go through a description of the four amendments.",73,,
464,0.97,4288.884,4305.868,"Jeff, just to organize the discussion if I might just move the bill before you, before you start talking about the amendments.",74,,
465,0.97,4305.868,4306.869,Thank you.,75,,
466,0.97,4306.869,4312.007,I move Council bill one 20046 for a vote.,76,,
467,0.97,4312.007,4317.112,Second.,77,,
468,0.97,4317.112,4320.416,"Thank you, go ahead Jeff.",78,,
469,0.97,4320.416,4332.328,"So the amendments, one would establish a time limit so that 18 months after the effective date of the ordinance, the defense of Eviction would no longer apply.",79,,
470,0.97,4332.328,4334.83,"So essentially, action would be taken to restore it at that point.",79,,
471,0.97,4334.83,4340.302,The second would align with the Dilatory code.,79,,
472,0.97,4340.302,4366.929,"Similar to teacher classroom instruction through the amendment would use the phrasing, a person who holds a professional certification and who is applied in a position where such a certificate is required whose primary duty is the educational instruction of students.",79,,
473,0.97,4366.929,4374.036,That is zoning in on the impacts of the students Well- being.,79,,
474,0.97,4374.036,4379.875,"The third would establish an exemption for small landlords, any landlord operating four or less units.",79,,
475,0.97,4379.875,4390.619,In the fourth amendment would largely move to what San Francisco has in place so that No-Fault Circumstnces would be protected.,79,,
476,0.97,4390.619,4406.268,"However, an Eviction could proceed if there was failure to pay rent was not complying with the terms for lease agreement or had to be given notice that those conditions or payment of rent had to be made.",79,,
477,0.97,4406.268,4413.308,There is a nuance to this bill I want to highlight.,79,,
478,0.97,4413.308,4419.448,"For educators, they would not have a hardship protection.",79,,
479,0.97,4419.448,4425.02,It would only be if it was No- fault protection.,79,,
480,0.97,4425.02,4430.125,"However, for children and their legal custodians.",79,,
481,0.97,4430.125,4442.137,"Prayer of regular problem receiver and, they could self declare ourselves certified that there had been hardship situations that prevented them from being able to pay the rent.",79,,
482,0.97,4442.137,4449.044,Therefore they would be able to raise and defense against Eviction.,79,,
483,0.97,4449.044,4455.083,I hope that was helpful and I'm available for further comments or questions.,79,,
484,0.97,4455.083,4469.565,"First I'd like to ask Councilmembers or community members, if you have any questions about the base legislation, please feel free to ask.",80,,
485,0.97,4469.565,4471.7,After that we will move into the amendments.,80,,
486,0.97,4471.7,4475.771,"So, any questions?",80,,
487,0.97,4475.771,4484.58,"I don't see any, so let's move to the amendments.",80,,
488,0.97,4484.58,4491.086,"So, all the amendments are for Councilmember Pedersen.",80,,
489,0.97,4491.086,4496.258,I will hand it over to you Councilmember Pedersen to talk about it.,80,,
490,0.97,4496.258,4512.407,I just want to say that I'm in agreement with you generally that these Evictions resent hardships for children and families and no one wants to have this disruption to learning loss and disability for children.,80,,
491,0.97,4512.407,4519.081,"I like to see more invention of Evictions, especially during nonpayment of rent during the Covid pandemic.",80,,
492,0.97,4519.081,4533.695,"I have voted in favor of numerous tenant protections during the past year including the winter band for Evictions of residents, free legal counsel for those in need in the payment plans for those impacted by the Covid pandemic.",80,,
493,0.97,4533.695,4544.539,Before joining city council I helped with a bill that supported tens of thousands of units of housing.,80,,
494,0.97,4544.539,4561.356,"I believe providing a more targeted, direct and efficient solution would be funding the tenant assistance for those in need rather than adding additional regulation at this time that could be legally challenged.",80,,
495,0.97,4561.356,4566.728,"Because, it leaves one party bearing the cost.",80,,
496,0.97,4566.728,4575.57,So funding rather than regulating would be my preferred approach.,80,,
497,0.97,4575.57,4577.472,However I see the importance of this legislation.,80,,
498,0.97,4577.472,4580.709,So my amendments are meant for discussion purpose.,80,,
499,0.97,4580.709,4592.287,I think it is important to have amendments at the city stage to allow to craft a couple of these.,80,,
500,0.97,4592.287,4604.399,"If it is okay with you, I will try to move each one and then we can discuss each one or have people ask questions, I can take it one by one if you'd like Madam chair.",80,,
501,0.97,4604.399,4607.269,"Yes, let's do one by one.",81,,
502,0.97,4607.269,4611.306,Do you want to go ahead and move it?,81,,
503,0.97,4611.306,4621.583,"Is, I would like to move to amend Council bill 10046 as presented in amendment one.",82,,
504,0.97,4621.583,4631.927,Is there a second?,82,,
505,0.97,4632.094,4633.695,Second.,83,,
506,0.97,4633.695,4635.731,Thank you.,84,,
507,0.97,4635.731,4639.234,And so I feel that Jeff described it very well.,84,,
508,0.97,4639.234,4648.51,I'm happy to answer any questions or direct you are questions to Jeff.,84,,
509,0.97,4648.51,4651.947,"Councilmembers, I have some comments but I will wait on other Councilmembers to speak.",85,,
510,0.97,4651.947,4660.756,"I'm sorry Jeff, can you remind us on which when the first amendment is that Councilmember Pedersen is bringing.",86,,
511,0.97,4660.756,4667.662,This would oppose an 18 month limit after the date of enactment.,87,,
512,0.97,4667.662,4673.268,So 18 months after going into effect it would end.,87,,
513,0.97,4673.268,4681.91,"All right thank you, I don't have any questions.",88,,
514,0.97,4681.91,4684.379,"Councilmember Morales, do you have any comments?",89,,
515,0.97,4684.379,4690.085,"No, thank you.",90,,
516,0.97,4690.085,4699.161,I just find this amendment completely unacceptable.,91,,
517,0.97,4699.161,4706.468,"The fact is, if you just look at the facts, corporate landlords are all gearing up to carry out what economists predict will be a tsunami of Evictions once the moratorium Zen.",91,,
518,0.97,4706.468,4709.438,This is not a matter of opinion.,91,,
519,0.97,4709.438,4719.481,And we just don't believe that any school kid or educator should face an Eviction at anytime now or in the future.,91,,
520,0.97,4719.481,4735.897,"And by inserting this sunset clause, essentially, any politician would say it is okay for corporate landlords to resume waiting children, their families and public schools to have beginning in 2023.",91,,
521,0.97,4735.897,4739.267,"Why should it and then, it should continue.",91,,
522,0.97,4739.267,4751.379,"And Councilmember Peterson, you presented this as a benign question but the reality is that the Council can always review a legislation.",91,,
523,0.97,4751.379,4758.653,That is the nature of the legislation.,91,,
524,0.97,4758.653,4762.124,A future legislative body in the city can decide what it wants to do.,91,,
525,0.97,4762.124,4764.626,And Council can always pass new amendments changing the laws.,91,,
526,0.97,4764.626,4774.669,"And, if you just wanted this reviewed you would have proposed adding a whereas clause.",91,,
527,0.97,4774.669,4784.379,"But this amendment does not require the Council review, it just makes the protections for children and after 18 months.",91,,
528,0.97,4784.379,4789.951,Reviewing is totally different than ending protections in 18 months.,91,,
529,0.97,4789.951,4793.388,And it is by no means mutual.,91,,
530,0.97,4793.388,4815.11,"Because if we do win, they would have required a community organizing and real momentum by Renters and unions and that means we would need to wage the same battles again and again just to keep from losing what we had won in the past.",91,,
531,0.97,4815.11,4835.43,And in the next 18 months I want Renters and labor unions to be building the movement for economic displacement relocation and what is looming large is the need to cancel Covid debt for struggling homeowners and struggling landlords and small businesses.,91,,
532,0.97,4835.43,4843.038,"So, we need all of that, we need a green new deal.",91,,
533,0.97,4843.038,4847.008,So we faced so many crises including the need for universal Healthcare.,91,,
534,0.97,4847.008,4855.75,It just seems gratuitous that Councilmembers would want people to have to wage the same battle over and over again.,91,,
535,0.97,4855.75,4861.723,I will be voting no on this amendment which is a pro Eviction amendment.,91,,
536,0.97,4861.723,4866.027,"Chair, may I interrupt?",92,,
537,0.97,4866.027,4873.168,"If it's okay, I can share my screen so the public can see the amendments as they come up.",92,,
538,0.97,4873.168,4874.769,That is a really good idea.,93,,
539,0.97,4874.769,4878.74,Thank you so much.,93,,
540,0.97,4878.74,4888.183,"And of course, Councilmembers, if you want to speak, let me know.",93,,
541,0.97,4888.183,4894.789,You make your points very well and I wanted us here for discussion purposes.,94,,
542,0.97,4894.789,4902.264,"We've had a discussion, we've heard from essential staff on it.",94,,
543,0.97,4902.264,4913.108,That was the intent to set it up as a pilot . I personally use these as substantial changes to the regulatory relationship between housing providers and tenants.,94,,
544,0.97,4913.108,4923.718,"If this bill advances out of committee, perhaps my office could work with yours to insert the whereas clause you are talking about.",94,,
545,0.97,4923.718,4938.733,"Just circling back and reporting on how the ordinance is going, what is the implementation, are there any unintended consequences, thank you.",94,,
546,0.97,4938.733,4940.101,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,95,,
547,0.97,4940.101,4944.939,I agree these are substantial changes but I think it is a political question and think the substantial changes are needed and urgently.,95,,
548,0.97,4944.939,4950.045,It's unfortunate that they have not been put in place.,95,,
549,0.97,4950.045,4957.452,"As someone in their public comment said, they would have been able to use these when they were young.",95,,
550,0.97,4957.452,4973.335,"As far as the whereas clause, if you want to do that, my office will be happy to work with you as inserting a whereas clause.",95,,
551,0.97,4973.335,4979.541,I think it is a good practice to review the backup clause in general.,95,,
552,0.97,4979.541,4986.448,"In terms of the amendment, I think the motion has already been made.",95,,
553,0.97,4986.448,4992.754,So I believe we have to vote.,95,,
554,0.97,4992.754,4995.99,"So, as clerk of the committee can you please call the roll?",95,,
555,0.97,4995.99,5014.209,[roll call] one in favor and three opposed.,96,,
556,0.97,5014.209,5019.014,Thank you for describing the amendment.,97,,
557,0.97,5019.014,5024.419,"Amendment number two, Councilmember Pedersen, go ahead.",97,,
558,0.97,5024.419,5025.487,Thank you chair Sawant.,98,,
559,0.97,5025.487,5035.33,I like to move to amend cancel bill 10046 as presented in amendment two which is the definition of educator.,98,,
560,0.97,5035.33,5043.605,Can I get a second?,98,,
561,0.97,5043.605,5047.442,Thank you.,98,,
562,0.97,5047.442,5062.056,"As Jeff described this amendment, it is to define, as I understood, one of the Intents of this bill was to provide additional protections for educators.",99,,
563,0.97,5062.056,5073.268,So this defines that as a substitute teachers and curriculum specialists as defined in the state of Washington state law.,99,,
564,0.97,5073.268,5078.506,It's to target this toward teachers.,99,,
565,0.97,5078.506,5079.974,That is the purpose of this amendment.,99,,
566,0.97,5079.974,5085.647,Happy to answer any questions.,99,,
567,0.97,5085.647,5087.882,"Jeff, did you have anything to add?",100,,
568,0.97,5087.882,5093.888,No Madam chair.,101,,
569,0.97,5093.888,5100.995,"Thank you, Councilmembers, go ahead Councilmember Morales.",102,,
570,0.97,5100.995,5111.072,"So, I am realizing, you just stated this was in alignment with Washington state law.",103,,
571,0.97,5111.072,5128.556,"I think part of my confusion is that some of this seems, I thought these were both intending to be a in alignment with the San Francisco ordinance, and that is a relates to the definition of educator is very different.",103,,
572,0.97,5128.556,5142.837,"It is very broad, to include nurses, administrative staff, even custodians, teachers aides.",103,,
573,0.97,5142.837,5166.06,"I think that is the way we should be thinking of educators in this particular circumstance because who we are really talking about are those who support students and their ability to learn, and keeping their housing stable is also important for the benefit of our young people in their education.",103,,
574,0.97,5166.06,5173.701,I don't think a specialized degree or diploma should be a means test for having protection from possible Eviction.,103,,
575,0.97,5173.701,5185.48,"So, I won't be supporting this amendment, and I just wanted to get that on the record.",103,,
576,0.97,5185.48,5193.888,Thank you Madam chair.,104,,
577,0.97,5193.888,5195.59,I appreciate this amendment coming for discussion purposes.,104,,
578,0.97,5195.59,5211.739,"For some of the same reasons Councilmember Morales just indicated, which is that there are some scope differences between what we are considering here and what, I wouldn't say model legislation but the precedent legislation from San Francisco included.",104,,
579,0.97,5211.739,5223.851,"I think it is also relevant to conversations around how we structure this ordinance to survive ultimate legal scrutiny, and there are concerns around Scoping.",104,,
580,0.97,5223.851,5235.63,I still think that this amendment as presented by Councilmember Pedersen is too narrow.,104,,
581,0.97,5235.63,5244.839,I think it NARROWS it more than what would be required.,104,,
582,0.97,5244.839,5261.456,"And as Councilmember Morales implied, this is narrower than that that San Francisco ordinance while the base ordinance is perhaps slightly more expensive for words things slightly differently.",104,,
583,0.97,5261.456,5266.561,"So, I think this is a prime area to examine as we are going forward to discussing this at full counsel.",104,,
584,0.97,5266.561,5273.034,But I cannot support this amendment today given that I think it NARROWS the scope too much.,104,,
585,0.97,5273.034,5306.0,"And I do think there is a lot of really critical school employees heard I can think of like counselors for example, where it is important for that counselor to not be displaced and be in a position where the kids that are on the caseload for that counselor don't have to switch out multiple counselors in a given year or lose a counselor they have a good rapport with, and other support staff.",104,,
586,0.97,5306.0,5321.249,"So, I won't be voting in favor of this amendment, but I do think that it is still an area where I would anticipate some discussion at full counsel, and I think this is a conversation to have.",104,,
587,0.97,5327.121,5342.07,"As Councilmember Morales said, the language that we developed for this legislation, we obviously took the San Francisco bill as the starting point.",105,,
588,0.97,5342.07,5353.648,And it was important that that precedent was set to rebut the point is to pick the best example by whatever is existing and make it better wherever possible.,105,,
589,0.97,5353.648,5364.225,"So if there is a place where the San Francisco bill effects Renters, obviously we are not looking to make things worse.",105,,
590,0.97,5364.225,5366.461,It's also not acceptable to try to make it better.,105,,
591,0.97,5366.461,5375.636,"So, we want to take the best examples and make it better where possible.",105,,
592,0.97,5375.636,5387.482,"And, in this case, we took the San Francisco example and Re- examine it for ourselves with top educators and teachers.",105,,
593,0.97,5387.482,5401.796,"And they, themselves were very clear, 100% clear, that you cannot exclude any of the school workers from the protections this bill offers.",105,,
594,0.97,5401.796,5406.768,So it there is nothing benign about this amendment.,105,,
595,0.97,5406.768,5416.21,And we have seen a lot of examples of this kind of divide and conquer where some workers get protection and others don't.,105,,
596,0.97,5416.21,5425.219,"But it is right in the demise of the bill of public assistance itself, and I do not accept that.",105,,
597,0.97,5425.219,5445.54,"And so this tries to divide teachers or other workers and Insinuate that other workers like teachers aides, cafeteria workers, bus drivers are not essential to the education of our children and worthy of protection.",105,,
598,0.97,5445.54,5458.486,"For example, this includes special education teachers that provide a relationship to the students.",105,,
599,0.97,5458.486,5472.834,"And we know they are already cut to the bone, and they need to have the support staff on call, and they are already struggling and they are not paid adequately.",105,,
600,0.97,5472.834,5479.874,On top of that to deny them this protection that other workers and teachers will have is just unconscionable.,105,,
601,0.97,5479.874,5492.62,It also excludes Translators for example who are overwhelmingly educators of color and also have families that are struggling to pay rent.,105,,
602,0.97,5492.62,5498.292,I'm not at all clear what Councilmember Lewis means in examining this.,105,,
603,0.97,5498.292,5519.28,"I don't know how you would come up with an Amendmen where you exclude some and include some for protection, what basis will Councilmembers decide which are deserving of this protection which are not.",105,,
604,0.97,5519.28,5522.717,We know they are struggling and we know public education workers are struggling to pay their rent.,105,,
605,0.97,5522.717,5536.23,"In fact, in the 2015 teachers strike, and this was teachers who are paid better than other workers in the school system, the thing I heard the most was not even about the contract they were on strike for.",105,,
606,0.97,5536.23,5542.436,But the fact that they are not able to pay their rent and they are getting pushed out of Seattle and are facing Evictions.,105,,
607,0.97,5542.436,5558.552,"So I think that given how big of an issue this is in the overwhelmingly strong support from the education system, I think this is extremely important that we don't accept this amendment.",105,,
608,0.97,5558.552,5582.577,"And I think as Councilmember Morales was alluding to, education is a Wraparound, and it actually takes the whole support structure in the school system to educate children and provide them with what they need.",105,,
609,0.97,5582.577,5586.581,This is including the bus drivers get them to and from school safely.,105,,
610,0.97,5586.581,5592.653,In fact we have heard so much about what bus drivers do.,105,,
611,0.97,5592.653,5607.601,"They went on strike a few years ago, so, ultimately, how do you decide who will not be considered a part of the village that Educates our schoolchildren.",105,,
612,0.97,5607.601,5610.104,"In my view, none.",105,,
613,0.97,5610.104,5619.013,I will not be supporting the amendment.,105,,
614,0.97,5619.013,5620.881,"Councilmember Pedersen, if you like to close it out.",105,,
615,0.97,5620.881,5628.122,"I just appreciate the discussion and I'm glad we have this on the table to discuss, ready to vote when you are.",106,,
616,0.97,5628.122,5628.522,Thank you.,107,,
617,0.97,5628.522,5631.425,Can you call the roll?,107,,
618,0.97,5631.425,5649.543,"[roll call] three opposed, one in favor.",108,,
619,0.97,5649.543,5657.818,"Thank you, we moved to amendment number three, Councilmember Pedersen, please go ahead.",109,,
620,0.97,5657.818,5668.729,"I would move to amend counsel bill 100 246 with amendment three, amendment three is the one that would accept small landlords.",110,,
621,0.97,5668.729,5673.534,And I can speak to this for a moment.,110,,
622,0.97,5673.534,5684.478,So we heard a lot from those who own four or fewer units.,110,,
623,0.97,5684.478,5692.987,"And those are exempted, I supported the winter band on Evictions.",110,,
624,0.97,5692.987,5696.323,We exempted small landlords from that.,110,,
625,0.97,5696.323,5698.893,They have experienced an array of regulatory changes.,110,,
626,0.97,5698.893,5733.127,"I do not see them as corporate landlords, I see them as those providing housing, provides a diversity of housing options for Renters and want to make sure that, as these changes are layered in, that small landlords don't end up taking their rental housing off the market heard so this would exempt those owning four or fewer units.",110,,
627,0.97,5733.127,5736.43,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,111,,
628,0.97,5736.43,5738.099,"Did we get a second, I'm not sure.",111,,
629,0.97,5738.099,5744.905,To make I will second in consideration of the amendment.,111,,
630,0.97,5744.905,5750.811,Do Council members have any comments?,112,,
631,0.97,5750.811,5761.322,I don't see any other committee members wanted to come in.,112,,
632,0.97,5761.322,5763.624,I will comment that I will not be supporting this amendment.,112,,
633,0.97,5763.624,5766.16,"This bill is about detection children, their education and mental health.",112,,
634,0.97,5766.16,5772.933,"Children, particularly during the fiscal year, regardless of who their Lord is.",112,,
635,0.97,5772.933,5785.479,This amendment especially brings to light what Renee said in public comment where the human rights of Renters have to be paramount.,112,,
636,0.97,5785.479,5793.787,"So effectively by supporting this amendment, Councilmembers would say that this is for small Mom-And-Pop landlords.",112,,
637,0.97,5793.787,5803.264,But there is a real problem with that because many set up companies for each of their buildings and falsely claimed that each building has their own separate landlord.,112,,
638,0.97,5803.264,5808.002,We've seen this happen over and over again.,112,,
639,0.97,5808.002,5817.578,"In fact, my office gets calls from Renters all the time with say they can't figure out who the actual owner is.",112,,
640,0.97,5817.578,5823.784,Because there are so many layers to the ownership papers.,112,,
641,0.97,5823.784,5834.628,It's basically a corporate Shell game and will be delivered as an underhanded mechanism to evade responsibilities.,112,,
642,0.97,5834.628,5843.904,"We have to protect all children educators against Eviction, not just some.",112,,
643,0.97,5843.904,5853.647,"It is unfortunate that other Councilmembers supported it, I don't think we should be replicating what I consider bad precedents.",112,,
644,0.97,5853.647,5868.462,"Just because the past winter Eviction band, if you voted yes on that, it's perfectly fine and correct to vote no this time.",112,,
645,0.97,5868.462,5882.176,"So, if Councilmembers don't have any comments, and I'm watching the screens, then I will, I'm sorry, Councilmember Pedersen, you should close it out.",112,,
646,0.97,5882.176,5887.181,I have no further comment on this.,113,,
647,0.97,5887.181,5887.581,Okay.,114,,
648,0.97,5887.581,5890.251,"So Ted, would you please call the roll?",114,,
649,0.97,5890.251,5911.005,[roll call] three opposed and one in favor.,115,,
650,0.97,5911.005,5917.144,"Okay, now we have amendment four, Councilmember Pedersen, please go ahead.",116,,
651,0.97,5917.144,5918.379,Thank you.,117,,
652,0.97,5918.379,5924.385,I'd like to move to amend counsel bill 120046 with amendment four.,117,,
653,0.97,5924.385,5941.068,"Amendment four would be, and Jeff will help me out here, it essentially would make this proposed new law similar to San Francisco when applying it to the educators.",117,,
654,0.97,5941.068,5955.349,"But it would be more expensive than the San Francisco law, remain more expensive for the children and their families.",117,,
655,0.97,5955.349,5958.252,Those who are students.,117,,
656,0.97,5958.252,5970.23,So I'd like to ask for a second to discuss this.,117,,
657,0.97,5974.535,5981.909,I meant literally to get a second on my motion to continue discussion.,118,,
658,0.97,5981.909,5985.979,But if that is not there then I'm happy that we were at least able to get this on the table.,118,,
659,0.97,5985.979,5992.186,"Thank you Councilmember Pedersen, for lack of a second we will have to move on.",119,,
660,0.97,5992.186,6001.095,"I have motivated this bill, and generally made all the comments I wanted to make.",119,,
661,0.97,6001.095,6009.269,Are there general comments from Councilmembers on the bill as a whole before we hold the question for final vote?,119,,
662,0.97,6009.269,6015.275,I don't see any Councilmember showing interest in speaking again.,119,,
663,0.97,6015.275,6022.916,"So, please call the roll on the passage of the bill.",119,,
664,0.97,6022.916,6027.821,Will it be invalid if I don't read the Council bill?,119,,
665,0.97,6027.821,6035.295,It was written into the record at the beginning of this discussion.,120,,
666,0.97,6035.295,6055.149,"[roll call] three in favor, one opposed.",120,,
667,0.97,6055.149,6063.924,So this would be scheduled to go to the city council meeting on June 7th.,120,,
668,0.97,6063.924,6067.661,Okay.,121,,
669,0.97,6067.661,6069.563,Thank you Councilmembers for engaging in that discussion.,121,,
670,0.97,6069.563,6078.005,And thank you Jeff for the very well laid out information.,121,,
671,0.97,6078.005,6080.24,I very much appreciate the work of the staff as always.,121,,
672,0.97,6080.24,6088.649,"And as Ted indicated, this bill was just pass through committee and will head to the city council for a final vote on Monday June 7th.",121,,
673,0.97,6088.649,6095.856,Our next agenda item is the right of first refusal for Renters facing Eviction.,121,,
674,0.97,6095.856,6101.795,I will begin by reading it into the record.,121,,
675,0.97,6101.795,6122.316,"It is Council bill 120090, ordinance relating to residential Tenancies giving the tenant the right of refusal over new tenancy after the expiration of tenancy for a specified time, requiring the landlord to have just cause for declining to give the tenant the right of first refusal.",121,,
676,0.97,6122.316,6149.143,"Requiring just cause and creating a private action by the tenant and providing the defense of Eviction when the landlord fails to give the tenant the right of first refusal, allowing a tenant to rescind a termination agreement and amending section 7.24 and 24.2 6.160.",121,,
677,0.97,6149.143,6154.081,This is gently sponsored by my office and Councilmember Morales.,121,,
678,0.97,6154.081,6190.45,"I will say a few words, this has been discussed for the last three meetings of this Committee and through those discussions it has become clear that what Renters really need in these situations is the right of first refusal where a landlord is required to give the current tenant the first chance to sign a new lease before offering the lease to any other tenant, prospective tenants unless there is a just cause for Eviction.",121,,
679,0.97,6190.45,6194.721,Renters need a new lease long before there is any question of Eviction.,121,,
680,0.97,6194.721,6206.7,"For Renters this is just reality, few Renters are told by their landlord that they will not have their lease renewed and they refused to leave just because they cannot be evicted in that situation.",121,,
681,0.97,6206.7,6219.68,"In real life, Renters are working people who are struggling and they will start looking for a new place to live and they will start even though they know it is unjust.",121,,
682,0.97,6219.68,6222.516,Because they understandably do not feel confident to fight it out in court.,121,,
683,0.97,6222.516,6234.595,The right of first refusal is read into the part of the municipal code that the Seattle Department of construction and inspections has the power to enforce.,121,,
684,0.97,6234.595,6256.35,"That means if the landlord does not offer a new lease and does not have a just cause, 60 to 90 days before the end of the lease, then the Department of inspection has the power to follow-up, investigate and tell the landlord that they either need to offer a new lease or resent I'd just cause.",121,,
685,0.97,6256.35,6270.264,"If a landlord refuses to follow the law and all of this can happen before the lease ends, so Ideally these issues can be resolved and the Renter can get a new lease without anyone going to Eviction court.",121,,
686,0.97,6270.264,6279.973,"A few other details, the bill also includes a private right of action so that landlords can enforce their rights.",121,,
687,0.97,6279.973,6288.015,A landlord may not bring the tenant to Eviction court if the Leonard has failed to follow this right of first refusal law.,121,,
688,0.97,6288.015,6295.789,"In other words, if the landlord does not follow the right of first refusal law, then they cannot Evict someone.",121,,
689,0.97,6295.789,6307.901,"It is consistent with other parts of Seattle's just cause, for example a landlord may not Evict the Renter from a unit that is not registered as a rental housing unit.",121,,
690,0.97,6307.901,6316.41,It is also for structures of rent and how a mutual termination agreement can be rescinded.,121,,
691,0.97,6316.41,6327.587,The first in time provisions are legally searching for a new tenant only if the person does not agree to the new or current lease.,121,,
692,0.97,6327.587,6340.5,I really appreciate the work of from the District Attorney's office and the city council that is also here with us today to answer any questions.,121,,
693,0.97,6340.5,6347.107,And Devon from my office and Councilmember Morales's office were working to get this ready over the weekend.,121,,
694,0.97,6347.107,6351.078,So I will open it up for Councilmember Mireles.,121,,
695,0.97,6351.078,6354.047,Please go ahead.,121,,
696,0.97,6354.047,6360.654,Thank you.,122,,
697,0.97,6360.654,6379.172,"I really want to start by also appreciating everybody who has worked so hard to bring this forward and make this legislation possible, especially the stay healthy coalition we've been working with to form this since earlier in the year.",122,,
698,0.97,6379.172,6404.398,"I specifically want to think representatives from the housing justice project, the Lgbtq ally ship, the Union of Washington, and lots of landlords with solid ground and Lehi, and so many others who have helped really pull this together.",122,,
699,0.97,6404.398,6412.906,I also want to think my staff members who have really been a rock Star shepherding all of this through.,122,,
700,0.97,6412.906,6422.082,Thank you to Councilmember Lewis for always supporting this push to expand protections and to Councilmember Sawant for agreeing to jointly sponsor this.,122,,
701,0.97,6422.082,6431.425,I think we are really pulling the best elements of our two bills together.,122,,
702,0.97,6431.425,6443.436,To create some important legislation that can really provide a powerful fixed to the cities just cause ordinance.,122,,
703,0.97,6443.436,6455.348,"And to ensure that all tenants, regardless of where they are, or what kind of contracts they have, that they will be protected from the threat of that no fault, no cause removal from their home.",122,,
704,0.97,6455.348,6465.859,"As Councilmember Sawant noted, the new bill provides tenants with the right of first refusal to either stay in their home on a new lease or for a new Month- To-Month agreement, or to voluntarily leave on their own.",122,,
705,0.97,6465.859,6467.461,It also allows landlords to pursuit of removal.,122,,
706,0.97,6467.461,6477.771,"I want to say that again, allows up landlord to pursue a removal if they have a just cause reason to do so.",122,,
707,0.97,6477.771,6492.619,"Endlessly, this legislation strengthens the tenant's bargaining power by allowing them to rescind a mutual lease termination in the case that they were pressured into signing something, if it was not signed in the presence of an attorney, Caseworker or mediator.",122,,
708,0.97,6492.619,6511.271,"As the recovery is near and our emergency tenant protections are lifted, as is planned at this point at the end of June, tenants deserve some stability and they deserve to live their lives without the threat of losing their homes over situations that they cannot control.",122,,
709,0.97,6511.271,6516.843,Think of something as colossal as a pandemic or something as simple as a landlord not liking them.,122,,
710,0.97,6516.843,6519.646,I'm really proud of this legislation.,122,,
711,0.97,6519.646,6533.493,"We've spent nearly five months working with community Stakeholders, our law Department and central staff, counsel colleagues and our Department of construction and inspection.",122,,
712,0.97,6533.493,6536.596,Bringing the strongest bill possible.,122,,
713,0.97,6536.596,6555.048,And I just want to say again thank you to everyone who has helped us get this far and I'm really eager to get this legislation onto the full council.,122,,
714,0.97,6555.048,6556.216,Thank you Madam chair.,123,,
715,0.97,6556.216,6557.651,I will be brief in my comments.,123,,
716,0.97,6557.651,6568.962,I appreciate the chance to cosponsor this successor legislation to the earlier pair of bills dealing with functionally the same issue in slightly different ways.,123,,
717,0.97,6568.962,6591.084,And I appreciate this new composite bill response to recent changes in the state law and extensive advice from our legal Department to make sure this protection will tangibly and effectively attacked Renters from facing what we know is coming and has been characterized by Madam chair as a tsunami of coming Evictions.,123,,
718,0.97,6591.084,6613.273,"And really making sure we have all the protections of the Ghesquiere just cause ordinance protections in place, not that just care is not also important and related issues in housing security and homelessness.",123,,
719,0.97,6613.273,6616.209,But also making sure we have all the protections of our just cause ordinance.,123,,
720,0.97,6616.209,6625.385,But in the event right now that the termination of the lease and the gap between that and the entry of a new one.,123,,
721,0.97,6625.385,6637.998,I want to take advantage of the opportunity to address a couple of concerns that my office heard from a group of small landlords that we had time to talk to yesterday.,123,,
722,0.97,6637.998,6643.67,To hear a number of different issues they had with the legislation in a number of potential concerns.,123,,
723,0.97,6643.67,6651.344,We are going to have to agree to disagree on a number of different areas including the passage of the underlying bill.,123,,
724,0.97,6651.344,6657.951,"But I did want to at least clarify some of the concerns that were aired, and do it on record here.",123,,
725,0.97,6657.951,6666.559,My staff will also be distributing those comments or this response in braiding.,123,,
726,0.97,6666.559,6666.826,Righting.,123,,
727,0.97,6666.826,6684.31,The first one was in concerned that we were passing a regulation that was Impacting landlords in the private sector but exempting landlords who are based in social housing or Low- income housing.,123,,
728,0.97,6684.31,6696.79,"Central staff can correct me if I'm wrong but there is no such Carveout, these just protections impact people regardless of the type of housing, the nature of the housing providers.",123,,
729,0.97,6696.79,6701.127,So if you are low income housing provider you are still covered by the just cause Eviction.,123,,
730,0.97,6701.127,6717.077,"You are still covered by this new counsel bill, so this is not just targeting folks on the private rental market.",123,,
731,0.97,6717.077,6724.284,And can you maybe confirm that?,123,,
732,0.97,6724.284,6730.657,Maybe I should just move the bill.,124,,
733,0.97,6730.657,6732.692,Because I feel like we moved right into discussion.,124,,
734,0.97,6732.692,6737.097,"No, just for the record let me do it and then we can start the discussion.",124,,
735,0.97,6737.097,6741.034,I moved counsel bill 120090.,124,,
736,0.97,6741.034,6742.135,Second.,125,,
737,0.97,6742.135,6752.011,Please go ahead.,126,,
738,0.97,6752.011,6753.747,I'm with your Council central staff.,127,,
739,0.97,6753.747,6761.621,"Yes, that is my understanding of this bill, there are not any Carveouts for any specific types of landlords including social service providers or affordable housing Dividers.",127,,
740,0.97,6761.621,6772.132,"I just do want to make that clear, we are holding the private sector to the same standards that we hold providers that receive public subsidy.",128,,
741,0.97,6772.132,6776.736,The important thing is to make sure everyone can be a Renter with dignity.,128,,
742,0.97,6776.736,6787.647,"Of course we know that subsidized landlords can be problematic, too, in some cases.",128,,
743,0.97,6787.647,6792.786,So I certainly do want to make that clear.,128,,
744,0.97,6792.786,6796.99,There are also concerns on how this interacts with House bill 1236.,128,,
745,0.97,6796.99,6806.266,Katie will send a from the Trans writers Union did a good job in explaining this.,128,,
746,0.97,6806.266,6834.227,"But just to echo those statements, this deals with the perspective successor tenancy rather than deals with continuing to provide just right protections.",128,,
747,0.97,6834.227,6855.915,I did just want to state that on record that it categorically distinct and looking forward to Overs of entry into successful tenancy and the right of first refusal to start that new successor.,128,,
748,0.97,6855.915,6875.835,"Finally counsel bill 12 0090 does allow landlords that are occupying the premises, as for the current just cause ordinance clause, to state that as a reason to decline to offer a right of first refusal new tenancy.",128,,
749,0.97,6875.835,6895.355,"So if you live in the same unit if you are renting the bedroom next to your own bedroom in your own house, you would still be able, under this ordinance, to state that cause and not making the first refusal offer.",128,,
750,0.97,6895.355,6910.737,So in essence that does mean that this does not apply to circumstances where you are essentially roommates with someone and you are like renting the bedroom because it's an Owner-Occupied kind of situation.,128,,
751,0.97,6910.737,6916.609,Because that is one of the existing just causes.,128,,
752,0.97,6916.609,6919.412,And it looks like you maybe wanted to clarify something there?,128,,
753,0.97,6919.412,6927.42,"Yes, the bill itself does apply to that notice requirements.",129,,
754,0.97,6927.42,6931.557,But you can assert the just cause.,129,,
755,0.97,6931.557,6931.925,Exactly.,130,,
756,0.97,6931.925,6946.606,"So I think like functionally and people that expressed this concern can reach out, but functionally I think that concerns the issue that that particular constituent was concerned about.",130,,
757,0.97,6946.606,6948.608,So I did want to put those on the record.,130,,
758,0.97,6948.608,6966.059,"So finally I will just say, having put on the record those concerns that I did hear from folks yesterday, I am comfortable voting for this bill without any further additions to it.",130,,
759,0.97,6966.059,6968.728,I'm proud to cosponsor this legislation and I will rest my comments there.,130,,
760,0.97,6968.728,6975.068,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,131,,
761,0.97,6975.068,6984.544,"And also, if it makes sense still, we should go through each member make whatever comments you feel will be useful.",131,,
762,0.97,6984.544,6985.445,Go ahead Councilmember Pedersen.,131,,
763,0.97,6985.445,6987.98,Thank you chair Sawant.,132,,
764,0.97,6987.98,6996.389,I appreciate the hard work the sponsors have done on the two bills that have been combined.,132,,
765,0.97,6996.389,7001.961,They appeared on our introductory calendar yesterday and we are hearing them today.,132,,
766,0.97,7001.961,7008.568,"I think that because we heard the other two bills previously, a kind of makes sense.",132,,
767,0.97,7008.568,7026.586,"But the public that is tracking this, either the two separate bills that combined into this one, I know this hard work was going on at the time that the state Legislature was also working on House bill 1236 which the governor signed into law.",132,,
768,0.97,7026.586,7036.863,"It is my view that the state law Preempts this, and I personally think that it's pretty clear.",132,,
769,0.97,7036.863,7045.738,I do also want to think the state reps who worked on House bill 1236.,132,,
770,0.97,7045.738,7052.945,But I believe that Preempts this and I will be voting no on this.,132,,
771,0.97,7052.945,7055.214,Councilmember Lewis.,133,,
772,0.97,7055.214,7056.649,Thank you Madam chair.,134,,
773,0.97,7056.649,7078.037,I want to state that I do appreciate Councilmember Pedersen's comments right now in just about the nature of when this counsel Treads into areas of protecting areas and expanding tenant protections.,134,,
774,0.97,7078.037,7082.575,I certainly think nothing is ever Slamdunk when we do it in this area.,134,,
775,0.97,7082.575,7092.885,"Certainly the original just cause ordinance was not a Slamdunk, certainly any other number of tenant protections test forward, have not been.",134,,
776,0.97,7092.885,7115.975,"But I do want to say that the city attorney's office, the litigation team there and that leadership that has been shown during his time as city attorney and focusing on this area, has led to tenants statewide benefiting from the trail we blazed Bypassing things that were sometimes on the edge.",134,,
777,0.97,7115.975,7118.01,By Queuing things up as long as we are careful.,134,,
778,0.97,7118.01,7124.717,In planning how we position and build our ordinance.,134,,
779,0.97,7124.717,7127.42,And in some cases making it landmark state law.,134,,
780,0.97,7127.42,7136.229,"I personally think that based on the work we've done, I'm sure they will still be questions and challenges.",134,,
781,0.97,7136.229,7168.561,That this can be a vehicle again to try to Carveout of bigger vehicle of space this will represent a lot of hard work and I'm sure the Litigators and team that has been assembled for these kinds of cases will with things that are close on the margin and sometimes that is the only way to get progress.,134,,
782,0.97,7168.561,7228.921,"So I appreciate that there is always a balance and envelope pushing and risk aversion and I am certainly one of those members of the Council who wants to make sure we are in a place where we are structuring things so that we are not just going out there completely foolhardy but that we are all crafting it [Indiscernible] But I think this FALLS in with another good example being the right to attorneys where we did a similar process, and I think it is certainly worth a try to expand our social contract and the rights that people who rent have, and for most of my life has been a Renter, and it is important to do.",134,,
783,0.97,7228.921,7298.791,"I want to just first reflect and react to the notion of 1236 Preempting this, our understanding and we have had lots of conversations I had a conversation with--last week that the intention was to allow for municipalities not to be Preempted with that language, they were very careful about trying to craft it in such a way that municipalities would not be Preempted, and as Councilmember Lewis said, we have to balance our own risk aversion with some of the risk aversion coming from our landlords as well, and in public comment we heard a lot from landlords Referencing the U Dub study from 2018 for example and one of those things that the study revealed is that there is a general rejection from the landlord community of ordinances that are intended to provide protections.",135,,
784,0.97,7298.791,7341.033,"I think the study found over 80%, about 89% of the landlords who were surveyed when offered a menu of potential policy options rejected all of them whether they were intended to increase Affordability or increase housing supply or increase protections for Renters, and we know that we are still in a housing crisis so we have to do these things because we have a lot of people who are at risk of experiencing homelessness who cannot afford to find a place to live in this city whose communities are being disrupted because they are getting pushed out still.",135,,
785,0.97,7341.033,7378.971,"I think on balance we have to understand that some people just do not like change, some people are fearful, and we can certainly have the Onversation, it sounds like all of us have had conversations with small landlords and understand that there is some resistance, but we also know that people need to be safe in their homes and to be protected against getting pushed out, so I feel very confident and comfortable moving forward with this, and I look forward to voting yes.",135,,
786,0.97,7378.971,7418.01,"Thank you Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Lewis, I will just add my points and just to concur with what Councilmember Morales said, when the House Democrats passed number 36--told us that House bill 36 did not--in both the Senate and the House rejected amendments that would have made Preemption explicit so that--is clear.",136,,
787,0.97,7418.01,7456.282,Days after it was signed into law by the governor the court ruled that it has Preempted--this is another example of how many obstacles working-class people have to face to get the bare minimum--and we have had two offices doing this obviously there are never any guarantees.,136,,
788,0.97,7456.282,7459.852,The question is are we prepared to fight and it is not a neutral question by any means.,136,,
789,0.97,7459.852,7480.472,"-- think about the enormous financial precipice that working people are always under, especially the vast majority of Renters who are struggling, every month is filled with an enormous amount of risk and it is not of their own amazing their own making.",136,,
790,0.97,7480.472,7544.136,"-- and also our job to understand that actually not all the landlords who are saying they are facing problems and we saw this today--are actually representatives of large real estate corporations but as Councilmember Morales said we have spoken to some small landlords, and some of them have signed our petitions for Renters rights because they agree that the human rights of Renters especially--comes fist so I also feel comfortable moving ahead with the vote unless--okay I am not seeing any Councilmembers wanting to speak, so I will have--from my office call the roll on the passage of the bill.",136,,
791,0.97,7544.136,7550.242,But we have not had--memo.,136,,
792,0.97,7550.242,7557.55,Did you want to go ahead?,136,,
793,0.97,7557.55,7563.255,"I was not able to prepare a memo in time for committee today, so you just have the text of the bill in front of you.",137,,
794,0.97,7563.255,7578.47,I think chair Sawant you had talked through the main provisions of the bill so I do not think there is anything you missed in terms of the main provisions so unless there are specific questions I can answer I will not repeat what you have already described.,137,,
795,0.97,7578.47,7580.673,Okay thank you.,138,,
796,0.97,7580.673,7584.977,Appreciate that.,138,,
797,0.97,7584.977,7596.355,"Ted, will you please call the roll on this bill?",138,,
798,0.97,7596.355,7611.003,"[roll being called] three in favor, one opposed, that is a divided report and it will go to the city council meeting on June 7.",139,,
799,0.97,7611.003,7620.713,"Thank you Ted, and thank you Councilmembers.",140,,
800,0.97,7620.713,7677.97,"Before we close out this agenda item and go to the next one I wanted to especially acknowledge the community members who are part of our growing Renters rights movement who have begun discussions with us--with the leadership of organizations like--began working with--to bring this bill to bear, it is today also back in 2019 some who are watching this might recall our office worked with tenants who are facing Eviction in exactly this kind of situation, we organized a very prominent press conference and a community petition to reverse the landlords attempts to render those tenants homeless.",140,,
801,0.97,7677.97,7697.289,"-- it helped reignite the movement about closing the just cause loophole--right after we did that press conference, the landlord rescinded their attempts to Evict their tenants.",140,,
802,0.97,7697.289,7770.863,"-- I wanted to note the 685 community members who signed our just cause petition in recent weeks and the community members who spoke out in our two previous meetings,--these are some of the many people who worked to bring this legislation to fruition and I am glad we will be able to vote on this in committee.",140,,
803,0.97,7770.863,7793.352,"Our final agenda item is Council bill 120077, the legislation from Councilmember Morales's office which I support and have cosponsored to--I will just read it into the record and then turn it over to Councilmember Morales.",140,,
804,0.97,7793.352,7809.201,"This is Council bill 120077, an ordinance relating to the termination of residential rental Tenancies; providing a defense to Eviction for rent due during the city civil emergency; and amending section 22.206.160 of the Seattle municipal code.",140,,
805,0.97,7809.201,7816.108,Councilmember Morales please go ahead.,140,,
806,0.97,7816.108,7817.109,Thank you so much.,141,,
807,0.97,7817.109,7829.922,I want to just start again by thinking again all the organizers and members of the statehouse stay healthy coalition for continuing to push us to increase tenant protection and for holding us all accountable to the Renters in our city.,141,,
808,0.97,7829.922,7846.004,"According to the National equity Atlas Covid-19 rent debt study for King County, King County Renters owe an average of $4900 in back rent and that is the highest in Washington state.",141,,
809,0.97,7846.004,7857.516,"And in King County we have an estimated 44,000 households who are facing financial hardship that has been brought on by Covid-19, that is more than double any other county in the state.",141,,
810,0.97,7857.516,7858.35,Here is what we know.,141,,
811,0.97,7858.35,7863.956,"We know that over a third of black, Latino, and native communities are burdened with rent.",141,,
812,0.97,7863.956,7892.284,"We know that these households whose work often requires them increased exposure to Covid-19 are also disproportionately uninsured and we know that medical emergency during a pandemic is going to significantly affect people's ability to pay rent, pay for food and Childcare and other bills, these are the essential workers who have kept our city going over the last year.",141,,
813,0.97,7892.284,7914.64,"So following an extreme public health crisis and the closures of all of our workplaces that has been brought on by the pandemic, we saw those numbers skyrocket, 55% of all people facing a pandemic related financial hardship, have a low income already.",141,,
814,0.97,7914.64,7919.311,"62% are people of color, 71% lost their employment related income in the last year.",141,,
815,0.97,7919.311,7934.326,"When you couple this with the fact that in just over 30 days the Eviction moratorium will end, you understand the urgency to provide a defense for Eviction for Renters who have fallen behind on rent because of a financial hardship.",141,,
816,0.97,7934.326,7960.619,"This avalanche of Evictions that is looming is more than just an issue of money, this is a systemic issue that has been brought on by generations of Disinvestment in communities of color by racist housing policies that continue to haunt us to this day and it is an issue of equity that has deep Classist and greatest racist roots and we have to take bold measures.",141,,
817,0.97,7960.619,7978.337,"-- would allow--after being signed into law, if you are a Renter who has faced or will face financial hardship during the civil emergency you will be protected.",141,,
818,0.97,7978.337,8005.464,If a landlord does serve an Eviction notice based on nonpayment of rent they have to include a statement that Notifies the tenant of--at that point Renters myself certify and they can do that by attesting to financial hardship and that can happen when they are Accessing their free legal counsel which they are now afforded thanks to the right to counsel legislation.,141,,
819,0.97,8005.464,8008.3,I do want to emphasize that landlords have resources available as well.,141,,
820,0.97,8008.3,8027.185,A King County executive recently announced that King County will be offering $150 million in assistance to tenants and landlords and we are offering over $20 million with potentially millions more coming with Federal Arpa funding.,141,,
821,0.97,8027.185,8043.268,"I do want to encourage landlords to take advantage of these resources, almost $200 million worth of rental assistance is available right now so it is important that landlords take advantage of that before going the Eviction route.",141,,
822,0.97,8043.268,8058.984,"I also want to say that this bill directly addresses the issue at hand which is that nearly 44,000 people in King county cannot pay rent because they suffered a financial hardship on the Covid-19 pandemic.",141,,
823,0.97,8058.984,8066.091,Our neighbors find themselves caught with a growing mountain of debt and a looming deadline for when that debt will come due.,141,,
824,0.97,8066.091,8075.834,If we do not do something to protect vulnerable Renters now we will face depression era levels of homelessness in the city.,141,,

826,0.97,8084.676,8100.892,"We have to respond to this impending humanitarian and social justice crisis with the gravity it deserves, we have to take action now so that Renters who have faced a financial hardship during the pandemic do not face Eviction, too.",141,,
827,0.97,8100.892,8104.496,And I am eager to have this discussion and look forward to my colleagues support.,141,,
828,0.97,8104.496,8106.498,Thank you.,141,,
829,0.97,8106.498,8116.608,"Aisha, did you want--to ask a question--if you want to go ahead and move the bill.",142,,
830,0.97,8116.608,8124.883,I move that we pass Council bill 120077.,143,,
831,0.97,8124.883,8127.486,Second.,144,,
832,0.97,8127.486,8135.627,Maybe we should take Councilmember Pedersen's question it might be something that you are able to answer.,145,,
833,0.97,8135.627,8148.406,"Thank you, I would love to hear from Osher first and then I will probably direct my question to--if she does not answer it already in her presentation.",146,,
834,0.97,8148.406,8157.816,-- I will just go briefly through the memo on Council bill 120077.,147,,
835,0.97,8157.816,8233.124,"As Councilmember Mireles--Councilmember Morales mentioned--because they suffered financial hardship and the basis for the Eviction is the failure to comply with the 14 day notice to pay or vacate and the tenant failed to pay rent and that resulted in--within a 12 month period, it would require that any notice to terminate the tenancy--and it also requires that as long as, it does not require that, but the effect of the defense is that as long as the tenant remains in the rental unit during the emergency, their defense to Eviction based on nonpayment of rent applies so if it turns out, if the tenant failed to pay rent at any other time, so outside of the Covid- 19 emergency they could still be liable for the Eviction on failure to pay rent during that time period just not during the Covid-19 emergency.",147,,
836,0.97,8233.124,8254.446,"I note that this bill does provide a defense but that does not mean that the tenant is not liable for the rent due, just that they cannot be evicted based on that so a landlord would be able to sue them to collect rent in a separate civil proceeding just not through the Eviction proceeding.",147,,
837,0.97,8254.446,8299.691,"In comparing this with the current Eviction protections a question that has come up is how this was different from what the current Eviction protections do given that we have both a state and city level moratorium on Evictions at the moment based on a variety of reasons for Eviction but also the failure to pay rent as well as a bill that this council passed last year that provides a defense to Eviction for six months after the end of the civil emergency and the distinction here is really about what it is that the bills are preventing, so the moratorium, the six month defense after the civil emergency bill, those are all about the timing of the physical rule of the tenant.",147,,
838,0.97,8299.691,8322.113,"-- they do not eliminate the basis upon which the landlord is able to file for Eviction so in other words the landlord has to wait to file the Eviction until the operative time of the moratorium or the bill is over, and at that point the landlord can then file for Eviction and remove the tenant.",147,,
839,0.97,8322.113,8340.899,In this case it is not the Uplink ability of the timing of the defense that is the issue but that basis of the Eviction itself.,147,,
840,0.97,8340.899,8354.979,-- that failure to pay rent is still the basis of Eviction at the end when those protections expire.,147,,
841,0.97,8354.979,8366.024,For this bill there is no time at which the ability to assert the defense itself expires.,147,,
842,0.97,8366.024,8369.661,Instead the defense is always available that the tenant was unable to pay rent during the civil emergency.,147,,
843,0.97,8369.661,8390.782,"So when the moratorium and the six month defense bill expire, a landlord would be able to file for Eviction on any other basis, but with the protections in this bill, the tenant would always be able to assert a defense.",147,,
844,0.97,8390.782,8407.198,"So in essence it is not about when the physical removal will happen but when the failure to pay rent happens, and so that is the main difference between this bill and the protections that are set up in the moratorium and the other six month defense bill.",147,,
845,0.97,8407.198,8412.504,And so if there are any questions I am happy to answer them at this point.,147,,
846,0.97,8412.504,8419.811,Councilmember Pedersen go ahead.,148,,
847,0.97,8419.811,8421.179,Thank you for the presentation.,149,,
848,0.97,8421.179,8423.915,I wanted to follow-up on one of the things you said about the timing.,149,,
849,0.97,8423.915,8446.938,"So the legislation before us seems very tied to the Covid-19 pandemic and hardship emanating from that, and I know with some of our recent legislation which I have supported such as the payment plans, they applied six months after the civil emergency is lifted, with this legislation could you clarify Úthere is no time limit?",149,,
850,0.97,8446.938,8501.092,"That is correct, the time limit does not affect the ability to assert the defense, it only affects when the payment of rent was due, so the limitation is around the time at which the rent came due, so if it was during the Covid-19 emergency the person was not able to pay rent due to financial hardship that is always going to be a defense against Eviction so in three years from now assuming that there are not others other limitations on--in three years from now if a landlord were to file an Eviction and say it is because the tenant did not pay rent during the Covid-19 emergency, the tenant would still be able to assert the defense that because they Hd financial hardship they were not able to pay that rent.",150,,
851,0.97,8501.092,8511.202,"Again it is not saying that the tenant themselves do not owe the rent, it is just that they would not lose their housing because they still owed the rent.",150,,
852,0.97,8511.202,8513.204,May I follow-up?,151,,
853,0.97,8513.204,8517.108,Absolutely.,152,,
854,0.97,8517.108,8551.242,"So to play out a different scenario, if somebody is--if the Covid-19 emergency has been lifted and we are past the six months of the payment plan legislation which I supported, if somebody has paid up all their rent, but then they have a hardship that is tied to Covid-19 in some way, are they able to assert this defense five years from now and say that it was Covid-19 related?",153,,
855,0.97,8551.242,8552.443,Mostly no.,154,,
856,0.97,8552.443,8571.563,"And that is because it is for as long as the civil emergency lasts, and so if the person ended up having issues that are related to Covid-19 that occurred after the end of the civil emergency and was not able to pay their rent this defense would not apply.",154,,
857,0.97,8571.563,8578.069,The defense is specific to the period of time during which the civil emergency because of Covid-19 is in place.,154,,
858,0.97,8578.069,8583.141,Thank you.,155,,
859,0.97,8583.141,8588.179,"Thank you, any other questions from Council members?",156,,
860,0.97,8588.179,8590.848,--,156,,
861,0.97,8590.848,8598.79,Just the reposed amendments if you all are ready to move on to that discussion.,157,,
862,0.97,8598.79,8601.192,I think we should move to that.,158,,
863,0.97,8601.192,8614.505,"I will share my screen--there are two proposed amendments, both proposed by Councilmember Pedersen.",159,,
864,0.97,8614.505,8643.167,It first would limit the applicability of the bill to landlords who have ownership interest in more than four units---- can you all see that?,159,,
865,0.97,8643.167,8653.645,I cannot tell if it shared.,159,,
866,0.97,8656.914,8658.249,--,159,,
867,0.97,8658.249,8666.624,Is it okay if I speak to this amendment?,160,,
868,0.97,8666.624,8711.335,This is similar to the amendment previously also similar to the amendment we had approved--again the main point here is these housing Dividers are also struggling in a better way to address this would be to provide additional rental assistance as needed rather than a regulatory change here I am concerned that the fact that there is no time limit on this and so I will address this in a second amendment --,161,,
869,0.97,8738.362,8748.639,"It seems like we are not getting a second, are you okay moving to your second amendment?",162,,
870,0.97,8748.639,8749.307,Yes.,163,,
871,0.97,8749.307,8755.613,Thank you for showing the second one.,163,,
872,0.97,8755.613,8807.298,"This amendment would have a time limit of 18 months and while it is not specifically tied to the ending of the Covid- 19 pandemic and a grace period, a long grace period after the ending of this emergency it does enable us to be more closely tied to the time period of the Covid-19 pandemic and not have it go on in Perpetuity as the legislation is written and it is something that within 18 months we can Revisit it and extend it if the data was showing that we need to do that, but this is putting a time limit on the legislation which would presumably be similar to the timing of the end of the Covid-19 pandemic with a grace period beyond that.",163,,
873,0.97,8807.298,8824.015,"And so I will attempt to move this, to move to amend Council bill 120077 with amendment to which would have a time limit of 18 months.",163,,
874,0.97,8824.015,8828.92,Can I get a second?,163,,
875,0.97,8828.92,8835.693,"That was quick, I appreciate the chair at least letting us talk about these things today.",163,,
876,0.97,8835.693,8847.004,"Absolutely, we have not gotten any, for lack of the second we have to stop the discussion.",164,,
877,0.97,8847.004,8861.752,So I will just open it up again for any further comments on the bill as a whole.,164,,
878,0.97,8864.322,8865.256,"Councilmember Morales, go ahead.",164,,
879,0.97,8865.256,8911.202,"I wanted to reiterate one of the things I said before which was that there is rental assistance available for landlords, $150 million from the county, $20 million from the city for now, with the potential for more coming, so I think that the challenge here is, and we do risk people attempting to Evict instead of taking advantage of that assistance that is available, and so I think we need to make sure the folks are protected and even if the tenant has lost their job or because of Covid- 19 is not able to pay their rent that does not mean that the landlord does not have an option for getting their rent paid.",165,,
880,0.97,8911.202,8936.294,"So I just want to remind people of that, and again, the preference is for folks to go that route rather than trying to Evict people, but if they do that, then there needs to be an Eviction defense, a defense to that kind of Eviction that is based on the financial hardship that the people in the city are experiencing.",165,,
881,0.97,8936.294,8957.915,And I will just add a few points in closing before we have--I just wanted to note that this is both an economic justice and a racial justice bill.,166,,
882,0.97,8957.915,9051.742,"Because of--Unsurprisingly face far greater Covid-19 related debt burdens on top of the Pre-Existing debt burden that comes from the Endemic discrimination and therefore are at far greater risk of--I appreciate Councilmember Morales bringing this forward and as I said before--last September just on the question of the racial justice issue, last September--reported that 31% of Renters had unpaid rent, and the report went on, the share of white Renters is well below the overall rate at 24% Meanwhile--this is a real estate Website analyst who has conducted this study and--31% of Renters with unpaid rent and on top of that if you look at it broken down by the racial demographic, how acutely the black and Latino communities are facing this crisis of unpaid rent which is basically rental debt, it is just stunning.",166,,
883,0.97,9051.742,9145.002,"And while supporting this legislation we also have to be clear that as--explained--we all know that it is happening and that is where the tsunami of Evictions is going to come from, I think community members will agree with me that we have to build on this by actually also going ahead and fighting for debt cancellation and rent control, and by that I mean cancellation of rental mortgage and utility debts for households that have lost money and been financially devastated due to the Covid-19 pandemic and by mortgage debt cancellation I am including mortgage debt of struggling landlords and that includes struggling homeowners in the middle-class and Working- class who we know in the great recession and the fallout from the great recession in 2011, America had just a stunning foreclosure crisis with at least 6 million foreclosures happening, and it was Working- class people, middle-class people who lost their homes and this is what happened, the capitalists and the banks, the banks got bailed out and ordinary people got sold out, and I think that principle applies to the question of canceling debt this time around because when you say cancel debt, who is going to pay for that debt?",166,,
884,0.97,9145.002,9174.064,"It has to be not working people and Renters, but it has to be the real estate corporations, it has to be big banks that underwrite real estate deals and--and big landlords, so it is really important for the committee to be considering this bill and I would invite you to --",166,,
885,0.97,9185.476,9206.497,"-- [roll being called] three in favor, one opposed, --",167,,
886,0.97,9206.497,9220.511,"Okay, thank you Councilmembers for engaging the committee and I will--going to the full Council on June 7?",168,,
887,0.97,9220.511,9221.412,Yes.,169,,
888,0.97,9221.412,9241.065,"Thank you very much, I appreciate all committee members, all community members who have engaged today and--thank you from central staff, really appreciate--from my office for helping through this Committee.",170,,
889,0.97,9241.065,9246.136,"If there are no further comments, I will go ahead and adjourn.",170,,
