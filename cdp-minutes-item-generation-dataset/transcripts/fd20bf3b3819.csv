57,0.97,249.148,261.16,"Is it true that most of the homeless efforts have gone exclusively to 66% of the black and Brown homeless, regardless of crimes, drugs or mental problems?",18,,

116,0.97,523.556,527.026,Great.,33,,

118,0.97,535.768,541.374,Which is an emergency response to addressing homelessness.,33,,

126,0.97,578.544,582.782,I will try to promote don to Panelist.,36,,
127,0.97,582.782,587.653,I'm having some difficulty to do it.,36,,
128,0.97,587.653,594.126,So it might be easier if you can do it.,36,,
129,0.97,594.126,595.294,Don has been promoted.,37,,
130,0.97,595.294,596.629,Thank you.,38,,
131,0.97,596.629,600.433,"Don, do you want to introduce yourself for the weekend.",38,,
132,0.97,600.433,600.766,Hi.,39,,
133,0.97,600.766,604.37,My name is dawn shepherd.,39,,
134,0.97,604.37,605.871,I use she her pronouns.,39,,
135,0.97,605.871,613.613,I am just stepping into one of the Codirectors for the pier navigation KCRA.,39,,
136,0.97,613.613,614.413,"Thanks, dawn.",40,,
137,0.97,614.413,615.715,Good to see you.,40,,
138,0.97,615.715,616.015,All right.,40,,
139,0.97,616.015,621.12,Partnership for zero is an initiative that is focused on treating an emergency like an emergency.,40,,
140,0.97,621.12,630.096,"So we really want to make sure that when we say the word crisis, we are responding with crisis protocols, and that is what partnership for zero is designed to do.",40,,
141,0.97,630.096,634.4,The goal is to create a functional zero subsystem in the downtown core.,40,,
142,0.97,634.4,646.746,And how that work will be done is the deployment of an emergency management approach to drive a coordinated crisis response for the unsheltered population living downtown.,40,,
143,0.97,646.746,654.487,And to create a sustainable infrastructure that can maintain that in a defined space.,40,,
144,0.97,654.487,660.526,"When we talk about the downtown core, this is the rough map that we use.",40,,
145,0.97,660.526,664.764,So we're essentially talking Belltown to the International district.,40,,
146,0.97,664.764,664.997,I also.,40,,
147,0.97,664.997,668.567,"To note, right, that like these boundaries might move.",40,,
148,0.97,668.567,669.568,And that's actually okay.,40,,
149,0.97,669.568,669.802,Right?,40,,
150,0.97,669.802,674.106,"The purpose of the boundaries is to denote, where there will be a focus of the deployment.",40,,
151,0.97,674.106,677.443,"But Obviously, what we will do is respond to where people are.",40,,
152,0.97,677.443,687.787,"And so if we identify, right, that there are folks experiencing unsheltered homelessness, that are slightly above or below, right?",40,,
153,0.97,687.787,689.155,The northern or Southern boundaries.,40,,
154,0.97,689.155,692.058,We'll look to make sure that we engage them.,40,,
155,0.97,692.058,695.428,I also want to note that the purpose--or sorry.,40,,
156,0.97,695.428,711.711,"The reason why we are focused on the downtown core is because based on Thebasis that the authority can see, is where the largest population of unsheltered homeless in the county.",40,,
157,0.97,711.711,713.345,I want to be straightforward about that.,40,,
158,0.97,713.345,720.352,"In a number of spaces, just trying to be very clear, that this initiative is not driven by business needs.",40,,
159,0.97,720.352,722.721,"It's not, you know, drink because we think downtown is special.",40,,
160,0.97,722.721,725.858,It is driven because this is the highest concentration.,40,,
161,0.97,725.858,731.197,And we need to go to where our humanitarian crisis calls us to be.,40,,
162,0.97,731.197,740.339,"The funding partners for this work are Philanthropy, business, the authority, the city of Seattle, and King County.",40,,
163,0.97,740.339,741.841,And we have a Five-Phase approach.,40,,
164,0.97,741.841,743.309,So we are in phase 1 now.,40,,
165,0.97,743.309,749.815,We are Ramping up and developing our unified command center.,40,,
166,0.97,749.815,752.418,Dawn and her three Codirectors have Beenhired.,40,,
167,0.97,752.418,756.589,We next will focus on the development of a downtown list.,40,,
168,0.97,756.589,760.226,"In the third phase, we will focus on case planning and resource matching.",40,,
169,0.97,760.226,765.197,"So that will help us understand, with Granularity, who needs what.",40,,
170,0.97,765.197,768.801,And then support them in Accessing the right services.,40,,
171,0.97,768.801,775.708,The fourth phase will really focus on making sure that we are executing on--we'll be placing people along the way.,40,,
172,0.97,775.708,780.88,But the fourth phase is Reallyconcentrated draw down.,40,,
173,0.97,780.88,785.117,That's where we're really getting people into long-term housing and exits.,40,,
174,0.97,785.117,787.62,And the fifth is hold steady.,40,,
175,0.97,787.62,790.222,That's where we establish and maintain that functional zero.,40,,
176,0.97,790.222,793.826,How we'll do this is through a unified command center.,40,,
177,0.97,793.826,798.13,A best practice coming on the of the emergency management space.,40,,
178,0.97,798.13,805.938,Unified command centers are designed especially to support Multijurisdictional work.,40,,
179,0.97,805.938,815.681,"That unified command table will have at it, the city, the county, the authority, as well as folks with subject experience.",40,,
180,0.97,815.681,828.194,"And those four perspectives will inform the daily deployment of resources, inclusive of peer navigation supports, fire, health one, et cetera.",40,,
181,0.97,828.194,840.339,Like really making sure that all the resources of the jurisdictions are being made available to this work.,40,,
182,0.97,840.339,847.046,The benefit of a unified command response is its Replicability and Scalability as primary.,40,,
183,0.97,847.046,847.279,Right?,40,,
184,0.97,847.279,854.119,"In emergency management, we want to make sure that things that we set up are things we can scale up or down or move as needed.",40,,
185,0.97,854.119,860.259,This is one of the core reasons we are trying to move towards a true crisis response model.,40,,
186,0.97,860.259,865.698,"Because it will allow us to expand this, both to other neighborhoods and Seattle Metro.",40,,
187,0.97,865.698,873.105,"But you know, frankly, from our perspective, it allows us to also think about what it looks like to scale to other Subregions.",40,,
188,0.97,873.105,875.307,And across the county.,40,,
189,0.97,875.307,882.047,"Additionally, we also benefit from those clear and shared objectives.",40,,
190,0.97,882.047,887.786,"Streamlined process for gathering, analyzing information to inform Decision- making.",40,,
191,0.97,887.786,892.524,Clear chains of command that increase efficiency and coordination.,40,,
192,0.97,892.524,894.193,And that it coordinated intentional resource deployment.,40,,
193,0.97,894.193,907.473,"And then when we talk about maintaining functional zero, one of the core differences between what we proposed doing in partnership for zero and other initiatives is we're going to park the infrastructure that did the work.",40,,
194,0.97,907.473,907.706,Right?,40,,
195,0.97,907.706,917.216,So in a lot of instances where we resolved complex Encampments Orsuccessfully house a number of folks.,40,,
196,0.97,917.216,919.551,We then moved the resources that did that.,40,,
197,0.97,919.551,920.219,Right?,40,,
198,0.97,920.219,931.897,"In this initiative, what we're proposing is to leave that in place, so that as new folks enter the downtown core and are experiencing unsheltered homelessness, they can be met by people, right?",40,,
199,0.97,931.897,934.7,Who are able to immediately begin working with them.,40,,
200,0.97,934.7,936.835,On how they can exit.,40,,
201,0.97,936.835,939.138,And I want to be clear.,40,,
202,0.97,939.138,941.24,"Not just exit downtown, right?",40,,
203,0.97,941.24,942.675,Exit homelessness.,40,,
204,0.97,942.675,956.155,"The other thing that I would lift up is that the navigator cost themselves, we are deeply appreciative of the catalytic investment that allows us to launch this program.",40,,
205,0.97,956.155,964.997,"But the Sustainability path is through accreditation of our navigators, and supporting their positions long term, via Medicaid reimbursement.",40,,
206,0.97,964.997,971.87,Which we are in the process of standing up the internal systems necessary to do that now.,40,,
207,0.97,971.87,984.383,And we are working with our partners at King County to identify the needs and then ongoing funding sources for High-Acuity shelter work.,40,,
208,0.97,984.383,991.39,"And our weekly conversation, with Dchs, and in particular, some of our colleagues at the behavioral health and recovery division.",40,,
209,0.97,991.39,1009.808,"I want to briefly pass it over to my colleagues, in particular, Dr. Martinez and dawn, to talk a little bit about the reality of some of the boots on the ground work, when it comes to being a navigator or providing service.",40,,
210,0.97,1009.808,1017.015,And so I'm just going to click to this slide.,40,,
211,0.97,1017.015,1021.286,"And I wonder, Shea, if you might kick us off?",40,,
212,0.97,1021.286,1027.259,You're muted.,40,,
213,0.97,1027.259,1028.16,Sorry.,41,,
214,0.97,1028.16,1039.538,So this slide shows us kind of what a week might look like in the lives of one of our Clients/Patients.,41,,
215,0.97,1039.538,1040.706,"For me, it's patient.",41,,
216,0.97,1040.706,1045.044,So that's what I'm going to be using.,41,,
217,0.97,1045.044,1045.444,It is fragmented.,41,,
218,0.97,1045.444,1051.283,And it requires a lot of different travel between different meeting sites.,41,,
219,0.97,1051.283,1055.687,"Whether that's meeting the needs of Healthcare appointments, food, hygiene needs.",41,,
220,0.97,1055.687,1059.324,You can see that it takes a lot of work on a daily basis.,41,,
221,0.97,1059.324,1065.697,One way we can help people kind of navigate their daily lives is through outreach.,41,,
222,0.97,1065.697,1076.975,"And I think outreach and peer Navigations are very often used as the same terminology, when they're actually quite different.",41,,
223,0.97,1076.975,1079.711,Outreach workers and getting crisis.,41,,
224,0.97,1079.711,1089.321,"Oftentimes, it will be helping someone navigate from an encampment for day services.",41,,
225,0.97,1089.321,1091.723,Whether case manager or job training.,41,,
226,0.97,1091.723,1094.426,But once they get to that door.,41,,
227,0.97,1094.426,1098.297,The outreach to do the same.,41,,
228,0.97,1098.297,1102.935,Peer navigation is actually much more intensive.,41,,
229,0.97,1102.935,1107.039,And they really help clients or patients work through the entire system.,41,,
230,0.97,1107.039,1110.409,So by building relationships with those individuals.,41,,
231,0.97,1110.409,1116.348,"And it helps them, exactly what it says, navigate a very fragmented system.",41,,
232,0.97,1116.348,1129.461,So they can meet all the needs they have used the resources they need to get through their recovery out of homelessness.,41,,
233,0.97,1129.461,1129.862,"Thanks, Shea.",42,,
234,0.97,1129.862,1137.469,"Dawn, you've been doing this work just like Shea, actually, for, you know, out in community.",42,,
235,0.97,1137.469,1142.941,And I'm curious if there is anything you would add to that?,42,,
236,0.97,1142.941,1152.918,"And in particular, what you know, is there anything that you're looking forward to being able to execute, you know, as one of the leads now of this new work?",42,,
237,0.97,1152.918,1153.285,Yeah.,43,,
238,0.97,1153.285,1154.453,Thank you.,43,,
239,0.97,1154.453,1176.208,I would just want to add that I feel like one of the most Time- intensive parts of doing our job as outreach case managers is developing a relationship that you need to have in order for our clients to both trust us and even turn to us and ask for the help that they are interested in.,43,,
240,0.97,1176.208,1191.69,"And a lot of times, the disjointed sort of chaotic or what was just being described, is more about showing people where they need to go, instead of necessarily walking through all of it with them.",43,,
241,0.97,1191.69,1210.742,And so by having one person with a small case load that is able to literally go through each process with them I feel like we're going to increase the time and level of trust that our clients have with us.,43,,
242,0.97,1210.742,1219.284,"And just by being a peer navigator, I think intrinsically implies that, I know for myself, I have a lot of lived experience.",43,,
243,0.97,1219.284,1230.796,And there are things about approaching each one of our like government or city or other type of resource that most people don't necessarily think of when it comes to how we engage.,43,,
244,0.97,1230.796,1238.704,"And there are barriers for a lot of our clients that are living in shelters, that people are not necessarily comfortable talking about.",43,,
245,0.97,1238.704,1265.297,"So I think that being able to have a closer, more continuous relationship with the folks that they're working with that are going to actually step through those things, help them navigate inside of, like let's say if I'm calling Dhs with a client of mine, who has no idea what type of services they're being able to access, like being able to sit with them and talk through what options there are.",43,,
246,0.97,1265.297,1268.267,So they can make informed choices about what they're looking to do.,43,,
247,0.97,1268.267,1269.801,I think we're seeing that increase.,43,,
248,0.97,1269.801,1275.941,And we'll see the level of distrust with agencies decrease.,43,,
249,0.97,1275.941,1279.278,"Not really sure if that's what you're looking for, mark.",43,,
250,0.97,1279.278,1279.544,Yeah.,44,,
251,0.97,1279.544,1281.98,You always knock it out of the park.,44,,
252,0.97,1281.98,1283.081,That was brilliant.,44,,
253,0.97,1283.081,1283.382,Thank you.,44,,
254,0.97,1283.382,1294.593,"I just briefly would, in closing, would say, you know, some of what folks were talking about, right, is that the current system experience is just a lot of fragmentation, in terms of who you are working with, right?",44,,
255,0.97,1294.593,1307.939,And one of the core things that we're looking forward to being able to provide through our peer navigation work is that continuity of emotional support that dawn and Shea were talking about.,44,,
256,0.97,1307.939,1312.711,"The last thing I'll just add, before turns it over to Felicia.",44,,
257,0.97,1312.711,1323.488,"The last thing I will say is that when we talk about sort of like how navigation supports people, I was reflecting on my own story the next day.",44,,
258,0.97,1323.488,1327.125,And the fact that I never had to sleep in shelter.,44,,
259,0.97,1327.125,1334.566,"And you know, part of how we approach people needs to have inside.",44,,
260,0.97,1334.566,1338.97,"It, a core recognition that many people, right?",44,,
261,0.97,1338.97,1344.476,"Exit homelessness, through the strength of community and relationship.",44,,
262,0.97,1344.476,1348.513,"And not necessarily, right, by Accessing shelter or going to permanent support of housing.",44,,
263,0.97,1348.513,1363.428,"And we need to really keep that in mind, because I think that it will help us broaden our notion of what the recovery pathways are for folks to exit the trauma of homelessness and Reintegrate into community.",44,,
264,0.97,1363.428,1367.966,And I'm really looking forward to this work.,44,,
265,0.97,1367.966,1377.109,"And the expertise that our team can bring to it, helping to shape that real Empowerment- based strategy for folks.",44,,
266,0.97,1377.109,1378.41,And I think that's it.,44,,
267,0.97,1378.41,1382.414,And I'll pass it to Felicia.,44,,
268,0.97,1382.414,1383.749,"Thanks, mark.",45,,
269,0.97,1383.749,1391.79,"I'm just here to again, reiterate our support, as we are in with the private dollars, coming from Philanthropy in business.",45,,
270,0.97,1391.79,1392.19,For this model.,45,,
271,0.97,1392.19,1402.901,"We're really excited about the hiring of peer navigators, specifically knowing that that comes out of community, the folks with lived experience, and the lived experience coalition, have been champions of that approach for many, many years.",45,,
272,0.97,1402.901,1415.881,"And as mark has shared on numerous occasions, we'd know how Evidence-Based practices like peer navigation works in the health space, so it's time for us to really bring that to the homeless response system.",45,,
273,0.97,1415.881,1418.85,"Again, just here to reiterate our support for the overall approach.",45,,
274,0.97,1418.85,1431.096,We want to work in partnership with the regional homeless community and other cities across the city of Seattle to take this to scale as we learn from this initial pilot project.,45,,
275,0.97,1431.096,1433.365,Excellent.,46,,
276,0.97,1433.365,1437.469,And is that the entire presentation?,46,,
277,0.97,1437.469,1438.336,I believe so.,47,,
278,0.97,1438.336,1438.67,Excellent.,48,,
279,0.97,1438.67,1444.776,"Well, thank you so much for coming by and giving us that overview.",48,,
280,0.97,1444.776,1452.217,It's really nice always to get an update on how this effort is coming together and all the partners that are involved in making it happen.,48,,
281,0.97,1452.217,1454.085,I'm sure that my colleagues have some questions.,48,,
282,0.97,1454.085,1456.087,And I have a couple as well.,48,,
283,0.97,1456.087,1474.039,"I mean, I think I want to start with, something Dr. Martinez said that I think is so important in referring to folks who are going to be the clients of the peer navigation, as patients.",48,,
284,0.97,1474.039,1475.907,Because I think increasingly is something we lose track of.,48,,
285,0.97,1475.907,1481.746,"And I'm trying to train myself to say more access to health care, instead of services.",48,,
286,0.97,1481.746,1483.682,Like we talk about parenting.,48,,
287,0.97,1483.682,1486.685,"You know, like housing with services.",48,,
288,0.97,1486.685,1490.522,What I think we really mean in a lot of cases is Healthcare.,48,,
289,0.97,1490.522,1498.697,"In essence of the, you know, the Cooccurrence of chronic homelessness, and lots of public health conditions.",48,,
290,0.97,1498.697,1509.407,And I wonder if we might just take a moment to talk about that component of the system navigation that we're looking at here.,48,,
291,0.97,1509.407,1517.449,And making the best use of access t public health resources.,48,,
292,0.97,1517.449,1524.956,"Access to you know, helping break down the barriers of giving folks access to care, and culturally competent care.",48,,
293,0.97,1524.956,1527.325,And how that could be a component of this work.,48,,
294,0.97,1527.325,1530.295,I don't know who best to direct that question to on the panel.,48,,
295,0.97,1530.295,1536.201,"But just putting that out there, generally.",48,,
296,0.97,1536.201,1538.803,Well--so yes.,49,,
297,0.97,1538.803,1542.607,Peer navigators can assist people in getting to appointments.,49,,
298,0.97,1542.607,1545.911,They can also assist them with getting signed up for benefits.,49,,
299,0.97,1545.911,1554.986,"I mean, one way I like to think about this whole program, it's almost like a translator service, as well as a support service.",49,,
300,0.97,1554.986,1563.528,It's hard enough for me as a physician to navigate my own health insurance.,49,,
301,0.97,1563.528,1576.474,"Meanwhile, someone who has limited skills to figure out how to sign up and use the services that they're able for and may not have known about in the past.",49,,
302,0.97,1576.474,1577.876,Health service business is important.,49,,
303,0.97,1577.876,1583.081,"But I think peer navigators, it's not just help services.",49,,
304,0.97,1583.081,1588.053,I think that's one thing we think about in terms of getting into supportive housing.,49,,
305,0.97,1588.053,1596.227,"So often, there are help services within housing buildings within our housing and outreach teams.",49,,
306,0.97,1596.227,1603.234,And for the homeless providers that work from housing buildings.,49,,
307,0.97,1603.234,1604.436,But it's job navigation.,49,,
308,0.97,1604.436,1606.671,It's criminal justice system navigation.,49,,
309,0.97,1606.671,1609.774,It really is whole person care that we engage with.,49,,
310,0.97,1609.774,1618.717,"And peer navigators help connect people and help translate the language of the systems to their clients, to empower them to be able to do this on their own.",49,,
311,0.97,1618.717,1618.984,So yes.,49,,
312,0.97,1618.984,1622.12,Healthcare is a huge part of that.,49,,
313,0.97,1622.12,1623.455,And that's obviously my real help.,49,,
314,0.97,1623.455,1627.325,That's something I want to be supportive of.,49,,
315,0.97,1627.325,1632.097,I don't want to minimize it to say it is only one service.,49,,
316,0.97,1632.097,1634.032,There's so much more that goes into it.,49,,
317,0.97,1634.032,1639.237,And into recovery from homelessness than just receiving Healthcare.,49,,
318,0.97,1639.237,1641.473,"Although again, a huge part of it.",49,,
319,0.97,1641.473,1641.74,Yeah.,50,,
320,0.97,1641.74,1642.173,I appreciate that.,50,,
321,0.97,1642.173,1652.117,"I didn't want to imply that the peer navigators were only going to be providing, you know, Healthcare navigation.",50,,
322,0.97,1652.117,1653.952,So I did just want to clarify that.,50,,
323,0.97,1653.952,1657.122,But did want to drill into that particular component.,50,,
324,0.97,1657.122,1665.73,"Because I think it's one of the places where we've seen you know, a lack of coordination in the past.",50,,
325,0.97,1665.73,1669.834,"Where hopefully, this will see some improvement there.",50,,
326,0.97,1669.834,1671.469,So appreciate that.,50,,
327,0.97,1671.469,1671.736,Dawn.,51,,
328,0.97,1671.736,1675.373,I apologize.,51,,
329,0.97,1675.373,1680.745,I just wondered if you had anything you wanted to add for the chairman's question.,51,,
330,0.97,1680.745,1681.012,Yeah.,52,,
331,0.97,1681.012,1690.288,I think one of the most important parts of the work that I have done with clients is knowing what is available to folks.,52,,
332,0.97,1690.288,1697.962,"If you call Dhss and specifically say, I'd like to sign up for your Abd program, they're not going to offer it to you.",52,,
333,0.97,1697.962,1703.234,There are so many times I talk to clients and they don't even know what the options are available to them.,52,,
334,0.97,1703.234,1709.841,"So being able to help them identify and even articulate what it is they're trying to do, or what their personal goals are.",52,,
335,0.97,1709.841,1721.853,"And a lot of times, if you are not somebody who is comfortable engaging in conversation with a perfect stranger, you're never going to find out that certain services are available to you.",52,,
336,0.97,1721.853,1725.29,And if you can't articulate what your own needs are.,52,,
337,0.97,1725.29,1731.596,"You certainly aren't going to be able to go out looking for them, even if you can't advocate for yourself.",52,,
338,0.97,1731.596,1743.441,"One of the things I've enjoyed with my clients is I've been through pretty much every one of the Reentry, mental health, substance use disorders.",52,,
339,0.97,1743.441,1748.88,All of the things folks I work with have come into contact with.,52,,
340,0.97,1748.88,1750.081,I've had to do that.,52,,
341,0.97,1750.081,1753.284,Both in my personal experience and in my professional experience.,52,,
342,0.97,1753.284,1754.986,I have a wider range.,52,,
343,0.97,1754.986,1759.758,"A much wider range, of information I can share with my clients, if they don't even know it's available.",52,,
344,0.97,1759.758,1777.442,"So I think that's probably the most key or critical piece to this work, is if you can identify with what somebody might be facing, that nay might not necessarily be aware of as a barrier, and being able to talk about ways to overcome that.",52,,
345,0.97,1777.442,1784.916,"For instance, if I have a client who wants to go to shelter, but they have been turned down because they have a Pelt, animal or cat.",52,,
346,0.97,1784.916,1789.754,And I know the shelters usually don't take animals.,52,,
347,0.97,1789.754,1795.76,I can set your pet to be set up with the pet Registry and get an I.D.,52,,
348,0.97,1795.76,1796.461,For that animal.,52,,
349,0.97,1796.461,1803.735,And when you move toward shelter Orhousing that barrier has been taken care of for you.,52,,
350,0.97,1803.735,1814.479,"Just knowing someone who knows what the options are that are available, and can help flush out and draw out things out of the client that are actually meaningful and affect the decision-making on their part.",52,,
351,0.97,1814.479,1818.149,Yeah.,53,,
352,0.97,1818.149,1826.191,"I really appreciate you know, that we're going to see in action, the value of Pairing folks that have that lived experience.",53,,
353,0.97,1826.191,1832.864,Like in doing this work to help other folks follow through sort of a similar journey.,53,,
354,0.97,1832.864,1834.732,"I wonder, too, dawn.",53,,
355,0.97,1834.732,1837.602,Because you're on board as a Colead.,53,,
356,0.97,1837.602,1841.673,You said that earlier for the program.,53,,
357,0.97,1841.673,1841.906,Oh.,54,,
358,0.97,1841.906,1843.541,There's three others.,54,,
359,0.97,1843.541,1844.108,Great.,55,,
360,0.97,1844.108,1848.146,"So how--and maybe this is a better question for mark, actually.",55,,
361,0.97,1848.146,1860.258,"But how is that process coming along, in terms of staffing the program up and getting ready to get in on the ground and deploy?",55,,
362,0.97,1860.258,1864.529,"We're--I feel great, actually.",56,,
363,0.97,1864.529,1876.074,"I mean, like we've hired, you know, Shacome on board, actually, at the tail end of January.",56,,
364,0.97,1876.074,1884.649,"And then we've hired, as dawn mentioned, four Codirectors for the peer NAV team.",56,,
365,0.97,1884.649,1894.325,"We will be doing an all-day, actually, a day and a half, like, orientation.",56,,
366,0.97,1894.325,1895.56,Work plan strategies next week.,56,,
367,0.97,1895.56,1903.568,"And then they will, in turn, begin to build out the teams that will be deployed.",56,,
368,0.97,1903.568,1913.077,"And I feel very good about our ability to rapidly hire, once folks are situated and our strategy is locked in.",56,,
369,0.97,1913.077,1915.48,Excellent.,57,,
370,0.97,1915.48,1921.085,So opening it up to colleagues now.,57,,
371,0.97,1921.085,1932.096,Council member Herbold has her hand raised.,57,,
372,0.97,1932.096,1932.664,And Councilmember Mosqueda.,57,,
373,0.97,1932.664,1933.164,Councilmember Herbold.,57,,
374,0.97,1933.164,1934.399,Thank you so much.,58,,
375,0.97,1934.399,1935.033,I have three questions.,58,,
376,0.97,1935.033,1937.335,I want to start there.,58,,
377,0.97,1937.335,1940.972,I want to start with quick comment.,58,,
378,0.97,1940.972,1948.98,I appreciate you talking about the High-Acuity shelter as a little background.,58,,
379,0.97,1948.98,1955.453,The Council provided $5 million towards the opening of a high- Acuity shelter.,58,,
380,0.97,1955.453,1962.126,"And I understand--we have been tracking its progress, the legislation's progress over at King County.",58,,
381,0.97,1962.126,1966.23,I understand it's going to be referred later this week.,58,,
382,0.97,1966.23,1970.168,And hopefully it will be heard soon after that.,58,,
383,0.97,1970.168,1973.671,And my question is actually four questions.,58,,
384,0.97,1973.671,1974.238,But in order first.,58,,
385,0.97,1974.238,1985.516,"As it relates to the Prioritization process, I understand that Rha is introducing long-overdue changes from the prior tool.",58,,
386,0.97,1985.516,2004.802,"But differently from that, just trying to understand whether or not people living unsheltered, who are served by partnership for zero will be Prioritize within coordinated entry, among people who are already in the system, waiting for housing, but not, not living a shelter downtown.",58,,
387,0.97,2004.802,2007.739,"If so, how is that going to work?",58,,
388,0.97,2007.739,2018.683,"That's the Prioritization to get to another location, as it relates to the shelter turnover assumptions, wanting to--I'm sorry.",58,,
389,0.97,2018.683,2021.185,Next is the shelter bed availability.,58,,
390,0.97,2021.185,2037.468,"Wondering how many beds do you anticipate will still be available for the hope team or other providers to offer to other Encampments on an average day, outside of the partnership for zero?",58,,
391,0.97,2037.468,2046.21,"If, in fact, large blocks of vacancies are going to be required on a daily basis to serve the partnership for zero clients.",58,,
392,0.97,2046.21,2055.553,"On the shelter turnover assumptions, just wondering what your assumptions are, about shelter, purpose of housing capacity.",58,,
393,0.97,2055.553,2069.233,Are you--do you have a sort of a ballpark on the number of new beds or units that will become available during that 10- month period of time.,58,,
394,0.97,2069.233,2076.441,If you have an estimate of how long folks will stay in that location before moving on?,58,,
395,0.97,2076.441,2081.079,"And then Lastly, I guess it's more of a comment.",58,,
396,0.97,2081.079,2083.247,"Well, there's a question in here.",58,,
397,0.97,2083.247,2084.048,What?,58,,
398,0.97,2084.048,2088.486,I don't understand how we're defining functional zero.,58,,
399,0.97,2088.486,2096.06,"I've--before this was announced, I had expressed some concerns about naming the partnership.",58,,
400,0.97,2096.06,2097.929,Partnership for zero.,58,,
401,0.97,2097.929,2110.641,Because I think it results in potentially people expecting to see zero tents within the geographic area and zero people living unsheltered downtown.,58,,
402,0.97,2110.641,2116.948,"So just trying to understand, what exactly do we mean when we say ""functional zero""?",58,,
403,0.97,2116.948,2123.287,Thanks.,58,,
404,0.97,2123.287,2125.156,I can start.,59,,
405,0.97,2125.156,2128.226,"And team, jump in anywhere I'm off.",59,,
406,0.97,2128.226,2139.003,"So on Prioritization, as of right now, and I'm talking closely with the coordinated entry team here about the spread.",59,,
407,0.97,2139.003,2152.383,"As of right now, I don't think we'll need to do any additional Prioritization because of the nature of the people sheltered down downtown.",59,,
408,0.97,2152.383,2154.852,The people unsheltered downtown are chronically homeless.,59,,
409,0.97,2154.852,2155.92,"Have significant need, right?",59,,
410,0.97,2155.92,2164.195,"So once they are in the coordinated entry system, our Prioritized in that way.",59,,
411,0.97,2164.195,2166.864,"To that end, I will thank you.",59,,
412,0.97,2166.864,2176.173,In terms of recognizing that we are changing how Prioritization works in the community.,59,,
413,0.97,2176.173,2180.645,"And we have formally let go, there the likely be more changes to come.",59,,
414,0.97,2180.645,2187.251,"We recognize that the Covid Prioritization framework that we have been working with, while better, is still not perfect.",59,,
415,0.97,2187.251,2194.725,And we look forward to working with community to create something that is Iteratively better still.,59,,
416,0.97,2194.725,2197.595,On shelter bed availability.,59,,
417,0.97,2197.595,2199.764,Multipart answer.,59,,
418,0.97,2199.764,2215.313,"So one, my, you know, sort of baseline analysis that I'm working off of, from our team, is that shelter bed turnover is roughly 12 to 18 per month.",59,,
419,0.97,2215.313,2225.323,"And I don't expect that we will, you know, suddenly see some sort of increased turnover in the current beds.",59,,
420,0.97,2225.323,2225.556,Right?,59,,
421,0.97,2225.556,2232.463,"I do think that people who are partnership for zero clients, if they go into shelter.",59,,
422,0.97,2232.463,2234.932,"I think they might move through faster, to be honest.",59,,
423,0.97,2234.932,2239.737,That's one of the things we are saying is possible with navigator support.,59,,
424,0.97,2239.737,2253.317,"Is that like, you're able to move through this system faster, because you're not going through a whole bunch of transitions, in terms of, you know, who is your person, and how they're able to support you.",59,,
425,0.97,2253.317,2263.294,The hope team will still have access to the beds that are designated through the Set- asides.,59,,
426,0.97,2263.294,2263.828,There is no change there.,59,,
427,0.97,2263.828,2269.433,"I will also add, we do expect new shelter to come Online.",59,,
428,0.97,2269.433,2269.667,Right?,59,,
429,0.97,2269.667,2273.471,"So I think today, I checked in with Peter.",59,,
430,0.97,2273.471,2275.673,We're making award phone calls today.,59,,
431,0.97,2275.673,2277.141,I hope I'm not speaking out of turn.,59,,
432,0.97,2277.141,2279.71,"Because if I did, I just said that publicly.",59,,
433,0.97,2279.71,2281.746,But I did ask him before I came here.,59,,
434,0.97,2281.746,2283.681,So I should be allowed to say that.,59,,
435,0.97,2283.681,2302.867,"So between awards that we will make, expected Online of things in terms of Soto and other shelter investments, we expect to be able to make, through Unallocated resources that we are building our piece for right now, we will have more shelter this year.",59,,
436,0.97,2302.867,2305.302,That is just true.,59,,
437,0.97,2305.302,2322.853,"And certainly as we get to budget, my governing committee members, we will also be continuing to recommend additional investments in both, you know, shelter Subtubes, like that high Accuity work.",59,,
438,0.97,2322.853,2331.629,"But also just, we have 45,000 people who are Unstably housed, and we need a shelter system that is commensurate with that need.",59,,
439,0.97,2331.629,2334.999,"And the last question, I think I wrote them down.",59,,
440,0.97,2334.999,2337.201,So hopefully I am getting all of them.,59,,
441,0.97,2337.201,2340.571,Is on the functional zero.,59,,
442,0.97,2340.571,2344.909,"And I will confess my own, you know.",59,,
443,0.97,2344.909,2351.048,I like things that are a little bit more straightforward.,59,,
444,0.97,2351.048,2353.484,Functional zero is the federally recognized thing.,59,,
445,0.97,2353.484,2356.387,So that's what I'm going with.,59,,
446,0.97,2356.387,2361.525,So communities can be certified by the Feds as having attained functional zero.,59,,
447,0.97,2361.525,2366.997,So that is part of the reason why that is the benchmark across the field.,59,,
448,0.97,2366.997,2376.407,"What it means is that you know, on--you--you drive towards hopefully, right?",59,,
449,0.97,2376.407,2382.113,"As low a number as you can get, on the number of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness.",59,,
450,0.97,2382.113,2388.219,For us in that downtown core work.,59,,
451,0.97,2388.219,2390.521,That that is a Sub50 number.,59,,
452,0.97,2390.521,2390.821,Right?,59,,
453,0.97,2390.821,2391.722,And then you hold it.,59,,
454,0.97,2391.722,2393.791,And holding it means as new people show up.,59,,
455,0.97,2393.791,2400.03,The same number of people who show up has to be like the same number of people who are exited.,59,,
456,0.97,2400.03,2403.834,"In whatever time frame you're using to denote, right?",59,,
457,0.97,2403.834,2414.745,"Some of the more finely tuned and granular data systems, across the country, are able to do sort of weekly Samplings, right?",59,,
458,0.97,2414.745,2418.682,"I think by having a downtown a list, we should be able to do the same thing.",59,,
459,0.97,2418.682,2423.554,"And say, Hey, if folks are coming, let's say five folks come in, right?",59,,
460,0.97,2423.554,2432.062,"We need to be making sure that five folks are being exited into, you know, stable placements for a week as well.",59,,
461,0.97,2432.062,2432.797,"And that if, right?",59,,
462,0.97,2432.797,2437.368,Like that number that we hit and our holding is okay.,59,,
463,0.97,2437.368,2443.641,"At any given day, there are roughly 30 people, experiencing unsheltered homelessness in the downtown core.",59,,
464,0.97,2443.641,2447.211,"That is down from about 850, right?",59,,
465,0.97,2447.211,2452.683,"And the reality that we are in, and I actually thank you for asking this question.",59,,
466,0.97,2452.683,2454.585,Because it allows me to say this.,59,,
467,0.97,2454.585,2454.819,Again.,59,,
468,0.97,2454.819,2464.228,"The reality that we are in, is that the Stemmatic drivers that lead to people being in the downtown shelters, are not going anywhere, right?",59,,
469,0.97,2464.228,2467.298,I was walking back from something just last night.,59,,
470,0.97,2467.298,2473.337,"And I saw a young man who clearly had just been released from the Correctional facility, and didn't look like he had anywhere to go.",59,,
471,0.97,2473.337,2474.438,And that is not going anywhere.,59,,
472,0.97,2474.438,2477.775,Right?,59,,
473,0.97,2477.775,2490.154,"And so the vision, in partnership for zero is that I would have been able to literally take out my phone and say, Hey, I'm going to like grab a minute to talk to this person.",59,,
474,0.97,2490.154,2500.264,"Can someone meet me at this intersection, so that we are connecting him with someplace to sleep tonight?",59,,
475,0.97,2500.264,2501.465,Yeah.,60,,
476,0.97,2501.465,2502.366,Herbold.,61,,
477,0.97,2502.366,2504.335,If you have a follow-up.,62,,
478,0.97,2504.335,2506.003,Thank you.,63,,
479,0.97,2506.003,2512.076,So I completely understand that the numbers may not be available at this moment.,63,,
480,0.97,2512.076,2519.817,"But I can't--we know, we have an estimate of the number of unsheltered homeless people who are living downtown.",63,,
481,0.97,2519.817,2523.754,We have a target of 10 months.,63,,
482,0.97,2523.754,2527.024,So there are some numerical assumptions here.,63,,
483,0.97,2527.024,2534.431,"And I would like to know, again, the number of new shelter beds that we expect to become available at this time.",63,,
484,0.97,2534.431,2538.869,And the amount of time--I appreciate that we expect it to be less than currently.,63,,
485,0.97,2538.869,2544.041,"But the amount of time, number of days they'll stay in shelter before moving.",63,,
486,0.97,2544.041,2554.051,"And then also, how many beds are going to be available for both, you're saying no difference for the hope team or other providers.",63,,
487,0.97,2554.051,2556.921,But what is the number on the average--I guess.,63,,
488,0.97,2556.921,2562.092,Number of beds that are available a day?,63,,
489,0.97,2562.092,2579.343,"And I'm just having a little bit of a hard time understanding the answer that it's going to be the same number for Nonpartnership for zero clients, if the partnership for zero clients are also drying from that number.",63,,
490,0.97,2579.343,2583.48,Coats so let's try to clear that up Offline.,63,,
491,0.97,2583.48,2600.297,"And then I do want to just flag that in the answer to my Prioritization question, the folks that you are describing as being highly Prioritized, who live downtown.",63,,
492,0.97,2600.297,2600.631,You're right.,63,,
493,0.97,2600.631,2601.732,They will be highly Prioritized.,63,,
494,0.97,2601.732,2608.772,"But there are other people like them who don't live downtown, they are also highly Prioritized already in the system.",63,,
495,0.97,2608.772,2615.245,"So what I'm asking is, are the people downtown through partnership for zero.",63,,
496,0.97,2615.245,2618.682,When they are equally highly Prioritized with people who are already in the system.,63,,
497,0.97,2618.682,2620.651,How are we going to treat that?,63,,
498,0.97,2620.651,2623.22,And I appreciate that.,64,,
499,0.97,2623.22,2627.124,"I'm happy to follow up, looking at time, we can set up time with your office.",64,,
500,0.97,2627.124,2629.927,"Does that work for you, Councilmember?",64,,
501,0.97,2629.927,2631.428,It definitely does.,65,,
502,0.97,2631.428,2631.729,Thank you.,65,,
503,0.97,2631.729,2632.763,Okay.,66,,
504,0.97,2632.763,2640.571,"O, one thing I would add is on the--I just want to Delineate one thing.",67,,
505,0.97,2640.571,2645.776,Because part of that question should go to my counterparts at H SD.,67,,
506,0.97,2645.776,2651.682,So the bed turnover that I'm referring to is outside of the set aside beds.,67,,
507,0.97,2651.682,2656.153,I do not know the turnover of the set aside beds that I'm aware of.,67,,
508,0.97,2656.153,2660.124,"It's something I can be aware of, but it is not the thing that I monitor.",67,,
509,0.97,2660.124,2669.666,"Thank you so much for that line of questioning, Councilmember Herbold, I see Councilmember Mosqueda has her hand up.",68,,
510,0.97,2669.666,2678.809,"I do want to just touch on one thing that came up, in Councilmember Herbold's line of questioning.",68,,
511,0.97,2678.809,2695.092,"And I think a good line of questions was raised, where Ceo done mentioned somebody seeing someone released without anything at all.",68,,
512,0.97,2695.092,2705.469,"I wonder, not just with this initiative, but the extent of conversation around Reentry work.",68,,
513,0.97,2705.469,2716.48,And whether that is a niche that Hrca is potentially interested in participating in.,68,,
514,0.97,2716.48,2719.283,Since that is the asymmetry of downtown.,68,,
515,0.97,2719.283,2725.122,"That we do no Reentry work whatsoever, from the King County jail to the street.",68,,
516,0.97,2725.122,2730.761,"And if, you know, given that both of these authorities are somewhat housed in the county, right?",68,,
517,0.97,2730.761,2736.233,Like if there have been some of those discussions and?,68,,
518,0.97,2736.233,2744.775,"Strategic thinking around that, because that could be an opportunity for, you know, at least a warm Handoff of an offer, of some kind of assistance.",68,,
519,0.97,2744.775,2750.28,"Obviously, once people are free from the King County jail, they're free to do as they choose.",68,,
520,0.97,2750.28,2761.391,"But if there was some kind of opportunity to, you know, not have to wait to find that person, a couple of days later, after being in squalor downtown for several days.",68,,
521,0.97,2761.391,2763.36,It might be an interesting opportunity to explore.,68,,
522,0.97,2763.36,2768.966,But I don't know where those conversations are.,68,,
523,0.97,2768.966,2773.303,"You're muted, mark.",68,,
524,0.97,2773.303,2774.338,Once a quarter.,69,,
525,0.97,2774.338,2780.21,[Laughter] so I will say.,69,,
526,0.97,2780.21,2793.791,"And you know, we, internally, we have identified that gap, and then the gap from the Healthcare system and some of our hospitals situated around the downtown port.",69,,
527,0.97,2793.791,2796.326,Right?,69,,
528,0.97,2796.326,2803.367,"As core, like systemic drivers that we need to have a level of planning around.",69,,
529,0.97,2803.367,2823.153,"I think that, you know, our hope is that we will get to a place where we, you know, think about the discharge, or Reentry planning space, as again being connected to an Ecosystem of peers, where like, those folks are saying, this person is about to be released, can someone meet them?",69,,
530,0.97,2823.153,2825.923,"Or can you help to architect that path, right?",69,,
531,0.97,2825.923,2832.93,"I will say, like you know, our orientation here is like, we just want to see people housed.",69,,
532,0.97,2832.93,2834.298,And no one sleeping outside.,69,,
533,0.97,2834.298,2842.206,"So if those institutions want to lean in to us, as like helping to do that planning, we are happy to do that.",69,,
534,0.97,2842.206,2846.61,And we are not yet at a place--but I want to be clear.,69,,
535,0.97,2846.61,2852.082,We are not yet at a place of conversation.,69,,
536,0.97,2852.082,2853.584,We had some preliminary conversation.,69,,
537,0.97,2853.584,2854.418,But very preliminary.,69,,
538,0.97,2854.418,2857.788,"And spurred on by Covid, frankly.",69,,
539,0.97,2857.788,2865.996,"And you know, Shea is one of the folks you will lead on tightening that integration, as a body of work that they will shepherd.",69,,
540,0.97,2865.996,2874.838,"And then I think that on the criminal legal system side, you know, I think we need to do a little bit more focus work there.",69,,
541,0.97,2874.838,2892.723,"And certainly I think, you know, our colleagues at the PDA and lead and some of the other programs that have been in that space for quite sometime, we look forward to Partnering really deeply with on crafting whatever that strategy is.",69,,
542,0.97,2892.723,2892.99,Great.,70,,
543,0.97,2892.99,2893.19,Yes.,70,,
544,0.97,2893.19,2898.395,And we look forward to working with you guys on integrating as much that was work as possible.,70,,
545,0.97,2898.395,2901.798,"So it's working together, rather than at cross points.",70,,
546,0.97,2901.798,2906.37,So that's great to hear.,70,,
547,0.97,2906.37,2909.306,"Councilmember Mosqueda, your questions.",70,,
548,0.97,2909.306,2910.741,Thank you very much.,71,,
549,0.97,2910.741,2922.886,"I feel like I just need to, at the beginning of all of the conversations that we have with the community about regional homelessness authority, folks might hear the title, King County regional homeless authority.",71,,
550,0.97,2922.886,2931.862,But I want to take this again as a chance to say that Seattle has not only supported the King County homelessness authority.,71,,
551,0.97,2931.862,2936.5,This is truly a separate entity from King County.,71,,
552,0.97,2936.5,2939.936,And Seattle is contributing 68% of the budget currently.,71,,
553,0.97,2939.936,2960.991,"So I wanted just to underscore the important partnership that we have here, and I really appreciate the time that we get to ask questions and showcase to the community the work that you all are doing in partnership with the King County Council, us, and hopefully soon more of the regional cities who can Becontributing to this.",71,,
554,0.97,2960.991,2966.263,But just in case there is any confusion whether or not Seattle is stepping up.,71,,
555,0.97,2966.263,2970.801,Stepping up at 68% to make sure our Rha is supported.,71,,
556,0.97,2970.801,2976.039,"And also, mark, I want to say thank you for being here.",71,,
557,0.97,2976.039,2977.808,I know you must be tired.,71,,
558,0.97,2977.808,2980.877,I heard the entire presentation on K.O.W.,71,,
559,0.97,2980.877,2984.214,I know you spent sometime talking to folks on these systems already.,71,,
560,0.97,2984.214,2991.989,"And appreciate that one of the callers or one of the questions asked of you was about, what do we do for folks who shouldn't be allowed downtown.",71,,
561,0.97,2991.989,3011.742,"And you had a very clear answer, that from a values perspective, it's not Rha's perspective or your perspective, that we should not allow any human in any place, no matter where that parcel is, and that we ought to be working in coordination to be getting those people inside.",71,,
562,0.97,3011.742,3018.081,And I share that value to make sure folks are not living in the elements.,71,,
563,0.97,3018.081,3021.351,But that does not mean allowing them somewhere.,71,,
564,0.97,3021.351,3024.488,But instead getting them into healthy shelters and then housing.,71,,
565,0.97,3024.488,3028.625,"But it brought up a question for me, about what is currently happening.",71,,
566,0.97,3028.625,3034.464,"And if what is currently happening, as reported out there, is that there are Sweeps happening downtown.",71,,
567,0.97,3034.464,3039.202,"And some like the one on fourth Avenue, what was reported was that there was an hour or two notice.",71,,
568,0.97,3039.202,3041.304,That is going to cause people to move.,71,,
569,0.97,3041.304,3045.242,"And as you Nolted in your interview, in K.O.W.",71,,
570,0.97,3045.242,3056.186,"Sometimes this relationship that you're trying to build, with existing outreach partners, or with the peer navigators that you're planning on bringing on, it takes not months, but a matter of weeks.",71,,
571,0.97,3056.186,3062.859,"But you still need at least a few weeks or a week, not two hours, to be able to create the relationship with folks.",71,,
572,0.97,3062.859,3069.833,"I'm really worried that the model that you're talking about isn't going to work, if you don't have that time to do outreach.",71,,
573,0.97,3069.833,3085.081,"So is there a coordinated effort to work with the regional homelessness authority, to do outreach, over a set period of time like I think was done successfully to a large degree in Ballard Commons.",71,,
574,0.97,3085.081,3089.152,So that you all have the time to do that outreach.,71,,
575,0.97,3089.152,3096.293,Because the consequence is they're either going to move make maybe into other places of downtown Seattle or move into areas outside of downtown Seattle.,71,,
576,0.97,3096.293,3101.498,And I've already seen more and more tents around what had been car and Rv spaces.,71,,
577,0.97,3101.498,3109.306,Maybe people feel a sense of safety coming into that street because there's already people there.,71,,
578,0.97,3109.306,3113.21,But that just means that the homeless community is going to be broader than downtown.,71,,
579,0.97,3113.21,3125.355,"So what is the strategy to make sure folks are not moving to other places downtown or other areas of the community, so you all can successfully get folks inside.",71,,
580,0.97,3125.355,3125.989,I appreciate this question.,72,,
581,0.97,3125.989,3127.591,"So you know, a couple of things.",72,,
582,0.97,3127.591,3136.933,"One, I think, you know, we are in good, ongoing conversation, like yesterday, today.",72,,
583,0.97,3136.933,3144.474,"I'm sure tomorrow, with our colleagues, both at H SD and the Mayor's office.",72,,
584,0.97,3144.474,3153.483,"And, you know, what--we don't necessarily always agree on, like every specific way forward.",72,,
585,0.97,3153.483,3157.354,But we do agree on the end goals.,72,,
586,0.97,3157.354,3160.557,And we are very clear that the shared alignment.,72,,
587,0.97,3160.557,3160.79,Right?,72,,
588,0.97,3160.79,3163.126,We are going to find the path that best supports everyone.,72,,
589,0.97,3163.126,3165.195,"You know, I think that our goal.",72,,
590,0.97,3165.195,3167.03,And I will just speak for the authority.,72,,
591,0.97,3167.03,3170.834,Our goal is to get to what you described.,72,,
592,0.97,3170.834,3172.302,"In having that lead time, right?",72,,
593,0.97,3172.302,3175.138,"I do want to be very clear, though.",72,,
594,0.97,3175.138,3178.508,"That, like, where that lead time is not our call.",72,,
595,0.97,3178.508,3184.447,"And may not be possible, is where there are significant issues of safety.",72,,
596,0.97,3184.447,3192.222,"And frankly, in many of those instances, our staff are the folks who flag it, right?",72,,
597,0.97,3192.222,3194.424,There is significant concern here around safety.,72,,
598,0.97,3194.424,3195.492,But beyond that.,72,,
599,0.97,3195.492,3205.902,"I will just say, right, that like what I would like to be able to get to is an Ecosystem, where we are able to, you know, have a couple of weeks, right?",72,,
600,0.97,3205.902,3210.34,"I think to your point, of lead time around.",72,,
601,0.97,3210.34,3210.74,Engaging people.,72,,
602,0.97,3210.74,3214.578,Developing a clear understanding of what their needs are and supporting their placements.,72,,
603,0.97,3214.578,3218.748,And I think that I really do.,72,,
604,0.97,3218.748,3221.885,And I see deputy director Bailey has come on camera.,72,,
605,0.97,3221.885,3223.32,Perhaps he wants to add to this.,72,,
606,0.97,3223.32,3227.691,But I really feel like we are days away from that.,72,,
607,0.97,3227.691,3230.827,And it's about--I just froze.,72,,
608,0.97,3230.827,3232.629,I can still see.,73,,
609,0.97,3232.629,3232.996,"Okay, great.",74,,
610,0.97,3232.996,3237.2,"[Laughter] thank you, Councilmember.",74,,
611,0.97,3237.2,3238.201,"I was like, Oh, no.",74,,
612,0.97,3238.201,3239.035,I don't know.,74,,
613,0.97,3239.035,3241.171,I'm just going to keep talking.,74,,
614,0.97,3241.171,3247.277,So I think we are days away from having clarity around what that coordination looks like.,74,,
615,0.97,3247.277,3262.092,"I think that you know, Heidi could speak to how we are standing up, the unified command center, and you know, beginning to root those exchanges and information, et cetera.",74,,
616,0.97,3262.092,3265.895,But I think we are headed in the right direction is the sum answer.,74,,
617,0.97,3265.895,3266.162,Okay.,75,,
618,0.97,3266.162,3267.864,And it's nice to meet you.,75,,
619,0.97,3267.864,3271.167,"Deputy Mayor, I don't think we've had the chance to meet yet.",75,,
620,0.97,3271.167,3277.774,"But I think the Mayor's office, potentially would say that they did give two weeks' notice, right?",75,,
621,0.97,3277.774,3281.945,"That there was a post being two weeks before the move, the sweep.",75,,
622,0.97,3281.945,3285.415,So I guess I'm glad to hear the conversations are happening.,75,,
623,0.97,3285.415,3293.39,"But will it be something like if a post goes up immediately or in advance, there's already conversation with Rha.",75,,
624,0.97,3293.39,3296.793,So that you're not having to Chase where a post is.,75,,
625,0.97,3296.793,3300.997,But that you are operate being through this command and dispatch system.,75,,
626,0.97,3300.997,3303.933,I'm sure I'm using the wrong terms.,75,,
627,0.97,3303.933,3305.902,The emergency dispatch control system that you're talking about.,75,,
628,0.97,3305.902,3316.246,"Will that be the place where you're sharing information, so that a post never goes up without Rha, N knowing about it and already having outreach on the floor, on the ground?",75,,
629,0.97,3316.246,3316.78,Yeah.,76,,
630,0.97,3316.78,3317.147,That's correct.,76,,
631,0.97,3317.147,3317.547,That's the goal.,76,,
632,0.97,3317.547,3321.151,Is that like when a posting happens.,76,,
633,0.97,3321.151,3328.925,"That we know, right, that that is a priority space for whatever reason that the city has flagged as a priority space.",76,,
634,0.97,3328.925,3331.528,"And to be honest, like I don't necessarily need to know why.",76,,
635,0.97,3331.528,3337.3,"Just tell me that you need our support, right?",76,,
636,0.97,3337.3,3337.734,And we'll be there.,76,,
637,0.97,3337.734,3339.569,So that is the vision.,76,,
638,0.97,3339.569,3358.188,"I believe deputy director Bailey and interim director Kim and deputy Mayor Washington a lot of times, all share that vision of being able to be in sync, where we know that a thing is coming.",76,,
639,0.97,3358.188,3365.628,"And are actively in the process of supporting people so that you know, we are getting people placed.",76,,
640,0.97,3365.628,3371.101,"As you know, how we resolve an encampment.",76,,
641,0.97,3371.101,3376.139,And that the displacement strategies are not the ones that we are leading into.,76,,
642,0.97,3376.139,3381.745,"And I think just to close the Loop on this, I have to correct myself.",77,,
643,0.97,3381.745,3389.652,"Because I just said, you know, you will be there when a posting happens.",77,,
644,0.97,3389.652,3395.558,"But going back, two, three, four, what we were really concerned with was when the posting goes up.",77,,
645,0.97,3395.558,3397.26,That causes folks to move.,77,,
646,0.97,3397.26,3399.729,"So Ideally, there would never be a post.",77,,
647,0.97,3399.729,3405.034,"It would be the outreach and organization to get folks to a safer, healthier, shelter or house.",77,,
648,0.97,3405.034,3409.873,And then a posting doesn't happen that creates --,77,,
649,0.97,3409.873,3410.14,Right.,78,,
650,0.97,3410.14,3429.125,"And I think what we're working on, not to, you know, tip the hat, but what we're working on, frankly, bailed on a letter that you sent, Councilmember, not--from a couple of years ago, actually.",78,,
651,0.97,3429.125,3435.665,Is a way of like creating a clear Prioritization schema.,78,,
652,0.97,3435.665,3439.769,That we all agree on.,78,,
653,0.97,3439.769,3447.343,"And are continuously evaluating, so that we're saying Oh, this encampment is a priority one, Becausee have health and safety issues.",78,,
654,0.97,3447.343,3447.577,Right?,78,,
655,0.97,3447.577,3454.117,"So we need to rapidly get to know those folks and support them, you know, moving inside.",78,,
656,0.97,3454.117,3461.458,"Or this Erncampment is a priority, too, et cetera, right?",78,,
657,0.97,3461.458,3463.793,Because it falls into these Prioritization factors.,78,,
658,0.97,3463.793,3469.699,"So I think--and I think again, we are days away from being able to really move forward on that.",78,,
659,0.97,3469.699,3485.582,"And I think that it is the goal of H SD, the authority and the Mayor's office, to be in sync around what that is, how it is created, to get outreach to weigh in on it, to get the L.A.C.",78,,
660,0.97,3485.582,3486.249,To weigh in on it.,78,,
661,0.97,3486.249,3494.524,"And that's where we are now is getting the community input to make sure we haven't missed anything, that we're headed in the right direction.",78,,
662,0.97,3494.524,3500.964,"And then we'll move forward with having a clear way of being able to say, this is how Prioritization works and what we are doing.",78,,
663,0.97,3500.964,3510.273,"And then the authority will simply be moving through the Prioritization schema, too.",78,,
664,0.97,3510.273,3511.14,Right?,78,,
665,0.97,3511.14,3525.288,"So we won't ever be you know, I think, surprised, like the city RAISES, like we're concerned about the folks here, because of X, Y, or Z'Er issues, because we should be working towards resolution.",78,,
666,0.97,3525.288,3529.259,"Thank you so much, panel.",79,,
667,0.97,3529.259,3532.929,"I understand mark, you have a kind of hard stop here at 3:00.",79,,
668,0.97,3532.929,3535.298,And I think we can accommodate that.,79,,
669,0.97,3535.298,3538.801,I think we have gotten all through right on time.,79,,
670,0.97,3538.801,3541.437,Really appreciate the panel today.,79,,
671,0.97,3541.437,3542.705,Appreciate this update.,79,,
672,0.97,3542.705,3552.081,Looking forward to hopefully having you guys back maybe sometime in the next quarter to give the next update on where we are with this work.,79,,
673,0.97,3552.081,3553.249,But super excited.,79,,
674,0.97,3553.249,3556.486,And appreciate getting the detailed briefing.,79,,
675,0.97,3556.486,3557.353,"I appreciate that, chair.",80,,
676,0.97,3557.353,3561.557,And I apologize for the hard stop.,80,,
677,0.97,3561.557,3565.094,I have to go speak with another elected colleague.,80,,
678,0.97,3565.094,3566.963,So I want to be respectful.,80,,
679,0.97,3566.963,3569.465,But we look forward to the opportunity to brief you again.,80,,
680,0.97,3569.465,3574.103,"And of course, to keep you updated.",80,,
681,0.97,3574.103,3580.777,"And Councilmember Herbold, we will reach out to your office to schedule something.",80,,
682,0.97,3580.777,3581.044,Great.,81,,
683,0.97,3581.044,3585.348,And that's actually a good transition.,81,,
684,0.97,3585.348,3591.254,Councilmember Mosqueda's line of questioning to our next agenda item.,81,,
685,0.97,3591.254,3593.823,So I look forward to this presentation as well.,81,,
686,0.97,3593.823,3599.028,"And Mr. clerk, would you please EAD into the record, agenda item 2?",81,,
687,0.97,3599.028,3602.799,Agenda item number 2.,82,,
688,0.97,3602.799,3605.101,"Hope team 2021, quarterly reports.",82,,
689,0.97,3605.101,3607.27,Excellent.,83,,
690,0.97,3607.27,3613.843,"And we are joined here by Michael Bailey, from human services Department.",83,,
691,0.97,3613.843,3618.448,We've also got Jeff Sims from our Council central staff.,83,,
692,0.97,3618.448,3618.815,And Mr. Bailey.,83,,
693,0.97,3618.815,3622.518,I don't know if you want to just kind of go first to sort of Cue up.,83,,
694,0.97,3622.518,3627.69,I don't know if you're being joined by other colleagues or not.,83,,
695,0.97,3627.69,3634.43,But to sort of Cue up the present aged.,83,,
696,0.97,3634.43,3639.769,"And Jeff, if you could maybe give some central comments of that conclusion before Council presents.",83,,
697,0.97,3639.769,3641.771,That's the way I want to structure this.,83,,
698,0.97,3641.771,3645.475,"So Mr. Bailey, why don't you go ahead and kick things off?",83,,
699,0.97,3645.475,3652.448,And we will hold our questions until the conclusion of your presentation?,83,,
700,0.97,3652.448,3652.782,All right.,84,,
701,0.97,3652.782,3655.318,"Well, hopefully folks can see the screen.",84,,
702,0.97,3655.318,3659.789,I'm looking for a head nod from anybody.,84,,
703,0.97,3659.789,3660.056,Perfect.,84,,
704,0.97,3660.056,3660.356,All right.,84,,
705,0.97,3660.356,3661.19,"Well, good afternoon, everyone.",84,,
706,0.97,3661.19,3663.826,"My name is Michael Bailey, for the record.",84,,
707,0.97,3663.826,3672.201,I have the pleasure and privilege of serving as the deputy director here at the Seattle human services Department.,84,,
708,0.97,3672.201,3672.435,Or Hsd.,84,,
709,0.97,3672.435,3682.545,"The portfolio that I manage here at the Department includes the city's homelessness investments, thus my presence here today.",84,,
710,0.97,3682.545,3685.515,"I am a Newbie, my first time approaching the committee.",84,,
711,0.97,3685.515,3688.918,"With that being said, you have my full permission to take it easy on me today.",84,,
712,0.97,3688.918,3690.853,But it's going to be a great discussion.,84,,
713,0.97,3690.853,3693.356,And I'm excited to have the community.,84,,
714,0.97,3693.356,3701.064,"I'd like to thank community chair Lewis, and vice chair Mosqueda and the committee as a whole.",84,,
715,0.97,3701.064,3713.576,"And as part of my time today, I plan to present on the 2021 outcomes for H SD's hope team.",84,,
716,0.97,3713.576,3714.477,All right.,84,,
717,0.97,3714.477,3718.715,So our agenda for today's presentation looks a little bit like this.,84,,
718,0.97,3718.715,3721.317,We'll begin with a brief introduction.,84,,
719,0.97,3721.317,3732.662,We'll provide an overview of the hope team and how it functions to providing the city's response to the homeless.,84,,
720,0.97,3732.662,3733.296,We'll cover the report.,84,,
721,0.97,3733.296,3756.018,"And Lastly, I'll provide a general update to let the team know how we are currently and how we're entering a human services relational approach and the city's future hope to address homelessness.",84,,
722,0.97,3756.018,3757.086,Here at the Department.,85,,
723,0.97,3757.086,3762.225,We are here to connect people and resources during their time of need.,85,,
724,0.97,3762.225,3769.899,"When we're successfully executing that mission, the city has the benefit of watching Seattle residents live, learn and work in a strong and healthy community.",85,,
725,0.97,3769.899,3775.004,We encourage our teams to see their work through this human services center lens.,85,,
726,0.97,3775.004,3779.142,And often encourage our peers and external partners to do the same.,85,,
727,0.97,3779.142,3782.678,"Because honestly, this really just allows us to Collaboratively work together.",85,,
728,0.97,3782.678,3785.615,And also just serve both the current and emerging needs.,85,,
729,0.97,3785.615,3800.997,"And while it's true that most of the outreach and service contracts have recently moved from Hsd, over to the new King County regional homelessness authority, addressing homelessness remains one of the Department's six impact areas.",85,,
730,0.97,3800.997,3803.599,The hope team is a reflection of that body of work.,85,,
731,0.97,3803.599,3811.641,"And through their work, connecting people, experiencing homelessness, to shelter in services, this remains a city entity.",85,,
732,0.97,3811.641,3830.092,"And the reason being, it allows the city to meet its legal obligation to comply with the Mdars or specifically, the need to identify and provide alternative shelter, before removing Nonstructured Encampments.",85,,
733,0.97,3830.092,3831.16,And also outreach encampment Removables.,85,,
734,0.97,3831.16,3842.438,"The city is able to shift has liabilities, despite the contracts moving Ttorha.",85,,
735,0.97,3842.438,3848.911,"And has resource i.e., hope team, necessary to do this body work.",85,,
736,0.97,3848.911,3852.048,Either Rha or service providers decline to assist.,85,,
737,0.97,3852.048,3869.665,"And while Hsd is not responsible fore moving Encampments, it is our desire to make sure people living in shelters can be connected to solutions as outlined in our mission.",85,,
738,0.97,3869.665,3869.832,So.,85,,
739,0.97,3869.832,3875.671,The hope team was introduced as part of the 2021 budget.,85,,
740,0.97,3875.671,3880.943,They coordinate outreach and referrals to shelter prior to removal.,85,,
741,0.97,3880.943,3882.578,And also document offices of shelter.,85,,
742,0.97,3882.578,3889.652,"Again, this is done to make sure the city is in compliance with Endars.",85,,
743,0.97,3889.652,3895.691,The team also supports the maintenance of Encampments on public property.,85,,
744,0.97,3895.691,3896.259,For example.,85,,
745,0.97,3896.259,3905.568,"In second half of 2021, the team supported 61 projects such as Sp.U., S.P.R.",85,,
746,0.97,3905.568,3909.405,King County and other holders.,85,,
747,0.97,3909.405,3912.909,I will say that 93% resulted without the need of removal.,85,,
748,0.97,3912.909,3917.813,The hope is to prevent the city's front line severe weather response.,85,,
749,0.97,3917.813,3921.617,"In our previous conversation, they talked about treating an emergency like an emergency.",85,,
750,0.97,3921.617,3923.886,And I love that philosophy.,85,,
751,0.97,3923.886,3928.291,"In 2021, the team responded to three significant weather events.",85,,
752,0.97,3928.291,3929.892,The snow event in February.,85,,
753,0.97,3929.892,3933.696,"The heat event in June, and also the cold and snow event in December.",85,,
754,0.97,3933.696,3938.834,"We'll say that each of these events displayed extremes, in terms of weather.",85,,
755,0.97,3938.834,3942.071,But each event had the assistance of this team.,85,,
756,0.97,3942.071,3951.914,"Some folks participated in the field, by conducting welfare checks and supporting basic needs, while we had a few others, assisting who were just sharing information.",85,,
757,0.97,3951.914,3956.118,And that could be as it relatives to emergency shelter or a day center.,85,,
758,0.97,3956.118,3961.857,They also assisted with transportation and also with the distribution of winter weather supplies.,85,,
759,0.97,3961.857,3969.198,"The last bullet is really just a reminder, because once again, I believe most folks already know this.",85,,
760,0.97,3969.198,3974.704,But the hope team coordinates at shelter at Encampments that Prioritize the city.,85,,
761,0.97,3974.704,3979.408,We do not Prioritize the sites or remove the Encampments.,85,,
762,0.97,3979.408,3983.679,Our goal is really just to ensure that they have a human services element.,85,,
763,0.97,3983.679,3996.592,"And that folks there at the sites are connected with resources and solutions, again, as outlined by our mission.",85,,
764,0.97,3996.592,3998.327,All Righty.,85,,
765,0.97,3998.327,4004.6,So this slide is intended to talk about the work of our system navigators.,85,,
766,0.97,4004.6,4008.804,Some people may say small but mighty.,85,,
767,0.97,4008.804,4011.474,But I prefer the order of mighty but small.,85,,
768,0.97,4011.474,4015.311,That is exactly what these three system navigators are.,85,,
769,0.97,4015.311,4020.583,In addition to their outreach coordination at sites.,85,,
770,0.97,4020.583,4024.053,They referral through the hope team.,85,,
771,0.97,4024.053,4026.188,And through provider and shelters city wide.,85,,
772,0.97,4026.188,4028.924,They also provide a great deal of time.,85,,
773,0.97,4028.924,4035.865,Really just manually tracking and coordinating bed availability across the shelters that we have the Set- asides for.,85,,
774,0.97,4035.865,4041.47,And this is really just to ensure that the shelters are available for those at a posted site.,85,,
775,0.97,4041.47,4045.274,I believe the future ideal state would be to have this information in Realtime.,85,,
776,0.97,4045.274,4046.909,And mark's team spoke to that.,85,,
777,0.97,4046.909,4050.546,So we are excited about the opportunities there.,85,,
778,0.97,4050.546,4058.454,"As presented currently, there are a few issues and that could stem from just capacity, staff turnover, I.T.",85,,
779,0.97,4058.454,4058.754,Restraints.,85,,
780,0.97,4058.754,4062.558,There's a number of factors that prevent us from getting Realtime data.,85,,
781,0.97,4062.558,4067.763,But we are working with partners to address that and to improve the process.,85,,
782,0.97,4067.763,4080.81,"And just for context, the hope team set aside beds, represent about 30% of the city's funded shelter spaces.",85,,
783,0.97,4080.81,4087.083,The process that you see in front of you is really meant to representative the engagement that takes place at a priority site.,85,,
784,0.97,4087.083,4092.121,And I'll just kind of walk through these for everybody who is listening.,85,,
785,0.97,4092.121,4098.894,"The process begins when an encampment site is identified by the unified care team, Úindustry side inspection.",85,,
786,0.97,4098.894,4102.431,And I recognize that we have folks listening.,85,,
787,0.97,4102.431,4112.942,"Just for public awareness, the unified care team is essentially the city's Multidepartmental approach, to addressing the impacts of homelessness, throughout the city of Seattle.",85,,
788,0.97,4112.942,4113.309,Moving along.,85,,
789,0.97,4113.309,4124.053,"Once a site is Prioritized by the city, the hope team begins to process a coordinating outreach to the encampment.",85,,
790,0.97,4124.053,4128.724,"For process typically starts, one of our navigators is doing a specific site assessment.",85,,
791,0.97,4128.724,4135.965,That assessment is used to develop a comprehensive list of just all persons encamped at that particular site.,85,,
792,0.97,4135.965,4140.269,"Information about those persons are also collected, if shared by the individual.",85,,
793,0.97,4140.269,4142.638,And we typically call that list a by names list.,85,,
794,0.97,4142.638,4147.209,This is often done in partnership with outreach providers.,85,,
795,0.97,4147.209,4154.416,"But if an outreach provider declines to assist, then it's typically, the system navigator doing this work independently.",85,,
796,0.97,4154.416,4158.521,And that could be through routine Conversationless.,85,,
797,0.97,4158.521,4159.722,Or through routine site visits.,85,,
798,0.97,4159.722,4169.632,"As we move along, the outreach providers and/or the hope team, begin the process of making referrals, to shelter, as Aailability allows.",85,,
799,0.97,4169.632,4178.707,"If a site is later posted for removal, the system navigators provide offers for shelter, leading up to and on the day of removal.",85,,
800,0.97,4178.707,4183.279,"Again, we do not remove the encampment efforts.",85,,
801,0.97,4183.279,4192.254,We are literally there to ensure that offers are done with the human service centered approach.,85,,
802,0.97,4192.254,4193.856,Councilmember Mosqueda represents Ballard.,85,,
803,0.97,4193.856,4197.526,"That's really how this works, is intended to play out.",85,,
804,0.97,4197.526,4201.43,"There, the hope team partnered with reach.",85,,
805,0.97,4201.43,4203.299,Catholic community services.,85,,
806,0.97,4203.299,4205.301,I object Scoff law mitigation team.,85,,
807,0.97,4205.301,4206.101,Over a number of months.,85,,
808,0.97,4206.101,4207.836,And that was really a collaborative effort.,85,,
809,0.97,4207.836,4219.148,"And as a result of that effort, we were able to refer 70 individuals to shelter, prior to the encampment removal.",85,,
810,0.97,4219.148,4226.689,Another example worth mentioning could potential leap be what took place at Dexter.,85,,
811,0.97,4226.689,4230.125,This could take place with the urban lead League.,85,,
812,0.97,4230.125,4241.503,"They used this approach and were able to facilitate approximately 25 Referrallals, again before the removal of that encampment.",85,,
813,0.97,4241.503,4243.572,"Michael, can I just jump in for a second.",86,,
814,0.97,4243.572,4246.041,I know I said I would hold questions.,86,,
815,0.97,4246.041,4249.345,I think this is an important slide just to clarify.,86,,
816,0.97,4249.345,4261.89,"For the illustrations you just made about kind of where on this chart something like Ballard Commons, which is how you're saying this process should work.",86,,
817,0.97,4261.89,4265.261,"But I think, considering how we're talking about it.",86,,
818,0.97,4265.261,4270.099,It seems sort of exceptional in some respects.,86,,
819,0.97,4270.099,4273.802,"And kind of how things historically have gone, at least.",86,,
820,0.97,4273.802,4279.308,But would that kind of be resolving things in slide 4?,86,,
821,0.97,4279.308,4289.451,And then we never even get to 5? or on step 4. and then we never get to 5 and 6? would that be a way to think about it?,86,,
822,0.97,4289.451,4292.955,I think mark references in his previous conversation.,87,,
823,0.97,4292.955,4295.691,The idea is to provide resources.,87,,
824,0.97,4295.691,4305.267,"And to certainly team up with Rha, ahead of a potential removal, to ensure that resources are deployed.",87,,
825,0.97,4305.267,4311.874,And could be as soon as the site is Prioritized and doesn't have to be at the time of posting.,87,,
826,0.97,4311.874,4315.177,And I think the other Councilmember was asking that question.,87,,
827,0.97,4315.177,4316.011,It could be opportunity here.,87,,
828,0.97,4316.011,4322.484,There are times when the sites are escalated in terms of priority.,87,,
829,0.97,4322.484,4325.754,And that could Off-Track the time line.,87,,
830,0.97,4325.754,4326.088,And Ideally.,87,,
831,0.97,4326.088,4335.698,"When we have the able to do so, we are starting the outreach Proactively, to ensure that we are establishing relationships and assisting individuals at that Enampment.",87,,
832,0.97,4335.698,4335.998,Right.,88,,
833,0.97,4335.998,4340.035,But I guess what I'm asking is with Ballard Commons.,88,,
834,0.97,4340.035,4344.54,I think the way that we structured that is we were able to solve for everybody first.,88,,
835,0.97,4344.54,4345.874,Then we did a posting.,88,,
836,0.97,4345.874,4348.544,But the posting was to remove debris at that point.,88,,
837,0.97,4348.544,4353.182,Because the people had all kind of left the site.,88,,
838,0.97,4353.182,4364.226,"And I'm just wondering in this arrangement of steps, like I sort of see that as like our work kind of finishes a step 4.",88,,
839,0.97,4364.226,4373.535,"The removal posting doesn't really kind of matter at that point, because it doesn't involve the displacement of any potential people who have been at the site anymore.",88,,
840,0.97,4373.535,4378.24,And I guess I'm just asking a clarifying question.,88,,
841,0.97,4378.24,4388.283,Like would we consider Ballard Commons and bitter Lake to have resolved in this numbered process at 4 and not really moved beyond that?,88,,
842,0.97,4388.283,4396.825,Or are you arguing or stating that Ballard Commons is out of this process entirely because it was sort of addressed differently?,88,,
843,0.97,4396.825,4400.329,I'm just trying to get a clarification.,88,,
844,0.97,4400.329,4400.596,Right.,89,,
845,0.97,4400.596,4402.364,And I appreciate the clarification there.,89,,
846,0.97,4402.364,4403.999,Our goal is always to get folks inside.,89,,
847,0.97,4403.999,4408.37,And there may be a few individuals left on site.,89,,
848,0.97,4408.37,4410.172,And that may happen at the time of the posting.,89,,
849,0.97,4410.172,4415.043,But we want to be able to offer shelter up to the actual day of removal.,89,,
850,0.97,4415.043,4418.747,There are cases where that work is Proactive.,89,,
851,0.97,4418.747,4424.92,And there's less of a need to provide offers or Transportations or connections at the time of the removal.,89,,
852,0.97,4424.92,4427.156,But it depends on the case.,89,,
853,0.97,4427.156,4429.925,And I hope that I'm answering your question there.,89,,
854,0.97,4429.925,4430.359,Yeah.,90,,
855,0.97,4430.359,4442.604,"I think I have some other questions, but I'll save them to the end of the presentation.",90,,
856,0.97,4442.604,4450.245,"Chair Mosqueda, do you have a question about this slide some or is it something that we should Bookmark until the end of the presentation?",90,,
857,0.97,4450.245,4453.448,I'll hold.,91,,
858,0.97,4453.448,4453.715,Okay.,92,,
859,0.97,4453.715,4455.184,Great.,92,,
860,0.97,4455.184,4455.484,Thank you.,92,,
861,0.97,4455.484,4457.453,"Mr. Bailey, you can continue.",92,,
862,0.97,4457.453,4462.825,Certainly.,93,,
863,0.97,4462.825,4463.158,All right.,93,,
864,0.97,4463.158,4465.194,So as it relates to calendar year 2021.,93,,
865,0.97,4465.194,4472.034,I wanted to highlight some of the information that was provided in our last outcomes report.,93,,
866,0.97,4472.034,4476.805,The hope team conducted 1203 shelter referrals.,93,,
867,0.97,4476.805,4482.01,This represents about 30% increase from the 2020 year-end total.,93,,
868,0.97,4482.01,4491.253,"In 2021, the hope team facilitated referrals from approximately 32 different outreach providers and service organizations.",93,,
869,0.97,4491.253,4492.988,And from 119 encampment locations.,93,,
870,0.97,4492.988,4513.475,"793 of those referrals were Bipoc, and while I'm here, I would like to share that the hope team's referral process Prioritizes people with the highest Vulnerabilities, from active High-Priority sites and individuals Witmultiple vulnerability, regardless of encampment, race or ability.",93,,
871,0.97,4513.475,4520.382,"We do capture this, but that is to ensure that equity is not an Afterthought.",93,,
872,0.97,4520.382,4522.885,Just to make a clarifying statement there.,93,,
873,0.97,4522.885,4527.055,92% were to enhance shelters and this includes tiny House villages.,93,,
874,0.97,4527.055,4530.259,I believe we ended 2020 with 80% or 81%.,93,,
875,0.97,4530.259,4535.631,So there is a slight increase there.,93,,
876,0.97,4535.631,4541.203,"Of that 1203 figure, we had 576 confirmed enrollments.",93,,
877,0.97,4541.203,4547.476,"And while this number improved quite a bit from 2020, our goal is continuous improvement in this area.",93,,
878,0.97,4547.476,4553.682,"As you know, we can't Overrule someone's decision to decline shelter.",93,,
879,0.97,4553.682,4562.858,But we can work with the individual to better understand their unique needs and the factors contributing to that decision.,93,,
880,0.97,4562.858,4568.931,The chart you see here displaced some of the previous information.,94,,
881,0.97,4568.931,4572.901,"But it provides some additional context, really by comparing it to previous years.",94,,
882,0.97,4572.901,4581.376,"As you can see in 2021, the city experienced an increase in referrals, shelter and enrollments.",94,,
883,0.97,4581.376,4598.393,"Our 2021 figures are partly due to the enhanced shelter investments that came Online, and that includes the addition of 200-Plus temporary rooms at Hotel-Based shelters that includes Kings Inn and also hotel, or executive hotel Pacific.",94,,
884,0.97,4598.393,4603.865,"And also 100 plus new tiny homes that came Online, around fall of last year.",94,,
885,0.97,4603.865,4612.341,"In presenting this data, I want to be transparent in the struggles that we faced, the impacts from the Covid-19 event.",94,,
886,0.97,4612.341,4619.481,It challenged staffing capability throughout the year and often resulted in a number of shelters coming off line for weeks at a time.,94,,
887,0.97,4619.481,4624.252,I also want to highlight the enrollment data.,94,,
888,0.97,4624.252,4632.16,"And while the increase is promising, there is a percentage of those that we're unable to account for.",94,,
889,0.97,4632.16,4632.561,The H.I.N.S.,94,,
890,0.97,4632.561,4639.301,Data which is essentially the Federal homelessness management system.,94,,
891,0.97,4639.301,4647.509,"It Automyselfs 25% of the data, which creates complications for us, when we're trying to match that with the data.",94,,
892,0.97,4647.509,4655.183,"That figure could be a little bit higher, but We'Reup we're unable to do that.",94,,
893,0.97,4655.183,4660.989,And that is due to the rules requiring the Opt-In feature.,94,,
894,0.97,4660.989,4669.398,"And I also want to add that over the last year, the hope team has supported efforts for individuals.",94,,
895,0.97,4669.398,4671.533,And that has really reduced barriers.,94,,
896,0.97,4671.533,4687.716,We're doing things such as providing direct transportation to shelter and helping to facilitate the intake process at the shelter.,94,,
897,0.97,4687.716,4688.283,Right.,95,,
898,0.97,4688.283,4696.958,"And so in 2022, this year, we look forward to supporting the Rha, as they take lead, in this regional coordination of outreach efforts.",95,,
899,0.97,4696.958,4702.197,We'll say that efforts are under way to streamline information sharing and data collection.,95,,
900,0.97,4702.197,4706.468,"And that's again, part of that unified care team.",95,,
901,0.97,4706.468,4708.37,But also taking direction from Rha.,95,,
902,0.97,4708.37,4712.174,We really look forward to supporting this innovation.,95,,
903,0.97,4712.174,4719.581,"And also, just identifying opportunity to ensure they continue to operate.",95,,
904,0.97,4719.581,4721.416,Both a Human-Centered approach.,95,,
905,0.97,4721.416,4725.72,And I believe they also talked about the Rha scheme.,95,,
906,0.97,4725.72,4730.325,And also the point around collaborating the necessary information.,95,,
907,0.97,4730.325,4732.094,To better perform the development of that tool.,95,,
908,0.97,4732.094,4734.129,And see where it can be implemented.,95,,
909,0.97,4734.129,4737.232,And I also want to end with just some recognition.,95,,
910,0.97,4737.232,4741.603,"As many of you know, March is social work month.",95,,
911,0.97,4741.603,4746.108,I want to recognize the team members that step up every day to advance this work.,95,,
912,0.97,4746.108,4747.809,"They show their dedication, their skill.",95,,
913,0.97,4747.809,4755.317,"In fact, it was our outreach providers, service providers but also our providers in the county.",95,,
914,0.97,4755.317,4759.087,And most certainly here on the hope team.,95,,
915,0.97,4759.087,4763.058,I want to formally and publicly thank them for their commitment.,95,,
916,0.97,4763.058,4767.696,"And with that being said, that actually concludes our presentation.",95,,
917,0.97,4767.696,4774.102,"Committee chair Lewis, I will hand it back to you, and I'm happy to answer questions you may have.",95,,
918,0.97,4774.102,4775.971,"Thank you, deputy director Bailey.",96,,
919,0.97,4775.971,4777.038,Thank you for that presentation.,96,,
920,0.97,4777.038,4781.209,I know I have several questions and I know several Council colleagues do as well.,96,,
921,0.97,4781.209,4789.351,I wanted to give an opportunity for Jeff Sims from our Council staff to also provide a bit of analysis.,96,,
922,0.97,4789.351,4803.798,"Committee viewers will recognize Jeff for his ongoing role in tracking for the Council, the hope team proceeding navigation teams.",96,,
923,0.97,4803.798,4806.434,The policy surrounding those entities for the Council.,96,,
924,0.97,4806.434,4817.078,"So I wanted to give an opportunity, too, for Jeff to present on a couple of Metrics and things that the Council has been tracking throughout the history of our engagement in this area.",96,,
925,0.97,4817.078,4820.615,Before we open it up to broader questions.,96,,
926,0.97,4820.615,4823.151,"So Jeff, why don't you take it away?",96,,
927,0.97,4823.151,4827.322,Thank you.,97,,
928,0.97,4827.322,4842.604,I will take over screen sharing for me and Michael in just a minute.,98,,
929,0.97,4844.706,4847.275,Okay.,99,,
930,0.97,4847.275,4850.212,"Mr. chair, can you let me know that you can see.",99,,
931,0.97,4850.212,4853.014,And that it's clearing up on my screen?,99,,
932,0.97,4853.014,4853.548,I can see it.,100,,
933,0.97,4853.548,4853.815,Great.,101,,
934,0.97,4853.815,4854.783,Thank you.,101,,
935,0.97,4854.783,4860.455,So I want to first thank deputy director Bailey for being here and presenting to us.,101,,
936,0.97,4860.455,4868.964,"I'll note that a lot of the data that I'm going to share is from H.S.D., including the report that deputy director just presented on.",101,,
937,0.97,4868.964,4874.302,I will add a few more data points because I've been tracking this for about 2 1/2 years.,101,,
938,0.97,4874.302,4888.049,"And also, we'll add some in some other data sources that I think help us to go, in some ways, even beyond what the hope team is doing to get a better picture of what the hope team is doing.",101,,
939,0.97,4888.049,4889.985,But getting better pieces of contact information.,101,,
940,0.97,4889.985,4892.921,All of this was provided to the committee a few weeks ago.,101,,
941,0.97,4892.921,4897.559,"About two weeks ago, I believe, as a Writeup that I provided.",101,,
942,0.97,4897.559,4904.532,Then you also noticed the slides that I'm presenting to you also for the public.,101,,
943,0.97,4904.532,4906.735,You can look to have a majority.,101,,
944,0.97,4906.735,4912.007,"First, I want to go to this first chart.",101,,
945,0.97,4912.007,4918.013,And to everyone to see that there is a section that has blue and orange lines at the top.,101,,
946,0.97,4918.013,4921.683,That's the entire period covered by the navigation team.,101,,
947,0.97,4921.683,4924.886,And you'll see the pink line starts.,101,,
948,0.97,4924.886,4928.757,That break is when the navigation Teamstopped functioning.,101,,
949,0.97,4928.757,4930.759,And when the hope team would begin functioning.,101,,
950,0.97,4930.759,4934.462,There is a little bit of an interruption there.,101,,
951,0.97,4934.462,4938.667,So you'll see we have slightly different data reports.,101,,
952,0.97,4938.667,4943.338,The blue line is dew pointed and Unduplicated context.,101,,
953,0.97,4943.338,4944.839,The Unduplicated is the Orange.,101,,
954,0.97,4944.839,4948.043,That the navigation team is reporting.,101,,
955,0.97,4948.043,4949.177,"At that point, a system navigator.",101,,
956,0.97,4949.177,4952.08,They were really being held to a high data standard.,101,,
957,0.97,4952.08,4954.416,Any time they talked to someone to record the conversation.,101,,
958,0.97,4954.416,4963.792,"And what is being recorded as an alternate recommendation, which is what the hope team asks.",101,,
959,0.97,4963.792,4967.295,It's when there are more engagements.,101,,
960,0.97,4967.295,4969.331,And an individual has expressed interest in shelter.,101,,
961,0.97,4969.331,4972.634,Has identified a good match for beds that are available at the time.,101,,
962,0.97,4972.634,4978.073,There is a lot more work that goes beyond what you see on the screen as the pink line.,101,,
963,0.97,4978.073,4981.309,And I'll get to that in a moment.,101,,
964,0.97,4981.309,4983.778,That's the initial orientation that you see.,101,,
965,0.97,4983.778,4985.947,Context has been replaced by recommendations.,101,,
966,0.97,4985.947,4990.318,You will see that the purple and green lines have continued for quite sometime.,101,,
967,0.97,4990.318,4995.79,The purple lines are the number of referrals that the navigation or hope team made to the shelter event.,101,,
968,0.97,4995.79,5010.638,"And the green line is the number of individuals that actually arrived within 48 hours at the location that they were specifically referred to, the deputy director already noted that this is, that green line is not perfect.",101,,
969,0.97,5010.638,5014.542,There are people that choose not to provide their data.,101,,
970,0.97,5014.542,5017.679,A lot of people might provide.,101,,
971,0.97,5017.679,5021.95,"There's a lot of Nonentry, or choosing to opt out of showing up.",101,,
972,0.97,5021.95,5029.924,"There's also other issues that could arise there, that we could go into more if the committee has questions.",101,,
973,0.97,5029.924,5034.529,There's four main things then.,101,,
974,0.97,5034.529,5035.13,The Demo covers.,101,,
975,0.97,5035.13,5040.268,"First, it's noticeable that the pink line there is about four times as high as the pink one.",101,,
976,0.97,5040.268,5046.107,About four people are being recommended for the shelter beds that were reported as available.,101,,
977,0.97,5046.107,5049.277,Compared to the number of people that actually got to go to them.,101,,
978,0.97,5049.277,5057.452,"So put another way, there is about four times as much demand, just through this process, as there is for the actual number of beds that we have.",101,,
979,0.97,5057.452,5063.224,I think that will be important in just a minute.,101,,
980,0.97,5063.224,5070.231,"The deputy director already noted, the green line is about half of the purple line.",101,,
981,0.97,5070.231,5072.901,So about 50% do make it there.,101,,
982,0.97,5072.901,5073.368,That is improvement.,101,,
983,0.97,5073.368,5075.036,It used to be about a quarter.,101,,
984,0.97,5075.036,5077.772,So let's give credit where it's due.,101,,
985,0.97,5077.772,5078.473,That's improved.,101,,
986,0.97,5078.473,5079.107,Hard to know exactly why.,101,,
987,0.97,5079.107,5081.342,It could be the better matching.,101,,
988,0.97,5081.342,5092.787,"It could be that we're offering better shelters as the deputy director night noted that we are making better offers, Noncongregate enhanced shelters.",101,,
989,0.97,5092.787,5096.391,But let's just note that is happening at a higher rate.,101,,
990,0.97,5096.391,5100.962,And the next item I want to know is what is going on with the referral.,101,,
991,0.97,5100.962,5102.831,The purple line.,101,,
992,0.97,5102.831,5105.033,From what we've seen.,101,,
993,0.97,5105.033,5106.935,As director Bailey noted.,101,,
994,0.97,5106.935,5107.836,2021 did do substantially more.,101,,
995,0.97,5107.836,5110.138,We had a lot more referrals made to shelter.,101,,
996,0.97,5110.138,5117.612,But this is where I want to bring in some other data sources and take us a little past just what the hope team is doing.,101,,
997,0.97,5117.612,5120.248,With a look at our shelter bed.,101,,
998,0.97,5120.248,5123.251,I'm going to go back to that slide in a moment.,101,,
999,0.97,5123.251,5129.023,But mainly what I want to point out here is just in the city funded capacity.,101,,
1000,0.97,5129.023,5131.259,You'll see in July 2021.,101,,
1001,0.97,5131.259,5131.96,And September 2021.,101,,
1002,0.97,5131.96,5134.028,Our capacity had notably gone up.,101,,
1003,0.97,5134.028,5143.404,"And even before that, we had had, in July 2020, that number looks Jst slightly higher than the prior six months.",101,,
1004,0.97,5143.404,5145.273,It's actually notably higher.,101,,
1005,0.97,5145.273,5148.042,We opened 120 tiny home village there.,101,,
1006,0.97,5148.042,5153.181,"But because of Covid, we had others that had to cut capacity.",101,,
1007,0.97,5153.181,5156.217,All three of those are plans that the shelter expanded.,101,,
1008,0.97,5156.217,5162.557,"Now, when I go back to that line graph, you'll see vertical red lines.",101,,
1009,0.97,5162.557,5164.526,Showing shelter capacity as a city.,101,,
1010,0.97,5164.526,5170.098,And all of those correlate to a time when the hope team was able to refer more to a shelter.,101,,
1011,0.97,5170.098,5172.667,"And I think Obviously, this isn't perfect research.",101,,
1012,0.97,5172.667,5176.237,I can't guarantee that that is a correlation.,101,,
1013,0.97,5176.237,5180.575,"But it affirms what--frankly, what our system navigators tell us.",101,,
1014,0.97,5180.575,5187.515,"But what is a common understanding that when we make a quality referral, to something that matches people's needs.",101,,
1015,0.97,5187.515,5188.149,It gets taken.,101,,
1016,0.97,5188.149,5189.651,And it's sought after.,101,,
1017,0.97,5189.651,5197.425,"And I think that that's a story we should highlight, underlining the data that deputy director Bailey underlined.",101,,
1018,0.97,5197.425,5203.331,"That as we increase that, that plays into our success in connecting people to shelter.",101,,
1019,0.97,5203.331,5214.876,"This is the primary thing I wanted to highlight, related to referrals and the improvement that the hope that you had over week 1, compared to its predecessor.",101,,
1020,0.97,5214.876,5221.583,"It will be intriguing to see the variations, correlate when we have that that was new.",101,,
1021,0.97,5221.583,5225.353,The last item that the Councilmembers received material on.,101,,
1022,0.97,5225.353,5234.929,"This is the subject of H.S.D .'s written submission, but not as much today, was making referrals to people who identify as black indigenous, or other people of color.",101,,
1023,0.97,5234.929,5244.572,"And as you can see throughout 2021, under the hope team, the results were substantial, much better than had been previously.",101,,
1024,0.97,5244.572,5247.008,And that did tail off towards the end of the year.,101,,
1025,0.97,5247.008,5252.714,"So this is an area, where perhaps deputy director Bailey and his team can provide insight.",101,,
1026,0.97,5252.714,5262.991,But I think it will be worth observing this to see if the progress that was initially made can be sustained and restored.,101,,
1027,0.97,5262.991,5264.259,That encompasses the development received from me.,101,,
1028,0.97,5264.259,5266.761,"So I'll turn it back over to you, Mr. chair.",101,,
1029,0.97,5266.761,5268.196,"Jeff, thank you so much.",102,,
1030,0.97,5268.196,5270.098,For providing that overview.,102,,
1031,0.97,5270.098,5275.87,And I appreciate that we have you on central staff to kind of track these Metrics over the years.,102,,
1032,0.97,5275.87,5279.974,And through several periods of reform and reconstitution of how we do this work.,102,,
1033,0.97,5279.974,5284.078,"It's very helpful to see it, the history all laid out there.",102,,
1034,0.97,5284.078,5289.651,So I have some questions that I think are going to overlap with my colleagues.,102,,
1035,0.97,5289.651,5295.723,"So I think, you know, Councilmember Mosqueda.",102,,
1036,0.97,5295.723,5298.259,Since Councilmember Mosqueda got in line earlier here.,102,,
1037,0.97,5298.259,5301.362,I'll hand it over to her.,102,,
1038,0.97,5301.362,5304.265,And I see Councilmember Herbold has her around up.,102,,
1039,0.97,5304.265,5310.805,So I'll clean up things that are still on the table here at the end.,102,,
1040,0.97,5310.805,5312.74,"Councilmember Herbold, I'm sorry, Mosqueda, please go ahead.",102,,
1041,0.97,5312.74,5313.541,Thanks so much.,103,,
1042,0.97,5313.541,5319.547,"And deputy Bailey, thanks for your presentation and please do extend our appreciation to the folks at H.S.D.",103,,
1043,0.97,5319.547,5327.922,"Again, I know that the team there has been working under a tremendous amount of stress, with high turnover in that area.",103,,
1044,0.97,5327.922,5337.699,"In large part because of uncertainty that was not clarified, given the transition that happened at the end of last year at the R.H.A.",103,,
1045,0.97,5337.699,5340.968,So I know you all have been doing a lot.,103,,
1046,0.97,5340.968,5347.775,"And there's also stressors, individuals in their own life, during these times, so we appreciate the role that they've had.",103,,
1047,0.97,5347.775,5353.247,"I think my questions are, and perhaps, Jeff, if you have additional background, you can provide it.",103,,
1048,0.97,5353.247,5359.387,"I just don't want director Bailey, for you to feel that these are directed at you, or criticism of you and the team.",103,,
1049,0.97,5359.387,5364.459,It's really a picture of the longer picture that I'm aiming to look at here.,103,,
1050,0.97,5364.459,5372.533,"So Jeff, you mentioned that there is four people referred for every one bed available, only through this hope team alone.",103,,
1051,0.97,5372.533,5383.845,"And I know that's something you and I have worked on over the years, is to try to get a better sense of the total amount of people referred per bed, or the number of average beds available on a given night in a month.",103,,
1052,0.97,5383.845,5390.385,"And in terms of asking for data, we had asked for that data repeatedly in 2018 and 2019.",103,,
1053,0.97,5390.385,5395.89,"I think it's maybe a question for R.H.A., if not for H.S.D.",103,,
1054,0.97,5395.89,5397.759,Do we have any additional information?,103,,
1055,0.97,5397.759,5406.701,"I believe you made this request over a month ago, to have information about the total number of beds available on an average night each month.",103,,
1056,0.97,5406.701,5408.87,Any update on that?,103,,
1057,0.97,5408.87,5412.54,I don't have an update on that.,104,,
1058,0.97,5412.54,5420.548,"I did ask a while ago from Kcrha, for the total number or average number of vacancies that occur in shelter.",104,,
1059,0.97,5420.548,5430.892,"We could probably guess, if you just took the quarter, and assumed that all of those are shelter vacancies, that's around maybe 60 per month total.",104,,
1060,0.97,5430.892,5432.827,That's from the beds reserved as well as all others.,104,,
1061,0.97,5432.827,5438.132,"But really, that's the place the Kcrha should confirm.",104,,
1062,0.97,5438.132,5443.838,"Mark just a couple of moments ago, indicated 12 to 18 per month.",104,,
1063,0.97,5443.838,5445.907,I think sorting that out would be useful.,104,,
1064,0.97,5445.907,5451.546,"At one point, it was three or four beds available on an average night in 2019, I think.",105,,
1065,0.97,5451.546,5454.615,So it would be helpful to see if that number has changed.,105,,
1066,0.97,5454.615,5463.424,And then I'm also interested in knowing perhaps this is another question for Kcrha.,105,,
1067,0.97,5463.424,5474.936,What would that number have been if we opened the tiny House villages and Thelots that the city council had authorized in last year's budget.,105,,
1068,0.97,5474.936,5479.273,So if that would have opened if those number of spaces for beds had opened.,105,,
1069,0.97,5479.273,5486.781,And I guess I will follow up as well with Rha to see if they have that information.,105,,
1070,0.97,5486.781,5490.751,Seems like the more appropriate place.,105,,
1071,0.97,5490.751,5491.118,Probably so.,106,,
1072,0.97,5491.118,5493.521,I don't want to mislead you with one statement I made.,106,,
1073,0.97,5493.521,5501.128,"The pink line I just showed a moment ago, showing the total number of shelter recommendations.",106,,
1074,0.97,5501.128,5507.702,That's where for each quarter lately has been four times as high as the number of people that are actually sent to a shelter.,106,,
1075,0.97,5507.702,5513.207,So I don't know if it would be fair to paint that on a nightly basis.,106,,
1076,0.97,5513.207,5514.008,There's--I imagine not.,106,,
1077,0.97,5514.008,5525.72,"I imagine there's some days we have 12 beds open, and only 12 referrals and are the days you have no beds open and 20 referrals.",106,,
1078,0.97,5525.72,5526.787,I'm sure it varies.,106,,
1079,0.97,5526.787,5535.563,"Deputy Bailey, if you want to provide your expertise on that.",106,,
1080,0.97,5535.563,5539.533,But definitely.,106,,
1081,0.97,5539.533,5540.101,"Yeah, Jeff.",107,,
1082,0.97,5540.101,5548.042,I'd love to Clactd with you and getting the information from Rha.,107,,
1083,0.97,5548.042,5550.344,"And typically, it's one referral for one vacancy.",107,,
1084,0.97,5550.344,5553.981,There may be three or Fourrecommendations.,107,,
1085,0.97,5553.981,5555.65,But there's only referral that's made.,107,,
1086,0.97,5555.65,5557.451,"Here again, that's data Crunching in the background.",107,,
1087,0.97,5557.451,5563.758,I'd like to work with you to get a more sufficient and clear answer back to the committee.,107,,
1088,0.97,5563.758,5564.025,Great.,108,,
1089,0.97,5564.025,5567.295,Thanks.,108,,
1090,0.97,5567.295,5574.869,"And Mr. chair, I think--I am just still struggling with trying to understand sort of why we have two separate systems still.",108,,
1091,0.97,5574.869,5585.012,"It's not something I can totally understand just hearing the Back-To-Back presentations about where the coordination is, versus where we could have integration.",108,,
1092,0.97,5585.012,5587.515,And I don't have an answer to that.,108,,
1093,0.97,5587.515,5595.489,"But it's still something that is top of mind to me, as we think about the way to create efficiencies and ensure coordination of services.",108,,
1094,0.97,5595.489,5601.162,"I don't know if you, director, have any comments about that, but it's something that I am still struggling with.",108,,
1095,0.97,5601.162,5602.964,Certainly.,109,,
1096,0.97,5602.964,5603.364,And here again.,109,,
1097,0.97,5603.364,5608.669,This is an answer that we can probably work with Rha just to better clarify.,109,,
1098,0.97,5608.669,5611.472,It's one thing for me to say something.,109,,
1099,0.97,5611.472,5616.377,But I think it's more powerful for us to come in.,109,,
1100,0.97,5616.377,5622.683,But just Referencing the city's previous comment liability.,109,,
1101,0.97,5622.683,5629.89,"In the event that Rha declines to assist, the city is still liable for providing that type of outreach.",109,,
1102,0.97,5629.89,5631.192,That's what the hope team does.,109,,
1103,0.97,5631.192,5637.098,But I believe there is opportunity for improved coordination and improved collaboration.,109,,
1104,0.97,5637.098,5638.399,Just that we're working together.,109,,
1105,0.97,5638.399,5639.1,Rha has a regional approach.,109,,
1106,0.97,5639.1,5646.574,I like to think of the unified care team and the hope team as that local extension.,109,,
1107,0.97,5646.574,5648.976,So there is that opportunity to Clabts.,109,,
1108,0.97,5648.976,5654.448,"Here again, we'll come back and view this in with a more appropriate answer.",109,,
1109,0.97,5654.448,5655.016,Councilmember Herbold.,110,,
1110,0.97,5655.016,5656.45,Thanks so much.,111,,
1111,0.97,5656.45,5658.886,"Deputy director Bailey, thank you for being with us.",111,,
1112,0.97,5658.886,5665.326,Sorry that this is such a thorny project for your first presentation.,111,,
1113,0.97,5665.326,5669.897,"But really appreciate this presentation, and really appreciate your clear answers.",111,,
1114,0.97,5669.897,5690.551,"Really, I think what this Council wants most, you'll find, is clearer answers, that we can--even when the responses are unsatisfactory, we can at least share what we've learned with members of the public, so we have sort of a level setting of expectations.",111,,
1115,0.97,5690.551,5697.091,"That's, I think, what we hope to receive in these engagements.",111,,
1116,0.97,5697.091,5701.195,And appreciate how you stepped in that direction right off the bat.,111,,
1117,0.97,5701.195,5706.233,Couple of questions I do have.,111,,
1118,0.97,5706.233,5719.38,"So director Doans in their presentation earlier, made reference to some separate sort of buckets of Set-Asides.",111,,
1119,0.97,5719.38,5739.166,"And so I just really would like to understand a little bit more about those Set-Asides and on slide 5, the bullet Referenced manually tracking bed availability across all Set- aside shelters to ensure shelter is available for those at a posted site.",111,,
1120,0.97,5739.166,5740.868,So just want to understand.,111,,
1121,0.97,5740.868,5745.539,What is the number of set aside beds?,111,,
1122,0.97,5745.539,5750.01,What percentage of all City- supported shelter beds are Set- asides?,111,,
1123,0.97,5750.01,5757.017,And is the hope team the only entity that can refer people to the Set-Asides?,111,,
1124,0.97,5757.017,5763.657,And how many Set-Aside beds are available for referral on an average day?,111,,
1125,0.97,5763.657,5764.258,That's one set of questions.,111,,
1126,0.97,5764.258,5776.403,And then my other questions relate to--my other question relates to the way the city handles obstruction Removals versus Nonobstruction Removals.,111,,
1127,0.97,5776.403,5789.55,"And I think most of us know, according to the Mdars obstruction Removals as the policy is written on paper.",111,,
1128,0.97,5789.55,5793.754,They do not require 72 hours advanced posting.,111,,
1129,0.97,5793.754,5795.389,Do not require shelters to individuals.,111,,
1130,0.97,5795.389,5816.043,"And I think for all the reasons that we've talked about in this presentation, and in the conversations that we've had with Rha, taking that kind of a--a expeditious approach, can actually create harm.",111,,
1131,0.97,5816.043,5820.881,"I really appreciate the need to have Passible sidewalks, for instance.",111,,
1132,0.97,5820.881,5832.259,"Have it possible for people to get into the door, in the doors of their businesses and residence.",111,,
1133,0.97,5832.259,5850.711,"And also balancing the needs of access to public right of way, with the harm that could be done from really following the Mdars to the litter and just want to know, understand, what is the city's approach going to be, moving forward?",111,,
1134,0.97,5850.711,5857.685,"We saw, of course, the encampment removal here across the street from City Hall.",111,,
1135,0.97,5857.685,5865.926,"I think it was, from my observation, it seemed like we were starting with an obstruction removal.",111,,
1136,0.97,5865.926,5869.53,And treating it as something that didn't need a lot of advanced notice.,111,,
1137,0.97,5869.53,5870.698,And a lot of engagement.,111,,
1138,0.97,5870.698,5877.238,"But then we, I think, had a different perspective, and slowed things down to allow for that engagement.",111,,
1139,0.97,5877.238,5886.38,"But again, I think it's really important to have some clarity of understanding of what the expectations are, moving forward.",111,,
1140,0.97,5886.38,5904.131,"I do want to also flag that the whole concept of obstruction Removals makes the partnership for zero, a very confusing concept to me.",111,,
1141,0.97,5904.131,5909.937,"Because I think most Encampments downtown, probably 80% of them, would qualify as obstructions.",111,,
1142,0.97,5909.937,5916.81,And so what is the partnership for zero accomplishing?,111,,
1143,0.97,5916.81,5935.129,"As far as meeting that functional zero, if all we've done is remove people from downtown, by deeming them obstruction Removals, when there's no requirement or need for engagement to give people other alternatives?",111,,
1144,0.97,5935.129,5936.497,Perfect.,112,,
1145,0.97,5936.497,5937.998,I am tracking your questions.,112,,
1146,0.97,5937.998,5944.705,And I thank you for the opportunity to provide some clarity here.,112,,
1147,0.97,5944.705,5947.841,Total number of hope set asides would be 816.,112,,
1148,0.97,5947.841,5953.747,This is about 30% of the total City-Funded beds.,112,,
1149,0.97,5953.747,5957.651,"The total number of City-Funded beds would be 2,837.",112,,
1150,0.97,5957.651,5960.721,"The average number of beds available, historically has been seven to 10.",112,,
1151,0.97,5960.721,5967.261,I do want to note that that is the Statistic that I asked to take back with Jeff and Rha.,112,,
1152,0.97,5967.261,5971.465,So we will clarify that and provide that back to Committee.,112,,
1153,0.97,5971.465,5973.334,The hope team coordinates referrals.,112,,
1154,0.97,5973.334,5975.069,But we work in partnership.,112,,
1155,0.97,5975.069,5977.438,And we're working with outreach providers.,112,,
1156,0.97,5977.438,5982.109,And that's really to ensure that individuals meet the individual needs remember the purpose behind the beds.,112,,
1157,0.97,5982.109,5987.181,"We need to have an available bed, in order to make a legitimate offer.",112,,
1158,0.97,5987.181,5989.016,We don't want to lead people astray.,112,,
1159,0.97,5989.016,5991.185,And that relationship building is so critical.,112,,
1160,0.97,5991.185,6000.894,"So our folks are often calling the shelters in Realtime, just to say, Hey, do you have this availability?",112,,
1161,0.97,6000.894,6005.599,"Typically through our chat box feature, we are getting that Dat Atypically, the morning of.",112,,
1162,0.97,6005.599,6007.434,But things may change throughout the day.,112,,
1163,0.97,6007.434,6013.006,So we want to make shower we're making referrals and recommendations in Realtime to spaces that are actually available.,112,,
1164,0.97,6013.006,6018.445,"As it relates to the partnership for zero, I would defer to our partners at Rha.",112,,
1165,0.97,6018.445,6019.279,It is their project.,112,,
1166,0.97,6019.279,6021.248,We are very much supportive of that.,112,,
1167,0.97,6021.248,6023.183,We're excited to support them in that work.,112,,
1168,0.97,6023.183,6030.19,"But I feel as if Rha, and/or mark, would be better suited to answer that question.",112,,
1169,0.97,6030.19,6030.657,So --,113,,
1170,0.97,6030.657,6032.259,So it wasn't a question.,114,,
1171,0.97,6032.259,6036.497,I didn't have a question about anything Rha was doing.,114,,
1172,0.97,6036.497,6038.966,It was sort of reflection.,114,,
1173,0.97,6038.966,6039.333,Got you.,115,,
1174,0.97,6039.333,6043.103,My question was more about how the city is handling Removals.,116,,
1175,0.97,6043.103,6061.455,"And if my reflection was, if the city is truly handing obstruction Removals the way the Mdars say you can, which I hope you are not, which is there is Norequirement for advanced notice or engagement.",116,,
1176,0.97,6061.455,6068.595,"And 80% of the Encampments Downtowner obstruction Encampments, doesn't leave a whole lot for partnership zero to do.",116,,
1177,0.97,6068.595,6075.836,Because we're not--most of the locations are not locations where we're engaging and trying to find people housing for.,116,,
1178,0.97,6075.836,6084.411,Unless what you tell me is that we are not handling obstruction Encampments in the way the Mdars say we are.,116,,
1179,0.97,6084.411,6094.822,"That we are not doing Removals without obstruction locations, without notice, and without engagement.",116,,
1180,0.97,6094.822,6095.989,"Again, the Mdars allow that.",116,,
1181,0.97,6095.989,6098.125,And my apologies there.,117,,
1182,0.97,6098.125,6103.864,So the Mdars do not require the city to provide offers of shelter at an obstruction.,117,,
1183,0.97,6103.864,6113.674,"However, the hill team has and will continue to provide shelter offers to individuals during these Removals as capacity allows us to do so.",117,,
1184,0.97,6113.674,6118.412,So the three system navigators are really structured to support the Mdar requirements.,117,,
1185,0.97,6118.412,6125.586,But we are trying to provide those offers as capacity allows.,117,,
1186,0.97,6125.586,6130.591,"So obstruction Removals will occur without notice, and without engagement.",118,,
1187,0.97,6130.591,6135.262,"In those cases, where there's no capacity?",118,,
1188,0.97,6135.262,6135.996,Is that what I'm hearing?,118,,
1189,0.97,6135.996,6139.199,Can you repeat the question one more time?,119,,
1190,0.97,6139.199,6139.933,Just so I clearly have it?,119,,
1191,0.97,6139.933,6141.668,What I thought I heard.,120,,
1192,0.97,6141.668,6143.07,And I may have heard wrong.,120,,
1193,0.97,6143.07,6157.451,"But what I thought I heard is, obstruction Removals, which according to the Mdars, you don't have to do advancement and don't have to do engagement.",120,,
1194,0.97,6157.451,6165.292,"Those Removals will continue, without engagement, and without advanced notice, in those instances, points in time, when there's no shelter capacity?",120,,
1195,0.97,6165.292,6170.531,That is a question I would like to take back to the unified care team.,121,,
1196,0.97,6170.531,6175.002,Just so I can provide an accurate response on the direction ahead.,121,,
1197,0.97,6175.002,6175.435,Appreciate that.,122,,
1198,0.97,6175.435,6180.04,Thank you so much.,122,,
1199,0.97,6180.04,6180.307,Okay.,123,,
1200,0.97,6180.307,6184.678,"So just jumping in, I have a few questions go over here.",123,,
1201,0.97,6184.678,6188.215,That I think are kind of generally related.,123,,
1202,0.97,6188.215,6189.516,"Because I, you know.",123,,
1203,0.97,6189.516,6192.519,"I mean, cutting through the crux of the general issue.",123,,
1204,0.97,6192.519,6224.818,"I think it would just be good to have some level setting going forward of just having the same V interest, and hopefully can center the work of what needs to be done with our shared interest, as acting city government workers who care deeply about outreach, sheltering and outreach for people experiencing homelessness in Seattle.",123,,
1205,0.97,6224.818,6229.59,And I think that's been the Subtext from some of the questions from some of my colleagues.,123,,
1206,0.97,6229.59,6243.77,"That when we look at this data, I think where we get bogged down is all of us can agree that we haven't have obstructed public infrastructure in the city of Seattle.",123,,
1207,0.97,6243.77,6246.64,We want to be Compliant with the Ada.,123,,
1208,0.97,6246.64,6255.682,We want to make sure everyone can walk and roll through the city in a way that is safe and not obstructed by Human-Created structures.,123,,
1209,0.97,6255.682,6263.49,"We also all agree that people should not be living with nothing but like the thin layer of a tent, between them and the elements.",123,,
1210,0.97,6263.49,6266.059,That that's not a humane way for people to live.,123,,
1211,0.97,6266.059,6277.504,"That we should aspire in a city that is as wealthy as we are, to provide some level of shelter, even intermediate shelter to folks.",123,,
1212,0.97,6277.504,6277.838,Barring that.,123,,
1213,0.97,6277.838,6299.126,"We should also be at the very least, pragmatic and Clear-Eyed, that if people do move from a place, we need to have some kind of plan or strategy, for people that are moved in the event that there is an Exigent removal and we don't have a place for people to go inside.",123,,
1214,0.97,6299.126,6306.667,I think we need to have a conversation about the impact of displacement.,123,,
1215,0.97,6306.667,6313.34,"And I think Anec Dottlely, and--Anecdotally.",123,,
1216,0.97,6313.34,6325.185,"That goes around in the media extensively, like the fourth Avenue action that happened recently.",123,,
1217,0.97,6325.185,6346.106,"And they then see, shortly thereafter, new concentrations of tents Ajacent to their building or in front of their building, in the same neighborhood there's immediately a connection from the Stakeholders that it's sort of their turn to be in the position to have an encampment from front of their building.",123,,
1218,0.97,6346.106,6349.443,And that that's not fair to them.,123,,
1219,0.97,6349.443,6357.217,"And it's certainly not tear fair to the people living in the tents, who are moving around, without some kind of accommodation for the displacement.",123,,
1220,0.97,6357.217,6364.091,"So I guess one question I would ask in the operations of how we're doing this, and how we are doing the navigation.",123,,
1221,0.97,6364.091,6381.675,"When it becomes fairly evident, there is going to be a certain amount of displacement of people who are living in an encampment, and those folks will not that Evenlying be going to a shelter.",123,,
1222,0.97,6381.675,6385.612,Because there not enough space to move them to.,123,,
1223,0.97,6385.612,6403.463,"What are the significant impacts in terms of displacement, in terms of where those folks are going to go, where those folks are going to camp next, and how are we not, you know, losing touch and building mistrust, with that population of folks who are displaced?",123,,
1224,0.97,6403.463,6414.408,I guess that would be my first question.,123,,
1225,0.97,6414.408,6414.941,Councilmember.,124,,
1226,0.97,6414.941,6416.243,Thank you for the question.,124,,
1227,0.97,6416.243,6421.114,"And when a site is Prioritized by the city, for removal.",124,,
1228,0.97,6421.114,6426.019,"Our hope team is providing assistance, up to and on the day of the removal.",124,,
1229,0.97,6426.019,6428.722,That assistance is a genuine offer of shelter.,124,,
1230,0.97,6428.722,6437.097,"Here again, we can't force someone to accept the offer, but we're doing everything in our power to build relationships up until that point.",124,,
1231,0.97,6437.097,6439.8,So that we have a better chance of getting them to say yes.,124,,
1232,0.97,6439.8,6446.406,"And that could be getting a better Understnding of their needs and Aligning their preference, with space that is available.",124,,
1233,0.97,6446.406,6457.617,"So to the best of our ability, we are trying to ensure that individuals at an encampment that have option prior to that encampment removal taking place.",124,,
1234,0.97,6457.617,6466.393,"I will say that as we move forward and as the Rha provides this regional strategy, we are excited to support that work.",124,,
1235,0.97,6466.393,6472.899,"And halls that Prioritizations will, which may allow us to be even more Proactive in that outreach.",124,,
1236,0.97,6472.899,6475.502,Did I answer your question?,124,,
1237,0.97,6475.502,6477.704,"I mean, some of it.",125,,
1238,0.97,6477.704,6478.071,Okay.,126,,
1239,0.97,6478.071,6482.843,"Maybe just to be more clear, right?",127,,
1240,0.97,6482.843,6485.212,What I'm really just talking about.,127,,
1241,0.97,6485.212,6493.687,"And I think what Frustrates a lot of community Stakeholders across the spectrum, Frustrates people who are advocate for folks who are Unhoused.",127,,
1242,0.97,6493.687,6500.56,"Because they see a certain level of--well, I mean, there's certainly a lot of disruption to somebody.",127,,
1243,0.97,6500.56,6506.366,If they're getting displaced from camping in one place to camp somewhere else.,127,,
1244,0.97,6506.366,6518.311,"There's also frustration from, you know, businesses and neighborhoods that you know, will--where an encampment will kind of come in to that neighborhood and set up.",127,,
1245,0.97,6518.311,6520.113,Because it was displaced from somewhere else.,127,,
1246,0.97,6520.113,6533.059,"And I guess what I'm just getting at is, to what extent are we planning to mitigate the impact of displacement, both for the people who are being displaced from the encampment.",127,,
1247,0.97,6533.059,6536.529,Like I would just like us to kind of acknowledge that this happens.,127,,
1248,0.97,6536.529,6540.767,I guess it's also part of what I'm saying.,127,,
1249,0.97,6540.767,6546.273,I'd just like us to Pragmatically acknowledge that not everyone goes to shelter when we do these Removals.,127,,
1250,0.97,6546.273,6551.044,"Despite our best efforts and best intentions, we know no one wants Todisplace anybody.",127,,
1251,0.97,6551.044,6554.047,"But the reality is, people do get displaced.",127,,
1252,0.97,6554.047,6561.922,"So my question is, to what extent into we spend time planning and thinking about mitigating the impact of that?",127,,
1253,0.97,6561.922,6566.326,"Because my concern is that I don't know that historically, we spent a lot of time doing that.",127,,
1254,0.97,6566.326,6580.473,"It's something I would like to work with the Department on, at least in the meantime, between, you know, when we all the magical scale Psh on a hill someday, where we have a lot of it.",127,,
1255,0.97,6580.473,6590.417,"We're going to be--and I just feel like historically, we've sort of tacitly, kind of denied that it happens.",127,,
1256,0.97,6590.417,6596.122,Or we haven't acknowledged it.,127,,
1257,0.97,6596.122,6599.726,And it irritates my constituents across the spectrum.,127,,
1258,0.97,6599.726,6607.467,I get these complaints from people who are Progressive or conservative that for a variety of reasons Express frustration with that impact.,127,,
1259,0.97,6607.467,6615.175,"And I was just wondering like how we might work together to address it, what some of the some of the current strategies are to address it.",127,,
1260,0.97,6615.175,6622.716,Because it does seem like a loophole in what we're doing.,127,,
1261,0.97,6622.716,6625.018,"That, you know, I don't have great answers to now.",127,,
1262,0.97,6625.018,6629.289,And kind of want to hear from the Department on thoughts.,127,,
1263,0.97,6629.289,6629.656,Certainly.,128,,
1264,0.97,6629.656,6637.464,So a lot of this work is taking place with the unified care team.,128,,
1265,0.97,6637.464,6639.366,And we ever looking at Problemsholically.,128,,
1266,0.97,6639.366,6641.201,I do want to acknowledge what you shared.,128,,
1267,0.97,6641.201,6644.237,"The desire is not to shift, where these individuals are going.",128,,
1268,0.97,6644.237,6647.674,But the intent is to house these individuals and to provide them with shelter.,128,,
1269,0.97,6647.674,6650.31,And I recognize that that is not always the case.,128,,
1270,0.97,6650.31,6655.548,We are working as a unified team across the city to identify strategies for this.,128,,
1271,0.97,6655.548,6662.722,But this is also an opportunity for Rha to take the lead and provide guidance for what they see as best.,128,,
1272,0.97,6662.722,6666.092,And for us to support our counties and the regional partners for this work.,128,,
1273,0.97,6666.092,6675.802,"I think the opportunity to have pure navigators, outreach and case management, actually follow these individuals, increases the likelihood, that they'll actually receive shelter.",128,,
1274,0.97,6675.802,6679.406,But in the event that they decline.,128,,
1275,0.97,6679.406,6680.373,Those relationships have been established.,128,,
1276,0.97,6680.373,6687.814,So it's an opportunity for those individuals to Reengage and then try again to try to help House these other individuals.,128,,
1277,0.97,6687.814,6691.418,So I'm unable to speak to an Overranching strategy today.,128,,
1278,0.97,6691.418,6708.301,"But I believe as we move forward, both with our partnership with Rha, but also with our unified work care team that we will have comprehensive strategy that we can bring back to the team.",128,,
1279,0.97,6708.301,6710.77,Can we identify.,129,,
1280,0.97,6710.77,6714.974,And I see Counselim member Morales has her hand up.,129,,
1281,0.97,6714.974,6721.347,And I'll Pivot to her in a moment.,129,,
1282,0.97,6721.347,6731.791,"But do we do these postings, the number of people who are displaced without any kind of mitigation or exit strategy from the encampment?",129,,
1283,0.97,6731.791,6736.996,"That honestly might be somewhere at least to start, to sort of monitor and acknowledge.",129,,
1284,0.97,6736.996,6737.33,Because look.,129,,
1285,0.97,6737.33,6745.839,"I think at the base of it, you know, I get the underlying premise, that there are certain locations where there are Encampments.",129,,
1286,0.97,6745.839,6750.577,"And they can't just stay there, because it is posing an obstruction.",129,,
1287,0.97,6750.577,6755.882,We can debate the extent to which Encampments are an obstruction.,129,,
1288,0.97,6755.882,6760.053,"There's been debate about that, where people have alleged the posting as viewed.",129,,
1289,0.97,6760.053,6767.627,"But I'm saying for the sake of airport, we know of places where there are clear obstructions and needs to be removed.",129,,
1290,0.97,6767.627,6774.467,And a certain amount of displacement might have to be accommodated because of the risk that that obstruction chose.,129,,
1291,0.97,6774.467,6785.044,What I would like us to at least do is monitor and track the amount of that displacement as a metric that we are working to minimize and eventually eliminate.,129,,
1292,0.97,6785.044,6785.678,And at least to know.,129,,
1293,0.97,6785.678,6797.423,"Because I feel like right now, if there is a certain number of people in an encampment Seattle, that we aren't able to solve for, because of our resource deficiencies.",129,,
1294,0.97,6797.423,6802.295,We are not really tracking that information as Deciduously as we could be.,129,,
1295,0.97,6802.295,6807.3,We might be able to define it from some of the other Metrics we have.,129,,
1296,0.97,6807.3,6810.303,Like Maybe the gap between actual referrals and shelter.,129,,
1297,0.97,6810.303,6818.945,"But I would just like us to acknowledge as a metric, that there's a certain level of displacement, and track it and work together to get it down.",129,,
1298,0.97,6818.945,6823.85,And that Pivots to a discussion that is a little outside of the scope of what we're doing here.,129,,
1299,0.97,6823.85,6825.618,With the data.,129,,
1300,0.97,6825.618,6828.822,"But I mean, I guess it's related.",129,,
1301,0.97,6828.822,6833.593,"I mean, as Jeff, you know, Jeff's charts show, right?",129,,
1302,0.97,6833.593,6839.132,Whenever we have more places to send people that are desirable.,129,,
1303,0.97,6839.132,6846.372,We do almost entirely eliminate that impact of the displacement.,129,,
1304,0.97,6846.372,6852.845,If Ballard Commons Park is supposed to be the example of how this is supposed to work.,129,,
1305,0.97,6852.845,6865.859,"We should be coming together to get the thousand new tiny homes by June that Mayor Harold campaigned on building and the 2,000 new ones by December.",129,,
1306,0.97,6865.859,6870.463,"Because we could, then, do Ballard Commons park.",129,,
1307,0.97,6870.463,6877.003,"Constantly, and all the time, to the great satisfaction of all parties involved, I think.",129,,
1308,0.97,6877.003,6878.972,So I do want to flag that.,129,,
1309,0.97,6878.972,6895.822,"But in the meantime, you know, between now and when in the anticipated, you know, launch of a thousand units in June, that the harmed administration indicated, they want to pursue.",129,,
1310,0.97,6895.822,6900.76,"You know, there's going to be displacement, and we need to figure out a strategy for it.",129,,
1311,0.97,6900.76,6904.764,"I just--I don't need an answer to that, I think we have been over it.",129,,
1312,0.97,6904.764,6922.916,"But I just wanted to get those thoughts out for the Department and for Jeff, in terms of how we might work to make sure we have more data sets, frankly like the end of last year, where we did, we had pretty good results for how the hope team was performing, at least relative to history.",129,,
1313,0.97,6922.916,6929.989,And building on that seems to correlate with the availability of desirable shelter space.,129,,
1314,0.97,6929.989,6933.893,So I want to recognize Councilmember Morales for a question.,129,,
1315,0.97,6933.893,6936.763,Thank you.,130,,
1316,0.97,6936.763,6937.463,Mr. chair.,130,,
1317,0.97,6937.463,6942.302,"And Mr. Bailey, I realize this is--I think your first meeting with us.",130,,
1318,0.97,6942.302,6946.239,You're new in this role.,130,,
1319,0.97,6946.239,6953.046,"And so as Councilmember Herbold said, you've--you're in a sticky wicket.",130,,
1320,0.97,6953.046,6957.05,"And it's--well, welcome.",130,,
1321,0.97,6957.05,6961.187,"You know, I appreciate that there is the new regional authority.",130,,
1322,0.97,6961.187,6965.892,I appreciate that things are shifting and hopefully for the better.,130,,
1323,0.97,6965.892,6975.368,"And I also understand that the intent is to house, that there is not a desire to merely shift people from one side of the street to the other.",130,,
1324,0.97,6975.368,6977.503,And yet that is the impact.,130,,
1325,0.97,6977.503,6979.238,And that's what we need to focus on.,130,,
1326,0.97,6979.238,6988.481,"Not the intent of the things that our city workers are doing, but the impact that they are having, which is to displace people.",130,,
1327,0.97,6988.481,6990.883,Because we don't have sufficient resources.,130,,
1328,0.97,6990.883,6993.953,We don't have sufficient shelter beds available.,130,,
1329,0.97,6993.953,7005.031,"So I appreciate what the chair is asking, which is that we actually create and track what that kind of displacement is, how it's happening, what we're doing about it.",130,,
1330,0.97,7005.031,7009.802,Because that's what we're trying to measure is how that number starts to decrease.,130,,
1331,0.97,7009.802,7020.012,"And if we're not paying attention to it, if we are, you know, tacitly ignoring it, we're not going to be able to solve that problem.",130,,
1332,0.97,7020.012,7029.989,"And so I just want to echo what the chair is asking for, so that we know if we're Actuall solving this problem.",130,,
1333,0.97,7029.989,7043.269,"And you know, moving in the direction of the kind of outreach, the kind of relationship building, the lead time as mark Doarns called it, to establish relationships with people.",130,,
1334,0.97,7043.269,7047.874,So that that number does start to decrease is going to be really important.,130,,
1335,0.97,7047.874,7059.852,And I think this is a critical time right now for us to figure out how these teams and entities are going to work together to solve this problem.,130,,
1336,0.97,7059.852,7065.992,But solving the problem requires that we acknowledge this very key piece.,130,,
1337,0.97,7065.992,7089.482,"Because every city Councilmember has heard from their constituents about the displacement that happens, the impact that it has on neighbors, the impact that it has on folks who are displaced, and the frustration with, their clearly not being an answer to that problem.",130,,
1338,0.97,7124.383,7127.32,And Councilmember I want to publically acknowledge this is an issue.,130,,

1346,0.97,7185.811,7193.886,I know that sometimes as a Council we can be--we can have tough questions in this area.,131,,

1360,0.97,7292.485,7308.0,"You are muted, superintendent Williams.",134,,

1366,0.97,7331.857,7345.438,"It looks like you are off mute but when you talk, maybe it is your head set, I don't know.",136,,
1367,0.97,7345.438,7349.141,Going from teams to zoom.,137,,
1368,0.97,7349.141,7352.178,I still can't.,138,,

1370,0.97,7353.946,7372.565,"Is there one on the device, like on your computer?",138,,
1371,0.97,7385.711,7389.315,I can't hear you still.,138,,
1372,0.97,7389.315,7395.888,He's probably pointing at me.,139,,
1373,0.97,7395.888,7400.493,Why don't I try to fill in.,139,,
1374,0.97,7400.493,7401.527,These are large shoes.,139,,

1380,0.97,7424.784,7426.986,We sent over our presentation.,142,,
1381,0.97,7426.986,7430.99,Is that going be loaded or are we to share to it ourselves?,142,,

1385,0.97,7448.24,7451.377,Just one moment.,145,,
1386,0.97,7451.377,7463.989,Councilmembers from the park side you will getting the C team because Donna waters was going to join Christopher and she is out of the office.,146,,
1387,0.97,7463.989,7467.026,Now we have Christopher without his Mic.,146,,
1388,0.97,7467.026,7479.939,"So, forgive me if I'm not quite as well informed as our teammates, but we also have a great partnership with Spu and I appreciate them joining us today.",146,,
1389,0.97,7479.939,7484.71,In fact I think Idris is going kick it off with the next slide.,146,,
1390,0.97,7484.71,7485.744,"Thank you, Michelle.",147,,
1391,0.97,7485.744,7487.379,"Again, Councilmembers, I appreciate you having us here.",147,,
1392,0.97,7487.379,7495.955,I know a lot of you are familiar with the work that Spu's clean city program does.,147,,
1393,0.97,7495.955,7500.125,More recently the initiative has been creating a little confusion.,147,,
1394,0.97,7500.125,7510.469,We thought it was important to come to day and provide a line of background about how clean city's program and Spu originated.,147,,
1395,0.97,7510.469,7519.945,"Roughly about 20 years ago, we seen a need to provide a clean and safe environment to the communities and neighborhoods we serve.",147,,
1396,0.97,7519.945,7527.52,Part of that objective was to take the tonnage tax and reinvest that in communities.,147,,
1397,0.97,7527.52,7539.231,"Now a suite of these programs were designed to provide services related to legal dumping, graffiti, community cleanup, volunteer programs.",147,,
1398,0.97,7539.231,7550.342,"More recently over the past six years, that tonnage tax became a component of the general wide budget.",147,,
1399,0.97,7550.342,7575.768,"Over the past six or seven years you are all quite familiar with the increase in services that Spu now delivers including mediation programs, Sharps collection and our--since 2020, we actually seen a huge increase in illegal dumping, graffiti in public parks.",147,,
1400,0.97,7575.768,7586.145,We seen a lot of litter and we can relate that coupled with the city staff and shortage and the Hales of Covid.,147,,
1401,0.97,7586.145,7587.046,Reducing our volunteer base.,147,,
1402,0.97,7587.046,7594.253,We seen a significant amount of trash and litter that was just accumulating along with graffiti along the city.,147,,
1403,0.97,7594.253,7614.139,"In response in the late 2020, the city temporarily bonded the clean cities initiative and this was to address the trash that was accumulating based on the reduction of services that our other departments were not able to address along with us.",147,,
1404,0.97,7614.139,7626.085,"For today's presentation, we will focus on the services, which relate to a lot of the work that was deferred to parks and S-Dot for Spu.",147,,
1405,0.97,7626.085,7632.491,We increased the amount of Gro cleans.,147,,
1406,0.97,7632.491,7636.362,We provided private property graffiti Abaitment services and Lastly the community Literates.,147,,
1407,0.97,7636.362,7649.541,So now I am going to hopefully--hopefully Christopher's Mic is working.,147,,
1408,0.97,7649.541,7651.577,Can you hear me.,148,,
1409,0.97,7651.577,7651.777,Okay.,148,,
1410,0.97,7651.777,7658.584,Thank you.,148,,
1411,0.97,7658.584,7667.559,"As part of the Seattle rescue plan, the services were funded to end in 2021.",148,,
1412,0.97,7667.559,7677.336,The Mayor proposed Bud yet included eight months of funding to continue the services and the Council adopted budget extended that to the full year.,148,,
1413,0.97,7677.336,7693.452,The services are all one time funding from the Coronavirus relief fund of 2022.,148,,
1414,0.97,7693.452,7694.353,Next slide.,148,,
1415,0.97,7694.353,7702.561,More specifically this slide here summarizes the 2022 budget for the clean cities surge.,148,,
1416,0.97,7702.561,7704.763,The 2022 adopted budget includes --,148,,
1417,0.97,7704.763,7707.132,"Christopher, I think we are one side off.",149,,
1418,0.97,7707.132,7710.769,"Can you move it forward, thanks.",149,,
1419,0.97,7710.769,7711.136,I'm sorry.,150,,
1420,0.97,7711.136,7711.336,Okay.,150,,
1421,0.97,7711.336,7723.315,So this is a break down of that funding.,150,,
1422,0.97,7723.315,7738.13,The 2022 budget includes $3.9 the bulk of the funds are a collaboration of sale of parks and the Department of transportation to stand up for clean teams.,150,,
1423,0.97,7738.13,7751.41,This work is to provide focus cleaning of parks and neighborhood spaces including those in is Tenner city.,150,,
1424,0.97,7751.41,7757.049,We will discuss these teams in more detail in a few minutes.,150,,
1425,0.97,7757.049,7767.626,The total of $8.4 million in 2022 to support this work is roughly $4.2 million.,150,,
1426,0.97,7767.626,7778.137,Then there's roughly just under a million dollars allocated to Spu for Literates.,150,,
1427,0.97,7778.137,7779.938,Next slide.,150,,
1428,0.97,7779.938,7780.639,Surge enhancements.,150,,
1429,0.97,7780.639,7788.847,Most of funding in 2022 supports the work of temporary clean teams to support safe and accessible rights of way.,150,,
1430,0.97,7788.847,7801.46,"Here we got some Metrics on how much litter and garbage was collected in 2021, how many hypodermic needles were collected.",150,,
1431,0.97,7801.46,7807.833,This program is making significant progress.,150,,
1432,0.97,7807.833,7808.133,Next slide.,150,,
1433,0.97,7808.133,7813.906,"More examples, before and after pictures are very compelling.",150,,
1434,0.97,7813.906,7819.011,These are pictures of Street rights of way and sidewalks.,150,,
1435,0.97,7819.011,7822.814,There's before and after work in parks.,150,,
1436,0.97,7822.814,7827.319,"The goal, just to help the entire city look cleaner over the last two years.",150,,
1437,0.97,7827.319,7834.526,"So, this has been a very successful program.",150,,
1438,0.97,7834.526,7835.561,Next slide.,150,,
1439,0.97,7835.561,7838.764,Here are more successful work.,150,,
1440,0.97,7838.764,7847.606,"I believe this photo is the Massachusetts site I think that shows the before, during and after.",150,,
1441,0.97,7847.606,7871.096,This is one of those programs where I think the Max payer is Goodell getting a--the taxpayer is getting a good bang for the buck.,150,,
1442,0.97,7871.096,7876.201,The city's contractors collect materials outside of encampment.,150,,
1443,0.97,7876.201,7889.881,"Clean city surge funding supports specially trained city staff, field Coordinators and their team working with encampment to work with campers to address trash removal and unwanted materials.",150,,
1444,0.97,7889.881,7912.437,Think about the clean city's initiative as a con see edge where we drop by encampment and not necessarily disturb the encampment but clean the litter and debris each day.,150,,
1445,0.97,7912.437,7923.515,"We make sure this work is being doesn't on this slide, this reflects the increased litter collection routes that are part of the clean city program.",150,,
1446,0.97,7923.515,7928.654,We are serving 18 neighborhoods throughout the city.,150,,
1447,0.97,7928.654,7940.832,We are cleaning more than 3500 block faces and these services are provided seven days a week.,150,,
1448,0.97,7940.832,7943.302,Next slide.,150,,
1449,0.97,7943.302,7949.041,I kind of wanted to say something when my Audio was not working.,150,,
1450,0.97,7949.041,7981.306,"I wanted to initially introduce this program as part of an effort to sort of normalize the language around unified care team and the goal of the unified care team, once again, to double down on sort of opening remarks by my colleague, Michael Bailey, this is the administration's approach to a suite of services and programs related to solutions for our Unhoused neighbors.",150,,
1451,0.97,7981.306,7986.878,The intent is to create Holistic unified approaches.,150,,
1452,0.97,7986.878,7993.185,Examples of services include the hope team which you just previously heard about.,150,,
1453,0.97,7993.185,8002.294,"The Rv Removals, housing and shelter and of course clean cities which we are here talking to you about today.",150,,
1454,0.97,8002.294,8003.261,So that concludes our presentation.,150,,
1455,0.97,8003.261,8018.043,"Then we will ask on the last slide, of course big hats off to the staff who are actually out there doing the work.",150,,
1456,0.97,8018.043,8021.513,Thank you so much.,151,,
1457,0.97,8021.513,8024.983,Is there anymore presentation from the panel here?,151,,
1458,0.97,8024.983,8027.185,Or are we all set for Council questions?,151,,
1459,0.97,8027.185,8028.887,I think we are all set.,152,,
1460,0.97,8028.887,8029.221,Excellent.,153,,
1461,0.97,8029.221,8033.091,Thank you so much for that overview.,153,,
1462,0.97,8033.091,8041.033,"Before I jump into it, colleagues are there any questions?",153,,
1463,0.97,8041.033,8041.233,Okay.,153,,
1464,0.97,8041.233,8042.167,I will get started here.,153,,
1465,0.97,8042.167,8068.293,"I certainly have been following along with and appreciate the increased work that clean city initiative has been doing over the course of the previous couple months, given the added demand due to the situation around the Covid crisis and the amount of public trash that we have seen in a lot of part offense the city.",153,,
1466,0.97,8068.293,8078.97,We appreciate the difference this team has made and appreciate the inner Department coordination to make this an effective response.,153,,
1467,0.97,8078.97,8102.794,Can we talk about how sites are identified and Prioritized and what process that goes through and what ways Councilmembers and constituents might engage with the initiative if there are potential sites we want to flag and how that in--as a threshold question.,153,,
1468,0.97,8102.794,8106.431,I might turn it over to Idris.,154,,
1469,0.97,8106.431,8107.466,"Thank you, Councilmember.",155,,
1470,0.97,8107.466,8120.579,I assume that you are speaking to--we got two options for the Rv's where we have something called a site assessment.,155,,
1471,0.97,8120.579,8137.362,"Now throughout the city the form measures a number of areas and categories including safety, hazardous waste.",155,,
1472,0.97,8137.362,8146.838,We would identify those areas through the city where we deploy an Rv remediation clean act.,155,,
1473,0.97,8146.838,8157.182,We use a site assessment form again that tallies up the number of Rv's and a few other factors.,155,,
1474,0.97,8157.182,8168.126,"For our community litter routes that we deployed, that superintendent Williams spoke of, we look at the historical at that time that.",155,,
1475,0.97,8168.126,8174.466,Data that is delivered and we use crowd Sourcing for instance.,155,,
1476,0.97,8174.466,8193.151,And based on the historical we then create heat map which we target and drill down to Proactive Literates where we know historically these areas throughout the city have been Impacketted by litter and illegal dumping.,155,,
1477,0.97,8193.151,8199.891,That's how we identified the 18 routes for that aspect of the Proactive cleans.,155,,
1478,0.97,8199.891,8217.542,"However, utilizing an equity lenses, the areas that are not reports that we do know have challenges with illegal dumping, trash and debris, we are Proactive based on the equity lens.",155,,
1479,0.97,8217.542,8218.91,"And, Councilmember --",156,,
1480,0.97,8218.91,8220.445,"Go ahead, sorry, superintendent, please.",157,,
1481,0.97,8220.445,8232.924,"I was also going to say that people can use the city's find it, fix it App or the customer service Bureau contact to make reports.",158,,
1482,0.97,8232.924,8233.258,Excellent.,159,,
1483,0.97,8233.258,8252.844,"Going back to some of the things that Idris laid out, how often are the 18 routes modified based on the equity and the analysis and the assessment of the heat maps?",159,,
1484,0.97,8252.844,8253.545,That depends.,160,,
1485,0.97,8253.545,8253.912,That depends.,160,,
1486,0.97,8253.912,8259.251,We have been in constant contact with whether it is community.,160,,
1487,0.97,8259.251,8261.686,We work closely with business improvement associations and other groups.,160,,
1488,0.97,8261.686,8268.793,"If we see a reduction in the amount of litter that is being collected, we would then Pivot.",160,,
1489,0.97,8268.793,8285.343,We would redeploy or we would Repurpose the routes in order to make sure we are being most official and targeting the places.,160,,
1490,0.97,8285.343,8287.579,We have a little more flexibility and be nimble.,160,,
1491,0.97,8287.579,8306.631,"We know there was an increase in litter and debris along that stretch, a couple miles there, so rather than create a whole new route or take away from a route, we just made the decision to say let's clean along that stretch.",160,,
1492,0.97,8306.631,8307.966,"So, it is ongoing.",160,,
1493,0.97,8307.966,8314.172,We are in constant assessment and utilized community and data to tell us where to Pivot.,160,,
1494,0.97,8314.172,8323.448,"What is the capacity to do this on demand cleans, how many can be done in a given month or quarter?",161,,
1495,0.97,8323.448,8324.449,It just depends.,162,,
1496,0.97,8324.449,8340.265,"You know, I know that for the On-Demand one we have done with the North Lake way, I'm assuming--Lee can Chime in--we probably deployed five or eight based on the surge, the available funding.",162,,
1497,0.97,8340.265,8349.908,"So in addition to the 18 community Literates, we can deploy them five or eight.",162,,
1498,0.97,8349.908,8353.978,Additional Fundings were added for the go cleans.,162,,
1499,0.97,8353.978,8370.695,So the--meaning that we target areas that are Impacketted by Rv's that might not be more than five or seven long standing issues and we deploy--how many do we deploy a month for the Geo cleans?,162,,
1500,0.97,8370.695,8371.062,Around 30.,163,,
1501,0.97,8371.062,8371.429,Yeah.,164,,
1502,0.97,8371.429,8377.035,30 a month right now.,165,,
1503,0.97,8377.035,8382.273,"So that's geographical targeted cleans, Councilmember, Lewis.",166,,
1504,0.97,8382.273,8396.221,"Going back to--well the On- demand clean can say, at what point is a potential source of garbage so large it can't be mitigated through clean cities?",167,,
1505,0.97,8396.221,8422.247,"To give a particular example of something that I think is still mostly Unaddressed or partially addressed, there's a site in my district like where a boat was just dumped in a completely destroyed state, like, torn apart, graffiti, you know, all the windows broken out of it.",167,,
1506,0.97,8422.247,8423.181,Like a motor boat.,167,,
1507,0.97,8423.181,8423.681,Abandoned.,167,,
1508,0.97,8423.681,8437.495,"At what point is something so large that the team can't address it or if there's, you know, a debris or obstruction of any kind, is the team equipped to mitigate it?",167,,
1509,0.97,8437.495,8443.401,"Based on our inner departmental partnerships you spoke of, we have a lot of resources and partners that step in.",168,,
1510,0.97,8443.401,8455.58,"For instance, for the boat that was abandoned, which we do come across them receiver tiles a year, we have to work with S- DOT.",168,,
1511,0.97,8455.58,8461.853,We have to make sure everything was in place and shut down the road.,168,,
1512,0.97,8461.853,8463.855,S-Dot Coms out and DISPOSES of it.,168,,
1513,0.97,8463.855,8470.395,"I personally, since I have been doing this work, have not seen an issue we could not resolve.",168,,
1514,0.97,8470.395,8470.662,Nice.,169,,
1515,0.97,8470.662,8473.898,"Well, I think that boat is still out there on 15th.",169,,
1516,0.97,8473.898,8477.101,"So let's be in touch, you know.",169,,
1517,0.97,8477.101,8481.472,I set you up with the question and --,169,,
1518,0.97,8481.472,8483.875,"Yeah, let me know.",170,,
1519,0.97,8483.875,8484.142,Okay.,171,,
1520,0.97,8484.142,8487.078,But I just want to clarify that question because it was unclear.,171,,
1521,0.97,8487.078,8489.581,"I was like, well, you know, it is not a car.",171,,
1522,0.97,8489.581,8496.254,"I don't know if this is appearing--so,.",171,,
1523,0.97,8496.254,8499.023,Send us an Email.,172,,
1524,0.97,8499.023,8506.931,Thank you for clarifying about that as a treasure hold matter.,173,,
1525,0.97,8506.931,8518.843,We run into constituent request for large pieces of debris.,173,,
1526,0.97,8518.843,8530.688,We have to make sure we have the right size flat beds to pull a boat out of an area.,173,,
1527,0.97,8530.688,8531.155,Yeah.,174,,
1528,0.97,8531.155,8531.456,Understood.,174,,
1529,0.97,8531.456,8532.09,Appreciate the clarification.,174,,
1530,0.97,8532.09,8532.624,Superintendent Williams?,174,,
1531,0.97,8532.624,8541.132,I was going say that the park Department will also supplement cleaning through a program we call Jamborees.,175,,
1532,0.97,8541.132,8554.746,"That is where we bring together, sort of the compliment of our grounds and maintenance crews from all over the Department to ascend on a park.",175,,
1533,0.97,8554.746,8563.288,We don't do Jamborees on publically owned Right-Of-Ways.,175,,
1534,0.97,8563.288,8572.163,So that is an ongoing approach to--kind of an internal companion piece to clean cities.,175,,
1535,0.97,8572.163,8579.337,Is there an opening superintendent Williams for volunteers who might want to participate in the activities?,176,,
1536,0.97,8579.337,8588.746,"You know, there's a threshold of work that is suitable for volunteers.",177,,
1537,0.97,8588.746,8592.817,"You know, maybe on the education side, on the litter pickup side.",177,,
1538,0.97,8592.817,8603.594,A lot of the work we are talking about is Proal not suitable for volunteers.,177,,
1539,0.97,8603.594,8618.509,"Blood born pathogens from hypodermic needles and there's frequently a lot of debris that, you know, paid and staff trained are to do.",177,,
1540,0.97,8618.509,8619.41,Yeah.,178,,
1541,0.97,8619.41,8626.751,"But it does sound like on litter pick and Remediate, there's a possible --",178,,
1542,0.97,8626.751,8627.485,Absolutely.,179,,
1543,0.97,8627.485,8646.471,"I would encourage the initiative to maybe work with us here at the Council in the scope of the categories you identified around litter picks and remediation, to scope out opportunities to get people involved.",180,,
1544,0.97,8646.471,8654.812,We on the Council get large volumes of people who see the state of the city want to step up and ways to engage.,180,,
1545,0.97,8654.812,8672.664,This might be a way to accommodate it to rope folks in to be a part of making the city better and encourage an opportunity to figure out how we might do that.,180,,
1546,0.97,8672.664,8680.772,I know we have talked about a city-wide day of service potentially later in the spring.,180,,
1547,0.97,8680.772,8688.713,"I think that is born out of what Mayor Harrell heard on the campaign, people wanting to help.",180,,
1548,0.97,8688.713,8697.989,This could be a way we can plug people in and give them the opportunity to serve in some of our efforts.,180,,
1549,0.97,8697.989,8698.489,Councilmember Herbold.,180,,
1550,0.97,8698.489,8698.856,Thank you.,181,,
1551,0.97,8698.856,8710.301,"I was not going into this area because I didn't think we were going talk about Rv's, but we did.",181,,
1552,0.97,8710.301,8716.841,My ears perked up when I heard reference to the Rv remediation program.,181,,
1553,0.97,8716.841,8723.014,The go cleans I think you call them.,181,,
1554,0.97,8723.014,8732.156,"And I know there are locations where there are Rv's, people are leaving them all over the city.",181,,
1555,0.97,8732.156,8735.026,We have--the Council has funded a safe lot program.,181,,
1556,0.97,8735.026,8738.196,The dollars have gone to King County.,181,,
1557,0.97,8738.196,8741.766,They are--we expect to see great stuff coming out of the Rp.,181,,
1558,0.97,8741.766,8759.016,I just want to take this opportunity to say that I have and Councilmember Mosqueda and neighbor have a very large Rv encampment in the Andover neighborhood.,181,,
1559,0.97,8759.016,8765.756,It has been there for three years.,181,,
1560,0.97,8765.756,8769.727,It predates the Covid-19 emergency.,181,,
1561,0.97,8769.727,8775.366,It is in a residential neighborhood.,181,,
1562,0.97,8775.366,8779.103,It is not in an industrial neighborhood.,181,,
1563,0.97,8779.103,8797.755,"And, as I think both Councilmember Mosqueda and I have expressed many times, the community, the service providers that work in that area, the community organizations are really at their wit's end and would like some relief.",181,,
1564,0.97,8797.755,8809.367,"And, we have done a lot I think to make sure that the previous administration was aware of this location.",181,,
1565,0.97,8809.367,8819.61,I understood why we were--why it was that we were suspended enforcement of the 72-Hour notice.,181,,
1566,0.97,8819.61,8824.582,We have had meetings with members of the new administration.,181,,
1567,0.97,8824.582,8837.428,We had a meeting in early February to follow up and sharing with the new administration a community letter from new core about the Impackets.,181,,
1568,0.97,8837.428,8841.699,Followed up with the meeting in February.,181,,
1569,0.97,8841.699,8861.686,"Requested that folks--I know Spu, you guys have been out there and you respond to my calls when I ask you to go out there and do a bag pickup or ask you to do another round with the Geo cleans with people in place, not requiring them to move their vehicles.",181,,
1570,0.97,8861.686,8877.635,"But the Rv situation, I really Hink people need a Brea don't--I'm frustrated having had--under the prior administration it was in April of 2021.",181,,
1571,0.97,8877.635,8887.979,"There was the conversation--well, there was a statement that they ha lifted the enforcement of the 72-Hour ordinance but then that was never implemented.",181,,
1572,0.97,8887.979,8895.62,"We have--I don't think we have anybody from S-Dot here, maybe we do.",181,,
1573,0.97,8895.62,8903.527,We have done enforcement of the 72-Hour ordinance as it relates to clearly abandoned vehicles.,181,,
1574,0.97,8903.527,8912.837,I know that we--the Rv mediation program has experienced very good compliance in the past.,181,,
1575,0.97,8912.837,8926.984,"Often that was after I know--I know it was after a lot of engagement, but the people voluntarily, when they have operable vehicles when they know there is is threat of enforcement.",181,,
1576,0.97,8926.984,8942.233,"I have, you know, sort of a--probably hearing me say I have a little different approach towards sharing public space when people are living in vehicles.",181,,
1577,0.97,8942.233,8954.912,I asked for more of a--an approach that is patient and works with people where they are at and the takes time for engagement when it comes to people who are living in their--in tents outside.,181,,
1578,0.97,8954.912,8961.385,"When people are living in their vehicles, I think folks should be asked to move periodically.",181,,
1579,0.97,8961.385,8962.887,I just really do.,181,,
1580,0.97,8962.887,8963.487,This is just a plea.,181,,
1581,0.97,8963.487,8975.633,I don't know that there's anybody on this panel that can speak to the future of enforcement of the 72-Hour notice or 72-Hour parking law.,181,,
1582,0.97,8975.633,8985.042,"Again, we had a meeting in early February about precisely this issue.",181,,
1583,0.97,8985.042,8986.177,I have not had follow-up.,181,,
1584,0.97,8986.177,8990.381,People are pleading with me to do something in this area.,181,,
1585,0.97,8990.381,8993.484,Councilmember Herbold--go ahead.,182,,
1586,0.97,8993.484,8995.886,You probably have a more precise answer.,183,,
1587,0.97,8995.886,9006.397,"I was going to say from the parks perspective, we would absolutely take this back to the unified care team for discussion.",183,,
1588,0.97,9006.397,9007.598,Yeah.,184,,
1589,0.97,9007.598,9014.038,"And along the same lines, Councilmember Herbold, I appreciate your insight.",184,,
1590,0.97,9014.038,9015.206,We have been working diligently.,184,,
1591,0.97,9015.206,9021.645,"At this juncture, we are posting with the Rv mediation program.",184,,
1592,0.97,9021.645,9029.22,We are doing posting and doing compassion and compliance really trying to work with them to voluntarily move.,184,,
1593,0.97,9029.22,9040.865,At this juncture we know that S- DOT is working on the 72-Hour enforcement and there should be something soon coming out to provide some assistance in that area.,184,,
1594,0.97,9040.865,9048.706,"To superintendent Williams point, we definitely will bring it back to the unified care team.",184,,
1595,0.97,9048.706,9056.881,"And if I may just for a second, I want to talk about the adopt a street program.",185,,
1596,0.97,9056.881,9061.652,"If we have volunteers, the adopt a street program is thriving.",185,,
1597,0.97,9061.652,9065.723,It stopped and started back up in April.,185,,
1598,0.97,9065.723,9068.025,We will getting lots of folks.,185,,
1599,0.97,9068.025,9071.228,It help's with people that want to paint over graffiti.,185,,
1600,0.97,9071.228,9075.566,You need to get the business owner a waiver if it is private property.,185,,
1601,0.97,9075.566,9082.64,"We can get you the paint and the rollers, same as the adopt a street, we get you a bag and utensils to clean up.",185,,
1602,0.97,9082.64,9085.576,We will come pick those things up.,185,,
1603,0.97,9085.576,9088.179,You can find the fix it App.,185,,
1604,0.97,9088.179,9090.648,There's lots of way to volunteer.,185,,
1605,0.97,9090.648,9093.084,Our program manager is great and has a passion for it.,185,,
1606,0.97,9093.084,9097.988,When I drive afternoon the if I recollect I see her out there picking up garbage all the time.,185,,
1607,0.97,9097.988,9108.432,Let us know and we would love to have help volunteer for that program.,185,,
1608,0.97,9108.432,9113.904,Anymore questions from colleagues?,186,,
1609,0.97,9113.904,9139.83,"Councilmember month category 3 #Á Councilmember Moss Kay did a, I appreciate trying to have many departments involved and in a nongovernmental entity.",187,,
1610,0.97,9139.83,9141.999,I am guessing and these are other areas across the city as well.,187,,
1611,0.97,9143.734,9151.342,I tried to make a comment about this earlier to mark and the Rh crew but I will try to reiterate the point.,188,,
1612,0.97,9151.342,9183.274,"I am concerned that as people will getting moved out of downtown potentially or if there are Sweeps in other areas of the city, individuals who are fearful of the postings, for whatever reason or are not able to get into shelter or move because of a posting, that they are coming to other areas where they see folks Unhoused established and I think that is occurring in the areas that were traditionally more vehicles and Rvs.",188,,
1613,0.97,9183.274,9187.511,I am seeing a lot of people in tents and sleeping bags.,188,,
1614,0.97,9187.511,9192.683,"This is to put it on the radar, this compliment it is work of your members.",188,,
1615,0.97,9192.683,9203.761,If you are doing cleanup for items that were trash and were identified by folks as part of the purple bag program and clearly being placed in an area for pickup.,188,,
1616,0.97,9203.761,9208.199,"If there's more folks in that area, that complicates your work.",188,,
1617,0.97,9208.199,9213.904,Thank you for taking the suggestion because ever back because I think it is a City- wide Stu.,188,,
1618,0.97,9213.904,9225.349,"As you see more folks being affected going places where Rv's and cars are parked, it is going to complicate the work of trying to create cleaner areas.",188,,
1619,0.97,9225.349,9229.553,So thank you for taking that back to the coordinated team.,188,,
1620,0.97,9229.553,9236.76,This will maybe be a good example here of how we can try to get the folks into housing.,188,,
1621,0.97,9236.76,9241.098,Councilmember Herbold and I also worked on safe parking lots.,188,,
1622,0.97,9241.098,9246.17,I think that's an important element that has not stood up.,188,,
1623,0.97,9246.17,9253.577,The Rv safe parking lots say there's not waste outside.,188,,
1624,0.97,9253.577,9266.523,"And then Lastly, I would very much like to follow up with how it is going to find more places fo us to open up Restrooms and facilities.",188,,
1625,0.97,9266.523,9275.699,"We had funded some efforts around, Port-A-Potties.",188,,
1626,0.97,9275.699,9287.778,"If you have ideas for all of us, folks out for a ride or tourist in the area or what have you, we want people to have a place to use the Restroom.",188,,
1627,0.97,9287.778,9297.655,That's an area of deep concern that we have not seen Atremendous amount of hygiene facilities open up.,188,,
1628,0.97,9297.655,9299.023,That's something Councilmember Morales worked on.,188,,
1629,0.97,9299.023,9303.627,"If no time today, maybe a follow-up at some point.",188,,
1630,0.97,9303.627,9304.395,Thank you.,189,,
1631,0.97,9304.395,9309.466,Definitely would appreciate if we can follow up off line with the hygiene.,189,,
1632,0.97,9309.466,9321.145,I know there's a lot of work and efforts being put in and reassessing what that objective might look like.,189,,
1633,0.97,9321.145,9322.78,I do appreciate that.,189,,
1634,0.97,9322.78,9323.681,All right.,190,,
1635,0.97,9323.681,9324.348,Thank you so much.,190,,
1636,0.97,9324.348,9328.919,Do we have any other questions from Council colleagues?,190,,
1637,0.97,9328.919,9330.754,It does not appear we do.,190,,
1638,0.97,9330.754,9331.088,Okay.,190,,
1639,0.97,9331.088,9335.225,Thank you so much for dropping by and giving this presentation.,190,,
1640,0.97,9335.225,9343.467,"I think it would be good to just get an occasional update, maybe quarterly update from clean cities.",190,,
1641,0.97,9343.467,9347.871,I appreciate having the information to share at Council briefing every week from this team.,190,,
1642,0.97,9347.871,9354.912,But it does seem like there's going to be continued demand in the near term for the work you guys are doing.,190,,
1643,0.97,9354.912,9365.055,"If there's ever a big change in circumstances or some big developments that you want to report on, always happy to have you come to Committee and thank you so much for making yourselves available.",190,,
1644,0.97,9365.055,9367.624,Thank you for the invitation.,191,,

1647,0.97,9370.828,9371.929,Take care.,193,,
1648,0.97,9371.929,9372.129,Bye.,193,,
1649,0.97,9372.129,9372.496,All right.,194,,
