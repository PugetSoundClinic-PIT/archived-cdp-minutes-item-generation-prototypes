62,0.97,291.491,291.724,Yeah.,19,,
63,0.97,291.724,292.925,You gave everybody the wrong I.,19,,
64,0.97,292.925,297.13,D. so that's why no one is here.,19,,
65,0.97,297.13,297.43,Yes.,20,,
66,0.97,297.43,297.764,We understand.,20,,
67,0.97,297.764,298.164,Good morning.,21,,
68,0.97,298.164,309.409,"Last Saturday the Seattle times covered the story of Howard McKay, a retired longshoreman who was brutally assaulted in his own home by Seattle police two years ago.",21,,
69,0.97,309.409,323.523,"The city has now given McKay $250,000 of our tax money to settle the lawsuit that resulted from this abuse of an elderly white Seattle Homeowner, but the city has not given Mr. McKay any amount of police accountability.",21,,
70,0.97,323.523,341.474,"In fact, when OPA director Andrew Meyerburg investigated, he deemed it, quote, lawful and proper after doing an Oig approved expedited investigation without even bothering to interview the officers involved.",21,,
71,0.97,341.474,360.46,"This highlights the scandal by Carolyn VICK in South Seattle last month concerning the willingness of Oig to support the failed investigation that deemed, quote, lawful and proper all manner of SPD abuse and killing.",21,,
72,0.97,360.46,365.565,"If that E expose was not enough to move you, they also ruled last year it was also lawful and proper.",21,,
73,0.97,365.565,377.009,"In the coming weeks, I promise, you will learn of more scandals Embroiling the Oig.",21,,
74,0.97,377.009,382.582,They fall in service to a Mythical belief that Seattle has a functioning police accountability system.,21,,
75,0.97,382.582,396.462,Maybe now you feel you've struck a blow for equity when you can also turn a blind eye to the abuse of a white middle class Seattle Homeowner of 48 years.,21,,
76,0.97,396.462,404.67,"Councilmembers, for God's sake, when will you take seriously your oversight responsibilities?",21,,
77,0.97,404.67,417.45,This shows the need to have full control over misconduct investigations.,21,,

89,0.97,448.08,452.952,I'm calling in support of the criminal legal system task force recommendation.,26,,
90,0.97,452.952,461.727,This is a reminder that the city needs to divest the legal system.,26,,
91,0.97,461.727,465.431,90% go through are indigent and qualify for public defenders.,26,,
92,0.97,465.431,472.104,There are many more ways to address poverty and housing crisis beyond Criminalization of poor people.,26,,
93,0.97,472.104,473.306,Criminalizing poor people ain't the way.,26,,
94,0.97,473.306,484.884,This is another reminder that the communities on all sides are asking you to divest from the criminal legal system and really critically invest in community members and organizations.,26,,
95,0.97,484.884,487.019,A budget is more than a document of the city government.,26,,
96,0.97,487.019,494.56,This report asks for you all to consider the ways in which current legal reforms cannot be separated from Healthcare and other policies.,26,,
97,0.97,494.56,500.8,We ask you to take a Holistic approach in addressing harm in the city that is reflected in the city's budget.,26,,
98,0.97,500.8,504.203,This community is asking for a new normal.,26,,
99,0.97,504.203,506.138,Stop the Criminalization of poor folks.,26,,
100,0.97,506.138,510.142,Actually show compassion and support all of our community members.,26,,
101,0.97,510.142,513.746,And I relinquish the rest of my time.,26,,

107,0.97,525.925,526.926,And good morning.,28,,
108,0.97,526.926,532.365,I would like to raise the accessibility concerns that happened this morning.,28,,
109,0.97,532.365,548.481,There was the need to actually required to go and respond back to and get corrected information was a hindrance for a lot of people to be there and be on time and actually be in the space.,28,,
110,0.97,548.481,551.25,So I wanted to really highlight that as well.,28,,
111,0.97,551.25,557.557,"So that's my first thing, but hello and good morning, Council, and the general public.",28,,
112,0.97,557.557,561.294,I'm here to talk and say truth to power and institutional power.,28,,
113,0.97,561.294,562.628,Who is leading the task force?,28,,
114,0.97,562.628,576.142,The task force was convened from September 2020 to may 2021 under the auspices of civil rights.,28,,
115,0.97,576.142,578.411,The director is Marico Lockhart.,28,,
116,0.97,578.411,580.68,We've reached out to alternatives to policing Rfp.,28,,
117,0.97,580.68,593.192,It is 17 pages long with the first two pages filled with accolades on how the office of civil rights is engaging the community for this grant and is funding history.,28,,
118,0.97,593.192,601.2,This is specifically for funding resources for black people and black Transgender people of Seattle.,28,,
119,0.97,601.2,607.206,"The packet shows a due date of October 4, 2021, for the Rfp.",28,,
120,0.97,607.206,611.577,The landing page isn't even highlighted on the main civil rights page at all.,28,,
121,0.97,611.577,619.051,"You Scroll down, see fine print under a graphic that says this Rfp is actually due September 27.",28,,
122,0.97,619.051,623.422,How is this accessible to the communities who it proposes to help and provide resources for?,28,,
123,0.97,623.422,632.765,"How do we trust anything presented and put forth by a department who can't even be responsive for a community resource, let alone be led by an alternative to community safety?",28,,
124,0.97,632.765,644.143,"Action shows that the words are hollow and the strategic use of popular social justice jargon like harm reduction, accountability and transparency.",28,,
125,0.97,644.143,645.811,How is this office being accountable?,28,,
126,0.97,645.811,652.385,I invite the Council and the public to hold institutions and those who run them accountable for their actions.,28,,
127,0.97,652.385,657.089,Thank you so much for that information.,29,,

132,0.97,672.505,677.91,I want to first say that I respect the right of the people to sovereignty and self determination.,30,,
133,0.97,677.91,687.887,I want to acknowledge Secondly as a white person that the racial justice movement must be led by people of color.,30,,
134,0.97,687.887,688.788,The fight for racial justice.,30,,
135,0.97,688.788,695.695,"Thirdly, I am speaking here because I am a disabled person from Seattle who has suffered in Healthcare institutions and at the hand of law enforcement.",30,,
136,0.97,695.695,711.343,"Despite the fact that I have experienced oppression as a person with disabilities, I acknowledge that the privilege Begat by my whiteness is actually why I'm still here with my medical needs met and my heart still alive and pounding in my head.",30,,
137,0.97,711.343,713.746,I particularly agree with recommendation no.,30,,
138,0.97,713.746,719.185,6 and the practice of mental health treatment and accommodation of people with disabilities.,30,,
139,0.97,719.185,754.286,"With this recommendation, that honors the young woman that I used to be, a woman with a mental illness repeatedly harassed by the Seattle police Department, injected with unwanted medication when not physically Compliant, a woman who against her will was repeatedly hospitalized as the underlying issues could never be revolved by the status quo, a woman who succumbed to sex traffickers.",30,,
140,0.97,754.286,761.794,I worked as a community resource specialist to reach those behind bars.,30,,
141,0.97,761.794,770.903,"Those engaged in the sex trade, the community needs to be educated.",30,,
142,0.97,770.903,777.276,I want to [Indiscernible] saved my life and many others in the sex trade.,30,,

149,0.97,794.26,802.168,"Good morning, Seattle city council.",32,,
150,0.97,802.168,803.869,My name is Nikita Oliver.,32,,
151,0.97,803.869,809.909,I am a member of the budget coalition and executive director of creative justice.,32,,
152,0.97,809.909,834.833,"I call this morning because I want to voice support for the criminal legal system task force recommendations and I deeply want to thank those community members, many of whom are some of the most impacted and our most marginalized communities for their time, energy, and efforts to share from the front lines of the crisis of the criminal punishment system what they know will change the material conditions of our communities.",32,,
153,0.97,834.833,842.608,"In the past year and a half, we have seen an uprising around the issue and role of policing in our city.",32,,
154,0.97,842.608,862.127,"We have heard a lot of important data around the criminal legal system, one of which is that 90% of people who are pushed through municipal courts qualify for a public defender, which means they're found indigent which means as a city, we are often Criminalizing and prosecuting people for being poor.",32,,
155,0.97,862.127,870.102,So I ask as you hear from this community led task force today that you take seriously their recommendations as you move through the 2022 budget.,32,,
156,0.97,870.102,900.633,"We need to make serious changes to the way in which we meet people's basic needs, understanding that housing and Healthcare are two major determinants to whether or not people are pushed into the criminal legal system and continue our efforts to shrink a failed system of public safety that is not able to deliver on its promise and actually build a system of public health and public safety that not only meets people's needs but helps us move beyond police as our primary method of achieving community health because it doesn't work.",32,,
157,0.97,900.633,903.502,It does not deliver on that promise.,32,,
158,0.97,903.502,924.356,"I hope that you will take seriously the experience that will be brought in front of you today as both professional and important experience for determination what a thriving, healthy Seattle looks like, especially for our black, native, and Brown community members.",32,,
159,0.97,924.356,924.757,Thank you.,33,,
160,0.97,924.757,929.261,Our next Speaker is showing as not present.,33,,
161,0.97,929.261,931.764,We'll return to bill Jenkins.,33,,
162,0.97,931.764,942.908,"Next we have--I should know by now, Anhelica Chizaro.",33,,
163,0.97,942.908,943.309,Good morning.,34,,
164,0.97,943.309,947.579,I'm a member of Decriminalize Seattle and the budget coalition.,34,,
165,0.97,947.579,956.956,I'm calling this morning to voice my full support for the task force recommendations that as you know are put forward by community members with direct experience in our punishment system.,34,,
166,0.97,956.956,965.998,In the past year and a half we've had a reckoning with the role of policing in our city and it's past time to extend that reckoning to other parts of the criminal legal system.,34,,
167,0.97,965.998,981.146,"At this point our misdemeanor punishment system as you've already heard this morning, the municipal court, is primarily a system for punishing poor people with 90% of the people Cycling through needing public defenders because they are poor.",34,,
168,0.97,981.146,995.094,"As you consider the 2022 budget, I ask that you take seriously the recommendations of this report to Prioritize universal needs such as housing and Healthcare and shrinking policing and criminal punishment in Seattle.",34,,
169,0.97,995.094,1001.7,We can't continue to try to Tweak with more reforms to make it friendlier for the poor people who it targets.,34,,
170,0.97,1001.7,1012.378,We need to address root causes and the 2022 budget needs to divest from policing and focus on black and indigenous communities.,34,,
171,0.97,1012.378,1017.983,I thank the task force for their work and I look forward to seeing the recommendations implemented.,34,,
172,0.97,1017.983,1018.283,Thank you.,34,,
173,0.97,1018.283,1018.617,Thank you.,35,,
174,0.97,1018.617,1025.624,That is our last Speaker that is showing up as present this morning.,35,,
175,0.97,1025.624,1035.834,"We have bill Jenkins, who is still listed as not present, and we'll filibuster here a little bit and see if that changes.",35,,
176,0.97,1035.834,1038.303,It doesn't seem to be changing.,35,,
177,0.97,1038.303,1042.141,"That being the case, we will end public comment.",35,,
178,0.97,1042.141,1046.812,And we'll move into the first item on today's agenda.,35,,
179,0.97,1046.812,1051.784,Will the clerk please read into the agenda the first item.,35,,
180,0.97,1051.784,1053.285,Agenda item no.,36,,

182,0.97,1058.023,1058.29,Great.,37,,
183,0.97,1058.29,1058.69,Thank you so much.,37,,
184,0.97,1058.69,1067.933,I'm wondering if first we have a lot of folks who are joining us today to participate in the presentation.,37,,
185,0.97,1067.933,1095.994,"I think what we'll do is, if we could just do a really quick round of introductions just your name and affiliation, and then I'm going to have just a few opening remarks just to provide some background to this work, and then we'll turn it over to you and you will have the floor to lead us through your recommendations.",37,,
186,0.97,1095.994,1108.106,"And so with that, Asha, do you mind starting off introductions?",37,,
187,0.97,1108.106,1109.141,No problem.,38,,

217,0.97,1220.185,1221.386,You're muted.,54,,
218,0.97,1221.386,1222.821,Good morning.,55,,
219,0.97,1222.821,1226.024,"My name is Liletha Williams, they call me Ms. Litha.",55,,
220,0.97,1226.024,1235.534,I do a lot of community work but today I'm here as a task force member and I will pass it to--has everybody gone?,55,,
221,0.97,1235.534,1237.069,I think so.,56,,
222,0.97,1237.069,1239.538,"Yes, everybody --",57,,
223,0.97,1239.538,1255.787,"Well, except for Jarral isn't here, but Elle isn't here, but we want to make space for his voice in this presentation, and we want to make space and acknowledge all that he was able to contribute and all the power in the room.",58,,
224,0.97,1255.787,1261.56,"I really want to appreciate all the folks able to show up, their brilliance.",58,,
225,0.97,1261.56,1261.827,Thank you.,58,,
226,0.97,1261.827,1263.762,Really appreciate everybody joining us today.,59,,
227,0.97,1263.762,1266.798,"Just a little bit of background and like I said, I'll turn it over to you.",59,,
228,0.97,1266.798,1273.472,"This is your time to present to us, and the listening public, just the background.",59,,
229,0.97,1273.472,1292.591,"For the past year, individuals impacted by the criminal legal system have been meeting as a task force convened by the Seattle office of civil rights to develop recommendations for policy changes to the criminal legal system that will as their goal, one, reduce as much harm as possible.",59,,
230,0.97,1292.591,1297.796,"Two, prevent people from ending up in the system to begin with.",59,,
231,0.97,1297.796,1307.773,"The result is a report entitled ""centering impacted voices,"" with a link on today's agenda.",59,,
232,0.97,1307.773,1314.313,This morning task force members are here to present their recommendations.,59,,
233,0.97,1314.313,1341.039,"As a reminder, this task force recommendation is part of a broader work plan that the Council sought and we heard the first part of that work plan or work product in July of this year where the Council committee heard a presentation on the criminal legal system realignment strategic plan from former Federal staff member Carlos Lugo.",59,,
234,0.97,1341.039,1356.054,The presentation resulted from funding in the 2019 budget when Ouncil President Gonzalez funded a term limit position in the legislative Department to write a strategic plan.,59,,
235,0.97,1356.054,1376.541,The funding also provided resources for a position in the office of civil rights to coordinate Stakeholder engagement around the development of the strategic plan and the roles of realigning the criminal legal system.,59,,
236,0.97,1376.541,1386.885,"That strategic plan was entitled realigning Seattle's criminal legal system, the intersection between community legal system and safe practices.",59,,
237,0.97,1386.885,1397.395,That was an outcome of previous rounds of engagement identifying community guiding principles which served as a foundation for research on crime.,59,,
238,0.97,1397.395,1413.512,"And again I want to really lift up the element that we're here to hear about today, which was also a required element of this strategic plan.",59,,
239,0.97,1413.512,1427.826,"It was a separate, Stand-Alone report from the task force on their recommendation for realignment of the traditional criminal legal system.",59,,
240,0.97,1427.826,1440.772,"And so with that, I just want to pause real quickly to see if Asha has any opening remarks to add to that background.",59,,
241,0.97,1440.772,1445.076,We'll hand it over to the Presenters after that.,59,,
242,0.97,1445.076,1451.65,"To community members, I just want to make a request that if we could, we'll hold questions until the end.",59,,
243,0.97,1451.65,1455.287,Then we'll are time for questions and discussions.,59,,
244,0.97,1455.287,1455.954,"Asha, anything to add?",59,,
245,0.97,1455.954,1459.491,You covered most of what I would have said.,60,,
246,0.97,1459.491,1462.394,I'll just add a couple things.,60,,
247,0.97,1462.394,1486.818,"You had mentioned that this project started back in 2018 during discussions of the 2019 budget, and a lot of the impetus for moving forward for figuring out how to Realign the system is because so many asks are coming in from the executive, Councilmembers, from the community and it wasn't really clear that all of the asks were going in the same directions.",60,,
248,0.97,1486.818,1497.128,Some of them could have been working at cross purposes and it was a matter of getting everybody on the same page and to be really clear about what we were trying to do in terms of the criminal legal system.,60,,
249,0.97,1497.128,1522.087,"So over the past couple years, the task force has been meeting and both building capacity, learning about the institutional side of the system, to add to their already lived experience of the system in coming up with these recommendations as a way to move forward on getting everybody on the same page, so I just would add that.",60,,
250,0.97,1522.087,1522.42,Thank you.,61,,
251,0.97,1522.42,1522.921,All right.,61,,
252,0.97,1522.921,1525.123,So from the task force would like to begin?,61,,
253,0.97,1525.123,1526.992,I think that --,61,,
254,0.97,1526.992,1527.959,Excuse me.,62,,
255,0.97,1527.959,1528.326,Excuse me.,62,,
256,0.97,1528.326,1529.127,"I'm sorry for interrupting, but --",62,,
257,0.97,1529.127,1532.264,I was handing it over to you.,63,,
258,0.97,1532.264,1534.866,You're not interrupting.,63,,
259,0.97,1534.866,1535.433,Go for it.,63,,
260,0.97,1535.433,1536.401,Thank you.,64,,
261,0.97,1536.401,1538.036,Can Jm introduce herself?,64,,
262,0.97,1538.036,1541.806,She's part of our team and we forgot to introduce her.,64,,
263,0.97,1541.806,1546.378,"If she can introduce herself, we would appreciate that.",64,,
264,0.97,1546.378,1547.145,Luteally.,65,,
265,0.97,1547.145,1547.345,Hi.,66,,
266,0.97,1547.345,1548.68,I'm Jm Wong.,66,,
267,0.97,1548.68,1552.05,"I'm here as part of Focr, policy analyst and here to support the task force.",66,,
268,0.97,1552.05,1555.954,"I'll be sharing the slides, so I'll do that right now.",66,,
269,0.97,1555.954,1557.556,Thank you.,66,,
270,0.97,1557.556,1558.256,"Thank you very much, Jm.",67,,
271,0.97,1558.39,1567.966,Okay.,68,,
272,0.97,1567.966,1578.71,"So we're going to begin by saying thank you, Councilmembers, for creating space for this task force presentation.",68,,
273,0.97,1578.71,1589.02,"My name is Liletha Williams, and I'm a member of the task force and we've been here for a year now and we're here to present the recommendations to the city.",68,,
274,0.97,1589.02,1595.527,This presentation is accompanied by a report from impacted voices which summarizes our recommendations and perspectives.,68,,
275,0.97,1595.527,1602.133,We hope you've had the chance to read it and you can also find this report on the Socr Website.,68,,
276,0.97,1602.133,1605.737,This is a road map for our presentation today.,68,,
277,0.97,1605.737,1613.745,"We will start by beginning about who we are, our acknowledgments, and who we are calling into the space.",68,,
278,0.97,1613.745,1625.523,Next we will share the principles of Community-Led solutions that ground our recommendations and that we ask you to center in any efforts to reduce the harm of the criminal legal system.,68,,
279,0.97,1625.523,1630.829,We will then give you an overview of eight recommendations and highlight a few to discuss in depth.,68,,
280,0.97,1630.829,1640.772,I'm going to hand it off now to KL to introduce the task force again.,68,,
281,0.97,1640.772,1641.206,Good morning.,69,,
282,0.97,1641.206,1652.484,Our work group started off with nine people impacted by the various aspects of the criminal legal system and King County.,69,,
283,0.97,1652.484,1670.835,"We have each experienced the trauma of Incarceration, either through confinement or through the emotional, financial, mental, and physical toll it takes on us as we journey with our loved ones who are locked up, and also as we support them through their Reentry.",69,,
284,0.97,1670.835,1677.042,The trauma of Incarceration and the way it impacts our communities is often minimized.,69,,
285,0.97,1677.042,1689.554,"We come to this work with the urgency of black, indigenous, people of color, and poor people who are directly impacted.",69,,
286,0.97,1689.554,1692.924,Our experiences and histories inform our principles.,69,,
287,0.97,1692.924,1721.319,"We do not separate criminal legal system recommendations and reforms from policies around housing, Healthcare, education, and drugs we certainly know that the housing crisis, Gentrification, displacement, of our communities are one of the major causes of interaction with the police in the criminal legal system.",69,,
288,0.97,1721.319,1729.527,Accountability means we don't leave each other behind.,69,,
289,0.97,1729.527,1742.373,"Our queer Transcommunities, our native communities, black communities, survival is Criminalized.",69,,
290,0.97,1742.373,1750.148,"We center Antiracism, disability justice, and gender justices in our recommendations.",69,,
291,0.97,1750.148,1752.951,We speak from the communities we come from.,69,,
292,0.97,1752.951,1754.986,These are our task force members.,69,,
293,0.97,1754.986,1765.196,I'm now going to pass it on to Sela to talk about our land acknowledgment and introduce our principles of community led solutions.,69,,
294,0.97,1765.196,1765.463,Thank you.,69,,
295,0.97,1765.463,1765.797,Thank you.,70,,
296,0.97,1765.797,1766.498,This is Sela.,70,,
297,0.97,1766.498,1781.713,"Before we move into the content of our presentation, we would like to acknowledge that we are on the traditional land of the first people of Seattle, Duwamish people past and present.",70,,
298,0.97,1781.713,1786.584,We honor the people and the tribe.,70,,
299,0.97,1786.584,1797.796,We understand that our collective administration including the dismantling of the complex cannot happen without the sovereignty and resistance of our indigenous relatives.,70,,
300,0.97,1797.796,1807.906,"We acknowledge the suffering of those currently incarcerated, those who survived the trauma of Incarceration and their family members, those who lost their lives to state violence.",70,,
301,0.97,1807.906,1817.382,We come to this work with a lot of personal investment and experience and we offer these recommendations with a deep sense of urgency.,70,,
302,0.97,1817.382,1827.559,We start off by highlighting the principles of Community-Led solutions to give Councilmembers guidance on how to get through the budget cycle.,70,,
303,0.97,1827.559,1831.663,"When you're making budget decisions in the future, we ask you to follow these principles.",70,,
304,0.97,1831.663,1839.237,One of our principles is to reclaim the use of definitions of key terms that are used in the criminal legal system.,70,,
305,0.97,1839.237,1848.146,"Superficial changes and ongoing harm in our communities, other criminal legal system, is justified by distortion of these Terminologies.",70,,
306,0.97,1848.146,1854.619,We want to highlight our definitions of these terms.,70,,
307,0.97,1854.619,1857.055,"Public safety, harm reduction, Trauma-Informed approach, accountability for harm.",70,,
308,0.97,1857.055,1866.13,I will pass it on to Dorian to share more.,70,,
309,0.97,1866.13,1867.599,& GT;,71,,
310,0.97,1867.599,1869.234,"Thank you, Sela.",72,,
311,0.97,1869.234,1883.481,"This is our definition of public safety, a state of physical, emotional, economic, and mental well-being and freedom from threat, coercion, and state violence.",72,,
312,0.97,1883.481,1885.45,A definition of safety Prioritizes safety.,72,,
313,0.97,1885.45,1889.988,Our definition of safety Prioritizes safety of people over property.,72,,
314,0.97,1889.988,1899.03,"We ask what safety means for black, indigenous, people of color, and poor people who are often targets of violence, especially by state institutions.",72,,
315,0.97,1899.03,1905.103,We emphasize the need for safety for people with disabilities and people experiencing mental health crisis.,72,,
316,0.97,1905.103,1916.648,"For people who are Houseless, for people who use drugs, for people who engage in sex work, the lack of a sense of safety for these communities are normalized.",72,,
317,0.97,1916.648,1920.184,And safety of these communities is often an Afterthought.,72,,
318,0.97,1920.184,1934.999,"We emphasize the need for safety for our youth, especially youth of color, who are impacted by the foster care system, cps, Seattle public schools, the Seattle police Department, and the court systems.",72,,
319,0.97,1934.999,1941.406,Jails are incredibly unsafe places where our communities experience violence and premature death.,72,,
320,0.97,1941.406,1951.215,The level of police killings against black and Brown people and people experiencing mental health crisis are known facts at this point.,72,,
321,0.97,1951.215,1958.79,We do not believe institutions can protect us.,72,,
322,0.97,1958.79,1962.16,I'll pass it to EMI.,72,,
323,0.97,1962.16,1962.293,.,72,,
324,0.97,1962.293,1962.927,"Thank you, Dorian.",73,,
325,0.97,1962.927,1968.132,One of the terms that we see is the [Indiscernible].,73,,
326,0.97,1968.132,1978.109,"It's something that's really talked about, but we need to talk about what it actually means and how that needs to focus on individual autonomy, justice, and human rights.",73,,
327,0.97,1978.109,1991.956,So harm reduction is a set of practices and policies that reduce negative health and social legal impact of drug use and other Stigmatized behaviors and Criminalized behaviors.,73,,
328,0.97,1991.956,1994.325,"Must be rooted in autonomy, justice, and human rights.",73,,
329,0.97,1994.325,1999.764,It has to focus on the goals and priorities as determined by the impacted individuals.,73,,
330,0.97,1999.764,2013.444,"If the goal is imposed on individuals such as stopping substance use, sex trade, and other Criminalized behavior as in many of the programs that the city has offered, it is not harm reduction.",73,,
331,0.97,2013.444,2025.523,"It needs to support people without judgment, coercion, discrimination, stigma, or the requirement that individuals commit to making specific changes as a precondition for support.",73,,
332,0.97,2025.523,2038.736,Harm reduction is not simply replacing Incarceration with other forms of state control over people's lives such as involuntary services under the threat of a criminal punishment.,73,,
333,0.97,2038.736,2053.317,"Harm reduction also is practically supporting and building up community infrastructure based on safety, relationship, and trust and must be guided by the principles and standards established by the community.",73,,
334,0.97,2053.317,2053.618,Next slide.,73,,
335,0.97,2053.618,2065.329,And another budget [Indiscernible] is trauma--again people talk about it without addressing how that critically impacts the going analysis.,74,,
336,0.97,2065.329,2070.401,So the approach assumes that nobody is inherently violent and abusive.,74,,
337,0.97,2070.401,2078.076,"We have all been traumatized by our surroundings, our community, our society, and learn to cope in whatever ways we could.",74,,
338,0.97,2078.076,2087.051,Some of these trauma responses have developed independence or behavior that are no longer helpful or may cause further harm to ourselves and others around us.,74,,
339,0.97,2087.051,2098.596,But being trauma informed means that we look at each person's struggles through a trauma lens which asks what has happened to you instead of what is wrong with you?,74,,
340,0.97,2098.596,2109.941,It is contrasted with a judgment or punitive model that considers harmful actions as failures of character that need to be corrected as punishment.,74,,
341,0.97,2109.941,2114.312,"Now, understanding each other's trauma does not mean that all actions are excused.",74,,
342,0.97,2114.312,2120.017,Individuals are still responsible for mending and redressing any Harms we have caused and addressing the Harms.,74,,
343,0.97,2120.017,2136.667,But we can do so without assigning judgment or moral blame and also while recognizing roles our society has created and played in not protecting and meeting the needs of the person who was caused harm.,74,,
344,0.97,2136.667,2141.772,And I'll send it off to David next.,74,,
345,0.97,2141.772,2143.441,"Thank you, EMI.",75,,
346,0.97,2143.441,2144.242,I really appreciate that.,75,,
347,0.97,2144.242,2150.982,The need for accountability is often used to justify the existence of the criminal legal system.,75,,
348,0.97,2150.982,2153.818,"We discuss accountability in a different way, though.",75,,
349,0.97,2153.818,2165.329,We feel accountability for behaviors that cause harm for three different levels with all of them sharing the goal of Humanizing all parties involved and addressing harm.,75,,
350,0.97,2165.329,2171.402,"We support accountability that promote positive change and responsibility, not those based on punishment and retribution.",75,,
351,0.97,2171.402,2178.543,We believe in a need to create spaces and conditions for meaningful accountability to take place.,75,,
352,0.97,2178.543,2185.683,On an individual level we support Community-Based solutions that develop an individual's capacity to recognize and take responsibility for harm they cause.,75,,
353,0.97,2185.683,2195.159,"On a community level we look at the role that the surrounding community may have played to ignore, minimize, and sometimes encourage harmful behaviors.",75,,
354,0.97,2195.159,2208.272,"On a societal level, we recognize the need to address root causes of harmful behaviors, systemic and harmful to society.",75,,
355,0.97,2208.272,2212.71,Also attending to the well-being and safety for survivors and people on the receiving end of harm.,75,,
356,0.97,2212.71,2226.19,"When it's all said and done, we really believe that accountability without relationship feelings like abuse and accountability with relationship feels like love.",75,,
357,0.97,2226.19,2226.724,Andy?,75,,
358,0.97,2226.724,2227.525,"Thank you, Dave.",76,,
359,0.97,2227.525,2227.892,Appreciate that.,76,,
360,0.97,2227.892,2242.139,"The criminal legal system, on the other hand, does not foster accountability but, in fact, it creates more harmful conditions, ScH as the criminal legal system disproportionately targets black and Brown communities and poor people.",76,,
361,0.97,2242.139,2251.349,"It does not address the root causes, including mental health crises, unsafe conditions for people who use drugs or poverty crimes.",76,,
362,0.97,2251.349,2258.489,Instead people are housed in jails and then released to their previous conditions.,76,,
363,0.97,2258.489,2277.508,"It Retraumatizes and causes more harm to people who are already in difficult circumstances through jail stays, legal fines, and fees police violence and Harassment and conviction histories.",76,,
364,0.97,2277.508,2289.987,"With this Reframing of key terms, we identify the following principles for developing Community-Led solutions to increase safety and reduce harm.",76,,
365,0.97,2289.987,2296.027,"Number one, divest the criminal legal system and invest in our communities.",76,,
366,0.97,2296.027,2304.468,"Number two, support community capacity to respond to Harms, independent of the criminal legal system and city role.",76,,
367,0.97,2304.468,2313.811,"Number three, provide resources and funding to community organizations to do preventive work.",76,,
368,0.97,2313.811,2315.646,"Four, Prioritize survivor support services and resources.",76,,
369,0.97,2315.646,2329.994,"I'm now going to pass it back to my good friend Liletha, to introduce our policy recommendations.",76,,
370,0.97,2329.994,2333.864,Are you on mute?,76,,
371,0.97,2333.864,2338.869,?,76,,
372,0.97,2338.869,2340.438,Where's Liletha?,77,,
373,0.97,2340.438,2341.138,Yes.,78,,
374,0.97,2341.138,2347.478,I believe Ms. Liletha is on mute.,78,,
375,0.97,2347.611,2349.347,Mute.,78,,
376,0.97,2349.347,2350.047,Sorry about that.,79,,
377,0.97,2350.047,2355.986,There are eight recommendations that we discussed in our report.,80,,
378,0.97,2355.986,2366.797,"In if recommendations one and two, we are calling on city and institutional players to take accountability for the ways they create the conditions and context where harm takes place.",80,,
379,0.97,2366.797,2380.644,"In recommendations three, four, and eight, we address specific trends within the criminal legal system which are couched as reforms such as the use of diversion programs, the use of electronic home monitoring, and the use of risk assessments.",80,,
380,0.97,2380.644,2388.486,"We point out that their limitations show how these approaches continue to survey, punish, and control our communities in other ways.",80,,
381,0.97,2388.486,2402.133,"We continue to call for a shrinking of the criminal legal system and believe that care, support, should replace Incarceration and control.",80,,
382,0.97,2402.133,2411.742,Bear with me here.,80,,
383,0.97,2411.742,2420.551,"In recommendations five, six, and seven, we discuss resources that can address organizations that foster accountability and are Life-Affirming.",80,,
384,0.97,2420.551,2433.798,"We're now going to discuss recommendations three and six in more detail, and let me pass it on to EMI to share more about recommendation three.",80,,
385,0.97,2433.798,2434.031,Emi.,81,,
386,0.97,2434.031,2435.866,"Thank you, Ms. Liletha.",82,,
387,0.97,2435.866,2436.066,Okay.,82,,
388,0.97,2436.066,2436.267,Great.,82,,
389,0.97,2436.267,2446.71,"So diversion is often talked about as an alternative to criminal legal system, as [Indiscernible] did.",82,,
390,0.97,2446.71,2453.417,"But diversion is a part of the criminal legal system, not an alternative to it.",82,,
391,0.97,2453.417,2457.288,It relies on discretionary power of law enforcement and threat of punishment.,82,,
392,0.97,2457.288,2468.165,"The goal of diversion is reducing crimes, which is fine on its own right, but it is Inpatible with reduction support.",82,,
393,0.97,2468.165,2474.038,Criminal legal system is not a good way to deliver services to our community needs.,82,,
394,0.97,2474.038,2492.957,"People have been harmed by the large number of service providers that avail themselves to the criminal legal system and monitoring participation and, quote, progress, of the criminal legal system, including the cps.",82,,
395,0.97,2492.957,2508.339,"That said, and we know that divergence still happens, so we want to make suggestions to make it better or less harmful, and so the funding for diversion program should not be new money.",82,,
396,0.97,2508.339,2521.352,"It should be reallocated from existing money to diversion so that we're not growing the criminal legal system or widening its net, and it must minimize coercion to keep it voluntary as much as possible.",82,,
397,0.97,2521.352,2528.225,It needs to reduce the law enforcement discretion and monitor the use of that power.,82,,
398,0.97,2528.225,2539.27,It must guarantee the participants trial rights so whether you succeed or not succeed in the diversion program would not have any impact on the right to receive fair trial.,82,,
399,0.97,2539.27,2549.78,"It should take place early in the stage, in the Prefiling, Prearrest, or earlier.",82,,
400,0.97,2549.78,2563.928,"Divergence service providers must have a genuine relationship with the community and be controlled by the communities they serve, and it should never be a primary way to deliver a service and support the people who need them.",82,,
401,0.97,2563.928,2570.901,And now I'd like to pass on to Dorian to talk about recommendation no.,82,,
402,0.97,2570.901,2571.101,6.,82,,
403,0.97,2571.101,2573.103,"Thank you, EMI.",83,,
404,0.97,2573.103,2588.686,"So people with disabilities have consistently fought against the ways in which people, the medical system in conjunction with the criminal legal system have erased our bodily autonomy and subjected us to medical, physical, sexual, and other forms of violence.",83,,
405,0.97,2588.686,2597.728,"In the criminal legal system, this includes the use of medical treatment as a prerequisite for release or criteria to mitigate a sentence.",83,,
406,0.97,2597.728,2605.235,"We call on the city to learn from the disability justice movement, its history, and its organizing demand.",83,,
407,0.97,2605.235,2614.111,These are some of the ways in which the city can support the well-being of people with disabilities.,83,,
408,0.97,2614.111,2621.285,Acknowledge that coercive mental health treatment through the criminal legal system causes stigma and Traumatizes people with disabilities.,83,,
409,0.97,2621.285,2654.418,"This makes seeking care further down the road, down the road from the Traumatizing and [Indiscernible] advocate for resource and community care options that uphold the autonomy of people with disabilities and/or harm reductions, work with unions and/or Healthcare workers to ensure good working conditions of community health facilities in part because the staffing ratio of these facilities have impact on the quality of care that people with disabilities experience.",83,,
410,0.97,2654.418,2662.393,I'll pass it to David.,83,,
411,0.97,2662.393,2663.394,I appreciate that.,84,,
412,0.97,2663.394,2669.6,We are the community members who are deeply engaged in organizing for change within our community.,84,,
413,0.97,2669.6,2676.14,We come together here so institutional Stakeholders can understand what is common knowledge in our space.,84,,
414,0.97,2676.14,2681.045,Thank you for allocating the resources.,84,,
415,0.97,2681.045,2687.451,You can access our full support with the link.,84,,
416,0.97,2687.451,2701.799,"While community engagement efforts by Stakeholders and policymakers have traditionally been even Exploitive, we hope to shift out of those harmful patterns with the work of our task force and we hope you will support this.",84,,
417,0.97,2701.799,2709.94,We urge you to consider our principles and values as you work through the budget season and we look forward to working with the community partners as well that share the same vision and practice.,84,,
418,0.97,2709.94,2716.146,Thank you for your time and I really appreciate you for making space for our voices.,84,,
419,0.97,2716.146,2717.114,Thank you.,84,,
420,0.97,2717.114,2720.918,Thank you so much.,85,,
421,0.97,2720.918,2724.421,That was a very powerful presentation.,85,,
422,0.97,2724.421,2734.832,I really appreciate the time and effort and energy and love that went into the development of these recommendations.,85,,
423,0.97,2734.832,2741.839,Want to see whether or not my colleagues have any questions or comments.,85,,
424,0.97,2741.839,2756.587,"Looking to see if there's any hands raised from Councilmembers, either virtually or in real life.",85,,
425,0.97,2756.587,2760.057,I've got Councilmember Morales.,85,,
426,0.97,2760.057,2760.39,Yes.,85,,
427,0.97,2760.39,2761.558,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",86,,
428,0.97,2761.558,2765.262,First I do want to give all of you my appreciation for being here.,86,,
429,0.97,2765.262,2768.532,I think it's really important work that you're engaging in.,86,,
430,0.97,2768.532,2804.434,"It's crucial for us as policymakers to be hearing directly from folks who are most impacted by the policies that we're considering, by the budgets that we're considering, and so I just want to honor all of the work that you've been doing and honestly, like as a representative of the city that has, you know, for generations been caused this harm in our city, I want to say I'm sorry and I'm eager to work with you to move us in the right direction.",86,,
431,0.97,2804.434,2811.942,I do have a question about one of your recommendations.,86,,
432,0.97,2811.942,2812.743,Recommendation no.,86,,
433,0.97,2812.743,2851.515,"8 talks about not relying on Data-Driven solutions and, you know, not kind of centering that in if the ways that we make decisions and I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about that because very often in this institution especially, we do talk about how we are going to measure the success of a program, measure the effectiveness of dollars that we spend, and so I would love to hear a little bit from you all about what you think is the problem with that and what you think an appropriate alternative would be.",86,,
434,0.97,2851.515,2853.483,"Can I go, David?",87,,
435,0.97,2853.483,2862.893,"So I think, like, in the report what we're talking about is mainly the data that's been used to assess people, individuals in the criminal legal system.",87,,
436,0.97,2862.893,2871.702,"So we're not talking about the data for evaluating the, like, overall program success.",87,,
437,0.97,2871.702,2871.902,Right?,87,,
438,0.97,2871.902,2892.489,"We are focusing on ways that I think the data is being introduced to make things more efficient and also make it more fair because, like, individual police, judges, prosecutors may have, like, biases and they use data to decide who do you prosecute, who do you offer diversion to, who do you release to the public, et cetera.",87,,
439,0.97,2892.489,2897.294,The idea is that it will make them better.,87,,
440,0.97,2897.294,2901.064,But it's based on data that's already tainted by the biases.,87,,
441,0.97,2901.064,2924.321,"So if you base the possibility somebody might Reoffend as a basis for determining probation conditions, who to release or who to give lighter sentences to and that data is already tainted because that's based on who got arrested and prosecuted in the past, and it's already reflective of racial and other biases.",87,,
442,0.97,2924.321,2938.535,"So in--even though we're trying to remove the element of bias, the bias is actually built into those assessment tools, and how that--we're just making it more invisible.",87,,
443,0.97,2938.535,2957.387,"You know, before individuals can be held accountable when they do something like egregious, and yet now it's like impartial that has nothing--ours doesn't have bias but it actually does because of the data that goes into creating those.",87,,
444,0.97,2957.387,2969.399,At the minimum there has to be transparency about what rules are being used and that rules out most of the commercial and outward providers because their process is not transparent.,87,,
445,0.97,2969.399,2970.534,They don't tell you.,87,,
446,0.97,2970.534,2974.404,They don't tell our elected leaders what it's actually doing.,87,,
447,0.97,2974.404,2974.638,Right?,87,,
448,0.97,2974.638,2983.814,"And then when we have a transparency that we need to monitor it to make sure that it's not--you know, reintroducing bias into the evaluation.",87,,
449,0.97,2983.814,2994.524,"So that's largely--largely, that's what we're looking at and not necessarily, like, looking at the data for overall, you know, the systems.",87,,
450,0.97,2994.524,2995.092,Right?,87,,
451,0.97,2995.092,2995.359,Uh-huh.,88,,
452,0.97,2995.359,2995.826,That's very helpful.,88,,
453,0.97,2995.826,2996.927,Thank you so much.,88,,
454,0.97,2996.927,3002.165,"Yeah, thank you so much, EMI.",89,,
455,0.97,3002.165,3024.621,"That was very, I think, illuminating of some of the very robust discussion prior to Carlos's report focused on the reliance on the risk model, Rrm, I'm forgetting the other work.",89,,
456,0.97,3024.621,3044.074,"Responsivity model, risk Responsivity model, the reliance on that to identify who should have access to services rather than really focusing on what people's strengths are and how to support folks in their--in addressing threats to people's strengths.",89,,
457,0.97,3044.074,3057.788,And really appreciate lifting that up as we look at the design of programs that we are creating harm.,89,,
458,0.97,3057.788,3083.547,"Appreciate the reminder of the fact that that is a term that is sometimes misused, misused as well as programs that are really truly according to the actual principles of Trauma-Informed care really meeting those high standards of where we want to go in our program development.",89,,
459,0.97,3083.547,3090.287,Looking to see if we have other comments or questions?,89,,
460,0.97,3090.287,3150.38,"And not seeing any other hands up, this is--there's no accident that this is a presentation that we're hearing before we enter the budget process, talking about the next steps, I think it's going to be really important, Council, to consider and apply the task force recommendations to the programs that we consider as we work to, again, reduce act often the strengths they have and support them in doing so.",89,,
461,0.97,3150.38,3167.697,I really want to have some of the words of thanks and acknowledgement from the task force full report and the work new youth jail movement.,89,,
462,0.97,3167.697,3168.498,And others that proceeded work.,89,,
463,0.97,3168.498,3177.807,"Those are--we acknowledge and honor the incredible courage, labor and contributions of our committee members.",89,,
464,0.97,3177.807,3179.209,Movement builders to pave the way.,89,,
465,0.97,3179.209,3186.049,The particular work with in the task force possible through various campaigns and initiative its over the years.,89,,
466,0.97,3186.049,3191.121,In fact it is work of those groups.,89,,
467,0.97,3200.03,3203.9,To this place we are in today.,89,,
468,0.97,3203.9,3228.091,"I know these voices will continue to drive us to a better place that more reflects the kind of city that I know I want to live in and I know others need to be able to live in so, with that again, thank you so much for being with us here today and all of your work.",89,,
469,0.97,3229.159,3234.731,Will the clerk read in agenda item number 2.,89,,

486,0.97,3327.991,3333.229,I touched about on this ahead of the agenda.,96,,
487,0.97,3333.229,3338.735,Back in 2019 the council passed resolution 31916.,96,,
488,0.97,3338.735,3361.691,"That resolution we acknowledged the city's responsibility to reduce unnecessary and involvement and declared our commitment to ensuring that law enforcement Prearrest diversion programs such as lead receive funding, sufficient to accept all priority referrals by 2023.",96,,
489,0.97,3361.691,3376.84,"Today Representists from lead, human services Department and central staff are here to present on the number of referrals that may be expected in the funding that would be required to expand Prearrest version except the referrals.",96,,
490,0.97,3376.84,3385.648,This analysis was required by a statement of legislative event that I sponsored and was adopted by the watch fall.,96,,
491,0.97,3385.648,3388.051,Recording stopped.,97,,
492,0.97,3388.051,3391.221,Better pause.,98,,
493,0.97,3398.762,3400.196,Recording in progress.,98,,
494,0.97,3400.196,3417.68,The analysis is especially important for Council to have as we move in to the budget season and consider how best to allocate resources to secure our community safety.,99,,
495,0.97,3417.68,3444.541,Again think one important point to make especially in light of hearing from our previous Presenters is that there was change recently as it relates to the police Department's involvement or necessary involvement in doing community referrals.,99,,
496,0.97,3444.541,3459.856,There has been a delinking of that as being a part of the lead program and I'm sure some point we don't need to address that at the top but it would be great if that is woven in to the presentation.,99,,
497,0.97,3459.856,3462.826,I believe--I saw it mentioned in the central staff memo it.,99,,
498,0.97,3462.826,3470.099,Would be good to address that a little bit as we get in to the presentation.,99,,
499,0.97,3470.099,3473.87,"With that, I will hand it off to the present ears.",99,,
500,0.97,3473.87,3475.672,I think you will start us off?,99,,

506,0.97,3483.379,3483.78,Don't worry.,103,,
507,0.97,3483.78,3489.052,I knew I would get a chance to introduce myself.,103,,
508,0.97,3489.052,3489.319,No Biggi.,103,,
509,0.97,3489.319,3496.492,Thank you for the opportunity to be here and give me an opportunity to speak today.,103,,
510,0.97,3496.492,3503.099,My remarks will be very brief because the PDA is the subject matter expert at the table today.,103,,
511,0.97,3503.099,3525.722,Again as you said the 2021 budget included the statement of legislative intent and that requested the Hsd provide a report to Council to determine the funding to allow the Prearrest diversion programs to accept all qualifying referrals.,103,,
512,0.97,3525.722,3530.827,His staff worked the PDA and lead to prepare the report this summer.,103,,
513,0.97,3530.827,3535.164,As directed in the slide.,103,,
514,0.97,3535.164,3547.243,Hsd coordinated that work and then upon receipt of the report we submitted to the public safety and human services committee and the central staff on August 4TH of this year.,103,,
515,0.97,3547.243,3557.153,The substance and the analysis included in the slide response reflects the work of the lead policy coordinating group.,103,,
516,0.97,3557.153,3572.201,"Just touch on the current and past budget for lead and the PDA in general for its programs, the 2021 budget invested $6.2 million in lead.",103,,
517,0.97,3572.201,3591.821,"In June 2021, ordinance 126, it 98 lead the--by the Council appropriated another three million to lead and then recently also through that same ordinance Council also appropriated funding for Noncon Gegrate shelter.",103,,
518,0.97,3591.821,3601.965,Of those 5.5 million is being funded to another PDA program just care for 89 hotel based shelter units.,103,,
519,0.97,3601.965,3614.677,Finally I want to note that Hsd is transferring the management of the lead contract from the homelessness division which we know sun selling at the end of 2021.,103,,
520,0.97,3614.677,3619.849,Its going to the new safe and thriving community division.,103,,
521,0.97,3619.849,3628.257,It's a better match because the mission of lead is a lined the goal of increasing community safety.,103,,
522,0.97,3628.257,3654.917,"So, one thing that we would suggest is that discussions related to evaluation and--cost analysis impact analysis of lead be conducted in 2022 because that would then allow the safe and thriving division to ensure alignment of lead and other responses to criminal justice that we are working on.",103,,
523,0.97,3654.917,3668.798,"So with that as I mentioned very short period of time, very sport presentation and that concludes it.",103,,
524,0.97,3668.798,3685.214,"So, I don't know who is leading the discussions so I--I just hand it over to you and you can organize yourself to speak up according to who is going to speak first.",104,,
525,0.97,3685.214,3685.648,Yes.,105,,
526,0.97,3685.648,3685.882,Again.,105,,
527,0.97,3685.882,3696.292,I just first want to really thank the chair for this entire session today.,105,,
528,0.97,3696.292,3702.832,As me and especially my fellow thought partner in this who could not be here today.,105,,
529,0.97,3702.832,3725.421,"Brandy flood have been really concerned as this have been conversations around and really important conversations around crisis alternative responses, alternatives to 911, noncriminal police responses, and solutions for that black and Brown folks would be left out as the result and further impacted by the criminal legal system that.",105,,
530,0.97,3725.421,3744.407,"Is a result that we know that block and Brown folks are going to be seen as committing crimes, seen less as in crisis, and more as a public threat and a public danger and still committing crimes or allegedly seen as committing crimes.",105,,
531,0.97,3744.407,3753.082,"So, I really appreciate the presentation that was said before as we think about people perceived as committing crimes or actually committing crimes.",105,,
532,0.97,3753.082,3769.298,Our goal in this program has been and will always be focusing on public health and public safety for our members of our community which includes our clients and people own businesses and are housed.,105,,
533,0.97,3769.298,3781.611,Thank you again for this panel and thinking about this so complete a was he think about better ways to do things moving forward and take lessons learn from how we have done things in the past.,105,,
534,0.97,3781.611,3789.819,From that I will--throw out the sly deck here.,105,,
535,0.97,3789.819,3791.454,Give me one second.,105,,
536,0.97,3800.163,3803.199,So this is me and brandy flood who I said cannot be here.,105,,
537,0.97,3803.199,3809.839,We have the honor of Devon joins and we will be speaking on behalf of reach.,105,,
538,0.97,3809.839,3822.518,"Since its been a while since lead has presented to that Council I thought it would be good to round and touch base, lead has let everybody advance with dignity it.",105,,
539,0.97,3822.518,3830.493,Provides community based care for people who commit law violations or extreme poverty as an alternative.,105,,
540,0.97,3830.493,3846.008,What we are really focusing on is reducing the policing of these individuals we have always had a core value of stop the harm that is being caused by these individuals and to these individuals but we don't just leave folks out there.,105,,
541,0.97,3846.008,3853.249,We want to do wrap around supportive individual based care for those individuals.,105,,
542,0.97,3853.249,3861.524,The case management follows the harm reduction principle as well and Devon will talk later around that.,105,,
543,0.97,3861.524,3885.314,"Councilmember you did ask and this I think bar chart really explains the evolution of lead as we have really moved from law enforcement based diversion and social context and as you will see through the past year, community requested and Council responded to when you allowing to lift the gate keeping of law enforcement and have community based referrals.",105,,
544,0.97,3885.314,3902.798,"Those are referrals where we know there's concern or actual public health, public safety concerns with individuals and we through PDA not through law enforcement are approving those individuals with deep consultation with reach.",105,,
545,0.97,3902.798,3905.935,We will talk about that a little later.,105,,
546,0.97,3905.935,3930.159,"As you can see in 2019 the Red is arrest diversions, referrals that law enforcement had to approve and starting in July through September of 2020, community referrals came Online and as you move to 2021, you can really see that is the majority of the referrals that we get to this day.",105,,
547,0.97,3930.159,3943.406,It has impacted our program as a whole and how we enter the work and supporting the community as a whole in terms of their concerns of public health and public safety.,105,,
548,0.97,3943.406,3948.411,With that in--just really detailing how command referrals come in.,105,,
549,0.97,3948.411,3961.791,How conversations with in community around public safety and leads are--occur I really want to pass it over to Tierra who has been doing a lot of great work in this past year.,105,,

551,0.97,3962.892,3980.176,Since the council passed the ability to receive the internally that community based referrals we have spent time engaging community members who come in contact with the individuals we serve and who experience situations for which lead is an appropriate response.,106,,
552,0.97,3980.176,3988.551,"This has included local businesses, first responders, Coble service providers be public health and community members.",106,,
553,0.97,3988.551,3994.523,These referrals are Vetted internally in collaboration with the project management team and service provider.,106,,
554,0.97,3994.523,4000.93,"Including black, and other people of color with lived experience similar to that of those in lead bottle care.",106,,
555,0.97,4000.93,4011.874,"Many of those who are referred to as individuals engaging in low level law violation there's are driven by poverty, substance use and behavioral health needs.",106,,
556,0.97,4011.874,4033.095,"When Vetting individuals for lead we have priorities using a racial equity lens looking for individual who have been impacted by the criminal legal system, often times long history of impacted by the war on drugs, individuals who have been left out of other services and who continue to face high barriers to Accessing other services with in the community.",106,,
557,0.97,4033.095,4041.37,We also have priorities for those who are impacted to the surrounding community and in risk of coming in contact with law enforcement.,106,,
558,0.97,4041.37,4047.343,Just a couple of examples of situations we have been asked to respond to.,106,,
559,0.97,4047.343,4054.583,There is a man of color living in China town International district who experiences very high behavioral health needs.,106,,
560,0.97,4054.583,4060.89,He has a history of being arrested and jailed only to continue to be found not competent in court.,106,,
561,0.97,4060.89,4066.896,This is also somebody who is disrupting those trying to live in China town International district.,106,,
562,0.97,4066.896,4069.765,Our team is actively working to engage with him.,106,,
563,0.97,4069.765,4077.473,Address his unmet needs and continue to provide services that can reduce his impact on the community and the policing of him.,106,,
564,0.97,4077.473,4082.077,Jail has not worked to address this need and will not work.,106,,
565,0.97,4082.077,4089.819,We receive the call about a woman continuing to disrupt a business in Pioneer square.,106,,
566,0.97,4089.819,4100.429,"We responded continued to engage with her and developed a plan to address her unmet need and relieve the impact to the business, patrons and those living outside near the business.",106,,
567,0.97,4100.429,4104.834,We continue to receive requests to respond to public safety needs.,106,,
568,0.97,4104.834,4109.572,"We have been asked to respond to queen Ann, motel and have Startd that outreach.",106,,
569,0.97,4109.572,4117.213,We have been if long time contact with the Mount Baker community that has an unmet need for these services.,106,,
570,0.97,4117.213,4123.118,"However, we are facing serious capacity issues at this time and cannot keep up with the increasing requests.",106,,
571,0.97,4123.118,4139.101,I want to pass along to Devon from reach who can talk about some of the work that we are doing and some of the work that they have recently done.,106,,
572,0.97,4141.203,4141.704,Thank you.,107,,
573,0.97,4141.704,4146.342,As I said earlier my name is Devon.,107,,
574,0.97,4146.342,4151.38,I'm the program manager for the lead program at reach.,107,,
575,0.97,4151.38,4153.082,The clinical service arm of lead.,107,,
576,0.97,4153.082,4160.556,I have been on this team at reach for seven years and I'm really proud to see how this program has changed.,107,,
577,0.97,4160.556,4163.259,Overtime to continue to meet the needs of the community.,107,,
578,0.97,4163.259,4172.067,As you can see here we have a graph around the approved community referrals by racial Demographica.,107,,
579,0.97,4172.067,4175.571,We are happy to answer more questions about that.,107,,
580,0.97,4175.571,4193.522,The community referral process has been a great opportunity for us to have priorities for people who we see at really at the most margins of what is considered like safe and unsafe in our community and our city.,107,,
581,0.97,4193.522,4207.102,"We have priorities for individuals who have failed out of our traditional behavioral health system, our traditional substance use system, who have experienced significant harm from years of involvement in the criminal justice sits temperature.",107,,
582,0.97,4207.102,4222.084,"We have priorities for people who have been impacted by trauma of the war on drugs, war on communities of color in this city and county and on Profundly low income communities.",107,,
583,0.97,4222.084,4228.023,Lead has priorities for those individuals who the system has seen as violent.,107,,
584,0.97,4228.023,4253.749,This is of particular importance when we look at just the embedded RAC Isp in history with in the criminal justice system so when we do the community referral process one of the things we look at we have priorities individuals with extensive criminal histories including violent criminal histories that would preclude them from Accessing other programs.,107,,
585,0.97,4253.749,4278.14,"So that's just something I really want to be transparent about is like that is who we want to serve is folks who have been seen as criminal, seen as violent because of their unmet behavioral health need and the way the system has failed them.",107,,
586,0.97,4279.842,4280.142,Okay.,107,,
587,0.97,4280.142,4280.442,Go for it.,107,,
588,0.97,4280.442,4283.712,I was going to say thank you Devon.,108,,
589,0.97,4283.712,4288.017,Before we kind of talk about that just paints a really good picture of who the clients are.,108,,
590,0.97,4288.017,4304.433,"Whether we do the community referral process we are combining priorities that Devon has name there's with the high impact, high priority individuals and community members are concerned about in terms of that public health, public safety realm.",108,,
591,0.97,4304.433,4306.068,That feedback they are getting.,108,,
592,0.97,4306.068,4318.213,With that Devonly hand it back to you so you can talk about what these clients kind of--the service look like.,108,,
593,0.97,4318.213,4318.514,Absolutely.,108,,
594,0.97,4318.514,4325.487,We do provide a long term intensive individual service package at the reach program.,108,,
595,0.97,4325.487,4331.226,Our work is all client centered.,108,,
596,0.97,4331.226,4339.468,There is no compliance--based and the work is designed between the relationship of a case manager and not assigned participant.,108,,
597,0.97,4339.468,4352.347,"Here we have the number of--we have one of our case managers, Kimberly featured in this image and then the director of outreach featured in this image this was taken at the ever spring hotel.",108,,
598,0.97,4352.347,4366.161,We were the primary service provider to respond to the ever spring hotel population at the time of closure last summer and have continued to work with that community very closely for the last year.,108,,
599,0.97,4366.161,4381.21,"It's one thing, one example that I would share of kind of who is a lead client is an individual who came from profound inter generational trauma, grew newspaper the foster care system.",108,,
600,0.97,4381.21,4384.48,"Black woman, 50 years old.",108,,
601,0.97,4384.48,4391.053,Gender Nonconforming always seen as causing a problem or causing a risk to public safety.,108,,
602,0.97,4391.053,4397.092,"Always Sen as criminal, really, really long history with the criminal justice system.",108,,
603,0.97,4397.092,4409.004,"This individual was not referred to lead until she was in her 50's meaning she faced many, many prison sentences for nonviolent crimes in our state.",108,,
604,0.97,4409.004,4418.58,Many jail and was referred through the direct program over ten times and was not successful so these are the kind of folks that lead is designed to serve.,108,,
605,0.97,4418.58,4423.585,This is the kind of person we specialize in.,108,,
606,0.97,4423.585,4429.558,Particularly reflecting on many of the individuals we encountered at ever spring hotel.,108,,
607,0.97,4429.558,4440.502,"I'm thinking about lots and lots of older, single black men who have spent much of their life in our criminal justice system.",108,,
608,0.97,4440.502,4443.605,This Reseen as part of criminal involvement.,108,,
609,0.97,4443.605,4448.477,Seen as too high functioning to access our traditional behavioral health services.,108,,
610,0.97,4448.477,4459.888,So have never been offered anything by our homeless service system our behavioral health system and are really struggling to meet Unmeet behavioral Healthneeds.,108,,
611,0.97,4459.888,4464.092,These are just some of the examples of folk that we are cone Utters through the work.,108,,
612,0.97,4464.092,4473.735,"Here we have some images of some of our case managers and supervisors who are really the heart of our team, we are an outreach based model.",108,,
613,0.97,4473.735,4475.971,We do not spend our days in an office.,108,,
614,0.97,4475.971,4489.251,You can see some of everybody in this image still works at the reach program and I'm so proud to have them on our team and working in the community.,108,,
615,0.97,4489.251,4492.321,Thank you so much.,109,,
616,0.97,4492.321,4495.324,Can you--touch upon the information in the box.,109,,
617,0.97,4495.324,4501.029,I think it's important to lift up.,109,,
618,0.97,4501.029,4501.396,Absolutely.,110,,
619,0.97,4501.396,4502.197,Thank you Councilmember.,110,,
620,0.97,4502.197,4515.611,One of the pieces of our model at the lead program that we feel is super special is we keep case loads small so that he with can get to know folks really well and build an individual service plan with them.,110,,
621,0.97,4515.611,4531.059,We did in 2019 work with the city Council to establish a requirement that average case loads be no more than 20 case was a maximum of 25 active clients so we can provide that really intensive case management.,110,,
622,0.97,4531.059,4539.768,This is in comparison to thinking about like a traditional Medicaid funded Úbehavioral health program.,110,,
623,0.97,4539.768,4545.44,Case loads would be between 100 and 150 individuals per counselor.,110,,
624,0.97,4545.44,4558.987,"Just noting this is part of our service package and part of the reason why we are able to work with people you know for upwards of 15, 20, 30 hours a month sometimes for those clients that were working closely with.",110,,
625,0.97,4558.987,4578.974,In the other thing I would add is that--one thing about the reach program and our hiring practices that's important for me to note is that we have focus on hiring individuals with lived experience and we do not require advanced degrees in order to be able to seven on our team at lead.,110,,
626,0.97,4578.974,4595.324,"Many of our case Manageerns come with profound lived experience in the legal system, lived experience in the substance abuse and the sex trade, of profound generational poverty and it's part of what motivates them to come to this work.",110,,
627,0.97,4595.324,4603.298,"It's really an honor to work with this team and not see a lot of the traditional barriers, it's requiring a lot of advanced degrees to work with this community.",110,,
628,0.97,4603.298,4604.533,Thank you.,111,,
629,0.97,4604.533,4614.943,I just would add when counsel Irhears us talk about at capacity we are talking at we aren't able to honor the case loads that we are trying to have here.,111,,
630,0.97,4614.943,4617.579,"Often moving to 30, 35 cases.",111,,
631,0.97,4617.579,4625.454,S a result even in the community referrals one of the agreements is we would do them as capacity allows and right now capacity does not allow that.,111,,
632,0.97,4625.454,4639.868,"The majority of our referrals even if it meets all the criteria that he with have described and focusing on high priority high needs, Trueblood individuals, we are still denying those because our case loads are too high.",111,,
633,0.97,4639.868,4644.306,Our case Mackerns we know won't be able to go outreach individuals until they find them.,111,,
634,0.97,4644.306,4666.395,"They will only pick up the phone, they won't be able to go and work for different criminal--system results for that client giving them the full options of that so, there is just so much that Harms the client and the case managers about to be successful if our case loads get too high.",111,,
635,0.97,4666.395,4676.304,For the commitment that we already have to those individuals and the community as a whole we stopped accepting referrals even if we do think that they could benefit from our work.,111,,
636,0.97,4676.304,4680.208,"When we say at capacity, we are talking about our case loads are being too high.",111,,
637,0.97,4680.208,4688.05,That is part of the reason why I wanted to focus on our case manager structure and our clients.,111,,
638,0.97,4688.05,4705.934,When we talk about bringing lead to scale are you talking about further funding for case managers to keep appropriate case loads and for us to be responsive to all the high priority lead eligible individuals that are out there that are looking for those type of support.,111,,
639,0.97,4705.934,4722.184,"So I will quickly run down the current numbers of our funding which you can see here with the city of Seattle funding, went through this, Hsd funding, King County Midopportunitying and Trueblood funding it.",111,,
640,0.97,4722.184,4733.228,Will be noted that it's at 3 million--was set aside for we have yet to receive that funding but Nope think that's coming through soon.,111,,
641,0.97,4733.228,4744.606,"When we are talking about as I just said, funding for lead as you will see the two green ties are the direct service programming, and its client based costs.",111,,
642,0.97,4744.606,4747.542,The other Thicks really pulled out here as well.,111,,
643,0.97,4747.542,4760.822,My team and the lead project team is that 4% red slice you that see right there to do the community coordination around all the different recommends that we are managing.,111,,
644,0.97,4761.59,4779.174,When we were thinking about bringing lead to scale and supporting answering that question we were trying to determine how many lead eligible individuals are there in the community and we kind of went through this a few different ways.,112,,
645,0.97,4779.174,4784.613,My team did extensive conversations with I would say high level referrals from the community themselves.,112,,
646,0.97,4784.613,4796.358,"If you--if the lead could take everybody that was a public health, public safety concern, how many people do you estimate that you would have, we did that with the criminal legal system.",112,,
647,0.97,4796.358,4809.538,"We did that in a--a few different ways and then we really wanted to make sure that we were conservative in our estimates so we reduced numbers based on duplication, not good match.",112,,
648,0.97,4809.538,4815.377,People who by experience in the past may not complete their intake or not--assigned a case manager.,112,,
649,0.97,4815.377,4837.465,"Really just trying to be as complete with the partners relationships and communities that we could in terms of determining how many people would be referred to lead because one thing that I did not point out a few slides ago I will go back quickly is when you look at our slides in January through March, that number is much higher and that was when we were approving all high priority referrals.",112,,
650,0.97,4837.465,4845.907,Very early on this year we realized we would be quickly over loading our case Manageerns and started aggressively saying no even to eligible people.,112,,
651,0.97,4845.907,4855.951,"So when you see April and June and July and August, that is my attempt to say no to individuals which I am trying to get a bet are better job at.",112,,
652,0.97,4855.951,4871.933,"As someone that's been doing harm reduction and public safety, homeless services--it breaks my heart to not be able to provide those services for people interested in doing so.",112,,
653,0.97,4879.608,4881.977,I will hand this over to list a.,112,,
654,0.97,4881.977,4912.274,"Very quickly, just to acknowledge that lead was born a decade ago and in planning over a decade ago out of a widely felt hope that a belief felt by many that could and should be possible to respond to many if not most community safety and public offered issues through community based care rather than the criminal legal system.",113,,
655,0.97,4912.274,4926.288,"That was an idea that had a lot--had wide author ship and has had a lot of proponents over the years, some of whom are still on this team here with you today.",113,,
656,0.97,4926.288,4929.824,Others who are doing amazing work elsewhere.,113,,
657,0.97,4929.824,4930.892,The thing is that idea worked.,113,,
658,0.97,4930.892,4933.161,That idea proved to be true.,113,,
659,0.97,4933.161,4949.11,There has been the community of Seattle from early days has proven that it is willing to support and accept these kind of responses.,113,,
660,0.97,4949.11,4951.446,"Instead of arrest, Jl prosecution.",113,,
661,0.97,4951.446,4959.354,The ability to provide them has rarely if ever kept up with demand.,113,,
662,0.97,4959.354,4966.361,Pro--reflects just and many have been witnesses to us over the years.,113,,
663,0.97,4966.361,4974.636,As repeated of when people would--who in the past may have thought that what they wanted as enforcement when they learned there was this alternative.,113,,
664,0.97,4974.636,4977.005,They asked for it.,113,,
665,0.97,4977.005,4997.859,That and that pushed expansion or calls for expansion but also just in terms of the volumes of individuals who when people in the community started to think maybe a better response would be lead and the resources available to provide that case management response instead of punishment have never kept one that demand.,113,,
666,0.97,4997.859,5004.766,This growth shows that you have responded to repeated illustration.,113,,
667,0.97,5013.575,5015.543,A fairly steady growth arc.,113,,
668,0.97,5015.543,5025.82,"And yet, we are clearly not upscale and that's where the 2019 resolution came from was sort of really fighting at the level of policy.",113,,
669,0.97,5025.82,5068.696,"The need to figure out if this is popular, widely supported in the right thing to do, essentially what is the scale of resources that would be needed to meet that demand in all priority cases and this led to this slide and this current conversation, we have projected here, you can see the 2022S2023, this is an exercise we have done base based on a number of ideas and I will--they have been really thoughtfully I think analyzed by the premiere staff.",113,,
670,0.97,5068.696,5076.805,Ly defer this discussion of that to Jeff's comments.,113,,
671,0.97,5083.545,5084.779,Thank you so much.,114,,
672,0.97,5084.779,5102.964,"Just this is another way of breaking down and looking behind that a little bit to know, to see what I had stated before that when it's increasing costs are really focused on direct programming and client services with administrative impact as well.",114,,
673,0.97,5102.964,5113.775,"So, with that I do want to make sure that Jeff has time so if there are any questions we continue now or we can wait until after Jeff's presentation.",114,,
674,0.97,5123.151,5125.787,We can just continue to hold the questions.,114,,
675,0.97,5127.989,5128.223,Great.,114,,
676,0.97,5128.223,5128.656,Thank you so much.,114,,
677,0.97,5128.656,5132.56,"Jeff, let's turn it over to you.",114,,
678,0.97,5141.202,5150.478,"I think I have ability to, let me try that.",115,,
679,0.97,5156.718,5164.259,Are you able to see the slide okay?,115,,
680,0.97,5164.259,5164.492,Great.,115,,
681,0.97,5164.492,5179.474,"So, others--just noted I have probably spent--had a lot of cooperation with both her and--at PDA over the last week or two in trying to analyze a lot of the assumptions.",115,,
682,0.97,5179.474,5185.413,There's a lot of them as Terra presented on that go into estimates and what the slide asked for.,115,,
683,0.97,5185.413,5194.022,What the case load for lead would look like if if were to be serving city wide all of the qualified priority referrals.,115,,
684,0.97,5195.557,5198.026,Then the associated cost with that.,115,,
685,0.97,5198.026,5206.668,What I have for surrender basically a couple different--a slightly different way of looking at what is--Iowa in soft the slides.,115,,
686,0.97,5209.17,5217.378,Thel side blue line that often gets covered up by a green with you is what is presented in the slide response.,115,,
687,0.97,5217.378,5228.723,"It's from--2022, the case load is projected to increase if more funding were provided for lead to move to scale city wide.",115,,
688,0.97,5228.723,5233.828,Was identified through a survey with partners as PDA already mentioned.,115,,
689,0.97,5233.828,5239.901,That--discuss fire Department you--we have the capacity to serve your clients how many would you send to us?,115,,
690,0.97,5239.901,5248.243,"So you see that kind of rises until at the end of December 2022, that level is basically being met and assume coming in.",115,,
691,0.97,5248.243,5254.248,At that point there is a couple of thoughts that--are really difficult to determine.,115,,
692,0.97,5254.248,5256.751,There's not a good data source.,115,,
693,0.97,5256.751,5260.321,We don't have historical experience that can well inform them.,115,,
694,0.97,5260.321,5268.196,That's where I thought some further consideration would be beneficial and I grabbed all the credit.,115,,
695,0.97,5270.331,5273.501,Rook at a variety of data sources.,115,,
696,0.97,5273.501,5278.606,I want it highlight that solid blue line you will see it starts to level out.,115,,
697,0.97,5278.606,5280.708,That's based on two Bigga sums.,115,,
698,0.97,5280.708,5285.313,One is an exit rate that we really have trouble estimates what it would be.,115,,
699,0.97,5285.313,5302.897,"It's not clear when that many clients are coming in, how many should becoming in and more importantly, the belief that we as a system, as a community we are investing in other programs, that can be alternatives to current legal system and provides support support that people need.",115,,
700,0.97,5302.897,5316.244,"There's a belief that by January of 2023, many of those programs would be Online and individuals that may otherwise in the past have been referred to lead would be identified as more appropriately referred to some of those other programs that.",115,,
701,0.97,5316.244,5320.748,Would day what you see as the number of referrals coming in.,115,,
702,0.97,5320.748,5322.116,There's a risk there though.,115,,
703,0.97,5322.116,5333.461,It's possible those programs aren't up and running by that time and a lot of environmental factors could have.,115,,
704,0.97,5333.461,5339.534,"If that wasn't true, what the case load arc may look like.",115,,
705,0.97,5339.534,5359.387,"Then the green line like I said when I worked PDA to develop instead of using some of Thosa sums about what may change in the community and what we think may happen, looking at some historical data that we have on hand in terms of how long clients are in the three broad stages you go through.",115,,
706,0.97,5359.387,5361.389,Outreach period not everybody goes through.,115,,
707,0.97,5361.389,5366.294,Maybe goes less around for a client.,115,,
708,0.97,5366.294,5366.627,Active case.,115,,
709,0.97,5366.627,5372.166,And then the stage where the individual may have stabilizes.,115,,
710,0.97,5372.166,5373.067,It isn't necessarily.,115,,
711,0.97,5373.067,5378.639,There could be emergencies or crisis that come up that are required that kind of engagement.,115,,
712,0.97,5378.639,5387.482,Looking at the rate that people on average are in the various stage is what the green line represents.,115,,
713,0.97,5387.482,5394.155,Kind of an estimate based on the partner survey what may happen if those links continue.,115,,
714,0.97,5396.057,5400.728,There's a few big things to know.,115,,
715,0.97,5400.728,5410.171,First you will notice--we will never get to a point where the number of exit from the program would seem to match the number of referrals.,115,,
716,0.97,5421.282,5421.682,Moor importantly.,115,,
717,0.97,5421.682,5433.094,Second there is a lot of policy implication that if we were at that point we may need to think about.,115,,
718,0.97,5433.094,5440.735,Having more referrals than it's possible to serve we could return to a situation in a pause in accepting the new referrals that.,115,,
719,0.97,5440.735,5449.377,May warrant policy decisions on who is an appropriate referral to the lead program or what are some changes in how services should be delivered to change that exit rate.,115,,
720,0.97,5449.377,5458.085,Last and I think most importantly in this--you talked about that in your remarks.,115,,
721,0.97,5458.085,5461.823,There's a lot of assumptions Nah are underlying these.,115,,
722,0.97,5461.823,5465.092,I just said just in describing how they were formulated.,115,,
723,0.97,5465.092,5483.678,I think that most significantly we--this kind of highlight that we need to carefully monitor verse Metrics in an environment where the lead program is being expanded to scale or in any level of increased funding to know what is happening with referrals.,115,,
724,0.97,5483.678,5501.462,For example as perhaps existing partners are able to refer the number of people they expect would we see other community source that are he Iferring new people or would there be a clay in at tide Aboutreferring people based off the ability to serve them.,115,,
725,0.97,5501.462,5502.864,That's things that aren't Knowable at this point.,115,,
726,0.97,5502.864,5509.203,We don't know if prior experience with how long an individual served would hold up overtime.,115,,
727,0.97,5509.203,5510.004,Things like that.,115,,
728,0.97,5510.004,5521.282,I think that carefully monitoring all these and what is actually happening in the environment wore any additional funding was provided would be important.,115,,
729,0.97,5521.282,5524.986,Nextly move to the second major request in the slide response.,115,,
730,0.97,5524.986,5529.023,"The information, the Council was seeking.",115,,
731,0.97,5529.023,5537.164,This is what if you take the case line and I'm just adding some number that you saw in the slide care.,115,,
732,0.97,5540.201,5562.023,In pose bore out and using the staffing service model that lead has put together where you--like a small portion like around 15% may need hotel shelter where you may assume a 1-20Ratio when someone is active clients.,115,,
733,0.97,5562.023,5567.028,"Things along those lines, ideal program situations.",115,,
734,0.97,5567.028,5569.73,"You can see that approximately, 2021.",115,,
735,0.97,5569.73,5572.5,Let me first focus you to what's on the bar.,115,,
736,0.97,5572.5,5579.874,That is what was presented by lead and is what is in the response to the slide that's been submitted.,115,,
737,0.97,5579.874,5585.446,The red bar may--maybe I should have picked a different color.,115,,
738,0.97,5585.446,5589.717,Is kind of what happens in this dotted line that I showed earlier.,115,,
739,0.97,5589.717,5595.89,Turns out that some things we think like other programs coming Online didn't happen.,115,,
740,0.97,5595.89,5601.028,Would we potentially in 2023 see higher funding than be are projecting.,115,,
741,0.97,5601.028,5603.898,The green bar corresponded with the green Baron the other side.,115,,
742,0.97,5603.898,5605.566,If we try to make that.,115,,
743,0.97,5605.566,5610.938,I think that it's interesting that we are in 2022.,115,,
744,0.97,5610.938,5618.012,Based off information that PDA got partnered institutions around the estimate.,115,,
745,0.97,5626.053,5627.855,Any expansion would me important it.,115,,
746,0.97,5627.855,5632.46,Would help them to understand if some kind of thing is being reached.,115,,
747,0.97,5632.46,5653.381,"If proper policies have been established for who should be put into lead and how long they should be served for or even things like we see assumptions that are made here about how often a person would be recommended by three sources, duplication of referrals and the rate that may go up.",115,,
748,0.97,5653.381,5662.289,Which could affect these cost estimates and may result in this being at a point that wasn't possible to project at this stage.,115,,
749,0.97,5662.289,5671.932,I hope that is somewhat useful and as further detail behind what was already presented I will turn it back over.,115,,
750,0.97,5682.009,5703.164,"This is what they was hoping for when writing and sponsoring the statement of legislative intent and just really appreciating the guidance that this is going to, I believe provide to us as we move into the budget process.",116,,
751,0.97,5715.776,5722.616,I will hold mine and hear from my colleagues on the committee.,116,,
752,0.97,5722.616,5723.517,Thank you.,117,,
753,0.97,5723.517,5724.051,I really appreciate this.,117,,
754,0.97,5724.051,5732.293,"The work you that have done with our central staff, work you have done to help us understand this better.",117,,
755,0.97,5732.293,5741.335,I think--it was Tiarra who said jail hasn't worked to address the needs of this population of the folk who are struggling.,117,,
756,0.97,5741.335,5741.936,I think that's important.,117,,
757,0.97,5741.936,5772.366,"You know even at the state level, the legislate officer Passioned this year the 988 Hotline for folk who are experiencing mental health challenges and I know for me when I go out to different parts of my district and talk to people who are concerned about the folks who they see struggling on the street the thing I consistently hear is that they want to be able to call for someone to help but they don't want to call the police.",117,,
758,0.97,5772.366,5774.135,"So, so I think this is an important program.",117,,
759,0.97,5774.135,5782.143,There is a lot of programs that are working hard to provide a response to public safety.,117,,
760,0.97,5782.143,5784.044,The lead program shifted.,117,,
761,0.97,5784.044,5792.353,"It's focus away from working with the police because as the previous presentation acknowledged, you know that just ends up causing more harm.",117,,
762,0.97,5792.353,5801.729,So I think that it's important that we support this work in the way we should.,117,,
763,0.97,5801.729,5804.632,That we support the various programs.,117,,
764,0.97,5804.632,5845.673,"I know it's an alternative as well but I think we can make a really important and significant impact on the folks who are experiencing Behavioal health challenges, if we listen to the previous panel and listen to the folks who are actually on the street here and who start to think of ways to invest in community based solution that don't involve the police so I just want to thank everybody for this work and I look forward to working with my colleagues through the budget process to see that we are investing in a way that leads toward the kind of outcomes that we are hoping for.",117,,
765,0.97,5855.115,5914.575,"I talk to this great panel of stake holders and probably a weekly basis about various thing that are going on in district 7. and I just want to take a second to really acknowledge the difficult year and a half where district 7 has had a huge amount of really big challenges in terms of having a high concentration of individuals with very significant unmet public health needs that in some cases are leading to significant public safety challenges that the people around this virtual zoom table have really been one of the biggest success stories in terms of providing real health dignity support, to all of the different stake holders in that process.",118,,
766,0.97,5914.575,5919.213,People experiencing trauma who need some kind of assistance in case management.,118,,
767,0.97,5919.213,5937.631,Business owners who feel like nobody in the city cares or is listening to them needing to assume a role of trying to be an expert in outreach and Deescalation and trauma because they can't get any other city service to come and assist with that challenge that they face.,118,,
768,0.97,5937.631,5954.181,I just want to really center that just the vision of everybody here in setting the expectation that he with develop city services that really do respond and center that response.,118,,
769,0.97,5954.181,5967.661,You know I talk to a lot of business owners in my district who always get nervous about a lot of our conversations around reform of the criminal legal system.,118,,
770,0.97,5967.661,5988.282,Reform of the public safety us is temperature because they fear that it's just a process of getting rid of existing services and not something about adding some new responsive system that will solve their core problem.,118,,
771,0.97,5988.282,6002.162,The Ork that lead and just care and the defender Association has done in really showing people how it can work has won converting to changing the system.,118,,
772,0.97,6002.162,6034.261,"It's shown business owners who have had long problems of police showing up, arresting a person that's causing some issue in the business, that person going to jail for a few months and going back on the street and repeat that thing for years, then finally having someone from lead come by, put that person onto their case work load, develop a relationship with that person, and solve that issue for everybody involved.",118,,
773,0.97,6034.261,6040.367,Solve the underlying trauma of the individual who has been on the street and the cycle of trauma and violence for years.,118,,
774,0.97,6040.367,6053.981,Solve the issue of the small business owner who wants a professional to deal with this competently instead of be in a position where they have to try to assume that themselves.,118,,
775,0.97,6053.981,6063.557,"And it's really, really been great to have all of you here as a resource to do that work.",118,,
776,0.97,6063.557,6075.269,"So, this idea that we take what has been developed over the course of the last decade plus and take it city wide makes a lot of sense to me.",118,,
777,0.97,6075.269,6088.348,I just want to put my stake in the ground that I would love to lead on this budget cycle in taking the next step to realize the goals and goals.,118,,
778,0.97,6097.925,6100.027,I think Tess is still on the panel.,118,,
779,0.97,6100.027,6123.684,"I want to talk a little bit about the three million dollars that's Council authorized to try to provide immediate support and relief to the lead program during this year so they can continue to do the work that they are doing in district 7, continue to do the Impactful work that is--and other districts in the city too.",118,,
780,0.97,6123.684,6135.929,"The work that is lifting up a lot of small businesses in Pioneer square, that is helping all the residents of Pioneer square, housed and Unhoused.",118,,
781,0.97,6135.929,6141.702,"And that three million dollars, my understanding could be taken in by the PDA.",118,,
782,0.97,6141.702,6146.073,I my understanding is they have the capacity to accept that investment.,118,,
783,0.97,6146.073,6151.378,My understanding is that it's critical for the Vibe of related programs like just care.,118,,
784,0.97,6151.378,6159.887,I would be Remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to publicly ask for a status on that investment.,118,,
785,0.97,6159.887,6164.992,Given the public safety crisis that we face in the street today.,118,,
786,0.97,6164.992,6167.794,Can we maybe just have a brief conversation about the hurdles there.,118,,
787,0.97,6167.794,6175.569,How we can trouble shoot it and what you may need test from the Council to realize that investment and get it out to the people who need it.,118,,
788,0.97,6175.569,6180.007,"Before we hand it over to Tess, thank you for the question.",119,,
789,0.97,6180.007,6189.316,I do--I just want to make sure that we don't get the--I have been--making this question as well in my regular meeting was Hsd.,119,,
790,0.97,6189.316,6198.325,I want to make sure we don't get sort of the same statuses I received a couple weeks ago in my last meeting.,119,,
791,0.97,6198.325,6223.216,What I heard was I think more than two weeks ago now was that there--Hsd is looking at a contract expansion and it was in the works and just in line with the spirit of Councilmember Louis's questions of if we could get a little more granular on what the barriers are and if there is anything we can do to help.,119,,
792,0.97,6223.216,6223.517,Thank you.,119,,
793,0.97,6223.517,6223.784,Hi.,120,,
794,0.97,6223.784,6228.055,Thank you very much for the question.,120,,
795,0.97,6228.055,6229.323,Unfortunately I can't get too granular.,120,,
796,0.97,6229.323,6233.86,Boy have to go back to the contracting team that's working on this with lead.,120,,
797,0.97,6233.86,6239.733,As I said this has moved out of the homelessness division.,120,,
798,0.97,6239.733,6242.302,I can't really spoke for others.,120,,
799,0.97,6242.302,6247.941,I will say though that I know it's actively being worked on.,120,,
800,0.97,6247.941,6256.683,There is ongoing conversations with the PDA and I believe that they are close to being at the end stage of this.,120,,
801,0.97,6256.683,6261.255,We can special get back to you with a more concrete answer.,120,,
802,0.97,6261.255,6261.455,.,120,,
803,0.97,6261.455,6266.793,Are yell I appreciate it.,121,,
804,0.97,6266.793,6268.295,Thank you.,121,,
805,0.97,6268.295,6280.374,"I have a couple of questions I wanted to ask first, I have even though she isn't here with us today.",122,,
806,0.97,6280.374,6295.122,I have brandy's voice in my made from the many weeks of participation that many of us did in the series conversation about creating community response model.,122,,
807,0.97,6305.165,6341.868,"In using the 911 response system, even in creating a community response model, there is a danger that traditional--given a menu of options, there is this--a danger that traditional police response will be the option chosen when responding to calls that are starting with complaints about individuals.",122,,
808,0.97,6341.868,6361.888,That--that there is a--I appreciate that much of your work is sort of triggered by the community referral model.,122,,
809,0.97,6361.888,6376.436,Relies on your--using the--the priority referral policy in order to identity who to assist with your services.,122,,
810,0.97,6376.436,6381.875,Folkswho may not otherwise get help if it was a result of a 911 call.,122,,
811,0.97,6381.875,6386.913,A result of a 911 call.,122,,
812,0.97,6386.913,6388.048,Response may often be a police officer.,122,,
813,0.97,6388.048,6413.273,"With in the context of the Council's efforts around 911, I would be interested to know because you currently--I know lead does--you don't necessarily get direct referrals 911 but you do get calls from help one for instance for your assistance.",122,,
814,0.97,6413.273,6438.598,"Stork just wondering, if there is--if you see a place sort of in that 911 crisis system for lead to receive referrals from the 911 dispatch as we are working on increasing the options, you know, we have obviously we have the police Department.",122,,
815,0.97,6438.598,6440.167,We have help one.,122,,
816,0.97,6440.167,6443.47,They are looking at triage one.,122,,
817,0.97,6443.47,6452.479,We are also pushing 911 and they are hope to it to also including Rerequire Physicalsa community based referrals.,122,,
818,0.97,6452.479,6470.897,"Just interested to know how you see or if you see lead fitting in to that crisis response, you are already in the crisis response but that--the crisis response that is triggered a call to 911.",122,,
819,0.97,6470.897,6484.177,"I always Pivot on that question because what I'm focuses on is the perceived or Actua, L crime and that's where lead does it's best work and where diversion could happen more.",123,,
820,0.97,6484.177,6491.184,If you remember on my 12 months looking back we have had maybe one or two arrest diversions.,123,,
821,0.97,6491.184,6512.472,"Because my belief is if will be really hard to Dedetermine if something when it's on that line, a crime, or a crisis situation and often there may be criminal activity that is associated with it but as your prove panel said putting this them the criminal legal system isn't the best way to go.",123,,
822,0.97,6512.472,6532.659,"I really would focus on for us, how could we divert when ever possible and keep members in the community, give them Importants that allow for behavior change and also has a response that is built for communities as a whole who may be felt they need to call 9191 and need a response in this moment.",123,,
823,0.97,6532.659,6536.997,I think that--the thing that--sorry.,124,,
824,0.97,6536.997,6549.776,The thing that has been really concerning for those of us who work with people who are alleged to have committed crimes and that's the source of the call for a city response.,124,,
825,0.97,6549.776,6558.652,Is that the focus on alternative 911 alternatives is always framed in terms of people who are not committing crimes.,124,,
826,0.97,6558.652,6568.561,The idea is that the police would come when people are suspected of committing crimes but there are other people for whom there should be alternative.,124,,
827,0.97,6568.561,6578.972,That line is being drawn in the wrong place and its being drawn in a way that's likely to generate pretty profound racial inequalities.,124,,
828,0.97,6578.972,6585.745,There can be alternatives for people who are both suspected and are actually committing crimes.,124,,
829,0.97,6585.745,6593.219,That's where this--that's the population that we focus on at the point of 911 call.,124,,
830,0.97,6593.219,6603.129,"There should be an alternative response to those people and yes, this--you know this network could be part of that.",124,,
831,0.97,6603.129,6614.174,"Also, importantly, a goal should be to reduce the incident of 91 is calls because community has another way to reach out for response to chronic situations.",124,,
832,0.97,6614.174,6623.083,And that is already starting to come into being and it could really already be there if we didn't have these capacity limitations.,124,,
833,0.97,6623.083,6623.917,Thank you.,125,,
834,0.97,6623.917,6634.194,"I think one thing to keep in our heads though, I totally agree that we want to reduce the number of call that are coming in to 911.",125,,
835,0.97,6634.194,6647.44,I just want to note that it is not true that every the 911 call is started because someone thinks that someone is creating a crime.,125,,
836,0.97,6647.44,6655.281,That's actually through the call analysis relatively small number of 911 calls.,125,,
837,0.97,6655.281,6678.204,"My question is really about 911 is receiving calls, that it's not a call--either right--it's identified right at the beginning as a call that is not related to a crime or through the dispatch protocol screening of calls, it is determined that it's not related to a crime.",125,,
838,0.97,6678.204,6695.522,There is interest that I think that's Council has expressed in the past and I know that the executive has as well as having a--a place to send those calls that is not placed police or fire.,125,,
839,0.97,6706.232,6725.018,"It sounds like it would be good to have more conversations about that and to recognize that--there's always that risk of even if you have a community Responder in that 911 area, who is going it get that Nonpolice response.",125,,
840,0.97,6725.018,6743.069,That is really--what I want to make sure if we add a community respond America to that I want to make sure that we are--this we are not adding to the racial disparity that already exist in crisis response.,125,,
841,0.97,6743.069,6749.142,May I add that we are speaking also from experiences that are happening.,126,,
842,0.97,6749.142,6752.979,We are getting health one referrals right now.,126,,
843,0.97,6752.979,6760.386,With Reeven getting--from the community process SPD referrals where people are in credit I sessions and don't know where to refer them to.,126,,
844,0.97,6760.386,6789.749,"We are getting those individuals and I think that part of what Lisa was saying before is there is a--[inaudible] to the long term case management which is what Jeff was talking about talking about what is the right dose for long term case management to stabilize individuals and really help them THR Isp not be calling on crisis, not be calling due to crime, not be calling for, you know, people being concerned in general, maybe not in those two categories.",126,,
845,0.97,6789.749,6802.262,We are definitely want to be collaborative and smart about how we use our program and partner with others and even refer out when we deem individuals not a best fit for us.,126,,
846,0.97,6802.262,6826.519,"And the other question I had, you know again, as we--as we go into the process, just thinking about how our analysis during budget may be more lighting up than the fantastic work that was--that is already been done.",127,,
847,0.97,6826.519,6838.631,Just wondering is there information that you feel is policing that you weren't able to access or that would help refine or bring more certainty to the actions we have.,127,,
848,0.97,6838.631,6867.994,I guess the only thing I would say is we think that the individuals that were estimating are pretty constant but we have to be aware that those individuals in the world that they are existing in could greatly change in the next year and how we receive those referrals and how we respond to those individuals on that front end May and can shift base on what we have been doing in the past year and what we have been in the past ten years.,128,,
849,0.97,6867.994,6871.798,I mean we can't--we are going to have a new city Prosecutor.,128,,
850,0.97,6871.798,6876.469,We don't know what that will look like for how the city responds to Misdemeanors and things like that.,128,,
851,0.97,6876.469,6880.073,We are going to have a new Mayor and potentially a new police chief.,128,,
852,0.97,6880.073,6891.417,"We don't know how they are going to lead those departments in terms of how they respond to public safety, public health concerns.",128,,
853,0.97,6891.417,6896.689,Those individuals who have fallen through the gaps that Devon describe reasonable doubt so well.,128,,
854,0.97,6896.689,6897.423,There's a need.,128,,
855,0.97,6897.423,6907.567,There's support and there's a way to respond and address the public safety concerns whether people are not calling the police or are calling the police that I think we are pretty well set up to do.,128,,
856,0.97,6907.567,6915.875,We always are open to and have been involving since the start that have program and definitely have been involving since the past year and a half.,128,,
857,0.97,6915.875,6922.348,We have a lot of lessons to learn and to be learned moving forward.,128,,
858,0.97,6938.064,6951.711,Appreciate Councilmember Louis's points about winning converts to--a what from traditional criminal legal system involvement to these alternatives.,128,,
859,0.97,6951.711,6960.186,Lead has been in the business of creating converts and before lead existed.,128,,
860,0.97,6960.186,6972.332,"I remember probably 20 years ago, when the PDA convened a meeting of residents of a downtown--I think the new mark maybe.",128,,
861,0.97,6972.332,6994.32,A downtown Condo who was very upset about the ongoing cycle through the--the police Department's by bus of folks who were dealing outside that building.,128,,
862,0.97,6994.32,7033.993,"Lead and even members of the police Department at that time were arguing that was creating a Sickle that did not really meet anyone's needs regardless of where you are coming from in this--on this issue for addressing the impacts of folks involved in--on Street activity that, you know whether or not you wanted to Foous on helping the folks and addressing their underlying conditions or you wanted to reduce the impacts on the living of the community that approach was not working.",128,,
863,0.97,7033.993,7076.402,"Much of those--those discussions with those downtown residents is what led to the development of something called clean dreams, clean dreams changed in to lead and this is, you know this is--this is two decades in and I'm just so--so honored and privileged to have been able to work with some of you for many, many years and just so in awe of the work you that do and building, building broad based community support for these alternatives and getting us to change the way that we think about the criminal legal system.",128,,
864,0.97,7076.402,7079.939,Really so grateful for all that you do.,128,,
865,0.97,7080.94,7083.342,Thank you so much.,129,,

880,0.97,7165.024,7173.933,Setting the table for an important conversation many many community Arounded country are having and indeed many policy that have passed.,135,,
881,0.97,7184.844,7204.83,Who have been asserted and dedicated over the course of the spring and moving forward and an important conversation about how we as a society treat Entheogens and particularly the one that are mostly been in the news.,135,,
882,0.97,7204.83,7208.401,Ha has been an instructive process for my own education.,135,,
883,0.97,7208.401,7220.079,I admit before this process I was not well versed in the science or the research that has been going on in the substances.,135,,
884,0.97,7220.079,7266.659,"My office was very proud to convene a symposium with people with experience, academics, and legal experts a couple of weeks ago and that can be found on my Website, highly recommended for people who want to learn more about this area that really detailed a lot of the public policy benefits to pursuing a process that Decriminalizes and increases the clinical use of a lot of these substances as well as the cultural, spiritual, uses of these substances and how they have been limited by the criminal legal system in the United States.",135,,
885,0.97,7266.659,7284.944,"So, the next step I want to take is convening this conversation on a resolution, some Vaiation of this resolution will be on introduction and referral today for consideration, hopefully in our full council session over the next couple of weeks.",135,,
886,0.97,7289.649,7304.263,Wanted to have a conversation to talk about some of the themes for the Symposiom for what this resolution aims to set up.,135,,
887,0.97,7304.263,7319.745,We are joined by a doctor from the University of Washington who is going to talk a little bit about these substances and about this movement around Decriminalizing and therapy use of these substances.,135,,
888,0.97,7319.745,7328.154,We have--from Decriminalize nature who has been a great advocate throughout this process.,135,,
889,0.97,7336.996,7339.565,It's been great to work with Ann.,135,,
890,0.97,7339.565,7341.667,She has been here to answer any questions.,135,,
891,0.97,7341.667,7346.072,Just to set up the general add of the resolution.,135,,
892,0.97,7355.815,7364.924,In raids to how they are conducting enforcement around possession of controlled substances.,135,,
893,0.97,7375.034,7381.774,A stance ever not Criminalizing possession of small counts of that substances.,135,,
894,0.97,7393.619,7418.978,A strong posture about action from the state which is the only group with the power to until the lead of our neighbor to the South Oregon to Decriminalize these substances and also create a group where they can be prescribed for to treat a variety of different conditions where they have been shown by study to be promising.,135,,
895,0.97,7432.358,7443.636,It were be best to start with Ann and then open it up to others to get a little bit more of a stake holder discussion.,135,,
896,0.97,7443.636,7446.138,Ann Why don't you kick it off?,135,,
