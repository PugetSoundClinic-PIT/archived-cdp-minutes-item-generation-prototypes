605,0.97,9553.31,9590.514,I wanted to say regarding this proposed transfer that I believe it is up to each Mayor to decide what they need to Enfe these laws and our current Mayor Mayor has concluded this to be E most efficient route to enforce parking so I support his decision . I know the general public cares that this work get done and parking is enforced and and fines are collected . We keep keep the revenue and deploy Thae that revenue to benefit the people of Seattle so I will be supporting this move.,198,,
606,0.97,9590.514,9592.316,Thank you . Other comments or?,199,,
607,0.97,9592.316,9661.785,"Or questions? okay . I will Havea few questions . You mentioned there is change management and L transfer functions the current administration is Prioritizing O ensure a smooth transition . I AG whether or not there's been an s of how to address those past BAS to efficiently doing the PEO work under Sdot has been considered first? some of the things I'm hearing and seeing in in the presentation sounds like it's a function of maybe unwillingness to share information or inability to share information from SPD to Te parking enforcement officers under Sdot . So if they commitment is to try to make sue these individuals have all the resources to share information, especially which vehicles might be stolen Why don't we start their X do we have a Conversatin about what resources the Parkint officers may need under Sdot toe greater access to the data while while still being held at Sdot?",199,,
608,0.97,9661.785,9695.452,"These are some of the rules that are not actually run by the the Department, by the Seattle police Department . This is run through the Washington state services and the Ncic . because we are a protected Department, an outside Department that is not actually funded by s would not have access to that information . When a vehicle is N is stolen, a PEO is not able to gain access to that information.",200,,

610,0.97,9713.37,9746.436,"Madam chair, if I could juste in . It's my understanding now the way this issue is handled is handled is that SPD provides tot to Sdot, and I'm not sure on the the frequency of this, a hot sheet that lists stolen vehicles that PEO's can use to determine to determine if a vehicle, if there is criminal nexus there were stolen and I would ask the chief to verify that and talk about how that process works.",201,,

612,0.97,9746.57,9776.032,We can verify that . Just having the vehicle plate listed as stolen . But the actual information of the vehicle Woult be something that would be given . registered owners and addresses and other Informationd information associated whether the vehicle is ready for impound impound or not impounded or recovery .

618,0.97,9835.425,9906.296,Certainly I'm not Purportingo offer a legal opinion on this issue but we did explore the authorization is held by the Washington State patrol and it s with the ORI codes on what information can be given out and and there is different analysis for just the facility access for for Cjis access and data access access of Cjis information and we were able to clear the first hurdle of giving them access to our building as they are currently housed within SPD but there is certain information that we could not transfer out via radio to them . I think and I I will confirm this and your Qun is a good one . with the hot Shes I believe that we can do is give give them static updates as to these lists of stolen cars rather than when they find a vehicle having them confirm it in the field in real time . I think that is the distinction but I will follow up and make sure we have full clarity on that issue.,207,,
619,0.97,9906.296,9912.002,And do you have additional information on that?,208,,
620,0.97,9912.002,9934.624,I do . Thank you . I checked wh checked with the chief at the CC because I was interested to know know if the Peos could get Cjis clearance through the Cscc . THC has Cjis clearance for their Dispatchers under and and O.R.,209,,
621,0.97,9934.624,9977.667,"I code . and what I had been told told by the director is that one one of his staff checked in Wite Washington State patrol and Wasd that Peos on nonperforming criminal justice purpose and would not be issued Cjis access under the Non- Cscc or under Sdot .

622,0.97,9977.667,9997.654,It seems very peculiar given that what they are doing is thee regardless of where they are at that the words you spoke suggest they think what they are doing is different depending on Wherey are housed and that is not the.,210,,

The databases are provided access to by those working for certified law enforcement agencies and because because they are not recognized as law enforcement agencies, Sdt agencies, Sdot or Cscc, because they're not recognized as law enforcement agencies, they don't don't have the same access as SPD which is a recognized law enforcement agency . so that Woud have to be a changing of laws Ae city law in order to change the ability to have access.",212,,

631,0.97,10107.897,10211.968,"Okay . additional comments or questions for the Department or senior deputy Mayor? I think it would be helpful to hear more from the folks who were part Ofe previous administration and/or L staff he was helping us Analyzee proposals, the competing proposals at the time to either move the parking enforcement officers to the community safety safety communications center or to the Department of transportation as requested by the then Mayor Jenny Durkan . The the reason I like to have the folks working on their previous analysis, and here is because nowhere in those deliberations did I ever hear a concern raised raised about parking enforcement enforcement officers not having access to that data . regardless of where people wanted the parking enforcement officers to end up, my recollection is Thaty was on board with helping to move them out, along with, as Councilmember Herbold noted, the the parking enforcement officers officers themselves who wanted to be part of Reimagining what their work would look like . So number one, did this come up, and I'm just forgetting about it it in our deliberations two years ago . because it seems like seems like that would've been an an impediment to moving them ine first place . and number two, and and this is not directed at the current administration because I I think you have all been Tryino identify where there has been challenges with implementation E you have arrived, but why were these individuals never offered a uniform or badge that did not say SPD? I think that's Problemc if our entire effort was to Tryo reduce what people perceived to be additional police presence due to parking enforcement officers being in neighborhoods and I'm concerned on both front.",216,,
632,0.97,10211.968,10230.353,Both fronts . is there anybody who could offer a reminder on whether or not that issue came up at all in 2020 and why these individuals were never offered a a change in uniform or badge?,216,,
633,0.97,10230.353,10282.105,I will offer a couple comments . I was not here at the Council at the time that it was discussed that based on conversations with our team I think it's fair to say the counselor was not provided complete information at during those deliberations from the administration about the implementation details that you are discussing . I think all of E of those are really valid and Fr questions about standing this out and I don't think the Councl had complete information provided to them at the time . I can't speak at this moment whether it was because of the rapid nature or the why but can clarify based on conversations I I don't think we have all of that on the table.,217,,
634,0.97,10282.105,10297.754,"Okay . Thank you, director Handey . I ask that because I want to make sure the take away is not that a decision was made haphazardly . that it was made solely by Council at the time.",218,,
635,0.97,10297.754,10357.914,This was a joint decision between the executive and the Council in 2020 and I think there has been some assumptions made by those who are covering the issue of the parking ticket that that somehow was connected to a quick decision when it was very much a joint decision informed by the previous Adminin previous administration on terms terms of where they wanted folks folks to go and I also don't bee don't believe that the final decision on where and where and if commissions should happen that led to having to pay out those parking tickets balls at Sdot's feet . I do believe Theres some additional analysis that's needed to understand more of where SPD's interpretation of what the law was led to having to make those decisions not to t a Commission and that set I also also want to thank the senior Dy senior deputy Mayor and Mayor Harrell who acted with urgency when they realized there was a gap N the commissions to try to to make sure they righted that.,218,,
636,0.97,10357.914,10413.002,"That wrong . This is a much Longr conversation we've had over the course of two years so it's Fru, as you can tell, to have to now learn information that should have been available in 2020. Buo as the chair public safety and vice chair of budget is noting it seems there are opportunities opportunities for us to jointly look at ways to try to mitigate for some of the lack of Supportr lack of information that some of of the parking enforcement officers are able to perceive in in their current place so I look I look forward to continuing the conversations with this Adminisn and to helping to make sure these workers have the support t they need so they have an Addedt of being part of community safety and also they get the support they need within the city family . senior deputy Mayo, I see your hand.",218,,

We did try to act as quickly as possible once we Fint find out where these gaps were and this is definitely one of those, as you mentioned, where it was as much of a surprise to us as it was to you . I think Whn we had to share this information--I will say that we Continueo try to work as clearly as Possie through these challenges and we have worked really closely indirectly with the Peos around what they think can help them Dr jobs right now . We also have heard from them pretty clearly t clearly that they would welcome the opportunity to speak with any on Council who would want to to meet with them and talk with them . I know that a number of U have pretty good relationships with them . They did want me to extend the offer to be available available to anybody who would want to meet with them and speak speak to them about the challenges they have had over Te last year . that offer is open .

What this ISS is is Sdot is giving back to SPD all of the money that is spent to pay for fleets, facilities, s, computers, employment, SD hr G hr hiring, although central costs the city charge each Depat each Department . those costs were moved from SPD over to Sdod now they are coming back to Spdd the last component is $829,000 t $829,000 that is distinct to the the PEO unit for overtime for parking enforcement and special Evnts . and for some background,, when it comes to working any kind of overtime, generally Peos Peos spend about 75% of the overtime hours working special s special events and about 25% of their hours working parking Enft when they are getting paid over.",230,,
660,0.97,10914.169,10921.043,"Paid overtime . that's what's coming over with that $829,000.",230,,
661,0.97,10921.043,10954.677,"One of the things I want to point out here . This one $.1 million in citywide charges for central costs . I won't refer to that as overhead, per se . that s a distinct piece which is fleets fleets and facilities and Tech infrastructure . that does not include the Sdot Department costs that we will talk about in about in a minute . Sdot has its own indirect costs and direct costs, such as the office of director of finance and Adminis.",230,,
662,0.97,10954.677,10980.436,And administration . They have indirect costs that includes leadership and management . They have a pool of Employee-Paid BES Employee-Paid benefits . I'm Notg to get too much into it to say t Sdot gathers its own internal costs and then distributes or ALLOCATES those out to its funds . that is separate and Apat and apart from this one $.1 Mil.,230,,
663,0.97,10980.436,11016.138,"It's added to this one $.1 million . those things, when we are talking about those things D SPD, the management, the chiefs, Chiefs, the folks that would oversee the parking enforcement unit at a higher level like the captain level or the chief level, those folks are already D for by the general fund . So there is no cost to move them back to SPD . But, if they stay in Sdot, then those costs for Sdot are allocated out to the Fs the funds . and with that I will turn it over to Calvin to explain how that works.",230,,
664,0.97,11016.138,11016.372,Thank,231,,
665,0.97,11016.372,11044.833,Thank you . that is a really important distinction . I want tt this isn't really a policy choice so much as it's done by accounting and staying clear with funding sources but the biggest difference is that the E Department is funded by a Generl Fund . It is one Fund and we can line item does costs and budget those appropriately . The issue for Sdot is they have multiple D sources including Reimbursablesd transit thing for some costs.,232,,
666,0.97,11044.833,11071.66,Grant funding coming from the state or Federal Government . So how do you allocate those Department costs across all these different fund Sourcesin a way that's equitable and can be accounted for according to the best accounting practices? the way that Sdot does it is by rolling those into a total Costf essentially overhead of indirect of indirect costs and Allocatine costs based on employee hours W.,232,,
667,0.97,11071.66,11097.052,"Hours worked . You can imagine this means if you have a construction worker working on the Wsdot grant project, the time they spent working on thatt that project, they would cover a cover a portion of the overhead from Wsdot through the money spent on the project . Conversely Conversely they would do that Fr other projects with different FG sources . It leads to a very Esoc and convoluted cost recovery Mo.",232,,
668,0.97,11097.052,11144.032,"Recovery model . If you could Goo the next slide . This slide Showu essentially what is the difference if you left the Peos in Sdot or not and how those cost allocations change among Dt fund sources . It is not an overall change in the total cost cost of these indirect costs, BT it changes very much who bears those costs and it's really because you're talking about 12L Fund-Supported new Sdot employes Sdot employees that work on general fund work and so are Asd a much higher level of the Indit costs in that labor shift.",232,,
669,0.97,11144.032,11162.784,I just want to jump in here and put a finer point on that last piece . This goes for the cs and viewing public . It does not cost more to the city as a whole as a whole to have parking enforcement and SPD or in Sdot.,233,,
670,0.97,11162.784,11194.449,"Different funds pay for the cost cost of parking enforcement depending on where it lives and so this issue that there has been a lot of concern that there there is an additional cost and it would be an additional $8 min cost to the general Fund, and Wd there is a significant general fund deficit this year and so that is a choice on the table.",233,,
671,0.97,11194.449,11198.754,We also heard this morning thatt is facing many shortfalls too and there are tough decisions there about which projects to P.,233,,
672,0.97,11198.754,11211.767,"So the choice here is not where does the cost more . It is, Councilmembers have a policy choice awarded the thing parking parking enforcement should live based on that policy choice, a different set of funds are Goino pay.",233,,

Greg, you Explainedt well and, Calvin, you have shown the dollar figures here to make make the point . The distinction that central staff made for me is this is not actually cost Sas mechanism, it's a cost avoidance avoidance mechanism for Certains versus others so I want that to set in with Councilmembers.",234,,
674,0.97,11247.703,11275.964,Director Handey summarize the point that came from central staff as well and it is important for us to center thin policy decisions .

679,0.97,11335.59,11370.959,". If we make the policy Decisioo keep Peos in Sdot, how we avoid a situation that has occurred, and I believe is one of the precipitating factors for the Ul Ul P where we have a department who will respond to that policy decision by not hiring the Numbr of Ftes, if we don't add the Adl the additional $8.3 million in.",235,,
680,0.97,11370.959,11445.734,"In funding . I think there are multiple objectives here, and Ik one of them is ensuring the Department is fully staffed and that our workforce is supported by our engagement in addressing the vacancies that are creating more issues for the Department D Department and leading to capacity challenges and addressing other policy needs associated with the work they do . So I'm trying to understand if the end result is in order to to ensure that the number of Ftes are hired to serve as Peos that we want to and we also make make the policy decision if it were to make the policy Decisiot they were to stay and Sdot, Isnt it still true that in order to have both those things be accomplished we would have to find the additional funding?",235,,
681,0.97,11445.734,11454.009,Yes . Thank you for the question and the opportunity to clarify . I will take a crack at it and invite Kal or Greg if I t get it across the finish line.,236,,

683,0.97,11465.453,11517.606,"We would fund the full positions plus the general fund would fund $8.3 million of the overhead of the Sdot overhead so so that Sdot did not have to und to understand or hold vacancies open . that is different than what was done in the past and Ie past the general fund did not Fd not Fund, or did not budget for the portion of Sdot overhead but but did have to pay for it over time . and when I say there isn't a difference in the absolute cost to the city, on Cal's chart, it shows $93 million off off the bottom . that is the amount expected for Sdot's overhead next year .. that is going to get paid either way.",236,,
684,0.97,11517.606,11583.505,"Whether it's by the list of funds described there . The difference is if the Peos are at at Sdot the general fund will pay for a bigger part of that Od that overhead if the Peos are at are at SPD, the general fund will pay a smaller part of the overhead .. as you will see in Te last column of change, the Red s show if the general fund is paying $8.3 million of that static $93 million, we expect cs expect costs savings in the transportation Fund and we see the levy Fund and the Transportn benefit district Fund, et cetera . part of what Kal Alludeo is it's challenging because those are not line item Overheas overhead items in the Sdot budget so the accounting is NOTE as Crystal-Clear as just doing D to swap, as we would like . that said we know there will be costs cost savings .

I'm trying O trying to sort this all out for myself and it seems like this is this is an internal funding Isse and wondering about if there is a way to give Sdot a break on the cost of Peos or address the difference in indirect cost allocation for them rather than make this giant move? something to talk about off-line .

We are truly having a conversation around what the policy is here . and it's not just on the cost, as you heard from SPD . There are many operational concerns they have raised . and to go really in in the weeds we have a number of of Standard, indirect cost modes in the city that we use and Sdot Sdot has selected one of those models if there is not a cost L cost model, to echo the point that was just made, that would eliminate this requirement and L allow the Department to have clean financials . really appreciate the conversation and thank you for letting me take a moment to celebrate our teams.",242,,

It is a noticeable improvement and I Thk it's leading to improved Discusn about the budget over all . As you can tell some of the frustration about not having Ths information two years ago, if anything, it's been very heartening to see the level of open books that are being Sharen the legislative and executive branch and I will credit the deputy director, who suggested this format so we could have this Back-And-Forth . It makes it it challenging, as I noted come up for the director . makes it G for me to make sure I'm facilitating a discussion versus versus a debate, sometimes .
