11,0.97,42.575,43.81,I am here.,4,,
12,0.97,43.81,47.981,Seven present.,5,,
13,0.97,47.981,53.286,Let's go on to approval of the minutes.,6,,
14,0.97,53.286,61.194,"The minutes of January 31 will be adopted . seeing no objections, the minutes are adopted.",6,,
15,0.97,61.194,69.536,"Move on to the Presidents report . normally I don't have a lot to Che, but I have more today.",6,,
16,0.97,69.536,80.113,"On today's agenda, we will be hearing from the office of governmental relations and also Councilmember Strauss will be proposing a proclamation.",6,,
17,0.97,80.113,83.75,"With that, I would like to give you a few updates.",6,,
18,0.97,83.75,88.488,"As you can see, for tomorrow, we will start a new format on approval of the consent calendar.",6,,
19,0.97,88.488,102.302,"You will notice on tomorrow's agenda, there is a new section titled approval of the consent calendar.",6,,
20,0.97,102.302,106.573,I would like to share with you a few things to know about how we plan to use the consent calendar.,6,,
21,0.97,106.573,111.344,The consent calendar will contain items that can be approved in one motion at the beginning of the Council meeting.,6,,
22,0.97,111.344,115.648,Any item can be removed from the consent calendar at the request of the Councilmember.,6,,
23,0.97,115.648,119.886,"If an item is removed, it will be taken up immediately following the adoption of the consent calendar.",6,,
24,0.97,119.886,121.921,"To begin, only the following items will be approved.",6,,
25,0.97,121.921,126.593,That is the Councilmember IRC.,6,,
26,0.97,126.593,141.641,"In the future, we will include apartments that have already been hurting committee . The payroll bill and possibly any other clerk files or counsel bills that have already been hurting committee and also our routine.",6,,
27,0.97,141.641,146.312,"Again, we are working out the bugs.",6,,
28,0.97,146.312,147.747,So this is not written in stone.,6,,
29,0.97,147.747,152.852,There is movement to change things if people have different opinions about that.,6,,
30,0.97,152.852,158.057,This process is similar to the budget consent package we are in.,6,,
31,0.97,158.057,167.6,A number of open items were approved with one vote in any item can be pulled and heard individually and voted on individually at the request of any Councilmember.,6,,
32,0.97,167.6,176.776,The consent calendar is a tool used by legislative bodies to handle routine items publicly and in a more expedient way.,6,,
33,0.97,176.776,191.391,"What I'm trying to do is moving along with everything so there is more opportunity for Councilmembers to talk about what they did last week, what they did is we, what they will do next week, I don't need you to read the whole diary into the record.",6,,
34,0.97,191.391,193.66,I know Councilmember Strauss is not happy about that.,6,,
35,0.97,193.66,196.829,So that is hopefully where we are headed.,6,,
36,0.97,196.829,204.437,"So next, we are going to have another wonderful report from our state legislative team.",6,,
37,0.97,204.437,212.312,Gail is the dark and I will hand it to Gail for briefing and discussion.,6,,
38,0.97,212.312,212.512,Gail?,6,,
39,0.97,212.512,220.453,Thank you . hello to all of the Councilmembers.,7,,
40,0.97,220.453,236.569,"It is happy fiscal cut off day in Olympia for the house and Senate side, and I do refer to it as happy fiscal cut off day because now we know what is coming before us for the next five weeks before the end of session.",7,,
41,0.97,236.569,257.023,"So I know many of you have made yourself available at the last minute to speak with testimony in front of the virtual Olympia, and to raise concerns as well as interest and commitment to colleagues in the Seattle delegation working hard for all of us.",7,,
42,0.97,257.023,266.933,"Thanks so much for that and I will turn it to Quinn, our state relations director who is back in the game.",7,,
43,0.97,266.933,270.97,"And to Alton Brown, our state lobbyist.",7,,
44,0.97,270.97,285.051,I think Elsa is going to kick it off and Sierra Brown will have a couple things to pass on regarding the Federal affairs Potfolio after Elsa and Quinn.,7,,
45,0.97,285.051,294.193,Thank you.,8,,
46,0.97,294.193,296.429,We really appreciate the time before all of you.,8,,
47,0.97,296.429,298.264,"As she mentioned, it is fiscal cut off today.",8,,
48,0.97,298.264,307.807,So I would say we will know the breath of those bills still moving forward at the end of the day if not now because there are still ongoing executive sessions and transportation committee.,8,,
49,0.97,307.807,319.385,"So not fully determined yet . on the Council bulletin that I shared with you all last night, some of the bills have not made it out of policy committee.",8,,
50,0.97,319.385,328.561,"Does have a strike through them, which means they are unlikely to move forward this session.",8,,
51,0.97,328.561,331.364,"I think I mentioned this last week, but never say never on a bill.",8,,
52,0.97,331.364,335.868,There are some special cases where a bill will be considered necessary to implement the budget.,8,,
53,0.97,335.868,338.271,"In which case, it is not truly dead, but may come back.",8,,
54,0.97,338.271,342.575,It is rare for a bill to be declared and Tib.,8,,
55,0.97,342.575,350.883,"It is a good rule of thumb that if it hasn't made it out of committee and we have struck and it through, it will likely not to move forward.",8,,
56,0.97,350.883,355.722,But just to raise the concept that there are some exceptions to that.,8,,
57,0.97,355.722,366.499,We will be looking for this next week to House of origin cut off work so bills will need to be off the floor of their House of origin by the 15th.,8,,
58,0.97,366.499,376.375,Exciting upcoming news is also the expected release of the supplemental budgets for this session.,8,,
59,0.97,376.375,393.126,There will be a revenue forecast on the 16th and we expect the budget for the capital operating and transportation will be released soon after that revenue forecast comes.,8,,
60,0.97,393.126,403.469,So those are some of the highlights of what is to come this coming week or so.,8,,
61,0.97,403.469,413.012,"You know, I would say Quinn will be covering some environmental priorities and transportation priorities in their current status.",8,,
62,0.97,413.012,414.247,But I will touch on housing.,8,,
63,0.97,414.247,419.652,We are still following the middle housing proposal that the governor has introduced.,8,,
64,0.97,419.652,428.06,It is up for executive session in House Appropriations today.,8,,
65,0.97,428.06,435.768,"I don't believe it is yet moved, but we will continue to watch that, the Senate version did not move forward, so the House vehicle is the sole vehicle on that policy.",8,,
66,0.97,435.768,439.672,I think I mentioned there were some other similar concept bills.,8,,
67,0.97,439.672,446.512,They have been either stripped down or have not moved forward.,8,,
68,0.97,446.512,495.628,"So 1782 is the vehicle that we will be tracking for you all moving forward . In addition to that, we are continuing to track 1880 housing benefit district bills to articulate Seattle's interest in being included in that bill, and continuing to support the Governors policy 5662 to develop in the governmental process between the state of Washington and the city of Seattle and other local jurisdictions on Right-Of-Way issues . part of the governor's proposal is significant funding for housing and for operations of that Intergovernmental process.",8,,
69,0.97,495.628,500.333,So we will continue to follow that.,8,,
70,0.97,500.333,502.602,I think that is probably the top issue I would mention.,8,,
71,0.97,502.602,510.71,The housing space . Some of you have been asking us to follow some safety net and Healthcare legislation this year.,8,,
72,0.97,510.71,520.419,"Unfortunately, some of those exciting new concepts are not likely to move forward this legislative session.",8,,
73,0.97,520.419,521.287,That include concepts like A.B.,8,,
74,0.97,521.287,542.808,"Bonds and also concepts around basic income . We are not expecting significant near revenue . legislators have indicated because of some of the work that was done last year, they are probably going to be holding steady on major tax and revenue issues this year.",8,,
75,0.97,542.808,553.486,So some of those more innovative safety net bills are likely to be in for the discussions years to come because they would require significant new revenue.,8,,
76,0.97,553.486,569.835,Then I think it was the Councilmember who brought up following this fertility bill Unfortunately that will also not be moving forward and there has been some reproductive rights bills not moving forward this session.,8,,
77,0.97,569.835,577.543,"I think with that, I will turn it to Quinn for some transportation and environment policies.",8,,
78,0.97,577.543,580.112,But am available for questions about specific bills you all,8,,
79,0.97,580.112,585.451,Thank you.,9,,
80,0.97,585.451,587.887,It is a pleasure to be back with you all here.,9,,
81,0.97,587.887,592.792,I went to extend my deep thanks to Gail and Elsa for making sure the city was Fabulously represented in my absence.,9,,
82,0.97,592.792,598.264,"Just my profound thanks to Seattle for allowing me to spend some time bonding with my son, Luca.",9,,
83,0.97,598.264,606.939,"On the matter of Olympian state legislative session, a few updates in environment and transportation.",9,,
84,0.97,606.939,632.832,"The biggest environment is some bad news, although not entirely unexpected, Senate bill 5697, the renew act, which would make further improvements building on last year's Epr extended producer response ability legislation, building on those further improving our States recycling and product stewardship rules and regulations.",9,,
85,0.97,632.832,638.304,That did fail to advance the session.,9,,
86,0.97,638.304,644.81,"It did move out of the policy Committee, which I think is thanks to some of the tremendous work done by Sbu and the other advocate.",9,,
87,0.97,644.81,648.614,But Unfortunately it is not going to be moving out of the fiscal committee today.,9,,
88,0.97,648.614,660.76,Unless a lot of positive groundwork for some Far- reaching and ambitious legislation that I think will benefit us and other advocates moving into the next legislative session.,9,,
89,0.97,660.76,666.098,Better news on the transportation front.,9,,
90,0.97,666.098,688.854,"The city's top priorities in terms of moving, extending the pilot an automated enforcement sent a bill 7507. doing some clarification around their renewals around transportation benefit district authority 1523, the Senate companion.",9,,
91,0.97,688.854,695.327,"Those have all passed out of their respective policy and fiscal committees, transportation.",9,,
92,0.97,695.327,703.502,"Those are now hedges, so we will continue to monitor those.",9,,
93,0.97,703.502,704.27,That is good news.,9,,
94,0.97,704.27,716.682,The other issue I wanted to highlight is we are expect thing and have heard that house and Senate transportation leadership will be announcing their proposal for a transportation revenue package tomorrow.,9,,
95,0.97,716.682,717.483,It is very exciting.,9,,
96,0.97,717.483,724.49,I want to clarify it is probably going to be a little bit different from some of the proposals that we saw last year.,9,,
97,0.97,724.49,741.24,"We have heard in contrast to those proposals, it's not going to include any new tax revenue, it's going to be primarily revenues from the climate commitment act, some new fees, unused bonding capacity and a few other things.",9,,
98,0.97,741.24,758.057,"It will be smaller and focused a lot on Backfilling some gaps on existing projects, investing more money and making some preservation and more money in some grant programs, which the city is poised to be competitive for, certainly.",9,,
99,0.97,758.057,768.701,"So we are hopeful we might get some funding for some city projects, which I know are of interest to you.",9,,
100,0.97,768.701,777.009,"We don't have confirmation, but we will find out tomorrow and we will be back with more information and details for you next week.",9,,
101,0.97,777.009,778.811,I see a hand up.,10,,
102,0.97,778.811,779.278,Councilmember Strauss.,10,,
103,0.97,779.278,784.55,Thank you.,11,,
104,0.97,784.55,785.985,"Great to see you, congratulations on Luca.",11,,
105,0.97,785.985,799.765,"My question is one that you probably are already familiar with and I know doctor Carlton is involved with this as well, the regional transportation corridor . If you don't know the answer now, happy to circle back off-line.",11,,
106,0.97,799.765,814.78,"I just want to make sure some portion of that is still in negotiations and hearing what you said, focused on maintenance and preservation of existing structure FALLS in that category.",11,,
107,0.97,814.78,822.488,So no need to provide updates now unless you have them at the tip of your fingers.,11,,
108,0.97,822.488,823.656,I would love to circle back.,11,,
109,0.97,823.656,826.158,"Unfortunately we don't have language at this point, or a project list.",12,,
110,0.97,826.158,827.86,We expect that to come out tomorrow.,12,,
111,0.97,827.86,836.001,"We are hopeful about North Aurora and the other projects we have been working on these past couple years, but we will not know for sure until tomorrow.",12,,
112,0.97,836.001,838.304,But we will follow up.,12,,
113,0.97,838.304,846.378,Any other questions? Quinn is smiling so happy being a new dad.,13,,
114,0.97,846.378,852.351,But that will end.,13,,
115,0.97,852.351,853.586,Just giving you a hard time.,13,,
116,0.97,853.586,855.821,Good to have you back.,13,,
117,0.97,855.821,861.727,Any of the questions from the colleagues before we move on and we can say goodbye to our friends at Oir?,13,,
118,0.97,861.727,868.467,"Council President, Sierra have had an update on --",14,,
119,0.97,868.467,870.002,I saw her memo.,15,,
120,0.97,870.002,893.392,The only thing of NOTE I would mention is we were expecting and hoping for fiscal year 22 appropriations to be passed by February 18 and that is looking a lot less likely now . They are currently negotiating a third Cr continuing resolution that will extend that process further and get the more negotiating time.,16,,
121,0.97,893.392,895.16,Just wanted to put that on our radar.,16,,
122,0.97,895.16,896.495,We had the 18th is a deadline.,16,,
123,0.97,896.495,901.1,That might be good to push.,16,,
124,0.97,901.1,902.868,Any Federal questions I would be happy to answer.,16,,
125,0.97,902.868,907.606,Any questions for Sierra?,17,,
126,0.97,907.606,909.241,Good afternoon.,18,,
127,0.97,909.241,915.881,Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has been engaged in the session.,18,,
128,0.97,915.881,919.985,"Welcome back, clean.",18,,
129,0.97,919.985,921.22,It is good to see you.,18,,
130,0.97,921.22,932.598,"Just wanted to say thanks because I recognize how many bills again for the second year in a row, maybe the third, that you have been dealing with remote nature and how many bills Oir is fielding.",18,,
131,0.97,932.598,939.104,I am so thankful for your work and to be doing this on a cut off day . It is a huge sacrifice of your time.,18,,
132,0.97,939.104,940.506,So thanks for checking this with us.,18,,
133,0.97,940.506,961.627,"I did want to also take a second to talk about a bill you may have already discussed, but I want to flag for all of us and the public Seattle has been very supportive of the voting rights act legislation, whatever Iteration it comes in, and if you're my understanding is Senator Saldana had bill 97.",18,,
134,0.97,961.627,969.802,Unfortunately it sounds like the Association testified in opposition over the weekend.,18,,
135,0.97,969.802,975.407,I wanted to make sure we were explicit about our support for expanding access to voting.,18,,
136,0.97,975.407,981.146,Remind folks to vote for tomorrow for the local elections as well.,18,,
137,0.97,981.146,1000.399,Is there any update on Senator Saldana's bill and anyway we can support 5997 Besides sending messages of support their way and trying to calendar Awc?,18,,
138,0.97,1000.399,1001.867,Thank you for flagging that for us.,19,,
139,0.97,1001.867,1004.67,The city of Seattle is supportive of voting rights.,19,,
140,0.97,1004.67,1017.95,One thing we have highlighted for you every week on the bulletin is Senator Huntsville on increasing automated voter registration with the Dol in that type of thing.,19,,
141,0.97,1017.95,1023.389,We have shared Senator Saldana's legislation for reviewing our city attorneys office and we are monitoring the bill.,19,,
142,0.97,1023.389,1035.768,Happy to discuss that off-line with you further.,19,,
143,0.97,1041.206,1045.344,"Council President, I think you are on mute.",20,,
144,0.97,1045.344,1050.816,I just made a joke . are you sure you have got nothing,21,,
145,0.97,1050.816,1054.219,You know I do.,22,,
146,0.97,1054.219,1056.922,Oir is very accessible.,22,,
147,0.97,1056.922,1065.23,Thank you for that in addition to the labor policies and the housing bills that I know you are tracking.,22,,
148,0.97,1065.23,1073.172,I just wanted to lift support up for the voting rights act.,22,,
149,0.97,1073.172,1073.472,Thank you.,22,,
150,0.97,1073.472,1073.972,Thank you.,23,,
151,0.97,1073.972,1076.809,Anything else you want to add before we say goodbye?,23,,
152,0.97,1076.809,1079.678,Thank you for your time Council president and members of the Council.,24,,
153,0.97,1079.678,1086.585,We will be back next week with probably a lot more information about budgets.,24,,
154,0.97,1086.585,1086.985,Yeah.,25,,
155,0.97,1086.985,1091.89,Thank you so much and thanks for meeting with me off-line and answering questions.,25,,
156,0.97,1091.89,1092.257,Thank you.,25,,
157,0.97,1092.257,1095.961,Thank You. & GT; & GT; we will see you.,26,,
158,0.97,1095.961,1097.663,So let's get back to our agenda.,26,,
159,0.97,1097.663,1105.27,It looks like Councilmember Strauss has a proclamation for our signature.,26,,
160,0.97,1105.27,1113.178,Do you want to lead us in your discussion about the clash?,26,,
161,0.97,1113.178,1115.147,"Which probably started before you were born, but go ahead.",26,,
162,0.97,1115.147,1117.649,That is true.,27,,
163,0.97,1117.649,1122.354,That is correct.,27,,
164,0.97,1122.354,1133.832,Something that is special about the clash to me is the fact the things they hit on takes generations to implement and change.,27,,
165,0.97,1133.832,1142.241,So the clash days started 10 years ago when John Richards decided to play multiple clash songs in a row.,27,,
166,0.97,1142.241,1153.252,"Being independent radio, John was able to do this without any oversight and this became and turned into international clash day.",27,,
167,0.97,1153.252,1167.733,"This, sorry . It became formalized as clash day, the National clash a day and international clash date and communities began participating.",27,,
168,0.97,1167.733,1168.667,"The clashes stand against racism, fascism.",27,,
