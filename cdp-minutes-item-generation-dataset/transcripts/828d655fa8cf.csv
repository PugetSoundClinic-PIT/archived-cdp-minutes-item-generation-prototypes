126,0.97,734.633,757.389,I do want to briefly mention last week and lift up the great work that Jeff Sims and Tracy--on central staff has done in aggregating together for us at the Statistics around shelter and housing for people experiencing homelessness during Covid.,16,,
127,0.97,757.389,783.983,"I think I am going to stitch that information together into some kind of supplementary report or public review to get a sense of the nature of how our shelter system and housing have evolved and changed during Covid given the early need to De-Intensify, which has resulted in less supply but increase quality of shelter.",16,,
128,0.97,783.983,798.43,And the incredible increase in state and Federal support for acquisition of housing that is going to lead to a massive influx of social housing over the next couple of years.,16,,
129,0.97,798.43,810.042,And to present this information in a publicly accessible report . I'm not sure what form that's going to look like at this point.,16,,
130,0.97,810.042,830.329,"I think it was very illuminating to really see that the very visible homelessness crisis we see on the streets of Seattle have been tracking very closely to the reduction in shelter supply and that our outreach strategies have been most successful at times when new shelter assets, Online.",16,,
131,0.97,830.329,837.903,And that that is a demonstrable relationship that should instruct how we move forward and respond to the homelessness crisis.,16,,
132,0.97,837.903,845.945,I would note that this is going to be a very big fall for the opening of new shelter assets.,16,,
133,0.97,845.945,866.899,I don't want to steal any thunder from Councilmember Pedersen because I believe it was last week that Councilmember Pedersen hosted an open house at the University district tiny House village that he has been a great champion and getting stood up along with the rest of us here on Council in the budget last fall.,16,,
134,0.97,866.899,880.713,"That tiny House village, I believe, is going to start taking referrals in the middle of October to be quickly followed by a tiny House village expansion Interbay as well as tiny House North Seattle later this fall as well.",16,,
135,0.97,880.713,889.021,To also track along with the opening of several additional shelter assets and several hundred units of housing.,16,,
136,0.97,889.021,911.343,"I do think that it would be helpful for the public to see all of that condensed into a report that they can really sink their teeth into and see the magnitude of the investment down the pipeline and the fact that we, as a city have had to really have to struggle through a year and a half of having very, very little new shelter asset being stood up.",16,,
137,0.97,911.343,920.719,"I would remind the public that it is now, as of today, October 4, and all of 2021 has not been a single new tiny home that is opened up.",16,,
138,0.97,920.719,924.156,That's about to change.,16,,
139,0.97,924.156,925.658,"Obviously, here in the final stretch.",16,,
140,0.97,925.658,941.04,It really has shown that our struggle with getting our neighbors inside has mostly been due to the fact that we have a--places to offer them to go.,16,,
141,0.97,941.04,948.147,I do look forward to presenting that information to the public and look forward to having a fall defined by a lot of these Council investments finally be realized and being open.,16,,
142,0.97,948.147,959.291,I am going to have kind of a fun and unique experience I guess on Wednesday where I have been invited by a neighbor to go on a bike ride with the Dutch consul general.,16,,
143,0.97,959.291,972.905,Not really sure what level of a regional Council general or for the entire country who is visiting Seattle.,16,,
144,0.97,972.905,989.588,We are going to go for a bike ride in true Dutch fashion and look at ways Seattle could become a more urban and better planned in Dutch tradition.,16,,

152,0.97,1026.325,1032.231,What's up with these Dutch people now?,19,,
153,0.97,1032.231,1033.665,I want to get on that bike.,19,,
