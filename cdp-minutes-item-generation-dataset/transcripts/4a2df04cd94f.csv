539,0.97,4503.532,4561.023,"Although there was an ongoing protest, it seems to me like there were peaceful daily protests when chemical weapons and more extreme weapons like blast balls were banned, but before and after these more violent crowd control methods were used, there was often violence so I'm kind of suspicious of the story often told by the police of what was happening at the protest . The police budget is much larger than the Seattle parks and recreation budget . one of my favorite things about Seattle is all the great libraries, parks, and community centers that provide lots of recreational and educational opportunities.",91,,
540,0.97,4561.023,4580.742,"I'm noticing in the budget, I understand things are difficult budget -Wise and with Covid now, but I'm disappointed to see the closing of community centers, pools, and reduced maintenance.",91,,

548,0.97,4610.973,4619.281,I live in district 3 and I am calling for a couple of things.,93,,
549,0.97,4619.281,4632.561,"One, I want to echo what everyone is saying which is fantastic, that now is the opportunity to follow through on the promise you made this summer to defend SPD by at least 50% and make sure that all of the funding goes to black and Brown restorative justice programs.",93,,
550,0.97,4632.561,4643.672,"I am concerned, the Mayor has said she is allocating $100 million to black and Brown indigenous communities but there is not much of a plan.",93,,
551,0.97,4643.672,4649.978,One of her criticisms of Defunding the police is that there is not much of a plan.,93,,
552,0.97,4649.978,4654.616,I find this concerning because black and Brown restorative justice programs have existed for a while.,93,,
553,0.97,4654.616,4655.417,They have a plan.,93,,
554,0.97,4655.417,4665.594,Need the funding . T they just we just need to defend them and give them the money because they know what to do with it.,93,,
555,0.97,4665.594,4670.298,My other concern is the Jumpstart Seattle and funding that would raise.,93,,
556,0.97,4670.298,4683.512,"It needs to go specifically to what we pushed for which was affordable housing, specifically to house our most vulnerable people and our homeless population in Seattle.",93,,
557,0.97,4683.512,4697.526,"On top of that, we also allocated $18 million of that specifically to go to affordable housing in the central district specifically for black households.",93,,
558,0.97,4697.526,4712.541,It would be concerning to actually raise the money and not spend it on that because that's what we push for and what we were speaking to people about when collecting signatures.,93,,
559,0.97,4712.541,4719.448,People really felt it was important that housing was built specifically in the central district 1ST.,93,,
560,0.97,4719.448,4729.191,I would hope that you please keep these things in mind when you are finalizing or starting this 2021 budget process and that's what I want to say.,93,,
561,0.97,4729.191,4729.591,Thank you.,93,,

566,0.97,4750.112,4755.217,We received 418 referrals for our precinct when we were allotted 75 for the first year.,95,,
567,0.97,4755.217,4761.089,"People who are homeless, use drugs, and most recently who have been evicted.",95,,
568,0.97,4761.089,4785.647,"After years of incidents inside and outside of the motel it was finally shut down at the behest of neighboring people resulting in immediately displacing--people but loss of shelter for people who would be able to rent there without an Id, the mentally ill without having the police immediately called on them, or be able to stay there with friends or have someone paying their bills.",95,,
569,0.97,4785.647,4796.458,Many folks have never heard of housing resources and felt that services who fit their needs or make the vulnerability of asking for help a possibility.,95,,
570,0.97,4796.458,4808.036,"History of generational poverty, family history and the Secs trader, and yes, violence and crime has condemned people to the mercy of systems that do not make the space for them.",95,,

572,0.97,4808.837,4816.578,"Meet people where they are, treat them with dignity, respect, hospitality, and take the time to know them as people.",95,,
573,0.97,4816.578,4825.887,Think of plans together that will get them to the goals of where they want to be.,95,,
574,0.97,4825.887,4853.915,"This is liberation and what gets in the way as harmful barriers, funding not been released as promised, and inflexible Abstinence-Based program policies . The Mayor and the citizens of the city, as you come to terms with racism inherent in our society I urge you to make AMENDS and keep in mind people on the street who don't feel like they don't have until tomorrow or next week and who have been failed by every system we have ever created.",95,,
575,0.97,4853.915,4855.283,Thank you.,96,,

578,0.97,4870.332,4882.611,I wanted to talk about the austerity budget which failed to defend the police and actually proposes to continue hiring officers despite this whole summer of protests.,97,,
579,0.97,4882.611,4897.759,"While working people suffer, black and Brown working people suffer disproportionately from the pandemic, the Mayor is also cutting vital public services like parks and libraries that working people defend on because she refuses to make Billionaires and corporations pay their fair share.",97,,
580,0.97,4897.759,4907.669,She is determined to put the Puck cost of this crisis on the back of working people despite the fact that Billionaires have increased their wealth by over $600 billion during this crisis.,97,,
581,0.97,4907.669,4925.387,"I wanted to share that in contrast to this, the people's budget struggle led by Councilmember Sawant want funding for community Passageways, and other restorative justice programs that are proven to reduce violence by investing in services, not more cops.",97,,
582,0.97,4925.387,4937.399,We can do the same now but trusting Mayor Durkan or the promises of Councilmembers who promised to defend and then refused to even second the legislation is a debt.,97,,
583,0.97,4937.399,4958.92,"I really want to thank Councilmember Sawant for every year since she elected, fighting to Defund the SPD and I want to urge everyone to join us on October 20 for the people's budget town hall to help us build this movement together.",97,,
584,0.97,4958.92,4968.229,Greg and then Greg will be followed by Steve and Reverend Yang.,98,,

587,0.97,4974.736,4979.441,I like to register my support for the 2021 proposed budget.,99,,
588,0.97,4979.441,4989.217,"I am for Councilmembers taken the difficult road to real reform involving first and foremost, acknowledging that city council can no longer continue to legislate in a vacuum.",99,,
589,0.97,4989.217,5002.831,"Any budget passed by this body must take account of many Stakeholders including not only the protesters expressing righteous anger at the state of police reform and accountability, but also the groups that have been working to implement the Legally- mandated process that has been underway for nearly a decade.",99,,
590,0.97,5002.831,5026.554,Going forward they must Prioritize working Collaboratively to enact legislation that do not conflict with the Federal consent decree and would like to emphasize the importance of this process over all other tools at our disposal including the Half-Baked proposes to reduce the budget by an arbitrary 50%.,99,,
591,0.97,5026.554,5028.59,As one Councilmember said all roads lead to the contract.,99,,
592,0.97,5028.59,5038.7,"If we fail for reforms, it will be impossible to create meaningful change around the injustices that we wish to address, full stop.",99,,
593,0.97,5038.7,5048.71,"Moreover, legislation will provoke lawsuits which the city will lose bumping us back to square one.",99,,

1305,0.97,11319.574,11368.724,"What I wanted to mention is, I want the Council to seriously consider the fact that the city of Seattle has approximately 750,000 total residents within city limits and I've been on the phone with everybody else, I suppose, 2 1/2, going on three hours and I've heard a lot of testimony and I want to enforce the fact that the testimony that I've heard has come from mainly two or three groups and I want the city to just remember that while the goal of ultimately trying to help those who need help is obviously important and nothing that I disagree with, you have to also remember that they do not necessarily represent 750,000 people.",220,,
1306,0.97,11368.724,11384.106,"When I'm here to speak of is what, and this is not a political thing, but when I see every day, living and working around downtown Seattle, I have gone into work in downtown Seattle every single day since March and since the virus began.",220,,

1308,0.97,11392.714,11399.855,"What happens is, when that occurs, people start voting with their feet.",220,,
1309,0.97,11399.855,11423.578,"You may not hear them calling in baby other than myself because I've witnessed it over the last six months personally, but take, for example, and I'm not a commercial real estate broker, but right now there are over 3,000,000 Ft.B2 of Subleas space available in downtown Seattle, much of which has come due to the fact that the people can no longer feel safe working there.",220,,
1310,0.97,11423.578,11447.202,"You have to remember that that space represents the loss of about 5000-10,000 jobs so it's important to counsel to remember that the way that you get your revenue in order to fund what I support, in Jenny Durkan's budget, comes from businesses being in and employing people who have been on this phone.",220,,

1317,0.97,11500.155,11509.264,The views are not representative of the city of Seattle as a whole but I want to draw the attention to the 96 calls before me that virtually all supported the solidarity budget and calling for Defunding a speedy.,223,,
1318,0.97,11509.264,11520.275,I am also calling to urge you to do vest from that by at least 50% and support the distribution of funds divested from SPD through a Participatory budgeting process.,223,,

1321,0.97,11542.063,11544.799,You cannot fund both the disease and the cure to these community issues.,223,,

1336,0.97,11677.499,11700.455,"My name is Gabriel, I'm a Renter in software engineering D3 and I'm calling to say like so many others before me that the support among my friends, my colleagues, and my neighbors in the city, in particular here in D3 and Capitol Hill, for reallocation of funding from the police Department to community programs, housing remains enormous he supported and is a given among people you talk to.",226,,
1337,0.97,11700.455,11705.56,It seems like the noise around the defined movement has died down because of the abundant trust that residents have in our elective elected officials.,226,,

1341,0.97,11724.079,11732.954,The key detail that commitment was a full 50% investment of our bloated police budget and reallocation of those funds into community investments and services that will Proactively fight crime before it starts.,226,,
1342,0.97,11732.954,11741.896,Goes without saying that the $200 million in proposed cuts are entirely at odds with that commitment to justice.,226,,

1606,0.97,14021.273,14036.088,What I'm going to say is that I'm happy to continue to go out there and essentially get beat up by the police because I believe black lives matter and I believe that you are working to make sure that black lives matter in Seattle.,268,,

1621,0.97,14170.589,14192.745,"Now the parks are full of tent villages, but without a system and garbage pickup, and it would be a lot cheaper to move them to empty apartments that they are sleeping underneath then to create a sewage system for every park.",270,,
1622,0.97,14192.745,14212.531,I also wanted to remind you that Teargas causes abortion and the cops that are using it are possibly getting it into our water supply and I want you to take that away from them.,270,,

1727,0.97,15052.103,15057.876,A lot of the problems we are having downtown and with homelessness were based on policy decisions that were not made by our community.,287,,
1728,0.97,15057.876,15069.821,They were made by other people who thought they knew what was best by Gentrifying our communities and putting us in bad situations.,287,,
1729,0.97,15069.821,15073.491,Now they are blaming community for those poor decisions.,287,,
1730,0.97,15073.491,15081.8,But did not have a Participatory budgeting process and did not incorporate the communities that would be most impacted.,287,,

1733,0.97,15098.049,15108.76,The Mayor's budget is really the maintaining status quo and that's basically upholding it to racism and that is very Anti- black.,287,,

1743,0.97,15184.802,15195.213,"I've talked to my district representative, the Mayor, I haven't heard anything from a Kansas City representative.",289,,
1744,0.97,15195.213,15208.76,"The Mayor was the one who told me to to contact, I want to see the homeless situation being handled and I do not think that Defunding the Poilice is the way to go.",289,,

1750,0.97,15238.59,15250.201,I'm calling about something a little more specific and less global than the bulk of the other callers and I really hope this doesn't come off as a rent totally devoid to compassion.,291,,
1751,0.97,15250.201,15258.109,I'm a Renter who lives on quiet dimly lit one Lane street in district 4 that has become a magnet for homeless campers.,291,,
1752,0.97,15258.109,15266.417,"My neighbors and I fully understand, sympathize and empathize with the plight of the homeless.",291,,
1753,0.97,15266.417,15277.228,"Simultaneously, our Street has become a constant locust for theft, vandalism, drug use, prostitution, verbal abuse of residents and destruction of city property.",291,,
1754,0.97,15277.228,15285.737,"We are forced to put up with needles and condoms, Excrement and unspeakable amounts of garbage on her street.",291,,
1755,0.97,15285.737,15297.715,We live in a frequent state of anxiety wondering if her home would be targeted for vandalism if we go out for an hour's worth of Errands.,291,,
1756,0.97,15297.715,15302.954,Please do not disband or duly cut back the various task forces that are supposed to help your constituents with these problems.,291,,
1757,0.97,15302.954,15308.993,"Otherwise we are essentially saying deal with it, thank you very much and I yield the remainder of my time.",291,,

1760,0.97,15326.744,15345.063,Good evening I'm a Homeowner in district 2 and I support the solidarity budget and asked them to Defund the police and relocate the funding to community priorities.,293,,
1761,0.97,15345.063,15347.699,I see this is not just an equitable decision but a sound financial one.,293,,
1762,0.97,15347.699,15352.737,There are a lot of other investments that will get a better return than we are with policing.,293,,
1763,0.97,15352.737,15354.405,I want to highlight three things in particular.,293,,
1764,0.97,15354.405,15359.477,"First, settlements, the police Department will be sued multiple times in the next year for police misconduct.",293,,
1765,0.97,15359.477,15366.818,I see an allowance of one point 5 million for funds.,293,,
