294,0.97,2027.392,2041.272,This property transfer protects the possibility of a valuable land under their feet being sold out from under their feet whenever the political establishment might want to raise funds other than looking for raising progressive revenues.,88,,

310,0.97,2206.137,2212.577,I am just wondering what the status is on that one because it is the last one of the three that we identified in the 2018 resolution as priorities.,90,,
