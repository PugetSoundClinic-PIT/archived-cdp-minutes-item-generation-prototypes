84,0.97,407.64,414.046,It's important to note that Spu's strategic plan has been endorsed by the rigorous customer review panel.,17,,
85,0.97,414.046,421.354,At the previous committee meeting we heard from both the customer review panel and our central staff analysts.,17,,
86,0.97,421.354,430.062,"Fortunately, the average Spu rate increases are expected to be lower than what was promised back in 2017.",17,,
87,0.97,430.062,440.072,Keeping rates low is important because rates are Regressive with lower income households paying a larger percentage of their household income for utility bills.,17,,
88,0.97,440.072,464.797,"There is a thorough article in today's Seattle times about the strategic plan and great path, which EXPLORES all of the various cost drivers, including inflation, Pass-Through rates imposed by King County for wastewater, environmental protection projects required by the state and Federal governments, labor costs, and the utility taxes charged by our general fund.",17,,
89,0.97,464.797,472.972,It also points out that we do not currently maximize the use of system development charges.,17,,

100,0.97,532.465,537.003,Sdot proposes to divide the $7 million each year into six different categories.,17,,
101,0.97,537.003,553.185,"The amendment that we discussed two weeks ago would actually implement Sdot's plan for at least the first year, and simply asks Sdot to provide a list of infrastructure projects that could benefit from $100 in bond financing.",17,,
102,0.97,553.185,556.856,Bluetooth the bond against the vehicle license fees to generate more money faster.,17,,
103,0.97,556.856,562.295,I want to thank everybody who called in during the public comment periods.,17,,
104,0.97,562.295,571.804,"There appeared to be some confusion and misinformation about the three-page amendment, which does not actually issue bonds, but actually asks Sdot to come back with a list of infrastructure projects.",17,,
105,0.97,571.804,574.307,A list they should frankly already have.,17,,
106,0.97,574.307,585.484,"Special shout out to Nicole grant, the head of Mlk labor Council to calling into our committee to speak and proposal support.",17,,
107,0.97,585.484,594.026,"We could have voted that proposal out of committee last week, but I held it to give certain interest groups more times to read the amendment and consider it.",17,,
108,0.97,594.026,609.976,"While the funds would benefit almost all modes of transportation, the amendment does emphasize bridge infrastructure that has long been neglected, as we have seen with the sudden and costly shutdown of the West Seattle bridge negatively Impacting marginalized community.",17,,
109,0.97,609.976,614.447,As well as the audit of bridges showing the deteriorating condition of our city's agent bridges.,17,,
110,0.97,614.447,630.763,"Sdot's original plan will still be the guide, not only for Sdot to craft their $700 million budget, but also for how to invest tens of millions of dollars that can be generated by the bonds, if we choose to do that in the fall budget process.",17,,
111,0.97,630.763,638.17,"Our state Legislature accomplished a lot during the passed four months, but they did not pass a transportation package.",17,,
112,0.97,638.17,642.174,We were hoping to get $25 million for the West Seattle bridge.,17,,

157,0.97,957.589,983.015,The protest action was organized jointly by various organizations . It was fitting that our protest was outside the bill and Melinda gates foundation building.,19,,
158,0.97,983.015,994.593,Bill gates has been one of the Billionaires fiercely and vocally opposed to allowing generic versions of the vaccines to be produced in various countries like India.,19,,
159,0.97,994.593,1006.538,"Speakers from the various organizations highlighted how stunning it was for Billionaires to put profits over human lives, even in the face of what can only be described as an Apocalyptic tragedy unfolding in India and some other nations.",19,,

166,0.97,1049.782,1056.889,Trade Representative told the media that they are continuing to examine their WTO proposal.,19,,

168,0.97,1064.663,1076.608,I know we should keep in mind that bill gates's medical potentials begin and end with him being one of the richest people on the planet.,19,,
169,0.97,1076.608,1083.982,"As I explained this passed Monday, this passed Friday was the start of a new round of WTO negotiations with the meeting of the Council for trade -Related aspects of intellectual property rights.",19,,

174,0.97,1110.342,1122.855,"The overall summary of the situation is that on the one hand, we have 2 million regular working-class people in the United States, along with their unions, including the National nurses United, and countless community organizations supporting the waiver.",19,,
175,0.97,1122.855,1139.438,"On the other hand, have pandemic Profiteers . We are see matt Biden's representatives has Prioritized meetings with the Billionaires, not with them unions in the community organizations.",19,,
176,0.97,1139.438,1148.547,The fact that the Biden administration claims to be undecided about the waiver this time around clearly shows the power of the grassroots organizing that gathered to million signatures.,19,,
177,0.97,1148.547,1155.654,"Previous to that, the Biden administration [Indiscernible] opposing the waiver.",19,,
178,0.97,1155.654,1157.155,This is really showing the pressure.,19,,
179,0.97,1157.155,1170.302,It also shows that we will need to continue organizing without which we will see the status quo of the Biden administration continuing to represent Billionaires if they can get away with it.,19,,
180,0.97,1170.302,1186.518,"That's why we have to do everything in our power, in the grassroots, to make it clear that there will be political consequences if they continue to defend the profits of big Pharma, over literally what [Indiscernible] what is at stake is the lives of millions of people.",19,,
181,0.97,1186.518,1205.837,Last week a group of 17 central district constituents went to my office deeply concerned about reports that the Seattle fire Department plans to set controlled fires at a soon to be demolished church building at 2001 South Norman street in the heart of the central district.,19,,

186,0.97,1242.207,1254.786,"The stated purpose of a controlled burn is for the fire Department training, which is obviously training is extremely important, given how dangerous it is to fight fires.",19,,
187,0.97,1254.786,1262.26,"We know that the fire Department workers do this dangerous work every day of their lives, and they do so courageously.",19,,
188,0.97,1262.26,1273.972,"However, we also don't understand why is it necessary to hold this training in the middle of a dense working-class residential neighborhood already facing disproportionate environmental toxins?",19,,
189,0.97,1273.972,1289.121,"The question we have asked the fire Department in the Mayor's office, is what fire Department officials consider such an intentional environmental threat with an upper-class predominately white neighborhood such as Madonna.",19,,
190,0.97,1289.121,1309.641,"I urge Mayor Durkan and the fire Department to find a location for training that has a much more mitigated risk of air pollution than in this Densely populated, predominantly people of color central district neighborhood over the weekend, all Councilmembers were sent a Video of a small black lives matter protest.",19,,

192,0.97,1320.752,1333.565,"According to the constituent who sent this Video to the Council, the Seattle police Department chose to arrest the Protester who suffered the vehicle or assault, not the driver of the vehicle, which is outrageous.",19,,
193,0.97,1333.565,1347.379,"If true, this is another example of the Seattle police Department targeting black lives matter and other progressive movement protesters for arrest, without even attempting to appear to have--to uphold the so-called equal protection under the law.",19,,
194,0.97,1347.379,1372.204,"In the passed, when the proud boys, in a very reaction Oh far right proud boys would attack progressive protests with the stated goals of specifically starting a fight, the Seattle Department would again and again address . We know why, because SPD officers joined the proud boys in the violent assault on the capital in January.",19,,
195,0.97,1372.204,1388.22,"This continued bias in arresting progressive protesters is totally unacceptable and shows why we need to Defund the police, and why we need elected community oversight with full powers over the police and a real focus on ending inequality in society.",19,,
196,0.97,1388.22,1392.391,Which is statistically the main source of crime and problems in public safety.,19,,
