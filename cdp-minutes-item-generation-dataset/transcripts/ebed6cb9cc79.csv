73,0.97,495.628,503.002,"The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for a special time on Thursday, July 15 at 2:00 P.M.",7,,
74,0.97,503.002,515.248,The committee will discuss the two bills we begin the last Committee on the fight for Renters to have a Renters bill of rights.,7,,
75,0.97,515.248,541.44,The first bill requires that is up for discussion that we already discussed began the discussion last week requires the last time requires landlord to provide six months notice for renting increases and the second one that is also under discussion requires landlords to provide relocation assistance when they displace the tenants without rages rent increases.,7,,
76,0.97,541.44,554.32,"This process is known as economic Evictions . I expect that we will bring both these bills to a vote at the committee following the next one, on July 27.",7,,

78,0.97,565.431,576.742,We know the crisis for Renters is deepening . that is because no time in jacking up rents in 2021.,7,,
79,0.97,576.742,581.514,Seattle landlords have raised rents at an average of 18.7% between January and June 2021.,7,,
80,0.97,581.514,590.623,According to an industry analyst apartment Was.Com.,7,,
81,0.97,590.623,616.515,In 2021 landlords are increasing Seattle rents are double the national average and this is just stunning . to put this in more concrete terms these 2021 rent HIKES will cost a typical Seattle Renter an additional $3300 a year in increased rent . This is coming at a time when tens of thousand Seattle Renters are deeper in debt due to the Covid pandemic and the recession that hit the capitalist economy all of last year.,7,,
82,0.97,616.515,639.505,"The same apartment Was.Com, which is a landlord Website, the same report from apartment List.Com boasted to the landlord clients that quote pandemic pricing is officially over and also quote 2021 has seen some of the fastest rent growth we have on record in our data.",7,,
83,0.97,639.505,658.658,The shocking 2021 rate increases are precisely why we need to ban the rent increases without six months notice and require landlords to pick up the cost of the trauma and dislocation because when they Evict tenants through rent increases which of the two bills under discussion in the committee.,7,,
84,0.97,658.658,664.764,And we need rent control on top of that.,7,,
85,0.97,664.764,688.387,About a year ago I started at an Amazon press conference with the dozen clergy and community activists and Socialists to the man the city establishment support the central area housing plan which have been developed by the--the senior pastor at the church and also other area clergy members from churches.,7,,
86,0.97,688.387,723.089,As a result of this advocacy and with hundreds of community members joining us we want an amendment in the final bill to dedicate a portion of the Amazon tax each year toward central district affordable housing which was an important accomplishment and directly a victory for the black lives matter protest that year but we also know that is not enough and over the years I have spoken with many faith leaders including prominently black clergy members who are eager to build affordable housing on their properties and also are advocating for affordable housing throughout the city.,7,,
87,0.97,723.089,732.531,As part of the struggle they understand the urgency and the moral mandate for affordable housing throughout our region.,7,,
88,0.97,732.531,743.008,The Reverend explained how 50 years ago the city's Democratic establishment at that time essentially forced the church to sell its land to the city.,7,,
89,0.97,743.008,757.623,"And the selling price of taking it through eminent domain was $34,000 . This was a travesty against Seattle's church community and against the black working class and the working class as a whole.",7,,
90,0.97,757.623,764.63,That land today is worth probably more than $2 million.,7,,
91,0.97,764.63,782.181,At least a part of the property can and should be developed into affordable housing and the clergy members and community members are starting to demand this happened.,7,,
92,0.97,782.181,798.631,The church in partnership with the low income housing Institute has developed a plan to build affordable housing for 87 households on this previously stolen property with community preference for people who have been displaced or threatened with displacement because of rent increases from the central district and we know this project as he jointly needed.,7,,
93,0.97,798.631,821.72,Reverend has spoken eloquently about how the city needs to make reparations that happened 50 years ago by giving the land back to the church community and to the black working class and funding the $10.7 million that are needed to complete the project.,7,,
94,0.97,821.72,850.149,"Working with a wide range of Union and community members and black lives matter and policy rights activists my counsel office is preparing legislation that would ban the Seattle police Department from engaging in training with States that have been found, States meaning Nationstates, that have been found to violate International human rights.",7,,
95,0.97,850.149,861.527,Last year's historic black lives matter Street protest movement put a spotlight on the role of the police and the state under the system of capitalism.,7,,
96,0.97,861.527,872.137,Police departments in cities across America many cities like Seattle with a Democratic party control establishment brutally aired out by the repression of peaceful protest Marches.,7,,
97,0.97,872.137,887.82,"Long before the violent repression of last year's protests, the Seattle police Department has had a history of excessive force as we know especially directed against black and Brown communities and against poor people.",7,,
98,0.97,887.82,896.362,No fewer than 11 people have been killed at the hands of the Seattle police than any 17 went Democratic Mayor Jenny Durkan was elected.,7,,
99,0.97,896.362,918.684,The Democratic establishment has failed to hold the Seattle police accountable and among the community demands is Seattle police must be banned from training or having any exchange with the military or police of any nation violating the Geneva convention of the United Nations which are basic humanitarian standards that have been agreed to internationally over the last 70 years.,7,,
100,0.97,918.684,926.725,The city Council has an obligation to support the legislation my office is bringing forward in solidarity with organizations to do that.,7,,
101,0.97,926.725,943.275,Not everyone has been familiar with the fact that the Seattle police Department has admitted in the last eight years they sent top officers including former chief Carmen best to train with the Israeli police and military forces.,7,,
102,0.97,943.275,944.643,This is an example of what this legislation seeks to prevent.,7,,
103,0.97,944.643,957.756,Which is engaging with Nationstates that have violated the Geneva convention.,7,,
104,0.97,957.756,989.555,"It is troubling because it is the same Israeli state forces that have been responsible for Brutalizing the Palestinian people for decades and were condemned worldwide by unions, state communities, human right groups and governments just this past spring for their brutal and Disproporionate military assault on the people of Gaza and the attempted Eviction of Palestinians from East Jerusalem . The Israeli state has been found by organizations such as amnesty International and Israeli right Humanization's to violate the Geneva convention.",7,,
105,0.97,989.555,995.194,And its violent attacks on Palestinians and the forced seizure of their land.,7,,
106,0.97,995.194,1021.687,The International Court of justice found the Israeli state violated the fourth Geneva convention of humanitarian rights of Palestinians . United Nations human right counsel has determined that the Israeli state violated International Humn and civil right laws and committed war crimes against Palestinians and in January Israeli human right groups detailed systemic human and political right violations by the Israeli state in the report.,7,,
107,0.97,1021.687,1051.25,"All of these are very mainstream large organizations, international organizations that have documented these facts and in addition the Israeli state is also failed to provide the Covid vaccine to quote the vast majority of the nearly 5 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza strip . Even though the majority of Israeli citizens have been Vaccinated.",7,,
108,0.97,1051.25,1059.858,The quote is from human rights watch which is documented this discrimination and as noted it's a failure to comply with the fourth Geneva convention.,7,,
109,0.97,1059.858,1128.16,"This is an example of weather is a clear human rights violation and why it is important that the city council should take a stand and support this legislation from our office which is being advocated for by many organizations including--unions like UAW 4121, Seattle education Association and--as one community member who wrote today when they sign our petition calling for the and to be stranding said quote it is unethical for Seattle police to train with Violators of international law most citizens and officials in Seattle decried former President Trump's willful disdain a violation of national and international law we need to be consistent and our respect for basic justice . I expect to circulate a draft of this and I invite all Councilmembers to cosponsor if interested.",7,,
110,0.97,1128.16,1146.011,"My office is working with a broad range of community groups in the central district who have for 15 years developed and Complet renovations and improvements to the Playfield's, facilities and other public spaces around the Garfield community center.",7,,
111,0.97,1146.011,1154.92,This coalition is a grassroots effort in the central district to create a vital civic space that honors and tells the story through art and cultural presentations of the people who have lived here over the millennia.,7,,
112,0.97,1154.92,1158.724,From the--to the black Americans today.,7,,
113,0.97,1158.724,1197.696,"The Garfield Superblock and working with the parks and recreation Department aims to enhance the area around the Garfield community center and the Garfield high school with art that Liberates the area's history, new trees and walkways to ensure access for all, new safe publicly accessible bathroom facilities and other urgently needed community amenities . The Garfield Superblock is precisely the kind of excellent public project that should be funded in neighborhoods like the central district . We know when completed this will be a community Jama.",7,,
114,0.97,1197.696,1219.718,"Later this month when the city council takes up the July supplemental budget my office will be proposing an amendment to use $500,000 at least of the $5.4 million of the Council that voted to take out of that police Department to invest in Garfield Superblock project.",7,,
115,0.97,1219.718,1222.387,Which I mentioned is a concrete demand by the community to Chiffon from the police to urgently needed community projects.,7,,
116,0.97,1222.387,1241.206,"I urge community members to learn more about it and urge cast members to join me in supporting this community amendment Additionally immunity members are welcome to join me and the Garfield Superblock activists and committee members in celebration and display of the project next Wednesday, July 14 at 5:00 P.M.",7,,
117,0.97,1241.206,1242.841,Outside the community center.,7,,
118,0.97,1242.841,1266.164,"Just quickly to reiterate, Garfield Superblock project has received some funding as well with $500,000 in supplemental budget it could get to shovel ready status and it already has some construction funds lined up.",7,,
119,0.97,1266.164,1268.333,In addition to enhancing the community the project would create good Union jobs for the neighborhood.,7,,
120,0.97,1268.333,1288.553,We know we need more of this kind of space and we need this as an alternative to our Militarized police Department that is committed acts of violence among some of the same community members that will need these facilities and will use them.,7,,
121,0.97,1288.553,1297.996,We know the completion of this project will amplify the space as a historic place making ground it is honoring the history of the central area.,7,,
122,0.97,1297.996,1306.805,"Last week during the city council briefing at talked about the legislation my office had recently sent for introduction to the Council President's office to Decriminalize various Psychedelics like magic mushrooms, I Alaska and Mdma.",7,,
123,0.97,1306.805,1318.817,We also send a courtesy copy to Councilmember Herbold . My office intended to refer the builder committee after it was introduced.,7,,
124,0.97,1318.817,1325.791,As I explained last week in the briefing we first made the request to refer a bill to the public safety committee two weeks ago.,7,,
125,0.97,1325.791,1341.973,"And if Councilmember Herbold is unwilling or unable to schedule, I am happy to refer to the Sustainability and Renters rights committee that I chair instead.",7,,
126,0.97,1341.973,1353.085,"I am flexible on what committee it is referred to by a concern by the delays I am having in he introduction . Resear shows that many Psychedelic drugs have a powerful potential to be used in the treatment of Ptsd, depression and addiction.",7,,
127,0.97,1353.085,1355.787,And some have little or no harmful effects.,7,,
128,0.97,1355.787,1388.22,"The substance that can be harmful like ecstasy, the harmful effects are the result of other drugs as research shows like Methamphetamine . in Canada they are offering free testing of drugs without any risk of arrest and essentially this is a testing tent where you can bring your drugs to see if you're able or if what you're about to consume is what you think it is or it is laced with something more powerful.",7,,
129,0.97,1388.22,1395.66,This has saved many lives.,7,,
130,0.97,1395.66,1398.063,But the premise is that it works because people are willing to use it because I don't have the risk of arrest.,7,,
131,0.97,1398.063,1430.028,"The point is, the drugs even the drugs that can be harmful we know overwhelmingly it has been shown that the criminal justice system is a terribly inhumane and also ineffective response and it is part of the failed war on drugs and it has expanded mass Incarceration so dangerously and Psychedelics are only a small part of the mass Incarceration.",7,,
132,0.97,1430.028,1439.771,But they are part of it and we should not delay passing the our Demo Criminalization.,7,,
133,0.97,1439.771,1454.553,"Unfortunately as I said the introduction of the legislation is being delayed for a second week because Councilmember Herbold, who is not here today, I will be talking to her as well.",7,,
134,0.97,1454.553,1459.724,Councilmember Herbold has not responded to the repeated requests for my office about whether she will accept the bill to refer to her committee or not.,7,,
135,0.97,1459.724,1473.905,"She is not present this morning and I am happy to talk to her office later today to find out if she is unable or unwilling to have this legislation . If so, I referred to my committee.",7,,
136,0.97,1473.905,1475.373,But I want to give her every opportunity to say she is interested.,7,,
137,0.97,1475.373,1487.385,"As soon as I legislation was ready for my office and I send it to Councilmember Lewis to ask if he wanted to cosponsor, he responded right away saying quote thank you for sending but not at this time.",7,,
138,0.97,1487.385,1492.591,Appreciate Councilmember Sawant leadership in this area.,7,,
139,0.97,1492.591,1503.768,We have not received responses from Councilmember Herbold to any inquiries despite my office attempting to call her staff 23 times last week.,7,,
140,0.97,1503.768,1516.615,"I will be contacting her and I would appreciate it if her office can respond to my office today without any further delays . whether her office will accept it . If they will, when will they approve the introduction?",7,,
141,0.97,1516.615,1522.32,We don't want delays . and instead should we referred to my committee?,7,,
142,0.97,1522.32,1531.763,Once the legislation is pet laced on the calendar it makes it available for the public to see and comment on . In my opinion that should happen without delay.,7,,
143,0.97,1531.763,1556.021,I joined other Councilmembers in signing the letter to the--asking them to renew the issue but I don't believe that should be used as an excuse to prevent everyone else from weighing in in the community and we know the introduction is a formal first step to open the democratic process.,7,,
144,0.97,1556.021,1560.725,I am particularly concerned about the delays because there are not many more committee meetings left before the budget begins.,7,,
145,0.97,1560.725,1575.14,"If the legislation is not introduced soon, it will be delayed until after budget which often means it will not be taken up this year and effectively we would need to restart the process next year.",7,,
146,0.97,1575.14,1601.666,As I have said again and again I am happy to discuss with the introduction of referral of the bill but I hope there will not be attempts to block the introduction before a public and Democratic discussion and debate happens . In Olympia progressive legislation is blocked every year by sending it to a hostile committee where it will die.,7,,
147,0.97,1601.666,1603.168,I urge Councilmembers to not establish that tradition in Seattle.,7,,
148,0.97,1603.168,1605.503,I apologize if my Audio was cutting out a bit.,7,,

154,0.97,1635.433,1639.938,We don't want to create any undue delay.,8,,
155,0.97,1639.938,1658.356,We want to follow through on the proper process and procedures .

182,0.97,1908.606,1921.419,On June 22 the United States Interior Secretary announced the Department of interior will conduct a nationwide search of Federal boarding schools for possible burial sites of native American children.,9,,

233,0.97,2276.54,2287.685,On Friday two people were hit by a train at a rail station.,13,,
234,0.97,2290.054,2298.162,We know most of the stations in the Rainier valley were constructed at grade and that leaves pedestrians at extreme risk when trying to cross both the tracks themselves and the major arterial of Martin King Jr. way.,13,,
235,0.97,2298.162,2304.001,Especially when there are no safety gates or any other kind of barrier to protect pedestrians.,13,,
236,0.97,2304.001,2307.104,I still don't know the names of the victims.,13,,
237,0.97,2307.104,2313.277,They were a 76-Year-Old woman and a 66-Year-Old man.,13,,
238,0.97,2313.277,2322.92,I want to let folks know that there are middle schools along the corridor on either side of the tracks.,13,,
239,0.97,2322.92,2336.434,"We've got students, Elders, people with mobility issues, who regularly cross these tracks and use their stations.",13,,
240,0.97,2336.434,2347.044,I have been in discussion with sound transit about the general safety needs in the Rainier Valley and this incident demonstrates how critical it is that the existing stations receive the investments and safety equipment that they should have received in the first place.,13,,
241,0.97,2347.044,2348.012,When the tracks were originally built.,13,,
242,0.97,2348.012,2374.472,"All of these issues were raised . and yet, they were constructed without any safety equipment in place . I office will continue to advocate for this and advocating with sound transit and some at the state level to make sure we have the funding to keep those measures in place.",13,,
243,0.97,2374.472,2380.878,"On this afternoon's calendar, I have no items from the community economic development committee.",13,,
244,0.97,2380.878,2381.779,"Our next meeting is Tuesday, July 20.",13,,
245,0.97,2381.779,2391.789,We do have a resolution that I am Cosponsoring with Councilmember Herbold to provide an honorary designation of South Hill Street between 21st and 22nd Avenue as Clarence Cox Jr. way.,13,,
246,0.97,2391.789,2398.062,Is Councilmember Peterson mentioned that will be in his committee tomorrow.,13,,
247,0.97,2398.062,2411.008,"Regarding departments, the equitable development initiative received 78 applications for funding . that round just closed.",13,,
248,0.97,2411.008,2415.913,There was about $15 million in asks.,13,,
249,0.97,2415.913,2416.714,Most of it for land acquisition.,13,,
250,0.97,2416.714,2420.918,There are only $6.8 million available.,13,,
251,0.97,2420.918,2428.425,I think it really demonstrates the huge demand for support in community led development projects in the city.,13,,
252,0.97,2428.425,2435.866,And are excited to know they did such a great job advertising the opportunity.,13,,
253,0.97,2435.866,2445.209,"Clearly, we need to acknowledge the demand and see what we can do to help support that more.",13,,
254,0.97,2445.209,2454.418,Edi is pulling together the review committee . There will be decisions at the end of August.,13,,
255,0.97,2454.418,2458.055,I think it was over 75% of the requests were for land acquisition.,13,,
256,0.97,2458.055,2467.598,The $6.8 million will fund the projecting may be between 7-10 projects.,13,,
257,0.97,2467.598,2470.835,"Additionally, in mid July applications are due for the strategic investment fund.",13,,
258,0.97,2470.835,2474.405,"And the Edi advisory board will meet next week, sorry, next month.",13,,
259,0.97,2474.405,2491.355,They have a retreat . This board is finally coming together and the hope was they would be seated in time to begin working together and discuss how they will be using Jumpstart money in addition to the other funding that is available.,13,,
260,0.97,2491.355,2527.558,"My understanding is that the Jumpstart funding is part of the first conversation . really there is huge demand for projects, support for community projects and because there is additional funding, there is also an interest in the parchment, in the division of additional staffing for contract management, community engagement specialist . part of the discussion will be how to address all of the needs and the Department.",13,,
261,0.97,2527.558,2537.635,Last week my staff and I met with outreach workers from reach and never care to help distribute water and supplies during the excessive heat on Monday.,13,,
262,0.97,2537.635,2548.379,"We met with several neighbors living at an encampment in Georgetown to continue to reiterate they need safe, Non- Congregants shelter.",13,,
263,0.97,2548.379,2549.78,Where they can be with their partners and with the community.,13,,
264,0.97,2549.78,2552.75,And that includes places for folks to live in their Rvs.,13,,
265,0.97,2552.75,2563.861,"And many people we met with last week were not in Rvs, they were living in a tent . I can tell you the heat from concrete or asphalt was really oppressive.",13,,
266,0.97,2563.861,2571.969,It is important that outreach workers were out in distributed water.,13,,
267,0.97,2571.969,2577.841,I want to thank all the outreach workers who were really working hard to try to keep people safe in the heat.,13,,
268,0.97,2577.841,2593.09,This week I will meet with the Cid public safety committee to talk about some issues in the Chinatown International district . that will be tomorrow afternoon.,13,,
269,0.97,2593.09,2595.626,My staff and I also continue to coordinate with members of the Mount Baker community who are very concerned about safety.,13,,
270,0.97,2595.626,2624.421,"As I mentioned last week, committee members are concerned following a shooting that happened . following that incident, we had a meeting with community members, with sound transit, other departments as well as a state Senator.",13,,
271,0.97,2624.421,2625.723,And at the meeting a member of the Mayor's staff was present.,13,,
272,0.97,2625.723,2626.557,I want to thank her for attending.,13,,
273,0.97,2626.557,2637.434,They did commit to holding a form with neighbors so the Mayor could hear firsthand from committee members about their concerns.,13,,
274,0.97,2637.434,2675.105,"I am looking forward to the response from the Mayor's office and at that meeting community members requested that a nearby parking lot, which is often used as a spot for drug dealing, that parking lot be made available to neighbors for their own parking needs so they don't have to park far away and walk through what has become a fairly dangerous space . The lot is part of the site that is held by the office of housing . My office has reached out to the office of housing so we can try to get the conversation started and see if there could be a temporary use while the project is in development.",13,,
275,0.97,2675.105,2682.146,I also toward the--site.,13,,
276,0.97,2682.146,2689.086,That is a site between the Stadium and the highway.,13,,
277,0.97,2689.086,2695.192,As you know there are lots of conversations happening around Maritime and industrial lands.,13,,
278,0.97,2695.192,2705.636,"Neighbors in Pioneer square interested in making sure that piece of property, that they are able to consider their own vision for what that might look like.",13,,
279,0.97,2705.636,2720.117,So we met with neighbors from Pioneer square and several folks from Washington Department of transportation to talk about their plans for creating a community engagement process of what that would look like.,13,,
280,0.97,2720.117,2749.012,"Neighbors also expressed a real interest--I should say a concern in their capacity . The Chinatown International district and the Pioneer square neighborhoods are about to embark on the EIS process for the sound transit, to figure out what the station location decision should be.",13,,
281,0.97,2749.012,2762.793,They are very invested in making sure that their capacity and energy can go toward having the kind of community influence in that process that they expect as residents and business owners of those neighborhoods.,13,,
282,0.97,2762.793,2782.78,There is also interest in not having a second EIS process happening at the same time . I have asked my office to begin conversations to try to see if there can be just a little bit of a delay in that EIS so they can do one thing at a time.,13,,
283,0.97,2782.78,2786.283,We will begin conversations about that as well.,13,,
284,0.97,2786.283,2791.989,I think that is it for me.,13,,
285,0.97,2791.989,2800.33,"My last request is that I would like to ask to be excused on Monday July 26 and Monday July 26 and Monday, August 16.",13,,

306,0.97,2882.913,2883.88,In anticipation of the 2021 bond proceeds.,20,,
307,0.97,2883.88,2887.885,This was before the 2021 adopted budget was presented and before decision to repair or replace the West Seattle bridge were made.,20,,
308,0.97,2887.885,2898.061,The 2021 adopted budget anticipated additional taxable bond sales for the overlook walk and Aquarium expansion projects and directed those proceeds to the same Fund.,20,,
309,0.97,2898.061,2911.441,Finance and administered of services Department has since determined that we can sell Nontaxable bonds for the West Seattle bridge repair at the bonds proceeds will need to be held in a separate Fund from the taxable bond.,20,,
310,0.97,2911.441,2918.148,"This legislation will do that and it will go straight to the Finance and housing, excuse me.",20,,
311,0.97,2918.148,2920.784,It will go straight to full council avoiding the Finance and housing committee.,20,,

317,0.97,2975.305,2981.244,This legislation would and hazard pay requirements and recognition of the considerable progress made toward supporting the health and security of front-line workers and communities that have high rates of Vaccinations and reduced the number of Covid-19 exposure and hospitalizations.,20,,
318,0.97,2981.244,2989.586,We did hear about the improved trends from the folks at the public health Seattle King County at our last meeting.,20,,
319,0.97,2989.586,3016.213,We did pass the hazard pay legislation . After seeing other cities across the West Coast take up similar legislation offering four dollars an hour extra pay requirement for frontline grocery store workers to have been risking their health and safety and the health and safety of their families by going to work during Covid.,20,,
320,0.97,3016.213,3018.715,We had a commitment and it legislation that we would Revisit it after four months.,20,,
321,0.97,3018.715,3024.821,And this legislation is that commitment coming around.,20,,
322,0.97,3024.821,3036.299,The legislation went into effect in February and after we heard from them in June we are moving forward with this legislation for your consideration.,20,,
323,0.97,3036.299,3056.386,"I want to underscore that if this bill is to pass the hazard pay requirements, specifically around four dollars, are not in effect but the rest of the hazard pay for grocery store employees would remain in effect that includes Recordkeeping requirements, prohibition against retaliation, prohibition against enforcement.",20,,
324,0.97,3056.386,3058.321,And would continue for three years after the original effective date of the legislation.,20,,
325,0.97,3058.321,3067.964,And then it would be Sunsetting after the three years without subsequent action by counsel.,20,,
326,0.97,3067.964,3098.829,I want to make sure folks know we did do outreach to the United Food and commercial local 21 and we also had members of the industry at our panel and folks are well aware that we also continue to call for greater protections for frontline workers overall as this legislation was intended to be temporary there is also ongoing concerns about the need for grocery workers who have access to equitable vaccines and public health measures and also to make sure their voices continue to be heard about safety concerns within grocery stores overall.,20,,
327,0.97,3098.829,3105.202,We look forward to supporting them in those endeavors that are ongoing.,20,,
328,0.97,3105.202,3109.973,The next piece of legislation is what I refer to as the Jumpstart Fund.,20,,
329,0.97,3109.973,3120.25,This is the Jumpstart Seattle fund created through counsel bill 120118 calling forward this legislation for this consideration.,20,,

332,0.97,3134.831,3157.888,"Who have noted the importance of the Jumpstart progressive tax legislation we passed last year which meant there was no budgetary layoffs, no drastic or draconian cuts to community services and we avoided austerity budgeting and meant we could use all the Federal dollars to invest in additive programs and additive support for the community instead of Backfilling holes like many cities are doing with their Federal funds.",20,,
333,0.97,3157.888,3169.666,"We also just recently had a court victory that had dismissed the charge against Jumpstart with prejudice, which means we are very excited to see this legislation continue to remain in law and are anticipating 2022 funds coming in.",20,,
334,0.97,3169.666,3200.263,"As you recall, in 2022 the spend plan we passed the resolution focuses on permanent funding strategies in housing, equitable development, green new deal and economic resilience sectors . All subsequent budget starting in 2022 really will have a chance for us to center those priorities in housing homelessness economic resilience and direct aid to make sure that we are investing in a more equitable economy as we seek to recover from Covid.",20,,
335,0.97,3200.263,3208.305,Is legislation in front of us also bill 120 120118 on Friday helps accomplish two goals.,20,,
336,0.97,3208.305,3217.314,The first is to create a more transparent and more accountability around the Jumpstart revenues that we will be receiving starting in 2022.,20,,
337,0.97,3217.314,3227.49,"To track exactly how much is expected to come in since our initial announcement, the projections and we would like to see what the actual revenue is starting in 2022.",20,,
338,0.97,3227.49,3241.705,The second thing will make good on the promises and commitments we made to the large coalition and community members who have been calling for Progressive taxes and specifically worked on creating the spend planned as detailed in the ordinance.,20,,
339,0.97,3241.705,3280.143,You will see that the legislation Codifies what we put into the resolution in the first place and is in line with our counsel's values around transparency and accountability Aligning the intent of the goals of the Stakeholder plan and the hundreds of Stakeholders who helped to build Jumpstart and we are excited about the legislation in terms of good Governance and accountability transparency measures and a way to make sure that we can follow through on those spend plan requirements that we put in the original package of legislation.,20,,
340,0.97,3280.143,3288.918,Ths also has a reference to the original Legislations Versight board which includes a committee to oversee the programs and services and funds of the tax we provided in last year's legislation.,20,,
341,0.97,3288.918,3310.507,"And it includes sound budgeting strategy by making sure there is a valve to recognize that if there is a revenue shortfall below our Pre-Covid baseline projections, we can potentially be flexible but the intent is to make sure we are adhering to the spend planned as originally codified in the legislation.",20,,
342,0.97,3310.507,3317.414,Those bills will be on the fan it's and housing committee agenda on Friday and we will have the South Park property acquisition legislation.,20,,

346,0.97,3342.972,3351.748,We do this through an amendment I sponsored in the administration and finance plan that we passed in 2019.,20,,
347,0.97,3351.748,3375.805,And we increase the office of housing ability to act quickly on this type of acquisition recognizing the more public property that we can acquire to create public goods like housing and ground space for child care and community centers is good for the entire community and especially during this competitive market that we have right now . It is important for the office of housing to have every tool in the tool kit.,20,,
348,0.97,3375.805,3385.682,"This was an increase we made two years ago after your support, lifted the calf to allow for the office of housing to have Rater acquisition authority in the future.",20,,

352,0.97,3404.734,3435.331,"There will be another piece of legislation coming to an my Committee in August that will implement other changes made to the program by the state Legislature that addresses a broader scope of issues . This legislation and Committee narrowly focuses on a small handful of projects that have been impacted by Covid and are expecting delays that necessitate extensions to their application windows . all this helps us move toward creating additional housing in our region, which is so desperately needed.",20,,
