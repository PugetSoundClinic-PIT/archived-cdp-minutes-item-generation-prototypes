41,0.97,275.575,276.042,Good morning.,7,,
42,0.97,276.109,277.243,My name's Steve Zemke.,7,,
43,0.97,277.31,284.617,I'm a former member of the Seattle urban forest Commission.,7,,
44,0.97,284.684,302.035,"Having served over six years . It's my opinion after being involved over 12 years and trying to work for an updated tree and urban forest protection ordinance, that the urban forest Commission has become in large part just another member of the public . It's mostly on the outside looking in.",7,,
45,0.97,302.101,309.242,"Two examples of this, one is the development of the urban forest management plan.",7,,
46,0.97,309.308,327.994,"The draft plan produced that mostly the commissioners had several talking sessions, but were not involved in writing or reviewing the draft prior to its release for public comment . The Commission reviewed the publicly released draft, and submitted comments like other members of the public.",7,,
47,0.97,328.061,333.399,And we do not know whether these will be incorporated in the final draft presented to you.,7,,
48,0.97,333.466,363.329,"The other is the confusion over what is happening with updating the urban forest tree protection ordinance, that it says in the work plan involved in the delivery of sessions in the tree and urban prediction ordinance with Sceo, and ose . There were no Deliberative sessions held in 2020 specifically relating to the draft tree ordinance.",7,,
49,0.97,363.396,370.002,"The Commission was involved in reviewing regulations, but not in discussing potential ordinance language.",7,,
50,0.97,370.069,381.214,And a note in the urban forest land management plan says Spci will be involved alone in the update of city tree regulations.,7,,
51,0.97,381.28,390.289,Nowhere is there a mention of the update of the ordinance . Nor does it mention that the urban forestry Commission has been involved.,7,,
52,0.97,390.356,393.86,So we think you need to be aware.,7,,
53,0.97,393.926,399.999,We think this is just more continuation of prolonging this process without action.,7,,
54,0.97,400.066,400.299,Thank you.,7,,
55,0.97,400.366,403.736,"Thank you, Steve.",8,,

58,0.97,429.262,431.197,Thank you for having me.,9,,
59,0.97,431.264,439.272,"Yonder cider had a small garage tasting room, out of my personal garage in the Phinney ridge neighborhood.",9,,
60,0.97,439.338,447.38,"We ended up closing on doors on February 15th, due to zoning issues.",9,,
61,0.97,447.446,506.339,"I'm call in support of the bill, because I want to emphasize what opening in our garage did for yonder cider . We had plans for a full tasting room when we began this process, but of course that was in January of last year, and the pandemic hit in March so all of our plans changed . being able to launch a brand, with no tasting room, and no retail presence is a challenge . by opening our business in our garage, we were able to kick start yonder and to grow its success from the ground up . before we opened, and slowly, but surely gained support of our neighborhood.",9,,
62,0.97,506.405,522.054,"We did announce about three or four weeks ago, that we were closing our doors, and have been working with zoning to try and find the solution, but the solution that was given did not make it able for us to continue staying open.",9,,
63,0.97,522.121,529.595,"We had to closure doors, but did receive 4200 signatures in support.",9,,
64,0.97,529.662,535.768,"What yonder cider has done, is provide a vibrant place for people to walk to during the pandemic.",9,,
65,0.97,535.835,546.379,"It's also provided a friendly neighborhood feeling, and it's provided yonder cider with the ability to succeed.",9,,
66,0.97,546.445,547.046,"Thank you, Caitlyn.",10,,
67,0.97,547.113,558.724,"If you would like to follow up with any more comments, feel free to Email us Dan Strauss @ Seattle.Gov.",10,,

71,0.97,575.274,592.191,"Again, I'm Jessica Dixon, I'm a volunteer with plant amnesty . I'm calling on the Council to upset the tree director's rule and tree ordinance.",11,,

74,0.97,612.745,621.053,"Seattle's current rules regarding tree removal have not been effective in identifying, and preserving trees.",11,,
75,0.97,621.12,631.43,"Where according to the 2016 study 72% of our trees are located, Seattle is rapidly losing its urban canopy.",11,,
76,0.97,631.497,652.818,"It is imperative that the Council pass not only an updated director's rule, but [inaudible] it balances tree preservation and growth with a net increase to reach the city's stated goal of 30% tree canopy.",11,,
77,0.97,652.885,674.306,"It is urgent that the Mayor and the city council act now to stop the loss of trees, particularly exceptional trees, heritage trees, and tree growth throughout the city, and to promote environmental equity . Thank you.",11,,

98,0.97,801.967,814.78,"We wanted before we go into the programs and the specifics of the living systems, which is our way of doing racial justice, talk about our Department first and then go into those slides.",23,,

100,0.97,815.714,854.687,"Our overall mission is to provide resources and opportunities for community members to build strong communities and to help neighbors develop a strong sense of place, build closer ties, and engage with the community and city government . The department currently is composed of over 60 staff members, a majority of people are of color, including 53% of our leadership, which is staffed with people of color . In order to achieve our leadership, we went through about an 18 month collaborative process with our staff to develop our two North Star goals.",23,,

105,0.97,905.871,936.635,"Two of which are the very important race equity tool kit around sound transit 3. and the West Seattle to Ballard Inc. and the Chinatown International district and little Saigon, racial equity took a hit . In 2021 we hope to adding to both of these around a racial equity tool kit related to the comprehensive plan.",23,,
106,0.97,936.702,936.935,Next slide.,23,,
107,0.97,937.002,947.579,So we're going to talk a little about our living systems . But just a few words to set up the context.,23,,
108,0.97,947.646,948.781,At D.O.N.,23,,
109,0.97,948.847,951.784,Our staff veered to measure the changing concept.,23,,

121,0.97,999.698,1001.7,"Hello, this is sunny.",24,,
122,0.97,1001.767,1040.406,"Like Andres said, the conception of the living system started a few years ago, as we moved away from the traditional change team model that a lot of departments still practice . people serve on terms on a Rotational basis, but it meant that a group of core people were in charge of intra departments with the living system's conception, everyone is involved, and is a leader around organizing racial injustice, and equity around the departments.",24,,
123,0.97,1040.472,1054.953,"The concept of the living system emphasizes a state of being, of an environment, and a culture in which we hope everyone is able to thrive and prosper.",24,,
124,0.97,1055.02,1068.2,"This is exemplified in our purpose, or our vision, which reads the healthy, whole, thriving living system results in a diverse people who are resilient.",24,,
125,0.97,1068.267,1072.237,"Full of energy, peace, compassion, and balance.",24,,
126,0.97,1072.304,1074.973,"Interdependent, and connected, and in community.",24,,
127,0.97,1075.04,1081.713,A place where there is movement and growth.,24,,
128,0.97,1081.78,1087.753,"In this living system, people feel loved, trusted, grateful, protected and safe.",24,,
129,0.97,1087.82,1091.723,"There is integrity, and vulnerability, and people are in relationship.",24,,
130,0.97,1091.79,1100.265,"In this living system, everyone is visible, and everyone is seen and heard.",24,,
131,0.97,1100.332,1113.812,This is the vision of the living system is quite vital to the work that we do at D.O.N . as it not only States we are here working at D.O.N.,24,,
132,0.97,1113.879,1117.416,But then there is a cultural environment.,24,,
133,0.97,1117.483,1140.239,"We recently felt this state was quite visionary, in a place that we wanted to aim for, or to try to get to, but yet, there are still structures of power in place that hinder us achieving 100% this state of being, or environment.",24,,
134,0.97,1140.305,1140.739,"Next slide, please.",24,,
135,0.97,1140.806,1168.634,"Our current organization, or Iteration of how we organize our living systems or the structures or spaces that we have in the departments neighborhoods are the learning community, hiring Redramatic, and Retension work group . that are effecting hiring lead balances.",24,,
136,0.97,1168.7,1171.236,Different policies that affect employees at dawn.,24,,
137,0.97,1171.303,1175.607,"Our new policy work group, which I'll speak on in just a bit.",24,,
138,0.97,1175.674,1189.221,"The network and peer support group, which we are sun setting, but the network is being accepted by these different work groups.",24,,
139,0.97,1189.288,1196.261,"Then two spaces for personal growth and for racial Caucusing, which are the White caucus and the people of color caucus.",24,,
140,0.97,1196.328,1208.507,"A new list work group is the policy work group, which is focused on two different things.",24,,
141,0.97,1208.574,1222.688,"One is space for people to bring problematic, or strategic changes to the program, and discuss if the program is working in the direction in terms of racial equity, someone that is bringing those changes to the group.",24,,
142,0.97,1222.754,1236.335,"It's also a space to break down and discuss and potentially influence the Department processes and practices, such as Formalizing relationships with other departments, budget, et cetera.",24,,
143,0.97,1236.401,1241.139,It sounds like the Councilmember had a question . pause real quick.,25,,
144,0.97,1241.206,1253.685,"Yeah, thank you, looking at your slide as compared to what you just reported, and great report, sunny, I really appreciate this.",26,,
145,0.97,1253.752,1265.23,The slide makes it look like the White caucus and people of color caucus are two separate entities.,26,,
146,0.97,1265.297,1270.369,"When you reported it, you made it clear these are two connected groups.",26,,
147,0.97,1270.435,1278.744,"Can you share briefly about why they're connected, and how they operate?",26,,
148,0.97,1278.81,1289.755,"As Andres said living system is quite interesting in the fact that people aren't just tied, or participating in one work group.",27,,
149,0.97,1289.821,1292.324,They're often part of all of the work groups.,27,,
150,0.97,1292.391,1300.932,They usually are part of one caucus group.,27,,
151,0.97,1300.999,1323.689,"So one of the four listed and then the caucus groups don't work outside of, although they're bullet pointed here as a separate work group, the work isn't separate necessarily from the other work groups.",27,,
152,0.97,1323.755,1340.172,So there are moments of time where the people of color caucus Collaborates particularly on departmental changes that affect communities at dawn.,27,,
153,0.97,1340.238,1360.592,"So that is one example of the way we are interconnected . Then one thing in our next slide, that I will speak more about, is the ways in which we envision bringing together our groups even more so.",27,,
154,0.97,1360.659,1371.069,"So the living systems 2021 goals, hopefully this answers your question, is to build white caucus accountability to the people of color in the departments.",27,,
155,0.97,1371.136,1384.583,This was largely coming from the White caucus itself to ensure that our personal growth goals were aligned.,27,,

311,0.97,2708.839,2714.611,"This is our mission to speak, not wholly different than most boards and commissions.",59,,
312,0.97,2714.678,2720.584,We were here to advise you all and the Mayor.,59,,
313,0.97,2720.651,2729.96,What I think is important that we acknowledge right now when talking about our mission is why trees.,59,,
314,0.97,2730.027,2739.903,"I know you are dealing with a lot of really, really critical information.",59,,
315,0.97,2739.97,2746.777,Why do we speed some time talking about trees and vegetation?,59,,
316,0.97,2746.844,2749.58,And I think There's a variety of reasons.,59,,
317,0.97,2749.646,2751.615,I think it helps center our consideration for today.,59,,
318,0.97,2751.682,2764.528,"We heard about some of the them at public comment early on . But trees are critical for things like our air pollution, which we know for Covid.",59,,
319,0.97,2764.595,2774.771,Trees are a critical element in combating climate change . trees are a critical element in saving Puget sound.,59,,
320,0.97,2774.838,2785.149,Trees are a critical element in the billions of dollars we're sinking into gray infrastructure.,59,,
321,0.97,2785.215,2806.77,"And all those things, we also have to realize that they appreciate in value overtime . Unlike our gray infrastructure, when we plant trees, they gain valuable each year that passes . A 100-Year-Old is dramatically more valuable than a 10-Year- old.",59,,
322,0.97,2806.837,2834.798,"We can't really say that about our pipes, our pavement, or water and even our lawns . next slide please, actually, I'll also say on that point, Councilmember Strauss, I really enjoyed your phrase that we're going to steward our land as guests.",59,,
323,0.97,2834.865,2840.07,What we're talking about today is very much that as well.,59,,
324,0.97,2840.137,2852.616,Credit is due to Councilmember Juarez who has taught me well.,60,,
325,0.97,2852.683,2854.384,"Thank you, Juarez.",61,,
326,0.97,2854.451,2866.763,"For our 2020 objectives, which is what we're looking at here, were pretty varied and all quite important items.",61,,
327,0.97,2866.83,2874.871,"I think as years have past, we've seen more and more of a flurry of activity, and really impact.",61,,
328,0.97,2874.938,2875.973,Activity from the forest Commission.,61,,
329,0.97,2876.039,2882.045,"I would point out, that you know, as we said 2020 was an unusual year.",61,,
330,0.97,2882.112,2898.695,"We as a Commission were acknowledging the need to deal with Covid as kind of the preeminent crisis, but also that we were facing a crisis within the city and racing social justice.",61,,
331,0.97,2898.762,2906.536,"And systemic racism that was part of the city, and the Commission as part of the city, we needed to address that as well.",61,,
332,0.97,2906.603,2922.019,"So we took on these two new crises in addition to our existing ones of climate change and homelessness, both of which have dramatic impacts of legislation, and tried to build a work plan for 2020 that addressed those things.",61,,
333,0.97,2922.085,2943.106,"And the key item that touches across all of this, and it's the most important thing that we'll keep hammering home today is updating the urban forestry tree protection ordinance . This is an item, that you know, I get to now say close to 12 years in the process.",61,,
334,0.97,2943.173,2953.317,"2009, we had what at the time was deemed an internal movement, is still on the books, and we know it's Affective.",61,,
335,0.97,2953.383,2964.928,"We are now working from Council resolution as you see there, 31902, which was passed at the very end of 2019.",61,,
336,0.97,2964.995,2965.896,"By then, Councilmember Bagshaw's lead.",61,,
337,0.97,2965.962,2976.239,"It acknowledged a lot of things that were already put forth in the executive order, and to the Commission, essentially really simple Fied the equation for us.",61,,
338,0.97,2976.306,2983.914,"We have agreement from Council, and the executive on the items that the ordinance needs to have.",61,,
339,0.97,2983.98,2986.216,Staff has put in the time . We need to implement.,61,,
340,0.97,2986.283,2996.026,"The next big item from last year was updating the urban forestry management plan . This is again, kind of a multiyear process.",61,,
341,0.97,2996.093,2999.196,We'll touch on more of that in a minute.,61,,
342,0.97,2999.262,3004.468,Digging into more about our urban forestry funding.,61,,
343,0.97,3004.534,3024.521,"Then as I said, looking at how do we make changes on the Commission side when it comes to social justice inclusion, in terms of the impacts of our work.",61,,
344,0.97,3024.588,3025.055,"The next slide, please.",61,,
345,0.97,3025.122,3037.734,"I'm going to talk a little here about the tree protection ordinance, and then I'm going to pass off to Sarah to discuss some of our other work from 2020.",61,,
346,0.97,3037.801,3042.973,"Briefly, I'll just say, again, we're going on 12 years.",61,,
347,0.97,3043.039,3072.302,"You see here seven key recommendations these, I think are no longer controversial . We have distilled, we've discussed, and as I've said before we've seen these repeated in counsel resolution . We've seen them in executive order.",61,,
348,0.97,3072.369,3091.254,"It's time to take action . There is, I think a lot of baggage with tree protection . I think we just need to take action, and embrace that conflict, and manage for it . You know, we can't ignore it and throw our hands up and say this is too difficult.",61,,
349,0.97,3091.321,3100.53,"We know that we have a limited amount of space in the city, and we know we need to manage for it.",61,,
350,0.97,3100.597,3101.298,We do this well.,61,,
351,0.97,3101.364,3124.688,"Something like right of way . We know we need a bike Lane, and a street Lane, and trees . We can be doing that with our private property as well . We can be doing that in a number of ways to accommodate.",61,,
352,0.97,3124.754,3126.99,I think that's said.,62,,
353,0.97,3127.057,3131.261,One of the points we need to be better managing our Street trees as well.,62,,
354,0.97,3131.328,3150.08,"One of the points of conflict that I have noticed on private property is with people who are building new buildings on private property, there are not the incentives that we need to have to preserve the trees that are existing.",62,,
355,0.97,3150.146,3159.256,"I have seen some really great new, I don't like the aesthetics of Townhomes.",62,,
356,0.97,3159.322,3174.337,"I do like the density they provide, and the Townhomes that have embraced trees on their lots, make the lot feel as if it's always been there, because that tree is providing, as you say, value that is only additive, every year that that tree is alive.",62,,
357,0.97,3174.404,3195.058,"So one of the things I've noticed is really the need to allow for greater flexibility for people building buildings when trees are preserved . whether it's, you know, set back flex ability, height flexibility.",62,,
358,0.97,3195.125,3209.94,There's been too many times that our code has been interest restrictive with people building buildings when they want to save these trees as well.,62,,
359,0.97,3210.006,3211.975,"We need to have more options, right?",63,,
360,0.97,3212.042,3222.385,"We need to have more ways in which we can get trees onto property, and we need to provide more incentives, more flexibility.",63,,
361,0.97,3222.452,3228.191,Those are things we provide for other common goods we hope are provided.,63,,
362,0.97,3228.258,3231.795,We should have those available for trees as well.,63,,
363,0.97,3231.861,3235.699,And thank you for your point about preservation.,63,,
364,0.97,3235.765,3243.306,Maintaining is tree is always more effective than starting from scratch.,63,,
365,0.97,3243.373,3265.028,"I want to say 61St in Ballard, they preserved the tree, they were able to build the building in an L shape around it, and it makes the building feel that it's always been there in a way that couldn't have been accomplished without preserving that tree . whereas two blocks north of there, on I believe it was 63Rd.",64,,
366,0.97,3265.095,3270.8,Two blocks North and one block West.,64,,
367,0.97,3270.867,3278.308,"63Rd and 22nd, they cut down all of the trees that were there.",64,,
368,0.97,3278.375,3283.346,"It just, it doesn't have that feeling as if people have always been there.",64,,
369,0.97,3283.413,3286.683,"Yeah, development.",65,,
370,0.97,3286.75,3287.784,We know Development'S going to take place.,65,,
371,0.97,3287.851,3290.153,How do we make sure that it works for everybody?,65,,
372,0.97,3290.22,3291.788,Trees are a big part of that.,65,,
373,0.97,3291.855,3310.173,"Because need to have there is an environmental reason for having people in an environmental dense area, preserving land in the foothills and outskirts of town by having more people here.",66,,
374,0.97,3310.24,3324.02,"I think New York City has one of the better ratios of impact of people to land, because they have people in a really dense situation now.",66,,
375,0.97,3324.087,3354.451,"Again, I'm not arguing for Ballard to become New York City, what I am saying is when we have people living in a less environmental impact, there's a way to preserve the impact . and providing greater flexibility for people building that density that we need to go have their crate the density, and preserve the trees.",66,,
376,0.97,3354.517,3361.825,Bringing up cities is important here.,67,,
377,0.97,3361.891,3368.231,The strong tree protection ordinances we see are associated with cities with strong growth.,67,,
378,0.97,3368.298,3387.35,"For instance, a city like Austin has one of the strongest tree protection ordinances . Our peer cities, if you look at Portland, have very strong tree protection ordinances.",67,,
379,0.97,3387.417,3391.354,It's something we would want to pair with growth.,67,,
380,0.97,3391.421,3395.792,"Just like anything else, where we're considering impacts, state benefits.",67,,
381,0.97,3395.859,3406.236,"We need to be looking at the broader picture when we have these kinds of large changes . next slide, please.",67,,
382,0.97,3406.302,3417.814,"So this is kind of just getting at some of the ways that we, from our end have been tackling this.",67,,
383,0.97,3417.881,3422.118,We know staff is working on it to some extent.,67,,
384,0.97,3422.185,3438.868,"We've developed a one Pager to distill this complex of an ordinance, to something that's Digestic for a public audience . We've received a lot of public input.",67,,
385,0.97,3438.935,3442.305,"These are things we'll want to talk about, we'll talk about 2021.",67,,
386,0.97,3442.372,3452.482,To drive home one last point on the tree protection ordinance . why this is needed.,67,,
387,0.97,3452.549,3453.483,We don't have data.,67,,
388,0.97,3453.55,3459.622,We can't make good policy for our trees and vegetation unless we have information to make policy.,67,,
389,0.97,3459.689,3469.532,We don't know necessarily what activities are causing to the most tree loss.,67,,
390,0.97,3469.599,3472.202,We did know that we're losing our big trees.,67,,
391,0.97,3472.268,3488.451,"Some of our most important trees, around we're losing some canopy cover Overtile.",67,,
392,0.97,3488.518,3490.42,"But generally, we don't don't know.",67,,
393,0.97,3490.486,3498.261,We permit things that are important.,67,,
394,0.97,3498.328,3514.878,"Weinvent Adviseincentivize things that are important . So we should be permitting, and regulating the things that actually benefit our neighbors, actually benefit the broader community.",67,,
395,0.97,3514.944,3518.848,That's where the incentives Ned to be.,67,,
396,0.97,3518.915,3540.169,"One more point, we need a process that has clear rules . We want our trees to be things that we know what we're supposed to do, and we know how to handle it, and we know how to get the most benefits . right now, far to much of our tree issues are handled with the city attorney involved . We need to have rules.",67,,
397,0.97,3540.236,3542.639,Have everyone decide what we're going to do.,67,,
398,0.97,3542.705,3549.879,"Have developers understand the rules, and abide by them, and we want to provide a clear and logical process.",67,,
399,0.97,3549.946,3602.932,"I was just your point about code regulation, and permitting . We just passed the strongest energy code in the nation a few weeks ago, something that comes in front of mind, I'm just going to keep focusing on this Townhome or tree Association . any building that has a mature canopy over or around it is going to use fewer resources to heat and cool the property . I'm Riffing off of your comments, that we have these codes that determine how we use our energy, and we could be using less energy with canopy cover.",68,,
400,0.97,3602.999,3603.232,Exactly.,69,,
401,0.97,3603.299,3623.386,We know that our drainage rate incorporates impervious cover . We could be Insentivizing trees and legislation.,69,,
402,0.97,3623.453,3650.446,You have a tree sandy from Greenlake takes it upon herself to go to the neighbors of Newtown new Townhomes who have just moved in to help education them on how to make sure their tree grows and thieves.,70,,
403,0.97,3650.513,3662.759,"She has keyed into a gap that we have, when people are purchasing Townhomes, it may be their first home, and maybe they've never had the opportunity to care for a tree in their yard.",70,,
404,0.97,3662.825,3675.138,"If you don't know that you have to water the tree, then you might not water it, and that could be the difference between success and failure in this situation.",70,,
405,0.97,3675.204,3684.881,"I know in last fall's budget session, produced a statement of legislative intent to identify ways we can expand the tree Ambassador program.",70,,
406,0.97,3684.947,3701.898,"So maybe not now, but we would love your input on how we could expand had a tree Ambassador program, to allow everyday people to have more tools to care for the trees in their neighborhood.",70,,
407,0.97,3701.964,3702.799,Excellent.,71,,
408,0.97,3702.865,3702.999,Yeah.,71,,
409,0.97,3703.066,3709.972,"It's a tremendous program, as you point out.",71,,
410,0.97,3710.039,3712.742,Kind of a key component.,71,,
411,0.97,3712.809,3716.546,Thank you for your an he can doubt.,71,,
412,0.97,3716.612,3722.919,"We have a tremendous amount who are passionate, and deeply engaged.",71,,
413,0.97,3722.985,3736.065,"I think it's part of our mission to expand our community, and to bring in who haven't been part of the conversation.",71,,
414,0.97,3736.132,3750.813,"That means also perhaps business interests, development interests, and those who are huge Stakeholders, about often aren't at the table for the conversations.",71,,
415,0.97,3750.88,3763.192,"With that, I'm going to pass over to Sarah to kind of talk a bit more about our items we were looking at last year.",71,,
416,0.97,3763.259,3763.559,Thank you.,72,,
417,0.97,3763.626,3783.479,"What is shown on the slide are some of the key conversations we were a part of with the different either city Department, or different letters that we sent out for in support.",72,,
418,0.97,3783.546,3787.016,So for safe routes to school for s DOT's program.,72,,
419,0.97,3787.083,3798.194,One thing was that they really highlighted how they're utilizing trees to provide a better walking environment for the students.,72,,
420,0.97,3798.261,3818.881,"And then also using the trees to help reduce vehicular speeds on the adjacent roadways . so that was great to here, that they are using trees to be able to meet their goals for providing safe routes to school.",72,,
421,0.97,3818.948,3821.384,For the Spu's ship Canal water quality project.,72,,
422,0.97,3821.45,3839.535,"One of the big things was there were tree Removals as part of the project, and with the city's two for one replacement, one of the challenges was finding where to place the replacement trees, or plant the replacement trees.",72,,
423,0.97,3839.602,3846.442,So working with the Spu on looking at trying to keep the tree Replantings in the neighborhood.,72,,
424,0.97,3846.509,3858.588,"They are removed from, and if they can't, where to Prioritize replanting the trees.",72,,
425,0.97,3858.654,3862.558,"For the navigation team, the presentation was early of the year.",72,,
426,0.97,3862.625,3869.966,"And really, we were setting up to discuss the Multidepartmental rules.",72,,
427,0.97,3870.032,3938.801,"But due to Covid, that went out the window, and so, really it was trying to, the Coronavirus was mostly about how they really needed to pivot to address the Covid crisis . and one of the big Takeaways though, was from that we were wanting to be a part of the conversation is that we are seeing how Encampments in our tree areas is starting to have a more negative connotation for tree areas in Seattle, so we're wanting to make sure we understand the public opinion, and also the challenges of trying to house our Unhoused population, and make sure that we can find a way to help Prioritize the efforts, to protect the investment of our urban forest.",72,,
428,0.97,3938.868,3970.299,"For the green new deal, again they were beginning to staff the positions, but due to Covid had to really, it was a big challenge to continue that work, but we're very excited about the possibilities of the green new deal in helping us be better stewards for our urban forests and what kind of job creation this can bring to the city.",72,,
429,0.97,3970.366,4021.917,"With the black lives matter statement of support, I wanted to acknowledge that the canopy cover within our communities of our Bipop communities is a lot lower than other neighborhoods . So we see the inequities within our built environment, and want to try to make sure as a part of the city as Weston said, we are acknowledging that, and working on how to remove the address the racism that has been kind of institutionalized through our processes.",72,,
430,0.97,4021.984,4022.518,Sdot passed readiness.,72,,
431,0.97,4022.585,4062.658,"One of the big things that came out from this briefing was that they haven't yet really been able to get Sdci Onboard at the time of the briefing, so things might have changed, but with over 70% of the tree canopy on private property, the urban forest Commission felt that it was very important to get Sdci Onboard to be able to address any threat we have of pests coming into the community . into our city.",72,,
432,0.97,4062.725,4074.837,Another thing with this is also part of their Sdot'S Self- evaluation was they acknowledged they don't have information.,72,,
433,0.97,4074.904,4081.777,"They again, to Weston's point, we need to know what we have in order to manage it.",72,,
434,0.97,4081.844,4106.101,"And we are looking to the ordinance changes to help fill in some of these gaps, and you know, just wanted to highlight another place, where we're seeing this lack of information Impacting the ability of the city to meet these goals.",72,,
435,0.97,4106.168,4106.469,Jumping in.,73,,
436,0.97,4106.535,4114.21,"When you say pests, we're not talking about rodents and mice, we're talking about the tree ash beetle.",73,,
437,0.97,4114.276,4125.988,"Yes, yes, that is we're not talking about what you think about as like the rats and everything in our city.",74,,
438,0.97,4126.055,4177.54,"But more the threats the urban forest, where, I can't remember how many years ago, sorry, I apologize, I'm a Hydrologist, so I might not be using the right terms, but as far as bringing in the different diseases, and different bugs that will wipe out set species . and one of the things is we have a ton of maple trees . and if there's a threat to Maple trees, we could easily use a lot of our urban forest . and so trying to understand how much of what type of urban forest we have is very important to understand how we need to respond.",74,,
439,0.97,4177.606,4201.297,"And again, it's a Multidepartmental attempt, but one of the gaps was including, getting Sdci more integrated, and we're concerned, because so much of the urban forest canopy is, on private property.",74,,
440,0.97,4201.363,4204.967,So as this for the?,75,,
441,0.97,4205.034,4217.713,"But this is a regional effort, Seattle parks and recreation, and Seattle forestry, other Democratics are very much involved.",75,,
442,0.97,4217.78,4246.842,"I also wanted to point out that this kind of issue, is another one of the Fallouts of climate change, where we're having drier and hotter summers, which tend to place an impact on the health of the trees, and when they are kind of weakened by ongoing drought, then it's easier that they are invaded, and succumb to pests like the Emerald dashboard.",75,,
443,0.97,4246.909,4270.499,"It was Theinventory, and they have a great accounting of how many of the trees are ashes . and how many are potentially going to be lost, once the Emerald ash bore gets here . So all of this planning is regional, and the city's effort is leading that.",75,,
444,0.97,4270.566,4297.926,"Thank you, I'll do a real quick point . I guess I'm seeing we're getting closer to time for the urban forest management update . one of the things in the draft we commented on was a lot of the narrative of tree versus development versus you know, Densification.",76,,
445,0.97,4297.993,4308.47,So trying to break that narrative up in like South Lake Union has gone through a ton of development.,76,,
446,0.97,4308.537,4311.807,And its tree canopy has been increased.,76,,
447,0.97,4311.874,4329.191,So one of the things is just trying to breakdown that narrative to be more specific and define the terms that we really want to acknowledge are creating the friction of preserving our trees.,76,,
448,0.97,4329.258,4329.925,"Next slide, please.",76,,
449,0.97,4329.992,4335.264,"If I may, just really quickly, I just would like to respond to what I heard in public comment.",77,,
450,0.97,4335.33,4346.942,"Just wanted to clarify that as part of the work that the urban forestry team has done, we have included, and I'm speaking now as part of the urban forestry court team.",77,,
451,0.97,4347.009,4352.881,We included the urban forestry team in keep waste.,77,,
452,0.97,4352.948,4367.463,"In 2018, when we were just getting going with the planning update, we held a listening session in July to make sure we understood the Commission's vision for the update.",77,,
453,0.97,4367.529,4371.233,Then we held two different Deliberative sessions to be able to share with the Commission.,77,,
454,0.97,4371.3,4377.039,"One was in March, and the other in August of 2019.",77,,
455,0.97,4377.106,4386.582,"But we shared with this smaller Subeconomy, the initial finding we had.",77,,
456,0.97,4386.648,4397.493,We shared a potential planned structure as well as initial goals to be discussed and for the Commission to have the opportunity to weigh in.,77,,
457,0.97,4397.559,4407.536,"Then we also shared later in 2019, the progress that we were achieving specific actions performance Indicaters.",77,,
458,0.97,4407.603,4423.051,"All of these to be able to inform the work that the team was doing to update the plan . In 2020, we kicked off the public comment period with a briefing in detail to the Commission in October.",77,,
459,0.97,4423.118,4458.32,"So I just wanted to say, finding creative ways to Engain the Commission, without having to have big, elaborate public meetings, but really get their key experience in all of the skills that they bring to the table, that's why we've been having these Deliberative sessions, and for sure, I personally don't believe we are considering the Commission just another member of the public.",77,,
460,0.97,4458.387,4463.525,Well said.,78,,
461,0.97,4463.592,4463.959,"Thanks, Sandra.",79,,
462,0.97,4464.026,4477.406,"I want to just, with interest in time, highlight the forest health watch project, and I see tree.",79,,
463,0.97,4477.472,4510.405,"Those two organizations are utilizing, or are using web platforms to engage youth and public in research and in education, and we found that very encouraging to try to instill the appreciation for our urban forest and nature in the community.",79,,
464,0.97,4510.472,4510.739,Next slide.,79,,
465,0.97,4510.806,4578.273,"For our internal operations, we again, just want to highlight that one of the things we were doing by reevaluating our bylaws, different protocols was to make Surewe we restrict out any restrictive language, any gender pronouns and also we wanted to make sure in the Prompters, and to ourselves, we took a minute to make sure we looked at different conversations through the race and social justice lens, so we whether that into our bimonthly meetings, and all the different coordination we have with the partners.",79,,
466,0.97,4578.34,4602.03,"That also tied in with UFC and Idt team, where we participated in training on racial equity, and the urban forest, and that also went into how to reevaluate how we are providing material to the public and making sure that it is as accessible as possible.",79,,
467,0.97,4602.097,4604.466,Thank you.,79,,

475,0.97,4639.368,4647.676,"And this is focused on restructuring urban forestry management within the city . Obviously a very, very big issue.",80,,
476,0.97,4647.743,4672.768,"As you know currently nine departments work on trees and vegetation in this city, and and auditor report almost a decade ago, showed there is perhaps some efficiencies in management that we could be capitalizing on if thing were restructured.",80,,
477,0.97,4672.834,4688.383,"A lot of this is tied up in issues of regulation, and how do we most Affectively get to those.",80,,
478,0.97,4688.45,4693.755,So engaging with staff on the sly is a big part of our upcoming year.,80,,

531,0.97,5096.191,5148.61,"What's proposed to change and what the next steps are associated with the bill with effective purpose, and these are stated in the findings of fact, which are at the beginning of the bill, as the Councilmember knows, Councilmembers know, when the Council next enter regulations, you can find these to support those interim regulations . But they are Covid related . They would allow home based businesses, including those that once would have operated out of a brick and mortar location, to hopefully will allow small businesses to remain operating to speed economic recovery after the civil emergency restrictions are lifted, and businesses are cop rate more freely.",91,,
532,0.97,5148.676,5155.049,So how does the land use code currently regulate home occupations?,91,,
533,0.97,5155.116,5167.795,"Currently, an accessory use to a residential use in all zones . So there's not a Zonal restriction on where home occupations can be located . they can be in single family zones, multifamily zones, commercial zones.",91,,

535,0.97,5175.87,5191.753,Somebody could not lease out their garage to somebody else . You don't have to have a permit to have a home use occupation . You just need to comply with operating requirements.,91,,

540,0.97,5220.214,5223.017,The home occupation can't increase traffic.,91,,
541,0.97,5223.084,5235.93,The home occupations can is have signs but they are pretty small in size.,91,,
542,0.97,5235.997,5244.172,"Outdoor storage, and noise, odor, dust, those are not allowed to be associated with home occupations.",91,,
543,0.97,5244.238,5248.242,Do you guys have any questions about what the current regulations are?,91,,
544,0.97,5248.309,5254.749,Not so far from I've been well versed in all of this.,92,,
545,0.97,5254.816,5264.926,But opening it up to all colleagues.,92,,
546,0.97,5264.993,5265.293,Any questions?,92,,
547,0.97,5265.36,5265.793,Councilmember Peterson.,92,,
548,0.97,5265.86,5266.828,Not yet.,93,,
549,0.97,5266.894,5268.262,I'll keep going here.,94,,
550,0.97,5268.329,5276.17,"So what would interim basis, that is one year.",95,,
551,0.97,5276.237,5285.546,Homeowners would not be subject to the number of employees . and preliminary Taigses on increased traffic and parking would not apply to home based businesses.,95,,
552,0.97,5285.613,5289.25,I omitted something from this slide.,95,,
553,0.97,5289.317,5291.853,Apologies tore that.,95,,
554,0.97,5291.919,5302.33,"But also as drafted and introduced, the requirement that a home based basis that the structure of the home based business would also be modified as well.",95,,
555,0.97,5302.397,5310.071,"Additionally, home occupants would be allowed to have a larger sign.",95,,
556,0.97,5310.138,5330.358,"For those of you who are been in city hall, or are sitting at your desk at City Hall right now, the standard size of a stand up city desk is about twice 720 inches.",95,,
557,0.97,5330.425,5336.731,"And finally, spaces that may be occupied by required parking could be used for the home occupation.",95,,
558,0.97,5336.798,5351.446,"If you have a garage that satisfies the requirement for a required parking space, you could use your garage for your home based business.",95,,
559,0.97,5351.512,5351.813,So next steps.,95,,
560,0.97,5351.879,5356.751,"As I mentioned, this would be authorized as interim development controls.",95,,
561,0.97,5356.818,5367.495,That means that the Council still needs to hold a public hearing on the bill.,95,,
562,0.97,5367.562,5376.704,"There's a committee meeting scheduled for March 12th . Assuming the Council APPROVES that bill, that hearing would be after legislation.",95,,
563,0.97,5376.771,5382.643,"The bill does require a work program, and instructions to propose permanent changes to home occupations.",95,,
564,0.97,5382.71,5393.087,"Those could just be a refresh of our current regulations, or they could be something broader, depending on where we are with the Covid civil emergency about a year from now.",95,,
565,0.97,5393.154,5395.022,So that is my brief on the bill.,95,,
566,0.97,5395.089,5401.229,I'm happy to answer questions that you guys might have.,95,,
567,0.97,5401.295,5405.266,I have a few.,96,,

569,0.97,5406.601,5406.901,Take it away.,96,,
570,0.97,5406.968,5413.307,I think Councilmember Pedersen was ahead of me . is this the time?,97,,
571,0.97,5413.374,5413.808,Councilmember Pedersen?,97,,
572,0.97,5413.875,5417.879,"Please, go ahead.",98,,

575,0.97,5419.213,5419.413,Okay.,101,,
576,0.97,5419.48,5425.086,Is this the point where we have a bunch of questions now about this whole thing?,101,,
577,0.97,5425.153,5425.987,Is there more to come?,101,,
578,0.97,5426.053,5428.422,"This is, Okay, good.",101,,
579,0.97,5428.489,5434.095,"I think that is, slide says questions.",102,,
580,0.97,5434.162,5434.362,Okay.,103,,
581,0.97,5434.428,5436.664,So I'm going to be just real Frank.,103,,
582,0.97,5436.731,5438.065,"As it stands, I cannot support this.",103,,
583,0.97,5438.132,5448.209,"Let me just tell you why, and I know we're going to have a hearing, and clear going to clean it up, and do more . I understand the intent and the spirit and the passion.",103,,
584,0.97,5448.276,5448.509,I get it.,103,,
585,0.97,5448.576,5463.925,"So number one, I have three questions, and then you can answer or not question, and then as Councilmember Herbold says put a pin in it.",103,,
586,0.97,5463.991,5465.793,You have it as Covid-19 civil emergency.,103,,
587,0.97,5465.86,5468.095,We don't know how long that could be.,103,,
588,0.97,5468.162,5470.498,"That could be months, that could be years.",103,,
589,0.97,5470.565,5485.079,"I'm concerned about that . I am concerned about, I understand the desire to protect existing small, and Micro-Businesses, but this would also create more small and Micro businesses out of people's garages.",103,,
590,0.97,5485.146,5488.049,"If that's the case, which is fine.",103,,
591,0.97,5488.115,5498.526,"My concern is, what would be this impact to the existing small businesses when it comes to parking, competition.",103,,
592,0.97,5498.593,5506.267,And also in light of the fact that we're encouraging people not to use third party Apps for delivery.,103,,
593,0.97,5506.334,5512.373,"So small businesses and restaurants get 100% of the cost of the revenue, instead of just 85.",103,,
594,0.97,5512.44,5520.448,So I'm concerned about those small businesses on Spines like Aurora Lake City way.,103,,
595,0.97,5520.514,5520.681,Balard.,103,,
596,0.97,5520.748,5532.193,"If you have businesses operating out of your driveway, and we don't know for how long, as long as Covid-19 is going to be around, where there's more Signage, more parking.",103,,
597,0.97,5532.26,5538.199,You could have as many employees as you want.,103,,
598,0.97,5538.266,5546.173,"This could go from operating selling cider, to being a Masseuse to, does this mean, as I told my husband on the phone an hour ago.",103,,
599,0.97,5546.24,5550.945,"I said good news, I can open up the driveway and sell fried bread.",103,,
600,0.97,5551.012,5575.202,"Does that mean I can just open a business in my driveway, if this were to pass as is, for as long as Covid is around, to compete with all the small businesses and restaurants four blocks away with none of the constraints of regulation permitting, all the things that small businesses have to comply with for parking employees? all of those things?",103,,
601,0.97,5575.269,5589.951,"Seems to me that we may be creating an unfair playing field for those existing small businesses that we Ared in trying to protect, and keep open, as you've done, Councilmember Strauss, to your credit.",103,,
602,0.97,5590.017,5596.424,"Making sure that our sidewalks could be open, so small businesses could see people outside, and have coffee outside.",103,,
603,0.97,5596.49,5609.804,"Does this mean that I can open up an Espresso stand in my driveway, and sell Lattes to all my neighbors, while coffee Klatch four blocks away isn't going to get their business anymore?",103,,
604,0.97,5609.87,5613.674,This is the kind of stuff I'm concerned about.,103,,
605,0.97,5613.741,5620.147,"I am supportive of the intent, but the application, where we get a little Wonky, is where I get concerned.",103,,
606,0.97,5620.214,5623.217,So I'm going to be quiet after this.,103,,
607,0.97,5623.284,5626.554,Councilmember it.,104,,
608,0.97,5626.62,5639.533,"You always bring the best questions, and you nailed something that is important to me as well, which is we're not moving our business areas out into our neighborhoods.",104,,
609,0.97,5639.6,5652.313,"You would not be able to operate fried bread or coffee out of your driveway, you would be able to operate out of your garage.",104,,
610,0.97,5652.38,5654.915,It doesn't change the intent you share.,104,,
611,0.97,5654.982,5659.787,I'd definitely in my garage then.,105,,
612,0.97,5659.854,5662.156,My two car garage.,105,,
613,0.97,5662.223,5671.665,"My huge two car garage, and driveway is huge, so great, I can sell fried bread and fireworks.",105,,
614,0.97,5671.732,5671.966,Thank you.,105,,
615,0.97,5672.033,5672.233,Yes.,106,,
616,0.97,5672.299,5685.646,"To your point about making sure that we're not creating an uneven playing field about what other levels of government are regulating, whether it's Department of health, or liquor control board.",106,,
617,0.97,5685.713,5690.384,These other levels of government still have their jurisdiction.,106,,
618,0.97,5690.451,5699.26,"So to your point of, you know, to do fried bread, you would have to have a commercial Kichen.",106,,
619,0.97,5699.326,5713.174,"And so that just as it stands, the incentive would still be for, there are already existing kitchens that you could rent for cheaper than you could build in your garage.",106,,
620,0.97,5713.24,5713.841,There's really a lot.,106,,
621,0.97,5713.908,5722.95,"The intent here is to help create the code changes for existing, for what is already existing.",106,,
622,0.97,5723.017,5749.41,"And the interim, and correct me if I'm wrong, if is for one year, rather than for the duration of the Covid pandemic? I know we had initially talked about the Covid pandemic, but to your point, Councilwoman Juarez, we wanted to create a set Timeline for this interim measure, so that we could create, to take the time and process for any permanent changes to occur in a thoughtful way.",106,,
623,0.97,5749.477,5751.645,Do you want to correct me if I'm wrong?,106,,
624,0.97,5751.712,5759.12,"Yeah, I can speak inter Im here has a specific meaning.",107,,
625,0.97,5759.186,5766.594,This bill would be authorized under a section of the Gma section 3678-390.,107,,
626,0.97,5766.66,5779.373,That allows local ghosts to put in place what are called interim development controls . a local government can't put in place an interim development control that lasts longer than a year.,107,,
627,0.97,5779.44,5785.312,"Hence the kind of the structure of the bill, which has a work program for Sdci.",107,,
628,0.97,5785.379,5802.83,"That allows the count that would give SDI the opportunity to come up with something that may be more permanent, or could just be a refresh of our current regulations to make modest changes that the Council could consider in November or so.",107,,
629,0.97,5802.897,5806.734,"But under this particular Pathway, the Council can't authorize something that is longer than a year.",107,,
630,0.97,5806.8,5811.872,"In the future, the Council could consider an extension of it.",107,,
631,0.97,5811.939,5824.118,But the intent of the bill is that Stci provide a proposal for the Council to consider before the regulations expire.,107,,
632,0.97,5824.185,5828.189,So just I was just looking at the fiscal note.,108,,
633,0.97,5828.255,5836.297,"The summary and fiscal note . I know you haven't done a memo yet, that I know you're going to get to us next week.",108,,
634,0.97,5836.363,5840.768,"I was just reading the heading, and the fiscal note.",108,,
635,0.97,5840.834,5843.837,It just says during the Covid- 19 emergency.,108,,
636,0.97,5843.904,5844.471,Yeah.,109,,
637,0.97,5844.538,5849.944,If I missed I apologize.,110,,
638,0.97,5850.01,5852.58,"My apologies, the Node is not clear.",111,,
639,0.97,5852.646,5860.988,The bill as drafted right now would expire 365 days after it becomes Affective.,111,,
640,0.97,5861.055,5873.767,"Just to speak to a few of your comments, Councilmember Juarez . I mentioned that as it is now, a person doesn't need a land use approval to operate a home based business.",111,,
641,0.97,5873.834,5883.644,They just have to comply with the development standards that are associated with the home occupation.,111,,
642,0.97,5883.711,5894.455,"There may be other Permissions that they may need from the city or other bodies that have regulatory authority over them, like King County public health or the State Department of health.",111,,
643,0.97,5894.521,5912.573,"If someone wanted to operate, sell coffee, for example out of their driveway, they would probably need an approval from Seattle King County public health for that.",111,,
644,0.97,5912.64,5914.808,"Public health regulates, not Sdci.",111,,
645,0.97,5914.875,5936.263,"You mentioned fried bread . You guys are probably aware last year there was a bill to allow Micro-Enterprise home kitchens, there was state regulatory work that prohibits people from operating out of their homes.",111,,
646,0.97,5936.33,5950.344,It looked like a economy would establish a pilot program . something like that would need to pass for those types of uses to be authorized as a home occupation in the city of Seattle.,111,,
647,0.97,5950.411,5954.214,So there is a state framework above the city's land use code.,111,,
648,0.97,5954.281,5960.754,"I can cook other Besides fried bread, I just threw that out there.",112,,
649,0.97,5960.821,5970.13,"I don't want the front page Banner to say Councilmember Juarez is going to sell fried bread, so let's get that cleared up.",112,,
650,0.97,5970.197,5970.798,Thank you.,112,,
651,0.97,5970.864,5975.235,"To that Juarez, using yonder as an example.",113,,
652,0.97,5975.302,5978.339,"They opened as a tasting room, and not as a bar.",113,,
653,0.97,5978.405,5980.374,That is an important distinction there.,113,,
654,0.97,5980.441,5997.424,"Then from there with the Covid pandemic, it is unsafe for them to have people inside of their garage, because their garage was built for a model T. if they had a two car garage, they would be in a different situation.",113,,
655,0.97,5997.491,6008.635,So just understanding that those are the small nuances that we're intending to create the flexibility for.,113,,
656,0.97,6008.702,6011.839,"And all of your points, I think are really valid.",113,,
657,0.97,6011.905,6015.909,This is the second time I'll say it today.,113,,
658,0.97,6015.976,6019.58,"You teach me well, Councilmember Juarez, and you make us all better people.",113,,
659,0.97,6019.646,6029.256,"Well you to me, Mr. Strauss, but I'll let that go.",114,,
660,0.97,6029.323,6030.591,That's fair.,115,,
661,0.97,6030.657,6030.958,That's fair.,115,,
662,0.97,6031.024,6031.258,Colleagues.,115,,
663,0.97,6031.325,6031.725,Any other colleagues?,115,,
664,0.97,6031.792,6033.46,"Councilmember Pedersen, do you have questions?",115,,
665,0.97,6033.527,6036.096,"Yeah, take it away.",115,,
666,0.97,6036.163,6042.436,"Thank you, chair thank you Councilmember Juarez for those questions.",116,,
667,0.97,6042.503,6047.941,I want to thank Councilmember Strauss for bringing this forward.,116,,
668,0.97,6048.008,6063.09,"Designed to support small businesses, which I think there's a lot of common ground here on the Council for wanting and I'm supportive of measures to ensure the economic health of small businesses especially our neighborhood business districts.",116,,
669,0.97,6063.157,6071.598,I did a quick read of the Council bill 120001.,116,,
670,0.97,6071.665,6091.618,"And as I understand it, did does not change the codes inside of existing businesses, but rather it loses the regulations in residential zones where most retail businesses are prohibited in some way, so this is liberalizing those for that 12 month period.",116,,
671,0.97,6091.685,6122.049,"My questions concern the potential Unmitigated impacts on the residential areas . people living in them now might want to know more about small businesses, and the conditions popping up like traffic, maybe unintended consequences for the small businesses in the Bris districts that Councilmember Juarez mentioned, I see a lot of mentioning of the clustering of those businesses together in those districts.",116,,
672,0.97,6122.115,6127.154,"They generate foot traffic together, they get customers Tolt.",116,,
673,0.97,6127.221,6130.858,They're struggling to reopen their store fronts.,116,,
674,0.97,6130.924,6141.268,I've got a lot in my direct . Just asking for a little grace here as I try to work through my questions.,116,,
675,0.97,6141.335,6145.038,"This is, I read the bill . It's well intentioned.",116,,
676,0.97,6145.105,6148.475,I see it as being very innovative.,116,,
677,0.97,6148.542,6162.389,"It was introduced on Monday . and it was Online Friday afternoon, but I was not able to take a look at it over the weekend, and so I need more time to check in with constituents in my district about this.",116,,
678,0.97,6162.456,6186.213,"And I'm glad that we were required to have this other meeting two weeks from now, so this is really helpful, and it sounds like our central staff Freeman will be doing a memo . So please view these questions as just sort of getting them out there, just so Keol will help address some of them in the memo, and they don't have to be answered now.",116,,
679,0.97,6186.28,6187.414,Does that sound okay?,116,,
680,0.97,6187.481,6191.084,Should I just sort of rattle off some questions?,116,,
681,0.97,6191.151,6192.986,"Please, take it away.",117,,
682,0.97,6193.053,6202.195,"And I don't think we're required to have another meet willing two weeks from now, but it's a best practice, and something I strive to do.",117,,
683,0.97,6202.262,6215.876,"I don't know if it required for Gma or something . and as we emerge from the pandemic, I want to normalize, it's healthy to ask these questions.",118,,
684,0.97,6215.943,6218.111,I think people expect us to ask questions.,118,,
685,0.97,6218.178,6222.616,It's not meant to be negative about any sort of concept or a piece of legislation.,118,,
686,0.97,6222.683,6231.992,"So please view this as just sort of, people getting the public getting to see us work in Realtime asking these questions, because we're curious.",118,,
687,0.97,6232.059,6234.828,We want to make the legislation better.,118,,
688,0.97,6234.895,6243.403,We want to prevent unintended consequences.,118,,
689,0.97,6243.47,6244.371,So here we go.,118,,
690,0.97,6244.438,6248.575,So Councilmember Juarez asked the question about the Covid emergency.,118,,
691,0.97,6248.642,6254.348,It's clarified to be really Only12 months is what the governing progressions are on this bill.,118,,
692,0.97,6254.414,6276.403,"That was my first question about the 12 month period . I notice though, there is language in section 4 that says the Council APPROVES the following work plan for the development of permanent regulations.",118,,
693,0.97,6276.47,6300.927,"So I'm just trying to understand, the work plan goes through January of 2022, the 12 month plan would presumably be through March or April of 2022. is the intent here to make this a permanent thing, or is it truly just meant to expire in April of next year.",118,,
694,0.97,6300.994,6303.797,"To that and, it's a both.",119,,
695,0.97,6303.864,6334.928,"I think it's important that we make these changes during the Covid emergency, while people are spending more time in the residential neighborhoods than compared to downtown where they typically work, and if we see benefits it's important to plan out what that would be, so that every Stakeholder knows from the outset when, how, and where they can participate in a process for creating permanent regulations.",119,,
696,0.97,6334.995,6346.54,"To understand what works well, and what doesn't work well . I'm coming in Agnostic as far as what needs to happen for permanent regulations.",119,,
697,0.97,6346.606,6352.179,I think that this one year period will give us the opportunity to see what works and what doesn't work.,119,,
698,0.97,6352.245,6352.979,"Okay, thank you.",120,,
699,0.97,6353.046,6364.491,"I know it's okay if we don't answer all these questions now . However at the discretion of the chair, I'll just Ratting them off here.",120,,
700,0.97,6364.558,6375.669,"That, the making them permanent, that's where I'm sort of struggling, as we try to reopen the store fronts and the neighborhood business districts I want to give them all the help they need.",120,,
701,0.97,6375.736,6380.974,I'm just worried if this would conflict with that.,120,,
702,0.97,6381.041,6396.156,"So when I look at the work plan that the Seattle Department of inspection could be doing, Sdci, I'm wondering how they're going to measure success or failure?",120,,
703,0.97,6396.223,6400.961,"How are we going to look back and see what worked, and didn't work?",120,,
704,0.97,6401.027,6402.162,Is it just feedback we're getting?,120,,
705,0.97,6402.229,6415.742,"Is there some way to put some Metrics into what their work plan is, is one thought, so they have direction on that . Sdci is, you know, I know we're trying to get them to do things faster.",120,,
706,0.97,6415.809,6419.646,We're trying to get them to grant permitting for affordable housing faster.,120,,
707,0.97,6419.713,6430.49,We're trying to get them to get the tree protection O Ordinancedone.,120,,
708,0.97,6430.557,6435.796,I don't know if this would create more work for them to get this done.,120,,
709,0.97,6435.862,6438.498,Briefly on that Councilmember Pedersen.,121,,
710,0.97,6438.565,6449.376,We'll be hearing in the next committee briefing in the March 10th committee about the permitting backlog.,121,,
711,0.97,6449.442,6469.095,"It's been conveyed to me from the Executive's office, that we should be seeing the tree ordinance in quarter three this year, so this work plan would allow for that Cascading impact, so they could be working on this work plan during our budget crisis.",121,,
712,0.97,6469.162,6474.467,During the Council's budget process.,121,,
713,0.97,6474.534,6476.703,"So everything is, great questions, yes.",121,,
714,0.97,6476.77,6479.906,"Thank you, really sensitive to that issue with the Department.",122,,
715,0.97,6479.973,6487.013,"So one of the things, some of this legislation requires us to do as a Council is to make So- called findings.",122,,
716,0.97,6487.08,6502.662,"There was one finding that made it a little bit nervous, where it says, basically, if we don't interact this, this would Stymie the city's recover Fromy the Covid-19 Emergenc.",122,,
717,0.97,6502.729,6505.565,I don't know if it definitely would.,122,,
718,0.97,6505.632,6514.541,I feel a little uncomfortable . I just want to be sensitive to the findings we're signing our name to.,122,,
719,0.97,6514.608,6546.373,"Then I'll wait to get feedback from my own district on this . I know they're really compelling examples in Northwest Seattle about this . part of this is Cautioning, like based on powerful antic anecdotes that we received, are there policy changes, versus Blanketing changes.",122,,
720,0.97,6546.439,6552.479,I'm glad we can explore this . regarding the sign.,122,,
721,0.97,6552.545,6557.45,I just want to clarify the sign.,122,,
722,0.97,6557.517,6564.391,"Is this in addition to the existing sign, or just making the sign bigger that they can already do?",122,,
723,0.97,6564.457,6567.761,As it can have multiple signs.,123,,
724,0.97,6567.827,6571.298,They just can't be greater than 64 inches.,123,,
725,0.97,6571.364,6574.267,That would replace that requirement.,123,,
726,0.97,6574.334,6582.275,So at the can have one Non- illuminated larger sign.,123,,
727,0.97,6582.342,6591.918,If there's some sort explanation for the rational basis for the change in the sign size.,124,,
728,0.97,6591.985,6598.825,What are we getting that number from the 720?,124,,
729,0.97,6598.892,6599.526,"Sure, go ahead.",125,,
730,0.97,6599.592,6600.46,Go ahead.,126,,
731,0.97,6600.527,6616.943,"This is one I think it's just a matter of judgment here by Council about what is large enough, and what is too large.",127,,
732,0.97,6617.01,6633.893,"A problem that yonder cider had, had to do with sign stuff . This is something where a larger sign might be appropriate for a home occupation on an interim basis . But how big that is, that's a matter of judgment for the Council.",127,,
733,0.97,6633.96,6643.269,"And so that point exactly is not that we are just trying to open the door here, right?",128,,
734,0.97,6643.336,6656.082,"There are loopholes in our current code, where you could have multiple signs of the smaller dimensions, we're just trying to create that level playing field of you get one sign, and this is as big as it can go.",128,,
735,0.97,6656.149,6660.653,Just the last of touches on that.,129,,
736,0.97,6660.72,6667.994,Would it make sense to define what type of small businesses could operate under this interim legislation?,129,,
737,0.97,6668.061,6683.243,"The way I'm reading it, it's just saying small business . It's not specifying retail, or something to provide some Guardrails, and an explanation to the public of what might pop up in their neighborhood, which they can be excited about, or surprised about.",129,,
738,0.97,6683.309,6688.181,"Just having some Guardrails on that, maybe defining it in some way.",129,,
739,0.97,6688.248,6696.089,Those are all my comments and questions.,129,,
740,0.97,6696.156,6704.531,"I appreciate the grace to ask them all here, because we'll look forward to Ketle's memo.",129,,
741,0.97,6704.597,6708.768,Do you have last question?,130,,
742,0.97,6708.835,6728.655,"I don't believe that the land use code is where we determine what businesses are able to operate in a certain place . I think you said earlier, that currently, any business can operate out of a home as it stands, it's just that they --",130,,
743,0.97,6728.721,6732.759,They have it to meet operating requirements.,131,,
744,0.97,6732.826,6739.666,"So some of operating requirements include limitations on noise, odor, things like that.",131,,
745,0.97,6739.732,6755.048,That automatically Precludes certain businesses that might have those negative intern Internalities.,131,,
746,0.97,6755.115,6759.786,"A coffee roaster, that's probably not going to qualify as a home application.",131,,
747,0.97,6759.853,6794.921,"But generally, as long as you meet the development standards of the zone, and you meet the requirements for a home occupation then you can operate, and there's not a limitation on the type of business activity associated with the home occupation . Seattle is, I've not done an extensive amount of research on Ãšthis, but Seattle is more than Portlands which requires a land use permit for more intensive home occupations.",131,,
748,0.97,6794.988,6813.773,"So that's not the current structure of our code now . that's something that could result from work that Sdci and the Council does in figuring out whether or how to change, how we regulate home occupations.",131,,
749,0.97,6813.84,6825.451,Councilmember did ask about the work plan . that work plan includes how this might tend with Sdci capacity.,132,,
750,0.97,6825.518,6842.435,"There's a mechanical component to this work plan as well under that authorizing authority in the growth management act, 3670- 390, there are two time periods for which a council could, a local government could implement regulations.",132,,
751,0.97,6842.502,6846.039,"One is a year, and the other Issix months.",132,,
752,0.97,6846.105,6858.218,"If a local jurisdiction wants to have regular interim regulations in place for more than 6 months, so for up to a year, there must be a work plan.",132,,
753,0.97,6858.284,6864.057,This piece of legislation reflects the requirements of 3678-390.,132,,
754,0.97,6864.123,6878.037,"If the counsel, for whatever reason wanted to just have a 6 month set of interim regulations, the work plan would not need to be part of the legislation.",132,,
755,0.97,6878.104,6878.538,Councilmember Pedersen.,132,,
756,0.97,6878.605,6896.689,"Just following up you just said, but does Rcw3678- 390, say it has to be a part of current regulations?",133,,
757,0.97,6896.756,6906.866,"This tool is to, it's a tool that is intended to address kind of unforeseen circumstances and land use planning.",134,,
758,0.97,6906.933,6928.388,"So for example, if a city adopted a set of regulations or if a novel land use came along that was not addressed by current regulations, this is a tool that is available to local governments to put interim regulations in place while it's considering whether or not to make permanent changes.",134,,
759,0.97,6928.454,6949.175,"A couple of examples of how the Council has used this tool in the past, for the Aurora Lipton urban village, a lot of, an unintended thing that was happening there was a lot of storage facilities were being developed in the neighborhood commercial zone where folks wanted a more active streetlight.",134,,
760,0.97,6949.242,6953.379,So the Council put a place on a moratorium on the development of storage units.,134,,
761,0.97,6953.446,6955.348,You're going to up.,135,,
762,0.97,6955.415,6960.153,You're going to drag me into this.,135,,
763,0.97,6960.219,6960.953,Okay.,135,,
764,0.97,6961.02,6961.954,That's one example.,136,,
765,0.97,6962.021,6962.789,How convenient!,137,,
766,0.97,6962.855,6971.898,That moratorium when Mha was adopted.,138,,
767,0.97,6971.964,6981.741,Another example of thousand the Council used this tool in the past has been for mobile home parks.,138,,
768,0.97,6981.808,6989.248,The Council has some regulations that apply to the two remaining mobile home park developments in the city of Seattle.,138,,
769,0.97,6989.315,7003.329,Hopefully this in the next few months here will be looking at more permanent regulations to address the circumstances associated with those parks . It's a tool for emergency situations or unintended consequences.,138,,
770,0.97,7003.396,7016.376,"Here, it's sort of the emergent situation is the Covid civil emergency and the difficulties it may put small businesses under.",138,,
771,0.97,7016.442,7031.724,"Well now that blast, can I just say this? first of all, chairman Strauss, thank you so much for giving us so much latitude to ask these questions.",139,,
772,0.97,7031.791,7040.566,I sometimes think committees devolve into just performance art.,139,,
773,0.97,7040.633,7048.141,We're just trying to figure this out so we can respond to all of our critics and constituents.,139,,
774,0.97,7048.207,7053.312,"When we put those moratoriums in, let me at the you, it was no easy feat.",139,,
775,0.97,7053.379,7060.653,There was a ton of blow back . We did all the work on the corridor with the groups and the businesses.,139,,
776,0.97,7060.72,7063.723,"And we were very clear, that it was interim.",139,,
777,0.97,7063.79,7071.664,We also looked at the impact to existing businesses there . So I just want to put that out there.,139,,
778,0.97,7071.731,7079.038,Same thing with the zoning issues we're dealing with manufactured homes.,139,,
779,0.97,7079.105,7087.113,"We're not looking at spot zoning, but how we're going to work with this for the public good.",139,,
780,0.97,7087.18,7092.485,"That being said, Mr. chair, may I make a few more comments?",139,,
781,0.97,7092.552,7093.286,Go for it.,140,,
782,0.97,7093.352,7094.253,"Okay, great.",141,,
783,0.97,7094.32,7096.622,"So we all know, and I've been saying this.",141,,
784,0.97,7096.689,7102.762,"I have two words, and you heard me say this before, it's not happy birthday.",141,,
785,0.97,7102.829,7116.742,"But the two worlds that I've been saying over and over is the vaccine and recovery . We know that that's our motto and our Claire Clarion call for big business, downtown, Nhl, waterfront.",141,,
786,0.97,7116.809,7140.867,"So when we look at small businesses, I understand what we're trying to do here, and that makes complete sense . I had an opportunity to attend the downtown Seattle Association, I think some of you all did too last week . This morning, I had the opportunity to address the Mercer corridor Stakeholder Committee, in which there's over 110 businesses all in South Lake Union, that whole quarter.",141,,
787,0.97,7140.933,7146.639,"That whole Commercer corridor, which also including the Ballard District Council uptown.",141,,
788,0.97,7146.706,7154.78,"Just Dsa, all of those groups . believe it or not, the bigger issues that you talk about business also affect the smaller businesses.",141,,
789,0.97,7154.847,7162.755,"In the sense that we want to get our economy moving again, we want to encourage Entrepreneurship.",141,,
790,0.97,7162.822,7171.297,"We want to encourage streamline, permitting in certain businesses, because we're in the middle of this pandemic fueled recession, so we want to do everything we can to help businesses.",141,,
791,0.97,7171.364,7190.082,"I just don't want to overlook, that we're not setting up an uneven playing field, with the already existing businesses three or four blocks away from where we have single family zoning residents to do things that they normally couldn't do . so that is where my questioning is coming in.",141,,
792,0.97,7190.149,7205.231,"So I really look forward to working with you Councilmember Strauss, and the memo, and the work plan, so we can work together how this would also impact existing small businesses.",141,,
793,0.97,7205.298,7225.284,"And maybe you can follow up with us, if you can give me the bill number again, how can he with do a compare and contrast, what's going to happen on the Stateside, the state bill that you Referenced?",141,,
794,0.97,7225.351,7226.285,It's house bill,142,,
795,0.97,7226.352,7235.394,That's all I I will look forward to opening my fried bread business.,143,,
796,0.97,7235.461,7240.9,You're spot on to take away from current businesses.,144,,
797,0.97,7240.967,7245.905,"To make sure that when we reopen, we're able to do so in a really forecast and quick manner.",144,,
798,0.97,7245.972,7262.154,So I just take us back to slide 3 here on today's presentation . and to Councilmember Pedersen's question earlier.,144,,
799,0.97,7262.221,7267.193,Home business occupations already exist.,144,,
800,0.97,7267.259,7270.73,"There are other elements that license and ensure safety, et cetera.",144,,
801,0.97,7270.796,7313.005,"This bill would just change the number of employees in the space, the type of customer visits, and the increased traffic, and parking demands . again, it would change their sign code regulations, and requirement for space required for park so this is pretty narrowly tailored, Councilmember Juarez, you've reported on the number of businesses that have closed downtown during this pandemic . so many success.",144,,
802,0.97,7313.072,7330.389,"Businesses started out of garages, and while we, when we open back up, and everyone's downtown again, we want to make sure that we have businesses that are ready to scale up, and fill in those vacant spaces that we're currently seeing today.",144,,
803,0.97,7330.456,7330.856,So that's the intent.,144,,
804,0.97,7330.923,7347.073,I absolutely welcome all of your questions because it's clarifying for the public and it will make this bill stronger.,144,,
805,0.97,7347.139,7348.14,"Councilmember Pedersen, please.",144,,
806,0.97,7348.207,7361.12,"I just want to getting hungry and thirsty, listening to all of this about fried bread, and cider, and Pizza.",145,,
807,0.97,7361.187,7362.354,Just last question.,145,,
808,0.97,7362.421,7375.801,"I mentioned the employees . I don't know if there's been any consideration to again, putting some Guardrails on that, because it sounds like it's been lifted to potentially unlimited staff that can come in and out of the home.",145,,
809,0.97,7375.868,7383.642,Just something to consider if there were any amendments to consider there could be a finite number of that.,145,,
810,0.97,7383.709,7385.277,Thank you.,145,,
811,0.97,7385.344,7386.479,And thank you Pedersen.,146,,
812,0.97,7386.545,7393.819,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but this would lift the land use code requirements.",146,,
813,0.97,7393.886,7404.63,"They would still be subjected to other codes, especially during this time of public health requirements of how many people can be in a certain space together.",146,,
814,0.97,7404.697,7408.501,So it wouldn't eliminate any regulation all together.,146,,
815,0.97,7408.567,7414.44,"Just, it would eliminate it, or it would temporarily remove it from the land use code.",146,,
816,0.97,7414.507,7425.985,"So the current are that no more than two people, no more than two Nonresidents can work in a home occupation.",147,,
817,0.97,7426.051,7432.725,There probably are operating limitations that go along with just the general guidance from King County public health about Covid.,147,,
818,0.97,7432.792,7442.168,"The number of employees may be contingent if someone were applying with that, maybe contingent on just the characteristics of a particular site.",147,,
819,0.97,7442.234,7464.957,"If it's a large site, if it's a two or three car garage, as opposed to a one car garage, there could be more employees . But there is not a cap, there is not a land use cap for the bill as introduced on the number of employees that could work out of a Home-Based business.",147,,
820,0.97,7465.024,7476.168,"Well it seems as exhausted the questions, and colleagues please, feel free to ask me questions.",148,,
821,0.97,7476.235,7477.636,Ask questions in the next two weeks.,148,,
822,0.97,7477.703,7483.075,This is meant to be a conversation.,148,,
823,0.97,7483.142,7486.812,"I love being able to disagree, and not be disagreeable.",148,,
824,0.97,7486.879,7503.429,"I think when we disagree, we're able to find, we're strengthening ourselves, and are strengthening what we pass . So I really appreciate everyone's questions today, and comments.",148,,
825,0.97,7503.495,7509.301,Anything further there?,148,,
826,0.97,7509.368,7510.035,Not seeing anything.,148,,
827,0.97,7510.102,7510.436,Thank you Kitil.,148,,
828,0.97,7510.502,7514.506,I'm just wondering done with this love Fest because I've got to go.,149,,
829,0.97,7514.573,7517.076,I was just going to you.,150,,
830,0.97,7517.142,7520.613,"Actually, my script says thank you, Ketil.",150,,
831,0.97,7520.679,7540.232,"I'm looking forward to this legislation coming for further discussion in a committee vote . If there's no good of the order, Councilmember Mosqueda had signed on as could sponsor on this bill.",150,,
832,0.97,7540.299,7547.706,I will not be offering it for Cosponsorrership.,150,,
833,0.97,7547.773,7557.85,"Seeing nothing, this concluding the February 24th meeting of the land use committee.",150,,
834,0.97,7557.917,7558.384,Thank you for attending.,150,,
835,0.97,7558.45,7561.72,We are adjourned.,150,,
