39,0.97,121.888,127.36,Good afternoon Councilmembers and chair Mosqueda.,18,,
40,0.97,127.36,128.328,This is arts 1A1.,18,,
41,0.97,128.328,129.963,Before I start this section.,18,,
42,0.97,129.963,135.935,I would NOTE there is a Walk-On amendment that we'll discuss at the end of the section.,18,,
43,0.97,135.935,140.373,After we discuss arts for A1.,18,,
44,0.97,140.373,143.443,We're discussing arts 1A1.,18,,
45,0.97,143.443,151.484,"$250,000 of General fund to the office of arts and culture to support a public light art Festival in South Lake Union.",18,,
46,0.97,151.484,156.055,"Sponsored by Councilmember Lewis, cosponsored by Morales and Strauss.",18,,
47,0.97,156.055,158.858,I'll turn it over to Councilmember Lewis.,18,,
48,0.97,158.858,162.996,Thank you Asha.,19,,
49,0.97,162.996,168.168,So the Borealis Festival of light festival last occurred in South Lake Union in 2018.,19,,
50,0.97,168.168,172.038,This is been tentatively planned to occur again on two occasions.,19,,
51,0.97,172.038,175.808,Both of which were delayed due to Covid considerations.,19,,
52,0.97,175.808,187.287,"For those who are unfamiliar, it's a type of artistic light show that's projected on the side of the Moji building.",19,,
53,0.97,187.287,193.426,Done in collaboration with Moji museum of industry and history.,19,,
54,0.97,193.426,198.765,As well as South Union Stakeholders and community members.,19,,
55,0.97,198.765,207.04,"So this arts Festival in 2018 was a really big, unexpected hit in terms of its magnitude, of course.",19,,
56,0.97,207.04,213.546,It was anticipated that there would be large community interest as there have been for similar light festivals around the world.,19,,
57,0.97,213.546,228.728,But it really brought a lot of people into the South Lake Union neighborhood and really helped to build a--an artistic identity for the neighborhood that's more associated with being a work space for the Tech economy.,19,,
58,0.97,228.728,232.265,And was really a fruitful collaboration with Moji.,19,,
59,0.97,232.265,243.977,They're seeking supporting money here from us as well as from King county in order to make sure this festival can come back in a really big way in 2022 at this point.,19,,
60,0.97,243.977,266.933,And this is a good opportunity for us to provide some support to this effort which does have a fair amount of nonprofit and private support as well to leverage it and make sure that this can occur again as a free and open to the public Festival in the South Lake Union neighborhood in 2022.,19,,
61,0.97,266.933,272.905,"Thank you very much, are there any additional comments or questions on this?",20,,
62,0.97,272.905,279.045,"Okay, thanks so much.",21,,
63,0.97,279.045,285.151,Let's move on to number two from arts.,21,,
64,0.97,285.151,296.262,This is Council budget action arts 2A 1. it would add three temporary positions to the office of arts and culture to support public arts and cultural or creative industry programming.,21,,
65,0.97,296.262,303.636,It is sponsored by Councilmember Morales and cosponsored by Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Lewis.,21,,
66,0.97,303.636,308.408,On behalf of Councilmember Morales I want to add additional context.,22,,
67,0.97,308.408,314.347,The CBA would allow for programming production and cultural events in neighborhoods across the city.,22,,
68,0.97,314.347,318.518,Similar to the welcome back weeks we had in downtown Seattle.,22,,
69,0.97,318.518,322.121,I want to thank the Councilmembers who cosponsored.,22,,
70,0.97,322.121,323.089,Lewis and Sawant.,22,,
71,0.97,323.089,331.097,And the goal of this CBA is to employee as many artists and creative industry workers as possible.,22,,
72,0.97,331.097,343.843,Centered around Bipoc workers and to draw in more people as patrons for local businesses particularly in areas outside of the downtown core that have more Bipoc residents and Bipoc owned businesses that continue to struggle during the pandemic.,22,,
73,0.97,343.843,345.244,"Councilmember Lewis, please go ahead.",22,,
74,0.97,346.312,355.688,"Thank you, Madame chair, I really appreciate being able to come in here and support Morales in this initiative.",23,,
75,0.97,355.688,384.65,"We saw over last summer, the incredible impact of our welcome back week events that brought thousands of people into the city core to engage in community Collaborations, to see live concerts, to just generally, you know, hang out and really bring some energy back to parts of the city that really had not seen very many people for a period of several months.",23,,
76,0.97,384.65,413.479,And Thible to really lean into that and sort of treat that experience almost as a pilot and be able to carve out a significant amount of money to continue those kinds of Activations and spread them to additional neighborhoods around the city is really appealing and will be like a corner stone of our recovery in terms of getting people to come out and do these community activities again after us all being PENT up in our homes for such a long time.,23,,
77,0.97,413.479,426.726,So Nything that we're putting towards that is not just for Reinvigorating the cultural identity of the city but really also to reinvigorate our commercial districts and small business districts as well.,23,,
78,0.97,426.726,428.594,And I'm really excited to be supporting this.,23,,
79,0.97,428.594,430.263,Thank you so much.,24,,
80,0.97,430.263,431.964,"I appreciate it, Council President Gonzales.",24,,
81,0.97,431.964,435.101,"Thank you so much, chair Mosqueda.",25,,
82,0.97,435.101,439.705,I just want to indicate my interest in being added as a cosponsor.,25,,
83,0.97,439.705,446.078,"Thank you very much, Council President Gonzales, Council President Gonzales is adding her name to arts 002.",26,,
84,0.97,446.078,447.313,Thank you very much.,26,,
85,0.97,449.348,452.285,Additional comments? okay.,26,,
86,0.97,452.285,455.988,Let's move on to 003.,26,,
87,0.97,455.988,467.533,3A 1 would add $2 million to the office of arts and culture for organizations that did not qualify for Venue operators grant funding this past year.,27,,
88,0.97,467.533,474.14,It's sponsored by Councilmember Strauss and cosponsored by Councilmembers Morales and Lewis.,27,,
89,0.97,474.14,478.878,"Wonderful, thank you Councilmember Strauss, please go ahead.",28,,
90,0.97,478.878,488.621,This amendment adds 2 million to the office of arts and culture to provide financial assistance to those not eligible for Federal aid during the Coronavirus pandemic it's a still occurring.,28,,
91,0.97,488.621,498.264,Small business administrations shuttered Venue operators grants was primary emergency Federal assistance for museums during Covid-19.,28,,
92,0.97,498.264,506.806,Many museums did not meet the requirements for shuttered in operators grant.,28,,
93,0.97,506.806,513.446,Including requirements that museums include fixed seating such as theaters do to receive this funding.,28,,
94,0.97,513.446,519.785,"An example in my district is the National Nordic museum, and national museum.",28,,
95,0.97,519.785,531.464,Expected to receive about a million dollars in funding before realizing that they're not E Legible because the Museum has a ballroom with adjustable seating rather than a fixed theater.,28,,
96,0.97,531.464,534.3,For many of you that have been there there are chairs in the room.,28,,
97,0.97,534.3,539.272,They are just not attached to the ground and that criteria makes them ineligible.,28,,
98,0.97,539.272,540.406,Upon realizing this.,28,,
99,0.97,540.406,552.251,I also did an additional investigation to understand that Northwestern African American Museum both did not receive funding.,28,,
100,0.97,552.251,557.29,And I can share a full list of recipients with any Councilmembers who are curious.,28,,
101,0.97,557.29,560.226,If their district was left out.,28,,
102,0.97,560.226,570.036,This $2 million would allow us as an entire city to support our museums that were left out of Federal aid due to these arbitrary eligibility requirements.,28,,
103,0.97,570.036,572.905,Not here advocating for one Museum over the other.,28,,
104,0.97,572.905,577.61,Just noting that these are the examples of this eligibility requirement.,28,,
105,0.97,577.61,578.044,"Thank you, chair.",28,,
106,0.97,578.044,578.978,Thank you very much.,29,,
107,0.97,578.978,580.913,I appreciate you explaining that.,29,,
108,0.97,580.913,590.79,I think grasping the concept of having our museums not be included because they don't have fixed seating was something that I learned about too when I visited the Nordic museum.,29,,
109,0.97,590.79,596.596,So I appreciate you explaining to the viewing audience as well what that difference is.,29,,
110,0.97,596.596,598.064,"Council President, please go ahead.",29,,
111,0.97,598.064,604.27,I also wanted to signal my interest in being added as a cosponsor.,30,,
112,0.97,604.27,609.175,"I do see this as complimentary, certainly, to the Seattle rescue plan.",30,,
113,0.97,609.175,619.585,And our recognition in those efforts to allocate specific funding for our local arts organizations that were unable to for example access some of these Federal dollars.,30,,
114,0.97,619.585,632.765,And so I do think this is a very complimentary funding proposal to what we have done and Prioritized as a city council in the past and appreciate Councilmember Strauss bringing this forward.,30,,
115,0.97,632.765,635.768,"Thank you, Council President Gonzales.",31,,
116,0.97,635.768,638.237,Council President Gonzales adding her name to arts 003.,31,,
117,0.97,638.237,639.472,Thank you very much.,31,,

125,0.97,671.27,676.308,There's an Underpass that had a mural put on it to stop Gras fit if I from happening.,34,,
126,0.97,676.308,681.514,It's--it was a beautiful community led mural.,34,,
127,0.97,681.514,683.049,Painted originally in 1997.,34,,
128,0.97,683.049,685.117,It has been updated.,34,,
129,0.97,685.117,688.821,Community members have come around to coalesce around this.,34,,
130,0.97,688.821,693.159,And the public art has been very badly Defaced over the past year.,34,,
131,0.97,693.159,700.433,Which has been really painful for a number of community members who made it a reality.,34,,
132,0.97,700.433,706.272,This is a humble request in funding for arts and culture to restore and likely Repain the mural.,34,,
133,0.97,706.272,706.572,Thank you.,34,,
134,0.97,706.572,711.31,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Strauss, any additional comments or questions?",35,,

136,0.97,714.013,717.95,I did have the chance to visit with folks at urban art works recently.,35,,
137,0.97,717.95,741.707,"For folks who have had the chance to see the youth focused art programs that are run out of that facility, they really emphasize how graffiti and art that we see throughout the streets in Seattle could be channeled in healthy and productive ways to support young budding artists if we had something like a free wall.",35,,
138,0.97,741.707,758.791,"I would love to talk more with you about how we maybe compliment restoration of the art you're talking about in this location with maybe a free wall so that those who are interested in practicing art with using spray paint, that they have a safe place, a legal place to go to use that.",35,,
139,0.97,758.791,770.436,And that we continue to try to foster support for youth to have creative outlets that are safe and legal and you never know.,35,,
140,0.97,770.436,774.039,We're going to get the next Banksy or Kaplan.,35,,
141,0.97,774.039,778.144,My friend name is Kaplan from Hawaii who is a wonderful artist now as well.,35,,
142,0.97,778.144,786.152,You never know who we will get out of these efforts?,35,,
143,0.97,786.152,789.288,We will continue to look into a free wall concept to pair with this.,36,,
144,0.97,789.288,789.889,Thank you.,37,,
145,0.97,789.889,790.523,Thank you.,38,,
146,0.97,790.523,793.359,All right let's move on to the Walk-On amendment.,39,,

151,0.97,808.507,815.281,On behalf of Councilmember Morales I'm offering these comments.,41,,
152,0.97,815.281,818.951,Last year we created the public space agency development authority.,41,,
153,0.97,818.951,830.563,This is a real game change tore have a mission driven organization that can successfully navigate the world of commercial Realestate on--and--excuse me.,41,,
154,0.97,830.563,835.868,Commercial Realestate on behalf of our cultural art sector.,41,,
155,0.97,835.868,844.343,"We know cultural art spaces are the heart of neighborhoods, and this public development authority can preserve spaces and keep production performance in the city.",41,,
156,0.97,844.343,847.98,We created the agency but we have not yet Resourced it.,41,,
157,0.97,847.98,850.95,It's not entirely dependent on city funds.,41,,
158,0.97,850.95,853.185,They've raised 2 million so far through a private investor.,41,,
159,0.97,853.185,867.299,And we'll continue to build public private partnerships with a recent round of strategic investment funds of words over 20 organizations who applied for the cultural space agency as potential partners for the project.,41,,
160,0.97,867.299,870.202,"Of those 20, only four organizations were awarded the grant.",41,,
161,0.97,870.202,876.742,With the PDA as a partner totaling 11.5 million in funds to those organizations.,41,,
162,0.97,876.742,877.409,Not PDA itself.,41,,
163,0.97,877.409,884.984,This amendment would provide a 5 Million-Dollar investment for seed funding to the PDA to build art space equitably.,41,,
164,0.97,884.984,890.689,It would allow the PDA to hold and preserve affordable cultural space.,41,,
165,0.97,890.689,897.263,"Ensuring investments are made under Sif but also further the development process, including construction and opening up of some of the projects.",41,,
166,0.97,898.597,902.301,Any additional comments or questions?,41,,

181,0.97,960.292,965.631,"The prime sponsor, Council President Gonzales with Councilmembers Mosqueda and Morales as cosponsors.",44,,
182,0.97,965.631,968.934,And I'll turn it over to Council President Gonzales.,44,,
183,0.97,968.934,973.038,"Thank you, Amy.",45,,
184,0.97,973.038,984.35,"Just really quickly, this addition is one of my top priorities in this budget process.",46,,
185,0.97,984.35,994.693,It would be responsive to requests that we've received from legal service providers who are currently working with our legal defense Fund.,46,,
186,0.97,994.693,998.597,Including the Northwest immigrant rights project and kids in need of defense.,46,,
187,0.97,998.597,1007.139,I'm asking that the Council support an increase for funding available to the legal defense fund for three primary reasons.,46,,
188,0.97,1007.139,1024.189,"The first is to acknowledge that there has been an increase in the cost of service delivery that, you know, we have not actually increased the base funding for the legal defense network since we first implemented it in 2016.",46,,
189,0.97,1024.189,1035.934,"And so this is an opportunity for us to acknowledge that there has been increase to cost of service delivery, and that we should scale up the investment accordingly.",46,,
190,0.97,1035.934,1047.179,"The second reason is that in order for us to meet the needs of increased unaccompanied immigrant children arriving to our region, we need to provide them with urgent immigration legal assistance.",46,,
191,0.97,1047.179,1055.254,So just about half of unaccompanied children who arrive to Washington state arrive here in the Seattle King County area.,46,,
192,0.97,1055.254,1057.556,And these kids are unaccompanied.,46,,
193,0.97,1057.556,1061.46,Meaning that they're here by themselves and most of them cannot afford attorneys.,46,,
194,0.97,1061.46,1072.237,"And we know that Unrepresented children, in other words, children who do not have legal representation in immigration court are 97 times.",46,,
195,0.97,1072.237,1079.678,That's 97 times less likely to be granted relief by an immigration judge compared to those with an attorney.,46,,
196,0.97,1079.678,1094.96,"So in order, there are 97 times more likely to be Deported from our country by virtue of not the merits of their case, but by virtue of the fact that they are Unrepresented in immigration court.",46,,
197,0.97,1094.96,1105.504,The third reason is that the Biden administration has selected Seattle as one of eleven cities to expedite asylum seeking families through immigration court.,46,,
198,0.97,1105.504,1113.745,"However, the Biden administration has not yet provided the resources to support those families.",46,,
199,0.97,1113.745,1126.792,And legal representation is one of the areas that has been identified as a major area of need for our asylum seeking families that we expect to welcome here into the city of Seattle.,46,,
200,0.97,1126.792,1130.062,So I hope others will consider supporting this request.,46,,
201,0.97,1130.062,1143.742,And I do want to extend by deepest gratitude to Councilmember Mosqueda and Morales for your Cosponsorship of this important opportunity to expand the legal defense network.,46,,
202,0.97,1143.742,1144.51,Thank you Madame chair.,46,,
203,0.97,1144.51,1148.48,"Thank you very much, Council President.",47,,
204,0.97,1148.48,1153.986,"Additional questions or comments? Council President, I appreciate that you've brought this forward.",47,,
205,0.97,1153.986,1169.902,And also the flag that you raised about the potential for Federal support at some point needing to step in here as a city to invest early and ensure there's continuity in our services and we're continuing to Prioritize the most vulnerable.,47,,
206,0.97,1169.902,1172.571,This is in alignment with those values.,47,,
207,0.97,1172.571,1173.939,Thank you for bringing that up.,47,,
208,0.97,1173.939,1175.34,Let's wrap this section.,47,,
209,0.97,1175.34,1177.91,I think that concludes that section.,47,,
210,0.97,1177.91,1178.277,Is that right?,47,,
211,0.97,1178.277,1181.547,Are we ready to move to the final sub category for the day?,47,,
212,0.97,1181.547,1184.917,"Yes, we're ready to move on to the next agenda item?",48,,
213,0.97,1184.917,1187.653,Thank you for your work on this.,49,,
214,0.97,1187.653,1189.621,"Madame chair, excuse me, that'd be me.",49,,
215,0.97,1189.621,1193.125,"Madame clerk, could you read the next item in the record.",49,,
216,0.97,1193.125,1197.563,Seattle Department of construction and inspections for briefing and discussion.,50,,
217,0.97,1197.563,1198.163,Okay colleagues.,51,,
218,0.97,1198.163,1200.432,I want to give you a quick time check.,51,,
219,0.97,1200.432,1201.667,We're still doing well on time.,51,,
220,0.97,1201.667,1208.44,I appreciate that you have limited your comments about the possible amendments that you're interested in Prioritizing for the budget.,51,,
221,0.97,1208.44,1222.821,"Thank you as well for being judicious in your Cosponsorship and if you do have questions, if you'd like to offer additional context, of course, please feel free to do that, this is the opportunity for those questions to get aired.",51,,
222,0.97,1222.821,1225.09,So we fully understand the amendments in front of us.,51,,
223,0.97,1225.09,1233.131,"If you have any additional information given your per view or participation on committees or in community, feel free to share that.",51,,
224,0.97,1233.131,1236.234,Thank you for helping to keep us on time today.,51,,
225,0.97,1236.234,1240.005,"Tomorrow and Thursday, we'll have a little bit of additional time.",51,,
226,0.97,1240.005,1243.542,But I do think this has been very helpful in terms of our discussion so far.,51,,
227,0.97,1243.542,1252.05,"In this final section here, planning community and workforce development, there's a number of items that I think have important intersections.",51,,
228,0.97,1252.05,1254.886,So I look forward to our discussion the rest of this afternoon.,51,,
229,0.97,1254.886,1256.788,And we're on track to end by 5:00 P.M.,51,,
230,0.97,1256.788,1258.69,Thank you for all your work today.,51,,
231,0.97,1258.69,1260.425,I'll hand it over to central staff.,51,,
232,0.97,1260.425,1262.327,Thank you for being here with us.,51,,
233,0.97,1262.327,1265.13,"Sure, thank you.",52,,
234,0.97,1265.13,1272.337,"Chair Mosqueda, council central staff, I'll be walking through the Mayor pro amendments.",52,,
235,0.97,1272.337,1276.275,There are eleven proposed amendments.,52,,
236,0.97,1276.275,1278.31,And three brad categories.,52,,
237,0.97,1278.31,1279.945,Permit process improvements.,52,,
238,0.97,1279.945,1280.412,Tree protection.,52,,
239,0.97,1280.412,1286.084,And amendments related to Stcs function as a regulator.,52,,
240,0.97,1286.084,1289.921,Landlords and also provider of services to tenants.,52,,
241,0.97,1289.921,1314.446,"The first proposed amendment is Isddi 1A 1. it would add $150,000 in general fund to the Seattle Department of construction and inspections to contract with a consultant to conduct a comparative study of permit review times and processes for jurisdictions regionally and nationally.",52,,
242,0.97,1314.446,1323.321,"The sponsor, Councilmember Strauss, Council President Gonzales are cosponsored.",52,,
243,0.97,1323.321,1325.524,"Councilmember Strauss, anything to add?",53,,
244,0.97,1325.524,1329.961,"Yes, thank you chair, thank you Keetle.",54,,
245,0.97,1329.961,1332.13,The next three amendments I'm speaking to.,54,,
246,0.97,1332.13,1335.1,There's another amendment before we get to the last of my three.,54,,
247,0.97,1335.1,1337.903,These are all focused around permit review times.,54,,
248,0.97,1337.903,1349.314,"Whether you or somebody you know has applied for a permit within the city of Seattle, you may know that there's a longer turn around time than is desired.",54,,
249,0.97,1349.314,1356.555,And so we're taking a Multifaceted approach to addressing permit review times.,54,,
250,0.97,1356.555,1372.571,The first and one of the more important ones is having that external consultant certified to report on such things provide us a report on outcomes from our permitting process.,54,,
251,0.97,1372.571,1380.445,Including how our permit review times compare jurisdictions for various types and sizes of projects.,54,,
252,0.97,1380.445,1398.396,"We hear from neighbors looking to Remodel that our permit process can be a burden that prevents housing units from coming Online in a timely manner or if a person is a single, one-time customer for a permit that they don't have their expectations met with the turn around time.",54,,
253,0.97,1398.396,1405.737,So this consul tan report will provide us a road map for making additional improvements to our permitting review time.,54,,
254,0.97,1405.737,1410.275,The next two I will speak about a couple more specific items about permitting.,54,,
255,0.97,1410.275,1410.942,"Thank you, chair.",54,,
256,0.97,1410.942,1418.083,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Strauss, any additional questions or comments on this item?",55,,
257,0.97,1418.083,1418.283,Okay.,55,,
258,0.97,1418.283,1423.855,"Councilmember, I am not seeing any.",55,,
259,0.97,1423.855,1426.525,"This is a sly, correct?",55,,
260,0.97,1426.525,1432.364,"This is $150,000 for the third party consultant report.",56,,
261,0.97,1432.364,1437.702,We have the sly as the third item.,56,,
262,0.97,1437.702,1439.137,Designed review report sly.,56,,
263,0.97,1440.338,1440.705,Okay.,57,,
264,0.97,1440.705,1442.774,Thank you so much for that correction.,57,,
265,0.97,1442.774,1447.112,I'll correct my notes over here.,57,,
266,0.97,1447.112,1452.284,Let's move on then to Sdci 102.,57,,
267,0.97,1452.284,1460.625,Would add position authority for permit reviewers or permit review locations outside of the Seattle Department of construction inspections.,58,,
268,0.97,1460.625,1472.771,Specifically to add possession authority to Spu Seattle city lights and the fire Marshal's office it would make a general fund appropriation to fund the position at the fire marshals office.,58,,
269,0.97,1472.771,1488.32,And it would request that the city budget office propose fee adjustments and the creation of enterprise funds to make those positions at the fire Marshal's office fully fee supported.,58,,
270,0.97,1488.32,1491.456,Sponsored by Councilmember Strauss.,58,,
271,0.97,1491.456,1496.561,And cosponsored by Councilmembers Morales and Gonzales.,58,,
272,0.97,1496.561,1498.964,Thank you very much.,59,,
273,0.97,1498.964,1499.965,"Please, Councilmember Strauss.",59,,
274,0.97,1499.965,1501.867,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",60,,
275,0.97,1501.867,1509.975,These three amendments are all part of trying to make our government work better for everyday people.,60,,
276,0.97,1509.975,1513.979,One thing I'd like to note.,60,,
277,0.97,1513.979,1517.015,I appreciate Keetle for walking back my initial request.,60,,
278,0.97,1517.015,1524.656,Which was going to be a much larger dollar figure and would have put different position authority at different review desks.,60,,
279,0.97,1524.656,1526.525,We have narrowed that request down to just this.,60,,
280,0.97,1526.525,1528.527,And as we discussed just earlier.,60,,
281,0.97,1528.527,1539.371,"We continue to hear concerns about how bottlenecks in our permitting system are causing costly delays to much needed housing, making it challenging to get permits for anything from an Adu to a Remodel.",60,,
282,0.97,1539.371,1552.717,"After having a series of meetings to discuss the issues in our permitting system with Stakeholders, the Department staff and the land use enable committee.",60,,
283,0.97,1552.717,1555.353,It's clear it's due to staffing shortages.,60,,
284,0.97,1555.353,1559.524,When we look at the permitting system from an outside perspective.,60,,
285,0.97,1559.524,1561.593,We think it's all Sdci.,60,,
286,0.97,1561.593,1567.232,"In reality, they have to also get review desks to return permits from outside of their Department.",60,,
287,0.97,1567.232,1569.501,Including the fire Marshal's office.,60,,
288,0.97,1569.501,1571.903,Seattle city light and Seattle public utilities.,60,,
289,0.97,1571.903,1576.708,One challenge that faces all three departments is the lack of contingent budget authority.,60,,
290,0.97,1576.708,1587.819,"Meaning that if they see increased permits, permit levels that they would be able to higher more staff on a contingent basis.",60,,
291,0.97,1587.819,1600.265,"When more per Miss applications come in, Sdci has contingent budget authority and position authority to used increased fee revenue to bring on more staff Scaling up alongside permit values.",60,,
292,0.97,1600.265,1607.639,Other departments that review permits have the same contingent budget authority many don't leading to staffing shortages and permit Backlogs today.,60,,
293,0.97,1607.639,1609.474,This budget amendment does several things.,60,,
294,0.97,1609.474,1616.181,First it adds position authority to add permit reviewers in the fire Marshal's office.,60,,
295,0.97,1616.181,1618.483,Seattle public utilities and Seattle city light.,60,,
296,0.97,1618.483,1629.561,Second it requests the CBO make recommendations for any adjustments to fee schedules or Fung structures that would be needed to fill the positions in future years.,60,,
297,0.97,1629.561,1638.303,And finally because the fire Marshal's office has been identified as one of the bottlenecks that currently exists.,60,,
298,0.97,1638.303,1644.909,"It was hard to necessarily determine of all of the review desks, if we were to add one staff member, which would it be?",60,,
299,0.97,1644.909,1649.481,The fire Marshal's office has risen to that level.,60,,
300,0.97,1649.481,1658.39,And I don't think that we should be waiting for future years to increase staffing capacity at the fire Marshal's office.,60,,
301,0.97,1658.39,1668.299,"Because they do so much from investigating, you know, suspicious fires to providing certificates of occupancy for buildings to open.",60,,
302,0.97,1668.299,1683.948,And this one-time funding will allow the fire Marshal's office to fill the new position this year while we work to establish the necessary enterprise fund fee schedules and road map to faster permit turn around times as part of the package of all three amendments.,60,,
303,0.97,1683.948,1688.286,"That was a lot, chair, I will endeavor to be shorter in my future remarks.",60,,
304,0.97,1688.286,1689.554,Thank you.,60,,
305,0.97,1689.554,1696.027,"That's okay, thank you so much Councilmember Strauss, are there any questions?",61,,
306,0.97,1696.027,1697.896,002 Sdci.,61,,
307,0.97,1698.797,1700.065,"Okay Councilmember, thank you so much.",61,,
308,0.97,1700.065,1709.007,I appreciate you noting the delays folks have been experiencing are also not just Jermaine to the staffing needs at Sdci.,61,,
309,0.97,1709.007,1715.28,So it looks like you're trying to address multiple departments here in the ways these departments intersect.,61,,
310,0.97,1715.28,1716.114,Thank you very much.,61,,
311,0.97,1716.114,1721.686,Let's move on to Sdci 003.,61,,
312,0.97,1721.686,1727.225,"Sdci 3A 1 would add $164,000 in general fund support.",62,,
313,0.97,1727.225,1733.932,Strategic adviser two to the Seattle Department of construction and inspections to facilitate permitting for child care facilities.,62,,
314,0.97,1733.932,1742.407,This is similar to a small business Facilitator position proposed to be added in the 2022 budget.,62,,
315,0.97,1742.407,1751.75,The understanding that this position would work not only with private applicants but also in conjunction with a deal and the human services Department.,62,,
316,0.97,1751.75,1757.021,This amendment is sponsored by Council President Gonzales.,62,,
317,0.97,1757.021,1761.392,And cosponsored by Councilmembers Pedersen and Strauss.,62,,
318,0.97,1761.392,1764.162,"Thank you Council President, please go ahead.",63,,
319,0.97,1764.162,1765.763,"Sure, thanks so much.",64,,
320,0.97,1765.763,1780.011,"Earlier this year, during a meeting of my Governance and education Committee, we heard from a large panel of child care providers who shared their experiences of the difficulties in navigating the city's permitting process.",64,,
321,0.97,1780.011,1796.06,"For one provider, they shared that it--they had been waiting 295 days before seeing any sort of progress on their permit.",64,,
322,0.97,1796.06,1802.367,"During those 295 days, they were paying rent on a space they were waiting to build out due to the need to relocate their child care center.",64,,
323,0.97,1802.367,1811.376,And we just heard last week actually that they finally received their permit and will be able to start construction on updating the space to make it appropriate for child care.,64,,
324,0.97,1811.376,1816.447,This is a provider that serves 600 families in northeast Seattle.,64,,
325,0.97,1816.447,1821.052,Including health care workers at Seattle children's hospital.,64,,
326,0.97,1821.052,1828.293,And what we know is that this one story from this one provider is not unique.,64,,
327,0.97,1828.293,1847.846,These long delays seem to be a chronic issue within our permitting systems and really do appreciate Councilmember Strauss lifting up the need to do more Holl Holistic changes.,64,,
328,0.97,1847.846,1850.615,But in the interim.,64,,
329,0.97,1850.615,1854.652,Our providers need this to help them through the bureaucracy and red tape that exists.,64,,
330,0.97,1854.652,1864.796,"And that makes it difficult for them to get through the permitting process to stand up the much needed child care facilities that our families, our working families need.",64,,
331,0.97,1864.796,1878.61,"So as a result of all of this work, it's become clear to me that there's a need to help these child care providers with this part of their operations.",64,,
332,0.97,1878.61,1896.094,And advancing this particular amendment in the hopes that this will support the efforts to speed up access development and the opening of new child care facilities in neighborhoods across the city.,64,,
333,0.97,1896.094,1900.398,Thank you Council President additional comments or questions.,65,,
334,0.97,1904.569,1913.244,"So you see, you see this item duck tailing with Councilmember Strauss' amendment that looks more broadly.",65,,
335,0.97,1913.244,1919.417,"The changes you're seeing in the meantime, can we identify a few folks specific to child care?",65,,
336,0.97,1919.417,1919.651,Right.,65,,
337,0.97,1919.651,1927.892,So this would have to be folks who understand the child care permitting process.,65,,
338,0.97,1927.892,1932.53,Which is its own body of complexity.,65,,
339,0.97,1932.53,1955.119,"And I think that this is again sort of an interim meet the needs kind of a proposal while the work that Councilmember Strauss is proposing, which I am supportive of that looks at sort of the broader reforms that could be necessary in our permitting review times, you know, sort of takes place.",65,,
340,0.97,1955.119,1960.124,"I mean, we all know that the study is not going to happen over night and it's going to take some time.",65,,
341,0.97,1960.124,1968.466,"So while we are waiting for that work to be done, our child care providers are still being required to go it Ameen.",65,,
342,0.97,1968.466,1969.701,On the permitting process.,65,,
343,0.97,1969.701,1981.112,And that's really slowing down the opportunity to open up these critically important parts of our infrastructure that is so essential for our working families.,65,,
344,0.97,1981.112,1992.056,"So that, you know, the child care provider that I just gave an example, they waited basically the entirety of a year, almost a year before being able to actually get to the permitting process.",65,,
345,0.97,1992.056,1993.157,And that's just too long.,65,,
346,0.97,1993.157,2006.504,"And we heard clearly from them, and from the agency that if they had someone in place who could actually be that Connector and that Facilitator that that would certainly help those processes along.",65,,
347,0.97,2006.504,2009.04,Thank you Council President.,66,,
348,0.97,2009.04,2009.307,Okay.,67,,
349,0.97,2009.307,2010.541,I appreciate it.,67,,
350,0.97,2010.541,2020.685,"Council President, and Councilmember Strauss, let's move on to Scci number four.",67,,
351,0.97,2020.685,2037.969,Scci four A1 is the statement of legislative intent requesting the cement Department of construction and inspections convene a Stakeholder group to provide a report to the Council on design report outcomes the Stakeholder group would conduct a racial equity tool kit analysis of the program.,68,,
352,0.97,2037.969,2045.61,And provide findings on a variety of different factors that are specified in the statement of legislative intent.,68,,
353,0.97,2045.61,2051.983,The report will be due to the committee by the end of the second quarter in 2022.,68,,
354,0.97,2051.983,2053.484,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,69,,
355,0.97,2053.484,2054.252,Please go ahead.,69,,
356,0.97,2054.252,2055.853,"Thank you, chair.",70,,
357,0.97,2055.853,2061.592,This is the third piece of that Holistic look at permitting.,70,,
358,0.97,2061.592,2069.634,And I was honored to get to sign off on the President's story about child care.,70,,
359,0.97,2069.634,2080.144,It's a story being experienced by many people all across the city.,70,,
360,0.97,2080.144,2082.847,This statement of legislative intent is specifically about design review.,70,,
361,0.97,2082.847,2087.852,And creating a report about the process.,70,,
362,0.97,2087.852,2093.324,It requests Sdci convene a Stakeholder group and prepare a report on outcomes from the design review program.,70,,
363,0.97,2093.324,2106.737,We hear from many constituents that the current design review program is often Weaponized to slow development or lacks the teeth to make real impact it is intended to have.,70,,
364,0.97,2106.737,2109.841,"So on one side, it's moving too slow.",70,,
365,0.97,2109.841,2115.646,"On the other side, it doesn't have the tools it needs to make the impact it was designed for.",70,,
366,0.97,2115.646,2132.296,"And so that's why this sly request for an inclusive Stakeholder group of community members, design professionals, housing advocates and more, it also requests racial equity tool kit to be completed to analyze the equity impacts of design review.",70,,
367,0.97,2132.296,2140.638,And finally the report should include recommendations for the city to make legislative and process changes to improve design review outcomes.,70,,
368,0.97,2140.638,2146.911,The goal is to improve the process and that's what we're trying to find out through this report.,70,,
369,0.97,2146.911,2147.345,"Thank you, chair.",70,,
370,0.97,2147.345,2151.115,"Thank you very much, any additional questions.",71,,
371,0.97,2151.115,2153.951,"Hearing none, let's go on to number five.",71,,
372,0.97,2153.951,2164.529,So moving on here to protection amendments.,72,,
373,0.97,2164.529,2165.363,Sdci 5A1.,72,,
374,0.97,2165.363,2166.364,"Approximately $271,000.",72,,
375,0.97,2166.364,2176.474,And two Fde Environmentalist analysts to the Seattle Department of construction and inspections to implement an enforced tree protection regulation.,72,,
376,0.97,2176.474,2179.076,One position would be added to the compliance side.,72,,
377,0.97,2179.076,2183.414,Another added to the review side of Stci.,72,,
378,0.97,2183.414,2192.723,If the amendment is sponsored by Councilmember Strauss cosponsored by Councilmembers Pedersen and Lewis.,72,,
379,0.97,2192.723,2196.26,"Thank you chair, thank you Keetle.",73,,
380,0.97,2196.26,2200.264,And thank you colleagues for indulging me in this conversation.,73,,
381,0.97,2200.264,2201.966,I have so many amendments.,73,,
382,0.97,2201.966,2218.683,So this amendment will add funding for two additional Arborists at Sdci who will be responsible for both enforcing the current tree regulations and reviewing permit applications to ensure tree preservation and compliance with the tree code.,73,,
383,0.97,2218.683,2226.657,Doubling the current number of Arborists allowing them to review permit applications and Proactively protect our trees.,73,,
384,0.97,2226.657,2246.544,"As we get closer to seeing the long awaited tree protection ordinance proposal by the end of the year, providing Sdci with additional resources up front will strengthen our enforcement while we implement the long-term protections and will ensure that the Department has the capacity they need to enforce new tree protections when their adopted.",73,,
385,0.97,2246.544,2247.111,"Thank you, chair.",73,,
386,0.97,2247.945,2269.7,"Thank you, just a quick question for me, can you remind me what the anticipated date of passage is or Timeframe for passage of that tree ordinance and given that the tree ordinance has--still needs to pass our Council, is it that these positions will be needed for the Timeframe after the passage or for the full year.",74,,
387,0.97,2269.7,2275.106,"Thank you, chair, Councilmember Pedersen, do you want to answer the Timeline question?",75,,
388,0.97,2275.106,2277.208,I joke to a certain degree.,75,,
389,0.97,2277.208,2285.149,Councilmember Pedersen and I have been banging on the door to get the tree ordinance that we don't have a Timeline for quite frankly.,75,,
390,0.97,2285.149,2297.928,And so the tree ordinance at best will go out for Cipa by the end of the year in which we'll have a draft to be able to review.,75,,
391,0.97,2297.928,2305.269,"So to answer your question, frankly, about when is the tree ordinance passing, it's a question that we don't know the answer to.",75,,
392,0.97,2305.269,2309.94,And it's frustrated myself and I I know Councilmember Pedersen as well.,75,,
393,0.97,2309.94,2313.644,Worked with the Councilmember on this amendment as well.,75,,
394,0.97,2313.644,2319.784,Because the Arborists are needed with or without the tree ordinance.,75,,
395,0.97,2319.784,2328.392,The Arborists have the job of approving or denying permits for removing exceptional trees on private property that will be developed.,75,,
396,0.97,2328.392,2344.141,And then they also have the duty of enforcing and sending to the law Department their analysis when trees are illegally cut where the law Department then establishes a fine that that property owner has to pay.,75,,
397,0.97,2344.141,2347.078,So the Arborist plays a really important role in our city.,75,,
398,0.97,2347.078,2351.015,We don't have enough of them.,75,,
399,0.97,2351.015,2359.657,"And just by adding to, we double the size of our Sdci Arborists.",75,,
400,0.97,2360.257,2365.196,Happy to say more if you'd like.,75,,
401,0.97,2365.196,2369.6,It's a my general pitch on the Arborists.,75,,
402,0.97,2369.6,2374.905,"Councilmember Pedersen, anything to add to that?",76,,
403,0.97,2374.905,2383.748,"Nothing to add, chair Mosqueda, the timing is uncertain about when the tree protection regulations will come.",77,,
404,0.97,2383.748,2391.455,"It could be--if Cipa is published, before the end of the year, it could be at Council by the end of the first quarter.",77,,
405,0.97,2392.49,2396.494,"Okay, thank you very much.",78,,
406,0.97,2398.162,2400.131,I'm not seeing any additional questions on this.,78,,
407,0.97,2400.131,2407.605,We can move on to the next item if you'd like.,78,,
408,0.97,2407.605,2429.86,"Fdci 6a one would impose a proviso on $865,000 worth of appropriations in Sdci for updated tree protection regulations the proviso would be on the government policy safety and support budget summary level which is where appropriations for code development work are made.",79,,
409,0.97,2429.86,2436.5,This is a proviso on approximately 1/3 of the appropriations at the budget summary level.,79,,
410,0.97,2436.5,2442.273,The proviso would be lifted automatically with transmit tall of protection regulations to the Council.,79,,
411,0.97,2443.14,2446.577,"Excuse me, please go ahead, Councilmember Pedersen.",80,,
412,0.97,2446.577,2467.097,"Thank you, chair, picking up on the theme discussed earlier, the purpose of this is really a conditional proviso just to ensure that the executive complies with resolution 31902 by deliver delivering an updated tree protection ordinance, we're hopeful we'll receive this tree protection ordinance this year.",81,,
413,0.97,2467.097,2470.401,In which case the proviso would not go into effect.,81,,
414,0.97,2470.401,2475.873,"Just in case we don't receive it by the end of the calendar year, we know the executive administrations are changing.",81,,
415,0.97,2475.873,2486.884,This would be a back-up proviso to ensure that we ultimately receive it with the change that's happening with the executive administration.,81,,
416,0.97,2488.085,2492.556,"Thank you, additional questions or comments? wonderful.",81,,
417,0.97,2493.09,2496.527,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Pedersen.",81,,
418,0.97,2496.527,2502.766,"Okay, let's move on to Sdci 007.",81,,
419,0.97,2503.501,2524.154,"The next set of amendments have to do with Sdci's function as a regulate Tar of residential landlords and a provider of tenant services, Sdci 751 would add $200,000 of Department of construction and inspections for consultant report for a rental market study that analyzes the current market and how it's changed over time.",81,,
420,0.97,2524.154,2529.894,And also looks at how ownership of rental units has changed over time.,81,,
421,0.97,2529.894,2537.001,The proposed amendment sponsored by Councilmember Strauss and cosponsored by Councilmembers Morales and Lewis.,81,,
422,0.97,2537.001,2539.57,Please go ahead Councilmember Strauss.,82,,
423,0.97,2539.57,2556.186,"Thank you, chair, this Council budget action would add $200,000 to Sdci for consultant support for rental market study that analyzes the current market and how it's changed over time including an analysis of how ownership of rental units has changed.",83,,
424,0.97,2556.186,2569.667,"Our housing market is ever evolving with the amount of development that has occurred over the last decade, the influx of people moving to the city, and the housing regulations we passed over the last several years we need to better understand how the market has changed.",83,,
425,0.97,2569.667,2574.138,We've also heard from small landlords that they're leaving the market due to regulations.,83,,
426,0.97,2574.138,2581.579,We need the data to see if the data is true and to inform decisions around development and regulations.,83,,
427,0.97,2581.579,2586.617,We rely on the surveys to keep track of this rental housing information.,83,,
428,0.97,2586.617,2589.92,"Unfortunately, they shut down in 2018.",83,,
429,0.97,2589.92,2601.165,So this Council budget action is--it's the way to replace that data source and provide us with better information to inform our decisions here at Council and create good policy.,83,,
430,0.97,2601.165,2602.199,"Thank you, chair.",83,,
431,0.97,2602.199,2607.938,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, I want to welcome Councilmember Morales back to the committee.",84,,
432,0.97,2607.938,2615.98,Thank you very much Councilmember Morales for being here.,84,,
433,0.97,2615.98,2617.214,We're on Sdci 107.,84,,
434,0.97,2617.214,2635.199,"Just a quick question as this relates--does this relate to the earlier conversation we had about analyzing the short-term rental units that might be available on the market, can you remind me how these two may intersect?",84,,
435,0.97,2635.199,2636.8,They intersect by proximity.,85,,
436,0.97,2636.8,2648.278,I would say that we did not bring them together as a package rather it is both separate and important pieces of information.,85,,
437,0.97,2648.278,2648.479,Okay.,85,,
438,0.97,2648.479,2651.715,"Thanks, Keetle, anything else to add.",85,,
439,0.97,2651.715,2654.652,They're somewhat Di stink bodies of work.,86,,
440,0.97,2654.652,2660.958,Something that's a short-term rental may or may not be a rental unit that's out there on the market more broadly.,86,,
441,0.97,2660.958,2664.194,So it may not be subject to regulation.,86,,
442,0.97,2664.194,2672.236,So I think that they actually get to sort of two different questions.,86,,
443,0.97,2672.236,2674.038,And are potentially complimentary.,86,,
444,0.97,2674.038,2677.274,Depending on the outcomes of these budget actions next year.,86,,
445,0.97,2678.642,2681.245,Thank you very much.,87,,
446,0.97,2681.245,2684.248,"Please go ahead, Councilmember Pedersen.",87,,
447,0.97,2684.248,2686.917,I'd like to sign on as a cosponsor to this.,88,,
448,0.97,2686.917,2693.857,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Pedersen.",89,,
449,0.97,2693.857,2696.126,"Councilmember Pedersen, Sdci 007.",89,,
450,0.97,2696.126,2696.76,Thanks Councilmember Pedersen.,89,,
451,0.97,2696.76,2702.933,Let's move on to 008.,89,,
452,0.97,2702.933,2711.842,"Sdci would add $152,000 in general Fund and one strategic adviser.",89,,
453,0.97,2711.842,2714.745,One for monitoring assessment and prevention.,89,,
454,0.97,2714.745,2722.186,"Data collection, it's envisioned that this position would do data collection.",89,,
455,0.97,2722.186,2722.719,In house.,89,,
456,0.97,2722.719,2722.986,At Sdci.,89,,
457,0.97,2722.986,2735.632,Potentially through a survey of participants in the city's rental registration inspection--provided by participants in that program.,89,,
458,0.97,2735.632,2739.77,Sponsored by Councilmember Pedersen and cosponsored by Morales and Gonzales.,89,,
459,0.97,2739.77,2743.14,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Pedersen.",90,,
460,0.97,2743.14,2744.942,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,91,,
461,0.97,2744.942,2762.025,We did a statement of legislative intent last year which is leading to this request for one FTE which would enable us to implement an in House data gathering and monitoring system to track economic and physical displacement of lower income households.,91,,
462,0.97,2762.025,2767.998,Right now there's a problematic lack of Granularity at census track data.,91,,
463,0.97,2767.998,2774.605,And there's an absent of detailed--or a shortage of detailed rental survey firms in the private sector.,91,,
464,0.97,2774.605,2777.508,This is confirmed by the slide we did last year.,91,,
465,0.97,2777.508,2784.581,"This would enable in House data, which a city of this size should have I believe.",91,,
466,0.97,2784.581,2798.061,Data gathering would likely need to be accomplished by asking apartment owners to provide rent summaries so that we know nothing personally identifiable.,91,,
467,0.97,2798.061,2799.596,But we know the unit size.,91,,
468,0.97,2799.596,2803.3,"Whether it's--how many bathrooms, how many bed rooms, the rent that's being charged.",91,,
469,0.97,2803.3,2810.34,"And then over time, we can track whether there's been displacement, whether rent's been going up or down.",91,,
470,0.97,2810.34,2813.977,The naturally occurring affordable housing is one of the tougher things to track.,91,,
471,0.97,2813.977,2818.182,And this would enable us to do that.,91,,
472,0.97,2818.182,2822.085,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",92,,
473,0.97,2822.085,2822.619,Councilmember Herbold.,92,,
474,0.97,2822.619,2826.356,I'd like to add my name to this proposal as well.,93,,
475,0.97,2826.356,2839.67,"This was a need that was also identified in a recent city audit by the office of--well, the audit was done by the city auditor but the need was identified by the office of housing.",93,,
476,0.97,2839.67,2846.043,The audit itself was on the city's notice of intent to sell ordinance.,93,,
477,0.97,2851.615,2855.118,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Herbold.",93,,
478,0.97,2855.118,2859.59,"Wonderful, let's keep moving.",93,,
479,0.97,2859.59,2873.437,Fdci 9a 1 a statement of legislative intent would request the Seattle Department of construction and inspections convene a staff and Stakeholder group to advise the city on regulatory and rental market challenges for small landlords.,94,,
480,0.97,2873.437,2887.885,Ideally the group would identify whether changes to city regulation market trends have disparate impacts on small landlord as report from the Stakeholder group would be due to the Finance and housing committee by July 5th 2022.,94,,
481,0.97,2887.885,2897.861,"This is sponsored by Councilmember Lewis and cosponsored by, Pedersen and Strauss.",94,,
482,0.97,2897.861,2898.195,Wonder.,95,,
483,0.97,2898.195,2900.264,Please go ahead Councilmember Lewis.,95,,
484,0.97,2900.264,2901.465,Thank you Madame chair.,96,,
485,0.97,2901.465,2904.968,And thank you for Cueing that up.,96,,
486,0.97,2904.968,2920.183,"So, you know, the Council rightly so over the course of the pandemic has passed a very large amount of tenant protection legislation creating one of the more equitable environments in the country to be a Renter.",96,,
487,0.97,2920.183,2932.329,And this is critical in a Renner dominated city that we be centering policies that protect and expand the rights of Renters.,96,,
488,0.97,2932.329,2945.475,But one thing that we have heard quite consistently throughout the process of creating those laws is the aggregating impact of creating new conditions that small landlords need to operate in.,96,,
489,0.97,2945.475,2954.885,I don't see this as an exercise of revising or changing those regulations that are essential or those rights that are fundamental to being a tenant.,96,,
490,0.97,2954.885,2966.63,But I do see this as an opportunity to figure out ways that we can create support and assistance for compliance.,96,,
491,0.97,2966.63,3005.235,"We know, for example, as mentioned in--there's a recent paper from Harvard's joint center for studies that looked at the impact particularly of the pandemic on small landlords and found the pandemic has had an ill pack on the supply of naturally affordable rentals and it noticed that small landlords in particular have certain management practices that don't have the benefit that corporate landlords have of massive compliance bureaucracies that can help to streamline and absorb the impact of some of these regulations.",96,,
492,0.97,3005.235,3011.341,This has particularly been Photoed to have an impact on the ability to access emergency rental assistance.,96,,
493,0.97,3011.341,3027.09,We've seen that even in our region of having a difficulty of getting a massive amount of rent assistance out the door and into the hands of tenants and landlords desperately in need of that kind of support.,96,,
494,0.97,3027.09,3048.512,So this gives us an opportunity to make some space to convene and talk about how we can work through some of these implementation issues with Sdci and what kind of resources and support the city might be in a position to provide to assist with compliance.,96,,
495,0.97,3048.512,3057.721,I would add we do similar acts when employers are not compliance with city labor standards seeking compliance is the first step before seeking sanction.,96,,
496,0.97,3057.721,3070.534,This could be an opportunity to really look into ways we can do that and make sure that some of these valid concerns that have been raised by small landlords are something that can be addressed by Sdci.,96,,
497,0.97,3071.134,3084.881,"Thank you very much, are there any additional questions or comments? please go ahead, Councilmember Sawant.",97,,
498,0.97,3088.151,3089.453,Councilmember Sawant.,97,,
499,0.97,3089.453,3089.753,I'm sorry.,97,,
500,0.97,3089.753,3090.954,We're on mute still.,97,,
501,0.97,3090.954,3091.822,Sorry.,98,,
502,0.97,3092.289,3097.094,Thank you for letting me know.,98,,
503,0.97,3097.094,3131.795,"I wanted to say that if the--if the idea is to allow small landlords to better understand the legal requirements or also opportunities, rental assistance compliance with current law, all of that of course is--but it's not clear to me, especially from the public comment that we had today or from the language of the statement of legislative intent is that is what it will be limited to.",98,,
504,0.97,3131.795,3143.473,And I would be extremely concerned if there is any other--if it's not stated very clearly what the goal of this so-called Stakeholder group is.,98,,
505,0.97,3143.473,3151.314,"And I'll be very honest, I don't actually believe that that will be the goal.",98,,
506,0.97,3151.314,3155.752,"What the actual Stakeholder group, if it was set up would do.",98,,
507,0.97,3155.752,3161.791,Other than provide a platform to landlords for opposing any progress on Renter's rights.,98,,
508,0.97,3161.791,3178.241,"I mean, in truth, if a landlord, small or big, does not Gouge their tenants, if they support Renter's rights, which includes rent control, meaning rent increase being legal but no more than the inflation rate, then why do landlords need such a platform?",98,,
509,0.97,3178.241,3187.284,"Because the status quo--and I should repeat, it's the overwhelming status quo in every city around the nation.",98,,
510,0.97,3187.284,3187.717,Including Seattle.,98,,
511,0.97,3187.717,3191.321,The housing market is deeply SKEWED against Renters.,98,,
512,0.97,3191.321,3202.232,My office is contacted by tenants from across the city almost on a daily basis who are exploited by mostly big landlord corporations.,98,,
513,0.97,3202.232,3216.379,"So just in terms of where the overwhelming priority of the city council should be, I just don't understand why we would do this.",98,,
514,0.97,3216.379,3218.582,It would amplify the power of landlords.,98,,
515,0.97,3218.582,3233.463,"We heard today in public comment, Cory brewer, who is a wind mere representative, Ousing rental units in Seattle, speaking in support of this So- called small landlord Stakeholder group and asking to be part of it.",98,,
516,0.97,3233.463,3235.765,My office met with Cory brewer.,98,,
517,0.97,3235.765,3237.5,He will imply we haven't.,98,,
518,0.97,3237.5,3237.767,We have.,98,,
519,0.97,3237.767,3238.001,Twice.,98,,
520,0.97,3238.001,3240.537,Once this year and once a couple years ago.,98,,
521,0.97,3240.537,3243.006,The problem is not we don't meet with them.,98,,
522,0.97,3243.006,3245.942,The problem is we don't agree with their position.,98,,
523,0.97,3245.942,3254.651,It's Unstate Bud it's a position that they should get to Gouge Renters and that the city Council and specifically my office should not fight for Renter's rights.,98,,
524,0.97,3254.651,3275.105,"Remember that over the summer when Renters were fighting for their rights the Seattle times published and my office has brought over multiple legislation that I'm glad that the Council has passed, you know, either unanimously or overwhelming majority that has been very important.",98,,
525,0.97,3275.105,3281.077,"But during that time, the Seattle times published two Op- Eds from Cory brewer.",98,,
526,0.97,3281.077,3281.878,He's an example.,98,,
527,0.97,3281.878,3284.314,He's just a more vocal opponent.,98,,
528,0.97,3284.314,3286.883,But he represents the voice of corporate landlords.,98,,
529,0.97,3286.883,3295.859,The Seattle times published two Op-Eds by him in opposition to Renters rights and published an editorial that quoted him against the Renters rights.,98,,
530,0.97,3295.859,3301.831,"When was the last time the Seattle times published Op-Eds from Renters, that's the platform they have.",98,,
531,0.97,3301.831,3307.003,Renters need to get organized to get any measure of justice in the for profit housing market.,98,,
532,0.97,3307.003,3313.743,And Renters have won crucial victories this year and also since 2016 only because of that kind of organizing.,98,,
533,0.97,3313.743,3321.985,With thousands of Renters priced out of their homes by rent increases on track to exceed 40% on average.,98,,
534,0.97,3321.985,3325.955,"I mean, this is just mind Boggling.",98,,
535,0.97,3325.955,3327.524,40% rent increases on track for this year.,98,,
536,0.97,3327.524,3334.531,And it's still illegal because of the state Legislature to pass any form of rent control any where in Washington state.,98,,
537,0.97,3334.531,3340.303,It's just so crystal clear that landlords do not need even more influence and power.,98,,
538,0.97,3340.303,3342.906,Renters feed more power.,98,,
539,0.97,3342.906,3350.98,"And if small landlords are not Gowning their tenants, as I said before, I'm not sure what the purpose of the Stakeholder group would be.",98,,
540,0.97,3350.98,3358.088,"If it's merely to advise on compliance on existing--on Curne law, then we should say it and limit it to that.",98,,
541,0.97,3358.088,3360.09,But I don't believe that's what the goal is.,98,,
542,0.97,3360.09,3362.859,At least of the small landlords.,98,,
543,0.97,3362.859,3366.463,Or the landlords who are supporting this.,98,,
544,0.97,3366.463,3370.7,Landlords have been vocally opposing Eviction moratoriums.,98,,
545,0.97,3370.7,3375.238,And some who call themselves small landlords have also opposed it.,98,,
546,0.97,3375.238,3376.473,I don't agree.,98,,
547,0.97,3376.473,3379.776,Just because they're small doesn't mean they get to exploit tenants.,98,,
548,0.97,3379.776,3382.345,We're in a massive crisis.,98,,
549,0.97,3382.345,3387.25,Working class Renters are some of the most effective people in society.,98,,
550,0.97,3387.25,3393.656,Among the working class Renters who are disproportionately most affected.,98,,
551,0.97,3393.656,3405.935,"It's black families, especially black single woman led households . We're talking about the most vulnerable people who get caught up in this racket of Evictions and other kinds of exploitation of Renters.",98,,
552,0.97,3405.935,3428.324,"And the Op-Eds in the settle times demonstrate that even if landlords were to be made of small landlords, it will still be Weaponized by big landlords and big business to give to the legitimacy of the opposition.",98,,
553,0.97,3428.324,3432.662,No listened Lord has the right to Gouge or exploit working class Renters.,98,,
554,0.97,3432.662,3435.565,I wanted to share the city's action Fund.,98,,
555,0.97,3435.565,3446.409,Thank them for Email they sent this morning which questions spending scarce resources and staff time on small landlords in a new round table.,98,,
556,0.97,3446.409,3448.978,And we support them.,98,,
557,0.97,3448.978,3459.489,They say we question when what we need is a transparent rental Registry so everyone knows if who they write their check to is part of a larger company or not.,98,,
558,0.97,3459.489,3464.761,And I support that.,98,,
559,0.97,3464.761,3465.929,Okay.,99,,
560,0.97,3465.929,3469.199,Councilmember Sawant.,99,,
561,0.97,3469.199,3472.368,Let's move on.,99,,
562,0.97,3472.368,3478.775,Sdci 0 Soh A1 would add $1.5 million to Sdci.,100,,
563,0.97,3478.775,3490.253,"And 1.5 to code compliance analysts for information technology start up costs, outreach, ongoing staffing to implement ordinance 126541.",100,,
564,0.97,3490.253,3493.957,Relocation assistance ordinance that passed in September.,100,,
565,0.97,3493.957,3497.327,Sponsored by Councilmember Sawant.,100,,
566,0.97,3497.327,3498.461,Cosponsored by Councilmembers Pedersen and Lewis.,100,,
567,0.97,3498.461,3504.3,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,101,,
568,0.97,3505.602,3507.103,Thank you.,102,,
569,0.97,3507.103,3528.258,"And I also thank the cosponsors, Councilmember Lewis and Pedersen for their support on September 27th, the Council unanimously passed economic displacement relocation assistance ordinance to protect Renters facing economic Evictions the legislation pass Richmond the same day the Mayor released her budgets.",102,,
570,0.97,3528.258,3530.56,The administration could not be included in the budget.,102,,
571,0.97,3530.56,3534.998,"But as a matter of fact, the timing did not work.",102,,
572,0.97,3534.998,3557.086,"The Sdci the Department of construction inspections has indicated that it would require other a million or $200,000 in one-time funds to do the initial set up of the infrastructure to administer this program, particularly, a User-Friendly cell phone and computer Online portal where Renters can apply for relocation assistance.",102,,
573,0.97,3557.086,3560.49,This is very important in the law.,102,,
574,0.97,3560.49,3564.46,The legislation passed by the city council recently.,102,,
575,0.97,3564.46,3576.706,Is good because--and this was done actually on the advisement of the Sdci which was really appreciated where the Renters can get their--their compensation from the Department.,102,,
576,0.97,3576.706,3578.741,They don't have to struggle with their landlord.,102,,
577,0.97,3578.741,3581.945,And the landlord Haves to pay the DCI.,102,,
578,0.97,3581.945,3585.481,So the DCI has to do that kind of administration.,102,,
579,0.97,3585.481,3596.225,"They have also indicated the they would require almost $200,000 in ongoing funding for staffing to actually process those relocation assistance applications.",102,,
580,0.97,3596.225,3600.897,This is consistent as I said with the fiscal note of the legislation when it was passed.,102,,
581,0.97,3600.897,3616.112,I believe that the administration funds are particularly important for the program because the legislation as I said was written for Sdci so they're an intermediary in all relocation assistance payments.,102,,
582,0.97,3616.112,3624.621,As they collect the relocation fee and pay the Renter it avoids the Renter being denied their right by terrible power imbalance.,102,,
583,0.97,3624.621,3631.127,And anyone who tried to get their security deposit back from the landlord knows about the power I balance.,102,,
584,0.97,3631.127,3632.161,Thank you.,102,,
585,0.97,3632.161,3635.498,Any additional comments or questions?,103,,

599,0.97,3701.597,3708.671,Many Council offices recommend--they call the Finance Union when they call Council offices for help.,106,,
600,0.97,3708.671,3726.355,To education Renters through their Hotline the housing justice project provides legal support and it's countless the number of times my office has been contacted by Renters who we have referred to housing projects office hours and again and again they were able to solve people's problems.,106,,
601,0.97,3726.355,3735.364,Just having the ability to connect with somebody who is an experienced Renter's rights Organizer.,106,,
602,0.97,3735.364,3742.038,And ultimately a trained attorney makes all the difference in the housing stability for a working class family.,106,,

604,0.97,3744.273,3748.478,"As I mentioned yesterday, my office joined the tenants last week.",106,,
605,0.97,3748.478,3753.616,This is a set of three buildings where nearly 10 tenants live.,106,,

607,0.97,3755.952,3759.822,Many of them are immigrants in communities of color.,106,,
608,0.97,3759.822,3773.87,And that--the beginning of that struggle has only been possible because we've had also the tenants Union in Seattle there with us to organize with the low income seniors.,106,,
609,0.97,3773.87,3784.347,"And honestly, this is in response to a question Councilmember Pedersen asked me, right now most of the efforts that we need to continue funding are about existing law.",106,,
610,0.97,3784.347,3790.286,Current law in helping tenants make sure that landlords comply with current law.,106,,
611,0.97,3790.286,3793.589,And that's--so this is an example of that kind of thing.,106,,
612,0.97,3793.589,3798.795,Where current law needs to be enforced.,106,,
613,0.97,3798.795,3803.499,"The Mayor's budget allocated 605,000 to fund the right to done sill for Renters facing Eviction.",106,,
614,0.97,3803.499,3824.887,"But the housing project believes that maybe as much as $400,000 too little, which means that either the Sdci will end up having to under fund the right to done sill or will have to cut funding to other organizations, supporting Renter education, which would then not work out because Renters also need that kind of help in order to navigate the system.",106,,
615,0.97,3824.887,3827.156,In order to deal with the problems that come up.,106,,
616,0.97,3827.156,3833.996,So this budget amendment will ensure that Renters education would not face cuts.,106,,

662,0.97,3962.758,3968.331,Obcd has been read into the record.,119,,
663,0.97,3968.331,3973.369,Obcd number one.,119,,
664,0.97,3973.369,3975.271,Good afternoon.,120,,
665,0.97,3975.271,3980.543,"Add 620,000-Dollar of General fund to the office of funding community development.",120,,

667,0.97,3986.983,3987.616,And proviso.,120,,
668,0.97,3987.616,3994.724,The primary sponsor is Councilmember Strauss and cosponsors are chair Mosqueda and Council President Gonzales.,120,,
669,0.97,3994.724,4008.27,"This would provide a total of $750,000 between 2021 and 2022 for environmental impact statement for the next major update to the comprehensive plan.",120,,
670,0.97,4008.27,4008.838,"$300,000 for outreach.",120,,
671,0.97,4008.838,4022.451,And stay Staph thousand dollars for historic preservation studies and impose a proviso that requires them to study alternatives such as changes to residential or single family areas.,120,,
672,0.97,4022.451,4031.694,Studying 15 minute neighborhoods and studying other displacement too Manys as alternatives in--for the city strategy for accommodating growth.,120,,
673,0.97,4031.694,4034.864,Over the next 20 years.,120,,
674,0.97,4034.864,4040.436,And it requires Opcd to return to Council after the process to talk about what they've decided to study.,120,,
675,0.97,4041.537,4044.507,Thank you very much.,121,,
676,0.97,4044.507,4046.208,"Councilmember Strauss, please go ahead.",121,,
677,0.97,4046.208,4050.579,I understand this was a little bit more lengthy too.,121,,
678,0.97,4050.579,4051.614,Please go ahead.,121,,
679,0.97,4051.614,4053.716,"Thank you, care.",122,,
680,0.97,4053.716,4053.983,Mosqueda.,122,,
681,0.97,4053.983,4057.42,And Luckily I've only got three more amendments to talk through today.,122,,
682,0.97,4057.42,4058.32,I'll endeavor to be short.,122,,
683,0.97,4058.32,4060.823,But this is kind of longer.,122,,
684,0.97,4060.823,4064.226,I'm making sure I'm at the right one.,122,,
685,0.97,4064.226,4064.46,Yep.,122,,
686,0.97,4064.46,4080.709,"So this amendment adds the $745,000 to Opcd to increase resources for the comprehensive plan major update community outreach process and for the development of an environmental impact statement.",122,,
687,0.97,4080.709,4085.948,Councilmember Herbold and I joined Brian Callahan at the Seattle channel for inside out.,122,,
688,0.97,4085.948,4091.62,The question was asked about changes to the major update and what's going to happen.,122,,
689,0.97,4091.62,4102.565,"And what is going to happen is there's going to be a large amount of outreach, research, and analysis for us to be able to make informed decisions for this major update.",122,,
690,0.97,4102.565,4108.437,And this amendment is what is going to get us there.,122,,
691,0.97,4108.437,4116.378,"And there's another--so 200,000 will go to expanding the outreach effort for a total budget of $350,000.",122,,
692,0.97,4116.378,4124.453,Which is slightly higher than the budget for this last major update.,122,,
693,0.97,4124.453,4129.658,"$125,000 would fund work updating the historic resources inventory.",122,,
694,0.97,4129.658,4134.163,A necessary piece of the work that's currently not funded.,122,,
695,0.97,4134.163,4140.636,"And $420,000 would increase the total budget for the environmental impact statement to $750,000.",122,,
696,0.97,4140.636,4145.508,Which was the cost for the city wide mandatory housing Affordability.,122,,
697,0.97,4145.508,4148.31,Which is the closest comparison that we have.,122,,
698,0.97,4148.31,4168.731,"This amendment will also reimpose an existing proviso on a portion of the funds to require Opcd, the steady growth alternatives that allows for greater density in neighborhood residential areas and study alternatives including strategy to minimize displacement of low income and Bipoc communities.",122,,
699,0.97,4168.731,4177.273,This major update which will conclude in spring of 2024 is the most important opportunity we've had in a decade to shape the future growth of Seattle.,122,,
700,0.97,4177.273,4189.652,It will be our chance to have--to critically evaluate our current model of concentrating growth in urban villages and to consider what level of growth our neighborhood residential areas should take on.,122,,
701,0.97,4189.652,4206.302,It is crucial that we provide Opcd with the adequate engage with all communities across Seattle to inform the major updates and to rigorously study environmental impacts of the changes we consider.,122,,
702,0.97,4206.302,4212.341,"Additionally, this funding will make sure that there's not misinformation in our communities.",122,,
703,0.97,4212.341,4226.822,I spoke to somebody just this week who was concerned that changing the name to neighborhood residential would mean that there would be higher heights and larger density allowed in neighborhood residential zones.,122,,
704,0.97,4226.822,4238.133,"And I had to reaffirm them that my perspective at most would be to have Duplexes, Triplexes, Micro stores and garages and community, you know, shops.",122,,
705,0.97,4238.133,4244.74,In our neighborhoods so that we can have a 15-Minute Walkable community and get everything we need.,122,,
706,0.97,4244.74,4261.123,"And without funding that's contained within this amendment, I fear that we won't have the information available to us to research, analyze, and engage with our community to best understand how we should--and to best inform our decisions during this major update.",122,,
707,0.97,4261.824,4262.591,Thank you chair.,122,,
708,0.97,4262.591,4263.225,That is our report.,122,,
709,0.97,4264.059,4266.962,Thank you very much.,123,,
710,0.97,4266.962,4274.336,Do you have additional comments or questions on the side?,123,,
711,0.97,4274.336,4277.039,Okay.,123,,
712,0.97,4277.039,4280.342,Thank you Councilmember Strauss for the work you've done on this amendment here today.,123,,
713,0.97,4280.342,4291.954,This is an important next step in efforts to ensure the upcoming major comprehensive plan truly addresses displacement and Exclusionary zoning.,123,,
714,0.97,4291.954,4297.192,We need actionable policies that are rooted in community identified strategies.,123,,
715,0.97,4297.192,4303.699,And we can only get that if we have equitable and authentic community engagement.,123,,
716,0.97,4303.699,4335.931,As you noted in the 2019--the 2020 adopted budget that the council passed helped lay the ground work for the comprehensive plan updates that can lead to undoing these Exclusionary zoning legacies that are still Plaguing our system and address displacement by making sure that we're requiring the racial equity tool kit analysis that we received in your Committee Councilmember Strauss to be applied in our development of policies for the 2023 comprehensive plan that could pass in 2024.,123,,
717,0.97,4335.931,4373.602,But those conversations noted need to be grounded in the conversations that we began this year through the racial equity tool kit so that we're bringing community expertise and experience to the table so that we are continuing authentic engagement and looking at the data analysis that has all ready begun to be analyzed by community members and Pairing those quantitative reports with qualitative summaries from community about how we can improve housing diversity and address the environmental impacts of additional growth and development in our community through a racial equity Lense.,123,,
718,0.97,4373.602,4376.405,So I really appreciate the inclusion here.,123,,
719,0.97,4376.405,4399.361,"Because we don't want to have a situation where we've gone through this racial equity tool kit, have in depth conversations and focus groups that have, by the way, been really made possible through the important work of Opcd, through Puget sound Sage, through policy link, they have begun a wonderful engagement that has helped lead to that racial equity tool kit analysis.",123,,
720,0.97,4399.361,4402.164,And we cannot drop the ball on our community engagement now.,123,,
721,0.97,4402.164,4405.567,Now is the time for us to double down in terms of victims.,123,,
722,0.97,4405.567,4418.48,"If we were to move forward with the amount of investments in the budget alone, we would actually be reducing, in real dollars, in today's dollars, the amount of money that we're putting into conversations with community.",123,,
723,0.97,4418.48,4425.387,And that's where it does not align with our values to have policy changes informed by those most affected by the changes.,123,,
724,0.97,4425.387,4439.902,So I look forward to engaging with you on this larger body of work in 2022 for community engagement to develop the policies in 2023 so we can have a true comprehensive comprehensive plan update in 2024.,123,,
725,0.97,4439.902,4444.54,Any additional comments? thank you Councilmember.,123,,
726,0.97,4444.54,4445.073,"Strauss, let's continue.",123,,
727,0.97,4445.073,4445.908,Number two.,123,,
728,0.97,4445.908,4449.178,All right.,124,,
729,0.97,4449.178,4460.289,"Opcd 2A1 would add $162,000 and one FTE strategic adviser one to Opcd for the conference of planned public education effort.",124,,
730,0.97,4460.289,4463.959,The sponsor is Council President Gonzales.,124,,
731,0.97,4463.959,4467.496,With Councilmembers Morales and Strauss as cosponsors.,124,,
732,0.97,4467.496,4474.97,The difference between this one and the previous Council budget action is that this would add staff to Opcd.,124,,
733,0.97,4474.97,4482.277,The other is for consultant support for the comprehensive plan effort.,124,,
734,0.97,4483.378,4485.414,"Council President, please go ahead.",124,,
735,0.97,4485.414,4492.855,Would it be okay if I I address both items 2 and 3 together.,124,,
736,0.97,4492.855,4494.756,If that's all right with you Madame chair.,124,,
737,0.97,4494.756,4499.695,I can go ahead and take care of them both at one time.,124,,
738,0.97,4499.695,4504.766,"Sounds good, thank you.",125,,
739,0.97,4504.766,4507.669,And Keetle was the sponsor.,126,,
740,0.97,4507.669,4510.739,I see you on the line.,127,,
741,0.97,4510.739,4515.21,That COMPLETES Opcd 3A 1.,128,,
742,0.97,4515.21,4528.257,"Would add $130,000 in general Fund and one term limited strategic adviser one position to Opcd for comprehensive plan implementation.",128,,
743,0.97,4528.257,4534.429,It could be considered COB currently with comprehensive amendment adoption in 2024.,128,,
744,0.97,4534.429,4542.371,The position would sunset in 2024.,128,,
745,0.97,4542.371,4543.839,Cosponsored by Councilmembers Morales and Strauss.,128,,
746,0.97,4543.839,4545.307,"Go ahead, Council President.",129,,
747,0.97,4545.307,4551.179,"Great, thank you so much for indulging my request to take care of these at one time.",130,,
748,0.97,4551.179,4561.323,"So as we know, as Councilmember Strauss just described, this is very important work that is underway for our next major comprehensive plan.",130,,
749,0.97,4561.323,4583.078,"And in the next two years, it will be a rather large lift for us as a collective city family in order to achieve the goals as outlined in the 2024 update to is it city's comprehensive plan that will continue to drive the city's policymaking around how and where we will see growth across the city.",130,,
750,0.97,4583.078,4594.356,So these two items are directly related to that comprehensive planned body of work that will be under taken by Opcd.,130,,
751,0.97,4594.356,4602.864,Amendment Opcd 002 would provide Opcd additional term limited support to help more communities understand the work that is underway.,130,,
752,0.97,4602.864,4611.106,A recent survey by the Seattle Chamber of Commerce indicated approximately 2/3 of respondents support greater density across the city.,130,,
753,0.97,4611.106,4620.015,But we know we still have much engagement to do to help more communities and neighbors understand what the comprehensive plan really means to them.,130,,
754,0.97,4620.015,4624.252,We also know that individuals engage with the city on these issues in very different ways.,130,,
755,0.97,4624.252,4636.264,"While some folks have time to go to Stakeholder meetings or to call in for Stakeholder meetings, there are others who simply do not have the time to do that.",130,,
756,0.97,4636.264,4661.49,And so this public education strategic adviser position would be focused on making sure that we are targeting information in public education about the comprehensive plan work towards those populations who are unable to participate in the ordinary ways through the ordinary George Zimmermans that the city usually Deploys in this area.,130,,
757,0.97,4661.49,4687.849,"Since public education effort is really important to make sure that we are able to reach a more robust set of neighbors and community members as we work towards educating folks about this complex, dense set of land use policy that impacts all of us.",130,,
758,0.97,4687.849,4692.554,Amendment PPC 3003 sup pores good Governance in our environment.,130,,
759,0.97,4692.554,4702.264,My office has been hearing from many diverse Stakeholders that our land use and building codes continue to be cumbersome and cause delays in meeting housing and child care needs.,130,,
760,0.97,4702.264,4705.567,We talked about that in a previous agenda item.,130,,
761,0.97,4705.567,4712.107,This would add capacity to Opcd.,130,,
762,0.97,4712.107,4713.675,For land use rules.,130,,
763,0.97,4713.675,4725.654,"Different than our design codes to allow us to identify recommendations to streamline, update, and modernize our land use and building codes for concurrent action with our next comprehensive plan update.",130,,
764,0.97,4725.654,4726.721,Thank you Madame chair.,130,,
765,0.97,4727.389,4736.298,Thank you Council president for your description of 002 and 003.,131,,
766,0.97,4736.298,4739.501,Are there any questions or comments on these two?,131,,
767,0.97,4739.501,4742.437,"Please go ahead, Councilmember Morales.",132,,
768,0.97,4742.437,4745.34,"Thank you, I actually don't have comments.",133,,
769,0.97,4745.34,4746.441,I'm Cosponsoring both of these.,133,,
770,0.97,4746.441,4750.378,But I missed my opportunity to ask to be a cosponsor on number one.,133,,
771,0.97,4750.378,4752.18,So I'd like to do that if possible.,133,,
772,0.97,4752.914,4756.284,"No problem, Councilmember Morales.",134,,
773,0.97,4756.284,4762.224,Her name as a cosponsor to Opcd 001.,134,,

776,0.97,4770.732,4775.337,And I appreciate the specific scope that you've outlined for these two additional amendments.,134,,
777,0.97,4775.337,4783.044,I do also see a lot of similarity with 001 which I know you're a cosponsor of as well.,134,,
778,0.97,4783.044,4794.923,"And I'm wondering throughout the next week or so here if we continue to think about how these three intersect, I think what you've outlined is what should be successful outreach and engagement.",134,,
779,0.97,4794.923,4800.395,We want to make sure it targets those who are most often left out.,134,,
780,0.97,4800.395,4804.332,I look forward to learning about these items and how they intersect.,134,,
781,0.97,4804.332,4812.274,And I appreciate all the attention on the need for authentic community engagement and the actual staffing to go with it.,134,,
782,0.97,4812.274,4815.71,Any additional comments on these two?,134,,
783,0.97,4815.71,4815.911,Okay.,134,,

815,0.97,4948.109,4961.756,So stone Avenue North is located adjacent to Aurora and is also close to both the Helcion and Bella vein noble health park.,138,,
816,0.97,4961.756,4966.628,With Councilmember Sawant's help we've been working on this since winter of 2018.,138,,
817,0.97,4966.628,4990.251,"The folks have expressed their interest, as well as neighbors in transforming the plot of land currently owned by Spu and s DOT into an Amenity of the surrounding community such as a park, playground, bike trail or pedestrian walking trail we want to continue our efforts to beautify, protect, manufactured mobile home parks within our city.",138,,
818,0.97,4990.251,4997.425,Sdot was a warred $1.5 million the grant from Wsdot's pedestrian and bike program in 2021.,138,,
819,0.97,4997.425,5003.565,To complete the Aurora Avenue North planning and design study for the corridor.,138,,
820,0.97,5003.565,5005.266,Between Roy Street and North 145Th.,138,,
821,0.97,5005.266,5010.972,So that's a pretty long stretch there.,138,,
822,0.97,5010.972,5016.411,"This funding supplements 500,000 in local match for a total project budget of 2 million.",138,,
823,0.97,5016.411,5019.047,And the study will be finished in 2023.,138,,
824,0.97,5019.047,5026.921,As I'm sure Councilmember--Uhm--I forgot--I was going to say Lewis.,138,,
825,0.97,5026.921,5030.024,But I was thinking Dan.,138,,
826,0.97,5030.024,5032.427,[Laughter]--Dan Lewis is a person.,138,,
827,0.97,5032.427,5037.532,[Laughter] this is what happens when you become an Elder.,138,,
828,0.97,5037.532,5037.932,Any way.,138,,
829,0.97,5037.932,5040.268,You all know what's going on in Aurora.,138,,
830,0.97,5040.268,5042.27,It's been going on a long time.,138,,
831,0.97,5042.27,5043.972,We finally got money from the state.,138,,
832,0.97,5043.972,5046.074,"If the city, the study will get done.",138,,
833,0.97,5046.074,5048.176,We have all these improvements.,138,,
834,0.97,5048.176,5050.412,And we got the rapid right on there.,138,,
835,0.97,5050.412,5056.484,And we're trying to get people down Aurora.,138,,
836,0.97,5056.484,5061.156,In other modes Besides cars.,138,,
837,0.97,5061.156,5072.867,So this sly asks to incorporate this plot of land into the study of Aurora to identify potential public uses of this land that could activate the space and provide an Amenity for nearby residents.,138,,
838,0.97,5072.867,5080.508,Our office received assurances from Opcd that this would be a welcome addition to their work.,138,,
839,0.97,5080.508,5086.047,I don't--who are the two Councilmembers that supported me on this one?,138,,
840,0.97,5086.047,5090.618,You have Councilmember Pedersen and Councilmember Strauss.,139,,
841,0.97,5090.618,5092.62,"So Councilmember Strauss, sorry I forgot your name.",140,,
842,0.97,5092.62,5093.755,I wanted to thank you.,140,,
843,0.97,5093.755,5095.723,We've been working on this Aurora project.,140,,
844,0.97,5095.723,5098.493,And it's just been going on for so long.,140,,
845,0.97,5098.493,5101.463,"So any way, that's what we're doing folks, so thank you.",140,,
846,0.97,5101.463,5107.235,"Thank you Councilmember, Juarez.",141,,
847,0.97,5107.235,5111.773,Work you have been putting in to this year over year.,141,,
848,0.97,5111.773,5114.576,Are there any additional comments or questions?,141,,
849,0.97,5114.576,5114.809,Okay.,141,,
850,0.97,5114.809,5123.151,"Seeing none, let's move on to Opcd 006.",141,,
851,0.97,5123.151,5131.459,"Opcd 6a 1 would add $380,000 of General fund to Opcd for a Sustainability project.",141,,
852,0.97,5131.459,5139.2,"The sponsor is Councilmember Morales, Councilmembers Herbold and Sawant are cosponsors.",141,,
853,0.97,5139.2,5149.577,The proposed budget includes FTE and Opcd to support the Dawamish Valley program and this amendment would be managed by that new staff person.,141,,
854,0.97,5149.577,5152.213,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Morales.",142,,
855,0.97,5152.747,5157.452,Thank you.,143,,
856,0.97,5157.452,5157.685,Thanks.,143,,
857,0.97,5157.685,5166.561,"As Lish said, this would support indigenous led projects that were not included in the plan.",143,,
858,0.97,5166.561,5174.035,To help meet the environmental justice and equitable development goals for the Dawamish valley.,143,,
859,0.97,5174.035,5180.241,Goals that are part of the city's equitable environment agenda.,143,,
860,0.97,5180.241,5192.654,Some examples include supporting rooftop solar installation water filtration systems to support those in the industrialized river valley to access clean water.,143,,
861,0.97,5192.654,5210.371,And as Lish mentioned the funding could be supported in part by the new Dawamish Valley coordinator position.,143,,
862,0.97,5210.371,5214.442,I do have a question.,143,,
863,0.97,5214.442,5225.453,The Council budget amendment document says the long House project was not included in the Dawamish Valley action plan but it would serve the same goals.,143,,
864,0.97,5225.453,5233.394,Do you know any more history about why the long house wasn't included to begin with?,143,,
865,0.97,5233.394,5237.899,And if that's a question for central staff.,143,,
866,0.97,5237.899,5241.135,I think it's timing.,144,,
867,0.97,5241.135,5245.873,The Dawamish Valley action plan was published in I think 2018.,144,,
868,0.97,5245.873,5247.609,So we're three years later.,144,,
869,0.97,5247.609,5251.145,And new ideas have arisen.,144,,
870,0.97,5251.746,5253.348,Thank you very much.,145,,
871,0.97,5254.248,5257.719,Okay I'm not seeing any additional questions on that.,145,,
872,0.97,5257.719,5261.256,"Councilmember, thank you, let's move on to the next one.",145,,
873,0.97,5261.256,5261.856,Opcd number seven.,145,,
874,0.97,5264.559,5269.497,Opcd 7A 1 adds $11 million of General Fund.,145,,
875,0.97,5269.497,5271.466,One FTE strategic adviser.,145,,
876,0.97,5271.466,5274.435,One FTE planning and development specialist.,145,,
877,0.97,5274.435,5285.279,Senior position to Opcd for the equitable development initiative sponsored by Councilmember Morales with Councilmembers Herbold and Council President Gonzales as cosponsors.,145,,
878,0.97,5285.279,5293.421,The effect of this amendment would be to provide a total of $30 million for equitable development grants in 2022.,145,,
879,0.97,5293.421,5295.623,With all staff paid for through the general fund.,145,,
880,0.97,5295.623,5298.459,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,146,,
881,0.97,5298.459,5298.86,Please go ahead.,146,,
882,0.97,5298.86,5303.865,Thank you.,147,,
883,0.97,5303.865,5304.065,Lish.,147,,
884,0.97,5304.065,5307.402,"So Edi, I love me some Edi.",147,,
885,0.97,5307.402,5319.08,Has been prove to be a powerful tool for the city to invest in community driven development strategies that reduce racial disparities.,147,,
886,0.97,5319.08,5326.421,Last year the Edi team managed to get $10 million out the door to 21 organizations for different projects in the city.,147,,
887,0.97,5326.421,5334.262,But they received applications that totaled $50 million.,147,,
888,0.97,5334.262,5343.838,This would expand Edi to 30 million to allow the program to have more success on the city's Anti-Displacement strategies.,147,,
889,0.97,5343.838,5347.709,Responding to new economic opportunities.,147,,
890,0.97,5347.709,5357.618,Improving educational outcomes and other forms of community development in neighborhoods that have historically been targeted by systemic and institutional racism.,147,,
891,0.97,5357.618,5366.894,"And as Lish mentioned, it also adds--this amendment would add two Ftes to the team to support the growing work of that division.",147,,
892,0.97,5366.894,5372.834,We know they have a new equitable development advisory board.,147,,
893,0.97,5372.834,5375.47,And have huge demand for the work that they're doing.,147,,
894,0.97,5375.47,5378.84,So this helps expand their capacity.,147,,
895,0.97,5378.84,5380.641,"Thank you, Council President Gonzales.",148,,
896,0.97,5380.641,5381.576,Please go ahead.,148,,
897,0.97,5381.576,5385.346,"Well, I'm a cosponsor on this one.",149,,
898,0.97,5385.346,5394.055,But I actually missed my opportunity to request to be added as a sponsor to Opcd 006.,149,,
899,0.97,5394.055,5396.991,And I'd like to request for that to occur.,149,,
900,0.97,5396.991,5397.625,Sorry about that.,149,,
901,0.97,5397.625,5400.328,Thank you Council President Gonzales.,150,,
902,0.97,5400.328,5404.932,Council President Gonzales adding her name to Opcd 006.,150,,
903,0.97,5404.932,5406.534,"Councilmember Sawant, please go ahead.",150,,
904,0.97,5406.534,5412.94,I'd like to be added as a cosponsor to Opcd 007 thank you.,151,,
905,0.97,5412.94,5415.643,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,152,,
906,0.97,5415.643,5422.95,Councilmember Sawant adding her name to Opcd 007.,152,,
907,0.97,5422.95,5438.533,Councilmember Morales or also for central staff a question on Opcd 007 related to equitable development initiative investments.,152,,
908,0.97,5438.533,5451.112,I'm just curious about the overlap or maybe the connection to all of the work that we want to do with investments from jump start specific to--specific to equitable development initiative.,152,,
909,0.97,5451.112,5463.658,Can you talk a little more about how this would duck tail or what the intersect is there with the upcoming investments that we would then be making in equitable development initiative.,152,,
910,0.97,5463.658,5469.864,"I believe, especially assuming if we're able to get the first amendment we asks discussed as part of Foundational changes to our budget.",152,,
911,0.97,5471.165,5477.738,"Yeah, this is--well this would be added to the 14 million to get us to 30 million.",153,,
912,0.97,5477.738,5483.978,"And as I said, it's really a question after being able to expand the capacity of the staff there.",153,,
913,0.97,5483.978,5522.617,"As well as be able to make additional investments because we have so many projects where folks are, you know, missing the access to capital that they need right now to make a project pencil or to be able to preserve access to community space to small business space, you know, any of the number of things that we hear from our constituents that ground floor construction is really kind of the missing piece, the financing for that.",153,,
914,0.97,5522.617,5527.488,And so this is really just an effort to expand the capacity of the neighborhood Oranizations.,153,,
915,0.97,5527.488,5533.461,The community based organizations that are doing these sorts of development projects to get the capital for the ground floor construction.,153,,
916,0.97,5533.461,5541.569,Or to get the Predevelopment funds or the capacity building funds that they need to get their project to that level.,153,,
917,0.97,5541.569,5544.338,To that place where it's ready for financing.,153,,
918,0.97,5545.039,5545.239,.,153,,
919,0.97,5545.239,5549.343,"Thank you for that, Allie, did you have anything you were hoping to add?",154,,
920,0.97,5549.343,5565.66,"I was just going to note that if general fund revenues rebound in future years, the total size of the investment from jump start and equitable development initiative would be in the range of 22 million.",155,,
921,0.97,5565.66,5578.406,"So this is a little--if you add this to what's allocated in the proposed budget, this would be more like a jump start on those victims for--investments for lack of a better word.",155,,
922,0.97,5578.406,5585.947,But this would be pushing it toward the ultimate goal assuming our economy recovers and general fund revenues come back.,155,,
923,0.97,5585.947,5590.952,Thank you very much for that reminder.,156,,
924,0.97,5590.952,5592.52,"Councilmember Morales, thank you very much.",156,,
925,0.97,5592.52,5598.96,I'm not seeing additional comments.,156,,
926,0.97,5598.96,5600.428,Sdci 008.,156,,
927,0.97,5600.428,5600.928,Yeah.,157,,
928,0.97,5600.928,5606.0,So this is the final Opcd item.,157,,
929,0.97,5606.0,5612.673,Opcd 8A1 would add $2 million of General fund for North Seattle college long House project.,157,,
930,0.97,5612.673,5619.413,It's a partnership between the two Seattle clubs.,157,,
931,0.97,5619.413,5620.781,North Seattle college.,157,,
932,0.97,5620.781,5625.753,"And the project has received $750,000 through the Edi program.",157,,
933,0.97,5625.753,5628.789,This would bring them closer to their total goals.,157,,
934,0.97,5630.725,5635.329,Councilmember Juarez is a sponsor with Councilmember Sawant and Lewis as cosponsors.,157,,
935,0.97,5635.329,5638.766,Thank you very much.,158,,
936,0.97,5638.766,5639.233,Councilmember Juarez.,158,,
937,0.97,5639.233,5644.538,Thank you Councilmember Sawant and Lewis for being cosponsors.,159,,
938,0.97,5644.538,5650.111,"As Lish shared the Seattle Club and bellwether housing, we've been working on this project for a year.",159,,
939,0.97,5650.111,5667.962,"We've formed a partnership the develop 200 units of low income affordable housing in a long house on the North Seattle college campus serving as a center of cultural educational and employment activities for the residents, North Seattle college students and the broader native American community.",159,,
940,0.97,5667.962,5670.998,Not just in the South but also in the North.,159,,
941,0.97,5670.998,5676.437,It would be located adjacent to the 200 units of affordable housing.,159,,
942,0.97,5676.437,5687.415,And within walking distance of the new North gate light rail station and employment opportunities at North gate and the new Kraken community ice Plex.,159,,
943,0.97,5687.415,5696.257,Building the long house is going to enhance and continue our March towards building an indigenous Footprint in North Seattle.,159,,
944,0.97,5696.257,5705.332,"As Lish shared the equitable development initiative allocated 700,000 toward the project in its 2021 funding cycle.",159,,
945,0.97,5705.332,5708.803,These funds would increase the support to a total of 2.7.,159,,
946,0.97,5708.803,5711.539,I want to add a couple side notes.,159,,
947,0.97,5711.539,5715.976,And I think Councilmember Morales touched on this as well.,159,,
948,0.97,5715.976,5721.148,"The issue of the long house, I think it's one thing when we do these land acknowledgments.",159,,
949,0.97,5721.148,5724.085,"But for me, this is really where the rubber hits the road.",159,,
950,0.97,5724.085,5725.519,When you actually do something.,159,,
951,0.97,5725.519,5727.888,Long houses are different than community centers.,159,,
952,0.97,5727.888,5730.691,They started with Evergreen State college.,159,,
953,0.97,5730.691,5734.428,University of Washington has a long house.,159,,
954,0.97,5734.428,5735.529,The Dawamish long house.,159,,
955,0.97,5735.529,5749.143,A big thank you to our former director Sam Sopa who I met with many times in the Opcd planning working towards and using indigenous architectural and land use planning models to activate areas.,159,,
956,0.97,5749.143,5756.717,Provide common cultural space and a Footprint that honors and acknowledges the people of the indigenous people who were here.,159,,
957,0.97,5756.717,5759.587,And a long house is different than a community center.,159,,
958,0.97,5759.587,5771.565,"It isn't just a place for gathering but it's a house and a place for building community and for teaching, for healing.",159,,
959,0.97,5771.565,5778.939,And it's that cultural component that goes beyond what I can probably not really actually Express.,159,,
960,0.97,5778.939,5781.475,"But, it can't be a part of another physical building.",159,,
961,0.97,5781.475,5784.612,"Because on its own terms, it would be a separate building.",159,,
962,0.97,5784.612,5785.813,For a long house.,159,,
963,0.97,5785.813,5792.086,So it's more than an Amenity to those 200 units that we're hoping to build on the campus.,159,,
964,0.97,5792.086,5823.751,"And more than an Amenity to the other 244 units that we hope to build across the bridge when the Mayor worked with myself in Seattle housing authority to buy the eight acres, the low income housing there, to double the capacity and then the people living there can come back so the bottom floor would be for hopefully, and I'll talk about this later, the indigenous Footprint, hopefully a performing art center, child care.",159,,
965,0.97,5823.751,5830.391,And then dedicate a third to low income affordable housing and the other 3/4 to market rates.,159,,
966,0.97,5830.391,5841.836,So we're trying to have this Petri dish.,159,,
967,0.97,5841.836,5846.106,"More importantly, for me, to have that indigenous Footprint front and center that's visible.",159,,
968,0.97,5846.106,5862.89,"So when you come on the North Seattle campus, when you come up in the North end, you can actually say, there is an indigenous presence here in brick and mortar and community and language and to me, that is, hopefully one of my legacies, so thank you.",159,,
969,0.97,5862.89,5866.727,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",160,,
970,0.97,5868.963,5870.831,It's Juarez.,161,,
971,0.97,5870.831,5871.398,,162,,
972,0.97,5871.398,5875.469,I'm paying things back for Councilmember Strauss there.,163,,
973,0.97,5875.469,5878.839,[Laughter]. Yeah.,163,,
974,0.97,5878.839,5883.077,How's that for cover?,163,,
975,0.97,5883.077,5885.179,I'm probably 20 years older than her.,164,,

989,0.97,5922.616,5929.957,"So before we'll read that into the record, just confirming Lish, anything else from you on this?",168,,
990,0.97,5929.957,5930.19,No.,169,,
991,0.97,5930.19,5930.424,Thanks.,169,,
992,0.97,5930.424,5932.593,Thanks for your time today.,170,,

996,0.97,5937.498,5946.774,Thank you for all the conversation and also your work to exercise restraint in our longevity.,170,,
997,0.97,5946.774,5948.909,In some of these conversations today.,170,,
998,0.97,5948.909,5953.514,We're getting the gist of what you're proposing and there's been some good dialogue.,170,,
999,0.97,5953.514,5955.582,So thanks for the questions and the back and forth.,170,,
1000,0.97,5955.582,5958.452,Let's move on to Department of neighborhoods.,170,,

1005,0.97,5965.192,5967.728,Thank you very much.,172,,
1006,0.97,5967.728,5972.099,Let's go ahead with 001.,172,,
1007,0.97,5972.099,5981.809,Department of neighborhoods 1A 1 would add a million dollars of General fund to support planning for the China town International district.,173,,
1008,0.97,5981.809,5989.116,Sponsor is Councilmember Morales with Strauss and president Gonzales as cosponsors.,173,,
1009,0.97,5989.116,5990.217,Thank you very much.,174,,
1010,0.97,5990.217,5995.255,"I appreciate the work Councilmember Morales, please go ahead.",174,,
1011,0.97,5995.255,6000.361,"Colleagues, I think I need to give just a little bit of background for context here.",175,,
1012,0.97,6000.361,6011.972,"For a year or two now, a group calling itself the China town International development vision group has been meeting.",175,,
1013,0.97,6011.972,6016.076,"It includes Skipta, interim, the Winglick museum.",175,,
1014,0.97,6016.076,6017.277,"The CIA, Bia.",175,,
1015,0.97,6017.277,6023.684,And several other groups who as you may know don't always agree on how things should go down in the Cid.,175,,
1016,0.97,6023.684,6043.303,But they have been working together with a neutral third party who is actually the Denise Louis child care center serving as a neutral fiscal agent for them as they work through together on how to develop a frame work for what kind of planning should happen in the Cid.,175,,
1017,0.97,6043.303,6046.84,How they're going to make decisions.,175,,
1018,0.97,6046.84,6056.083,And work together especially given that there are so many different planning processes underway or about to be underway in the neighborhood.,175,,
1019,0.97,6056.083,6058.485,"Maritime industrial land, the sound transit station.",175,,
1020,0.97,6058.485,6060.821,There's a lot going on.,175,,
1021,0.97,6060.821,6064.491,"So all that to say, they've been working together.",175,,
1022,0.97,6064.491,6081.708,They have developed a frame work for decision making and community building to develop a full fledged neighborhood plan that they want to present to Opcd for incorporation--inclusion in the city's neighborhood planning.,175,,
1023,0.97,6081.708,6087.614,So they've been meeting but they want to complete this work over the next 18 months.,175,,
1024,0.97,6087.614,6093.053,And so they're asking for funding to complete the plan.,175,,
1025,0.97,6093.053,6106.333,The idea is for don to contract with a consultant or consultants to get community input over seven issue areas that this group has identified.,175,,
1026,0.97,6106.333,6121.248,"For example, business and economic strength, housing, human services, transportation, the funding itself would cover consultant expenses like coordinating meetings, meeting with each of these area leads.",175,,
1027,0.97,6121.248,6126.019,"Data collection, training the staff on decision making.",175,,
1028,0.97,6126.019,6127.387,"Writing, editing, et cetera.",175,,
1029,0.97,6127.387,6134.595,It would also cover direct expenses for all of the community meetings that you can imagine would be involved in something like this.,175,,
1030,0.97,6134.595,6147.474,"And those expenses would include translation support for focus groups, child care, food, advertising, meeting supplies, et cetera.",175,,
1031,0.97,6147.474,6156.183,So that is the--I should say that the idea is to fund this over 15 or 18 months.,175,,
1032,0.97,6156.183,6162.422,"And so the ask would be for 800,000 in 2022 and 200,000 for the next year.",175,,
1033,0.97,6162.422,6169.93,"So as we're having this conversation, we can just keep that in mind, that, you know, we can split this up a little bit.",175,,
1034,0.97,6169.93,6174.935,And still meet the needs that the community's asking for.,175,,
1035,0.97,6175.335,6183.31,"Thank you for flagging that Councilmember Morales, are there any additional comments or questions on this item?",175,,
1036,0.97,6184.478,6184.945,Okay.,175,,
1037,0.97,6185.312,6186.313,Thank you very much.,175,,
1038,0.97,6186.313,6187.147,Let's move on to 002.,175,,
1039,0.97,6187.147,6189.283,Department of neighborhoods.,175,,
1040,0.97,6191.785,6200.093,Don 2A1 would request the Department of neighborhoods provide recommendations on opportunities for a more equitable economy and community wealth building.,175,,
1041,0.97,6200.093,6204.164,This is a statement of legislative intent.,175,,
1042,0.97,6204.164,6211.004,The sponsor is Councilmember Morales with Councilmember Strauss and Council President Gonzales as cosponsors.,175,,
1043,0.97,6214.408,6217.411,"Wonderful, welcome back.",176,,
1044,0.97,6217.411,6220.514,Karina.,176,,
1045,0.97,6227.12,6229.856,I'm realizing I'm getting tired.,176,,
1046,0.97,6229.856,6231.291,I probably need coffee.,176,,
1047,0.97,6231.291,6233.093,Welcome back Councilmember Morales.,176,,
1048,0.97,6233.093,6235.229,Thank you.,177,,
1049,0.97,6235.229,6246.607,"So the proposed 2022 budget includes I think it's about $600,000 to don for education around community wealth building.",177,,
1050,0.97,6246.607,6262.522,And so this statement of legislative intent really just requests that the Department use some of that funding to coordinate with other departments on the various community wealth building efforts that we have in the city.,177,,
1051,0.97,6262.522,6272.532,And the idea would be here to direct don to work with a consultant or an expert in inclusive economies and inclusive growth.,177,,
1052,0.97,6272.532,6294.655,And also in cross sector strategic planning to really look at how the city--how the programs we have all ready can best support strategies that reduce the racial wealth gap and that increase generational wealth.,177,,
1053,0.97,6294.655,6299.893,To use funding to get an outside expert to coordinate and assess the work the city is doing all ready.,177,,
1054,0.97,6300.961,6302.696,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,177,,
1055,0.97,6302.696,6311.071,So there's all ready a number of wealth building projects and programs in our city departments.,177,,
1056,0.97,6311.071,6321.014,You're interested in coordinating that through one single entity and having greater cohesion across departments so we have a blueprint for how we make this?,177,,
1057,0.97,6321.014,6325.152,Thank you for that clarification.,177,,
1058,0.97,6325.152,6326.153,Additional comments or questions?,177,,
1059,0.97,6326.153,6326.453,All right.,177,,
1060,0.97,6326.453,6330.223,Let's move on to don 003.,177,,
1061,0.97,6333.226,6335.829,Karina with central staff.,178,,
1062,0.97,6335.829,6350.877,"Don 3A 1 at this Council budget action would proviso 750,000 general fund in Department of neighborhoods to develop a guaranteed basic income program with a goal of implementing the program in 2022.",178,,
1063,0.97,6350.877,6355.015,The budget amendment is sponsored by Council President Gonzales.,178,,
1064,0.97,6355.015,6359.586,And is also sponsored by Councilmembers Morales and Strauss.,178,,
1065,0.97,6359.586,6361.088,Thank you very much.,179,,
1066,0.97,6361.088,6362.589,"Council President, please go ahead.",179,,
1067,0.97,6363.757,6370.797,"Well, maybe I can offer you, chair Mosqueda, a dose of energy through this zoom screen.",180,,
1068,0.97,6370.797,6384.678,"I am really excited about don 003, which would provide us the first steps in being able to develop and implement a guaranteed basic income program at the city of Seattle.",180,,
1069,0.97,6384.678,6392.386,"You know, I was really inspired by what we have been seeing the Biden administration do.",180,,
1070,0.97,6392.386,6393.82,Specifically through the child tax credit.,180,,
1071,0.97,6393.82,6398.258,Which is a form of a basic income program.,180,,
1072,0.97,6398.258,6411.738,And some of the early research findings by the Brookings Institute shows that monthly income programs like these can really make a huge difference in decreasing things like child poverty.,180,,
1073,0.97,6411.738,6416.61,And can also be a tool for increasing family social mobility in the long-term.,180,,
1074,0.97,6418.178,6456.249,"And so we have an opportunity to hear at the city of Seattle where we have also utilized our one-time Federal dollars by implementing direct cash assistance programs, we have an opportunity to identify ways that we can continue that--those kinds of investments that will work towards creating greater financial stability for those who need it the most and combat deep seeded systemic issues like poverty that impact many within our communities.",180,,
1075,0.97,6456.249,6471.965,So I am excited to have an opportunity to advance this particular effort so that we can look at the long-term planning that will be needed to implement a basic income program moving forward.,180,,
1076,0.97,6471.965,6502.262,"Again, building on our all ready proven success I think through our direct cash assistance programs included in the Seattle rescue plan and also what we are seeing as success stories through Biden's child tax credit program and also what we are seeing as success to the South of us with our neighbors in San Francisco who have implemented a guaranteed basic income program specifically for individuals who are Unhoused at about I think $500 a month.",180,,
1077,0.97,6502.262,6514.975,And that program is all ready showing much promise in terms of creating economic stability within the Unhoused population and creating an additional opportunity for those individuals to stabilize.,180,,
1078,0.97,6514.975,6518.745,So I am really excited about this opportunity.,180,,
1079,0.97,6518.745,6525.418,And I hope to be able to earn your support and appreciate the support of my cosponsors.,180,,
1080,0.97,6525.418,6531.591,"Thank you very much, Council President, thank you for the energy and enthusiasm for this amendment.",181,,
1081,0.97,6531.591,6535.362,And I'm not seeing any additional questions.,181,,
1082,0.97,6535.362,6536.463,Thanks for the motivation.,181,,
1083,0.97,6536.463,6540.634,I'm going to go ahead and add my name as a cosponsor to this item.,181,,
1084,0.97,6540.634,6543.97,And we're going to plow through to the next one.,181,,
1085,0.97,6543.97,6547.307,Please go ahead.,181,,
1086,0.97,6552.312,6552.479,Hi.,181,,

1088,0.97,6554.147,6560.253,"Or excuse M, we are all done with that section, thank you Karina is that all?",181,,
1089,0.97,6560.253,6565.825,"That's all from the office of Sustainability, yes.",182,,
1090,0.97,6565.825,6566.192,Wonderful.,183,,
1091,0.97,6566.192,6569.963,"Councilmember Mosqueda, I'm adding myself to don 003.",183,,

1093,0.97,6578.638,6582.876,"Item 17, office of Sustainability and environment for briefing and discussion.",184,,
1094,0.97,6582.876,6593.386,"Now we can say hello Yolanda, thank you for being here, let's get started with Osc 001.",185,,
1095,0.97,6593.386,6610.57,"Osc 1A 1 sponsored by Council President Gonzales and cosponsored by Councilmembers Juarez and Morales, this would add $100,000 of General fund one time to the office of Sustainability and environment to support development of a plan to establish resilience hubs throughout Seattle.",186,,
1096,0.97,6610.57,6616.71,The hubs are designed to provide air conditioning and clean air during extreme heat and Wildfire smoke events.,186,,
1097,0.97,6617.277,6619.245,Thank you very much.,187,,
1098,0.97,6619.245,6620.08,Go ahead Council President.,187,,

1101,0.97,6626.786,6636.262,We can begin advancing meaningful change for building community climate resilience through adoption of this particular amendment.,188,,
1102,0.97,6636.262,6649.009,This is an item that is Prioritized in the solidarity budget that we've been hearing about and I am really honored to have an opportunity to sponsor this on behalf of community.,188,,
1103,0.97,6649.009,6657.25,We are as Yolanda mentioned in her remarks seeing the impact of climate charged weather via extreme heat or Wildfire smoke.,188,,
1104,0.97,6657.25,6670.897,And so this funding supports outreach to conduct a vulnerability assessment to better understand the needs of vulnerable individuals to get to a cooling center or smoke shelter when these extreme weather incidents occur.,188,,
1105,0.97,6670.897,6686.846,The second part of this item would conduct a survey of Existingcity facilities that could be activated so that no resident any where in the city would be more than 15 minutes away from an extreme weather shelter.,188,,
1106,0.97,6686.846,6690.283,And it would also assess what energy needs these facilities have.,188,,
1107,0.97,6690.283,6698.158,And if there are opportunities for the city of Seattle to retrofit those publicly owned facilities for green energy infrastructure.,188,,
1108,0.97,6698.158,6700.493,Thank you Madame chair.,188,,

1114,0.97,6742.669,6757.15,"So I think they are in the development of the next all hazards mitigation plan looking at doing some of this work as it relates to climate specifically around, extreme heat events.",190,,
1115,0.97,6757.15,6766.426,So just flagging that this might be something that would benefit from some collaboration with the office of emergency management.,190,,

1128,0.97,6820.446,6823.216,The proviso itself is one time.,194,,
1129,0.97,6823.216,6845.371,As funding for program transfers from human services Department to Osc the human services department previously had funded the Dawamish Valley youth core for a number of you'll I gauge . programs focused on environmental justice and job skills.,194,,
1130,0.97,6845.371,6847.807,It's been in operation since 2014.,194,,
1131,0.97,6847.807,6852.478,Again the funding has historically been through Hsd.,194,,
1132,0.97,6852.478,6857.217,That was from back--dating back to 2018.,194,,
1133,0.97,6857.217,6861.988,This proviso is to ensure that the youth core continues to be funded by the city.,194,,
1134,0.97,6861.988,6882.342,In this sort of larger bucket of funds that Osc proposes to focus around the programs within environmental programs within the Dawamish valley.,194,,
1135,0.97,6882.342,6885.812,There's a large number of dollars they told us they intended to spend.,194,,
1136,0.97,6885.812,6889.048,They told us they do intend to fund the youth core.,194,,
1137,0.97,6889.048,6899.125,This is just to ensure that they receive an adequate amount of funding when the executive is ready to make that decision.,194,,
1138,0.97,6899.125,6912.272,The other piece I think that's important to remember is that the Dawamish Valley is home to 1600 people of which 42% are immigrants.,194,,
1139,0.97,6912.272,6914.674,37% are Latin X. and 63% are people of color.,194,,
1140,0.97,6915.074,6918.311,Thank you.,194,,
1141,0.97,6923.583,6924.584,Thank you.,194,,
1142,0.97,6924.584,6926.386,Thank you Councilmember Herbold for your work on this.,194,,
1143,0.97,6926.386,6934.193,"I did want to ask from central staff when reviewing this, I had a question about the title here.",194,,
1144,0.97,6934.193,6951.377,"Let me make sure that I fully understood stood that when we--if we're successful in applying amendment number one from the Finance general discussion that we had this morning, and we correct the revenue sources, is this revenue source also Moveable?",194,,
1145,0.97,6951.377,6951.611,Right?,194,,
1146,0.97,6951.611,6956.382,I think that was the intent that I had understood from the sponsor that it was not.,194,,
1147,0.97,6956.382,6958.451,That this item specifically should be tied to jump start.,194,,
1148,0.97,6958.451,6962.689,But it was amending the Mayor's Poposed budget that came down.,194,,
1149,0.97,6962.689,6967.493,So perhaps a clarifying question it looks like from the sponsor here.,194,,
1150,0.97,6967.493,6972.498,Your intent is to really make sure that the funds go into this investment verses where the dollars come from.,194,,
1151,0.97,6972.498,6973.166,Is that correct?,194,,
1152,0.97,6973.166,6976.235,That is correct.,195,,
1153,0.97,6976.235,6976.669,Wonderful.,196,,
1154,0.97,6976.669,6980.773,Anything else from central staff?,196,,
1155,0.97,6980.773,6980.974,Okay.,196,,
1156,0.97,6980.974,6981.207,Great.,196,,
1157,0.97,6981.207,6985.878,"Well, we will work with you then Councilmember Herbold, just to make sure that I'm clear on that as well.",196,,
1158,0.97,6985.878,6989.382,So I wanted to make sure that was clear for the record.,196,,
1159,0.97,6989.382,6992.418,And I appreciate your work on this amendment.,196,,
1160,0.97,6992.885,6997.757,Let's go on to 003.,196,,
1161,0.97,6997.757,6998.558,Okay.,196,,
1162,0.97,6998.558,7002.161,003A 1. sponsored by Councilmember Pierson.,196,,
1163,0.97,7002.161,7004.63,Cosponsored by Councilmembers Juarez and Strauss.,196,,
1164,0.97,7004.63,7017.377,This is a statement of intent that would request that Osc and the Seattle parks and recreation develop a plan to phase out the use of all gas powered leaf Blowers in Seattle within two years.,196,,
1165,0.97,7017.377,7026.986,The response would be due to the Sustainability and Renter's rights committee or its successor committee by June 3RD 2022.,196,,
1166,0.97,7026.986,7037.096,"Well, thank you very much, and Councilmember Pedersen, with Councilmember Juarez and Strauss, I appreciate your sponsorship with us, please go ahead, Councilmember Pedersen.",197,,
1167,0.97,7037.096,7038.931,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,198,,
1168,0.97,7038.931,7052.311,I'd like to thank the dozen of constituents who have sent Emails to the city council in support of this effort to stroke gas engines or terrible noise in particular.,198,,
1169,0.97,7052.311,7059.185,Polluters and the trend across the country is to start to phase those out or ban them completely over time.,198,,
1170,0.97,7059.185,7062.755,The state of California just passed a law on this.,198,,
1171,0.97,7062.755,7072.298,"The technology for quieter, cleaner, electric powered leaf Blowers has improved a lot since previous city council considered this idea years ago.",198,,
1172,0.97,7072.298,7080.406,So this is just a statement of legislative intent to have the executive come back to us with a plan to phase them out.,198,,
1173,0.97,7080.406,7090.483,This could include a buy back or exchange program to help those who need to have those for the services they provide.,198,,
1174,0.97,7090.483,7092.118,But they would be Electric.,198,,
1175,0.97,7092.118,7109.936,They would be replacing they would have to work out a plan to phase out as well.,198,,
1176,0.97,7109.936,7111.304,"Thank you, council member Pederson.",199,,
1177,0.97,7111.304,7115.475,Any additional comments or questions on this one.,199,,
1178,0.97,7115.475,7127.353,I know there's a lot of excitement and a lot of questions moving into this one.,199,,
1179,0.97,7127.353,7132.258,But I know there's movement into lowering pollution in all senses of the word.,199,,
1180,0.97,7132.258,7135.962,Both in the air we breathe and the noise.,199,,
1181,0.97,7135.962,7147.373,I was just going to signal that I would like to not just signal but I would like to say that I would like to be added as a sponsor to ose 003.,200,,
1182,0.97,7147.373,7150.543,I do appreciate Council member Pedersen bringing this issue forward.,200,,
1183,0.97,7150.543,7176.302,I remember you know two or three years ago we were talking about the potential of doing this body of work and and I know it is important for the city to to look at how we phase out gas power and leaf Blowers across the city.,200,,
1184,0.97,7176.302,7198.257,As part and parcel of our climate action plan and to reduce our carbon emissions produced by fossil fuels it would be critical to phase out our reliance on gas powered leaf Blowers.,200,,
1185,0.97,7198.257,7205.164,So I appreciate Council member Pederson's initiative.,200,,
1186,0.97,7205.164,7210.403,"Let's move on to, we reached the end of that category.",201,,
1187,0.97,7210.403,7210.803,Okay wonderful.,201,,
1188,0.97,7210.803,7217.977,Thank you very much for your work on that.,201,,
1189,0.97,7217.977,7218.945,Second to last item folks.,201,,
1190,0.97,7218.945,7220.513,We're going to make it on time.,201,,
1191,0.97,7220.513,7222.381,Thank you for the energy you're giving me.,201,,
1192,0.97,7222.381,7228.487,We're going to make it through this.,201,,
1193,0.97,7228.487,7237.563,Office of development & GT; & GT; this is the largest list of developments to be considered.,202,,
1194,0.97,7237.563,7239.599,I believe we have one for consideration.,202,,
1195,0.97,7239.599,7246.272,"So please, please go ahead and walk us through this.",202,,
1196,0.97,7246.272,7248.808,Yolanda you are still with us.,202,,
1197,0.97,7248.808,7249.942,"Office of economic development, zero zero one.",202,,
1198,0.97,7249.942,7255.214,Do you want to switch to Oed.,203,,
1199,0.97,7255.214,7258.251,So we're all on alignment here.,203,,
1200,0.97,7258.251,7265.791,So Oed 151 sponsored by Council member Morales cosponsored Byherbold and Lewis.,203,,
1201,0.97,7265.791,7276.736,"This would add $150,000 to general fund one time to Oed for an organization that provides employment opportunities for use in the creative sector such as the Northwest folk life.",203,,
1202,0.97,7276.736,7291.651,"And we just note that the city may be funding this Organization for a total up to $150,000 next year but that is not guaranteed at this point.",203,,
1203,0.97,7291.651,7292.585,"So sorry, council member Morales.",204,,
1204,0.97,7292.585,7296.789,I just want to make sure I understand that last line that you said.,204,,
1205,0.97,7296.789,7300.826,Yolanda can you repeat what you said.,204,,
1206,0.97,7300.826,7306.999,"I will just note, it's jointly funded between the office of arts and culture and office of economic development.",205,,
1207,0.97,7306.999,7326.986,"So office of arts and culture has confirmed $50,000 from their budget will go to this organization and office of economic development is still kind of deciding they decided to fund this organization at $100,000 in 2021 and have indicated that they may fund them again next year at that same level.",205,,
1208,0.97,7326.986,7330.856,But it's you know they're still kind of in the decision making process.,205,,
1209,0.97,7330.856,7334.36,So I just wanted to flag that for Y'all.,205,,
1210,0.97,7334.36,7335.961,I apologize for the delay Council member Morales.,206,,
1211,0.97,7335.961,7338.297,I just want to make sure I understand that last line.,206,,
1212,0.97,7338.297,7349.075,How is it at this point in developing the draft budget that the defendant is still in the process of developing what the 2022 deployment looks like?,206,,
1213,0.97,7349.075,7360.252,We received the proposed budget from the Mayor's office which they have believed six to eight months that they draft together.,206,,
1214,0.97,7360.252,7367.827,So remind me how that happens.,206,,
1215,0.97,7367.827,7368.094,Well.,207,,
1216,0.97,7368.094,7369.795,If you can.,208,,
1217,0.97,7369.795,7373.132,I can go through this detailed operation.,209,,
1218,0.97,7373.132,7384.11,"And we talked specifically regarding this contract they had initially indicated they had funded them at $60,000 in 2021.",209,,
1219,0.97,7384.11,7390.683,"And recently decided to increase that amount to $100,000 in 2021.",209,,
1220,0.97,7390.683,7398.858,"So that is the information I was given and that they will funds this at $100,000.",209,,
1221,0.97,7398.858,7406.766,But you do raise a good point that there does appear to be some fluidity in what is happening currently.,209,,
1222,0.97,7406.766,7409.535,"Okay, well I appreciate you offering clarification thank you.",210,,
1223,0.97,7409.535,7418.277,We'll follow up with you on the process concerns that are raised for me at this time in the budget deliberations process.,210,,
1224,0.97,7418.277,7431.69,But let's go ahead and turn it to Council member Morales to give us a little more context into what these dollars do provide.,210,,
1225,0.97,7431.69,7432.124,Thank you.,211,,
1226,0.97,7432.124,7444.57,Well as Yolanda mentioned this would supply support for organizations like folk life.,211,,
1227,0.97,7444.57,7456.115,Kebgtdingconnecting people with paid Internships in the connective community.,211,,
1228,0.97,7456.115,7467.626,"Expose young people to media, marketing, Pec, film, music, and well it's performing arts related work.",211,,
1229,0.97,7467.626,7473.699,The same way we have worked development opportunities for youth in Maritime industrial and construction trades.,211,,
1230,0.97,7473.699,7484.41,We are looking to make sure that we continue to support the creative Industries as part of our work force development strategies.,211,,
1231,0.97,7484.41,7494.52,"So I appreciate the question chairman Mosqueda and definitely want to follow up the picture that we are, that we know how we will be funding and at what level.",211,,
1232,0.97,7494.52,7496.889,For the other departments already.,211,,
1233,0.97,7496.889,7498.524,Thank you very much Council member Morales.,212,,
1234,0.97,7498.524,7502.228,Just a quick question I think for you as the sponsor.,212,,
1235,0.97,7502.228,7516.275,"Can you talk a little bit about how this item, had any influence from or input from our friends at the arts Commission.",212,,
1236,0.97,7516.275,7528.354,"Yeah, so this is part of the work we're trying to do with the arts Commission.",213,,
1237,0.97,7528.354,7530.589,We would be back on track.,213,,
1238,0.97,7530.589,7532.591,And supporting the connections is an important part of that.,213,,
1239,0.97,7532.591,7540.866,We want to make sure we're providing this opportunity for young people as part of their work force development strategy.,213,,
1240,0.97,7540.866,7550.876,So this is part of the strategy to really sort of add back in to the work Oed is doing.,213,,
1241,0.97,7550.876,7555.781,The connections along the way in the creative industry sector.,213,,
1242,0.97,7555.781,7558.317,"Great, Okay, thank you very much.",214,,
1243,0.97,7558.317,7561.987,Any additional questions or comments on this one?,214,,
1244,0.97,7561.987,7562.187,Okay.,214,,
1245,0.97,7562.187,7564.023,And we appreciate the conversations to come.,214,,
1246,0.97,7564.023,7570.029,Thank you for the context on this.,214,,
1247,0.97,7570.029,7576.235,Let's move on to Oed zero zero two.,214,,
1248,0.97,7576.235,7579.638,Oed 0021.,215,,
1249,0.97,7579.638,7589.114,And this is sponsored by Councilmember Morales and cosponsored by Council member Pederson.,215,,
1250,0.97,7589.114,7594.253,This would create a strategic plan in collaboration with work force development partners.,215,,
1251,0.97,7594.253,7603.963,This would also impose the division director and creative industry manager positions until the plan is submitted to the Council.,215,,
1252,0.97,7603.963,7606.265,Thank you very much.,216,,
1253,0.97,7606.265,7608.567,Please go ahead Council member Morales.,216,,
1254,0.97,7608.567,7609.368,Thank you.,217,,
1255,0.97,7609.368,7626.919,So colleagues I've mentioned a few times throughout in budget process that there's many different ways in which the city is engaging in work force development.,217,,
1256,0.97,7626.919,7638.664,"And that given the different departments, I think it's Importan that we take some time to evaluate how as a city we're really engaging in this work.",217,,
1257,0.97,7638.664,7641.867,So this would allow us to do sort of assess the landscape.,217,,
1258,0.97,7641.867,7656.882,"Look at how the city is, at our current work force development investments to really understand how we can coordinate those efforts better into a Holistic strategy.",217,,
1259,0.97,7656.882,7678.837,And I will say you know supporting that strategic planning process is intended to help us work with our Renallal regional partner which is different folks have indicated there's a sense of frustration that the city isn't working with our regional partners as well as we could.,217,,
1260,0.97,7678.837,7709.435,"One example of the ways in which we are doing that is the fact that as we mentioned, as I mentioned before for the last couple of years the line of business in Oed around film and music and creative Industries a lot of that work has been done by the arts Commission by you know the folks have been working on developing the Pba for example.",217,,
1261,0.97,7709.435,7711.036,This work is all aligned.,217,,
1262,0.97,7711.036,7719.278,The fact that there's been a lot of shuffling of positions has created a lot of concern.,217,,
1263,0.97,7719.278,7726.885,"And so, until we have this strategy in place, until we have an assessment of what the best way is to move forward.",217,,
1264,0.97,7726.885,7735.494,I am requesting that we provide the two positions that are in that line of business right now.,217,,
1265,0.97,7735.494,7743.969,"And then, when the next director is hired in the Department you know, there will be an opportunity for that director to make a decision about how to move forward with those positions.",217,,
1266,0.97,7743.969,7751.376,And with the work that has been done in the last couple of years.,217,,
1267,0.97,7751.376,7755.247,Around work force development in the Department.,217,,
1268,0.97,7755.247,7755.881,"That's all, thank you.",218,,
1269,0.97,7755.881,7766.558,This definitely echoes some of the things we've been hearing as well from our friends in labor about needing to have more alignment about the work that we do and the state's work force development Council.,218,,
1270,0.97,7766.558,7768.56,Our work force development Council so thank you.,218,,
1271,0.97,7768.56,7769.595,Council member Herbold please go ahead.,219,,
1272,0.97,7769.595,7773.999,I would just like to add my name as a sponsor.,220,,
1273,0.97,7773.999,7774.766,Thank you.,220,,
1274,0.97,7774.766,7776.335,"Wonderful, thank you.",221,,
1275,0.97,7776.335,7778.237,Council member Herbold.,221,,
1276,0.97,7778.237,7780.639,Council member Herbold adding her name to Oed 002.,221,,
1277,0.97,7780.639,7781.273,Thank you very much.,221,,
1278,0.97,7785.277,7786.478,Let's move on.,221,,
1279,0.97,7786.478,7804.129,Okay Oed 3 a 1. sponsored by Council member Lewis cosponsored by Juarez and Sawant.,222,,
1280,0.97,7804.129,7822.147,These efforts would be led by an organization that attracts Lee leisure like visit Seattle.,222,,
1281,0.97,7822.147,7825.35,"Thank you very much Council member Lewis, go ahead.",223,,
1282,0.97,7825.35,7830.689,Thank you very much more for giving us an opportunity to jump on this priority.,224,,
1283,0.97,7830.689,7846.939,So we're about to have a big new convention center here in the city of Seattle and a big component of that is making sure we get the word out to attract big conventions to come and take advantage of this new Amenity in the city.,224,,
1284,0.97,7846.939,7866.725,The visit Seattle Bia I'm not sure how familiar members of the public are but visit Seattle is a type of business improvement area which can only use the money they collect on travel.,224,,
1285,0.97,7866.725,7889.982,There's a loophole where they're not able to use the money that is taken from hotel revenue to attract Conventioneers which is a different type of event.,224,,
1286,0.97,7889.982,7911.103,"But in the meantime, we are going to be in a position where the time line for attracting conventions is going to be getting more real and there will be a need for some potential resource to come in and augment those efforts.",224,,
1287,0.97,7911.103,7924.65,So this is an opportunity here as a Council to make a big investment up front to make sure the city and region are recovering by filling the new convention center.,224,,
1288,0.97,7924.65,7933.825,Conventions as all of us know have a major impact on the vitality of the city from attracting a large number of people into the city for the convention.,224,,
1289,0.97,7933.825,7939.064,"Who in turn are eating out, are going to restaurants are going out to bars.",224,,
1290,0.97,7939.064,7945.57,Are you know using cabs and ride shares and just generally spending a lot of money in our city.,224,,
1291,0.97,7945.57,7966.525,So this is a way to make sure that we have a steady pipeline of attracting people to visit and to make sure that we are using making the best use of our great new massive convention center that will be opening downtown in the near future.,224,,
1292,0.97,7966.525,7967.993,Thank you very much Council member Lewis.,224,,
1293,0.97,7967.993,7984.109,Thanks for flagging this issue and I look forward as you noted looking at some of the longer term ways we can create longer stability for the investments in the ways we attract folks to come into our new convention center.,224,,
1294,0.97,7984.109,7987.546,Council President Gonzalez I will turn to you and then I have one question.,224,,
1295,0.97,7987.546,7999.057,I appreciate hearing a little bit more detail about this item.,225,,
1296,0.97,7999.057,8003.862,Thank you Council member Lewis for bringing this forward.,225,,
1297,0.97,8003.862,8023.815,"I'm mindful of the fact that this convention center, the expansion of which is, is receiving public funds is you know this project is really important to the vitality of downtown.",225,,
1298,0.97,8023.815,8026.918,In sort of a broad sense.,225,,
1299,0.97,8026.918,8071.396,"But I also want to acknowledge that the number of jobs especially a healthy amount of conventions coming to the city of Seattle and I can tell from visit Seattle's Website that there's already an up tick in the number of conventions starting to come to Seattle and if there are things that we can do to bolster and support that, I would certainly be interested in any short term investments that are needed in order to sort of give the convention that gives us an opportunity to get off on the right foot.",225,,
1300,0.97,8071.396,8079.137,This is a good economic opportunity and also a good opportunity to get many of our hospitality workers back to work.,225,,
1301,0.97,8079.137,8091.049,"If there are more conventions, there's going to be more work and more opportunity for people to go back to work in a safe manner.",225,,
1302,0.97,8091.049,8097.422,I see this a Win-Win opportunity for both the worker side and the convention side of the equation.,225,,
1303,0.97,8097.422,8110.936,And would like to go ahead and add my name to Oed 003.,225,,
1304,0.97,8110.936,8112.871,Thank you Council member.,226,,
1305,0.97,8112.871,8117.843,Adding her name to Oed 003.,226,,
1306,0.97,8117.843,8129.321,One of the things I'm reminded about when we talk about this need in the community.,226,,
1307,0.97,8129.321,8135.66,Including folks that are workers when we thought about the impact that Covid would have during the pandemic.,226,,
1308,0.97,8135.66,8140.665,We cut jump start and including was funding for resilience.,226,,
1309,0.97,8140.665,8144.703,Which we wrote from input with folks who were thinking about this.,226,,
1310,0.97,8144.703,8151.276,How can we recruit more conventions and conferences and worker training opportunities.,226,,
1311,0.97,8151.276,8152.41,And Incubator discussions for our next entrepreneurs.,226,,
1312,0.97,8152.41,8166.491,How can we recruit them to come to Seattle and enjoy our city and also be part of the economic engine as we seek to build our way out of this recession.,226,,
1313,0.97,8166.491,8168.66,So Ali I see you on the screen.,226,,
1314,0.97,8168.66,8174.566,I'm hoping you can remind me what the language was from jump start resilient session.,226,,
1315,0.97,8174.566,8186.478,Because we had anticipated we wrote into law that the Mayor's office was supposed to send us an implementation plan and a road map for utilizing the economic resilience component of jump start funds.,226,,
1316,0.97,8186.478,8198.723,That report was not guilty submitted by July as we now anticipated but I think there's a lot of overlap and some of the items the Council has noted today.,226,,
1317,0.97,8198.723,8203.995,Some of the items we've seen on the proposed budget.,226,,
1318,0.97,8203.995,8215.24,And some of the items that can be in this investment.,226,,
1319,0.97,8215.24,8226.117,It calls for 15% of the proceeds to be used to support local business and tourism to spur the local economic recovery and to provide economic recovery for the city's work force.,227,,
1320,0.97,8226.117,8236.194,There's a lot more detail in the spend plan that goes into those type of investments and supporting the work force and that type of thing.,227,,
1321,0.97,8236.194,8266.658,"One of the specific asks is there's at least $150,000 set aside to work with an organization with expertise in developing a plan specifically to act as the catalyst to launch programs and services that will help launch these type of services and so that funding amount is included in the zero zero one that we discussed just this morning but it feels like a while ago to do that work in 2022.",227,,
1322,0.97,8266.658,8302.227,"I also note that, that amendment in sort of Reallocating funds and making some adjustments does leave some of that, some funding in the economic revitalization category for you and your colleagues to make decisions on how to, how to allocate as one time investments in 2022 and so, over the coming weeks we'll be having conversations about which of these is consistent with the spending plan and where there funds available because it adds up.",227,,
1323,0.97,8302.227,8320.779,"All of these adds would add to more than what's available in the jump start fund but there are some resources available and like I said that $650,000 to develop the plan would be spent and happen in 2022.",227,,
1324,0.97,8320.779,8324.282,,228,,
1325,0.97,8324.282,8328.253,Thank you for that reminder Allie and Council member Lewis.,229,,
1326,0.97,8328.253,8330.922,Council member Herbold please go ahead.,229,,
1327,0.97,8330.922,8332.691,Thank you.,230,,
1328,0.97,8332.691,8347.872,I understand sponsor to say that the Bia charter prohibits the Bia revenues to be used for marketing and promoting conventions.,230,,
1329,0.97,8347.872,8354.746,"And that that charter could be changed if the members, the rate payers of the Bia initiated it.",230,,
1330,0.97,8354.746,8372.53,"And so I'm just, I guess the question I have is, has that process begun and is the reason why we're proposing to fund it instead because the process has begun and we've somehow, we've somehow slowed it down.",230,,
1331,0.97,8372.53,8398.857,"I'm just concerned that, if we provide the funding then there's, no incentive for the Bia to change the Ordnance, but if on the other hand, we are somehow blocking or slowing down the changing of the Ordnance I can see why we would want to consider this.",230,,
1332,0.97,8398.857,8402.994,Yeah thank you Council member Herbold that's a good question.,231,,
1333,0.97,8402.994,8408.9,"My understanding is that, you know and we have to go back and talk to visit Seattle more specifically.",231,,
1334,0.97,8408.9,8422.38,"But my recollection from talking to them is that, they were not initially aware how restrictive the original Charter of the Bia was in terms of what it could be spent on.",231,,
1335,0.97,8422.38,8428.787,I don't think the original charter vision having a convention center of the size and scope that we're anticipated to have.,231,,
1336,0.97,8428.787,8434.592,Sort of the scope and scale of convention we would be competitive for attracting.,231,,
1337,0.97,8434.592,8445.603,You know I know there are also some conversations out there right now about the Bia being Rechartered and Addressin a bunch of other things.,231,,
1338,0.97,8445.603,8450.542,Associated with the Bia in terms of the fee structure and other things.,231,,
1339,0.97,8450.542,8454.913,So this could potentially be envisioned in that.,231,,
1340,0.97,8454.913,8459.35,But I don't think it's a 2021 time line.,231,,
1341,0.97,8459.35,8467.258,This is a one time ask because by the time the Bia is changed and fixed and everything else.,231,,
1342,0.97,8467.258,8478.536,"I mean as you're well aware, as a former chair of the relative committee.",231,,
1343,0.97,8478.536,8479.537,These processes take a while.,231,,
1344,0.97,8479.537,8493.818,It's more about the time sensitivity of having the resources to be able to plan out and attract conventions projecting well into the future.,231,,
1345,0.97,8493.818,8498.456,And have the resources to do that now.,231,,
1346,0.97,8498.456,8509.734,And I don't think that is going to Synch up with the current visit Seattle rechartering conversations.,231,,
1347,0.97,8509.734,8511.336,Council member Morales will now more about it.,231,,
1348,0.97,8511.336,8516.241,Being in charter any legislation like that is put off.,231,,
1349,0.97,8516.241,8524.282,So this being a one time add does not get me concerns that it's going to turn into a thing where we are expected to bail this out every year.,231,,
1350,0.97,8524.282,8528.286,I guess that would be my where I would kind of rest it.,231,,
1351,0.97,8528.286,8546.004,And I can add that I have been in communication with the Department of changes around visit Seattle's some legislation potentially coming to the Council next year.,232,,
1352,0.97,8546.004,8547.338,So we will Tbd.,232,,
1353,0.97,8547.338,8550.341,But it's something that visit Seattle has been engaging with Council members.,232,,
1354,0.97,8550.341,8559.484,I think even a few years ago I recall coming around and engaging with Council members on.,232,,
1355,0.97,8559.484,8560.285,Essentially increasing their rate.,232,,
1356,0.97,8560.285,8567.292,So I think that that isn't something they're talking with the right peers about.,232,,
1357,0.97,8567.292,8569.627,And preparing to do something about it.,232,,
1358,0.97,8569.627,8575.433,"But as Council member Lewis noted, it will not happen this year.",232,,
1359,0.97,8575.433,8576.801,Okay.,233,,
1360,0.97,8576.801,8579.37,Thank you very much for the clarifying questions.,233,,
1361,0.97,8579.37,8580.338,Appreciate the answers.,233,,
1362,0.97,8580.338,8586.144,And we are going to move on.,233,,
1363,0.97,8586.144,8592.25,Let's go on to Oed 004.,233,,
1364,0.97,8592.25,8605.763,"All right 0 Oed 481, sponsored by J, Juarez.",233,,
1365,0.97,8605.763,8616.207,This would add business district cohesion and resilience in response to different changes in the neighborhood including the opening of the new light rail station.,233,,
1366,0.97,8616.207,8618.61,"Thank you, council member Juarez go ahead.",234,,
1367,0.97,8618.61,8637.895,"Thank you, and thank you Council member Morales and Strauss for helping me Cosponsorthis.",235,,
1368,0.97,8637.895,8642.634,The investments in the will create great economic opportunities but also channels.,235,,
1369,0.97,8642.634,8650.842,"For example the Kraken ice Plex is expected to bring in about 800,000 new annual visitors to the neighborhood.",235,,
1370,0.97,8650.842,8663.354,So I would like Oed to hire a consultant to approach neighborhood businesses and stake holders to build cohesion and consider solutions for the channels as well as ways to leverage the economic opportunity.,235,,
1371,0.97,8663.354,8701.692,"So we have done this in the past with Oed and Opcd in particular in the last six or seven years we've been working with Opcd in planning for our second light rail station on 130Th that sound transit recently Approvedso this one time investment would provide our office with a better understanding of where the business community stands and how the city can best assist the North gate North area, thank you.",235,,
1372,0.97,8701.692,8703.995,Is there any addition questions or comment.,236,,
1373,0.97,8703.995,8710.601,Council member Morales I don't have any questions on this either so we're going to go ahead and move on to the next one.,236,,
1374,0.97,8710.601,8718.342,"581, this is also sponsored by Council member Juarez and cosponsored by Council member Morales and Strauss.",237,,
1375,0.97,8718.342,8732.323,"This would add $50,000 to general fund one time to Oed to support efforts to connect new and emerging businesses with a vacant commercial space in Lake city.",237,,
1376,0.97,8732.323,8739.464,With a particular focus on mom and pop owned businesses.,237,,
1377,0.97,8739.464,8743.201,And will help organizations like build Lake City together.,237,,
1378,0.97,8743.201,8749.107,Up in district five.,238,,
1379,0.97,8749.107,8751.542,The differences between North gate and gate city.,238,,
1380,0.97,8751.542,8760.651,I'll go through my prepared notes but I want to make a short brief comments.,238,,
1381,0.97,8760.651,8761.886,We already know.,238,,
1382,0.97,8761.886,8766.124,We've known for years already light city has a high area of displacement.,238,,
1383,0.97,8766.124,8772.23,The pandemic accelerated the number of businesses leaving the neighborhood.,238,,
1384,0.97,8772.23,8784.242,Leaving empty store fronts in the main commercial strip.,238,,
1385,0.97,8784.242,8790.448,And there's businesses looking for locations.,238,,
1386,0.97,8790.448,8802.56,Chris Leverson has been a great partner Shráeup.,238,,
1387,0.97,8802.56,8802.793,Ship.,238,,
1388,0.97,8802.793,8804.128,Lake city is highway 522.,238,,
1389,0.97,8804.128,8815.273,So we've had success in slowing down the traffic to get more businesses in there and as we are just starting to kind of lift off the pandemic occurred of course which hurt everybody.,238,,
1390,0.97,8815.273,8822.48,So I had an opportunity Sunday to meet with some of the small business owners and the build Lake City together folks.,238,,
1391,0.97,8822.48,8828.419,And they are actually out there talking to business owners.,238,,
1392,0.97,8828.419,8832.056,"Store front owners, private and to how we fill these store fronts.",238,,
1393,0.97,8832.056,8833.191,Now that we've got traffic slowed down.,238,,
1394,0.97,8833.191,8839.297,Now that we have the restaurants that can do the Streeteries.,238,,
1395,0.97,8839.297,8840.998,Now that we have the tents up.,238,,
1396,0.97,8840.998,8842.066,That doesn't seem to be enough.,238,,
1397,0.97,8842.066,8859.116,"We need to build Lake City back together and so with that I'm hoping that this one time $50,000 to our friends at build Lake City together and other groups like it can bring that vitality back to Lake city.",238,,
1398,0.97,8859.116,8859.817,Thank you.,238,,
1399,0.97,8859.817,8862.587,Thank you very much appreciate it.,239,,
1400,0.97,8862.587,8865.59,And are there any addition committees or comments?,239,,
1401,0.97,8865.59,8868.025,Okay Council member Morales I'm going to flag for you.,239,,
1402,0.97,8868.025,8882.34,I'm going to do some additional work with your office and I would love to talk to central staff as well about that economic resilient compliment and how it could dove tail to investments in North city and North gate.,239,,
1403,0.97,8882.34,8895.353,I also know that as folks saw from our earlier conversation about the omnibus bill we're very interested in the economic resilient section has the blueprint we had committed to in statute.,239,,
1404,0.97,8895.353,8912.27,For lack of a blueprint being submitted to Council this year there are a number of one time investments that we are considering for use for jump start Seattle funding that would allow for us to make some investments that are along the same values and priorities as our spend plan.,239,,
1405,0.97,8912.27,8927.518,And then those one time investments would help to sort of sustain this crisis as the consultant and the process with the executive and the Council and community come together to identify that spend plan for economic resilience in 2023 and beyond.,239,,
1406,0.97,8927.518,8948.873,So you'll be hearing more I think as we try to identify which categories of one time investments that align with our economic resilience categories could potentially be funded this year and I'm interested in learning about these two to make sure there's a nice nexus.,239,,
1407,0.97,8948.873,8949.173,Excellent.,239,,
1408,0.97,8949.173,8955.046,Going back to our conversations around bring business home build will we have a brick and mortar in Lake city?,240,,
1409,0.97,8955.046,8955.68,Oh Yeah.,241,,
1410,0.97,8955.68,8971.429,I might be getting ahead of myself two amendments from now.,242,,
1411,0.97,8971.429,8979.67,That's my next move.,243,,
1412,0.97,8979.67,8985.009,Look for little Debbie fried for it.,243,,
1413,0.97,8985.009,8986.31,Now I'm hungry.,244,,
1414,0.97,8986.31,9005.663,"This would add $300,000 of General fund one time to Oed to support an organization that helps refugee and immigrant women use an expand on their Artis, Analanal skills initiative.",245,,
1415,0.97,9005.663,9010.368,"These are wonderful, this is a wonderful program organization.",246,,
1416,0.97,9010.368,9016.273,I know Council President Gonzalez has been out here to see this.,246,,
1417,0.97,9016.273,9018.642,These are more than anchor tenants.,246,,
1418,0.97,9018.642,9020.277,Valuable community partners.,246,,
1419,0.97,9020.277,9034.158,The economic opportunities for refugee and immigrant women since 2017 the refugee artisan initiative has envisioned creating a welcoming global community that values and invests in refugee and immigrant women.,246,,
1420,0.97,9034.158,9036.827,Located in Lake city.,246,,
1421,0.97,9036.827,9042.7,Rai has been a successful nonprofit you may have seen them recently the other day.,246,,
1422,0.97,9042.7,9046.537,They are on King five and they're now ready to expand.,246,,
1423,0.97,9046.537,9048.639,They have just done phenomenal.,246,,
1424,0.97,9048.639,9052.276,Believe it or not they've been making mask.,246,,
1425,0.97,9052.276,9057.281,They've had an opportunity to leverage to actually employ more women to come in.,246,,
1426,0.97,9057.281,9064.321,I think they started with less than six people using sewing machines and they've done really well.,246,,
1427,0.97,9064.321,9076.634,This one time funding will allow for the Rai to expand and hire four additional women to bring their total to 58 artisans by the ends of 2022.,246,,
1428,0.97,9076.634,9080.304,This would allow them to purchase new equipment and more space.,246,,
1429,0.97,9080.304,9090.981,"And basically that means, more sewing machines and more space because now they're incredibly crowded but they're still turning out phenomenal products.",246,,
1430,0.97,9090.981,9092.249,It's just been amazing.,246,,
1431,0.97,9092.249,9093.451,Any way.,246,,
1432,0.97,9093.451,9106.263,"Washington has accepted over 1,700 Afghan refugees recently and its organizations that Rai that are integral helping to ease the transition and help these women build community and support their families with livable wages.",246,,
1433,0.97,9106.263,9115.272,Every one of these women I would say 99% of them English is not their first language but they do come with skills and more than sewing skills.,246,,
1434,0.97,9115.272,9130.12,The fact we can go from six to 34 to 58 is exciting and we owe a big thank you to Lake City build Lake City together that has worked with Rai and those folks.,246,,
1435,0.97,9130.12,9136.594,I'm hoping I will have support on this project as well.,246,,
1436,0.97,9136.594,9136.927,Thank you.,246,,
1437,0.97,9136.927,9143.033,"Excellent, thank you very much Council member Juarez.",247,,
1438,0.97,9143.033,9148.305,Any additional comments.,247,,
1439,0.97,9148.305,9162.219,Thank you Council member Juarez for the conversation we had about the importance.,247,,
1440,0.97,9162.219,9172.263,This is slightly Reviseed from the prior version.,248,,
1441,0.97,9172.263,9185.109,It would call for Oed to look for specific actions that will be taken to indigenous Pharmacy or market in the North end of Seattle not a farmers market which what was in the material.,248,,
1442,0.97,9185.109,9194.852,"The response is due to the public assets in native communities committee or its successor Committee on September 1, 2022.",248,,
1443,0.97,9194.852,9195.419,Thank you.,249,,
1444,0.97,9195.419,9212.836,This is interesting and if you can just give me a few minutes to just kind of con Tech Contractualize.,249,,
1445,0.97,9212.836,9228.252,"In any count country in tribal communities, good food is good medicine so we believe medicine is good food and healthy food.",249,,
1446,0.97,9228.252,9243.033,"With the Seattle board in our office we partnership with the tribe for healing products, textiles and more.",249,,
1447,0.97,9243.033,9252.61,This would also include traditional medicines and also tribal Foods and all the other things that come from the tribes and their markets.,249,,
1448,0.97,9252.61,9258.582,There's potential for cross over with the pilot program that's already taking place at the Indian health board.,249,,
1449,0.97,9258.582,9268.826,"And it's also taking place in the city's of Portland, Spokane, Oakland, Scotsdale and Phoenix.",249,,
1450,0.97,9268.826,9271.528,All have examples of indigenous markets.,249,,
1451,0.97,9271.528,9274.898,I use the word Pharmacy because that's Western.,249,,
1452,0.97,9274.898,9282.406,And traditionally I'm not sure what other word I can use Besides Pharmacy but it's about food and healthy food.,249,,
1453,0.97,9282.406,9293.25,My office will provide them with an action to move forward our number one priority is finding the correct space and right partners to carry out and facility the markets.,249,,
1454,0.97,9293.25,9299.957,"This is where I want to have, this is based on the history and what I've known working in any country my whole life.",249,,
1455,0.97,9299.957,9308.299,I really want to capitalize on a movement which has been a long time coming and gaining momentum.,249,,
1456,0.97,9308.299,9316.874,Of tribal and urban communities clinic that have been to foster community resiliency.,249,,
1457,0.97,9316.874,9338.896,And Salina health board and other native traditional based organizations are currently have a native Pharmacy so what that means for today what I'm asking is that I hope Seattle like the other six cities and also the Minneapolis native American community clinic that we can expand on our with our indigenous community on this type of indigenous based healing.,249,,
1458,0.97,9338.896,9343.067,We also saw the success of the Seattle Indian health board with their Vaccinations.,249,,
1459,0.97,9343.067,9350.674,This is important and critical to expand the indigenous Footprint in Seattle and by light rail next to housing.,249,,
1460,0.97,9350.674,9354.144,And it's needed because it's native led.,249,,
1461,0.97,9354.144,9376.967,"It's native led wellness, organizations, working to create options for indigenous people in surrounding communities other than the Federal Government and Indian health services which I've known my whole life has historically been chronically under funded due to fluctuating annual appropriations.",249,,
1462,0.97,9376.967,9379.903,That's just the way it's always been.,249,,
1463,0.97,9379.903,9383.507,I've never known it to be any different my whole life.,249,,
1464,0.97,9383.507,9407.798,"My hope is to build a clinic in Collaborations with United Indians, tribal governments with fleet and market including the Macaw and Snoqualmie and we can capitalize with that.",249,,
1465,0.97,9407.798,9413.003,And this is where I want to be a little bit more critical.,249,,
1466,0.97,9413.003,9420.577,There's an important distinction of these indigenous markets than we have now in the city of Seattle.,249,,
1467,0.97,9420.577,9421.845,They're not the same.,249,,
1468,0.97,9421.845,9428.652,And I don't believe that the current farmers market meets the needs of all community members.,249,,
1469,0.97,9428.652,9436.827,And not just indigenous folks ethnic background that have different food and diet issues and needs that I think we need to address.,249,,
1470,0.97,9436.827,9441.098,I know that we are addressing I don't mean to be critical of all the farmers market.,249,,
1471,0.97,9441.098,9450.507,"I am just saying it would be nice to have something that's more tailored to what's indigenous, feasible and what we have here in the Pacific Northwest.",249,,
1472,0.97,9450.507,9458.916,"So I would hope that we have a market, an indigenous pharmacy and to bring in and invite others to bring their food to this particular market.",249,,
1473,0.97,9458.916,9473.897,So in the end I'm hoping that I have the support that we support native led native specific health care organizations in their efforts to offer traditional healing alongside Western medicine.,249,,
1474,0.97,9473.897,9474.398,Thank you.,249,,
1475,0.97,9474.398,9475.632,"Thank you, council member Juarez.",250,,

1480,0.97,9501.425,9502.059,Of course.,252,,
1481,0.97,9502.059,9506.396,Those are Buffalo bars you guys for those of you not in the know.,252,,
1482,0.97,9506.396,9507.164,Now we know.,253,,
1483,0.97,9507.164,9509.132,In case we get hungry.,253,,

1490,0.97,9528.285,9537.194,I would like to add my sponsorship to this item in district one in South del ridge.,258,,
1491,0.97,9537.194,9554.711,We have some new farmers market representing the dietary needs of the East African community and everybody in the neighborhood is flocking to them and it's a real great addition and really appreciate Council member Juarez for bringing this forward.,258,,
1492,0.97,9554.711,9555.078,Thank you.,259,,
1493,0.97,9555.078,9558.682,Thank you very much.,260,,

1495,0.97,9560.284,9561.018,Thank you very much colleagues.,260,,
1496,0.97,9561.018,9566.69,We're going to go ahead and move on.,260,,
1497,0.97,9566.69,9571.561,Council member Herbold just noting again for the record.,260,,
1498,0.97,9571.561,9580.237,Council member Herbold adding her name to zero zero seven.,260,,
1499,0.97,9580.237,9580.771,Oed881.,261,,
1500,0.97,9580.771,9606.863,"This would add $164,000 of General Fund and 1 FTE Stra strategic advisor that would help support.",261,,
1501,0.97,9606.863,9613.003,Thank you for this last amendment.,262,,
1502,0.97,9613.003,9618.108,I think this fits well together.,262,,
1503,0.97,9618.108,9635.192,This would fund a Stra workers would works as a liaison for licensing issues that farmers markets may face with this city.,262,,
1504,0.97,9635.192,9654.711,"As we all know, when farmers markets are special events and are often times subject to many different departments, guidelines, parameters and restrictions so there has been a, there has been difficulty in getting the appropriate response and guidance for a, for the farmers markets across the city.",262,,
1505,0.97,9654.711,9678.368,And then I would again I would add to this amendment if I could that this position should include and implement the recommendations from Council member Juarez recommendations to establishment of an indigenous farmers market.,262,,
1506,0.97,9678.368,9681.238,This FTE is not designed to do one thing or do another thing.,262,,
1507,0.97,9681.238,9698.055,"It is so that there's a one, so that there's one person in the city in our city family that when the farmers markets need help navigating our city bureaucracy that there's one person dedicated to them so that they don't get past around our city, family.",262,,
1508,0.97,9698.055,9710.067,This position would also help inform the long term improvements and city processes to streamline farmer market as a part of the legislative intent that we passed last year.,262,,
1509,0.97,9710.067,9712.369,Thank you chair.,262,,
1510,0.97,9712.369,9712.903,Excellent.,263,,
1511,0.97,9712.903,9714.037,Thank you very much Council member Strauss.,263,,
1512,0.97,9714.037,9727.951,You know I meant to bring this up with you as the cosponsor of the work we did last year with farmers market or talk to central staff about it but I have not had the chance to raise this.,263,,
1513,0.97,9727.951,9736.793,I want to let you know when I had the chance to visit the University district and I saw Council member Pederson there.,263,,
1514,0.97,9736.793,9738.662,Did the ribbon cutting for some transit new stations.,263,,
1515,0.97,9738.662,9744.101,There were a lot of our friends from the farmer market who were in the audience as well.,263,,
1516,0.97,9744.101,9754.311,"They had mentioned to me, their frustration but the funding that we had provided last year wasn't fully implemented.",263,,
1517,0.97,9754.311,9763.32,And concerns about how we had specifically identified additional support for farmers markets but they never received it.,263,,
1518,0.97,9763.32,9774.831,"I wonder if you have any additional information, if you want to remind us what that was and if you have any Intel on why those dollars didn't get placed the way intended.",263,,
1519,0.97,9774.831,9776.133,Yolanda do you want to jump in.,264,,
1520,0.97,9776.133,9807.164,I want to say for the statement of legislative intent included in the budget referring the improvement process and that was not executed because Oed sited capacity constraints so focusing on getting the various economic recovery dollars at the door and so they earlier this year had informed the council member Strauss they were not moving forward on that process improvement work.,265,,
1521,0.97,9807.164,9813.17,The position itself had not been funded in the adopted budget.,265,,
1522,0.97,9813.17,9827.05,Because it was proposed during last year's budget deliberations but elected to not include that this position so that's why it is being brought forth again this year for the councils consideration.,265,,
1523,0.97,9827.05,9830.287,To shed a little bit more light on that.,266,,
1524,0.97,9830.287,9852.075,Last year when we passed the statement of legislative intent it was this position was also put forward as a way to implement that work in conversations with Oeds previous director it was made known that a special events coordinator was what Oed needed and a farmers market liaison was a secondary need.,266,,
1525,0.97,9852.075,9865.055,"I did make it that time a promise, you know an agreement with if we had to fund one program or another that funding with special events coordinator.",266,,
1526,0.97,9865.055,9867.157,As long as they completed this work.,266,,
1527,0.97,9867.157,9884.241,"So that work did not get completed which again just, it demonstrates the issue that farmers markets are experiences with this work that I as a council member am experiences.",266,,
1528,0.97,9884.241,9887.644,Thank you for that background.,267,,
1529,0.97,9887.644,9888.645,Council President Gonzalez please go ahead.,267,,
1530,0.97,9888.645,9893.683,I appreciate the question that the chair is asking and would appreciate getting more information about that.,268,,
1531,0.97,9893.683,9907.063,"You know sort of nonetheless this area is still an area of need and so, just in the spirit of being supportive here and hoping that this item continues to receive some attention I would like to add my name as a cosponsor.",268,,
1532,0.97,9907.063,9912.202,Thank you Ma'am chair.,268,,
1533,0.97,9912.202,9918.208,Thank you very much Council President.,269,,

1536,0.97,9919.976,9933.256,I would like to add my name as a cosponsor too.,270,,
1537,0.97,9933.256,9937.093,I support cutting to the Chase and implementing this.,270,,
1538,0.97,9937.093,9937.427,Thank you.,270,,
1539,0.97,9937.427,9939.496,"Okay, wonderful.",271,,
1540,0.97,9939.496,9940.697,So I appreciate that.,271,,
1541,0.97,9940.697,9944.434,"Council member Pederson, council member Pederson adding his name to Oed 008.",271,,
1542,0.97,9944.434,9961.251,I'm going to let central staff know I would like to get through this next item 0 Ed 009 and before we move off of the office of economic development if we could do a quick summary of how much of the Arca funds.,271,,
1543,0.97,9961.251,9967.824,How much of the American rescue funds has already allocated have actually gone out the door.,271,,
1544,0.97,9967.824,9974.264,I was just in West Seattle in a wonderful small business that Council president and I know well.,271,,
1545,0.97,9974.264,9975.799,A small consignment store up on California Avenue.,271,,
1546,0.97,9975.799,9987.61,"They're going to be merging with another business and it really just, breaks my heart when we have funding that could be out the door right now if it is still sitting on a desk waiting to be deployed.",271,,
1547,0.97,9987.61,9999.489,So before we move off of Oed and on to our next item which would be mine I would like to have a quick summary of how much has been spent if we have an update on those funds on the report that we received about ten days or so.,271,,
1548,0.97,9999.489,10008.932,With that Yolanda can I ask you to read in Oed 009 and we'll come back to that more macro question.,271,,
1549,0.97,10008.932,10009.532,Sure.,272,,
1550,0.97,10009.532,10014.471,Oed 9 a 1 sponsored by Council member Pederson cosponsored by Herbold and Strauss.,272,,
1551,0.97,10014.471,10027.283,This would request that Oed work with the Seattle Department of transportation to develop a strategy for funding and distributing financial assistance to small businesses adversely impact by city led transportation projects.,272,,
1552,0.97,10027.283,10043.5,Would note that just to Council member Pederson's previous point this was a statement of legislative intent that was adopted as part of this 2021 budget that Oed again indicated lack of capacity to address.,272,,
1553,0.97,10043.5,10055.178,"So this is being brought back for your consideration and the response would be due to the community economic development committee or its successor Committee on April 1, 2022.",272,,
1554,0.97,10055.178,10058.948,Thank you very much.,273,,
1555,0.97,10058.948,10061.651,Council member Pederson please go ahead.,273,,
1556,0.97,10061.651,10062.886,Thank you chairman Mosque Da.,274,,
1557,0.97,10062.886,10066.322,Yes this is just bringing back a slide that was not implemented last year.,274,,
1558,0.97,10066.322,10076.466,We heard from lots of small businesses who can be impacted by construction projects that we're excited about.,274,,
1559,0.97,10076.466,10088.244,We're excited about updating our streets and sometimes those projects though do create issues with accessibility and the perception the store might be closed and causing financial impacts.,274,,
1560,0.97,10088.244,10101.491,This is to have Oed and Sdot bring together a program that can help us assist those small businesses that might be negatively impacted by city Ledprojects.,274,,
1561,0.97,10101.491,10106.863,Thank you Council member Pederson.,275,,
1562,0.97,10106.863,10109.966,Are there any additional questions or comments on those.,275,,
1563,0.97,10109.966,10110.867,Thank you Council member Pederson.,275,,
1564,0.97,10110.867,10140.23,"We know we all wanted to learn the lessons from where there were traffic impact and mitigation needs especially on the South end around the creation of light rail so we want to help to make sure that we're supporting our small businesses especially in that example that we're not able to receive I think, let me Rephrase that.",275,,
1565,0.97,10140.23,10151.908,"Especially want to support businesses who are Disproportionally impacted by Covid in this moment, our smallest businesses Disproportionally impacted.",275,,
1566,0.97,10151.908,10157.514,With that before we move off this agenda item we're still on agenda item 15.,275,,
1567,0.97,10157.514,10163.82,"If I could ask central if, if you do have any updates for us on how office of economic development are doing.",275,,
1568,0.97,10163.82,10171.961,How much money they have received from us from the American rescue plan dollars through Seattle rescue plan funds and how much of that has actually gone out the door.,275,,
1569,0.97,10171.961,10185.508,I know this was a question that we had received a week or so ago and appreciate the work that director noble is trying to get information from all of the departments from that question to get greater clarification and specifically in Oed.,275,,
1570,0.97,10185.508,10195.418,That area really stood out to me when we're looking at how much money had been allocated to how much money had been spent.,275,,
1571,0.97,10195.418,10196.92,If you have any updates that will be welcome.,275,,
1572,0.97,10196.92,10202.458,I will start us off and Allie will jump in as needed.,276,,
1573,0.97,10202.458,10209.132,You are correct that the Council's report was it earlier this month feels like a long time ago.,276,,
1574,0.97,10209.132,10214.27,Did not seem satisfying in terms of getting the dollars out the door.,276,,
1575,0.97,10214.27,10223.78,I will just note that Oed recently announced applications for the $4 million in small business grants is now open.,276,,
1576,0.97,10223.78,10236.125,"So and the amounts will be ranging not just the $10,000 but there could be larger or smaller amounts kind of more tailored toward business needs.",276,,
1577,0.97,10236.125,10244.701,They have finally decided on an allocation the direct allocations to neighborhood business organizations for a total of 3.9 million.,276,,
1578,0.97,10244.701,10250.84,And they recently closed the request for proposal for the neighborhood revitalization grant that was 1.2 million.,276,,
1579,0.97,10250.84,10256.279,They will be making a decision on those applications as well.,276,,

1608,0.97,10500.423,10503.092,We had a presentation in our committee meeting I believe at least twice.,285,,
1609,0.97,10503.092,10507.763,I was going say three times but at least three times on those recommendations.,285,,
1610,0.97,10507.763,10521.644,We as a Council submitted a letter back to the domestic board appreciating and acknowledging many of the recommendations.,285,,

1612,0.97,10536.559,10548.271,Part of the resolution movement office of labor standards to collaborate with the community coalition to develop policy and to submit possible legislation to the Council specific to portable benefits as Corina noted.,285,,
1613,0.97,10548.271,10560.549,This was one of the areas colleagues if you remember as we passed the domestic bill of rights that many in the community had asked for inclusion.,285,,
1614,0.97,10560.549,10572.295,Given the complexity of standing up basically another insurance system and an insurance system at a hyper local level in the city of Seattle.,285,,
1615,0.97,10572.295,10584.34,It would have taken a lot more time and it would have been a little more complex to try to pass that as the domestic bill of rights.,285,,
1616,0.97,10584.34,10592.114,To Council on the policy improvements and Tweaks and enhancements they would like to see.,285,,
1617,0.97,10592.114,10618.641,This item is clearly a priority for the domestic boards and Theportable coalition and similar to the conversation that many within the community are having at the national level.,285,,
1618,0.97,10618.641,10629.485,The resolution envisions the domestic workers.,285,,
1619,0.97,10629.485,10678.134,As this Council knows we have taken leadership stance to improve access to protective leave and offer paid leave for officers who have been excluded for Federal protection of starting with the Council that I . that are asking for paid leave in the wake of the pandemic and Lyft and Uber drivers able to access sick leave is something I'm really proud of.,285,,
1620,0.97,10678.134,10710.266,"This is a workers that are often independent contractors that have many hiring entities that they work with and having a portable system that would allow Ahiring . makes a lot of sense we don't want folks to be caring for our Elders, caring for Kiddos.",285,,
1621,0.97,10710.266,10722.445,Entering homes when they should stay home if they're sick that's if the pandemic has Taughts anything it's the respect of sick leave.,285,,
1622,0.97,10722.445,10736.292,We know domestic workers bill of rights was just the beginning in terms of those type of protections we want to see expanded to workers who have been historically left out of Federal and state protections.,285,,
1623,0.97,10736.292,10740.996,And I look forward to working with the coalition.,285,,

1625,0.97,10755.611,10777.466,"I cannot commit a future Council to any specific action but that is really intensive policy work that requires us to make sure that there is an entity, an entity staffed at Ols to provide additional support there and Ols has been a great partner in identifying the way to make sure this is fully staffed and wants to work with the community.",285,,
1626,0.97,10777.466,10789.178,Members who want to be part of that table and I have all of the faith that they will be able to come up with creative solutions to this really intricate channel of providing portable benefits for our domestic workers.,285,,
1627,0.97,10789.178,10795.017,Much more to come as we craft the final pieces for that resolution.,285,,
