48,0.97,262.929,276.042,And we amplified policies at the city level to make sure community preference and affirmative marketing policies are being put forward so we can work to combat displacement as we build new affordable units.,19,,
49,0.97,276.042,281.447,We're funding affordable housing in combination with the equitable development initiative.,19,,
50,0.97,281.447,284.484,So we're creating not just a roof and a door for people to call home.,19,,
51,0.97,284.484,294.327,But a true sense of place and community so that equitable development initiatives can be paired with housing to create child care and community plazas.,19,,

59,0.97,333.433,349.048,And we know more people are going to continue to come to the Seattle region as economic refugees seeking to start their own business or get a good living wage job as immigrants and refugees coming to Seattle because we're a welcoming city and will continue to be.,19,,
60,0.97,349.048,359.625,As more folks come here as climate refugees as well seeking reprieve from extreme heat or weather in other areas of our country and around the globe.,19,,
61,0.97,359.625,363.83,We want to be a welcoming city for everyone who is coming and everyone who has grown here.,19,,

309,0.97,1366.131,1377.743,The reality is access to quality reproductive care has been steadily chipped away by the right wing while Democrats have sat idly by.,108,,
310,0.97,1377.743,1381.947,It would immediately become impossible for a few number of ordinary people if this ruling goes through.,108,,
311,0.97,1381.947,1392.624,And of course there's no reason to believe that this would not provide the basis for a tax on reproductive rights even in States where they're supposedly safe like ours.,108,,

370,0.97,1653.184,1660.258,It's unacceptable that Nancy Pelosi is condemning the far left of the party for being too radical on abortions.,115,,
371,0.97,1660.258,1662.193,70% of Americans support abortion rights.,115,,
372,0.97,1662.193,1663.294,We need this now.,115,,
373,0.97,1663.294,1665.03,It's not enough to be a sanctuary state.,115,,
374,0.97,1665.03,1669.267,We need to make sure these rights are available to working class people everywhere.,115,,
375,0.97,1669.267,1673.571,As well as putting money into abortion funds.,115,,
376,0.97,1673.571,1684.382,"Of course, fundamentally, we need a workers party that learns to fight for working class people and doesn't have to be pushed into action for 50 years.",115,,
377,0.97,1689.688,1696.928,Our next Speaker is Sanja Ponap.,115,,
378,0.97,1696.928,1699.631,I'm in support of this resolution.,116,,
379,0.97,1699.631,1700.965,We must codify it now.,116,,
380,0.97,1700.965,1709.674,The majority of U.S. supports Roe and over 70% oppose it being dismantled.,116,,
381,0.97,1709.674,1712.811,Roe was won under Nixon in a right-wing court.,116,,
382,0.97,1712.811,1717.849,So these unelected Kings and queens on the Supreme Court are sensitive to public pressure.,116,,
383,0.97,1717.849,1719.984,We need everyone to fight for this.,116,,
384,0.97,1719.984,1721.586,I'm pro-choice but also Pro- life.,116,,
385,0.97,1721.586,1729.06,I wish those who are pro-life would join us if they want to save unborn babies.,116,,
386,0.97,1729.06,1731.296,Fight for free birth control.,116,,
387,0.97,1731.296,1732.263,And health care.,116,,
388,0.97,1732.263,1734.899,The Democrats fight for these things too.,116,,
389,0.97,1734.899,1739.037,These are concrete things we need in our lives.,116,,
390,0.97,1739.037,1740.171,Truly reduce abortions.,116,,
391,0.97,1740.171,1741.906,Democrats won't call for these things.,116,,
392,0.97,1741.906,1744.209,We need a real party for ordinary people.,116,,
393,0.97,1744.209,1747.045,We know how to win because we call for social movements.,116,,
394,0.97,1747.045,1748.747,We call for rallies.,116,,
395,0.97,1748.747,1757.889,Protests and Walkouts to demand our rights and decide what's best for ourselves and our bodies.,116,,
396,0.97,1757.889,1758.223,Thank you.,116,,

402,0.97,1769.834,1780.612,"And I want to thank Councilmember Sawant for taking the lead and to, you know, on this--on the struggle for abortion rights.",118,,
403,0.97,1780.612,1791.055,"You know, it reminds me when I'm being told that these rights are safe in Washington of how, you know, we're also told that if union members, our rights are safe.",118,,
404,0.97,1791.055,1798.997,But we saw with the right wing attacking union members that the right to work spread from state to state to nationally through the Janice decision.,118,,
405,0.97,1798.997,1807.806,"So it's clear that, you know, working people and working women, none of us are safe any where without a movement to fight back.",118,,
406,0.97,1807.806,1815.046,"As Martin Luther King said, injustice any where is a threat to justice everywhere.",118,,
407,0.97,1815.046,1818.716,I think this is your party.,118,,
408,0.97,1818.716,1821.653,The Democratic Councilmembers that are not taking action.,118,,
409,0.97,1821.653,1823.121,If you don't call this out.,118,,
410,0.97,1823.121,1824.756,You're every bit complicit.,118,,

416,0.97,1846.11,1854.586,This last week I went out to the demonstrations that materialized just incredibly quickly.,120,,
417,0.97,1854.586,1869.0,And that had a strong impact on city Councilmembers as they consider action from the resolution to stand with us to Fidgeted to--fight for abortion rights.,120,,
418,0.97,1869.0,1871.669,And then I heard over and over again.,120,,
419,0.97,1871.669,1873.504,From speakers and also conversations in the crowd.,120,,
420,0.97,1873.504,1879.611,Was just how angry and disaffected people felt that Democrats standing and fighting with them.,120,,
421,0.97,1879.611,1886.517,I worry that Democrats on the city council don't comprehend the fight that is required.,120,,
422,0.97,1886.517,1894.626,And I think the best thing you can possibly do is be in the streets with us.,120,,
423,0.97,1894.626,1896.427,Stand in solidarity.,120,,
424,0.97,1896.427,1897.929,And be vocal and visible.,120,,
425,0.97,1897.929,1901.466,Our next Speaker is Ellen Anderson.,121,,

427,0.97,1902.667,1904.602,I'm a student at Seattle central.,122,,
428,0.97,1904.602,1912.51,I live in district 3. I'm calling to support Councilmember Sawant's resolution to defend Roe V.,122,,
429,0.97,1912.51,1912.71,Wade.,122,,
430,0.97,1912.71,1915.413,The majority of Americans support abortion rights.,122,,
431,0.97,1915.413,1917.649,This is not a minority issue.,122,,
432,0.97,1917.649,1921.953,This is the general consensus.,122,,
433,0.97,1921.953,1922.52,Nationwide.,122,,
434,0.97,1922.52,1926.424,Over 70% of people oppose dismantling Roe v. wade.,122,,
435,0.97,1926.424,1935.667,And it's the obligation of this Democratic party dominated city Council to call on the congressional Democrats to urgently codify Roe v. wade immediately.,122,,
436,0.97,1935.667,1943.141,And the most important thing about this resolution I think is that it's being put forward in solidarity with the protests that will be happening this week.,122,,
437,0.97,1943.141,1949.013,I think we need to be building for the National day of action on May 14th which has been called by planned parenthood.,122,,
438,0.97,1949.013,1955.92,This is the only way that we can really defend this attack by building a powerful movement in the street.,122,,
439,0.97,1955.92,1969.634,"We need students--student Walkouts, workers, strikes, student rallies.",122,,

446,0.97,1995.159,2001.265,"And along with the grass roots movement, we must pass the strongest resolution possible to defend Roe.",124,,
447,0.97,2001.265,2010.575,"And ensure City resources are being used to ensure and expand reproductive rights and access to abortion, no questions asked.",124,,
448,0.97,2010.575,2013.811,No States are safe from the right-wing attack on Roe V.,124,,
449,0.97,2013.811,2014.011,Wade.,124,,
450,0.97,2014.011,2020.284,"We must do whatever it takes to defend the rights of women, Lgbt folks and ultimately the working class.",124,,
451,0.97,2020.284,2029.627,"The only way we're going to be able to defend the rights, is through nationwide solidarity and action.",124,,

459,0.97,2053.351,2055.853,I was at Carrie park last Tuesday.,126,,
460,0.97,2055.853,2058.656,And the message was simply vote.,126,,
461,0.97,2058.656,2061.159,This is not enough.,126,,
462,0.97,2061.159,2061.426,You know.,126,,
463,0.97,2061.426,2066.063,Biden and Democrats have famed to follow through with so many promises to working people.,126,,
464,0.97,2066.063,2067.765,Including Medicare for all.,126,,
465,0.97,2067.765,2072.203,The 50-Dollar Federal minimum wage.,126,,
466,0.97,2072.203,2074.739,And Codifies Roe v. wade which he campaigned on.,126,,
467,0.97,2074.739,2076.741,So we need to mount a working class fight back.,126,,
468,0.97,2076.741,2082.113,And I want to thank the over 3000 people who showed up at West Lake park Tuesday.,126,,

476,0.97,2126.023,2129.227,I wanted to talk about the county animal shelter.,128,,
477,0.97,2129.227,2141.572,So I guess I would love to learn about how things are put on the agenda so that maybe at a future meeting this is something that I could address.,128,,

482,0.97,2172.703,2172.87,Oh.,129,,
483,0.97,2172.87,2174.972,I didn't actually.,129,,
484,0.97,2174.972,2175.172,Leah?,129,,
485,0.97,2175.172,2176.34,Are you on the line?,129,,
486,0.97,2177.608,2178.276,Hi.,130,,
487,0.97,2178.276,2179.043,My name is Leah.,130,,

490,0.97,2191.822,2195.193,If the Supreme Court over turns Roe verses wade.,130,,
491,0.97,2195.193,2200.598,"It would have a devastating impact on people, falling heavily on marginalized people.",130,,
492,0.97,2200.598,2207.171,Taking away an individual's bodily autonomy and liberty.,130,,
493,0.97,2207.171,2213.11,It's in contrast to Washingtonians who voted to uphold the right to abortion in 1970 and 1991.,130,,
494,0.97,2213.11,2222.286,In Washington we're fortunate that the right to an abortion will still exist after Roe is over turn Bud the right to choose an abortion does not guarantee access.,130,,
495,0.97,2222.286,2228.626,We defend the commitment to provide funding to abortion care.,130,,
496,0.97,2228.626,2234.065,We have seen it decrease access to gender affirming care.,130,,
497,0.97,2234.065,2238.536,It's time to increase rather than decrease access to care.,130,,
498,0.97,2238.536,2243.941,We must stand against forced pregnancies.,130,,
499,0.97,2243.941,2252.083,Our last Speaker is Yvette Magonia.,131,,
500,0.97,2252.083,2256.52,Hello chair member of the committee.,132,,

503,0.97,2269.433,2279.11,So this resolution affirms our city's commitment to abortion access and commits our city to providing funding to ensure meaningful access to abortion care.,132,,
504,0.97,2279.11,2288.552,Planned Parenthood and other Community partners are working to ensure that we have the system and funding in place to help patients access abortion care.,132,,
505,0.97,2288.552,2290.521,Including helping patients traveling from out of state.,132,,
506,0.97,2290.521,2304.001,"Now, more than ever, it's critical for our city and our state to stand up and affirm our commitment to protecting reproductive freedom for all people no matter what happens elsewhere in the country.",132,,

530,0.97,2416.914,2421.685,And so I've requested that we hold this appointment indefinitely on their behalf.,139,,
531,0.97,2422.453,2431.896,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales, and thank you for mentioning the background and briefing.",140,,

535,0.97,2463.394,2478.943,So I would just state that I would hope some equitable way forward could be arranged to make sure that Steve can stay as a partner with city government in public service moving forward if not in this role.,140,,
536,0.97,2478.943,2504.702,And I look forward to talking more with executive officials regarding the appointments of district seven members to the community involvement Commission and how that process goes forward as the District 7 Councilmembers and how we can partner in the future to make sure it's a smooth process for all parties involved.,140,,

562,0.97,2593.023,2596.393,"Thank you, Madame clerk.",159,,
563,0.97,2596.393,2598.963,"I move to adopt the resolution, is there a second?",159,,
564,0.97,2598.963,2599.463,Second.,160,,
565,0.97,2599.463,2604.001,It's been moved and Seconded to adopt the resolution.,161,,
566,0.97,2604.001,2604.468,Councilmember Sawant.,161,,
567,0.97,2604.468,2609.006,"As sponsor of the resolution, you're recognized to address the item.",161,,
568,0.97,2609.006,2611.208,Thank you Council President pro Tem Lewis.,162,,
569,0.97,2611.208,2616.78,This is a resolution to support the rank and file movement to defend Roe v. wade.,162,,
570,0.97,2616.78,2620.417,The right to bodily autonomy for women and Lgbt people.,162,,
571,0.97,2620.417,2621.619,The right to reproductive health care.,162,,
572,0.97,2621.619,2624.455,"And in specific, the right to seek abortion.",162,,
573,0.97,2624.455,2645.643,On May 3RD I joined thousands of protesters in Seattle and many thousands of others around the country marching in opposition to the draft Supreme Court decision that would if allowed to go through obliterate Roe v. wade and historic rights of everyone almost 50 years ago.,162,,
574,0.97,2645.643,2649.313,When a mass movement led by ordinary people in the 60s.,162,,
575,0.97,2649.313,2650.014,And 70s.,162,,
576,0.97,2650.014,2652.016,Fought for and won Roe v. wade.,162,,
577,0.97,2652.016,2661.558,"We're facing the single biggest attack on women, pregnant people, and reproductive rights in our Lifetimes.",162,,
578,0.97,2661.558,2677.808,"In this way, the Supreme Court has given every indication that if they succeed, if we don't fight to stop this in eliminating Roe v. wade, they plan to carry out draconian attacks also on Lgbtq rights next.",162,,
579,0.97,2677.808,2692.556,"As many of the speakers in public comment noted, the Supreme Court is intent on making this attack despite the fact that a majority of Americans support abortion rights and have supported them for Ecades.",162,,
580,0.97,2692.556,2699.963,"To defend against these attacks, we need to build mass grass roots movements that bring in more and more of the working class.",162,,
581,0.97,2699.963,2703.2,And then we need to draw on lessons of history.,162,,
582,0.97,2703.2,2706.303,How was Roe v. wade won in the first place?,162,,
583,0.97,2706.303,2712.476,"It was, and let's be clear about this, it was never due to some benevolence or wisdom of the justice system.",162,,
584,0.97,2712.476,2720.651,Nor was it won by Democratic party aligned organizations that at that time refused to engage in the mass direct action that was needed.,162,,
585,0.97,2720.651,2729.86,"Like all victories for the working class under capitalize, Roe v. wade was wrenched from the hands of the powerful by mass movements led by rank and file workers.",162,,
586,0.97,2729.86,2730.894,By rank and file women.,162,,
587,0.97,2730.894,2752.382,"And by rank and file militant leaders in the Union movement and in the social movement who unlike the Cautiousness used by many of the prominent organizations they understood we needed Marchs on the streets, protest actions, workplace actions.",162,,
588,0.97,2752.382,2752.85,Late work stoppages.,162,,
589,0.97,2752.85,2756.72,The Supreme Court at the time was majority Republican appointed.,162,,
590,0.97,2756.72,2758.522,Just like today.,162,,
591,0.97,2758.522,2762.526,"Majority Sexist, majority racist, majority bigoted.",162,,
592,0.97,2762.526,2765.662,Majority right wing just like today.,162,,
593,0.97,2765.662,2782.379,Yet not only are a majority of the Republican judges voted in favor of Roe v. wade in a 7-2 decision because of the power of mass movements led by working people.,162,,
594,0.97,2782.379,2786.75,Abortion rights were won because of the massive combined pressure of the women's movement.,162,,
595,0.97,2786.75,2789.553,Civil rights movement.,162,,
596,0.97,2789.553,2789.987,Anti-War movement.,162,,
597,0.97,2789.987,2790.354,Labor movement.,162,,
598,0.97,2790.354,2792.956,And militant strike action by Union workers.,162,,
599,0.97,2792.956,2805.903,Literally millions were out on the streets in the U.S. they feared even greater social upheaval and even greater threats to the stability of their system of capitalism.,162,,
600,0.97,2805.903,2809.506,And that's why they were forced to concede on victories like Roe v. wade.,162,,
601,0.97,2809.506,2816.613,For all the women's rights and Lgbtq rights activists watching.,162,,
602,0.97,2816.613,2820.751,"Union and Nonunion workers watching, that's the fear we need to instill now.",162,,
603,0.97,2820.751,2828.125,"Without the fever pitch of mass movements, we will not be able to stop attacks like this.",162,,
604,0.97,2828.125,2835.232,"When worker rights, Lgbt rights, and women's rights are--on the planet.",162,,
605,0.97,2835.232,2852.516,I have little confidence the big business politicians that dominate those parties will do what is necessary to defend Roe v. wade and reproductive health care let alone passing single payer universal health care to make access to all forms of health carefree and available to all.,162,,
606,0.97,2852.516,2853.15,Including taxing Wall Street.,162,,
607,0.97,2853.15,2862.059,"We need to be clear that controlling the house, Senate, and White House, the Democratic party establishment could do this if they had the political will to do so.",162,,
608,0.97,2862.059,2868.398,They could eliminate the filibuster just like Trump's Republicans did in order to appoint right wing Justices.,162,,
609,0.97,2868.398,2872.803,They could pass a law codified Roe v. wade nationwide.,162,,
610,0.97,2872.803,2876.873,They could pass health care paid for by taxing Billionaires.,162,,
611,0.97,2876.873,2879.843,They could expand the size of the student court.,162,,
612,0.97,2879.843,2882.346,Supporting their right to bodily autonomy.,162,,
613,0.97,2882.346,2886.083,They could and should call mass movements to support these actions.,162,,
614,0.97,2886.083,2890.52,They could do automotive of these things if they had the will to do so.,162,,
615,0.97,2890.52,2897.294,The reality is that is not the real program of the establishment of the Democratic party.,162,,
616,0.97,2897.294,2920.25,Which means progressive Dmitris need to decide if they'll use their credentials to make excuses for big business establishments to control their party or they will use every resource at their disposal to build the largest possible mass movement to push all elected officials Democratic and Republican and Supreme Court judges to back off these attacks on women and Lgbtq people.,162,,
617,0.97,2920.25,2924.154,This is asserts the city council's opposition to over turning Roe v. wade.,162,,
618,0.97,2924.154,2928.692,Which I know there's full support on city council for that.,162,,
619,0.97,2928.692,2932.029,But it supports building the grass roots movement we need.,162,,
620,0.97,2932.029,2941.571,This Friday students are calling demonstrations and this Saturday is the National day of action to defend abortion rights called by planned parenthood.,162,,
621,0.97,2941.571,2945.042,This resolution encourages Seattlites to participate in the protests.,162,,
622,0.97,2945.042,2948.478,Urging progressive Democrats to use their resources to build this movement.,162,,
623,0.97,2948.478,2951.048,The resolution commits to funding abortion access.,162,,
624,0.97,2951.048,2963.36,"I understand Councilmember Herbold will be moving a proposed amendment with language recommended by the ACLU, planned Parenthood, Pro- choice Washington, the Northwest abortion access Fund and legal rights.",162,,
625,0.97,2963.36,2968.699,"I want to clarify, consider this amendment a friendly one and we'll be voting in favor of it.",162,,
626,0.97,2968.699,2976.139,And I urge Councilmembers to support this resolution and urge anyone watching this to join me at the demonstration this is Friday and Saturday.,162,,
627,0.97,2976.139,2977.441,Thank you.,162,,
628,0.97,2977.441,2978.508,Thank you.,163,,
629,0.97,2978.508,2979.009,Councilmember Sawant.,163,,
630,0.97,2979.009,2982.579,Are there any other comments?,163,,
631,0.97,2982.579,2983.08,Councilmember Herbold?,163,,
632,0.97,2983.08,2984.448,Thank you so much.,164,,
633,0.97,2984.448,2991.955,I move to amend resolution 32054 as presented on amendment one which was Rentedly distributed.,164,,
634,0.97,2991.955,2992.456,Second.,165,,
635,0.97,2992.456,2996.693,It's been moved and Seconded to adopt amendment one.,166,,
636,0.97,2996.693,3000.163,"Councilmember Herbold as sponsor, you're recognized to discuss your amendment.",166,,
637,0.97,3000.163,3001.765,Thank you so much.,167,,
638,0.97,3001.765,3009.039,I really appreciate the opportunity to bring this amendment and Councilmember Sawant's welcoming its inclusion.,167,,
639,0.97,3009.039,3013.11,It was circulated to all offices just before noon today.,167,,
640,0.97,3013.11,3014.945,And was reviewed by law.,167,,
641,0.97,3014.945,3021.685,I want to thank Roxana Gomez and Leah Rutman.,167,,
642,0.97,3021.685,3023.22,And ACLU Wrrksa.,167,,
643,0.97,3023.22,3034.898,"And Kayla from pro-choice Washington, they convened a group of health care providers and advocates and they did so at very short notice to review the resolution and offer feedback.",167,,
644,0.97,3034.898,3044.641,I understand Councilmember Morales who serves as Cochair representing the city council on the board of health also did outreach to some of the organizations that provide feedback.,167,,
645,0.97,3044.641,3047.644,I really appreciate the coordination and parallel lines of thought there.,167,,
646,0.97,3047.644,3051.848,The amendment here is the result of that work.,167,,
647,0.97,3051.848,3056.82,"And represents recommendations from ACLU Washington, Pro- choice Washington.",167,,
648,0.97,3056.82,3060.69,"Northwest abortion access Fund, planned Parenthood, alliance advocates and legal voice.",167,,
649,0.97,3060.69,3082.245,"I really wanted to make sure that these advocates and experts long on the front line of reproductive justice had the opportunity to review this resolution related to abortion rights at this really critical moment and just real quickly, highlighting what's in the amendment, it changes the Gendered language in the bill.",167,,
650,0.97,3082.245,3088.919,It adds a recital about House bill 1851 which the state Legislature passed this year.,167,,
651,0.97,3088.919,3093.056,And preserves a pregnant individual's ability to access abortion care.,167,,
652,0.97,3093.056,3112.509,And it requests that any funds that a Council may choose to appropriate in the future would be allocated to organizations that deliver programs and services in support of abortion care and access such as the Northwest abortion access Fund and independent abortion clinics.,167,,
653,0.97,3112.509,3117.781,I want to get everybody involved here in developing this amendment for the quick work.,167,,
654,0.97,3117.781,3125.021,Especially during a moment when all hands are needed to prepare for the upcoming crisis and reproductive health care access.,167,,
655,0.97,3125.021,3134.397,And a special thank you to Yolanda and Christina from my office for their quick work in turning around this amendment.,167,,
656,0.97,3134.397,3136.199,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",168,,
657,0.97,3136.199,3142.172,Are there any comments on the proposed amendment one?,168,,

678,0.97,3173.503,3175.005,The motion carries.,186,,
679,0.97,3175.005,3178.808,And amendment one is a documented in the amendment resolutions before the Council.,186,,
680,0.97,3178.808,3186.65,Are there additional comments on the amended resolution?,186,,
681,0.97,3186.65,3187.851,Councilmember Herbold?,186,,
682,0.97,3187.851,3189.052,"Thanks, appreciate that.",187,,
683,0.97,3189.052,3191.288,I just want to add a few things.,187,,
684,0.97,3191.288,3197.594,Because I did actually have the opportunity to add some language prior to the amendment.,187,,
685,0.97,3197.594,3201.731,And I want to lift some of that up as well.,187,,
686,0.97,3201.731,3220.05,When Councilmember Sawant notified the rest of us on Wednesday that she would be sponsoring this resolution as chair with over sight of public health and human services and someone like many of us I know have very strong feelings on this issue.,187,,
687,0.97,3220.05,3224.788,I did request to work with Councilmember Sawant on the drafting of the resolution.,187,,
688,0.97,3224.788,3228.491,I did receive a draft on Friday.,187,,
689,0.97,3228.491,3240.203,"And at that point, rather than offering language before draft was distributed, I took the opportunity with Christina's help to add some additional language to the resolution as well.",187,,
690,0.97,3240.203,3246.276,And I thank Councilmember Sawant for being willing to include it.,187,,
691,0.97,3246.276,3254.184,I want to highlight again the language included LIFTS up sister song's concept of reproductive justice.,187,,
692,0.97,3254.184,3260.991,Acknowledging that there can be no choice without access to comprehensive reproductive health care.,187,,
693,0.97,3260.991,3266.496,It includes a series of recitals that acknowledge limitations to access even here in Washington state.,187,,
694,0.97,3266.496,3280.043,And that's caused by almost 50% of our hospital beds being in religiously affiliated hospitals which refuse to provide the full range of health care that patients require.,187,,
695,0.97,3280.043,3291.388,It signals an intention to consider action that would ensure that patients are informed of reproductive health care available and not available to them at their health care facility.,187,,
696,0.97,3291.388,3306.369,And it States specific choice for the keep our care act that prevents health care system consolidations from moving forward if they negatively impact communities' access to quality health care.,187,,
697,0.97,3306.369,3310.106,"Including reproductive, end of life, and gender affirming care.",187,,
698,0.97,3310.106,3317.847,"Again, thank you Councilmember Sawant for your willingness to incorporate all of this added language into your resolution.",187,,
699,0.97,3317.847,3318.581,This is an issue.,187,,
700,0.97,3318.581,3322.152,I know it's been a very difficult week for folks.,187,,
701,0.97,3322.152,3324.587,This is deeply personal and Impactful to so many lives.,187,,
702,0.97,3324.587,3330.126,And I believe the Council does have a role to play in the crisis to come.,187,,
703,0.97,3330.126,3338.268,I have made some starting inquiries with public health.,187,,
704,0.97,3338.268,3350.68,Whether city dollars support clinics that make referrals that facilitate come comprehensive women's health care.,187,,
705,0.97,3350.68,3352.916,Including all reproductive options.,187,,
706,0.97,3352.916,3374.904,If the Supreme Court does issue a majority opinion consistent with the draft that we've seen the shift in abortion rights will be among the most significant the court has ever issued and that it would deprive half of the nation of a fundamental constitutional right long held by millions of pregnant people for nearly 50 years.,187,,
707,0.97,3374.904,3379.175,We know that 20 States have laws restricting or banning abortions.,187,,
708,0.97,3379.175,3385.648,Some are trigger laws that will go into effect as soon as the Supreme Court ruling.,187,,
709,0.97,3385.648,3390.553,Some are Pro-Roe abortion bans that haven't been enforced.,187,,
710,0.97,3390.553,3398.762,And other laws express a clear intent of States to crack down on abortion permitted by the Supreme Court.,187,,
711,0.97,3398.762,3406.87,States that continue to allow abortion will likely see a large influx of patients seeking care.,187,,
712,0.97,3406.87,3417.447,And Parenthood reported that clinics and States near Texas reported a nearly 800% increase in abortion patients from Texas as compared to the same period in the prior year.,187,,
713,0.97,3417.447,3426.523,Pregnant people of color will bear the brunt of further abortion restrictions with higher poverty rates and more difficulties traveling out of State for an abortion.,187,,
714,0.97,3426.523,3442.405,"And limits on abortion access can lead to negative long-term health care effects and significant--that last for year, single parenthood.",187,,
715,0.97,3442.405,3445.108,I really look forward to working with all of you.,187,,
716,0.97,3445.108,3457.654,And all of our community Stakeholders and women's movements tone sure that access to comprehensive women's health care including access to abortion is a reality on the ground as well as by policy in our city.,187,,
717,0.97,3457.654,3458.922,Thank you.,187,,
718,0.97,3459.622,3461.224,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",188,,
719,0.97,3461.224,3470.333,Are there any other comments on the resolution as amended?,188,,
720,0.97,3470.333,3470.8,Councilmember Nelson.,188,,
721,0.97,3470.8,3473.069,Thank you Councilmember Sawant for bringing this forward.,189,,
722,0.97,3473.069,3483.48,I do think it's very important that Seattle city council speak out and voice our strong opposition to what we think is coming down the Pike here.,189,,
723,0.97,3483.48,3506.603,"And you know, while there are some things in the resolution that gave me pause, I--this is completely about city business and what--how this will impact our constituents despite the fact that access to abortion is--is codified in Washington state.",189,,
724,0.97,3506.603,3517.146,I was talking to Courtney Norman who is the director of the--of planned Parenthood alliance advocates.,189,,
725,0.97,3517.146,3530.46,"And she noted that with the influx of women--of people from other states seeking abortions, that will have a ripple effect in Washington--amongst Washington clinics.",189,,
726,0.97,3530.46,3539.969,And it very well could point to the need to expand our services that we offer at whatever clinics get our funding.,189,,
727,0.97,3539.969,3546.009,And she also noted that Portland did contribute to the abortion access Fund.,189,,
728,0.97,3546.009,3550.013,That is something else that we might consider in the future.,189,,
729,0.97,3550.013,3569.732,But the point is that what's happening at the national level will impact everyone because this is going to cause--this is going to cause people in states that can no longer get abortions to seek alternatives.,189,,
730,0.97,3569.732,3574.337,And Washington should be a welcoming state to meet that need.,189,,
731,0.97,3574.337,3574.57,Thank you.,189,,
732,0.97,3576.306,3583.346,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson, are there any other comments on the resolution?",190,,
733,0.97,3583.346,3587.05,I want to make closing remarks but I was waiting for you to call on me.,191,,
734,0.97,3587.05,3590.053,"Yes, of course, Councilmember Sawant.",192,,
735,0.97,3590.053,3601.831,"I'll just briefly say really appreciate as I said in briefing yesterday the timeliness of the resolution, Councilmember Sawant in your bringing it forward.",192,,
736,0.97,3601.831,3617.18,It's critical not only for us to go on the record in the strongest possible terms against the massive backsliding of abortion rights that would be represented by this potential Court decision.,192,,
737,0.97,3617.18,3634.831,But the implications that decision has for other essential fundamental rights that the court has recognized over the years that have been derived from the same privacy protections that we rely on in Connecticut and other important cases.,192,,
738,0.97,3634.831,3663.993,But it's also critical to bring this forward for many elements of this resolution that call for our region and our city to prepare as a place that's going to be a critical Hub of people being able to receive access to abortion in a--in an affordable and accessible way that they won't be able to do in close by jurisdictions.,192,,
739,0.97,3663.993,3665.395,Particularly the state of Idaho.,192,,
740,0.97,3665.395,3677.173,And that that is going to involve some resource discussions and decisions that we're going to need to make as local governments to safeguard that right and safeguard access to comprehensive health care.,192,,
741,0.97,3677.173,3689.285,Including the right and ability to access safe abortion procedures so I think this is a very timely resolution.,192,,
742,0.97,3689.285,3693.756,I appreciate the amendments Councilmember Herbold brought forward.,192,,
743,0.97,3693.756,3700.93,"With that, Councilmember Sawant, I think it is to you--sorry Councilmember Morales, please.",192,,
744,0.97,3700.93,3701.364,My apologies.,193,,
745,0.97,3701.364,3704.767,I was late on the draw there.,193,,
746,0.97,3704.767,3711.274,I also want to thank Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Herbold.,193,,
747,0.97,3711.274,3719.715,We did work in my office just to make sure that we're hearing from the actual abortion care providers and advocates.,193,,
748,0.97,3719.715,3725.188,And everybody agrees that this is an incredibly important for us to do as a city.,193,,
749,0.97,3725.188,3728.925,I think we all know what this is really about.,193,,
750,0.97,3728.925,3734.53,I spoke briefly at briefing yesterday.,193,,
751,0.97,3734.53,3742.238,"But as we all know, this is not about abortion per se, this is about controlling women's bodies.",193,,
752,0.97,3742.238,3749.145,"And controlling their ability to make their own decisions about their bodies, their family, their community.",193,,
753,0.97,3749.145,3760.99,So it's important that we are providing this public statement about what we will do as a city to protect people who need this care.,193,,
754,0.97,3760.99,3775.905,So I look forward to working with my colleagues to identify specifically what we are able to do as a city and to work with King County public health and with the state to make sure we're providing as much protection as we can for people.,193,,
755,0.97,3775.905,3780.176,So thank you for everyone being on board with providing this care.,193,,
756,0.97,3780.843,3782.411,Spheek,193,,
757,0.97,3783.379,3785.915,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,194,,
758,0.97,3785.915,3787.383,"Councilmember Sawant, close us out on this resolution.",194,,
759,0.97,3787.383,3791.487,"Thank you so much, Council President pro Tem Lewis.",195,,
760,0.97,3791.487,3808.905,"I really appreciate the comments from the Councilmembers O who spoke in support of abortion rights and upholding Roe v. wade and in support of the resolution, I'm thanking all Councilmembers in anticipation that all Councilmembers will be voting yes.",195,,
761,0.97,3808.905,3818.581,And I completely agree with the point made that we should do everything in our power as a city and as city Councilmembers to expand funding for services.,195,,
762,0.97,3818.581,3833.996,"And show our solidarity materially, concretely, with people in other States who will need these services and that is precisely why the resolution says that explicitly in the language.",195,,
763,0.97,3833.996,3836.599,And that's a reason the resolution passes today.,195,,
764,0.97,3836.599,3847.443,"And I hope other city councils in other cities, not only Washington state but other states also, follow this example and do this.",195,,
765,0.97,3847.443,3862.058,"As a Socialist, I feel like my duty is to go beyond that and also talk about why--why we're facing this attack in the first place.",195,,
766,0.97,3862.058,3864.493,"The point that I made, and other speakers made.",195,,
767,0.97,3864.493,3871.968,That we're here in the first place because we have not seen the Democratic party establishment fight in the way it needs to fight.,195,,
768,0.97,3871.968,3875.238,The Democratic party has had 50 years to have codified Roe V.,195,,
769,0.97,3875.238,3875.438,Wade.,195,,
770,0.97,3875.438,3880.076,They could have done it in any of the periods they have had.,195,,
771,0.97,3880.076,3881.143,The majority in Congress.,195,,
772,0.97,3881.143,3888.651,So that's why the resolution also talks ability about why it's important to push to codify.,195,,
773,0.97,3888.651,3894.657,I'll be clear that I don't believe at this moment there's enough pressure on congressional Democrats to do this.,195,,
774,0.97,3894.657,3898.995,That's why this resolution is a small but important step in my view to do this.,195,,
775,0.97,3898.995,3905.768,"Ultimately, it will be important for mass protests to turn out this week and in the coming weeks.",195,,
776,0.97,3905.768,3912.875,And also to be.,195,,
777,0.97,3912.875,3917.78,There is a very determined current of right wing pushing for this.,195,,
778,0.97,3917.78,3922.418,That is why in addition to mass protests we need mass workplace action.,195,,
779,0.97,3922.418,3925.454,We need militant workplace action.,195,,
780,0.97,3925.454,3929.225,"And we need Nonviolence, civil disobedience actions as well.",195,,
781,0.97,3929.225,3936.198,And all of those actions should begin a conversation about the need for what kind of political party working people need.,195,,
782,0.97,3936.198,3946.842,"And in my view, working people need a new party that will fight against this kind of oppression like Sexism, Phobia, and Trans Phobia.",195,,
783,0.97,3946.842,3952.248,"And attacks on people of color, especially racism against the black community.",195,,
784,0.97,3952.248,3957.119,And we need a party that will actually stand with rank and file workers.,195,,
785,0.97,3957.119,3969.231,Both Union and Nonunion in order to put forward not only the struggle inside the workplace but the movement to stand up in solidarity against these kind of attacks.,195,,
786,0.97,3969.231,3970.032,Thank you.,195,,
787,0.97,3970.032,3972.735,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,196,,
788,0.97,3972.735,3988.784,"With that, let's go ahead and call the role on passage of the resolution.",196,,
789,0.97,3988.784,3989.085,Excuse me.,196,,
790,0.97,3989.085,3990.686,Councilmember Mosqueda may have a word.,196,,
791,0.97,3990.686,3991.821,Thank you Mr. President.,197,,
792,0.97,3991.821,3995.424,Sorry to be late on dent INS as well.,197,,
793,0.97,3995.424,3997.693,I do want to emphasize my support for this.,197,,
794,0.97,3997.693,3999.362,In the twelve or so hours.,197,,
795,0.97,3999.362,4004.633,Less than 24 hours after the announcement came out.,197,,
796,0.97,4004.633,4006.736,Many were asking what does this mean for Seattle.,197,,
797,0.97,4006.736,4010.773,Who's been on the record for Seattle supporting health care access.,197,,
798,0.97,4010.773,4025.354,"Many of us made comments in the wake of the 2017 election as well with many concerns about how the Federal election, the Presidential election was going to affect women's access and people's access to reproductive justice.",197,,
799,0.97,4025.354,4040.936,"And I think that the comments that we're making here today, via this resolution really continue to emphasize the long standing commitment that Seattle has had to protecting folk's ability to access reproductive justice.",197,,
800,0.97,4040.936,4042.705,Health care is reproductive care.,197,,
801,0.97,4042.705,4045.508,And I appreciate the amendments put forward as well.,197,,
802,0.97,4045.508,4050.646,"By today's action, folks are signaling support for continuing the discussion.",197,,
803,0.97,4050.646,4057.787,"And beyond discussion, the commitments in the budget for the upcoming year to make sure that we continue to provide the resources.",197,,
804,0.97,4057.787,4065.561,I wasn't able to comment on whether or not the Council would be able to have a unified perspective on that going into the budget deliberations.,197,,
805,0.97,4065.561,4068.431,But I think this resolution Codifys that interest.,197,,
806,0.97,4068.431,4080.576,And I hope that will send a United message to the executive as well as the budget is being considered for up the coming 2023-2024 deliberations.,197,,
807,0.97,4080.576,4088.784,Obviously we want to make sure that as we consider protections that have resources to make sure folks have access to safe abortions.,197,,
808,0.97,4088.784,4095.825,Protect people who need to have freedom from Harassment and assault or disruptions at those abortion clinics.,197,,
809,0.97,4095.825,4104.6,And make sure that we're providing specific support for people who will be traveling in and out of our city if it comes to that.,197,,
810,0.97,4104.6,4119.648,I look forward to working with our colleagues here and other localities across the country as we continue to fight back by providing resources and protection along with the necessary health care as part of the National response.,197,,
811,0.97,4119.648,4134.83,And I appreciate that this is a joint call for not only resources and direct action but for congressional members to take action along with the Federal delegation and President to codify and statute Roe v. wade.,197,,
812,0.97,4134.83,4141.17,So looking forward to how we can continue this discussion via resources in the upcoming budget.,197,,
813,0.97,4141.17,4142.505,"Thanks, colleagues.",197,,
814,0.97,4142.505,4144.406,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda.,198,,
