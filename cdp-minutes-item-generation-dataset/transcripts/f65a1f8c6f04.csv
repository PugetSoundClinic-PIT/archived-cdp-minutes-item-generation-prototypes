386,0.97,1790.622,1801.466,"I'm hear to speak on behalf of the Mayor's appointment--I'm sorry, of Catherine Mcdowall.",63,,
387,0.97,1801.466,1810.708,I wanted to take a few moments just to say that I look forward to her being an ally in Seattle municipal court.,63,,
388,0.97,1810.708,1817.182,Our court is on the move to do some fundamental and some dynamic changes in the way we handle cases.,63,,
389,0.97,1817.182,1826.925,Especially in light of the fact that our court and many courts around the country have been seen as institutions where discrimination occurred.,63,,
390,0.97,1826.925,1832.997,"She is excited about the work we're doing, such as community court.",63,,
391,0.97,1832.997,1848.446,"In the time I have known her, when I joined the court, I have found her to be Alined with the work, enthusiastic, and committed to not just justice, but equal and fair justice.",63,,
392,0.97,1848.446,1852.817,So I hope that you all support the nomination of her name to the bench.,63,,
393,0.97,1852.817,1857.155,And I look forward to her being my colleague.,63,,
394,0.97,1857.155,1857.422,Thank you.,63,,
395,0.97,1857.422,1858.923,Thank you.,64,,
396,0.97,1858.923,1859.29,Appreciate it.,64,,
397,0.97,1859.29,1868.766,"And then our last Speaker, truly our last Speaker, is Alicia Crawley.",64,,
398,0.97,1868.9,1869.133,Hello.,65,,
399,0.97,1869.133,1869.467,Good morning.,65,,
400,0.97,1869.467,1871.069,Can you hear me?,65,,
401,0.97,1871.069,1872.103,Yes.,66,,
402,0.97,1872.237,1872.47,Great.,67,,
403,0.97,1872.47,1876.841,Thank you for the opportunity to speak today.,67,,
404,0.97,1876.841,1881.212,I had a technical issue earlier.,67,,
405,0.97,1881.212,1882.614,I'm a long-time Seattle resident.,67,,
406,0.97,1882.614,1888.553,I was born here and lived here for almost my entire life.,67,,
407,0.97,1888.553,1891.789,Currently a district one resident in was Seattle.,67,,
408,0.97,1891.789,1908.039,I want to echo the people who have spoke earlier about encouraging you and urging you to override--vote to override the Mayor's veto this afternoon.,67,,
409,0.97,1908.039,1922.487,"I'm concerned about the overfunded, ineffective, and out of control police Department that I have witnessed harass and Brutalize and terrorizing and arresting innocent people and protesters increasingly over the last four months.",67,,
410,0.97,1922.487,1926.891,It's an obscene waste of budget and our grossly imbalanced budget.,67,,
411,0.97,1926.891,1951.049,"We have an opportunity today to start the work with a Crumb, a tiny fraction of what this Council promised to support and vote for in Defunding our SPD and reinvesting the funds into black and Brown communities moving forward.",67,,
412,0.97,1951.049,1956.287,"And that work, yes, it can start next year with more planning, but it needs to start now.",67,,
413,0.97,1956.287,1974.372,"And right now, without overriding the bill, it would take the Council's previous commitment to Defunding and investing in community into a bill that does not reduce the size of SPD, does not take away any funding from SPD.",67,,
414,0.97,1974.372,1980.345,Even the $3.5 million would be a significant start in the right direction.,67,,
415,0.97,1980.345,1984.148,We cannot keep the navigation team in place.,67,,
416,0.97,1984.148,1984.649,Please override this.,67,,
417,0.97,1984.649,1988.419,I support Decriminalize Seattle and King County equity now.,67,,
418,0.97,1988.419,1992.39,Please vote to invest in public safety solutions that work for all of our communities.,67,,
419,0.97,1992.39,1992.657,Thank you.,67,,
420,0.97,1992.79,1995.326,Thank you so much.,68,,

444,0.97,2051.649,2052.517,"Yes, please.",77,,
445,0.97,2052.517,2052.784,Go ahead.,77,,
446,0.97,2052.784,2052.917,.,77,,
447,0.97,2052.917,2053.151,Okay.,78,,
448,0.97,2053.151,2057.255,Thank you very much for taking this time to listen to me.,78,,
449,0.97,2057.255,2063.661,I wanted to speak about a couple of things here.,78,,
450,0.97,2063.661,2070.234,"First of all, not only Defunding police isn't just a negative, it's also a positive.",78,,
451,0.97,2070.234,2077.375,"It will provide money to do community research projects, which I think is very important as we begin a budget process.",78,,
452,0.97,2077.375,2085.883,"And also, it will help engage community in Prioritizing needs.",78,,
453,0.97,2085.883,2092.457,I'm a sociologist and I'm excited about the possibility of this program.,78,,
454,0.97,2092.457,2095.193,"But also, I want to speak personally.",78,,
455,0.97,2095.193,2096.828,I live on Capitol Hill.,78,,
456,0.97,2096.828,2104.101,And I was assaulted a couple of months ago here by a severely mentally ill person in front of my house on 17th.,78,,
457,0.97,2104.101,2109.607,And it was hard for me to call the police.,78,,
458,0.97,2109.607,2112.443,I did because I felt he could actually kill somebody.,78,,
459,0.97,2112.443,2120.852,"But when they heard I wouldn't press charges, they just hung up and never showed up.",78,,
460,0.97,2120.852,2128.159,My first thought before I went to urgent care was why don't we have supportive housing?,78,,
461,0.97,2128.159,2132.797,Why isn't there a team I can call when someone is having a mental health crisis.,78,,
462,0.97,2132.797,2144.976,"We need to allocate far more money to this sort of issue that is helping support severely mentally ill people, people are Addictions.",78,,
463,0.97,2144.976,2148.746,The police are not the people to do that.,78,,
464,0.97,2148.746,2153.251,I am urging you to override the Mayor's veto.,78,,
465,0.97,2153.251,2157.054,We need this money for more positive approaches to public safety.,78,,
466,0.97,2157.054,2159.123,Thank you very much.,78,,
467,0.97,2159.257,2159.59,Thank you.,79,,

518,0.97,2450.581,2456.587,I became an attorney because I wanted to work with individuals directly and help people with their problems.,88,,

520,0.97,2465.596,2472.703,I am interested in working from the Commission because I strongly believe in fairness and the administration of due process and employment.,88,,

529,0.97,2526.957,2582.212,"I want to, again, highlight that the particular Commission is important not just within the context of the disciplinary process and the role that the public safety civil service Commission plays in that process, but it is a body that the efforts of the part of this Council to look at ways of reducing the number of police officers in the police Department, particularly police officers who might have a history of disciplinary violations that make them less able to fulfill the roles of their job as police officers because of their presence on a Brady list.",89,,
530,0.97,2582.212,2588.652,And the applicable rule that allows for out of line--out of order Vetoes.,89,,

648,0.97,3376.84,3391.421,And also your announcements that you intend to eliminate all criminal fines and fees such as the probation supervision fee that you're not statutorily obligated to impose.,105,,
649,0.97,3391.421,3412.609,"And finally, a significant, I think, policy change for the court recognizing that current and future warrants on nearly all Non-Dv, Non-Dui cases be eligible for personal Recognizance release so that people will not sit in jail for low level misdemeanor warrants.",105,,

664,0.97,3486.649,3492.255,"After about two years, John convinced me this was the better Washington and I moved here in 1997.",108,,
665,0.97,3492.255,3499.362,"Although I felt channelled and interested in my work in private practice, I found myself feeling unfulfilled.",108,,

672,0.97,3543.339,3551.247,The events of this year have forced courts in our state to handle two public health crises.,108,,
673,0.97,3551.247,3556.819,"The first, obviously, the logistic challenges of handling court business during a global health crisis.",108,,
674,0.97,3556.819,3564.894,The second is of course the consistent and persistent problem of systemic racism.,108,,
675,0.97,3564.894,3569.866,"These Crisises created an environment for change, and also provided the momentum for change.",108,,
676,0.97,3569.866,3581.21,"As you heard from judge Gregory, the judges on the court have already demonstrated a willingness to evaluate court procedures and develop new procedures to address these issues.",108,,
677,0.97,3581.21,3594.757,"These events of this year, along with the progressive optimism of the judges that serve on the court inspired me to return to work full time and apply for the open position on Seattle mu Nis pal court.",108,,

688,0.97,3644.674,3674.804,"Before moving on, I do want to underscore that the appointment process as described by Michelle Chen earlier is designed to promote maximum independence from the appointing authority.",109,,
689,0.97,3674.804,3694.057,And so that's why there is this requirement for there to be a evaluation committee that makes recommendations of the most highly rated individuals being interviewed.,109,,
690,0.97,3694.057,3701.397,And that evaluation committee makes recommendations to the Mayor of the top three individuals that they have rated.,109,,
691,0.97,3701.397,3735.364,"And as Michelle mentioned earlier, we do have a letter in the record signed by representatives from the Washington women lawyers, the Asian bar Association of Washington, the Lauren Miller bar Association, law of Washington, the Korean American bar Association of Washington, the public defenders Association.",109,,

694,0.97,3748.478,3751.08,So the appointee pro Tem Mcdowall comes very highly recommended.,109,,
695,0.97,3751.08,3765.328,"And was Vetted through the process that is, again, intended to promote independence and the transparency in the process itself.",109,,

715,0.97,3827.723,3830.393,Not Council President Lewis.,118,,
716,0.97,3830.393,3838.334,I wanted to briefly congratulate judge Mcdowall on the successful vote to put her nomination forward.,118,,
717,0.97,3838.334,3853.115,"I wanted to just personally share that as an attorney, I have appeared in front of Judge Mcdowall and I know her to be a conscientious, diligent, and Impotential jurist and leader in the municipal court.",118,,
718,0.97,3853.115,3864.493,"I look forward to working with her on the future of community court, on diversion, on making sure that we Aconspire to have a court with the most progressive practices in the country.",118,,
719,0.97,3864.493,3870.099,"And now that we have officially sent her forward to full Council, I wanted to make the brief comments.",118,,
720,0.97,3870.099,3879.275,I look forward to working with her in this new capacity and appreciate her service and willingness to be nominated and take on this new role.,118,,
721,0.97,3879.275,3880.843,Thank you.,119,,
722,0.97,3880.843,3881.177,Thank you.,120,,
723,0.97,3881.177,3885.081,"This appointment will move on to full Council on Tuesday, September 29th.",120,,
724,0.97,3885.081,3898.327,"And yes, I absolutely echo Councilmember Lewis's gratitude for your willingness to serve, as well as congratulations to you for this new role.",120,,
725,0.97,3898.461,3903.866,Thank you so much for your time and consideration.,121,,
726,0.97,3903.866,3904.367,I really appreciate it.,121,,
727,0.97,3904.5,3904.8,All right.,122,,
728,0.97,3904.8,3914.243,"Alex, read item three Introo the record.",122,,
729,0.97,3914.243,3915.911,Council bill 119893.,123,,
730,0.97,3915.911,3931.16,"Whistleblower protection code Expabding the definition of, quote, report in the city of Seattle Whistleblower protection ordinance and amending section 42805 of the municipal code.",123,,
731,0.97,3931.16,3932.795,.,123,,
732,0.97,3932.795,3933.429,"Thank you very much, Alex.",124,,
733,0.97,3933.429,3945.942,So this bill before us AMENDS the Whistleblower protection code to provide Whistleblower protection to employees who report improperly government actions to the inspector general.,124,,
734,0.97,3945.942,3949.211,It does so by amending the definition of report in the Whistleblower protection code.,124,,
735,0.97,3949.211,3963.125,And I'm not sure who wants to kick it off.,124,,
736,0.97,3963.125,3970.232,Maybe I will default to Lish Whitson to present?,124,,
737,0.97,3970.232,3971.334,"Thank you, Councilmembers.",125,,
738,0.97,3971.334,3972.668,You basically said what I was going to say.,125,,
739,0.97,3972.668,3976.439,The bill is fairly simple.,125,,
740,0.97,3976.439,3982.511,It adds reports of improper governmental action by the Seattle police Department to the office of the inspector general for public safety.,125,,
741,0.97,3982.511,3997.793,"If retaliation against an employee for the report to the Oig occurs, they would have recourse to the process.",125,,
742,0.97,3997.793,4010.973,"Amy Thai and Mary Dory are here, and Wayne Barnett to provide background on the Oig process and the Whistleblower protection process.",125,,
743,0.97,4010.973,4012.842,Great.,126,,
744,0.97,4012.842,4013.109,Thank you.,126,,
745,0.97,4013.109,4025.087,"So for our friends from the office of the inspector general, can you speak a little bit to the need for this change in the Whistleblower protection code?",126,,
746,0.97,4025.221,4025.421,Yes.,127,,
747,0.97,4025.421,4025.688,Thank you.,127,,
748,0.97,4025.688,4033.662,"This is Amy Tsai, deputy Inspector General for the office of Inspector general.",127,,
749,0.97,4033.662,4038.2,"One, we would like to say that we Express support for the legislation.",127,,
750,0.97,4038.2,4044.807,We are here to answer questions and we thank you for your consideration of it.,127,,
751,0.97,4044.807,4053.516,"In regards to the need, the Oig will conduct audits of the police Department and the Oversite of the office of police accountability.",127,,
752,0.97,4053.516,4058.988,We will interview people and people will want to tell us things.,127,,
753,0.97,4058.988,4059.955,They want to come forward.,127,,
754,0.97,4059.955,4067.329,One barrier to them coming forward is the fact that we are not covered under the Whistleblower protection code.,127,,
755,0.97,4067.329,4070.599,There are other protections and mechanisms to support them.,127,,
756,0.97,4070.599,4072.601,But this is a critical piece.,127,,
757,0.97,4072.601,4074.003,So that's the quick answer.,127,,
758,0.97,4074.003,4089.085,"And then if you have any further follow-up for that, we have Mary Dory from the auditing staff here to answer questions about situations and anything else you might have questions about.",127,,
759,0.97,4089.085,4090.753,"Thank you, Amy.",128,,
760,0.97,4090.753,4116.445,"Mary, I guess open ended question, do you have anything to add about the kinds of situations that might have arisen in previous work of the Oig office that maybe in the past might have given rise to the need for this kind of legislation or that you see looking forward instances where this kind of protection would be useful?",128,,
761,0.97,4116.579,4121.083,"Thank you, Councilmember.",129,,
762,0.97,4121.083,4121.25,Yes.,129,,
763,0.97,4121.25,4125.988,"So in our audits, we do a lot of different things.",129,,
764,0.97,4125.988,4126.922,"We look at documentation, data.",129,,
765,0.97,4126.922,4145.107,"Particularly when we're trying to figure out where things may have gone wrong, having people come forward and talk to us about things that may have happened some time ago or things not captured in the written public record is critical for our work and has been helpful in the past.",129,,
766,0.97,4145.107,4153.582,"In the K-9 report, so much of the information, it was critical to have employees feel comfortable honestly sharing about what was going on in the unit.",129,,
767,0.97,4153.582,4158.12,"We have had issue INS the past, I can think of one particular one.",129,,
768,0.97,4158.12,4166.028,We had an employee who alleged that the particular issue we were looking into had occurred before and occurred before more severely.,129,,
769,0.97,4166.028,4187.616,They said they had a box of documentation in their personal possession at home that would provide evidence that they felt uncomfortable coming forward without the Whistleblower protections because their personal situation was precarious enough that they couldn't endure the retaliation.,129,,
770,0.97,4187.616,4191.487,They ended up not feeling comfortable sharing the documentation with us.,129,,
771,0.97,4191.487,4196.825,"In many cases, we are able to establish a relationship and people feel comfortable sharing with us.",129,,
772,0.97,4196.825,4202.631,"For the occasions that people want the additional protection, it would help our work greatly.",129,,
773,0.97,4202.631,4221.083,It's helpful to understand sort of the real world implications of these really important protections that we offer public servants who serve on behalf of taxpayers in our city.,130,,
774,0.97,4221.083,4233.596,"And I think in order for us to expect from them behavior of the highest integrity, we have to also make sure that we are offering protections to them as well.",130,,
775,0.97,4233.596,4244.273,And I think maybe that might be--I'm not seeing questions from my colleagues on the Council.,130,,
776,0.97,4244.273,4254.984,I'll turn it over to director Barnett for additional comments he may have as the head of the agency that works to enforce our Whistleblower protection code.,130,,
777,0.97,4255.117,4257.019,Thank you.,131,,
778,0.97,4257.019,4260.389,I just would make two brief comments.,131,,
779,0.97,4260.389,4270.165,The first is so explain the reason Oig is not covered in the law right now is because the agency was created after the last time we amended the law.,131,,
780,0.97,4270.165,4276.872,This is more of a technical change than anything to update the law to take into account a new agency.,131,,
781,0.97,4276.872,4289.685,And the purpose of the Whistleblower protection code is to encourage employees to come forward with information that they have about improper government actions.,131,,
782,0.97,4289.685,4294.289,Oig is an agency created to root out the improper actions in SPD.,131,,
783,0.97,4294.289,4297.526,It makes all the sense in the world to add them.,131,,
784,0.97,4297.526,4298.527,That's it.,131,,
785,0.97,4298.527,4303.165,"Thank you so much, director Barnett.",132,,
786,0.97,4303.165,4312.508,"Councilmembers, does anybody have a question that they would like to ask regarding the impact of the bill?",132,,
787,0.97,4312.508,4312.775,All right.,132,,
788,0.97,4312.775,4316.845,Seeing no questions.,132,,
789,0.97,4316.845,4320.449,I move to pass Council bill 119893.,132,,
790,0.97,4320.449,4322.751,May I have a second?,132,,
791,0.97,4322.885,4324.653,Second.,133,,
792,0.97,4324.787,4329.324,Thank you.,134,,
793,0.97,4329.324,4332.127,"Alex, can you call the roll?",134,,
794,0.97,4332.127,4332.261,.,134,,
795,0.97,4332.261,4332.795,Councilmember her bold?,135,,
796,0.97,4332.795,4333.028,Yes.,136,,
797,0.97,4333.162,4339.835,Councilmember Lewis.,137,,
798,0.97,4339.835,4340.135,Yes.,138,,
799,0.97,4340.135,4341.337,Councilmember Morales.,139,,
800,0.97,4341.337,4341.57,Yes.,140,,
801,0.97,4341.57,4342.337,Council President Gonzalez?,141,,
802,0.97,4342.337,4342.571,Yes.,142,,
803,0.97,4342.705,4343.672,Thank you.,143,,
804,0.97,4343.672,4348.944,Four in favor and no opposed.,143,,

806,0.97,4349.078,4349.478,Thank you.,144,,
807,0.97,4349.478,4352.748,"The Council bill will go to full Council on Tuesday, September 29th.",144,,
808,0.97,4352.748,4360.522,Thank you all for bringing this important reform forward.,144,,
809,0.97,4360.522,4380.476,And I really appreciate all of the work that everybody is doing in this time to make sure that our city employees are empowered to act with integrity and ethics.,144,,
810,0.97,4380.476,4386.315,"Really, again, appreciate you identifying this small but important change that we all can make together.",144,,
811,0.97,4386.315,4390.619,All right.,144,,
812,0.97,4390.619,4396.058,"Alex, can you read item number four into the agenda.",144,,
813,0.97,4396.191,4404.466,"Item number four, analysis of Court-Imposed monetary sanctions in Seattle municipal court.",145,,
814,0.97,4404.466,4407.236,Great.,146,,
815,0.97,4407.236,4410.272,Who do we have joining us today?,146,,
816,0.97,4410.272,4411.774,Eight number four.,146,,
817,0.97,4411.774,4416.412,Can we do a quick round of introductions for Presenters on this item?,146,,
818,0.97,4416.545,4421.717,"Good morning, council.",147,,
819,0.97,4421.717,4426.522,Aim Caedmon Cahill from the Seattle office of civil rights.,147,,
820,0.97,4426.522,4427.756,Thank you.,148,,
821,0.97,4427.756,4434.43,Good morning I'm professor Alexis Harris from the University of Washington Department of sociology.,149,,
822,0.97,4434.43,4434.696,Great.,150,,
823,0.97,4434.696,4440.302,And professor Frank Edwards from the Rutgers school of criminal justice.,151,,
824,0.97,4440.302,4440.702,Fantastic.,152,,
825,0.97,4440.702,4441.003,Thank you.,152,,
826,0.97,4441.003,4458.02,And so this was a report that I know the office of civil rights worked with Dr. Harris and Seattle municipal Court in moving forward.,152,,
827,0.97,4458.02,4462.991,I don't know if you have additional background to provide before we jump in?,152,,
828,0.97,4462.991,4463.125,.,152,,
829,0.97,4463.125,4464.326,Sure.,153,,
830,0.97,4464.326,4464.66,Thank you.,154,,
831,0.97,4464.66,4465.06,Really briefly.,155,,
832,0.97,4465.06,4484.046,This report was generated in response to a 2016 Council resolution that established the round tree group and requested an inventory and assessment of the cities imposition in collection of fines ask and fees for criminal violations and Infractions and their impact.,155,,
833,0.97,4484.046,4493.355,"In 2017, we reached out to Dr. Harris, a local and national expert in researching and evaluating sanctions in the criminal legal system.",155,,
834,0.97,4493.355,4509.771,"Dr. Harris is the author of ""a pound of flesh, monetary sanctions as punishment for the poor ."" data was provided by Seattle municipal Court's research planning and evaluation group.",155,,
835,0.97,4509.771,4520.782,And we want to acknowledge the work that SMC did to support the process and the work of Dr. Harris and Dr. Edwards in creating the reported and throughout the process.,155,,
836,0.97,4520.782,4529.558,I'll pass it on to Dr. Harris and Dr. Edwards to present the report and their findings.,155,,
837,0.97,4529.558,4529.825,Great.,156,,
838,0.97,4529.825,4530.492,Thank you so much.,156,,
839,0.97,4530.626,4536.164,Thank you for inviting us to present the report.,157,,
840,0.97,4536.164,4540.636,"And thank you, Caedmon, for all of the support.",157,,
841,0.97,4540.636,4549.478,We'll jump in quickly and do a quick run through the findings and talk about a summary of the findings and talk about the policy implications.,157,,
842,0.97,4549.478,4558.053,So the research questions we set out to analyze were the extent and characteristics of unpaid debt related to Seattle municipal court.,157,,
843,0.97,4558.053,4564.326,Ask to look at the impact of the fines and fees on people who cannot afford them.,157,,
844,0.97,4564.326,4577.272,And we wanted to explore racial disparities in traffic and Nontraffic Infractions and a broader comparison of the city of Seattle legal profession with other cities in Washington state.,157,,
845,0.97,4577.272,4592.154,"Monetary sanctions, we are defining or treating them at all inclusive of all financial debt imposed by the court because of a charge or infraction.",157,,
846,0.97,4592.154,4597.492,We include here traffic Citationings and court fines and fees.,157,,
847,0.97,4597.492,4602.764,The data were cited or convicted cases between 2000 and 2017.,157,,
848,0.97,4602.764,4611.974,And Frank Edwards conducted the Aal Lis using our programming language.,157,,
849,0.97,4611.974,4623.485,And did comparisons to other jurisdictions using the data from the officer of the court and Lfo sentencing in municipalities between 2000 and 2014.,157,,
850,0.97,4623.485,4626.488,Frank will run us through the characteristics of the debt.,157,,
851,0.97,4626.622,4628.423,Thanks.,158,,
852,0.97,4628.423,4632.728,And appreciate you all having us here to share the findings today.,158,,
853,0.97,4632.728,4639.635,I'll start by talking through the changes over time in the case load of SMC.,158,,
854,0.97,4639.635,4649.311,"So we see here that cases have been Trending downward in terms of the volume of casings, the bottom plot, and the amount of cases per capita, the top plot.",158,,
855,0.97,4649.311,4665.127,"The overwhelming majority of the traffic Infractions in 2017, 83% of the Trafficment.",158,,
856,0.97,4665.127,4665.794,8% Nontraffic.,158,,
857,0.97,4665.794,4667.195,2% criminal traffic.,158,,
858,0.97,4667.195,4667.829,And 1% Duis.,158,,
859,0.97,4667.829,4672.934,"As the population increased, the trend line continued to go down.",158,,
860,0.97,4672.934,4673.235,Next slide.,158,,
861,0.97,4673.235,4679.374,"And here we look at--frequently after sentencing, the debt load is adjusted downward.",158,,
862,0.97,4679.374,4691.82,"Think about measuring the loads in terms of original order, the order after the court adjusted the total amount owed, and what was paid by the debtor.",158,,
863,0.97,4691.82,4696.324,For traffic Infractions the majority of the debt is for traffic Infrkss.,158,,
864,0.97,4696.324,4700.595,Half of the ordered amount was paid by the time of data collection.,158,,
865,0.97,4700.595,4705.233,And so we see a big adjustment downward on the infraction traffic.,158,,
866,0.97,4705.233,4713.241,"For the criminal Nontraffic and other Infractions, the adjusted amount dips.",158,,
867,0.97,4713.241,4717.879,Smc is adjusting the forms of debt downward typically.,158,,
868,0.97,4717.879,4722.417,For cases other than infraction traffic cases it's adjusted down quite a bit more.,158,,
869,0.97,4722.417,4723.485,"Next slide, please.",158,,
870,0.97,4723.485,4731.393,And here is the average amounted ordered adjusted and paid for various categories of Lfos in criminal traffic cases.,158,,
871,0.97,4731.393,4734.329,So the largest amount of adjustment comes on fines.,158,,
872,0.97,4734.329,4740.435,The initial--this is the average amount for a criminal traffic case.,158,,
873,0.97,4740.435,4744.573,And a huge downward adjustment in the initial amount of fines.,158,,
874,0.97,4744.573,4749.277,Lower reductions in the initial sentenced amount for other categories of Lfos.,158,,
875,0.97,4749.277,4752.314,Next slide.,158,,
876,0.97,4752.314,4755.283,Similar for criminal Nontraffic cases.,158,,
877,0.97,4755.283,4757.085,Dramatic reductions for the initial fine ordered.,158,,
878,0.97,4757.085,4766.027,But we see a smaller reduction in the initial order for other categories of Lfos.,158,,
879,0.97,4766.027,4772.901,And the amount that's collected from the adjusted order is typically a fraction of the adjusted amount.,158,,
880,0.97,4772.901,4779.207,"In most cases, by about 50%.",158,,
881,0.97,4779.207,4787.649,"Here's the average amounts ordered, adjusted, and paid for Nontraffic Infractons.",158,,
882,0.97,4787.649,4791.353,Much lower levels of reduction for these than in the criminal cases.,158,,
883,0.97,4791.353,4794.623,We see much lower levels of adjustment to the orders Infractions.,158,,
884,0.97,4794.623,4796.825,Next slide.,158,,
885,0.97,4796.825,4801.496,Similarly for traffic Infractions.,158,,
886,0.97,4801.496,4806.268,Both Nontraffic and traffic typically have lower levels of adjustment relative to the criminal cases.,158,,
887,0.97,4806.268,4817.078,"We see a higher initial order in the criminal cases, but much steeper reductions there the initial order amount where the traffic Infractions and Nontraffic are reduced by less.",158,,
888,0.97,4817.078,4820.615,And these are data current through 2017.,158,,
889,0.97,4820.615,4821.449,The recent changes in the Infractions.,158,,
890,0.97,4821.449,4821.817,Next slide.,158,,
891,0.97,4821.817,4827.155,Here we look at the age of accounts by closing date.,158,,
892,0.97,4827.155,4833.461,"We think about from the date of opening, how long did a case take to close?",158,,
893,0.97,4833.461,4837.265,"Unsurprisingly, the infraction cases closed far quicker than the criminal cases.",158,,
894,0.97,4837.265,4845.207,Criminal cases tended to remain open for quite some time with some cases remaining open for as long as ten years.,158,,
895,0.97,4845.207,4848.41,Infraction cases had a relatively short age.,158,,
896,0.97,4848.41,4856.785,"Next, we'll look at inequalities in SMC debt by race and Ethnicity in Seattle.",158,,
897,0.97,4856.785,4870.432,"Here, we look at the number of cases with monetary sanction Stengsed as a function of the size of Seattle's population for race and Ethnicity for 2017.",158,,
898,0.97,4870.432,4874.169,The pink bar is the total population.,158,,
899,0.97,4874.169,4881.943,"The yellow, greenish bar represents the American Indian and Alaska native.",158,,
900,0.97,4881.943,4883.211,Blue for black.,158,,
901,0.97,4883.211,4885.647,The purple for Latin X populations.,158,,
902,0.97,4885.647,4887.515,And the magenta for white.,158,,
903,0.97,4887.515,4893.355,"Across the board, per capita, black residents in Seattle are sentenced to Lfos at higher rates.",158,,
904,0.97,4893.355,4897.225,"This is how many cases per 1,000 people are there.",158,,
905,0.97,4897.225,4904.933,In the city and black people have far higher levels of debt holding from SMC than other groups.,158,,
906,0.97,4904.933,4913.775,American Indians and Alaska natives have high levels of debt burden for Nontraffic infraction cases.,158,,
907,0.97,4913.775,4924.786,And this is kind of interesting function of how the court is handling the cases.,158,,
908,0.97,4924.786,4932.594,"When we look at sentencing, we don't see dramatic differences in terms of the initial orders and adjusted amounts across groups.",158,,
909,0.97,4932.594,4939.567,What this suggests is what is driving the disparities in the court is the front door.,158,,
910,0.97,4939.567,4948.209,It's enforcement decisions by the SPD and other agencies in terms of who comes in contact with the court.,158,,
911,0.97,4948.209,4953.014,"Once in the court, largely equitable sentencing by case type.",158,,
912,0.97,4953.014,4970.532,"And if we convert this into a ratio of debt, so we'll take the total debt load, divide those by the size of the population of the city of Seattle, we see racial inequalities.",158,,
913,0.97,4970.532,4982.978,"So the debt load for black Seattle residents, for example, driving with a license suspended in third degree is six times higher than for white Seattle residents.",158,,
914,0.97,4982.978,4994.889,"We see the inequalities across the board for all categories of violations that SMC handles, we have higher levels of debt load for the black residents than for the White residents.",158,,
915,0.97,4994.889,5007.235,Higher levels of debt load for Dws3 cases for American Indians and Alaska natives as well.,158,,
916,0.97,5007.235,5015.643,"Next, we turn to thinking about the long-term consequences of potential debt holdings.",158,,
917,0.97,5015.643,5029.858,We merged the data to the data on the office of the courts to match people sentenced to debt through the SMC to records for Superior Court sentencing to see who was incarcerated through the court sentence.,158,,
918,0.97,5029.858,5037.365,"Here, the left column is women's probability of being incarcerated after paid or unpaid traffic infraction.",158,,
919,0.97,5037.365,5043.238,And we set those to be $175 arbitrarily based on a regression prediction.,158,,
920,0.97,5043.238,5044.973,"In the right, we have net.",158,,
921,0.97,5044.973,5052.947,The basic question is what proportion of Debters were sentenced to Incarceration through a superior court after the Seattle municipal court.,158,,
922,0.97,5052.947,5063.558,"This isn't saying this is a cause of the debt, it's asking the proportion of the people who owed debt later ended up incarcerated.",158,,
923,0.97,5063.558,5071.633,"For traffic Infrashgss, black men in Seattle with a traffic infraction paid in full had a 3.2%.",158,,
924,0.97,5071.633,5082.11,And black men with unpaid Infractions had a 10.3% who were incarcerated with unpaid traffic Infractions.,158,,
925,0.97,5082.11,5095.09,"For criminal Nontraffic, if it was paid in full for black men, 3.9% for later Incarceration.",158,,
926,0.97,5095.09,5100.562,"And criminal Nontraffic cases, 25.7% rate of later Incarceration.",158,,
927,0.97,5100.562,5105.266,Much higher levels for black men than for white men.,158,,
928,0.97,5105.266,5118.58,"Next, so the Dwl in the third degree is a key vector through which the low level sanctions can turn into criminal charges.",158,,
929,0.97,5118.58,5121.749,The unpaid tickets can lead to license suspension.,158,,
930,0.97,5121.749,5124.752,"If you are pulled over and Ticketed, that is a criminal offense.",158,,
931,0.97,5124.752,5133.461,So we have about 2.3% similar analysis to the last one based on predictions.,158,,
932,0.97,5133.461,5144.973,"And 2.3% of black men who receive traffic Infractions can expect to be charged with at some point, compared to 0.4% of white men.",158,,
933,0.97,5144.973,5154.616,And Latin and native American are more likely to be charged with it following an Lfo.,158,,
934,0.97,5154.616,5156.184,0.8% of Latin men.,158,,
935,0.97,5156.184,5166.327,This is one of the key vectors through which the low levels contacts with the court can turn into criminal contacts with the court based on inability to pay.,158,,
936,0.97,5166.327,5169.531,And we'll compare Seattle to other Jurisdictionings in the state.,158,,
937,0.97,5169.531,5178.439,"And here, we have the map, these plots grouped into types of cities in Seattle by population size.",158,,
938,0.97,5178.439,5184.345,"So the top left corner is cities with population less than 10,000.",158,,
939,0.97,5184.345,5187.348,And the bottom right corner is Seattle.,158,,
940,0.97,5187.348,5193.388,"The cities on the left, those are the cities with the population.",158,,
941,0.97,5193.388,5206.901,"And here, what we're doing is comparing the adjusted debt, that's after the court adjusted it for municipal courts across types of city by population size in the state to get a sense of variation.",158,,
942,0.97,5206.901,5219.38,"And Seattle is far lower in terms of the adjusted debt load held by the residents than other cities in the state, with the exception of traffic Infractions.",158,,
943,0.97,5219.38,5232.827,"For Seattle, they are similar to levels of traffic infraction for other parts of the state, with the exception of an upward trend in other parts of the state being obvious for the mid sized and small cities.",158,,
944,0.97,5232.827,5236.965,Seattle is ordering lower levels of debt for the Superior Court than others.,158,,
945,0.97,5237.265,5246.608,"And here we look at the cases per 1,000 by type by 2014.",158,,
946,0.97,5246.608,5250.178,This is the latest year we have the comparable information.,158,,
947,0.97,5250.178,5257.085,We can think of this as the cases out there relative to the population size.,158,,
948,0.97,5257.085,5263.758,Seattle is in the same range as other jurisdictions for traffic Infractions and Nontraffic Infractions.,158,,
949,0.97,5263.758,5268.963,"We see far lower cases per 1,000 for criminal cases than we do in other courts.",158,,
950,0.97,5268.963,5271.599,Next slide.,158,,
951,0.97,5271.599,5274.535,And here we look at sentencing.,158,,
952,0.97,5274.535,5290.451,What is the average Lfo sentenced to an individual who came through SMC relative to other courts for various classes offenses to get an apples to apples comparison of the debt ordered across the different courses.,158,,
953,0.97,5290.451,5290.785,My apologies.,158,,
954,0.97,5290.785,5293.554,Knocking my white board over.,158,,
955,0.97,5293.554,5298.526,"And traffic Infractions, Seattle is similar to others.",158,,
956,0.97,5298.526,5299.627,"And Nontraffic, slightly lower.",158,,
957,0.97,5299.627,5305.166,We see large differences on Dui orders and criminal Nontraffic orders.,158,,
958,0.97,5305.166,5314.776,Seattle is ordering far lower debt after adjustment on criminal Nontraffic and Dui cases than other jurisdictions.,158,,
959,0.97,5314.776,5321.249,Criminal traffic and Infractions traffic appear relatively smaller.,158,,
960,0.97,5321.249,5321.549,Next slide.,158,,
961,0.97,5321.549,5324.085,Frank did a master class on that.,159,,
962,0.97,5324.085,5324.385,Thank you.,159,,
963,0.97,5324.385,5325.687,We have five main points.,159,,
964,0.97,5325.687,5334.729,One is that there's been a remarkable decline in cases into 2000 and 2017.,159,,
965,0.97,5334.729,5341.402,"Second, people sentenced to criminal traffic cases had accounts open for longer periods of time compared to other types of cases.",159,,
966,0.97,5341.402,5356.818,"For each class of case, black men and women are significantly more likely than their peers to be sentenced to Incarceration through Washington state superior courts following a paid Seattle municipal court Lfo.",159,,
967,0.97,5356.818,5369.597,"And for each class of case, black men and women are more likely to be sentenced to Incarceration through Washington Superior Court following an unpaid SMC.",159,,
968,0.97,5369.597,5378.84,"And fifth, people of color have a higher likelihood of white person to be charged following a sentence.",159,,
969,0.97,5378.84,5381.175,This is pronounced for black drivers in Seattle.,159,,
970,0.97,5381.175,5389.584,And we have several policy recommendations that sort of attach on to what judge Gregory outlined.,159,,
971,0.97,5389.584,5396.324,The judges should continue to assess the individual's ability to pay in all circumstances.,159,,
972,0.97,5396.324,5402.83,We suggest that judges weigh the discretionary costs when people have little to no current ability to pay.,159,,
973,0.97,5402.83,5415.143,"Policies at the state and local government should Interrogate the necessity for add on personalities for interest, default penalties, deferring fees.",159,,
974,0.97,5415.143,5419.547,And state policy should Decouple the nonpayment from criminal manners and the suspension of driver's license.,159,,
975,0.97,5419.547,5423.417,This is key and happening nationally at this moment.,159,,
976,0.97,5423.417,5429.09,And state and local jurisdictions should conduct regular monitoring and analysis of the sentencing and collections.,159,,
977,0.97,5429.09,5435.096,I just wanted to sort of address really quickly judge Gregory's policies.,159,,
978,0.97,5435.096,5436.297,"They're very, very powerful.",159,,
979,0.97,5436.297,5438.199,But there's two important Caveats to recognize.,159,,
980,0.97,5438.199,5443.838,One is that there's a mandatory $250Vpa for a misdemeanor.,159,,
981,0.97,5443.838,5447.108,Only that can be addressed by the state changing those.,159,,
982,0.97,5447.108,5455.883,And so that's still a key barrier.,159,,
983,0.97,5455.883,5466.627,"And also as Frank illustrated, it appears that SMC judges are addressing the inability to pay and lowering initial sentencing amounts.",159,,
984,0.97,5466.627,5472.466,But what we're seeing here is what's happening in the community with police citation around traffic.,159,,
985,0.97,5472.466,5474.936,And that needs to be addressed.,159,,
986,0.97,5474.936,5488.916,There needs to be a conversation with SMC and SPD with how the citations are being distributed and giving disproportionately to black drivers in Seattle.,159,,
987,0.97,5489.05,5501.729,Thank you both Dr. Harris and Dr. Edwards for that concise and thorough presentation.,160,,
988,0.97,5501.729,5533.06,Can you speak to the follow-up as it relates to what appears to be a necessary convening of state courts and Legislature late Tors as it relates to some of the findings that this report makes around Dwls3.,160,,
989,0.97,5533.06,5540.835,And just generally around required fines that local governments can't waive because of state law?,160,,
990,0.97,5540.968,5544.438,Right.,161,,
991,0.97,5544.438,5564.825,"In 2018, Washington state Legislature passed 17A3 which did dramatically alter the landscape of Lfos and gave judges the discretion that they could not impose Nonmandatory fines and fears to people deemed indigent.",161,,
992,0.97,5564.825,5565.626,That was crucial.,161,,
993,0.97,5565.626,5580.808,"But I think given the data and the disparities, those same type of standards should be applied to the mandatory $250 for a misdemeanor and $500 for a felony.",161,,
994,0.97,5580.808,5584.445,Either it applies and judges will have discretion with the costs.,161,,
995,0.97,5584.445,5586.781,Or the Legislature do away with calling them mandatory in total.,161,,
996,0.97,5586.781,5597.224,And further discussions around decoupling any nonpayment of court imposed fines and fees with the loss of a driver's license.,161,,
997,0.97,5597.224,5604.832,It makes absolutely no sense for people to lose their driver's licenses when they need to get to work to pay the fines and fees.,161,,
998,0.97,5604.832,5613.741,That's evidence across the nation with how the legislatures are amending the statues.,161,,
999,0.97,5613.741,5618.679,And the follow-up question to Caedmon Cahill.,162,,
1000,0.97,5618.679,5629.357,Is this an issue that we have flagged for the office of Inter-Government relations for our upcoming legislative,162,,
1001,0.97,5629.357,5630.224,We have not yet.,163,,
1002,0.97,5630.224,5632.259,Can I suggest that we do so?,164,,
1003,0.97,5632.259,5632.393,.,164,,
1004,0.97,5632.393,5632.793,Yes.,165,,
1005,0.97,5632.927,5644.805,And I would be very happy to participate in any way that would be useful.,166,,
1006,0.97,5644.805,5652.146,And maybe work to do some follow-up to the report.,166,,
1007,0.97,5652.146,5652.78,Maybe joined by the court.,166,,
1008,0.97,5652.78,5689.617,And ask for their leadership to help maybe convene some sort of a round table to talk about continuing some of our best practices that we have in Seattle throughout the state at local government and the also making the necessary changes to further drive down these high debt ratios by communities resulting from our criminal justice system.,166,,
1009,0.97,5689.617,5696.323,"Councilmembers, does anybody have any--Councilmember Morales.",166,,
1010,0.97,5696.323,5696.59,Thank you.,166,,
1011,0.97,5696.724,5697.024,Thank you.,167,,
1012,0.97,5697.024,5699.96,"Good morning, everyone.",167,,
1013,0.97,5699.96,5700.561,Thank you for this report.,167,,
1014,0.97,5700.561,5719.814,"I'm going to ask--well, maybe I don't need to ask you to go back to the data charts, but I want to talk about the issue of the front door that you mentioned that's a contributor to the problem here.",167,,
1015,0.97,5719.814,5724.585,I'm interested particularly in understanding again the frequency of citations for black drivers.,167,,
1016,0.97,5724.585,5742.002,"And, I mean, it leads me to the next question, which is how many of those encounters don't end with a citation, but end in, you know, a much more dramatic and harrowing experience.",167,,
1017,0.97,5742.002,5763.09,"And so I guess part of my question is also do you have suggestions, Dr. Harris, you mentioned talking with SPD about why is it there is a clear Disproportion about who they cite?",167,,
1018,0.97,5763.09,5777.104,"And do you have suggestions about what kind of--is that a policy change, is that a conversation with SPD about the practice and how we address this problem which is creating problems for our community.",167,,
1019,0.97,5777.104,5777.371,Right.,168,,
1020,0.97,5777.371,5795.956,"Appears from the analysis that policing in the community leads, if you will, a Gateway drug for people to get in the criminal justice system and jail and Incarceration and long-term debt.",168,,
1021,0.97,5795.956,5800.594,Frank has done a national analysis on police stops and outcomes.,168,,
1022,0.97,5800.594,5801.195,I'll let him address that.,168,,
1023,0.97,5801.195,5804.732,There's a lot of good questions here.,169,,
1024,0.97,5804.732,5817.645,And I think the evidence for SMC is relatively clear that the inequities we're seeing is not a function of Court decision making necessarily in terms of the sentence.,169,,
1025,0.97,5817.645,5822.817,It's the hits by SPD and other enforcement.,169,,
1026,0.97,5822.817,5826.487,"That said, debt loads are felt unevenly.",169,,
1027,0.97,5826.487,5832.526,A $250 debt to one person feels differently than to another person.,169,,
1028,0.97,5832.526,5838.299,"Despite the fact it's equitable sentencing, it's still Inequitablout comes.",169,,
1029,0.97,5838.299,5840.868,There are processing points to think about.,169,,
1030,0.97,5840.868,5847.641,But they are good questions in terms of police contact and citations.,169,,
1031,0.97,5847.641,5850.511,"Unfortunately, we don't have great data on these things.",169,,
1032,0.97,5850.511,5856.283,"Spd, we would be happy to have conversations about the kinds of data we would need to conduct that.",169,,
1033,0.97,5856.283,5876.837,"And Offen times, when a stop occurs where a citation isn't issued, we don't have the information on it as researchers N. the cases where the police are seeing someone and choosing not to have an interaction or not registering a citation, we don't see those.",169,,
1034,0.97,5876.837,5880.074,This is a known problem in policing.,169,,
1035,0.97,5880.074,5886.513,So there's big complicated questions in terms of how we accurately measure the bias in policing.,169,,
1036,0.97,5886.513,5890.317,This data is showing there is clearly a bias in Seattle.,169,,
1037,0.97,5890.317,5892.253,Frank is being humble.,170,,
1038,0.97,5892.253,5900.828,He recently had a paper published that looks at National data on mortality and police encounters.,170,,
1039,0.97,5900.828,5904.331,You want to summarize that?,170,,
1040,0.97,5904.331,5904.598,Sure.,171,,
1041,0.97,5904.598,5917.678,"Along with my colleagues, we published a paper that showed that black and indigenous black men and women are at a higher risk of being killed by the police than their peers.",171,,
1042,0.97,5917.678,5924.685,This is a clear function of racial inequality across the country and there's sub national regional patterns.,171,,
1043,0.97,5924.685,5934.295,The West Coast in particular has higher levels of police violence toward black people than other Partsover the country.,171,,
1044,0.97,5934.295,5951.111,The data problem with thinking about Lfos and fines and fees is a larger data problem that also applies to thinking about use of force and thinking about encounter rates and thinking about ways that we could reduce levels of abuse of force.,171,,
1045,0.97,5951.111,5961.355,"And I think broadly, considerations to think about reducing police civilian reaction.",171,,
1046,0.97,5961.355,5979.506,And broadly thinking in terms of ways to limit the interaction of the police with the community both through routine traffic enforcement and other kinds of enforcement activities would have clear effects on debt load and have likely effects on levels of police civilian violence.,171,,
1047,0.97,5979.506,5995.589,So the citations ability of police to give the citations and over surveillance in plaque and Brown community lead to the contacts.,172,,
1048,0.97,5995.589,6001.428,And the warrants contacted to inability to pay that are given to people set off the Uncounters as well.,172,,
1049,0.97,6001.428,6003.13,Do you have a follow-up?,173,,
1050,0.97,6003.13,6003.263,.,173,,
1051,0.97,6003.263,6004.131,Yes.,174,,
1052,0.97,6004.131,6004.398,Thank you.,174,,
1053,0.97,6004.398,6005.232,Thank you for the information.,174,,
1054,0.97,6005.232,6013.006,I am going to bet you $10 that the city council does not have a subscription to the Journal.,174,,
1055,0.97,6013.006,6018.278,Is it possible for us to get a copy of this paper?,174,,
1056,0.97,6018.278,6018.579,Thank you.,174,,
1057,0.97,6018.579,6021.148,.,174,,
1058,0.97,6021.148,6038.165,And I would appreciate a follow-up conversation around the data piece that you Referenced and whether or not there's a way that we can work with the police Department to get more of that information.,175,,
1059,0.97,6038.165,6052.012,That would be helpful to both analysis and policy reform efforts that we could work together on with the police Department.,175,,
1060,0.97,6052.012,6056.116,"I think that would be a really positive, forward step.",175,,
1061,0.97,6056.116,6063.957,And I am interested in seeing what the city and the court can do about spearheading this conversation as well.,175,,
1062,0.97,6063.957,6074.802,"If there are no further questions, I want to thank you guys for providing a very concise report.",175,,
1063,0.97,6074.802,6076.203,You covered a lot of ground.,175,,
1064,0.97,6076.203,6076.837,I really appreciate it.,175,,
1065,0.97,6076.837,6081.408,And we'll--it's great to see everybody.,175,,
1066,0.97,6081.408,6089.716,And we'll move on to the next item on the agenda:.,175,,
1067,0.97,6089.716,6091.585,Item number five.,176,,
1068,0.97,6091.585,6094.788,Community service officer program Impmentation.,176,,
1069,0.97,6094.788,6095.456,Fantastic.,177,,
1070,0.97,6095.456,6095.722,Thank you.,177,,
1071,0.97,6095.722,6096.09,All right.,177,,
1072,0.97,6096.09,6105.132,Shifting other to the Seattle police Department's community service officer program Everyonementation.,177,,
1073,0.97,6105.132,6106.1,We'll hear from the assistant Chooef Hirjak.,177,,
1074,0.97,6106.1,6128.789,"And this is just as a quick bit of background, in the 2017 budget process, enacted by the Council in 2016, I among other Councilmembers cosponsored a proposal to bring back the community service officer program that had been in operation for 33 years.",177,,
1075,0.97,6128.789,6134.094,Until 2004 which it was eliminated due to budget cuts.,177,,
1076,0.97,6134.094,6144.304,It was great to have the opportunity to cosponsor the Legislature with the 2016 vote.,177,,
1077,0.97,6144.304,6166.994,And I am really excited of the Department's use of Unsworn officers to Prioritize the response to Nonemergency services associated with law enforcement needs to free up the police officers to better respond to 911 calls.,177,,
1078,0.97,6166.994,6182.809,"They can as with mediating disputes, follow-up calls for Nonemergency services, help the residents navigate the services and support programming for at risk youth and attending Community-Hosted events.",177,,
1079,0.97,6182.809,6186.88,And helping to Mediate civil issues such as landlord and tenant issues.,177,,
1080,0.97,6186.88,6197.391,"Last year, the police Department announced the plan to enact the Council's 2016 legislation and relaunch the community service officer program.",177,,
1081,0.97,6197.391,6208.435,"When that happened, the Council adopted a statement of legislative intent requesting an update.",177,,
1082,0.97,6208.435,6220.414,And we're here to get that Impmentation update.,177,,
1083,0.97,6220.414,6223.05,I'm really happy to have SPD present.,177,,
1084,0.97,6223.05,6225.319,Apologies for not doing so earlier if the year.,177,,
1085,0.97,6225.319,6231.592,"Like many things, it was delayed due to the pandemic and the need to Revisit the 2020 budget.",177,,
1086,0.97,6231.592,6240.367,And I'm really glad to have assistant chief Hirjak here with us today to present this long-awaited report.,177,,
1087,0.97,6240.367,6244.805,"So with that, I'll pass it over to assistant chief Hirjak.",177,,
1088,0.97,6244.938,6251.545,"Thank you, chairwoman her bold.",178,,
1089,0.97,6251.545,6252.479,"Good morning, everyone.",178,,
1090,0.97,6252.479,6267.294,"I want to thank as well as Councilmember her bold, the other committee members here for having me here to discuss the status of the community service officer program, more commonly known as the CSO program.",178,,
1091,0.97,6267.294,6267.928,I'm Steve Hirjak.,178,,
1092,0.97,6267.928,6279.706,"As Councilmember her bold let you know, I'm the assistant chief of police for the collaborative policing Bureau.",178,,
1093,0.97,6279.706,6282.409,The unit falls under my Bureau of policing.,178,,
1094,0.97,6282.409,6292.219,I want to thank the committee as well as the prior incarnation of the committee along with the Council for the support of the CSO program.,178,,
1095,0.97,6292.219,6296.423,I came on SPD in 1993.,178,,
1096,0.97,6296.423,6311.338,"So as someone who has served the city for 27 years, I fondly remember the assistance of the former Csos and a couple of friendships with those who formerly served the Csos for the city.",178,,
1097,0.97,6311.338,6337.764,"But the assistance the former Csos supplied to the city and the Department back then as a brand new patrol officer, I was very appreciative of the CSO's assistance with such things as landlord and tenant disputes, training, Assistanting the police calls involving child protective services, and numerous other types of interactions in which they proved invaluable in asking as a patrol officer.",178,,
1098,0.97,6337.764,6340.367,"Having said that, times have changed.",178,,
1099,0.97,6340.367,6342.169,And what we need them for has changed as well.,178,,
1100,0.97,6342.169,6351.812,But the need for them as a resource has not.,178,,
1101,0.97,6351.812,6354.114,Thank for bringing them back.,178,,
1102,0.97,6354.114,6364.891,"As Councilmember her bold mentioned, Ging in 2017, we worked with the office of civil rights to conduct a racial equity analysis and extensive community engagement.",178,,
1103,0.97,6364.891,6372.132,And Reheard clearly from almost every corner of the community what people hope for in the new CSO program.,178,,
1104,0.97,6372.132,6387.647,"So before I make myself available for questions to the Council here, I wanted to make sure that some common questions or an FAQ was addressed on the front end.",178,,
1105,0.97,6387.647,6396.423,The Csos report to two civilian supervisors and one SPD Sergeant.,178,,
1106,0.97,6396.423,6401.094,"We currently have 12Csos, not counting the supervisors.",178,,
1107,0.97,6401.094,6404.765,They wear a soft uniform.,178,,
1108,0.97,6404.765,6411.171,This is basically a Polo shirt in baby blue to differentiate them from sworn police officers.,178,,
1109,0.97,6411.171,6422.582,"We want to make sure to the public it's clear they're not approaching a sworn police officer, but rather a community service officer.",178,,
1110,0.97,6422.582,6438.064,"The uniform choice of a Polo shirt is also--it's very approachable as opposed to, you know, more formalized military style or para military style uniform.",178,,
1111,0.97,6438.064,6441.134,"We had over 1,000 applicants for the program.",178,,
1112,0.97,6441.134,6445.305,And we hired these applicants from a very diverse pool.,178,,
1113,0.97,6445.305,6449.109,And I'm very pleased with the group of personnel we have hired.,178,,
1114,0.97,6449.109,6460.12,"Unfortunately, Covid has impacted our ability to completely fill the program.",178,,
1115,0.97,6460.12,6468.762,We have three vacancies caused by the hiring freeze when Covid struck us with the hiring freeze earlier this year.,178,,
1116,0.97,6468.762,6474.601,So they officially began work or employment on April 15th of this year.,178,,
1117,0.97,6474.601,6496.022,"Before going out in public, they received extensive training in things such as social work, Deescalation, conflict resolution, conflict mediation, crisis intervention, classes on institutional racism and cultural competency.",178,,
1118,0.97,6496.022,6501.761,"We submitted a report, I believe last week to the Council that has more comprehensive list of the training.",178,,
1119,0.97,6501.761,6504.731,It was an extensive list of the training.,178,,
1120,0.97,6504.731,6514.374,"Unfortunately, Covid has interfered with a few of those points that we wanted to have due to restrictions on In-Person group training.",178,,
1121,0.97,6514.374,6516.71,So that's something we're trying to work on and be flexible with.,178,,
1122,0.97,6516.71,6524.317,"In the meantime, we want to get value out of the program.",178,,
1123,0.97,6524.317,6536.963,So they have been serving the city out in public on foot or in vehicles going out and the majority of the time is spent out of the vehicle where they can interact with members of the public.,178,,
1124,0.97,6536.963,6550.911,"So they have ongoing projects they are working on, as well as being dispatched by the 911 system to be sent to radio calls.",178,,
1125,0.97,6550.911,6556.85,Or sometimes they receive direct calls straight to their office to as with community problems.,178,,
1126,0.97,6556.85,6568.561,They have been working very closely with our civilian crime prevention Coordinators to help implement crime prevention strategies and information sharing.,178,,
1127,0.97,6568.561,6581.207,"One of the points that when I spoke to the supervisors about some of the progress they have made, they have a training in crime prevention for environmental design.",178,,
1128,0.97,6581.207,6594.02,"For example, they would go out and talk the a grocery store owner with a high level of theft or calls for service and kind of get eyes on and build the community engagement and trust.",178,,
1129,0.97,6594.02,6598.925,That's one of the primary goals of the community service officer program.,178,,
1130,0.97,6598.925,6603.063,Establish what they perceive as patterns based on their training.,178,,
1131,0.97,6603.063,6619.679,"And connect the, say, business owner or neighborhood group leader with our crime prevention coordinator in order to get a more robust crime prevention for environmental design assessment.",178,,
1132,0.97,6619.679,6625.218,So we see integration and synergy in the way we deploy the Csos.,178,,
1133,0.97,6625.218,6628.888,"Currently, she staff two shifts from 7:00 in the morning until 8:00 at night.",178,,
1134,0.97,6628.888,6638.498,The coverage has been expanded to seven days a week with the event Impmentation of shifts.,178,,
1135,0.97,6638.498,6642.435,We had previously notified you we would do six days a week.,178,,
1136,0.97,6642.435,6646.973,I need to notify the Council we are employing seven days a week now.,178,,
1137,0.97,6646.973,6647.907,They do not work holidays.,178,,
1138,0.97,6647.907,6653.313,They are currently working out of the SPD headquarters on the fifth floor.,178,,
1139,0.97,6653.313,6656.816,They have three primary categories of work that they're working on.,178,,
1140,0.97,6656.816,6664.858,That being resource connection and guidance for members of the public.,178,,
1141,0.97,6664.858,6666.493,Youth diversion and youth services.,178,,
1142,0.97,6666.493,6667.327,And community engagement and education.,178,,
1143,0.97,6667.327,6679.339,"As I mentioned previously, the Covid-19 pandemic, as it has with everything, impacted the planned deployment.",178,,
1144,0.97,6679.339,6681.341,15 of the planned 18 were hired.,178,,
1145,0.97,6681.341,6684.811,But we couldn't fill out the remaining spots.,178,,
1146,0.97,6684.811,6693.019,"Currently, we plan to leave those positions unfilled due to the hiring freeze and the budget concerns at the moment.",178,,
1147,0.97,6693.019,6701.528,"Additionally, the Covid pandemic has also impacted some of the delivery of some of our supplies.",178,,
1148,0.97,6701.528,6708.201,"There was impacts to some of, for example, the uniforms or delayed delivery of the vehicles.",178,,
1149,0.97,6708.201,6712.372,The Ford factory slowed down production of the vehicles.,178,,
1150,0.97,6712.372,6714.974,There have been completely unexpected impacts from the pandemic.,178,,
1151,0.97,6714.974,6718.945,We could not initially completely all of the training.,178,,
1152,0.97,6718.945,6722.382,So the name of the game currently is to be Adaptive.,178,,
1153,0.97,6722.382,6737.564,We're currently working with the employees who have proven to be exceptionally adaptable and flexible with trying to find current value before we can get through the pandemic and see the results of Redeploying the resource from history.,178,,
1154,0.97,6737.564,6757.517,"Currently, some of the things that they have done is they found through community meetings that there was a great logistics problem where the food banks getting food to some of the most vulnerable members with the shutdown and people ordered to stay at home.",178,,
1155,0.97,6757.517,6767.794,"And some of the transit services became fear Pointeds for people not wanting to expose themselves to Covid-19 on, say, public transit such as buses.",178,,
1156,0.97,6767.794,6775.201,So the CSO saw an opportunity to as the food banks with delivering food weekly.,178,,
1157,0.97,6775.201,6782.809,They check in to see the need and if there's any high need areas where they can get the food out.,178,,
1158,0.97,6782.809,6787.847,They have been doing that weekly since they have been of the street asking with that.,178,,
1159,0.97,6787.847,6792.452,And they have been working heavily in community engagement.,178,,
1160,0.97,6792.452,6806.032,"They go out on Friday nights and engage members of the community with the drive Byes for the social engagement, emphasizing places such as nursing homes or places where people have less mobility to get out and have social interaction.",178,,
1161,0.97,6806.032,6818.511,I know that they have made numerous contacts in city parks trying to both engage the community and get feedback.,178,,
1162,0.97,6818.511,6821.848,But also reminding people of social distancing.,178,,
1163,0.97,6821.848,6832.792,"And in many cases, the numbers are at least 80 members of the public that they provide masks to to as with the social distancing guidelines.",178,,
1164,0.97,6832.792,6836.162,They have attended virtual meetings.,178,,
1165,0.97,6836.162,6843.303,"For example, I believe they have met with the C.I.D.",178,,
1166,0.97,6843.303,6847.54,Virtual zoom meeting to get public engagement from the police Department.,178,,
1167,0.97,6847.54,6857.55,They have provided transport for people in vulnerable situations such as traffic accident with a disabled vehicle where a family couldn't get home.,178,,
1168,0.97,6857.55,6866.859,They have proven invaluable in that rather than having an officer with a marked patrol car and a prisoner compartment transport someone home.,178,,
1169,0.97,6866.859,6878.538,"So moving forward, I know that chief Diaz and I both see the Csos as an important part in Reenvisioning policing.",178,,
1170,0.97,6878.538,6893.186,"To that end, the Csos have provided handouts and links to the Remaejen police survey and getting the public to increase the participation in the Seattle University public safety survey.",178,,
1171,0.97,6893.186,6899.025,"So I at this point, that's really what I have for you.",178,,
1172,0.97,6899.025,6900.86,And I could be available for questions now.,178,,
1173,0.97,6900.994,6904.53,Thank you so much.,179,,
1174,0.97,6904.53,6907.967,I really appreciate this overview.,179,,
1175,0.97,6907.967,6912.972,Quick question while my colleagues on the Councilare determining whether or not they have questions.,179,,
1176,0.97,6912.972,6938.298,One of the items that has been a high priority for me as it relates to the Reestablishment of the CSO program relates to the Seattle municipal code prohibition against land Lord lockouts outside of a court order or utility Shutoffs.,179,,
1177,0.97,6938.298,6949.208,"And for many years, there's been sort after many years--as long as I have been at City Hall and before that at the Tenant'Sup I don't know.",179,,
1178,0.97,6949.208,6957.717,There's been a Volleying back and forth between the code enforcement Department.,179,,
1179,0.97,6957.717,6959.752,Many over the last 25 years.,179,,
1180,0.97,6959.752,6966.426,And the police Department over who enforces that prohibition against lockouts and utility Shutoffs.,179,,
1181,0.97,6966.426,6973.333,The code enforcement office has done it on occasion.,179,,
1182,0.97,6973.333,6983.543,"And frankly, the time when in my opinion it functioned best was when we were able to refer these to Csos when the old CSO program was up and running.",179,,
1183,0.97,6983.543,7004.931,"I just want to confirm, and we don't have to do it now, but I want to confirm there's a clear line for tenants or tenant advocacy organizations who are aware of unlawful Lockous or utility Shutoffs to the Csos to be able to respond to a civil issue such as that.",179,,
1184,0.97,7004.931,7014.807,.,179,,
1185,0.97,7014.807,7019.879,I was speaking historically.,180,,
1186,0.97,7019.879,7026.552,"However, that's not currently implemented because of the Covid impacts of getting this up and running and up to speed.",180,,
1187,0.97,7026.552,7032.592,That's definitely something that is up for discussion but is currently not implemented.,180,,
1188,0.97,7032.592,7037.597,"Again, high priority for me and the Council when we provided the funding.",181,,
1189,0.97,7037.597,7044.57,I think this function was called out in our budget action as a high priority.,181,,
1190,0.97,7044.57,7045.471,For the Csos.,181,,
1191,0.97,7045.471,7050.276,Look forward to talking to you more about that.,181,,
1192,0.97,7050.276,7053.012,"And Council colleagues, does anybody else have any questions?",181,,
1193,0.97,7053.012,7056.883,Okay.,181,,
1194,0.97,7056.883,7059.485,I have one more question.,181,,
1195,0.97,7059.485,7067.794,Can you just talk a little bit about the geographic deployment of Csos?,181,,
1196,0.97,7067.794,7082.308,There was some talk prior to Impmentation of the program of whether or not this was going to be a central deployment or a by precinct deployment.,181,,
1197,0.97,7082.308,7094.787,"My understanding is though the Csos are centrally located at the Seattle justice center, they are evenly deployed to the precincts throughout the city.",181,,
1198,0.97,7094.787,7098.458,Is that more or less correct?,181,,
1199,0.97,7098.591,7104.33,They are centralized.,182,,
1200,0.97,7104.33,7105.364,That part is correct.,182,,
1201,0.97,7105.364,7114.774,We wanted to remain flexible in their ability to respond to areas of need.,182,,
1202,0.97,7114.774,7117.61,So they're currently not limited by geography.,182,,
1203,0.97,7117.61,7124.684,"For example, assigned permanently to a North precinct or a Southwest precinct.",182,,
1204,0.97,7124.684,7144.103,But they are liaisons with the precincts to find out what the issues are and attempting to as them and find opportunities to as with gaps with the patrol resources with each of the precincts.,182,,
1205,0.97,7144.103,7160.586,"If we knew there was going to be something big at al Kie, we maintain the flexibility by being centralized to deploy the resources toward something going on or acute at the time.",182,,
1206,0.97,7160.586,7161.854,Thank you.,183,,
1207,0.97,7161.854,7162.388,Councilmember Morales.,184,,
1208,0.97,7162.388,7164.524,Thank you.,185,,
1209,0.97,7164.524,7164.857,Good morning.,185,,
1210,0.97,7164.857,7169.829,I have a question.,185,,
1211,0.97,7169.829,7190.616,Part of the report response discusses the kind of routine patrols that the Csos go through in community and specifically talks about having conversations with businesses that are expressing their concern about crime in the area and how to report crime.,185,,
1212,0.97,7190.616,7207.433,"Can you just walk us through--I'm trying to understand what the process is for our neighbors, particularly these kind of neighborhood business districts, to report when something is happening.",185,,
1213,0.97,7207.433,7219.412,"If they're speaking with a community resource officer first, what is the Handoff, maybe, to another officer, and what is the process they can expect for follow through?",185,,
1214,0.97,7219.412,7245.471,"And I'm asking because I have had conversations with constituents throughout my district in China town International district, the Mount Baker, light rail area, in Ranier Beach calling to ask for support.",185,,
1215,0.97,7245.471,7249.675,"There's car break INS, shootings happening.",185,,
1216,0.97,7249.675,7254.647,Some of this is not something there can be an immediate response to.,185,,
1217,0.97,7254.647,7256.215,I just want to understand.,185,,
1218,0.97,7256.215,7260.92,They're not getting far with getting assistance and understanding what's happening in the community and how to resolve it.,185,,
1219,0.97,7260.92,7271.564,Can you walk us through the process of what neighbors can expect whether they're talking to a CSO officer or a regular officer and how that response is supposed to happen.,185,,
1220,0.97,7271.564,7272.331,Thank you.,185,,
1221,0.97,7272.465,7276.836,Yes.,186,,
1222,0.97,7276.836,7281.073,"Thank you for the question, Councilmember Morales.",186,,
1223,0.97,7281.073,7284.443,It's an interesting point that you added there between sworn officer and a CSO.,186,,
1224,0.97,7284.443,7288.914,I'll start with the CSO.,186,,
1225,0.97,7288.914,7299.558,"For example, a community where you have small business owners that may be less familiar with the 911 system and interacting with police.",186,,
1226,0.97,7299.558,7315.207,"When we have the community engagement from a CSO, we could have a situation, for example, where the CSO could explain with a threshold for a crime is versus a nuisance, what the obligation of the business owner is.",186,,
1227,0.97,7315.207,7324.784,"For example, the code that requires that they clean up tagging versus, you know, expecting the city to clean up the tagging.",186,,
1228,0.97,7324.784,7328.054,"In some cases, the city has supported.",186,,
1229,0.97,7328.054,7329.622,But that type of differentiation.,186,,
1230,0.97,7329.622,7373.199,"How the system works, for example, they can explain the flow of a patrol officer taking a report that is then forwarded to, for example, a precinct detective that follows up on property crimes, Liaising between the supervisor about where the case is going to go and following up on leads like that, what to expect from the detective contact, what type of things they can do to prevent a recurrence such as lighting or, you know, some of the environmental design issues.",186,,
1231,0.97,7373.199,7389.515,"However, we are, to put a fine point on it, we are trying to make sure that they understand the environmental design issues while actually referring those to the crime prevention Coordinators certified in the environmental design issues for crime prevention.",186,,
1232,0.97,7389.515,7394.587,They can do some of those things and get a feel for the neighborhood and create a constant point of contact.,186,,
1233,0.97,7394.587,7399.992,"With a 911 call, you get the available officer that can make it out.",186,,
1234,0.97,7399.992,7415.207,"So you may see a difference in today I got officer X, and then on officer X's weekend, now I have officer Y, a relief officer for the District because officer X is normally gone.",186,,
1235,0.97,7415.207,7429.088,They are working toward--we are working forward getting them fully engaged with the precincts.,186,,
1236,0.97,7429.088,7433.926,But supplements that with the Csos and their ability to follow up and spend more time.,186,,
1237,0.97,7433.926,7440.933,One of the examples I can think of is a grocery store in South end where there was frequent 911 calls.,186,,
1238,0.97,7440.933,7449.809,And an officer due to call load may or may not be able to invest the time with the store manager.,186,,
1239,0.97,7449.809,7464.824,Where the CSO can sit for a couple of hours and engage and monitor for a great difference between them would be an officer may have a duty to act when they witness something in front of them.,186,,
1240,0.97,7464.824,7480.206,Where the CSO not being a sworn officer can continue to watch for the pattern and engage and get the citizen perspective of what's happening.,186,,
1241,0.97,7480.206,7493.986,"To round out the answer, when a 911 call comes in, it's based on the current call load at the time, based on the emergency level of the call, for example, a shooting above a tagging call.",186,,
1242,0.97,7493.986,7500.359,And the resources may or may not get there immediately.,186,,
1243,0.97,7500.359,7515.441,"They may, you know, get this separate from another officer that's going to a different one and not immediately see that there may be a tie in between issues until further down the chain.",186,,
1244,0.97,7515.441,7531.357,A CSO should be able to see the ongoing issues in the community Aopposed to three different sets of officer going to three property crimes discovered at different things.,186,,
1245,0.97,7531.357,7534.36,"At a Seahawks game, 100 people got the car broke into.",186,,
1246,0.97,7534.36,7536.428,Thank you.,187,,
1247,0.97,7536.428,7537.696,I'm sorry.,187,,
1248,0.97,7537.696,7540.432,I appreciate your thorough answer.,187,,
1249,0.97,7540.432,7542.468,We do need to wrap up.,187,,
1250,0.97,7542.468,7548.807,We're quickly running out of time and we have two more items on the agenda.,187,,
1251,0.97,7548.807,7562.421,"I appreciate you for taking the time to come and present to us about this really important public safety program that Council is very, very supportive of.",187,,
1252,0.97,7562.421,7564.156,And do come and speak with us again.,187,,
1253,0.97,7564.29,7565.19,Thank you so much for your time.,188,,
1254,0.97,7565.324,7568.827,All right.,189,,
1255,0.97,7568.961,7572.765,Item number six.,190,,
1256,0.97,7572.765,7573.699,"Alex, please read item six.",190,,
1257,0.97,7573.699,7575.267,Supervised consumption presentation.,191,,
1258,0.97,7575.401,7575.701,Thank you.,192,,
1259,0.97,7575.701,7578.437,All right.,192,,
1260,0.97,7578.437,7583.876,Let's kick it off with a quick round of introductions from the Presenters.,192,,
1261,0.97,7584.009,7591.417,"Chair her bold, I think it would be great if--my name is Jesse Rawlins.",193,,
1262,0.97,7591.417,7595.454,I'll be leading the presentation today.,193,,
1263,0.97,7595.454,7599.158,I was wondering if brad Finegood from public health could go first?,193,,
1264,0.97,7599.158,7599.491,Absolutely.,194,,
1265,0.97,7599.491,7604.83,To ground us in some of the Overdose rates here in Seattle and King County.,195,,
1266,0.97,7604.964,7608.467,Sounds like a sound place to begin.,196,,
1267,0.97,7608.767,7609.568,.,196,,
1268,0.97,7616.709,7617.076,Good afternoon.,197,,
1269,0.97,7617.076,7617.609,This is brad Finegood.,197,,
1270,0.97,7617.609,7621.046,"Thank you, Councilmember her bold and members of the committee.",197,,
1271,0.97,7621.046,7625.284,I am with public health Seattle King County.,197,,
1272,0.97,7625.284,7635.427,I was one of the Cochairs of the heroin and Opiate Council.,197,,
1273,0.97,7635.427,7644.536,"I am going to share the data points with Council today, if I can get my technology working right.",197,,
1274,0.97,7644.536,7644.937,Let's see here.,197,,
1275,0.97,7644.937,7648.374,My apologies.,197,,
1276,0.97,7648.674,7669.795,Can everyone see my screen now?,197,,
1277,0.97,7669.795,7669.928,.,197,,
1278,0.97,7669.928,7670.596,Yes.,198,,
1279,0.97,7670.596,7670.929,Thank you.,199,,
1280,0.97,7670.929,7671.13,Okay.,199,,
1281,0.97,7671.13,7681.607,"So brad Finegood, just a little bit of the general Overdose numbers in King County.",199,,
1282,0.97,7681.607,7689.748,Overdoses continue to rise and they have continued to rise year other year since we held our task force in 2015.,199,,
1283,0.97,7689.748,7708.867,The biggest category that has continued to arise is the people who individuals who have died of Overdoses that have multiple drugs in their system.,199,,
1284,0.97,7708.867,7717.209,"We're seeing a continuing complexity of Overdose numbers, Overdose deaths, and people who are using drugs that have negative consequences.",199,,
1285,0.97,7717.209,7726.151,So you will see that there are two numbers that are going up drastically in the community.,199,,
1286,0.97,7726.151,7730.355,Those--this is where certain drugs are involved in people's system.,199,,
1287,0.97,7730.355,7735.027,And I'm happy to come back at a later time to talk more about that.,199,,
1288,0.97,7735.027,7747.339,But the two most prominent drugs on the rise in people's systems that have led to Overdose deaths are Methamphetamine and Fentanyl.,199,,
1289,0.97,7747.339,7749.274,Fentanyl very much so County wide.,199,,
1290,0.97,7749.274,7756.815,Heroin and Methamphetamine much more has been an issue in Overdose deaths in the city of Seattle.,199,,
1291,0.97,7756.815,7766.692,So here's a little bit of numbers and geographic impacts of Overdose deaths.,199,,
1292,0.97,7766.692,7770.729,Fentanyl Overdose deaths are more predominant in the outlying cities of the county.,199,,
1293,0.97,7770.729,7784.143,Where 40% of Fentanyl- Fentanyl-Involved deaths are in the city of Seattle.,199,,
1294,0.97,7784.143,7790.749,And almost 60% is in the rest of the county.,199,,
1295,0.97,7790.749,7797.322,"Non-Fentanyl-Involved Overdose deaths, primarily with heroin and Methamphetamine, those continue to see significant impacts, the most significant impacts in the city of Seattle.",199,,
1296,0.97,7797.322,7801.226,And that continues to be very much clustered in the urban core.,199,,
1297,0.97,7801.226,7803.962,That is my quick update.,199,,
1298,0.97,7803.962,7808.233,And I wanted to make sure to share time with everybody else.,199,,
1299,0.97,7808.367,7809.601,"Thank you, brad.",200,,
1300,0.97,7809.601,7815.774,So what's the proposal?,200,,
1301,0.97,7815.774,7824.149,I understand that the recommended model has shifted over the last several months.,200,,
1302,0.97,7824.149,7843.302,"And that's what we're here to talk about is, you know, what's new in the campaign and the proposal that we are speaking to to support funding with the funding that the city has put aside for this purpose?",200,,
1303,0.97,7843.302,7845.671,"Thank you, chair her bold.",201,,
1304,0.97,7845.671,7853.111,"And thank you, brad, for giving us that information on local Statistics around our Overdose crisis.",201,,
1305,0.97,7853.111,7859.818,So I wanted to start off with introductions.,201,,
1306,0.97,7859.818,7879.338,We will have a presentation today from yes to safe consumption spaces presenting on the local strategies for implements Scs.,201,,
1307,0.97,7879.338,7880.739,I'm Jesse Rawlins.,201,,
1308,0.97,7880.739,7884.276,Thank you for having us and for being here.,201,,
1309,0.97,7884.276,7885.978,My name is Jesse Rawlins.,201,,
1310,0.97,7885.978,7890.082,And I'm the public policy manager at the public defender Association.,201,,
1311,0.97,7890.082,7893.318,And I will let mark introduce himself next.,201,,
1312,0.97,7893.452,7898.257,Good morning.,202,,
1313,0.97,7898.257,7899.191,Thank you Councilmembers.,202,,
1314,0.97,7899.191,7904.429,"I'm mark Kooks, an attorney with the ACLU of Washington and a member of the campaign.",202,,
1315,0.97,7904.563,7911.637,And then if we could have Dr. waters.,203,,
1316,0.97,7911.637,7912.671,Hello.,204,,
1317,0.97,7912.671,7918.143,"My name is Richard waters, a primary care physician speaking on my own.",204,,
1318,0.97,7918.143,7921.246,I work with people who use drugs and those experiencing homelessness.,204,,
1319,0.97,7921.246,7921.58,Thank you.,205,,
1320,0.97,7921.58,7924.85,And then Michael?,205,,
1321,0.97,7924.983,7928.787,Good morning.,206,,
1322,0.97,7928.787,7936.795,"Michael anyone Ninburg, the executive director of hepatitis education.",206,,
1323,0.97,7936.929,7938.83,"And then Lastly, Lisa.",207,,
1324,0.97,7938.83,7942.534,.,207,,
1325,0.97,7942.534,7943.402,"Hi, everyone.",208,,
1326,0.97,7943.402,7946.872,I'm a long-term North Seattle resident.,208,,
1327,0.97,7946.872,7951.176,"A mother, a homeowner, and Cofounder of Aurora Commons here in North Seattle.",208,,
1328,0.97,7951.31,7954.98,"Thank you, everyone, for introducing yourself.",209,,
1329,0.97,7954.98,7962.487,So we are going to be very efficient with our presentation today and hit high levels and try to leave time at the end for questions.,209,,
1330,0.97,7962.487,7969.561,So we're kind of going to give a brief description of our yes to Scs time line.,209,,
1331,0.97,7969.561,7980.639,What we're talking about for local strategy for Scs Impmentation.,209,,
1332,0.97,7980.639,7991.216,So I'm going to turn it other to mark to start us off with our time line of Scs here in Seattle King County.,209,,
1333,0.97,7991.35,7992.517,"Thank you, Jesse.",210,,
1334,0.97,7992.517,7996.288,And apologies if there's dog barking noise.,210,,
1335,0.97,7996.288,8008.433,So we actually just hit the four-year anniversary last week for when the Seattle King County Opiate task force released its findings.,210,,
1336,0.97,8008.433,8010.335,That seems like a long time ago.,210,,
1337,0.97,8010.335,8011.67,But the need is still there.,210,,
1338,0.97,8011.67,8018.91,And we are still committed to trying to get this public health intervention implemented.,210,,
1339,0.97,8018.91,8025.283,"Shortly after the report came out, the King County board of health endorsed this practice.",210,,
1340,0.97,8025.283,8034.292,We got a resolution in 2017 that put this on very strong legal footing.,210,,
1341,0.97,8034.292,8041.867,"Which led into budgetary decisions, which I think Jesse was going to give a little more detail on.",210,,
1342,0.97,8041.867,8042.1,Yeah.,211,,
1343,0.97,8042.1,8049.775,We wanted to recognize that this body has shown a lot of leadership around Scs.,211,,
1344,0.97,8049.775,8055.714,In particular in 2018 through Y'all's budget authority allocated $1.3 million.,211,,
1345,0.97,8055.714,8065.323,"And then in 2019, allocated an additional $100,000.",211,,
1346,0.97,8065.323,8083.742,"In 2020, chair her bold in being brilliant in the legislative details found that the $100,000 allocated was not included in the Finance.",211,,
1347,0.97,8083.742,8088.48,I appreciate chair her bold with marrying the two.,211,,
1348,0.97,8088.613,8094.92,And all credit goes to Christine in my office for finding that oversight.,212,,
1349,0.97,8095.053,8113.305,"So moving along, so as you know, the--what we have been pushing for is we have historically talked about implementing two pilot Scss.",213,,
1350,0.97,8113.305,8117.976,One in Seattle and one in King County.,213,,
1351,0.97,8117.976,8120.545,That's what the recommendations the task force recommended.,213,,
1352,0.97,8120.545,8125.984,And much of that advocacy was around a stand alone site.,213,,
1353,0.97,8125.984,8139.965,And what we're here today is to discuss an involved strategy for implementing Scs.,213,,
1354,0.97,8139.965,8146.671,The strategy is implementing supervised or safer consumption services that serve people who use drugs.,213,,
1355,0.97,8146.671,8156.815,So what we know actually is that unsafe or Unsupervised consumption already occurs at many of the locations.,213,,
1356,0.97,8156.815,8171.229,We're here today to advocate for support and implementation.,213,,
1357,0.97,8171.229,8190.949,"In addition to unsafe and Unsupervised Consumptions already happening at these locations, 80% of survey respondents in the most recent syringe program survey, 880%, again, about how they would use the Scs services.",213,,
1358,0.97,8190.949,8199.958,"In 2016, 15 months after the city started its needle collection pilot, over 5,000 needles were removed from public space.",213,,
1359,0.97,8199.958,8219.277,"And I just wanted to highlight that there have been--since the task force made its recommendation, 754 people in inside Seattle have died from fatal Overdoses.",213,,
1360,0.97,8219.277,8227.285,What's super fascinating is that 14% of county-wide Overdose rates with affected by people experiencing homelessness.,213,,
1361,0.97,8227.285,8238.296,"And comparing that to the total population, 0.5% of King County's population is experiencing homelessness.",213,,
1362,0.97,8238.296,8241.866,So that's 14% versus 0.5%.,213,,
1363,0.97,8241.866,8252.077,"So again, just highlighting the disproportionate Overdoses and how Scss would be a beneficial approach for the vulnerable folks that use drugs.",213,,
1364,0.97,8252.077,8261.286,So now I'm going to turn it over to mark to talk just a little bit about the legal landscape of Scs.,213,,
1365,0.97,8261.286,8261.62,Thank you.,214,,
1366,0.97,8261.62,8264.956,I'll be very brief.,214,,
1367,0.97,8264.956,8279.571,"Just wanted to kind of point back to the 2016 task force report which really did, you know, try to Delve into the legal questions Thalgd come be opening up this type of intervention.",214,,
1368,0.97,8279.571,8289.447,"The big thing to remember is that when it comes to public health and public safety regulation that legally speaking, those are local and state issues and not Federal issues.",214,,
1369,0.97,8289.447,8297.222,"And the law is quite clear that, you know, local governments and States don't need to be in step in Federal law.",214,,
1370,0.97,8297.222,8304.829,"And you know, examples of that is things like needle exchanges or marijuana laws.",214,,
1371,0.97,8304.829,8321.479,"There are much more clear cut Federal drug crimes happening in Seattle every day, thousands of times, when people are purchasing marijuana, which continues to be an illegal Federal crime.",214,,
1372,0.97,8321.479,8329.921,So when it comes to implementing something that is not a drug crime at all based on the Federal crack House statute.,214,,
1373,0.97,8329.921,8334.526,It's unfortunate when people raise the speck Tor of Federal law enforcement as a reason not to move forward with this.,214,,
1374,0.97,8334.526,8352.11,So really just wanted to remind this body that you have great authority when it comes to regulating issues of public health and public safety and feel strongly than a consumption space fits in that.,214,,
1375,0.97,8352.11,8365.857,"If you're looking for a really good example, I would point to the Seattle city attorneys brief that was filed recently in the case out of Philadelphia that was looking at these exact issues.",214,,
1376,0.97,8365.857,8379.137,"In that case, which is still ongoing and not binding on Seattle, the judge made quite clear that this notion that a consumption space violating Federal law is not correct.",214,,
1377,0.97,8379.137,8388.58,"The intent of the facilities is public health and to connect people with treatment and services, not to facilitate drug crimes.",214,,
1378,0.97,8388.58,8391.85,I would reiterate there is very strong legal ground for the facilities.,214,,
1379,0.97,8391.85,8395.019,And the city of Seattle should move forward.,214,,
1380,0.97,8395.019,8395.687,It's been much too long.,214,,
1381,0.97,8395.687,8398.623,The money has been sitting there are if years.,214,,
1382,0.97,8398.623,8400.792,Please put it to good news.,214,,
1383,0.97,8400.925,8418.71,"And just a put a finer point on mark, thanks again, is that the city of Seattle has kind of continuously and historically advanced policies in Definement with Federal Government.",215,,
1384,0.97,8418.71,8426.518,So we would continue to ask that such policies be pushed for vulnerable folks that use drugs as well.,215,,
1385,0.97,8426.518,8436.761,So now I'll turn it over to Dr. waters to give his perspective around health care components with Scs.,215,,
1386,0.97,8436.895,8437.896,"Thanks, Jesse and mark.",216,,
1387,0.97,8437.896,8439.931,And thanks to the Councilmembers for having us.,216,,
1388,0.97,8439.931,8445.47,"From a health care provider perspective, I fully support his.",216,,
1389,0.97,8445.47,8451.042,It makes a lot of sense for individual health and public health.,216,,
1390,0.97,8451.042,8457.115,And it should be concept Liesed as a strategy to reduce drug use overall.,216,,
1391,0.97,8457.115,8470.094,We have needle exchanges that are a proven intervention to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis or HIV.,216,,
1392,0.97,8470.094,8476.201,"And the folks most vulnerable, Scs continues this and can reduce the risks further.",216,,
1393,0.97,8476.201,8498.356,"Reducing fatal Overdoses and also further reducing viral hepatitis spread, HIV, and costly to human health and health care costs, dangerous bacterial infections, the heart valve infections, has potential to improve those.",216,,
1394,0.97,8498.356,8503.761,"And existing sites, there can be pathways to access the drug treatment programs.",216,,
1395,0.97,8503.761,8512.103,That's exciting and will be potentially very effective at reducing overall drug use in the long term.,216,,
1396,0.97,8512.103,8525.283,Some may lament this idea and say why don't we go all in on drug treatment programs and skip the idea of a safe con Sufrps site.,216,,
1397,0.97,8525.283,8542.367,That Miss the idea that building trust and relationships over the long term is key and essential for kind of durable engagement into drug reduction programs and to kind of decrease harm.,216,,
1398,0.97,8542.367,8544.035,So I think these complement each other.,216,,
1399,0.97,8544.035,8558.283,"And certainly, the kind of other benefit is bringing existing drug use that is already happening in safe, ad hoc drug consumption spaces.",216,,
1400,0.97,8558.283,8568.026,"Indoors, out of the public eye, to places that are safe and welcoming, and again, can improve engagement with the clients we already serve.",216,,
1401,0.97,8568.026,8568.293,Thank you.,216,,
1402,0.97,8568.293,8584.842,"And while we're Transitioning to the last slide introducing Lisa and Michael, I will also add that the city executive has kind of continued to label budget constraints around moving forward with Scs.",217,,
1403,0.97,8584.842,8594.285,And so we don't find those budget constraints as legitimate with this evolved strategy.,217,,
1404,0.97,8594.285,8604.195,We believe that the resources available would be sufficient for implementing Scs at existing social service locations.,217,,
1405,0.97,8604.195,8617.075,We'll hear from two providers very briefly about their interest in implementing the Scs at their social service locations.,217,,
1406,0.97,8617.075,8617.575,Lisa and Michael.,217,,
1407,0.97,8617.575,8617.809,Okay.,218,,
1408,0.97,8617.809,8634.592,"Before we transition, I just want to--because it is 11:59 and several of my colleagues are running off to another committee meeting, I wanted to give the Councilmembers an opportunity to ask questions at this juncture.",218,,
1409,0.97,8634.592,8634.859,Great.,219,,
1410,0.97,8634.993,8640.298,Just taking a pause for a moment.,220,,
1411,0.97,8640.298,8643.301,All right.,220,,
1412,0.97,8643.301,8643.635,Hearing none.,220,,
1413,0.97,8643.635,8644.502,Go ahead.,220,,
1414,0.97,8644.502,8644.802,Thank you.,220,,
1415,0.97,8644.936,8654.512,"Michael or Lisa, would Y'all like to talk?",221,,
1416,0.97,8654.512,8654.746,Sure.,222,,
1417,0.97,8654.746,8656.814,I can go.,222,,
1418,0.97,8656.814,8660.518,Yes.,222,,
1419,0.97,8660.518,8661.019,"Thank you, council.",222,,
1420,0.97,8661.019,8664.389,I am here to Unabashedly plead with you to release the money to Scs.,222,,
1421,0.97,8664.389,8680.004,"I know with my whole heart and 18 years of experience accompanying folks living unsheltered, engaging in survival, sex workers, consuming drugs, this is the moral thing to do.",222,,
1422,0.97,8680.004,8696.154,"What I witness every day are 60 to 125 unique resilient citizens of your city who do not want to die, but rather want desperately to live and make means of their lives.",222,,
1423,0.97,8696.154,8704.996,"I'm here to tell you that what is behind our walls, each and every one of us on this call, is hurting at times and lonely at times.",222,,
1424,0.97,8704.996,8709.667,Only we have the privilege of hiding how we cope behind four walls.,222,,
1425,0.97,8709.667,8713.204,And the precious folks who need Scs do not have that privilege.,222,,
1426,0.97,8713.204,8723.281,They're outdoors and pushed more and more away from our society and absolutely told and treated as though they are expendable.,222,,
1427,0.97,8723.281,8738.896,What we are saying to you now is safe consumption spaces with places like Aurora Commons that engage and context Yulize Story-Driven care.,222,,
1428,0.97,8738.896,8742.333,Folks are threat where they are and treated as if they matter.,222,,
1429,0.97,8742.333,8751.776,"In the spaces, the folks can come out of the shadows and access comprehensive care in a way and at places they feel safe and not condemned.",222,,
1430,0.97,8751.776,8764.122,"I want to be really clear, the Scs Colaekted in people's communities is not only a kindness, but it is the right public health response we need.",222,,
1431,0.97,8764.122,8766.057,I have seen this work firsthand.,222,,
1432,0.97,8766.057,8776.0,"Funding this will not only prevent hundreds of unnecessary preventable deaths of precious people, it will make the communities safer.",222,,
1433,0.97,8776.0,8778.136,My own young children's parks safer.,222,,
1434,0.97,8778.136,8780.238,And this is absolutely the kindness that we need right now.,222,,
1435,0.97,8780.238,8780.938,Thank you.,222,,
1436,0.97,8781.072,8782.84,Thank you.,223,,
1437,0.97,8782.974,8784.041,"Thanks so much, Lisa.",224,,
1438,0.97,8784.041,8798.956,"Michael, do you want to briefly talk about your perspective and how you could possibly incorporate the funding at hepatitis education project?",224,,
1439,0.97,8798.956,8800.825,Yes.,225,,
1440,0.97,8800.825,8802.36,I would love to.,225,,
1441,0.97,8802.36,8805.797,"Thank you, Lisa, and everyone else.",225,,
1442,0.97,8805.797,8811.502,I think there's understanding that we have a problem that needs to be addressed.,225,,
1443,0.97,8811.502,8813.304,We have money set aside that has not been allocated.,225,,
1444,0.97,8813.304,8827.018,"And organizations like ours, like Aurora Commons where we do things like provide Noloxone.",225,,
1445,0.97,8827.018,8839.163,"And our participants, 75% of whom report living homeless in the last year, reversed 650 Overdoses in 2019.",225,,
1446,0.97,8839.163,8841.332,So we have the tools to really make this problem better.,225,,
1447,0.97,8841.332,8852.81,"And it's not just about the supervised consumption, it's about as Dr. waters said getting people other services that they want or need.",225,,
1448,0.97,8852.81,8861.719,We provide a low barrier orphan program at Hep.,225,,
1449,0.97,8861.719,8866.557,We do testing and care for hepatitis and HIV.,225,,
1450,0.97,8866.557,8875.032,"And we get people who are not getting the services anywhere else, the services they need.",225,,
1451,0.97,8875.032,8895.853,"I would also strongly urge you, chair her bold, to do what you can to release these funds to organizations that can actually put them to work and prevent some of those 754 Overdose deaths that have occurred since the moneys were originally allocated.",225,,
1452,0.97,8895.853,8905.429,I want to clarify for the viewing public that the Council has allocated these resources.,226,,
1453,0.97,8905.429,8914.472,"We do not have the authority under our current allocation as it has been structured, we don't have the authority to release them.",226,,
1454,0.97,8914.472,8927.118,I want to clarify that the recent program proposal has been sent to human services director Jason Johnson with the request for feedback.,226,,
1455,0.97,8927.118,8932.156,I have requested that the law Department provide written feedback as well.,226,,
1456,0.97,8932.156,8954.312,"But I want to just clarify that, you know, I can try to facilitate a willingness on the part of the human services director to release if funding.",226,,
1457,0.97,8954.312,8963.22,"But absent another strategy, the ability--the decision making will be with the human services director and the Mayor's office.",226,,
1458,0.97,8963.22,8976.567,"Now, if there is another approach that you think that the Council should be considering in order to get these dollars that we have allocated out the door, I think it's important for us to hear that as well.",226,,
1459,0.97,8976.701,8996.387,"Chair her bold, you're the genius here, but my understanding is that further action would be required to move the funds from Finance general to the Bcl where the public health contract is.",227,,
1460,0.97,8996.387,8996.887,That's my understanding.,227,,
1461,0.97,8996.887,9006.764,And so there could be some necessary further action.,227,,
1462,0.97,9006.764,9009.8,"But you are correct, we urgently need the Mayor to spend the dollars.",227,,
1463,0.97,9009.934,9011.002,All right.,228,,
1464,0.97,9011.002,9012.436,Thank you.,228,,
1465,0.97,9012.436,9026.283,"Again, as mentioned, we have shared the proposal with the human services Department.",228,,
1466,0.97,9026.283,9076.667,"And have offered an opportunity for a Rentive from human services Department the talk with us about how to move forward this budgetary priority of the Council, you know, given that I think the recommendations for allowing agencies who already provide these types of services, treatment services, to also do supervised consumption is really smart way to go, given the difficulties around pursuing sort of a brick and mortar strategy.",228,,
1467,0.97,9076.667,9077.868,So appreciate understanding.,228,,
1468,0.97,9077.868,9087.011,I don't know if we--I think we intended to have somebody from public health with us?,228,,
1469,0.97,9087.011,9090.147,That was brad Finegood who spoke.,229,,
1470,0.97,9090.147,9090.514,Fantastic.,230,,
1471,0.97,9090.514,9092.783,Is brad still with us?,230,,
1472,0.97,9092.783,9096.353,"Yes, Ma'am.",231,,
1473,0.97,9096.353,9097.421,So appreciate the background on Overdoses.,232,,
1474,0.97,9097.421,9109.7,Can you just speak to whether or not the supervised consumption services proposal is in fact Alined with the task force recommendations?,232,,
1475,0.97,9109.7,9109.834,.,232,,
1476,0.97,9109.834,9110.434,"Yes, thank you.",233,,
1477,0.97,9110.434,9121.245,"And assistant one of the Cochairs of the task force, we recommended supervised consumption spaces in a minimum of two places in King County.",233,,
1478,0.97,9121.245,9124.849,So the proposal put forth today is Alined with what the task force recommended.,233,,
1479,0.97,9124.982,9132.289,All right.,234,,
1480,0.97,9132.289,9133.123,.,234,,
1481,0.97,9133.123,9133.591,Thank you.,235,,
1482,0.97,9133.591,9139.864,If you don't mind taking down the slide so I can see my colleagues.,235,,
1483,0.97,9139.864,9140.064,Great.,235,,
1484,0.97,9140.064,9144.935,I don't know if other Councilmembers have any closing thoughts or questions.,235,,
1485,0.97,9144.935,9153.544,I do know that many of us have a competing meeting that started seven minutes ago.,235,,
1486,0.97,9153.544,9167.791,"And so I just want to say publicly, I don't know if my staff have reached the Presenters for the Co-Lead presentation.",235,,
1487,0.97,9167.791,9176.634,I fear that we have not been able to reach everybody because I do see the Icons for some folks still on the zoom call.,235,,
1488,0.97,9176.634,9182.84,But we are going to have to adjourn the meeting.,235,,
1489,0.97,9182.84,9191.115,And I'm going to work to see if I can find some other time for Co-Lead Presenters to bring back their presentation.,235,,
1490,0.97,9191.115,9200.057,I think it's really important for Councilmembers to hear it before we move into the budget cycle.,235,,
1491,0.97,9200.057,9208.232,And so I'm looking and hoping for Maybe some time on a Monday morning briefing agenda sometime soon.,235,,
1492,0.97,9208.232,9213.604,"And if I'm successful, you will have the audience of nine city council members rather than four.",235,,
1493,0.97,9213.604,9218.475,So fingers crossed.,235,,
1494,0.97,9218.475,9221.178,And my apologies for running long.,235,,
1495,0.97,9221.312,9225.449,"Thanks, Councilmember her bold.",236,,
1496,0.97,9225.449,9232.389,We would be happy to do that and love the audience of all nine.,236,,
1497,0.97,9232.389,9232.79,Thank you.,237,,
1498,0.97,9232.79,9233.791,Love your flexibility.,237,,
