96,0.97,437.503,439.505,This would add another approximately one million.,44,,
97,0.97,439.505,451.951,The Office of economic development for the purpose of expanding the business small business stabilization fund.,44,,
98,0.97,451.951,459.559,This is shifting money from the low-income housing fund in the office of housing.,44,,
99,0.97,459.559,473.573,My understanding is that the office of housing plans to do--there will be an additional opportunity for funding for housing in the fall.,44,,
100,0.97,473.573,495.695,"And while I completely understand the struggle and this is probably the first of many that we are going to have to balance, how we make the adjustments to our plans during this crisis, you know it is important that we support small business and certainly shouldn't be putting them against any housing production that we will be doing.",44,,
101,0.97,495.695,511.444,And we know that we have very limited options as a city for how we support small business and community development and block grant money is one of the very few options.,44,,
102,0.97,511.444,521.287,I am going to we support this bill so we can expand the support for small businesses through the stabilization fund for small businesses.,44,,
103,0.97,521.287,543.843,"I do want to say if I might, as I have said many times already during the crisis we need to be aware of you know that we are not robbing Peter to pay Paul during the crisis and as we look to the emergency measures that we are taking and not creating new systems that create inequities in our community be.",44,,
104,0.97,543.843,549.548,With that said I think it is important that we proceed with this bill.,44,,
105,0.97,549.548,550.383,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,45,,
106,0.97,550.383,555.988,Are there any comments on the bill?,45,,
107,0.97,555.988,559.125,Council President Gonzelez this is Councilmember Mosqueda.,46,,
108,0.97,559.125,560.359,You have the floor.,47,,
109,0.97,560.359,568.334,Thank you and thanks to the sponsor for bringing this.,48,,
110,0.97,568.334,591.924,I want to talk about the Department of housing we have confirmed that the redirection of these Cbg funds will not hurt any existing housing problems and will village length be with our partners in the Mayor's office as we move forward to make sure there is sufficient funding for the housing and the roughly one million in redirection will not affect the currently funded projects.,48,,
111,0.97,591.924,616.015,I want to thank the office of housing for their opportunity to engage with us and there is no negative impacts as we think about the emergency especially as we think about how important it is for folks to have access to housing and affordable housing in the near future when and if this virus continues in the fall and winter.,48,,
112,0.97,616.015,625.825,We want to make sure that the housing projects continue and there is funding allocated this year and next year moving forward on these important housing projects.,48,,
113,0.97,625.825,641.907,I think that we talked a little about it this morning and how the Covid-19 pandemic has made this more critical and our strategy for creating affordable housing and stability.,48,,
114,0.97,641.907,654.153,As we ramp up our shelter capacity and think about assessment facilities that we will stand up soon having equal amount of emphasis on building affordable housing it will be critical.,48,,
115,0.97,654.153,687.987,I want to thank the Mayor's office and budget office to explain the budget impact of this decision and overall to echo what Councilmember Morales said and make sure that Covid- 19 crisis when it means loss of revenue we will protect funding including affordable housing and this is a good use of the funds and appreciate the effort to get the funds out the door.,48,,
116,0.97,687.987,689.789,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,49,,
117,0.97,689.789,695.161,Are there any comments?,50,,
118,0.97,695.161,698.631,I heard two people.,51,,
119,0.97,698.631,701.6,Couple member Herbold and Swant.,51,,
120,0.97,701.6,709.875,I heard Councilmember Herbold and then I will call on Councilmember Sawant.,52,,
121,0.97,709.875,711.077,Thank you.,53,,
122,0.97,711.077,746.645,I appreciate knowing the transfer of funds in the housing Department will not impact other funding commitments to our affordable housing project and that the CVG fund can support the business system programs as other city and state funds can't be used to provide assistance due to constitutional limitations.,53,,
123,0.97,746.645,761.627,We know that Covid-19 will put pressure on many thousands of household that will be out of work or unemployed and struggling to make end meet as well as pressures on the affordable housing providers.,53,,
124,0.97,761.627,765.798,A tight margin to keep people housed.,53,,
125,0.97,765.798,786.986,I reached out to the development consortium and supportive of this legislation but we need to assume that housing may be a key component of the response to Covid-19 and I don't want to regret these kinds of transfers away from the office of housing.,53,,
126,0.97,786.986,805.037,We know that the Washington alliance has made a request of the governor's office that should any future shelter in place orders be instituted that housing production be considered an essential opportunity and be permitted to continue.,53,,
127,0.97,805.037,810.276,"In addition to the housing, affordable housing projects planned.",53,,
128,0.97,810.276,822.087,It seems likely that we may have emergency housing related needs where future Cvbg funds could be important source.,53,,
129,0.97,822.087,834.233,We checked in with the city's Cvbq administrator.,53,,
130,0.97,834.233,839.471,We know that affordable housing is defined as affordable service.,53,,
131,0.97,839.471,847.246,We are limited to funds that we can spend on services such as emergency shelter and housing.,53,,
132,0.97,847.246,875.908,We are permit the 39% .9% of the total Cvbg grant so that 36% has been contracted out for 2020 but our Cvbg indicates that Congress may be working on temporary relief to remove the cap on public services for Cvbg.,53,,
133,0.97,875.908,914.179,We will be kept updated on the progress on this but what that means is we may have the ability to use more Cvbg funds for emergency shelters and emergency housing related needs related to Covid-19 and so I think this important conversation that we are having now about striking the right balance between all of these competing needs is really critical to the city to be fair and meet those needs.,53,,
134,0.97,914.179,919.451,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,54,,
135,0.97,919.451,919.918,Councilmember Sawant.,54,,
136,0.97,919.918,922.087,Thank you President Gonzelez.,55,,
137,0.97,922.087,956.655,I haven't concerns about this bill from the Mayor and not only this bill but the concern that it will become a pattern from the emergency orders that come forward and that it will be ongoing issue and I have shared my concerns with Councilmember Morales in advance but I wanted to share them here and what I intend to do this today in terms of the vote.,55,,
138,0.97,956.655,977.576,"If funds released for small businesses that absolutely support this, it was my office and community members that we were able to fight for businesses in a district certain years ago and the money was unprecedented with people of color.",55,,
139,0.97,977.576,994.093,So there is no question that small businesses are struggling as well as the vast majority working people from this crisis however this bill will pay.,55,,
140,0.97,994.093,1011.41,"I believe it is accurate it does not come from currently planned projects, that is true but takes away from other projects, Probablies of the 2020 that will come under 2020.",55,,
141,0.97,1011.41,1011.977,The funding availability.,55,,
142,0.97,1011.977,1027.426,"My office estimates that if this million dollars, the funds, housing funds are not made whole this could cost ten individual families affordable homes during this crisis.",55,,
143,0.97,1027.426,1040.372,That is concrete loss that could happen and I don't understand why we have to do that when there is a lot of money in the city just in the hands of the wealthy and big business.,55,,
144,0.97,1040.372,1056.922,"It would be reasonable to ask whether the affordable housing is being suspended with shelter in place, that is anticipated and we know that the notice of funding has gone out as well.",55,,
145,0.97,1056.922,1066.465,Either it will affect the schedule of affordable housing this year or it will effect in ongoing basis.,55,,
146,0.97,1066.465,1087.586,"My point is that regardless of whether this million dollars comes from the spring or fall, regardless of whether or not construction was suspended, the fundamental problems is robbing Peter to pay Paul approach.",55,,
147,0.97,1087.586,1090.923,I am anticipating more emergency orders of this kind and the Council to take action.,55,,
148,0.97,1090.923,1100.599,But I think all of this is being done in order to take on big business so we have the perpetuation of this problem.,55,,
149,0.97,1100.599,1103.202,Politics of scarcity that I don't accept.,55,,
150,0.97,1103.202,1111.61,Struggling small businesses and families need to be supported and their need should not be pitted against each other.,55,,
151,0.97,1111.61,1117.549,$66 million is a result exclusively for emergencies like this.,55,,
152,0.97,1117.549,1125.324,And we should use emergency funds rather than cutting funding for affordable housing.,55,,
153,0.97,1125.324,1131.33,There will be demands and we know that $66 million can only stretch to what is needed to support our community at this moment.,55,,
154,0.97,1131.33,1157.022,We are in a pandemic that is going to result not only in completely preventable loss of life due to the privatized health care is system and that is why Councilmember Morales and I have proposed the Amazon tax but that is not enough.,55,,
155,0.97,1157.022,1176.375,The city needs to use the emergency Fund and approve the Amazon tax to make additional funding available and demand that state ask by closing corporate tax loop holes and passing taxes at the state level.,55,,
156,0.97,1176.375,1185.35,My office checked about amending the bill to do this but because this is change legally can't be done in the same bill.,55,,
157,0.97,1185.35,1207.105,That is why if Councilmember Morales or any other Councilmember would make a motion to hold this bill I would support that motion or make that motion if no other Councilmember makes it and I don't--I wouldn't agree if Councilmembers are going to say that is holding up emergency relief.,55,,
158,0.97,1207.105,1207.506,I don't agree.,55,,
159,0.97,1207.506,1213.011,Today the Council would pass an Amazon tax and I wouldn't accept that excuse on it face value.,55,,
160,0.97,1213.011,1230.662,But I will make that motion if nobody else is going to make it and if the motion gets a majority bill we could put forth a replacement bill for emergency funds and if there is agreement I would like to put this together.,55,,
161,0.97,1230.662,1233.732,I know there is Express that the funds need to be.,55,,
162,0.97,1233.732,1242.541,[unintelligible] to be used for this person and emergency fund did not come from Cvbg.,55,,
163,0.97,1242.541,1249.081,We know this is used from Cvbg from any part of the budget than emergency funds.,55,,
164,0.97,1249.081,1274.973,I will use the guidance of the Council president and the city clerk to make that motion but I also wanted to say that if this bill goes out today I Unfortunately feel I have to vote no on it and for the reasons I explained we can't adequately address the extraordinary crisis by shifting the damage between small businesses we need a different approach.,55,,
165,0.97,1274.973,1279.077,Excuse me.,56,,
166,0.97,1279.077,1280.345,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",56,,
167,0.97,1280.345,1282.447,Intentions to hold the bill is out of order.,56,,
168,0.97,1282.447,1286.251,It is moved and Seconded and now in the discussion phase.,56,,
169,0.97,1286.251,1300.465,"If there was an interest in your part to move the bill, I believe that should have been done since it met with the Council rules at the time considering approval of the agenda.",56,,
170,0.97,1300.465,1311.076,"Will the city clerk please clarify that, my understanding of the rules of order here?",56,,

198,0.97,1453.118,1470.469,So we will now move on to continue this discussion of the previous motion that was made which was a motion that was moved and Seconded to pass Council bill 119-1760.,69,,
199,0.97,1470.469,1502.667,I appreciate the concerns that were expressed by all of the other Councilmembers including Councilmember Sawant and I understand but we want to make sure as we are considering the emergency funding sources that we are doing so in the full context of making sure that we are not engaging a mission Creek if you will that we are taking from other priorities to address the needs of the emergency response as it relates to the Coronavirus.,69,,
200,0.97,1502.667,1530.829,Unfortunately there will be situations I Thinkth we will need to make some intentional transparent decisions that may require allocation of funds in the short-term or long term and I think it is prudent for us to have a discussion so we have a clear understanding of where the lines are drawn.,69,,
201,0.97,1530.829,1539.104,I want to address the issue around small businesses and the intersection between that and affordable housing.,69,,
202,0.97,1539.104,1539.671,Several have spoke to that.,69,,
203,0.97,1539.671,1558.39,"I want to clarify it is my understanding that one of the largest housing, nonprofit housing consortiums the housing development consortium does support this small business stabilization Fund and the legislation to expand that fund.",69,,
204,0.97,1558.39,1567.766,Me have indicated in an Email to Councilmember Herbold dated March 23rd at 1:48 P.M.,69,,
205,0.97,1567.766,1579.477,That their anti displacement quality calls for support of locally owned small businesses with tools to allow them to thrive in their communities.,69,,
206,0.97,1579.477,1586.985,We understand the inextricable link with the residents to pay rent and be housed that is a concern to members.,69,,
207,0.97,1586.985,1595.226,More than ever we call for compassionate support that keeps us a strong community close quotes.,69,,
208,0.97,1595.226,1628.526,I think it is important for us to take that into consideration with the understanding they support the bill knowing it is not going to take away from existing projects and really sort of making sure that we understand that this bill is specifically not in contradiction to housing interests but is in fact something that is going to continue to promote this Council's priority around ongoing future affordable housing opportunities.,69,,
209,0.97,1628.526,1644.643,We Certainy could use more in that regard and look forward to seeing the Federal and state resources coming through to allow us to leverage future projects through the office of housing to make sure we are meeting the dire housing needs of so many in the city.,69,,
210,0.97,1644.643,1657.422,Certainly before this crisis and you know as I think many 6 us are nervous about may be exacerbated as a result of this crisis.,69,,
211,0.97,1657.422,1661.526,So Councilmembers any other individuals have comments on this?,69,,
212,0.97,1661.526,1668.967,Otherwise I will allow the Responder to make closing remarks and call this to a vote?,69,,
213,0.97,1668.967,1677.042,"Councilmember Morales, do you have any Othe comments to make on the bill before I ask the clerk to call the roll on the passage of the bill?",70,,
214,0.97,1677.042,1708.273,"I would just say that--well, as we have all said it is important that we support the small businesses, you know, this is one of the--Cvbg is one of the few sources that we have and many of the small businesses we are supporting with this Fund are themselves low income folks dealing with all of the same issues, rental issues, being able to provide for their families and so the assistance that this provides them will be important.",71,,
