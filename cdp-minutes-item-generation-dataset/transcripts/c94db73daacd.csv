154,0.804284930229187,781.8,787.2,So just kind of want to leave that out there as a foundation on these wrecked on these specific amendments.,,,

175,0.805321216583252,876.3,878.6,Have they been problematic in the past?,,,
176,0.805321216583252,878.6,884.3,"I mean, I just need more information about why this amendment is important.",,,
177,0.7748188376426697,885.4,889.9," Considering that it does ask for some work by SPD, they're short-staffed, etc.",,,
178,0.7748188376426697,889.9,890.4,Etc.,,,
179,0.7748188376426697,890.4,894.1,"So, I just wanted to get a better understanding of it.",,,
180,0.7748188376426697,894.1,899.0,"Absolutely, only tells I asked SPD to tell us what they're already doing.",,,
181,0.7748188376426697,899.0,900.5,It doesn't ask them to do anything more.,,,

183,0.7748188376426697,902.6,905.4,Only ask SPD to tell us what they're already doing.,,,
184,0.7748188376426697,906.2,908.5,How SPD ensures authenticity.,,,
185,0.7748188376426697,908.5,911.5,We're not going to change any any policies.,,,
186,0.7748188376426697,911.8,914.0,Just to tell us how they,,,
187,0.8204382061958313,914.7,916.0, How they do this function.,,,
188,0.8204382061958313,916.9,921.2,"Well, it does ask for a report by October 31st 2020.",,,
189,0.8204382061958313,921.8,926.9,And so that is asking for an additional actions.,,,

191,0.8204382061958313,932.7,939.3,If you can get to perhaps try to answer my questions because that I do believe we do.,,,
192,0.8204382061958313,940.7,944.4,I think the amendment is designed to ask the questions that you are.,,,
193,0.8801525235176086,944.5,947.6, Asking so that we get that is exactly that information.,,,
194,0.8032541871070862,950.1,950.7, Okay.,,,
195,0.8032541871070862,950.7,957.0,"Well, the recordings in question are part of standard investigative process.",,,
196,0.8032541871070862,957.0,973.0,"So I would suggest that this that when we are asking how SPD ensures the authenticity of recordings in the accurate identification of individuals in audio recordings obtained, are we talking about in general?",,,
197,0.8032541871070862,973.0,979.0,How are our audio recordings authenticated in general practice or in each?,,,
198,0.8346363306045532,979.7,980.6, Recording.,,,

201,0.90517258644104,990.1,991.9,Councilmember likely.,,,
202,0.90517258644104,991.9,992.9,You said previously.,,,
203,0.90517258644104,992.9,998.0,The the authenticity of the recording is established by standard investigative process.,,,
204,0.90517258644104,998.0,998.5,Anytime.,,,
205,0.90517258644104,998.5,1005.7,"We're conducting an investigation, any evidence that's obtained including audio recordings is validated for its authenticity further.",,,
206,0.90517258644104,1005.7,1006.6,When we go to court.,,,
207,0.90517258644104,1006.6,1014.0,"It's validated by the court process regarding admissibility, defendants in court, have the opportunity to challenge the validity.",,,
208,0.90517258644104,1014.0,1019.6,"We make our case in court and ultimately a judge in pretrial, motions determines the validity of",,,
209,0.8544618487358093,1019.7,1025.3, The audio recorded so there are checks and balances in the process even beyond our involvement in the in that.,,,
210,0.8544618487358093,1025.3,1043.9,"But when we are creating a recording or when we're seeking the recording, the standard investigative process which could include witness testimony and information from officers on scene or detectives involved in the investigation would all feed into validating that audio recording as part of the investigative process.",,,

212,0.708109974861145,1050.2,1050.9, All right.,,,

216,0.7212610244750977,1058.7,1059.3,Go ahead.,,,
217,0.7212610244750977,1059.3,1060.1,Mr. Maxie.,,,
218,0.7212610244750977,1060.7,1068.6,"I mean, I just want to Echo what Captain Britain has said and there's no technological mechanism to ensure this authenticity.",,,
219,0.7212610244750977,1068.6,1080.9,This is done through the investigative process either the Declaration of the officer that or a wire or the under the CI that wore the wire or and all of this is done pursuant to a warrant.,,,
220,0.7212610244750977,1081.2,1081.9,So the,,,
221,0.7638508081436157,1082.0,1088.1," It of these, the wires already pre-established fi the warrant application.",,,
222,0.7638508081436157,1088.1,1089.1,And then it's Captain.,,,
223,0.7638508081436157,1089.1,1105.2,"Brad said, what the use of this is in terms of prosecution, where both the department through the prosecutor, has the obligation to and the burden to prove the authenticity of this and presented under a beyond the Reasonable Doubt standard.",,,
224,0.7638508081436157,1105.2,1109.5,So I feel there are many controls in place on this.,,,
225,0.8198143839836121,1112.0,1115.3, So I this this would be our answer to the question.,,,
226,0.8198143839836121,1115.3,1123.5,"So whether we need the amendment moving forward, I don't know, or whether we can just add it into the SI are at this point with this question answered.",,,
227,0.8940680027008057,1128.3,1129.4, Councilmember her bolt.,,,
228,0.8940680027008057,1129.6,1142.4,I just wanted to sort of redirect the issue back to Lisa K. Did you do you feel like having heard the response from SPD here?,,,
229,0.8940680027008057,1142.4,1149.1,That that gets at the intent of the working group?,,,
230,0.8940680027008057,1149.1,1157.6,Or is there some additional sort of texture if you will to the desire to understand?,,,
231,0.8079826235771179,1158.4,1160.6, The authenticity of Records.,,,
232,0.9128385782241821,1162.6,1163.3, Process.,,,
233,0.8565658926963806,1165.2,1179.3," I wasn't party to the working groups deliberations, but in just reading their comments and their concerns, as well as some of the concerns raised by public member members of the public and just doing my own research.",,,
234,0.8565658926963806,1179.3,1187.7,I think that the question would be really whether any of that authenticity is verified and how its verified before it ever gets to the court.,,,
235,0.8565658926963806,1187.7,1194.3,So I understand that the court will make a ruling and that is a very strong check on the,,,
236,0.7998618483543396,1194.5,1197.5," Some of these, particularly, through the warrants.",,,
237,0.7998618483543396,1197.5,1206.8,"But I suspect that the working group may have been concerned about how information could be promulgated, potentially an accurately.",,,
238,0.7998618483543396,1208.0,1218.2,"If for some reason, these recordings weren't fent weren't authentic and that, that inauthenticity wasn't found until it came to the court.",,,
239,0.7998618483543396,1218.2,1219.0,Does that make sense?,,,
240,0.7998618483543396,1219.3,1224.1,"Yep, so I desired that for the Department to have",,,
241,0.8950183391571045,1224.6,1228.9, some sort of process before it gets caught into the court system.,,,
242,0.752753496170044,1230.0,1241.2," Yes, I think I think the surveillance impact report was did speak to investigative procedures, but those aren't transparent necessarily and as to mr.",,,
243,0.752753496170044,1241.2,1250.1,"Maxie, I don't think the council can amend the surveillance impact report as that supposed to be documenting how the police department operates.",,,
244,0.752753496170044,1250.1,1255.0,And so we would potentially if you wanted to update this.,,,
245,0.752753496170044,1255.0,1257.5,"Or now, we might want to",,,
246,0.9128385782241821,1259.5,1264.1," I believe, I believe, um,",,,
247,0.8000617027282715,1266.4,1267.1, For convenience.,,,
248,0.8000617027282715,1267.1,1281.1,"I only have the ivi base SI are printed in front of me, but does the SAR for audio recordings respond to a concern by the working group on this matter?",,,
249,0.8000617027282715,1281.7,1282.1,No.,,,
250,0.9128385782241821,1285.8,1286.3, Okay.,,,
251,0.9128385782241821,1288.8,1290.3," well, in",,,
252,0.7812337279319763,1292.6,1306.0," what I heard saying councilmember her bold, you are saying that you want you want to understand that the working group wants to understand better these procedures before these come into investigation.",,,
253,0.7812337279319763,1307.4,1322.2,"Doesn't let these party the night before investigation, before SPD referred to sort of the inherent controls existent in the court process and the the limitations.",,,
254,0.860402524471283,1322.9,1327.3, Around getting warrants due process Etc.,,,
255,0.860402524471283,1327.6,1330.9,"But the, I think the request is about what?",,,
256,0.860402524471283,1330.9,1334.9,The internal processes are to SPD before.,,,
257,0.860402524471283,1335.3,1340.8,Those other legal processes are not so much before investigation.,,,
258,0.860402524471283,1340.8,1352.1,"But before before the sort of inherent controls of the legal system are sort of kick in, what are the policy based controls at the department has?",,,
259,0.8888034820556641,1352.4,1355.8, But I'm happy to withdraw this for now.,,,
260,0.8888034820556641,1356.4,1364.0,Sharon Nelson work with you on how to bring something something forward that I think better addresses.,,,
261,0.8888034820556641,1364.0,1366.3,Both of our questions about.,,,
262,0.8888034820556641,1366.3,1376.7,I appreciate that councilmember her bold and it last meeting I think that there was mentioned that it would be beneficial for this whole going forward.,,,
263,0.8888034820556641,1377.8,1382.2,It seems as though there could be better communication between the state.,,,
264,0.8810482025146484,1382.4,1383.2, Police department.,,,
265,0.8810482025146484,1383.2,1391.0,"And the working group, The working group does bring, you know, does take into account, the questions that are posed by members of the public.",,,
266,0.8810482025146484,1391.4,1406.9,"And so it just seems like if we could all sit around a table and some of these issues and SPD could perhaps explain a lot of the, the internal processes that that govern and limit their ability to use these Technologies.",,,
267,0.8810482025146484,1406.9,1412.2,And basically how do they launch an investigation and how our controls imposed by the court?,,,
268,0.8872877359390259,1412.3,1417.4," Maybe that would help going forward because it to my understanding there, a lot of the people.",,,
269,0.8872877359390259,1417.4,1420.2,There are seven members of the working group.,,,
270,0.8872877359390259,1420.2,1422.8,I think only four are impaneled right now.,,,
271,0.8872877359390259,1422.8,1430.8,"One is a representative from the ACLU, but I don't know how familiar the other members are of some of these Louise processes.",,,
272,0.8872877359390259,1430.8,1434.0,"So with that, thank you very much.",,,
273,0.8872877359390259,1434.0,1437.4,We'll put this amendment aside and let's move on to the next please.,,,

294,0.8234161138534546,1548.7,1551.7,We're speaking kind of broadly as,,,
295,0.8743581771850586,1551.8,1570.5," as it relates to the use of Biometrics and we're referring to the acquisition of technology that would allow the department to identify a person based on characteristics physical characteristics, which may include a person's fingerprints, DNA retina Voice or face.",,,

299,0.905856192111969,1581.7,1583.8, About belts and suspenders approach.,,,
300,0.905856192111969,1583.8,1593.9,"I think everybody, we all, we all agree that that, this this would be a separate technology under the surveillance ordinance.",,,
301,0.905856192111969,1593.9,1607.8,"The understanding is that SPD would have to come back and go through that process of developing a server for that, but much like we did on facial recognition technology.",,,
302,0.905856192111969,1607.8,1611.1,This in,,,
303,0.8199094533920288,1611.9,1617.4," With the co-sponsorship of council member Petersen, when this work was going through his committee.",,,
304,0.8199094533920288,1618.1,1623.5,We sort of took that belts and suspenders approach with facial recognition technology as well.,,,
305,0.8199094533920288,1623.7,1639.7,"In order to offer some assurances to community members, who sort of want the, the council to make that that extra statement above and beyond, just the recognition that these Technologies go through this process.",,,
306,0.6889638900756836,1641.6,1642.1, Thank you.,,,
307,0.8237063884735107,1646.8,1648.4," Well, mr.",,,
308,0.8237063884735107,1648.4,1648.9,Maxie.,,,
309,0.8931624889373779,1651.9,1654.6, So I think cats over her bold is corrected.,,,
310,0.8931624889373779,1654.6,1660.6,This is already part and parcel of the requirements of the surveillance ordinance self.,,,
311,0.8931624889373779,1660.6,1664.7,We could not acquire technology that allows us to do this absent.,,,
312,0.8931624889373779,1664.7,1668.3,Another tour of the surveillance ordinance that coming back to this body.,,,
313,0.8931624889373779,1668.3,1674.3,But I worry that some of the phrasing of this could have some unintended consequences.,,,
314,0.8931624889373779,1674.3,1679.7,"For example, we do, you know take DNA.",,,
315,0.8931624889373779,1679.7,1680.8,We do take fingerprints.,,,
316,0.8488987684249878,1683.2,1687.5, And we do have technology that's used to examine that DNA.,,,
317,0.8488987684249878,1687.5,1699.0,"And if that's part of the validation process of who the person that we are recording, you know, for example, if we had a room that we can't see into and we believe there's only one person in there.",,,
318,0.8488987684249878,1699.0,1708.3,"We could rely on DNA technology, their analysis to say the person that was in that room was so and so that corresponds to the voice that we're presenting to a court.",,,
319,0.8488987684249878,1708.5,1711.1,So it's not so much a technology.,,,
320,0.8488987684249878,1711.1,1711.8,It's more of an,,,
321,0.8221451640129089,1711.9,1716.5, - process that we discussed in the prior amendment.,,,
322,0.8221451640129089,1716.5,1718.4,That could be used to validate this.,,,
323,0.8221451640129089,1718.8,1721.9,"Similarly, The Voice, we do not have technology.",,,
324,0.8221451640129089,1721.9,1734.3,"That will compare voices, but we might have a prior recording of a person and then use that against the audio recording to validate that we have the correct person.",,,
325,0.8221451640129089,1734.6,1741.8,"So my understand when earlier than it was broad, I guess I failed to recognize it is.",,,
326,0.8689689636230469,1742.0,1744.3," Odd, as it relates to biometrics.",,,
327,0.9128386378288269,1745.8,1747.2, On or with.,,,
328,0.9128385782241821,1748.3,1750.0, The audio recording systems.,,,
329,0.8729678988456726,1753.8,1757.8, So it's related to particular technology.,,,
330,0.8729678988456726,1757.8,1758.2,Am I?,,,
331,0.8729678988456726,1758.4,1758.8,Is that?,,,
332,0.8729678988456726,1758.8,1759.9,"Is that correct, Lisa?",,,
333,0.8729678988456726,1760.8,1762.0,That is how it is written.,,,
334,0.8729678988456726,1762.0,1764.4,I think I think mr.,,,
335,0.8729678988456726,1764.4,1768.8,"Maxi is correct that there is some ambiguity there, in terms of",,,
336,0.8995916247367859,1771.0,1781.1," I think, I think the initial response that the department doesn't use Biometrics with this, probably was intended at the very high level.",,,
337,0.8995916247367859,1781.4,1797.0,"But in terms of when you get down to the actual analysis of how you're going to authenticate, or how you're looking at these recordings that it would be, it would seem that these, these analytical tools are, in fact, used is what I heard.",,,
338,0.8995916247367859,1797.0,1798.0,"Brian say, mr.",,,
339,0.8995916247367859,1798.0,1798.8,Maxie say.,,,
340,0.8487381339073181,1800.3,1801.2, Am I accurate there?,,,
341,0.8487381339073181,1801.6,1802.3,Mr. Maxie?,,,
342,0.8487381339073181,1802.3,1803.7,"Yeah, or they could be.",,,
343,0.8487381339073181,1803.7,1809.1,"Yes, and, you know, I think I fully understand the intent of this and I'm not in any way.",,,
344,0.8487381339073181,1809.1,1814.5,Speaking about that at just devil is always in the details and I just worry about collateral effects.,,,
345,0.7416707873344421,1816.3,1817.1, We have two great.,,,
346,0.7416707873344421,1818.5,1819.5,"No, go ahead, please.",,,
347,0.7416707873344421,1820.2,1822.3,I think that is a serious concern here.,,,
348,0.7416707873344421,1822.7,1835.4,"I'm not a lawyer, but I think there is some potential risk in in this amendment compromising current practice.",,,
349,0.7416707873344421,1835.7,1838.4,"If in fact, this was not ready for prime time either.",,,
350,0.7416707873344421,1839.0,1839.8,Apparently not.,,,
351,0.7416707873344421,1841.3,1841.5,All right.,,,
352,0.7416707873344421,1841.5,1845.9,"Well, at least we're using this time to Daylight these events.",,,
353,0.8790262341499329,1846.8,1847.3, Yes.,,,
354,0.8790262341499329,1847.6,1848.1,Okay.,,,
355,0.8790262341499329,1848.2,1848.8,Let's move on.,,,
356,0.8790262341499329,1851.2,1851.7,Captain Brett.,,,
357,0.8790262341499329,1851.7,1853.8,Did you want to add anything before we move on?,,,
358,0.8790262341499329,1854.7,1855.1,"No, ma'am.",,,
359,0.8790262341499329,1855.1,1856.3,Mr. Maxi Covergirl.,,,
360,0.8790262341499329,1856.3,1856.7,Thank you.,,,
361,0.8790262341499329,1857.0,1858.0,Thank you very much.,,,
362,0.8557006120681763,1861.3,1863.5," Okay, we're looking at amendment 3 right.",,,
363,0.8557006120681763,1863.5,1863.9,Now.,,,
364,0.8557006120681763,1864.2,1873.4,This would ask the police department to identify the manufacturers and vendors of the audio recording systems that are described in the surveillance impact report.,,,
365,0.8557006120681763,1873.9,1877.3,That would be approved by would be accepted by the council.,,,
366,0.8557006120681763,1877.7,1891.0,"And as was mentioned, that your first hearing Police Department prefers not to publicly disclose this information to avoid the risk of countermeasures in due to safety concerns for officers and cooperating Witnesses, I believe.",,,
367,0.901903510093689,1891.1,1899.5," Councilmember purple saw asking for manufacturers and vendors at a kind of a 30,000 foot level.",,,
368,0.901903510093689,1899.5,1902.0,As opposed to it's a level of specificity.,,,
369,0.901903510093689,1902.0,1906.8,That would be risky to the police officers.,,,
370,0.8404948115348816,1908.9,1912.1, Just a much more narrowly tailored.,,,
371,0.8404948115348816,1912.1,1921.2,"Ask that, hopefully does not have the same vulnerabilities that SPD had expressed concern with last time.",,,
372,0.8747795820236206,1926.0,1928.5, How is this a narrower ask?,,,
373,0.8747795820236206,1928.5,1933.4,It's only requesting the identity of the manufacturers and vendors?,,,
374,0.863869845867157,1935.4,1937.5, And nonspecific model names and numbers.,,,
375,0.863869845867157,1938.7,1940.6,"Okay, Captain Bray.",,,
376,0.863869845867157,1942.0,1942.5,"Thank you, ma'am.",,,
377,0.863869845867157,1942.6,1948.6,"And while I appreciate the council members efforts to, to broaden, the asked to to protect that.",,,
378,0.863869845867157,1949.1,1955.3,This request still has the potential to cause the same risks that were identified previously.,,,
379,0.863869845867157,1955.3,1964.5,Should a manufacturer or a vendor that is disclosed in this process have a limited number of devices or similarly operating devices.,,,
380,0.8919579386711121,1965.4,1976.2," It would still lay Us open for the potential for counter member countermeasures or dangers, to our cooperating Witnesses or our undercover officers that utilize this technology.",,,
381,0.8919579386711121,1976.4,1981.4,Isn't this information that would be disclosable under a public disclosure request.,,,
382,0.8919579386711121,1982.0,1984.9,It's just that would depend on the nature of the public disclosure request.,,,
383,0.8919579386711121,1984.9,1989.0,"The nature of the investigation involved and the decision of the judge, overseeing the case.",,,
384,0.8900337815284729,1989.8,1990.6, But I'll defer to Becca.,,,
385,0.8900337815284729,1990.6,1990.8,Boo.,,,
386,0.8900337815284729,1990.8,1991.4,"No, its not.",,,
387,0.8900337815284729,1991.4,1993.7,I'm not I'm not saying about a particular case.,,,
388,0.8900337815284729,1993.7,2003.5,"I'm saying the city makes a purchase and who you are doing, who you are making the purchase of from is public information.",,,
389,0.8900337815284729,2004.1,2005.2,"I'll defer to back about, right?",,,
390,0.8900337815284729,2005.2,2007.0,For the questions on the legality of disclosure.,,,
391,0.8952562212944031,2011.4,2012.0, Rebecca.,,,
392,0.9128382802009583,2021.2,2021.6, I'm sorry.,,,
393,0.9128382802009583,2021.6,2022.6,Could you repeat the question?,,,
394,0.9128382802009583,2023.7,2035.4,"The information requested in this amendment, simply the manufacturers and vendors of the purchased audio recording systems, that's public information.",,,
395,0.9128382802009583,2035.6,2036.2,Correct?,,,
396,0.9128382802009583,2037.3,2038.6,It completely depends.,,,
397,0.9128382802009583,2038.7,2047.1,"We would be providing, third-party notice to the vendor and the vendor would most likely intervene in the request.",,,
398,0.8475805521011353,2053.1,2056.2," Okay, back to my framing question.",,,
399,0.8475805521011353,2056.2,2063.1,How does the listing of the identities of the manufacturers and vendors of the recording systems?,,,
400,0.8475805521011353,2063.6,2067.9,Better protect the civil liberties and prevent against disparate impacts.,,,
401,0.8475805521011353,2068.6,2079.7,"I think the recent experience the city has had with accela is a really good example, why it's important the city to know who we're doing business with that particular.",,,

406,0.7720106840133667,2116.9,2119.4,Please raise your hand up high.,,,
407,0.7720106840133667,2119.5,2123.1,"Yeah, I just wanted to clarify I think counselor referring to a cyclic, huh?",,,
408,0.7720106840133667,2123.7,2127.0,A cell is another it platform that thank you.,,,
409,0.7720106840133667,2127.0,2127.6,Sorry.,,,

412,0.7720106840133667,2131.6,2141.3,"Yeah, I think you know with that in the working group has expressed concerns again about what devices are used a council member lnelson to kind of answer your question.",,,
413,0.7720106840133667,2141.3,2144.4,I think it helps them kind of,,,
414,0.8749394416809082,2144.9,2151.5," Together, if I'm understanding their perspective of what is presented and what is the capabilities of the technology to assess it?",,,
415,0.8749394416809082,2151.9,2157.1,"I think that being said, a lot of these Technologies regardless of manufacturer or vendor or kind of in the same.",,,
416,0.8749394416809082,2157.2,2159.4,"It's a microphone that records, right?",,,
417,0.8749394416809082,2159.4,2166.8,But I think the intent of that ask is to kind of validate that what are other options out there.,,,
418,0.8749394416809082,2166.8,2168.6,What devices are being used.,,,
419,0.8749394416809082,2168.6,2174.7,I think it's one of those wanting to verify and provide oversight is the is the reason behind,,,
420,0.8017685413360596,2174.8,2182.0," the ask, but I think that has to be balanced with spd's request that that information not be given due to potential countermeasures.",,,
421,0.8017685413360596,2182.0,2185.3,"So I think that's the real, the balancing question here.",,,
422,0.9128385782241821,2187.8,2188.3, Thank you.,,,
423,0.7893005609512329,2191.2,2208.6," Well, I am I am concerned about the potential of rendering the functionality of these devices moot, if people can find a workaround and figure out how not to be recorded.",,,
424,0.7893005609512329,2208.6,2220.8,"And so, that is the question that is driving me because all the as was mentioned before the some vendors, perhaps only make one product, so it would be fairly easy to get the",,,
425,0.8674393892288208,2221.0,2235.4," Sex on that product even if you don't even if, the more broad ask has been narrowed to Simply manufacturers and vendors and not make and model.",,,
426,0.8674393892288208,2235.4,2237.5,"For example, Omari.",,,
427,0.8100346326828003,2240.8,2242.1," Sorry, that was my hand still up.",,,
428,0.9128385782241821,2247.1,2247.6, Okay.,,,
429,0.8921580910682678,2253.3,2260.3," I if there are no other comments, I will now move.",,,
430,0.8921580910682678,2260.3,2261.1,This amendment.,,,
431,0.8921580910682678,2261.1,2263.2,Is that what I am supposed to do here?,,,
432,0.8921580910682678,2263.7,2264.4,I'm sorry.,,,
433,0.8921580910682678,2264.4,2266.2,I thought we were going through all of them.,,,
434,0.8921580910682678,2266.2,2266.6,Okay.,,,
435,0.8921580910682678,2266.6,2268.9,Go through all of them that's easier for me.,,,
436,0.8921580910682678,2269.0,2270.2,That's way easier for me.,,,
437,0.8921580910682678,2270.3,2271.4,"Okay, great.",,,
438,0.8921580910682678,2271.6,2273.3,And I think there's just one more in this Bill.,,,
439,0.8921580910682678,2275.1,2276.8,"Yes, okay.",,,
440,0.8680191040039062,2277.8,2281.3, So we will move now to amendment number four.,,,
441,0.8377024531364441,2283.8,2299.3," This amendment is similar to all the Amendments passed for previous surveillance, impact reports, which also omitted to provide metrics to the chief technology officer for that offices, use in annual Equity assessments.",,,
442,0.8377024531364441,2299.3,2305.3,"So, this amendment would ask the police department to provide those metrics to the clerk by the end of this year.",,,
443,0.9125368595123291,2307.5,2335.1," Thank you, Lisa, yeah, so this is just again, this follows the requirements that we have included on reporting on the metrics that they use for, for annual Equity assessments that they already do, they're required to do and it just is replicates the Amendments that we have.",,,
444,0.8826062679290771,2336.1,2341.7, Included in the sirs for a previous Technologies approved by the council.,,,
445,0.8826062679290771,2341.7,2344.2,So just it's a template Amendment.,,,
446,0.8826062679290771,2344.2,2346.2,Hopefully not a big deal.,,,
447,0.9128093719482422,2351.1,2354.5, I have not looked at those other sirs.,,,
448,0.9128093719482422,2354.5,2364.5,"So, could somebody please speak to whether or not you could just use the other, the other metrics for this technology, for this group of Technologies?",,,
449,0.9128093719482422,2365.3,2374.4,"I think if I may Madam chair, the issue is that the sir has a number of questions that the Department's answer.",,,
450,0.9128093719482422,2374.7,2379.1,One of the questions is what will be the metrics that you're going to give this Chief technology officer.,,,
451,0.8677317500114441,2379.4,2384.3," So they know how to measure the equity, impacts of your particular device.",,,
452,0.8677317500114441,2384.8,2390.6,Those metrics have never been provided in any of the servers that have come to council to date.,,,
453,0.8677317500114441,2390.9,2400.5,I think Omari explain this in a previous iteration that the departments were kind of waiting to see what the council was going to do before they provided those metrics.,,,
454,0.8677317500114441,2401.9,2409.1,"And so the council has kind of provided a nudge each time saying, we really would like you to give the metrics so that the",,,
455,0.8278935551643372,2409.2,2412.8, the Ctrl knows how to do their assessment.,,,
456,0.8940705060958862,2416.1,2444.6," So basically, are we trying to get at whether or not the use of this technology is used more often in investigations, in which a particular group of people are being investigated compared to another group of people is that because this is, we're looking at technology and use during an investigation.",,,
457,0.8940705060958862,2444.6,2444.9,"So,",,,
458,0.8576410412788391,2445.1,2449.4, That is the is that the pool that we're looking at to apply the metrics to?,,,
459,0.7200849056243896,2451.0,2452.1," Yes, and you'll see.",,,
460,0.7200849056243896,2452.1,2455.3,"I mean, the, the CTO has done Equity assessments.",,,
461,0.7200849056243896,2455.3,2460.9,I believed to date of one or two of those surveillance Technologies already.,,,
462,0.7200849056243896,2461.3,2464.2,I made ask Omari to speak a little bit more to that.,,,
463,0.7200849056243896,2464.2,2477.8,"But yes, it's basically broadly looking at any day that they can track in terms of disproportionate civil liberties impacts from the use of these Technologies.",,,
464,0.7200849056243896,2478.5,2478.9,Okay.,,,
465,0.7200849056243896,2478.9,2480.6,"America, you had your hand up first.",,,
466,0.9045672416687012,2480.7,2481.0, Is.,,,
467,0.9045672416687012,2481.0,2485.0,"Yeah, so I can speak a little bit more to the the equity of magic.",,,
468,0.9045672416687012,2485.0,2496.1,"So by the ordinance, the ctOS required every year by September 15th, to submit the surveillance technology Community Equity impact assessment and policy.",,,
469,0.9045672416687012,2496.1,2496.9,Guidance report.,,,
470,0.9045672416687012,2496.9,2499.5,We call it the equity impact assessment for short.,,,
471,0.9045672416687012,2499.5,2507.5,"And essentially, we're we have a couple of things that were looking at in that one of them is an inviting waiting of the ordinance.",,,
472,0.9045672416687012,2507.5,2510.5,"In this process, if we're meeting the city's racial social justice and",,,
473,0.7864631414413452,2510.7,2512.1," Circles, as well.",,,
474,0.7864631414413452,2512.1,2518.3,As looking at any communities or groups in the city are disproportionately impacted by the use of these Technologies.,,,
475,0.7864631414413452,2519.1,2523.3,As for an addition to what adjustments we should make to the law and any new approaches.,,,
476,0.7864631414413452,2523.3,2525.6,We should consider in these reviews.,,,
477,0.7864631414413452,2526.1,2532.9,We also consult with the working group as a part of that they get a draft and they provide feedback and recommendations on it.,,,
478,0.7864631414413452,2533.4,2540.6,I think the idea is these amendments and the server provides an opportunity for departments to provide to,,,
479,0.823691725730896,2540.9,2546.0, The metrics under which we will evaluate them by as kind of an oversight function.,,,
480,0.823691725730896,2546.5,2563.3,"So this is kind of how the the equity measurement is baked into the ordinance because we, the CTO is required to take a look at that every year and see, you know, are there disproportionate usage patterns and some of these Technologies are given the wide range of Technologies.",,,
481,0.823691725730896,2563.4,2564.8,The different use cases.,,,
482,0.823691725730896,2564.9,2570.6,We rely on the Department's to give us that information as far as what makes sense as far as,,,
483,0.7359945178031921,2570.7,2575.2," As you know, tracking deployments, for example, with a cyclical desktop system.",,,
484,0.7359945178031921,2575.6,2579.4,"Those were kind of we used peanut butter around the city, right?",,,
485,0.7359945178031921,2579.4,2583.7,So there may be the question about Equity is where are you deploying it versus?,,,
486,0.7359945178031921,2583.7,2585.4,Who are you using it with?,,,
487,0.7359945178031921,2585.4,2585.5,Right?,,,
488,0.7359945178031921,2585.5,2590.7,So there are different measurements or dimensions of equity that we want to look at.,,,
489,0.7359945178031921,2590.7,2593.9,And I think this is just giving the department the opportunity.,,,
490,0.7359945178031921,2594.1,2598.0,Since these are used in investigations.,,,
491,0.7359945178031921,2598.0,2600.6,I would imagine the pool of the,,,
492,0.8314476013183594,2600.7,2605.7, I think that folks that are would be used on this are the same folks that are under investigation.,,,
493,0.8314476013183594,2605.7,2607.8,But all that SPD speak to that more.,,,
494,0.6883710622787476,2610.2,2612.4, Mr. Maxi and Brian.,,,
495,0.9072392582893372,2613.6,2624.9," Yeah, so I you know, we are always interested in exploring the impacts of our operations and activities under the Christian social justice lens to we have no objections to this.",,,
496,0.9072392582893372,2627.5,2628.9,"This, this amendment.",,,
497,0.9072392582893372,2629.4,2641.8,"It does, it mean it is difficult, especially in the world of policing to accurately, come up with metrics to analyze this that's that legitimately assesses.",,,
498,0.9072392582893372,2641.8,2643.2,"The impact of this to, what am I?",,,
499,0.7743913531303406,2643.4,2648.5," Just said, you know, the N are sorry.",,,
500,0.7743913531303406,2648.5,2657.6,The denominator in this case would likely be individuals where we have probable cause to investigate or Reasonable Suspicion to investigate.,,,
501,0.7743913531303406,2657.8,2659.1,That would be your denominator.,,,
502,0.7743913531303406,2659.1,2662.8,And then within the pool of that of that group.,,,
503,0.7743913531303406,2663.3,2671.0,Is there a disproportionate use of this technology on any demographic or certain group?,,,
504,0.7743913531303406,2671.6,2672.6,So that would be a,,,
505,0.8474270105361938,2673.3,2695.7," I think a narrowly tailored metric overlaid on top of our general investigations metric and we will have to dig a Little Deeper to find out what what we have in our investigation files to create that denominator, but certainly by December, we can provide the metrics and the plan to assess the, the equity of this technology.",,,
506,0.8474270105361938,2696.5,2703.2,"I'm also hurting to here, and I just wanted to confirm that, you know, this, this type of amendment is going to all departments.",,,
507,0.8261898756027222,2703.4,2717.9," Not just the Seattle Police Department because as we know if we've talked about race and data quite frequently in the public sphere, you know, I went to data dot, Seattle, dot-gov to find out what other departments provide race data.",,,
508,0.8261898756027222,2718.3,2727.4,"And I was unable to find any other department, other than Seattle, Police Department that puts that information out publicly undated on Seattle dot-gov, so I'm heartened to hear that.",,,
509,0.8261898756027222,2727.4,2730.6,This is being equally applied and we have no problem with it.,,,

618,0.7778270244598389,3167.4,3171.2,So this is an amendment to council Bill one 2309.,,,
619,0.7778270244598389,3171.8,3176.5,That would approve IBM's eye to eye base link analysis software.,,,
620,0.7778270244598389,3176.5,3182.0,"So, it would prove that ongoing use of this and accept the surveillance impact report as you heard.",,,

627,0.9128386378288269,3213.3,3215.8,Trying to shrink it on the screen so that it will all show up.,,,
628,0.9128386378288269,3216.7,3217.2,Okay?,,,
629,0.8759369254112244,3220.3,3232.3," Limit one would ask the police department to report by January 31st of next year, on data and records retention policies and our guidelines that are applicable to the use and the operation of this technology.",,,

631,0.8759369254112244,3247.4,3248.5,"After the retention, period.",,,
632,0.7221114635467529,3248.7,3249.7, Expired.,,,
633,0.7221114635467529,3250.8,3255.3,"And you heard during your first meeting, that Police Department retains manually added data.",,,
634,0.7221114635467529,3256.0,3265.8,"After five years, which is really the federal maximum requirement the state law enforcement records retention schedule for intelligence files.",,,
635,0.7221114635467529,3265.8,3274.4,"For example, requires our attention until no longer needed for agency business, but federal law allows for retention period of up to five years.",,,
636,0.7221114635467529,3274.8,3277.1,"So, a speedy apply.",,,
637,0.7221114635467529,3277.1,3278.5,Is that five-year period too?,,,
638,0.6388325095176697,3278.6,3280.0, All manually entered data.,,,
639,0.8920574188232422,3282.7,3284.6, That concludes my overview.,,,
640,0.9041308760643005,3286.6,3289.0," Councilmember horrible, would you like to stay for you?",,,
641,0.9041308760643005,3289.1,3293.0,"Sure, and I thought, and I really apologize.",,,
642,0.9041308760643005,3293.0,3302.2,"If that was your, if your intent in the first piece of legislation was for us to take in vote, on each of eminent as they come.",,,
643,0.9041308760643005,3302.4,3303.8,And I'm happy to do it that way.,,,
644,0.9041308760643005,3304.1,3314.4,"I thought I heard that was in your instructions for this bill that you wanted to vote on Amendment here, Amendment one from Lisa K, and then vote on it and then move to the next one.",,,
645,0.9041308760643005,3314.4,3314.8,So that,,,
646,0.824347198009491,3318.4,3320.1," I believe, is that the process?",,,
647,0.824347198009491,3320.1,3322.3,We just went through went well.,,,
648,0.824347198009491,3323.2,3324.9,"So, why don't we continue with that?",,,
649,0.824347198009491,3324.9,3326.2,"Okay, perfect.",,,
650,0.824347198009491,3326.3,3326.9,Thank you so much.,,,
651,0.824347198009491,3326.9,3336.7,"So in that case, I'd like to just allow Lisa to just go through the Amendments and I'll speak to them when I move them.",,,
652,0.824347198009491,3336.8,3337.4,That's okay.,,,
653,0.8825172185897827,3340.4,3341.5," Sure, I do.",,,
654,0.8825172185897827,3341.6,3346.5,"I just want to repeat myself, but let's not get too far away.",,,
655,0.8825172185897827,3346.5,3351.9,So I guess I will ask a specific question about this because,,,
656,0.9109317064285278,3354.3,3355.9, This particular one while we're on it.,,,
657,0.9109317064285278,3356.8,3363.8,"So the question is, will records be retained for five years maximum or three years maximum.",,,
658,0.9109317064285278,3363.8,3383.5,"And what I've been trying to understand is to what extent will retaining, the, the records for less amount of time, have negative impacts on continuing cases or appeals and",,,
659,0.856476366519928,3383.7,3387.0," So, that is what I have asked, Seattle Police Department about.",,,
660,0.856476366519928,3387.9,3388.6,In other words.,,,
661,0.856476366519928,3389.0,3392.2,Does this put the city at additional exposure?,,,
662,0.856476366519928,3392.2,3410.3,"If those records are no longer available, if the city is trying to defend ourselves or or Aiden in, in defending, a suspect that was subject to these investigation.",,,
663,0.856476366519928,3410.3,3412.9,So can the amendment doesn't,,,
664,0.9072621464729309,3413.6,3418.8, doesn't promulgate a particular written records retention policy.,,,
665,0.9072621464729309,3418.8,3424.6,"It asks it simply asks, what the records retention policy is.",,,
666,0.9072621464729309,3424.6,3443.4,"It says the report identifies a retention policy that complies with the minimum retention period Allowed by state law and federal law, but but also includes a clear deletion oversight process to",,,
667,0.8754760026931763,3443.6,3449.9," Your deletion of manually added data after their specific specified, retention period.",,,
668,0.8754760026931763,3451.7,3458.2,"So, I mean, it speaks to both the minimum retention period Allowed by state and federal law.",,,
669,0.8921768069267273,3460.2,3460.8, Okay.,,,
670,0.8921768069267273,3461.3,3461.8,SPD.,,,
671,0.8921768069267273,3461.8,3464.1,What would be the real-life impact of this?,,,
672,0.8022403717041016,3469.4,3478.4, so I guess I'll jump in first gear and let Captain Britt clean up anything I say and there's a couple things in play here one is,,,
673,0.8139628767967224,3479.5,3492.7," When we generated an eye to eye base, link analysis that is associated with the underlying investigative file and the retention for that document would track with whatever the investigation is.",,,
674,0.8139628767967224,3493.1,3497.4,"So for example, homicide cases, there can be maintained in perpetuity.",,,
675,0.8139628767967224,3497.4,3501.6,"So if this was a homicide case, we would, it would track with that.",,,
676,0.8139628767967224,3501.6,3508.6,"If it were something else, it would track within the retention for that type of case, so,",,,
677,0.8981611132621765,3508.7,3519.0," This request is, I understand it is for us to identify what the retention policies are and present that back to exactly the clerk.",,,
678,0.8981611132621765,3519.0,3520.7,And I see no problem doing that.,,,
679,0.8981611132621765,3520.7,3529.0,It and I don't see this as mandatory that it comply with minimum retention periods.,,,
680,0.8981611132621765,3529.0,3536.5,I see that there's a value that's been put in there but it does not appear to be mandatory and certainly the feasibility.,,,
681,0.8981611132621765,3536.5,3538.7,I'm assuming the little legitimate law enforcement.,,,
682,0.9128382205963135,3538.8,3543.7, Horsemen interests involved in that would go into the feasibility determination there.,,,
683,0.9128382205963135,3544.2,3555.3,"If I'm if I'm reading the operative language is the reference to state law that retention should be until no longer needed for agency business, which you get to Define.",,,
684,0.9128382205963135,3556.3,3556.5,Yeah.,,,
685,0.9128382205963135,3556.5,3563.3,"So if that's the request, I don't see a problem with us spelling this out and being and and identifying what we're doing.",,,
686,0.9128382205963135,3563.8,3564.9,That's a fair request.,,,
687,0.8179785013198853,3569.0,3570.0, All right.,,,
688,0.8179785013198853,3570.5,3572.0,"Let's go on to the next one, please.",,,
689,0.8267308473587036,3573.2,3573.5, Thank you.,,,
690,0.8267308473587036,3573.5,3573.8,Madam.,,,
691,0.8267308473587036,3573.8,3585.6,"Chair amendment 2 would ask the police department to report by October 31st of this year, when the number of incidents over the each of the past, three years, for which this software was deployed.",,,
692,0.8968305587768555,3589.8,3597.4, I think the only thing I have to add on that is that this is recommendation 12 from the working group.,,,
693,0.8968305587768555,3597.7,3617.4,"It is not an issue addressed in the sir, and it is been requested because of a belief that it is important to under for the public to understand how this technology is being used and the number of incidents per year again, this data would bury its data, it's not",,,
694,0.9128386378288269,3618.3,3623.0, Not personally identifying data and it would be governed by public disclosure laws.,,,
695,0.9128386378288269,3623.0,3623.5,Anyhow.,,,
696,0.826774001121521,3625.7,3643.3," Okay, so to remind people and I think that perhaps a description of the technology is warranted here because this, my understanding is that I base is allows the department to see linkages.",,,
697,0.826774001121521,3643.7,3644.2,It does.,,,
698,0.826774001121521,3644.6,3648.7,I base is not a technology that actually captures information.,,,
699,0.826774001121521,3648.7,3653.2,"From individuals or transmits, it excetera.",,,
700,0.826774001121521,3653.2,3654.8,So I,,,
701,0.8329319953918457,3656.1,3666.9, It's kind of like a it allows for officers to see the relationships between individuals and in previous cases.,,,
702,0.8329319953918457,3666.9,3667.5,Etc.,,,
703,0.8329319953918457,3667.5,3671.1,"So, can you please speak to in general?",,,
704,0.8329319953918457,3671.1,3672.5,How often it is used?,,,
705,0.8329319953918457,3672.5,3674.7,And would it be easy to get that information?,,,
706,0.8329319953918457,3674.8,3678.4,"I mean, would it be easy to report on that information the number of incidents?",,,
707,0.9112654328346252,3684.8,3687.4, So I'll go ahead and speak to that.,,,
708,0.9112654328346252,3687.6,3692.6,This isn't something that we would be readily able to provide the number of incidents per year.,,,
709,0.9112654328346252,3695.1,3701.8,"It's a matter of, if you run one eye to eye base link analysis, it could link to 32 incidents.",,,
710,0.9112654328346252,3701.8,3710.0,It could like the example that was shown in Council last last session was 17 incidents related to one link analysis.,,,
711,0.9112654328346252,3710.4,3712.0,"Once again, like the councilmember stated.",,,
712,0.9112654328346252,3712.0,3713.7,This doesn't create.,,,
713,0.8658798336982727,3715.1,3715.8, A data set.,,,
714,0.8658798336982727,3715.8,3718.7,"This simply, analyzes data that already exists.",,,
715,0.8658798336982727,3718.7,3727.4,So this would be akin to asking us how often we put together a PowerPoint presentation because all that is displaying the data that's already there.,,,
716,0.8658798336982727,3727.4,3733.4,So this isn't something that we would be prepared at this moment to provide for the last three years.,,,
717,0.8658798336982727,3733.4,3737.5,So it's something that we would need to affirmatively start to track.,,,
718,0.8246096968650818,3738.8,3753.3," And it would be to withdraw this one to discuss further with the working group, the data set that can be analyzed that perhaps would satisfy the transparency request here.",,,
719,0.8246096968650818,3754.8,3763.1,"If not, if not incidents, what I'm happy to take, take this amendment back to them for additional refinement.",,,

721,0.8221887350082397,3765.8,3766.3,We should pack.,,,

761,0.8059874176979065,3947.7,3969.6,"This amendment would request that the supplemental budget includes funding for an independent evaluation on the risks associated with, I based Technologies, including the risks to civil liberties data, accuracy, and accuracy, the linkages that the system identifies the cost of such an assessment is around 100 thousand dollars similar with other.",,,

763,0.7061680555343628,3980.6,3993.0,"I think that it is an important to have this assessment as any assessment would be overseen by the Inspector General for Public Safety, even though it is completed by an independent consultant.",,,
764,0.7061680555343628,3993.0,3999.6,"I recognize that this request would require funding in a difficult budget year, and my Amendment would not prohibit the use of",,,
765,0.7620404958724976,3999.7,4007.3, This technology only make it clear that the assessment is needed and that we should work to fund it while there will be a small physical impact.,,,
766,0.7620404958724976,4007.5,4009.4,If we're able to secure funding for such a risk.,,,

768,0.7620404958724976,4016.0,4018.1,I don't necessarily think that's going to happen.,,,

771,0.8475467562675476,4031.5,4032.7,That risk is worthwhile.,,,
772,0.7492408156394958,4035.3,4043.4," That's I think that is worth while I mean, and at the end of the day, if it prevents prosecution's based on faulty information, that's that's money.",,,
773,0.7492408156394958,4043.4,4044.2,Well spent.,,,

784,0.894194483757019,4074.7,4100.0,"I'm one of my questions is after passage of the S IR s--, then it's now on their plate to to evaluate for a year or three the deployment of these Technologies and they take into account a lot of the, I think the questions that that we've been talking about now disparate impacts and so on.",,,
785,0.894194483757019,4100.0,4102.2,So would this be,,,
786,0.7300707101821899,4102.8,4103.3, They do.,,,
787,0.7300707101821899,4103.3,4106.8,They just start doing that work until this consultant report is finished.,,,
788,0.7300707101821899,4106.8,4109.3,Can you describe the mechanics of how this will work?,,,
789,0.7300707101821899,4110.2,4110.3,Yeah.,,,
790,0.7300707101821899,4110.3,4117.6,It's my understanding that report would be overseen by the Inspector General and completed by listing the party consultant.,,,
791,0.9128385782241821,4118.7,4119.1, Okay.,,,
792,0.8690178394317627,4121.1,4121.6, Got it.,,,
793,0.8690178394317627,4122.7,4127.4,Are there any comments from the from the Department?,,,
794,0.8690178394317627,4130.6,4137.6,"So II did have one eye base links, different investigations.",,,
795,0.8690178394317627,4137.6,4147.6,"So if data is entered into a case as we were presented, last time someone in Kent, but the bullets were found in Seattle.",,,
796,0.8690178394317627,4147.6,4149.2,"I mean, would they would?",,,
797,0.8690178394317627,4149.3,4150.2,I'm just wondering.,,,
798,0.8048846125602722,4151.3,4152.0, With day.,,,
799,0.8048846125602722,4152.0,4164.0,"Also, with this consultant, report also verify the, the processes by which and the accuracy of by which data is input into cases, in other jurisdictions.",,,
800,0.8283872008323669,4165.6,4167.7, I've been coming from only question before.,,,
801,0.8283872008323669,4171.7,4174.5,"And, you know, what, I can tell you is that growing up.",,,
802,0.8283872008323669,4174.5,4178.6,There were two people in the city of Seattle with my name and with my father's name.,,,
803,0.8283872008323669,4178.8,4181.3,I would regularly receive mail for that person.,,,
804,0.8283872008323669,4181.7,4194.9,"My father would regularly receive mail for the other person, you know, knew this was in a day day and age where things were a little bit more simple in this day, and age was so many levels of Technology being able to connect.",,,
805,0.8215495944023132,4195.6,4197.1, I think mr.,,,
806,0.8215495944023132,4197.1,4212.0,"Maxi described it at the last meeting is if you see those old detective videos of linking, you know, pictures on a long linking with the string from each thing to another in a, in the world where technology is now.",,,
807,0.8215495944023132,4212.0,4213.5,Doing that for us.,,,
808,0.8215495944023132,4213.7,4223.7,I do think that it is important that we have independent evaluation to ensure that we're not making the old mistakes that I had described about having two people with the same name.,,,
809,0.8497180342674255,4225.0,4228.7," Or or anything else, but the scope of the evaluation.",,,
810,0.8497180342674255,4228.9,4232.6,"I think that that is iterative and if you have input, I think it would be welcome.",,,
811,0.9119845032691956,4235.5,4238.3, Point taken and just try being Sarah Nelson.,,,
812,0.9119845032691956,4242.6,4243.1,Okay.,,,
813,0.9119845032691956,4243.4,4244.4,Councilmember up.,,,
814,0.9119845032691956,4245.1,4247.4,You've got both Omari and Brian.,,,
815,0.9119845032691956,4247.4,4248.3,Have their hands raised.,,,
816,0.9119845032691956,4248.3,4250.8,And I have a comment that I could if needed.,,,
817,0.9119845032691956,4250.8,4253.5,"Okay, if neither of them speak to what I was going to say.",,,
818,0.7927331924438477,4254.8,4258.8," Okay, I do not know if if Brian or Amari was first.",,,
819,0.7927331924438477,4258.8,4261.6,"So could the person who had their hand up first, please speak.",,,
820,0.7927331924438477,4263.6,4265.3,I'm not sure fine.,,,
821,0.7927331924438477,4265.3,4265.8,You can join.,,,
822,0.7927331924438477,4266.3,4266.9,"Oh, you go.",,,
823,0.7927331924438477,4266.9,4268.4,"You were first, I'm certain.",,,
824,0.7927331924438477,4268.7,4281.4,"All right, so I just wanted to point out more of a comment than a question or maybe both just wanting to flag for the the committee that the oig does do audits on a regular basis.",,,
825,0.7927331924438477,4281.4,4284.0,They were I think they weren't supposed to be on a yearly basis.,,,
826,0.7792773842811584,4284.9,4298.3," If they haven't been, I don't know if they were consulted in the drafting of this, but I think just making sure that that can online with maybe their audit for that year or just kind of working that into their schedule for their annual audits.",,,
827,0.7792773842811584,4298.3,4300.8,I just wanted to flag that as a potential concern here.,,,
828,0.7961822152137756,4302.8,4303.7, I appreciate that.,,,
829,0.7961822152137756,4303.7,4317.2,"And that was a more eloquent way of basically saying that I was trying to say and right now they are, they're charged with annual Audits.",,,
830,0.7961822152137756,4317.6,4328.2,"And I do know that they have expressed that they're staffing needs, make that difficult, but making sure that they are in alignment, I think is important.",,,
831,0.7961822152137756,4328.6,4328.9,Okay?,,,
832,0.7961822152137756,4330.1,4330.8,All right.,,,
833,0.7692723870277405,4332.7,4333.2, Brian.,,,
834,0.7776349782943726,4335.5,4342.1," Oh, you know, I we didn't speak up earlier because it's not really our place to say what the oig should be doing.",,,
835,0.7776349782943726,4342.1,4347.3,We accept the have unfettered access to our systems for efficient oversight.,,,
836,0.7776349782943726,4347.4,4350.9,I just in hearing the description of this though.,,,
837,0.7776349782943726,4351.7,4365.1,"It sounds like this is almost an audit of our investigations rather than an audit of the use of this technology because when we create links between entities in eye, to eye base, I mean, that is based.",,,
838,0.9128383994102478,4365.3,4378.2," On investigation and belief that there is a link there and then that gets explored and if they link use is accurate, then it was maintained and if it's not it will it'll be decoupled.",,,
839,0.9128383994102478,4378.7,4395.0,"So there's a whole host of investigative processes that go or go along with this and to the question about integrating information from other jurisdictions, you know, certainly, you know, we may be bringing information that other jurisdictions provide.",,,
840,0.831010639667511,4395.2,4411.7," And I know we think about this in terms of people entities, but keep in mind, this also deals with, you know, locations, not even shell, casing analysis, and there's a whole host of things that gets connected within this system.",,,
841,0.831010639667511,4411.7,4416.1,"So, this is not just about people and the civil liberties that track with it.",,,
842,0.831010639667511,4416.1,4417.0,It does have that.,,,
843,0.831010639667511,4417.0,4418.7,"So, that is certainly a component.",,,
844,0.831010639667511,4418.7,4425.1,"So, my concern here is, you know, whether this becomes an audit of the investigation, writ large or whether we are trying to",,,
845,0.9043658971786499,4425.3,4428.0, The use of this technology in investigations.,,,
846,0.8012841939926147,4433.4,4434.4, Strauss is raising his hand.,,,
847,0.8012841939926147,4434.5,4434.7,Yes.,,,
848,0.8012841939926147,4434.7,4435.4,I see that.,,,
849,0.8012841939926147,4436.4,4437.6,"Thank you, Jerry Nelson.",,,
850,0.8012841939926147,4438.3,4439.0,And thank you.,,,
851,0.8012841939926147,4439.2,4441.2,Mr. Maxie for that clarification.,,,
852,0.8012841939926147,4441.2,4446.1,"And from our regular meetings, with investigations and talking about investigations.",,,
853,0.8012841939926147,4446.1,4458.6,"I don't think that's the intent to audit your investigations Department, rather that how this technology is being used the capabilities of it and ensuring that it's, it is protecting civil liberties.",,,
854,0.8012841939926147,4458.6,4459.3,And I do see this.,,,
855,0.8012841939926147,4459.3,4462.5,As with this third party accountability as is,,,
856,0.8659154176712036,4462.7,4473.5," Protecting SPD from any on warmth and criticisms if or daylighting, you know vulnerabilities that we need to work to protect.",,,
857,0.9122570157051086,4476.1,4476.6, Thank you.,,,
858,0.9122570157051086,4477.1,4480.0,"Lisa, did you want to say anything you had your hand up?",,,
859,0.9122570157051086,4480.0,4492.2,"Way back when Brian did speak to my question about looking at external agencies, I think in terms of oig's work capacity, that is probably a reasonable question.",,,
860,0.9122570157051086,4492.5,4503.6,"The reason this was structured in a way to have oig hire, an outside consultant is, is multi-pronged, one was to minimize the impact on their workload because they are very busy.",,,
861,0.9122570157051086,4503.9,4505.4,The second is recognizing that this,,,
862,0.9128384590148926,4505.6,4517.3," What is going into a level of depth beyond what they would be doing in their annual reports and would require, probably a lot more subject matter, expertise on behalf of the consultant?",,,
863,0.9128384590148926,4517.3,4518.9,Who would be doing it then?,,,
864,0.9128384590148926,4518.9,4521.6,Perhaps they would be doing with their annual reports.,,,
865,0.9128384590148926,4523.7,4524.0,Okay.,,,
866,0.9128384590148926,4524.0,4535.4,"Well, operationally, I'm wondering and I don't have an opinion here, but is it possible to to change this amendment before we vote on this legislation?",,,
867,0.75380939245224,4535.5,4542.8, Ation in full Council so that it's not as broad as as Brian was talking about.,,,
868,0.75380939245224,4542.8,4552.4,"But that it still gets into protecting the live, the civil liberties of the people surfaced in the deployment of I base.",,,
869,0.75380939245224,4552.6,4553.9,Is that a good way to go.,,,
870,0.75380939245224,4555.1,4558.3,"So you have you have two options, at least your one.",,,
871,0.75380939245224,4558.3,4565.4,"You could amend this in committee right now, you can put a period after civil liberties risks, and then you would have",,,
872,0.7958362698554993,4565.6,4570.3, The word specificity there with an amendment to the amendment.,,,
873,0.7958362698554993,4570.7,4588.6,"Otherwise you if the committee chose to pass this, the way it is now a council member could bring an amendment to counsel and have have that considered by the full Council, councilmember Strauss, Jerry Nelson and Brian.",,,
874,0.7958362698554993,4588.6,4591.4,"Definitely, you know, feel free to jump in here with due respect.",,,
875,0.7958362698554993,4591.4,4595.3,I do think that this amendment specifies that we are looking at the,,,
876,0.7993311882019043,4595.5,4606.4," The IBM I to base link analysis software that I don't see in this amendment anywhere, requesting, and an audit of Investigations.",,,
877,0.7993311882019043,4607.7,4611.4,I think that this is Well written as it stands.,,,
878,0.7993311882019043,4611.4,4613.7,I don't necessarily see us needing to change it.,,,
879,0.7993311882019043,4613.7,4624.9,I think that our conversation may have taken us in different ways in different tangents and directions because we're having a larger conversation than what's written on a piece of paper.,,,
880,0.8816513419151306,4631.2,4631.8, Okay.,,,
881,0.8816513419151306,4631.8,4634.3,So Brian.,,,
882,0.8816513419151306,4635.5,4646.9,"And we very specifically the language that I'm squinting at here is the line that says, the accuracy of linkages identified, by users of IBM eye to eye base software.",,,
