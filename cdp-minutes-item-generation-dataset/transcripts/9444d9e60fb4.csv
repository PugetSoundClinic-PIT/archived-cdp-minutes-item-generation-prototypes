3,0.97,97.096,102.469,This is a special scheduled meeting of the Sustainability and Renters' rights committee of the Seattle city council.,0,,
4,0.97,102.469,108.041,The time is 6:03 P.M.,0,,
5,0.97,108.041,112.679,"On January 23, Thursday, January 23, 2020.",0,,
6,0.97,112.679,119.886,I'm joined by Council members Morales and Lewis and I'm Council member Sawant of the Seattle city council.,0,,
7,0.97,119.886,128.361,So first of all I have to--if there are no objections approve the agenda.,0,,
8,0.97,128.361,129.295,No objection.,1,,
9,0.97,129.295,130.163,Thank you.,2,,
10,0.97,130.163,133.266,"Hearing no objection, the agenda is approved.",2,,
11,0.97,133.266,143.776,"In today's meeting, we will discuss, consider amendments and vote on the ordinance that my office has produced to ban most winter Evictions in our city.",2,,
12,0.97,143.776,150.216,Last November the city of Seattle Renters' Commission recommended Council take up this urgent issue.,2,,
13,0.97,150.216,154.888,They pointed out that winter Evictions are especially cruel and harmful.,2,,
14,0.97,154.888,164.397,"In 2018 the Seattle women's Commission and the King County bar Association jointly issued a study, losing home, the human cost of Eviction in Seattle.",2,,
15,0.97,164.397,172.438,This study found that nearly 90% of people evicted become homeless and that people of color were disproportionately evicted.,2,,
16,0.97,172.438,185.118,In fact black tenants experienced Eviction at a rate of 4.5 times based on what was expected in their demographics of Seattle according to the study.,2,,
17,0.97,185.118,186.886,Most tenants are evicted for not paying rent.,2,,
18,0.97,186.886,193.459,In most cases the study found evicted tenants owed one month or less in rent.,2,,
19,0.97,193.459,201.534,In one case the tenant Wasevicted for owing $10.,2,,
20,0.97,201.534,206.839,One was evicted for failing to pay $2 in outstanding rent.,2,,
21,0.97,206.839,208.942,You cannot make this stuff up.,2,,
22,0.97,208.942,233.266,"There is an article in the Seattle times from as part of their project homeless where they kill Kilani's situation and because she had legal representation from the King County bar Association's housing justice project, they were able to fight her case and have the judge turn down the Eviction.",2,,
23,0.97,233.266,236.703,But this is just the tip of the iceberg.,2,,
24,0.97,236.703,245.645,"There are so many, hundreds, if not thousands of tenants getting caught in what is Eviction epidemic in our city.",2,,
25,0.97,245.645,262.262,"I should also NOTE at this point that it was really important that our movement, the people's budget movement last year, many of whom you were a part of that we were able to win funds for our City- funded legal representation for tenants facing Eviction.",2,,
26,0.97,262.262,271.738,It had is a concrete example of how these dollars can actually help people to not allow their lives to fall apart.,2,,
27,0.97,271.738,279.979,The majority of the tenants who were evicted reported they fell behind on rent because of loss of work or medical or family emergency.,2,,
28,0.97,279.979,292.425,"The study pointed out that according to the U.S. Bureau of labor statistics, it typically takes a worker once out of a job a little more than nine weeks to find a new job.",2,,
29,0.97,292.425,302.435,"That's an average, so that's not nearly fast enough to save off the Eviction if the landlord is unwilling to show compassion and flexibility.",2,,
30,0.97,302.435,304.937,Eviction could also be a death sentence.,2,,
31,0.97,304.937,312.945,The study reviewed 2017 Evictions and found that six Seattle tenants died during or right after Eviction.,2,,
32,0.97,312.945,314.113,Four tenants committed suicide.,2,,
33,0.97,314.113,322.121,"One died of an accidental Overdose the day after being evicted, and one tenant died during the Eviction process while receiving Hospice care.",2,,
34,0.97,322.121,331.764,The study also found at least nine people who died homeless on the street in 2017 had an Eviction filed against them in the three proceeding years.,2,,
35,0.97,331.764,342.208,These data are a brutal indictment of a private housing market that is dominated by corporate landlords who take care more for profit than housing people.,2,,
36,0.97,342.208,355.655,"Of course we recognize there are good landlords out there, families who own a small number of rental homes who care about their tenants, who make timely repairs, who don't try to get away charging the highest possible rents.",2,,
37,0.97,355.655,360.893,Boutons had landlords aren't why we are considering a moratorium on winter Evictions tonight.,2,,
38,0.97,360.893,361.728,They're not the problem.,2,,
39,0.97,361.728,368.568,"We're here because of the big corporate landlords who control the bulk of the 174,000 rental homes in our city.",2,,
40,0.97,368.568,376.709,They are in the business of maximizing profits and they do so by exploiting tenants.,2,,
41,0.97,376.709,378.811,As the bar Association report demonstrates.,2,,
42,0.97,378.811,392.258,"The report also notes that following Eviction people reported increases in mental health crisis, displacement of their children from school because they had to move, and forced relocation outside Seattle.",2,,
43,0.97,392.258,398.097,"As bad as that is, it gets worse, much worse when the weather turns bad.",2,,
44,0.97,398.097,402.301,"As the Renters' Commission pointed out last fall, and I wanted to quote some of it.",2,,
45,0.97,402.301,420.253,"""during winter in Seattle, temperatures regularly fall into the 30s overnight and according to all home King County, a report from 2019, 41% of homeless neighbors sleep outside every night with an additional 19% sleeping in vehicles.",2,,
46,0.97,420.253,425.291,Neither of these situations provide much protection from the elements and both could be deadly.,2,,
47,0.97,425.291,436.836,"According to the King County medical examiner's office, 191 homeless individuals died last year and 57% died outdoors, in a vehicle, or an encampment.",2,,
48,0.97,436.836,453.986,"While exposure to the elements could not be blamed for every one of its deaths, it is most certainly a contributing factor as exposure to harsh weather and living conditions only exacerbates many Medical- related issues.",2,,
49,0.97,453.986,467.5,"Additional Liquoring to the 2019 count, 84% of homeless neighbors were previously housed in King County with an Eviction given as a direct cause of homelessness for 15% of surveyor respondents.",2,,
50,0.97,467.5,468.501,It isn't just a belief.,2,,
51,0.97,468.501,473.606,When we say an Eviction notice could be a death sentence.,2,,
52,0.97,473.606,478.811,The Renters' Commission is not exaggerating in stating winter Evictions could be a death sentence.,2,,
53,0.97,478.811,485.618,Likewise our movement is not exaggerated in saying this ordinance before the committee tonight will save lives.,2,,
54,0.97,485.618,500.333,"I congratulate the members of the Seattle Renters' Commission for demonstrating leadership on this issue and absolute all the people who spoke at a public hearing I held in my committee last December, when I unveiled the original legislation.",2,,
55,0.97,500.333,510.71,"So I just want to mention members of the tenant unions, small landlords, the transit riders Union, democratic socialists of America, and many more.",2,,
56,0.97,510.71,516.048,"When I announced we were introducing the bill in December, we got a number of calls into my office.",2,,
57,0.97,516.048,520.519,The overwhelming majority were positive and supportive.,2,,
58,0.97,520.519,539.939,"One I remember in particular a gentleman called our office and told my staff, ""I don't agree with someone on most things, but stopping winter Evictions, I agree with her, it's the right thing to do ."" and before we go to hear from members of the public, I wanted to note a few things about what this legislation does and does not do.",2,,
59,0.97,539.939,543.976,"Under this ordinance, tenants are still obliged to pay their rent every month.",2,,
60,0.97,543.976,551.751,"If you do not pay your month in winter, your landlord could bring you to Eviction court afterwards.",2,,
61,0.97,551.751,557.99,"The orders would not be carried out until April 1 when the cold, wet winter months are over.",2,,
62,0.97,557.99,568.901,The argument that Renters would risk Eviction by Non-Payments of rent in winter months has been reinstated by some political figures and landlord lobbyists.,2,,
63,0.97,568.901,572.204,It is a Ludacris idea not based on facts or ideology.,2,,
64,0.97,572.204,576.709,Such points are made by those completely out of touch by the lives of the Renters.,2,,
65,0.97,576.709,587.453,"Renters do everything in their powers to avoid any Eviction on their tenants because once you have an Eviction, it will never go away and creates major obstacles to renting in the future.",2,,
66,0.97,587.453,596.162,"And one benefit, a real benefit of this moratorium for both tenants and landlords is that it will give them extra time to cure their Non-Payment.",2,,
67,0.97,596.162,606.906,"And there are tenant assistance record available, but often they don't learn about these resources on time to save off the Eviction, happening over a couple of weeks.",2,,
68,0.97,606.906,611.844,"With the winter moratorium, Renters have a chance to get connected to health.",2,,
69,0.97,611.844,617.016,Tenants cannot simply avoid paying rent.,2,,
70,0.97,617.016,622.154,We will be discussing with the help of the Council staff.,2,,
71,0.97,622.154,625.858,Tenants engaged in criminal activity will not get protection from Eviction.,2,,
72,0.97,625.858,632.064,We also want to protect small landlords for unmanageable situations.,2,,
73,0.97,632.064,635.034,We have amendments aimed at protecting the needs of small landlords.,2,,
74,0.97,635.034,642.274,Those who rent out their Single- family homes can still sell their homes as long as they provide the 90-day notice that's required for them for the rest of the year.,2,,
75,0.97,642.274,647.38,An owner who wants to stop sharing his home with a tenant doesn't have to wait until April.,2,,
76,0.97,647.38,652.151,We had some discussions about how to define the winter months.,2,,
77,0.97,652.151,653.819,Obviously day-to-day weather is unpredictable.,2,,
78,0.97,653.819,663.763,"To decide where to draw the line, we looked at average temperatures, average precipitation, and also some unrelated precedence and, of course, the recommendation from the Renters' Commission.",2,,
79,0.97,663.763,673.005,"In Washington state there are protections in effect, sorry in Washington state there are protections to help prevent utilities from being shut off during the winter.",2,,
80,0.97,673.005,678.811,"Those protections are in effect November through March, so we aligned our bill through those months.",2,,
81,0.97,678.811,684.517,"Some may view it is not really that cold or wet in November, so why not have a shorter moratorium.",2,,
82,0.97,684.517,690.122,The data shows clearly an Eviction could be traumatic in November as well as in January and our committee table.,2,,
83,0.97,690.122,699.932,Shortly you'll hear from a tenant who was evicted in November with catastrophic results for her family.,2,,
84,0.97,699.932,718.017,"The excellent briefing memorandum notes that while there are currently no known U.S. examples of limiting rental Evictions during a set period of winter months there, are examples of local and state governments limiting or even banning Evictions under certain weather convictions.",2,,
85,0.97,718.017,720.653,Aly will go over this.,2,,
86,0.97,720.653,724.156,This is evidence shown throughout the country.,2,,
87,0.97,724.156,734.967,Indeed Seattle in Washington state actually have worse and even Renters protections according to some Southern States as data from the health and human services show.,2,,
88,0.97,734.967,740.039,We're in no danger in Seattle of Overlegislating the For- profit market.,2,,
89,0.97,740.039,743.709,Renters here are being heavily exploited.,2,,
90,0.97,743.709,755.588,These things happen in other States and their municipality points to the acknowledgment that government has a moral and ethical duty to protect people from the exposure to the elements.,2,,
91,0.97,755.588,760.192,This duty triumphs the financial interests.,2,,
92,0.97,760.192,765.297,Helping the residents especially families with children and elderly family members first.,2,,
93,0.97,765.297,769.535,"To reduce homelessness, to save lives, to put people before profit.",2,,
94,0.97,769.535,775.541,"Before we begin the discussion on our agenda item, we have public testimonials.",2,,
95,0.97,775.541,785.151,"I will read the names of the people who have signed up, and my staff will give me additional names that are being signed up.",2,,
96,0.97,785.151,787.453,Each person will have two minutes to speak.,2,,
97,0.97,787.453,792.558,"And please wrap it up after your time ends, and you can pay attention to the Digital Timer there.",2,,
98,0.97,792.558,793.893,I'll read a few names.,2,,
99,0.97,793.893,798.364,"If you hear your name being called out, please be ready.",2,,
100,0.97,798.364,806.372,"We have Marilyn Yim, Angie Gerald, and David Haines.",2,,
101,0.97,807.573,809.441,"Good afternoon, Council members or evening.",3,,
102,0.97,809.441,814.98,I'm a small mom and pop landlord and I have a few comments on the winter Eviction moratorium.,3,,
103,0.97,814.98,828.16,"I wanted to start by saying this proposal likely amounts to a regulatory of taking of a private property, depriving private owners of economical use for half the year, which would violate U.S.",3,,
104,0.97,828.16,828.994,Constitutional law.,3,,
105,0.97,828.994,834.133,"This five-month moratorium would stretch to seven, eight, nine months due to courtroom backlog that it creates in April.",3,,
106,0.97,834.133,838.571,This would amount to tens of thousands of dollars over that period of time.,3,,
107,0.97,838.571,843.809,Evictions have been going down in King County for the last 14 years.,3,,
108,0.97,843.809,848.914,"There were 1,200 Eviction filings in King County, fewer than half resulted in completed Evictions.",3,,
109,0.97,848.914,852.318,"And that was for the whole year, not just for November through April.",3,,
110,0.97,852.318,864.864,It seems you could have addressed this issue more effectively by providing emergency rental assistance directly to affected tenants rather than make this sweeping change to law that would shift a large financial burden onto the private property owner.,3,,
111,0.97,864.864,871.036,Emergency rental assistance would also spare the tenant from the traumatic courtroom experience and keep them reliably in their home.,3,,
112,0.97,871.036,875.875,I would encourage you to provide funding to keep people in their homes instead of this proposal.,3,,
113,0.97,875.875,878.277,This will hit small landlords like me the hardest.,3,,
114,0.97,878.277,883.415,We are already struggling under a very broad sweep of changes that the city has been making.,3,,
115,0.97,883.415,893.592,Mom and pop landlords like me are historically the people who provide more affordable middle housing that hard working people rely on to live in the city.,3,,
116,0.97,893.592,895.16,We provide hands-on local management.,3,,
117,0.97,895.16,899.932,"We have been willing to work with people, work things out with them, and less likely to Evict.",3,,
118,0.97,899.932,909.875,"These things should all be encouraged by the city Council, but I'm finding ordinances like this strongly push me to reconsider whether I want to continue renting out my house.",3,,
119,0.97,909.875,918.651,"I'm a working person, a Yonon member, who bought a Triplex to live in, because that was the only way I could find living in Seattle, by renting out Two- thirds of my house.",3,,
120,0.97,918.651,922.187,This is a part of my home and my retirement.,3,,
121,0.97,922.187,926.992,And I cannot absorb this kind of great loss.,3,,
122,0.97,926.992,933.999,"If this is about corporate landlords, then I strongly urge you to exempt small landlords like me.",3,,
123,0.97,933.999,942.274,"The negative spillover effects that you recently passed, and find other ways to address the real goals that you're trying to accomplish.",3,,
124,0.97,942.274,944.777,I'll say I'm willing and available to meet with you any time.,3,,
125,0.97,944.777,951.85,"I would really like to work one on one and talk about the issues tat face small landlords, so thank you for your time and for your consideration.",3,,
126,0.97,951.85,953.686,Thank you.,4,,
127,0.97,953.686,960.292,"Angie Gerald and David Haines, and then after that Sebastian Pasada.",5,,
128,0.97,960.292,966.966,"Hi, my name is Angie, and my husband and I rent two Single- family houses in the Ballard area.",6,,
129,0.97,966.966,972.171,"Since 2003 we have housed families with small children, working professionals, and trades people.",6,,
130,0.97,972.171,980.512,"Our tenants have included a university professor, a Paralegal, a King County worker, a Fedex worker, a plumber, a police officer, and a clothing designer.",6,,
131,0.97,980.512,994.226,"Our most recent tenants who signed a lease just prior to the first ordinance taking effect are a group of Millennials including a small business carpenter, two shop workers, and a grad student who hopes to be a Seattle public Schoolteacher.",6,,
132,0.97,994.226,1002.368,Our ability and the ability of other small landlords to offer naturally affordable housing is dwindling very quickly.,6,,
133,0.97,1002.368,1014.079,"This legislation and other recent ordinances have significantly increased the risk, liability, and cost of small Landlording in Seattle with higher rent for tenants and higher qualifying criteria for applicants.",6,,
134,0.97,1014.079,1016.882,It's a significant barrier to new landlords as well.,6,,
135,0.97,1016.882,1022.421,I have reached out to Council members and participated in the city's Rrio surveys in 2017.,6,,
136,0.97,1022.421,1030.362,I have found no indication that independent landlords are a part of the legislative process or have any voice at City Hall.,6,,
137,0.97,1030.362,1034.4,The result is the Corporatization of Landlording in Seattle.,6,,
138,0.97,1034.4,1042.775,"City Council is creating a rental market that's more expensive, less flexible, and less based on local relationships.",6,,
139,0.97,1042.775,1046.311,It favors property management companies and favors large corporations.,6,,
140,0.97,1046.311,1059.425,"Please shine a spotlight on small landlords and local businesses to fully consider what kind of Seattle you are creating to prevent people from being evicted in winter, help them pay their rent, help stabilize their lives.",6,,
141,0.97,1059.425,1066.932,I'm opposed to this legislation.,6,,
142,0.97,1066.932,1077.876,"Good evening, exemptions from Evictions is great, so is winter rapid Survivable for those already cheated by landlords.",7,,
143,0.97,1077.876,1089.221,When is Council going to write ordinances to protect women who have to bucket their water to the bathtub because her landlord refuses to fix the pipes that are ruining the bathroom.,7,,
144,0.97,1089.221,1093.959,The landlord always tells her they'll get around to it while forcing her to be friendly because he lives on site.,7,,
145,0.97,1093.959,1103.368,What about the woman who has to live in a Room-Shared basement that was leased for a year that is overwhelmed with flooding and black mold that is making her sick.,7,,
146,0.97,1103.368,1111.143,The landlord threatened to file an Eviction notice if she kept on complaining and a court order to force her to pay the remaining months on the rent.,7,,
147,0.97,1111.143,1118.283,"Attempting to ruin her credit, creating friction and intimidation, which is denying her rights to leave and get her money back.",7,,
148,0.97,1118.283,1128.894,"We need more protections from abusive landlords and their run down housing that's inflated, dilapidated, and ruining the quality of the pursuit of happiness.",7,,
149,0.97,1128.894,1138.17,This seems to justify asking the city Council to write laws that find landlords the overpriced rent.,7,,
150,0.97,1138.17,1152.351,"They charge for the press of things that are wrong with their rentals, that are less than the offering of housing and go after the banks, owning the run down property and back charged them what they overcharged the Renters.",7,,
151,0.97,1152.351,1159.625,"We need laws that will require, encourage, and force the banks to invest in 21st century, first world apartment housing.",7,,
152,0.97,1159.625,1166.231,Maybe even using the excuse their run down 20th century housing is not up to par.,7,,
153,0.97,1166.231,1175.741,And also encouraging homeownership to alleviate rundown rentals and please don't make this committee about taking names of Renters for another reelection voting block and trade of favors.,7,,
154,0.97,1175.741,1188.52,We need the Renters revolt to offset that with a great American housing build out without unqualified Non-Profits getting in the way.,7,,

157,0.97,1197.663,1267.599,"Quite honestly I'm just here to remind everybody that housing is a human right and we've been trying to perfect the human condition and yet here we are in the year 2020, still discussing the pie minute detail as opposed to discussing true research and development to solving homelessness, whether it is substance abuse, education, or--or legal protections for those people that are a part of the generation that for some reason or another have been allowed to take on responsibility of ""owning"" the right to give people shelter and giving them tax protections or tax incentives to transition out of those income brackets into something more humane that does not force them to have to deal with, this Dehumanizing rhetoric on a consistent basis.",9,,
158,0.97,1267.599,1294.326,"I'm just trying to remind you guys that we are human and we should be aiming to protect those rights and to remind ourselves of the Constitution and how it is meant to protect us as individuals, not separate us like they are trying to do with regards to housing.",9,,

160,0.97,1296.328,1301.266,And one of the responsibilities is to advocate for those who could not advocate for themselves.,10,,
161,0.97,1301.266,1304.236,And passing this legislation would save lives.,10,,
162,0.97,1304.236,1304.736,Thank you.,10,,
163,0.97,1304.736,1311.209,"And alleviate the major crisis of homelessness in the city, where we continue to struggle with this issue.",10,,
164,0.97,1311.209,1316.181,This measure will help everyone by protecting families and keeping more people off the streets.,10,,

170,0.97,1340.605,1341.173,Go ahead.,11,,
171,0.97,1341.173,1342.774,"Hi, I'm Elizabeth Lyles.",12,,
172,0.97,1342.774,1345.677,I don't have anything really prepared.,12,,
173,0.97,1345.677,1348.18,I just don't understand this war on landlords.,12,,
174,0.97,1348.18,1352.851,"I think most of us are the good guys and, again, I'm talking about the little landlords.",12,,
175,0.97,1352.851,1360.192,Many of whom 40% of us have now all sold over the last two years because of these laws.,12,,
176,0.97,1360.192,1361.126,I barely get by.,12,,
177,0.97,1361.126,1371.737,"I bought my house for, you know, 40 years ago and that's the reason I was able to rent it because I pay very little for it, but I go to the food Bank sometimes.",12,,
178,0.97,1371.737,1376.208,You cannot toll me if someone knows they are going to be evicted they could keep paying rent.,12,,
179,0.97,1376.208,1377.576,I think that's B.S.,12,,
180,0.97,1377.576,1381.012,"If I were in her position with no money, I would stop paying rent too.",12,,
181,0.97,1381.012,1383.115,If they know they are going to be evicted.,12,,
182,0.97,1383.115,1389.955,"So I just think it is unrealistic of you to claim that I'm going to get my rent, and I'm screwed if I don't get my rent.",12,,
183,0.97,1389.955,1397.562,"Somebody said well you should have a Slush Fund, well, I am like everybody else who makes $30,000 a year in this city.",12,,

186,0.97,1407.539,1414.946,So you know some of my friends have left their houses vacant for two years because they are afraid to rent under these laws.,12,,
187,0.97,1414.946,1417.949,I've been an abused woman.,12,,
188,0.97,1417.949,1425.824,"I would expect the landlord to pay for the damages and the violence that my Boyfriend caused, all these crazy things that are anti the landlord.",12,,

192,0.97,1434.166,1438.203,"We're not these monsters, these greedy monsters that you guys portray us to be.",12,,
193,0.97,1438.203,1444.843,"And just, you know, or have a Slush Fund, give us a carrot in front of a stick instead of a stick.",12,,
194,0.97,1444.843,1447.813,Give us 20% back to renting the people with Felonies.,12,,
195,0.97,1447.813,1463.662,"But again I've had a lot of violence in my life, these are broken cheekbones, broken teeth, I should be allowed to feel safe in my own home and the person that I'm dealing with, many of times, you know, I have a personal relationship with my tenants, I like them, they like me, and that's the way it should be.",12,,
196,0.97,1463.662,1471.069,Thank you.,12,,

198,0.97,1477.843,1480.011,This one here?,14,,
199,0.97,1480.011,1480.612,Testing.,14,,
200,0.97,1480.612,1483.915,Can everybody hear me okay?,14,,
201,0.97,1483.915,1489.921,So I understand there's been some amendments that have been made since I first read this ordinance.,14,,
202,0.97,1489.921,1493.358,"I'm responding to this wording, which I quote.",14,,
203,0.97,1493.358,1501.433,"Regardless of whether just caused for Eviction makes, the owner may not even Evict to tenants from the housing unit from November through March 31.",14,,
204,0.97,1501.433,1506.805,"Now if the amendments that have been passed, what I'm about to say is irrelevant, that's great.",14,,
205,0.97,1506.805,1511.142,But I'm going to make my points any way just to make sure.,14,,
206,0.97,1511.142,1512.31,I'm a single mom.,14,,
207,0.97,1512.31,1516.314,I don't get any child support from my daughter's dad.,14,,
208,0.97,1516.314,1526.057,"I rent a home, I rent room to supplement my income to support myself and my daughter, and I also work part time and working towards finishing my degree Online.",14,,
209,0.97,1526.057,1531.263,"My income is under $25,000 a year.",14,,
210,0.97,1531.263,1540.705,98% of the tenants that have lived in my house over the last ten years have been terrific people who got along well with each other and with me in our shared space.,14,,
211,0.97,1540.705,1542.841,But there have been some exemptions.,14,,
212,0.97,1542.841,1549.781,One example was an alcoholic person who became romantically involved with one of the other tenants.,14,,
213,0.97,1549.781,1556.187,"When the other person broke off the involvement, they began hostile, began threatening, harassing the other tenant.",14,,
214,0.97,1556.187,1565.597,This same person also brought a wanted felon into the house and began harboring him in their room.,14,,
215,0.97,1565.597,1567.933,And in another incident tried to steal my bicycle.,14,,
216,0.97,1567.933,1572.203,"This person was disrupting the peace, making everyone in our house feel unsafe.",14,,
217,0.97,1572.203,1577.409,"Thankfully under the just cause ordinance, I was able to Evict this person.",14,,
218,0.97,1577.409,1583.949,The just cause ordinance is a very important protection for homeowners and anyone who lives in shared housing.,14,,
219,0.97,1583.949,1596.127,"I am afraid that the wording as I read it of these Evictions, the winter ordinance, would put homeowners who rent their homes at risk.",14,,
220,0.97,1596.127,1609.174,"Most people that I have spoken to including those who support the ban on winter Evictions believe that under this ordinance, a landlord would still be able to Evict if they have just cause and obtain a court order.",14,,
221,0.97,1609.174,1617.315,"When I told people that the Eviction in the winter ordinance would not allow landlords to Evict the tenant from November through March, most people didn't believe me.",14,,
222,0.97,1617.315,1619.284,Some people accused me of lying.,14,,
223,0.97,1619.284,1620.352,Could you please wrap up.,15,,
224,0.97,1620.352,1621.453,"Yes, I could.",16,,
225,0.97,1621.453,1623.221,The others are also going to speak.,17,,
226,0.97,1623.221,1624.155,Okay.,18,,
227,0.97,1624.155,1635.166,"I just wanted to say if a tenant creates an unsafe situation on the shared household, there needs to be a way to remove them.",18,,
228,0.97,1635.166,1635.667,Thank you.,18,,
229,0.97,1635.667,1642.173,I believe it is now Sally and then if I'm reading it correctly.,19,,
230,0.97,1642.173,1646.011,"I'm Sally, I didn't really come here prepared to say anything.",20,,
231,0.97,1646.011,1650.515,"But I'm one of those people that owns a house in Georgetown, a large house.",20,,
232,0.97,1650.515,1658.089,It has sat vacant for two plus years because I'm afraid to rent under Seattle's rental laws.,20,,
233,0.97,1658.089,1665.397,"I would love to be able to rent the house, but with all the restrictions and all the hassle, this just adds one more thing.",20,,
234,0.97,1665.397,1677.642,"The thing is I could sell that house and make some really good money, but with my Mother-In- law's house, I'm attached to it and would rather keep it and rent it.",20,,
235,0.97,1677.642,1685.316,But I would rather sell it than lose it because I have to give somebody six months free rent.,20,,
236,0.97,1685.316,1687.752,That really removes everything to be a landlord.,20,,
237,0.97,1687.752,1693.324,"In Georgetown they are selling the lot and they buy the lot for $800,000.",20,,
238,0.97,1693.324,1698.43,They put up $3 million town homes on that piece of property.,20,,
239,0.97,1698.43,1701.833,I don't understand how that benefits the homeless people at all.,20,,
240,0.97,1701.833,1707.405,"If they can't afford the rent for a month, they certainly can't afford to buy a Condo or a Townhouse.",20,,
241,0.97,1707.405,1710.341,So it seems to me there ought to be a middle way.,20,,
242,0.97,1710.341,1721.486,"Maybe if you're going to exempt people, exempt small mom and pop Renters, landlords from having to do the Eviction.",20,,
243,0.97,1721.486,1733.998,"It just doesn't seem right that somebody who is like me, paying my bill and doing my thing that I should have to support people who choose not to pay their rent and then I have no recourse.",20,,
244,0.97,1733.998,1740.772,I have to support them and give them six months a rent or five free rent because it's cold outside.,20,,
245,0.97,1740.772,1748.179,"Seattle has a huge homeless problem, but I don't think it had is the answer.",20,,
246,0.97,1748.179,1752.117,Thanks.,20,,
247,0.97,1752.117,1753.718,"Sorry, after you.",21,,
248,0.97,1753.718,1755.72,Am I saying your name right?,22,,
249,0.97,1755.72,1756.554,It's Kate.,23,,
250,0.97,1756.554,1757.789,"Okay, Kate.",24,,
251,0.97,1757.789,1759.39,"For some reason, Yeah.",24,,
252,0.97,1759.39,1765.997,And after Kate we have Janet Van fleet and then Travis Johnson.,25,,
253,0.97,1765.997,1767.098,Go ahead.,25,,
254,0.97,1767.098,1777.475,"My name is Kate, I am representing BC Seattle, an organization dedicated to empowering our Houseless and neighbors.",26,,
255,0.97,1777.475,1782.013,We would like to thank Council member Sawant for introducing this ordinance.,26,,
256,0.97,1782.013,1785.416,We are in total support.,26,,
257,0.97,1785.416,1789.554,"I don't know how many of you were outside today, but it was miserable.",26,,
258,0.97,1789.554,1790.955,I was outside for about an hour.,26,,
259,0.97,1790.955,1794.526,"I'm soaked to the bone, I'm freezing.",26,,
260,0.97,1794.526,1801.099,This is putting people before profits.,26,,
261,0.97,1801.099,1801.466,It's important.,26,,
262,0.97,1801.466,1810.008,"So many people face Evictions, and in the winter months, it's miserable outside and we need to focus on humanity.",26,,
263,0.97,1810.008,1812.043,It's inhumane to put people out in the cold.,26,,
264,0.97,1812.043,1814.512,Most people don't want to be evicted.,26,,
265,0.97,1814.512,1817.949,Most people will do whatever they can to avoid it.,26,,
266,0.97,1817.949,1827.358,It is my understanding that more than a quarter of Evictions were filed when most rent is due on the first of the month.,26,,
267,0.97,1827.358,1836.367,"These landlords are getting people out as quickly as possible, so they are being put out on the street within weeks.",26,,
268,0.97,1836.367,1839.204,That seems dangerous to me.,26,,
269,0.97,1839.204,1839.637,It is important.,26,,
270,0.97,1839.637,1849.414,[Applause] I'm sorry if I Mispronounced your name.,26,,
271,0.97,1849.414,1850.582,Ms Janet.,26,,
272,0.97,1850.582,1855.086,"I'm Janet Van fleet, thank you for having this hearing here this evening.",27,,
273,0.97,1855.086,1862.961,I am in favor of this ordinance.,27,,
274,0.97,1862.961,1876.107,"I stand when I can with real women in black, a group that stands every time someone dies outside by violence or in a public place.",27,,
275,0.97,1876.107,1880.845,And has no place permanent to live.,27,,
276,0.97,1880.845,1920.151,"We have already stood this year I believe twice, still standing for people who died in December, and I'm here because I want to prevent all such deaths--and having an ordinance that would protect people from being evicted in the winter seems like one step towards that goal.",27,,
277,0.97,1920.151,1948.646,"I'm very sad to hear that people are willing to let a House sit empty when there are people freezing, miserable, and lacking the privacy that they need to be a human being in this city every single day.",27,,
278,0.97,1948.646,1962.093,"I hope that we can somehow quickly come, all of us, to a better solution than that.",27,,
279,0.97,1962.093,1973.404,And I hope that perhaps assistance to keep people in homes that are owned by small landlords could be a part of that.,27,,
280,0.97,1973.404,1975.406,Thank you very much for considering this.,27,,
281,0.97,1975.406,1978.109,[Applause],27,,
282,0.97,1978.109,1985.95,"Thank you, after Travis Johnson we have Nancy Renkin, Jessica, Roger, and Jeffrey Cook.",28,,

285,0.97,1994.892,2004.302,"Winter Evictions, they all should realize that it rains 60% in the greater Seattle area in a year.",29,,
286,0.97,2004.302,2010.742,I think it's cruel to kick out people in Seattle during winter.,29,,
287,0.97,2010.742,2018.483,It's extremely cold in Seattle during the winter and usually rainy.,29,,
288,0.97,2018.483,2022.72,"So please don't kick out Seattle Lites in the winter, thank you.",29,,
289,0.97,2022.72,2027.291,[Applause],29,,
290,0.97,2032.397,2032.764,Nancy?,30,,
291,0.97,2032.764,2033.331,Thank you.,31,,
292,0.97,2033.331,2042.807,Congratulations to the people who won their hard won election.,31,,
293,0.97,2042.807,2056.954,That election was between whether we wanted a city that was run by big business and for big business or whether we wanted a city that addressed the worse ravages of big business.,31,,
294,0.97,2056.954,2062.393,And we clearly decided we wanted the ladder.,31,,
295,0.97,2062.393,2066.597,I believe this ordinance is a move in that direction to protect citizens.,31,,
296,0.97,2066.597,2072.403,I want to reiterate some of the Statistics about Evictions.,31,,
297,0.97,2072.403,2084.949,"The big group of people facing Evictions is actually women with children, a child gets into trouble is getting Ansi is evicted.",31,,
298,0.97,2084.949,2096.26,So we are actually talking about throwing kids out of their homes and the trauma that that can result in.,31,,
299,0.97,2096.26,2101.532,Thank you.,31,,
300,0.97,2101.532,2109.807,"Hello, my name is Jessica Scalzo and I'm a Renter.",32,,
301,0.97,2109.807,2135.933,"I have not struggled to pay my rent up to this point, but I'm definitely in favor of no winter Evictions with I guess, I don't know what you call them, but it seems like there's some rules to it where if someone is causing too much of an issue or I think something to do with maybe having crimes charged on them or Felonies that there could be a reason to Evict somebody.",32,,
302,0.97,2135.933,2146.477,"I'm also not a small landlord, so I don't know what that is like and all the rules that they have to deal with to keep up their rental property.",32,,
303,0.97,2146.477,2156.454,"But what I know of Council members is that you're willing to work with everybody, so I feel like it really is just small landlords that are here, and I don't hear any corporate landlords yet.",32,,
304,0.97,2156.454,2159.69,So something could easily be worked out.,32,,
305,0.97,2159.69,2167.732,"But Yeah, I do think it is very cruel and Unfortunately not that unusual to Evict people during the winter months.",32,,
306,0.97,2167.732,2176.974,"I think it's cruel to Evict people in general, but especially during the winter months, so thank you very much for the time.",32,,
307,0.97,2179.544,2183.648,And then Jeffrey Cook.,33,,
308,0.97,2183.648,2186.717,"Thank you Council member Sawant, members of the committee.",34,,
309,0.97,2186.717,2197.128,I've sent you some written comments that I am sure you have taken time to look at.,34,,
310,0.97,2197.128,2206.037,"This is, there's been lots of good comments about--from the folks who are property owners and housing providers.",34,,
311,0.97,2206.037,2212.777,I think one problem Council member Sawant you keep repeating the 90% becomes homeless number.,34,,
312,0.97,2212.777,2215.213,"That's just false, that's not Substantiated.",34,,
313,0.97,2215.213,2221.085,We are currently doing a public disclosure request of that number.,34,,
314,0.97,2221.085,2228.192,"That is a very small number of uncertain sample size, so it is just false and you keep repeating it is not true.",34,,
315,0.97,2228.192,2234.265,"As soon as I get the information on where that survey came from, I'll send it to you.",34,,
316,0.97,2234.265,2239.604,"Those numbers are not tracked, so we don't know what happens after people get evicted.",34,,
317,0.97,2239.604,2248.446,You could spend some resources trying to find that out rather than doing this.,34,,
318,0.97,2248.446,2251.282,"Secondly you can't, I appreciate your win over Amazon.",34,,
319,0.97,2251.282,2255.219,I would love to talk to you about how we tax Amazon for housing.,34,,
320,0.97,2255.219,2257.421,I think that is not a bad idea.,34,,
321,0.97,2257.421,2269.1,However you can't just aggregate the decree of the Superior Court by legislative Fiat.,34,,
322,0.97,2269.1,2271.435,It just violates the separation of powers.,34,,
323,0.97,2271.435,2275.506,It is a basic constitutional principle.,34,,
324,0.97,2275.506,2288.619,"So if you would try to demand Divorces for five months out of the year, then you can't do that.",34,,
325,0.97,2288.619,2312.343,"And if you will have an impact on the low income housing that will show you the tremendous problem for the investor and it is going to force those agencies like the housing group to put more money in that escrow account to offset the risk, so this is not a well thought out idea and your amendments don't fix any of that.",34,,
326,0.97,2312.343,2319.45,[Applause],34,,
327,0.97,2319.45,2328.926,"Good evening, Jeffrey cook, I have been a Renter for a lot of my adult life, but I never remember a time when I felt it was my right to live for free.",35,,
328,0.97,2328.926,2336.0,"I always found a way even with my non-profit arts job to find a way to pay my job, so I knew I was doing the right thing.",35,,
329,0.97,2336.0,2348.379,"You said something about how the government needs to be helping people who are in trouble, and I appreciate that, but that's not what this is doing, this is putting us to solve a problem that is not really being solved at a government level.",35,,
330,0.97,2348.379,2354.018,You are asking the independent landlords to figure out a way to come up with the money to support someone else.,35,,
331,0.97,2354.018,2362.126,My husband and I recently bought a small Fixer upper house from our elderly neighbors and we have sunk everything into it.,35,,
332,0.97,2362.126,2369.834,"We've Mortgaged, borrowed money, cashed out our retirement savings, and fixed up this House perfect Liquoring to the huge long list of things you're suppose to do as a landlord in Seattle.",35,,
333,0.97,2369.834,2374.972,"And now if I have somebody living there who can't pay their rent, I can't cover for them.",35,,
334,0.97,2374.972,2376.64,We are intentionally keeping the rent low.,35,,
335,0.97,2376.64,2380.811,"We are making no money on that, are you listening to me?",35,,
336,0.97,2380.811,2383.247,We are renting it for the same price as our mortgage.,35,,
337,0.97,2383.247,2384.281,There's no extra money.,35,,
338,0.97,2384.281,2386.951,We did that to support the working class people of Seattle.,35,,
339,0.97,2386.951,2389.153,That was a part of our plan.,35,,
340,0.97,2389.153,2392.89,So I can't just pay five or six months worth of someone else's rent.,35,,
341,0.97,2392.89,2398.129,"This is only going to make the problem worse for our community because we will just sell the house, it's not worth it.",35,,
342,0.97,2398.129,2402.233,We can probably make enough money to cover what we put into it so far if we just do that.,35,,
343,0.97,2402.233,2409.073,"And that is one more house, little three-bedroom house that somebody could rent that is not going to be around anymore.",35,,
344,0.97,2409.073,2412.777,That's what independent landlords are just going to keep doing say a this is not worth it for me anymore.,35,,
345,0.97,2412.777,2425.322,"So if someone is being evicted for $2 or $10, that's something we've got to fix, but living in someone's house for five or six months and not pay any rent is not going to work for those of us who only have that as our one asset.",35,,
346,0.97,2425.322,2429.627,"Thank you, good night.",35,,
347,0.97,2430.895,2435.166,Thank you to everyone who testified in public comment.,36,,
348,0.97,2435.166,2439.904,"And on the record, we have been joined by Council member Pedersen.",36,,
349,0.97,2439.904,2444.208,"I wanted to read the item, agenda item into record.",36,,

352,0.97,2493.39,2499.53,Could we have one sentence introductions from each of you first?,36,,
353,0.97,2499.53,2501.765,Jonathan Rosenbloom.,37,,
354,0.97,2501.765,2504.034,I'm Alicia Roberts from Nickelsville.,38,,

357,0.97,2515.946,2523.654,And once again I wanted to mention thank you to all the committee members who agreed to have a 6:00 P.M.,40,,
358,0.97,2523.654,2524.088,Committee meeting.,40,,
359,0.97,2524.088,2531.262,"To begin our discussion, Alicia Roberts has had the courage to share with us her personal winter Eviction story.",40,,
360,0.97,2531.262,2539.77,"Really appreciate the willingness, Alicia, to share these personal events with us and hopefully as a result other people will be protected from going through what you have been through.",40,,
361,0.97,2539.77,2541.872,And so do you want to go ahead?,40,,
362,0.97,2541.872,2542.473,Thank you.,41,,
363,0.97,2542.473,2546.176,This is a little hard for me to share.,41,,
364,0.97,2546.176,2548.112,Just take your time.,42,,
365,0.97,2548.112,2549.58,You are going to do great.,42,,
366,0.97,2549.58,2555.886,Let me tell you about my winter Eviction and how it devastated my family.,43,,
367,0.97,2555.886,2559.99,A little over five years ago me and my 4-year-old daughter moved in with my mom.,43,,
368,0.97,2559.99,2565.095,"She had a stroke and couldn't live alone, and I couldn't afford where I was living anymore.",43,,
369,0.97,2565.095,2571.602,We got put on her section 8 voucher and filled out the application for the apartment complex.,43,,
370,0.97,2571.602,2573.137,They knew the circumstances of why I was there.,43,,
371,0.97,2573.137,2578.008,I had a written statement from her doctors saying she couldn't live alone and the rent was never late.,43,,
372,0.97,2578.008,2585.416,The landlord learned to approve my application because I still owed half a month's rent from the place I had recently moved from.,43,,
373,0.97,2585.416,2587.718,We had until the end of the month to move.,43,,
374,0.97,2587.718,2590.754,During this time my father passed away.,43,,
375,0.97,2590.754,2595.926,Needless to say we didn't move out at the end of the month.,43,,
376,0.97,2595.926,2599.463,I started looking for places to move to which I wasn't having any luck with.,43,,
377,0.97,2599.463,2602.166,I talked to the landlord and she wouldn't budge.,43,,
378,0.97,2602.166,2604.635,She started the Eviction process.,43,,
379,0.97,2604.635,2609.039,We were physically evicted by the sheriff's Department right about Halloween.,43,,
380,0.97,2609.039,2615.846,"My mom was 72 years old, and I couldn't have her sleeping outside in the winter, so I couch hopped her from one friend to the next.",43,,
381,0.97,2615.846,2618.682,Me and my daughter slept in my Jeep that whole winter.,43,,
382,0.97,2618.682,2621.719,"She was in preschool, so that made it a little more difficult.",43,,
383,0.97,2621.719,2627.958,"I was able to sign up for McKinney through the school, so that helped, but she still missed school.",43,,
384,0.97,2627.958,2633.764,"And having my daughter in the vehicle with me, I always tried to find a safe place to park at night.",43,,
385,0.97,2633.764,2639.703,"We parked a lot at Wal-Mart, grocery stores with Well-Lit parking lots and in neighborhoods I felt were safe.",43,,
386,0.97,2639.703,2645.909,Every night I would try to get to the store to use the bathroom or we would have to go outside.,43,,
387,0.97,2645.909,2650.381,"I ran out of gas a lot because I would use it up, keeping the heat on at night.",43,,
388,0.97,2650.381,2657.554,We got harassed by the police constantly.,43,,
389,0.97,2657.554,2663.727,One time they wanted me out of the city and followed me to the city limits and this was in the middle of the night.,43,,
390,0.97,2663.727,2666.397,Several months later I would eventually lose my vehicle.,43,,
391,0.97,2666.397,2671.702,The only safe and dry place I had to sleep because the police were so against me sleeping in my car.,43,,
392,0.97,2671.702,2673.404,At one point my daughter got sick.,43,,
393,0.97,2673.404,2680.11,"She had a temperature of 103, 104, and it was below freezing outside at night around 16 degrees.",43,,
394,0.97,2680.11,2684.415,We were able to stay at a friend's house until she got better.,43,,
395,0.97,2684.415,2688.552,"All winter long we went through this, sleeping in the car and couch Surfing.",43,,
396,0.97,2688.552,2693.457,I couldn't take care of her the way she needed and during the whole time I continued to try to find a place to rent.,43,,
397,0.97,2693.457,2695.292,We were coming down to the wire.,43,,
398,0.97,2695.292,2700.531,"If I didn't find a place soon, we would lose our voucher.",43,,
399,0.97,2700.531,2713.544,"I finally found a place a week before that happened and it met their criteria, but section 8 wouldn't approve it because they didn't want to pay the amount the managers were asking for, I lost the voucher.",43,,
400,0.97,2713.544,2719.249,"I have tried fighting for it, getting an extension, but it was no.",43,,
401,0.97,2719.249,2722.953,"I couldn't lose the only thing we had, the only thing to keep us all together.",43,,
402,0.97,2722.953,2728.358,"I refused to take no for an answer, so I start ad calling places in Olympia to fight it.",43,,
403,0.97,2728.358,2743.273,"That was when I found out there was a less than 1% availability of three-bedroom rentals in the whole County and out of that less than 1%, how many of them would take my voucher and fall into the price range that it was for.",43,,
404,0.97,2743.273,2743.74,Almost impossible.,43,,
405,0.97,2743.74,2748.245,I was able to build a case I could present to the board and they would decide from there.,43,,
406,0.97,2748.245,2758.322,So I started gathering documentation needed to prove my case.,43,,
407,0.97,2758.322,2769.199,And then I lost my daughter to cps.,43,,
408,0.97,2769.199,2769.666,Losing her broke me.,43,,
409,0.97,2769.666,2775.439,Up to that point I had been battling a drug addiction on and off for three years.,43,,
410,0.97,2775.439,2777.775,I dove first in that Eviction.,43,,
411,0.97,2777.775,2780.811,Two months later I was able to get into treatment and got sober.,43,,
412,0.97,2780.811,2784.982,"A month after I got out, my mom passed away and I Relapsed.",43,,
413,0.97,2784.982,2789.62,It took me a long time to recover from everything that happened that year.,43,,
414,0.97,2789.62,2793.824,I got clean and started staying.,43,,
415,0.97,2793.824,2801.999,They gave me the stability and the community support I needed to stay sober and start standing on my own feet again.,43,,
416,0.97,2801.999,2805.736,I celebrated two years sobriety on the 11th of this month.,43,,
417,0.97,2805.736,2810.24,I see my daughter all the time and can see her full time when I get into permanent housing.,43,,
418,0.97,2810.24,2813.143,Things are better now.,43,,
419,0.97,2813.143,2818.348,I don't know how different things would have been if we would have stayed where we were that winter.,43,,
420,0.97,2818.348,2819.283,I would never know.,43,,
421,0.97,2819.283,2828.158,But maybe being able to help prevent that from happening to someone else could make a difference in their life and in their future.,43,,
422,0.97,2828.158,2831.929,Council member Sawant's moratorium on winter Evictions.,43,,
423,0.97,2832.062,2842.539,"Thank you very much, Alicia.",44,,
424,0.97,2845.609,2846.243,I really appreciate that.,44,,
425,0.97,2846.243,2848.178,Thank you.,45,,
426,0.97,2848.178,2851.915,"John, did you want to speak on behalf of the tenant's Union?",45,,
427,0.97,2851.915,2854.318,"Sure, I can say a few words.",46,,
428,0.97,2854.318,2865.195,The tenants of Washington state is 100% behind this piece of legislation because it is just like--it makes sense.,46,,
429,0.97,2865.195,2871.635,It makes sense to throw someone out in the middle of the street and winter is beyond the pail.,46,,
430,0.97,2871.635,2877.507,I appreciate some of what the small landlords said.,46,,
431,0.97,2877.507,2887.751,I really do because there are some good small landlords that will actually work with tenants and have tried to avoid the Eviction process.,46,,
432,0.97,2887.751,2892.389,"But that is the exception, not the rule.",46,,
433,0.97,2892.389,2907.004,"What tenants need is time and in almost all the cases they need a little bit more time to come up with a plan or to make ends meet, and just like the person from Seattle said, your rent is up on the first and the Eviction starts on the sixth.",46,,
434,0.97,2907.004,2907.337,That's crazy.,46,,
435,0.97,2907.337,2917.948,How can you be expected to become a rental expert in five days?,46,,
436,0.97,2917.948,2923.42,"The whole problem is they don't have money, people don't want to live for free in some place.",47,,
437,0.97,2923.42,2925.022,They want to pay rent.,47,,
438,0.97,2925.022,2927.024,Nobody wants an Eviction on their record.,47,,
439,0.97,2927.024,2928.258,They want to pay rent.,47,,
440,0.97,2928.258,2929.559,They just need more time.,47,,
441,0.97,2929.559,2936.199,"This isn't about letting people live in houses for free, this is about being humane and rational.",47,,
442,0.97,2936.199,2945.676,It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that people want to just free load in your house or your extra house that you might have lying around.,47,,
443,0.97,2945.676,2947.544,It is unbelievable to think that.,47,,
444,0.97,2947.544,2950.781,That is not what's going on here.,47,,
445,0.97,2950.781,2951.381,Epidemic.,47,,
446,0.97,2951.381,2957.02,What we need is rational common sense legislation like this that will prevent people from dying in the street.,47,,
447,0.97,2957.02,2957.321,That's it.,47,,
448,0.97,2957.321,2958.255,That is what we need.,47,,
449,0.97,2958.255,2960.123,It is very simple.,47,,
450,0.97,2960.123,2962.726,"Coming up with a plan, it's fine.",47,,
451,0.97,2962.726,2968.131,"This period of time, you just need to give your tenants time.",47,,
452,0.97,2968.131,2974.938,"Frankly in most cases, it is not the small independent mom and pop landlords.",47,,
453,0.97,2974.938,2985.849,It's overwhelmingly these corporate landlords that come in and raise the rent and then you already have problems struggling with paying your rent because your wages have not gone up.,47,,
454,0.97,2985.849,2990.32,"So you already have this problem paying your rent and then the minute that you're late, boom.",47,,
455,0.97,2990.32,2993.023,That's when they get you.,47,,
456,0.97,2993.023,3004.167,"All we need, all we need is a little bit more time and to throw people out during the winter, I mean I had things prepared before I came in here.",47,,
457,0.97,3004.167,3008.839,But it is going to Boggle my mind to think that this is okay to do.,47,,
458,0.97,3008.839,3016.046,"And that it is okay to throw someone out, a family in the middle of winter, to throw them out onto the street, it is ridiculous.",47,,
459,0.97,3016.046,3018.715,"And so once again, we fully support the legislation.",47,,
460,0.97,3018.715,3027.691,"We think this is a great idea, and we should absolutely go ahead and do it.",47,,
461,0.97,3027.691,3028.291,Thank you.,48,,
462,0.97,3028.291,3048.178,"And so as I said before, council central staff has prepared a memo explaining the overall legislation and contains some of the amendments of the rules of reference, public comment, and if Council members are okay with it, we will have her walk through the memo and then we can start looking at the amendments.",48,,
463,0.97,3048.178,3052.115,"Thank you, chair, Council members, good evening.",49,,
464,0.97,3052.115,3072.536,"Council bill 119726 would amend the city's just cause Eviction ordinance by providing a defense to Eviction between November 1 and April 1. the just cause Eviction ordinance, excuse me, requires landlords or property managers to state one of 18 approved reasons listed in the ordinance in order to proceed with an Eviction.",49,,
465,0.97,3072.536,3087.484,"In addition to requiring that the Eviction meets one of the approved reasons, the just cause Eviction ordinance provides a defense to Eviction if the landlord or property manager has not registered the unit under the city's rental legislation and inspection ordinance.",49,,
466,0.97,3087.484,3099.496,I will now briefly describe I'm going through a little detail on what the bill does highlight some of the investments that the city will make to prevent homelessness in other areas and walk through the two proposed amendments.,49,,
467,0.97,3099.496,3102.632,I'm happy to answer questions along the way.,49,,
468,0.97,3102.632,3111.041,"And sorry, Ali, in terms of process, do we have to move the substitute or anything like that?",50,,
469,0.97,3111.041,3114.878,"When I read the item into record, do you have to do anything more?",50,,
470,0.97,3114.878,3131.761,"So you read the item into the record, then we got to the amendments, amendment one is the substitute bill, so that will be proceeded as an amendment, so you will need to move to amend the order or substitute the version.",51,,
471,0.97,3131.761,3133.296,Then we would move on to the next amendment.,51,,
472,0.97,3133.296,3150.313,"And I noted in the footnote to the other amendment that to the extent the language is somewhat inconsistent between the two amendments at the direction from the committee, I'll reconcile that in the final bill if both amendments proceed or other amendments are contemplated.",51,,
473,0.97,3150.313,3154.684,"Okay, please go ahead.",52,,
474,0.97,3154.684,3155.986,Okay.,53,,
475,0.97,3155.986,3157.42,Okay.,54,,
476,0.97,3157.42,3193.523,"So as I described previously the proposal would add a E defense to Eviction if they would result in vacating the housing unit any time between November 1 and April 1. this does not prevent a landlord or Aproperty manager from moving forward with the Eviction proceedings, but instead provides a defense for the tenants and in the proceedings, presumably the judge would delay the enforcement of that Eviction either setting a later date or may delay the hearing until a time under which the Eviction, the physical Eviction could proceed.",54,,
477,0.97,3193.523,3204.167,"And so in that sense it's relatively straightforward, it's just the physical Eviction could not occur, but they would not prevent the tenant from being evicted.",54,,
478,0.97,3204.167,3212.442,Currently the city invests in homelessness prevention programs that include services to qualifying tenants facing Eviction.,54,,
479,0.97,3212.442,3220.784,"So the distinction here that I'm about to describe, these are interventions that are typically trying to help the tenant prior to being evicted.",54,,
480,0.97,3220.784,3232.495,"And so if they, for example, are issued a pay or vacate notice, there would be resources available to tenants to remedy that situation.",54,,
481,0.97,3232.495,3244.874,"And with the changes to state law, the courts will have more discretion to consider payment plans and that sort of thing and access those funds potentially as they are moving into those proceedings.",54,,
482,0.97,3244.874,3248.078,And in 2020 the city invested $3.3 million.,54,,
483,0.97,3248.078,3257.22,"I will just NOTE in the memo I distributed to Council members, I dropped the word million, so it is not $3.3, it's $3.3 million.",54,,
484,0.97,3257.22,3267.197,And so my apology to support programs that provide emergency rental assistance to qualifying tenant have received a 14-Day notice.,54,,
485,0.97,3267.197,3274.871,Just over a dozen organizations in the city receive portions of these funds that are made available.,54,,
486,0.97,3274.871,3275.238,In addition --,54,,
487,0.97,3275.238,3275.605,Ali.,55,,
488,0.97,3275.605,3276.306,Madam chair.,55,,
489,0.97,3276.306,3279.376,"So Ali, can I follow up on that just a little bit.",55,,
490,0.97,3279.376,3280.143,Sure.,56,,
491,0.97,3280.143,3293.857,"And because I noticed on the E-mail or the memo that you sent out on January 10, there were a couple of possible areas or altercation of the ordinance.",57,,
492,0.97,3293.857,3303.7,One of those would have been or was targeted as creating a mitigation Fund.,57,,
493,0.97,3303.7,3312.142,I'm just wondering how the $3.3 million in the rental assistance kind of fills that potential gap.,57,,
494,0.97,3312.142,3318.515,I noticed that's one of the things that isn't included in the substitute ordinance.,57,,
495,0.97,3318.515,3322.786,I wanted to ask if there are resources in play and if that was a factor.,57,,
496,0.97,3322.786,3334.331,So I was laying out options available to Council members to consider as you are moving forward with considering this legislation.,58,,
497,0.97,3334.331,3351.181,"So the distinction in what I briefly described in that E- mail verses the mitigation funds, I was just describing as the organization that the city currently funds is to provide emergency rental assistance essentially to tenants who received 14 days.",58,,
498,0.97,3351.181,3354.017,So it would be the tenant who paid the landlord.,58,,
499,0.97,3354.017,3374.604,"This is addressing questions I was receiving or concerns that we had heard about the potential that if the tenant is judgment proof and if they successfully were able to use this defense, we are not required to vacate the property in that five-month period.",58,,
500,0.97,3374.604,3383.58,It would be a fund that could be made available to landlords under certain conditions.,58,,
501,0.97,3383.58,3395.959,"I didn't--unless I'm asked to sort of develop that amendment and pursue that, I would work with you or other Council members to determine sort of what criteria the city might release those funds.",58,,
502,0.97,3395.959,3422.652,"Last year the city adopted legislation to provide additional protections to tenants if domestic violence situations, and a part of what was included in that bill was a mitigation fund for landlords--essentially for the domestic violence survivors were not responsible for paying damages that may have occurred in the unit due to the domestic violence incident.",58,,
503,0.97,3422.652,3435.198,"And the mitigation fund would be available to landlords who are unable to collect the damages from the Abuser in that case, the person who created the damages.",58,,
504,0.97,3435.198,3457.32,"So this would be sort of along similar lines that in the event that a tenant was evicted on April 1, but remained in the unit for some period of time and didn't fulfill their obligation to pay rent during that time under certain conditions, the city could consider some sort of a mitigation fund to help back pay some of that rent to the landlord.",58,,
505,0.97,3457.32,3460.323,And just quake follow up on that.,59,,
506,0.97,3460.323,3468.865,Would that involve a new appropriation of money or could it potentially come from the $3.3 million that we've already kind of talked about for rental assistance?,59,,
507,0.97,3468.865,3473.469,It would likely require a new appropriation.,60,,
508,0.97,3473.469,3485.715,"$3.3 million, I would imagine has already or is in the process of being dispersed through contracts with the human services Department.",60,,
509,0.97,3485.715,3510.64,"Like the bill I was discussing regarding domestic violence survivors, that bill set up a fund, but it was subject to appropriations, so essentially it could be established without yet having identified the source of funds, and then through the city's supplemental or budget process in the fall of 2020 for 2021.",60,,
510,0.97,3510.64,3514.611,I could work with Council members to identify where those resources might come from.,60,,
511,0.97,3514.611,3516.546,"All right, thank you so much.",61,,
512,0.97,3516.546,3517.514,Sure.,62,,
513,0.97,3517.514,3518.248,Jonathan?,63,,
514,0.97,3518.248,3532.161,"Yes, and just to clarify, Ali, that $3.3 million funds, even when they are dispersed, they would show their resource for tenants right now to access if they can't make the rents, right?",64,,
515,0.97,3532.161,3539.969,Correct.,65,,
516,0.97,3539.969,3550.046,"Okay, so the program to support tenants for emergency rental assistance and in addition the city extended funding for Seattle rental housing assistance, pilot program.",65,,
517,0.97,3550.046,3560.523,"That provides rental assistance for tenants who are on the Seattle housing authority wait list for housing choice vouchers, that will provide longer-term rental assistance.",65,,
518,0.97,3560.523,3566.829,And then in addition the city also has a severe weather response plan for people who are experiencing homelessness.,65,,
519,0.97,3566.829,3580.143,"So these are not exactly resources to prevent the homelessness, but for our people who are experiencing homelessness, including expanding access to shelters during the severe weather events.",65,,
520,0.97,3580.143,3587.25,The memo attached to the agenda will provide related policies and the other jurisdictions.,65,,
521,0.97,3587.25,3604.133,"I'm not planning to go into great details tonight but I will summarize, I did not find any examples in this country of cities or other jurisdictions that will provide a blanket, prohibition on the Evictions.",65,,
522,0.97,3604.133,3609.405,"And where Paris, France, is the only example that I have found, and I did some research.",65,,
523,0.97,3609.405,3610.34,But I don't read French.,65,,
524,0.97,3610.34,3613.042,"A lot of the information, it was in French.",65,,
525,0.97,3613.042,3635.164,"So I did my best there and I did find the examples of some cities or the counties that would have regulations or business practices in place that the sheriff's Department who typically enforce the Evictions will follow or in the case of Washington, D.C., the U.S. Marshal's office, that prevent the enforcement of the Evictions during the certain condition.",65,,
526,0.97,3635.164,3647.143,"And so if the temperatures will drop below a certain temperature, you know, snowing, that sort of thing, then the actual physical removal of the tenant from the unit will be delayed for some period of time.",65,,
527,0.97,3647.143,3657.186,In addition there are several States that have cold weather rules that would prohibit the utility Shutoffs during November and April generally.,65,,
528,0.97,3657.186,3692.422,"And then there are two examples that were found in California that is not related to weather, but similarly limits the ability for the landlord to move forward during the school year if the tenants have School- aged children or are educators, but important to note those cases are related through no fault Evictions, so that will be the case under which, let's say the landlord is intending to Redevelop the property, that's not the fault of the tenant or the Eviction couldn't proceed.",65,,
529,0.97,3692.422,3699.962,"If it was due to Non-Payment of rent, they could proceed during that chair.",65,,
530,0.97,3699.962,3715.511,"Yeah, so going back to the Cook County ordinance, just real quickly, that will ban the Eviction and under certain circumstances where they drop below 15 degrees fahrenheit.",66,,
531,0.97,3715.511,3717.313,I have two questions.,66,,
532,0.97,3717.313,3718.448,I'll ask this one first.,66,,
533,0.97,3718.448,3730.493,"So if there is a string of days that are under 15 degrees, and that prohibition could go indefinitely until the temperatures are above 15 degrees.",66,,
534,0.97,3730.493,3733.863,And fahrenheit is how it will work in practice.,66,,
535,0.97,3733.863,3743.005,"And so in practice, they would issue that Circuit Court of Cook County, during the set period of time.",67,,
536,0.97,3743.005,3754.784,"And so in one example, it's between November and January second, so I think it will sort of depend on the string of days to occur as they might issue that other order on how they would play out.",67,,
537,0.97,3754.784,3769.899,"And in general what I have heard in talking to some folks, who work in Cook County, that in general the sheriff's office, they wait until the temperatures have gone up.",67,,
538,0.97,3769.899,3775.338,It will give the authority to court to issue the order to seize the Eviction?,68,,
539,0.97,3775.338,3776.038,Correct.,69,,
540,0.97,3776.038,3780.71,And I noticed that language is permissive that says May.,70,,
541,0.97,3780.71,3791.32,"So under that ordinance, again, the party would petition to the court for a delay in that position and that the judge could deny it?",70,,
542,0.97,3791.32,3792.221,Is that true?,70,,
543,0.97,3792.221,3802.865,"Yes, my understanding is that the sheriff's office, they generally, as a business practice, does not enforce during that time.",71,,
544,0.97,3802.865,3810.006,And so it is--I'm not an attorney and I know that you are.,71,,
545,0.97,3810.006,3818.08,"But that it wasn't clear to me exactly how this plays out on the ground in all cases, but I think your interpretation is correct.",71,,
546,0.97,3818.08,3821.551,Thanks.,72,,
547,0.97,3821.551,3822.251,Okay.,73,,
548,0.97,3822.251,3829.492,"And if there are no other questions at this point, I will move on and begin describing the amendments.",73,,
549,0.97,3829.492,3835.031,And so the amendment one sponsored by Council member Sawant is a substitute version of the bill.,73,,
550,0.97,3835.031,3836.666,It is attached to the memo.,73,,
551,0.97,3836.666,3848.911,"This would do a couple of things, this would make structural changes to the bill and modify the language to clarify that it provides a defense that they would cause the displacement in the unit between November 1 and April 1.",73,,
552,0.97,3848.911,3859.856,"And then in addition, it will add, limits on the Evictions of the winter months, to that just cause that will be listed in the just cause ordinance.",73,,
553,0.97,3859.856,3866.996,So I'm going to quickly summarize the situations in which the Eviction could proceed at any time of the year.,73,,
554,0.97,3866.996,3882.445,"And so that will include if you were Evicting a tenant residing in the same house with the owner or the owner's agent, and so essentially you own the house, you're renting out rooms in your home, and you want to move forward, so you could continue to do that.",73,,
555,0.97,3882.445,3895.157,"And if the owner or the owners immediate family wishes to occupy the premise and they have been provided a minimum of a 90-day unit, required by the ordinance.",73,,
556,0.97,3895.157,3907.737,"And if the property owner is selling a single-family home, this does not include the condominium units, after giving them the required 90-day notice that they are intending to end the tendency.",73,,
557,0.97,3907.737,3928.658,"And it would allow the Eviction to continue if the property owner is planning to discontinue use of the unit that was not authorized under the land use code, and so essentially renting out an illegal unit and they have received a notice of violation from the city in those cases, the owner must pay Relocations.",73,,
558,0.97,3928.658,3933.062,And they were forced to leave because of that violation.,73,,
559,0.97,3933.062,3951.514,"If there is a violation related to the number of tenants sharing on the dwelling unit and they have issued orders, if they were terminating a tendency in the house in order to comply with the accessory dwelling unit after receiving a notice of violation.",73,,
560,0.97,3951.514,3960.523,Or if an emergency ordered to vacate and close the property has been issued by the city and the tenants have failed to vacate by the deadline given in that order.,73,,
561,0.97,3960.523,3967.396,And typically in an emergency order to vacate Reassistance funds available to low income tenants.,73,,
562,0.97,3967.396,3977.54,And then also if the tenant will engage in criminal activity or operate in that illegal business and that building on the premise in the area adjacent to building or the premise.,73,,
563,0.97,3977.54,3982.178,Or if they are causing a nuance due to criminal activity or illegal businesses.,73,,
564,0.97,3982.178,3996.025,"And so in those cases, if the cause for Eviction is brought by the landlord, it is due to one of those situations the tenant, excuse me, the Eviction could proceed at any time of the year.",73,,
565,0.97,3996.025,3999.028,Thank you.,74,,
566,0.97,3999.028,4017.413,"And so just to also read for a little bit on your part of the memo, the just cause Eviction ordinance, specifies 18 causes or just causes under which they could take on the city of Seattle.",74,,
567,0.97,4017.413,4028.591,"I believe you have listed eight of those causes where this bill, if passed, would not provide any defense for the Eviction to take place.",74,,
568,0.97,4028.591,4039.835,In other words any of these other eight cases that the Eviction would still proceed under the existing law and would not prevent them in the winter months.,74,,
569,0.97,4039.835,4044.707,"Yes, while I'll just NOTE as you listed eight.",75,,
570,0.97,4044.707,4047.51,Some of those is written in the substitute bill.,75,,
571,0.97,4047.51,4053.983,"They are a portion of one of the causes, and so sort of depends on how you are saying.",75,,
572,0.97,4053.983,4056.118,That is not accurate.,76,,
573,0.97,4056.118,4058.487,And the counting.,77,,
574,0.97,4058.487,4069.398,And I'm happy to update a table that I have created previously that will outline the causes and to share with the rest.,77,,
575,0.97,4069.398,4080.276,If there are other causes that might have prevented the other causes under that Council member and I could provide that.,77,,
576,0.97,4080.276,4092.955,"Here are the ones that clearly would no longer be limited for the Evictions under this ordinance and the ones where they would be limited in winter months, to distribute that tomorrow afternoon.",77,,
577,0.97,4092.955,4096.759,And that would be helpful.,78,,
578,0.97,4096.759,4098.561,"Yeah, okay.",79,,
579,0.97,4098.561,4123.886,"I would, so for now any way, you know, to continue the discussion with the substitute on the new base, I would like to move the amendment for a vote, but just to make sure members of the public understands this is only the vote to amend the legislation that is under consideration because we make changes to the legislation as it was written before.",80,,
580,0.97,4123.886,4127.156,Not the actual legislation that is being passed.,80,,
581,0.97,4127.156,4130.292,So I move the substitute version two for version one.,80,,
582,0.97,4130.292,4130.759,Second.,81,,
583,0.97,4130.759,4135.598,Thank you all in favor say aye?,82,,
584,0.97,4135.598,4135.865,Aye.,83,,
585,0.97,4135.865,4142.972,"Okay, so we now have the substitute version of the legislation under discussion.",83,,
586,0.97,4142.972,4146.075,"Council member Pedersen, would you like to speak to your amendment?",83,,
587,0.97,4146.075,4148.177,"Thank you, thank you, chair.",84,,
588,0.97,4148.177,4155.317,"I do have some other questions to start with, is that okay?",84,,
589,0.97,4155.317,4156.752,Yes.,85,,
590,0.97,4156.752,4158.654,First taking a Stepback.,86,,
591,0.97,4158.654,4186.882,"First thanks to everyone who came to speak tonight from all angles of this legislation, and want to thank the women's Commission and the King County bar Association for their report losing home, and thank the state for extending the period from three days to 14 days and I know there is a lot more work to do to prevent Evictions.",86,,
592,0.97,4186.882,4196.158,I'm interested in the financial assistance piece.,86,,
593,0.97,4196.158,4203.966,And by tackling this financial assistance to deal with the crisis or a need that will be occurring in that time.,86,,
594,0.97,4203.966,4238.3,"I am concerned overall with this legislation that it is bold and I admire that I'm just concerned about the big picture because there's no other city that has done this, it is untested and I don't believe that is the best way of going about the public policy to cast a wide net so quickly with unattended consequences and whether it will be a sustainable law.",86,,
595,0.97,4238.3,4244.173,And a couple of questions for central staff.,86,,
596,0.97,4244.173,4249.878,Just for the public to understand and to eliminate the discussion.,86,,
597,0.97,4249.878,4256.719,What happens to the leases that are signed by the landlord and the Renter when this is passed?,86,,
598,0.97,4256.719,4263.125,Is it to show the elite contract lease?,86,,
599,0.97,4263.125,4263.759,I apologize.,87,,
600,0.97,4263.759,4265.194,I overlooked in detail.,87,,
601,0.97,4265.194,4288.684,"The just cause Eviction ordinance implies to those tendencies that are month to month or verbal contract and does not apply to tendencies where there is a lease agreement that doesn't have, you know, many lease agreements that have shifted to a Month-To- month agreement or renewed.",87,,
602,0.97,4288.684,4297.092,But if it is a lease that is not renewed and Seattle does not apply to the situations.,87,,
603,0.97,4297.092,4301.163,This would not apply to those circumstances.,87,,
604,0.97,4301.163,4304.867,Just so I could clarify.,88,,
605,0.97,4304.867,4316.178,"In cases where someone has a year-long lease, for example, like this ordinance that we are discussing, it wouldn't be applicable?",88,,
606,0.97,4316.178,4321.45,They would still be subject to the same winter current Eviction?,88,,
607,0.97,4321.45,4337.366,"Yeah, they would be subject to the Washington state landlord laws as well as other regulations, typically the lease agreement, they will have an agreement between the two.",89,,
608,0.97,4337.366,4349.812,"And so that would apply and then like I said before, many of them, they do shift to a month-to-month lease at the end of the first year period, but that depends on your landlord.",89,,
609,0.97,4349.812,4355.317,"Right, as the only Renter in this Committee, I'm familiar with the nuances of the lease.",90,,
610,0.97,4355.317,4358.12,I would just ask for a brief follow up.,90,,
611,0.97,4358.12,4363.992,"If you don't know this off the top of your head, that's all right.",90,,
612,0.97,4363.992,4381.143,But I wonder what the rental housing stock on the city of Seattle that is on a Month-To- month or verbal lease and I would actually be curious to know what the number is of folks that are not entered into a lease that is longer term.,90,,
613,0.97,4381.143,4385.414,I don't know if it is small or large.,90,,
614,0.97,4385.414,4389.718,"I have never entered into a lease like that, so I'm just not sure.",90,,
615,0.97,4389.718,4393.789,I do not have an answer to that question and I'm happy to look into it.,91,,
616,0.97,4393.789,4400.929,"I'm not sure if that information is available, but I will see what we have or what we could find out.",91,,
617,0.97,4400.929,4401.463,Okay.,92,,
618,0.97,4401.463,4415.444,"Just to understand the origin of this idea, is it, is there something that triggered it to be introduced this year instead of, you know, four years ago or three years ago?",92,,
619,0.97,4415.444,4422.651,Is there something that is happening now that sort of caused for this type of intervention or intervention?,92,,
620,0.97,4422.651,4428.59,And I can tell you what my intention has been because I was the one who introduced it.,93,,
621,0.97,4428.59,4429.158,Yes.,94,,
622,0.97,4429.158,4437.366,It is no different than any other progressive legislation that my office has fought for and no explanation for why.,95,,
623,0.97,4437.366,4443.605,I mean there is no explanation for what you are looking for why $15 was wanted in 2015.,95,,
624,0.97,4443.605,4450.045,And we were elected and there was a movement behind us that was willing to fight for it and we won.,95,,
625,0.97,4450.045,4455.15,And so does that mean we didn't need $15 before then?,95,,
626,0.97,4455.15,4460.689,"No, of course not, we needed it before then and in fact even 15 is not enough.",95,,
627,0.97,4460.689,4493.856,"But the point is if there are people willing to fight for those causes, then it is my job to push for it and this whole question originated from the letter that the Seattle center released and that is their job and that is why I'm not sure how many of you are aware, but the creation of the Renters Commission itself was a consequence of the rent control resolution that we fought for and won in 2015.",95,,
628,0.97,4493.856,4508.904,"And in 2016 in order to sort of, you know, the rent, the movement that it will be building up at that time was able to show you the concession from the political establishment.",95,,
629,0.97,4508.904,4527.155,"And at that time they would form it, hoping these commissions would actually do much, but you know just sort of be there and that the members Commission are doing an incredible job of being independent from the city Council and the Mayor's office and making the recommendations.",95,,
630,0.97,4527.155,4529.391,It was based on their recommendation.,95,,
631,0.97,4529.391,4532.361,"They made the recommendation some time in early November, I believe.",95,,
632,0.97,4532.361,4543.672,"I remember seeing the letter, from the second and then as soon as I got a chance in late November or early December, I instructed staff to bring it forward.",95,,
633,0.97,4543.672,4546.408,"Thank you, thank you.",96,,
634,0.97,4546.408,4563.725,"And so to my amendment, so this amendment would have the legislation focused on a low income housing household that we know are low income because they are benefiting from some city government assistance.",96,,
635,0.97,4563.725,4591.019,And so the low income housing projects that we fund through the housing levy through the multi-family tax exemption program that would focus this legislation on that group because we know that we have verified the incomes and we know they are low income and in need and also it is really the city to walk the talk.,96,,
636,0.97,4591.019,4596.658,And that we will apply it to our programs that we are supporting financially as a city government.,96,,
637,0.97,4596.658,4604.166,We are going to apply it because it is not this Eviction ban that does not apply to the current systems.,96,,
638,0.97,4604.166,4627.356,"So because this has never been done anywhere in the United States to cast the wide net immediately apply it to the private market with unattended consequences, focusing it in on who we know to be low income and who is receiving support from the city of Seattle already, which we could impose this restriction.",96,,
639,0.97,4627.356,4629.491,And so that's the purpose.,96,,
640,0.97,4629.491,4637.065,Happy to answer any questions about it.,96,,
641,0.97,4637.065,4640.168,Do committee members have any comments?,97,,
642,0.97,4640.168,4644.272,"Well, I might have a general comment about this.",98,,
643,0.97,4644.272,4657.219,"I think, you know, as we think about who is disproportionately impacted by the Eviction in general in this city, it is typically women, it is typically women of color.",98,,
644,0.97,4657.219,4665.36,"We heard Alicia's story about the impact that it has on families, the devastating impact that it could have on families.",98,,
645,0.97,4665.36,4673.135,"And so I think, you know, there is no question we are in a crisis in this city and in a homelessness crisis.",98,,
646,0.97,4673.135,4679.808,"I believe anything we could do to prevent additional people from becoming homeless, we should do.",98,,
647,0.97,4679.808,4689.818,"So as it relates to this piece of legislation, I think it is important that we think about ways that we could keep people from getting pushed out.",98,,
648,0.97,4689.818,4704.633,"I think they address many of the concerns that they have with regards to, you know, being able to remove the tenant from your home, from living inside your home, remove the tenant who is engaging in criminal activity.",98,,
649,0.97,4704.633,4712.174,And those are important things to consider and I appreciate the landlord coming forward to discuss that.,98,,
650,0.97,4712.174,4724.219,"And as it relates to this amendment, I think the challenge is that this amendment would eliminate many of the people who are actually experiencing Eviction from benefiting from this bill.",98,,
651,0.97,4724.219,4731.159,"A part of the challenge is that people struggle, they don't qualify for some of the housing assistance that we offer.",98,,
652,0.97,4731.159,4746.541,"We know that many people, they are on a waiting list to get to the housing assistance programs and so people who are experiencing Eviction if we are only protecting those who qualify, there are huge steps that we are missing.",98,,
653,0.97,4746.541,4756.084,We know there are many people who are in a situation where they don't qualify for that housing or are on a waiting list and they are still struggling to pay rent.,98,,
654,0.97,4756.084,4778.44,"And that is why they are dealing with the Eviction because we just haven't kept pace and people are unable to make a payment, sometimes a small payment, sometimes it is larger, giving them the opportunity to cure that problem without being faced with having to go out in the street in the middle of winter.",98,,
655,0.97,4778.44,4798.927,And so I think it's important for us to provide protection for people to the extent that we can and this is something that we can do to really make sure the families aren't struggling.,98,,
656,0.97,4798.927,4816.378,"I think the merit of the amendment, I think it has to be based on what proportion of rental homes are, you know, fulfilled on the criteria and that you have this unit with the city support.",99,,
657,0.97,4816.378,4824.853,"I believe the number, so the overall number, Ali, you should correct me if you have anymore confirmation.",99,,
658,0.97,4824.853,4840.669,"But the total number of the rental homes is about 174,000 and the city and about 17,000 rental homes fulfill the criteria f being in the units with the city support.",99,,
659,0.97,4840.669,4859.087,"And so in other words if this amendment that is being brought forward by Council member Pedersen is adopted, it would leave and the legislation passes, the legislation would not do what it needs to do because it would have left 90% of the tenants unprotected.",99,,
660,0.97,4859.087,4863.191,"I mean the number, it is huge.",99,,
661,0.97,4863.191,4883.812,"And it will go to the point that Council member Morales made, which is as a matter of fact the problem, the problem that they face that is related to the investments we were discussing last night, which is there is not enough affordable housing, social housing with city-owned housing to go around.",99,,
662,0.97,4883.812,4890.018,It is a very small fraction of the total housing stock.,99,,
663,0.97,4890.018,4891.953,"Council member Pedersen, why don't you go?",100,,
664,0.97,4891.953,4894.322,"Sure, thank you.",101,,
665,0.97,4894.322,4895.423,Just to respond to that.,101,,
666,0.97,4895.423,4903.665,"I guess using those numbers, I think you were using the entire rental stock?",101,,
667,0.97,4903.665,4914.175,I guess I'm trying to focus,101,,
668,0.97,5046.808,5052.147,I would be happy for Seattle to do the right thing to be the city to do the right thing.,102,,
669,0.97,5052.147,5056.251,We have done many things as the city.,102,,
670,0.97,5056.251,5073.768,"One one of the first cities to pass $15 an hour, and I'm sure there are other commendable things that have happened years before, where Seattle was, the first city to do that or Washington state might have been the first state.",102,,
671,0.97,5073.768,5088.917,"I don't think that, I mean if people are freezing to death on the streets of Pittsburgh or Boston, I don't think because other cities don't have this BUYS our city more Absolution.",102,,
672,0.97,5088.917,5092.754,We absolutely have to do whether it had solution is available.,102,,
673,0.97,5092.754,5097.325,"The Renters Commission have provided it, that's why we're here.",102,,
674,0.97,5097.325,5099.227,Council member Lewis and then John.,102,,
675,0.97,5099.227,5105.834,"Right, and these are also, I guess, some questions for Council member Pedersen and also potentially central staff.",103,,
676,0.97,5105.834,5117.245,But this is sort of in the context of our previous discussion about the types of rental arrangements this Ordinanc would apply to.,103,,
677,0.97,5117.245,5122.851,"I mean I'm looking at the Website of the Seattle housing authority right now, right?",103,,
678,0.97,5122.851,5129.724,It looks like they tend to enter into 12-month leases with folks.,103,,
679,0.97,5129.724,5143.872,"So to extend the coverage to the housing authority would involve extending it to 12- month leases, which I thought from our previous discussion this ordinance wouldn't cover.",103,,
680,0.97,5143.872,5157.252,Is there an extra hook because there are housing dollars covering the housing units or did I misunderstood misunderstand previously?,103,,
681,0.97,5157.252,5180.708,"To apply the just cause Eviction ordinance would require a separate ordinance that would be amending the just cause Eviction ordinance in general to the Seattle housing authority specifically, it really depends on what that lease agreement looks like and whether or not it TERMINATES exactly at 12 months or if it switches to a month to month.",104,,
682,0.97,5180.708,5189.317,Council member Pedersen's amendment is not necessarily applying to all Seattle housing authority projects.,104,,
683,0.97,5189.317,5201.129,"It would apply to projects that have city funding, which are often, you know, oftentimes the city is investing in projects and Partnering with the Seattle housing authority as well as other Non-Profits.",104,,
684,0.97,5201.129,5222.684,But this would also apply to developers who are participating in this city's multi-family tax exemption program or if the housing was developed on city-owned land or if for other reasons the city has provided some financial assistance in the past and continues to monitor and regulate those units.,104,,
685,0.97,5222.684,5229.457,I can't speak to how all of those organizations operate their businesses and what types of lease agreements they have.,104,,
686,0.97,5229.457,5236.13,I will certainly look into it and sort of to follow up with your question to figure out how to answer that.,104,,
687,0.97,5236.13,5257.518,"I guess in my role of sort of seeing all sides of an issue, you could look at it in one way as this would be a way to test a policy and see where it applies or does not apply in another approach I had outlined in the E-mail that you had quoted earlier.",104,,
688,0.97,5257.518,5261.889,It would be to apply it to just low income tenants generally.,104,,
689,0.97,5261.889,5288.182,"I think the considerations here were tenants who have already been Vetted, who have been qualified, income qualified verses adding a step that the city would have to do in order to income test the tenants before or the courts to determine whether or not this protection or limitation on when it could be Escience Viced could be applied.",104,,
690,0.97,5288.182,5290.718,Now correct me if I'm wrong.,104,,
691,0.97,5290.718,5292.253,"Well said, thank you, Ali.",105,,
692,0.97,5292.253,5307.468,"Yes, just to follow up on that too because actually one thing that I do like about Council member Pedersen's ordinance, the means testing is sort of built in to it, like it is Administerrable in that effect.",106,,
693,0.97,5307.468,5320.415,"But I wonder if it were to be--if there were to be a means testing that was not hooked to being in a Seattle housing authority property, what are some of the tools we would have?",106,,
694,0.97,5320.415,5336.397,"Like would the person in court, in the Eviction proceeding when they are trying to establish their defense, what they need to establish that they are in an earning position that would put them in a low income category that we would establish in the ordinance?",106,,
695,0.97,5336.397,5342.603,And so with the burden beyond the person defending an Eviction to prove in the Eviction court.,106,,
696,0.97,5342.603,5344.672,Is that how that would be administered?,106,,
697,0.97,5344.672,5347.475,It would be a defense for the tenant.,107,,
698,0.97,5347.475,5348.976,They would have to demonstrate.,107,,
699,0.97,5348.976,5363.691,"It would really depend on a number of options we could look Úat or you could look at, I could have worked with you to look at to develop in terms of how you might--what criteria you might have.",107,,
700,0.97,5363.691,5366.06,It could be an income qualification.,107,,
701,0.97,5366.06,5380.341,"For example for the city's tenant relocation assistance ordinance, which requires relocation assistance under certain conditions if the property owner, for example, is Redeveloping the property, they have to apply for a tenant relocation assistance license.",107,,
702,0.97,5380.341,5386.814,And that requires essentially determining which tenants qualify based on their income.,107,,
703,0.97,5386.814,5391.052,And there is a process Underwhich the city Verifies that.,107,,
704,0.97,5391.052,5400.361,"I'm not sure if the city has regulations like this, but I know of other areas for certain things and the tenant qualifies if they receive other types of assistance.",107,,
705,0.97,5400.361,5412.173,"So sort of if they are already receiving like food assistance or certain medical assistance, if they qualify for other County, state, local programs that might be the test.",107,,
706,0.97,5412.173,5419.847,"If you qualify for that, you are determined to be low income for the purposes of whatever the regulation is.",107,,
707,0.97,5419.847,5426.053,So there are a number of ways we could go here.,107,,
708,0.97,5426.053,5448.176,"This one is just because when a unit is under sort of a regulatory agreement with the city, they not only have to be qualified when they move in, but there is a Recertification process and the city monitors to ensure the units that the city invested in that they are meeting the rent and income restrictions and surveying the populations that were intended.",107,,
709,0.97,5448.309,5458.486,"And I have Alicia who also wanted to speak, then John, and Ted wanted to clarify something based on the discussion.",108,,
710,0.97,5458.486,5464.492,And so we rented from a privately owned corporation that owned our complex.,109,,
711,0.97,5464.492,5470.598,Am I correct to say that we would not be covered under this ordinance?,109,,
712,0.97,5470.598,5473.901,Right now the ordinance would cover you.,110,,
713,0.97,5473.901,5475.903,The amendments.,111,,
714,0.97,5475.903,5476.237,Okay.,112,,
715,0.97,5476.237,5483.644,The amendment that would not cover us?,113,,
716,0.97,5483.644,5488.115,And so are we having others at the table as well?,114,,
717,0.97,5488.115,5491.552,What do you mean?,115,,
718,0.97,5491.552,5500.161,"Well, I just didn't know if any small landlord groups were going to join us.",116,,
719,0.97,5500.161,5501.529,"Okay, just checking.",116,,
720,0.97,5501.529,5504.265,But that doesn't change what Alicia is saying about her case.,117,,
721,0.97,5504.265,5510.137,"Yes, I just wanted to take a step back and understand how you are running this particular meeting.",118,,
722,0.97,5510.137,5518.346,There is nothing--I do want to say I don't appreciate you insinuating there is something problematic about running the meeting.,119,,
723,0.97,5518.346,5526.821,And it is a Renter who has gone through an absolutely catastrophic experience because of Eviction Renters month.,119,,
724,0.97,5526.821,5543.371,"And I would really appreciate elected officials showing some respect for our constituents, our committee members who have gone through so much because the laws in our city do not protect Renters who are being exploited and who are being sort of thrown through the cracks.",119,,
725,0.97,5543.371,5547.074,"That was not the intent, that was not my intent.",120,,
726,0.97,5547.074,5549.477,"Well, it does come across like that.",121,,
727,0.97,5549.477,5551.212,I wanted to add people to the table.,122,,
728,0.97,5551.212,5557.285,I don't go to other Council member committees and question how they are organized because it is your prerogative as chair.,123,,
729,0.97,5557.285,5561.255,"If I don't politically agree with something, I will just say it, but that's fine.",123,,
730,0.97,5561.255,5563.624,You are free to bring your amendment.,123,,
731,0.97,5563.624,5565.927,But let's have the committee meeting.,123,,
732,0.97,5565.927,5570.831,"Yes, I just wanted to add people to the table and I'm happy to answer the questions, so thank you for the question.",124,,
733,0.97,5570.831,5574.402,But really my intent was to add people to the table.,124,,
734,0.97,5574.402,5576.203,And so that's right.,124,,
735,0.97,5576.203,5591.719,"It had is focused, this amendment would focus on folks who are in homes or apartments funded by the Seattle housing levy, Mfte program, Seattle housing authority if they are getting financial assistance.",124,,
736,0.97,5591.719,5603.497,"And the idea is to start the process, to have a law in place that would prevent these Evictions, supplement that with funding that we would provide emergency assistance.",124,,
737,0.97,5603.497,5620.081,"And to speak to Council member Morales' point, I agree that this is just a Subset that would be within the Eviction restrictions, but we also need to provide financial assistance, so that we can, you know, target the money, people have a need to get that money to you.",124,,
738,0.97,5620.081,5626.587,So I would want to help groups in private market housing.,124,,
739,0.97,5626.587,5637.398,"Well, I just wanted to clarify that the whole idea of mitigation funds, I mean it had are funds that exist and we have had a long discussion about it.",125,,
740,0.97,5637.398,5644.572,But I think it is important for us to recognize that this whole idea of mitigation fund as some sort of an alternative to just laws like this one.,125,,
741,0.97,5644.572,5653.08,"I mean this law alone is not going to protect Renters, but it is a part of the Renters bill of rights that we need.",125,,
742,0.97,5653.08,5665.159,"We have already done the law that protects Renters from being, from facing rent increases when they have outstanding housing code violations.",125,,
743,0.97,5665.159,5671.198,There was a law passed despite the tremendous landlords and the cap plan.,125,,
744,0.97,5671.198,5687.815,"So all of these individual Renters' rights, Legislations we have been passing are hopefully a part of a full Fledge Renters' bill of rights, and so, you know, no one law is going to ensure by itself.",125,,
745,0.97,5687.815,5717.311,"However, these laws are necessary because this idea of mitigation fund is an alternative to all these legal protections for Renters is Premised that Renters are refusing to pay their rents or, you know, that somehow there is some epidemic of Renters not paying their rent, and somehow if we make sure we have some sort of other alternative to make Renters pay the rent, we will be able to solve this problem.",125,,
746,0.97,5717.311,5720.948,The problem is not that Renters don't pay rent as John was saying.,125,,
747,0.97,5720.948,5726.454,Renters move heaven and earth to be able to make the rent because they know they don't want an Eviction.,125,,
748,0.97,5726.454,5733.461,"And we should also keep in mind that it had does not, you know, Rent-Free car or anything.",125,,
749,0.97,5733.461,5741.001,"But this legislation merely says you cannot be evicted except for, you know, certain exceptions that Ali already laid out in the winter months.",125,,
750,0.97,5741.001,5744.238,So in other words this is a question of humanity.,125,,
751,0.97,5744.238,5759.487,"It is a humane law to make sure that people especially with families like Nancy Rankin said, the people who are most impacted are women who rent to families with children.",125,,
752,0.97,5759.487,5766.26,And mitigation funds could not be accessed typically for one or two weeks after the Eviction notice laid out.,125,,
753,0.97,5766.26,5769.363,By that time the families are going to be out in the streets.,125,,
754,0.97,5769.363,5770.931,So it's not an alternative.,125,,
755,0.97,5770.931,5776.003,"I don't think we should allow the public to think it is an alternative, it's actually not.",125,,
756,0.97,5776.003,5776.837,"Go ahead, John.",125,,
757,0.97,5776.837,5795.823,"Yeah, I want to talk about the amendment and the proposal to only limit this to City- owned properties because somehow we should have a means test, so that--rich people aren't getting evicted.",126,,
758,0.97,5795.823,5800.528,We don't have any wealthy people at the tenant's Union coming asking us for help.,126,,
759,0.97,5800.528,5803.497,These are people who are already struggling.,126,,
760,0.97,5803.497,5807.701,So means testing is kind of built in to the Eviction process already.,126,,
761,0.97,5807.701,5810.538,If you think about it because rich people aren't getting evicted.,126,,
762,0.97,5810.538,5814.809,What is the point in it is just another layer of bureaucracy that we do not need.,126,,
763,0.97,5814.809,5817.444,This is completely pointless.,126,,
764,0.97,5817.444,5817.645,Why?,126,,
765,0.97,5817.645,5820.147,There is no point to it at all.,126,,
766,0.97,5820.281,5830.124,"It's true and also the study that we actually covered in my committee last year and some of you, actually none of you were there.",127,,
767,0.97,5830.124,5836.23,"Just very quickly, I will share because you are new incoming Council members.",127,,
768,0.97,5836.23,5845.039,"But a study by Tim Thomas, I think, research professor at the University of Washington.",127,,
769,0.97,5845.039,5858.452,He did a survey that proves statistically what John was just saying that the people who face Eviction are almost entirely extremely low income and vulnerable people.,127,,
770,0.97,5858.452,5864.692,And within that it's African American women who are the most impacted by Evictions.,127,,
771,0.97,5864.692,5876.637,And so I do believe John is making a very important point that means testing is built in to who gets evicted.,127,,
772,0.97,5876.637,5881.175,"I think this sort of addresses one of the questions you raised, which was a good one.",127,,
773,0.97,5881.175,5888.015,I came over to the table to speak to a point that was raised earlier about leases.,128,,
774,0.97,5888.015,5889.049,The question about leases.,128,,
775,0.97,5889.049,5895.522,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but because we have looked into this issue in the past.",128,,
776,0.97,5895.522,5905.165,And so the just cause Eviction ordinance does not help out people who are on a lease at the end of the lease and the landlord doesn't want to renew the lease.,128,,
777,0.97,5905.165,5914.875,"But in terms of if you're in the middle of the lease and you have a health emergency and you don't make your rent, you know, then this law would apply.",128,,
778,0.97,5914.875,5922.549,"Like if you're getting evicted through, you know, any of those normal things, whether or not you have a lease, this would apply.",128,,
779,0.97,5922.549,5931.659,It is just that point about renewing leases at the end of the lease that the whole just cause Eviction structure doesn't just.,128,,
780,0.97,5931.659,5941.602,"And just to add to that, I hope Council member Lewis, that sort of answers one of questions about leased tenants?",129,,
781,0.97,5941.735,5946.04,"Well, let me clarify a little bit.",130,,
782,0.97,5946.04,5969.997,"My understanding from my exchange earlier with central staff was if you were kind of locked in to a 12-month lease, the process that would apply would be the process that the state has provided rent and the just cause.",130,,
783,0.97,5969.997,5984.645,"Lately, you know, if you have entered a lease as a landlord, right, you can't just break the lease unless the tenant is violating some terms, I mean the tenant has rights if you entered into a 12-month lease.",130,,
784,0.97,5984.645,5988.582,I understand how it would apply on a month to month or that situation.,130,,
785,0.97,5988.582,6000.494,I guess I'm just a little unclear still because it doesn't sound like there is really much distinction at all from what the presentation we just heard.,130,,
786,0.97,6000.494,6004.598,I was trying to pull up the full text of the ordinance.,131,,
787,0.97,6004.598,6019.88,"I'm having technical difficulties, but the Seattle Department construction inspection Website says the just cause Eviction ordinance does not Apry to terminating leases that end on a specific date with no right to hold over.",131,,
788,0.97,6019.88,6032.793,"So I will need to confirm what you are saying, and I won't be able to do that on the fly, but I will confirm that.",131,,
789,0.97,6032.793,6040.701,"And so if it is an Eviction due to something that is not a violation of the lease term, you know, it isn't a Month-To- month lease.",131,,
790,0.97,6040.701,6046.573,"I need to get some clarification, and so I will follow up with you tomorrow.",131,,
791,0.97,6046.573,6054.214,To confirm sort of exactly where the line is under what Tenancies this does apply and what circumstances it would not.,131,,
792,0.97,6054.214,6055.983,"Okay, thanks.",132,,
793,0.97,6055.983,6063.223,Because my understanding coming in to this was clearer than where it is right now on that issue.,132,,
794,0.97,6063.223,6067.261,But I do have some other comments if that would be appropriate?,132,,
795,0.97,6067.261,6067.995,"Yes, absolutely.",133,,
796,0.97,6067.995,6087.714,"So I mean one thing I want to clarify to it I think for John and Council member Sawant is, you know, at least my Inquirers, to speak for Council member Pedersen, but my inquiry on the means testing were not necessarily to imply that we have this epidemic of rich people not paying rent.",134,,
797,0.97,6087.714,6111.805,"I think going back to the fact that Council member Pedersen made earlier, you know, the nature of this ordinance and being abroad new law and not being Precedented in the United States does clue us to think about some of the potential implications of the ordinance.",134,,
798,0.97,6111.805,6126.954,I mean one of those could be an exchange and I'm not saying this would happen is that because you could be in a position where you are not at risk of being evicted for not paying rent.,134,,
799,0.97,6126.954,6127.754,People may elect to do so.,134,,
800,0.97,6127.754,6129.89,I do not think they would.,134,,
801,0.97,6129.89,6144.137,But I just wanted to ask some questions about it to central staff and ask them questions about it to my colleagues to ensure we are structuring an ordinance to withstand that kind of scrutiny where people of means are for whatever reason not paying rent.,134,,
802,0.97,6144.137,6151.178,"Again I don't think it's going to happen, but I want to clarify that, you know, I don't anticipate something like that happening.",134,,
803,0.97,6151.178,6168.128,"I do completely respect and understand, again, also as a Renter that means testing is built in to the Eviction process, and that this is a tool that is much more broadly used against folks that are on the margins.",134,,
804,0.97,6168.128,6176.236,"That do not have opportunity under the current system, so I want to make that clear and I did appreciate your comments on that.",134,,
805,0.97,6176.236,6186.847,I think I'm ready to sort of speak more broadly in my thoughts on the amendment and the resolution or the proposed ordinance if that would be appropriate now.,134,,
806,0.97,6186.847,6190.117,And also speaking to the amendment under the question?,135,,
807,0.97,6190.117,6190.651,Yes.,136,,
808,0.97,6190.651,6194.254,"Yes, council member Pedersen's amendment.",137,,
809,0.97,6194.254,6195.722,Go ahead.,137,,
810,0.97,6195.722,6209.036,First I do want to thank Council member Sawant and Council member Sawant's staff throughout the process of discussing this ordinance.,137,,
811,0.97,6209.036,6220.948,I think that you have been very diligent in anticipating possible criticisms of the ordinance in adopting it considerably to the feedback.,137,,
812,0.97,6220.948,6228.155,A lot of the things that I had sort of prepared myself to come to the committee today to propose this potential amendment.,137,,
813,0.97,6228.155,6233.827,And none were actually covered by the substitute ordinance.,137,,
814,0.97,6233.827,6240.701,"I just want to commend, you know, just to central staff, everyone on your team for incorporating those things.",137,,
815,0.97,6240.701,6264.625,I do want to make it clear for the record that some of those amendments that were passed earlier in the substitute bill that are now before the committee did include things like as a former Prosecutor who has seen a lot of Evictions and a lot of folks who have had the criminal activities occur.,137,,
816,0.97,6264.625,6267.127,"Sorry, can you say that again?",138,,
817,0.97,6267.127,6287.814,"Sure, as a Prosecutor who has seen a lot of cases where criminal activity occurred in the concern of the rental unit, it was certainly one of my concerns that potentially you could have an on going criminal enterprise in a unit that is in excellent circumstances for the landlord.",139,,
818,0.97,6287.814,6296.79,"If someone is, you know, cooking Meth in a unit, you can't Evict them for several months.",139,,
819,0.97,6296.79,6304.531,"That would be a big concern, you know, under the current ordinances that we have just proposed that it would not happen.",139,,
820,0.97,6304.531,6309.67,I want to make that clear for everyone who is in the audience and just for the record of the committee.,139,,
821,0.97,6309.67,6316.176,I think that is a real important concession.,139,,
822,0.97,6316.176,6331.692,"There's eight total concessions to imposing an Eviction on folks, well to blocking and defending the Eviction that we have just approved by amending the ordinance.",139,,
823,0.97,6331.692,6345.706,"So you know, I do intend for the purposes of this Committee hearing to vote, to pass that ordinance of the full council.",139,,
824,0.97,6345.706,6360.153,"I still have some questions and some concerns based on my conversation with central staff during this Committee, hearing from the members of the committee who I think made a good and strong point.",139,,
825,0.97,6360.153,6371.231,I commend Council member Pedersen who has some good thoughtful questions about some things that I think some Vulnerabilities of the ordinance that I want to look at potentially with central staff and your office.,139,,
826,0.97,6371.231,6378.271,I would certainly like to look at some kind of a mitigation Fund.,139,,
827,0.97,6378.271,6400.727,"I want to be clear about that, not as an alternative to the ordinance, but as some kind of a mechanism in a case where it would be appropriate to compensate a landlord if there was a long period of time under, well where the Eviction is delayed in April, where it would be a hardship for a small landlord to absorb that cost.",139,,
828,0.97,6400.727,6402.362,I think some kind of --,139,,
829,0.97,6402.362,6405.132,Do you mean built into the ordinance?,140,,
830,0.97,6405.132,6405.365,Yes.,141,,
831,0.97,6405.365,6423.884,"I mean built into the ordinance, you know, I don't know what it would look like and I will talk to Ali about how something like that might be approachable, but it's one of the things Ali did highlight in the memo she sent to us on January 10, the possibility of looking into something like that.",141,,
832,0.97,6423.884,6431.057,Based on my questioning earlier sounds like it would require some potential appropriation.,141,,
833,0.97,6431.057,6454.714,"But again, I don't know the scale or the scope of how many Evictions a year this ordinance would be anticipated to prevent and how many months of rent that would potentially put out a landlord for.",141,,
834,0.97,6454.714,6464.591,So I would like to look into that to see what the fiscal NOTE on something like that might be as the potential amendment.,141,,
835,0.97,6464.591,6473.166,"I definitely want to take a look at, I mean, mostly that.",141,,
836,0.97,6473.166,6484.311,"The question on the other issues were fairly, have been fairly resolved, though I'm going to touch base probably Online with some of those folks to ask a couple more questions.",141,,
837,0.97,6484.311,6488.915,I think we do know.,141,,
838,0.97,6488.915,6497.457,It is clear that 78% of those Americans will live paycheck to paycheck and a lot of those folks are Renters.,141,,
839,0.97,6497.457,6499.96,I'm the only committee member who is a Renter.,141,,
840,0.97,6499.96,6506.933,I have been in situations where I have felt rent burdened earlier in my career.,141,,
841,0.97,6506.933,6512.172,"Not as a professional, but previously.",141,,
842,0.97,6512.172,6519.746,And 50% of Americans today can't absorb $500 or more and don't have the savings to cover that.,141,,
843,0.97,6519.746,6525.952,In a lot of cases that emergency is in rent and they don't have that money to pay for it.,141,,
844,0.97,6525.952,6530.29,And so I do appreciate the spirit in which this ordinance has been brought forward.,141,,
845,0.97,6530.29,6535.562,I appreciate a lot of the Proactive changes that were made.,141,,
846,0.97,6535.562,6548.074,"There's other areas that I want to look to improve upon, but I think for the purposes of this hearing, I am happy to vote to send it forward.",141,,
847,0.97,6548.074,6553.313,I would actually encourage to speak to Council member Pedersen's amendment.,141,,
848,0.97,6553.313,6556.883,I do think his amendment would probably warrant the consideration of the full council as well.,141,,
849,0.97,6556.883,6561.855,I think we should have this conversation with the rest of our colleagues potentially.,141,,
850,0.97,6561.855,6571.097,I think Council member Pedersen would be fully within his rights to reintroduce it when we convene as a full Council for the consideration.,141,,
851,0.97,6571.097,6589.049,"I do think there is some value in talking about a change, a new regulation, unprecedented to advocate for the response.",141,,
852,0.97,6589.049,6616.81,"I know a lot of folks don't like seeing it as a compromise or a retreat, but to speak to Council member Pedersen's intentions, I really do think it is about laying the sound ground work to build overtime, where it is warranted, but I'm happy to continue to have that conversation.",141,,
853,0.97,6616.81,6621.314,"There is still a little more work to be done, but that's how I will be voting tonight.",141,,
854,0.97,6621.314,6626.486,Thank you so much Council member Lewis for your comments.,142,,
855,0.97,6626.486,6642.369,"On your last point, Yeah, the reason I'm not comfortable with the amendment that Council member Pedersen is presented is because most of the data shows most of the Evictions are aware they are happening with the private landlords.",142,,
856,0.97,6642.369,6647.874,"I don't know if you wanted to add anything, John?",142,,
857,0.97,6647.874,6651.878,During this discussion I was able to get some help to get some data.,143,,
858,0.97,6651.878,6680.373,"We don't have the city wide data on the Evictions, who is Evicting the private landlords or if they are operating with the city support, but I can tell you last year our Council office partnered with Seattle to do a whole scale at least with district three to look at each building, each landlord, each apartment even to see about code violations and the other things including Evictions.",143,,
859,0.97,6680.373,6705.765,"What they show in the three years between district three in 2016 through 2018, three of the top four Evictors the landlord were private developers, they thrive with the Evictions and with 163.",143,,
860,0.97,6705.765,6710.603,"Mostly captured by your amendment, maybe.",143,,
861,0.97,6710.603,6714.641,"143, the other private corporate landlord with 117 Evictions.",143,,
862,0.97,6714.641,6718.978,"While I don't have the data, Cornell and Associates, another name that came up.",143,,
863,0.97,6718.978,6725.251,"We were doing a lot of House visits around that time, around rent control.",143,,
864,0.97,6725.251,6729.989,So we went out and talked to people in these buildings.,143,,
865,0.97,6729.989,6748.775,I can tell you they had horrific stories of just neighbors who had been evicted or themselves haven't been evicted in similar circumstances in the previous rentals.,143,,
866,0.97,6748.775,6754.614,And so it is all anonymous that you'll get the Eviction notice and pretty much a death sentence that you need to move.,143,,
867,0.97,6754.614,6764.124,"And so that was at least our experience in data in district three in terms of the data, who has been driving most of the Evictions.",143,,
868,0.97,6764.124,6771.531,I would also note that we did House visits on rent control in district four.,143,,
869,0.97,6771.531,6789.115,"And the primary culprit there, again, I don't have data on this, but the communities, maybe you're familiar with them and big corporate landlords, especially of students and people who work in the University of Washington, they are buying properties up and down that region in that area.",143,,
870,0.97,6789.115,6804.164,And we ran into a lot of stories of students and low and moderate income workers at the University of Washington who had faced Eviction who had friends who faced Evictions and in other buildings.,143,,
871,0.97,6804.164,6804.931,And in the University district.,143,,
872,0.97,6804.931,6810.703,And they were not talking about buildings that were publicly owned or Mfte.,143,,
873,0.97,6810.703,6816.176,"They were talking about purely private arrangements, where no city dollar would touch the property.",143,,
874,0.97,6816.176,6822.549,"And these people, they obviously would not be covered under the amendment that has been proposed.",143,,
875,0.97,6822.549,6824.784,"Council member Sawant, just a quick comment.",144,,
876,0.97,6824.784,6825.785,"Jonathan, thank you for that.",144,,
877,0.97,6825.785,6836.262,"I just wanted to point out though like in fairness, because I remember this article from several years ago, from Seattle's record, the stranger.",144,,
878,0.97,6836.262,6842.702,April 25 of 2019.,144,,
879,0.97,6842.702,6844.871,And by Heidi that detailed this.,144,,
880,0.97,6844.871,6854.514,"I just remember it because of our conversation today that Seattle housing authority, at least in that article, and I'm happy to circulate this.",144,,
881,0.97,6854.514,6867.093,"They did have a very high, I mean that's just one provider of public housing, but they did have a pretty sensational Eviction record.",144,,
882,0.97,6867.093,6881.741,"It looks like in the five years prior to the article, 473 Evictions initiated in the average of two Eviction cases filed per week, sometimes for amounts of money as $49, $155.",144,,
883,0.97,6881.741,6884.344,I did just want to put that into the public record.,144,,
884,0.97,6884.344,6888.448,And I know that in the aggregate that the private market is much bigger.,144,,
885,0.97,6888.448,6893.319,Obviously the private market is going to have far more Evictions.,144,,
886,0.97,6893.319,6919.545,"I think definitely it is appropriate to consider regulation that would cover the private market, but I did just want to put out there that for a matter of the public record today that there is a considerable document and frankly egregious record from the Seattle housing authority of initiating Evictions against folks that are completely indigent, so I just wanted to share that.",144,,
887,0.97,6919.545,6924.384,Thank you Council member Lewis and Council member Morales?,145,,
888,0.97,6924.384,6942.568,"Yes, I just want to say that in my mind it really doesn't Eviction by private King about corporations or if we are talking about Eviction of people from public housing or some public entity or some apartment building that has some small degree of public funding in it.",146,,
889,0.97,6942.568,6954.28,"The point is that people are getting put out on the street, individuals, children, women, people of color, and that is the issue that we are dealing with here.",146,,
890,0.97,6954.28,6969.896,"I think we have to remember that these aren't just statistics, these aren't just percentages and, you know, the issue isn't who is evicted more, but the issue is people are getting evicted during the winter months, we're trying to protect them from that reality.",146,,
891,0.97,6969.896,6982.041,And I think we really need to center the experience of people who have been evicted and who are telling us that this is a traumatic experience that is very hard to recover from.,146,,
892,0.97,6982.041,6996.823,"If we can prevent something like that from happening, then we could potentially keep people into stable housing, repair a relationship hopefully between a tenant and a landlord, and keep a family from getting tossed out onto the streets.",146,,
893,0.97,6996.823,7019.946,"I appreciate that there is more data that we need perhaps to understand the scope of what we're talking about better, to understand the cost of what other programming, other funding we might need to be thinking about, and that should also come with some real strategies for how we're going to find that money and how we're going to provide it.",146,,
894,0.97,7019.946,7027.92,But I don't want us to lose sight of the facts that we're talking about individuals whose lives are ruined for being tossed out onto the streets.,146,,
895,0.97,7027.92,7030.99,That's not to say we also need to protect small landlords.,146,,
896,0.97,7030.99,7038.264,"But whether it is public or private corporations, what we really need to be focused on is keeping people safe.",146,,
897,0.97,7038.264,7041.868,"I really appreciate the points, council member Morales.",147,,
898,0.97,7041.868,7044.17,And you're absolutely right.,147,,
899,0.97,7044.17,7047.874,"It's about people, these are not just objects we're talking about.",147,,
900,0.97,7047.874,7058.151,"And in response to Council member Lewis, thank you for sharing actually, and the stranger did do some good reporting on that.",147,,
901,0.97,7058.151,7061.32,I'm just laughing because you said paper record.,147,,
902,0.97,7061.32,7064.023,[Laughter],147,,
903,0.97,7064.023,7065.825,Yes.,148,,
904,0.97,7065.825,7069.128,And in many ways it probably is.,148,,
905,0.97,7069.128,7071.197,But well you're absolutely right.,148,,
906,0.97,7071.197,7080.64,"I mean first of all just to Council member Morales, it doesn't matter what kind of landlord we are talking about, we need to protect families from being evicted in the winter months.",148,,
907,0.97,7080.64,7086.779,And again that's all this legislation will do and it does not provide every single protection rights.,148,,
908,0.97,7086.779,7093.986,"But on Council member Lewis' point, it is absolutely accurate what you just reported.",148,,
909,0.97,7093.986,7121.347,"And in fact there has been a long track records of the Seattle housing authority being a very sort of cruel landlord and in fact some of you might remember, I don't know if Ali, you were here that time, but in September of 2014 because I mean the Seattle housing authority is not a city authority, but it is hard funded, so it will be a Federal mandate.",148,,
910,0.97,7121.347,7128.721,"The Federal Government instituted a program called stepping forward, going to increase the rent by 400%.",148,,
911,0.97,7128.721,7130.523,And probably more than that.,148,,
912,0.97,7130.523,7131.591,Some people said 500%.,148,,
913,0.97,7131.591,7156.449,"But any way this is yet another egregious example of how the city has been as a landlord, and actually we routinely get Phonecalls from tenants of Seattle who tell us they are being evicted, and I don't know if you are able to address every single thing that we sent them to the tenant's unit, of course, but it seems like there are many cases in which they should not be evicted.",148,,
914,0.97,7156.449,7158.017,And so it is true.,148,,
915,0.97,7158.017,7167.827,"I would also like to point out that I think they pointed out that tenants would not be covered under this amendment if it passes, right?",148,,
916,0.97,7167.827,7173.533,Because it is not a City-Funded public housing?,148,,
917,0.97,7173.533,7184.577,"It may and maybe not to every University, but oftentimes there is the city money in the projects with the housing authority and the variety of ways.",149,,
918,0.97,7184.577,7197.123,"So just to clarify this amendment, it would apply to housing units that would have either in the development or if they are continuing to receive financial assistance from the city.",149,,
919,0.97,7197.123,7214.941,"And so that could include housing developments that are funded, that are built by Non- profits, and then in some cases for the profit developers as well as Mfte units that are in private developments.",149,,
920,0.97,7214.941,7227.653,"And so it is not just--the city doesn't really own housing in and of itself, so it is sort of a--there is a variety of different types of housing developments that it would apply to.",149,,
921,0.97,7227.653,7233.526,"And to exclude, the amendment would still exclude privately-owned?",150,,
922,0.97,7233.526,7239.465,It would exclude Privately- owned housing that isn't participating in the Mfte.,151,,
923,0.97,7239.465,7244.67,"The units are not Mfte units, those are typically in private developments.",151,,
924,0.97,7244.67,7270.563,"So you know, I would say the majority of housing development that receives financial assistance from the city is probably owned by Non-Profits in the Seattle housing authority, but it is not a bright line that there would be no housing units that are owned by For-Profit developers for, you know, private owners that wouldn't be regulated by this.",151,,
925,0.97,7270.563,7271.297,Okay.,152,,
926,0.97,7271.297,7274.8,Let's put it very precisely.,152,,
927,0.97,7274.8,7285.544,"It would exclude all rental units that don't have any kind of city funding or any other city connections, or anything you mentioned?",152,,
928,0.97,7285.544,7292.818,"Yeah, they are units that have received financial assistance and generally had some sort of a regulatory agreement.",153,,
929,0.97,7292.818,7301.227,"So Mfte there is a regulatory agreement on those, excuse me multi-family tax exemption units as well as when the city invests in projects.",153,,
930,0.97,7301.227,7312.238,"There is a regulatory agreement with conditions under which those units could be rented, which typically includes both the rent and income restriction.",153,,
931,0.97,7312.238,7322.214,"But I don't--I mean the way you're saying it though, it gives the impression that it is probably a significant minority or majority of rental units that come under this category.",154,,
932,0.97,7322.214,7335.328,"My understanding is they don't because for the most part the city funding, I mean there's so little funding that you have a Smattering of tenants that fulfill the category you said.",154,,
933,0.97,7335.328,7339.598,I don't want it to be misleading that it is like lots of units.,154,,
934,0.97,7339.598,7348.107,My concern is we have to be very clear this amendment would leave out a majority of Renters out of this protection.,154,,
935,0.97,7348.107,7352.378,"So Yeah, I wasn't trying to make it more vague or anything like that.",155,,
936,0.97,7352.378,7353.946,"No, no, absolutely.",156,,
937,0.97,7353.946,7367.993,"I'm trying to clarify there is not sort of a clear line like non-profit, for profit, who the owner is necessarily, but it is the numbers you were quoting previously.",157,,
938,0.97,7367.993,7378.504,"It is roughly about 17,000 units that would fall under this category, which is about 10% of the rental units.",157,,
939,0.97,7378.504,7379.105,Thank you.,158,,
940,0.97,7379.105,7382.708,Thank you for coming back to that point.,158,,
941,0.97,7382.708,7393.619,"And that is at the correction, nine times out of ten you wouldn't be covered with this legislation if this amendment passes.",158,,
942,0.97,7393.619,7393.886,Go ahead.,158,,
943,0.97,7393.886,7397.022,"I feel like you have given lots of air time to my amendment, I appreciate it.",159,,
944,0.97,7397.022,7400.092,I think it has been explained well from different angles.,159,,
945,0.97,7400.092,7404.163,"I'm happy to just move it, and we could just decide.",159,,
946,0.97,7404.163,7404.597,Sure.,160,,
947,0.97,7404.597,7413.439,"Yes, I would like to move this amendment number two.",161,,
948,0.97,7413.439,7413.839,Second.,162,,
949,0.97,7413.839,7415.04,Thank you.,163,,
950,0.97,7415.04,7418.144,All in favor of the amendment say aye?,164,,
951,0.97,7418.144,7419.445,Aye.,165,,
952,0.97,7419.445,7422.381,All opposed say no?,166,,
953,0.97,7422.381,7427.453,So the amendment does not pass.,166,,
954,0.97,7427.453,7446.672,"I'm not aware of any amendments at this point, so I would like to move--so sorry before I say that, before I call the question, council member Lewis, you mentioned several things that you would like to look at.",166,,
955,0.97,7446.672,7459.718,Would you be okay with my office and yours with the help of central staff sort of working on those things before we come to the full council vote by voting it?,166,,
956,0.97,7459.718,7462.421,I'm about to call it for vote in the committee?,166,,
957,0.97,7462.421,7477.102,"Yes, as I said in my comments earlier, I think that would be acceptable, given a lot of the changes that were made in the substitute ordinance.",167,,
958,0.97,7477.102,7491.65,"And so Yeah, but my intent, especially since we have--my understanding is the preferred schedule from the chair that would be two weeks instead of referring it on for next Monday.",167,,
959,0.97,7491.65,7493.285,Given that there is the two weeks.,167,,
960,0.97,7493.285,7509.435,"It might have been a little different if the turnaround was quicker, but given there is two weeks, I don't have an objection to that and it gives a chance for all of our colleagues on the full Council to kind of let this sink in a little bit too.",167,,
961,0.97,7509.435,7513.105,I would vote to move it forward today.,167,,
962,0.97,7513.105,7513.372,Okay.,168,,
963,0.97,7513.372,7517.877,Thank you so much for the clarification.,169,,
964,0.97,7517.877,7521.647,And so let me know if I'm not doing this right.,169,,
965,0.97,7521.647,7534.393,"But I move Council bill 119276 version two for a vote by committee to come to--actually I don't have to say that part right now, right?",169,,
966,0.97,7534.393,7534.727,Correct.,170,,
967,0.97,7534.727,7544.169,So you are moving the bill as amended for consideration of the full Council on February 3.,170,,
968,0.97,7544.169,7549.475,Can I get a second?,171,,
969,0.97,7549.475,7549.808,Second.,172,,
970,0.97,7549.808,7554.513,"All in favor of the bill as amended and coming to full Council, say aye.",172,,
971,0.97,7554.513,7554.78,Aye.,173,,
972,0.97,7554.78,7557.917,All opposed?,174,,
973,0.97,7557.917,7558.884,Sustain.,175,,
974,0.97,7558.884,7564.056,"Okay, we have three ayes and one sustained.",176,,
975,0.97,7564.056,7567.826,So the winter moratorium bill will pass to Committee.,176,,
976,0.97,7567.826,7572.731,We will be working with all your offices to see what additions you want to make.,176,,
977,0.97,7573.265,7580.039,I thank all Council members for their full participation and once again for coming at an evening time.,176,,
978,0.97,7580.039,7584.143,"I know it's 8:00, so I want to thank you once again.",176,,
979,0.97,7584.143,7594.587,"And thank you Presenters, Alicia, thank you very much for sharing your personal story, and John, and please say thank you to everyone in the tenant's Union.",176,,
980,0.97,7594.587,7596.155,Thank you for all your work.,176,,
981,0.97,7596.155,7601.86,I apologize if I was trying to get it in a way that makes sense to me.,176,,
982,0.97,7601.86,7606.432,"But I appreciate you have to be very precise and detailed, that's your job.",176,,
983,0.97,7606.432,7607.733,That is very much appreciated.,176,,
984,0.97,7607.733,7612.338,Thanks to my staff as well and everybody who came for public comment.,176,,
985,0.97,7612.338,7615.574,"Unless there are any other comments, meeting is adjourned.",176,,
986,0.97,7615.574,7616.175,Thank you.,176,,
987,0.97,7616.175,7620.012,Thank you.,177,,
