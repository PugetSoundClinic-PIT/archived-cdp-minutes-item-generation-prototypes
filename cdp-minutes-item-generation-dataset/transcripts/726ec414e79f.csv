152,0.97,1023.555,1035.634,"Well, I'm not going to lie, when I first came into office two years ago I was a little intimidated by Council President Gonzalez.",24,,
153,0.97,1035.634,1043.142,"But, then Covid sent us all home, and the Newbies had about 60 days under our belts.",24,,
154,0.97,1043.142,1052.05,"So, I reached out to Lorena many times in those first few months really just to understand procedure.",24,,

196,0.97,1290.389,1302.834,"I just want to take a moment to express similar to Councilmember Morales, that four of us showed up almost the majority of this Council, and had only really gosh, 60 days sounds like it was longer.",30,,
197,0.97,1302.834,1304.336,Than what it actually was.,30,,
198,0.97,1304.336,1308.04,It was actually 60 days.,30,,
199,0.97,1308.04,1308.573,That's phenomenal.,30,,
200,0.97,1308.573,1311.91,"But however many days it was, not many, to sort of get settled in.",30,,
201,0.97,1311.91,1322.954,"And to learn how to be a city Councilmember, and to learn how to settle in and work with eight other colleagues to get something done.",30,,
202,0.97,1322.954,1333.398,It has just been really a rewarding experience to get a case study in someone leading in the middle of an unprecedented crisis.,30,,
203,0.97,1333.398,1340.872,And a crisis that none of your predecessors in recent memory have had to deal with.,30,,
204,0.97,1340.872,1343.975,Hopefully none of your successors too far into the future will have to deal with.,30,,
205,0.97,1343.975,1367.999,"But to have wasted on you a once in a century pandemic, as well as an unprecedented series of protests for a long overdue racial reckoning, and really Wading into that space with some policy that has really moved the ball forward in a lot of ways.",30,,
206,0.97,1367.999,1376.308,I think that no one would disagree that Seattle has been seen as a national best practice in response to the Covid crisis.,30,,
207,0.97,1376.308,1386.918,"That is due in no small part to leading with best practices on public health and community engagement, and bringing people together and overcoming vaccine hesitancy.",30,,
208,0.97,1386.918,1402.2,"It was just really good in my first couple of months to be able to see like Okay, this is how someone brings together people who don't agree on a lot of other stuff, but agree that we need to get through this crisis.",30,,

222,0.97,1484.115,1492.123,For you to give me that grace to do so.,32,,
223,0.97,1492.123,1495.594,"I look forward to working with you in the future, whatever's next.",32,,

232,0.97,1515.914,1523.088,"Before we do that, I wasn't planning on making any--I don't have any prepared remarks, which is always dangerous.",33,,
233,0.97,1523.088,1537.269,"[Laughter] But I do, I do just from--just from the bottom of my heart, really express my gratitude to each of you for your friendship.",33,,

237,0.97,1551.85,1573.972,"Those are moments of growth and opportunities to be humble and to continue to build the resilience amongst this entity that I continue to have--the Seattle city Council has led on many issues throughout its history, and in the last six years I've been on the Council, we have become younger.",33,,
238,0.97,1573.972,1575.507,More diverse racially.,33,,
239,0.97,1575.507,1581.112,"And by gender, and also by economic status.",33,,
240,0.97,1581.112,1597.629,"I think that that would happen, we also began to lift up more diverse public policy issues to truly address the needs of those who are most vulnerable in our communities.",33,,
241,0.97,1597.629,1601.733,They had frankly been neglected for many generations and decades before all of us arrived to this seat.,33,,
242,0.97,1601.733,1608.907,"Since I have been a Councilmember, not only has the Council changed, but I have personally and profoundly changed.",33,,
243,0.97,1608.907,1627.058,"I have fallen in love and got married to the love of my life, Cameron Williams, who continues to support me unconditionally in this incredibly taxing and trying job that doesn't allow us to really go to the grocery store without anonymity anymore.",33,,
244,0.97,1627.058,1640.972,"And for his love and his support, and for his counsel and his advice and making sure that I always stay centered, to who I am and what we want, the city and the world to be, I'm Eternally grateful.",33,,

248,0.97,1658.59,1693.725,"It has been a true honor to not only lead in the last two years as a woman of color, but as a First-Time mom, and breaking barriers and stereotypes of what it means to have Positional power, and also lean into your motherhood and show up at April Council Zero-Based meeting and preside over a complex meeting during unprecedented public health crisis, and a racial reckoning that we have not experienced in our lifetime, while also Breast- feeding and nursing.",33,,
249,0.97,1693.725,1699.03,"And, I also suffered profound loss in the last two years.",33,,

252,0.97,1707.639,1710.341,In that same fire.,33,,
253,0.97,1710.341,1724.522,All of you just showed up and rallied for me and sent flowers and food and helped us move into our new place and offered trucks and diapers and clothes.,33,,
254,0.97,1724.522,1733.765,And just love and affection and I am grateful to each of you.,33,,
255,0.97,1733.765,1755.587,"It's easy to get lost in the policy debates and the fights and the arguments that we have day today, publicly and privately, about differences of opinions on a particular bill or an amendment, but the thing I will never be Conflicted about is how valuable my friendship with each of you is, and will continue to be.",33,,
256,0.97,1755.587,1767.699,"I really look forward to seeing what all of you do on the city Council, and I am looking forward to being just an ordinarily engaged citizen in the city of Seattle if you can believe it.",33,,
257,0.97,1767.699,1770.802,I don't think many of you can believe that.,33,,
258,0.97,1770.802,1779.878,"[Laughter] I don't have any big announcements to make today about what's next, but I know I'm excited about what's next.",33,,

563,0.97,3468.898,3474.771,Each of the last five mayors has promised significant reductions in our carbon emissions.,81,,

566,0.97,3484.714,3493.59,Several major decisions are just the beginning of the destruction in store for us.,81,,
567,0.97,3493.59,3507.237,"A select Committee on climate can elevate this issue and coordinate actions to actually meet Seattle's 2030 climate goals, provide accountability and transparency to the public, and finally provide the climate change we need.",81,,

590,0.97,3653.182,3661.057,"Upon researching further, we realized that they had not been Seismically upgraded because there was no city mandate to do so.",86,,
591,0.97,3661.057,3664.861,And no supporting program to help building owners navigate the process and fund the work.,86,,
592,0.97,3664.861,3679.509,We also know the suspect buildings--low income and Bipoc residents and small businesses and were home to a significant proportion of the city's affordable housing stock and a number of schools.,86,,

606,0.97,3737.366,3741.671,Removing hazard pay makes it even more of a financial hardship for people to take time off when they are sick.,88,,
607,0.97,3741.671,3748.077,"We are going to see more people coming into sick, and if we are relying entirely on a vaccine, another safety measure has been rolled back.",88,,

977,0.97,5992.72,6004.631,"At the beginning of this year and 2021, one of our first acts as a Council was to move and pass the legislation I sponsored to pass emergency legislation to provide hazard pay for grocery workers.",183,,
978,0.97,6004.631,6014.908,"Requiring grocery stores to pay employees an additional four dollars per hour to compensate them for the risks to their health and safety, and the health and safety of their families, especially before any vaccines were available.",183,,
979,0.97,6014.908,6022.716,"At the beginning of the pandemic, many industries were able to go remote to produce ours, reduce exposure and more.",183,,
980,0.97,6022.716,6029.857,"Essential workers, especially in grocery stores, who help to feed families and keep family safe had no choice but to report to work.",183,,
981,0.97,6029.857,6044.338,"Many of these grocery workers called in to testify about the health and safety risks that they were facing, including unmasked customers, extra cleaning and frequency needed to clean services throughout grocery stores.",183,,
982,0.97,6044.338,6051.678,These stories included examples of customers coughing or arguing about masks and more.,183,,
983,0.97,6051.678,6061.889,"We didn't just hear about this during public comment, we also had a panel to provide data and study after study to look at opportunities to protect grocery workers.",183,,
984,0.97,6061.889,6072.699,"One study from Boston found that 20% of grocery store workers tested positive for Covid-19, despite 91% of those employees wearing a face mask.",183,,
985,0.97,6072.699,6081.875,The positive rate of infection among grocery store workers was five times as likely for those who interact with customers than those who did not.,183,,
986,0.97,6081.875,6094.021,"While hazard pay cannot fix all of those, situations, it certainly was one measure that this Council wanted to make sure to advance to provide a small boost to workers who were taking these extra risks.",183,,
987,0.97,6094.021,6098.192,We pride ourselves in Seattle of being leaders on labor standards.,183,,
988,0.97,6098.192,6111.905,"And it wasn't just us who recognized this risk . at the time of the bill's passage, cities and had were beginning to announce legislative efforts to announce as a pay workers.",183,,

990,0.97,6122.349,6127.488,"One Seattle city council passed a, we were also an impetus for cities in this region and our County to pass hazard pay as well.",183,,
991,0.97,6127.488,6133.227,"This legislation was always temporary, before Vaccinations could be widely available.",183,,
992,0.97,6133.227,6139.266,And before other safety measures could be secured and discussed with employers.,183,,
993,0.97,6139.266,6156.884,"This legislation was not intended to be permanent wage replacement, which of course I support and have been advocating for, and will continue to work with members of the Spw 21 and other workers who are on the front lines to secure higher wages for all workers, especially in low-wage industries.",183,,
994,0.97,6156.884,6164.892,In our passage of the hazard pay we noted our intent was to consider modifying or eliminating the hazard pay requirements after four months of implementation.,183,,
995,0.97,6164.892,6170.797,And review current health and safety and economic risks for front-line workers for the Covid urgency.,183,,
996,0.97,6170.797,6186.68,"To help us with these considerations on June 15th, we had a panel discussion of representatives from grocery workers, the grocery industry, representatives as well as public health, the interim director was present with us in that meeting.",183,,
997,0.97,6186.68,6197.724,"We celebrated the progress that we've made since Covid-19 pandemic started, we have celebrated and acknowledged the work that had gone into making sure that vaccines were more available since the passage of hazard pay.",183,,
998,0.97,6197.724,6206.633,"We also acknowledged some of the real racial disparities in vaccine rates and the need for ongoing measures, including improved protocols, Ppe access, clear mask guidelines and more.",183,,
999,0.97,6206.633,6217.744,"During the panel, as well as after, we got a good response from grocery store workers that they would continue to work with us on addressing those solutions.",183,,
1000,0.97,6217.744,6227.754,And that includes grocery store employers and employees who were interested in longer-term solutions to addressing these disparities.,183,,
1001,0.97,6227.754,6241.535,During the panel we also heard about partnerships with King County public health to host grocery store worker vaccination clinics and I had the honor of volunteering at one of those clinics early on in the pandemic vaccines first became available and grocery store workers had access to those Vaccinations.,183,,
1002,0.97,6241.535,6255.582,"Based on data, that we held the final passage of the amendment to repeal the grocery store worker hazard pay requirements from July until now.",183,,
1003,0.97,6255.582,6260.087,"Indefinitely, the language we use for when a bill will not be brought up within a 60 day period.",183,,
1004,0.97,6260.087,6264.791,"Although I am bringing this amendment forward today, I want to be clear about a few things.",183,,
1005,0.97,6264.791,6272.399,"Number one, we will consider hazard pay again for grocery store workers and other workers, if needed, on any new public health data that continues to make itself available.",183,,
1006,0.97,6272.399,6278.772,"Number two, this hazard pay legislation is not a substitute for long-term pay and benefits for workers.",183,,
1007,0.97,6278.772,6286.813,"Those are conversations we will continue to engage in, and encourage between the employer and the worker and worker representatives.",183,,
1008,0.97,6286.813,6308.335,"Number three, this legislation would not have been possible without the direct advocacy of UFCW 21 and grocery store workers calling me and asking for us to do this over the holiday break, which we quickly worked with those workers and all of you on Council to pass the hazard pay requirement and work to implement it as soon A█ possible.",183,,
1009,0.97,6308.335,6320.047,"This also would have been possible without the willingness of grocery store employers to advise us on administrative functions, and without a collaboration of public health Seattle King County and the Mayor's office.",183,,
1010,0.97,6320.047,6330.924,"Finally, thanks to the deep engagement that we did with UFCW 21 and the groceries, I'm proud that hazard pay has stemmed a conversation between them around longer-term wins and policy improvements.",183,,
1011,0.97,6330.924,6340.4,These will yield a Longer- lasting and higher level of investment and worker safety and respect beyond the temporary ordinance.,183,,
1012,0.97,6340.4,6348.742,This will continue to have beneficial impacts for those grocery store workers through the conversations that employers and worker representatives are engaged in.,183,,
1013,0.97,6348.742,6362.656,"I will also note that of all the California jurisdictions that I noted, when they passed their hazard pay legislation, earlier this year, those California cities only kept their hazard pay in effect for 120 days.",183,,
1014,0.97,6362.656,6382.376,"So already, in the city of Seattle, we have hazard pay that has lasted twice as long as these California jurisdictions, a full year will be in effect given that the implementation date of this legislation in front of us will not be in effect until January.",183,,
1015,0.97,6382.376,6390.784,I am proud that Seattle workers have gotten this hazard pay for so much longer than these other cities and jurisdictions.,183,,
1016,0.97,6390.784,6395.489,"I'd like to thank all of you for your swift action, and your support to pass this at the beginning of the year.",183,,
1017,0.97,6395.489,6408.935,"I'd like to continue to lift up the work that is going to have lasting impact in the conversations that UFCW 21 and the grocers are having sparked by the need for additional safety, training and investments in workers.",183,,
1018,0.97,6408.935,6412.239,That all of us can be proud of.,183,,
1019,0.97,6412.239,6427.22,"At this time after talking with public health Seattle King County, we know the best way to continue to prevent Covid, especially preventing Omicron, is to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate, and keep those masks on.",183,,
1020,0.97,6427.22,6430.724,I'm proud that Seattle workers have been able to keep this hazard pay for a full year.,183,,
1021,0.97,6430.724,6443.837,This was temporary in nature and I am thankful that there is going to be a lasting benefit from these conversations beyond just the hazard pay that will result in improved protections and safety going forward.,183,,
1022,0.97,6443.837,6447.14,I want to thank you member of my office who has been working on this.,183,,

1173,0.97,7589.114,7602.127,This year has represented a much more robust process than usual as emphasized by the 15 amendments that were proposed and the 14 changes that were included in the base legislation.,236,,
1174,0.97,7602.127,7612.905,I want to thank you all for your engagements on making sure that we get the Council rules set on the right track for the next two years.,236,,
1175,0.97,7612.905,7620.045,There are many good policy changes in this resolution but perhaps the most notable change to the Council rules relates to the Council meeting schedule.,236,,
1176,0.97,7620.045,7628.554,I am very pleased that the committee adopted amendments to the Council rules that will shift our regular Council briefings time Mondays at 2:00 P.M.,236,,

1179,0.97,7641.634,7656.281,"I believe that this change will reduce the sometimes enormous amount of work that is required of Councilmembers on Saturdays and Sundays, including staff members in the city clerk's office and our I.T.",236,,
1180,0.97,7656.281,7670.396,Department and support staff including our deputy city clerk's . It is critical for Council briefing and city council meetings to occur effectively and efficiently.,236,,
1181,0.97,7670.396,7707.599,"As a year-round governing body, and particularly following the last two incredibly challenging years in which we have done our work entirely remotely, we have to acknowledge the limits on our individual and collective capacity and remember that we are in a Marathon, not a Sprint . I am hopeful that this particular change along with others in the package including electronic participation, including voting on resolutions and other really important amendments on the Council rules can help create a more efficient and effective and sustainable legislative process within this legislative body.",236,,
1182,0.97,7707.599,7711.303,There were a few proposed changes to the Council rules the committee decided to take backup the amendments today.,236,,
1183,0.97,7711.303,7726.251,Those are the amendments that we will be considering during this discussion now . I do want to make sure I am facilitating the process for folks to be able to consider these amendments.,236,,
1184,0.97,7726.251,7779.938,I am going to go ahead and ask folks to reserve comment on the rules as a whole until we have considered all the amendments and we will focus our comments now and our discussion now on various amendments that are going to be discussed . All consistent with the comments and discussion and deliberation we had in the Governance and education committee meeting last week on December 8. I am not aware of any new amendments being proposed so these are sort of modifications and revisions or enhancements to policy issues or choices that have already been discussed publicly in two committee hearings . This is our opportunity to make a final policy and decision on some of these proposed amendments related to how the Council will do business over the next two years.,236,,
1185,0.97,7779.938,7785.177,"The first amendment is going to be amendment eight to, an amendment that I am sponsoring with Councilmember Pedersen.",236,,
1186,0.97,7785.177,7794.353,I am going to move to amend resolution 32029 by adopting amendment 82 that was recently distributed.,236,,

1188,0.97,7795.32,7795.821,Second.,237,,
1189,0.97,7795.821,7820.012,"A sponsor of the amendment, I will make sure to address it first and I will provide Councilmember Pedersen an opportunity to address the item and then we will go ahead and open it up for public comment from the rest of our colleagues.",238,,
1190,0.97,7820.012,7834.459,The Governance and education committee took action on December 8 two adopt an amendment sponsored by Councilmember Peterson . I--he authored it . I was the official sponsor.,238,,
1191,0.97,7834.459,7850.776,This amendment would allow Councilmembers to abstain from Council votes on resolutions that were referred either to the Council directly or to most standing and select committees.,238,,
1192,0.97,7850.776,7864.189,Councilmembers would not be allowed to abstain from Council votes on resolutions that come to the Council with recommendations from the select budget committee based on discussions of various options.,238,,
1193,0.97,7864.189,7880.739,The amendment before us would allow Councilmembers to abstain on any resolution in the discretion of the Council President does not pertain materially to the city of Seattle.,238,,
1194,0.97,7880.739,7908.5,"As we discussed during the Governance and education committee meeting, this amendment would not preclude the placement of a resolution on the introduction and referral calendar but rather would simply signal to Councilmembers that they now have three different ways they can vote on a resolution at full council.",238,,
1195,0.97,7908.5,7952.778,"I can either vote yes, vote no, or abstain . that is the effect of the resolution that would be before us . We are switching from the base resolution that included Councilmember Pedersen's language that identified that they Councilmember may only abstain from a resolution that was coming from the select budget committee to making it a little bit more broader to say that they Councilmember may abstain from a resolution at full council if the resolution is determined by the Council President does not materially pertain to the city of Seattle's business.",238,,
1196,0.97,7952.778,7978.77,"That is the proposed amendment before us . I am happy to answer any questions about the substantive amendment which is fairly simple, I think, and provides an opportunity to abstain on only those resolutions that the Council President determines are not materially related to the city of Seattle's business.",238,,
1197,0.97,7978.77,7985.477,"Councilmember Pedersen, would you like to make any additional comments?",238,,
1198,0.97,7985.477,8007.599,"Just briefly, it was fun working with you and your office on this amendment . I appreciate bringing this option forward to give Councilmembers additional flexibility and choice to abstain on these types of resolutions . This brings us closer to the borders Standard and what other Washington cities are doing.",239,,
1199,0.97,8007.599,8010.836,I appreciate collaborating with you on this.,239,,
1200,0.97,8010.836,8011.837,Thank you so much.,240,,

1203,0.97,8025.05,8067.492,"I'm so sorry to do this but even though I really like the direction that things were moving in in Committee, trying to define the types of resolutions that Councilmembers were seeking the opportunity to abstain on, I feel more confident--for instance, the ability to abstain on resolutions that relate to international relations . that is language that I don't think there would be any unintended consequences with.",241,,
1204,0.97,8067.492,8110.402,"I am concerned about the unintended consequences of saying the Council taking an action to say that something is not city business . I just recently and working through my thinking on that with some assistance from the city law Department . given the concerns I have about the potential unintended consequences, I am not going to be able to vote in favor of this amendment although I did really like the direction it was moving in.",241,,

1233,0.97,8197.122,8211.937,I am glad to have this opportunity to bring forward an amendment that speaks to the consideration of how we will be returning to our building in the coming year and doing the public's business.,264,,

The intent of the amendment underscores that when we are returning to our civic building, it is important that we take advantage of the lessons that we learn during the pandemic and that robust electronic participation is possible.",264,,
1236,0.97,8260.085,8292.217,"Previously, council rules allowed for electronic participation in a very specific, very narrow set of circumstances . We have been able to do electronic participation throughout the pandemic only because of the governor's executive order related to the pandemic . The current proposal state a preference for conducting business in person but it also allows for electronic participation whenever technically feasible for any reason.",264,,
1237,0.97,8292.217,8304.629,It asks Councilmembers to communicate well with the Council President's office and allow staff to plan ahead by providing 48 hours advanced notice of electronic participation when they can do so.,264,,

1249,0.97,8371.296,8395.787,It is really important to get this right with the Covid-19 pandemic . We have seen so many times were public health and equity reasons might cause a Councilmember to not be able to participate in person and we appreciate this legislation in front of us today helps to make sure no one is choosing between doing their job and ensuring broader participation in the public deliberations of our work and protecting the public's health as well.,266,,
1250,0.97,8395.787,8398.423,Thank you so much for all of the collaboration.,266,,

1252,0.97,8406.131,8415.84,Are there any additional comments on amendment B? I will just say thank you so much to both of you for working together.,267,,
1253,0.97,8415.84,8446.971,We had a really robust conversation about it during the Governance and education committee and I am glad you had an opportunity to work off-line and thread the needle in a manner that meets the goals of flexibility and safety and an opportunity to allow our technical staff to really have the opportunity to facilitate the needs of Councilmembers who may want to or need to continue to meet in a hybrid fashion.,267,,
1254,0.97,8446.971,8448.973,I appreciate your collective work on that.,267,,
1255,0.97,8448.973,8449.374,Anything else?,267,,

1257,0.97,8452.277,8455.88,Let's see here.,267,,
1258,0.97,8455.88,8461.286,Will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of the proposed amendment B?,267,,
1259,0.97,8461.286,8471.729,[roll being called],268,,
1260,0.97,8479.07,8483.107,"Eight in favor, none opposed.",269,,

1266,0.97,8509.934,8511.135,Thank you so much.,273,,

1270,0.97,8519.043,8524.949,This amendment was redistributed to add increased clarification regarding the amendment.,274,,
1271,0.97,8524.949,8535.126,I will say that these rules are already in place because our Council rules refer to the rules of order as far as deliberations are concerned.,274,,
1272,0.97,8535.126,8542.834,This is just taking the rules of order and putting them in our rules so that we know what we are supposed to be doing.,274,,
1273,0.97,8542.834,8556.848,This amendment would limit Councilmembers to 10 minutes per speech promotion . The rules resolution already States that Council members are limited to two speeches promotion.,274,,
1274,0.97,8556.848,8558.283,That limit does not include questions.,274,,
1275,0.97,8558.283,8591.816,"This 10 minute limit is already stated within the rules of order which apply wherever Council rules are silent . This amendment would restate the 10 minute rule for clarity and emphasis . In Committee, I proposed the same amendment but to limit debate to five minutes per Councilmember promotion because I figured if we requested the public to address us within two minutes, we can do it in five . The amendment failed so this amendment would set the limit at 10 minutes as included in Roberts rules.",274,,
1276,0.97,8591.816,8600.224,Version 2 which was distributed just before this meeting simply changes the world voice to unanimous consent . Thank you Council President.,274,,

1291,0.97,8639.33,8659.65,I appreciate the clarification we have received from central staff and the clerk's office about the ability to answer questions directed at a Councilmember . It does not count toward the full 10 minute allotments.,280,,
1292,0.97,8659.65,8669.927,I also appreciate that there is work being done for this amendment which puts this recommendation in the affirmative.,280,,
1293,0.97,8669.927,8678.903,We will automatically assume that we are going to have these 10 minute allotments versus having the body boat to support it.,280,,
1294,0.97,8678.903,8688.913,I think that will help with a number of items and appreciate that there is some flexibility if the body decides to vote otherwise.,280,,

1392,0.97,9622.846,9628.352,The legislation does allow for possibility of future affordable housing development in the overlay if that were to occur.,315,,
1393,0.97,9628.352,9636.259,There would be strong protections for existing residents.,315,,

1672,0.97,11410.999,11427.149,The impact of the amendment relates to a mandatory language that counsel President Gonzales passed into the legislation during the committee meeting last week creating a 90 day notice requirement for material changes to the program.,434,,
1673,0.97,11427.149,11443.064,"This would alter the language to be a notification to the counsel of such changes within 90 days of implementation, rather than Hoarding it as 90 days before implementation.",434,,

1675,0.97,11470.759,11482.17,"I do not believe the practical effect of the amendment will be that a significant, though it is possible that it could certainly create a looser notification requirement than the current language.",434,,
1676,0.97,11482.17,11501.89,You'll only thing important thing indicated herewith it there would be an expectation notification and I am sure that is going to be something that the counsel would be very assertive about in making sure that there is a close consultation on how the investments are being spent.,434,,
1677,0.97,11501.89,11522.844,"So this is the preferred language from the law just to make sure that we do not inadvertently run afoul with the Charter and I do believe Erring on the side of being cautious and staying within our oversight and due diligence Lane, the language is more appropriate modification of the legislation.",434,,
1678,0.97,11522.844,11526.314,"With that, I do not have anything else to add.",434,,
1679,0.97,11526.314,11528.984,Slack they can so much Councilmember Lewis.,434,,

1706,0.97,11658.747,11661.282,Councilmember Lewis commanded,450,,
1707,0.97,11661.282,11662.751,"Thank you, Madam President.",451,,
1708,0.97,11662.751,11670.725,Right we have been discussing this a lot limit excessive statement of reasons I want to cover some of the top ones again.,451,,
1709,0.97,11670.725,11692.113,"As I alluded to in my remarks before the amendment, I do think that the timing has been somewhat unfortunate given that this legislation appears Decoupled from our budget which is has invited all sorts of strange interpretations and strange Bedfellows opposing more Trans parents he is losing including a daily newspaper.",451,,
1710,0.97,11692.113,11704.959,I would say that I do too much emphasize the coupling of the legislation with the unprecedented additional investments in the city attorney's office.,451,,
1711,0.97,11704.959,11723.912,"This incoming city attorney is going to have more resources available than any of her predecessors including new positions to facilitate the collection and dissemination of data, which this legislation is structured to complement.",451,,
1712,0.97,11723.912,11731.619,This is not some new mandate on top of existing resources.,451,,
1713,0.97,11731.619,11744.733,"This is new requirements for the office strictly related to personnel increases and funding increases that we just put in to the budget, with something like this in mind at the time.",451,,
1714,0.97,11744.733,11746.434,I think that is important to emphasize.,451,,
1715,0.97,11746.434,11754.743,That is a $38.5 million budget that the city attorney's office will have 420 22.,451,,
1716,0.97,11754.743,11770.725,It is a nine percent increase from the previous and certainly warranted given the situation that we are in as a city and the need to make sure that all of our offices that engage in public safety work can be successful.,451,,
1717,0.97,11770.725,11782.737,The application that a this counsel is being insufficiently support supportive of the incoming office is frankly just not not borne out by the statement made by the budget that we just passed earlier this month.,451,,
1718,0.97,11782.737,11798.987,"So I wanted to signify that despite the tension over the course of the last week regarding this legislation, I remain dedicated to working with the incoming city attorney to address a lot of chronic issues in the city.",451,,
1719,0.97,11798.987,11813.168,The data transparency is going to be a big part of allowing the counsel and the city attorney to work together to really refine and address the best strategies to address some of our public safety challenges.,451,,
1720,0.97,11813.168,11821.276,And it is my hope that we can move forward in that spirit despite this a disagreement over this legislation this week.,451,,
1721,0.97,11821.276,11822.243,"With that, I do not have",451,,
