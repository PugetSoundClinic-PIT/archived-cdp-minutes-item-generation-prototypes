46,0.97,302.702,324.457,I am executive director of per choice Washington and we are the leading organization focus specifically on political and legislative advocacy to advance reproductive freedom in Washington state . We been organizing in communities for nearly 50 years to take down the barriers for abortion access and to prepare for the moment we find ourselves in today.,9,,
47,0.97,324.457,343.476,"Thank you Councilmember Morales and Herbold for your leadership on this critical issue where talking about today, and all of you in this committee supporting this work . We deeply appreciate your continued commitment to ensure that everyone has abortion access in Seattle that needs it.",9,,
48,0.97,343.476,350.316,We are grateful to live in a city and state that recognizes that abortion is health care.,9,,
49,0.97,350.316,353.753,The social economic impact of banning abortion are astronomical.,9,,
50,0.97,353.753,362.762,This important legislation affirms state law by Codifying protection for patients and health care facilities at the city level.,9,,
51,0.97,362.762,372.438,This with continued investment on abortion funding and local clinics to meet the unprecedented patient needs we are facing are crucial.,9,,
52,0.97,372.438,397.029,Even with lawmaker support and years of activism patients in Washington continue to face barriers to receiving quality care and this will only be exacerbated when we face a nearly four times increase in patients seeking care from Out- Of-State here in Washington . We also know that it has taken a great deal of work and time to ensure that data protects abortion today.,9,,
53,0.97,397.029,408.808,It is all of our responsibilities as individuals to continue to make it easier for everyone to get care and to speak openly and Unapologetically about the importance of abortion as health care.,9,,
54,0.97,408.808,426.993,"Even in a city and state police in abortion care patients face cost and transportation barriers, biases within the health care system, rampant and Digital Harassment, and continue stigma of seeking care.",9,,
55,0.97,426.993,440.106,"We must continue to work on ensuring quality care for everyone, and even now patients in hospitals across the state are dying died, denied critical care due to hospital policies.",9,,
56,0.97,440.106,447.547,That includes actively Miscarrying patients that come here seeking care from other states.,9,,
57,0.97,447.547,449.148,We are supposed to be the safety net.,9,,
58,0.97,449.148,464.197,Over the past decade under regulated health systems emerging in Washington leading to fewer and more expensive reproductive health care options and particularly in rural communities and King County as well.,9,,
59,0.97,464.197,472.305,"Today at nearly 50% of hospital beds set within facilities with restrictive policies, 26% increase from the last decade.",9,,
60,0.97,472.305,486.385,This has resulted in near death experiences for patience and consequences for medical providers working to provide the best standards of care.,9,,
61,0.97,486.385,493.993,We must continue to hold a hospitals to the high standards of care and ensure that mergers do not result in a loss of patient light or denial of care for those seeking services from out-of-state.,9,,
62,0.97,493.993,497.196,We also need to do more to ensure that patients receive accurate information.,9,,
63,0.97,497.196,512.044,Crisis pregnancy centers or clinics are intentionally set up to look like real clinics and many are located directly next to real reproductive health clinics and specifically targeting low income and communities of color and young people.,9,,
64,0.97,512.044,529.729,Because the Cpcs rarely are Curate and early signs of dangerous medical issues May and have been missed.,9,,
65,0.97,529.729,548.414,We are also seeing a rise in privacy concerns with the laws in other states actively seeking to Persecute people in Washington for a variety of care to patients from their States and unlike medical clinics the Cpcs are not required to keep your personal and medical information confidential.,9,,
66,0.97,548.414,558.324,The personal information gathered by Cpcs could be used as evidence in civil or criminal cases against people getting an abortion or that help them get abortions.,9,,
67,0.97,558.324,575.107,As a result we must continue to explore consumer protections to fight misleading and harmful practices at Cpcs . In this unprecedented moment we must continue to work together to unlock all financial and structural barriers that the patients are facing.,9,,
68,0.97,575.107,583.816,We know that in no uncertain terms that the majority of Washington and across the country against overturning Roe V wade.,9,,
69,0.97,583.816,593.225,"We know it is the leading issue for voters heading into November, in Washington state specifically.",9,,
70,0.97,593.225,596.696,We must take our responsibility as a St. George state and sanctuary city seriously.,9,,
71,0.97,596.696,597.964,We cannot take it for granted.,9,,
72,0.97,597.964,605.504,It takes all of us and our continued dedication to make sure that we protect people going forward.,9,,

87,0.97,717.116,724.89,It's been almost a month since the Supreme Court overturned nearly 50 years of precedent and eliminated the fundamental right to abortion.,11,,
88,0.97,724.89,741.24,"In that time my colleagues at planned Parenthood and abortion providers around the country have seen patients that are scared, unsure of where to turn and being stripped of their right to this fundamental basic health care.",11,,
89,0.97,741.24,754.487,"In Washington thanks to decades of relentless work to defend and expand our rights by leaders in Seattle like all of you Council members and across the state, abortion is still legal.",11,,
90,0.97,754.487,756.789,Abortion providers in Washington are and will remain open to all patient.,11,,
91,0.97,756.789,769.034,"We are not only here for Washington state patients But everyone no matter what state you live in or no matter who your lawmakers and governors are, providers in Washington are here to welcome you with open arms.",11,,
92,0.97,769.034,779.578,We already seeing patients from States across the country whose own people have abandoned them and left them without access to basic health care.,11,,
93,0.97,779.578,802.468,Because of the strong support and unwavering commitment of Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Herbold that we expect an influx of patients in the coming months and years and studies estimate that we should expect 385% growth in out-of-state patients traveling to Washington State to access abortion care.,11,,
94,0.97,802.468,810.075,That is why policies announce today are so critical to safeguarding and maintaining abortion access in Seattle.,11,,
95,0.97,810.075,826.458,"We want our providers and patients to be safe, protected and empowered to continue to provide abortion throughout the country, County and state no matter what.",11,,
96,0.97,826.458,826.926,Let's be clear.,11,,
97,0.97,826.926,832.998,We know that not all patients that want to travel to Washington to access abortion will be able to get here for care.,11,,
98,0.97,832.998,852.117,"State abortion bans sweeping the country and disproportionately filling black, Latino, indigenous and other people of color, people of low income, Lgbtq people, people with disabilities, and grants and more due to the country legacy of racism and systemic oppression.",11,,
99,0.97,852.117,859.825,"Abortion as health care, period . We are so grateful for the leaders here today.",11,,

134,0.97,1102.234,1110.776,The bill would also add a reference to the definition to the very sections of the Seattle municipal code that addresses discrimination.,19,,
135,0.97,1110.776,1123.288,"These additions would banned discrimination on the basis of an individual actual potential perceived or alleged pregnancy outcome, which would provide greater protection than just banning discrimination on the basis of the outcomes themselves.",19,,
136,0.97,1123.288,1139.638,"The bill put actual potential perceived or alleged pregnancy outcomes on par with other discrimination, prohibitions and efficacy like the basis of age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation and gender identity.",19,,

166,0.97,1318.417,1320.886,We have Ketil Freeman here to discuss the bill and welcome.,32,,
167,0.97,1320.886,1321.386,Thank you.,33,,
168,0.97,1321.386,1324.823,"Ketil Freeman, council central staff.",33,,
169,0.97,1324.823,1332.464,I will describe the mechanics of the bill and talk about the practical applications of adopting this state statute into the Seattle criminal code.,33,,
170,0.97,1332.464,1350.615,"Mechanically Council bill 120376 would incorporate or adopt by reference the misdemeanor codified in Chapter nine A-Dot 50, Seattle criminal code.",33,,
171,0.97,1350.615,1364.896,It establishes misdemeanor that establishes willful or reckless for violence for the crime interfering with access to health care facilities and disruption of the operation of health care facilities.,33,,
172,0.97,1364.896,1374.272,"The actions are the elements of the crime and called obstruction, trespass, harassing phone calls, violence or those sorts of things.",33,,
173,0.97,1374.272,1393.859,It would also incorporate the criminal penalties into the Seattle criminal code and the state statute rains from the fine up to $50 and a day in jail for first offense to $1000 and 30 days in jail for subsequent offenses.,33,,
174,0.97,1393.859,1405.504,What does this do as a practical matter? the Seattle police Department can currently in force the state missed a meter however the city has to rely on King County for prosecution.,33,,
175,0.97,1405.504,1422.587,Adding this section to the Seattle criminal code will authorize the city attorney to prosecute these crimes in the Seattle municipal court to effectively expand the forms where prosecutions can occur.,33,,
176,0.97,1422.587,1423.989,That is it.,33,,
177,0.97,1423.989,1425.824,Any questions?,33,,
178,0.97,1425.824,1430.228,It is pretty straightforward and thank you very much.,34,,
179,0.97,1430.228,1446.878,I think the importance of both of these bills is that we know that Seattle is fortunate to be able--Seattleites is fortunate to be able to access high-quality abortion care easily.,34,,
180,0.97,1446.878,1463.962,"But we also know that a lot of people will be coming in from other States and surrounding areas where access to care is not allowed . So we need to be ready and the previous bill, for example, as folks are coming from out of state, people will be staying at hotels.",34,,
181,0.97,1463.962,1477.242,People will be eating meals and we want to make sure that people are not targeted in anyway while they are here in this state and particularly year in Seattle while they are seeking that care.,34,,
182,0.97,1477.242,1499.397,"Similarly we want to make sure that if somebody, if there is Harassment as before trying to access care, if there's any sort of interference, putting people in jeopardy because they are trying to seek this care, it's important that we be able to prosecute that kind of behavior.",34,,
183,0.97,1499.397,1501.132,So that is what we are trying to do here.,34,,
184,0.97,1501.132,1508.64,I will ask colleagues if there are any questions.,34,,
185,0.97,1508.64,1510.308,Councilmember Strauss.,34,,
186,0.97,1510.308,1517.082,You can let Councilmember Sawant go ahead of me.,35,,
187,0.97,1517.082,1518.717,"Councilmember Sawant, lease go ahead.",36,,
188,0.97,1518.717,1526.057,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",37,,
189,0.97,1526.057,1529.995,I have a question but I want to make sure of my understanding of the bill that it is correct.,37,,
190,0.97,1529.995,1545.477,I was just listening to what Ketil Freeman was explaining and we talk about the Rcw or the state law that is relevant here.,37,,
191,0.97,1545.477,1552.984,"So that I know the laws and penalties regarding interferes with health care providers, already exists on the state level and my understanding is that this bill does not change any of that.",37,,
192,0.97,1552.984,1573.672,Right now the Seattle police are already under the authority of the state law to investigate and arrest people who for example might attack and abortion clinic . right now because there are state laws those arrests would be Stent to trial at King County court rather than Seattle municipal court.,37,,
193,0.97,1573.672,1579.177,The only effect of the bill is to allow the city to choose to prosecute someone in Seattle municipal court rather than King County municipal court.,37,,
194,0.97,1579.177,1610.809,But the King County court would still be an option . is that all accurate question mark because my question is as I try to understand--[Indiscernible] is there a difference or if this mainly about making a statement or redirecting the statement that Seattle cares about and supports the laws that exist in this state for protection of abortion clinics?,37,,
195,0.97,1610.809,1611.343,Thank you.,37,,
196,0.97,1611.343,1617.782,You are correct that the bill does not sort of take away King County ability to prosecute crimes.,38,,
197,0.97,1617.782,1619.551,It just allows the city attorney to do that.,38,,
198,0.97,1619.551,1633.331,"For example, if King County asking attorney had a backlog of felony cases something like that, that they would have to Prioritize, the city attorney could choose to prosecute those crimes in municipal court.",38,,
199,0.97,1633.331,1644.109,There may be some advantages to pursuing actions for civil remedies in Superior Court.,38,,
200,0.97,1644.109,1654.119,That is King County court as opposed to municipal court because the state statute reserves certain types of relief like injunctive relief to the Superior Court to provide that.,38,,
201,0.97,1654.119,1665.563,So if someone was seeking several remedies they still may want to pursue an action in Superior Court as opposed to municipal court.,38,,
202,0.97,1665.563,1669.134,That is the distinction.,38,,
203,0.97,1669.134,1674.072,"But Councilmember, does that answer your question?",39,,
204,0.97,1674.072,1679.611,"Yeah, I think so.",40,,
205,0.97,1679.611,1680.612,For now anyway.,40,,
206,0.97,1680.612,1681.279,Thank you.,40,,
207,0.97,1681.279,1683.915,I appreciate it.,40,,
208,0.97,1683.915,1688.153,"Councilmember Strauss, did you have a question?",41,,
209,0.97,1688.153,1692.424,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",42,,
210,0.97,1692.424,1706.638,I was having some difficulty before the last vote and had a question about both bills but I know that beyond these two bills we need to be funding abortion access in this upcoming budget.,42,,
211,0.97,1706.638,1717.348,"When I met with the Mayor whose budget team just this week, it was at the top of the list of shared priorities that we want to make sure we are funding abortion access.",42,,
212,0.97,1717.348,1721.586,I know my team looked into these bills.,42,,
213,0.97,1721.586,1732.831,I know that you and Councilmember Herbold ran the lead Witch-Hunt respect and promote.,42,,
214,0.97,1732.831,1735.8,"If you're interested in cosponsors I would like to cosponsor but if not, totally great.",42,,
215,0.97,1735.8,1741.172,I look forward to voting yes on both bills and now on the second bill.,42,,
216,0.97,1741.172,1741.74,"Thank you, chair.",42,,
217,0.97,1741.74,1744.676,"We would certainly welcome your Cosponsorship, Councilmember Strauss.",43,,
218,0.97,1744.676,1747.445,Thank you very much and we will be happy to do that.,43,,
219,0.97,1747.445,1752.183,"Councilmember Nelson, did you have a question? I did not see you out of my peripheral vision.",43,,
220,0.97,1752.183,1756.054,Not anymore.,44,,
221,0.97,1756.054,1756.488,Okay.,45,,
222,0.97,1756.488,1758.757,I don't see any of the questions.,45,,
223,0.97,1758.757,1774.973,I do think it is important just to state that we are already hearing about people in other States and the impact of this Dobbs ruling on folks in Texas that are being denied prescribed birth control.,45,,
224,0.97,1774.973,1779.811,People are being denied Lupus medication because it might lead to Miscarriages.,45,,
225,0.97,1779.811,1793.291,"Women are getting sterilized rather than risk pregnancy, particularly by the Rapist.",45,,
226,0.97,1793.291,1801.733,Those are concerns some people having which is another whole set of jarring issues to think about.,45,,
227,0.97,1801.733,1805.837,The impact of these decisions are real and being felt already in a dramatic and in many cases life-threatening way.,45,,
228,0.97,1805.837,1816.047,It's really important that we as a city and state that is providing access to care that we make sure that people are coming here are protected.,45,,
229,0.97,1816.047,1818.983,People that are providing the care are protected as well.,45,,
230,0.97,1818.983,1835.133,"So if there are no other questions or comments, and I don't see any, I will move that Council bill 120376, move for passage and can I get a second.",45,,
231,0.97,1835.133,1835.934,Second,46,,
