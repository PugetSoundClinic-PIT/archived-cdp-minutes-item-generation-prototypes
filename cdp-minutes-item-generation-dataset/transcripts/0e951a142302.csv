49,0.97,37061.724,37070.266,My name is Martin Lawson and I am a longtime resident of Seattle and in my youth I struggled personally with homelessness and addiction.,9,,
50,0.97,37070.266,37070.867,For 10 years.,9,,
51,0.97,37070.867,37072.035,In the 90S.,9,,
52,0.97,37072.035,37081.644,Like I said I personally know how addiction and homelessness can affect every part of your being.,9,,
53,0.97,37081.644,37101.531,I currently support the just care effort as a member of the Wbc safety team and in this role I'm able to support Nonpolice safety engagement models as individuals are given housing and support in their effort to get out of homelessness and addiction.,9,,
54,0.97,37101.531,37113.309,The just care program reduces Incarceration rates and issues of Covid exposure and other health risks that threaten this population and the larger Seattle population indirectly.,9,,
55,0.97,37113.309,37135.665,I strongly encourage the Council to continue funding for the just care program because it is doing a wonderful work and it's almost impossible to quantify the positive things that this program is doing behind the scenes.,9,,
56,0.97,37135.665,37149.846,"We are able to have in my role at the Wcc safety team, having conversations with the clients of this program daily and them just sharing how helpful this program has been to them on a personal note.",9,,
57,0.97,37149.846,37155.118,So like I said I strongly encourage the continued support of the program.,9,,
58,0.97,37155.118,37160.022,Thank you.,9,,
59,0.97,37160.022,37161.491,Thank you for your time today.,10,,

61,0.97,37165.495,37199.462,"Hello, my name is Dominic and I am one of the Cofounders of Wbc communities safety--I don't want to repeat what everyone has already heard but I want to say that Wbc has been providing safety in the community of the hotels that are participants, we have built Reltionships with the participants and built relationships with the hotel staff and built relationships with the care staff and that is what community safety is all about.",11,,
62,0.97,37199.462,37212.441,Community safety is about relationships and being Proactive and preventive and not Reactive is when you build a relationship you are able to step in and use those relationships to leverage those connections we've already made.,11,,
63,0.97,37212.441,37213.042,To De-Escalate things.,11,,
64,0.97,37213.042,37223.419,"That is what has been happening and that's why the police have not had to be called, they haven't had to come get anyone since we've been doing this work and that's one thing.",11,,
65,0.97,37223.419,37244.14,Another thing is I feel like it's kind of Crazy that we have to have this conversation to try to convince people to put resources behind housing people in dealing with people's mental health and having case management to deal with drug addiction or any kind of thing that people are dealing with and literally if this money does not come down the Pike they will be back on the street and we will have another bigger problem.,11,,
66,0.97,37244.14,37254.116,"We're always talking about what community safety looks like, just cares has provided a model for us to emulate and grow.",11,,
67,0.97,37254.116,37263.226,"This conversation should not be around whether we put resources behind it, it should be around how do we get more resources and grow this program to be bigger and expanded because it has answers in it and we're always looking for answers.",11,,
68,0.97,37263.226,37272.969,We have the bucket of mental health and the bucket of housing in the bucket of drug addiction and millions of dollars get Ported to the different buckets but here you have an answer where all the buckets are answered at one time.,11,,
69,0.97,37272.969,37283.145,It's time for us to think bigger and think outside the box and start putting resources into the answers that already exist in the community and quit trying to come up with new stuff.,11,,
70,0.97,37283.145,37298.194,It is something that works and we need to deal with it and support it and the puts the finances behind it and put more people behind it and one more thing I want to say is everybody that is relying on Wdc staff are people of color.,11,,
71,0.97,37298.194,37307.703,We have 13 employees employed through Wdc and we want to allow that to 50 or 100 employees and have a bunch of hotels going and get everybody off the streets.,11,,
72,0.97,37307.703,37308.571,Thank you.,11,,
73,0.97,37308.571,37311.941,Thank you very much for your time this morning and for those examples.,12,,

75,0.97,37320.549,37321.117,Good morning and.,12,,
76,0.97,37321.117,37323.552,Good morning and thank you for allowing me to speak today.,13,,
77,0.97,37323.552,37328.224,I'm speaking on behalf of the just care program as we are in support of it.,13,,
78,0.97,37328.224,37346.309,"I do represent a small hotel in downtown Seattle that many of you know has faced tremendous challenges during the pandemic, just to give you a Snapshot this past year our hotel closed for 65 days last spring and our restaurant has been closed three times.",13,,
79,0.97,37346.309,37355.451,During this pandemic we have laid off or furloughed over 50 employees who were not only our colleagues but our close friends.,13,,
80,0.97,37355.451,37362.958,As a leader in hospitality for over 17 years I have never experienced anything like what the pandemic has done to our field.,13,,
81,0.97,37362.958,37380.943,When PDAS first approached us with this opportunity there was hesitancy on our part because it is truly a pivot from the day-to-day hospitality businesses we are used to doing but as we learned more about the program and the support that PDA and a CRS would provide we knew we had to answer the calling to support the crisis happening in our city.,13,,
82,0.97,37380.943,37390.986,We have now been in partnership for five months and we would absolutely make the same decision again if presented with it.,13,,
83,0.97,37390.986,37397.293,There have certainly been challenges but with the support we've been able to work through them.,13,,
84,0.97,37397.293,37407.636,Also had the opportunity to bring back 16 additional staff members to help support Day-To- day operations and as of today we now have 25 staff members working at the hotel.,13,,
85,0.97,37407.636,37412.908,"We provide housing, security, meals, maintenance and housekeeping and so much more.",13,,
86,0.97,37412.908,37416.612,What is been amazing to watch is the bond that our team has created with some participants on property.,13,,
87,0.97,37416.612,37429.792,These type of interactions have been happening frequently with all of our team members and it gives us the motivation to continue the work.,13,,
88,0.97,37429.792,37434.463,I cannot Express how valuable the partnership with PDA and a CRS is to our successor at the hotel and with our business.,13,,
89,0.97,37434.463,37437.666,It is a true partnership and one we hope to continue in 2021.,13,,
90,0.97,37437.666,37438.734,Thank you.,13,,
91,0.97,37438.734,37440.569,Thank you very much and good morning Lisa.,14,,
92,0.97,37440.569,37442.505,You are up next.,14,,
93,0.97,37442.505,37465.528,"Hi, I'm Lisa Nitze with Nitze as day in and we are a real estate developer and have properties in many parts of the city including Pioneer square and have gotten to know the just care team and program well.",15,,
94,0.97,37465.528,37468.798,Because of this work in Pioneer square and pid.,15,,
95,0.97,37468.798,37474.27,Just care has made a demonstrable difference in Pioneer square.,15,,
96,0.97,37474.27,37495.825,"I'm part of a group that we started called the second Avenue extension safety and security group of property owners and businesses that are operating in Pioneer square due to Covid, the amount of safety and security concerns and issues just escalated enormously.",15,,
97,0.97,37495.825,37511.04,As well as the tragic situation of more and more people that were living on sheltered in tents on the sidewalk.,15,,
98,0.97,37511.04,37517.813,"Our group is made up of businesses and property owners, government, both city and county and service organizations.",15,,
99,0.97,37517.813,37550.045,We've been working together with just care on how together we can be not only getting people that are living on sheltered into temporary lodging and getting the services they need but also realizing the other elements necessary for a thriving community which is small businesses being able to operate because there is access to them on the sidewalks or in public spaces.,15,,
100,0.97,37550.045,37562.424,"And an increase in perception and a feeling of safety and security amongst residents, employers, employees and visitors.",15,,
101,0.97,37562.424,37572.401,Just care is very impressive in that it has a social impact framework and is looking to social impact Metrics and intended outcomes.,15,,
102,0.97,37572.401,37582.978,It is reporting out on those things so the money is very well spent and the Metrics show that the results are there.,15,,
103,0.97,37582.978,37586.548,So I'm just asking that you please consider continuing.,15,,
104,0.97,37586.548,37597.793,Thank you Lisa and I think we got most of it.,16,,
105,0.97,37597.793,37599.461,If there was anything else please Email us.,16,,
106,0.97,37599.461,37602.665,The last person on this list is Kirby and then we have about five more folks.,16,,
107,0.97,37602.665,37603.265,Kirby good morning.,16,,
108,0.97,37603.265,37611.774,"Good morning Council members, my name is Kirby and I'm an employee with the reach leap program and I work closely with just cares by screening and helping the homeless community move into adequate shelter.",17,,
109,0.97,37611.774,37623.319,Just care participants are extremely vulnerable with about 70% being--and due to shoulders closing the community is living in unsafe conditions.,17,,
110,0.97,37623.319,37631.694,Additionally it means that they are at a heightened risk to contract and spread Covid-19.,17,,
111,0.97,37631.694,37633.329,But what other options do they have?,17,,
112,0.97,37633.329,37646.709,They are unable to go to shelters and the just cares program has placed a majority of them in hotels and I visited them in the hotels and can attest to the stability and basic needs this is providing as a first step.,17,,
113,0.97,37646.709,37660.956,Many have joined our intensive case management and once they are provided an opportunity to save a life they are on in--this program ends March 15 and we need a continuation plan to help the community recover.,17,,
114,0.97,37660.956,37669.198,"Above all the homeless community needs to know that Seattle is not turning their backs on them, sheltering is a basic need and especially essential during a world health crisis.",17,,
115,0.97,37669.198,37670.099,Thank you for your time.,17,,
116,0.97,37670.099,37673.535,Thank you very much.,18,,

124,0.97,37728.59,37738.734,"And because conjugate shelter was not available if they didn't have this option they would be forced back on the streets of Chinatown, Id in Pioneer square.",19,,
125,0.97,37738.734,37752.748,"The impact for retailers is really profound, prior to Covid we had 32 retailers operating in Pioneer square in our buildings and most of them were small businesses.",19,,
126,0.97,37752.748,37754.983,Right now over half of them are not going to reopen.,19,,
127,0.97,37754.983,37763.926,The ones that are still there are struggling to survive and having a healthy and safe sidewalk atmosphere is their number one concern.,19,,
128,0.97,37763.926,37776.071,So we really hope that finance and housing APPROVES a bridge funding for just cares and keeps Federal reimbursement.,19,,

135,0.97,37815.511,37820.415,The good news is Seattle ranks number one for how we compassionately care for Un- housed and keep to focus the situation in dignified ways.,21,,
136,0.97,37820.415,37824.686,More numbers and cost and I talk about this issue because people say just care has an expensive price tag.,21,,

268,0.97,39142.036,39165.893,Are there ideas or strategies you are interested in using when we open up more access to healthy food sites in the wake of the crisis and hardship that the pandemic has created and any thoughts that you think the community advisory board should potentially be looking at as you embark on this recovery effort that should never go back to the way things were.,48,,
269,0.97,39165.893,39168.195,Absolutely.,49,,
270,0.97,39168.195,39184.645,I think this is a very complex answer but I think it definitely starts with listening to communities and trying to create opportunities to hear folks that have been marginalized or maybe don't have as much access to show up in spaces like this.,49,,
271,0.97,39184.645,39209.503,That is something that I would like to consider myself as a bridge to bringing in those voices and through my work with my organization doing food distribution we've learned that all of these systems that are happening in response to Covid are new and people are trying their best but sometimes the access is still not there or it's not always meeting everyone's need.,49,,
272,0.97,39209.503,39218.746,So to get a really complex and Nuanced picture of what the community needs actually are is really important.,49,,
273,0.97,39218.746,39231.358,Because we've seen that there is greater need for like delivering food to people's homes and things like that and that people can always just show up somewhere at a specific time for all sorts of factors.,49,,
274,0.97,39231.358,39248.375,"Another thing that I think is important is really Prioritizing the needs and engaging the voices of the small business owners, Poc business owners, a lot of the things that we've seen with food is like a lot of these big companies and corporations are benefiting from the pandemic right now.",49,,
275,0.97,39249.376,39251.078,Because people are limited in where they can shop.,49,,
276,0.97,39251.078,39269.33,And I remember back when there was a lot of shortages it kind of pushed people to go to some of these larger stores so through my organization we've been trying to put money back into communities hands to purchase food or deliver food that comes from some of these smaller grocers.,49,,
277,0.97,39269.33,39271.532,And some of these mom and Pops.,49,,
278,0.97,39271.532,39281.742,Helping to keep putting money back into these communities so that we are not always having to go outside of our communities to find the resources.,49,,
279,0.97,39281.742,39303.33,But I think that any process should begin with a solid community assessment and some deep listening and finding ways to transcend some of the barriers that we know exist in terms of people having access to spaces where they can be heard and be heard by people in positions of power.,49,,
280,0.97,39303.33,39323.584,"That's a fantastic answer and I know we will very much look forward to learning from you, especially as we consider these various issues and the opportunity for potential for Federal dollars which we will be talking about soon.",50,,
281,0.97,39323.584,39341.869,"My understanding is that Phoenix has initiated a partnership with folks on the ground for getting more local farms, restaurants and food entrepreneurs dollars right now to invest directly into the food apartheid areas and that might be an interesting thing for us to quickly follow up on as well.",50,,
282,0.97,39341.869,39353.847,"I look forward to having you in your service there and also I really appreciate Minera's interest in serving, please pass along our appreciation for Minera's interest in serving on the board as well.",50,,
283,0.97,39353.847,39369.096,And really we appreciate the Unapologetically embracing her roots as a refugee and immigrant especially since those are most impacted by the crisis that Covid is only making worse in many of our communities.,50,,
284,0.97,39369.096,39380.908,"So with that, I see no more questions or comments, I move the committee recommends passage of the appointment of Jimmy Marsh and Minera Mohammed to the sweetened beverage tax community advisory board.",50,,
285,0.97,39380.908,39381.875,Do I have a second?,50,,
286,0.97,39381.875,39387.715,"Thank you very much Councilmember Lisa Herbold, any additional comments or questions?",50,,
287,0.97,39387.715,39392.619,Hearing none let me actually take a vote.,50,,
288,0.97,39392.619,39394.922,"Sorry about that, Mdm.",50,,
289,0.97,39394.922,39405.632,Clerk will you please call the role on the passage of the appointments to the sweetened beverage tax community advisory board?,50,,
290,0.97,39405.632,39421.315,[roll call] five in favor none opposed.,51,,
291,0.97,39421.315,39446.473,"Excellent, now it's an Animus, the appointments are confirmed and we will make sure the committee recommendation is sent to the Seattle city council meeting for a final vote and you don't have to be there in person but we will make sure to talk about your great answers here today and all counsel colleagues will have the materials that were submitted to this Committee.",52,,
292,0.97,39446.473,39452.146,Thank you very much and thank you Alyssa for your time today and please pass on our appreciation for the extensive and amazing work over the past few years.,52,,
293,0.97,39452.146,39452.546,Thank you.,52,,
294,0.97,39452.546,39456.417,Thank you.,53,,
295,0.97,39456.417,39462.122,"Thank you colleagues and we are going to move on to item number four, our last appointment of the day.",54,,
296,0.97,39462.122,39462.322,Mdm.,54,,
297,0.97,39462.322,39464.625,Clerk will you read item number four into record?,54,,

300,0.97,39474.101,39487.08,"Wonderful and welcome deputy Mayor six killer, thank you for being with us, we are happy to have you here.",56,,
301,0.97,39487.08,39498.859,Acting director Steve mark Casey thank you for your time this morning and I will turn it over to deputy Mayor for a short introduction but I wanted to say how much I appreciated having the opportunity to meet with you.,56,,
302,0.97,39498.859,39532.192,"I know you will be making the rounds and meeting with other Council members that you may not have met yet and I've got to say it was great from here--to hear from--, we really appreciate all of the comments that you've put in the extensive question and answer document that we sent around, our counsel questionnaire is very informative to our discussions and especially your answers around your childhood experience and how that work has reflected back in your career and your commitment to social justice workers rights.",56,,
303,0.97,39532.192,39548.742,"And I really appreciate that you have led the efforts to see labor standards in your answer sheet, you've led with an effort to see labor standards implementation in a post Covid world and I think that's really important and we will talk about that.",56,,
304,0.97,39548.742,39568.428,"And I want to note that while your questions were greatly appreciated we have not yet seen the question and answer packet yet, I believe the longest one came from the office of economic development so we're not first but we appreciate your extensive answers because it was probably time-consuming and very appreciated.",56,,
305,0.97,39568.428,39571.999,To deputy Mayor six killer I will turn it over to you.,56,,
306,0.97,39571.999,39603.463,"Thank you, I'm delighted to be able to zoom in today and introduce Steve mark Casey, our Mayor director was so excited to nominate the city's next director of the office of labor standards and he will be joining us for over 20 years of public service experience which we think will be such a tremendous value add and help him in his transition to the city.",57,,
307,0.97,39603.463,39613.44,Director Marquise he moved to Seattle recently from St. Paul so I feel like he brought the snow with him this weekend but we're going to try to see past that.,57,,
308,0.97,39613.44,39615.275,As he moves into his new role.,57,,
309,0.97,39615.275,39629.923,Most recently Steve was serving as a public service director for the Minnesota state bar Association leading efforts to make pro Bono services to organizations that serve the public.,57,,
310,0.97,39629.923,39651.211,"He also served as director of the St. Paul school board and in that role developed and sustained strong relationships with the community, and ploys, leadership and labor representatives and of course elected officials all in service to bring high-quality education and ensuring a respectable and equitable work environment afforded strict staff and students.",57,,
311,0.97,39651.211,39670.931,As an attorney Steve has represented both employees and employers in employment discrimination and labor civil Litigations and as an attorney Commissioner on the Minneapolis civil rights Commission has first-hand experience developing policy and civil rights and complaints.,57,,
312,0.97,39670.931,39683.744,His legal background and extensive leadership in coalition building and expertise makes him an excellent choice to build a long our city's work to create economic opportunity for workers in business alignment.,57,,
313,0.97,39683.744,39693.086,As you all know we put our applicants through a pretty robust selection process.,57,,
314,0.97,39693.086,39715.075,"Steve went through that with flying colors, that includes engagement from other cabinet members as well as our staff, our change team and representatives from all the advisory boards, the New York small business advisory Council and of course our local labor partners.",57,,
315,0.97,39715.075,39733.994,Steve is committed to building relationships within the business and labor community and working with city departments and deck sternal partners and counsel to continue to make Seattle a place for working people to grow and thrive and we are very excited he is willing to join us here and we welcome him to the Pacific Northwest and appreciate very much the Council scheduling time today to allow them to be before the committee.,57,,
316,0.97,39733.994,39736.029,Thank you.,57,,
317,0.97,39736.029,39746.707,Thank you deputy Mayor and I will also echo my appreciation for the Mayor's office and the robust process she went through for engaging Stakeholders in the interview process.,58,,
318,0.97,39746.707,39792.385,"We know that you have been pulling together folks to do a lot of recruitment of candidates so I think it speaks volumes to the nomination in front of us that Mr. Marquez was selected and I also want to thank the folks who provided feedback on the questionnaire that I noted, my chief of staff who helped coordinate various questions and responses, she requested feedback from various boards and commissions as well as labor and business partners and had the opportunity to have a few conversations with folks from Minneapolis and Minnesota as well so I appreciate all the work that went into the background to get you here in front of us.",58,,
319,0.97,39792.385,39793.854,So please go ahead without further Ado.,58,,
320,0.97,39793.854,39802.529,Thank you so much counselor Teresa Mosqueda and thank you Council members for the opportunity to meet you virtually.,59,,
321,0.97,39802.529,39805.398,I wish we could do this in person but it's great to be here.,59,,
322,0.97,39805.398,39809.069,Thank you deputy Mayor six killer for the introduction and for the opportunity to speak with you today.,59,,
323,0.97,39809.069,39825.218,I'm excited to be here with you and I'm excited to be in Seattle with our new home and to be able to talk about the office of labor standards and my interest in being the director of the office of labor standards.,59,,
324,0.97,39825.218,39838.899,"I'm excited to have the support of the Mayor and to have gone to this process with you and I'm happy to answer questions from Council members about my background, my interest in any of the issues you see raised in the questionnaire.",59,,
325,0.97,39838.899,39842.569,Okay thank you very much and we do have quite a bit of background material for us.,60,,
326,0.97,39842.569,39845.071,I think I'll start with questionnaire just to get us started.,60,,
327,0.97,39845.071,39870.33,"So I mentioned that we did our own extensive outreach to various community partners and no surprise, you know our office, we had the opportunity to connect with various labor unions in Minnesota to see what they thought about the potential appointment and to ask questions of them and they actually turned it back around and offered to ask a question of you that I thought was very informative.",60,,
328,0.97,39870.33,39894.154,"They asked us to consider, they wanted us to pass along how do you see the role changing from your previous job and how do you see new challenges in front of us at this point in the post Covid world given that you will have this position, what are some of the more immediate things you would like to do?",60,,
329,0.97,39894.154,39894.754,Thank you.,61,,
330,0.97,39894.754,39903.096,And I'm glad to hear that you were able to reach out to my comrades in the twin cities in Minnesota.,61,,
331,0.97,39903.096,39916.309,I had good relationships with folks there for many years and I've been pleased to have many of the organizations support as an elected official and Endorsements from labor councils and union members in St. Paul.,61,,
332,0.97,39916.309,39918.979,This is a different role than what I have been doing in St.,61,,
333,0.97,39918.979,39932.158,"Paul, as a school board member I am one of the seven official representatives of the District and so my responsibility is to represent the District and the community in labor negotiations but also in policymaking.",61,,
334,0.97,39932.158,39948.174,So I've had a Governance role and that includes oversight of policies and negotiations with bargaining units and that's a very different role that I have here.,61,,
335,0.97,39948.174,39975.835,"Although I see how I've been able to, in St. Paul, incorporate some of the principles around labor standards and to my Workfare one of the things I talked about in the questionnaire response was our decision prior to St. Paul having a minimum wage was to decide to make sure that all of our employees and marketing units were able to make and get to a $15 an hour minimum and did that as part of district policy and part of our labor negotiations and we were able to do that with some of the lowest paid members of our staff community.",61,,
336,0.97,39975.835,39979.973,And I'm excited we were able to do that as part of our district board policy and as a collective.,61,,
337,0.97,39979.973,39989.215,In this role as labor standards director we know that the community of workers is struggling.,61,,
338,0.97,39989.215,40018.078,"To be able to make a living, to be able to work in the community and be able to secure the opportunity that we have good benefits and good wages, to organize collectively, work now is done in a lot of different ways than they were before and in other words people are at home and in cars and in different places and spaces that is a challenge for organizing.",61,,
339,0.97,40018.078,40050.844,"That really means that it's important for a regulator in the office of labor standards to really step in and help with the assistance of counsel and the Mayor's office, baseline protections for our workers, unlike being a board member where I can say as one of seven we are going to do this as a collective, as a board and an entity for all of our workers for St. Paul public schools.",61,,
340,0.97,40050.844,40071.297,"This office is dealing with thousands of workers throughout the city and it's also dealing with employers who are coming from many different circumstances, many of them struggling at this time with economic downturn as a result of Covid and they are trying very hard to maintain their businesses and particularly with--and Women-Owned businesses, that do not have the kinds of infrastructure as a school district with the general counsel's office and people available.",61,,
341,0.97,40071.297,40083.777,We need to think about how we can educate community members were in business,61,,
342,0.97,40098.358,40100.493,Excellent.,62,,
343,0.97,40100.493,40101.528,I am not seeing hands.,62,,
344,0.97,40101.528,40106.566,Are there any other questions?,62,,
345,0.97,40106.566,40114.908,Do tell me if I am pronouncing your last name correctly.,62,,
346,0.97,40114.908,40115.742,"Thank you, Yeah.",63,,
347,0.97,40115.742,40116.376,It is Italian.,63,,
348,0.97,40116.376,40121.815,"Excellent, thank you.",64,,
349,0.97,40121.815,40124.084,"Please, Councilmember.",64,,
350,0.97,40124.084,40154.814,"Thank you so much, I appreciate your willingness to serve the city of Seattle and this important Department, and I think it is critical to the ability of Seattle to live its values and stand up for coworkers and work to be a leader among other jurisdictions throughout the country, and lift the standards for everyone, one day at a time.",65,,
351,0.97,40154.814,40156.149,That is what we need to do.,65,,
352,0.97,40156.149,40223.55,"In that area, I have been very concerned, about as we have worked really hard in conjunction with workers, with the traditional workforce, to raise the standards, we have seen a proliferation of jobs that do not benefit from those standards and there has been a strategic and intentional growth of good workers, and contract workers, generally speaking, so as we pass laws like secure scheduling and increase the minimum wage, you see this increase in unregulated workforce and I think it is incumbent on us as a city to address that.",65,,
353,0.97,40223.55,40289.182,"Madam chair has done great work with some segments of that workforce, whether or not it is domestic workers or transportation, drivers, and I appreciate her leadership and doing that work segment by segment, and I am also really interested in doing some Overarching work for folks who are potentially not in a traditional Employer/Employee relationship, so some basic requirements be regulated across different work sectors, and labor standards, advisory councils, they have made some really good recommendations and I am really interested in them.",65,,
354,0.97,40289.182,40302.195,They are focused on transparency and disclosure climates during the contracting process or the hiring process regardless of what you want to call it.,65,,
355,0.97,40302.195,40303.429,It really is a hiring process.,65,,
356,0.97,40303.429,40331.124,I want to know if you have some thoughts about what minimum it should be disclosed when somebody is entering into an agreement with somebody who is essentially an employer who fulfills a workplace obligation.,65,,
357,0.97,40331.124,40332.825,"Thank you so much, Councilmember, for the question.",66,,
358,0.97,40332.825,40340.199,"This is incredibly timely, particularly as we look at recovery and the experiences we have had over the last year and it goes back to changes with the labor market over a long time.",66,,
359,0.97,40340.199,40353.346,"They are working, and the fact there are not former, employee relationships.",66,,
360,0.97,40353.346,40378.171,"You do have a significant and growing section of the labor market and the labor section of the market, by the way, is made up of community members and arrivals, and folks looking to make a living and these are arrangements that are being created and the law treats them as if they were equally positioned gardeners who can come up with a contract for the purposes of the services as a worker.",66,,
361,0.97,40378.171,40385.712,That is not necessarily the circumstance when it comes to to that.,66,,
362,0.97,40385.712,40407.033,Corporations have a lot more power and authority and ability to set standards and put them into the contract and arrangement and avoid responsibility for the kind of protections we want to see workers have under state and local law.,66,,
363,0.97,40407.033,40419.412,"I think we need to think about, if we will rely on the fact and acknowledge, because we cannot stop it, that a significant part of the population is coming into relationships constructed by contracts, that the contract need to apply.",66,,
364,0.97,40419.412,40435.728,"We need to think how clear that information is made available to the employee, for the worker also, how the worker who is going to be getting those services and selling their services to other contracting entities, and what they should know.",66,,
365,0.97,40435.728,40462.054,They should know about the rate of pay and how it is calculated and about scheduling and about expenses and the way those expenses are going to be born and having the ability to understand clearly what is going to be in and not in that contract and what they must be expected to provide.,66,,
366,0.97,40462.054,40488.614,"They should know about scheduling and the opportunity to change or alter the contract and they should know these things in ways that are done so that the perspective--they can understand, so the language, the workers understand the language and that this is different compared to other kind of employer opportunities, so they can evaluate that and they can understand if they are going to be on the hook for changes.",66,,
367,0.97,40488.614,40542.268,"There are the principles that the advisory condition cannot that are helpful, and I think it is important we do not necessarily hide behind the contracting relationship as a way to avoid making sure that the standards that we hope to see as a collective, that we, that our community wants to see for our work are are somehow avoided because that legally does not sit with the traditional parameters of employment and you look at the standards of contracts and clarity and Intentionality and making sure we make that possible for contracting arrangements.",66,,
368,0.97,40542.268,40543.936,Thank you very much for that answer.,67,,
369,0.97,40543.936,40545.104,Any questions or additional questions?,67,,
370,0.97,40545.104,40563.322,Thank you so much for your response and becoming Familiarized with the recommendations of the labor standard advisory Council and I look forward to working with you on advancing this policy.,68,,
371,0.97,40565.091,40566.492,"Thank you so much, you too.",69,,
372,0.97,40566.492,40567.026,"Okay, wonderful.",70,,
373,0.97,40567.026,40568.261,I am not seeing a hand.,70,,
374,0.97,40568.261,40570.129,I do have a follow-up question that is related.,70,,
375,0.97,40570.129,40608.034,"You talked about the topic that they have referred to in questions five and seven, and I think, you know, one of the things we are interested in is making sure the approach to businesses and small businesses, including workplaces that are hard to reach workers, I say that because, you know, cars are workplaces for many of these folks who are working in gig work or independent contractor work.",70,,
376,0.97,40608.034,40625.952,"We want to make sure we are doing outreach to employers and employees or hire entities and individuals doing the work, but one of the questions in response to question seven, your approach would be with businesses and workers, as opposed to either or.",70,,
377,0.97,40625.952,40627.019,I think this is good.,70,,
378,0.97,40627.019,40642.101,"We have been looking at ways to find when winds and wondering if you believe this is an advocacy Department with small businesses because Unfortunately, there are times where we cannot necessarily do both.",70,,
379,0.97,40642.101,40664.357,"We do need to pick a Lane to make sure there is really adherence to the standards and I bring this up because we have some early situations where they are relying heavily on education, education, education, and there are larger changes that are needed.",70,,
380,0.97,40664.357,40668.961,I appreciate the work they have done and recognizing the need to be in the enforcement agency.,70,,
381,0.97,40668.961,40669.629,How do you balance?,70,,
382,0.97,40669.629,40682.508,There is no question in my mind that the whole process is to benefit standards for workers.,71,,
383,0.97,40682.508,40687.546,We start with the presumption that we are here to ensure standards and make sure we are enforcing those standards on behalf of the workers.,71,,
384,0.97,40687.546,40693.786,"These are the fundamental purpose for the ordinances that you and your colleagues have passed and the purpose of our work, as a baseline.",71,,
385,0.97,40693.786,40737.263,"I completely see there is obviously a need to do the education work, to help employers, to make sure they understand the obligations that they have, that they are language appropriate and culturally appropriate but the ultimate responsibility for enforcing adherence is to have a solid office and it needs to be clear and effective and seen as an honest broker and it needs to start the presumption that we are here to make sure that workers are protected, and education efforts that we have are ensuring that is happening because we cannot have our staff everywhere around the city.",71,,
386,0.97,40737.263,40759.251,"We also need to be reliance on given relationships, that will get things done . We need to make sure they work closely with community based organizations and the work of the community and labor unions.",71,,
387,0.97,40759.251,40775.801,"Members with domestic worker standards boards who provide information, I think those are the key relationships that we should use it to get information out to the worker community but also use that feedback information to the staff.",71,,
388,0.97,40775.801,40782.174,That also puts us to have an opportunity to do the best outside of just the soul complaint based method.,71,,
389,0.97,40782.174,40801.26,"We are looking at places where we can see that there are not as many formal complaints but we know that compliance is not really what we wanted to be and that allows our office to move more investment tools, to be able to do that.",71,,
390,0.97,40801.26,40815.107,"Those are remedies, those are techniques that we can use to advance this work that is part of the mission of this office.",71,,
391,0.97,40815.107,40819.779,That is not incompatible with employers.,71,,
392,0.97,40819.779,40822.281,We have a desire to see employers do good work with their employees.,71,,
393,0.97,40822.281,40827.887,That is the fundamental thing we want to see.,71,,
394,0.97,40827.887,40829.488,We do not need to get involved.,71,,
395,0.97,40829.488,40832.124,"If we happen to do, we know that does not happen all the time.",71,,
396,0.97,40832.124,40833.159,That is why we exist.,71,,
397,0.97,40833.159,40837.229,I dial love hearing that.,72,,
398,0.97,40837.229,40858.15,That is an efficient way for the Department and for variant sectors to have that enforcement and focus that we need.,72,,
399,0.97,40859.018,40860.586,"Councilmember, do you have something you want to add?",72,,
400,0.97,40860.586,40865.658,"Your line of questioning, Madam chair, reminded me of another question I wanted to ask related to a recent report on secure scheduling.",73,,
401,0.97,40865.658,40873.966,I do not know director if you have had a chance to see it yet but it is a Second-Year report out of the city auditor's office.,73,,
402,0.97,40873.966,40883.843,"It shows some increased gains over the first year report and it still does have a pretty, I think, high rate of noncompliance, it being experienced by workers.",73,,
403,0.97,40883.843,40932.458,"We still see about 50% of those employees surveyed experiencing last-minute shift changes without pay, and workers experiencing different ships without pay and superior thing canceled--I wonder if you had a chance to review this yet, if you have thoughts about how we can use strategic investigation principles, including direct investigation to see we have more gains for workers in this area.",73,,
404,0.97,40932.458,40935.327,Thank you.,74,,
405,0.97,40935.327,40946.071,I did see it across this Email a couple days ago.,74,,
406,0.97,40946.071,40948.14,I have not had chance to fully Digest the findings.,74,,
407,0.97,40948.14,40965.991,"I have set up next week with staff to do that more fully but I think on the question, on a higher level, my thoughts, it is important to think about this, that the ordinances are doing secure scheduling and it is one of the ones we're looking at closely.",74,,
408,0.97,40965.991,40988.58,This is culture change within the community and within the businesses that are impacted by this.,74,,
409,0.97,40988.58,40991.417,Úwhat we are trying to do is shift the norm and that takes time.,74,,
410,0.97,40991.417,40997.489,I think it is important that public education shifts the norms and Educates people around the environment and educate the workers about what they have the right to ask for.,74,,
411,0.97,40997.489,41009.868,"People that are doing the kinds of work that and that being high noncompliance industries, they do not know that they actually do not have to worry about last-minute changes.",74,,
412,0.97,41009.868,41021.847,"If we are going to change the norms, we need to be able to get that information out clearly to the community of workers and employers and we also need to get that feedback, to be able to say this is something that we are not seeing and we have issues.",74,,
413,0.97,41021.847,41044.136,"I think the audit is really helpful and it will help us think about where are some specific kinds of industries where we need to think more about test driving to see the beginning, what we need, and if not, how can we take the opportunity to invest in education and to solicit information.",74,,
414,0.97,41044.136,41056.148,Are there employers who repeatedly use noncompliance and therefore we are hearing maybe not necessarily from the workers for a variety of reasons.,74,,
415,0.97,41056.148,41065.557,Maybe they do not know and do not want to let us know.,74,,
416,0.97,41065.557,41082.408,"We also should look at the kinds of industries and the places where that happens more frequently than others, so we can use audit findings like this to help guide the way that our enforcement team can use its efforts to be able to open up investigations and see what is going on and how it is going to be handled.",74,,
417,0.97,41082.408,41085.811,I think it is hard to think about 100% compliance.,74,,
418,0.97,41085.811,41101.693,I think we have 100% in a lot of things but I think what we ought to see over the course of time is a higher rate of compliance and less concerned that people are getting bumped off of their schedules and needing to seek redress.,74,,
419,0.97,41101.693,41112.204,"Excellent, great question.",75,,
420,0.97,41112.337,41114.873,I am not seeing any additional questions or comments at this time.,76,,
421,0.97,41114.873,41124.082,"I know that you do have other meetings to have with Councilmembers and perhaps we can go back into this Committee, pending any final confirmation.",76,,
422,0.97,41124.082,41136.228,"We can hear more about different questions, as we think about how the world evolves in this world.",76,,
423,0.97,41136.228,41137.83,Do you have anything you want to add?,76,,
424,0.97,41137.83,41139.465,Thank you for being with us as well.,76,,
425,0.97,41139.465,41147.105,Is there anything else you would like to add before we consider your nomination?,76,,
426,0.97,41147.105,41153.078,"Sure, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.",77,,
427,0.97,41153.078,41156.014,I want to thank the Mayor's office for a selected me for this opportunity.,77,,
428,0.97,41156.014,41166.091,I am excited to start . I'm learning a lot about the office and there is terrific staff that has been working hard.,77,,
429,0.97,41166.091,41180.539,I want to help them do their best work and want to be part of the work to really strengthen protections for our low workers and to work with you and others in our community to make this a place that works for everyone.,77,,
430,0.97,41180.539,41181.54,Thank you for this opportunity.,77,,
431,0.97,41181.54,41182.741,Thank you very much.,78,,
432,0.97,41182.741,41209.535,"We appreciate the more robust engagement process that the Council had requested I think that is why there was a little bit, making sure you can start your positions soon and I know that I am impressed and I appreciate your answers and there will be another conversation as the world continues to respond to the changes Dynamics across the economy.",78,,
433,0.97,41209.535,41216.308,Thank you for your time and for being with us and for your answers to the questionnaire.,78,,
434,0.97,41216.308,41226.818,We will make sure to pass that along to all of our colleagues and if they have any additional questions we will make sure to let you know.,78,,
435,0.97,41226.818,41237.196,At this time I would like to move the committee to recommend passage to the appointment of this person as the director.,78,,
436,0.97,41237.196,41237.963,I second it.,79,,
437,0.97,41237.963,41245.07,"Wonderful, are there any additional comments?",80,,
438,0.97,41245.07,41245.904,I am hearing nine.,80,,
439,0.97,41245.904,41252.778,We will call the roll.,80,,
440,0.97,41252.778,41254.446,Councilmember?,81,,
441,0.97,41254.446,41258.884,Councilmember and jealous?,82,,

445,0.97,41270.529,41286.178,"The motion carries and the recommendation will be set to March 1 for a final vote and director, you do not--you are welcome if you want to come to make a few comments before the subcommittee.",83,,
446,0.97,41286.178,41286.912,We will welcome you back.,83,,
447,0.97,41286.912,41289.514,We will double check the process.,83,,
448,0.97,41289.514,41291.016,I know that it can be strange.,83,,
449,0.97,41291.016,41316.608,"We usually do require a department director to make an appearance, so we will put you on the agenda and we will suspend the rules and allow you to address members of the public and the full counsel for a few minutes in follow-up to a vote of her confirmation.",84,,
450,0.97,41316.608,41320.245,Thank you so much.,85,,

454,0.97,41336.495,41338.63,"We will see you soon, thank you.",88,,
455,0.97,41338.63,41373.465,"Colleagues and interim director, I wanted to see if you might be able to switch to the agenda today to have item number six and five next, would you have some guests with us from Washington, D.C. there is a short Timeline to have them with us until 11:30, so if it is Okay, we will go ahead and go to item number six.",89,,
456,0.97,41373.465,41377.002,Item number five was the budget selection for briefing and discussion.,89,,
457,0.97,41377.002,41378.704,"There is no vote, if I am correct.",89,,
458,0.97,41378.704,41385.11,We will have an opportunity to have that discussion on March 2 and I look forward to getting amendments if they are any.,89,,
459,0.97,41385.11,41388.714,I can get to that item before we adjourn and we can do that but I seeing nods.,89,,
460,0.97,41388.714,41391.917,"Thank you very much, director.",89,,
461,0.97,41391.917,41393.618,We will go to item number six first.,89,,
462,0.97,41393.618,41394.986,"Madam clerk, can you please read it?",89,,
463,0.97,41394.986,41410.802,Federal funding for Covid relief for briefing and discussion.,90,,
464,0.97,41410.802,41411.636,Thank you very much.,91,,
465,0.97,41411.636,41412.904,I'm excited for this conversation.,91,,
466,0.97,41412.904,41415.841,I know this is a point in time assessment of what you could potentially expect.,91,,
467,0.97,41415.841,41425.884,"We will have folks introduce themselves briefly but I believe we have director Ben noble here, and Sierra Brown and Wesley with us.",91,,
468,0.97,41425.884,41441.133,"Thank you very much for being with us, our Federal lobbyist and partners in D.C., who represent the city in the halls of Congress and virtually now.",91,,
469,0.97,41441.133,41443.335,Is there anyone else I missed in terms of today's meeting?,91,,
470,0.97,41443.335,41443.769,"Okay, wonderful.",91,,
471,0.97,41443.769,41452.077,"So I'm going to turn it over, I believe, to director noble.",91,,
472,0.97,41452.077,41453.078,"You are going first, wonderful.",91,,
473,0.97,41453.078,41454.913,I am seeing nods from folks on the line.,91,,
474,0.97,41454.913,41462.454,"We appreciate your willingness pool pull together this Committee, knowing what is in play.",91,,
475,0.97,41462.454,41498.19,"We know there are multiple funding streams that many have asked questions about with rental assistance and homeless assistance, and there is food assistance funds we are hearing about, and there is the ongoing cares act funding and FEMA dollars, that look to be shaping up, which we will have a robust presentation from today, and we know there is continuing Covid relief dollars as well.",91,,
476,0.97,41498.19,41505.73,There is lots of conversations about potential dollars but this is an opportunity to understand if there is additional money coming and if there is carryover dollars and what we could expect in terms of a Timeline.,91,,
477,0.97,41505.73,41507.332,"Thank you very much, again, for being here.",91,,
478,0.97,41507.332,41512.07,"Thank you, you have said much of what I was going to say.",92,,
479,0.97,41512.07,41516.474,The goal is to give you an update on the goings on in D.C ..,92,,
480,0.97,41516.474,41538.63,Sierra will have good presentations to give you on the proposed $1.9 trillion relief package that is being debated in Congress now and promises to provide significant new resources to the city.,92,,
481,0.97,41538.63,41556.581,"I will follow on to talk more about the resources that we have available to us now, including the resources that are allocated to us from last year, and what remains in our process and also around reimbursements.",92,,
482,0.97,41556.581,41566.424,"So, please introduce yourself.",92,,
483,0.97,41566.424,41568.26,"Once you put up the Powerpoint, peoples' faces will disappear.",92,,
484,0.97,41568.26,41572.33,I will share my screen and put up the Powerpoint that provides the narrative.,92,,
485,0.97,41572.33,41573.365,This is Sierra Brown.,93,,
486,0.97,41573.365,41581.573,I am the director for the office of government relations in the city and go ahead and introduce yourself.,93,,
487,0.97,41581.573,41589.981,"Thank you, I am Wesley.",94,,
488,0.97,41589.981,41595.687,"I am part of the labor government group and I have the honor of representing the center of Seattle and Washington, D.C.--night to see you.",94,,
489,0.97,41595.687,41605.363,"With that, I will grab the screen here and begin the presentation.",95,,
490,0.97,41605.363,41606.264,Let's see if this works.,95,,
491,0.97,41606.264,41611.336,And you will see that now?,95,,
492,0.97,41611.336,41614.406,"Yes, we can, thank you.",96,,
493,0.97,41614.406,41614.773,Great.,97,,
494,0.97,41614.773,41621.913,Give me one second.,97,,
495,0.97,41621.913,41649.708,"So, again, just quickly on the outline, we will start with Leslie Palmer and some resources, including the Coronavirus relief fund with significant Federal dollars that we were awarded last year and the reimbursement process and some ongoing funding decisions that we have made on the executive side to sustain some of our activities and then talk about the next steps.",97,,
496,0.97,41649.708,41658.883,I will turn this over to Leslie.,97,,
497,0.97,41658.883,41662.32,"If I missed anything, give me a verbal clue and I will change the slide.",97,,
498,0.97,41662.32,41663.154,Thank you.,98,,
499,0.97,41663.154,41703.728,"We talked about the fact that President Joe Biden had proposed a nine--a plan and as you know, from updates before, before Congress, they have decided to use a process known as budget reset conciliation to get this plan through, given the political realities of the simple majority they have in the house and basically the tie in the Senate.",98,,
500,0.97,41703.728,41708.633,"So, on February 5, the house and Senate started the budget reconciliation process and took the first step and they passed the Buzzard resolution.",98,,
501,0.97,41708.633,41713.705,"Next slide, please.",98,,
502,0.97,41713.705,41743.735,"And so, the budget resolution provided instructions to the 12 different House committees to draft and report legislation, largely sticking with the $1.9 trillion plan that President Joe Biden has proposed, and again, the process is this really arcane process but it essentially allows Congress to bypass the 60 vote threshold that is needed to get anything passed in the Senate.",98,,
503,0.97,41743.735,41764.089,"So, it has certain parameters that are very narrow that I will not bore you with the details of, but when the bill gets to the Senate, there is something called a rule that allows senators to block part of the reconciliation bill that are deemed extraneous to the measure and that is my favorite term.",98,,
504,0.97,41764.089,41779.704,"It is called giving the bill a birdbath, and so certain pieces that I will talk about in a moment, that the House has passed may fall out when this bill gets to the Senate.",98,,
505,0.97,41779.704,41780.138,"Next slide, please.",98,,
506,0.97,41780.138,41786.077,"As I mentioned, the house and Senate adopted a budget resolution kicking off this process last week.",98,,
507,0.97,41786.077,41835.293,"House committees--F0 they were all rejected, and so next week on Monday, the House budget committee is going to meet, and they will reassemble the bill, put all the pieces together and on February 26, the house is slated to put forth the package and then move through the Senate, and they decided to move with a lot of speed that they are going to bypass the committee process.",98,,
508,0.97,41835.293,41842.734,So any changes to the bill will come through amendments on the House floor.,98,,
509,0.97,41842.734,41854.813,That is then to go back to the house for a final vote.,98,,
510,0.97,41854.946,41860.819,They are targeting March 14th because that is when the pandemic benefits will expire.,98,,
511,0.97,41860.819,41861.286,"Next slide, please.",98,,
512,0.97,41861.286,41875.466,"To outline the process as I said before the tentative date for final process in the house is February 26, and then, looking to pass the bill before March 14.",98,,
513,0.97,41875.466,41875.8,Next slide.,98,,
514,0.97,41875.8,41877.468,So highlights from the bill.,98,,
515,0.97,41877.468,41881.339,"You know, this is really--this bill is really tremendous.",98,,
516,0.97,41881.339,41898.556,"In December, as I think we had highlighted before, you know, $900 billion package, while very important and providing some very important benefits for individuals was not particularly helpful to the city and city programs.",98,,
517,0.97,41898.556,41920.411,"It was funding, of course, for housing, some additional nutrition assistance but really, you know, no direct funding for local, and you know, limited amounts in reimbursement, et cetera.",98,,
518,0.97,41920.411,41923.281,This bill is really the bill we had hoped for.,98,,
519,0.97,41923.281,41935.36,It's an important bill and I will put a huge caveat with this legislation.,98,,
520,0.97,41935.36,41945.77,This is very likely the last Coronavirus relief bill.,98,,
521,0.97,41945.77,41950.174,They may have one other bite at the apple this year they will use for infrastructure.,98,,
522,0.97,41950.174,41953.811,But you will not see a bill like this again.,98,,
523,0.97,41953.811,41965.99,"So these dollars are sacred dollars that are coming to the city and really, really important to think about how we spend them if we will see them again.",98,,
524,0.97,41965.99,41966.457,"Next slide, please.",98,,
525,0.97,41966.457,41979.871,"From my perspective, one of the most important and valuable pieces of this legislation is it includes $350 billion for direct funding for state and local deposits.",98,,
526,0.97,41979.871,41995.42,The funding going for cities and counties $130 billion which is divided evenly and using a modern formula.,98,,
527,0.97,41995.42,42003.194,"And those are not the dollars but the formula, and the house is trying to make the dollars flexible.",98,,
528,0.97,42003.194,42011.402,"They can be used to replace lost revenue death back to January 27, 2020.",98,,
529,0.97,42011.402,42015.707,"Again, S this money that will come directly to the city.",98,,
530,0.97,42015.707,42016.04,Next slide.,98,,
531,0.97,42016.04,42022.68,And this is also a wide range of means they are covering through the bill.,98,,
532,0.97,42022.68,42036.828,"$25 billion in emergency rental assistance, $10 billion for Homeowner assistance, and additional funding for Ppe.",98,,
533,0.97,42036.828,42040.398,Next slide.,98,,
534,0.97,42040.398,42043.134,And then the $1400 for qualifying individuals.,98,,
535,0.97,42043.134,42051.442,They are working to increase the Federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025.,98,,
536,0.97,42051.442,42061.853,"This is likely a provision that will come out in the quote, Unquote bird bath that the Senate has given the bill.",98,,
537,0.97,42061.853,42076.467,You have had two moderate Democrats say they are uncomfortable with including this in the Coronavirus relief bill and there were questions raised if this fits in the reconciliation process.,98,,
538,0.97,42076.467,42081.939,So this may come out.,98,,
539,0.97,42081.939,42096.521,"It extends the temporary fully refundable benefits through August 29, 2021 and increases the benefits from the $300 to $400.",98,,
540,0.97,42096.521,42096.988,"Next slide, please.",98,,
541,0.97,42096.988,42140.097,"And then again, $46 bill I ion for testing and $14 billion for vaccines and an additional $500 million to help those during the pandemic for drink water and $130 billion for K through 12 schools to help with reopening, $40 billion for higher education, and $5 billion for food assistance.",98,,
542,0.97,42140.097,42144.035,Next slide.,98,,
543,0.97,42144.035,42154.812,It stays with a 15 percent increase in STAT benefit through September 30th.,98,,
544,0.97,42154.812,42159.517,The next slide.,98,,
545,0.97,42159.517,42171.329,There is $7.25 billion for the pay check protection program and additional funding for arts organizations shuttered on the save our stages program.,98,,
546,0.97,42171.329,42176.467,"There is a new program created, $25 billion program specifically for restaurant grants.",98,,
547,0.97,42176.467,42185.71,And that's going to be distributed through the FDA.,98,,
548,0.97,42185.71,42190.248,"An additional $30 billion for transit, $8 billion for airports.",98,,
549,0.97,42190.248,42210.234,There is also $3 billion that's going to be economic development administration of which $450 million is specifically reserved for communities for travel tourism and outdoor recreation and $50 billion for FEMA.,98,,
550,0.97,42210.234,42216.541,"And, then, you know, a number of programs to support veterans as well.",98,,
551,0.97,42216.541,42216.841,Next slide.,98,,
552,0.97,42216.841,42217.074,Great?,98,,
553,0.97,42217.074,42227.485,I know time is limited so I thought it might be important to have Councilmembers have questions in this portion of the presentation before moving on.,99,,
554,0.97,42227.485,42229.353,And I will defer to you.,99,,
555,0.97,42229.353,42230.221,Absolutely.,100,,
556,0.97,42230.221,42238.663,Anything else to add to this portion?,100,,
557,0.97,42238.663,42238.863,Okay.,100,,
558,0.97,42238.863,42239.163,Wonderful.,100,,
559,0.97,42239.163,42262.32,"We are incredibly lucky to have you in the halls of Congress, and I know you are doing everything you can to work remotely during these times and we are very Luckily in the city of Seattle for your time and presentation.",100,,
560,0.97,42262.32,42268.659,"Colleagues, questions for this presentation?",100,,
561,0.97,42268.659,42269.727,Council President Gonzalez?,100,,
562,0.97,42269.727,42280.571,"Leslie, a couple of slides back, 14, I think, Yeah, this one, 14.",101,,
563,0.97,42280.571,42301.759,"So on the $25 billion in restaurant grants and the small business administration program, can you talk more about that and in particular, I'm interested in getting an understanding of how those dollars getting directly into cities?",101,,
564,0.97,42301.759,42321.579,"What is the Connectivity there, and what is the grant dollar--what are they designed to do in terms of support for restaurants and which restaurants are the funds being focused and targeted towards?",101,,
565,0.97,42321.579,42328.986,At the risk of being a little--I will actually have a quick summary of the program.,102,,
566,0.97,42328.986,42333.157,"Let me if it's okay, I will leave that and answer a different question.",102,,
567,0.97,42333.157,42341.899,It's $25 billion for a new program at the FDA offering assistance to restaurants and other food and drinking establishments.,102,,
568,0.97,42341.899,42347.405,"$5 billion is set aside for businesses with less than $500,000 in 2019 revenue.",102,,
569,0.97,42347.405,42361.319,And then grants are available for up to $10 million per entity with a limitation of $5 million per visible location and entities are limited to 20 locations.,102,,
570,0.97,42361.319,42369.193,They are trying to avoid the Cheesecake factories of the world getting grants from this.,102,,
571,0.97,42369.193,42388.512,"It talks about how you would populate revenue and it mentions that during the first 21 days, applications from restaurants opened and operated and controlled by women, veterans or socially and economically disadvantaged individuals will have priority.",102,,
572,0.97,42388.512,42402.393,"So, again, trying to avoid the largest chains, the largest and most established restaurants and grants may be used for a wide variety of ventures.",102,,
573,0.97,42402.393,42416.407,"And in terms of Connectivity, like how do the fund it's eye understand it's through the FDA so I assume it's through the regional FDA?",103,,
574,0.97,42416.407,42421.245,Do people need to go through an application process?,103,,
575,0.97,42421.245,42442.299,"There will be--my understanding, and again, some of this will get flushed out, and this may end up being a lot like the P Pp program, so a similar process for applying.",104,,
576,0.97,42442.299,42442.566,Okay.,105,,
577,0.97,42442.566,42481.105,"That--the Ppp program didn't inspire a lot of confidence particularly amongst our restaurant groups, and I heard concerns from the chef owners from restaurants that they are so dependent on large financial institutions, and they were, a lot of folks that I talked to, you know, expressed concerns about this being outright denied and having to scramble to find an institution that would be willing to be an administrator.",105,,
578,0.97,42481.105,42491.816,I would like to get a better idea of how we are going to avoid some of those advantages and barriers if they are thinking about how to avoid those challenges and barriers.,105,,
579,0.97,42491.816,42503.027,"And if not, there is an Úopportunity for the city to think about how to do gap funding or support through the office of economic development.",105,,
580,0.97,42503.027,42513.037,"And other, just sort of make sure people aren't going to Miss out on the opportunity to access the necessary funds for folks in the industry.",105,,
581,0.97,42513.037,42520.444,Let us get more information on that on the Distribuion mechanism and circle back on that.,106,,
582,0.97,42520.444,42520.978,Happy to do that.,106,,
583,0.97,42520.978,42524.782,"Thank you very much, and thank you, Council President.",107,,
584,0.97,42524.782,42535.292,"And I included in the chat, president Gonzalez, the actual section right now and as Leslie said, we will have more on the package and amendment.",108,,
585,0.97,42535.292,42542.299,"For the viewing public, 6003 in the revitalization Fund.",109,,
586,0.97,42542.299,42551.408,So it's all available publically and people can look that up as well.,109,,
587,0.97,42551.408,42552.676,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",109,,
588,0.97,42552.676,42553.043,Thank you.,110,,
589,0.97,42553.043,42560.317,"And I have a question on the slide--I'm sorry, I don't have the slide number.",110,,
590,0.97,42560.317,42605.095,"But the slide that describes the allocation for funds in the state as compared to local governments and what the formula is, and specifically t looks like there is a bucket of funding of upwards of $45 billion for municipalities and populations of at least 50,000 and apparently, there's a--they're using a modified Cbdc formula to determine of that $46 billion for those cities of populations of 50,000 or more, and they will prime that formula.",110,,
591,0.97,42605.095,42617.441,"Do we have--if you covered this, I apologize--do you have a Guesstimate of the cities for our size?",110,,
592,0.97,42617.441,42623.047,Do we have a Guesstimate of what Seattle might be seeing?,110,,
593,0.97,42623.047,42623.48,Yeah.,111,,
594,0.97,42623.48,42634.692,"So the House oversight committee will have the estimated allocations, and this is really preliminary and subject to change depending on what happens in the Senate.",111,,
595,0.97,42634.692,42639.63,They will be estimated to receive $221 million.,111,,
596,0.97,42639.63,42646.47,Thank you.,112,,
597,0.97,42646.47,42648.205,And one other question.,112,,
598,0.97,42648.205,42669.827,"The funding for testing and vaccine, I'm wondering, does the $26 billion for testing and $14 billion for vaccines include any sign to allow the city to cover our own cost of administering tests and vaccines?",112,,
599,0.97,42669.827,42678.602,Or would Reimbursing ourselves for the costs come out of the efforts or --,112,,
600,0.97,42678.602,42688.345,"At this point, the dollars are largely distributed in the same way and coming throughout state and County.",113,,
601,0.97,42688.345,42689.079,Thank you.,114,,
602,0.97,42689.079,42692.216,Thank you very much.,115,,
603,0.97,42692.216,42703.427,"I know that there is ongoing conversations with folks at King County who have really stepped up and provided key services, you know.",115,,
604,0.97,42703.427,42717.307,"And folks probably, you know, just Harken back to the cares presentation and King County stepped up to foot the bill and last time I checked Pi near square was in Seattle.",115,,
605,0.97,42717.307,42739.663,"So there is tremendous work that our County partners have been helping out in in Seattle and I wonder if you have an idea of how much they might be receiving and we will have comments on the package and the hoped-for process before we wrap up, but Leslie, any sense for the region who the amount might be for the King County partners as well?",115,,
606,0.97,42739.663,42749.807,I don't have that right at my fingertips.,116,,
607,0.97,42749.807,42751.942,But that is easy to track down and circle back on.,116,,
608,0.97,42751.942,42759.95,"Thank you very much, and we appreciate the vaccines and testing and, you know, the way that we have all had to step up.",117,,
609,0.97,42759.95,42763.22,I think that will be part of the conversation going forward.,117,,
610,0.97,42763.22,42778.669,Is there a chance we might be able to ask you about the issue of the city and others across the nation stepping up to provide relief?,117,,
611,0.97,42778.669,42785.576,"It would have been irresponsible not to have acted, and there are many areas we stepped up to provide assistance.",117,,
612,0.97,42785.576,42804.128,"Are any of the funds that are made available, is there a way for us to recognize with additional Federal support that perhaps allows the city, if it's Covid relief directed, to use the Federal funds so that the city resources can go for things that they were originally intended for?",117,,
613,0.97,42804.128,42811.869,One of the uses that specified near the House are broad uses specified for that direct local funding.,118,,
614,0.97,42811.869,42816.24,One of them is to replace lost revenue.,118,,
615,0.97,42816.24,42827.384,"And the deadline, the Timeline for that is they gave it to January 27, 2020.",118,,
616,0.97,42827.384,42827.618,Wow.,119,,
617,0.97,42827.618,42828.185,That's great.,119,,
618,0.97,42828.185,42838.862,I'll just throw out the other piece on that is they have not specified an ending to what the funds need to be extended by.,120,,
619,0.97,42838.862,42850.474,That is something that you can easily see the Senate changing to put Guardrails on the funding.,120,,
620,0.97,42850.474,42862.386,"Similarly, the date for lost revenue could change but lost revenue is one of the explicit uses they identified for legislation.",120,,
621,0.97,42862.386,42869.526,Glad to hear that.,121,,
622,0.97,42869.526,42869.826,Thank you.,121,,
623,0.97,42869.826,42891.782,And do we know what resources are available by funds to support any long-term--like do we have to have any dollar amounts already specified to then be able and use this?,121,,
624,0.97,42891.782,42893.15,No matching requirements?,121,,
625,0.97,42893.15,42893.383,No.,122,,
626,0.97,42893.383,42894.785,Other questions?,123,,
627,0.97,42894.785,42909.266,"I do have some more questions, director noble, and they might be more appropriate for your half of the present as they relate to the city resources and what we expect to do with some of the expenses we have already put forward.",123,,
628,0.97,42909.266,42918.609,"So just that I'm clear, Leslie, you mentioned initial funding for rental assistance and homeless assistance and food assistance.",123,,
629,0.97,42918.609,42933.857,And we see much of that similar concept in the $1.Nine trillion package.,123,,
630,0.97,42933.857,42938.328,And there is no restrictions on layering on the new package to get out the door?,123,,
631,0.97,42938.328,42938.562,No.,124,,
632,0.97,42938.562,42956.78,We'll take a closer look once the legislation has been finalized that you must expend so much funds.,124,,
633,0.97,42956.78,42961.818,The only place for it to be an issue in the FEMA dollars.,125,,
634,0.97,42961.818,42986.91,"They would general anticipate us using other Federal resource ahead of that, and that's our approach today but, again, that would be the very least, and there are significant resources headed our way, and details on the Timeline would be the middle of next month.",125,,
635,0.97,42986.91,42995.018,Can I ask about that in light of the changes we have seen?,126,,
636,0.97,42995.018,42998.822,"Do we have the greater understanding, and is that the conversation you are hearing?",126,,
637,0.97,42998.822,43008.999,Yeah I think you have seen the Biden administration making an effort to make people to more useful.,127,,
638,0.97,43008.999,43018.308,"Let me say I work with a number of cities across the country, and everyone is experiencing significant challenges with FEMA.",127,,
639,0.97,43018.308,43034.725,"It's just an incredibly confusing cumbersome process that quite frankly, I don't think anybody ever contemplated the use for a national disaster of this scale.",127,,
640,0.97,43034.725,43038.929,"It's an incredibly confusing process, and it's just really difficult.",127,,
641,0.97,43038.929,43053.51,I do know that even some communities that have Forgone going after FEMA because they are so frustrated with the process and it's obviously a heavy drain on local resources.,127,,
642,0.97,43053.51,43063.787,But I want to underscore it's a challenging process and the administration is doing what they can to make the process easier.,127,,
643,0.97,43063.787,43067.591,But even that is slow going.,127,,
644,0.97,43067.591,43067.958,Okay.,128,,
645,0.97,43067.958,43068.258,Wonderful.,128,,
646,0.97,43068.258,43075.031,I think this is pretty specific to an executive order and I hope it's okay if I tag this person on.,128,,
647,0.97,43075.031,43087.511,The Biden administration last week I think signed the executive order that increased FEMA assistance making them 100 percent Reimbursable.,128,,
648,0.97,43087.511,43114.471,"And I'm wondering if we know if any of the funding--when the funding might be able to Disburse or has itself already begun, any updates that we might pass on for folks working, for example in the community kitchen program and working to make sure that our small businesses and local food banks have access to that food assistance.",128,,
649,0.97,43114.471,43124.08,"So I don't have updates about that, but I know Ben will be talking about the FEMA reimbursement project.",129,,
650,0.97,43124.08,43132.389,We will have more information to follow but the executive order was very high level.,130,,
651,0.97,43132.389,43147.838,"So we are awaiting, if you will, bureaucratic function from FEMA but one thing that was clarified clearly was the paperwork filed under the 75 percent reimbursement rate.",130,,
652,0.97,43147.838,43152.042,It would be automatically converted.,130,,
653,0.97,43152.042,43158.315,"We don't have to resubmit, and there is no additional paperwork required.",130,,
654,0.97,43158.315,43169.526,Once they start to cut checks they will cut it at a 100 percent rate and for folks they already cut checks they will provide an additional resource.,130,,
655,0.97,43169.526,43174.564,The timing is one of the challenges in dealing with FEMA.,130,,
656,0.97,43174.564,43178.301,But I will speak in a few moments.,130,,
657,0.97,43178.301,43188.144,The cash flow is not a significant one and he we would like to be repaid sooner than later but it's not critical for us.,130,,
658,0.97,43188.144,43188.912,That's great.,131,,
659,0.97,43188.912,43202.526,I am glad you won't have to apply again for the 100 percent and a strong indication this administration is moving quickly and with common sense as we try and respond to this crisis.,131,,
660,0.97,43202.526,43202.726,Okay.,131,,
661,0.97,43202.726,43207.797,So more to come on the expectation for the Timeline for FEMA reimbursement.,131,,
662,0.97,43207.797,43215.572,I do want to make like a general statement and ask if this is accurate.,131,,
663,0.97,43215.572,43232.355,"We had previously heard that the people to reimbursement was three years which is incredibly cumbersome, and we met with the King County director, and they received funding for the first half of 2020.",131,,
664,0.97,43232.355,43235.692,So six months compared to three years.,131,,
665,0.97,43235.692,43251.174,Any other indication that the FEMA reimbursement will be coming in as quickly as six months or hints how quickly jurisdictions might expect reimburse!,131,,
666,0.97,43251.174,43257.047,I can say that I think that the three years was the worst case.,132,,
667,0.97,43257.047,43262.252,And I think it was build around more storms and earthquakes f you will.,132,,
668,0.97,43262.252,43271.228,"I did follow up with the county, and they were actually pleasantly surprised to receive the check when they did.",132,,
669,0.97,43271.228,43287.277,They didn't anticipate as payment as quickly as they had they had originally filed in August.,132,,
670,0.97,43287.277,43290.18,"Classically, you signed your Submittal when the work was completed.",132,,
671,0.97,43290.18,43293.283,That is not the scenario we are in.,132,,
672,0.97,43293.283,43311.501,"And we made some Submittals in October, and King County made some submissions in August and so if we were on six months, we would get a check in a couple of months.",132,,
673,0.97,43311.501,43312.269,They have expedited payments.,132,,
674,0.97,43312.269,43336.526,"And I think one thing to consider is both in terms of Coronavirus relief Fund, and the dollars last year that are made available in the new package, part of that is through the manage the cash flow with the FEMA reimbursement.",132,,
675,0.97,43336.526,43358.415,"Again, not an issue for us, but we did get a $130 million check from the Federal Government in March of last year, and depending on how this bill proceeds in DC, we might be getting a check in excess of that in the relative near future and it would quickly address cash flow needs.",132,,
676,0.97,43358.415,43362.652,"Again, the level of FEMA dollars is not an issue for us in particular anyway.",132,,
677,0.97,43362.652,43368.558,There are other things that may cause us cash flow challenges that we can talk about.,132,,
678,0.97,43368.558,43381.471,"But that, I think, is part of why the dollars are so critical to the local government, to support the expenditure on an initial basis while they wait for reimbursement.",132,,
679,0.97,43381.471,43447.871,"I was just going to, in terms of awareness to and a hopefulness here, part of this is, you know, what I mentioned before, FEMA was never participated for a crisis of this magnitude, and also, we have the double Whammy of hard to believe in the Coronavirus in the administration and the FEMA administration has not confirmed yet but the hopefulness is that President Biden has nominated the New York City emergency management director there, and the city of Seattle through participation with the emergency manager's connection means I am hopeful that we will have someone in place to understand the needs.",133,,
680,0.97,43447.871,43450.173,All right.,134,,
681,0.97,43450.173,43450.473,Thank you.,134,,
682,0.97,43450.473,43454.21,"Councilmember Herbold, did you have another question?",134,,
683,0.97,43454.21,43462.652,Are we starting to go into this line of discussion around FEMA reimbursement?,135,,
684,0.97,43462.652,43467.09,Or--I think there are slides that give detail.,135,,
685,0.97,43467.09,43478.735,I am wondering whether I should ask questions now or wait until we get to the slides and the presentation.,135,,
686,0.97,43478.735,43483.072,"Leslie has four more minutes, so if you want to ask --",136,,
687,0.97,43483.072,43486.409,"No, no.",137,,
688,0.97,43486.409,43494.584,These are FEMA reimbursement question for the city in future slides.,137,,
689,0.97,43494.584,43494.851,Okay.,138,,
690,0.97,43494.851,43495.051,Okay.,138,,
691,0.97,43495.051,43499.389,"And Leslie, with that, I don't think there are any more questions for you.",138,,
692,0.97,43499.389,43501.491,I am not seeing additional hands.,138,,
693,0.97,43501.491,43510.8,Any last comments from your end or things to be looking for over the next few weeks here?,138,,
694,0.97,43510.8,43511.601,No.,139,,
695,0.97,43511.601,43527.417,But it's so delightful to be in front of you versus three months ago and I hope we are on the right path and we will pivot to infrastructure and appropriations and hopefully I will be back with more good news.,139,,
696,0.97,43527.417,43528.051,Excellent.,140,,
697,0.97,43528.051,43543.5,"We appreciate good news after a few years of really tough times from the Federal administration, and it makes work life much better and thank you for the work there, and Sierra, will you know with us?",140,,
698,0.97,43543.5,43547.17,I will go dark but I'll be on.,141,,
699,0.97,43547.17,43549.973,"Leslie, thank you so much.",142,,
700,0.97,43549.973,43552.775,"And without further Ado, Ben, let's get to the slide.",142,,
701,0.97,43552.775,43553.109,I'm good.,143,,
702,0.97,43553.109,43565.855,I wanted to update more on the existing Federal funding and how to use it and then I'll talk about the next steps given the information that we just all heard from Leslie.,143,,
703,0.97,43565.855,43586.609,"See one big source of Federal funding that we got last year was the Coronavirus relief Fund, a total of $130 million there and just wanted to highlight where we stood and some of the opportunities now.",143,,
704,0.97,43586.609,43611.601,"And as indicated here we spent $103.4 million last year, so $28 million, and we will--when you approve the reallocation of the resources, it approved the language to have it carried forward in 2021 because the dollars were not fully spent, they would be available to access this year.",143,,
705,0.97,43611.601,43627.717,"So there is about $10 million left and a variety of purposes there across the board, food, shelter, some Ppe for city employees, and elements of that that are included in that territory.",143,,
706,0.97,43627.717,43631.02,There were purposely reserves of just over $17 million that were held.,143,,
707,0.97,43631.02,43643.299,"Again, that was part of the overall allocation process and they were held to cover the FEMA masks Max.",143,,
708,0.97,43643.299,43657.08,"25 percent local mask and holding in reserve, I'll highlight that in a moment, to cover the risk that FEMA might reject some share of what we submitted as Reimbursable costs.",143,,
709,0.97,43657.08,43662.885,"So two risks, one they redeem an expense not being categorically eligible.",143,,
710,0.97,43662.885,43674.13,"But we don't think that would happen because we have been careful to seek guidance, and documentation in the way that the resources were prepared.",143,,
711,0.97,43674.13,43681.037,The bottom line it's likely to hold some reserve for the risk but not a reserve as large as this.,143,,
712,0.97,43681.037,43695.551,"So a share of these resources are available, and the rules on the Crf changed late last year and had to be fully extended through 2020 and now through 2021.",143,,
713,0.97,43695.551,43706.996,So the resources will be available for us as we think about allocating both the existing resources and new resources that may be coming.,143,,
714,0.97,43706.996,43709.866,So that's the--that's the Crf resource.,143,,
715,0.97,43709.866,43732.021,And just so I'm clear on the last slide that's about $27 million that we can anticipate to be carried over into 2021 for the end of year.,144,,
716,0.97,43732.021,43749.806,"28 million for--approximately 11 allocated for specific relief efforts, and just over 17 million we had been holding in reserve given the changing rules on FEMA reimbursement.",145,,
717,0.97,43749.806,43755.478,"And if others are familiar with this, we want a little more clarity.",146,,
718,0.97,43755.478,43767.757,11 allocated specifically for relief and what categories?,146,,
719,0.97,43767.757,43774.197,I have no--Yeah.,147,,
720,0.97,43774.197,43777.166,Sorry.,147,,
721,0.97,43777.166,43777.8,One moment.,147,,
722,0.97,43777.8,43783.806,Trying to do too many things here at the at the same time.,147,,
723,0.97,43783.806,43784.107,One second.,147,,
724,0.97,43784.107,43796.352,I will try and share the right pieces again.,147,,
725,0.97,43796.352,43810.099,"So it's a variety of uses including food, some aspect of shelter, Ppe for city employees and a variety of things.",147,,
726,0.97,43810.099,43813.603,We had resources in different ways as part of the allocation plan.,147,,
727,0.97,43813.603,43815.271,I can get you the details.,147,,
728,0.97,43815.271,43819.809,I have them on a different screen.,147,,
729,0.97,43819.809,43824.947,"I am trying to share screens and my notes, and it's not possible.",147,,
730,0.97,43824.947,43839.428,"The $28 million, 17 in reserve and 11 dedicated right now, that's in addition to the 23 million for rental assistance.",148,,
731,0.97,43839.428,43839.796,Absolutely.,149,,
732,0.97,43839.796,43839.996,Yes.,149,,
733,0.97,43839.996,43840.229,Sorry.,149,,
734,0.97,43840.229,43841.764,Now I understand your question.,149,,
735,0.97,43841.764,43848.671,"It was a separate question, but thank you.",150,,
736,0.97,43848.671,43850.106,"Councilmember Lewis, go ahead.",150,,
737,0.97,43850.106,43851.44,Thank you.,151,,
738,0.97,43851.44,43856.179,I want to dig in on the 17 million total Reserve.,151,,
739,0.97,43856.179,43872.662,Just to clarify is it because we received some FEMA reimbursements that we will be comfortable going into that now or because we have new guidance getting more confidence.,151,,
740,0.97,43872.662,43873.796,Sorry.,152,,
741,0.97,43873.796,43874.163,Good question.,152,,
742,0.97,43874.163,43881.07,And primarily the shift from 75 percent to 100 percent reimbursement.,152,,
743,0.97,43881.07,43887.843,We didn't know what level of FEMA funding we would take advantage of.,152,,
744,0.97,43887.843,43901.757,"It's somewhat smaller than we anticipated because other governments who, the state and County, stepped up in areas where we thought we might be direct players.",152,,
745,0.97,43901.757,43915.538,"Under the FEMA rules, if you will, our authority to engage an allocated or delegated authority from the entities.",152,,
746,0.97,43915.538,43928.317,"If you have gone from 75 percent reimbursement to 100 percent reimbursement, and we don't need that 25 percent share but my only caveat is there is always a risk.",152,,
747,0.97,43928.317,43940.029,"So we may want to hold some Reserve and you will want the full $17 million, but the only risk is it's not a risk.",152,,
748,0.97,43940.029,43942.598,We don't have the local Max issue.,152,,
749,0.97,43942.598,43947.47,"The only issue is the risk of denial, and again, we are being careful about that.",152,,
750,0.97,43947.47,43950.539,I don't think that's a significant risk.,152,,
751,0.97,43950.539,43965.821,"Sure but to follow up on that, then, when we talk about potentially reducing the Reserve level, like how much black is that new information from the Federal Government putting into that?",153,,
752,0.97,43965.821,43972.995,"Like are we talking about drawing it down, you know, by 25 percent or by half or --",153,,
753,0.97,43972.995,43973.229,No.,154,,
754,0.97,43973.229,43974.664,I--again we haven't --,154,,
755,0.97,43974.664,43976.265,I am just trying to understand.,155,,
756,0.97,43976.265,43980.269,"To your question, I don't have a precise answer for you.",156,,
757,0.97,43980.269,43990.813,"But again, what we know is the shift from 75 to 100 percent is an executive order at a very high level without the details to follow up.",156,,
758,0.97,43990.813,43998.487,"It specifically references Retro active, and it will in theory apply to the expenditures last year.",156,,
759,0.97,43998.487,44005.628,So my guess is a reserve of $5 million or a little bit less would be sufficient.,156,,
760,0.97,44005.628,44022.912,"But we also need to think about looking forward as well and once we get additional clarity about the Federal resources in the new bill, we will have a better chance of what dollars will get spent from those resources based on what we draw from FEMA going forward.",156,,
761,0.97,44022.912,44024.447,You can tell it's a complicated story.,156,,
762,0.97,44024.447,44036.025,So you are saying we want want to hang on to at least five of the 17 million as a reserve to hedge against possibly not getting FEMA reimbursement?,157,,
763,0.97,44036.025,44038.294,That is my best guess.,158,,
764,0.97,44038.294,44043.632,"I hadn't thought through it before you asked the question but as I figure today, yes.",158,,
765,0.97,44043.632,44044.2,Okay.,159,,
766,0.97,44044.2,44044.6,Good to know.,159,,
767,0.97,44044.6,44046.535,Thank you so much.,159,,
768,0.97,44046.535,44061.917,"Thank you for the question Councilmember Lewis, and Councilmember Herbold is up next, and $5 million out of the FEMA Reimbursable dollars but there is 40 million in the general reserve of the city.",160,,
769,0.97,44061.917,44062.184,Correct?,160,,
770,0.97,44062.184,44063.386,Let me be clear.,161,,
771,0.97,44063.386,44070.726,This correct will not be out of the emergency reserve account or the stabilization account.,161,,
772,0.97,44070.726,44085.841,"These were dollars we chose not to spend and appropriate to specific Covid relief because we wanted to hold them, anticipating that we might need them again to address FEMA issues one way or the other.",161,,
773,0.97,44085.841,44091.48,And to hedge our bets for other needs we hadn't fully anticipated.,161,,
774,0.97,44091.48,44107.096,"So this is a reserve within the C rf spending, and it's entirely separate from the formal emergency Fund and revenue stabilization account, the rainy day Fund.",161,,
775,0.97,44107.096,44107.463,Thank you.,162,,
776,0.97,44107.463,44108.831,And Councilmember Herbold.,162,,
777,0.97,44108.831,44109.498,Thank you.,163,,
778,0.97,44109.498,44113.502,I appreciate the focus of the question is what's remaining.,163,,
779,0.97,44113.502,44128.584,"But I want to go to the top part of the slide which is a focus on what has been spent on 2020, about $103 million.",163,,
780,0.97,44128.584,44138.661,"And of the $103 million, what percentage are we going to be seeking FEMA reimbursement for?",163,,
781,0.97,44138.661,44139.295,None.,164,,
782,0.97,44139.295,44140.796,This is Federal money.,164,,
783,0.97,44140.796,44143.165,"You can't just--in some ways, it's the opposite.",164,,
784,0.97,44143.165,44143.833,Got it.,165,,
785,0.97,44143.833,44148.537,We need to be spending these dollars before we dip into FEMA.,166,,
786,0.97,44148.537,44152.174,I wasn't sure what the source was for this fund.,167,,
787,0.97,44152.174,44164.587,You had Referenced earlier that it was a bunch of different sources so it wasn't clear this is all Federal dollars.,167,,
788,0.97,44164.587,44168.891,We can't ask the Federal Government to reimburse us for money they have given us.,167,,
789,0.97,44168.891,44172.261,I appreciate the opportunity to clarify.,168,,
790,0.97,44172.261,44172.561,Thank you.,168,,
791,0.97,44172.561,44183.706,"Councilmember Herbold, I appreciate the question, and director noble, I know you have a few more slides but this slide is very helpful as it relates to CFR.",169,,
792,0.97,44183.706,44208.03,And forgive me if this question and you are going to get to it later but do we have a similar slide where we can see what the city's--what resources are available by someone in the city related to existing FEMA dollars?,169,,
793,0.97,44208.03,44213.035,"Chair Mosqueda, I did have a follow up I think in the same line of questioning.",170,,
794,0.97,44213.035,44214.303,Please go ahead.,171,,
795,0.97,44214.303,44214.57,Yeah.,171,,
796,0.97,44214.57,44234.29,"So what I am seeking here, and I think perhaps, Madam chair, you are as well, it's an understanding of for 2020, what is the total number of dollars that we are seeking reimbursement for to FEMA?",172,,
797,0.97,44234.29,44251.807,"I--I seems to recall from a budget presentation during the rebalancing discussions in June, and the number that was we discussed at the time was $35 million.",172,,
798,0.97,44251.807,44252.508,But I looked.,172,,
799,0.97,44252.508,44256.712,"I can't find sort of an--you know, that was June.",172,,
800,0.97,44256.712,44265.287,And I don't know what assumptions were made after June.,172,,
801,0.97,44265.287,44271.493,So just trying to get a sense of the total number of dollars for 2020.,172,,
802,0.97,44271.493,44275.898,And the next couple slides lead to those exact answers.,173,,
803,0.97,44275.898,44278.634,"That sounds great, Ben.",174,,
804,0.97,44278.634,44296.018,"The three members are what Councilmember Herbold asks, the Reimbursable expenses that have Inoccurred and the current amount for the reimbursement and the Timeline for the reimbursement.",174,,
805,0.97,44296.018,44298.687,I just delineated the question.,174,,
806,0.97,44298.687,44298.921,Yes.,175,,
807,0.97,44298.921,44310.432,I will stick to my slide a bit but just a Detour.,175,,
808,0.97,44310.432,44314.503,The next slide will talk about where we think we are headed.,175,,
809,0.97,44314.503,44337.76,"Just one point I wanted to make before our actual reimbursement process and one that I made earlier, and it's important to that we, the city, are under the FEMA process, we are not the designated lead for fundamentally a public health emergency.",175,,
810,0.97,44337.76,44383.505,"It is, in fact, the public health entity, and it hasn't precluded us from being actively involved but needing to work closely with King County and King County public health also with the state to be designated as an entity that is working, sometimes, for them or in close coordination at a minimum for the emergency and we have our role on shelter and Vaccinations and testing, and just an example of food so that's what allowed us to use FEMA resources in the activities.",175,,
811,0.97,44383.505,44398.954,"In terms of the Ppe for Seattle firefighters and police officers and the like, some of the direct stuff we are doing, we are the lead entity but for the most significant forms of relief, we are not and have been in partnership with others.",175,,
812,0.97,44398.954,44427.282,"And I think that's relevant because when we reported to you in June and I went back to look at the same presentation, Councilmember Herbold, we were protecting the costs to come as much as $45 million which, again, 75 percent rate would have had needing--seek reimbursement in the order of $30 to $35 million.",175,,
813,0.97,44427.282,44454.743,"As it turns out, other entities have stepped up to be the natural lead entity, either King county or the straight, and our FEMA spending hasn't been smaller so in total, we are expecting a significant FEMA reimbursement of $16 million for 2020 expenditures.",175,,
814,0.97,44454.743,44472.094,"That's the TOTE a now, mind you, the expenditures are continuing to 2021 and that Theant be the--won't be the final total.",175,,
815,0.97,44472.094,44476.632,We have submitted $5 million and preparing documentation for the remainder.,175,,
816,0.97,44476.632,44487.676,"And in terms of when we expect to be paid, you know, our initial submitting in October, certainly don't expect this before six months.",175,,
817,0.97,44487.676,44490.746,"Hard to know, and they are talking expedited.",175,,
818,0.97,44490.746,44506.061,"But we don't have a bases to base--basis to give you an estimate, and some cases, the FEMA reimbursement has taken more than a year.",175,,
819,0.97,44506.061,44509.998,That's on the timing what we know.,175,,
820,0.97,44509.998,44521.176,"As I mentioned, I am not particularly concerned about this given again the order, not small amounts of money but the scale of our overall budget.",175,,
821,0.97,44521.176,44546.335,"It's not a significant challenge from the timing on some other revenues that may raise issues to bring to you later but these expenditures are not significant, and again, the Federal dollars are forthcoming to go a language way to address any cash flow concerns.",175,,
822,0.97,44546.335,44548.437,Councilmember Lewis?,176,,
823,0.97,44548.437,44564.253,"Thank you, Madam chair, and getting back to the more Pro- active Federal administration in confronting this emergency in the partnership through cities, we have a visible need for things that are FEMA Reimbursable.",177,,
824,0.97,44564.253,44582.337,"I want to go back to the Crf money Reserve that has been our hedge against the Non- reinforcement, is that money limited in talking about the time frames in the FEMA reimbursement Timelines?",177,,
825,0.97,44582.337,44610.966,"I mean to say if the city were to front the money through some other mechanism to pay for things that we think under the new guidance of FEMA Reimbursable, do we hold the money for as long as it takes to get the reimbursement or does the money turn into a pumpkin at some point and we can't use it if we haven't spent it?",177,,
826,0.97,44610.966,44624.479,I will use the Pumpkin reference myself and my understanding is the end of 2021 which is a challenge to the FEMA Timeline.,178,,
827,0.97,44624.479,44636.692,I will say--I'm going to be careful here but we can probably get creative enough to find a way to hold the reserve of more flexible dollars to carry beyond the end of 2021.,178,,
828,0.97,44636.692,44649.571,"The point is the Crf dollars could some point other activities and freeing up resources that could become the Reserve and if you will, a time left Reserve.",178,,
829,0.97,44649.571,44649.938,So no Pumpkin.,178,,
830,0.97,44649.938,44650.339,Right.,179,,
831,0.97,44650.339,44667.422,And I just wanted to understand that it sounds like the Timeline and hanging on to the Crf money and more designed for the reimbursement --,179,,
832,0.97,44667.422,44689.611,"Let me--on the budgeting side, it's--if the time constraint on 2020 was not lifted, we would have been able to fully expend the Crf and a good deal of Flexiblibility, and the Crf was not--it did allow flexible uses.",180,,
833,0.97,44689.611,44701.156,"We understand have found a way to spend it, and we would have used it to pay for some other costs and held the Reserve as a different funding source, if you will.",180,,
834,0.97,44701.156,44707.796,And we can do that again if that's ultimately what strategically makes sense.,180,,
835,0.97,44707.796,44713.902,"I wouldn't--the time bounds on the Crf, I don't see a significant constraint.",180,,
836,0.97,44713.902,44734.523,"There are currently no time bounds as described on the new Federal dollars which will be an opportunity I think, and I mentioned this in the bullets going forward that we have to think about the Timeline for the use of those resources.",180,,
837,0.97,44734.523,44748.57,"Obviously, there is a huge need immediately but title if we are setting up assistance overtime we have to think about what will be phased out in their own time frame.",180,,
838,0.97,44748.57,44752.574,So you can be super nimble.,181,,
839,0.97,44752.574,44754.743,"Appreciate that, and that's great.",181,,
840,0.97,44754.743,44755.41,I don't have any other.,181,,
841,0.97,44755.41,44761.817,"Excellent question, and thank you very much, Councilmember Lewis.",182,,
842,0.97,44761.817,44765.687,"And the vice chair, any additional follow UPS?",182,,
843,0.97,44765.687,44768.523,I appreciate Councilmember Lewis looking forward.,183,,
844,0.97,44768.523,44788.71,I am still having a bit of trouble understanding 2020 and that we are only anticipating $15 million in FEMA reimbursements.,183,,
845,0.97,44788.71,44799.287,"I am putting together a couple of pieces of information, and in doing so, it makes me feel like yes, it's true.",183,,
846,0.97,44799.287,44845.934,"We don't have a cash flow problem but is that--is that because--I mean, not that I want--that I want a problem but I feel like we--because we've not been aggressive in doing things for our community that we could get FEMA reimbursement based on the belief it would take three years and we have gone to a situation--I appreciate there are other partners that have stepped forward to take the lead and it seems like that should have been an opportunity to say okay.",183,,
847,0.97,44845.934,44847.102,They will do that.,183,,
848,0.97,44847.102,44849.271,What's the other thing we can do?,183,,
849,0.97,44849.271,44872.727,I think one thing that might help me get perspective that might--that I might be lacking right now is some sort of a--is there a material that FEMA is putting out about the reimbursement to other cities across the country just for a reality check to see what reimbursement other jurisdictions across the country are getting?,183,,
850,0.97,44872.727,44878.5,I'll be happy to find out what we can about that.,184,,
851,0.97,44878.5,44890.979,"At a high level, the concerns that cash flow is--I certainly have not put any constraints on the use of FEMA dollars over a cash flow concern.",184,,
852,0.97,44890.979,44893.148,That's not a consideration.,184,,
853,0.97,44893.148,44904.559,"It instead has to do with eligibility and capacity overall to deliver services, and happy to provide the additional information.",184,,
854,0.97,44904.559,44906.795,I am kind of curious myself.,184,,
855,0.97,44906.795,44908.163,"But, Yeah.",184,,
856,0.97,44908.163,44910.966,We'll get that.,184,,
857,0.97,44910.966,44911.9,Thank you so much.,185,,
858,0.97,44911.9,44918.473,"We have 10 more minutes, and I know people to look forward.",186,,
859,0.97,44918.473,44921.109,I was going to suggest --,187,,
860,0.97,44921.109,44921.676,Realty quick.,188,,
861,0.97,44921.676,44931.82,We already submitted for five million and will submit for 10 million more and submitted the initial reimbursement in October.,188,,
862,0.97,44931.82,44938.86,When will we submit for the remaining $10 million?,188,,
863,0.97,44938.86,44974.996,"I don't have a date but one of the things I wanted to mention, and probably the last slide, we have been stepping up in the vaccination space of late, and that is proving to be very complex for the contracting, and again, I want to mention, FEMA--receiving reimbursement is Procuring and documenting very carefully.",189,,
864,0.97,44974.996,44998.787,"The team that was working to submit on 2020 to do the vaccine work, you know, the mass vaccination sites, the bottom line, we want to make sure we do that right.",189,,
865,0.97,44998.787,45015.036,For the bottom line we need additional resources to work on the FEMA processing and use authority for temporary employees.,189,,
866,0.97,45015.036,45018.807,We need to make sure we are being smart about this.,189,,
867,0.97,45018.807,45027.882,"And that was a decision made recently, and are finding out a way to make than.",189,,
868,0.97,45027.882,45039.227,"See, just again, looking forward as we are discussing FEMA's reimbursement 100 percent and retroactively.",189,,
869,0.97,45039.227,45051.94,"I don't want to put too much emphasis on this but we are waiting for the executive order from a high level, and that's what President Biden will sign, and we look forward to make sure we fully understand it.",189,,
870,0.97,45051.94,45061.082,"As I mentioned because we were talking about this, too, we will have some reserve for just the risk of denial.",189,,
871,0.97,45061.082,45079.434,And we are trying to be very careful that we don't end up spending on things that were not eligible or aren't in a position to document spending and we want to be sure we have done the procurement appropriately.,189,,
872,0.97,45079.434,45097.085,So another big point that only happened in the last few weeks and it's a game Changer working forward is that they--FEMA has announced the reimbursement eligibility will extend through September.,189,,
873,0.97,45097.085,45099.788,We had previously been going three months at a time.,189,,
874,0.97,45099.788,45119.541,"It was something that would take a while to do and separate for some time, and we now have time for longer-term planning once we get the information for other Federal money, and then we will figure out how to mix the two screens, if you will, or multiple screens.",189,,
875,0.97,45119.541,45141.663,"So those are big pieces that are different and that we are looking forward to so at the same time, knowing what we know about--well, if the vaccine distribution continues at the pace, it's not unreasonable to think that the FEMA eligibility might be at the end of September as well.",189,,
876,0.97,45141.663,45147.135,But through September a huge advantage in the sense of planning that we didn't have.,189,,
877,0.97,45147.135,45147.402,Okay.,190,,
878,0.97,45147.402,45151.673,Can I ask a quick question about that?,190,,
879,0.97,45151.673,45169.657,"I appreciate that there is a sincere interest in making sure we get 100 percent of the reimbursement, even 75 percent would have been great but 100 percent is fantastic.",190,,
880,0.97,45169.657,45171.86,I am concerned about delays.,190,,
881,0.97,45171.86,45184.572,Are Los Angeles and San Francisco waiting for it or are they moving forward like the headlines say with 100 percent of Federal funds with the articles out of San Francisco and Los Angeles?,190,,
882,0.97,45184.572,45186.908,"I know, again--Yeah.",191,,
883,0.97,45186.908,45187.075,No.,191,,
884,0.97,45187.075,45192.38,That--that is holding us back.,191,,
885,0.97,45192.38,45195.65,I expect going forward 100 percent reimbursement.,191,,
886,0.97,45195.65,45200.388,There are details that we don't have.,191,,
887,0.97,45200.388,45208.029,That's not an issue holding us back in important ways.,191,,
888,0.97,45208.029,45218.773,The over all strategy is whether all expenses that are 100 percent or if there are limitations.,191,,
889,0.97,45218.773,45246.701,"I have not had a chance to talk with you about this before but my concern when I hear that, I am hoping that we are assuming 100 percent of the funds will come, and it seems like other jurisdictions are acting now with broad assumptions that they are going to get reimbursed.",192,,
890,0.97,45246.701,45250.972,So are you also moving forward with implementing various strategies?,192,,
891,0.97,45250.972,45259.213,Are you--how much of this waiting for the Federal guidance is holding back planning?,192,,
892,0.97,45259.213,45261.316,It's not significantly holding back planning.,193,,
893,0.97,45261.316,45268.022,I think the bigger issue going forward will be how to direct a--next slide.,193,,
894,0.97,45268.022,45273.928,So I'll move on.,193,,
895,0.97,45273.928,45279.133,And it's to understand how to direct--you'll see how big it is.,193,,
896,0.97,45279.133,45286.107,"In the next Federal relief package, we'll see how the funding interacts with the FEMA resources.",193,,
897,0.97,45286.107,45296.851,But what we know is there will be significant resources to us and expect to be resolved for the middle of next month.,193,,
898,0.97,45296.851,45300.321,And there is no reason for us to be waiting.,193,,
899,0.97,45300.321,45314.035,"But perfect we make a final decision, we need to know how much will be funded via FEMA or some other source.",193,,
900,0.97,45314.035,45322.81,So we are working on ways to extend and recognize there are additional resources and flexible ones headed our way.,193,,
901,0.97,45322.81,45328.316,So just highlighting there are specifics that we do not have in hand yet.,193,,
902,0.97,45328.316,45334.489,"And more specifically, the details of the bill.",193,,
903,0.97,45334.489,45340.928,"Let's go to the last slide, and I want to make sure we get done on time.",194,,
904,0.97,45340.928,45341.796,Real quick.,195,,
905,0.97,45341.796,45348.069,"As we look forward, what we see here is new opportunities, and Thankfully so.",195,,
906,0.97,45348.069,45361.783,"And if we get new are you sources as described, some of it in a grant for flexible purposes.",195,,
907,0.97,45361.783,45369.057,"But notably, additional resources targeting food and homelessness and various other aspects.",195,,
908,0.97,45369.057,45375.963,So want to understand how much money those are and who they are going to.,195,,
909,0.97,45375.963,45380.368,"In the past, more targeted funding provided at the state or county level, and that's the case.",195,,
910,0.97,45380.368,45390.578,So we want to see where we can fill in and are needed to fill in the service gaps.,195,,
911,0.97,45390.578,45394.982,A little additional guidance from FEMA would be hopeful.,195,,
912,0.97,45394.982,45401.723,And revenue replacement is one of the eligible uses of the Federal dollars that we anticipate.,195,,
913,0.97,45401.723,45422.009,We will be developing a revenue forecast over the course of March to be available in early April that could reveal that we might have revenue replacement from last year or we haven't done the forecast and don't know which way it's going.,195,,
914,0.97,45422.009,45451.539,"And my pessimistic nature, I would note that the revenue up at the we give you in November was closer to the high Watermark in thinking about the economy and the resurgence of Covid over the holiday period has had economic impact but we'll wait to see what the revenue forecast shows and last noted, there are small scale grants working on for part of the overall strategy.",195,,
915,0.97,45451.539,45468.122,The bottom line we are working to learn a good deal more and move quickly to develop an overall and comprehensive proposal to how to use the new resources and remaining resources we highlighted as well.,195,,
916,0.97,45468.122,45470.992,We appreciate your time.,196,,
917,0.97,45470.992,45476.564,Any follow-up questions on the last slide?,196,,
918,0.97,45476.564,45476.898,Okay.,196,,
919,0.97,45476.898,45477.398,Councilmember Herbold?,196,,
920,0.97,45477.398,45481.602,I am having a hard time.,197,,
921,0.97,45481.602,45483.805,I am so sorry.,197,,
922,0.97,45483.805,45485.54,"I have one question, too.",198,,
923,0.97,45485.54,45487.041,Go ahead.,199,,
924,0.97,45487.041,45487.942,Are you sure?,200,,
925,0.97,45487.942,45488.142,Okay.,200,,
926,0.97,45488.142,45504.859,"Just briefly on the last bullet of your last slide there, where did it go, related to the 23 million.",201,,
927,0.97,45504.859,45506.461,"Oh, Yeah.",202,,
928,0.97,45506.461,45506.694,Sorry.,202,,
929,0.97,45506.694,45509.063,"For rental assistance, it's coming soon.",203,,
930,0.97,45509.063,45511.566,We got this budget in December 2020.,203,,
931,0.97,45511.566,45531.652,"Are there delays, and how soon first being a critical date for when rental assistance should be in hand given all of the concerns we have about Eviction prevention and moratorium.",203,,
932,0.97,45531.652,45534.322,Can we anticipate seeing something before April 1?,203,,
933,0.97,45534.322,45534.789,Yes.,204,,
934,0.97,45534.789,45547.502,"The legislation, I don't know where it is in the development schedule but I think next week is too soon to commit but the week following.",204,,
935,0.97,45547.502,45550.438,I share your urgency.,204,,
936,0.97,45550.438,45550.771,I apologize.,204,,
937,0.97,45550.771,45555.443,I had forgotten about the slide.,204,,
938,0.97,45555.443,45564.018,"There is unfortunate on the funding side, and just on your observation on what is happening in Los Angeles, we are not holding back.",204,,
939,0.97,45564.018,45571.259,Hsd was looking at resources running out for the extended food banks and food delivery contracts.,204,,
940,0.97,45571.259,45580.668,"We will use the existing budget authority for 2021 and they will continue the work, about half a million a month to extend the contracts.",204,,
941,0.97,45580.668,45592.38,"Ultimately, we will need additional funding to see where it will come from now, and so, that--so that is an existing program that we will continue.",204,,
942,0.97,45592.38,45608.963,Ose looking at a couple hundred thousand dollars of additional Cost-Related--the grocery Intj used use--budget is used at a higher rate than early on.,204,,
943,0.97,45608.963,45616.304,The Hoteling work and the expected announcement on the progress next week will cost us more than anticipated.,204,,
944,0.97,45616.304,45621.709,The budget authority will cover that expense.,204,,
945,0.97,45621.709,45642.263,"So, again, that mass vaccination is going forward as well, and yes, $23 million and part of the $900 million package passed last year from the Federal Government, a direct $23 million for rental assistance and legislation to follow up shortly.",204,,
946,0.97,45642.263,45647.969,"Councilmember Herbold, follow up?",205,,
947,0.97,45647.969,45648.536,Yeah.,206,,
948,0.97,45648.536,45670.524,"So the question of whether or not we're leaving FEMA dollars on the table is a question that looms large in my mind, and director noble, I am not in any way suggesting that you are putting up any bureaucratic totals because of concerns about cash flow.",206,,
949,0.97,45670.524,45700.688,"I just feel like, for instance, in June, we anticipated spending that would require us to seek $35 million in FEMA reimbursement, and we had other partners who took the lead, and now it's like $15 million.",206,,
950,0.97,45700.688,45721.976,I think we should be notified of the change when it was like we were thinking of seeking $35 million in FEMA reimbursement but we don't need to based on other jurisdictions coming forward fulfilling the need.,206,,
951,0.97,45721.976,45724.378,There is great need in the community.,206,,
952,0.97,45724.378,45734.088,What other things can we do to meet those needs?,206,,
953,0.97,45734.088,45791.879,"I am hoping moving forward we can be more nimble when the FEMA reimbursements aren't realized and specific to this moment in time, I appreciate that it's important for us to think about sort of an overall plan for addressing community needs and which of the needs we might want to address will be Reimbursable but we, in this moment in time, we heard from folks in the public comment today that a program that operates in two Seattle neighborhoods will stop operating on the 15th of March operating to the tune of $6.5 million in King County.",206,,
954,0.97,45791.879,45793.681,Some describe it as a King County program.,206,,
955,0.97,45793.681,45800.321,I don't see it as a King County program.,206,,
956,0.97,45800.321,45807.128,We agreed that homelessness is a regional challenge.,206,,
957,0.97,45807.128,45822.61,"King County, those are two Seattle neighborhoods but they have contributed to the support of the program through C.A.R.",206,,
958,0.97,45832.987,45833.42,E.S.,206,,
959,0.97,45833.42,45840.427,Act funding and the county doesn't feel it can help because there is no additional C.A.R.E.S.,206,,
960,0.97,45840.427,45852.873,"Act funding, and for their understanding of the restrictions around FEMA since the locations in Seattle, they'll not be able to get FEMA reimbursements through King County for those locations.",206,,
961,0.97,45852.873,45881.769,"So I just feel like we need to be acting in a way that is--that is more nimble and more creative and, you know, and again, I am not suggesting you are putting up bureaucratic hurdles but that we are, as a city responding Bureaucratically to the need out there.",206,,
962,0.97,45881.769,45887.007,"Councilmember Herbold, I appreciate that and appreciate the public testimony from this morning.",207,,
963,0.97,45887.007,45926.146,"I do want to note that your points are very well taken and I think that there is an opportunity as we look at 2021, the funding on the horizon, and the potential for vaccine distribution and all the folks who are looking at us both as a city and a county to come up with a solution so people can open up and open up safely, and we know that the funding has been provided for folks for food security and housing assistance and the $1.9 trillion package that we heard about will be a huge opportunity for us to come together.",207,,
964,0.97,45926.146,45987.908,"If there is the ability for us to get anywhere near the $221 million that was noted and recognizing that we will continue to have ongoing operational costs and funding put forward and redirected to Covid relief, I think there is a huge opportunity for the Council to do what we have done before, and we have in various budget processes over the years come up with a solution from the Mayor's office, and what I am interested in doing with all of you is to have a resolution that brings up the discussion of the potential dollars and the available funds in front of us and the 80--the ability to see where the funds go and how quickly into the programs, supporting the homeless population and small businesses and from the DIA and our most vulnerable communities.",207,,
965,0.97,45987.908,46030.818,"I want to flag that I appreciate what you said, and I look forward to hearing director noble's answer and I know Councilmember Lewis has a question, and I think in the next two weeks we need to put suggestions on the details for how the dollar amounts should be used and strategies and the values that the Mayor and King County partners have begun to look at and we want to move fast and make sure there are no additional delays and get a draft together for all of us to provide feed back for additional Covid relief and make sure that is in hand for discussion with all of the input by the March 2 meeting.",207,,
966,0.97,46030.818,46057.478,"I think this will be an opportunity to show how we can be a good partner with King County especially as I mentioned before, and you commented that they stepped up and stood in to provide directives, but this is a great opportunity for us to do more as a partner in that area as well.",207,,
967,0.97,46057.478,46065.786,"Councilmember Lewis, and then director noble, I didn't mean to cut you off.",207,,
968,0.97,46065.786,46069.323,"I know we are overtime, and we know it to wrap up.",207,,
969,0.97,46069.323,46083.971,"Just a technical clarification, and it builds off what Councilmember Herbold said.",208,,
970,0.97,46083.971,46090.077,This is related to King County's authority and what they can and can't pay for.,208,,
971,0.97,46090.077,46097.985,"So related to the FEMA reimbursement, what are those Guardrails?",208,,
972,0.97,46097.985,46107.227,Like can King County only do FEMA Reimbursable expenses in the communities with the policing powers like so unincorporated King County?,208,,
973,0.97,46107.227,46123.01,Is that the hurdle and why they might not be able to pursue certain FEMA reimbursement avenues.,208,,
974,0.97,46123.01,46125.779,Can we maybe cover that?,208,,
975,0.97,46125.779,46180.567,"I do not expect to be a FEMA expert by any means, but public health in many aspects, and they work with the county of public health, and Similarly, for Vaccinations, as I understand it, it's more of a state level and the delegation has considered where we are directly involved as well.",209,,
976,0.97,46180.567,46186.373,"Do you have any other responses--sorry, Councilmember Lewis.",210,,
977,0.97,46186.373,46198.218,"Director noble, for homelessness, is that a function that the public health has designated for constituent cities?",211,,
978,0.97,46198.218,46207.628,The key issue is public health with congregate and Non- congregate housing.,212,,
979,0.97,46207.628,46228.415,"They have seemed that the Non- congregate arrangement is the appropriate one, and we have partnered with the county to give the direction, and in public health, we are in a position to submit the cost of moving the existing shelters to--to Non-Congregate settings.",212,,
980,0.97,46228.415,46246.567,"And those expenses are FEMA eligible, if you will, to waive the public health letter as part of the Commission and similarly in terms of establishing new congregate shelters, that's the idea.",212,,
981,0.97,46246.567,46267.554,"And I don't have the details of the program, so I can't speak to that, and in terms of the FEMA resource to highlight the point that I made earlier, having a planning window through the end of September gives us more opportunities to support the dollars strategically.",212,,
982,0.97,46267.554,46290.344,"What kind of expenses are eligible, it's the procurement process which is a critical one and also, the infusion of Federal dollars we are anticipating, whether FEMA or some other money, and that's the best one to apply different funding needs, and we will have a better opportunity to explore, if you will.",212,,
983,0.97,46290.344,46295.882,We will have new and potentially more flexible resources available as well.,212,,
984,0.97,46295.882,46303.957,I a Pologize to the Council President.,213,,
985,0.97,46303.957,46307.694,She has had her hand raised.,213,,
986,0.97,46307.694,46311.331,I apologize for keeping you waiting.,213,,
987,0.97,46311.331,46312.199,"Oh, no worries.",214,,
988,0.97,46312.199,46326.279,This Ducktails off what director noble just said which is providing a response of sorts to director Herbold.,214,,
989,0.97,46326.279,46340.861,I just wanted to make sure looking at this issue of FEMA reimbursement that we are taking in sort of the opportunity to look at the whole system.,214,,
990,0.97,46340.861,46359.646,"And Systemically, what do we want to fund with the FEMA reimbursement dollars or hope to be able to implement now and plan and implement for now that we think will allow us to get maximum reimbursement from these FEMA dollars.",214,,
991,0.97,46359.646,46367.988,"So, I guess, you know, I heard a lot of public testimony this morning.",214,,
992,0.97,46367.988,46368.755,"Yes, this morning?",214,,
993,0.97,46368.755,46439.126,"It was about this specific program and--and I want to make sue we are not basing decisions on one single program and looking at a spectrum of interventions that will be necessary of which this program is part of that--that spectrum, and that in the stream of intervention, and I want to make sure we are taking a step back and look from the 30,000 foot level and making sure that with this unique and historic opportunity to get up to 100 percent FEMA reimbursement, for this Pandemics and for so long as public health is directing us, frankly, to stand up Non-Congregate shelter and the needs of people.",214,,
994,0.97,46439.126,46440.594,Thank you.,214,,
995,0.97,46440.594,46451.138,"Thank you, Madam President.",215,,
996,0.97,46455.876,46463.483,"Director noble, any comment?",215,,
997,0.97,46463.483,46466.086,Not at this time.,216,,
998,0.97,46466.086,46483.336,And we are assuming 100 percent reimbursement and making sure there is an understanding,217,,
999,0.97,46498.318,46507.427,We were expecting--only 15 has been spent.,218,,
1000,0.97,46507.427,46521.208,And we want to be a good partner with King County.,218,,
1001,0.97,46521.208,46556.843,"I think there's a lot of, there's a lot of concern on my attendant we're not moving as fast and if you have any comments, we'll have rental assistance to prevent more homelessness.",218,,
1002,0.97,46556.843,46558.879,Okay.,219,,
1003,0.97,46558.879,46560.113,Anything else before wrapping up?,219,,
1004,0.97,46560.113,46565.118,I'm excited about going forward.,220,,
1005,0.97,46565.118,46568.922,We'll have some significant resources.,220,,
1006,0.97,46568.922,46570.757,To be optimistic.,221,,
1007,0.97,46570.757,46573.193,Look forward to working with you.,221,,
1008,0.97,46573.193,46574.027,Thanks to our colleagues.,221,,
1009,0.97,46574.027,46578.298,"We're about 20 minutes over, so I thank you for your extra time today.",221,,
1010,0.97,46578.298,46592.412,If folks are able to join Pus again on March 2ND at 9:30 we'll have a discussion that was delayed to on the capital projects watch list and thank you for walking us through that.,221,,
1011,0.97,46592.412,46594.548,Look forward to hearing additions you may all have.,221,,
1012,0.97,46594.548,46600.654,Do you have anything on that piece?,221,,
1013,0.97,46600.654,46600.854,Okay.,221,,
1014,0.97,46600.854,46603.056,Great.,221,,

1016,0.97,46606.226,46626.746,"So if you do have any Edits or items you would like to see added, please let me know and we will continue this conversation around Federal relief make sure we get the dollars in hand and working with our original partners as well.",221,,
1017,0.97,46626.746,46628.048,Thanks for your time.,221,,
