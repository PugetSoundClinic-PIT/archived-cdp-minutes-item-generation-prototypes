24,0.97,172.505,175.842,This resolution 32029 should be rejected out of principle.,7,,
25,0.97,175.842,187.387,It was introduced after Council lost election who now wants to change the rules for public comment and shorten a workweek to accommodate a four day weekend.,7,,
26,0.97,187.387,198.565,If city council staff doesn't like to work for the people they should find another line of work.,7,,
27,0.97,198.565,206.873,This city Council has been abusing virtual meetings.,7,,
28,0.97,206.873,210.677,Everybody else has to go back to work.,7,,
29,0.97,210.677,214.948,This democracy is not councils and their staffs alone.,7,,
30,0.97,214.948,227.227,It's the people's democracy and you're further limiting access to our democracy with this resolution that was introduced by a politician who is taking away from our resolution.,7,,
31,0.97,227.227,230.463,Especially after the people rose up against Council.,7,,

65,0.97,478.811,486.485,Joining me for the presentation today are member representatives of the Council rules review working group.,13,,
66,0.97,486.485,512.545,"As stated Elizabeth Adkinson deputy director for the city of clerk and director of Council city staff the group is comprised of the Council President's December Designee Cody Ryder, Gary Smith and Brandon Isla.",13,,
67,0.97,512.545,526.125,The full working group convened between September and November of 2021 to review proposed changes to the rules and to prepare recommendations for consideration by the city council.,13,,
68,0.97,526.125,547.68,Today our abbreviated team if you will will provide a summary of the working review process and highlight the proposed changes and also review the process for any amendments that may be requested by the city council members moving forward.,13,,
69,0.97,547.68,560.793,Proposals there are some proposals that have not yet been incorporated into the proposed resolution as we believe as a working group that they want further discussion and deliberation by the city council.,13,,
70,0.97,560.793,563.696,That process again will be reviewed by director handy.,13,,
71,0.97,563.696,580.947,The public comment period just to note that public comment period that has been in effect will be running through December 11th and any written public comment that has been received by our office is distributed to the city council upon receipt.,13,,
72,0.97,580.947,586.552,So you will be receiving that as we go through the 11th.,13,,
73,0.97,586.552,605.438,"Again please feel free to answer, to ask any questions or seek clarification as we're making the presentations of these items and we too encourage your just your full engagement, please share your direct feed back and opinions with us.",13,,
74,0.97,605.438,611.377,That will better inform how we can develop further recommendations that are coming from the Council.,13,,
75,0.97,611.377,612.244,So we encourage that.,13,,
76,0.97,612.244,623.189,At this time I will go ahead and turn the time over to Elizabeth and then Elizabeth will be followed by our director handy.,13,,
77,0.97,623.189,624.624,Thank you Council President.,13,,
78,0.97,624.624,629.295,Thank you Monica and good afternoon Council members.,14,,
79,0.97,629.295,638.404,As a brief overview again of our time line and process this is our biannual review of the Council rules which is prescribed in the rules Themselvesless.,14,,
80,0.97,638.404,642.274,And so 2021 was the next year to go through this cycle.,14,,
81,0.97,642.274,653.552,We started off in September with the working group review and proposed amendments that had been collected over the past two years for potential addressing through this cycle.,14,,
82,0.97,653.552,660.96,And brought forward a resolution that incorporated a number of these Ieas and introduced to the city council on November 15th.,14,,
83,0.97,660.96,679.211,"As Monica mentioned, this is one we also opened up to public comment period which will continue through December 11th and include the opportunity to submit written comments and also to attend three meetings and provide public comment.",14,,
84,0.97,679.211,697.697,At the Governance and education committee we will have a meeting on December 4TH and a meeting on December 8th when is when we will expect Hearingamendments and recommendations for potential adoption at that time.,14,,
85,0.97,697.697,709.275,Included in the resolution that has been presented are a number of proposed recommendations.,14,,
86,0.97,709.275,713.279,Like holding public meetings into the future.,14,,
87,0.97,713.279,721.253,And those would be meeting where there would be a public aspect and virtual aspect.,14,,
88,0.97,721.253,724.29,Those items are put into the rules.,14,,
89,0.97,724.29,733.132,It also includes sponsorship at legislation and amendments there too.,14,,
90,0.97,733.132,742.441,"It also imposes membership, participation and rules Andcommittee members and Noncommittee members in our structure that we adopt every two years.",14,,
91,0.97,742.441,753.285,It makes a few proposed amendments to our procedures regarding a few of the motions we use on a few of our bases as well as updates us to our next rules of order.,14,,
92,0.97,753.285,767.266,It also includes a few technical and clarifying language changes addressing cross references and terms of use that we felt could use some recommendations.,14,,
93,0.97,767.266,771.403,That's an overview of the proposed amendments that have been recommended at this time.,14,,
94,0.97,771.403,782.281,I will send to director handy to go into more detail with you and bring up the policy considerations.,14,,
95,0.97,782.281,782.581,Thank you.,14,,
96,0.97,782.581,783.582,Thanks.,15,,
97,0.97,783.582,785.217,Thank you hello committee members.,15,,
98,0.97,785.217,786.418,"Director of your Council, central staff.",15,,
99,0.97,786.418,792.491,I will walk through the 14 changes that are in the resolution in front of you.,15,,
100,0.97,792.491,806.438,If you want to pull the memo up we will give a visual both for the public and Council members as we walk through these.,15,,
101,0.97,806.438,809.175,I can also share my screen if that is easier.,15,,
102,0.97,809.175,815.514,She will probably just need a couple of seconds to pull the right screen.,16,,
103,0.97,815.514,829.128,"No problem, if she does so Maybe I will just start with the first one which is Fairlystraightforward.",17,,
104,0.97,829.128,833.432,As Elizabeth mentioned addresses hybrid and virtual meetings.,17,,
105,0.97,833.432,840.739,"There's a new rule that allows virtual comment, removes language that pertains to in person only references to Council meetings.",17,,
106,0.97,840.739,850.449,The proposed changes in the base resolution do not require the Council to offer virtual alternatives to public comment.,17,,
107,0.97,850.449,864.43,But rather makes it permissive creating the flexibility for the council as you begin envisions what Council deliberations will look like in a Postcovid or the next phase of the Covid world.,17,,
108,0.97,864.43,868.534,We can go to the next page.,17,,
109,0.97,868.534,870.569,The second set of changes relate to sponsorship.,17,,
110,0.97,870.569,878.277,And it clarifies the role of a sponsor on legislation and amendments.,17,,
111,0.97,878.277,884.884,The first adds language so that legislation does not require a sponsor to be introduced.,17,,
112,0.97,884.884,894.994,So occasionally the Council gets a bill that is necessary for the continuity of city business but not necessarily a bill that is championed by a member of the Council.,17,,
113,0.97,894.994,898.631,This allow it is Council President to introduce and keep that bill moving.,17,,
114,0.97,898.631,905.304,"The second, if we can go to page two we needed a chance.",17,,
115,0.97,905.304,911.277,"Adds language that afford introduction, cosponsors who are added outside of open meetings shall not exceed the form of the committee.",17,,
116,0.97,911.277,916.548,So if there are five members of the committee with a Quorum of three.,17,,
117,0.97,916.548,921.253,Three should be added and the rest should be added in Postintroduction in open session.,17,,
118,0.97,921.253,926.659,Can you give us a minute.,18,,
119,0.97,926.659,928.961,I think there's some delay issues.,18,,
120,0.97,928.961,932.064,So she was having a hard time.,18,,
121,0.97,932.064,933.232,Got it.,19,,
122,0.97,933.232,935.434,She's a little behind you.,20,,
123,0.97,935.434,938.837,Not intentionally but I think there were some lag issues on her end.,20,,
124,0.97,938.837,941.173,I think she's caught up now.,20,,
125,0.97,941.173,951.583,Can you confirm that you are able to hear us in Realtime.,20,,
126,0.97,951.583,954.453,Looks like she's still struggling with the Scrolling here.,20,,
127,0.97,954.453,966.999,"We may need you to share your Screene Esther, I know that's not ideal.",20,,
128,0.97,966.999,967.533,I think we're close.,21,,
129,0.97,967.533,969.301,Right there is right where we're add.,21,,
130,0.97,969.301,979.111,"If you can adjust your screen, it's looking a little.",22,,
131,0.97,979.111,984.216,We're on number three is that right.,22,,
132,0.97,984.216,986.819,"Yes, I just mentioned Thesponsorship.",23,,
133,0.97,986.819,988.687,I will move on if there are no questions.,23,,
134,0.97,988.687,992.458,We will take questions at the end.,24,,
135,0.97,992.458,998.831,Why don't you finish your presentation and we will circle back around and take questions.,24,,
136,0.97,998.831,1000.199,The third part participation.,25,,
137,0.97,1000.199,1010.576,This says only Council member who is are designated members of the committee or who are serving as the alternate may sponsor legislation or amendments before the committee.,25,,
138,0.97,1010.576,1016.749,So when a bill comes for introduction any Council member may sponsor that bill to get it introduced to the Council.,25,,
139,0.97,1016.749,1021.687,"Once it has been referred to a committee, only committee members may sponsor amendments.",25,,
140,0.97,1021.687,1030.295,There has been some questions and a little bit of confusion from Council members about what it means to sponsor legislation after introduction.,25,,
141,0.97,1030.295,1037.069,The working group is working on a technical clean up amendment that we would like to offer forward there to clarify any confusion.,25,,
142,0.97,1037.069,1045.778,"This is really about, somebody who is not on a committee may author an amendment, you would need someone in the committee to sponsor it.",25,,
143,0.97,1301.266,1305.537,This was the current practice but was not clarified in the rules.,26,,
144,0.97,1305.537,1312.544,Then the last couple here number 13 and 14 are technical and clarifying language changes.,26,,
145,0.97,1312.544,1315.747,The first clarifies the difference between a divided vote and a divided report.,26,,
146,0.97,1315.747,1318.216,The vote is the vote that is taken.,26,,
147,0.97,1318.216,1330.195,A report is a report that is written to go along the with the agenda to represent a minority opinion in Council's history.,26,,
148,0.97,1330.195,1334.666,A divided report was a required item to go along with divided votes.,26,,
149,0.97,1334.666,1337.269,Several years ago it was changed to be optional.,26,,
150,0.97,1337.269,1342.874,It's our understanding it hasn't been used in quite a few years.,26,,
151,0.97,1342.874,1354.619,So Council members may have interest in removing this entirely from the rules or Revisiting this practice.,26,,
152,0.97,1354.619,1358.123,The clarifying amendment clarifying the amendment between report.,26,,
153,0.97,1358.123,1367.599,Motions to hold to a certain time or hold indefinitely have been amended to use the word postpone.,26,,
154,0.97,1367.599,1379.111,That is often a language used on a bias.,26,,
155,0.97,1379.111,1389.054,And the hope is to bring it back at a later time.,26,,
156,0.97,1389.054,1392.09,So those are the changes changes.,26,,
157,0.97,1392.09,1392.924,We will take questions on that.,26,,
158,0.97,1392.924,1393.458,And we will move on.,26,,
159,0.97,1393.458,1407.139,I think this is a good place for us to stop with the 14 items that director handy has just briefed us on.,27,,
160,0.97,1407.139,1409.374,Are all included in the base resolution.,27,,
161,0.97,1409.374,1420.886,Obviously they're still subject to amendment and further change but colleagues this is an opportunity for you to ask any questions of the staff work group.,27,,
162,0.97,1420.886,1425.957,And to express any concerns or interests in bringing forward potential amendments.,27,,
163,0.97,1425.957,1434.699,"I also do want to add that we were joined by Council Membermosqueda, Herbold and Morales.",27,,
164,0.97,1434.699,1438.67,I'm going to open it up to folks who may want to ask questions.,27,,
165,0.97,1438.67,1441.973,I do see that Council member Herbold has raised her hand.,27,,
166,0.97,1441.973,1442.307,"Yes, please.",27,,
167,0.97,1442.307,1446.645,I have a couple of questions.,28,,
168,0.97,1446.645,1466.865,But first one that comes to mind relates to a couple of the issues around sponsorship of legislation and as it relates to a Quorum Preintroduction.,28,,
169,0.97,1466.865,1498.129,"Given that Quorum is a majority of Council members, I'm struggling to understand how that would be permissive under Opma and why the limitation Onsponsorship Preintroduction would not be and why that would not be limited to under Quorum.",28,,
170,0.97,1498.129,1512.444,Yeah I was just searching the technical language on the resolution to see if it is not up to Quorum or up to Quorum.,29,,
171,0.97,1512.444,1521.119,If you will give me a minute to clarify or if you know the answer to that.,29,,
172,0.97,1521.119,1524.222,Works for me.,30,,
173,0.97,1524.222,1526.691,If I may clarify the question about sponsorship.,30,,
174,0.97,1526.691,1531.396,Simmons would you like to add something for that.,31,,
175,0.97,1531.396,1532.831,You are muted.,31,,
176,0.97,1532.831,1547.178,We will look to look at specific language before we answer Council member Herbold.,32,,
177,0.97,1547.178,1558.189,"Council member her bold, Herbo Whr-Rbgs D. I want told.",33,,
178,0.97,1558.189,1563.828,I would like to clear clarify also.,33,,
179,0.97,1563.828,1574.406,The reason why we made created that would.,33,,
180,0.97,1574.406,1578.209,The revisions would allow for that to happen or designate that that could happen I think we need to Revisit that.,33,,
181,0.97,1578.209,1592.49,Clean it up and make sure that we are not opening that door once again.,33,,
182,0.97,1592.49,1598.096,Yeah thank you the language shall not exceed a Quorum.,34,,
183,0.97,1598.096,1602.734,We will look at that and make sure that does not exceed a Quorum.,34,,
184,0.97,1602.734,1608.84,Shall not exceed the Quorum is you can reach a Quorum but not go over a Quorum.,35,,
185,0.97,1608.84,1610.442,I think that may be an oversight.,35,,
186,0.97,1610.442,1614.512,So we will need to bring forward a technical amendment to correct for that.,35,,
187,0.97,1614.512,1622.253,And to account for the fact that it cannot be a Quorum or an excess of a Quorum.,35,,
188,0.97,1622.253,1626.458,"Council member Herbold, please thank you so much.",35,,
189,0.97,1626.458,1635.4,And my other question relates to issue of who can sponsor legislation.,36,,
190,0.97,1635.4,1643.642,I appreciate Dr. handy that you flagged the issue of what it means to sponsor legislation Postintroduction.,36,,
191,0.97,1643.642,1658.189,We think that might mean either an amendment to the legislation or a substitute which Istechnically an amendment but it could be considered legislation.,36,,
192,0.97,1658.189,1674.372,"But just want to just clarify that, the ability to sponsor legislation in the proposed rules is a power that only committee members seem to have.",36,,
193,0.97,1674.372,1691.389,And just wanting to just flag that we want to make sure that the intent is reflected in the legislation changing the rules as well.,36,,
194,0.97,1691.389,1700.131,And would love to understand exactly what the intent is here.,36,,
195,0.97,1700.131,1713.411,"Are we intending to limit the ability of, of Noncouncil members from sponsoring legislation that would go to a committee that they do not serve on.",36,,
196,0.97,1713.411,1714.913,Thanks for the question.,37,,
197,0.97,1714.913,1722.987,No the intention here is that any Council member may sponsor any piece of legislation at introduction.,37,,
198,0.97,1722.987,1734.232,So if somebody would like to advance a piece of legislation for the Governance of education committee and they're not on committee.,37,,
199,0.97,1734.232,1737.869,Maybe something this they authored and be the sponsor at the point of introduction.,37,,
200,0.97,1737.869,1742.14,The intention here is once a bill is referred to a committee.,37,,
201,0.97,1742.14,1753.685,It is the jurisdiction of the members of that committee to deliberate on and make a recommendation to the Council.,37,,
202,0.97,1753.685,1758.623,At the point that it's at Committee it is left at committee and back at full council.,37,,
203,0.97,1758.623,1760.658,Does that clarify.,37,,
204,0.97,1760.658,1760.959,It does.,38,,
205,0.97,1760.959,1761.659,Thank you.,38,,
206,0.97,1761.659,1768.199,"But I do, at least I'm doing a plain reading of the language.",38,,
207,0.97,1768.199,1780.445,"There's the question of that you flagged Dr. handy of what does it mean to as a, to introduce legislation.",38,,
208,0.97,1780.445,1784.082,In a committee after the IRC process.,38,,
209,0.97,1784.082,1797.228,I also am flagging that red line version of the legislation seems to limit the sponsorship of legislation to committee members.,38,,
210,0.97,1797.228,1810.441,It's our intention for the work group to offer a clean up of that to remove the word legislation so it just reads amendment in that section.,39,,
211,0.97,1810.441,1813.878,To retain the intent I described.,39,,
212,0.97,1813.878,1814.445,Thank you.,40,,
213,0.97,1814.445,1826.457,Director handy just to be clear the intent is sort of allowing Council members to exercise their legislative authority.,41,,
214,0.97,1826.457,1834.465,"Regardless of committee membership that we're talking about, I think we're talking about a temporal point.",41,,
215,0.97,1834.465,1859.29,"So it's at the point of introduction and referral so if a council member who wasn't a member of the Governance and education Committee, wanted to introduce legislation that gave all public school students free ice cream they could do that, but once it's referred to the Governance and education committee which they're no longer a member of.",41,,
216,0.97,1859.29,1875.24,At that point after the referral they would need to work with the chair as an author of either a Striker bill or amendment in order for those amendments to advance.,41,,
217,0.97,1875.24,1880.211,That is correct.,42,,
218,0.97,1880.211,1888.152,They may offer free ice free ice cream to all on the rules and make a recommendation on that idea.,42,,
219,0.97,1888.152,1908.673,Obviously full council is always an opportunity for any Council member regardless of committee membership to bring forward amendments that we try to encourage substantive policy issues to happen during committee.,43,,
220,0.97,1908.673,1909.073,That's great.,44,,
221,0.97,1909.073,1910.441,Council member Herbold anything else.,44,,
222,0.97,1910.441,1917.015,I have one other question not about sponsorship but about something that was covered in this initial portion of the briefing.,45,,
223,0.97,1917.015,1918.449,Is that okay.,45,,
224,0.97,1918.449,1921.319,"Yeah, go ahead.",46,,
225,0.97,1921.319,1923.755,Thank you.,47,,
226,0.97,1923.755,1942.573,"As it relates specifically to the intent to clarify, for the record, who is a voting member of a meeting in the case that there is a need for an alternate I just want to confirm, my understanding.",47,,
227,0.97,1942.573,1946.344,These are rules that can be waved in individual circumstances.,47,,
228,0.97,1946.344,1969.233,I can imagine a sort of a Brokered agreement of a regular committee member with an alternate for which a portion of the meeting each would attend and be an alternate.,47,,
229,0.97,1969.233,1971.135,I understand not putting a position.,47,,
230,0.97,1971.135,2004.802,"About having the question of preparing for a meeting where they may or may not have whole voting rights but I could see that, that difficulty could be where the council member and alternate agree and just want to make sure that that is confirmed that that would be possible with approval waive of the rules.",47,,
231,0.97,2004.802,2020.918,Yes that's my understanding and on the committee agenda today is an attachment a for where that action is not allowed.,48,,
232,0.97,2020.918,2040.872,"But the one you were describing, the role of the alternate could be suspended with the motion.",48,,
233,0.97,2040.872,2044.542,And I would ask the Council.,48,,
234,0.97,2044.542,2052.383,"Council member Strauss, after Council member Strauss will be Council member Morales.",49,,
235,0.97,2052.383,2055.319,My question is to have a legislative sponsor without a sponsor.,50,,
236,0.97,2055.319,2061.893,I don't know where I am on this point.,50,,
237,0.97,2061.893,2069.133,Because I understand the need to have routine legislation that is for good Governance.,50,,
238,0.97,2069.133,2079.177,There's been time there's been legislation written by the executive that I put my name on because when it's transmitted someone has to put their name on it when it's at committee and I do so.,50,,
239,0.97,2079.177,2084.615,I just want to get an understanding on why this is being considered now and if there are any parameters on it.,50,,
240,0.97,2084.615,2095.96,I guess I'll be forthright with my concern that if we allow this to occur without parameters that somebody can sponsor legislation without having to put their name on it.,50,,
241,0.97,2095.96,2106.337,S that not routine in Gov Governance just looking for more information at the time.,50,,
242,0.97,2106.337,2110.308,I would like to ask for committee if you would like to weigh in here.,51,,
243,0.97,2110.308,2113.644,My understanding is this would be used fairly rarely.,51,,
244,0.97,2113.644,2121.018,It would still require the decision of the Council President to introduce it.,51,,
245,0.97,2121.018,2142.473,"Bills that come forward without a sponsor wouldn't automatically make it into the realm of Council business but it's an option that Council members have wanted to have when they have said this is an important piece of city business but not necessarily something that I'm Championing for my district, council member Strauss I appreciate the example you gave.",51,,
246,0.97,2142.473,2147.478,There are times you put your name on that any way.,51,,
247,0.97,2147.478,2161.159,But it is to address those circumstances and again I think the main check on this would be the role of the council member who is making decisions about when a bill of any kind gets added to the introduction referral calendar.,51,,
248,0.97,2161.159,2167.665,I'll just add a little bit of texture to that.,52,,
249,0.97,2167.665,2168.799,It is rare.,52,,
250,0.97,2168.799,2178.242,The instances in which a piece of legislation would have no sponsor attached to it is very rare.,52,,
251,0.97,2178.242,2180.912,It is not unprecedented however as rare as it might be.,52,,
252,0.97,2180.912,2189.12,I'll give you an example of how this played out in real life for us last year.,52,,
253,0.97,2189.12,2193.157,Or I guess it was maybe this year.,52,,
254,0.97,2193.157,2193.457,This year.,52,,
255,0.97,2193.457,2210.641,"We were asked in two different instances to consider legislation that would allow for a council member, a current Council member and the current Mayor to receive reimbursement for legal fees related to recall petitions.",52,,
256,0.97,2210.641,2224.755,"And in both those instances, we were unable to find the council member willing to sponsor those pieces of legislation being advanced by the executive and from a council member.",52,,
257,0.97,2224.755,2246.811,And as a result we still needed to list it on a docket and have it introduced and referred and Deliberated and having the flexibility from the Council President's perspective to allow that Governance legislation to advance without a sponsor was important.,52,,
258,0.97,2246.811,2262.526,So I think making sure that we have reflected in the rules that this is allowable and Institutionalizing the ability to have the discretion to make that call.,52,,
259,0.97,2262.526,2274.338,Particular in the circumstance of in which a Council in which a council member cannot be found to sponsor such legislation I think is important.,52,,
260,0.97,2274.338,2288.119,Otherwise the legislation cannot and will not advance even if it is technical in nature or necessary for the advancement of continuity of Governance.,52,,
261,0.97,2288.119,2297.028,That's a real life example of two pieces of legislation that we dealt with this reality just this year in 2021.,52,,
262,0.97,2297.028,2300.064,"So very rare, I think those are the only two instances I can think of.",52,,
263,0.97,2300.064,2310.441,Off the top of my head there might be others that I'm missing but I would say that it's quite literally a small small handful.,52,,
264,0.97,2310.441,2314.445,Thank you Council President.,53,,
265,0.97,2314.445,2321.118,S that very helpful and thank you director handy.,53,,
266,0.97,2321.118,2333.13,I will say that in it current content I'm not comfortable with the language described with what you just had I will take time to reflect on this I don't know where I will land.,53,,
267,0.97,2333.13,2342.473,But I will tell you that at start I would need to at minimum see the parameters to feel comfortable with it.,53,,
268,0.97,2342.473,2346.01,"Just describing what you just said, so.",53,,
269,0.97,2346.01,2357.254,I would say Council member Strauss if you have parameters that you would like to put on the table now I would Encounselor you to daylight those now.,54,,
270,0.97,2357.254,2363.494,"And then Secondly I would say that,--table now that I would encourage you to daylight those now.",54,,
271,0.97,2363.494,2385.75,And then Secondly I would say that it is incredibly rare and I also think that the future president of the Council needs to have some discretion in being able to accommodate what is a consensus body will.,54,,
272,0.97,2385.75,2388.252,In the moment.,54,,
273,0.97,2388.252,2400.264,"So it's hard to come up with particular prescriptions on this that would, that would still sort of facilitate for a legislation that needs to advance to actually advance.",54,,
274,0.97,2400.264,2415.146,The consequence of not having this rule in my mind is that legislation that needs to be considered for the sake of Governance cannot advance because it requires a sponsor.,54,,
275,0.97,2415.146,2427.391,"If we're unable to get a council member to agree to sponsor something in due course, then that falls on the Council President to either sponsor it or to table the legislation indefinitely.",54,,
276,0.97,2427.391,2429.36,In other words not introduce it.,54,,
277,0.97,2429.36,2430.294,Right.,55,,
278,0.97,2430.294,2432.63,Thank you that's helpful.,56,,
279,0.97,2432.63,2435.432,Daylighting the parameters that I would hope to see.,56,,
280,0.97,2435.432,2440.905,And apologies I would love to circle back with any of you later to dig deeper.,56,,
281,0.97,2440.905,2445.242,Really the parameters are the base functioning of Governanc.,56,,
282,0.97,2445.242,2454.218,I don't think there's a better way of saying what you just said Council president in these circumstances that occur from time to time.,56,,
283,0.97,2454.218,2456.854,But are not regularly used.,56,,
284,0.97,2456.854,2459.19,For the base function of either Council or city government.,56,,
285,0.97,2459.19,2467.698,But not so different than payment of the bills something to that degree.,56,,
286,0.97,2467.698,2479.109,What I am trying to avoid is legislation policy that makes a policy or a law change within the city government that does not have a sponsorship attached to it.,56,,
287,0.97,2479.109,2489.286,That's the problem I'm trying to solve for and I think the parameters I'm looking for is the base function of Governance.,56,,
288,0.97,2489.286,2498.429,"Can I ask a little bit about that, so even in the instance in which there was no sponsors.",57,,
289,0.97,2498.429,2503.801,"The city council still Deliberated, debated, considered, voted and took action on legislation.",57,,
290,0.97,2503.801,2518.449,"So what is the, I want to make sure that, it's clear that no sponsorship doesn't mean that there's going to be no action.",57,,
291,0.97,2518.449,2518.782,No analysis.,57,,
292,0.97,2518.782,2519.383,"No deliberation, no debate.",57,,
293,0.97,2519.383,2531.362,It just literally means that there is not a council member partner or advocate for that legislation on the city council.,57,,
294,0.97,2531.362,2543.574,But that does not mean that the legislation will not receive due analysis especially from our Council central staff.,57,,
295,0.97,2543.574,2545.876,And from the law Department.,57,,
296,0.97,2545.876,2546.243,"Yes, sorry.",58,,
297,0.97,2546.243,2548.512,Is there something.,58,,
298,0.97,2548.512,2551.949,How would you like me to respond?,58,,
299,0.97,2551.949,2555.085,I don't know.,58,,
300,0.97,2555.085,2587.051,"I'm hearing you equate no sponsorship with no process or a or a stalling of legislation I just want to make clear of it Thats that not the effect of the, of the proposed rule change in other words the fact that there is no sponsor.",59,,
301,0.97,2587.051,2594.425,"Does not, does not equate to no process on the bill or a stalling of the bill.",59,,
302,0.97,2594.425,2626.357,"So I guess I'm, I am not understanding your I'm hearing that your concern is potentially around a concern that if there is no sponsor then nothing happens with the bill and therefore there's bad Governance so I'm trying to get a bottom line to get to what you're talking about.",59,,
303,0.97,2626.357,2626.857,Thank you.,60,,
304,0.97,2626.857,2641.639,I think we're speaking around each other and I would be happy to speak to you . to hold accountability to what's contained with that legislation and to hold accountability with our colleagues.,60,,
305,0.97,2641.639,2646.477,Whether or not we generated the legislation at all.,60,,
306,0.97,2646.477,2662.393,Hearing your and director handy's feed back we need to process certain bills and Ordnance for good Governance that people don't want to put their name on.,60,,
307,0.97,2662.393,2673.504,My starting point is I feel it is important for accountability regarding legislation and our colleagues that names are associated with bills.,60,,
308,0.97,2673.504,2679.91,"And so, I think we might be speaking a little bit past each other Council president and chair.",60,,
309,0.97,2679.91,2689.82,I want to put that as my baseline that I think it is important.,60,,
310,0.97,2689.82,2698.629,,61,,
311,0.97,2698.629,2698.996,Okay.,62,,
312,0.97,2698.996,2703.701,Any other questions Council member Strauss.,62,,
313,0.97,2703.701,2705.102,"No, thank you.",63,,
314,0.97,2705.102,2706.437,"Okay, council member Morales.",64,,
315,0.97,2706.437,2706.804,Thank you.,65,,
316,0.97,2706.804,2716.613,I think my question might relate a little bit to what Council member Herbold was talking about.,65,,
317,0.97,2716.613,2730.127,"I just want to make sure that at practice, I have implemented or intended to implemented my Committee is acceptable.",65,,
318,0.97,2730.127,2739.036,"Which is that, for example, Bia is coming before my committee but the council member who's district that's in doesn't sit on my committee.",65,,
319,0.97,2739.036,2752.349,"I have invited them to come and make the presentation not necessarily to vote but to be part of the discussion and present on their, what's happening in their district.",65,,
320,0.97,2752.349,2757.054,Is there anything here that prevents that?,65,,
321,0.97,2757.054,2758.789,As long as they aren't actually voting.,65,,
322,0.97,2758.789,2780.077,"No, the chair of the committee has the power to invite additional members of the Council to attend the committee, the chair has the ability to recognize that, sorry not committee member that Council member for discussion of any item at their committee.",66,,
323,0.97,2780.077,2780.611,Okay.,67,,
324,0.97,2780.611,2787.784,"So that, they could technically have maybe been the sponsor of that legislation.",67,,
325,0.97,2787.784,2792.99,But once it's in my committee they become the author and somebody else is the sponsor and.,67,,
326,0.97,2792.99,2795.926,That's the piece that is also sort of confusing me to be honest.,67,,
327,0.97,2795.926,2801.331,That goes back to this issue of time.,68,,
328,0.97,2801.331,2810.774,So they could table the legislation regarding the Bia in their district.,68,,
329,0.97,2810.774,2816.38,It would get reserved to your Committee.,68,,
330,0.97,2816.38,2840.737,You could invite them to attend they could author that amendment but they would have to recommend that you or another Council member is the sponsor of that item.,68,,
331,0.97,2840.737,2847.544,"Okay, Okay, thank you.",69,,
332,0.97,2847.544,2851.548,Any other questions on the 14?,70,,
333,0.97,2851.548,2858.255,Okay then Council member Herbold I see your hand is still up.,70,,
334,0.97,2858.255,2861.258,I'm assuming that's a hold over.,70,,
335,0.97,2861.258,2861.625,There we go.,70,,
336,0.97,2861.625,2861.825,Okay.,70,,
337,0.97,2861.825,2870.133,And then did want to have the record reflect that we were joined a few moments ago by Council member Peterson as well.,70,,
338,0.97,2870.133,2870.467,Welcome.,70,,
339,0.97,2870.467,2870.667,Okay.,70,,
340,0.97,2870.667,2889.319,"Let's go ahead and if there are no addition questions on the first 14 items, why don't we continue to go through Thepresentation to the next section which have more significant policy questions.",70,,
341,0.97,2889.319,2899.963,If you wouldn't mind pulling that memo up again starting on page four.,71,,
342,0.97,2899.963,2917.514,I appreciate we would discuss them today and if Council members would like to see the change those would need to come forward with as amendments.,71,,
343,0.97,2917.514,2934.464,I am requesting that amendment request come in by Friday at noon to give our team time to draft them and get them posted on the agenda for the public to review for discussion next Wednesday.,71,,
344,0.97,2934.464,2943.874,So the first of two policy issues that the work group discusses is a council meeting schedule.,71,,
345,0.97,2943.874,2946.943,Currently the city council meets as a full Council on Monday.,71,,
346,0.97,2946.943,2955.786,You have a Council briefing at 9:30 in the morning and you take action as a full council at 2:00 P.M.,71,,
347,0.97,2955.786,2957.721,"Standing committees typically follow on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Friday.",71,,
348,0.97,2957.721,2966.663,Thursday is usually reserved as a time for Council members to attend regional committee meetings.,71,,
349,0.97,2966.663,2978.675,The Mondays often result in last minute work over the weekends to draft amendments and two kind of policy concerns over that discussed by the work group.,71,,
350,0.97,2978.675,2981.578,One is health and Sustainability of Council staff.,71,,
351,0.97,2981.578,2990.287,Both Council members and our central staff team and limited time for public review of any amendments before that full council action on Monday.,71,,
352,0.97,2990.287,3004.601,"So the work group, looked at a few different options for alternate days and as putting forth for Council consideration a Tuesday council meeting.",71,,
353,0.97,3004.601,3006.403,There are three alternatives outlined here.,71,,
354,0.97,3006.403,3014.978,"The first would establish both of them, sorry both alternative one and two have Monday mornings with no meetings.",71,,
355,0.97,3014.978,3015.979,A Council briefing at 2:00 P.M.,71,,
356,0.97,3015.979,3020.584,On Monday and a full council meeting on Tuesday.,71,,
357,0.97,3020.584,3025.689,In alternative one the full council would meet on Tuesday afternoon.,71,,
358,0.97,3025.689,3029.926,And alternative would be the full council meets on Tuesday morning.,71,,
359,0.97,3029.926,3053.483,We think both of these options give more of a chance to give that Monday time for any final prep for committee meetings that Monday afternoon briefings as an option to daylight action that is going to come before the Council to set for a day before either the next morning or the next afternoon full council action.,71,,
360,0.97,3053.483,3062.092,"Under both these options, committee meetings would continue on Tuesday, Wednesdays and Fridays for the alternatives where you have a full council meeting.",71,,
361,0.97,3062.092,3072.702,The committee meeting would be in the afternoon and that would be the opposite for an afternoon meeting.,71,,
362,0.97,3072.702,3080.877,The two additional considerations to consider are one where a council meeting would move to Tuesday.,71,,
363,0.97,3080.877,3085.782,"Council members would consider amending the deadline, that deadline is two hours prior to the meeting.",71,,
364,0.97,3085.782,3089.82,You could amend that to be 5:00 on Monday.,71,,
365,0.97,3089.82,3096.893,Again to give additional time for those amendments to be seen and understood before full council action.,71,,
366,0.97,3096.893,3102.899,And then there has been some discussion about where Council briefing fits into this.,71,,
367,0.97,3102.899,3104.968,Should it be weekly.,71,,
368,0.97,3104.968,3107.237,Should it be less frequently.,71,,
369,0.97,3107.237,3111.141,Should it be at the discretion of the Council President.,71,,
370,0.97,3111.141,3123.253,"So happy to, have discussion or take questions on sort of any aspects of moving a council meeting from Monday to Tuesday.",71,,
371,0.97,3123.253,3128.492,Okay let's take a pause on each one of these.,72,,
372,0.97,3128.492,3137.067,Just to make sure we can have a full discussion here.,72,,
373,0.97,3137.067,3140.337,Okay I do see one hand raised.,72,,
374,0.97,3140.337,3149.079,Let's go ahead and call on Council member Herbold.,72,,
375,0.97,3149.079,3150.447,Thank you.,73,,
376,0.97,3150.447,3173.904,As it relates I appreciate you doing so we can see in real life how this kind of change as it relates to Monday meetings would have a charge on standing committee meetings and with consideration of other Renallal regional committees and etc.,73,,
377,0.97,3173.904,3202.199,It might be helpful for the viewing public to talk a little bit about the challenges that are created with a city clerk with a Monday full council meeting because that's not a challenge we want to.,73,,
378,0.97,3202.199,3227.424,"The alternatives that are provided for briefings and full council meetings and Committee meeting times, does this assume one the current number of committee meetings and sorry the current number of committees first of all, and does it consider the current number of meetings the existing number of committees have.",73,,
379,0.97,3227.424,3230.46,"So some committees meet twice monthly, some meet one time a month.",73,,
380,0.97,3230.46,3239.436,Right now we have a particular number of committees and all of this may change in the new year.,73,,
381,0.97,3239.436,3252.882,My understanding is the Kalen Tars that are attached that show alternative one and two are based on the number of committees we have today and how frequently they meet.,74,,
382,0.97,3252.882,3268.531,There currently isn't a Wednesday afternoon or a Friday afternoon Committee on those calendars and so those would likely be the sort of room for expansion if you were to have more committees next year or committees that met more frequently.,74,,
383,0.97,3268.531,3280.176,Our recommendation for the work group would be to not use the Monday morning slot but to use either that Wednesday afternoon or that Friday afternoon slot.,74,,
384,0.97,3280.176,3285.148,City clerk do you have anything to add to that?,74,,
385,0.97,3285.148,3287.35,No I think you covered Esther.,75,,
386,0.97,3287.35,3298.762,These are options that were reviewed with the deputy city clerk and the group.,75,,
387,0.97,3298.762,3305.635,This is something that's workable and doable.,75,,
388,0.97,3305.635,3324.521,I do want to note that the attached show the schematic impact of these proposed changes particularly as it relates to how it impacts staff in terms of preparation.,76,,
389,0.97,3324.521,3339.035,So attachment three also has some of that same information so I would encourage you all to look at those documents as we're looking at these as well.,76,,
390,0.97,3339.035,3339.536,Council member Juarez.,76,,
391,0.97,3339.536,3356.619,Thank you for meeting with us and our staff yesterday for almost and hour and going through this 12 page memo and attachments.,77,,
392,0.97,3356.619,3358.088,I love attachments and charts and memos.,77,,
393,0.97,3358.088,3365.095,We will be going through these and speak more Coherently when we have.,77,,
394,0.97,3365.095,3400.13,"And one thing I would like to bring up is I do agree with you that we need to, since we're in this zoom posture now and looking at a screen and also having more time by not making staff work on Sundays to be prepared for Mondays, I would also be considering giving a third option where we have Council meetings on Tuesdays and hopefully or perhaps have Council briefings every other Monday whether it's 9:30 or 2:00.",77,,
395,0.97,3400.13,3429.092,"And also and I had this talk Withester, Monica and Elizabeth yesterday, my reasoning behind this is because as Council members we have access to so many social media platforms that other doesn't.",77,,
396,0.97,3429.092,3431.094,That we'll be doing the cities business over a screen.,77,,
397,0.97,3431.094,3436.132,I would like to talk and meet with anybody else who has any other comments.,77,,
398,0.97,3436.132,3450.28,"I know Esther is going to help me out on this about offering this third option about, I would like to hear from my colleagues about having Council briefings every other week in which we talk about what we have done.",77,,
399,0.97,3450.28,3465.028,What we're going to do and other issues that actually brief the public instead of having three hour morning meetings sometimes where we hear the same thing again at noon.,77,,
400,0.97,3465.028,3472.035,I'm not trying to be nagging or disdainful of people who want to have the same message over and over.,77,,
401,0.97,3472.035,3484.981,But I want to be cognitive of the effect of being on a computer for seven or eight hours a day is for our health and trying to use our time more efficiently particularly for the viewing public.,77,,
402,0.97,3484.981,3486.85,So we can do the government business as we've done.,77,,
403,0.97,3486.85,3508.404,"And I think I can share this with you as well Council President, I feel bad that some of the newer Council members that were elected never really had an opportunity to sit at Thedias and have the democracy of people coming in and being able to speak at public comment.",77,,
404,0.97,3508.404,3516.045,And doing this by zoom has obviously curtailed this a lot but I think the mental and physical health is important.,77,,
405,0.97,3516.045,3532.128,I don't see any time in the near future when the state or the city is going to lift this occupational position we're in now where we're doing everything over zoom or our teams or whatever.,77,,
406,0.97,3532.128,3534.931,So if there's anyone has any comments about that.,77,,
407,0.97,3534.931,3546.442,Ma'am President I would ask if you could maybe see if has any comments about having Council briefings every other week.,77,,
408,0.97,3546.442,3547.343,Thank you.,77,,
409,0.97,3547.343,3551.781,Yeah thanks Council member Juarez.,78,,
410,0.97,3551.781,3560.99,I will provide some information on this just sort of factual information for people take into consideration as we're having this conversation.,78,,
411,0.97,3560.99,3574.47,And of course want to make sure that others have an opportunity to weigh in on a Biweekly schedule of Council briefings.,78,,
412,0.97,3574.47,3582.412,And I see that Council Memberpederson has his hand raised.,78,,
413,0.97,3582.412,3610.807,"I do want to, having served as the Council president for the last two years, just offer you all the benefit of some additional information that, happens I would say a lot in the back of the house, so we get to see a lot of it but those who don't serve in the role of Council President may not have had the opportunity to see the flow coming in and sort of what's required in terms of Calendaring.",78,,
414,0.97,3610.807,3619.849,So I just would offer a couple of things.,78,,
415,0.97,3619.849,3624.354,"One is that, council briefing is oftentimes the last chance.",78,,
416,0.97,3624.354,3641.537,Particularly for those Council members who don't sit on committees to daylight concerns about legislation that might be subject to final Council action at that next Council meeting.,78,,
417,0.97,3641.537,3642.472,In this case.,78,,
418,0.97,3642.472,3643.272,9:30 A.M.,78,,
419,0.97,3643.272,3658.921,Tends to be the time when many Council members especially those who don't sit at committee bring forward terms that Council is going to act on at 4:00 in the afternoon.,78,,
420,0.97,3658.921,3695.024,"So my worry about eliminating or going to a Biweekly Council member schedule role is that we still will be having weekly full council meetings and sort of how do you create a public process and a consistent Channel, regular channel of communication that is Compliant with the meetings acts on emerging concerns or amendments that a council member may want to bring at a full council meeting.",78,,
421,0.97,3695.024,3696.993,"So there's, there is that challenge.",78,,
422,0.97,3696.993,3712.975,Now I will admit that not every piece of legislation that is listed on every single full council meeting required amendments and is sometimes and no one has additional members to make.,78,,
423,0.97,3712.975,3722.785,"In that instance it could be, it could be that we make Council briefings discretionary and at the discretion of the Council President.",78,,
424,0.97,3722.785,3737.834,"So if we see that the full council agenda is noncontroversial, there's not going to be any amendments.",78,,
425,0.97,3737.834,3741.037,There are Copuntuary items.,78,,
426,0.97,3741.037,3753.516,Then the Council could cancel the briefing regard the fact that we don't expect a slew of last minute amendments from Noncommittee members coming forward.,78,,
427,0.97,3753.516,3761.824,Otherwise I just don't know how to provide the relief valve in compliance.,78,,
428,0.97,3761.824,3763.993,That's one legislation that I would offer.,78,,
429,0.97,3763.993,3771.2,The other thing is Council briefing is typically the space that is offered for executive sessions.,78,,
430,0.97,3771.2,3775.571,Many of which are last minute.,78,,
431,0.97,3775.571,3781.21,Requests by the city attorney's office.,78,,
432,0.97,3781.21,3784.18,They are also an Opportunty for interrelations to make presentations.,78,,
433,0.97,3784.18,3798.427,Again some of these things are predictable but I would say that many of the executive sessions are and can be unpredictable and a little fast and furious.,78,,
434,0.97,3798.427,3828.858,So that's why I am suggesting that if there is an inclination to go to a Biweekly schedule in Staed of making that mandatory we should make that to be at the discretion of the Council based on the consideration a week prior that a Council briefing would be necessary that week.,78,,
435,0.97,3828.858,3838.367,I think that would be realistic about staff constraints and some of the public health concerns that Council member Juarez has flagged.,78,,
436,0.97,3838.367,3851.38,I wanted to offer that as folks are mulling over the process of making Council meetings Biweekly or not.,78,,
437,0.97,3851.38,3851.614,Sorry.,78,,
438,0.97,3851.614,3853.683,A lot of information.,78,,
439,0.97,3853.683,3866.229,We have sample sheets of Howoften we get executive sessions so that it's helpful to you all as Council members as you're thinking about the cadence of the work.,78,,
440,0.97,3866.229,3867.063,Council member Pederson please.,78,,
441,0.97,3867.063,3868.998,Thank you Council President Gonzalez.,79,,
442,0.97,3868.998,3875.705,Thank you for inviting Nonmembers of the committee to this committee really appreciate it.,79,,
443,0.97,3875.705,3876.939,I love this stuff.,79,,
444,0.97,3876.939,3878.407,I love parliamentary procedure.,79,,
445,0.97,3878.407,3882.311,I'm embarrassed that I don't have my 12th edition yet.,79,,
446,0.97,3882.311,3884.413,I need to get that.,79,,
447,0.97,3884.413,3890.419,I know the clerk is going to get on my case for that.,79,,
448,0.97,3890.419,3895.124,So I definitely support moving Council meetings to Tuesdays.,79,,
449,0.97,3895.124,3897.76,"I really appreciate the working group, listen input.",79,,
450,0.97,3897.76,3903.099,I think when Council members worry about a connect directly with each other and talk about the week.,79,,
451,0.97,3903.099,3904.533,What did we do over this weekend?,79,,
452,0.97,3904.533,3908.938,Well I worked all Sunday because I was getting ready for Council briefing and such.,79,,
453,0.97,3908.938,3915.845,So I think that's a really good move in Oakland California they're on Tuesdays and had some experience with that there.,79,,
454,0.97,3915.845,3919.248,Thank you for putting those forward as options.,79,,
455,0.97,3919.248,3922.818,I don't have a strong feeling about the two different versions.,79,,
456,0.97,3922.818,3928.224,But if nobody else puts forward an amendment I would be happy to do that.,79,,
457,0.97,3928.224,3935.498,When the time is right and picking up on the discussion from Council member Juarez.,79,,
458,0.97,3935.498,3946.976,I love the idea of making the Council briefings these Chang from shall to May.,79,,
459,0.97,3946.976,3949.912,At the discretion of the Council may have the briefings.,79,,
460,0.97,3949.912,3959.722,You may end up having it nine or ten times but just changing it from May to shall may be helpful flexibility.,79,,
461,0.97,3959.722,3961.59,Thank you for that Council member Pederson.,80,,
462,0.97,3961.59,3969.498,You mentioned you don't have a preference of whether it's in the morning or afternoon slots on Tuesday but you love the Tuesday move.,80,,
463,0.97,3969.498,3973.302,Did I hear you say that correctly?,80,,
464,0.97,3973.302,3985.648,"Yes, I could see the benefit of having the Council briefing Monday afternoon and the full council meeting Tuesday afternoon.",81,,
465,0.97,3985.648,4002.932,Because I'm worried if you have full council in the morning it might run into the committee meeting where it's easier to Truncate the committee.,81,,
466,0.97,4002.932,4015.478,But I haven't thought through all the.,81,,
467,0.97,4015.478,4034.83,And just noting my interest in making sure we have extra time of looking at potential amendments and I recognize that we have to make sure they're all scheduled around other committee meetings I would prefer to do Thursday but I know there's a time of regional committee meetings.,82,,
468,0.97,4034.83,4057.887,In lieu of Thursday I was looking at seeing if Monday afternoon . I would very much support having a Monday afternoon option as well or around noon.,82,,
469,0.97,4057.887,4061.724,That sounds like a fourth option potentially on Wednesday.,83,,
470,0.97,4061.724,4066.829,What I'm hearing very clearly that folks are on board with not having full Council on Monday.,83,,
471,0.97,4066.829,4069.999,So now we are wrestling with Tuesday or Wednesday.,83,,
472,0.97,4069.999,4070.633,At this point.,83,,
473,0.97,4070.633,4082.011,I do want to offer the clerk's an opportunity to talk about a Wednesday option.,83,,
474,0.97,4082.011,4086.949,We did on our deliberation process consider Wednesday and what a Wednesday would look like.,83,,
475,0.97,4086.949,4092.822,I know the answer of the question I'm asking so I will not answer it for myself.,83,,
476,0.97,4092.822,4107.636,"I will look to the city clerks to provide the answer as to, why Wednesday presented some difficulties.",83,,
477,0.97,4107.636,4116.979,You with go ahead and cover that or we can come back after chatting a little bit more with the city clerks.,84,,
478,0.97,4116.979,4121.05,"Certainly, this is for a Wednesday afternoon council meeting contemplation.",85,,
479,0.97,4121.05,4141.537,I think what I would say first off is the rules committee itself actually looked at multiple dates and multiple times and all of the meetings that take place as we mentioned not just our own committee schedule which again will be reset at the beginning of next year.,85,,
480,0.97,4141.537,4152.214,"But also any sort of regional Committee, also committees that the directors would be pulled if the commissions would be going on at the same time.",85,,
481,0.97,4152.214,4160.456,If those considerations were taken into place to come up with the idea of a potential Tuesday afternoon.,85,,
482,0.97,4160.456,4167.763,That's where that became something that was one of the options that seemed to kind of fit all of the needs.,85,,
483,0.97,4167.763,4173.235,I do not recall anything specific that would hinder a Wednesday afternoon meeting.,85,,
484,0.97,4173.235,4177.339,So I do think that one was still in the running as they may say.,85,,
485,0.97,4177.339,4184.313,And I do think Thursdays there was some concern there just being later in the week and also those regional committees for Thursdays.,85,,
486,0.97,4184.313,4187.283,"So trying to stay away from Mondays, stay away from Thursdays.",85,,
487,0.97,4187.283,4195.658,And then I think Fridays there was some thought that might just be too late in the week to address this type of business.,85,,
488,0.97,4195.658,4198.627,So I would say again Tuesdays and Wednesdays.,85,,
489,0.97,4198.627,4201.197,Tuesday seems to be a preference just because of the flow.,85,,
490,0.97,4201.197,4206.135,And looking ahead to getting items from Committee on to the agenda for next week.,85,,
491,0.97,4206.135,4212.474,I think that's another consideration as how those committees and the work in committees gets on the next week's agenda.,85,,
492,0.97,4212.474,4223.152,So there really is a lot going on to kind of consider how it all works together to keep legislation and keep us being efficient.,85,,
493,0.97,4223.152,4226.755,Hopefully that's what I can offer at this point.,85,,
494,0.97,4226.755,4236.665,Certainly we can contemplate putting together a schedule like we have for Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon and just have a visual representation.,85,,
495,0.97,4236.665,4238.467,I appreciate that.,86,,
496,0.97,4238.467,4241.87,We can certainly generate that fourth option.,86,,
497,0.97,4241.87,4250.746,I would say that originally had considered Wednesday.,87,,
498,0.97,4250.746,4266.462,"In my Recoelection it would make a crunch getting legislation finished, quality controlled and ready for publishing for the Friday city council agenda.",87,,
499,0.97,4266.462,4277.373,So my sense was from the deputy clerks that they felt they might be getting compressed on the end of the time line.,87,,
500,0.97,4277.373,4285.948,Given deadlines for publishing publicly legislation that would be available to members of the public for their review and their comment.,87,,
501,0.97,4285.948,4294.123,If those concerns no longer exist then I would certainly be interested in seeing a schedule for Wednesday afternoon as well.,87,,
502,0.97,4294.123,4308.237,But my recollection of reviewing some of the notes from the staff work group is the deputy city clerks in particular expressed some concerns about getting jammed toward the end of the week.,87,,
503,0.97,4308.237,4316.345,"-Z especially since many of them would still, especially since many of them would still be required to work other committee meetings throughout the week.",87,,
504,0.97,4316.345,4332.494,That's a consideration and I think that's why we landed on to sort of give folks a little bit more wiggle room in terms of the deadlines associated with the location of the Agendas and referral of legislation.,87,,
505,0.97,4332.494,4334.096,"Yes, I understand the interest for Wednesday as well.",88,,
506,0.97,4334.096,4342.337,We can flush it out a little bit more and confirm what you're sharing and what you've heard from our feed back from our staff feed back.,88,,
507,0.97,4342.337,4344.239,But we can dig a little deeper.,88,,
508,0.97,4344.239,4348.143,Great.,89,,
509,0.97,4348.143,4351.613,And provide the pros and Cons.,90,,
510,0.97,4351.613,4351.98,Okay.,91,,
511,0.97,4351.98,4355.517,Director handy any sort of feed back from the central staff.,91,,
512,0.97,4355.517,4369.765,I think there are fewer but I think there are a couple of regional committees that meet on that Wednesday afternoon slot so I think we can look at that option.,92,,
513,0.97,4369.765,4372.334,We want to look at that Wednesday morning.,92,,
514,0.97,4372.334,4393.122,I think from our perspective of the pace of moving kind of into full committee swing before full council there's some trade off there of kind of the capacity that's availability from staff to preferably full council.,92,,
515,0.97,4393.122,4394.857,"Council member Strauss, please.",93,,
516,0.97,4394.857,4396.759,"Thank you Council President, chair, committee.",94,,
517,0.97,4396.759,4398.494,Just signaling I will be honest.,94,,
518,0.97,4398.494,4405.234,I originally thought that Tuesday in the afternoon would be best for full council after reading this memo.,94,,
519,0.97,4405.234,4418.013,Well done on the memo I'm thinking 9:30 in the morning on Tuesday would be best.,94,,
520,0.97,4418.013,4423.152,Just signaling my preference.,94,,
521,0.97,4423.152,4425.654,Associating Council briefing with full council meetings.,94,,
522,0.97,4425.654,4428.757,"If we have full Council, we can have Council briefing.",94,,
523,0.97,4428.757,4432.361,"If we don't have full Council, we don't have Council briefing.",94,,
524,0.97,4432.361,4444.807,I think I'm hearing you say that you want Council briefings to be mandatory every week or still discretionary.,95,,
525,0.97,4444.807,4448.577,The current practice is discretionary.,96,,
526,0.97,4448.577,4450.846,The current practice is mandatory.,97,,
527,0.97,4450.846,4451.18,Mandatory.,98,,
528,0.97,4451.18,4455.584,I would lean toward mandatory because then we can always not schedule them.,98,,
529,0.97,4455.584,4457.619,We can suspend the rules and not have one.,98,,
530,0.97,4457.619,4481.443,"For me, let me get down to the problem that I'm trying to solve for here which I think I heard you chair state earlier which is if we have a full council meeting it is important to have a full council meeting associated with that Council in which the legislation is discussed will have the opportunity to provide feed back before entering into that meeting.",98,,
531,0.97,4481.443,4492.521,I think that is an important consideration for folks to consider as we're mulling about a potential amendment in this area.,99,,
532,0.97,4492.521,4501.53,My solution to that was to suggest that Council briefings could be at the discretion of the Council President.,99,,
533,0.97,4501.53,4517.779,"Such that if we have a very slow, slow full council meeting Ie nothing controversial, Noamendments you know, everything simple.",99,,
534,0.97,4517.779,4528.724,Then the Council President would make a determination on Friday to make Council briefings so we're having the best use of our time and the best use of staff time.,99,,
535,0.97,4528.724,4533.462,"So that would, could in practice turn out to be Biweekly.",99,,
536,0.97,4533.462,4539.668,Council briefings or it could in practice turn out to be exactly like it is now.,99,,
537,0.97,4539.668,4558.487,"But I think what we're hearing from, from the discussion right now is there's some interest in allowing for that discretion to be vested in the next Council President to allow the next Council President to make that call if and when appropriate.",99,,
538,0.97,4558.487,4561.256,Well said Council President.,100,,
539,0.97,4561.256,4572.301,I look at during this last budget season you canceled one of the last budget meetings because there was nothing before us associated Council briefing should be canceled as well.,100,,
540,0.97,4572.301,4574.002,You did a good job.,100,,
541,0.97,4574.002,4574.369,Nothing there.,100,,
542,0.97,4574.369,4581.91,During budget season there's a fair amount of Council briefings that we just don't have anything to report.,100,,
543,0.97,4581.91,4587.115,I'm signaling my support O canceling the meetings.,100,,
544,0.97,4587.115,4589.952,Nothing says love than another meeting.,100,,
545,0.97,4589.952,4590.452,That's true.,101,,
546,0.97,4590.452,4593.922,There's also extra love if it's a meeting about the meeting.,101,,
547,0.97,4593.922,4595.123,Here we are.,102,,
548,0.97,4595.123,4598.427,Here we are.,103,,
549,0.97,4598.427,4602.497,Thank you Council President.,103,,
550,0.97,4602.497,4604.8,"Yeah, of course.",104,,
551,0.97,4604.8,4611.44,"Any other comments, questions, concerns, preferences for options that Council members would like to express.",104,,
552,0.97,4611.44,4629.725,I know Council member Juarez in particular Cued up the Biweekly question but do want to make sure that in general folks have the opportunity to Opine as it relates to the frequency and date that the Council will do its business.,104,,
553,0.97,4629.725,4630.459,Council member Herbold please.,104,,
554,0.97,4630.459,4655.917,"Just want to, before we Gettoo excited about Wednesday afternoon, I want to thank director handy for Referencing the point that they're not as frequent but there are at least three that I'm aware of regional committees that meet Wednesday afternoon.",105,,
555,0.97,4655.917,4656.685,"Opc, regional committee and nine.",105,,
556,0.97,4656.685,4666.361,They are not every other week but there's still a consideration because we're expected to represent the city on those bodies.,105,,
557,0.97,4666.361,4694.089,And then as it relates to this question around regional committees generally I'm wondering whether or not we've checked in with King County to see whether or not they too are considering any changes that we should be aware of in sort of doing the game theory around impacts of potential changes that we're considering.,105,,
558,0.97,4694.089,4722.217,"And Lastly, I'm supportive of the as it relates to the Council briefings, potential change and shifting us out to may I think that seems like an elegant solution that accomplishes the goals that I heard from members today.",105,,
559,0.97,4722.217,4722.951,And I appreciate that.,105,,
560,0.97,4722.951,4724.186,Thank you.,106,,
561,0.97,4724.186,4729.858,And I know King County meets Tuesdays at 2:00.,106,,
562,0.97,4729.858,4733.095,Just point of information there.,106,,
563,0.97,4733.095,4750.045,But do want to offer anybody from the staff work group if they have any additional information related to what King County might or may not be considering in terms of their,106,,
564,0.97,4750.045,4753.315,We have not reached out to them.,107,,
565,0.97,4753.315,4762.023,Esther I'm not sure if you've had any exchange with your colleagues at King County that I may be unaware of.,107,,
566,0.97,4762.023,4763.325,We have not.,108,,
567,0.97,4763.325,4770.232,It was originally actually a reason we ruled out Tuesday afternoon.,108,,
568,0.97,4770.232,4793.121,"But then, decided that we thought that there, was enough, enough jurisdictions that have similar meeting times that it would not be in conflict and, but happy to have a more formal conversation with the county as you make a final kind of decision on this is helpful.",108,,
569,0.97,4793.121,4795.223,Thanks so much.,109,,
570,0.97,4795.223,4795.757,Council member Morales.,109,,
571,0.97,4795.757,4796.124,Thank you.,110,,
572,0.97,4796.124,4803.098,I want to echo first of all what Council member Herbold just said.,110,,
573,0.97,4803.098,4809.571,I was late to this meeting because I had my own Psrc development district board meeting on Wednesday.,110,,
574,0.97,4809.571,4814.442,And we will only meet five times a year but it's on a Wednesday afternoon.,110,,
575,0.97,4814.442,4821.583,And it is an important issue to make sure we're all participating in those conversations.,110,,
576,0.97,4821.583,4832.961,And then the other thing I wanted to signal my support for meeting on having Monday briefing and then Tuesday afternoon meetings.,110,,
577,0.97,4832.961,4853.949,"I just, I do feel like there's not enough time if we have a briefing in the afternoon and then meet Tuesday morning for us to review amendments and really do diligence if there's something that comes up during briefings before a Monday, Tuesday morning meeting.",110,,
578,0.97,4853.949,4861.056,So just throwing my hat into the Tuesday afternoon camp.,110,,
579,0.97,4861.056,4864.693,Thank you so much Council member Morales.,111,,
580,0.97,4864.693,4865.06,Director handy.,111,,
581,0.97,4865.06,4866.461,I just wanted to clarify.,112,,
582,0.97,4866.461,4869.197,The King County meets at 2:00 P.M.,112,,
583,0.97,4869.197,4869.531,On Tuesdays.,112,,
584,0.97,4869.531,4871.967,It's not a drastic difference but a little bit of staggering.,112,,
585,0.97,4871.967,4879.207,We talked about that in terms of if the public is Commenting it could do both in one day and track legislation.,112,,
586,0.97,4879.207,4888.149,So just a slight update to what I said previously.,112,,
587,0.97,4888.149,4889.084,Thank you so much.,113,,
588,0.97,4889.084,4897.492,Okay I want to thank you all for the robust conversation on that particular option.,113,,
589,0.97,4897.492,4911.64,I think we have some sense of where folks want to head and Council member Juarez I was planning to bringing forward an amendment on that happy to work on that together.,113,,
590,0.97,4911.64,4923.151,Okay great so our offices will connect and we'll make sure to advance something together that seems to be reflective of what I think we heard the collective will was.,113,,
591,0.97,4923.151,4930.158,What I heard the collective will was is that Council briefings should go from a shall to a May.,113,,
592,0.97,4930.158,4950.812,"And then we've got a little bit of negotiation to do, or we're thinking to do about a Tuesday afternoon full council versus a Wednesday morning full council meeting.",113,,
593,0.97,4950.812,4965.894,More to come on that but our offices will work together on advancing something that might be acceptable to a majority of the Council.,113,,
594,0.97,4965.894,4968.663,Okay let's move to the next one.,113,,
595,0.97,4968.663,4979.841,Okay one more issue discussed by the committee again not included in the resolution but have some options for your discussion here.,114,,
596,0.97,4979.841,4984.479,Regards is regarding the electronic participation of Council members.,114,,
597,0.97,4984.479,4990.385,Particularly at regular committee and full council meetings.,114,,
598,0.97,4990.385,4994.622,The rules as they currently stand limit electronic participation when we're not in a pandemic.,114,,
599,0.97,4994.622,5006.334,I will start by saying there are special rules in place right now that is enabling full Electroni participation.,114,,
600,0.97,5006.334,5019.814,"Outside of that emergency a council member who may be granted a leave of absence for a personal situation that includes family medical leave, pay parental leave or pay family care leave.",114,,
601,0.97,5019.814,5027.255,"In those circumstances, they may participate E electronically at a regular meeting, a special meeting or emergency meeting.",114,,
602,0.97,5027.255,5036.931,Those are the only circumstances currently provided in the rules under which a council member could participate electronically at a regular meeting.,114,,
603,0.97,5036.931,5047.342,In the case of a special committee meeting a vote of a majority of the Council can also allow a council member to participate electronically excuse me.,114,,
604,0.97,5047.342,5059.054,And the thinking here is sometimes a special committee meeting is called on short notice or under special circumstances.,114,,
605,0.97,5059.054,5082.811,"There are slightly Differentprovisions for a special meeting and for an emergency meeting if it is not practical for Council members to come together because of a natural disaster, a council member could join electronically.",114,,
606,0.97,5082.811,5087.449,You all may want to consider amending the rules around electronic participation.,114,,
607,0.97,5087.449,5093.021,A couple of options we have Layed out here for your consideration.,114,,
608,0.97,5093.021,5106.134,The first is to amend the Council rules to make Council member participation always allowable which is the same as an emergency.,114,,
609,0.97,5106.134,5109.104,And granted at the discretion of the chair.,114,,
610,0.97,5109.104,5118.546,Add more flexible to the rules but have it be the Council President or committee chair that is ultimately sort of making a decision about how those committees are run.,114,,
611,0.97,5118.546,5138.132,Or you could make no change and you know choose to Revisit these policies further in the future when you have a better sense of what a hybrid or return to in person looks like for the city council.,114,,
612,0.97,5138.132,5144.806,"Great, thank you director handy.",115,,
613,0.97,5144.806,5145.006,Okay.,115,,
614,0.97,5145.006,5147.775,Let's open it up for conversation here.,115,,
615,0.97,5147.775,5158.186,"I want to signal that, I'm supportive of option a which would amend the Council rules to make the council member electronic participation always allowable.",115,,
616,0.97,5158.186,5196.124,And sort of the refrain that keeps running through my head is I consider this particular issue is times are changing and they continue to change and evolve and I think that allowing Council members to continue to participate electronically is a sort of common sense approach to how in office work has evolved not just for government but also for the private sector and I think it's important for us to reflect that in our workplace strategies.,115,,
617,0.97,5196.124,5206.334,This doesn't prevent people from coming into work or having a hybrid approach and I think that that is healthy for us to continue to do our business.,115,,
618,0.97,5206.334,5212.74,I would say that Council chambers is actively being Retrofitted to allow for a hybrid model.,115,,
619,0.97,5212.74,5219.948,Both for public comment and for Council member participation.,115,,
620,0.97,5219.948,5228.79,In terms of Logistically we should be able to prepare and adapt if this rule were adopted and passed by Council.,115,,
621,0.97,5228.79,5237.832,I think it's a modernization of how we expect people to show up at the workplace and I would also acknowledge that there are many Council members.,115,,
622,0.97,5237.832,5259.153,There are many Council members that are either Immuno compromised themselves or have family members that are Immuno compromised and this could be a rule change that allows for those Council members to make personal choices about the Amendof exposure they're willing to under take as they're engaging in these public forums.,115,,
623,0.97,5259.153,5271.599,Nothing about this rule means that people won't be accessible or that they aren't engages in good faith and Proactivity in their role as Council members.,115,,
624,0.97,5271.599,5283.511,"So I would encourage us to consider option a as a way to be reflective as how people are showing up in offices, work spaces currently.",115,,
625,0.97,5283.511,5296.324,I think that is going to go well into the future as well.,115,,
626,0.97,5296.324,5301.329,,116,,
627,0.97,5301.329,5315.91,Any other Council members have recommendations.,117,,
628,0.97,5315.91,5318.713,I think our normal is changing.,118,,
629,0.97,5318.713,5326.22,I'm interested in more flexible than is currently provided for remote participation.,118,,
630,0.97,5326.22,5327.255,I'm interested in a hybrid approach.,118,,
631,0.97,5327.255,5345.139,"I don't, I think leaving it up to the chair to determine what the exceptions are, may not meet the objective of creating more flexible.",118,,
632,0.97,5345.139,5362.457,But I'm wondering whether or not we as a body could add more flexibility in a way that still meets that goal but also creates a sort of common expectation for one another.,118,,
633,0.97,5362.457,5378.306,"So I'm interested in sort of, not to Overuse the word hybrid but a hybrid between options a and B.",118,,
634,0.97,5378.306,5384.946,Okay.,119,,
635,0.97,5384.946,5399.127,Any thoughts from the staff work group on what a hybrid between a and B could look like?,119,,
636,0.97,5399.127,5404.065,From my perspective there would be some parameters.,120,,
637,0.97,5404.065,5406.434,Possibly advanced notice.,120,,
638,0.97,5406.434,5412.707,Always is kind of a big word.,120,,
639,0.97,5412.707,5420.815,But some parameters that could be around that always.,120,,
640,0.97,5420.815,5422.45,So that preparation is in order.,120,,
641,0.97,5422.45,5434.629,"Advance notice I would say so that both Seattle Channel, both our Tech team and obviously our city clerks know if they're going to be working in the upcoming week.",120,,
642,0.97,5434.629,5436.364,It won't all be remote today.,120,,
643,0.97,5436.364,5442.17,But I think advance notice is a good example of trying to think of others.,120,,
644,0.97,5442.17,5451.112,Esther or Liz if there's other thoughts in terms of a hybrid version of a & amp; B?,120,,
645,0.97,5451.112,5462.723,I will just add that Council member her bold to your comment about a pair of shared expectations.,121,,
646,0.97,5462.723,5464.292,Right now there's Criteri to paid family leave.,121,,
647,0.97,5464.292,5479.407,You could add if out of town or health concern you all could decide as a body like what are the expectations around when you would Prioritize being in person and when you would allow electronic participation.,121,,
648,0.97,5479.407,5489.517,We could add a Clauser to that like the current provision of family leave Enablesparticipation.,121,,
649,0.97,5489.517,5491.285,Some of that may be harder to verify etc.,121,,
650,0.97,5491.285,5501.729,But it would be in the spirit of when we're having a grievance of when we're going to be in person or not.,121,,
651,0.97,5501.729,5517.245,That's the spirit of I'm speaking here it's not to minimize flexibility but just like the Council rules do inherently for us.,122,,
652,0.97,5517.245,5527.521,"They are about creating our shared comment expectations that it's not about Verifying, but it's about us all sort of holding ourselves accountable to what we agree to.",122,,
653,0.97,5527.521,5541.536,"Yeah and it supports the structure of the meeting, the Facilitation of the meeting process, before, during and after, so.",123,,
654,0.97,5541.536,5550.444,I generally trust and know from experience of working with all of you that you all show up in good faith and are doing hard work all the time.,124,,
655,0.97,5550.444,5559.587,"And so for me this is really about how to we create a, I think instead of saying flexibility is more predictability.",124,,
656,0.97,5559.587,5574.268,We are sort of the face of the Council but behind us are a lot of folks that are doing really important back of the house work to facilitate our ability to do our community work and meetings and otherwise.,124,,
657,0.97,5574.268,5601.329,"For purpose of creating increase predictability for staffing resources and their expectations around what they need to do to prepare, I think it's important for us to identify how we can create greater predictability in the environment that we're currently being asked to work in and that I think as Council member Herbold mentioned is not going to end any time soon.",124,,
658,0.97,5601.329,5613.808,I do think that puts me in the space of leaning.,124,,
659,0.97,5613.808,5626.854,So we're not engaged in a permission based frame work for elected officials but more of a how do we acknowledge that people need flexibility on whatever our personal needs are or medical needs might be.,124,,
660,0.97,5626.854,5638.733,And Secondly how do we do that in a way that will increase predictability for legislative staff.,124,,
661,0.97,5638.733,5646.774,We're going to be necessary for a Factuation of Governance.,124,,
662,0.97,5646.774,5670.498,Maybe what we require is every quarter or every month the specific Council member must designate whether must disclose publicly and to the city whether they will conduct their city business remotely or in person so that we can have proper planning of resources at the legislative Department.,124,,
663,0.97,5670.498,5681.575,I don't have a strong feeling about sort of whether it's at the beginning of the month or for an entire quarter.,124,,
664,0.97,5681.575,5693.487,But something for us to consider that might be a solution to the concerns yourself expressing Council member Herbold.,124,,
665,0.97,5693.487,5699.226,All right looks like I don't see any other hands raised.,124,,
666,0.97,5699.226,5700.728,Anything else on that one?,124,,
667,0.97,5700.728,5702.163,"All right, let's keep going through.",124,,
668,0.97,5702.163,5710.905,Because I know we're going to start losing some folks.,124,,
669,0.97,5710.905,5714.075,This next section we'll get through really quick.,125,,
670,0.97,5714.075,5733.594,We just wanted to highlight there are six ideas that were suggested by Council members that the work group discussed but chose not to advance in the resolution if Council members would like to any of these could be drafted and moved into the amendments.,125,,
671,0.97,5733.594,5741.702,Those ideas including Allowingabstentions of resolutions at full council meetings.,125,,
672,0.97,5741.702,5742.103,Amendment delays.,125,,
673,0.97,5742.103,5761.355,"Reconsidering the roles of committees so if a committee did not, if a bill does not receive a majority support in the committee it does not get advanced to full council.",125,,
674,0.97,5761.355,5778.305,"Recess, adding language that when multiple Council members speaks at the same time or when a council member speaks without the permission, their Audio source could be muted.",125,,
675,0.97,5778.305,5792.119,"And where legislation is referred to, specifically that the Council President will consider the preference of the committee chair in when and where that bill gets referred.",125,,
676,0.97,5792.119,5802.93,So happy to take questions on any of these or hear if there are any other amendments or ideas that Council members are looking to move.,125,,
677,0.97,5802.93,5805.833,Council member Strauss I see your hand is raised.,126,,
678,0.97,5805.833,5810.304,"Thank you Council President, chair of the committee.",127,,
679,0.97,5810.304,5813.641,I have a number of my proposals that did not move forward.,127,,
680,0.97,5813.641,5828.556,Either this would be a good opportunity for you to share with me why this was not contained within this memo or contained within this draft or if you need to meet with me separately in considering the time for other Council members and I know that we're about to start losing folks.,127,,
681,0.97,5828.556,5831.158,So happy to meet with you to the side.,127,,
682,0.97,5831.158,5838.599,I see that some of my ideas were Miss interpreted or we had some sort of miscommunication.,127,,
683,0.97,5838.599,5839.767,So it's all an Iconic.,127,,
684,0.97,5839.767,5849.143,If you could keep that on the screen.,127,,
685,0.97,5849.143,5850.01,That would be helpful.,127,,
686,0.97,5850.01,5850.311,Thank you.,127,,
687,0.97,5850.311,5854.548,"I'm, Yeah I'm happy if there are any misinterpreted.",128,,
688,0.97,5854.548,5869.263,I would say by large most of these felt like substantive policy changes so if there is many of our first 14 were more technical in nature.,128,,
689,0.97,5869.263,5890.618,"We tackled the two in the section above where there seemed to be multiple Council members raised issues, not intending to say they're bad ideas but they're all substantive policy discussions and Council members who have interest.",128,,
690,0.97,5890.618,5892.453,Happy to tackle them.,128,,
691,0.97,5892.453,5900.06,I would say there are a couple around kind of time limits and the one around being out of order.,128,,
692,0.97,5900.06,5910.204,There are multiple rules that those touch so if we want to tackle one we might want to broaden the discussion to include a couple of other items that touch them.,128,,
693,0.97,5910.204,5920.414,That's really helpful so I should not read these as items you do not support these are items that you are bringing forward if we were to discuss them.,129,,
694,0.97,5920.414,5926.453,Group members do you have any different take on that.,130,,
695,0.97,5926.453,5930.791,"No, I think you hit it.",131,,
696,0.97,5930.791,5933.127,Esther yes.,131,,
697,0.97,5933.127,5939.833,I think this warranted discussion and dialogue Withidiscussions within members.,131,,
698,0.97,5939.833,5944.271,Those are items that everything has presented in.,131,,
699,0.97,5944.271,5949.81,But these weren't really further discussions because these weren't further understanding that Council would like to amend specifically.,131,,
700,0.97,5949.81,5954.348,Maybe if we can Scroll back up to number one.,132,,
701,0.97,5954.348,5961.188,I can just provide you my feed back in where I think there was confusion.,132,,
702,0.97,5961.188,5963.524,Allowing Abstentions I'm fine with this one.,132,,
703,0.97,5963.524,5969.83,"Number two, amending the rules of debate to establish a time limit such as two to three minutes per Council member on a single topic.",132,,
704,0.97,5969.83,5977.037,I think that this is a bit of a blunt description for what I was hoping to have a dynamic set of rules.,132,,
705,0.97,5977.037,5982.81,So that if you have and it's not so different than public comment.,132,,
706,0.97,5982.81,5989.783,If we are asking residents of city of Seattle to keep their comments to bills for two minutes.,132,,
707,0.97,5989.783,5998.492,We as Council members may need to speak for a little bit more than two minutes we should still be able to summarize what we're saying within five minutes.,132,,
708,0.97,5998.492,6014.441,Having the ability to respond to other Council members who have problems or you know having those dynamic rules of debate will assist us in being able to have a cohesive and clear conversation in the public.,132,,
709,0.97,6014.441,6019.747,This is an amendment that I will be bringing.,132,,
710,0.97,6019.747,6023.217,Number three reconsider the rules of Committee in advancing legislation.,132,,
711,0.97,6023.217,6029.223,Such that if an item of legislation does not receive the majority support in the committee it is not taking up at full council.,132,,
712,0.97,6029.223,6042.469,Currently it is my understanding that a bill that receives a majority opposition vote in a minority support vote still advances out of the committee.,132,,
713,0.97,6042.469,6046.673,This challenges my understanding of what then the committee is made for.,132,,
714,0.97,6046.673,6048.776,Other than just a simple discussion.,132,,
715,0.97,6048.776,6064.458,"If this is a, situation where the majority of the committee does not believe that it is best for the legislation to advance, I think that the legislation needs to remain in committee until it is ready for full council.",132,,
716,0.97,6064.458,6071.165,"Number four adding another recess in April, this entire paragraph I would say is flipped.",132,,
717,0.97,6071.165,6076.804,The most important part of this is establishing our sequence of work.,132,,
718,0.97,6076.804,6079.339,Least important is adding a recess in April.,132,,
719,0.97,6079.339,6081.875,It could be helpful.,132,,
720,0.97,6081.875,6083.51,I'm kind of Agnostic on the recess aspect.,132,,
721,0.97,6083.51,6087.548,I'm going to take just a second to pause.,132,,
722,0.97,6087.548,6092.886,So that Council members and colleagues you can hear what I'm saying.,132,,
723,0.97,6092.886,6100.327,"Because this is a, the description in number four does not do my proposal justice.",132,,
724,0.97,6100.327,6103.13,"And I'm not, there's no fault being prescribed here.",132,,
725,0.97,6103.13,6104.832,Just a lot going on.,132,,
726,0.97,6104.832,6122.349,What I have noticed working here at Council is that we do not have we spread ourselves too thin at both committee and full Council to a degree that we're not able to review in committee legislation to the degree that we need to.,132,,
727,0.97,6122.349,6139.967,"And then when that legislation leaves the committee we do not have the time at full Council to Digest, understand and have a well founded position at times.",132,,
728,0.97,6139.967,6150.277,"The way the Legislature, the state Legislature solves for this is that during the legislative session there's a period of time at the beginning of the session to work at committee.",132,,
729,0.97,6150.277,6160.12,If the bill is not worked out of by a date certain and moved to the full council agenda or at that point to the rules committee.,132,,
730,0.97,6160.12,6170.397,Or to the the legislative for then the bill dies for that session.,132,,
731,0.97,6170.397,6173.767,So that when the Legislature is for folks to consider out of passage.,132,,
732,0.97,6173.767,6180.107,"This would allow for, you can think of it much like a budget session.",132,,
733,0.97,6180.107,6192.486,Where the budget session allows for us to make special meetings to take up business that is time sensitive such a this last budget season we had a contract Rezone that had to be passed.,132,,
734,0.97,6192.486,6215.642,"This proposal that I'm going to bring forward will set up a legislative cycle for us to better spend our time to investigate, analyze and understand the legislation before us by setting up a time just for committee so that we're not spending necessarily time in Council briefing or full council unnecessarily.",132,,
735,0.97,6215.642,6223.083,And then after date certain those bills will be transferred to the full council where we will then have a serious of full council meetings.,132,,
736,0.97,6223.083,6240.3,Not so different than budget where we would be able to have multiple meetings to better understand the legislation before us.,132,,
737,0.97,6240.3,6241.301,Speaking with Council member Herbold today.,132,,
738,0.97,6241.301,6245.872,Council member Herbold had different decisions.,132,,
739,0.97,6245.872,6255.215,The way schedule was set up we did not at full council have the time to have a full discussion.,132,,
740,0.97,6255.215,6262.856,It led to us having multiple meetings on this bill any way.,132,,
741,0.97,6262.856,6266.893,My proposal is to have the same period of time.,132,,
742,0.97,6266.893,6268.662,Let's call it a month.,132,,
743,0.97,6268.662,6269.129,To flush this out.,132,,
744,0.97,6269.129,6270.664,A month for committee.,132,,
745,0.97,6270.664,6279.806,Half month or full month for full council then we restart Thecycle again.,132,,
746,0.97,6279.806,6290.684,"In this, in item number four the example of session one would last from January to April.",132,,
747,0.97,6290.684,6292.386,Session two may through August recess.,132,,
748,0.97,6292.386,6295.455,With a quick session for tidying up before we go to budget.,132,,
749,0.97,6295.455,6300.761,Then the budget session and much what we're doing right now is clean up right before the end of the year.,132,,
750,0.97,6300.761,6310.771,That was a lot and it was not included in this memo so I will take a moment to take questions.,132,,
751,0.97,6310.771,6315.742,"I would say, I am supportive of item number five.",132,,
752,0.97,6315.742,6322.549,And have not formed an opinion on number six.,132,,
753,0.97,6322.549,6329.022,Thank you chair and Council President.,132,,
754,0.97,6329.022,6330.323,Thanks so much.,133,,
755,0.97,6330.323,6333.093,Okay any other comments or questions.,133,,
756,0.97,6333.093,6343.103,"Again these are items that the work group decided to not, not advance.",133,,
757,0.97,6343.103,6348.442,"And so, that doesn't mean that these items are Council members have the option to bring forward amendments.",133,,
758,0.97,6348.442,6353.947,Again for those of you who are not members of the committee.,133,,
759,0.97,6353.947,6367.394,"Happy to in the spirit of open discussion and conversation I'm happy to, sponsor your amendments if you are looking to be an author to a particular amendment.",133,,
760,0.97,6367.394,6384.244,Because we do want to make sure we have a full discussion and debate on these issues on that I would like to extend that offer to those of you who are not committee members but are in attendance today.,133,,
761,0.97,6384.244,6386.546,"Council member Herbold, please.",133,,
762,0.97,6386.546,6392.786,Thank you.,134,,
763,0.97,6392.786,6394.955,To the recommendation from Council member Strauss.,134,,
764,0.97,6394.955,6405.031,"It's a very interesting, novel concept as it relates to a municipal legislative body to my awareness.",134,,
765,0.97,6405.031,6412.739,And as he mentioned we did discuss this earlier today.,134,,
766,0.97,6412.739,6423.884,I would be interested to know how we might accommodate the continuum of what is time sensitive legislation.,134,,
767,0.97,6423.884,6427.654,And there are many different types of time sensitive legislation.,134,,
768,0.97,6427.654,6431.858,There's the type of legislation that we need to vote on every week right.,134,,
769,0.97,6431.858,6442.869,"And then there are, there are time sensitive bills that are associated with need to act.",134,,
770,0.97,6442.869,6444.404,Because of other external forces.,134,,
771,0.97,6444.404,6465.492,"And I just, I would be interested to understand a little bit more about how we could accommodate that continuum of time sensitive action on behalf of the full council.",134,,
772,0.97,6465.492,6469.796,And create and interested about a proposal.,134,,
773,0.97,6469.796,6475.235,Wanting to speak to items five and six.,134,,
774,0.97,6475.235,6481.708,Item five for me came up recently and there may be.,134,,
775,0.97,6481.708,6488.281,I appreciate the team meeting me and going over the rules that they were putting forward.,134,,
776,0.97,6488.281,6510.203,"One piece I haven't gotten clarity about though, relates to my request on item five for me this came up when there was a suggestion where a council member was being identified as out of order by the chair.",134,,
777,0.97,6510.203,6533.059,"And that individual continued talking and the chair stated that the intent if the activity continued, that the chair would request that the clerk turn off the Mic and the response from the individual who was being called out of order was that that was not permitted.",134,,
778,0.97,6533.059,6552.913,So my question really as it relates to this is what are the permitted tools for the chair to utilize when someone is out of order?,134,,
779,0.97,6552.913,6576.069,"I think that's a good question, but I think also more importantly what are the tools available for the chair when the chair has determined that a member is out of order but refuses to comply with the consequences of being found out of order in other words continues to exhibit the out Oforder behavior.",135,,
780,0.97,6576.069,6579.205,Correct.,136,,
781,0.97,6579.205,6579.94,That was my intent.,136,,
782,0.97,6579.94,6587.747,The compliance is not somebody be out of order but the compliance component.,137,,
783,0.97,6587.747,6591.484,Correct.,138,,
784,0.97,6591.484,6593.92,Anything in the existing rules that can address this.,138,,
785,0.97,6593.92,6601.127,I'm not particularly well versed if those rules so I was going to ask Curt Simmons or Adkinson.,139,,
786,0.97,6601.127,6605.532,Do you know those off the tip of your tongue.,139,,
787,0.97,6605.532,6609.636,I should and I don't have those right in front of me.,140,,
788,0.97,6609.636,6613.44,Liz do you have any of those in front of you in the documentation.,140,,
789,0.97,6613.44,6618.578,I think we would have to review our points of order and how they're brought up specifically.,141,,
790,0.97,6618.578,6620.914,It's very specific when you can raise the point of order.,141,,
791,0.97,6620.914,6627.12,Who can raise the point of order and who would decide on the point of order.,141,,
792,0.97,6627.12,6645.472,I believe again the point of what happens when someone continues to not be A. here's how this process would move forward.,141,,
793,0.97,6645.472,6648.775,I would make just one notice here.,141,,
794,0.97,6648.775,6672.399,As you are considering how you could address this issue in the rules themselves perhaps with an amendment too is the idea about the Audio source and contemplating again hybrid situation so not just our virtual meetings but also when we're back in in person and the Muting of an Audio source versus some other sort of compliance issue.,141,,
795,0.97,6672.399,6682.442,"So definitely thinking ahead to the future when we get back into some sort of all in person, hybrid option.",141,,
796,0.97,6682.442,6684.177,How do you want to maintain these.,141,,
797,0.97,6684.177,6708.134,In the end I do believe this is where we thought some of these items would be great to have further discussion because they do flow together as far as how you want to proceed in your meetings with debate and also when you do have these out of order times how do you want to handle them and what tools can we build into the rules for you to address them appropriately.,141,,
798,0.97,6708.134,6724.951,"This is something that we could, the working group can you know, meet with our full working group and bring these back and just kind of really focus on more of that tool kit.",142,,
799,0.97,6724.951,6725.251,Or that.,142,,
800,0.97,6725.251,6726.219,Graduated process if it's needed.,142,,
801,0.97,6726.219,6733.66,But I know this has been brought forward in the past and I'm not sure that we've really addressed it sufficiently.,142,,
802,0.97,6733.66,6739.866,In preparing the Council members for these situations.,142,,
803,0.97,6739.866,6743.336,Thank you just as a point of clarification or explanation.,143,,
804,0.97,6743.336,6756.549,The reason why I propose what I did is there is a process for determining that a member of the public Testifying is out of order.,143,,
805,0.97,6756.549,6769.762,"And there is a consequence if that person continues to fail to comply and the consequence is turning off, or asking the clerk to turn off the Audio.",143,,
806,0.97,6769.762,6780.44,That creates a situation as deputy clerk Adkinson mentions where you could have somebody still standing at the Mic talking even though the Mic is turned off.,143,,
807,0.97,6780.44,6790.016,This is an imperfect tool now and it would be an imperfect tool moving forward but I wanted to start the conversation some where on this.,143,,
808,0.97,6790.016,6793.82,We appreciate that.,144,,
809,0.97,6793.82,6810.436,And yes that is a progressive process and one where we can involve and come together and develop some tools and determine whether or not Maybe the tool is appropriate for the Council rules or less formal.,144,,
810,0.97,6810.436,6812.505,Either way.,144,,
811,0.97,6812.505,6823.183,That would be up to the Council.,144,,
812,0.97,6823.183,6824.884,Thank you.,144,,
813,0.97,6824.884,6836.362,This is another some what recent real world situation that I reflected upon.,145,,
814,0.97,6836.362,6847.507,This is a situation where a sponsor of legislation requested that legislation skip a committee and be assigned directly to full council.,145,,
815,0.97,6847.507,6862.455,I think that it would be great to consider that in cases when the committee chair is not the sponsor of that legislation.,145,,
816,0.97,6862.455,6865.658,That the expectation be created for the process.,145,,
817,0.97,6865.658,6866.226,The IRC process.,145,,
818,0.97,6866.226,6885.778,That the President consider the preference of the committee chair just to check right that a council member that's considering legislation that would normally go into that committee to make sure that committee chair agrees with that approach.,145,,
819,0.97,6885.778,6906.733,I think that creates an expectation that sort of minimizes undue pressure and influence on everybody involved when you have a sponsor of a piece of legislation who Iscreating a sense of urgency for that legislation to be heard.,145,,
820,0.97,6906.733,6912.071,I think there's a way to thread the needle on this one.,145,,
821,0.97,6912.071,6917.744,I would ask for Council Herbold and our offices to have a little more conversation about this one.,145,,
822,0.97,6917.744,6931.424,I think in practice the Council President generally Consults with and in some instances not just takes their preference into consideration but DEFERS to their preference.,145,,
823,0.97,6931.424,6933.126,But I want to make sure we get.,145,,
824,0.97,6933.126,6947.607,That whatever the language is in the rules is consistent with what the practice has been.,145,,
825,0.97,6947.607,6957.183,So that we are not creating sort of the inadvertent consequence of stone walling legislation in its entirety.,145,,
826,0.97,6957.183,6962.822,Because Council members still have the right to introduce legislation as part of their Charter duties.,145,,
827,0.97,6962.822,6985.611,So would love to have a conversation about how we can get that language nailed down in a way that might be reflective of the art that is making decisions from the Council President seat about referral with the benefit of having information and consultation with the chair responsible for that committee work.,145,,
828,0.97,6985.611,6993.419,I think there's a way for us to get there and hopefully we'll be able to do that over the next few days.,145,,
829,0.97,6993.419,7009.836,The other piece of this one Council member Herbold I'm intrigued by is the portion referring to substantive legislation not being referred to Council when Council meetings are suspended during budget deliberations.,145,,
830,0.97,7009.836,7013.006,I had had a conversation with director handy about creating a process.,145,,
831,0.97,7013.006,7023.249,Now the question is whether we want to put the process into Commission rules or policy.,145,,
832,0.97,7023.249,7065.758,In the event a council member is interested in proposing substantive legislation during budget process in we're all standing and regular committee and regular committee meetings have been canceled that the central staff director would need to obtain the written consent and permission from both the Council president and the budget chair in order to allow for Council central staff to either work on that legislation or green light the referral of that legislation to full council or any where else.,145,,
833,0.97,7065.758,7085.378,And in part of what we were modeling that after was the symbol to the process that we used in limiting whether or not special meetings can be had of certain committees because of time sensitive legislation.,145,,
834,0.97,7085.378,7098.491,So for example Council member Strauss because of time sensitive legislation the process we used for that was consistent for the budget chair and Council President office in order for those committees to be able to advance.,145,,
835,0.97,7098.491,7108.334,I don't know if that's something you would be interested in emulating in this space.,145,,
836,0.97,7108.334,7116.976,And or whether you prefer your language more or whether you would be comfortable in having that.,145,,
837,0.97,7116.976,7122.348,If you or other Council Memberswould have that exist in budget rules.,145,,
838,0.97,7122.348,7129.255,"Recognize that there's, this is a bad analogy there's more than one way to skin a cat.",146,,
839,0.97,7129.255,7134.594,I wouldn't want to skin a cat but I couldn't find another way to say it.,146,,
840,0.97,7134.594,7139.599,Underlying an objective not a path for getting there.,146,,
841,0.97,7139.599,7141.834,Appreciate your good thinking about that.,146,,
842,0.97,7141.834,7144.403,Before I stop talking about all of this.,146,,
843,0.97,7144.403,7149.175,Ma'am President I really appreciate your real world experience.,146,,
844,0.97,7149.175,7153.246,Over the last two years on helping us think about this for next year.,146,,
845,0.97,7153.246,7156.716,"Very, very very, very helpful.",146,,
846,0.97,7156.716,7157.116,My pleasure.,147,,
847,0.97,7157.116,7165.258,My pleasure okay colleagues we're getting close to the end of our time here it's 3:59 P.M.,147,,
848,0.97,7165.258,7177.503,Are there any other questions or comments that folks would like to add to the record here before we adjourn?,147,,
849,0.97,7177.503,7177.703,Okay.,147,,
850,0.97,7177.703,7178.471,Council member Strauss please.,147,,

852,0.97,7181.507,7186.879,Could you remind us again the time line and frame work for bringing forward.,148,,

854,0.97,7189.382,7201.594,Can you walk us through the process I know that at the beginning of the meeting I heard we will meet next week and have this out by the 13th but if you could just give us a refresher.,148,,
855,0.97,7201.594,7206.198,It's like your reading my script Council member Strauss.,149,,
856,0.97,7206.198,7207.233,I'm heading right there.,149,,
857,0.97,7207.233,7209.402,"Process wise, thank you everybody for joining us.",149,,
858,0.97,7209.402,7215.908,As a reminder the deadline to get amendment request to central staff is noon.,149,,

861,0.97,7217.21,7223.115,So we have a couple of days to work on this.,149,,
862,0.97,7223.115,7233.125,And we will take up the resolution and any proposed amendments during the December 8th special meeting of the Governance committee.,149,,

864,0.97,7234.46,7240.733,The goal is to have final action on this resolution on Monday December 13th at 2:00 P.M.,149,,
865,0.97,7240.733,7261.053,"So again even if you're on the fence with some of these amendments, I do want to Encounselor us to encourage us to daylight and bring those forward for transparency.",149,,
866,0.97,7261.053,7270.796,And if there are anything you would like to bring forward for transparency.,149,,
867,0.97,7270.796,7279.005,I would still like them to be discussed because I think that would be appropriate to do for this next meeting.,149,,
