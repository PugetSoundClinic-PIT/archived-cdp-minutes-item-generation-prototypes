175,0.97,1028.127,1033.065,My name is Allison Ford and I am the public policy manager for Uber in Seattle.,45,,
176,0.97,1033.065,1039.972,I am providing public comment today with deep concern for the Payup legislation as it is currently drafted.,45,,
177,0.97,1039.972,1050.716,"Uber is supportive of a driver earning standard policy, however this earning standards formula is so complex and costly that it will lead to a significantly more expensive service.",45,,
178,0.97,1050.716,1062.728,It has been drafted with no independent research to identify the cost to restaurants and consumers or what impact it will have on driver earning opportunities.,45,,
179,0.97,1062.728,1078.677,"Our Modelling estimates that this standard would result in the loss of thousands of Uber eats orders a week, which ultimately hurts small businesses, reduces work opportunities for platform drivers, and limits access to delivery services for communities that rely on them.",45,,
180,0.97,1078.677,1089.154,We request that Council reconsider this important legislation by taking the time to fully understand the many potential unintended consequences.,45,,
181,0.97,1089.154,1091.056,Thank you so much.,46,,
182,0.97,1091.056,1097.196,"Our next Speaker is Mackenzie Orr, and Mackenzie will be followed by James Thomas.",46,,
183,0.97,1097.196,1097.596,Hi.,47,,
184,0.97,1097.596,1103.836,"My name is Mackenzie, I work on the gig from Instacart.",47,,
185,0.97,1103.836,1113.812,I started doing gig work in 2020 because of an Autoimmune condition that made it hard to commit to a 40-Hour workweek.,47,,
186,0.97,1113.812,1124.356,I'm speaking today because gig workers like me are tired of being taken advantage of by multi million dollar companies.,47,,
187,0.97,1124.356,1127.326,We are low wages and unfair business practices.,47,,
188,0.97,1127.326,1132.898,To me any emergency that may arise may be devastating.,47,,
189,0.97,1132.898,1138.804,A flat tire or health issue may mean possible homelessness.,47,,
190,0.97,1138.804,1148.847,"I've had car accidents, injuries from carrying Extremey heavy grocery and denial of my claims because no one knew what the Seattle ordinance was for two years into it.",47,,
191,0.97,1148.847,1154.286,We need the Payup policy now because gig workers deserve protection.,47,,
192,0.97,1154.286,1159.057,These companies make billions and they benefit from gig workers not having a voice.,47,,
193,0.97,1159.057,1161.727,They are taking serious advantage of people and gig companies --,47,,
194,0.97,1161.727,1164.796,Thank you so much.,48,,
195,0.97,1164.796,1171.537,Our next Speaker is James Thomas.,48,,
196,0.97,1171.537,1173.539,Followed by Mackenzie case.,48,,

198,0.97,1174.907,1175.641,Good morning.,49,,
199,0.97,1175.641,1176.675,My name is James Thomas.,49,,
200,0.97,1176.675,1183.448,I'm a gig worker and I'm here because we need the Payup policy now.,49,,
201,0.97,1183.448,1186.952,I receive a small business loan that is coming through soon.,49,,
202,0.97,1186.952,1194.359,I borrowed the money based on being paid at 94 cents a mile by post mates the day that I signed the low agreement.,49,,
203,0.97,1194.359,1199.898,Now the pay has been reduced by over 22 cents per mile.,49,,
204,0.97,1199.898,1203.502,"Unlike restaurants and owners, I don't have the ability to raise the prices on my menu.",49,,
205,0.97,1203.502,1211.71,I have no choice but to pay the loan back or a longer time to struggle to fit it in my budget.,49,,
206,0.97,1211.71,1216.882,"As defined by the city of Seattle, gig owners are small business owners, too.",49,,
207,0.97,1216.882,1221.753,You should understand the need to charge enough for what you sell to make a profit.,49,,
208,0.97,1221.753,1232.764,Right now gig pay is so low that after our expenses we earn next to nothing.,49,,
209,0.97,1232.764,1240.272,Large corporations are making money hand over fist and they don't own the cars or have the expenses to make the business go.,49,,
210,0.97,1240.272,1242.374,Thank you so much.,50,,
211,0.97,1242.374,1248.28,Our next Speaker is Mackenzie case followed by--Mackenzie?,50,,

214,0.97,1260.826,1263.829,I'm here to speak about Spd-018-A-001 to gig workers.,51,,
215,0.97,1263.829,1275.374,I'm here to make sure they make a competitive wage as well as to access benefits like the state legislation Hb2076 which allows TNC drivers to access benefits.,51,,
216,0.97,1275.374,1282.114,Chamber strongly URGES you to take the necessary time to craft balance and thoughtful legislation to achieve these goals.,51,,
217,0.97,1282.114,1287.819,As currently drafted this legislation could apply to diverse business models from pet care to food delivery.,51,,
218,0.97,1287.819,1295.894,These businesses include Apps in which workers set their own rates and access scheduled services in blocks as opposed to individual deliveries and jobs.,51,,
219,0.97,1295.894,1302.0,The variety in business models and work necessitate that definitions and conclusions have to be carefully drafted.,51,,
220,0.97,1302.0,1310.275,We also urge city Council to study and address unintended harmful consequences for low income residences.,51,,
221,0.97,1310.275,1314.479,For example someone with limited mobility.,51,,
222,0.97,1314.479,1316.481,Thank you.,52,,

236,0.97,1363.462,1378.143,So we are strongly asking the Council members to put into consideration the hidden consequences which is putting too much pressure on the people who are working with the gig workers.,55,,
237,0.97,1378.143,1383.482,"So the gig companies, they just make all the money, but the gig workers, they don't make that much.",55,,
238,0.97,1383.482,1389.855,"So now, as we see, the living standard between the rich and the poor is getting wider and wider.",55,,
239,0.97,1389.855,1398.296,So the Council members should understand the situation and they should--especially the middle class in this company has to continue.,55,,
240,0.97,1398.296,1412.077,"So for that matter the Council members should understand all the consequences, all the problems, what we've seen in the city of Seattle, so for that matter we are asking to pass this legislation.",55,,
241,0.97,1412.077,1416.515,About all thank you Council members for your time and look into these matters and --,55,,

248,0.97,1443.008,1449.181,Tech net realizes the need for access to--work.,57,,
249,0.97,1449.181,1459.157,"-- underemployment to gain access to work on demand however this proposal has been drafted without a single piece of research to support it so it is unclear what the impacts might be on businesses, gig workers, or the community.",57,,
250,0.97,1459.157,1466.431,"We are concerned that it could have negative consequences like higher prices for consumers, drivers.",57,,
251,0.97,1466.431,1472.07,We respectfully ask for the Council to take the time to fully study the impact of the proposal before moving forward.,57,,
252,0.97,1472.07,1473.805,Thank you for your time.,57,,
253,0.97,1473.805,1474.873,Thank you.,58,,

257,0.97,1502.3,1509.641,"I'm Testifying today in support of CB 120294, the Payup legislation, and for me and other Caregivers it hits close to home.",59,,
258,0.97,1509.641,1520.886,"Many gig workers covered by this legislation, historically excluded from wage laws and labor standards.",59,,
259,0.97,1520.886,1527.225,We received no benefits and no protections like workers COMP or unemployment and no protection from Antidiscrimination laws.,59,,
260,0.97,1527.225,1539.17,It should come as no surprise that gig workers like Caregivers are disproportionately done by immigrants and people of cover.,59,,
261,0.97,1539.17,1546.611,"In the last two decades, Caregivers came together and fought back, winning the right to protection under the fair labor standards act.",59,,

267,0.97,1580.245,1595.894,"City Council is using the public safety committee to buy off a voting block of 30,000 gig workers while low level drug pushers destroy lives daily.",61,,

274,0.97,1638.737,1641.072,We are speaking for the Payup policy proposal.,63,,
275,0.97,1641.072,1649.848,Members of this committee should be aware that the unintended consequences of this bill will likely result in decreased demand.,63,,
276,0.97,1649.848,1657.088,It will increase costs for consumers and will ultimately jeopardize earning opportunities for workers.,63,,
277,0.97,1657.088,1672.07,"According to Instacart's calculations the formula outlines in the ordinance will put the minimum pay rate at approximately 170% of Seattle's minimum wage, already the highest minimum wage in the country.",63,,
278,0.97,1672.07,1682.013,Premium pay is still in effect which remains even higher yet no effect to potential impact on consumer demand and by extension earnings opportunities for Seattle workers.,63,,
279,0.97,1682.013,1692.19,We appreciate the right to take part in Stakeholder negotiations and will be submitting a counterproposal that we hope will be considered in future drafts of this ordinance.,63,,

298,0.97,1819.984,1825.623,It was a lot and took a lot for my pay.,67,,
299,0.97,1825.623,1828.459,It was squeaky from the company.,67,,
300,0.97,1828.459,1830.762,They did not pay enough income with expenses.,67,,
301,0.97,1830.762,1847.045,They would increase the pay and they would make more while we as workers would shop and deliver and making it much more harder for us.,67,,
302,0.97,1847.045,1860.191,It was not enough pay for the expenses.,67,,
303,0.97,1860.191,1863.361,Thank you so much.,67,,
304,0.97,1863.361,1866.564,"And I hope this passes, new policy.",67,,

315,0.97,1897.562,1927.091,"I'm Michelle Balser, a shopper for Instacart, and I am actually obviously in favor of this, and the biggest reason, in the last few months I've seen a big Drop-Off in customer orders and my fear is that with this mass hiring that Instacart does and a lot of the Gigs do, service has kind of gone down and therefore customers are not real--have lost faith in their orders and what they're going to get.",73,,
316,0.97,1927.091,1938.136,"And I see part of it, the policy will ensure that quality increases because they'll pay for the good shoppers, people shopping fast and shopping accurate.",73,,
317,0.97,1938.136,1941.406,"And so this really would benefit the company, the customer, and the shoppers.",73,,
318,0.97,1941.406,1958.156,"We would be ensured that the good people who actually want to be doing this job and care about the customers would be out there shopping and we wouldn't see the decrease, we'd see an increase, if not stabilization of the customers and I think Instacart would see the increase.",73,,
319,0.97,1958.156,1960.591,Thank you so much.,74,,
320,0.97,1960.591,1963.561,Our next Speaker is Shelby Hanson.,74,,

322,0.97,1970.401,1970.601,Hi.,75,,
323,0.97,1970.601,1974.305,I'm Shelby and I'm a gig worker.,75,,
324,0.97,1974.305,1981.746,I'm a new member of the Payup campaign.,75,,
325,0.97,1981.746,1986.117,"I work for the Rover App, service.",75,,
326,0.97,1986.117,1997.895,"My pet sitting service was not honest about the--of their dog and medical bills, and I was not able to work their dogs because I had such a fear for them.",75,,
327,0.97,1997.895,2004.102,So would always encourage a worker--well-paid in order to undercut other Rover workers.,75,,
328,0.97,2004.102,2010.875,This base pay isn't enough to sustain a livable wage let alone to deal with medical bills.,75,,
329,0.97,2010.875,2018.316,Rover takes 20% of each and every job I do.,75,,

333,0.97,2026.624,2029.06,You would have thought they would treat us better.,75,,
334,0.97,2029.06,2031.195,Thank you for listening to me.,75,,
335,0.97,2031.195,2034.098,We need the Seattle city Council to --,75,,
336,0.97,2034.098,2036.834,Thank you so much.,76,,
337,0.97,2036.834,2047.812,Our next Speaker is Aaron--and Aaron will be our last Speaker.,76,,

339,0.97,2048.012,2049.881,Go ahead.,76,,
340,0.97,2049.881,2052.383,Thank you Council member Mike.,77,,
341,0.97,2052.383,2055.52,I'm representing the Washington coalition for independent work.,77,,
342,0.97,2055.52,2060.057,Members of our coalition have long advocated for minimum standards for our industry.,77,,
343,0.97,2060.057,2071.335,They advocated for the recently adopted earning standard in California and currently support a ballot measure in Massachusetts that would provide the same benefits for workers.,77,,
344,0.97,2071.335,2075.873,Unfortunately the proposed Payup legislation while well intentioned is poorly drafted.,77,,
345,0.97,2075.873,2078.81,It increases costs without regard for consumers.,77,,
346,0.97,2078.81,2101.499,"Broadly mandated that drivers paid more than double on a Per-Trip basis without regard to the impact on businesses, consumers and ultimately drivers themselves of the if they're driven out of reach through mandatory legislation, then everyone will be hurt, including the drivers who will lose work as consumers choose other options or simply forego certain services.",77,,
347,0.97,2101.499,2111.242,"The proposal is far too broad, would go far beyond delivery services and would impact sites like Angie's list and Care.Com.",77,,
348,0.97,2111.242,2111.742,Thank you so much.,78,,
349,0.97,2111.742,2118.816,"I realize we have other people to sign up but we weren't able to accommodate you today, in today's meeting.",78,,
350,0.97,2118.816,2135.733,"We do have a number of Presenters today on the agenda who are fixed time for availability for their presentations, so we don't have as much flexibility as we would normally hope to accommodate more.",78,,
351,0.97,2135.733,2141.005,"With that, the public comment period is closed.",78,,
352,0.97,2141.005,2144.709,We will go into agenda item one.,78,,
353,0.97,2144.709,2149.046,Agenda item number one.,79,,
354,0.97,2149.046,2155.119,"Update on statement of legislative intent Sli Cbo-013-A-002, citywide hiring incentives for briefing and discussion.",79,,
355,0.97,2155.119,2155.82,Fantastic.,80,,
356,0.97,2155.82,2157.054,Thank you so much.,80,,
357,0.97,2157.054,2162.193,We're joined by interim director Kimberly loving and Keith gully of the Seattle Department of human resources.,80,,
358,0.97,2162.193,2174.372,"Thank you so much for filling in to present this report on the statement of legislative intent on hiring incentives, really appreciate you being here with us today.",80,,
359,0.97,2174.372,2187.552,"Just before we get started, just a few--just do a quick introduction of yourself and then we'll hand it to you for your presentation.",80,,
360,0.97,2187.552,2189.353,Thank you.,81,,
361,0.97,2189.353,2190.888,My name is Keith gully.,81,,
362,0.97,2190.888,2196.561,I'm the director for the Seattle Department of human resources so I'm glad to be here for that.,81,,
363,0.97,2196.561,2199.063,Pleasure to meet you all.,81,,
364,0.97,2199.063,2201.098,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",82,,
365,0.97,2201.098,2204.702,"This is Kimberly loving, hr director for the city of Seattle, and we're happy to be here.",82,,
366,0.97,2204.702,2221.085,"As you know, we're stepping in to try to--I think is probably the best way to put it as senior member Harrell was unable to attend and we're happy to answer any questions that we're able to today.",82,,
367,0.97,2221.085,2224.388,"Thank you so much, director loving.",83,,
368,0.97,2224.388,2230.861,"Again, we really appreciate your graciously stepping in at the last moment to do this presentation.",83,,
369,0.97,2230.861,2245.276,"I will request that Council members hold questions that they might have until after the presentation, and for the viewing public, just to Orient you, as director said, this is I think a table setting conversation.",83,,
370,0.97,2245.276,2258.255,This item is the response from the Seattle Department of human resources to the Council's request with the November bid process regarding citywide hiring incentives.,83,,
371,0.97,2258.255,2271.369,"Consideration of a resolution that Council member Nelson is sponsoring on hiring bonuses is scheduled for the public safety and human services Committee on the 26th, two weeks from today.",83,,
372,0.97,2271.369,2322.887,"But this is the--a presentation on the need or lack thereof for bonuses or incentives to encourage hiring in departments throughout the city, not simply focused on the Seattle--was a statement of legislative intent response was scheduled to go to Council member Mosqueda's Finance and housing committee and she graciously let me have the discussion here in the public safety Committee, with the understanding that it will likely--some of the discussion will likely relate to next committee meeting and the resolution that I mentioned from Council member Nelson.",83,,
373,0.97,2322.887,2327.391,"And so with that, I'll just hand it over.",83,,
374,0.97,2327.391,2329.694,Thank you for being with us.,83,,
375,0.97,2329.694,2330.961,"Thank you, council member.",84,,
376,0.97,2330.961,2331.729,We both really appreciate it.,84,,
377,0.97,2331.729,2346.277,I just want to kind of jump in the high-level portions of this and just kind of start off and let you all know that this was really a team and collective effort led by basically citywide Recruiters and Department heads across the city.,84,,
378,0.97,2346.277,2358.823,"When we got the request a few months back, the idea of it was really to hear our Stakeholders, get an idea of what are the challenges, what are the high-level priority positions that we're having challenges for.",84,,
379,0.97,2358.823,2375.806,"So we as Recruiters across the city, we meet every other Thursday, and we really focus in on some of those trends, what are each Department seeing, what are the Heartburns around different positions, what are some of the challenges, how we can come together as a recruiting network to support each other.",84,,
380,0.97,2375.806,2380.578,"Postings, whether it be posting jobs on Linkedin or just sharing our network.",84,,
381,0.97,2380.578,2398.829,"From those meetings, we found out it was the--the best practice was to do a survey, and we surveyed all the citywide Recruiters across the city for each Department and really got feedback from them on some of those high-level critical roles to fill.",84,,
382,0.97,2398.829,2409.273,About five days later we called a meeting with the Department heads across the city and had a discussion of what are some of the trends they are seeing within their departments and how can we come together and really focus on this thing.,84,,
383,0.97,2409.273,2412.877,So it wasn't just a Seattle Department of human resources decision.,84,,
384,0.97,2412.877,2413.744,It was a team decision.,84,,
385,0.97,2413.744,2421.452,And you know we really kind of came to the conclusion in regards to the citywide hiring and said what that would look like for the future.,84,,
386,0.97,2421.452,2430.594,"I just wanted to kind of go over to set the table for everybody, but also do kind of a little bit of a high-level review of all those positions that came in hand.",84,,
387,0.97,2430.594,2441.972,"So like I said, we reached out to the city departments, identified Hard-To-Fill positions and the fact that it was Impacting the city's ability to higher talent.",84,,
388,0.97,2441.972,2449.947,At the hr we found many factors that affect the ability to attract full-time workers.,84,,
389,0.97,2449.947,2454.084,Most are full-time benefits and from temporary to full-time employment.,84,,
390,0.97,2454.084,2462.86,We felt like the temporary pool was the most diverse pool but we really take advantage of to fill different gaps in different areas to help support staffing across the city.,84,,
391,0.97,2462.86,2473.471,Hiring incentives to what we came to the conclusion are more of a short-term strategy to attract more applicants.,84,,
392,0.97,2473.471,2478.876,The city began offering incentives in 2021 for certain public safety positions.,84,,
393,0.97,2478.876,2485.716,Seattle police Department did not increase an increase in hiring since implementing a hiring incentives in October of 2021.,84,,
394,0.97,2485.716,2495.192,The community safety and communications center however did see an increase in candidates entering the hiring process since the implementation of an incentive in October of 2021.,84,,
395,0.97,2495.192,2501.265,"Based on the limited time frame for the incentive, though, there wasn't enough time to get conclusive data.",84,,
396,0.97,2501.265,2516.146,"In addition, based on the feedback we received, like I said, we did our road show from the city Department, so largest barrier to attract and promoting and retaining talent is our compensation program.",84,,
397,0.97,2516.146,2521.752,"That's where a majority of our employees who have worked for the city get stuck, in the classification system.",84,,
398,0.97,2521.752,2527.525,"Just to kind of give you an idea around that, our class specifications are from 1990.",84,,
399,0.97,2527.525,2529.426,They have not been updated since 1990.,84,,
400,0.97,2529.426,2544.008,"So give you an example, if a person is trying to hire, say they've been with the city in an accounting position for maybe 15 or 20 years, we feel like transferable skills and the fact their work experience can substitute, a lot of times, for education.",84,,
401,0.97,2544.008,2554.585,"With this certain classification, if a person is trying to go for a senior accounting position, they have to have 24 hours of semester work.",84,,
402,0.97,2554.585,2567.698,"And, you know, we've had employees get kind of stuck in those type of positions and Unfortunately they're unable to advance their career, which really impacts departments to sometimes be able to see those promotions for employees.",84,,
403,0.97,2567.698,2581.178,"About two years ago before the pandemic, we did a citywide job fair and we really focused in on just city employees and we invited all our temporary employees.",84,,
404,0.97,2581.178,2591.655,"And we had a huge, huge turnout, and the exciting part about it, we had folks that were able to get connected up that were in those temporary positions for a while, connected up in the full-time opportunities.",84,,
405,0.97,2591.655,2611.508,"And we found out there was a lot of, like I said, barriers within those prospects that I think if we put our efforts and resources in looking at some of the class Specs in the positions that I will talk about, there's some ways where we can knock down some of those challenges.",84,,
406,0.97,2611.508,2615.379,"So within our retention challenges, we created a recruitment challenges survey.",84,,
407,0.97,2615.379,2630.294,I'll give you a list of the following positions that were listed as critical city business needs.,84,,
408,0.97,2630.294,2641.905,"Carpenter, plumber, truck driver, Rec attendants, civil engineer, police officers, Hvac technicians, Cashiers, engineers public safety auditor, veterinary, and 911 Dispatchers.",84,,
409,0.97,2641.905,2668.599,"The lack of qualified candidates was a primary factor identified for these Hard-To-Fill roles and survey once again came back around to minimum qualifications, constraints in the city's outdated classification system that crosses those barriers to retain, promote, and really hire internal and external women and Bipoc into the city.",84,,
410,0.97,2668.599,2678.809,"So really kind of with Sbhr, we took an idea and looked at some of the trends and some of the other things that really impacted, you know, some of those challenges.",84,,
411,0.97,2678.809,2681.745,So I go back to class Specs.,84,,
412,0.97,2681.745,2694.091,"You know, as far as the job duties described in these job classifications, they don't always pertain to the work that needs to be completed by today's city work force.",84,,
413,0.97,2694.091,2709.139,Updating the city's 30-year-old classification system I think will improve the city's ability to attract entry level skilled trades and other positions with transferable skills and lived experience can be substituted for education requirements for multiple years of work and experience.,84,,
414,0.97,2709.139,2727.958,"The task to review the job classification system is definitely significant, but it is an update to the system and even if we start out with maybe 20 or 30 classifications that are critical roles and we're not seeing the talent come through in the challenges of recruiting, maybe we focus in on those first.",84,,
415,0.97,2727.958,2734.832,So this was really kind of the conclusion in regards to the hiring incentive and really some pros and Cons.,84,,
416,0.97,2734.832,2739.503,Offering a hiring incentive is a short-time strategy like was mentioned earlier.,84,,
417,0.97,2739.503,2749.713,"You know, of course you'll probably get a person to accept the offer, but in the King County area, other local jurisdictions have been offering similar hiring incentives.",84,,
418,0.97,2749.713,2763.56,"While have departments in the city of Seattle have observed a clear and positive benefit, this must be weighed against other situations where this can approach and really has inherent drawbacks and equity issues for both employers and employees.",84,,
419,0.97,2763.56,2777.141,"So, for example, once an employee is on board, even a structured signing bonus with additional PAYOUT has limited impact on retention.",84,,
420,0.97,2777.141,2787.251,The money is a one-time quick fix which may not address competitive wages.,84,,
421,0.97,2787.251,2795.159,Lack of opportunity to develop skills and promotion.,84,,
422,0.97,2795.159,2807.571,-- employees promoted internally or already working in the job can really feel undervalued or Underappreciated when the financial package does not match what external recruits receive.,84,,
423,0.97,2807.571,2826.49,And especially coming out of the pandemic and retaining our employees and making sure they're not leaving us for other opportunities and with the current city employees identified with the Hard-To-Fill positions it's really hard to maintain our front line employees and really focus on taking care of them.,84,,
424,0.97,2826.49,2833.163,So I go back to those really things about the critical roles and about the hiring incentive.,84,,
425,0.97,2833.163,2841.672,"You know, there are some other ways to attract and retain talent, so I'll go back to using the resources that we have internally.",84,,
426,0.97,2841.672,2845.409,"A few of those resources, we have a great Internship program.",84,,
427,0.97,2845.409,2858.222,"If departments really start to really invest and focus in on our college interns, our Syep, our high school interns, our apprenticeship, we can build some great pipelines there.",84,,
428,0.97,2858.222,2866.363,"Through social media, we actually asked hr approaches the Linkedin web pages for the whole city, so all departments can take advantage of this free of charge.",84,,
429,0.97,2866.363,2883.013,"They can build like a life cycle and a life page tab to focus in on what's going on in their Department, talk about different opportunities that may be coming up, different large projects that the city is promoting.",84,,
430,0.97,2883.013,2889.653,There's a lot of great work that gets done across the city and it's time to promote those opportunities outside of really our networks.,84,,
431,0.97,2889.653,2906.103,"Like I said, another way would be really to focus in on doing Reinterviewing our employees that we have right now, doing those focus time, whether it be our one on ones, but just talking about what are the things they would like to see?",84,,
432,0.97,2906.103,2911.074,"What are the challenges that they're having, how can we support them getting promoted into other opportunities?",84,,
433,0.97,2911.074,2941.905,"So like I said, end of the day, we did this as a team and we looked at all the different factors into this, and I know it's--it definitely worked for Cscc, sounded like they experienced some really high recruiting rates, which was great, but our fear was if you get that person here for, you know, six months and then after six months, you know, as far as the pay goes, they're not going to see another pay bump for another year, their pay is going to stay the same.",84,,
434,0.97,2941.905,2943.006,So will their morale drop?,84,,
435,0.97,2943.006,2945.442,Can we focus in on some different areas?,84,,
436,0.97,2945.442,2953.116,"And I feel like, you know, given the person obviously a job opportunity, but seeing a way out they can promote up through the city.",84,,
437,0.97,2953.116,2955.886,And we have so many different opportunities across the city.,84,,
438,0.97,2955.886,2962.092,"I really focus in on, you know, we're one city, but we have many career opportunities that we can offer.",84,,
439,0.97,2962.092,2964.594,So a person never has to leave.,84,,
440,0.97,2964.594,2971.068,It's really important for us to promote those opportunities internally and really focus on sharing those job opportunities across the city network.,84,,
441,0.97,2971.068,2980.577,"So that's really kind of a high-level review of the work we did, and really, you know, what we really recommended going forward.",84,,
442,0.97,2980.577,2984.448,"But there's a lot of space, you know, around recruitment.",84,,
443,0.97,2984.448,2991.388,One thing I will bring up before I open up for questions is really around the support for recruiting.,84,,
444,0.97,2991.388,2994.291,"You know, one thing about recruiting, it's a team effort.",84,,
445,0.97,2994.291,2996.994,It's not just a recruiter's job.,84,,
446,0.97,2996.994,2997.627,It's a team effort.,84,,
447,0.97,2997.627,3009.272,"So more we can team up with hiring managers and our employees, you know, whether it be employee referrals and things like that, it's going to help.",84,,
448,0.97,3009.272,3015.479,"Resources even having recruitment for Recruiters, finding maybe a recruiting team that just focuses in on outreach.",84,,
449,0.97,3015.479,3023.854,"Maybe that recruiting team goes to different colleges or universities or high schools and talking to students about career opportunities in Seattle police Department, the fire Department.",84,,
450,0.97,3023.854,3030.327,"You know, if you want to be Hvac, you know, employee, those type of critical roles.",84,,
451,0.97,3030.327,3044.241,I think there's some opportunity for us to be able to build into our Recruiters in network right now and then our departments and the way we can really kind of share those resources that we all need in order to make our staffing a lot easier.,84,,
452,0.97,3044.241,3073.036,"That's one of the things I really focus in on is, you know, diversity and I feel like, you know, if we do a recruiting bonus, it's a great idea but like I said, focusing in on that long-term solution would be looking at those aspects examine that will and that's the way we'll be able to retrain and attract our work forces.",84,,
453,0.97,3073.036,3074.371,Thank you so much.,85,,
454,0.97,3074.371,3090.353,I appreciate your zeroing in on this sort of historical and structural barrier to people from within the city who have a lot of experience doing work.,85,,
455,0.97,3090.353,3099.129,Advancing is Sdhr looking at making it a--to those classifications to remove some of those barriers?,85,,
456,0.97,3099.129,3101.097,Please repeat your question.,86,,
457,0.97,3101.097,3119.95,"As it relates to the barriers within the classifications on requiring degrees or classroom credits as opposed to applying folks' experience, working for the Department, working in a particular function.",87,,
458,0.97,3119.95,3124.321,Is this a body of work that Sdhr is going to be addressing?,87,,
459,0.97,3124.321,3129.426,This is the body of work that we can't address without resources.,88,,
460,0.97,3129.426,3147.444,So this body of work would take an outside consultant to come in and look at our 400-Plus class Specs in our system and look at those jobs and look at that body of work and basically bring that up to 2022.,88,,
461,0.97,3147.444,3153.416,"Like I said earlier, you know, I worked with James quite a bit with technology.",88,,
462,0.97,3153.416,3154.117,Work changes by the minute.,88,,
463,0.97,3154.117,3165.228,"In order for us to keep up with the times and succession plan and focus in on our intern ships and really build those into pipelines, we have to break down those class Specs.",88,,
464,0.97,3165.228,3176.306,"So as far as us being able to do that, Sdhr, it's a team for across city departments, but we just don't have the resources to be able to do that.",88,,
465,0.97,3176.306,3184.047,Can't just add more relevant work experience to all the job classifications?,89,,
466,0.97,3184.047,3191.955,"So that's one thing that we're here, we definitely do, try to focus in on those shared experiences.",90,,
467,0.97,3191.955,3195.725,I really feel like transferable skills can--are great.,90,,
468,0.97,3195.725,3220.217,"I mean, the process that we use right now for hiring is called tea, talent, experience, and alignment, and we really focus in on the talent, more the potential of the candidate and the alignment, allowing the mission and values of the city and working for the community and giving back to the community.",90,,
469,0.97,3220.217,3223.219,And taking the focus less on the education.,90,,
470,0.97,3223.219,3244.841,"So when Recruiters are looking they are evaluating that talent that way but then the challenge comes in to once a person gets to Maybe that screening stage and they're looking at those class Specs like I mentioned with the accountant, that one or two things in those class Specs really holds them back from moving forward and gaining that opportunity.",90,,
471,0.97,3244.841,3245.175,Thank you.,91,,
472,0.97,3245.175,3248.278,Looking to see whether or not my colleagues have questions.,91,,
473,0.97,3248.278,3265.362,"I know a number of us had questions after receiving the report itself, and really appreciate that the Department acted quickly to get us back some of those answers in time for this committee discussion.",91,,
474,0.97,3265.362,3276.673,Perhaps this might be a good time to lift up for those questions and answers if Council members wish to do so.,91,,
475,0.97,3276.673,3279.976,And I'm not seeing any raised hands here.,91,,
476,0.97,3279.976,3281.144,So I'm just going to --,91,,
477,0.97,3281.144,3283.747,I think somebody else has their hand up.,92,,
478,0.97,3283.747,3284.381,"Oh, I'm so sorry.",93,,
479,0.97,3284.381,3287.384,I'm not sure why I don't see it.,93,,
480,0.97,3287.384,3289.686,"There you go, council member Nelson.",93,,
481,0.97,3289.686,3291.521,"Thank you so much, Alex.",93,,
482,0.97,3291.521,3295.892,"Thank you very much, chair.",94,,
483,0.97,3295.892,3306.903,So I realize that the discussion on public safety incentives is going to be had in the next public safety and human services meeting.,94,,
484,0.97,3306.903,3377.006,"However, because this document, this Two-Page document, half of it was about public safety incentives, I do want to say that this is one area where we don't need a consultant really to study the benefit of incentives because interim chief Diaz did say in previous meetings that other cities do have these--just incentives, whether or not they be called hiring, et cetera, and this is one area that we can implement right away because it has been shown to work in other cities, pretty much most, if not all cities in our region do have this and it's been said that we need to level the playing field for offering--because public safety as we've been hearing in the news is such a crucial issue right now, I don't think that--I just wanted to make--to mention that this is something that doesn't need a lot more.",94,,
485,0.97,3377.006,3377.874,So thank you very much.,94,,
486,0.97,3377.874,3378.041,.,95,,
487,0.97,3378.041,3379.042,"Thank you, council member.",96,,
488,0.97,3379.042,3379.976,Thanks so much.,97,,
489,0.97,3379.976,3400.597,"As it relates specifically to the SPD portion of this report, I do want to highlight that covered a relatively small number of months.",97,,
490,0.97,3400.597,3436.533,"There was an evident response in the way of increased applications as it relates to the 911 center at the Cscc, whereas the police Department, I think someone said or suggested that the benefit in offering the bonuses is that more people apply to become police officers, and, again, that was--that happened definitely with Cscc.",97,,
491,0.97,3436.533,3440.403,Not appeared to happen a whole lot with the police Department.,97,,
492,0.97,3440.403,3452.715,They did receive slightly fewer entry level applications per day after the hiring incentive announcement compared to the number of applications before the announcement.,97,,
493,0.97,3452.715,3466.529,"And then as it relates to lateral applications, they did receive about the same number since the hiring incentive announcements as they did before.",97,,
494,0.97,3466.529,3478.541,"It's not clear for SPD that the bonuses resulted in more people applying, but it does appear that it had that function for Cscc.",97,,
495,0.97,3478.541,3516.813,"I do want to remind folks that we also had a study on--a preliminary study think would be fair to characterize it on the incentive program that was approved by the Council in 2019, and that preliminary assessment showed that about one in five identified the existence of the incentive as being a consideration in their decision to apply.",97,,
496,0.97,3516.813,3518.481,That's a relatively small number.,97,,
497,0.97,3518.481,3540.403,"It's not--it doesn't look into whether or not there was an increase in applications, just simply that one in five people said that the incentive had something to do with their interest in applying.",97,,
498,0.97,3540.403,3577.473,"And then to characterize one of the questions I asked in runup to this presentation today after receiving the presentation, perhaps you can talk a little bit about what we found when we looked at the ability of departments to offer compensation for people's relocation assistance.",97,,
499,0.97,3577.473,3586.716,"Oftentimes particularly in situations where we're doing a hiring push, we're looking at hiring people from other jurisdictions.",97,,
500,0.97,3586.983,3641.07,"Having some additional flexibility to pay for the relocation costs when he is doing lateral hires from other jurisdictions, other jurisdictions that may have a lower standard of living and a lower salary for those particular applicants because they have a lower salary where they are working, they haven't been able to save money for a big move across the country.",97,,
501,0.97,3641.07,3658.788,"So, it's been really helpful to the police Department to use sort of what was originally designed as sort of a general bonus incentive program but specifically for that function of paying relocation costs.",97,,
502,0.97,3658.788,3671.634,So when I heard that I was interested in what the city's policy was across all the departments for types of jobs.,97,,
503,0.97,3671.634,3682.011,Relocation costs for Department director or deputy director that you want to maybe have come to the city.,97,,
504,0.97,3682.011,3711.007,"But for other positions where we have challenges, recruiting, what is the existing policy across the departments and whether or not if we wanted to see more of that and address what I think might be equity issues in the practices that might tend to focusing the compensation for relocation costs to higher level workers, sort of--where are we at on that?",97,,
505,0.97,3711.007,3722.752,What is the personnel policy Scan tell us about that right now?,97,,
506,0.97,3722.752,3724.253,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",98,,
507,0.97,3724.253,3726.522,We have 4.2.9 under moving expenses.,98,,
508,0.97,3726.522,3734.931,"As you read through the rule, please note that it will talk about salary range, 400 in salary range, 300.",98,,
509,0.97,3734.931,3743.272,These ranges refer to the city salary schedule for pay grades.,98,,
510,0.97,3743.272,3756.953,"For 2022, grade, 300 level salary range, between 3544 to 33176 and grade 400, 52.41 to 60.78.",98,,
511,0.97,3756.953,3761.924,"So, kind of read through the rule and kind of go over it in general a bit.",98,,
512,0.97,3761.924,3794.29,"But the positions identified in the salary ordinance as admitted by salary range 400 and above or salary equivalent or higher than the top step of range 400 when no range is given or positions under salary range 400 but over salary range 300 or equivalent there to for which the employee unit was able R unable to recruit persons in the immediate area that possessed the unique skills, expertise or education requirements.",98,,
513,0.97,3794.29,3808.671,"Or positions assigned to Apex Sam executive program, manager's compensation or strategic advisory compensation program, don't meet the he will guilt criteria.",98,,
514,0.97,3808.671,3834.564,"So, long story short, there is opportunity here to utilize moving expenses, relocation expenses but looking at those ranges first, one thing I would need to go back and basically be able to get back to you and make it more clear, is there--can we go below that level, below the 400 or 300 level.",98,,
515,0.97,3834.564,3837.266,It's for filling critical and Hashed to fill positions.,98,,
516,0.97,3837.266,3843.372,"Of if they are out of state, it's a great opportunity to bring in that talent from out of state.",98,,
517,0.97,3843.372,3880.776,"That is one of the things above many, great things about the Recruitments across the city, they focus in on recruiting talent out of the state but also retaining our talent here within the state and keeping them here if we can with the city but if they aren't able to find the talent, they can go out and you will Liz the--utilize the relocation packages here.",98,,
518,0.97,3880.776,3881.143,Thank you.,99,,
519,0.97,3881.143,3886.983,Councilmember? Mosqueda.,99,,
520,0.97,3886.983,3889.485,Sorry.,100,,
521,0.97,3889.485,3892.088,I am doing duel screenings with my phone.,100,,
522,0.97,3892.088,3893.489,My Audio was having issues.,100,,
523,0.97,3893.489,3896.759,Can you hear me okay?,100,,
524,0.97,3896.759,3897.059,Excellent.,100,,
525,0.97,3897.059,3909.372,I want to thank you for the opportunity to ask these questions and Madam chair I appreciate your leadership here in bringing forward this item on today's agenda and your leadership during budget.,100,,
526,0.97,3909.372,3919.248,I want to remind folks about the reason that we are having this conversations.,100,,
527,0.97,3919.248,3933.663,We heard from a number of individuals about the need for us to look at ways that we can create a stronger healthier recovery to the pan and look at stability within our departments.,100,,
528,0.97,3933.663,3954.05,"We have a sponsor--slide 013- 0002 along with Councilmember Herbold because we had years of conversations of folks in the city family, with frontline workers and city unions about ways to improve retention and recruitment Straits.",100,,
529,0.97,3954.05,3964.894,"Create a healthy work environment, stability, ways to create attractive place for people to come that are younger workers and especially as he said, diverse workers.",100,,
530,0.97,3964.894,3974.637,It's in the spirit of looking across the city family to address diversity and stability in the departments that this slide was brought forward.,100,,
531,0.97,3974.637,3977.106,I want to apologize to you on behalf of the Council.,100,,
532,0.97,3977.106,4000.796,"I think the work that you did was Impugned by one of my collection that deduced it to--I think it yield very important, not only Quan Taketive analysis but Quail Lattif analysis that should be taken to heart and weighed against one individual's comments that is not steeped in this work.",100,,
533,0.97,4000.796,4010.706,"I want to thank you for the team that you pulled together, robust conversations about what data driven recruitment and I believe retention strategies should look like.",100,,
534,0.97,4010.706,4019.882,I think it's important for us to have the conversation about what you highlighted in your summary comments.,100,,
535,0.97,4019.882,4031.927,"If I may read that from, Madam chair, offering incentive programs is a short term strategy meant to--as you said in the good chair repeated it does increase the pool of applicants.",100,,
536,0.97,4031.927,4044.94,"However, you went on to note that there is clear evidence that must be weighted against situations where this has the potential and inherent drawbacks and embedded equity issues for employee and please.",100,,
537,0.97,4044.94,4055.918,"When an employee is on board, a structured sign on bonus with additional PAYOUT tied to time in service has limited impact.",100,,
538,0.97,4055.918,4056.919,Limited impact on retention.,100,,
539,0.97,4056.919,4073.102,The money is a one time quick fix that may not compensate for uncompetitive wages which we are working to address via a budget item that we included last year to look at competitive pay salaries across the board.,100,,
540,0.97,4073.102,4084.313,"As the unions and frontline workers asked for, how to create stability and use wages as a recruitment tool once we adjusted for the wages which has been asked for many years.",100,,
541,0.97,4084.313,4091.787,The money is a one time fix that cannot compensate for uncompetitive wages.,100,,
542,0.97,4091.787,4101.197,"Difficult or Unsupportive working conditions, specifically child care and the ability to have flexible seated Dulles to pick up Kiddos when we don't have sufficient child care in the city.",100,,
543,0.97,4101.197,4104.867,That is what we have heard from frontline workers.,100,,
544,0.97,4104.867,4117.179,"Importantly, as you noted, it does not compensate for the lack of opportunities to develop career relevance, experience and skills, limited opportunities.",100,,
545,0.97,4117.179,4131.927,I appreciate you emphasizing these but noting that there are programs in place that if they had adequate resources and perhaps investments over time could build things like the apprenticeship and incertain ships.,100,,
546,0.97,4131.927,4166.095,"We heard from workers that what they are looking for is work structures that allow them a place for Kiddos and flexible time if caring for parents and that is what we are trying to do as well in addition to building a child care on site promote and build it across the city and I think there is a lot of work to be done in this arena like in D.C. where they have made child care a part of each of the Federal buildings to really make sure that workers have access to appropriate, accessibility and affordable child care.",100,,
547,0.97,4166.095,4171.7,The signing bonuses for newly hired talent outside can negatively impact employee moral.,100,,
548,0.97,4171.7,4175.271,I wanted to comment on this.,100,,
549,0.97,4175.271,4190.553,"In this moment, this is the time for us to be looking at how we can make sure that workers not only feel respective in the workplace but we are putting money toward making sure that they feel that this is the place for them to stay.",100,,
550,0.97,4190.553,4200.095,"In this highly competitive work environment that we have as we emerge from Covid, it's cite crawl that we do everything that we can to look at retention strategies.",100,,
551,0.97,4200.095,4204.266,I bring up the intent of this slide.,100,,
552,0.97,4204.266,4213.576,"It's not just retention strategies in one Department, given a lot of focus on that, but retention and recruitment strategies in every Department.",100,,
553,0.97,4213.576,4220.983,Not every single Department had hiring incentive plan fully funded.,100,,
554,0.97,4220.983,4221.25,Spd did.,100,,
555,0.97,4221.25,4224.92,They had the hiring plan fully funded.,100,,
556,0.97,4224.92,4230.159,Not every Department had a full hiring plan that allowed for them to continue to have growth.,100,,
557,0.97,4230.159,4259.188,"I think this is the time for us to look across the departments as the good chair and I were interested in, what the strategies and data driven approaches might be and it Hark Kens back to what the original intent was with frontline workers how to create a more equitable diverse and thriving city, family for core government functions that allows for the local economy to thrive and succeed as well.",100,,
558,0.97,4259.188,4268.23,I look forward to continuing the conversation about the key Takeaways from the analysis.,100,,
559,0.97,4268.23,4302.431,It's short in length but deep in substance in terms of what the potential unintended consequences would be if we were to be shortsighted and look at only hiring incentives and not take into account the impact on existing employees and the ways in which we can diversify our workforce t strengthen the workforce and create a more stable environment for those here and the ones we want to recruit.,100,,
560,0.97,4302.431,4316.445,What existing programs or built up programs should we be looking at for retention in that diverse workforce.,100,,
561,0.97,4316.445,4322.451,I see Councilmember Lewis's hand up.,101,,
562,0.97,4322.451,4323.952,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",102,,
563,0.97,4323.952,4346.075,"Given that we are having this conversation a week in advance, I think I might take the opportunity to Queue up a couple of discussion items for Presenters to be prepared for when we take this up at the 26th meeting in more detail, this discussion about the, you know, pay incentives for the police Department or whatever.",102,,
564,0.97,4346.075,4353.215,"I think for the next committee meeting, Councilmember Lewis we will have a different panel of folks.",103,,
565,0.97,4353.215,4353.515,I know.,104,,
566,0.97,4353.515,4358.654,But I'm sure that they are watching and listening to the committee now.,104,,
567,0.97,4358.654,4369.098,"Because we are going back and forth around hiring incentives, what we are really talking about is the Council put forward a 125 officer hiring plan.",104,,
568,0.97,4369.098,4375.137,I assume the entire Council or at least the Council majority would like to see that plan realized.,104,,
569,0.97,4375.137,4383.145,The question is how do we hire 125 people.,104,,
570,0.97,4383.145,4390.919,"It's not necessarily debating square peg, round hole on what thing will get the 125 positions filled, right?",104,,
571,0.97,4390.919,4401.73,"So, we are going to discuss and I know that there is some evidence on both sides about whether the hiring incentive is something that they can help us realize that goal.",104,,
572,0.97,4401.73,4407.936,That is a discussion that we can have and are having and I look forward to having again in a week.,104,,
573,0.97,4407.936,4440.536,"But what I would just ask is that we also maybe have a bit of a broader focus and I know that this is in line with what chair Herbold would like to do in how we talk about this, in what would be helpful for me is maybe hearing what major American city is actually able to hire officers right now at a rate higher than the attrition of losing and maybe see if whatever that city is doing go work here.",104,,
574,0.97,4440.536,4445.274,I am not Privy to any major American city that is having that experience.,104,,
575,0.97,4445.274,4454.016,I think there is generally an understanding in the media and particularly in our local media that this is a unique Seattle problem.,104,,
576,0.97,4454.016,4469.064,"Beyond that, I think there is an understanding that this is a unique West Coast problem, Portland.",104,,
577,0.97,4469.064,4480.609,"There is an article from Dallas news discussing in Texas, discussing that in the same period they hired 80 officers, they lost 140 officers.",104,,
578,0.97,4480.609,4487.249,"In the same period that they hired 150 officers, they lost 204 officers.",104,,
579,0.97,4487.249,4492.921,It's projected that that trend will continue the next two years for the Dallas police Department.,104,,
580,0.97,4492.921,4499.695,I bring that to raise that nationally police departments are having a difficult time hiring and retaining police.,104,,
581,0.97,4499.695,4509.571,"I would be interested in hearing from people observing this, examples from major cities that can attract and retain police and what they are doing.",104,,
582,0.97,4509.571,4512.908,That's all I'm putting out there.,104,,
583,0.97,4512.908,4536.465,I really appreciate the work of the human services Department in responding to the Sligh in the first quarter of the year and I appreciate having the information to inform our decisions but I want to make sure that we are not so limited that we are debating the efficacy of hiring incentives as a strategy to realize the 125 officer hiring goal.,104,,
584,0.97,4536.465,4559.321,And I think it would be interesting to see examples of other jurisdictions and some of the other things that they are doing in addition to hiring incentives to make that up in cities that are outpacing--where hiring is outpacing attrition.,104,,
585,0.97,4559.321,4571.199,"I wanted to say that in anticipation of our next meeting if folks are watching and coming with information, it would be interesting to hear the other strategies.",104,,
586,0.97,4571.199,4574.202,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Lewis.",105,,
587,0.97,4574.202,4576.071,"Keith, did you have a response to that?",105,,
588,0.97,4576.071,4577.639,I did.,106,,
589,0.97,4577.639,4578.774,Thank you for that information.,106,,
590,0.97,4578.774,4583.011,I think that is important to bring in.,106,,
591,0.97,4583.011,4593.855,"As a recruiter, I think objective, like when I'm doing my job, look for talent, doesn't matter what Department they are in.",106,,
592,0.97,4593.855,4601.596,My job across the city making sure that all of the departments are Strafford and taken care of.,106,,
593,0.97,4601.596,4602.13,Trends are important.,106,,
594,0.97,4602.13,4606.535,I look at the trends.,106,,
595,0.97,4606.535,4616.144,"There are great friends at SPD--not SPD but paid time off, flexible schedules.",106,,
596,0.97,4616.144,4619.815,I mentioned about recruitment.,106,,
597,0.97,4619.815,4627.456,"Providing extra resources for the Recruiters within SPD and having three, four pockets or five pockets that are dedicated to outreach.",106,,
598,0.97,4627.456,4631.126,I know the gentleman that does the recruiting there right now.,106,,
599,0.97,4631.126,4641.97,He does this by himself and he takes officers with him but literally he is driving across the state.,106,,
600,0.97,4641.97,4647.976,It's those little things but resources that departments need and Recruiters need that.,106,,
601,0.97,4647.976,4650.245,If we can build those teams.,106,,
602,0.97,4650.245,4658.086,We can mobilize and go to outside the state or Eastern Washington or go to down to--whatever it is.,106,,
603,0.97,4658.086,4660.455,But to bring that talent here.,106,,
604,0.97,4660.455,4666.161,But you can't just do it alone or on somebody's back.,106,,
605,0.97,4666.161,4667.295,You need team effort.,106,,
606,0.97,4667.295,4677.105,"There are different ways to do this, Councilmember Lewis, you brought up great points Besides the hiring incentives.",106,,
607,0.97,4677.105,4683.211,"Other benefits would be--flexible schedules or paid time off, travel incentives, something like that.",106,,
608,0.97,4683.211,4691.82,I know it would have to be bargained but there are different things as far as departments are doing to be creative.,106,,
609,0.97,4691.82,4692.12,Thank you.,106,,
610,0.97,4692.12,4696.024,Can I do a follow-up real quick.,107,,
611,0.97,4696.024,4696.324,Quickly.,108,,
612,0.97,4696.324,4698.827,We are way pasted time for this item.,108,,
613,0.97,4698.827,4702.13,This was not intended to be a deep dive.,108,,
614,0.97,4702.13,4707.636,Only on this report and we have our Council members in the Queue.,108,,
615,0.97,4707.636,4708.437,I understand.,109,,
616,0.97,4708.437,4719.781,"In response to Keith's response, that was a great response about how we can maybe take a step back and look more Holistically on what we are trying to do.",109,,
617,0.97,4719.781,4731.226,Less a follow-up question an more under lining I think this conversation gets more productive when we are not incentive bonus or not incentive bonus.,109,,
618,0.97,4731.226,4742.704,When it's more like how do we realize 125 person hiring class and let's put everything on the table including the bonus discussions.,109,,

677,0.97,5153.781,5166.561,"Since we last presented to the Council, we have made progress on the project and we will highlight some of these progresses today during the presentation.",119,,
678,0.97,5166.561,5172.8,One thing that has changed is the development of a set of organizational values.,119,,
679,0.97,5172.8,5177.805,"So, what happened here is that our judges and court staff worked together.",119,,
680,0.97,5177.805,5181.342,We identified and we built a shared commitment to the court's values.,119,,
681,0.97,5181.342,5185.88,We came up with the six values that are listed here.,119,,

686,0.97,5208.503,5208.87,Thank you.,120,,
687,0.97,5208.87,5219.18,Good morning and thank you for the opportunity for me to share a little bit about what is happening in our probation division.,120,,
688,0.97,5219.18,5230.258,Before I really update you on where we are with the probation evolution project I want to share how probation works at Seattle municipal court.,120,,
689,0.97,5230.258,5237.899,Probation is post add Judd indication option that the judges use.,120,,
690,0.97,5237.899,5239.934,It's a case management program.,120,,
691,0.97,5239.934,5246.541,Judges have the opportunity to implement probation at sentencing.,120,,
692,0.97,5246.541,5253.848,They will order several obligations or have a menu of several obligations to select from.,120,,
693,0.97,5253.848,5266.127,"They are often negotiated through agreed orders or plea agreement between the city attorney, the office of public defense or private defense attorney and the client.",120,,
694,0.97,5266.127,5278.906,"For example, someone who committed a domestic violence offense may agree to participate in a domestic violence intervention program commonly known as our Dvip program.",120,,
695,0.97,5278.906,5284.345,Many of you Councilmembers are aware of that.,120,,
696,0.97,5284.345,5291.085,"With this, probation counselors rarely have an opportunity to weigh in on what sentencing obligations look like.",120,,
697,0.97,5291.085,5301.429,Sometimes judges do call for a Presentence report to support the gathering and information on what a client's background may look like.,120,,
698,0.97,5301.429,5318.579,"Once a person is ordered to probation, the probation counselor's role is to support the client in ensuring that they successfully complete the court ordered obligations.",120,,
699,0.97,5318.579,5331.125,"Self identified goals and with goals, just really Transitioning them off of or out of the criminal legal system.",120,,
700,0.97,5331.125,5340.735,Judge Gregory will share a bit about the probation evolution project.,120,,
701,0.97,5340.735,5345.506,In 2020 we began Redesigning our approach to probation.,121,,
702,0.97,5345.506,5363.491,"We talked to our Stakeholders and community feedback and we wanted to--we talked about this to the Council before, eliminate Disproportional impact on those that we serve, especially at the probation level.",121,,
703,0.97,5363.491,5375.603,We incorporated the findings and recommendations of the Vera Institute assessment as well as the 2021 city audit concerning our probation Department.,121,,
704,0.97,5375.603,5390.952,"Over the past several months, we spent time assuring that the effort we made was Resourced appropriately and we wanted to come with a clear unified vision backed by the shared commitment of our judges.",121,,
705,0.97,5390.952,5398.493,We have probation evolution project manager that led our team to develop the following goal statement for the project.,121,,
706,0.97,5398.493,5401.262,It's listed in the power point.,121,,
707,0.97,5401.262,5420.681,"Basically to Transfor our probation and services division stepping away from traditional Incarceration, reactionary approaches toward one that is hopeful, equitable for the people before us and support the client and their success and growth.",121,,
708,0.97,5420.681,5429.524,We will be working in the coming months to complete important vision work around the future of our probation Department at Seattle municipal court.,121,,
709,0.97,5429.524,5440.902,We want to make sure that the way that we go and the journey that we take and the--achieve our goals and what we are doing in Seattle municipal court.,121,,
710,0.97,5440.902,5442.436,We learned a lot.,122,,
711,0.97,5442.436,5451.979,Keep on learning and keep listening to make probation work for the people that come in to our probation Department and the people that need services.,122,,
712,0.97,5451.979,5458.986,We want to improve our engagement with our clients so that clients can get better outcomes.,122,,
713,0.97,5458.986,5465.693,"So, Carol, what changed in regards to the probation Departmnt so far?",122,,
714,0.97,5465.693,5478.105,"Great, so, notable changes that we made in the probation program so far is first we are focusing on probation on high risk sites.",123,,
715,0.97,5478.105,5483.644,Judges maintain the discretion on the cases they refer.,123,,
716,0.97,5483.644,5487.815,"Clients referred have cases like Dui, Dv or mental health.",123,,
717,0.97,5487.815,5493.421,We discontinued the practice of monitoring cases for criminal law violation checks only.,123,,
718,0.97,5493.421,5509.604,This applies to all case types with the exception of Dui cases where an Iid monitoring obligation has been implemented in that mandate.,123,,
719,0.97,5509.604,5518.713,"As early 2021, this policy reduced the caseload by 78%.",123,,
720,0.97,5518.713,5524.952,"So that 1,640 less clients being supervised by Seattle municipal court --",123,,
721,0.97,5524.952,5533.027,Can you say the percentage again?,124,,
722,0.97,5533.027,5544.572,"In September 2020, is many of you are aware that our judges voted to eliminate all discretionary probation fines and fees.",125,,
723,0.97,5544.572,5549.777,This eliminated the probation supervision fee and records check fee among others.,125,,
724,0.97,5549.777,5559.02,The fees were often waived by judges as they consider what the client's full financial situation was.,125,,
725,0.97,5559.02,5569.63,But when they were imposed they often totaled from $600 to $240 a person.,125,,
726,0.97,5569.63,5573.868,The judges approved a close closure policy.,125,,
727,0.97,5573.868,5584.145,This allows for the counselors to close out clients from probation monitoring once they have completed the court ordered condition without having any formal action by the court.,125,,
728,0.97,5584.145,5599.827,This is the area that we really identified as a bottleneck in our auditing when it was happening and it resulted in cases being held on longer that it needed to be.,125,,
729,0.97,5599.827,5612.006,"After this policy was implemented, the number of clients on active supervision was reduced by 16%.",125,,
730,0.97,5612.006,5615.943,We started collecting client reported race and Ethnicity data.,125,,
731,0.97,5615.943,5621.549,This was highlighted in the at disaster that came out as well.,125,,
732,0.97,5621.549,5626.454,The court previously relied on demographic data provided by law enforcement.,125,,
733,0.97,5626.454,5637.965,"With this improved data, it will allow us to better understand the outcomes for different groups and address disproportionate impact.",125,,
734,0.97,5637.965,5639.433,We have a client exit survey.,125,,
735,0.97,5639.433,5656.751,"One I would like to highlight is something that we came out in December, 74% of the people that took the survey agreed that their counselor had a positive influence on them.",125,,
736,0.97,5656.751,5661.322,We are seeing positive early results in the performance data published on our Website.,125,,
737,0.97,5661.322,5665.059,"You can check that out, we keep it up to date.",125,,
738,0.97,5665.059,5671.599,In 2021 we saw a significant improvement in the rates that client were completing probation.,125,,
739,0.97,5671.599,5690.985,We can give more information to you about that either later on or in further conversations with you all as we do meet with you all throughout the year.,125,,
740,0.97,5690.985,5693.12,I want to share specifics for 2022.,125,,
741,0.97,5693.12,5696.991,We are early in the year.,125,,
742,0.97,5696.991,5704.532,"As judge Gregory mentioned, we hired a probation evolution project manager.",125,,
743,0.97,5704.532,5708.369,She is serving as the organizational change manager for this project.,125,,
744,0.97,5708.369,5718.946,We found it necessary to have a staff person whose primary focus is to drive this work product.,125,,
745,0.97,5718.946,5722.55,Other managers reassuring operations and other work continues.,125,,
746,0.97,5722.55,5732.96,She helped us get a line around the remaining work to be done and develop a project schedule.,125,,
747,0.97,5732.96,5738.432,We are excited to have her here.,125,,
748,0.97,5738.432,5745.773,We also have a division wide training calendar.,125,,
749,0.97,5745.773,5748.576,It will include trauma responsive care.,125,,
750,0.97,5748.576,5751.746,It's targeted to be completed by July of this year.,125,,
751,0.97,5751.746,5764.959,Many of you also received notification from presiding juke Gregory about the decision to eliminate risk assessment tool for determining probation clients reporting frequency.,125,,
752,0.97,5764.959,5770.231,This will will be talked about in detail in the upcoming slides.,125,,
753,0.97,5770.231,5787.615,We have made a couple of other new hires that we would like to highlight though not specifically tied to the probation evolution project but their work supports some of the efforts that we have moving forward in this specifically and throughout the court.,125,,
754,0.97,5787.615,5799.426,We we come Victor Yale Moreland as community outreach and engagement strategy adviser and we welcome our community resource center system's navigator.,125,,
755,0.97,5799.426,5808.469,This is a contracted position that we have with the Ywca and something that you all permanently funded in the 2022 budget.,125,,
756,0.97,5808.469,5814.408,"So, we are excited to have what come to fruition.",125,,
757,0.97,5814.408,5815.676,She joined us a week ago.,125,,
758,0.97,5815.676,5826.82,Now I will turn it back over no judge Gregory who will talk about the why in eliminating assessment tool.,125,,
759,0.97,5826.82,5827.354,"Thank you, Carol.",126,,
760,0.97,5827.354,5837.765,Risk assessment tools are used in many courts to address the risk of a human's implicit bias in decision making.,127,,
761,0.97,5837.765,5846.64,"However, we found that these tools often include questions or considered factors that Perpetrate bias toward people of color.",127,,
762,0.97,5846.64,5859.353,"Effective March 21st of this year, I directed the probation service staff to eliminate the risk assessment tools for determining Probationary clients frequency.",127,,
763,0.97,5859.353,5870.864,"This is based on research on these tools in other jurisdictions, community feedback and the concerns that we had with the court's existing risk assessment tool.",127,,
764,0.97,5870.864,5890.918,"The Court's risk assessment tool was found to be failing and did not differentiate between risk Delves and was shown to have adverse effects on black people, African- Americans, American Indian and Alaskan native clients.",127,,
765,0.97,5890.918,5899.159,"So, probation is required by court rule to use a standardized classification system to determine people's community risk levels.",127,,
766,0.97,5899.159,5913.24,"That is what the minimum of monthly face to face interviews required to be had by probation with the person who is classified at a higher level, the highest level.",127,,
767,0.97,5913.24,5926.053,"Therefore, I have directed the court via the probation and services Department to create and implement a new standardized classification system.",127,,
768,0.97,5926.053,5933.894,I will have Carol talk to you about the development of that new system.,127,,
769,0.97,5933.894,5941.902,We have policy where all probation clients report to probation one time per month.,128,,
770,0.97,5941.902,5950.644,"Due to Covid operations, we currently have been reporting via phone or Video call.",128,,
771,0.97,5950.644,5959.72,"We are beginning our efforts to develop in the beginning, looking at the efforts to develop a standardized classification.",128,,
772,0.97,5959.72,5965.559,We are looking at the court rule Rlj 11.2.,128,,
773,0.97,5965.559,5979.873,"This system will be developed in partnership with community members and legal system partners actively talking to different Stakeholders in the community and talking to the city attorney's office, Dpd and other entities.",128,,
774,0.97,5979.873,5983.344,We don't know what the system will look like yet.,128,,
775,0.97,5983.344,5999.626,"We will need to rely on the expertise from committee members and our partners to ensure that it's equitable, free from bias and effectively identifies client's needs and risk factors.",128,,
776,0.97,5999.626,6011.138,We will be using a race and tool kit as part of the design process and target completion date is June 2022.,128,,
777,0.97,6011.138,6020.014,So you will hear more from us about that.,128,,
778,0.97,6020.014,6030.891,"So, also, for the next couple of months, most of our focus for the larger program plan will be on the new classification system.",128,,
779,0.97,6030.891,6034.628,We are working on the community engagement strategy in designing that.,128,,
780,0.97,6034.628,6042.603,We have talked to partners such as Socr and Vita agency.,128,,
781,0.97,6042.603,6051.979,We will complete a race and equity tool kit to uncover and mitigate any unintended impacts to at risk communities.,128,,
782,0.97,6051.979,6060.921,Once we developed the system we have to monitor the intake policies and processes and train staff on this new system.,128,,
783,0.97,6060.921,6074.001,Staff will be taking in additional training called equity to action and focuses on implicit bias before the new system launches.,128,,
784,0.97,6074.001,6082.342,When the classification system is implemented we will focus on developing goal based supervision policies.,128,,
785,0.97,6082.342,6086.613,This will be focused on those that pose a high risk to public safety.,128,,
786,0.97,6086.613,6096.59,We hope to have new supervision policies implemented and counselors trained on the new policies later in the fall.,128,,
787,0.97,6096.59,6109.87,In early 2023 the project will focus on designing positive reinforcement and Inten incentives to those on probation and encourage people to achieve the goals.,128,,
788,0.97,6109.87,6125.085,The project is to move away from traditional Incar Sertive reactionary approaches to supervision and a model more hopeful and clients success and growth.,128,,

790,0.97,6129.723,6138.165,We have to make sure that we are not causing any Unintentional harm and we achieve the goals that we set out to achieve.,128,,
791,0.97,6138.165,6139.766,You will hear more from this.,128,,
792,0.97,6139.766,6147.508,We will post some of these things Online on the web page as well.,128,,
793,0.97,6147.508,6171.999,"If I may, as you can see, what we are really trying to do is make sure that systemic racism found in the court system, that we can do what we can to erase that and make sure that a person when they come in the courthouse, that they are being treated in an equitable fashion and that we address the reason why the person came in the courthouse in the first place.",129,,
794,0.97,6171.999,6174.434,That is the end of our presentation.,129,,
795,0.97,6174.434,6177.07,We will address any questions that Council has.,129,,
796,0.97,6177.07,6181.275,Thank you for allowing us to present to you the probation evolution process.,129,,
797,0.97,6181.275,6183.11,Thank you so much.,130,,
798,0.97,6183.11,6207.201,"I can't tell you--I can't say how much I appreciate the court taking on this work after the Vera report, auditor recommendations focused on transforming how the city requires probation and manages probation for those that it does require.",130,,
799,0.97,6207.201,6237.497,"I feel like over the last several years you have gone above and beyond what I was hoping out of the recommendations and I can't tell you how pleased I was when I saw the announcement a couple of weeks ago around your decision, Judge Gregory on risk assessment pool.",130,,
800,0.97,6237.497,6267.694,"As you stated in your opening remarks the risk assessment tool is designed to be objective, to address the bias that individuals have in making decisions on whether or not people should have probation and the length of probation but it turns out that the actual I am puts to the tool itself Replicate some of the institutional biases of our system.",130,,
801,0.97,6267.694,6292.452,"So, really feel like you are leading the court in important work to address these issues that result--if Unaddressed have a result of perpetuating the disparate impacts and out comes for people in the criminal legal system.",130,,
802,0.97,6292.452,6306.767,"I also want to--even though it's old news, as much September 2020 but I want to thank you again for eliminating when the discretionary probation fees as it relates to work that is coming up soon.",130,,
803,0.97,6306.767,6315.876,"I know that there are other fines and fees not related to the probation program, some are mandated by the state.",130,,
804,0.97,6315.876,6316.476,Some are not.,130,,
805,0.97,6316.476,6325.886,I know that the court will be bringing us a report at the end of July to look at the ones that are not mandated by the state.,130,,
806,0.97,6325.886,6354.147,But I think that some of the state legislation that passed this session on legal financial obligations and creating more flexibility for people to have payment programs or have legal or financial obligations waived when previously they were required by the state might allow us to do more work in this area.,130,,
807,0.97,6354.147,6384.978,Just I want to really view my Marty felt thanks for the--heartfelt thanks for the work you are doing in this area and you are so steadfast in Partnering with community and using their experience and expertise in designing these new versions of your programs moving forward.,130,,
808,0.97,6384.978,6389.316,Just looking to any questions or comments from my colleagues.,130,,
809,0.97,6389.316,6390.217,Council member Lewis.,130,,
810,0.97,6390.217,6392.919,"Thank you so much, Madam chair.",131,,
811,0.97,6392.919,6396.423,Judge Gregory and team thank you so much.,131,,
812,0.97,6396.423,6401.528,Echo all the sentiments that chair Herbold related.,131,,
813,0.97,6401.528,6417.978,It's great to work with an institution like the court that is such a Proactive and passionate partner in this work of undoing the systemic Harms Inacademic to the criminal legal system.,131,,
814,0.97,6417.978,6466.893,"I wanted to ask, given that through a lot of these probation reforms, you have exit surveys, collecting data from the people moving through probation, I think one of the biggest flaws in a lot of the work that is done in the criminal legal system is not soliciting significant feedback from people impacted in terms of what the core underlying Insecurities relating to systems of reside Di advising and coming back in the court, not getting feedback on the underlying needs is one of the things that the system struggles with and not listening to those voices.",131,,
815,0.97,6466.893,6484.444,"I wonder if you might share based on the information that you are gathering, where some of the biggest problems that are leading people to Reoffend and be on the caseload of probation?",131,,
816,0.97,6484.444,6509.402,"From my point of view not having access to services, access to housing, access to jobs, just from a--mental health Court judge and a judge on the bench for 11 years, that's what I see, a lot of inequality and the system in and of itself for unemployment and services and housing.",132,,
817,0.97,6509.402,6527.053,"People don't have a chance to get themselves up, services and it's hard for a person to be able to stop doing what they have been doing in society.",132,,
818,0.97,6527.053,6535.862,"I echo what judge Gregory said in terms of the access to services and housing, Liveable wages.",133,,
819,0.97,6535.862,6570.964,"One of the things that we are trying to do in looking at the totality of the client in Transitioning them out of the system is offering things like through the resource center that we have here to help them to transition off probation and still have supportive services in the community, so somebody is coming in and they have to be supported by medication because they have mental health issues or something like that or they have treatment needs that go beyond a lot of people that have substance abuse issues.",133,,
820,0.97,6570.964,6574.267,It would extend beyond the term of pray additional probation.,133,,
821,0.97,6574.267,6609.402,"One thing that is important is to have the access to community support or when a person comes out of custody, it's important for if a person has to access mental health Meds in custody, have either the medication with them when they are Transitioning out of the institution or to have ready access to a provider when they are coming out so they ensure that they stay on the medication or in they are having the--the person having access to medically assisted treatment while they are in custody.",133,,
822,0.97,6609.402,6616.176,Some people don't--aren't prepared to enter into a program when they are out originally.,133,,
823,0.97,6616.176,6624.317,Maybe if they had access when they were in custody then have the supportive service set up for them immediately upon release.,133,,
824,0.97,6624.317,6639.532,"As we partner with the different facets of the system, we are hoping to build out some of those opportunities to ensure that somebody has gained the stability they need and don't come back.",133,,
825,0.97,6639.532,6641.768,Thank you.,134,,
826,0.97,6641.768,6642.769,I appreciate those responses.,134,,
827,0.97,6642.769,6656.182,"It underscores that when we were not investing in housing and service oriented interventions, it's not like we as a city are saving any money.",134,,
828,0.97,6656.182,6663.456,Like that caseload just gets put on the criminal legal system and ends up costing us a lot more.,134,,
829,0.97,6663.456,6673.7,I think this is good important work from a lot of the reforms that the court is doing to really emphasize how people can be set up for success.,134,,
830,0.97,6673.7,6679.005,I think that data and information about housing instability is a big factor and useful for us.,134,,
831,0.97,6679.005,6683.209,Thank you so much.,134,,
832,0.97,6683.209,6684.544,Thank you.,135,,
833,0.97,6684.544,6701.061,It's not just about how to--examining how we make decisions about people's risk but about how do we make different decisions by supporting the things that people need when they are released from custody.,136,,
834,0.97,6701.061,6735.428,"The way that we allow ourselves to make different decisions, once we address the institutional biases, once we can allow ourselves to make more equitable decisions further reducing disparity when we invest in the things that help people when they are released and really appreciate, again, you are going--reaching beyond just the four corners of the court in doing this work.",136,,
835,0.97,6735.428,6758.985,And I think it is going to provide real benefits to the broader community and look forward to doing more work with you on that.,136,,
836,0.97,6758.985,6761.821,Any other questions from my colleagues?,136,,
837,0.97,6761.821,6764.524,I want to make a statement.,137,,

840,0.97,6770.73,6776.569,I couldn't have done any of this without my team program services team and core team.,137,,
841,0.97,6776.569,6780.874,During the pandemic as you know we are working hard across the street at the court.,137,,
842,0.97,6780.874,6783.309,We had to close for a few days.,137,,
843,0.97,6783.309,6787.313,"Beyond that, my staff is working hard and I'm proud of my staff and team.",137,,
844,0.97,6787.313,6793.186,"Again, I do want to give a shout out to them.",137,,
845,0.97,6793.186,6798.091,We all want to make it a better court to people.,137,,
846,0.97,6798.091,6799.626,I thank my team.,137,,

848,0.97,6804.13,6813.306,"Yes, many thanks to everybody who made this possible both within the court and also 9 community Stakeholders who you have been engaged with.",138,,
849,0.97,6813.306,6842.769,"We look forward to having you back if not before July, definitely in late July, early August to get the report on the fees and fines imposed on court involved individuals and the Disproportionality study for those fines recognizing that you have eliminating many discretionary fees.",138,,

851,0.97,6843.503,6844.504,Thank you.,140,,

856,0.97,6865.758,6878.671,In the budget the Council requested that the police Department report on the activities of officers that serve on a number of enter jurisdictional task forces.,143,,
857,0.97,6878.671,6881.808,We are joined by enter Rupe chief Diaz.,143,,
858,0.97,6881.808,6883.209,Thank you for joining us.,143,,
859,0.97,6883.209,6909.469,"I will pass it on to provide a brief background about the item and wanted to reiterate a comment I made at the start of the meeting that among the other things, this work involves an important focus on gun violence and taking away guns from people who should not have them.",143,,
860,0.97,6909.469,6912.839,This morning--it is important reminder of this work.,143,,
861,0.97,6912.839,6913.773,Thank you so much.,143,,
862,0.97,6913.773,6915.208,I will pass it off.,143,,
863,0.97,6915.208,6917.71,"Thank you, Madam chair.",144,,
864,0.97,6917.71,6918.077,Good morning.,144,,
865,0.97,6918.077,6918.845,"Good morning, committee members.",144,,
866,0.97,6918.845,6927.82,I will note that we are joined by Angela Sochi the Finance director of SPD to tee up the item.,144,,
867,0.97,6927.82,6953.513,"Every year as Council member Herbold, the chair noted, SPD detectives work on task force to address issues of violent crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and sex resulted crimes, violent sex crimes within the region, agencies such as the FBI and DEA reimburse SPD for the cost it accrues doing the work.",144,,
868,0.97,6953.513,6958.818,Most of the work is done on overtime.,144,,
869,0.97,6958.818,6962.789,Each year SPD requests budget related overtime.,144,,
870,0.97,6962.789,6976.035,The requests are made in the year end supplemental so the Department can best calculate how much it needs to reimburse for the full year of task force activities.,144,,
871,0.97,6976.035,6979.305,"Last year about 323,000 on task force work.",144,,
872,0.97,6979.305,6989.749,"The Council on November 22, accepted the Federal funding in ordinance 126469 and then appropriated the funding in the year end supplemental.",144,,
873,0.97,6989.749,7000.326,"At the time, the counsel was reviewing the year end supplemental and 2022 adopted budget at the same time.",144,,
874,0.97,7000.326,7004.63,There was not enough time to review the work of the Tars force.,144,,
875,0.97,7004.63,7023.282,"So it was included in the 2022 adopted budget, statement of legislative intent SPD 18 a 001 that asked the Department to report back on the activities of five of the task forces on which they spend about $246,000 in 2021.",144,,
876,0.97,7023.282,7029.756,"So, today, you will hear a briefing from the Department on the work of those five task forces.",144,,
877,0.97,7029.756,7047.54,"Those are five of the ongoing regular task forces and the committee will, again, council will again see the task force reimbursement requests in the year end supplemental for 2022.",144,,
878,0.97,7047.54,7051.377,"So, council member Mosqueda --",144,,
879,0.97,7051.377,7056.215,"Thank you very much, Greg.",145,,
880,0.97,7056.215,7057.817,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",145,,
881,0.97,7057.817,7059.652,I wanted to add context to the why.,145,,
882,0.97,7059.652,7068.261,The outline today and the summary of what the process is is probably more elaborate at the time of the budget making.,145,,
883,0.97,7068.261,7077.57,We asked questions during budget deliberations this year and last year what the task forces were and information about what it included wasn't readily available.,145,,
884,0.97,7077.57,7088.514,"I think the reason is to pull back the layer on what is actually being discussed, who these task force are made up of and what the purpose of them is.",145,,
885,0.97,7088.514,7093.586,"Without having that information readily available to the Council, there was a big gasp in information.",145,,
886,0.97,7093.586,7098.157,When the work is being performed and we are asked to reimburse.,145,,
887,0.97,7098.157,7098.724,That was problematic.,145,,
888,0.97,7098.724,7112.405,"Starting from a place of knowing what the task force are, who is sitting at the table is a much more appropriate way to engage in budget deliberations at the end of the year instead of after the fact when we don't have the details.",145,,
889,0.97,7112.405,7125.351,"I appreciate this has been put forward and the good work to really understand what the task force are and the importance of some of the work, especially removing guns from the streets is important work.",145,,
890,0.97,7125.351,7142.768,"With that in mind in terms of good budgeting practice and greater transparency for members of the public, I appreciate that this slide was taken seriously and we have the foregoing forward.",145,,
891,0.97,7142.768,7143.669,Let's jump into it.,146,,
892,0.97,7143.669,7149.542,"Thank you for being with us, Angela.",146,,
893,0.97,7149.542,7150.51,Good morning.,147,,
894,0.97,7150.51,7155.348,The chief is otherwise engaged but I am more than happy to kick us off.,148,,
895,0.97,7155.348,7173.466,I will go ahead and share the slides here.,148,,
896,0.97,7176.369,7189.315,"As already noted, we were asked at the end of last year, part of 2022 budget process to provide further detail about our Federal task force partnerships.",148,,
897,0.97,7189.315,7202.562,There were specific task forces that were identified based on the reimbursement requests that we made in the supplemental budget process toward the end of the year.,148,,
898,0.97,7202.562,7209.869,This has been--historically we asked for reimbursement as Greg highlighted in his Intro.,148,,
899,0.97,7209.869,7221.48,"We asked for the reimbursement for the Federal task force over time, for hit or Miss years now.",148,,
900,0.97,7221.48,7240.7,Our Federal partners provide that overtime reimbursement to encourage the partnership with local and regional agencies where subject crimes they are cross jurisdictions or are better prosecuted at the Federal level.,148,,
901,0.97,7240.7,7262.588,"So, this is an important part of the investigative work that is done and as noted and as you can see in the report, typically these are high level crimes that are Impacting our most vulnerable--either in the form of human trafficking, drug trafficking.",148,,
902,0.97,7262.588,7267.56,Year not targeting low level crimes with this task force work.,148,,
903,0.97,7267.56,7270.096,That's important to note at the outset.,148,,
904,0.97,7270.096,7276.235,"For the first one here, is we have the FBI Street task force.",148,,
905,0.97,7276.235,7288.447,"The mission of this task force is partnership with the FBI and it involves SPD and other local agents, law enforcement agencies.",148,,
906,0.97,7288.447,7303.696,"It is to identify and target prosecution of criminal enterprise groups responsible for drug trafficking, money laundering, human trafficking, crimes of violence, robbery and violent street gangs.",148,,
907,0.97,7303.696,7317.376,"In 2021 we had two police detectives assigned, one from our gun violence reduction unit and another from our narcotics section to this work.",148,,
908,0.97,7317.376,7335.161,"Some of the out comes include 45 Federal indictments for trafficking weapons and money laundering, 150 Firearm seizures and a substantial amount of drug seizures as noticed on the slide.",148,,
909,0.97,7335.161,7349.975,Included in our response was some of the sentencing out comes and I believe some of the prosecution is still taking place for this particular item.,148,,
910,0.97,7349.975,7359.585,Next up we have the FBI violent gang task force.,148,,
911,0.97,7359.585,7362.922,This is in partnership with FBI.,148,,
912,0.97,7362.922,7366.625,We had two robbery unit detectives assigned to this work.,148,,

928,0.97,7462.254,7466.959,"Thank you, chair Herbold and having me present on the Federal task force work.",155,,
929,0.97,7466.959,7489.281,I know it's valuable for the long-term investigations but the additional resources that we have been able to pull together and the staff at critical levels the task force allowed us to pull additional resources and overtime but with agents that are coming in from a variety of Federal agencies.,155,,
930,0.97,7489.281,7496.255,"As we get into the violent gang streets, many of these have different titles.",155,,
931,0.97,7496.255,7500.96,"So, I know that this can be sometimes confusing.",155,,
932,0.97,7500.96,7516.175,"So, what is the violent gang Street task force, Seattle sound regional task force or as you see the Acronyms Srctvf.",155,,
933,0.97,7516.175,7524.35,"We have two robbery detectives that are assisting this unit, on the task force.",155,,
934,0.97,7524.35,7535.961,And one of the unique highlights that this task force has done was in the three month period they did an investigation into suspects that targeted 40 pharmacies.,155,,
935,0.97,7535.961,7544.87,"32 of those robberies targeted one single company that had a total loss of $232,000 there.",155,,
936,0.97,7544.87,7551.443,"Was about 6,000 Oxycodone pills sold to Seattle teenagers.",155,,
937,0.97,7551.443,7568.193,"When you are putting Oxycodone in an indoor community and being able to identify some of the potential losses, they confiscated two handguns and two long guns associated with 11 of the arrests out of the case.",155,,
938,0.97,7568.193,7577.002,A huge wind that we were able to dismantle it in a short period of time.,155,,
939,0.97,7577.002,7582.374,As the highlight is noted we had a murder for hire on Federal indictment.,155,,
940,0.97,7582.374,7589.815,"We made 12 arrests for Bank robberies and, so, goes these are wins out of each of the units.",155,,
941,0.97,7589.815,7599.091,"We had an arrest for one of the suspects stealing a boat, threatening a Washington state ferry and assaulting a Federal agent.",155,,
942,0.97,7599.091,7611.904,"But I think overall, we just having two detectives that are able to participate as part of the larger task force, this does allow us to maximize the extra resources.",155,,
943,0.97,7611.904,7625.651,"Going into the next one, which is the homeland security investigation task force, this is on major public safety investigations.",155,,
944,0.97,7625.651,7640.032,"It focused on disrupting terrorists and Transnational criminal organizations and one of the things that I want to highlight is that this task force, for clarification, we do not engage in checking on people's immigration status.",155,,
945,0.97,7640.032,7643.402,We do not address immigration status as part of the task force.,155,,
946,0.97,7643.402,7645.537,There are so many different components of HSI.,155,,
947,0.97,7645.537,7654.646,One of the areas that we do is high intensity drug trafficking area task force.,155,,
948,0.97,7654.646,7661.253,We work together to make 66 arrests.,155,,

952,0.97,7674.933,7684.343,We noted in working with all the different agencies a bill could cause an Overdose.,155,,
953,0.97,7684.343,7690.983,"Imagine 880,000 pills that we recovered, enough to kill every person in the city of Seattle.",155,,
954,0.97,7690.983,7694.586,That is a substantial amount of work we have done.,155,,
955,0.97,7694.586,7696.922,Nine pill presses recovered out of this.,155,,
956,0.97,7696.922,7707.533,"Some of the suspects arrested for these 0 operations had criminal history of murder, rain and firearms in the Commission of drug trafficking.",155,,
957,0.97,7707.533,7727.119,"This is Long-Standing criminal activity, criminal enterprise work that is actual being stopped.",155,,
958,0.97,7743.535,7747.639,We initiated a third party investigation targeting money laundering.,155,,
959,0.97,7747.639,7757.783,"This led to arrest of money laundering focused on bank fraud, wire Freud and unlicensed services.",155,,
960,0.97,7757.783,7766.658,Good arrests that focus on how money sometimes is moved across state lines but sometimes across international lines.,155,,
961,0.97,7766.658,7775.434,One of the last ones is DEA high intensity drug trafficking areas.,155,,

966,0.97,7796.421,7798.824,Funded substance treatments and trauma as well.,155,,
967,0.97,7798.824,7813.539,"The DEA task force that is part of this, we have three different task force groups, 21, 22 and 23 each has a narcotic detective assigned to the farce force.",155,,

971,0.97,7825.984,7833.025,We know each of these task forces disrupted many organized groups that made a great impact on the community.,155,,
972,0.97,7833.025,7842.601,"As I mentioned before, the Federal partners reimburse SB for the overtime costs for the task force work.",155,,
973,0.97,7842.601,7857.249,Every year the Department requests budget revenues and we wait until the end of the year to have an accurate reflection of how much has been used by the detectives and then trying to see what we asked for reimbursement.,155,,
974,0.97,7857.249,7901.426,"As I continue to highlight the struggle with staffing, we are augmenting almost every shift but I note the amazing work from the specialty units involved in the arrests and many of these arrests not only address robbery and burglary . A pot shop robbery in West Seattle but was involved in a Takoma Homicide as well.",155,,
975,0.97,7901.426,7923.081,"These are parted of that support that we get, specialty units.",155,,
976,0.97,7937.496,7941.3,This is the third highest amount of guns recovered.,155,,
977,0.97,7941.3,7952.544,It's the highest amount of guns recovered in the last 55 months.,155,,

979,0.97,7954.446,7960.986,The highest we had in the last 12 month period is 156 firearms.,155,,
980,0.97,7960.986,7966.758,We are five off the highest level of the month.,155,,
981,0.97,7966.758,7970.028,What we are seeing is immense amount of guns on the street.,155,,
982,0.97,7970.028,7976.802,Many of these are recovered in some fashion through the task force that we have been a part of.,155,,
983,0.97,7976.802,7983.175,"I want to know, we recovered, President had talked about ghost guns.",155,,
984,0.97,7983.175,7992.484,We recovered 24 ghost guns this year alone compared to three that--during the same time period last year.,155,,
985,0.97,7992.484,7999.891,We are seeing an increase in the amount of ghost guns that are affecting and being used in our community.,155,,
986,0.97,7999.891,8011.403,"I the last two weeks we have had 26 SB linked any Van hits, national integrated ballistics where we test all of our Shell casings.",155,,
987,0.97,8011.403,8015.741,We had 26 hits in the last two weeks.,155,,
988,0.97,8015.741,8022.08,Nine are linked two incidents and out of those nine five guns have been recovered.,155,,
989,0.97,8022.08,8031.556,"Nine are linked to three incidents and so what I mean by that, they have been linked though three different shootings and two of those guns have been recovered.",155,,
990,0.97,8031.556,8035.727,Eight have been linked to four incidents.,155,,
991,0.97,8035.727,8052.477,"So, four different areas that of have experience off one gun and five guns have been recovered out of those eight linked incidents.",155,,
992,0.97,8052.477,8054.913,A lot of good work.,155,,
993,0.97,8054.913,8057.416,But March isn't different than the first two months.,155,,
994,0.97,8057.416,8066.391,"We see increase in crimes from shootings to motor vehicle theft to larceny, vehicle assault and robbery.",155,,
995,0.97,8066.391,8069.561,We continue to make arrests.,155,,
996,0.97,8069.561,8072.998,We made the arrest in the pot shop robbery.,155,,
997,0.97,8072.998,8081.106,This is some of the highlighted work that we wanted to do for this public safety committee as well.,155,,
998,0.97,8081.106,8081.473,Any questions?,155,,
999,0.97,8081.473,8086.378,I do have a quick question.,156,,
1000,0.97,8086.378,8098.423,We know from national studies that purchases of guns have spiked.,156,,
1001,0.97,8098.423,8109.701,One in five people that bought guns in 2021 are first time gun owners.,156,,
1002,0.97,8109.701,8119.544,"Wondering, so, we see a huge Uptick in the purchase of guns.",156,,
1003,0.97,8119.544,8127.519,Are the ghost guns included since it's not data that you would get from gun sales or gun stores?,156,,
1004,0.97,8127.519,8131.523,I suspect that they may not be in those studies?,156,,
1005,0.97,8131.523,8134.126,Ghost guns are unique.,157,,
1006,0.97,8134.126,8138.53,Some can be made on 3-D printers.,157,,
1007,0.97,8138.53,8144.836,They are Downloading the software that figures out how to create a frame.,157,,
1008,0.97,8144.836,8152.077,"So, there is that piece that would not--you would not be able to track on gun sales.",157,,
1009,0.97,8152.077,8164.723,And then there she some ghost gun manufacturers which are--the President did highlight that they are trying to regulate and those that don't have serial numbers associated with these ghost guns.,157,,
1010,0.97,8164.723,8173.431,"So, the frames that are being done and then people are putting President pieces together to make a full functioning ghost gun.",157,,
1011,0.97,8173.431,8185.544,"So, some of that could potentially be tracked as far as sales from the manufacturer but that is very, very difficult and not at our level.",157,,
1012,0.97,8185.544,8189.714,We would work with ATF to do some of that regulation on it.,157,,
1013,0.97,8189.714,8203.295,A couple of years we did a trace data report that does track a lot of gun purchases and when we recover guns and where are they being purchased from.,157,,
1014,0.97,8203.295,8212.037,Focusing on the Federal Firearm licenses but ghost guns do not typically fit within that function.,157,,
1015,0.97,8212.037,8238.597,"So, I think high level we see national reports of large increases of sales over previous years of sales of guns and it does not fully capture the increase over previous years with the advance of ghost gun technology.",158,,
1016,0.97,8238.597,8241.433,Council member Mosqueda.,158,,
1017,0.97,8241.433,8241.766,Thank you.,159,,
1018,0.97,8241.766,8244.936,I do--thank you for being here.,159,,
1019,0.97,8244.936,8247.272,I appreciate again the response to the slide here.,159,,
1020,0.97,8247.272,8252.677,I have a question about the definition of violent gang.,159,,
1021,0.97,8252.677,8266.491,"I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit more about what constitutes a gang, how that is being defined and the reason I'm asking is because we talk a lot about increased violence across the country.",159,,
1022,0.97,8266.491,8272.43,That can mean a lot of different things depending on the community you come from.,159,,
1023,0.97,8272.43,8287.212,Under the Trump administration we saw a rise in white nationalists Fueling violence to many marginalized communities but they weren't classified as a gang traditionally.,159,,
1024,0.97,8287.212,8322.681,"Instead of being classified as domestic terrorism notably according to the ""Washington post"" analyst, the data compiled by the strategic and International studies since 2015, right wing Supreme may Sifts have been involved in 267 plots or attacks and 91 fatalities.",159,,
1025,0.97,8322.681,8331.69,The report goes on to state the number of all domestic terrorism white nationalist peaked in 2020.,159,,
1026,0.97,8331.69,8355.413,"Victims of all these incidents in recent years represent a broad cross section of communities including Jewish communities, black communities, Lgbtq individuals and other people of color who have been attacked by the right wing Supreme may Sifts wielding guns, knives, et cetera.",159,,
1027,0.97,8355.413,8386.378,"The insurrection in D.C. was not that long ago, just last year and with half a dozen SPD officers in D.C. at the time it's important Phos to continue to think about what we do locally and participating in the National conversations recognizing the impact is not just on individuals but mosques, black churches as well as abortion clinics and government buildings and increased threats of arson, gunfire and bombings across our country.",159,,
1028,0.97,8386.378,8410.835,"So, goes in the face of these very real and rising domestic terrorism attacks and threats, is this task for looking at the issue of domestic terrorism and if not, which of the task force that we sit on are we participating in and looking internally about how we address growing domestic terrorism?",159,,
1029,0.97,8410.835,8427.886,"Any of our task force if there is a nexus to the criminal behavior thank you noted, typically if it's involved in drug trafficking or trafficking of firearms, you are looking at white Supremacist groups could fit in the alignment.",160,,
1030,0.97,8427.886,8440.365,"If there is a level of behavior or practice that we are observing and noticing, these task force come in and are able to start working on the investigations.",160,,
1031,0.97,8440.365,8454.913,We have had not only domestic but also where we worked with FBI on a case where it was a domestic that hadn't gone International.,160,,
1032,0.97,8454.913,8458.016,"That was one case, a recent arrest about three months ago.",160,,
1033,0.97,8458.016,8463.555,We look at all the pieces of it.,160,,
1034,0.97,8463.555,8475.667,"Not only--it's hard--I think what I'm understanding, when we define a gang, it's the criminal behavior that is associated with the group.",160,,
1035,0.97,8475.667,8485.109,"So, there used to be definitions you could say four or mother people involved in criminal activity but it's the behavior that we are focused on.",160,,
1036,0.97,8485.109,8487.512,Are thy involved in drug trafficking?,160,,
1037,0.97,8487.512,8495.72,Are they involved in some level of using firearms to further their purpose?,160,,
1038,0.97,8495.72,8519.244,And this last--not this last one but one of the last ones I did testify on just having firearms present at rallies and at protests because we want to make sure that we do not have people using or pressuring people into the way they think.,160,,
1039,0.97,8519.244,8523.615,That is not necessarily part of the task force.,160,,
1040,0.97,8523.615,8528.92,When we look at the protest activity we have to be mindful as well.,160,,
1041,0.97,8528.92,8532.557,It looks like you have something to add?,161,,
1042,0.97,8532.557,8532.824,Yes.,162,,
1043,0.97,8532.824,8551.342,"One of the task forces that did not appear in this slide was the Puget sound joint terrorism task force that received about $21,000 of overtime reimbursement in 2021.",162,,
1044,0.97,8551.342,8560.852,That task force SPD detectives worked with FBI agents on international and domestic terrorist investigations.,162,,
1045,0.97,8560.852,8568.593,"So, that Council member may be falling into the camp that you are asking about.",162,,
1046,0.97,8568.593,8596.621,"I think the take away, chief Diaz, is that it says Street gangs, if it's an issue of illegal activity including domestic terrorism, including the presence of a group or four or more that have weapons including guns, white Supremists, domestic terrorism is part of maybe this task force on slide 2 as well as the task force that Greg spoke about?",163,,
1047,0.97,8596.621,8596.854,Yes.,164,,
1048,0.97,8596.854,8604.662,I believe in slide two it did note that it did focus on local or--let's see if I remember right.,164,,
1049,0.97,8604.662,8610.802,I want to make sure that I--one is criminal enterprise.,164,,
1050,0.97,8610.802,8627.752,"That would encompass everything from domestic to international and then we have the FBI homeland security one which was disrupted terrorists, exploitation of United States.",164,,
1051,0.97,8627.752,8630.154,They would fit in that.,164,,
1052,0.97,8630.154,8633.458,We have additional task force.,164,,
1053,0.97,8633.458,8646.037,"The one that dos mentioned is the one that did the investigation that I mentioned about three months ago, making an arrest on somebody that was domestic internally in the United States.",164,,
1054,0.97,8646.037,8660.284,"We have other task force that are associated with the Internet crimes and other different areas of policing as well, human trafficking, et cetera.",164,,
1055,0.97,8660.284,8661.085,Thank you.,165,,
1056,0.97,8661.085,8663.087,I appreciate you making the time.,165,,
1057,0.97,8663.087,8665.156,Yes do have one other item.,165,,
1058,0.97,8665.156,8669.127,I see you Council member Nelson.,165,,
1059,0.97,8669.127,8672.53,If you could have your questions follow the meeting and we can cover it.,165,,
1060,0.97,8672.53,8677.201,I do have one.,166,,
1061,0.97,8677.201,8680.571,This is kind of important.,166,,
1062,0.97,8680.571,8681.339,Councilmember Nelson.,167,,
1063,0.97,8681.339,8684.742,Thank you very much.,168,,
1064,0.97,8684.742,8701.659,The slide says it's the intend of Council to review the report and seek community input on the specific task force activities before determining appropriation authority that reimburses SPD for its work on the task forces.,168,,
1065,0.97,8701.659,8705.897,This has already been paid for by the Federal Government.,168,,
1066,0.97,8705.897,8710.268,"So, is that--are we going to do that?",168,,
1067,0.97,8710.268,8713.471,"I don't--anyway, that's my question.",168,,
1068,0.97,8713.471,8720.244,We have presented the slide report as intended.,169,,
1069,0.97,8720.244,8730.788,And it is well before the time where we are planning to receive the reimbursement request from the Department.,169,,
1070,0.97,8730.788,8740.965,And we will consider any feedback that we get from the public between now and that time.,169,,
1071,0.97,8740.965,8742.366,Council member Pedersen.,170,,
1072,0.97,8742.366,8742.834,Thank you.,171,,
1073,0.97,8742.834,8747.872,I want to thank everybody that called in about these items.,171,,
1074,0.97,8747.872,8751.709,Thank you chief Diaz and Angela for presenting.,171,,
1075,0.97,8751.709,8759.751,Appreciate the hard work of the tasks force and thank you Council member Mosqueda and providing the space to hear it.,171,,
1076,0.97,8759.751,8762.153,I know we are short on time here.,171,,
1077,0.97,8762.153,8764.856,While I was listening to public comments earlier.,171,,
1078,0.97,8764.856,8770.161,I was notified of two shootings in my district in the past 24 hours.,171,,
1079,0.97,8770.161,8772.897,Both incidents occurred in the wall inning Ford neighborhood.,171,,
1080,0.97,8772.897,8779.303,This is consistent with the citywide data that we got from SPD.,171,,
1081,0.97,8779.303,8780.438,Homicide events up 78%.,171,,
1082,0.97,8780.438,8784.041,Year to date shootings.,171,,
1083,0.97,8784.041,8790.248,Shots fired up 91%.,171,,
1084,0.97,8790.248,8790.681,Shootings up 164%.,171,,
1085,0.97,8790.681,8794.051,Seattle voters say they feel less safe than two years ago.,171,,
1086,0.97,8794.051,8811.702,One of the shootings was in an area of repeated criminal activity on North Lake way between gas Brooks park and I- 5. in Dices I asked chief Diaz to walk with me and small business owners.,171,,
1087,0.97,8811.702,8816.274,I want to thank the chief for seeing the ongoing problems.,171,,
1088,0.97,8816.274,8862.086,"But for constituents that have ongoing concerns about safety in that area and in light of the shooting this morning I have to ask the police chief was any of the work being used to address problems on North Lake way and if not, what more of the city's executive Department doing to address the escalating challenges on North Lake way and especially as we approach the summer months and events at gas works parks what is being done to address this.",171,,
1089,0.97,8862.086,8872.33,"During that walk, the city is focusing on the encampment issues that run along that street.",172,,
1090,0.97,8872.33,8885.309,The task force is not associated with this type of work.,172,,
1091,0.97,8885.309,8906.964,"Typically if there was sex trafficking, if we had specific cases, you could bring in components of the different task force, one that I had not focused on which was human trafficking, some of the human trafficking work that we are doing and in this case our task force are not associated with this.",172,,
1092,0.97,8906.964,8923.915,There is work that has to be done by the city when it comes to dealing with some of the encampment Rv issues because not all of it is resulting in more of a criminal enterprise case.,172,,
1093,0.97,8923.915,8932.323,"In this incident, witnesses did hear a verbal disturbance before the shots had running out.",172,,
1094,0.97,8932.323,8936.36,Officers did respond to the scene.,172,,
1095,0.97,8936.36,8948.205,Unfortunately we were unable to locate--we had a single gunshot victim but we were unable to locate the suspects in this case and we are still working on those investigations.,172,,
1096,0.97,8948.205,8953.477,[change of Captioners],172,,
1097,0.97,8971.529,9008.566,They are going to be talking to is more around enforcement of the parking for more than 72 hours given various court cases they have been working on how to address some of the limitations under those cases they will socialize some of their intentions with us I know several of us are having meetings about those efforts.,173,,
1098,0.97,9008.566,9027.818,We also know as PD has done a lot of really good work even at locations that are Encampments of people living outdoors in cases where there is illegal activity.,173,,
1099,0.97,9027.818,9042.166,Preying on individuals were living in Encampments that we have seen examples of also of Confiscation of drugs in tents.,173,,
1100,0.97,9042.166,9069.16,"There is this concern I think as Councilmember Lewis has raised on repeated occasions this concern that sometimes locations where people are living in sheltered, whether it is in tents or Rvs often used as ways to shield the unlawful activity that is happening within the camps.",173,,
1101,0.97,9069.16,9076.467,S PD does not--just because it is an Rv or a tent encampment.,173,,
1102,0.97,9076.467,9080.938,We will not address complaints of unlawful activity in those locations.,173,,
1103,0.97,9080.938,9084.842,That is not the policy of the police Department.,173,,
1104,0.97,9084.842,9100.958,I know many of us get constituent Emails from folks who have interpreted what they have heard from police officers as they will not investigate unlawful activity within these locations.,173,,
1105,0.97,9100.958,9111.001,That is not the case and there are many examples of SPD doing so in doing so effectively.,173,,
1106,0.97,9111.001,9115.005,I am trying to wrap this up so we can move on to the last item on our agenda.,173,,
1107,0.97,9115.005,9116.707,Councilmember Lewis you do have your hand up.,173,,
1108,0.97,9116.707,9117.708,I see that.,173,,
1109,0.97,9117.708,9123.013,I will Respectably make a point.,174,,
1110,0.97,9123.013,9133.023,As chief--has made on many occasions these issues with public safety applications--responses.,174,,
1111,0.97,9133.023,9155.713,"That is nothing to Denigrate the motivation of our officers in these environments but just to say that, you know we really also need to be focused on creating an environment conducive to natural occurring public safety and we have to encourage having a supper system that is primarily based in sanction Encampments is not a strategy conducive to that.",174,,
1112,0.97,9155.713,9176.033,I just hope for people that are watching we can continue to work on the strategy where we expand tiny House villages so we don't have Unsanctioned Encampments and less environments conducive to this criminal activity.,174,,
1113,0.97,9176.033,9176.634,Thank you .?,174,,
1114,0.97,9176.634,9177.001,Thank you.,174,,
1115,0.97,9177.001,9179.069,Thanks for being with us today.,175,,
1116,0.97,9179.069,9182.506,Please read agenda item number four.,175,,
1117,0.97,9182.506,9216.006,Counsel bill on 20294 relating work labor standard establishing compensation for update workers with minimum pay requirements and related standards for transparency and flexibility to that 01 25 and 6.208.020 adding a new title eight 8.37 to court for--discussion.,176,,
1118,0.97,9216.006,9217.274,Thank you so much.,177,,
1119,0.97,9217.274,9218.409,A couple very short introductory remarks.,177,,
1120,0.97,9218.409,9219.143,For the viewing public.,177,,
1121,0.97,9219.143,9224.215,We have been meeting with a large group of Stakeholders for nearly a year.,177,,
1122,0.97,9224.215,9229.853,It will be a year in June.,177,,
1123,0.97,9229.853,9232.456,1113 of these large Stakeholder meetings held.,177,,
1124,0.97,9232.456,9247.004,They have included a wide range of companies being affected by this legislation.,177,,
1125,0.97,9247.004,9275.899,-- workers and Council members and central staff in the office of labor standards and we have also had several--briefing items as we have been going along for the process to make sure committee members are familiar with many of the concepts related to issues and it is still related to minimum payment and flexibility issues.,177,,
1126,0.97,9275.899,9283.374,There will be future bills to address some of the other issues.,177,,
1127,0.97,9283.374,9295.352,Before I handed over to--to go over her presentation I do want to address a couple things in the committee.,177,,
1128,0.97,9295.352,9302.993,I've heard some folks suggest this is a One-Size-Fits-All approach to the different economies and that is not the case.,177,,
1129,0.97,9302.993,9316.073,This proposal recognizes there is a difference from On-Demand delivery companies and market based network companies we will learn more about that in a moment.,177,,
1130,0.97,9316.073,9356.413,Reference to a belief that the city should Commission a study to inform the policy from folks were skeptical that workers are making under a minimum wage and I just want to remind everybody when the city considered and passed similar legislation to protect transportation network companies there was a study by research and labor and employment and the University of Berkeley and they confirmed that workers were making significantly under minimum wage and after expenses workers were only making my dollars and $.73 an hour.,177,,
1131,0.97,9356.413,9365.889,I just want to flood those two issues and I will handed over to Emma Carter.,177,,
1132,0.97,9365.889,9366.09,Amy.,177,,
1133,0.97,9366.09,9369.893,Thank you chair--good afternoon Councilmembers.,178,,
1134,0.97,9369.893,9372.796,I'm going to share my screen.,178,,
1135,0.97,9372.796,9375.866,Can everybody see that?,178,,
1136,0.97,9375.866,9376.266,Okay.,178,,
1137,0.97,9376.266,9382.306,My name is Amy Gore.,178,,
1138,0.97,9382.306,9391.715,I am with counsel central staff joined by Mike colleague Jasmine--she may jump at the answer questions if needed.,178,,
1139,0.97,9391.715,9400.791,Today I have a presentation on counsel bill 120294 which would establish a minimum pay Standard and related regulations for outpaced workers.,178,,
1140,0.97,9400.791,9406.363,This presentation will give an overview of the legislation as well as outline some policy considerations for the committee.,178,,
1141,0.97,9406.363,9411.735,The committee has had three briefings on this legislation as it was developed.,178,,
1142,0.97,9411.735,9415.072,Most of the basics of the legislation will be familiar to you.,178,,
1143,0.97,9415.072,9433.357,Given the time I will try and go through this quickly while pointing out changes from the last committee discussion but I also want to make a couple points for folks who may be just starting to track the legislation now that it has been introduced so I really appreciate your patience.,178,,
1144,0.97,9433.357,9442.766,Network companies rely on a business model that based workers and the Pinna contractors.,178,,
1145,0.97,9442.766,9446.303,That means they are not covered by employment standards established by Federal and state and local laws.,178,,
1146,0.97,9446.303,9455.579,This legislation is one of a policy that the committee has been discussing under the umbrella term PAYOUT proposal.,178,,
1147,0.97,9455.579,9462.519,Which are intended to establish labor standards for these workers.,178,,
1148,0.97,9462.519,9467.124,The proposals include those listed on the slide.,178,,
1149,0.97,9467.124,9471.195,I won't go through because we have talked about them quite a lot.,178,,
1150,0.97,9471.195,9477.267,This bill counsel bill 120294 would address the first three of these policy goals.,178,,
1151,0.97,9477.267,9493.383,"It would establish a minimum pay standard set transparency requirements governing information that is shared with workers and customers in the city, and would establish flexibility standards that give workers more control over their work availability.",178,,
1152,0.97,9493.383,9508.966,"In addition it would require a notice of rights for workers, establish Recordkeeping requirements for network companies, prohibit Realiation, and authorize the office of labor standards to administer and enforce the requirements.",178,,
1153,0.97,9508.966,9517.574,The legislation in the package of policy proposals has been the subject of community engagement since June of 2021.,178,,
1154,0.97,9517.574,9527.15,It has been discussed on the committee three times prior to today.,178,,
1155,0.97,9527.15,9528.986,"The final bullet should say today's date, April 12.",178,,
1156,0.97,9528.986,9530.587,There was not a meeting on April 8th.,178,,
1157,0.97,9530.587,9533.657,Just in case that is confusing for anybody.,178,,
1158,0.97,9533.657,9537.06,The next several slides discussed the workers for the companies that are covered by the legislation.,178,,
1159,0.97,9537.06,9545.802,Covered workers would include Workes accepting offers to perform services for pain via network companies worker platform.,178,,
1160,0.97,9545.802,9552.709,"The legislation would not cover workers offering the sale of rental, sale or rental of goods or real estate.",178,,
1161,0.97,9552.709,9560.45,It does not include licensed professional services including creative work in Digital services.,178,,
1162,0.97,9560.45,9576.7,It's it does not include workers providing transportation services through taxis or tea and season it does not cover workers who meet the definition of employees of the network company or the customer.,178,,
1163,0.97,9576.7,9595.052,A covered company is any company that has 250 or more at based workers worldwide and use Online enabled applications or platforms to connect customers with workers or present offers to workers and facilitate the services.,178,,
1164,0.97,9595.052,9610.601,What is not covered is any company offering services that simply enable individuals to schedule appointments or process payments when the company does not engage in any additional Intermediation of the relationship between the customers of the workers.,178,,
1165,0.97,9610.601,9614.538,And does not provide oversight of the services that are provided.,178,,
1166,0.97,9614.538,9619.543,It also does not cover any companies operating Digital advertising and Messaging platforms.,178,,
1167,0.97,9619.543,9625.248,With there is not Intermediation of the relationship or oversight of the services provided.,178,,
1168,0.97,9625.248,9630.654,Similar to workers it does not cover taxis or transportation network companies.,178,,
1169,0.97,9630.654,9638.261,Either is defined by the city or as defined by the state.,178,,
1170,0.97,9638.261,9650.674,In addition to the definitions for covered companies as Councilmember--mentioned there are two types of network companies which are defined separately in the legislation and had different regulatory requirements.,178,,
1171,0.97,9650.674,9653.176,First is on demand network companies.,178,,
1172,0.97,9653.176,9659.816,These are network companies that primarily facilitate or present On-Demand offers.,178,,
1173,0.97,9659.816,9666.256,And On-Demand offer is one that must be initiated within two hours of acceptance.,178,,
1174,0.97,9666.256,9672.996,On-Demand companies can include those that facilitate delivery from eating and drinking establishments were grocery stores but are not necessarily limited in that way.,178,,
1175,0.97,9672.996,9677.434,Second we have marketplace network companies.,178,,
1176,0.97,9677.434,9679.67,These are networks companies that operate differently than other network companies.,178,,
1177,0.97,9679.67,9691.682,They facilitate Prescheduled offers where the company or customer in the worker exchange information and the details of the service and then agree to a Úprice for the services.,178,,
1178,0.97,9691.682,9697.554,"The company does not monitor the outpaced workers location, mileage, or time.",178,,
1179,0.97,9697.554,9709.166,And just to be clear a company that is not put the definition of a marketplace company or an On-Demand company can still be considered a network company and covered by the legislation.,178,,
1180,0.97,9709.166,9716.873,They are not intended to be mutually exclusive.,178,,
1181,0.97,9716.873,9720.31,The primary impact of the legislation would be the establishment of a minimum payment for outpaced workers.,178,,
1182,0.97,9720.31,9732.989,The goal of the minimum payment is to require that a network company either provide or ensure the customer provide both the payment of a minimum wage in addition to expenses that the at based worker is covering themselves.,178,,
1183,0.97,9732.989,9739.229,The minimum payment is calculated using two primary inputs.,178,,
1184,0.97,9739.229,9740.397,Engaged time and engaged miles.,178,,
1185,0.97,9740.397,9746.103,Engage time is the time to work or perform services for an offer.,178,,
1186,0.97,9746.103,9754.878,For marketplace network companies because time is not monitored by the company the engaged time is based on an estimate agreed upon before the offer is accepted.,178,,
1187,0.97,9754.878,9760.951,That is agreed upon by the customer and the worker.,178,,
1188,0.97,9760.951,9764.788,Engaged miles are those troubled by a worker during engaged time.,178,,
1189,0.97,9764.788,9778.268,"Because market place network companies do not track miles traveled engaged miles would not be, would not include any miles that are traveled when performing services facilitated by a marketplace network company.",178,,
1190,0.97,9778.268,9791.615,To go into a little more detail about engage time for On-Demand network companies or when an offer must be performed within two hours.,178,,
1191,0.97,9791.615,9797.087,Engaged time would begin when the offer is accepted and engaged time would and when the offer is completed or the offer is canceled by the company.,178,,
1192,0.97,9797.087,9800.323,The customer or the worker CANCELS the offer with cause.,178,,
1193,0.97,9800.323,9809.9,We will get into the conditions which an offer can be terminated with cause shortly.,178,,
1194,0.97,9809.9,9819.643,Engaged time is the time it will take to perform the offer.,178,,
1195,0.97,9819.643,9823.58,But for market place network companies would be estimated by the customer and worker prior to the offer acceptance.,178,,
1196,0.97,9823.58,9831.221,"Marketplace network companies engaged time can be both flexible, for example one hour in an eight hour amount of time or Non-Concurrent.",178,,
1197,0.97,9831.221,9840.797,For all other offers engaged time would start when the outpaced worker begins performance of the offer or reports to the assigned location.,178,,
1198,0.97,9840.797,9851.007,And then engage time ends when the performance is complete when the offer is canceled by the company or with a worker CANCELS with cause.,178,,
1199,0.97,9851.007,9861.251,This slide just summarizes the calculation of the minimum payment which is the permanent amount multiplied by engaged minutes plus the per mile amount multiplied by engaged miles.,178,,
1200,0.97,9861.251,9866.456,The next light I will go into a little bit more detail about the per minute amount and the per mile amount.,178,,
1201,0.97,9866.456,9874.998,"For the permanent amount it includes the minimum wage equivalent, which in 2022 is 28.8 cents.",178,,
1202,0.97,9874.998,9894.918,As well as an associated cost factor of 1.13 to cover Non- mileage expenses that are necessary to conduct at based work and associated time factor to cover the time that at based worker spent working or engaged with work without compensation.,178,,
1203,0.97,9894.918,9900.19,Therefore the total permitted amount is $.39.,178,,
1204,0.97,9900.19,9908.531,The per mile amount includes the standard mileage rate set by the IRS.,178,,
1205,0.97,9908.531,9909.132,58.5 cents per mile.,178,,
1206,0.97,9909.132,9914.204,As well as an associated mileage factor to cover miles traveled without Habitation.,178,,
1207,0.97,9914.204,9920.277,The legislation the per mile amount is initially set at 1.25.,178,,
1208,0.97,9920.277,9924.147,This results in a total per mile amount of $.73.,178,,
1209,0.97,9924.147,9932.789,As discussed the minimum wage equivalent for at based workers is based on our cities minimum wage for schedule one employers.,178,,
1210,0.97,9932.789,9947.337,That is defined in SMC chapter 14.19 and 2022 at 17.27 per hour which works out to about 28 point eight cents per minute.,178,,
1211,0.97,9947.337,9952.375,This slide Itemizes some of the types of costs to be covered by the associated cost factor.,178,,
1212,0.97,9952.375,9956.079,"Peer attacks, state paid medical leave, unemployment.",178,,
1213,0.97,9956.079,9970.994,"As noted before the legislation would set the associated cost factor at 1.13 initially and it would be adjustable by the Ols director, the office of labor standard director after three years.",178,,
1214,0.97,9970.994,9976.366,Though the director could not produce a below 1.13.,178,,
1215,0.97,9976.366,9983.039,"This slide, slide 18 Itemizes some of the cost to be covered by the associated time factor.",178,,
1216,0.97,9983.039,9984.474,Such as rest breaks and time reviewing offers.,178,,
1217,0.97,9984.474,9995.251,It includes time to become available for tasks and for administrative task related to the outpaced work.,178,,
1218,0.97,9995.251,10002.759,The legislation would allow the director of the office of labor standards to review and change the associated time factor but could not reduce it below 1.21.,178,,
1219,0.97,10002.759,10008.998,This slide Itemizes the cost to be covered by the associated mileage factor.,178,,
1220,0.97,10008.998,10017.807,Such is the expense of miles driven while workers not engaged on a specific offer.,178,,
1221,0.97,10017.807,10023.713,The legislation would establish a minimum payment per offer of at least five dollars.,178,,
1222,0.97,10023.713,10027.417,"That would be adjusted annually at the time, at the rate of inflation.",178,,
1223,0.97,10027.417,10035.859,The legislation would also allow the director to exclude certain offers from the minimum per offer amount.,178,,
1224,0.97,10035.859,10046.236,So that might include establishing a grace time during which a customer can cancel and offer without the minimum payment.,178,,
1225,0.97,10046.236,10047.27,The legislation specifies the grace.,178,,
1226,0.97,10047.27,10050.173,Set by the director could not be more than five minutes after acceptance.,178,,
1227,0.97,10050.173,10058.715,And that is something that is new that is not included's in the legislation that was discussed previously by the committee.,178,,
1228,0.97,10058.715,10070.794,The legislation went posed transparency requirements to provide workers with information to help them choose which office to accept and to verify compliance with the minimum payment standard.,178,,
1229,0.97,10070.794,10087.277,It also provides customers with information on the charges of the offer and it provides the office of labor standards with regular and routine access to company records that are needed to ensure compliance with the minimum payment standard.,178,,
1230,0.97,10087.277,10111.468,The information required is part of an offer has remained mostly unchanged from prior committee discussions however I wanted to highlight since the last committee discussion a definition of unsealed has been added to the legislation and these requirements have been changed to only include unsealed order contents to be disclosed to the worker.,178,,
1231,0.97,10111.468,10126.683,As discussed previously the legislation would require electronic receipts to both workers and customers within 24 hours of completion in addition to a weekly statement to the worker.,178,,
1232,0.97,10126.683,10130.52,As well is a 14 day notice before changes to the way that payment is calculated.,178,,
1233,0.97,10130.52,10135.191,That is a notice to the worker I should clarify.,178,,
1234,0.97,10135.191,10150.707,I also just wanted to note this slide says significant changes however the legislation currently specifies that this requirement applies to material changes.,178,,
1235,0.97,10150.707,10152.509,That was something that was agreed to by the Stakeholders.,178,,
1236,0.97,10152.509,10155.245,I just wanted to highlight that has been changed in the legislation.,178,,
1237,0.97,10155.245,10158.882,The final component of the legislation is flexibility requirements.,178,,
1238,0.97,10158.882,10170.86,The legislation would require that workers be allowed to be locked into the platform when they choose without limitation except for health and safety restrictions.,178,,
1239,0.97,10170.86,10178.067,As well as giving workers the right to decide work availability and the right to accept or reject any offer.,178,,
1240,0.97,10178.067,10183.339,That would include any type of offers or any number or proportion of offers.,178,,
1241,0.97,10183.339,10187.21,From the network company.,178,,
1242,0.97,10187.21,10199.656,In addition the legislation would allow the at based workers to cancel offers with cause under the circumstances listed.,178,,
1243,0.97,10199.656,10207.597,That would include the offer and information is inaccurate and the offer cannot be completed due to the customer actions.,178,,
1244,0.97,10207.597,10214.037,That would be if the customer is not there unless it is a contact list delivery.,178,,
1245,0.97,10214.037,10224.948,And also that the completion of the offers unsafe or impractical or if there is a good faith complaint about sexual Harassment or dissemination.,178,,
1246,0.97,10224.948,10230.253,On behalf of the worker.,178,,
1247,0.97,10230.253,10239.262,"Finally, this is less light about the actual legislation overview.",178,,
1248,0.97,10239.262,10248.938,The effective date of the legislation would be 30 days after signing however the provisions of the new chapter would not go into effect until 12 months after the legislation's effective date.,178,,
1249,0.97,10248.938,10259.916,This is to give the office of labor standard more time for outreach and engagement and Rulemaking.,178,,
1250,0.97,10259.916,10274.297,Before I move on I wanted to stop and see if there are any questions from the Council members about the overview of the legislation.,178,,
1251,0.97,10274.297,10275.365,Okay.,178,,
1252,0.97,10275.365,10284.474,See you know and I will move on the policy considerations that the committee may want to think about during deliberation and the amendment process for Countable 12094.,178,,
1253,0.97,10284.474,10291.414,First I wanted to highlight potential impacts to workers customers and businesses.,178,,
1254,0.97,10291.414,10299.989,As has been discussed in the committee previously this legislation is intended to address paying for outpaced workers.,178,,
1255,0.97,10299.989,10310.9,But like most labor standards and business regulations will likely have impacts particular businesses that use companies for deliveries and for customers who utilize the services.,178,,
1256,0.97,10310.9,10321.678,The pay standard would likely increase the cost of operations for network companies and those companies could pass that increase on to customers who are part of businesses.,178,,
1257,0.97,10321.678,10324.714,These increases are unsustainable companies could choose not to do business in Seattle.,178,,
1258,0.97,10324.714,10330.82,Which would obviously have detrimental impacts on businesses and other workers.,178,,
1259,0.97,10330.82,10336.292,However it is very hard to predict or quantify what these impacts may be.,178,,
1260,0.97,10336.292,10350.907,I did search for any studies detailing impacts for similar regulations but as you know this type of regulation is very new and therefore there is not significant data or analysis on pay standards specifically for at based companies.,178,,
1261,0.97,10350.907,10361.284,I also look for analysis of the impacts from pay standards and regulations for transportation network companies.,178,,
1262,0.97,10361.284,10366.589,Which has some Similarities to this bill obviously.,178,,
1263,0.97,10366.589,10372.862,In Seattle the fair share legislation establish minimum payment standards for Dnc drivers that went into effect on January 1ST of last year.,178,,
1264,0.97,10372.862,10382.739,"There were reports, middle of last year from PNC companies that the regulations resulted in a 50% increase in cost per ride.",178,,
1265,0.97,10382.739,10388.478,However I have not seen the data independently verified.,178,,
1266,0.97,10388.478,10399.655,In addition the D & amp; C companies report demand for rides is recovering more slowly in Seattle and other markets which they attribute to the higher cost of rights.,178,,
1267,0.97,10399.655,10412.535,Because of this the committee met what to consider enacting legislation as proposed in funding the study to monitor the impacts of the regulations with the intention of modifying the regulations based on the study findings.,178,,
1268,0.97,10412.535,10430.319,The committee could also delay acting legislation in order to fund a study to examine and model the potential impacts to businesses and workers and customers to inform development of the policy.,178,,
1269,0.97,10430.319,10439.695,The next thing I want to highlight is the legislation's coverage of businesses and workers.,178,,
1270,0.97,10439.695,10442.732,The legislation currently includes broad definitions for company worker coverage.,178,,
1271,0.97,10442.732,10444.2,To be clarified in detail during Rulemaking.,178,,
1272,0.97,10444.2,10457.98,The benefit of this is that it provides more time to get into the detail of different operational models and develop rules which reflect the nuances of various companies and how they operate.,178,,
1273,0.97,10457.98,10469.292,In addition this is rapidly evolving and creating this detail and Rulemaking rather than the legislation can create more flexibility to make revisions moving forward.,178,,
1274,0.97,10469.292,10482.538,However some Stakeholders have communicated to counsel that they would prefer that additional detail about coverage be determined by counsel and codified in the legislation.,178,,
1275,0.97,10482.538,10492.481,The committee may want to consider providing additional clarity and specifics related to coverage.,178,,
1276,0.97,10492.481,10498.654,For example offers before by workers covered by an employee relationship while they are performing the offer are excluded.,178,,
1277,0.97,10498.654,10516.672,The committee could consider amending the legislation to change the definition of covered network companies to provide more detail on concepts like facilitate or present or Intermediation which are all terms that are used in the definition of covered companies.,178,,
1278,0.97,10516.672,10533.923,The committee may want to amend the legislation to provide other clarifying language related to--or they could amend the legislation to require additional clarification through Rulemaking.,178,,
1279,0.97,10533.923,10538.628,The next issue I wanted to bring to the committee's attention is about marketplace network companies.,178,,
1280,0.97,10538.628,10546.569,As we discussed these companies using model which does not track time mileage or geography of work.,178,,
1281,0.97,10546.569,10552.408,This makes applying the payment standard very difficult.,178,,
1282,0.97,10552.408,10554.944,The legislation establishes different regulations for marketplace companies.,178,,
1283,0.97,10554.944,10566.489,For example that engaged time is based on estimates prior to acceptance of the offer and miles driven during an offer are not considered when calculating the minimum payment.,178,,
1284,0.97,10566.489,10575.164,This may result in less effective worker protections but also may not fully reflect the operational model of all marketplace network companies.,178,,
1285,0.97,10575.164,10584.24,The committee may want to consider amending the legislation to add regulations for marketplace network companies to strengthen and clarify the requirements.,178,,
1286,0.97,10584.24,10592.448,The committee may consider amending the legislation to require additional clarification through Rulemaking.,178,,
1287,0.97,10592.448,10600.69,Or the committee may want to consider amending the legislation to accept all or some marketplace companies or offers from the minimum network payment.,178,,
1288,0.97,10600.69,10613.169,I do think I just want to highlight there are some really important protections related to flexibility and transparency such as the ability to cancel with cause.,178,,
1289,0.97,10613.169,10624.146,That of market place companies are excluded completely that it is hard to do the payment calculations to that would exclude them from those of the protections as well.,178,,
1290,0.97,10624.146,10636.726,So we might want to talk about the pros and cons of the level of exemption of those companies if that is something that the committee wants to pursue.,178,,
1291,0.97,10636.726,10641.163,Fourth I wanted to talk a little bit about the adjustments to associated factors.,178,,
1292,0.97,10641.163,10657.847,"As discussed previously the associated cost factor, associated time factor, and my old factor are all intended to reflect the expenses incurred when a worker is performing this work.",178,,
1293,0.97,10657.847,10667.423,The legislation States the associated cost factor and associated time factors may be adjusted by the Ols director but they may never go below the initial rate set in this legislation.,178,,
1294,0.97,10667.423,10676.132,It is possible that the covered cost could change significantly.,178,,
1295,0.97,10676.132,10690.346,"For example if the state takes action to include at based workers the state unemployment insurance or paid family medical leave programs, the cost of covering those expenses could be decreased significantly from workers.",178,,
1296,0.97,10690.346,10700.756,The Council may want to consider amending the legislation to allow associated factors to be decreased by the Ols director if the needed components change Úsignificantly.,178,,
1297,0.97,10700.756,10704.36,Where change or decrease significantly.,178,,
1298,0.97,10704.36,10725.514,In addition the legislation does not specifically authorize the Ols director to adjust the associated mild factor in the committee may want to amend the legislation to provide that authorization as well as guidance for any adjustment that the director might choose to implement.,178,,
1299,0.97,10725.514,10737.86,The next to last issue is the legislation would authorize the office of labor standard director to issue revise or rescind rules to minister and enforce the minimum payment standards.,178,,
1300,0.97,10737.86,10744.834,In some cases for making is required in some cases Rulemaking is discretionary.,178,,
1301,0.97,10744.834,10755.745,"If you're interested in this specifics we can either discuss them later, they are also included in more detail in the memo.",178,,
1302,0.97,10755.745,10771.06,Similar to company and worker coverage discussed previously using Rulemaking can provide flexibility however some Stakeholders have requested the legislation go into more detail on policies rather than rely on Rulemaking.,178,,
1303,0.97,10771.06,10778.868,The committee may want to consider amending the legislation to include specific policies rather than delegating to Rulemaking.,178,,
1304,0.97,10778.868,10788.978,They might consider amending the legislation to include more specific guidelines for policies delegated to Rulemaking.,178,,
1305,0.97,10788.978,10798.42,Or they could consider amending the legislation to change whether specific Rulemaking is required or discretionary.,178,,
1306,0.97,10798.42,10800.222,I believe this is less light.,178,,
1307,0.97,10800.222,10804.76,Related policy considerations.,178,,
1308,0.97,10804.76,10815.471,"Ols has provided the Council with an estimate of the cost to implement, administer and establish by this bill.",178,,
1309,0.97,10815.471,10824.68,"The cost would be 1.2 million in 2023 including 670,000 for staffing costs and 567,000 for Non-Staffing costs.",178,,
1310,0.97,10824.68,10831.921,In addition Ols estimates it will cost about 1.2 million in ongoing costs beginning in 2024.,178,,
1311,0.97,10831.921,10838.827,I just want to note this is more what I included in the memo in the presentation.,178,,
1312,0.97,10838.827,10846.869,"Because the Ols estimate includes full staffing in year one prior to the legislation, legislative requirements going into effect.",178,,
1313,0.97,10846.869,10867.256,I will continue to work with Ols and CBO to determine how much staffing will be needed in year one to stand with the program versus the ongoing staff made by Ols regardless of what that your one number ends up being these costs cannot be absorbed by the Department.,178,,
1314,0.97,10867.256,10892.881,The committee may want to consider increasing funding for Ols to perform these responsibilities either in 2022 or in the 2023 and will budget that would need to be done through separate legislation or the committee could not allocate additional funding which would allow Ols to Prioritize the work within their existing resources as determined by the Department.,178,,
1315,0.97,10892.881,10904.627,I wanted to stop your and see if there were any questions related to the policy considerations that I've outlined?,178,,
1316,0.97,10904.627,10907.63,I am looking to see whether or not there were any raised hands.,179,,
1317,0.97,10907.63,10910.132,I want to really think you.,179,,
1318,0.97,10910.132,10911.533,The Mack I have.,179,,
1319,0.97,10911.533,10917.439,"Arena bowl who was also--Councilman Nelson, I'm speaking.",180,,
1320,0.97,10917.439,10917.84,Oh sorry.,181,,
1321,0.97,10917.84,10918.674,Thank you.,182,,
1322,0.97,10918.674,10929.285,"I want to think in Gore for all of the work you have been doing, Jasmine as well, Cleanable.",183,,
1323,0.97,10929.285,10967.589,"I want to comment on one thing that I heard in public comments about the quality of the work and it was very complementary, and I just want to say that the level of detail and competitiveness of this very complex policy has just been incredible and you have really Delved into those details and the complexity and given us options to consider and you continue to do so.",183,,
1324,0.97,10967.589,10988.944,For the viewing public if there are issues that may not be fully addressed in the ordinance that is not because the ordinance is poorly drafted it is because we are recognizing there are some decisions that need to be made's the Rulemaking process.,183,,
1325,0.97,10988.944,11010.099,"We can continue to have a conversation about whether or not the bill as introduced, does the job of the Council and the committee want as it relates to making the decisions about which things should be decided in Rulemaking process in which things should be in the ordinance itself.",183,,
1326,0.97,11010.099,11015.938,But that is part of the delivery process and this is by no means a final product.,183,,
1327,0.97,11015.938,11018.574,I will touch on next steps in closing remarks.,183,,
1328,0.97,11018.574,11027.983,But now opening it up to Councilmembers . Council member--I see you have your hand raised.,183,,
1329,0.97,11027.983,11029.151,And if had your hand raised.,183,,
1330,0.97,11029.151,11030.986,I will recommend you first.,183,,
1331,0.97,11030.986,11031.286,Thank you.,183,,
1332,0.97,11031.286,11032.755,Thank you so much Councilmember.,184,,
1333,0.97,11032.755,11037.76,"Excuse me, Madam chair and also I want to thank you for the work you put in to the--process.",184,,
1334,0.97,11037.76,11047.236,I know many folks who called and were part of the process--you for that but I wanted to take a minute to thank you and--as well.,184,,
1335,0.97,11047.236,11048.037,Council member Louis.,184,,
1336,0.97,11048.037,11069.224,I want to note the irony in having the legislation in the state Legislature reference when the legislation I actually had the opportunity to sponsor in 2019 through a robust process and many similarly situated companies at the time criticize that process which then led to the interest of being taken up at the state level.,184,,
1337,0.97,11069.224,11082.171,So there will always be critics but I do think the robust process that you put into place and actually the time you took to hit pause to really do it another deep dive into the policy is something that is worth highlighting and being couple material.,184,,
1338,0.97,11082.171,11099.822,I do also want to notes on the last slide related to the fiscal NOTE and it is my intention to try and make sure in every presentation on legislation there will be a fiscal impact that we do have an opportunity to look at the fiscal note.,184,,
1339,0.97,11099.822,11106.728,Council member Peterson and his committee I did have a chance to ask questions about the tree ordinance last time.,184,,
1340,0.97,11106.728,11126.648,Not to be questioning of the policy but really to make sure that we are spending more time focused on the--perhaps in another committee meeting we can do a little bit more of a deep dive into the fiscal NOTE but I just wanted to note I think there is an option C as well as related to the cost of implementation and ongoing staffing for this potential ordinance.,184,,
1341,0.97,11126.648,11136.492,I think option C would be self generating support revenue source of some kind that could help go back into the Department.,184,,
1342,0.97,11136.492,11140.062,I don't have an idea of what that could be yet but I don't want to roll it out.,184,,
1343,0.97,11140.062,11152.641,So Councilmember--I just wanted to note I think there is a possible opportunity for us to continue to look at the Sustainability of both the--on long-term that would be options a and B. and very much.,184,,
1344,0.97,11152.641,11155.043,Those are my comments.,184,,
1345,0.97,11155.043,11160.148,Thank you.,185,,
1346,0.97,11160.148,11162.985,-- and budget chair always keeping an eye on the fiscal impacts.,185,,
1347,0.97,11162.985,11163.285,In Queue.,185,,
1348,0.97,11163.285,11166.688,Council member Nelson.,185,,
1349,0.97,11166.688,11169.558,Thank you very much Madam chair.,186,,
1350,0.97,11169.558,11175.33,"We heard public comment and I don't think anybody, let me start again.",186,,
1351,0.97,11175.33,11181.103,I absolutely support delivery drivers making a living wage.,186,,
1352,0.97,11181.103,11192.781,"And all of our public comment people companies, I am referring to the companies, the network companies you did say they also support minimum wage standards.",186,,
1353,0.97,11192.781,11205.627,"My problem has always been the inevitable--consequences on the drivers, small businesses that are supported by these and the customers.",186,,
1354,0.97,11205.627,11212.401,When you impose a single regulatory framework on such a wide diversity of business models.,186,,
1355,0.97,11212.401,11220.676,We got letters this past week and you flagged the notion of having a study.,186,,
1356,0.97,11220.676,11230.319,I will say I do support having a study to look at these two consider these particular impacts and I can go into what that study would include.,186,,
1357,0.97,11230.319,11235.123,But I am not the only one saying this.,186,,
1358,0.97,11235.123,11252.04,The Seattle metropolitan Latino Chamber says we are deeply concerned about the unintended consequences Seattle pay may have on our community specifically because there has been no third-party or independent researcher studies about this regulation yet.,186,,
1359,0.97,11252.04,11268.824,"Bishop Gary Tyson of the general Baptist convention of the Pacific Northwest says, he makes the note that his community benefits from Web- based work and says, we believe this legislation must be set aside to do the work to better understand its impact on the communities that we work to connect and empower.",186,,
1360,0.97,11268.824,11279.768,He noted a study that had been done but these comments to call for an independent research.,186,,
1361,0.97,11279.768,11283.538,"So it all comes down to, which consultant are you going to use?",186,,
1362,0.97,11283.538,11291.413,"The minimum we can go into, the inconsistencies of the two studies that were done to inform the fair share.",186,,
1363,0.97,11291.413,11298.086,But my point is that there does need to be a lot more input and analysis.,186,,
1364,0.97,11298.086,11306.862,Often it is the link that the Stakeholder processes brought up.,186,,
1365,0.97,11306.862,11313.535,The applicants of the proposal have been running the Stakeholder outreach and meetings.,186,,
1366,0.97,11313.535,11315.604,So there is a bit of a conflict of interest there.,186,,
1367,0.97,11315.604,11323.078,But just in the past two weeks a whole new category of companies has been in back did.,186,,
1368,0.97,11323.078,11323.578,Marketplace companies.,186,,
1369,0.97,11323.578,11329.484,"And that is because some very Nuanced concerns from service providers, at a service providers.",186,,
1370,0.97,11329.484,11335.023,The companies that don't just deliver things that provide services to people in need.,186,,
1371,0.97,11335.023,11341.763,Their concerns were finally being heard.,186,,
1372,0.97,11341.763,11351.64,Regulations were refined to address those concerns and a whole new set of rules wage relations apply to those people.,186,,
1373,0.97,11351.64,11366.321,My point is that is basically Walkable because as soon as you solve for one problem and other problems pop up and some of these companies like Angie and Karin.Com just found out about this legislation by accident.,186,,
1374,0.97,11366.321,11380.936,This outreach and this study and leaving it to the final vote has to be more robust so companies that don't even know they are impacted can voice their concerns.,186,,
1375,0.97,11380.936,11382.571,We just got a letter from drivers as well.,186,,
1376,0.97,11382.571,11392.714,"I am making the point that, yes there has been a long Stakeholder process but it has been incomplete.",186,,
1377,0.97,11392.714,11400.622,That is why I believe we do need to have a lot more input.,186,,
1378,0.97,11400.622,11403.091,I will touch on the Rulemaking process.,186,,
1379,0.97,11403.091,11417.205,"It is deeply concerning to me that so much of the details, so much of the implementation of this legislation will be decided after we vote out of committee.",186,,
1380,0.97,11417.205,11420.475,What expertise does the Ols director have to make a lot of these decisions?,186,,
1381,0.97,11420.475,11429.885,"How will they come, I will be come to the decisions about engaged time?",186,,
1382,0.97,11429.885,11431.52,"What is Compensable time for overnight services, etc .?",186,,
1383,0.97,11431.52,11433.955,The list goes on.,186,,
1384,0.97,11433.955,11456.077,"So one option that is not presented in policy considerations is to, my third one, eliminate Market-Based companies altogether from this legislation because it was clearly designed to impact, raise the wages by delivery not necessarily income of delivery drivers.",186,,
1385,0.97,11456.077,11470.091,"But another suggestion I would have is to pass legislation but allow, delay its implementation until Ols can complete its rule making process.",186,,
1386,0.97,11470.091,11474.83,"And that Rulemaking, those rules would be approved by counsel.",186,,
1387,0.97,11474.83,11487.509,"So that is one way to make sure we don't, we don't Multiply the unintended consequences in this legislation.",186,,
1388,0.97,11487.509,11493.481,"Before I headed over to the cosponsor of the bill, I just wanted to quickly respond to a couple things.",187,,
1389,0.97,11493.481,11500.222,-- referred to it as a single revelatory framework.,187,,
1390,0.97,11500.222,11502.023,It is not a single regulatory framework as mentioned earlier.,187,,
1391,0.97,11502.023,11511.733,There is a different definition for marketplace Apps and a different regulatory center that they have to meet.,187,,
1392,0.97,11511.733,11517.038,That is significantly different for the On-Demand Apps.,187,,
1393,0.97,11517.038,11534.923,The Stakeholder engagement weekly at one point Stakeholder engagement meetings were not run by working Washington they were run by my staff with sometimes my self attending and Council member Louis attending.,187,,
1394,0.97,11534.923,11537.125,With the assistance of counsel central staff.,187,,
1395,0.97,11537.125,11538.627,And Ols participating.,187,,
1396,0.97,11538.627,11556.978,"I want to also reference, I appreciate what the options in Amy's memo related to a study and does include the ability to study impacts.",187,,
1397,0.97,11556.978,11560.115,Just step back about what the goal of this effort is.,187,,
1398,0.97,11560.115,11565.654,It's about making sure that people are getting at least the minimum wage for their work in the city.,187,,
1399,0.97,11565.654,11582.637,So I would be interested in learning about the impacts of that very basics hundred and seeing if there are things to do to mitigate those impacts but not as a prerequisite to the legislation.,187,,
1400,0.97,11582.637,11590.745,This is a minimum work standard that we are looking to extend to these workers.,187,,
1401,0.97,11590.745,11598.687,A local study at the Universiy Washington showed that the increase of--are $15 minimum wage.,187,,
1402,0.97,11598.687,11607.629,Does not lead to higher products or cost for products for consumers.,187,,
1403,0.97,11607.629,11619.674,And the decision of whether or not to increase prices on products and services is within the companies jurisdiction.,187,,
1404,0.97,11619.674,11629.517,We know there were many inputs and outputs of these financial decisions and one is the prophet.,187,,
1405,0.97,11629.517,11635.056,"And so you don't automatically, the thing you don't have to increase prices.",187,,
1406,0.97,11635.056,11666.187,"I would argue if you want to make sure people are still buying your product, it's not really the best business practice to increase the prices if it's going to impact the interest of people buying your product and there are other ways to look at addressing the cost for this very basic minimum standard to impact workers.",187,,
1407,0.97,11666.187,11683.371,I really appreciate also Councilman Nelson you are sort of digging into the difference between the market place and the On-Demand Apps.,187,,
1408,0.97,11683.371,11689.244,I look forward to having more conversations.,187,,
1409,0.97,11689.244,11718.506,"Our thinking on including the marketplace Apps and the legislation is really in recognition that this particular sector of, our workforce has evolved Exponentially almost as, in sort of an inverse relationship to the increase in worker protections.",187,,
1410,0.97,11718.506,11730.118,"So as we have passed more laws to protect workers the numbers of people who work, who don't get those rights has increased.",187,,
1411,0.97,11730.118,11751.906,"We don't want to create the same sort of dynamic with this legislation that by not regulating the marketplace Apps that we create a big loophole that then the model, the, the employment model shifts to sort of take advantage of that loophole.",187,,
1412,0.97,11751.906,11762.016,We want to make sure that everybody is paid fairly for an hours work including covering the cost associated with doing that work.,187,,
1413,0.97,11762.016,11765.453,Councilmember Lewis.,187,,
1414,0.97,11765.453,11768.69,Thank you Councilmember--since it is almost 1 P.M.,188,,
1415,0.97,11768.69,11777.966,I just want to make some comments about how I do think the process up to this point has been robust and very inclusive.,188,,
1416,0.97,11777.966,11788.009,I want to very much think yourself and Alex--on your team for his steadfast work and really organizing and working through a lot of issues with Stakeholders.,188,,
1417,0.97,11788.009,11803.424,I think it is important for this to now go in to be the work of the committee to start sorting through some of the issues that Councilman Nelson has flagged and Council member Nelson I do appreciate you flooding those issues.,188,,
1418,0.97,11803.424,11814.269,I think what it represents is that some issues really can only be resolved through the public discourse and not necessarily through Stakeholder process.,188,,
1419,0.97,11814.269,11821.109,The Stakeholder process has kind of gotten us to a starting point here for the legislative process.,188,,
1420,0.97,11821.109,11835.089,"And I acknowledge that it is difficult for some of these platforms to, to engage in the Stakeholder process to a certain extent.",188,,
1421,0.97,11835.089,11842.831,"And at the same time, you know, reserve the right to oppose the legislation.",188,,
1422,0.97,11842.831,11851.072,"And I understand and respect, you know, politics is politics and a lot of these platforms would sooner or not be subject to any kind of regulation and I understand that and respect that.",188,,
1423,0.97,11851.072,11865.386,But I wouldn't Misconstrue that to mean they were not involved in the Stakeholder process and did not contribute in meaningful ways to providing certain feedback that has materially impacted this initial proposal.,188,,
1424,0.97,11865.386,11880.235,"As you state this draft includes a fairly detailed, start and kind of talking about these marketplace Apps versus delivery Apps for example.",188,,
1425,0.97,11880.235,11892.013,And that is a direct result of engagement with the marketplace Apps talking about how the model is distinct and what a different issues in the kind of activity they engage in are.,188,,
1426,0.97,11892.013,11907.629,I will own up that I still have ongoing questions and concerns about the extent to which this legislation interfaces with the marketplace Apps but that is all part of our legislating discussion at--process.,188,,
1427,0.97,11907.629,11919.44,"So I just wanted to say I think that definitely this committee should Delve into these issues, flag things for an amendment and then the outreach and Stakeholder in should continue.",188,,
1428,0.97,11919.44,11936.991,But I do think that a good process was put together by central staff and Councilmember--and myself to get us to the starting point where we can go through some of the issues that are still on the table.,188,,
1429,0.97,11936.991,11938.326,Thank you.,189,,
1430,0.97,11938.326,11941.596,Council member Nelson.,189,,
1431,0.97,11941.596,11949.904,"So to answer your question, I am not saying that the minimum payment standard is the wrong way to go.",190,,
1432,0.97,11949.904,11956.377,The unintended consequence which has been documented is a drop in demand.,190,,
1433,0.97,11956.377,11969.791,And what happens to the income of drivers when demands--not passed on to consumers.,190,,
1434,0.97,11969.791,11973.394,So that is what I was talking about when I said unintended consequence.,190,,
1435,0.97,11973.394,11978.8,We also have to think about the customer.,190,,
1436,0.97,11978.8,11981.769,Because there is a convenience factor here.,190,,
1437,0.97,11981.769,11988.977,"We cannot, we cannot predict the continued as you said evolution of these kinds of companies.",190,,
1438,0.97,11988.977,11994.182,But it is being driven by demand for access and convenience.,190,,
1439,0.97,11994.182,12006.761,Nowhere in this legislation is a contemplated that what is happening is the consumers want a flat fee.,190,,
1440,0.97,12006.761,12015.103,You're Dishwasher is broken: somebody will fix it for $200.,190,,
1441,0.97,12015.103,12016.237,So the whole calculation is meaningless.,190,,
1442,0.97,12016.237,12027.482,Based on the calculation of the books right now I did the math and it is about $34.35 for 320 minute Five-Mile drives.,190,,
1443,0.97,12027.482,12027.749,Caution.,190,,
1444,0.97,12027.749,12039.427,"Because these are very complex and if we are concerned about the delivery drivers, why not just take that body of work and proceed?",190,,
1445,0.97,12039.427,12046.768,"As I said, the marketplace company definition was just included in the past two weeks.",190,,
1446,0.97,12046.768,12054.575,So there is clearly a lot of work that has to be done before we get to perhaps more issue identification at the next meeting.,190,,
1447,0.97,12054.575,12058.98,When we will have other important things on the agenda.,190,,
1448,0.97,12058.98,12059.981,Thank you so much.,191,,
1449,0.97,12059.981,12064.051,I really appreciate those thoughts.,191,,
1450,0.97,12064.051,12067.688,One other point I want to make.,191,,
1451,0.97,12067.688,12098.052,"You mentioned the implementation for the effective date that it should not be effective until the Rulemaking process is complete, there is sort of an effective date of the ordinance which allows Ols to go forth and begin the Rulemaking process and then there is the ability to enforce the law which will not happen until after the Rulemaking process is complete .?",191,,
1452,0.97,12098.052,12103.124,I am saying Council should approve the rules before it goes into effect.,191,,
1453,0.97,12103.124,12109.163,"Because, here we are just putting the cart before the horse.",191,,
1454,0.97,12109.163,12109.964,That is one approach.,192,,
1455,0.97,12109.964,12133.921,I think it would be great if Maybe we pull together information about Ols lawmaking process and pass bills that the Council has adopted and the types of rules that they historically have been delegated to Ols in the process for doing so.,192,,
1456,0.97,12133.921,12142.063,They do have sort of the expertise to get in the weeds and also engaged with Stakeholders as part of that rule making process.,192,,
1457,0.97,12142.063,12174.562,"If they do sort of a deep level of engagement before those rules are--just on that, hearing your thoughts, again Council member Nelson, and I think being able to demonstrate Ols history with Rulemaking might be helpful information for this discussion as well.",192,,
1458,0.97,12174.562,12185.306,With that I just want to flag we will have time set aside for this bill in upcoming meetings.,192,,
1459,0.97,12185.306,12189.577,The 26th and on May 10th.,192,,
1460,0.97,12189.577,12196.284,I wanted us here from Amy.,192,,
1461,0.97,12196.284,12210.298,Even though my notes say that we are going to be putting on a--next meeting I don't think that is accurate.,192,,
1462,0.97,12210.298,12210.898,My understanding.,193,,
1463,0.97,12210.898,12212.333,It is honestly up to the chair.,193,,
1464,0.97,12212.333,12224.712,My understanding was that the April 26 meeting would be a discussion of amendments but there would not be able on that but that is up to the chair.,193,,
1465,0.97,12224.712,12243.864,"I'm thinking the next meeting might be the time to discuss amendments conceptually rather than expecting committee members to get you language for, that you amendments that you then have the craft language for at the next meeting.",194,,
1466,0.97,12243.864,12254.575,I think that is a little short of a time frame for folks to turn that around.,194,,
1467,0.97,12254.575,12287.908,Maybe when you think of our next committee meeting is more of sort of a deep dive into the issue 80 that you started very helpfully with in this meeting and maybe if Council members can begin to think about what alternatives they like to have discussed in the next meeting as sort of an issue idea I think that would be a good next step.,194,,
1468,0.97,12287.908,12288.209,Great.,194,,
1469,0.97,12288.209,12295.416,"Thank you, everybody for making time for this meeting.",194,,
1470,0.97,12295.416,12306.594,"The next public safety and service Committee is scheduled for Tuesday, April 26th at 930 A.M.",194,,
1471,0.97,12306.594,12311.899,I just want to note the time is 12:58.,194,,
1472,0.97,12311.899,12315.97,There were no further comments from my colleagues?,194,,
1473,0.97,12315.97,12320.408,Hearing and seeing none.,194,,
1474,0.97,12320.408,12321.208,Thank you so much.,194,,
1475,0.97,12321.208,12322.443,We are adjourned.,194,,
