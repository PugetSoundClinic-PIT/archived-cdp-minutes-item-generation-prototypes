266,0.97,1453.185,1465.43,Commission has conducted two reviews of the proposal proposal.,56,,
267,0.97,1465.43,1470.035,We appreciate and understand the concerns of Digital Messaging.,57,,
268,0.97,1470.035,1480.712,In 2019 we were concerned about this issue relative to the Digital Signage near the Ew arena.,57,,
269,0.97,1480.712,1494.593,We believe the current plan balances the need to provide an updated approach that modernizes Signage to message events to the public with a focus restraint on distribution throughout the campus.,57,,
270,0.97,1494.593,1506.438,We're encouraged by the rule Digital Signage can provide to increase the presence of nonprofit special events and benefiting from the center.,57,,
271,0.97,1506.438,1521.152,We do believe the proposed amendments will result in a plan that helps reduce the negative impacts of some of the outdated and flexible Signage that really had a lot of issues and limited flexibility of cure rating events.,57,,
272,0.97,1521.152,1530.295,We do have lingering concerns about the need to balance the realities and spontaneous recognition with the provision of recognition that serves the public.,57,,
273,0.97,1530.295,1537.335,We look to the Seattle center to apply that.,57,,
274,0.97,1537.335,1543.041,"To give an overview of recommendations, I think I have a couple seconds here.",57,,
275,0.97,1543.041,1555.487,We do hope that public art can be integrated into the Signage plan as well as integration with the free standing campus.,57,,

720,0.97,3725.621,3731.861,"I want to ask a couple questions, some of which were answered in the presentation.",166,,
721,0.97,3731.861,3747.877,"I did want to ask, what's the break down in terms of residential versus commercial pairs in terms of contribution or terms of total raw number or assessment out of curiosity?",166,,
722,0.97,3747.877,3751.38,That's a number I do not have in my head.,167,,
723,0.97,3751.38,3755.818,"Of all things filling my head, I don't have that handy.",167,,
724,0.97,3755.818,3762.892,Perhaps the FAS may have that number handy.,167,,
725,0.97,3762.892,3763.96,I can speak to that.,168,,
726,0.97,3763.96,3767.497,There's over 6 million in the lid.,168,,
727,0.97,3767.497,3770.266,The bulk are residential condos.,168,,
728,0.97,3770.266,3778.508,80% of the total assessment dollars come from commercial properties.,168,,
729,0.97,3778.508,3786.315,So the residential component represents 20% of the revenue despite most of the rate payers?,169,,
730,0.97,3786.315,3786.549,Yes.,170,,
731,0.97,3786.549,3793.99,That would be 20% of $174 million figure?,171,,
732,0.97,3793.99,3794.223,Yes.,172,,
733,0.97,3794.223,3795.458,Okay.,173,,
734,0.97,3795.458,3799.328,I think this would be one for Eric.,174,,
735,0.97,3799.328,3821.15,"In terms of the projects that are incorporated in the local improvement district, how many of these projects are completely new infrastructure improvements versus Refurbishments existing assets.",174,,
736,0.97,3821.15,3827.089,This might be a good time to refer to the slide list of projects as a way.,174,,
737,0.97,3827.089,3828.658,Could we take a moment?,174,,
738,0.97,3828.658,3830.56,That's a good one.,175,,
739,0.97,3830.56,3837.266,"We asked him to put that in there, the six projects.",175,,
740,0.97,3837.266,3838.801,Yeah.,176,,
741,0.97,3838.801,3841.003,Is that slide two or three?,177,,
742,0.97,3841.003,3841.337,There we go.,177,,
743,0.97,3841.337,3848.844,"The so Council member, I'll move through the list and describe them.",177,,
744,0.97,3848.844,3853.182,Hope Fridayfully this will answer your questions.,177,,
745,0.97,3853.182,3859.989,This will be the Walkway along the new way along the water front.,177,,
746,0.97,3859.989,3869.565,"Absent these improvements, there would be a new roadway there.",177,,
747,0.97,3869.565,3871.2,The Prominade makes it more road like.,177,,
748,0.97,3871.2,3874.604,There's been a roadway as you know.,177,,
749,0.97,3874.604,3875.871,There's been a roadway there.,177,,
750,0.97,3875.871,3878.641,The promenade is improvement of what would otherwise be there.,177,,
751,0.97,3878.641,3885.414,The walk would be a new connection that comes down from the market down to the new water front park.,177,,
752,0.97,3885.414,3891.52,"As you know, there's ways to get down through stairways and that sort of thing.",177,,
753,0.97,3891.52,3898.761,This would be a Bridge-Like shelter with views of the water and public gathering spaces.,177,,
754,0.97,3898.761,3903.099,It will arch over and incorporate expansion of the Aquarium.,177,,
755,0.97,3903.099,3904.1,There's definitely new features to that.,177,,
756,0.97,3904.1,3914.777,"In terms of the movement of people, there's been a way to walk down and make your way from market down to the water front.",177,,
757,0.97,3914.777,3917.813,Nothing as substantial as the walk would offer.,177,,
758,0.97,3917.813,3918.781,It does not compare.,177,,
759,0.97,3918.781,3934.597,"From that point of view, the walk is new to the scene.",177,,
760,0.97,3934.597,3938.968,All improve on improving infrastructure.,177,,
761,0.97,3938.968,3939.435,They're significant.,177,,
762,0.97,3939.435,3947.276,"In the park, there's been park space not quite like this.",177,,
763,0.97,3947.276,3957.853,This involves--I so much want to refer folks to imagery in pictures and scheduling of things on the Seattle water front Website.,177,,
764,0.97,3957.853,3963.526,There's a lot of visual pictures I didn't have in the scope of the slide.,177,,
765,0.97,3963.526,3967.43,The water front park doesn't introduce a park to the water front.,177,,
766,0.97,3967.43,3973.302,We have had park spaces down there.,177,,
767,0.97,3973.302,3976.706,It will be a scale that's nonexistent before.,177,,
768,0.97,3976.706,3981.143,I'll stop there for a moment.,177,,
769,0.97,3981.143,3983.112,That is really helpful.,178,,
770,0.97,3983.112,3990.086,"The scope of questions, I would ask of any lid before the Council.",178,,
771,0.97,3990.086,3995.791,I do think it's important given our oversight role.,178,,
772,0.97,3995.791,4010.74,I heard of schemes not necessarily associated with this project around using lids as a potential to revenue mechanism to make replacements to existing infrastructure capacity.,178,,
773,0.97,4010.74,4028.224,"For me, it would not be existent with the purpose of lids which is more to make the acquisition creation of new assets and new improvements rather than just the maintenance obligations of the city.",178,,
774,0.97,4028.224,4048.077,I wanted to ask questions as a way of underscoring this is a project that is aimed toward the creation of new improvements and assets that will considerably change the bill's environment and urban landscape of this particular local improvement district.,178,,
775,0.97,4048.077,4057.119,I don't have any other questions at moment relevant to this initial part here.,178,,
776,0.97,4057.119,4057.42,Thank you.,178,,
777,0.97,4057.42,4057.853,You're welcome.,179,,

782,0.97,4074.036,4078.307,"It's for all Commerce, business, cruise ships, parks.",181,,
783,0.97,4078.307,4080.276,It's a project that's been going on for a while.,181,,

817,0.97,4203.799,4209.138,I want to thank the people that put together information in our packets.,190,,
818,0.97,4209.138,4209.838,There's a ton of it.,190,,
819,0.97,4209.838,4212.308,I had the chance to go through it.,190,,
820,0.97,4212.308,4217.513,I will let you go forward with that presentation.,190,,
821,0.97,4217.513,4221.35,I'm going to share my screen again.,191,,
822,0.97,4221.35,4221.65,One second.,191,,
823,0.97,4221.65,4225.454,"That's just three pages, correct?",192,,
824,0.97,4225.454,4226.455,Yeah.,193,,
825,0.97,4226.455,4239.935,"This is regarding the bond issuance, Finance piece, squaring away the code with the Rcw, the 10 to 20 year payment and how we do if people can't pay right away.",194,,
826,0.97,4239.935,4241.036,I forget the term you use.,194,,
827,0.97,4241.036,4246.709,You're probably going to correct me and should.,194,,
828,0.97,4246.709,4247.643,The deferral payment.,194,,
829,0.97,4247.643,4248.777,The go ahead.,194,,
830,0.97,4248.777,4252.915,This is the city Finance director.,195,,
831,0.97,4252.915,4253.449,Good afternoon everyone.,195,,
832,0.97,4253.449,4255.884,I'll start with this.,195,,
833,0.97,4255.884,4257.419,It's good to be with you today.,195,,
834,0.97,4257.419,4266.895,My colleagues and I are here to describe the lid bond Ordnance before your Committee as Eric described.,195,,
835,0.97,4266.895,4279.008,The lid bond Ordnance authorizes the sale of lid bonds subject to passage of this legislation and the final assessment role we expect the lid bonds to be issued this fall.,195,,
836,0.97,4279.008,4292.621,One point I want to mention is lid bonds are different than other bonds authorized by the Council typically in the budget process and routinely issued by the city.,195,,
837,0.97,4292.621,4309.171,Bonds are not directly secured by the city's full faith in credit as is the case with other general obligation bonds but rather lid bonds are secured by the properties in the lid area.,196,,
838,0.97,4309.171,4313.842,They're there for real estate assessment Max securities.,196,,
839,0.97,4313.842,4325.187,So I'd like to then turn this over to my colleague Christie beady to share more habit this particular Ordnance.,196,,
840,0.97,4325.187,4329.058,Christie?,196,,
841,0.97,4329.058,4334.763,I think you're on mute.,196,,
842,0.97,4334.763,4335.13,Thanks when.,197,,
843,0.97,4335.13,4337.199,My name is Christie beady.,197,,
844,0.97,4337.199,4347.109,I'll take a minute and speak to key points shown on this slide here that are contained in the bond Ordnance.,197,,
845,0.97,4347.109,4353.248,"First as Glenn mentioned, the bond Ordnance authorizes the issuance of the bonds.",197,,
846,0.97,4353.248,4357.219,"Secondly, it accomplishes the maximum size of the lid bond issuance.",197,,
847,0.97,4357.219,4365.561,The amount of bonds issued will not exceed the final assessment rule amount just voted on by Council.,197,,
848,0.97,4365.561,4371.233,Less any amount of assessments paid to the city during the 30 day prepayment period.,197,,
849,0.97,4371.233,4380.542,We want to take a second and talk about that prepayment period for a minute.,197,,
850,0.97,4380.542,4386.648,Participants can pay in full or in part without tin curing interest.,197,,
851,0.97,4386.648,4388.083,Check choose to financial over time.,197,,
852,0.97,4388.083,4403.065,Any balance that remains after the 30 day prepayment period ends will be billed by the city to participants in 20 an you'll installments beginning the year after that 30 day prepayment period.,197,,
853,0.97,4403.065,4411.173,Essentially the lid bond issuance is the vehicle for providing that financing option for those that choose to prepay.,197,,
854,0.97,4411.173,4423.051,Third this legislation provides a formula for determining the interest rate paid by those choosing to assessment.,198,,
855,0.97,4423.051,4429.425,We anticipate it to be later this year.,199,,
856,0.97,4429.425,4433.829,Did legislation addresses this issue by establishing formula for determining that interest rate.,199,,
857,0.97,4433.829,4459.321,We want to note this is for a couple different reasons somewhat of an unusual lid bond insurance in part because the size of the lid bond or lid itself is quite large compared to other lids.,199,,
858,0.97,4459.321,4462.791,It's also unique for lid bonds.,199,,
859,0.97,4462.791,4464.493,We don't know exactly how this will -,199,,
860,0.97,4464.493,4467.796,I'm going to stop you really quick.,200,,
861,0.97,4467.796,4482.778,For public and for our colleagues on the 20 year to pay the first ten years is interest can you flush that out more?,200,,
862,0.97,4482.778,4492.354,"Yes, exactly.",201,,
863,0.97,4492.354,4496.291,The interest does accrue during that time.,201,,
864,0.97,4496.291,4498.861,It eventually is due on the full principle amount.,201,,
865,0.97,4498.861,4507.603,It provides a little bit of an easier Pathway into the payments for those first ten years.,201,,
866,0.97,4507.603,4508.704,The amount is lower.,201,,
867,0.97,4508.704,4510.372,It represents interest only.,201,,
868,0.97,4510.372,4523.418,"Beginning in year 11 then, the principle amount of the full assessment is divided into ten installments in the second ten years of the 20 year installment period.",201,,
869,0.97,4523.418,4529.925,"Therefore, there would be a significant increase in the assessment amount due in year 11.",201,,
870,0.97,4529.925,4538.066,That would represent one tenth of the principle amount due in the ten years rather than being spread over 20 years.,201,,
871,0.97,4538.066,4542.938,There's not a requirement to pay that as and only in the first ten years.,201,,
872,0.97,4542.938,4545.574,It will only be billed at that amount.,201,,
873,0.97,4545.574,4565.827,You're going to touch a little bit on how the bill ending in 73 also talks about handling delinquent payments and deferral payments for disadvantaged as well?,202,,
874,0.97,4565.827,4569.898,Do you want to touch on that now or until the end?,203,,
875,0.97,4569.898,4572.034,You can wait until the end.,204,,
876,0.97,4572.034,4572.634,That sounds great.,205,,
877,0.97,4572.634,4585.847,I want to mention as described in the slide the legislation provides a formula for establishing debt service Fund.,206,,
878,0.97,4585.847,4586.381,It's required for lids.,206,,
879,0.97,4586.381,4599.828,It's is a fund the city may draw on in the event annual installment payments made by participants are not sufficient to pay the debt service due by the city.,206,,
880,0.97,4599.828,4602.965,It acts as a reserve and security for investments.,206,,
881,0.97,4602.965,4605.267,We can go to the next slide.,206,,
882,0.97,4605.267,4608.136,Glenn touched on that a little bit.,207,,
883,0.97,4608.136,4609.237,Maybe you can reinforce this.,207,,
884,0.97,4609.237,4623.585,It's important for people to know why these are not general obligation bonds and why that's important in protecting the city's Treasury and budget.,207,,
885,0.97,4623.585,4623.852,Sure.,208,,
886,0.97,4623.852,4633.328,We have Michael Van Dyke on the call who's the city debt manager.,208,,
887,0.97,4633.328,4636.031,Essentially the lids are a different financing mechanism.,208,,
888,0.97,4636.031,4647.643,They're unique in that they are backed by the properties within the lid.,208,,
889,0.97,4647.643,4654.016,They are different from bonds.,208,,
890,0.97,4654.016,4656.018,Their investment is backed by those properties.,208,,
891,0.97,4656.018,4670.165,"In that way, a lien is put on properties in the case of every lid at the time that the lid is implemented following the passage and implementation of the final assessment role.",208,,
892,0.97,4670.165,4679.808,"Would the lid have the same it rating as city of Seattle, AAA?",209,,
893,0.97,4679.808,4682.511,Not necessarily.,210,,
894,0.97,4682.511,4685.847,The lid bonds stand alone as a separate issuance.,210,,
895,0.97,4685.847,4689.818,We're back and have the strongest rating among the credit agency.,210,,
896,0.97,4689.818,4692.12,That provides the context for the city.,210,,
897,0.97,4692.12,4697.959,Each bond rate as good reviewed independently and rated independently.,210,,
898,0.97,4697.959,4707.769,"So yes to emphasize that, the city contains if strongest bond rating available from rating agencies.",210,,
899,0.97,4707.769,4710.272,We can look for just a moment.,211,,
900,0.97,4710.272,4715.01,In terms of the Timeline to touch on a couple key steps that would follow.,211,,
901,0.97,4715.01,4719.014,Today we're presenting with a possible vote by the committee June 14th.,211,,
902,0.97,4719.014,4723.952,This would be in front of the full Council for a possible vote.,211,,
903,0.97,4723.952,4736.431,"Assuming passage at that point in late June, we expect that Sdot would file the final assessment rule with the city clerk.",211,,
904,0.97,4736.431,4737.999,That's a step consistent.,211,,
905,0.97,4737.999,4758.52,"At that point, we expect in early July FAS and specifically FAS Treasury would notify participants of the 30 day prepayment period through mailing payment notice to each participant and providing notice in the Daily Journal of Commerce.",211,,
906,0.97,4758.52,4761.189,That 30 day prepayment period would end in mid August.,211,,
907,0.97,4761.189,4771.166,That essentially would be the point in which the city would determine the amount of lid bonds based on prepayments that were received.,211,,
908,0.97,4771.166,4774.202,"Late October then, the city would tell lid bonds we ape.",211,,
909,0.97,4774.202,4779.04,That would allow proceeds to be available to the city in early November.,211,,
910,0.97,4779.04,4789.351,"So if the schedule changes this, would be posted on the water front or both water front and -",212,,
911,0.97,4789.351,4789.618,Yes.,213,,
912,0.97,4789.618,4792.087,We want to keep the water front Website up to date.,213,,
913,0.97,4792.087,4796.591,That will continue to be a good source for information.,213,,
914,0.97,4796.591,4806.434,The individual assessments will only be made thrown through the prepayment notices that will be sent individually by mail.,213,,
915,0.97,4806.434,4806.701,Okay.,214,,
916,0.97,4806.701,4809.337,"And with that, I will close my comments.",215,,
917,0.97,4809.337,4824.686,I will turn over to Alana to speak a bit on the deferral option that is available through SMC.,215,,
918,0.97,4824.686,4832.928,Essentially there's a couple types of deferral options.,216,,
919,0.97,4832.928,4835.497,The state really has the robust deferral program.,216,,
920,0.97,4835.497,4839.968,It's tied to the same program people can do for property taxes.,216,,
921,0.97,4839.968,4844.472,"They have a program for seniors, low income individuals.",216,,
922,0.97,4844.472,4851.279,The state program essentially people can defer their assessments for the life of the lid.,216,,
923,0.97,4851.279,4852.347,Even potentially longer than that.,216,,
924,0.97,4852.347,4853.815,It's very long term.,216,,
925,0.97,4853.815,4861.022,I need to work with the county to submit the proper paperwork.,216,,
926,0.97,4861.022,4864.96,The city program is a little different.,216,,
927,0.97,4864.96,4869.297,The state law allows the city to have a deferral program.,216,,
928,0.97,4869.297,4869.531,We do.,216,,
929,0.97,4869.531,4872.934,This is much more of an emergency deferral program.,216,,
930,0.97,4872.934,4885.08,You can really only defer up to two years or at least that's the amount of the years the lean would be on this deferral from the guarantee Fund.,216,,
931,0.97,4885.08,4895.523,So the city deferral program is just kind of like in addition to this state program that already exists.,216,,
932,0.97,4895.523,4898.727,All deferred assessments it's important to note carry interest.,217,,
933,0.97,4898.727,4901.696,You defer them and also pay interest on the amount you defer.,217,,
934,0.97,4901.696,4909.971,It would become due at the end of the term that's deferred.,217,,
935,0.97,4909.971,4912.173,Okay.,218,,
936,0.97,4912.173,4921.816,So is there anything else from Eric or Presenters before I move to ask my colleagues what questions or concerns they may have regarding item 4?,219,,
937,0.97,4921.816,4923.285,No thank you.,220,,
938,0.97,4923.285,4924.119,All set.,220,,
939,0.97,4924.119,4926.054,I don't see Council member Lewis.,221,,
940,0.97,4926.054,4936.197,I want to make sure I'm not missing.,221,,
941,0.97,4936.197,4942.37,There he is.,221,,
942,0.97,4942.37,4947.809,I'm sure my office will get constituent options in the future.,221,,
943,0.97,4947.809,4956.418,Is there any kind of support and vision for circumstances where that might pose a hardship?,221,,
944,0.97,4956.418,4971.232,I can imagine in some cases of the residential assessments that there may be folks on fixed incomes or maybe want to pursue deferral but they feel they're setting themselves up for failure.,221,,
945,0.97,4971.232,4976.671,It's going to accrue the interest and create another hardship or burden.,221,,
946,0.97,4976.671,4985.146,They might be penalized essentially for not being positioned as their neighbors that pay in a lump sum up front for example.,221,,
947,0.97,4985.146,5021.015,Is there any kind of support currently envisioned or is that something the Council could maybe pursue over next several years given this is a financing scheme we're going to be paying off several decades I'm sure folks will talk to us about it if it is an issue.,221,,
948,0.97,5021.015,5022.717,We don't have anything now.,222,,
949,0.97,5022.717,5040.668,The step we did take to alleviate concerns is step to structure the payments and structure the bond debt service around interest only the first ten years.,222,,
950,0.97,5040.668,5045.407,That was intended to bring down the payment amounts.,222,,
951,0.97,5045.407,5060.522,"At this point, there's not any action in place now to move beyond the deferral options by the city and state.",222,,
952,0.97,5060.522,5061.022,I'm sorry.,223,,
953,0.97,5061.022,5065.193,Property owners include the Nonprofits we spoke to or contacted us.,224,,
954,0.97,5065.193,5070.165,"The Nonprofits in the lid area, correct?",224,,
955,0.97,5070.165,5070.799,That's correct.,225,,
956,0.97,5070.799,5074.335,"Council member Lewis, I cut you offer.",226,,
957,0.97,5074.335,5074.602,Go ahead.,226,,
958,0.97,5074.602,5075.27,No problem Madame chair.,227,,
959,0.97,5075.27,5080.675,I should have waited to be recognized for a follow up.,227,,
960,0.97,5080.675,5080.975,No worries.,227,,
961,0.97,5080.975,5097.959,I'll probably have some additional questions off line in this area.,227,,
962,0.97,5097.959,5098.96,I appreciate that conversation.,227,,
963,0.97,5098.96,5106.267,As we noted earlier was theft of the total with assessment.,227,,
964,0.97,5106.267,5112.64,I do probably have some additional things I'll talk to folks about.,227,,
965,0.97,5112.64,5114.142,We can do that off line.,227,,
966,0.97,5114.142,5126.154,Are there any other questions or concerns we want to put to Eric from central staff or friends from Fs and friends from Dike that's joined us?,228,,
967,0.97,5126.154,5136.965,"Seeing none, I'm going to move forward on this.",229,,
968,0.97,5136.965,5141.102,I move the committee recommend to pass Council bill 73.,229,,
969,0.97,5141.102,5141.636,Is there a second?,229,,
970,0.97,5141.636,5141.97,Second.,230,,
971,0.97,5141.97,5148.176,There's been a motion moved and Seconded.,231,,
972,0.97,5148.176,5149.177,Will the clerk please call the roll?,231,,
973,0.97,5149.177,5152.647,[roll call],231,,
974,0.97,5170.231,5175.837,"That's four in favor, none opposed.",232,,
975,0.97,5175.837,5180.575,Motion Seconded.,233,,
976,0.97,5180.575,5185.647,No opposed . Okay.,233,,
977,0.97,5185.647,5189.751,So let's go to our last piece on the agenda.,233,,
978,0.97,5189.751,5191.319,That concludes items of business.,233,,
979,0.97,5191.319,5198.326,All items passed out of this committee will be forwarded to Monday June 14th for the full city council meeting.,233,,
980,0.97,5198.326,5201.563,"Council member Lewis, I look forward to discussing issues off line.",233,,
981,0.97,5201.563,5207.835,You can contact Eric and other folks and friends Glenn and team from FAS.,233,,
982,0.97,5207.835,5222.016,The next public assets and communities meeting scheduled for Friday July 9th at 2:00.,233,,
983,0.97,5222.016,5222.65,"With that, we stand adjourned.",233,,
984,0.97,5222.65,5229.991,Thank you everybody.,233,,
