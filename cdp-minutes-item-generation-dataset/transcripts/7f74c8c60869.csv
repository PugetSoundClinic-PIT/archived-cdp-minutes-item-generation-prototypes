115,0.97,2057.789,2075.006,Following the adoption of amendment a which we just did this--all the bargaining units who have agreed to these terms this front-line worker pay will go to eligible employees in the form of a lump sum payment of up to a maximum of $1750.,38,,
116,0.97,2075.006,2087.151,This is comparable to the total value of the Telework Stipends that have been--generally speaking city workers are eligible for either the Telework Stipend or the Front- line worker pay and cannot earn both benefits.,38,,
117,0.97,2087.151,2123.554,The estimated cost for additional pay to representative and Non- representative front-line workers is approximately $6.5 million and there are--to support this additional expense I do want to make sure that members of the viewing public and colleagues know that future legislation will have to come before the Council later this year or early next year to make appropriations to various city departments in order for them to execute the lump sum payments to eligible employees once we have a better sense of the full universe of those who are claiming.,38,,
