335,0.97,2016.614,2028.359,I was recently in public safety meeting in the Cid were a representative from SPD said they too welcomed the work that just care does.,70,,
336,0.97,2028.359,2037.135,"So, I don't know who isn't on board at this point, but I think this is really important work that goes beyond traditional outreach.",70,,
337,0.97,2037.135,2039.17,This is public safety work that doesn't involve the police.,70,,
338,0.97,2039.17,2048.679,"It's substance abuse treatment work, crisis intervention work, and it is housing connection and support work.",70,,
339,0.97,2048.679,2052.984,There is a real appetite for us to do something on all of these fronts.,70,,
340,0.97,2052.984,2057.588,That's a big part of the conversation we have been having in the last year in Seattle.,70,,
341,0.97,2057.588,2061.259,I have heard it over and over again that folks want this work done without police intervention.,70,,
342,0.97,2061.259,2067.398,"Without punitive consequences that move people from one place to the other, but don't actually accomplish anything.",70,,
343,0.97,2067.398,2069.801,People understand that that doesn't work.,70,,
344,0.97,2069.801,2077.108,"Showing up with a chuck, a Bulldozer, or a dump truck, isn't humane.",70,,
345,0.97,2077.108,2086.884,This is an option that really provides a model of care that has acute impacts for our community with minimal funds and support from the city.,70,,
346,0.97,2086.884,2094.792,They have been able to create a system that really has huge support across the city.,70,,
347,0.97,2094.792,2098.563,"I'm excited by the funds that we have appropriated, and am excited to see this work continue.",70,,
348,0.97,2098.563,2100.097,I'll just close by thanking both L.E.A.D.,70,,
349,0.97,2100.097,2102.733,And just care for the work they've done in my district.,70,,
350,0.97,2102.733,2110.241,Thanking Councilmember Lewis once again for highlighting the needs of these programs and Council colleagues who have cosponsor this.,70,,
351,0.97,2110.241,2115.546,I think it's our strong advocacy that is contributing to this work.,70,,
352,0.97,2115.546,2123.654,I look forward to having a strong partner in the executive office so that we can distribute funds allocated for just care in the future.,70,,
353,0.97,2123.654,2130.361,"As we all know, we can appropriate these funds, but we need to get the money to the providers.",70,,
354,0.97,2130.361,2134.765,My hope is that we will be able to do that once we get this signed.,70,,
355,0.97,2134.765,2135.066,Thank you.,70,,
356,0.97,2135.066,2139.137,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Morales.",71,,

361,0.97,2155.353,2158.99,I'm glad to see it here today because we know that just care works.,72,,
362,0.97,2158.99,2168.366,It is a proven solution to address homelessness with lasting results rather than Time-Limited results.,72,,
363,0.97,2168.366,2170.434,This is a program that we need throughout the city.,72,,
364,0.97,2170.434,2178.709,"I'm excited to see how we, and how quickly we can expand the services because we need these services.",72,,
365,0.97,2178.709,2182.246,"We need the just care program in green Lake and Fremont and Ballard, and throughout the city.",72,,

374,0.97,2207.271,2210.608,"Thank you, Council President.",74,,
375,0.97,2210.608,2221.552,"I had a question about, based on some comments I just heard, some questions of the sponsor about the bill and then quick comments, just a few sentences.",74,,
376,0.97,2221.552,2224.622,"The question I have, we talk about just care.",74,,
377,0.97,2224.622,2230.528,"I just want to make sure what we are talking about is the model, and not a particular vendor or provider.",74,,
378,0.97,2230.528,2233.064,Is that correct?,74,,
379,0.97,2233.064,2239.637,That could be one way that it could be interpreted.,75,,
380,0.97,2239.637,2244.275,We can't be too prescriptive.,75,,
381,0.97,2244.275,2252.984,"The bill does not pick a particular vendor, right?",75,,
382,0.97,2252.984,2260.391,"Not necessarily, but the people that have been bidding on this work have been the same consortium of providers.",75,,
383,0.97,2260.391,2267.064,"So, I would anticipate that it would probably end up being the consortium that the defender Association has convened.",75,,
384,0.97,2267.064,2270.101,It doesn't necessarily have to be.,75,,
385,0.97,2270.101,2272.97,Thank you.,76,,
386,0.97,2272.97,2276.507,"Council President, just a quick comment to close out.",76,,

388,0.97,2278.209,2283.714,I'll be voting yes on this ordinance.,76,,
389,0.97,2283.714,2288.185,I recognized the urgent need to house people experiencing homelessness.,76,,
390,0.97,2288.185,2299.13,"Placing them in hotels and other Non-Congregant shelter during the Covid pandemic is a promising, albeit temporary, solution during the current crisis.",76,,
391,0.97,2299.13,2311.142,"I'm supporting this investment of public dollars to make sure the investment of these public dollars is ultimately effective, regardless of which service providers get the funds, since this is not a Sole- source award.",76,,
392,0.97,2311.142,2320.951,"I would ask our human services Department to track the key Metrics such as the cost to house each person, and the key outcomes, such as the number of people Exiting to permanent housing.",76,,
393,0.97,2320.951,2321.919,I'll be voting yes on this.,76,,
394,0.97,2321.919,2322.753,Thank you.,76,,

396,0.97,2327.358,2331.462,Any additional comments before we close out debate?,77,,
397,0.97,2331.462,2332.93,I'm not seeing any other hands raised.,77,,
398,0.97,2332.93,2346.877,I also wanted to echo thanks to Councilmember Lewis for leading the charge as the chair of our homelessness committee.,77,,
399,0.97,2346.877,2350.748,"Really appreciate the leadership in this space and the opportunity to collaborate with you, Councilmember Lewis.",77,,
400,0.97,2350.748,2353.217,As one of the sponsors of this really important piece of legislation.,77,,
401,0.97,2353.217,2384.014,"We know that the model related to meeting the needs of people experiencing homelessness, that allows us to be nimble and not pursue sort of strategies that are law enforcement focused first, are really critical to our ability to successfully end homelessness and while this is a temperate solution, it is still a very important one to begin to connect people to the services and the housing that they need.",77,,
402,0.97,2384.014,2398.696,"So, I'm really excited about the opportunity to continue to invest in a model that really seems to have broad community support amongst constituencies that don't ordinarily agree with each other.",77,,
403,0.97,2398.696,2407.605,I think that the results that we are seeing from housing placements and service connection are very promising results.,77,,
404,0.97,2407.605,2429.16,"I'm excited to be able to continue to support investments, strategic investments in this area to continue to make a meaningful difference in the area of homelessness . with that being said, I am going to hand it over to Councilmember Lewis, who is going to close out debate and then we are going to vote on this bill.",77,,
405,0.97,2429.16,2431.362,"Thank you, Madam President.",78,,
406,0.97,2431.362,2433.264,I'll be brief here in closing it out.,78,,
407,0.97,2433.264,2437.668,Given everyone else's comments.,78,,
408,0.97,2437.668,2445.376,I've said it a couple times that I had a predecessor that used to have passing the C test.,78,,
409,0.97,2445.376,2449.847,It's an important component.,78,,
410,0.97,2449.847,2452.85,People that can see the tangible difference that something that we fund as having.,78,,
411,0.97,2452.85,2458.956,"Then, draw conclusions about whether that is making a difference in their lives are not.",78,,
412,0.97,2458.956,2466.463,"Unequivocally, this just care consortium during the pandemic has passed the see test.",78,,
413,0.97,2466.463,2492.122,"I receive more positive communication from provider advocates small business owners, from neighborhood residents, who are involved in this and to have really changed some of their core conditions and perceptions about how to solve the homelessness crisis through their expense of working with and interacting with just care.",78,,
414,0.97,2492.122,2495.526,Seeing how this approach and this model can work.,78,,
415,0.97,2495.526,2500.231,I just wanted to add a couple more sort of logistical things at the top.,78,,
416,0.97,2500.231,2505.97,There are many ways that this investment can be squared with our ultimate budget.,78,,
417,0.97,2505.97,2525.222,"I know this has been a little bit of a hiccup in funding this effort over the passed--over the course of the passed few months, based on interpretations of FEMA guidance and based on schedules of potential reimbursement for some of these dollars.",78,,
418,0.97,2525.222,2531.562,We have new information now that we didn't have when we initially passed this legislation.,78,,
419,0.97,2531.562,2544.275,We know that the general fund is recovering at a faster rate than we had initially anticipated when we did our last budget we have the benefit of a $10 million FEMA reimbursement insurance program.,78,,
420,0.97,2544.275,2546.911,Represented Macri passed in the last legislative session.,78,,
421,0.97,2546.911,2559.089,We have the benefit of knowing that there is going to be another big tranche of Federal money coming down the pipeline in 2022 that gives us some extra flexibility.,78,,
422,0.97,2559.089,2571.902,"Even since crafting this bill, we also have a little bit more assurance that Jumpstart is going to survive its legal challenges and be part of the fabric of our city budget.",78,,
423,0.97,2571.902,2574.805,There are ways we can square this obligation.,78,,
424,0.97,2574.805,2577.207,Of $12 million.,78,,
425,0.97,2577.207,2588.619,"That can be spent up front at the beginning of the summer, to make a noticeable difference and impact both for people experiencing homelessness, and people who have concerned about the Unsanctioned Encampments.",78,,
426,0.97,2588.619,2590.421,There are multiple ways we can remit this money.,78,,
427,0.97,2590.421,2599.196,The legislation allows for this money to be remitted through the contracts that King County has.,78,,
428,0.97,2599.196,2610.541,There would still be subject to the same reporting requirements but to take advantage of our relationship and partnership with King County to remit those dollars faster to get them out into the community.,78,,
429,0.97,2610.541,2629.426,"From my conversations with our counterparts at King County, that arrangement would be possible, if it is something the city needs to pursue to avoid administrative hurdles with are greatly appreciated and considerably overworked human services Department contractors.",78,,
430,0.97,2629.426,2639.036,"King County stands ready to be a strong partner, and I look forward to helping to establish that relationship if necessary to get this resource out into the community.",78,,
431,0.97,2639.036,2646.877,I do want to just finally think the coalition that Councilmember Gonzalez alluded to earlier.,78,,
432,0.97,2646.877,2656.487,"This effort has led to a letter that is now out in the world in the public record, where the Chamber of Commerce and the downtown Seattle Association appraising Councilmember Sawant for her leadership.",78,,
433,0.97,2656.487,2663.027,"So, it is clear we can do great things when great ideas come forward that can transcend some of the divides we have in the city.",78,,
434,0.97,2663.027,2680.978,"I want to thank the coalition that includes a downtown Seattle Association, and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, in addition to organizations representing arts, tourism, and service providers who have been clamoring for this kind of investment for a long time.",78,,
435,0.97,2680.978,2689.82,"With that, I think there will still be some additional work on the other side of passing this bill to hammer out some of the details and implementation.",78,,
436,0.97,2689.82,2694.825,I look forward to those conversations and I'm looking forward to voting on this.,78,,
437,0.97,2694.825,2697.094,"So, thank you.",78,,
438,0.97,2697.094,2700.531,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",79,,

530,0.97,3259.556,3273.303,I do think fundamentally it is appropriate to seek the use of local improvement districts for significant infrastructure changes.,100,,
531,0.97,3273.303,3283.113,That are going to have the benefit of the entire neighborhood as a whole at heart.,100,,
532,0.97,3283.113,3297.093,"We know there's going to be considerable improvement to the core of downtown, to the waterfront, and to the area around the Pikes place market from some of the investments that are going to be paid for partially through this L.I.D ..",100,,
533,0.97,3297.093,3315.145,"I do want to say, I know that there are cases out there of folks who are going to get caught in the boundaries of the local improvement district for payment to be a hardship.",100,,
534,0.97,3315.145,3316.446,The residential portion of the L.I.D.,100,,
535,0.97,3316.446,3321.251,As a whole is a fairly small portion.,100,,
536,0.97,3321.251,3323.286,This was useful information from the hearing that I attended.,100,,
537,0.97,3323.286,3330.76,"That it's about 20% of the $174 million, just to remind the general public, the L.I.D.",100,,
538,0.97,3330.76,3337.534,Is assessed to pay for about 49% of the improvements involved in this project.,100,,
539,0.97,3337.534,3346.276,51% of the improvements to be paid for with other taxes in the private Philanthropy.,100,,
540,0.97,3346.276,3349.279,I think it is important to flag that the residential portion of the L.I.D.,100,,
541,0.97,3349.279,3352.782,Is a fairly modest part of the overall project.,100,,
542,0.97,3352.782,3373.403,"I would certainly be interested in pursuing in the future, especially as we go through implementation and assessment, that if there are people reporting significant hardship over the course of the period where people are expected to pay into the L.I.D., the Council explore some kind of mitigation for the residential portion of the L.I.D.",100,,

546,0.97,3408.738,3414.244,"-- or, I have to agree that this L.I.D.",100,,
547,0.97,3414.244,3422.452,Has been conducted in a way that is squaring the law and the rules around how a L.I.D.,100,,
548,0.97,3422.452,3423.853,Assessment is carried out and implemented.,100,,
549,0.97,3423.853,3438.802,"For those reasons, I'm going to vote today on all three pieces of legislation and move forward on this project . I do want to fly going forward the residential portion of the L.I.D.",100,,
550,0.97,3438.802,3449.445,"Is something I would be interested in exploring future ways to mitigate over the tendency of the assessments in cases where there is real hardship, particularly for people who are on fixed incomes.",100,,

658,0.97,4052.681,4063.459,Misclassification is a high priority of our labor standards advocates.,135,,
659,0.97,4063.459,4065.494,Myself included.,135,,

663,0.97,4099.829,4112.208,"However, due to the pandemic we were not able to take up the recommendations early this year when my staff and Council central staff presented to them on the plans to take up their recommendations.",135,,

668,0.97,4139.435,4158.754,"Again, just very broadly, the bill includes a timely payment obligation for folks who are considered independent contractors.",135,,
669,0.97,4158.754,4172.368,"Not every person who is considered an independent contractor has been misclassified, but the timely payment obligation should be obligations that all workers receive, whether or not they work for an employer or are independently contracted.",135,,
670,0.97,4172.368,4203.432,"Then, also, the other obligations in the bill, obligations that require advanced notice to a contract employee about what the conditions are for which they will be receiving payment on the front end, and then on the back end, and explanation of why your payment--labor standards regular employees I think take for granted.",135,,
671,0.97,4203.432,4210.105,"In the area of our independent contracting, these are not standard obligations.",135,,
672,0.97,4210.105,4224.553,It's kind of information that an independent contractor looks at to help them determine whether or not there being misclassified as an independent contractor.,135,,
673,0.97,4224.553,4228.424,It allows them to either advocate for themselves as a worker.,135,,

677,0.97,4268.264,4278.407,That is intended to deal with concerns that we've heard from independent contractor Hairstylists whose only relationship with a salon is renting a space for work.,135,,

680,0.97,4307.036,4324.753,"This is a special authority that the Ols director has, unlike many departments of the city, to establish their authority so that they can directly identify what their budget needs are, and I have to go through the Mayor's office.",135,,
681,0.97,4324.753,4330.893,This is the way that the Council and the Mayor will deliberate on the enforcement costs associated with this bill.,135,,
682,0.97,4330.893,4338.467,It removes platform workers from many aspects of the bill.,135,,
683,0.97,4338.467,4340.769,"Although not for timely payment, those obligations still exist.",135,,
684,0.97,4340.769,4349.678,This was an amendment that Councilmember Strauss requested that I raise in his committee last weekend.,135,,
685,0.97,4349.678,4351.28,In committee last week.,135,,
686,0.97,4351.28,4354.583,Which I did so.,135,,

688,0.97,4357.319,4377.306,"Finally, and learning with the removal of platform dig workers from many of the aspects of the bill, it also States our interest as I Council on establishing minimum compensation and other protections like transparency for dig workers.",135,,

721,0.97,4557.686,4566.995,"I believe this bill is going to be instrumental in helping restaurants by ensuring their presence on delivery platforms is in their hands, and their control.",145,,
722,0.97,4566.995,4569.698,That it can continue to own the guest experience from beginning to end.,145,,
723,0.97,4569.698,4576.171,The guest expenses something restaurants worked very hard to build and execute.,145,,
724,0.97,4576.171,4588.984,"When restaurants are unwilling participants on a delivery platform that creates space for errors, mistakes and Misfires, that can and do affect the restaurant, and also negatively impact the delivery driver when a customer has a negative experience.",145,,
725,0.97,4588.984,4596.491,It is my hope that this will also help delivery drivers by allowing them to just focus on the delivery of food.,145,,
726,0.97,4596.491,4611.74,"When a restaurant is unable to participate, there may be an old, out of date menu Online for example, drivers become, the customer effectively and have to make an order on behalf of customers that they are bringing food to.",145,,
727,0.97,4611.74,4626.288,"So, this entire process of ordering, waiting for food, getting the flu to its delivery access, takes a lot of time and of course reduces income for a driver who has little or no protections or benefits.",145,,
728,0.97,4626.288,4638.767,This is especially made worse as this process can mean a lot of places were in order fails to meet expectations for customers despite being well executed by the people at the restaurant or the driver who brought the food to the customer.,145,,
729,0.97,4638.767,4645.54,"Driver should not have to suffer financially because of this, nor should restaurants take the hit when they have no idea that a customer is ordering from an out of date menu.",145,,
730,0.97,4645.54,4681.009,"Other businesses across the city have shared similar issues and experiences with platforms, some of those businesses include--my office in developing this legislation engaged with working Washington, teamsters, hospitality groups we also engaged with representatives from the delivery platforms directly and have also heard directly from of the restaurants, all of whom have expressed broad support for this piece of legislation.",145,,
731,0.97,4681.009,4683.578,This legislation is very narrowly focused.,145,,
732,0.97,4683.578,4689.518,On ensuring restaurants are willing participants in the delivery food world.,145,,
733,0.97,4689.518,4700.896,"Which we know now, and pandemic life, is become the new normal for so many of us here in Seattle.",145,,
