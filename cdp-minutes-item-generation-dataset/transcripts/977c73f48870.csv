291,0.97,1346.211,1354.152,"As a King County District 7 resident, I identified two important adjustments.",156,,
292,0.97,1354.152,1378.844,First we saw Councilmembers offering a down payment on removing the system of oppression supported by the Seattle police Department that Marginalizes black and Brown people and did this largely by cutting the Seattle police Department that does nothing but harm black and Brown Councilmembers.,156,,
293,0.97,1378.844,1387.085,The rainy day fund was established as a way to respond to unanticipated need in Seattle.,156,,
294,0.97,1387.085,1392.023,This is indeed a time of unprecedented need.,156,,
295,0.97,1392.023,1398.363,Jenny Durkan's veto of this budget is appalling and unassumed to your global situation.,156,,
296,0.97,1398.363,1407.038,I understand that Councilmember Lewis is on the fence about overriding Jenny Durkan's troubling veto to the proposed budget adjustment.,156,,
297,0.97,1407.038,1426.191,"I am calling on Lewis and other Councilmembers, particularly those with white privilege to invest in those and black and indigenous communities by holding Jenny Durkan accountable and overriding the proposed budget readjustment.",156,,

304,0.97,1443.542,1445.243,The Council has already approved of this.,158,,
305,0.97,1445.243,1448.413,There is no reason to be Backtracking.,158,,
306,0.97,1448.413,1462.394,You said stick firm with the decisions you have made to push for change in our city rather than having just done it per publicity reasons and become tracking.,158,,

312,0.97,1481.446,1495.36,I am Rebecca Smith and a constituent of team morale necessary district 2. I am calling for you to make a case to override Durkan's veto on the 2020 Rebalanced budget.,160,,
313,0.97,1495.36,1505.804,I would like to briefly member some Statistics I pulled from the Seattle.Gov Website about crime committed in Seattle in 2020.,160,,
314,0.97,1505.804,1511.176,"Of the total crime committed, 89% is property crime.",160,,
315,0.97,1511.176,1548.046,"Of that 89%, 99.5% of those crimes are larceny, theft, burglary, and motor vehicle theft all crimes committed due to a lack of access to resources, crimes due to a need, and then a look at the violent crime, 11% of the crimes committed in 2020, aggravated assault representing 21%, again, due to lack of access to mental health resources and robbery representing 32% of that, again, Crime-Based need.",160,,
316,0.97,1548.046,1562.16,So what I would like to shed light on is to call in police who are heavily armed and Militarized does not do anything to address the lack of resources Fueling the overwhelming majority of these crimes.,160,,
317,0.97,1562.16,1594.826,"But what we can do to address those issues directly is to Defund the police Department and Reallocate the money to vulnerable communities, specifically black communities to create programs that will give us access to resources, and in that way we can make a positive change and have a positive effect and decrease in crime.",160,,
318,0.97,1594.826,1595.126,Thank you.,160,,
319,0.97,1595.126,1601.733,Thank you for calling in.,161,,

330,0.97,1682.747,1689.788,I am incredibly disappointed and frustrated that the Council is considering not overriding the veto.,162,,
331,0.97,1689.788,1695.126,The package passed is the bare minimum.,162,,
332,0.97,1695.126,1701.099,This new package that was mentioned this morning is completely unacceptable.,162,,
333,0.97,1701.099,1707.405,It's completely Backtracking and watering down anything that would have an actual meaningful impact.,162,,
334,0.97,1707.405,1720.018,Not only is it fully inadequate but it comes out with such short notice that we the public barely have any time to read through it and form opinions.,162,,
335,0.97,1720.018,1730.195,The Mayor Retowed the 2020 rebalancing package a month ago but the Council has waited until the last moment to share where they stand.,162,,
336,0.97,1730.195,1739.337,Please don't disappoint us tomorrow and please override the Mayor's veto.,162,,

345,0.97,1792.457,1794.559,The homeless are living on top of each other.,163,,
346,0.97,1794.559,1807.272,That is not a way to curb the spread but increasing Quitted Covid because of the closeness.,163,,
347,0.97,1807.272,1808.573,Could you please take action.,163,,
348,0.97,1808.573,1813.378,Thank you so much.,163,,

386,0.97,2047.645,2069.267,It's clear that the Mayor's veto signals an unwillingness to address the deadly threat to the black and Brown and indigenous people and ignorance to the communicate programs that are desperately needed.,169,,
387,0.97,2069.267,2084.315,"If the Mayor continues to ignore the victims of the police violence, it's clear that the city council will override the veto and set about to work for the 2020 budget that fully responds to the needs of the people of Seattle.",169,,

1141,0.97,6241.635,6258.852,I want to thank Sdot and the budget office for beefing up the fiscal notes to show the public all the sources and usage of funds to know where the money is coming from and how it's spent more clearly.,561,,
1142,0.97,6258.852,6261.989,The sources and uses illuminate several points.,561,,
1143,0.97,6261.989,6268.261,"First, the good news is only 17% of the funding for the project is from the city tax dollars.",561,,
1144,0.97,6268.261,6275.269,The purpose of the legislation is to increase the amount coming from the city and to update the budget in general.,561,,
1145,0.97,6275.269,6287.914,This does have an impact to the project and the fiscal NOTE helps to Inexplain--explain that.,561,,
1146,0.97,6287.914,6296.69,I want to keep a close eye on any Sdot project to make sure it's managed correctly.,561,,
1147,0.97,6296.69,6298.825,I want to support the bill today.,561,,

1154,0.97,6341.001,6348.175,"Thank you, Council president and thank you Councilmember Pedersen for bringing this for the bus rapid transit project.",563,,
1155,0.97,6348.175,6350.444,It's a high priority for me.,563,,
1156,0.97,6350.444,6358.118,We know that Rapidride of Seattle and King County are not quite bus rapid transit.,563,,
1157,0.97,6358.118,6377.971,"Bus rapid transit have their own lines and they have been able to be successful with all the implements and meet the similar reliability of the Lightrail, just two or three minutes.",563,,
1158,0.97,6377.971,6386.58,"Transit has a reliability travel time from when you pick it up to where you are going and know how long it will take every time you ride the bus, then you are more likely to take it.",563,,
1159,0.97,6386.58,6400.694,And we need to have a little reliability within the city to have the buses arrive every 10 to 15 minutes on corridors such as Brt.,563,,
1160,0.97,6400.694,6411.004,"Eugene, Oregon has approved rapid transit, and they have been able to meet the frequent levels of service, but our city desperately needs this.",563,,
1161,0.97,6411.004,6414.708,And creating transit only lanes throughout the city is one way of doing that.,563,,
1162,0.97,6414.708,6418.011,And overall we need more projects like Madison Brt.,563,,
1163,0.97,6418.011,6420.814,So this ranks very high on my priority list.,563,,
1164,0.97,6420.814,6427.454,I'm happy to support it today and I look forward to supporting it more in the future.,563,,

1168,0.97,6435.295,6437.798,Thank you.,565,,
1169,0.97,6437.798,6452.546,So I really--I understand the importance of the Brt Rapidride G line project and I understand it was in the works for many years.,565,,
1170,0.97,6452.546,6462.222,I am glad to see $7.3 million additional funding and $4 million in savings available from the Landers Street Overpass project.,565,,
1171,0.97,6462.222,6470.53,Sdot gets the credit for managing the Landers Street Overpass project in a way that allows the funds to be reallocated.,565,,
1172,0.97,6470.53,6487.848,"I have concerns about the smaller funding source that has been in the works for many years, the Fauntleroy project that is included in the reallocation.",565,,
1173,0.97,6487.848,6509.202,"One constituent--when we actually voted on the reallocation in the 2020 rebalancing package under a separate vote to realigned CIP with the 2020 vote but when we took the vote earlier, a constituent reminded me that planning works for the project goes back 20 years.",565,,
1174,0.97,6509.202,6522.048,"The project originated with the community which is a pedestrian unfriendly city and in the very, very dense--increasingly dense area and urban advantage.",565,,
1175,0.97,6522.048,6538.398,"Last week I had to leave for another meeting and I wasn't able to bring this up during Committee, and thank you to chair Pedersen for doing so, and it's important to realize that 100% design for the Fauntleroy project was reached in fall 2017.",565,,
1176,0.97,6538.398,6555.649,I supported the delay of that project in January 2018 because the project overlapped with one of the options under consideration for sound transit rail project.,565,,
1177,0.97,6555.649,6557.517,"Subsequently, it was delayed to the project.",565,,
1178,0.97,6557.517,6572.732,But I only supported the delay of the project because we also received a very strong commitment from Sdot about the funds that had been allocated for the project.,565,,
1179,0.97,6572.732,6595.689,"And Sdot Fauntleroy project Website notes sound transit's decision on Lightrail alignment is the next step and they go on to say, and I quote we remain committed to the goals of the Fauntleroy project and the Seattle sound transact does not impact Fauntleroy we will move forward with the design.",565,,
1180,0.97,6595.689,6615.609,If the sound transit impacts Fauntleroy we will work with sound transit and align with the goals.,565,,
1181,0.97,6615.609,6629.255,These goals are a significant amount of the $13 million for the CIP project in the proposed--I believe they are going to make this the focus in the 2021 budget.,565,,
1182,0.97,6629.255,6635.195,The central staff estimates involve a $9 million Redirection.,565,,
1183,0.97,6635.195,6648.208,"So sound transit is scheduled for early next year and final Eif in 2022, and it seems very Preplay tour to Reallocate the funding in advance.",565,,
1184,0.97,6648.208,6657.817,I appreciate that Sdot did short-term improvements with the $13 million allocated for this area for transportation improvements in the area.,565,,
1185,0.97,6657.817,6672.365,They did so a couple of summers ago but they were intended as temporary improvements.,565,,
1186,0.97,6672.365,6682.475,I understand this is Transindental to the rapid ride and I want to make sure that I state my concerns and stance of the 2021 budget.,565,,
1187,0.97,6682.475,6704.631,I let Sdot know after the committee vote last week that my support for the Madison Brt fund is strong but that I was seeking a commitment from Sdot to reconsider the plan to divert between $9 to $13 million from the Fauntleroy project in 2021.,565,,
1188,0.97,6704.631,6721.915,"I believe in doing so is a real mistake and the community would feel, and I would as well, that a promise was broken if Sdot moves forward with what I Sunday the 2121 decision to divert the rest of those funds.",565,,
1189,0.97,6721.915,6722.215,Thank you.,565,,
1190,0.97,6722.215,6728.421,Are there any other comments on the bill?,566,,

1192,0.97,6729.722,6740.066,I wanted to thank Councilmember Herbold for bringing up the issue.,567,,
1193,0.97,6740.066,6778.238,"You know--I know we don't want to live in the austerity budget scenario, and there is a deficit and in the 2021 budget we'll have a lot of, let's say robust discussions on how to allocate funding and Councilmember Herbold, I will be happy to work with you if the project is negatively impacted and be happy to be an ally to find funding from other projects that may not be as much of a priority as Fauntleroy.",567,,
