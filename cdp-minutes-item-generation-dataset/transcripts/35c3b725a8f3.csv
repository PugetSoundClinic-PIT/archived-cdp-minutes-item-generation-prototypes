81,0.97,465.932,473.139,"The Commission plays a critical role in assuring transparency, accountability, in Seattle elections and government.",11,,

85,0.97,516.482,528.528,"The Commission's recently adopted emergency rule allowing campaigns to post democracy voucher replacement forms Online is, in my view, a great example of such a measure.",11,,
86,0.97,528.528,543.843,"As the lead assistant attorney general on the team defending governor Inslee's emergency response to the pandemic, I am eager and I think Well-Positioned to help the Commission find solutions to the challenges Covid-19 continues to pose to campaigns and voters alike.",11,,
87,0.97,543.843,554.52,It is critical that the Commission continue to remove barriers to full and equal electoral participation by our city's most marginalized communities.,11,,
88,0.97,554.52,558.824,This would be my number one priority as a Commissioner.,11,,
89,0.97,558.824,566.365,And it is especially urgent in the midst of a pandemic that is disproportionately harming people of color.,11,,
90,0.97,566.365,578.978,"For example, although participation in the pioneering democracy voucher program nearly doubled from 2017 to 2019, it remained disproportionately utilized by white, wealthy, and older Seattleites.",11,,
91,0.97,578.978,584.55,"It is, I think, essential to address those disparities in the city's signature election program.",11,,
92,0.97,584.55,590.156,I am deeply committed to that goal.,11,,
93,0.97,590.156,597.196,And more broadly to ping equity in the committee's work.,11,,
94,0.97,597.196,602.835,"The Attorney General's office, for example, I sued the previous Federal administration repeatedly.",11,,
95,0.97,602.835,612.878,"Challenging actions that in our office's view unlawfully discriminated against people of color, Lgbtq Americans, and other groups.",11,,
96,0.97,612.878,624.757,"I am most proud of my work on the case challenging the public charge law, which jeopardized the immigration status of millions solely Waysed on their receipt of minimal public benefit.",11,,
97,0.97,624.757,626.225,"Including food, housing or Healthcare.",11,,
98,0.97,626.225,632.832,"Before joining the Attorney General's office, I was a trial attorney in the U.S.",11,,
99,0.97,632.832,638.437,Department of civil rights division in the voting section.,11,,
100,0.97,638.437,659.058,"I worked closely with state, election and local administrator administrators.",11,,
101,0.97,659.058,667.9,"When I was in private practice, I had the tune to work on a variety of Election-Related matters.",11,,
102,0.97,667.9,676.175,"Including recounts and election context, challenges to racial and election Gerrymanders in other States and political elections for Washington State and local campaigns.",11,,
103,0.97,676.175,693.392,"I also had an active pro Bono practice, Partnering with the equal justice initiative in Montgomery, Alabama, to represent indigent.",11,,
104,0.97,693.392,699.899,Seeing that systemic and overt racism that my clients experienced shaped me profoundly as a lawyer.,11,,
105,0.97,699.899,712.478,"Deepening my resolve to eradicate discrimination in the legal system, and improve access to justice.",11,,
106,0.97,712.478,714.413,It would guide my service as a Commissioner.,11,,
107,0.97,714.413,716.315,Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself today.,11,,
108,0.97,716.315,722.888,And I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.,11,,

114,0.97,734.633,743.909,"As a former ethics and elections Commissioner myself, I can tell that you there's no shortage of work in that Commission.",12,,
115,0.97,743.909,757.823,And I had an opportunity to serve before the implementation of the democracy voucher program and many of the laws that I have personally sponsored to reform our local elections.,12,,
116,0.97,757.823,762.461,So there's a lot more work on the plate of the elections Commission.,12,,
117,0.97,762.461,766.031,I appreciate your willingness to serve in this additional capacity.,12,,
118,0.97,766.031,775.141,"Colleagues if you want to open it up for any questions you all might have, Mr. Jones.",12,,
119,0.97,775.141,777.843,Not seeing any questions.,12,,
120,0.97,777.843,784.884,So we'll go ahead and moving over to Kristen Hawes.,12,,
121,0.97,784.884,792.091,For an introduction and an opportunity to ask her any questions.,12,,
122,0.97,792.091,795.895,"Thank you, Council President Gonzcez.",12,,

125,0.97,796.929,797.496,Great.,14,,

127,0.97,805.804,813.579,I am also Enthused about the prospect of serving the city as a member of the Commission.,14,,
128,0.97,813.579,818.083,Like Zach I am a native Seattleite.,14,,
129,0.97,818.083,838.304,"So seeing the city change considerably over the course of my time here and also recognize that access to elections, equity, and representation are critical as the city moved for a in its Governance overall but particularly in the Postcovid era.",14,,
130,0.97,838.304,841.14,My background is a little bit different.,14,,
131,0.97,841.14,848.113,"I am an attorney, partner at summit law group.",14,,
132,0.97,848.113,849.081,Specializing in commercial real estate.,14,,
133,0.97,849.081,860.059,So I do a lot of work with clients of all sizes in that arena both in the city and outside of it.,14,,
134,0.97,860.059,864.663,"I come to you, the Commission, with legal training and a legal background.",14,,
135,0.97,864.663,873.138,"But also as part of, perhaps, the citizen volunteer in terms of someone who has a longstanding interest in government and politics.",14,,
136,0.97,873.138,880.379,And a specific interest in access to justice issues.,14,,
137,0.97,880.379,894.493,"As Mr. Jones indicated, he has served previously in the pro Bono and access arenas with respect to his career at DOJ.",14,,
138,0.97,894.493,895.894,I previously was a public defender.,14,,
139,0.97,895.894,903.769,So I have a sense of difficulties faced by many in terms of their experience of at least our legal system.,14,,
140,0.97,903.769,911.91,And the difficulties inherent in providing everyone with access and representation.,14,,
141,0.97,911.91,914.513,I have been a real estate attorney.,14,,
142,0.97,914.513,918.217,"And have seen as I mentioned, the city change, the challenges that the city faces.",14,,
143,0.97,918.217,933.699,"And I think in terms of adequately addressing those challenges, the work of the Commission will be crucial respect to enhancing representation.",14,,
144,0.97,933.699,937.002,I did have an extension conversation with Lane Barnett about this.,14,,
145,0.97,937.002,946.412,"And the work of the Commission, and moving those priorities forward.",14,,
146,0.97,946.412,949.782,And look forward to serve and assist in that capacity.,14,,

148,0.97,958.157,968.667,Now I have the opportunity since they are more self-sufficient.,14,,
149,0.97,968.667,972.271,The opportunity is there to do more with my public service.,14,,
150,0.97,972.271,975.407,So I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to serve the city I love in this capacity.,14,,
151,0.97,975.407,981.88,Thank you so much for that.,15,,
152,0.97,981.88,987.686,Any questions for Kristen?,15,,
153,0.97,987.686,991.89,"Council member Mosqueda, please.",15,,
154,0.97,991.89,993.158,"Oh, on mute.",15,,
155,0.97,993.158,995.694,"I was, like, Oh, no, my computer is freezing.",16,,

157,0.97,996.195,1000.799,Thank you again for your interest in serving.,16,,
158,0.97,1000.799,1015.314,"Council member--excuse me, Council President Gonzcez and I had the chance to really be the first city council members to use these democracy vouchers.",16,,
159,0.97,1015.314,1017.95,So I think they are great for staff.,16,,
160,0.97,1017.95,1028.227,And I look forward to continuing to work with all of you overall the way in which we can make elections more transparent and accessible.,16,,
161,0.97,1028.227,1029.828,And voting more accessible.,16,,
162,0.97,1029.828,1043.942,"I guess one of the questions that I have is do either of you--or do we happen to know the existing board members, which board members have experienced running elections before?",16,,
163,0.97,1043.942,1044.943,Or running campaigns.,16,,
164,0.97,1044.943,1051.049,My question comes from both wanting to make sure that we have people who have a commitment to social justice as you clearly do.,16,,
165,0.97,1051.049,1061.427,But also wanting to make sure that we lift up the lived experience of folks who have been trying to get more people actively engaged in initiatives.,16,,
166,0.97,1061.427,1061.727,And voting.,16,,
167,0.97,1061.727,1073.872,So can you speak with a little to that if you have it or if you happen to know other commissioners who bring that level of experience?,16,,
168,0.97,1073.872,1077.576,"Thank you, council member Mosqueda.",17,,
169,0.97,1077.576,1080.879,19 speak to the other commissioners' experience.,17,,
170,0.97,1080.879,1083.282,I wouldn't say I've ever run an election.,17,,
171,0.97,1083.282,1090.088,But our role was to lead teams of observers and election monitors from within DOJ and other Federal agencies all around the country.,17,,
172,0.97,1090.088,1102.868,"So I've had the opportunity to observe, kind of monitoring general procedures with detailed monitoring parameters.",17,,
173,0.97,1102.868,1114.213,And specifically with a focus on ensuring language access.,17,,
174,0.97,1114.213,1119.218,"So I've observed In-Person elections, of course, and our own By-Mail elections.",17,,
175,0.97,1119.218,1120.319,"California, New York, Texas.",17,,
176,0.97,1120.319,1121.42,A wide range of jurisdictions.,17,,
177,0.97,1121.42,1127.192,And I found that to be one of the most rewarding parts of the job.,17,,
178,0.97,1127.192,1129.528,No knock on By-Mail voting which has tremendous benefits.,17,,
179,0.97,1129.528,1142.04,But there is just something kind of magical about being in the polling place and seeing all these different people from different walks of life coming together and exercising this fundamental right.,17,,
180,0.97,1142.04,1144.943,And things went wrong on almost every election.,17,,
181,0.97,1144.943,1150.148,But nothing to the point that it was--shook the foundations of our democracy.,17,,
182,0.97,1150.148,1158.824,So that was a tremendously rewarding experience and I think gave me a perspective for election administration.,17,,
183,0.97,1158.824,1164.763,I hope that answers your question.,17,,
184,0.97,1164.763,1169.167,I also do not have experience running elections per se.,18,,
185,0.97,1169.167,1177.042,I volunteered and worked for candidates in VA jurisdictions.,18,,
186,0.97,1177.042,1179.178,When we lived in Western New York.,18,,
187,0.97,1179.178,1180.979,And more recently in Seattle.,18,,
188,0.97,1180.979,1186.251,But I have not run an election to your question.,18,,
189,0.97,1186.251,1187.319,That's fair.,19,,
190,0.97,1187.319,1194.393,And I haven't run many elections either.,19,,
191,0.97,1194.393,1199.998,I did before running for office.,19,,
192,0.97,1199.998,1201.3,Helped to write an initiative.,19,,
193,0.97,1201.3,1220.919,"I would encourage you both as you get onto these commissions, as you're considering issues to try to do some outreach to people who are running campaigns or running initiatives, to get direct feedback.",19,,
194,0.97,1220.919,1230.796,The smallest thing can be an impediment to making sure that diverse candidates get their word out or that voter participation can be expanded.,19,,
195,0.97,1230.796,1238.136,So recognizing Workgroups or Roundtables to pull that lived experience in would be I think a great addition to the experience you're bringing.,19,,
196,0.97,1247.279,1254.052,I had a general question about technology.,20,,
197,0.97,1254.052,1261.026,And how that plays into our local elections in particular under the democracy voucher program.,20,,
198,0.97,1261.026,1282.681,"I would be interested in hearing sort of your perspectives on innovation and on the sort of technology, in anything else, particularly in the context of Covid and the realities of Covid and how that will continue to impact our community.",20,,
199,0.97,1282.681,1285.017,For a good portion of the rest of the year.,20,,
200,0.97,1285.017,1298.397,Just talk to me a little bit about sort of your--I guess principles or experiences with how to utilize technology in the best way possible.,20,,
201,0.97,1298.397,1299.665,In the context of our local elections.,20,,
202,0.97,1305.304,1327.926,"I think with respect to the democracy vouchers, I've noticed in looking at the Website over the course of the last several elections, it has been broadened to include access via the information provided there.",21,,
203,0.97,1327.926,1337.536,"I think the potential struggle or issue--and frankly, this has been highlighted by Covid.",21,,
204,0.97,1337.536,1338.837,And the vaccine Rollout.,21,,
205,0.97,1338.837,1342.24,People's access to technology is not consistent.,21,,
206,0.97,1342.24,1344.309,Nor is it equitable.,21,,
207,0.97,1344.309,1353.552,"So if we have the Mail-In democracy vouchers, the resources available Online.",21,,
208,0.97,1353.552,1362.461,I think one of the things to the Commission will be working in the next few years to ensure that technology is perhaps enhanced and approved.,21,,
209,0.97,1362.461,1375.14,"But also in the process of focusing on technology, we don't Ick nor the fact that a lot of people don't have access via that means.",21,,
210,0.97,1375.14,1378.677,Or that that advice may be limited.,21,,
211,0.97,1378.677,1391.39,"So proceeding, I envision it proceeding along parallel paths to participation in both of those, or via both of those means.",21,,
212,0.97,1391.39,1403.201,"Yeah, and I echo Ms. Hawes's comments.",22,,
213,0.97,1403.201,1411.576,The paradox of election administration is the more secure elections are paper ballots has opposed to electronic machines hooked up to the Internet.,22,,
214,0.97,1411.576,1420.018,"I don't know interpret your question as related to election administration, per se which is kind of outside the per view of the Commission itself.",22,,
215,0.97,1420.018,1432.297,"But with respect to democracy vouchers, I think there are tremendous students to utilize technology in ways that help expand the program.",22,,
216,0.97,1432.297,1436.935,I mentioned the disparities in race and socioeconomic wealth.,22,,
217,0.97,1436.935,1454.152,There are also tremendous disparities in age in terms of the utilization of the democracy voucher program.,22,,
218,0.97,1454.152,1459.491,Voters under 30 participated only 3% of them turned into a democracy voucher.,22,,
219,0.97,1459.491,1473.939,"Obviously when you're dealing with, I guess that would be the Millennial generation, can kind of technological utilization you can do, whether it's social media or other Internet promotion, is likely to yield more benefit.",22,,
220,0.97,1473.939,1482.547,So I need to do more research to see what the Combhigz and its staff have already done to promote the program on social media.,22,,
221,0.97,1482.547,1485.283,I certainly know campaigns actively do so.,22,,
222,0.97,1485.283,1496.361,But I think that's certainly worth exploring as a strategy to generate more exciting and participation among Seattle's younger voters.,22,,
223,0.97,1496.361,1498.263,I appreciate that.,23,,
224,0.97,1498.263,1518.216,I would also just--I haven't heard either of you talk about this directly and want you to encourage you to as soon to be commissioners to not forget about permanent residents.,23,,
225,0.97,1518.216,1525.59,And that program is available to legal permanent residents and the numbers there are dismal in terms of usage.,23,,
226,0.97,1525.59,1539.838,"And in large part, it's because a little cumbersome get folks who ask for the vouchers and know that they're supposed to ask for the vouchers.",23,,
227,0.97,1539.838,1553.852,And that's an area where I think the Commission can do thick things to improve.,23,,
228,0.97,1553.852,1559.658,"That would really create more exclusive access to such a historic, one of a kind program in our country.",23,,
229,0.97,1559.658,1567.065,I would encourage you all to consider lifting up that particular access for this program.,23,,
230,0.97,1567.065,1572.137,"Yeah, thank you for pointing that out.",24,,
231,0.97,1572.137,1575.774,Any other questions or comments?,25,,
232,0.97,1575.774,1576.875,Not see anything hands raised.,25,,
233,0.97,1576.875,1584.482,"Michelle, do you have anything else to add?",25,,
234,0.97,1584.482,1586.284,I don't.,26,,
235,0.97,1586.284,1615.38,Torn say that we are so grateful for the service of these two candidates who are qualified and obviously have a personal passion to see Seattle have the very best and nationally recognized democracy voucher program as well as access to community and making sure that our elections are run as Transparently and fairly as possible.,26,,
236,0.97,1615.38,1619.417,"So thank you, counsel President Gonzcez and members, and we look forward to their confirmation.",26,,
237,0.97,1619.417,1619.918,Thank you so much.,27,,
238,0.97,1619.918,1623.121,I'm gonNA go ahead and make a motion.,27,,
239,0.97,1623.121,1627.892,"Council member, I move the committee recommend confirmation of appointments 1868 and 1869.",27,,
240,0.97,1627.892,1628.293,Is there a second?,27,,
241,0.97,1628.293,1630.028,Second.,28,,
242,0.97,1630.028,1632.13,Thank you so much.,29,,
243,0.97,1632.13,1634.132,It's been moved and Seconded.,29,,
244,0.97,1634.132,1636.701,To recommend confirmation of the appointments.,29,,
245,0.97,1636.701,1638.436,Are there any additional comments?,29,,
246,0.97,1638.436,1645.143,"Hearing no additional comment, will the clerk please call the Rolle on the committee recommendation that the appointments be confirmed?",29,,
247,0.97,1645.143,1645.71,[calling roll],29,,
248,0.97,1645.844,1656.321,"Four in favor, none opposed.",30,,
249,0.97,1658.189,1659.858,Thank you so much the motion carries.,31,,
250,0.97,1659.858,1665.296,And the committee recommendation that the appointments be confirmed will be sent to the April 19th city council meeting.,31,,
251,0.97,1665.296,1667.399,You all are welcome to tune into the meeting.,31,,
252,0.97,1667.399,1678.276,But you are not required to attend the full council meeting on April 19th at 2:00.,31,,
253,0.97,1678.276,1682.28,And I expect there will not be any issues with the final vote and confirmation.,31,,
254,0.97,1682.28,1686.351,"But for now, congratulations and thank you for your willingness to serve the city.",31,,
255,0.97,1686.351,1690.055,Thank you for your consideration.,32,,
256,0.97,1690.055,1697.195,Thank you very much.,33,,
257,0.97,1697.195,1703.968,Am the clerk please read item three into the record?,33,,
258,0.97,1703.968,1705.57,Agenda item number three.,34,,
259,0.97,1705.703,1709.607,Thank you so much.,35,,
260,0.97,1709.607,1709.908,Okay.,35,,
261,0.97,1709.908,1713.478,I'm really excited about this next agenda item.,35,,
262,0.97,1713.478,1726.391,"And as we all know, I'm sure that we are all fans of the levy that was administered by King County.",35,,
263,0.97,1726.391,1739.003,"Had when it was first placed on the ballot, I was an early Endorser of this really important levy that serves so many of our families and kids.",35,,
264,0.97,1739.003,1767.999,So we are pretty unique compared to many other jurisdictions across the country in that we as both the city and the county are willing to tax ourselves in addition to the taxes that we pay that fund our public schools to support really critically important childhood development and Education-Based interventions and strategy strategies.,35,,
265,0.97,1767.999,1776.875,Going to provide us with a briefing on the best starts for kids levy renewal efforts that are underway over at the King County Council.,35,,
266,0.97,1776.875,1795.26,So I just want to again echo my thanks to King County executive Darryl Constantine for the tremendous work that they did in getting this passed in the first place.,35,,
267,0.97,1795.26,1800.298,And you for all the amazing administration that we've done here.,35,,
268,0.97,1800.298,1806.171,So I'm gonNA go ahead and hand it over to you to introduce yourself and walk us through your presentation.,35,,
269,0.97,1806.171,1806.504,Wonderful.,36,,
270,0.97,1806.504,1811.409,Thank you so much.,36,,
271,0.97,1811.409,1818.316,"And thank you, Council members.",36,,
272,0.97,1818.316,1820.351,Sheila Cappistani for the record.,36,,
273,0.97,1820.351,1823.555,And I have a very large Powerpoint.,36,,
274,0.97,1823.555,1825.356,Hopefully you all will have access to the information.,36,,
275,0.97,1825.356,1833.097,But really I just want to go over some of the higher level information.,36,,
276,0.97,1833.097,1836.334,I believe it is being shared by you all.,36,,
277,0.97,1836.334,1845.81,I think Lee has it and it starting to share it now.,37,,
278,0.97,1845.81,1847.145,All right.,38,,
279,0.97,1847.145,1851.249,This is a wonderful exercise for me.,39,,
280,0.97,1851.249,1857.555,I kind of have Co issues.,39,,
281,0.97,1857.555,1857.989,This is wonderful.,39,,
282,0.97,1857.989,1862.727,Next slide.,39,,
283,0.97,1862.727,1866.097,No slide.,39,,
284,0.97,1872.37,1873.738,There we go.,40,,
285,0.97,1873.738,1874.072,Wonderful.,41,,
286,0.97,1874.072,1874.572,Thank you so much.,41,,
287,0.97,1874.572,1883.982,I always love to show this slide when I am doing presentations because this guides everything that we do with access for kids.,41,,
288,0.97,1883.982,1893.691,And it's become a part of the county's mission and vision for itself in general as we talk about this.,41,,
289,0.97,1893.691,1895.727,We started off with a really long vision statement.,41,,
290,0.97,1895.727,1902.5,"And over the first year as the levy advances forward, we kept hearing happy, healthy, safe, and thriving.",41,,
291,0.97,1902.5,1916.08,"So all of our babies or children, youth, young adults, parent, families and commune.",41,,
292,0.97,1921.686,1925.023,"Next slide, please.",41,,
293,0.97,1925.023,1925.523,So our current levy.,41,,
294,0.97,1925.523,1932.63,I wanted to go over to let you know what the framework is as we move into what our renewal look looks like.,41,,
295,0.97,1932.63,1941.439,"With the first levy proceeds, since it was the first time this levy was passed, we knew we would start collections in January, 2016.",41,,
296,0.97,1941.439,1944.642,But without having to approve the Clementation plan.,41,,
297,0.97,1944.642,1952.75,"So with the first work in collections, some of those started a youth and family homeless prevention project with about $20 million.",41,,
298,0.97,1952.75,1955.62,And that was to be spread out over the six years.,41,,
299,0.97,1955.62,1959.057,"With the remaining amount, this is how the funds were divided.",41,,
300,0.97,1959.057,1965.33,So 50% of the levy went toward what we call investing early in our prenatal to five.,41,,
301,0.97,1965.33,1968.066,35% went to sustaining again by the 24th.,41,,
302,0.97,1968.066,1979.043,We knew from the research and what our community told us that getting that deep investment in the earliest part was going to be the way that we would provide the healthiest foundation for our children.,41,,
303,0.97,1979.043,1991.789,"But we also understood that if we did not say the things we in those early years, children could lose ground.",41,,
304,0.97,1991.789,1995.159,10% to wrapping communities around our kids.,41,,
305,0.97,1995.159,1996.06,Communities matter.,41,,
306,0.97,1996.06,2001.799,We have a program called opportunity in partnership with the Seattle foundation and that was 10% of this levy.,41,,
307,0.97,2001.799,2007.405,And 5% going toward data and evaluation.,41,,
308,0.97,2007.405,2008.206,"Next slide, please.",41,,
309,0.97,2008.206,2015.213,I'm not gonNA go deeply into this but wanted to show the full initiative.,41,,
310,0.97,2015.213,2018.483,We have a theoretically framework that is Nrnth everything that we do.,41,,
311,0.97,2018.483,2031.629,This framework is one that we put together based on both science and research that we knew about--around what was person about serving children and young people.,41,,
312,0.97,2031.629,2038.703,And from the extensive community outreach and partnership that we did.,41,,
313,0.97,2038.703,2044.175,We put those two bodies of knowledge together and came up with a theoretical framework.,41,,
314,0.97,2044.175,2054.052,"Essentially what this says is that if we increase the good and decrease the bad, we'll get to healthy development and well being for our children.",41,,
315,0.97,2054.052,2063.895,"So increasing Promotive and protective factors, reducing risk factors would allow us to get to this healthy development.",41,,
316,0.97,2063.895,2071.269,If you could actually map all of the strategies I'm gonNA talk about next to one of these DOT points on this list.,41,,
317,0.97,2071.269,2076.841,So it brings together the full initiative.,41,,
318,0.97,2076.841,2077.575,Next slide.,41,,
319,0.97,2077.575,2081.946,"In our pre to 5 investment, they really focus on these as overall strategies.",41,,
320,0.97,2081.946,2092.69,What we're looking at is babies with families at the center.,41,,
321,0.97,2092.69,2100.198,And the next circle out is how do we create community support and peer support around new parents and new little ones.,41,,
322,0.97,2100.198,2105.803,"And the next one out, who else spends time with our children Besides parents?",41,,
323,0.97,2105.803,2107.305,Our Childcare providers.,41,,
324,0.97,2107.305,2112.61,And then other providers who come in contact Úwith children at this point.,41,,
325,0.97,2112.61,2114.812,And then the biggest Circ cell coming out to our system.,41,,
326,0.97,2114.812,2121.586,What kind of supports can we provide the system with that families have to move within.,41,,
327,0.97,2121.586,2124.522,We're looking at public health services.,41,,
328,0.97,2124.522,2130.228,Home-Based services for new families.,41,,
329,0.97,2130.228,2130.828,Developmental health.,41,,
330,0.97,2130.828,2131.729,Services.,41,,
331,0.97,2131.729,2135.032,And really identify people who might be experiencing some delays.,41,,
332,0.97,2135.032,2138.236,We also invested in our early support system.,41,,
333,0.97,2138.236,2143.04,Community-Based parenting and peer support.,41,,
334,0.97,2143.04,2148.813,"And that next circle, Childcare implementation and workforce development, incremental health.",41,,
335,0.97,2148.813,2153.551,Really about creating a system so people know where they can go when they need assistance.,41,,
336,0.97,2153.551,2155.653,"Next slide, please.",41,,
337,0.97,2155.653,2162.527,Our five to 24 investments are really grouped around this--strategies.,41,,
338,0.97,2162.527,2172.17,"And I won't read everything on this slide, but they cluster around youth development.",41,,
339,0.97,2172.17,2172.703,School partnerships.,41,,
340,0.97,2172.703,2173.538,Family and community connection.,41,,
341,0.97,2173.538,2174.939,And transitions to adulthood.,41,,
342,0.97,2174.939,2181.179,"For all of our kids, these are the letters.",41,,
343,0.97,2181.179,2193.357,Then we have a significant investment in our strategies around direct services for young people who are caught up in the system.,41,,
344,0.97,2193.357,2202.5,And some funding for some work to change the system that is actually putting our children into this peril.,41,,
345,0.97,2202.5,2205.002,"Next slide, please.",41,,
346,0.97,2205.002,2214.011,Measuring success is an essential part is also to make sure we are measuring and achieving the outcomes that we set out to achieve.,41,,
347,0.97,2214.011,2218.316,And we're using a National-Based model.,41,,
348,0.97,2218.316,2221.419,Essentially we are asking three questions for all of our programs.,41,,
349,0.97,2221.419,2230.528,"How much do we do, how well kid we do it, and anybody better off?",41,,
350,0.97,2230.528,2234.699,We've checked data.,41,,
351,0.97,2234.699,2242.44,We're asking the data for all the we have.,41,,
352,0.97,2242.44,2243.741,Secondary Carters which are more immediate.,41,,
353,0.97,2243.741,2249.413,This headline Carter may not be able to see for another few years.,41,,
354,0.97,2249.413,2251.549,But the secondary Carters.,41,,
355,0.97,2251.549,2268.232,And then we have performance measures for every organization that we contract with.,41,,
356,0.97,2272.937,2283.28,We have funded and are Partnering with 360-Plus community partners to administer 654 programs.,41,,
357,0.97,2283.28,2295.793,"We're provided or our community consultants have provided about 7,000 hours for our commune partners.",41,,
358,0.97,2295.793,2301.899,"With our assistance support, we've trained 24,000 Healthcare providers, Childcare providers and health workers.",41,,
359,0.97,2301.899,2318.883,"When you include communities of opportunity in these numbers, and the numbers of people who have attended their leadership workshops, this number goes up to significantly almost 200,000 leaders and providers in our community.",41,,
360,0.97,2318.883,2328.225,"And then just to talk a little bit about certificates and the city of Seattle, we have a lot of program partners and programs in Seattle.",41,,
361,0.97,2328.225,2335.399,80-Plus partners that we funded and 85-Plus programs that we have funded through Bsk.,41,,
362,0.97,2335.399,2339.503,Our Seattle partners are funded in nearly every one of the kids best strategy areas.,41,,
363,0.97,2339.503,2355.252,And a lot of this work has started partnerships with the city's deal and with Seattle public schools.,41,,
364,0.97,2355.252,2356.353,So proposed levy.,41,,
365,0.97,2356.353,2359.156,There's several aspects to this they wanted to go over.,41,,
366,0.97,2359.156,2361.659,We really want to maintain what we're doing.,41,,
367,0.97,2361.659,2366.464,And we also know that we're just in the beginning of getting those results.,41,,
368,0.97,2366.464,2373.571,So much work went into figuring out working with our communities and having a community designed strategy come through.,41,,
369,0.97,2373.571,2379.477,So we want to make sure that we maintain that good work that our communities have done to help us.,41,,
370,0.97,2379.477,2388.586,"So keeping the framework of investing early, sustaining the game, our opportunity program and homelessness prevention.",41,,
371,0.97,2388.586,2393.09,We also want to build upon what we're doing.,41,,
372,0.97,2393.09,2402.7,So we heard very clearly from our communities that we needed to deepen our investment in our School-Aged children and in our youth and young adults.,41,,
373,0.97,2402.7,2407.405,So we're proposing a deepening investment in programs that will focus on five to 12 year-olds.,41,,
374,0.97,2407.405,2413.31,Deepen our investment in School-Based health centers.,41,,
375,0.97,2413.31,2414.311,And deepen our investment.,41,,
376,0.97,2414.311,2425.623,"So those young folks, 18 to 24, who may have had a difficult time getting through the school system.",41,,
377,0.97,2425.623,2438.068,So offering alternate education and high school completion and on the secondary and Postsecondary and employment support.,41,,
378,0.97,2438.068,2441.939,Finally we proposed a new investment in Childcare.,41,,
379,0.97,2441.939,2449.38,"This would create a new Childcare subsidy program for King County to make Childcare more affordable for 3,000 low-income children and their families.",41,,
380,0.97,2449.38,2459.156,"The program would be working closely with the city of Seattle and with the state as we all--and the Feds as well, as everyone is paying attention right now to Childcare and what we need to be doing.",41,,
381,0.97,2459.156,2468.365,So that we leverage this to really assure that all of our families have the access that they need to Childcare.,41,,
382,0.97,2468.365,2472.87,We'll also be establishing a new Childcare wage project.,41,,
383,0.97,2472.87,2482.88,That looks at supplementing the wage of Childcare workers.,41,,
384,0.97,2482.88,2488.252,We know that Childcare workers are some of the most underpaid workers in our County.,41,,
385,0.97,2488.252,2492.389,They tend toward being women and ten toward being men of color.,41,,
386,0.97,2492.389,2505.202,This really helps us push forward our equity commitment.,41,,
387,0.97,2505.202,2506.904,Those proposals were based on what the executive transmitted.,41,,
388,0.97,2506.904,2509.874,That has been approved by the regional policy Council.,41,,
389,0.97,2509.874,2512.61,And approved by the whole King County counsel.,41,,
390,0.97,2512.61,2517.081,So we're looking forward to that going for a final vote to electronic Council.,41,,
391,0.97,2517.081,2530.427,There was an Seamed that was accepted in both Committeeses that came through RPC that would take some of the investments that are somewhat extra.,41,,
392,0.97,2530.427,2535.499,"So a couple of friends talk about when we transmit the economic forecast, it would be about $800 million.",41,,
393,0.97,2535.499,2556.52,"The new forecast says it will be about $872 million wonderful some of that additional funds now we'll be adding to capital projects so folks who are running Youth-Serving organizations, Childcare, housing would have access to both new buildings.",41,,
394,0.97,2556.52,2557.254,Funding.,41,,
395,0.97,2557.254,2559.857,And improvements on the current funding.,41,,
396,0.97,2559.857,2560.591,"Next slide, please.",41,,
397,0.97,2560.591,2568.632,There were several other amendments that came through but that's the biggest one within the framework.,41,,
398,0.97,2568.632,2575.973,We also have the data where we will be providing data by zip code.,41,,
399,0.97,2575.973,2579.977,So this is a Sick-Year property tax levy.,41,,
400,0.97,2579.977,2583.881,On the at $0.19 per thousand dollars.,41,,
401,0.97,2583.881,2589.853,Which is pretty average in a King county home.,41,,
402,0.97,2589.853,2592.089,"It's about $1,400 per Homeowner.",41,,
403,0.97,2592.089,2601.865,And the economic projected revenue went from $811 million from August to $872 million in March.,41,,
404,0.97,2601.865,2602.232,That may be it.,41,,
405,0.97,2602.232,2603.634,Okay.,41,,
406,0.97,2603.634,2603.934,Thank you.,41,,

409,0.97,2613.31,2614.778,"Cleanings, any questions or comments?",42,,
410,0.97,2614.778,2620.718,I know some of you serve on the regional policy committee Sochlt this is probably--looks very familiar to you all.,42,,
411,0.97,2620.718,2629.193,But I did want to give us an opportunity to weigh in.,42,,
412,0.97,2629.193,2630.694,I'm not seeing any hands raised.,42,,
413,0.97,2630.694,2635.432,"She'Lla, I want to thank you for being with us today.",42,,
414,0.97,2635.432,2650.314,I think it'll help to inform the public conversation and the decision-making on the resolution that we're gonNA consider momentarily to support the best arts for kids levy efforts at King County.,42,,
415,0.97,2650.314,2653.951,So I appreciate you being here today.,42,,
416,0.97,2653.951,2659.023,I'm especially excited about our renewed Checkive focus on Childcare capacity.,42,,
417,0.97,2659.023,2669.266,Both from the Childcare provider perspective and also from the facilities.,42,,
418,0.97,2669.266,2680.778,And I'm particularly excited with the opportunity to address some pretty significant impacts to our Childcare network system both in Home-Based Childcare and in Center-Based Childcare.,42,,
419,0.97,2680.778,2682.646,It was an issue before Covid.,42,,
420,0.97,2682.646,2684.982,And it's become even worse now during Covid.,42,,
421,0.97,2684.982,2689.386,It's gonNA take us a while for us to recover.,42,,
422,0.97,2689.386,2695.993,But it is perhaps a unique moment in time to be able to leverage all of these dollars.,42,,
423,0.97,2695.993,2706.87,Regionally and federally to really make a difference.,42,,
424,0.97,2706.87,2717.181,"Which is gonNA be a key strategy for us in terms of economic recovery, and also just the right thing to do for our kids and our families.",42,,
425,0.97,2717.181,2718.082,"Yes, thank you.",43,,
426,0.97,2718.082,2726.49,"Colleagues, are there any other questions or comments on this before we say goodbye to Sheila here?",44,,

440,0.97,2791.989,2809.406,So this resolution is designed to lift up and support the efforts of the best art for kids renewal and affirm the city's support for King County's efforts in terms of this renewal that will come before voters very soon.,47,,

446,0.97,2855.619,2857.554,The Seattle preschool program levy.,48,,
447,0.97,2857.554,2864.661,"The city recognizes that despite these valuable investments, widespread educational inequities still exist within Seattle.",48,,
448,0.97,2864.661,2883.68,"The next is focused on selection and recognition that partnership with others, including students, family, educators, Community-Based organizations, cultural organizations and governmental partners is essential to supporting the development and education of the city's children and youth.",48,,
449,0.97,2883.68,2890.754,The following nine recitals describe the existing levy that was approved in 2015.,48,,

456,0.97,2929.226,2942.839,"And Lastly, the legislation resolves with the Mayor and the city council's support for renewal of levy for the purpose of funding prevention and early intervention strategies to improve the health and well being a children, youth, families.",48,,

476,0.97,3071.635,3080.544,A singular opportunity to expand access to high-quality care and invest in the workforce at a time when Childcare is absolutely critical to our economic recovery from Covid.,50,,

538,0.97,3318.415,3323.82,We'll also include some outcome data from the 2018 Cohort.,60,,
539,0.97,3323.82,3330.026,As well we're gonNA present the result about the Seattle promise racial equity Toolkit.,60,,
540,0.97,3330.026,3347.944,"And the last time we were here, we presented to the committee about the promise program back in December.",60,,
541,0.97,3347.944,3352.415,"And Council, you all had endorsed our steps.",60,,
542,0.97,3352.415,3353.249,Flexibility legislation then.,60,,
543,0.97,3353.249,3361.524,Which gave our promise dollars the flexibility to request part-time labors and receive promise of support for up to three years.,60,,
544,0.97,3361.524,3369.165,So that was in response to our Covid-19 impact.,60,,
545,0.97,3369.165,3370.266,To their learning.,60,,
546,0.97,3370.266,3371.768,"Next slide, please.",60,,
547,0.97,3371.768,3380.043,"Here at deal, we do everything--or should I say everything we do here at deal is rooted in results.",60,,
548,0.97,3380.043,3381.478,And the results we hope to achieve.,60,,
549,0.97,3381.478,3387.083,What you'll hear today connects to our fourth departmental result right there.,60,,
550,0.97,3387.083,3396.192,"And that is that really all Seattle students obtain a Postsecondary degree, credential or some type of certificate.",60,,
551,0.97,3396.192,3416.012,"And with that, I'm gonNA hand it off to my team just to guide you through today's presentation.",60,,
552,0.97,3416.012,3418.681,"Can we have the next slide, please?",61,,
553,0.97,3418.681,3420.016,One more time.,61,,
554,0.97,3420.016,3420.316,Okay.,61,,
555,0.97,3420.316,3430.527,"Just as a reminder, the goal for Seattle promise is that all students have access to and opportunities even at the most specific credential or degree.",61,,
556,0.97,3430.527,3434.531,But specifically we have three outcomes.,61,,
557,0.97,3434.531,3437.5,"One is Seattle promise, credential or degree or transfer.",61,,
558,0.97,3437.5,3441.271,Number two is Seattle promise delivers high-quality services.,61,,
559,0.97,3441.271,3446.443,And clears pathways to success.,61,,
560,0.97,3446.443,3452.916,And the third outcome is tune after close.,61,,
561,0.97,3452.916,3456.219,And here is the Seattle promise program model.,61,,
562,0.97,3456.219,3460.29,It has three components.,61,,
563,0.97,3460.29,3461.357,The preparation phase.,61,,
564,0.97,3461.357,3468.765,Where seniors are eligible to apply for the Seattle promise.,61,,
565,0.97,3468.765,3482.879,And outreach specialists with the hope that they are prepared and knowledgeable and support them to ensure that they enroll as a Seattle promise student in the fall.,61,,
566,0.97,3482.879,3490.987,They have specialists quarterly to ensure that they're connected to resources and also have opportunities with the new opportunity promise Internship.,61,,
567,0.97,3490.987,3494.991,Ultimately with the goal that they get their degree.,61,,
568,0.97,3494.991,3496.492,"The next slide, please.",61,,
569,0.97,3498.795,3510.607,"And just as another kind of Context-Setter, in 2008, South Seattle colleges launched the 13th year scholarship program.",62,,
570,0.97,3510.607,3515.812,"In 2017, Mayor Durkin signed the executive promise order.",62,,
571,0.97,3515.812,3520.783,"And in 2019, the Seattle promise program officially began as Seattle promise.",62,,
572,0.97,3520.783,3527.79,"In 2020, that levy funded Seattle promise.",62,,
573,0.97,3527.79,3540.403,It was eligible for all Seattle graduates from 17 high schools in Seattle.,62,,
574,0.97,3540.403,3549.846,"You know where the name of the program was, the fund source, the high schools in which we're eligible to participate in the Seattle promise program.",62,,
575,0.97,3549.846,3552.715,In particular the green is focused on the high school class of 2018.,62,,
576,0.97,3552.715,3559.822,And that is where we're going to see the deep dive of what happened with class of 2018.,62,,
577,0.97,3559.822,3563.559,To understand their experience in Seattle promise.,62,,
578,0.97,3563.559,3568.131,So we're also closely monitoring that classroom 2019.,62,,
579,0.97,3568.131,3569.532,And the class of 2020.,62,,
580,0.97,3569.532,3573.57,And then we'll dive into what to expect for the class of 2021.,62,,
581,0.97,3573.57,3583.546,This coming fall.,62,,
582,0.97,3583.546,3591.955,"Last we spoke, in the fall, there were 846 students at Seattle promise.",62,,
583,0.97,3591.955,3592.588,First or second year students.,62,,
584,0.97,3592.588,3597.56,You can go to the next slide.,62,,
585,0.97,3597.56,3603.299,This is winter we had 668 students return for the winter of 2020.,62,,
586,0.97,3603.299,3608.705,There were remote learning supports provided for our students.,62,,
587,0.97,3608.705,3623.019,"We also had 2,100 prompt applications for our high school class of 2021.",62,,
588,0.97,3623.019,3641.738,"This class, they're expected to complete applications, participate in the Academy, they have to graduate from high school and participate in a summer program before they enroll in the fall as a Seattle promise scholar.",62,,
589,0.97,3641.738,3651.347,"Next slide, please.",62,,
590,0.97,3651.347,3655.585,I mentioned there were 668 promise scholars enrolled.,62,,
591,0.97,3655.585,3658.821,That is an 80% retention from fall to winner.,62,,
592,0.97,3658.821,3665.161,And I also show that First-Year and Second-Year breakdown we Cohort.,62,,
593,0.97,3665.161,3670.666,We have in 2020 there were 699 First-Year students.,62,,
594,0.97,3670.666,3674.37,And 565 students return.,62,,
595,0.97,3674.37,3678.975,That's about a 79% retention rate.,62,,
596,0.97,3678.975,3683.579,And it's been a little retention pattern experienced by a Success-Year students.,62,,
597,0.97,3683.579,3688.351,We do not have data for students of color or part-time students.,62,,
598,0.97,3688.351,3691.754,We're working with our Seattle college partners to ensure that we get that data.,62,,
599,0.97,3691.754,3694.557,We can expect that data in May.,62,,
600,0.97,3694.557,3695.491,And also in spring.,62,,
601,0.97,3695.491,3702.699,We typically get this data from our partners in summertime.,62,,
602,0.97,3702.699,3710.306,So we expect an update in the summer for spring data.,62,,
603,0.97,3710.306,3711.207,Council member.,62,,
604,0.97,3711.207,3713.81,"Go ahead, council member Mosqueda.",63,,
605,0.97,3713.81,3717.58,Thank you very much.,64,,
606,0.97,3717.58,3722.719,I see just the Aggregated data comment here.,64,,
607,0.97,3722.719,3729.592,"Just wanted to confirm, are we able to get this Aggregated data in the Latino category?",64,,
608,0.97,3729.592,3733.329,And also in the Ati category?,64,,
609,0.97,3733.329,3739.735,"So at deal, we encourage--we have multiple.",65,,
610,0.97,3739.735,3744.941,Platforms where we give data.,65,,
611,0.97,3744.941,3748.845,"Early learning, SPs, and the Seattle public college data platforms.",65,,
612,0.97,3748.845,3759.355,"The last I spoke with Seattle colleges, they were creating a Workgroup.",65,,
613,0.97,3759.355,3767.63,There wasn't that many differences within the groups when I started this.,65,,
614,0.97,3767.63,3772.268,That local specificity was being collected by the city colleges.,65,,
615,0.97,3772.268,3777.974,Also understanding that they are responding to the technical board.,65,,
616,0.97,3777.974,3787.416,So they main have the data systems to be able to check the level of data that we were.,65,,
617,0.97,3787.717,3803.466,"The data that we're expecting, may 2021, will or will not have data for Latinx and a, it I populations aggravated?",66,,
618,0.97,3806.235,3809.305,Our hope is we will.,67,,
619,0.97,3809.305,3822.318,But it's--it'll be Disaggregated by the way Seattle colleges decides to give the data.,67,,
620,0.97,3822.318,3822.919,Okay.,68,,
621,0.97,3822.919,3831.027,"And when we get the report in May of 2021, that decision will be made clear?",68,,
622,0.97,3831.027,3832.829,So that we can understand?,68,,
623,0.97,3832.829,3834.23,The conference data collection?,68,,
624,0.97,3834.23,3836.833,Yep.,69,,
625,0.97,3836.833,3837.533,Thank you.,70,,
626,0.97,3837.533,3844.807,Great question.,70,,
627,0.97,3844.807,3851.247,And we'll also get part-time status information in May.,70,,
628,0.97,3851.247,3854.45,"So here is a table, there's a lot going on here.",70,,
629,0.97,3854.45,3860.556,So I'm gonNA take a few seconds to kind of explain it.,70,,
630,0.97,3860.556,3866.262,"We're looking at all the Cohort data from 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.",70,,
631,0.97,3866.262,3873.069,This Cohort data allows us to track trends over each of these as we get data.,70,,
632,0.97,3873.069,3879.942,2018 is the first full Coletter where we have complete two-year data for the program.,70,,
633,0.97,3879.942,3883.145,"In 2019, we will also have a full set of data.",70,,
634,0.97,3883.145,3885.047,But that will be until summer.,70,,
635,0.97,3885.047,3893.289,"And in 2020, which is what I just spoke about, is that one of our more recent and largest promise students.",70,,
636,0.97,3893.289,3900.296,And in 2021 right now we're at a place where we've collected over applications.,70,,
637,0.97,3900.296,3905.201,And this is the largest application to date.,70,,
638,0.97,3905.201,3915.311,And we expect a larger enrollment this coming fall.,70,,
639,0.97,3915.311,3919.615,You'll notice that they're doing the text on screen.,70,,
640,0.97,3919.615,3924.62,This is where we class our fall retention numbers.,70,,
641,0.97,3924.62,3931.127,2016 had a 61% retention from fall to fall.,70,,
642,0.97,3931.127,3938.934,To date we have 29% of the students that started have completed their degree.,70,,
643,0.97,3938.934,3939.936,This is as of summer.,70,,
644,0.97,3939.936,3951.113,"So we still expect once we get new data in May, we'll update.",70,,
645,0.97,3951.113,3951.714,I also.,70,,
646,0.97,3951.714,3954.55,To list the Cohort 29 team.,70,,
647,0.97,3954.55,3957.954,We have 26 students who have finished their degree early.,70,,
648,0.97,3957.954,3968.664,This is one we will continue to update if I get an opportunity.,70,,
649,0.97,3968.664,3976.672,"The other reason we look at the data this way, it allows us to look at previous Coverts.",70,,
650,0.97,3976.672,3983.079,If your retention number is going up or going down.,70,,
651,0.97,3983.079,3997.593,"Within the 2020 Coletter, the 21% is lower than in the previous two Cohort cohorts.",70,,
652,0.97,3997.593,4008.104,So this is something that we'll want to monitor and dive deeper as we get more data and learn more information.,70,,
653,0.97,4008.104,4016.612,"Next slide, please.",70,,
654,0.97,4016.612,4022.685,We know that the 2018 Coletter is the only one that has two cohorts worth of data.,70,,
655,0.97,4022.685,4025.087,So this is worth exploring.,70,,
656,0.97,4025.087,4034.83,"The insight committee has dug into these numbers to understand what's happening in the enrollment, the preparation and the completion.",70,,
657,0.97,4034.83,4053.649,"Here what we found when we looked at enrollment by race and gender, the Cohort who has 76% students of color, the largest group were black males within the largest race and gender group that represented 15% of the Cohort.",70,,
658,0.97,4053.649,4060.556,And the Cohort was pretty balanced within the Jeshd breakdown.,70,,
659,0.97,4060.556,4061.557,Gender breakdown.,70,,
660,0.97,4061.557,4065.861,"The next slide, please.",70,,
661,0.97,4065.861,4075.07,"To understand how our students were entering the Seattle college system, we looked at how many students that were requiring develop courses.",70,,
662,0.97,4075.07,4083.546,And we found over 63% of students that entered were taking a math or reading or writing development course.,70,,
663,0.97,4083.546,4089.351,The largest group taking developmental cores were black and Latinx students.,70,,
664,0.97,4089.351,4092.555,In particular the males.,70,,
665,0.97,4092.555,4099.895,When we found 70% of black and Latino needs were experiencing.,70,,
666,0.97,4099.895,4105.568,Asian and white students were less likely to take on the courses is.,70,,
667,0.97,4105.568,4109.205,"Next slide, please.",70,,
668,0.97,4109.205,4118.481,"So here we're looking at the persistence from fall, year one, all the way to spring year two.",70,,
669,0.97,4118.481,4127.723,And we found that half of the 20 Cohort remained in Seattle promise for the full three-year program.,70,,
670,0.97,4127.723,4144.406,"You can start to see that within each supporter that passed, Reat the same time numbers were different by racial group.",70,,
671,0.97,4144.406,4149.612,The Latinx group featured the strongest.,70,,
672,0.97,4149.612,4158.154,And Latinx groups were left within two years in compared to the Asian group that experienced 89 supporters of the same.,70,,
673,0.97,4164.46,4169.665,The other thing that we looked at were completion rates.,71,,
674,0.97,4169.665,4172.735,We found 24% of common scholars completed their research between two years.,71,,
675,0.97,4172.735,4183.979,"As you saw in the preparation and the persistence, this actually impacts the completion.",71,,
676,0.97,4183.979,4192.655,Where we noticed racial disparities between the completion degree.,71,,
677,0.97,4192.655,4203.832,Asians were more likely to earn a degree within two years.,71,,
678,0.97,4203.832,4207.57,Developmental courses plays a role.,71,,
679,0.97,4207.57,4211.307,So the other thing we did were looking at the data.,71,,
680,0.97,4211.307,4213.576,We had to just compare nationally.,71,,
681,0.97,4213.576,4215.211,How does that compare locally.,71,,
682,0.97,4215.211,4218.047,And how does that compare with the Seattle colleges that are full-time?,71,,
683,0.97,4218.047,4229.592,We looked at the fall to fall retention.,71,,
684,0.97,4229.592,4231.627,"A two-year, 24% completion rate.",71,,
685,0.97,4231.627,4240.636,We looked at comparison groups that had similar promise programs that had advising success support.,71,,
686,0.97,4240.636,4246.642,And we found Seattle promise performed better but trailed the programs in the fall to fall Retech.,71,,
687,0.97,4246.642,4259.355,"When you look at the two-year completion rate, we saw that it was pretty comparable to even more status programs.",71,,
688,0.97,4259.355,4260.556,And also more recent programs like San Diego promise.,71,,
689,0.97,4269.298,4276.038,"Okay, so to summarize, I just want to bring back to the group, this is only one full two-year Cohort analysis.",72,,
690,0.97,4276.038,4285.18,2019 will have data this summer that we'll be able to take another deep dive to look at trends.,72,,
691,0.97,4285.18,4292.388,I do want to add that Covid-19 will impact student analysis.,72,,
692,0.97,4292.388,4303.265,"And the 2018 program to 2020 program growth, we'll are to provide more context.",72,,
693,0.97,4303.265,4311.674,"So the enrollment, demographics may shift and you'll want to monitor that I do also want to acknowledge that enrollment has been tripled.",72,,
694,0.97,4311.674,4319.915,"And based on what we're seeing, we expect the enrollment to be growing.",72,,
695,0.97,4319.915,4322.918,"And with that, I will pass it off to Dana Harrison.",72,,
696,0.97,4324.653,4326.221,Thank you.,73,,
697,0.97,4326.221,4340.336,"Before we get to Dana, are there any questions about the first part of the presentation?",73,,
698,0.97,4340.469,4341.537,Take it away.,73,,
699,0.97,4341.67,4346.942,Okay.,74,,
700,0.97,4346.942,4347.342,Thank you.,74,,
701,0.97,4347.342,4348.243,"And good afternoon, everyone.",74,,
702,0.97,4348.243,4354.85,I'm gonNA speak a little bit about the racial equity Toolkit analysis and the recommendations that came from the team.,74,,
703,0.97,4354.85,4358.721,You can go ahead and advance to the next slide.,74,,
704,0.97,4358.721,4374.67,"And one thing I'll just remind you of as we start, I'll say this once more before we finish is that the data that you just saw, the 2018 Cohort data was not at the end of April for the racial equity Toolkit team to review.",74,,
705,0.97,4374.67,4379.975,They done have access to awful the same information that we do today.,74,,
706,0.97,4379.975,4388.083,So we continue to build our understanding about how and what to do with program implementation data to date.,74,,
707,0.97,4388.083,4394.289,So just a quick reminder of what the racial equity Toolkit analysis is and does.,74,,
708,0.97,4394.289,4410.205,"I think you all are familiar from our times before you in the past and what you know of our director, deal is very committed to the goals of the race and social justice initiative.",74,,
709,0.97,4410.205,4413.709,And that includes the state's racial equity Toolkit.,74,,
710,0.97,4413.709,4416.779,Between our Programatic and policy decisions along the way.,74,,
711,0.97,4416.779,4423.385,So we work to minimize harm and maximize the benefit for Seattle's community was color.,74,,
712,0.97,4423.385,4445.841,"We Queue early on that with the Seattle promise program being in its infancy, that we needed to take advantage of an early opportunity to analyze the initial program design to make sure that it would continue to be in a position to achieve our racially equitable Outcomecomes.",74,,
713,0.97,4445.841,4449.244,So a team was convened to conduct this analysis.,74,,
714,0.97,4449.244,4455.717,"That included 19 members that represented city perspectives, college partner perspectives and the voices of many community members as well.",74,,
715,0.97,4455.717,4466.762,They began their work in November of 2019.,74,,
716,0.97,4466.762,4469.031,Concluded in 2020.,74,,
717,0.97,4469.031,4473.569,Getting perspective from participants and community members along the way.,74,,
718,0.97,4473.569,4479.007,"In their work, they analyzed three different areas and considered three different elements which I'll detail in just a moment.",74,,
719,0.97,4479.007,4484.446,All of which had the potential to impact the equity of the program and its delivery outcomes.,74,,
720,0.97,4484.446,4491.753,"And at the conclusion of their work, the team submitted a set of recommendations to deal's work consideration.",74,,
721,0.97,4491.753,4498.694,"You can go ahead and advance, please.",74,,
722,0.97,4498.694,4503.498,Those three areas of analysis included eligibility expansion.,74,,
723,0.97,4503.498,4504.6,Continuous enrollment.,74,,
724,0.97,4504.6,4505.367,And program support services.,74,,
725,0.97,4505.367,4513.775,"And on the slide that you see, you see the different elements considered in each of those areas.",74,,
726,0.97,4513.775,4529.524,"For eligibility expansion, we looked at the inclusion of tunes, charter school graduates, Nontraditional diploma recipients and students picking up Ged's.",74,,
727,0.97,4529.524,4542.004,"In terms of continuous enrollment, the team looked at part-time enrollment, and the impacts of sat's, a Qualifier for financial aid.",74,,
728,0.97,4542.004,4545.14,"On the program support services, I won't read every single one to you.",74,,
729,0.97,4545.14,4549.044,You'll have a chance to look at them again in the report that you received.,74,,
730,0.97,4549.044,4559.254,"But here, there were the most elements that we were considering knowing from our experience to date as well as our research into other promise programs across the country.",74,,
731,0.97,4559.254,4564.76,How critical that reference program support is to students' success and completion.,74,,
732,0.97,4564.76,4579.675,"Of those 14 elements, I do want to note that three of them, opportunities, chatter schools, and part-time enrollment, were required or called out for review in the levy implementation plan.",74,,
733,0.97,4579.675,4590.085,And five were identified as particular interests to the Council or specific Council members.,74,,
734,0.97,4590.085,4591.82,"You can advance, please.",74,,
735,0.97,4591.82,4598.694,So here is a very brief Snapshot of the recommendations that deal received.,74,,
736,0.97,4598.694,4606.668,"And in total, you'll see on the far right-hand side that the team identified six items as High-Priority actions.",74,,
737,0.97,4606.668,4609.071,And two as medium.,74,,
738,0.97,4609.071,4611.306,And the remainder as well.,74,,
739,0.97,4611.306,4617.579,"In their Prioritization, the team took into consideration, the need to identify the private community.",74,,
740,0.97,4617.579,4623.185,"And that of the promised racial equity Toolkit team, as well as the overall impact on the program.",74,,
741,0.97,4623.185,4626.421,And the ability to implement recommendations in a timely manner.,74,,
742,0.97,4626.421,4632.928,Knowing that some of these would take more planning and development than others.,74,,
743,0.97,4632.928,4643.205,"The items elevated for action included expanding program eligibility, addressing student preparation and the need for developmental course work.",74,,
744,0.97,4643.205,4646.641,As well as increasing the Affordability of the program.,74,,
745,0.97,4646.641,4651.913,We're gonNA go into some of these recommendations in more detail in just a moment.,74,,
746,0.97,4651.913,4665.794,"But before I do, I just want to ground us in the Timeline and various conversations that happened around the set of recommendation recommendations.",74,,
747,0.97,4665.794,4671.466,Please keep in mind that the team didn't have access to awful the data you were able to see around the 2018 Cohort.,74,,
748,0.97,4671.466,4680.575,And they did have some access but not to the same robust level that we've been able to evaluate with our Stakeholders since then.,74,,
749,0.97,4680.575,4686.181,And in addition obviously is the bulk of the work happening during the pandemic.,74,,
750,0.97,4686.181,4702.597,So that had some implications for what and how they did their work.,74,,
751,0.97,4703.265,4712.107,"So since receiving the recommendations from the team in early December, deal has been engaged with our committee oversight community members.",74,,
752,0.97,4712.107,4718.647,"Reviewing data shared by Dr. Fahardo just a moment ago, and other Implementations.",74,,
753,0.97,4718.647,4736.098,"In our conversations throughout the first quarter of the year, we definitely have taken into consideration the impact of the pandemic on promise students' experiences as well as the budget resource.",74,,
754,0.97,4736.098,4750.545,"And as we move into quarter two, we anticipate further engagement with our city leaders as we're doing today with you all as well as many more conversations with our levy oversight Committee in the months ahead.",74,,
755,0.97,4750.545,4770.966,And all of that will hopefully give us a COB collusion by the end of the secondary conclusion by then of the second quarter by actions we'll be able to pursue in the 21/22 academic year.,74,,
756,0.97,4770.966,4777.372,So here is similar to what you just saw in terms of the summary.,74,,
757,0.97,4777.372,4784.079,The addition here is the city is Dlshting how to purpose Federal Covid relief and Rec resources.,74,,
758,0.97,4784.079,4798.093,And at deal we definitely believe that Postsecondary education and Affordability are part of economic recovery.,74,,
759,0.97,4798.093,4801.596,And we Advertently put forward some of the originations for use of Federal resources.,74,,
760,0.97,4801.596,4809.538,And those are five that you see flagged here.,74,,
761,0.97,4809.538,4824.186,"So I'll just briefly call out in terms of our advocacy for Federal resources, to support these recommendations, we're naming the path to regain eligibility as a possible action.",74,,
762,0.97,4824.186,4832.727,"Action to support academic preparation, course work, covering college fees for students with income criteria meeting.",74,,
763,0.97,4832.727,4835.397,Eligibility requirements that you see there.,74,,
764,0.97,4835.397,4850.111,"The Prioritization of tuition support, and student support staff ratios.",74,,
765,0.97,4850.111,4866.061,"Here in terms of tuition support, the rent teenagers how should tuition support be Prioritized if more students enroll in Seattle promise than there is funding allocated?",74,,
766,0.97,4866.061,4877.172,"As we go over the implementation plan for this levy, we had to do a lot of Forward-Thinking and planning for what we anticipate as student participation would be.",74,,
767,0.97,4877.172,4886.448,"I will name that just this past fall, we welcomed our largest class of students to date.",74,,
768,0.97,4886.448,4887.882,And definitely exceeded our projected enrollment.,74,,
769,0.97,4887.882,4894.556,"And also to be shared, we got the largest number of applications to date for the current senior class.",74,,
770,0.97,4894.556,4900.895,"And if our trends continue, that will put us over a projected ruling next fall as well.",74,,
771,0.97,4900.895,4903.265,But this is a great program to have.,74,,
772,0.97,4903.265,4906.201,It means that students are interested in the program.,74,,
773,0.97,4906.201,4911.606,Students and families are seeing the benefits and spreading the word.,74,,
774,0.97,4911.606,4919.514,"And we're really starting to develop a college learning culture in our city, which are all great things.",74,,
775,0.97,4919.514,4931.426,"So in terms of the recommendation received, the team has indicated that you all and our college partners continue to monitor this closely.",74,,
776,0.97,4931.426,4933.395,They've named it as a priority medium.,74,,
777,0.97,4933.395,4937.499,"And the Timeline, it could start as early as this fall.",74,,
778,0.97,4937.499,4942.57,The tricky part of Timeline on this one is that we almost have to be a year ahead.,74,,
779,0.97,4942.57,4959.921,Where we're notifying high school students of the eligibility criteria.,74,,
780,0.97,4975.236,4989.084,And this is certainly something that we anticipate.,74,,
781,0.97,4989.084,4998.193,The next action that we're recommending or seeking the use of Federal funds to support is around academic preparation and developmental course work.,74,,
782,0.97,4998.193,5009.104,"Here are the question answered was as a system, how can we reduce the need for students to take developmental course work?",74,,
783,0.97,5009.104,5014.809,We're seeing high percentages of our students of color enrolling in these particular courses.,74,,
784,0.97,5014.809,5025.086,"And while the Seattle promise does fund their participation in most courses, it doesn't count toward their program completion.",74,,
785,0.97,5025.086,5041.536,"So when we think about the 90 credit limit and their ability to achieve their educational goals within the two-year Timeline, we need to take developmental, the need to take developmental courses certainly has an impact on that.",74,,
786,0.97,5041.536,5049.244,Here the racial equity Toolkit team strongly recommended as a high priority that we develop a systemic plan across institutional partnerships.,74,,
787,0.97,5049.244,5054.149,To think about how to address this challenge.,74,,
788,0.97,5054.149,5061.489,It's certainly not something that develops just in a single year.,74,,
789,0.97,5061.489,5068.463,It has long-term ramification ramifications.,74,,
790,0.97,5068.463,5071.733,"And here our Lwell, C has had many conversations about this.",74,,
791,0.97,5071.733,5073.868,It was a high priority for them.,74,,
792,0.97,5073.868,5098.56,They are very interested in reducing the need for environmental course work so we can support students and different types of program models that allow them to do more than one credit earning opportunities at a time.,74,,
793,0.97,5099.661,5118.079,"Some immediate actions that we're exploring and ways to address this alongside and in collaboration with our institutional partners at Seattle public schools and the colleges, thinking about the readiness Academy, and the summer bridge experience.",74,,
794,0.97,5118.079,5122.484,Particularly for the 2021 class who was coming out of their senior year now.,74,,
795,0.97,5122.484,5127.322,Hoping to enroll in promise in the fall.,74,,
796,0.97,5127.322,5134.662,We're looking to interact with some opportunities so they begin their fall experience and course work to the extent possible.,74,,
797,0.97,5134.662,5157.352,We're also looking to learn from different programs across the country and best practices that we know and which the college has been exploring around first quarter classes to adapt to better meet the needs of students who were enrolling these types of courses.,74,,
798,0.97,5157.352,5168.396,"That might include some Corequisite remediation or specific course pathways, particularly around math for students entering into this type of course.",74,,
799,0.97,5168.396,5172.767,And also thinking about how we support students once they're enrolled into success and completion.,74,,
800,0.97,5172.767,5187.849,And this is everything that happens in that support services.,74,,
801,0.97,5187.849,5190.685,Go ahead.,74,,
802,0.97,5190.685,5201.262,"This recommendation around staff support ratios, the question considered was should student support staff ratios be modified?",74,,
803,0.97,5201.262,5212.207,"So as a reminder, the current program model puts one outreach specialist, which are our high school support personnel, to about 300 high school students.",74,,
804,0.97,5212.207,5213.174,And one retention specialist.,74,,
805,0.97,5213.174,5220.481,Which are our personnel at the college level to 100 promise scholars.,74,,
806,0.97,5220.481,5225.386,"And again, this is an initial program design based on the best available information at the time.",74,,
807,0.97,5225.386,5232.627,And here the Toolkit team recommended that we continue to monitor this at a medium priority.,74,,
808,0.97,5232.627,5254.349,"And here while we know that the promise is designed as a universal access program, we also know that promise students have unique needs.",74,,
809,0.97,5254.349,5269.03,This also includes making sure that we're responsive to the feedback that we're hearing from students along the way about the types and methods that are most helpful to them.,74,,
810,0.97,5269.03,5274.269,And learning from successful promise models across the country and sometimes in our own region.,74,,
811,0.97,5274.269,5283.878,There was a study just last summer that indicated that promise programs are having a tremendous amount of success in terms of completion rates for participating students.,74,,
812,0.97,5283.878,5289.684,Is that because of the types of supports that they contribute.,74,,
813,0.97,5289.684,5307.802,Whether that be through staff support models or also through coordinated student experiences and peer Mentorship experiences to make sure they have connected relationships to help them persist.,74,,
814,0.97,5307.802,5310.004,"Go ahead and advance, please.",74,,
815,0.97,5310.004,5324.719,"So college fees here for those that might be less familiar, in addition to tuition costs, there are also typically called enrollment fees that come up for students each quarter.",74,,
816,0.97,5324.719,5326.721,That they're enrolling in college course work.,74,,
817,0.97,5326.721,5334.629,So here the team considered the question should college fees be covered under the Seattle promise?,74,,
818,0.97,5334.629,5337.598,And the recommendation came out as a medium priority.,74,,
819,0.97,5337.598,5345.506,That you figure out how to cover the mandatory and general fees for income qualifying students.,74,,
820,0.97,5345.506,5358.553,"So currently the equity scholarship that's offered through the Seattle promise is for students who have a zero fee, which is the family contribution based on their financial aid package.",74,,
821,0.97,5358.553,5371.566,"And for students that qualified, they receive up to $1,500 for year that they can use flexibly to cover whatever it is that helps them persist in their educational pursuits.",74,,
822,0.97,5371.566,5384.645,"But for students who have an income above that contribution level, we don't currently have through the Seattle promise model a financial support for that.",74,,
823,0.97,5384.645,5401.095,"So this recommendation would expand the eligibility to include students who up to $1,000 Fdfc.",74,,
824,0.97,5401.095,5409.303,"And rounding this out, so here, the path to eligibility is a question that was considered by the racial equity Toolkit team.",74,,
825,0.97,5409.303,5414.308,Was should a formal Pathway to retain eligibility be developed for Studentses?,74,,
826,0.97,5414.308,5420.081,And will recommendation was yes.,74,,
827,0.97,5420.081,5423.885,Coming in as a high priority.,74,,
828,0.97,5423.885,5427.221,There are a series of milestones that students meet along the way.,74,,
829,0.97,5427.221,5438.8,And we tend to see from our initial applicant pool all the way to completion drops along the way for various reasons.,74,,
830,0.97,5438.8,5442.637,We do know that continuous full-time enrollment is coordinated to higher completion rates.,74,,
831,0.97,5442.637,5450.411,There are many opportunities that would benefit from an opportunity to regain eligibility because of circumstances that come up.,74,,
832,0.97,5450.411,5458.152,"And this year especially, Covid we know has had a pretty wide impact on students' ability to maintain eligibility.",74,,
833,0.97,5458.152,5468.362,Even with the allowance of the modifications that we made last fall there are many students that might benefit from a path back into the program.,74,,
834,0.97,5468.362,5471.833,So they can continue pursuing their educational goal.,74,,
835,0.97,5471.833,5480.007,And here we would need to work closely with our college partners to develop what that Pathway looks like.,74,,
836,0.97,5480.007,5482.376,And all the parameters that come with it.,74,,
837,0.97,5482.376,5489.65,But that could start as early as this fall for students that are near the end of their program.,74,,
838,0.97,5489.65,5492.086,"And with that, I feel like I just talked a lot.",74,,
839,0.97,5492.086,5494.488,I'm sure there are lots of questions along the way.,74,,
840,0.97,5494.488,5501.162,So I'm gonNA turn it over to Dwayne from next step.,74,,
841,0.97,5501.162,5502.73,But also welcome any questions.,74,,
842,0.97,5505.233,5505.533,Great.,75,,
843,0.97,5505.533,5509.403,Thank you so much.,75,,
844,0.97,5509.403,5512.673,Realy appreciate that.,75,,
845,0.97,5512.673,5521.582,"I am happy to sort of--if any Council members have any question, you're welcome to raise your hand in the zoom feature.",75,,
846,0.97,5521.582,5529.757,I know we are continuing to have conversations with the chair of our budget committee.,75,,
847,0.97,5529.757,5539.133,And I know she and I have been having AIL of conversations from the executive.,75,,
848,0.97,5539.133,5543.838,And continuing to have those conversations in the Finance and ruling committee.,75,,
849,0.97,5543.838,5551.145,Particularly as it relates to putting dollar ALLS to each one of these proposed priorities.,75,,
