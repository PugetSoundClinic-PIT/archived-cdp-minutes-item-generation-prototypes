6,0.97,146.112,173.606,Hearing no objection the agenda is now adopted .

So first I'm going to turn it over to deputy director Penny G and director handy from central staff to WAL us through this procedural aspects to Orient folks as to what is on the agenda for today,5,,
7,0.97,173.606,184.183,Thank you and good morning.,6,,
8,0.97,186.553,364.297,I'm happy to report today that this is the final step in the deliberation of the 23-2024 budget . If you can move on to the next slide? there are six items for committee consideration . The first is an amendment to make a technical Correctional action that the city voted to approve last week this is making a correction or the wrong fund was selected so the overall spending does not change it was just a technical correction was necessary for us to balance . There also clerk files to make a final recommendation . This is where the Mayor's proposed budget and capital improvement project AR filed and where the changes are also filed . So this is not voting to approve or disapprove of any changes it's just voting to approve the filing of the clerk files . and then finally there to counsel budget items the comprise of legislation ultimately adopt the 2020 budge and endorse the 2024 budget . I included the updated attachment to the Council bill on today' agenda . that includes everything that the Council has made on the budget here . for the final Council action there three pieces of budget legislation up for consideration . 24 of those 28 pieces are proposed to be on the consent calendar and will B acted on with one vote unless one gets removed for individual consideration . The budget adoption ordinance and the endorsement resolution will be considered individually and that is typically where they make final comments about the proposed put budget and then following those items of the final votes on the property TA bills they give voted after it is adopted . before the committee acts on the final technical budget items I wanted to return us where we started this conversation in terms of the balancing package and future Sustainability for the general fund . This is been an ongoing conversation with the Finance Committee and the select budget committee . This is about the general fund at on .6 billion of the city budget.,6,,
9,0.97,364.297,415.181,And this is where the city has the greatest flexibility and funding . on this chart the blue line is expected expenditures and the Redline is projected revenues . The first slide shows the executive proposed budget and what the projected general fund cap was . with an average operating gap of about 190 million dollars . the next slide is the final package for the counsel . You will recall two weeks ago in the initial Packag was here it shows an average operating gap of about 250 million . After all amendments were considered were things AR edited is the projected gap of about 214 million . This is primarily due to the revenue forecast of the counsel receive in November . So there are a Fe things to note that there is an ongoing project to decrease in general fund revenue so that makes the operating gap worse.,6,,
10,0.97,415.181,462.261,Overall the actions that this committee took as a body decreases the ongoing spending compared to the Mayor's Proposa by about 2 million per year . S that is Absents the negative forecast update in November an the counsel actions would have slightly narrowed the gap . in the end the counsel budget action and spending budget proposed by the counsel did not increase the ongoing expenditures . not compared to the Mayor proposed . I am happy to answer any questions or you can go ahead and move into actions.,6,,
11,0.97,462.261,486.986,Thank you so much . do any Council members have any questions on the presentation from central staff? okay .

87,0.97,1195.294,1220.018,Thank you chair . I appreciate the hard work of the Mayor's office in the city budget office and other Variou departments to craft a budget a well as the long hours invested by the budget chair and legislative staff to mend this budget . My team and I work hard and in good faith to get here.,66,,
88,0.97,1220.018,1281.113,It has become clear that there is more at stake regarding public safety today . I believe the city budget after two month of discussion and amendments to do more for public safety and not less . While I appreciate th hard work to find the human service programs to benefit Seattle and our district I believe the city council budget amendments went too far in lowering the original priority of public safety and can undermined efforts to recruit and retain police officers and detectives as Seattle is struggling with 91 response times and crime rates . While I join my colleagues supporting several levels of this budget cannot in good conscience endorse of final budget I believe fails to learn from recent public policy and mistakes for public safety and fall short on public safety for a third year in a row . I will be voting no on this final budget . I look forward to working with the Mayor and my counsel colleagues next year to make sure that the blue the budget does fully fund public safety.,66,,
89,0.97,1281.113,1290.322,Councilmember?,67,,
90,0.97,1290.322,1296.695,Yes . I will be voting no on items five and six on today's agenda which approved the budge as a whole for 2023 and 2024.,68,,
91,0.97,1296.695,1342.074,This is a brutal budget keeping in mind that this is on top of the chronic Underfunding of the needs of working people and vulnerable communities for over a decade . Despite the rhetoric implying this was inevitable it would be totally unnecessary ha they had the political will to increase a big business tax as the people's budget campaign in my office have proposed . only two of eight on the city Counci voted yes on the proposal to make sure that taxes on big businesses are increased by a minuscule amount in order to fund the immediate needs of working people . I will reserve the bulk of my comments for the full city council meeting tomorrow . Thank you.,68,,
92,0.97,1342.074,1349.448,Councilmember Nelson?,69,,
93,0.97,1349.448,1360.859,"Thank you everyone . First, would like to thank my staff.",70,,
94,0.97,1360.859,1508.573,This is my speech . Jeremy moons Stephen Ellis and more have attained the patience and insight to prepare me for my very first budget . and I join the chorus of gratitude to our central staff for their professionalism and responsiveness especially director handy and Ian Gorman who I worked with most closely he basically had to hold my Han as a new person here . My topic budget priority was to create a Pathway for people experiencing homelessness and those living I temporary and supportive Housin to access comprehensive treatment . So thank you with your unanimous support we took that first step together . than you also for supporting accessibility at the AIDS Memorial Pathway . and proud that some key amendments that I passed did go forward including securing the operation with th ladder truck . particulate station 37 and the medic unit a fire station 26 both in West Seattle . and I think her Councilmember Herbal on securing the services . I do not sponsor very many budget proposals because we were Facin at that time an average annual operating deficit of 142 Millio to 2026. my perspective was spending within our means is no austerity it's just the only way that we achieve a sustainable budget . It is their job and we must carefully Prioritize our investments and track these outcomes . If they're not producing intended outcomes and results that we have to reevaluate and consider other potentially more Effectiv levels . that is our duty as accountable Stewart's . based on the top concerns are constituents of shared I Wante to see for things reflected in our budget decisions . a higher priority doing everything possible to support the ability to returned adequate staffing levels and bring in those lingering response times . to improve on her homelessness response because there is growing frustration that progress is too slow for the money we are spending.,70,,
95,0.97,1508.573,1530.028,Improvement may involve more accountability and oversight O our service providers . strong support for economic Developmen that directly benefit small businesses and their workers.,70,,
96,0.97,1530.028,1618.316,"Especially those of color to build generational wealth for themselves and their communities . and then finally a shared commitment to playing forward with existing resources instead of relying on finding additional resources and revenues to address our ongoing budget gap . As we do head into a recession the strength of our tax base is unpredictable . and the only thing we can control I our businesses . Mayor Harold sent down a strong Forward-Looking budget with new initiatives to improve public safety and homelessness . I appreciate Councilmember war as Lewis and Peterson for Amendin the balancing package to preserve his proposal to get parking enforcement back to SPD because that saves the city about $8 million . However, the budget REJECTS many of the item that would have improved quality of life and economic opportunity for the people Seattle . such as graffiti removal and technical Assistanc for women and minority owned businesses . a program to help small businesses export their products . and the Seattle job center a crucial workforce development and job placement initiative . and I don't see why that didn't make a priority.",70,,
97,0.97,1618.316,1635.567,Restricting the authority to us salary savings to pay for emergent needs like overtime and basic equipment training and permanently eliminating 80 positions in the Department?,70,,
98,0.97,1635.567,1696.361,That may be standard practice I normal times but with SPD down 30% of its deplorable force 35 higher than they were in 2020 these are not normal times . I just don't think that this is the time to do that again . We also just have to change that narrative to help get us Throug the staffing shortage . Instead of embracing me improved homelessness focus that the expansion of the unified care team would have brought this budget mostly continues to fund the same service providers without that accountability I was calling for and I think Tha that is a missed opportunity.,70,,
99,0.97,1696.361,1749.714,This moment in Seattle demands that we meet our greatest challenges with urgency humility and courage to try NE things and to do something different . There is room for improvement it's not time for the status quo . We have to demonstrate we are listening t our constituents and give them reason to believe that we are trying to change the direction of our city . that is what I Wa elected to do and that is what I've been trying to say in Thes meetings all along . This is simply not the budget I've been advocating for and I think it I out of sync with what most in Seattle want . I don't take this lightly but I will be voting no,70,,
100,0.97,1749.714,1802.066,I'm holding the majority of my comments until tomorrow . bu I do want to address some of the comments that we have heard from Council members this morning about public safety investments and changes to the Mayor's proposed budgets . I want to lift up some comments that I prepare for my Newslette last week . I feel they are appropriate for the comments that we are hearing today . I'm disappointed that in voting on today's budget people are unwilling to highlight the positive that we are doing.,71,,
101,0.97,1802.066,1866.03,This creates the false Narrativ and I think we need to change it . The very argument about changing the narrative is actually perpetuating the narrative . It is true that we have public safety issues in th city . crime is higher it's a fact that we have significantly fewer officers than before . It is a fact that not a single officer was laid off with the police reductions . It's normal to debate budget issues . Our local public safe D debate mirrors national politics as well . A fear of crime is understandable . victims of Crim are experiencing harm and communities are experiencing harm . But these false narrative don't make us safer.,71,,
102,0.97,1866.03,2016.581,Ultimately I feel that these are a contributing factor to the false narrative that so man people are talking about this morning wanting to change . Thi misinformation results the members of the public not understanding that counsel has fully funded SPD budget for hiring over the third year in row . This the third year in a row they fully funded SPD Hirin budget and I feel like this conversation that we are having will actually hurt retention and hiring . because we are not focusing on what is in the budget . and what supports public safety . Instead were talking about a very small reduction in the Mayor proposed budget . You can debate about public safety and any other issues that are vital with democracy . But you have to acknowledge the location in question of parking enforcement is actually resolved in this budget . So the discussions we are hearing this morning is not acknowledging that 99% of the Mayor's proposed budget is included in this balancing package . SPD hiring is fully funded and they've begun to show some promising trends and minor reductions to the remaining 1% of the budget are being emphasized and exaggerated . This is the harmful rhetoric that is Likel to continue to negatively Impac hiring and retention . I would like to reference a great editorial that King County's Haley recently wrote: public safety is about solving tough problems not scoring political points . This editorial emphasizes that in the context of restorative justice it's about a political strategy.,71,,
103,0.97,2016.581,2048.746,That Capitalizes on the public sphere while highlighting a public story and I feel Strongl that we need to tell the full story of our investments . for community safety and investments that improve people's day-to-day lives and will Ultimatey make our city safer . Thank you . please go ahead.,71,,
104,0.97,2048.746,2082.88,Before I share my support I think Councilmember Nelson and Councilmember Peterson . I thin one thing that I did learn and I still agree with him is that the majority of our counsel people who are closer to our constituents have concerns Abou public safety . As you know we did learn a lot we also Learne that you cannot overlay a major policy shift on a city that Wa not prepared or ready for it.,72,,
105,0.97,2082.88,2098.096,And I think now we are prepared and ready . I think that they are working to set up the community . the community Safet communications center . Okay.,72,,
106,0.97,2098.096,2134.098,Thank you . What I'm trying to say is that we are now poised t be ready to implement the social justice things that should happen . and that is the reason why 2020 was so Importan and what we have learned from it . We also learned in this budget that we have to be frank and candid to put the PEO back in SPD . I think that was a failed attempt to try to make people feel better that Someho social justice was happening an I don't think that this was it.,72,,
107,0.97,2134.098,2253.351,"And I want to go back to what the Councilmember said and I believe I've said this before when I voted . originally, I was concerned about the 200 positions and again I voted that we have SPD fill 120 of those positions . and 80 are permanently gone if use that word or Aggregated if you want to use that word . and that's where the narrative is where we can get into the Nuanced and Semantics of words . But there are 120 positions . As we told Councilmember Peterson and all the city of Seattle let's go back and see where we are with that and add more . based on th forecast revenue after the Mayor's budget they came to us and we have three competing narratives . So I want to share in my truth with what they mentioned . I cannot stress our budget share working with the Mayor's office . This budget cycle went forward with real and clear discussions the did not get personal . every year I always appreciate what the Councilmember brings to the table about expanding the Jumpstart and we will continue to work on that . But I love with the Councilmember Nelson had to say with the Charter responsibilities . and I don't think we fell short of that charter responsibility . for that reason I will be voting yes . Thank you.",72,,

135,0.97,2419.583,2427.158,Yes Council President the rules do need to be suspended because the meeting occurred after Thursday at 12:00 noon.,91,,
136,0.97,2427.158,2542.039,"Okay . Councilmember today's meeting occurred after Thursday's noon date from the previous week . given the Holida we did it take the last votes on Monday since this is now a week later we want to consider the set for counsel tomorrow I would like to suspend the rules to place the approved legislation on tomorrow's full city council agenda for the final vote . Council President thank you again for your partnership throughout this budget process . They've concurred to place this on the city council agenda for the 29th . If there is no objection it will be suspended . hearing no objection counsel is suspended . The select budget committee will send today's legislation to the November ninth site November 29th Seattle city council meeting fo final consideration . I will save most of my comments personally for tomorrow . But I will say this, I think in this climate right now with the context of what is going on across the country it is ever more important to be able to identify ways to work together to find common ground and cause and how we can achieve really challenging visual policy changes that have been demanded for decades . In this climate that we are experiencing so man people have food insecurity and housing in Securities and job Insecurities . worry about whether not they will be able t pay the bills next month . The last thing the city needs is people who are going to with up rhetoric and create more fear and concern what we have done in this budget is identify Ommon ways to invest in what our city needs right now.",92,,
137,0.97,2542.039,2542.873,Support for small businesses.,92,,
138,0.97,2542.873,2543.707,Support for housing stability.,92,,
139,0.97,2543.707,2591.422,We are doing over half $1 billion across this budget in investments for affordable housing that will create opportunities for family Elders youth students and more . so that they can stay stable he housed . were creating opportunities in partnership with the regional homelessness authority who has been charged with working across our County to work with trusted community providers and to get people inside in a way that is stabilizing them and builds trust with community organizations . and those individuals who need access to not just a roof and a door but health services throughout medication levels in excess CAS management . We do that by investing in community levels.,92,,
140,0.97,2591.422,2617.982,In public utilities and human services departments . and meet their needs in the long-term.,92,,
141,0.97,2619.55,2914.111,And the other four or five different departments is a way to make sure that we are creating solutions that is the word of it came from the deputy Mayor's mouth . No one is carrying anyone else's water carefully working in extremely tough times to put together this level preventing others from falling into homelessness and allowing people to come off of the street and get into care it make sure that every dollar goes into the green new deal investments and equitable development efforts . into an economic recovery and invests historic amounts . things in large part to Jumpstart . We ha to Realign every single item to make sure that we are following the spend plan staying true to what the spend plan commitments were and also showing flexibility in partnership with the Mayor's office in the city budget office to make sure that we do address this historic shortfall in revenue that is currently being projected for the next by annual budget . We are in uncertain times . But Wha is certain is that the budget Realigns our investments to take our community that is housed and cared for healthy an safe and an economy that invest in small businesses and workers so we can have a more resilient and equitable Seattle as we see to recover not only from the pandemic and the hardships on our health but the hardship it has also created on local economies . I hope that folks get the chance to look at every word in this budget again overnight . and reconsider supporting this proposed budget this is a foundation that will help for a greater and more equitable economy create Housin and stability for folks and it's been truly drafted by Stakeholders at the table year-round identifying the priorities that need to this process . but also throughout eight and nine weeks to make sure that we were following those who are most affected by injustices most impacted by inequity and putting them at th forefront of how we create the budget that can help to server most Formable communities . Jus this morning and Ke Ow was talking about increased need fo food assistance . We moved over one $.2 million to the Ministry to fund back to other funding that otherwise would've gone away thanks to Council members we actually put money into areas where we saw decreases or potential issues with food in Securities and emergency food sources and funding for food that is exactly what they Talke about this morning meeting the cultural need of folks . This is not a budget that was easily Crafted . There are not haircut across each Department that would've been an easy way to address $141 million deficits going into this budget . and then having to address in over $85 million reduction in revenue . two weeks before we were going to finalize our budget . What we did instead Wa a thoughtful approach to try to make sure that the most honorable are cared for . that the programs that create stability and security shelter and hope during these times had funding at the forefront . This is a budget that is clearly a challenge to craft in these times as you can hear from the differences of opinion amongst colleagues . This is not an Eas task to put together a budget that invests in our most vulnerable rebuild programs Tha face potential issues Especiall with the shortfall of Federal funding . and it can't do anything with the existing revenue that we currently have.,92,,
142,0.97,2914.111,2926.857,So I call for additional progressive revenue and look forward to Partnering with the Mayor's office and the task force charged with identifying progressive revenue streams to make sure that we don't end up in a situation like this again.,92,,
143,0.97,2926.857,2998.996,"But what is not obtainable is fulfilling every desire for new items . with the existing revenue and then also being criticized for not supporting those items with the existing revenue that we have and having to make very tough choices moving funding to food and housing . supporting our Cultura activities and ensuring there I opportunity for social engagement that so many people face isolation, depression anxiety and more . We are caring for the health of our community and our economy in this budget and I look forward to Continuin to do more as we have more progressive revenue streams in the future . I hope that we can have an honest conversation about what is actually here and not to dive into the divisive rhetoric that we see capturing our nation . Seattle is better than that . We've been able to lead the nation in so many ways on progressive policy revenue and more . people look at us to make sure that we are leading I this time as we seek to recover and include a more stable and resilient economy . I am proud O what we have been able to do.",92,,
144,0.97,2998.996,3007.838,I'm very proud of the partnership that we've tried to bridge with the Mayor's office.,92,,
145,0.97,3007.838,3027.724,This is a tough budget and we were able to find solutions on some challenging issues . We may not agree on everything but Tha is the purpose of the legislative and in branch . This is the ultimate branch that designs the budget . and in partnership with and with feedback of course from the Mayor's office directly from communities and Stakeholders.,92,,
146,0.97,3027.724,3060.957,Those who are living the injustices and hardships that have only been worsened by this pandemic . and proud to talk about this again tomorrow with the Mayor's office but I want t make sure we are having an honest conversation about what it took to craft this budget an the important foundation that this lays for an equitable economy and a healthier community . Let's turn to Councilmember Lewis now . and then I will say some closing comments just to thank folks fo helping us to get to this point today.,92,,
147,0.97,3060.957,3221.851,Thank you chairman . I'm get a save the balance of my remark for tomorrow . But your speech I now inspired me just to share a couple highlights as it pertain to homelessness and some of those decisions made around the homelessness policies . You know when I started my time on the Council we had no real regional approach to homelessness . We only had an idea and a concept about what the regional Homeles authority might be and it's bee up to us over the last two year in partnership with King count suburban jurisdictions and indeed with the provider and business communities to breathe life into that idea . This may be the first budget that truly embraces that new regional mode and commits to it . and it does so as United city with the enthusiastic support and blessing of the executive and Merrill authority . I'm compelled to speak up now because I don't want to give the impression the decisions that have been made on how to streamline unify and reduce redundancies in our outreach an provider networks is somehow adverse to the Herald administration . Indeed this is a new unified approach that was lobbied aggressively for the business community underlying their commitment for regional solution to homelessness . and this counsel listened . They listened and they did the hard work of coming up with the system that is going to move forward on a regional Commitmen and lean in for emerging best practices during Covid that Hav been working to resolve Instea of looking at the encampment locations . I want to say some of the alternatives that have been proposed in these deliberations would not have represented something new but indeed a tripling down on the things that we've done in the recent past that have not been working . and this was recognize by the old administration in those final negotiations Betwee Council members and myself and other leaders represented by we are in among other Stakeholder who wanted to move in a new direction of the regional homelessness authority is laying out as a path forward.,93,,
148,0.97,3221.851,3376.106,That does not mean that we will not still have disagreements or that things will still need to be ironed out . I've been very outspoken on issues where I have had disagreements with the strategic and leadership decisions made with the Regiona homelessness authority . But we always work them out and move forward together and the trend has been moving in a much more positive direction . I did have the great privilege to take a tour that I highly recommend Yo sit in on to be part of officer of emergency management center that they have set up . You Hav regional homelessness leaders getting together in conference treating all of the Hotspots they are working on taking people into some kind of enhanced shelter . You can see this new system beginning to turn in a way that it never ha before and a way that has a Buy-In with interest groups and governments . So I asked as we go into making decisions based on that final vote tomorrow t really deeply consider the constituencies we've been working closely with our requesting of this counsel in terms of the small businesses in the greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce with the service providers in the whole Coalitio has been demanding a much bigger investment and Suiting up within the regional response ends also consider that no one has been banging down our door to trickle down on the practice in the recent past which may have superficially look like were making progress but we are only exacerbating the underlying problems . So one lift of that work that we've done over the course of this budget process and indeed with the deputy Mayor's leadership harmonizing a new policy with mark Jones and I look forward to seeing this action over the course of the next year breathing life into this new Wa with national best practices.,93,,
149,0.97,3376.106,3492.288,And I will expand more on that but I wanted to get these remarks out given that this is an area involved throughout the course of the budget process and I wanted to make sure in case there are misconceptions O the statements made today . on how these things came together and what the implications of that will be . Thank you Madam chair and I'm looking forward t saying more tomorrow . Thank you very much . I think jointly in terms of finding that common ground I want to think some folks . First of all members of my team Aaron house and Melani Cray this is been a tough budget year and I've really been working around the clock t help to bring in Stakeholder ideas working with central staff and more someone to thin all the folks on my team for their incredible work . I also want to thank the President and vice chair as we have had the opportunity to work through no only the process with the Council president but also talking through the opportunities to really move some important policy ideas fo the betterment of the city in partnership with the Mayor's office .

They've noted the importance of the work of central staff tomorrow we will make sure to thank everyone again but this could not have come together without the heroic efforts of central staff to be able to identify opportunities for us to Realig funding sources and do a deep dive into how each proposed expense was being paid . and to ensure all of this before the November revenue came forward.,93,,
151,0.97,3577.74,3767.864,To specifically invest with th decline of 64 million across th real estate excise tax which I a huge funding source for capital improvement projects . W had to quickly identify ways to keep a certain project that was already in development on track and then to look with that equity lens as we continue to invest with pedestrian safety road traffic mitigation and slowing down efforts to ensure that we were improving with health and safety of our community . was not an easy charge so I want to thank everyone from central staff wit the leadership of director hand and deputy director Pucci and every single one of the central staff members .
