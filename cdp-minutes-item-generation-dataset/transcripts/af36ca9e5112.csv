26,0.97,270.003,292.425,"Public health King County has warned us anyone who is sick should stay home and everyone should limit their exposure to others, as you heard from the governor's press conference moments ago the recommendation is for those who limit travel and unnecessary interactions with other people.",11,,
27,0.97,292.425,308.675,"Others with Covid-19 as well as close contact should follow public health guidance and due to hour aptitude, confirming or calling in if you suspect that you have Covid-19 or worried about it.",11,,

29,0.97,320.887,332.699,"Social distancing public health reminds us is to make sure we stop the spread of the illness so we do not exceed the current capacity, people who need health care are able to access it.",11,,
30,0.97,332.699,350.183,People with Covid and those who have been exposed to Covid recently are apt to make sure that they share information with their medical provider about any concern they have about exposure.,11,,
31,0.97,350.183,352.452,This truly is a complex effort and shared responsibility.,11,,
32,0.97,352.452,375.141,"It is inspiring to see the ways our community has stepped up even at a distance, we thank public health for all they are doing and remind the county, individuals County wide so they can call if they have various concerns but really this call line is being Ideally used for people on the frontline staff, Emt's, medical provider, Firstresponders.",11,,
33,0.97,375.141,393.192,"If you do have questions call 206-477, encouraging folks to call their primary care provider if they have one, reach out to the primary health system if they do not have a primary provider and need assistance.",11,,

39,0.97,434.4,457.69,"However, the Department of health guidance, two health care providers directs them to focus testing on people who show Covid symptoms such as the fever, cough, shortness of breath, provides people for higher risk for Covid-19 while anyone can ask their provider, testing is provided at the provider's direction.",11,,
40,0.97,457.69,472.038,"Our local health Department does not oversee testing, they are working with key partners to coordinate testing for priority corporations like drive through events we have seen in the news, for most in our community, it is up to their health care provider if they will be tested.",11,,
41,0.97,472.038,478.211,I understand this is frustrating for many and public health wants to under score that they understand the frustration as well.,11,,
42,0.97,478.211,491.657,"But we must remember there is no unique treatment for Covid- 19, it is a new virus and our best response, according to public health Seattle King County to ensuring everyone's health is to implement community and strategy.",11,,
43,0.97,491.657,503.903,I want to thank public health and King County for ongoing partnership with the Mayor's office who we have on the line with our friends from King County and at the state level we know they are extremely busy.,11,,
44,0.97,503.903,516.983,"I did want to share that report with the council as King County is not able to join us, our colleague's preliminary office will begin momentarily.",11,,
45,0.97,516.983,537.503,"Before we begin with presentations, I want to acknowledge the Council has received two emergency orders from the Mayor, the first one was filed on March 11 and relates to Covid-19, small business relief, the second one relates to an emergency order filed today and relates to the moratorium on residential Eviction.",12,,

50,0.97,617.783,650.683,"The first bit of information I just want to, for table setting, is we just received, I think, this afternoon the latest information on cases in depth for King County, we have 488 confirmed Covid-19 cases 459 associated with the life center facility in Kirkland.",13,,
51,0.97,650.683,689.655,"And the council member with the latest rounds of public health orders we are currently in the state of temporary closure of bars, health clubs, movie theaters, nightclubs and other social and recreational establishment until March 31 also restaurants will be allowed to do drive through take out and delivery services only.",13,,

54,0.97,806.205,812.111,We're hoping to make significant progress on this in short order.,13,,
55,0.97,812.111,843.108,"Second is this afternoon we'll be announcing a new proposed food voucher program where we will also be seeking Council authority of $5 million to serve up to 6250 people, families two installments of $400 vouchers for critical need for food during this time of Covid-19 response.",13,,
56,0.97,843.108,871.237,"We have had an unbelievable response to our small business relief Fund, I think initially we received over 2,000 applicants for resources issuing an additional $1 million in resources that we will be looking to allocate for the small business relief fund to help businesses.",13,,
57,0.97,871.237,930.796,"So those three actions or sort of late breaking today that I want to make sure I gave the Council a heads up on, I wanted to focus my discussion on sort of the way we are structured around four I guess buckets of work response, we have been looking at this structure consistent with our Eoc response structure going forward, those include a particular emphasis around public safety and health and a team focused on community needs and operations and finally, a team that has emphasizing they work around human services which is primarily work around vulnerable populations and of course homelessness response.",13,,
58,0.97,930.796,935.034,I just want to talk to a couple of things in each of those buckets.,13,,
59,0.97,935.034,948.947,"I can either take questions along the way or we can do them at the end, we can go either way, council member Musgade I'll let you facilitate.",13,,
60,0.97,948.947,990.823,"Thank you, due to the large number of questions that were sent to you in advance, I'm going to ask if your team can go through your presentation in response to those questions, I want to thank you, we have around 2 pages worth of questions about a dozen or so different buckets of categories, let's let them walk through the presentation, I will pause if there is questions and we'll make sure to get questions answered before the presentation is over.",14,,
61,0.97,990.823,992.558,We have something.,15,,
62,0.97,992.558,1008.107,"I just, if possible I wanted to add a question, directly to the Mayor's office it is more a public health question, I thought it would be helpful to ask in because we're wrapping up discussion today.",15,,
63,0.97,1008.107,1034.6,"So the question I had and it was good for medical professional in public health to answer this, it is not clear to me, not clear to a lot of people, which is the question of social distancing and the testing aspect.",16,,
64,0.97,1034.6,1132.531,"I'm not clear by saying as collective or not, I just wanted to raise that there was very important article that was published in the Guardian, the article is in the UK Mayor, the prime minister Boris Johnson has taken what medical professionals believe are inadvisable on testing so it is not just about Seattle it is general question I have, is the medical professional in that article including a Pediatrician who was a former director in the world health organization, they are telling us absolutely social distancing is important and that testing the population is incredibly important and that we are my sense is, I just wanted to read a quote, the key principal from the world health organization, we test the population like crazy, find out whether cases are, quarantine them and get them out of the community, this is a family cluster under control, this is how some have dropped their numbers down, you can really take people out of the population and make sure they are quarantine, that is vital for social distancing.",16,,
65,0.97,1132.531,1166.064,"I feel like we need some gravity in terms of testing because it seems like everybody is being told social distancing but a lot of people are reaching out to us I'm sure as well, telling us that they have full insurance, not being tested and so it is understandable that our hospitals and clinics are over burdened because that is the nature of the nonprofit health care system, on the other hand, what we need of actually containing this crisis.",16,,
66,0.97,1166.064,1167.633,"Thank you, council member.",16,,
67,0.97,1167.633,1170.702,I appreciate that.,16,,
68,0.97,1170.702,1189.087,"I know we are Pausing I do believe you had a question that didn't get included, if you'd like to ask anything at this point, then we'll have the deputy Mayor continue with the presentation, we'll just take a moment to see if you had one more question that didn't get added.",16,,
69,0.97,1189.087,1192.024,"Thank you, council member.",17,,
70,0.97,1192.024,1192.291,Vasceda.,17,,
71,0.97,1192.291,1214.313,"It was focused on the hospital capacity, and also what we're doing with our first responders, especially with the firefighters on the Frontlines dealing with this crisis, the main question was about hospital capacity and are we going to be overwhelmed, what are we doing about that.",17,,
72,0.97,1214.313,1225.257,"Thank you for colleagues, I'm going to turn it back over to the Mayor's office to see the numbers that we have to ask and the two we just asked a moment ago.",17,,
73,0.97,1225.257,1253.418,"Thank you, council member Esceda, I will do my best, I do have the questions and I will, as I work our way through are four areas of focus, we'll try to address as many as possible, some of which we may follow up with additional detail after this discussion given some of the more elements associated with them.",18,,
74,0.97,1253.418,1267.032,I'll just start with public safety and public health group of efforts.,18,,
75,0.97,1267.032,1358.423,"We are obviously extremely interested in some of the public health efforts and the ongoing capacity around testing, obviously I can't answer the bulk of the questions related to the guidance the council member requested, we can certainly follow up with public health and bring more clarity to that discussion . We recently received the authorization from the Department of health, with our first responders to do testing of our own first Responder personnel first responders from the Seattle police Department, Seattle fire Department, to be able to carry out testing directly and then for our test to be then shift to, I believe, the University of Washington for results, so I know this has been a particular concern and interest of the Mayor, as well as the Council to make sure that those on the frontline are able to get tested when they have been potentially exposed to Covid-19 cases presented in our community.",18,,
76,0.97,1358.423,1431.43,"So that is underway I also know from your line of inquiry there were several questions related to the criminal justice system the King County Jail and court, I'll speak to those real briefly from my notes here, there was questions related to in terms of what the courts and jails and detention centers are doing to prevent the spread of Covid-19, we received some responses from King County that they have procedures in place after the King County jail for when those folks are showing symptoms are presumed to be potentially contagious, they'll isolate those individuals in the infirmary, necessary cleaning and other procedures in order to mitigate the spread of the virus with the detention center.",18,,
77,0.97,1431.43,1464.229,"I believe they are doing a few other precautionary measures as it relates to Visitation and minimizing population in the jail itself, programming, productions and other population reduction measures such as no longer accepting Doc inmates, other strategies intended to minimize the number of individuals Congregating in the detention center, itself.",19,,
78,0.97,1464.229,1520.151,"Then, of course, there has been new information related to Seattle municipal court, they'll be closed for a facility cleaning for the next couple of days as they have had Covid-19 case present within the courthouse and then of course all of these closures of the community court facility as well as their limited operations that will begin on March 23 last until April 12, these closures will not Procedurally have statutory requirements as it relates to proceedings and cases that will be underway.",19,,
79,0.97,1520.151,1535.834,There will be some limited operations set up in order to address some of the case load and we can come back you with more detail specificity how those will be conducted.,19,,
80,0.97,1535.834,1579.878,"There's been some question about parking enforcement, 72 hour notification, we are still examining some of the Enforcements particularly related to that body of work, what I can say today at this point is we are not Enno, enforcing, that will not be happening right at this time, that we'll take a closer look at parking enforcement in general over the next couple of days potentially have new guidance to share with you all in short order.",20,,
81,0.97,1579.878,1667.432,"I know there's been some questions about coordination with our hospitals and this actually touches a little bit on Council member Peterson's question, the county is actively engaged with our partnership as well as the States and the Northwest health care network to ensure that contingency plans are in place as it relates to hospital bed capacity I think we have seen the past region wide, roughly 4900 or 4,000 to the state and county and health care network are looking at contingency planning to span that Capacit and those can be other medical facilities in the region that can take more patients and then beyond that, we then move in to what I'll refer to as sort of the sort of sheltering strategy that start to look at triage operations in order to take more patients if necessary.",20,,
82,0.97,1667.432,1683.114,"That, of course, extends to efforts around isolation and quarantine as well, that coordination is happening at the county level and that the city efforts are intended to help supplement those to the extend possible.",20,,
83,0.97,1683.114,1739.27,I think the goal now is to stand up as many backed up facility and options as possible with various purposes for these facilities I don't have the list in front of me of those implemented today as they identify both locations in the city and locations across King County we can come back with more information from our human services folks at a later date were there any public safety or Health-Related issues if there are other questions or folks would like to bring up at this point which is a Recap of contingency operations that were instituted last week.,20,,
84,0.97,1739.27,1753.918,"Just a quick question, will you, do you have more in your presentation really for services and protocol for the homeless population is that already included in health and safety?",21,,
85,0.97,1753.918,1756.788,Sorry for the Kiddos in the background.,21,,
86,0.97,1756.788,1757.055,Yeah.,22,,
87,0.97,1757.055,1848.146,"I was going to circle back to homelessness when I got back to human services work navigation team and sheltering in reference to the Guardian article, I have seen that there is guidance out of for the world health organization when there is an individual in the home who tested positive that other residence in the home should not practice social distancing, social isolation and should also stay in the home and I'm wondering, do we know if public health is considering guidance like that or do they need to issue guidance, can they effectuate that without specific guidance.",22,,
88,0.97,1848.146,1893.591,"I will say when it comes to our first responders, we have recognized that there are circumstances for which if someone had been exposed to Covid-19 there may be challenges for them to be able to return home and be able to execute isolation or quarantine strategy in which case we have tried to stand up alternative Optionsspecifically for fire and police personnel under those circumstances so if they have nowhere to actually isolate from.",23,,
89,0.97,1893.591,1913.511,"As far as the general guidance is concerned, I would have to defer to the public health in terms of how and if they would clarify and communicate that more broadly in terms of this guidance that you're talking about.",23,,
90,0.97,1913.511,1924.188,"I can't speak to that specifically, but I can say that we're trying to accommodate our first responders and find ourselves in that situation.",23,,
91,0.97,1924.188,1932.397,We have one more question from the council member to public health.,24,,
92,0.97,1932.397,1942.807,You may be on mute.,25,,
93,0.97,1945.109,2024.088,"With everything being discussed in terms of testing if we could get some sort of report on how the first Responder, the emergency technicians, nurses what kind of regimen do we have to get them tested on a regular basis, for those exposed, also Secondly, what kind of protective gear do they have access to and what kind of funds are being made available that they are what's recommended to international standards because I just very quickly a registered nurse, we're seeing this on social media also, medical professionals are reporting that they don't have enough protector suits or safety precaution, we want to find out initially the situation was very bad and the life care staff for a whole week, which I think is a pretty dangerous situation to be in.",26,,
94,0.97,2024.088,2027.658,"All right thank you, council member.",27,,
95,0.97,2027.658,2089.187,"The piece that I can address is we certainly are also concerned and I know the Mayor and many others regard to the availability and supply of personal protective equipment as it relates to Covid 19 response equipment and materials so those efforts are pushed up to the highest levels of our government including Federal administration to make sure we get folks what they need across the region, this is a high priority, in that top of mind to make sure that equipment is distributed as long as possible.",27,,
96,0.97,2089.187,2141.806,"For our benefits, colleagues I want to let you know we also had a conversation with public health director Patty Hayes and I think the questions, my suggestion to her yesterday was that we have her come for our Regularly-Scheduled Monday morning briefing before Relooking to Institute by phone if possible have public health come and be at the morning table so that the presentation can take place during that time frame, we're working on confirming that and make sure you summarize questions not specific to public health and many more attending at the state level and national level, just want to make sure you are aware of that, too, we are acting essential public health that they can come for that briefing as well.",28,,
97,0.97,2141.806,2172.603,"I'll just really quickly Recap city operations as much as this you already heard but Recap for the public, I will touch on human services and community needs and move the conversation along, operations just a reminder we have several closures in effect related to programming and community centers, libraries those will be through April 13th.",29,,
98,0.97,2172.603,2213.911,"We have an across the board suspension of events on city ground facilities right away also for 13, we have closures of our In-Person customer service counter for the time being in effect for the next week while we look and evaluate one of those operations could potentially be reopen on a professional basis, while at the same time we are maintaining Online access across the board for much of those customer counter services.",29,,
99,0.97,2213.911,2279.944,"As far as for our personnel right now, our current office, city hall, the tower when they open, all though given the closure of most of the In- person customer service facing operation if the staff for which we need to continue to sort of minimize Congregating the public physically coming in to city facilities so we'll be looking at those issues more closely as the week unfolds and we have been aggressively advancing encouragement and Pella work and work arrangements and I don't have the numbers in front of me but I can, we can share some of the details with regard to where we're at with work force strength if you will, when it comes to both folks there Tele- working and still working on site.",29,,
100,0.97,2279.944,2305.603,"Any questions on city operations I'm just going through the list here, I didn't see anything in particular that I am missing and questions that were accepted in operations but I could have missed something.",29,,
101,0.97,2305.603,2306.537,Okay.,30,,
102,0.97,2306.537,2387.084,"I'll move onto human services and the focus here has been primarily on shelter and homelessness population but also a fair amount of interested questions related to food programs and nutrition, et cetera, and hygiene and I guess I'll start, I have an update from the deputy Mayor and the director Johnson that we are in the process and this question came up last week when we talked about hygiene services we're in the process of leasing a few hygiene trailers that both include toilets and hand washing and may also offer some showering capability, the idea is to deploy the, across the city with hygiene trailers potentially staffed by Fpu or FAS, we are still working out some of the details but hoping to make a limited deployment if they start happening for perhaps even beginning later this week.",30,,
103,0.97,2387.084,2409.774,"I will get additional information from director Johnson to share with you all in writing with regard to the particulars but my understanding is that work is underway, I know that Council had been eager to see proposals for the space so we'll get that information to you.",30,,
104,0.97,2409.774,2411.041,Thank you.,31,,
105,0.97,2411.041,2493.19,"On the shelter work we are continuing to coordinate these efforts with King County but our primary objective at the moment is still focused on taking our existing shelter capacity and essentially Ãšintensify the number the shelters in order to be able to and of course reducing the number of people in those shelters in general so we have Laurel, help me out here, exhibition hall has been open for that purpose, we continue to look at some other alternatives as well at the moment, I know the county is securing several facilities with last several days across the region, again, we are looking at this space comprehensively in the context of mass sheltering not just for the homeless population, but also as contingency planning for hospital over capacity as well as for individual isolation and quarantine purposes.",32,,
106,0.97,2493.19,2524.255,"This is a space that now with the President's Declaration of emergency allows us to also tap FEMA resources with this regard, hoping over the next week or so we'll have more to say over approach of additional capacity, not just for homeless population, but also for general population as the needs potentially grow.",32,,
107,0.97,2524.255,2529.727,That's the latest on the capacity and shelter piece.,32,,
108,0.97,2529.727,2532.596,"On food, I think there are a couple --",32,,
109,0.97,2532.596,2584.114,"I just want to pause real quick here, I'm jumping on a question before moving onto assistance, I'm concerned about the reports that we are hearing about navigation, such as moving folks out of existing places that are frankly not in the public right of way, individuals who might be in parks, off to the shoulder of right of ways and not obstructing pedestrian walk ways, et cetera, especially concerned given that we know we're at capacity and our current shelters are trying to have what we have for greater social distancing can you talk about what the actual process for the navigation team and are people being asked to move as we stand reported Online?",33,,
110,0.97,2584.114,2613.31,"Council member, my understanding I'll just share what I have the navigation team is not currently performing any 72-Hour clean UPS, except where there is a danger to the occupants themselves and right now the focus frankly by the team is really on outreach and distribution of hygiene supplies and materials.",34,,
111,0.97,2613.31,2664.628,"So that is the guidance from the executive and that is our understanding what the focus of the team is, we'll be looking at and working with Fpu and parts of navigation team itself to look at potential, additional crash collection around Encampments but the current guidance is for the team to focus on outreach and engagement not clean up and removal, we're attracting Assessability issues with regards to pedestrian rights of way, when there is an obstruction situation only but in general we are not doing 72 hour clean UPS at this time.",34,,
112,0.97,2664.628,2665.929,Thank you for that.,35,,
113,0.97,2665.929,2681.979,"If there is concern for the public, do you have suggestions where we should direct them people are being without option for shelter.",35,,
114,0.97,2681.979,2703.834,"At this point I would suggest if we hear of those instances that have those directives to director Johnson and we will and that is oversight deputy Mayor, if you Overhear or see of instances where we need to look into, just let us know.",36,,
115,0.97,2703.834,2710.874,"Thank you very much, city Mayor, I know we have one more, did your question get answered?",37,,
116,0.97,2710.874,2712.81,Did you have a question?,37,,
117,0.97,2712.81,2774.538,"I have two questions but they are both related to, if I'm talking to them, in your representation you didn't address any you were thinking about on an intermediate basis, also specifically, I know we've been fighting for the dining house to be kept open, to have it permanently reestablished beyond March 31, I'm not sure what indication, I know the Mayor's office has given an indication, share that with us, Alsowe answer another year long permit and I'm not able to understand why this wouldn't be done as a matter of given the pandemic we are in.",38,,
118,0.97,2774.538,2828.358,"I think the easiest and least harmful thing to do to relieve, for those who have access to dining houses right now, let them know they are not going to have to move for another year, that they can have that security and on your point about I will give you there are some Recordigs that just happened recently, where the property of the homeless individual was damage if my memory serves me directly, I feel like you have to pay more attention to them.",38,,
119,0.97,2828.358,2847.578,"Before you respond, have a question, folks, I know the team had to jump off at 3:00, we have a quick follow up and you can answer those and get to the last second and you will let the office go with more information coming hopefully for Council briefings next week by follow up in writing.",38,,
120,0.97,2847.578,2851.815,Did you have a quick follow up before we turn it back?,38,,
121,0.97,2851.815,2951.782,"Ejust want to provide the follow up question, so we know that they are out there doing an assessment specifically focus on people in an encamp an, and questions about shedding light on potential vulnerability of people within the encampment, we know that since the beginning the team is across the city, distributed 430 health professional fliers and 53 hygiene tips, that sort of assessment work is really critical in how we want navigation, need for physical location to be cleaned up in helping people do that clean up I was told there was going to be discussion about essential removal of Encampments you said there are no 72 Removals but we know the vast majority of the outbreaks the vast majority were obstruction removal.",39,,
122,0.97,2951.782,2990.187,"I'm looking to receive follow up to the commitment that was made to me last week, further defining those obstruction Removals to make sure that we are not removing people and creating greater public health threat in removing Non- essential for removal location from you that that is a conversation that is going and we should expect to hear more from Hsd soon.",39,,
123,0.97,2990.187,3033.53,"Council member Herbal thank you for that, I'm looking at my notes here, I would concur that my understanding is also that they were refining the approach as it relates to the movement of activity left, significantly impair those with public health hazard for the general public continued they provide that to the Council.",40,,
124,0.97,3033.53,3083.947,"We are going to be looking at all options, extending capacity for sheltered individuals as we mentioned before I do think we have few sites specifically at tiny home expansion on Cherry Hill so they are looking at tiny home expansion with regard to North Lake we have communicated with the residence there that we are looking at an extension respond more to come.",41,,

126,0.97,3111.441,3207.137,"On child care we are working on a number of strategies, first and foremost is we're looking to Seattle public schools to provide a plan that would have some fashion of existing schools, in order to carry out child care services obviously with an abundance of caution as it relates to public health guidance associated with the capacity, limitations to spill practice, social distancing at the same time we've began working with our hospitals to ensure that we are working with them to identify child care for their medical personnel with children's hospital on some strategy that potentially may access some of our facilities, staff by their personnel, until provide health care for some of of their employees and working to create a more centralized, tracking health care, child care needs and I do know from the county side they are standing up some operations specifically on the Northwest health care network that we are doing it hospital by hospital.",42,,
127,0.97,3207.137,3254.985,"At the same time strategically within our team, we're beginning to look at potentially but don't necessarily rely on the 10, 15, 20 children, child care setting Classroom-Type arrangements relying perhaps more heavily on family and neighbor care under the current circumstances and looking at how we can help facilitate a pool of resources and individuals that may be able to provide that kind of service for folks in our communities including health care workers but also first responders and others that may need child care.",42,,
128,0.97,3254.985,3262.592,"This is an active space that we're still working on, hoping to have more specific strategy this week.",42,,

231,0.97,4145.14,4227.189,"The conversations resolve around the fact that there are schools and early learning facilities child care centers, that sometimes end up closing due to public safety or public health concerns and those closures are not mandated but a public official as we see on the legislation in front of you, our attempt here is to try to address that concern by requiring a closure of school or early learning facility, day care center to be closed at the mandate of a public official if a child care facility or a place where a dependent goes if closed we thought it was really Impairtive if workers who have their widows there are able to access sick days, this is critical for out of an abundance of caution, even when asked at the Federal level President Trump was asked whether or not this means day cares are supposed to close and they had no good answer, basically said we'll need to get back to you, in the meantime, many of our child care providers, small schools are closing out of an abundance of precaution without an official mandating it we want to make sure parents can advocate safely.",88,,
232,0.97,4227.189,4244.84,"Also how this can be considered in the context of closures for deep cleaning, teacher In- services, snow closure, issued broader than Coronavirus, this is sick and paid days when the school is closing out of both safety issues as well.",88,,
233,0.97,4244.84,4255.15,"This allows for parents to be able to put food on the table and not losing a day's wage when their dependence, place of care is closing.",88,,
234,0.97,4255.15,4289.051,"I understand we're doing as much as we can to help with more businesses, make sure there is more wages for individuals losing their job, health care and Accessing information I think it is complementary to make sure there is peace of mind for parents this is one small piece of the puzzle to make sure workers can access paid and sick leave if a school closure, early place of care if an entity closing without a public official directive than there is no question the parents can access that care.",88,,
235,0.97,4289.051,4307.269,"With us from essential staff I believe there is amendments to come to this bill, before we get in to the potential amendments I want to see if there is any questions from our colleagues about the underlying legislation in front of you?",88,,
236,0.97,4307.269,4307.469,Okay.,88,,
237,0.97,4307.469,4319.014,"Hearing none, thank you for getting on the line with us, if you could stay on the line if there is additional questions about the amendments that would be very helpful.",88,,
238,0.97,4319.014,4340.769,"Council colleagues if there is the council member has an amendment I would love for her to address, would you like to address your amendment?",88,,
239,0.97,4342.705,4355.15,"Council bill 119754 is presented on amendment 2, if I have a second I can describe it just go ahead.",89,,
240,0.97,4355.15,4401.196,"So what this amendment would do is it would fill some gaps that exist, similarly to the description from Council President Protem Maskeda, on a situation where workers can access paid sick time when a public official has closed a business, this also would fill a gap in those instances when a business has closed for health or Safety-Related reasons, that closure has not occurred at the behest of a public official.",89,,
241,0.97,4401.196,4475.704,"So whereas governor Inslee's order from today will cover employees restaurant bars retail order under existing paid sick leave laws will be able to access paid sick leave, but existing paid sick leave does not cover discretionary closures that businesses may decide independently of may not cover operations but not full business closures, this amendment is an attempt to fill that gap but also recognizing the impacts to medium and small businesses for potentially having to pay 100% of their sick and safe leave time if they do see a need themselves for closure.",89,,
242,0.97,4475.704,4494.523,"I'm trying to balance what I think is a fair approach to allow workers to access a bank that they already have, also recognizing impacts to small and moderate businesses.",89,,
243,0.97,4494.523,4521.149,"Another gap this amendment would fill is under current employment security Department rules employees must wait for one week for a stand by claim, employees under this amendment could use paid safe time while waiting for employment, unemployment insurance benefits for temporary lay offs.",89,,
244,0.97,4521.149,4544.106,And then finally there is the Federal legislation that identifies qualifying needs this amendment would allow employees to use paid safe time for qualifying needs that are not currently covered under the proposed Federal bill Hr6201.,89,,

387,0.97,5887.848,5930.024,So we heard from the Mayor's office that in providing this language we inadvertently modify the order in such a way that would this Incentivize landlords from accepting payment plans because we removed language that prohibited--we want to make sure we allow tenants and landlords to work out payment plans including partial payments and do not want to create a disincentive in order to do so.,164,,

399,0.97,6028.789,6059.052,"I just want to understand the process, if we vote yes to all for amendments, the commercial 30 to 60 days, all Evictions, not to enforce the law, are requesting, so if we voted yes to all of that, then we are not going to go into executive session about what the legal ramifications are, or are we just not going to do that?",168,,
400,0.97,6059.052,6095.389,"That is a good question, I think that if we have a policy answer I know there is another entity that has done a similar effort to instruct their sheriff's office in a similar manner, if there is a legal question, let me double back and take a look at that question but I think policy wise, Allie, do you have any examples of--but we also have the alternative of taking each amendment that has been suggested, I thought this would be a cleaner way to do it, though.",169,,
401,0.97,6095.389,6110.204,"Will you correct me if I am wrong, in one of the issues, was the language not request the sheriff not to enforce, is that the verb used?",170,,
402,0.97,6110.204,6126.086,"The language related to the sheriff is in section 1D of exhibit B on page 3, and it reads effective immediately the sheriff of King County is requested to cease execution of Eviction orders during the moratorium period.",171,,

404,0.97,6140.501,6218.278,"Councilmember Herbold's amendment would add a notice of termination to that modified order, so it is one action you would be taking to first, you would ask act on Councilmember Herbold's amendment to decide if you wanted to add that language in addition to the other modifications that were already added in exhibit B and then you would be taking on the resolution that modified the executive order with a combination of all of the changes I described Deviously so that includes expanding it tendencies, extending it to a 60 day moratorium rather than 30 days, applying it to most Eviction situations other than those that result when the attendant is posting posing a health or safety risk, and it would make it clear that it is a defense in Eviction action if the Eviction were to occur during the moratorium even if the tenant has not appeared in court, so it is one action, they could be taken up separately but I think there is some advice on how to manage that.",171,,

422,0.97,6350.31,6361.855,The language as outlined by Councilmember Herbold is now included in the underlying substitute that is before us for consideration.,177,,
423,0.97,6361.855,6400.894,"Resolution 31938,--did you have any other information to share with us on the document that will be circulated to the Council this morning policy questions as you know have come up especially it sounds like around Eviction process for partnership and--to the King County sheriff's office I am sure that there will be other questions as well do you mind summarizing for us the contents of the substitute in front of us?",177,,
424,0.97,6400.894,6460.954,"Specifically related to the change requesting that the King County--I have not identified other cities that have had this specific piece in their moratorium, but I have also not Researched that question in detail specifically what I can say is when I was working with the Council on the bill that introduced a defense to Eviction during winter months I found several examples of sheriff's office that either as a business practice or as the direction of the county or the cord that cease operation of enforcing Eviction orders during certain weather conditions and that sort of thing so this is along those lines which would be just if there are sort of Evictions in the process now that they not enforce during this moratorium but as Councilmember Juarez noted it is requested.",178,,
425,0.97,6460.954,6516.109,"The changes in what was the original order by the Mayor and in the modification to that order, would provide a lot of relief because it would prohibit most Evictions from occurring during this moratorium and as I noted the moratorium also passed for future actions to increase rental assistance funds and that sort of thing so that it, the intent here is that tenants continue to pay their rent and if they are unable to, then ask that the city, state, and county find additional resources . It is intended to just keep them housed and minimize the risk of exposure of the virus.",178,,
426,0.97,6516.109,6526.019,"The other changes I have walked through at a high level as you mentioned, this would also include commercial Evictions so that would not move forward under this moratorium.",178,,
427,0.97,6526.019,6549.409,"As well as all types of Evictions so the Mayor's orders were specific for Evictions due to nonpayment of rent, this would expand it to other causes of an Eviction to make sure that people remain Stably housed during this crisis.",178,,
428,0.97,6549.409,6551.845,Thank you.,179,,
429,0.97,6551.845,6560.153,I know that this is a really welcome ornaments from the Mayor.,179,,
430,0.97,6560.153,6573.066,We know that it response to what we are hearing from residential constituents across the city who are concerned about potentially being evicted in this period.,179,,
431,0.97,6573.066,6588.381,The concept that I was aiming for in the amended that I am supporting and the underlying substitute in front of you was also to make sure that this level of relief is offered to commercial tenants across the city.,179,,
432,0.97,6588.381,6601.595,I have received a number of calls and questions from small business owners about how the new directive at the state level is going to affect the smallest businesses that we have who are very concerned about paying rent.,179,,
433,0.97,6601.595,6617.21,I think there is--for all options given that--means that a lot of people are looking for some answers.,179,,
434,0.97,6617.21,6629.022,I also appreciate Allie's clarification that this makes sure that it is not directing an entity we do not have direction over but recommending or encouraging with the language that we use.,179,,
435,0.97,6629.022,6647.04,I think the stabilization strategy we are talking about here is to make sure we can get through this crisis and that public health remains the item that it is at the forefront.,179,,
436,0.97,6647.04,6658.051,-- I am supported of supportive of the amendments that are included in the underlying substitute in front of us.,179,,
437,0.97,6658.051,6726.92,"And I also recognize that at the end of this moratorium period, we may have to consider additional strategies, if there is a public health breakthrough and it comes before the end of this moratorium I know we will be back to the tables to talk about cleaning up this mess .--making sure that we are exempting--and that I think we have--I think that there is one additional piece to the puzzle and a good example of the community coming together to minimize the impact and protect each other.",179,,
438,0.97,6726.92,6737.03,"Before we open it up to additional questions, Councilmember Morales, I have not heard you speak to this.",179,,

440,0.97,6744.003,6749.309,I do not have anything to add to Allie's description.,180,,
441,0.97,6749.309,6775.068,"-- was to make sure that we are protecting folks against an economic impact and the risk exposure if they were to be evicted because of a noise ordinance or having their Stroller in the lobby, so we want to make sure that this extends protection to folks regardless of the situation.",180,,
442,0.97,6775.068,6820.78,"But the other point that I wanted to make particularly as it relates to protecting small businesses as well is that we know that small businesses are the lifeblood of our neighborhood commercial district, they employ many people, they provide support for families, and so I think as we move forward through this crisis, anything that we are considering doing to protect tenants, we also need to be incorporating protections for our small businesses particularly our Mom-And-Pop shops as we are speaking about any sort of assistance, rental protection, worker protections, make sure that we are considering them as well.",180,,
443,0.97,6820.78,6825.018,Thank you.,181,,
444,0.97,6825.018,6834.794,I also want to express my appreciation working with you.,182,,
445,0.97,6834.794,6857.25,"On the amendment, the broader amendment to this resolution, I want to express my appreciation to the Mayor's office, having worked today that they will be bringing us a subsequent emergency order related to commercial Evictions and I really look forward to working with them more on that.",182,,
446,0.97,6857.25,6896.756,"And I also wanted to speak to the fact that some of the language that we have included as it relates to residential Tenancies is in recognition that many landlords are requesting the court's to not issue writ in the face of this crisis, and I think that that is really helpful proof that many of us are really working hard to make sure that we are all rowing in the same direction here.",182,,
447,0.97,6896.756,6900.393,In this crisis.,182,,
448,0.97,6900.393,6968.628,"And in particular I think it is really important for landlords to be able to access emergency rent assistance, and so the rental housing Association has requested less of a focus on prohibiting their ability to issue notices and more of a focus on allowing the court to not issue writ and allowing the sheriff's office to not issue writ and that is why they are requesting the sheriff's office in there, I spoke to the sheriff today and they are looking at this issue but Finally, I think it is really also important to recognize that when folks do not show up in an Eviction court they often get the vote judgment, so that is why I think it is really important that we think broadly about this moratorium and I appreciate all the work that you have been doing to turn this around quickly.",182,,
449,0.97,6968.628,6979.772,"Thank you, counsel colleagues, questions.",183,,
450,0.97,6979.772,7007.667,"Just for the benefit of the public to take a step back here, the Mayor has issued another emergency order, which she is allowed to do and she is focusing on residential Evictions, we have a resolution that encourages her to look more broadly in subsequent orders, including looking at relief for commercial tenants, which I fully support.",184,,
451,0.97,7007.667,7055.348,"In addition, we have an amendment to the Mayor's executive order, which is exhibit B of our resolution, and that amendment goes well beyond what the Mayor's order is stating currently, so I am just trying to understand what our authority is to expand a Mayor's executive order in this situation, and since we have heard the deputy Mayor say commercial rent relief is coming this week and they have been working with the city attorney's office I wonder if it makes sense for us to collaborate with them and their efforts that are already underway.",184,,
452,0.97,7055.348,7060.052,Great question.,185,,
453,0.97,7060.052,7069.362,Councilmember Herbold I believe you said you are in touch with the Mayor's office--related to commercial tenants as well?,185,,
454,0.97,7069.362,7121.781,"I only learned through--central staff that the Mayor's office was working on another executive order we heard senior Ãšdeputy Mayor Fong reference that today in his remarks so I assume what that means is that we will have another executive order related to Evictions for commercial tenants before us at a later date and that will give us because again for each of those executive orders we have the ability to approve, modify, or reject, we will have an opportunity to further Fine- tune that next executive order when it comes.",186,,
455,0.97,7121.781,7123.549,I have a follow-up.,187,,
456,0.97,7123.549,7166.859,"Councilmember Lewis on the line here, to jumping really briefly, I do not know if we have anyone from the city attorney's office on the line currently but I certainly have some questions similar to what Councilmember Pedersen raised around the legal effect of altering an order significantly, so if we do have any city attorney folks on the line who could do an executive session on the impact these changes would have I would be interested in exploring before making a final decision on that.",188,,
457,0.97,7166.859,7168.528,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,189,,
458,0.97,7168.528,7175.635,I will see what other comments there are and your request is duly noted I will make sure to circle back to that I think Councilmember Pedersen had a follow-up as well.,189,,
459,0.97,7175.635,7212.405,"I know a lot of us have been hearing from small businesses and want to provide relief for the rental payments that they are on if they are on a--they are at risk of displacement and there is a lot of common ground I think with this counsel on this which is why this amendment is being proposed and so I just want to understand the amendment a little bit more, does this apply, is it specifically for small businesses or would large corporations who are renting their space also benefit from this?",190,,
460,0.97,7212.405,7221.414,I can respond to that question if that is okay.,191,,
461,0.97,7221.414,7231.29,The order as drafted would apply to any Eviction related to a commercial tenancy.,191,,
462,0.97,7231.29,7238.197,It is not specific to size of business.,191,,
463,0.97,7238.197,7273.733,"I will note that there may be action the Council can take at a later date to rescind this order or make different actions, take different actions in an emergency, ordinance that I can research more in concert with the law Department, but I do not have a definitive answer on what--I think there is a way to rescind this in the future and take a different action Legislatively if needed.",191,,
464,0.97,7273.733,7286.245,"I am just thinking something seeking something that is sustainable, so I echo Councilmember Lewis's comments earlier.",192,,
465,0.97,7286.245,7292.184,I believe Councilmember Sawant had a comment or question question mark,193,,
466,0.97,7292.184,7303.996,"I just wanted to make some comments on the overall legislation but I think that there are some other issues that have come up, maybe I can wait until later.",194,,
467,0.97,7303.996,7309.902,"Please go ahead, that would be helpful I think for context.",195,,
468,0.97,7309.902,7381.974,"Just on the question that Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Pedersen were referring to, I think it would be good to clarify what the process would be for the Council to amend the executive order, I want to make sure that we are on the right track, but I want to make some general comments on the overall question of the Eviction moratorium as a whole,--and I wanted to use the opportunity to thank the thousands of Renters and working people who have all participated despite the restrictions on any political gathering sue through social media and encouraging the--it remains an important issue for working people.",196,,
469,0.97,7381.974,7392.952,"More and more we are hearing that workers are having reduced or completely eliminated paychecks, they are having layoff notices.",196,,
470,0.97,7392.952,7420.579,"-- I think this is absolutely remarkable, and this was in addition to the important public letter that was sent out by a lot of groups together including--and also other actions as well which are hopefully forthcoming.",196,,
471,0.97,7420.579,7462.555,"I think the Mayor's executive order is a demonstration of the kind of power we can have with grassroots organizing and--and in terms of the question Councilmember Pedersen brought up--I really feel that it is important because the absolutely widespread extent to which small businesses have been impacted, it is unimaginable really.",196,,
472,0.97,7462.555,7607.066,"I do not know that any realistic amount that can be set aside will be enough, so I think that an Eviction moratorium is--it is a big victory for working people and struggling small businesses, we encourage people who are listening in to continue to fight for--hopefully going forward, one is we do need a moratorium on foreclosures, and also while it is important to provide this Eviction protection for 60 days--obviously no money to get caught up on rent in normal circumstances 60% of Americans do not have the ability to face a $1000 unexpected expense, so we need--we need a mandate on landlords utilities and--to work out payment plans that will allow tenants and homeowners who are suffering economically up to 24 months to fulfill their payment obligations and we will continue organizing and--I also agree strongly with Councilmember Herbold that--the courts need to stop holding Evictions that--that almost exclusively targets the most vulnerable people at such a time during a pandemic it is just unimaginable, and I want to congratulate all the activists who did this and I also wanted to use the opportunity in closing to mention the very important proposal and accompanying position petition that my office has launched alongside Councilmember Morales's office to expedite a vote by the city Council to tax Amazon and other big businesses to provide emergency Covid-19 relief including cash assistance for working families that are going to have lost income.",196,,
473,0.97,7607.066,7615.207,I just wanted to share that within less than 24 hours we have nearly 2000 signatures in the petition.,196,,

507,0.97,7922.047,7922.848,"You, thank you.",212,,
508,0.97,7922.848,7925.25,I am here.,212,,
509,0.97,7925.25,7927.653,Eight present.,213,,
510,0.97,7927.653,7932.758,Thank you Madame clerk.,214,,
511,0.97,7932.758,7934.626,And thank you for calling to the general public.,214,,
512,0.97,7934.626,7938.93,The Council will proceed with the business and resolution 31938.,214,,
513,0.97,7938.93,7941.733,"It is the fourth, again, it has been moved and Seconded.",214,,
514,0.97,7941.733,7942.768,We have had some discussion.,214,,
515,0.97,7942.768,7953.245,"At this point of the Council resolution is looking for the amended version exhibit B, version 2 as extracted to counsel, by Councilmember Herbold.",214,,
516,0.97,7953.245,7959.384,The resolution that is now before us is ready for discussion.,214,,
517,0.97,7959.384,7968.493,"Are there any additional comments or amendments to the resolution and the amended exhibit B, version 2.",214,,
518,0.97,7968.493,7970.562,This is Councilmember Pederson.,215,,
519,0.97,7970.562,7974.866,"Yes, please go ahead.",216,,
520,0.97,7974.866,7986.211,I just wanted to ask my colleagues if there is any interest and an additional amendment which would limit to Nonprofits and small business.,217,,
521,0.97,7986.211,7993.518,Small business being defined as 50 or fewer employees.,217,,
522,0.97,7993.518,8007.933,"Councilmember Pederson, is that an amendment he would like to present verbally, and if so, perhaps you could read the language that you are talking about adding?",218,,
523,0.97,8007.933,8012.604,"And for consideration, please do put your stuff on Mutes, if you are not muted.",219,,
524,0.97,8012.604,8016.641,This is Council member Pederson.,220,,
525,0.97,8016.641,8031.923,"I think the intent here is to support the small businesses and Nonprofits that are having to pay commercial rent during this crisis, and we heard that something from the Mayor's office is coming soon on this.",220,,
526,0.97,8031.923,8042.067,"One option is to wait for that, the other, then the other option is to amend this, to specify nonprofit or small business.",220,,
527,0.97,8042.067,8045.07,I guess I'm not prepared to offer an amendment.,220,,
528,0.97,8045.07,8051.777,"I just wanted to come if we are in discussion mode, to see if there was any appetite for that.",220,,
529,0.97,8051.777,8058.683,Think you Councilmember Pederson.,221,,
530,0.97,8058.683,8065.891,"Other Council, and he comments on the suggestion, it has not been moved as an official amendment yet, if you're like to move so, please do and please comment.",221,,
531,0.97,8065.891,8066.892,This is --,222,,
532,0.97,8066.892,8068.493,"Go ahead Lisa, sorry.",223,,
533,0.97,8068.493,8072.297,This is Councilmember Herbold.,224,,
534,0.97,8072.297,8108.533,"I support the idea of preserving the executive planned intentions, as it relates to this area, and think, creating some boundaries around what we mean by commercial landlord, and subsection B to specify that we are talking about small business and Not- For-Profit businesses, will give the executives the flexibility they are seeking.",224,,
535,0.97,8108.533,8114.94,Think you Councilmember Herbold.,225,,
536,0.97,8114.94,8139.965,"I think ultimately the place we want to go, is to make sure that any protections that we are considering, be we the city council or be we the executives, is for Nonprofits, and small businesses who are experiencing the brunt of the impact from the economic Fallouts of the public health response Covid-19.",226,,
537,0.97,8139.965,8168.793,"I guess, that my concern is just that, when we are talking about, now, changing the amendment, I am open to language if Councilmember Pederson if you had more specific language you were thinking about, I guess my concern is, I would become I am reluctant to put that language in kind of On-The- fly here at 6:09 P.M.",226,,
538,0.97,8168.793,8174.499,In the order that has been promulgated down to us by the executive.,226,,
539,0.97,8174.499,8186.545,"I would much rather work from the template of the order, like we got this order under residential Evictions, when the executive sent that order to us, soon.",226,,
540,0.97,8186.545,8191.983,It sounds like that would be tomorrow or sometime in the middle of this week.,226,,
541,0.97,8191.983,8198.023,"Then have that be the Templates, that we do our Tweaking, modifying, and changing.",226,,
542,0.97,8198.023,8212.437,"In terms of the options that Councilmember Pederson queued up just now, that would be my preference just to make sure that we do not accidentally omit something from what would be an oral amendment at this point.",226,,
543,0.97,8212.437,8219.811,"Or, that we may be reconvened once we have some, more resolute language put together.",226,,
544,0.97,8219.811,8232.357,"I worry that, considering this is not a resolution or ordinance that we are creating, but our imprint on an executive order.",226,,
545,0.97,8232.357,8241.132,"That would just be my preference and how to proceed, so we do not unintentionally hinder the order in some way.",226,,
546,0.97,8241.132,8242.2,Think you Councilmember Lewis.,227,,
547,0.97,8242.2,8247.439,"Councilmember Pederson, and Councilmember Herbold, I will weigh in briefly.",227,,
548,0.97,8247.439,8251.676,"I support as well, the concept that you are outlining.",227,,
549,0.97,8251.676,8258.583,And your suggestion to do an amendment to make it Nonprofits and small businesses.,227,,
550,0.97,8258.583,8262.287,"I believe what Councilmember Lewis is saying, is also a really good point.",227,,
551,0.97,8262.287,8287.412,"There is going to be another opportunity to make sure that we are Scoping and specifying that we are suggesting . Ites I do not hear anybody making an official amendment, and it does seem like there has been a desire to have an additional, you no thought put into any amendments to potentially be included in the next order that comes down from the Mayor's office.",227,,
552,0.97,8287.412,8321.546,"I'm going to go out on a limb, and suggest that perhaps, an amendment is very Well- received, and also I think at this point, perhaps if we leave the resolution, I'm sorry, the order as amended, I think we are going to have a lot of support for this Council for making sure that that narrowed scope specifics to small businesses and Nonprofits is very clear in the executive order as it pertains to commercial, rental, assistance, and the upcoming crisis.",227,,
553,0.97,8321.546,8334.559,"My suggestion per what Councilmember Lewis just put out there, is that unless there is a full motion to amend, we go ahead with the amended order, in front of us.",227,,
554,0.97,8334.559,8343.268,"Recognizing that it is a very good amendment that you would be bringing forward, to make sure the scope is clear, if not clear in the Mayor's executive order to come.",227,,
555,0.97,8343.268,8346.571,I appreciate the intent you brought forward to the discussion.,227,,
556,0.97,8346.571,8350.842,"With that though, what Apostasy there is any other comments or if a full motion had been made.",227,,
557,0.97,8350.842,8358.95,"Councilmember, thank you for the comments, I want a little bit more clarity.",228,,
558,0.97,8358.95,8373.631,"Are you proposing that we move forward then with the language that was before us, and that we sort of that was queued up earlier.",228,,
559,0.97,8373.631,8375.1,That is correct.,229,,
560,0.97,8375.1,8376.568,Okay.,230,,
561,0.97,8376.568,8413.938,"On that, my, I--I am hesitant to vote for sort of a broad moratorium on commercial rent where we are not getting more surgical, I do worry about large businesses that are not being impacted, or do have the capacity to pay, being interpreted as falling under the scope of the current amendment.",230,,
562,0.97,8413.938,8423.648,"But, I just feel like I'm in a place, where I do not know that we can make it more surgical, just orally, here.",230,,
563,0.97,8423.648,8430.054,"Unless someone has an idea, to throw it out there.",230,,
564,0.97,8430.054,8443.635,"I guess I'm just flagging my intent, my preference would actually not to be to vote for the broader prohibition on commercial, commercial rent.",230,,
565,0.97,8443.635,8451.976,And commercial Evictions until we have more specificity over the type of tenants that we are seeking to protect.,230,,
566,0.97,8451.976,8459.484,I just do not come I do not want us to be in a position where a large corporation could benefit from that language.,230,,
567,0.97,8459.484,8462.887,"I guess, that would be my concern.",230,,
568,0.97,8462.887,8464.389,"Unless I am wrong, and Allie can clarify.",230,,
569,0.97,8464.389,8470.795,But it seems quite the scope.,230,,
570,0.97,8470.795,8474.098,Could I Chime in.,231,,
571,0.97,8474.098,8476.968,Go ahead Councilmember Sawat.,232,,
572,0.97,8476.968,8479.504,Then Councilmember Herbold.,232,,
573,0.97,8479.504,8493.818,"Thanks Mac I agree with you, I think we should go ahead with the amended version today, because, as you said, and as others said, we made our intent very clear.",233,,
574,0.97,8493.818,8500.525,"Furthermore, I would say, honestly that any such amendment, I don't know if a formal amendment has been made.",233,,
575,0.97,8500.525,8511.102,"But I think any such amendment in my view, just based on statistical evidence as it is not big businesses ever in danger of being evicted.",233,,
576,0.97,8511.102,8512.737,Large corporations are not going to be evicted.,233,,
577,0.97,8512.737,8526.518,"One thing that distinguishes larger corporations from small businesses and the reason small businesses are even normal, and struggling is because they do not have huge cash reserves and large, corporations do.",233,,
578,0.97,8526.518,8541.366,"From an economic standpoint, I do not foresee such a situation, and Furthermore, I think we have clarified verbally, our intent on this.",233,,
579,0.97,8541.366,8542.7,Think you Councilmember Sawat.,234,,
580,0.97,8542.7,8546.638,Other comments?,234,,
581,0.97,8546.638,8553.745,"Hearing no other comments--sorry, I was on mute.",234,,
582,0.97,8553.745,8555.98,This is Councilmember Herbold.,235,,
583,0.97,8555.98,8564.689,"I just want to clarify we have three concepts, one is voting on the order as is.",235,,
584,0.97,8564.689,8570.495,"The other is amending its, to specify small businesses and Nonprofits.",235,,
585,0.97,8570.495,8581.172,"The other is striking it . In any of the last two instances, we will need somebody to offer an amendment.",235,,
586,0.97,8581.172,8594.986,"I do want to speak to the fact that I am sympathetic to the executives desire to limit this to small businesses, and Nonprofits.",235,,
587,0.97,8594.986,8613.538,"I was notified by one of the deputy mayors that the Hyatt is actually seeking to have the facility deferment apply to them, so I do not think it is unwarranted.",235,,
588,0.97,8613.538,8617.775,The desire to limit the scope of this amendment.,235,,
589,0.97,8621.279,8638.863,"Council colleagues come I'm not hearing a specific amendment put out there suggesting folks that there is some desire to see Nonprofits and small businesses, I understand that is the desire of the executive amendment.",236,,
590,0.97,8638.863,8640.264,We will be seeing more on that.,236,,
591,0.97,8640.264,8645.47,"Again, asking any specific amendment being proposed, I think there is going to be more conversation of this coming later this week.",236,,
592,0.97,8645.47,8654.946,"If anybody, if nobody is offering a specific amendment we have a motion in front of us on the underlying bill.",236,,
593,0.97,8654.946,8666.691,"Councilmember Mosqueda, this is Councilmember Pederson again.",237,,
594,0.97,8666.691,8700.191,"One question I would have, would be, is if an order is going to come down with more specific language, why we do not wait for that order, rather than pass a broader, speaking to the concerns that Councilmember Herbold just raised that there are commercial landowners who are probably in a position to pay and cover their obligations, any change that we make to this order will have the effect of law under the image, Mayors emergency powers.",237,,
595,0.97,8700.191,8708.132,"My preference would be to wait for more specific order if it looks like the broad, a more broad order to have unintended consequences.",237,,
596,0.97,8708.132,8716.24,"I mean, I am just having trouble with that, given that we know that something is going to come down, soon.",237,,
597,0.97,8716.24,8727.018,"It would be my preference, then when we get that, to work and modify that order the same way we have with all of the other orders that have come down from the executives.",237,,
598,0.97,8727.018,8733.925,I would rather have that be the template for this discussion rather than putting the commercial language in there.,237,,
599,0.97,8733.925,8745.67,"I guess that I am advocating more for the not amending, I would be interested in hearing a proposed amendment if there is someone that would want to propose language.",237,,
600,0.97,8745.67,8750.775,"I am looking at it right now, to see kind of where --",237,,
601,0.97,8750.775,8752.577,"Councilmember Lewis, I am sorry.",238,,
602,0.97,8752.577,8754.579,President Mosqueda.,238,,
603,0.97,8754.579,8762.787,"Just one moment, Councilmember Morales.",239,,
604,0.97,8762.787,8766.39,"No, of course.",240,,
605,0.97,8766.39,8770.061,"Okay, great, Councilmember Morales.",241,,
606,0.97,8770.061,8788.079,"I just want to say, so like what Councilmember Lewis is proposing, is suggesting is an amendment to strike the commercial portion of this version, in which case, my question, Councilmember Lewis, is are you offering an amendment to do that?",242,,
607,0.97,8788.079,8797.688,"Well, I think what I am advocating, would be that the amendment be rejected, then the order unaltered.",243,,
608,0.97,8797.688,8807.632,"I think it is, I mean, the order as it stands does not include commercial in it.",243,,
609,0.97,8807.632,8812.737,"So, I do not think I need an amendment to remove commercial from it.",243,,
610,0.97,8812.737,8814.939,"I don't think we already amended it, did we?",243,,
611,0.97,8814.939,8821.245,We have moved and Seconded to vote on the amended version.,244,,
612,0.97,8821.245,8833.257,"So I think Procedurally what I'm asking--I think Procedurally what I am advocating, is just not passing the amendment.",245,,
613,0.97,8833.257,8834.659,"There are, this is Councilmember Herbold.",246,,
614,0.97,8834.659,8839.53,There are a lot of other points in this amendment.,246,,
615,0.97,8839.53,8847.872,"I do not think we are talking about striking everything in the amended resolution, here.",246,,
616,0.97,8847.872,8855.58,"So, I do think somebody would need to offer an amendment to strike the words, commercial landlords.",246,,
617,0.97,8855.58,8859.65,"Well, if that is the case.",247,,
618,0.97,8859.65,8862.887,"You know, I think that, that is a motion I would be interested in making.",247,,
619,0.97,8862.887,8878.903,"But I would like to, maybe, if Councilmember Herbold or Councilmember Pederson have some language they were potentially thinking about, in terms of clarifying who it would apply to come I would like to consider something along those lines as well.",247,,
620,0.97,8878.903,8884.375,"But, those are the directions that I am leaning towards, rather than press, passing the broader language.",247,,
621,0.97,8884.375,8894.585,"Councilmember Pederson, did you have any language, I know you brought this up initially.",248,,
622,0.97,8894.585,8905.73,"I think our goal here is, we care about small business and Nonprofits, we want to, we want to give them relief.",249,,
623,0.97,8905.73,8909.6,We know the Mayor is coming down with something that has been Crafted over a long period of time.,249,,
624,0.97,8909.6,8912.236,Where it is being put together quickly.,249,,
625,0.97,8912.236,8915.506,Because we are responding to the emergency.,249,,
626,0.97,8915.506,8928.953,"So, I believe that, I am very open to, if we are going to get something better from the Mayor, then, strike commercial here, and have a more sustainable version tomorrow or the next day.",249,,
627,0.97,8928.953,8931.956,It may be worth waiting.,249,,
628,0.97,8931.956,8935.826,"Okay, thank you Councilmember.",250,,
629,0.97,8935.826,8938.229,Is that in the form of a motion?,250,,
630,0.97,8938.229,8956.547,"I will make the motion to remove, remove the expansion to commercial Evictions from the amendment.",251,,
631,0.97,8956.547,8959.583,I am just trying to see all the places where it is mentioned.,251,,
632,0.97,8959.583,8962.453,So in the beginning --,251,,
633,0.97,8962.453,8969.76,"Pause or a quick, to see if they had any quick announcements that they had done as we were chatting.",252,,
634,0.97,8969.76,8972.596,Just to make sure we are not Duplicating work.,252,,
635,0.97,8972.596,8974.198,"Hi, this is Allie.",253,,
636,0.97,8974.198,8995.086,"Thank you Councilmember, Council President . I am about to hit send on a version three of exhibit B that maintains the title of residential Eviction and removes other things that were added specifically to cover commercial tendencies.",253,,
637,0.97,8995.086,9004.228,And retain the other changes related to residential tendencies.,253,,
638,0.97,9004.228,9011.135,"I just sent it to you all, I think I caught everything.",253,,
639,0.97,9011.135,9040.031,"So, that is going to be a millionaire, or Jody can weigh in here, but it would be the motion to make an amendment to replace exhibit B version 2, would be to amend it by replacing exhibit B version 2, version 2 was Councilmember's Herbold version.",253,,
640,0.97,9040.031,9042.633,I appreciate all your work.,254,,
641,0.97,9042.633,9043.667,That Email is in your Inbox.,254,,
642,0.97,9043.667,9050.841,"I think for the public who is following along, it is a relatively simple concept, and it will be posted immediately.",254,,
643,0.97,9050.841,9053.244,If it is approved.,254,,
644,0.97,9053.244,9055.279,We will pause for a second as he read that.,254,,
645,0.97,9055.279,9069.26,"I will also look for a quick second, I also appreciate Councilm",254,,
