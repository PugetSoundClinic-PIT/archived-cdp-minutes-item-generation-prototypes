22,0.97,68.034,70.737,I'm going to dispense with the President's report in the interest of time.,14,,
23,0.97,70.737,81.247,We do have a very long agenda today with the state legislative session update followed by a presentation on the American rescue plan act of 2021.,14,,
24,0.97,81.247,99.265,"Then, we are going to do a preview of this week's activities and then we do have a rather long executive session that we need at least 45 minutes for.",14,,
25,0.97,99.265,102.969,Just asking folks to keep that in mind as you are giving your presentations today.,14,,
26,0.97,102.969,116.583,"That being said, I'm going to handed over to director Lily Wilson-Codega with our office of Intergovernmental relations to do introductions and we are going to dig right into the state legislative session updates.",14,,
27,0.97,116.583,117.55,Good morning.,14,,
28,0.97,117.55,122.889,"Good morning, thank you.",15,,

31,0.97,131.564,136.002,Quinn relations.,17,,
32,0.97,136.002,141.975,", Smith, government affairs director.",18,,
33,0.97,141.975,150.116,We are going to try to keep this to a very brief 20 minute state legislative update.,19,,
34,0.97,150.116,155.188,"If folks would be willing to hold your question to the end, we are happy to answer them or follow up with them Online.",19,,
35,0.97,155.188,157.891,We are very excited to have our Federal team joining us here today.,19,,
36,0.97,157.891,167.534,"Giving that slight change in agenda, we will start today's briefing with a legislative update followed by a Federal briefing.",19,,
37,0.97,167.534,181.748,"Our Federal affairs director and our Federal lobbyist who will be joining us live from Washington, D.C. for a briefing of the American rescue plan, the mass of $1.9 million congressional rescue package.",19,,
38,0.97,181.748,191.057,They will unpack some of the critical resources that will bring to our community.,19,,
39,0.97,191.057,201.234,"Another exciting news, and the Legislature, budgets are coming out with legislators dividing their time within committee and on the floor.",19,,
40,0.97,201.234,205.972,When will review budget activity more in depth.,19,,
41,0.97,205.972,216.482,"Before he starts us off with a full legislative briefing, I first wanted to note that Senate bill 5051, the decertification bill continues to move along having passed the Senate already.",19,,
42,0.97,216.482,221.187,It was exec'd out of House public safety last week.,19,,
43,0.97,221.187,224.424,The specific amendment language we were seeking no longer has a path forward.,19,,
44,0.97,224.424,235.868,"A special note of appreciation to Gonzalez, Herbold, and Morales for working so closely and variously with our team in an effort to incorporate this language.",19,,
45,0.97,235.868,244.711,"We weren't able to get there this session, but we really do appreciate the partnership.",19,,
46,0.97,244.711,254.287,"Again, while we are trying to hold question to the end today given time limitations due to our Federal and state briefing some I'm happy to follow up with any of you on this in more detail off-line if you like.",19,,
47,0.97,254.287,258.324,"With that, I will turn it over to Quinn Majeski, or stay relations director to start us off with an update.",19,,
48,0.97,258.324,260.593,All right.,20,,
49,0.97,260.593,270.703,"Beginning the budget and revenue space, last Wednesday, the state economic and revenue forecast Council released their updated revenue forecast.",20,,
50,0.97,270.703,278.645,"As we expected, it showed a increase in projected revenues and sort of improvement in the overall state budget situation.",20,,
51,0.97,278.645,283.149,I think that increase was larger than myself or many others predicted.,20,,
52,0.97,283.149,291.457,"The current biennium, the 19 to 21 biennium increased by $1.3 billion.",20,,
53,0.97,291.457,296.729,The revenue forecast and the revenue forecast for the following biennium increased by $1.9 billion.,20,,
54,0.97,296.729,319.686,That essentially Erases the rather massive shortfall that has deadly truck since summer and into the start of legislative session to the point where the current biennium that we are in has about a $500 million shortfall and the next one has 881--$81 million surplus.,20,,
55,0.97,319.686,326.893,"As I mentioned previously, this is a bit of a double-edged sword.",20,,
56,0.97,326.893,342.909,"It does mean that the programs, the key programs that we want to see funded and benefit from at the state level, are likely to at least continue at their current funding level if not see some targeted enhancements.",20,,
57,0.97,342.909,350.016,"However, it does mean that the need for new revenue and especially more progressive revenue is likely to see a further drop in momentum.",20,,
58,0.97,350.016,359.025,I think that anything beyond the capital gains tax and potential carbon pricing is sort of distinct from this.,20,,
59,0.97,359.025,370.536,Anything beyond the capital gains tax or carbon pricing is unlikely to see significant movement this session given the lack of need for new revenue based on this current forecast.,20,,
60,0.97,370.536,381.848,"As director Wilson-Codega mentioned, with the revenue forecast, that is sort of the final piece for legislators as they craft their budgets knowing sort of how much money they have.",20,,
61,0.97,381.848,387.553,"So, this week we expect the budgets to be rolling out.",20,,
62,0.97,387.553,392.024,"That is the operating budget, the capital budget, and the transportation budget.",20,,
63,0.97,392.024,399.766,"All of those are scheduled for hearings starting with transportation on Tuesday, and then capital and operating later this week.",20,,
64,0.97,399.766,405.438,"So, we will have more for you and follow-up over Email as those budgets are released.",20,,
65,0.97,405.438,415.381,"As Lily mentions, in the interest of time we are going to hold questions to the end, so I will pass it off to Hannah to discuss education.",20,,
66,0.97,415.381,419.852,"Thanks, Quinn.",21,,
67,0.97,419.852,425.758,"1213 and 5273, the House version has a House hearing tomorrow.",21,,
68,0.97,425.758,430.863,Both versions are scheduled for action later this week.,21,,
69,0.97,430.863,433.966,Both continue to move.,21,,
70,0.97,433.966,440.506,Senate bill 5321 is scheduled for an executive session later this week.,21,,
71,0.97,440.506,444.61,Those are the big updates.,21,,
72,0.97,444.61,449.081,A lot of our education priorities continue to move and I'll pass it off to Quinn for the environment.,21,,
73,0.97,449.081,458.024,"In the environmental space, the legislation that we are following that is still alive has made it past the various cutoffs to this point.",22,,
74,0.97,458.024,460.593,It all continues to move.,22,,
75,0.97,460.593,471.137,"House bill 1099, which incorporates climate action into growth management and conference of planning, Senate bill 5022, which has to do with producer responsibility.",22,,
76,0.97,471.137,474.707,Recycling.,22,,
77,0.97,474.707,500.867,"As well as the heel act, Senate bill 5141, are all slated for--they all had hearings last week and are slated for executive session committee votes this week the climate commitment act, which is the governor request significant piece of legislation, dealing with a captain and the best program is also scheduled for executive session on Tuesday.",22,,
78,0.97,500.867,504.604,"In the general government space, there is quite a few bills in here.",22,,
79,0.97,504.604,509.375,I won't highlight all of them.,22,,
80,0.97,509.375,512.178,The vast majority have already moved out of committee.,22,,
81,0.97,512.178,521.153,"That includes 1056, the future public meetings and States of emergency legislation.",22,,
82,0.97,521.153,524.991,"1173, this is the armory PDA legislation.",22,,

84,0.97,529.495,537.27,"Then, one other that I think is worth highlighting, House bill 1258, the Michael kitchen legislation has a hearing this week.",22,,
85,0.97,537.27,543.609,"In the Senate Agriculture water, and natural resources and parks committee.",22,,
86,0.97,543.609,546.979,I will hand it over to Hannah for Healthcare.,22,,
87,0.97,546.979,552.518,"Thanks, Quinn.",23,,
88,0.97,552.518,566.432,"House bill 1477, that is the bill that establishes the 988 suicide and behavioral health Hotline past the house on March 17th.",23,,
89,0.97,566.432,567.733,78-18 was the vote.,23,,
90,0.97,567.733,569.702,It has a hearing last Friday.,23,,
91,0.97,569.702,576.842,It is scheduled for executive session later this week.,23,,
92,0.97,576.842,579.612,Moving quickly now that it is a manor house.,23,,
93,0.97,579.612,589.956,"Senate bill 5068, which expands the Postpartum Medicaid coverage has an executive action scheduled in appropriations tomorrow.",23,,

95,0.97,594.827,598.764,"Now, let's Scroll down and get us to housing.",23,,
96,0.97,598.764,601.267,Good morning everyone.,24,,
97,0.97,601.267,619.085,"Perhaps the biggest news in the housing field last week was the governor extended the Eviction moratorium to June 30th, 2021, allowing time for the Legislature to pass tenant protections and allocate rental assistance funds and get programs up and running.",24,,
98,0.97,619.085,633.699,"Additionally, I just wanted to thank the Councilmembers who were able to sign onto the letter on House bill 1220 that makes some revisions to what must be accounted for in terms of affordable housing.",24,,
99,0.97,633.699,645.511,"Also, requires jurisdictions to allow emergency shelter and permit supportive housing in any zone where short-term rentals are located.",24,,
100,0.97,645.511,656.922,"I appreciate your Councilmember Mosqueda, for circulating the letter, and Council President Gonzalez, Herbold, Lewis, and Strauss, for all signing onto that letter.",24,,
101,0.97,656.922,659.325,It was very well received by our delegation.,24,,
102,0.97,659.325,667.633,"Also, executive action was taken in the Senate housing and local government Committee on the just cause Eviction bill, House bill 1236.",24,,
103,0.97,667.633,674.04,It was amended with changes that I would characterize as technical in nature.,24,,
104,0.97,674.04,676.876,"So, that bill is moving along and will go to the Senate floor now.",24,,
105,0.97,676.876,696.562,House Appropriations also took executive action on House bill 1277 which would give 100 million--would create an additional $100 million in document recording fees statewide for homelessness and rent assistance.,24,,

108,0.97,700.533,707.673,"That is the tactics bill that addresses choke holds, pursuits, military equipment, and a few other things.",24,,
109,0.97,707.673,726.392,"There were some additional amendments made to that bill that have resulted in an ongoing conversation, but I do expect any issues that have been created to be resolved and for the bill to move along to final passage in the Senate.",24,,
110,0.97,726.392,729.595,Executive action was also taken in the Senate law and justice Committee on House bill 1267.,24,,
111,0.97,729.595,735.701,That is the governor's request legislation to establish statewide centralized investigations for use of force.,24,,
112,0.97,735.701,737.97,That was referred to ways and means.,24,,
113,0.97,737.97,759.959,"Wrapping up the public safety for today, executive action was taken on Senate bill 5051, Lily actually mentioned earlier, the oversight and accountability of peace officers bill that would change the rules around the certifying police officers that had a hearing in the House this Thursday and an executive action was taken.",24,,
114,0.97,759.959,775.307,"Also, just shortening my report for today, you can see from the bulletin that there are several other police reform bills that continue to move Finally, just wanted to update everyone on Senate bill 503.",24,,
115,0.97,775.307,779.612,That would prohibit open carry at the state capital in public demonstrations.,24,,
116,0.97,779.612,787.953,Executive action was taken last week.,24,,
117,0.97,787.953,789.955,That is now being referred to the House Rules Committee.,24,,
118,0.97,789.955,797.863,"It was amended with some clarifying language on the definition of a weapon, and definition of demonstration and added a Severability clause, but otherwise the bill remains intact and it's mostly original form.",24,,
119,0.97,797.863,800.299,"Now, I will hand it back to Hannah.",24,,
120,0.97,800.299,808.974,"Thanks, Robin.",25,,
121,0.97,808.974,821.187,"The civil legal aid funds bill, 1072, and the restoration of voting rights for people convicted of a felony, House bill 1078, were both placed on second reading.",25,,

123,0.97,829.795,832.164,They were referred to ways and means.,25,,
124,0.97,832.164,840.272,This was a big highlight as a lot of our others continue to move forward.,25,,
125,0.97,840.272,844.977,I will pass it back to Quinn.,25,,
126,0.97,844.977,855.321,"Finally in the transportation space, not much on legislation here, but I will note the transportation budget is sort of the first step with hearings and House and Senate transportation tomorrow.",26,,
127,0.97,855.321,869.134,I do want to make a distinction that this is--the baseline current law budget is distinct and separate from a potential new revenue package.,26,,
128,0.97,869.134,883.349,"The baseline budget won't include any new revenue so it's unlikely to include probably much of note, except the one thing we will be looking out for is that transportation revenues have not largely bounced back the way that the operating budget revenues have.",26,,
129,0.97,883.349,890.055,"So, we will be on the lookout for any dinner referred or delayed project.",26,,
130,0.97,890.055,894.326,We are hopeful that that does not occur.,26,,
131,0.97,894.326,904.069,"So, I just do want to make that distinction that this is not the big revenue packet that we have been following that is continuing to be worked on behind the scenes.",26,,
132,0.97,904.069,909.775,That concludes our presentation and we are happy to take any questions.,26,,
133,0.97,909.775,910.976,Thank you state team.,27,,
134,0.97,910.976,915.247,I think if the state team can stay on we'll take questions after the end.,27,,
135,0.97,915.247,917.65,Yeah.,28,,
136,0.97,917.65,919.551,I think that sounds great.,28,,
137,0.97,919.551,930.562,"Colleagues, if you don't mind, if you can save your questions until the end of the Federal presentation we can take all state and Federal comments and questions at the end.",28,,
138,0.97,930.562,935.701,"So, let's plan to do it that way.",28,,
139,0.97,935.701,941.507,Has Leslie joined?,29,,
140,0.97,941.507,946.011,I don't think she is on yet so we may actually have time for a couple questions if we have them.,30,,
141,0.97,946.011,946.712,There we go.,31,,
142,0.97,946.712,951.383,"So, colleagues any questions or comments on the state updates?",31,,
143,0.97,951.383,953.986,Councilmember Mosqueda?,31,,
144,0.97,953.986,957.489,Please.,31,,
145,0.97,957.489,963.028,Just very briefly I want to say thank you again for all of the work that you have done on the housing bills and Legislations.,32,,
146,0.97,963.028,974.807,"For our colleagues that I think I wanted to sign on that letter, we work quickly with the office of Intergovernmental relations to circulate a letter at the housing and Finance Committee to make sure that we expressed support for House bill 1220.",32,,
147,0.97,974.807,986.952,"Doing so in public forum to try to get as many signatures as possible, especially from the housing Committee, seemed appropriate.",32,,
148,0.97,986.952,992.257,Apologies if you wanted to have signed onto that and you are wondering why you weren't included.,32,,
149,0.97,992.257,997.663,It was because it came from the housing and Finance Committee members and a way for us to circulate the letter and circulate before the hearing.,32,,
150,0.97,997.663,1003.569,"Thanks again for Oir for that, and apologies we weren't able to get it in front of the team on Monday.",32,,
151,0.97,1003.569,1011.944,"That would have allowed for our full Council to sign on, but I do appreciate the members who did.",32,,
152,0.97,1011.944,1018.684,"If there's another opportunity for us to express support for House bill 1220 as it progresses, I'm sure there's other members that would be interested as well.",32,,
153,0.97,1018.684,1021.887,"Thanks all, just wanted to provide that update.",32,,
154,0.97,1021.887,1028.394,"Thank you for that clarification, Councilmember Mosqueda.",33,,
155,0.97,1028.394,1032.498,We were moving very quickly so we just did what was most expedient to make sure Seattle's voice was heard.,33,,
156,0.97,1032.498,1032.798,Inc.,33,,
157,0.97,1032.798,1034.233,You very much for that clarification.,33,,
158,0.97,1034.233,1034.933,"Councilmember Sawant, please.",33,,
159,0.97,1034.933,1044.276,Thank you Oir staff for all the presentations these many weeks.,34,,
160,0.97,1044.276,1047.579,It has been extremely helpful.,34,,
161,0.97,1047.579,1059.324,"I understand that House bill 1236, which passed the house and is now in Senate includes a loophole that was added in with an Amendmentthat was added to the original bill.",34,,
162,0.97,1059.324,1078.41,"This loophole provides that--that where the initial lease term is between 3 and 12 months, a landlord may terminate the tenancy without cause at the end of the term by providing at least 50 days written notice.",34,,
163,0.97,1078.41,1087.052,"Before I go on, thank you, Robin, for following up with my office on the questions I had asked about the amendment last week.",34,,
164,0.97,1087.052,1090.055,"That's how we got the information, from your Email, so I really appreciate it.",34,,
165,0.97,1090.055,1100.866,This is obviously a significant loophole as it creates a gap for every tenant in Washington State who is on an initial term lease.,34,,
166,0.97,1100.866,1113.979,"My questions were again following up, is fine, do you know if house or Senate staff have an estimate on the number of tenants throughout the state that would be removed from just cause protection as a result of this loophole?",34,,
167,0.97,1113.979,1125.491,"Just to make a note I've asked the same question of this central staff this morning as we got the number of Seattle tenants in initial term leases, at least an estimate.",34,,
168,0.97,1125.491,1131.396,It's my understanding that this loophole was proposed by a Democratic leader.,34,,
169,0.97,1131.396,1137.469,Can you confirm that it was he who moved this amendment?,34,,
170,0.97,1137.469,1144.743,It would also be good if you can provide my office with a roll call vote on this amendment.,34,,
171,0.97,1144.743,1148.413,I understand you will need to reach out to Housestaff to get this information.,34,,
172,0.97,1148.413,1153.986,That would be great if you can send it to me off-line.,34,,
173,0.97,1153.986,1168.901,"I think it's important for committee members to understand who voted for and opposed creating this loophole that would potentially lead many tenants without just cause protections, but also of course we want the data as well to understand how much, how many of the tenants would be potentially affected.",34,,
174,0.97,1168.901,1169.701,Thank you.,34,,
175,0.97,1169.701,1175.44,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",35,,
176,0.97,1175.44,1185.617,"I will look into the exact mechanics of how the amendment happened, but I'm guessing that it was offered in an effort to make sure that the bill could move forward at all.",35,,
177,0.97,1185.617,1198.964,"I will check into the Dynamics of that and get back to you, as well as get you the roll call vote and see if I can find any information on the number of tenants who might be impacted by this change in the legislation.",35,,
178,0.97,1198.964,1200.165,Thank you.,36,,
179,0.97,1200.165,1216.281,"Just to give further context, obviously the tenants rights advocates they push for things that does not have these computations.",36,,
180,0.97,1216.281,1218.951,Just cause protection for all.,36,,
181,0.97,1218.951,1224.122,Obviously we would want that protection throughout the state.,36,,
182,0.97,1224.122,1230.095,It's in that context as well that we already have a better example of that which we would want Seattle to follow.,36,,
183,0.97,1230.095,1234.299,We also want the state to follow that so thank you.,36,,
184,0.97,1234.299,1235.801,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant, thank you, Robin.",37,,
185,0.97,1235.801,1241.873,We have learned that the other half of our Federal team has joined us.,37,,
186,0.97,1241.873,1246.545,Would you like us to reserve the rest of our questions to the end and move on with the Federal affairs presentation today?,37,,
187,0.97,1246.545,1247.813,I think so.,38,,
188,0.97,1247.813,1252.217,Let's go ahead and do that.,38,,
189,0.97,1252.217,1258.924,"Councilmembers, there will be an opportunity to address the state issues at the end of the Federal presentation.",38,,
190,0.97,1258.924,1272.638,"So, just because we are on a very tight schedule today, and I'd like to get us out of here before 1:45 p.m., let's go ahead and handed over to our Federal team.",38,,
191,0.97,1272.638,1277.409,Please introduce yourselves for the record and then I'm going to handed over to you for a presentation.,38,,
192,0.97,1277.409,1279.544,Good morning everybody.,39,,
193,0.97,1279.544,1284.449,Director of Federal affairs for our office of entered governmental relations.,39,,
194,0.97,1284.449,1289.955,Cochair of the local government group Holland and knight.,40,,
195,0.97,1289.955,1297.329,I'm just going to basically handed over to Leslie who is going to give us a summary.,41,,
196,0.97,1297.329,1303.268,I know there's a lot of planning and conversations happening both in the Mayor's office and with Council on how to use the funds coming in.,41,,
197,0.97,1303.268,1308.874,Questions on what funds are coming in.,41,,
198,0.97,1308.874,1316.448,"So, we don't have--we may not have a ton of specifics of the right answer to your questions, but we will make sure to take down all your questions today and get back to all.",41,,
199,0.97,1316.448,1318.283,"So, Leslie would you like to get us started?",41,,
200,0.97,1318.283,1320.552,"Great, thanks so much.",42,,
201,0.97,1320.552,1325.19,Thank you Council President Gonzalez for having me here today.,42,,
202,0.97,1325.19,1328.06,"Just two weeks ago, the American rescue plan was signed into law by President Biden.",42,,
203,0.97,1328.06,1331.697,What an achievement.,42,,
204,0.97,1331.697,1338.603,"I think this is the bill that many of us had been waiting for, which really provides comprehensive relief across the board.",42,,
205,0.97,1338.603,1353.785,"First and foremost, I know so many of you advocated for, or major voices heard about the importance of State and local direct assistance, and that has been provided to the tune of $350 billion.",42,,
206,0.97,1353.785,1366.031,Roughly $45 billion of that is coming directly to cities who received CDBG.,42,,
207,0.97,1366.031,1370.235,That's being done by a modified CDBG formula.,42,,
208,0.97,1370.235,1385.45,"Still waiting on final estimates from Treasury, the estimates from Congress have ranged in the $236- $239 million range coming directly to the city of Seattle.",42,,
209,0.97,1385.45,1397.863,"They have tried to be as broad as possible in their uses, but of course we are going to have to see how Treasury interprets this through its guidance, which we understand they are working on literally right now.",42,,
210,0.97,1397.863,1409.441,"So, the four main kind of buckets that are allowable uses are responding to the public health emergency, or its negative economic impact.",42,,
211,0.97,1409.441,1415.981,To provide government services to the extent that they have been impacted by revenue loss.,42,,
212,0.97,1415.981,1418.784,"To make necessary investments in water, sewer, or Broadband infrastructure.",42,,
213,0.97,1418.784,1422.788,"Or, to include premium pay for eligible workers performing essential work.",42,,
214,0.97,1422.788,1439.771,"I just want to note on that final, this premium pay issue, the way that the legislation has been written, both in terms of timing, how caps will work about this, we definitely expect to see guidance on that piece in particular.",42,,
215,0.97,1439.771,1443.408,The way that aid is going to be distributed is that Treasury will do it in two tranches.,42,,
216,0.97,1443.408,1449.681,"The first tranche, they have 60 days, from two weeks ago when the bill got signed into law, to get the first tranche out.",42,,
217,0.97,1449.681,1453.718,The second tranche will be released 12 months after that.,42,,
218,0.97,1453.718,1457.722,"So, it's really being divided into two equal payments.",42,,
219,0.97,1457.722,1463.328,There will be some reporting requirements as well.,42,,
220,0.97,1463.328,1468.099,"Again, the intention has been to keep this fund flexible, useful.",42,,
221,0.97,1468.099,1476.107,You have heard Treasury Secretary Yellen say what a priority it is to get this money out.,42,,
222,0.97,1476.107,1478.977,She has used this as a core part of helping the economy to recover.,42,,
223,0.97,1478.977,1485.55,We know that they are working as we speak to get that money out and the guidance out as well.,42,,
224,0.97,1485.55,1493.725,"In addition, as I know you have all seen, a number of tax provisions that will be very helpful.",42,,
225,0.97,1493.725,1497.562,There is a child tax credit that has been included.,42,,
226,0.97,1497.562,1500.665,And expansion of the ITC.,42,,
227,0.97,1500.665,1504.369,There is credits for paid sick and family leave.,42,,
228,0.97,1504.369,1506.571,These will now be expanded to state and local governments.,42,,
229,0.97,1506.571,1514.279,There are stimulus payments with many constituents may have already received.,42,,
230,0.97,1514.279,1517.115,Those checks are going out now to the tune of $1400 per individual.,42,,
231,0.97,1517.115,1531.897,"There's an additional $7.2 billion that is being released through an emergency conductivity Fund, essentially this is money that is going to be through the Earache program to schools and libraries.",42,,
232,0.97,1531.897,1536.801,The FCC Just-Released public comment on potential guidance for that that your I.T.,42,,
233,0.97,1536.801,1538.203,Department is aware of and has.,42,,
234,0.97,1538.203,1545.377,"There is a wide, kind of an expansion again, 15% increase in S.N.A.P.",42,,
235,0.97,1545.377,1549.281,Benefits that have been included in previous bills.,42,,
236,0.97,1549.281,1552.617,That has been extended through September 30th.,42,,
237,0.97,1552.617,1559.624,There is $122 billion that is going for K-12 to assist with reopening.,42,,
238,0.97,1559.624,1562.627,There is $40 billion going to higher education.,42,,
239,0.97,1562.627,1571.403,"Those funds are being given directly--50% is being given directly to students, 50% for institutions.",42,,
240,0.97,1571.403,1576.641,"There is $40 billion available for child care agencies, and an additional $4.5 million.",42,,
241,0.97,1576.641,1583.949,There's another $500 million that is being provided for water assistance grants to States to assist low income households.,42,,
242,0.97,1583.949,1589.654,"Just a note on that, that was a new program that was created in December.",42,,
243,0.97,1589.654,1593.525,Senator Murray was instrumental in helping to create that program.,42,,
244,0.97,1593.525,1601.032,We've been working closely with her office because HHS has gotten very bogged down in creating the guidelines for that program.,42,,
245,0.97,1601.032,1610.375,"As a side note, to me this is sort of an indication as to why Congress really tried not to create new programs.",42,,
246,0.97,1610.375,1618.249,"For this exact reason, we are now several months in, the money is still not out.",42,,
247,0.97,1618.249,1623.555,"Senator Murray's team is working very, very hard on this to try to help us get access to those funds.",42,,
248,0.97,1623.555,1626.591,As an additional $7.5 billion for vaccines.,42,,
249,0.97,1626.591,1633.665,An additional $47.8 million for contact tracing and testing.,42,,
250,0.97,1633.665,1640.005,"Then, there's a wide range of funding for housing.",42,,
251,0.97,1640.005,1641.373,$27.4 billion for rental assistance.,42,,
252,0.97,1641.373,1643.008,An additional $5 billion for housing vouchers.,42,,
253,0.97,1643.008,1647.312,That will go to public housing agencies.,42,,
254,0.97,1647.312,1656.087,"That's another $5 billion for rental assistance and roughly, close to $10 billion to assist homeowners as well.",42,,
255,0.97,1656.087,1660.892,"Finally, an additional $30 billion for transit agencies that will be flowing.",42,,
256,0.97,1660.892,1663.128,"So, that's just the tip of the iceberg.",42,,
257,0.97,1663.128,1673.938,"I know you all have our memo, and again, a lot of this we will be getting more detail as the months continue.",42,,
258,0.97,1673.938,1675.74,It is very exciting to see this.,42,,
259,0.97,1675.74,1684.249,"I would say as you are also seeing, next up on the agenda for Congress is going to be working through infrastructure.",42,,
260,0.97,1684.249,1699.264,"Today, the House Energy and Commerce Committee is beginning to mark up their lift act, which is kind of a wide range of climate change, Broadband ventures, designs to invest in the nation's energy and Broadband infrastructure.",42,,
261,0.97,1699.264,1709.074,We are seeing hearings this week with the transportation and infrastructure committee about the administration's priorities around infrastructure.,42,,
262,0.97,1709.074,1716.981,"So, I think it's going to take them several months to kind of come together with a plan and come together with the right course of action.",42,,
263,0.97,1716.981,1719.651,Will they do this through reconciliation?,42,,
264,0.97,1719.651,1721.352,Will they do this on a Bipartisn basis?,42,,
265,0.97,1721.352,1723.855,Maybe they do a little bit of both.,42,,
266,0.97,1723.855,1731.463,That will be kind of consuming the next week and months as we move forward.,42,,
267,0.97,1731.463,1734.265,Very exciting that they finally got the American rescue plan signed into law.,42,,
268,0.97,1734.265,1737.969,"So, happy to answer any questions.",42,,
269,0.97,1737.969,1740.572,"Sarah, please Chime in if I missed anything.",42,,
270,0.97,1740.572,1743.308,"That was great, thank you, Leslie.",43,,
271,0.97,1743.308,1745.877,"Okay, folks.",44,,
272,0.97,1745.877,1749.114,Thank you so much Leslie and Sarah for that presentation.,44,,
273,0.97,1749.114,1759.09,"We are going to go ahead and open it up now to colleagues, any questions that you might have either on the state legislative update, or the Federal update?",44,,
274,0.97,1759.09,1760.091,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",44,,
275,0.97,1760.091,1763.528,Thank you again Leslie.,45,,
276,0.97,1763.528,1765.396,It is always great to see you.,45,,
277,0.97,1765.396,1766.898,Thank you for sharing good news.,45,,
278,0.97,1766.898,1768.833,We are really excited.,45,,
279,0.97,1768.833,1771.402,Thanks for the constant updates.,45,,
280,0.97,1771.402,1776.374,I just wanted to say how much we appreciate the Play-By-Play and updates in real-time coming from DC.,45,,
281,0.97,1776.374,1787.051,"Appreciate how fast the administration is trying to move and how fast you, as advocates on behalf of cities like Seattle, are working to make sure we get clarity.",45,,
282,0.97,1787.051,1802.567,"Colleagues, again, the tranches that Leslie mentioned are really important both in the near-term and the long-term as we think about the buckets of funding to get us out of this recession and respond to the health crises in front of us.",45,,
283,0.97,1802.567,1815.48,"You will hear more as we talk about it, but one of the things we are considering along with public creation is in tranche one alone, having an immediate relief plan, and then a Longer- term, I should say Midterm funding as well.",45,,
284,0.97,1815.48,1835.567,"Leslie, I'm wondering in conversations you're having with other cities, is there other conversations happening around using tranche one, and trying to identify those immediate programs that are looking to fall off a cliff in June and trying to figure out some immediate dollars out the door as they figure out longer strategies for some of those near-term dollars?",45,,
285,0.97,1835.567,1838.069,Just in tranche one.,45,,
286,0.97,1838.069,1840.738,Those are part of the conversations we have been having.,45,,
287,0.97,1840.738,1848.012,I think a lot of cities are putting their plans together as we speak and sort of grappling with some of those exact issues.,46,,
288,0.97,1848.012,1854.185,"Recognizing of course, that these dollars need to be expanded by 2024.",46,,
289,0.97,1854.185,1860.525,"Then, also recognizing what a unique opportunity this is.",46,,
290,0.97,1860.525,1868.933,"Again, it's unlikely that we are going to see another Covid package, let alone one that would have this kind of flexible funding.",46,,
291,0.97,1868.933,1873.238,"So, people are grappling with exactly these kinds of issues.",46,,
292,0.97,1873.238,1889.654,"How fast to go, what kinds of investments to make, what's appropriate to go with the emergency in front of us, versus where we might be six months down the line when some of these critical programs have expired.",46,,
293,0.97,1889.654,1891.122,Councilmember Herbold.,47,,
294,0.97,1891.122,1895.76,Thank you so much.,48,,
295,0.97,1895.76,1899.163,Going to the state legislative agenda if I may.,48,,
296,0.97,1899.163,1906.971,I want to echo some of the concerns I have heard from Councilmember Sawant regarding the statewide just cause bill.,48,,
297,0.97,1906.971,1909.641,You may have heard me over the years referred to the Seattle loophole.,48,,
298,0.97,1909.641,1926.724,The Seattle loophole is the problem that exists in our city's just cause ordinance that allows good tenants to have their tenancy terminated at the end of a lease agreement for any reason or no reason.,48,,
299,0.97,1926.724,1944.075,"So, not only does the bill in the state Legislature no longer fix the Seattle loophole, which is what the original version does, it actually places the problem language in state law.",48,,
300,0.97,1944.075,1952.016,"So, before--there is no state law right now.",48,,
301,0.97,1952.016,1958.923,There was an absence of language in the Rcw about this problem that we have in our law.,48,,
302,0.97,1958.923,1964.028,There was a legal interpretation.,48,,
303,0.97,1964.028,1970.234,I know some of my colleagues on the Council were interested in pursuing a legislative fix that I certainly support.,48,,
304,0.97,1970.234,1985.55,"Again, I think this language that is being proposed to be put into state law really just Codifies the problem that we currently have in our city law.",48,,
305,0.97,1985.55,1989.253,"I agree, that's really, really problematic.",48,,
306,0.97,1989.253,2001.265,"On a different subject though, I do want to say how much I have really appreciated working, particularly with Robin in Lily on police accountability issues.",48,,
307,0.97,2001.265,2017.849,"Really appreciate all the hard work you have done and all the assistance of many police accountability Stakeholders, as well as the progress that we have made this session with some of our labor Stakeholders that I think is really important as well.",48,,
308,0.97,2017.849,2023.087,"On a related but separate topic though, I'm wondering if you could enlighten us.",48,,
309,0.97,2023.087,2042.006,What is the state's path forward to address the Washington state Supreme Court's ruling in state versus Blake as it relates to drug possession?,48,,
310,0.97,2042.006,2046.411,What is the state's path forward in addressing that?,48,,
311,0.97,2046.411,2049.313,"Are they looking at doing a special session, or bringing it up next year?",48,,
312,0.97,2049.313,2064.595,"Is there a way for us, like we do with our state legislative agenda, to give some perspective that the city might have about how that might be resolved?",48,,
313,0.97,2064.595,2076.04,"Councilmember Herbold, I can address that for you, although I don't have a buttoned up answer for exactly how the state Legislature plan to approach it.",49,,
314,0.97,2076.04,2078.342,There are definitely conversations underway.,49,,
315,0.97,2078.342,2089.153,"I think there is some diverging, maybe not diverging, but there is a discussion over several different approaches.",49,,
316,0.97,2089.153,2095.86,I do think there is a desire to make sure that it is funded at the state level.,49,,
317,0.97,2095.86,2106.771,"There are I think 126,000 people who are impacted overall by the change that the Supreme Court decision makes.",49,,
318,0.97,2106.771,2114.879,Something like 7000 people that are currently in Department of corrections custody will need to be Resentenced.,49,,
319,0.97,2114.879,2121.452,It is a significant issue and legislators to want to make sure that there are alternatives available at the local levels.,49,,
320,0.97,2121.452,2130.895,"Diversion programs, treatment programs, any things that we already have in Seattle that they want to make sure that all of those options are available statewide.",49,,

333,0.97,2211.375,2214.478,They actually closed all the loopholes.,51,,
334,0.97,2214.478,2223.354,I really hope that we can have a better path to closing all the loopholes for just cause protections.,51,,

342,0.97,2265.93,2274.338,"Now, I think the affordable care act takes a seat back to all of the incredible work that has been done on the American recovery act.",54,,

350,0.97,2311.976,2318.849,I also think it's really timely that you provided these details today as we are on the cusp of passing our resolution this afternoon.,54,,
351,0.97,2318.849,2327.391,That resolution provides the backbone to what the city's priorities will be when we add allocated those dollars and the city directly out to communities.,54,,
352,0.97,2327.391,2339.804,The 10 or 12 buckets that you see in terms of issue areas reflected in our resolution are intended to mirror what was in the bill.,54,,

400,0.97,2598.562,2606.67,"I don't care what the Cherokee County sheriff says, the attacks by these people were racist and absolutely inexcusable.",60,,

402,0.97,2615.446,2619.55,"They all deserve to feel safe in their communities, and they all deserve justice.",60,,
403,0.97,2619.55,2628.959,"We know that these attacks aren't rare, and that it is really a great shame on this country.",60,,
404,0.97,2628.959,2632.963,It is painful how many young white men are growing up with white Supremacist beliefs.,60,,
405,0.97,2632.963,2635.132,It is infuriating how regularly we see the tragic consequences.,60,,
406,0.97,2635.132,2651.915,"So, I want to again which the families of the victims, send them all our blessings and really just told our Asian- Pacific Islander community in our hearts this morning.",60,,

422,0.97,2755.853,2764.128,"Director Hayes is reminding us that right now, we only have one dose for every eight people who are eligible.",62,,
423,0.97,2764.128,2766.73,"So, it's going to be a rough few weeks.",62,,
424,0.97,2766.73,2770.4,Until we start to get more dosage in.,62,,
425,0.97,2770.4,2778.642,"She did mention that in April, they expect to double the dose is that Washington state is being allocated.",62,,
426,0.97,2778.642,2781.945,I know everybody is getting impatient to get their vaccine.,62,,
427,0.97,2781.945,2783.247,I have not been Vaccinated yet.,62,,
428,0.97,2783.247,2787.651,I still don't qualify.,62,,

435,0.97,2845.509,2864.027,"The contract was moved from Sbu to DOM, but we met with both offices and really want to thank Sbu, who has been working with the clean hands collective to create different Prototypes for how to make the streets safe program work.",64,,

439,0.97,2887.851,2898.428,Technical assistance will be provided to the recipients of this funding so that we can make sure we are tracking what is working and what is not.,64,,
440,0.97,2898.428,2904.468,"This will be a contracting process, not a grant process.",64,,
441,0.97,2904.468,2908.905,I'm told by the Department of neighborhoods the goal is to try to get the money out the door faster.,64,,
442,0.97,2908.905,2910.974,The anticipated date for that is in May.,64,,

446,0.97,2931.161,2949.012,"So, given that, we discussed that the best use of the $550,000 for this might be toward supplemental funding to support organizations who might experience a gap in funding for the 2021, 2022 school year.",64,,

452,0.97,2980.043,2985.349,We had about 150 seniors who were there to get their second dose.,64,,
453,0.97,2985.349,2999.563,"I want to share with you, for those 150 people, we had seven Interpreters speaking Romo, Somali, Swahili, and several other languages.",64,,
454,0.97,2999.563,3002.032,That is a lot of diversity for 150 people.,64,,
455,0.97,3002.032,3007.838,Most of the community members had walked to the community center from their neighborhood.,64,,
456,0.97,3007.838,3014.878,We had volunteers who had canvassed the neighborhoods in the prior weeks leading up to the distribution.,64,,
457,0.97,3014.878,3019.983,Everybody received a phone call two days before to remind them to come back for their second dose.,64,,
458,0.97,3019.983,3025.589,"They received another phone call a day before, reminding them to bring their vaccination card.",64,,
459,0.97,3025.589,3045.609,"The folks we spoke to who had come back and been Vaccinated, said that it was really that frequent touch, coupled with having interpretation available, and coupled with the ease of Accessing the site, that really made their vaccination process a success.",64,,
460,0.97,3045.609,3059.022,"So, I just want to thank again the Somali health board, and all of the Community-Based organization who are going that extra mile to make sure they are breaching people who don't have access, or can't get to the mass vaccination sites.",64,,
461,0.97,3059.022,3063.727,I think it is just another indication that we need several approaches to make sure everybody gets their vaccine.,64,,
462,0.97,3063.727,3072.302,I also met with institutes who were very concerned about the fact that our greenhouse gas emissions are not going down.,64,,

465,0.97,3093.523,3102.165,I think we all received a letter with a request to create a select Committee on climate.,64,,
466,0.97,3102.165,3104.701,That is something that they are willing to have a conversation about.,64,,
467,0.97,3104.701,3112.676,"I'm not sure that's exactly the right tool, but Nevertheless, folks are interesting to know what action we are going to be taking.",64,,

470,0.97,3127.29,3130.994,In the county really.,64,,
471,0.97,3130.994,3144.407,"I can tell you that as I walked with our group of about a dozen people, some of whom work at Lighthouse for the blind and are themselves blind, it was a very anxiety provoking experience.",64,,

590,0.97,3930.493,3936.299,This is making sure that people have access to guaranteed Healthcare as part of their job.,66,,
591,0.97,3936.299,3947.677,This is incredibly important as we remember that hotel workers are more likely to experience back injuries at a much higher rate than that of coal miners and building construction members.,66,,
592,0.97,3947.677,3953.816,"So, Healthcare was a key component of this legislation that we passed two years ago.",66,,

602,0.97,4012.675,4017.847,I mentioned that I sent a letter to governor Inslee two weeks ago.,66,,

606,0.97,4033.295,4044.774,Making sure that we extended the moratorium on Evictions through June is a huge proponent of making sure that there is more resiliency and stability for families as more of our economy opens up.,66,,
607,0.97,4044.774,4053.916,They have to have a place to call home and to be able to say home to stay healthy and also to stay civilized as we want our economy to stabilize and open back up.,66,,
608,0.97,4053.916,4066.595,"Thanks again to Jim Baumgart, John Flanagan, and Nick who I've worked with in the past . I can't believe I am Mispronouncing a last name.",66,,

613,0.97,4099.261,4107.036,"Recognizing that many of these essential workers, instead of being treated as such, were being treated as sacrificial.",66,,
614,0.97,4107.036,4120.95,"We cannot thank them for their sacrifice and let them continue to suffer higher rates of contracting Covid, high rates of death from Covid, and be more likely to experience working in positions that are paying minimum wage at best.",66,,
615,0.97,4120.95,4133.395,"Wanting to make sure that these types of changes that we have put into place, both in the city of Seattle and have done so recognizing the consequences of Covid.",66,,
616,0.97,4133.395,4140.002,This is all in response to the fact that we have already had an unequal economy to begin with.,66,,
617,0.97,4140.002,4153.082,"That type of income inequality that we saw experienced before Covid meant that we had to act quickly to step in to provide things like rental assistance, food assistance, additional protections for labor support.",66,,
618,0.97,4153.082,4160.923,The conversation I had a chance to participate in included members of the White House economic advisers from President Biden.,66,,

622,0.97,4180.509,4191.654,It was a really exciting opportunity to feature the work of Seattle city Council and I want to thank the members of the Brookings institution for reaching out and featuring our city so prominently in the National conversation.,66,,
623,0.97,4191.654,4215.277,"Also have a chance to join Council President Gonzalez as we were on a panel presentation for Latino advocacy week last week which helped to advocate for stronger connections between the Latinx community and make sure that we are providing updates from peer to peer, elected to elected, as we respond to the crisis of Covid and think about how our recovery efforts are centered on the Latinx community and all of those efforts.",66,,
624,0.97,4215.277,4217.88,Úit was exciting to be on that panel.,66,,
625,0.97,4217.88,4233.462,I met with John from the firefighter's Healthone team and got an update on how the health two band is going as we also position ourselves for opening up the third band that we funded last week.,66,,
626,0.97,4233.462,4235.698,Looking forward to having more conversations about opening up additional vehicles.,66,,
627,0.97,4235.698,4249.578,"Again my goal would be to have at least five vans, but I understand it's important to have the capacity to open up the Healthone.",66,,
628,0.97,4249.578,4259.922,"We need to open up more Healthone vans, it is more about recognizing what capacity Healthone needs in order to open up these vans.",66,,
629,0.97,4259.922,4263.125,That's why we put in the budget last year more funding for mental health services.,66,,
630,0.97,4263.125,4275.738,"Case managers allocating additional firefighter slots to Healthone, and freeing our firefighters from being under the fleet reduction policy.",66,,

632,0.97,4282.044,4293.422,"So, I thank them for their work and they are going to have ongoing conversations about how we create greater stability for Healthone, and future openings of vans for the different stations across the city.",66,,
633,0.97,4293.422,4300.129,I met with folks from the international community health services foundation regarding the capital projects that they are doing up on the beacon Hill site.,66,,
634,0.97,4300.129,4303.732,That is the North lot of the power.,66,,

638,0.97,4317.78,4328.991,"As Patty Hayes said, we have seen an Uptick in the number of cases with people relaxing their response to Covid.",66,,

666,0.97,4492.721,4502.931,She also has published a friendly amendment on today's agenda to have the fire Department explore the feasibility of an additional computer security feature based on the fire Department's responses during our committee.,68,,
667,0.97,4502.931,4506.134,That is published Online right now.,68,,
668,0.97,4506.134,4517.846,The surveillance impact reports are part of the so-called group 2 existing Technologies that we must examine thanks to the city's 2017 and 2018 surveillance ordinance.,68,,
669,0.97,4517.846,4525.254,We agreed to have a third committee meeting on April 7th to finalize the surveillance impact reports on existing Technologies relied upon by SPD.,68,,
670,0.97,4525.254,4539.801,"Please note that the next introduction and referral calendar may break up these five technologies, currently in one bill, and to five bills that we can be more nimble at the April 7th committee.",68,,

677,0.97,4590.052,4599.061,"The good news from an accountability perspective, it's not over when Council APPROVES these ordinances for the surveillance impact reports.",68,,
678,0.97,4599.061,4603.832,"Then, our city auditor and office of Inspector General work continue to review the Technologies after we approve the reports.",68,,
679,0.97,4603.832,4613.976,"At Committee, we also accepted Councilmember 120015 which is a Seattle city light rates.",68,,

681,0.97,4620.248,4624.586,The bill REAFFIRMS electricity rates for Seattle city light.,68,,
682,0.97,4624.586,4626.888,"This year, and for 2022.",68,,
683,0.97,4626.888,4636.898,I'm pleased that city light has managed to take various actions that will amazingly result in no net increase to customer bills this year.,68,,
684,0.97,4636.898,4648.71,"Each customer's bill is comprised of various electricity rates, Past-Due power rates, surcharges, and through a combination of actions, we can continue to present an increase in bills this year.",68,,
685,0.97,4648.71,4655.417,"Seattle city light will be keeping their promise for next year, 2022, by sticking with the original rate path agreed to back in 2018.",68,,
686,0.97,4655.417,4663.692,Possibly achieving a smaller increase if the pastor rate on the Bonneville power administration comes in lower.,68,,
687,0.97,4663.692,4667.529,I appreciate both Seattle city light and Seattle public utilities focusing on Affordability.,68,,
688,0.97,4667.529,4681.443,"So, you can take a look at that bill, which is on our transportation utilities committee agenda . There is a great Powerpoint presentation in there.",68,,
689,0.97,4681.443,4688.917,"City light is available to answer any questions, as is Eric Mcconaughey from central staff before next Monday.",68,,

697,0.97,4721.883,4728.59,"When I speak to business owners in my district, they tell me what they want now more than anything, our customers.",68,,
698,0.97,4728.59,4740.502,They want to see their regular customers return and welcome new customers because obviously they generate ongoing revenue needed to Rehire their workers and pay their commercial rent and other operating expenses.,68,,
699,0.97,4740.502,4756.585,"With phase three now officially in place today, to the extent you feel comfortable, mask up, head out to your favorite cluster of small businesses, whether it is Eastlake Avenue, North E 65Th street, Stornoway, University with, or whichever neighborhood businesses closest to your home.",68,,
700,0.97,4756.585,4757.686,Thank you.,68,,

702,0.97,4763.225,4766.294,Any comments or questions on that report?,69,,
703,0.97,4766.294,4767.796,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",69,,
704,0.97,4767.796,4773.468,I just had to take the time to address the menu for full council.,70,,
705,0.97,4773.468,4775.637,Thank you so much.,70,,
706,0.97,4775.637,4781.309,This is an amendment that was brought to my--or the need for it was brought to my attention during public comment.,70,,
707,0.97,4781.309,4797.225,This relates to the authentication use by the Seattle fire Department for their surveillance technology that we are working on.,70,,
708,0.97,4797.225,4803.465,The computer aided dispatch system.,70,,
709,0.97,4803.465,4816.044,Currently the Department uses a authentication system that is not a two factor verification.,70,,
710,0.97,4816.044,4818.947,Instead it is what's called a Token-Based authentication.,70,,
711,0.97,4818.947,4831.86,"It works by ensuring that each request for server is accompanied by a signed token which the server Verifies for authenticity, and only response to that request.",70,,
712,0.97,4831.86,4848.577,This amendment asks that the Seattle fire Department report no later than the end of the third quarter on the feasibility of using instead what's called a two factor authentication for access to data on the computer aided dispatch system.,70,,
713,0.97,4848.577,4856.218,"This adds a second piece of information, or a second layer that is needed before access is granted to an account.",70,,
714,0.97,4856.218,4865.026,"This prevents someone from logging in, even if they have access to a Password, thus adding another layer of security.",70,,
715,0.97,4865.026,4882.911,"The Seattle police Department has implemented a two factor authentication for their system and the Seattle fire Department has said that two factor authentication is required by Federal criminal justice information services on some of its system, including the fire investigations unit.",70,,
716,0.97,4882.911,4887.148,It is not a requirement for their computer aided dispatch.,70,,
717,0.97,4887.148,4890.418,They confirm that it is likely possible to set it up.,70,,
718,0.97,4890.418,4893.355,Though they don't know how difficult it would be to implement.,70,,
719,0.97,4893.355,4899.928,That is why this amendment asks that question of the fire Department.,70,,
720,0.97,4899.928,4907.068,How difficult would it be to implement this two factor authentication system and report back to Council at the end of the third quarter?,70,,
721,0.97,4907.068,4908.27,Thank you.,70,,
722,0.97,4908.27,4912.374,"Okay, thank you so much.",71,,
723,0.97,4912.374,4921.583,"Any other comments or questions on either the amendment as described by Councilmember Herbold, or Councilmember Pedersen's report?",71,,
724,0.97,4921.583,4921.816,Okay.,71,,
725,0.97,4921.816,4922.684,Great.,71,,
726,0.97,4922.684,4937.699,"Councilmember Pedersen, I did want to let you know I think my office communicated with your office, that we at this juncture did not have or intend to bring any additional amendments related to the bill.",71,,
727,0.97,4937.699,4940.568,"That we were briefed on, but didn't take action on.",71,,
728,0.97,4940.568,4942.771,I just wanted to close the Loop with you on that.,71,,
729,0.97,4942.771,4944.205,Thank you very much.,72,,
730,0.97,4944.205,4950.111,Appreciate that.,72,,
731,0.97,4950.111,4956.651,I know there are other Technologies we've got to deal with and want to make sure there is time in your committee to be able to deal with those bigger issues.,73,,
732,0.97,4956.651,4957.419,Thank you.,74,,
733,0.97,4957.419,4961.022,"Okay, colleagues, next up is Councilmember Sawant, and then Shouse.",75,,
734,0.97,4961.022,4962.39,Good morning.,75,,
735,0.97,4962.39,4964.326,"Good morning, and thank you.",76,,
736,0.97,4964.326,4970.632,There are no items on today's city council agenda from the Sustainability and Renters rights committee.,76,,
737,0.97,4970.632,4988.95,"Members of the public will remember the right to Council legislation which guarantees a right to every tenant facing Eviction to have an attorney, which was scheduled for a vote last week, but unfortunately the majority of the city council voted to delay the vote until March 29th.",76,,
738,0.97,4988.95,4991.953,"So, that boat is scheduled for next Monday, March 29th.",76,,
739,0.97,4991.953,4994.255,Not today.,76,,
740,0.97,4994.255,5008.97,"The legislation on right to counsel that was brought forward to my office and from the Renters right movements, and passed by the Sustainability and Renters rights community is the strongest in terms of the outcome it will have.",76,,
741,0.97,5008.97,5012.474,The strongest possible legislation on right to counsel because it does not have loopholes like means testing.,76,,
742,0.97,5012.474,5024.619,I appreciate many community organizations that have Co- authored a letter and send it to the city council so that the city council members will have that.,76,,
743,0.97,5024.619,5034.596,It URGES that the city council not include means testing they included very sound arguments to support why they say that means testing will be bad.,76,,
744,0.97,5034.596,5045.607,"Among other items that they have raised, the Eviction process in Washington state makes the use of means test unworkable.",76,,
745,0.97,5045.607,5057.318,"I think it means tested bad in general, but they are further also correctly pointing out, that specifically in Washington state it will be difficult until the day of their hearing.",76,,
746,0.97,5057.318,5061.823,Tenants do not come to court prepared to provide documentation or other proof of income.,76,,
747,0.97,5061.823,5072.233,"If a tenant is found to not be eligible because of their means testing, or otherwise don't have documentation, there will not be another opportunity for the tenant to obtain counsel.",76,,
748,0.97,5072.233,5080.809,I hope all Councilmembers' offices are able to look at that letter.,76,,
749,0.97,5080.809,5084.245,It has very valuable documentation of why means testing has been a problem in various places.,76,,
750,0.97,5084.245,5090.351,Why we should follow a city like San Francisco which has a right to counsel without means testing.,76,,
751,0.97,5090.351,5096.858,"The next Meetingof the Sustainability and Renters rights Committee is scheduled for its regular time, tomorrow, arch 23rd at 2:00 P.M.",76,,
752,0.97,5096.858,5105.733,We will have a briefing on the end of lease loophole in Seattle's just cause Eviction protection and how that loophole was closed in Federal way.,76,,
753,0.97,5105.733,5113.975,We will also look at the current House bill and cost protection statewide's.,76,,
754,0.97,5113.975,5122.35,"Troubling loopholes, especially initial term leases which was supposed and proposed by the house.",76,,
755,0.97,5122.35,5126.888,We just talked about this a few minutes ago.,76,,
756,0.97,5126.888,5138.8,That will provide the committee with overall background information so we can benefit future meetings which I plan to organize and discuss with Renters and community organizers.,76,,
757,0.97,5138.8,5143.304,"As the chair of the Sustainability and Renters rights Committee, I'm definitely committing to closing the end of lease loophole this year.",76,,
758,0.97,5143.304,5151.012,"As I mentioned earlier, do something my office has spent a lot of time over the last years think about and also looking for a legal way to do it.",76,,
759,0.97,5151.012,5161.022,"Like the current House bill 1236, of course the legislation that my office will be fighting for will contain no landlord loopholes, no exceptions.",76,,
760,0.97,5161.022,5180.141,"Every tenant needs to be covered by just cause protections, and for that we will need--it will not be enough to propose, we will need a Renters rights movement that will fight against corporate landlords and because without that fighting strategy we see what happens and we will end up getting something like what happened with the state house bill which was a very good bill.",76,,
761,0.97,5180.141,5183.044,"Then, ultimately amendments got added.",76,,
762,0.97,5183.044,5198.326,"On Tuesday in the committee, I will be announcing that we are dropping the resolution to strengthen the city's current just cause ordinance and I have asked central staff to begin working with my office immediately on the legislation dropping.",76,,
763,0.97,5198.326,5202.864,"As I said, the legislation would add no loopholes.",76,,
764,0.97,5202.864,5211.339,I believe the new Federal way law enacted by other initiatives serves as a useful template.,76,,
765,0.97,5211.339,5221.082,"I of course welcome all committee members, including Councilmember Morales, who would like to push for such just cause protections so that we can remove all loopholes.",76,,
766,0.97,5221.082,5228.99,I also plan to announce at the meeting that we will begin drafting legislation banning the use of credit checks and residential rental applications.,76,,

863,0.97,6233.994,6254.214,"And I guess, I just wanted to take this moment while I had everyone's attention to share this impact that I had about office hours, because again, without a scholarship, the difference per month is an $880 increase with the scholarship it's still a $500 increase.",78,,
864,0.97,6254.214,6266.66,"For a single mom who is having to work, juggling Childcare responsibilities, and then also having these costs skyrocketed, it has put an incredible burden on her shoulders.",78,,

881,0.97,6514.674,6521.081,"It also provides funding for evidence storage facilities, as recommended by the inspector general.",80,,

884,0.97,6551.111,6586.98,"It also provides funding for 2 million for the Participatory budgeting program, and central staff estimates that the $7.7 million from unfilled officer positions will be available during 2021 and that is where the funding for fulfilling the requests from the Seattle police Department as well as fulfilling the objective of adding additional funds from the Seattle police Department to Participatory budget come from.",80,,

889,0.97,6635.061,6645.839,"So even with any committee action tomorrow, it's very likely that any final full council action will have to wait until the monitor advise the court.",80,,
890,0.97,6645.839,6663.923,"I do want to note that the questions in the monitor's letter are questions to a certain extent are really focused on the introduce bill, not on the substitute bill, so I of course will be sending the monitor a copy of the bill as well.",80,,
