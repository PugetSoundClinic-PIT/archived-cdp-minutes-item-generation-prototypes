62,0.97,378.044,379.479,"Thank you, Amy, for sending that around.",12,,
63,0.97,379.479,381.681,"It is dated may 3RD, and these are your materials.",12,,
64,0.97,381.681,393.192,"Colleagues, this is the Ãšlegislation that ADOPTS the 2021 annual action plan in its final form at the first of each year to accept grant funds from the Department of housing and urban development.",12,,
65,0.97,393.192,406.739,"It describes how the city will spend for Federal grants, the housing opportunities for people with AIDS grant, also known as Harbaugh, the home investment partnership program, home funds.",12,,
66,0.97,406.739,432.632,"As a reminder, the city estimated that the grant funding amounts were in for programs, and appropriated in the 2021 adopted budget . in March, the city received notice of the final grant funding amounts and therefore, this legislation updates the annual action plan and the 2021 adopted budget with a final correct number.",12,,
67,0.97,432.632,433.8,There isn't a huge difference.,12,,
68,0.97,433.8,439.872,I will turn it over to Amy to walk us through what those differences are and a slight amendment we will also consider after we go into a public hearing.,12,,
69,0.97,439.872,443.81,But let's do an overview of what the legislation is in front of us so everyone can get oriented.,12,,
70,0.97,443.81,444.143,"Thanks, Amy.",12,,
71,0.97,444.143,450.316,"Thank you, I am Amy Gore from Council central staff.",13,,

73,0.97,453.252,457.123,"Yep, I am from the human services Department.",14,,
74,0.97,457.123,458.858,I manage these Federal grants with my team.,14,,
75,0.97,458.858,464.764,"Thank you, Dan.",15,,
76,0.97,464.764,466.232,"Councilmember, you gave a great introduction.",16,,
77,0.97,466.232,468.301,I wanted to highlight a few things.,16,,
78,0.97,468.301,477.443,The Council bill before us does five things.,16,,
79,0.97,477.443,479.178,It ADOPTS the final 2021 annual action plan.,16,,
80,0.97,479.178,495.962,It AMENDS the 2019 and 2020 action plans to reflect the Federal cares that the city has received as well as changes that were made in response to Covid-19.,16,,
81,0.97,495.962,501.701,"It APPROVES the Submittal of the plans, it authorizes the acceptance of grant funds and AMENDS the 2021 budget to reflect the actual amounts of these grant funds.",16,,
82,0.97,501.701,517.216,To dive into the most substantive thing that the bill does is to finalize the 2021 annual action plan.,16,,
83,0.97,517.216,536.669,"If you look at Table 1 of the memo, you can see that the final 2021 amounts are relatively close to the estimated funds that were included in the 2021 budget CDBG home PSG were slightly lower than expected and it was $200,000 higher than expected, but the net change across the program was approximately $6000.",16,,
84,0.97,536.669,544.61,"To reflect the changes in grant revenues, the plan makes relatively minor changes to the use of funds which are shown in Table 2 of the memo.",16,,
85,0.97,544.61,550.449,These changes require an amendment to the 2021 budget as shown in Table 3 of the memo.,16,,
86,0.97,550.449,556.856,"As noted in the memo, the appropriations table was going to require a memo to be amended.",16,,
87,0.97,556.856,569.335,That is attached--it is the final page . You can make corrections and make sure the 2021 appropriations are correct.,16,,
88,0.97,569.335,593.793,"The bill also ADOPTS amendments to the 2020 and 2019 plans, as I mentioned previously, they are also funds that have been appropriated by Council in previous actions, and this is just updating the APS to reflect that, and then it will be submitted and finalized by Dan's team so we can get those funds in the door.",16,,
89,0.97,593.793,596.095,So that is what this piece of legislation is.,16,,
90,0.97,596.095,604.804,And answer any questions for anyone?,16,,
91,0.97,604.804,610.643,"I'm not seeing any questions, thank you very much, Amy.",17,,
92,0.97,610.643,615.681,"Dan, is there anything else you would like to add, context for this legislation?",18,,
93,0.97,615.681,616.882,I don't think so.,19,,
94,0.97,616.882,621.187,Amy did a good job explaining what this is.,19,,
95,0.97,621.187,634.7,"The total amount of money we're getting from these grants is about $22 million, and we had a slight decrease this year from our previous years allocations, about 2%.",19,,
96,0.97,634.7,649.548,We are hoping not to see decreases every year or do research on that to try to predict the population changes that drive our allocations.,19,,
97,0.97,649.548,651.45,"Great, I would be interested in that as well.",20,,
98,0.97,651.45,670.036,"I did see from the memo that Amy provided that there was a slight change in some of the funding because of the demographics of housing characteristic changes noted on page three, and I would be interested in learning more about what that means.",20,,
99,0.97,670.036,676.742,"So if you have any additional context right now, Amy or Dan, feel free to provide that, I'm also happy to wait for additional information to come in.",20,,
100,0.97,676.742,679.412,I will put something together for you and send it to you.,21,,
101,0.97,679.412,681.781,"Amy, anything else from you?",22,,
102,0.97,681.781,682.114,Excellent.,22,,
103,0.97,682.114,686.786,I don't see any additional comments.,22,,
104,0.97,686.786,691.19,Let's go ahead and move to the public hearing.,22,,
105,0.97,691.19,702.468,"Colleagues, again, this is an opportunity for us to have a public hearing.",22,,
106,0.97,702.468,722.221,"This is the second public hearing on the annual action plan, as Amy noted, we took some assumptions that were made earlier in the year, once we get clarification for the final, we like to have this cleanup bill to address any changes in assumptions, and we also offer the opportunity for another public hearing.",22,,
107,0.97,722.221,725.124,"At this time, I will open the remote public hearing on the action plan.",22,,
108,0.97,725.124,734.834,Each Speaker will have two minutes for public comment.,22,,
109,0.97,734.834,745.544,"The comment time is now open, and we will begin with the first Speaker on the list.",22,,
110,0.97,745.544,749.014,"Before speaking, remember to push Star six so you can be a new date on your line.",22,,
111,0.97,749.014,750.85,I see one person signed up for public comment.,22,,
112,0.97,750.85,751.851,"David, I see you listed again.",22,,
113,0.97,751.851,757.356,"You are welcome, David, to present at this time if you would like to hit Star 6 to Unmute yourself, we would love to hear from you.",22,,
114,0.97,757.356,758.357,[Indiscernible],23,,
115,0.97,758.357,759.959,"Thank you very much, Madam clerk.",24,,
116,0.97,759.959,768.768,We will wait one more minute just to make sure he didn't accidentally get dropped off or is trying to dial back in.,24,,
117,0.97,768.768,776.242,"Again, if you do have additional public comment you would like to provide for any items on the agenda, you're welcome to Email us at Council @ Seattle.Gov and we will make sure to get that information circulated.",24,,
118,0.97,776.242,794.693,"Okay, if he is still not present, I don't see him on my end, this concludes the public hearing on the annual action plan, and we will go ahead and move to taking the technical amendment or any additional questions.",24,,
119,0.97,794.693,799.198,"Not seeing hands for additional questions, Amy, would you like to summarize the technical amendment for us one more time?",24,,
120,0.97,799.198,799.665,Absolutely.,25,,
121,0.97,799.665,830.696,"There is an error in the appropriation tables--I'm sorry, the two appropriation tables that are in the bill, one of them is in section 5, and one of them is in section 6. it is one table of how the money increases and how the money decreases, and it's just that those were divided up a little bit incorrectly, so this corrects the appropriations needed in the 2021 budget to enact the plan.",25,,
122,0.97,830.696,831.43,"Wonderful, thank you.",26,,
123,0.97,831.43,833.098,Are there any questions about that?,26,,
124,0.97,833.098,833.299,Okay.,26,,
125,0.97,833.299,850.649,Then I will go through this procedural process to make sure that we are including this in the appropriate ways according to the proper rules and orders.,26,,
126,0.97,850.649,857.556,"If there is no objection, council will be suspended to allow the committee to vote on a recommendation on the same day as a public hearing was held on Council bill 120059.",26,,
127,0.97,857.556,858.39,Are there any objections?,26,,
128,0.97,858.39,865.865,"Hearing no objections, the committee will proceed with moving a committee recommendation.",26,,
129,0.97,865.865,876.742,"At this point, I would like to move that the committee recommends passage of Council bill 120059 . is there a second?",26,,

133,0.97,880.846,894.493,"Hearing none, at this time, I would like to go ahead and add this technical correction that Amy just summarized, amendment one, is the amendment correct?",28,,
134,0.97,894.493,910.909,"It's a small change in the number on a table in section 5 included in the legislation, moving the number from 131,572 to 1000--1031 532.",28,,

170,0.97,1064.163,1082.514,"120039, an ordinance amending ordinance 126 237 which adopted the 2021 budget including the 2021-20 2026 capital briefing program changing for a possible vote.",43,,
171,0.97,1082.514,1085.951,"As always, thank you Mike for being with us, today.",44,,
172,0.97,1085.951,1099.097,"Central staff, and budget Extraordinaire who has been in this committee many a time, today, we are considering a carryforward or rents--ordinance is carried forward by the Mayor.",44,,
173,0.97,1099.097,1104.336,It is a bill that allows them to carry forward bills with unspent dollars.,44,,
174,0.97,1104.336,1123.522,"These dollars would typically be sent to the overall budget otherwise appropriated, and the purpose for the bill in front of us, today, is considered carrying those dollars into the 2021 appropriations for discrete programs.",44,,
175,0.97,1123.522,1130.963,"Thanks again to Tom Mikesell who has done incredible work on this and also provided information in the memo in front of us and will walk us in front of the legislation for the consideration, today.",44,,
176,0.97,1130.963,1133.832,"Thanks so much, Tom.",44,,
177,0.97,1133.832,1164.863,"And for the record, Tom Mikesell with central staff, and as you described, Madam chair, what I have, today, has provided an overview, not just of the bill but of the budget adjustment process at large, since it is a process that is year-long and has many different steps with the carryforward bill which is today's bill being the first significant one.",45,,
178,0.97,1164.863,1174.907,I put together a Powerpoint that will help describe some of these concepts.,45,,
179,0.97,1174.907,1179.945,"So generally, here is the roadmap for today's presentation.",45,,
180,0.97,1179.945,1185.551,I will briefly go through a background on the budget of adjustment process.,45,,
181,0.97,1185.551,1188.153,There is more detail in the staff memo.,45,,
182,0.97,1188.153,1190.389,The companies have a record behind this information.,45,,
183,0.97,1190.389,1198.997,"Some of it gets a bit Wonky, but it is useful to know because these themes will be present throughout the year.",45,,
184,0.97,1198.997,1223.021,"I will talk about the adopted budget, automatic carryforwards which is more of a technical exercise, Supplementals, which includes today's bill, and their brief discussion on exceptions, then we will dive into the bill on the agenda, talk about next steps, and then issue the identification for committees.",45,,
185,0.97,1223.021,1241.64,"So the first step in the budgeted process is, in fact, the adopted budget according to a state law, 30 days before the start of the fiscal year, the city council must pass a budget.",45,,
186,0.97,1241.64,1253.118,"That budget covers operations, generally, from January 1ST to December 31st of the next fiscal year, the operating components in the budget are what we call lapsing.",45,,
187,0.97,1253.118,1263.996,"So they go away to many further action in general terms, so most of those operating operations will go away at years end.",45,,
188,0.97,1263.996,1269.434,"Any capital budget appropriations pursuant to provisions of state of law, those do not lapse.",45,,
189,0.97,1269.434,1274.006,They continue into future years until formally adopted by the Council.,45,,
190,0.97,1274.006,1284.182,That is because a capital budget appropriation for projects that are significant can take a number of years.,45,,
191,0.97,1284.182,1308.106,"As you will recall on November 23rd of last year, council passed ordinance went to 6237 which is amended by--which would be amended by the bill that authorized the 2021 budget for all 6 1/2 billion dollars.",45,,
192,0.97,1308.106,1312.31,"The first step--and I will have a table that summarizes this, but the first step is automatic carryforward.",45,,
193,0.97,1312.31,1316.315,"This is a technical exercise that doesn't have an impact on the budget, though it does come to Council.",45,,
194,0.97,1316.315,1325.424,"That is because, as I mentioned previously, the capital appropriations that are provided in the budgets do not lapse.",45,,
195,0.97,1325.424,1334.032,So they continue from year to year until the project work is done or until the budgets are Aggregated by the Council.,45,,
196,0.97,1334.032,1336.835,So that is a significant component.,45,,
197,0.97,1336.835,1340.706,Next up is legislative adjustments.,45,,
198,0.97,1340.706,1354.553,"So, for grants, in particular, and also some other administrative adjustments, there are spending appropriations that are given, so these are operating appropriations that are given to automatically continue into the future.",45,,
199,0.97,1354.553,1368.166,"So that is something that is handled, technically, once Council gets the authority, it persists as work expenditure until they are fully expended or Aggregated.",45,,
200,0.97,1368.166,1390.455,And then further technical is the [Indiscernible]. These are just reserved for the city Finance Department to pay for promises to vendors for services that of--have been provided if we have not received the invoice.,45,,
201,0.97,1390.455,1400.799,We need to have the budget authority in order to pay those bills when it is essentially to make good on those promises that we've made to vendors and outside providers from writer your expense.,45,,
202,0.97,1400.799,1421.787,"So in total, there is $7 billion of this automatic carryforward budget that has been carried into 2021 fiscal year, and there is no further Council action required for us to take place because in all cases, it is either purely technical or prior authorization was given.",45,,
203,0.97,1421.787,1464.963,"So this next step is the significant point at which the Council does have a significant role in this current year, and this is with regards to [Indiscernible]. In regards to state law, the city can make adjustments to the budget from the emergency Fund, so I will read specifically from the law, since it's interesting, from the emergency budget or other designated funds, an amount sufficient to meet the necessary expenditures of the city for which no appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of making the budget.",45,,
204,0.97,1464.963,1477.375,So it's essentially saying that these additional supplemental appropriations are required because we are perceiving them of the budget was being Deliberated for the entire year.,45,,
205,0.97,1477.375,1479.177,The several mental bills have taken a number of forms.,45,,
206,0.97,1479.177,1480.445,We have the traditional form.,45,,
207,0.97,1480.445,1488.653,"Really, any increase to the budget is being made under this state supplemental budget authority.",45,,
208,0.97,1488.653,1504.302,"We have Standalone bills, in fact, there have been a total of six bills passed by the city council as of April 30th when I was preparing the materials that had a total of $79 million.",45,,
209,0.97,1504.302,1520.018,"I won't go into the detail, but those are covered in the memo, but those have been adjustments in appropriations through the supplemental budget authority.",45,,
210,0.97,1520.018,1523.188,The next kind of bucket of types of Supplementals is what I would term comprehensive.,45,,
211,0.97,1523.188,1549.447,And these comprehensive is--in the fact that they are citywide programs for just a small set of departments whereas more Copperheads of one's were a call to all departments made by the city budget office to kind of identify those areas that we meet the criteria and state laws surveying a request for an increase to their budget.,45,,
212,0.97,1549.447,1586.318,"So today's Council bill 120039 is the carryforward bill, which is essentially a supplemental bill that is characterized--and this is the chair, you described it well, it's money that would have otherwise lasted--it did last, in fact, and departments are asking in order to continue the program service for which the money was originally provided, they are asking the city Council to be increasing the budget to continue those programs to meet those objectives.",45,,
213,0.97,1586.318,1592.691,"And then a final piece, we have not seen one of those yet.",45,,
214,0.97,1592.691,1606.605,"Those are regular periodic Guilds we received from the executive, and they are comprehensive in that they cover citywide requests and are not discrete.",45,,
215,0.97,1606.605,1641.84,"I will talk a little bit in the next steps category about what the potential supplemental bills in the future--and then Finally, in the event after the year ends there are cases in which departments may have Overspent the authority that is granted by city Council, in past years, it has been transmitted--a request to provide budget authority for those areas where spending may have been greater than the authority [Indiscernible].",45,,
216,0.97,1641.84,1655.453,So this Encapsulates the status as of April 30th in terms of those various categories of adjustments.,45,,
217,0.97,1655.453,1674.873,"It is a very high level starting with $6.6 billion adopted budget--it was carryforward adding billions of dollars, Standalone legislation has $79 million billed between a revised budget of about a half billion dollars.",45,,
218,0.97,1674.873,1682.947,That is approximately 27% increase from the 2021 adopted budget.,45,,
219,0.97,1682.947,1693.391,"So I will just pause, actually, very quickly, to see if there are any questions about the overview.",45,,
220,0.97,1693.391,1703.501,Okay.,45,,
221,0.97,1705.537,1707.872,"I will say, thank you, Tom, for the memo you provided.",46,,
222,0.97,1707.872,1713.611,"If folks want to take a look at the summary starting on page two of the supplemental discussions, I think there's a lot to be proud of, here.",46,,
223,0.97,1713.611,1741.84,"Some of the Standalone ordinances that we passed including earlier this year, the $12 million that was included for Nontarget shelter services for hotel rooms, tiny home villages and enhanced shelter, you will remember the 23 million that just passed last month, that was related to rental assistance, and of course, the ongoing desire to make sure that the API community had additional supports as well, that was $1.2 million just to name a few of the pieces that we passed.",46,,
224,0.97,1741.84,1745.643,So we just thought those were important pieces to look up among the categories that Tom described.,46,,
225,0.97,1745.643,1767.766,"And Tom, thanks as well for including the 32 A060, because I think there's a lot of work to be done still to further understand how the city uses the supplemental budget process as opposed to state and other jurisdictions, so I will look forward to having more conversations with you about that, I appreciate you looking it up, there.",46,,
226,0.97,1767.766,1768.366,Of course.,47,,
227,0.97,1768.366,1784.082,"So now to turn to Council bill 120039, the 2021 carryforward, this is a bill that requests an appropriation rate--increased across all funds.",47,,
228,0.97,1784.082,1789.788,"There are several items, Ãšnumerous items in the bill as it does affect multiple departments across the city.",47,,
229,0.97,1789.788,1799.43,What I have included for today's presentation in the memo are some highlights to elevate for the committee's awareness.,47,,
230,0.97,1799.43,1815.413,The first slide I have are the items that represent significant changes to the departments budget.,47,,
231,0.97,1815.413,1816.681,They don't necessarily indicate an issue.,47,,
232,0.97,1816.681,1820.518,"There are no issues raised by central staff, it is just identifying the significant items that could be highlighted.",47,,
233,0.97,1820.518,1829.727,I would also note the metal has an attachment that shows a large table by Department.,47,,
234,0.97,1829.727,1843.041,"The information I showed in the prior slide from the adopted to revised budget, and that it places the requests that are being made through the carryforward bill.",47,,
235,0.97,1843.041,1848.112,It shows the amount and the percentage increase.,47,,
236,0.97,1848.112,1856.02,This is just to give a sense of how the budget is being increased for those departments as a result of this bill.,47,,
237,0.97,1856.02,1874.739,"So the first item I would highlight is a Million-Dollar general fund increase for the office of civil rights, office for civil rights, so this is actually a 14% increase to the revised budget.",47,,
238,0.97,1874.739,1885.683,"It is primarily for the execution of a project grant awards that were made last year, though have not been executed.",47,,
239,0.97,1885.683,1894.592,So the office is requesting that these monies be Reappropriated for those grant awards to be fully funded.,47,,
240,0.97,1894.592,1908.206,The next item is $4.2 million general fund increase to the OEM.,47,,
241,0.97,1908.206,1909.874,This is a sizable increase in percentage terms.,47,,
242,0.97,1909.874,1911.142,It's 152% increase to the budget.,47,,
243,0.97,1911.142,1922.921,"The reason for this Particuar increase is that there were a number of Non-Lapsing grants, so it kind of goes back to the automatic carryforward.",47,,
244,0.97,1922.921,1930.662,There are Non-Lapsing grants that have been awarded to the Seattle police Department.,47,,
245,0.97,1930.662,1935.133,So those functions have now been organized into OEM.,47,,
246,0.97,1935.133,1949.514,"However, the Non-Lapsing budget authority--given it is operating off of prior Council approval, technically, it can't automatically go to OEM.",47,,
247,0.97,1949.514,1965.663,"This is the executive signifying that along with other organization elements that these grants also should shift over to Oems management, and that is essentially what this increase is.",47,,
248,0.97,1965.663,1970.969,"The bill does abandon in the police Department, that same amount of funding.",47,,
249,0.97,1970.969,1973.838,I was towards these grants.,47,,
250,0.97,1973.838,1985.283,"It provides a Non-Lapse in provision to OEM so that these grants will continue in the future, you know, assuming Council authorization to add them to the budget.",47,,
251,0.97,1985.283,1986.351,So that's that item.,47,,
252,0.97,1986.351,1998.096,The next item is in the office of planning and community development.,47,,
253,0.97,1998.096,2023.121,"This is 124% increase, again, large increase, there is a reason why this represents largely $26.8 million for [Indiscernible] development and awards for civilizations similar to the Morales project--the words have been made or pending, and the authority needs to be there to fund the [Indiscernible] award.",47,,
254,0.97,2023.121,2032.296,It is matching the availability to money with the time of the awards.,47,,
255,0.97,2032.296,2043.708,"Then Finally, it is a small dollar amount, but the 13% increase in [Indiscernible] combined with revenues to continue the evaluation of suite and beverage tax.",47,,
256,0.97,2043.708,2049.013,"Last year, that evaluation was paused.",47,,
257,0.97,2049.013,2053.851,This continues the money so that evaluation could continue into the year and this year.,47,,
258,0.97,2053.851,2065.863,"This next slide, these are not necessarily notable on the percentage basis, that they are notable in terms of dollar amounts and in terms of Council transparency.",47,,
259,0.97,2065.863,2080.011,"One is a request of $72 million to the human services Fund, Hst, and this is for a Childcare facility project--they are awarded from the Childcare bonus funds.",47,,
260,0.97,2080.011,2096.36,"So these amounts, similar to highlights on the last slide, I think, is the minimum award, and the budget authority needs to follow up with those awards.",47,,
261,0.97,2096.36,2097.995,Next is the Seattle community and safety initiative.,47,,
262,0.97,2097.995,2099.73,This is for million dollars in Hst.,47,,
263,0.97,2099.73,2140.137,"These are one-time funds for Passageways for the community safety program, Similarly, the budget authority is requested to be available to [Indiscernible]. Then Finally, a $2 million increase from cumulative Reserve sub fund unrestricted in the Finance general Department, so this is the cities kind of holding pattern for funds, this is basically build out of the correction facility.",47,,
264,0.97,2140.137,2158.456,"These amounts were funded in 2020, however, given the Covid crisis, that has not taken place, we have those monies in finance general pending the ability to complete that project.",47,,
265,0.97,2158.456,2180.878,"I would note that the city's operating budget does include in finance general $4000 for partial year operations of these improvements this year, assuming Tht that is able to commence . So those are notable increases.",47,,
266,0.97,2180.878,2187.151,"Again, I will pause to see if there are any questions about any of the other items or the items that I have mentioned.",47,,
267,0.97,2187.151,2192.757,"Mr. Herbold, please.",48,,
268,0.97,2192.757,2196.961,Thank you.,49,,
269,0.97,2196.961,2200.398,I do have a question about the transfer from SPD to the office of CONVERGENT management.,49,,
270,0.97,2200.398,2213.277,You said the reason for that transfer was because some of the activities that the grant funds are activities that are now occurring in the office of emergency management.,49,,
271,0.97,2213.277,2234.732,"If you have that information, or if you could direct me to where I might find it, I just might love a little more detail on what sort of activities are now being implemented by OEM.",49,,
272,0.97,2234.732,2236.767,"Thank you for the question, Councilmember.",50,,
273,0.97,2236.767,2247.645,"I do, indeed have a lengthy Email that we received in the Q & amp; a from Opm, and we will forward it to you.",50,,
274,0.97,2247.645,2248.145,"Perfect, absolutely.",51,,
275,0.97,2248.145,2276.841,"And then on the community safety initiative, I was under the impression--there was $4 million and another 12 million, associated with capacity building grants for programs that could include the safety initiative or may include other types of community safety programs.",51,,
276,0.97,2276.841,2284.982,"I know the $12 million, they are still engaged in the artist paid process.",51,,
277,0.97,2284.982,2297.094,I was under the impression that for million had already been--was awarded after the summer supplemental.,51,,
278,0.97,2297.094,2300.164,I guess there wouldn't be a need for a carryover if that actually happened.,51,,
279,0.97,2300.164,2304.101,"I am just wrong, there.",51,,
280,0.97,2304.101,2307.838,I was thinking those dollars were awarded at the end of 2020.,51,,
281,0.97,2307.838,2310.775,"You are saying they are still not out the door, yet?",51,,
282,0.97,2310.775,2313.878,"That is correct, Councilmember.",52,,
283,0.97,2313.878,2317.915,The description of this item is essentially that.,52,,
284,0.97,2317.915,2328.125,"The award has been given, it's just ensuring the money is there to complete all the funding allotments that the word has been given.",52,,
285,0.97,2328.125,2332.029,It is simply doing that.,52,,
286,0.97,2332.029,2337.802,"Because it is a Non-Lapsing authority, we need to consider Re-Appropriating it.",52,,
287,0.97,2337.802,2346.911,"Okay, thank you so much.",53,,
288,0.97,2346.911,2349.18,So I will now move to next steps.,54,,
289,0.97,2349.18,2354.185,This is upcoming budget adjustments.,54,,
290,0.97,2354.185,2360.358,It's kind of consistent with my prior overview.,54,,
291,0.97,2360.358,2410.608,"So there are some additional Standalone Supplementals that are in the works, some of which have been recently discussed or preference in the Finance--and largely considering American rescue plan act allocations, significantly, there is $119 million which is the first tranche of the monies, then also, a smaller allotment which is the direct allocation of targeted a, home investment partnership plans, and there may be other targets that are upcoming--but those are two bills of the Standalone nature of which we are aware that will be forthcoming to Committee.",54,,
292,0.97,2410.608,2422.219,"And then also, the comprehensive Supplementals, so these are the ones that will be familiar to the committee members.",54,,
293,0.97,2422.219,2434.498,"We will have a second core supplemental, more likely than not, which is normally discussed and introduced in the middle of the year.",54,,
294,0.97,2434.498,2435.533,It includes a grant acceptance.,54,,
295,0.97,2435.533,2438.202,A large portion of that is to appropriate the monies for those grants.,54,,
296,0.97,2438.202,2450.881,"And then after that, during the summer budget process from October to November, council will receive a third quarter supplemental.",54,,
297,0.97,2450.881,2460.724,That is a part of the legislation that is similar to the second quarter that is accompanied by a grant acceptance.,54,,
298,0.97,2460.724,2485.883,"It is normally adopted alongside the timing of the budget adoption and, which in this case, will be the 2022 fiscal year, and then in the past, we have received a fourth quarter supplement a bill which comes after the process is completed in November, so it's a third community in December, and it also accompanies American settlements.",54,,
299,0.97,2485.883,2495.159,None of these bills are guaranteed or certain.,54,,
300,0.97,2495.159,2497.394,It's just kind of a Recap on how past processes have worked.,54,,
301,0.97,2497.394,2505.903,The fourth quarter process RAISES an issue that staff has highlighted for community consideration.,54,,
302,0.97,2505.903,2512.009,It is really with regards to the timing of when the fourth quarter bill is received.,54,,
303,0.97,2512.009,2538.302,"Since the fourth quarter bill is received in late November right around the time when the select budget Committee on the city council finalizing the resource and decisions for next year, then those decisions are made, and then there is the fourth quarter bill that's introduced.",54,,
304,0.97,2538.302,2551.215,"There's not much of a Deliberative Timeframe for that bill given the timing of its introduction, particularly, if there is a request Q & amp; a.",54,,
305,0.97,2551.215,2553.517,There is usually limited community time to have that discussion.,54,,
306,0.97,2553.517,2562.86,"Furthermore, it's a bit out of sequence with the larger budget discussion that is happening in the fall.",54,,
307,0.97,2562.86,2596.493,"Decisions are being made in the October/November Timeframe, that assumes some level of resources are available to be spent, which assumes some knowledge of how the current fiscal year is going to be completed, and then those decisions are made, and then a fourth quarter bill comes into play, and it just seems out of sequence, perhaps, that the resource decisions that are being made during the budget processes are not complete.",54,,
308,0.97,2596.493,2624.621,"And third, and this is a smaller issue, that there is some element of potential efficiency with the possibility that some of the grant decisions that are being made in the fourth quarter are unspent and go into the next years automatic carryforward, then at times, some that were requested in the fourth quarter possibly show up for for the request in the future.",54,,
309,0.97,2624.621,2627.524,"Again, not too likely, just raising that as a possibility.",54,,
310,0.97,2627.524,2650.981,"So the option--the issue is, given the Cramped Timeframe and the wedge between the end of the fiscal year and the full budget adopt option discussion, it RAISES an issue for the community's consideration.",54,,
311,0.97,2650.981,2684.081,"There is a third quarter supplemental that is traditionally introduced and discussed alongside the larger budget discussions that are being made for next year, one option could be to direct the executive to Marshal all those decisions to put them into the third quarter supplemental instead.",54,,
312,0.97,2684.081,2685.883,This option is not necessarily a light option.,54,,
313,0.97,2685.883,2688.686,"Would it mean, likely, is that the size and the scope would be larger.",54,,
314,0.97,2688.686,2735.332,"Departments would be required to be considerate for planning assumptions, try to avoid those items that would normally go into a core supplemental bill, then Finally, the size and the scope of the exceptions of the cases where the executive has Overspent budget allocations, the size and the scope for these exceptions could be larger [Indiscernible] this is where they were not sufficient to cover all known Variances at the time.",54,,
315,0.97,2735.332,2737.334,So that is kind of the offset of the option.,54,,
316,0.97,2737.334,2739.236,Another Ption is no action.,54,,
317,0.97,2739.236,2745.976,"Of course, one supplement her husband is a portion of the process.",54,,
318,0.97,2745.976,2756.153,That is a consideration for committee.,54,,
319,0.97,2756.153,2759.623,"Tom, I appreciate you outlining that in the presentation and also in the memo you provided.",55,,
320,0.97,2759.623,2778.175,"I think it is probably no surprise to this Committee and other colleagues here, and I have had direct conversations with the budget office and the director about the publications that arrive with receiving the fourth quarter supplemental a week and a half after we just pass the final budget for the year.",55,,
321,0.97,2778.175,2789.586,-- not to mention the sheer amount of work that would be required of central staff out of Council members to give it appropriate deliberations as Tom outlined in number one.,55,,
322,0.97,2789.586,2800.864,But the efficacy of us having to go through that process just weeks after having completing the budget process doesn't make a ton of sense.,55,,
323,0.97,2800.864,2821.718,"So I know the director has heard me loud and clear, he said I know they are beginning some official planning or looking into how they could mitigate the need for a fourth quarter which I really appreciate, and I think we will definitely be coming back to this list of options here as we endeavor to make it a more efficient system especially as the year-end wraps up.",55,,
324,0.97,2821.718,2831.228,So I want to make sure folks know exclusively what my preference is on that question that has been outlined in the memo and in the presentation.,55,,
325,0.97,2831.228,2836.6,"Tom, I also have a question for you on just general supplemental.",55,,
326,0.97,2836.6,2880.878,"I appreciate the outline you provided in the memo for us and the differences between the supplemental bills that can act as a Standalone, the annual carryforward legislation and the quarter Supplementals, I guess one of the things I want to explore with you as well is whether or not it makes sense to have an annual supplemental as well as a quarterly supplemental, and if there was a possibility of a combination that looks at carryforward legislation combined with a second quarter supplemental to make it one supplemental bill, and Ideally, moving towards an annual budget process is my annual if we can accomplish that.",55,,
327,0.97,2880.878,2894.558,"Do you have any thoughts about the concept of marrying, more explicitly, carrying forward legislation with a second quarter supplemental instead of quarterly Supplementals?",55,,
328,0.97,2894.558,2907.437,"Thank you, Madam chair, from past experience, I have seen where there have been two Supplementals.",56,,
329,0.97,2907.437,2936.099,"So similar to the option described where there have been busted of judgments and then budget adjustments for companies to final budget deliberations that Council, the carryforward supplemental appropriation is distinct and unique because it is looking for authority to continue some work that was provided--or that was kind of started or approved for a prior year.",56,,
330,0.97,2936.099,2942.472,"So there may be some desire--you know, I'm trying to channel with the executive might say, frankly.",56,,
331,0.97,2942.472,2972.235,"There might be desire to have some work guarantee that at least those items that are carried forward from the prior year would have some funding so that works that perhaps had been started prior could continue, and again, that would be an exercise of trying to either push the supplemental process earlier to match up with the carryforward, or find some middle ground that works.",56,,
332,0.97,2972.235,2979.009,"Again, I don't know the answer to that question, or whether or not it truly is a concern, I'm just raising it as a possible item.",56,,
333,0.97,2979.009,2982.212,"Functionally, they do the same thing.",56,,
334,0.97,2982.212,2983.413,They provide a bunch of authority.,56,,
335,0.97,2983.413,3005.969,"It's that unique characteristic that we carryforward, and what the executives communicating with the request--it would need additional scrutiny and perhaps communication to ensure that it doesn't hold any operational issues.",56,,
336,0.97,3005.969,3006.303,Excellent.,57,,
337,0.97,3006.303,3006.603,Thank you.,57,,
338,0.97,3006.603,3015.579,"We will add this to the ongoing list of ways we can improve this office--process, both for accuracy and efficiency.",57,,
339,0.97,3015.579,3016.38,Thank you.,58,,
340,0.97,3016.38,3023.32,I do have a question about a very small element of the carryforward.,58,,
341,0.97,3023.32,3038.034,"And that is, specifically, there are $20,000 in the full amount, but it's $20,000 for the Bennett Midland study on lead.",58,,
342,0.97,3038.034,3049.913,The report was expected in 2020 . My office has inquired a number times about its status.,58,,
343,0.97,3049.913,3066.163,"The report was completed as to its original scope, and they submitted that report as the pandemic started last year, and the report remains in the Mayor's office.",58,,
344,0.97,3066.163,3087.651,"And I understand that there are considerations of, perhaps, an expanded scope given the change in leads operations due to the pandemic I have another inquiry into the mayors office to check on that assumption and ask for the ability to review the report.",58,,
345,0.97,3087.651,3124.521,"I am just hoping that the carryforward item, as I understand it, in essence, authorizing or funding the expand of scope of the Bennett Midland report, I'm hoping by approving the carryforward, we are not sort of Incentivizing the delay of receiving the original completed narrower scope originally planned report that we had been seeking receipt of sense, I think, back in October.",58,,
346,0.97,3124.521,3149.045,"The report cares leads operations Pre-Pandemic operations, and is really critical to add value to our ongoing conversation around rebuilding community safety and avoiding the Traumas of criminal legal system involvement.",58,,
347,0.97,3149.045,3160.457,"Councilmember Herbold, I'm not aware that the money would preclude them from releasing the unskilled up report.",59,,
348,0.97,3160.457,3170.867,The carryforward bill is really not the mechanism to kind of communicate that level of intent.,59,,
349,0.97,3170.867,3174.371,We can follow up with the executive and learn more.,59,,
350,0.97,3174.371,3187.05,"Yeah, I'm not suggesting that approving it would preclude the sharing of the original scope report.",60,,
351,0.97,3187.05,3194.991,I'm suggesting we might be Incentivizing the continued reluctance to share that report with us.,60,,
352,0.97,3194.991,3222.018,"We are, in essence, providing the funding for the expanded scope for the report, and I'm just wondering--that might be inadvertently creating an incentive to allow them to continue to say, no, we are not going to give you that original report because we are desiring to do the expanded scope report.",60,,
353,0.97,3222.018,3229.926,I want to avoid that.,60,,
354,0.97,3229.926,3232.596,"Council member Herbold, I'm sorry to cut you off, Tom.",61,,
355,0.97,3232.596,3233.23,I have a suggestion.,61,,
356,0.97,3233.23,3234.231,I appreciate you Flogging that.,61,,
357,0.97,3234.231,3235.432,I wasn't aware of that.,61,,
358,0.97,3235.432,3245.842,I can understand how it is a lot of character and no stick.,61,,
359,0.97,3245.842,3259.522,"I'm wondering if between now and when it gets voted on Monday, if there's any indication that there is not going to be sharing information or the follow-up you have requested.",61,,
360,0.97,3259.522,3262.525,I'm wondering if there is a desire for a proviso on this or limitation.,61,,
361,0.97,3262.525,3264.027,"I would be happy to do that, too.",61,,
362,0.97,3264.027,3264.427,Thank you.,62,,
363,0.97,3264.427,3265.262,I would explore that.,62,,
364,0.97,3265.262,3267.664,"Unfortunately, the title of the legislation does not allow for a proviso.",62,,
365,0.97,3267.664,3269.733,So it could be a striking of that amount?,63,,
366,0.97,3269.733,3277.073,"That, I think, is an option that is worth considering.",64,,
367,0.97,3277.073,3278.875,So let's stay in touch on that.,65,,
368,0.97,3278.875,3295.058,"I think it is important you get answers to those questions, and I also want to assume best intentions that it will be shared, but we also don't want to be rewarding or a Warding additional funds if there are additional questions that are lingering and not answered.",65,,
369,0.97,3295.058,3305.468,"So happy to work with you on that as well, hopefully, this serves as a visible signal that we are interested in those answers Asap.",65,,
370,0.97,3305.468,3305.869,Okay.,65,,
371,0.97,3305.869,3312.275,Any additional comments or questions?,65,,
372,0.97,3312.275,3319.182,"Tom, did you have anything else on the question on the last line, there?",65,,
373,0.97,3319.182,3335.098,"No, I have nothing additional.",66,,
374,0.97,3335.699,3337.233,Central staff can work on amendments as needed.,66,,
375,0.97,3337.233,3340.837,I look forward to getting answers that satisfy the Councilmembers initial requests.,67,,
376,0.97,3340.837,3342.005,I'm not seeing any additional hands.,67,,
377,0.97,3342.005,3347.644,"Tom, thank you very much for your presentation.",67,,

380,0.97,3354.451,3356.453,Anything else for the good of the order on this side?,67,,
381,0.97,3356.453,3367.964,"See no major concerns, I will believe we can go ahead and entertain a motion to move this out of committee ending future conversations that Councilmember Herbert will be having and circling back to us before final vote in Council.",67,,
