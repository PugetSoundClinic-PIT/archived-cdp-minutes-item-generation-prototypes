Sustainability as part of our daily business yet in and arrow where we have nine years with the Cascading series of ecological disaster, how can the transit agency willfully give into delaying projects? it is ecologically an unfair by another agency.",29,,

123,0.97,1038.737,1048.147,All while minimizing a impact to organizations during construction.,31,,

308,0.97,2419.517,2441.372,"I am proud of my folks Intime who have been able to make incredible changes and to truly Pivot in terms of our priorities as an organization and as part of the city family . and to do so in a way that Uplifts customers, Uplifts Bipoc communities, and is beginning to focus on the equitable results that we want to see for our city.",81,,
309,0.97,2441.438,2443.641,"So let's go to the next Sli, please.",81,,
310,0.97,2443.707,2463.194,"Let me introduce folks first . Thank you for introducing Eric Mcconaghy but I have with me today, Maura Brueger, largely going to be my baby consultant,--my AB consultant, and participating his Seattleites, and Leigh Barreca, who may jump in a bit.",81,,
311,0.97,2463.26,2488.853,"Or for the sake of quickness, as you go through the Slis and in particular, as you look through the actual draft plan, you will find that a number of the photos that you see are actually part of the essentially Seattle project that Leigh Barreca worked on with the Seattle arts and culture group.",81,,
312,0.97,2488.919,2508.706,"The idea was to create work early in the pandemic for some of our artists and struggling art community, by engaging folks to take pictures of essential workers across the city, certainly not just city employees or Seattle city light employees, this is a project that I want to note that Seattle public utilities and Seattle city light largely funded.",81,,
313,0.97,2508.772,2517.248,"Some photos that you see in this presentation were taken by those local artists and photographers, and we were honored to work with them during this time.",81,,
314,0.97,2517.314,2520.951,"Next Sli, please.",81,,
315,0.97,2521.018,2524.021,"So, this is just a bit of history.",81,,
316,0.97,2524.088,2530.194,Over to your right you see the strategic land process was established by ordinance in 2010.,81,,
317,0.97,2530.261,2539.803,"This is our fifth plan, although it is in some ways our sixth, because we started a plan that would have come forward in 2020.",81,,
318,0.97,2539.87,2541.372,But we pulled it.,81,,
319,0.97,2541.438,2547.411,So typically Seattle city light does a six-year view of priorities and then a six-year rate trajectory.,81,,
320,0.97,2547.478,2559.223,What is different about the plan you are seeing today is that it is a five-year plan and the reason for that is to get us back on our typical biannual budgeting process.,81,,
321,0.97,2559.29,2567.731,"We are doing a one year plan, a one year rate, a rate strategy that the Council has already acted on.",81,,
322,0.97,2567.798,2570.634,So that is another thing that is slightly different than this plan.,81,,
323,0.97,2570.701,2582.513,Usually the rate piece would followed the plan but we went ahead and legislated that and used the amount that was in that 2018 plan that you see over on the corner.,81,,
324,0.97,2582.579,2588.719,"At the end of the presentation today, Kirsty Grainger talk more about the financial impacts and the rates.",81,,
325,0.97,2588.786,2595.693,"That is where we are, the review panel, as Council member Pedersen noted, supports the plan.",81,,
326,0.97,2595.759,2598.963,We had a fantastic time working on them with this.,81,,
327,0.97,2599.029,2609.74,"And they were really good sports, they did one plan and had to come back and do another and quite honestly they were going to stop in and start all over again here in a few months.",81,,
328,0.97,2609.807,2611.642,So they have been tremendous to work with.,81,,
329,0.97,2611.709,2615.713,"They represent, as you know the various customer groups.",81,,
330,0.97,2615.779,2630.861,"And there are five members appointed by Mayor, four by Council, and we have vacancies right now that we are working with Council member Pedersen and the Mayor's office to fill . So let's move on.",81,,
331,0.97,2630.928,2637.368,"So, this is just where we are in the process . We are going to go through the Slis fairly quickly.",81,,
332,0.97,2637.434,2644.341,"I doubt we will have a lot of time left for Q & amp; a, if we do that will be fantastic.",81,,
333,0.97,2644.408,2651.115,"If not we are happy to answer questions off-line, happy to meet with Council members, we are happy to answer questions with staff.",81,,
334,0.97,2651.181,2653.784,"We will be back on July 7th, at committee.",81,,
335,0.97,2653.851,2665.796,"And our review panel will be there to share thoughts and comments and answer questions and then moving forward either on July 12th or 19th, for the final action at Council.",81,,
336,0.97,2665.863,2667.798,Next slide.,81,,
337,0.97,2667.865,2688.452,"So, guiding our path, in 2020, actually beginning in 2019, Seattle city light updated the mission, vision, and values . The mission is largely unchanged, we Tweaked a couple words, it used to talk about delivering and now we are providing, because customers receive energy services in different ways.",81,,
338,0.97,2688.519,2696.026,"It also used to say electricity services but we are again noting that for customers, energy is a commodity.",81,,
339,0.97,2696.093,2703.267,"It provides comfort, light, it can provide all the things that we value.",81,,
340,0.97,2703.333,2711.175,And I think that we value them more now after the pandemic and living and working from home than we ever have.,81,,
341,0.97,2711.241,2726.523,But there are different ways of meeting the needs and we want to be cognizant of that and our vision is about creating a shared energy future by Partnering with our customers to meet their energy needs whichever way they choose . The focus is on partnership and customer choice.,81,,
342,0.97,2726.59,2735.699,"Our values are the way we do our work, the how we approach our work, and some are very well embedded in the organization today.",81,,
343,0.97,2735.766,2738.435,"For instance, environmental stewardship is very much who we are.",81,,
344,0.97,2738.502,2740.037,Customers first.,81,,
345,0.97,2740.104,2761.692,"And there is a reason that it comes first, because we are really pivoting and focusing and centering the work we do on our customers, with again special emphasis on equitable community connections and making sure that our product services are available to everyone in the same way . Let's move on.",81,,
346,0.97,2761.758,2778.642,"So, we did quite a bit of output and I would say that our outreach actually benefited from the pandemic in some ways . We were able to talk with more folks because it was less of an investment of time by doing it remotely.",81,,
347,0.97,2778.709,2791.088,"We had 10 Stakeholder group Hesitations across the board, lots of attendees, and as I said we had 22 strategic landing meetings with the city light review panel.",81,,
348,0.97,2791.155,2797.194,"And then again, a great deal of community and employee outreach.",81,,
349,0.97,2797.261,2802.766,"We shared materials, had a virtual town hall open to the public and shared employee meetings.",81,,
350,0.97,2802.833,2812.976,We really try to get this out . also as we developed the plan we not only worked with the review panel but we worked with groups of employees as well so they could see themselves in the work that we were doing with our review panel.,81,,
351,0.97,2813.043,2828.592,"That was super important to us . We know the key to engaged workforce is understanding how ""my work"" is tied to the goals of the organization that I work for.",81,,
352,0.97,2828.659,2830.26,We wanted to incorporate that throughout the process.,81,,
353,0.97,2830.327,2832.262,"Next slide, please.",81,,
354,0.97,2832.329,2852.416,"Despite the pandemic we made some amazing progress and I would like to point out here that the young woman, she will like me saying that, the woman on the left is Michelle Vargo, and she just as of this Monday is our chief operating officer, but we got a tremendous amount of work done.",81,,
355,0.97,2852.482,2860.757,"We made progress with our portal and brought the portal Online, increased enrollment in the EDP, by over 23%.",81,,
356,0.97,2860.824,2865.495,A big part of that was by implementing self certification during this time.,81,,
357,0.97,2865.562,2876.139,"We continue to invest in the critical infrastructure, including making good progress and achieving our goals with respect to the accelerated replacement program.",81,,
358,0.97,2876.206,2883.547,"We went live with the Western Pim, and we did that April 1 of 2020, which was pretty remarkable.",81,,
359,0.97,2883.614,2926.957,"We thought about delaying it but did not and it was a good year, the first your results in the Eim, exceeded $8 million . We earned the highest reliable public rating from the power Association, the rating they call is the Rpd 3, which is the reliable public provider, and the first time we ever--, we were awarded platinum status, the highest that they award . It speaks not only to the reliability of our system but also speaks to how we handle people and culture issues . how we handle safety and planning.",81,,
360,0.97,2927.024,2929.459,It is the big version of reliability.,81,,
361,0.97,2929.526,2937.234,General manager have vice chair Strauss with a comment or question.,82,,
362,0.97,2937.301,2937.668,Perfect.,83,,
363,0.97,2937.734,2938.468,Thank you for watching.,83,,
364,0.97,2938.535,2940.871,It is hard to see when you are presenting.,83,,
365,0.97,2940.937,2942.005,Council member?,83,,
366,0.97,2942.072,2945.042,I always have to the mute button.,84,,
367,0.97,2945.108,2947.11,Thank you.,84,,
368,0.97,2947.177,2961.558,"We had a great discussion before this meeting, talking about EDP enrollment being A. I wanted to take this moment to highlight the Western energy and balance market.",84,,
369,0.97,2961.625,2967.564,"Because when this legislation, when we were making the decision to enter into this market, we were the first public utility to do so.",84,,
370,0.97,2967.631,2985.382,"Which you all know, I guess I am just Rehashing this for the public, there was a lot of risk involved, a lot of uncertainty . and general manager, can you remind me, what was this year like for us in the Western energy market?",84,,
371,0.97,2985.449,2988.251,As I said it was very successful first year.,85,,
372,0.97,2988.318,2993.824,We had various estimates for what we did because of the city.,85,,
373,0.97,2993.89,3016.346,"Of course I was not here yet either Council member, none of us can take credit for it . But the folks that came before me and the folks that are still here make great decisions . So we looked at various business cases but exceeded our most likely, and like I said we made more than $8 million in additional revenue, during the pandemic.",85,,
374,0.97,3016.413,3027.858,"And I will also say, just as a quick reminder, the Eim deals with in our Variances.",85,,
375,0.97,3027.924,3033.029,So we balance our power and have a real-time desk.,85,,
376,0.97,3033.096,3059.222,"The physics of energy, which I will say I only partly understand, but the reason the lights come on when you flip the switch is because the system is always in balance . that is why we spill water at certain times of the year and even why Seattle city light in general is a long utility, which means by long, we have access to more power on an annual and generally even a monthly basis than our customers use.",85,,
377,0.97,3059.289,3064.361,"Within the day, within the hour, we are constantly buying and selling, in order to stay in balance.",85,,
378,0.97,3064.428,3071.067,With the Eim allows is for the most value from the in our transactions.,85,,
379,0.97,3071.134,3073.737,Those are critical.,85,,
380,0.97,3073.804,3090.353,"Last year with all of the Wildflowers, the public safety Shutoffs that happened in primarily California and in some other places, the value of being in the market, in that moment, was very high.",85,,
381,0.97,3090.42,3100.43,"When we look ahead to this summer, the prices for the spot prices are very high.",85,,
382,0.97,3100.497,3107.17,Being where we are positions us well for the future and you should know too that Tacoma is also in process now and will go live next spring.,85,,
383,0.97,3107.237,3108.171,Exciting news for them.,85,,
384,0.97,3108.238,3111.875,"That is great, thank general manager.",86,,
385,0.97,3111.942,3118.615,"It is great to hear that while we understood there was risk with enjoying the market, we have been rewarded.",86,,
386,0.97,3118.682,3142.239,Also highlighted on this Sli is our highest reliable power provider rating from American public power Association and for the viewing public I will highlight general manager Smith joined American public power association's Podcast and she did an amazing job discussing everything that we are talking about.,86,,
387,0.97,3142.305,3149.513,If you have not had a chance to listen I highly suggest it.,86,,
388,0.97,3149.579,3151.248,All right.,87,,
389,0.97,3151.314,3152.249,Next slide.,87,,
390,0.97,3152.315,3154.184,We will go through this strategic plan.,87,,
391,0.97,3154.251,3161.858,"I will not really talk about this like, this is an overly . Instead I will talk briefly about each of them and I will go quickly through them.",87,,
392,0.97,3161.925,3166.162,I will stop at the end of each to ask if you have a question or comment.,87,,
393,0.97,3166.229,3201.431,"Number one, again, customers first was the lead that you . improving the customer experience is the lead strategy . Our goal is to consistently meet our customer's needs by providing employees with opportunity to deliver targeted and responsible solutions . One thing we have become clear on is our employees in some areas, because of the pace of growth in the city of Seattle, which really did not even let up last year, the pace of growth is such that our employees struggle at times to keep up with their workload.",87,,
394,0.97,3201.498,3206.069,Especially those that deal directly with customers.,87,,
395,0.97,3206.136,3245.475,"We are working to empower them, give them training and development and tools they need to really deliver on that customer value proposition . We have a voice of the customer initiative we are working on . We are strengthening and fixing our core customer services . We call that the service to bill project and it is literally, we have gone through the process of identifying all of the pain points that a customer feels when they sign up for service or ask for new service at their home and hold the places they touch us and all the places that go well and all the places there is opportunity to do better . We are working on that.",87,,
396,0.97,3245.542,3249.179,"We are also expanding customer service options, Digitally, how do you deal with us?",87,,
397,0.97,3249.245,3255.819,"And also customer energy solutions side of the house, et cetera.",87,,
398,0.97,3255.885,3261.057,What are the products and the services that the customers of today want and need?,87,,
399,0.97,3261.124,3267.263,"I should have said, on each of the Slis, we have listed some of what we call Pia, project, initiatives, activities.",87,,
400,0.97,3267.33,3274.404,These are not exhaustive and just examples of things that we are particularly important to the review panel.,87,,
401,0.97,3274.471,3276.473,But there are others.,87,,
402,0.97,3276.539,3288.318,"And you know, this is a plan and we will update the plan next year but we will live with the plan for sometime to come . so as time goes on we will update the Pia.",87,,
403,0.97,3288.385,3293.957,Any questions about improving the customer experience?,87,,
404,0.97,3294.024,3294.824,Okay.,87,,
405,0.97,3294.891,3300.163,"I do not see any, let's move on . This is where we are super excited.",87,,
406,0.97,3300.23,3313.243,"You know, the time I have been here you have heard me talking about this, the future is now and it is our responsibility and our huge, huge privilege to create the energy future for Seattle.",87,,
407,0.97,3313.309,3323.086,There is a lot of words on this Sli but they are all important and all mean slightly different things.,87,,
408,0.97,3323.153,3332.495,"But the bottom line is, you know usually I will use this as an example, so forgive me if you have seen A. I need to go out and I need to get a Motorola flip phone.",87,,
409,0.97,3332.562,3369.132,"A lot of what we are talking about here, especially in the beginning, we need infrastructure and a grid that is capable of two-way communication, that is livable of handling the increased load of Electrification, that is capable of Self-Healing at a faster rate, and that centers our investments on Bipoc communities . My in-laws, who are in their 90S, and have done great through Covid, they have a very old Motorola flip phone . My father-in-law is legally blind.",87,,
410,0.97,3369.199,3377.907,"Despite the fact that the phone hardly works, he knows how to call people on the flip phone, that is all he can use it for . In many ways the city light's grid is the flip phone.",87,,
411,0.97,3377.974,3379.709,Nothing wrong with it.,87,,
412,0.97,3379.776,3387.317,"But it cannot run the Apps, you cannot text, it does not meet today's needs.",87,,
413,0.97,3387.383,3391.888,So you know my Iphone does and our goal for the greatest to update to the Iphone.,87,,
414,0.97,3391.955,3404.567,"And we believe this not just because it sounds good, we talked to people all the time and there is a lot of interest with Partnering with Seattle to make Seattle truly a city of the future .!",87,,
415,0.97,3404.634,3442.972,"Red can do a lot--a smart grid can do a lot for the city . You know Sam and I talk about this and he is probably on this call, Sam Zimbabwe, but certainly a smart grid will allow us to do things with our infrastructure that we cannot really think about today . The Pia is doing the grid modernization roadmap and working with consultants . any type of technology, having a roadmap and knowing where you are going in designing the architecture is critically important in order to make strong investments.",87,,
416,0.97,3443.039,3449.512,"We are in plummeting Electrification plans, that includes--, which you approved last fall.",87,,
417,0.97,3449.579,3455.018,It also includes the city's Electrification roadmap.,87,,
418,0.97,3455.084,3467.664,"We are working to find and implement the utility next portfolio, which is a group of 18 separate projects that have all been scoped, budgeted at a high level, and ready to shop and received funding.",87,,
419,0.97,3467.73,3490.486,"We have spent six weeks with a group of smart, motivated, bright city leaders back at the beginning of the pandemic . They created this portfolio in today we are continuing to work with folks at a national lab and Department of energy, who were part of the project team, and helping us find funding sources.",87,,
420,0.97,3490.553,3496.025,"We are ready for the for structure built to hit, and the funding to be available.",87,,
421,0.97,3496.092,3505.201,"Also even now we are tracking existing funding, working with the port on Electrification . just a ton going on.",87,,
422,0.97,3505.268,3520.683,"And Lastly, as we think about a new grade, it is integrated . in the past we did resource planning, kind of like if I have a funnel and put stuff at the top and it comes out the bottom, now we are talking about planning it very different way.",87,,
423,0.97,3520.75,3526.956,"Because the resources and where we are long and where we are short, are also dependent on the distribution system.",87,,
424,0.97,3527.023,3534.964,"We are integrating our resource planning, strategic planning, financial planning, and shifting the focus.",87,,
425,0.97,3535.031,3540.069,"We recognize we have a responsibility to our governing body, which is you.",87,,
426,0.97,3540.136,3546.276,To deliver the products and the work product that you need in the form you need them.,87,,
427,0.97,3546.342,3556.119,"But we have a responsibility also as leaders within the city Department, to operate our utility using the very best information available.",87,,
428,0.97,3556.185,3563.259,So we are focusing and really getting clear about what we need in order to be good stewards of the resources we are given.,87,,
429,0.97,3563.326,3568.631,Questions on this really exciting business strategy?,87,,
430,0.97,3568.698,3572.302,We will raise our we have got questions.,88,,
431,0.97,3572.368,3572.568,Okay.,89,,
432,0.97,3572.635,3573.703,Next slide.,89,,
433,0.97,3573.77,3583.746,The next three will go faster . They are super important . But they are more internally focused.,89,,
434,0.97,3583.813,3589.352,So we talked about the fact that the only way to deliver outstanding customer service is through engaged and outstanding employees.,89,,
435,0.97,3589.419,3603.032,"We need to continue to develop the workforce, and to build on an organizational agility and flexibly, the Nimbleness that we acquire during this last year.",89,,
436,0.97,3603.099,3610.206,We also want to make sure that our folks have skills and knowledge to advance social justice because it has to happen everywhere.,89,,
437,0.97,3610.273,3623.319,"We can plan for a year but if it is not implemented at the front line, an organization of 1700 to 1800 employees, we all need to be rowing in the same direction and we know that is the direction we want to grow . We want to build an agile workforce.",89,,
438,0.97,3623.386,3627.623,We want to prepare employees for the future.,89,,
439,0.97,3627.69,3636.599,Right now we have tons of newer employees who are super excited and then we have people kind of figuring out what their role is in this future.,89,,
440,0.97,3636.666,3655.051,"We are working on a Matrix type of approach so that we are not standing up new groups and old groups in terms of technology or direction, but that we are one utility and supporting our current organization while we are building the organization of the future.",89,,
441,0.97,3655.118,3660.39,And we are really focused on organizational change management.,89,,
442,0.97,3660.456,3683.279,"We have come to realize this past year that most places we struggle, whether it is through technology implementation, customer willing, you name it, it is because we did not have appropriate resources put to communicating with employees, communicating with employers, getting folks ready for change . We are setting up a small S.D.O.T.",89,,
443,0.97,3683.346,3695.525,"Practice, my chief of staff is heading it and if there are not Ocm resources available to support projects in the right way, we will not do the project.",89,,
444,0.97,3695.591,3700.196,Next slide.,89,,
445,0.97,3700.263,3703.066,Ensuring financial stewardship and Portability is of course incredibly important.,89,,
446,0.97,3703.132,3710.006,"And we want to offer rates that are again, a lot of words, but each one is important.",89,,
447,0.97,3710.073,3710.339,Transparent.,89,,
448,0.97,3710.406,3711.207,Understandable.,89,,
449,0.97,3711.274,3712.241,Reasonable.,89,,
450,0.97,3712.308,3713.242,Equitable.,89,,
451,0.97,3713.309,3714.944,Consistent.,89,,
452,0.97,3715.011,3726.422,"We want to make sure that vulnerable populations can afford our products and have a sustainable and predictable approach to setting rates . customers we know, customers value predict ability very highly.",89,,
453,0.97,3726.489,3740.436,"So as already discussed, with Council member Pedersen doing a great job at keeping this initiative up, we are--actions.",89,,
454,0.97,3740.503,3743.005,Introductory for sometime was not sustainable.,89,,
455,0.97,3743.072,3763.526,"We were frequently, almost exclusively having rate options that were in the 4% to 6% . and I came in and we said, we started talking about it . and my team, my senior team, they are equally committed to ensuring that rates going forward increase at about the inflationary rate.",89,,
456,0.97,3763.593,3770.967,"Right now we are working about 3%, as what we see as being with everything going on right now.",89,,
457,0.97,3771.033,3777.807,"And that is what you should expect from us, unless inflation starts to change at a different rate.",89,,
458,0.97,3777.874,3779.475,We want to price products for the future.,89,,
459,0.97,3779.542,3786.883,"We are continuing to plan for time of day pricing, which will be optional, opt in.",89,,
460,0.97,3786.949,3797.827,"It will be a rate strategy that customers can select and have the ability to price it, using historical data, before they hit go.",89,,
461,0.97,3797.894,3805.268,"It is slower than we planned, 2020 slowed us down from a technology implementation perspective.",89,,
462,0.97,3805.334,3808.337,As it needed to.,89,,
463,0.97,3808.404,3851.981,"And so that combined with lack of Ocm, and other things, we are looking at 2023 is the year that we can implement those kinds of rate strategies . But we are excited to do so when we have pilots that are in play and we are learning from the pilots on a daily basis . and Lastly, road to recovery . So this is the name we have given to our project, which is designed to work with customers who are negatively impacted by Covid and the economic downturn associated with it . to get them on payment plans, help them deal with Past-Due marriages, we are looking at a variety of funding sources .--marriages and helping to move them along.",89,,
464,0.97,3852.048,3862.959,"We are working with PSC, we are shaking every branch to come up with the resources that our customers need for us to help them.",89,,
465,0.97,3863.025,3867.23,"Okay, now next Sli.",89,,
466,0.97,3867.296,3880.543,"Lastly, this is our mission critical services, even as we prepare for the future.",89,,
467,0.97,3880.61,3886.716,We are managing the uncertainty of this Covid world and still learning every day.,89,,
468,0.97,3886.782,3920.516,"By the way we are having a Skagit Eap emergency right now . I am getting cute right now but it is an annual exercise that gets planned in great detail . So underneath we power great examples and that is where you will find the Relicensing, the accelerated replacement plan . There are examples and work under each business unit, under each division.",89,,
469,0.97,3920.583,3931.36,"In overtime, we are Piloting this right now but over time each division will have a dashboard that allows them to manage the key Metrics, things like reliability, you know lost days, et cetera.",89,,
470,0.97,3931.427,3937.166,And also key initiatives and how we are doing with those . next Sli.,89,,
471,0.97,3937.233,3938.868,That is the end of the strategy portion.,89,,
472,0.97,3938.934,3946.809,"I will turn things over to Kirsty Grainger, the Cfo, to talk to us about the right path.",89,,
473,0.97,3946.876,3949.445,Great.,90,,
474,0.97,3949.512,3953.516,So a little bit about the numbers part of our strategic plan.,90,,
475,0.97,3953.582,3965.194,"So you can see here at the top line of the chart, that is the rate path from the last plan that we brought to Council . back in 2018.",90,,
476,0.97,3965.261,3971.567,"Which is like a decade ago, or feels like it at this point, Covid time.",90,,
477,0.97,3971.634,3975.271,And you can see there the average for the six year plan was 4.5%.,90,,
478,0.97,3975.338,3988.351,"With the five-year plan that we are bringing forward to Council today, you can see that the average for that plan is 3.5% . These are the rating increases that underlie what Debora just described.",90,,
479,0.97,3988.417,4014.377,"And as a reminder, the financials underneath this include funding for all of the project, activities, and initiatives that Debora just described, as well as replacements and Relicensing . Also, I do not think we have a Sli as planned but as many of you are aware, our demand for electricity has been declining, as our customers get more and more efficient.",90,,
480,0.97,4014.443,4031.093,And so the rate path takes into account a flat and declining outlook for demand for electricity that we are expecting for the next while . until Electrification comes in and starts turning it back towards increasing.,90,,
481,0.97,4031.16,4034.363,All of that is incorporated in this financial that you have here in this great path.,90,,
482,0.97,4034.43,4037.066,-- rate path.,90,,
483,0.97,4037.133,4041.57,City Council has already approved the increase as you see here.,90,,
484,0.97,4041.637,4042.004,Thank you.,90,,
485,0.97,4042.071,4042.805,That was in March.,90,,
486,0.97,4042.872,4055.284,"And just as a reminder, the 2021 rate increase replaced a decrease in surcharges.",90,,
487,0.97,4055.351,4058.187,So customer bills in 2021 are unchanged of what they would see in 2020.,90,,
488,0.97,4058.254,4091.62,"And looking at January 1, 2022, we have legislated a 3.9% across the board rate increase, meaning it would be the same for all customer classes . However we are anticipating that news from the power administration, the federal agency that we get our bulk power from, they will announce rates later this summer and we have the rate pass through where we pass through the differences of our budget and the actual, that goes right into customer rates.",90,,
489,0.97,4091.687,4128.123,"Based on everything we are hearing we anticipate that what will happen is that the Bonneville Pass-Through will be a decrease, so when we combine the decrease with the 3.9% legislated increase, we think that what customers will see is something about 2%, maybe less, on January 1. we are looking forward to that and having good news for you on that this fall . This is just some bill increases that translate the percentages into numbers that folks might be able to relate to.",90,,
490,0.97,4128.19,4148.043,"So for an average residential customer, they would have a monthly electricity cost of about $77.00, and as a reminder a residential customer is billed every other month . So we have made all the numbers monthly but just a reminder that the billing cycle is different.",90,,
491,0.97,4148.11,4165.194,"That would translate to about $3.00, the 3.9% rate increase . and as I mentioned with the Bonneville Pass-Through coming, we think all the numbers on this chart for 2022 will probably be about half of what we show here on this chart, once the other part comes through.",90,,
492,0.97,4165.261,4167.129,That is just news to come later.,90,,
493,0.97,4167.196,4172.735,But these are just some billing paths here.,90,,
494,0.97,4172.801,4209.605,"And then Finally, just as a reminder, we are committed to making sure that all customers can afford electricity for their energy bills, we have the utility discount program, which offer 60% discount to qualified customers . We have a self certification process to make it easy for fairly's--easy for folks to join the program . We have a program that can help customers who are behind on their bills and that is administered by outside agencies that we partner with in the community.",90,,
495,0.97,4209.672,4241.337,"We have an emergency bill assistance program that was recently expended for 2021, using some Covid relief funds . There is some opportunities there for customers who might be behind on their bills . and we also have project share, another program and we are always working to increase awareness of all the programs . We know there is a lot of information out there but we are committed to helping new customers where they are and helping everyone who may be behind on their bills get caught up.",90,,
496,0.97,4241.403,4245.407,We have got a council member Herbold.,91,,
497,0.97,4245.474,4247.876,Thanks so much.,92,,
498,0.97,4247.943,4269.498,"While we are on the page about Affordability, I saw in the Seattle city light letter, they called out some successes, on a number of different pilots, but specifically I would be interested to know more about the energy equity rate Pilate . can you talk more about that?",92,,
499,0.97,4269.565,4286.448,"Sure, so the rate pilot is designed to reach a small group of customers that we know even with the discount offered by the EDP, they are still energy burdened.",93,,
500,0.97,4286.515,4293.455,I guess it is defined as 6% of your monthly income.,93,,
501,0.97,4293.522,4298.293,"If you spend more than that on your electricity bill, then you are by definition energy burdened.",93,,
502,0.97,4298.36,4309.371,"That program provides on average about 80% discount, no basic service charge and about a price of three cents per kilowatt hour.",93,,
503,0.97,4309.438,4323.085,"And then other services, like balance measurement, In-Home Weatherization, we are really trying to offer a comprehensive program to help customers who are energy burdened manage their costs.",93,,
504,0.97,4323.152,4328.857,"It is a small program, I want to say we have about 70 participants right now.",93,,
505,0.97,4328.924,4342.938,"To be honest the program launched right before Covid started, so as you can imagine some aspects like going into a customers home to help with Weatherization, just the conditions of the pandemic response have slowed down the efforts on that front.",93,,
506,0.97,4343.005,4355.818,So I think it is a great program and I am glad that we are trying to be creative about creating something that will help folks who are experiencing energy burdened.,93,,
507,0.97,4355.884,4363.125,But we are learning a lot and of course Covid has made it challenging as well.,93,,
508,0.97,4363.192,4365.494,Thanks for that.,94,,
509,0.97,4365.561,4368.163,Thank you.,95,,
510,0.97,4368.23,4372.201,And I believe this is actually our last Sli.,96,,
511,0.97,4372.267,4384.546,"What I wanted to do was just say, end with, our commitment . The programs that the city has put into place to help customers, they have never been more needed than now.",96,,
512,0.97,4384.613,4426.722,"And when I mentioned the road to recovery, you know it is perspective, and we have been thrilled to be able to enroll additional customers and we will begin potentially certifying customers this fall . No one who was self certified, who does not qualify will be asked to repay prior bills, but we continue to look at sources of funding to deal with funding . and I believe going forward the most important thing we can do as a public utility who provides critical services, the number one thing that we can do is manage our own rate trajectory.",96,,
513,0.97,4426.789,4433.428,"That is the commitment we are making here, to manage and make our services and ensure our services are as affordable as possible for everyone.",96,,
514,0.97,4433.495,4448.41,"The one thing we certainly have learned through this time is there are a host of people out there who are not EDP customers . The EDP customers, there are very few with Past-Due.",96,,
515,0.97,4448.477,4458.587,There are a lot of people who do not qualify for that program and when something like this happens are really struggling . So managing the rate of trajectory is radical.,96,,
516,0.97,4458.654,4465.227,Thank you general Smith and to your team.,97,,
517,0.97,4465.294,4472.601,I want to commend everybody at Seattle city light with her focus of controlling cost to pass the Affordability onto the rate payers.,97,,
518,0.97,4472.668,4491.753,"We know that utility bills by their very nature are Regressive and lower income Familie end up paying more from their household income . So by you controlling cost over the years, working with the review panel and employees to do that, you are able to show this amazing outcome.",97,,
519,0.97,4491.82,4511.24,"In terms of the old strategic plan at 4.5% average increase, down to now 3.5% for the five years, and if you look at the six years, including this year, you are down to like 3.4% . and we are expecting perhaps lower rates based on the Bonneville Pass-Through.",97,,
520,0.97,4511.306,4514.91,This is really good news for rate payers.,97,,
521,0.97,4514.977,4519.314,"Council members, any final comments?",97,,
522,0.97,4519.381,4526.388,"I know that we are able to hear back, and Council member Strauss has his hand raised.",97,,
523,0.97,4526.455,4547.976,"Thank you chair, Debra Smith and Seattleites . If you could slide back to slide 15, that would be helpful . I think this just demonstrates what Council member Pedersen said, you are keeping your rates as close to inflation as possible, which was not a previous practice.",98,,
524,0.97,4548.043,4570.332,"And Furthermore, in the past, often times Seattle city light would come back and ask for a higher rate than what was endorsed in the strategic plan . and you general manager have done a good job here in keeping us to the number that we have passed in the strategic plan . and I just have to Callout your leadership for that.",98,,
525,0.97,4570.399,4574.503,"Thank you, this is difficult work.",98,,
526,0.97,4574.569,4590.719,"It does not always occur . I will note that another fun fact that I learned listening to the Podcast, is that the understanding that the Federal Government really does provide the wholesale power for the country.",98,,
527,0.97,4590.786,4598.927,"And that it is local entities that do the retail, selling to the customers.",98,,
528,0.97,4598.994,4612.174,"That is in part why the rate, the Bonneville power rate is what drives our rates, because they set rates and we don't have control over that.",98,,
529,0.97,4612.24,4623.852,"So understanding that there is an aspect that you cannot control, general manager, and you kept the rate to inflation in your budget to what is endorsed, I cannot thank you enough.",98,,
530,0.97,4623.919,4627.522,Rate job to you and mark and Kirsty Grainger.,98,,
531,0.97,4627.589,4630.592,Thank you.,98,,
532,0.97,4630.659,4635.163,I do look forward to the Follow- up meeting.,98,,
533,0.97,4635.23,4646.208,"Let us know who additional information and we look forward to providing that to you and/or your staff . and we look forward to sharing additional information with you as we develop our dashboard, et cetera.",99,,
534,0.97,4646.274,4650.312,We do have an executive level dashboard which I think you will enjoy.,99,,
535,0.97,4650.379,4653.548,So thank you very much.,99,,
536,0.97,4653.615,4656.251,Thank you everybody next slide.,100,,

544,0.97,4673.001,4679.041,Will the clerk please read the title of the next agenda item into the record?,104,,
545,0.97,4679.107,4703.565,"Agenda item 5, CB an ordinance relating to Seattle public utilities; authorizing the general Manager/Ceo of Seattle public utilities to enter into a water quality combined financial assistance agreement between the state of Washington Department of Ecology and the city of Seattle, public utilities Department, to partially Finance costs related to the construction of the ship Canal water quality project through a clean water state revolving fund loan.",105,,

548,0.97,4717.012,4721.65,Welcome Seattle public utilities to the committee again.,107,,
549,0.97,4721.716,4733.795,"And this item, CB 120100, will approve a low interest loan as planned to finance $66 million of the $570 million ship Canal project.",107,,
550,0.97,4733.862,4771.333,"As you may recall this is a Mega-Product--project over many years, to prevent harmful Stormwater and wastewater from Polluting our local waterways . This project includes a new tunnel boring machine creating a 2.7 mile storage tunnel from Wallingford Ballard, this particular financing through the state government allows Below-Market interest rate of approximately 1%, whereas if we went to the conventional bond market we would pay a higher rate, around 3%.",107,,
551,0.97,4771.399,4788.283,"This will save approximately $12 million for this loan . I know Spu and King County have been doing a good job at financing and refinancing their debt to keep the cost low and take advantage of low interest rates, which then helps save money for our payers.",107,,
552,0.97,4788.35,4797.959,"Welcome Seattle public utilities, I want to just give Brian goodnight from the staff an opportunity if he wanted to say any introductory remarks.",107,,

563,0.97,4832.794,4834.129,The proposed legislation is straightforward.,110,,
564,0.97,4834.196,4850.512,It would authorize Spu to accept the $66 million low interest loan from the Washington Department of Ecology for the ship Canal project and I believe you have briefing materials on the overall budget and status in your packet.,110,,
565,0.97,4850.579,4854.216,We would be very happy to provide individual briefings and other time if you would like.,110,,

575,0.97,4927.656,4977.439,"So in the city since 2013, under a Federal consent to create--by the Department of Ecology to bring our 82 overflow locations throughout the city down to a performance criteria that each overflow cannot overflow more than one combined sewage overflow at that specific Outfall per year on a 20 year moving average . and by far our load just--largest are by the ship Canal . The areas in green are County basins, the areas in pink are the city of Seattle basins, you can see that we join together a joint project, the ship Canal project, to bring six of the overflow locations two for the county and Portage for the county, down to meet the standard.",113,,
576,0.97,4977.505,4982.344,We signed an agreement that has the cost of approximately 65% for the city of Seattle and 35% for the county.,113,,
577,0.97,4982.41,4989.918,The overall budget for the Medco project is $575 million and that was set at a 65% COMP in 2018.,113,,
578,0.97,4989.984,4997.692,And that means that the project is 65% likely to be delivered at or above the budget.,113,,
579,0.97,4997.759,5007.469,"I am happy to say that after three years of a very Herculean effort, we are still on track at that same budget and same COMP.",113,,
580,0.97,5007.535,5015.877,"So moving on to a little bit about the project itself, what you see here are the five neighborhoods where we have the overflow locations.",113,,
581,0.97,5015.944,5018.646,We must be working in those areas.,113,,
582,0.97,5018.713,5068.229,"And we are in the process of just starting a 2.7 mile along tunnel that goes from Ballard, to Longford, and 18 foot 10 inch diameter that will provide about 30 million gallons of storage, essentially an underground storage tank . In each neighborhood we need to build deep shafts to bring the water down into the tunnel . at the end of completion of the tunnel in early 2013, we will build a large pump station in Ballard to drain the tunnel to the treatment plant, when the plant is ready to take that . I also want to clarify that we have a second tunnel we are almost getting ready to put in, eight foot diameter tunnel, underneath the ship Canal . So a lot of work, at the neighborhoods.",113,,
583,0.97,5068.296,5084.979,"What I neglected to mention is that we need to have the project complete and operational 4 1/2 years from now, from the end of 2025, according to our consent decree . Now I will turn this over to Ben Marre, who will talk about our model.",113,,
584,0.97,5085.046,5086.08,Good morning.,114,,
585,0.97,5086.147,5087.015,Thanks Keith.,114,,
586,0.97,5087.081,5098.626,"We are here today to vote on clean water state revolving fund loan for the project, the third of four loans that we have pursued.",114,,
587,0.97,5098.693,5123.184,"Today's is a $65 million loan for cost associated with the storage tunnel construction . a very low interest rate of 1.2% over 20 years, which is a lower rate that we could obtain on a conventional bond market . conventional financing, and it saves Ratepayers approximately $12 million in cost.",114,,
588,0.97,5123.251,5135.864,"So I mentioned that this is the third O█F four loans that we have pursued an already pursued a similar clean water revolving, state revolving fund loan in 2019, for this project.",114,,
589,0.97,5135.93,5145.607,"We also pursued Federal EPA water infrastructure financing and innovation funding, for the project.",114,,
590,0.97,5145.673,5155.75,We are here today to talk about the $66 million loan and then one more next year for $28 million.,114,,
591,0.97,5155.817,5172.267,"Over our financing of 65% through the low interest loans, and overall saving our Ratepayers about $84 million . next slide.",114,,
592,0.97,5172.333,5175.303,I think that is it.,114,,
593,0.97,5175.37,5178.139,Any questions?,114,,
594,0.97,5178.206,5179.607,Excellent.,115,,
595,0.97,5179.674,5184.712,Thank you for the presentation.,116,,
596,0.97,5184.779,5200.929,"It is great to see all the departments taking advantage of the low interest rates and saving money for Ratepayers in this case, on this big project . Brian goodnight, any additional thoughts on this? I know we are voting today and Committee.",116,,
597,0.97,5200.995,5203.298,"No, no thank.",117,,

599,0.97,5206.501,5210.705,K. any questions?,118,,
600,0.97,5210.772,5213.141,Council member Herbold?,118,,
601,0.97,5213.207,5224.352,"My question project, I appreciate the opportunity to vote on this Legislature and realize the savings.",119,,
602,0.97,5224.419,5233.127,"But generally on the project, Keith, you mentioned the budget was set with the 65% confidence rate in 2018.",119,,
603,0.97,5233.194,5257.752,"And it sounded like when you were rightfully pointing out the good news that we are still at that same target for the cost of the project, I thought you said that we are still at 65% confidence rate, when will we go to even more confidence? [Laughter]",119,,
604,0.97,5257.819,5259.754,Good question.,120,,
605,0.97,5259.821,5262.624,That is always something I am focused on.,120,,
606,0.97,5262.69,5267.962,That is actually in the packet materials that we gave to Council but I am glad you mentioned that.,120,,
607,0.97,5268.029,5273.701,We have a $255 million contract with the contractor and have kind of transfer that portion over.,120,,
608,0.97,5273.768,5275.103,That is good news.,120,,
609,0.97,5275.169,5282.744,We still have two additional construction project that we will be bidding on the open market in 2022.,120,,
610,0.97,5282.81,5284.345,They are about $100 million between those two.,120,,
611,0.97,5284.412,5308.803,"So once we get bids on that, I mean, you know, I do want to say that most of this project is underground and there is always underground risks . But we have transferred some of those risks to our contractor so I am hoping that by about late fall 2022, we will have more cost certainty on the additional construction projects.",120,,
612,0.97,5308.87,5315.376,"And I expect, assuming Tunneling goes well, by then we should be finished with Tunneling, our confidence should go up.",120,,
613,0.97,5315.443,5315.977,Thank you.,121,,
614,0.97,5316.044,5316.411,Appreciate it.,121,,
615,0.97,5316.477,5317.211,Sure.,122,,

642,0.97,5415.943,5418.746,Thank you.,140,,
643,0.97,5418.813,5442.069,"Colleagues, we have come to the last item on the agenda, based on what we were just talking about with Seattle public utilities, Seattle city light, these are Massively publicly owned enterprises, and doing critical work for the city, providing clean water and electricity, the public Commenters are very excited about sound transit thing here at the Midi and this is the last item.",140,,
644,0.97,5442.136,5447.241,Let's have the clerk read the next title in the record.,140,,
645,0.97,5447.308,5456.617,"Presentation on sound transit realignment, for briefing and discussion.",141,,
646,0.97,5456.684,5502.196,"I am proud Inslee five from sound transit and also I would like to thanks Sam Zimbabwe and Sara Maxana from joining us, for the dental plans that it is calling the realignment process, the most vital transit agency for Seattle in the region, as we know the board of San transit is 18 members and while only two of them are from the city government, the Mayor and Council member Debora Juarez, our members in the region, I want to thank them for making this and I'm sure there are other presentations we will get from them.",142,,
647,0.97,5502.263,5509.704,We are excited here in the city about the opening this October about three new light rail stations in Seattle.,142,,
648,0.97,5509.77,5529.624,"Approved by the voters in 2008, the ambitious next step is the implementation of the St 3 expansion, approved in 2016. voters were instrumental in making possible the funding for St 3, we want to make sure that it delivers on its promises for Seattle.",142,,
649,0.97,5529.69,5556.25,"We had a lot of public Commenters focusing on this, this includes light rail stations in Seattle, port of Seattle, stations to Ballard which will impact Seattle center, additional stations for South Seattle, as well as the station at northeast 130Th Street and the massive connection for the entire region Impacting the International district.",142,,
650,0.97,5556.317,5569.83,"It is no surprise that I share the stance of many others in the city that we prefer the sound transit board to delay any drastic decisions on realignment of sound transit 3 project, until the rapidly changing picture of revenues becomes clear.",142,,
651,0.97,5569.897,5585.012,"I believe today we will have some questions that they have been relying on to make recommendations, and in addition to the presentation today, we hope that sound transit returns later this year to update us on the environmental impact statement process.",142,,
652,0.97,5585.079,5599.56,"There will be an appropriate platform for raising other issues important to us such as the need for thoughtful community driven Stakeholder input, to ensure excellent access to stations and integration into our communities.",142,,
653,0.97,5599.627,5613.04,"To deliver a positive experience for riders, as we encourage more people to move out of their gasoline fueled cars to carbon friendly transit, to meet our goals and address climate change.",142,,
654,0.97,5613.107,5616.677,"Ceo Jay Inslee five, welcome, and please introduce your team.",142,,
655,0.97,5616.744,5623.117,Thank you chair can I confirm that you can hear me okay?,143,,
656,0.97,5623.184,5626.62,Can anyone do a Thumbs-Up? great.,143,,
657,0.97,5626.687,5629.89,Thank you.,143,,
658,0.97,5629.957,5635.429,I do want to thank you for inviting sound transit to address you today.,143,,
659,0.97,5635.496,5647.875,"We really welcome this opportunity and have been doing realignment presentations two dozen of city and councils, important Stakeholder groups, throughout Somis, King, and Pierce counties.",143,,
660,0.97,5647.942,5655.816,"I did hear your interest in having us come again to discuss the EIS, we do welcome the opportunity.",143,,
661,0.97,5655.883,5658.919,And I heard you talk about wanting to have a discussion of station access.,143,,
662,0.97,5658.986,5677.772,"And when we do that, I hope you will include a position that I created at sound transit, including our officer that is really focused on these issues, Russ Arnold, who can come with a project staff and talk specifically about that.",143,,
663,0.97,5677.838,5709.336,"As was pointed out by one of the public witnesses, we are at a pivotal moment at Puget sound and know that millions of people have been Vaccinated and we can now finally see the other side of the pandemic . people are coming back to work . communities are coming back to transit and just this last weekend we increased service every eight minutes during weekday peak hours, 10 minutes Off-Peak and 15 minutes late at night, to recognize that not only were people are coming back but we want to invite more people back to transit.",143,,
664,0.97,5709.403,5711.972,The service needs to be reliable.,143,,
665,0.97,5712.039,5722.116,"So at the same time inflation is growing and cost for most goods, but most especially real estate and construction materials are continuing to rise.",143,,
666,0.97,5722.183,5747.074,"Through it all we really expected sound transit to continue to be a driving force in the economic recovery . It is important to remember that with voter approval, sound transit is currently planning and building the largest expansion program in the U.S. that includes the $54 billion St 3 that was approved by voters in 2016.",143,,
667,0.97,5747.141,5750.111,We are currently in the ground building eight major capital projects simultaneously.,143,,
668,0.97,5750.177,5756.55,Seven of the eight are honor under budget and all eight are on schedule.,143,,
669,0.97,5756.617,5795.623,"Ultimately over the next quarter-century we will build out 252 mile 16 with 116 miles of light rail system and 45 miles of bus route and transit . that will connect Seattle to Everett, Tacoma, Bellevue, Redmond, and West Seattle, Ballard, and will give citizens mobility options while simultaneously reducing greenhouse grasses--gases in a growing sustainable Union . However we have a shortfall in finances and it is clear we do not have the capacity to deliver the approved plan on the Timelines specified in the plan.",143,,
670,0.97,5795.689,5805.9,"Like many entities in the region, sound transit bases a combination of revenue loss because of the pandemic and substantial growth in estimated future project costs.",143,,
671,0.97,5805.966,5829.19,"Based on current forecasts and both revenues and cost to deliver the program, the agency has an estimated Affordability gap of $7.9 billion over the duration of the 25 year plan . Under the provisions of our measure, the sound transit board of directors is required to implement realigning, when it knows the program to be on afforded.",143,,
672,0.97,5829.256,5855.816,"The board has known the plan to be Unaffordable and working on the process now for 14 months . This is not, it is important to point out that this is not the first time the board has gone through the realignment process, similarly it was completed in 2010 when the great recession hit, soon after the approval of the St 2 ballot measure.",143,,
673,0.97,5855.883,5870.931,"This is the way that sound transit plays it straight with voters and taxpayers, the way the sound transit stays transparent with the commuters throughout the area and what expansions they can expect and when the services will be delivered.",143,,
674,0.97,5870.998,5880.241,"Importantly, realignment is the process through which we also demonstrate to our lenders and the bond market and the Federal Government that we are living Witin our means and worthy of their continued financial support.",143,,
675,0.97,5880.307,5895.356,Earlier you heard Debra Smith at City light talk about the rate agencies and obviously we too must make presentations to the rate agencies to approve our credit rating.,143,,
676,0.97,5895.422,5904.999,And we need a good story to tell because the positive credit rating will result in lower tax cost to residents of the region.,143,,
677,0.97,5905.065,5909.336,Also to allow the board to move forward on numerous project actions that are currently paused.,143,,
678,0.97,5909.403,5930.424,"Our board is currently in the process of squaring the financial capacity with the projects, while balancing the interest across the region to deliver the voter mandated regional transit network within the new economic realities . The board is simultaneously looking at new sources of revenue, including the Federal and state levels.",143,,
679,0.97,5930.491,5932.893,Also while looking at the Cost- saving opportunities.,143,,
680,0.97,5932.96,5941.902,"I know that you may have questions about the board realignment work, I wanted to say that we will do a little table setting before we get into that.",143,,
681,0.97,5941.969,5947.875,Today our team will provide a comprehensive Snapshot on the latest of sound transit's efforts in Seattle and across the region.,143,,
682,0.97,5947.941,5954.181,Our aim is to share when decisions are being made in the scope of the decisions.,143,,
683,0.97,5954.248,5965.326,Our executive director of management will preview new service openings and how we have progress throughout the project.,143,,
684,0.97,5965.392,5981.408,"And then don Billen, will discuss the recession impacts on our cost and the 2021 realignment process to adjust the project plans and schedules . and don Billen will also cover cost savings as we move forward.",143,,
685,0.97,5981.475,5986.347,Before I hand it to staff I want to comment on some general observations.,143,,
686,0.97,5986.413,6000.394,"Unfortunately I have to apologize in advance, I am going to have to do a hard stop at 11:45, we had a major announcement and Amazon regarding affordable housing today and I need to answer questions on that.",143,,
687,0.97,6000.461,6002.229,Staff will be able to stay beyond that.,143,,
688,0.97,6002.296,6010.037,But I did want to make a few comments and perhaps we can get into it in greater detail with questions and answers.,143,,
689,0.97,6010.104,6041.335,"Comments regarding some things you have heard Helically . I very much appreciate all of the public witnesses that came out earlier to discuss concerns and anxieties around the surrounding realignment process . The first observation I want to make is I think there is a lot of anxiety and concern that whatever the board does for the realignment process this summer, it is going to be as the board chair puts it, permanently carved in stone.",143,,
690,0.97,6041.402,6049.109,"In fact the resolution that we have been working with the board chair on drafting, is something very different . It is what we refer to as a flexible framework.",143,,
691,0.97,6049.176,6068.896,"The flexible framework is building into it an annual program review so the board can update and approve the plan based on new projections of revenues and costs, and perhaps Federal opportunities that may come through and in the structure plan, should it be adopted.",143,,
692,0.97,6068.962,6073.0,Secondly I her concern about station planning and engagement with the community.,143,,
693,0.97,6073.066,6131.024,"I want to ensure everyone that there is nothing about the realignment process that puts a stop to our engagement with the community on station planning . We fully intend to engage with everyone and all concerned Stakeholders as we do this . I think there may be some concern that the realignment plan, folks may suddenly wake up and discover the board eliminated a whole station . I will tell you and all the dozens of realignment scenarios that we have repaired at the board's request, none of them eliminate a major station . that really brings me to my third point, while there is some disagreement among the board members on precisely how the realignment process should proceed, every board member, every team that I have heard from in the last several months is fully committed to delivering the full plan . No one is interested in Segmenting off or throwing over the side any major investment that were adopted by the voters in 2016.",143,,
694,0.97,6131.091,6143.103,"In fact to the contrary, they are all very committed to delivering it as close as we possibly can.",143,,
695,0.97,6143.17,6161.255,"And forth, I will repeat something I said in my remarks, we want to move forward with the capital plan and realignment, for reasons we can explain, is why we believe allows the board to move forward on number of actions . that is how I think we continue to make progress through the board's actions in the coming months.",143,,
696,0.97,6161.321,6178.071,"With that I want to apologize again for having to leave in about a half hour's time . Mr. chairman, your invitation letter asked us to get through quite a bit of material, so please forgive the staff if they rifle through it past . But I know we want to get to Q & amp; a.",143,,
697,0.97,6178.138,6181.808,So with that I will hand it to Ron Lewis.,143,,
698,0.97,6181.875,6193.687,Thank you Ceo--this will be put on our a gender and was received late last night.,144,,
699,0.97,6193.754,6202.229,"I just saw it this morning for the first time, so we will circulate that and it will be posted on the agenda.",144,,
700,0.97,6202.296,6207.501,"I believe it is about 43 slides, so the largest portion is about realignment.",144,,
701,0.97,6207.568,6216.944,I encourage sound transit to focus in on the realignment discussion and to encourage Council members to ask questions during the presentation.,144,,

703,0.97,6222.349,6224.451,"There is a site called ""What is realignment?",144,,
704,0.97,6224.518,6255.816,"You can which I believe is slide 10 and will be key . because we do want to know what is baked in and what is not? and why not decide later in the fall when there is more security from Federal government sources and funding? I believe the $7.9 billion gap, while that is a very large number, relative to many budgets, you know that was a smaller number than what it was originally.",144,,
705,0.97,6255.882,6261.388,In fact it keeps shrinking as the outlook it's better.,144,,
706,0.97,6261.455,6276.436,"Questions of why not just wait a few more months until we have better Rvenue of cost estimates, and want to also ask about how independent, whether there is independent analysis to the cost, value engineering that has occurred, to trim the cost.",144,,
707,0.97,6276.503,6279.239,Thank you.,144,,

713,0.97,6309.336,6320.881,"Currently we have several major projects under construction, as the chair, as Ceo Rogoff noted . We have approximately $15 billion worth of investments in the three County region we serve.",145,,
714,0.97,6320.947,6351.678,"28 new stations will come Online by 2024, and pictured here, just to give you a sense of what is happening in the field, three of our light rail extensions, the systems work that is going on in the Eastlake project, elevated Guideway construction on the Federal way project, and then final preparations for major concrete pour in the Lynwood project over I-5 . This is an exciting time to be part of this expansion program.",145,,

716,0.97,6353.18,6385.245,"I want to focus just for a minute and highlight the Northgate project with the upcoming date of October 2ND . The Northgate project will bring in a line three new stations . The project is comprised of three to half miles of tunnel and approximately under one mile of elevated Guideway as we approach the Northgate station . When it opens we will provide 14 minute trips to downtown Seattle, and 47 minutes to the airport.",145,,
717,0.97,6385.312,6413.306,"I want to note that two notes of appreciation for the city participation, first, the partnership with Sam Zimbabwe and the S.Team, on the ridge that will enhance mobility for Bicyclists and pedestrians . and also recent work done by Seattle city, energizing the last power Substation, the Facilitation that is now underway.",145,,

723,0.97,6425.018,6430.824,"Just highlighting that for the next four years, you are opening nearly 10 stations per year.",147,,
724,0.97,6430.891,6435.395,I just wanted to highlight that as a success.,147,,
725,0.97,6435.462,6447.674,"As your momentum continues to build, we are going to see the benefits rather quickly, and it took us a while to get here and it is exciting to see this fine expansion.",147,,
726,0.97,6447.741,6463.156,"I do have a couple comments, to lead us off . I appreciate the chair inviting you here and I appreciate sound transit presenting to city council.",147,,
727,0.97,6463.223,6466.993,"Is hard for me, I do not believe this to be the most appropriate Venue for this discussion.",147,,
728,0.97,6467.06,6522.148,"We have many elected leaders throughout this region that need to be at the table for this conversation, because hitting--Pitting Seattle against Everett does not work . We need to make sure that we finish this all the way to Everett as soon as possible and at the same time ensure that 130Th Street station, which I testified before the sound transit board in January 2020, as benefits to District 6, the district that I represent in Seattle, we need to do both . and so this is my, I am saying this is not the most appropriate Venue because we need to have all the regional elected--around the table so that we can advocate and had conversations with each other . at this time I state that we restart the group or something similar to have conversations with each other, rather than in a vacuum.",147,,
729,0.97,6522.215,6526.086,With all that said I appreciate you being here today and I will have more questions as we continue.,147,,
730,0.97,6526.152,6526.653,Thank you.,148,,
731,0.97,6526.72,6537.397,"Let me continue here, with just a couple more slides in this portion of the presentation . I described what we were building and all the work that is under construction out within the region.",148,,
732,0.97,6537.464,6541.468,I want to spend just a moment on how we build it.,148,,
733,0.97,6541.534,6552.279,The what is important but how is also important and we are very proud of the diverse workforce that is building our infrastructure throughout the region.,148,,
734,0.97,6552.345,6564.19,"You see nearly 20,000 jobs to date, family wage jobs, supporting the construction . over 12 million labor hours, and importantly did empire city of the labor force that is building our projects.",148,,
735,0.97,6564.257,6579.873,"People of color performing nearly one third of the work between 2016 and 2020, and the last bullet is also important, women make up 7.5% of our workers, compared to the national average of 3% in the construction trades.",148,,
736,0.97,6579.94,6590.45,We are proud of the 7 1/2% but not stopping there as we are investing heavily in apprenticeship programs and training programs to encourage and help women become a larger part of our workforce.,148,,
737,0.97,6590.517,6596.99,"Next slide, please.",148,,
738,0.97,6597.057,6615.842,"And finally, my final slide, really reflecting our commitment to Sustainability . sound transit and the light rail, the first system in the nation that is 100% carbon free and we believe that is important in large part because of the contribution that transportation makes the greenhouse gases within our state.",148,,
739,0.97,6615.909,6619.045,"It is critically important that we be a leader in this effort, and we are.",148,,
740,0.97,6619.112,6636.629,"This is just a short Snapshot of how we are dealing with power progress at sound transit, completing current projects to make way for the next series of projects that Jay Inslee seven will address in the next portion of the presentation.",148,,
741,0.97,6636.696,6638.431,Thank you.,148,,
742,0.97,6638.498,6640.367,"Thank you, Ron.",149,,
743,0.97,6640.433,6645.705,And thank you are Pedersen and Council members for having us here this afternoon.,149,,
744,0.97,6645.772,6649.209,If we could go to the next slide.,149,,
745,0.97,6649.275,6652.245,"So, I want to start with what is realignment?",149,,
746,0.97,6652.312,6664.557,"Peter described this well in his opening remarks, this is really the sound transit board responding to an estimated Affordability gap in the program.",149,,
747,0.97,6664.624,6681.141,"By realigning our plan to balance cost in revenues . Council member Pedersen, you aptly describe the program as ""massive"" in fact St 3 is the largest program in the nation currently.",149,,
748,0.97,6681.207,6692.952,And all of the realignment plans that we are looking at will still deliver the full program with some potential adjustments in schedule and scope overtime.,149,,
749,0.97,6693.019,6705.098,"Options that the board has includes modifying scope to reduce cost, raising new revenues, and/or delaying or facing projects.",149,,
750,0.97,6705.165,6708.635,Next slide.,149,,
751,0.97,6708.701,6710.703,We have a question Council member Herbold.,150,,
752,0.97,6710.77,6711.938,Thank you so much.,151,,
753,0.97,6712.005,6720.113,"I was kind of zoning in on the language, in the text, in orange.",151,,
754,0.97,6720.18,6722.816,A required response to estimated shortfalls.,151,,
755,0.97,6722.882,6765.158,"And I do not think that there is a question of whether or not there needs to be a response . But there are, I believe, a lot of questions about the timing of these decisions, and so this slide seems to me to imply that more action is needed right now . and I am hearing a lot of good arguments for waiting until we have a copy, a final version of the draft EIS for West Seattle Ballard, which will be published this year.",151,,
756,0.97,6765.225,6774.167,Just really want to understand what the rationale is for making a decision on realignment before the public has even had a chance to review the draft EIS.,151,,
757,0.97,6774.234,6787.947,"Further, need to understand why we must make a decision, why you must make a decision before there is clarity on how much Federal funding will be available.",151,,
758,0.97,6788.014,6803.696,"You know that there are updates that we are all receiving on potential approaches for Federal infrastructure, packages nearly every week . I think this is a really critical factor to any decision that is part of consideration of realignment.",151,,
759,0.97,6803.763,6815.608,Why don't I take a answering that and then Jay Inslee seven and others can take a run.,152,,
760,0.97,6815.675,6825.418,"You are right that while the process of realignment is required under the ballot measure, the ballot measure is not setting an absolute Timeline or deadline for which it must occur.",152,,
761,0.97,6825.485,6833.193,There are a number of programmatic and policy reasons why the board chair feels that it should be concluded this summer.,152,,
762,0.97,6833.259,6854.948,"And I will just name a few, as I said earlier, the board has been at this for some 14 months . and there are, I think this comes at a later slide, or certainly information that we can provide, $2.4 billion in actions that we are able to take in the coming year.",152,,
763,0.97,6855.014,6865.825,"What we refer to as major baseline actions, which is to say we would go forward, baseline, set the schedule and scope of the project and put it out for bid.",152,,
764,0.97,6865.892,6902.962,"It is going to be extraordinarily difficult, as it already has been, even prior to this, to get the board to move forward on major actions . especially major actions in other people's regions of the districts or other sub areas . without knowing if and when the project will be delivered in any reasonable Timeframe . So the board chair believes strongly that in order to be able to coalesce the board without moving capital program forward, the board members are going to need to know with some level of comfort and transparency and clarity, when the projects can and will be affordable.",152,,
765,0.97,6903.029,6926.552,"Now the board is required, this is a requirement, it is required to be adopted every year both in state law and required submission to the Federal transit and Ministration, to annually produce what we call a tip, the transportation improvement plan . It lays out what amounts of money we will spend and on what projects over the next six years.",152,,
766,0.97,6926.619,6935.561,At the end of last year the board adopted a T.I.P.,152,,
767,0.97,6935.628,6941.134,"That was a Placeholder that said every project will be delayed five years, making the project affordable in the moment.",152,,
768,0.97,6941.2,6952.612,"I think what you will see when don Billen comes forward with some scenarios that the board is considering, it is not necessary for all the major projects to be delayed five years.",152,,
769,0.97,6952.679,6958.785,"In fact, some of them may only need to be delayed a year or two.",152,,
770,0.97,6958.851,6995.121,"A lot of that corresponds not necessarily with financial delays but delays associated with the fact that it has taken them longer during Covid to get environmental documents clear to the Federal resource agencies, the FTA, to get the level of engagement that we need to produce the documents . So we can do a lot better than delaying everything for five years, and I think that is why if we adopt the realignment plan this summer, the staff can then bring a transportation improvement plan to the board in the fall, along with budget for 2022.",152,,
771,0.97,6995.188,6997.957,That will align with the realigned plan.,152,,
772,0.97,6998.024,7006.065,"And you know, the board chair's view, that is how we make progress in the thinking behind the timing.",152,,
773,0.97,7006.132,7010.269,Thank you Peter.,153,,
774,0.97,7010.336,7057.283,"And I would add in terms of the relationship to the West Seattle and Ballard environmental process, there has always been a distinction between System-Level planning and project level planning . The original St 3 plan, established a system plan for the build out to West Seattle and Ballard, first to West Seattle in 2030, then Ballard in 2035, left details about project level planning precise station locations, as an example, to the project and nothing in this realignment process presupposes any outcome of those project level decisions that are yet to come . If we could go to the next slide.",153,,
775,0.97,7057.35,7061.621,So what is included in realignment?,153,,
776,0.97,7061.687,7071.631,"Projects that are currently under construction, the projects that Ron Lewis just overview for you, are not included in the realignment process.",153,,
777,0.97,7071.697,7076.969,"Projects in planning or that have not yet started planning, are affected.",153,,
778,0.97,7077.036,7095.621,"I would also note that in some cases the board has authorized very imitate construction on portions of projects, that limited construction is not affected at the completion of the projects are included in the realignment plans.",153,,
779,0.97,7095.688,7103.296,And that includes both our bus rapid transit projects and the 1/30 station.,153,,
780,0.97,7103.362,7112.405,"So why is northeast Street included, if it is already under construction?",154,,
781,0.97,7112.472,7117.109,That is an board has authorized only very limited construction.,155,,
782,0.97,7117.176,7153.846,"So the St 3 plan assumed that the northeast 1/30 station would be completed in 2031, last year the board authorized completing design on the station and doing some very limited construction work, to reduce the future disruption, that would otherwise occur when the station is completed . They did not make a decision however to accelerate full completion or full construction of the station.",155,,
783,0.97,7153.913,7162.855,"So that question of when the station is fully built out, remains before the board of directors.",155,,
784,0.97,7162.922,7172.198,"Okay, and I know member Juarez is the board member actively engaged in that and Council member Strauss?",156,,
785,0.97,7172.265,7174.066,"Thank you, chair.",157,,
786,0.97,7174.133,7185.311,"As well as Council member Juarez, I am also interested the station at 1/30, because it does serve district 6, as I mentioned before.",157,,
787,0.97,7185.378,7188.214,I wanted to ask a couple questions.,157,,
788,0.97,7188.281,7201.561,"The original cost estimate for the five project, estimated between 65 and 67 million . As of April 2021, the project is estimated to cost 311 million.",157,,
789,0.97,7201.627,7218.945,"So over the last five year project it has cost fivefold, this is significantly higher than predicted by some transit models and updates further review, can you help me understand why it is so high.",157,,
790,0.97,7219.011,7221.681,Well let me and then let staff answer the question.,158,,
791,0.97,7221.747,7226.419,"Respectfully, council member, I think you are doing an apple to orange comparison.",158,,
792,0.97,7226.485,7258.084,"There is no question that the northeast five station, along with the cost estimates, that have undergone, the cost Grote and significant cost growth . I think the numbers you are citing include an expenditure number but staff can make what the real numbers are clear, and answer your question as far as the cost.",158,,
793,0.97,7258.15,7258.684,Thank you.,159,,
794,0.97,7258.751,7264.957,"I think what you said helps me as my question again, does the update warrant further review?",159,,
795,0.97,7265.024,7270.83,"I could just add a bit more to that response, council member.",160,,
796,0.97,7270.896,7279.705,"Peter is correct, it is a little bit apples and oranges, with regard to the dollar that we are talking about with escalation.",160,,
797,0.97,7279.772,7304.163,"But even adjusting for putting all of the dollars in 20 $20, there was a significant increase in the cost of the station . So in 2020 dollars the comparison would be $79 million, in St 3, 130 million for design, and 210 million at design, so it is delay significant increase.",160,,
798,0.97,7304.23,7308.901,And I will just get the quick highlights of what contributed to that.,160,,
799,0.97,7308.968,7348.007,"Then I will note, as you noted, we have been briefing board member Juarez, providing her a more detailed presentation and happy to send that over to the Council at your discretion . The items that attributed to the cost, these are items that we are reviewing in light of the overall cost methodology, with a consultant that we brought on to help us look at that process . One thing we have noted is the lack of detail design, at the point where the St 3 estimates were put together.",160,,
800,0.97,7348.074,7356.749,"There were some fairly major components which were not well defined in the station, which led to early estimates being low.",160,,
801,0.97,7356.816,7384.243,"We also underestimated the true challenges and difficulties associated with constructing around an operating service . and as we updated the estimates, we are now taking into account what the actual impacts on construction would be from operating, from having an operating light rail system, as we are doing some of that construction.",160,,
802,0.97,7384.31,7392.284,"That results in doing more work off-hours, or more overtime and other challenges working around the light rail.",160,,
803,0.97,7392.351,7402.294,"The third item, some additional right away improvements that were identified in collaboration with our project partners, city of Seattle and watch ..",160,,
804,0.97,7402.361,7416.108,"Also estimates related to labor, supply shortages and costs, as we spoke with the initial presentation.",160,,
805,0.97,7416.175,7432.925,There were a number of issues and we are happy to provide the same detailed information to board member Juarez and the balance of the committee members.,160,,
806,0.97,7432.992,7433.425,Thank you.,160,,
807,0.97,7433.492,7433.826,Thank you.,161,,
808,0.97,7433.893,7437.963,I would love to see that presentation and would love to meet with you outside of the committee.,161,,
809,0.97,7438.03,7443.869,"My last question is, is the concurrent opening date still on the table and why or why not?",161,,
810,0.97,7443.936,7459.819,"Know it is constructing, the best case scenario, for constructing the Linwood station, would be going back to the board this fall, for consideration of the next phase of construction.",162,,
811,0.97,7459.885,7485.611,"And then back in the first quarter of 2022, once the design is completed, and we have final pricing for board consideration, if the board were to choose to move forward with that, it would still mean that the 130Th station would still be complete, the year following the Lynnwood link, in 2024.",162,,
812,0.97,7485.678,7530.289,"That is hard news just registering my hope that we do not have a ghost station for 20 years, as we know that Ridership in that area, if we are to put all riders at 1/44, and Northgate, it will not only jam those stations but also reduces the ability to build affordable housing in and around stations, 130Th in particular . why this might sound like a Pie- In-The-Sky idea, we are Stuttering how we live and there is a ripe opportunity to see Aj Choker with both private and public investments.",163,,
813,0.97,7530.356,7533.659,I guess I am very Disheartened to hear,163,,
814,0.97,7595.054,7598.991,You know an open concurrently.,164,,
815,0.97,7599.058,7602.895,"I am happy to take the conversation off-line, in the interest of time.",164,,
816,0.97,7602.962,7603.529,Thank you.,164,,
817,0.97,7603.595,7607.366,Council member,165,,
818,0.97,7607.433,7608.334,Thank you.,166,,
819,0.97,7608.4,7613.572,"I have questions about two stations, grant Street and Jackson.",166,,
820,0.97,7613.639,7626.452,"But before I do that, and before the director has to go, before you leave, I want to reiterate what we are all hearing from our constituents.",166,,
821,0.97,7626.518,7636.095,Which is that we need to keep neighborhood voices off the table and there is a request to hear more regularly from sound transit.,166,,
822,0.97,7636.161,7640.566,I appreciate the hair inviting you here.,166,,
823,0.97,7640.632,7651.143,"I know this is not a new message, and sound transit has been doing work on engagement practices and community engagement in your work is critical.",166,,
824,0.97,7651.21,7661.42,And I just want to make sure there is an understanding that you are accountable to the community that you work in . You know sound transit is not just about laying track through a neighborhood.,166,,
825,0.97,7661.487,7671.397,"There are people there in those neighborhoods, communities that are surrounding the rail and permanently impacted by the work that goes in.",166,,
826,0.97,7671.463,7677.036,So I look forward to continuing to talk to you and hear regularly.,166,,
827,0.97,7677.102,7689.415,"I would like to hear specifically about the grant Street station, which I know is on a completed line, that is different from the situation at 130Th.",166,,
828,0.97,7689.481,7717.776,"Would like to hear more about why the station opening is being pushed back so far . and I would like to hear more about whether there is plan and design, where in the design process it is, and I would also like to hear about the Jackson Street Hub, and where in the design process that is, that is my understanding at the beginning of last year, only at 5% or 6% design.",166,,
829,0.97,7717.843,7720.279,I would like to hear more about the progress there.,166,,
830,0.97,7720.345,7740.666,"Let me answer of that then I will ask don and Ron to fill in the blanks . First, we wholeheartedly agree and thank you for recognizing our improved efforts to engage the community on all parts of our process.",167,,
831,0.97,7740.732,7747.94,"It is not really just planning for new projects but how well our service is serving the community now, including the existing service.",167,,
832,0.97,7748.006,7770.362,"I spoke earlier about hiring our chief executive officer, working increasingly more with our new director, in terms of how we engage communities, especially Bipoc communities . not just in looking at our future but looking at our present.",167,,
833,0.97,7770.429,7811.503,"And this is one area where I think we have upped our game, we have improvements yet to make, and we are also an agency that recognizes that you made the comment about we needing to do more than just lay track . I think we recognize that . When the initial segment of light rail was built, there was a lot of pressure on the agency to get track in the ground . Some of the community impacts were not investigated enough . So we are not looking just at again, our future States but also looking at the current state and seeing where we can approve on that.",167,,
834,0.97,7811.57,7840.165,"And with that, Ron and don can provide information specifically on the status . I do know that if you have the assumption on the length of delay, similar to what Council member Strauss said about 130Th, I think it is important to highlight these various measures of delay are just proposals currently before the the board, that have not been acted on.",167,,
835,0.97,7840.232,7844.703,So as we said nothing is cast in stone.,167,,
836,0.97,7844.77,7855.247,"And even when the board acts, the board has said rather unanimously, whatever they do they plan to as a group of 18, aggressively work to improve on it.",167,,
837,0.97,7855.314,7859.585,"So with that, maybe don and Ron can correct some detail.",167,,
838,0.97,7859.651,7859.851,Sure.,168,,
839,0.97,7859.918,7865.958,"In the St 3 plan, the grant Street station was scheduled for 2031.",168,,
840,0.97,7866.024,7875.334,So that plan we would design work in approximately 2024. so we are a few years out from that.,168,,
841,0.97,7875.4,7888.88,"If I could request that you let me get through a little bit more of the presentation, then we can talk about how the realignment process is treating that and other stations.",168,,
842,0.97,7888.947,7909.034,"And then our project director for the West Seattle and Ballard project, Cathal ridge, at the end of the project, can give you much more detail on the Jackson Street Hub process . If that is all right with you . Thank you.",168,,
843,0.97,7909.101,7911.103,"Let's, Yeah, here we go.",168,,
844,0.97,7911.169,7949.074,"Financial changes, as Peter indicated, the total estimated Affordability gap is currently $7.9 billion . and that is made up of a combination of projected revenue declines over the 25 year plan of 1.5 billion, and a net increase and cost of 6.4 billion, for some of the reasons Peter described, estimated project costs have grown, been partially offset by grants and debt capacity but another 6.4 billion still to address.",168,,
845,0.97,7949.141,7962.988,"Leaving the Affordability gap of 7.9 billion, that we are tackling through the realignment process in order to be able to then move forward with our project planning and delivery work.",168,,
846,0.97,7963.055,7966.692,Next slide.,168,,
847,0.97,7966.758,7985.477,"So in terms of the realignment Timeline, the board really began this conversation last April, the chair is targeting next month for potential action that will then in turn inform our annual budget and tip process in December.",168,,
848,0.97,7985.544,7990.816,Next slide.,168,,
849,0.97,7990.882,8001.059,So the way that we tackle the Affordability gap is by analyzing different scenarios for Reprogramming our expansion plans.,168,,
850,0.97,8001.126,8029.454,"And the board really started this conversation last spring, with a conversation about what criteria might guide their work . They conducted a workshop in June and at the end of June, adopted eight criteria, including Ridership, equity, connecting centers, and other criteria that informed their work.",168,,
851,0.97,8029.521,8038.029,"At the end of the year we published evaluation results, using the criteria and the board held a workshop in January to go through the results.",168,,
852,0.97,8038.096,8044.569,February and March we developed illustrative scenarios that built on those criteria.,168,,
853,0.97,8044.636,8070.262,"And then have led to discussion around to what we referred to as--scenarios that perform well against multiple criteria, that integrate with King County Metro and the Washington State Department of transportation . and also account for agency partnerships account for Subarea equity.",168,,
854,0.97,8070.328,8073.932,Next slide.,168,,
855,0.97,8073.999,8079.438,Something that is integral to every area that we have looked at is potentially phasing projects.,168,,
856,0.97,8079.504,8086.978,"By building a first affordable segment, and then looking at completing the project, in future phases.",168,,
857,0.97,8087.045,8122.013,"This is a common approach, really around the country, around the world, frankly . sound transit has used it before, our project started with light rail between downtown Seattle and--and then expanded Incrementally over time, with the next increment coming in October as Ron decided--described coming to Northgate, followed by Redmond.",168,,
858,0.97,8122.08,8136.995,"Other project features, we are in an active conversation about what is sound transit's role in supporting drive access to our stations and may consider deferring some part capacity to later phases.",168,,
859,0.97,8137.062,8139.631,Next slide.,168,,
860,0.97,8139.698,8145.737,I just want to walk through a few examples of things.,168,,
861,0.97,8145.804,8159.718,"The transit program, St 3, and the I-405, and the corridor, the St 3 plan envisioning opening all of those services on the same day.",168,,
862,0.97,8159.784,8170.395,"It would be possible to phase the services, and to, they are three separate operating lines, so each line can operate in a different date.",168,,
863,0.97,8170.462,8171.963,Next slide.,168,,
864,0.97,8172.03,8186.745,"To the North, St 3 envisioned light rail extension between Winwood and Everett, opening at one segment, we are evaluating a potential--at the mariner park exit.",168,,
865,0.97,8186.811,8188.38,Next slide.,168,,
866,0.97,8188.446,8200.058,"To the South, extending from Federal way to the Tacoma Dome, next slide.",168,,
867,0.97,8200.125,8212.571,"West Seattle and Ballard, the St 3 plan, called for light rail to go from Soto, to West Seattle, in 2030 and then be extended North to Ballard in 2035.",168,,
868,0.97,8212.637,8218.109,"So in that scenario, Soto is the interim in termini.",168,,
869,0.97,8218.176,8223.815,"We are also looking at Dell ridge, Denny and Smith Cove as potential termini.",168,,
870,0.97,8223.882,8226.551,I will speak to that more in just a moment.,168,,
871,0.97,8226.618,8228.153,Next slide.,168,,
872,0.97,8228.219,8241.266,"So all of these scenarios are utilizing schedule as a way to spread our cost over time, in order to keep the program affordable.",168,,
873,0.97,8241.333,8246.004,But importantly they also filled in keeping the plan shovel ready.,168,,
874,0.97,8246.071,8261.286,"So each project, depending upon the tier it is placed on and the estimated years of delay, would continue with work that enables that project to be accelerated.",168,,
875,0.97,8261.353,8291.95,"Nearly every tier would include, as an example, completing environmental review, and preliminary design and Limitary strategic acquisition . This will enable us to be flexible so that if financial circumstances improve, whether that be by reducing cost or new funding opportunities, that the board retains the option of accelerating some projects from the realignment dates.",168,,
876,0.97,8292.017,8296.855,Next slide.,168,,
877,0.97,8296.921,8302.16,I want to very quickly walk you through three scenarios that the board is currently reviewing.,168,,
878,0.97,8302.227,8317.308,"All of the scenarios include system components, bus basis, operations and maintenance facilities for light rail and a second tunnel through downtown Seattle that are essential for system operations.",168,,
879,0.97,8317.375,8332.49,"In the North, every scenario considers the entrance terminus at mariner for that extension and the Eastside looks at different ways to phase the PRT program.",168,,
880,0.97,8332.557,8346.838,In the central core door this particular scenario would Prioritize funding of the Dell ridge to Smith Cove portion of the project.,168,,
881,0.97,8346.905,8357.282,"For operational reasons it would open between Seattle and Sodo in 2035, then go to Ballard in 2040.",168,,
882,0.97,8357.348,8369.094,Graham Street would be in tier 2 in this scenario and the 1/30--130Th station in tier 4. next slide.,168,,
883,0.97,8369.16,8375.533,"Scenario two, the central corridor, taking a different approach.",168,,
884,0.97,8375.6,8385.744,"Trying to provide direct service from the West Seattle area into downtown Seattle sooner, with that Delridge to Denny segment in 2035.",168,,
885,0.97,8385.81,8392.317,And extension out to the West Seattle junction in 2038 and then Ballard in 2041.,168,,
886,0.97,8392.384,8402.594,"In this scenario both stations would be in tier 4, with the projected 2041 completion date . next slide.",168,,
887,0.97,8402.66,8414.606,"Finally scenario three, following most closely the original St 3 sequencing, going between Sodo and the Alaska junction, in 2032.",168,,
888,0.97,8414.672,8424.315,"And then building a tunnel through downtown Seattle, out to Smith Cove in 2038, then on to Ballard in 2040.",168,,
889,0.97,8424.382,8433.725,"In this case both stations are in tier 2, with estimated completion dates of 2037. next slide.",168,,
890,0.97,8433.792,8435.493,Excuse me.,169,,
891,0.97,8435.56,8438.596,Council member Strauss?,169,,
892,0.97,8438.663,8442.233,Thank you chair.,170,,
893,0.97,8442.3,8446.771,"Thank you again don, for the presentation.",170,,
894,0.97,8446.838,8455.113,"I guess just in the slides, can you help me understand what Federal funding is already assumed in the math and what additional Federal funding can be obtained?",170,,
895,0.97,8455.18,8456.381,Yes.,171,,
896,0.97,8456.447,8482.674,"So the beginning of the year, the agency updated the Federal funding projections, and currently the St 3 plan assumes that the capital expansion program would receive about 17.7% of the total program would be underwritten by the Federal Government.",171,,
897,0.97,8482.74,8495.153,"We are of course actively engaged under Peter's leadership, with discussions at the Federal level, about opportunities to increase that share.",171,,
898,0.97,8495.22,8500.325,But it will be many years before we have certainty about what the overall Federal share might be.,171,,
899,0.97,8500.391,8501.96,Thank you.,172,,
900,0.97,8502.026,8503.728,That is helpful.,172,,
901,0.97,8503.795,8511.369,My next question leads me to this slide and then if we could circle back to slide 19.,172,,
902,0.97,8511.436,8517.942,"I guess with making the decisions to delay, when the math is still uncertain, seems like a bad idea to me.",172,,
903,0.97,8518.009,8522.68,Can you help me understand what the right time to delay would be?,172,,
904,0.97,8522.747,8534.425,"You know for the that Peter described, we are working under the chair's direction towards a July action on realignment.",173,,
905,0.97,8534.492,8551.009,"And one of the reasons it would be so helpful to have clarity on the realignment framework in the near term, is that we have about $2.5 billion worth of projects that are through environmental review.",173,,
906,0.97,8551.075,8574.365,"And we cannot advance those programs into design and construction, until we Rebalance the overall program or the board goes through a very challenging project process of looking at how each individual project would affect future decisions.",173,,
907,0.97,8574.432,8592.917,"And those include whether to advance further, on the 130Th construction, the bus rapid transit program, along the North edge of Seattle, and then sounder investments in South King and Pierce County.",173,,
908,0.97,8592.984,8594.152,Okay.,174,,
909,0.97,8594.218,8596.654,Thank you.,174,,
910,0.97,8596.721,8605.196,"I guess I will just still say that making decisions to delay when there is such an certainty, it does not seem like a good idea to me.",174,,
911,0.97,8605.263,8616.741,"But if you could go back to slide 19, I guess that my question here is what is phasing look like from the usability perspective, rather than the cash flow?",174,,
912,0.97,8616.808,8623.881,"It also seems to me that Delridge to Smith Cove, does not serve the city from a usability framework.",174,,
913,0.97,8623.948,8636.16,"I will make one comment, and then my last question, I heard from the public testimony today that building the station at Ballard West of 15th was called out today.",174,,
914,0.97,8636.227,8650.508,"That is a position I support . In my last question, West Seattle has been seeming to go before Ballard and it seems like Ballard could go before West Seattle but why not do these concurrently?",174,,
915,0.97,8650.575,8657.281,"So the two questions that I wanted to circle around, what is phasing look like from the usability perspective rather than cash flow?",174,,
916,0.97,8657.348,8661.119,Can we do Ballard and West Seattle concurrently?,174,,
917,0.97,8661.185,8665.623,Rather than one before the other.,174,,
918,0.97,8665.69,8666.057,Okay.,175,,
919,0.97,8666.124,8668.96,Let me start with the usability question.,175,,
920,0.97,8669.027,8677.168,"I mean whether a station is interim or long-term termini, there are similar considerations.",175,,
921,0.97,8677.235,8701.392,"Any station that is the end of the line is likely to have higher Ridership demand and so we look very closely at how we design the station to accommodate the Ridership demand, and what we need to do in terms of ensuring good bus integration . At interim termini stations.",175,,
922,0.97,8701.459,8712.87,"So Cahill and his project team are in fact at each of these locations, in conversations with King County Metro and S.D.O.T.",175,,
923,0.97,8712.937,8733.624,"About how with the stations function, as potential termini locations, to ensure that there is good bus access, good walk access, good bike access and that we designed the station to accommodate what the Ridership demand might be.",175,,
924,0.97,8733.691,8737.328,"Can you repeat your second question, council member?",175,,
925,0.97,8737.395,8744.135,"Yes, I appreciate the next question is, can we do battle and West Seattle concurrently?",176,,
926,0.97,8744.202,8746.971,Rather than one before the other.,176,,
927,0.97,8747.038,8747.205,Yes.,177,,
928,0.97,8747.271,8749.841,Thank you for the reminder.,177,,
929,0.97,8749.907,8756.38,I know they both the downtown transit tunnel . which is the largest.,178,,
930,0.97,8756.447,8756.781,Yes.,179,,
931,0.97,8756.848,8769.694,"The tunnel is precisely why in the original St 3 plan, that West Seattle was proposed to open ahead of the Ballard extension.",179,,
932,0.97,8769.76,8780.705,Is just a reality that the construction duration for that Tunneling is going to be longer than for the extension to West Seattle.,179,,
933,0.97,8780.771,8791.482,So there will be in fact concurrent work occurring just as both are being evaluated simultaneously through the environmental process.,179,,
934,0.97,8791.549,8810.568,"It is quite likely you will see concurrent construction, we need to face the opening dates to match when enough construction can make it complete to actually provide Revenue service.",179,,
935,0.97,8810.635,8810.968,Okay.,180,,
936,0.97,8811.035,8812.803,I look forward to talking to do more.,180,,
937,0.97,8812.87,8816.04,I see Council member Herbold also has a question.,180,,
938,0.97,8816.107,8818.509,I am waiting with anticipation to hear what she has to ask.,180,,
939,0.97,8818.576,8821.646,"Council member,",181,,
940,0.97,8821.712,8822.213,Thanks.,182,,
941,0.97,8822.28,8826.751,"It is not all that exciting, council member Strauss.",182,,
942,0.97,8826.817,8836.227,"[Laughter] questions on three of the slides, scenarios, specific questions, then general questions about all scenarios.",182,,
943,0.97,8836.294,8862.119,"Moving first to slide 21. scenario 1, at the bottom of the slide it says that the Delridge station opens with the tier 2 to the Alaska junction, I need to know what that means . is there a station that Delridge not been used for several years?",182,,
944,0.97,8862.186,8888.446,"And just flagging, that that is indeed the case, that is going to create a live of stress on the residents of the Youngstown neighborhood, with impacts possibly, if I say this correctly, occurring at different times, rather than all at once.",182,,
945,0.97,8888.512,8924.148,"Slide 22, my question is, whether or not, we often hear under scenario 2, Entailing a station in Delridge, in 2035. and Lastly, slide 3, I wanted to just confirm that I am understanding this correctly . that in six years, there would be a line from West Seattle, to Sodo.",182,,
946,0.97,8924.215,8944.935,"I am thinking about the capacity that if riders have to wait, that it would hinder the successive hold system pump, and needs integration and cooperation amongst transit, Metro, and S.D.O.T ..",182,,
947,0.97,8955.846,8971.629,"Yes, in this would first have rail operation between the junction and Sodo . and then six years later, complete the extension, out to Smith Cove, including the second downtown tunnel.",183,,
948,0.97,8971.696,8980.037,"So there is a six-year period where riders from West Seattle, would transfer at Sodo, on two other trains.",183,,
949,0.97,8980.104,8987.645,"That is similar to the original St 3 plan, that had about a five year period where the transfer would occur.",183,,
950,0.97,8987.712,8995.386,"And we are in all the work looking closely at not just the individual projects, but the whole system.",183,,
951,0.97,8995.453,9016.774,"So we will have to, in 2032, in this scenario, we also extend the light rail to Tacoma . and we would have to establish headway and train links on that to Tacoma service, sufficient to accommodate the transfers from West Seattle.",183,,
952,0.97,9016.841,9025.015,"If we go back one side to scenario 2, in this scenario, Delridge to Denny, would be complete.",183,,
953,0.97,9025.082,9043.167,"We have Segmentation in place, which is our technical term that enables trains from West Seattle and in this case Delridge, to operate through downtown Seattle, and actually North to Lynnwood.",183,,
954,0.97,9043.234,9052.443,"And then three years later, would extend from Delridge, out to the junction.",183,,
955,0.97,9052.51,9060.584,There would be a three year period in which the Delridge station would be an interim terminus station.,183,,
956,0.97,9060.651,9079.103,"And then if we go to the prior slide, this is where Maybe we have not done the best job, of communicating this scenario . We would not complete the Delridge station, and have it sit Unutilized for a multi-year period.",183,,
957,0.97,9079.17,9092.45,"Practically speaking what this scenario would meet, is that in 2035, you would run trains from the junction, DeSoto, and then we would phase out to support that.",183,,
958,0.97,9092.516,9119.443,"Five years later we would, I am sorry, two years later extend to Smith Cove and then three years after that to Ballard . So in this scenario, council member, there is a two year period between 2035, and 2037, where West Seattle riders would transfer.",183,,
959,0.97,9119.51,9127.051,Thank you very much.,184,,
960,0.97,9127.117,9133.457,Did not want to give any of my friends in Youngstown a scare . [Laughter] by asking that question.,184,,
961,0.97,9133.524,9140.331,"And with the chair's cooperation here, one follow-up question as it relates to all scenarios really.",184,,
962,0.97,9140.397,9140.965,Yes.,185,,
963,0.97,9141.031,9141.832,Of course.,185,,
964,0.97,9141.899,9146.637,Thank you.,186,,
965,0.97,9146.704,9159.149,"So for all of if realignment is taken by the board, with all of the options approved by the board for the West Seattle and Ballard lines, be included in the draft EIS has planned?",187,,
966,0.97,9159.216,9167.324,"Asked a different way, could ward action on realignment limit what is published in the draft EIS?",187,,
967,0.97,9167.391,9175.733,And would board action on realignment result in any additions to the draft EIS?,187,,
968,0.97,9175.799,9182.506,I am not of realignment that would limit what is published in the draft EIS.,188,,
969,0.97,9182.573,9202.693,"The only potential addition is if in fact the board ADOPTS the realignment scenario, in which Denny is the interim termini . We would then need to add evaluation of the aft to the draft EIS.",188,,
970,0.97,9202.76,9237.461,"And I also want to emphasize that in all scenarios, West Seattle and Ballard, is completed within tier 2, and so the proposed work plan is not only to finish the environmental process, but also to advance the full core door in final design, and then begin right away acquisition, in order to try and contain the type of real estate pricing increases that we have seen on that project.",188,,
971,0.97,9237.528,9244.535,Thank you.,189,,
972,0.97,9244.602,9271.829,"So I think I I will wrap this up really quick if we go to slide 24. Council member Morales, and I know the full counselor, very interested in engagement . and we have been doing intensive outreach, including a focus on equitable engagement over the last year, in particularly in the spring time frame.",190,,
973,0.97,9271.895,9284.108,"And we have a lot more information about that work that we can share with Council members, if you are interested . next slide.",190,,
974,0.97,9284.174,9308.298,"So next steps, we are anticipating that board chair Kiel, at the June meeting, will propose a draft realignment action and then the board, during the month of July, will consider whether they are ready to take action and adopt a realignment framework.",190,,
975,0.97,9308.365,9321.378,"With, you know, built-in annual program reviews, to continue to monitor financial conditions and adjust as the conditions change.",190,,
976,0.97,9321.445,9325.849,Into that point I just want to say a few words about our Cost- saving work.,190,,
977,0.97,9325.916,9328.218,Next slide.,190,,
978,0.97,9328.285,9347.604,"So when we saw the significant increases in the estimated cost in the number of the St 3 projects, we made a decision to bring in an independent third- party reviewer, to review the estimates, a consulting firm by the name of Tri-Unity.",190,,
979,0.97,9347.671,9369.126,"They confirmed the estimates are appropriate for current level of design and the board elected to continue to engage Tri-Unity to help assist with capital Cost-Saving work, that we will also be undertaking . next slide.",190,,
980,0.97,9369.193,9379.57,And there is really three categories to list cost admitting work.,190,,
981,0.97,9379.636,9400.257,"One, looking at cost estimates, looking at controls, and three, looking at capital cost savings . and that will be ongoing and tied to specific project schedules, so in the case of the West Seattle and Ballard projects, that is work that Cahill Ridge will meet.",190,,
982,0.97,9400.324,9407.131,"This concludes the realignment section of the presentation, council member Pedersen.",190,,
983,0.97,9407.197,9418.242,"We do have Cahill here, if you want to update the West Seattle project.",190,,
984,0.97,9418.308,9422.146,"We have an update Council member Herbold, and we are coming up against time here.",191,,
985,0.97,9422.212,9424.381,We would like to welcome you back to our committee.,191,,
986,0.97,9424.448,9439.129,"I know one thing we will want to talk about are the design elements, and the outreach, and the access and the integration of the stations, to plan that very early.",191,,
987,0.97,9439.196,9469.393,"Because I know with the stations that are opening this October, we are excited about it, and we know what a long lead time is required, to have input on stations like that . So we want to invite the office of planning and community development, our design Commission, when we talk about the actual stations themselves . But we have questions right now from Council member Herbold and morale is.",191,,
988,0.97,9469.459,9471.728,Go ahead.,191,,
989,0.97,9471.795,9479.87,"Well on the cost Workplan, I recall that we received a presentation a while back.",192,,
990,0.97,9479.937,9494.751,"A presentation around the West Seattle line tunnel and that the presentation showed the Delta between a tunnel and an elevated line, was actually decreasing.",192,,
991,0.97,9494.818,9503.927,And just wanting to know whether or not value engineering is being done . is it still planned?,192,,
992,0.97,9503.994,9536.793,"My recollection is that this really played a key role in decision to tunnel from Roosevelt, to close the Northgate station, and you know again, if value engineering is being done, I think that might be another reason to not lock in a decision at this time . and again, really just want to restate that I appreciate the need for the board to make realignment decisions.",192,,
993,0.97,9536.86,9539.396,I do continue to question the proposed timing.,192,,
994,0.97,9539.463,9541.098,Thank you.,192,,
995,0.97,9541.164,9551.975,"Cahill, would you speak to the examination of tunnel versus elevated cost in Seattle?",193,,
996,0.97,9552.042,9554.144,"Yes, can you hear me?",194,,
997,0.97,9554.211,9556.58,Yes.,195,,
998,0.97,9556.647,9557.047,Yes we can.,195,,
999,0.97,9557.114,9565.889,"Council member my slides, I don't know people get to them today but we do speak to the environment all process.",196,,
1000,0.97,9565.956,9579.803,You know we are publishing the draft EIS later this year and at that time we are able to speak to all the costs of the alternatives in West Seattle and have more detail on that . You had some preview of that of course in previous conversations.,196,,
1001,0.97,9579.87,9601.925,"And then of course as don mentioned, we are looking at cost savings effort throughout the quarter, looking to reduce cost and different things that we can do to Configue our alternatives to potentially hitting cost savings, part of the effort moving forward from this period as well.",196,,
1002,0.97,9601.992,9603.66,Thank you.,197,,
1003,0.97,9603.727,9606.63,Council member,198,,
1004,0.97,9606.697,9609.967,Thank you.,199,,
1005,0.97,9610.033,9620.444,"I have a question, I think it is further down, slides 37, in terms of how the station has served the community.",199,,
1006,0.97,9620.51,9626.45,My specific question is how you assess the safety and the design of stations.,199,,
1007,0.97,9626.516,9641.064,"I will give you two examples . at the mt . Baker station, which is elevated, there are areas below the platform that are poorly lit or have narrow corridors between the platform and other structures.",199,,
1008,0.97,9641.131,9651.508,"It is creating space right now where people are using drugs, it is dark in the evening and people find bullets under the platform.",199,,
1009,0.97,9651.575,9658.749,"So I am interested in understanding the process, for incorporating safety elements into the plan for folks that will be around there.",199,,
1010,0.97,9658.815,9685.642,"And then at the new Jenkins park station, as I mentioned before, you know, I know sound transit is working on sidewalk improvements directly underneath the platform, but lighting, street crossings within a couple hundred feet of the platform, the sidewalks leading to the platform, they also need improvement and safety.",199,,
1011,0.97,9685.709,9699.122,"Rainier Avenue is a fast read and there was a highway entrance just a few feet away . I am interested in what the planning is for keeping folks who will be walking to the station, safe in that space as well.",199,,
1012,0.97,9699.189,9704.861,"Cathal, would you briefly speak to slide 37?",200,,
1013,0.97,9704.928,9706.463,"Yes, sure.",201,,
1014,0.97,9706.53,9708.532,Remind me of slide 37.,201,,
1015,0.97,9708.598,9722.446,"[Laughter] essentially here, I want to highlight the station planning work, which I believe will directly address the concerns that the council member raised.",201,,
1016,0.97,9722.512,9730.42,"This is an effort that we have taken on with the city as long as Metro partners over the past years, to think about all things noted on the screen here.",201,,
1017,0.97,9730.487,9745.035,"From various project development, so we don't have issues you are highlighting . I think of those things early and we can account for those things and perhaps perhaps do a better job than was done in the past in this regard.",201,,
1018,0.97,9745.102,9759.716,"So we have had a lot of work in terms of station neighborhood forms in phase 1 of the project, that has informed our workshops, a noted effort that we have undertaken with the city and others.",201,,
1019,0.97,9759.783,9764.788,We are really thinking about all of these things on the screen here.,201,,
1020,0.97,9785.175,9792.949,I will skip interest of time but the slide will speak to the different roles to the city in this effort.,202,,
1021,0.97,9793.016,9798.855,"And then move onto the next slide, please.",202,,
1022,0.97,9798.922,9801.091,Really what you are talking about there is the station context.,202,,
1023,0.97,9801.158,9821.545,"As noted on this traffic, sound transit is very focused, the role to focus on the station itself as we see on the left . work nearing beyond the station and focusing on the work together with the city and others, with the station context.",202,,
1024,0.97,9821.611,9828.552,"The area working with sound transit and the interface and thinking about those concerns including safety, as you mentioned.",202,,
1025,0.97,9828.618,9830.921,And making sure that we consider that early in project development.,202,,
1026,0.97,9830.987,9835.091,Next slide.,202,,
1027,0.97,9835.158,9846.136,"I appreciate about how you are working together for future planning but as you and Mr. Rogoff mentioned, there are mistakes that were made planning that was not done this well.",203,,
1028,0.97,9846.203,9850.407,"In the existing track, which is where my district is.",203,,
1029,0.97,9850.473,9860.684,"You know, the existing light rail tracks are in Southeast Seattle, where the planning did not incorporate these principles.",203,,
1030,0.97,9860.75,9874.831,"My question is what will you do with the existing place to make sure the amount acre station is safe, to make sure that the Jenkins park area is designed with the folks in mind.",203,,
1031,0.97,9874.898,9893.817,"And so the stations that we do have in the city already, that the neighbors who are walking to and from the light rail station where there is poor lighting, or getting to the Columbia city station, that these areas already exist and can benefit from what you have learned.",203,,
1032,0.97,9893.883,9901.591,"In the past, from the past experiences, and can get access to the kind of safety improvements that they need.",203,,
1033,0.97,9901.658,9911.434,"Council member I might offer, we would be happy to come back and to go into greater detail on the existing system.",204,,
1034,0.97,9911.501,9934.157,"One thing I would note, that the St 3 plan includes a system access Fund, which is giving us the opportunity in fact to go back and look at some existing stations and partner with local jurisdictions to make improvements, to address the types of things that you are raising.",204,,
1035,0.97,9934.224,9952.342,"And in fact, in the first round of grant awards out of that Fund, the board did direct some funding to the city of Seattle, to make improvements in Southeast Seattle, and so we would be happy to come back and speak to that.",204,,
1036,0.97,9952.409,9960.417,And some of that funding I believe is also supporting the Jenkins park station that will open in a few years.,204,,
1037,0.97,9960.483,9964.688,Thank you.,205,,
1038,0.97,9964.754,9967.791,I will take you up on that and look forward to hearing more.,205,,
1039,0.97,9967.857,9968.958,Thank you.,206,,
1040,0.97,9969.025,9973.263,I think we have a final question from Council member Herbold.,206,,
1041,0.97,9973.33,9975.699,If she is still --,206,,
1042,0.97,9975.765,9986.276,And D. thank you so I just want to get back to the Cost-Saving Workplan.,207,,
1043,0.97,9986.343,9998.254,I am not sure I got an answer to the question [Laughter] about the cost decreasing . But let's put that aside for a moment here.,207,,
1044,0.97,9998.321,10021.044,"I want to also ask whether or not there are cost savings that are not just focused on capital cost savings, would love to hear that we are scrubbing all of our budgets, in administration and operation and maintenance, as well as to find cost savings.",207,,
1045,0.97,10021.111,10023.346,Thank you.,207,,
1046,0.97,10023.413,10053.343,"If Peter were he would really want to speak to that issue because there were a number of cost reductions that Heber deck--that he directed on the administrative side of the agency and also we are looking very closely at those long-% range operations and maintenance cost of the system, as well.",208,,
1047,0.97,10053.41,10062.585,"Almost all sound transit service is run by other transit agencies, on our behalf.",208,,
1048,0.97,10062.652,10068.958,It has been a lot of ongoing engagement on how we manage the cost over time.,208,,
1049,0.97,10069.025,10072.462,"You are absolutely correct, they do affect the overall financial plan as well.",208,,
1050,0.97,10072.529,10087.644,"If you get sort of a more full picture of that work, from Peter, --",209,,
1051,0.97,10087.71,10089.712,I am sure.,210,,
1052,0.97,10089.779,10091.981,Perhaps follow-up?,211,,
1053,0.97,10092.048,10094.05,I am sure he can with you.,212,,
1054,0.97,10094.117,10097.921,Thank you so much.,213,,
1055,0.97,10097.987,10157.714,"I want to for accepting our invitation to start this conversation on the sound transit 3, and all of the complexity involved in what you are trying to deal with right now in terms of changing revenues and costs, as well as the designing of the future stations, some things that Council member Morales talked about learning from previous Iterations . and we want to have you back at our Committee, to talk about the environmental impact statement, when there is a logical time to come back . and to take you up on your offer, I know individual Council members are eager to talk with you and do a deeper dive, if they have not already, on stations Impacting their districts or stations they are familiar with, and hearing about.",214,,
1056,0.97,10157.78,10185.508,"I hope that you take to heart some of the themes that you have heard today from a majority of the Council members and also from the public speakers today . and I really appreciate you being here and continuing to coordinate with our Seattle Department of transportation, thank you to director Sam Zimbabwe with your active engagement to sound transit on an ongoing basis.",214,,
1057,0.97,10185.575,10206.029,"You and your team of course really indebted to our board members, Debora Juarez, Mayor Durkan, and the ongoing advice that they get from Anne Fenness as well in the Mayor's office.",214,,
1058,0.97,10206.095,10221.144,"I want to thank everyone for staying for extra time today . and it will be available shortly for folks to take a closer look at and again, thank you sound transit and committee members.",214,,
