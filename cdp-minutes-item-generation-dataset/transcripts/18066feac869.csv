108,0.97,835.634,862.027,"As we advocate for increased funding for all types of housing, I note that affordable homeownership made possible by the levy is one of the most efficient ways to create affordable housing for people in the 50% to 80% median income and addresses the legacy of Redlining restrictive covenants and discrimination that has suppressed homeownership rates among people of color and the runaway housing costs withholding the American dream of homeownership.",26,,

132,0.97,1058.457,1081.079,So many more of our neighbors--as this process begins but we ask that you keep all current investments and significantly grow the levy to match the scale of affordable housing units in need and to recognize the increased cost of operating and maintaining supportive housing.,30,,
133,0.97,1081.079,1098.764,With your continued leadership on this important issue we can make deeper commitments to our neighbors who are still liking access to affordable homes and do more to support the workers who make permanent housing a highly successful model so they can afford to live in the city they are serving everyday.,30,,

239,0.97,2041.939,2049.981,"Thank you, Councilmember, this is my first presentation so this could be awkward because I have never done it on the site before.",50,,
240,0.97,2049.981,2060.258,I think the report shows the Testament of the dedication of the office of housing staff to the work and that they really do believe in it.,50,,
241,0.97,2060.258,2062.727,We will just start off with that.,50,,
242,0.97,2062.727,2069.233,"We have a couple of things to discuss, the first is the housing levy report, the annual housing levy report.",50,,
243,0.97,2069.233,2077.008,"The housing levy is Foundational, the most reliable source of funding for affordable housing.",50,,
244,0.97,2077.008,2099.33,"2021 was the fifth year of the current housing levy which was approved by Seattle voters in 2016 and the full 2021 housing levy report is available on our Website along with the other annual reports, the 2021 housing investments report, which you will hear about next, and reports on the mandatory housing Affordability incident zoning and multifamily extension program.",50,,
245,0.97,2099.33,2101.232,They are all on the Website.,50,,

247,0.97,2106.471,2109.407,"Good morning, Council members.",51,,
248,0.97,2109.407,2120.017,I am strategic initiatives manager and I will start with this overview of the primary programs funded by the 2016 Seattle housing levy.,51,,
249,0.97,2120.017,2129.126,"First, we have the rental production and preservation program which funds the development and rehabilitation of affordable housing throughout the city.",51,,
250,0.97,2129.126,2138.936,"Next, we had the acquisition of preservation program which purchases land and existing buildings to expand our affordable housing portfolio.",51,,
251,0.97,2138.936,2147.211,We rely on our critical operating and maintenance program to support the operating and maintenance costs of our permanent supportive housing projects and other affordable housing buildings in our portfolio.,51,,
252,0.97,2147.211,2151.082,We invest in Criminally affordable homeownership and home repair services.,51,,
253,0.97,2151.082,2156.587,And we find homelessness prevention and housing stability services.,51,,
254,0.97,2156.587,2164.662,Next I will walk through the incredible outcomes of the 2016 housing levy as of the end of 2021.,51,,
255,0.97,2164.662,2170.401,Chair Mosqueda share the headline but I will walk you through the details.,51,,
256,0.97,2170.401,2174.438,Three of our housing production programs have already exceeded their goals.,51,,
257,0.97,2174.438,2203.568,"The rental production, rental preservation, and homeownership development programs have produced beyond the goals established by the 2016 levy, our team and providers will soon meet the goals of the operating and maintenance programs we are currently serving 481 homes with this program, just 30 more to go and the homelessness prevention and housing stability services program is on track to meet his goals as it transitions to the King County regional homelessness authority.",51,,
258,0.97,2203.568,2207.905,We have one more chart that represents the outcomes of the housing levy.,51,,
259,0.97,2207.905,2219.317,"You can see on the far right side of this chart the accomplishments the office of housing team and our community of affordable housing developers and operators, some of whom you heard from earlier.",51,,
260,0.97,2219.317,2232.73,"In five years of the levy, we have built 2700 homes and the goal set was 2150, the second one was preserving 445 homes, exceeding the goal of 350.",51,,
261,0.97,2232.73,2239.237,We have added or maintained 314 homeownership opportunities which exceeds the goal of 280.,51,,
262,0.97,2239.237,2257.788,"At the bottom, you can see the acquisition and preservation program, we have added or preserved 1800 homes through acquisition and preservation program, lending $77 million to expand our housing and we will talk more about some of those projects.",51,,
263,0.97,2257.788,2271.769,"As you transition over, I want to also welcome Councilmember Herbold who has been with us for the last 25 minutes, joined us early in public comments, sorry I did not announce you at the beginning.",52,,
264,0.97,2271.769,2274.839,Thank you.,53,,
265,0.97,2274.839,2303.267,"These buildings Represet three of the seven buildings that opened in 2021, as you know, 2021 was in the smack middle of the pandemic, to have these buildings under construction during the pandemic took extraordinary efforts on behalf of the contractors and developers supplying extra Ppe, making sure contractors were safe when they went on site and I want to recognize that this is quite the feet to have these represented today.",53,,
266,0.97,2303.267,2315.68,"These three buildings in particular are funded and supported by the levy, amazing opportunities for homes in West Seattle serving chronically mental ill.",53,,
267,0.97,2315.68,2330.728,"91 graduation and homeless housing units at Queen and in uptown for Plymouth housing, and the incredible Anti- displacement work of Filipino community village with 94 homes for low income seniors.",53,,
268,0.97,2330.728,2352.45,"I want to recognize and honor that each of these represent a critical population that would not be able to live in Seattle but for this housing and recognize that one of these buildings is named after Kristin Benson, a case manager at Plymouth who lost her life serving the residents and the people, it is a challenge to do.",53,,
269,0.97,2352.45,2369.467,The naming of this building represents that these are pretty pictures of buildings but the work on the ground is so critical and the people serving communities and homeless individuals who are struggling is absolutely paramount to this ongoing effort.,53,,
270,0.97,2369.467,2373.738,Thank you to Plymouth and honoring her with the naming of this building.,53,,
271,0.97,2373.738,2377.975,I want to move on to the rental production and preservation.,53,,
272,0.97,2377.975,2380.01,We are talking levy only.,53,,
273,0.97,2380.01,2407.104,"Your incredible efforts and contributions, city Council, allows us to award 13 new projects, here is two supported by the levy in particular, $14.2 million in the creation of the project which is now in design and permitting and the continuation of the terrace development.",53,,
274,0.97,2407.104,2410.741,We also have the critical and important work of preserving what we have.,53,,
275,0.97,2410.741,2413.744,We will not be able to replace these affordable homes once they are built.,53,,
276,0.97,2413.744,2460.524,"It is very challenging to purchase on the open market and your allowance of us to preserve existing housing like the apartments you see here, this building in particular is currently what they call an Sro, they do not have bathrooms in the units, people have to go down the hall, the allowance of the support we did with this award last year allows them to change these two studio apartments and One-Bedroom apartments so during the next pandemic they do not have to walk down the hall and use the Restroom and potentially get Covid or whatever the next pandemic is . We are exceeding our goals for the rental program and the preservation program.",53,,
277,0.97,2460.524,2467.164,It is with great gratitude we are able to do this work.,53,,
278,0.97,2467.164,2467.565,Next slide.,53,,
279,0.97,2467.565,2473.137,"So, we also have to plan for the future.",53,,
280,0.97,2473.137,2473.37,Right?,53,,
281,0.97,2473.37,2481.212,"During the pandemic, we hit the gas pedal and your support of this effort allowed us to do some innovative and creative things.",53,,
282,0.97,2481.212,2488.586,Aurora heights housing was in acquisition of property that will create 450 apartments at some point.,53,,
283,0.97,2488.586,2509.507,"We were able to launch the rapid acquisition program, which you can see was, but for market rate housing that was coming Online in January of 2021, we were able to quickly move, purchase that building before anyone didn't and allow it to convert to homeless housing.",53,,
284,0.97,2509.507,2521.185,This was a tremendous opportunity that translated into an additional $210 million available at the state for additional rapid acquisition resources.,53,,
285,0.97,2521.185,2527.358,It was talked about nationwide and your allowance for us to do this incredible work allows more people to move off the street more quickly.,53,,
286,0.97,2527.358,2543.207,"Finally, we were able to acquire transit oriented development site opportunity at the Thunderbird and Maynard Beach which will allow at least 250 units in a critical neighborhood fighting displacement at a light rail station.",53,,
287,0.97,2543.207,2550.014,All of those allow us to do more in the future.,53,,
288,0.97,2550.014,2562.893,"Finally, one of the reasons why operating and maintenance--so, we award the capital investments of the project but then the project has to be built before we can award the operating and maintenance contract.",53,,
289,0.97,2562.893,2571.368,This is a critical resource that our service providers need in order to maintain and operate the buildings once they are open.,53,,
290,0.97,2571.368,2581.445,"We have a joke in the office that we can build buildings but if you do not have the operating support to keep the lights on, keep the roof replaced, we cannot open the doors and allow people to move in.",53,,
291,0.97,2581.445,2589.053,"This resource allows us to keep projects, specially Prioritizing homelessness individuals opening and operating for 20 years.",53,,
292,0.97,2589.053,2602.833,"That is why there is a lag on the progress towards the seven- year goals because the first levy takes a couple of years to build and, once the building is open, we commit to the operating and maintenance.",53,,
293,0.97,2602.833,2613.811,We are well on track and very grateful to Seattle housing authority who committed 300 vouchers to support the operation supporting permanent supportive housing.,53,,
294,0.97,2613.811,2623.22,We have consumed all of those vouchers and they are actively in operation in buildings today.,53,,
295,0.97,2623.22,2627.391,I will continue on with the homeownership investments.,53,,
296,0.97,2627.391,2633.13,"In 2021, we invested $3.4 million to create 33 new homes across three developments.",53,,
297,0.97,2633.13,2640.871,We listed nine new home buyers to purchase homes in--through home repair grants for foreclosure prevention loans.,53,,
298,0.97,2640.871,2643.474,This is an exciting project.,53,,
299,0.97,2643.474,2658.122,"This picture from community land trust and come on the next page, you can see two other homeownership developments that opened last year were 21 families are permanently owning their own homes.",53,,
300,0.97,2658.122,2660.324,Excited to see these new projects come to life.,53,,
301,0.97,2660.324,2678.042,"The homelessness prevention program has provided 350 households in imminent risk of homelessness and the rapid Rehousing program has provided 500,000 to support 120 households to move into stable housing from homelessness.",53,,
302,0.97,2678.042,2680.677,We love talking about housing levy engagement.,53,,
303,0.97,2680.677,2687.317,We have more work ahead of us as our team works to develop the proposal for the 2023 housing levy.,53,,
304,0.97,2687.317,2696.093,We are currently engaged with our housing Stakeholders and technical experts to explore policy and funding options for the 2023 levy.,53,,
305,0.97,2696.093,2708.072,"We have met with levy leadership group, our key providers, coalitions, funding partners and to meeting focus groups to deeply explore the programs of rental housing, homeownership, and equity.",53,,
306,0.97,2708.072,2712.71,We are regularly meeting with our housing levy oversight committee.,53,,
307,0.97,2712.71,2728.358,"Later this year we will convene a technical advisory committee that will further refine the housing levy proposal and, in the summer, we continue to share the story of the 2016 levy and refining our proposal.",53,,

309,0.97,2734.898,2737.735,This concludes our presentation on the levy annual report.,53,,
310,0.97,2737.735,2740.604,Thank you very much.,54,,
311,0.97,2740.604,2764.928,"I am excited we have this presentation in hand and will continue to lift up what has been done and what else there is still to do last week, we shared a number of informational Graphics on our social media and our newsletter, excuse me, yesterday, we highlighted all of the investments that have been made in the complementary policies that went along with the housing levy funds.",54,,
312,0.97,2764.928,2820.851,"I really appreciate that you have lifted that up and highlighted how this work alone is being Complemented with office of housing policies that we passed with our community housing Roundtable partners over the last few years, such as making sure we are no longer selling surplus city property on the private market and holding that public property in public hands, and building affordable housing on it in partnership with nonprofit organizations that are led by those most affected by displacement, that we have reaffirmed and advanced our policy to community preference affirmative marketing, that we are Complementing affordable housing investments with equitable development strategies so that we can Co- locate community services like Childcare and small business and community space on the first and second floors.",54,,
313,0.97,2820.851,2836.867,"El Centro, as described earlier today, it is housing Complemented by small business and Childcare, and community stakes, it creates opportunity for a sense of place and for more than just a House but truly at home.",54,,
314,0.97,2836.867,2839.303,Excited about this presentation in front of us.,54,,
315,0.97,2839.303,2859.957,"One of the things I want to lift up his how we have significantly expanded our affordable housing investments going from roughly $52 million in 2016 to last year $200 million in the 2022 budget, increase made possible in partnership with funding from the affordable housing levy that we are talking about today.",54,,
316,0.97,2859.957,2880.844,"Also, by adding in the Jumpstart dollars that was described, $97 million, nearly half of our investment in affordable housing in the budget last year coming from Jumpstart progressive Seattle and the range is going to increase as we think about that throughput, people needing to get out of shelters and into somewhere they can permanently call home.",54,,
317,0.97,2880.844,2890.754,We are on the continuum for how we are addressing this incredible crisis of homelessness and at the end of the continuum is a place to call home.,54,,
318,0.97,2890.754,2892.956,This is part of that solution.,54,,
319,0.97,2892.956,2931.728,"Mandatory housing Affordability investments, the news from earlier this week showed us that the funding has continued to increase coming in from Mha, the city council passed in 2019 which brought in about $76 million in 2001, again, enabling the office of housing to forward commit affordable housing dollars which is something that we passed in 2021 or 2020, I am not remembering right now, Traci, and this for commitment is allowing for us to make sure there is more funding ready for shovel ready projects.",54,,
320,0.97,2931.728,2951.882,"Much of this sounds like alphabet soup and can get lost, but all of these policies corresponding to additional dollars that the affordable housing levy is making possible is leaving to thousands of affordable units.",54,,
321,0.97,2951.882,2956.52,5400 affordable homes under development now with 4000 of those coming Online.,54,,
322,0.97,2956.52,2969.132,"I just don't think we can lift up the work that has been done by the office of housing and our affordable housing partners enough, and the importance of their stewardship over those public dollars.",54,,
323,0.97,2969.132,3010.307,"Thank you for this presentation, I look forward to hearing questions from colleagues and would be Remiss if I did not say that this type of work that we have invested in, the policy changes we have made, much needs to be Complemented by additional changes to the zoning strategies that our city currently uses and the importance of our comprehensive plan and community engagement strategies which are happening now that Council added funding for so we can make it truly robust community engagement process possible to our partners.",54,,
324,0.97,3010.307,3019.282,These all are the years that it's going--we need more funding and we need it fast.,54,,
325,0.97,3019.282,3024.688,"Councilmember Herbold, great to see you, thank you for your question, please go ahead.",54,,
326,0.97,3024.688,3025.956,Thank you.,55,,
327,0.97,3025.956,3033.73,"A couple of questions, I will try to get some of them out but in the interest of time you may want me to follow-up off-line.",56,,
328,0.97,3033.73,3035.098,Just let me know.,56,,
329,0.97,3035.098,3056.853,"In the area around preservation, the levy has two separate programs, there is the rental housing preservation program, and the acquisition of preservation program, and I just want to understand the difference between them.",56,,
330,0.97,3056.853,3059.689,I know I probably ask this every time you talk about the levy.,56,,
331,0.97,3059.689,3078.308,"I am interested in--I understand that one of those programs is focused on the city's existing portfolio of affordable housing and money used to repair, do maintenance, Rehab properties in the existing portfolio.",56,,
332,0.97,3078.308,3095.659,I am interested in which of these funds is used to acquire existing housing to put into the portfolio of the city working with our nonprofit providers to preserve it from being subject to the speculative market.,56,,
333,0.97,3095.659,3109.339,"I am interested in, which of these two funds functions that way, and how many units have we been able to preserve?",56,,
334,0.97,3109.339,3142.973,"And, I understand that the recommendation that we will speak about probably at another time, as it relates to a preservation program using Jumpstart funds, also has the focus and I want to understand a little bit about what is different and what is being newly proposed, and whether or not that will impact the existing levy program.",56,,
335,0.97,3142.973,3158.989,"And, on the operations and maintenance side, I am wondering whether or not housing levy dollars go to support operations and maintenance in affordable housing units that are not permanent supportive housing.",56,,
336,0.97,3158.989,3184.047,"In that same category, around the investments, I am wondering, the resolution we passed that allowed the office of housing to Pre-Commit 22--20 $22 in 2021, can you let us know if the office of housing did take advantage of that flexibility and commit any dollars?",56,,
337,0.97,3184.047,3200.23,And I would love to know more about new investments in using our community preference policies that Madam chair worked on quite a bit.,56,,
338,0.97,3200.23,3211.007,"When I chaired the civil rights Committee, I also did some work on getting some of those policies rolling and I would love to learn a little bit more.",56,,
339,0.97,3211.007,3211.308,Thank you.,56,,
340,0.97,3211.308,3225.088,"I appreciate all the work you did and we are so thankful, we could build on that as well, building plan intended.",57,,
341,0.97,3225.088,3229.292,"Madam chair, I am wondering if you could share those questions with us?",57,,
342,0.97,3229.292,3242.472,"I also realized I may have premature interrupted the office of housing, you have another half of your presentation that might answer some of these questions from the vice chair.",57,,
343,0.97,3242.472,3251.648,"If we can have those questions answered either as part of the second part of the presentation, and if there is additional follow-up, that would be helpful.",57,,
344,0.97,3251.648,3263.593,"If that needs to be today or in writing, that is Okay, but the vice chair has asked good questions for the second part of the presentation that I Preempted our discussion about.",57,,
345,0.97,3263.593,3277.273,"If it is Okay, Madam vice chair, we will continue with the presentation and see if the questions get answered.",57,,
346,0.97,3277.273,3279.242,Thank you.,58,,
347,0.97,3279.242,3286.416,"I am starting now the second part of the presentation, which is the 2021 investments report.",58,,
348,0.97,3286.416,3305.568,"The annual housing investment report reflects all investments across the entire Oh programs including investment in rental housing, the development of Criminally affordable For-Sale homes, and the support of low income homeowners to our home repair and home wise Weatherization programs.",58,,
349,0.97,3305.568,3317.047,"The annual investments report includes maps, including the geographic distribution of investments throughout Seattle and demographic information through these investments.",58,,
350,0.97,3317.047,3321.518,"Next slide, please.",58,,
351,0.97,3321.518,3328.692,"Okay, this is the city funded affordable rental housing chart and it gets confusing.",58,,
352,0.97,3328.692,3331.294,Bear with me.,58,,
353,0.97,3331.294,3341.638,Looking first at investments to create no affordable rental housing it is important to step back and look at how investments made each year build on each other to create thousands of affordable homes.,58,,
354,0.97,3341.638,3353.416,"Through investments made over the past 40 years, at the end of the 2021 year, Seattle had over 50,600 city funded rental housing units in operation across 328 buildings.",58,,
355,0.97,3353.416,3356.319,More buildings have already opened.,58,,
356,0.97,3356.319,3361.558,This graph shows the outcome of Oh investments and affordable rental housing over five years.,58,,
357,0.97,3361.558,3387.717,"As you can see, each year, hundreds of new homes open up they said prior years funding and in each year we make new funding awards, we are building the pipeline of new homes under construction permitting our otherwise--Okay, --",58,,
358,0.97,3387.717,3391.588,These are three additional buildings that opened in 2021.,59,,
359,0.97,3391.588,3406.603,"We talked about three levy funded projects and these are funded through Jumpstart, Mha,--not Jumpstart because these were funded in 2021, but the Federal dollars that came in last year.",59,,
360,0.97,3406.603,3426.79,"These three projects were able to be opened in 2021, again, during the pandemic, one was done by Gmd, 60 homes for individuals and couples, that would not otherwise be able to afford to live in Belltown.",59,,
361,0.97,3426.79,3443.006,"George Fleming place, the long beloved state legislator who is known for launching the state housing trust fund, a Uw Star football Player was named for this Lehigh project at the rail line station.",59,,
362,0.97,3443.006,3452.115,106 low income individuals and families will be able to maintain their housing here in this critical neighborhood that is facing displacement.,59,,
363,0.97,3452.115,3459.589,"Again, the wonderful opportunity to do the rapid acquisition.",59,,
364,0.97,3459.589,3466.329,Broadway hall is a representation of one of the rapid acquisitions we did last year which will serve 36 homeless young adults.,59,,
365,0.97,3466.329,3470.8,Supported in part by low income housing and youth care.,59,,
366,0.97,3470.8,3487.283,"This opportunity to use the Federal dollars, 16 of the Clifford dollars that came in through the Treasury last year is what allowed us to take advantage of opportunities in the market that would not have otherwise been available.",59,,
367,0.97,3487.283,3494.19,Going on--we tried to find projects throughout the city.,59,,
368,0.97,3494.19,3499.662,It is a challenge because it depends on who is bringing in projects at what time.,59,,
369,0.97,3499.662,3520.116,"We are dependent on the applicant in bringing in the project as to where the project is cited but we have wonderful opportunities that came into play in 2021 where we were able to award 1500 units, nine new construction, five rapid acquisitions, and a site for new development.",59,,
370,0.97,3520.116,3539.002,"This speaks a little bit to the question from Councilmember Herbold, we do have the rental housing program which actually can support preservation--but for naturally affordable, I think is the word you are looking for, buildings on the open market.",59,,
371,0.97,3539.002,3543.94,The challenge with that program coming into a permanent award is the timing.,59,,
372,0.97,3543.94,3558.187,A lot of times market rate sellers do not want to wait for the purchase of their building and that is where we use the acquisition and preservation program to support purchases of existing buildings with people living in them.,59,,
373,0.97,3558.187,3566.629,It is a little bit of a challenge because the people living in them have to meet our Affordability requirements.,59,,
374,0.97,3566.629,3573.403,What we don't want to do is displace further or harm further household that have been living in these buildings for generations.,59,,
375,0.97,3573.403,3576.94,That is a nuance we have to pay attention to.,59,,
376,0.97,3576.94,3598.594,"We have done quite a few acquisitions of existing buildings to preserve them from the open market, the Madison apartments on first Hill is an example, and some work we did with Seattle housing authority two years ago, where we preserve the three buildings that otherwise would have been available on the open market.",59,,
377,0.97,3598.594,3616.045,"Moving on, the preservation--I am sorry, go back, Stephanie, the preservation program of our portfolio, this is the rental housing and preservation program, the preservation can go towards projects that do not exist in the O.H.",59,,
378,0.97,3616.045,3620.917,Portfolio but it is critical to maintain the buildings we do have that are regulated in our portfolio.,59,,
379,0.97,3620.917,3647.243,"We are offering serving populations that cannot afford any significant rent payments and lack of income to support the buildings means we need to step in deeper and further to make sure the roof is replaced, the community spaces are safe, and exciting is there to protect the water intrusion of the buildings, and we do invest heavily into our existing portfolio to maintain those indefinitely.",59,,
380,0.97,3647.243,3652.548,Hoping that that provides some clarity.,59,,
381,0.97,3652.548,3658.755,Both the rental housing program can do preservation of existing portfolios and new product coming into our portfolio.,59,,
382,0.97,3658.755,3673.002,"In addition, the acquisition preservation program can move more quickly to acquire buildings on the open market that are at risk, especially Anti-Displacement work.",59,,
383,0.97,3673.002,3676.706,The number of buildings in acquisition preservation?,60,,
384,0.97,3676.706,3689.352,"You know, for this program at this time, I believe we did three, but we can get back to you on specifics on the acquisition preservation program throughout the year.",61,,
385,0.97,3689.352,3693.656,Over the lifetime of the program there has been many buildings acquired.,62,,
386,0.97,3693.656,3698.161,And pieces of land.,62,,
387,0.97,3698.161,3702.365,"Moving on, these are the funds that you all allowed.",62,,
388,0.97,3702.365,3719.215,"By allowing the Jumpstart 2022 amount of funds in which we were allocated $71 million, we put that to good use as we announced in the summer of last year, only $35 million available for the fall round.",62,,
389,0.97,3719.215,3735.731,"Your ability and your execution of the budget last year allowed us to expand those resources significantly and we awarded $86 million in the fall round, in addition to the work we did with rapid acquisition program, which totals $153 million.",62,,
390,0.97,3735.731,3763.092,"You will see the letter contributed $50.2 million, this is modest compared to the pilot, if you remember two years ago where we are committed money, this is the remainder for that option and the mandatory housing affordable options were made available, modest amount of incentive bonus payments as that program essentially does the replacement of the Affordability program.",62,,
391,0.97,3763.092,3775.938,Thank you to the $71 million from Jumpstart that allowed the 13 projects that were applied in the fall rental program round that we were able to support and fund.,62,,
392,0.97,3775.938,3789.552,"Finally, $16 million were available at a modest amount of home dollars were available in the fall round and in addition we use that in the rapid acquisition round.",62,,
393,0.97,3789.552,3794.023,Total allocation is $153 million.,62,,
394,0.97,3794.023,3825.721,"Here are some of the things we did in 2021 under the fall round, the rapid acquisition program with the beacon Hill apartments, a community health is supporting a program of 39 homeless units for women and couples, and men that need housing immediately and we were able to purchase the building off the open market, it did not have people living in it and we moved quickly to made it Programmatically acceptable for the work that they are doing.",62,,
395,0.97,3825.721,3856.953,"The religious lands legislation is allowing St. Luke's, the Episcopal church in Ballard, they are now supporting the bridge affordable housing project that is going to bring Online 85 homes in the neighborhood, critical neighborhood that we often cannot get into because of the high market competition that we face in the neighborhood.",62,,
396,0.97,3856.953,3886.315,"Finally, Long-Standing historic building on Capitol Hill at Broadway and pine is supported for affordable housing and youth homeless programs with youth care, 84 units at that partnership with community rich housing and youth care to do a number of things including support workforce housing and provide a place and work activities for young adult trying to get out of homelessness.",62,,
397,0.97,3886.315,3889.652,These are some of the projects that we were able to support.,62,,
398,0.97,3889.652,3933.562,"New hope Baptist church, in partnership with Lehigh, chief Seattle Club, in supporting their sacred medicine House project, and community land trust, these are the projects we love to support to fight the Anti-Displacement, a project in Columbia city continues the challenging work of doing by and for the community with Anti- displacement efforts and growing agencies to be a powerhouse for us in affordable housing development and they can be the go to agencies to support this ongoing effort that we have.",62,,
399,0.97,3933.562,3936.365,I will be taking over.,63,,
400,0.97,3936.365,3939.235,Stephanie from the office of housing.,63,,
401,0.97,3939.235,3952.848,We have heard about rental housing projects that were invested in 2021 using levy dollars and the other funding sources that were mentioned.,63,,
402,0.97,3952.848,3956.485,Now we will talk about homeownership development projects that were funded in 2021.,63,,
403,0.97,3956.485,3983.079,"As you can see, the purple dots represent four different developments that will create a total of 50 new Parmalee affordable for sale homes which means the homes will be sold to low income households and, upon resale, at whatever point the household decides to sell, they will be sold to another low income eligible household.",63,,
404,0.97,3983.079,3994.09,"Across all of these four developments, you will see 36 Condo units, two limited equity co-op homes, and 12 cottages.",63,,
405,0.97,3994.09,4002.665,I will give you the opportunity on the next slide to see a rendering of one of those projects.,63,,
406,0.97,4002.665,4015.311,"This is--we will get the picture and look at the chart, this picture of Highland terrace, this is a project that habitat for humanity will be developing in Dell ridge.",63,,
407,0.97,4015.311,4025.588,This will have 12 resale restricted permanently affordable two bedroom cottages for low income First-Time home buyers.,63,,
408,0.97,4025.588,4041.17,"Shifting to the left-hand side of the slide, you will see that we have $4.08 million dedicated from the Seattle housing levy to support homeownership and we have payments that will support homeownership development.",63,,
409,0.97,4041.17,4076.906,"As you all know, a portion of Mha contributions received are set aside specifically to support homeownership development and this is the first year that we are able to support a development, and homeownership the moment using Mha dollar, Olympic ridge, a habitat for humanity project, and that will have 17 one and two bedroom Condo units.",63,,
410,0.97,4076.906,4086.515,"Thinking about all of the housing investment across the board, both rental and homeownership, I want to take a moment to talk about where we are locating those.",63,,
411,0.97,4086.515,4096.025,"We strive, as we have said, to make sure we are distributing our investments across the city, neighborhoods across the city.",63,,
412,0.97,4096.025,4112.708,"We want to make sure our investments in those buildings were people will be calling home are accessible to reliable public transit, to jobs, schools, and other amenities you would need to life and thrive in your communities.",63,,
413,0.97,4112.708,4125.788,"We want to make sure we are investing in areas of the city that have high access to opportunities, as well as areas that households may be at high risk of displacement.",63,,
414,0.97,4125.788,4131.026,Youwill see in a moment where I will show you maps that illustrate that.,63,,
415,0.97,4131.026,4143.973,"Take a moment and look at the rendering on the right side of the screen, it is another housing--rental housing development that received funding in 2021.",63,,
416,0.97,4143.973,4158.787,"Again, as we talk about access to public transit, this will be a mixed income, Mixed-Use development that will include the affordable units we are funding, 200 affordable rental homes.",63,,
417,0.97,4158.787,4167.363,This will be two blocks away from the future light rail station.,63,,
418,0.97,4167.363,4168.964,Here are the two maps.,63,,
419,0.97,4168.964,4174.637,"On the left side, that map showing access to opportunity.",63,,
420,0.97,4174.637,4178.107,The right side is showing displacement risk.,63,,
421,0.97,4178.107,4189.718,"We have all of the housing investments, so, orange dots are rental housing, yellow dots are the rental housing developers that are receiving reinvestment or preservation.",63,,
422,0.97,4189.718,4197.76,"The purple dots, again, are the affordable homeownership projects.",63,,
423,0.97,4197.76,4212.675,"We have those investments spread throughout the city in areas with high access to opportunity, as well as in areas that households that are living there may be at high risk of displacement.",63,,
424,0.97,4212.675,4223.619,Moving to speak--we have been talking about the buildings and now let's talk about the people who live in the buildings that are funded thanks to city funds.,63,,
425,0.97,4223.619,4240.669,"So, on the left side, you will see the incomes of Renter households who were served in city funded apartments in 2020, the latest year we have available demographic data.",63,,
426,0.97,4240.669,4275.804,"You can see that 72% of those Renter households were making 0% to 30%, as an example, on the table below, for a Three- person household, 30% EMI in 2021, was $31,250, the 0% to 30% Renter households are individuals and families who are either going to be very severely cost burden the in housing or facing housing instability if looking for housing on the private market.",63,,
427,0.97,4275.804,4289.785,"On the right side of the screen, of those Renter households we have, about 42% of our households served are considered special needs households.",63,,
428,0.97,4289.785,4304.433,"That includes older adults, people who have chronic mental illness, people with different physical abilities, those who are facing addiction and other issues.",63,,
429,0.97,4304.433,4316.712,"Really, again, trying to give you a picture of the people, families and individuals who are served by housing that is receiving funding from the city.",63,,
430,0.97,4316.712,4321.283,"From Renter households, we will talk about homebuyers, or homeowners.",63,,
431,0.97,4321.283,4340.369,"So, the chart on the left is homebuyers assistant, that is low income homeowners--sorry, First-Time low income homebuyers, and the income levels of those people.",63,,
432,0.97,4340.369,4350.913,31 percent to 61% is the Orange.,63,,
433,0.97,4351.246,4368.03,"Just to give you an example, 60% EMI for a Three-Person household is $62,480, again, households who, on the private market, would really be purchasing a House would be out of reach for these households.",63,,
434,0.97,4368.03,4378.941,"Thanks to city funds and assistance coming from the city, these are First-Time homebuyers who are able to purchase a home.",63,,
435,0.97,4378.941,4395.023,"On the right side, you have our home repair and Weatherization program, we have yet mentioned these programs but this is an important piece of the office of housing's work.",63,,
436,0.97,4395.023,4403.799,We serve low income homeowners and make sure they are able to Affordably and safely live and stay in the homes they already own.,63,,
437,0.97,4403.799,4435.297,"As we all know, it is becoming more and more expensive to live in Seattle and if you are a Homeowner, the cost of living are stacking up, especially for low income homeowners, that is certainly true and these programs support low income homeowners to make repairs, health and safety repairs to their homes, and Weatherize them which can make the homes more comfortable during the winter and summer months.",63,,
438,0.97,4435.297,4445.073,"As we know, the summers are getting much hotter and the winters can be cold, making sure the homes are healthy for them to stay in.",63,,
439,0.97,4445.073,4460.222,"You can see a large number of the households are making 0%--earnings your present to 30% EMI, a lot are older adults living on fixed incomes.",63,,
440,0.97,4460.222,4472.868,You can see the spread of the rest of,63,,
441,0.97,4473.635,4482.611,I wanted to touch on this very quickly before we get our annual presentation from the change team.,64,,
442,0.97,4482.611,4491.353,We will be talking more about the racial demographics of the household served.,64,,
443,0.97,4491.353,4502.13,"Here just to give you some high- level points, 57% of the Renter households and 46% of homebuyers were led by a person of color.",64,,
444,0.97,4502.13,4512.708,That is compared to 37% of people in Seattle who identify as people of color or Hispanic in our latest five-year estimates.,64,,
445,0.97,4512.708,4567.93,"To answer or briefly touch on Councilmember Herbold's question on community preference, we will also talk more about the outcomes of that policy in our presentation on June 1ST . just to give you a little bit of a Teaser, the junction is one of the Renter--sorry, rental housing developments using village Gardens, the Homestead community land trust development that Councilmember Mosqueda joined for the opening in a quiet manner, which is a rental housing development that has not yet started . There are others that you will get an opportunity to hear about on June 1ST.",64,,
446,0.97,4567.93,4570.966,"So, I will pause there.",64,,
447,0.97,4570.966,4579.107,"That is the end of our presentations on the report, the housing levee report and annual investments report.",64,,
448,0.97,4579.107,4586.415,I want to answer Councilmember Herbold's question on the maintenance funds.,65,,
449,0.97,4586.415,4611.606,"The maintenance funds is 2500 per unit, which has typically been paired with the McKinney match required for homeless programs and to achieve new funding from the Federal Government . As we know, McKinney has not supported new projects in some time and primarily the 2500 per unit goes toward homeless projects.",65,,
450,0.97,4611.606,4634.563,"There is a way that we support Non-Homeless projects and it is using additional capital dollars to do what we call pie down the loan so this is typically in senior projects that have a mix of incomes where they have 30% AMI, 50% AMI, and some 60% AMI.",65,,
451,0.97,4634.563,4654.049,"When that occurs, the 30% still needs additional support, so what we do is reduce the amount of mortgage from a private Bank so the building and organization doesn't have to support a larger loan that they otherwise could afford and that supports the 30% A.M.I.",65,,
452,0.97,4654.049,4662.124,"Units we do it in a different way, just not for the operating and maintenance program.",65,,
453,0.97,4662.124,4666.395,Additional comments or questions?,66,,
454,0.97,4666.395,4697.693,"Just to respond to one more of Councilmember Herbold's questions, she was referring to a resolution and I believe it was the rescue plan ordinance that you may have remember we spent $60 million knowing that we couldn't give them all of the money they needed to do accusation and to do investment and development projects, but I think the answer to that question would be yes, they did and yes, they are.",67,,
455,0.97,4697.693,4702.597,Okay.,68,,
456,0.97,4702.597,4718.447,"I do think, you know, we are happy to take a few additional comments but we are running over pure colleagues, you should receive a calendar until 12:30 because we have three other items, but I wanted to take an opportunity for a few more questions or comments.",68,,
457,0.97,4718.447,4722.317,Thanks to the office of housing for being interested and able to answer questions in writing as well.,68,,
458,0.97,4722.317,4723.485,Councilmember Herbold?,68,,
459,0.97,4723.485,4725.554,Thanks.,69,,
460,0.97,4725.554,4757.052,"I just wanted to get a little bit local as far as the District investments . I appreciate seeing some of the homeownership projects in district 1, but as a district presented have, I want to ask a little bit about what's happening for the distribution of rental housing investments in district 1. it doesn't seem like a lot is happening even with the levy dollars.",69,,
461,0.97,4757.052,4773.301,I saw the bonus report that recently came out as well dollars that are coming from the District or don't seem to be going back into the district . I have a specific network of constituents.,69,,
462,0.97,4773.301,4785.48,"District 1 community network, they represent community organizations all throughout district 1 who have been asking and trying to organize for affordable housing in their neighborhoods.",69,,
463,0.97,4785.48,4827.756,"Probably two years ago probably before the pandemic hit, they provided to come out--sorry, the housing development to come out and talk to them to find out what they can be doing to get more rental housing investment for the needs of families who need affordable housing in a district and just wanting to understand whether or not Oh would be assisted by policies or approaches that would result in a more equitable spread of investments throughout the city.",69,,
464,0.97,4827.756,4829.291,Thanks.,69,,
465,0.97,4829.291,4837.465,"Laurie, do you mind taking about the investments upcoming.",70,,
466,0.97,4837.465,4846.875,"We have a pipeline, Councilmember Herbold, for projects we anticipate in your district.",71,,
467,0.97,4846.875,4848.844,There are two sites in Southpark we are working on.,71,,
468,0.97,4848.844,4850.912,"One of course the housing office purchased themselves soon, actually.",71,,
469,0.97,4850.912,4869.931,"Then there are several projects I know of in the pipeline coming our way and applying as soon as this fall, so we do anticipate changing that in addition of a couple sites in West Seattle that we are keenly interested in acquiring.",71,,
470,0.97,4869.931,4879.307,"The owner of those sites would be open to selling to the affordable housing community but it is a journey, right?",71,,
471,0.97,4879.307,4888.483,"You are in a very popular neighborhood in some of your jurisdictions . It is a challenge to compete against the market, right?",71,,
472,0.97,4888.483,4893.788,I know of at least four projects that we anticipate this year and next.,71,,
473,0.97,4893.788,4896.691,I am aware of the Southpark projects.,72,,
474,0.97,4896.691,4900.462,"Yes, thank you.",72,,
475,0.97,4900.462,4918.58,"I am focusing on the West Seattle side of the District and aware of the Aspirational hope as it relates to one project, but I really think we need to be doing more to generate more interest among our partners in developing West Seattle.",72,,
476,0.97,4918.58,4919.381,Thank you.,72,,
477,0.97,4919.381,4929.891,"One thing that will actually help quite a bit, the state legislator passed a tax exemption so that gives us a little bit of an edge.",73,,
478,0.97,4929.891,4946.574,"You get a real estate tax that kicks in in January of 2023. we are hopeful that will give us a little bit of an edge for competing against the market, but I know of one project in West Seattle coming this fall.",73,,
479,0.97,4946.574,4949.611,"You know of the second we are working on, but I absolutely agree with you.",73,,
480,0.97,4949.611,4958.153,It is a target area for our office.,73,,

534,0.97,5350.578,5375.57,"It is my understanding that are requesting that authority through the second quarter supplemental, so I think you will see that separately but it is not through this Council bill .

549,0.97,5516.677,5532.226,This Council very much appreciates that . We are trying to be conservative with the amount in the administration and redirecting the rest to strategies already authorized as components of the Jumpstart spending plan in relation to housing.,87,,
550,0.97,5532.226,5551.045,"Colleagues, this would mean that funding is being made available as the office of housing has said for it needed staff capacity to deploy the housing resource dollars to things already specified in the spend plan, including the vast majority for rental housing services at or below 30% A.M.I.",87,,

559,0.97,5589.884,5592.219,Seeing shaking of the heads.,87,,
560,0.97,5592.219,5607.735,"Again, thanks to the team at the office of housing for your existing stewardship of public resources and thank you for your attention to detail on how to deploy the remaining dollars with Jumpstart.",87,,
561,0.97,5607.735,5609.971,"With that, I will put the bill in front of us.",87,,
562,0.97,5609.971,5615.876,I moved the committee recommend the passage of Council bill 120318.,87,,
563,0.97,5615.876,5616.477,Second.,88,,
564,0.97,5616.477,5621.148,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson . are there additional comments or questions?",89,,
565,0.97,5621.148,5626.42,"Hearing none, will you please call the roll on the passage of Council bill 120318?",89,,
566,0.97,5626.42,5627.221,Herbold?,90,,
567,0.97,5627.221,5628.255,Yes.,91,,

572,0.97,5634.562,5635.363,Lewis?,96,,
573,0.97,5635.363,5637.398,Yes.,97,,
574,0.97,5637.398,5638.599,Chair Mosqueda?,98,,
575,0.97,5638.599,5640.801,Aye.,99,,
576,0.97,5640.801,5645.239,"Five in favor, not opposed.",100,,
577,0.97,5645.239,5648.175,Wonderful . It is unanimous.,101,,
578,0.97,5648.175,5657.084,The committee recommendation that the bill passed will be sent to the May 24th Seattle city council meeting for a final vote.,101,,
579,0.97,5657.084,5666.227,I appreciate it and we will see you very soon to talk more about the housing levy and all of the things coming out of the office of housing.,101,,
580,0.97,5666.227,5670.097,Thanks for your work and take care.,101,,
581,0.97,5670.097,5678.606,Let's move on to items three and four . We have two elementary pieces of legislation in front of us.,102,,
582,0.97,5678.606,5682.243,I will ask Madame clerk to read item 3 and four into the record together.,102,,
583,0.97,5682.243,5708.235,Council bill 120317 which adopted the 2021 budget including the 2021 to 2026 capital improvement program for possible vote.,103,,
584,0.97,5708.235,5720.614,"Andcouncil bill 120316, an ordinance amending ordinance 126490, which adopted the 2022 budget, including the 2022-2027 capital improvement program (CIP); changing appropriations to various departments and budget control levels, and from various funds in the budget; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts; all by a 3/4 vote of the city council.",103,,
585,0.97,5720.614,5767.595,"We are joined by ally Pennucci . We have the exceptions ordinance . It has become part of our routine course of business to retroactively approve spend ages in the next years that have not been completed, however I want to continue to underscore that we are in the midst of a process that we initiated two years ago to really examine processes that had been routine and to try to make sure we are creating greater transparency and accountability in the budgeting overall . I mentioned in our may 4TH meeting that we don't actually want to have it be routine to have an exceptions ordinance by its very name in nature.",104,,
586,0.97,5767.595,5770.431,It should be exceptional.,104,,
587,0.97,5770.431,5788.783,"This is part of the process that we currently have, but I do look forward to our ongoing conversations in the select budget committee meetings and in the Finance and housing committee meetings on how we can continue to create budgets that more accurately align with each of the departments needs for the budget in front of them for the upcoming year.",104,,
588,0.97,5788.783,5800.528,Ideally as we move toward a biannual budgeting as well . I really appreciate the work that Tom Mikesell has done.,104,,
589,0.97,5800.528,5822.449,"As you saw in the memo attached to this agenda and a circulated to the city Council, central staff has done great research on options to help us eliminate or reduce the need for exceptions to our budgeting practice . in front of us we have the exceptions ordinance, which I understand is the general ballpark of exceptions we have allowed in previous years as well as the ordinance.",104,,
590,0.97,5822.449,5840.734,I will let Tom Mikesell and ally Pennucci speak to what's in front of us and we can talk more on how we are trying to get a better sense of more accurate budgeting in the process of passing exceptions ordinance routinely.,104,,
591,0.97,5840.734,5852.112,"That is work to be done in the future, but in terms of this legislation in front of us, the two documents in front of us, this is in alignment with the similar practices of the past.",104,,
592,0.97,5852.112,5862.89,I will let Tom Mikesell and ally Pennucci walk through the details the you know what is coming forward in the ordinance before you so we can consider them.,104,,
593,0.97,5862.89,5869.163,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",105,,
594,0.97,5869.163,5874.435,I am ally Pennucci from a Council central staff and I will turn it over to Tom and I will share my screen.,105,,
595,0.97,5874.435,5878.505,"Thank you, ally . Thank you, chair.",106,,
596,0.97,5878.505,5881.141,"Hello, members of the committee.",106,,
597,0.97,5881.141,5892.92,This mornings Visitation will cover the 2021 carryforward and 2021 exceptions bills . If you could move to the next slide.,106,,
598,0.97,5892.92,5923.884,"So, similar to last year, what I plan to do is to provide an overview on how the city of Seattle budgets are adjusted throughout the year starting from the adopted budget including automatic carryforwards, which I will explain more what that means and also Supplementals that are before the Council during the year and finally the exceptions bill that gets submitted after the fiscal year has been complete.",106,,
599,0.97,5923.884,5931.725,And we will go into the details of significant highlights of the 2021 carryforward and exceptions bills.,106,,
600,0.97,5931.725,5944.305,"So, by way of background, state law on the citation noted here requires that by November of each year city council passes an annual budget for the year.",106,,
601,0.97,5944.305,5952.012,That budget authority covers operations from January 1ST through December 31st of the year.,106,,
602,0.97,5952.012,5968.495,Budget discussion and document includes reference to a multiple year capital improvements program . The actual budget adoption itself only ADOPTS one year of capital investments for the upcoming budget year.,106,,
603,0.97,5968.495,5977.438,"And into a specific terms, it was passed by the cancel on November 23rd last year.",106,,
604,0.97,5977.438,5985.713,It is the 2022 adopted budget and includes appropriations totaling $7.1 billion from all sources.,106,,
605,0.97,5985.713,6002.429,"So, moving into the kind of operating phase of the 2022 budget year, there is a technical adjustment that takes place and that is the accounting for automatic carry.",106,,
606,0.97,6002.429,6015.576,"State law allows for certain size cities, so Seattle being one of those cities, in fact, the only one to have Non-Lapsing capital appropriations.",106,,
607,0.97,6015.576,6036.964,That means monies that are dedicated for capital project improvements automatically carry into future years until they are either fully spent or the city council elects to average it or reduce those appropriations due to law.,106,,
608,0.97,6036.964,6051.178,"All other appropriations absent any other measure are assumed to be Non-Lapsing . that means when the fiscal year is complete at December 31st, the authority to spend that money goes away.",106,,
609,0.97,6051.178,6094.655,"The exceptions to that are grants . in the event that the Council ACCEPTS money from external sources, so grant revenue is a key type but there are service contract type revenues, there will be a provision in the ordinance to spend that money to provide for Non-Lapsing, so similar to the capital money and the ability for that money to be fully spent and a large part of that is due to the grant money is irregular and tied to performing a specific attachment to why the money was provided in the first place.",106,,
610,0.97,6094.655,6103.33,"It does not always align with a fiscal year, so the Council provides that Non-Lapsing authority.",106,,
611,0.97,6103.33,6124.451,Also there are other cases the Council made an ordinance and may provide more administrative authority to some select appropriations within the budget . those are all done within the budget legislation that provides those specific areas.,106,,
612,0.97,6124.451,6129.59,"And finally, encumbrances.",106,,
613,0.97,6129.59,6152.479,"This is essentially an accounting term which is providing shipping the budget authority to proceed complete contracts or agreements the city has already entered into the prior-year and providing the authority to spend money from the city Treasury when we receive those invoices, which can sometimes come after the year is complete.",106,,
614,0.97,6152.479,6164.124,That is an accounting level where we just want to ensure we have money to pay invoices when we receive them.,106,,
615,0.97,6164.124,6185.846,"By way of a high-level perspective, there is a detail on this on page--I believe it is page three of the memo . $1.9 million automatically carried forward across city funds.",106,,
616,0.97,6185.846,6191.952,"Thinking of last year's analysis, approximately the same amount that was carried forward into the 2021 budget.",106,,
617,0.97,6191.952,6211.371,It was about 27% increase in the budget for the year and that is across all funds . It is automatically adjusted into the revised budget and you will see at a later table how that affects the full context of the city budget.,106,,
618,0.97,6211.371,6214.841,Next slide?,106,,
619,0.97,6214.841,6220.38,"So, that covers the automatic authority.",106,,
620,0.97,6220.38,6227.287,The next piece in the discussion today is supplemental.,106,,
621,0.97,6227.287,6260.554,State law provides four Supplementals and I Referenced in the memo specific wording because it's interesting to know that it allows the Council to appropriate an emergency fund or other designated funds an amount sufficient to meet the expenditures of the city where appropriations have been made due to causes which could not have reasonably at the time of making the budget . that is the provision and a state law that allows for supplemental adjustments to take place.,106,,
622,0.97,6260.554,6293.92,"As noted in the definition that there is a threshold that applies, when there is an actual specifically stated emergency similar to the Covid emergency that is still in place, the threshold for supplemental adjustments to pay for things related to emergencies by the city council otherwise it is at a three-quarters approval threshold.",106,,
623,0.97,6293.92,6321.915,"However, there have been cases there are grant monies being received in the legislation that are completely funding the supplemental increase to the budget . It is a simple majority vote . Some of the legislation that has been approved so far this year has been subject to that because it is essentially accepting new grant revenue.",106,,
624,0.97,6321.915,6331.058,"And finally, just in terms of the nature of the Supplementals, there are Standalone or comprehensive bills.",106,,
625,0.97,6331.058,6376.57,"Standalone bills are a single subject and more specific, the grant acceptance ordinances have been passed are of that type and then there are more comprehensive ones, which are the ones we are talking about today where it is more of a process by which the city budget office solicits feedback or input from the departments on what their various needs are and collects that assessment across the city of what the proposed increases should be and submits kind of a package of adjustments that affect multiple funds and multiple city budgets . again, those are the ones we are talking about today.",106,,
626,0.97,6376.57,6378.004,"Thanks, Tom.",107,,
627,0.97,6378.004,6403.83,We have been working with the direction of chair Mosqueda to try to reduce the number of supplemental budget actions that the Council is asked to take up during the year . The number of budget changes make it difficult for the public and the Council to track what was approved and how funds are being expended and that kind of thing.,107,,
628,0.97,6403.83,6441.301,We will highlight we will moved from a quarterly supplemental process to we're hoping to get even more clearly twice a year projects or process and maybe supplemental that gets transmitted in September with the next years proposed budget and hope over time to streamline all of the individual ordinances into just those comprehensive midyear packages except when there are emergent situations that require immediate action.,107,,
629,0.97,6441.301,6447.641,"Just a little bit more detail--and thank you for adding that, ally.",108,,
630,0.97,6447.641,6454.981,Additional detail is covered on page three of the memo.,108,,
631,0.97,6454.981,6461.221,There have been four Standalone supplemental bills passed by city council thus far totaling $26 million.,108,,
632,0.97,6461.221,6477.337,These include appropriations for the Seattle rescue plan except a couple of acceptances of grants and finally Asked.Grant acceptance.,108,,
633,0.97,6477.337,6480.407,That is the activity thus far.,108,,
634,0.97,6480.407,6488.081,"The comprehensive bills are carried forward and as ally pointed out, the midyear and year-end supplemental bills.",108,,
635,0.97,6488.081,6504.464,"Finally, the exceptions which is instances where Department spending has exceeded the appropriation for the year and there is a request after the fiscal year.",108,,
636,0.97,6504.464,6507.4,This ties it all together.,108,,
637,0.97,6507.4,6514.107,"As you can see, we started with 2022 adopted budget of $7.1 million.",108,,
638,0.97,6514.107,6518.578,You can see the general Fund and other funds split.,108,,
639,0.97,6518.578,6529.523,"$96.7 million automatically carries over into the general Fund and $1.8 million in other funds, bringing the total adjustment to $1.9 billion.",108,,
640,0.97,6529.523,6549.175,"Standalone bills, the bills I just mentioned add another $26.8 million budget authority, bringing the total revised budget to shy of $9.1 billion, which is roughly a 27% increase to the adopted budget.",108,,
641,0.97,6549.175,6562.789,"So, with that kind of context without budget adjustments in general, I will dive into some of the specific details of the bills before you this morning.",108,,
642,0.97,6562.789,6573.6,Council bill 120316 would increase the city budget across all funds by $127.7 million.,108,,
643,0.97,6573.6,6582.909,The summary attachment submitted with the legislation shows the detail for all of these proposed changes as submitted by the executive.,108,,
644,0.97,6582.909,6604.497,"Central staff has reviewed those to determine whether or not they meet the character and nature of a carryforward, so essentially continuing work that was Forgone in 2021 that is anticipated to continue into 2022 and resources shift across the fiscal years to continue that work.",108,,
645,0.97,6604.497,6622.148,What I have done in the memo and in this presentation is just pulled out the most significant changes of those items that are of the Council's interest to kind of show the bulk of where the funds are going.,108,,
646,0.97,6622.148,6636.129,"I would also point out the memo, the Appendix on page nine includes a very detailed table showing the information I have covered so far.",108,,
647,0.97,6636.129,6647.34,"The starting points, carryforward adjustments, quick staff revised budget.",108,,
648,0.97,6647.34,6652.812,You can see the percentage increases to each Department because of this bill.,108,,
649,0.97,6652.812,6658.518,These are the presents I show on the slides.,108,,
650,0.97,6658.518,6693.853,"The community development would increase by 95% based on the appropriation bill . The overwhelming chunk of that is in the general Fund and that is to continue the equitable development . It is basically for awards that have not yet been contracted . It is ensuring that the money is available to deliver those monies . Similarly, there is $5.7 million, 14% of the culture budget.",108,,
651,0.97,6693.853,6721.081,That is a general fund increase to implement strategic investment allocations . The strategic investment for a little back story was funded originally in the 2020 budget from sales proceeds for a variety of purposes . $30 million . The Council continued that in 2021.,108,,
652,0.97,6721.081,6729.355,This request would continue this money to be available to complete the projects we were awarded last year.,108,,
653,0.97,6729.355,6738.965,Also there is an increase to the general fund budget.,108,,
654,0.97,6738.965,6747.44,The most significant part of that is for the Participatory to continue in 2022.,108,,
655,0.97,6747.44,6757.584,Rounding out there is $7.6 million or 4% increase general fund to the Department of education and early learning.,108,,
656,0.97,6757.584,6768.695,$5.4 million is to basically have money available to honor the 2021-2022 school year contracts.,108,,
657,0.97,6768.695,6774.534,Those are the largest on a percentage basis.,108,,
658,0.97,6774.534,6778.004,There are a few other noteworthy items on the next slide that I pulled out.,108,,
659,0.97,6778.004,6783.643,One is $7.8 million general fund increasing for the office of housing.,108,,
660,0.97,6783.643,6785.879,This is for rental assistance.,108,,
661,0.97,6785.879,6799.292,"They will administer the program, however the contract had not been completed at the end of 2021.",108,,
662,0.97,6799.292,6801.127,They need to be available to pay those amounts.,108,,
663,0.97,6801.127,6812.672,And finally there is $4.4 million general fund increase to the human services Department and this is for the safety capacity building.,108,,
664,0.97,6812.672,6830.924,"They were appropriating monies for capacity building to continue through 2022, however this would also include ensuring the amounts exist in 2022 to do the administrative side of the work.",108,,
665,0.97,6830.924,6842.535,I believe that is the carry it forward bill.,108,,
666,0.97,6842.535,6854.514,"Before I continue, I will pause to see if there are any questions.",108,,
667,0.97,6854.514,6856.049,"Chair Herbold, go ahead.",109,,
668,0.97,6856.049,6860.086,I just want to restate what I think this presentation shows.,110,,
669,0.97,6860.086,6871.998,The carry it forward--there is no new proposed uses for those dollars . It is a carryforward from the original purpose as budgeted.,110,,
670,0.97,6871.998,6874.634,"Chair Herbold, that is exactly correct.",111,,
671,0.97,6874.634,6877.303,That is one of the factors that central staff looks at.,111,,
672,0.97,6877.303,6883.576,Otherwise it could be for supplemental items.,111,,
673,0.97,6883.576,6887.647,Thank you.,112,,
674,0.97,6887.647,6890.65,Thank you very much.,113,,
675,0.97,6890.65,6905.098,"Okay, now I will move to the exceptions . So, the total requested increase of the 2021 exceptions bill is $13.3 million.",114,,
676,0.97,6905.098,6922.448,"There are two primary notable items in this bill and again, this is an exception from the $6 billion, $7 billion budget but it is indicative of monies we are spending higher than the budget appropriations for the fiscal year.",114,,
677,0.97,6922.448,6927.086,The first one is the Seattle Department of human resources.,114,,
678,0.97,6927.086,6929.922,This is the Healthcare Fund.,114,,
679,0.97,6929.922,6936.229,$6.45 million overage based on unanticipated claim activity at the end of the year.,114,,
680,0.97,6936.229,6950.443,"Those claims were paid because they were due to be eligible and valid by the Department, however the authority did not have the time to fully make them.",114,,
681,0.97,6950.443,6989.382,"Next within the Seattle Department of transportation, there is a total of $6.8 million, $5.1 million or $5.2 million from the transportation Fund and 5.6 from the levy fund due to an assortment of emergency response and operation support . again, similar to the unanticipated claims activity, these were items that were not expected according to the Department and therefore were in excess of the 2021 budget.",114,,
682,0.97,6989.382,7001.794,And so building off the chairs--I can see your question and I am happy to address.,114,,
683,0.97,7001.794,7007.734,"Madam chair, please go ahead.",115,,
684,0.97,7007.734,7018.678,"The exceptions ordinance, we are not providing new money . We are providing the authority for money they have already spent, correct?",116,,
685,0.97,7018.678,7019.445,Okay.,116,,
686,0.97,7019.445,7022.949,Thank you.,116,,
687,0.97,7022.949,7025.518,"Go ahead, Tom.",117,,
688,0.97,7025.518,7051.611,"If we could look at the next slide, this is some ongoing work that we have been doing at a staff level based on as the chair mentioned the ordinances have become a sort of regular practice and piece of legislation and therefore we have done additional research.",118,,
689,0.97,7051.611,7060.286,One piece of that is covered in the memo on page--let's see.,118,,
690,0.97,7060.286,7070.263,Page seven . It is a detailed table showing the Department characteristics of the past five years of the ordinance.,118,,
691,0.97,7070.263,7072.265,I didn't go further than that.,118,,
692,0.97,7072.265,7093.853,I set a point in time and went forward just to show the size and nature of the bills that have been accrued in the past years and really it is sort of sporadic in terms of the departments that are having exceptions to the budget authority.,118,,
693,0.97,7093.853,7106.432,"As explained in the memo, the total size of the bill ranges from $5 million in 2017 to a high point of $30 million last year.",118,,
694,0.97,7106.432,7109.001,It is sort of a regular trend.,118,,
695,0.97,7109.001,7115.908,"$13 million in 2018 and 2019, similar to the bill that is before you today.",118,,
696,0.97,7115.908,7133.059,"A key take away, the exceptions ordinance has become and recently is a regular practice and as such, it posed a question of is this a regular practice?",118,,
697,0.97,7133.059,7158.851,What I did is just again picked a universe to sample and looked at the largest first-class cities and contacted their finance officials to understand that they similarly have this type of legislation as their budget adjustment practice . I did not get any response but that is a regular practice for those other cities.,118,,
698,0.97,7158.851,7168.528,I would point out city of Seattle is significantly larger than their next first-class.,118,,
699,0.97,7168.528,7193.386,"And Furthermore, our level of budget control is at the Vcl level, which is a program plus fund level of restraint were as other cities notably Tacoma control at the fund level, meaning it is easier for lack of a better word to stay within budget when the level of control is more broad.",118,,
700,0.97,7193.386,7209.368,"With that being said, the management capacities between Seattle and the other peers are most likely different, meaning there are more staff available to manage budgets in the city of Seattle and other cities.",118,,
701,0.97,7209.368,7218.511,"Again, it's just a bit of context to show what the lay of the land is in this state.",118,,
702,0.97,7218.511,7235.027,"So, by way of issue identification, I will continue with the line of thought on how to address it if there is a desire to address the exceptions ordinance as a regular practice in Seattle.",118,,
703,0.97,7235.027,7246.272,"One option, and this kind of builds on comments from the director at the May 4TH presentation, which is regular monitoring.",118,,
704,0.97,7246.272,7263.823,This is a way to show budget--spending against budget trends in a more consistent and public way and to give advanced notice that we may exceed budget and corrective action may be necessary.,118,,
705,0.97,7263.823,7283.342,That action could be taken for example in the year and supplemental bill that Council receives . kind of another option is contingent appropriations.,118,,
706,0.97,7283.342,7299.191,"This is thing identify those places and areas where it is more likely for there to be a need to spend over budget, though it is not 100% certain.",118,,
707,0.97,7299.191,7301.594,"At the Department level, it provides some level of contingent appropriations.",118,,
708,0.97,7301.594,7306.732,This is similar to the Department of constructions.,118,,
709,0.97,7306.732,7318.711,There is contingent authority to spend it the revenue is higher than the anticipated because it is assumed the revenue will support work that needs to be completed in that year.,118,,
710,0.97,7318.711,7322.381,Something along that line could be an option.,118,,
711,0.97,7322.381,7330.289,I would note that would reduce the level of fiscal control.,118,,
712,0.97,7330.289,7336.729,You have a contingent appropriation and you have a little less budget constraint.,118,,
713,0.97,7336.729,7362.188,"Along a similar line, the city has a transfer policy in place that allows the budget director to transfer $500,000 between Bcl s in the Department to correct this sort of thing and in some cases, that is clearly already occurring when there is a possibility to do so.",118,,
714,0.97,7362.188,7399.959,"However, given the dollar amounts we have been talking about so far today, $500,000 is insufficient to cover this level, so there could be some thought and we haven't had detailed conversations on what that would look like, but something that would revise the transfer policy so that these budget exceptions could be handled at a more administrative level . again, similar to option B, the Trade- off would be reduced fiscal control . one of the reasons there are exceptions is because there is a fiscal control in place that says this is the level authority that you have.",118,,
715,0.97,7399.959,7416.375,"Any sort of change that would release the pressure valve a bit is just logically reducing fiscal control . and finally, no action, of course, is an option.",118,,
716,0.97,7416.375,7422.248,I would add here we are in discussions with the city budget office on some of these options.,119,,
717,0.97,7422.248,7428.821,"For example, if we go back--it is in the memo, not the presentation.",119,,
718,0.97,7428.821,7442.601,"If we look at the memo, the Department of transportation has budget exceptions and the Department of human resources in three of the five years.",119,,
719,0.97,7442.601,7479.138,Part of the discussion is really looking at those departments in particular and making sure their appropriation authority for the annual is set appropriately as well as looking at these other options and can Trailering considering the points as Tom pointed out the appropriation authority on the one hand as well as trying to avoid having to take up this exceptions bill on a regular routine basis.,119,,
720,0.97,7479.138,7490.95,"All right, well thank you very much and thanks for the comprehensive memo . If folks haven't had a chance to read it yet, I would encourage you to do so.",119,,
721,0.97,7490.95,7510.002,"There is no pressing question the Council or Committee is poised to ask today regarding these issues that have been identified from essential staff, so we wanted to flag that there will be ongoing policy conversations about how to help create a remedy for the exceptions ordinance are truly exceptional.",119,,
722,0.97,7510.002,7530.589,"On page seven, for example, you will see in 2020, we saw the 2020 calendar year be exceptional in that it was over twice the amount of money as we hadn't seen compared to the other four years and perhaps that should be expected because 2020 was exceptional.",119,,
723,0.97,7530.589,7534.226,It was the year Covid first hit the city.,119,,
724,0.97,7534.226,7538.097,We were one of the first areas in the nation to be impacted by Covid.,119,,
725,0.97,7538.097,7548.44,"In many aspects, we did see the departments stepping up to try to provide additional services in new ways and that required additional spending.",119,,
726,0.97,7548.44,7566.926,"You know, recognizing there may be times we may need something that looks like an exceptions ordinance is a good governing practice it is good budgeting to make sure we don't have exceptions ordinance on a routine basis.",119,,
727,0.97,7566.926,7577.903,"Thanks so much for Teeing up this conversation, Tom, and for the work you have done especially in Vancouver, Spokane, and Tacoma to see what their practices are.",119,,
728,0.97,7577.903,7600.225,"I know you have brought experience from other those practices used in those jurisdictions has helped improve the conversations we are having, so I want to thank the city budget office and Julie specifically in her interest in working with us to figure out if there is a remediation strategy or different path we should be taking as it relates to exceptions ordinance is.",119,,
729,0.97,7600.225,7608.567,"Again, just Teeing this up for an early and transparent discussion in the context of considering the exceptions ordinance.",119,,
730,0.97,7608.567,7618.177,"Colleagues, are there any questions about the two Council bills in front of us and need additional clarification of any sort as we consider this legislation today?",119,,
731,0.97,7618.177,7619.078,Okay.,119,,
732,0.97,7619.078,7623.382,I am seeing no additional comments or questions.,119,,
733,0.97,7623.382,7629.922,"Ally or Tom, do you have anything you would like to offer in closing?",119,,
734,0.97,7629.922,7640.032,"Madam chair, enclosing I would just talk about the rest of the year in terms of known Supplementals.",120,,
735,0.97,7640.032,7657.082,There is likely if not already transmitted soon to be transmitted supplemental which would provide a 2022 annual wage increases and holiday appropriations for Juneteenth instituted as people stay.,120,,
736,0.97,7657.082,7691.45,"That bill will go to full council because it is essentially giving appropriation authority for hire Council actions, you know, coincident with those prior authorizations and finally, we anticipate soon to receive a midyear supplemental that will include a grant acceptance bill and finally a year and supplemental submitted with the budget process this fall, which would be the grant acceptance.",120,,
737,0.97,7691.45,7693.419,That concludes my comments.,120,,
738,0.97,7693.419,7701.76,Does the legislator usually do one supplemental?,121,,
739,0.97,7701.76,7705.03,"Madam chair, that is my understanding.",122,,
740,0.97,7705.03,7710.269,It is determined based on session.,122,,
741,0.97,7710.269,7720.145,"Yeah, still looking forward to moving us toward a one time midyear supplemental.",123,,
742,0.97,7720.145,7723.148,I appreciate we have been able to move away from the end of year supplemental.,123,,
743,0.97,7723.148,7730.656,It is not ideal to conclude our budgeting at the last week of November to receive a supplemental request that first week of December.,123,,
744,0.97,7730.656,7732.858,Everyone is exhausted at that point.,123,,
745,0.97,7732.858,7736.428,Great work has been done in this arena.,123,,
746,0.97,7736.428,7755.614,"Thanks in large part to the partnership with the new city budget office director and their interest in working with us, but really in large part to the heroic efforts of essential staff . Thank you again to Tom Mikesell and ally Pennucci.",123,,
747,0.97,7755.614,7758.684,"And with that, colleagues, we might be able to get out of here before noon.",123,,
748,0.97,7758.684,7760.319,We have two bills in front of us.,123,,
749,0.97,7760.319,7766.759,The first relates to the exceptions ordinance.,123,,
