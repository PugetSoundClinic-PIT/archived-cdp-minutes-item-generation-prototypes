103,0.97,707.373,713.045,I went through the whole process of following along that development.,21,,
104,0.97,713.045,722.088,"I'm not against development at all, but I think there needs to be a comprehensive plan neighborhood by neighborhood on the full impact that's going to happen.",21,,
105,0.97,722.088,731.997,"This alley was already considered and Nonfunctionig, Nonviable alley because of its restrictions on only having a 16 foot width.",21,,
106,0.97,731.997,766.665,"That is not going to change, or the ability to have two-way traffic is never going to happen, and to force all their parking and all their delivery, et cetera, to be on the alley only is really going to put a burden on all the neighbors and create a long-term negative effect between neighbors, which is not what we want, so I just ask that director and your crew really, fully vet out these at least, and what is the best for everyone involved, so that we have a progressive approach to the development.",21,,
107,0.97,766.665,767.433,Thank you so much.,21,,

131,0.97,884.65,899.265,"My heart always SLOWS when I hear it, but I feel like it is so Disingenuous, and it's just not fair for us any longer to say we're going to respect the time we are here and the choices we make, when it is clear that what we're doing to our large trees is not following that belief.",31,,
132,0.97,899.265,907.94,"Every week, I'm made aware of more exceptional trees being cut down.",31,,
133,0.97,907.94,925.424,"I guess I am the neighborhood tree person now because people from all the neighborhoods are sending me Emails, finding on Instagram, and telling me about different trees coming down in their neighborhood, and how many of the birds are being impacted till next nesting season.",31,,
134,0.97,925.424,928.093,I'm going through extreme grief right now because there's nothing I can do.,31,,
135,0.97,928.093,929.762,I just feel we're at a point.,31,,
136,0.97,929.762,940.873,"We know it's undisputed that there's a climate crisis, and the large trees may actually be the only thing left to help us.",31,,
137,0.97,940.873,947.913,What is the city going against its own climate plant and its own canopy growth goals and allowing the removal to continue to happen.,31,,

322,0.97,2358.522,2392.389,"I think Aly, the new chief from our city council staff has done a great job summarizing they amendment by am I. I also want to thank Freeman for working with us on the Council bill, as we knew transit and is implemented a new state law, which allows religious institutions to increase density on land they own or control if they provide affordable housing for several decades.",77,,
323,0.97,2392.389,2401.599,"The three amendments posted already Online in my view refine the bill, we make sure to serve our low income neighbors.",77,,
324,0.97,2401.599,2413.978,"While amendment one still enable some units to serve residents earning as much as 80% AMI, the overall average must serve those at 60% of area median income.",77,,
325,0.97,2413.978,2419.183,Bringing that average down to serve lower income neighborhoods.,77,,
326,0.97,2419.183,2429.56,"Amendment two would increase the number of years the project must remain affordable from 50 years to 75 years, which matches a key provision of the mandatory affordable housing.",77,,
327,0.97,2429.56,2456.821,"Amendment three would close, what I view, is a loophole on the definition of the word ""controlled,"" so that the religious organizations maintain meaningful control of their properties, and the fourth and final amendment which I circulated to any members this morning simply asked the executive for the annual reporting on the implementation, such as the Affordability restrictions used, public subsidy used if any, and the organizational structures.",77,,
328,0.97,2456.821,2460.324,I'm happy to answer questions about the ordinance.,77,,

334,0.97,2481.579,2491.055,"I won't go into great detail because Councilmember Pedersen covered much of what I was going to say, but I will perhaps walk one by one for purposes of the discussion and if there are any questions from you or your colleagues on that.",79,,
335,0.97,2491.055,2527.358,"Amendment one as Councilmember Pedersen described would lower the average affordable housing income eligibility threshold to 60% of AMI for Renter households it would retain the 80% area median income or AMI requirement for home ownership units . as an example what this might look like if you had 100 unit building built under this new requirement, you could meet or do better than the average 60% required if there was a mix of 30, 60, of units that will be affordable to households at 30%, 60%, and 80% of AMI.",79,,
336,0.97,2527.358,2531.462,"30 at 30% AMI for 60% AMI, 30 of the units at 80% of AMI.",79,,
337,0.97,2531.462,2541.305,That is one example of the type of mix of units that could be included in their property and meet this new requirement with the averaging.,79,,
338,0.97,2541.305,2542.773,I will leave it at that.,79,,
339,0.97,2542.773,2546.41,"Thank you, Aly.",80,,
340,0.97,2546.41,2548.078,That is very helpful.,80,,
341,0.97,2548.078,2556.72,"I guess I will relay my thoughts on these amendments and if anyone else has questions, please be ready.",80,,
342,0.97,2556.72,2560.624,I want to thank Councilmember Pedersen 40s amendments.,80,,
343,0.97,2560.624,2563.093,I think they have good intention.,80,,
344,0.97,2563.093,2566.897,"However, I will not be supporting the three amendments today.",80,,
345,0.97,2566.897,2582.146,"I have heard, you have heard in public comment from bill Ramos, the chair of--the church Council of greater Seattle with concerns about these amendments.",80,,
346,0.97,2582.146,2619.149,"I think that further Stakeholder ring is needed and necessary for each of these, and in particular, I want to thank Councilmember Pedersen for bringing the fourth amendment today, which will give us reporting data for a year from now on how we might refine this policy . one of the reasons I won't be supporting the amendments today is because I think further Stakeholder is it necessary, and many have been relying on the bills passed by the Legislature, as a field goal, as an understanding of the framework and how this legislation will be passed here at City Council.",80,,
347,0.97,2619.149,2643.273,"For amendment one, when most properties that utilizes legislation will be proceeding as subsidy from opposite housing that requires the Affordability, 60% or area median income or below, if the church is able to provide affordable Workhouse housing without city funds, this is the flexibility that is needed in the current legislation that does not include the amendment.",80,,
348,0.97,2643.273,2660.29,"I believe we should encourage this flexibility rather than prevent it, and I think that a year of receiving the data regarding this would be regarded to make a fully informed decision.",80,,
349,0.97,2660.29,2662.926,I'm not completely opposed to the intent of this amendment.,80,,
350,0.97,2662.926,2664.995,I'm just not comfortable supporting it at this time.,80,,
351,0.97,2664.995,2676.94,"I am open to continued conversation about whether changes like this are necessary, and I would like to see how the program plays out before we make those changes.",80,,
352,0.97,2676.94,2683.047,"Councilmember Pedersen, I appreciate this amendment . I appreciate the intent it comes with.",80,,
353,0.97,2683.047,2687.117,"I won't be supporting it today, and I leave the door open to continue this conversation.",80,,
354,0.97,2687.117,2692.256,"Colleagues, any questions?",80,,

356,0.97,2694.324,2703.333,I also want to thank Councilmember Pedersen.,81,,
357,0.97,2703.333,2706.437,You gave me a heads up on some of the amenities you are considering.,81,,
358,0.97,2706.437,2708.272,I appreciate them being posted on the agenda as well.,81,,
359,0.97,2708.272,2722.086,"I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I was not able to get a chance to review those until late last night and I did not get a chance to ask you some questions in advanced, but Councilmember, appreciate the ongoing intent, I believe, to try to make sure there is greater clarification that the dollars are being used for the lowest affordable housing.",81,,
360,0.97,2722.086,2737.801,"I think the concern I have echoed would be the good chair that Strauss had said, and that is a greater Stakeholder input that is needed, but most notably, and I'm not sure Aly, if you or Teresa have had a chance to Opine on this.",81,,
361,0.97,2737.801,2768.699,"My concern with this type of restriction is always about whether or not we are leaving out the ability for funding that allows for the projects to be fully funded . I know our intent is to always make those up for as low an income population as possible, recognizing though that sometimes having 60% to 80% AMI on-site allows for the creation of the 0% to 50% AMI housing.",81,,
362,0.97,2768.699,2781.044,"In an effort to try to make this focused on lowest income if we don't already have that sort of workforce housing element included, sometimes it makes projects that even viable, and that is my concern with that amendment.",81,,
363,0.97,2781.044,2789.686,"And I don't know, Teresa, or Aly, if you have any additional comments on the viability of projects . I don't know.",81,,
364,0.97,2789.686,2796.793,"Councilmember Mosqueda, thank you.",82,,
365,0.97,2796.793,2805.002,Most of the city's programs to target or in some cases require a 60% or below area median income.,82,,
366,0.97,2805.002,2812.676,"For example, the mandatory housing of Affordability housing requires new nets meet 60% AMI requirement.",82,,
367,0.97,2812.676,2845.075,"This amendment would actually be similar to some of the allowances under the low income housing tax credit program which allows for some income averaging, so this amendment as drafted would allow for the mixing of unit types . Some could be up to 80%, and some could be as low as zero or anywhere in between, as long as the overall average is 60%, but it would not allow for, you know, a unit and 90% AMI or that type of thing, so it does allow some flexibility.",82,,
368,0.97,2845.075,2872.936,"I think the committee heard in briefing from director Alvarado of housing is that they have established the 80% requirement in part because in looking at that, that may be an option where a religious organization might be able to self fund the housing project and be able to sustain that without public subsidy.",82,,
369,0.97,2872.936,2879.843,"Howver, if they are seeking public funds, it's likely the Affordability requirements would be lower than 80% AMI in most cases.",82,,
370,0.97,2879.843,2891.955,That is sort of the trade off I think that the director laid out for the committee in the previous discussion.,82,,
371,0.97,2891.955,2892.623,Thank you.,83,,
372,0.97,2892.623,2893.423,That was really helpful.,83,,
373,0.97,2893.423,2905.168,"I think it is clear if charges or developing organizations are using city funds, they have to provide affordable housing below 60% area median income.",83,,
374,0.97,2905.168,2921.685,"This additional 20% allows for some of that flexibility to see if they will provide for this, so I just want to check Councilmember Lewis, do you have any questions at this time?",83,,
375,0.97,2921.685,2922.886,"I'm ready to vote, Mr.",84,,
376,0.97,2922.886,2923.287,Chair.,84,,

379,0.97,2928.659,2929.726,I appreciate the discussion today.,86,,
380,0.97,2929.726,2947.577,"I think that my approach was this came from Olympia, and I was trying to tailor it to our goals, which I know we hope to have more affordable housing, which we mean by lobe income housing.",86,,
381,0.97,2947.577,2952.182,I know there are different approaches to that.,86,,
382,0.97,2952.182,2955.118,"I think it is the right amendment, which is why I put it forward.",86,,
383,0.97,2955.118,2986.65,"I'm so happy . If for some reason, it does not pass today, hope that other moments pass or at least amendment four so we could monitor this and find out how it is being used, because I think that, you know, we are kind for me a benefit to marketplace that does not exist today, and I personally think we should be getting that additional public development for lower income housing.",86,,
384,0.97,2986.65,2990.587,I appreciate being able to make my case today to the committee.,86,,
385,0.97,2990.587,2991.221,Thank you.,87,,

410,0.97,3045.175,3068.498,"Amendment two, as Aly had described earlier with simply extend the length of the Affordability period, so right now, state law voted the bipartisan Crafters of the state law wrote it as just 50 years, and I think public benefit should go on for longer to 75 years.",105,,
411,0.97,3068.498,3101.665,"Anybody who has experience, I note that the change from 50 to 75 will not impact the ability to secure financing for these types of projects, and I think that this will be an appropriate public benefit, additional public benefit for the zoning benefit that we would be conferring with this legislation, so I'm happy to answer questions.",105,,

415,0.97,3115.178,3140.971,"One tool I have seen the city use is that, as the building continues in its life, it can receive additional funds from the office of housing, and that extends the covenants on the deed, so if a building is built, and within 50 years and needs upgrades or improvements in any way, to use office housing dollars . those are covered for another 50 years.",106,,

418,0.97,3151.281,3189.653,"So, I know from a project in my district that I am working on, there is some confusion about the implementation currently of current law, so by making this change today without being able to engage the Stakeholders ahead of time, I believe that it is adding more confusion in the time that we need clarity for this specific project . So, again with this amendment, I won't be supporting it today, and I am open to continuing conversation, because I think your intent is in the right place.",106,,
419,0.97,3189.653,3213.843,"And at this time, I also don't believe that imposing a higher burden in order to participate in the program is necessary because we have that secondary check of ensuring that a building that needs renovations or improvements will then continue as low income housing Affordability.",106,,

429,0.97,3254.417,3255.418,Yeah.,110,,
430,0.97,3255.418,3266.63,"Councilmember Mosqueda, most grounds require a 50 year term, and as Councilmember Pedersen describe the state statute requires at least a 50 year term, so that is the minimum required.",110,,

439,0.97,3308.338,3323.987,A really good discussion and good point about how housing typically deals with the end of the fifty-year term if they are renewing their financing and renewing that requirement that Affordability stay on for another 50 years.,114,,

458,0.97,3403.967,3500.363,"The word ""controlled by"" is very open ended, so want to make sure that the relationship and the religious institutions maintained meaningful control of their properties, that they are not taken advantage of by For-Profit entities, and that the intent of the legislation was owned or controlled by, and we want to make sure it's gotten under control, so we intend to define that in this amendment by saying an organization would have to--and this is the way we would define it from a lending perspective, underwriting who has control of the organization, and so typically it's the amendment which is at least 51% ownership or they have a specific management role in the organization, so it could be on the 99% by a For- profit low income tax investor, which is standard, but as long as the nonprofit or religious institution has management, so management control such as, and the amendment uses language ""such as"" it's not overly restrictive, such as a general partner in a limited partnership or such as a manager of a limited liability company in terms of the two standard ownership entities . I would be willing to in some additional flexibility into don't have a loophole of what the word ""controlled by"" means.",126,,
459,0.97,3500.363,3500.964,Thank you.,126,,
460,0.97,3500.964,3513.276,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen . consistently with the two amendments, I'm open to continuing the conversation, and Unfortunately will not be supporting the sentiment as well.",127,,
461,0.97,3513.276,3516.98,I like your intent of narrowing the definition.,127,,
462,0.97,3516.98,3531.561,"I think as we heard from bill Ramos, the chair of the church Council of greater Seattle, that we need more time and conversation to get this right.",127,,
463,0.97,3531.561,3547.877,"Speak legislation that this bill is based on was intentionally left abroad in setting the definition of controlled in recognition that for churches to make affordable housing deals work, they often have to be created and how those deals are structured.",127,,
464,0.97,3547.877,3557.22,I'm concerned this definition before us right now could be to narrow and exclude project that would otherwise be eligible to provide units of affordable housing.,127,,
465,0.97,3557.22,3581.644,"For example, if a church wanted to partner with a nonprofit affordable housing developer and sell their property to that developer while working on the project, this limit could preclude them from taking advantage of the bill, which would be contrary to what we're trying to achieve and what the state has this legislation in order for us to achieve.",127,,
466,0.97,3581.644,3587.016,"It's also not clear to me exactly how this amendment will be interpreted and implemented, something that I found time and time again.",127,,
467,0.97,3587.016,3606.336,"We have certain intentions here when we pass laws, and the interpretation can oftentimes be very different, and this is the one important aspect of the whereas nonbinding closet so we're able to share our intent with the legislation that comes after the whereas clauses.",127,,
468,0.97,3606.336,3633.796,"I am concerned this amendment could be interpreted to prevent a church from signing along with the nonprofit developer or require a church to own and manage the affordable housing units themselves, which is a job often left to housing providers . that is why, again, I support your intent, can support the sentiment today, and open to continuing the conversation.",127,,
469,0.97,3633.796,3639.902,"Colleagues, do you all have questions, or, Aly, is there anything you would like to add?",127,,
470,0.97,3639.902,3643.006,"Chair Strauss, I don't have anything to add at this time.",128,,

480,0.97,3674.804,3682.245,I do want to continue to see how we can get more clarity on whether or not the intent is being achieved.,131,,
481,0.97,3682.245,3686.149,I think the concern I have is similar to what the chair just mentioned.,131,,
482,0.97,3686.149,3706.536,"We have done a lot of work to follow up on the state legislative intent to reduce barriers in making sure they can have as simple of a process to partner with affordable housing developers by a nonprofit organization to use their property to create what we need in the city, which is more affordable housing.",131,,
483,0.97,3706.536,3715.378,I do worry about a definition that could be perceived as potentially restricting them in how they partner with these organizations to create that affordable housing.,131,,
484,0.97,3715.378,3747.276,"I think there's already strong Affordability requirements here while Partnering with organizations and nonprofit developers that can help them accomplish what they would like to see grow on the site will serve those who, I think, the sponsor's intent is really trying to center these amendments on, but I don't want to do anything that inadvertently adds additional barriers when we have yet to see how this partnership is currently going to be defined, so let's do everything we can to help these churches partner with organizations to build housing.",131,,
485,0.97,3747.276,3755.985,This is something that I have been hearing about for the last three years working on Council.,131,,

This is Sdci's second quarterly report to the committee, and we are joined by director Nathan total said, the Land-Use director and the engineering service director all from Sdci . would you all like to begin and walk us through this presentation?",204,,
651,0.97,4691.753,4692.12,Great.,205,,
652,0.97,4692.12,4706.134,"I will begin again, Nathan Torgelson, director of Sdci.",205,,
653,0.97,4706.134,4706.835,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",205,,
654,0.97,4706.835,4708.57,I am just going forward to the next slide.,205,,
655,0.97,4708.57,4712.674,"Again, Sdci's purpose is to help people build a safe, livable, and inclusive Seattle, and our values are equity.",205,,
656,0.97,4712.674,4726.888,"We lead with race, and we very seriously look at permitting through the race and social justice lens, and our other values are respect, equality, integrity, and service.",205,,
657,0.97,4726.888,4741.203,"So, just a reminder to the viewing public, a lot of you think of us as issuing permits and administering the designer review program, but we're also very involved with Codevelopment with code enforcement.",205,,
658,0.97,4741.203,4757.185,"This includes tenant protection, rental registration inspection ordinance program, and the vacant building monitoring program, and we're involved almost every day in the community engagement.",205,,
659,0.97,4757.185,4782.043,"So, just a refresher on our permit processes . a lot of applicants will go through a master use permit process and the construction permit process . If somewhat is subject to a master use permit process, this is typically a design review or some kind of Land-Use approval process such as a variance.",205,,
660,0.97,4782.043,4816.845,"You would first apply for a master use permit . There is a Pre-Application, intake appointment, reviews, a decision, potentially an appeal to the hearing Examiner, and issuance, and it is really the applicant's call on when they apply for a construction permit . in a very hot market, the construction permit will come shortly after the master use permit, but the applicants can certainly wait until that master use permit is issued before they submit for a construction permit.",205,,
661,0.97,4816.845,4822.083,"But again, the two often occur concurrently.",205,,
662,0.97,4822.083,4842.704,"So, once a permit comes in, there are multiple review locations within Sdci, as you can see on the slide here and there are numerous places were a permit would be routed, and again, it depends on the type of project and the complexity of the project.",205,,
663,0.97,4842.704,4866.294,"Permits are also routed to other city departments as appropriate, and this can include Sdot, it might include Finance services if there are issues, the office of housing, Department of neighborhoods, and if a project is adjacent to a city Park, it will also be routed to our parks Department.",205,,
664,0.97,4866.294,4890.719,"Thank you, and director Torgelson, I think I mentioned it is in our Premeeting briefing, that the next report, it would be great to have these other departments join us to understand what the staffing levels are of each . Maybe we can go back to slide six as we're speaking about this.",206,,
665,0.97,4890.719,4918.847,"It is important, as I learned in the last permitting report, that some of these divisions within the departments have 4 members of their team, and some have 20 members of their team, and if a team only has 4 members, and 1Ú retires, leave the office, or that position is vacant, it can create a backlog more significant than 14 people.",206,,
666,0.97,4918.847,4950.812,"It is important that I would like to invite these other departments to our next permitting report meeting so that we can have a good understanding of which of these divisions and teams need additional staff so that we can ensure that we're able to move, permit, processes through to approval as quickly as possible, and these unintended Backlogs are created by issues that we can resolve.",206,,
667,0.97,4950.812,4951.212,Great.,207,,
668,0.97,4951.212,4951.88,Thank you.,208,,
669,0.97,4951.88,4955.784,Very much appreciated.,209,,
670,0.97,4955.784,4963.391,This is the slide that basically discusses a project that's underway to revise the way we currently communicate necessary corrections.,209,,
671,0.97,4963.391,4970.732,"Currently, we write correction letters with focus plan review.",209,,
672,0.97,4970.732,5001.396,"Unfortunately, that tool is built on all technology and is really getting end of life, and there's an opportunity to move into this new tool called blue beam, which will allow us to actually mark up plans that are submitted within the tool and have those Markups be Hyperlinked to correction items that are generated in the correction letter, similar to the way we do it today, but with added Functionality that you can look at the plan itself and go to the correction item in the correction letter, or you can go backwards, vice versa.",209,,
673,0.97,5001.396,5031.393,"Our hope with this is to make it more efficient for plan reviewers to communicate with applicants . clearly, where corrections are required, if they can respond in kind to each of those corrections and be able to do that in a more efficient way, hopefully to reduce the Cycling of corrections, the number of times a correction letter needs to be written over and over again because of lack of response to outstanding corrections.",209,,
674,0.97,5031.393,5032.394,This project is currently underway.,209,,
675,0.97,5032.394,5041.369,The goal is to reduce corrections cycles.,209,,
676,0.97,5041.369,5068.83,"We've already rolled out licenses were a number of plan reviewers, so they are using a tool as a viewer as opposed to Adobe pro, where you can view those Pdfs that are submitted as part of the applications, and we're fully integrating it with our excel Implementations, so when correction letters are written and corrections are reviewed, that those letters and those documents will Upload into our electronic document and notify the applicant right of way as soon as available . We have partnered with other jurisdictions around state.",209,,
677,0.97,5068.83,5073.301,A lot of my team use blue beam.,209,,
678,0.97,5073.301,5087.715,"A lot of stuff we are acquired over the last few years have worked in those other jurisdictions and have a lot of experience with it already, so we're utilizing, tapping into the expertise to move this ball forward.",209,,
679,0.97,5087.715,5090.618,"Hopefully, we'll have this ready to go fully in September.",209,,
680,0.97,5090.618,5102.497,"Vice chair Mosqueda? I'm noticing on Seattle Channel, previously, our faces were included next to the slides as we were presenting.",210,,
681,0.97,5102.497,5120.081,"I'm not seeing that occurring today, so when you do speak, maybe just an ounce your name so that I know the difference between director Torgelson and Andi's voices, but the public might not.",210,,
682,0.97,5120.081,5121.282,"Vice chair, take it away.",210,,
683,0.97,5121.282,5128.89,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",211,,
684,0.97,5128.89,5133.795,I wonder if that button has inadvertently not been hit.,211,,
685,0.97,5133.795,5142.904,"So, I wanted to just check in here on these first few slides.",211,,
686,0.97,5142.904,5180.341,"I guess my biggest question is what have we been doing on the Macrolevel to set better targets? the two prior slides did not have any Timelines associated with that Flowchart, so I would like to know what review targets we're specifically tried to hit to make sure permit issued by Sdci are being addressed as quickly as possible, how did the Department arrive at these targets, and is there any way to advise these targets, given the previous presentation we saw was such a decreased number.",211,,
687,0.97,5180.341,5193.354,"Quite frankly, the concern about revenue being lost and also the impact in small businesses and organizations.",211,,
688,0.97,5193.354,5215.777,"I have been contacted by a business and lower Queen Anne in the Bay area who was basically told it would take six months to get his business reopened Post-Pandemic, and that just seems like that's going to be a nail in the coffin if he's not able to meet more assistance in a faster way, especially in the Post- pandemic reopening world.",211,,
689,0.97,5215.777,5217.045,Is going to take in six months.,211,,
690,0.97,5217.045,5237.599,"He's worried about staying afloat, so do you have any types of targets we can NOTE in the Post-Covid world and any data on the types of businesses submitting applications, and a portion of those applications are small businesses or housing.",211,,
691,0.97,5237.599,5246.474,"I guess, I mean, just an overall general update since the last time we have been here because it looks like blue beam is sort of the main thing you are reporting out that is different from the last time.",211,,
692,0.97,5246.474,5251.879,Are there any other ideas Besides the blue beam effort to report progress on the first quarterly report?,211,,
693,0.97,5251.879,5261.422,Really appreciate your questions . We have several additional slides that do address some of the issues you are raising.,212,,
694,0.97,5261.422,5272.6,"We are happy to entertain those questions now, or we can continue with the presentation and answer those questions at the end . Whatever is your preference.",212,,
695,0.97,5272.6,5273.001,Mr. chair?,213,,
696,0.97,5273.001,5284.145,"Let's see because I know those questions are addressed in some of the upcoming slides because vice chair Mosqueda, your question is spot on.",214,,
697,0.97,5284.145,5284.946,What are the targets?,214,,
698,0.97,5284.946,5287.649,Do they need to be revised?,214,,
699,0.97,5287.649,5288.916,And how do we process those?,214,,
700,0.97,5288.916,5301.663,Those are three points I would like to really have a Fine- tuned answer to before we move into the budget process this coming fall.,214,,
701,0.97,5301.663,5303.264,"Mr. chair, I have reviewed the slides.",215,,
702,0.97,5303.264,5310.738,I am aware of the full presentation and have taken a look at all this like there.,215,,
703,0.97,5310.738,5315.076,"Mr. Torgelson, I want to make sure to have questions for the following slides that I appreciate the direction, Mr.",215,,
704,0.97,5315.076,5315.343,Chair.,215,,
705,0.97,5315.343,5320.782,I would happily wait for your advice.,215,,
706,0.97,5320.782,5325.953,Great.,216,,
707,0.97,5325.953,5346.874,"Some of the key permitting Takeaways, we are meeting many of our permitting goals, but as Councilmember Mosqueda pointed out, other goals we are not meeting, some of those are due to staffing shortages in key review locations, and some are due to other reasons that we'll hit upon later.",217,,
708,0.97,5346.874,5364.392,"Sdci experienced a huge significant vesting rush in the first quarter of this year . If you recall, the city adapted new technical code legislation that went into effect March 15th.",217,,
709,0.97,5364.392,5379.54,"This is no building code regulations, mechanical code, and probably the most significant with the new energy code regulations, so we had a huge rush of building permits that came in before the effective date of March 15th.",217,,
710,0.97,5379.54,5386.581,"So, we are extremely busy reviewing and processing those building permits.",217,,
711,0.97,5386.581,5423.284,"What we're seeing now is much lower permitting volumes and evaluations, but sort of looking at a forecast for the months ahead . me to expect those permit volumes to pick back up again . Most trade permit types have returned to Pre-Pandemic issue at times, and by trade permits, I mean things like boilers, refrigeration, electrical, mechanical elevator . Some of those are one time permits just associated with construction . Some of those permits are Annuals.",217,,
712,0.97,5423.284,5436.33,"For example, we inspect elevators on an annual basis.",217,,
713,0.97,5441.169,5456.984,"Despite, you know, the challenges of last year, Sdci's intake to issuance review times and the number of review cycles have remained fairly consistent, but again, we recognize that we need to improve on that as we go forward and as we get out of the Covid situation.",217,,
714,0.97,5456.984,5467.495,"And director office of housing and Andy, if you could address the questions, that would be great.",218,,
715,0.97,5467.495,5469.931,This is Andy Higgins.,219,,
716,0.97,5469.931,5487.014,This slide is talking about the work that we have done over the past decade to continuously improve our processes and try to reduce our handling of the permit obligations and the time that is spent in Sdci or the city's hands.,219,,
717,0.97,5487.014,5504.932,"You can see over the course of time, the percentage of time, that Blackline decrease is the amount of time it's in our hands relative to the overall input time from intake to issuance due to the fact when we checked our corrections, there's an aspect of that time we have no control over.",219,,
718,0.97,5504.932,5525.887,"You can see that over the decade, as the economy sped up, the overall time did increase, and I think you are seeing a little plateau and decrease here on the simple and media constructions, but on the complex construction permits, it is still on the rice.",219,,
719,0.97,5525.887,5533.06,A lot of those permits came in like director Cw 36.78.545 said because they were investing through the fire code.,219,,
720,0.97,5533.06,5545.573,"A lot of those projects came in at the end of 2020, at the beginning of 2021.",219,,
721,0.97,5545.573,5561.589,"Our intake was 6.2 billion last year an hour issuance was only 2.1, so there's a huge backup of permit applications in the system, many which will stay in the system on applicant's choice, but we'll continue to try to do our part as quickly as possible.",219,,
722,0.97,5561.589,5576.637,"Just to add to that, from an Sdci revenue standpoint, not all, but the bulk of permit fees for building permits are coded at application and Non- issuance.",220,,
723,0.97,5576.637,5586.781,"Vice chair Mosqueda, do you feel your questions have been answered? after you make your comments, I have a couple questions.",221,,
724,0.97,5586.781,5602.196,"I think the key take away that you ended with, director Torgelson, is an important want to underscore because it is not, I think, our intent to be consistent with the review times, right?",222,,
725,0.97,5602.196,5611.272,We want to make sure we're actually improving and not just admitting in terms of our review times.,222,,
726,0.97,5611.272,5611.672,Correct.,223,,
727,0.97,5611.672,5615.977,"It is a hard skill to look at here, but there is a slight uptake still in the delay time.",224,,
728,0.97,5615.977,5641.802,"Heuer permits are being submitted in 2020, but the delayed time is still very concerning, so I guess the biggest question I was trying to get at earlier is what is different in this quarterly update versus last quarterly update, and how are we trying to identify new ideas to expedite permit that are in the pipeline, given high cost of materials, cost of labor, and the need for us to open up very quickly, right?",224,,
729,0.97,5641.802,5659.92,"This is like unprecedented times, and we've done a lot in the last year to try to make sure businesses can stay afloat, and I feel like we need to apply that same mentality with our applications and review the Timeline here and be very flexible in how we're helping folks reopen.",224,,
730,0.97,5659.92,5667.228,One thing and test this is Andy again.,225,,
731,0.97,5667.228,5681.308,"One thing I can add is in 2020, because of the hiring freezes that went into effect and the fact we had term limited positions that were ending at 2020 and the building plan's classification, we were unable to Proactively add back flows from attrition and retirements during 2020.",225,,
732,0.97,5681.308,5689.55,We initiated a hiring process at the beginning of 2021 after the 2021 budget was put into place.,225,,
733,0.97,5689.55,5731.092,"That converted all of our building plans to regular ongoing funded, and we just brought on board eight new building plans examiners in the last two weeks, so we understand we predicted six months ago that we would be behind due to the vesting rush and the fact that we are having challenges staffing because of those constraints, but now, we have put that in place, so we anticipate things are going to pick up significantly in the next three to six months as they get trained up and Onboard as well as we put in lace some opportunities for facilitating and expediting small business applications, and director Torgelson, you may want to talk more about that aspect.",225,,
734,0.97,5731.092,5734.095,Happy to do that.,226,,
735,0.97,5734.095,5736.564,Should I go ahead and do that now?,226,,
736,0.97,5736.564,5740.701,Share.,227,,
737,0.97,5740.701,5742.436,And then I will ask my questions afterwards.,227,,
738,0.97,5742.436,5747.775,I want to make sure vice chair is questions are answered.,227,,
739,0.97,5747.775,5779.74,"So, Sdci will be in the process of hiring a permanent liaison, which will focus on the vacant storefront spaces downtown . It will also focus on small businesses throughout the city before the pandemic, the Mayor put up a small business task force, and also look at our arts and cultural businesses that have really suffered during the pandemic.",228,,
740,0.97,5779.74,5784.411,This will be a central point of contact within our Department will help facilitate the permit review for those special types of permits.,228,,
741,0.97,5784.411,5789.55,That is one immediate improvement that we're in the process of making.,228,,
742,0.97,5789.55,5797.625,Someone to really handhold that applicant and to help them understand what permit performance are.,228,,
743,0.97,5797.625,5805.065,"The last thing we want to do is have a small business owner come in and sign that lease, and discover what the actual requirements are.",228,,
744,0.97,5805.065,5808.335,Thank you.,229,,
745,0.97,5808.335,5810.171,Thank you again for offering additional time here.,229,,
746,0.97,5810.171,5813.874,I appreciate the note about the hiring freeze question.,229,,
747,0.97,5813.874,5829.59,"I think that's why the Council works so hard to make sure we aren't exactly engaging in austerity budgeting, which I assume is part of the reason you see an Uptick in the Postrecession time, when the recession hit Washington state in 2010 and '11.",229,,
748,0.97,5829.59,5839.466,"I appreciate that it has also been six, seven months since the Council did pass the 2021 budget.",229,,
749,0.97,5839.466,5841.902,Appreciate the hiring that you have done has taken place.,229,,
750,0.97,5841.902,5849.977,"But director Torgelson, I'm concerned I'm not hearing specific targets.",229,,
751,0.97,5849.977,5889.817,"I appreciate the Handholding liaison personnel, but I think what I am asking is if the experience of the small businesses that I'm hearing is a six-month process, if the data continues to show the average number of days within an Sdci be relatively high right now, we have specific targets where we're going to say, ""look in this post pandemic world as we are reopening in the next 12 months, the next 6 months, our commitment is going to be that we get people through the process in two months of a certain amount of days is reasonable for the small business because six months is not ."" I'm not hearing a specific Timeline that you are responding to the need for flexibility.",229,,
752,0.97,5889.817,5903.163,"Vice chair, I will jump in here to kind of share what my next steps--because this slide really illustrates the need for us to reassess our goals for having permits out the door.",230,,
753,0.97,5903.163,5910.371,"I believe, director Torgelson, correct me if I'm wrong.",230,,
754,0.97,5910.371,5975.836,"The current benchmark is 120 days, which I believe to be too long, and for us to readjust that goal means we need to come around a table and everyone participate in changing that goal, so between now and the next permitting report that we will receive, Mr. an in my office, we would love to include you as a partner for vice chair to have a round table discussion, then a lunch and learn to present more information about permitting goals and turnaround times . The reason I would like to have this series of meetings between now and the next permitting report is because, as I stated in slide six, with all the different notes, we need to ensure the correct staffing is available on each team to ensure that there is not a roving backlog within each of those notes . director Torgelson, would you like to address that?",230,,
755,0.97,5975.836,5994.755,"We look forward to that run table, Councilmember Strauss, and getting different permit applicants at the table to discuss if we need to change those permits.",231,,
756,0.97,5994.755,5995.756,This is Andy Higgins.,232,,
757,0.97,5995.756,6001.161,I would add also we do have current goals for initial plan review for the project.,232,,
758,0.97,6001.161,6021.982,"It is 95% completion within two to four weeks, and for the complex project, it's 95% completion within 8 to 12 weeks, but those were sent a long time ago, and a 120 day clock has been set, and those are goals we're striving for.",232,,
759,0.97,6021.982,6029.823,"We are not right now meeting that goal, so the first intent is for us to get back into a paradigm where we can be meeting those goals, and the staffing influx is going to help significantly.",232,,
760,0.97,6029.823,6049.309,"If you are right, the goals are to be significantly increased, it's really a capacity question, and I would like to engage in the conversation.",232,,
761,0.97,6049.309,6052.079,"Now, we get into some of my detailed problems on this slide.",233,,
762,0.97,6052.079,6053.647,"Thank you, Anti- . that was a helpful explanation.",233,,
763,0.97,6053.647,6064.491,"What I am looking at this slide, I see average of days within Sdci in blue, an average of days elsewhere in Orange with the percentage of time in Sdci as the black line . can you help me understand who is holding the permit when it is average days elsewhere?",233,,
764,0.97,6064.491,6067.227,Is that other city departments or the permit holder themselves?,233,,
765,0.97,6067.227,6074.134,Would be the permit holder themselves.,234,,
766,0.97,6074.134,6086.48,"We use a stopped clock time similar to a chess match, where we start the clock at the obligation date, and when all required reviews are completed, we stop the clock and check it out to the applicant, and when the applicant responds and Uploads the correction responses, we start the clock again.",234,,
767,0.97,6086.48,6106.467,"We sent it back to all the required locations that did not approve there reviews and had outstanding corrections, we go through that process, stop the clock again when they are complete, and check it back out to the applicant for another round, and that goes on and on until the applicant improve their plant sets.",234,,
768,0.97,6106.467,6118.679,"We stopped the clock again, and whenever they pay for it, they automatically can pull up the permit now in our system.",234,,
769,0.97,6118.679,6133.494,It's a matter of all city departments and ownership of it is in the city's hands versus when we check it out to an applicant for responses being in their hands.,234,,
770,0.97,6133.494,6134.962,I see Darlene came off mute.,235,,
771,0.97,6134.962,6136.597,"Darlene, would you like to add anything?",235,,
772,0.97,6136.597,6140.1,"I was kind of waiting for the next slide, which is very similar to this one.",236,,
773,0.97,6140.1,6142.836,I don't know if you want to go to the next one.,236,,
774,0.97,6142.836,6146.273,But am just,236,,
775,0.97,6146.273,6153.213,"I've got a couple more thoughts on this slide which is similar to the next one, then please join.",237,,
776,0.97,6153.213,6159.92,"Andy, I guess the question here is where in this chart is it highlighted days in other departments?",237,,
777,0.97,6159.92,6163.157,Is that just included here in the blue of average days with an Sdci?,237,,
778,0.97,6163.157,6165.526,It is included in the blue.,238,,
779,0.97,6165.526,6172.933,"So the blue is all city departments, and the oranges applicants?",239,,
780,0.97,6172.933,6173.233,Correct.,240,,
781,0.97,6173.233,6188.549,"To your point, that's an indicator we only have control over what we have control over, and if another city Department ends up being Understaffed and become the bottleneck review location, that city Department ends up being the Department that controls that cycle.",240,,
782,0.97,6188.549,6196.757,We only have the ability to deal with the Sdci particulars and don't really have the authority to tell the departments what to do.,240,,
783,0.97,6196.757,6199.96,Great.,241,,
784,0.97,6199.96,6213.974,"At this time, again I have to raise up the leadership of vice chair and Councilmember Mosqueda because if it were not for the Jumpstart policy, we would be in a world of hurt in this space.",241,,
785,0.97,6213.974,6245.172,"The black line with the peak just after 2008 identifies that in the last recession, rather than passing progressive revenue, we decided to lay off city staff, and what that did was, especially within the permit world, these are highly specific and trained individuals for their roles, and so to Rehire for those positions created a backlog, which increased and created some of the delays that I believe we're experiencing today.",241,,
786,0.97,6245.172,6271.732,"So, here we are 13 years after the last recession, still experiencing some delays that were caused by laying off staff rather than retaining staff through a recession, so yesterday, the Mayor signed the Seattle rescue plan that budget chair Mosqueda and Council President champions through.",241,,
787,0.97,6271.732,6289.049,"Highlighting what I said yesterday, we would not be able to be giving money to community and small businesses and Childcare providers if we were Backfilling off our own city budget, so again, cheers to you, council member Mosqueda, for making sure that we did not repeat 2008.",241,,
788,0.97,6289.049,6311.838,"Again, a few years ago, big thank you to the Council for passing Sdci's revised fee ordinance, so when we do have that next recession, we will not have to lay off nearly as large a percentage of staff as we did back during the last recession, which will help us tremendously.",242,,
789,0.97,6311.838,6312.472,Vice chair Mosqueda?,243,,
790,0.97,6312.472,6313.14,Thank you.,244,,
791,0.97,6313.14,6316.043,I know there is other slides to get through.,244,,
792,0.97,6316.043,6324.051,"Mr. chair, thanks for the concept of pulling folks together on how to expedite Timelines.",244,,
793,0.97,6324.051,6332.059,I think one thing that would be really helpful in this post recession and that I was going to say Post-Pandemic.,244,,
794,0.97,6332.059,6333.293,We are not due to pandemic yet.,244,,
795,0.97,6333.293,6342.102,"In the wake of the last year, we should be looking at what other cities might be doing to expedite permits as well.",244,,
796,0.97,6342.102,6376.503,"I know that some places like Austin had some innovative ideas, and we were looking at them a few years ago on how to basically expedite certain types of permits, especially for projects which include housing and certain project that included a high labor Standard and high Percentagesof unionized labor for example, and projects having a pay for system that allows for folks to help address the resource issue, so I would be interested in getting feedback on what those other cities have done and if we need to be doing that now I don't want that to delay the conversation.",244,,
797,0.97,6376.503,6384.344,Let's not have paralysis by analysis here let's figure out what we need to do to expedite these processes to get construction underway so we can rebound.,244,,
798,0.97,6384.344,6396.456,"We know often with the Timeline, the figures don't include the early design guidance phase because that occurs both for and prior to the month of application.",244,,
799,0.97,6396.456,6428.488,"You have any ideas to focus on design review, which accounts for a huge piece of the entitlement process, and any other Takeaways to make sure that we are not just sort of striving for stagnation in our review Timeline, but actually expediting the process across the board, recognizing you can't control the average number of days elsewhere, just focusing on the average number of days within Sdci I think is the intent of the conversation.",244,,
800,0.97,6428.488,6430.123,"That's exactly spot on, vice chair Mosqueda.",245,,
801,0.97,6430.123,6437.497,"Actually, some research that has already been done especially on the Austin permitting process.",245,,
802,0.97,6437.497,6444.204,And we have benefited that Keto Freeman has worked with Austin as well.,245,,
803,0.97,6444.204,6456.817,I think those conversations should be held in 10 . should we move on since chair Strauss already discussed ordinances?,245,,
804,0.97,6456.817,6464.524,"And director Torgelson and Darlene, would you like to address?",245,,
805,0.97,6464.524,6472.766,This slide is pretty much the Land-Use version of the slide previous that Andy talked about.,246,,
806,0.97,6472.766,6488.014,"As far as the trends, seeing the lights in the amount of times the Department in applicant, same thing stands everything that he had mentioned I've believe pertains to master use permits as well.",246,,
807,0.97,6488.014,6505.432,"You will notice on the future slides for master use permits, the way we Divvied up the types of projects, the complex projects, the design review projects, the Sepa projects, and pretty much the simple medium projects are everything else.",246,,
808,0.97,6505.432,6543.37,"I think as far as Councilmember Mosqueda, your question about it prior to the actual application process, I know my managers who manage the sections and do the Land-Use reviews and design reviews, we know that reduce and permit times as one of our goals coming up in recognizing that and sitting down and recognizing what can we do.",246,,
809,0.97,6546.172,6556.416,"Firm UPS is a little bit different from construction and that there is processes that we can't alter, like the public notice time, the appeal time, that sort of thing, but whatever we do have control of, which would be the actual review times, and maybe when things get scheduled.",246,,
810,0.97,6556.416,6559.252,That is what we are considering sitting down where we can reduce anything.,246,,
811,0.97,6559.252,6576.937,"One of the challenges that we, frankly, have had with design review that is not as much of a challenge today is that we have, what, seven design review boards, and we had so many projects going.",247,,
812,0.97,6576.937,6599.793,"Design review, and the boards meet so many times a month, that's the amount of time they had to review the projects, projects would get shifted into the months ahead, where as now, I believe with almost all of our design review boards, projects are able to go to the board when they're ready pretty much immediately, just because there are fewer projects, so in some ways, that is not good news.",247,,
813,0.97,6599.793,6609.369,"If there were fewer coming in, but those projects are able to get to the board much faster.",247,,
814,0.97,6609.369,6613.907,That is another issue we have to look at it I think we also have to take a look at the threshold.,247,,
815,0.97,6613.907,6621.748,Do we need to change or review thresholds?,247,,
816,0.97,6621.748,6629.089,"Vice chair, does that answer your questions?",248,,
817,0.97,6629.089,6646.172,"I have all sorts of questions how we can bypass some of the process and create pathways, especially given the emergency declarations that happen put off that had allowed us to do that and many other areas, and something that you are considering as well, Mr.",249,,
818,0.97,6646.172,6646.973,"Chair, and director Torgelson.",249,,
819,0.97,6646.973,6649.676,We think of the permitting process that will allow for additional housing.,249,,
820,0.97,6649.676,6671.631,"Is there a shorter Timeline for the notice, and is there a shorter Timeline, or could we just bypass the design review requirements, given the urgency of restarting the economy and more importantly, housing folks.",249,,
821,0.97,6671.631,6677.103,"Right now, during the Covid emergency, affordable housing projects are not going through design review.",250,,
822,0.97,6677.103,6678.505,I just mean housing as well.,251,,
823,0.97,6678.505,6679.939,"Housing in general, Yeah.",252,,
824,0.97,6679.939,6683.643,Yeah.,253,,
825,0.97,6683.643,6698.425,"More to come, I suppose, but obviously, a big concern . We did a little bit of work, as you noted, to shorten some of those Timelines and other areas in previous years, but maybe that also needs to be reviewed.",253,,
826,0.97,6698.425,6698.825,Yes.,254,,
827,0.97,6698.825,6705.765,"I will say yes to that . Thank you, vice chair.",254,,
828,0.97,6705.765,6707.767,"So, this is Andy Higgins again.",255,,
829,0.97,6707.767,6729.489,"This chart is basically showing a year and a half or so of history and what days from permit application and issuance Timelines have been, and it is showing even through the March and post go home, work from home world indicated that this is really a state relatively flat.",255,,
830,0.97,6729.489,6752.979,"What we that even with our initial plan review Timelines, as we brought on new staff, we actually had them taking on corrections cycle reviews, so we're not relying on them to do the entire initial review, but they are learning by taking on the correction reviews that someone else had been working with that reviewer to make sure all the issues have been ironed out, so we are Ramping people up to speed.",255,,
831,0.97,6752.979,6771.397,"This is basically saying the type our hand has been relatively flat, and the time in the applicant's hands has in some way been increasing because a lot of those projects have been marinating, especially the larger project that have funding issues . You are right.",255,,
832,0.97,6771.397,6792.585,"There are other issues outside of our control from a lending perspective that are causing other projects to sit in the system and not want to get issued because once they get issued, they've got an 18 month window that the permit is good, and if they don't start to work within that window, they are subject to compliance . There are other factors that go into that, but relatively over the last year, things have been consistent.",255,,
833,0.97,6792.585,6823.049,"Same thing with correction cycles here the top chart indicates on the right that it takes roughly three or so correction cycles together on average on civil and medium construction permits, and for complex, it is closer to four, and the goal is to try to reduce that so there's better clarity, better collaboration on solutions, and an ability to reduce correction cycles.",255,,
834,0.97,6823.049,6833.56,"We feel that the Combinaton of reducing our initial plan review and being able to meet our current targets in the first place, as well as being able to reduce the number of correction cycles needed will a couple what you are trying to accomplish.",255,,
835,0.97,6833.56,6835.061,I have one other know.,255,,
836,0.97,6835.061,6842.702,Sorry to interrupt . There was a comment on the previous couple of slides about paying for expediting.,255,,
837,0.97,6842.702,6865.692,"We did run a racial equity Toolkit against that about 15 years ago and decided that it was really not equitable to allow people that did have the resources to pay for expediting to allow them to get through the system faster than those that did not have the ability to pay for expediting, so we've made a policy choice over many, many years to not allow that for that exact reason.",255,,
838,0.97,6865.692,6905.231,"We have had agreements with parties outside the city to add additional funding for staffing, and I think that that has helped improve the throughput of the entire system, which I believe is a more equitable solution, and I believe, Councilmember Strauss, that is what your intent may be, to increase our capacity over all and our depth of capacity to deal with those constraints that arise from time to time and cause bottlenecks to shift from one review location to another so that all review locations are able to review effectively and keep our throughput flow in.",255,,
839,0.97,6905.231,6906.065,"Yes, vice chair.",256,,
840,0.97,6906.065,6908.134,"Please keep going, and I've got questions once you're done.",256,,
841,0.97,6908.134,6911.771,"Thank you, Andy.",257,,
842,0.97,6911.771,6913.673,For the history on that from 15 years ago.,257,,
843,0.97,6913.673,6916.276,I did not know we were using racial equity tools.,257,,
844,0.97,6916.276,6950.977,"I think the question I would still have is are there other cities using some sort of pay for model with an equity lens with a social justice lens, so if the project is going towards building housing or if a project uses a high number of good living wage jobs, if it is creating or using green building standards, or something along those lines to actually get Abby underlying racial social justice issues we're trying to address during the city.",257,,
845,0.97,6950.977,6954.447,"15 years ago, we did not have the 20% increase and the decade span in our population.",257,,
846,0.97,6954.447,6985.878,"We were in a declared state of emergency, so maybe there is something's happening now post Covid that can still help us expedite, and I also don't think it is a simple pay for model that's equitable, but if there is things we can do to help bring in additional staff or exploit certain types of projects, that might be helpful as long as it is not increasing the weight for other projects as well . looking for to work with you on that, but I appreciate the background, and I want to think about if there's a way we can look at the type of projects, especially given the urgency right now of Covid and small businesses remaining open, et cetera.",257,,
847,0.97,6985.878,6990.984,We can share our Prioritization guideline in place.,258,,
848,0.97,6990.984,7002.862,"We already Prioritize affordable housing projects and school projects and, you know, shelter projects and things like that that to get different levels of Prioritization.",258,,
849,0.97,7002.862,7003.73,That would be helpful.,259,,
850,0.97,7003.73,7007.867,"I do have that broken down by the time, like project that have housing, projects that are for small businesses?",259,,
851,0.97,7007.867,7009.635,Could we see that type of delineation?,259,,
852,0.97,7009.635,7010.336,Yes.,260,,
853,0.97,7010.336,7011.771,Okay.,261,,
854,0.97,7011.771,7012.739,Wonderful.,262,,
855,0.97,7012.739,7014.24,Thank you.,262,,
856,0.97,7014.24,7027.387,"And my questions here, I guess this slide with the master use permit and simple and medium permits, both slides work well for the question I have here.",262,,
857,0.97,7027.387,7044.971,"Just to understand when we were speaking Earlierabout goals and you were noting that for I believe simple and medium permits, the goal for turnaround is two to four weeks, and for complex, it is 8 to 12 weeks?",262,,
858,0.97,7044.971,7045.972,"8 to 12, correct.",263,,
859,0.97,7045.972,7049.208,"I am still not even using my notes, teach.",264,,
860,0.97,7049.208,7049.675,Good job.,265,,
861,0.97,7049.675,7072.532,"[Laughter] so, I think what is important to note here and part of the conversation about reassessing goals is that those goals are just for what are oftentimes the first correction cycle, and then for the overall goal of having the permit process 120 days is to include all correction cycles.",266,,
862,0.97,7072.532,7096.823,"I think that is something that can be confusing and needs to be addressed . What I did hear you say, and let me make sure I heard it correctly, is with the blue beam software now being implemented, you're able to make real time and that you're able to give real-time feedback, rather than waiting for correction cycles . is that the case, and using that will reduce the correction cycles?",266,,
863,0.97,7096.823,7098.257,It has capability to do that.,267,,
864,0.97,7098.257,7098.491,Yes.,267,,
865,0.97,7098.491,7112.738,That is not part of our initial limitation because it would only be applicable for a small set of projects where it would add value.,267,,
866,0.97,7112.738,7141.367,"If we tried to do a Pre- Resubmittal conference on every application, that would really bog down a lot of the system, so where there is really complex issues or larger projects or project that needs a little more Handholding to get through some of the challenging issues that they are faced, we do have the opportunity to potentially do that as part of the blue beam studio package, but initially what we're trying to do is really Replicate or replace what we have in our focused tool and enhance our opportunity to collaborate within that single tool and allow us to try to reduce correction cycles via that initially.",267,,
867,0.97,7141.367,7142.201,"Okay, great.",268,,
868,0.97,7142.201,7151.277,Just want to make sure . and what strategies--and maybe this is better for the round table conversation.,268,,
869,0.97,7151.277,7160.92,Du at the top of your head have more strategies that you can implement during these correction cycles?,268,,
870,0.97,7160.92,7168.494,I think our biggest one is trying to be as clear as possible on what are the required corrections and how to comply with the code.,269,,
871,0.97,7168.494,7180.239,"At the end of the day, our job is to point out areas where the application isn't in compliance or substantial compliance with the code, and it's incumbent on the applicant to substantially apply to the code.",269,,
872,0.97,7180.239,7196.222,"If we could get complaints faster through a cycle, we'll be able to get issuance faster overall . that is the key to me, that the Cycling is really problematic, and the averages sometimes don't show that in there.",269,,
873,0.97,7196.222,7234.86,"Sometimes, we have other charts that show one to three cycles and you are very responsive to your application corrections, you're going to get to the permit process in a much shorter period of time, whether if it takes you four to five cycles, am I double that time nine or six cycle, it may triple the Timeline . The average is one way to look at it, but there's a large number of our projects that do go through in one to three cycles and get issues much, much more quickly versus the ones that take four to five to six cycles or more who are either [Laughter] I don't how to explain why you take that sometimes.",269,,
874,0.97,7234.86,7250.009,"Sometimes it's challenging issues, sometimes lack of responsiveness from the applicant's . Sometimes it is just a challenge to the question being asked, so that is where we want to focus on.",269,,
875,0.97,7250.009,7252.511,"Finding solutions, and getting through those faster, and getting to issuance quickly.",269,,
876,0.97,7252.511,7253.713,Thank you.,270,,
877,0.97,7253.713,7263.623,Those are all my questions for this slide.,270,,
878,0.97,7263.623,7266.325,So this slide is really indicative of that initial plan review.,271,,
879,0.97,7266.325,7276.836,"Target Timeline, this shows him a Timeline of about the beginning of 2019 after we went live with the seller, the availability to meet with our initial Timeline targets at the 95% level.",271,,
880,0.97,7276.836,7288.981,"You can see as we got into 2020 in the middle of this chart through about July 2020, we actually were able to get up there and achieve those targets fairly consistently.",271,,
881,0.97,7288.981,7303.429,"We did not really have a reporting in place until about the middle of 2019, so you can see from the middle 2019 and bill of 2020, having that reporting in place and being able to have the staffing in place to get those reviews completed . We were able to get up there.",271,,
882,0.97,7303.429,7327.687,"As the middle of 2020 hit and we started to feel the attrition from retirements and we were not able to Backfill the terminated positions because is going to take a six month term limited in a pandemic as a job? you know, that has really dropped off to today, and I think we have gotten ahead of that tiered we are bringing on new audience reviewers, and we've only got them on board and in place training them up.",271,,
883,0.97,7327.687,7355.214,"Starting today, we've actually got two new Geotechnical engineers that are starting, so that's going to add capacity in that potential bottleneck location, and we're also recruiting for two additional and a third position that we lost through attrition . This is, I feel like possibly the worst point Unfortunately reporting out today.",271,,
884,0.97,7355.214,7362.221,"It does not feel good to say that, but I will say going forward, it does look better in terms of as we bring on additional capacity in the current bottleneck review locations.",271,,
885,0.97,7362.221,7364.724,That will be in a better state three to six months from now.,271,,
886,0.97,7364.724,7365.991,This is Nathan Torgelson.,272,,
887,0.97,7365.991,7372.732,"The fire Department brought on a new plan to review as well, which should help significantly in that area.",272,,
888,0.97,7372.732,7373.799,Thank you.,273,,
889,0.97,7373.799,7390.049,"You addressed on that last slide, you addressed many of the aspects to my question of what created the situations for us not meeting our goals.",273,,
890,0.97,7390.049,7392.051,Is there anything else you would like to add?,273,,
891,0.97,7392.051,7394.253,It sounds like staffing and technology have been the main drivers.,273,,
892,0.97,7394.253,7399.959,Is there anything else I need to know?,273,,
893,0.97,7399.959,7409.368,"Of getting ultimately, it's a capacity question at this point and making sure all the review locations have enough capacity to deal with the demands that are in place currently.",273,,
894,0.97,7409.368,7433.192,"The vesting rushes another one of those things where we're getting toward the tail end of working through those applications I came in, in March, and as the number of applications has softened since that time, I believe we'll also be catching up just due to the fact that the man is going down and capacity is going up, so when that happens, I believe we're going to get closer and closer to our target a few times.",273,,
895,0.97,7433.192,7447.873,That I also hear you say the time or the term limited positions did not previously been converted to permanent positions?,274,,
896,0.97,7447.873,7448.274,Yes.,275,,
897,0.97,7448.274,7454.38,"Thankfully, you all approved the budget for 2021, where we asked to have that all converted from term limited positions to regular, ongoing funded positions for building plans Examiners.",275,,
898,0.97,7454.38,7484.877,"I believe we had five or six pockets and a supervisor pocket that were all term limited ending at the end of 2020, and we had had those for a number of years that we initially requested through the budget authority back in 2016-Ish, I Thnk, so I think it's really difficult to recruit with a term limited tag on it when you put that recruitment out there because people look at that like it is a Temp job, so it is difficult recruit for those, so the better, the more able we are to get regularly funded positions, knowing that nothing is permanent.",275,,
899,0.97,7484.877,7500.759,"Layoffs can happen if revenue goes to the floor and, you know, everyone is aware of that, but just having that tag of term limit make it very, very difficult for agreements.",275,,
900,0.97,7500.759,7504.864,"Being able to go forward, we were able to bring on a strong group of folks the last few months.",275,,
901,0.97,7504.864,7513.305,Another aspect of budget chair Mosqueda's leadership.,276,,
902,0.97,7513.305,7514.173,Helping you out already.,276,,
903,0.97,7514.173,7519.044,Maybe we can talk about this during the round table.,276,,
904,0.97,7519.044,7532.591,"Just for the viewing public, what you believe needs to happen for us to change the goals, so whether that is the 120-day goal, order or the 4 and 12-Week goals.",276,,
905,0.97,7532.591,7575.568,"That is a question of what looks good, what does good look like, and defining that from an applicant's perspective in your perspective and saying, you know, what makes sense, and being able to have enough capacity to meet those goals and meeting them in every review location because when we bring in an application, it's got to get to every single review location before it gets checked out to the applicant, so any particular relocation that ends up becoming that bottleneck end up becoming the challenge, but at some point, you can only add so much too, and if there's diminishing return and a huge risk of over staffing as well, it's about trying to find that balance of what is good look like and what does it take to get there consistently.",277,,
906,0.97,7575.568,7583.108,Thank you.,278,,
907,0.97,7583.108,7596.655,"I think this is just kind of a Reiteration of the number of cycles and what may be causing the complexity of code regulation, lower quality cemented plans because of just everybody being so busy.",279,,
908,0.97,7596.655,7610.669,"New city staff who tend to sort of cover their own butts when they start out initially, write more questions than necessary because they don't want to Miss something . We train them out.",279,,
909,0.97,7610.669,7617.71,"We try to get them past that as soon as possible and not have that happen, but it is a reality.",279,,
910,0.97,7617.71,7640.032,"And then, you know, as projects come back in the door, we have shorter target times for Re- reviewing this project than the initial review periods themselves, so we tracked initial plan review most closely, and the Timelines around meeting those targets, but it also has an impact on cycle reviews as well and how long projects in the review per cycle cues, once they come back in the door for corrections.",279,,
911,0.97,7640.032,7645.904,"Like I said, we try to get those done and out the door faster, but when a review location becomes a bottleneck, they only have so much capacity.",279,,
912,0.97,7645.904,7655.914,"It is not only reducing initial plan review, but it's also reducing correction time and looking at the whole in order to reduce.",279,,
913,0.97,7655.914,7656.515,Thank you.,280,,
914,0.97,7656.515,7693.252,"I think in the next presentation we have in September, it will be really helpful for me to understand the difference between other departments in Sdci's role because as the Department of construction and inspections, your whole job is making sure that we get these permits out the door, and I know you have a very intense focus on this, so other departments don't have that same goal in their Department to issue permits, so I just want to make sure that we're giving them the resources that they need to be successful as well.",280,,
915,0.97,7693.252,7697.823,"So, this is Nathan.",281,,
916,0.97,7697.823,7705.431,"Looking to the rest of 2021 and into 2022, obviously our key priority is to make reductions in our permitting times.",281,,
917,0.97,7705.431,7714.873,We have learned a lot through coded . We know that we have been able to work fairly successfully virtually.,281,,
918,0.97,7714.873,7725.484,One of the things that we want to do is stand up a virtual applicant center so someone does not have to come downtown.,281,,
919,0.97,7725.484,7731.056,They can get on a screen like this and talk to an Sdci staff person in our applicant service center.,281,,
920,0.97,7731.056,7748.707,We have looked at the possibility of having in prison services at Non-Downtown locations if it is really important for a person to have face-to-face contact with someone . that can perhaps be at a Seattle public library branch location.,281,,
921,0.97,7748.707,7764.89,"Again, we want to resume all our standard services . Our rental registration inspection ordinance inspections have been on pause during coded, and we know that we will resume those services.",281,,
922,0.97,7764.89,7791.917,"And finally, you know, we talked about the importance of reducing permitted times, but we also continue to work on improving our customer experience, and part of that comes with technology changes that and he talked about and are highlighted in a slide coming up.",281,,
923,0.97,7791.917,7810.269,"So this slide is showing what the project valuations were over the course of 2019, 2020, and 2021 . You saw spike and December of 2020, then January and March of 2021.",282,,
924,0.97,7810.269,7826.585,Each of those really is around what was going to be the code adoption date of the 2018 construction codes.,282,,
925,0.97,7826.585,7831.29,"Initially, it was July 1ST, so we had a number of projects shooting to get in at June, since they were ready to go.",282,,
926,0.97,7831.29,7833.792,A lot of them carried forward and kept going with those.,282,,
927,0.97,7833.792,7848.173,"Then the date shifted I believe to November, so October, we saw it was some thought around end of year, but it landed with March 15th, and that was a little bit different than the state conversation.",282,,
928,0.97,7848.173,7854.079,"In that whole period of time, we had a number of project that we were going to play later in 2021, rush in, and get ahead of those changes.",282,,
929,0.97,7854.079,7866.291,"So we have seen a number of those bumps in valuation, but you can also see that the volume has maintained a fairly consistent time in March of last year.",282,,
930,0.97,7866.291,7868.36,"Of course, there was a dip primarily in smaller projects.",282,,
931,0.97,7868.36,7898.69,"The volume of projects we get that are in small to medium is roughly 80% to 85% of our total volume, versus accomplished projects which is more of that 15% to 20%, but they are much higher value projects, so you can tell after the pandemic hit, things shut down, a lot of those small projects hit the brakes and did not proceed right away, but as things started to reopen backup in the summer, those volumes came back up.",282,,
932,0.97,7898.69,7900.459,"That is fairly consistent, even through a recession.",282,,
933,0.97,7900.459,7919.544,"We often NOTE our evaluation of permits drops much more significantly than the volume of permits in the 2008 risk action, valuation dropped by 50%, which is why we ended up experiencing so many layoffs as we did not have a significant enough core staffing Reserve in place, which we do now.",282,,
934,0.97,7919.544,7924.283,The volume of permits remained at about an 80% tick.,282,,
935,0.97,7924.283,7953.812,"So even though the volume state high and the valuation and revenue declined significantly, we still have a high value of permits coming in through the system, which is why we need to maintain staffing and, even during town concerns, so we're anticipating economic recovery, we want to be able to have trained staff fully effective in place so we are helping to facilitate that economic Úrecovery rather than being a roadblock to that, so we definitely appreciate the ability now to have that core staffing.",282,,
936,0.97,7953.812,7956.682,"Thank you, and you actually answered all the questions I prepared.",283,,
937,0.97,7956.682,7965.924,"Just highlighting the upward ticks when many permits are trying to come through, desperate for new code and limitation.",283,,
938,0.97,7965.924,7973.098,"And if that does not happen with the appropriate staff, can you create a wave of delay.",283,,
939,0.97,7973.098,7982.607,"Thank you, Andy.",283,,
940,0.97,7982.607,7984.843,This is Darlene again.,284,,
941,0.97,7984.843,8012.938,"So this slide pretty much shows the application intake for the last three years, and it has definitely slowed, so it is summer, but it has been steady since of September last year till now, and I just pointed out that January was probably our lowest month with 38 applications, then April this year was our highest month with 60.",284,,
942,0.97,8012.938,8014.973,How this is different from the flight for construction intake?,284,,
943,0.97,8014.973,8026.885,"We don't have valuation information because we don't look at project value at application, so this is strictly application numbers.",284,,
944,0.97,8026.885,8031.456,I think something I mentioned before is something steady but does not show on here.,284,,
945,0.97,8031.456,8045.103,"We always have a steady amount of outside divisions come in, and that is due partly to whenever we issue Townhouse permits or roadhouse permits, typically it comes after that.",284,,
946,0.97,8045.103,8049.408,That is one of our steady streams.,284,,
947,0.97,8049.408,8051.81,I was thinking about this.,284,,
948,0.97,8051.81,8057.816,Maybe we can talk about this later.,284,,
949,0.97,8057.816,8088.447,"I don't know if this slide could be more helpful or valuable or if maybe it showed the complex and simple and medium, just so you can get an idea of the size of the projects coming in because this is the application . If you think that could be valuable, we can have our economist going.",284,,
950,0.97,8088.447,8090.382,That will be available for the next presentation.,285,,
951,0.97,8090.382,8091.817,We can turn back today or July.,285,,
952,0.97,8091.817,8098.423,Thank you.,286,,
953,0.97,8098.423,8100.926,This is all the trade permits.,287,,
954,0.97,8100.926,8107.666,"Again, this is Nathan, boiler, electrical, side permits whatsoever.",287,,
955,0.97,8107.666,8120.078,"You can see trade minutes have returned to Pre-Pandemic volumes, so definitely back on track there.",287,,
956,0.97,8120.078,8130.889,"In our Premeeting briefing, I asked the question, and he described it a little bit . can you expand a little bit on what our trade permits as compared to building permits?",288,,
957,0.97,8130.889,8158.517,"Trade permits again are things like boiler pressure, valve permits, electrical permits, sign and Awning permits, Conveyance permits which are elevators, which we inspect both new elevators and on an annual basis every year for safety reasons, refrigeration permits, electrical permits, that type of a permit.",289,,
958,0.97,8158.517,8163.488,"Great, so this is more of the life of the building rather?",290,,
959,0.97,8163.488,8171.897,It is both.,291,,
960,0.97,8171.897,8175.834,Thank you.,292,,
961,0.97,8175.834,8180.739,We have three slides left.,293,,
962,0.97,8180.739,8181.84,This is Andy again.,294,,
963,0.97,8181.84,8184.91,I can touch on this again.,294,,
964,0.97,8184.91,8191.516,"This has to do with our Seattle services portal that went live I believe earlier this month, I want to say the 10th of June.",294,,
965,0.97,8191.516,8213.672,"What happened here is we had an external research company come in and do some experience research for us, survey our applicants, and how much we can do to better enhance your experience on the public portal and get better information from the portal itself, and we took all that feedback and worked with Seattle I.T.",294,,
966,0.97,8213.672,8224.149,Closely to update the Seattle services records.,294,,
967,0.97,8224.149,8238.063,"My records page, which is the page you search all your current applications and status and to dos and all those things either in the city's hands or fees needing to be paid or corrections needed to be responded to our permits needed to be issued, et cetera.",294,,
968,0.97,8238.063,8240.098,This is just a Screenshot of that Seattle services portal.,294,,
969,0.97,8240.098,8246.104,"A little hard to see in the upper left-hand corner, but you can see it says Seattle services portal there.",294,,
970,0.97,8246.104,8248.006,This is what is known as a heat map.,294,,
971,0.97,8248.006,8303.395,"Many people have never seen this before, but those familiar with it will know that the broader the areas, the more clicks there are on those areas, and you will notice on the upper left-hand corner, the home page and my records tab in the farthest to upper left which are White-Hot and Red-Hot colored, and secondarily, you will notice along the middle kind of a band that looks almost like a streak or comment across the upper third point of that slide, and really what those are our new filters that we have put in so that when someone enters their name or their address or anything that they are associated with, they can start filtering their projects by that, so they log into their portal account, all the product they are associated with will show up in the records list, and they can filter by status, so if something is ready to be issued or fees need to be paid or they just want to look up history, it's all there.",294,,
972,0.97,8303.395,8310.368,"We've got a lot of great feedback about this, but this is an example of the ongoing work we're doing to improve that user experience.",294,,
973,0.97,8310.368,8347.405,"One great feedback we got is a very large major downtown property owner, and their property manager had over 300 permits that they were tracking for their properties, and the majority of those were trade permits and street use permits, and they would have to create their own spreadsheet just to track those different permits, and now with these enhancements, they just go to one screen . It saves a tremendous amount of time.",295,,
974,0.97,8347.405,8348.573,"So, next slide.",295,,
975,0.97,8348.573,8363.555,"Shaping Seattle . As you recall, shaping Seattle Debuted several years ago, and this is an easy way to get on the map and click on a blue DOT and see a project.",295,,
976,0.97,8363.555,8383.808,"A lot of people don't know the project address, but they can't go on a map . We had to take shaping Seattle down for a while while he improved the Skunk knowledge it, but it came back to include all mastery permits, all building permits.",295,,
977,0.97,8383.808,8396.955,"We have now added all code complaint files to this, and we're also working to bring all the rental registration inspection ordinance sites into shaping Seattle as well.",295,,
978,0.97,8396.955,8410.168,"This is a fantastic tool for staff and public that continues to expand, and again, you can press one of those blue dots, and all the relevant information comes up.",295,,
979,0.97,8410.168,8415.306,"To add to that, shaping Seattle is also a work in progress.",296,,
980,0.97,8415.306,8431.356,"This currently exists to show all active applications and active permits, but our desire is to also enhance this and further include permit history as well and all past issue permits and final permits as well.",296,,
981,0.97,8431.356,8434.259,"That is kind of the next step, but somewhere, we will look at it.",296,,
982,0.97,8434.259,8456.781,"That will be a huge improvement because there are a lot of members of the public or applicants that need to do permit research, and they have to physically come down to the Seattle municipal tower and go through our microphone records, where now during the pandemic, they need to Email staff and have staff get those documents, so that could save a considerable amount of time for public.",297,,
983,0.97,8456.781,8477.235,"Coupled with that, we're in the process of converting all that microphone and Micro feed into electric Donica make system, so they will all be electronically accessible in single places, so that is a good thing.",298,,
984,0.97,8477.235,8479.337,So this is Nathan again.,299,,
985,0.97,8479.337,8492.05,"We went through a lot of these in previous discussion, just about our new hires to support permit review.",299,,
986,0.97,8492.05,8510.134,One additional ad here we did not cover before is we have just hired two new process improvement and technology managers that will really help us with our continuous improvement and our strategic technology planning and our customer service because we know that technology is the background of everything that we do at Sdci.,299,,
987,0.97,8510.134,8536.528,I just wanted to throw out some other ideas for you all to think about how we can improve permitting.,299,,
988,0.97,8536.528,8540.064,"I know this will be of special interest to you, Councilmember Strauss, and to you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",299,,
989,0.97,8540.064,8561.019,"The Sepa process, it does take time, and Sepa projects can be appealed, Sepa projects are important to neighborhoods because it does provide public comment process and an appeal process if the community is unhappy with the project, but Sepa thresholds could be raised for projects outside urban villages, and Sepa thresholds could be raised for commercial projects . I am just throwing that out there.",299,,
990,0.97,8561.019,8602.26,"Also, there are I think changes that we can make to our design review program to make that faster . As part of the Sepa process, we often have to do traffic studies for the state Sepa regulations, but in any case, we don't have the ability to acquire mitigation, so that could be frustrating for neighborhoods and for the developer that had to go to the expense of doing the traffic study, but then we don't have the authority or Wherewithal to require mitigation for any traffic impacts that are identified . that was an issue.",299,,
991,0.97,8602.26,8606.931,I know I have raised this many times.,299,,
992,0.97,8606.931,8610.835,"My staff are getting tired of me talking about it, but the land use code is over 1000 pages long.",299,,
993,0.97,8610.835,8611.703,It is very complicated.,299,,
994,0.97,8611.703,8616.975,"It is frustrating for the public, for staff, and for our applicants.",299,,
995,0.97,8616.975,8623.247,That is really challenging and a long-term project to try to improve that land use code.,299,,
996,0.97,8623.247,8628.987,I think it is something that we need to tackle.,299,,
997,0.97,8628.987,8635.593,"Thank you, and well noted.",300,,

1015,0.97,8770.828,8793.851,"The importance of this racial equity Toolkit was so that we could have a clear understanding of how our existing zoning policies are either furthering and contributing to discriminatory zoning practices, pushing people out of the city, and creating an inequitable housing situation, or whether they were meeting the goals.",306,,
