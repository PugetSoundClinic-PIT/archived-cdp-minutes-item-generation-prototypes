72,0.97,508.274,511.31,You can't hold their hand.,17,,
73,0.97,511.31,521.287,"And to see your child not just, this is your child, the person you brought into the world, even though she was an adult.",17,,
74,0.97,521.287,527.226,"She has three children, but that's still your baby.",17,,
75,0.97,527.226,537.103,"And Harry, Okay, I thank your family and thank you for being a support for Alexis too.",17,,
76,0.97,537.103,538.437,Mickey was our oldest.,17,,
77,0.97,538.437,544.11,She was the one who made us parents at the beginning.,17,,
78,0.97,544.11,551.517,"With her being so much older, she was the type person that she checked on everybody.",17,,
79,0.97,551.517,559.425,"She, by her being the first grandchild, the first girl, she checked on everybody.",17,,
80,0.97,559.425,563.162,"She, the aunts, the uncles, the grandparents.",17,,
81,0.97,563.162,567.099,"She made sure even when she was ill, she made sure they were looked after.",17,,
82,0.97,567.099,569.168,She would say we have to go see them.,17,,
83,0.97,569.168,571.771,And she would call them up.,17,,
84,0.97,571.771,587.52,"And then she, as she got older in grade school we had moved to California, and her friend, she had made friends with this little girl, but their family didn't have much, so it was school time, and Mickey goes.",17,,
85,0.97,587.52,592.391,"I can't go to school, I said what do you mean.",17,,
86,0.97,592.391,601.467,"She says my friend, her parents couldn't Bye her, didn't have the capability of buying her shoes or clothes to start school.",17,,
87,0.97,601.467,611.777,"So in order for her to go to school, my husband and I said, well I guess we have to buy the little girl some, you know we bought her some clothes and school.",17,,
88,0.97,611.777,618.718,And then her mother didn't have the resources to wash the clothes and we had just bought a washer and drier.,17,,
89,0.97,618.718,622.588,So we washed the clothes and Fed the family.,17,,
90,0.97,622.588,627.626,But this was her way of doing throughout her life.,17,,
91,0.97,627.626,629.195,Even as an adult.,17,,
92,0.97,629.195,636.635,"When she had three children, she did the same.",17,,
93,0.97,636.635,643.576,"Everybody, everybody knew one thing, Maryanne Mickey, you could Bo there and you would find she would feed you.",17,,
94,0.97,643.576,646.712,She would take care of you.,17,,
95,0.97,646.712,649.749,She worked for a children's center.,17,,
96,0.97,649.749,654.453,"And she would call me, mom, there's nobody for this child.",17,,
97,0.97,654.453,661.293,So in working for that children's center we would end up buying things for this one little girl.,17,,
98,0.97,661.293,667.133,"And she would bring them home and we would have, and we would feed them.",17,,
99,0.97,667.133,667.5,And everything.,17,,
100,0.97,667.5,669.835,But this was her life.,17,,
101,0.97,669.835,673.873,"This was the way she, she was.",17,,
102,0.97,673.873,680.98,"And her friends Miss her, her children definitely Miss her.",17,,
103,0.97,680.98,683.816,"And I and her dad, we're devastated.",17,,
104,0.97,683.816,687.92,Because how do you get through this.,17,,
105,0.97,687.92,695.294,"When we were on a zoom call, and you see your loved one, drift away.",17,,
106,0.97,695.294,695.795,And we didn't know.,17,,
107,0.97,695.795,697.463,We were happy.,17,,
108,0.97,697.463,700.633,We were thinking she's getting better.,17,,
109,0.97,700.633,702.868,"And the nurse said, no.",17,,
110,0.97,702.868,703.169,She wasn't.,17,,
111,0.97,703.169,714.18,"And then this time all I can say for anyone, please get the vaccine.",17,,
112,0.97,714.18,716.148,"Wear your mask, Wash your hands.",17,,
113,0.97,716.148,729.395,"Because to see your loved one leave us on a zoom--I mean, and even when we went to see her in, at the funeral home.",17,,
114,0.97,729.395,732.865,She couldn't even touch her then.,17,,
115,0.97,732.865,737.803,Because she was so sick and this is how this disease did.,17,,
116,0.97,737.803,742.508,So I thank you all.,17,,
117,0.97,742.508,749.949,And I pray for all the other people in not only in Seattle but the entire world.,17,,
118,0.97,749.949,758.29,Because it is the most devastating thing I've ever seen.,17,,
119,0.97,758.29,758.657,But thank you.,17,,
120,0.97,758.657,766.499,It's one of the most hideous diseases that you have to deal with.,18,,
121,0.97,766.499,769.735,We were truly truly devastated by this.,18,,
122,0.97,769.735,782.014,"We're still trying to rebound and I don't know if we'll ever rebound because in the order of things, it's supposed to be the parents, my children are supposed to bury us.",18,,
123,0.97,782.014,787.052,"And not us have to, you know bury our child.",18,,
124,0.97,787.052,799.231,"So it's been devastating but, we are going to get through it with the grace of God and we're just going to be pray for it and we're going to try to go through this whole situation as best we can.",18,,
125,0.97,799.231,801.667,We appreciate everything you folks are doing.,18,,
126,0.97,801.667,802.368,This proclamation.,18,,
127,0.97,802.368,805.905,It gives us a lot of encouragement.,18,,
128,0.97,805.905,814.079,It really helps us to go on and deal with this situation that we have to deal with.,18,,
129,0.97,814.079,819.351,And truly truly is Impacting but we are trying to go on and embrace it.,18,,
130,0.97,819.351,824.056,And go forward in life because she would want us to do that.,18,,
131,0.97,824.056,828.294,Our daughter was that kind of person that she wouldn't want us to be sad.,18,,
132,0.97,828.294,831.53,She would want us to go on and go forward.,18,,
133,0.97,831.53,836.869,And we're trying to do that as parents but it's really hard.,18,,
134,0.97,836.869,843.042,"And I realize that the death toll is 500,000 plus.",18,,
135,0.97,843.042,844.944,So we're not the only one.,18,,
136,0.97,844.944,849.849,There's other people that are embracing this same type of hardship.,18,,
137,0.97,849.849,859.959,But we just happened to be so thankful that you all are doing this proclamation for us and we thank every one that is doing this.,18,,
138,0.97,859.959,861.427,I would like to add on.,19,,
139,0.97,861.427,865.03,And I will send it to her girls.,19,,
140,0.97,865.03,867.399,They're all trying to Recoop.,19,,
141,0.97,867.399,870.87,They themselves have children.,19,,
142,0.97,870.87,874.473,So Maryanne and Mickey has grandchildren also.,19,,
143,0.97,874.473,876.308,Which makes us great grandparents.,19,,
144,0.97,876.308,882.581,So it's a lot of people that will be very thankful for this.,19,,

256,0.97,1526.458,1532.931,Our biggest public health challenges untreated mental health and chronic drug abuse are completely missing from the work program.,39,,
257,0.97,1532.931,1544.209,Addressing these issues should be of the highest priority since they're the primary underlying causes of inhumane and Encampments in our streets and in our parks.,39,,
