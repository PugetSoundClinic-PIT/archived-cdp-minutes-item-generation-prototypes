332,0.97,1640.739,1654.386,I will first turn it over the Jasmine from the office of labor standards to walk us through what we are appointing folks to to today.,64,,
333,0.97,1654.519,1688.253,"[Indiscernible] as you may recall the domestic workers standards board is committed to improving the working conditions of domestic workers by providing a place for workers, employers, organizations and the public.",64,,
334,0.97,1688.253,1695.627,The board typically consists of about half workers or their representatives and half hiring entities or their representatives.,64,,

343,0.97,1755.086,1768.566,Also before that I want to note that--the board is also excited that both Gonzalez and Liz Hunter-Keller are able and willing to serve on the board for another term.,64,,
344,0.97,1768.566,1799.097,She is the Co-Chair of the Dwsb and has been very active in the board and active generally as an Organizer and also continues to work as domestic worker and as a House cleaner and is just--has been an amazing presence on the board and as many on you recall was instrumental in advocacy around the domestic worker's ordinance a few years ago.,64,,

350,0.97,1834.299,1840.171,I know they are excited to partner with the Council to refine recommendations and move the work forward.,64,,
351,0.97,1840.171,1844.909,So I guess we can turn it over to --,64,,
352,0.97,1844.909,1845.677,That sounds great.,65,,
353,0.97,1845.677,1851.115,We will start with Steve Hooper and then our hope is that Marie will be with us on the line as well.,65,,
354,0.97,1851.115,1856.054,I know that--it sounds like she was here earlier and we may have accidentally lost some connection.,65,,
355,0.97,1856.054,1862.727,We will double check to see if we can get her back into the stream here.,65,,
356,0.97,1862.727,1869.5,"With that, Steve, it is great to see you again.",65,,
357,0.97,1869.5,1874.772,Thank you for all of your work over the years.,65,,
358,0.97,1874.772,1880.011,Excited about your interest and serving on the committee.,65,,
359,0.97,1880.011,1887.619,Could you tell us more about your back ground and what you like to do while serving on the board?,65,,
360,0.97,1887.619,1889.687,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda for your time.",66,,
361,0.97,1889.687,1897.095,"Council, it is a pleasure to be here with all of you and an honor to be nominated to such a--an important group.",66,,
362,0.97,1897.095,1908.139,Many of you may know me from my day job as the President of restaurants and as the President of the Seattle restaurant alliance.,66,,
363,0.97,1908.139,1912.343,I also manage a busy home life.,66,,
364,0.97,1912.343,1915.38,My wife is a--intensive care doctor at Swedish hospital.,66,,
365,0.97,1915.38,1919.851,"So between the two of us, we have a fairly busy schedule.",66,,
366,0.97,1919.851,1927.959,We have three young children and a household that needs a lot of support over time.,66,,
367,0.97,1927.959,1941.139,So I began getting involved with chair Mosqueda's legislation pretty early on and supported throughout as someone who believes in taking care of those who take care of you and those who are most precious to you.,66,,
368,0.97,1941.139,1957.055,"I do realize that there are people throughout who don't always think the way I do and wanting to find ways defines to support--individuals and their families, especially domestic workers.",66,,
369,0.97,1957.055,1972.704,One of the things that became very apparent to me during the pandemic in particular was the degree to which domestic workers were sidelined much like many restaurant workers and others with not very many opportunities for employment.,66,,

551,0.97,2942.339,2953.984,We started this journey in December 2020 and over the past neighbor months we met for hours doing good for the community as our driving force.,99,,
552,0.97,2953.984,2955.986,The recommendation goes across four pillars.,99,,
553,0.97,2955.986,2965.062,"Business development, affordable housing and land acquisition, education Despairties and health Despairties to uplift these pillars.",99,,
554,0.97,2965.062,2968.799,There are nine recommendations with 18 strategies.,99,,
555,0.97,2968.799,2975.505,These recommendations are rooted in data and evidence on the current situation and the black and Brown communities.,99,,
556,0.97,2975.505,2986.75,They are not by themselves sufficient to transform the conditions for black and Brown communities and will require additional commitments to continue and sustain them.,99,,

563,0.97,3044.608,3045.008,Good morning.,100,,
564,0.97,3045.008,3048.779,Thank you for taking the time to listen to our presentation today.,100,,
565,0.97,3048.779,3054.317,I would first like to start by clarifying my introduction.,100,,
566,0.97,3054.317,3064.728,My name is Donna Moodie.,100,,
567,0.97,3064.728,3069.232,I found several small businesses own several small businesses.,100,,
568,0.97,3069.232,3075.539,Like many small business in our city I have struggled like in others.,100,,
569,0.97,3075.539,3082.579,I have Maxed out my credit cards.,100,,
570,0.97,3082.579,3087.918,I've taken out loans that were questionable.,100,,
571,0.97,3087.918,3090.921,I feel like my business is an Interictal part of our community.,100,,
572,0.97,3090.921,3093.623,It paints the picture of diversity in our city.,100,,
573,0.97,3093.623,3096.993,"It is a meeting place, a gathering place that is unique.",100,,
574,0.97,3096.993,3105.368,It is some place where people from all walks of life Garth and meet each other and talk about community.,100,,
575,0.97,3105.368,3112.175,I think this is representative of many small owned businesses in our city and I wonder why they struggle so much.,100,,
576,0.97,3112.175,3123.82,What we day Vised in the small group pillar is a way to give businesses the money they need to have dignity when applying and to also get support after they receive money.,100,,
577,0.97,3123.82,3135.699,"It was our plan to try to give members of a small business community funds that would support grants, also loans and also Forgivable loans.",100,,
578,0.97,3135.699,3151.681,"With the technical assistance that we want to take from the $7.5 million, $2.5 million to technical assistance, we wanted to not only reach out to people in our community to see if they could be someone who could fill out an application and get funding.",100,,
579,0.97,3151.681,3157.487,We also wanted to extend it to offer people support once they have the money in hand.,100,,
580,0.97,3157.487,3186.016,I think you will find that a lot of the perspective we looked at in gathering people that need money and try to get it to them will yield people feeling more stable and having stronger footing in the business industry will see business owners able to Restain staff and also see business owners able to increase their revenue creating generational wealth in their communities and having highly esteemed individuals.,100,,
581,0.97,3186.016,3195.425,I would like pass it on to our next presenter,100,,
582,0.97,3195.425,3195.825,Great.,101,,
583,0.97,3195.825,3196.86,"Thank you, Donna.",101,,
584,0.97,3196.86,3197.394,I'm Sheila Edwards-Lang.,101,,
585,0.97,3197.394,3201.598,I've been an educator in the Seattle community for over 30 years.,101,,
586,0.97,3201.598,3214.044,I was joined by a group of other folks on the education work group who are just as experienced and somewhere as committed to serving in our community.,101,,
587,0.97,3214.044,3227.591,So we know education is a path to equitable economic stability and civic engagement and our region.,101,,
588,0.97,3227.591,3229.793,They have historic experience in educational outcomes.,101,,
589,0.97,3229.793,3242.572,The three recommendations are designed to address those equities.,101,,
590,0.97,3242.572,3250.146,The funding has been really good and prosperous for our community.,101,,
591,0.97,3250.146,3263.326,Most of that funding goes to larger organizations that have the can Passty to rest the capacity to respond.,101,,
592,0.97,3263.326,3264.694,We are reimbursed for services.,101,,
593,0.97,3264.694,3270.467,You have to have the capital up front and many of the instances to move forward with Rfps.,101,,
594,0.97,3270.467,3285.415,We propose funding in the form of a new educational Fund.,101,,
595,0.97,3285.415,3288.818,With small amounts of funding.,101,,
596,0.97,3288.818,3292.455,We want to see more of that.,101,,
597,0.97,3292.455,3299.629,One example that has outstanding outcomes for youth is one world now.,101,,
598,0.97,3299.629,3302.565,It focuses on language and leadership skill development.,101,,
599,0.97,3302.565,3306.503,It seeks to increase the global experiences.,101,,
600,0.97,3306.503,3314.311,"It has an annual operating budget of $750,000.",101,,
601,0.97,3314.311,3316.713,98% of their students graduate on time and go to college.,101,,
602,0.97,3316.713,3321.551,If you think about that that is just outstanding.,101,,
603,0.97,3321.551,3328.525,It exceeds what we do in Seattle public schools and in our state.,101,,
604,0.97,3328.525,3339.035,"Despite these outstanding outcomes, the organization does not have the capacity to compete.",101,,
605,0.97,3339.035,3348.578,With investment and Cbos like one world now we expect to see an increase in high school completion and college readiness and more racial diversity in our teaching staff.,101,,
606,0.97,3348.578,3358.988,We also want to see more funding for cultural organizations that do the important work of sharing the contributions of communities.,101,,
607,0.97,3358.988,3370.1,It allows students to embrace their own identities and improve their self esteem.,101,,
608,0.97,3370.1,3378.842,Finally we want to see an investment in addressing the Disproportionality of folks in the criminal justice system.,101,,
609,0.97,3378.842,3385.515,Reentry programs with the focus on education and wrap around services can reduce.,101,,
610,0.97,3385.515,3399.963,This funding will ensure formerly incarcerated folks gain the skills and knowledge needed to obtain long term living wage employment and transition successfully out of the the correction system.,101,,
611,0.97,3399.963,3406.636,So we--hope you will support these investments.,101,,
612,0.97,3406.636,3406.903,Thank you.,101,,
613,0.97,3406.903,3407.203,Next slide.,101,,
614,0.97,3407.203,3411.374,.,101,,
615,0.97,3411.374,3412.075,Hi.,102,,
616,0.97,3412.075,3414.144,I'm the executive director.,102,,
617,0.97,3414.144,3422.485,It is a social service agency really focussing on health equity and we have been doing that work for 34 years.,102,,
618,0.97,3422.485,3434.798,I myself have worked in the medical field and around health equity for more than 30 years.,102,,
619,0.97,3434.798,3443.64,Healthy families is a critical and vital part.,102,,
620,0.97,3443.64,3464.327,"Equitable community task force we recommend a $6.2 million to improve healthy food access, environmental justice plus building a pipeline for culturally cultural appropriate health care and careers.",102,,
621,0.97,3464.327,3474.17,We thought about how could we really affect and have a positive effect on the health outcomes for communities.,102,,
622,0.97,3474.17,3481.544,We recognize first that starts with good and food access.,102,,
623,0.97,3481.544,3492.856,Often times communities of color have food deserts and other things that prohibit them from having healthy and nutritious food.,102,,
624,0.97,3492.856,3505.235,"We created the healthy food fund investing $750,000 to kind of help address the inequities.",102,,
625,0.97,3505.235,3513.91,"We also created a strategy that is formed to table allowing $200,000 to be invested in that area.",102,,
626,0.97,3513.91,3529.859,The goal is to increase the number of children that have access to healthy food increasing renew to black and Brown farmers and reducing food waste and increasing connection to farmers to land and to new food.,102,,
627,0.97,3529.859,3539.536,One of the things that the pandemic did is he lighted the deep inequities we have for food access.,102,,
628,0.97,3539.536,3557.72,"Our agency is one of the agencies that small agencies that try to respond to that need and we are able to pass out over 2,000 boxes of food to our families and to our youth programs.",102,,
629,0.97,3557.72,3560.757,What we saw is often times they did not have access to food.,102,,
630,0.97,3560.757,3571.801,"Even when they did, when schools offered and it they were able to go to the schools, there were other things that prohibited them from wanting to access that food.",102,,
631,0.97,3571.801,3585.782,We believe this strategy addressed this really immediate need and when we began to develop these strategies we thought about immediate need and long term need.,102,,
632,0.97,3585.782,3589.018,Some of the other things was the environmental justice.,102,,
633,0.97,3589.018,3606.369,"We created the fund that would invest $550,000 in the hopes of tackling some soft critical issues around capacity building, air quality, green jobs.",102,,
634,0.97,3606.369,3613.843,What we know often times communities suffer from environmental injustice.,102,,
635,0.97,3613.843,3617.547,This--these funds would be to address that issue.,102,,
636,0.97,3617.547,3629.058,"And so the last one is one that is really near and dear to my heart, the last strategy is really direct culture responsive, inclusive health care.",102,,
637,0.97,3629.058,3636.699,As a former health care worker it is critical.,102,,
638,0.97,3636.699,3653.282,"We know, the statistics show us Whn we can create a system where people can feel relevant, they can feel more than a number, they can relate to the individual they are coming in to serve them, that they get better health outcomes.",102,,
639,0.97,3653.282,3674.637,We created this investment really to address those issues and to build a team to really think about what is the best way to bring health equity to Seattle.,102,,
640,0.97,3674.637,3675.071,Thank you very much.,102,,
641,0.97,3675.071,3680.309,I'm back.,103,,
642,0.97,3680.309,3680.61,Housing.,103,,
643,0.97,3680.61,3681.511,We asked for $8.8 million.,103,,
644,0.97,3681.511,3696.759,"In being in Seattle for the last 21 years which is where I grew up basically as an adult, um--I didn't know what it meant to be on this task force for--I just knew I needed to be there.",103,,
645,0.97,3696.759,3702.965,As an artist we are often asked to be at these types of tables.,103,,
646,0.97,3702.965,3712.241,When discussing housing it made me think what was my expertise and being able to bring that to the table.,103,,
647,0.97,3712.241,3712.708,My expertise is this.,103,,
648,0.97,3712.708,3720.65,There was a time when I was a full-time artist.,103,,
649,0.97,3720.65,3722.318,I remember when I started this organization.,103,,
650,0.97,3722.318,3733.996,We were on stage and I was on the cover of a section of the Seattle times written by--I can't remember his name right now because I'm so emotional.,103,,
651,0.97,3733.996,3743.739,I remember going home that night after having a great production and knowing I was ton cover of the paper and my lights being off.,103,,
652,0.97,3743.739,3754.383,"Having to sleep that night in my house when it was cold in my clothes, I remember waking up the next day and having to go to my friend's house and eat.",103,,
653,0.97,3754.383,3758.654,"It wasn't I wasn't working, I was working a lot.",103,,
654,0.97,3758.654,3761.757,I had about five different contracts I was working on.,103,,
655,0.97,3761.757,3764.393,I just didn't have enough money coming in.,103,,
656,0.97,3764.393,3787.15,"So when I think of housing, and I think of the opportunities and what we can do--I think about why we as a--as a task force wanted to do lease to own because it is not--we understand that lease to own means that we put the power back into the hands of the community.",103,,
657,0.97,3787.15,3795.191,We remove the power from the developers who we love because you have to build the buildings.,103,,
658,0.97,3795.191,3799.662,We really want it to be about community ownership.,103,,
659,0.97,3799.662,3803.833,We know with ownership comes power.,103,,
660,0.97,3803.833,3812.842,We also talked about technical assistance and apprenticeship and are looking at those systems of education that make it more accessible.,103,,
661,0.97,3812.842,3827.89,So apprenticeship is not just for construction skills but also for contractors and then looking down road to apprenticeships for health and business and artistry and education.,103,,
662,0.97,3827.89,3832.962,Different ways of doing things means we uplift our community.,103,,
663,0.97,3832.962,3833.829,We also talked about retention.,103,,
664,0.97,3833.829,3835.264,Keeping people in their homes.,103,,
665,0.97,3835.264,3840.77,How do we keep them in their homes?,103,,
666,0.97,3840.77,3841.704,We have the housing Department.,103,,
667,0.97,3841.704,3842.905,We have the health Department.,103,,
668,0.97,3842.905,3844.473,We have the business Department.,103,,
669,0.97,3844.473,3853.149,What happens when we build a system with technology and those systems are connected?,103,,
670,0.97,3853.149,3860.89,That small business owner like Donna Moodie can be flagged for programs to let them have home ownership.,103,,
671,0.97,3860.89,3864.594,To let them have good health care.,103,,
672,0.97,3864.594,3869.265,To help them have educational programs and to bring it all together.,103,,
673,0.97,3869.265,3880.243,So in the housing section we talked about creating a pipeline that feeds an Ecosystem that speaks to one another.,103,,
674,0.97,3880.243,3883.512,So we also talked about generational wealth.,103,,
675,0.97,3883.512,3887.316,Because our communities and our families have changed.,103,,
676,0.97,3887.316,3887.75,Things have shifted.,103,,
677,0.97,3887.75,3899.862,Our great grandparents who tried to buy that land to pass down from one generation to the next generation have passed away or are unable to take care of their services.,103,,
678,0.97,3899.862,3928.357,How do we instill and work with the city as a whole in and the city help us in thinking about not just the now but to pass and get on from generation to generation and building a training program that speaks to all of our pillars and all of the things we need to make Seattle the place we know that it can be?,103,,
679,0.97,3928.357,3934.697,So I say forget about the silos.,103,,
680,0.97,3934.697,3940.569,Lets bring us together.,103,,
681,0.97,3940.569,3949.412,Next slide.,103,,
682,0.97,3949.545,3960.623,So Council members here you can see the full outline of all the recommendations with detailed dollar amounts which I know folks have been curious about.,104,,
683,0.97,3960.623,3968.164,Lots of the questions we have been getting are when this money be able to get into community?,104,,
684,0.97,3968.164,3990.252,"We know folks are really struggling just to survive, not just getting the chance to thrive and so one of the things that we are asking you all is to work with us as the task force is committed to working with you all to help get these dollars into community to start doing good work as soon as possible.",104,,
685,0.97,3990.252,3991.821,We can go on to the next steps.,104,,
686,0.97,3991.821,4000.663,I want to ask if any of the Council members have any questions for the task force.,104,,
687,0.97,4000.663,4006.135,Vice chair Herbold.,104,,
688,0.97,4006.135,4006.569,Thank BS.,105,,
689,0.97,4006.569,4009.038,S.,105,,
690,0.97,4009.038,4009.572,Two questions.,105,,
691,0.97,4009.572,4017.88,Maybe this is going to be covered by Chris in next steps.,105,,
692,0.97,4017.88,4030.826,Can you give us a sense of the allocation that is included in this recommendation?,105,,
693,0.97,4030.826,4061.023,"It looks like the funds that are recommended total nearly the full $30 million but just wondering #40U7 we will be covering the administrative cost to implement the proposed spending and then related to that, because as I understand it, expanding existing contracts will--is one thing that will reduce the administrative costs.",105,,
694,0.97,4061.023,4081.11,Do we have a sense of how many of these dollars can be allocated through existing contracts versus the development of new Rfps for new and innovative programs?,105,,
695,0.97,4081.11,4082.411,Yeah.,106,,
696,0.97,4082.411,4084.78,Thank you for that question.,106,,
697,0.97,4084.78,4089.218,So we are--blessed to be in Seattle.,106,,
698,0.97,4089.218,4118.481,A city that is on the footing towards justice and many of our city departments already have programs that are trying to do this great work and as the task force we have been working closely with city staff and the different departments to identify where there is already this work happening we can supplement and then identifying gaps where we might need to create something new out of it.,106,,
699,0.97,4118.481,4141.504,You can see in the different recommendations where there might be something like an Rfp process or the need to hire a consultant to create em something.,106,,
700,0.97,4141.504,4146.375,A thumbs up.,107,,
701,0.97,4146.375,4148.811,Thank you.,107,,
702,0.97,4148.811,4151.68,"Not seeing--Council member Morales, please go ahead.",107,,
703,0.97,4151.68,4157.286,I want to follow up on the question a little bit.,108,,
704,0.97,4157.286,4163.526,First I just want to act knowledge and say thank you for including issues about food insecurity in this work.,108,,
705,0.97,4163.526,4172.434,You may or may not know I worked as a food systems consultant for ten years.,108,,
706,0.97,4172.434,4178.407,This is an issue near and dear to my heart.,108,,
707,0.97,4178.407,4188.517,There is a lot of work that needs to be done to make sure we are connecting not just food access but culturally appropriate food.,108,,
708,0.97,4188.517,4203.265,One of the organization I worked with was doing--is doing a farm stand every summer and--when it started there was--a lot of barriers to getting people to come to the farm stand.,108,,
709,0.97,4203.265,4208.871,I think in part because there is this perception that farmer's markets are only for wealthy people.,108,,
710,0.97,4208.871,4223.519,"Even when we were able to attract lower income folks, folks from the neighborhood to come, if they--were from a different culture we weren't necessarily able to access Cull rally appropriate vegetables.",108,,
711,0.97,4223.519,4231.06,"If we were selling broccoli and they don't know what to do with it, that is not a Yufls access point for them.",108,,
712,0.97,4231.06,4242.404,"Then were other issues around whether we could take wick, whether we could--our Ebt card machine was working, if there was Internet connection so we could use the Ebt Swiper.",108,,
713,0.97,4242.404,4253.549,There is just a lot of infrastructure issues that come--challenges that come with trying to get people better access.,108,,
714,0.97,4253.549,4262.391,I am happy this to the see this is part of the focus and--eager to help all of you make sure you are getting that done.,108,,
715,0.97,4262.391,4294.056,"Um, my question as a follow up from Council member Herbold's questions is one of the things you said is there is a real emphasis on making sure we are providing this public resource to smaller organizations who may not have the capital or capacity to engage with all of these Rfp processes.",108,,
716,0.97,4294.056,4316.345,"If that is the goal and in terms of implementation you are thinking about starting with who you are already funding, I am just wondering if that is a mismatch or how--because I think we do currently fund a lot of large organizations.",108,,
717,0.97,4316.345,4327.456,I hear very often from small community organization they can't compete or these big organization get the money and may doll out little bits of it to the small organizations.,108,,
718,0.97,4327.456,4333.562,The folks on the ground really doing the work don't have access the way they need it.,108,,
719,0.97,4333.562,4341.47,I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about that for a lack of a better word that mismatch.,108,,
720,0.97,4341.47,4344.506,Thank you very much for that question.,109,,
721,0.97,4344.506,4377.74,"One of the things we recognize in our work is that because of the Disinvestment and being kept away for resources, many communities don't have the technical knowledge or just the staff to really keeping--or even go out and try to get into the different programs that the city has and so as we have been working with city staff, trying to start designing some of these Rfps we really made it a central point that we can't just do business as usual because it will get the same results.",109,,
722,0.97,4377.74,4395.124,We need be designing these Rfps and providing the if he can nickel E--technical assistance because we know we need as many hands on deck to reverse generations if not centuries of chronic Disinvestment and exploitation.,109,,
723,0.97,4395.124,4409.271,"If I could add one of the things we talked about with deal and Hsd and arts, they have ran pilots of alternative ways.",110,,
724,0.97,4409.271,4423.152,We asked them to identify the community based organizations who are already getting money from whether it was parks and from any Department and trying to put together a list of all of the community based organizations that we know about.,110,,
725,0.97,4423.152,4425.154,Some of which may already be getting funding from the city.,110,,
726,0.97,4425.154,4430.826,"If there is a possibility to add on to those, that is great.",110,,
727,0.97,4430.826,4441.27,Really designing just a different way of getting money into those organizations' hands.,110,,
728,0.97,4441.27,4456.718,And we recognize the initial funding may go to those organizations already doing business with the city but that the long term goal is in the next to design this process that would make it easier for more of those small community based organizations to be at the table.,110,,
729,0.97,4456.718,4487.115,I would also like to add one of the considerations we had with technical assistance in the business pillar was to use Paem part of that technical assistance to Saek out businesses that may be in need so the assistance wouldn't just begin once the application were in and people received money and we wouldn't just be guiding them on how to spend it but use some of the proceeds from technical assistance.,111,,
730,0.97,4487.416,4506.869,Some times questions are Dauchth.,111,,
731,0.97,4506.869,4510.706,S the--daunting.,111,,
732,0.97,4510.706,4520.148,We wanted to focus on outreach so not only what we get with actually spending a little time finding businesses in need.,111,,
733,0.97,4520.148,4526.455,Thank you very much for that question and the series of answers.,112,,
734,0.97,4526.455,4530.192,I think Donna you mentioned it well in your comments at the beginning.,112,,
735,0.97,4530.192,4545.707,How do we also make sure we are making these applications really simple and easy and not so time consuming and you just mentioned Dr. Edwards laying about how you have been Partnering with deal.,112,,
736,0.97,4545.707,4549.711,I found an E-mail he got a huge compliment they said.,112,,
737,0.97,4549.711,4556.118,It has never been so easy for me to fill out this application.,112,,
738,0.97,4556.118,4564.026,This I think is a continuation of that same mentality and how do we reduce the barriers and dollars directly into community.,112,,
739,0.97,4564.026,4566.361,Maybe with that we should go into the next steps here.,112,,
740,0.97,4566.361,4574.87,We will see if there is any additional questions.,112,,
741,0.97,4574.87,4579.107,A couple of us are using the raise the hand feature.,113,,
742,0.97,4579.107,4583.512,"If that is not your preference, happy to wave at the screen moving forward.",113,,
743,0.97,4583.512,4585.213,I see hands now.,114,,
744,0.97,4585.213,4585.514,"Okay, great.",114,,
745,0.97,4585.514,4589.918,We will do Council member Lewis and Council President Gonzalez.,114,,
746,0.97,4589.918,4592.688,I will keep the screen open here with the virtual hands.,114,,
747,0.97,4592.688,4601.396,Then we do want to make sure to hear the next as well to see if there is questions related to that.,114,,
748,0.97,4601.396,4602.264,This is very brief.,115,,
749,0.97,4602.264,4612.14,I would be Remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to congratulate Dr. Sheila Edwards Lang on her appointment as the next Chancellor.,115,,
750,0.97,4612.14,4618.38,I want to get that out there.,115,,
751,0.97,4618.38,4622.784,Having known Dr. Edwards Lang since my time and really morning her leadership.,115,,
752,0.97,4622.784,4627.489,This seems like an appropriate time given she is on our panel.,115,,
753,0.97,4627.489,4630.359,Thank you so much for that service.,115,,
754,0.97,4630.359,4632.461,Congratulations on that great appointment.,115,,
755,0.97,4632.461,4632.794,Thank you.,116,,
756,0.97,4632.794,4638.233,The only bittersweet part is I have to move to Tacoma.,116,,
757,0.97,4638.233,4648.143,"It is a great opportunity but I will be moving, relocating.",116,,
758,0.97,4648.143,4648.877,Congratulations.,117,,
759,0.97,4648.877,4650.012,Beautiful sister city.,117,,
760,0.97,4650.012,4650.445,Council President.,117,,
761,0.97,4650.445,4655.684,I just wanted to say thanks also to the work of the task force members.,118,,
762,0.97,4655.684,4672.667,"I know this was tough challenging work and it has been happening for many, many months amidst unique and historic challenges in terms of engaging in this--task force work which happens in person.",118,,
763,0.97,4672.667,4705.0,"I wanted to--I don't have a question, I wanted to sort of--especially acknowledge a lot of the acknowledgment in these recommendations about the need to build capacity amongst communities to sort of build that infrastructure over resilience into communities so they are able to be in a position to even apply for grants or ask for technical assistance.",118,,
764,0.97,4705.0,4724.853,I think building that is critically important to what I think is our collective long term vision around producing better community alternatives that are going to be better situated to produce equitable community safety within our board community.,118,,
765,0.97,4724.853,4767.162,Really appreciate the--capacity building opportunities that are represented through many if not all of the recommendations that we are seeing here and really excited about being able to learn more about the housing proposals as well including the lease to own program and interested in making sure we have an opportunity to hear more details about some of those specific recommendations as we don't learn more about how to implement these recommendations as quickly and as equitably as possible.,118,,
766,0.97,4767.162,4768.13,"Thank you, chair.",118,,
767,0.97,4768.13,4768.63,Well said.,119,,
768,0.97,4768.63,4769.831,Okay.,119,,
769,0.97,4769.831,4771.399,"Please for ahead, Chris",119,,
770,0.97,4771.399,4772.801,Thank you very much.,120,,
771,0.97,4772.801,4785.514,Being there aren't any questions I know we have discussed coming back next week additional questions if city staff needs more time to go through our proposal.,120,,
772,0.97,4785.514,4803.632,I would be inclined as a labor Organizer to ask for the urgency of the moment community is in dire need and really looking forward to getting the chance for our city partners to be able to get these Rfps designed and in the street so to speak.,120,,
773,0.97,4803.632,4828.39,So it would be my preference to ask of you all as a committee to vote to lift the--lift--[Indiscernible] as soon as possible and knowing that the task force members are committed to staying involved in this process and being a resource for the city to help implement these recommendations not just for up this coming current budget year but going forward.,120,,
774,0.97,4828.39,4840.602,We know the work of undoing a legacy of oppression is not short but it will be sweet.,120,,
775,0.97,4840.602,4844.206,Thank you so much.,121,,
776,0.97,4844.206,4845.774,Any additional questions or comments?,121,,
777,0.97,4845.774,4846.041,Okay.,122,,
778,0.97,4846.041,4847.175,"Thank you for the presentation, too.",122,,
779,0.97,4847.175,4851.813,Also the work you did to walk us through the initial set of recommendations.,122,,
780,0.97,4851.813,4870.865,"I know we are able to pair that information with the dollar amounts and to build that capacity as was talked about here in addition to also making sure that we are not being unwise with people's time, respecting their time.",122,,
781,0.97,4870.865,4875.303,Really like the aspect of streamlining this.,122,,
782,0.97,4875.303,4880.542,I don't anticipate there will be questions that would require the task force members to have to come back.,122,,
783,0.97,4880.542,4891.119,I think that will be as simple as having it on our agenda for the next meeting.,122,,
784,0.97,4891.119,4892.42,You are all very accessible.,122,,
785,0.97,4892.42,4896.224,Thank you for picking up the phone when we all called.,122,,
786,0.97,4896.224,4908.27,I will see if there is any last questions from our colleagues.,122,,
787,0.97,4908.27,4910.005,Any additional comments from you?,122,,
788,0.97,4910.005,4910.205,Okay.,122,,
789,0.97,4910.205,4910.772,Well congratulations again.,122,,
790,0.97,4910.772,4912.44,This is a tremendous body of work.,122,,
791,0.97,4912.44,4940.235,"I think that there has already been some comments as well from all of you about the importance of continuing some of the initial investments we have made in the wake of Covid, the way in which we have gotten dollars out the door directly into communities whether it is small business owners or community effected Dispro Pors Nately by Covid, child care providers and members of our arts and culture committee.",122,,
792,0.97,4940.235,4948.877,It feels like many of these building blocks are coming together very nicely.,122,,
793,0.97,4948.877,4958.386,I really appreciate your work you have done.,122,,
794,0.97,4958.386,4961.79,Anything else?,122,,

806,0.97,5010.905,5038.299,We included the Council respond to the recommendations so it wasn't a report that just sat on a shelf somewhere.,124,,
807,0.97,5038.299,5042.27,Members of the domestic workers board came to us with recommendations on May 18th.,124,,
808,0.97,5042.27,5066.394,Thanks again to the board for presenting and for the work that the office of labor standard systems for their work in service to make sure that we were hearing directly from workers and the hiring entities.,124,,
809,0.97,5066.394,5075.003,Under the procedure outlined we have a requirement to respond to those recommendation within 120 days of receiving them.,124,,
810,0.97,5075.003,5082.644,My we desire is we try to do that earlier.,124,,
811,0.97,5082.644,5098.393,Be that with that I will turn it over the Karina to give us quick update.,124,,
812,0.97,5098.393,5105.834,My hope is we can sort of outline some of the response that we will be interested in sharing.,124,,
813,0.97,5105.834,5114.375,This is no vote for this today.,124,,
814,0.97,5114.375,5114.876,This is a discussion.,124,,
815,0.97,5114.876,5125.386,I will turn it over to Karina.,124,,
816,0.97,5127.622,5129.691,Good morning Council members.,125,,
817,0.97,5129.691,5131.092,I am from central staff.,125,,
818,0.97,5131.092,5146.708,I will present to you this morning a presentation that provides a high level over view.,125,,
819,0.97,5146.708,5166.294,And again as Council member Mosqueda Referenced the board presented the recommendations to Committee on May 18th and we are working towards at the very latest a September response.,125,,
820,0.97,5166.294,5166.961,Hope Foerlgy August.,125,,
821,0.97,5166.961,5171.366,The board had four main areas for their recommendations.,125,,
822,0.97,5171.366,5178.339,Then there were a total of 11 recommendations with some Subset.,125,,
823,0.97,5178.339,5198.626,"The topic areas were investing this community expertise and building trust, providing more materials and resources to workers and hiring entities, implementing policy changes to improve the ordinance and also mandating portable benefits for domestic workers.",125,,
824,0.97,5198.626,5215.276,"In consideration of these recommendations and under the governing procedure, this draft draft--response provides a written response with the following guidance.",125,,
825,0.97,5215.276,5220.648,I think there is only three that have been selected for this draft response.,125,,
826,0.97,5220.648,5225.887,A is that the committee would support this submission of a proposal to put before the Council for approval.,125,,
827,0.97,5225.887,5232.427,B is that the committee would request more information from the board.,125,,
828,0.97,5232.427,5246.674,C the committee would request the board to develop alternatives and D the committee would reject the proposal with reasons for a rejection and then last the committee would consider the proposal on a longer Timeline.,125,,
829,0.97,5246.674,5254.782,So as a preview there is no recommendation.,125,,
830,0.97,5254.782,5258.086,There are requests for the over items.,125,,
831,0.97,5258.086,5266.294,Sometimes a mingling of both requested proposal along perhaps longer Timeline.,125,,
832,0.97,5266.294,5270.398,So to begin these draft responses are quite broad.,125,,
833,0.97,5270.398,5280.808,They indicate broad support for the board's recommendation.,125,,
834,0.97,5280.808,5306.768,"There is no--[Indiscernible] and to empower the board to make their own decision making and to Prioritize their own areas of focus that then the committee can then receive, evaluate and with an understanding the committee is eager to support improving the working conditions and lives of domestic workers.",125,,
835,0.97,5306.768,5322.45,So the first recommendation under the category in investing in community expertise and building trust is expanding fund for community organizations.,125,,
836,0.97,5322.45,5334.429,As a bit of background office of lay Bhor standards already has a--significant amount of funding for community organizations.,125,,
837,0.97,5334.429,5342.37,It is about $2.1 million total.,125,,
838,0.97,5342.37,5348.71,"Then $600,000 is for businesses and hiring entities.",125,,
839,0.97,5348.71,5359.387,This reasonable care men addition would propose expanding that money to make sure it has specific funds for domestic worker outreach and on going funds for domestic worker outreach.,125,,
840,0.97,5359.387,5389.65,Right now my understanding of the way that the funding is organized for community and business organizations is that it is a broad funding that the organizations decide how to divide as far as focus for each labor Standard and it is requesting specific funding for domestic workers with recognition there could need to be different ways of reaching those workers and hiring separate from workers who are functioning as employees.,125,,
841,0.97,5389.65,5405.8,So the draft response would be to broadly support this goal and to support submission of a budget--of a request for a specific Autohaunt of money and that proposal could come from the board and or office of labor standards.,125,,
842,0.97,5405.8,5412.874,So there are a number of recommendations that have this kind of response where it is the committee WELCOMES a proposal.,125,,
843,0.97,5412.874,5414.609,It could come from the board.,125,,
844,0.97,5414.609,5426.654,Could come from office of labor standards or a combination of both.,125,,
845,0.97,5426.788,5456.284,[Indiscernible] yet their input is so critical in making those decisions.,125,,
846,0.97,5456.284,5464.792,So the committee would be in alignment but also want to have some more information from the board on this recommendation.,125,,
847,0.97,5464.792,5468.663,Perhaps some short and long term ideas for compensation.,125,,
848,0.97,5468.663,5475.636,Something that could happen now but maybe not sure about what would happen in the future.,125,,
849,0.97,5475.636,5488.516,The committee also would be interested in edge Mroerg separate from the board how compensating board members would impact other boards across the city.,125,,
850,0.97,5488.516,5503.998,So recognizing that compensating domestic workers wouldn't be an on Island on its own but it is all part of larger picture.,125,,
851,0.97,5504.298,5534.662,I believe the booklet has been printed and translated.,125,,
852,0.97,5534.662,5553.214,Then board recognizes an expansion of language access could benefit more workers and so there is interest in that and also updating materials creating new materials as informed by community organizations to know what is going to work best to reach workers and hiring Eptties.,125,,
853,0.97,5553.214,5560.855,So the committee would support submission of a request for that proposal.,125,,
854,0.97,5560.855,5576.103,Also in the category of providing more materials is the board's recommendation to fund a mailing to all households in Seattle.,125,,
855,0.97,5576.103,5587.281,"There are about 350,000 households in Seattle and they provided some feedback on the board's recommendations.",125,,
856,0.97,5587.281,5592.62,"There is a sense the cost could cost up to $175,000.",125,,
857,0.97,5592.62,5598.893,"It could be perhaps as low as $100,000 if there is some sort of targeting.",125,,
858,0.97,5598.893,5604.031,That provides a general frame work of the cost.,125,,
859,0.97,5604.031,5615.476,So the response would be the committee request more development of alternatives to this recommendation.,125,,
860,0.97,5615.476,5625.086,Perhaps an exploration of other partnerships with city departments and other means that could be more cost effective.,125,,
861,0.97,5625.086,5632.36,So support for this but wanting some alternatives to reach a similar goal.,125,,
862,0.97,5632.36,5641.736,Also in the same category would be a proposal to fund improvement of the domestic worker section of the office of labor standards Website.,125,,
863,0.97,5641.736,5653.614,The border communicated their belief that the Website could be more user friendly and have easier access to Spanish trance--translation.,125,,
864,0.97,5653.614,5676.203,They have a help Bot that could help guide users through the Website so the--drop response for this recommendation would be again for the board and for office of labor standards to submit a budget request.,125,,
865,0.97,5676.203,5685.813,And then last in this category are ways to ensure a third party platform compliance with domestic worker ordinance.,125,,
866,0.97,5685.813,5703.164,"So the background--the third party Apps, the Online enabled platforms that facilitate and can facilitate domestic worker provision of services to varying levels.",125,,
867,0.97,5703.164,5722.65,So there is an interest on the board to find out ways to reach those third party platforms to make sure they are aware of their obligations and also to help the consumers of those platforms be aware of the obligations as well.,125,,
868,0.97,5722.65,5727.054,That could take--that could be implemented in a variety of ways.,125,,
869,0.97,5727.054,5736.363,There could be letters to the platforms that the Council signs on and sends under their name or joins office of labor standards or joins other organizations.,125,,
870,0.97,5736.363,5747.274,"If there is a mandated notice of rights required to be given to workers, that something these third party platforms would need to do as well.",125,,
871,0.97,5747.274,5766.393,So the response would be the submission of a proposal from the board or the office of labor standards and how much this would cost to fund to meet their goals and also out front statement that the committee would be interested in signing a compliance letter to these third party platforms.,125,,
872,0.97,5766.393,5795.422,There is one more in this category of providing more materials and resources and that is a recommendation to address the impact of lack of health care for domestic workers and this could take the form of providing resources to hiring Eptties and for the committee and Council to advocate to the state legislator ways to adopt the statewide affordable health care insurance program.,125,,
873,0.97,5795.422,5829.823,The city departments could be a convening of office standards and office of immigrant and refugee affairs for--team and a draft response to this recommendation could be a submission of a board or office of labor standards proposal on how on the funding needed or the resources needed to make this recommendation move forward and the committee could take part in advocating for statewide affordable health care.,125,,
874,0.97,5829.823,5840.935,The next category regards policy changes to the ordinance.,125,,
875,0.97,5840.935,5851.512,I believe that all of the labor standards that are currently on the books have a mandated notice of rights that em employers are hiring entities need to provide.,125,,
876,0.97,5851.512,5860.654,When the ordinance was passed was there language in the ordinance required office of labor standards to create a document with a notice of rights.,125,,
877,0.97,5860.654,5866.393,It is not required to be provided to domestic workers.,125,,
878,0.97,5866.393,5880.941,So the board is engaging in some stake holder work to find out if the ordinance were amended to make it required legally for employers to give that information to workers.,125,,
879,0.97,5880.941,5882.376,What would be impact of that?,125,,
880,0.97,5882.376,5898.759,So the board is doing that work Chlt.,125,,
881,0.97,5898.893,5943.003,[Indiscernible] the next policy change would be to eliminate the exclusion of public funded home care workers from the ordinance in recognition there have been some--there has been a state law that has changed the landscape of publicly funded work so in the same vein as the previous proposal the committee would support submission of a proposal for this change and again with more information about the benefits and risks and the stake holder engagement and the committee encouraging working with Sciu on outreach and engagement.,125,,
882,0.97,5943.003,5948.976,The other policy change would be to eliminate the interference standard for joint hiring liability.,125,,
883,0.97,5948.976,5968.295,When there is a situation of a third party platform the way the accountability works with the ordinance is that the end user is not responsible for complying with the ordinance unless they directly interfere with--with the domestic worker rights.,125,,
884,0.97,5968.295,5970.064,This is more Sdwlap third party platforms.,125,,
885,0.97,5970.064,5971.999,It is any sort of separate hiring entity.,125,,
886,0.97,5972.299,5980.874,Than just third party platforms.,125,,
887,0.97,5980.874,5981.675,It is any sort of separate hiring entity.,125,,
888,0.97,5981.975,6009.436,So the board is interested in removing that shield from liability.,125,,
889,0.97,6009.436,6020.848,"The committee response would request more information from the board on that proposal, more information about the benefits and risks and stake holder engagement.",125,,
890,0.97,6020.848,6039.366,"And then the last recommendation which is perhaps the biggest and most complex would be to mandate a portable benefits program for domestic workers with a specific focus on access to paid leave, for sick days, rest days and other uses.",125,,
891,0.97,6039.366,6069.963,And in recognition that this proposal is quite vast and quite complex of the board would recommend that--I'm sorry the committee would recommend the board develop this proposal with office of labor standards and then submit it to the committee for their evaluation with the understanding there is very sincere support for developing the program but just recognition of its complexity.,125,,
892,0.97,6069.963,6079.74,Already central staff and Council member Mosqueda's office has sent four pages of questions to the coalition of the board that is would Recollecting on this proposal.,125,,
893,0.97,6079.74,6095.756,"There are many things to consider and so an interest of efficiency the committee would want to receive a more developed proposal, fully developed proposal from the board and office of labor standards.",125,,
894,0.97,6095.756,6107.468,So in Summery of the four categories of responses there would be five where the committee would support the submission of a proposal and in this particular instance it would be a budget proposal.,125,,
895,0.97,6107.468,6117.044,Next there would be three where the committee would support the submission of a legislative proposal.,125,,
896,0.97,6117.044,6131.158,Then in requesting more information there would be two funding resources to compensate workers for their expertise and that eliminating the standard for joint hiring liability and then last requesting the board to develop alternatives.,125,,
897,0.97,6131.158,6139.766,There would be one recommendation in this category which would be funding and mailing to all households in Seattle.,125,,
898,0.97,6139.766,6143.77,And that is the end of my presentation.,125,,
899,0.97,6143.77,6148.942,Are there any questions?,125,,
900,0.97,6148.942,6151.178,I'm happy to provide more information.,125,,
901,0.97,6151.178,6151.378,.,125,,
902,0.97,6151.378,6164.324,Thank you as always for walking us through a pretty dense recommendation and helping to distill the policy recommendations and the funding recommendations and the way you have I think has been very helpful.,126,,
903,0.97,6164.324,6178.405,"Again I want to thank members of the domestic workers standards board who also provided a very comprehensive power point presentation that had a similar outline in terms of funding recommendation, advocacy recommendations and policy exchanges.",126,,
904,0.97,6178.405,6183.844,There is a few things I would like to note.,126,,
905,0.97,6183.844,6200.427,"As she mentioned at the beginning, this is a unique board make up in that we have asked them to come back to us and give us Reck men additions so that this is not just a policy that is stagnant and recommendations don't sit on the shelf.",126,,
906,0.97,6200.427,6218.011,We also want to recognize that the board themselves as individuals who make up hiring entities and workers themselves absolutely have advocacy capacity to come and lobby the Council or work with the office of labor standards in anyway they would like to.,126,,
907,0.97,6218.011,6230.123,One of the things we are trying to offer here is initial indication of things we would love to see more of or help us understand more.,126,,
908,0.97,6230.123,6243.637,We want to indicate support for areas where we think there might be common ground and for them to help have a sense of areas we would like to see further explored as part of what she has outlined here.,126,,
909,0.97,6243.637,6263.924,This should not be an indication we are Priortizing one item over another or fully fund one item versus an another or an indication we are hoping they can work within the board to Prioritize.,126,,
910,0.97,6263.924,6275.902,And on the health care one they had suggested home care providers covered under Medicare contracts at the Federal level should not necessarily be covered in this domestic workers ordinance we passed two years ago.,126,,
911,0.97,6275.902,6280.807,We didn't include those because they had different protections.,126,,
912,0.97,6280.807,6296.757,There was state change that has made it more possible for us to cover those domestic workers and so we are interest Ed in following their lead and working with them.,126,,
913,0.97,6296.757,6300.527,I think that is a good follow up.,126,,
914,0.97,6300.527,6303.664,Then in terms of the--one more thing.,126,,
915,0.97,6303.664,6304.097,Sorry.,126,,
916,0.97,6304.097,6310.437,One more thing in terms of the portable benefits policy which is a large body of work.,126,,
917,0.97,6310.437,6345.906,From the research we have done and understanding where other cities are at thanks to the workers board we have another sense of what other cities are looking at including Pittsburgh and San Francisco and wanting to have our expert team at the office of labor standards really in sort of the evaluation and policy development chair for us to be able to have the expertise of both the board and Ols at the table has been something I think is extremely important.,126,,
918,0.97,6345.906,6352.079,It took Pittsburgh a few--I think they are working on the second round t second year of pulling together the policy recommendations.,126,,
919,0.97,6352.079,6365.892,As you all know from our conversation on domestic workers possible portable benefits a few years ago we sort of grappled with how to create our own individual city focus insurance system.,126,,
920,0.97,6365.892,6374.968,"Having that within the city of Seattle versus originally at the state level, how do we make that distinction was challenging policy conversation two years ago.",126,,
921,0.97,6374.968,6389.416,Really wanting to partner closely with office of labor standards as Pittsburgh has done in developing their legislation is something I think we could look at versus having the city council or one individual office come up with the policy in and of itself.,126,,
922,0.97,6389.416,6398.592,It feels like a much bigger conversation with a lot of research capacity needed than for example our office has within one office at the Council level.,126,,
923,0.97,6398.592,6422.682,I wanted to provide that additional context to the trust and support and honor the expertise within the domestic workers standards board and also note the incredible amount of work that is to come for a handful of these recommendation.,126,,
924,0.97,6422.682,6430.757,Vice chair Herbold and if there is other questions I will keep my hand on the eye features as well.,126,,
925,0.97,6430.757,6432.092,Thank you.,127,,
926,0.97,6432.092,6440.934,Can you remind me are these recommendations jointly to the Council and executive?,127,,
927,0.97,6440.934,6442.669,Are they recommendations to the executive?,127,,
928,0.97,6442.669,6490.584,"And the reason I ask and I appreciate that the--the slides include in their options for Council response an invitation to Ols to give us funding recommendations but it seems very important to me that these recommendation be directed to Ols and the Mayor's office because unlike many, many departments we have created the authority within Ols to independently of the Mayor give the Council funding recommendations as a way of creating independence for that Department.",127,,
929,0.97,6490.584,6510.437,So I would hope that--the office of labor standards is using that authority hearing the recommendations from the board and acting on those recommendations by making funding requests of directly of the Council.,127,,
930,0.97,6510.437,6523.216,So just--really would like to understand a little bit about who those--who those--recommendations are directed to.,127,,
931,0.97,6523.216,6523.483,Thanks.,127,,
932,0.97,6523.483,6528.521,"Council member Herbold I am--Oh, go ahead Council member Mosqueda.",128,,
933,0.97,6528.521,6528.788,I'm sorry.,128,,
934,0.97,6528.788,6535.762,Oh you didn't have anything to say.,128,,
935,0.97,6535.762,6536.062,All right.,128,,
936,0.97,6536.062,6538.064,I'm looking directly at the ordinance.,128,,
937,0.97,6538.064,6554.214,The part that addresses these Reck men additions and it--the ordinance States that the board will submit recommendations to the Mayor in and this committee by a certain time period which they have done.,128,,
938,0.97,6554.214,6562.689,The committee will consider the board's recommendations.,128,,
939,0.97,6562.689,6568.995,The committee will respond Www.Committee'Srestpond to the commit's response.,128,,
940,0.97,6568.995,6575.001,-- respond to the committee's response.,128,,
941,0.97,6575.001,6586.212,"Thinking what about you are talking about the budget, one way for the executive to respond is within Ols's budget to a degree.",128,,
942,0.97,6586.212,6594.12,There is no forthright requirement in the ordinance for the executive to respond.,128,,
943,0.97,6594.12,6594.487,Thank you.,129,,
944,0.97,6594.487,6594.721,Yeah.,130,,
945,0.97,6594.721,6596.69,I appreciate you asking that question.,130,,
946,0.97,6596.69,6606.366,I think that gets to the crux of the issue here.,130,,
947,0.97,6606.366,6607.267,There are so many great recommendation.,130,,
948,0.97,6607.267,6622.482,I can see how those recommendations being shared now hopefully will get Absolved into the recommendations to the executive and then ultimately to the Council and then we have the ability to add to it as well.,130,,
949,0.97,6622.482,6636.396,"In terms of policy development, we have really asked our office of labor standards to help be there as thought partners as we create policies that follow up on these recommendations.",130,,
950,0.97,6636.396,6652.812,It has to be more than just--the Council driving policy recommendation given the limited capacity both at the city council within our own offices and obviously you are incredible as one person who takes on all labor standards.,130,,
951,0.97,6652.812,6655.982,Some of these policy recommendations are so incredibly big.,130,,
952,0.97,6655.982,6671.831,That is why I believe that the cities like Pittsburgh have looked to their similar offices to develop robust legislation and do deep stake holder engagement.,130,,
953,0.97,6671.831,6675.535,I think it will be a joint effort.,130,,
954,0.97,6675.535,6677.604,It is what I am interested in.,130,,
955,0.97,6677.604,6684.644,I believe Steve from the office of labor standards has been a great partner as well as Jasmine here on the line with us.,130,,
956,0.97,6684.644,6686.413,I'm looking for the tile here.,130,,
957,0.97,6686.413,6708.368,I believe Jasmine is still with us wanting to better understand some of the recommendation and really have a chance to make sure we are continuing to advance our thoughts around what is possible policy wise but capacity is really more in the executive and Ols branch at this moment.,130,,
958,0.97,6708.368,6713.573,"Council President Gonzalez, anything from you?",131,,
959,0.97,6713.573,6713.773,Okay.,131,,
960,0.97,6713.773,6721.848,"Okay, I will do my best to summarize what I think our next steps and you can Chime in and let me know if I'm getting this right.",131,,
961,0.97,6721.848,6739.499,What I would like to do is if there is not a red flag or something not sitting with you well right now what I would like to do is talk to the board today and later this week as well about our initial recommendations.,131,,
962,0.97,6739.499,6746.639,I think having a recommendation letter that as vice chair Herbold has noted reflects the city family's response to the recommendations as my hope.,131,,
963,0.97,6746.639,6751.744,We would love to work closely with Ols and drafting the final letter.,131,,
964,0.97,6751.744,6763.656,We will put some more meat on the bone to fill out some of these details.,131,,
965,0.97,6763.656,6766.392,The verbal presentation we really comprehensive.,131,,
966,0.97,6766.392,6780.206,Coming up with the bill of rights took a better part of a year.,131,,
967,0.97,6780.206,6789.215,I know there is a tremendous amount of can Passty and interest in the community to advance these recommendations.,131,,
968,0.97,6789.215,6795.188,We will have conversations over the next two to three weeks.,131,,
969,0.97,6795.188,6800.193,We will work on finalizing a letter for you to take a look at the August 3RD meeting.,131,,
970,0.97,6800.193,6807.934,We are trying to hold these meetings in a public forum so members of the public and the board and others know how our deliberations are going.,131,,
971,0.97,6807.934,6816.676,After that August 3RD meet we will be plan to send a letter so we can get it out for the August Recess.,131,,
972,0.97,6816.676,6816.876,Okay.,131,,
973,0.97,6816.876,6817.777,Not hearing any concerns.,131,,
974,0.97,6817.777,6823.817,I think that the question asked by vice chair is in alignment with some of the questions I've asked as well.,131,,
975,0.97,6823.817,6834.594,Think we are all moving in the same direction.,131,,
976,0.97,6834.594,6841.568,I want to thank them.,131,,
977,0.97,6841.568,6844.47,Thank you very much.,131,,
978,0.97,6844.47,6849.175,Jasmine and director Steve for their collaboration.,131,,
979,0.97,6849.175,6849.442,All right.,131,,
980,0.97,6849.442,6849.809,Thanks so much.,131,,
981,0.97,6849.809,6858.384,"Lets move on to the next item of business, Madam clerk.",131,,

1006,0.97,7014.34,7014.707,Thank you.,137,,
1007,0.97,7014.707,7028.054,I wanted to note before I turn it over to my colleague Tom who will walk through the--staff memo before turning it back to me to describe potential amendments that there was an updated memo distributed this morning and posted to the agenda.,137,,
1008,0.97,7028.054,7035.361,I wanted to act knowledge there was a staff error.,137,,
1009,0.97,7035.361,7040.199,I wanted to confirm for the record that that has been updated.,137,,
1010,0.97,7040.199,7047.907,"This is reflects the sponsors of original intent that was Mischaracterized by staff, by me, in the memo.",137,,
1011,0.97,7047.907,7053.379,Version 2 is posted on the agenda.,137,,
1012,0.97,7053.379,7053.813,Updates are shown.,137,,
1013,0.97,7053.813,7058.184,For presentation today I'm showing a clean version of that memo so it is easier to read ton screen.,137,,
1014,0.97,7058.184,7073.599,With that I will turn it over to Tom to walk through the background Dpoin information and description of the legislation.,137,,
1015,0.97,7073.599,7075.001,"Thank you, Aly.",138,,
1016,0.97,7075.001,7075.334,Good morning.,138,,
1017,0.97,7075.334,7085.011,"Um, as Aly mentioned my presentation I have prepared will follow federally the memo that was produced up and loaded for the agenda this morning.",138,,
1018,0.97,7085.011,7103.596,It is going to cover a number of different concepts by way of a comprehensive where we have been and where we are now discussion about budget adjustments.,138,,
1019,0.97,7103.596,7110.436,I will cover the--Summery of the adjustments that have occurred so far.,138,,
1020,0.97,7110.436,7112.672,Both Automat and I can Council approved.,138,,
1021,0.97,7112.672,7119.579,Then turn to the bills that are on this morning's agenda.,138,,
1022,0.97,7119.579,7130.456,Then turn over the Aly who will review the amendments that we received from Council members and we will go into the next steps.,138,,
1023,0.97,7130.456,7136.262,So first just a quick touch on the background on adjustments that have been approved so far.,138,,
1024,0.97,7136.262,7158.384,As you see this is table one of the number one page one that shows through July 16th this year there have been a total of $2 billion of budget adjustments both automatic and Council approved which is a 31% increase to the budget that Council approved last fall.,138,,
1025,0.97,7158.384,7174.5,$1.9 billion of the increase was described and covered in the--staff memo that accompanied the 2021 carry forward bill that Council passed in May.,138,,
1026,0.97,7174.5,7175.034,That was ordinance 126326.,138,,
1027,0.97,7175.034,7189.382,The remainder is a set of one off stand alone ordinances that Council has passed since that may discussion.,138,,
1028,0.97,7189.382,7195.555,On the screen are the list of the various changes that Council has approved for the budget.,138,,
1029,0.97,7195.555,7222.381,I will highlight at this time just the most significant of this set of adjustments which is ordinance 1261371 which is in the middle of the screen which is the authorization of a Coronavirus local fiscal recovery funds that were received as part of the first--of the Federal American rescue plan act moneys.,138,,
1030,0.97,7222.381,7233.159,So that appropriates significant amounts for a variety of relief programs.,138,,
1031,0.97,7233.159,7245.705,So with those adjustments and those adjustments approved through may it brings the budget to $8.67 billion for this year.,138,,
1032,0.97,7245.705,7249.108,So that was a very quick treatment.,138,,
1033,0.97,7249.108,7257.883,I will pause to see if there are any questions from the committee about the background.,138,,
1034,0.97,7257.883,7258.117,Okay.,138,,
1035,0.97,7258.117,7262.388,"Thank you, Aly and Tom.",139,,
1036,0.97,7262.388,7264.49,I'm not seeing any hands.,139,,
1037,0.97,7264.49,7265.491,Great.,140,,
1038,0.97,7265.491,7277.803,Okay next I will take these bills and out of sequence so the first only talk about is Council bill 120112 which is the midyear supplemental appropriation bill.,140,,
1039,0.97,7277.803,7282.675,For the record the item number 8.,141,,
1040,0.97,7282.675,7284.81,"Thank you, Madam chair.",142,,
1041,0.97,7284.81,7288.047,So the first comprehensive supplemental was the carry forward.,142,,
1042,0.97,7288.047,7293.719,"When I say comprehensive, refreshing back to the May discussion.",142,,
1043,0.97,7293.719,7313.673,These are the--the significant proposals that come from the executive that come by way of a--city wide ask of all departments for adjustments that they may require to their budget during the year to address events were Unforeseeable at the time when the original budget was adopted.,142,,
1044,0.97,7313.673,7319.845,So could be sill bill 120112 so I will call it the midyear supplemental from here on out.,142,,
1045,0.97,7319.845,7322.682,It would increase the revised budget by $15 million total.,142,,
1046,0.97,7322.982,7327.753,Call it the midyear supplemental from here on out.,142,,
1047,0.97,7327.753,7328.854,It would increase the revised budget by $15 million total.,142,,
1048,0.97,7329.155,7337.897,It would add many positions.,142,,
1049,0.97,7337.897,7352.745,There are a few changes that were received or after the bill was transmitted that our--were corrected from the transmitted version and built into the received bill.,142,,
1050,0.97,7352.745,7365.257,One is an update to an item which I will cover later which involves the Seattle fire Department's use of fever requested moneys for vaccine and testing.,142,,
1051,0.97,7365.257,7374.867,There was a change that--to the community safety center position.,142,,
1052,0.97,7374.867,7388.981,There were positions that were housed in a budget line that no longer exists.,142,,
1053,0.97,7388.981,7396.455,So those were mostly technical in nature.,142,,
1054,0.97,7396.455,7398.958,I just wanted to highlight those.,142,,
1055,0.97,7398.958,7406.332,So now I will kind of begin by saying the end of the memo there is an attachment.,142,,
1056,0.97,7406.332,7426.652,"It is page 10 of the memo that shows a lot of detail describing the revised budget wide Department t approved changes so far and then just this particular bill, the midyear appropriation request.",142,,
1057,0.97,7426.652,7433.759,It is a bill with a lot of items.,142,,
1058,0.97,7433.759,7445.171,Just the strategy that I'm employing is to highlight those significant changes to a department budget or otherwise large dollar Sluls.,142,,
1059,0.97,7445.171,7450.176,Though happy to answer any questions on any detail.,142,,
1060,0.97,7450.176,7460.453,Perhaps we can--if you could Scroll to the last page of the memo just to give committee members a sense of--how that looks.,142,,
1061,0.97,7460.453,7473.065,"So this is the kind of the sweet of all the changes and you can see the larger values, the final column on the right t percentage changes that are large.",142,,
1062,0.97,7473.065,7478.37,"For example in the middle of lots of labor standards, 23% change.",142,,
1063,0.97,7478.37,7486.579,So I try to hit the highlights by virtue of size.,142,,
1064,0.97,7486.579,7503.829,Strike that--Strategizing for time.,142,,
1065,0.97,7503.829,7509.935,"If we could go back to page two, thank you.",142,,
1066,0.97,7509.935,7510.236,Maybe three.,142,,
1067,0.97,7510.236,7510.536,"Okay, great.",142,,
1068,0.97,7510.536,7520.246,So again the--the bill would increase the office of labor standards budget by 23% from the general Fund and this is to implement --,142,,
1069,0.97,7520.246,7527.987,"Chair Mosqueda, could could I ask a question?",143,,
1070,0.97,7527.987,7528.554,That is fine.,144,,
1071,0.97,7528.554,7530.556,Council member Sawant.,144,,
1072,0.97,7530.556,7546.372,"Tom, you were talking about you just showed the screen of the final page of the memo which is helpful.",145,,
1073,0.97,7546.372,7557.683,"I see 20 million, 770,000 for the Seattle police Department.",145,,
1074,0.97,7557.683,7571.997,I understand there was that much left over in the SPD budget at the end of the year last year that $20 million was added to the SPD budget this year.,145,,
1075,0.97,7571.997,7575.0,Could you explain what is happening there?,145,,
1076,0.97,7575.0,7581.807,I don't think we saw that $20 million authorized in the ordinance.,145,,
1077,0.97,7581.807,7584.443,Did Miss something or did something else happen?,145,,
1078,0.97,7584.443,7590.416,Thank you for the question Council member Sawant.,146,,
1079,0.97,7590.416,7592.518,I can investigate the specific details.,146,,
1080,0.97,7592.518,7603.896,They will be to provide funding for--for authorization--to provide funding in 2021 in this case for either--one of two things.,146,,
1081,0.97,7603.896,7610.703,Either Council authorization that was provided for 2020 that has not been spent by the Department.,146,,
1082,0.97,7610.703,7618.477,A good example of that I am not sure if that is the case in this situation.,146,,
1083,0.97,7618.477,7630.689,It normally will represent grants that were requested and were not fully spent in the prior year and can be from farther back.,146,,
1084,0.97,7630.689,7638.397,Another item is just simply carrying Department budgets.,146,,
1085,0.97,7638.397,7646.372,This is just going kind of deep into the accounting weeds.,146,,
1086,0.97,7646.372,7654.013,It is money to pay vendors or other contract expanses.,146,,
1087,0.97,7654.013,7661.987,City wide accounting will automatically carry those moneys into the budget to ensure our checkbook balance is high enough to pay those expenses.,146,,
1088,0.97,7661.987,7668.594,That being said I can research further and find out the details behind that dollar amount.,146,,
1089,0.97,7668.594,7680.639,I just don't know precisely the elements of that because that was covered in May.,146,,
1090,0.97,7680.639,7685.611,Thank you.,147,,
1091,0.97,7685.611,7685.878,Good yes.,147,,
1092,0.97,7685.878,7687.713,Just a quick follow up.,148,,
1093,0.97,7687.713,7691.917,I would appreciate if you got those details for my office.,148,,
1094,0.97,7691.917,7712.905,I just wanted to say was surprising to see an automatic carry forward of $20 million given that in December of last year the Council was told SPD had over spent their budget and needed an additional $5.4 billion which every Council member but my office voted to grant them.,148,,
1095,0.97,7712.905,7718.577,I'm also concerned there were several pro vise Yous on some part of the police budget.,148,,
1096,0.97,7718.577,7742.101,Council members we all recall spoke at length about how they meant they were following through on community demands to shift these services away from violent policing but does this carry forward mean those previously restricted funds were automatically rolled into this year's budget with all the restrictions lifted?,148,,
1097,0.97,7742.101,7742.468,Or something else?,148,,
1098,0.97,7742.768,7770.496,It would be useful if you could give us technical clarification.,148,,
1099,0.97,7770.496,7771.263,Will do.,149,,
1100,0.97,7771.263,7779.538,I believe we are on bullet two referring to a $9 million increase which is 13% of the Seattle center budget.,149,,
1101,0.97,7779.538,7792.518,It is from a combination of items that the largest is $8 million which is for an--2021 limited tax general obligation fund increase.,149,,
1102,0.97,7792.518,7804.696,This is to pay for Signage there was legislation approved earlier this year tat approved those bonds to be issued in ordinance.,149,,
1103,0.97,7804.696,7810.302,This is SIZING up the budget to administer those funds.,149,,
1104,0.97,7810.302,7819.578,Next again this is in terms of percentage increase.,149,,
1105,0.97,7819.578,7822.814,The 12% increase to the budget.,149,,
1106,0.97,7822.814,7833.325,So this is the next one down.,149,,
1107,0.97,7838.43,7850.175,This is a $48.6 million decrease which is 12% of the budget.,149,,
1108,0.97,7850.175,7854.546,It is a result of--three adjustments.,149,,
1109,0.97,7854.546,7858.116,One of them is a combined adjustment.,149,,
1110,0.97,7858.116,7879.972,You will recall from last fall's budget discussion that--Council approved--Council budget action Fg06B2 which was the Council's Re-Deposit of--general fund money back into the emergency Fund.,149,,
1111,0.97,7879.972,7885.744,The Mayor's proposed budget had used significant moneys from the emergency found balance.,149,,
1112,0.97,7885.744,7895.02,However in the November forecast update the city budget office identified general fund resources would be available.,149,,
1113,0.97,7895.02,7900.659,Council budget action sent those moneys back to the emergency Fund.,149,,
1114,0.97,7900.659,7914.006,"All this does is essentially rather than send the money to the general Fund and then send it back, it just retains $33.7 million in the emergency Fund.",149,,
1115,0.97,7914.006,7918.41,So it accomplishes Council's original intent with your accounting transactions.,149,,
1116,0.97,7918.41,7926.285,So it is a--it is a fairly--it is a fairly large negative reduction.,149,,
1117,0.97,7926.285,7929.154,It is strictly technical in nature.,149,,
1118,0.97,7929.154,7936.261,Similarly there is a $17.5 million technical increase across a couple of bond funds.,149,,
1119,0.97,7936.261,7944.403,This just is done to--formerly--cash transfer money from the funds to the information technology Fund.,149,,
1120,0.97,7944.403,7970.896,As indicated this is a change that is man day-to-day by accounting that--in the past bond moneys were deposited into--and now they are making more Expolice and it trance--explicit and transferring it back.,149,,
1121,0.97,7970.896,7985.544,So some other notable--not necessarily in terms of percentage but in terms of amount is that a $16 million increase to Seattle parks and recreation budget for a number of capital projects.,149,,
1122,0.97,7985.544,8000.092,Large one is about $1.5 million which will be funded from grant revenues that will be discussed in the next section of the presentation about the bill.,149,,
1123,0.97,8000.092,8006.198,There is an $18 million increase into the Department of finance and administrative services.,149,,
1124,0.97,8006.198,8009.768,So this is a net result of a couple of different changes.,149,,
1125,0.97,8009.768,8018.377,The largest of which is a $24.5 million increase for in support of staffing.,149,,
1126,0.97,8018.377,8026.585,Contract and supplies and operation of the city's vaccination sites.,149,,
1127,0.97,8026.585,8036.795,It does intend to apply for Federal Emergency Management agency reimbursements for these costs as they incur them.,149,,
1128,0.97,8036.795,8046.371,Also going into the other direction it is a $6 million reduction from the 2021 West Seattle bridge Fund.,149,,
1129,0.97,8046.371,8055.313,There was an original plan in the budget to issue $6 million of bonds to land--to the market and public development authority.,149,,
1130,0.97,8055.313,8058.55,That is not going to occur this fiscal year.,149,,
1131,0.97,8058.55,8071.029,Fas plans to Repropose it for the 2022 proposed budget but in the meantime they are the budget authority.,149,,
1132,0.97,8071.029,8077.436,Next--we have large dollar changes.,149,,
1133,0.97,8077.436,8081.306,It is a $15 million decrease to the Seattle city light budget.,149,,
1134,0.97,8081.306,8089.614,This is more than this it is explained by the abandonment of capital projects.,149,,
1135,0.97,8089.614,8098.657,There is a whole suite of projects that were not able to be delayed or were either delayed or reduced due to Covid-19.,149,,
1136,0.97,8098.657,8109.468,There is also a--an offsetting increase which is for higher than expected conservation projects and utility.,149,,
1137,0.97,8109.468,8115.34,Sdot budget would increase by 9.7 million across a number of different items.,149,,
1138,0.97,8115.34,8123.982,The notable changes is--it is a--$14.7 million--I say it is a Typo as I'm doing my presentation.,149,,
1139,0.97,8123.982,8143.368,"I believe it is a $14.7 million increase for transit which is $12 million in transportation fund using reimbursements from Seattle city light, Seattle public utilities and Casita Grande.",149,,
1140,0.97,8143.368,8152.644,These are consistent with Sdot's support to Council during consideration the ordinance is 126333.,149,,
1141,0.97,8152.644,8153.011,An ordinance 126334.,149,,
1142,0.97,8153.311,8192.817,These basically increase the port for safety projects and in demand neighborhood projects.,149,,
1143,0.97,8192.817,8207.566,"Then finally kind of going the other Diection, similar to city light there is a $25 million reduction duction that is abandonment of budget authority that is no longer needed in capital projects.",149,,
1144,0.97,8207.566,8226.284,Finally by way of change is--is in the Seattle fire Department there is a $10.1 million total increase in the general fund so $7.9 million is for one item which is the it IMI mentioned earlier.,149,,
1145,0.97,8226.284,8238.263,"It was originally requested $11 million but in the bill as introduced it is now $7.9 million for Covid 9 emergency response costs, testing and vaccines.",149,,
1146,0.97,8238.263,8248.273,The executive does determine these costs will be potentially reimbursed by FEMA.,149,,
1147,0.97,8248.273,8258.516,Other it EMS would include $1.5 million from the Federal homeland security pie you watch program grants.,149,,
1148,0.97,8258.516,8266.191,These grants are accepted in the Council bill 120111.,149,,
1149,0.97,8266.191,8266.992,I will discuss that next.,149,,
1150,0.97,8266.992,8270.929,"So, those are the highlights t large dollar items.",149,,
1151,0.97,8270.929,8282.24,There is a whole assortment of other smaller items that are discussed and described in the attachment to the Summery.,149,,
1152,0.97,8282.24,8287.112,The bill would require three quarters of the Council approval to pass.,149,,
1153,0.97,8287.112,8293.551,I will just pause now to see if there are any questions about the sun Mremental bill.,149,,
1154,0.97,8293.551,8302.127,I do want to note just in terms of process where we are at in the review here.,150,,
1155,0.97,8302.127,8304.829,So we have moved ton item number eight.,150,,
1156,0.97,8304.829,8307.332,We will go quickly to item number seven which is also in the memo.,150,,
1157,0.97,8307.332,8320.445,I want to note as well that there is a handful of amendments that Council members are beginning to flag just for our orientation to how we will consider possible amendments.,150,,
1158,0.97,8320.445,8330.255,If any additional Council men Betters have amendments I would like to have those due to central staff a week from now.,150,,
1159,0.97,8330.255,8332.057,So by noon next Tuesday July 27th.,150,,
1160,0.97,8332.057,8346.971,And again for any Council members not members of the Finance and housing committee I am happy to bring Fortwhard amendment on their behalf recognizing it is ideal to have these discussions as much as possible in the committee setting and so happy to do that for you.,150,,
1161,0.97,8346.971,8354.913,Again if you don't have an amendment today and you are still considering some amendments to this--they are due a week from now.,150,,
1162,0.97,8354.913,8357.949,Please do work with central staff as you Graft those.,150,,
1163,0.97,8357.949,8367.425,We will have a chance to go back and walk through these amendments.,150,,
1164,0.97,8367.425,8369.994,There is a few of those amendments that are included in the memo.,150,,
1165,0.97,8369.994,8376.935,"If we could hold on that for a second and then just get oriented to how those two bills have been introduced, that would be great.",150,,
1166,0.97,8376.935,8382.407,"Vice chair Herbold, did you have a excellent or a question?",150,,
1167,0.97,8382.407,8387.846,I do a question about the bridge Ltgo Fund.,151,,
1168,0.97,8387.846,8394.219,I'm just--I'm loyal confused about how that is described.,151,,
1169,0.97,8394.219,8406.564,It is a reduction of $6 million because of a delay Yans of an issuance of a bond.,151,,
1170,0.97,8406.564,8410.368,It affects the West Seattle Ltgo bridge bond Fund.,151,,
1171,0.97,8410.368,8412.337,Can you help me understand that?,151,,
1172,0.97,8412.337,8419.677,I Dourntd--don't understand it as it is drafted.,151,,
1173,0.97,8419.677,8420.178,Yes.,152,,
1174,0.97,8420.178,8426.451,That is a--that is a confusing one.,152,,
1175,0.97,8426.451,8455.213,This is because the--executive as part of the--West Seattle bridge bond issuance made a change to rename what they were recalling the fund they established so it captured the West Seattle bridge but also captured other items that were included in the--in that bond issuance which this is one of them.,152,,
1176,0.97,8455.213,8462.787,It is kind of a--a mismatch between title and the intended purpose that gets caught up in.,152,,
1177,0.97,8462.787,8468.226,I apologize if you do not remember these specific bill in which that took place.,152,,
1178,0.97,8468.226,8470.528,It was a--I believe last month.,152,,
1179,0.97,8470.528,8475.834,I can follow up with specifics on that.,152,,
1180,0.97,8475.834,8486.578,It is simply just a bit of a--nuance that caught that up.,152,,
1181,0.97,8486.578,8493.618,.,152,,
1182,0.97,8493.618,8494.152,Appreciate that.,153,,
1183,0.97,8494.152,8506.364,I do recollect that legislation I want to confirm this--this legislation would have no impact.,153,,
1184,0.97,8506.364,8512.47,Only reflect as delay of bonds for the market.,153,,
1185,0.97,8512.47,8514.372,That is correct.,154,,
1186,0.97,8514.372,8515.24,Thank you.,155,,
1187,0.97,8515.24,8518.376,I am glad you got that clarification on the record.,155,,
1188,0.97,8518.376,8519.244,Thank you very much.,155,,
1189,0.97,8519.244,8528.086,We are at the top of the revise memo that Aly noted will be posted to the agenda materials as well.,155,,
1190,0.97,8528.086,8531.656,Again all of the materials posted yesterday still accurate.,155,,
1191,0.97,8531.656,8539.097,Just one change to one of the amendments which will discuss in a moment here in terms of the Summery an explanation of that.,155,,
1192,0.97,8539.097,8543.368,Colleagues and members of the public we are at the top of page five of the central staff memo.,155,,
1193,0.97,8543.368,8550.375,We are going back to item number seven which was read into the record as well.,155,,
1194,0.97,8550.375,8550.808,Council bill 120111.,155,,
1195,0.97,8550.808,8552.477,This is the acceptance of the grants.,155,,
1196,0.97,8552.477,8561.653,We will go ahead and walk through the various Questins that folks have on these two bills and possible amendment ideas that Council members have already flagged.,155,,
1197,0.97,8561.653,8581.639,"Just also if we end up not having a sufficient time for the Seattle rescue plan bill number 2, Aly has confirmed that is a relatively short presentation but also are fine to discuss Nit Nit---- it at the whole next meeting which is August 3RD.",155,,
1198,0.97,8581.639,8589.213,If we don't get to the last item it is also okay.,155,,
1199,0.97,8589.213,8591.249,With that lets review item number 7.,155,,
1200,0.97,8591.249,8600.224,Again at the top of page 5.,155,,
1201,0.97,8600.224,8600.491,Okay.,156,,
1202,0.97,8600.491,8600.792,Thank you.,156,,
1203,0.97,8600.792,8606.864,"So Council bill 2111, item 7 is the midyear grant acceptance legislation.",156,,
1204,0.97,8606.864,8613.871,This bill would accept $23.3 million from a variety of external sources.,156,,
1205,0.97,8613.871,8620.378,The bulk of this is then appropriated in the midyear supplemental appropriation bill.,156,,
1206,0.97,8620.378,8632.156,In fact many of the large amounts you will see on this table are in areas that I did highlight in the supplemental discussion.,156,,
1207,0.97,8632.156,8637.629,Council central staff did not flag any areas of concern for these items.,156,,
1208,0.97,8637.629,8655.747,I will note the bulk of this is for transportation projects and about nearly half or approximately half is from Federal highway administration grants that fund projects and Sdot.,156,,
1209,0.97,8655.747,8660.151,Also Seattle fire Department has $1.8 million worth of grants from a variety of sources.,156,,
1210,0.97,8660.151,8665.323,The largest of which is the grant I noted previously.,156,,
1211,0.97,8665.323,8672.397,Then finally Seattle parks and recreation has $3.6 million grants from sources.,156,,
1212,0.97,8672.397,8685.209,The largest of which is $1.9 million--near Ly $2.9 million from the Department of Commerce.,156,,
1213,0.97,8685.209,8714.706,So again similarly there--each one of these is detailed in the Summery attachment to the fiscal NOTE and happy to follow up or provide response if there is questions about any of the individual items or amounts shown here.,156,,
1214,0.97,8714.706,8726.818,If there are questions I can walk through the potential amendments that suits the chair.,156,,
1215,0.97,8726.818,8727.552,That sounds good.,157,,
1216,0.97,8727.552,8738.863,I want to thank you for flag some early amendment ideas.,157,,
1217,0.97,8738.863,8760.985,I think this also a good Governance strike Thatty and transparent budgeting process that allows for us to have greater assurances for how these dollars spent so we can look back at them and ask some of these critical questions that have already been asked today.,157,,
1218,0.97,8760.985,8770.928,And I think it will help streamline these conversations.,157,,
1219,0.97,8770.928,8776.267,This is I think going to create great stability.,157,,
1220,0.97,8776.267,8782.306,"Thanks for that work central staff and I will turn it back over to you, Aly.",157,,
1221,0.97,8782.306,8785.676,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,158,,
1222,0.97,8785.676,8794.952,There are eight potential amendments identified today.,158,,
1223,0.97,8794.952,8818.376,"-- as chair Mosqueda high light if there are additional amendments Council members would like to see on August 3RD, please let us know by noon on July 27th.",158,,
1224,0.97,8818.376,8821.879,So the first amendment is sponsored by chair Mosqueda.,158,,
1225,0.97,8821.879,8827.084,"This would add $50,000 and one position to the fire Department for mental health nurse.",158,,
1226,0.97,8827.084,8835.66,This would be in addition to a similar position that with us was added by Council action in the 2021 adopted budget.,158,,
1227,0.97,8835.66,8861.385,"Thatis supporting the health care trust in the fire Department but it has been through conversations with the fire Department additional resources are needed so this would provide funding to fill a second position this year, create the position and--[Indiscernible] chair Mosqueda would you like me to pause between amendments to allow the sponsor to speak to it or do you want --",158,,
1228,0.97,8861.385,8865.256,"Yes, please that would be welcomed.",159,,
1229,0.97,8865.256,8866.858,"If there is any additional context, please feel free.",159,,
1230,0.97,8866.858,8870.094,I do not have any additional context on this one.,159,,
1231,0.97,8870.094,8874.465,Just to let folks know that this is pretty straightforward.,159,,
1232,0.97,8874.465,8894.819,"We have all seen a tremendous need for there to be mental health counseling for folks who have been responding to the Covid crisis and compounding crisis in terms of lack of access to affordable housing, mental health services and chemical dependency needs.",159,,
1233,0.97,8894.819,8902.293,So we heard a lot about this in last year's budget.,159,,
1234,0.97,8902.293,8907.531,I want to thank Council member Herbold for her continued interest in this as well.,159,,
1235,0.97,8907.531,8931.222,"The need for a fire Department personnel to be able to access those mental health counseling services and make sure that we reduced any Bay barriers, I think there is recognition that greater access too a mental health counselor will be sought by members of front line firefighters if it was housed within the trust.",159,,
1236,0.97,8931.222,8942.767,There is agreement to move those remaining dollars over to the trust so that that firefighters have access to mental health and routine physical services.,159,,
1237,0.97,8942.767,8946.837,"That is a great way to connect the mind, body and make sure people are all healthy.",159,,
1238,0.97,8947.138,8948.239,They with them.,160,,
1239,0.97,8996.987,9002.626,And thank you for that very lovely colleagues.,160,,
1240,0.97,9002.626,9003.694,Thank you.,161,,
1241,0.97,9003.694,9007.231,Amendment two.,161,,
1242,0.97,9007.231,9040.564,"Proposed by the vice chair to read $300,000 for the communications and safety center . and for the 9-1-1 Dispatchers, this would provide a more consistent way to obtain key information from the information centers . as well as helping with alternatives to police response.",161,,
1243,0.97,9040.564,9041.565,Thank you so much.,162,,
1244,0.97,9041.565,9044.368,I'm really excited about this.,162,,
1245,0.97,9044.368,9058.682,"Originally, we were thinking about maybe making enhancements to the dispatch protocols in 2022.",162,,
1246,0.97,9058.682,9084.542,"We were thinking we would be considering funding to do so in our budget deliberations for 2022. now that the Council has fully authorize the transfer of the 911 call center through the community safety and communications center, there is no need to wait until January of 2022 to upgrade the proposals.",162,,
1247,0.97,9084.542,9113.771,"Carol Lombard says it should be upgraded before the safety and communications centers starts dispatching alternative police responses . So, it is so important to our effort to begin to match more 911 calls with Nonpolice responses . This is considered a best practice.",162,,
1248,0.97,9113.771,9134.325,The use of these protocols to identify a pattern for specific types of calls which really help the safety agencies like the FCC to determine how and when to appropriate the sometimes limited resources of Nonpolice response.,162,,
1249,0.97,9134.325,9159.416,"Ultimately, this kind of system would help the community safety and communications center to continually evaluate the kinds of calls that do not need an armed response . The 911 center does not currently use this protocol center that this funding would support.",162,,
1250,0.97,9159.416,9162.62,"Currently, the Dispatchers obtain information through something more like a guided discussion.",162,,
1251,0.97,9162.62,9174.698,This does not allow for analysis.,162,,
1252,0.97,9174.698,9176.934,"The director recommends a protocol system, as soon as is possible.",162,,
1253,0.97,9176.934,9185.943,Investing in this type of system will provide the time and resources for providing staff when alternatives are available.,162,,
1254,0.97,9185.943,9194.351,"In addition, the Procol can be easily adapted and modified for alternative police response.",162,,
1255,0.97,9194.351,9208.666,"Again, I am excited that we are cutting the time that we were originally considering for this next important step by several months and moving forward on it.",162,,
1256,0.97,9208.666,9218.876,Thank you.,162,,
1257,0.97,9222.112,9224.515,Thank you very much Councilmember Herbold for that in the explanation.,163,,
1258,0.97,9224.515,9225.749,Now let's move to number three.,163,,
1259,0.97,9225.749,9227.785,I do not see additional Hands- on number 2.,163,,
1260,0.97,9227.785,9233.157,"So, amendment 3 is proposed by Councilmember Gonzales.",164,,
1261,0.97,9233.157,9240.464,It is to create a new budget for the office of economic and revenue forecast.,164,,
1262,0.97,9240.464,9256.513,"Just yesterday, the council passed 12024 this amendment would take the initial budget actions to be able to implement that office by creating the structure in order to hire the director.",164,,
1263,0.97,9256.513,9276.033,We anticipate the additional budget actions will be needed in the year in supplemental as well as the 2022 proposed budget to transfer funds already reserved in the 2021 adopted budget to support this new office.,164,,
1264,0.97,9276.033,9284.842,Now I will turn it over to Councilmember Gonzalez.,164,,
1265,0.97,9284.842,9286.11,Not much more to add.,165,,
1266,0.97,9286.11,9287.945,I think we talked about this briefly on Monday.,165,,
1267,0.97,9287.945,9300.024,"Certainly in committee . So, this follows through on the need to implement the intent behind the legislation that we passed on Monday.",165,,
1268,0.97,9300.024,9302.359,Thank you again for your leadership on this.,166,,
1269,0.97,9302.359,9304.762,Thank you.,167,,
1270,0.97,9304.762,9313.337,So amendment 4 also sponsored by Councilmember Gonzalez.,167,,
1271,0.97,9313.337,9323.48,It would provide resources for the resource disclosure and Tech knowledge he.,167,,
1272,0.97,9323.48,9333.49,It is meant to broadly enhance and prepare the city to be able to respond to those requests and to ensure there are systems in place.,167,,
1273,0.97,9333.49,9338.362,Any additional comments on that?,168,,
1274,0.97,9338.362,9370.961,"Yes . This is in direct response to much of the reporting we have seen related to the technology issues that have been surfaced and have led to the loss of certain public records . This is an effort, again, to create a down payment opportunity to identify additional resources to fund what has been identified by I.T.",169,,
1275,0.97,9370.961,9405.629,"To address those gaps and to make sure we are retaining public records as opposed potentially losing some of those public records to technology failures that are out of control to the user with these devices . You will notice there is not a dollar amount identified and that is because we are working to continue to evaluate and analyze exactly what the cost is . in the spirit of putting out a Placeholder, we have identified this as a need.",169,,
1276,0.97,9405.629,9416.039,Thank you very much.,170,,
1277,0.97,9418.442,9432.456,"Okay, the next amendment also proposed by Councilmember Gonzalez would add to the legislative Department for the staff of city auditor . like all departments across the city, they took a reduction in their base budget to address the overall city revenue shortfalls.",170,,
1278,0.97,9432.456,9439.563,And the office of the city auditor was among the divisions that took a budget reduction.,170,,
1279,0.97,9439.563,9473.497,"It was assumed the reduction could be absorbed in that office . because the bulk of the resources for the city auditor is for staff and due to staff costs because of separations, they are not able to absorb the cost and pay employees toward the end of the year . This would add funds to ensure there are adequate resources to staff the office of the city auditor and technology this year.",170,,
1280,0.97,9473.497,9479.937,"It is also noted this will be an ongoing need in 2022, to continue to have the budget to support that office.",170,,
1281,0.97,9479.937,9484.708,Is there anything additional on this?,171,,
1282,0.97,9484.708,9530.854,"Thank you for highlighting that . It has been identified as a very high need for the office of the city auditor . and, I think he has been very nimble with some impending retirements and other staffing changes to not compromise the functions of the city auditor's office . But, with the volume of requests that the city auditor receives for independent audits, both from the city Council and the budget process, I think it is critical we restore funding in order to not compromise the work and functions of the city auditor for office.",172,,
1283,0.97,9530.854,9547.871,"With that, I want to congratulate auditor Jones and team . They will be experiencing those retirements that the Council President just mentioned.",173,,
1284,0.97,9547.871,9552.709,Thank you to all the team and good luck as they had to retirement.,173,,
1285,0.97,9552.709,9585.442,So amendment 6 is proposed by Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Peterson . This would add to the legislative Department for a position that would report to the chair of the select Committee on homelessness to monitor homelessness investments . I will turn it over to you.,174,,
1286,0.97,9585.442,9589.346,"My screen was not big enough, I apologize.",174,,
1287,0.97,9589.346,9589.947,Thank you.,175,,
1288,0.97,9589.947,9594.251,I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this amendment.,175,,
1289,0.97,9594.251,9627.284,"Councilmember Pedersen and I discussed this about tiny House villages in our respective villages that have been delayed considerably, beyond the initial already generous Timelines of when they were Úsupposed to be opened . This, I addition to lots of Timeline issues surrounding the Council's investments.",175,,
1290,0.97,9627.284,9648.472,"And with the resources, all of the fundamental emergency shelter resources this Council has funded . The delay of which has left our homeless crisis without the essential resources to respond quickly and compassionately to the need we see on the streets every day.",175,,
1291,0.97,9648.472,9696.319,"Councilmember Pedersen and I risk reflected on the enormous amount of our time and the time of our staff running down these investments in identifying the decision points in the intergovernmental hurdles that are currently delaying these projects to a considerable amount of time . We think that due to the absence, partly because of some kind of oversight resource . You know, I think this position is important, just because of the capacity strain the subject is putting on my office and a couple of additional offices who are desperately pursuing these added sheltered resources for their districts.",175,,
1292,0.97,9696.319,9707.464,It is limited instead of permanent . given I think we will have a massive influx of shelter over the next few years.,175,,
1293,0.97,9707.464,9736.493,"It will then taper off as Sarah will hopefully be an expansion of other homeless investment and make the shelter less essential and will be more toward sustaining the expanded shelter system . As we go toward that, it will be important to have the additional capacity and to put a pin on how important this plan is to the Council to have this emergency shelter.",175,,
1294,0.97,9736.493,9755.779,"Given that 80% of what this Council is struggling with, it seems, is the homelessness crisis . So, this is a position to help manage, specifically, those investments that are the heart and crop of the homelessness emergency response.",175,,
1295,0.97,9755.779,9911.067,"That to date, very little of that resource has stood up to what the Council the Council.",175,,
1296,0.97,9911.067,9925.915,My agreement about the frustration that you and others have experienced.,176,,
1297,0.97,9925.915,9929.252,I also want to thank the central staff for their Deliberative efforts to get information there.,176,,
1298,0.97,9929.252,9940.897,"That is concerning, to try to find corrective action . I appreciate that and I hear the frustration.",176,,
1299,0.97,9940.897,9949.272,"The only thing I might add, and I appreciate your comments on this.",177,,
1300,0.97,9949.272,9962.919,The only thing I would add is that I see this as more of an investment in the oversight rather than the analysis function of the Council.,177,,
1301,0.97,9962.919,9966.623,"Which I think is one of the things we are missing on this particular space, right now.",177,,
1302,0.97,9966.623,9975.432,I think it is best to explain in terms of the hurdles that these investments are facing.,177,,
1303,0.97,9975.432,9980.937,I do believe people are making good faith efforts to get these investments stood up.,177,,
1304,0.97,9980.937,9994.617,"I think what has been occurring and has been occurring in a lot of cases, is a lot of the processes will get bogged down.",177,,
1305,0.97,9994.617,10002.459,Then just to use the analogy that it is difficult to determine at all times where it is.,177,,
1306,0.97,10002.459,10055.011,"Whether it is in Seattle or in transit negotiation .. they will get stuck in boxes with various agencies . given how important these investments are and where we are in the state of homelessness, I think it is an important gap . having this oversight role missing has allowed several additional months of time to pass on the implementation of these things because we don't have the resource to perform the oversight function sufficient to move through these processes.",177,,
1307,0.97,10055.011,10057.981,I wanted to provide that additional context and agree it is a unique position.,177,,
1308,0.97,10057.981,10070.76,I also think it is something that we need to move forward on.,177,,
1309,0.97,10073.363,10121.644,"I just want to make sure that we are not creating insurmountable expectations . I think central staff does have the ability and has functioned to that of know, when we have asked, where spending implementation is by working with the executive departments to get that information . So, just weeks ago, we requested a summary from central staff on the spending and estimates that were implemented . and not yet implemented in this area of homelessness investments.",178,,
1310,0.97,10121.644,10126.583,"Within a couple of days, that information was turned around.",178,,
1311,0.97,10126.583,10183.773,"Similarly, when you want to drill down--sort of on the big picture, getting the oversight associated with how many hours are allocated versus how much has actually been spent . If you want to look at individual projects, and you want central staff to drill down on individual projects, they will serve that function as well . I am concerned we are creating potential in the expectations of oversight that is really bounded by the executive Department and that the the executive Department is the Implementer . So, I'm interested in finding out more about the vision for this position.",178,,
1312,0.97,10183.773,10198.755,"Again, I am just concerned that we might be expecting something that might be very, very difficult to deliver, given the current situation that we see ourselves in.",178,,
1313,0.97,10198.755,10219.142,Thank you . I appreciate those questions and I also do want to into the discussion on this by saying that those frustrations are real and have been experienced by the central staff and the Council across the board.,179,,
1314,0.97,10219.142,10222.045,The need for a different response is absolutely accurate.,179,,
1315,0.97,10222.045,10225.248,I think trying to get to the solution is where we need continued discussion.,179,,
1316,0.97,10225.248,10231.955,Thank you very much Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Pedersen.,179,,
1317,0.97,10231.955,10244.067,"Since this impacts how we are structuring the Council central staff, I want to make a few comments as the Council President.",180,,
1318,0.97,10244.067,10260.984,"Really, I think that I had a chance to talk to Councilmember Lewis with his Brainstorming session with Councilmember Pedersen in his amendment.",180,,
1319,0.97,10260.984,10285.508,"What is important to me is to walk away with sort of the understanding that we continue to, on the Council level, have a lot of demands on sort of how we are allocating and making resource decisions in terms of the most valuable asset which is the time of the staff members.",180,,
1320,0.97,10285.508,10311.267,"So, in thinking about how we supplement the capacity of folks like Jeff Sims and Tracy Radcliffe, and others, who already do support the Council on making sure we have a good understanding of how our investments are being implemented . I think that is sort of at the crux of this proposed amendment.",180,,
1321,0.97,10311.267,10361.217,"There may be an opportunity to have a conversation about whether this is the right structure or do it like we did in the context of the capital projects . having an interdepartmental and interbranch monitoring team that you know, sort of contains in the spirit of Accessing timely information to make sure we are on the same page with how investments are being deployed with some of the sort of critical areas of investment for the city . in that case, it was around capital projects and I think the need is around power and investments in the homelessness being deployed.",180,,
1322,0.97,10361.217,10394.317,"I hope we could continue to have a conversation about sort of the need and continuing to refine the concept around, how do we best achieve the goal of getting timely information and making sure that the Council central staff is Resourced appropriately to staff this critical area of high priority for the Council.",180,,
1323,0.97,10394.317,10404.46,"Thank you for those summary comments, well said . and Councilmember Lewis, thank you for walking us through this.",181,,
1324,0.97,10404.46,10410.166,Let's go to number 7.,181,,
1325,0.97,10410.166,10416.472,"The next amendment, amendment 7 is authored by Councilmember Sawant.",182,,
1326,0.97,10416.472,10434.357,"It provides $500,000 to the parks Department and it cuts from the Seattle police Department budget . The proposed $500,000 is to support the Superblock organization and the Predevelopment work for this project.",182,,
1327,0.97,10434.357,10439.162,Including the cost of construction and permitting.,182,,
1328,0.97,10439.162,10447.37,The campus is comprised of a number of resources including a community center and pool.,182,,
1329,0.97,10447.37,10456.779,There are tennis courts adjoining the park and also the ball field and other resources.,182,,
1330,0.97,10456.779,10465.988,The proposed project includes site improvements throughout the park and a Pathway to reflect the cultural arts and heritage of the central area.,182,,
1331,0.97,10465.988,10501.257,"The proposed cut of $500,000 is predicated on proposed cuts previously considered in Council bill 11981 that was not passed by the Council . I will also note that I just heard in discussion of this amendment, after the memo was published with executive staff, I understand this is flagged as a priority, as well, for the 2010 he--2020 proposed budget.",182,,
1332,0.97,10503.392,10513.536,"Councilmember Sawant, thank you for joining us . please go ahead.",183,,
1333,0.97,10513.536,10514.136,Thank you.,184,,
1334,0.97,10514.136,10518.374,I want to at community input in favor of this budget amendment.,184,,
1335,0.97,10518.374,10545.301,"As explained, this would take $500,000 that the super hot block park needs to become shuttle ready . It would free up the funding for the Garfield Superblock by Garnering $500,000 from the police Department budget . It comprises the Garfield community center and the pool as well as the tennis courts and the adjoining park.",184,,
1336,0.97,10545.301,10559.282,That includes the historic Garfield ball fields in the Quincy Jones performing arts center as well as Dragon field.,184,,
1337,0.97,10559.282,10568.991,The staff memo describes the project with site improvements throughout the park and the creation of a Pathway that integrates arts and amenities that integrate the art of the area.,184,,
1338,0.97,10568.991,10576.532,There would be development work for this area.,184,,
1339,0.97,10576.532,10615.338,"It is a grassroots effort to create a vital civic space that honors and tells the story of the people who have lived there over the many a millennia . The Garfield Superblock, working with staff from the parks and recreation to Hartman aims to enhance the area around the community center, pool and the Garfield high school with art that Delineates the history and with new trees and sidewalks to ensure access for new, safe publicly accessible bathroom facilities . It is precisely the kind of project that should be funded.",184,,
1340,0.97,10615.338,10637.66,"Especially in areas like that district, but throughout the city . We are confident it will be a community jam and will likely be emulated by other communities . Unfortunately, many such projects in Working- class communities have a lack of funding over the last 15 years.",184,,
1341,0.97,10637.66,10642.965,That is what has happened to the Garfield Superblock.,184,,
1342,0.97,10642.965,10648.204,"Even though this idea has been in existence 15 years, it has been a struggle for funding.",184,,
1343,0.97,10648.204,10678.834,It is at a really good point and it is exactly the kind of community project that is also in line with the demands of the black lives matter protests . It is basically shifting money and public resources away from the police Department budget to community needs which goes toward addressing public safety.,184,,
1344,0.97,10678.834,10689.445,The vast majority of the Council promised and it is less than 1% of the budget.,184,,
1345,0.97,10689.445,10692.314,It is not what was promised last December.,184,,
1346,0.97,10692.314,10701.724,"In fact, we know that amount and the fact that the Department illegally spent more than they had.",184,,
1347,0.97,10701.724,10718.274,"It is a small amount and less than the 10% of the promise $5.4 million . It is a drop in the bucket if you look at the overall police budget . But, it would mean everything to make the Garfield Superblock ready.",184,,
1348,0.97,10718.274,10720.543,It enjoys community support.,184,,
1349,0.97,10720.543,10730.753,I've seen this for myself by having spoken to dozens of community members about this issue.,184,,
1350,0.97,10730.753,10741.797,Specifically Stephanie Ingram and Robert Stephens Jr. and others who are in favor of the Garfield Superblock.,184,,
1351,0.97,10741.797,10753.476,"I wanted to thank all community members, including the activists like Triano holiday and the others from the Africa line trust.",184,,
1352,0.97,10753.476,10762.818,There have been many others who have been local sports Spokespeople for this project.,184,,
1353,0.97,10762.818,10778.601,"With the organizing support, they have collected 576 signatures to support this Poject . Many petition signers added perspectives about why they feel they should fund the Superblock.",184,,
1354,0.97,10778.601,10782.671,I want to read three very quickly.,184,,
1355,0.97,10782.671,10793.015,"Valentina wrote, this is long overdue and the central district community has been voicing their request for an improved Park for decades.",184,,
1356,0.97,10793.015,10798.754,This honors those voices and honors the cultural diversity and resilience of the area.,184,,
1357,0.97,10798.754,10808.931,"And Jennifer wrote, the Garfield Superblock is so important for honoring black folks in Seattle.",184,,
1358,0.97,10808.931,10814.67,And looking at the negative impacts of Gentrification.,184,,
1359,0.97,10814.67,10822.945,Using funds given to cops is a powerful gesture.,184,,
1360,0.97,10822.945,10829.652,It speaks to the January insurrection.,184,,
1361,0.97,10829.652,10834.757,"As we make our way toward the goal of funding the Garfield Superblock, it's a powerful gesture to support Seattle.",184,,
1362,0.97,10834.757,10846.402,"And Gerald wrote, investing in the community is one of the few ways to fight Gentrification in the central district's culture.",184,,
1363,0.97,10846.402,10860.182,"As a teacher at the high school, I have seen how the city's growth has disproportionately impacted the black and Brown community.",184,,
1364,0.97,10860.182,10869.024,This is just a glimpse of the committee community comments we have received as well as the community members who have spoken to me and my staff about this project.,184,,
1365,0.97,10869.024,10883.405,We also have a representative from the parks Department to speak . It was in support of this amendment and it is an important community resource.,184,,
1366,0.97,10883.405,10884.24,Thank you.,184,,
1367,0.97,10884.24,10894.416,"Colleagues, are there questions about the summary here? I will Chime in with one question.",185,,
1368,0.97,10894.416,10905.327,"Councilmember and potentially Allie, it sounds like there is a discrepancy with what the executive noted with land dollars.",186,,
1369,0.97,10905.327,10943.799,"In Councilmember two, 34, it sounds like you are trying to get it through the Predevelopment phase so that it is ready . We did this with a handful of projects . I'm trying to think of examples, but we paid for the shovel ready element when the funding came through, the project was ready to go . I direct that tore the author of the amendment and Allie, maybe I could get some information from you . is that to pay for the Predevelopment costs and if there are additional costs for the construction that it would come later?",186,,
1370,0.97,10943.799,10947.603,"Yes, you are right.",187,,
1371,0.97,10947.603,10959.014,I understand where the discrepancy is coming from and I think it is in alignment with what we have done before to get projects shovel ready to be ready for additional departmental investments.,188,,
1372,0.97,10959.014,10962.785,"Allie, is that correct?",188,,
1373,0.97,10962.785,10967.89,Is there anything you would like to correct on my end?,188,,
1374,0.97,10967.89,10980.803,"It wasn't actually a discrepancy between the amendment and what I sort of generally referred to as the total cost . The project, in general, is identified as a priority.",189,,
1375,0.97,10980.803,10982.171,This amount would be consistent.,189,,
1376,0.97,10982.171,10998.821,"Whether or not this amendment moves forward, I think that right now the Mayor is considering whether or not to Prioritize it in the proposed budget . I know it has been identified by executive staff as a priority.",189,,
1377,0.97,10998.821,11017.172,"So, if this money was for now, I think we would expect to see additional funds to continue implementation of the project, as you said, in the 2022 proposed budget where the Council may contemplate changes.",189,,
1378,0.97,11017.172,11017.74,"Okay, thanks.",190,,
1379,0.97,11017.74,11019.007,Are there additional questions?,190,,
1380,0.97,11019.007,11020.542,I don't see any.,190,,
1381,0.97,11020.542,11038.36,Thank you Councilmember Strauss for Authoring that . Allie and team for making it possible to have these hybrid sort of discussions among the Councilmembers.,190,,
1382,0.97,11038.36,11043.532,The last one is from a member of the city council with not a usual member of the housing and Finance Committee.,190,,
1383,0.97,11043.532,11056.078,"I don't believe Councilmember Pedersen is here today, but I'm happy to have the discussion as a preview . back to you, Allie.",190,,
1384,0.97,11056.078,11070.893,Number 8 would add two positions in the Seattle police Department . One position for crime prevention coordinator to work with the community and the North precinct to reduce and prevent crime.,191,,
1385,0.97,11070.893,11079.301,Spd has currently six positions and one is at each precinct.,191,,
1386,0.97,11079.301,11086.008,The existing position is vacant and they are in the process of filling a second position to serve areas north of the canal.,191,,
1387,0.97,11086.008,11126.381,"The second civilian position would be a strategic advisor 2 to facilitate communication between the Department, the community, and our accountability and oversight agencies with the city . The intent of the author is that the positions in 2021 could be funded using the salary savings achieved due to the delay in hiring the existing position they are currently in the process of filling . and requests that ongoing funding isn't looted and the Mayor's 2022 proposed budget.",191,,
1388,0.97,11126.381,11133.555,"It would have authority for the proposed civilian positions, but it would not increase the budget for SPD.",191,,
1389,0.97,11133.555,11151.306,"Thank you very much . I don't believe Councilmember Pedersen is with us . I will just check my screen . colleagues, are there any questions on this amendment that Councilmember Pedersen has authored?",192,,
1390,0.97,11151.306,11173.629,"Thank you . I'm trying to understand the thinking behind this, if you know, Allie . I have been--Councilmember Pedersen I have been trying to talk about this.",193,,
1391,0.97,11173.629,11181.069,"It adds not only funding, but authority . is the idea the funding would be provided in the 2022 budget?",193,,
1392,0.97,11181.069,11192.381,"Councilmember Herbold, that is it . The funding for the positions would be using existing salary savings in the SPD budget.",194,,
1393,0.97,11192.381,11203.759,They have not filled the North end civilian position which was funded for a full year.,194,,
1394,0.97,11203.759,11215.437,"Then, the expectation would be that ongoing funding would be including in the SPD budget for 2022.",194,,
1395,0.97,11215.437,11217.673,Just so I understand it.,195,,
1396,0.97,11217.673,11237.059,There is existing funding because the funded North precinct--I thought that position was not funded . that was one of the positions I was proposing to fund with my budget bill earlier this year.,195,,
1397,0.97,11237.059,11258.513,I know they are working on hiring that person . My recollection was there was a North precinct advisory crime prevention coordinator position as well as a couple of Csl positions that were being held vacant because there was not funding for those positions.,195,,
1398,0.97,11258.513,11292.614,"If there was funding, I could understand why there is interest in creating another position to use that remaining funding to hire for a second position . They have not hired for the year . again, it is my recollection that these positions require funding in 2021 to hire for 2021.",195,,
1399,0.97,11292.614,11303.659,"So, at this stage in the amendment development, we are in general presenting the Councilmember's intent.",196,,
1400,0.97,11303.659,11309.731,We have yet to look to see if the resources are available.,196,,
1401,0.97,11309.731,11319.741,"If fully funded, salary savings can be used for other purposes, as long as they are consistent with the budget summary level.",196,,
1402,0.97,11319.741,11345.667,"With this specific position under discussion, it was funded in the 2021 budget . We are still confirming . I want to reiterate that the author's intent is that these new positions would be funded using salary savings from existing other civilian positions.",196,,
1403,0.97,11345.667,11348.003,We will get clarity to confirm whether or not these are available.,196,,
1404,0.97,11348.003,11358.914,"Providing the position of Doherty would allow the Department to fill those positions, if they have resources available in the Department.",196,,
1405,0.97,11358.914,11366.288,We will follow up with more details on the specifics whether or not the existing position was fully funded.,196,,
1406,0.97,11366.288,11404.626,"Again, my recollection is the way that the Mayor's office found salary savings in her proposed 2021 SPD budget was by basically doing a hiring freeze and scooping significant resources from civilian positions . The reason I have this recollection is because the budget bill that I proposed earlier this year was to fund those existing positions that did not have funding.",197,,
1407,0.97,11404.626,11421.843,"So, we need to either find out more about this . I also want to flag we are adding a new geographically based position that does not already exist.",197,,
1408,0.97,11421.843,11430.786,I think there might need to be conversations that we need to have about that.,197,,
1409,0.97,11430.786,11445.3,I think we should be adding decisions about geographically based decisions associated with the understanding the need for geographically based positions.,197,,
1410,0.97,11445.3,11467.589,I would not be surprised if public safety advocates and other precincts might also argue there should be additional civilian positions created . I want to understand what the sort of basis is for adding a position in the North precinct?,197,,
1411,0.97,11467.589,11487.042,"As I have said, I have expressed my support for funding the existing North precinct advisory . I'm sorry, the coordinator position . also as it relates specifically to the accountability agency liaison position.",197,,

1413,0.97,11494.015,11511.933,I have talked with the CPC about their needs to broaden their relationships with folks who are working on policy within SPD.,197,,
1414,0.97,11511.933,11536.658,"When I have had conversations about a potential liaison position within SPD in the past, the concern they expressed to me was they don't want another Gatekeeper . what they want to do is have better relationships with a number of different folks to work on policy within SPD . There is a concern that if there is a designated liaison that it might create more barriers.",197,,
1415,0.97,11536.658,11560.582,I know the Councilmember Pedersen has talked with them and their position may have evolved since I last talked with them . I would like to learn more from Councilmember Pedersen about his vision for this.,197,,

1422,0.97,11620.141,11635.457,To the issue I was raising earlier about the tiny House villages and some other things being stood up is there is considerable amount of one time lenders spend . The Councilmembers assumed in the budgeting that this would be open in January.,200,,
1423,0.97,11635.457,11642.664,It looks likely the tiny House villages will not be open until significantly later this year.,200,,
1424,0.97,11642.664,11668.623,"For many, a half year is gone where the operating funds will not be used for the tiny House purposes . I think it makes sense, given there are other needs in our housing and human services Stakeholder community that could be addressed to capture some of that understand to address the one-time costs.",200,,
1425,0.97,11668.623,11674.329,Like some unanticipated costs with the 80 units.,200,,

1436,0.97,11745.467,11754.876,It is the same for vice chair Herbold . is this a hardship for you as well?,204,,
1437,0.97,11754.876,11757.979,"Allie, would you like to use the next 10-15 minutes to describe the last item?",204,,
1438,0.97,11757.979,11764.886,Really quickly . I don't need 10 minutes . I was just going to describe what is in the memo.,205,,
1439,0.97,11764.886,11770.992,"You can read that, but I want to make sure it is clear on the process.",205,,

This is following up on the rescue plan passed by Council in June . as well as accepting an additional Rant the city has received from the appropriations act of 2021. it provides details of what we expect to see . that includes a target date for emergency rental assistance as well as transportation funds . There may potentially be another Rant related to small businesses and shuttered to Venues . We are still trying to understand the details of whether we will have that in time for inclusion in this bill . This is similar to previous legislation where the bill will accept the grants and authorize spending.,209,,
1445,0.97,11847.468,11853.775,"Again, this is similar to targeted aid and there are limitations on what the money can be used for.",209,,
1446,0.97,11853.775,11871.226,"It will outline the Council's expectations for how the funds are deployed . If there are specific interests that you have and how the direction is provided to the executive, please work with essential staff.",209,,

1459,0.97,11960.915,11989.811,"In the rescue plan legislation, I introduced mental health issues that are the result of the pandemic and social isolate is Asian in the last year and a half . to know whether or not anything in the guidance, so far, that we have seen, constrains us from using these funds for addressing mental health with seniors? I don't need the answer now, but I am wanting the question on the record.",211,,
1460,0.97,11989.811,12001.522,Thank you . Thank you for being a strong champion around those dollars as well . I see Allie taking notes on that and perhaps more information is to come on that.,212,,
