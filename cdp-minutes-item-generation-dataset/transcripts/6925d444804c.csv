85,0.97,653.219,680.746,"We have the upper Skagit office which is--in 2013 when we initially found the artifacts, all three of these tribes were interested because they all had treaty rights and usual gathering areas in the Skagit valley.",9,,
86,0.97,680.746,691.424,As chair Nelson indicated we have done extensive research and determined the artifacts are most closely associated with the upper Skagit tribe.,9,,
87,0.97,691.424,711.01,"They are known to have had a permanent winter village where the town currently sits and those artifacts, are most closely associated with the permanent village rather than migratory and seasonal campsites for hunting and gathering.",9,,
88,0.97,711.01,727.493,The evidence in the Ethnographic record is pretty conclusive about the close association with the upper Skagit tribe.,9,,

102,0.97,797.363,808.541,"Diana, who is a member and part of the legal team on the Skagit project and the only member of the original legal team that we retained when we made our switching Council about a year ago.",15,,

109,0.97,842.808,850.95,"Next slide, please.",16,,
110,0.97,850.95,852.484,This is just to give you some orientation about where the project is.,16,,
111,0.97,852.484,882.281,"The slide on the left is what the gorge Inn looked like before renovations . It was lifted up and it is and is stored dining hall that originally served the workers who constructed the hydroelectric project and now it serves our operations staff, who many are living in the town of new haven Irma and another bunch of contractors that come up that come to work on the hydroelectric facilities are most recently the licensing for the Skagit project.",16,,
112,0.97,882.281,887.786,We have researchers in the valley right now.,16,,
113,0.97,887.786,889.588,The photo on the right is what it looks like today with a few additional plantings.,16,,
114,0.97,889.588,890.155,It is a beautiful spot.,16,,
115,0.97,890.155,892.024,I encourage you to see it.,16,,
116,0.97,892.024,896.295,Next slide.,16,,
117,0.97,896.295,899.131,This is an example of some of the artifacts that were found.,16,,
118,0.97,899.131,913.078,"Most of them are more like the ones on the left side of your screen, rock chips and material that has been worked and it is easy to tell it has been.",16,,
119,0.97,913.078,932.831,"There is a small piece on the left upper left-hand corner that is a finer point and that has been Replicated and is on a sign, interpretive sign, so people can see what the materials are like when we do archaeological digs . It was done on a 3-D printer.",16,,
120,0.97,932.831,940.205,The most significant Artifact is the stone club you see on the right-hand side of your screen.,16,,
121,0.97,940.205,949.581,That is the Artifact that would be most closely associated with a permanent village rather than a camp or other historical activity.,16,,
122,0.97,949.581,953.552,"Next slide, please.",16,,
123,0.97,953.552,969.601,There were 270 artifacts approximately that were related to prehistoric or Pre-Contact time periods.,16,,
124,0.97,969.601,976.375,They were Intermingled with a lot of historic artifacts related to Seattle city light activity and we separated the collection so we are just transferring the artifacts that should belong to the upper Skagit tribe.,16,,
125,0.97,976.375,990.322,"We maintain access at an approved duration facility that is run by the National Park service and the ordinance anticipates keeping the artifacts, as long as the new owner desires that.",16,,
126,0.97,990.322,999.098,In conversations with the upper Skagit tribe it is the best option because it is close to them.,16,,
127,0.97,999.098,1009.742,The other option would be a museum which would be convenient for people to visit and the artifacts would continue to be accessible to the other tribes in the area.,16,,
128,0.97,1009.742,1011.677,We pay the cost for key ration of the artifacts and it is a minimal cost.,16,,
129,0.97,1011.677,1034.867,"We pay for about eight or 10 weeks of labor per year which translates into about $19,000 or $25,000 and it is for the cure ration of all artifacts, not just these . The National Park Service has agreed to continue Curating these artifacts under the existing arrangement with them . It will not be any additional cost to the city.",16,,
130,0.97,1034.867,1049.882,"In 2016, when we hired our Archaeologist for the first time, widely respected among the tribes in the Skagit Valley, that is the first time the upper Skagit tribe request to the artifacts be transferred to them.",16,,
131,0.97,1049.882,1060.092,I worked at City light for three years and one of the first things the upper Skagit tribe told me is they want their artifacts back as one of the priorities for the current Relicensing process.,16,,
132,0.97,1060.092,1070.736,They have gone out of their way to demonstrate the cultural and spiritual significance of the entire area where the project is.,16,,
133,0.97,1070.736,1079.578,"Along with those requests and the other work, that is what has led us to where we are today.",16,,
134,0.97,1079.578,1085.751,"We have coordinated with the other two tribes, speaking with them specifically.",16,,
135,0.97,1085.751,1102.134,The Sauk-Suiattle tribe seem the most interested.,16,,
136,0.97,1102.134,1106.772,I reached out to upper Skagit and they indicated a preference of talking directly to the tribe as it should be done and the conversation did happen and I heard from both parties.,16,,
137,0.97,1106.772,1121.587,And I have not heard any requests since that time from the Sauk-Suiattle tribe.,16,,
138,0.97,1121.587,1131.363,Just to emphasize they will continue to be open as long as the National Park duration facility is open to visit.,16,,

170,0.97,1263.362,1265.664,Will the Presenters please introduce yourselves.,23,,
171,0.97,1265.664,1273.105,Council central staff.,24,,
172,0.97,1273.105,1282.447,This is Philip from the office of economic development.,25,,
173,0.97,1282.447,1285.817,Good morning.,26,,
174,0.97,1285.817,1286.151,Tom Norwalk.,26,,
175,0.97,1286.151,1289.221,Visit Seattle and Allie,26,,
176,0.97,1289.221,1301.833,I am here.,27,,
177,0.97,1301.833,1307.406,Sorry.,27,,
178,0.97,1307.406,1309.641,Trey Lamont.,27,,
179,0.97,1309.641,1315.681,Have I missed anyone?,28,,
180,0.97,1315.681,1322.287,Okay.,28,,
181,0.97,1322.287,1327.125,Thank you very much chair Nelson.,29,,
182,0.97,1327.125,1333.465,My name is Philip and I work for Oed.,29,,
183,0.97,1333.465,1348.647,I will do a short presentation about the Stia and I will send it over to Tom and Allie for a separate presentation.,29,,
184,0.97,1348.647,1356.788,My presentation will be about five minutes and then Tom and Allie will go over there slides and we will leave plenty of time for questions.,29,,
185,0.97,1356.788,1369.901,"As the Bia program manager, currently we have 11 in the city of Seattle and currently they are generating about $26 million in enhanced programs and services in our city.",29,,
186,0.97,1369.901,1372.137,The benefit of the districts or industries to create a Bia is predictability and sustainable funding.,29,,
187,0.97,1372.137,1381.279,"And during the pandemic and prior they served is that apartments between city departments, city leadership and our community Stakeholders.",29,,
188,0.97,1381.279,1384.916,Here is a little bit of a geographic overview of some of the bias.,29,,
189,0.97,1384.916,1389.821,W have active conversations in other neighborhoods as well.,29,,
190,0.97,1389.821,1400.432,"In terms of funding for a business improvement area, it is up to the particular district when they create the organization on what they would like to focus those assessments and revenues for.",29,,
191,0.97,1400.432,1406.738,Here are a few examples of some of the activities and programs that a number of our bias are focusing on.,29,,
192,0.97,1406.738,1415.714,In the case of Stia it is about promoting the region and local tourism and international tourism.,29,,
193,0.97,1415.714,1419.651,Here is a little bit of a Screenshot of some activities in the city.,29,,
194,0.97,1419.651,1422.788,Spectrum of programs and services they offer runs the gamut.,29,,
195,0.97,1422.788,1437.969,"In terms of the service area, the Stia focus primarily on the downtown hotels, however their mission and vision is primarily to focus on marketing the entire region as a whole.",29,,
196,0.97,1437.969,1445.944,Here is a geographic look at the Differen hotels that encompasses Stia.,29,,
197,0.97,1445.944,1450.682,Stia was established by city council in 2011.,29,,
198,0.97,1450.682,1463.862,"Through that ordinance, visit Seattle serves as the program manager to Seattle tourism improvement area funds . They in turn report to a advisory board comprised of hotel operators and managers in this service area.",29,,
199,0.97,1463.862,1479.511,"Hotel guests are assessed to dollars per occupant night, via the ordinance and assessments are spelled out for International travel and Off- season travel.",29,,
200,0.97,1479.511,1488.153,Unlike many other bias in the city Stia does not have a consumer price index.,29,,
201,0.97,1488.153,1492.858,Most of the bias have a growth factor to keep low cost and to expand new services as their district grows.,29,,
202,0.97,1492.858,1501.466,In the case of Stia they do not have a growth factor when the original ordinance was created.,29,,
203,0.97,1501.466,1518.55,In 2018 or 2019 the leadership of visit Seattle and Stia approached the city on a potential rate change given that reality of the fact that there was no growth factor built into the ordinance and competing markets was essentially continuing to grow their revenues in other markets.,29,,
204,0.97,1518.55,1534.099,State allows for rate change once per year and allowed by ordinance after a hearing before the legislative authority.,29,,
205,0.97,1534.099,1535.1,Stia held an annual meeting in October 2021.,29,,
206,0.97,1535.1,1538.303,And the Ratepayers approved the resolution internally to support this amendment change.,29,,
207,0.97,1538.303,1555.787,"While an amendment process do not require petitions as with a formation or creation of a new Bia, visit Seattle was able to secure 94% with no known opposition.",29,,
208,0.97,1555.787,1561.793,"In terms of forecasting what would occur after the amendment if it was to be passed, this is all estimates based on a number of factors.",29,,
209,0.97,1561.793,1565.497,But there is some unknowns.,29,,
210,0.97,1565.497,1576.508,"If it were to increase the rate on a conservative occupancy estimate, this is what the growth factor could look like in the coming years.",29,,
211,0.97,1576.508,1583.848,That is something to know as we get into this recovery period for the region and this particular industry.,29,,
212,0.97,1583.848,1585.951,Tom and Allie will go more into details about programs and services related to this amendment.,29,,
213,0.97,1585.951,1596.094,I will send it over to them at this time.,29,,
214,0.97,1596.094,1609.074,"Madam chair, can I ask a question quest? I was meant to do that before we got to central staff because they will go into Overdrive.",30,,
215,0.97,1609.074,1621.786,I always appreciate your power points in the information you provide regarding the bias and now Seattle tourism improvement area.,30,,
216,0.97,1621.786,1625.357,You got a little ahead of me on the growth factor when you said there was no growth factor.,30,,
217,0.97,1625.357,1627.692,Can you repeat that again?,30,,
218,0.97,1627.692,1628.827,There is something I want to,30,,
219,0.97,1628.827,1653.685,"Each of the bias that are particularly tied to property owners or business owners, there is a 3% or less growth factor for each year and that is in terms of services increasing cost and inflation and a way for the Bia organizations to keep up with cost.",31,,
220,0.97,1653.685,1656.287,Other districts have different formulas to account for new development within the District as well.,31,,
221,0.97,1656.287,1667.132,In the case of Stia the two dollars of occupancy per night has stayed consistent since 2011.,31,,
222,0.97,1667.132,1669.567,You know this and I want to show this again because we are pushing hard.,32,,
223,0.97,1669.567,1676.408,I think we have one Bia north of the ship Canal.,32,,
224,0.97,1676.408,1682.28,Or 11.,32,,
225,0.97,1682.28,1682.714,That is correct.,33,,
226,0.97,1682.714,1683.381,I have a problem with that.,34,,
227,0.97,1683.381,1696.394,We have had tremendous growth in district 5 with light rail and Simon properties and others and two hotels have come Online and we are anticipating two more on the Northgate Footprint and the Bia.,34,,
228,0.97,1696.394,1711.543,Would we be working with your office and Madam chair committee to talk about how the Stia would fit into the strict five and growth even if we do n't,34,,
229,0.97,1711.543,1735.9,"While the assessment is being drawn from the hotel, 65 or so common the revenues being leveraged by visit Seattle is leveraged for the entire city region.",35,,
230,0.97,1735.9,1752.083,"For visit Seattle to market as Úa destination for Seattle, there is marketing and other program support for all of the Seattle business districts, including district 5. I will turn it over to Tom and Allie if you want to add anything else.",35,,
231,0.97,1752.083,1752.684,I think people come to,36,,
232,0.97,1752.684,1763.962,Did visit Seattle want to comment?,37,,
233,0.97,1763.962,1770.468,I would echo what Philip said.,38,,
234,0.97,1770.468,1774.105,We are promoting the entire region and we know Visitation takes place throughout the city in every district.,38,,
235,0.97,1774.105,1777.976,And I agree with Council President Warez.,38,,
236,0.97,1777.976,1786.117,It is an entire city we sell.,38,,
237,0.97,1786.117,1787.452,We will try to get into that a little bit in our presentation.,38,,
238,0.97,1787.452,1796.561,"I would like to note that I am happy to be a champion for the formation of another Bia, North of the ship Canal.",39,,
239,0.97,1796.561,1800.365,Tom and Allie.,40,,
240,0.97,1800.365,1810.275,"We just want you to know how honored and proud we are to sell the city, which we do around the world.",40,,
241,0.97,1810.275,1817.849,And we think we have one of the greatest regions in the nation and we are excited to continue this work as things improve.,40,,
242,0.97,1817.849,1828.026,"And if you can advance the next slide, thank you for doing that.",40,,
243,0.97,1828.026,1857.121,"I will not Belabor the point of where we have been over the last couple years and I think we have said often that the travel and tourism industry has been disproportionately hit with this pandemic in every area from employment to job losses, to the reduction in revenues coming in and flowing through, which are created by lodging tax that help find so many other things in addition to operations of restaurants and et cetera.",40,,
244,0.97,1857.121,1860.291,You will hear from Trey momentarily about his thoughts on that.,40,,
245,0.97,1860.291,1875.006,These numbers go back and we will provide more detail if you would like but this is looking at 2020. we are looking at meetings and cancellations and meetings and event cancellations.,40,,
246,0.97,1875.006,1880.778,Cruces is that were canceled or modified and we are getting ready now for what could be a robust season this summer.,40,,
247,0.97,1880.778,1884.582,One of the measurements is we use the hotel occupancy.,40,,
248,0.97,1884.582,1894.392,"Last week, for example, downtown Seattle and the broader Seattle area ran about a 46% occupancy of hotel rooms.",40,,
249,0.97,1894.392,1903.301,"If you look compared to a year ago, that was 21% . If you look back to where we were Pre- pandemic the numbers for the same week and time were closer to 78%.",40,,
250,0.97,1903.301,1906.738,We have a long way to go.,40,,
251,0.97,1906.738,1928.359,And we really do believe that increased funding with the mechanism in place it is one of the fastest and surest ways to ensure recovery for this region and primarily in employment and more Visitation.,40,,
252,0.97,1928.359,1930.728,We are getting to the point where every city and every destination around the country is doing the same thing.,40,,
253,0.97,1930.728,1941.039,For us to be competitive we feel we need to take this moment and increase this rate.,40,,
254,0.97,1941.039,1954.686,"We know that tourism is competitive and we know that leisure travel specifically, which the Tia is by ordinance, empowered to go out and create.",40,,
255,0.97,1954.686,1957.355,"It is competitive and in many cases, leisure travel is Researched and people take time to look at where they want to go.",40,,
256,0.97,1957.355,1969.801,Especially arts and cultural travelers that come to this area that take time to research . We know leisure travel can be spontaneous and impulsive.,40,,
257,0.97,1969.801,1979.644,In either scenario we need to be top of mind and do that in a strong way.,40,,
258,0.97,1979.644,1989.954,"Looking at competitive cities that we compete against, starting with Nashville on the left down through Vancouver, these are the total marketing and organizational budgets of like organizations to visit Seattle.",40,,
259,0.97,1989.954,2008.773,"They are in millions of dollars . with $32 million in Nashville down through $8 million roughly in Vancouver, the two different bars represent the different operating budgets of those organizations.",40,,
260,0.97,2008.773,2014.078,"If you look at Seattle, our $10.4 million in these are the 21, numbers.",40,,
261,0.97,2014.078,2021.486,$5.7 million of our budget came from a small piece of the convention center lodging tax in the city.,40,,
262,0.97,2021.486,2029.36,And the 4.7 was the amount generated by our tourism improvement area.,40,,
263,0.97,2029.36,2049.514,"You can see even combined, those sources of funding, where we are currently and project to go which is not adequate for us to be doing the job we think, to get back to close to Pre- pandemic levels.",40,,
264,0.97,2049.514,2051.849,We know the recovery job will be long and not all parts of travel and tourism will come back at the same time.,40,,
265,0.97,2051.849,2061.159,"But leisure, tourism, what we have been living on for the last two years in a small way, really is what we have to promote and go forward with.",40,,
266,0.97,2061.159,2069.233,And that is specifically what the Tia is set up to do.,40,,
267,0.97,2069.233,2084.282,"We asked Trey Lamont, a board member and restaurant tour, Seattle native to speak briefly but I think the point is, tourism generates jobs and revenues in many sectors in addition to lodging, overnight lodging.",40,,
268,0.97,2084.282,2092.79,"And 24% of visitors spent is spent and restaurant, food and privilege, broadly around the city and County.",40,,
269,0.97,2092.79,2106.671,Thank you for having me speak on behalf of the board a visit Seattle.,41,,
270,0.97,2106.671,2138.97,I would like to talk about how not just tourism but with the increase to the Stia amendment and an increase to the right for hotels would improve--and how their marketing has improved.,41,,
271,0.97,2138.97,2172.637,"How it would improve the sales and foot traffic of downtown restaurants as well because me being a restaurant tour and having my own brick and mortar for almost the past five years now, zero dollars on marketing and branding . visit Seattle are the ones that have spent their budget and that is what the budget is for.",41,,
272,0.97,2172.637,2186.35,"And they are the ones I look to to market restaurants like mine a well as the hotel, concierge and hotel industry that surrounds my restaurant.",41,,
273,0.97,2186.35,2195.026,"When I come out of the kitchen and meet customers, most of my customers are not even from Seattle.",41,,
274,0.97,2195.026,2197.328,Before the pandemic.,41,,
275,0.97,2197.328,2204.468,Now it is mostly Seattle residents.,41,,
276,0.97,2204.468,2225.523,"When it is tour season, I will always ask how did you hear about us and where did you come from? and I could have a whole conversation with customers that do not come from Seattle.",41,,
277,0.97,2225.523,2229.894,"I would be so amazed on how they would find out about us and it was through organization such as, visit Seattle.",41,,
278,0.97,2229.894,2238.836,"And if we don't find these organizations, my business would cease to exist.",41,,
279,0.97,2238.836,2250.548,And I think that is very important to increase the rate.,41,,
280,0.97,2252.917,2253.784,That is pretty much all I have to say.,41,,
281,0.97,2253.784,2261.959,Thank you for being here this morning.,42,,
282,0.97,2261.959,2262.293,I apologize.,42,,
283,0.97,2262.293,2269.066,I get excited when we talk about our campaigns and the huge honor we have to celebrate this amazing destination.,42,,
284,0.97,2269.066,2279.71,"From the very beginning the Tia gave us an opportunity, the Stia gave us a first opportunity to promote Seattle as a leisure destination.",42,,
285,0.97,2279.71,2283.814,We found great success in using real people's voices.,42,,
286,0.97,2283.814,2289.12,"Real locals, real visitors to tell the story.",42,,
287,0.97,2289.12,2293.924,In 2015 we moved into Video content and you will see some of the series.,42,,
288,0.97,2293.924,2297.928,We created over 17 different Video series.,42,,
289,0.97,2297.928,2305.936,"People can view this easier and we want to make sure when they look that content, they were thinking about Seattle.",42,,
290,0.97,2305.936,2313.444,This is not traditional travel content.,42,,
291,0.97,2313.444,2314.211,These are stories about Seattle.,42,,
292,0.97,2314.211,2325.823,We use voices from all kinds of people . that tells about why this is such a special place.,42,,
293,0.97,2325.823,2338.269,And we have videos from 30 seconds up to 30 minutes.,42,,
294,0.97,2341.105,2341.972,One has been viewed over 7 million times.,42,,
295,0.97,2341.972,2345.576,"During the pandemic when we cannot promote a destination we engaged our own channels with this content saying, travel might be discouraged right now but dreaming is not.",42,,
296,0.97,2345.576,2347.144,And allow them to keep Seattle top of mind.,42,,
297,0.97,2347.144,2352.083,Next slide.,42,,
298,0.97,2352.083,2359.824,"One of our series, Family-Style talked about immigrant chefs in their restaurants and family recipes that they brought to Seattle.",42,,
299,0.97,2359.824,2365.863,They see it as the responsibility to carry on their family recipes and they have chosen Seattle to do it.,42,,
300,0.97,2365.863,2367.665,I could spend all day talking about this one.,42,,
301,0.97,2367.665,2381.645,But this series has been viewed 4.4 million times.,42,,
302,0.97,2383.047,2387.918,And they get to tell that story.,42,,
303,0.97,2387.918,2390.788,I'm going so fast.,42,,
304,0.97,2390.788,2395.626,I love the stuff so much.,42,,
305,0.97,2395.626,2408.372,We launch this in the middle of the pandemic and we created a nimble platform that we could speak to locals and encourage them to support local businesses to stay downtown . to explore the neighborhoods.,42,,
306,0.97,2408.372,2410.775,But we created it in a way in which we can turn that up and speak to visitors as well.,42,,
307,0.97,2410.775,2420.885,We wanted people to see that Seattle maintains this vibrancy and you can maintain . We added Video content.,42,,
308,0.97,2420.885,2448.179,We have our friends . This is a campaign we want to continue.,42,,
309,0.97,2448.179,2450.548,Seattle museum month we just finished our eighth annual and that happens the month of February.,42,,
310,0.97,2450.548,2463.561,If you stay downtown you receive a voucher for 50% off.,42,,
311,0.97,2467.264,2486.483,This gives us an opportunity to add value to Travelers during February when we know it is a quiet month but also to celebrate the incredible arts and culture scene we have and how everyone plays together at the same time.,42,,
312,0.97,2486.483,2498.796,"Not only do we have an internal PR team that is pitching and developing relationships with media, we created Seattle good News.Com and it is a ration of the wonderful things that happen here.",42,,
313,0.97,2498.796,2510.007,We want to celebrate that Seattle is special on all these levels.,42,,
314,0.97,2510.007,2512.676,Thank you.,43,,
315,0.97,2512.676,2538.369,"The last two slides, we are asking for the Council to increase the assessment . When we look at what the numbers could mean to us, if the assessment were to go forward midyear this year that would increase our total marketing budget and potential up to about $10 million and certainly in future years it helps us and as we start to experience recovery.",43,,
316,0.97,2538.369,2548.679,"It does not put us at the top of that competitive list . It puts us more toward the top but not there and we realize we need to take steps to bring our business back, in a very equitable way.",43,,
317,0.97,2548.679,2552.583,Around the region where it is needed the most.,43,,
318,0.97,2552.583,2582.98,"In the last slide, there is a number of things we would do with additional funding . We do more of what we know works and we would spend more time in domestic markets that make sense, where the timing is right and and that is Canada to the North or more international growth comment this global city will see large international growth in future years of overseas visitors.",43,,

376,0.97,3003.567,3003.934,Sounds good.,57,,
377,0.97,3003.934,3013.51,One of the issues that keeps getting kicked around and I know different administrations have different visions.,57,,

382,0.97,3042.906,3051.415,It is clearly an important issue.,58,,
383,0.97,3051.415,3073.503,Both for the film and music industry but as far as I understand the other creative industries in the arts and culture organizations and jobs represented by those organizations . I am trying to listen and learn from those who are currently in the office of film and music and external Stakeholders to learn the ends and outs of why it has been designated an office versus why it has been folded into a larger conversation.,58,,
384,0.97,3073.503,3077.841,I would love to talk to you about that.,58,,
385,0.97,3077.841,3082.145,It used to be the office of the Mayor.,59,,

387,0.97,3087.451,3106.369,"When administrations changed, it moved from being at the office of the Mayor to an office within the office of Intergovernmental relations and has been a redheaded stepchild and we have lost a lot of amazing talent to the county.",59,,

428,0.97,3339.002,3350.246,This slide illustrates there is policy alignment for Seattle city light that is helping us push Decarbonization as quickly as possible.,66,,
429,0.97,3350.246,3364.761,This slide focuses on the most driving aspects terms of city and state policy objectives . at the city level the climate action plan is the primary guiding document.,66,,
430,0.97,3364.761,3369.399,That's a net zero by 2050 objective.,66,,
431,0.97,3369.399,3398.294,Next was the green new deal which was setting a more aggressive target . specifically this body of work that we will talk about today actually ties back to a Council statement of legislative intent from 2019 which directed the utility to report on the transition to report on all transportation and buildings in Seattle in response to the green new deal resolution.,66,,
432,0.97,3398.294,3399.129,That is where the's got its start.,66,,
433,0.97,3399.129,3405.702,"At the state level we have the Washington state energy strategy, Northwest power conservation to Decolonize.",66,,
434,0.97,3405.702,3422.485,A clean energy transformation acts there is great alignment regionally as we think about how we plan for this energy future.,66,,
435,0.97,3422.485,3425.288,Low carbon fuel standard was passed earlier this year fire state Legislature.,66,,
436,0.97,3425.288,3440.57,"For city light, carbon neutral electricity has been focusing on Electrification of end use.",66,,
437,0.97,3440.57,3444.073,"I work around this is within the portion of our strategic plan that is called, create our energy future.",66,,
438,0.97,3444.073,3471.501,"Which is to Electrify transportation and buildings, modernize the grid to keep it reliable and resilient . This work response to a key question we get asked when we talk about Decarbonization in the future of our energy system.",66,,
439,0.97,3471.501,3477.24,Can the grid handle Electrification of building and transportation and you can see from the pie chart those are the big tranches of emissions in our area.,66,,
440,0.97,3477.24,3493.323,This study is a Foundational tool that allows us to plan for our electrified future.,66,,
441,0.97,3495.158,3531.294,"This work is responsive to the Council statement of legislative intent and as we did this work we have engaged and coordinated information sharing with a broad coalition of Stakeholders across utility, across the city and beyond in the way we see this, it will impact all aspects for the utility and the communities we serve .

447,0.97,3573.97,3584.48,That means bringing benefits.,67,,
448,0.97,3593.823,3612.775,We are planning and building for now . We are Reimagining the grid making investments that allow flexibility . It is key.,67,,
449,0.97,3614.61,3623.453,And key to making a grid that is reliable and resilient.,67,,
450,0.97,3623.453,3632.762,This requires us to leverage technology . technology is only a piece of the puzzle.,67,,
451,0.97,3632.762,3657.487,"Partnerships, we have to go beyond and participate with customers so we know how to plan to meet the load growth and we must continue to learn every day.",67,,

465,0.97,3873.869,3876.105,Building Electrification.,67,,
466,0.97,3876.105,3884.847,We are building a strategy.,67,,
467,0.97,3884.847,3896.826,As the grid has an important role to play.,67,,
468,0.97,3907.203,3926.289,We are getting feedback . utility next is something I will highlight.,67,,
469,0.97,3926.289,3930.059,This kicked off during the pandemic.,67,,
470,0.97,3930.059,3942.605,Anticipating investments would be on the way.,67,,
471,0.97,3942.605,3946.142,We have received more than $3 million in grant funding.,67,,
472,0.97,3946.142,3955.551,We are prepared for the spending that has been approved.,67,,
473,0.97,3955.551,3988.25,This is an Enabler . We want to highway that this is underway.,67,,

475,0.97,4011.04,4017.146,We found three key points.,68,,
476,0.97,4017.146,4019.915,Electrification provides a path to meet the city's goals.,68,,
477,0.97,4019.915,4030.96,"The scenarios Reevaluated, looked at scenarios that were based on goals and the green new deal.",68,,
478,0.97,4030.96,4038.534,Under these scenarios Electrification supported those goals.,68,,
479,0.97,4038.534,4058.154,The second in sight is Electrification will [Indiscernible-Poor Audio] the impact or very based on its location.,68,,
480,0.97,4058.154,4094.59,This is the in sight that seems obvious on its face . [Indiscernible--low volume] the third in sight is the analysis is the beginning of a larger undertaking.,68,,
481,0.97,4094.59,4110.105,I will discuss this later but we need to do additional analysis.,68,,
482,0.97,4110.673,4115.678,Next slide.,68,,
483,0.97,4115.678,4142.738,"The scope of the study, this is a collaborative effort . as well as involvement from--we wanted to take a wide ranging look to incorporate policies.",68,,
484,0.97,4149.745,4177.907,We look at [Indiscernible-Poor Audio] what are the impacts? and we have to look at the grid in our service territory that is serving customers.,68,,
485,0.97,4177.907,4185.447,What is the available capacity?,68,,
486,0.97,4185.447,4191.72,To we have room to provide that service?,68,,
487,0.97,4191.72,4199.895,We can understand what the impacts might be and how we think about the grid moving forward.,68,,
488,0.97,4199.895,4218.18,"There is some additional analysis in the study that looks at potential strategies, but we will not get into that today.",68,,
489,0.97,4218.18,4229.391,Equally important is what is out of scope.,68,,
490,0.97,4229.391,4231.727,The first thing is conservation and energy efficiency.,68,,
491,0.97,4231.727,4245.741,This seems odd because they are crucial pieces.,68,,
492,0.97,4245.741,4290.419,"It was important to not include it in the study . by holding that out, it allows us to do the analysis in house and understand what Electrification might be if we did not Institute new policies and understanding what the potential implication is without the conservation . Similarly, we did not assess demand response.",68,,
493,0.97,4290.419,4297.626,We don't look at transmission.,68,,
494,0.97,4297.626,4308.137,The generation that it takes.,68,,
495,0.97,4310.839,4314.009,And we don't look at the cost or rate impact.,68,,
496,0.97,4314.076,4318.714,Here is somethin being at the Department of Commerce.,68,,
497,0.97,4318.714,4336.298,That we hope to adopt . I will hand the server to Jamie and she will walk us to the results.,68,,
498,0.97,4336.298,4343.906,I am speaking from my home office.,69,,
499,0.97,4343.906,4353.782,Electric power research Institute is a nonprofit.,69,,
500,0.97,4353.782,4359.555,Hoping to support utilities.,69,,
501,0.97,4359.555,4367.596,We are getting short on time.,69,,
502,0.97,4367.596,4368.597,I'm excited to talk about this presentation.,69,,
503,0.97,4368.597,4371.4,I will jump back and forth between where when and how much.,69,,
504,0.97,4371.4,4374.236,"Where power electricity is needed, when and how much.",69,,
505,0.97,4374.236,4383.879,I will keep those in mind as we go through as I explained the different findings we found.,69,,
506,0.97,4383.879,4414.91,"It has been mentioned that we looked into three different scenarios and they are outlined here . The moderate market advancement was more of a business as usual where we looked at adoption in the area, where we see adoption going and adoption of the new technologies . and scenario 2 and 3 are based on goals that the city of Seattle and Seattle city light had.",70,,
507,0.97,4414.91,4415.444,They are outlined here.,70,,
508,0.97,4415.444,4436.198,"Just to highlight for the third scenario, we are looking at 100% of all passenger vehicles, on medium and heavy-duty vehicles being Electric . from the buildings and industrial side in the third scenario it is full adoption by 2030.",70,,
509,0.97,4436.198,4436.999,This lets us Electrify everything.,70,,
510,0.97,4436.999,4447.576,"You can see in the second scenario, there are still some large targets that are there.",70,,
511,0.97,4447.576,4453.849,Long haul and inner-city bus on the low end but that is because the technology is not here yet.,70,,
512,0.97,4453.849,4457.853,That will be an emerging group that will come quickly as well.,70,,
513,0.97,4457.853,4461.089,Next slide.,70,,
514,0.97,4461.089,4468.564,This is talking about how much.,70,,
515,0.97,4468.564,4485.414,2020 to 2042 and we are looking at totaled Terawatt hours . how much energy would it take to meet the goals.,70,,
516,0.97,4485.414,4486.782,"And the Red is the scenario, for scenario, business as usual.",70,,
517,0.97,4486.782,4488.45,The blue is more advanced adoption and the green is 100% Electrification.,70,,
518,0.97,4488.45,4502.865,"You might ask why we did not extend the green all the way to 2020. in the electric transportation realm, if we were to force everyone to adopt an electric vehicle tomorrow we still would not meet the goal.",70,,
519,0.97,4502.865,4506.435,Which is start in 2030 with 100% Rectification.,70,,
520,0.97,4506.435,4509.671,That does not mean it is not important.,70,,
521,0.97,4509.671,4519.314,That is the upper Goalpost that shows what would it take and planning for that ultimate scenario is what is important.,70,,
522,0.97,4519.314,4521.35,Where is the grid at and what do we need if this is the final end goal?,70,,
523,0.97,4521.35,4525.387,Next slide.,70,,
524,0.97,4525.387,4545.974,"If we take that scenario 2 and we color underneath by the different Technologies that attribute to the energy needed, we see the buildings and commercial and industrial sector accounting for approximately 80% of the total energy needed overtime.",70,,
525,0.97,4545.974,4554.85,"There is growth within these overtime but as the new technologies coming in, the Technologies are very efficient.",70,,
526,0.97,4554.85,4561.89,As those Technologies are getting adopted we are seeing a huge growth overtime.,70,,
527,0.97,4561.89,4563.659,But because the technology is better we see slower growth.,70,,
528,0.97,4563.659,4566.828,The bigger piece is the electric vehicles.,70,,
529,0.97,4566.828,4569.264,The largest change.,70,,
530,0.97,4569.264,4575.804,"Going from very little, although Seattle has a pretty high adoption rate.",70,,
531,0.97,4575.804,4585.647,It is pretty impressive to see the percentage of vehicle sales . I think we are up 10%.,70,,
532,0.97,4585.647,4589.918,One out of every 10 vehicles in Seattle currently purchased our Electric.,70,,
533,0.97,4589.918,4594.089,We see the rapidly going overtime.,70,,
534,0.97,4594.089,4595.591,Next slide.,70,,
535,0.97,4595.591,4596.525,This is the full Electrification scenario.,70,,
536,0.97,4596.525,4606.969,We are not doing it starting at 2020 we are starting at 2030.,70,,
537,0.97,4606.969,4610.005,You see the ratio between the different needs play out over time.,70,,
538,0.97,4610.005,4616.645,With transportation taking about 23% of the total energy needed as we move forward.,70,,
539,0.97,4616.645,4618.847,This is what we are seeing on a national level if we were to Electrify everything.,70,,
540,0.97,4618.847,4625.921,Nationally it is about 25% would be contributing to electric transportation.,70,,
541,0.97,4625.921,4626.855,Next slide.,70,,
542,0.97,4626.855,4629.758,Now we are talking when.,70,,
543,0.97,4629.758,4633.161,This is a low curve over a whole year.,70,,
544,0.97,4633.161,4647.075,In the utility industry . on the X-Axis you see the entire year and on the Y-Axis we are talking Megawatts.,70,,
545,0.97,4647.075,4651.046,The amount of power needed.,70,,
546,0.97,4651.046,4659.388,What this is showing is when the power is needed overtime.,70,,
547,0.97,4659.388,4663.392,Seattle is a winter peeking utility and as we adopt more and more Electri technology you would expect the power needed overtime would grow.,70,,
548,0.97,4663.392,4667.763,"We see lots of spikes because at different times of day, folks would use electricity at different points.",70,,
549,0.97,4667.763,4676.605,"If you were to count all the larger spikes, it is probably 52.",70,,
550,0.97,4676.605,4681.209,We see with adopted electric Technologies this scale overtime is increasing.,70,,
551,0.97,4681.209,4689.584,"We are looking in the summer, sorry in the winter of 4.4 Gigawatts and in the summer at about two Gigawatts.",70,,
552,0.97,4689.584,4691.72,Next slide.,70,,
553,0.97,4691.72,4695.724,This is the same plot showing when.,70,,
554,0.97,4695.724,4707.436,For reference we have the 2020 winter and 2020 summer values.,70,,
555,0.97,4707.436,4709.871,You can see the power needed at both of those times is increasing when we look at the full Electrification scenario.,70,,
556,0.97,4709.871,4718.814,The power needed is about 30% due to transportation and the rest is used in buildings.,70,,
557,0.97,4718.814,4722.317,Similar to the energy needs that we projected yearly overtime.,70,,
558,0.97,4722.317,4723.118,Next slide.,70,,
559,0.97,4723.118,4729.791,All of this does not make sense unless we put it into context of what the grid can handle.,70,,
560,0.97,4729.791,4737.365,I will talk in a couple slides about what are the available capacity and how we need to be thinking about this as we move forward.,70,,
561,0.97,4737.365,4742.904,Next slide.,70,,
562,0.97,4742.904,4762.023,"The grid analysis that we did, we did a detailed systemwide analysis looking at how much capacity was available . We did this in a number of ways . We considered voltage and thermal issues as well as time specifics . You can imagine there may be times when there is more available capacity than others.",70,,
563,0.97,4762.023,4768.73,There is lots of ways to Drag- And-Drop this but we took a detailed analysis of what the grid was able to handle.,70,,
564,0.97,4768.73,4775.637,Next slide.,70,,
565,0.97,4775.637,4777.672,Before I get into a couple of my heat maps I wanted to draw attention to how we calculated.,70,,
566,0.97,4777.672,4780.242,This is another 8760.,70,,
567,0.97,4780.242,4819.981,"And we have capacity on the Y- axis . If you look at the top lot, this is showing the capacity . We are removing the energy that folks are using and what is available to be used for other uses? highlighted is the worst possible day for that . If you carry that down you see it drops down to slightly below two Megawatts . When we generate these graphs showing available capacity we are often looking at what is the day that constrains us the most or the hour that constrains us the most?",70,,
568,0.97,4819.981,4828.19,"What I want to highlight is there one day, a lot of available capacity at other times.",70,,
569,0.97,4828.19,4841.336,"In taking about moving forward and a new grid, thinking about how we can be flexible with our demands as we move forward.",70,,
570,0.97,4841.336,4847.842,"Could we use energy on different days or different times, that's what we need to take about.",70,,
571,0.97,4847.842,4858.32,As you think of this in looking at different scenarios in the times when the grid might be most constrained when we think about limits moving forward.,70,,
572,0.97,4858.32,4860.555,Next slide.,70,,
573,0.97,4860.555,4865.694,Here heat maps showing what we found on the grid.,70,,
574,0.97,4865.694,4868.396,Keep the previous slide in mind as we look at this.,70,,
575,0.97,4868.396,4884.579,"On the left side, the more red one . This is capacity during peak load hour.",70,,
576,0.97,4884.579,4886.181,When the feeder is loaded the most and has the least amount of capacity.,70,,
577,0.97,4886.181,4890.919,This graph is showing the available capacity at the worst hour over the entire year.,70,,
578,0.97,4890.919,4893.755,We were thinking of a way of explaining this.,70,,
579,0.97,4893.755,4907.102,"If you were to draft a sports team based on the players worst hour of playing in their entire year of playing and put them all together, this is what it would look like.",70,,
580,0.97,4907.102,4911.106,This is the worst case scenario.,70,,
581,0.97,4911.106,4917.078,It provides an in sight of what we might be dealing with in the worst case scenario.,70,,
582,0.97,4917.078,4918.813,On the right side we are looking at the capacity during the minimum load hour.,70,,
583,0.97,4918.813,4938.767,This is the best case scenario over the year of when there might be a lot of capacity and the grid is not getting used very much or there is not a lot of demand on the grid . There is a lot of variability . and there is a lot of available capacity.,70,,
584,0.97,4938.767,4941.97,These are similar ones but looking at energy.,70,,
585,0.97,4941.97,4949.144,Rather than looking at power needed at a specific time this is energy available overall time.,70,,
586,0.97,4949.144,4964.793,"If you were able to Soak up all the available energy whether you stored in batteries to use when you needed or shift your behavior to use it when it is available, this is how you might be able to draw from the grid.",70,,
587,0.97,4964.793,4966.127,Annual energy capacity.,70,,
588,0.97,4966.127,4971.099,This is under the line I should previous.,70,,
589,0.97,4971.099,4976.137,How many megawatt hours are available? and the minimum daily energy capacity.,70,,
590,0.97,4976.137,4986.414,Looking at the worst day and the amount of energy available on the day.,70,,
591,0.97,4986.414,4995.623,"If you modeled the amount of energy and you want to the same amount of energy every day, you would model on the minimum day.",70,,
592,0.97,4995.623,4996.725,Take-Home is there is a lot of available capacity.,70,,
593,0.97,4996.725,4998.026,It depends on space and time.,70,,
594,0.97,4998.026,5006.701,But thinking cleverly as we move forward is there is a lot of flexibility.,70,,
595,0.97,5006.701,5022.45,"One thing I would add is on the prior slide, it mentions the capacity as we measure is based on limits we use for planning.",71,,
596,0.97,5022.45,5040.235,It is either 50% of physical capacity or--one thing we are looking at is whether the numbers make sense going forward.,71,,
597,0.97,5040.235,5055.45,To put the sewing context here is another 8760.,72,,
598,0.97,5055.45,5060.388,This shows the current demand on the grid . The Orange is what folks are using.,72,,
599,0.97,5060.388,5061.956,And the blue is the available capacity.,72,,
600,0.97,5061.956,5068.63,You can see that there is a lot of available capacity.,72,,
601,0.97,5068.63,5074.636,The drop in the summer is due to constraints and planning limits on the grid that Stephanie mentioned.,72,,
602,0.97,5074.636,5087.315,"When we think about the scenarios that I marked out in the beginning, scenario 2 looks at a power demand of 2.1 Gigawatts and that fits nicely under this curve.",72,,
603,0.97,5087.315,5088.783,You have different area constraints.,72,,
604,0.97,5088.783,5105.633,"But the winter is quite a bit higher and if we go to scenario tree, we see summer at the limit but the winter would have more demand . thinking about full energy available when we talk about when it is available.",72,,
605,0.97,5105.633,5117.445,To give out flexibility . and I would say all of the load shapes I showed don't have any Smarts built into them.,72,,
606,0.97,5117.445,5129.224,"With all the scenarios we are showing the worst day or the worst hour . for example with the electric transportation, we assumed people come home and plug in at home.",72,,
607,0.97,5129.224,5137.732,That is a natural habit . But there are many things you can do to shift that from midnight until 5:00 A.M.,72,,
608,0.97,5137.732,5141.636,Charging.,72,,
609,0.97,5141.636,5144.906,Whether it is a different rate or program your smart charger to do something.,72,,
610,0.97,5144.906,5148.877,There are tons of ways to shift that.,72,,
611,0.97,5148.877,5150.145,Lots of flexibility.,72,,
612,0.97,5150.145,5153.715,Lots of available capacity.,72,,
613,0.97,5153.715,5155.65,I will stop.,72,,
614,0.97,5155.65,5158.653,"Back to you, Stephanie.",72,,
615,0.97,5158.653,5172.667,"Based on the results, we were able to draw some conclusions.",73,,
616,0.97,5172.667,5223.585,"Under the buildings and industry side of things, we know buildings and industry will account for most of the increase in load and that would be due to--I discussed at the beginning--without energy efficiency . flexibility and be able to shift to other hours will be important . think about in terms of the grid being built to smooth out the peaks and have an even distribution, will allow us to most efficiently use our assets.",73,,
617,0.97,5223.585,5231.526,Next slide.,73,,
618,0.97,5231.526,5235.296,Under electric transportation.,73,,
619,0.97,5235.296,5240.335,Passenger vehicles will be the primary user in terms of total energy.,73,,
620,0.97,5240.335,5241.703,You can see that in the Graphics on the right.,73,,
621,0.97,5241.703,5255.45,"The blue section is the energy consumption associated with passenger vehicles . It is a large component, mostly because of the sheer number of passenger vehicles.",73,,
622,0.97,5255.45,5271.633,Another transit buses will be a player . It is something King County Metro is working on.,73,,
623,0.97,5273.968,5275.97,These big loads would come on all at once.,73,,
624,0.97,5275.97,5292.22,"Working with partners, we can find ways to come up with efforts.",73,,
625,0.97,5292.22,5314.742,[Indiscernible--low volume] next slide . City light distribution grid has significant capacity available much of the year.,73,,
626,0.97,5314.742,5326.32,But there are times when the capacity will be limited.,73,,
627,0.97,5326.32,5343.104,Útake away right now is flexibility will be key . that will be critical.,73,,
628,0.97,5343.104,5348.743,Understanding capacity limitations will help us consider new approaches.,73,,
629,0.97,5348.743,5361.422,Some of the limitations related to how we plan.,73,,
630,0.97,5362.824,5378.272,We will look at ways we can try to analyze this going forward.,73,,
631,0.97,5379.774,5387.648,Thank you.,74,,
632,0.97,5387.648,5395.957,Just to Recap . Our goal today has been to give the committee an overview of this work.,74,,
633,0.97,5395.957,5398.426,And give you a sense of what comes next.,74,,
634,0.97,5398.426,5409.404,This work as part of--business strategy.,74,,
635,0.97,5409.404,5410.605,It is all around how we build and maintain the system.,74,,
636,0.97,5410.605,5412.807,The grid.,74,,
637,0.97,5412.807,5428.256,"As a smart and resilient and flexible, reliable system that prepares us for increased Electrification including things like energy resources.",74,,
638,0.97,5428.256,5436.464,It requires a lot of long-term thinking.,74,,
639,0.97,5436.464,5445.807,"And deep partnerships, Holistic planning processes and tools.",74,,
640,0.97,5445.807,5465.026,You also heard it is important for us to stay grounded in the equity impacts of this transition and making sure that we are not only avoiding inequities but we are looking for opportunities to reverse historical inequities in the way the system is built and operated.,74,,
641,0.97,5465.026,5502.663,"Ownerships with customers and other regional leaders, taking advantage of relationships with technical experts . It is exciting and crucial work because it starts to build us a path . We are really committed to making sure the grid infrastructure is a platform that allows the electrified future.",74,,
