22,0.97,60.26,62.729,Very happy to join you all here today.,17,,
23,0.97,62.729,64.23,There are no minutes for approval today.,17,,
24,0.97,64.23,69.769,Going to start off with a short President's report.,17,,
25,0.97,69.769,77.41,Items on today's agenda include a report from our team at the office of Intergovernmental relations.,17,,
26,0.97,77.41,82.048,"A preview of city council actions, and an executive session.",17,,
27,0.97,82.048,102.368,"I want to start today's meeting with recognition of the city Council and entire legislative Department's deep sorrow for the devastating tragedy experienced by our Council president and friend, Lorena Gonzalez and her family.",17,,
28,0.97,102.368,112.545,I cannot comprehend the grief they're feeling losing Mary Lou Williams as mother-in-law and Grandma.,17,,
29,0.97,112.545,128.161,"I want to extend our thanks to the first responders and the Harborview staff for all that they did in this terrible tragedy and our gratitude for all who are offering support to this family that I know so many in our city, and elsewhere care for.",17,,
30,0.97,128.161,141.608,"We ask that everyone join us in holding this family in your thoughts, in your hearts, and for those of you of faith in your prayers.",17,,
31,0.97,141.608,161.461,"One other item of general interest I'd like to mention before turning it over to our OAR team, is in case 2020-0334 otherwise known as the pink umbrella case.",17,,
32,0.97,161.461,182.949,"Since 2007, the municipal cold has required that if [inaudible] decides not to follow the recommendation on the disposition of a complaint.",17,,
33,0.97,182.949,186.686,These are sometimes referred to as reversal letters.,17,,
34,0.97,186.686,200.133,"In the reversal letter, responding to the failure order he wrote a reversal let they're decisions were made at levels of command above that board directly on the named employee's action.",17,,
35,0.97,200.133,204.137,And that the name Employeed was carrying out decisions made at a higher rank.,17,,
36,0.97,204.137,225.191,"In response, I sent three questions to chief Diaz asking why this information was not reflected in the investigation and if this was known that someone else was giving orders, why did not those individuals who knew that others were given orders, inform the investigators of that information?",17,,
37,0.97,225.191,237.236,"I ask what were those decisions being made at a higher rank or command level above, and said that I would have expected that the OPA investigation to reveal this.",17,,
38,0.97,237.236,251.818,"I mentioned that if the chief and other officers have this information, it should have been made public, just as it would have been made public, if officers being reviewed of the OPA investigation had disclosed this information.",17,,
39,0.97,251.818,265.999,"Finally, I asked how these other individuals higher in the chain of command, who's actions in this manner would be held accountable for misuse of force, and unwanted dispersal order.",17,,
40,0.97,265.999,277.076,"The chief replied to these questions, and he's also sent out a statement about his plans moving forward.",17,,
41,0.97,277.076,304.671,"He States there will be accountability for the totality of the incident and for this specific investigation and the resulting discipline process as well as ongoing assessments of what occurred that day, that additional information has surfaced, which was not included in the OPA investigation, and that he anticipates being able to quickly and fully reach a conclusion on who was accountable for the actions on that day.",17,,
42,0.97,304.671,315.581,"I mentioned this, because I know this is in a topic of general interest on Thecouncil and in the general public.",17,,
43,0.97,315.581,340.406,"I think there are still question basis the holding of the named employee for those decisions, but I'm going to hold my sort of judgment on that decision based on what we find out about the direction and the orders being given by individuals that are higher up in the chain of command.",17,,
44,0.97,340.406,348.848,"With that, I think we'll just move on into the next item on the agenda.",17,,
45,0.97,348.848,351.284,A state legislative report.,17,,
46,0.97,351.284,362.962,"The folks joining us today are Lily Wolfen Cadega, and Hanna Smith.",17,,
47,0.97,362.962,376.275,They will provide an overview of the efforts and [inaudible] of the Oir team in advocating for the city's interest in the state legislative session this year.,17,,
48,0.97,376.275,383.816,"And with that, I will turn it over to Lily, who I believe will do some introductions.",17,,
49,0.97,383.816,387.32,Thank you so much Council President Herbold.,18,,
50,0.97,387.32,393.459,I did notice Andrew Lewis may have had his hand up with a question about your President's report.,18,,
51,0.97,393.459,398.264,I don't know if he's still there.,18,,
52,0.97,398.264,398.898,"Thank you, director.",18,,
53,0.97,398.898,404.036,I did not see a raised hand.,19,,
54,0.97,404.036,405.905,"It wasn't urgent, Councilmember Herbold.",20,,
55,0.97,405.905,430.163,"I just want today ask a clarification on your report the chief and the discipline of the incident commander during the pink umbrella riot, or rather police use of force on the crowd there and their Declaration of a riot.",20,,
56,0.97,430.163,440.807,"I wonder, given with the new evidence, did the chief clarify your question regarding whether the chief is taking it upon himself to conduct this further investigation?",20,,
57,0.97,440.807,450.016,"Or has the chief shared the information known to them, but that wasn't known to OPA with OPA, so OPA can conduct the investigation?",20,,
58,0.97,450.016,463.863,"I guess my question is, is the chief conducting an internal investigation, which seems it would be outside of the confines of the system we've set up, where we don't expect the police to investigate themselves.",20,,
59,0.97,463.863,467.433,We expect OPA to do it.,20,,
60,0.97,467.433,472.939,"I'm just kind of curious where that stands, and if that was in the answer to your questions.",20,,
61,0.97,472.939,482.315,"There is a lack of clarity, I think in the chief's statement, both in his response to me and the public statement that has been issued.",21,,
62,0.97,482.315,491.257,It refers to being able to quickly and fully reach a conclude on who was accountable for the actions on this day.,21,,
63,0.97,491.257,504.337,"References, additional information that has surfaced which was not included in the original investigation, but is not specifically addressed the question of the scope of this new information who is conducting it.",21,,
64,0.97,504.337,505.738,And I agree with you.,21,,
65,0.97,505.738,508.174,"Councilmember Lewis, those are really critical questions.",21,,
66,0.97,508.174,523.856,I would just say it's extremely concerning if the police Department was in possession of information that was of this Surveyty and decided to withhold it from the OPA and that has to be something that there needs to be answers to.,22,,
67,0.97,523.856,530.796,"And if they're still maintaining that information within the confines of SPD, and not giving it to OPA, that's something that has to be addressed.",22,,
68,0.97,530.796,533.065,I just want to put that out there.,22,,
69,0.97,533.065,537.27,It may be the case that's all been disclosed.,22,,
70,0.97,537.27,541.574,I would like that clarification from the Department.,22,,
71,0.97,541.574,546.078,I know that our briefings here are watched by folks on the executive side.,22,,
72,0.97,546.078,553.085,So I anticipate that these comments are enough to put them on notice that I would expect that kind of clarification.,22,,
73,0.97,553.085,571.504,"And I think, I speak for most of my colleagues here that it seems like some norms are not being followed, and I would like to know when that information was discovered, and how long they held it before they gave it to OPA.",22,,
74,0.97,571.504,572.738,But in any event.,22,,
75,0.97,572.738,573.039,Thank you.,22,,
76,0.97,573.039,574.807,Those are my only questions.,22,,
77,0.97,574.807,577.043,"I appreciate that, Councilmember Lewis.",23,,
78,0.97,577.043,615.514,"I think you're playing a finer point on what was inherent in my original questions of concern, and potentially alarm that the fact that there are others involved in the decision to make an order to Dispurse and the decision to use tear gas and glass balls that apparently, that was information that was known and it was not Divulged to the OPA, but I do want to learn more before I rush to judgment.",23,,
79,0.97,615.514,618.484,But that potentially is Concurring.,23,,
80,0.97,618.484,618.784,All right.,23,,
81,0.97,618.784,637.67,So let's turn it over to our friends at the office of Intergovernmental Relationsment I believe we were going to hear from Cadega from an opening statement.,23,,
82,0.97,637.67,638.337,Thank you so much.,24,,
83,0.97,638.337,648.914,We are before you today with our final report where we will review the Council's 2021 legislative priorities.,24,,
84,0.97,648.914,666.565,"What bills advanced and what is held primarily Online, which there were some concerns about, but turned out to be a productive one.",24,,
85,0.97,666.565,670.669,The goals were to maintain four areas of policymaking.,24,,
86,0.97,670.669,677.576,I think we highlighted that initially when we did our first round of briefings to you all.,24,,
87,0.97,677.576,680.98,Those areas were Covid response and recovery.,24,,
88,0.97,680.98,682.882,Budget and revenue.,24,,
89,0.97,682.882,683.449,Police reform and climate.,24,,
90,0.97,683.449,705.705,"They made significant progress in all of these areas, particularly in the context of a primarily virtual session, having advanced many long standing Democratic, and Progressive priorities, including investing $1 billion to address the Covid-19 pandemic through things like vaccine access, contact tracing, and public health testing.",24,,
91,0.97,705.705,715.114,Over $1 billion in housing and homelessness with $658 million specifically allocated for rental assistance.,24,,
92,0.97,715.114,723.789,"Passing a 7% tax on capital gains in excess of 250K on a razor thin, 25-24 vote in the Senate.",24,,
93,0.97,723.789,729.095,"A long standing Democratic priority, and notably one of Speaker Jenkins as well.",24,,
94,0.97,729.095,734.433,Advancing several significant criminal justice and police reform bills.,24,,
95,0.97,734.433,755.988,"Robin will review more extensively in her portfolio today, as well as a host of investments and support for working families, Undocument workers, and many in the immigrant, and refugee community with a 343 immigrant relief Fund, excluded from the last rounds of Federal aide.",24,,
96,0.97,755.988,778.811,"Councilmember Mosqueda, I think worked on this in her time as an advocate in the Legislature, but they also finally funded the working family's tax credit, which Hanna Smith will review more in-depth.",24,,
97,0.97,778.811,785.584,"Lastly, historic gains were also made in the environmental fuel.",24,,
98,0.97,785.584,799.598,"The clean fuel legislation finally advancing in an effort to reduce our state's carbon Footprint, and redirect those resources to a cleaner energy economy, that will also dive into more extensively.",24,,
99,0.97,799.598,806.839,"In terms of format for today, this will look just slightly different than our regular briefings through the legislative session.",24,,
100,0.97,806.839,813.345,"We're going to start focusing on budget, with a budget overview, starting with a revenue update.",24,,
101,0.97,813.345,818.617,"Robin will speak to investment, specifically in the housing and homelessness in Seattle.",24,,
102,0.97,818.617,821.72,Hanna will go over Healthcare and Childcare.,24,,
103,0.97,821.72,824.089,"Lastly, Quinn will review transportation budget items.",24,,
104,0.97,824.089,837.036,"If you all wouldn't mind holding questions until the end of this first part of our report, so we can bump all those budget questions to the end, we would appreciate that, just as many of these areas intersect.",24,,
105,0.97,837.036,852.985,"After we respond to any questions you have, after we review the budget, for part two, we will finish with a policy update, and we'll go through as we have done through the legislative session with everyone reporting on our individual portfolios.",24,,
106,0.97,852.985,861.293,"If that part sounds good, I will turn it over to our state director to start us off on budget and revenue.",24,,
107,0.97,861.293,861.827,Wonderful.,25,,
108,0.97,861.827,867.366,"Thank you so much, Lily, and thank you Councilmembers for having us here this morning.",25,,
109,0.97,867.366,874.173,"To kick things off, we're going to be speaking about the three budgets.",25,,
110,0.97,874.173,876.875,"The capital operating, and transportation budgets.",25,,
111,0.97,876.875,882.982,"And as Lily outlined, we're going to be talking about some of the major investments there.",25,,
112,0.97,882.982,886.852,We do have a more detailed summary through Email.,25,,
113,0.97,886.852,890.923,"We're not going to go through the individual budgets, but we're going to hit the highlights.",25,,
114,0.97,890.923,896.695,"If you have any questions in there, we can address those at the end of our budget session.",25,,
115,0.97,896.695,912.645,"The legislator took historic action this session in passing one of the most long standing proposals for writing some of the upside down nature of our state's tax structure, Bypassing the capital gains tax.",25,,
116,0.97,912.645,921.887,The proposal that they passed is in many ways similar to the ones that we have reported on previously during our updates.,25,,
117,0.97,921.887,931.897,"It establishes a 7% tax on capital gains over $250,000 per year, for a single, and joint Filelers.",25,,
118,0.97,931.897,934.767,That collection will start next year.,25,,
119,0.97,934.767,942.675,It provides a number of exemptions for retirement savings for all real estate and for the sale of qualifying small family owned businesses.,25,,
120,0.97,942.675,952.217,Small family owned businesses have to be under 10 million in gross receipts annually.,25,,
121,0.97,952.217,965.297,"They have to be owned by a family member for at least five years prior to the sale, and the family member has to be involved in operations for at least the five years prior to a sale.",25,,
122,0.97,965.297,977.076,"The final version that ultimately passed coming out of the conference Committee, where the house and Senate get together, and agree on the final version of the bill, did add one not exemption, but one additional deduction.",25,,
123,0.97,977.076,983.549,"So up to $100,000 in charitable donations may be deducted from taxes owed for a given year.",25,,
124,0.97,983.549,994.193,"So if you donate up to $100,000 up to a qualifying charity, then that amount would be deducted from the amount that you owe, over $250,000.",25,,
125,0.97,994.193,1000.733,Some changes were made in the final version for where the proceeds are directed.,25,,
126,0.97,1000.733,1009.942,The first $500 million in Annualrevenues are deposited into the trust fund.,25,,
127,0.97,1009.942,1025.624,"The fair start program, which is the omnibus child fund that Hanna will speak to is not specifically named here, but it is the intent to fund programs like that, with these proceeds, so investing in early learning and Childcare.",25,,
128,0.97,1025.624,1033.031,Then any amounts in excess of $500 million per year are deposited into the common school's construction account.,25,,
129,0.97,1033.031,1036.001,"Which is a, it does what it say it is does.",25,,
130,0.97,1036.001,1043.842,It's an account that is used to fund capital improvements and construction of schools in the K12 system.,25,,
131,0.97,1043.842,1049.548,"That's, that was the major action on progressive revenue Thissession.",25,,
132,0.97,1049.548,1060.092,"Other proposals like the wealth tax, and estate tax reform did not pass, but will certainly be on the docket for next session.",25,,
133,0.97,1060.092,1064.763,"This is a historic, and significant improvement to our tax structure.",25,,
134,0.97,1064.763,1072.571,"I know there is some interest also in sort of the after effects here, and the emergency clause and sort of what happens next.",25,,
135,0.97,1072.571,1077.042,We can speak to that a little bit.,25,,
136,0.97,1077.042,1093.926,"The emergency clause, which would stipulate the legislation goes into effect immediately, and also typically has the effect of preventing a referendum from being filed, that was ultimately not included on the capital gains tax legislation that was passed.",25,,
137,0.97,1093.926,1103.068,"However, they did include a clause, a provision that has fallen out of favor, but was used more commonly in the '80s, and '90s.",25,,
138,0.97,1103.068,1114.913,"What's called a necessity clause, which stipulates that the progressions of the legislation are necessary for the operation of general government.",25,,
139,0.97,1114.913,1122.588,"This is believed according to case law from, you know, the '80s, and '90s.",25,,
140,0.97,1122.588,1128.594,"This will have a similar effect, and in prohibiting a referendum from being filed there.",25,,
141,0.97,1128.594,1133.632,"There is already one lawsuit, and there will likely be others related to the capital gains tax.",25,,
142,0.97,1133.632,1136.735,So there will still be legal challenges.,25,,
143,0.97,1136.735,1140.739,"And you know, another thing would prevent an initiative in future years.",25,,
144,0.97,1140.739,1149.648,"But in terms of the implementation, it is expected to move forward, pending legal challenges this year.",25,,
145,0.97,1149.648,1161.994,"With that, I will hand it over to Robin to speak to housing and homelessness investments.",25,,
146,0.97,1161.994,1162.561,"Good morning, everyone.",26,,
147,0.97,1162.561,1171.503,"So in both the capital and the operating budget, there were some fairly significant investments in housing in homelessness.",26,,
148,0.97,1171.503,1182.548,"Though we didn't quite get to the level that has been proposed by Governor Newsom in California, we did get some very significant investments on the capital sides of things.",26,,
149,0.97,1182.548,1192.925,"1.75Million for the housing trust fund, and then $120 million for rapid acquisition of shelter and affordable housing.",26,,
150,0.97,1192.925,1198.664,Another significant place of investment was $42 million for utility connection fees.,26,,
151,0.97,1198.664,1203.001,"You know, that are experienced while constructing affordable housing.",26,,
152,0.97,1203.001,1212.544,"Then $10 million for the Weatherization plus health program, which the office of housing accesses to Weatherize low income homeowners' homes across the city.",26,,
153,0.97,1212.544,1217.849,There were some set asides in the capital budget.,26,,
154,0.97,1217.849,1222.421,$4Million for the Bell weather project.,26,,
155,0.97,1222.421,1239.171,"$5Million of the rapid acquisition partner for the Claya funds, that in operation with Lehigh helped to acquire that $80 million building that immediately was purchased, and immediately was turned into affordable housing.",26,,
156,0.97,1239.171,1245.143,We certainly hope to access more of these funding to be able to do more of that in the coming months.,26,,
157,0.97,1245.143,1254.353,"Finally, $4 million for the nursing home was another set aside that we received in Seattle.",26,,
158,0.97,1254.353,1259.858,Lily mentioned there's $658 million for rent assistance.,26,,
159,0.97,1259.858,1261.793,"Obviously, a pretty big amount.",26,,
160,0.97,1261.793,1287.653,"I spoke with the Department of Commerce late last week, and they informed me they do expect to get those dollars out in the same way that they have with the previous dollars, so that I predict, and don't quote me on this, things may change slightly, but I believe we accessed around 30% of the funds in King County, so I think it's likely that that's what we'll see from this investment as well.",26,,
161,0.97,1287.653,1291.69,There was $187 million included for foreclosure prevention.,26,,
162,0.97,1291.69,1295.46,And $26.5 million increase in the housing essential needs program.,26,,
163,0.97,1295.46,1306.738,I understand that that will allow us to serve the wait list of people who have not been able to access the program due to budget limitations.,26,,
164,0.97,1306.738,1313.245,"So that is very good news, and I do believe that many of those people are in King County.",26,,
165,0.97,1313.245,1326.024,"We'll also be seeing $58.4 million for operations, maintenance, and services for permanent supportive housing from House bill 1277, that I'll talk a little bit more about in the policy discussion.",26,,
166,0.97,1326.024,1343.842,"That is up and above of the $37 million that's already in the budget, so that is a very significant investment from the Legislature in permanent supportive housing that we really need to make sure that when we make a capital investment in housing, that we're able to operate the building for the low income tenants that live there.",26,,
167,0.97,1343.842,1353.652,"Then $22.1 million also from the document recording fees bill, will go to fund unsheltered homelessness.",26,,
168,0.97,1353.652,1362.361,"It includes Project-Based vouchers, emergency housing, addiction prevention, rental assistance, as well as the possibility to use some of those dollars for acquisition.",26,,
169,0.97,1362.361,1369.935,"Finally, another significant investment of $19.7 million for long term vouchers for people with behavioral health or substance abuse disorders.",26,,
170,0.97,1369.935,1380.645,"Those funds are very significant as well as they intend to be us incur the, and be an ongoing appropriation, and not just a one time Fund.",26,,
171,0.97,1380.645,1388.386,"I think that's all that I have, and now we'll talk about other exciting budget investments.",26,,
172,0.97,1388.386,1388.653,Yes.,27,,
173,0.97,1388.653,1402.801,"In the Childcare and early learning space, we had very significant investments, given that the pandemic shed light on the existing Childcare budget crisis.",27,,
174,0.97,1402.801,1406.805,I'll speak to the policies in that later.,27,,
175,0.97,1406.805,1412.01,Also invested over $757 million in a variety of child care programs.,27,,
176,0.97,1412.01,1421.353,That includes $400 million for Childcare stabilization Grands.,27,,
177,0.97,1421.353,1424.623,"That includes payroll reimbursement, and operating instructions.",27,,
178,0.97,1424.623,1436.434,We believe that the providers in Seattle will be well positioned to receive some of those funds.,27,,
179,0.97,1436.434,1445.377,The others focus on early learning childhood education assistance program.,27,,
180,0.97,1445.377,1446.745,That's $146.6 million.,27,,
181,0.97,1446.745,1449.181,Over $100 million for eligibility expansion.,27,,
182,0.97,1449.181,1464.963,"Nearly $25 million to expand the Eceap slots by over 1200 Inned next Yew years, and an additional $84.5 million for fair starts for kids and other Childcare programs.",27,,
183,0.97,1464.963,1467.265,So really great investments there in the early learning space.,27,,
184,0.97,1467.265,1473.004,There's also a lot of great news in Healthcare.,27,,
185,0.97,1473.004,1488.22,"Advocates have been asking for increased funding for publication of public health Foreyears, which has been under funded even before the pandemic and this year, invested 149- point $5 million in that space.",27,,
186,0.97,1488.22,1501.466,"There's also $35 million in grants for those who are under insured, an an additional $15 million for Cascade care.",27,,
187,0.97,1501.466,1509.241,"That helps with premium assistance for individuals, earning up to 55% of the poverty level.",27,,
188,0.97,1509.241,1514.179,Some other significant funds with Federal funding.,27,,
189,0.97,1514.179,1515.513,The $340 million for immigrant relief.,27,,
190,0.97,1515.513,1520.252,There's over $1 billion for Covid response and vaccine deployment.,27,,
191,0.97,1520.252,1525.223,"And significant investments in unemployment insurance benefits, and small business assistance.",27,,
192,0.97,1525.223,1545.81,"I will speak to some of the other significant safety net investments related to policy bills like the Kenneth, and working family's tax credit section . et there in the policy I think with that, we'll turn it over to Quinn for transportation.",27,,
193,0.97,1545.81,1547.512,"Thanks, Hanna.",28,,
194,0.97,1547.512,1554.419,"In the transportation space, the Legislature ultimately did not take action on a transportation revenue package this session.",28,,
195,0.97,1554.419,1567.732,"At the towards the end of the session, there was sort of a late push, but the house and Senate remained too far apart on the overall size of what a transportation revenue package should look like.",28,,
196,0.97,1567.732,1570.635,The final House proposal was around $22 billion.,28,,
197,0.97,1570.635,1576.241,The final Senate proposal was around $18 billion.,28,,
198,0.97,1576.241,1585.016,They remained far apart on the split between roads and highway investments and Multi-Motal investments.,28,,
199,0.97,1585.016,1599.564,"There were differences in the revenues proposed between gas tax, carbon, or cap and invest revenues, as well as a Smattering of others.",28,,
200,0.97,1599.564,1604.703,Those are outlined in the summary that we sent previously on the different proposals on transportation.,28,,
201,0.97,1604.703,1609.374,"None of that's changed since we sent that a few weeks ago, and I'm happy to Reup that.",28,,
202,0.97,1609.374,1616.615,"But ultimately, the house and Senate remained too far apart to reach an agreement prior to the conclusion of session.",28,,
203,0.97,1616.615,1621.753,There is still a significant interest in taking action on transportation.,28,,
204,0.97,1621.753,1650.181,"Both because of the need for investment in infrastructure, but also because, as we'll get to in the policy section, two of the most significant environmental policies that were adopted this session, the cap and invest program as well as the clean fuel standard program have both been made contingent through their implementation has been made through a supplemental revenue package.",28,,
205,0.97,1650.181,1655.32,"There is going to be a continued, and renewed interest on reaching agreement.",28,,
206,0.97,1655.32,1661.226,There has been some talk about dressing that in a potential special legislative session.,28,,
207,0.97,1661.226,1670.001,I just want to provide an update on what we've heard with regards to that.,28,,
208,0.97,1670.001,1687.585,"A transportation revenue package is perhaps among the more, I don't want to say secretive, but negotiations are often private between house and chair.",28,,
209,0.97,1687.585,1688.486,This information can change quickly.,28,,
210,0.97,1688.486,1698.763,"But as best as we've heard from our sources in talking to legislator, it seems unlikely they will do a special session only for a state transportation revenue package.",28,,
211,0.97,1698.763,1707.272,What is likely to occur is they would tackle legislation in a special session if they needed to for another reason.,28,,
212,0.97,1707.272,1725.79,"The most likely reason is if there was a Federal infrastructure package that was passed, the Legislature made it clear, they want to have a say in how Federal dollars are allocated, especially when it comes to future stimulus package, and Federal infrastructure package.",28,,
213,0.97,1725.79,1729.994,They don't just want to leave that up to the state executive.,28,,
214,0.97,1729.994,1740.939,"So if a Federal infrastructure package was adopted, it would be a potential for them to come back for a special session, and they could tackle statement transportation investments at the same time.",28,,
215,0.97,1740.939,1756.287,"The other potential, hopefully less likely, but potential reason they would need to have a special session would be if any of the Federal funds that they propose appropriated on how that money can be spend.",28,,
216,0.97,1756.287,1763.161,"There's no sense necessarily that that is going to happen, but it does have potential as we continue to get ongoing guidance from the Federal Government.",28,,
217,0.97,1763.161,1767.732,So they could potentially need to come back for that reason.,28,,
218,0.97,1767.732,1780.178,"So given those potential factors it is likely if there is a special session, it would occur sometime in the fall, based on what we're hearing around the Timeline for a 45- year-old package.",28,,
219,0.97,1780.178,1794.726,"Given that, you know, it is also possible if it's late enough involved that they would simply roll it into the 2022 legislative session, and not have a special session.",28,,
220,0.97,1794.726,1808.84,"So that's the current status of the transportation revenue package, and the negotiations are expected to continue through the interim between the house and Senate chairs and ranking members and vice chairs.",28,,
221,0.97,1808.84,1818.416,"I do want to speak quickly too, just because the Legislaure didn't adopt a revenue package doesn't mean they didn't pass the baseline current law.",28,,
222,0.97,1818.416,1824.255,There's not a whole lot in there.,28,,
223,0.97,1824.255,1833.431,The legislature was forced to use $1 billion to meet its ongoing commitments and obligations in the transportation budget.,28,,
224,0.97,1833.431,1836.1,$600Million to shore up declining revenues.,28,,
225,0.97,1836.1,1847.445,$400Million to meet the ongoing obligation for Culverts and removing fish passage barriers that the Supreme Court's decision requires.,28,,
226,0.97,1847.445,1851.449,There were a handful of investments that the city might benefit from.,28,,
227,0.97,1851.449,1854.719,$5Million in additional funding for safe routes to schools.,28,,
228,0.97,1854.719,1859.19,$5Million for the pedestrian and bicycle safety grant program.,28,,
229,0.97,1859.19,1865.53,$5Million for green capital transportation grants and $4 million for apprenticeship and support services.,28,,
230,0.97,1865.53,1868.9,Those are all grant programs that we need to apply for.,28,,
231,0.97,1868.9,1876.441,"So nothing directly to the city, but some additional funding that ultimately might come to benefit us.",28,,
232,0.97,1876.441,1879.444,I believe that concludes our presentation on the budgets.,28,,
233,0.97,1879.444,1884.849,So I think we'll pause there for questions.,28,,
234,0.97,1884.849,1890.989,I do see some questions in the Queue here.,29,,
235,0.97,1890.989,1891.689,Councilmember Pedersen.,29,,
236,0.97,1891.689,1894.025,"Thank you, president pro Tem Herbold.",30,,
237,0.97,1894.025,1907.038,"Thank you for all your work this session and for summing up the budget and I really appreciate your continued gathering of information, and Intel on transportation in particular.",30,,
238,0.97,1907.038,1929.06,"I am disappointed that the state Legislature couldn't come together to produce a transportation package, and then it's disconcerting, while it makes sense, it's disconcerting that they would wait for the Federal Government to act, since an infrastructure bill will be tied up by just a couple of U.S. senators.",30,,
239,0.97,1929.06,1942.373,And so I just want to signal my interest in making sure we tackle transportation budgetary issues this fall.,30,,
240,0.97,1942.373,1952.25,"And we'll have to, our needs are so great with infrastructure in Seattle, we should make a very strong down payment, I'm hoping in this fall budget process with this city.",30,,
241,0.97,1952.25,1958.189,"I do have a question about rental assistance, actually.",30,,
242,0.97,1958.189,1970.301,"I was really heartened to see all the rental assistance, and the need, the great need, especially to address the great need, has emerged from the Covid pandemic.",30,,
243,0.97,1970.301,1973.771,I think this question might be for Robin.,30,,
244,0.97,1973.771,1983.981,"Were there any set asides for students experiencing homelessness, or children experiencing homelessness?",30,,
245,0.97,1983.981,1987.218,I know we're looking at some regulatory changes here at the city level.,30,,
246,0.97,1987.218,1996.828,But I just wanted to know if there were dollars coming from the state for those who are in school.,30,,
247,0.97,1996.828,1999.163,"Yes, there were, Councilmember Pedersen.",31,,
248,0.97,1999.163,2011.476,"It's a little complicated, because it's in several places in the budget, but there is $4.6 million for homeless student stability, that would serve K through 12 students as I understand it.",31,,
249,0.97,2011.476,2049.947,"But then there's also some funds through various different places throughout the budget, including the student achievement Council, and the universities to serve students experiencing homelessness below are college students: I can certainly make sure that I go through and provide you with all of the details of each, you know, I think there's a little bit peppered through all of the different University budgets and I can go through, and carefully look and get that to you.",31,,
250,0.97,2049.947,2056.721,"With that much rental assistance getting out on the street, $658 million would be available for families as well.",31,,
251,0.97,2056.721,2064.796,But there's definitely multiple ways for people to access rental assistance this year through the budget.,31,,
252,0.97,2064.796,2067.498,Thank you very much.,32,,
253,0.97,2067.498,2067.865,Thank you.,33,,
254,0.97,2067.865,2077.942,"Looking to see whether or not I see any virtual raised hands or real raised hands, and I see none.",33,,
255,0.97,2077.942,2084.515,So we'll move on to the policy bill updates.,33,,
256,0.97,2084.515,2091.956,"Would you like me to pause after each policy area update, or would you prefer that we wait until the end?",33,,
257,0.97,2091.956,2100.198,"That would be great, president pro Tem, if we could pause after each portfolio.",34,,
258,0.97,2100.198,2104.535,I think we'll start with education.,34,,
259,0.97,2104.535,2106.037,Hanna Smith's portfolio to start.,34,,
260,0.97,2106.037,2106.771,"Thanks, Lily.",35,,
261,0.97,2106.771,2115.012,The big news in the education space is the franchise for kids act.,35,,
262,0.97,2115.012,2123.721,"Senate bill 257, it expands eligibility, and decreases Copayment for the working connections Childcare program.",35,,
263,0.97,2123.721,2127.024,Expands eligibility for the early learning.,35,,
264,0.97,2127.024,2129.66,Early childhood education assistance program.,35,,
265,0.97,2129.66,2136.501,"It provides rate increases, training grants, support, and services for Childcare and early learning providers.",35,,
266,0.97,2136.501,2146.878,"Increases Pre-Natal to 3 supports, and Waives the working requirement for parents who are students in the working connections Childcare program.",35,,
267,0.97,2146.878,2157.121,These are all just the policy Accompanimentses.,35,,
268,0.97,2157.121,2163.494,"I've mentioned a diversity of separate breakdown of all of these funds, as a separate attachment.",35,,
269,0.97,2163.494,2174.438,"The legislature expanded college bound access, and passed a bill to include Anti- racism, and diversity training in higher education institutions.",35,,
270,0.97,2174.438,2177.508,So those are the big highlights in the education space.,35,,
271,0.97,2177.508,2179.277,So I'll pause for questions.,35,,
272,0.97,2179.277,2188.019,"Any question, Councilmembers on the education updates?",36,,
273,0.97,2188.019,2194.525,"All right, seeing no questions, let's move onto the next section.",36,,
274,0.97,2194.525,2205.469,"Some rather significant pieces of legislation were adopted in the environmental space, and I'll do my best to cover them as quickly, and comprehensively as possible.",37,,
275,0.97,2205.469,2210.575,Perhaps the most Chicago is Senate bill 5126.,37,,
276,0.97,2210.575,2212.476,This is the climate commitment act.,37,,
277,0.97,2212.476,2218.449,"Also known more commonly as cap and investor, cap and trade.",37,,
278,0.97,2218.449,2226.29,"This was sponsored by Senator Carlyle, and it establishes a cap and trade system in Washington state.",37,,
279,0.97,2226.29,2228.392,The legislative bill summary was 22 pages.,37,,
280,0.97,2228.392,2236.033,"I did my best to condense that down, and I'll cover that as comprehensively as possible in the report.",37,,
281,0.97,2236.033,2237.068,It's a big bill.,37,,
282,0.97,2237.068,2243.841,"So if you have questions or any additional information, we can certainly follow up on those pieces.",37,,
283,0.97,2243.841,2256.02,"So under the legislation, the Department of Ecology is directed to establish rules that require emissions reductions for covered entities.",37,,
284,0.97,2256.02,2266.764,"Covered entities are stationary carbon Emitters that generate more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon annually.",37,,
285,0.97,2266.764,2282.747,"It starts January 1, 2023, and runs through December 26th, 2026 arrange understand there is a detailed sub consequent for your compliance periods that follow, along with a Parallelled review, and justice process of that program.",37,,
286,0.97,2282.747,2300.431,"Notably in that review and adjustment process, Ecology must conduct an environmental justice review every two years to ensure that the program is achieving emissions reductions targets in overburdened communities highly impacted by air pollution and sort of Tinker with the knobs and dials on the program.",37,,
287,0.97,2300.431,2310.708,"If those goals are not being met, Ecology has to establish a system of managing and auctioning allowances.",37,,
288,0.97,2310.708,2313.511,This is the trade portion of cap and trade.,37,,
289,0.97,2313.511,2321.218,Those auctions have to occur at least four times annually.,37,,
290,0.97,2321.218,2353.351,"There's regulations over how much an Enty can purchase of allowances at a given auction, and Ecology must adopt additional rules to prohibit collusion, raise the potential for market manipulation, and ensure there's sufficient innocent Incentivation.",37,,
291,0.97,2353.351,2363.327,"California and British Columbia whether feasible to broaden the greenhouse gas emission Redukdz opportunities, and achieve a variety of other goals.",37,,
292,0.97,2363.327,2382.78,"Prior to entering these linkage agreements, Ecology must conduct an environmental assessment, to assure those linkages would benefit not just the program, but reduce emissions in Over-Burdened communities.",37,,
293,0.97,2382.78,2394.258,The legislation also establishes that off credit emissions for covered entities to reach their requirements.,37,,
294,0.97,2394.258,2407.538,"Offset credits by a credit committee investing in a capital project, essentially, and those capital projects must demonstrate, sorry, are not located on the facility, but they are located in other areas.",37,,
295,0.97,2407.538,2419.884,"Projects have to demonstrate greenhouse gas reductions or Removals that are real, permanent, quantity Fiable, verifiable, and enforceable.",37,,
296,0.97,2419.884,2429.093,55% of those credits have to be located in Washington state during the first period.,37,,
297,0.97,2429.093,2430.427,And 75% following periods.,37,,
298,0.97,2430.427,2440.571,"Those vary by compliance period, and also whether or not the covered entity is on federally recognized tribal land.",37,,
299,0.97,2440.571,2448.045,"The revenues from the program, the cap and invest program is expected to generate some significant revenues.",37,,
300,0.97,2448.045,2454.552,Those revenues are directed to be allocated in sort of a variety of ways.,37,,
301,0.97,2454.552,2471.469,But notably across all of these different allocations a minimum of 35% of investments must provide a direct and meaningful benefit to populations overburdened by carbon pollution and emissions.,37,,
302,0.97,2471.469,2482.046,So the program creates a variety of different accounts that are the recipient funds and doll out the revenues that are generated.,37,,
303,0.97,2482.046,2486.884,The first account is the carbon reduction account.,37,,
304,0.97,2486.884,2491.922,It receives the first $5.2 billion over the first 16 years of the program.,37,,
305,0.97,2491.922,2506.27,"It receives a specific amount Úeach year so it's not just the first 5.2 billion, but it's the first specific amount each year over using that sort of specific amortization schedule.",37,,
306,0.97,2506.27,2519.583,"The purpose of this account, this is the account that is connected to the potential transportation revenue package, and would fund transportation carbon reduction purposes.",37,,
307,0.97,2519.583,2523.687,"It is specifically used for 18th amendment purposes, 18th amendment is highways.",37,,
308,0.97,2523.687,2536.534,"After funds are received by the carbon emission reduction account, they are received by the climate invest account, and those accounts are immediately sub routed to different accounts.",37,,
309,0.97,2536.534,2543.941,75% of those funds are allocated to the climate commitment account.,37,,
310,0.97,2543.941,2554.485,The climate commitment account funds a variety of programs that are designed to transition to a more clean and just economy.,37,,
311,0.97,2554.485,2566.03,"It's intended to fund an Onworking fund for the tax credit, which Han will speak to more in a bit.",37,,
312,0.97,2566.03,2566.63,Environmental review funds.,37,,
313,0.97,2566.63,2578.075,Then support a whole array of projects that promote Electrification and clean energy.,37,,
314,0.97,2578.075,2588.519,"The appropriations here are anything in, any appropriations for the climate commitment can are subject to legislative information.",37,,
315,0.97,2588.519,2590.154,Rule making is going to take some time.,37,,
316,0.97,2590.154,2592.923,I'm speak to that in just a minute.,37,,
317,0.97,2592.923,2595.392,But these will be subject to legislative appropriations.,37,,
318,0.97,2595.392,2616.313,It's not clear if that means that the Legislature is sort of going to get into the weeds in identifying specific projects or if like other grant programs that are subject to legislative programs it will be largely determined by the Department of Ecology and then ratified by the Legislature.,37,,
319,0.97,2616.313,2622.72,So that's something we're going to look into.,37,,
320,0.97,2622.72,2639.003,The natural climate solutions act is required to fund project programs and activities that increase the resilience of our state's waters force and other viable Ecosystems as well as fund clean water investments.,37,,
321,0.97,2639.003,2656.52,I know at the final briefing that we gave prior to this briefing before the conclusion of the legislative session I had flagged that there were some late concerns about this legislation potentially Preempting our ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in any way.,37,,
322,0.97,2656.52,2659.89,That did not come to pass.,37,,
323,0.97,2659.89,2660.19,Very good.,37,,
324,0.97,2660.19,2670.501,"But the legislation does make some changes to how local governments and state agencies, what they can do in terms of the climate space.",37,,
325,0.97,2670.501,2690.788,"So no state agency can adopt, or enforce rules or regulations or programs that regulate greenhouse gas emissions from Constitutionary sources, except stationary sources.",37,,
326,0.97,2690.788,2698.862,No local government can implement a charge or tax based exclusively on the greenhouse gas emissions.,37,,
327,0.97,2698.862,2705.636,So it does preempt cities and counties from adopting essentially local carbon taxes.,37,,
328,0.97,2705.636,2714.745,"Then the climate, or the cabinet invest program also supersedes the state's clean air rule.",37,,
329,0.97,2714.745,2718.515,It does Supersede any existing regulations there.,37,,
330,0.97,2718.515,2722.953,"Then Finally, in this section, and I apologize for the length.",37,,
331,0.97,2722.953,2725.889,It's a very long bill.,37,,
332,0.97,2725.889,2739.069,"As I mentioned in transportation, this bill and the clean fuels program, which I'll speak to in adjustment a moment, are both contingent.",37,,
333,0.97,2739.069,2755.919,"The compliance obligations are contingent on an added transportation funding measure, that is defined as a gas tax increase of at least 5 cents a gal.",37,,
334,0.97,2755.919,2761.325,"That process is expected to take at least a year, potentially upwards of two years.",37,,
335,0.97,2761.325,2777.541,"So the program can get off and running, but the Legislature does need to adopt a transportation package before it can begin, it is subject to begin in 2023.",37,,
336,0.97,2777.541,2780.043,That is the climate commitment act.,37,,
337,0.97,2780.043,2784.281,There are couple of other bills I also want to review quickly.,37,,
338,0.97,2784.281,2785.549,Because they're also significant.,37,,
339,0.97,2785.549,2796.126,"The legislature also approved after I believe five years of really significant work by the prime sponsor representative fits given, the clean fuel standard.",37,,
340,0.97,2796.126,2797.928,This is House bill 10-91.,37,,
341,0.97,2797.928,2804.968,"This is in many ways, almost similar to cap investment for transportation fuels.",37,,
342,0.97,2804.968,2817.247,"So it requires the Department of Ecology to Promulgate rules, that would require a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2038.",37,,
343,0.97,2817.247,2828.692,There are also requirements in there that would stipulate that they cannot require carbon reductions more than 10% until certain factors are met.,37,,
344,0.97,2828.692,2830.727,15% in liquid Biofuel production.,37,,
345,0.97,2830.727,2840.103,At least one new extended liquid Biofuel facility.,37,,
346,0.97,2840.103,2846.777,"And a Reviewgy Jlar on the first five years was program, and the conclusion of the 2033 legislative session.",37,,
347,0.97,2846.777,2879.943,"So some Stipulations after the first 10%, but that first 10% is pretty well established, then the legislation also establishes that Ecology has to create a system of Bankable, and useable credits for clean fuel suppliers, which includes electric utilities, electric utilities supply clean fuel for cars, electric vehicles, which includes our own Seattle city light.",37,,
348,0.97,2879.943,2884.815,And how the revenues that are generated from these clean fuel credits can be spend.,37,,
349,0.97,2884.815,2891.855,So 50% have to be used for transportation Electrification.,37,,
350,0.97,2891.855,2907.437,"And the other 50% have to be spent on projects on a list that will be Requiredty the State Department of Ecology and education, that will also support Decarbonization.",37,,
351,0.97,2907.437,2920.284,"Similar to the cap invest, the rule making can begin immediately, but the compliance cannot start until a supplemental revenue package is adopted.",37,,
352,0.97,2920.284,2921.285,Two other bills quickly.,37,,
353,0.97,2921.285,2929.326,"The heal act, which provides for specific environmental Újustice requirements for state agencies was also adopted and approved.",37,,
354,0.97,2929.326,2940.237,So a number of state agencies have to incorporate environmental justice into strategic planning and agency budgeting.,37,,
355,0.97,2940.237,2947.077,"Conduct environmental justice assessments on action, which is significant rules, and grants.",37,,
356,0.97,2947.077,2955.352,And conduct specified community outreach and engagement planning for Over-Burdened communities.,37,,
357,0.97,2955.352,2963.427,"The one other piece of legislation, that didn't get quite as much attention, is Senate bill 252.",37,,
358,0.97,2963.427,2976.707,This would establish a schedule for minimum Post-Consumer recycled content standards for some of the most problematic plastic items.,37,,
359,0.97,2976.707,2979.209,Household cleaning and personal care products.,37,,
360,0.97,2979.209,2988.919,"Would also ban the sale of expanded polystyrene, more commonly known as Styrofoam in Washington state.",37,,
361,0.97,2988.919,2990.854,Which is a problematic plastic product.,37,,
362,0.97,2990.854,3002.466,"It would also require that single use utensil, straws, beverage lids, those sorts of things can only be offered by restaurants upon request of the customer.",37,,
363,0.97,3002.466,3014.111,"And then, establishes Stakeholder Committee, because the legislator Stakeholder committees to recommend further post consumer recycling standards for the 2022 legislative session.",37,,
364,0.97,3014.111,3020.851,"Those are the main, those are the big high profile bills.",37,,
365,0.97,3020.851,3021.818,I know it's a lot.,37,,
366,0.97,3021.818,3024.955,"I will pause there, and answer any questions to the best of my ability.",37,,
367,0.97,3024.955,3027.457,Thank you so much.,38,,
368,0.97,3027.457,3041.371,"That is quite a portfolio there, Quinn, and a lot of really impressive accomplishments in the state legislative session there, as it relates to our environmental agenda.",38,,
369,0.97,3041.371,3045.308,Looking again to see if my colleagues have any questions.,38,,
370,0.97,3045.308,3046.943,I'm looking in the present panel.,38,,
371,0.97,3046.943,3051.615,I just want to ask that people raise their hand in the participants panel.,38,,
372,0.97,3051.615,3056.153,Because I cannot see everybody in Realtime.,38,,
373,0.97,3056.153,3067.664,"Their pictures, and their real life hands.",38,,
374,0.97,3067.664,3076.406,"So not seeing any raised hands in the participants panel, so now let's move onto the Healthcare bill led by Hanna.",38,,

379,0.97,3089.352,3096.993,"I will just highlight that tax increment financing did pass, which I know is of interest to several members of the Council.",41,,
380,0.97,3096.993,3106.236,"So that is exciting, as did Juneteenth, which is the establishing Juneteenth as a legislative holiday.",41,,
381,0.97,3106.236,3117.681,"I think those are the only items, and we've talked about them pretty extensively, but I would highlight those as ones that we have followed, and are worth noting.",41,,
382,0.97,3117.681,3118.181,"Great, thank you.",42,,
383,0.97,3118.181,3123.987,I will now Scroll us down to Healthcare.,42,,
384,0.97,3123.987,3134.164,"One of the big bills to highlight is 1477, that's the National 988 number.",42,,
385,0.97,3134.164,3143.306,"The legislature established the bill or the number, and call centers to respond to both suicide and behavioral health calls.",42,,
386,0.97,3143.306,3157.02,"The bill imposes a tax on radio lines to pay for the technology, and creates a crisis response improvement strategy committee to develop the integrated behavioral health response and suicide prevention system.",42,,

391,0.97,3195.892,3202.332,"The legislature also passed again, the Postpartum Medicaid bill.",42,,
392,0.97,3202.332,3208.672,"You'll remember this passed last year, but was due to the crisis, and they needed Covid response.",42,,

399,0.97,3248.311,3248.979,"Thank you, Hanna.",43,,
400,0.97,3248.979,3265.061,"Taking a pause here to see if there is any questions, before moving onto the next section, which I believe is housing and homelessness.",43,,
401,0.97,3265.061,3266.363,Not seeing any raised hands.,43,,
402,0.97,3266.363,3280.944,"Robin, let's move onto housing and homelessness.",43,,
403,0.97,3281.411,3281.978,"You're on Muta, Robin.",44,,
404,0.97,3281.978,3289.119,Someone had to do it for final report.,45,,
405,0.97,3289.119,3292.222,Council President Herbold pointed out that I might have Misspoken.,45,,
406,0.97,3292.222,3307.871,"There's $175 million in the budget for the housing trust fund, as well as $120 million for acquisition of housing and shelter spaces.",45,,
407,0.97,3307.871,3324.521,"And then under the operating budget, which is a little bit further down, there is a, there are I think I may have said 22 million, but there's 209 million.",45,,
408,0.97,3324.521,3334.264,"Just letting everybody know, clarifying those numbers to be accurate, and you can go back to the other part of the bulletin at this point.",45,,
409,0.97,3334.264,3337.5,Sorry to make you switch it around so much.,45,,
410,0.97,3337.5,3360.69,So given the economic impacts of Covid-19 the Legislature was very focused this year and passed several important policy bills to work together to provide tenant projections and address homelessness in tandem with the rental assistance programs that are being deployed from the Federal dollars that the state received.,45,,
411,0.97,3360.69,3379.109,"One of the first things I want to talk about is the path Thats provided by the Legislature to end the Eviction moratorium that was enacted by the governor through executive action in last March, 20 of 20.",45,,
412,0.97,3379.109,3381.478,That bill is Senate bill 5160.,45,,
413,0.97,3381.478,3388.818,"It does a number of things to back us out, and provide an off ram.",45,,
414,0.97,3388.818,3392.722,The first is that it provides legal representation.,45,,
415,0.97,3392.722,3393.256,This is quite historic.,45,,
416,0.97,3393.256,3399.829,We're the first state in the country to pass such a law.,45,,
417,0.97,3399.829,3420.984,"Then it also creates the resolution pilot program, before Eviction can be filed in court, hoping to avoid some of the actions moving forward to an actual court action, and making sure that people don't end up with Evictions on their report.",45,,
418,0.97,3420.984,3429.459,It establishes reasonable payment plan parameters that are not to exceed 1/3Rd of monthly rent.,45,,
419,0.97,3429.459,3442.572,"It creates a program, where tenant who is vacate or default on payment plans, landlords can make themselves hold there, and it also creates a direct assistance to property owners.",45,,
420,0.97,3442.572,3458.454,"Finally, it prohibits late fee reporting of nonpayment, and taking adverse action against tenants based on nonpayment of rent from March 2020, through 6 months following the expiration of the Eviction more tier Yum.",45,,
421,0.97,3458.454,3471.801,"The Eviction moratorium does end on June 30th, the bill was was amended in the house.",45,,
422,0.97,3471.801,3486.082,"There is some concern over whether the right to Council provisions, as whether some of the rental assistance will fully be able to get out in the street by the time the June 30th moratorium expires.",45,,
423,0.97,3486.082,3494.257,"So it remains to be seen what will happen, so we're continuing advocacy on this issue.",45,,
424,0.97,3494.257,3496.192,And we can let you know where we stand on that.,45,,
425,0.97,3496.192,3502.065,But certainly something to be aware of right now.,45,,
426,0.97,3502.065,3519.716,"Then the bill that I mentioned bill 27, which adds an additional $100 to the document recording fees, that will raise $288 million over the Biennia, and is divided between the home security fund that I mentioned at $221 million.",45,,
427,0.97,3519.716,3523.119,It also provides funds for landlord mitigation.,45,,
428,0.97,3523.119,3525.588,$11.6Million over the buy Enyum.,45,,
429,0.97,3525.588,3530.86,"As I mentioned, that significant investment in permanent supporting housing maintenance, and services.",45,,
430,0.97,3530.86,3543.94,"I know another bill that you were all quite interested in was the just cause emergency bill, which requires property owners to provide a reason to terminate.",45,,
431,0.97,3543.94,3548.611,This bill is a little bit complicated.,45,,
432,0.97,3548.611,3567.931,"As far as specified time leases go with an initial term of 12 months around any subsequent term of 6 months, those leases may be terminated.",45,,
433,0.97,3567.931,3595.458,"The bill does prohibit month to month leases for a fixed term, except for 90 days, following the expiration of the moratorium of the there's a grace period to allow tenants and landlords to convert leases in that immediate period following the Eviction following the moratorium.",45,,
434,0.97,3595.458,3600.029,An exception for initial leases that have a term of 6 to 12 months.,45,,
435,0.97,3600.029,3602.432,"And same thing, the landlord has to provide 60 days notice.",45,,
436,0.97,3602.432,3614.477,I think it probably makes sense for me to just provide an Anin- writing summary of this bill.,45,,
437,0.97,3614.477,3617.747,I think the Washington housing alliance is also working on some summaries.,45,,
438,0.97,3617.747,3622.986,So I'll make sure that you all have detailed information about the parameters of the bill.,45,,
439,0.97,3622.986,3632.362,"Then Finally, the last bill that I wanted to mention was House bill 1220.",45,,
440,0.97,3632.362,3635.832,This Council wrote a letter in support of this bill.,45,,
441,0.97,3635.832,3649.078,"It requires planning for Aforwardable housing, and addresses, and to address racially disparate replacement, and permanent supportive housing in their zoning.",45,,
442,0.97,3649.078,3652.515,That's all I have for housing and homelessness.,45,,
443,0.97,3652.515,3656.119,I'm happy to take any questions if there are some.,45,,
444,0.97,3656.119,3658.888,"Thank you so much, Robin.",46,,
445,0.97,3658.888,3669.832,Looking to see whether or not there are any questions in this section.,46,,
446,0.97,3669.832,3670.666,Not seeing any questions here.,46,,
447,0.97,3670.666,3677.373,"So we'll move onto also I believe in your portfolio Robin, police reform, and public safety.",46,,
448,0.97,3677.373,3678.174,Indeed.,47,,
449,0.97,3678.174,3693.089,"So in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, and the protests that followed in the summer of 2020, the Legislature was very focused on policy to make statewide reforms to policing, and passed over 10 bills.",47,,
450,0.97,3693.089,3703.566,"The most significant of these included the oversight and accountability of peace officers and corrections officers, otherwise known as decertification.",47,,

455,0.97,3758.721,3767.73,The operating budget also provided $22 million for the establishment and operation of the office.,47,,
456,0.97,3767.73,3773.002,Another significant bill requirements for tactics and equipment used by law enforcement House bill 1054.,47,,
457,0.97,3773.002,3776.172,This bill does many different things around tactics.,47,,
458,0.97,3776.172,3781.677,It limits the use of Chokeholds and neck restraints.,47,,
459,0.97,3781.677,3786.449,Prohibits use of most military equipment.,47,,
460,0.97,3786.449,3789.685,Providesprovisions around when tear gas may be used.,47,,
461,0.97,3789.685,3792.288,"Firing on moving vehicles, and No-Knock warrants.",47,,
462,0.97,3792.288,3807.403,"It also requires the adoption of policies and procedures to ensure uniform police officers are identifiable, and requires the criminal justice training Commission, to adopt a model use of training on Canines.",47,,
463,0.97,3807.403,3817.88,"Also, there was a statewide reasonable care standard for use of force by law enforcement officers established by House bill 1310.",47,,
464,0.97,3817.88,3823.319,That was also offered by representative Johnson.,47,,
465,0.97,3823.319,3839.435,"Finally another significant view was the ability to intervene bill, which requires on duty law enforcement to intervene when excessive use of force by another law officer is witnessed, and also requires reporting of such wrongdoing reported by another officer.",47,,
466,0.97,3839.435,3848.811,"I will pause there before I move to public safety and the state versus Blake decision, which is another mouthful.",47,,
467,0.97,3848.811,3851.948,I'm not seeing any raised hands.,48,,
468,0.97,3851.948,3852.982,I do have one question.,48,,
469,0.97,3852.982,3879.542,"There was a bill that I know the community police Commission had some concerns about, because it wasn't clear whether or not it would preempt our own independent community based Oversite system and just wondering, was that contained in any of the bills that passed?",48,,
470,0.97,3879.542,3879.775,No.,49,,
471,0.97,3879.775,3880.176,That was not.,49,,
472,0.97,3880.176,3882.678,That bill did not make it this year.,49,,
473,0.97,3882.678,3903.599,"And I think that there was a commitment among the legislators that that would be something to be worked on in the interim, and I think we want to remain in that conversation in Seattle, that what is done is additive, and not in conflict with what we already have here in Seattle.",49,,
474,0.97,3903.599,3904.9,"Thank you, Robin.",50,,
475,0.97,3904.9,3906.636,One other question.,50,,
476,0.97,3906.636,3932.728,"Has there already sort of through your work in in staffing these various bills has there been an analysis as to what changes of Seattle city law, or Seattle police Department policy will be necessary now that these bills passed?",50,,
477,0.97,3932.728,3934.497,I don't think we've been in the now system.,51,,
478,0.97,3934.497,3946.108,"I will say many of the bills, I think, are kind of establishing a statewide standard for things that our Seattle police Department already does.",51,,
479,0.97,3946.108,3950.88,So I don't think that there will be very significant changes.,51,,
480,0.97,3950.88,3970.933,"It's possible that the police decertification bill will require tomorrow changes, and we certainly should look at all the other bills, but I do think that many of our policies that our Seattle police Department follows are kind of the standard that the rest of the state is catching up to.",51,,
481,0.97,3970.933,4000.596,"So for new requirements, such as an example, officer duty to intervene, is that sort of just for the state of Washington considered a new policy for all police officers that work within the state of Washington, or within expectation that if that policy is violated that local law enforcement departments take action?",52,,
482,0.97,4000.596,4007.87,What is sort of the enforcement side of a statewide policy like that?,52,,
483,0.97,4007.87,4032.661,"I think it differs from bill to bill, but as far as the duty intervene bill is, I believe the expectation of the sponsors of that bill and the Legislature is that every officer, every police Department around the state will adopt that standard as part of what they must do.",53,,
484,0.97,4032.661,4043.072,And I think there's also a bill that passed around a Audits.,53,,
485,0.97,4043.072,4056.819,"There was some thought put into how all of this would work together, and if there was a police Department not following what they were supposed to do.",53,,
486,0.97,4056.819,4061.824,This is a mechanism to follow there.,53,,
487,0.97,4061.824,4067.997,"Certainly, I think it's going to be interesting just to watch how this all plays out, because this is kind of new territory.",53,,
488,0.97,4067.997,4073.335,"The legislature taking up a space they haven't done so in the past, I think we'll all just have to sit back and wait.",53,,
489,0.97,4073.335,4097.626,"And you know, we may see some areas that may need some additional legislation next year, when it, the policies play out because of course sometimes in the rush of the legislative session, things get done very quickly and all of the consequences may not have been thought about as a result of the implication of the laws.",53,,
490,0.97,4097.626,4098.227,Thank you.,54,,
491,0.97,4098.227,4103.299,"Seeing no further questions, let's move onto public safety section.",54,,
492,0.97,4103.299,4128.724,"Well, I believe in our last briefing I talked about this state versus Blake decision that the Legislature was trying to figure out what to do in the wake of the state versus Blake decision that struck down the Washington felony possession of controlled substances even if a person was possessing controlled substances unknowingly.",55,,
493,0.97,4128.724,4137.5,And they did manage to come to an agreement by the end of the legislative session.,55,,
494,0.97,4137.5,4153.249,"And I would say that the thing that's most important to understand where the legislation was going with this, is they really envision people with substance abuse disorder.",55,,
495,0.97,4153.249,4166.529,"In lieu of legal system involvement at least twice when they encounter someone and they may, but are not required to make additional Furloughs.",55,,
496,0.97,4166.529,4190.819,"The bill addresses a recovery services plan that is drafted by a substantial use recovery committee that is also used in the bill, and the whole idea behind this is to ensure a statewide treatment based approach for people who have substance abuse disorder who come into contact with law enforcement, or become engaged with the criminal justice system.",55,,
497,0.97,4190.819,4198.994,"The bill does make knowingly possessing a controlled substance a misdemeanor with a sunset date of July 21st, 2023.",55,,
498,0.97,4198.994,4214.543,"By that time the committee will have Dramaticked their plan, and I think the assumption is something else will be done at the statewide level to Memorialize whatever the substance use recovery committee comes up with over the next two years.",55,,
499,0.97,4214.543,4239.902,"It was also something that's a little interesting is that, given the late timing of the negotiating compromise, the bill also makes $88.4 million in appropriations for recovery Navigated program, homeless outreach stabilization, and other programs and services that aren't actually included in the operating bill, because he just didn't have time to get them in there, given the late stage of negotiations.",55,,
500,0.97,4239.902,4255.751,"In addition, the operating bill does provide about $85 million to the courts, the office of public defense, the office of civil legal aid, and to address vacating and reducing Stetses, and to pay back obligations.",55,,
501,0.97,4255.751,4262.291,The full details of this are available on page 4 of the operating budget ceremony that we attached in our Email to you yesterday.,55,,
502,0.97,4262.291,4276.538,"So you can see all of the details of where all the money goes and the allocations from the Senate bill, which go to a number of different programs.",55,,
503,0.97,4276.538,4280.275,I also just wanted to highlight the open carry of weapons bill.,55,,
504,0.97,4280.275,4295.624,"A fairly significant piece of gun control legislation that passed, which prohibits open carry of weapons at permitted demonstrations and on the state Capitol campus.",55,,
505,0.97,4295.624,4305.0,"Finally, I know many of you are interested driving while a license is suspended.",55,,
506,0.97,4305.0,4312.207,It eliminates the suspension of a license as a penalty for traffic Infractions.,55,,
507,0.97,4312.207,4312.508,Full stop.,55,,
508,0.97,4312.508,4329.491,"Then it allows for a person to admit responsibility for an infraction in court, then it tests the inability to pay, and requires the information on how to prove that you are unable to pay, and how to obtain a payment plan to meet the traffic infraction.",55,,
509,0.97,4329.491,4343.072,"Of course with the idea of, you know, attempting to address the desperate impacts of having people's licenses suspend, and having to drive, get to work, et cetera, et cetera.",55,,
510,0.97,4343.072,4354.516,It does contain a provision that says the Department of licensing must suspend the license for 60 days with a one year Probational period.,55,,
511,0.97,4354.516,4374.903,"If a person commitments three or more Infractions in a year, or four or more in a two year period, in that case, the license must be retracted for 60 days.",55,,
512,0.97,4374.903,4382.578,So I'm happy to answer any questions on this section as well.,55,,
513,0.97,4382.578,4399.495,I just want to make a point of thanking chief Adrian Diaz for his advocacy on Senate bill 50-38 on the open carry of weapons.,56,,
514,0.97,4399.495,4405.501,Then also just a question around the license suspension bill.,56,,
515,0.97,4405.501,4422.351,"For the allowance for a licensed to be suspended if there are three more more traffic Infractions, is there, are all traffic Infractions treated equally under that scenario?",56,,
516,0.97,4422.351,4426.221,I think from a busted tail light to a Dui?,56,,
517,0.97,4426.221,4429.158,Are they all treated equally?,56,,
518,0.97,4429.158,4432.427,I believe they are.,57,,
519,0.97,4432.427,4436.398,"But I will Re-Read the legislation, and get back to you.",57,,
520,0.97,4436.398,4437.633,Thank you.,58,,
521,0.97,4437.633,4444.006,I'm just locking for any other questions.,58,,
522,0.97,4444.006,4444.506,From Councilmembers.,58,,
523,0.97,4444.506,4456.185,"Not seeing any, so we'll move onto the final section which is the safety net in civil rights, again going back.",58,,
524,0.97,4456.185,4456.418,Hanna.,58,,
525,0.97,4456.418,4456.785,Thank you.,59,,
526,0.97,4456.785,4470.532,A couple highlights here that all go along with some great budget news in the safety net area.,59,,
527,0.97,4470.532,4473.135,The Tanith bill.,59,,
528,0.97,4473.135,4490.652,"If people received a benefit after March1St of 2020, and then Washington's unemployment rate is at or above 7%, all families who received a Tanith grant since March of 2020 are eligible.",59,,
529,0.97,4490.652,4500.162,The final budget includes $52 million for a 15% increase in the cash assist grant.,59,,
530,0.97,4500.162,4503.932,And $27.2 million for that time limit extension.,59,,
531,0.97,4503.932,4517.646,"This means that the current monthly payment for a family of three will increase from $568, to $654.",59,,
532,0.97,4517.646,4520.616,Paid family leave.,59,,
533,0.97,4520.616,4530.626,"Representative Varyies House bill 10-73, expands the look back program for workers affected by Covid-19.",59,,
534,0.97,4530.626,4548.443,"It provides pandemic leave assistance, and employee grants for leave claims and provides grant eligibility for employees that do not immediate the threshold for hours worked in 2020, and through the first quarter of 2021.",59,,
535,0.97,4548.443,4557.92,"The final operating budget, Icluded $168.7 million for this implementation.",59,,

538,0.97,4566.061,4572.401,"While the maximum payment for workers with three or more children will be $1,200.",59,,
539,0.97,4572.401,4586.915,"The bill also issues that individuals with taxpayer numbers qualify to receive the benefit, and that includes $260.9 million in the final operating budget.",59,,
540,0.97,4586.915,4590.686,So those are the highlights in the safety net program as well.,59,,
541,0.97,4590.686,4593.155,"Thank you, Hanna.",60,,

596,0.97,4895.323,4905.3,"Thank you, president pro Tem Herbold, and thank you for your opening remarks in your President's report.",72,,
597,0.97,4905.3,4915.043,My thoughts and heartfelt condolences are with Lorena Gonzalez and her family for their horrible loss over the weekend.,72,,
598,0.97,4915.043,4923.385,I also want to reinforcement comments Councilmember Herbold made regarding chief Diaz's action.,72,,
599,0.97,4923.385,4932.861,Many of us were alarmed by the determination to overturn the police accountability for one of last summer's most serious incidents against protesters.,72,,
600,0.97,4932.861,4944.839,"While I believe we should support the good work of our police officers and work harder to retain our good officers here in Seattle, wherever police misconduct is confirmed, I believe SPD officials should be held accountable.",72,,
601,0.97,4944.839,4951.313,"In fact, by holding officers accountable, I Believewe build trust, and encourage good officers to stay.",72,,
602,0.97,4951.313,4961.623,"The people of Seattle have a right to March, and I join several of those, and to protest the injustice to George Floyd, and the generations of black and Brown Americans.",72,,
603,0.97,4961.623,4974.369,"Many of my constituents and I condemned last summer, the misguided use by SPD of tear gas against constitutionally protected protests.",72,,
604,0.97,4974.369,4989.851,"After looking further into this incident, I agree with our community bliss Commission, which said last week on May 12, we are concerned by chief Diaz's decision to overturn the office of police accountability findings in this case.",72,,
605,0.97,4989.851,4998.159,The justice denied peaceful protesters and the harm this will do to trust in the Seattle police Department and Seattle's entire police accountability system.,72,,
606,0.97,4998.159,5009.537,"I did connect directly with chief Diaz to express my concerns, and as Councilmember Herbold indicated, he is apparently pursuing others to hold accountability.",72,,
607,0.97,5009.537,5017.379,He did not agree with blaming that lower ranking officer.,72,,
608,0.97,5017.379,5027.555,I encourage the chief to complete this Exppee Dishesly.,72,,
609,0.97,5027.555,5037.999,"After this incident is resolved, and we finally have accountability, I believe City Hall should continue to double down on the hard work of revamping the expired police contract.",72,,
610,0.97,5037.999,5048.91,"Revamping that contract, which I believe is unjust, and flexible, and expensive.",72,,

904,0.97,7679.171,7704.997,"We're asking folks to log on 15 minutes early so you can go ahead and set up your device to show the interpretation tools, and be able to access the listen in line for the presentation to be translated simultaneously for Councilmembers who speak English as a first language, and for any of the viewing public who also wants to be able to get access to translation services simultaneously.",86,,

910,0.97,7738.23,7745.037,"English and Spanish, and you need to choose one of those to be able to listen to that language, otherwise you won't hear anything.",86,,
911,0.97,7745.037,7754.179,"But the line kind of goes to a soft mute, and that way the translation can occur over the person speaking so that it's audible, the language that you're choosing.",86,,
912,0.97,7754.179,7765.591,"If you do have any comments and questions during the presentation, which we encourage you to write those down, because we're asking you to hold those until the end of the presentation, and save them.",86,,
913,0.97,7765.591,7777.503,"Make sure to speak slowly, so that the interpreter can catch what you're saying, and stay away from using Acronyms and jargon.",86,,
914,0.97,7777.503,7784.009,"This is appreciated as well, but also very difficult in translation purposes.",86,,

964,0.97,8215.14,8222.38,Just an update on a potential amendments to the bill.,87,,
965,0.97,8222.38,8224.616,And with that.,87,,
966,0.97,8224.616,8231.957,I will move into my report.,87,,
967,0.97,8231.957,8236.461,I'll just get myself in the note on my items here.,87,,
968,0.97,8236.461,8238.763,No comments from the public and human services committee.,87,,
969,0.97,8238.763,8244.703,There were two bills that moved out of committee and were sent to the full Council on the 21st.,87,,
970,0.97,8244.703,8260.018,"The first bill would transfer 911 call center positions and parking enforcement office positions from the Seattle police Department to the community safety and communications center, as was laid out in ordinance 126233.",87,,
971,0.97,8260.018,8263.922,That Council passed unanimously during the budget process.,87,,
972,0.97,8263.922,8281.64,"I am considering bringing forward an amendment to that latter bill, that would allow us to pass the transfer of the 911 call center positions on the 24th and hold the parking enforcement officer positions until a later date.",87,,
973,0.97,8281.64,8287.279,And there is some time sensitivity around this without taking some action by June 1ST.,87,,
974,0.97,8287.279,8297.088,We need to take action by June 1ST in order to allow the folks holding these positions to be paid.,87,,
975,0.97,8297.088,8331.69,"So considering that there is a change of heart on the behalf of some Councilmembers on the transfer of the PEO positions I think it might be wise to have an ongoing discussion about that as was suggested by Councilmember Lewis, and make a change that will allow us to do so without negatively Impacting the payment of the folks in those positions.",87,,
976,0.97,8331.69,8336.394,There is no public safety and human services committee this week.,87,,
977,0.97,8336.394,8349.708,I want to make a point ever adjusting some issues related to an ongoing issue in district 1. specifically in the South Delridge neighborhood.,87,,
978,0.97,8349.708,8391.75,"Really want to appreciate and acknowledge the efforts to address concerns related to an outdoor encampment on Delridge way, Southwest just north of Roxbury, over the last several months, beginning in Mid- to late February I've been hearing from concerned residents, business owners, and workers in the area and I've been working to advocate for additional resources and actions to address the safety clean up, and obstruction concerns of neighbors there, as well as the survival, and shelter needs of residents.",87,,
979,0.97,8391.75,8413.171,"In response to queries, the Seattle public utilities began weekly trash collection confers to the encampment in early March and worked to have outreach workers with reach to visit residents there to assess the impacts and understand the needs of the residents better and provide services.",87,,
980,0.97,8413.171,8422.614,"Before I talk a little about the reach engagement, want to really thank the business owners in the area.",87,,
981,0.97,8422.614,8430.655,Many of them have been providing meals on an ongoing basis to folks in the encampment.,87,,
982,0.97,8430.655,8453.411,"The owner of the Triangle tavern has been both providing Sharps collection containers at his own expense as well as contracting with Waste management for additional garbage pick up, because the weekly trash collection services provided by Seattle public utilities was not sufficient.",87,,
983,0.97,8453.411,8475.2,"I heard from reach outreach workers a couple weeks ago, or maybe a couple weeks ago, Yeah, I think it was a couple weeks ago, in hearing the difficulty that they were having Accessing safe shelter and housing referrals.",87,,
984,0.97,8475.2,8485.21,And in terms to any successful camera location as we know is the access to alternatives.,87,,
985,0.97,8485.21,8516.441,And reach out reach workers that are part of the hope team deployment explained that the Úproblem that they were continuing to run in at this location is a lack of services shelter and options across the board as well as a lack of transparency and access to options allowed by the city.,87,,
986,0.97,8516.441,8521.079,They have made many referrals for vulnerable folks at this particular location.,87,,
987,0.97,8521.079,8539.464,"However, they did not hear back from the city and they did not see the referrals going towards other priority areas regardless of the needs or Vulnerabilities of those living in that site.",87,,
988,0.97,8539.464,8548.506,So the efforts of code lead began a couple weeks ago now.,87,,
989,0.97,8548.506,8572.263,"And it's both Fortuitous that the site manager, I'm sorry, the Prolead lives in the area, and I also reached out to him with my concern from the city contracted outreach services, their difficulty in Accessing the housing alternative.",87,,
990,0.97,8572.263,8575.633,And Colead started visiting the site.,87,,
991,0.97,8575.633,8600.024,"They partnered with a number of different other service providers and between the work that they were doing, it looks like in that particular location 100% of the encampment residents have accepted referral.",87,,
992,0.97,8600.024,8613.204,That's because housing access that is simply just more flexible than the resources that the city contracted outreach providers have available.,87,,
993,0.97,8613.204,8621.746,So it's really important to highlight this example of the importance of those safe shelter referrals.,87,,
994,0.97,8621.746,8631.122,"In this case, city departments and outreach workers have been aware of and engaging for months.",87,,
995,0.97,8631.122,8650.208,"I really appreciate their efforts to problem solve with the community members, but the experience of bringing in Colead with its safe shelter resources really shows how essential their engagement is in locations like this.",87,,
996,0.97,8650.208,8651.442,On my Telehealth update.,87,,
997,0.97,8651.442,8663.521,"I want to uplift that FAS and its partners provided nearly 8,500 Vaccinations at lumen field on Saturday.",87,,

1011,0.97,8742.867,8749.14,Many providers are providing vaccination on a walk up basis.,87,,
1012,0.97,8749.14,8752.91,You can get your second shot close to home.,87,,
