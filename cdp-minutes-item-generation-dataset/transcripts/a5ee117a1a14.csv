28,0.97,98.465,119.853,"It remains a strong intent of the Council to have public comment regularly included on meeting Agendas, however, the city council does reserve the right to end or eliminate public comment periods at any point if we deem this system is being abused or is unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently in a manner in which we are able to conduct our necessary business.",14,,

41,0.97,210.81,216.616,"So the public comment period is now open, and we will begin with the first Speaker on the list.",14,,
42,0.97,216.616,230.663,Please remember to press Star six before speaking.,14,,
43,0.97,230.663,231.164,And hold please.,14,,

45,0.97,237.67,240.54,"Jarrell, it is your turn to speak.",14,,
46,0.97,240.54,242.775,"Hello, my name is Jarrell Davis.",15,,
47,0.97,242.775,246.479,I want to speak on the permanent EI board structure.,15,,
48,0.97,246.479,263.596,"I really want to encourage Council to support the race and equity task force decision around how many members are coming from the Mayor's office, how many members are coming from the Council, and how many members are appointed by community members.",15,,
49,0.97,263.596,274.073,Since 2016 the race and equity task force have been the expertise on the race and equity standard related to equitable development.,15,,
50,0.97,274.073,283.65,"By developing the comprehensive plan by developing the gross strategy as well as the Edi implementation plan, race and equity task force have led this.",15,,
51,0.97,283.65,302.135,The Mayor's idea of collaboration or partnership with communities is obviously skewed and dispersed if the Mayor thinks it is appropriate for her to be able to appoint the majority of seats on a Community-Driven board.,15,,
52,0.97,302.135,311.144,"Since 2018 our board has demanded a permanent board for the Edi and have been met with nothing, but opposition.",15,,
53,0.97,311.144,322.355,It would completely undermine the fact that this is suppose to be a community driven board if the Mayor is able to have the majority of seats.,15,,
54,0.97,322.355,326.025,Our Mayor will receive the Max and that is quite generous.,15,,
55,0.97,326.025,335.768,The Council will get three and then the board will identify seven folks up to 13 persons proposed seats.,15,,
56,0.97,335.768,348.648,"It will completely undermine the fact that over the last five and four years the neighborhood specifically that they are representing, there has been a large amount of black, Brown, and low income folks that have been displaced.",15,,
57,0.97,348.648,357.59,The fact we can try to emphasize equitable development and these neighborhoods yet it continues to get pushed to the back Burner.,15,,
58,0.97,357.59,376.409,"I think contributes to the fact the issues have continued in these neighborhoods, and so I urge the Council to support the race and equity task force suggestion of the breakdown of how the seats are allowed for a permanent Edi structure.",15,,
59,0.97,376.409,376.809,Thank you.,15,,
60,0.97,376.809,382.115,"Thank you, Jarrell.",16,,
61,0.97,382.115,384.851,The next Speaker is Julia Brosciutto.,16,,

67,0.97,405.204,427.66,"As Jarrell said since 2018 the Edi advisory board and the task force have been advocating for a permanent Edi advisory board that retains the community Self- determination, principles, outlined in the equitable development implementation plan that the city adopted in 2016.",17,,
68,0.97,427.66,438.671,"The interim board has played a critical role in the Rollout of the most acclaimed Anti- displacement strategy, the equitable development initiative.",17,,
69,0.97,438.671,442.041,We have developed community accountability.,17,,
70,0.97,442.041,449.415,And has resulted in over $21 million awarded to black indigenous people of color.,17,,
71,0.97,449.415,457.39,"We call on you, the Council, to amend the Edi advisory board legislation.",17,,
72,0.97,457.39,468.668,We need an advisory board that is representative of the community seeking displacement and have used expertise in what their communities need.,17,,
73,0.97,468.668,474.774,"We call for a board, a 13- person board member, three of whom would be appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by Council.",17,,
74,0.97,474.774,482.548,"Three of whom would be appointed by Council, and seven would be appointed by the Advisory board itself.",17,,
75,0.97,482.548,499.899,"As I said earlier, it is equitable development initiative, all about Self- determination and the communities impacted by displacement needs to be at the forefront of the decision making and you have the opportunity to make that happen.",17,,
76,0.97,499.899,503.436,Thank you.,17,,
77,0.97,503.436,504.07,"Thank you, Julia.",18,,

79,0.97,510.009,512.044,"Evelyn, it is your turn.",18,,
80,0.97,512.044,515.715,Please make sure you press Star six.,18,,

87,0.97,557.723,567.733,"The purpose of our board is to view identified projects, resources, and voice for those communities that have been historically excluded.",19,,
88,0.97,567.733,576.175,We join with others and all of the comments have gone on before us.,19,,
89,0.97,576.175,584.216,The permanent Edi board should reflect its original purpose to be community driven.,19,,
90,0.97,584.216,596.062,"Support the structure as outlined in September 11, 2020 letter to the city council's community economic development committee from the organization.",19,,
91,0.97,596.062,610.042,It is our hope that the Mayor and the city council uphold their stated commitment to honor the voice of those ethnic communities that have historically been targeted to be kept silent.,19,,
92,0.97,610.042,624.457,"We call for the establishment of the permanent Edi board with the majority membership from the community from which it is disturbed, thank you.",19,,

103,0.97,694.794,714.046,"So I want to go ahead and proceed, but begin the conversation with that and happy to hear from colleagues as we move forward with any questions that you may have for the folks who are here and for the city staff who are here as well.",20,,

150,0.97,993.459,1002.401,"I want to go ahead and turn it over to her, so she could give you a little more of a background about herself and why she wants to be a Commissioner and things like that.",40,,
151,0.97,1002.401,1003.635,"Go right ahead, Marcia.",40,,

153,0.97,1010.142,1013.846,"It's Ukrainian, it is Marcia Wright-Soika for the record.",41,,
154,0.97,1013.846,1016.148,I'm really pleased to be here.,41,,
155,0.97,1016.148,1022.054,I've been working with the Commission now for several months unofficially.,41,,
156,0.97,1022.054,1028.36,"But I'm very, very excited about the caliber of the commissioners that I have been working with.",41,,
157,0.97,1028.36,1033.499,"Just really, really pleased to be nominated.",41,,
158,0.97,1033.499,1041.507,"Marcia, can you tell us, I was, I am a former human rights Commissioner myself as is Council member Lewis.",42,,
159,0.97,1041.507,1044.977,"Have been through this process, I know it could take some time.",42,,
160,0.97,1044.977,1063.128,"I know there are several vacancies, although it seems like the women's Commission is more--is full compared to some of the others, but can you talk a little bit about some of the priorities for the women's Commission and what your particular interest is?",42,,
161,0.97,1063.128,1063.395,Sure.,43,,
162,0.97,1063.395,1068.6,So I moved here a few years ago from the East Coast.,43,,
163,0.97,1068.6,1075.607,"When I was joining the Seattle community, I really wanted to find a way to utilize my background to give back.",43,,
164,0.97,1075.607,1084.55,And so I have a history of working with women's rights and women's equality organizations all over the country.,43,,
165,0.97,1084.55,1088.187,So I was very excited to hear about the women's Commission and they were searching for members.,43,,
166,0.97,1088.187,1096.695,Part of the reason why I was interested in the Commission was because of the recent Eviction report that they had released.,43,,
167,0.97,1096.695,1103.869,Up until recently I was working in affordable housing in Seattle.,43,,
168,0.97,1103.869,1114.346,"We desperately need voices on the Commission that can focus a general lens on the affordable housing issue, and that has been a critical part of our work and our priorities.",43,,
169,0.97,1114.346,1121.353,The other thing I would say is we have really been taking a look at equitable development as a whole.,43,,
170,0.97,1121.353,1124.957,It's one of our priority focus areas.,43,,
171,0.97,1124.957,1134.133,Within that we are looking at everything from the disproportionate impact of fair enforcement on the people that transit and so close to serve.,43,,
172,0.97,1134.133,1152.251,We are looking at housing policies and how we can expand opportunities for affordable housing for those who identify as women who are disproportionately impacted by economic hardship here in our city.,43,,
173,0.97,1152.251,1184.316,"And another thing I would say is that the Coronavirus pandemic has given sort of new urgency to our committee because as we start to seek the recovery that is desperately needed by those who identify as women and their families throughout this city, it is important that we have a voice of commissioners who are looking to ensure that recovery period is equitable and goes to those who have faced the most harm economic and health wise during the pandemic.",43,,
174,0.97,1184.316,1193.458,So I think it has given us a new urgency and renewed energy.,43,,

214,0.97,1466.464,1476.775,"I am excited to be able to lend a voice to how that affects our front line Healthcare workers, which are majority female.",56,,

247,0.97,1704.135,1709.34,I don't have to explain to you why I want to be a part of this Commission.,66,,
248,0.97,1709.34,1714.145,It's an incredible diverse exciting group of women who want to contribute to our community.,66,,
249,0.97,1714.145,1723.121,"A little background on me, I'm not a local or not a native Washingtonian, I went to school out here in Tacoma, and then after that just stayed.",66,,
250,0.97,1723.121,1734.065,"I ended up working for one of our members of Congress for about nine years here, and then last June decided to come home to work for Fred Hutch.",66,,
251,0.97,1734.065,1740.672,So I currently serve as the community relations manager at the Fred Hutch cancer research center.,66,,
252,0.97,1740.672,1744.843,With that I'm sort of a civic ambassador to the community.,66,,

266,0.97,1832.13,1848.279,And because of her previous Úwork her interest in applying to the women's Commission arises from the fact she has the experience of working with an Intersectional approach to racial justice and understands how it differs from superficial diversity and inclusion rhetoric.,67,,
267,0.97,1848.279,1849.981,Yadira has a B.A.,67,,

436,0.97,2869.666,2895.692,"I have--as Randy mentioned, I think the work I do with the organization that I run path of art is particularly useful because we represent, we represent the next of social impact and social justice and the arts representing very Underserved communities who typically don't have access to the arts, but have a lot to gain.",130,,
437,0.97,2895.692,2900.03,We believe our community has a lot to gain from lifting up the voices as well.,130,,
438,0.97,2900.03,2902.032,So a little bit about path of art.,130,,
439,0.97,2902.032,2905.469,"Path of art is an arts organization, it started in 2008.",130,,
440,0.97,2905.469,2912.943,And I came on board as the executive director seven years ago in 2013.,130,,

442,0.97,2922.319,2936.767,And so as a way to help people heal from that trauma and also give them some agency and voice and dignity.,130,,
443,0.97,2936.767,2937.668,And less in visibility.,130,,
444,0.97,2937.668,2957.087,"And our participants have come to us from all walks of life, but in addition to helping individuals heal through the arts, we also believe what we found in the last seven years is we have a role to play in helping our community heal through the arts.",130,,
445,0.97,2957.087,2958.689,We're extremely fractured as a community.,130,,
446,0.97,2958.689,2971.301,"I believe strongly and a part of the rule is in healing the divides and fostering more empathy, which I think we could probably all agree is needed now more than ever.",130,,
447,0.97,2971.301,2974.604,So that's the work.,130,,

449,0.97,2979.91,2999.696,"We work with, like I said, just mostly people from about 45 social service agencies who either residential or communities like Theatric agencies, and provide arts engagement for those folks doing workshops like we do at the King County diversion court, etc.",130,,
450,0.97,2999.696,3030.36,"So I believe my role on the Commission is to make sure those voices are represented number one, and as Randy also mentioned I'm very passionate--I have an agenda in the arts and community recovery in general outside path of art because I really think the arts are not a nice to have, but essential to a community's well being.",130,,
451,0.97,3030.36,3043.774,My background on social justice and democracy work and exposure to art has led me to believe art is really a great.,130,,

453,0.97,3045.575,3053.55,"That's great, thank you, I appreciate that, Holly.",131,,
454,0.97,3053.55,3053.75,Okay.,131,,

645,0.97,4234.163,4260.689,"The purpose of the Edi advisory board is to guide the implementation of the Edi program and also to ensure the program for the city's justice initiative, among other things, some of the key work of the board includes implementing the accountability goals of the Edi implementation plan.",178,,
646,0.97,4260.689,4264.426,We will talk about that briefly.,178,,
647,0.97,4264.426,4274.103,Develop the funding criteria for the fund working with city staff and Council.,178,,
648,0.97,4274.103,4281.844,"And also develops recommendations, each year when we have requested proposals for the Edi Fund.",178,,
649,0.97,4281.844,4299.461,"To date as you saw the Advisory board, they have been extremely effective and helpful and literally getting this program off the ground in supporting and guiding that program as a new initiative in the city since 2016.",178,,
650,0.97,4299.461,4302.831,I too would like to thank their tireless work.,178,,
651,0.97,4302.831,4309.638,"It's many, many hours each month and then especially during funding reviews.",178,,
652,0.97,4309.638,4316.345,They review hundreds and hundreds of documents and pages to come up with a list of recommendations.,178,,
653,0.97,4316.345,4318.18,It's not an easy task.,178,,
654,0.97,4318.18,4324.553,So I just want to say thank you for their work.,178,,
655,0.97,4324.553,4332.261,Now I just want to introduce someone who doesn't need any introduction.,178,,
656,0.97,4332.261,4351.58,"The development manager and my boss Ubax Gardheere, to give you an overview of the Edi program in general just to give you a background on what set this decision you are making today in the context of the large very important program that the city has.",178,,
657,0.97,4351.58,4354.283,"So with that Ubax, can you give a quick overview?",178,,
658,0.97,4354.283,4354.883,Thank you.,179,,
659,0.97,4354.883,4370.265,I'm going to focus on an overview of the ordinance and hopefully you can get a little bit more of an overview of the Edi and the fund later on if we have time.,179,,
660,0.97,4370.265,4377.573,"And as Lish stated, the ordinance, excuse me.",179,,
661,0.97,4377.573,4378.741,I'm normally not like this.,179,,
662,0.97,4378.741,4399.361,So in the end of 2017 Council adopted an ordinance which required Opcd to submit a resolution to formally create Edi structure.,179,,
663,0.97,4399.361,4412.574,"Working with the interim advisory board and law, it became clear a resolution would not be sufficient to meet the called objectives, so we ended up with an ordinance.",179,,
664,0.97,4412.574,4431.96,"The membership like Lish mentioned for the ordinance we are presenting right now creates 13 members, eight appointed by executive, five appointed by the board, and all appointments co-founded by city council.",179,,
665,0.97,4431.96,4440.135,And we have worked excessively with the law to advance potential legal barriers to avoid appointment process.,179,,
666,0.97,4440.135,4456.685,And the demonstration requires the board to adopt bylaws that will provide transparency and accountability in the selection process and to ensure the needs of the impacted communities represented.,179,,
667,0.97,4456.685,4475.804,The interim advisory board have also recommended the exact process for selecting the appointment seats be kept flexible to allow the Edi to develop the best practices that will be useful for increasing the representation on the board.,179,,
668,0.97,4475.804,4498.961,The legislation will also provide guidance on the membership criteria and intended to ensure the presentation from the communities most impacted by growth and development and displacement as well as acknowledge the multiple identities and perspectives that are critical to a successful functioning advisory board.,179,,
669,0.97,4498.961,4514.343,"As far as conversations, the board also represents including structure for participants making sure we are meeting folks for their expertise and their time.",179,,
670,0.97,4514.343,4524.686,Community Stakeholders have been consistent over asking us the city needs to compensate folks for further expertise.,179,,
671,0.97,4524.686,4534.096,And the number that represents a balanced approach between these options and meets the needs of community members.,179,,
672,0.97,4534.096,4543.805,"A section they call for, there's a lot of other different programs that also conversation the community members Hey're engaging.",179,,
673,0.97,4543.805,4552.748,We wanted to make sure there is also a consistent there.,179,,
674,0.97,4552.748,4558.287,"As far as approval, an approval process.",179,,
675,0.97,4558.287,4562.357,"Sorry, I'm not feeling well today.",179,,
676,0.97,4562.357,4569.998,"Again, 13 members position 1-8 will be appointed by the Mayor and confound by city council.",179,,
677,0.97,4569.998,4576.204,"Positions 9-13, appointed by the board and confirmed by city council.",179,,
678,0.97,4576.204,4590.686,"And then also initial members for three, nine, six, 12, 13 should be members of the equitable initiative interim advisory board, so we have consistency and history there.",179,,
679,0.97,4590.686,4596.525,"So Yeah again, the criteria is a useful criteria.",179,,
680,0.97,4596.525,4626.121,Kind of calls out recommendations from the graphic locations among opportunities and even with--even recommendations ensuring they align with this membership criteria and looking at geographic neighborhoods that have experienced significant displacement as well as histories of discriminate policies and practices.,179,,
681,0.97,4626.121,4634.062,We are looking for a membership criteria that will have the lead experience being targeted by the policies and the practices.,179,,
682,0.97,4634.062,4642.07,"I'm going to leave it at that and talk about that and their composition and the appointment process, and the membership.",179,,
683,0.97,4642.07,4652.614,And if you have any questions.,179,,
684,0.97,4653.448,4654.049,Very good.,180,,
685,0.97,4654.049,4654.249,Okay.,180,,
686,0.97,4654.249,4656.685,Thank you.,180,,
687,0.97,4656.685,4657.986,I appreciate that and Lish.,180,,
688,0.97,4657.986,4673.668,"I think colleagues, what I would like to do is go ahead and ask our community members who are here to speak and then open it up for questions for the entire panel.",180,,
689,0.97,4673.668,4676.271,And shall I begin with you?,180,,
690,0.97,4676.271,4677.105,Yes.,181,,
691,0.97,4677.105,4684.212,I'm going to start and do you want me to introduce the rest?,181,,
692,0.97,4684.212,4686.081,Yes.,182,,
693,0.97,4686.081,4686.348,Okay.,183,,
694,0.97,4686.348,4689.985,"Yes, council member Morales, good afternoon, my name is AB Juaner.",183,,
695,0.97,4689.985,4694.122,I'm the equitable development manager at Puget sound Sage.,183,,
696,0.97,4694.122,4703.331,"You heard from my colleague earlier, who sits in the interim advisory board and recent social equity task force.",183,,
697,0.97,4703.331,4710.672,Puget sound Sage has been fighting for community control development in Seattle and King County.,183,,
698,0.97,4710.672,4721.016,We do this coalition of work with South board and the race and social equity task force.,183,,
699,0.97,4721.016,4728.857,We have been advocating for ownership of development in order to build resiliency in our committees.,183,,
700,0.97,4728.857,4737.466,We see again the Advisory board as one of the ways we can support the leadership and build the capacity of the black initiative.,183,,
701,0.97,4737.466,4742.137,People of colors and low income communities.,183,,
702,0.97,4742.137,4746.742,These have been historically excluded in decisions about how their communities develop.,183,,
703,0.97,4746.742,4759.521,So the Advisory board is an opportunity to let the community priorities engaged in Thesedecisions that have long- term significant impacts in their lives.,183,,
704,0.97,4759.521,4768.33,It has always been about community self-determination and other community developed areas.,183,,
705,0.97,4768.33,4777.506,We see the model is suppose to be Self-Serving community reach project.,183,,
706,0.97,4777.506,4786.181,This work is bringing an exception to make the city more equitable in its allocation of resources.,183,,
707,0.97,4786.181,4792.821,So we cannot take out the community dig making Seases.,183,,
708,0.97,4792.821,4799.227,That's what made it important as we need to have the right people on the board.,183,,
709,0.97,4799.227,4805.333,I am joined here today by committee Peters who served in the interim advisory board.,183,,
710,0.97,4805.333,4822.25,"Members of race and social equity task force, and equitable development initiative, who can speak more about the importance of having people serve in the permanent Edi advisory board.",183,,
711,0.97,4822.25,4825.353,"So we have Yordanos Teferi, Cesar Garcia, and Davis.",183,,
712,0.97,4825.353,4834.629,I'm going to turn it over to your office.,183,,
713,0.97,4834.629,4835.697,Thank you.,184,,
714,0.97,4835.697,4836.364,"Before you begin, sorry.",184,,
715,0.97,4836.364,4849.044,"Yeah, before you begin, I want to make sure for those of you who might be using a Headset or microphone, please make sure you're speaking into the microphone, because it's a little hard to hear if things are shifting around, thank you, please continue.",184,,
716,0.97,4849.044,4850.078,Thank you.,185,,
717,0.97,4850.078,4852.447,And let me know if you cannot hear me.,185,,
718,0.97,4852.447,4860.055,As I was saying I'm with the Multicultural community coalition.,185,,
719,0.97,4860.055,4875.003,"In addition to Mcing, being in the Edi mission, I also serve on the intermission advisory board as well as being recent equity task force member.",185,,
720,0.97,4875.003,4884.813,"As you heard from many of my colleagues, this really does come down to community Self- determination as you've heard.",185,,
721,0.97,4884.813,4891.62,The interim advisory board has been leading this work since 2016 quite effectively I might add.,185,,
722,0.97,4891.62,4898.56,And now to the point where we are asking for this to become a permanent advisory board.,185,,
723,0.97,4898.56,4904.666,We cannot have that community control taken away.,185,,
724,0.97,4904.666,4914.943,That's just essential to this work and that is just essential to the community determining the priorities within these equitable development projects and activities.,185,,
725,0.97,4914.943,4928.99,"The one thing I want to highlight is the fact that during this time of Covid and the resulting recession, we have seen the impact on Underserved and marginalized communities.",185,,
726,0.97,4928.99,4932.093,So we recommend that with the permanent Edi board.,185,,
727,0.97,4932.093,4943.838,There's going to be a need to deepen those resources and the infrastructure of that board to attend to these impacts.,185,,
728,0.97,4943.838,4957.385,"And so that is, again, where the community will need to come in to make certain those words go appropriately to the community based project and activities.",185,,
729,0.97,4957.385,4964.326,I will pause there and allow one of my other colleagues to weigh in.,185,,
730,0.97,4964.993,4970.231,"All right, Hi you guys.",186,,
731,0.97,4970.231,4974.336,I'm a committee Organizer with Africa town committee land trust.,186,,
732,0.97,4974.336,4981.109,"Key contributor for King County equity now, and also a producer for converge media.",186,,
733,0.97,4981.109,4992.22,"And in a lot of my roles as I just laid out there, we understand the need for community voice is super super needed right now.",186,,
734,0.97,4992.22,5000.495,It's some of the most Impactful ways that community members can be a part of the process.,186,,
735,0.97,5000.495,5005.033,And clearly Edi is a representative of that process.,186,,
736,0.97,5005.033,5044.372,"It is important that community members as they both pointed out now that community members be a part of the decision making that happens in their communities specifically with regards to development as we know historically groups of Olor in particular black people and Brown folks have really been left out of the development decisions that impact their Communitis so heavily that we see large, large numbers of Displaitments happening.",186,,
737,0.97,5044.372,5058.453,"It is simply because there wasn't a process to come into the communities unchecked, unchallenged, unequivocally as they came in with their power, their money, and we would see how it negatively impacts communities.",186,,
738,0.97,5058.453,5067.162,And there are some benefits in terms of maintenance of areas and space and as the divestment kind of happened.,186,,
739,0.97,5067.162,5070.198,Now we see this reinvestment.,186,,
740,0.97,5070.198,5075.203,But we need Edi to stay strong for community members who have been left out of this process.,186,,
741,0.97,5075.203,5093.021,"And I think it will be crucially imperative that the Edi board really be represented of community and be a voice, an extended voice of these people power that folks are connected to in Community-Based work.",186,,
742,0.97,5093.021,5103.031,So with that I will pass it on over to my colleague Cesar.,186,,
743,0.97,5103.031,5112.74,"Good afternoon, Madam chair and Council member Morales, and members of the committee.",187,,
744,0.97,5112.74,5113.341,I'm here today representing.,187,,
745,0.97,5113.341,5127.755,"We are a group on the Edi Grantee and we are actually the first group that have been funded by the Edi in North Seattle, in the entire North Seattle.",187,,
746,0.97,5127.755,5136.03,"And we are a small group, but very active and powerful in our community.",187,,
747,0.97,5136.03,5152.547,"We are a Multi-Cultural group with eight core members, representing the communities like the native Americans, Middle Eastern, South Asian, Asian, and Latino communities.",187,,
748,0.97,5152.547,5157.585,"We have served, we are serving around 800 people.",187,,
749,0.97,5157.585,5167.395,And we wouldn't be able to serve all these people in this area if not been by the Edi grant.,187,,
750,0.97,5167.395,5175.57,In fact I'm right here at this location that has been funded and paid by the Edi.,187,,
751,0.97,5175.57,5178.006,This is the gathering space.,187,,
752,0.97,5178.006,5187.348,"You can see here, you can see Ow we have a mask we are distributing before Covid-19.",187,,
753,0.97,5187.348,5192.921,"We had many meetings here, for example, for the inner voice your choice program.",187,,
754,0.97,5192.921,5202.263,And you can see horses in the middle because we are running a youth program right now for kids in our area.,187,,
755,0.97,5202.263,5209.637,And also thanks to the Seattle public library because a council member mentioned the libraries have been closed.,187,,
756,0.97,5209.637,5218.112,"So we have been a replacement of the services that the city could have been providing, but we are providing and distributing books for the community right now.",187,,
757,0.97,5218.112,5231.526,So this is just an example how a small group in the very northeast corner of the city will help with this advisory board.,187,,
758,0.97,5231.526,5255.283,"Of course, we are in support of a permanent advisory board because not only will that bring a more diversity board, but it will also increase representation, but also understanding of area corner of our city.",187,,
759,0.97,5255.283,5265.26,"Displacement is happening very badly in the downtown, Chinatown, and the South and the central district, but it is moving to other areas.",187,,
760,0.97,5265.26,5282.176,"As you know, if you just look at the Edi implementation plan and even the document called Seattle 2035, you will see how the displacement risk is affecting other areas.",187,,
761,0.97,5282.176,5288.416,So the permanent board will actually help with that.,187,,
762,0.97,5288.416,5292.32,Thank you so much.,187,,
763,0.97,5292.32,5294.055,"Thank you, very great.",188,,
764,0.97,5294.055,5294.355,Mr. Davis?,188,,
765,0.97,5294.355,5295.523,Are you on deck?,188,,
766,0.97,5295.523,5298.459,"Yes, I'm tail at the plate right now.",189,,
767,0.97,5298.459,5303.231,"Respect to you . body, much my name is Gregory Davis.",189,,
768,0.97,5303.231,5307.702,I'm at managing strategist for Rainier Beach active coalition.,189,,
769,0.97,5307.702,5321.049,"We store the Rainier Beach neighborhood plan, which essentially has us in partnership with the city, the city Department as they take their gaze at what is going on with Rainier Beach.",189,,
770,0.97,5321.049,5336.03,"We are also a part of education, the equitable development interim advisory board, Edi member, and also work with King County on this community on opportunities.",189,,
771,0.97,5336.03,5346.474,"I do want to say to each of you Council members, I just would really like to ask you to give your staff our warmest regards.",189,,
772,0.97,5346.474,5348.643,We know your staff works hard.,189,,
773,0.97,5348.643,5362.09,"They push lots of paper, get lots of calls, so we really want you to extend our appreciation to them for the work they do on your behalf and on the behalf of the city.",189,,
774,0.97,5362.09,5368.93,So naturally here to support the permanent equitable development advisory board.,189,,
775,0.97,5368.93,5379.307,"I have a couple of points that I want to share, you know, just based on some thinking about this and some experience.",189,,
776,0.97,5379.307,5404.632,"In fact supporting the permanent advisory board, we are actually in lock step with our set and the letter that you would have gotten where you would have received where we are actually looking at wanting to flip using the assignment authority from the Mayor's office having five and the community having five.",189,,
777,0.97,5404.632,5414.275,"We see it given the Mayor's office three given city council members three, and let the existing advisory board have seven.",189,,
778,0.97,5414.275,5425.086,"And this is something that we are seeing in current events, where you know, we really are learning more and more about the fact the community knows, okay.",189,,
779,0.97,5425.086,5429.991,We have been thinking about this since 2018.,189,,
780,0.97,5429.991,5434.162,We have been thinking about it for a long time.,189,,
781,0.97,5434.162,5439.333,And that thought has brought us to this point of making these recommendations.,189,,
782,0.97,5439.333,5452.213,"So it is not something that just kind of came up in this movement, this time of social unrest of Covid and all of that, it's been on our minds for a long time, so we want some consideration given for that.",189,,
783,0.97,5452.213,5462.056,"Speaking of consideration, you know, one of the interesting things we often have to experience as a community is, you know, we are considered reputable when it suits people.",189,,
784,0.97,5462.056,5482.743,"If we are reputable in any instance, we should be reputable until proven otherwise as a baseline, so we want you to consider this position, our position as an idea of where the consideration, because it is coming from reputable organizations.",189,,
785,0.97,5482.743,5490.818,And on groups like this in the past specifically the priority hire advisory board committee.,189,,
786,0.97,5490.818,5502.163,I have experienced when we have fewer communities the table is not set right.,189,,
787,0.97,5502.163,5510.104,The executive appointees seem to by virtue of that appointment feel like their voice carries more weight.,189,,
788,0.97,5510.104,5511.706,A good idea or not.,189,,
789,0.97,5511.706,5521.048,We just need to counteract the possibility of that or I will say it in my case the actual experience of that by the positions that were taken.,189,,
790,0.97,5521.048,5521.883,We have good ideas.,189,,
791,0.97,5521.883,5529.557,"Our ideas are rooted and experienced, with just my recent serving on that advisory committee.",189,,
792,0.97,5529.557,5543.971,It's a little bit of research and generally the idea that we set for not only going to have an impact on the particular body we are serving on for a city wide impact.,189,,
793,0.97,5543.971,5565.96,"So the idea the sitting advisory committee member have the most slots we could identify people for really increases the likelihood for representation, and that this will not be limited to selective circles, which tends to happen when we see executive appointments or appointments from other groups.",189,,
794,0.97,5565.96,5567.662,So that is how we're thinking about it.,189,,
795,0.97,5567.662,5570.264,That's how I'm thinking about it.,189,,
796,0.97,5570.264,5578.105,Just appreciate the opportunity in this forum to share with you.,189,,
797,0.97,5578.105,5584.211,I will turn it back.,189,,
798,0.97,5584.211,5584.712,Thank you.,189,,
799,0.97,5584.712,5585.279,Council member Morales?,189,,
800,0.97,5585.279,5585.68,That's great.,190,,
801,0.97,5585.68,5589.05,"Thank you, I want to appreciate all of you for being here and sharing your perspective.",190,,
802,0.97,5589.05,5595.356,I want to open it up for our committee members to ask questions.,190,,
803,0.97,5595.356,5605.099,I will take the prerogative of asking the first question.,190,,
804,0.97,5605.099,5609.437,I would like to hear about the mechanics of how the Advisory board works.,190,,
805,0.97,5609.437,5616.944,"So you have any number of, well, you have a process for soliciting applications.",190,,
806,0.97,5616.944,5633.027,"You have a process for going through the applications, and I would be interested in hearing a little bit about how that works, what the Dynamics are, and how you work through those decisions that you have to make.",190,,
807,0.97,5633.027,5642.737,"I'm asking this because as I mentioned, you know, we've got at least a $20 million investment coming in the next couple of years.",190,,
808,0.97,5642.737,5659.12,"So Ideally you will have the opportunity to be having some really meaty conversations about very important projects, so I would like to hear a little bit more about how that process works for you.",190,,
809,0.97,5660.821,5665.426,"I was waiting for my boss to answer that, but I will go ahead.",191,,
810,0.97,5665.426,5672.033,I was waiting for that Buzzer board members to answer and I would be happy to Chime in.,192,,
811,0.97,5672.033,5685.913,"I think it's important to note in addition to the funding, I just want to emphasize that the most Foundational work is also the group, really developing the program itself and that accountability and all the others.",192,,
812,0.97,5685.913,5690.551,They do a lot more work and the funding is very important.,192,,
813,0.97,5690.551,5693.721,I don't want to Miss that.,192,,
814,0.97,5693.721,5709.637,And I would like to recommend the Advisory board members that will also Chime in on this.,192,,
815,0.97,5709.637,5718.045,Whether you want to go through the structure of what is specific for the funding process.,192,,
816,0.97,5718.045,5722.216,And the membership for that advisory board.,192,,
817,0.97,5722.216,5724.051,"Council member, can you clarify that for us?",192,,
818,0.97,5724.051,5730.691,I'm interested in hearing a little bit about how the Advisory board will work?,193,,
819,0.97,5730.691,5753.013,"And so you know, I mean, we will talk about the appointment process, and which we will talk in a moment and we would like to talk a little bit about how that structure functions when it will come to making those decisions about the investments that we, you know, allocated the resources that we would have available?",193,,
820,0.97,5753.013,5753.247,Yes.,194,,
821,0.97,5753.247,5768.762,"And like some say the interim advisory board is with advising and recommending everything Edi, the program investments.",194,,
822,0.97,5768.762,5771.031,We have facilitated that we work with.,194,,
823,0.97,5771.031,5776.67,I think we had about 15 advisory board members to begin.,194,,
824,0.97,5776.67,5782.877,And now we probably have 11 that are active right now.,194,,
825,0.97,5782.877,5819.213,"We have monthly meetings of 90 minutes a month, where we, the Facilitator will create the agenda and sometimes with the Advisory board, and then the first year and a half we spent a lot of time creating the guidelines, the criteria, using the first initial Dem Straytive project with $6.5 million to if you get out how to set up the next $95 million.",194,,
826,0.97,5819.213,5843.337,Then the first year we would have a process in 2018 we actually had all the interim advisory board members participate in their review committee and with 37 applications that we would want to put together the interests policy in place.,194,,
827,0.97,5843.337,5856.283,The decisions were made out of all the groups that we have been a part of the advisory group and one group being funded.,194,,
828,0.97,5856.283,5860.921,Obviously as we all know money is Disorganizing.,194,,
829,0.97,5860.921,5880.774,"We did hear from the community that having people who heard of the organizations that got a proposal, would be a part of the review committee was a little problematic and not accessible for people who don't have a seat at the table.",194,,
830,0.97,5880.774,5891.719,We notified that the following year to have to wait before the applications could be improved to put together the meeting of people who did not have a conflict.,194,,
831,0.97,5891.719,5902.463,And it will include the funding and the other leadership experts who will work with the meeting like enterprise and the least group of Representatives.,194,,
832,0.97,5902.463,5928.055,"And then just continue every fall, we would put together a convenience and where we would put together a committee meeting that will include the interim advisory board to really first of all look and assess what Edi has accomplished that particular year.",194,,
833,0.97,5928.055,5931.058,And then also Co-Create the plan for the following year.,194,,
834,0.97,5931.058,5948.375,"So those are some of the things that the interim advisory board will help us work with, but days like you have been here and I would challenge them to Chime in and just ensure I'm not looking up stuff here.",194,,
835,0.97,5948.375,5950.544,"No, I'm not making up stuff.",195,,
836,0.97,5950.544,5964.725,The fact it does give me an opportunity to give some congratulations to Sam and your leadership team in selecting the folks you've got on this Edi team.,195,,
837,0.97,5964.725,5965.693,It's smart people.,195,,
838,0.97,5965.693,5978.105,And so naturally they come from the community with half the talent as we lend them to you to do that work downtown.,195,,
839,0.97,5978.105,5982.676,As a group like we are getting everything right.,195,,
840,0.97,5982.676,6000.828,"We've got issues within and among ourselves, but that is not different than any other body that we have and we think sometimes in that division when they would come to looking at matters like this, we do come together, bond it, to make the decision that we have known that will have a broader impact in just the decision itself.",195,,
841,0.97,6000.828,6016.21,And that is one of the things that will be a sub text to a lot of this and so those are a couple of things I wanted to kind of add to build out what Ubax has shared.,195,,
842,0.97,6016.21,6016.944,Thank you.,196,,
843,0.97,6016.944,6017.544,Thank you.,197,,
844,0.97,6017.544,6029.656,Colleagues are there any other questions or issues you would like to raise before we move on?,198,,
845,0.97,6029.656,6031.859,I'm not seeing or hearing anything.,198,,
846,0.97,6031.859,6038.298,I guess I would ask just one more question before we consider the amendment.,198,,
847,0.97,6038.298,6048.675,"Which is based on conversations that we have had, that I have had with some of our community members here.",198,,
848,0.97,6048.675,6062.856,There's an interest in amending the legislation to have more of the appointments made by the Advisory board itself and only three made by the Mayor and three made by the city council.,198,,
849,0.97,6062.856,6080.274,So I would be interested in hearing what benefit you think a change like that would bring to the operations or the way the permanent advisory board functions.,198,,
850,0.97,6080.274,6105.732,"I will jump in here and I think it goes back to just making certain there is a representation that we think should be a part of this and as I mentioned the board has been functioning very, very effectively and has managed to award $21 million and in capital capacity building.",199,,
851,0.97,6105.732,6113.24,"And with the activities, and so this is one of our programs that have allotted all over the country.",199,,
852,0.97,6113.24,6119.513,It is one of those successful programs that the city has.,199,,
853,0.97,6119.513,6133.026,"And one of the permanent structures, I would think it would bode the city well to recognize the work of the Advisory board in allowing the Advisory board to have them.",199,,
854,0.97,6133.026,6165.526,"And we would also achieve Quorum with the number of seats and not have to just Yeah, technically speaking, there would be that and I think for me it will be a recommendation that this needs to be centered in the community that we know best for determining priorities and how those funds should be allocated to the various development projects that you have heard of.",199,,
855,0.97,6165.526,6175.669,"And I will just add to, I'm not on the interim board, but I want to adhere and kind of echo your statements about centering community.",200,,
856,0.97,6175.669,6188.048,"What we heard earlier just from Ubax in her introduction was that when you ask for introducing this that they go through hundreds, some were saying hundreds of applicants and it is a lot of work.",200,,
857,0.97,6188.048,6205.232,"I think getting people who are tied to the communities where this work is being centered is essential in terms of making sure that it is a more community guided process, but also once again, being very inclusive.",200,,
858,0.97,6205.232,6212.606,"And in terms of mitigating some of the damages that haven't done with history, right?",200,,
859,0.97,6212.606,6216.21,And literally excluding these groups and having such a Top- down approach.,200,,
860,0.97,6216.21,6234.661,"I think it is important to note this wouldn't be so neutral, but this would be more heavily focused on the community in an effort to mitigate past damages that have been done to these communities, so I wanted to add that as well.",200,,
861,0.97,6234.661,6237.764,Okay.,201,,
862,0.97,6237.764,6249.876,"I want to move us along, so I'm going to ask you, I don't believe we have, we haven't moved to pass the bill yet.",201,,
863,0.97,6249.876,6252.779,"Am I suppose to move it first, so Lish can talk about it?",201,,
864,0.97,6252.779,6263.39,"Yes, since you already discussed it, you could move to amend the Council bill with the proposed amendment one Lish has provided.",202,,
865,0.97,6263.39,6267.961,Okay.,203,,
866,0.97,6267.961,6272.766,Council members there is an amendment Lish has provided.,203,,
867,0.97,6272.766,6282.609,"And Council member members, there are a couple of minor technical amendments to the version that was attached to my memo.",204,,
868,0.97,6282.609,6293.02,If I can share my screen and I will show Council members where those slide.,204,,
869,0.97,6293.02,6302.496,"I did E-mail this to folks early on in the day, but for the viewing public, let's go ahead and put that up.",205,,
870,0.97,6302.496,6307.301,All right.,206,,
871,0.97,6307.301,6311.338,And for the catch memo.,206,,
872,0.97,6311.338,6321.715,"And on the fourth right here, it clarifies three of the initial members of the board will be appointed by the interim advisory board.",206,,
873,0.97,6321.715,6329.056,Two other members would be coming from the interim advisory board as mayoral and Council appointees.,206,,
874,0.97,6329.056,6341.068,"That will ensure us we have at least nine members appointed at the beginning of the board, so they have a Quorum and can appoint the remaining board members.",206,,
875,0.97,6341.068,6359.286,"And the other change, I don't think this was in my memo, but the legislation will include a reporting requirement from the board to the director of the office of pending and community development and this amendment would ask they also send that to the city council.",206,,
876,0.97,6363.223,6365.359,"Thank you, Lish.",207,,
877,0.97,6365.359,6366.693,Okay.,207,,
878,0.97,6366.693,6370.297,"Sorry, Judy, are we suppose to discuss this?",207,,
879,0.97,6370.297,6374.668,Or did we move to amendment first?,207,,
880,0.97,6374.668,6375.936,I would move to amendment.,208,,
881,0.97,6375.936,6386.146,I see something and move to amendment Council bill 119887 and see if anyone has a comment on that amendment.,208,,
882,0.97,6386.146,6387.514,Thank you very much.,209,,
883,0.97,6387.514,6392.018,This is only my third committee meeting because of Covid.,209,,
884,0.97,6392.018,6395.922,"So Council members, there is an amendment.",209,,
885,0.97,6395.922,6399.659,I move to amendment Council bill 119887 as presented on amendment one.,209,,

941,0.97,6555.882,6566.159,As you may know you have an Rfp out on August 31 of $5.8 million.,246,,
942,0.97,6566.159,6582.642,"And funding will be allocated both to exist in Edi projects as well as new organizations, following the allocations, existing organizations will get $3.6 million.",246,,
943,0.97,6582.642,6596.056,"The second year capacity building, and some capital investments, for example, the projects that might be going under construction and things like that, that might need improvement will be in finding those groups.",246,,
