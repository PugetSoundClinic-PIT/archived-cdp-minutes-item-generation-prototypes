87,0.97,465.398,472.438,I'm calling because there is a need for an independent oversight of the homelessness response.,15,,

91,0.97,500.733,502.502,Such as crap coming out of the water pipes.,15,,

93,0.97,504.604,507.54,All while treated like a Subhuman.,15,,

96,0.97,522.188,523.656,They keep them honest and efforts.,15,,
97,0.97,523.656,534.467,Like it's another status quo decade for sharing this Lehigh Smorgasbord of inapt disservice.,15,,

118,0.97,614.213,618.751,I think this is extraordinarily difficult.,19,,
119,0.97,618.751,624.29,I have a great appreciation for that.,19,,
120,0.97,624.29,630.73,We have two former Councilmembers in the administration.,19,,
121,0.97,630.73,631.263,Tim Burgess and myself.,19,,
122,0.97,631.263,640.74,"We know all too well how Councilmembers, who are primarily responsible for policy, lawmaking and the budget.",19,,
123,0.97,640.74,641.941,Those are the primary functions.,19,,
124,0.97,641.941,645.177,"In addition to all of that, we see the work you do.",19,,
125,0.97,645.177,655.588,But how often many of you are blamed for the action or inaction of the executives and the departments.,19,,
126,0.97,655.588,665.398,"What I am pledging to all of you, and I hope I am press this upon you to my we will model transparency and collaboration.",19,,

129,0.97,670.403,679.712,"They have differences in the approaches but they want to see our machine for the city of Seattle, attack these problems.",19,,
130,0.97,679.712,687.319,"Quite candidly, this Committee and the work you do and homelessness is probably one of the most critical issues of the hour.",19,,
131,0.97,687.319,696.195,"One of my approaches, if you look at the state budget this year, a $62 billion supplemental budget.",19,,
132,0.97,696.195,703.135,As proposed by the governor we have about 334 million in capital housing.,19,,
133,0.97,703.135,710.342,There's about 100 million in about another 50 million in behavioral health services.,19,,

135,0.97,716.515,729.261,"Our goal, what I'm promoting resources into, is the largest economic driver of the state.",19,,
136,0.97,729.261,730.296,We want them to understand.,19,,
137,0.97,730.296,732.631,The legislatures need to understand that we need those resources.,19,,
138,0.97,732.631,736.268,We are putting in time there.,19,,
139,0.97,736.268,742.842,"I was in D.C. a few weeks ago and I met with resident Biden and the Secretary of housing, Marcia Fudge.",19,,
140,0.97,742.842,754.82,"I tried to impress upon them, with everything I had, amongst a handful of Mayors, that even if the build back better plan is currently proposed, about 1.75 trillion.",19,,
141,0.97,754.82,759.325,It's getting bounced around a lot.,19,,
142,0.97,759.325,768.234,There is close to 23 or 24 billion in housing choice vouchers.,19,,
143,0.97,768.234,771.704,There is 15 billion for the National housing trust fund.,19,,
144,0.97,771.704,781.347,"I am doing everything possible to make sure whatever comes out of D.C., again, they recognize the struggles.",19,,
145,0.97,781.347,782.581,I pitched it to the Secretary.,19,,
146,0.97,782.581,791.791,"Marcia Fudge, who I had gotten to know fairly well during my last trip.",19,,
147,0.97,791.791,793.459,I asked them about their images of Seattle.,19,,
148,0.97,793.459,798.964,"They know the large, high Tech companies and they know Starbucks and companies like that.",19,,
149,0.97,798.964,805.137,I'm trying to impress upon them that we have our issues of extreme poverty and extreme wealth in the city.,19,,
150,0.97,805.137,814.947,We need to figure out how we can fight Gentrification and fight it through Anti-Poverty strategies.,19,,
151,0.97,814.947,818.918,If we can figure this out in Seattle then we can take this message to the rest of the country.,19,,
152,0.97,818.918,821.954,"Quite candidly, based on our Federal lobbyists and a bunch of other folks, it's Resonates.",19,,
153,0.97,821.954,828.127,They need to understand what Seattle is.,19,,
154,0.97,828.127,834.233,"Whatever image they have, I was really trying to extract that information.",19,,
155,0.97,834.233,845.144,"I'm very, very optimistic, both from a state and Federal standpoint.",19,,
156,0.97,845.144,848.681,We will be able to garner a lot of resources here that will help us do our jobs.,19,,
157,0.97,848.681,852.117,"I've got to tell you, I want to thank all of you for doing the work.",19,,
158,0.97,852.117,853.953,I was down on the second floor last week.,19,,
159,0.97,853.953,855.454,I will continue to come down there.,19,,
160,0.97,855.454,857.856,"I want to meet with all of you, talk to all of you.",19,,
161,0.97,857.856,859.959,I want you all to be Superstars in your districts.,19,,
162,0.97,859.959,862.194,"Whether you are at large or not, just do your job.",19,,
163,0.97,862.194,863.195,I believe in you.,19,,
164,0.97,863.195,864.897,We are trying to solve the same problems.,19,,
165,0.97,864.897,868.234,I went over my two minutes.,19,,
166,0.97,868.234,876.542,"You didn't say I just had to minutes, chair Lewis.",19,,
167,0.97,876.542,878.377,I looked at the lineup of the Council.,19,,
168,0.97,878.377,880.679,Nearly all of you I have worked with in some capacity before.,19,,
169,0.97,880.679,887.92,"Many of you may recall that I used to say, when the Council takes their hits, I will defend the city council.",19,,
170,0.97,887.92,897.563,"Both its IQ, its commitment, its ability to work, it's Wherewithal.",19,,
171,0.97,897.563,905.971,"I said it to any city, to any counsel in this country, I believe that the city does its best to elect a good, strong leaders.",19,,
172,0.97,905.971,917.082,We may disagree on certain things but I do not attack your integrity or your in times.,19,,
173,0.97,917.082,918.25,I look at past administrations.,19,,
174,0.97,918.25,919.752,"Moving forward, I want to be her partner.",19,,
175,0.97,919.752,924.29,I want my departments to see you as a partner and not as an impediment.,19,,

180,0.97,937.87,940.272,"Mayor, thank you so much for those remarks.",20,,
181,0.97,940.272,947.246,"It's such a great way to start the meeting and start this discussion, based on this work over the last two years.",20,,
182,0.97,947.246,952.084,During Covid this has been incredibly frustrating.,20,,
183,0.97,952.084,967.933,"Just to echo and acknowledge one of the initial things that you said, and I think it centers the frustration that a lot of us, especially those of us representing district and all that are currently present in this Committee, and you your self as a former Councilmember.",20,,
184,0.97,967.933,974.473,All of our districts are hurting on this topic that we are discussing around homelessness and the homelessness response.,20,,
185,0.97,974.473,980.579,Even more so during Covid.,20,,
186,0.97,980.579,992.391,"A lot of us to have the scars of trying to work through those problems and being in a position where, as you acknowledged earlier, the Council has been blamed, Vilified, attacked.",20,,
187,0.97,992.391,999.231,"In many cases, unjustly, for things that fall outside of our Purview.",20,,
188,0.97,999.231,1008.273,Your acknowledgment of that today is extremely powerful and validating toward building the trust for the institutions to come together and do this work as one team.,20,,
189,0.97,1008.273,1014.013,I just wanted to speak to that and my heartfelt appreciation for that.,20,,
190,0.97,1014.013,1022.821,I know that all of us on here have been doing really hard work to make progress on these issues in the last two years.,20,,
191,0.97,1022.821,1030.028,And having a partner that's really going to center and work with us on that and pool as one team.,20,,
192,0.97,1030.028,1031.43,That's something we are incredibly excited about.,20,,
193,0.97,1031.43,1033.165,So thank you so much for your words.,20,,
194,0.97,1033.165,1042.875,We look forward to working on this topic and others with you and your administration throughout this hearing and beyond.,20,,
195,0.97,1042.875,1044.276,"I appreciate your response, Councilmember Lewis.",21,,
196,0.97,1044.276,1055.587,I'm going to let deputy Mayor Washington lead the discussion and I will bow out for a little while.,21,,
197,0.97,1055.587,1056.789,Thank you so much for having me.,21,,
198,0.97,1056.789,1058.424,Thank you.,22,,
199,0.97,1058.424,1059.491,"Deputy Mayor Washington, take it away.",22,,
200,0.97,1059.491,1060.492,Thank you Mayor Harrell.,23,,
201,0.97,1060.492,1067.266,Thank you chairman Lewis.,23,,
202,0.97,1067.266,1069.568,I want to answer some things that you have all submitted.,23,,
203,0.97,1069.568,1073.071,I think Councilmember Lewis pulled folks in and sent it to myself.,23,,
204,0.97,1073.071,1075.107,Director came is here.,23,,
205,0.97,1075.107,1083.615,I know that director Jones will be here shortly.,23,,
206,0.97,1083.615,1086.985,My apologies for looking at this shortly.,23,,
207,0.97,1086.985,1088.654,The answers are here and my screen is here.,23,,
208,0.97,1088.654,1090.289,I will try to go back and forth.,23,,
209,0.97,1090.289,1103.068,Before I start I want to just acknowledge that the region is fiscally operational and has assumed oversight of the city's homelessness contracts.,23,,
210,0.97,1103.068,1117.616,"They are also the lead on strategic planning, performance management, community engagement, addressing homelessness within our region.",23,,
211,0.97,1117.616,1136.101,"Allowing a true regional response to take place that centers equity and the voices of people with lived experience requires us all to shift power that we have historically held, over to the regional housing authority, were guided by and accountable to the coalition, implementation board and governing committee.",23,,
212,0.97,1136.101,1142.674,"What this does not mean is that we leave behind our accountability to taxpayers and community members of Seattle, as we are charged with ensuring that we are effectively deploying public resources.",23,,
213,0.97,1142.674,1151.75,I think a few of you have had an incident where you have asked the question and it may feel like we are Punting to mark's organization.,23,,
214,0.97,1151.75,1162.161,What I want to say is we will work with you to get you what you need in partnership with the director.,23,,
215,0.97,1162.161,1165.03,"The first question that I received was, what lessons were learned from winter response?",23,,
216,0.97,1165.03,1170.602,We will spend a couple minutes talking about lessons learned.,23,,
217,0.97,1170.602,1175.107,I will pass it to director came in a minute.,23,,
218,0.97,1175.107,1188.587,People experiencing homelessness and it will not cover the extent of the notable efforts that were led by other city departments through the winter storm.,23,,
219,0.97,1188.587,1192.124,Response activation began in December and stretched into January.,23,,
220,0.97,1192.124,1209.107,"It took an incredible amount of staff time and mobilization at a time when we are being hit by Omicron and people were calling out sick and we were short staffed, both in the city and at community organizations.",23,,
221,0.97,1209.107,1227.693,Before passing it off to director Kim I really want to thank the staff and the homeless strategy and investments team who worked really hard to respond to during the winter storm at the same time they were trying to transition all of the work over to the regional housing authority.,23,,
222,0.97,1227.693,1232.264,For that I will pass it over to director Kim.,23,,
223,0.97,1232.264,1237.569,And then mark will answer the same question later in the meeting.,23,,
224,0.97,1237.569,1237.97,Director Kim?,23,,
225,0.97,1237.97,1239.004,"Thank you, deputy Mayor.",24,,
226,0.97,1239.004,1245.377,For the record I am the acting director of the Seattle human services Department for Hsd.,24,,
227,0.97,1245.377,1258.79,"For the viewing audience, Hsd provides services and investments in Community-Based organizations and programs that serve communities by connecting people with resources and solutions during times of need.",24,,
228,0.97,1258.79,1260.993,I really appreciate the Mayor's office.,24,,
229,0.97,1260.993,1277.142,The deputy Mayor of Washington and of course the Council chair for allowing Hsd to speak and being able to Recap some of the highlights of what we have learned just weeks ago during mobilization.,24,,
230,0.97,1277.142,1282.547,I wanted to highlight a couple of key items.,24,,
231,0.97,1282.547,1292.324,One is the tremendous collaboration that occurred across various departments with strong leadership from our office of emergency management.,24,,
232,0.97,1292.324,1301.566,"The scope of the services provided during the past weather event, it was possible because of collaboration.",24,,
233,0.97,1301.566,1304.436,Several departments and emergency response partners supported the cities need.,24,,
234,0.97,1304.436,1309.875,"Specifically to supplement the capacity constraints across the shelter system, related to Covid-19.",24,,
235,0.97,1309.875,1318.517,And also for the constraints by winter holiday staffing absences.,24,,
236,0.97,1318.517,1323.422,"In lame terms, you have heard this, this is not new.",24,,
237,0.97,1323.422,1327.492,"Our providers, as well as some of our own staff, provided direct services.",24,,
238,0.97,1327.492,1330.529,They were stretched for all of those reasons.,24,,
239,0.97,1330.529,1331.63,"Covid, a couple of years.",24,,
240,0.97,1331.63,1333.365,People were out sick.,24,,
241,0.97,1333.365,1337.602,People were off when the situation arose.,24,,
242,0.97,1337.602,1342.474,We really had to rally.,24,,
243,0.97,1342.474,1348.013,We did things a little bit differently this past winter and learned some valuable lessons.,24,,
244,0.97,1348.013,1354.186,"Some key highlights include, as I have mentioned, the collaboration.",24,,
245,0.97,1354.186,1361.793,"That collaboration, in particular, also during this transition, included or worked with the county regional homelessness authority.",24,,
246,0.97,1361.793,1366.965,And both Mayor administrations.,24,,
247,0.97,1366.965,1374.639,I really have to hand it to the outgoing Mayor as well as the incoming Mayor for that cross collaboration to make sure this was seamless during that period of time.,24,,
248,0.97,1374.639,1377.275,Over the course of the activation six shelters were opened.,24,,
249,0.97,1377.275,1381.179,Specifically in response.,24,,
250,0.97,1381.179,1387.018,That represents 379 beds of nightly capacity.,24,,
251,0.97,1387.018,1387.919,That was at the peak.,24,,
252,0.97,1387.919,1392.457,We didn't start with all six.,24,,
253,0.97,1392.457,1396.361,"At our peak, when all six are activated, we had 379 beds.",24,,
254,0.97,1396.361,1404.803,"Through the efforts of our provider partners, who really are the stars.",24,,
255,0.97,1404.803,1405.37,Incredible providers.,24,,
256,0.97,1405.37,1409.107,Some were prepared and others were contractors that stepped up.,24,,
257,0.97,1409.107,1421.887,"We were able to provide 2116 total overnight stays . again, that was 2116 total overnight stays.",24,,
258,0.97,1421.887,1429.027,That was in the period of December 25th through January 2ND.,24,,
259,0.97,1429.027,1429.494,The lessons learned.,24,,
260,0.97,1429.494,1430.462,There were many.,24,,
261,0.97,1430.462,1437.335,One is our ability to offer surge staffing.,24,,
262,0.97,1437.335,1451.049,"We had an executive order that really Incentivized, not only our city employees, but also our provider employees to provide equity.",24,,
263,0.97,1451.049,1456.621,Through that offering there were 171 city staff who opted in to be redeployed as needed.,24,,
264,0.97,1456.621,1457.622,We didn't redeploy all 171.,24,,
265,0.97,1457.622,1482.247,"But it does go to show that in the case we needed to, that there were folks who had opted in and we were close with the departments to identify who had been approved and where people can go and what they were able to do, including driving and staffing the winter warming shelter center.",24,,
266,0.97,1482.247,1485.951,"There was the additional incentive pay, as I had mentioned, for employees as well as providers.",24,,
267,0.97,1485.951,1495.594,We also really understand the need to continue plans to provide accessibility.,24,,
268,0.97,1495.594,1497.262,Accessibility was kept in mind for the winter shelters.,24,,
269,0.97,1497.262,1504.636,"That does include everything from transportation, geographic diversity, which is important to all of the Councilmembers.",24,,
270,0.97,1504.636,1509.708,And we reduced the barriers for someone to utilize a shelter or warming center.,24,,
271,0.97,1509.708,1511.81,Things like we have heard.,24,,
272,0.97,1511.81,1516.047,Some offered food.,24,,
273,0.97,1516.047,1518.55,There was light hospitality.,24,,
274,0.97,1518.55,1528.26,"Or the warming centers, for example, there was some ask for the need to accommodate additional pets.",24,,
275,0.97,1528.26,1531.897,Those are things we continue to work out.,24,,
276,0.97,1531.897,1536.301,And challenges around being able to offer storage was significant.,24,,
277,0.97,1536.301,1544.876,I saw that firsthand with somebody who didn't want to leave their belongings behind.,24,,
278,0.97,1544.876,1546.912,That made sense in many ways.,24,,
279,0.97,1546.912,1553.518,Storage was a big deal too.,24,,
280,0.97,1553.518,1560.759,"One of the lessons learned too, we have heard loud and clear people are looking for the 24/7 access.",24,,
281,0.97,1560.759,1562.36,In some cases that was not readily available.,24,,
282,0.97,1562.36,1573.204,Looking at those warming centers and seeing how we can potentially increase the usage rates if the warming centers are the option.,24,,
283,0.97,1573.204,1576.374,As opposed to multiple 24/7 locations being available.,24,,
284,0.97,1576.374,1579.244,Transportation was another major item.,24,,
285,0.97,1579.244,1586.985,We did the best that we could by planning it in advance over transportation to get folks to where they need.,24,,
286,0.97,1586.985,1594.593,"Not only from the warming centers, in some cases to the shelters.",24,,
287,0.97,1594.593,1601.499,But also from the shelters to additional shelter options after the severe weather occurrence.,24,,
288,0.97,1601.499,1613.011,That was definitely a gap that we are trying to fill.,24,,
289,0.97,1613.545,1617.782,For those who can also be appropriate for wheelchair access and other needs.,24,,
290,0.97,1617.782,1618.85,There are many lessons learned.,24,,
291,0.97,1618.85,1622.287,We continue to collaborate.,24,,
292,0.97,1622.287,1623.188,We are having planning sessions.,24,,
293,0.97,1623.188,1629.094,Those are just some highlights coming out of the storm.,24,,
294,0.97,1629.094,1631.83,Hopefully we won't have another one coming up in the next few weeks.,24,,
295,0.97,1631.83,1632.43,But we are ready.,24,,
296,0.97,1632.43,1632.831,Thank you.,24,,
297,0.97,1632.831,1642.507,"Interim director Kim, any questions for the Councilmembers about winter weather?",25,,
298,0.97,1642.507,1643.308,Councilmember Herbal?,26,,
299,0.97,1643.308,1643.575,Yes.,27,,
300,0.97,1643.575,1650.648,"I really appreciate the overview, Dr. Kim, on the lessons learned.",27,,
301,0.97,1650.648,1660.492,I would like a bit of clarification as it relates to the West Seattle winter weather response shelter.,27,,
302,0.97,1660.492,1670.669,I heard you say there wasn't a need to redeploy everybody that has signed up in the city family to be redeployed.,27,,
303,0.97,1670.669,1693.925,That surprised me because when we were struggling to clarify whether or not the West Seattle shelter was going to be open or not we were told of the issue was not a staffing issue and they were going to advertise being open until they secured staff.,27,,
304,0.97,1693.925,1708.873,"We went, not to our city family that volunteered to be redeployed, but to the faith communities and the church Council and the Westside interfaith network are the ones who got the volunteers necessary for the winter response shelter in West Seattle.",27,,
305,0.97,1708.873,1715.013,I'm wondering why that is if we had bodies of city workers who are ready to go.,27,,
306,0.97,1715.013,1720.185,That's a great question.,28,,
307,0.97,1720.185,1721.886,It really was a matter of timing.,28,,
308,0.97,1721.886,1728.359,"By the time I had a conversation with that organization, there ask of me was to support their utilities.",28,,
309,0.97,1728.359,1731.696,At that time they had secured the volunteers.,28,,
310,0.97,1731.696,1738.436,Then we were able to offer the redeployment option.,28,,
311,0.97,1738.436,1739.871,That wasn't something we planned in advance.,28,,
312,0.97,1739.871,1742.207,We developed that because we had heard from various providers.,28,,
313,0.97,1742.207,1752.217,We are at risk of not even being able to offer the basic services because people are calling out sick.,28,,
314,0.97,1752.217,1759.157,We don't have enough staff.,28,,
315,0.97,1759.157,1760.925,So we stood up with the opt in option.,28,,
316,0.97,1760.925,1762.026,We did not Preplan that.,28,,
317,0.97,1762.026,1765.93,"When I had the conversation again with the West Seattle organization, there ask was to offset the cost of utilities.",28,,
318,0.97,1765.93,1767.098,We were happy to provide that.,28,,
319,0.97,1767.098,1774.539,I do remember the issue of your good work on the offset of utilities.,29,,
320,0.97,1774.539,1805.603,"In real time, when I was dealing with inquiries from constituents for why the shelter wasn't being publicly noticed as being open, over at the regional health authority was reported to Hst that they were recommending that it not be listed as available until they knew for sure that they had the staff resources.",29,,
321,0.97,1805.603,1811.809,And they went and got volunteers from Westside interfaith network.,29,,
322,0.97,1811.809,1819.584,And the church Council.,29,,
323,0.97,1819.584,1825.19,"Hsd, as I understand it, was aware of the staffing needs.",29,,
324,0.97,1825.19,1836.968,"Rather than redeploy our own staff, there was this lag where the regional authority was working with the faith network to get volunteers.",29,,
325,0.97,1836.968,1838.002,A lesson learned I guess.,29,,
326,0.97,1838.002,1839.003,Thank you for that.,30,,
327,0.97,1839.003,1848.346,"One thing that you have raised, just in general, is our ability to work with our community partners.",30,,
328,0.97,1848.346,1854.385,And more broadly step into these volunteer spaces.,30,,
329,0.97,1854.385,1863.494,"Also your calling out something very important, which is also the Handoff and our collaboration with Rha.",30,,
330,0.97,1863.494,1874.038,We were able to finally all get on the same page and make sure we were offering what they needed to continue to operate as a volunteer organization that we really support.,30,,
331,0.97,1874.038,1881.479,"When we have that direct conversation, by the time Hst made that phone call, I made that phone call.",30,,
332,0.97,1881.479,1883.281,It was really about we can do this.,30,,
333,0.97,1883.281,1888.82,We've got the people.,30,,
334,0.97,1888.82,1890.488,What we really needed was help with the utilities.,30,,
335,0.97,1890.488,1891.489,"Again, I think it's timing.",30,,
336,0.97,1891.489,1894.559,But it goes to show how we work with our partners.,30,,
337,0.97,1894.559,1897.161,I know mark and I were talking about this a lot in advance.,30,,
338,0.97,1897.161,1897.895,The severe weather response.,30,,
339,0.97,1897.895,1909.107,We offered that technical assistance and really having a clear understanding of the capacity and what that even entails around communications and mapping and all of that.,30,,
340,0.97,1909.107,1915.413,I think people are doing excellent work but we want to make sure we are fully supporting organizations to do their best and not be overwhelmed.,30,,
341,0.97,1915.413,1921.185,That is a lesson learned for all of us.,30,,
342,0.97,1921.185,1926.391,Any other questions from community members?,31,,
343,0.97,1926.391,1926.791,Okay.,31,,
344,0.97,1926.791,1932.13,"I want to ask a quick question about the weather response, relating to the staffing.",31,,
345,0.97,1932.13,1941.105,A sort of similar Piggybacking off of Councilmember Herbal's remarks.,31,,
346,0.97,1941.105,1941.973,I understand.,31,,
347,0.97,1941.973,1944.042,"Director Kim, this may have applied to you as well.",31,,
348,0.97,1944.042,1944.509,A measure.,31,,
349,0.97,1944.509,1956.654,The staffing had gotten to such a point where I know the director at one point took a shift themselves at a shelter to make sure it could be operational.,31,,
350,0.97,1956.654,1974.172,We really appreciate director Dones stepping in like that to guarantee the efficacy of the response and address where the gap is needed.,31,,
351,0.97,1974.172,1987.352,"I wonder if preparing for the future, because we have a lot of city employees that I know would probably be interested in potential opportunities to serve.",31,,
352,0.97,1987.352,1995.56,"I know, in other respects, snow removal and other things, folks have been given overtime from other departments to pitch in.",31,,
353,0.97,1995.56,1996.761,I believe I saw that somewhere.,31,,
354,0.97,1996.761,2011.642,If Maybe there could be some kind of training where city employees and other kinds of workers might be qualified to take a staffing shift at a shelter or something like that for some kind of Preapproved overtime opportunity.,31,,
355,0.97,2011.642,2013.478,And if that might be something we could explore.,31,,
356,0.97,2013.478,2030.194,"My understanding is the sheltering assets, if something stood out temporarily for a week, it's not like we are expecting anybody to be a case manager or a mental health counselor or a substance addiction counselor.",31,,
357,0.97,2030.194,2041.973,"But we do need people to kind of be present, to have eyes on the shelter and help run the shelter to maybe distribute some basic services.",31,,
358,0.97,2041.973,2047.145,Supplies like towels.,31,,
359,0.97,2047.145,2055.586,We could potentially cover that through some kind of training and some auxiliary workforce that could be covered.,31,,
360,0.97,2055.586,2060.525,"Some of these assets, just throwing out there as a potential idea.",31,,
361,0.97,2060.525,2066.497,I wonder what your responses to that might be.,31,,
362,0.97,2066.497,2067.565,I think you are right.,32,,
363,0.97,2067.565,2068.8,He summarized it really well.,32,,
364,0.97,2068.8,2071.068,There's a lot of opportunity here about what we have learned.,32,,
365,0.97,2071.068,2071.903,There is something about it.,32,,
366,0.97,2071.903,2073.771,I can't wait for mark to have Airtime.,32,,
367,0.97,2073.771,2083.948,I know that we are also talking about how we really empower the community and the Community- based providers to fill the space.,32,,
368,0.97,2083.948,2086.217,"That way the city employees, it's kind of a last resort.",32,,
369,0.97,2086.217,2094.625,How do we ensure that they are trained and fully staffed in getting those wages that they are asking for?,32,,
370,0.97,2094.625,2102.667,"If the Citysearch is needed in the future, training and all those other things, absolutely we can prepare for it.",32,,
371,0.97,2102.667,2111.008,"Just as a reminder to the group, I don't want to Oversimplify the situation.",32,,
372,0.97,2111.008,2115.947,"There can be multiple things happening where we had planned for the shelter closure because the emergency order was ending, it was getting warmer.",32,,
373,0.97,2115.947,2117.181,What we had was an outbreak.,32,,
374,0.97,2117.181,2125.256,"In that unique circumstance, it required unique care for the customers.",32,,
375,0.97,2125.256,2127.558,Those who are experiencing homelessness.,32,,
376,0.97,2127.558,2136.3,Not for them to just leave but to make sure they were well and they were being taken care of and they were able to quarantine appropriately.,32,,
377,0.97,2136.3,2142.64,That's where I saw mark step into that role and become that provider.,32,,
378,0.97,2142.64,2146.344,We made that phone call the night before.,32,,
379,0.97,2146.344,2147.778,We need to step into that.,32,,
380,0.97,2147.778,2150.882,That's where I said I would join in the effort.,32,,
381,0.97,2150.882,2156.487,It's not for the lack of staff who could have reported in some way.,32,,
382,0.97,2156.487,2164.729,It was the unique circumstances and the realization that we had an outbreak.,32,,
383,0.97,2164.729,2165.763,I will speak for myself.,32,,
384,0.97,2165.763,2185.483,"I didn't want to make a phone call that night, or at 6:00 in the morning, to have one of my staff deployed . I can go out and take care of it myself in partnership with mark and the hope team and the provider that was there.",32,,
385,0.97,2185.483,2187.518,So we were not fulfilling that role at all the shelters.,32,,
386,0.97,2187.518,2190.821,"We always had a culturally responsive, very skilled provider, who can offer those shelter needs.",32,,
387,0.97,2190.821,2196.561,We were filling in the specific gap about addressing the Covid transition of where folks would go after the shelter was closing.,32,,
388,0.97,2196.561,2200.665,It's a unique Confluence of circumstances.,32,,
389,0.97,2200.665,2205.036,I really appreciate that additional context.,33,,
390,0.97,2205.036,2213.477,"It does just seem like, going forward, I don't know how unique some of these fact patterns are going to be.",33,,
391,0.97,2213.477,2217.815,Like every time there is a response.,33,,
392,0.97,2217.815,2228.893,"We are beginning year three of this pandemic and we have this new, very problematic variant right now that coincided with the snowstorm.",33,,
393,0.97,2228.893,2231.128,We could get another snowstorm in February.,33,,
394,0.97,2231.128,2237.802,I know that we don't want to obviously.,33,,
395,0.97,2237.802,2243.441,Unfortunately it's one of those things that we don't have any say in it when a snowstorm comes along.,33,,
396,0.97,2243.441,2256.02,"I don't know, at least for this season and looking forward, we will have to be planning around the potential of a heat Dome or extreme weather.",33,,
397,0.97,2256.02,2261.392,"On the other side, in the summer.",33,,
398,0.97,2261.392,2267.098,Which involves similar mobilization.,33,,
399,0.97,2267.098,2271.235,There could potentially be similar vulnerability if it coincides with an outbreak.,33,,
400,0.97,2271.235,2292.79,I guess it's good that we have this . We now have this data of that Confluence and the problem it solves so that we can prepare for something potentially happening like that again this winter or perhaps in the summer when we are in a position for smoke or extreme heat related things.,33,,
401,0.97,2292.79,2295.626,Did you have something to add to that?,33,,
402,0.97,2295.626,2329.56,"I wanted to make sure that one of the comments, Councilmember Lewis, when we looked at providing additional pay to city staff it actually was a member of Hsd's change team in elder in the work who said to us, we can do that without acknowledging our community providers and offering them the same pay as we are offering city staff.",34,,
403,0.97,2329.56,2332.83,At that moment it highlighted something that I think director Kim was trying to state.,34,,
404,0.97,2332.83,2346.01,The community is willing to step in . There are things that our neighbors and shelter no.,34,,
405,0.97,2346.01,2350.181,I want to give credit to Hst for this.,34,,
406,0.97,2350.181,2354.452,We never thought about offering incentive pay for folks to step up to the plate.,34,,
407,0.97,2354.452,2355.653,I saw both.,34,,
408,0.97,2355.653,2362.626,I saw a great community response and a staffing response.,34,,
409,0.97,2362.626,2375.906,"Councilmember Lewis, I think what you're saying is let's have those folks in our staff ready in the rare case we need to utilize them if there aren't enough community members that can staff it.",34,,
410,0.97,2375.906,2377.341,I think director Kim and I totally agree.,34,,
411,0.97,2377.341,2382.046,Let's not wait until the storm comes to prepare.,34,,
412,0.97,2382.046,2384.048,Let's get ready for it now.,34,,
413,0.97,2384.048,2386.016,"Also to build on that, totally.",35,,
414,0.97,2386.016,2391.856,I totally agree with you.,35,,
415,0.97,2391.856,2398.996,Adding in the fact we do have a robust training portal.,35,,
416,0.97,2398.996,2410.741,"We have a city family of well over 10,000 city employees who have some related Trainings and the gaps could be filled in with some kind of training.",35,,
417,0.97,2410.741,2412.209,Structured around the extreme weather mitigation shelters.,35,,
418,0.97,2412.209,2413.444,Maybe that's an asset to look at.,35,,
419,0.97,2413.444,2420.117,They can be activated as the last line of Defense to avoid the worst of the worst occurring.,35,,
420,0.97,2420.117,2427.425,I do have one last question.,35,,
421,0.97,2427.425,2428.793,Councilmember Herbal may have covered this.,35,,
422,0.97,2428.793,2431.328,This is sort of my third conversation around the winter weather response.,35,,
423,0.97,2431.328,2437.168,We sort of discussed it at to the regional governing board.,35,,
424,0.97,2437.168,2447.711,"Transportation of folks experiencing homelessness, making sure that people are able to get to some of the shelters.",35,,
425,0.97,2447.711,2473.337,"Also in some cases a barrier that a lot of folks were reporting on is folks are put into this what they see as a Hopson choice of wanting to get inside because it was incredibly cold and snowy, but worry that if they left without all of the stuff in their Campsite it wouldn't be there if they ever ultimately got back.",35,,
426,0.97,2473.337,2475.472,Or that someone might still something when they were gone.,35,,
427,0.97,2475.472,2492.656,"Ways to maybe Co-Plan around storage of people's stuff, as well as transportation and logistics involved in that.",35,,
428,0.97,2492.656,2501.632,I wonder if there are plans between the authority and Hst to assess those hurdles where there was some resistance for fear of losing all of your stuff.,35,,
429,0.97,2501.632,2502.867,And how we might address that.,35,,
430,0.97,2502.867,2508.072,That is definitely in the planning.,36,,
431,0.97,2508.072,2509.44,It's on the to do list.,36,,
432,0.97,2509.44,2509.74,Absolutely.,36,,
433,0.97,2509.74,2513.31,I believe that storage has been an ongoing matter that we have been exploring.,36,,
434,0.97,2513.31,2518.249,Absolutely.,36,,
435,0.97,2518.249,2520.851,That's important.,36,,
436,0.97,2520.851,2538.936,We did have folks and providers offering some tools for folks who did not want to leave.,36,,
437,0.97,2539.203,2541.171,Absolutely.,36,,
438,0.97,2541.171,2545.976,Councilmember Herbal.,37,,
439,0.97,2545.976,2559.323,I want to return to the theme of members of our wonderful city family who have signed up to be redeployed.,38,,
440,0.97,2559.323,2571.635,Using those within the context of our efforts to encourage the library to open their facilities for a warming center during the day.,38,,
441,0.97,2571.635,2579.209,My recollection is we did have libraries open up as cooling centers in the summertime.,38,,
442,0.97,2579.209,2583.38,We did not have the same problem.,38,,
443,0.97,2583.38,2593.557,"Maybe it's because, in that instance, they didn't have a staffing crisis.",38,,
444,0.97,2593.557,2595.726,They didn't open up as cooling centers with the existing staff.,38,,
445,0.97,2595.726,2614.345,"I did find it troubling to learn that the library, as I understand it, was unwilling to have our city staff come in and join them, to staff the libraries so that they could be open as warming centers during Te day.",38,,
446,0.97,2614.345,2621.285,I was wondering if you could speak to that as well.,38,,
447,0.97,2621.285,2624.221,Thanks.,38,,
448,0.97,2624.221,2628.125,"Director Kim, I am not in the know on whether or not the libraries declined a request.",39,,
449,0.97,2628.125,2636.233,"What I can say, Councilmember Herbold, is thank you to Mayor Harold who really focused my portfolio.",39,,
450,0.97,2636.233,2652.616,I can actually ask that question directly and find out why that happened and connect with director Kim and mark to see if we can have that settled before any other issue comes up.,39,,
451,0.97,2652.616,2656.286,I have been meeting with community members all week.,39,,
452,0.97,2656.286,2664.528,Libraries have come up multiple times as a mystery source in multiple cases.,39,,
453,0.97,2664.528,2673.137,I will find that out.,39,,
454,0.97,2673.137,2673.804,I'm sorry.,40,,
455,0.97,2673.804,2674.405,I'm sorry.,41,,
456,0.97,2674.405,2676.64,I heard that mark is going to be on at three.,41,,
457,0.97,2676.64,2678.108,They have a hard stop at 3:30.,41,,
458,0.97,2678.108,2689.586,"My question to you, chair Lewis, I have two questions left that you all had for me.",41,,
459,0.97,2689.586,2692.122,One was about executive Pacific and one was about storage capacity increase.,41,,
460,0.97,2692.122,2695.893,Which one would you like me to start with in the event that we run out of time?,41,,
461,0.97,2695.893,2696.727,Let's do executive Pacific.,42,,
462,0.97,2696.727,2708.372,I will stay on during director Dones' time.,43,,
463,0.97,2709.706,2710.04,Thanks.,44,,
464,0.97,2710.04,2715.546,"The question was, what will happen to people currently sheltered at executive Pacific and how will funds that should have supported the extension be used?",45,,
465,0.97,2715.546,2725.722,"Out of the gate, I want you to know that we stand in line with you and not one person in the hotel will be back to the street.",45,,
466,0.97,2725.722,2729.46,We cannot have that happen.,45,,
467,0.97,2729.46,2739.369,"As George scurrilous said, there are many in the hotel.",45,,
468,0.97,2739.369,2746.343,It's in the process of Ramping down and will close on January 31st.,45,,
469,0.97,2746.343,2748.579,This has always been the anticipated Timeline for this program to end.,45,,
470,0.97,2748.579,2756.353,There recently was a request made to Casey Rha to extend the lease at the hotel.,45,,
471,0.97,2756.353,2756.954,Which was explored.,45,,
472,0.97,2756.954,2769.933,They did not approve the extension due to the significant increase in cost and requirement to extend until September.,45,,
473,0.97,2769.933,2785.082,"Executive specific, it required a nine month commitment and nearly a 30% increase in cost in order to extend the lease.",45,,
474,0.97,2785.616,2788.852,"That would go up to 550,000 a month from 435,000 a month.",45,,
475,0.97,2788.852,2801.932,"Also if the extension were to have been granted, the exception said that Lehigh would have to serve a new Cohort of people and not the existing Cohort for a longer period of time.",45,,
476,0.97,2801.932,2818.582,"So to address this in Mid- October, staff from Hst and Kcrha and Catholic community services began Conferencing with the Lehigh team to identify housing solutions for all of the clients in the emergency housing program.",45,,
477,0.97,2818.582,2822.452,The technical assistance remains.,45,,
478,0.97,2822.452,2829.459,I'm happy to keep you updated as we move closer to the in date.,45,,
479,0.97,2829.459,2837.901,"From what I have been told, most of the individuals that are part of the remaining 82 have a housing plan in place.",45,,
480,0.97,2837.901,2849.213,"As was said, if someone has a housing plan that is 20 days away from January 31st we are just going to have to find a temporary solution for them.",45,,
481,0.97,2849.213,2860.224,Whether it be another hotel or motel to house them until they have a permanent solution.,45,,
482,0.97,2860.224,2861.925,That is the update on the executive Pacific.,45,,
483,0.97,2861.925,2862.726,I'm happy to take questions.,45,,
484,0.97,2862.726,2864.962,Questions from the Committee on executive Pacific?,46,,
485,0.97,2864.962,2886.283,"One thing I do want to flag at the beginning here is I am interested in having a committee hearing to dive in, generally, to the work that we did on this rapid Rehousing concept, over the course of 2021.",46,,
486,0.97,2886.283,2891.955,"And to kind of have, at that time, a little more substantive evaluation.",46,,
487,0.97,2891.955,2893.523,I appreciate having this update at this time.,46,,
488,0.97,2893.523,2911.241,"I would rather Reserve bigger questions that might go to the overall outcomes of the program and kind of ultimately how this plan to wind down would work out in more of an after action report kind of hearing, sometime in February.",46,,
489,0.97,2911.241,2918.148,With that context I will do one more call for some potential questions.,46,,
490,0.97,2918.148,2923.487,"Deputy Mayor, it looks like we may get through your storage update too.",46,,
491,0.97,2923.487,2937.267,I would just say that we do have Seattle public libraries on here that has a presentation.,46,,
492,0.97,2937.267,2939.703,You said mark is going to join us at 3:00?,46,,
493,0.97,2939.703,2940.103,Yes.,47,,
494,0.97,2940.103,2949.212,I think it's best that we just jump into the storage update and then maybe by then mark will be around.,48,,
495,0.97,2949.212,2949.846,"Apologies, Councilmember.",49,,
496,0.97,2949.846,2952.249,There is a camp section that I can hit really quick.,49,,
497,0.97,2952.249,2952.516,Okay.,50,,
498,0.97,2952.516,2958.021,The question around camp second chance was about how quickly we can get it stood up.,51,,
499,0.97,2958.021,2969.099,I'm going to reserve the question for the contract amendment and program side for mark to answer and they are prepared to do so.,51,,
500,0.97,2969.099,2973.203,I did check in with Spu.,51,,
501,0.97,2973.203,2985.382,"They let me know that they have two hygiene shower trailers that they own, because they purchased them earlier in the pandemic.",51,,
502,0.97,2985.382,2986.583,They are ready to deploy them.,51,,
503,0.97,2986.583,2988.452,They also have contracts in place for affordable toilets.,51,,
504,0.97,2988.452,2998.362,"It sounds like, to me, that as soon as the units are stood up they can have these installed fairly quickly.",51,,
505,0.97,2998.362,3001.164,That's really great news on camp second chance.,52,,
506,0.97,3001.164,3005.369,I do have one question related to that.,52,,
507,0.97,3005.369,3014.044,"These are hygiene assets that are going to be plugged in with running water, just to confirm.",52,,
508,0.97,3014.044,3016.947,I'm familiar with that trailer product.,52,,
509,0.97,3016.947,3023.887,So that's great.,52,,
510,0.97,3023.887,3029.993,Maybe Councilmember Herbold can speak to this as someone who has been engaged with camp second chance a lot longer than I have.,52,,
511,0.97,3029.993,3036.6,"There have been issues with the site in terms of where to run, like the water hookups.",52,,
512,0.97,3036.6,3053.75,"Has that been--it sounds like Sbu is confident they can install those assets, which is great.",52,,
513,0.97,3053.75,3055.786,Do we have any indication on whether that has been resolved?,52,,
514,0.97,3055.786,3056.62,I will ask.,53,,
515,0.97,3056.62,3059.723,"They did not mention that, which is leading me to believe that it is resolved.",53,,
516,0.97,3059.723,3061.725,I will make a formal ask and let you know.,53,,
517,0.97,3061.725,3062.392,Great.,54,,
518,0.97,3062.392,3062.826,I appreciate that.,54,,
519,0.97,3062.826,3067.23,So you still have one last thing on your list.,54,,
520,0.97,3067.23,3067.664,The storage.,54,,
521,0.97,3067.664,3073.203,Unless there are questions about camp second chance before we move on from there.,54,,
522,0.97,3073.203,3076.106,Just as a little bit of context for the public on camp second chance.,54,,
523,0.97,3076.106,3083.58,That is one of the things we have approved in the budget at the governing committee last Thursday.,54,,
524,0.97,3083.58,3089.219,"That kind of triggers some work on the city side, as we just discussed with Seattle public utilities.",54,,
525,0.97,3089.219,3100.363,There will be some related updates when Kcrha comes for the report.,54,,
526,0.97,3100.363,3101.832,"Councilmember Herbold, you had a question or comment?",54,,
527,0.97,3101.832,3105.936,"I just want to underscore, I think this is the point you were trying to make, chair Lewis.",55,,
528,0.97,3105.936,3107.938,There are two separate investments in camp second chance.,55,,
529,0.97,3107.938,3124.988,"One is related to the provision of hygiene services as well as some funding provided to Lehigh because they had a plan, provided they had the resources, to run the line.",55,,
530,0.97,3124.988,3139.436,"Secondly, there was the investment to expand the size of camp second chance to allow for about 20 additional tiny houses.",55,,
531,0.97,3139.436,3143.673,Correct.,56,,
532,0.97,3143.673,3146.076,I appreciate the Bifurcation and expectations associated with those separate investments.,57,,
533,0.97,3146.076,3146.776,You're absolutely right.,58,,
534,0.97,3146.776,3151.815,I have 20 new units and have expanded and enhanced supportive services as well.,58,,
535,0.97,3151.815,3155.685,We are excited about the 20 new units.,58,,
536,0.97,3155.685,3159.856,"Chair Lewis, there are two more.",58,,
537,0.97,3159.856,3166.429,Woodland park and increase shelter.,58,,
538,0.97,3166.429,3170.1,We can bump the capacity to when mark comes on because a lot of it sits in their camp.,58,,
539,0.97,3170.1,3172.602,"But the question was, why is woodland park our highest priority?",58,,
540,0.97,3172.602,3180.177,I just want to state that the Mayor has expressed that woodland Park is a top priority.,58,,
541,0.97,3180.177,3184.114,Which is very different than saying it is the highest priority.,58,,
542,0.97,3184.114,3194.724,"As you all know, during Covid, the CDC instructed all jurisdictions to refrain from moving Encampments to reduce the spread of the virus.",58,,
543,0.97,3194.724,3216.913,"As a result we saw some of the largest Encampments in city history, which staff and providers spent the last six months of 2020, some in partnership with Councilmembers who are on this call, working tirelessly to ensure many campers as possible were brought into the space and things restored.",58,,
544,0.97,3216.913,3226.923,"Because this collaborative method has proved to be highly successful, we are bringing it into this year.",58,,
545,0.97,3226.923,3229.025,Woodland Park is a top priority for several reasons.,58,,
546,0.97,3229.025,3231.461,One is we have a high level of community Buy-In and support.,58,,
547,0.97,3231.461,3235.565,"The community is really standing up to say, we want to help in any way we can in a supportive way.",58,,
548,0.97,3235.565,3246.576,"Outreach efforts will already be underway, led by reach and the Scofflaw mitigation for the Rv park.",58,,
549,0.97,3246.576,3254.317,"Last but not least, we know to address the camp of this size, it will take a tremendous amount of outreach effort, case management and shelter resources.",58,,
550,0.97,3254.317,3256.686,This is not a site that can be addressed in 30 days.,58,,
551,0.97,3256.686,3259.789,Therefore we want to start as early as possible.,58,,
552,0.97,3259.789,3263.36,I hope that answers the question of why it is a top priority for us.,58,,
553,0.97,3263.36,3263.994,Thank you.,59,,
554,0.97,3263.994,3276.573,Are there any questions for Mayor Washington on the woodland park situation?,59,,
555,0.97,3276.573,3276.773,Okay.,59,,
556,0.97,3276.773,3277.24,I'm seeing none.,59,,
557,0.97,3277.24,3281.177,I think we can move on to the next agenda item.,59,,
558,0.97,3281.177,3287.651,Or rather the next bullet of this agenda.,59,,
559,0.97,3287.651,3288.752,"Go ahead, deputy Mayor Washington.",59,,
560,0.97,3288.752,3289.686,That's all I had.,60,,
561,0.97,3289.686,3291.755,The other question was about increasing shelter capacity.,60,,
562,0.97,3291.755,3296.893,It is on mark's list as well.,60,,
563,0.97,3296.893,3299.796,I will wait until mark answers that and we will join them in a response.,60,,
564,0.97,3299.796,3301.598,It's going to take both of us.,60,,
565,0.97,3301.598,3304.934,We are the Funder.,60,,
566,0.97,3304.934,3310.407,Kcrha has the funding to give to the provider to stand up for the shelter.,60,,
567,0.97,3310.407,3317.38,"What I will say before mark gets on the phone, what I see are the shelter resources including the 2022 budget.",60,,
568,0.97,3317.38,3326.956,$2.4 million in ongoing funding to support shelters.,60,,
569,0.97,3326.956,3331.127,"150,000 in ongoing funding to expand camp second chance by 20 units.",60,,
570,0.97,3331.127,3343.707,"And one .175 million and one- time funding, $225,000 to create and operate safe parking lots.",60,,
571,0.97,3343.707,3346.009,All of the funding has been Transitioned to the regional housing authority.,60,,
572,0.97,3346.009,3355.118,I look forward to hearing from director Dones on the Timeline to stand up the shelter that was added in the 2022 budget.,60,,
573,0.97,3355.118,3356.953,Great.,61,,
574,0.97,3356.953,3357.754,Thank you.,61,,
575,0.97,3357.754,3368.264,"Deputy Mayor Washington, a thing that we do not yet have.",61,,
576,0.97,3368.264,3373.203,I do not want to waste the committees time.,61,,
577,0.97,3373.203,3377.674,We do have Tom Fay from Seattle public libraries on here.,61,,
578,0.97,3377.674,3386.015,"Mr. Fay, are you on the line or away from your computer currently?",61,,
579,0.97,3386.015,3390.854,He's not coming off of me so I guess he is.,61,,
580,0.97,3390.854,3392.889,Here's what we do.,61,,
581,0.97,3392.889,3401.464,"I hope mark is here at 3:00, as indicated.",61,,
582,0.97,3401.464,3405.034,There is Tom.,61,,
583,0.97,3405.034,3405.268,Great.,61,,
584,0.97,3405.268,3416.112,What I would like to do with the committees indulgence is Maybe we could move forward and start the presentation on the second agenda item.,61,,
585,0.97,3416.112,3428.358,"If everyone on agenda item one could stay handy and maybe go on mute, get a cup of coffee, we can reconvene this conversation when mark gets here.",61,,
586,0.97,3428.358,3432.328,"Mr. Clark, would you please read agenda item 2 into the record?",61,,
587,0.97,3432.328,3435.532,"Item 2, counsel built 20258.",62,,

592,0.97,3457.954,3459.489,I'm happy to turn it over to them.,63,,

594,0.97,3467.73,3473.069,"Thank you, chair Lewis.",64,,

605,0.97,3501.731,3509.739,Do you need a moment to get situated before you start or are you ready to jump into it?,67,,
606,0.97,3509.739,3520.183,"I'm happy to begin whenever you're ready, chair.",68,,
607,0.97,3520.183,3523.486,"If I could get Joel promoted so that he can run slides, that would be great.",68,,

623,0.97,3588.451,3594.424,I can get going.,70,,
624,0.97,3594.424,3594.824,Sorry.,70,,
625,0.97,3594.824,3600.163,"Marc Dones, regional homeless authority, for the record.",70,,
626,0.97,3600.163,3600.83,"Marc, I'm sorry.",71,,
627,0.97,3600.83,3606.369,The clerk just reminded me that you guys are actually your own separate agenda item.,71,,
628,0.97,3606.369,3618.114,Which is agenda item 3. I just ask that the clerk read that into the record and we will go forward with it here.,71,,
629,0.97,3618.114,3630.66,Item 3. King County--regional authority update on homelessness investments and the response.,72,,
630,0.97,3630.66,3630.927,Great.,73,,

632,0.97,3632.462,3632.996,Please take it away.,73,,

634,0.97,3639.736,3642.872,If we could go back.,74,,
635,0.97,3642.872,3643.172,Thank you.,74,,
636,0.97,3643.172,3649.178,Just to start off.,74,,
637,0.97,3649.178,3656.552,"For those of you who haven't been following along in the public, I know most of the Councilmembers have been deeply involved and I'm grateful for that.",74,,
638,0.97,3656.552,3658.655,Just a little Recap.,74,,
639,0.97,3658.655,3661.491,I was hired in March of last year.,74,,
640,0.97,3661.491,3664.661,We began in April.,74,,
641,0.97,3664.661,3668.097,Our first year was more like nine months.,74,,
642,0.97,3668.097,3682.011,We were very focused on organizational development and Ramp-Up during that time.,74,,
643,0.97,3684.547,3686.349,"We have expanded to 32, and are still growing.",74,,
644,0.97,3686.349,3689.619,I heard from the chief administrative officer this morning that we had five people starting this week.,74,,
645,0.97,3689.619,3706.369,We are consistently focused on Ramping up the capacity necessary to administer the funds that you all have transferred over to us and to make sure that the system and the providers have the support they need in order to do the good work they do.,74,,
646,0.97,3706.369,3716.412,"I know director Kim and deputy Mayor Washington were speaking to a just now, in response to severe weather.",74,,
647,0.97,3716.412,3719.282,Our grants and contracts management system is up and running as of January 1ST.,74,,
648,0.97,3719.282,3729.025,We are the organization agency responsible for all of the billing.,74,,
649,0.97,3729.025,3732.328,"I will say, as one quick note, I'm happy to take any questions on this.",74,,
650,0.97,3732.328,3738.901,We have extended the Timeline for providers to sign their contracts with us in response to the Covid search.,74,,
651,0.97,3738.901,3747.81,They will be able to bill for January and invoice against the work they are doing.,74,,
652,0.97,3747.81,3755.585,After several discussions with the provider community over the last couple of weeks they are quite tapped.,74,,
653,0.97,3755.585,3757.787,We are trying to relieve as much administrative burden as possible.,74,,
654,0.97,3757.787,3762.925,"Our first budget cycle, 60% of our funding came from the city of Seattle.",74,,
655,0.97,3762.925,3770.733,34% from King County for about a $162.4 million budget.,74,,
656,0.97,3770.733,3779.075,There is some additional Federal dollars.,74,,
657,0.97,3779.075,3787.116,I hope to see some other sorts of private investment flow into that pot over the course of the year to ramp up some of the work we do.,74,,
658,0.97,3787.116,3792.955,For our sub regional planning activities we have been working with the county.,74,,
659,0.97,3792.955,3800.163,Every city in King County.,74,,
660,0.97,3800.163,3806.135,"And all the organizations to map out the services gaps and partnership opportunities that fit for each of our seven unique Subregions, of which Seattle Metro is one.",74,,
661,0.97,3806.135,3811.908,"I want to lift up the work, Mercedes, who leads a team.",74,,
662,0.97,3811.908,3815.344,"And Carlson, actually the Seattle regional manager.",74,,
663,0.97,3815.344,3825.888,Both of whom who have done exceptional work to strongly understand the needs of our community experiencing homelessness.,74,,
664,0.97,3825.888,3827.089,And also to provide support every day.,74,,
665,0.97,3827.089,3829.692,Next slide please.,74,,
666,0.97,3829.692,3830.893,So what is next?,74,,
667,0.97,3830.893,3838.401,I think you all know I'm a little obsessed with having the right information to make the right decisions.,74,,
668,0.97,3838.401,3848.544,We are very focused on understanding the number of people who need our help and very focused on understanding the needs of those people.,74,,
669,0.97,3848.544,3862.291,"As I believe you are all aware, in partnership with King County D.C. Hs, there were 4500 people that experienced homelessness in the county in 2016.",74,,
670,0.97,3862.291,3867.23,"In 2020 that number dropped to around 40,000.",74,,
671,0.97,3867.23,3881.51,"We, as a policy priority, will be indexing against the 45,000 number, in part because we believe the decline was more about people having fewer places to show up to be seen as a result of the pandemic.",74,,
672,0.97,3881.51,3886.482,We will continue to operate.,74,,
673,0.97,3886.482,3889.919,"I'm sorry, my dog is being very noisy right now.",74,,
674,0.97,3889.919,3899.562,We will continue to use that number as the baseline for what we think we need as resources to accomplish it.,74,,
675,0.97,3899.562,3901.264,And then where to go from here.,74,,
676,0.97,3901.264,3903.633,Do you want to lift up?,74,,
677,0.97,3903.633,3905.868,That is more than three times the last point count number.,74,,
678,0.97,3905.868,3909.972,We can continue to hold that.,74,,
679,0.97,3909.972,3916.779,Our community needs to strive towards better data collection.,74,,
680,0.97,3916.779,3931.294,"We will be executing, if the surge hopefully Peters out as the models predict, we will be executing relative research and a rough Unshelved account in March.",74,,
681,0.97,3931.294,3939.602,The qualitative research component is something I'm all about in response to the coalition and others.,74,,
682,0.97,3939.602,3947.009,"We really want to learn what our Unshelved her neighbors, who do not utilize our services, are not seeing.",74,,
683,0.97,3947.009,3949.612,What can we do to better support them?,74,,
684,0.97,3949.612,3956.352,We will also be driving toward a list.,74,,
685,0.97,3956.352,3958.587,"Those 45,000 folks who have been identified, turn them into real people.",74,,
686,0.97,3958.587,3966.228,"Where the system can actually understand not just that there is a number but that each of those folks has a name, a life, and needs.",74,,
687,0.97,3966.228,3970.866,We need to be responsive to those.,74,,
688,0.97,3970.866,3976.639,We are going to complete our system redesign and rebate for 2023 over the course of the first two quarters of this year.,74,,
689,0.97,3976.639,3985.514,"Again, a little bit of wiggle room there in terms of relationship to the surge and just our ability to safely and successfully engage the community.",74,,
690,0.97,3985.514,3993.589,"Next slide, please.",74,,
691,0.97,3993.589,3995.891,Speaking to the committee's request on an update on the severe weather.,74,,
692,0.97,3995.891,4001.23,I know that the Mayor and deputy Mayor have spoken to this.,74,,
693,0.97,4001.23,4016.612,"From our perspective I will just say it was frankly more successful than I had hoped, given that we were Transitioning in the middle of the severe weather incident.",74,,
694,0.97,4016.612,4022.151,"I want to give a particular shout out to director Kim, who is just an incredible ally.",74,,
695,0.97,4022.151,4027.857,And a very supportive and collaborative person throughout the incident.,74,,
696,0.97,4027.857,4032.194,Just a tremendous leader.,74,,
697,0.97,4032.194,4036.699,We worked extensively with the Seattle office of emergency management also shut out there.,74,,
698,0.97,4036.699,4046.609,The director over there is a super sharp and really effective at making sure we all came together and that we had our coordinating calls.,74,,
699,0.97,4046.609,4060.89,We made sure the authority was wired into those coordinator calls and had all of the information that we needed in order to make sure that our providers who are running the severe weather shelters had the supplies and support that they needed to be successful.,74,,
700,0.97,4060.89,4066.862,"The regional response was managed by the authority, in collaboration with cities and providers.",74,,
701,0.97,4066.862,4069.331,"We had daily Coronation calls for our North, South, and he's County Subregions.",74,,
702,0.97,4069.331,4074.737,Next slide please.,74,,
703,0.97,4074.737,4078.674,This shows sort of where things were over the course of the incident.,74,,
704,0.97,4078.674,4082.411,The red dots represent severe weather shelters.,74,,
705,0.97,4082.411,4089.785,The dark blue represent places at expanded capacity in response to the incident.,74,,
706,0.97,4089.785,4102.731,The dark green represents King County libraries that were open for most days during the incident and served as a de facto warming centers for folks.,74,,
707,0.97,4102.731,4114.243,And then the Orange are known warming centers that folks were able to access over the course of the incident.,74,,
708,0.97,4114.243,4114.543,Next slide.,74,,
709,0.97,4114.543,4115.678,It was a 12 day event.,74,,
710,0.97,4115.678,4120.649,Lasting from December 23rd to January 23rd.,74,,
711,0.97,4120.649,4127.456,"In Seattle, as you know, we had six overnight shelters.",74,,
712,0.97,4127.456,4130.726,The capacity was about 374.,74,,
713,0.97,4130.726,4132.161,The utilization ranged between approximately 65 and 77%.,74,,
714,0.97,4132.161,4141.604,"I'm happy to talk about the theories around that utilization, as I'm sure the deputy Mayor can as well.",74,,
715,0.97,4141.604,4142.805,We had a capacity of around 260.,74,,
716,0.97,4142.805,4144.473,Usage of around 80%.,74,,
717,0.97,4144.473,4148.611,"In South King we had 12 overnight shelters, East King, seven.",74,,
718,0.97,4148.611,4157.319,"Overnight, two Safes are parking programs using hotels and to cities offering hotel vouchers.",74,,
719,0.97,4157.319,4158.954,In North King we had three overnight shelters.,74,,
720,0.97,4158.954,4163.926,One city was offering hotel vouchers.,74,,
721,0.97,4163.926,4178.073,"I will also add that some of the limitations on this data are that we do not know how many people, regionally, were vouchers into hotels.",74,,
722,0.97,4178.073,4187.216,There is some number of people who were assisted over the course of the incident that we cannot see in this data.,74,,
723,0.97,4187.216,4187.65,Next slide.,74,,
724,0.97,4187.65,4189.652,"This is a quick graph, regionally, of severe weather.",74,,
725,0.97,4189.652,4196.659,Shelter by availability overtime against unit occupancy.,74,,
726,0.97,4196.659,4215.377,"You can see, from a Trendline, the occupancy Trended about 20 points below the available units, until the tail and where we begin to ramp down some severe weather shelters.",74,,
727,0.97,4215.377,4215.778,Next slide.,74,,
728,0.97,4215.778,4222.585,"Some of the challenges, which I believe the committee has discussed a little bit with the director Kim and deputy Mayor Washington.",74,,
729,0.97,4222.585,4228.791,"For transportation, as we know, it was more than the cold.",74,,
730,0.97,4228.791,4229.225,Right?,74,,
731,0.97,4229.225,4230.759,It was the snow.,74,,
732,0.97,4230.759,4231.493,And the ice.,74,,
733,0.97,4231.493,4244.673,"It made it incredibly difficult for transit operators to function, which made it very difficult for folks experiencing Unshelved homelessness to get to some of the facilities that were open.",74,,
734,0.97,4244.673,4250.312,There is a lesson learned there.,74,,
735,0.97,4250.312,4265.828,"I mentioned to both the implementation board and the governing committee and the regional policy Committee, in a similar update, that we had done some work via King County of office of emergency management.",74,,
736,0.97,4265.828,4270.799,They were capped at about $30 a ride.,74,,
737,0.97,4270.799,4277.273,During the incident the surge pricing kicked in on the list and the rides were $130.,74,,
738,0.97,4277.273,4277.506,Right?,74,,
739,0.97,4277.506,4284.98,"The way the vouchers are structured by the company, you can only use one voucher per person.",74,,
740,0.97,4284.98,4287.85,"We couldn't even stack them, knowing that the ride was going to be more expensive.",74,,
741,0.97,4287.85,4302.631,"Certainly there's just a lot to be done around anticipating the transit needs of folks, and really leaning in there.",74,,
742,0.97,4302.631,4306.602,Anybody who has heard me talk in the last six months knows that our system is experiencing a staffing crisis.,74,,
743,0.97,4306.602,4309.271,"That was true over the incident, the same way it is today.",74,,
744,0.97,4309.271,4311.507,The solution is we need to rebuild the workforce pipeline.,74,,
745,0.97,4311.507,4316.812,We need to pay people more.,74,,
746,0.97,4316.812,4325.02,"I look forward to working with this Committee and appropriators across the region, at the state and Federal level, in order to make sure we are able to do that.",74,,
747,0.97,4325.02,4328.891,Food and meal access also came up.,74,,
748,0.97,4328.891,4347.91,"One of the things I think I heard from a number of folks who are experiencing homelessness is that when the food wasn't great, particularly during the day hours of the warming centers, it's a disincentive to stay there.",74,,
749,0.97,4347.91,4350.379,You are going to find food that make sense for you.,74,,
750,0.97,4350.379,4360.422,"We really want to make sure we are providing good meals for folks, and Covid medication.",74,,
751,0.97,4360.422,4364.827,"I believe, again, this was part of the conversation you had with director Kim.",74,,
752,0.97,4364.827,4371.4,It was a significant challenge and remains a significant challenge for systemwide.,74,,
753,0.97,4371.4,4375.037,"Ultimately, from a public health perspective, I need to be very clear for the sake of the public.",74,,
754,0.97,4375.037,4381.477,"The correct decision was to open the severe weather shelters, knowing the Covid mitigation was going to be difficult.",74,,
755,0.97,4381.477,4387.549,The cold was lethal.,74,,
756,0.97,4387.549,4396.191,"It absolutely would have, and I believe in some cases did, cause death.",74,,
757,0.97,4396.191,4397.192,Covid was more of a Tossup.,74,,
758,0.97,4397.192,4398.227,That was the unfortunate math.,74,,
759,0.97,4398.227,4401.23,I want to be really clear.,74,,
760,0.97,4401.23,4405.901,Running that math is and of itself a form of failure.,74,,
761,0.97,4405.901,4420.482,What we need to have is a system that has the Non- congregate capacity every day to support the people that experience homelessness.,74,,
762,0.97,4420.482,4429.224,And some overcapacity for incidences like these.,74,,
763,0.97,4429.224,4429.825,Next slide.,74,,
764,0.97,4429.825,4431.66,Our next steps are to Debrief with our Subregions.,74,,
765,0.97,4431.66,4436.565,Those processes have begun.,74,,
766,0.97,4436.565,4443.539,"Here, in Seattle, that process is really led by the office of emergency management.",74,,
767,0.97,4443.539,4456.585,"Again, grateful for the work that they do to identify strategies to address those challenges, like staffing and transportation, and to develop emergency management protocols and funds for severe weather events.",74,,
768,0.97,4456.585,4463.225,I did lifted up for the governing community at our meeting last week.,74,,
769,0.97,4463.225,4481.877,"In the future, I believe it will be necessary to seek the creation of some form of emergency fund that I could seek permission to access, and be granted the access by the implementation board and the governing committee to respond when an incident hits a certain scope or scale.",74,,
770,0.97,4481.877,4499.127,I certainly believe a severe weather incident during an infectious disease outbreak easily means it meets the standards around funds that we would need access to for things like that.,74,,
771,0.97,4499.127,4501.23,Next slide.,74,,
772,0.97,4501.23,4502.431,That is it.,74,,
773,0.97,4502.431,4503.165,Just one more thing.,74,,
774,0.97,4503.165,4504.967,"If you would allow me, Mr.",74,,
775,0.97,4504.967,4517.312,"Chair, I want to note that some of our severe weather response was modified in flight by our partnerships with lived experiences.",74,,
776,0.97,4517.312,4518.113,I'm really grateful for that.,74,,
777,0.97,4518.113,4521.149,I think it's an important thing to lift up.,74,,
778,0.97,4521.149,4522.317,We partnered with the coalition.,74,,
779,0.97,4522.317,4542.437,And with some of our folks who are living in vehicles to identify harm reduction strategies to keep people alive and Fed and warm for when they needed to shelter in place for whatever reason and not transition into one of the severe weather shelters.,74,,
780,0.97,4542.437,4550.646,I'm grateful to the folks from the lived experience coalition.,74,,
781,0.97,4550.646,4554.483,And other folks in the Residency space who lifted up those needs.,74,,
782,0.97,4554.483,4557.619,It's a very bright and clear in a way that allowed us to quickly respond.,74,,
783,0.97,4557.619,4562.024,"I want to build on that work, moving forward.",74,,
784,0.97,4562.024,4573.669,"Acknowledging that the occupancy rates we see in the severe weather shelters tell us something about how many people are going to use them, against how many people we need to support over the course of an incident.",74,,
785,0.97,4573.669,4587.983,We will be working internally with my team and also with our lived experience colleagues and others to develop more robust strategies for the next incident and the incident after that and beyond.,74,,
786,0.97,4587.983,4588.417,Thank you.,74,,
787,0.97,4588.417,4590.986,Think you so much for that presentation.,75,,
788,0.97,4590.986,4597.392,When we take a pause here for questions directly related to the snow response presentation?,75,,
789,0.97,4597.392,4604.499,Are there any colleagues that would like to ask some questions on this topic?,75,,
790,0.97,4604.499,4605.233,Okay.,75,,
791,0.97,4605.233,4611.873,I'm seeing none.,75,,
792,0.97,4611.873,4631.627,"Director Dones, are there other topics you want to recover in your remarks before we open it up to questions regarding the authority and moving forward together on the budget that we approved last Thursday?",75,,
793,0.97,4632.694,4635.263,We want to give you an opportunity to expand a little bit first.,75,,
794,0.97,4635.263,4636.531,Then I'm happy to open it up.,75,,
795,0.97,4636.531,4640.369,"I want to state, for the record, Councilmember Mosqueda has joined the meeting and is here as well.",75,,
796,0.97,4640.369,4642.07,"Marc, I will hand it back over to you.",75,,
797,0.97,4642.07,4643.038,"Thank you, chair.",76,,
798,0.97,4643.038,4644.873,Our team is really excited to get to work.,76,,
799,0.97,4644.873,4647.843,We've been planning and planning.,76,,
800,0.97,4647.843,4651.513,It's a day 19 of us actually being the organization.,76,,
801,0.97,4651.513,4663.358,Of actually being the authority vested with the budget and the actual policy and tools.,76,,
802,0.97,4663.358,4673.702,There is a hum in the air around the virtual office as people really get to lean in to the work they signed up to do.,76,,
803,0.97,4673.702,4677.339,I'm grateful for the budget support from the city of Seattle to continue to do that work.,76,,
804,0.97,4677.339,4692.788,I wanted to lift up something that actually Councilmember Mosqueda said when she came in and spoke to our implementation board.,76,,
805,0.97,4692.788,4695.057,The budget cycle is not how that is supposed to work.,76,,
806,0.97,4695.057,4696.992,I just want everyone to hear that.,76,,
807,0.97,4696.992,4704.266,I know that the Councilmembers and I had the opportunity for this conversation.,76,,
808,0.97,4704.266,4715.01,"But the way that budget cycle worked was very like, I came on board and did a bunch of rapid assessments and then tried to say, we need these things.",76,,
809,0.97,4715.01,4715.243,Right?,76,,
810,0.97,4715.243,4736.565,"I'm really appreciative of the partnership that got us to where we are and I'm looking forward to having the conversation over the course of the spring and summer so that when we get to the budget it's not a hail Mary pass at the end, but a thoughtful, Communitywide conversation about how we can be successful.",76,,
811,0.97,4736.565,4736.998,That's all.,76,,
812,0.97,4736.998,4741.503,There will be plenty more budget processes in the future.,77,,
813,0.97,4741.503,4747.042,"We will have the opportunity to do it all again in short order, I'm sure.",77,,
814,0.97,4747.042,4758.286,I have a couple of quick questions to start and then I want to open it up to colleagues and then we can move on to our patient friends at Seattle public libraries for the last agenda item.,77,,
815,0.97,4758.286,4776.771,"The first thing, as we covered a little in the earlier presentation with the Mayor's office and human services Department was regarding the approved budget for city investments.",77,,
816,0.97,4776.771,4778.306,A Timeline for us to deploy those assets.,77,,
817,0.97,4778.306,4785.313,I know we have a shared interest in doing that with speed and efficacy.,77,,
818,0.97,4785.313,4809.571,"For the first question, we have heard some in the provider community among Councilmembers and myself, the Timeline of the 5.8% cost-of-living adjustment that the council passed for the folks who are doing this work.",77,,
819,0.97,4809.571,4811.406,I know that this is a shared commitment.,77,,
820,0.97,4811.406,4820.081,"Marc, I appreciate that everywhere you go you lift up how we need to treat, center, pave this work for how we can.",77,,
821,0.97,4820.081,4825.887,I will start talking about that 5.8% and plans to get that deployed into the hands of the folks that are out there doing this.,77,,
822,0.97,4825.887,4851.012,"Then the second question would be around the programmatic expansion of shelter and housing capacity that we funded in the budget, and the progress in standing that up, so we can continue the process of offering folks who are living in and Kimmons in the city, particularly relevant to this community, city parks.",77,,
823,0.97,4851.012,4858.954,An alternative place to live that is not a city park but a place that people can be safe and sustained.,77,,
824,0.97,4858.954,4864.626,I will throw those two questions out first and then open it up to other folks.,77,,
825,0.97,4864.626,4869.965,"With that, I will hand it back over to you.",77,,
826,0.97,4869.965,4870.365,Sure.,78,,
827,0.97,4870.365,4879.574,"On the provider pay, my understanding is that increase was being reviewed by CBO and has been approved and can be implemented.",78,,
828,0.97,4879.574,4890.852,"As soon as it shows up, I need a contractual vehicle that says I have money and then I can spend it.",78,,
829,0.97,4890.852,4907.068,"I believe that director Kim, who is still here and can speak to this if I'm wrong, I believe that director Kim has approved that on her end.",78,,
830,0.97,4907.903,4911.84,We are in the final stages to be able to implement and be able to distribute that to providers.,78,,
831,0.97,4911.84,4912.774,It should not take much time.,78,,
832,0.97,4912.774,4914.876,"Again, I will lift up that we have offered providers.",78,,
833,0.97,4914.876,4916.077,They don't have to take it.,78,,
834,0.97,4916.077,4917.245,I want to be clear.,78,,
835,0.97,4917.245,4925.086,But we have offered them grace with the execution of their contracts.,78,,
836,0.97,4925.086,4928.056,Right?,78,,
837,0.97,4928.056,4935.93,"It will go into effect, including the increase in pay.",78,,
838,0.97,4935.93,4944.239,I'm appreciative of all efforts by this Council to ensure our providers make some money.,78,,
839,0.97,4944.239,4948.977,I will see if director Kim wants to join me.,78,,
840,0.97,4948.977,4954.649,"I'm acting director of the human services, Dr. Kim.",79,,
841,0.97,4954.649,4972.6,"As Marc had mentioned, we have MSA, a master service agreement coming their way because of additional ads and other consolidation of some funds.",79,,
842,0.97,4972.6,4974.069,That is happening as we speak.,79,,
843,0.97,4974.069,4975.303,We are working on that right now.,79,,
844,0.97,4975.303,4978.606,It's coming in and we will get it out as soon as possible.,79,,
845,0.97,4978.606,4985.246,Just so people have clear OPTICS into the collaboration here.,80,,
846,0.97,4985.246,4988.917,At this point I think director Kim and I talk maybe every day.,80,,
847,0.97,4988.917,4995.323,We are moving on the assumption that it is coming.,80,,
848,0.97,4995.323,5000.428,Not just waiting for something to materialize.,80,,
849,0.97,5000.428,5004.866,"We just can't execute a document that says, here is new money, until we execute a document saying that we have it.",80,,
850,0.97,5004.866,5007.402,That's the law.,80,,
851,0.97,5007.402,5015.977,Are there any other comments on the pay increase before we pivot to shelter capacity?,81,,
852,0.97,5015.977,5020.982,I appreciate that summary.,81,,
853,0.97,5020.982,5026.087,It sounds like we will have an update on some progress in the next committee meeting.,81,,
854,0.97,5026.087,5029.224,Are there any other questions on that?,81,,
855,0.97,5029.224,5029.791,All right.,81,,
856,0.97,5029.791,5030.191,I'm seeing none.,81,,
857,0.97,5030.191,5034.562,Why don't we pivot to the shelter capacity?,81,,
858,0.97,5034.562,5056.951,We had a conversation earlier about camp second chance expansion and the Seattle city is ready on its and to do long- overdue work to get utilities into camp second chance.,81,,
859,0.97,5056.951,5068.463,The first part here may be an update on kind of how we are looking to do components of the camp second chance expansion where we can live with the authority.,81,,
860,0.97,5068.463,5076.671,And then obviously some of the other shelter ads around sheltering assets and other things that we put into the budget in the fall.,81,,
861,0.97,5076.671,5091.453,Any update there in terms of Timeline or how that work is being put together to take those things from paper to reality?,81,,
862,0.97,5091.453,5104.165,"On camp second chance, specifically, because it is an existing site, it is funded already in our fy 2020 to work.",82,,
863,0.97,5104.165,5112.006,"As discussed, the implementation board and the government and everything was approved.",82,,
864,0.97,5112.006,5120.081,Camp second chance was in line with anything that was operationally sound.,82,,
865,0.97,5120.081,5125.887,We will get out the door with all due haste.,82,,
866,0.97,5125.887,5140.568,"I believe, and I can confirm this and be ready for the committee afterwards, but my understanding for the program officer is that all of the level funding agreements have left the authority already.",82,,
867,0.97,5140.568,5148.409,For this expansion money we may need to circle back and add it.,82,,
868,0.97,5148.409,5155.35,That shouldn't take any time.,82,,
869,0.97,5155.35,5155.783,January 19th.,82,,
870,0.97,5155.783,5160.522,That should be done by the next time we talk to each other.,82,,
871,0.97,5160.522,5168.93,There's no bid or no thing that we have to do.,82,,
872,0.97,5168.93,5169.197,Great.,83,,
873,0.97,5169.197,5176.304,"Is there follow-up, Councilmember Herbold?",83,,
874,0.97,5176.304,5177.338,I think I'm wrong.,84,,
875,0.97,5177.338,5191.252,"There may be a thing that needs doing, which is a look at the Footprint that camp second chances on right now, versus the surrounding land they are not on.",84,,
876,0.97,5191.252,5191.452,Fas.,84,,
877,0.97,5191.452,5196.858,Aching sure we have an agreement on the expansion Footprint.,84,,
878,0.97,5196.858,5200.862,Maybe that's already done.,84,,
879,0.97,5200.862,5205.8,That would be something.,85,,
880,0.97,5205.8,5218.112,That would be something that I think deputy Mayor Washington and director Kim can speak to more fluently.,85,,
881,0.97,5218.112,5219.147,I didn't mean you.,86,,
882,0.97,5219.147,5220.582,I meant anything to be done.,86,,
883,0.97,5220.582,5221.216,Not necessarily you.,86,,
884,0.97,5221.216,5222.917,"That was a great Callout, Councilmember Herbold.",87,,
885,0.97,5222.917,5229.757,I will put that on my to do list to make sure we are able to do the thing.,87,,
886,0.97,5229.757,5230.592,I appreciate that.,88,,
887,0.97,5230.592,5238.199,I have had some very initial conversations with fire chief Scoggins about my interest in this area.,88,,
888,0.97,5238.199,5248.076,He has a willingness to talk because the joint training facility is on that land.,88,,
889,0.97,5248.076,5250.111,I think everybody agrees that there is plenty of space.,88,,
890,0.97,5250.111,5257.285,I do think that a conversation needs to be had.,88,,
891,0.97,5257.285,5257.585,Thank you.,88,,
892,0.97,5257.585,5275.47,"We are in the process, again, with director Kim's skillful leadership to execute what would be the arrangement by which the authority interact on land.",89,,
893,0.97,5275.47,5283.511,"Part of it is, I largely stay away from it until I am able to say something honest.",89,,
894,0.97,5283.511,5289.117,I'm happy to be whatever part of the can conversation it can be.,89,,
895,0.97,5289.117,5294.389,We have a contract mechanism as soon as possible.,89,,
896,0.97,5294.389,5294.789,Excellent.,90,,
897,0.97,5294.789,5300.261,There's always one more detail that Councilmember Herbold notices.,90,,
898,0.97,5300.261,5302.73,That the staple of the committee.,90,,
899,0.97,5302.73,5303.164,That's great.,90,,
900,0.97,5303.164,5320.181,Why don't we go forward to some of the other things like the joint concept that King County and the city are investing in and how that planning is looking at this stage.,90,,
901,0.97,5320.181,5328.289,At that point I don't have any additional questions and I'm happy to open it up to more folks and close out the presentation.,90,,
902,0.97,5328.289,5330.425,"I will turn it back over to you, Marc.",90,,
903,0.97,5330.425,5330.825,Sure.,91,,
904,0.97,5330.825,5335.963,"Dr. Florez, another person that I talked to daily.",91,,
905,0.97,5335.963,5349.877,"For the Rector, the director of D.C. Hs.",91,,
906,0.97,5349.877,5350.211,I apologize.,91,,
907,0.97,5350.211,5354.982,I keep doing this because there's something in my eye and I'm trying not to rub my eye while I present to you all.,91,,
908,0.97,5354.982,5355.817,That's what's happening.,91,,
909,0.97,5355.817,5374.502,"We are continuing to have a conversation about Scoping the site and making sure we are being really clear about, frankly, making sure we are making it a supportive campus and not just a dumping a bunch of stuff.",91,,
910,0.97,5374.502,5398.159,"That is in relationship to the physical assets and all of the work the county has indicated they will take on in order to build up the Thomas sorry, I'm baking the other operational needs in order to turn stuff on.",91,,
911,0.97,5398.159,5416.978,We are having conversations on this service provision side in relationship to the space that's already there and then looking at which building we think has some sort of performance for folks to go in.,91,,
912,0.97,5416.978,5422.016,And the planning level that we are in now is actually quite programmatic.,91,,
913,0.97,5422.016,5426.554,"We are talking about, what is the link to stay?",91,,
914,0.97,5426.554,5427.388,What is the staffing model?,91,,
915,0.97,5427.388,5434.095,We are in that space.,91,,
916,0.97,5434.095,5437.565,"My understanding, process wise, I don't want to speak for my colleagues at the county.",91,,
917,0.97,5437.565,5446.607,I believe the vehicle by which the site Securement and expansion happens needs to be processed by their counsel.,91,,
918,0.97,5446.607,5454.348,I am not aware of that having happened yet.,91,,
919,0.97,5454.348,5461.088,"We will get into citing things and Ramping up on things once that has been Legislatively approved across the street, so to speak.",91,,
920,0.97,5461.088,5468.262,But at the Department level we are in the program planning phase.,91,,
921,0.97,5468.262,5469.23,Okay.,92,,
922,0.97,5469.23,5477.004,Any additional comments on that?,92,,
923,0.97,5477.004,5478.906,Thank you.,93,,
924,0.97,5478.906,5482.777,I hope you are feeling better.,93,,
925,0.97,5482.777,5485.479,"Director Dones, it's good to see you.",93,,
926,0.97,5485.479,5486.948,I appreciate the conversation here today.,93,,
927,0.97,5486.948,5488.983,Thank you very much Mr. chair.,93,,
928,0.97,5488.983,5498.926,I think you for the notes on the presentation that was provided to the inflammation committee.,93,,
929,0.97,5498.926,5506.634,Congratulations to the passing in the implementation board and the governing board and I appreciate you noting the ongoing conversations with King County.,93,,
930,0.97,5506.634,5533.427,"As we talked about in the implementation board, and then this morning we happened to discuss in relation to the implementation of the Seattle rescue plan, the ways in which Seattle is trying to make sure we are being both good partners with the regional home assist in the long-term, but especially in the initial creation of the Rha . We are taking our role very seriously.",93,,
931,0.97,5533.427,5541.869,"I want to use this opportunity again to dispel any misunderstandings that are out there about Seattle not doing its part, or treating this as business as usual.",93,,
932,0.97,5541.869,5543.271,I will use the percentage of 68%.,93,,
933,0.97,5543.271,5550.645,I think our percentage is 68% of the $170 million budget that we have contributed to that.,93,,
934,0.97,5550.645,5551.779,And on the implementation board.,93,,
935,0.97,5551.779,5562.59,I'm not saying that to brag but I'm saying it to really NOTE the things that we are doing to take this role very seriously.,93,,
936,0.97,5562.59,5564.125,Both in the budget and policy commitments.,93,,
937,0.97,5564.125,5568.963,I hope that funding Diversifies in the future.,93,,
938,0.97,5568.963,5571.332,We will see additional Buy-In or pay into supporting the system.,93,,
939,0.97,5571.332,5572.967,We very much have taken this seriously.,93,,
940,0.97,5572.967,5598.793,"And I think the comments specific to the shelter and the ongoing discussions that you're having there again to dispel any misunderstandings or misinformation that's out there, I really appreciate the directors roles in coordinating to make sure this is evolving into a site that can have multiple services on one location.",93,,
941,0.97,5598.793,5617.745,"And when we are in the midst of the budget and we asked Kelly how quickly we can work to meet the intent for the vision that was outlined initially, the hail Mary kind of a vision of what we wanted to accomplish for the shelter.",93,,
942,0.97,5617.745,5622.883,"We, as a city, asked to contribute $5 million to match their $5 million.",93,,
943,0.97,5622.883,5626.32,We did exactly that.,93,,
944,0.97,5626.32,5627.688,We have not shortchanged the effort.,93,,
945,0.97,5627.688,5637.698,I think that the high area of interest for all Council members to see that shelter come to fruition and all of the other amenities that you are able to put on site.,93,,
946,0.97,5637.698,5640.368,"Just using this as an opportunity to say, thank you for the partnership.",93,,
947,0.97,5640.368,5645.272,The way in which Seattle and especially our budget is hoping to support Rha.,93,,
948,0.97,5645.272,5657.151,"I know that director Dones and I will continue to have conversations as the budget chair about providing elements added to the budget, as we did in last year's budget.",93,,
949,0.97,5657.151,5667.061,"So every word, specifically that I can remember, that we added in the budget for 2022, were worked Shopped together.",93,,
950,0.97,5667.061,5668.629,That is the partnership role as well.,93,,
951,0.97,5668.629,5672.733,"Director Dones, I know you are Ceo Dones.",93,,
952,0.97,5672.733,5676.17,I just say director Dones because it has a nice ring to it.,93,,
953,0.97,5676.17,5688.282,"If you could also share for us, I'm sorry Mr. chair, I believe I'm jumping in inappropriately because I'm Dovetailing on the last question you asked about the shelter.",93,,
954,0.97,5688.282,5693.587,It's fine.,94,,
955,0.97,5693.587,5695.156,Go ahead.,94,,
956,0.97,5695.156,5695.489,Thank you.,94,,
957,0.97,5695.489,5695.956,Very briefly.,95,,
958,0.97,5695.956,5721.882,"At some point could you tell us more about what you think the process will be for this year, given that you are going to start your budget conversations in April, and the ways in which we, as a counsel, can get regular updates and be part of the conversation and have reciprocal feedback before we get to those budget processes so that we can stay in tune and up-to-date on how this conversation is going and what that role for the Council looks like.",95,,
959,0.97,5721.882,5722.149,Sure.,96,,
960,0.97,5722.149,5723.951,Thank you for the well wishes on my health.,96,,
961,0.97,5723.951,5725.786,"For the record, I came down with Covid.",96,,
962,0.97,5725.786,5726.587,I mostly fine.,96,,
963,0.97,5726.587,5730.291,I seem to have a headache that won't go away.,96,,
964,0.97,5730.291,5733.594,Maybe I'm just a person who has a headache now.,96,,
965,0.97,5733.594,5744.071,I'm happy to be here today.,96,,
966,0.97,5744.638,5746.54,I am leaning on our history Councilmember.,96,,
967,0.97,5746.54,5753.848,You know that my preference is for the broad community engagement and how anything is done.,96,,
968,0.97,5753.848,5754.215,Right?,96,,
969,0.97,5754.215,5755.649,That's what democracy is supposed to be.,96,,
970,0.97,5755.649,5766.56,"Our budget process, we are like looking at being connected to the system very deeply.",96,,
971,0.97,5766.56,5785.98,"When we are asking the provider community and the lived experience community and the whole community to be part of this work that is ending homelessness, that should be a community conversation that community conversation about what the work is should then yield the budget.",96,,
972,0.97,5785.98,5800.06,"That's the process that we are, fingers crossed, all things Covid sort of working in our favor, looking to begin really in earnest in February.",96,,
973,0.97,5800.06,5806.1,Hopefully not too far into February.,96,,
974,0.97,5806.1,5809.837,"That would, in many ways, Intel very similar methodology to how we design the authority.",96,,
975,0.97,5809.837,5818.312,"But frankly, more robust.",96,,
976,0.97,5818.312,5819.079,A lot of community workshops.,96,,
977,0.97,5819.079,5820.281,A lot of community listening.,96,,
978,0.97,5820.281,5824.585,"A lot of connecting with people who are on sheltered and saying, what can we do better here?",96,,
979,0.97,5824.585,5829.39,"In keeping with our commitment to be regional, the part that I really want to be clear about doing better is going more places.",96,,
980,0.97,5829.39,5829.623,Right?,96,,
981,0.97,5829.623,5833.828,Really making sure that we are hearing from everybody.,96,,
982,0.97,5833.828,5842.837,"And the updates that you all would receive on that process along the way would be, this is what we are hearing.",96,,
983,0.97,5842.837,5852.546,This is what we think the request might turn into if what we hear stays consistent.,96,,
984,0.97,5852.546,5867.595,"Similarly, again, as we work to design the authority, I understand all of the regional Lectives as Stakeholders . We have engaged and asked, what is the work?",96,,
985,0.97,5867.595,5868.596,What does success look like?,96,,
986,0.97,5868.596,5871.298,How do we know it's happening?,96,,
987,0.97,5871.298,5886.614,"We are looking forward to having some of those conversations with you in the committee, and other Venues, come to one of the community forms that we are hopefully able to set up in a Covid Safeway.",96,,
988,0.97,5886.614,5889.516,"That, I think, is how our team is imagining that process unfold over the spring.",96,,
989,0.97,5889.516,5899.193,"And then yielding a budget ask that is in relationship, sort of concept to dollar.",96,,
990,0.97,5899.193,5899.793,The way forward.,96,,
991,0.97,5899.793,5908.636,I also think it is the only way that a true transformation happens.,96,,
992,0.97,5908.636,5916.176,"We all say, this is where we are going and this is why we are headed there and this is what it was going to be when we succeed or fail.",96,,
993,0.97,5916.176,5929.156,"To me and our team it is just really critical that we live into the highest value placed, or highest hope I should say, placed in his agency.",96,,
994,0.97,5929.156,5934.828,That it doesn't become a place for Fiats.,96,,
995,0.97,5934.828,5935.796,This is what we decided.,96,,
996,0.97,5935.796,5942.87,But actually becomes the nexus point for the conversation we need to have to end homelessness.,96,,
997,0.97,5942.87,5945.272,That's my hope for that process.,96,,
998,0.97,5945.272,5952.446,"I'm very open, of course, and going back to how we set up the authority.",96,,
999,0.97,5952.446,5964.425,"We met with members of the Committee on homelessness, then, monthly or every other week at some point.",96,,
1000,0.97,5964.425,5973.467,We are happy to do that to make sure you are all getting the insight into how those conversations are unfolding.,96,,
1001,0.97,5973.467,5982.242,"Again, no hail Mary pass at the end.",96,,
1002,0.97,5982.242,5990.15,Thank you for that.,97,,
1003,0.97,5990.15,5992.519,I know Councilmember Herbold asked a question.,97,,
1004,0.97,5992.519,5998.258,Then I will open it up if there is anybody else who wants to get into the Queue and do the little hand racing.,97,,
1005,0.97,5998.258,5998.926,"Councilmember Herbold, to you.",97,,
1006,0.97,5998.926,6009.436,I have a question that I think we could maybe use some Tagteam partnership in answering.,98,,
1007,0.97,6009.436,6014.007,Both from the city and from Ceo Dones.,98,,
1008,0.97,6014.007,6032.793,It's a follow-up on a question that I asked in a governing committee meeting around my interest in preserving the outreach contract' geographic focus.,98,,
1009,0.97,6032.793,6048.809,"When they transferred over from the city over to the regional authority, there was some Intentionality around having a geographic focus in different parts of the city.",98,,
1010,0.97,6048.809,6051.445,That's something that came through our budget process.,98,,
1011,0.97,6051.445,6072.166,"You, at that time, Ceo Dones, expressed a willingness and told me I could expect that geographic focus would be preserved.",98,,
1012,0.97,6072.166,6094.488,"I want to just check in on the outreach contract side with you, and then on the side with deputy Mayor Washington about how best I can access those services and help my constituents access those services.",98,,
1013,0.97,6094.488,6104.598,"Right now, for the outreach contract, I will tell you what I have been doing and you let me know, Ceo Dones, if that's the way to keep doing it.",98,,
1014,0.97,6104.598,6133.894,We have relationships with our designated reach workers in district 1. we reach out to them when we are notified by a member of the public or we observe ourselves focused on living on sheltered . a person will go out and do an assessment and try to connect people with services.,98,,
1015,0.97,6133.894,6167.294,"It feels like a little bit of a funny way to deal with it because I'm not in a position where I can manage the amount of work that I am sending one of these wonderful people, who are dedicated to District 1. on the hope team side, deputy Mayor Washington, people contact the city about a location that they are wondering whether or not it should be assessed for our hope team engagement.",98,,
1016,0.97,6167.294,6172.9,And assessed as to whether or not it should be considered a high priority location or not.,98,,
1017,0.97,6172.9,6194.488,I try to do everything I can to manage people's expectations and make sure people understand the sheer number of locations of people that are living outside together in a community to maintain a level of safety and community.,98,,
1018,0.97,6194.488,6211.104,"And explained that the city has a process of identifying what the High-Priority locations are within an assessment of the risks to the people living on sheltered, as well as impacts to the community.",98,,
1019,0.97,6211.104,6219.112,"We have to do that assessment, also with an assessment of whether or not we have locations for people to go.",98,,
1020,0.97,6219.112,6237.598,"The problem is, when I share that information with people and give them the only method that I have for them to notify the city, which is the community service Bureau information.",98,,
1021,0.97,6237.598,6245.138,"People don't ever hear back from anybody about, yes, we have gone out and done this assessment.",98,,
1022,0.97,6245.138,6248.375,"Sorry, you are 167 on a list of 200 places.",98,,
1023,0.97,6248.375,6256.55,It's very difficult for me to manage people's expectations in a way that is helpful for all of us.,98,,
1024,0.97,6256.55,6264.791,And also gives people really good senses of the sheer Largeness and demand on our system.,98,,
1025,0.97,6264.791,6267.394,What a timely question.,99,,
1026,0.97,6267.394,6268.028,Isn't it really timely?,99,,
1027,0.97,6268.028,6270.297,It's so good.,100,,
1028,0.97,6270.297,6294.721,"One of the things I would say, because I just had a moment, the two times that I worked and have been asked to work on homelessness, both of those times I was brought into a process in the middle or towards the end where habits have been formed, structures have been built, opinions were solidified.",101,,
1029,0.97,6294.721,6301.094,I was maintaining most of the time.,101,,
1030,0.97,6301.094,6321.448,"Never, until Mayor Harrell came into office, was a there at the beginning with a focused mandate on homelessness housing and the freedom to be transparent and in partnership with both counsel and community at the level that the Mayor is committed to.",101,,
1031,0.97,6321.448,6331.692,"When I get done, I have been asking myself those same questions, Councilmember Herbold.",101,,
1032,0.97,6331.692,6333.76,I have never been in charge of any one thing.,101,,
1033,0.97,6333.76,6345.872,So starting at the beginning of an administration with a group of people who are also curious and open to solutions makes a world of difference.,101,,
1034,0.97,6345.872,6349.81,"I brought together all the city departments, the directors and their number twos, to meetings that were very long.",101,,
1035,0.97,6349.81,6352.679,Marc Dones was present.,101,,
1036,0.97,6352.679,6355.782,How does your Department know there is a problem?,101,,
1037,0.97,6355.782,6363.423,"Whether it is a car, Rv, tent, or something.",101,,
1038,0.97,6363.423,6364.424,And then how do you Loopback?,101,,
1039,0.97,6364.424,6366.693,How do you determine which one you do first?,101,,
1040,0.97,6366.693,6369.763,Like all of the questions that you just asked.,101,,
1041,0.97,6369.763,6374.368,"You will not be surprised to hear, each Department does it differently.",101,,
1042,0.97,6374.368,6376.303,Each Department has a different spreadsheet.,101,,
1043,0.97,6376.303,6390.751,The income generating departments have a very sophisticated databases and often times are more able to close the Loop with constituents and the human servicing side of the House does not.,101,,
1044,0.97,6390.751,6399.693,"They just had hundreds and hundreds of Emails, which as you know, muttering this level of issues does not yield high customer service.",101,,
1045,0.97,6399.693,6400.327,That is one.,101,,
1046,0.97,6400.327,6403.797,We are really clear.,101,,
1047,0.97,6403.797,6409.97,"Two, a mandate from the Mayor to build a system.",101,,
1048,0.97,6409.97,6416.109,A system that really demonstrates our models of Seattle.,101,,
1049,0.97,6416.109,6416.91,We can respond to people.,101,,
1050,0.97,6416.91,6418.545,It's heartbreaking to me.,101,,
1051,0.97,6418.545,6424.684,I have hundreds of Emails a day.,101,,
1052,0.97,6424.684,6425.519,It just breaks my heart.,101,,
1053,0.97,6425.519,6429.623,There should be one place where people go.,101,,
1054,0.97,6429.623,6432.893,They go a place or send an Email to a place.,101,,
1055,0.97,6432.893,6433.293,Preferably both.,101,,
1056,0.97,6433.293,6439.866,They can hear a clear answer as to being heard.,101,,
1057,0.97,6439.866,6444.538,Someone has to Prioritize it.,101,,
1058,0.97,6444.538,6448.875,That's where Marc and director Kim and a large group of people have been working for two months.,101,,
1059,0.97,6448.875,6463.623,"They have a planning meeting tomorrow because Marc and Donna and the whole team are working collectively, with outreach, to say, how do we Prioritize with one, two, and three?",101,,
1060,0.97,6463.623,6467.16,And where do we focus on our Rsources?,101,,
1061,0.97,6467.16,6467.594,I'm super excited.,101,,
1062,0.97,6467.594,6490.45,"I actually think, and a long time, I can see that we can get our hands around this because there are willing participants in city Council, the Mayor's office with Marc, the outreach providers are excited to be brought in at the front end and asked for their opinion.",101,,
1063,0.97,6490.45,6491.284,It feels very hopeful.,101,,
1064,0.97,6491.284,6493.753,I will say that.,101,,
1065,0.97,6493.753,6494.588,We've got to move fast.,101,,
1066,0.97,6494.588,6505.799,"We don't have six months . When I say customer service, I consider our on sheltered neighbors customers as well.",101,,
1067,0.97,6505.799,6510.337,That gets us access to the things they need.,101,,
1068,0.97,6510.337,6511.137,I'm just very hopeful.,101,,
1069,0.97,6511.137,6513.24,I will pass it over to Ceo Dones.,101,,
1070,0.97,6513.24,6520.38,"Thank you for that, Councilmember Mosqueda.",101,,
1071,0.97,6520.38,6521.214,And director Dones as well.,101,,
1072,0.97,6521.214,6530.59,"I don't care if you call me Marc, even in this formal setting I think that is fine.",102,,
1073,0.97,6530.59,6533.627,I will say that I'm also really excited.,102,,
1074,0.97,6533.627,6548.608,"I'm very grateful that deputy Mayor Washington is in the position she is in, she has done the work that she has done.",102,,
1075,0.97,6548.608,6549.843,She has been an outreach worker.,102,,
1076,0.97,6549.843,6555.315,She has worked with getting involved with young people.,102,,
1077,0.97,6555.315,6558.018,She has done the administrative work at Jsd and is now deputy Mayor.,102,,
1078,0.97,6558.018,6564.591,And the same way director Kim has been a provider for many years.,102,,
1079,0.97,6564.591,6568.094,This is game changing for the reality check that is often necessary in the conversation.,102,,
1080,0.97,6568.094,6571.531,I am frequently the one that has to bring that up.,102,,
1081,0.97,6571.531,6578.538,I'm really grateful for their leadership.,102,,
1082,0.97,6578.538,6594.321,"The thing that leapt out to me, first and foremost, we have to be able to tell people where on the Q this is in relationship to the resources that we have.",102,,
1083,0.97,6594.321,6606.833,"To deputy Mayor Washington's point, I want to say it was in October that we begin to convene a group that the deputy Mayor is describing.",102,,
1084,0.97,6606.833,6609.536,We have to get this right and we have to get it right fast.,102,,
1085,0.97,6609.536,6618.178,When we get the keys we have to be able to then begin to implement something that makes sense.,102,,
1086,0.97,6618.178,6636.563,"I have really high faith that our community is smart enough and passionate enough and cares enough about our on sheltered neighbors that if we, as administrators, are able to say to them that this is why this is, they can actually get that and be okay with it.",102,,
1087,0.97,6636.563,6636.796,Right?,102,,
1088,0.97,6636.796,6641.368,It is the fact that it feels like Kafka that is not okay.,102,,
1089,0.97,6641.368,6651.678,It is this abysmal experience for both our on sheltered neighbors and our house neighbors to try to interact with the service streams we deploy here.,102,,
1090,0.97,6651.678,6656.383,"That is the thing that I think the deputy Mayor and I are super aligned on fixing, and fixing fast.",102,,
1091,0.97,6656.383,6666.393,"You have my personal commitment that on our side of the authority, that is one of my projects.",102,,
1092,0.97,6666.393,6670.43,"So if you want to know how it's going, feel free to call me, text me, bring me back here.",102,,
1093,0.97,6670.43,6672.632,I'm more than happy to speak about it.,102,,
1094,0.97,6672.632,6689.382,"The other thing, in terms of Accessing the existing resource pool as it stands, is our approach to that while we are in this flux moment has been to lean way in.",102,,
1095,0.97,6689.382,6700.894,"Rather than the response of saying, thanks for your call Councilman Herbold, please direct that to come later.",102,,
1096,0.97,6700.894,6707.333,"For example, there was a conversation that another Councilmember called about in an encampment.",102,,
1097,0.97,6707.333,6709.235,Deputy Mayor Washington and I went.,102,,
1098,0.97,6709.235,6711.204,"We are like, what's going on?",102,,
1099,0.97,6711.204,6715.942,Tell us what is happening.,102,,
1100,0.97,6715.942,6716.576,The staff were there.,102,,
1101,0.97,6716.576,6726.82,I'm meeting with them again on Friday to talk about the strategies for the encampment and how the authority resources can be positioned to support what strategy they want to use.,102,,
1102,0.97,6726.82,6752.846,We are in the interim space using our capacity to be physically present in the conversation and make sure the Resourcing that the providers are receiving is in alignment with what they feel is the right thing to do.,102,,
1103,0.97,6756.85,6758.752,We can also serve as the people closing loop.,102,,
1104,0.97,6758.752,6760.92,Who can report back to you or report to the constituents?,102,,
1105,0.97,6760.92,6762.956,I think everybody knows I have been super clear.,102,,
1106,0.97,6762.956,6763.823,I will go whatever.,102,,
1107,0.97,6763.823,6768.128,I have done some rotary clip conversations because I think it's a great idea when we have this level of Kafka nonsense.,102,,
1108,0.97,6768.128,6779.873,"If you are experiencing or hearing from your constituents that they need to know why a thing is the way it is, I'm more than happy and my team is more than happy to go and talk to people about what the current state is, what we are trying to do, listen to the concerns they have.",102,,
1109,0.97,6779.873,6797.49,"If there are specific things that they want to say, like this encampment that we don't want to have a high level conversation about but a tactical conversation, we can support that as well.",102,,
1110,0.97,6797.49,6799.559,"We will follow up on that request, Marc.",103,,
1111,0.97,6799.559,6800.894,Thank you for putting that forward.,103,,
1112,0.97,6800.894,6801.394,Councilmember Herbold.,103,,
1113,0.97,6801.394,6807.801,"I just want to get real, real Nitty-Gritty here.",104,,
1114,0.97,6807.801,6810.97,I'm not going to name the individual.,104,,
1115,0.97,6810.97,6830.156,"Currently we have a person who does work in district 1. when we get a constituent contacting us about a location where there is anything from one tent to a dozen tents, we contact this person.",104,,
1116,0.97,6830.156,6841.034,Give them the location and are told that they can go out and engage with the folks who are living on sheltered at that location.,104,,
1117,0.97,6841.034,6849.042,Would it be useful to start copying?,104,,
1118,0.97,6849.042,6858.751,The reason why I am uncomfortable with this is I feel like I'm referring a lot of stuff around district 1 to this one person.,104,,
1119,0.97,6858.751,6875.768,Given that you are managing the contracts I think it might be useful for somebody else to be doing an assessment of whether or not we are Saddling this one worker with too much work.,104,,
1120,0.97,6875.768,6876.836,I'm positive we are.,105,,
1121,0.97,6876.836,6877.837,Feel free to CC me.,105,,
1122,0.97,6877.837,6878.404,Thank you.,106,,
1123,0.97,6878.404,6879.272,Thank you so much.,106,,
1124,0.97,6879.272,6880.673,No worries.,107,,
1125,0.97,6880.673,6882.775,Councilmember Mosqueda?,108,,
1126,0.97,6882.775,6886.412,Thank you so much.,109,,
1127,0.97,6886.412,6890.917,My question is similar to Councilmember Herbold's.,109,,
1128,0.97,6890.917,6897.09,What do we do when folks call us or we also see an area in need of assistance?,109,,
1129,0.97,6897.09,6900.193,I'm not quite sure I understand what the process should be.,109,,
1130,0.97,6900.193,6915.441,Perhaps this should also be clear for folks to provide assistance as well.,109,,
1131,0.97,6915.441,6919.979,Remind me if there is a Follow- up Email that says these are the two or three people you need to contact.,109,,
1132,0.97,6919.979,6925.118,"Or if there is a place we should be referring people, I'm happy to have that information shared if that is a public resource as well.",109,,
1133,0.97,6925.118,6926.653,I will send a follow-up Email.,110,,
1134,0.97,6926.653,6932.659,"I would say we are in process of moving from what is now, which is there is no one place.",110,,
1135,0.97,6932.659,6933.593,People are just Emailing everybody.,110,,
1136,0.97,6933.593,6934.093,"You, me, Marc.",110,,
1137,0.97,6934.093,6935.194,They just want help.,110,,
1138,0.97,6935.194,6937.263,They are just Emailing folks.,110,,
1139,0.97,6937.263,6944.203,We are trying to stand up very quickly.,110,,
1140,0.97,6944.203,6947.473,"One place, Councilmember Mosqueda, I can say to all of you and the general public.",110,,
1141,0.97,6947.473,6953.212,"If you see something, the find it, fix it App was designed for some of it.",110,,
1142,0.97,6953.212,6956.916,It's not working because FAS staff worked really hard.,110,,
1143,0.97,6956.916,6968.194,They get an Email and they just Email the request to the appropriate Department and that it falls into that Department's process but there is no Loopback to close.,110,,
1144,0.97,6968.194,6974.334,We are working fast to create one place where people will get noticed in for an acknowledgment of their Email.,110,,
1145,0.97,6974.334,6980.673,Then there will be some kind of loop closed.,110,,
1146,0.97,6980.673,6981.207,Basic customer service.,110,,
1147,0.97,6981.207,6983.142,I think we are talking about basic customer service.,110,,
1148,0.97,6983.142,6985.812,In the interim I will send you with Marc.,110,,
1149,0.97,6985.812,6988.715,We will work together on where to send the things in the interim.,110,,
1150,0.97,6988.715,6996.889,Knowing that it is Clunky but we are actively looking for a very organized way to deal with these requests.,110,,
1151,0.97,6996.889,6997.19,Right.,111,,
1152,0.97,6997.19,7001.227,The other thing I would lift up his to really drill down on that leg.,111,,
1153,0.97,7001.227,7003.896,We are Transitioning.,111,,
1154,0.97,7003.896,7015.708,We are actively in that process of transition.,111,,
1155,0.97,7015.708,7018.478,"What we are, and deputy Mayor you can correct me if I am wrong.",111,,
1156,0.97,7018.478,7020.079,I see this in all of the meetings.,111,,
1157,0.97,7020.079,7021.381,We are just doing it ourselves.,111,,
1158,0.97,7021.381,7032.759,"Again, we are just going to the things that the community needs us to be at so that they can see that they are there and that there is some follow-up and we take personal responsibility for what that follow-up is.",111,,
1159,0.97,7032.759,7036.662,"I think I heard something in your question, Councilman Mosqueda.",111,,
1160,0.97,7036.662,7042.969,It's a very much connected to what deputy Mayor Washington has connected.,111,,
1161,0.97,7042.969,7047.373,The issues that people reach out about are not all authority things.,111,,
1162,0.97,7047.373,7057.483,"They are not all like, there's this question, is it for Donna at parks?",111,,
1163,0.97,7057.483,7058.785,The question is about trash mitigation.,111,,
1164,0.97,7058.785,7064.791,Is it for the Rv remediation team?,111,,
1165,0.97,7064.791,7068.261,Who is it for?,111,,
1166,0.97,7068.261,7070.93,That is one of the key barriers to success right now.,111,,
1167,0.97,7070.93,7079.505,And the Triaging mechanism is not there if we are being totally candid.,111,,
1168,0.97,7079.505,7081.04,It's not there the way it should be.,111,,
1169,0.97,7081.04,7083.776,I think I'm out on a limb.,111,,
1170,0.97,7083.776,7086.813,"You just said that I think, deputy Mayor.",111,,
1171,0.97,7086.813,7099.792,"We are in acknowledgment of that problem and clear about it needing to be fixed, not in a year but in this quarter.",111,,
1172,0.97,7099.792,7105.465,Mayor Harrell asked me to convene all of the directors yesterday.,112,,
1173,0.97,7105.465,7107.2,"He basically said to them, this is one Seattle.",112,,
1174,0.97,7107.2,7110.903,We are going to address this issue as a team.,112,,
1175,0.97,7110.903,7121.547,I have asked my staff to streamline this process so that we can provide the highest customer service to the folks in our community.,112,,
1176,0.97,7121.547,7134.293,It was also helpful to have that direction from the Mayor.,112,,
1177,0.97,7137.13,7139.899,"Discussion and thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",112,,
1178,0.97,7139.899,7148.441,This service delivery discussion we just had is the number one frustration that our office receives.,112,,
1179,0.97,7148.441,7168.961,"I would say my office and my staff and me personally spend two-thirds of our work time trying to coordinate tactical interventions for encampment related issues . You know, being in a position it is easier to navigate and to Cue up, I am looking forward to this.",112,,
1180,0.97,7168.961,7172.798,This committee will be a big partner in helping to get this work accomplished.,112,,
1181,0.97,7172.798,7180.573,I really appreciate the shared priority there.,112,,
1182,0.97,7180.573,7184.544,"Mayor Washington, we are extremely excited for you to build something from the ground up that works.",112,,
1183,0.97,7184.544,7198.357,"Councilmember Mosqueda, one more question on this and I want to close off this conversation and go to our Seattle public library's presentation.",112,,
1184,0.97,7198.357,7200.259,"I will let you close it out, Councilmember Mosqueda.",112,,
1185,0.97,7200.259,7206.933,Thank you.,113,,
1186,0.97,7206.933,7216.042,"I feel we should say again and reiterate to folks watching this when we are talking about a place to call both from the Rha, executive, and legislative branch, we are talking about services.",113,,
1187,0.97,7216.042,7221.981,"It could be hygiene services, case management, housing connection here it could be helping to make sure folks have health and safety needs met.",113,,
1188,0.97,7221.981,7226.552,The full array . I am seeing nods from folks in zoom here.,113,,
1189,0.97,7226.552,7236.796,"Folks, understand why that number is important and it is not for one type of service only.",113,,
1190,0.97,7236.796,7238.864,We want to make sure everyone is getting their needs met.,113,,
1191,0.97,7238.864,7257.717,"I have to ask because we talked about this this morning and I know this is an area that comes as a carryover from conversations from the previous meeting as well, we are thankful that the dollars are being handed over to Rha without an update from Julie Daly this morning in the budget committee about that.",113,,
1192,0.97,7257.717,7270.496,Are there any additional details you can share with us on the creation of the Rbc services that Councilmember Herbold has added to?,113,,
1193,0.97,7270.496,7273.766,In addition to the tiny House village dollars passed from the state legislator.,113,,
1194,0.97,7273.766,7274.967,Yes.,114,,
1195,0.97,7274.967,7276.669,Two part answer.,114,,
1196,0.97,7276.669,7293.286,"One, more Ted Noah to your comment which is just to be clear for everyone watching, I took this job because I believe we can House people . I don't believe we can shove people around aimlessly.",114,,
1197,0.97,7293.286,7294.487,That is not a solution.,114,,
1198,0.97,7294.487,7298.958,The conversation we are having is not about you can't be here.,114,,
1199,0.97,7298.958,7306.766,"I want to make that very clear from my perspective, from the agency's perspective.",114,,
1200,0.97,7306.766,7313.305,That is the work we signed up to do and we intended to do in collaboration with Mayor Washington.,114,,
1201,0.97,7313.305,7318.844,I don't want that to be misconstrued as the authority wants a Hotline.,114,,
1202,0.97,7318.844,7324.583,Not what we aim to do.,114,,
1203,0.97,7324.583,7343.235,"On the American rescue act plan dollars American rescue plan act dollars, the state Legislature money I can speak to first and that is the easiest to dispense with.",114,,
1204,0.97,7343.235,7348.407,It won't be activated until a site is secured.,114,,
1205,0.97,7348.407,7350.276,We anticipate utilizing it.,114,,
1206,0.97,7350.276,7357.65,"You know, once the appropriate site is secured . Then it becomes eligible for transfer.",114,,
1207,0.97,7357.65,7373.733,That is my understanding per interim director Tingley and our mutual budget teams . The Timeline to that transfer is in relationship to the successful closing that the authority is running right now.,114,,
1208,0.97,7373.733,7386.078,I don't anticipate that there should be any significant issues there.,114,,
1209,0.97,7386.078,7387.546,I am racking my memory right now.,114,,
1210,0.97,7387.546,7388.814,I don't anticipate any significant issues.,114,,
1211,0.97,7388.814,7423.883,"I had conversations with Peter Lynn about, you know, potential language that was not clear and making sure that a potential bidder new what was true and what was not true . My hope is that doesn't radically shift the Timeline as with any Nofa has to be posted in every one has to see what the change was.",114,,
1212,0.97,7423.883,7430.99,"We are--or I should say I am because I don't want to speak for Peter, but I am confident in Peter's ability to make sure that moves with all due haste.",114,,
1213,0.97,7430.99,7440.9,"And then the parking stuff, sorry, it is enough money to safe parking, so thank you.",114,,
1214,0.97,7440.9,7455.147,"Honestly parking stuff, I think, you know, obviously thinking about whether or not some of the investments can be a potential home for some of that work.",114,,
1215,0.97,7455.147,7491.116,"I am also trying to look at some of our investments Countywide and how we might marry some things that are Operant and could provide a combination of safe parking and other service supports and which sites have a frankly the parking capacity to do that . My hope is that--and of course we have our vehicle Residency working group and that has, you know, been a core component of our launch work.",114,,
1216,0.97,7491.116,7503.162,My hope is we should be in a place to get that Nofa and our broad new Nofa out the door I hope by the second week of February.,114,,
1217,0.97,7503.162,7506.298,That might be a tight turnaround time with where we are with staffing.,114,,
1218,0.97,7506.298,7526.685,"In candor, we all know our system is facing Contractions and spaces as we Pivoted away from Congregant models and work to better serve . The need to move quickly is not lost on our team.",114,,
1219,0.97,7526.685,7528.988,It is very Straightforwardly where we are in the staffing Ramp-Up.,114,,
1220,0.97,7528.988,7530.523,We are moving as quick as we can.,114,,
1221,0.97,7530.523,7531.757,Thank you so much.,115,,
1222,0.97,7531.757,7539.064,I think that is a good place to end at this point.,115,,
1223,0.97,7539.064,7555.314,"I would say going forward, this Committee is scheduled to meet twice a month and we may not always have a homelessness update, but we would always like to get updates from the authority and the Mayor's office on kind of those high- level items, right?",115,,
1224,0.97,7555.314,7556.682,Check in every meeting.,115,,
1225,0.97,7556.682,7574.199,"Going forward, just expectation setting here and speaking mostly for myself, but I think I am partially speaking for my colleagues that, you know, just laying it out in terms of what the next step is.",115,,
1226,0.97,7574.199,7596.522,"As long as we are moving forward and we are meeting our goals, and as long as we can communicate that as part of this philosophy of having a unified city government working on this together, and unified region under your leadership, mark, we are fine communicating that as long as progress is being made.",115,,
1227,0.97,7596.522,7606.098,Part of the frustration is having community meetings where the Council is appropriating money for things and it wasn't always clear how we were moving along and what the next goal was.,115,,
1228,0.97,7606.098,7623.415,"As long as we have routine public check INS, this Council will continue to be very supportive of this work and look forward to doing what we can to assist moving forward and knock hurdles down if it is within our power.",115,,
1229,0.97,7623.415,7643.836,Also continuing to think of us as a resource to complete this work be at signaling problem spots the constituents are sending us or shoring up regulation waivers or funding that needs to be moved around to support certain priorities.,115,,
1230,0.97,7643.836,7658.517,"You know, we share the urgency with the administration and appreciate earlier in this meeting Mayor Harrell and hearing his sense of urgency.",115,,
1231,0.97,7658.517,7662.988,This was a very good beginning session to this.,115,,
1232,0.97,7662.988,7680.639,"We are in the middle of week three of the Harrell administration . a lot of stuff is coming together and hopefully in two weeks, we can talk a little bit more about some more of this work . I do want to acknowledge that it has been great to start off.",115,,
1233,0.97,7680.639,7693.318,Thank you for joining us and congratulations on your role as part of the authority . I appreciate you coming by.,115,,
1234,0.97,7693.318,7702.795,"With that, I think we can move on, Mr. Clark, to the patient Seattle public library's team.",115,,
1235,0.97,7702.795,7720.646,"I want to thank director Kim, deputy Mayor Washington, Mayor Harrell for their presentation and we can pivot to agenda item 2. we did introduce that panel earlier . look, there we go.",115,,
1236,0.97,7720.646,7724.917,They are coming back on.,115,,
1237,0.97,7724.917,7743.402,"Tom, without any further delay and just as a quick reminder, this is the initial presentation on Council bill 120258, acceptance of sites in Georgetown for the Seattle public libraries . Tom, I will hand it over to you.",115,,
1238,0.97,7743.402,7752.744,Why don't you introduce yourself as the panel again to make up for the false start an hour ago and I will turn it over to you.,115,,
1239,0.97,7752.744,7753.579,"Thank you, chair Lewis.",116,,
1240,0.97,7753.579,7763.255,I am interim of the Seattle public library.,116,,
1241,0.97,7763.255,7773.265,And I am Jay Donahue with the Seattle public library.,117,,
1242,0.97,7773.265,7774.066,Thank you.,118,,
1243,0.97,7774.066,7781.807,We have before you an item that we hope is fairly brief after I know a longer meeting on a very important topic.,118,,
1244,0.97,7781.807,7790.115,What we have before you is a property swap transaction that occurred back in March of 2021.,118,,
1245,0.97,7790.115,7803.896,Our board of trustees reviewed and approved this swap at that time . Alex will walk through a quick presentation of what this meant for the library.,118,,
1246,0.97,7803.896,7805.364,Great.,119,,
1247,0.97,7805.364,7811.236,"Thank you, Tom . I hope everyone can see the presentation.",119,,
1248,0.97,7811.236,7823.048,"Just quick to give you the property that we have acquired, it is called our maintenance and operations center.",119,,
1249,0.97,7823.048,7829.721,We wanted to give you a quick look at how we use the facility.,119,,
1250,0.97,7829.721,7844.57,It is the warehouse and storage space for all of our maintenance related work for our 26 branch libraries . The facility is used to house our building maintenance workshops.,119,,
1251,0.97,7844.57,7868.76,"This is where a lot of the fixes and repairs and build UPS related to our facility are being done . We store our grounds work, landscape, custodial, and the building maintenance Equipments and supplies there.",119,,
1252,0.97,7868.76,7872.231,As well as housing our fleet services for our delivery vans as well as mobile service vans.,119,,
1253,0.97,7872.231,7878.704,We also house our library furniture and supplies there as well.,119,,
1254,0.97,7878.704,7910.202,"So just a quick history, back in 2019, we actually had small storage unit at a couple of rental places where we would be housing all of these different supplies and equipment and we finally landed a space, which is a property at 5510 fourth Avenue as our new maintenance and operations center.",119,,
1255,0.97,7910.202,7912.17,We acquired this property back in 2019.,119,,
1256,0.97,7912.17,7924.816,"In late 2020, we were approached by Georgetown community development group really with a proposal to do a property swap.",119,,
1257,0.97,7924.816,7940.999,They brought to us the property at 5910 Corson Avenue.,119,,
1258,0.97,7940.999,7944.336,"Loops, sorry about that.",119,,
1259,0.97,7944.336,7950.575,They could help with our legal team and we were able to complete the property swap on March 31st.,119,,
1260,0.97,7950.575,7966.658,"You know, one other thing we want to make sure is the revenue and property exchange that this was purely net zero property exchange on our end.",119,,
1261,0.97,7966.658,7977.235,"So, with that, just a quick comparison in terms of why we have decided to move forward on the property swap.",119,,
1262,0.97,7977.235,7990.148,The previous property at 5510 4TH Avenue has a square footage of thousand.,119,,
1263,0.97,7990.148,8018.076,"10,000 was really the square footage that we can use for our warehouse . really the storing of the equipment supplies and really a lot of warehouse needs and a quick purchase was about 5.83 and we have spent about 600,000--actually, about $800,000 for the improvement.",119,,
1264,0.97,8018.076,8030.856,One other thing that was attractive for the Georgetown community group was the fact that this property is a multifamily residential zone.,119,,
1265,0.97,8030.856,8040.999,"You know, I think they approached us in the hopes that they could build affordable housing.",119,,
1266,0.97,8040.999,8051.009,"Compared to the new property that they had proposed to us, it does have a bigger square footage space . It has almost 20,000 square feet.",119,,
1267,0.97,8051.009,8055.247,"Of that, 8000 square feet were pure warehouse space.",119,,
1268,0.97,8055.247,8063.155,Definitely we had much better use of that warehouse space for our specific needs.,119,,
1269,0.97,8063.155,8079.404,"The property was on sale for $6.9 million . sorry, $6.8 million . This does include a parcel adjacent to the property that has about 5000 square feet of parking lot.",119,,
1270,0.97,8079.404,8089.147,What we felt was this property was much more versatile in terms of our need and particularly the use of the warehouse.,119,,
1271,0.97,8089.147,8098.056,The fact that we are not incurring any additional cost really led us to complete the property swap.,119,,
1272,0.97,8098.056,8107.432,This is really the map of the current place we are asking the Council to accept in terms of the deed.,119,,
1273,0.97,8107.432,8109.468,This property is right here.,119,,
1274,0.97,8109.468,8127.519,"The whole area as well as the adjacent on Doris street . So, any questions in terms of our property swap and evidence of our deed?",119,,
1275,0.97,8127.519,8129.588,"Thank you very much for the presentation, Alex.",120,,
1276,0.97,8129.588,8144.803,Are there any questions from Councilmembers? I know this falls under Councilmember Morris--Morales' district.,120,,
1277,0.97,8144.803,8149.341,"Okay, seeing none, this is approved by the library board.",120,,
1278,0.97,8149.341,8171.963,"Can you walk us through that little bit for the committee members, the library board in these acquisition decisions and the role here today as a Council to ratify that? I think it is good to know what considerations were in front of the library board to inform our decision as well.",120,,
1279,0.97,8171.963,8174.266,Absolutely.,121,,
1280,0.97,8174.266,8189.047,"The board of trustees has Policy-Setting authority for the library and back in probably late January or February, the board was informed of that.",121,,
1281,0.97,8189.047,8193.752,They reviewed this possibility.,121,,
1282,0.97,8193.752,8212.671,"Obviously the chief librarian at the time had presented it to them along with Alex, that this opportunity could provide us more flexibility for our maintenance operations center.",121,,
1283,0.97,8212.671,8216.308,"With that, they authorized the chief librarian to pursue this option.",121,,
1284,0.97,8216.308,8228.82,We further then worked with Sas to broker this deal to make sure it was a clean Zero-Sum property swap.,121,,
1285,0.97,8228.82,8243.101,"At this point, once all conditions were met, the board of trustees in a full public meeting accepted that purchase.",121,,
1286,0.97,8243.101,8244.536,"Excuse me, not a purchase, but a swap.",121,,
1287,0.97,8244.536,8249.741,They ratified that swap.,121,,
1288,0.97,8249.741,8251.843,Thank you so much.,122,,
1289,0.97,8251.843,8261.386,I believe Councilmember Morales is --,122,,
1290,0.97,8261.386,8261.786,Hello?,123,,
1291,0.97,8261.786,8263.955,"Yes, there was a technical issue.",124,,
1292,0.97,8263.955,8265.256,Councilmember Morales?,124,,
1293,0.97,8265.256,8267.492,"Sorry, I am having real issues today.",125,,
1294,0.97,8267.492,8269.527,I can't see what you are posting.,125,,
1295,0.97,8269.527,8288.847,"Can you just talk a little bit about whether there are any issues around zoning for the swap and uses? well, maybe I will start there and I may have another question for you.",125,,
1296,0.97,8288.847,8290.415,Pardon me.,126,,
1297,0.97,8290.415,8302.427,There were no zoning issues for the library in the swap . that was advantageous to us in that sense . There was nothing that hurt us in that.,126,,
1298,0.97,8302.427,8322.747,"As far as the Georgetown community development group, you know, their interest I believe was in the fact that the building we previously had was zoned for multifamily or residential and that is where their interest was at.",126,,
1299,0.97,8322.747,8323.715,Okay.,127,,
1300,0.97,8323.715,8325.984,Thank you.,127,,
1301,0.97,8325.984,8352.177,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales . are there any other questions for our Seattle public library panel? Okay, seeing no questions, I do want to bring this matter to a vote today, given the urgency of the library in ratifying this swap.",128,,
1302,0.97,8352.177,8369.26,"So, not hearing kind of any concerns and in consideration of the through presentation, I think I will move forward to that and move the bill at this point.",128,,
1303,0.97,8369.26,8376.568,I move Council bill 120258 to bring it before the Council.,128,,
1304,0.97,8376.568,8378.37,Is there a second for that?,128,,
1305,0.97,8378.37,8379.771,Second.,129,,
1306,0.97,8379.771,8380.472,Okay.,130,,
1307,0.97,8380.472,8394.619,"So, the bill is now before the committee . are there any comments on the legislation in front of the committee?",130,,
1308,0.97,8394.619,8400.759,"Okay, seeing none, I will call for a vote on the ordinance.",130,,
1309,0.97,8400.759,8411.035,"Mr. Clark, will you please read the role on recommending to the full council passage of Council bill 120258?",130,,
1310,0.97,8411.035,8416.341,Councilmember Herbold?,131,,
1311,0.97,8416.341,8417.942,Yes.,132,,
1312,0.97,8417.942,8423.681,Council President Juarez?,133,,
1313,0.97,8423.681,8424.082,Aye.,134,,
