34,0.97,181.814,194.594,Thank you members of the Council and happy to be here today.,4,,
35,0.97,195.895,196.729,We are coming up tomorrow at 5:00 P.M.,4,,
36,0.97,196.729,197.397,On the House of origin cut off.,4,,
37,0.97,197.397,199.699,"As a reminder, that is the deadline that bills have to move out of the Chamber from which they originated.",4,,
38,0.97,199.699,207.206,House bills have to be passed out the house for an Senate has to be passed off the Senate floor.,4,,
39,0.97,207.206,209.976,We are closely tracking a number of bills that are of interest to you and to the city and we will go into those in a little bit.,4,,
40,0.97,209.976,223.156,"I want to provide a couple of high-level updates before we do that . First the revenue forecast, the States revenue forecast will be coming out with an update on Wednesday, the 16th.",4,,
41,0.97,223.156,236.836,"That is going to corsage the release are update of the proposals for the operating capital and transportation budgets and we are expecting to see those either later this week, or early next week.",4,,
42,0.97,236.836,247.614,Those will come out and will be monitored closely and we look for items of interest and items of impact to the city.,4,,
43,0.97,247.614,266.099,"And also, something we have you have been closely monitoring, last Tuesday, just after Council briefing the house and Senate transportation shares released a new transportation revenue package proposal.",4,,
44,0.97,266.099,267.066,I will go over some of those details now.,4,,
45,0.97,267.066,278.478,"I will start by saying, we have been talking about this and the Legislature has been talking about this for several years now.",4,,
46,0.97,278.478,282.849,"Some changes in legislative Dynamics occurred during the interim, most notably changing the Senate transportation share.",4,,
47,0.97,282.849,291.524,Senator Hobbs got promoted to be the new Secretary of state.,4,,
48,0.97,291.524,297.563,And Senator Leah has stepped into his role as transportation share.,4,,
49,0.97,297.563,307.874,I think that combined with other Dynamics allow for the house and Senate to align more closely on the proposals . You may recall in previous years the house had their proposal and the Senate had their version.,4,,
50,0.97,307.874,321.254,This year they have jointly come together to release a proposal which I think speaks to some real movement and a better chance of something getting done this year.,4,,
51,0.97,321.254,326.492,The proposal has changed somewhat.,4,,
52,0.97,326.492,327.393,From one we have reviewed previously.,4,,
53,0.97,327.393,343.176,"It is smaller in scope and we are looking at $16.8 billion package, which sounds large but the proposals last year or 18 to 28.",4,,
54,0.97,343.176,343.609,Úthis is scale down.,4,,
55,0.97,343.609,347.58,Most notably the Scaling down has come by removing any new increase to the gas tax.,4,,
56,0.97,347.58,361.194,That was a major component of previous proposals and that has been removed.,4,,
57,0.97,361.194,368.134,"Instead, legislators are relying primarily on revenues derived from the climate commitment active that was passed last year and that is the States new cap an invest program.",4,,
58,0.97,368.134,383.85,"Predominantly relying on those revenues, $5.4 billion . They are also assuming $3.4 billion in funding from the reauthorization of the service transportation act at the Federal level.",4,,
59,0.97,383.85,391.891,And there is a proposal to institute a new tax on exported fuels.,4,,
60,0.97,391.891,393.559,Feels exported out of the state and that would bring us to billion dollars.,4,,
61,0.97,393.559,405.638,"There is a one-time transfer from the operating budget to the transportation budget of $2 billion and there is a Smorgasbord of increases to various fees, raising just north of $1 million.",4,,
62,0.97,405.638,408.408,That is the summary of the revenue side.,4,,
63,0.97,408.408,426.359,"On the spending side there has been some chips and changes, most notably the proposal that was put forward has more money than previous proposals . and more money than any revenue package we have seen in the States history, put toward finding.",4,,
64,0.97,426.359,433.599,"Transit, bike, green transportation and Electrification.",4,,
65,0.97,433.599,440.439,That is all funding booked from the climate commitment act in that is about $5.4 billion in total.,4,,
66,0.97,440.439,445.878,"New increased, state grants that the city would be competitive for.",4,,
67,0.97,445.878,465.798,"The remainder of the package, in the past I have described it as highway spending but what it really is is the 18th amendment restricted which means it has to be spent on certain sources.",4,,
68,0.97,465.798,471.671,I make that distinction now because it is not really dedicated to highways in the way we have understood it to be in the past and seen it to be in the past.,4,,
69,0.97,471.671,474.04,There is about $3 billion in maintenance and preservation which is a sizable investment from the States part.,4,,
70,0.97,474.04,481.28,There is $2.4 billion for fish passage barriers and the States Covid obligation.,4,,
71,0.97,481.28,496.963,And there is some funding for new projects within the 18th amendment restricted account and there is some spending I want to highlight that would impact the city of Seattle through the Washington D.O.T.,4,,
72,0.97,496.963,517.783,"Programs or directly on Seattle projects . The most substantial, a lot of the transportation revenues have been declining since the pandemic, wears of the revenues have bounced back.",4,,
73,0.97,517.783,520.887,And number of projects from the connecting Washington 2015 transportation revenue package have been experiencing shortfalls.,4,,
74,0.97,520.887,526.726,This proposal would Backfill a lot of those shortfalls including the state route 520 West and project.,4,,
75,0.97,526.726,529.362,Which is within the city of Seattle.,4,,
76,0.97,529.362,541.44,"That would receive $406 million in Backfill . in terms of new projects, there is $50 million Bookmark for pedestrian safety improvements.",4,,
77,0.97,541.44,547.78,$25 million for the transportation corridor system improvements.,4,,
78,0.97,547.78,555.888,"And 500,000 booked for the pedestrian improvements in white center.",4,,
79,0.97,555.888,564.497,I will pause and see if there are any questions I want to save time for updates with regards to the bills we are tracking for you.,4,,
80,0.97,564.497,573.572,"Before we go to Councilmember Pedersen, this was attached to the memo we got from Oir, the last two pages.",5,,
81,0.97,573.572,580.98,It outlines the whole $16.8 billion and thank you for going through those.,5,,
82,0.97,580.98,584.216,The things you mentioned were exactly what I was going to mention.,5,,
83,0.97,584.216,586.819,The North Aurora safety improvement.,5,,
84,0.97,586.819,593.659,"I am excited that the tribes, they have transit and mobility grants . I don't know if I have seen that before.",5,,
85,0.97,593.659,596.195,I will handed over to Councilmember Pedersen.,5,,
86,0.97,596.195,598.597,He has it.,5,,
87,0.97,598.597,602.935,Thank you Council President Juarez.,6,,
88,0.97,602.935,606.339,And thank you to your team and the briefing as well.,6,,
89,0.97,606.339,626.759,I know a lot of us are excited about the democratic state Transportationpackage and the projects you mentioned like 520 and Aurora and et cetera.,6,,
90,0.97,634.9,636.535,"For context, the 16 billion that is spread out over 16 years, is that correct?",6,,
91,0.97,636.535,636.969,That is correct.,7,,
92,0.97,636.969,637.603,Thank you for clarifying that.,7,,
93,0.97,637.603,638.204,It is a 16 year proposal.,7,,
94,0.97,638.204,649.115,"Of the sources of funds in the two resources bills, House bill and Senate bill, of that 16 billion spread out over 16 years are there any sources that are more at risk than others? and if those sources don't come through, do we know how the state would Prioritize the $16 billion they are spending?",8,,
95,0.97,649.115,664.663,I think they have uncertainty attached to them for a variety of reasons.,9,,
96,0.97,664.663,666.265,The exported fuels tax and the one-time transfer from the general fund.,9,,
97,0.97,666.265,671.671,"That is obviously, not an insubstantial amount of the package.",9,,
98,0.97,671.671,678.344,They are each $2 billion.,9,,
99,0.97,678.344,679.145,Combine will be about $4 billion.,9,,
100,0.97,679.145,690.69,"Unfortunately, Councilmember, we don't really know necessarily what they would cut it for some reason those don't make it across the finish line.",9,,
101,0.97,690.69,701.067,"We are advocating on behalf of the city's interest and I think if those don't have sufficient support within the Legislaure, we will see a revised proposal before something is passed.",9,,
102,0.97,701.067,711.744,"But Obviously, the chair is including it and it would indicate it has at least some support and ability to pass.",9,,
103,0.97,711.744,714.947,If slightly Shakier than other elements.,9,,
104,0.97,714.947,718.584,Thank you.,10,,
105,0.97,718.584,730.229,There is a policy change in the legislation allowing for utilities to potentially be increased.,10,,
106,0.97,730.229,737.336,"As I understand it, in reading the legislation it would not impact Seattle city light and it would not impact Seattle public utilities . is that correct?",10,,
107,0.97,737.336,743.275,The proposal contemplated includes a handful of new revenue options for cities.,11,,
108,0.97,743.275,753.552,"They would receive the authority to implement . One will be a .1% sales tax, similar to the existing authority.",11,,
109,0.97,753.552,758.491,The other would be a new 2% tax on a select utilities.,11,,
110,0.97,758.491,768.467,"I believe this is, in the document that was sent this is listed as, all utilities, except electricity.",11,,
111,0.97,768.467,779.812,We have actually--they have been rolling out information in official language on these bills throughout the week and we have some additional clarity.,11,,
112,0.97,779.812,782.281,It would just be three specific utilities.,11,,
113,0.97,782.281,786.886,"And that would be natural gas, steam and telephone.",11,,
114,0.97,786.886,793.092,It would not impact our municipal utilities at the city.,11,,
115,0.97,793.092,804.336,"And I would note, that 2% tax, if the package were to pass, that would be an authority that the city would gain and need to make a decision about whether or not to impose.",11,,
116,0.97,804.336,812.378,It would not be imposed on us.,11,,
117,0.97,812.378,812.845,Thank you.,12,,
118,0.97,812.845,813.812,"Last question, my favorite topic is bridges.",12,,
119,0.97,813.812,815.014,I appreciate you highlighting a couple of bridge items.,12,,
120,0.97,815.014,817.883,That are important to us.,12,,
121,0.97,817.883,829.395,It looks like it is still not much for bridges and I don't see the I-5 bridge to North Seattle.,12,,
122,0.97,829.395,829.795,I don't see that.,12,,
123,0.97,829.795,837.036,That has concrete liberally falling from the belly of the bridge . on a couple of parks.,12,,
124,0.97,837.036,844.91,How would that be funded? for Washington D.O.T.,12,,
125,0.97,844.91,845.244,To fix that.,12,,
126,0.97,845.244,846.045,I don't see that listed separately.,12,,
127,0.97,846.045,865.197,"There is no specific call out for any sort of work on I-5 in that area you are Referencing, Councilmember.",13,,
128,0.97,865.197,868.701,"I will say that the $3 billion in maintenance and preservation, that funding could go toward that and that is something we report to work with Washington D.O.T.",13,,
129,0.97,868.701,868.968,On that.,13,,
130,0.97,868.968,873.839,If it is passed on the implementation on where those dollars are going.,13,,
131,0.97,873.839,875.741,Other any more questions for Quinn regarding this piece?,14,,
132,0.97,875.741,880.112,I am not seeing any.,14,,
133,0.97,880.112,883.349,"Gael, do you want to keep walking us through this?",14,,
134,0.97,883.349,883.682,Thank you.,15,,
135,0.97,883.682,884.016,"Yes, indeed.",15,,
136,0.97,884.016,895.961,We will have Elsa give you as much up-to-date input on the moving train that is happening in Olympia virtually and physically right now.,15,,
137,0.97,895.961,901.567,"Go ahead, Elsa.",15,,
138,0.97,901.567,904.37,Quinn usually covers transportation but I will mention a few bills we have seen move forward already.,16,,
139,0.97,904.37,910.909,One is 5707 which would extend our automated traffic camera enforcement pilot.,16,,
140,0.97,910.909,917.983,I think I am encouraged with that one.,16,,
141,0.97,917.983,929.061,We have another bill we are supportive of that would create more ease and renewal of the transportation benefit district.,16,,
142,0.97,929.061,930.696,There is a limit on the number of times the city can renew that authority.,16,,
143,0.97,930.696,931.931,This would eliminate that sunset.,16,,
144,0.97,931.931,946.812,We are encouraged to see both of those move out of the Senate . Another bill that a number of you have been following that we have been working on for quite some time is related to--for tiny House villages.,16,,
145,0.97,946.812,953.886,And clarifying city authority around those exemptions.,16,,
146,0.97,953.886,966.699,"We saw that move out of the Senate which was very encouraging and we will work with House members on how to strengthen that policy in the house . Some of the big city priorities have already moved, which is nice to have that happen.",16,,
147,0.97,966.699,967.666,It uses your mind as you approach cut off.,16,,
148,0.97,967.666,975.474,A few other bills in the housing space that we are followed for some time.,16,,
149,0.97,975.474,984.65,Maybe this bill has not been briefed this year but came up last year which is 1099 which would add climate change response to the States comprehensive planning framework.,16,,
150,0.97,984.65,989.588,That came out of the house and we are encouraged to see the bill move out.,16,,
151,0.97,989.588,1010.275,Another bill that moved out of the housing space is apple homes for house which would provide continuity for Medicaid community supports and we are encouraging support of that bill this year.,16,,
152,0.97,1010.275,1013.946,Some of you have caught up with our team on that one.,16,,
153,0.97,1013.946,1014.813,Some bills Weare awaiting action on.,16,,
154,0.97,1014.813,1025.224,"Something I think many of you have indicated that you are interested in following is 1782, the governor's housing proposal.",16,,
155,0.97,1025.224,1033.265,That bill is awaiting a vote in the house . It has been pulled to the floor calendar but we have not seen it on the run list yet.,16,,
156,0.97,1033.265,1035.834,We will follow that bill closely.,16,,
157,0.97,1035.834,1038.337,And watch for a floor vote on that bill.,16,,
158,0.97,1038.337,1048.213,I think the other bill that some of you have been tracking closely is 1904.,16,,
159,0.97,1048.213,1055.888,The rental notice bill requiring notice to Renters about increases and their rent above 7%.,16,,
160,0.97,1055.888,1081.413,That bill is on the House second reading and it has not received a floor vote . We will watch that and provide you with a more comprehensive update next week about bills that have made it through cut off or have not made it . I think maybe the final section that I would touch on quickly is on public safety.,16,,
161,0.97,1081.413,1088.287,Many of you have been following updates to use of force legislation.,16,,
162,0.97,1088.287,1112.211,"There has been movement on those bills . The Senate bill, 5919, which would modify the standards for use of force in a number of areas including establishing the definition of use of force and authorizing some vehicular pursuits, passed out of the Senate last week.",16,,
163,0.97,1112.211,1117.95,"Fan a House bill, 2037, which has somewhat more limited reach and the Senate version has also passed off the floor.",16,,
164,0.97,1117.95,1122.121,Both of those bills are continuing through the process.,16,,
165,0.97,1122.121,1126.592,And have received a floor vote.,16,,
166,0.97,1126.592,1130.028,Thank you.,16,,
167,0.97,1130.028,1136.134,"Council President, that concludes our report.",17,,
168,0.97,1136.134,1138.604,But we are happy to take questions.,17,,
169,0.97,1138.604,1142.741,And comments and any other concerns.,17,,
170,0.97,1142.741,1147.613,I know you said this in the memo.,18,,

175,0.97,1169.635,1181.413,That is when bills who made it over will have to make it out of the Senate policy committee or static policy committee.,19,,

178,0.97,1185.083,1194.359,On March 4 we have the House cut off where bills have to make it off the opposite House floor.,19,,
179,0.97,1194.359,1204.036,There is still time after that which could be mysterious.,19,,
180,0.97,1204.036,1205.637,Sometimes when a bill makes it over it is amended in the opposite house.,19,,
181,0.97,1205.637,1207.739,A House bill made it through the committee but in the Senate committee there are further changes.,19,,

188,0.97,1242.341,1245.577,Confusingly.,22,,

198,0.97,1289.187,1300.465,"Perhaps the question was whether the budget is originating from the house or the Senate, depending on the year.",24,,
199,0.97,1300.465,1307.739,In the biennium year it trades back and forth.,25,,
200,0.97,1307.739,1313.011,"Whoever introduced it in the biennium year, I think it was the Senate in 2021.",25,,
201,0.97,1313.011,1320.552,The House will introduce it in the next year.,25,,
202,0.97,1320.552,1324.456,There is a likelihood that the house and Senate operating budgets will come out about the same time.,25,,
203,0.97,1324.456,1330.562,That is what we have been told.,25,,
204,0.97,1330.562,1342.407,"In 2023 it will matter a lot and I think the House--if I am remembering from 2021 and Quinn correct me if I am wrong, they flip back and forth in the biennium year.",25,,
205,0.97,1342.407,1347.212,That is what I was getting at.,26,,
206,0.97,1347.212,1357.823,I think the Supplementals are so closely aligned and the revenue forecasts as Elsa mentioned is coming out on the 16th.,27,,

209,0.97,1363.495,1368.667,I don't know which sides bill number will carry the budget.,27,,
210,0.97,1368.667,1371.136,I don't know that.,27,,

This is--if we end the moratorium at the end of the month that is not going to slow the potential surge in displacement and homelessness that could result . I want to urge the Mayor to reconsider the Eviction moratorium to allow it to extend past the end of February.,48,,
466,0.97,3516.446,3523.119,"And give tenants a chance to catch up on rent, now that folks are at least somewhat able to go back to work.",48,,

516,0.97,3896.325,3915.711,It has resulted in thousands of hours of not being able to be on job sites that are helping to rebuild our city and the workers want to be there.,54,,
517,0.97,3915.711,3934.096,"In order to be on the job site, whether through sound transit jobs or building affordable housing or helping to supply concrete for the West Seattle bridge, the thing needed is a fair contract and the employers have not been coming to the table and bargaining in good faith as required by law.",54,,
518,0.97,3934.096,3944.674,This morning Congressman Smith was there and he said this standstill comes at the expense of people and hurts families.,54,,
519,0.97,3944.674,3960.389,The actions by the employer seem to indicate undermining unions then rather than negotiating in good faith.,54,,
520,0.97,3960.656,3973.803,By echo that sentiment and I share that this Council has heard supportive comments from workers and their right to be striking and we are rallying behind them to make sure they get a good contract and we get trained and skilled union members deploying concrete.,54,,
521,0.97,3973.803,3989.385,We want to make sure these union members from teamsters 174 have their contractor filled and we have the infrastructure met.,54,,

535,0.97,4125.221,4134.663,"Even in cities that have an all ages helmet law, Seattle is one of the very few and Tacoma repealed their helmet law in July 2020.",54,,
536,0.97,4134.663,4142.238,Notably because of the impact on racial equity concerns and the bias that is going into enforcement.,54,,
537,0.97,4142.238,4157.72,Court records show black cyclists from a decade ago were to be Ticketed for not having a and a decade later the disparity was about four times.,54,,

544,0.97,4227.156,4242.004,This is money we have already approved . There is a need to get additional rental assistance.,54,,
545,0.97,4242.004,4249.945,We will continue to ask through the funding requested at the Federal level.,54,,
546,0.97,4249.945,4275.304,United way of King County has been getting assistance out and we see the largest funding is going into households . We know that 96% of rental assistance dollars have been to landlords.,54,,

582,0.97,4590.586,4601.797,"According to SPD's crime dashboard, property crime increased 8% from 2020 until 2021.",61,,
