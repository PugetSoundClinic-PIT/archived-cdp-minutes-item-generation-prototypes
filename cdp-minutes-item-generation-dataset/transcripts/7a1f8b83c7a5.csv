68,0.97,443.843,454.02,I been a driver for three years and I have 29 deliveries under my belt.,8,,
69,0.97,454.02,456.856,I did get work because I found traditional work didn't help me attend college.,8,,
70,0.97,456.856,460.259,I felt like I was contributing to the community and making good money on the side.,8,,
71,0.97,460.259,467.266,But after about one year the pay was cut and I wasn't seeing orders over $6 and I found out the actual company was subsidizing our tips.,8,,
72,0.97,467.266,469.669,"Through subsidizing pay through the tips, essentially, still in our tips.",8,,
73,0.97,469.669,481.047,"Low payment that cargo without maintenance and I can't pay bills, I have electors calling and it hinders me from getting the next stage of life.",8,,
74,0.97,481.047,498.297,The campaign is put together a port based on pay reports from Jordache workers across the country and we found on average not including tips and after expenses Jordache workers are taking home just about $1.45 per hour with an active job.,8,,
75,0.97,498.297,511.277,"I see a lot of single parents doing this work and I see children working with the children, I see immigrant workers and members nearly every community somebody probably knows someone.",8,,
76,0.97,511.277,517.483,It's flexible work and good but it can be a lot better.,8,,
77,0.97,517.483,529.662,"That is why I'm representing 10,000 workers across the country we are organizing with the pay up campaign to ask Council members today to work with us to set pay standards for independent contractors.",8,,
78,0.97,529.662,543.342,You want to see standards that require companies to pass a minimum wage plus the cost of our expenses to make sure that tips are always on top of our pay and to transparency about what we are getting paid and why.,8,,
79,0.97,543.342,549.248,I would like to invite you at this time to reach out and meet with us in private or whatever you can.,8,,

85,0.97,563.262,595.895,"And just a comment, even though I mentioned earlier that we ask speakers to begin their comments focused on items on today's agenda and the referral calendar come of the rules allow us to permit people to speak to items on the Council's work plan . We are in a strange time now and that we don't have an adopted work plan for the Council and this is why I am showing some leniency to allow speakers to speak on items that are neither on the information referral calendar nor on today's agenda.",9,,
86,0.97,595.895,597.163,Go ahead.,9,,
87,0.97,597.163,601.067,Item K? other business?,10,,
88,0.97,601.067,605.304,That is one way to look at it but that is not all rules.,11,,
89,0.97,605.304,609.008,Go ahead.,11,,
90,0.97,609.008,614.513,"My name is Roy, I'm here to ask the city Council to take up the issue of under payment and Mistreatment of the gig economy.",12,,

92,0.97,628.761,632.331,I work as a bike courier and at the time the use of independent contractors was breaking out.,12,,
93,0.97,632.331,633.833,It became the only competitive business model.,12,,
94,0.97,633.833,639.605,As I grew my business as a courier I learned about best practices for independent contractors including being clear on every detail of an order.,12,,
95,0.97,639.605,643.943,Allowing workers to reject without penalties and giving workers freedom to work for other companies.,12,,
96,0.97,643.943,654.053,The food delivery companies have come in and to the restaurant delivery industry which is similar in many ways to the rush delivery service.,12,,
97,0.97,654.053,658.958,These get work companies have no best practices except for just making more profit.,12,,
98,0.97,658.958,666.465,Working for caviar I make as little as 10 doll Mac an hour before expenses.,12,,
99,0.97,666.465,679.945,The ability to abuse and exploit the labor situation created a nightmare scenario where we were coursed to work on notices working only for one company while having unlimited competition.,12,,
100,0.97,679.945,685.017,Because they hire anyone . and we never really know how much we'll wait until after the work is done.,12,,
101,0.97,685.017,687.219,All with one of the highest risk of injury job Possibles.,12,,
102,0.97,687.219,694.493,Wrist of all adding insult to injury some of those companies have been caught stealing tips.,12,,
103,0.97,694.493,696.295,Like door dash.,12,,
104,0.97,696.295,701.2,"Tips have, about 40% of my income from this work.",12,,
105,0.97,701.2,709.308,So we are here because gig workers ask for the very basics of compensation which is parity with minimum wage employment.,12,,
106,0.97,709.308,713.479,And would like to work with the city Council to set a new standard in the gig economy in Seattle.,12,,
107,0.97,713.479,713.813,Thank you.,12,,
108,0.97,713.813,724.19,"And I'm sorry, I yelled at you when you called my campaign call, I was on my Motorcycle making deliveries and I didn't think you'd be calling.",12,,

127,0.97,809.275,811.51,We have a new City Council and several new members.,20,,
128,0.97,811.51,812.912,This resolution REAFFIRMS Seattle as a welcoming city.,20,,
129,0.97,812.912,826.025,Recognizes the good work of previous city councils and States emphatically we oppose all forms of oppression . I would like to move adoption of the resolution.,20,,

131,0.97,829.795,831.13,To have a second?,21,,

133,0.97,832.031,834.833,It has been moved and Seconded.,23,,
134,0.97,834.833,836.235,That the bill passes.,23,,

136,0.97,837.236,838.237,Yes.,24,,
137,0.97,838.237,839.738,I'm sorry.,24,,
138,0.97,839.738,842.141,This strikes me crazy.,24,,
139,0.97,842.141,851.717,I have to say that I really don't support this resolution.,24,,
140,0.97,851.717,852.952,But I want to explain why.,24,,
141,0.97,852.952,862.861,As a former Seattle human rights Commissioner I think it is really important that when there are instances of human rights abuses throughout the world that we be very specific about what we are objecting to.,24,,
142,0.97,862.861,871.136,Represent all the voices of the constituents and it's important that we don't constrain the voices of our elected officials to speak out against issues directly.,24,,
143,0.97,871.136,887.486,"As representative of district 2, the most diverse district in the city it's important that I look at issues that impact our constituents locally and also I stand in solidarity with international communities whose issues and identities are shared with the constituents we serve.",24,,
144,0.97,887.486,889.255,It's important to denounce oppression everywhere throughout the world.,24,,
145,0.97,889.255,896.996,And we must caution against Universalizing the shared experiences of oppression itself.,24,,
146,0.97,896.996,903.302,Doing so can minimize the individual ways that different groups experience oppression by the systems in our society.,24,,
147,0.97,903.302,912.077,There are specific instances that deserve to be called out and the list of resolutions Referenced in this resolution demonstrate that.,24,,
148,0.97,912.077,919.151,We're talking specifically about straightening public safety for immigrants and refugees.,24,,
149,0.97,919.151,925.624,Specifically about supporting immigrants through the doctor program and specifically about opposing the Trump administration separation of families.,24,,
150,0.97,925.624,932.998,Specifically about protecting human rights defenders.,24,,
151,0.97,932.998,936.635,And specifically about upholding the rights and dignity of native people in our city and in our country.,24,,
152,0.97,936.635,954.72,"So while I appreciate the intent behind this to make sure that we are clear that we are as a counsel committed to protecting people, I think it's important that we acknowledge a blanket statement like this can't serve to obscure the violence that is committed intentionally upon marginalized groups.",24,,
153,0.97,954.72,967.966,As elected officials in positions of power we have to continue to lift up the voices of those who have been silenced to the margins with their oppression has been brought to our attention.,24,,
154,0.97,967.966,969.535,"Whether it is local, national or international.",24,,
155,0.97,969.535,972.538,We can't be silent when the issues of human rights are at stake.,24,,
156,0.97,972.538,977.376,"And so, I will not be supporting this resolution.",24,,
157,0.97,977.376,978.477,Thank you.,24,,
158,0.97,978.477,981.28,Would you like to respond?,25,,
159,0.97,981.28,981.747,Yes.,26,,
160,0.97,981.747,983.315,You want to say something?,26,,
161,0.97,983.315,985.584,Council member Lewis?,27,,
162,0.97,985.584,1001.4,"Madam President pro Tem, I want to speak, listen closely to Council members Morales's remarks.",28,,
163,0.97,1001.4,1016.281,"That is why one of the things I do want to move, I don't know if know the appropriate time, there is a proposed amendment 1 that was circulating, and I want to inquire about the procedure and when it would be appropriate to move.",28,,
164,0.97,1016.281,1018.217,Or to speak to it.,28,,
165,0.97,1018.217,1020.319,I don't know.,28,,
166,0.97,1020.319,1036.602,"I do agree that Procedurally it's important to get the amendment on the table but I do want to show, show cuts member Pedersen the courtesy of responding to the comments if he wishes to do so.",29,,
167,0.97,1036.602,1037.403,Thank you.,30,,
168,0.97,1037.403,1038.604,Thank you Councilmember Morales for the comments.,30,,
169,0.97,1038.604,1051.35,"For me it is yes and situation, this is reaffirming Seattle as a welcoming city as one of the key components of the resolution.",30,,
170,0.97,1051.35,1068.867,And we should be having other resolutions about specific instances of oppression . looking on the amnesty International Website right now there are scores of oppressive events occurring right now . human rights watch as well.,30,,
171,0.97,1068.867,1076.975,But that Website has other issues that are being highlighted as instances of oppression.,30,,
172,0.97,1076.975,1082.181,But we don't have resolutions for everything going on . every day.,30,,
173,0.97,1082.181,1088.287,"So, this is reaffirming Seattle as a welcoming city and condemning all forms of oppression throughout the world.",30,,
174,0.97,1088.287,1097.663,And it also asks the office of Intergovernmental relations to continue to alert us about International issues that are Impacting Seattle.,30,,
175,0.97,1097.663,1109.107,"And the other final section does not, it States, it does not impede or limit any city council members ability to introduce future resolutions.",30,,
176,0.97,1109.107,1113.312,Those two sections were added just this week.,30,,
177,0.97,1113.312,1115.114,So I'm not sure everybody saw those.,30,,
178,0.97,1115.114,1123.322,But I think that may help to address the concern that we should be having additional resolutions . We have one scheduled for next week.,30,,
179,0.97,1123.322,1126.325,That will be discussing.,30,,
180,0.97,1126.325,1128.193,It is not an either or situation.,30,,
181,0.97,1128.193,1132.431,It is a Yes and situation.,30,,
182,0.97,1132.431,1137.736,"And again, I added those two Sctions at the end which might've been obscured previously.",30,,
183,0.97,1137.736,1157.856,"And would welcome an amendment that was raised earlier about defining oppression but again, I want to be on the record agreeing with Councilmember Morales we are not meant, not meaning to exclude but actually to cast a wide net and welcome more resolutions that are specific.",30,,
184,0.97,1157.856,1165.764,Often groups are coming to us with specific requests and we want to honor those as well.,30,,
185,0.97,1165.764,1169.902,"So, this is not meant to exclude those.",30,,
186,0.97,1169.902,1171.47,For sure.,30,,
187,0.97,1171.47,1180.179,It is music to my ears to hear you say that we want as a counsel to honor future requests.,31,,
188,0.97,1180.179,1190.756,For resolutions addressing those issues important to our constituents on other issues that may not be directly Impacting the city.,31,,
189,0.97,1190.756,1204.57,And I also want to speak to my appreciation that you actually included language in the resolution to make their that the resolution does not impede or limit any customer visibility to introduce future resolutions.,31,,
190,0.97,1204.57,1221.62,"Before we discuss the amendment, I need to make sure that since we have a requirement, rule for our counsel for the opportunity to be able to review amendments in advance.",31,,
191,0.97,1221.62,1224.289,We have a rule that we receive them by noon today.,31,,
192,0.97,1224.289,1239.905,We did not receive this particular amendment . I want to make sure there is no objection to suspending the rules to allow for consideration of this proposed amendment to resolution 31928.,31,,
193,0.97,1239.905,1247.613,"Hearing no objections, the counsel rule is suspended and we can consider the amendment.",31,,
194,0.97,1247.613,1256.555,"Thank you, so, this amendment actually came from a couple of different, it was thought about by a couple of different Council members.",32,,
195,0.97,1256.555,1267.266,So it was confirmed this afternoon and actually wanted so we inserted a definition of oppression so it made it more clear.,32,,
196,0.97,1267.266,1273.639,It's no surprise it wasn't an attorney on our counsel who suggested this.,32,,
197,0.97,1273.639,1275.007,That is the amendment before us.,32,,
198,0.97,1275.007,1286.118,Whereas oppression is defined by the Cambridge dictionary as quote a situation where people are governed in an unfair and cruel way and prevented from having opportunities and freedom.,32,,
199,0.97,1286.118,1293.158,And is defined by Merriam- Webster as a quote unjust or cruel exercise of authority or power.,32,,
200,0.97,1293.158,1297.195,"And, so, you're moving?",33,,
201,0.97,1297.195,1307.506,I would like to move this amendment to insert the clause.,34,,
202,0.97,1307.506,1308.373,"Thank you, second?",35,,
203,0.97,1308.373,1308.774,Second.,36,,
204,0.97,1308.774,1310.876,"Very good, moved and Seconded to amend the resolution.",37,,
205,0.97,1310.876,1312.511,Are there any comments on the amendment itself?,37,,
206,0.97,1312.511,1317.082,All those in favor of the amendment?,37,,
207,0.97,1317.082,1322.988,Are there any opposed votes?,37,,

210,0.97,1324.623,1334.032,"Are there any other further comments on the motion before us, the bulk of the bullish ocean?",37,,

212,0.97,1334.599,1340.305,Thank you.,38,,
213,0.97,1340.305,1353.118,"So having adopted that amendment, I don't mind clarifying for those in the audience were watching at home that I was the Attorney on the counsel that expressed concern about the lack of a definition of oppression.",38,,
214,0.97,1353.118,1362.627,I do think it's important to state a reasonable degree of specificity what we are condemning to the rest of the world.,38,,
215,0.97,1362.627,1389.387,"You know, we could discuss all day, I'm not suggesting that we do, right at this moment, the exact and most perfect and comprehensive definition of oppression but the ones that have been adopted as dictionary definitions, I think R, good enough to confine the scope of the resolution and describe the scope of generally what we are, expressing our condemnation too.",38,,
216,0.97,1389.387,1403.068,"I do just want to state, and Council member Pedersen, I appreciate the changes to the resolution that were made over the last week as well.",38,,
217,0.97,1403.068,1411.51,"And Council member Morales's points, I thought it was very well taken.",38,,
218,0.97,1411.51,1426.792,I am stating as a Councilmember I am personally not going to have this resolution informed limit or Stymie any potential resolution I might seek to consider in the future.,38,,
219,0.97,1426.792,1437.135,More sway my vote on the resolutions that my colleagues bring on whether I should or should not vote against it because it's included by incorporation in the sentiment of the resolution.,38,,
220,0.97,1437.135,1449.948,"I making that clear for the folks here, the folks, my constituents that have sent me Emails concerned that I am voting for the resolution and will impact my vote on the resolution we will consider next week.",38,,
221,0.97,1449.948,1483.882,"I will state that I do, I do appreciate Councilmember Pedersen's resolution despite the fact that it could be somewhat Duplicative with other resolutions that cite specific acts of violence but I will give the benefit of the doubt to my colleague and I will vote in favor of this having been amended to include the definition.",38,,
222,0.97,1483.882,1485.684,And those will be mine comments on that.,38,,
223,0.97,1485.684,1486.151,Thank you.,39,,
224,0.97,1486.151,1486.484,Anyone else?,39,,
225,0.97,1486.484,1504.636,"So, before voting I want to note that as we, I think all have agreed that this resolution should not be considered as adequate to cover all situations that arise in the future.",39,,
226,0.97,1504.636,1507.372,It does not mean that counsel has to take action on every issue.,39,,
227,0.97,1507.372,1511.376,Is Council members we exercise discretion.,39,,
228,0.97,1511.376,1513.712,On which issues we will take action on.,39,,
229,0.97,1513.712,1525.49,And I believe this counsel will continue to exercise that discretion but it's important to also retain our right and responsibility to take action when we believe that foreign relations are relevant to our constituents.,39,,
230,0.97,1525.49,1533.231,That our constituents are impacted and when our actions on the city council may be meaningful to those constituents.,39,,
231,0.97,1533.231,1538.837,"And with that, either further comments?",39,,
232,0.97,1538.837,1541.74,Okay.,39,,

235,0.97,1557.155,1560.025,Is there other business to come before the Council?,39,,
236,0.97,1560.025,1562.46,I have other business.,39,,
237,0.97,1562.46,1566.731,"I moved to be excused from the February 3, 2020 city council meeting.",39,,

244,0.97,1587.652,1597.195,It's also been brought to my attention that Councilmember war is excused absence made at the five-year 21st meeting needs to be amended to reflect the February 10 city council meeting instead of every five which was approved on January 21.,41,,
245,0.97,1597.195,1613.878,So I moved to amend the motion Excusing Councilmember Juarez by amending the request to date to be excused from the very fifth to Fairbury 10 city council.,41,,
