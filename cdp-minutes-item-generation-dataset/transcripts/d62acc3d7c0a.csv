75,0.97,519.418,522.788,14302 LLC.,10,,
76,0.97,522.788,539.405,"The property owner to the North is the Seattle housing authority, they have surface parking lot that is zoned single-family 7200, as is the portion, the property owner's site that is proposed to be Rezoned.",10,,
77,0.97,539.405,549.849,"So, two portions of the block are currently zoned Single- family, 7200.",10,,
78,0.97,549.849,560.559,"The proposal is to Rezone both of those, they are both portions of split sewn lots and the rest of the lots are zoned Lowrise three, with mandatory housing and Affordability suffix.",10,,
79,0.97,560.559,564.23,Any questions on the location and site we are talking about?,10,,
80,0.97,564.23,565.064,Great.,10,,
81,0.97,565.064,590.289,"So this is zooming in, surface parking lot on the North side serves Seattle housing authority property, and apartment complex, and the main property is proposed to be, currently vacant and proposed to be Redeveloped with 12 Townhomes in four structures.",10,,
82,0.97,590.289,601.2,"The Eastern portion of that property is currently zoned Lowrise 3, and is a corridor.",10,,
83,0.97,601.2,613.312,"It is an environmentally critical area, no development is proposed on that portion of the site because it is a--corridor.",10,,
84,0.97,613.312,629.428,"You can see on this Sli that the site slopes to the East, down into what is a Goalie or ditch, that is currently an open waterway on the East side of the site.",10,,
85,0.97,629.428,640.439,"The remaining most of the block is still Lowrise 3, with Midrise on the East side of the block.",10,,
86,0.97,640.439,649.448,"The site is well served by transit, there is a bus stop for the 65 bus, adjacent to the property.",10,,
87,0.97,649.448,664.363,"30th Avenue northeast in this area is a, and Ontario,--an arterial, and there are number of routes on Lake City way as well.",10,,
88,0.97,664.363,671.17,So this is the proposed development that the Rezone would facilitate.,10,,
89,0.97,671.17,679.845,"12 town houses, and preservation and restoration of the repairing the corridor.",10,,
90,0.97,679.845,692.091,The 12th parking spaces are proposed to serve the 12 townhouses.,10,,
91,0.97,692.091,710.776,"In reviewing the Rezone proposal, the hearing Examiner and SBC I laid out in the municipal land use code, chapter, sorry, that should be 34 in the title.",10,,
92,0.97,710.776,731.63,"Among the key criteria, that the hearing Examiner highlighted, were the site in existent to support zone 2, Lowrise 3, with a multifamily area, your commercial zones along Lake City way, well served by public transit.",10,,
93,0.97,731.63,742.007,With direct arterial access and parks and Rec services.,10,,
94,0.97,742.007,746.946,And this is an image of the site.,10,,
95,0.97,746.946,753.052,"And that is all I have, it is a fairly straightforward request.",10,,
96,0.97,753.052,756.722,And I am happy to answer any questions.,10,,
97,0.97,756.722,762.261,"Good, thank you Lish Whitson.",11,,

99,0.97,765.531,767.967,I understand there are exceptional trees proposed to be removed in the site.,11,,
100,0.97,767.967,775.741,"Can you elaborate which trees are being removed, reasons for removal and what the replacement procedure is at this time.",11,,
101,0.97,775.741,776.542,"Yes, thank you.",12,,
102,0.97,776.542,788.687,"So on this site, the Red numbers are exceptional trees on the site and there are five that were identified by Arborists, for the developer.",12,,
103,0.97,788.687,796.796,"Two are proposed to be removed, they are shown with an X. the Arborist found they were high risk.",12,,
104,0.97,796.796,797.596,And recommended removal.,12,,
105,0.97,797.596,812.111,"They are both Western red Cedar, the development includes planting three new Western red Cedar's along the Eastern edge of the property, of the development.",12,,
106,0.97,812.111,828.928,And also a number of additional trees will be planted within the--is part of the restoration in that area.,12,,
107,0.97,828.928,835.534,The project will involve tearing out Invasive species that are currently in there and replanting with native plants.,12,,
108,0.97,835.534,836.135,Thank you.,13,,
109,0.97,836.135,846.412,"And can you confirm for me, for any other circumstance.",13,,
110,0.97,846.412,849.215,On this image he may not be able to see it.,14,,
111,0.97,849.215,852.718,It says no development allowed in the White section of the lot.,14,,
112,0.97,852.718,857.056,There are limits in the development.,14,,
113,0.97,857.056,860.759,"And in the area, the buffer zone.",14,,
114,0.97,860.759,870.87,"So development, on the site, it is primary imitated to I guess that salmon color, that area on the site.",14,,
115,0.97,870.87,874.139,On the Western portion of the lot.,14,,
116,0.97,874.139,885.951,"The development in the buffer area, but mitigation is required for development, in that area.",14,,
117,0.97,885.951,886.752,That is helpful.,15,,
118,0.97,886.752,891.29,May I provide a summary of what I heard you say and let me know if that is correct or not.,15,,
119,0.97,891.29,898.063,"While we are losing two of the five trees, we will gain use of three trees or four?",15,,
120,0.97,898.063,903.202,"So three Cedar, along, adjacent to the development.",16,,
121,0.97,903.202,913.212,"And then a number of trees, I think there is as many as 21 in the--corridor.",16,,
122,0.97,913.212,926.191,And the three red Cedar will be planted in the zone that can never be developed and has the space it needs for the roots to grow strong in the canopy to grow large.,17,,
123,0.97,926.191,930.929,Is that correct?,17,,
124,0.97,930.929,946.645,"So the three Cedar are being planted in the buffer area, in addition there are 21 Cedar that are being planted within the corridor.",18,,
125,0.97,946.645,947.579,Okay.,19,,
126,0.97,947.579,950.749,Great.,19,,
127,0.97,950.749,957.656,So we will have 21 Cedar in the corridor that can never be developed?,20,,
128,0.97,957.656,958.657,Yes.,21,,
129,0.97,958.657,960.559,Okay.,22,,
130,0.97,960.559,967.333,I have other questions that want to open up for colleagues and Councilmember Lewis joined us at the start of the meeting.,22,,
131,0.97,967.333,972.471,"Apologies for not to begin sooner, Councilmember Lewis has been with us the whole time.",22,,
132,0.97,972.471,974.94,"Colleagues, other questions?",22,,
133,0.97,974.94,976.175,I am not seeing any.,22,,
134,0.97,976.175,976.575,I will continue.,22,,
135,0.97,976.575,983.182,"And if folks have questions, please raise your hand.",22,,
136,0.97,983.182,990.155,"Lish, can you share details about amendments we need to make to this Rezone, if we decide to improve it.",22,,
137,0.97,990.155,992.024,So there are a couple of things.,23,,
138,0.97,992.024,1001.467,So just walk through all of the different documents that you will need to add on as you consider this proposal.,23,,
139,0.97,1001.467,1007.373,The first is Council finding conclusions and decision.,23,,
140,0.97,1007.373,1015.314,That is typically based on the recommended findings conclusion from the hearing Examiner.,23,,
141,0.97,1015.314,1023.188,"The Council's decisions include a draft, based on the hearing Examiner's Recordation.",23,,
142,0.97,1023.188,1034.833,"Plus, a couple changes that I will get into and just a minute and touch upon.",23,,
143,0.97,1034.833,1044.843,"The recommendation that came to Council, was for a designation under the mandatory housing authority program.",23,,
144,0.97,1044.843,1056.388,"The M designation is the lowest designation, appropriate for example, Rezone within a category.",23,,
145,0.97,1056.388,1064.73,"For example, if it was a Rezone from Lowrise 1, to Lowrise 2, it would definitely get the M designation.",23,,
146,0.97,1064.73,1076.975,"The code States that a Rezone from a single family to Lowrise 3, should receive M 2 designation under the program.",23,,
147,0.97,1076.975,1093.492,"That is the difference of, in this area, it would go from $7.00 a square foot, for affordable housing, to $12.50, a square foot.",23,,
148,0.97,1093.492,1099.665,For affordable housing.,23,,
149,0.97,1099.665,1102.701,To comply with the mandatory housing Affordability program requirements.,23,,
150,0.97,1102.701,1113.779,"Or for a change from 6% of the units, 10 9% of the units, if developers choose to, the performance option under Mha.",23,,
151,0.97,1113.779,1130.529,"So I would recommend that you modify the hearing Examiner's recommendation, to change the designation from M, the M2, consistent with the code.",23,,
152,0.97,1130.529,1131.53,Thank you.,24,,
153,0.97,1131.53,1134.433,That is helpful.,24,,
154,0.97,1134.433,1143.041,"Can you remind me with reviewing the documents, was this already assumption within the documents with in the record.",24,,
155,0.97,1143.041,1149.348,"A number of the documents did show M to, but the recommendation that came to Council, did not include that designations.",25,,
156,0.97,1149.348,1152.151,There was an error somewhere.,25,,
157,0.97,1152.151,1152.851,Okay.,26,,
158,0.97,1152.851,1180.479,"And I noticed that there are, we don't, of documents we have to approve, we do not have a document to approve redevelopment plans for the Seattle housing authority site, at 14303 northeast, I want to confirm that this is due to the fact that there are no redevelopment plans for the Seattle housing authority site at 14303, is this correct?",26,,
159,0.97,1180.479,1183.749,Or am I missing this?,26,,
160,0.97,1183.749,1190.289,"Correct, the development, it was only for the corner lot.",27,,
161,0.97,1190.289,1191.69,Is privately owned.,27,,
162,0.97,1191.69,1209.808,"The housing authority was brought in primarily because it did not make sense to keep a small portion of the block and single-family, so there was a request that they be brought into the Rezone as well.",27,,
163,0.97,1209.808,1217.416,"So, thank you for taking up the second set of amendments, to the recommendation.",27,,
164,0.97,1217.416,1224.489,There are three conditions that the hearing Examiner recommends applying to the sites.,27,,
165,0.97,1224.489,1231.396,The first two are both related to the mandatory housing Affordability Acquirements.,27,,
166,0.97,1231.396,1237.236,The third is the development should be consistent with the plans that were filed.,27,,
167,0.97,1237.236,1245.11,For the Redeveloping of the corner property.,27,,
168,0.97,1245.11,1260.025,And I recommend you only have that requiring consistency with the plans to the corner property and not to the seas--Seattle housing authority.,27,,
169,0.97,1260.025,1286.952,"Do apply to the authority they will probably have to come back if and when they chose to pursue development on that site, for amendment to what will become a property use and development agreement, that we will be required to file, in order to affect the Rezone.",27,,
170,0.97,1286.952,1287.552,Thank you.,28,,
171,0.97,1287.552,1291.056,"Are there any other amendments that we need to be aware of, any potential amendments?",28,,
172,0.97,1291.056,1292.891,Those are the two that I flagged for you.,29,,
173,0.97,1292.891,1301.299,We can discuss any amendments Council members may want to pursue.,29,,
174,0.97,1301.299,1309.374,But I did not see anything else in the record that warranted Council changing the hearing Examiner's recommendation.,29,,
175,0.97,1309.374,1315.681,To be have the ability to require any tree replanting's?,30,,
176,0.97,1315.681,1318.417,Or is is outside the zone?,30,,
177,0.97,1318.417,1327.125,So any amendments or additional requirement should be based on the record.,31,,
178,0.97,1327.125,1335.434,And I did not see anything in the record that would necessitate additional negation of impacts.,31,,
179,0.97,1335.434,1337.102,Okay.,32,,
180,0.97,1337.102,1339.337,Thank you.,32,,
181,0.97,1339.337,1341.039,"Colleagues, other questions?",32,,
182,0.97,1341.039,1344.943,I am not seeing any.,32,,
183,0.97,1344.943,1350.716,"Please feel free to pop up, if you do.",32,,
184,0.97,1350.716,1354.82,"Lish, my last question, if we decide to approve the Rezone next week, what are the next UPS from there?",32,,
185,0.97,1354.82,1364.229,"In approving the Rezone you would, in recommending approval of Rezone, you would add the findings conclusions and decision to the clerk file.",33,,
186,0.97,1364.229,1370.869,And direct me to prepare an ordinance that would effectuate the Rezone.,33,,
187,0.97,1370.869,1376.174,"I will work with the property owners, to file property use and development agreements.",33,,
188,0.97,1376.174,1383.348,That reflect the proposed conditions that you place on the property.,33,,
189,0.97,1383.348,1395.794,And introduce a bill probably a week after your vote on the Rezone.,33,,
190,0.97,1395.794,1400.899,And that can be ready for a Council vote a week after that.,33,,
191,0.97,1400.899,1403.702,Thank you.,34,,
192,0.97,1403.702,1406.605,Seeing no other questions.,34,,
193,0.97,1406.605,1409.875,"Colleagues, pop up if you have them.",34,,
194,0.97,1409.875,1416.915,"I will thank you Mr. Whitson and this will be back before the the Committee on Monday, November 5th.",34,,

197,0.97,1428.293,1431.43,"As a reminder our next committee meeting will be Monday, November 1ST, starting at 10:30 A.M.",34,,
198,0.97,1431.43,1432.831,Or directly after Council reaping.,34,,
