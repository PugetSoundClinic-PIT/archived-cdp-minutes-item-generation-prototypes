53,0.97,220.653,231.731,"The budget address promised environmental justice and a green new deal but gave zero specifics . The Mayoral budget for Sdot, like others before it, reflects that level of priority.",18,,
54,0.97,231.731,247.113,"I know our human brains tend to focus on the emergency closest to hand in the Sdot budget stretches the West Seattle bridge and other movements and admits that this focus would, and I quote, limit future investments in other city projects long-term.",18,,

88,0.97,423.423,435.968,We need to focus on things like disability justice and racial equity . that will take the ability to grant out some of that community outreach to trusted partners.,22,,
89,0.97,435.968,446.879,I want to switch to the SBC I budget which does not have a presentation as we can but is absolutely essential as we do the work in Opcd.,22,,

91,0.97,448.781,451.25,Some people call it Redlining.,22,,
92,0.97,451.25,484.817,"We have the new technical summary from a small group of Stakeholders that I will be Emailing to you again . We need an interdepartmental team from Opcd to do serious outreach projects to find out how to have community conversations around design, something that politicians have done but we know that in order for the design to be equitable, there needs to be a strong immunity conversation.",22,,
93,0.97,484.817,487.386,Please fund that.,22,,
94,0.97,487.386,492.458,"Last of all, please read the solidarity budget . so much work, months went into making that.",22,,

104,0.97,538.971,539.972,Here is the thing.,24,,

107,0.97,551.384,558.658,"We believe the city needs to move toward free public transit . for these and many other city priorities, there is a need for new progressive revenue.",24,,
108,0.97,558.658,570.703,The Jumpstart tax last year is a significant start in the right direction but it is a first step.,24,,
109,0.97,570.703,572.505,We need to go further to reform our tax code.,24,,
110,0.97,572.505,574.974,Not only to generate new revenue but also to reduce Regressive taxes.,24,,
111,0.97,574.974,581.614,The solidarity budget believes this is a project the city needs to take seriously in the first step is to figure out what our options are.,24,,
112,0.97,581.614,607.44,"We are asking that the city council take action in this budget process to create a task force of community experts that can research progressive revenue options, both those the city already has the authority to pursue and others I would be possible with new authorization from the state that is A. this is a really important project and we hope that you will not only use this budget to address the city's immediate problem but Lookahead and set the city up to be able to take on larger and more adequate steps moving forward.",24,,
113,0.97,607.44,608.04,Thank you.,24,,

120,0.97,624.056,628.361,I am transit dependent.,26,,
121,0.97,628.361,632.865,This means that I am super poor and I have to take the bus.,26,,
122,0.97,632.865,655.988,"I am calling to support the solidarity budget in the sense that you guys are simply saying invest in communities, specifically transit . You already heard that we are joining with the mass coalition but I just wanted to make sure you know we are asking for an additional $40 million to add 100,000 plus hours, key bus lanes and key priority at intersections.",26,,
123,0.97,655.988,665.564,I know buses are unglamorous but they are super important to folks like me . We are becoming a larger and larger part of the city.,26,,
124,0.97,665.564,668.401,Thank you very much.,26,,
125,0.97,668.401,670.669,Thank you very much.,27,,

128,0.97,672.838,678.511,Good morning.,28,,
129,0.97,678.511,679.979,My name is Marlon Rainwater.,28,,
130,0.97,679.979,686.886,I use the pronoun She/Her and I am representing the Seattle neighborhood Greenway.,28,,
131,0.97,686.886,691.223,I want to adopt the solidarity budget.,28,,
132,0.97,691.223,704.904,I am calling to urge you to please use the solidarity budget as a starting point in evaluating the Mayor's 2020 budget . please continue to divest from policing and punishment and invest in caring and sustainable community.,28,,
133,0.97,704.904,707.006,I am 75 years old.,28,,
134,0.97,707.006,709.809,"I am a healthy, mobile traveler.",28,,
135,0.97,709.809,718.751,I prefer to travel by bike or to walk and I often put my bike on the bus or the light rail.,28,,
136,0.97,718.751,722.455,I had an episode a few years ago when I broke my hip and was dependent on a wheelchair.,28,,
137,0.97,722.455,741.34,"At that time, it was made exceedingly clear to me how dramatically the missing links and the poor connections between our various sustainable and climate friendly transportation systems can be.",28,,
138,0.97,741.34,749.448,A missing curb ramp or broken sidewalk is an insurmountable barrier for a wheelchair user traveling by bus or by light rail.,28,,
139,0.97,749.448,754.487,Buses that run only every half hour are not functioning connections to Light-Rail.,28,,
140,0.97,754.487,762.461,Protected by claims that end into fast-moving traffic won't work for families trying to get their kids to school.,28,,
141,0.97,762.461,770.169,The Mayor's budget does have some small positive increases.,28,,
142,0.97,770.169,784.984,"We are happy, for example, to see funding for the transportation equity Workgroup but we cannot achieve our climate goals or our equitable development goals unless we dramatically shift our transportation priorities away from cars.",28,,
143,0.97,784.984,793.325,"As others have mentioned, we are asking for an additional $100 million for equitable, climate friendly infrastructure for people walking, Biking, rolling, and using transit.",28,,
144,0.97,793.325,793.726,Thank you.,28,,
145,0.97,793.726,794.727,Thank you very much.,29,,

150,0.97,811.01,811.41,Good morning.,30,,
151,0.97,811.41,819.919,This is Doug drum with the Urbanist and we support the vision laid out by the solidarity budget coalition.,30,,
152,0.97,819.919,850.182,"Today we will speak about transit, which got $40 million of additional investment in the solidarity budget . We believe that is important because we still have not returned to the service levels that we had before the pandemic and the renewal of the as Cpd, additional funds in that measure did not get us back to where we were.",30,,
153,0.97,850.182,853.652,It was great that the Council increased what the Mayor proposed but we are still behind on service.,30,,
154,0.97,853.652,856.088,That means working class folks have a harder time getting to work.,30,,
155,0.97,856.088,869.835,"If we top that up, we can return to the transit growth that we were on trend to before the pandemic to get people back in buses and that will help our climate goal.",30,,
156,0.97,869.835,871.303,There was also money for more bus lanes.,30,,
157,0.97,871.303,872.905,Buses are faster.,30,,
158,0.97,872.905,888.053,"The Mayor's budget still does not get us out of the rut we are and where we are not meeting our Seattle pledges, generally just not a vision for a city of the future.",30,,
159,0.97,888.053,901.4,"Still, just getting sucked in to go along, get along . The West Seattle bridge is taking up a huge chunk of that budget, making it look bigger than it otherwise is.",30,,
160,0.97,901.4,911.543,Thank you for your thoughts and we hope that the Mayor's budget can be improved upon.,30,,
161,0.97,911.543,912.945,Thank you for calling in today.,31,,
162,0.97,912.945,913.545,"Good morning, Justin.",31,,

164,0.97,914.647,917.75,"Good morning, members of the Council.",32,,
165,0.97,917.75,927.96,I am a Renter living in district 2 and I am calling as a member of the Seattle transit riders Union.,32,,
166,0.97,927.96,944.843,We are in support of the solidarity budget coalition and we support the entire solidarity budget including continued divestment from SPD and additional investments in health and safety programs in by punk communities.,32,,
167,0.97,944.843,952.918,More investments in public transit bike lanes and especially in sidewalks.,32,,
168,0.97,952.918,955.854,I have lived and worked most of my time in Seattle and the Peripheries.,32,,
169,0.97,955.854,963.696,I know that the city struggles to create places that are safe for people to walk around.,32,,
170,0.97,963.696,971.704,"Despite a decrease in traffic with Covid, pedestrian related vehicle accidents and deaths stayed flat and even increased from previous years.",32,,
171,0.97,971.704,991.99,We can make a significant stride toward achieving the goals of the vision zero by rapidly expanding the development of sidewalks as well as adopting the solidarity budget recommendation of throwing out cameras to make Crosswalks safer for pedestrians to walk inroads.,32,,
172,0.97,991.99,994.226,Thank you for your time today.,32,,
173,0.97,994.226,995.627,Thank you for calling and.,33,,

199,0.97,1105.537,1107.706,That is not reflective of the current need in the city.,40,,
200,0.97,1107.706,1127.659,Our city needs a massive investment in order to effect the change we need . 23 people have been killed while walking and Biking on our streets so far this year and we have not even really hit the point of the year where we have higher numbers of tragedies like that because of the darkness in the winter.,40,,
201,0.97,1127.659,1140.472,"Many more have been seriously injured, have had near misses, or changed the way that they choose to get where to go because of the fear of being hit by a car or being out on the street.",40,,

282,0.97,1569.267,1579.811,"You can see there is some shifting around in the numbers here, both between the adopted and revised and proposed budgets and also between the general Fund and other funding sources.",54,,
283,0.97,1579.811,1582.814,"This is, primarily--there is two main reasons for this.",54,,
284,0.97,1582.814,1593.024,One is that Opcd has received a number of new funding sources for our equitable development initiative over the last several years.,54,,
285,0.97,1593.024,1594.526,All of that funding has been awarded.,54,,
286,0.97,1594.526,1595.894,Not all of it has been spent.,54,,
287,0.97,1595.894,1597.228,That budget carries forward.,54,,
288,0.97,1597.228,1611.543,You see the unspent budget from the previous year show up in the revised budget . that is the job between 2021 and adopted and revised.,54,,
289,0.97,1611.543,1626.958,"You will also see a difference between general funds and other fund allocations, which was partially due to shifting revenue projections for a Short- term tax in 2020 and 2021.",54,,
290,0.97,1626.958,1629.594,"In 2022, there was the addition of the new payroll tax revenue.",54,,

292,0.97,1633.665,1650.081,"Finally, you can see that our 2022 proposed budget includes the addition of 4.5 Ftes . We will discuss those in the coming slides as we go into our highlights and changes to the proposed budget.",54,,
293,0.97,1650.081,1655.687,Next slide.,55,,

299,0.97,1690.321,1712.677,"As you all know, Edi is project managing 46 projects including 21 new projects . We also anticipate this assignment to the management of 11 new investment front concepts for land acquisition.",57,,
300,0.97,1712.677,1728.526,The grants and contacts manager will administer the grant processes and the contact folks for the Edi and investment front including compliance.,57,,
301,0.97,1728.526,1730.762,There are two new planning and community development positions for Edi.,57,,
302,0.97,1730.762,1739.671,Those take on new Edi and Pre- funded projects and absorb projects from other managers who are currently overcapacity.,57,,
303,0.97,1739.671,1751.683,We also have doubled the number of Federal contacts from 2021.,57,,
304,0.97,1751.683,1766.664,"Also, we anticipate to see a larger contract in 2022 as a result of the additional funding.",57,,
305,0.97,1766.664,1773.505,That is why Opcd and Edi is looking for those three new positions.,57,,
306,0.97,1773.505,1794.359,I also want to add this is something that we have discussed with our Advisory board who is open to making sure that the Sustainability of the program works and is open to the percentage of Admin's going into project management.,57,,

317,0.97,1846.144,1861.559,"This includes a $220,000 increase in the proposed budget on top of the 130,000 that is already in our baseline budget for 2021.",61,,
318,0.97,1861.559,1878.409,"The important thing to consider with respect to the project is that the total project budget over the full three years, including anticipated 2023 funds is $425,000 for the Eif and $150,000 for the community engagement.",61,,
319,0.97,1878.409,1885.116,Opcd is currently preparing to launch the update this fall.,61,,

The focuses our resources on reaching out to them Partnering with Bicop and other marginalized communities and supports a racial equity Toolkit.,61,,
323,0.97,1920.251,1926.157,"With respect to the Eif, we expect this company has a plan process to address the first major update of the city's urban village strategies which was adopted in 1994.",61,,
324,0.97,1926.157,1945.276,"With that in mind and for this Eif, we anticipate there being a wider range of alternatives to where and how the city grows over the next several decades including alternatives that are informed by recently completed racial equity analysis of our current Seattle 2035 plan.",61,,
325,0.97,1945.276,1954.852,I am going to turn to the regional growth center area planning which is related to the Apprehensive plan that I will explain.,61,,

332,0.97,2006.27,2013.111,The intent here is to support long range and equitable recovery and vitality for these important places in the city.,61,,
333,0.97,2013.111,2017.749,Why are we taking this on now?,61,,
334,0.97,2017.749,2025.656,Regional policy adopted over the last several years establishes a requirement that cities have updated area plans in place by 2025.,61,,
335,0.97,2025.656,2041.939,"We have been working closely with staff, which will review nd certify the adoptive plans to identify that there is a significant body of work that is needed for the city of Seattle.",61,,
336,0.97,2041.939,2047.912,"Just as important, this work will bring our neighborhood plans for the centers, most of which are a couple of decades old, current and relevant to the challenges ahead.",61,,
337,0.97,2047.912,2052.483,"Rico, do you want to add anything?",61,,
338,0.97,2052.483,2052.884,I would.,62,,
339,0.97,2052.884,2054.986,"Thank you, Michael.",62,,
340,0.97,2054.986,2150.248,"A couple of other things I would note . One related to the comprehensive plan major update . You heard Michael make a reference to the $150,000 budget that we have for community engagement over the course of the next three years . What we are aware of is that we are in a new climate than we were a couple of years ago . with the tragedy of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many others and the racial awakening and reckoning that the nation is dealing with, what we know as we look at the update is that there is an enhanced level of community engagement that we need to reach out into communities to hear from the people all that we are trying to represent and that we are trying to serve well to get an understanding of how we need to affect change with our comprehensive plan and plan for the future and reconcile some of the very challenging paths we have from a policy standpoint or other policy restrictions that have made generational wealth not possible for many of our Bicop communities.",62,,
341,0.97,2150.248,2158.756,"That budget that we have now--well, I will say this.",62,,
342,0.97,2158.756,2161.259,We will do everything we can with the resources that we are provided.,62,,
343,0.97,2161.259,2167.265,We are grateful for what we have in front of us currently.,62,,
344,0.97,2167.265,2185.917,"What we do know, particularly related to the discussions with the city and the work we have been doing to try to compensate the community for involvement in extended planning efforts and community engagement efforts.",62,,
345,0.97,2185.917,2192.023,The budget that we have currently did not originally contemplate that level of reimbursement.,62,,
346,0.97,2192.023,2201.799,Those are some things we've got to figure out and that will take some time.,62,,
347,0.97,2201.799,2203.234,There are multiple departments that are doing that.,62,,
348,0.97,2203.234,2208.105,We are certainly no exception.,62,,
349,0.97,2208.105,2239.57,"Related to regional growth center and sub area planning, very excited to have $150,000 in the proposed budget to be some start up funds to kickoff the sub area planning that we need to do . As you heard Michael state, we have six Subarea plans--from the way I have been looking at it, we really need to run the planning parallel to the Foundational comprehensive plan major update.",62,,
350,0.97,2239.57,2252.783,"That regional growth center Subarea planning is supplemental and complimentary but what I am saying is, it is additional work.",62,,
351,0.97,2252.783,2269.867,"There is a much larger budget beyond the $150,000 that we need to look at over the course of the next three years . This is enough to get us started but we will want to be in conversation with Council to know what the effort needs to look like moving forward.",62,,
352,0.97,2269.867,2270.735,"Next slide, please.",62,,
353,0.97,2270.735,2279.21,"These last two items, I will speak to.",63,,
354,0.97,2279.21,2296.427,We are very excited by the additional funding that is in the proposed budget . We were adding $2.5 million to expand our existing Valley program.,63,,
355,0.97,2296.427,2321.352,"The funding includes new program coordinator positions and part of the enhanced community engagement and best community assets including the community center, neighborhood center, Georgetown gathering spaces and community support developments at the two electric sites were out last week for a great President to talk about this work.",63,,
356,0.97,2321.352,2336.667,"The work is intended to foster climate and community resilience, provide opportunities for youth and advance a range of community requirements documented in the Duwamish Valley action plan.",63,,
357,0.97,2336.667,2350.481,We are close to coordinating both what Osc and Sdot regarding this work as well as what other outside agencies have budget for the program.,63,,
358,0.97,2350.481,2352.95,You have probably heard me speak about this need before.,63,,
359,0.97,2352.95,2359.857,We have talked about in Digitizing the COMP plan.,63,,
360,0.97,2359.857,2366.997,We really had a strong need to have a plan there within our staff as a permanent position.,63,,
361,0.97,2366.997,2390.921,We have an indigenous Seattle programmer where we have interns come in for a short period of time every year for a number of months but having a full time position to help us develop Frameworks and processes for incorporating indigenous planning concepts into our work and to our community development is really critical.,63,,
362,0.97,2390.921,2406.937,"That position will also expand the city's planning approach and increase our ability to engage with that indigenous Seattle work . and, our engagement of indigenous Seattle residents.",63,,
363,0.97,2406.937,2422.219,"The intent is to enable the city to transform--or, transition to the Erasure of native American culture and experiences to instead, a process where indigenous Methodologies are incorporated and implemented in our work.",63,,
364,0.97,2422.219,2423.087,Next slide.,63,,
365,0.97,2423.087,2447.178,"So, looking at our work through a racial equity frame, $17 million in new investments seek to advance our work to combat systemic racism, eliminate racial disparities, and support racial equity.",64,,
366,0.97,2447.178,2471.569,"As we have already discussed, we have the Edi dollars to the tune of the additional $14.3 million . hour Duwamish Valley program work and the additional $2.5 million . Then, the COMP plan outreach and engagement, an additional $50,000.",64,,
367,0.97,2471.569,2475.239,"The indigenous planning position, $159,000.",64,,
368,0.97,2475.239,2495.125,"Equitable development zoning, this one for $25,000 is work we are doing currently and will continue in 2022 to address barriers in our land use and zoning regulations that make it difficult for Edi and other affordable housing and of element projects to succeed.",64,,
369,0.97,2495.125,2524.755,"Hour training for staff internally is $26,000 this year and that is also planning Commission and training . Then, real estate data, $13,000 . that is to increase monitoring of displacement and community supporter and inform policy development and planning strategies.",64,,
370,0.97,2524.755,2527.558,I believe that was our last slide.,64,,
371,0.97,2527.558,2531.362,"With that, I would open up for questions.",64,,
372,0.97,2531.362,2534.999,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda.,64,,
373,0.97,2534.999,2536.567,Thank you.,65,,
374,0.97,2536.567,2552.182,There is a lot of interest on Council in making sure that we get to some of these Promisee's . I am going to thank you for your time and I see three people in the lineup.,65,,
375,0.97,2552.182,2559.256,"We will go Councilmember Strauss, thank you.",65,,
376,0.97,2559.256,2564.395,"Councilmember Herbold, I see was well.",66,,
377,0.97,2564.395,2568.065,"Thank you for the Graciousness, Councilmember Juarez.",67,,
378,0.97,2568.065,2570.935,"Patty, could you put the slide backup?",67,,
379,0.97,2570.935,2579.41,My questions are connected to the Slideshow.,67,,
380,0.97,2579.41,2582.279,Did you have any comments you would like to say?,68,,
381,0.97,2582.279,2586.317,You are more than happy to as well.,68,,
382,0.97,2586.317,2601.932,"It has been a pleasure to get to work with you all . You all do amazing work . I just want to make sure that we are allocating you appropriate resources that you need to be successful with your work, especially as the major update is coming.",69,,
383,0.97,2601.932,2618.949,"Coming on slide two, I just want to confirm that this $14.3 million for Edi is all additive from Jumpstart and that is in line with the spending priorities outlined by Council . has there been a change made?",69,,
384,0.97,2618.949,2628.792,This should say general fund.,70,,
385,0.97,2628.792,2633.263,That is applying the formula with the legislation.,70,,
386,0.97,2633.263,2650.08,"This is the funding target for 2022 under the Jumpstart ordinance for Edi . It is not the only funding that goes to Edi but for your specific question, yes.",70,,
387,0.97,2650.08,2651.882,"To answer that specific question, it is yes?",71,,
388,0.97,2651.882,2652.883,Yes.,72,,
389,0.97,2652.883,2653.751,Great.,73,,
390,0.97,2653.751,2656.987,Want to hear it is in line with the spending priorities.,73,,
391,0.97,2656.987,2659.056,And now I know it is additive.,73,,
392,0.97,2659.056,2661.091,Thank you.,73,,
393,0.97,2661.091,2683.147,"Staying on this slide for a minute, based on the Opcd's presentation last week, we anticipated allocating $450,000 toward comprehensive plan outreach and inclusion over three years . that would leave $200,000 for work on the impact statement.",73,,
394,0.97,2683.147,2687.284,Do I recall this correctly or has it been changed since last Tuesday?,73,,
395,0.97,2687.284,2690.721,There has not been a change since the last time we reviewed the numbers.,74,,
396,0.97,2690.721,2690.988,Okay.,75,,
397,0.97,2690.988,2695.793,"If I may, a point of clarification.",76,,
398,0.97,2695.793,2711.442,"Over the full three years for the project, it is $150,000 for community engagement and $425,000 total for the EIS for the three years for the project.",76,,
399,0.97,2711.442,2716.747,Okay.,77,,
400,0.97,2716.747,2724.354,"So, is that where the budget also indicates additional funding of $575,000 for the 2023 budget?",77,,
401,0.97,2724.354,2730.961,"If not, would you like to elaborate on that?",77,,
402,0.97,2730.961,2737.367,"Melissa, maybe you could Chime in to help explain the raising of the budget over the three budget cycles?",78,,
403,0.97,2737.367,2746.777,Sure.,79,,
404,0.97,2746.777,2750.047,"For the COMP plan budget, it is estimated to be $575,000 total, spread over three years.",79,,
405,0.97,2750.047,2751.682,"We had $130,000 in 2021, this year.",79,,
406,0.97,2751.682,2757.955,"We will have $350,000 in 2022 and the final $95,000 will be 2023.",79,,
407,0.97,2757.955,2767.764,"That all adds up to the $575,000 for the COMP plan overall major update.",79,,
408,0.97,2767.764,2768.966,That is helpful Equivocation.,80,,
409,0.97,2768.966,2773.604,I may follow-up off-line with more questions.,80,,
410,0.97,2773.604,2779.71,"Staying on this slide, I know that in previous major update cycles, the city received a higher amount of funding.",80,,
411,0.97,2779.71,2791.088,"Is $150,000 over three years sufficient for the robust outreach and engagement process similar to the comprehensive plan outreach? What would fully funding that project look like?",80,,
412,0.97,2791.088,2797.995,"If you are not at liberty to answer, I am happy to take the answer from Ben noble.",80,,
413,0.97,2797.995,2807.437,"I will take a pass . Ben, if you have additional comments you would like to make, please.",81,,
414,0.97,2807.437,2850.781,"My perspective--I believe as we look at engagement of both community liaisons and community organizations, that we will engage, we will do everything we can with limited budget that we have . The simple reality is with the number of people we are trying to reach out to, the number of neighborhoods that we are trying to get into the discussion, if we had a greater level of resources, we would put it to greater use.",81,,
415,0.97,2850.781,2872.502,"We have a draft outline that Michael has put together regarding how we would allocate that $150,000 over the three years . We certainly have the ability to identify where there are what--I don't know how else to characterize it.",81,,
416,0.97,2872.502,2904.801,"Where there are some gaps, we have been doing eight robust coordination with Sdot related to the Seattle transportation plan and the 1.5 that they have for a similar time period for community engagement to figure out where we align our efforts, where we plug in . that has also allowed us to identify where there are some gaps that we could fill.",81,,
417,0.97,2904.801,2919.716,"It sounds like at least $150,000 would be a start for this year and I will be continuing to watch this process to make sure that we have an appropriate amount of funding for the outreach that is required for such a large upkeep.",82,,
418,0.97,2919.716,2924.922,"Major updates only happen out of cycle, once every four years at minimum.",82,,
419,0.97,2924.922,2937.934,"If I might, that was exactly the perspective of the executive in bringing the core proposal.",83,,
420,0.97,2937.934,2944.041,We recognize that we are financially constrained at the moment as we are in recovery mode.,83,,
421,0.97,2944.041,2953.984,"As Rico Quirindongo mentioned, he is in discussion with other leaders about the overall outreach effort and a variety of major fronts.",83,,
422,0.97,2953.984,2971.868,"This is the most comprehensive by definition but we do have Sdot out and there is a potential opportunity to--in terms of engagement, to figure out how to streamline those efforts if there may be a side benefit.",83,,
423,0.97,2971.868,2984.414,"We recognize that as the process continues, there might be the need for additional resources.",83,,
424,0.97,2984.414,2986.917,The budget for 2022 is put together in a constrained environment.,83,,
425,0.97,2986.917,2987.284,Excellent.,84,,
426,0.97,2987.284,2988.318,We will stay connected on this.,84,,
427,0.97,2988.318,2993.99,"In the past, council adopted alternatives to our current strategy.",84,,
428,0.97,2993.99,3007.604,Do you have sufficient funding at this time for the comprehensive plan with EIS but will allow the city to consider appropriate changes to zoning?,84,,
429,0.97,3007.604,3010.207,"In particular, single families in residential areas?",84,,
430,0.97,3010.207,3021.218,I will have your address Councilmember Strauss' question.,85,,
431,0.97,3021.218,3046.176,"Before we do that, I would also say regarding the community engagement balance, as Ben had just mentioned, we are looking at a framework and how, across multiple departments, we can maximize resource and how we engage community.",85,,
432,0.97,3046.176,3068.999,Part of the discussion I'm interested in continuing in 22 is to what extent can we potentially establish some standard framework that we share related to how we compensate community in our community engagement processes.,85,,
433,0.97,3068.999,3080.71,I am concerned about how that comes back and hits our budget line item . that is just another piece that I have a critical eye on.,85,,
434,0.97,3080.71,3085.782,"Michael, do you want to address Councilmember Strauss' question there?",85,,
435,0.97,3085.782,3089.886,Certainly.,86,,
436,0.97,3089.886,3091.788,The sun is coming through my window there.,86,,
437,0.97,3091.788,3093.523,Apologies.,86,,
438,0.97,3093.523,3118.982,"I think I can be helpful in explaining that the $425,000 should be thought of as a base budget, if you will . for a point of comparison, the EIS for the last conference a plan update, the full cost was a bit more than that, around $500,000.",86,,
439,0.97,3118.982,3122.552,"That was a number of years ago in 2014, 2015 Timeframe.",86,,
440,0.97,3122.552,3130.126,Our approach to this is we are going to go into this and Precure consultants support this year.,86,,
441,0.97,3130.126,3132.729,We are going to work within the budget that we have.,86,,
442,0.97,3132.729,3171.701,"Through that process, and as we consider our multiple needs and the desire to get the more bang for our buck from this environmental analysis project--what I mean by that is we are looking at a wide range of alternatives which includes looking at potential roles going forward or new roles for urban centers and villages, for station areas when planning our light rail, for potentially new areas of the city and complete and equitable 15 minute neighborhoods and looking broadly at new roles for single family areas across the city.",86,,
443,0.97,3171.701,3174.771,That is a lot to analyze.,86,,
444,0.97,3174.771,3186.516,We also know that there will be a lot of attention around climate impacts and equity and displacement impacts . those are additional Analytical pieces in the work.,86,,
445,0.97,3186.516,3192.022,We also know that there may be significant code of element to implement the plan when we get to the finish line.,86,,
446,0.97,3192.022,3199.529,All of those pieces--we anticipate there will be some cost implications of those.,86,,
447,0.97,3199.529,3210.74,"The $425,000 is the base but there may be cost drivers to address all of the other actors and policy issues going forward . We can get back to you to let you know what that looks like.",86,,
448,0.97,3210.74,3211.141,Okay.,87,,
449,0.97,3211.141,3217.447,That is helpful.,87,,
450,0.97,3217.447,3221.051,"My last question on this slide, I see your budget includes new funding for growth center planning.",87,,
451,0.97,3221.051,3238.368,I am not sure we have had robust discussion on this project . can you elaborate what this project is and maybe take a sub bullet to help me understand that there is sufficient funding to do what you want to do?,87,,
452,0.97,3238.368,3243.673,"I will start off and Michael, you can weigh in.",88,,
453,0.97,3243.673,3277.974,"If you look at our urban village map, we have six Subareas that the Puget sound regional Council in 2018 adopted a requirement where the city of Seattle now needs to create they plan around each of those Subareas that then gets tied back to transportation dollars that the city receives.",88,,
454,0.97,3277.974,3294.024,"The Timeline for completion of those six--Michael, correct me if I am wrong--is not explicitly aligned with comprehensive major plan updates.",88,,
455,0.97,3294.024,3319.816,"However, when we look at the requirement of the Subarea planning of the requirement for the COMP plan major updates, there are some overlaps and deficiencies there which will also be achieved by running that work parallel to the Seattle transportation plan work . Our hope--first, there is a need . There is a need that was not compensated.",88,,
456,0.97,3319.816,3349.112,"It has not been compensated in previous city of Seattle budgeting . It is a new cost . I think that Councilmember Strauss, to the extent that your Committee has an interest in seeing it, there is a larger three year plan that we could talk about that in my mind, looked at investing in two Subarea plans a year, what is the level of costs related to that.",88,,
457,0.97,3349.112,3373.403,"The $150,000 is really just a smaller dollar amount that allows us to ring a consultant on board to begin Flushing out that plan for the six Subarea plans . There is a substantial amount of work to do there that is supplemental to the base COMP plan major update work.",88,,
458,0.97,3373.403,3375.805,"Is there anything you want to add to that, Michael?",88,,
459,0.97,3375.805,3376.673,Yeah.,89,,
460,0.97,3376.673,3396.626,"Perhaps this puts a fine point on it but I think there is a city driven need and a regional responsibility piece to this as to why we are taking this on now . As Rico was explaining, there is a regional expectation.",89,,
461,0.97,3396.626,3479.876,"I know that Councilmember Strauss has been engaged in the process and the regional center's framework, which was the original policy change in a Timeframe for doing very specific and Place-Based planning around the regional growth centers . This was established then and further codified . What we want to do as a city and as an office is do the work that is commensurate with what other cities in the center are doing . It puts us in a good position to maintain eligibility for Federal transportation dollars and ground research with competitive processes each year . In 2025, the regional Council will be reviewing all of the centers and the plans and certifying those plans . If the city were not to have those plans at that point in time, it could put some of that funding accessibility at risk.",89,,
462,0.97,3479.876,3488.017,"Internally, we also know that looking at the company has a plans, the neighborhood plans--we have neighborhood planning policies in the COMP plan for downtown, Northgate.",89,,
463,0.97,3488.017,3493.723,We have policies in the plan right now but they are really old.,89,,
464,0.97,3493.723,3505.235,They are truly not very meaningful at this point in time and looking forward.,89,,
465,0.97,3505.235,3515.211,We have the city as well to have fresh fines with that community around the center specific policies.,89,,
466,0.97,3515.211,3521.184,A lot of the growth will be centered.,89,,
467,0.97,3521.184,3528.024,It will require staffing which we are trying to step up as well as budget for consultants.,89,,
468,0.97,3528.024,3529.425,Thank you.,90,,
469,0.97,3529.425,3530.426,Quite helpful.,90,,
470,0.97,3530.426,3534.664,Please let me know.,90,,
471,0.97,3534.664,3554.384,"These are Longer-Range plans than this budget, which is just for the next year . Patty, if you could advance to slide three, this is not really a question but more of a common.",90,,
472,0.97,3554.384,3566.896,My stop has met a few times with residents advocating for more resources for the Duwamish Valley action plan . Just making a note that calling up my appreciation that this is included in the Mayor's budget.,90,,
473,0.97,3566.896,3572.502,"Think you . slide four, if you could, Patty.",90,,
474,0.97,3572.502,3580.61,I will only ask two more questions and then I will let my colleagues ask questions as well.,90,,
475,0.97,3580.61,3593.323,"Just understanding the $50,000 for COMP plan outreach, is this additive to the earlier total or is this the $50,000 that was set aside specifically for engagement with Bicop communities?",90,,
476,0.97,3593.323,3609.038,"There is $100,000 and this $50,000 for next year . that is the $150,000 total.",91,,
477,0.97,3609.038,3611.307,So a subsection?,92,,
478,0.97,3611.307,3615.011,Correct.,93,,
479,0.97,3615.011,3617.013,"So, slide five is general questions.",93,,
480,0.97,3617.013,3632.428,"Bringing up, you have long discussed completed the crown Hill community action plan in time for Council to adopt plan resolution this December.",93,,
481,0.97,3632.428,3633.83,I just wanted to check in.,93,,
482,0.97,3633.83,3635.665,What is the current status of the reaction plan?,93,,
483,0.97,3635.665,3636.666,Is it on track?,93,,
484,0.97,3636.666,3638.067,It is on track.,94,,
485,0.97,3638.067,3645.375,Great . do you have the resources you need to develop the design guidelines next year?,95,,
486,0.97,3645.375,3652.148,That is in our work for 2022.,96,,
487,0.97,3652.148,3653.349,Thank you.,97,,
488,0.97,3653.349,3661.457,I have some other questions but I will hold them because I have a feeling my colleagues might ask the same questions.,97,,
489,0.97,3661.457,3662.959,Thank you very much.,98,,
490,0.97,3662.959,3664.494,Councilmember Morales?,98,,
491,0.97,3664.494,3671.601,Thank you very much . please go ahead.,98,,
492,0.97,3671.601,3672.402,Thank you.,99,,
493,0.97,3672.402,3674.704,"Good morning, everybody.",99,,
494,0.97,3674.704,3685.214,I want to first acknowledge that I don't actually sit on this Committee . forgive me if I am asking questions that you have already presented on.,99,,
495,0.97,3685.214,3693.99,I do have a couple of questions and then I have a couple of line item questions.,99,,
496,0.97,3693.99,3695.792,"So, let's see.",99,,
497,0.97,3695.792,3706.736,I want to first--we are talking so much about the COMP plan so I will start there.,99,,
498,0.97,3706.736,3720.149,I want to give a shout out to the planning Commission who has been providing recommendations that city planners and our leaders really engage in principles that reduce barriers created by forms of oppression.,99,,
499,0.97,3720.149,3726.456,We know that this Department in particular has a lot of harm to repair because of our city's past practices.,99,,
500,0.97,3726.456,3744.54,"I appreciate that you are all engaging with the planning Commission and particularly Edi, doing a lot of important work there . As we move into the COMP plan process, I think it will be important in the discussion that we have had about community engagement.",99,,
501,0.97,3744.54,3749.178,It is something I am very interested in.,99,,
502,0.97,3749.178,3761.591,The COMP plan--we are starting the EIS process.,99,,
503,0.97,3761.591,3766.596,Folks in this Eid are very frustrated because they will be engaging in two processes given that the sound transit is also happening.,99,,
504,0.97,3766.596,3781.31,One of the questions that kept coming up and this question is around community engagement and translation services.,99,,
505,0.97,3781.31,3796.993,"If you have this level of detail right now, I am very interested to know what the budget is for translating documents, for providing translation services through the engagement process as you move forward there.",99,,
506,0.97,3796.993,3821.317,"Maybe what I will do is ask if it is possible for us to have a more fleshed out understanding, a table, a chart to see how this $575,000 is being planned over the entire phase of the COMP plan process rather than Year-By-Year because it is hard to understand what is going on.",99,,
507,0.97,3821.317,3832.862,"It sounds to me that you are saving the $150,000 is not sufficient.",99,,
508,0.97,3832.862,3852.381,"I would like to know what you think is sufficient to make sure that we are doing this the right way . As you know, this work affects the environment and the people who live and work in it . It is how the people who are going to experience this long-term--they are my priority.",99,,
509,0.97,3852.381,3860.523,We need to make sure they can engage in this process in a meaningful way.,99,,
510,0.97,3860.523,3869.665,If you have an estimate of what you think it would do to do this right--I think this is a question Council member Strauss asked but I would like to hear the answer.,99,,
511,0.97,3869.665,3871.834,I would say a couple of things.,100,,
512,0.97,3871.834,3887.116,"First around translation services, I don't have a number I can identify at the moment . I can say, as a follow-up to this meeting--you just have to tell me how quickly we can turn it around.",100,,
513,0.97,3887.116,3910.039,"We can provide you a breakdown that shows the $575,000, how it is spread out currently over the three-year period and how it is broken down, what each case represents.",100,,
514,0.97,3910.039,3911.774,That should be a pretty straightforward exercise for us.,100,,
515,0.97,3911.774,3913.776,We can do that in the form of a table.,100,,
516,0.97,3913.776,3942.738,"When we do that--it would also be an opportunity for us to identify that in working with Sdot and looking at our shared community engagement strategy, we can identify gaps within that that would provide additional funding.",100,,
517,0.97,3942.738,3946.676,Okay.,101,,
518,0.97,3946.676,3949.278,I will say additional funding opportunities.,101,,
519,0.97,3949.278,3962.091,"I understand . If we are talking about authentic community engagement, that takes money.",102,,
520,0.97,3962.091,3962.625,People need Childcare.,102,,
521,0.97,3962.625,3964.493,They need food if they are coming to evening meetings.,102,,
522,0.97,3964.493,3966.896,They need translation services if they come from certain communities.,102,,
523,0.97,3966.896,3971.6,They should be compensated for their time and expertise that they are contributing to our decision-making process.,102,,
524,0.97,3971.6,3976.505,I totally get that this is an expensive proposition.,102,,
525,0.97,3976.505,3992.788,"When we are talking about things that are going to impact the way neighborhoods look for generations to come, it is an investment we need to be willing to make . I don't think you need to be afraid of telling us how much it will cost.",102,,
526,0.97,3992.788,4000.296,I think we need to be prepared for that figure and then figure out how we are going to do it.,102,,
527,0.97,4000.296,4007.937,"Moving on, I want to talk about--I feel like you have been talking about this all week.",103,,
528,0.97,4007.937,4010.439,I will ask one more time to see if I can get clarity.,103,,
529,0.97,4010.439,4012.575,It is the Edi and the investment fund.,103,,
530,0.97,4012.575,4027.456,"First, I want to say, just to clear up the record, what we have proposed right now for Edi is $14 million . that is not what was in the spend plan for Jumpstart.",103,,
531,0.97,4027.456,4028.724,I want to clear that up.,103,,
532,0.97,4028.724,4047.576,The spend plan indicated 9% given the expected revenue that would be more like $21 million for Edi . I think--what I am trying to understand here--I understand where Edi came from.,103,,
533,0.97,4047.576,4049.645,That is a process.,103,,
534,0.97,4049.645,4056.619,I was part of that process when I was participating in South Florida.,103,,
535,0.97,4056.619,4061.19,"Communities developed the idea, that it it on the proposed it to Council.",103,,
536,0.97,4061.19,4062.191,It has been a long process.,103,,
537,0.97,4062.191,4074.27,The Edi board just got seated after years of advocacy . It is clear to me where that came from and why it is so important for us to invest in that.,103,,
538,0.97,4074.27,4079.742,I think that this is not Antiracist strategy.,103,,
539,0.97,4079.742,4087.383,It is very intentional about Wringing community in and seating power and Decision- making to community.,103,,
540,0.97,4087.383,4104.5,That is authentic community engagement . It is as authentic a process as I have seen from the city so I am really excited we are doing A. I think we should be really proud as a city that that is what we are doing.,103,,
541,0.97,4104.5,4108.337,It is frankly why I fought so hard to make sure that the investment from Jumpstart was included.,103,,
542,0.97,4108.337,4130.659,"What I don't understand is the expansion of the strategic investment fund . that is something that was created as a One-Off because of the sale of the Mercer MEGA block . It seems to me that if what our real goal here is to expand the opportunity to invest in community driven project, then we already have that.",103,,
543,0.97,4130.659,4153.182,We have Edi . I would prefer to see an increase in staff and resources for Edi to expand their Antiracist work than to try to duplicate what that is in a way that does not engage the process the way Edi did.,103,,
544,0.97,4153.182,4158.087,"All of that is to say, I would rather see us build up Edi then try to locate something.",103,,
545,0.97,4158.087,4176.605,We need to be really careful about creating new pots of money and new programs without that authentic engagement to support it . I do think that is in direct conflict with Antiracist principles.,103,,
546,0.97,4176.605,4205.501,I know that is not really a question but it is important for us to pause throughout this process and think about how we can achieve the goals that we are aiming for but do it in a way that is strategic and honors the work that the community has done and that is fiscally responsible.,103,,
547,0.97,4205.501,4209.705,"If what we are saying is that different departments need more staffing to do their work well, that is a different question.",103,,
548,0.97,4209.705,4219.848,I will stop there to see if you want to respond or see if I should go on.,103,,
549,0.97,4219.848,4222.952,"Councilmember, before I speak, I know that both directors may have some comments.",104,,
550,0.97,4222.952,4225.554,I do have three other people in the Queue.,104,,
551,0.97,4225.554,4233.462,"There was an important, you have made to put on the record so we can have that as a central piece rest to come back to as we see our priorities.",104,,
552,0.97,4233.462,4241.67,"I want to make sure that the value statement that you have--it is an important, and you have.",104,,
553,0.97,4241.67,4244.373,I just don't want to necessarily debate that comment right now.,104,,
554,0.97,4244.373,4246.242,Okay.,105,,
555,0.97,4246.242,4249.244,I did have one other question about my district if I could.,106,,
556,0.97,4249.244,4252.982,Okay.,107,,
557,0.97,4252.982,4256.885,I will ask you to throw out your question quickly and then we will move on to Councilmember Juarez.,107,,
558,0.97,4256.885,4257.586,There enough.,108,,
559,0.97,4257.586,4264.493,We have to $.5 million in the Duwamish program . It is exciting to see.,108,,
560,0.97,4264.493,4267.396,It includes the Southpark community center and Southpark Neighbored center any Georgetown gathering space.,108,,
561,0.97,4267.396,4278.007,I am interested in what ever and she hates those kinds of spaces . We would certainly love to have a Georgetown community center or neighborhood center as well.,108,,
562,0.97,4278.007,4287.616,"My other question around that is, how are you working to build a relationship with Duwamish tribal services as you invest in this work around that?",108,,
563,0.97,4287.616,4293.622,Thank you.,108,,
564,0.97,4293.622,4295.324,"Please go ahead, director.",109,,
565,0.97,4295.324,4297.426,Thank you.,110,,
566,0.97,4297.426,4350.245,"If I can take a step back for 30 seconds to make a note . The Edi team drove the investment fund process that we engaged instead of the community advisory group this year . Our conversation around 2022 is that the $5 million of base funding and the $14.3 million of payroll tax Jumpstart funding, we are treating that as one bucket and one effort with one team . hopefully that will better address that concern.",110,,
567,0.97,4350.245,4351.28,Let me say one more.,111,,
568,0.97,4351.28,4352.281,I am hoping to clarify.,111,,
569,0.97,4352.281,4354.083,I may have been a source of confusion.,111,,
570,0.97,4354.083,4355.35,We agree on the executive side.,111,,
571,0.97,4355.35,4358.42,We are not proposing we continue the strategic investment fund as its own Standalone thing.,111,,
572,0.97,4358.42,4360.389,It was a one-time allocation of resources.,111,,
573,0.97,4360.389,4373.602,"We are saying that there is $30 million total, half of which is going to Edi . that is the right thing.",111,,
574,0.97,4373.602,4386.215,Why have two separate processes that cover largely the same space? I'm not saying it is identical but certainly the staff can work to craft an approach that captures the principles of both to the extent they are different.,111,,
575,0.97,4386.215,4404.433,"That is the idea . The Council's respective on increasing the Edi ongoing allocation is consistent with the ideas that we are underlying the one-time strategic investment fund . In some ways, it is a labeling thing.",111,,
576,0.97,4404.433,4408.704,Do you have an answer to that second question?,112,,
577,0.97,4408.704,4412.207,Sure.,113,,
578,0.97,4412.207,4418.514,I appreciate your question around the Duwamish Valley investments.,113,,
579,0.97,4418.514,4435.364,I would love to have a more expansive discussion . I would bring David Goldberg and Alberto in to talk about that program overall.,113,,
580,0.97,4435.364,4461.79,"My deputy director and I were a part of a University of Washington studio wellness tribal services earlier this year to talk about their needs and planning efforts . The short version is there is a lot to talk about, which I am super excited about.",113,,
581,0.97,4461.79,4463.492,We had a little planning session yesterday.,113,,
582,0.97,4463.492,4490.419,"I think we could put together some materials to line up the conversations we have all been having and take a look at the opportunities we have with the dollars that are in play and what has come through one strategic lens, if that makes any sense . I am 100% on board there.",113,,
583,0.97,4490.419,4491.42,Thank you very much.,114,,
584,0.97,4491.42,4496.091,We are going to go to Councilmember Juarez and then Gonzalez.,114,,
585,0.97,4496.091,4497.926,Thank you.,115,,
586,0.97,4497.926,4502.931,I was just going to make a few comments.,115,,
587,0.97,4502.931,4508.203,Councilmember Morales made a point I was going to underscore.,115,,
588,0.97,4508.203,4529.825,"First of all, thank you so much--I just want to share that Opcd was the first city Department to use the indigent iced and Decolonization language, ever in the history of this city, which has never happened.",115,,
589,0.97,4529.825,4530.859,"It is really, really important.",115,,
590,0.97,4530.859,4538.567,"The city of Seattle traditionally would have an indigenous and native person in the executive, never on the legislative side.",115,,
591,0.97,4538.567,4557.819,Having the indigenous planner is going to work Phenomenally well and dovetail with the indigenous advisor Council that this council passed and now we are in the middle of passing the ordinance for that staff are to be on the Department of neighborhoods.,115,,
592,0.97,4557.819,4560.989,"The question that Councilmember Morales asked, all of those three individuals will work together.",115,,
593,0.97,4560.989,4574.503,"We will be Holistic of indigenous knowledge, the Colonization piece, government to government relations, strengthening our relationships with local tribes and urban Indian organizations.",115,,
594,0.97,4574.503,4581.41,We take that out of the one person that gets dropped into the executive or in on the legislative.,115,,
595,0.97,4581.41,4612.608,"That is a wonderful, wonderful legacy to continue and for us as the city Council to be proud of . I just want to say that, as you know, Sam was the first city director to have a four part series about indigenous in the history of Seattle with historian scholars and some phenomenal intellectuals nationally . He imparted all of the knowledge to Bake into Opcd.",115,,
596,0.97,4612.608,4613.909,No with the city has done that.,115,,
597,0.97,4613.909,4617.746,I want to thank you for the legacy that you are continuing.,115,,
598,0.97,4617.746,4624.252,"When I was making a joke about how Elders go first, that is where we got started.",115,,
599,0.97,4624.252,4633.862,"As we have shared with you before, what we are learning is that you do need to leave.",115,,
600,0.97,4633.862,4638.066,"When you do leave, you leave a legacy.",115,,
601,0.97,4638.066,4646.641,I am really glad you are working with Duwamish and all of the other tribes and native American organizations.,115,,
602,0.97,4646.641,4648.243,I think we have come a long way.,115,,
603,0.97,4648.243,4648.644,Thank you.,115,,
604,0.97,4648.644,4650.679,"And, I might apply for that job.",115,,
605,0.97,4650.679,4651.279,I don't know.,115,,
606,0.97,4651.279,4653.949,I am just thinking about it.,115,,
607,0.97,4653.949,4654.983,Thank you.,116,,
608,0.97,4654.983,4658.186,Councilmember Herbold?,116,,
609,0.97,4658.186,4664.493,Thank you very much.,117,,
610,0.97,4664.493,4671.6,"As I am sure is anticipated by our friends at Opcd, I do have some questions about the Duwamish Valley program funding.",117,,
611,0.97,4671.6,4700.929,I am really excited about the investments that are being proposed to make a reality in a more expedited fashion . Just some questions that I have been asking around the funds associated with the unity elect site.,117,,
612,0.97,4700.929,4709.538,"One, is the intention for those funds to be operation or capital dollars?",117,,
613,0.97,4709.538,4729.257,"One of the reasons why I am asking is recently, the Council authorized the purchase of a parcel for $3.9 million but with only $1 million in hand with the understanding that potentially we could get full funding from the conservation futures funding in County.",117,,
614,0.97,4729.257,4742.137,They have made it clear that the money would only be available after the unity conversations which have not happened to the extent they would need to happen.,117,,
615,0.97,4742.137,4748.977,It appears that the $1 million may be coming from either parks or Edi.,117,,
616,0.97,4748.977,4760.355,Just wondering if the intention of part of this $2.3 million to cover the remaining gap in funding.,117,,
617,0.97,4760.355,4764.059,"The other question is, what is the time for the community conversation.",117,,
618,0.97,4764.059,4802.397,"I want to note that soon after we voted in the parks Committee on the authorization of the purchase of the parcel, folks in South Park did reach out to me . They are really concerned that if we are transferring this parcel to parks that they will be in the same bind they will be in with the Plaza property, mainly that property that is in the ownership of the parks Department can only be used for parks purposes.",117,,
619,0.97,4802.397,4814.643,"The vision for this property, similar to what their vision was with the other property.",117,,
620,0.97,4814.643,4835.33,"The vision with this one is broader than a park's use . They have described it as a multipurpose building, a one- stop cultural anger where local families can access opportunities and resources, multi generational space for learning, retail, affordable Childcare.",117,,
621,0.97,4835.33,4847.776,There is another housing project . This particular sentence I just read is a goal for the acquisition of the unity property.,117,,
622,0.97,4847.776,4857.686,Maybe I should be bringing this to parks . I have done and I can do it again.,117,,
623,0.97,4857.686,4876.504,"I know that being planners, the shop at Edi and Opcd have the big picture planning goals for these projects in mind and I am guessing that they have some insight for me that I can share with the community.",117,,
624,0.97,4876.504,4877.505,Thank you.,117,,
625,0.97,4877.505,4883.678,"Councilmember, thank you for your question.",118,,
626,0.97,4883.678,4909.838,I am going to give you a pretty broad answer right now but I would say we should schedule some time for you and I to sit down with David Goldberg to talk about the breakdown of the dollars . I can't directly answer your question about the breakdown today.,118,,
627,0.97,4909.838,4915.51,There is a bunch of different project opportunities and activities with community.,118,,
628,0.97,4915.51,4928.957,I can tell you that I was down at the Duwamish Valley community a week ago yesterday meeting with community members.,118,,
629,0.97,4928.957,4939.134,There were a few of us from the city there talking about a range of issues including that whole list you just went through about opportunities.,118,,
630,0.97,4939.134,4971.7,"The other thing I can say is yes, bringing the question about the unity electric acquisition to parks is good in terms of closing the loop . This is an active conversation that Jesus and I are in regarding the stewardship of that site and understand that the intent is it is not just to be a site for traditional park use ..",118,,
631,0.97,4971.7,4989.918,Also know that there is a draft that we are working on together that would point to what future opportunities are beyond the acquisition.,118,,
632,0.97,4989.918,4990.285,Thank you.,119,,
633,0.97,4990.285,5000.228,I think we have a meeting in the works and I really appreciate your advocacy and your focus on this project.,119,,
634,0.97,5000.228,5001.896,Thank you.,120,,
635,0.97,5001.896,5008.937,"Councilmember Gonzalez, thank you for your patience as well.",121,,
636,0.97,5008.937,5009.804,My turn.,122,,
637,0.97,5009.804,5010.205,Good morning.,122,,
638,0.97,5010.205,5013.875,I have a few quick questions.,122,,
639,0.97,5013.875,5020.682,I had a series of questions around community outreach and engagement that I think we have exhausted our exploration of that area.,122,,
640,0.97,5020.682,5063.691,"I will just indicate to the Department my interest in making sure that whatever the outreach and engagement is, in terms of how it is Resourced and at what level it is Resourced, I want to encourage the Department to keep an eye looking toward how the comprehensive plan can advance the need to build truly complete neighborhoods that are--those efforts will be important to making sure we are able to eradicate some of the barriers to entry and producing more equity throughout our city.",122,,
641,0.97,5063.691,5085.78,I just wanted to Punctuate that conversation with my interest in making sure that our outreach and engagement is focused at the outcome of how we facilitate the vision around building complete neighborhoods throughout the city.,122,,
642,0.97,5085.78,5103.231,"On the tone of complete neighborhoods, I believe that a complete neighborhood--neighborhoods will remain incomplete so long as we don't center the ability to create or enhance our Childcare structure throughout the city.",122,,
643,0.97,5103.231,5130.058,"I was wondering if, Rico, you are Michael, or Whomever, can talk to us about whether or not the comprehensive plan update work that we have been discussing this morning includes any components related to how we can more easily site and how we can make more plentiful the options of having both Home- based Childcare centers in Center-Based child care options throughout our complete neighborhoods.",122,,
644,0.97,5130.058,5138.566,Thank you . that is a really good question.,123,,
645,0.97,5138.566,5160.288,"I think you probably know that our staff, and particularly our EI team, is focused on this issue and finding ways to fund Daycare center opportunities and work with those who are doing the work in that community.",123,,
646,0.97,5160.288,5175.77,"Michael Hubner, if you are still on the line, do you want to address our Council President's question briefly before I go on as I do?",123,,
647,0.97,5175.77,5176.371,Yes.,124,,
648,0.97,5176.371,5176.671,Certainly.,124,,
649,0.97,5176.671,5196.224,"Briefly, what I can say is we are very excited to be exploring this concept of complete inclusive 15 minute neighborhoods . It is potentially really engagement for communities around comprehensive plans specifically.",124,,
650,0.97,5196.224,5223.518,"It does challenge us to look at additional components of what makes a complete neighborhood, including Childcare and education . at the same time, just putting this in the context, the COMP plan is a high level policy document.",124,,
651,0.97,5223.518,5263.658,"It will not do everything we will need to do as a city to create those opportunities in all neighborhoods and communities but what we can and would be doing is looking at our land use policies as a growth strategy and how it frames the rules for different parts of the city, our neighborhood plans . at the very least, address any barriers to expanding Childcare options in neighborhoods and an endeavored to work with communities to identify what the COMP plan can do to make those opportunities real.",124,,
652,0.97,5263.658,5284.912,"Council President, I would say the only thing I would add to that--I am a recovering architect . I have always been invested in planning and then how does that strive down to single site solution?",125,,
653,0.97,5284.912,5299.027,You have to look at the Ecosystem in terms of the whole and that is related to family foundations.,125,,
654,0.97,5299.027,5307.935,We have this issue of child care and supporting working families . It is a critical piece of that discussion.,125,,
655,0.97,5307.935,5335.63,"As Michael has said, as we look at the framework that is established by the COMP plan major update and how we take pieces of that hit, our land use policy changes and then pieces of that in terms of how we put funding into the community through our Edi program and some of our other policies.",125,,
656,0.97,5335.63,5342.77,I think there is a healthy Ecosystem that we can support which is Multifaceted.,125,,
657,0.97,5342.77,5360.388,"When I look at the community of framework that Ben and I are bringing to the subcabinet, that is a place where we are trying to have the conversation for where it hits.",125,,
658,0.97,5360.388,5363.257,"Also, how it is supported by the Department's.",125,,
659,0.97,5363.257,5371.699,I guess all I wanted to say is it is a critical issue . It is totally top of mind for us.,125,,
660,0.97,5371.699,5399.193,Great . I just want to restate our support for making sure it is continuous to be part of the conversation and also that we utilize the comprehensive plan to continue to advance our shared goals and creating greater amounts of Childcare infrastructure.,126,,
661,0.97,5399.193,5412.206,I am talking about those Home- based Childcare opportunities and Center-Based child care opportunities for all of our families across the city.,126,,
662,0.97,5412.206,5441.035,"In the spirit of creating Connectivity between our departments, I wanted to remind everyone--I am sure you already know this but our Department of education does have some reports of work they have done to identify what specific zoning changes would need to occur in order to facilitate a better built environment policy to allow Childcare infrastructure to permeate throughout our neighborhood.",126,,
663,0.97,5441.035,5460.555,I would just offer that up . My office is happy to send that to you all of you have not seen it yet and would encourage you all to take a look at that and take it into consideration and have conversations about two create shared commitments around that.,126,,
664,0.97,5460.555,5476.003,The last thing I wanted to touch on and then I will hand it back over to the chair is really around--Councilmember Strauss touched on this a little bit.,126,,
665,0.97,5476.003,5503.598,I just want to lift up those comments . I want to echo some of those comments by simply asking what Opcd thinks they need in terms of tools to be able to simplify and modernize our zoning land use urban design and review guidelines and any other related codes through the comprehensive plan or through some other mechanism.,126,,
666,0.97,5503.598,5551.946,I think that you mentioned that some of our codes and laws and systems are outdated in many ways . I suppose what I am looking for is some sense from you all about what kind of tools or resource would be necessary through our current budgeting process that would allow you all to take a very Holistic view of those outdated codes and systems to get this moving toward a more modern set of applicable codes in this area . I am thinking about the whole thing.,126,,
667,0.97,5551.946,5557.652,"Zoning, Land-Use, urban design, guidelines, anything else that I may have listed.",126,,
668,0.97,5557.652,5564.559,That is the small question.,127,,
669,0.97,5564.559,5568.596,I only like to ask small questions.,128,,
670,0.97,5568.596,5570.598,I appreciate the question.,129,,
671,0.97,5570.598,5649.51,"While I am probably not prepared to do full justice to the answer, I do believe that we can achieve social change and social justice through engagement . I think that the community--the COMP plan needs update and a robust community engagement with it at the same time we are working across departments will be the next steps to getting there . As we bring gone an indigenous planner and as we bring on a consultant for the EIS and for community engagement and for the Subarea plan, work to frame what comes next--I will be in a much better position to provide you some more concrete answers . I do hear on the regular--the conversation around permit processes, design review, those are ones that have come to me as well.",129,,
672,0.97,5649.51,5686.414,"There is a lot of work that we are going to do to take a look at the processing we have in place and how we open up some doors to provide more resources to small business, Bicop communities to navigate our processes and to do more and to do better to support generational wealth . There is a lot to leave there . I do appreciate the question.",129,,
673,0.97,5686.414,5694.922,"I think that what we've talked about in terms of the resources that we have in the proposed budget, we are very excited about.",129,,
674,0.97,5694.922,5717.745,"The additional staffing opportunities will help us build additional momentum in that whole list of areas that you just went through . I think I am going to need to get into it a little bit more to be able to come back to Council to talk about where I see more opportunities, if that makes sense.",129,,
675,0.97,5717.745,5720.748,That makes a lot of sense.,130,,
676,0.97,5720.748,5734.895,I appreciate the opportunity to continue to engage in that question about how our outdated codes and laws have really resulted in creating a lot of unintended consequences.,130,,
677,0.97,5734.895,5742.937,Some might argue intended consequences of not actually achieving the goal of having complete neighborhoods.,130,,
678,0.97,5742.937,5765.192,"I am very interested in identifying ways that we can engage in that reform work to advance our goals around equity and making our city more sustainable as well . just a real-life example is, I know that there are $25,000 included in this budget to address code barriers to Edi, for example.",130,,
679,0.97,5765.192,5795.122,"I just wonder whether that could serve as a learning opportunity for us to see if we can bring whatever lessons learned in that narrower context . Also, recognize that it is happening at the same time we are considering modifications to the comprehensive plan . I am looking for help and guidance in figuring out how to create seniority so we don't Miss the opportunity for another decade.",130,,
680,0.97,5795.122,5799.326,I appreciate that.,131,,
681,0.97,5799.326,5826.754,I was just a Co-Chair for national research conference of architects with [Indiscernible] talking about historic routes of racism and how that affects cities in understanding the city of Seattle is not unique in this unfortunate legacy.,131,,
682,0.97,5826.754,5834.962,It will take us a very long time . I think we could have some opportunities and a new roadmap.,131,,
683,0.97,5834.962,5837.131,Thank you.,132,,
684,0.97,5837.131,5841.368,We are getting toward the end of this time.,133,,
685,0.97,5841.368,5845.472,We are little bit over.,133,,
686,0.97,5845.472,5859.453,I just want to signal my interest as well in having Opcd and SD Ci work together to start a meaningful process review of the design review process.,134,,
687,0.97,5859.453,5870.064,It does not meet our goals . I do think it is time for us to review that.,134,,
688,0.97,5870.064,5874.501,I know there are lots of folks hearing from community as well.,134,,
689,0.97,5874.501,5876.904,I am sorry.,135,,
690,0.97,5876.904,5884.211,We have a great relationship . I love the work we are doing to gather . I hear you.,135,,
691,0.97,5884.211,5887.314,We need to jump into this in 2022 as well.,135,,
692,0.97,5887.314,5895.723,Thank you.,136,,
693,0.97,5895.723,5898.192,"Councilmember Strauss, I know you had a few extra questions.",137,,
694,0.97,5898.192,5900.094,Anything burning you would like to get out right now?,137,,
695,0.97,5900.094,5900.527,Thank you.,138,,
696,0.97,5900.527,5902.529,I will hold my questions in interest of time.,138,,
697,0.97,5902.529,5908.602,We do have a close of business by today for Allie and Patty . Thank you for collecting those questions.,139,,
698,0.97,5908.602,5916.744,"Council members, I will send my questions along with Councilmember Strauss as well.",139,,
699,0.97,5916.744,5921.215,All of you have touched on all of the issues I was going to say.,139,,
700,0.97,5921.215,5938.732,"To your point about the long overdue analysis and more importantly policy changes needed in our zoning policies, it will take even longer if your comprehensive plan is not fully funded.",139,,
701,0.97,5938.732,5958.185,We have not only a legacy to uproot but we have evidence by your incredible staff through the racial equity Toolkit that we have funded that your team work directly with community partners including Puget sound to have a roadmap for how those policy changes should be implemented.,139,,
702,0.97,5958.185,5966.627,I want to thank you and your team for all of the work that you did on that racial equity Toolkit.,139,,
703,0.97,5966.627,5983.177,"I think that provides not only the strategies for how we can create a more inclusive COMP plan process, a great model, but it provides the justification for the urgency to do it now.",139,,
704,0.97,5983.177,6012.239,"This will be a big priority for us in this 2022 budget to finalize a budget that includes the funding, the breakdown that will be helpful in response to some of the questions to include what it looks like to have the full amount for community engagement including contracts with Community-Based organization to help us engage.",139,,
705,0.97,6012.239,6031.325,"When we do it right, it means as we look at single-family zoning as requested in, we don't have to do it again later and be Duplicative . I would like to see in that analysis as well with the total number of funding is needed to include the study of single zoning families in the comprehensive plan as well.",139,,
706,0.97,6031.325,6045.539,"I will be asking some Aloe up questions about the $25,000 with equitable zoning barriers that we are attempting to reduce . I am just making sure I understand the program and whether or not that is funded as well.",139,,
707,0.97,6045.539,6051.245,"With that, anything else you would like to say?",139,,
708,0.97,6051.245,6055.682,I would say a couple of things.,140,,
709,0.97,6055.682,6065.292,"One, regarding the deadline, it sounds like there are additional questions that we will get today that we need to answer by the end of the day today.",140,,
710,0.97,6065.292,6065.526,No.,141,,
711,0.97,6065.526,6069.296,That would be amazing if you could do that but we are going to send those to our team.,141,,
712,0.97,6069.296,6079.473,If an internal Councilmember--we are collecting all of the questions and you are not inundated with questions from a variety of different offices.,141,,
713,0.97,6079.473,6082.709,We will collect those and you will have a streamlined practice for each apartment.,141,,
714,0.97,6082.709,6083.777,No deadline for you all.,141,,
715,0.97,6083.777,6091.618,You all have been wonderful to get us information and we will work with you over the next two months.,141,,
716,0.97,6091.618,6092.219,Okay.,142,,
717,0.97,6092.219,6095.122,Thank you for the clarification.,142,,
718,0.97,6095.122,6098.926,I want to say--I am sorry.,142,,
719,0.97,6098.926,6104.231,I'm going to sound like a giddy school child for a second.,142,,
720,0.97,6104.231,6107.701,Super exciting to be able to present to all of you today and all of the questions.,142,,
721,0.97,6107.701,6116.844,Totally amazing and--this is--I will just speak for myself.,142,,
722,0.97,6116.844,6134.528,"This is what gets me out of bed every morning . I see and feel how the work that we do supports community . When we don't do it well, how it harms community.",142,,
723,0.97,6134.528,6137.564,I appreciate all of the things you have asked about today.,142,,
724,0.97,6137.564,6172.099,"Part of the work I have seen us doing this year--despite Covid, despite this terrible pandemic that we have had to live through, getting out into the community, meeting and talking with people about what their needs are, seeing how that relates back to the policies we are putting in place and the dollars we are funding for community led projects, I am very grateful to all of you for your support of the work and am super excited that you added us to your busy calendar to be able to talk with you today.",142,,
725,0.97,6172.099,6183.71,Just a lot of thanks . I know our staff was excited to do this as well.,142,,

735,0.97,6216.009,6219.046,Thank you very much.,146,,
736,0.97,6219.046,6237.698,"Speaking of making sure our community is inclusive, that not only includes making sure our roads are connected but that the community has the ability to walk and bike and be safe and be free from harm by automobiles and making sure everything literally runs on time.",146,,
737,0.97,6237.698,6242.169,That is why we have direct dirt Sam Zimbabwe with us from the Department of transportation.,146,,

890,0.97,7956.581,7961.586,This change underscores the need for Sdot to Realign our CIP as I just described.,154,,
891,0.97,7961.586,7972.798,"Additionally, the proposal includes $14.2 million of new local investments into the portfolio from the new $20 Dlf.",154,,
892,0.97,7972.798,7989.081,These investments are consistent with the $20 pirate is Asian process we conducted earlier this year to solicit external Stakeholder and community feedback and input as directed by the Council spending accompanying the adoption of the 2021 budget.,154,,
893,0.97,7989.081,8003.695,"This doubles down on the commitment to safety, investing an additional $11.3 million in programs such as vision zero, sidewalk safety repair, curb ramps, and traffic signal improvements.",154,,
894,0.97,8003.695,8017.509,It also directs nearly $2 million to maintaining our current bridge assets by investing into our bridge repair backlog program.,154,,
895,0.97,8017.509,8020.946,That COMPLETES my portion of the presentation and I am going to turn it back to Sam.,154,,
896,0.97,8020.946,8022.147,Thank you very much.,154,,
897,0.97,8022.147,8023.615,You can advance to the next slide.,155,,
898,0.97,8023.615,8028.453,This is the last slide and then we look forward to the discussion.,155,,
899,0.97,8028.453,8031.023,You have heard us talk about racial equity throughout.,155,,
900,0.97,8031.023,8042.067,I just wanted to highlight a couple of places--three broad areas that our budget reflects our commitment to racial equity.,155,,
901,0.97,8042.067,8046.872,The first is in our investments in our transportation assets ad programs.,155,,
902,0.97,8046.872,8054.446,"We talked a lot about the transportation equity work group and the programs that we deliver through the Seattle transit measure, through that voter approved proposition one.",155,,
903,0.97,8054.446,8067.292,There are programs and efforts throughout the Department that are committed to delivering services and using our investments to advance racial equity.,155,,
904,0.97,8067.292,8069.094,The second is in our contracting and purchasing.,155,,
905,0.97,8069.094,8078.77,"Last year, we were able to achieve a 38% participation in our consultant contracts and a 17% purchasing through the providers.",155,,
906,0.97,8078.837,8084.509,He 38% exceeded our Goa the 17% fell just short of our purchasing goals.,155,,
907,0.97,8084.509,8099.357,"When we look below those top line numbers, we know that we have a lot of work still to do in deepening the equity participation to minority owned firms in both contracting and purchasing.",155,,
908,0.97,8099.357,8112.704,The third is in advancing our work internally and building a diverse and inclusive workplace . We made a lot of strides in the last year but still have a lot of work to do.,155,,
909,0.97,8112.704,8142.767,"We stood up equal opportunity program as required for transit agency of our size . We have deepened our work with our change team and our employee resource groups, our Race-Based Divinity groups around training, participation in budget of element process and in working to make Sdot an inclusive and diverse workplace but there is still a lot to do.",155,,
910,0.97,8142.767,8146.872,Those initiatives remain baked into our budget as a whole.,155,,
911,0.97,8146.872,8148.507,We have talked for quite a long time.,155,,
912,0.97,8148.507,8158.049,We will be quiet here and turn it back to you for questions and discussions.,155,,
913,0.97,8158.049,8158.884,Thank you very much.,156,,
914,0.97,8158.884,8164.389,I appreciate the in-depth presentation and we will turn it over to Councilmember Pedersen for questions.,156,,
915,0.97,8164.389,8165.991,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,157,,
916,0.97,8165.991,8176.501,"Thank you, director Zimbabwe.",157,,
917,0.97,8178.637,8196.621,You have dealt with a lot . as well as the successful renewal of our transportation benefit district to support transit at all Council members worked on.,157,,
918,0.97,8196.621,8198.29,I deeply appreciate the Sdot workers in the field.,157,,
919,0.97,8198.29,8200.025,They have been busy on multiple transportation projects.,157,,
920,0.97,8200.025,8203.762,It was nice to talk with the bridges and structures team on the West Seattle bridge this week.,157,,
921,0.97,8203.762,8207.032,It is great to hear that that is on time for restoration of that bridge.,157,,
922,0.97,8207.032,8223.048,I appreciate the focus in the budget on vision zero safety investments and the need to integrate various plans for each mode of transportation.,157,,
923,0.97,8223.048,8225.784,I know we are all excited about the opening of the three Light- rail station's.,157,,
924,0.97,8225.784,8229.454,Sdot is working with King County Metro to connect transit riders to these long-awaited generational investments.,157,,
925,0.97,8229.454,8236.061,I do want to comment on some issues I see with the budget right now.,157,,
926,0.97,8236.061,8281.673,"I know other Councilmembers will have questions and comments . I am seeing, once again, a budget proposal that severely under funds big infrastructure needs . As we emerge from Covid and try to Kickstart our economy, I believe our city and region would be in much better shape if we avoid another year of Underfunding . bridges connect our communities and our region . We are reminded by the closure of the West Seattle bridge and the subsequent city auditor report on bridges that bridges impact mobility of everyone, including transit riders getting two jobs, truck drivers delivering food.",157,,
927,0.97,8281.673,8291.516,The budget misses an opportunity to provide local matching dollars that will be needed to leverage Federal dollars from either a congressional infrastructure bill that is adopted or if both are adopted.,157,,
928,0.97,8291.516,8307.532,"Based on my read of this budget proposal, I am seeing only $1.5 million more in 2022 for bridge maintenance.",157,,
929,0.97,8310.669,8318.743,I know our central staff will be digging into that to see how much is truly additive toward that.,157,,
930,0.97,8318.743,8331.723,"I really appreciate you providing and crafting your list of potential future bridge infrastructure projects, getting that to us on time.",157,,
931,0.97,8331.723,8338.63,"Unfortunately, the executive does not seem to have fully funded those.",157,,
932,0.97,8338.63,8342.267,You have a list of projects with a potential cost but not actually providing funds to do that.,157,,
933,0.97,8342.267,8348.606,That would then shift over to the idea that some of us floated previously.,157,,
934,0.97,8348.606,8350.308,Interest rates are at historic lows.,157,,
935,0.97,8350.308,8351.643,Construction workers are ready for more jobs.,157,,
936,0.97,8351.643,8358.616,The best way to maximize Seattle from receiving funds is to be ready with local matching dollars.,157,,
937,0.97,8358.616,8369.894,"That gets us back to the idea of issuing bonds to fund these Upfront . When we debated this last time, we were trying to Divvy up $7 million.",157,,
938,0.97,8369.894,8375.433,I think that constrained our options but now we are looking at your entire $700 million budget.,157,,
939,0.97,8375.433,8393.485,I am hoping we can go big and make up for lost ground . One idea is to consider a modest increase to the commercial parking tax . This is going to be a Yes and situation.,157,,
940,0.97,8393.485,8397.922,I know a lot of us like the way you have allocated that vehicle license fee dollars.,157,,
941,0.97,8397.922,8410.335,Those things can be funded and we can do more for bridges if we issue bonds . I look forward to working with my colleagues on that so we can avoid kicking the can down the road or missing this moment.,157,,
942,0.97,8410.335,8421.146,"Regarding the center city Connector, I do want to reiterate concerns I have about that project . I don't support that project.",157,,
943,0.97,8421.146,8430.255,I feel that it is redundant considering the light rail lines and bus lines run along the same path.,157,,
944,0.97,8430.255,8434.359,I think there are better ways we can invest that $2.4 million.,157,,
945,0.97,8434.359,8455.447,"Then, the money the project would cost later could be invested in other climate adaptation projects or vision zero safety projects . that resolution that was mentioned, 31914, transportation and transit projects including and not limited to.",157,,
946,0.97,8455.447,8457.882,There was a lot of flexibility in how we use that funding.,157,,
947,0.97,8457.882,8460.385,Those are my opening remarks about the transportation package.,157,,
948,0.97,8460.385,8465.59,Happy to hear any response to that.,157,,
949,0.97,8465.59,8468.793,I know Councilmembers will have other questions for you.,157,,
950,0.97,8468.793,8469.46,Thank you.,157,,
951,0.97,8469.46,8477.368,Maybe I will respond in interest of time to the local leverage question in Federal grants.,158,,
952,0.97,8477.368,8484.876,I know that is an ongoing question.,158,,
953,0.97,8484.876,8498.089,It remains to be seen what will happen with the Federal infrastructure bill . We will see where it goes.,158,,
954,0.97,8498.089,8507.899,"It is unlikely that there will be some resources allocated in the normal process to States, some through the regions to Prc and some discretionary.",158,,
955,0.97,8507.899,8512.103,The timing of when those resources become available to us and how we can apply them to projects is uncertain.,158,,
956,0.97,8512.103,8543.968,I have been hopeful in the last nine months in ways that I was not for four years before that about how we are able to access those funds . We have gotten over $130 million in Federal grants this year we have always matched those resources.,158,,
957,0.97,8543.968,8549.474,We have looked at where those projects were from a readiness perspective and be able to take down those resources from the Federal Government when they are available.,158,,
958,0.97,8549.474,8558.016,I have no doubt that we will be able to do that . It is a little bit premature from my perspective to set aside local dollars before we know more about what is happening.,158,,
959,0.97,8558.016,8574.465,"Rest assured that when those Federal resources become available, we have done it this year and we will be able to do that . I have strong confidence in our ability as a city to access those investments.",158,,
960,0.97,8574.465,8575.934,Thank you very much.,159,,
961,0.97,8575.934,8587.412,"Councilmember Pedersen, did you have any additional questions or comments this morning?",159,,
962,0.97,8587.412,8588.279,Not at this time.,160,,
963,0.97,8588.279,8589.113,Maybe at the end.,160,,
964,0.97,8589.113,8589.48,Thank you.,160,,
965,0.97,8589.48,8590.515,Thank you very much.,161,,
966,0.97,8590.515,8596.788,I have Councilmember Morales and then Councilmember Lewis and I will put myself in the Queue too.,161,,
967,0.97,8596.788,8599.223,We have about 20 more minutes for this conversation.,161,,
968,0.97,8599.223,8607.332,"Colleagues, please keep your remarks to a minimum and focus on the questions so we can get to the final presentation this morning as well.",161,,
969,0.97,8607.332,8608.433,Thank you so much.,161,,
970,0.97,8608.433,8610.001,Good morning.,162,,
971,0.97,8610.001,8619.143,Thank you for being here . I have a few questions and I will tell you now that they are all about pedestrians.,162,,
972,0.97,8619.143,8642.734,"I am interested to know, looking at the cost of effective's, it looks like the estimated cost to build one block of a sidewalk is $400,000 . that limits our ability to do it the way we would like.",162,,
973,0.97,8642.734,8651.242,"I am interested in learning a little bit about what goes into that cost, why it is so expensive?",162,,
974,0.97,8651.242,8671.095,"As you know, there are parts of the city South end where there are no sidewalks . We are looking at how we can begin to address that but having a basic understanding of cost for the sidewalk would be helpful.",162,,
975,0.97,8671.095,8672.163,Sure.,163,,
976,0.97,8672.163,8677.402,I can talk a little bit about that and we can follow up a little bit more.,163,,
977,0.97,8677.402,8699.457,A lot of the costs that goes into our communities--those that don't have sidewalks often don't have drainage and infrastructure that is necessary to make a sidewalk work . a lot of what goes into our traditional sidewalks is when we do those changes to build a sidewalk.,163,,
978,0.97,8699.457,8706.297,We also impact drainage of the Right-Of-Way and have to install curb and gutter and some of the drainage Infrastructures that goes into it.,163,,
979,0.97,8706.297,8714.639,That is often the biggest single cost that goes into the increment of cost.,163,,
980,0.97,8714.639,8719.644,We continue to do that on our priority pedestrian network and look for those opportunities.,163,,
981,0.97,8719.644,8731.622,Some of our projects also take a little more effort because we are working with adjacent property owners and dealing with driveways and other access issues.,163,,
982,0.97,8731.622,8738.963,That takes more design and effort in terms of easement or temporary construction access acquisition.,163,,
983,0.97,8738.963,8740.064,Thank you for that.,164,,
984,0.97,8740.064,8749.74,I am interested in learning more about the home zone . I know we have a pilot implementation.,164,,
985,0.97,8749.74,8751.576,There were several neighborhoods in district 2 that were interested.,164,,
986,0.97,8751.576,8758.282,I know there are conversations about--you know where I am going.,164,,
987,0.97,8758.282,8768.659,We are trying to look for alternatives if building sidewalks is prohibitive . What are some other options that we have for increasing safety?,164,,
988,0.97,8768.659,8775.6,I am asking because we've got a lot of young kids walking and Biking to school.,164,,
989,0.97,8775.6,8776.167,We have Elders.,164,,
990,0.97,8776.167,8796.487,"We have folks with mobility issues who are trying to get around their neighborhoods safely . in areas like North and South Seattle where the sidewalks don't exist, I feel a sense of urgency for figuring out some solution and really starting to move toward something.",164,,
991,0.97,8796.487,8800.892,I look forward to talking with you more about that.,164,,
992,0.97,8800.892,8810.101,Especially--can you talk a little bit about the home zones and how we use support implementation of that?,164,,
993,0.97,8810.101,8810.501,Yeah.,165,,
994,0.97,8810.501,8817.742,That is a great question.,165,,
995,0.97,8817.742,8823.748,The homes zone program has been something we have tried.,165,,
996,0.97,8823.748,8846.437,"Rather than doing traffic combing on a block by block level where we often put a speed Hump here in the next Street starts to see a diversion of traffic and you are chasing after speed Humps, looking at a Communitywide approach, engaging about how people use the streets where destinations are and then working to do a comprehensive traffic calming solution at a neighborhood scale.",165,,
997,0.97,8846.437,8863.487,We have done a couple of rapid implementation efforts as part of the Reconnect West Seattle program through the West Seattle bridge closure and we have had some engagements with the communities that are bearing fruit now.,165,,
998,0.97,8863.487,8870.962,It is exciting to be able to do that on a community basis and then think about how we can Replicate that and scale it up to reach more communities across the city.,165,,
999,0.97,8870.962,8878.369,"In the end, it ends up helping us make communities successful without Duplicating resources.",165,,
1000,0.97,8878.369,8882.206,We connect people to where they need to go of all ages and abilities.,165,,
1001,0.97,8882.206,8889.513,I look forward to that Rollout and to seeing what we can scale up to get that done.,166,,
1002,0.97,8889.513,8896.821,The last two things I want to learn about is proposed funding for safe routes to school is $2.75 million.,166,,
1003,0.97,8896.821,8922.413,That seems low . I would be interested to hear what--where that is housed in the budget with the zero goal and--2021 is on track to be the deadliest year of people killed by cars in the city.,166,,
1004,0.97,8922.413,8935.626,I would be interested to hear what your vision zero team believes are the biggest needs to do their work and what the proposed vision zero budget would include if we are talking about capital.,166,,
1005,0.97,8935.626,8944.769,What would it take to start to achieve those goals so we can eliminate pedestrian fatalities?,166,,
1006,0.97,8944.769,8948.439,This is always a little bit of a challenge when we talk about our budget.,167,,
1007,0.97,8948.439,8976.6,Efforts get baked into the whole of the capital budget and our operating budget too . Some of the increment around vision zero are when we go to highest crash locations--we have scaled up some of our citywide implementation of pedestrian first signals where pedestrians get a head start before cars start to drive . that helps cut down turning crashes.,167,,
1008,0.97,8976.6,8991.282,We also reduce speed limits across the city over the course of 2020 and into the beginning part of this year and will be evaluating that to see where that has been effective and what other steps are needed.,167,,
1009,0.97,8991.282,9000.257,"With the vision zero program, we often do small pilot efforts that then, when they look like they are bearing fruit, we can scale up and do more of a citywide level.",167,,
1010,0.97,9000.257,9008.132,A lot of those efforts are baked into our capital projects overall.,167,,
1011,0.97,9008.132,9013.004,"I would also say on safe routes to school, somewhat similar.",167,,
1012,0.97,9013.004,9017.641,"When our projects are connecting to schools, we are doing some of those things separately.",167,,
1013,0.97,9017.641,9024.148,We are only focused on the access to school when it is a Standalone is a program like that.,167,,
1014,0.97,9024.148,9031.722,We can provide a little bit more detail on the specific projects that are funded in 2022.,167,,
1015,0.97,9031.722,9040.231,I feel frustrated and I feel like lots of community members feel frustrated.,168,,
1016,0.97,9040.231,9064.789,"What seems to be a very obvious safety solution, a painted crosswalk, flashing signal, something very often requires a whole community process and applying for a neighborhood matching fund . There is a lot of barriers for some community members to get what they feel like is basic safety that the city should be providing.",168,,
1017,0.97,9064.789,9065.79,"I have to say, I agree.",168,,
1018,0.97,9065.79,9075.166,We should not be asking our community members to engage and organize to apply for a grant to get a sidewalk or a crosswalk that we should be providing.,168,,
1019,0.97,9075.166,9077.001,That is a safety issue.,168,,
1020,0.97,9077.001,9092.683,I know that is a resource question but I am interested in working with you to figure out how we start to move in a direction that just assumes that the city will provide the kind of pedestrian safety improvements that our neighbors deserve.,168,,
1021,0.97,9092.683,9094.418,I will leave it at that.,168,,
1022,0.97,9094.418,9099.723,"Thank you Councilmember, Morales.",169,,
1023,0.97,9099.723,9102.793,We have Councilmember Lewis.,169,,
1024,0.97,9102.793,9106.63,"Councilmember Herbold, I see you as well.",169,,
1025,0.97,9106.63,9107.631,Thank you so much.,170,,
1026,0.97,9107.631,9114.138,My questions are in a similar vein to Councilmember Morales.,170,,
1027,0.97,9114.138,9123.113,People ask me all the time what I am surprised about from serving on the city council.,170,,
1028,0.97,9123.113,9127.151,There has been a lot of things but it has been an unconventional year and a half.,170,,
1029,0.97,9127.151,9135.259,One of the things that comes up a lot in my district as Councilmember Morales just stated is huge demand for traffic calling.,170,,
1030,0.97,9135.259,9141.832,A huge man for protected bike lanes.,170,,
1031,0.97,9141.832,9144.034,I knew that it was out there but I had been surprised.,170,,
1032,0.97,9144.034,9162.086,"Similar to Councilmember Morales, huge pent-up frustration of people who have been organizing for years to try to get some kind of basic public safety improvement and feel like they can't get through all of the bureaucracy.",170,,
1033,0.97,9162.086,9168.192,"I will say, director Zimbabwe, the team at Sdot has been very helpful in talking about these projects and Queuing them up.",170,,
1034,0.97,9168.192,9169.994,It has been a Covid era resource issue.,170,,
1035,0.97,9169.994,9175.499,I want to give a shout out to bill who has been responsive and helpful in flagging things and validating the merit of a lot of these requests.,170,,
1036,0.97,9175.499,9179.97,The concern over resources remain.,170,,
1037,0.97,9179.97,9184.875,I am going to put my cards on the table a little bit here.,170,,
1038,0.97,9184.875,9212.236,"Since this has been a big interest for my office and a lot of my colleagues here--I have been talking to central staff over the last few months, exploring the possibility of a 1% increase in the commercial parking tax which would raise $3.2 million a year and really dedicating that as a dedicated resource to realizing a lot of our vision zero goals.",170,,
1039,0.97,9212.236,9230.354,"A lot of our traffic calming projects, protected bike lanes, things that are going to make it real, sustained investment with an investment Year-Over- year to keep driving toward our goal of vision zero by 2030.",170,,
1040,0.97,9230.354,9231.555,Calvin did a really good job.,170,,
1041,0.97,9231.555,9240.998,I am happy to have Calvin chow on our central staff deliver this memo to all Council offices.,170,,
1042,0.97,9240.998,9252.276,I have been including chair Pedersen since this is his policy area throughout my expiration of this process and I am happy to have it distributed now that we are in budget.,170,,
1043,0.97,9252.276,9283.374,"The question here, director Zimbabwe, would be, if we have that $3.2 million resource, what would be the best way for the Council to allocate it as a dedicated source of funding to really confront our vision zero goals and really empower you and your Department to start putting money into these projects in a really sustained way to drive that kind of a vision.",170,,
1044,0.97,9283.374,9287.211,"Thank you, Councilmember.",171,,
1045,0.97,9287.211,9293.317,Let me say a couple of things.,171,,
1046,0.97,9293.317,9295.819,I recognize we have had capacity constraints.,171,,
1047,0.97,9295.819,9300.024,We did not do a lot of things in 2020.,171,,
1048,0.97,9300.024,9327.851,"That was partly as a result of our working really hard to keep our employees safe . The second is, I think what you are talking about with ongoing resources that serve some of these programmatic goals Aligns well with the $20 vehicle license fee that Council adopted last year.",171,,
1049,0.97,9327.851,9343.467,"When we developed the spend plan and that is what is in the proposed budget, we took those through the budget and allocated that in an ongoing way that helps us go against it.",171,,
1050,0.97,9343.467,9346.336,That can start to make a big difference.,171,,
1051,0.97,9346.336,9375.999,"I would look to that process to look in the veins of where we have already done some of that community engagement around some of our needs and equity asset maintenance, safety, and our climate investments and really look to that spend plan process as additional resources become available.",171,,
1052,0.97,9375.999,9382.706,We thought of that as a thing that can be consistent and something that can be scaled over time to hit those programs that will make a big difference.,171,,
1053,0.97,9382.706,9407.731,"For us, having those ongoing revenue streams to meet some of those things we have struggled to do in the past really helped us to think about how we staff it, how we build a pipeline, how we engage with communities and a reliable way rather than only looking at episodic one off capital projects that can take a bit longer, especially if we are trying to leverage other resources as well.",171,,
1054,0.97,9407.731,9409.733,Some of our ongoing programs leverage resources.,171,,
1055,0.97,9409.733,9430.587,"We got some state resources over the course of this year are some additional pedestrian median Islands . If we had not been taking about how to do those safe crossings, we would not have been able to access some of the state resources as well.",171,,
1056,0.97,9430.587,9434.391,Can I get a quick clarification there? I appreciate the answer.,172,,
1057,0.97,9434.391,9446.17,"I just want to be clear, you are saying if there more war resources, the Council would guide us toward distributing them in accordance to that outreach process?",172,,
1058,0.97,9446.17,9457.848,You are not implying that you have plenty of resource already through that . You guys would have capacity to take on more investment in those areas if we were to provide them?,172,,
1059,0.97,9457.848,9465.155,$3.2 million--we would have to look at how to deliver on that.,173,,
1060,0.97,9465.155,9484.475,"For us, sometimes even these ongoing resources, the Vlf last year that passed, we had six months to prepare for six months of delivery . Some of the places where you are seeing some position ads in our proposed budget, these resources do require additional people.",173,,
1061,0.97,9484.475,9486.143,We have addressed some of that.,173,,
1062,0.97,9486.143,9498.889,"It drew temporary work and temporary assignments . As we said this year, those become permanent ongoing if there are the resources to support them.",173,,
1063,0.97,9498.889,9504.995,A lot of those additional staff resources will be necessary to deliver the smaller projects.,173,,
1064,0.97,9504.995,9514.738,That sometimes creates opportunities for small contracting services.,173,,
1065,0.97,9514.738,9517.741,Do I know exactly how we would deliver the additional now?,173,,
1066,0.97,9517.741,9527.117,No but that is a resource that we could figure out what would be needed to successfully deliver that as well.,173,,
1067,0.97,9527.117,9542.065,"I am mostly saying that if there are incremental resources, allocating those into the programs as we have started to outline in the budget will help us collaborate and deliver those programs as quickly as possible.",173,,
1068,0.97,9542.065,9546.169,Great . We will certainly be in touch.,174,,
1069,0.97,9546.169,9553.277,I have some other questions but I will submit those in writing considering the time.,174,,
1070,0.97,9553.277,9563.353,I will close out here and say I appreciate chair Pedersen's comments about pursuing the commercial parking tax as a resource.,174,,
1071,0.97,9563.353,9567.291,We have not raised that tax in a decade.,174,,
1072,0.97,9567.291,9584.608,A small increase that is marginal probably would not have significant impacts on businesses . definitely going to reach out to Councilmember Morales in this area.,174,,
1073,0.97,9584.608,9594.718,The three of us can get together on some kind of green sheet proposal here to lean into these investments that we have flagged as being critical and important.,174,,
1074,0.97,9594.718,9596.987,Thank you very much.,174,,
1075,0.97,9596.987,9601.224,Thank you very much for holding the rest of your questions.,175,,
1076,0.97,9601.224,9608.999,We are going to be dropping the sheets this year.,175,,
1077,0.97,9608.999,9614.438,It will be very exciting and straightforward.,175,,
1078,0.97,9614.438,9621.745,I look forward to seeing more on that possible shared amendment . We will have issue identification.,175,,
1079,0.97,9621.745,9625.649,It gives us a chance to talk more about the why . keep your comments short.,175,,
1080,0.97,9625.649,9627.684,We have 10 more minutes for this section.,175,,
1081,0.97,9627.684,9632.322,Myself and Councilmember Herbold are in the Queue here.,175,,
1082,0.97,9632.322,9635.192,I'm going to ask a very short question on slight two if we can.,175,,
1083,0.97,9635.192,9637.16,We are looking at parking enforcement officers.,175,,
1084,0.97,9637.16,9647.571,"For me, are all of the costs related to personnel or are these costs including --",175,,
1085,0.97,9647.571,9652.042,"Council member Herbold, you are off mute.",176,,
1086,0.97,9652.042,9657.314,"Patty, if you don't mind Teeing up slide number two, thank you very much.",176,,
1087,0.97,9657.314,9658.382,"Go ahead, director.",176,,
1088,0.97,9658.382,9660.784,I missed the last part of that.,177,,
1089,0.97,9660.784,9665.856,Can you repeat that?,177,,
1090,0.97,9665.856,9676.199,"When we are looking at the cost of parking enforcement officers, I am wondering if all of these costs are related to personnel or is this also including the one time cost for transferring personnel over?",178,,
1091,0.97,9676.199,9678.668,Transferring over responsibilities.,179,,
1092,0.97,9678.668,9680.003,Is it all personnel?,179,,
1093,0.97,9680.003,9683.774,And I jump in on this?,180,,
1094,0.97,9683.774,9685.776,"Go ahead, Kris.",181,,
1095,0.97,9685.776,9688.378,I can take my reading glasses off now.,182,,
1096,0.97,9688.378,9707.698,"The cost related to the 120 in terms of labor, benefits, that is included in that lump sum.",182,,
1097,0.97,9707.698,9730.353,"There is still some work to do to figure out the support needs for training, for example and how the program fits in and Nestles in and repeats support services from Sdot such as the costs associated with Enterprisewide support services.",182,,
1098,0.97,9730.353,9736.86,All of the salary and benefits and such are included.,182,,
1099,0.97,9736.86,9739.93,Does that answer your question?,182,,
1100,0.97,9739.93,9743.867,Yeah . everything is included.,183,,
1101,0.97,9743.867,9749.339,Okay.,183,,
1102,0.97,9749.339,9760.717,"Related to the integrated transportation plan, I am glad to see the planning for the B renewal beginning.",183,,
1103,0.97,9760.717,9761.284,This is really exciting.,183,,

1106,0.97,9767.991,9770.827,I want to make sure we have etiquette resources for our early outreach.,183,,
1107,0.97,9770.827,9779.603,How do resources compare from the previous move Seattle levy to this one around equitable community engagement?,183,,
1108,0.97,9779.603,9784.875,Do you feel like we are increasing community engagement or the initial conversations on move Seattle?,183,,
1109,0.97,9784.875,9787.511,Absolutely.,184,,
1110,0.97,9787.511,9793.617,I think that is part of why you see such a large number here.,184,,
1111,0.97,9793.617,9818.408,It is not only targeted around the renewal of a funding measure but about the engagement early at the planning process . We bring forward a funding measure that deepens our commitment to equity and climate and safety and asset stewardship along with bringing it along with community.,184,,
1112,0.97,9818.408,9841.965,Reaching communities meaningfully is really challenging and I listen to that Convrsation with the director about that plan . We are working to align these efforts that were not out there in multiple places.,184,,
1113,0.97,9841.965,9857.981,This is also the rollup of modal planning as it has traditionally been done in the city to put resources into integrating those modal plans.,184,,
1114,0.97,9857.981,9867.691,There is technical assessment and resources that are needed to inform that and be informed by that community process as well.,184,,
1115,0.97,9867.691,9870.393,"As Kris said, we are bringing a consultant team on board.",184,,
1116,0.97,9870.393,9878.768,"This is our best estimate right now, sort of the resources that we see in the near term.",184,,
1117,0.97,9878.768,9890.113,"As we begin to scope the work in more detail and look toward launching this work in 2022, that will be ongoing with how we work with community.",184,,
1118,0.97,9890.113,9907.931,We have also worked with community liaisons to help us do some of that early Scoping and figure out what it will mean to do the integrated transportation plan that serves as the baseline for a real robust funding discussion.,184,,
1119,0.97,9907.931,9921.745,I think we can tell that we want to make sure the departments have full funding with equitable community engagement.,185,,
1120,0.97,9921.745,9928.318,It will cost us more money and more time in the Backend.,185,,
1121,0.97,9928.318,9932.956,Thank you for letting us know you feel like it is fully funded.,185,,
1122,0.97,9932.956,9936.826,"If something comes up, we would love to have that flag.",185,,
1123,0.97,9936.826,9938.662,I will turn it over to Councilmember Herbold.,185,,
1124,0.97,9938.662,9957.747,"On slide seven, talk about remediation . I think we will talk more the next presentation with parks . There is an overall question about where the best Department is to respond to remediation.",185,,
1125,0.97,9957.747,9964.854,"Just double checking, is the amount for remediation on slide seven for a calendar year or is that also ending in August?",185,,
1126,0.97,9964.854,9967.19,I will take this one.,186,,
1127,0.97,9967.19,9989.612,The amount related to Rv remediation is an ongoing amount that is support to Seattle public utilities and their work . Sdot is providing financial support to the activities on an ongoing basis beginning in 2021.,186,,
1128,0.97,9989.612,9997.721,You see it as a negative number because it is a transfer from our existing resource base over to Spu.,186,,
1129,0.97,9997.721,10000.19,I get that.,187,,
1130,0.97,10000.19,10007.731,"Overall, we will be concerned about any cleanup ending in August but we will talk more about that.",187,,
1131,0.97,10007.731,10009.966,Thank you for the occasion on the slide.,187,,

1134,0.97,10013.336,10024.748,My easiest question--I will get in trouble if I don't ask this question.,188,,
1135,0.97,10024.748,10033.99,I just want to confirm that the West Seattle bridge remains on schedule for mid 2022 completion of the repair and opening up the bridge to traffic.,188,,
1136,0.97,10033.99,10035.058,Yes.,189,,
1137,0.97,10035.058,10035.558,Thank you.,190,,
1138,0.97,10035.558,10060.55,"On the topic of bridges, I want to thank Sdot for complying with the requests that the Council made in ordinance 12 6327 in sending over a list of projects that could be funded by a $100 million funding in 2022 including $75 million of bridge maintenance and other projects.",190,,

1142,0.97,10078.401,10085.909,Will these positions facilitate faster action on the city side of the projects?,190,,
1143,0.97,10085.909,10107.831,There are two existing positions that are wholly funded in the sound transit programs but we do Fund and have resources Departmentwide and citywide that are looking to accelerate and advance the program.,191,,
1144,0.97,10107.831,10108.698,Some of those are Reimbursable.,191,,
1145,0.97,10108.698,10130.153,"Some of the work directly related to permitting and some of the work with sound transit would eventually be Reimbursable . Some of that is around the city's work, preparing for engaging in the environmental process but also preparing for stationary planning and other activities.",191,,
1146,0.97,10130.153,10133.656,There are only a few people who are 100% dedicated but there are others who are out there.,191,,
1147,0.97,10133.656,10152.375,We had close to 200 reviewers on an administrative draft of the environmental impact statement and expect to have the same number of technical efforts across the city working on review of the draft environmental impact statement.,191,,

1150,0.97,10168.992,10175.899,Sidewalk repair is another one of those issues that is important to pedestrian safety.,192,,
1151,0.97,10175.899,10181.604,There were a series of recommendations . Our report was in June 2020.,192,,
1152,0.97,10181.604,10222.445,"I fully understand that this fits in the category of things while handling Covid and the failure of the West Seattle bridge we have not gotten to but I am wondering whether or not this budget includes funding for any of the recommendations, particularly--what hopefully is low hanging fruit, maybe starting with the five-year plan to carry out the temporary fixes on a plan rotating a Five- year grid across the city's entire sidewalk network.",192,,
1153,0.97,10222.445,10223.346,Yeah.,193,,
1154,0.97,10223.346,10224.447,It does.,193,,
1155,0.97,10224.447,10232.855,The answer to that is yes . Some of those vehicle license fee resources that we mentioned are going toward sidewalk safety repair.,193,,
1156,0.97,10232.855,10259.816,"We have also continue to work with our existing resources to get to that Proactive five-year Chemin bevel approach . There is also an audit that the city auditor has ongoing that was requested last year around this . as that comes, we are happy to engage on some of those other policy related items as well.",193,,
1157,0.97,10259.816,10263.753,Great . I might send a couple of other questions about some of these other recommendations.,194,,

1207,0.97,10583.806,10588.21,"As we jump into this, we will go to the first slide.",205,,
1208,0.97,10588.21,10589.946,It is obviously the budget summary.,205,,
1209,0.97,10589.946,10594.116,Our 2022 proposed budget focuses on three things.,205,,
1210,0.97,10594.116,10626.215,"Economic recovery including the restoration of pandemic that were adopted that impacted our park Fund, our general Fund and our real estate Fund . This proposed budget Realigns resources to support our commitment to equity, addresses rising costs due to inflation in this ongoing bidding climate we have but it also increases our investments in parks and public spaces for all community members.",205,,
1211,0.97,10626.215,10641.764,"Our 2021 adopted budget includes about $98 million in Federal funding and $130 million in other resources which are comprised of several funds . The park district funding, as I mentioned.",205,,
1212,0.97,10641.764,10646.769,This includes King County B funding and some other smaller capital funds.,205,,
1213,0.97,10646.769,10675.698,"In our 2020 adopted budget, we have 939 full-time staff . in terms of our revised 2021, it reflects $3.1 million change in which the funding was added this year from the clean cities initiative . Also, it shows $182 million increase with other appropriations from the 2021 adopted budget.",205,,
1214,0.97,10675.698,10694.283,"This includes $162 million in capital carryover which includes projects that are already under construction, some projects that are being held like the freeway park word, green Lake small craft center, volunteer park . There was a lot of funding there that is already committed.",205,,
1215,0.97,10694.283,10706.429,This includes $30 million for Covid-19 package as part of the American rescue plan and an $18 million for the two supplemental changes that were submitted to Council.,205,,
1216,0.97,10706.429,10717.206,"As you will see, we made some technical corrections to our 2021 budget to align the budget with our expense.",205,,
1217,0.97,10717.206,10724.747,There is a little bit of a--it does not show up in terms of the difference but there is a little bit of a gap in the St ease.,205,,
1218,0.97,10724.747,10729.018,It just reflects a technical adjustment to capture the data.,205,,
1219,0.97,10729.018,10741.363,"In terms of our 2022 proposed budget, if we compare 2022 general funds to 2021 adopted funds, we will go through these in detail in the accompanying slides.",205,,
1220,0.97,10741.363,10751.941,We have an $11 million increase in resources as compared to the 2021 adopted budget.,205,,
1221,0.97,10751.941,10757.179,The bulk of it is the restoration of General funds.,205,,
1222,0.97,10757.179,10776.699,In comparing 22 two other this in details but this rough includes a $43 million increas in other funding compared to 2021.,205,,
1223,0.97,10776.699,10783.706,"Of that, there is a $40 million investment which includes other items.",205,,
1224,0.97,10783.706,10799.688,"Then, our Std with an decrease--we will explain the proposal there . Finally, comparing on this slide the 22 proposed to the 21 revised.",205,,
1225,0.97,10799.688,10824.246,There is a difference in general fund appropriation of $8.3 million with netting out $3.1 million from the clean city Fund and a reduction in other appropriations SETS out the $183 million one time capital plus $43 million . We will go into detail.,205,,
1226,0.97,10824.246,10827.716,"Next slide, please.",205,,
1227,0.97,10827.716,10840.729,"As I mentioned, in 2021, our general budget was reduced by $11.4 million due to pandemic related revenue losses.",206,,
1228,0.97,10840.729,10852.274,"This reduction was partially offset by realigning $7.7 million at the time from park district funding from our capital budget, moving that over to our operating budget.",206,,
1229,0.97,10852.274,10866.488,"The remaining balance of $3.7 million to get to that overall reduction was done with internal ongoing reductions, cost leadings that were done within the Department.",206,,
1230,0.97,10866.488,10878.701,Our 22 budget increases the general fund by that $7.7 million which then includes the corresponding changes throughout the park district for the operating budget.,206,,
1231,0.97,10878.701,10893.916,"Also, on the capital side, the baseline $7.7 million of park district resources took over those reductions that were impacted last year.",206,,
1232,0.97,10893.916,10901.023,"They include bringing back the allocation for Parkland acquisition funds, for major project challenge funds and the backlog.",206,,
1233,0.97,10901.023,10906.729,The proposed budget then takes 5.4 million of those dollars and allocates them differently.,206,,
1234,0.97,10906.729,10911.0,"Next slide, please.",206,,
1235,0.97,10911.0,10943.666,Our proposed budget realigned $5.4 million of the capital funding to support equity goals and the costs described on this slide . This investment allows SPR to increase our human and sources support . It gets us to 16 total on our staff.,207,,
1236,0.97,10943.666,10956.879,"This is supported by $700,000 in our realignment to the acquisition funding that came back.",207,,
1237,0.97,10956.879,10964.787,"Specifically, a workforce equity advisor really has been--needs to be filled with Antiracist Deliverables.",208,,
1238,0.97,10964.787,10981.403,"It has a business maintenance division which is our largest division . It increases capacity for performance reporting, dealing with leave of absences and other managerial needs to support a large staff.",208,,
1239,0.97,10981.403,10993.482,It Reclassifies four existing positions to Reline with jobs and responsibilities.,208,,
1240,0.97,10993.482,10997.92,"In terms of line 3, the second component of our proposed equity investment includes additional support for our Pathway to equity work.",208,,
1241,0.97,10997.92,11012.368,This is our commitment to the initiative and it calls on us to challenge barriers . Our Department recognizes there is much work to do in working to position ourselves as a learning organization.,208,,
1242,0.97,11012.368,11018.64,Thiswork requires additional and dedicated resources.,208,,
1243,0.97,11018.64,11029.251,This investment will allow us at SPR to expand our equity team by adding three new equity focused positions to our focus Departmentwide.,208,,
1244,0.97,11029.251,11059.081,"One will be focused on the environment line of business along with establishing a budget for our changed team to support their ongoing work . The proposed funding for this change is $600,000 . It also includes $300,000 from the Mpd acquisition budget that was shown on the slide earlier and matched by $300,000 of reallocation of our baseline operating costs.",208,,
1245,0.97,11059.081,11081.003,"In terms of item 4, the budget also Relocates $300,000 from the challenge fund to begin Transitioning to a new program which was recommended and included parts of the oversight committee members to make this grant program more effective.",208,,
1246,0.97,11081.003,11091.313,This investment will focus on Partnering with community groups and making improvements to parks and Rec facilities.,208,,
1247,0.97,11091.313,11136.458,"This adds two positions . As I mentioned at the beginning, this budget also includes the first funding cycle that ended in 2020 . These last couple of years, including 2022 our bridge years . When we begin the next funding cycle--in those years we use resources including appropriations of interest earnings, fund balance and delaying the loan to cover cost increases for those two years including things like utilities.",208,,
1248,0.97,11136.458,11157.179,These strategies will not be sustainable what we implement the property tax collection at the 2.5 inflationary cap . The 22 proposed budget includes ongoing redirection of Mpd resources to cover the inflationary increases.,208,,
1249,0.97,11157.179,11160.249,That goes beyond the 2.5.,208,,
1250,0.97,11160.249,11170.993,It include space costs that have compounded over time like utility increases and anticipated wage increases which will be dependent on the results of the labor negotiation.,208,,
1251,0.97,11170.993,11176.598,You only see a net change of $1 million for what is covered by major maintenance funding.,208,,
1252,0.97,11176.598,11185.007,The remaining $3.1 million covers operating costs included in the basic sense that are already appropriated.,208,,
1253,0.97,11185.007,11187.709,"Next slide, please.",208,,
1254,0.97,11187.709,11199.621,The proposed budget includes other equity investments in several areas including in our recreation area.,209,,
1255,0.97,11199.621,11223.211,"Since fall of 2020, we have had a team of SPR employees who were Redeveloped to employ career center programming serving 6000 participants from August through December 2020 in the midst of the pandemic . This was with the realization that our community still needed recreation programming but we needed to bring that programming outside of the walls of the shuttered community center.",209,,
1256,0.97,11223.211,11238.86,"This proposed budget transfers $660,000 for multiple funds within our own budget to formalize this mobile recreation pilot . This delivers programming in partnership with communities in the neighborhood and uses equity maps to support it.",209,,
1257,0.97,11238.86,11242.531,Funding will be reallocated from a couple of areas.,209,,
1258,0.97,11242.531,11248.971,"One is from the outdoor opportunities program which represents just under $260,000.",209,,
1259,0.97,11248.971,11257.145,"Then, the operations of the community center which is just under $300,000.",209,,
1260,0.97,11257.145,11258.68,That will establish these two permanent changes.,209,,
1261,0.97,11258.68,11266.355,"In addition, the Department will use Savings plan community center closures for 2022 given we are not able to operate as we were Pre-Pandemic.",209,,
1262,0.97,11266.355,11271.093,That will fund a third temporary team.,209,,
1263,0.97,11271.093,11293.915,"The number you see here of $10,000 reflects an additional small grant . in terms of the next line item, this makes a permanent position that has been placed in early 2020.",209,,
1264,0.97,11293.915,11305.227,This position is a liaison between the Department of parks and recreation and our partners that was created to support the growing body of work that is associated with the program in our facilities.,209,,
1265,0.97,11305.227,11312.701,The position will be funded with revenue generated from third-party preschool programs that operate within the facilities.,209,,
1266,0.97,11312.701,11323.311,It will continue to support the partnership between us and the third-party preschool providers in addition to overall efforts and early learning initiatives.,209,,
1267,0.97,11323.311,11333.955,"Item 8 showed a proposed budget item that provides $200,000 in one time bill funds to rise above.",209,,
1268,0.97,11333.955,11339.928,Rise above provides education and outreach to native youth in the Seattle.,209,,
1269,0.97,11339.928,11344.466,"Council added $100,000 in 2022 this initiative and this increases that to 2022.",209,,
1270,0.97,11344.466,11354.509,"Finally, on this slide, line 9 shows an increase in ongoing appropriation for language service Stipends.",209,,
1271,0.97,11354.509,11373.962,"For the coalition of service collective bargaining agreement, city employees who are Multilingual and provide language services such as interpretation or translation as part of their business related situations are now eligible to receive a monthly Stipend for these language skills.",209,,
1272,0.97,11373.962,11380.202,The amount in 2022 is just an estimate based on an analysis of employees who will be eligible for this.,209,,
1273,0.97,11380.202,11383.672,"Next slide, please.",209,,
1274,0.97,11383.672,11395.751,Our 2022 proposed budget increases funding and staff capacity for our role in maintaining safe spaces in both parks and rights-of-way.,210,,
1275,0.97,11395.751,11398.32,We discussed a couple of these yesterday.,210,,
1276,0.97,11398.32,11402.124,Item 10 refers to clean city funding.,210,,
1277,0.97,11402.124,11445.033,"This is an extension of the funding for the clean city initiative through August 2022 and this allows us to continue to work with the city in partnership with Seattle public utilities . specifically, the proposed budget continues funding to provide enhanced trash removal including dumping, garbage collection, litter pickup, power washing, graffiti removal, storm drain cleaning, lighting, re players and replacement . The work is above and beyond our routine work that typically goes into these areas during the year.",210,,
1278,0.97,11445.033,11452.073,It shows in the front columns that work is part of the Clipper investment.,210,,
1279,0.97,11452.073,11459.848,Item 11--we discussed this one a little bit yesterday.,210,,
1280,0.97,11459.848,11476.798,"This adds $900,000 in additional resources to support the increased demand on SPR in terms of the impacts of serving the unsheltered populations in our parks including litter removal, we take the lead in the storage of personal belongings when folks are connected to housing.",210,,
1281,0.97,11476.798,11501.489,"We also add additional capacity for data collection, reporting, and administrative work . The change in our 2022 proposed budget will assist us in meeting legal requirements and Council patients around this work . item 12, we also discussed this yesterday.",210,,
1282,0.97,11501.489,11511.766,"As our parks have been used differently, there has been lots of damage that has been occurring.",210,,
1283,0.97,11511.766,11520.342,This line item adds $2 million in one-time funding to restore the properties that have been severely damaged.,210,,
1284,0.97,11520.342,11529.518,"This kind of restoration varies by site, depending on the size of damage and the way that it was used.",210,,
1285,0.97,11529.518,11575.363,"This is just an estimate . item 13 also adds funding to support our efforts to encourage park code compliance and address issues related to safety of parks . We are proposing $300,000 to contract with security . This is to support our late-night program as well as the supportive Beach closures . This also adds $40,000 to increase a dispatcher position from Half- time to full-time just to respond to increased call volume.",210,,
1286,0.97,11575.363,11589.01,It also allocates funding as we seek new approaches to investigate best practices across the country as we seek to provide safe outdoor spaces for all community members.,210,,
1287,0.97,11589.01,11592.28,"Finally on this slide, item 14.",210,,
1288,0.97,11592.28,11594.95,It is related to maintenance.,210,,
1289,0.97,11594.95,11599.821,This increases the funding for the maintenance of the Fort Lawton property.,210,,
1290,0.97,11599.821,11612.0,The city is leasing it from the U.S. Army . It allows us to increase security and maintain the site and this represents half of the costs that are being shared with others.,210,,
1291,0.97,11612.0,11616.638,"Next slide, please.",210,,
1292,0.97,11616.638,11667.055,"On the capital side, in addition to the Mpd funding on the previous slide, the 22 proposed budget adds $23 million into capital projects including $16.7 million for major maintenance priorities which--some of the items include things like plumbing for Ada projects, funding to support the blocked project adjusting project that we are in the middle of and also creating a new project for things like the pedestrian bridge . that is $2.2 million in 2022 but we estimate that is a $5 million project.",211,,
1293,0.97,11667.055,11678.199,It also includes the delaying of future projects to accommodate the needs through 2022 and 2024.,211,,
1294,0.97,11678.199,11694.015,$1.25 million have been added to the major project challenge fund to support the small craft center and their fundraising efforts as well as the South Park community center . that builds on the $1.5 million.,211,,

1296,0.97,11710.432,11720.442,"Go ahead and go to the last on here, the park fund balance on item 16.",212,,
1297,0.97,11720.442,11724.979,"As Council is aware, we provided a reliable funding source to allow us to pay the operation Commission.",212,,
1298,0.97,11724.979,11735.657,It allowed us to retain our employees to provide parks and recreation services as being safe.,212,,
1299,0.97,11735.657,11746.367,"In addition, throughout the pandemic, we implemented a pretty significant and very conservative fiscal management approach to our expenditure.",212,,
1300,0.97,11746.367,11771.259,"As a result of the great depth of our staff, we were able to identify $9.5 million of fund balance in our park fund it will be used to utilize certain capital projects that were implemented during the pandemic . This includes restoring $3.5 million toward developing new parks and land banks that we have been working toward.",212,,
1301,0.97,11771.259,11775.096,It is also important to note that in 2020 we allocated $4.7 million of park district money.,212,,
1302,0.97,11775.096,11778.099,It impacted numerous projects.,212,,
1303,0.97,11778.099,11784.806,We are Replenishing $1 million from acquisition funding here.,212,,
1304,0.97,11784.806,11788.71,We are also establishing a $5 million reserve for the future renovation of the Lake City committee center.,212,,
1305,0.97,11788.71,11802.524,It is important to note that this commitment is in addition to the funding of $11.5 million plus a $5 million commitment that is made in the endorsed budget that would be funded as part of the next cycle of the parks district.,212,,
1306,0.97,11802.524,11809.464,"As we know, this gets us much closer to fully funding the project.",212,,
1307,0.97,11809.464,11815.103,"Then, of course, we will align all of the funding sources for the projects.",212,,
1308,0.97,11815.103,11817.305,"Next slide, please.",212,,
1309,0.97,11817.305,11828.716,"Finally, I want to reiterate the equity in aligning our fiscal resources to the value of equity and the commitment of the organization.",213,,
1310,0.97,11828.716,11855.777,"Overall, our 2022 proposed budget has equity with both operating and capital proposals . We take this approach in support of a need to recover from the global pandemic and associated economic crises along with a need to meet with deliberate strategies to respond to the racial reckoning highlighting this historical and ongoing systemic racism that exists in our institution.",213,,
1311,0.97,11855.777,11874.996,"These investments are in addition to the equity work we already do as part of our daily operation including contracting with firms, advancing equity in our hiring practices and to require our training like get moving to focus on Bicop communities.",213,,
1312,0.97,11874.996,11887.575,The changes are being built on our overall effort and we continue to build an Antiracist workforce and workplace and to lead with equity in how we deliver services to the community.,213,,
1313,0.97,11887.575,11894.916,"With that, I know we are short on time so I will stop and I'm happy to answer any questions.",213,,
1314,0.97,11894.916,11898.386,Thank you very much.,214,,
1315,0.97,11898.386,11903.691,"Council member Juarez, any councils?",214,,
1316,0.97,11903.691,11907.528,This has been a really interesting budget cycle.,215,,
1317,0.97,11907.528,11926.648,"As you know, Seattle parks and Rec, their duties and responsibilities and the corresponding budget reports spans between many departments now that we did not do in the past, most notably with Sdot and others including the King County regional housing authority.",215,,
1318,0.97,11926.648,11933.755,We have this presentation today on clean cities.,215,,
1319,0.97,11933.755,11934.956,I want to focus on that.,215,,
1320,0.97,11934.956,11942.664,"Yesterday, when we went through the citywide homelessness response, notably slide three and 22.",215,,
1321,0.97,11942.664,11945.266,"This afternoon, with the Covid response and recovery, page 21.",215,,
1322,0.97,11945.266,11967.722,We have parks doing things that they did not traditionally do but are responding to and have been laser focused on the pandemic . We are asking more of our employees . We are requesting we work with Jesus on this on the training in the data but also laser focused on Park employee safety.,215,,
1323,0.97,11967.722,11981.936,"That being said, I wanted to point out that I am glad we are restoring but I would like to see more.",215,,
1324,0.97,11981.936,11982.904,$7.7 million back into parks.,215,,
1325,0.97,11982.904,11998.319,"Both parks and libraries gave up money out of their budget back to the general fund to respond to Covid . I'm glad to hear that we have been able to retain our employees, which has been great.",215,,
1326,0.97,11998.319,12007.295,We do want to expand the training and the data so we cannot have people doing jobs that they did not sign up to do . This last year has been very intense about employee safety.,215,,
1327,0.97,12007.295,12015.703,We have met with labor and folks about what that means and we see that is provided for in this budget.,215,,
1328,0.97,12015.703,12020.241,My only concern on the clean city initiative--two things.,215,,
1329,0.97,12020.241,12034.622,We are going to be working with Sdot--you have been working with Sdot and others since the winter . We have been Cordoning that and now we will fold in the King County regional housing authority.,215,,
1330,0.97,12034.622,12037.825,We have been doing that and it looks like we are more Institutionalizing it.,215,,
1331,0.97,12037.825,12058.679,"With all of that in mind--I know we have three presentations going that are all focused on parks and the clean city initiative and also having the Sanitation systems, the Handwashing, also picking up the needles in the trash.",215,,
1332,0.97,12058.679,12064.752,My concern is this . We talked about this so I'm not doing a Gotcha thing.,215,,
1333,0.97,12064.752,12069.457,I am concerned that we are only funded through August 2022.,215,,
1334,0.97,12069.457,12073.094,I don't think we will be out of the woods on the pandemic or the homelessness crisis.,215,,
1335,0.97,12073.094,12082.603,"Even before we had Covid, we had been seeing what the hygiene issues are . We have talked about it with Spu as well.",215,,
1336,0.97,12082.603,12101.923,The good thing that has come out of this is the organization and the delegating and how this city Department has been working really well with Sdot and Spu and now Hsb King County.,215,,
1337,0.97,12101.923,12107.228,"The next six months, we will have a better sense of how that all Gels with some of these folks merging into King County housing authority.",215,,
1338,0.97,12107.228,12120.408,I like what Councilmember Morales asked yesterday which continues to push that we keep the geographic entity piece in there that we are focusing on the nonprofit groups that are already providing services to those particular neighborhoods to get people indoors.,215,,
1339,0.97,12120.408,12131.319,"As you know and what I have learned from your employees, parks is doing more than just cleaning up and restoring, particularly with community centers.",215,,
1340,0.97,12131.319,12138.092,I appreciate the presentations and the presentation we will have this afternoon.,215,,
1341,0.97,12138.092,12152.073,"I was looking at it on page 21, the clean city initiative . What I will be coming back at and what I will ask my colleagues to take a second look at is that executives should rule beyond August 2022.",215,,
1342,0.97,12152.073,12154.542,I know why.,215,,
1343,0.97,12154.542,12167.355,As we all have learned that the homelessness crisis is not going to go away.,215,,
1344,0.97,12167.355,12176.864,"Everyone should have a homelessness plan whether they are Washd.O.T., Sdot, sound transit, the city of Seattle.",215,,
1345,0.97,12176.864,12178.699,We all have to do this and have them plan.,215,,
1346,0.97,12178.699,12186.407,"Should be part of a governmental function, a service that is funded and not just a one and done deal.",215,,
1347,0.97,12186.407,12191.712,I think this will be part of what government delivers.,215,,
1348,0.97,12191.712,12197.585,Thank you.,215,,
1349,0.97,12197.585,12198.486,"Well said, Councilmember Juarez.",216,,
1350,0.97,12198.486,12202.29,Thank you for your leadership on this Committee.,216,,
1351,0.97,12202.29,12208.329,I want to reiterate what Councilmember Juarez said before I turn it over for any comments.,216,,
1352,0.97,12208.329,12221.542,You have heard a large number of the Councilmembers over the last 2 1/2 days talk about how health and hygiene along with housing are our top priorities.,216,,
1353,0.97,12221.542,12223.21,I want to explore what Councilmember Juarez just said.,216,,
1354,0.97,12223.21,12235.156,That is traditionally not what parks has taken on and how we address this budget going forward over the next two months.,216,,
1355,0.97,12235.156,12249.57,"It will be imperative for me that we center our conversations around health, hygiene, and housing and that we ask ourselves the right questions about whether or not that is being housed internally in the right place to make sure we are setting you all up for success so the community can be successful.",216,,
1356,0.97,12249.57,12261.182,"I know there will be more conversations on that but for our Council, this will be a huge priority to see that for calendar year 2022.",216,,
1357,0.97,12261.182,12264.385,I appreciate those comments.,217,,
1358,0.97,12264.385,12270.291,I very much appreciate it.,217,,
1359,0.97,12270.291,12290.211,"It is also important, as you both have said, to recognize that the staff of Seattle parks and recreation really step up throughout the pandemic . not just to do what we could within the Regulr work but really doing much, much more than we normally do . Our staff are the kind of individuals who step up and do what is necessary.",217,,
1360,0.97,12290.211,12293.714,"That said, their work has changed dramatically.",217,,
1361,0.97,12293.714,12307.495,We need to focus on ensuring that they have the capacity to clean up as well as the support in making sure that we are thinking through what is appropriate for staff members to be doing.,217,,
1362,0.97,12307.495,12331.052,"I appreciate that we can continue to have those conversations . I will end with expressing my gratitude to the team at Seattle parks and recreation for always stepping up . Councilmember Juarez, with regard to the clean cities initiative, we included it through August.",217,,
1363,0.97,12331.052,12341.629,The idea is they will supplement and enhance what we normally do on a regular basis.,217,,
1364,0.97,12341.629,12347.068,"As this pandemic has been unpredictable, we understand that those things change.",217,,
1365,0.97,12347.068,12354.775,We are happy to work with you to think about what that Council will mean.,217,,
1366,0.97,12354.775,12358.679,Thank you.,217,,
1367,0.97,12358.679,12363.351,Thank you very much for those comments.,218,,
1368,0.97,12363.351,12368.389,"I am not seeing--accuse me, council member Juarez, did you have anything else?",218,,
1369,0.97,12368.389,12371.258,I am not seeing any additional hands right now.,218,,
1370,0.97,12371.258,12372.96,I want to just ask one very brief question.,218,,
1371,0.97,12372.96,12382.403,"On slide five, it talks about the Southpark community center.",218,,
1372,0.97,12382.403,12405.793,"For investments that are looking at expanding the Duwamish program, we know there are community goals around nonprofit space . is there an opportunity for community members to engage even further in the investments in the Duwamish Valley for potential community ownership, we have heard a lot of frustration over the years.",218,,
1373,0.97,12405.793,12419.707,Folks have wanted to have leadership . any thoughts about community ownership as we look at that?,218,,
1374,0.97,12419.707,12422.643,Thank you.,219,,
1375,0.97,12422.643,12435.055,I appreciate that and certainly appreciate the community's interest.,219,,
1376,0.97,12435.055,12448.869,"One project that I am excited about that just closed, which is purchasing a property, the idea is we've got a few years to figure out what to do with it.",219,,
1377,0.97,12448.869,12452.773,We accepted the lease that is currently on site.,219,,
1378,0.97,12452.773,12463.284,The idea is to work with our partners here to figure out what we can do there.,219,,
1379,0.97,12463.284,12476.497,We want to be very thoughtful about the Legalities of the funding and how we can do that but that is certainly something we are interested in trying to sort through.,219,,
1380,0.97,12476.497,12477.498,Thank you so much.,220,,
1381,0.97,12477.498,12485.005,We have one more minute . I will turn it over to Councilmember Herbold for a very brief question.,220,,
1382,0.97,12485.005,12485.673,Thank you.,221,,
1383,0.97,12485.673,12490.311,I just want to--this is a question about Southpark.,221,,
1384,0.97,12490.311,12510.231,We know Tht because of renovations in the side of the building as well as improvements in the upcoming year that the community center is planned to be closed in the fourth quarter of next year.,221,,
1385,0.97,12510.231,12523.41,I just want to highlight that historically there was a lot of activity that goes on in this building and the community has so many barriers for the rest of the city.,221,,
1386,0.97,12523.41,12527.147,There is an increase input traffic with the bridge closure.,221,,
1387,0.97,12527.147,12540.06,"The improvements are roof replacement, Hvac system upgrades, renovation of kitchen spaces.",221,,
1388,0.97,12540.06,12550.838,I am concerned that this work will require that the facility be closed for more than a year.,221,,
1389,0.97,12550.838,12553.073,What else is available to the young people?,221,,
1390,0.97,12553.073,12559.58,That neighborhood has the highest per capita of any neighborhood in the city.,221,,
1391,0.97,12559.58,12578.866,I want to understand what we have planned as an alternative for recreation opportunities beyond the investments that we are making with youth leadership in the Duwamish action plan.,221,,
1392,0.97,12578.866,12579.266,Thank you.,222,,
1393,0.97,12579.266,12579.7,I agree.,222,,
1394,0.97,12579.7,12581.802,This is a challenge we have been working through.,222,,
1395,0.97,12581.802,12586.574,We started these conversations Pre-Pandemic.,222,,
1396,0.97,12586.574,12591.712,We have not yet found an alternate site.,222,,
1397,0.97,12591.712,12593.647,We will work to see what we can do.,222,,
1398,0.97,12593.647,12597.151,"On one level, this is a tremendously exciting project because the entire campus will get transformed.",222,,
1399,0.97,12597.151,12620.908,It is great but we've got to work through the challenge here on the interim pace . one of the proposals we've got in this budget is this idea of wreck in the streets.,222,,
1400,0.97,12620.908,12624.144,We need to move our recreation and programming outside of the walls of the community center.,222,,
1401,0.97,12624.144,12628.248,This was not even Pre-Pandemic.,222,,
1402,0.97,12628.248,12631.518,We want to go out to communities to try to do as much programming as possible.,222,,
1403,0.97,12631.518,12636.857,We will be doing some of that but this is a challenge we are trying to resolve.,222,,
1404,0.97,12636.857,12641.228,Great question.,223,,
1405,0.97,12641.228,12643.731,Thank you very much.,223,,
1406,0.97,12643.731,12657.678,I am not seeing additional questions . We see parts of parks represented in almost every presentation.,223,,
1407,0.97,12657.678,12669.056,Thank you to your team members who we know have truly been a central in this time of the pandemic and in many ways have put their health and their family health on the line by being out there every time.,223,,
1408,0.97,12669.056,12673.494,You have helped to create more healthy communities for everyone.,223,,
1409,0.97,12673.494,12677.197,Lays pass on our appreciation and we look forward to working with you over the next two months.,223,,
1410,0.97,12677.197,12687.307,We will have questions to come about how we can support you all and make sure we are appropriately housing our outreach and cleanup in the right spot.,223,,
1411,0.97,12687.307,12689.176,I know there will be future questions on that.,223,,
1412,0.97,12689.176,12696.283,Thank you for the work you have done and on top of your already busy workloads.,223,,
1413,0.97,12696.283,12696.717,We appreciate you.,223,,

1418,0.97,12708.228,12708.896,Thank you.,225,,
1419,0.97,12708.896,12711.498,We are going to go into Recess if there is no objection.,225,,
