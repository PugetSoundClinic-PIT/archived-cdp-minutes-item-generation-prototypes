356,0.97,2075.44,2077.074,The community recommends the bill pass.,78,,
357,0.97,2077.074,2082.146,Thank you so much.,79,,
358,0.97,2082.146,2085.349,"Councilmember Mosqueda, back to you to provide us this Committee report.",79,,
359,0.97,2085.349,2088.019,"Thank you very much, Council president and colleagues.",80,,
360,0.97,2088.019,2103.267,"Again, this is the item that came from the housing and Finance Committee . that came to us from the office of housing to accept the land transfer from the sound transit to office of housing for the purpose of developing four purpose affordable homes.",80,,
361,0.97,2103.267,2108.94,There are three main paints I'd really like to highlight.,80,,
362,0.97,2108.94,2111.375,The first is the city is accepting this land at no cost.,80,,
363,0.97,2111.375,2120.685,This is possible through our commitment to the land disposition policies that we have seen really featured in sound transit first.,80,,
364,0.97,2120.685,2126.791,What I Replicated as well in our land passed in 2019.,80,,
365,0.97,2126.791,2137.168,"This is our city's commitment to making sure we have surplus or UNDERUSED land, especially with starting with sound transit, that we make sure this property is available to the highest and best public use.",80,,
366,0.97,2137.168,2139.203,"Right now, that is housing.",80,,
367,0.97,2139.203,2146.31,The second thing to consider is this land is located in the South end near three light rail stations.,80,,
368,0.97,2146.31,2158.723,It is a response to the community's ongoing demand for more affordable housing located in these existing communities that have seen a tremendous amount of displacement and skyrocketing cost of housing over the years.,80,,
369,0.97,2158.723,2164.996,"Again, with the need to make sure that we address housing, it's not just building more affordable units.",80,,
370,0.97,2164.996,2171.102,"It's also creating opportunities for people to have homeownership opportunities, which this ordinance allows.",80,,
371,0.97,2171.102,2177.341,"A final thing is that this focus, as I just mentioned, is on creating for purchase housing.",80,,
372,0.97,2177.341,2186.918,"This plan provides accessible homeownership opportunities for Seattle residents, creating a path out of generational poverty and allowing folks to create greater equity in the pocket.",80,,
373,0.97,2186.918,2215.179,"This is also a commitment to our equity principles for more people to be able to have a place to call home that they can own, which allows for folks to build wealth in their own community the last one I think is extremely important as we recognize this disproportionate amount of wealth in Seattle compared to black and Brown households which can be traced back to our Exclusionary policies of Redlining that present many black communities from being able to purchase their homes in the city of Seattle.",80,,
374,0.97,2215.179,2235.6,"This is not only part of our passed, but it is still the living policy of our city . We are really trying to provide more opportunities for now for folks to be able to continue to afford to live in the city according to a report released by prosperity now, the Pre- Covid medium well for a white resident in Seattle was three times higher than that of native American household, black residents were three times more likely to be unemployed.",80,,
375,0.97,2235.6,2243.808,This all compounds to few opportunities to allow for folks to be able to own homes in the city.,80,,
376,0.97,2243.808,2255.186,This opportunity is one way that the city can begin to address the passed and begin to help close the wage gap as we report many opportunities for future affordable housing options.,80,,
377,0.97,2255.186,2266.731,And homeownership options to ensure that more Bipoc communities can continue to live and thrive in our Seattle--in Seattle for generations to come.,80,,
378,0.97,2266.731,2286.45,"Will continue to do more work to close this gap and I look forward to more funding opportunities in housing and equitable development, and especially using our Jumpstart Seattle dollars about two thirds of those dollars going into housing, and home opportunities and especially making sure those who don't have opportunities have a place to call home and appropriate shelter.",80,,
379,0.97,2286.45,2294.358,This is an indication of our ongoing commitment to the need for creating more affordable and accessible housing and addressing the disparities within our city.,80,,
380,0.97,2294.358,2296.027,Looking forward to this legislation being passed today.,80,,
381,0.97,2296.027,2298.062,You very much.,80,,
382,0.97,2298.062,2300.464,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Mosqueda.",81,,
383,0.97,2300.464,2302.066,Any other comments on the bill?,81,,
384,0.97,2302.066,2303.934,Councilmember Morales please.,81,,
385,0.97,2303.934,2307.171,Thank you.,82,,
386,0.97,2307.171,2312.076,I just want to share that I am very excited about this legislation.,82,,
387,0.97,2312.076,2317.948,This is an opportunity to create more permanently affordable homeownership.,82,,
388,0.97,2317.948,2323.854,"Not just rental units, but homeownership opportunities, particularly in the South end.",82,,
389,0.97,2323.854,2331.362,"That means that these homes will be affordable not just for the future homebuyer, but for the subsequent homebuyers too.",82,,
390,0.97,2331.362,2345.376,"The rental homebuyer will get a reasonable rate of return myself, but the price will still allow the next owner to also participate and enjoy the benefits of homeownership I think this is a really important opportunity.",82,,
391,0.97,2345.376,2349.613,I do want to also note that there has been a really important in community engagement process for years.,82,,
392,0.97,2349.613,2352.683,To make sure that this happens.,82,,
393,0.97,2352.683,2369.934,I want to thank Puget sound Sage for advocating and helping pass the legislation that requires sound transit to over 80% of their search plus properties to organizations that are doing low income housing.,82,,
394,0.97,2369.934,2376.64,This is really a chance for those of us in the South end to move passed the numerous fenced off lots that have lined the light rail stations for the last 10 years.,82,,
395,0.97,2376.64,2391.222,Really excited to see that the fenced off lots along the way are starting to be used and that this in particular will be used for homeownership opportunities.,82,,
396,0.97,2391.222,2401.031,"So, just want to say thank you again for sponsoring this, leading this, Councilmember Mosqueda.",82,,
397,0.97,2401.031,2409.473,I do want to also thank director Alvarado and others for working so hard on this bit really looking forward to more homeownership opportunities in the South end.,82,,
398,0.97,2409.473,2410.541,Thank you.,82,,
399,0.97,2410.541,2415.646,Thank you so much Councilmember Morales.,83,,
400,0.97,2415.646,2417.281,Couldn't agree with you more.,83,,
401,0.97,2417.281,2433.097,It's important for us to serve and support affordable pathways to those units in our community that are only subject to rent.,83,,
402,0.97,2433.097,2437.368,We know that over 50% of the people in this city rent.,83,,
403,0.97,2437.368,2441.205,I think the last time I looked about 30% of those Renters are Bipoc folks.,83,,
404,0.97,2441.205,2458.522,Obviously the most important critical thing that we can do to ensure that we are actually making a difference in terms of closing the wealth gap and income inequality is to allow people opportunities to have affordable homeownership really excited about this bill.,83,,
405,0.97,2458.522,2467.431,"Sorry that I wasn't in committee to vote it out of committee, but I'm really excited about continuing to support this bill.",83,,
406,0.97,2467.431,2470.501,Thanks to everyone for playing a really important role in getting a in front of us.,83,,

412,0.97,2502.166,2504.168,I want to thank a few people.,84,,
413,0.97,2504.168,2518.649,"Director Alvarado, as has been pointed out, has really been spearheading this making sure there are more opportunities like this.",84,,
414,0.97,2518.649,2528.993,"Obviously much more work to come and we will continue to follow up to make sure it's not just affordable housing opportunities that we are creating for Renters and First- time buyers, but that pipeline so that people have that next plate to buy.",84,,
415,0.97,2528.993,2533.063,There truly is a place to move into as people acquire additional equity.,84,,
416,0.97,2533.063,2536.7,That the next generation or the next folks get a chance to move into these homes as well.,84,,
417,0.97,2536.7,2540.571,It requires us to continue building.,84,,

665,0.97,4082.044,4106.068,"That is to make sure that the discussion in the future conversations really involve an approach to our investments in Tansportation and infrastructure that recognized that overlapping opportunities, overlapping investments between our aging infrastructure like bridges, and things that we should be carrying over those bridges, including buses and safer pathways for Walkers, for Bicyclists, for all those who need to use a Stroller.",147,,
666,0.97,4106.068,4108.27,Of their own or to push a Stroller for their Kiddos.,147,,

672,0.97,4127.189,4132.094,I did want to take a quick second to recognize all of those who have called in we have offered public comment as well.,147,,
673,0.97,4132.094,4137.7,And for the Comps that were made today about the opportunity for bonding to allow for us to put back back to work.,147,,
674,0.97,4137.7,4150.513,"Putting people back to work especially for those who have lost their work or small businesses in the wake of Covid, offers us a chance to Frontload these dollars to invest in infrastructure projects, or dollars that will allow for family wage jobs.",147,,
675,0.97,4150.513,4152.781,As part of our commitment to equitable recovery.,147,,
676,0.97,4152.781,4159.488,I think that by bonding in this moment we can push forward a green Knoll deal type of proposal.,147,,
677,0.97,4159.488,4176.539,"It is not just new deal like, by putting people to work, but it could be like the green new deal in that we are bringing together I think it was a commitment in this revised legislation in front of us that really do complement our commitment to a blue-green coalition.",147,,

679,0.97,4183.245,4195.024,I do think that we can do it both end approach and I'm hopeful that the plan and the presentation in front of us this fall will allow for us to see that there is a Pathway forward to doing so.,147,,
680,0.97,4195.024,4205.968,"I know that we all are cognizant of the fact that cars and single occupancy vehicles are one of the largest sources, if not the largest source of climate emissions in Seattle.",147,,
681,0.97,4205.968,4210.072,Our commitment continues to be to reduce climate emissions.,147,,
682,0.97,4210.072,4224.286,"So, as we rebuild our infrastructure as this proposal in front of us outlines, I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to marry these dollars with our commitments to create more Multimodal transportation options.",147,,
683,0.97,4224.286,4230.559,That we can have a better sense of the total universe of dollars available for this both end approach.,147,,

685,0.97,4242.638,4264.093,"I do want to thank the Councilmember sure I already mentioned, and the Stakeholder process that brought together the initial proposal, and I believe by allowing those initial recommendations to move forward now, and not bonding against though dollars in this year's allocation we will be able to see a significant improvement in just infrastructure in front of us in this first year.",147,,
686,0.97,4264.093,4272.835,"Then, when we get the report in front of us, make sure that we can implement these Federal and state dollars with our intended effort here to bond.",147,,
687,0.97,4272.835,4277.306,I think it is an opportunity for us to really put people back to work and to do so through inequity lands.,147,,
688,0.97,4277.306,4281.343,Of making sure that those who have lost their livelihoods really do have an opportunity to come back.,147,,

694,0.97,4308.771,4310.973,That we must take into consideration as well.,147,,
695,0.97,4310.973,4326.455,"It's really important from my perspective that we take a realistic look at those recommendations because not only do we want to put these funding dollars to use very quickly, but we need to make sure that we are honoring our promises made through the levies, and making those commitments to voters.",147,,
696,0.97,4326.455,4332.294,So that voters see what they asked us to invest in really did get funded.,147,,
697,0.97,4332.294,4351.013,"There is going to be a lot of opportunities coming forward for us to I think Recommit to both end approach and make sure we are fulfilling our obligation to not only move individual single occupancy cars, and goods, but also people safely.",147,,
698,0.97,4351.013,4358.921,My interest continues to be in examining and Prioritizing infrastructure projects that can do this both work and put people back to work now.,147,,

700,0.97,4362.591,4380.442,"I think it's the right thing to do to look for opportunities to put people to work now, and I'm really also interested in hearing more about the project list that comes forward, and hearing more about where each project list can support these Multimodal transit options and how we can put people to work.",147,,

709,0.97,4441.203,4447.91,We need to have a good understanding of what our bonding needs are and what the schedule of those needs are.,149,,
710,0.97,4447.91,4470.032,"So that we are not paying bankers interest on money we can't use, before we are ready to use it, and I think it's important for us all colleagues, that when we ask Stakeholder groups and departments like Sdot to run a Stakeholder process, that we honor what they bring to us in their reports.",149,,
