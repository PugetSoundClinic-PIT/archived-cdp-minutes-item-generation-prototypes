25,0.97,80.046,83.683,"President's report we have a very, very, very full agenda this morning.",20,,
26,0.97,83.683,86.252,I'm going to dispense with that report in the interest of time.,20,,
27,0.97,86.252,91.191,And transition first into the presentation of the Council briefing.,20,,
28,0.97,91.191,93.126,"Again, we have a lot on the agenda today.",20,,

31,0.97,105.972,111.911,Which counselor Morales is going to introduce and make some introductory comments about.,20,,

34,0.97,127.527,133.032,"So Councilmember, Morales, good morning at the floor is yours.",20,,
35,0.97,133.032,134.033,Thank you so much.,21,,
36,0.97,134.033,134.634,Good morning colleagues.,21,,
37,0.97,134.634,138.037,As you know the community economic development committee has not been meeting.,21,,
38,0.97,138.037,149.249,"Nevertheless, I have been meeting regularly with Community-Based organizations and small businesses to continue our discussion about how we build community wealth in Seattle.",21,,
39,0.97,149.249,157.357,"This is even more important now that we are facing a recession, and a very long economic recovery.",21,,
40,0.97,157.357,161.094,It's really important that we begin to think strategically about how we rebuild our communities.,21,,
41,0.97,161.094,164.731,In a way that ensures the resilience of our neighbors.,21,,
42,0.97,164.731,168.968,That ensures worker protections and small business Sustainability.,21,,
43,0.97,168.968,175.742,Also the rights for our low income neighbors and our black and Brown communities to stay rooted in their neighborhoods.,21,,
44,0.97,175.742,178.678,We know our current economic system doesn't service all equitably.,21,,
45,0.97,178.678,189.556,"My hope is that we, as we think about what the next system looks like, that our decisions are rooted in how we take care of one another.",21,,
46,0.97,189.556,195.695,"So, we have the opportunity to put in place systems that will prevent disaster Gentrification.",21,,
47,0.97,195.695,199.065,Prevent the displacement of our community members.,21,,
48,0.97,199.065,205.505,We need solutions that ensure everyone gets to benefit from the city's recovery strategies and programs.,21,,
49,0.97,205.505,212.412,"That includes facilitating public investment, to stave off massive unemployment.",21,,
50,0.97,212.412,214.614,"Ensuring community ownership of lands, and building wealth for our neighbors.",21,,
51,0.97,214.614,223.423,"So, I have asked Oed to share with us the results of their first round of the business stabilization funding.",21,,
52,0.97,223.423,231.898,"Their approach for the second round, and also some lessons learned for how to reach businesses most impacted by the current situation.",21,,
53,0.97,231.898,243.242,"Then, I've also asked Beto Yarce of ventures and Marie Kurose of the workforce development Council to brief us today on what challenges they see.",21,,
54,0.97,243.242,251.251,And what the Council should be thinking about as we plan for a more adjust future where we broaden economic opportunities for everyone.,21,,
55,0.97,251.251,257.39,"So, I will turn it over, are we hearing from director Lee first?",21,,
56,0.97,257.39,259.525,Sure.,22,,
57,0.97,259.525,260.96,If that's okay.,22,,
58,0.97,260.96,261.527,All right.,22,,
59,0.97,261.527,263.663,I'll get started.,22,,
60,0.97,263.663,274.34,Thank you so much for this opportunity for Oed to present on our work around small business stabilization fund.,22,,
61,0.97,274.34,276.776,I'll be really brief because I know you have a full agenda.,22,,
62,0.97,276.776,279.479,If there are questions we can guide them for more of the details.,22,,
63,0.97,279.479,287.387,"As all of you know, excuse me, in the United States, Seattle regional was the first to face this historic pandemic.",22,,
64,0.97,287.387,295.895,"I the time the Federal Government and the nation started to pay attention, many of our Seattle small businesses were already laying off their employees.",22,,
65,0.97,295.895,298.765,"In just a few weeks, unemployment claims jumped over tenfold.",22,,
66,0.97,298.765,303.87,"As a result, we had to move quickly.",22,,
67,0.97,303.87,311.31,The pandemic is also having disproportionate impact to small businesses owned by people of color and immigrants and refugees.,22,,
68,0.97,311.31,317.817,"Many are still on their own, hoping for unemployment and shipment programs to scale up.",22,,
69,0.97,317.817,328.227,"With Washington's Constitution, Federal dollars, were the only fund available at that time.",22,,
70,0.97,328.227,333.9,But this fund was also limited enough for only 250 small businesses.,22,,
71,0.97,333.9,336.936,It comes with Federal requirements.,22,,
72,0.97,336.936,350.85,"At this time, before I turn it over to Pedro, I would like to also thank other city departments.",22,,
73,0.97,350.85,355.221,For Redeploying their own staff to help us with this project.,22,,
74,0.97,355.221,365.131,We had additional 20 staff that was reassigned to help Oed as many work late nights and over the weekends to complete this project.,22,,
75,0.97,365.131,376.542,"With that I'll turn it over to Pedro Gomez, who was the project sponsor for the small business stabilization fund program and has worked tirelessly to make this project a success.",22,,
76,0.97,376.542,379.078,"With that, I'll turn it over to Pedro.",22,,
77,0.97,379.078,381.38,"Thank you, director Lee.",23,,
78,0.97,381.38,391.691,I'm going to go ahead and share my screen so I can go over to presentation.,23,,
79,0.97,391.691,394.66,Okay.,23,,
80,0.97,394.66,399.565,My first time presenting on zoom.,23,,
81,0.97,399.565,401.768,Can everyone see?,23,,
82,0.97,401.768,404.203,Can folks see my screen?,23,,
83,0.97,404.203,408.808,"Yes, we can see it.",24,,
84,0.97,408.808,409.509,"Okay, perfect.",25,,
85,0.97,409.509,414.113,"It's also my first time presenting to city Council, so very interesting that I'm doing it via zoom.",25,,
86,0.97,414.113,416.415,Good morning everyone.,25,,
87,0.97,416.415,421.821,Thank you for the invitation to present on the stabilization fund.,25,,
88,0.97,421.821,435.635,It's a project that I think was--I'm not only speaking for myself but for the many staff that worked on it.,25,,
89,0.97,435.635,444.01,"Not only because of the many hours that were spent on this, but because of the difficult conversations we have had to have Withbusiness owners.",25,,
90,0.97,444.01,448.114,Talking to hundreds of Emails and phone numbers.,25,,
91,0.97,448.114,453.119,"With that, I'll just jump right in.",25,,
92,0.97,453.119,461.027,"So, the small business stabilization Fund, this was an expansion of a program--a pilot program we launched last year.",25,,
93,0.97,461.027,467.333,"Was an emergency fund that provided working capital to small businesses in the amount of $10,000.",25,,
94,0.97,467.333,474.04,The fund--it is funded by city dollars.,25,,
95,0.97,474.04,477.543,We initially started with 2.5 million earlier this year.,25,,
96,0.97,477.543,482.348,"Now, the Mayor is proposing adding another 1.5.",25,,
97,0.97,482.348,493.159,The Mayor directed us to make sure we were focusing the outreach on historically Underserved.,25,,
98,0.97,493.159,505.504,"One of the things we knew was going to happen, and now it is proven to have happened, is that the loans and programs being offered by our Federal Government were not going to reach community, all communities the same way.",25,,
99,0.97,505.504,514.714,"So, we wanted to make sure that we made this as big of an effort to reach all communities, particularly those that are Underserved.",25,,
100,0.97,514.714,518.084,And had people do that.,25,,
101,0.97,518.084,527.493,"In order to help with that, because we were weighing out what was going to be better.",25,,
102,0.97,527.493,529.528,"If it is first come first served, or something else.",25,,
103,0.97,529.528,533.799,"First come first served, just wasn't going to work for those communities.",25,,
104,0.97,533.799,544.81,"Given access to resources, and other information, sometimes folks in our community are just not going to be the first ones to apply.",25,,
105,0.97,544.81,553.552,We decided to go with a lottery process to ensure that grants were awarded to businesses.,25,,
106,0.97,553.552,559.225,"With that process, it resulted in nearly 80% of grants going to businesses that identify as people of color.",25,,
107,0.97,559.225,567.533,"On the right, you will see a map of the folks that received the grant.",25,,
108,0.97,567.533,573.139,The dots in blue are businesses that are located in high displacement areas.,25,,
109,0.97,573.139,575.575,The dots in Orange are low displacement areas.,25,,
110,0.97,575.575,585.384,"After about, I think it was 10--I think it was like 12 days that we left the application process open.",25,,
111,0.97,585.384,589.455,We received 9000 applications from business owners.,25,,
112,0.97,589.455,592.658,Nearly 9000 applications from business owners.,25,,
113,0.97,592.658,597.196,A lot of those were not located in Seattle.,25,,
114,0.97,597.196,599.999,We actually got applications from as far as Miami and New York and other places.,25,,
115,0.97,599.999,601.5,"So, we had to get those out.",25,,
116,0.97,601.5,613.512,"After we removed those businesses we were left with approximately 6000, of which 252 received a $10,000 grant.",25,,
117,0.97,613.512,616.215,Outreach was conducted in collaboration with our neighborhood district partners.,25,,
118,0.97,616.215,623.389,"So, local, merchants associations, small chambers, other community groups like ventures.",25,,
119,0.97,623.389,625.925,I see Bethel on here.,25,,
120,0.97,625.925,629.228,They were super helpful as well to get the word out.,25,,
121,0.97,629.228,634.033,Social media of course was used.,25,,
122,0.97,634.033,637.937,We also posted regular updates on our Website and through our weekly Webinar that we conduct every Wednesday.,25,,
123,0.97,637.937,647.113,Which by the way is attracting anywhere from 150 to 200 business owners every Wednesday.,25,,
124,0.97,647.113,650.149,That's also been a great outlet.,25,,
125,0.97,650.149,653.219,"In addition to that, our triage team.",25,,
126,0.97,653.219,659.425,That is the team in our office that is focused on responding to phone calls and Emails.,25,,
127,0.97,659.425,666.365,"They were receiving, they were responding to over 100.",25,,
128,0.97,666.365,675.941,This team used to be just one person right at the front desk that would work on these Emails.,25,,
129,0.97,675.941,680.98,"Because of the stabilization Fund, and because of the number of calls and Emails we are getting, they played a key role.",25,,
130,0.97,680.98,684.517,We ended up expanding that team to six or seven folks that spent hours and hours responding.,25,,
131,0.97,684.517,696.862,"By the way, this particular effort has proven to be very meaningful to small businesses.",25,,
132,0.97,696.862,701.267,I can't say how many business owners are just happy to be able to talk to someone.,25,,
133,0.97,701.267,707.606,"During these times, people are not picking up their phones, not responding to their Emails.",25,,
134,0.97,707.606,711.477,"We were, so that proved to be a huge success.",25,,
135,0.97,711.477,717.016,"So, here is one family that received the stabilization fund.",25,,
136,0.97,717.016,732.631,"It is a restaurant called foreign Hi the owner, who is on the left-hand side, he employs his parents, and he employs his brother, and not in the picture is also his wife.",25,,
137,0.97,732.631,735.301,It is a family owned restaurant.,25,,
138,0.97,735.301,743.409,"Because they are located in Belltown, they depend a ton on the workers from Amazon and others in South Lake Union.",25,,
139,0.97,743.409,747.246,"Since everyone started working from home, their business dipped 80%.",25,,
140,0.97,747.246,754.587,"The last time I talked to them, this last week, when I called to check on him, it was about 4:00.",25,,
141,0.97,754.587,755.754,They had only made 80 bucks.,25,,
142,0.97,755.754,757.556,"It has been a tough, tough time.",25,,
143,0.97,757.556,764.13,They have been dealing with this stabilization fund.,25,,
144,0.97,764.13,770.97,Is going to help them at least remain in their a couple more months.,25,,
145,0.97,770.97,775.741,"The other thing we were able to do at Oed was reach out to their landlord, which is a great partner of ours.",25,,
146,0.97,775.741,776.142,Plymouth housing.,25,,
147,0.97,776.142,781.046,Plymouth housing has pushed back rent for all of their small business tenants for a couple months.,25,,
148,0.97,781.046,789.088,That has been super helpful to folks like this family.,25,,
149,0.97,789.088,792.158,Here's a couple other examples of business owners that received the funds.,26,,
150,0.97,792.158,797.563,A cafe in South Lake Union.,26,,
151,0.97,797.563,802.902,And a DJ in Mccook.,26,,
152,0.97,802.902,805.171,You will see they both have amazing stories.,26,,
153,0.97,805.171,809.208,And are doing great work in the community.,26,,
154,0.97,809.208,818.017,"Next step, the Mayor is proposing an additional 1.5 million to be added to the fund.",27,,
155,0.97,818.017,823.889,"This will allow us to write up another hundred 50 business owners with $10,000 grants.",27,,
156,0.97,823.889,827.927,To help during this crisis.,27,,
157,0.97,827.927,831.397,The city has established a separate Fund also to accept private donations.,27,,
158,0.97,831.397,833.199,To support employee retention for small businesses.,27,,
159,0.97,833.199,843.342,The fund is funded by dollars which is meant to reach a targeted group of business owners.,27,,
160,0.97,843.342,847.346,A lot of them don't qualify.,27,,
161,0.97,847.346,855.554,They are using private donations that will allow us to support other businesses.,27,,
162,0.97,855.554,862.661,Oed is also currently developing an equity housing framework for future funding projects and programs.,27,,
163,0.97,862.661,872.171,"Despite all the efforts that were done to move as quickly as possible in support of all communities, we know that more can be done.",27,,
164,0.97,872.171,882.881,We want to make sure we are always applying equity to all of our projects.,27,,
165,0.97,882.881,892.258,"Finally, another lesson learned was we kind of have to--last year the pilot we had 200,000.",27,,
166,0.97,892.258,893.559,Now we have 2.5 million.,27,,
167,0.97,893.559,897.563,We have to scale very quickly.,27,,
168,0.97,897.563,909.575,"In future rounds, or future grant programs, we are working with a front to develop an Application/Data management system.",27,,
169,0.97,909.575,915.614,"Because even though we had a ton of human power, a ton of folks available to help us, there were a lot of things that could have been automated.",27,,
170,0.97,915.614,923.355,That would have made--would have sped up the process and allowed us to get this money out the door a little quicker.,27,,
171,0.97,923.355,929.528,But those were a couple big lessons learned I think.,27,,
172,0.97,929.528,933.499,"With that, is there any questions?",27,,
173,0.97,933.499,935.734,I was hoping to keep it under five minutes.,27,,
174,0.97,935.734,939.204,I know it is a packed schedule.,27,,
175,0.97,939.204,946.312,"Colleagues, any questions for Pedro?",28,,
176,0.97,946.312,950.149,Any comments?,28,,
177,0.97,950.149,951.951,All right.,28,,
178,0.97,951.951,955.454,"Thank you, Pager, so much.",28,,
179,0.97,955.454,957.222,I please have one question.,29,,
180,0.97,957.222,961.36,The floor is yours.,30,,
181,0.97,961.36,963.762,Thank you so much for this presentation.,31,,
182,0.97,963.762,970.869,I have talked to a number of the businesses in district 7 who have been recipients of this support.,31,,
183,0.97,970.869,975.341,It is just so overwhelmingly appreciated.,31,,
184,0.97,975.341,977.543,In a time when other sources of relief are slower coming.,31,,
185,0.97,977.543,981.847,Or not coming at all.,31,,
186,0.97,981.847,985.284,The city has been able to act swiftly to get in there and provide this relief.,31,,
187,0.97,985.284,987.152,It's incredible and people are very grateful for it.,31,,
188,0.97,987.152,1010.509,"I did just want to ask, because one of the things that is sobering, is just that we have 6000 folks who applied, you know, even with the additional resources we are putting into this, we are only on track for about a 7% rate of providing businesses who qualify this relief.",31,,
189,0.97,1010.509,1032.731,"I was wondering, if there had been consideration, just because I've talked to a number of businesses who have indicated that if they were to receive relief in the amount of light $5000, or an amount less than $10,000, it would be enough for their specific needs.",31,,
190,0.97,1032.731,1034.199,In order to get through the crisis.,31,,
191,0.97,1034.199,1044.543,I wonder if there is potential scope for some of the new money to go to a reduced amount in order to stretch it out over a higher number of applicants potentially.,31,,
192,0.97,1044.543,1049.615,I wonder what possible limitations there would be there if it had been considered.,31,,
193,0.97,1049.615,1066.165,"I know that the solution should be getting more Federal money so that we can honor all of these requests, I think it is some of the best relief that we have been doing as a city.",31,,
194,0.97,1066.165,1069.234,I did want to throw out and see if that has been a consideration.,31,,
195,0.97,1069.234,1077.743,"I know there are some businesses were a $5000 grant could help them get through, and there might be a way to stretch the resources a little further giving the massing the band.",31,,
196,0.97,1077.743,1079.044,"Thank you, Councilmember.",32,,
197,0.97,1079.044,1081.246,That is a great question.,32,,
198,0.97,1081.246,1087.686,A question that we received many times.,32,,
199,0.97,1087.686,1091.19,"When we first launched this program, we were trying to figure out what is that magic number?",32,,
200,0.97,1091.19,1092.391,Or is there a magic number?,32,,
201,0.97,1092.391,1095.194,Can we instead just give folks what they applied for.,32,,
202,0.97,1095.194,1097.563,If they applied for three grand or five grand.,32,,
203,0.97,1097.563,1103.302,"Ultimately, we ended up landing on 10,000 for several reasons.",32,,
204,0.97,1103.302,1114.713,"One of those big reasons is that for a lot of small businesses, when you think about the average rent in Seattle, rent is between eight and $10,000.",32,,
205,0.97,1114.713,1124.723,"Because we didn't know how long this pandemic is going to go for, a lot of people were saying let's at least be able to provide small businesses with one month rent.",32,,
206,0.97,1124.723,1134.833,That's what we ended up sort of landing on because of what the average rent in Seattle is for a small business.,32,,
207,0.97,1134.833,1146.411,We also wanted to give business owners an amount that would allow them to help with wages.,32,,
208,0.97,1146.411,1149.915,For those that have five employees or less to also be able to pay their employees.,32,,
209,0.97,1149.915,1152.417,"So, for future rounds, we are considering that.",32,,
210,0.97,1152.417,1156.154,We didn't necessarily have the data to show what the perfect amount is.,32,,
211,0.97,1156.154,1159.258,Not that there is one.,32,,
212,0.97,1159.258,1165.931,I'm sure you'll hear later about the economic impact study that we conducted.,32,,
213,0.97,1165.931,1174.84,"I think that's going to tell us a lot more about the story, the need, and will help shape future programs.",32,,
214,0.97,1174.84,1179.678,"Thank you, Pedro for the additional information.",33,,
215,0.97,1179.678,1180.879,And Councilmember Lewis for that question.,33,,
216,0.97,1180.879,1188.053,Are there any other additional questions or comments?,33,,
217,0.97,1188.053,1189.655,I see Councilmember Herbold has raised her hand.,33,,
218,0.97,1189.655,1196.895,"Thank you, I really appreciate the efforts of the office of economic development particularly as it relates to this particular Fund.",34,,
219,0.97,1196.895,1210.609,The concern I'm hearing most from constituents who are small business owners is their frustration around the Ppp program.,34,,
220,0.97,1210.609,1212.11,Administered by the Federal Government.,34,,
221,0.97,1212.11,1241.44,"I'm just wondering, is the office of economic development, I know it might feel like a exercise in futility given what we know now about that program, but I'm just wondering, is Oed offering any technical assistance? What best advice do you have for small business owners who are trying to access that fund?",34,,
222,0.97,1241.44,1244.943,"Given that it, with last week's congressional action has been replenished.",34,,
223,0.97,1244.943,1263.462,"And then, the last pieces I'm wondering, part of the Federal, Federal package was $60 billion for Cdf I, and credit--I'm losing the--losing the term.",34,,
224,0.97,1263.462,1265.864,Not a bank but a credit Union.,34,,
225,0.97,1265.864,1281.079,"I'm wondering what you can tell me about how those dollars are going to be dispersed, both to local credit unions and CFI's, and out to businesses, thank you.",34,,
226,0.97,1281.079,1284.983,This is Bobby Lee.,35,,
227,0.97,1284.983,1285.784,Can you all hear me?,35,,
228,0.97,1285.784,1290.589,We can hear you.,36,,
229,0.97,1290.589,1291.39,"Okay, great, thank you.",37,,
230,0.97,1291.39,1292.391,I'll keep my comments short.,37,,
231,0.97,1292.391,1293.892,I know you have a long agenda.,37,,
232,0.97,1293.892,1303.001,At Oed we have a 15 person team that answers the phones from those who have questions about the SBA loan.,37,,
233,0.97,1303.001,1303.468,And grant products.,37,,
234,0.97,1303.468,1310.308,We have also been working with other companies to make sure we have language access capacity as well.,37,,
235,0.97,1310.308,1317.282,We have our team on standby right now to answer phone calls.,37,,
236,0.97,1317.282,1321.92,We have had that team up and running for a little while now.,37,,
237,0.97,1321.92,1326.525,"With the new vote by Congress, we know the phones are going to start bringing.",37,,
238,0.97,1326.525,1333.031,We have a team that is ready to go to provide technical assistance.,37,,
239,0.97,1333.031,1337.536,The second part is we also provide technical assistance to neighborhood economic development groups and business districts.,37,,
240,0.97,1337.536,1346.144,Through our OEM Seattle program we have a Proactive team that is working to educate our partners around how to help small business around TA.,37,,
241,0.97,1346.144,1359.558,The last part is this is a really exciting time where we can now start to use our own Cdf I agencies who specialize in SBA loan and grant program to get capital so they can provide the loans particularly to our Underservedcommunities.,37,,
242,0.97,1359.558,1364.73,This is a new endeavor that is backed by SBA.,37,,
243,0.97,1364.73,1370.836,We will front some money hopefully at the city level but eventually we will get paid back by the Federal Government.,37,,
244,0.97,1370.836,1373.472,This is an area we are looking into.,37,,
245,0.97,1373.472,1376.742,We hope you have a program up and running pretty soon.,37,,
246,0.97,1376.742,1381.179,That's great to hear.,38,,
247,0.97,1381.179,1383.648,"That's good to hear, thank you director Lee.",38,,
248,0.97,1383.648,1384.116,It is 9:55.,38,,
249,0.97,1384.116,1386.084,I definitely don't want to cut the next presenter short.,38,,
250,0.97,1386.084,1396.027,We are going to move to Beto Yarce from ventures who is going to walk us through his presentation.,38,,

263,0.97,1444.543,1446.044,We are in Micro lender.,41,,
264,0.97,1446.044,1460.058,"I am excited that the presentation started from Pedro, and the great question from Councilmember Herbold about how we can do more work with Cdfi and how we can collaborate this work.",41,,
265,0.97,1460.058,1466.264,Really the work we've been doing for 25 years is in low income areas.,41,,
266,0.97,1466.264,1474.639,To basically help them through Micro enterprise and Micro lending to move out of poverty.,41,,
267,0.97,1474.639,1481.546,"The five values are community, client success, empowerment, integrity, diversity and integration.",41,,
268,0.97,1481.546,1485.05,That's exactly how we do things every day adventures.,41,,
269,0.97,1485.05,1487.853,These are a little bit of our numbers of who do we serve.,41,,
270,0.97,1487.853,1490.288,That way you guys have a better idea.,41,,
271,0.97,1490.288,1494.759,Many of you have worked and collaborated with ventures over the year.,41,,
272,0.97,1494.759,1504.569,"But, when I say cover in 2014 as the Ceo, I Rebranded and changed everything through ventures.",41,,
273,0.97,1504.569,1507.706,We serve about 600 individuals per year.,41,,
274,0.97,1507.706,1512.611,"Average clients are for a family of $24,000.",41,,
275,0.97,1512.611,1516.114,We have expanded a little bit on this now.,41,,
276,0.97,1516.114,1520.785,We just received a Federal grant that allowed us to expand.,41,,
277,0.97,1520.785,1527.626,"Even with Covid-19, we are moving forward and we are expanding into Snohomish County.",41,,
278,0.97,1527.626,1530.128,75% of our clients are women.,41,,
279,0.97,1530.128,1533.331,65% are people of color.,41,,
280,0.97,1533.331,1535.4,35% are immigrants and refugees.,41,,
281,0.97,1535.4,1538.003,3% are Spanish speakers.,41,,
282,0.97,1538.003,1542.707,This is a part that I'm very proud of I am the founder of the Latin mix program.,41,,
283,0.97,1542.707,1548.547,That's how I started working with ventures when I had my own businesses.,41,,
284,0.97,1548.547,1550.615,That is my background.,41,,
285,0.97,1550.615,1557.055,I have a lot of small business Entrepreneurship in my blood.,41,,
286,0.97,1557.055,1561.359,I decided to found this program from English to Spanish to serve our Latino community.,41,,
287,0.97,1561.359,1569.167,"We have been serving for more than 10 years, and we have served more than 1000 entrepreneurs in the Latin community.",41,,
288,0.97,1569.167,1572.27,I'm very proud of.,41,,
289,0.97,1572.27,1575.24,We do everything in English and everything in Spanish.,41,,
290,0.97,1575.24,1578.843,So all of our questions are in English and in Spanish.,41,,
291,0.97,1578.843,1586.384,"So, this is a little bit of a mural.",41,,
292,0.97,1586.384,1589.587,I am trying to go as fast as possible just to be respectful of the time.,41,,
293,0.97,1589.587,1595.894,This is exactly how our model works.,41,,
294,0.97,1595.894,1610.375,The reason that our model is very successful in low income individuals and Underserved population is because we have created our own--we've utilized a lot of the data that things how have they been working.,41,,
295,0.97,1610.375,1612.01,How do we meet people where they are?,41,,
296,0.97,1612.01,1616.014,Especially when these people have been Underserved.,41,,
297,0.97,1616.014,1620.085,"So, that is something that brings me a lot of joy to kind of like have the privilege I have.",41,,
298,0.97,1620.085,1625.724,"I always share a little bit of I learned break even point, that is a huge component.",41,,
299,0.97,1625.724,1632.13,I learned that when I was eight because my mom taught me that with a box of chocolate.,41,,
300,0.97,1632.13,1633.231,That is privilege.,41,,
301,0.97,1633.231,1637.435,I learned that when I was a young kid.,41,,
302,0.97,1637.435,1641.539,With my first business which was selling candy.,41,,
303,0.97,1641.539,1648.513,"So, I always share that because it is that that changed the way that I think.",41,,
304,0.97,1648.513,1651.75,Many of the populations we think don't have that.,41,,
305,0.97,1651.75,1653.818,That's why we created this model.,41,,
306,0.97,1653.818,1658.656,"We started with the center, which is an eight week program.",41,,
307,0.97,1658.656,1661.526,Basically you complete a business plan.,41,,
308,0.97,1661.526,1668.666,"After that you have access to the whole network, which is courses, coaching, capital incubation, and then it is Non- stopping.",41,,
309,0.97,1668.666,1671.67,It is always ongoing.,41,,
310,0.97,1671.67,1673.772,These communities need these.,41,,
311,0.97,1673.772,1674.939,You see capital on the bottom.,41,,
312,0.97,1674.939,1686.384,Capital is what we have done in the 25 years . that is not the only thing that is important for all these businesses.,41,,
313,0.97,1686.384,1693.291,They need their only voice . I make it funny that access to capital is the solution.,41,,
314,0.97,1693.291,1699.764,Is not really . It's technical assistance especially if you don't know how to learn a business.,41,,
315,0.97,1699.764,1711.71,"In two years of the business basic course, people were out of poverty, 40% of our entrepreneurs got public assistance.",41,,
316,0.97,1711.71,1713.611,All this data is keep track and is transparency.,41,,
317,0.97,1713.611,1724.022,"We have to provide all of this through the funds that we received, Federal grants, Cdfi, so this money has to be proved.",41,,
318,0.97,1724.022,1729.127,The transparency of our data has to be existing.,41,,
319,0.97,1729.127,1731.629,So that we have an audit every year.,41,,
320,0.97,1731.629,1735.433,We need to make sure all this information is true.,41,,
321,0.97,1735.433,1740.939,Business provide 80% of business are still in operation and business revenue increase by 28%.,41,,
322,0.97,1740.939,1744.409,About $500Per month.,41,,
323,0.97,1744.409,1745.844,Businesses create jobs in their community.,41,,
324,0.97,1745.844,1747.011,That's another thing.,41,,
325,0.97,1747.011,1753.518,"A lot of people think they generate jobs, and they do.",41,,
326,0.97,1753.518,1758.423,I always like to talk about how many of the populations we serve are generating jobs.,41,,
327,0.97,1758.423,1769.033,Right now it is a big crisis because Micro Enterprises definitely employ a lot of people.,41,,
328,0.97,1769.033,1770.869,I also like to talk about Micro small business.,41,,
329,0.97,1770.869,1775.073,We always generalize this Micro small business.,41,,
330,0.97,1775.073,1776.975,This is a land where we are an expert.,41,,
331,0.97,1776.975,1779.944,It is from 1 to 5 employees.,41,,
332,0.97,1779.944,1782.18,They are the most vulnerable.,41,,
333,0.97,1782.18,1786.651,"They are facing foreclosure, going out of businesses, and even homelessness.",41,,
334,0.97,1786.651,1797.195,"We have had businesses in our history that people who have been homeless, they come to our programs and they move out of the homelessness.",41,,
335,0.97,1797.195,1805.37,"Right now I'm very worried about so many of our client, they are facing challenges.",41,,
336,0.97,1805.37,1806.104,They are also workers.,41,,
337,0.97,1806.104,1809.807,Some of them have full-time jobs and they are also facing the challenge of losing their business.,41,,
338,0.97,1809.807,1812.11,I will talk a little bit more about that.,41,,
339,0.97,1812.11,1814.312,Efficiency.,41,,
340,0.97,1814.312,1819.117,To those lacking liquidity on financial crisis.,41,,
341,0.97,1819.117,1823.221,We need to move as fast as possible.,41,,
342,0.97,1823.221,1828.126,"I send a Blog, I don't know if you had an opportunity to read that Blog, that is on the bottom of this presentation.",41,,
343,0.97,1828.126,1835.2,That's the way that we are responding . in a week we were able to distribute more than 60 grants.,41,,
344,0.97,1835.2,1839.304,Because we do have relationships with our friends.,41,,
345,0.97,1839.304,1843.508,That is something that our friends were very excited about.,41,,
346,0.97,1843.508,1854.452,"Something that we always think about the solution is money, strategy, technical assistance, coaching, access to markets, and then where are people Impacting the community?",41,,
347,0.97,1854.452,1857.322,We need to create a crisis strategy.,41,,
348,0.97,1857.322,1865.263,"Some question that I received from you guys, through Councilmember Morales.",41,,
349,0.97,1865.263,1876.074,"I always forget to use the more formal--so, how are the Federal programs working for Micro small businesses and small businesses?",41,,
350,0.97,1876.074,1877.475,What are the challenges for the programs?,41,,
351,0.97,1877.475,1879.744,They are not working.,41,,
352,0.97,1879.744,1881.279,The money is not being distributed.,41,,
353,0.97,1881.279,1886.284,The money was distributed to big banks first.,41,,
354,0.97,1886.284,1888.953,It was a lot of confusion and not enough funding.,41,,
355,0.97,1888.953,1896.894,They were not prepared to support companies.,41,,
356,0.97,1896.894,1898.896,We know all that.,41,,
357,0.97,1898.896,1906.704,"So, with the ventures experience another word we have been doing is the SBA lender.",41,,
358,0.97,1906.704,1909.107,We couldn't deploy the money faster.,41,,
359,0.97,1909.107,1911.91,That's what I'm excited with the second run.,41,,
360,0.97,1911.91,1913.444,We are exploring on working on that.,41,,
361,0.97,1913.444,1919.884,We did our own Ppp program.,41,,
362,0.97,1919.884,1922.587,The reason that we did it is because we work with a small bank.,41,,
363,0.97,1922.587,1927.191,We know have to navigate the system.,41,,
364,0.97,1927.191,1929.827,My associate director Laura Fletcher is amazing and she knows how to do it.,41,,
365,0.97,1929.827,1934.332,One of my board members is a BP at Columbia bank.,41,,
366,0.97,1934.332,1938.803,"We have information, we have access to information.",41,,
367,0.97,1938.803,1947.345,"So, another question is what are the major issues for Micro small business in the next 12 months, I call it creative capital.",41,,
368,0.97,1947.345,1949.447,A combination of grants and emergency loans.,41,,
369,0.97,1949.447,1956.054,Small businesses need financial support to be able to recover from the crisis.,41,,
370,0.97,1956.054,1965.229,"This is not where we are asking for free money or grants, this is investing in our community.",41,,
371,0.97,1965.229,1966.597,"People of color, immigrants, refugees, most Underserved.",41,,
372,0.97,1966.597,1971.736,"If not they are going to be erased, and all this work we have been doing for 25 years is going to be erased.",41,,
373,0.97,1971.736,1974.772,We are going to have to start all over again.,41,,
374,0.97,1974.772,1975.573,I am not exaggerating.,41,,
375,0.97,1975.573,1977.742,I am just seeing that it is happening.,41,,
376,0.97,1977.742,1984.082,"Again, I know the city is facing a lot of challenges and crisis on budgets.",41,,
377,0.97,1984.082,1993.791,We need to figure out how do we create a reduction of business that are able to reopen again.,41,,
378,0.97,1993.791,1997.195,Access to technical assistance and for support to help business get back to normal.,41,,
379,0.97,1997.195,1999.097,I hear that from Oed.,41,,
380,0.97,1999.097,2002.2,I know they are doing work on that.,41,,
381,0.97,2002.2,2002.8,Business coaching.,41,,
382,0.97,2002.8,2011.109,And Mentorship to help businesses recover people in business.,41,,
383,0.97,2011.109,2014.379,Small business owners are entrepreneurial.,41,,
384,0.97,2014.379,2017.382,Some will figure out there on.,41,,
385,0.97,2017.382,2019.217,Think about the ones that don't have economic opportunities.,41,,
386,0.97,2019.217,2023.888,We need to step up for them.,41,,
387,0.97,2023.888,2032.096,"So, I feel like this is a question that is like how do we are going to be able to help our workers as an organization.",41,,
388,0.97,2032.096,2035.5,We are having an impact.,41,,
389,0.97,2035.5,2038.503,We have a ventures marketplace.,41,,
390,0.97,2038.503,2044.442,In the first week of Covid-19 we have to lay off six individuals who are our retail Associates.,41,,
391,0.97,2044.442,2047.211,"It was very, very hard.",41,,
392,0.97,2047.211,2049.247,We help them to navigate the system on unemployment.,41,,
393,0.97,2049.247,2051.549,It was very challenging.,41,,
394,0.97,2051.549,2053.951,That's what I see with a lot of small businesses.,41,,
395,0.97,2053.951,2062.059,"So, I hear employees frustration.",41,,
396,0.97,2062.059,2062.894,Hard to navigate the systems.,41,,
397,0.97,2062.894,2064.495,It was not technical assistance.,41,,
398,0.97,2064.495,2066.664,People don't know how to apply for unemployment.,41,,
399,0.97,2066.664,2073.538,"They apply, they do it wrong, they don't get their money.",41,,
400,0.97,2073.538,2074.872,How do we compensate for that?,41,,
401,0.97,2074.872,2077.475,I will end with some of our clients have their of the jobs.,41,,
402,0.97,2077.475,2081.646,Putting them in the severe financial crisis.,41,,
403,0.97,2081.646,2083.881,One of the grants we are giving is only $500 per grant.,41,,
404,0.97,2083.881,2087.051,That was our magic number.,41,,
405,0.97,2087.051,2089.954,Of $500 helped many of our clients to complete the rent of the month.,41,,
406,0.97,2089.954,2092.557,They also were buying groceries.,41,,
407,0.97,2092.557,2102.7,"We were a little bit more open at this time basically when we do grants or funds, we only encourage our clients to use them only for business.",41,,
408,0.97,2102.7,2105.803,In this case we were more flexible because we see the emergency.,41,,
409,0.97,2105.803,2110.808,"So, I will end with that.",41,,
410,0.97,2110.808,2112.61,I want to be respectful of the time.,41,,
411,0.97,2112.61,2118.749,"I really encourage you to read the Blog if you have, and that way you can see how we are responding to this as an organization.",41,,

415,0.97,2129.527,2135.032,They are absolutely critical to helping the smallest of small businesses.,42,,
416,0.97,2135.032,2138.503,Navigate this tricky environment right now.,42,,
417,0.97,2138.503,2146.611,"So, really appreciate all of the good work that you are continuing to do.",42,,

422,0.97,2160.024,2169.367,Any questions or comments for Beto from my college before we moved to our final presentation on this section?,42,,
423,0.97,2169.367,2173.17,"If you're raising your hands, I can't see you.",42,,
424,0.97,2173.17,2177.074,"So, you might need to speak up.",42,,

426,0.97,2179.677,2182.78,I came not seeing anybody.,42,,
427,0.97,2182.78,2188.452,"We are going to go ahead and move, thank you, Beto.",42,,
428,0.97,2188.452,2196.394,"We are going to go ahead and move--you don't have a question you were just saying hello, got it.",43,,
429,0.97,2196.394,2200.798,"Okay, we are going to go ahead and move to our final presenter in this.",43,,
430,0.97,2200.798,2210.208,Which is to hear from Marie Kurose who is from the workforce development Council of Seattle and King County.,43,,
431,0.97,2210.208,2214.612,Who is going to talk to us about the very important issue of workforce development.,43,,

434,0.97,2231.896,2233.13,I don't want to forget that.,44,,

438,0.97,2254.619,2259.724,Let's go ahead and move to the last presenter for this section.,46,,
439,0.97,2259.724,2261.158,Marie are you on the line?,46,,

446,0.97,2270.868,2273.571,I am fairly new to the workforce development Council.,49,,
447,0.97,2273.571,2287.985,Joined nine months ago as the Ceo to leave the organization to really transform--I'm supposed to start my Video I guess.,49,,
448,0.97,2287.985,2289.754,There is no Video to start.,50,,
449,0.97,2289.754,2298.195,"Anyways, so my focus is really on how do we look at building an inclusive workforce?",51,,
450,0.97,2298.195,2304.201,We are focusing on Scaling out career pathways.,51,,
451,0.97,2304.201,2306.003,Especially on disparity.,51,,
452,0.97,2306.003,2313.177,The last two months have been flipping our focus.,51,,
453,0.97,2313.177,2318.816,"But still in terms of the issues around disparity, it is more important that we do that.",51,,
454,0.97,2318.816,2327.625,"I have tried to provide some information, as all of you know, this has been unprecedented.",51,,
455,0.97,2327.625,2330.695,It has been a tsunami coming into this.,51,,
456,0.97,2330.695,2334.098,Especially in the workforce and development and business field.,51,,
457,0.97,2334.098,2336.3,Try to just track and keep up with all the constant change.,51,,
458,0.97,2336.3,2340.137,I forgot I'm supposed to--Oh.,51,,
459,0.97,2340.137,2346.444,This is my first time actually doing the presentation myself.,51,,
460,0.97,2346.444,2348.746,[Laughter] no worries.,52,,
461,0.97,2348.746,2350.548,You are doing great.,52,,
462,0.97,2350.548,2360.257,We have all appreciated the need to be patient with each other as we are all figuring out and experiencing our own learning curve with how to do this remotely.,52,,
463,0.97,2360.257,2360.858,No worries.,52,,
464,0.97,2360.858,2366.764,"[Laughter] so, as you all know, this is just been unprecedented.",53,,
465,0.97,2366.764,2373.07,The last few months have just been really wild.,53,,
466,0.97,2373.07,2377.174,This has also been very different.,53,,
467,0.97,2377.174,2382.38,It is Multifaceted in terms of our response.,53,,
468,0.97,2382.38,2390.521,We have to stretch outside of our just narrow kind of focus often times and really think about kind of the related Ecosystem and the impacts.,53,,
469,0.97,2390.521,2397.094,"And of course, we are seeing the disproportionate in cat.",53,,
470,0.97,2397.094,2407.004,"If ever, this has been racial and economic inequities have been amplified with this.",53,,
471,0.97,2407.004,2408.806,The depth and duration we just don't know.,53,,
472,0.97,2408.806,2411.675,There's a lot of uncertainty.,53,,
473,0.97,2411.675,2412.209,Overview.,53,,
474,0.97,2412.209,2424.088,"Just to give you a vision of kind of what this pace and scale has been, this has been just one month time.",53,,
475,0.97,2424.088,2427.925,You see our unemployment rate went from 2.4% to 5.4%.,53,,
476,0.97,2427.925,2429.527,It continues to rise.,53,,
477,0.97,2429.527,2438.269,"You look down, compared to other years this has been unprecedented.",53,,
478,0.97,2438.269,2449.914,"Also, you'll see that the new unemployment claims just from the beginning of March through April 18th, you see the spike.",53,,
479,0.97,2449.914,2456.954,"And you'll see how it started early on with, the March, with the social distancing.",53,,
480,0.97,2456.954,2460.024,"Kind of, mandates.",53,,
481,0.97,2460.024,2468.899,And the next slide you will see the impact--I'll talk a little bit more about kind of what sectors are being impacted.,53,,
482,0.97,2468.899,2473.537,"So, overall, we have seen that ever sector has been impacted.",53,,
483,0.97,2473.537,2485.85,Although the vulnerability and economic impact will very . for many sectors that are laying off their--many of their workers are still able to Telecommute.,53,,
484,0.97,2485.85,2488.552,We are fortunate that we are able to Telecommute in this environment.,53,,
485,0.97,2488.552,2489.987,Many people don't have that benefit.,53,,
486,0.97,2489.987,2500.364,We are also seeing that the retail hospitality restaurant sectors have been disproportionately impacted.,53,,
487,0.97,2500.364,2511.775,"Within those sectors, we have a large percentage of low-wage workers, people of color, immigrants, and refugees.",53,,
488,0.97,2511.775,2519.183,"Some of the data also shows, and we don't have the exact data yet, but some of this is based on some other analysis.",53,,
489,0.97,2519.183,2524.822,"Small business in these sectors in Kings County, 86%.",53,,
490,0.97,2524.822,2527.024,The businesses in the sector.,53,,
491,0.97,2527.024,2534.798,"We are also seeing as many of you know, there is this huge demand for essential jobs workers.",53,,
492,0.97,2534.798,2539.837,"Grocery stores, delivery, Healthcare.",53,,
493,0.97,2539.837,2547.745,"I just want to also say that going into those jobs, how do we do that with this I to personal safety?",53,,
494,0.97,2547.745,2553.851,"Early on, the Chamber of Commerce had produced a report.",53,,
495,0.97,2553.851,2561.959,They had done an analogous that really showed an estimated the number of workers that were at risk in King County.,53,,
496,0.97,2561.959,2565.863,They showed the immediate risk being 419.,53,,
497,0.97,2565.863,2574.371,"But the immediate and Shorter- term, over 600,000 workers in King County at risk.",53,,
498,0.97,2574.371,2581.545,Most of those occupations are those low a paying occupations.,53,,
499,0.97,2581.545,2588.786,"So, this screen just really shows kind of wild there has been some broad impact.",53,,
500,0.97,2588.786,2593.59,I only pulled up the sectors that had 5000 or more unemployment applicants.,53,,
501,0.97,2593.59,2605.669,"You'll see that accommodations and food services, Healthcare and social services, and retail were some of the top.",53,,
502,0.97,2605.669,2610.107,"Others that you see are the manufacturing, some of those jobs as you know will be coming back.",53,,
503,0.97,2610.107,2612.109,And this will be just temporary.,53,,
504,0.97,2612.109,2631.762,"The primary sectors that have been--that have had the longest shutdown Induration have been in the accommodation food services, and retail industries.",53,,
505,0.97,2633.597,2634.932,Okay.,53,,
506,0.97,2634.932,2645.843,"So, this graphic, and Councilmember Morales had asked for some really specific information on kind of impact in the city.",53,,
507,0.97,2645.843,2653.484,"I have requested from the state, the state has all of the unemployment data, insurance data.",53,,
508,0.97,2653.484,2658.422,I have been requesting additional data just in terms of demographics by industry.,53,,
509,0.97,2658.422,2660.657,But also by geography.,53,,
510,0.97,2660.657,2672.469,"Not yet received that, however, urban Institute has done some analysis based on Census and some of the UIS.",53,,
511,0.97,2672.469,2678.375,Unemployment and low risk standards data.,53,,
512,0.97,2678.375,2686.583,"The projections they have made, and they have shown for neighborhoods that are hardest hit by Covid-19 in terms of workers, and low income jobs.",53,,
513,0.97,2686.583,2688.986,You see here.,53,,
514,0.97,2688.986,2697.294,"This graphic, and in Southeast Seattle, it is amongst one of the highest impacted communities.",53,,
515,0.97,2697.294,2701.298,"The darker blue, the blue, the highest impact.",53,,
516,0.97,2701.298,2709.206,"We will have, I was told that I would get the data on zip code last week.",53,,
517,0.97,2709.206,2713.31,I am here now it is going to be this week.,53,,
518,0.97,2713.31,2716.713,I will have a better sense of what that data is and I'll provide some updates.,53,,
519,0.97,2716.713,2722.886,When we receive it.,53,,
520,0.97,2722.886,2738.135,"As you know, as many of you know, this minority owned businesses, women and minority owned businesses are amongst the hardest hit because of the prevalence in these industries.",53,,
521,0.97,2738.135,2741.739,But also focusing on some of the Pre-Existing Schenectady's.,53,,
522,0.97,2741.739,2768.365,"Lack of access to capital, less capital to cushion the ongoing operations, and in terms of small employees of these small businesses, because these businesses don't have that capital they are unable to continue to pay wages or benefits for those employees.",53,,
523,0.97,2769.6,2777.341,"So, I'm just going to quickly just go into kind of recovery.",53,,
524,0.97,2777.341,2787.384,We know this is unlike any recession or economic thing we have seen before.,53,,
525,0.97,2787.384,2790.587,I think it's really important for us not to jump to kind of a conclusion.,53,,
526,0.97,2790.587,2796.393,But to really be coordinating and communicating and looking at data.,53,,
527,0.97,2796.393,2800.097,We are kind of developing a recovery this.,53,,
528,0.97,2800.097,2811.809,"In terms of structure and priorities, although workforce development Council operates the network that work source centers.",53,,
529,0.97,2811.809,2813.544,That brings a lot of partners together.,53,,
530,0.97,2813.544,2815.379,Our biggest demand has really been around unemployment insurance.,53,,
531,0.97,2815.379,2819.383,"People having questions about, not being able to access unemployment insurance.",53,,
532,0.97,2819.383,2821.318,That is a function of the state.,53,,
533,0.97,2821.318,2833.797,"Actually by law, and so we have been really working and advocating with the state to get, Partnerwith us and our community agencies.",53,,
534,0.97,2833.797,2835.833,First of all to translate the materials.,53,,
535,0.97,2835.833,2841.305,In multiple languages.,53,,
536,0.97,2841.305,2842.94,Finally got their agreement to do that last week.,53,,
537,0.97,2842.94,2846.41,For some of the main documents.,53,,
538,0.97,2846.41,2848.645,We have also gotten approval in some of our community partners.,53,,
539,0.97,2848.645,2857.254,"Asian Council and referral, and others are translating some of the documents on how to apply for unemployment.",53,,
540,0.97,2857.254,2864.461,They are getting training and some of them are now able to answer some of the lines.,53,,
541,0.97,2864.461,2869.533,"They cannot actually do the eligibility, but they are answering some of the help lines now.",53,,
542,0.97,2869.533,2877.541,We have brought a team of Multilingual case managers from our communities to get trained.,53,,
543,0.97,2877.541,2879.943,They'll be answering the phones starting this week I believe.,53,,
544,0.97,2879.943,2885.549,"So, that has been kind of top priority as that has been a need.",53,,
545,0.97,2885.549,2891.021,It's also looking at how do we make sure that we are improving access to all of the other supports?,53,,
546,0.97,2891.021,2893.891,Technology is a huge gap.,53,,
547,0.97,2893.891,2902.599,"It is looking at strengthening the safety net, both of public benefits, as well is kind of the other philanthropic and other efforts going on.",53,,
548,0.97,2902.599,2908.405,Right now there is a lot of chaos.,53,,
549,0.97,2908.405,2911.909,I think the strength of our community is a lot of people are ready to help.,53,,
550,0.97,2911.909,2922.085,"The challenge is for people in the community that are trying to access a variety of support, that's very chaotic.",53,,
551,0.97,2922.085,2926.423,We are really working across sectors to try to support community navigators.,53,,
552,0.97,2926.423,2938.302,"That are working to help their workers, impacted workers, and other community members with kind of the range of supports needed.",53,,
553,0.97,2938.302,2945.542,"Again, being asked to help employers fill those jobs for the essential jobs.",53,,
554,0.97,2945.542,2962.359,"I think it's important that we are helping connect workers to those jobs, but also working to make sure that those employees are implementing some safety standards for the workers.",53,,
555,0.97,2962.359,2968.665,"And we continue to advocate for and leverage kind of local, state, and Federal funding.",53,,
556,0.97,2968.665,2978.976,"While decisions are being made at a fast and various pace, oftentimes the voices of those that are being impacted are not included.",53,,
557,0.97,2978.976,2980.043,I think it's important for us.,53,,
558,0.97,2980.043,2988.385,I really appreciate Councilmember Morales.,53,,
559,0.97,2988.385,2989.453,Bringing multiple voices to the table.,53,,
560,0.97,2989.453,2996.093,Some of these applications have gone three days noticed and with very little input.,53,,
561,0.97,2996.093,3004.801,It's important for us to look at that data so that we can really understand and target resources to Prioritize those resources.,53,,
562,0.97,3004.801,3017.581,"And also recognizing that a lot of the Federal programs have limited, or excluded many of the immigrant workers.",53,,
563,0.97,3017.581,3030.193,"As we start moving towards recovery, going back to that data, making sure that we are targeting our assistance and supporting those that are most vulnerable.",53,,
564,0.97,3030.193,3043.24,"As we are moving to prepare workers for success, one of the Isues that before Covid, businesses were--there was this labor shortage.",53,,
565,0.97,3043.24,3045.842,They were having problems finding workers with the skills.,53,,
566,0.97,3045.842,3055.152,I think it's important for us to start building in opportunities to build the skills of low-wage workers but also improve job quality as we move forward.,53,,
567,0.97,3055.152,3068.765,"And looking at opportunities to leverage some of the Federal dollars, subsidized wages for some of the small businesses to bring back there workers, but also support some of the job Skilling.",53,,
568,0.97,3068.765,3080.177,"In the future, we learn from the recession, that Postrecession, disparities widen.",53,,
569,0.97,3080.177,3086.883,I think there's an opportunity for us to think about a recovery in a way that we focus on job quality and moving forward.,53,,
570,0.97,3086.883,3091.288,And then also just really saying that we need to help our workers get through this.,53,,
571,0.97,3091.288,3103.099,And return to work and reduce this duration of unemployment before it gets too deep.,53,,
572,0.97,3103.099,3104.968,"So, I think that's about it.",53,,
573,0.97,3104.968,3110.707,I will bring additional data I think that data is really important.,53,,
574,0.97,3110.707,3111.808,Hopefully in the next week.,53,,
575,0.97,3111.808,3117.28,"Thank you, Marie for that presentation.",54,,
576,0.97,3117.28,3118.348,Really rich with information.,54,,
577,0.97,3118.348,3125.822,Certainly painting a sober picture for Seattle King County as it relates to this particular issue.,54,,
578,0.97,3125.822,3127.691,Appreciate you being with us this morning.,54,,
579,0.97,3127.691,3141.471,Any questions or comments folks for Marie or for any of the other Presenters as we close out this portion of the presentation?,54,,
580,0.97,3141.471,3146.61,"So Councilmember Morales, I know that you have raised your hand.",54,,
581,0.97,3146.61,3148.945,I'd love to have you close us out if that is okay.,54,,
582,0.97,3148.945,3156.152,"Okay, so I'm going to go over to Councilmember Mosqueda who raised her hand.",54,,
583,0.97,3156.152,3157.354,"Thank you, Council President.",55,,
584,0.97,3157.354,3159.723,Thank you so much for the presentation from the workforce development Council.,55,,
585,0.97,3159.723,3161.758,This is something that we've been thinking about a lot.,55,,
586,0.97,3161.758,3167.063,You mentioned the lessons learned from the past recession.,55,,
587,0.97,3167.063,3169.566,I'd like to draw that out a little bit more.,55,,
588,0.97,3169.566,3175.338,"I thing one thing that's important for us to remember from the last recession is that the number of manufacturing jobs lost, was never recovered.",55,,
589,0.97,3175.338,3179.976,Many of those jobs went to the service sector.,55,,
590,0.97,3179.976,3188.285,"Now, when we look at your chart in terms of who is affected, and we see it disproportionately affecting folks in the service spectrum, we know those to be mostly women and people of color.",55,,
591,0.97,3188.285,3190.287,Let's not forget these essential workers are making the Minium wage.,55,,
592,0.97,3190.287,3194.958,If not just slightly more.,55,,
593,0.97,3194.958,3196.56,Which is not a living wage in Seattle.,55,,
594,0.97,3196.56,3201.498,I guess I'd love to hear a little bit more about what type strategies workforce development Council is think about.,55,,
595,0.97,3201.498,3206.303,Either locally or nationally.,55,,
596,0.97,3206.303,3213.176,We have been involved in a handful of conversations with folks at the national level about the need to sort of rethink what workforce development actually means.,55,,
597,0.97,3213.176,3227.691,"In the past, when I worked at the Washington state label Council, I think one of our biggest criticisms was that often workforce development was how do we challenge individuals or workers into whatever industry sort of was the loudest.",55,,
598,0.97,3227.691,3229.826,And most demanding.,55,,
599,0.97,3229.826,3231.261,That wasn't necessarily high- quality jobs.,55,,
600,0.97,3231.261,3246.843,"That met not thinking about how do you prepare workers for Self- determination, and stability, but in fact how do we train X number of people because fill in the blank industry has asked for 100 or 300 people.",55,,
601,0.97,3246.843,3255.819,"You mentioned lessons learned come and you mentioned quality jobs and returning to work, but it just doesn't seem like we shouldn't, return to the status quo.",55,,
602,0.97,3255.819,3262.359,Can you talk a little bit more about what it means to train workers in a Post-Covid world?,55,,
603,0.97,3262.359,3273.803,Where we see essential work being defined so explicitly around the very folks that have been put into the lowest wage workers?,55,,
604,0.97,3273.803,3282.278,"And putting into context, Trump saying we are going to reduce wages for Farmworkers.",55,,
605,0.97,3282.278,3285.081,As that is some sort of way to show how essential that work is.,55,,
606,0.97,3285.081,3291.855,Anything you can tell us about how we are trying to rethink what workforce development actually is in a Post-Covid world would be excellent.,55,,
607,0.97,3291.855,3294.658,Thank you.,56,,
608,0.97,3294.658,3300.363,"It is not the common thinking of workforce development, you are right.",56,,
609,0.97,3300.363,3302.399,"So, we are thinking out of the box.",56,,
610,0.97,3302.399,3311.708,Working with some of our label partners and some of the National partners to really identify opportunities to bring in top-quality.,56,,
611,0.97,3311.708,3320.817,One of the keys is we are all now seeing the importance of these essential critical workers.,56,,
612,0.97,3320.817,3334.631,"And--looking at--there have been some great negotiations in terms of--recognizing the value of these workers who are, Disproportionally people of color.",56,,
613,0.97,3334.631,3336.499,And women.,56,,
614,0.97,3336.499,3347.243,"And finding ways to look at workforce policies, and access to Healthcare, and wages as being critical.",56,,
615,0.97,3347.243,3358.054,"We are fortunate compared to other countries, other States,--in terms of the progressive policy.",56,,
616,0.97,3358.054,3364.961,That we have enacted around livable wages and minimum wages.,56,,
617,0.97,3364.961,3368.298,I think we have to build on that and look at access to benefits.,56,,
618,0.97,3368.298,3374.771,But also find ways to structure ways for some of the smaller businesses to make that affordable.,56,,
619,0.97,3374.771,3386.483,So that they can support--they can pay Healthcare and other benefits.,56,,
620,0.97,3386.483,3389.285,The people that have been most impacted are losing their access to Healthcare.,56,,
621,0.97,3389.285,3397.06,They are ones that are because they are living and they are the most vulnerable he financially our risk.,56,,
622,0.97,3397.06,3400.296,We are seeing that there is huge challenges.,56,,
623,0.97,3400.296,3408.304,"So, part of it is going to be around advocacy, but it's also looking at how we don't just try to stick people back in jobs.",56,,
624,0.97,3408.304,3414.611,But we really look at providing opportunities for up Skilling.,56,,
625,0.97,3414.611,3420.784,Really working on--with employers on career pathways.,56,,
626,0.97,3420.784,3425.488,"Some of those career pathways that we are operating in the past, I would say like the airport.",56,,
627,0.97,3425.488,3427.924,Used to have built-in career pathways.,56,,
628,0.97,3427.924,3433.596,"As job started getting privatized, people then got stuck in some of the lower wage jobs.",56,,
629,0.97,3433.596,3439.602,How do we start rebuilding some of those pathways and take advantage of employers' needs for up Skilling?,56,,
630,0.97,3439.602,3441.538,And new skills?,56,,
631,0.97,3441.538,3447.243,I think there is just going to be--there is a lot of work to do.,56,,
632,0.97,3447.243,3456.152,There is no like clear answers but I think there has been some examples of things that have worked nationally.,56,,
633,0.97,3456.152,3464.727,"It's important that we bring worker organizations, community industry, and public policy to the table.",56,,
634,0.97,3464.727,3469.532,It's really a whole Ecosystem that needs to change.,56,,
635,0.97,3469.532,3472.936,"Thank you, Marie for that.",57,,
636,0.97,3472.936,3478.675,"Colleagues, we are running a little long already.",57,,
637,0.97,3478.675,3479.542,About 15 minutes long.,57,,
638,0.97,3479.542,3488.284,I'm going to go ahead and handed over to Councilmember Morales who can provide us with any sort of last questions and closing remarks on this presentation.,57,,
639,0.97,3488.284,3490.286,Thank you.,58,,
640,0.97,3490.286,3499.762,"I want to thank everybody, Bobby, and Pedro, Beto and Marie, Inc.",58,,
641,0.97,3499.762,3502.866,You all for being here and helping us understand these issues a little bit better.,58,,
642,0.97,3502.866,3506.703,I think it is a really important reality check on who is suffering.,58,,
643,0.97,3506.703,3508.771,We are all struggling here.,58,,
644,0.97,3508.771,3514.878,But the recovery is really hitting women and communities of color particularly hard.,58,,
645,0.97,3514.878,3534.731,"We need to make sure that we are--when we are talking about how we support small business, understand that it is not just the 500 or fewer employees small business, we are talking about mom and pop shops that are really requiring these businesses for their livelihood.",58,,
646,0.97,3534.731,3536.9,And for the livelihood of their employees.,58,,
647,0.97,3536.9,3545.408,"And that we think about the next system, you know this current system is not serving all of us.",58,,
648,0.97,3545.408,3553.516,"Whatever we do to come out and prepare ourselves for recovery, we need to make sure that we are rooted in taking care of people.",58,,
649,0.97,3553.516,3563.76,"Taking care of one another and that we are centering racial equity and as Councilmember Mosqueda said, the dignity that comes with Self- determination.",58,,
650,0.97,3563.76,3568.231,As we make policy decisions that will have very acute impacts on our neighbors.,58,,
651,0.97,3568.231,3573.536,I want to thank the Presenters for sharing your expertise with us.,58,,
652,0.97,3573.536,3580.777,We welcome any information that you want to share down the road as well.,58,,
653,0.97,3580.777,3581.277,Thanks.,58,,
654,0.97,3581.277,3583.479,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",59,,
655,0.97,3583.479,3596.059,"For those words, and for offering to organize this presentation for Council briefing today.",59,,
656,0.97,3596.059,3598.761,It's timely particularly as we go ahead and transition into our fourth agenda item.,59,,
657,0.97,3598.761,3605.568,Which is a presentation on the use of Federal and state grants for Covid-19 emergency response.,60,,
658,0.97,3605.568,3607.003,We are joined by several individuals.,60,,
659,0.97,3607.003,3614.777,I'm going to go ahead and thank all of our Presenters who were on the line here for the first presentation.,60,,
660,0.97,3614.777,3621.384,You are all welcome to stay on the line or go on with your day.,60,,
661,0.97,3621.384,3622.885,However you wish.,60,,
662,0.97,3622.885,3631.394,I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Councilmember Mosqueda who is going to introduce this panel and make some introductory comments.,60,,
663,0.97,3631.394,3634.831,"Again colleagues, we are running about 15 minutes long already.",60,,
664,0.97,3634.831,3635.164,This morning.,60,,
665,0.97,3635.164,3647.944,"If we can keep our comments concise, and tight, so that we have enough time for the presentations and any questions, I would surely appreciate it.",60,,
666,0.97,3647.944,3651.347,"So, Councilmember Mosqueda, the floor is yours.",60,,
667,0.97,3651.347,3652.382,Thank you Council President.,61,,
668,0.97,3652.382,3654.617,I'm going to take your advice and be very Sexting.,61,,
669,0.97,3654.617,3660.123,Today we have in front of us director Ben noble from the budget office.,61,,
670,0.97,3660.123,3661.624,And Adrienne Thompson from the Mayor's office.,61,,
671,0.97,3661.624,3674.27,I think it's important for us to be as transparent and responsive to both Council questions and community questions about how we are using and deploying Federal and state grants for Covid emergency response.,61,,
672,0.97,3674.27,3684.847,That is precisely why they are here for us to give us a preview of the legislation that we are looking forward to sponsoring and getting your feedback.,61,,
673,0.97,3684.847,3690.319,"Director noble, I think I'll leave it at that and turn it over to you and the Mayor's office to walk us through the legislation.",61,,
674,0.97,3690.319,3690.686,Thank you.,62,,
675,0.97,3690.686,3693.189,I'm going to turn it very quickly over to Adrienne Thompson.,62,,
676,0.97,3693.189,3698.094,She is going to provide you an initial overview.,62,,
677,0.97,3698.094,3701.264,I'm going to step in for some details on the budget side of this.,62,,
678,0.97,3701.264,3703.399,We also have Emily Alvarado from the office of housing.,62,,
679,0.97,3703.399,3713.476,And Judy dimly who was also on the CBO staff to give you more of the details about the specific legislation which we have sent down with just a piece.,62,,
680,0.97,3713.476,3716.512,We have implemented a piece of the overall strategy.,62,,
681,0.97,3716.512,3717.18,"With that, Adrienne?",62,,
682,0.97,3717.18,3718.614,Thank you.,63,,
683,0.97,3718.614,3721.984,Hopefully folks can see my screen.,63,,
684,0.97,3721.984,3727.29,Okay.,63,,
685,0.97,3727.29,3730.76,Thank you all for this opportunity to walk through with you the Federal and state funding.,63,,
686,0.97,3730.76,3736.833,Kind of a larger strategy in the big picture today.,63,,
687,0.97,3736.833,3739.302,"Then, also focus in a little bit on the legislation itself.",63,,
688,0.97,3739.302,3747.31,"So, where we want to start is we want to give you an overview of what our city activity Up-To- date are.",63,,
689,0.97,3747.31,3754.751,Our reimbursement strategies taking into consideration all the different funding streams.,63,,
690,0.97,3754.751,3760.356,"And then give you a real good Overlayon how those funding, the funding streams and sources actually build up into a Matrix.",63,,
691,0.97,3760.356,3767.764,That can help give you a sense of the strategies moving forward.,63,,
692,0.97,3767.764,3771.768,"Then, we want to do a deeper dive into the legislation that you have all seen.",63,,
693,0.97,3771.768,3776.873,"So, first, sorry, just closing my screen so I can see.",63,,
694,0.97,3776.873,3777.44,Okay.,63,,
695,0.97,3777.44,3780.276,The first is we have kind of broken it up into three different buckets.,63,,
696,0.97,3780.276,3781.544,One is the stimulus funds themselves.,63,,
697,0.97,3781.544,3786.549,Our team has reviewed all of the stimulus packages at the Federal level.,63,,
698,0.97,3786.549,3792.488,"One, two, three, and what is referred to as 3 1/2 that was just past last week.",63,,
699,0.97,3792.488,3799.795,The bulk of the funding that is a part of the stimulus dollars actually begins and belongs in the C.A.R.E.S.,63,,
700,0.97,3799.795,3801.264,Act three.,63,,
701,0.97,3801.264,3803.9,That is the deeper dive we are going to do today.,63,,
702,0.97,3803.9,3816.712,The rest of it did not include direct funding necessarily to the state.,63,,
703,0.97,3816.712,3819.916,"As the third package has been released, we have been seeking the funds that become available.",63,,
704,0.97,3819.916,3821.083,Not all of them are available.,63,,
705,0.97,3821.083,3823.82,We are still waiting for guidance from the Feds on some of the funds.,63,,
706,0.97,3823.82,3827.123,We are also identifying gaps where there are some significant areas missing especially around community needs.,63,,
707,0.97,3827.123,3828.624,Around rental assistance.,63,,
708,0.97,3828.624,3839.402,"Small business, you saw what past last week to help support business community as well as food has been a significant issue throughout the country.",63,,
709,0.97,3839.402,3842.738,We are trying to identify those gaps for another package.,63,,
710,0.97,3842.738,3845.341,The next set of funding streams is FEMA assistance dollars.,63,,
711,0.97,3845.341,3848.344,These are not tied to the stimulus funds.,63,,
712,0.97,3848.344,3854.817,"These are their own separate bucket of funds, and this is tied to any type of natural disaster that would normally occur.",63,,
713,0.97,3854.817,3857.753,"In this case, it's considered a disaster.",63,,
714,0.97,3857.753,3863.693,"So, we have submitted for Preapproval for reimbursement, and are now submitting for reimbursements themselves.",63,,
715,0.97,3863.693,3866.562,I'll do a deeper dive about what those individual items are.,63,,
716,0.97,3866.562,3872.902,"The third stream that we are also looking at is kind of response, reopen, and recovery plan.",63,,
717,0.97,3872.902,3874.837,"With that, we are still in the response phase.",63,,
718,0.97,3874.837,3887.183,"We are still dealing with lack of testing, not a significant contact tracing at this point.",63,,
719,0.97,3887.183,3892.388,"Until there are certain things that can be met we still are in the phase of the stay home, stay healthy order under the governor.",63,,
720,0.97,3892.388,3895.958,As well as just the general response of the city.,63,,
721,0.97,3895.958,3898.961,We are also in the process of trying to determine what the reopen plan looks like.,63,,
722,0.97,3898.961,3901.564,We know that some States of started to go through that phase.,63,,
723,0.97,3901.564,3909.305,"We are concerned with the lack of testing, and contact tracing is very difficult for us to reopen immediately.",63,,
724,0.97,3909.305,3911.507,We are going to have to look at that for business.,63,,
725,0.97,3911.507,3912.909,Then we have the recovery plan itself.,63,,
726,0.97,3912.909,3916.178,Which will last a couple years.,63,,
727,0.97,3916.178,3919.015,Right now we are trying to identify capital projects for future stimulus dollars.,63,,
728,0.97,3919.015,3926.989,"Continue our response efforts in the develop, reopen, and recover:.",63,,
729,0.97,3926.989,3931.027,"Overall, our reimbursement strategy is we wanted to pursue FEMA reimbursement where possible.",63,,
730,0.97,3931.027,3933.296,This is the first item we should go after.,63,,
731,0.97,3933.296,3937.934,This is where the most amount of dollars are.,63,,
732,0.97,3937.934,3940.403,"Then, our second strategy is to allocate the restricted C.A.R.E.S.",63,,
733,0.97,3940.403,3941.003,Act funding.,63,,
734,0.97,3941.003,3942.838,That is the legislation that is before you all today.,63,,
735,0.97,3942.838,3949.445,The third strategy is there is a part of the stimulus three dollars.,63,,
736,0.97,3949.445,3954.05,There was 131 1/2 million dollars Coronavirus relief funds.,63,,
737,0.97,3954.05,3959.255,We just got direction very late last week on how we can use that.,63,,
738,0.97,3959.255,3962.625,We are now researching what we can and can't use that on right now.,63,,
739,0.97,3962.625,3968.03,Then would like to come back to you on what the strategies would be associated with those particular funds.,63,,
740,0.97,3968.03,3976.138,We also have the $13 million from the State Department of Commerce that has some level of flexibility.,63,,
741,0.97,3976.138,3981.01,We want to use those dollars as the last dollars to fill in some of the gaps where the C.A.R.E.S.,63,,
742,0.97,3981.01,3986.282,Act and the Coronavirus relief Fund are unable to meet some of the needs.,63,,
743,0.97,3986.282,3991.687,"So, I'm going to go through the first streamline of funding which is the FEMA public assistance.",63,,
744,0.97,3991.687,3999.695,What we do now is the Feds will reimburse us FEMA assistance dollars at 75%.,63,,
745,0.97,3999.695,4003.299,"It is an unlimited amount of money, meaning there is no cap on the amount of dollars.",63,,
746,0.97,4003.299,4004.867,They will only reimburse at a 75% level.,63,,
747,0.97,4004.867,4009.872,There were some initial guidance from the state that they would make up the difference of the 25%.,63,,
748,0.97,4009.872,4018.414,"We just learned last week that they may not, and that is still an open discussion that we are having with the state right now.",63,,
749,0.97,4018.414,4026.822,The categories that we can provide to FEMA that we understand based on kind of Preapproval and guidance that FEMA has already provided is the Ppe cleaning.,63,,
750,0.97,4026.822,4034.83,"Staffing, administrative costs, cleaning, and food.",63,,
751,0.97,4034.83,4038.667,"What we've requested Preapproval for, and what we have started to seek funding for directly, as the bottom half.",63,,
752,0.97,4038.667,4041.537,Which is the Non-Congregant sheltering.,63,,
753,0.97,4041.537,4042.471,Congregant sheltering.,63,,
754,0.97,4042.471,4056.919,"Hygiene, logistic supply warehouse, and then we are in coordination with the stay right now to figure out how do we help support our food and food delivery and food banks.",63,,
755,0.97,4056.919,4065.327,"The warehouse, we have had some challenges with FEMA.",63,,
756,0.97,4065.327,4069.465,A couple weeks ago they have released an expedited worksheet which was about a five page worksheet document.,63,,
757,0.97,4069.465,4071.3,"We had billed those out, submitted it through our portal.",63,,
758,0.97,4071.3,4078.874,It was then asked to provide some additional information.,63,,
759,0.97,4078.874,4082.678,We provided the additional information and then FEMA just last week came out with a new expedited worksheet.,63,,
760,0.97,4082.678,4084.88,"Now, we are having to fill out a different worksheet to submit.",63,,
761,0.97,4084.88,4089.285,It has now gone from five pages to 30 pages.,63,,
762,0.97,4089.285,4090.886,We are working to those processes right now.,63,,
763,0.97,4090.886,4101.464,"As I mentioned on the food side, if FEMA SEES that a local jurisdiction has other access to funding, they may not be Reimbursing us for this.",63,,
764,0.97,4101.464,4113.409,"Because the state has some lines of funding coming directly to the state for food, we have to work very close coordination with the state to make sure that what we submit in food, will actually be covered and not rejected because the state is already covered some of it.",63,,
765,0.97,4113.409,4115.411,That's the FEMA side.,63,,
766,0.97,4115.411,4118.514,Just a couple quick notes.,64,,
767,0.97,4118.514,4121.317,"One is that as labeled, this is reimbursement.",64,,
768,0.97,4121.317,4128.324,"We are spending these dollars out front, and expecting to get payment from the funds.",64,,
769,0.97,4128.324,4133.329,The work isn't getting Preapproval.,64,,
770,0.97,4133.329,4137.333,Getting Preapproval ahead of those times is not important.,64,,
771,0.97,4137.333,4146.942,The last point is also important that FEMA's goal is to fill in where there are not other funding sources.,64,,
772,0.97,4146.942,4155.317,"Although they will pay for food, above and beyond what is otherwise being paid for.",64,,
773,0.97,4155.317,4161.991,"For instance if there are resources that are eligible for food, they have to use those first before we can get this FEMA reimbursement.",64,,
774,0.97,4161.991,4164.627,We will describe some more of that as we go forward here.,64,,
775,0.97,4164.627,4165.528,"Thanks, Adrienne.",64,,
776,0.97,4165.528,4169.665,Yep.,65,,
777,0.97,4169.665,4173.936,"The next bucket is the Federal dollars, and at the very bottom is the state on being.",65,,
778,0.97,4173.936,4176.472,The legislation that is before you is the top four.,65,,
779,0.97,4176.472,4179.875,Which is the Federal stimulus funds legislation.,65,,
780,0.97,4179.875,4186.282,"This includes community development programs, the emergency solution grants.",65,,
781,0.97,4186.282,4199.695,Housing opportunities for persons--and then the older Americans act funding for area agency on aging.,65,,
782,0.97,4199.695,4206.702,We know in these four different categories the exact allocation that the city of Seattle is receiving.,65,,
783,0.97,4206.702,4209.305,Two of them are formulas that are developed at the Federal level.,65,,
784,0.97,4209.305,4213.809,We have received these Fundings in the past.,65,,
785,0.97,4213.809,4215.077,And we will continue to receive them.,65,,
786,0.97,4215.077,4215.611,In the C.A.R.E.S.,65,,
787,0.97,4215.611,4219.215,"Act number three, this was the initial allotment.",65,,
788,0.97,4219.215,4222.117,We will be receiving a second allotment towards the end of this month.,65,,
789,0.97,4222.117,4223.719,We do not yet know how much.,65,,
790,0.97,4223.719,4227.323,We are still waiting for guidance on that.,65,,
791,0.97,4227.323,4229.425,They will be looking at how to do the formula Alkylation.,65,,
792,0.97,4229.425,4230.693,It will not be the same.,65,,
793,0.97,4230.693,4232.861,The next set of funding is future funding.,65,,
794,0.97,4232.861,4236.332,This is the Coronavirus relief Fund.,65,,
795,0.97,4236.332,4238.801,This is the 131 1/2 million I had referred to earlier.,65,,
796,0.97,4238.801,4241.537,"As I have mentioned, we just received guidance on this.",65,,
797,0.97,4241.537,4250.346,And we still need potentially additional clarity on it.,65,,
798,0.97,4250.346,4255.851,Once we have figured out the strategy around that we would like to come back to you all and talk about what that allocation could look like.,65,,
799,0.97,4255.851,4261.557,"Other funding, we are due to receive not quite yet, have received is the FDA formula funds for transit.",65,,
800,0.97,4261.557,4263.259,This is for the streetcar and Monorails.,65,,
801,0.97,4263.259,4264.126,We will receive 2.3 million.,65,,
802,0.97,4264.126,4271.033,The state and local law enforcement assistance grants we are going to receive 1.34 million.,65,,
803,0.97,4271.033,4275.137,That is in the application process right now.,65,,
804,0.97,4275.137,4279.375,The funds have been released in a sense where we have got direction from the agency to submit for those funds.,65,,
805,0.97,4279.375,4282.044,We are in the process of doing that now.,65,,
806,0.97,4282.044,4284.279,There is also the community service block grants.,65,,
807,0.97,4284.279,4286.248,It's unclear whether we are going to receive those.,65,,
808,0.97,4286.248,4286.949,We believe we will.,65,,
809,0.97,4286.949,4290.185,We are working on that.,65,,
810,0.97,4290.185,4294.39,"It will be less than $200,000.",65,,
811,0.97,4294.39,4301.296,The firefighter assistance grants for Ppe and related supplies just came out as far as guidance.,65,,
812,0.97,4301.296,4305.601,We are right now researching what we can submit for in that particular grand.,65,,
813,0.97,4305.601,4313.475,It is still unclear about the economic development assistance programs of the education and outreach related to housing and Covid.,65,,
814,0.97,4313.475,4315.11,We are still waiting for Federal guidance on these.,65,,
815,0.97,4315.11,4317.913,It is unclear whether we are directly able to apply yet or not.,65,,
816,0.97,4317.913,4321.817,I just wanted to highlight that those are other options that may exist for us under the stimulus three.,65,,
817,0.97,4321.817,4324.987,"The last of the state funding, the Department of Commerce and emergency housing grand.",65,,
818,0.97,4324.987,4328.524,Which we received 13 million.,65,,
819,0.97,4328.524,4329.992,Will receive 13 million for.,65,,
820,0.97,4329.992,4333.529,That is mainly to deal with some of the homelessness.,65,,
821,0.97,4333.529,4342.938,We believe this should be a last dealer in because it provides more flexibility than a lot of these other grants do.,65,,
822,0.97,4342.938,4345.808,"So, I'm going to turn this over to Ben for the next section.",65,,
823,0.97,4345.808,4352.347,This next graphic I don't actually expect you to be able to read.,66,,
824,0.97,4352.347,4355.15,We will new in the next couple slide to zoom in on pieces of it.,66,,
825,0.97,4355.15,4366.562,What I wanted to capture with this and describe to you is the work that the budget office is doing in consultation and partnership with the office of emergency management.,66,,
826,0.97,4366.562,4368.397,"And the office of Intergovernmental relations, and also key departments.",66,,
827,0.97,4368.397,4379.975,"What's represented here is the mapping that we are doing between the cities Covid related expenses, which are essentially the categories along the first column on the left.",66,,
828,0.97,4379.975,4392.087,"So, Ppe costs, city staff that have been redirected to the work, homelessness, you can read down the list.",66,,
829,0.97,4392.087,4395.157,"Those are things we know we need to be spending money on, investing in.",66,,
830,0.97,4395.157,4396.658,Across the top of the various funding sources.,66,,
831,0.97,4396.658,4401.663,"With the color coding, it indicates which funding sources can be used for which purposes.",66,,
832,0.97,4401.663,4415.711,"So, for instance, the big green swath down the middle of the chart, that is the Coronavirus relief fund of 131+ million dollars.",66,,
833,0.97,4415.711,4419.381,"We have gotten, we think it's more flexible than we had Additionally thought.",66,,
834,0.97,4419.381,4421.817,It's an eligible source to cover almost all of our expenses.,66,,
835,0.97,4421.817,4432.528,"I would note, just as part of this, the one place where it doesn't work, where we don't have any additional funding sources under general, the city revenue Backfill.",66,,
836,0.97,4432.528,4440.002,The question of whether the Coronavirus relief fund would provide just basic financial assistance to local and state governments.,66,,
837,0.97,4440.002,4443.906,The short answer is no.,66,,
838,0.97,4443.906,4446.742,There is now some debate we see about another source there.,66,,
839,0.97,4446.742,4453.448,"In general, you can read down a column, or read across from a need to see what sources are eligible.",66,,
840,0.97,4453.448,4464.059,"As we are looking to make recommendations to you about what resources to spend where, that is what's informing those recommendations.",66,,
841,0.97,4464.059,4475.704,"If we have a source that is particularly restricted, we will use that first, apply it to the restricted use is that it's allowed, thus making more money available on some of these flexible pots to meet other needs.",66,,
842,0.97,4475.704,4479.675,"I want to go ahead, Adrienne, show the next slide.",66,,
843,0.97,4479.675,4484.68,"This is just the same chart, but drilling edit essentially to the top half.",66,,
844,0.97,4484.68,4489.384,Looking at the first three categories.,66,,
845,0.97,4489.384,4493.088,"First of all protection equipment, city staff, and kind of General expenses.",66,,
846,0.97,4493.088,4499.761,"Again you can see for instance if you look down the FEMA category, it pays for personal protection equipment.",66,,
847,0.97,4499.761,4504.466,"Some limited amount of city staff time, essentially incremental city staff time.",66,,
848,0.97,4504.466,4506.902,"Overtime, or contract costs.",66,,
849,0.97,4506.902,4509.371,It won't cover base salaries.,66,,
850,0.97,4509.371,4519.414,"On the other hand, under some circumstances, we think the Coronavirus relief fund would cover those expenses.",66,,
851,0.97,4519.414,4524.186,This is kind of to give you a general feel for the mapping we have been doing at the analysis we have been doing.,66,,
852,0.97,4524.186,4525.22,"One more, Adrienne.",66,,
853,0.97,4525.22,4526.855,This ties into the rest of that truck.,66,,
854,0.97,4526.855,4528.924,I think and looks at homelessness.,66,,
855,0.97,4528.924,4530.225,Shelter redistribution.,66,,
856,0.97,4530.225,4532.528,That first line.,66,,
857,0.97,4532.528,4539.534,As you know we have been working to D Densify the shelters to create more room and less proximity.,66,,
858,0.97,4539.534,4544.506,There are a number of sources that can be used there as you can see.,66,,
859,0.97,4544.506,4552.414,"When we bring forward recommendations, we'll be informed by that--by those eligibility's.",66,,
860,0.97,4552.414,4555.45,"Again, to follow through on this.",66,,
861,0.97,4555.45,4562.157,Fema in general should be an eligible sources I was describing earlier.,66,,
862,0.97,4562.157,4565.26,They generally want to fill in after all the resources have been used that are eligible.,66,,
863,0.97,4565.26,4568.664,We want to just hold all of that.,66,,
864,0.97,4568.664,4572.734,They may require that we did invest some of the other Federal dollars in that space first if you will.,66,,
865,0.97,4572.734,4573.669,That's part of this analysis.,66,,
866,0.97,4573.669,4586.481,"This is the work that CBO in consultation what OA are, and office of emergency management, within individual departments you will hear this reporting from.",66,,
867,0.97,4586.481,4589.151,Housing is one example.,66,,
868,0.97,4589.151,4590.986,You also heard from Oed.,66,,
869,0.97,4590.986,4593.388,He's been a partner in this work.,66,,
870,0.97,4593.388,4603.098,"It's a pretty complicated story, but we are being careful and methodical about it.",66,,
871,0.97,4603.098,4608.403,"And we are prepared to bring forward a piece of legislation to cover the first allocation of resources, but there will be more to follow.",66,,
872,0.97,4608.403,4616.812,"With that, I think Julie is up next to give you more information on the specific legislation that we sent over.",66,,
873,0.97,4616.812,4620.415,Good morning Councilmembers.,67,,
874,0.97,4620.415,4625.087,"Thank you, Ben.",67,,
875,0.97,4625.087,4629.424,"As you heard from Adrienne, the legislation you are including today include several grants that were included in the Federal C.A.R.E.S.",67,,
876,0.97,4629.424,4629.725,Act.,67,,
877,0.97,4629.725,4634.63,Seattle has received direct allocation for some of these grants totaling about 14 million.,67,,
878,0.97,4634.63,4641.236,"We'll go into specifics for each of the grandson the following slides, but wanted to provide you with a high level look at our overall allocation strategy.",67,,
879,0.97,4641.236,4650.912,"For housing opportunities for people, for persons with AIDS, older Americans act, and the Medicaid title 19 funds, these are the most restrictive.",67,,
880,0.97,4650.912,4654.95,There was no need to reinvent the wheel.,67,,
881,0.97,4654.95,4660.422,The fastest way to get these out the door was to leverage existing programs.,67,,
882,0.97,4660.422,4664.626,"For the emergency solutions rent and the community development block grant, there was a little bit more work to do.",67,,
883,0.97,4664.626,4673.435,"As you saw in the Red and green chart that director noble walk you through, we identified areas about opportunity from each particular funding source and match those two lines of effort.",67,,
884,0.97,4673.435,4677.072,And community need.,67,,
885,0.97,4677.072,4680.709,We then look for gaps or areas where certain lines of effort have the Fewest alternatives for funding.,67,,
886,0.97,4680.709,4690.085,"Based on our assessment, our current expense with providers in the field, those gaps are in rental assistance, Small- business support, and food access and delivery.",67,,
887,0.97,4690.085,4695.757,"Now, we'll go into specifics of each of the grants.",67,,
888,0.97,4695.757,4697.793,"The city is set to receive about 425,000 for hospitals.",67,,
889,0.97,4697.793,4701.563,The problem is to support housing options and program services.,67,,
890,0.97,4701.563,4708.003,"For housing options, they are for low incomes persons with HIV aids and their families.",67,,
891,0.97,4708.003,4714.309,To maintain or acquire permanent affordable housing.,67,,
892,0.97,4714.309,4719.381,"For services, it can be used for a variety of services.",67,,
893,0.97,4719.381,4736.598,As well as--the programs are--include housing case management and are designed capability to maintain housing and facilitate progress toward a stable long-term Self- sufficient living.,67,,
894,0.97,4736.598,4742.204,"So, next we moved to the ads funding.",67,,
895,0.97,4742.204,4751.847,"As you know, the human services Department aging and disabilities service division is the area agency on aging for King County.",67,,
896,0.97,4751.847,4757.152,"In that capacity, they administer funding for older Americans from which the C.A.R.E.S.",67,,
897,0.97,4757.152,4761.957,Act we are going to receive $5 million from the older Americans act.,67,,
898,0.97,4761.957,4767.562,We will use this funding to expanding existing food delivery programs and a shift in program model from Seger Congregant meals to home delivery.,67,,
899,0.97,4767.562,4774.97,To facilitate appropriate social distancing for this population at a high risk for serious impacts from Covid-19.,67,,
900,0.97,4774.97,4781.743,"In addition, they're going to receive $150,000 from Medicaid.",67,,
901,0.97,4781.743,4784.846,Hse is going to add capacity for expedited Medicaid long- term services and supports initial assessments.,67,,
902,0.97,4784.846,4789.651,"Which assist hospital patient transition, to another care setting.",67,,
903,0.97,4789.651,4804.266,"In addition, funding will provide for care, transition services Tim Nonmedicated eligible individuals and ongoing Community-Based support.",67,,
904,0.97,4804.266,4809.604,"Moving to the emergency solutions grant, the city is set to receive about 2.83 million.",68,,
905,0.97,4809.604,4814.209,"This funding can be used for homelessness outreach, improving emergency shelter, availability and delivery--shelter operations.",68,,
906,0.97,4814.209,4816.778,Rapidly housing and homelessness prevention.,68,,
907,0.97,4816.778,4829.524,"So, in particular, when we look at that green and red chart, the areas that jumped out the most, again were rental assistance, economic development, and food access and delivery.",68,,
908,0.97,4829.524,4847.909,"So, in this category, we are using 750,000 to provide an alternate funding source, for a 2020 Council add, to prevent homelessness, for individuals transferring from essential needs or aged, blind, and disabled programs into SSI or Ssdi.",68,,
909,0.97,4847.909,4853.281,"Due to the general fund revenue forecast provision that you heard from director noble last Wednesday, this provides a more reliable funding mechanism for 2020.",68,,
910,0.97,4853.281,4858.72,We are also going to be using 2.08 million for shelter meals.,68,,
911,0.97,4858.72,4877.772,"So Hst is going to use funds for the added cost of delivering homelessness services at existing shelters during the outbreak and what we have heard the most from them, is the increased cost of moving from that Congregant meal, to the mill delivery, is one of the biggest cost drivers.",68,,
912,0.97,4877.772,4883.245,"Then, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Emily who is going to cover CDBG.",68,,
913,0.97,4883.245,4884.779,Good morning.,68,,
914,0.97,4884.779,4887.182,Good morning.,69,,
915,0.97,4887.182,4904.799,Thank you for having me to talk about the Mayor's proposed recommendation of $4.1 million in rental assistance with CDBG and then the 1.5 million to the office of economic development small business assistance.,69,,
916,0.97,4904.799,4912.107,I first want to cover the three bullets on this slide and provide a little bit of background information about rent assistance.,69,,
917,0.97,4912.107,4918.413,And then move into why we are proposing a three-part approach to distributing rent assistance.,69,,
918,0.97,4918.413,4926.721,"Clearly as you all know, we have more than half of Seattle's residents who are Renters.",69,,
919,0.97,4926.721,4930.225,"Many are severely, or are housing cost burdens.",69,,
920,0.97,4930.225,4935.13,Many people are struggling financially to pay their rent at this time.,69,,
921,0.97,4935.13,4944.039,"Regardless of governor Inslee's Eviction moratorium, Renters need to pay their rent in order to ensure long home thousand facility.",69,,
922,0.97,4944.039,4959.721,"Because of that reason, in early April, we announced our partnership with United way of King County to support an expanded program which provides rent assistance to households at 50% AMI or below.",69,,
923,0.97,4959.721,4963.558,Who showed economic impact from Covid.,69,,
924,0.97,4963.558,4970.632,And who did not pay their April rent.,69,,
925,0.97,4970.632,4979.941,We contributed $1 million to that program which leveraged additional King County and private philanthropic dollars.,69,,
926,0.97,4979.941,4982.444,The phone line and application process was kept open for several days.,69,,
927,0.97,4982.444,4989.284,I believe the responses really evidenced of the need for rental assistance.,69,,
928,0.97,4989.284,5004.899,United way received 6841 applications . 2570 were from the city of Seattle . over 70% of the applicants were people of color.,69,,
929,0.97,5004.899,5011.406,1866 applications were completed by folks who then requested follow-up in another language.,69,,
930,0.97,5011.406,5018.98,Over 3600 of the applicants had children under the age of 18.,69,,
931,0.97,5018.98,5030.325,"So, moving forward based on the information we understand from United way, we really want to allocate new Federal resources for rent assistance in a way that ensures three key objectives.",69,,
932,0.97,5030.325,5037.999,"One around equity, around accessibility, and around serving as many households as we can.",69,,
933,0.97,5037.999,5046.341,"On accessibility, I will say there is some benefit to having a place that we can direct people to call.",69,,
934,0.97,5046.341,5050.445,One easy stop for people to know about.,69,,
935,0.97,5050.445,5057.352,But accessibility is also about having appropriate language access so we can serve diverse communities.,69,,
936,0.97,5057.352,5066.561,"On equity, we want to make sure we are distributing resources in a way that serves vulnerable and Underserved households.",69,,
937,0.97,5066.561,5068.463,Including those households who are not connected to mainstream services.,69,,
938,0.97,5068.463,5072.967,We seek to use our Community- based partners as a way to do that.,69,,
939,0.97,5072.967,5080.675,"Around serving the most households, we want to make sure that we are getting as much direct assistance directly to households as we possibly can.",69,,
940,0.97,5080.675,5088.983,"For that reason, we have provided recommended this Three- part approach to rental assistance.",69,,
941,0.97,5088.983,5094.222,The first one you see there is 1.5 million for Hst's homelessness prevention program.,69,,
942,0.97,5094.222,5102.664,"As you know, they already administer rent assistance from the House levy to vulnerable households.",69,,
943,0.97,5102.664,5119.914,This expands that approach by Leveraging many Community-Based organizations who do that direct assistance so that we can have reach into various diverse cultural communities.,69,,
944,0.97,5119.914,5127.589,Those organizations already have a track record of providing financial assistance in a way that meets the individualized needs of households.,69,,
945,0.97,5127.589,5140.535,"The community organizations who do that work include [speaking in foreign language] interim move slum housing services, neighborhood health, Seattle Indian health, just to name a Úfew.",69,,
946,0.97,5140.535,5150.345,We recommend some rent assistance through that means for folks that are below 50% AMI and Covid impacted.,69,,
947,0.97,5150.345,5153.248,Because we can reach diverse Community-Based organizations.,69,,
948,0.97,5153.248,5163.424,"The second proposal is to increase, provide an additional $1.5 million to the United way's Home-Based rent assistance program.",69,,
949,0.97,5163.424,5166.161,We have made a very public announcement about that program already.,69,,
950,0.97,5166.161,5169.063,There is unmet need in that program.,69,,
951,0.97,5169.063,5183.344,Directing more resources can make sure that we are able to continue to keep people moving to that source who may already know about it but feel they were unable to get their rent assistance needs met.,69,,
952,0.97,5183.344,5195.49,"Third, the proposal is to put 1.14 million to our office to administer to nonprofit organizations, city funded affordable housing.",69,,
953,0.97,5195.49,5206.701,"The I.T . S is that, I meet almost every week--affordable housing.",69,,
954,0.97,5206.701,5213.374,What I hear from them is that they are working hard to serve their clients in this moment.,69,,
955,0.97,5213.374,5223.718,One of the challenges they are facing is that they are seeing a real precipitous increase in th amount of unpaid rent from March to April.,69,,
956,0.97,5223.718,5235.897,"It is worth pointing out that we have, of the affordable housing, we have funded around 3100 of those units have no operating subsidy.",69,,
957,0.97,5235.897,5243.838,"Which means they rely only on Tenant-Based rent, in order to get the rent paid.",69,,
958,0.97,5243.838,5247.442,"In those buildings for example, a majority of those units are owned by bellwether housing.",69,,
959,0.97,5247.442,5255.416,And bellwether saw a 15% increase in unpaid rent from March to April.,69,,
960,0.97,5255.416,5263.958,"Property managers report that many of those households are working in restaurants, retail, or are so business proprietors.",69,,
961,0.97,5263.958,5272.867,What we are able to do is to provide direct assistance to our city funded housing providers who don't have an operating subsidy.,69,,
962,0.97,5272.867,5277.538,And then cover the rent for Nonpaid rent in those buildings.,69,,
963,0.97,5277.538,5287.882,The benefits there are that the nonprofit housing providers already have documentation about income eligibility on hand.,69,,
964,0.97,5287.882,5297.191,"In addition, by providing that rent assistance, you serve the individual household and the building and the nonprofit.",69,,
965,0.97,5297.191,5307.168,That sums up a proposal to contribute 4.14 million and rent assistance in a three-part way that really hits a lot of our key city objectives.,69,,
966,0.97,5307.168,5313.875,I'll turn it over to Julie to talk more about small business.,69,,
967,0.97,5313.875,5314.709,"Thanks so much, Emily.",70,,
968,0.97,5314.709,5326.521,"As you heard this morning from Oed, in the presentation, the small business stabilization fund had an incredible number of applications that the city has been unable to fulfill at this point.",70,,
969,0.97,5326.521,5332.66,The proposal here is to take an additional 1.5 million and provided for Oed small business stabilization fund.,70,,
970,0.97,5332.66,5340.034,To support those smallest businesses facing the severe financial challenges as a result of this crisis.,70,,
971,0.97,5340.034,5346.841,"So then, we only have I think two more slides.",70,,
972,0.97,5346.841,5347.842,We'll go through this quickly.,70,,
973,0.97,5347.842,5348.81,I know we are approaching time.,70,,
974,0.97,5348.81,5355.717,I wanted to point out a couple of nuances with CDBG.,70,,
975,0.97,5355.717,5358.419,"In the traditional Non-Covid world, we think of CDBG is quite restrictive.",70,,
976,0.97,5358.419,5366.494,It's kind of funny for someone like the to consider this a very flexible source in this environment.,70,,
977,0.97,5366.494,5367.362,"Alas, here we are.",70,,
978,0.97,5367.362,5368.93,It's important to know that the C.A.R.E.S.,70,,
979,0.97,5368.93,5371.966,Act has waived the public services cap for 2019 and 2020 CDBG.,70,,
980,0.97,5371.966,5376.437,This is typically capped at about 15%.,70,,
981,0.97,5376.437,5380.341,That means those are services that are provided like an hour homelessness shelters.,70,,
982,0.97,5380.341,5380.775,For example.,70,,
983,0.97,5380.775,5389.484,"Typically that's a limited amount, but now it has been opened up a little bit more broadly.",70,,
984,0.97,5389.484,5392.754,"Specifically for rental assistance, important to note that CDBG is capped at three months of support.",70,,
985,0.97,5392.754,5394.422,It must be provided to the landlord.,70,,
986,0.97,5394.422,5395.189,It can't go to individuals.,70,,
987,0.97,5395.189,5400.395,That's why we have shaped this proposal in the way that we have.,70,,
988,0.97,5400.395,5407.902,"For small business support, they are using what's called the urgent need national objective.",70,,
989,0.97,5407.902,5412.607,This allows Oed to process applications more quickly.,70,,
990,0.97,5412.607,5420.915,"Importantly, that urgent need national objective is capped at 30% of our three-year cumulative total that we spent under that category.",70,,
991,0.97,5420.915,5423.985,Which we estimate to be between seven and 8 million.,70,,
992,0.97,5423.985,5431.826,This legislation in front of you would take our running total in that three-year window under that objective to about 4 million.,70,,
993,0.97,5431.826,5440.435,"Finally, as Adrian mentioned at the top, this is our initial allocation from the C.A.R.E.S.",70,,
994,0.97,5440.435,5441.035,Act.,70,,
995,0.97,5441.035,5444.939,We anticipate this being the largest allocation we are going to receive of CDBG and EST.,70,,
996,0.97,5444.939,5449.544,We don't yet know when the second formula is going to come.,70,,
997,0.97,5449.544,5455.716,"It is going to be a slightly different formula, I believe it's going to be administered by the States.",70,,
998,0.97,5455.716,5458.519,It's going to be based on Covid- 19 prevalence factors.,70,,
999,0.97,5458.519,5463.558,"We don't have the specifics just yet, but anticipate those coming very soon.",70,,
1000,0.97,5463.558,5471.933,We would bring that back to the Council for additional consideration.,70,,
1001,0.97,5471.933,5472.567,Great.,71,,
1002,0.97,5472.567,5474.335,Thank you so much for that presentation.,71,,
1003,0.97,5474.335,5479.44,Obviously a lot of information.,71,,
1004,0.97,5479.44,5480.074,Contained there.,71,,
1005,0.97,5480.074,5500.895,"Some stuff that we know, and some stuff that we are still waiting to get more details about but certainly appreciate your all's interest in being with us this morning and talk to us about what we can expect to see in terms of this afternoon's legislation.",71,,
1006,0.97,5500.895,5502.597,I know that Councilmember Mosqueda has a question.,71,,
1007,0.97,5502.597,5503.998,She'll want to make some closing remarks.,71,,
1008,0.97,5503.998,5518.846,"Before she makes closing remarks, if you have a question on this presentation, please, please do let me know by either raising your hand, with your camera on, or shooting me a quick message to let me know that you have a question.",71,,
1009,0.97,5518.846,5520.314,I'll put you into the Queue.,71,,
1010,0.97,5520.314,5528.022,"For now, just pending that, invitation, I'll go ahead and yield the floor over to Councilmember Mosqueda.",71,,
1011,0.97,5528.022,5533.427,Thanks very much Council President.,72,,
1012,0.97,5533.427,5535.429,Thank you all for the presentation of the Walk- through today.,72,,
1013,0.97,5535.429,5537.999,Just two questions because I know we are running short on time.,72,,
1014,0.97,5537.999,5553.147,"Number one, on the issue of the Gentrification of shelters, can you tell us a little bit more about how that the Densification funding can be used for hotel rooms as you noted, Congregant shelter settings are increasingly clear that they are dangerous.",72,,
1015,0.97,5553.147,5556.45,And allowing for the spread of Covid.,72,,
1016,0.97,5556.45,5562.757,"As we shift to different models, it's important for us to know if we are able to use those the Densification dollars for hotel rooms.",72,,
1017,0.97,5562.757,5578.172,"Working in partnership with United, local eight, and our Artners to keep those.",72,,
1018,0.97,5578.606,5581.976,I believe we are working on raising $57 million that will be partly used for hotel rooms.,72,,
1019,0.97,5581.976,5592.987,I'm wondering if we're doing anything along the same lines to scale up our funding for decreasing Congregant shelters for by moving folks into hotels.,72,,
1020,0.97,5592.987,5594.655,"Icu Ben, probably Teed up to answer that.",72,,
1021,0.97,5594.655,5597.892,I'll throw out the second question so you guys can possibly answer it together.,72,,
1022,0.97,5597.892,5607.802,It was noted that we are going to use the 13 million from the state as a possible way to fill the budget holes because of the flexibility.,72,,
1023,0.97,5607.802,5611.339,I understand the desire to make sure we are Leveraging our other funds in every possible way.,72,,
1024,0.97,5611.339,5618.546,Could you give us a better Timeline on how we plan on waiting?,72,,
1025,0.97,5618.546,5627.722,"How soon we will know what those budget holes are so we can quickly get that 13 million out, and not into--and not sit on the 13 million for too long?",72,,
1026,0.97,5627.722,5628.99,Thanks for the Timeline on that.,72,,
1027,0.97,5628.99,5632.827,Real quick on that second question first if you will.,73,,
1028,0.97,5632.827,5635.93,I failed to make this point when I was getting kind of the overview.,73,,
1029,0.97,5635.93,5637.264,Urgency is clearly in our heads.,73,,
1030,0.97,5637.264,5640.301,Getting these dollars out the door.,73,,
1031,0.97,5640.301,5643.337,They are meant for relief and that is what we intend to do with them.,73,,
1032,0.97,5643.337,5647.441,We only just last Wednesday night got direction on the hundred and 30.,73,,
1033,0.97,5647.441,5652.313,I would say in the next couple weeks we should be able to come back to with the overall strategy on the 130.,73,,
1034,0.97,5652.313,5656.017,From that follows the strategy on the grant from Commerce.,73,,
1035,0.97,5656.017,5665.292,"We are close to being there, but just hearing from the fact that we got last week was a critical piece we didn't have for.",73,,
1036,0.97,5665.292,5672.366,Julie may have some more also to say on the Non-Congregant shelter.,73,,
1037,0.97,5672.366,5677.872,What I can say at a high level is that we have been coordinating a good deal on Tking up different responsibilities for this overall.,73,,
1038,0.97,5677.872,5689.483,"The County has led considerably, but not exclusively, to find facilities and moving folks there.",73,,
1039,0.97,5689.483,5694.989,We have spent more time on the service associated with some of that.,73,,
1040,0.97,5694.989,5698.793,"And actually our own shelters themselves, the ones we had operated before.",73,,
1041,0.97,5698.793,5701.862,There are two things going on.,73,,
1042,0.97,5701.862,5715.876,We are defense of find the shelters and trying to provide new sheltering opportunities for those that are--have been outside of our systems and also living--I don't know Julie if you have more to add there.,73,,
1043,0.97,5715.876,5720.114,You're absolutely correct.,74,,
1044,0.97,5720.114,5722.783,The County has taken a lead on isolation and quarantine rooms.,74,,
1045,0.97,5722.783,5734.128,The city has been focused mostly on trying to provide additional spacing for our additional shelters.,74,,
1046,0.97,5734.128,5738.699,That is opening up community centers and our large facilities that aren't in use right now at Seattle center for example.,74,,
1047,0.97,5738.699,5742.636,"Your specific question was whether, what funding source we could use for hotels and whether that is under consideration.",74,,
1048,0.97,5742.636,5749.81,I believe the county has pursued FEMA Preapproval for that.,74,,
1049,0.97,5749.81,5751.612,We have not yet for that specific item.,74,,
1050,0.97,5751.612,5754.648,I do believe it would be FEMA eligible.,74,,
1051,0.97,5754.648,5759.153,It could also be a use of the Commerce grant if for whatever reason we ran into trouble with FEMA.,74,,
1052,0.97,5759.153,5766.26,That is a strategy that is on the table and that we are considering.,74,,
1053,0.97,5766.26,5768.462,"Okay, thank you.",75,,
1054,0.97,5768.462,5771.732,So much.,75,,
1055,0.97,5771.732,5775.469,We have one other person who has indicated to me they have a question.,75,,
1056,0.97,5775.469,5776.103,That's Councilmember Herbold.,75,,
1057,0.97,5776.103,5777.538,I will yield the floor to her.,75,,
1058,0.97,5777.538,5778.639,Thank you.,76,,
1059,0.97,5778.639,5796.657,"I'm just wondering whether or not the hygiene line in the projected spending assumes additional facilities will be stood up, or if that just covers the cost that we have already expended?",76,,
1060,0.97,5796.657,5798.759,All right.,77,,
1061,0.97,5798.759,5801.562,I think it's the cost we've already expended.,77,,
1062,0.97,5801.562,5817.011,"As you know, we have been deploying sanitation facilities, Handwashing facilities, and we are now looking to open, I don't know the timing of this, opening several libraries the Restroom and sanitation facilities there.",77,,
1063,0.97,5817.011,5821.482,Those costs could increase.,77,,
1064,0.97,5821.482,5827.822,Because of a public health order that has identified that those services are a priority.,77,,
1065,0.97,5827.822,5830.291,That should all be FEMA eligible at the 75%.,77,,
1066,0.97,5830.291,5844.505,"Then again, we are getting some clarity on whether the state will cover the last 25, or whether we should be reserving a component of the $130 million Corona relief fund dollars as potentially our local match.",77,,
1067,0.97,5844.505,5847.741,"Great, thank you.",78,,
1068,0.97,5847.741,5852.546,Any other questions or comments from my colleagues?,78,,
1069,0.97,5852.546,5857.451,"Okay, Councilmember Mosqueda, any closing comments on this presentation?",78,,
1070,0.97,5857.451,5863.123,Thanks again to the folks at CBO.,79,,
1071,0.97,5863.123,5873.467,I want to acknowledge how fast you are working to try to identify the Federal dollars and any local services we are able to identify as well.,79,,
1072,0.97,5873.467,5879.373,I think we'll be looking to get more information from you all about the details on the sense of vacation.,79,,
1073,0.97,5879.373,5889.483,And what the recommendations are to be in harmony of the county effort to make sure there is a better understanding of how we are shifting to this different model.,79,,
1074,0.97,5889.483,5903.063,"Hopefully using the hotel rooms in partnership with unite care, not just for first responders, but also for our homeless population and those who are serving the homeless population.",79,,
1075,0.97,5903.063,5908.469,"I'll also just know for our colleagues and for the general public, this is really the first step of Federal funding on Covid response.",79,,
1076,0.97,5908.469,5916.81,What we do and how we engage I think helps set the tone for our priorities in the recovery and response period.,79,,
1077,0.97,5916.81,5921.482,Let's not Sugarcoat that we don't know how long we are going to be in the response period until we get to recovery.,79,,
1078,0.97,5921.482,5924.285,"Appreciate you being very transparent with us, the detailed slides that you articulated.",79,,
1079,0.97,5924.285,5931.992,I do want to make sure that we have a clear Timeline for the public so they know it's not just within the next few weeks.,79,,
1080,0.97,5931.992,5941.935,That we have a calendar that we are working on in a transparent way to make sure people know at which point they will get more information and how they can engage.,79,,
1081,0.97,5941.935,5945.539,I think there was a real sense of urgency.,79,,
1082,0.97,5945.539,5950.644,I appreciate the quickness in which you are working.,79,,
1083,0.97,5950.644,5956.55,And also that there is the strong desire to make sure the public can still weigh in on how we are spending the dollars and where the greatest need is.,79,,
1084,0.97,5956.55,5969.863,"Specifically, because we have seen how Covid has exacerbated those inequities especially for communities of colors, low-wage workers, immigrants, women, that we party talked about today and in the past few weeks.",79,,
1085,0.97,5969.863,5975.469,That's why it's extremely important for us to both have the details and ensure that we are sharing it and getting feedback from the public.,79,,
1086,0.97,5975.469,5978.539,"Thank you for this first presentation, I assume it will be one of many to come.",79,,

1170,0.97,6463.356,6469.529,"They need to absorb the cost of this, it is not working people.",86,,
1171,0.97,6469.529,6473.533,"Not struggling small businesses, and not small landlords.",86,,
1172,0.97,6473.533,6497.29,"At the town halls both on Saturday and the one we held on April 16th, we heard from Rantings who are organizing in their buildings when their corporate landlords or their part--have so far reserved to work with the Renters even after the Renters have as a group as a collective, approached the landlords are the property management corporations with very reasonable request for adjustments in their rent.",86,,
1173,0.97,6497.29,6500.36,They actually can't pay.,86,,
1174,0.97,6500.36,6503.797,These are working people who have lost their jobs and they are not able to pay rent.,86,,
1175,0.97,6503.797,6509.069,"In particular, we heard from the tenants who are organizing and what's called the bedlam one building.",86,,
1176,0.97,6509.069,6518.411,"That is on Capitol Hill, and that is owned by a billionaire couple, but it is managed by a big corporation.",86,,
1177,0.97,6518.411,6523.583,"In the greater Seattle area, it owns over 5500 residential apartments.",86,,
1178,0.97,6523.583,6533.093,They also own many commercial properties . own or manage commercial properties.,86,,
1179,0.97,6533.093,6546.439,"This morning, the Seattle times, who were listening in on our town hall, published a really excellent article about this struggle, and about what tenants are doing.",86,,
1180,0.97,6546.439,6561.154,"And just to give you a sense of where the struggle is, 37 out of the 40 tenants in the building have signed onto a collective letter to Cornell and Associates demanding that they address the immediate crisis.",86,,
1181,0.97,6561.154,6569.429,"Many of those tenants are line cooks, Servers, Baristas, Tech workers, Healthcare workers, many of them are struggling to get by like Healthcare workers.",86,,
1182,0.97,6569.429,6574.668,Many have been totally laid off with no prospect of work in the near future.,86,,
1183,0.97,6574.668,6588.281,"Despite them making reasonable requests, Cornell and Associates responded to them by telling them they need to pay their rent and they should ask their parents for money.",86,,
1184,0.97,6588.281,6590.55,They should use their savings or take on credit card debt.,86,,
1185,0.97,6590.55,6596.59,This is absolutely unacceptable it is unconscionable.,86,,
1186,0.97,6596.59,6597.991,The tenants have built their own struggle.,86,,
1187,0.97,6597.991,6603.697,"What we did in the town hall, to my Council office, is brought their voice forward.",86,,
1188,0.97,6603.697,6610.47,I have sent a letter to Cornell and Associates saying it's only reasonable they should accept these demands on the tenants because they're not going to be able to deal with this crisis.,86,,
1189,0.97,6610.47,6611.871,Wears a big corporation like Cornell can.,86,,
1190,0.97,6611.871,6617.51,So far Cornell has not responded to my letter or to the tenants and their demands.,86,,
1191,0.97,6617.51,6633.126,"We will keep the struggle up and in fact, through the town hall and through community input, Cornell should have received now over 150 letters from community members saying that they should accept what the tenants are asking for.",86,,
1192,0.97,6633.126,6635.595,And that they should find a reasonable agreement with the tenants.,86,,
1193,0.97,6635.595,6650.043,"What happened to the town hall also, is that many other tenants who are living in other buildings, managed by Cornell and Associates, also spoke, you know through the live feed and they are now also going to start organizing.",86,,
1194,0.97,6650.043,6656.549,"I just wanted also to report that Cornell, rather than responding to the tenants and responded to my office, they have shut down their Website.",86,,
1195,0.97,6656.549,6663.857,"And they gave a very sort of hateful comments to the Seattle times saying well, the tenants can't get this for free.",86,,
1196,0.97,6663.857,6669.562,We will be building their struggles.,86,,
1197,0.97,6669.562,6674.067,"Great, thank you so much for that report Councilmember Sawant.",87,,
1198,0.97,6674.067,6676.436,Any other questions or comments on that report?,87,,
1199,0.97,6676.436,6680.34,"Councilmember Herbold, the floor is yours.",87,,
1200,0.97,6680.34,6684.344,You are on mute.,87,,
1201,0.97,6684.344,6686.379,Sorry about that.,88,,
1202,0.97,6686.379,6694.587,"So, it's my understanding, although Councilmember Gonzalez, you of course have legislation that will be taking up later.",88,,
1203,0.97,6694.587,6703.096,"It's my understanding that the Mayor's Eviction order, addition moratorium order, isn't enforceable order.",88,,
1204,0.97,6703.096,6706.499,By the city attorney.,88,,
1205,0.97,6706.499,6712.806,As all emergency orders are actually enforceable by the city attorney.,88,,
1206,0.97,6712.806,6724.584,"There is language within the Eviction moratorium, emergency order, it doesn't get into sort of the Nitty-Gritty that Councilmember Gonzalez's proposed bill does.",88,,
1207,0.97,6724.584,6735.729,It certainly has language that says the property owner should work with tenants to enter into timed payment plans.,88,,
1208,0.97,6735.729,6750.21,"I'm wondering as it relates to the particular instance that you are sharing with us, Councilmember Sawant, whether or not you have sought the advice and assistance of the city attorney's office in enforcing the existing emergency order?",88,,
1209,0.97,6750.21,6755.048,"Thank you member, Councilmember Herbold.",89,,
1210,0.97,6755.048,6763.556,"I absolutely agree and we are actually, this all happened just over the weekend.",89,,
1211,0.97,6763.556,6766.025,We are going to be reaching out to the attorney's office.,89,,
1212,0.97,6766.025,6766.826,I totally agree with you.,89,,
1213,0.97,6766.826,6776.169,"It's quite disturbing that even though there is language that you just stated, that they owe--those orders are not being complied with by many of the landlords.",89,,
1214,0.97,6776.169,6788.782,"We heard from the Attorney General's office, not me personally, but we heard in the news from the Attorney General's office that they actually received nearly 300 complaints from various tenants across the state that the Eviction moratorium and the Rent-Free orders were not being complied with.",89,,
1215,0.97,6788.782,6801.361,"I'm also routinely hearing from tenants up on Capitol Hill and other neighborhoods, that they are receiving rent increase notices even though the state, you know the state order says that there shouldn't be any such thing.",89,,
1216,0.97,6801.361,6803.396,At least until June 4TH and maybe that will be extended.,89,,
1217,0.97,6803.396,6811.638,"So, I really agree that we should make sure that we do whatever enforcement as possible from the city council's perspective.",89,,
1218,0.97,6811.638,6813.373,I hope to have something positive to report sometime.,89,,
1219,0.97,6813.373,6818.211,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Herbold.",90,,
1220,0.97,6818.211,6824.918,"Of course, I have a couple quick bills that could help with this particular area as well.",90,,
1221,0.97,6824.918,6844.237,"So, I will be interested in Councilmember Sawant, your perspective and making sure the bills that we are going to Úconsider, I believe next Monday, are sort of fashioned in a way that will promote both enforcement and protection for these tenants.",90,,
1222,0.97,6844.237,6854.314,"I think we've been able to strike the right balance, and I think the scenario you are describing would in fact fall into the rubric of the existing draft ordinances.",90,,
1223,0.97,6854.314,6858.918,I want to make sure that we are hitting that nail on the head as well.,90,,
1224,0.97,6858.918,6863.356,Thanks a lot for highlighting that important facts.,90,,
1225,0.97,6863.356,6867.827,That is happening in real time.,90,,
1226,0.97,6867.827,6883.042,"And is exactly the reason why we needed the executive order, why we need the Attorney General's office, we are going to need our cities attorney's office doing enforcement and why I think the bills I'm advancing are absolutely complementary to the work that is happening.",90,,
1227,0.97,6883.042,6887.68,"So, any other questions or comments for Councilmember Sawant?",90,,
1228,0.97,6887.68,6892.785,"Hearing none, will move over to Councilmember Strauss.",90,,
1229,0.97,6892.785,6893.586,"Hi, good morning.",91,,
1230,0.97,6893.586,6895.588,We have about a half hour left in the morning.,91,,
1231,0.97,6895.588,6896.789,Good morning to everyone.,91,,
1232,0.97,6896.789,6900.159,I'm going to start with my general updates first.,91,,
1233,0.97,6900.159,6906.399,Will move into the Council bill because I believe that's where most people will have comments and conversation.,91,,
1234,0.97,6906.399,6913.506,I want to just say I've been following and tracking the market Streaking construction which was delayed and is now back on schedule.,91,,
1235,0.97,6913.506,6914.107,Amid this crisis.,91,,
1236,0.97,6914.107,6922.015,I want to complement S.For remaining on schedule during this process.,91,,
1237,0.97,6922.015,6930.323,"The Fremont arts Council, we are currently working with them to ensure that they are not displaced from their space that they rent from city lights.",91,,
1238,0.97,6930.323,6940.333,"As many have probably heard, the Fremont solstice parade has been canceled like so many other amazing events this year.",91,,
1239,0.97,6940.333,6952.412,"We want to make sure that they are able to stay in place this year as that is there one event . It's their largest event, not only event.",91,,
1240,0.97,6952.412,6956.082,"My office does continue to work with small, directly work with small businesses in our district and Nonprofits.",91,,
1241,0.97,6956.082,6968.127,"As you may have seen, my office circulated a small business letter that we intend to send to our State and Federal--thank you Councilmember Morales for your quick feedback.",91,,
1242,0.97,6968.127,6979.539,"I know that as we generate ideas that come from our communities, oftentimes there is already work underway to directly tackle the issues that people are facing.",91,,
1243,0.97,6979.539,6983.376,I continue to warn it with city Department to address the situation in and around Ballard Commons park.,91,,
1244,0.97,6983.376,6995.988,"Last week, the Ballard library branch--the bathrooms were opened there along with 95 new units of 24/7 enhanced shelter opened up in the city.",91,,
1245,0.97,6995.988,6996.989,That is for the entire city.,91,,
1246,0.97,6996.989,7007.7,"I will be interested to hear more about what we are doing to open more beds, and again, I call for urgency regarding this matter.",91,,
1247,0.97,7007.7,7020.913,I will now jump into the one Land-Use and neighborhoods committee related item on the agenda which of the reconsideration of Council bill 119769.,91,,
1248,0.97,7020.913,7028.421,Which is the emergency design we considered last week.,91,,
1249,0.97,7028.421,7034.994,This legislation is intended to allow projects to continue moving forward during the Covid- 19 emergency.,91,,
1250,0.97,7034.994,7037.43,There are two new amendments to the proposed legislation.,91,,
1251,0.97,7037.43,7044.704,I have asked Councilmembers to--not to include additional amendments that we have not discussed.,91,,
1252,0.97,7044.704,7050.81,One of those fits the--that criteria.,91,,
1253,0.97,7050.81,7057.55,"The two amendments, one is from Councilmember Morales, which is very similar to the amendment she brought forward last week.",91,,
1254,0.97,7057.55,7063.99,"This clarifies the language in important ways, and also fixes drafting errors.",91,,
1255,0.97,7063.99,7066.459,There was a lot going on last week.,91,,
1256,0.97,7066.459,7083.543,A lot of moving pieces and I appreciate Councilmember Morales' ability to come back and review this in great detail.,91,,
1257,0.97,7083.543,7085.278,Minor decisions in the International special review district.,91,,
1258,0.97,7085.278,7090.883,And remove the ability for the I SRD board to meet virtually for the next 60 days in response to community concerns.,91,,
1259,0.97,7090.883,7094.687,That is Councilmember Alice's amendment.,91,,
1260,0.97,7094.687,7109.902,It is different than the one proposed last week and clarifies some of the differences that was proposed last week as prepared to this week.,91,,
1261,0.97,7109.902,7125.585,Councilmember Lewis is also bringing an amendment that proposes to remove projects participating in the living building--at this time I would really prefer to only take up new amendments that have been discussed at prior Council meetings.,91,,
1262,0.97,7125.585,7129.822,Last week I laid out the urgency of adopting legislation quickly.,91,,
1263,0.97,7129.822,7135.194,So as not to worsen the housing and economic crisis we are experiencing.,91,,
1264,0.97,7135.194,7138.498,"And again, central staff is here on this call to answer any questions about the legislation.",91,,
1265,0.97,7138.498,7142.235,"Finally, there are no items from the language and neighborhoods community calendar.",91,,
1266,0.97,7142.235,7144.437,Thank you.,91,,
1267,0.97,7144.437,7156.415,"Thank you Councilmember Strauss, are there any comments or questions, or additional information related to Councilmember Strauss' report?",92,,
1268,0.97,7156.415,7168.861,"Okay, are there any questions for Council central staff as it relates to Council bill 119769?",92,,
1269,0.97,7168.861,7171.464,I think I got that number right.,92,,
1270,0.97,7171.464,7172.532,11--something.,92,,
1271,0.97,7172.532,7172.732,769.,92,,
1272,0.97,7172.732,7174.934,[Laughter],92,,
1273,0.97,7174.934,7179.238,"119769, you got it.",93,,
1274,0.97,7179.238,7180.773,"All right, I have to memorize it.",94,,
1275,0.97,7180.773,7182.074,I've been dreaming about it lately.,94,,
1276,0.97,7182.074,7187.28,Any questions for Council central staff on what we are going to consider this afternoon?,94,,
1277,0.97,7187.28,7191.184,Okay.,94,,
1278,0.97,7191.184,7195.388,"Councilmember Mosqueda, go for it.",94,,
1279,0.97,7195.388,7196.289,Beckel Council President.,95,,
1280,0.97,7196.289,7203.195,I want to thank Councilmember Strauss for his diligent work to help get this over the finish line today.,95,,
1281,0.97,7203.195,7207.066,"And the Council President, continuing to added to the agenda.",95,,
1282,0.97,7207.066,7207.466,Fingers crossed.,95,,
1283,0.97,7207.466,7209.302,Appreciate all your work.,95,,
1284,0.97,7209.302,7219.979,Is this the appropriate time Council President to a central staff questions about the amendments we have heard or should we save those for this afternoon?,95,,
1285,0.97,7219.979,7221.914,Council central staff will not be available this afternoon.,96,,
1286,0.97,7221.914,7231.724,"They are available now, and in the interim, but I will not be suspending the rules to allow Council central staff to answer any questions.",96,,
1287,0.97,7231.724,7245.938,"For colleagues, if you have any questions at all related to any prodigal legislation we are going to consider this afternoon, that would be most appropriately answered by either of them, now is the time to post those questions.",96,,
1288,0.97,7245.938,7250.509,If you want to do so on the record.,96,,
1289,0.97,7250.509,7251.51,Beckel Council President.,97,,
1290,0.97,7251.51,7254.947,Just a very brief question for central staff.,97,,
1291,0.97,7254.947,7257.149,I appreciate the Walk-Through of Councilmember Morales' amendment.,97,,
1292,0.97,7257.149,7261.153,I intend to fully support that.,97,,
1293,0.97,7261.153,7270.963,Thank you Councilmember Morales for your work as well to finalize that language and looking forward to that inclusion in the underlying bill.,97,,
1294,0.97,7270.963,7275.468,"Councilmember Lewis, I just do have a few questions for central staff I believe that would be most appropriate.",97,,
1295,0.97,7275.468,7277.97,I have a number of concerns with the language as I see it.,97,,
1296,0.97,7277.97,7293.653,"Just for the Council' as knowledge, and my understanding, if central staff could walk you through what a living building is by definition I think that would be a helpful reminder for folks.",97,,
1297,0.97,7293.653,7301.56,There is a pilot program called the living building.,98,,
1298,0.97,7301.56,7301.861,Challenge.,98,,
1299,0.97,7301.861,7306.999,Pilot.,98,,
1300,0.97,7306.999,7311.404,Buildings that have almost 0 emissions can qualify for extra floor area and Extralight.,98,,
1301,0.97,7311.404,7317.476,"As a matter of code, those buildings are required to go a full design review.",98,,
1302,0.97,7317.476,7323.215,"I review Councilmember Lewis' amendment, and you can speak to it.",98,,
1303,0.97,7323.215,7328.721,I think the one on the agenda today is the one I will describe.,98,,
1304,0.97,7328.721,7339.031,The version on the agenda today would exclude from the ability to elect administrative design review projects that are in the living building challenge.,98,,
1305,0.97,7339.031,7344.303,That have gone through a design guidance and applied for a mass use permit.,98,,
1306,0.97,7344.303,7353.546,Those are projects that have had more review already and are some ways down the road towards getting there mass use permit.,98,,
1307,0.97,7353.546,7356.549,There are about 15 total projects that are in the living building pilot now.,98,,
1308,0.97,7356.549,7361.554,About five are probably at some stage of design review at this point.,98,,
1309,0.97,7361.554,7371.564,It's likely that Councilmember Lewis's would affect 3 of 5 of those projects.,98,,
1310,0.97,7371.564,7373.966,"Any follow-up, Councilmember Mosqueda?",99,,
1311,0.97,7373.966,7375.234,No.,100,,
1312,0.97,7375.234,7378.337,Thank you very much Council President.,100,,
1313,0.97,7378.337,7392.952,"Councilmember Lewis, did you want to address your Amendatory language before I call him Councilmember Herbold who Icu is raising her hand?",101,,
1314,0.97,7392.952,7393.219,Sure.,102,,
1315,0.97,7393.219,7396.021,I was going to name the Reserve mentioning it into my presentation later.,102,,
1316,0.97,7396.021,7401.46,I can just jump in really quickly now.,102,,
1317,0.97,7401.46,7410.903,"So as was just shared, of the 15 projects that are under the living building challenge, and to be clear, I'm a very strong supporter of that pilot.",102,,
1318,0.97,7410.903,7415.207,I'm really excited that we have 15 projects that are in that pilot and taking advantage of it.,102,,
1319,0.97,7415.207,7417.51,Three of those projects would be impacted by this amendment.,102,,
1320,0.97,7417.51,7434.593,"The basis for pursuing the amendment is under the living building project, a considerable density of height bonus is allowed to buildings which is good.",102,,
1321,0.97,7434.593,7437.73,It's a good incentive for people to participate in the project.,102,,
1322,0.97,7437.73,7445.805,"The downside of that is the design review, becomes a bigger issue when we are talking about bigger height or bigger bulk.",102,,
1323,0.97,7445.805,7455.948,"In the case of projects that haven't started their design review yet, so, they would go to the administrative process, I don't think it's as big of a deal.",102,,
1324,0.97,7455.948,7461.787,That would be how the entire process would be conducted for those buildings.,102,,
1325,0.97,7461.787,7479.171,"But for the buildings that have already started their design review process and have their initial presentations to the board, had initial input and set an additional meeting to come back for final board approval, to send the project on to get the master use permit.",102,,
1326,0.97,7479.171,7493.385,"There is a lot of concern from people in the community that a lot of the great progress made at that initial board hearing is going to get lost between the initial hearing, and then the final one for the final court approval.",102,,
1327,0.97,7493.385,7509.435,"So, for that reason, I think it's reasonable given that these particularly builder buildings that a lot of the other buildings that we face as a city, to go through the master unit, master use permit process, and that we have three of these projects that are midstream.",102,,
1328,0.97,7509.435,7513.706,So they've had their initial design review board process from an in person board.,102,,
1329,0.97,7513.706,7517.209,And they need to come back for approval from the same folks that are the initial presentation.,102,,
1330,0.97,7517.209,7527.786,"It's reasonable to expect that those projects that are midstream and halfway through that process, should be expected to go back and finish it the way those projects started.",102,,
1331,0.97,7527.786,7533.492,"So, that's the amendment that I put forward.",102,,
1332,0.97,7533.492,7543.002,"I'm happy to answer any questions now during my presentation, or at this afternoon's council meeting.",102,,
1333,0.97,7543.002,7548.641,That's what that amendment deals with.,102,,
1334,0.97,7548.641,7550.509,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,103,,
1335,0.97,7550.509,7561.654,"I think what I would like to do, is request that Councilmembers not Reserve their comments about anything related to this bill and tell their report.",103,,
1336,0.97,7561.654,7580.773,"If you have something related to this Council bill, I'm asking Councilmembers to address those issues, questions, comments, concerns related to anything on this bill now, during Councilmember Strauss' report.",103,,
1337,0.97,7580.773,7585.377,I appreciate your willingness to talk about it now.,103,,
1338,0.97,7585.377,7602.161,Anything to add for us to consider as it relates to Councilmember Lewis' amendment which is listed on our agenda for later on this afternoon?,103,,
1339,0.97,7602.161,7604.096,Nothing from me.,104,,
1340,0.97,7604.096,7608.167,Okay.,105,,
1341,0.97,7608.167,7616.308,"Councilmember, Strauss, did you want to address this month amendment as Proposedby Councilmember Lewis.",105,,
1342,0.97,7616.308,7619.612,"Yes, I would just say I think this they well thought out amendment.",106,,
1343,0.97,7619.612,7623.215,That is narrowly defined.,106,,
1344,0.97,7623.215,7645.337,"I do echo the comments that I made just a few minutes ago that new and emerging issues that have been identified since our meeting last week, I would prefer to keep the bill narrowly tailored to get it across the finish line today rather than bring up and address new issues.",106,,
1345,0.97,7645.337,7649.541,"So, I appreciate Councilmember Lewis bringing the amendment.",106,,
1346,0.97,7649.541,7653.545,And I would prefer to keep the bill as limited as possible.,106,,
1347,0.97,7653.545,7655.047,Thank you.,106,,
1348,0.97,7655.047,7658.917,"So, Councilmember Strauss, I'm not following what you're trying to signal to me.",107,,
1349,0.97,7658.917,7663.856,I'd rather not read or interpret Subtext to your comments.,107,,
1350,0.97,7663.856,7674.967,"Are you, as the prime sponsor of the bill, have you identified Councilmembers amendment to version 2, and a new issue, and therefore are not supporting it?",107,,
1351,0.97,7674.967,7677.469,I will not be voting for the amendment.,108,,
1352,0.97,7677.469,7682.441,"I have discussed this with Councilmember Lewis, and I welcomed him in bringing the amendment forward.",108,,
1353,0.97,7682.441,7686.178,Despite not voting for it.,108,,
1354,0.97,7686.178,7700.993,"Okay, and I gets him trying to get a sense from you of whether you as a prime sponsor of this bill believe that this amendment is what you characterized in your opening remarks to be--that it is fairly characterized as a new issue?",109,,
1355,0.97,7700.993,7703.262,That is how I would characterize it as.,110,,
1356,0.97,7703.262,7710.836,I want to complement Councilmember Lewis on his ability to work with his constituency.,110,,
1357,0.97,7710.836,7717.276,And for convincing me of the necessity of bringing this forward.,110,,
1358,0.97,7717.276,7720.245,"I want to commend his good work, however I will not be supporting the amendment.",110,,
1359,0.97,7720.245,7720.779,Okay.,111,,
1360,0.97,7720.779,7728.52,Any other questions or comments on Councilmember Lewis' amendment?,111,,
1361,0.97,7728.52,7732.524,"Councilmember Mosqueda, the floor is yours.",111,,
1362,0.97,7732.524,7733.525,Thank you so much.,112,,
1363,0.97,7733.525,7744.103,"Councilmember Lewis, I think that what the chair, or what the sponsor is saying is that he appreciates how much you dig into the details and try to find a come forward.",112,,
1364,0.97,7744.103,7748.941,And I'll complement you on that as well.,112,,
1365,0.97,7748.941,7755.447,"I want to be explicit with our colleagues here, and the public, I will also not be supporting this amendment.",112,,
1366,0.97,7755.447,7765.824,I think that it's really important that we lift up projects like these that we just heard from central staff are exactly the types of project we want to see go forward.,112,,
1367,0.97,7765.824,7770.629,The importance of having buildings that are showing that our living buildings pilot is going to be successful.,112,,
1368,0.97,7770.629,7771.964,"Again, zero emissions.",112,,
1369,0.97,7771.964,7782.074,"Make sure that we include a design that is not just think about setbacks or green roots, that are truly living buildings.",112,,
1370,0.97,7782.074,7785.577,This is an example we want to set forward and show how successful this pilot can be.,112,,
1371,0.97,7785.577,7788.78,I also think it's important for us to reiterate this later this afternoon.,112,,
1372,0.97,7788.78,7799.491,That we don't fold into a false Mayor said that this takes away the community's ability to engage in this process with the administrative element.,112,,
1373,0.97,7799.491,7810.903,We are going to be also included community feedback and working with the departments as fast as possible stand up other ways to the community to stay engaged.,112,,
1374,0.97,7810.903,7817.81,"This living building pilot even three out of the 15, give us the opportunity to move forward in this time.",112,,
1375,0.97,7817.81,7836.728,"I don't want us to do anything that could unintentionally cause any of those developers to say, if there's going to be the possibility of delay, then I'm going to abandon the limiting building at and move forward with the building as normal.",112,,
1376,0.97,7836.728,7843.602,For me this is really making sure that those living buildings move forward and there's not an unintended consequences somebody decided to abandon those elements because we want these living buildings to be successful.,112,,
1377,0.97,7843.602,7853.745,"I just I want to make sure and I'll talk about it later today, that folks know that there could be opportunities for Flks to engage in the that is data process and beyond very soon.",112,,
1378,0.97,7853.745,7882.574,"This is not about taking away community voice this is about making sure we are integrating it in ways that have been allowed by law and that we are encouraging the creation of these living buildings and not unintentionally having folks default into an Nonliving building construction . So, thank you for I think working with the sponsor to try to merit, but again I'll be voting no on this amendment when it comes forward today.",112,,
1379,0.97,7882.574,7885.544,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda.,113,,
1380,0.97,7885.544,7889.548,I want to see if there were any other comments on Councilmember Lewis' proposed amendment.,113,,
1381,0.97,7889.548,7897.856,"And if there are, none then I'm going to move over to Councilmember Strauss who is still in the Queue.",113,,

1383,0.97,7899.491,7902.995,Thank you.,115,,
1384,0.97,7902.995,7923.482,I just want to highlight why I'm not bringing back my amendment that would strike the section of the bill that allows affordable housing projects to be exempt from the streamlined administrative design process that they are already entitled to participate in.,115,,
1385,0.97,7923.482,7946.838,"I'm not bringing this amendment forward because of--requirement of our parliamentary procedures that does not allow the Nonprevailing party, as it relates to an amendment, to bring back the same amendment.",115,,
1386,0.97,7946.838,7952.444,"We thought about whether or not there was a way to make a change to the amendment, the amendment itself as it was drafted.",115,,
1387,0.97,7952.444,7958.55,Included striking the recycle as well as striking the action portion.,115,,
1388,0.97,7958.55,7960.552,Within the bill itself.,115,,
1389,0.97,7960.552,7971.563,"I thought about taking, or not including the striking of the recital, and just moving forward with the removal of the exemption.",115,,
1390,0.97,7971.563,7979.871,"But did not feel that that would pass sort of the smell test of you, my colleagues.",115,,
1391,0.97,7979.871,7990.882,"On the Council because as I understand it from the city clerk, it is the body of the city Council, the body who decides whether or not the amendment is the same question.",115,,
1392,0.97,7990.882,8010.102,"I felt if I was in your shoes, and I was considering an amendment that was identical, except for the recital section, but still have the same impact, that I would decide that that was not a different question.",115,,
1393,0.97,8010.102,8012.904,That's the reason why I'm not bringing this amendment forward again.,115,,
1394,0.97,8012.904,8013.505,Thank you.,115,,
1395,0.97,8013.505,8017.709,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for that explanation.",116,,
1396,0.97,8017.709,8039.998,I think it's super important to again use our Council briefings in a way that will promote as much transparency to the work that we are doing on Council . Since we don't have the benefit of having our ordinary community central.,116,,
1397,0.97,8039.998,8042.834,I really appreciate your all's willingness to have these conversations in Council briefings.,116,,
1398,0.97,8042.834,8046.538,I know it adds to the length of our Council briefings.,116,,
1399,0.97,8046.538,8065.223,I know I think it's really an important part of how we are doing our work within the context of this period of pandemic and crisis to make sure that we are still fulfilling the obligation to share as much information around our work in a public setting.,116,,
1400,0.97,8065.223,8067.526,Really appreciate it.,116,,
1401,0.97,8067.526,8078.837,"Okay, so any, questions or comments related to Council mumble Herbold's comments?",116,,
1402,0.97,8078.837,8090.782,"Hearing none, I'm going to move over to Councilmember Morales, who has an amendment and want to provide her an opportunity to address them amendment briefly.",116,,
1403,0.97,8090.782,8101.993,Then I'll ask them to add any additional details for the Council to consider.,116,,
1404,0.97,8101.993,8106.298,Then we'll have a quick little conversation on that and hopefully be able to wrap up this report.,116,,
1405,0.97,8106.298,8107.466,"Councilmember Morales, the floor is yours.",116,,

1408,0.97,8120.645,8126.818,That would prohibit virtual meetings of the Isr keyboard.,117,,
1409,0.97,8126.818,8133.492,"As Councilmember Strauss mentioned, we have been having lots of conversations with folks in the Cid.",117,,
1410,0.97,8133.492,8140.932,The real crux of the matter for them is this deep desire not to move to virtual meetings.,117,,
1411,0.97,8140.932,8156.648,When so many people in the community lack access to technology and we can't be sure about how quickly we'll be able to put the language and purposes services in place.,117,,
1412,0.97,8156.648,8160.652,That's what we will be proposing this afternoon.,117,,

1416,0.97,8175.534,8183.575,Not just a district specific impact.,118,,
1417,0.97,8183.575,8196.788,And really do appreciate your willingness to continue to work with the primary sponsor around finding an appropriate path forward that is you know sort of needed enough to address concerns.,118,,

1503,0.97,8772.13,8777.435,I started hearing from constituents immediately about the Boarded-Up benches.,130,,

1629,0.97,9475.065,9484.641,"If there are changes people want to see, to please be in touch with my office and hopefully we can circulate and update a letter by this afternoon.",134,,
1630,0.97,9484.641,9489.379,Or on a Timeline that Council President deems appropriate.,134,,
1631,0.97,9489.379,9503.494,The second letter being distributed is a letter supporting the organizing of the fellows and residents at the University of Washington medical school.,134,,

1636,0.97,9539.296,9543.0,This is a very specific ask for our Federal delegation.,134,,
1637,0.97,9543.0,9545.168,I have shared this office with the office of Intergovernmental relations.,134,,
1638,0.97,9545.168,9547.237,As well for their feedback.,134,,
1639,0.97,9547.237,9549.239,This is a very simple ask.,134,,
1640,0.97,9549.239,9553.143,It's to raise the unemployment insurance reimbursement rate.,134,,
1641,0.97,9553.143,9570.427,A lot of these Nonprofits pay a significant amount into their unemployment insurance and have to pay out of unemployment insurance at a higher rate due to the nature and structure of how they are insured.,134,,
1642,0.97,9570.427,9582.906,The request is to have the Feds from currently where it stands at 50% under the last C.A.R.E.S.,134,,
1643,0.97,9582.906,9584.775,Act to 100% just given the unprecedented nature of Covid- 19.,134,,
1644,0.97,9584.775,9602.092,"And that they say are unique layoffs in that they are--not that they are putting people on employment, not because of the anticipated fluctuations in the business cycle or what have you.",134,,
1645,0.97,9602.092,9611.401,But B has a Covid pandemic uniquely Obliterates their ability to to do anything within the model of how those organizations are organized.,134,,
1646,0.97,9611.401,9615.806,Particularly around live performances.,134,,
1647,0.97,9615.806,9617.841,"So, that letter would be addressed to our Federal delegation.",134,,
1648,0.97,9617.841,9621.111,"Like I said, I've shared it to get feedback.",134,,
1649,0.97,9621.111,9625.682,I've distributed it to Council colleagues.,134,,
1650,0.97,9625.682,9629.686,Any feedback folks have on that would appreciate receiving it.,134,,

1656,0.97,9670.16,9678.869,History in the community and it's hopefully going to produce some really good ideas and recommendations heading into the fall.,134,,
1657,0.97,9678.869,9683.94,"With that, I don't have any additional comments.",134,,
1658,0.97,9683.94,9687.377,"Wait, no, sorry, one more shout out.",134,,
1659,0.97,9687.377,9693.283,I just want to give shout out to a great organization in my district.,134,,

1661,0.97,9697.554,9700.357,All on zoom.,134,,
1662,0.97,9700.357,9704.795,It is just a really great example of how some groups in the city are really adapting in a really powerful way.,134,,
1663,0.97,9704.795,9706.563,If I far puts our zoo meetings to shame.,134,,
1664,0.97,9706.563,9713.804,To watch a full Shakespeare play on zoom as the medium.,134,,
1665,0.97,9713.804,9715.005,I was really impressed by it.,134,,
1666,0.97,9715.005,9716.807,I understand we will probably be doing future performances.,134,,
1667,0.97,9716.807,9740.831,Just going to improve members of the public and Council colleagues to make sure their tuning in and supporting Seattle theater company and encourage other groups to provide similar adaptations to their way of providing services and performances to make sure that the damage to a sector that has been hit especially hard can be somehow mitigated.,134,,
1668,0.97,9740.831,9742.332,Thank you so much.,134,,

1671,0.97,9758.248,9766.022,To sort of go through a rollcall process and just get those squared away during Council briefing.,135,,
1672,0.97,9766.022,9770.127,I'm waiting to get some clarification from the clerk via Email before I ventured down that path.,135,,
1673,0.97,9770.127,9775.932,Let's go ahead and continue for now through reports.,135,,
1674,0.97,9775.932,9779.436,Any questions or comments on Councilmember Lewis's report?,135,,

1684,0.97,9822.679,9824.681,Even if you can't vote on it in committee.,136,,
1685,0.97,9824.681,9836.493,I think that is a way for us to be able to manage with our new Council rules and still allow members to lead the conversation about Bia's in their own district.,136,,

1816,0.97,10516.305,10523.012,We will see what may brings us in terms of being able to have additional committee hearings are not.,146,,
1817,0.97,10523.012,10539.695,"Really quickly, just wanted to make sure folks were aware that the governor's proclamation around health and public meetings act, and engaging only in business that is Covid related, a routine and necessary has been extended to may 4TH.",146,,
1818,0.97,10539.695,10550.039,"So, we will continue to hold off on having other types of business come before the Council until at least may 4TH.",146,,
1819,0.97,10550.039,10566.956,I am currently working with the law Department and the clerk's office on identifying what occurs if the proclamation related to the open Covid meeting act is not extended beyond may 4TH.,146,,
1820,0.97,10566.956,10578.267,"But, the governor's stay home, stay healthy order is extended beyond may 4TH, and sort of what happens in that period of time when we don't have an extension of a proclamation.",146,,
1821,0.97,10578.267,10588.077,"I'm not saying I know that's not--that is not going to be renewed, but I want us to be prepared in terms of our operations in the event that that does occur.",146,,
1822,0.97,10588.077,10614.303,"As I mentioned last week, the governor's proclamation around providing cities like the city of Seattle some relief from open public meetings act in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, that is a bipartisan approved decision and requires all the majority and minority leaders of the state Legislature to agree to an extension of those proclamations.",146,,
1823,0.97,10614.303,10618.107,To the proclamation itself.,146,,
1824,0.97,10618.107,10631.12,"So, we will continue to engage with the governor's office to identify what we can anticipate happening on May 4TH . hopefully we'll know more before then, because that is exactly 7 days from today.",146,,
1825,0.97,10631.12,10632.488,"So, there you have it.",146,,
1826,0.97,10632.488,10645.001,"Next, I want to, I have one item on this afternoon's introduction referral Candida that is Council bill 119784 relating to Renter assistance legislation that I introduced and I have previously discussed.",146,,
1827,0.97,10645.001,10652.041,This legislation is accompanied by Council bill 119783.,146,,
1828,0.97,10652.041,10662.952,"Related to creating a defense to Evictions, that occur within six months after the termination of the Eviction moratorium issued by the Mayor.",146,,
1829,0.97,10662.952,10678.034,"So, we are introducing Council bill 119784, in light of the governor Inslee's recent executive order on this topic, so, we made some I think minor modifications to that bill.",146,,
1830,0.97,10678.034,10685.808,"So, my hope is that we will be able to call those two bills to a vote full council next week, next Monday during our council meeting.",146,,
1831,0.97,10685.808,10689.545,Which is may 5th.,146,,
1832,0.97,10689.545,10697.953,"Next, I am also, have another item on this afternoon's item.",146,,
1833,0.97,10697.953,10711.901,"Item number nine, that is appointment 1583, which is the appointment of our very own a Councilmember Lewis as the chair of the Workgroup for the performance audience . I expect this appointment is going to sail right through.",146,,
1834,0.97,10711.901,10726.315,"But, I just wanted to make sure that folks were aware that I have asked Councilmember Lewis, and Councilmember Lewis, has agreed to leave that Workgroup and really have appreciated his engagement with me and my office in January about the interest in this body of work.",146,,
1835,0.97,10726.315,10731.821,"And appreciate his willingness to again, leave that body of work to its conclusion.",146,,
1836,0.97,10731.821,10733.722,Looking forward to that.,146,,
1837,0.97,10733.722,10740.529,"Not, I wanted to, that's it on the formal agenda.",146,,
1838,0.97,10740.529,10761.951,"I wanted to provide folks, a heads up that I will be walking on a resolution this afternoon to ratify the Mayor's most recent executive order related to capping delivery service fees on--that are being sort of passed on to many of our local restaurants.",146,,
1839,0.97,10761.951,10768.657,"As we know, many of our beloved main street restaurants are just reeling from this economic crisis.",146,,
1840,0.97,10768.657,10777.533,And exhibited delivery service charges are further threatening their abilities to work through this pandemic to reduce the economic storm.,146,,
1841,0.97,10777.533,10780.369,Restaurant owners across the Idaho and adopted their,146,,
1842,0.97,10780.369,10787.877,Thousands of industry workers and even thinner margins for these important small businesses.,147,,
1843,0.97,10787.877,10802.291,"With tight margins every dollar paid to an act based delivery service is quite literally a dollar taken away from our local restaurant, economy, and our workforce.",147,,
1844,0.97,10802.291,10810.399,We know some of these corporations are closing and inflated fees and in some cases those fees can be as high as 42% and these businesses are directly profiting from this crisis.,147,,
1845,0.97,10810.399,10817.807,On the backs of our main street businesses.,147,,
1846,0.97,10817.807,10833.189,"We cannot allow that to happen, and this executive order will provide much-needed relief and establish a system that is more fair and equitable to our restaurants who do not have the tools or Positional power to negotiate these contracts with these Behemoth corporations like Uber eats, door dash, and caviar.",147,,
1847,0.97,10833.189,10839.795,"This afternoon I'll be walking on a resolution to ratify the emergency order issued by Mayor Durkan on Friday, capping restaurant delivery and pick up these.",147,,
1848,0.97,10839.795,10851.841,It was circulated on Friday afternoon in accordance with Council roles for consideration this afternoon.,147,,
1849,0.97,10851.841,10858.147,"It has been reviewed and found to not infringe on any residents of the liberties, and that the Mayor does indeed have the authority to issue this order as currently drafted.",147,,
1850,0.97,10858.147,10863.852,"So, I have also received some correspondence from our friends in the labor and worker advocate arena.",147,,
1851,0.97,10863.852,10878.534,"About wanting to see if there's an opportunity to also protect workers, many folks who rely on these delivery of service Apps to be able to make their livelihood.",147,,
1852,0.97,10878.534,10882.972,Are nervous and anxious that this cap will impact them.,147,,
1853,0.97,10882.972,10905.594,"One of the critical parts of the executive order that was really important to me, was to make sure that the executive order included language that it would be prohibited and unlawful for any of these commissions or caps to impact the earnings of delivery workers.",147,,
1854,0.97,10905.594,10926.882,"So, the bulk of that language is I believe on page 4 of the executive order which provides that it shall be unlawful for a third-party App based food delivery platform to reduce the compensation rates to a service delivery driver or garnish Gratuities as a result of this going into effect during the duration of this order.",147,,
1855,0.97,10926.882,10955.711,"So, as a Councilmember who has been here since 2015, who has literally worked on some type of a labor standard, or lead on some type of a labor standard, every year that I have been in office, it is obviously extremely important to me to make sure that anything related to this executive order isn't going to have the unintended consequence of negatively Impacting folks who are currently doing these deliveries and that's a really important principle to me.",147,,
1856,0.97,10955.711,10979.034,"I will continue to work with those advocates and our labor allies in that space to see if there is an opportunity, a related opportunity, for us to either have emergency type of legislation, that is related to any impacts to this segment of the worker population as a relates to the Covid-19 crisis.",147,,
1857,0.97,10979.034,11000.823,"And, or, look at some additional language for this executive order for us to consider this afternoon that would make sure that we are not allowing these companies to for example, cut off parts of the city to delivery drivers in order to maximize their own profits.",147,,
1858,0.97,11000.823,11019.208,"Again, the principal for me is to make sure that we are going to continue to support folks who are working in this gig economy . My hope is that we'll be able to--some additional language.",147,,
1859,0.97,11019.208,11027.416,To include in the executive order that would be appropriate to do so under executive authority.,147,,
1860,0.97,11027.416,11049.505,"If it's not appropriate to do so under executive authority, certainly having a conversation with you all, and others about how we can have a Standalone body of work that would meet the needs of this particular segment of workers in our city who are also seeing huge impacts from the Covid-19 crisis.",147,,
1861,0.97,11049.505,11052.541,Would be something that I am committed to and interested in doing.,147,,
1862,0.97,11052.541,11059.048,"So, that is what I would like to say about the executive order for this afternoon.",147,,
1863,0.97,11059.048,11065.154,I want to thank Mayor Durkan for her willingness to engage with me on this issue.,147,,
1864,0.97,11065.154,11076.765,I took great interest in this particular issue after having a conversation with the owner of a coffee shop in West Seattle that I go to.,147,,
1865,0.97,11076.765,11081.17,It's a rather new coffee shop.,147,,
1866,0.97,11081.17,11092.381,"Lula, and it is owned by two bad as women who have been working really hard to bring this community centered coffee shop into the junction.",147,,
1867,0.97,11092.381,11106.395,"When she told me that they get charged 30% of the price of a cup of coffee, to be delivered, that was atrocious to me.",147,,
1868,0.97,11106.395,11109.898,Shortly after that conversation I saw that the Mayor of San Francisco issued her executive order around this.,147,,
1869,0.97,11109.898,11121.009,We quickly engaged the Mayor about to or 2 1/2 weeks ago around the possibility of also doing the same here.,147,,
1870,0.97,11121.009,11124.713,And have really appreciated her partnership and her willingness to use her executive authority in this manner.,147,,
1871,0.97,11124.713,11130.986,I also want to thank Councilmember Herbold who has been a partner on this effort as well.,147,,
1872,0.97,11130.986,11140.696,Who has I believe some additional words to add to this resolution that we'll be considering this afternoon and the executive order as a whole.,147,,
1873,0.97,11140.696,11141.23,Councilmember Herbold.,147,,
1874,0.97,11141.23,11156.945,"I want to just first start off with thanks to the West Seattle Chamber of Commerce sue very much like the experience that you had Councilmember Gonzalez, Council President, Gonzalez.",148,,
1875,0.97,11156.945,11159.648,With the owners of lulu.,148,,
1876,0.97,11159.648,11168.357,"Very quickly, upon hearing about the action in San Francisco, reached out to me.",148,,
1877,0.97,11168.357,11170.559,In asking why not Seattle as well?,148,,
1878,0.97,11170.559,11178.066,We should move forward with a cap on these commissions.,148,,
1879,0.97,11178.066,11187.276,"That are really, these Commission charges that are really just taking advantage of the state of emergency that we are all in and our reliance on these food delivery Apps.",148,,
1880,0.97,11187.276,11190.479,"So, thank you to the West Seattle Chamber.",148,,
1881,0.97,11190.479,11195.183,Thank you as well Council President Gonzalez for your fast action on this.,148,,
1882,0.97,11195.183,11200.889,"By the time I had reached out to you, you had already talked to the Mayor, about that.",148,,
1883,0.97,11200.889,11207.162,"So, my message to the Mayor was just reinforcing the interest.",148,,
1884,0.97,11207.162,11220.309,I really thank you for getting the wheels moving and also want to thank you for your commitment here to address some of the labor standard issues associated with these Apps.,148,,
1885,0.97,11220.309,11229.518,Specifically the requests from workers to look at a hazard pay surcharge for deliveries.,148,,
1886,0.97,11229.518,11236.825,"Or, a parallel Commission cap on the share of delivery fees and service charges that an App can take from the worker providing the service.",148,,
1887,0.97,11236.825,11244.733,I think one or both of those avenues are very worthy of discussion and appreciate your commitment to do so here.,148,,
1888,0.97,11244.733,11245.334,Thank you.,148,,
1889,0.97,11245.334,11246.335,I couldn't agree more.,149,,
1890,0.97,11246.335,11254.243,I think those are reasonable paths to pursue.,149,,
1891,0.97,11254.243,11266.655,"And for transparency, stake in terms of how we are structuring the executive order, I wanted this executive order to be clean and narrowly focused on the third-party fees being charged directly to restaurants.",149,,
1892,0.97,11266.655,11276.264,But also thinking that there would be an opportunity to address the labor standards issue you have articulated in a different path.,149,,
1893,0.97,11276.264,11285.507,"And I believe, and I hope we can do so fairly quickly as I think all of us have that sense of urgency around making sure that we are providing the appropriate protections.",149,,
1894,0.97,11285.507,11301.99,"Not just for Restauranteur's, but also for people who are the Connectors, which are the gig economy workers who are relying on business from these delivery Apps to continue to survive.",149,,
1895,0.97,11301.99,11304.092,"So, I'm certainly interested in working on that.",149,,
1896,0.97,11304.092,11309.898,I also want to give a quick little shout out to the Seattle restaurants United.,149,,
1897,0.97,11309.898,11316.104,This is an organization that has sort of the organically formed over the last few weeks.,149,,
1898,0.97,11316.104,11320.308,It's an organization made up of independently owned local restaurants and bars.,149,,
1899,0.97,11320.308,11322.31,Here in the city of Seattle.,149,,
1900,0.97,11322.31,11339.828,They have over 200 people who have signed up . 200 entities who have signed up to be part of the coalition.,149,,
1901,0.97,11354.109,11367.055,They are all just some examples of the folks who are part of that coalition who have sent us an Email as of this morning at 5:40 A.M.,149,,
1902,0.97,11367.055,11379.634,Saying that they are appreciative of this executive order . are excited to see its quick action and want to send us a thank you and a letter of support.,149,,
1903,0.97,11379.634,11385.474,Have also indicated that they recognize the impacts to third- party delivery drivers.,149,,
1904,0.97,11385.474,11390.979,Particularly as it regards to Accessing Restrooms as they are doing deliveries.,149,,
1905,0.97,11390.979,11394.382,They are publicly made a commitment to allow third-party drivers to access the Restrooms in their establishments.,149,,
1906,0.97,11394.382,11396.885,To ensure public health and safety.,149,,
1907,0.97,11396.885,11401.89,They are Eagle to get to work with us.,149,,
1908,0.97,11401.89,11411.5,And the coalition members to figure out how to meet that particular need which was surfaced up in some of our conversations with those folks.,149,,
1909,0.97,11411.5,11415.17,I think there is a lot of work that can be done on that labor standards piece.,149,,
1910,0.97,11415.17,11421.209,I am committed to do that work and I think is not--I hope folks don't see this as an Either/Or option.,149,,
1911,0.97,11421.209,11425.914,But sort of a Holistic approach that we can take with this executive order going through first.,149,,
1912,0.97,11425.914,11438.326,"And the second one, if it's an executive order or Standalone emergency legislation coming very, very quickly next.",149,,
1913,0.97,11438.326,11440.162,"So, that is all I have on my report.",149,,
1914,0.97,11440.162,11442.731,Happy to answer any questions or hear any comments.,149,,
1915,0.97,11442.731,11445.534,"All right, well, thank you all.",149,,
