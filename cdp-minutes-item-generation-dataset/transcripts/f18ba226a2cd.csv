616,0.7694960236549377,2864.1,2883.4,That was recommended because the name that was originally constituted was very similar to another fund that is in CBO and they were concerned that there could be accounting errors where money would be accidentally deposited in the other homelessness fund and to avoid that.,,,
617,0.7694960236549377,2883.4,2885.4,"They wanted a very, very distinct name.",,,

639,0.8963465094566345,2976.6,2980.2,"And that section, you'll note that it also refers to the Director of Finance.",,,
640,0.8963465094566345,2980.7,2988.8,It was clarified for me that some of those pieces should be directed to the department that actually implement the programs and have oversight over the spending.,,,
641,0.8963465094566345,2988.8,2990.8,Whereas other pieces should go to the Director of Finance.,,,

742,0.9004051089286804,3420.1,3422.1,"And eventually, those funds came to the city.",,,
743,0.9004051089286804,3422.1,3425.4,They are available until September 30th of 2022.,,,
744,0.9004051089286804,3425.4,3430.4,And you can see in the last column where these Investments have been stood up.,,,
745,0.9004051089286804,3430.4,3434.3,So the hotel room surges are going to be spoken to later.,,,
746,0.9004051089286804,3434.3,3435.7,So I won't go into detail on those.,,,
747,0.9004051089286804,3435.7,3442.7,The enhanced shelter one of the shuttle shelter that was existing has been converted to being a 24-hour operations.,,,
748,0.9004051089286804,3442.7,3447.8,So that's the 60 beds being discussed there and then you'll see that rapid.,,,
749,0.8755791187286377,3448.0,3450.6, Housing the next to last line.,,,
750,0.8755791187286377,3450.8,3453.2,That is actually a surge again with USG money.,,,
751,0.8755791187286377,3453.2,3457.7,"Yes, you covid money that has been awarded and fully encumbered by Nature.",,,
752,0.8755791187286377,3457.7,3465.2,That program wouldn't have full the expended all of its funds but it is operational and that will also be covered by the executive shortly.,,,
753,0.8755791187286377,3465.2,3474.7,"And then last but not least, you can see that there were two ordinances one that initially provided funds, this last March and then it was amended by the council.",,,
754,0.8755791187286377,3474.8,3477.7,Just recently in June to provide.,,,
755,0.9004349112510681,3477.9,3496.3," Twelve million dollars in additional funding for shelter, three million dollars of that was actually directed to the law enforcement, assisted diversion program, which over the last year, has in many ways operated as co-lead, which has utilized the access to hotels to support people that require a diversion services.",,,
756,0.9004349112510681,3496.4,3501.5,"And so that's why that is fully noted there is or noted there in the notes, but only listed as 9 million dollars.",,,
757,0.7913491129875183,3502.7,3505.9, There's not any questions about the totals of the items listed here.,,,
758,0.7913491129875183,3505.9,3508.1,"I'll move to the next slide, but I'll pause for questions.",,,
759,0.7913491129875183,3508.6,3509.0,Jeff.,,,
760,0.7913491129875183,3509.0,3512.7,I have a few questions just to make sure we have,,,
761,0.8491194248199463,3514.4,3515.8, the clear bottom line here.,,,
762,0.8491194248199463,3515.8,3517.9,I also want to take advantage of this opportunity.,,,
763,0.8491194248199463,3517.9,3521.4,"Holding the floor to announce the councilmember, her bold has rejoined.",,,
764,0.8491194248199463,3521.4,3526.1,"The meeting good to have you back councilmember her bold, good to see you here.",,,
765,0.8491194248199463,3527.6,3529.2,So just a clarification.,,,
766,0.8491194248199463,3529.2,3529.9,Can you?,,,
767,0.8491194248199463,3529.9,3532.9,And maybe we can ask hsd this later but I'll ask you first.,,,
768,0.8491194248199463,3533.8,3540.3,What's the nature of the 230 rapid rehousing units in terms of counting it as a better unit added.,,,
769,0.8130977749824524,3541.0,3557.6," Are those like separate rooms, Catholic community services, has hung onto, or are they are those two hundred thirty units that are out in the market somewhere that that we have, like a subsidy that is supporting folks.",,,
770,0.8130977749824524,3557.6,3561.6,"For, you know, the 12 months of support in that program.",,,
771,0.8130977749824524,3562.1,3563.5,It would be the latter of what you said.,,,
772,0.8130977749824524,3563.5,3570.5,So rapid rehousing is typically a model where an individual is ass or a household or is assisted in,,,
773,0.896064281463623,3570.6,3574.6, Creating a rental unit that's appropriate for their placement and King County.,,,
774,0.896064281463623,3574.6,3581.8,"We utilize the housing connector for a believe, nearly all if not all of identifying, landlords and units that are available.",,,
775,0.896064281463623,3581.8,3595.9,"And then in this case, it's Catholic community services and the Chief Seattle club that actually have the contracts to provide the the rental support during the period that the household is enrolled as well as the services that will correlate with being enrolled in the program.",,,
776,0.896064281463623,3595.9,3599.5,So household theoretically would move out of this case.,,,
777,0.896064281463623,3599.5,3600.4,One of the hotels that are,,,
778,0.8651227355003357,3600.6,3602.5, Listed above into a rental unit.,,,
779,0.8651227355003357,3602.5,3603.9,That's a market-based rental unit.,,,
780,0.8651227355003357,3603.9,3606.4,But the rent would be covered for some period of time.,,,
781,0.8651227355003357,3607.0,3616.5,"And that actually, the 230 that you see listed there was is based off of the formulation approach to make an estimate of how much money to put in there.",,,
782,0.8651227355003357,3616.5,3620.4,"So if you assume 230 households, you a certain, a certain amount of time.",,,
783,0.8651227355003357,3620.4,3625.7,So typically more than 12 months of support was used here and then a certain amount of average rent.,,,
784,0.8651227355003357,3625.7,3627.8,You get the total of almost 9 million dollars.,,,
785,0.8651227355003357,3627.8,3630.5,"That was put into the program, but even if",,,
786,0.8991787433624268,3631.0,3634.8, Every single household that was going to be served have been put in today.,,,
787,0.8991787433624268,3634.9,3640.8,"All of those funds wouldn't obviously be expended because their rental support for some number of months, is that proof answer.",,,
788,0.8991787433624268,3640.8,3644.4,All your questions that doesn't answer my questions just as a quick follow-up.,,,
789,0.8991787433624268,3645.1,3648.4,Those are being counted here as a better unit added.,,,
790,0.8991787433624268,3648.4,3657.3,"In the sense that theoretically, if all 230 rapid rehousing slots were being utilized, that would allow",,,
791,0.7514731287956238,3658.2,3664.7," Giving folks who came from that initial Hotel, those Hotel slot.",,,
792,0.7514731287956238,3664.7,3681.1,"So you could have a scenario for example, where you could have 230 people with the rapid rehousing voucher support, but then, you could also have all 220 hotel rooms full because as people go to Rapid rehousing, new person comes in the hotel.",,,
793,0.7514731287956238,3681.2,3683.0,Is that understanding of how it's working.,,,
794,0.7514731287956238,3683.6,3684.2,That is correct.,,,
795,0.7514731287956238,3684.2,3687.7,"Yes, there they because the the hotel looks",,,
796,0.8077445030212402,3688.2,3690.3, Spell training programs are time limited.,,,
797,0.8077445030212402,3690.3,3691.5,They're all one time funding.,,,
798,0.8077445030212402,3692.3,3695.4,I don't know the degree and the executive could speak to this too.,,,
799,0.8077445030212402,3695.4,3699.6,How much there's there will be backfilling like at what point in time.,,,
800,0.8077445030212402,3699.8,3708.9,"I would assume that if a household was placed in a hotel immediately succeeded in moving with rapid rehousing into longer-term, apartment unit and only a month or two.",,,
801,0.8077445030212402,3708.9,3712.9,"It has elapsed, then obviously backfilling that room and providing the shelter would make sense.",,,
802,0.8077445030212402,3713.2,3717.8,"But if it's month 11 and a half of the that 12 month intervention, I doubt that they are.",,,
803,0.8812611699104309,3717.9,3720.4," ER, would be a backfilling of the shuttles or bed in the hotel.",,,
804,0.8812611699104309,3720.9,3737.3,"Rapid rehousing has is something that the city is supported for quite some time now, and typically it's, you would have people that either unsheltered orange shelter moving out of those places and because in the case of the shelter beds that shelter bed was permanently funded.",,,
805,0.8812611699104309,3737.3,3738.1,So to speak.,,,
806,0.8812611699104309,3738.6,3742.4,"You would obviously backfill for that that household that had been placed, right?",,,
807,0.8812611699104309,3742.4,3742.7,I guess.,,,
808,0.8812611699104309,3742.9,3747.8,I'm just trying to nail down the extent to which we are double counting if we count.,,,
809,0.9039446711540222,3747.9,3752.4, Rapid rehousing and the hotels in our total units.,,,
810,0.9039446711540222,3752.4,3752.9,Added.,,,
811,0.9039446711540222,3753.0,3753.5,Right?,,,
812,0.9039446711540222,3754.5,3769.1,"Because if we, if we were serving a universe of 905 folks be like, I want to know if it might make more sense to like subtract those 230 rapid rehousing spots from the rest.",,,
813,0.9039446711540222,3769.1,3772.5,And that's what I'm just trying to get it just for understanding chart.,,,
814,0.9039446711540222,3773.4,3774.8,I don't have perfect information there.,,,
815,0.9039446711540222,3774.8,3777.8,"What I can say, is that the rapid rehousing",,,
816,0.8312264680862427,3777.9,3783.8, Seeing surge has purposefully been established as an exit strategy from the hotel rooms.,,,
817,0.8312264680862427,3783.8,3790.8,"So looking at the fourth line where 300 people would be placed into some type of a hotel, Sheltering situation.",,,
818,0.8312264680862427,3791.2,3798.4,"Some number of those units will empty out or vacate through the use of a rapper tea, housing subsidy.",,,
819,0.8312264680862427,3798.4,3801.1,So you would have some double counting at that point.,,,
820,0.8312264680862427,3801.3,3807.7,"There's also individuals or households who wouldn't be an appropriate placement for rapid rehousing and so as the city is opening,",,,
821,0.9128387570381165,3807.9,3813.4, Be a permanent permanently affordable housing unit or a permanent Supportive Housing unit.,,,
822,0.9128387570381165,3813.7,3818.1,You might see a situation where they are moved into that rather than going through Rapid rehousing.,,,
823,0.9128387570381165,3818.4,3827.9,"So I can't speak to the places that I don't have data on on where individuals have gone to, and can't say, exactly what the level of overlap is.",,,
824,0.9128387570381165,3827.9,3829.1,It's not zero.,,,
825,0.9128387570381165,3829.2,3829.7,I doubt that.,,,
826,0.9128387570381165,3829.7,3830.6,It's 300.,,,
827,0.9128387570381165,3832.0,3837.7,"All right, and then just one last question to clarify on the TBD and the non.",,,
828,0.8560991883277893,3837.9,3840.1, Congregate shelter category.,,,
829,0.809819221496582,3843.4,3858.3," Based on some of these other categories of its a mix of like hoteling and you know, tiny houses or you know, however that investment decides to get put into practice.",,,
830,0.809819221496582,3859.1,3865.4,"What do you think are like, you know, if I'm pressing you right now in the committee, what do you think are reasonable estimate range?",,,
831,0.809819221496582,3865.4,3870.0,Is in terms of units in that category because you're not in your total.,,,
832,0.809819221496582,3870.0,3871.4,You're not counting anything.,,,
833,0.8784887194633484,3872.1,3883.2," From that line, but I guess my question would be what could we potentially expect when that's implemented just so we can sort of add it to the base line at least for the purposes of this committee today.",,,
834,0.8784887194633484,3884.6,3885.3,That's a good question.,,,
835,0.8784887194633484,3885.3,3886.8,It's difficult to answer.,,,
836,0.8784887194633484,3886.8,3898.0,I understand that part of the presentation that the that HST is going to make in a moment is to share that some of that 9 million dollars is going to be used to as you'll see in them.,,,
837,0.8784887194633484,3898.0,3901.8,"If you look at the fourth line, we assumed 300.",,,
838,0.8729020953178406,3901.9,3905.2, It's only 220 have been stood up for hotel.,,,
839,0.8729020953178406,3905.2,3906.4,Sheltering a third Hotel.,,,
840,0.8729020953178406,3906.4,3907.8,So to speak was going to be acquired.,,,
841,0.8729020953178406,3908.1,3917.9,"And that the non-congregate line that you're looking at the 45, the sixth line, where it's TVD that those funds are being utilized to make that possible.",,,
842,0.8729020953178406,3918.5,3927.0,"If that's the case Hotel Sheltering can can range anywhere from the, I think we can get down to like 60 thousand dollars.",,,
843,0.8729020953178406,3927.2,3931.7,If you kind of both of them told the actual units and from a hotel and the services.,,,
844,0.8335081338882446,3931.8,3941.4," Has and made that an annualized number, all the way to something the range of like 104,000 that all varies based on the model, who's operating at the type of people being served things like that.",,,
845,0.8335081338882446,3941.7,3944.6,So that would be a relatively expensive intervention.,,,
846,0.8335081338882446,3945.8,3950.3,There's also the possibility that it could be used for other kinds of it's not Congress shelters.,,,
847,0.8335081338882446,3950.3,3953.3,So tiny and Villages have a lower Capital cost.,,,
848,0.8335081338882446,3953.3,3959.1,So to speak we assume six hundred thousand dollars to create 40 at 40 unit Village.,,,
849,0.8335081338882446,3959.1,3960.1,So it's much less.,,,
850,0.8335081338882446,3960.1,3961.8,I think that's around.,,,
851,0.7636532187461853,3962.2,3964.6, I don't have not not that good at Mental Math.,,,
852,0.7636532187461853,3964.6,3967.2,"I think that's in 20,000, but maybe somebody has a calculator handy.",,,
853,0.7636532187461853,3968.5,3972.0,And so that would be a lower cost to get it started up.,,,
854,0.7636532187461853,3972.0,3977.2,"And then we do assume between 20 and 20, maybe 23,000 on the high end.",,,
855,0.7636532187461853,3977.2,3981.1,But usually we assume about twenty thousand dollars per units to operate it for a year.,,,
856,0.7636532187461853,3981.1,3984.9,So depending on what the mix would be.,,,
857,0.7636532187461853,3984.9,3990.3,You could have a pretty wide variance in terms of how many units could get supported with that 9 million dollars.,,,
858,0.8911793828010559,3991.0,3991.3, Great.,,,
859,0.8911793828010559,3991.3,3991.9,Thank you.,,,
860,0.8911793828010559,3992.5,4002.0,"Any questions from colleagues on this slide for Jeff, before we look at the next slide of our subsequent investment.",,,
861,0.8911793828010559,4002.0,4004.6,You've made us Council anything from,,,
862,0.8931834697723389,4006.7,4007.8," Okay, great.",,,
863,0.8931834697723389,4007.8,4009.2,Jeff next slide.,,,
864,0.8931834697723389,4009.2,4010.2,Thanks for indulging.,,,
865,0.8931834697723389,4010.2,4011.3,Those initial questions.,,,
866,0.8931834697723389,4012.9,4014.3,So this next slide is delineate.,,,
867,0.8931834697723389,4014.3,4019.4,It primarily because all of these funds are from the American Rescue plan act from the vitamin stration.,,,
868,0.8931834697723389,4019.4,4027.1,"This last late winter spring, the funds were eventually came to and were adopted by the council and append.",,,
869,0.8931834697723389,4027.6,4030.5,An ordinance for accepted on June 21st.,,,
870,0.8931834697723389,4030.5,4035.6,So it would be unrealistic to accept expect pretty much all of these to be in operation at,,,
871,0.7978031635284424,4035.8,4036.3, Point.,,,
872,0.7978031635284424,4036.3,4041.8,I thought that was therefore important to delineate the two lumps of funding that we're talking about all of these funds.,,,
873,0.7978031635284424,4041.8,4046.7,I'll almost 45 million dollars worth our one-time funds as well.,,,
874,0.7978031635284424,4046.9,4052.0,"And because the council's already, because council members just recently, saw this breakdown.",,,
875,0.7978031635284424,4052.0,4054.2,I won't go into detail about each of the unit's here.,,,
876,0.7978031635284424,4054.2,4060.1,"I'm just happy to address any questions, but I but it would be, we'd be remiss not in highlighting that.",,,
877,0.7978031635284424,4060.1,4064.9,These Investments are also forthcoming to serve people experiencing homelessness.,,,
878,0.896842360496521,4066.1,4068.2, Any questions on this chart?,,,

1030,0.8730320334434509,4880.8,4887.9,But I am happy to say that we have received the last set of edits from Sound Transit on the lease.,,,
1031,0.8730320334434509,4888.5,4889.9,And it looks like we're in the home.,,,
1032,0.8730320334434509,4889.9,4892.7,Stretch with that critical piece in place.,,,
1033,0.8730320334434509,4893.3,4897.7,We are expecting a mid to late September opening.,,,
1034,0.8730320334434509,4898.5,4909.7,And that that allows for approximately six weeks of stand-up of the village itself depending upon how that goes.,,,
1035,0.8205295205116272,4909.8,4913.6, It might ich over into early October.,,,
1036,0.8205295205116272,4914.3,4923.6,"One thing to note here and you'll hear me say this again with the inner bay is that because of the site size, which is about 18,000 square feet.",,,

1046,0.9011015892028809,4976.0,4982.1,And then finally with all of this work going forward through 2021.,,,

1056,0.8986004590988159,5028.3,5033.1,So first off the 89 just carry units.,,,
1057,0.8986004590988159,5033.1,5042.1,"Those are units that are unconnected to the Joint procurement with King County that we funded in the Seattle recovery plan, correct?",,,

1061,0.8986004590988159,5048.8,5052.3,So that's like 89 more city-funded units.,,,

1063,0.8986004590988159,5053.7,5054.9,And then there's also,,,
1064,0.9007506966590881,5055.0,5058.3, going to be units that are related to whatever we can do.,,,
1065,0.9007506966590881,5058.3,5064.8,"Jointly with King County, that will be additive to that, which is, that's great, going back to to the tiny house.",,,

1170,0.9000447392463684,5732.6,5736.3,"I miss councilmember Strauss earlier, very sorry about that.",,,

1174,0.9000447392463684,5749.6,5756.1,I know how hard you are personally looking to see these projects stood up and I know I'm working with you.,,,
1175,0.9000447392463684,5756.4,5758.7,Your work is what led to see.,,,
1176,0.8930338621139526,5758.9,5762.5, He owed owns and the regional Authority on homelessness being stood up.,,,
1177,0.8930338621139526,5762.5,5763.7,So I appreciate that.,,,
1178,0.8930338621139526,5763.7,5770.6,I do have questions that are similar to what council member Peterson who was asking.,,,
1179,0.8930338621139526,5770.6,5775.3,And I'd like to provide an opportunity for you to share with the viewing public.,,,
1180,0.8930338621139526,5775.3,5782.4,"Some of what goes into getting these programs funded because it's from, and correct me if I'm wrong here.",,,
1181,0.8930338621139526,5782.4,5788.7,It's my understanding that the funds for all of these shelter units were passed in.,,,
1182,0.9036087393760681,5788.9,5791.5, West Falls 2021 budget.,,,
1183,0.9036087393760681,5791.5,5792.7,Is that I'm seeing you nodding.,,,
1184,0.9036087393760681,5792.7,5792.8,Yes.,,,
1185,0.9036087393760681,5793.2,5795.8,And so what I am?,,,
1186,0.9036087393760681,5795.8,5798.8,What I'm having frustration with not at you personally.,,,
1187,0.9036087393760681,5798.8,5803.4,Frustration with our process here is that we are nearly a year later.,,,
1188,0.9036087393760681,5803.4,5807.2,And these units are not stood up.,,,
1189,0.9036087393760681,5807.2,5810.7,We knew that we would be funding these units in the budget process.,,,
1190,0.9036087393760681,5810.7,5811.5,Last year.,,,
1191,0.9036087393760681,5811.5,5814.1,We have found the sites.,,,
1192,0.9036087393760681,5814.1,5818.4,"We need the we need more than 400 units, you need 4.",,,
1193,0.7899028658866882,5818.9,5831.5," And units and granted you've got 350 units setup to to up into today, for 2021, an additional 400 rings to about 750 Polly year.",,,
1194,0.7899028658866882,5832.4,5839.4,"This is important work in the right direction, especially when we compare it with the house health, for housing and work of CEO, dones.",,,
1195,0.7899028658866882,5839.7,5841.0,"I get, can you share?",,,
1196,0.7899028658866882,5841.0,5845.7,Because I needed these 400 units set up in January.,,,
1197,0.8798412680625916,5846.5,5848.4, Can you help me in the general public?,,,
1198,0.8798412680625916,5848.4,5849.2,Understand?,,,
1199,0.8798412680625916,5849.8,5851.0,What is taking?,,,
1200,0.8798412680625916,5852.0,5854.0,Why the why the long timeline?,,,
1201,0.9128382205963135,5855.4,5857.6," Yeah, it's a really great question.",,,
1202,0.9128382205963135,5858.3,5865.0,So it is quite complicated to estimate the time that it's going to take to stand up any shelter.,,,
1203,0.9128382205963135,5865.2,5879.2,"It can be affected by any number of issues, any number of steps from identifying, the the appropriate site to figuring out.",,,
1204,0.9128382205963135,5879.2,5885.0,Whether or not there is the need for cepa going through that process there.,,,
1205,0.8699223399162292,5885.2,5890.7, Sometimes demolitions on the property that need to take to occur.,,,
1206,0.8699223399162292,5891.8,5896.6,There's obviously we're seeing from our experience with Rosie's Place.,,,
1207,0.8699223399162292,5897.1,5901.8,Sometimes lease negotiations can take time.,,,
1208,0.8699223399162292,5902.1,5907.7,"So it is, it isn't a, how do I want to say that?",,,
1209,0.8699223399162292,5907.7,5914.8,There's no one way that these projects get stood up either whether it's a village or whether it's an enhanced shelter.,,,
1210,0.9128382205963135,5915.7,5922.2, There's just there's no reliable single blueprint that makes everything exactly the same.,,,
1211,0.9128382205963135,5923.1,5936.6,I end I completely understand the frustration and I hope that you can appreciate as well that we are 100% focused on getting all of these units.,,,
1212,0.9128382205963135,5936.9,5937.7,Stood up.,,,
1213,0.9128382205963135,5938.5,5944.2,"There's it's not an excuse, but you all have heard me say before that.",,,
1214,0.9128382205963135,5944.4,5945.0,We are working.,,,
1215,0.9128383994102478,5945.2,5950.0, With a skeleton crew and our providers are also very stretched.,,,
1216,0.9128383994102478,5950.0,5963.2,"And so, again, the timing on this is something that we are also concerned about and are 100% committed to getting these stood up as quickly as possible.",,,
1217,0.8234259486198425,5968.1,5969.1, It comes from a mosquito.,,,
1218,0.8234259486198425,5969.1,5971.5,Do you have a question at this time as well?,,,
1219,0.7625117301940918,5972.6,5973.1," Thank you, mr.",,,
1220,0.7625117301940918,5973.1,5976.9,"Chair, and just an overall comment last time we had the chance to meet as well.",,,
1221,0.7625117301940918,5976.9,5979.2,The comments were made about providers being stretched.,,,
1222,0.7625117301940918,5979.2,5981.3,Then subsequent to that meeting.,,,
1223,0.7625117301940918,5981.3,5983.8,I had a conversation with a handful of providers.,,,
1224,0.7625117301940918,5984.1,5990.9,"And again, it was reiterated that the capacity issue can be addressed.",,,
1225,0.7625117301940918,5990.9,5994.4,If we can deploy these dollars that Council has already authorized.,,,
1226,0.7625117301940918,5994.6,5999.6,It is a matter of getting these dollars into the Community Partners hands so that they can scale up their team.,,,
1227,0.7748556733131409,6000.3,6008.3," So again, I don't think that it's justifiable reason to have a delay in the timeline as customer.",,,
1228,0.7748556733131409,6008.3,6016.3,Strauss has been asking about to point at or refer back to capacity issues of our providers.,,,
1229,0.7748556733131409,6016.3,6018.8,When they are quite literally begging for these dollars.,,,
1230,0.7748556733131409,6018.8,6020.4,That we already authorized.,,,
1231,0.7748556733131409,6020.9,6025.1,"So again, I think it's a matter of getting these dollars out the door so that they can scale up.",,,
1232,0.8363805413246155,6031.1,6040.8, I completely understand and I'm going to lean a little bit into Mark who I know is going to address those concerns as well.,,,
1233,0.8363805413246155,6041.8,6043.6,"Yeah mark, thank you for your patience.",,,
1234,0.8363805413246155,6043.6,6047.4,Will turn it over to you now and then I'm sure there will be more questions.,,,
1235,0.8363805413246155,6047.8,6051.7,I definitely have a line of questioning along what councilmember Mesquita just said.,,,
1236,0.8363805413246155,6051.7,6058.8,"So I think that was good for shadowing and councilmember mosquitoes part, but we will turn it over to you first.",,,
1237,0.8363805413246155,6058.8,6059.9,I just want to say,,,
1238,0.9048648476600647,6060.6,6064.5," Before your presentation have really, really enjoyed working with you.",,,
1239,0.9048648476600647,6065.0,6068.4,I'm really glad to see you in this position.,,,
1240,0.9048648476600647,6068.4,6070.6,"And, you know, that's why in the introduction today.",,,
1241,0.9048648476600647,6070.6,6075.6,"I didn't want to say, our new Regional homelessness Authority, CEO.",,,
1242,0.9048648476600647,6075.6,6084.9,"I think you're now the homelessness Authority CEO and it's well, established and being well received, and it's been good to work with you on this.",,,
1243,0.9048648476600647,6084.9,6087.4,And I'm glad to have you here for your first time.,,,
1244,0.9048648476600647,6087.4,6090.2,I think in this committee and will hand it over to you.,,,

1248,0.8888084292411804,6093.3,6093.6,I will.,,,
1249,0.8888084292411804,6093.6,6102.1,"Unfortunately, cling to new as long as I can have been role for a three months and a couple weeks.",,,
1250,0.8888084292411804,6102.1,6111.1,"And I think it's just important for everyone to really keep that front and center when asking me about timelines, but I will thank you too.",,,
1251,0.8888084292411804,6111.1,6112.8,As for the record.,,,
1252,0.8888084292411804,6112.9,6116.4,"Mark, Jones CEO of the King County Regional homelessness Authority.",,,
1253,0.8888084292411804,6116.4,6117.6,They them theirs pronouns.,,,

1255,0.8888084292411804,6120.4,6121.2,I will touch briefly.,,,
1256,0.679731547832489,6121.4,6141.1," The on some of the workforce issues that you asked interim director called me about, I have a slightly different vantage point in terms of we're beginning to look at it regionally and there are some things that I think we are conflating in our conversation right now that the providers have keyed me in on pulling apart and having more nuanced discussion about it.",,,
1257,0.679731547832489,6141.1,6143.7,I will bring those forward in a moment.,,,
1258,0.679731547832489,6145.2,6150.4,So I want to give you a snapshot of where we are.,,,
1259,0.7846834659576416,6151.3,6153.2, And make sure that the public and the providers.,,,
1260,0.7846834659576416,6153.2,6158.6,All have a clear sense of sort of what the authorities up to where we are in ramp up.,,,
1261,0.7846834659576416,6158.6,6164.9,And what the expectations that I have in that our team has about where we're going to head in the near-term.,,,
1262,0.7846834659576416,6165.9,6181.2,I think the most important thing and the thing that everyone needs to hear very clearly that I said in every meeting that I will reiterate here is that we will assume control of the contracts in the entire system that includes,,,
1263,0.8022361397743225,6181.5,6198.2," Current city contracts and current County contracts beginning in January of twenty two because of the delays, in my, my starting a CEO process selection process, even really beginning, which is because there was a pandemic.",,,
1264,0.8022361397743225,6198.2,6201.6,"I just think it's really important to say that over and over for a kid, right?",,,
1265,0.8022361397743225,6201.6,6205.2,"That, that was not, that was not people not doing their jobs.",,,

1267,0.8312703371047974,6211.3,6213.7, The city and county teams for the work that they had did.,,,
1268,0.8312703371047974,6213.7,6214.9,In that time.,,,
1269,0.8312703371047974,6216.1,6223.5,We will not have the time or capacity to issue an RFP for those 22 contracts.,,,
1270,0.8312703371047974,6223.8,6240.7,"And so our internal assumption and what we've communicated is that we will level fund and make very few changes to contract terms other than who reports go to, who provides technical assistance, who does the the",,,
1271,0.9128382205963135,6241.4,6248.4, Troubleshooting those are really the only changes we anticipate in 22 in 22.,,,
1272,0.9128382205963135,6248.4,6253.3,Once we are are staffed which I suspect we'll hit the capacity to do this.,,,
1273,0.9128382205963135,6253.5,6254.0,Probably.,,,
1274,0.9128382205963135,6254.0,6256.8,I hope mid-January with the appropriate pipelines.,,,
1275,0.9128382205963135,6257.5,6266.1,"We will begin a collaborative RFP development process with the whole community and that is is regionally, right?",,,
1276,0.9128382205963135,6266.1,6270.6,So that'll be in all of our sub-regions of which Seattle Metro is one.,,,

1279,0.7878553867340088,6296.5,6303.0, I believe that the 23 system will be very different from the 22 system and from the current system.,,,
1280,0.7878553867340088,6304.5,6315.6,"However, by the time that we get to that RFP, I also expect there will not be surprises because will have gone through a really robust process to arrive at what we're building and why we're building it.",,,

1284,0.9128382205963135,6340.0,6344.1,I suspect that inside that conversation.,,,
1285,0.9128382205963135,6344.5,6347.5,We will have an opportunity to really work closely.,,,
1286,0.9128382205963135,6347.5,6350.5,"And this is in our legislation, which is great.",,,

1291,0.823371946811676,6361.3,6362.1,That isn't working.,,,

1295,0.823371946811676,6377.4,6384.4,"I think our team agrees with that certainly for folks who are having more complex needs, but it's things like that, right?",,,
1296,0.823371946811676,6384.4,6386.1,That we expect to Bubble Up.,,,
1297,0.8278537392616272,6386.3,6392.3, And and seek Pathways implementation around during that RFP development process in early 22.,,,
1298,0.8139402270317078,6393.5,6400.2," Simultaneously, we are working on what we are referring to as our catalytic portfolio.",,,
1299,0.8139402270317078,6400.2,6412.5,And these are three things that we have identified as being important enough to pursue separate and apart from our budget cycle and separate and apart from a 22 RFP.,,,
1300,0.8139402270317078,6413.6,6423.0,"And in this space, we're really pursuing public-private partnership and looking to be able to move these buckets of work forward, as quickly as possible.",,,
1301,0.8139402270317078,6423.0,6423.2,And,,,
1302,0.9077476859092712,6424.2,6431.5, I will speak briefly to them and then speak briefly to councilmember mosquitoes point and then I am done.,,,
1303,0.9077476859092712,6431.8,6437.1,But the three things that we're focused on are pure navigation.,,,
1304,0.9077476859092712,6437.1,6440.0,I believe you heard again the lived experience Coalition speak to that.,,,
1305,0.9077476859092712,6440.0,6444.1,We've heard over and over again from people experiencing homelessness.,,,
1306,0.9077476859092712,6444.1,6446.1,And the data is clear.,,,
1307,0.9077476859092712,6446.1,6451.9,"I want to be really clear that this is, this is also about 30 plus years of data across multiple systems.",,,
1308,0.8713664412498474,6453.3,6471.1," That peer support makes a significant difference in the course and outcome of complex system, navigation, particularly win that that involves any kind of substance or Behavioral Health difficulty, right?",,,
1309,0.8713664412498474,6471.9,6473.9,And so we really want to lean into that.,,,
1310,0.8713664412498474,6473.9,6475.6,"I mean, want to lean into it quickly.",,,
1311,0.8713664412498474,6476.7,6483.2,"We believe that there is also a Workforce to do that both with the LEC and other folks right frankly, who are",,,
1312,0.8501333594322205,6484.0,6490.7," Probably Outreach jobs right now, but are not being asked to use that lived experience as part of their work.",,,
1313,0.8501333594322205,6490.7,6491.3,Right?,,,
1314,0.8501333594322205,6491.7,6506.0,"And we really think that there's a real opportunity here to enhance the experience and outcomes of the system, frankly, even before we managed to do the, the assistant integration work that is ultimately necessary.",,,
1315,0.8501333594322205,6506.0,6506.5,Right?,,,
1316,0.8501333594322205,6507.2,6513.1,But that systems integration work is four to five years out from from completion and people.,,,
1317,0.8929139971733093,6513.3,6517.8, Need to feel the difference in our system and to experience better outcomes right now.,,,
1318,0.8929139971733093,6517.8,6522.4,"And so we really think that pure navigation, is a pathway to doing that.",,,
1319,0.8929139971733093,6522.4,6529.1,And we also feel like it's a way to engage members of the community.,,,
1320,0.8929139971733093,6529.1,6535.3,"And I think, again, you heard this from lived experience members, who may be looking for an opportunity, right?",,,
1321,0.8929139971733093,6535.3,6539.2,"May have stabilized inside a Housing Opportunity, right?",,,
1322,0.8929139971733093,6539.2,6541.6,And are looking for an opportunity to re-engage.,,,
1323,0.8929139971733093,6541.6,6543.3,And to be part of,,,
1324,0.8124135136604309,6543.4,6548.8, Sort of Social Services or Human Services response system because of their experience with it.,,,
1325,0.7278079390525818,6550.1,6554.8, The next thing that we're really focused on is data quality and a by name list.,,,
1326,0.7278079390525818,6555.4,6558.7,So I Believe by hearken back to my time.,,,
1327,0.7278079390525818,6558.7,6579.5,With some of your 2018 data is a thing that we talked about a lot and the ability to get answers the ability to believe those answers and be really able to hang a hat on saying that a thing is happening or not and part of the difficulty in getting some of that information has always been fragmentation.,,,
1328,0.8329465985298157,6580.2,6587.1, And part of it has also been the ability of the system to frankly collect granular high quality data.,,,
1329,0.8329465985298157,6588.1,6595.0,And so we're really focused on bringing that capacity up and scaling it across the region.,,,
1330,0.8329465985298157,6595.8,6598.8,I also want to be really clear that when I say by name list.,,,
1331,0.8329465985298157,6598.8,6601.7,I don't just mean a list of names.,,,
1332,0.8329465985298157,6601.7,6603.5,That's that that is not the information.,,,
1333,0.8329465985298157,6603.5,6604.2,We need.,,,
1334,0.8329465985298157,6604.8,6606.9,We need to know who you are.,,,
1335,0.8329465985298157,6607.2,6608.4,Where you are.,,,
1336,0.8329465985298157,6608.4,6609.5,What your needs are.,,,
1337,0.9056456089019775,6609.6,6609.9, Our.,,,
1338,0.9056456089019775,6609.9,6616.3,"And if we're doing anything about and if we're not right, we need to begin to identify the gaps.",,,
1339,0.9056456089019775,6617.3,6620.5,I fundamentally believe that it is the data quality.,,,
1340,0.9056456089019775,6620.5,6625.3,"And this sort of by name list, bucket that is going to help us really wrap our arms around.",,,
1341,0.9056456089019775,6625.4,6632.5,What is the delta in resourcing in the system versus what we would need in order to truly end homelessness in the region?,,,
1342,0.9056456089019775,6633.3,6638.3,"And I think that we all want to know that and understand that and be able to again, really hang a hat on.",,,
1343,0.9056456089019775,6638.6,6639.5,Why it is the right.,,,
1344,0.8975898027420044,6639.6,6643.9," Member and I think that, you know, the the listing again to public comment.",,,
1345,0.8975898027420044,6643.9,6649.8,I think that the folks folks want us to have that accountability and I think data can get us there.,,,
1346,0.8975898027420044,6650.1,6669.5,"I also want to be clear that there's a relationship between pure navigation, and data quality in terms of our thinking, which is to say that one of the difficulties that we have heard from folks, experiencing homelessness over and over and over again with regard to how we do our data collection is that it's largely situated.",,,
1347,0.9089516401290894,6669.6,6679.2," Inside intake, protocols and that it is often very invasive, very repetitive and that it happens when you don't have a relationship with someone, right?",,,
1348,0.9089516401290894,6679.2,6688.5,"So you walk in a door and someone immediately starts asking you a whole host of really, really intense and invasive questions and you don't know them, right.",,,
1349,0.9089516401290894,6689.3,6699.5,"One of the things that we heard over the course of the system audit in 2018 and throughout all the 2019 and are now hearing again, is that there's a need",,,
1350,0.797508716583252,6699.7,6703.2," For us to think about phased in take meaning, right?",,,
1351,0.797508716583252,6703.2,6706.5,That you ask a question in direct relationship to win.,,,
1352,0.797508716583252,6706.5,6714.5,"You need that information in order to activate a specific support and that that information gathering be situated inside a relationship, right?",,,
1353,0.797508716583252,6714.5,6721.3,"So that rather than going from Outreach worker, to outreach, worker, to case manager, to case, manager and housing stabilization coordinator Etc.",,,
1354,0.797508716583252,6721.8,6729.5,That you have a single person who you work with for the course of your engagement with our system who,,,
1355,0.8673986792564392,6729.6,6732.9, Who is really helping you to understand?,,,
1356,0.8673986792564392,6732.9,6735.4,"Okay, well, now is the time for this information, right?",,,
1357,0.8673986792564392,6735.5,6737.6,And can and can help be a hub for it.,,,
1358,0.8673986792564392,6739.1,6746.0,"I also think and I neglected to mention, as well as talking about pure navigation and I want to be clear that in that model.",,,
1359,0.8673986792564392,6746.0,6749.6,"What we are imagining is really that you would have a person, right?",,,
1360,0.8673986792564392,6749.6,6755.7,"Who is your person from wherever you enter the system to permanency, right?",,,
1361,0.8673986792564392,6756.0,6759.5,"That, it really is about that relationship and really is about providing.",,,

1363,0.8476120829582214,6763.3,6771.3," And the last thing that we're really focused on is something that we're calling Bridge housing, which is we've identified that in the system, I think.",,,
1364,0.8476120829582214,6771.3,6786.1,And we experience this daily in our conversations and how we can't get the system to perform the way that we would like is that there's a significant gap between our literal gap between our shelter resources and our permanency resources.,,,
1365,0.8476120829582214,6786.3,6788.4,So the permanency resources right?,,,
1366,0.8476120829582214,6788.7,6792.9,"Maybe that would chores, maybe rapid, maybe just general 0, to 30 percent, Amaya.",,,

1368,0.7035013437271118,6796.6,6798.2,And then we have shelter.,,,
1369,0.7035013437271118,6799.1,6806.4,We don't really have a whole lot of stuff in between other than for a couple of really essentially special subpopulations.,,,
1370,0.7035013437271118,6807.5,6822.7,"What we've identified is that at what that means is that edit administrative level, even if we did not intend, even if we never said it aloud, where we're essentially saying to people is while you're on the waiting list for this thing, your options of where you can wait our shelter or outside.",,,
1371,0.8720269203186035,6823.3,6824.5, And that can't work.,,,
1372,0.8720269203186035,6825.1,6831.3,And so what we need to do is expand our capacity in that in the middle in the bridge.,,,
1373,0.8720269203186035,6831.9,6844.6,"And so what we're really looking at is, what is that look like we're working with again, people with lived experience, and with providers to articulate a program model there to understand how much it might cost.",,,
1374,0.8720269203186035,6845.0,6852.9,"But again, I think this is an opportunity for us to pull from other systems that have actually already begun to",,,
1375,0.7251943349838257,6853.1,6856.8, There's and in some cases of operated these kinds of models for 30 or 40 years.,,,
1376,0.7251943349838257,6856.8,6864.3,"So we've been looking a lot of disability housing at recovery housing, medical respite Adult Family Home models, right?",,,

1382,0.9114408493041992,6890.7,6898.4,We also know that these programs can be titrated with regard to their service connection around the Acuity of who lives there.,,,
1383,0.9114408493041992,6898.7,6912.6,"And that there's a lot of flexibility with regard to having models with folks who don't need a lot of support to models with folks who need a lot quite a bit, but that this success right is possible leveraging.",,,

1398,0.804767370223999,7003.0,7004.6, pipeline is gone.,,,
1399,0.804767370223999,7005.3,7013.1,"And so we're hearing from providers again around the region that even where they have budget to hire folks, right?",,,

1401,0.804767370223999,7015.5,7019.1,"And so we need to figure out again, working with folks.",,,

1404,0.7730873823165894,7033.1,7033.5, Right.,,,
1405,0.7730873823165894,7033.5,7047.7,"And so folks if identified that they are in need of you know additional training and support around trauma-informed, care around how to create supportive environment Etc that for them again in our conversations.",,,

1410,0.912838876247406,7067.3,7071.1,I think that it's and I will just say by way of closing for me.,,,
1411,0.912838876247406,7071.1,7084.7,"This is really critical because as I think, you know, we know from the statistics a lot of the sort of Front Line staff and and after that support the system are people of color and also majority women.",,,

1570,0.9019180536270142,7878.6,7887.2,"I will say that all of our staff, all of the HSI staff were assisted by human resources.",,,
1571,0.9019180536270142,7887.4,7903.7,"There is a program within the city called project hire that helps employees to do resume work around, interviewing skills, all of those riffs off.",,,
1572,0.8641358017921448,7903.8,7911.1, Skills that are needed to be competitive and successful in future employment opportunities.,,,
1573,0.8641358017921448,7912.1,7923.3,We 100% agree that there is an opportunity for our staff to apply for positions with the authority.,,,
1574,0.8641358017921448,7923.3,7926.7,We have great talent and commitment.,,,
1575,0.8641358017921448,7927.1,7933.7,"And I personally think the authority would be lucky to, to be able to employ some of the, a",,,
1576,0.8219324946403503,7933.9,7934.6, Sigh staff.,,,
1577,0.8219324946403503,7934.9,7939.4,Although I am shooting myself in the foot because I would love for folks to stay on as well.,,,
1578,0.8219324946403503,7940.0,7947.3,"But as I noted there, majority of the HSI staff do have other employment opportunities within the city.",,,
1579,0.8219324946403503,7948.6,7963.7,"And so we feel as though there's a lot of ample opportunity for folks to consider the authority, one Nuance or technical, correction that I might make if you'll indulge",,,
1580,0.7508699297904968,7963.8,7964.2, Shmi.,,,
1581,0.7508699297904968,7964.6,7967.4,There is no transition of Staff or staff positions.,,,
1582,0.7508699297904968,7967.4,7972.7,The only thing that the city is providing the authority is budget Authority.,,,
1583,0.7508699297904968,7973.2,7976.2,And in that budget Authority that the full budget Authority.,,,
1584,0.7508699297904968,7976.2,7992.9,"The vast majority of it is, of course, the budget associated with contracts, but then of course, there's admin budget that is the funding that the authority will be using to develop its Staffing model and and to staff the authority.",,,
1585,0.912838339805603,7993.9,8005.8, Also notice and we will re include this in the report that despite my shortfall Mark was proactive in making sure that the governing committee had their Staffing plan.,,,
1586,0.912838339805603,8006.6,8010.9,"So again, I sincerely apologize for the delay.",,,
1587,0.912838339805603,8011.3,8014.6,Completely on me and you will get that report.,,,
1588,0.7056004405021667,8018.9,8021.1, Thank you test for this clarifications.,,,
1589,0.7056004405021667,8021.7,8022.5,Okay colleagues.,,,
1590,0.7056004405021667,8022.5,8024.5,I am going to go through a few of my questions.,,,
1591,0.7056004405021667,8024.5,8033.7,"I think some of them are fairly brief, just to get some clarification on a few things from public comment, and then a few other pending Investments.",,,
1592,0.7056004405021667,8033.7,8045.7,"We didn't cover here, but that are under the American Recovery plan, that, that, I think it would be good to, to address before the committee ends.",,,
1593,0.7056004405021667,8046.5,8048.4,So first just to dive down a,,,
1594,0.8493978977203369,8048.6,8054.0, Into the rapid rehousing component of the current hoteling surge program.,,,
1595,0.8493978977203369,8054.7,8060.1,"I think, first off, and I think this was covered test in your presentation but to cover.",,,
1596,0.8493978977203369,8060.7,8068.1,How many total folks are currently enrolled in those rapid rehousing slots and does the department?,,,
1597,0.8493978977203369,8068.1,8075.9,Anticipate maximizing that rapid rehousing resource between now and the end of the year.,,,
1598,0.8493978977203369,8076.1,8077.4,It just as the first question.,,,
1599,0.8493978977203369,8077.4,8078.3,I'd rather be house.,,,
1600,0.5337398648262024,8078.5,8078.7, Nothing.,,,
1601,0.7728995680809021,8080.1,8081.4," Um, sure.",,,
1602,0.7728995680809021,8081.9,8090.6,"So the total number of folks that are currently enrolled is 82, through the Executive Hotel Pacific.",,,
1603,0.7728995680809021,8091.0,8108.4,"As I noticed that are, as I mentioned cheap, cl2 Club is the rapid rehousing provider for the Kings in, and we are working closely with them around the program and I helping them work with clients to identify opportunities.",,,
1604,0.8929346203804016,8111.6,8117.8," Councilmember Lewis, I have completely blanked on the second half of your question.",,,
1605,0.8929346203804016,8117.8,8119.5,I'm embarrassed and I'm so sorry.,,,
1606,0.8929346203804016,8119.8,8121.8,"No, what do you anticipate?",,,
1607,0.8929346203804016,8121.8,8125.9,The Demand Being for the rest of the year?,,,
1608,0.8929346203804016,8125.9,8131.8,"So if there's 82, currently my understanding from Jeff's presentation earlier, so there's 230 spots.",,,
1609,0.8929346203804016,8131.8,8138.9,So do you does the department anticipate being able to max out those rapid rehousing spots?,,,
1610,0.8352330923080444,8140.1,8141.9, Here at the halfway mark of the year.,,,
1611,0.8352330923080444,8142.1,8144.4,"Yeah, again, apologies for that.",,,
1612,0.8352330923080444,8144.4,8145.1,Yeah.,,,
1613,0.8352330923080444,8145.1,8145.6,Yes.,,,
1614,0.8352330923080444,8145.7,8147.5,"Yes, we do not.",,,
1615,0.8352330923080444,8147.5,8155.6,"So you may know that the funding for Rapid rehousing ESG, actually, goes into 20 22.",,,
1616,0.8352330923080444,8155.6,8166.1,We have every intention of making sure that all of those spots are utilized with the hotels.,,,
1617,0.8352330923080444,8166.6,8169.5,"In particular, we, as I said,",,,
1618,0.8734330534934998,8169.9,8180.2," Working, not just with the Chief Seattle Club on rapid rehousing, but we know that CSC has a new affordable housing project coming online.",,,
1619,0.8734330534934998,8180.2,8187.2,I'll all and that that will serve as a resource as well for clients that are currently in Kings in.,,,
1620,0.8734330534934998,8188.3,8197.9,"And with 82 already enrolled in Rapid rehousing, that's about half of the clients that we currently have with the Executive Hotel Pacific.",,,
1621,0.8734330534934998,8198.4,8199.3,So that's,,,
1622,0.8248999118804932,8199.8,8212.7, That bodes well for the progress that they're making as we get a better feel for how the rapid rehousing slots are going to be utilized through the hotel.,,,
1623,0.8248999118804932,8212.7,8213.9,The hotel based shelters.,,,
1624,0.8248999118804932,8214.1,8229.7,"We are also looking at opportunities to make sure that those resources are available to shelters and two Villages again, to try to increase that concept of throughput.",,,
1625,0.9128385186195374,8230.2,8239.6, So that we are creating spaces in highly desirable shelters by using rapid rehousing to help folks that are long stairs.,,,
1626,0.9128385186195374,8239.7,8241.0,Get into housing.,,,
1627,0.8529999852180481,8243.6,8260.5," And this might be more of a question for Mark given, you know, when we would be considering an investment like this, but in terms of the feedback from our friends over at the lived experience Coalition, who have been doing a lot of Engagement with the rocker.",,,
1628,0.8529999852180481,8260.5,8272.1,"Housing program, gave a lot of feedback around the length and the amount of time of the subsidy and wanting to explore expanding that to to a two-year subsidy.",,,
1629,0.8332740664482117,8273.7,8280.6, I guess I just wanted to ask whether in the wrap-up of the hsd program.,,,
1630,0.8332740664482117,8280.6,8284.6,"We're doing this year, if there might be some assessment looking at.",,,
1631,0.8492271304130554,8285.8,8289.2, Whether that extended amount of coverage.,,,
1632,0.7544678449630737,8290.5,8297.3, Would have been beneficial fully acknowledging that that's going to be an expensive ad.,,,
1633,0.7544678449630737,8298.2,8301.0,"If we determine that, we want to go that way.",,,
1634,0.7544678449630737,8302.2,8319.6,But I would sort of like to see maybe an assessment as to what the impact of our the effectiveness of our rapid rehousing program would be if we extended that coverage period just to throw into this question to potentially.,,,
1635,0.8948307633399963,8320.3,8324.5, Extending the rapid rehousing enrollment.,,,
1636,0.8948307633399963,8324.5,8331.0,Now that just care is going to be one of our hotel and partners to the just care pool of folks as well.,,,
1637,0.8948307633399963,8331.0,8334.8,If that's something that's operationally being planned by hsd.,,,
1638,0.8948307633399963,8334.8,8337.0,So there's a lot there in that question.,,,
1639,0.8948307633399963,8337.0,8350.1,"Probably for both Mark and test but I'll let Mark go first since it's been a while since we talked to Mark and then and then give it back, you council member, I can say without an assessment that it would.",,,
1640,0.759998083114624,8350.3,8360.5, Be nice to House people for longer that data is and I think that we are we concur with our lived experience colleagues.,,,
1641,0.759998083114624,8361.1,8376.3,"I will say that there is work already underway to extend the rapid rehousing, subsidy that we are in partnership with HSI around using arpa dollars to extend that to be a year.",,,
1642,0.759998083114624,8376.3,8379.5,"And instead of the, the traditional rapid time frame.",,,
1643,0.759998083114624,8379.8,8380.2,I'll also,,,
1644,0.7931634187698364,8380.3,8391.7," They just for the good of the order that the city has long, had a different rapid protocol than the nation and has always tried to extend that Cliff.",,,
1645,0.7931634187698364,8391.7,8395.7,But this this latest work to pull it out all the way to a year.,,,
1646,0.7931634187698364,8395.7,8401.5,"I think, is quite substantive what we are hearing from our live experienced colleagues.",,,
1647,0.7931634187698364,8401.5,8405.1,"Right is like 18 to 24 months would be ideal, right?",,,
1648,0.7931634187698364,8405.7,8410.1,"And so in subsequent, budget conversations, if if we can aim for that now,",,,
1649,0.8851343393325806,8410.2,8414.4," Member, I think that that would be great again.",,,
1650,0.8851343393325806,8414.4,8435.6,"I think that like, what we're looking always at is, what is the the optimal support package that's going to allow people time to stabilize and then reattach to community natural supports and the the other things that they need, you know, potentially including Workforce.",,,
1651,0.8851343393325806,8435.6,8437.1,Although I think I always am a feel.,,,
1652,0.8851343393325806,8437.1,8440.2,Obligated to say the majority people experiencing homelessness are already working that.,,,
1653,0.8387822508811951,8440.3,8441.5," Like that, we should say that.",,,
1654,0.8387822508811951,8441.5,8459.4,"Every time we talk I will also say that there is the opportunity right now to because of the emergency housing, vouchers to be thoughtful about which resource which folks get attached to, right.",,,
1655,0.8387822508811951,8460.0,8465.6,So the ehv timeline is 10 years of support.,,,
1656,0.8387822508811951,8466.3,8470.1,And so I think it's really important just to have,,,
1657,0.9069132804870605,8470.2,8472.1, Have that as part of the conversation.,,,
1658,0.9069132804870605,8472.6,8478.9,We received a lot of each V vectors and because of the the way that calculation for disbursement operates at the federal level.,,,
1659,0.9069132804870605,8479.7,8488.6,"And so as we look to deploy that resource, we will be trying to match people to the right thing, always, right?",,,
1660,0.9069132804870605,8488.9,8497.2,So that if there's any concern that the year of subsidy is not enough that we would then look to route that person towards Annie.,,,
1661,0.9069132804870605,8497.3,8499.3,Sorry an emergency housing voucher instead.,,,
1662,0.9127905964851379,8501.6,8513.5," Thank you for that clarification and and test for sort of the hsd side of clarifying, you know, get well, I guess to actually to hsd clarifications.",,,
1663,0.9127905964851379,8513.8,8521.2,"So the first is, since just care, will essentially be the third hotel for lack of a better term.",,,
1664,0.9127905964851379,8521.4,8523.8,"And that being announced today, which is great.",,,
1665,0.9127905964851379,8524.9,8530.6,"Well, that mean, that just care will have access to the rapid rehousing program, like the executive cific.",,,
1666,0.8131906986236572,8531.4,8550.2," The next question would be is hsd going to then be extending new shelter offers as people move out of the executive Pacific and the just care hotels to allow new people to come in to the shelters to, to make sure that we're continuing to offer folks on the street a place to go.",,,
1667,0.8131906986236572,8550.7,8552.2,"Yeah, two good questions.",,,
1668,0.8131906986236572,8552.2,8555.1,"So, to the just care, question.",,,
1669,0.8131906986236572,8555.6,8561.2,"Yes, we had talked to when the PDA and HSI were originally talking.",,,
1670,0.9128382802009583,8561.3,8567.3," Talking about the traditional third hotel, where the city would have least the property.",,,
1671,0.9128382802009583,8567.6,8572.7,We just weren't able to come to an agreement that actually worked for the just CARE program.,,,
1672,0.9128382802009583,8573.3,8589.5,"And so we're happy that we're being able to invest in that model in a, in a slightly different way, but during that initial conversation, they folks, it's just care of the folks at the PDA indicated.",,,
1673,0.9128382802009583,8589.5,8591.2,Definitely an interest.,,,
1674,0.8933653235435486,8591.8,8592.9, In Rapid rehousing.,,,
1675,0.8933653235435486,8592.9,8608.4,"And so yes, we will work with them because we know that that is a time-limited program as well as the funding will go through June of 2022 and we want to help them avoid a cliff at the end of that.",,,
1676,0.8933653235435486,8609.3,8616.8,"And then, in terms of the turnover in the hotel's, creating opportunities for folks to move into the hotel's.",,,
1677,0.8933653235435486,8617.7,8621.2,"Yes, and we need to be mindful of the",,,
1678,0.8986652493476868,8621.3,8641.1," ability that the providers Lehigh and Chief Seattle Club will have to make sure that folks do have a successful exit to permanent housing, the the challenge with one-time funding and the challenge was standing up new programs with just one time, funding is",,,
1679,0.9101080894470215,8642.9,8653.8, Is that we recognize that that creates a cliff and we need to do everything we can to work with providers and provide them the resources to help to avoid that clip.,,,
1680,0.9101080894470215,8654.0,8664.7,So this is a conversation with this is a conversation with the providers to really sort of hit that sweet spot.,,,
1681,0.9101080894470215,8664.7,8668.8,If you will in terms of filling turned over units.,,,
1682,0.7350035309791565,8671.4,8672.5, I'm councilmember her bold.,,,
1683,0.7350035309791565,8672.5,8673.3,You have a question.,,,
1684,0.8863796591758728,8676.6,8677.6," Yeah, I do.",,,
1685,0.8863796591758728,8677.6,8678.2,Thank you.,,,
1686,0.8863796591758728,8678.6,8680.7,And I'm sorry if this has been addressed already.,,,
1687,0.8863796591758728,8681.1,8686.9,I had some additional technical difficulties.,,,
1688,0.8863796591758728,8688.7,8706.0,"So I know we're dealing with the question of throughput in a lot of different places and I thought I heard that part of the idea of creating more capacity, in permanent Supportive Housing is two pair.",,,
1689,0.9128384590148926,8706.5,8723.6," Um, rapid rehousing with HUD vouchers in the idea that people would move out of permit Supportive Housing using the HUD vouchers and the rapid rehousing pairing.",,,
1690,0.7331452369689941,8725.8,8727.6, And that's creating more spaces.,,,
1691,0.7331452369689941,8727.6,8729.0,In permanent Supportive Housing.,,,
1692,0.7331452369689941,8729.0,8730.7,Did I did I hear that correctly?,,,
1693,0.7952771782875061,8731.9,8746.3," That's correct councilmember, so it's called a move on strategy, which is a practice developed by Corporation for Supportive Housing and a number of other permanent Supportive Housing developers providers and ta providers.",,,
1694,0.7952771782875061,8747.2,8751.0,That we're over time long long periods of time.,,,
1695,0.7952771782875061,8751.0,8753.0,"I want to be clear, we're not talking about like a couple years.",,,
1696,0.7952771782875061,8753.9,8761.6,People stabilize and need fewer per supports and may be able to transition into more community-based.,,,
1697,0.9128382802009583,8761.8,8762.4, Etcetera.,,,
1698,0.9128382802009583,8763.1,8766.5,But do not have the economic wherewithal to do.,,,
1699,0.9128382802009583,8766.5,8767.0,So.,,,
1700,0.9128382802009583,8767.9,8775.2,"So a by attaching another long-term subsidy, but one that does not have right.",,,
1701,0.9128382802009583,8775.8,8778.5,The service component wired into it.,,,
1702,0.9128382802009583,8778.6,8786.1,We create capacity in the permanent Supportive Housing stock for people who do have very complex needs to then move in.,,,
1703,0.7846994400024414,8787.2,8800.3, So do we have data that demonstrates that even after several years that people can and do move out of permanent Supportive Housing.,,,
1704,0.7846994400024414,8800.3,8807.3,"I mean, one of my favorite quotes by my favorite stats that I use all the time to talk about why we need to double our investment.",,,
1705,0.7846994400024414,8807.3,8813.7,In permanent Supportive Housing is that 97 percent of people who get into permanent Supportive Housing stay in it.,,,
1706,0.7846994400024414,8813.9,8816.0,And so I'm just wondering what are we basing?,,,
1707,0.7846994400024414,8816.0,8816.7,This Theory?,,,
1708,0.8322875499725342,8817.0,8829.6, That people will move out of permanent Supportive Housing because it's my understanding that the population and the needs associated with those folks is not just about stabilization.,,,
1709,0.8322875499725342,8830.7,8836.3,It's about needs that many of these people will have for for the long term.,,,
1710,0.8322875499725342,8837.1,8837.4,Yeah.,,,
1711,0.8322875499725342,8837.4,8838.6,I think that's a great question.,,,
1712,0.8322875499725342,8838.6,8839.9,I will be clear.,,,
1713,0.8322875499725342,8839.9,8846.2,"I can't speak to the local data yet because I don't directly oversee, it will soon and then I can answer that question more detail.",,,
1714,0.7594032287597656,8847.1,8856.8, But I will say that the National Data is clear that there is a possibility of turnover in the permanent Supportive Housing space.,,,
1715,0.7594032287597656,8857.1,8858.3,"Its again, I want to be really clear.",,,
1716,0.7594032287597656,8858.3,8860.0,"We're not talking about 50%, Right?",,,
1717,0.7594032287597656,8860.0,8868.8,"Like we are talking about a subset of people who stabilize and activate typically natural or community supports, right?",,,
1718,0.7594032287597656,8869.4,8873.4,"Where they could leave Supportive Housing, permanent Supportive Housing, right?",,,
1719,0.7594032287597656,8873.8,8876.7,But that there is there still a need for,,,
1720,0.912400484085083,8876.9,8877.6, Support.,,,
1721,0.912400484085083,8878.2,8881.5,"And, and that's what's missing right from their ability to exit.",,,
1722,0.912400484085083,8882.4,8887.0,"And I'm assuming that these, this New Rapid rehousing would not be,",,,
1723,0.8866844177246094,8888.1,8907.1," Term-limited the way the current program is because because then you're saying not only can these folks move out of permanent Supportive Housing, but they can, once in, once they have a HUD voucher that subsidizes their housing and they're also going to get the rapid rehousing voucher.",,,
1724,0.8866844177246094,8907.1,8908.8,"On top of that, that one day.",,,
1725,0.8866844177246094,8908.8,8911.7,They won't need that rapid rehousing voucher either.,,,
1726,0.8866844177246094,8911.7,8916.4,So if it's term limit if it's not then that's not a problem.,,,
1727,0.8866844177246094,8917.2,8917.7,"Yeah, so",,,
1728,0.7906314134597778,8917.9,8923.2," Not talking about applying the rapid rehousing, voucher the rapid rehousing dollars to folks.",,,
1729,0.7906314134597778,8923.2,8928.5,"We're talking about using emergency housing vouchers, which are 10 years and frankly.",,,
1730,0.7906314134597778,8928.5,8933.5,Our expectation is that they will they will become permanent.,,,
1731,0.7906314134597778,8933.5,8937.0,I think I think that is what we have received as sort of telegraph from HUD.,,,
1732,0.7906314134597778,8937.0,8946.9,"Is that like we should we should look at this as a resource that is likely to become stable in our in our resource pool, right, but I will be super clear.",,,
1733,0.7906314134597778,8947.0,8947.7,We would not support.,,,

1736,0.7412912845611572,8959.1,8959.7,Very helpful.,,,

1740,0.7412912845611572,8973.6,8974.7,There's a few more things.,,,
1741,0.7412912845611572,8974.7,8977.7,I just wanted clarification on before we.,,,
1742,0.9128384590148926,8977.9,8994.8," Part ways this afternoon first, you know as was stated in the public comment, Jacob Thorpe on my staff and I had the opportunity to go visit the new Nickelsville Village in the Central District.",,,
1743,0.9128384590148926,8995.0,9001.1,It was it was good to meet with those folks and just hear about their transition to the new location.,,,
1744,0.9128384590148926,9001.4,9007.7,One of the things I was surprised to hear about where I think we could assist as a city family Fairly.,,,
1745,0.9128384590148926,9007.8,9018.6, The expeditiously is that that encampment is being charged for utilities currently and that that is apparently a big hardship on the Campers at that location or the villagers.,,,
1746,0.9128384590148926,9018.6,9019.1,I should say.,,,
1747,0.9128384590148926,9019.1,9020.2,Sorry at that location.,,,
1748,0.9128384590148926,9020.9,9031.9,"I did want to flag because the, the council has appropriated that eight hundred thousand dollar budget item for support for Resident manage Villages.",,,
1749,0.9128384590148926,9032.7,9037.6,It seems like we should hopefully be able to build a consensus on on during the,,,

1751,0.8987390995025635,9041.3,9046.8,And I just wonder if we could work together on figuring figuring out a way to solve for that.,,,
1752,0.8987390995025635,9046.8,9054.4,"And potentially looking at that 800,000 as a way to solve for, at least this utility issue going forward.",,,
1753,0.8987390995025635,9054.4,9060.6,So I just wanted to post that to test real quick here since that was an issue that was raised.,,,
1754,0.8987390995025635,9060.6,9062.2,That seems somewhat exigent.,,,
1755,0.827814519405365,9063.5,9064.4," Yeah, I'm great.",,,
1756,0.827814519405365,9065.2,9066.4,Thanks for the question.,,,
1757,0.827814519405365,9066.6,9075.4,So HST has absolutely met with share and with Nickelsville to talk more about the stealth managed encampments.,,,
1758,0.827814519405365,9076.5,9093.1,"So the city asks for master service agreement or fiscal sponsor, in order to invest our funds and we have discussed with both of those groups and talk to them about getting prepared to take on an MSA there.",,,
1759,0.8080946803092957,9093.3,9103.2," Are a couple of different ways that we've identified for share wheel over the years to subcontract to, excuse me, to work with us.",,,
1760,0.8080946803092957,9103.2,9116.0,"What is they have a subcontract with Catholic Community Service for their Fiscal Agent, that certainly could be expanded if CCS were interested in that.",,,
1761,0.8080946803092957,9117.4,9123.1,We have shared the MSA the master service agreement information with,,,
1762,0.8795893788337708,9123.2,9129.5, Chair and Nichols Bill and are encouraging them to consider pursuing that option.,,,
1763,0.8795893788337708,9129.5,9137.8,I will say that HST has been paying directly for some of the Northlake operating cost of utilities waste removal.,,,
1764,0.8795893788337708,9137.8,9140.7,And while that's not ideal.,,,
1765,0.8795893788337708,9141.3,9145.1,This definitely has kept people on that site during the pandemic.,,,
1766,0.838706374168396,9147.8,9148.0, All right.,,,
1767,0.838706374168396,9148.0,9156.5,"Well, let's continue to work on that going forward and figure out a way to solve for some of those issues with, with Nickelsville.",,,
1768,0.838706374168396,9156.5,9158.1,Thanks for that answer.,,,
1769,0.838706374168396,9158.1,9165.1,And also going into a little of the history and using the Fiscal Agent and how we manage that relationship in the past.,,,
1770,0.838706374168396,9166.1,9176.7,"I before we get off tiny house, Villages, my last question today and then I'll turn over because I know councilmember scada and maybe councilmember her bold, have some final questions and then they those",,,
1771,0.8849859237670898,9176.9,9182.9, With the final questions because this is my last one that I want to ask.,,,
1772,0.8849859237670898,9183.0,9184.8,There are three additional Villages.,,,
1773,0.8849859237670898,9184.8,9194.6,The council funded through the American Recovery plan and fully funded for 2021.,,,
1774,0.8849859237670898,9196.2,9197.2,We have a timeline.,,,
1775,0.8849859237670898,9197.2,9204.1,"Now on the three, general fund 2021, Villages that looked to be opening in October.",,,
1776,0.9096622467041016,9206.6,9211.5, I would like an update from hsd on implementing.,,,
1777,0.9096622467041016,9211.5,9212.9,The additional three villages.,,,
1778,0.9096622467041016,9213.9,9216.0,We did hear from one provider today.,,,
1779,0.9096622467041016,9216.0,9225.9,"And and you know, Lehigh is not the only provider who could do this work, but we did hear from Lehigh saying they have kept at making the claim in the public comment that they have the capacity.",,,
1780,0.9096622467041016,9226.4,9235.6,If there were an RFP they could apply to set up Villages it so it doesn't seem like it would be provider capacity.,,,
1781,0.8308762907981873,9236.0,9239.5, That would be a delay on being able to have a successful bid.,,,
1782,0.8308762907981873,9239.8,9256.5,"I just wanted to throw it out there because as council member Peterson said earlier, you know, the tiny houses to support several additional Villages are completed is just a matter of securing the side, securing the provider getting it, contracted getting it on the ground.",,,
1783,0.8308762907981873,9257.4,9261.1,So I did just want to ask for those additional three villages.,,,
1784,0.8308762907981873,9262.6,9265.8,What can the council expect in terms of action from?,,,
1785,0.7469152808189392,9265.9,9273.4," Hsd or the regional authority to follow up on that funding and the funding, I should add from our state Partners who put two million dollars in time.",,,
1786,0.8233305811882019,9275.0,9281.7," Yeah, I'm happy to kick that off and then Mark happy for your perspective on this as well.",,,
1787,0.8233305811882019,9282.5,9285.6,So indeed there is funding.,,,
1788,0.8233305811882019,9285.6,9303.8,"It is one time funding which means that those are dollars that we can use to stand up the villages and what unfortunately, we don't have at this time is a commitment of the operating funds for us to be able to",,,
1789,0.8239386081695557,9303.9,9306.1, Put out a request for proposals.,,,
1790,0.8239386081695557,9306.4,9310.3,We really need to have a full commitment of funding.,,,
1791,0.8239386081695557,9310.3,9319.1,We typically look at a minimum of three years of operating funds before we actually will put an RFP out.,,,
1792,0.8239386081695557,9319.2,9333.3,"That's not just sort of good stewardship of public dollars, but it's also an assurance for those providers that are going to put their energy into replying to the RFP that in fact, there is a project there.",,,
1793,0.8239386081695557,9333.3,9333.7,There's,,,
1794,0.8425135612487793,9333.8,9354.6, Oh there there so to speak and that they can then put their energy into planning for the Long Haul with those projects that's critical to the kind of proposal that they put forward and to our ability to evaluate that as well on the state's two million dollars.,,,
1795,0.8425135612487793,9355.1,9358.0,"Indeed, those funds definitely exist.",,,
1796,0.8425135612487793,9358.4,9363.7,They also have a full funding requirement before we can pull those.,,,
1797,0.8358374238014221,9363.9,9364.6, Dollars down.,,,
1798,0.8358374238014221,9364.6,9369.5,"They are a reimbursement Grant, and the state's requirements.",,,
1799,0.8358374238014221,9369.5,9383.4,"Are that there be a site control of a property, either through a long-term lease or purchase, but more importantly, that all the Project funding is identified and committed.",,,
1800,0.8358374238014221,9384.1,9393.7,"So those are immediately for us some of the constraining factors, but Mark, I'd I would love for you to add.",,,
1801,0.837120532989502,9393.8,9406.6," Add the authorities perspective, as these funds and projects will come under your roof soon, one, and test that you before, I want to just clarify, but then I do certainly want to hear from Mark.",,,
1802,0.837120532989502,9406.6,9412.4,"But I disagree with the contention, that these Villages aren't fully funded you.",,,
1803,0.837120532989502,9412.4,9418.1,I could certainly bring in bringing the budget chair to clarify on that.,,,
1804,0.837120532989502,9418.1,9423.7,But I think that we did UND for Capital and operations for the pendency of 2021.,,,
1805,0.911962628364563,9424.0,9427.7, We since we haven't written the 2022 budget yet.,,,
1806,0.8937821388244629,9428.9,9442.2," You know, we don't we don't have the operating money to go into the future, but we wouldn't have funded the operations if we didn't for 2021, if we didn't intend to also operate those Villages for 2022.",,,
1807,0.8937821388244629,9442.2,9456.7,"So I do just want to say, I don't, I don't understand how these next three villages are differently, situated from the, from the other three in terms of being considered fully funded.",,,
1808,0.8937821388244629,9457.2,9458.5,"I mean, it, I",,,
1809,0.780897319316864,9458.7,9459.9, Citizen fully funded.,,,
1810,0.780897319316864,9460.2,9465.4,"I don't want to speak for council members scada, but I'm sure she does and and I'm gonna turn it over to her in a second.",,,
1811,0.780897319316864,9465.4,9481.0,"If she has a question, but I just wanted to throw that out there that, you know, I don't know what you, you need to see from the council for us to demonstrate that that we are willing to sustain those additional three villages in the future years, but we're happy to do.",,,
1812,0.780897319316864,9481.3,9488.5,"I would imagine we would be happy to consider a process to to make that clear and I don't want to speak for all my colleagues, but I",,,
1813,0.9128385782241821,9488.6,9490.9, I think we would probably have five votes.,,,
1814,0.9128385782241821,9493.1,9494.8,I would hate for that to be a reason.,,,
1815,0.9128385782241821,9494.8,9496.8,We don't build those three villages.,,,
1816,0.9128385782241821,9498.2,9500.6,So I just wanted to ask for that clarification.,,,
1817,0.9128385782241821,9500.9,9506.6,"Yeah, so the the council absolutely allocated funding for three villages.",,,
1818,0.9128385782241821,9506.6,9513.3,Those are the three villages that we are working on and great foresight and making sure that there was ongoing operating funds.,,,
1819,0.9128385782241821,9513.3,9517.1,Those operating funds are for those three villages that were currently standing up.,,,
1820,0.8017264008522034,9518.9,9523.7, And at this point and I understand the council's commitment to Villages.,,,
1821,0.8017264008522034,9523.7,9524.9,At this point.,,,
1822,0.8017264008522034,9524.9,9537.5,"We do not have budget Authority in 2021 or 2022 for new Villages for ongoing funding, for new Villages.",,,
1823,0.8017264008522034,9537.6,9548.6,"And as I can and I will confess that I may not fully understand all the nuances of the budgeting process, but those ongoing do",,,
1824,0.8834759593009949,9548.7,9557.0," There's I'm assuming would be potentially part of the 2022, budget and likely to be approved in November.",,,
1825,0.8834759593009949,9557.0,9577.4,"And at that point, we would consider those Villages or the RFP to seek new Villages or alternative non-congregate shelter fully funded what will tip it to to Mark here, but I do just want to do a call out if Jeff Sims or Ali Panucci or listening if you could maybe get in here to clarify this because I",,,
1826,0.8488126397132874,9578.6,9581.2, Don't know if that's actually the case test.,,,
1827,0.8488126397132874,9581.2,9588.2,"I think that they are fully funded but the Assumption was, if they were operational, they'd only be operational for a month.",,,
1828,0.8488126397132874,9588.2,9591.4,"So they're funded, you know, at a lower for two months.",,,
1829,0.8488126397132874,9591.7,9599.1,"Councilmember mosquitoes is my me, so it's so they are fully funded.",,,
1830,0.8488126397132874,9599.1,9608.5,"But with the Assumption, they'd only be open for two months and then for 2022, we would fully fund them for the whole year of 2022, but but I'll, I'll wait for Jeff.",,,
1831,0.8141292929649353,9608.7,9610.5, Or a lie to appear.,,,
1832,0.8141292929649353,9610.7,9613.2,"And in the meantime, I will turn that over to mark.",,,
1833,0.849419355392456,9614.9,9616.0, Thank you guys member.,,,
1834,0.849419355392456,9616.0,9623.2,I would be also interested in being and I don't know if we'll have time today and this session.,,,
1835,0.849419355392456,9623.2,9627.0,So perhaps it's a meeting and then coming back to clarify for the public.,,,
1836,0.849419355392456,9627.0,9644.0,But it would be helpful for me also to understand what comes in the mosquitoes referencing in terms of two months in sort of what what what you all are thinking with regard to the budget cycle because I will say that in our team's analysis.,,,
1837,0.8930465579032898,9644.2,9647.7, We also came to the conclusion.,,,
1838,0.8930465579032898,9647.7,9651.1,This was one time funding and in the preparation.,,,
1839,0.8930465579032898,9651.1,9654.6,I will be just very candid in the preparation of my inaugural budget.,,,
1840,0.8930465579032898,9654.7,9660.5,My board will not will not move forward with something that is that is one time funding as Program stand up.,,,
1841,0.8930465579032898,9660.5,9663.3,And in order for my budget to be activated.,,,
1842,0.8930465579032898,9663.3,9666.6,"It has to go through first, my board and then the governing committee for approval, right?",,,
1843,0.8930465579032898,9666.6,9673.5,"Which and and I II in Candor believe that this would be a non-starter, as it is currently structured.",,,
1844,0.9128382802009583,9674.3,9684.9," And so would, you know, welcome the opportunity to have that conversation but I also will say that again in Candor.",,,
1845,0.9128382802009583,9685.2,9697.7,"I would like to think about two things, one, if we're using again, if we're using one-time dollars, can we use them to generate flow through my, one of my board chairs lives in a tiny home?",,,
1846,0.9128382802009583,9698.0,9700.0,"He's spoke earlier, right?",,,
1847,0.9128382802009583,9701.3,9704.0,"I think, I think we could do some really incredible.",,,
1848,0.7832661867141724,9704.2,9711.9, Couple things with one-time money to attach it to the villages to get people into other housing.,,,
1849,0.7832661867141724,9712.8,9721.5,"And then, I think the other thing that that, you know, I would sort of raises is that the kind of program expansion that discussing today.",,,
1850,0.7832661867141724,9722.5,9733.9,"I would want to understand much more deeply with regard to outcomes and, and expectations before we talked about the scaling that is",,,
1851,0.7829811573028564,9734.1,9734.8, under discussion.,,,
1852,0.7829811573028564,9734.8,9740.8,"And that's, that's just that, that is in Candor where I'm at as a system administrator, right?",,,
1853,0.7829811573028564,9740.8,9755.9,"I do not think that, I understand at the level that I need to, or that my chief program officer needs to what what the outcomes that were after our in terms of exit and permanency.",,,
1854,0.7829811573028564,9756.9,9764.0,And so those are those are my thoughts at this point with regard to this conversation in terms of its transition.,,,
1855,0.7685610055923462,9764.1,9765.9, You Us in 22.,,,
1856,0.912838339805603,9768.0,9775.0," So thank you for that Mark, and we're now joined by Central staff, just to clarify, we have Jeff.",,,
1857,0.912838339805603,9775.2,9779.9,I think Ali was going to be joining us to potentially but Jeff.,,,
1858,0.912838339805603,9780.5,9783.7,"I don't know if you were following the discussion earlier, but we're discussing.",,,
1859,0.8895628452301025,9784.5,9813.7," Whether or not the three American Recovery Act Villages are fully funded for it mean capital and operations for 20, 21, and I think there's been a little bit of a dispute because, you know, at least the capital is, is one-time money, but our understanding as a council is that there is operations money, assuming two months, assuming that under the most generous of timelines.",,,
1860,0.8895628452301025,9813.7,9814.2,They could be,,,
1861,0.8422667384147644,9814.6,9825.7," For two months this year and there's a dispute on whether that constitutes full funding, but I just wanted to turn it over to you guys since you're, you know, you're the budget writers here.",,,
1862,0.8422667384147644,9825.9,9829.4,So what you described council member or a chair it is correct.,,,
1863,0.8422667384147644,9829.4,9836.9,We did provide four hundred thousand dollars of American Recovery Act funds or see our work rescue plan funds in the package.,,,
1864,0.8422667384147644,9836.9,9839.2,That was adopted by the council and signed by the mayor.,,,
1865,0.8422667384147644,9839.4,9844.4,"And that could provide, you could mix and match how Like a Village open October and summoned.",,,
1866,0.8065345883369446,9844.5,9844.9, December.,,,
1867,0.8065345883369446,9844.9,9850.2,You can mix and match how long Services could be provided for those units per.,,,
1868,0.8065345883369446,9850.2,9851.2,I'm not clear enough.,,,
1869,0.8065345883369446,9851.6,9852.7,I wasn't able to sponsor likes.,,,
1870,0.8065345883369446,9852.7,9857.1,"My internet was cutting out side, was falling on my phone and might have missed a sentence or two here or there.",,,
1871,0.8065345883369446,9857.5,9864.6,"But um, my what it sounded like test you were saying was that looking for fully funding for future years as well.",,,
1872,0.8065345883369446,9864.6,9871.9,You made a statement about three years of funding at this point that counsel has not provided ongoing funding for The Villages.,,,
1873,0.8065345883369446,9872.2,9874.3,"So, I'm not familiar with the",,,
1874,0.784091591835022,9874.6,9878.9," The terms and conditions of the state funds, I can't speak to that test would be better equipped to do.",,,
1875,0.784091591835022,9878.9,9890.8,"So, but if that's the level requirement, I would say that we have not provided a full year of funding a 2022 or funding that we have denoted as being ongoing funds and a budget action.",,,
1876,0.784091591835022,9890.8,9904.2,"So that wouldn't have been met, but we definitely would have provided funds for three villages to if it was feasible to open them to operate for some period of time in 2020 2021, Jeff just to clarify though, on that.",,,
1877,0.9128387570381165,9904.5,9913.6, Does that mean that we've provided three years worth of operational funding for the other three villages from the 2021 budget?,,,
1878,0.9128387570381165,9913.7,9920.0,I didn't realize that we had to fund that deeply into the future to sustain any of these shelter Investments.,,,
1879,0.9128387570381165,9921.4,9922.6,I would actually disagree with that.,,,
1880,0.9128387570381165,9922.6,9923.9,We've ever done that.,,,
1881,0.9128387570381165,9924.3,9927.6,"The, our budgets that most are funded on a biennium basis.",,,
1882,0.9128387570381165,9927.6,9930.0,We'd never have had a three-year budget to my knowledge.,,,
1883,0.9128387570381165,9930.6,9931.3,And too often.,,,
1884,0.9128387570381165,9931.3,9933.7,We were doing our annual budget Appropriations.,,,
1885,0.9128387570381165,9933.7,9934.0,"So,",,,
1886,0.8432517647743225,9934.8,9938.8, I think it'd be inaccurate to say that we have secured funding that would be committing.,,,
1887,0.8432517647743225,9938.9,9941.5,Future councils to funding decisions.,,,
1888,0.8432517647743225,9941.5,9942.0,I don't know.,,,
1889,0.8432517647743225,9942.0,9944.7,I Varsity attorneys could probably weigh in and tell us that we can't do that.,,,
1890,0.8432517647743225,9944.7,9952.9,"I'm not positive, but I think that it would be inaccurate to say that we've secured an advanced three years of funding for any other villages to open.",,,
1891,0.8432517647743225,9954.0,9956.9,"Okay, councilmember Mesquita, you've been so patient.",,,
1892,0.8432517647743225,9956.9,9961.8,"I want to turn it over to you, maybe initially to weigh in, on this particular issue.",,,
1893,0.8432517647743225,9961.8,9963.4,So we can resolve it before we move on.,,,
1894,0.8432517647743225,9963.4,9964.5,I don't want to get too bogged down.,,,
1895,0.8919166326522827,9964.7,9965.3, The spot.,,,
1896,0.8919166326522827,9965.6,9969.6,"But I, of course, since you're the budget chair, you know, what turned over to?",,,
1897,0.8919166326522827,9970.1,9971.3,"Yeah, thank you very much, mr.",,,
1898,0.8919166326522827,9971.3,9974.6,Chair and appreciate a leapin and she and Jeff Sims also being on the line.,,,
1899,0.8919166326522827,9974.6,9986.6,"I would also appreciate additional technical response from the central staffs perspective to, but I think as the good chair has noted we have never provided more than one year's worth of funding.",,,
1900,0.8919166326522827,9986.8,9988.6,We operate in a one year.,,,
1901,0.8919166326522827,9988.6,9989.9,Calendar your budget.,,,

1903,0.9015554785728455,9994.6,9997.2, A true biennial budget that the council passes.,,,
1904,0.9015554785728455,9997.2,9999.7,We never allocated funding in future years.,,,
1905,0.9015554785728455,9999.7,10004.3,"We cannot commit future councils to funding that, they then have to authorize.",,,
1906,0.9015554785728455,10004.6,10006.8,This is not up for debate.,,,
1907,0.9015554785728455,10006.8,10008.8,This is not up for discussion.,,,
1908,0.9015554785728455,10009.0,10019.9,"The council passed a budget Bill and it was signed by the mayor, the direction from the legislative branch with the signature from the executive was that we were going to stand up.",,,

1910,0.867777407169342,10025.2,10033.8, But the creation of over three with the two million dollars that we have pulled from the state's appropriation to support tiny homes.,,,
1911,0.867777407169342,10033.8,10034.9,During this crisis.,,,
1912,0.867777407169342,10035.0,10043.9,We have provided the sufficient funding based on conversations that we had with the executive and departments about how much it would cost to operate and we know as Jeff Simpsons.,,,
1913,0.867777407169342,10043.9,10049.2,"Just summarized that when you average it out, we expect there to be around two months of operational.",,,
1914,0.867777407169342,10049.3,10052.6,Tiny homes created at least three villages this year.,,,

1916,0.8556733727455139,10054.7,10059.1, He puts forward the funding that the city has already authorized.,,,
1917,0.8556733727455139,10059.2,10060.4,"And again, I want to underscore.",,,
1918,0.8556733727455139,10060.4,10062.6,This is a bill that was signed by the mayor.,,,
1919,0.8556733727455139,10062.8,10075.3,"This is not a time for debating or discussing what additional policies, we should be layering on which I am all in for you seen this Council of provide as just summarized 45 million dollars to address this most pressing crisis.",,,
1920,0.8556733727455139,10075.5,10077.7,We are going to continue to add funding to this.,,,
1921,0.8556733727455139,10077.7,10081.9,But this is truly a question of when are we going to get the tiny homes?,,,
1922,0.8556733727455139,10081.9,10084.6,That the legislative branch has authorized and the,,,
1923,0.5470497012138367,10084.7,10085.6, of has sign.,,,
1924,0.8416770696640015,10086.7,10088.4, This is not a discussion point.,,,
1925,0.8416770696640015,10088.4,10090.9,I would like an answer for when that's going to be stood up.,,,
1926,0.7824621200561523,10094.1,10100.9, So I am going to need to defer to conversation that I must have with CBO.,,,
1927,0.7824621200561523,10100.9,10112.6,"My understanding is that the three villages that currently exists have were allocated with one-time funding for stand-up, and ongoing funding for operations?",,,
1928,0.7824621200561523,10114.2,10123.8,"And we do not have a similar sort of ongoing operating funding source for any new Villages, but I am going to",,,
1929,0.8836276531219482,10124.0,10131.0, We defer to my colleagues at CBO to make sure that I am not overstepping.,,,
1930,0.8836276531219482,10131.0,10133.2,And what I'm saying Jeff.,,,
1931,0.8836276531219482,10133.2,10134.5,Do you have a follow-up on that?,,,
1932,0.8836276531219482,10134.5,10137.4,And then I want to do just a few remarks to close this out.,,,
1933,0.8836276531219482,10137.4,10142.5,"I don't want to get bogged down here and stay till you know, well into, you know, happy hour time.",,,
1934,0.8836276531219482,10142.5,10142.8,So.,,,
1935,0.8836276531219482,10142.8,10146.5,"Jeff Gordon, we don't have to get CPR online to answer that question.",,,
1936,0.8836276531219482,10146.5,10151.2,So and for to make it make sure it's clear all referred to the question of the villages.,,,
1937,0.8836276531219482,10151.2,10153.7,"So the one in the you District Roosevelt at Rosie's,",,,

1939,0.7703801989555359,10159.1,10160.3,Test was correct.,,,

1941,0.7703801989555359,10170.8,10174.9,Obviously that hasn't been achieved and then it has discussed and we're getting better.,,,
1942,0.7703801989555359,10175.7,10181.4,"The, the additional three villages that could be supported with capital funding from the state.",,,

1945,0.7777985334396362,10190.1,10192.4,It sounds like the nuance and conversation here.,,,
1946,0.7777985334396362,10192.4,10198.1,That might be getting getting conflated or confused is that if I understand test correctly.,,,
1947,0.7777985334396362,10198.1,10200.0,She's saying that they would only look for that.,,,
1948,0.7777985334396362,10200.0,10206.2,They the interpretation of the agreement from the state is that we have to have provided something that is considered ongoing funding.,,,

1950,0.7777985334396362,10206.7,10207.0,Clarify.,,,
1951,0.7777985334396362,10207.0,10208.1,If that's correct test.,,,
1952,0.7777985334396362,10208.3,10211.6,In which case it would be true that we haven't yet met that requirement.,,,
1953,0.7777985334396362,10211.7,10213.7,But also the council has not yet.,,,

1956,0.8070446252822876,10223.3,10228.4, I think that where we're at with us and like just to pause on and Jeff.,,,
1957,0.8070446252822876,10228.4,10230.8,Thank you so much for that clarification.,,,
1958,0.8070446252822876,10231.6,10246.3,I think that we have to do a little bit of work here to just finesse what the exact issues are because I mean I firmly believe that the council did fully fund those villages in every respect of funding them.,,,
1959,0.8070446252822876,10247.4,10251.9,"That that just shows that we have every intent of doing ongoing funding, I think.",,,

2016,0.8866367340087891,10584.2,10588.6,Sort of like a House of Commons House of Lords veto gate system.,,,

2018,0.8866367340087891,10591.6,10593.5,"I mean, I would just say to close it out.",,,

2024,0.7716986536979675,10620.4,10626.9,And I think that there is support frankly on those boards for tiny house pillages.,,,

2034,0.773698091506958,10664.5,10675.4," Try and understand if this is a state requirement, if something as simple as a letter of interest in continuing funding and 2022, from the existing Council would be sufficient.",,,
2035,0.773698091506958,10675.4,10677.3,So that we can start standing these up this year.,,,
2036,0.773698091506958,10677.4,10678.5,That's a question.,,,

2041,0.904358983039856,10700.9,10707.8,But I will say the other pretty big sticking point on this is having the site identified and under control.,,,
2042,0.8885905146598816,10709.0,10713.6," Okay, I do want to underscore the importance of moving as fast as we can, given the covid variant.",,,
