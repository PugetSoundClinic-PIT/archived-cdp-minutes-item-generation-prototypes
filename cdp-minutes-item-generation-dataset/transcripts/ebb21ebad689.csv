58,0.97,386.119,392.925,Thank you for dealing in this morning.,16,,
59,0.97,392.925,397.764,"Pastor Willie seals good morning, followed by Taylor La Terese Warner.",16,,

64,0.97,412.745,423.356,Also asking and thanking the Council to addressing this issue that many nonprofit and other agencies have regarding the added expense of the street vacation.,17,,
65,0.97,423.356,427.794,So I'm asking that the Council the full council would support this effort.,17,,
66,0.97,427.794,442.175,"We all are facing this homeless crisis and we are trying to address it in the best way we know how, and I think this is a great opportunity for the Council to, the whole Council to get on board over great action.",17,,
67,0.97,442.175,458.758,"Our project that we are working with Lehigh on, on 22nd and Terry, with the added Street have a case, it would add additional 23 affordable apartments, moving from four stories to six stories.",17,,

73,0.97,481.28,481.447,,20,,
74,0.97,481.447,481.681,Hi.,21,,
75,0.97,481.681,481.981,Thank you.,21,,
76,0.97,481.981,487.653,"My name is Taylor are Terese Warner, I'm an apprentice with local 46.",21,,
77,0.97,487.653,502.401,It is important to all local 46 members that our employers pay for our parking the and I wanted to comment on the suggestion and the memo that this legislation would Incentivize workers to drive who might otherwise use public transportation.,21,,
78,0.97,502.401,513.112,"As workers who have called in before have said, including myself, for the vast majority of the people who work in this industry, public transit is not an option.",21,,
79,0.97,513.112,522.989,So to allow contractors to opt out if they Incentivize public transit would effectively destroy the intent of the legislation.,21,,
80,0.97,522.989,529.295,I also feel like public transit could also be Incentivized.,21,,
81,0.97,529.295,530.062,Some contractors already do both.,21,,
82,0.97,530.062,539.772,And if employers had to cover the cost of parking it might be more concerned about how inflexible transportation is for so many of the workers.,21,,
83,0.97,539.772,546.112,"Also, I urge you to not that I the effective date.",21,,
84,0.97,546.112,556.422,"Local 46 members know when the decisive action is made, which many contractors already have partially in place it takes very little time to the system to assemble themselves.",21,,
85,0.97,556.422,563.663,So all delays read to me as attempts to protect the financial interests of influential people.,21,,
86,0.97,563.663,570.77,Workers really need elected officials to earn our trust in this moment.,21,,
87,0.97,570.77,579.145,So city council members consider themselves to be elected by the people who voted for them or the people who bank roll the billboards and ads.,21,,
88,0.97,579.145,581.247,Local 46 is following this legislation closely.,21,,
89,0.97,581.247,583.349,Thank you for your time.,21,,
90,0.97,583.349,584.283,Thanks very much.,22,,
91,0.97,584.283,588.254,Colin Mullin is listed as not present.,22,,
92,0.97,588.254,599.932,"Colin, if you want to call in, we'll come back to you.",22,,
93,0.97,599.932,600.333,Arthur Esperanza.,22,,
94,0.97,600.333,600.833,"Good morning, Arthur.",22,,
95,0.97,600.833,838.938,Looking for Arthur to pop on the screen were any actual construction workers consulted when drafting it.,22,,
96,0.97,838.938,845.144,Or did you just talk with the AG C? We already have tool storage.,22,,
97,0.97,845.144,849.615,But keeping our tools on one job site only help when we stay on one job site.,22,,
98,0.97,849.615,855.888,"If we work more than one job in one day, we are paying for parking twice too.",22,,
99,0.97,855.888,864.663,"The reality of construction work necessitates cars as our primary transport, whether we pay for parking or not.",22,,
100,0.97,864.663,868.234,You must stop making excuses to back pedal the.,22,,
101,0.97,868.234,880.012,If you really cared about the environment you would never support Billionaires who dump more carbon emissions in one space flight than one family does in.,22,,
102,0.97,880.012,884.717,The memo Referenced is a nonpartisan central staff memo.,23,,
103,0.97,884.717,892.858,And it is a factual document that is not drafted by Council members.,23,,
104,0.97,892.858,894.627,Just as a reminder.,23,,
105,0.97,894.627,909.341,Logan Swann followed by Thatcher Bolden and Dominique Johan Vip and that will continue include the public comment and we'll go back to Patrick burns who signed up for the public hearing.,23,,
106,0.97,909.341,911.31,"Lowing gun, GM, thanks for dialing in.",23,,
107,0.97,911.31,914.68,"Yeah, can you hear me?",24,,
108,0.97,914.68,917.783,"Yes, we can, thanks.",25,,
109,0.97,917.783,918.45,Okay.,26,,
110,0.97,918.45,918.651,Yeah.,26,,
111,0.97,918.651,919.418,My name is Logan.,26,,
112,0.97,919.418,933.832,"I'm a union iron worker here in Seattle and Yeah, I'm just calling to demand that you know there be no delays no watering down of the bill to fully pay for construction workers parking.",26,,
113,0.97,933.832,934.733,It is really cut and dried.,26,,
114,0.97,934.733,941.774,"Either somebody is going to pay for this, and either it is going to be the workers or it is going to be the employers.",26,,
115,0.97,941.774,947.146,In my contract my Union contract we have Player paid parking.,26,,
116,0.97,947.146,950.115,This should be the standard.,26,,
117,0.97,950.115,956.522,"If our you know, contract we can afford to pay surely the electricians contractors can pay it.",26,,
118,0.97,956.522,957.956,Surely the general contractors can pay it.,26,,
119,0.97,957.956,962.094,"Furthermore, they are paying it on the Pl.A.",26,,
120,0.97,962.094,962.528,Jobs already.,26,,
121,0.97,962.528,981.747,"Lick so for you they, there are slides in the presentation you know, you know, saying that you know, that like arguing about the significant of cost for employers, that is good otherwise that is significant cost to working families.",26,,
122,0.97,981.747,987.553,"Overall, I think that these are like paving the way for like watering down the bill.",26,,
123,0.97,987.553,992.324,And it should be passed in full without any amendments that weaken it.,26,,
124,0.97,992.324,997.996,"That give you know, these contractors a way to walk away with more of our money.",26,,
125,0.97,997.996,1014.013,"And Cru, I mean, Furthermore, like referring to Pl.A.S, you know, it already said in the Pl.A.S for the three block radius, and you know, there is an argument being made in this session you know, to expand it to half a mile.",26,,
126,0.97,1014.013,1021.553,"You know, that is a long way, when you are carrying you know, 80-Pound of tools.",26,,
127,0.97,1021.553,1023.655,Daily carrying in your Lunchbox and your tools.,26,,
128,0.97,1023.655,1030.829,"So Yeah, like you know, every week that goes by on this is a week that construction workers are subsidizing contractors.",26,,
129,0.97,1030.829,1036.068,"You know, this is a big issue on family budgets.",26,,
130,0.97,1036.068,1041.14,Over 100-Dollar a week for workers.,26,,

135,0.97,1058.624,1064.296,Which would exempt the affordable housing projects from the requirement to pay fair market value for the underlying land.,28,,
136,0.97,1064.296,1083.649,"Sound transit has had a strong partnership with the city of Seattle and other jurisdictions in using our surplus property for affordable housing including significantly reducing or transferring at no cost property for affordable housing, which is somewhat similar to what is being considered here for transportation Right-Of-Way.",28,,
137,0.97,1083.649,1096.662,We also have property in Seattle that may be of use for affordable housing in the future and those are often adjacent likely God candidates for an alley vacation.,28,,
138,0.97,1096.662,1111.81,"The city contributing the Underlaying values would have real impact, reducing the amount of other subsidies needed to construction affordable housing and making projects more cost effective and thus more competitive for affordable housing project thank you and thank you.",28,,

153,0.97,1191.59,1198.096,So basically the arguments that you have heard from all the other speakers are profound and important.,30,,
154,0.97,1198.096,1210.142,"And it is so important to have a blanket legislation that goes across the city of Seattle, so that employers really understand that they are to provide free parking for their employees.",30,,
155,0.97,1210.142,1219.284,"It takes a lot of stress off the workers, it takes a lot of stress off them with you know, off their budgets.",30,,
156,0.97,1219.284,1226.592,They should not be subsidizing the costs of the employer to do work in Seattle.,30,,
157,0.97,1226.592,1237.135,"So please pass this legislation, and make sure that it does have no loopholes, no Carveouts, so employers can somehow wiggle through this.",30,,

202,0.97,1481.313,1488.253,And who housing is for in the city of Seattle.,39,,
203,0.97,1488.253,1513.812,"I'll note that in a previous career chapter I was also a director for a small worse called the Northwest Association for housing Affordability and I learned more than I really I think wanted to know and thought I would learn at the time about financing for rural affordable housing, which a whole another con none Conundrum for our country for people of modest means.",39,,

206,0.97,1529.394,1535.333,And starting to learn about the various ways with the city of Seattle.,39,,
207,0.97,1535.333,1546.278,"Seattle housing authority and other agencies, try to figure out the Conundrum of making sure that homes and communities are safe and sound for people of limited means in our community.",39,,
208,0.97,1546.278,1569.0,"And that continues to be fundamental if me in a lot of the volunteer work that I do, whether it is with organizations trying to figure out the job access or, in this case, how do we continue to have there be a robust, healthy, decent, dignified community that is fundamentally in our public housing through Seattle housing authority.",39,,
209,0.97,1569.0,1578.376,And the work that Seattle housing authority has done for generations of people in our city continues to be fundamental to who we are as a city.,39,,
210,0.97,1578.376,1594.826,I think what is even more critical as we think about in our city is for lack of a better term thinking more about some of the ways that long-term patterns of racism and institutional structures have kept some people from prosperity.,39,,
211,0.97,1594.826,1597.362,Hav except some people from opportunity.,39,,

216,0.97,1626.558,1637.135,The places they call home and we are in an interesting spot now with the current administration and some opportunities it figure out how we ex span our work.,39,,
217,0.97,1637.135,1645.31,We'll see how long that window lasts and try figure out to take best advantage of that and to particular opportunity.,39,,

222,0.97,1658.256,1666.831,"I think that is a really important point we have seen over the last few decades, where public housing has been dismantled.",40,,
223,0.97,1666.831,1680.111,"Hasn't been reconstructed at the same level as we think of new and innovative ways to make sure there is density, diversity of housing across Seattle, preserving existing housing is an element too.",40,,
224,0.97,1680.111,1684.416,So thanks for bringing that up.,40,,

230,0.97,1711.643,1733.398,"Amazing neighbors and it also provides that ability for people to have affordable housing in neighborhoods that are out of reach for most people and I just want to raise up the importance of that, the Quads and the duplex were incredibly effective at housing multiple people, multiple people in downtown Ballard.",40,,

251,0.97,1880.211,1881.779,Are there any additional questions?,46,,
252,0.97,1881.779,1881.98,Okay.,46,,
253,0.97,1881.98,1885.984,"Council member Clark, I am not seeing any additional questions.",46,,
254,0.97,1885.984,1887.151,Dr.Brandon not seeing any additional questions either.,46,,
255,0.97,1887.151,1892.757,I would underscore some of the points that Council member Clark you made about this moment in time.,46,,
256,0.97,1892.757,1900.231,When the headline this morning talks about more growth in the Seattle populations relative to our regional cities.,46,,
257,0.97,1900.231,1904.869,We have already seen a 21% population increase in the last 10 years and the housing just hasn't caught up.,46,,
258,0.97,1904.869,1927.625,"So I think as you note, we are in a good place for a potential opportunity for Federal partnership with the build back better act, which we all hope will soon pass and the infrastructure bill that just passed, in addition to having legislative body that has been very supportive of additional housing density and capital investments.",46,,
259,0.97,1927.625,1937.802,So are there any other items you are hoping to partner with the city council on in the next year or two that are top priority for you given this moment in time we find ourselves in?,46,,
260,0.97,1937.802,1943.374,"Dr.Brandon, you are welcome to answer that as well as Council member Clark.",46,,
261,0.97,1943.374,1948.646,"I'll go first and Council member Clark, you can also follow if you like.",47,,
262,0.97,1948.646,1951.549,You can't not talk about homelessness.,47,,
263,0.97,1951.549,1959.123,We focus on housing and we have done an excellent job that have and will continue to focus on that.,47,,
264,0.97,1959.123,1964.395,We need to continue to look for bridges and relationships to address the homeless population.,47,,
265,0.97,1964.395,1968.299,So we are working with the regional homeless authority now.,47,,
266,0.97,1968.299,1981.045,"That we are housing folks and will continue to seek out appropriate partnerships like that, that make sense for us to stay in our wheel house and also just to move out and address some critical issues facing the city right now.",47,,
267,0.97,1981.045,1993.725,So that is one I wanted to let you know we are spending lots of time thinking about that and seeking our appropriate role in that with all the other good partners here in Seattle.,47,,
268,0.97,1993.725,1995.86,Not sure I can add.,48,,
269,0.97,1995.86,2006.938,"That is, am excited to dive into that and figure out how to help through the board of commissioners work to support what director Brandton just described.",48,,
270,0.97,2006.938,2016.347,"The other thing I have thought about is, you know, I think through the pandemic we have all had the stress of the work force stress.",48,,
271,0.97,2016.347,2024.055,Who is it who actually does the work if our organizations and how have they Coped and how have they struggled?,48,,
272,0.97,2024.055,2039.57,"And clearly, there are hiring gaps all over our city and I would imagine that I haven't talked about this much with director Brandon, but I've got to imagine s Hais in the same spot, where it has been a stressful couple of years for a variety of reasons.",48,,
273,0.97,2039.57,2047.345,"Staff at the ground-level and doing the work to keep buildings great, to keep community developing with all of the challenges.",48,,
274,0.97,2047.345,2052.75,And so I look forward to learning more about how to support that people infrastructure of Seattle housing authority as well.,48,,
275,0.97,2052.75,2055.153,Thanks for bringing that up.,49,,
276,0.97,2055.153,2068.566,"I think wellness is crucial both for our residents and making sure that we continue to pay attention to them as well as our staff so they can do this in a healthy WII for them and their families, which reflect the communities we live in.",49,,
277,0.97,2068.566,2069.333,Thank you for brining that up.,49,,
278,0.97,2069.333,2072.236,Thank you both very much.,50,,

280,0.97,2077.909,2084.715,We have to have a place for folks to call home in order to solve the crisis of homelessness.,50,,
281,0.97,2084.715,2101.232,While it might not have come through in the most recent articles in the Seattle times the last Council budget we just passed had $156 million toward affordable housing and every word of the homeless investments was Workshopped with the homelessness authority.,50,,
282,0.97,2101.232,2119.016,"So we are very excited to be good partners with R ha, our King County colleagues and look forward to making these investments go further with your support and your work at Seattle housing authority and our congressional actions that we anticipate here very soon.",50,,
283,0.97,2119.016,2125.523,"$56Million in homeless services and shelter in addition to $194 million for housing, twice the amount this we have seen in the last four years.",50,,
284,0.97,2125.523,2133.898,So I'm very optimist and I can look forward to working with all of you to make sure we turn those words on the paper into action in community.,50,,
285,0.97,2133.898,2138.369,"With that, I'm not seeing any additional comments or questions of the okay.",51,,

703,0.97,4801.696,4806.001,So I'm here to present on the share mobility project.,138,,
704,0.97,4806.001,4819.214,This project aims to promote economic advancement of people of color through a shared mobility service contract to be used by city employees for city business travel.,138,,
705,0.97,4819.214,4824.819,"This began in 2018, when assigned Department vehicles and the motor pool vehicles were in high demand.",138,,
706,0.97,4824.819,4829.891,"At the time, FAS had a need to give city employees more travel options.",138,,
707,0.97,4829.891,4845.574,We hoped to improve travel access for employees who did not work near the current motor pool locations or those employees who didn't have access to the assigned Department vehicles across the city.,138,,
708,0.97,4845.574,4853.415,Our Stakeholder outreach and research included engagement with share mobility providers such as local taxi companies.,138,,
709,0.97,4853.415,4862.39,"We engaged motor pool user, Department fleet Coordinators, consumer protection and contracting professionals as well.",138,,
710,0.97,4862.39,4867.863,The strategy we tested was the use of a Seattle account.,138,,
711,0.97,4867.863,4871.299,The strategy Unfortunately did not achieve the goal.,138,,
712,0.97,4871.299,4883.044,We gun the Orange cab pilot we immediately saw the technology disparities between the taxi company that we chose ask the Tncs were an issue.,138,,
713,0.97,4883.044,4890.418,City employees want out based dispatching and the ability to see location Eta and the description of their car and driver.,138,,
714,0.97,4890.418,4901.096,Our orange cab account Ree lied on a call center to dispatch vehicles and the payment by paper voucher.,138,,
715,0.97,4901.096,4903.064,This did not meet the expectations of city employees.,138,,
716,0.97,4903.064,4909.638,"Billing resulted in delays in payments to the drivers themselves, which was actually contrary to the original goal as well.",138,,
717,0.97,4909.638,4916.645,"And finally, the demand for additional transportation option was reduced to basically zero when Covid 19 hit.",138,,
718,0.97,4916.645,4920.115,Our team continues to share our lessons learned with colleagues.,138,,
719,0.97,4920.115,4932.227,We urge colleagues to watch for signs that a strategy isn't working so that they may go back and recycle through the stages of Stakeholder outreach and strategy development to test a new option.,138,,
720,0.97,4932.227,4940.602,"Also, we hope to temper expectations each after all the hard work that goes into a project, it may not achieve the outcome.",138,,
721,0.97,4940.602,4944.506,"At this point, FAS engagement of this topic is currently in King County.",138,,
722,0.97,4944.506,4952.213,Together we are working on policy changes that may lessen the regulatory burden on taxing owners.,138,,
723,0.97,4952.213,4961.923,Structural changes in policy can have lasting impact on the for hire taxi industry.,138,,
724,0.97,4961.923,4963.925,And Phillip.,138,,

730,0.97,4996.624,5010.605,"We want to do this by focusing on targeted outreach and sharing information about surplus and its inventory in advance, so folks will understand what we are offering.",139,,
731,0.97,5010.605,5017.345,We also want to focus becoming more accessible by making it easier to see what we have to offer.,139,,
732,0.97,5017.345,5031.526,We plan to do this by conducting invitations for surplus events that focus on alike our inventory as well as creating schedule 4 appointment.,139,,
733,0.97,5031.526,5042.337,I don't what we have done today is we have developed a bored by using Sigma principles and this is some of the steps and tools we used.,139,,
734,0.97,5042.337,5048.676,We developed a visual board and that basically tells us the work on the various stages.,139,,
735,0.97,5048.676,5059.354,"We also developed a summary, which is a one page document that captures overview, intellectual merits and a broader impact.",139,,
736,0.97,5059.354,5069.697,"We also developed an A-3, also known as a Flowchart to actively collaborate and problem solve on the purpose, goals and strategies.",139,,

779,0.97,5342.603,5350.611,"I have a few questions as well, but I will go after Council member Herbal, please go ahead.",146,,
780,0.97,5350.611,5354.882,I have two categories of questions.,147,,
781,0.97,5354.882,5357.485,The first relates to slide 9.,147,,
782,0.97,5357.485,5368.73,The numbers on the slide were all significantly higher than the numbers I heard being read by the person presenting on the slide.,147,,
783,0.97,5368.73,5371.599,So I don't really understand that.,147,,
784,0.97,5371.599,5388.149,I was having a really hard time tracking what was being said with what was being presented on the Slidement so Maybe we could go back and in there a little bit more.,147,,
785,0.97,5388.149,5422.183,"And to relate specifically to the Cannabis racial equity tool kit, I understand that the equity that was Referenced as part of this presentation notes that of the 48 Cannabis retail stores in Seattle, I'm sorry, 42 yes 42 of the 48 had majority white ownership as of January of 2020.",147,,
786,0.97,5422.183,5428.489,And that there has been a call for these social equity licenses.,147,,
787,0.97,5428.489,5446.207,"And I understand that the barrier to doing that relates to the number of retail stores, not that there is a, there is a defined limit.",147,,
788,0.97,5446.207,5465.092,"But that the issue is that the zone and go land use restrictions make it difficult to cite additional stores that might, in turn, receiving the social equity licenses.",147,,
789,0.97,5465.092,5470.431,So I'm just wondering that there is a decision point in all of 2021.,147,,
790,0.97,5470.431,5476.437,That there is a high level of recommendations for a social equity program coming.,147,,
791,0.97,5476.437,5492.62,Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that and whether or not it addresses some of the land limitations associated with land use in zoning.,147,,
792,0.97,5492.62,5495.089,That is a great question.,148,,
793,0.97,5495.089,5512.039,"So we have actually met with the Seattle Department of construction inspection and they are actually one of our partners for implementation and that is something we are looking at, to change SME of the to the buffer zone.",148,,
794,0.97,5512.039,5513.04,For social equity applicants only.,148,,
795,0.97,5513.04,5517.612,"If we can include race in the equity definition, that is something they are advocating for.",148,,
796,0.97,5517.612,5541.836,"That we will be aligned with the state, once that is defined for social equity applicants and we are asking for either an exemption or those who are social equity applicants to be able to find locations in the zones that are currently prohibited right now.",148,,

803,0.97,5591.953,5600.795,"Part of the request we had in advance was to pull out some of the data so that we could focus on just the purchasing, consulting numbers.",150,,
804,0.97,5600.795,5608.869,"So the numbers that are presented here include as you see the second to the last white women, this is women in Minority-Owned businesses.",150,,
805,0.97,5608.869,5621.148,The usual definition and part of the request we had was to see how we could look just purchasing and consulting so that is part of the reason there is additional information to what the slide noted.,150,,
806,0.97,5621.148,5622.917,Thank you for pulling that data out.,150,,
807,0.97,5622.917,5624.185,So we could see those figures.,150,,

811,0.97,5634.161,5660.755,"Yes, I would and I do apologize though for the confusion for not explaining the differences in providing that additional detail, because yes, it was my intent to share out not just what is shown on this slide that you can read at your leisure, which reflect the percentage of spend within the different race and Ethnicity groups as a percentage of total spend.",151,,
812,0.97,5660.755,5686.313,"And the data that I read, the details that I read and can share out, we can send that via E-mail to you in writing, was the percentage of spend as a percentage of total spend within the purchasing and consultant contracting bucket.",151,,
813,0.97,5686.313,5688.215,Thank you.,152,,
814,0.97,5688.215,5692.62,"So I just trying to tease out intent, on here.",152,,

816,0.97,5707.702,5711.038,"What are we, what is the take away?",152,,
817,0.97,5711.038,5715.476,What should we be measuring?,152,,
818,0.97,5715.476,5724.685,Should we be measuring the spending in purchasing and consulting related specifically to the spend?,152,,
819,0.97,5724.685,5734.361,"Or should we be looking at the spending Department, Department wide?",152,,
820,0.97,5734.361,5748.008,"Given that we are being provided information that shows I think if you do the math, 26% is sorry 36.2% is the total spend for consulting.",152,,
821,0.97,5853.914,5854.081,S.,152,,
822,0.97,5854.081,5855.683,The third and final.,153,,
823,0.97,5855.683,5862.256,"The reason for the bit of confusion on our part was it was a last minute request, frankly, to have those numbers.",153,,
824,0.97,5862.256,5872.466,"So the power point had already been submitted, and Liz, as our division director was verbally report you go out.",153,,

826,0.97,5875.669,5893.153,"As far as I know the only Department who has said we need to go beyond and get to our numbers, we are doing that and hopefully the study will help us materialize that not only for FAS but citywide and may lead to legislation and our Techtive order next year.",153,,
827,0.97,5893.153,5906.233,"Thank you, in no way was my line of questioning Inextended to be at all critical to the presenter or to FAS.",154,,
828,0.97,5906.233,5926.22,"I wanted to hear more and thank you, FAS for going further than required to go as it relates to the reporting on spend and hopefully leading the way for other city Department.",154,,

837,0.97,5957.017,5970.631,"And with the city being as forward thinking as we are, we wanted to handle to deal with the concerns of past practice, what is past practice and current practice.",156,,
838,0.97,5970.631,5980.341,"But what the intent was, prior to legislation, there was more black owners, there was more but once the laws changed, it shifted dramatically.",156,,
839,0.97,5980.341,5991.819,"So what we wanted to do with this equity program is address those issues for the folks who were put out of business, the communities that were harmed and the individuals that were harmed.",156,,
840,0.97,5991.819,6013.107,"But also to look forward to the state's liquor board getting ready to potentially put out about 36 licenses and we are looking at about 12 of those just small numbers here, looking to be in the city of Seattle, which is why we are working with other city departments to welcome those changes.",156,,

1007,0.97,7006.933,7018.077,"Waiving the fee that for that project saved at least $400,000 for affordable housing dollars and helped to create 206 residential units.",201,,
1008,0.97,7018.077,7039.298,"So building on that amendment and that discussion we had last month, the legislation in front of us today takes steps to more concretely put into policy our intent to remove internal barriers to creating affordable housing and allow for us to save precious affordable housing dollars to go directly into creating more homes.",201,,
1009,0.97,7039.298,7069.862,"The legislation Alines with what the council passed in 2018, which was legislation that I sponsored that Prioritized city owned surplus property for building affordable housing and public assets by removing hefty fees charged for areas that the city owns directly, making sure that in this legislation, right of ways are made available to build affordable housing and to create the goal of creating additional opportunities for more folks to live in this city.",201,,
1010,0.97,7069.862,7105.431,"I also NOTE I think it is an efficient and effective way to remove necessary Menstruatetive processes associated with transferring city fund right back to the city and a good example of how the city, state and Federal agencies are working already to exempt some requirements to compensate the city for property values and as a Council, we have the authority to waive these fees under the current excuse me, our current authority to waive these fees for appropriate projects and I look forward to having a more robust discussion with all of you.",202,,
1011,0.97,7105.431,7124.417,I'll save the rest of my comments for the discussion about the bill and possible amendments in front of us and turn it over to you to walk us through.,202,,
1012,0.97,7124.417,7125.852,Council central staff.,203,,
1013,0.97,7125.852,7136.295,This bill AMENDS our Street vacation code to exempt affordable housing from the requirement to pay the appraised value of the Right-Of- way when a street or alley vacation is approved.,203,,
1014,0.97,7136.295,7138.197,Can I pace you really quickly?,204,,
1015,0.97,7138.197,7139.532,Can folks hear okay?,205,,
1016,0.97,7139.532,7145.938,Or maybe just speak up a little bit more.,205,,
1017,0.97,7145.938,7146.606,Thank you so much.,205,,
1018,0.97,7146.606,7155.715,State law allows but does not require the city to require payment of the appraised value of the Right-Of-Way before Street vacations are finalized.,206,,
1019,0.97,7155.715,7166.359,The one exception is shoreline street ends where the city is required under state law to receive the appraised value of the Right-Of-Way.,206,,
1020,0.97,7166.359,7170.263,The city currently Exempts city freight and Federal agencies from paying these costs.,206,,
1021,0.97,7170.263,7178.004,The proposed bill in front of you would also exempt affordable housing projects that receive public funding.,206,,
1022,0.97,7178.004,7188.814,As long as rent and income levels are consistent with the city's housing Fund and policies.,206,,
1023,0.97,7188.814,7201.46,"Fund from street vacations are required to be allocations toward the effect of the bill would be to reduce income to the Department of transportation, but also save affordable housing funding.",206,,
1024,0.97,7201.46,7213.339,And there is one amendment that has been proposed this morning.,207,,
1025,0.97,7213.339,7213.739,Thank you.,208,,
1026,0.97,7213.739,7222.081,And I want to thank Council member Peterson for joining us here today as well.,208,,
1027,0.97,7222.081,7233.225,"And folks for calling in, in support of this effort and pastor seals for really drawing this item to Aur attention earlier this year and dialing in today and expressing support for the legislation.",208,,
1028,0.97,7233.225,7243.636,"Colleagues, I also want to just flesh out a little bit more of what was just noted and then we consider the possible amendment I am aware of this front of us today.",208,,
1029,0.97,7243.636,7246.839,Under our current code as noted.,208,,
1030,0.97,7246.839,7252.311,City funded affordable housing projects are required to pay Street fee vacations.,208,,
1031,0.97,7252.311,7255.014,"Excuse me, pay Street vacation fees.",208,,
1032,0.97,7255.014,7256.916,So limited public housing dollars end up going back to the city.,208,,
1033,0.97,7256.916,7272.531,I think this is a great example of how we can make sure dollars are being used for those affordable housing efforts and the legislation creates an exemption for publicly funded affordable housing projects as defined by the affordable housing funding policies.,208,,
1034,0.97,7272.531,7275.968,This issue was brought to Aur attention by community again.,208,,
1035,0.97,7275.968,7291.183,"Thank you to pastor seals, Lehigh and the work doing on spirit and on church owned properties, especially as has been noted throughout this year in the central district currently.",208,,
1036,0.97,7291.183,7302.762,Tc spirit is an example of a project that requires a street vacation which would cost the appraised value of the site and without it it would create that affordable housing units.,208,,
1037,0.97,7302.762,7307.199,"With the street vacation, they will be able to build 68 affordable housing units.",208,,
1038,0.97,7307.199,7317.61,Thank you to the central staff and the office of housing for working with us and to make sure we were creating a definition of affordable housing within this legislation.,208,,
1039,0.97,7317.61,7321.113,That includes All-Pro Gentex funded by the office of House.,208,,
1040,0.97,7321.113,7324.216,I want to thank Council members here today.,208,,
1041,0.97,7324.216,7335.895,"As the sponsor, officially I will be asking you and then Council member Peterson as I believe a co-author, we will also have you speak to that if you would like to.",208,,
1042,0.97,7335.895,7347.773,"Colleagues, with that, I will turn it over to Council member her bolt to describe the amendment.",208,,
1043,0.97,7347.773,7348.174,Please go ahead.,208,,
1044,0.97,7348.174,7359.985,Again I want to extend my thanks to Councilman Peterson for working to author this amendment and with leash who helped draw this up.,209,,
1045,0.97,7359.985,7362.955,This amendment was a recommendation of the office of housing.,209,,
1046,0.97,7362.955,7383.676,"It would require an I think change for the street vacation waiver that at least 40% of a unit in a project absolute Fordable, in a Linement with the city's housing funding policies, which currently requires Affordability for House olds earning up to 60% of the area median income.",209,,
1047,0.97,7383.676,7392.618,So the existing city housing policies cover the expectation of Affordability up to 60% of area median income.,209,,
1048,0.97,7392.618,7402.661,We are adding with the advice of the office of housing the 40% of the unit's threshold.,209,,
1049,0.97,7402.661,7410.636,Office of housing also flagged the question of whether or not we should include requirement units in question be affordable for a specific period of time.,209,,
1050,0.97,7410.636,7428.254,"Ultimately, we decided against including this language in the amendment, because the legislation already requires alignment with the housing funding policies, which already include a 50 year term of Affordability.",209,,
1051,0.97,7428.254,7454.88,"We were advised that we should work to avoid adding specific terms in the legislation that might create confusion by referring to the existing policies that allows for clarity, but it also allows for some consistency in cases where the policies change, we don't need to go back and change the ordinance.",209,,
1052,0.97,7454.88,7484.376,"Hearing from the office of housing about this amendment, they are not aware of any projects that have received O Hfunding for that have fewer than 40% of units affordable, and they say that with fewer than 40% of units affordable would not be competitive for city funding.",209,,
1053,0.97,7484.376,7492.418,"And so, with that, I again appreciate the efforts of Councilman Peterson and for any additional comments to him.",209,,
1054,0.97,7492.418,7493.853,Thank you very much.,210,,
1055,0.97,7493.853,7494.453,Welcome Councilman Peterson.,210,,

1059,0.97,7507.399,7526.719,"And to our staff for helping us craft this amendment and really, when one of the reasons I'm here is the Seattle Department of Transportation is the dam that receives these Street vacation funds and street vacations go through the transportation committee.",211,,
1060,0.97,7526.719,7531.757,I appreciate recognizing cross cutting of this issue and we had a discussion last week on this.,211,,
1061,0.97,7531.757,7542.601,I did talk with the Seattle Department of transportation to make sure they were okay with this legislation since they would be foregoing revenues because of this.,211,,
1062,0.97,7542.601,7544.87,We are all in this together.,211,,
1063,0.97,7544.87,7551.777,We recognize there is a homelessness crisis and Affordability crisis for housing in the city.,211,,
1064,0.97,7551.777,7555.481,So I appreciate chairman bringing this legislation Forewar.,211,,
1065,0.97,7555.481,7575.968,"This amendment adds at least 40% on our units, because the weight way the slice is originally dropped drafted, gets not just city funding, gets public funding from any source, it could get this exemption and we just want to make sure that we are getting a public benefit in exchange.",211,,
1066,0.97,7575.968,7579.872,"And 40% of the units, that is a good, rational basis for that.",211,,
1067,0.97,7579.872,7586.045,It is the same exemption used for the mandatory housing Affordability program.,211,,
1068,0.97,7586.045,7603.595,"The same percentage used for the popular national program, low income housing program and it is good to have that specificity there in sort of a minimum floor, for what we are expecting for the benefit of affordable housing in exchange for this revenue.",211,,
1069,0.97,7603.595,7604.129,Thank you very much.,211,,
1070,0.97,7604.129,7610.903,Thanks for the discussion you led in our committee as well last week on this topic.,212,,

1074,0.97,7629.488,7652.144,"I think we have heard the 40% threshold would be inclusive of all city funded projects and I want to thank your teams, council member Peterson and Hur bolt for her work on the underlying bill and the research that she has done on this amendment as well, I'll be voting yes.",212,,

1114,0.97,7812.404,7812.805,I appreciate it.,231,,
1115,0.97,7812.805,7818.51,We have one more item on our agenda here today.,232,,
1116,0.97,7818.51,7820.612,Welcome I'm glad you are still here.,232,,
1117,0.97,7820.612,7828.02,Appreciating you being here at the top of the hour and thanks for hanging to the end here.,232,,
1118,0.97,7828.02,7835.794,Could you please read item 1 into the record.,232,,
1119,0.97,7835.794,7849.074,Council will 120213 an ordinance relating to Seattle with requiring employers to provide parking expenses to construction employees working in Seattle for discussion and possible vote.,233,,
1120,0.97,7849.074,7851.343,Thank you very much.,234,,
1121,0.97,7851.343,7853.645,I want to thank Karina for your work.,234,,
1122,0.97,7853.645,7856.448,I see you here with us as well.,234,,
1123,0.97,7856.448,7860.085,We know there is a presentation along with a memo.,234,,
1124,0.97,7860.085,7867.092,"So as that presentation gets pulled up, I'll note the appreciation that has gone into the work on this legislation in front of us.",234,,
1125,0.97,7867.092,7881.94,"We all know we need strong labor standard for our work force, and particularly those working on building our city and making sure there is more affordable housing.",234,,
1126,0.97,7881.94,7884.71,Thank you for your work on the presentation in front of us.,234,,
1127,0.97,7884.71,7899.491,"As I noted earlier all of us know that central staff does not work on policy during the budget and that there is a lot of work that has gone into creating that legislation in front of us, so we could quickly have it in our first committee meeting after budget.",234,,
1128,0.97,7899.491,7907.065,There was a lot of work and hours that went into the presentation here today on this legislation.,234,,
1129,0.97,7907.065,7911.203,"In addition to the would, that happened during the budget period as well.",234,,
1130,0.97,7911.203,7916.975,I will turn it over to Council central staff.,234,,
1131,0.97,7916.975,7929.421,"Before we do, I will ask Council member Sawant if you would like to have any opening comments you are welcome to do that and then maybe we'll pull up the presentation and just confirm with Karina if you are able to pull that up.",234,,
1132,0.97,7929.421,7932.624,We want to confirm that before Council member Sawant concludes.,234,,
1133,0.97,7932.624,7943.068,"Before I turn it over to central staff, thanks for being here with us as the author of this legislation in front of us.",234,,
1134,0.97,7943.068,7945.871,You are welcome to speak to it.,234,,
1135,0.97,7945.871,7951.61,This bill requires contractor bosses to pay the parking costs of the construction workers in Seattle.,235,,
1136,0.97,7951.61,7968.293,This has been a crucial issue in many contract negotiations between building trades Union workers and the Association of General contractors and is an ongoing concern for construction workers in unions and locals.,235,,
1137,0.97,7968.293,7973.966,"For construction workers without the protection of a Union, which there are many, it is an even greater BUR.",235,,
1138,0.97,7973.966,7988.613,"Like prevailing wage loss, which require the city to pay Union wages regardless of Loo a contractor unionized.",235,,
1139,0.97,7988.613,8009.434,It means all workers will get the benefit and unionized workers and Unionss are not placed at a competitive disadvantage to get work and they lose out by implicitly encouraging contractor bosses to hire Nonunion workers.,235,,
1140,0.97,8009.434,8014.84,"Any Asense, the legislation is extremely simple and straightforward.",235,,
1141,0.97,8014.84,8019.144,It requires the construction bosses to pay parking costs rather than workers paying the parking costs.,235,,
1142,0.97,8019.144,8043.201,"Parking costs were one of the major reasons one of the major demands from the recent rank and file strike of 2000 Pacific Northwest Union carpenters, fully funded benefits and improved protections against workplace Harassment.",235,,
1143,0.97,8043.201,8050.709,My office with the carpenters and construction workers request legislation during the courageous strike action in the fall.,235,,
1144,0.97,8050.709,8057.249,"There was no question we, my office strongly supports workers rights and we go out and fight for workers rights.",235,,
1145,0.97,8057.249,8077.769,So we asked for the help of city council staff to drop the bill as soon as possible and so I really appreciate the help of Karina and those of staff for preparing it rapidly.,235,,
1146,0.97,8077.769,8082.874,In October at least 381 working people urged the city council support this paid parking legislation.,235,,
1147,0.97,8082.874,8102.561,"As I mentioned before in briefing sessions, the Monday morning briefing sessions, the community Petitiongarnered housing 100 signatures, 366 of whom are at least the last I checked, which was weeks ago, from construction workers.",235,,
1148,0.97,8102.561,8108.133,Construction workers are often required to drive because they are transporting heavy tools.,235,,
1149,0.97,8108.133,8114.172,"They commute long-distance stances and they start work extremely early in the morning, often before transit lines begin operating.",235,,
1150,0.97,8114.172,8124.149,So this is not a question of whether or not construction workers were drafting work it is a question of who will pay for it when the job requires them to drive to work.,235,,
1151,0.97,8124.149,8133.658,We knew that construction workers had the most power to win paid parking at the height of that struggle during the carpenter strike.,235,,
1152,0.97,8133.658,8143.268,Alongside many construction workers I moved to introduce the bill on October 18.,235,,
1153,0.97,8143.268,8162.02,"However we saw the delays until the movement and I said on October 18, what is a given is that the current movement by working people would be lost and that is just not okay.",235,,
1154,0.97,8162.02,8170.662,It would be an example of the famous quote from Martin Luther King Jr. justice delayed too long is justice demand.,235,,
1155,0.97,8170.662,8184.342,At least 305 working people E- mailed city council in their anger that no Council member was willing to support even the timely presentation of the legislation.,235,,
1156,0.97,8184.342,8187.445,I look forward to hearing about the memo.,235,,
1157,0.97,8187.445,8196.354,But I wanted to quickly report just three of the many hundreds of reports we got.,235,,
1158,0.97,8196.354,8204.663,One is from Christopher Hutchins as an independent Seattle Subcontractor I constantly have to factor in the costs of transportation and parking.,235,,
1159,0.97,8204.663,8223.648,"These costs can lead to individual workers bottom lines in a city that has extracted so much to us due to relentless rent increases, inflated home prices, taking the step to ensure the working people who make Seattle run and go aren't further disadvantaged is critical.",235,,
1160,0.97,8223.648,8223.949,End quote.,235,,
1161,0.97,8223.949,8232.757,Colleen hall from the pile drivers local 2396 says quote the contractors are making millions and maybe billions off the backs of construction workers.,235,,
1162,0.97,8232.757,8240.065,They can pay the Parkers while the workers barely make a livable wage and paying parking is a way to alleviate some stress on the workers.,235,,
1163,0.97,8240.065,8247.939,Please do the right thing and support the very hardworking people who are building Seattle and our future.,235,,
1164,0.97,8247.939,8255.08,"And finally but not least, Brian Eggleston who says here's an example of how expensive parking can be downtown.",236,,
1165,0.97,8255.08,8265.523,"I am a second year apprentice, parking was so expensive, that one full work day's pay went just to pay parking to be at work for the week.",236,,
1166,0.97,8265.523,8272.864,I worked four days a week as an apprentice but only received three days of pay because so much had to go into parking.,236,,
1167,0.97,8272.864,8281.106,So I think those are very important voices from workers of a few of the many voices that we have heard.,236,,
1168,0.97,8281.106,8308.533,"I just finally I wanted to be very clear that to all the workers and community members who supported this legislation who are listening, that the memo was not, the memo that we are going to discuss was not commissioned by my office, and I have more comments when the presentation begins, but just wanted to say Unfortunately, that they are not intent to memo is quite unbalanced.",236,,
1169,0.97,8308.533,8314.806,My staff have asked who requested the certificate if he Cation topics in the memo.,236,,
1170,0.97,8314.806,8316.875,I want to be clear.,236,,
1171,0.97,8316.875,8319.511,I do not know who these Stakeholders are.,236,,
1172,0.97,8319.511,8334.826,As far as I can tell none effort hundreds of workers advocating were consulted.,236,,
1173,0.97,8334.826,8345.27,My staff and I were not.,236,,
1174,0.97,8357.015,8360.452,We are extending our committee meeting today to make sure to include it.,237,,
1175,0.97,8360.452,8365.19,I also want to address the central staff memo and acknowledge that central staff does not work on policy.,237,,
1176,0.97,8365.19,8369.06,They are not expected to work on policy during the budget.,237,,
1177,0.97,8369.06,8389.514,"But my understanding is they did work on policy and I want to appreciate the work not only for the work they have done on the budget for long hours and irregular times that they have to be available to respond to all of us, including me as the budget Claire, to make sure we got through those items on time.",237,,
1178,0.97,8389.514,8394.386,In addition to that I know they were working on this legislation with you and our office.,237,,
1179,0.97,8394.386,8400.024,I want to apply our own values for appreciating the work and labor of our employees as Council members.,237,,
1180,0.97,8400.024,8403.061,We want to apply that to central staff and those in our office.,237,,
1181,0.97,8403.061,8409.534,And I appreciate and acknowledge that there lab additional work that has been provided for this topic specifically.,237,,
1182,0.97,8409.534,8424.516,"I, as the chair of this Committee, often request there to be memos so that we can have a deeper understanding of what legislation is in front of us, especially when we need to have a quick briefing on the legislation given that we were coming off the heels of sessions.",237,,
1183,0.97,8424.516,8428.253,"So absolutely, it is appropriate to have a central staff memo.",237,,
1184,0.97,8428.253,8434.225,This is something that helps inform our colleagues and community about the items in front of us.,237,,
1185,0.97,8434.225,8447.405,So there is absolutely a ton of appreciation that I want to express for the central staff who work on this and the team who had made themselves available during budget and is also quickly turning around to work on policy in front of us.,237,,
1186,0.97,8447.405,8453.044,So that all of us as Council members can have a deeper understanding of the legislation in front of us.,237,,
1187,0.97,8453.044,8456.481,Let's go ahead and go through the presentation here today.,237,,
1188,0.97,8456.481,8463.288,And we also do have a number of questions that I think folks have begun to surface.,237,,
1189,0.97,8463.288,8465.123,I will have some questions as well.,237,,
1190,0.97,8465.123,8470.528,"Council members, I want you to know who do have questions so I'm going to ask this of folks.",237,,
1191,0.97,8470.528,8477.902,Let's let Karina go through the entire presentation and we will go ahead and have each Council member have a chance to ask their questions.,237,,
1192,0.97,8477.902,8484.108,If we can get through the presentation that will give us a chance to have a more robust discussion about the bill as a whole.,237,,
1193,0.97,8484.108,8490.014,"Council members, thank you so much.",237,,
1194,0.97,8490.014,8495.353,"Karina, I'm going to turn it to you.",237,,
1195,0.97,8495.353,8496.187,Thank you.,238,,
1196,0.97,8496.187,8506.531,I have been waiting to share my screen until I was the one making the presentation.,238,,
1197,0.97,8506.531,8507.465,So I will share it now.,238,,
1198,0.97,8507.465,8509.534,Thank you so much for being here.,239,,
1199,0.97,8509.534,8510.301,Here it is.,240,,
1200,0.97,8510.301,8516.307,I will begin with a brief overview of the legislation itself.,240,,
1201,0.97,8516.307,8537.962,And then dive into some issue identification and I'll try to keep that summary quick as I understand that you do have a lot of questions and perhaps with the more detail I would typically share in a presentation can wait until I'm responding to individual Council member questions.,240,,
1202,0.97,8537.962,8538.263,Thank you.,240,,
1203,0.97,8538.263,8548.339,"So to begin this legislation, would, at its heart, require employers to reimburse construction employees for the cost of parking expenses to the work in Seattle.",241,,
1204,0.97,8548.339,8554.779,"So, what that translates into is the out of pocket expenses to park at or near construction sites in Seattle.",241,,
1205,0.97,8554.779,8573.298,"It would be enforced by the office of the labor standards, including the permanent and the temporary ordinances, I believe this would make it the 18th labor standard enforced by the office of labor standards.",241,,
1206,0.97,8573.298,8580.538,The definitions for construction work and construction employee and employer are here for you to take a look at.,241,,
1207,0.97,8580.538,8586.044,The definition of construction work is quite broad intentionally.,241,,
1208,0.97,8586.044,8588.212,It was adapted from existing Seattle municipal coated.,241,,
1209,0.97,8588.212,8591.416,And you'll see there that it includes any site preparation.,241,,
1210,0.97,8591.416,8593.851,So it is quite broad.,241,,
1211,0.97,8593.851,8601.459,And the fact that it's lines with existing code seems like it would help for consistent application.,241,,
1212,0.97,8601.459,8608.933,Construction employee is any employee performing construction work that is not limited to those covered by minimum wage.,241,,
1213,0.97,8608.933,8614.505,It would be any employee overtime eligible and overtime exempt.,241,,
1214,0.97,8614.505,8622.28,The definition for construction employer uses a term employer primarily engaged in construction.,241,,
1215,0.97,8622.28,8626.05,That is taken from the code 23 primarily is there intentionally.,241,,
1216,0.97,8626.05,8655.647,"I imagine that it is something that if this legislation is passed the office of labor standards would clarify in rule making in addition to Aligning with the code 23 this famous standard word used in construction definitions across the industry, this, the inclusion of primarily would prevent a commercial employer who was hiring at a restaurant, hiring for construction to repair a water leak from being covered by there legislation.",241,,
1217,0.97,8655.647,8685.877,"So that said, if there is an intention for broader application of what constitutes a construction employer, then perhaps that word would be revised and taken away.",241,,
1218,0.97,8685.877,8694.218,Then employers could use that amount to offset the amount owed.,242,,
1219,0.97,8694.218,8714.439,"So for example if an employee requested reimbursement of $30 for one day and perhaps they were already earning $8 per hour of work that day, and at $1 an hour, then the employer could pay $22 for reimbursement because they had already paid part of that amount.",242,,
1220,0.97,8714.439,8715.139,There is an exception.,242,,
1221,0.97,8715.139,8725.216,"Employers may opt, may not be subject to the reimbursement requirement if they provide free parking.",242,,
1222,0.97,8725.216,8737.862,The exception was added at Council member's direction and the source of this idea comes from a community work force agreement between the city of Seattle and Seattle building constructions and trades.,242,,
1223,0.97,8737.862,8762.353,"It is a bit old, but it is from 2015 to 2017 that required employers to provide parking within a three block radius, and if that was not an option, if that was not available, then the employer would provide transportation from whatever distance the free parking was to the construction job site.",242,,
1224,0.97,8762.353,8779.537,I will add that the legislation requires employers to pay for the employees time from the free parking to the construction site if the employer is required to provide that transportation.,243,,
1225,0.97,8779.537,8791.916,"Other requirements in the legislation are consistent with other labor standards, and notice of rights, record keeping for three years, and retaliation would be prohibited.",243,,
1226,0.97,8791.916,8805.997,"Office of labor standards would investigate complaints or they could also initiate directed investigations without a complaint based on a tip or based on data that they have evaluated, indicating a violation.",243,,
1227,0.97,8805.997,8807.698,Employees could also file a lawsuit.,243,,
1228,0.97,8807.698,8809.967,"And if the employee prevailed, the court could award attorney fees and costs.",243,,
1229,0.97,9004.228,9021.712,Perhaps it driving two days a week whether than five are perhaps Carpool incentives where perhaps the driver of the Carpal could receive additional pay than just the reimbursement for more than one worker in the vehicle.,244,,
1230,0.97,9021.712,9048.406,"Next, consideration of the administrative costs to process these reimbursements . One might imagine that if there are suddenly hundreds of employers at a Worksite submitting individual requests for reimbursement, the employer could pay significant amounts of money to process those requests and maybe it could be spent on other things such as transit subsidies.",244,,
1231,0.97,9048.406,9060.551,There could be consideration that there could be an establishment of one rate of reimbursement across the city or perhaps specific rates for identified areas that might streamline the reverse but process.,244,,
1232,0.97,9060.551,9066.257,This is an issue that could be fully or partially addressed by Ols rules.,244,,
1233,0.97,9066.257,9098.756,"Some of the issues mentioned in the memo do not need to be addressed in the legislation but given their is right now at 30 day effective date, the office of labor standards would not have sufficient time to develop the rules before the law went into effect . been there would be a situation where the law could be in effect for six months or nine months or longer without employers or employees having sufficient guidance to know with our obligations are and what the rights are.",244,,
1234,0.97,9098.756,9104.462,"That's why mentioning so many of these things now if cancel has the intent and we know included in legislation, that is something to consider.",244,,
1235,0.97,9104.462,9108.032,Next is the employee's Trice parking.,244,,
1236,0.97,9108.032,9119.877,"The legislation Infers, but does not specifically state employers cannot restrict the employee's Teresa parking.",244,,
1237,0.97,9119.877,9129.019,"Is it Self-Serve, valet, location, a certain distance to the site, cost of parking.",244,,
1238,0.97,9129.019,9136.927,The Unequivocal statements that allows restrictions would provide priority . The Office of labor and standards could address this issue.,244,,
1239,0.97,9136.927,9155.646,The Council has an opinion or direction they would like to make sure is followed by employers that then it could be wise to include it in the legislation.,244,,
1240,0.97,9155.646,9159.083,Next is the employer position for Pre-Parking.,244,,
1241,0.97,9159.083,9172.73,That is related to the exception to the reimbursement requirement if the parking is more than three blocks from the construction site.,244,,
1242,0.97,9172.73,9174.198,The employer must also provide free transportation.,244,,
1243,0.97,9174.198,9176.767,The distance of three blocks.,244,,
1244,0.97,9176.767,9189.346,"Could be quantified in the legislation to make it easier for employees and employers to know what is intended, the office of labor and standards could clarify those rules.",244,,
1245,0.97,9189.346,9196.253,My research shows there are about four different sizes of blocks in the city of Seattle depending on where the block is.,244,,
1246,0.97,9196.253,9201.292,"Again, to streamline the reimbursement process.",244,,
1247,0.97,9201.292,9214.138,Identified here the proposed .21 miles which is the length of any given block in the city.,244,,
1248,0.97,9214.138,9229.186,"Also, something to consider, the distance from the free parking to the construction site could be increased to one half mile to align with the standard walk shed to transit options often used by planners.",244,,
1249,0.97,9229.186,9233.824,Understand that might be too long to walk for a worker that is carrying heavy tools.,244,,
1250,0.97,9233.824,9234.458,Something to considered.,244,,
1251,0.97,9234.458,9244.001,That is the standard amount of this is planners use went thinking about what is reasonable for a person to walk from transit to the destination.,244,,
1252,0.97,9244.001,9256.18,"For employer payment of travel time, the legislation does not specify whether travel time includes the wait time for the free transportation from the free parking.",244,,
1253,0.97,9256.18,9259.216,That is something we can interpret.,244,,
1254,0.97,9259.216,9271.395,It is something counsel way want to include whether it includes wait time.,244,,
1255,0.97,9271.395,9283.474,"Including wait time, if the transportation does not come on a regular basis, employees might be standing, waiting for a bus for a significant amount of time.",244,,
1256,0.97,9283.474,9284.274,That is not paid.,244,,
1257,0.97,9284.274,9285.309,That is something to consider.,244,,
1258,0.97,9285.309,9291.215,"On the Flipside, the employer could arrive at the bus stop a half hour earlier and be paid for time standing there.",244,,
1259,0.97,9291.215,9292.216,This is a complex issue.,244,,
1260,0.97,9292.216,9302.159,Something I'm just reaching for Council consideration.,244,,
1261,0.97,9302.159,9302.993,"Next, penalties and fines.",244,,
1262,0.97,9302.993,9306.83,Legislation was written in 2021 and reflects the 2021 rates of penalties and fines.,244,,
1263,0.97,9306.83,9309.867,It would go into effect in 2022.,244,,
1264,0.97,9309.867,9316.373,The use of penalties and fines have been adjusted to reflect the rate of 2022 inflation.,244,,
1265,0.97,9316.373,9320.844,That is something Ols does as a standard course of action.,244,,
1266,0.97,9320.844,9330.788,"If that is something Councilmembers would like to incorporate into an amendment or substitute bill, that would raise the penalties and fines not by too much.",244,,
1267,0.97,9330.788,9338.529,I believe they would find 556 dollars increase to $575.,244,,
1268,0.97,9338.529,9344.201,It would also align with many of the standards.,244,,
1269,0.97,9344.201,9345.002,"Lost, the effective date.",244,,
1270,0.97,9345.002,9351.775,Right now the legislation would provide the office of labor and standards with 30 days to prepare for implementation.,244,,
1271,0.97,9351.775,9358.215,"As you have seen, there a lot of issues to considered for role making.",244,,
1272,0.97,9358.215,9371.628,"There's also the standard parts of implementation creating and translating model notices, educational materials, updating the Website, informing the contract and community partners of legislation, providing direct outreach to employers.",244,,
1273,0.97,9371.628,9377.835,That could happen after the effective date 30 days after passing by Council.,244,,
1274,0.97,9377.835,9399.056,"However, to have consistent application and for employees and Employeesto have consistent understanding of what the legislation is, with requiring seeking to achieve, council may want to consider a later effective date of six months, nine months, or a year.",244,,
1275,0.97,9399.056,9400.657,There is no optimal or standard effective date.,244,,
1276,0.97,9400.657,9406.363,"If I had to pick one, I would guess it would be between nine months and a year.",244,,
1277,0.97,9406.363,9416.707,"The next steps if this is voted out of committee, it could possibly be up for Council vote on December 13th.",244,,
1278,0.97,9416.707,9421.578,"If not, it could be considered by the next committee with labor standards by next year.",244,,
1279,0.97,9421.578,9423.847,That is all for my presentation.,244,,
1280,0.97,9423.847,9435.826,I will leave up my screen in case are questions related to a particular slide . I can also take it down so we can fully see everyone's face on the screen.,244,,
1281,0.97,9435.826,9440.597,"It is your preference, of course.",244,,
1282,0.97,9440.597,9441.698,"Thank you very much, Karina.",245,,
1283,0.97,9441.698,9450.641,I have the opportunity to view everybody screen by clicking on view and the titles that shows the Tic-Tac-Toe so you can see everyone's screen at the same time.,245,,
1284,0.97,9450.641,9456.947,We will keep your slides up in case Councilmembers want to talk back and forth.,245,,
1285,0.97,9456.947,9459.149,I want to thank you for the work you have done.,245,,
1286,0.97,9459.149,9462.286,The drafting on the legislation with swan's office.,245,,
1287,0.97,9462.286,9470.527,"Community, I want to thank you for the presentation in the memo.",245,,
1288,0.97,9470.527,9483.173,"At my request, I think the memo provides a helpful understanding of what is in the current legislation and identifies issues and areas for possible engagement with Councilmembers, especially as we think about how to make this actionable with the office of labor and standards.",245,,
1289,0.97,9483.173,9484.007,There is nothing inappropriate.,245,,
1290,0.97,9484.007,9490.047,There's nothing affairs about asking for a staff memo.,245,,
1291,0.97,9490.047,9494.918,Management's job outlining the issues included in the legislation so we can have a robust discussion is always.,245,,
1292,0.97,9494.918,9503.393,We appreciate your work . I wanted to ask a few questions about and Gabriel engagement with the office of labor and standards.,245,,
1293,0.97,9503.393,9541.632,"Very briefly, office of labor standards you mention the implementation Timeline and how some of these items could be worked out . through Rulemaking, as we have done before, where more in community engagement helps to refine the final policy of the office . has office of labor standards been able to engage with the sponsor or central staff as to the draft of the legislation in front of us what is this something the office of labor standards had the opportunity to Opine on or weigh in on or are these items, was this drafted with any input from well-off?",245,,
1294,0.97,9541.632,9549.373,Ols input happened after the legislation was written.,246,,
1295,0.97,9549.373,9556.446,I will turn it to Councilmember Herbold and I will have questions after that.,247,,
1296,0.97,9556.446,9558.015,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",247,,
1297,0.97,9558.015,9560.951,Thank you.,248,,
1298,0.97,9560.951,9579.836,"Questions, also, along the Stakeholder piece . Just interested to know, what the engagement has been done with employers of construction workers.",248,,
1299,0.97,9579.836,9584.141,"I know these types of policy engagements can be very, very challenging.",248,,
1300,0.97,9584.141,9593.617,"Has I think everybody on the Council knows, I have been working on legislation that creates minimum payment standards.",248,,
1301,0.97,9593.617,9600.357,For App-Based food delivery workers.,248,,
1302,0.97,9600.357,9609.6,That effort has been benefited by the presence participation of Councilmember Swant and Lewis.,248,,
1303,0.97,9609.6,9616.406,My office has held 20 Stakeholder meetings and lost four or five months.,248,,
1304,0.97,9616.406,9626.984,"So far, including conversations that include both the workers and the App-Based employers.",248,,
1305,0.97,9626.984,9633.056,And we have just been work shopping the ideas around minimum compensation.,248,,
1306,0.97,9633.056,9645.469,"Not in a way that does not always guarantee 100% alignment, but it definitely allows us to say we are doing that engagement.",248,,
1307,0.97,9645.469,9662.285,"I'm just interested to know, what has happened as far as work shopping some of these ideas with employers, whether or not the FEMA bill.",248,,
1308,0.97,9662.285,9700.123,The specific question I have around the expectation the employer would pay for travel time from the parking lot . I understand that this drives from the--sort of underlying labor agreements that the city has with contractors on our city projects . But I don't really understand the policy objective it serves.,248,,
1309,0.97,9700.123,9719.009,"As it relates specifically to why we would compensate folks for that time . You know, if somebody is for instance taking a bus to work, we don't pay them for the time it takes to get from the bus stop to the place of employment.",248,,
1310,0.97,9719.009,9724.414,"Again, I understand the idea of we went to compensate somebody for a work expense.",248,,
1311,0.97,9724.414,9739.496,"But, getting from their vehicle to the Jobsite or from the bus stop to the Jobsite seems to go above and beyond what a work expense should be.",248,,
1312,0.97,9739.496,9741.798,I would like to understand the thinking behind that.,248,,
1313,0.97,9741.798,9747.437,Councilmember Herbold thank you for your questions.,249,,
1314,0.97,9747.437,9757.547,"The majority of your questions are best directed towards the sponsor, Councilmember Swant.",249,,
1315,0.97,9757.547,9771.394,Paying workers for their travel time the agreement with that more than three block parking shuttle is that the parking could be quite far away.,249,,
1316,0.97,9771.394,9786.443,"The idea was the parking that the employer was providing, that would enable the workers to bring their tools, if it is so far away, the employer would be responsible for paying for the time to travel from Faraway parking to the Worksite.",249,,
1317,0.97,9786.443,9790.247,1019 I believe your best positioned these two questions.,249,,
1318,0.97,9790.247,9807.964,Any additional context for the intent behind the shuttle Flexion and the Stakeholder engagement questions Nays started with?,250,,
1319,0.97,9807.964,9808.398,Yes.,251,,
1320,0.97,9808.398,9809.399,I do want to respond.,251,,
1321,0.97,9809.399,9812.836,Also have my own points and questions.,251,,
1322,0.97,9812.836,9816.339,I will put you in the Queue after this if you would like to address.,252,,
1323,0.97,9816.339,9821.178,I can just wait and if you have more questions I can speak after that.,253,,
1324,0.97,9821.178,9829.853,"I'm not seeing any additional hands, Councilmember, if you want to go ahead, you can continue with your questions as well.",254,,
1325,0.97,9829.853,9838.428,"Rate . So first of all, thank you for working with the office and drafting the legislation.",255,,
1326,0.97,9838.428,9849.606,"Since we have delayed acting on the bill, I agree with the points you brought up updating it to 2022.",255,,
1327,0.97,9849.606,9850.974,That obviously makes sense.,255,,
1328,0.97,9850.974,9854.477,I'm not sure whether the bill will get voted on today or not.,255,,
1329,0.97,9854.477,9858.114,We're looking at 2022 anyway.,255,,
1330,0.97,9858.114,9861.585,I wanted to get that out of the way.,255,,
1331,0.97,9861.585,9868.859,Jan to struck by the timing and concerns with the employers.,255,,
1332,0.97,9868.859,9879.469,Small business we are talking about . The contract players have a lot of power in Seattle.,255,,
1333,0.97,9879.469,9888.411,"They make a lot of money . As far as work shopping with them, as was suggested, we know where they stand.",255,,
1334,0.97,9888.411,9890.28,We know from the Collective- bargaining results were they stand.,255,,
1335,0.97,9890.28,9898.755,They have not agreed to pay parking in many of the contracting associations.,255,,
1336,0.97,9898.755,9902.225,"Some of the workers have access to the project and labor agreements, but many don't.",255,,
1337,0.97,9902.225,9904.06,It is clear where they stand.,255,,
1338,0.97,9904.06,9913.37,"They agree only when first . and they are not forced to agree to it, they will force workers to go on strike to fight for paid parking.",255,,
1339,0.97,9913.37,9919.476,"To be clear, the Idf paid parking for construction workers is not an idea I made at.",255,,
1340,0.97,9919.476,9925.582,It clearly came from being one of the most prominent demands in the carpenter strike.,255,,
1341,0.97,9925.582,9944.267,"After having talked to literally I'm not exaggerating, hundreds of workers after many days . I could tell it was not just the demand from the carpenter strike . It was a demand that was widespread among construction workers.",255,,
1342,0.97,9944.267,9946.503,This bill represents the interest of those workers.,255,,
1343,0.97,9946.503,9982.238,"As far as the question about paying for time . again, those also, that also has come from--it has obviously come from the overwhelming feedback we have gotten my office gotten in my staff and I. we spent many hours and days with the construction workers during the strike, from what they have been saying, from what their weirs years of experience has been, and also from the point the project labor agreements have high standards.",255,,
1344,0.97,9982.238,9986.509,We want to have high standards in this kind of legislation as well.,255,,
1345,0.97,9986.509,9994.651,"Just to give an example, the iron workers, for example, the South towers, they travel to the central parking lot.",255,,
1346,0.97,9994.651,10003.56,Then they might into company Trop and from that point on the on the clock.,255,,
1347,0.97,10003.56,10009.199,It is related to the prevailing idea Ofhigh standards to the benefit of workers.,255,,
1348,0.97,10009.199,10014.204,"Again, that did not just come randomly.",255,,
1349,0.97,10014.204,10015.672,It came from all of that background.,255,,
1350,0.97,10015.672,10020.844,"I'm also a little or I am troubled him a not a little, quite troubled.",255,,
1351,0.97,10020.844,10028.118,"I understand this memo, prevailing memos is a normal course of events.",255,,
1352,0.97,10028.118,10030.387,That's not what is debate here.,255,,
1353,0.97,10030.387,10043.333,"It is the fact that the bulk of the memo and the presentation, has been about all the concerns . of course, we should have a full discussion.",255,,
1354,0.97,10043.333,10044.401,I'm not worried.,255,,
1355,0.97,10044.401,10045.001,We have responses.,255,,
1356,0.97,10045.001,10050.106,We did not bring this legislation willy-nilly.,255,,
1357,0.97,10050.106,10053.676,It came from a very thorough ongoing conversation with workers.,255,,
1358,0.97,10053.676,10057.58,I'm 100% confident this is the right thing to do.,255,,
1359,0.97,10057.58,10060.116,I'm not worried about responding to concerns.,255,,
1360,0.97,10060.116,10070.193,"I am troubled by the fact that almost no time has been spent, and the memo or presentation, on how the legislation would benefit the workers.",255,,
1361,0.97,10070.193,10072.729,That is the whole point of why we brought the legislation forward.,255,,
1362,0.97,10072.729,10074.597,How does it benefit workers?,255,,
1363,0.97,10074.597,10078.535,"And Karina, you mentioned research.",255,,
1364,0.97,10078.535,10083.006,Some research we would like to do . We have not reported.,255,,
1365,0.97,10083.006,10090.346,How much have central staff looked into how much more spending money put go into worker's pockets?,255,,
1366,0.97,10090.346,10092.749,"Workers are saying, they are getting fleeced.",255,,
1367,0.97,10092.749,10097.02,They are spending so much money paying for parking.,255,,
1368,0.97,10097.02,10102.725,Exactly what they get is less than what they make on paper.,255,,
1369,0.97,10102.725,10108.231,"So one question is, did we do analysis of the benefits to workers and communities?",255,,
1370,0.97,10108.231,10113.47,What is the impact on Undocumented construction workers are facing wage theft and other problems?,255,,
1371,0.97,10113.47,10119.576,What is the impact on workers attempting to pay for housing in Seattle? they didn't have to pay for parking.,255,,
1372,0.97,10119.576,10124.647,I don't claim tabs the typical evidence.,255,,
1373,0.97,10124.647,10124.948,Yes.,255,,
1374,0.97,10124.948,10125.882,What I have is anecdotal.,255,,
1375,0.97,10125.882,10129.385,It's overwhelming at Journal evidence.,255,,
1376,0.97,10129.385,10138.061,Workers will tell you anywhere from $4000- $7000 per year.,255,,
1377,0.97,10138.061,10139.095,That's a lot of money.,255,,
1378,0.97,10139.095,10144.534,How many millions of dollars we save our Hard-Working construction workers.,255,,
1379,0.97,10144.534,10145.468,That's one point about research.,255,,
1380,0.97,10145.468,10148.605,It would be useful to have that.,255,,
1381,0.97,10148.605,10154.11,It will make an overwhelming case for why this bill is necessary.,255,,
1382,0.97,10154.11,10160.016,"Also, as far as Stakeholders are concerned, it's unfortunate you didn't talk to my office.",255,,
1383,0.97,10160.016,10162.452,We have a lot of Stakeholder information.,255,,
1384,0.97,10162.452,10165.288,Literally hundreds of workers they will tell you what the problems are.,255,,
1385,0.97,10165.288,10168.925,Two other points.,255,,
1386,0.97,10168.925,10170.393,These are extremely important in my view.,255,,
1387,0.97,10170.393,10174.764,One is the memo makes a point about environmental impact.,255,,
1388,0.97,10174.764,10187.41,"But, specifically on the question of whether this legislation will cause construction workers to Incentivize them to drive even if they do not need to.",255,,
1389,0.97,10187.41,10191.881,"Karina, he said one might imagine that might happen.",255,,
1390,0.97,10191.881,10192.715,What is the evidence?,255,,
1391,0.97,10192.715,10196.953,This is supposed to be a technical memo based on data.,255,,
1392,0.97,10196.953,10199.422,Where is the evidence to show that?,255,,
1393,0.97,10199.422,10203.459,I don't have statistical evidence either.,255,,
1394,0.97,10203.459,10205.628,But I do have a huge amount of anecdotal evidence.,255,,
1395,0.97,10205.628,10220.91,"It is very clear to me, for having talked to hundreds of workers, that it is structural issues that require them to drive, including having to transport hundreds of pounds of tools and equipment, as the workers reminded us in public comment.",255,,
1396,0.97,10220.91,10230.486,"All the data indicate what's at stake is not that the construction work, the workers are forced to drive, because they are.",255,,
1397,0.97,10230.486,10233.323,"The question is, who will pay for it?",255,,
1398,0.97,10233.323,10249.906,"In the memo it says for establishing the right to pay parking for Incentivizing more construction workers to drive to work including those that don't need to carry heavy tools or travel long distances and who might otherwise use public transportation . "".",255,,
1399,0.97,10249.906,10252.642,There are structural reasons why construction workers drive.,255,,
1400,0.97,10252.642,10256.079,Those are beyond whether they cover carry heavy equipment.,255,,
1401,0.97,10256.079,10263.786,"In my conversations, I have not met one construction worker who said they do not have to carry tools.",255,,
1402,0.97,10263.786,10264.821,I am sure there are.,255,,
1403,0.97,10264.821,10267.056,I do not claim to be an expert.,255,,
1404,0.97,10267.056,10271.394,"My point is that, the need to carry tools is overwhelmingly true.",255,,
1405,0.97,10271.394,10281.871,I would say we should be looking not at Outliers but what the normal is.,255,,
1406,0.97,10281.871,10283.573,"In addition to that, there other structural reasons.",255,,
1407,0.97,10283.573,10293.049,"The reality is, many construction workers face lung communities from neighboring cities because they cannot afford to live in Seattle pick especially when they have families with children, it's almost not an option.",255,,
1408,0.97,10293.049,10297.32,"Most of them have to get to work early, before most of us are awake.",255,,
1409,0.97,10297.32,10305.228,They are at the Jobsite.,255,,
1410,0.97,10305.228,10307.063,They cannot find available transportation routes at that time.,255,,
1411,0.97,10307.063,10312.802,"In addition to all of this structural information, I will add another point which goes to the heart of what is Ms. raised in the memo.",255,,
1412,0.97,10312.802,10321.678,"Maybe, maybe construction workers will be Incentivized to drive.",255,,
1413,0.97,10321.678,10331.387,"The overall data, in King County over the last decade, overwhelmingly shows working people are highly informed about climate change and have been Proactive choosing public transportation even when it inconveniences them.",255,,
1414,0.97,10331.387,10333.456,Ridership has gone up and not down.,255,,
1415,0.97,10333.456,10342.598,During the same time funding for public transportation has failed to keep up with population increases in the skill of the climate crisis.,255,,
1416,0.97,10342.598,10346.469,So I mean I'm not contributing indeed dent whatsoever.,255,,
1417,0.97,10346.469,10356.479,I don't think from a data standpoint come a it is responsible to raise questions when there's no indication in the data to suggest this happens.,255,,
1418,0.97,10356.479,10360.083,"At the very least, those Clarifications need to be made.",255,,
1419,0.97,10360.083,10365.955,"The other point I have, which is extremely important is, there are issues raised in the memo.",255,,
1420,0.97,10365.955,10372.462,"These are problematic, extremely and perhaps even more than the parking stuff.",255,,
1421,0.97,10372.462,10380.37,"The memo says, quote, the positive outcome for some construction workers is juxtaposed.",255,,
1422,0.97,10380.37,10397.053,Legislation would provide a benefit for category of workers that comprises 7% of the Seattle area's workforce that earned an average of $27.11 per hour with specialties earning more than $50 per hour.,255,,
1423,0.97,10397.053,10403.326,Low-wage workers in other industries have the minimum wage per hour.,255,,
1424,0.97,10403.326,10411.467,Workers of color may need to drive long distances to work due to a lack of affordable housing in Seattle . that is true.,255,,
1425,0.97,10411.467,10417.974,There are other workers who won't immediately get it if this legislation passes.,255,,
1426,0.97,10417.974,10425.481,"Just for starters, if this bill became law, it would help Union and Non-Represented construction workers.",255,,
1427,0.97,10425.481,10432.422,Denote Nonunion construction workers are Disproportionally from marginalized communities and low income backgrounds.,255,,
1428,0.97,10432.422,10437.86,Many of the Nonunion workers and workers of color experience widespread wage gap.,255,,
1429,0.97,10437.86,10456.212,"Let's be clear, it would benefit construction workers across the board and Disproportionally benefit workers who are facing other areas the the biggest problem with including this in the technical memo, essentially it's a race to the bottom argument . It is a political position.",255,,
1430,0.97,10456.212,10467.323,"It's a race to the bottom type of argument because essentially it says the reason, potentially--under the memo is not taking a position specifically and it has to be taken by elected officials.",255,,
1431,0.97,10467.323,10481.337,"I am just saying, by raising that point essentially it is saying, potentially to not give paid parking to construction workers is that other workers make lower wages than them.",255,,
1432,0.97,10481.337,10483.372,So the solution is not to drag everyone down.,255,,
1433,0.97,10483.372,10489.278,The solution is for workers to win.,255,,
1434,0.97,10489.278,10501.39,A race to the bottom argument have been made against every single movement to make an improvement in the living standards of any section of the working class implying the game to some workers come at the expense of other workers.,255,,
1435,0.97,10501.39,10503.392,This is dividing language.,255,,
1436,0.97,10503.392,10506.529,Councilmember Swant?,256,,
1437,0.97,10506.529,10512.001,Councilmember Swant you mention you are not trying to assign motives.,256,,
1438,0.97,10512.001,10515.471,Please refrain from this.,256,,
1439,0.97,10515.471,10516.239,I now.,257,,
1440,0.97,10516.239,10520.343,I have to call out the reality of it this is.,257,,
1441,0.97,10520.343,10528.217,The labor movement shows the gains won by any section of the working class results and benefits as a whole.,257,,
1442,0.97,10528.217,10535.157,It is why this legislation has the support of workers broadly.,257,,
1443,0.97,10535.157,10535.992,Not just construction workers.,257,,
1444,0.97,10535.992,10543.699,"Many workers are saying, first of all, out of solidarity, I went construction workers to have it.",257,,
1445,0.97,10543.699,10550.006,"On top of that, workers understand if construction workers get it, it will help workers as a whole.",257,,
1446,0.97,10550.006,10556.546,"Not to get paid parking specifically, but the improvement in living standards is good for everybody, no matter which section of workers get it.",257,,
1447,0.97,10556.546,10563.419,We should keep in mind parking is paid by contractor bosses who make massive profits.,257,,
1448,0.97,10563.419,10571.027,"I would really urge everyone is going to vote, today or later, I'm not a member of the committee.",257,,
1449,0.97,10571.027,10576.799,"I just want to clarify two workers watching this, I would not be able to vote on this.",257,,
1450,0.97,10576.799,10579.168,Members of the committee will meet at some point.,257,,
1451,0.97,10579.168,10586.042,"I would urge Councilmembers to look at this, not from the divided standpoint but from what the history shows.",257,,
1452,0.97,10586.042,10591.847,"Actually any section of workers, helps all workers.",257,,
1453,0.97,10591.847,10606.662,"Furthermore, the only way to improve the situation with carbon emissions through vehicular omission which you are right, vehicular emissions and building admissions are the two main culprits we address.",257,,
1454,0.97,10606.662,10610.933,The only way to address it is not to not provide paid parking two workers.,257,,
1455,0.97,10610.933,10612.969,Because they will drive for the like it or not.,257,,
1456,0.97,10612.969,10615.604,"The question is, because they need to drive.",257,,
1457,0.97,10615.604,10620.676,The question is who pays for it.,257,,
1458,0.97,10620.676,10632.054,"The only way to address the vehicular omission is to fight to expand funding for public transit and expand routes, density, and frequency of routes.",257,,
1459,0.97,10632.054,10633.289,That's what we need to do.,257,,
1460,0.97,10633.289,10634.323,Thank you so much.,258,,
1461,0.97,10634.323,10645.468,I'm going to make comments and 1014 if you have any last questions and then I think Councilmembers what provided a good summary.,258,,
1462,0.97,10645.468,10656.245,"I want to make sure . for me number one, again I appreciate the work that has gone into this central staff presentation.",258,,
1463,0.97,10656.245,10663.753,"It is absolutely appropriate to identify various issues that intersect with legislation, no matter what the legislation is in front of us.",258,,
1464,0.97,10663.753,10677.767,Councilmember Swant on here you'd like to add additional information about how the additional dollars in worker pockets is not going to park it will go to impact workers or the local economy.,258,,
1465,0.97,10677.767,10679.802,I think that is a fair thing to ask for.,258,,
1466,0.97,10679.802,10689.345,It's also up to Councilmembers to flag the things they see as the benefits of the legislation in front of us.,258,,
1467,0.97,10689.345,10690.646,I appreciate you have done that.,258,,
1468,0.97,10690.646,10695.051,Is fair to ask about including additional items in central staff memos.,258,,
1469,0.97,10695.051,10708.03,That's what it's for to identify issues that are possibly going to have questions when it relates to implementation . and the entire purpose of passing legislation is to ensure there is an impact.,258,,
1470,0.97,10708.03,10712.101,"If there are issues standing in the way of that, we went the slide early.",258,,
1471,0.97,10712.101,10731.787,"For me I think there's a number of questions I would like the sponsor to be able to go over with Council and have some possible amendments for consideration . When this legislation is voted on, I think you have raised a number of items here today . and one of those Councilmember Swant you have agreed with the need to update the 2022 adjustments.",258,,
1472,0.97,10731.787,10736.692,Thank you for noting the importance of including that in the memo and from the sponsor.,258,,
1473,0.97,10736.692,10742.565,That something I think would be to reflect as well.,258,,
1474,0.97,10742.565,10746.202,"I also want to note, my interest in looking at additional support for on-site stories.",258,,
1475,0.97,10746.202,10761.45,I too was at the strike line and have talked to construction workers about how a number of folks do have to carry tools day in and day out.,258,,
1476,0.97,10761.45,10768.557,There's a lot of concern about that for on-site storage and how we can make sure on-site storage is something employers are offering ended secure.,258,,
1477,0.97,10768.557,10771.193,Recognizing the workers themselves are often responsible for the costs of those tools.,258,,
1478,0.97,10771.193,10779.435,We want to make sure there's more on-site storage if there is a chance to leave tools On- site.,258,,
1479,0.97,10779.435,10783.806,"On administrative costs, I'm interested in identifying if there is additional strategies their metric offer a Win-Win.",258,,
1480,0.97,10783.806,10788.077,Getting to when this is easier to apply and implement . We know the workers benefit.,258,,
1481,0.97,10788.077,10801.457,"On some of the preferences around administrative costs, I think it's interesting to see how we can make sure we are streaming, streamlining the implementation effort here.",258,,
1482,0.97,10801.457,10809.131,"When I look at Rulemaking, the short Timeline identified for implementation that is Defaulting to us needing to put more information into the statute.",258,,
1483,0.97,10809.131,10828.217,Perhaps there is a benefit of having not being too prescriptive and having some about left to Ols for implementation if that September deadline helps to allow for some Rulemaking on some items.,258,,
1484,0.97,10828.217,10830.92,You may want to be more flexible based on what Rulemaking comes up with.,258,,
1485,0.97,10830.92,10835.291,I would be interesting in hearing more from Stakeholders and Ols about what items would be most appropriate for Rulemaking.,258,,
1486,0.97,10835.291,10838.06,"If that man's a September deadline, I'd be interesting in hearing more about that.",258,,
1487,0.97,10838.06,10845.167,"If it means keeping the deadline and be more prescriptive in statute, I be interested in both options.",258,,
1488,0.97,10845.167,10860.783,Regarding the difference in the mileage to walk I appreciate the work that went into that expectation for .2 1R .5 of a distance we are talking about in terms of walk ability to construction site.,258,,
1489,0.97,10860.783,10868.657,One of the areas we have looked at in the past has been the 10 minute walk the Federal Department recommends.,258,,
1490,0.97,10868.657,10876.232,We think there is some work potentially there we could pull in from some of the best practices for Accessing transit.,258,,
1491,0.97,10876.232,10880.936,We talk about a 10 minute walk said often.,258,,
1492,0.97,10880.936,10885.174,I wonder if there's interest in and using the 10 minute walk said radius versus specific blocks?,258,,
1493,0.97,10885.174,10897.052,If there's additional work the sponsor would be interested in sort of defining accessibility by how far the individual has to work versus the link of the block.,258,,
1494,0.97,10897.052,10915.437,"Perhaps as part of the analysis that has already been done . If the 10 minute walk shed is something that is of interest, I'd be interested in working with the sponsor on that as well . Since that is a reliable alternative we have been looking at when it relates to transit services.",258,,
1495,0.97,10915.437,10919.441,"Maybe if that is seen is not accessible enough, we can further refine that.",258,,
1496,0.97,10919.441,10927.383,"Lastly, I am interested in this question of the equity analysis.",258,,
1497,0.97,10927.383,10935.524,"I think the point we need to continue to be working on, making sure transit is more accessible.",258,,
1498,0.97,10935.524,10940.596,Tends it options are more accessible to all workers especially low-wage workers.,258,,
1499,0.97,10940.596,10942.164,We look at equity impacts.,258,,
1500,0.97,10942.164,10953.008,It's important . We talked about how we can increase exit access to transit in various industries who have the need to get in and out of the workplace at alternative times.,258,,
1501,0.97,10953.008,10965.387,"You know, working late or morning shifts . that applies to many different sectors a including Childcare, retail, domestic worker and restaurant industry.",258,,
1502,0.97,10965.387,10975.531,"The point is well taken about how do we make sure we are increasing access to transit at all times, for all different sectors.",258,,
1503,0.97,10975.531,10995.851,I get there is a specific nexus here with the wait construction workers are carrying when it relates to tools and the importance of them being there on time with tools in hand.,258,,
1504,0.97,10995.851,11000.522,"It gives me a lot of indication that we have some work to do, for not just parking on-site, but also storage on-site.",258,,
1505,0.97,11000.522,11023.645,"Lastly, I did not know where the spit in book when I was talking to some workers about the parking desire, desired in this legislation, some of the Union members I spoke to were talking about how we can work with developers who often create the parking . and then they built the building around it . If there's parking being developed, is there a safe way to ensure access to parking On- site for buildings being created?",258,,
1506,0.97,11023.645,11040.562,"And/or adjacent buildings that have recently been built, so more workers can access those buildings that have been constructed by similar developers works and thus, make sure that parking come of it is being developed on-site or near the site, is accessed first?",258,,
1507,0.97,11040.562,11045.401,Those are some of the issues I'd be interested in working with the sponsor on.,258,,
1508,0.97,11045.401,11052.608,It does sound like we need another meeting on this to address some of those amendments.,258,,
1509,0.97,11052.608,11053.942,Unless I hear otherwise from folks today.,258,,
1510,0.97,11053.942,11062.684,"Not hearing otherwise, Councilmember Swant had be happy to work with you on the items you addressed in some of the questions I brought up as well.",258,,
1511,0.97,11062.684,11065.12,Councilmember Herbold did you have anything else?,258,,
1512,0.97,11065.12,11068.557,I was just looking to find out your process plans.,259,,
1513,0.97,11068.557,11070.592,Thank you for asking.,260,,
1514,0.97,11070.592,11075.297,Given the short month we have for cancel recess.,260,,
1515,0.97,11075.297,11076.298,I'm looking at the candle.,260,,
1516,0.97,11076.298,11087.81,"Councilmember Swant I'm thinking if amendments are due to central staff Monday, close of business next week, Monday the 13th, I give us one full week before the holiday recess.",260,,
1517,0.97,11087.81,11095.984,Then we would have those amendments into central staff hands.,260,,
1518,0.97,11095.984,11097.619,Obviously the week we come back as well.,260,,
1519,0.97,11097.619,11108.397,"I would suggest, amendments due the end of the day on Monday December 13th.",260,,
1520,0.97,11108.397,11109.198,On not hearing concerns.,260,,
1521,0.97,11109.198,11121.376,"But we will do Monday, December 13th, Karina, I hope if you have any concerns about the Timeline as well, please do Chime in.",260,,
1522,0.97,11121.376,11124.379,Because this all revolves around your ability to work with Councilmembers on possible ideas.,260,,
1523,0.97,11124.379,11124.847,That works.,261,,
1524,0.97,11124.847,11125.247,Thank you.,261,,
1525,0.97,11125.247,11127.883,"Excellent with that, colleagues thank you for the robust discussion today.",262,,
1526,0.97,11127.883,11136.825,Is there any additional comments or questions on this item quote Dissemble 13.,262,,
1527,0.97,11136.825,11137.426,Ahead Councilmember Swant.,262,,
1528,0.97,11137.426,11138.06,Thank you.,263,,
1529,0.97,11138.06,11144.366,I wanted to respond to some of the points and make some I'm sorry we are closing discussions.,263,,
1530,0.97,11144.366,11167.289,"I just wanted to make some closing statements as well . on the issue, Yeah, I didn't know this memo was being prepared so I did not have a chance to provide any feedback before yesterday.",263,,
1531,0.97,11167.289,11170.025,I only had the ability to look at it last night.,263,,
1532,0.97,11170.025,11174.596,Karina brought it earlier.,263,,
1533,0.97,11174.596,11176.431,"I know my staff member, it starts with Karina.",263,,
1534,0.97,11176.431,11182.538,As soon as he was able this morning.,263,,
1535,0.97,11182.538,11183.972,We will continue that conversation absolutely.,263,,
1536,0.97,11183.972,11198.587,"Specifically, Karina, we would want to follow up with you on the research questions I raised about how the different ways the spectrum of benefits, ways in which this bill would benefit workers.",263,,
1537,0.97,11198.587,11203.058,If we can can include some data on that.,263,,
1538,0.97,11203.058,11216.738,"At the very least, I would urge workers, who have told us and as I have said, dozens of those, should be contacted . so they will tell you their real life experience.",263,,
1539,0.97,11216.738,11221.543,"If you include some information on this, that I think that should be a very important part of the equation.",263,,
1540,0.97,11221.543,11230.852,On the point about leaving things to Rulemaking and not being too prescriptive.,263,,
1541,0.97,11230.852,11231.486,I completely agree.,263,,
1542,0.97,11231.486,11240.896,"As a matter of fact, my understanding of the bill we have drafted is that, I'm happy to continue conversations.",263,,
1543,0.97,11240.896,11242.264,That is how we drafted the bill.,263,,
1544,0.97,11242.264,11256.478,That is my understanding of how the approach we have used as being based to make sure that we don't give too many unnecessary details and we leave it to Rulemaking.,263,,
1545,0.97,11256.478,11259.314,Is not that we are not willing to be flexible.,263,,
1546,0.97,11259.314,11263.585,I think that is the approach we have used.,263,,
1547,0.97,11263.585,11270.359,"But we are happy to discuss with central staff and also your office, Councilmember Msqueda, to see what we can streamline over there.",263,,
1548,0.97,11270.359,11277.599,"And for example, the on-site parking options.",263,,
1549,0.97,11277.599,11279.001,Those things are built into the bill.,263,,
1550,0.97,11279.001,11280.936,I'm glad to hear some of the things mentioned.,263,,
1551,0.97,11280.936,11285.507,"As far as I can remember, those things are already included in the bill.",263,,
1552,0.97,11285.507,11291.546,But we can go back and check if there's anything not included to make sure we identify that as well in the bill.,263,,
1553,0.97,11291.546,11303.592,"Lastly, on the distance, the walking distance, the 10 minute walking time . We probably need to go back on that.",263,,
1554,0.97,11303.592,11307.029,We need to talk to workers as well.,263,,
1555,0.97,11307.029,11315.37,"We just thought it was easier to count the blocks rather than plant absolute distance in feet . But again, I'm happy to discuss that further.",263,,
1556,0.97,11315.37,11328.884,"My preference, obviously, would be that we build this bill as soon as possible without any sort of watering down with loopholes.",263,,
1557,0.97,11328.884,11337.926,"I'm okay if Councilmembers are inclined to support this, and we have a date of Monday for amendment . I'm fine with that.",263,,
1558,0.97,11337.926,11339.528,I would not be supporting watering down amendments.,263,,
1559,0.97,11339.528,11351.907,"Lastly, the point the memo RAISES about what Councilmembers have raised about what are the alternatives we can do to provide the same kind of support to the workers without actually providing paid parking?",263,,
1560,0.97,11351.907,11357.479,"I am completely open to discussing all kinds of things, including on-site storage.",263,,
1561,0.97,11357.479,11361.116,I think it would be good if workers had on-site storage.,263,,
1562,0.97,11361.116,11370.859,"But I'm not to be supporting is having these discussions, in the hypothetical, not putting the bill forward.",263,,
1563,0.97,11370.859,11372.461,This is a concrete step forward for workers.,263,,
1564,0.97,11372.461,11382.404,"If Councilmembers have an alternative, to not to say it would be nice to have on-site stored of that mandate something alternatively to alleviate the stress on workers, then we should look at that.",263,,
1565,0.97,11382.404,11397.119,I also would say on-site storage will not be entirely in any way a substitute for parking . We know that workers are driving along with curing their tools.,263,,
1566,0.97,11397.119,11400.088,It also they commute long distances.,263,,
1567,0.97,11400.088,11406.261,Let me go to Councilmember Strauss.,264,,
1568,0.97,11406.261,11406.962,I'm sorry.,265,,
1569,0.97,11406.962,11411.7,I did not mean to interrupt you Councilmember Swant.,265,,
1570,0.97,11411.7,11418.874,I'm 12 minutes overdue . If I left we would not have warm and that would've ended the conversation.,265,,
1571,0.97,11418.874,11425.08,I just wanted to raise my hand and say I have to leave.,265,,
1572,0.97,11425.08,11425.48,I'm sorry.,265,,
1573,0.97,11425.48,11425.881,Understood.,266,,
1574,0.97,11425.881,11427.082,Karina I saw your hand that.,266,,
1575,0.97,11427.082,11428.917,"Are we Okay, go ahead.",266,,
1576,0.97,11428.917,11442.03,"I just wanted to quickly say that when myself and other central staffers are drafting memos, that we are seeking to undermine legislation.",267,,
1577,0.97,11442.03,11452.641,"I just want to make it clear, the memo is not implying that the parking reimbursement should not be required for workers, but rather to consider ways to prevent or address consequences in providing paid parking.",267,,
1578,0.97,11452.641,11458.78,For example transit subsidies could possibly be provided in addition to parking reimbursements.,267,,
1579,0.97,11458.78,11471.159,"The memo did not seek to undermine, or say that the parking reimbursements should not happen or were a bad idea.",267,,
1580,0.97,11471.159,11473.829,I feel that's important to mention as it applies to any central staff.,267,,
1581,0.97,11473.829,11476.665,"Last, I was not able to check with Ols about staffing needs.",267,,
1582,0.97,11476.665,11481.736,It seems like there policy staff is at a tipping point.,267,,
1583,0.97,11481.736,11487.609,So that makes Rulemaking more difficult too took thank you.,267,,
1584,0.97,11487.609,11489.244,I just thought that was important to raise.,267,,
1585,0.97,11489.244,11490.312,It's important to raise.,268,,
1586,0.97,11490.312,11491.079,Thank you very much.,268,,
1587,0.97,11491.079,11492.848,It should go without saying Unfortunately.,268,,
1588,0.97,11492.848,11495.55,I'm glad you did say it again today.,268,,
1589,0.97,11495.55,11500.422,I want to make sure to reiterate that we all received the memo at the same time.,268,,
1590,0.97,11500.422,11504.259,It was appreciated took a lot of work went into it.,268,,
1591,0.97,11504.259,11509.598,Sponsors don't often get to review central stuff memos.,268,,
1592,0.97,11509.598,11514.836,These are generated for factual purposes.,268,,
1593,0.97,11514.836,11517.472,Is nothing out of the ordinary with this memo in front of us.,268,,
1594,0.97,11517.472,11519.441,I appreciate all the conversation that is happened today.,268,,
1595,0.97,11519.441,11522.811,"Councilmember Swant, I think the ball is in your court for responding to the concerns today.",268,,
1596,0.97,11522.811,11526.014,We look forward to hearing more about the amendments you may be ringing forward on Monday.,268,,
1597,0.97,11526.014,11532.32,"For central staff, this is your piece of legislation.",268,,
1598,0.97,11532.32,11544.065,You have heard some of the items from today's discussion.,268,,
1599,0.97,11544.566,11547.569,We will be looking to see what your office put forward in terms of amendments.,268,,
1600,0.97,11547.569,11549.471,"With that, we at the end of today's meeting.",268,,

1603,0.97,11553.642,11559.214,"Karina, you have Bennett many of these meetings throughout the year as it relates to labor standards.",268,,
1604,0.97,11559.214,11564.219,Let me thank you for all of your work and for everybody from central staff who has been providing us with updates throughout the year.,268,,
1605,0.97,11564.219,11566.221,"Not only on finance and housing, but also on budget.",268,,
1606,0.97,11566.221,11575.564,"It is midnight honor to serve as your Finance and housing chair and vice chair, and colleagues thank you for the long meetings we have had the lost two years.",268,,
1607,0.97,11575.564,11580.235,"With that, it will conclude my tenure currently in this term.",268,,
1608,0.97,11580.235,11595.884,I do hope to continue to work with all of you in 2022 on these issues as it relates to housing needs and a more sound and robust budget . I'm looking forward to that conversation in 2022.,268,,
