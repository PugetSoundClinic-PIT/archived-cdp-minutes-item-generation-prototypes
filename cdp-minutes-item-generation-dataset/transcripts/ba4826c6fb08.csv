78,0.97,411.511,413.713,That is just a quick overview of the general process.,20,,
79,0.97,413.713,415.281,Oir will lead us through the particulars.,20,,
80,0.97,415.281,418.418,This includes how we can engage with Oir.,20,,
81,0.97,418.418,419.418,They are hard at work.,20,,

83,0.97,424.09,429.762,Then I will hand it over to director Wilson to begin the presentation.,20,,
84,0.97,429.762,431.197,Good morning.,20,,
85,0.97,431.197,434.2,Good morning.,21,,

87,0.97,437.103,443.81,State relation's director.,22,,
88,0.97,443.81,454.821,I am the government relations program director.,23,,
89,0.97,454.821,456.789,I wanted to just start with a quick apology.,24,,
90,0.97,456.789,458.224,There is maintenance happening in my building.,24,,
91,0.97,458.224,463.463,"Any loud noises, I apologize for that in advance.",24,,
92,0.97,463.463,468.367,We are before you with an update on the upcoming legislative session as we work through the process of drafting your 2021 legislative agenda.,24,,
93,0.97,468.367,487.753,"I would like to thank many of you for taking the time to meet with us individually to review your specific legislative priorities for the upcoming session and for those of you who have not had the opportunity to hear from us yet, we will work to get something on the calendar very soon.",24,,
94,0.97,487.753,493.96,We will provide a little bit of the in-depth Timeline.,24,,
95,0.97,493.96,504.47,"Once we have incorporated feedback from you all from today and our individual meetings, we will be before you again with a draft of the legislative agenda.",24,,
96,0.97,504.47,507.807,The goal is to adopt that agenda before the holiday recess.,24,,
97,0.97,507.807,516.916,This upcoming session will be unlike any session in the history of this state.,24,,
98,0.97,516.916,523.055,The challenges posed by Covid- 19 are enormous given the volume of legislators.,24,,
99,0.97,523.055,540.039,I know you have all figured out meetings at the city level.,24,,
100,0.97,540.039,543.609,The legislator is still working through some profound challenges Logistically as it relates to this upcoming session.,24,,
101,0.97,543.609,545.745,Robin will speak a little bit to that in her report.,24,,
102,0.97,545.745,566.666,"This is in terms of how that will impact logistics, how you all engage and the volume of bills that they will move forward with this year.",24,,
103,0.97,566.666,568.067,"Most importantly, I would like to start.",24,,
104,0.97,568.067,569.936,We have a new state legislative advocacy team.,24,,
105,0.97,569.936,571.904,I wanted to start with an introduction starting with Robin.,24,,
106,0.97,571.904,574.573,Many of you know her from her time at the office of housing.,24,,
107,0.97,574.573,575.841,She became the relation's director last year.,24,,
108,0.97,575.841,581.48,Many thanks to Robin and Emily Alvarado at the office of housing for supporting our work when we are looking to fill the role in a short time.,24,,
109,0.97,581.48,584.216,Now Robin has moved into our deputy director role given Cheryl Schwab's departure.,24,,
110,0.97,584.216,586.986,Quinn has experience in the Washington state legislator and formally as the state lobbyist.,24,,
111,0.97,586.986,588.988,They have moved into the state relation director role.,24,,
112,0.97,588.988,594.894,They are a state advocate . a big welcome to Quinn.,24,,
113,0.97,594.894,596.095,Thank you to Quinn and Dr.,24,,
114,0.97,596.095,596.495,Zimbabwe.,24,,
115,0.97,596.495,607.707,We are glad to have Quinn heading up the state program at Oir.,24,,
116,0.97,607.707,613.179,"Last but not least, many of you have worked with Hannah Smith managing our Federal relations portfolio as the acting Federal relations director.",24,,
117,0.97,613.179,624.19,Now Hannah has graciously slipped it over to join the state lobby team as the government affairs program manager.,24,,
118,0.97,624.19,624.991,There have been many changes.,24,,
119,0.97,624.991,629.462,"That being said, you can Email any of us and we will make sure that we are managing the right portfolio.",24,,
120,0.97,629.462,635.735,Lastly I wanted to recognize this moment in history and the Council's commitment to center our work in racial justice.,24,,
121,0.97,635.735,657.49,We are appreciative of the time that members and legislative leaders in the black caucus and members of the other caucus as well as the Senator and representative have taken a significant amount of time this interim to work through issues in the criminal justice and police reform portfolio.,24,,
122,0.97,657.49,659.058,Robin will review this next.,24,,
123,0.97,659.058,661.961,Thank you.,24,,
124,0.97,661.961,662.762,"Good morning, everyone.",25,,
125,0.97,662.762,673.739,"First, I thought I would just take this opportunity to talk a little bit more about the general overview as Lily said.",25,,
126,0.97,673.739,677.41,I think it is going to be a very different legislative session that we have ever seen before.,25,,
127,0.97,677.41,679.578,"Hopefully, that will make it easier for members of Council to engage.",25,,
128,0.97,679.578,692.692,It will not be met necessary to go down to Olympia to testify or meet with legislators.,25,,
129,0.97,693.059,699.999,"I am hoping that we can help you facilitate meetings much more easily during this session, especially when there are quite a few things that we really want to see happen this legislative session.",25,,
130,0.97,699.999,703.169,Lawmakers have been signaling that they are going to be very focused.,25,,
131,0.97,703.169,706.338,There will be a few issues in this session that will be almost entirely virtual.,25,,
132,0.97,706.338,708.808,Those three areas of focus are the budget of course.,25,,
133,0.97,708.808,719.285,It is related to Covid-19.,25,,
134,0.97,724.557,726.125,This has cause havoc on the state budget.,25,,
135,0.97,726.125,728.427,You are grappling with the impacts of that on the local level.,25,,
136,0.97,728.427,729.895,The state has a similar situation.,25,,
137,0.97,729.895,731.23,Coronavirus relief will be another area of focus.,25,,
138,0.97,731.23,733.032,"Of course, as Lily mentioned, there is police reform.",25,,
139,0.97,733.032,735.801,Those three issues will be the things that will receive the most Airtime.,25,,
140,0.97,735.801,738.337,They will be the most likely to be able to advance this year.,25,,
141,0.97,738.337,750.583,"As far as the budget is concerned, the revenue forecast that came in a few weeks ago was better than expected and better than what was forecasted in June.",25,,
142,0.97,750.583,752.651,There was nearly a $9 billion shortfall projected through 2023.,25,,
143,0.97,752.651,758.023,Now that has been cut in half to only 4.2 billion.,25,,
144,0.97,758.023,761.393,"While that is a significant improvement, of course many things are quite tenuous with these budget forecasts.",25,,
145,0.97,761.393,768.367,Nobody is familiar with dealing with Covid-19 and a pandemic affecting the economy.,25,,
146,0.97,768.367,771.437,It is more optimistic but there are quite a few pressures on the budget.,25,,
147,0.97,771.437,776.675,The outcomes of the Federal elections will influence the potential stimulus funds received by the state.,25,,
148,0.97,776.675,781.113,It will impact the state budget.,25,,
149,0.97,781.113,782.782,Quinn will address progressive revenue later this morning.,25,,
150,0.97,782.782,790.689,"We do know that lawmakers have said in terms of revenue, nothing is off the table.",25,,
151,0.97,790.689,800.466,They are looking at a range of options to raise progressive revenue for the state.,25,,
152,0.97,800.466,803.702,"We understand that as far as the virtual session goes, the House will be fully remote.",25,,
153,0.97,803.702,806.472,The Senate will be a hybrid government and in person but mostly remote.,25,,
154,0.97,806.472,811.41,This slows the process down significantly.,25,,
155,0.97,811.41,815.781,Technological difficulties really present some issues.,25,,
156,0.97,815.781,832.798,"Also, staffing, obviously, many legislative staff can be in a room together or down at the capital.",25,,
157,0.97,833.666,834.4,That has some impact.,25,,
158,0.97,834.4,837.436,"During committee days in late September, there was only one hearing held at a time.",25,,
159,0.97,837.436,840.773,"Of course, this significantly reduces the number of things that can happen during a normal session.",25,,
160,0.97,840.773,852.651,"There is often four, five, six, 78 things going on at the same time.",25,,
161,0.97,852.651,855.321,I do not think they are entirely sure how everything is going to go.,25,,
162,0.97,855.321,860.759,I think we can just assume that the volume of what will happen is going to be much less than it would be in a normal year.,25,,
163,0.97,860.759,883.415,"We are also being told that each legislative, each lawmaker will only, they are not essentially saying that you can't only introduce a number of bills but they are saying that you should really focus on two or three different proposals that you want to see advance rather than the many many that lawmakers often introduced in a regular long session.",25,,
164,0.97,883.415,893.893,"We are also hearing that in order to proceed, unless it is in one these tab three areas of Coronavirus relief, budget, and police reform; there will be substantial agreement on proposals for them to move forward.",25,,
165,0.97,893.893,904.903,They are not going to want to waste a lot of time on the house or Senate floor to engage in controversial conversations in order to just get the normal business of the legislator done.,25,,
166,0.97,904.903,935.234,"So all of those things add up to you know, I think us as a city, we need to be focused on what our priorities are so that we can hope to get things advanced this legislative session.",25,,
167,0.97,935.234,937.937,"So if anybody else has any issues, I will pause for a moment.",25,,
168,0.97,937.937,940.639,"If you have questions about the procedure and lay of the land, please speak.",25,,
169,0.97,940.639,941.24,Any questions?,26,,
170,0.97,941.24,943.142,"It looks like there are not any Robin, proceed.",26,,
171,0.97,943.142,944.109,Thank you Council President.,27,,
172,0.97,944.109,948.681,I am going to move now to discussing police reform.,27,,
173,0.97,948.681,955.654,"I want everyone to know that of course, you know, in the process of the setting of the legislative agenda, we ask all of the departments and agencies to submit their legislative priorities to us.",27,,
174,0.97,955.654,963.962,That process has happened.,27,,
175,0.97,963.962,966.231,We have incorporated all of their feedback into our legislative agenda.,27,,
176,0.97,966.231,975.774,"That means that we have the community police Commission, the office of the inspector general, and the office of police accountability legislative agenda items incorporated into our police reform proposal.",27,,
177,0.97,975.774,979.845,We have heard that at the state level there are over 60 bills on police reform that have been introduced.,27,,
178,0.97,979.845,987.386,We also understand that there is an effort to collect things into omnibus bills to move things forward more easily and just have less proposals on the floor.,27,,
179,0.97,987.386,992.591,There is a focus on a number of different issue areas.,27,,
180,0.97,992.591,994.66,We are supportive of these in the city of Seattle.,27,,
181,0.97,994.66,999.098,"Many of these things, we have already adopted.",27,,
182,0.97,999.098,1001.9,"You know, we are going to be probably looking into some other areas.",27,,
183,0.97,1001.9,1016.882,"The issue areas that they are focusing on our tactics which is things like prohibiting no knock warrants, badge covering, banning the use of military equipment or the purchase of military equipment and limiting less lethal tactics of policing.",27,,
184,0.97,1016.882,1022.688,Training is another area of focus.,27,,
185,0.97,1022.688,1032.831,This includes things like De- escalation and implicit bias.,27,,
186,0.97,1032.831,1036.101,It includes technology so officers can access training from their cell phones on a daily basis.,27,,
187,0.97,1036.101,1047.379,"Investigations and prosecutions of course, it is emerging as something with independent investigations, establishing an independent investigation agency.",27,,
188,0.97,1047.379,1059.825,We could create a special Prosecutor's office and perform post investigation audits.,27,,
189,0.97,1059.825,1064.163,The police funding aspect of things at the state level is a little bit different than it is at a local level.,27,,
190,0.97,1064.163,1066.965,They are looking at adding funding for programs that provide alternatives to policing.,27,,
191,0.97,1066.965,1070.836,That is difficult in a budget year when people are just trying to keep existing services that the state offers.,27,,
192,0.97,1070.836,1080.979,There are an explanation of things like lead and the sequential intercept model as well as expanding funding for behavioral health and looking at 911 Dispatchers.,27,,
193,0.97,1080.979,1083.782,"There is a lot of work on accountability and transparency, decertification.",27,,
194,0.97,1083.782,1110.409,"This includes and also an obligation to intervene, report, disciplinary action for lying on the stand or in a police report, and also mandating community accountability and public funding for public Database on police reform.",27,,
195,0.97,1110.409,1120.152,"As I said, as we are supportive of all of these efforts at the state level, we also recognize that many of you are very focused on arbitration reforms as is the community police Commission, the office of the inspector general, and the office of police accountability.",27,,
196,0.97,1120.152,1124.323,This is as well as advocates in the community.,27,,
197,0.97,1124.323,1139.738,We plan to work in coalition with other Washington cities to address this issue and make sure that it is a significant point of conversation in Olympia.,27,,
198,0.97,1139.738,1154.92,"Just to kind of closeout police reform, I would say that we understand that the decertification proposal that is being led by Senator Jamie Peterson and representative Goodman in the house is a significant area of focus for legislators.",27,,
199,0.97,1154.92,1156.421,It is a very significant piece of legislation.,27,,
200,0.97,1156.421,1158.357,It is 41 pages long.,27,,
201,0.97,1158.357,1185.884,It goes through all sorts of things on the decertification process from changing the mission of the criminal justice training Commission to expanding mandatory and discretionary Revocation criteria and even it changes the proof on disciplinary action to preponderance of the evidence.,27,,
202,0.97,1185.884,1187.586,Some significant changes are being looked at there for sure.,27,,
203,0.97,1187.586,1202.0,"We are also hearing that qualified immunity, establishing a state class of action being led by representative Ty is a significant point of conversation.",27,,
204,0.97,1202.0,1204.736,So is independent investigations; we are waiting to see what the recommendations will be.,27,,
205,0.97,1204.736,1206.572,We are nearing to a close of those conversations.,27,,
206,0.97,1206.572,1215.047,There are two meetings this week.,27,,
207,0.97,1215.047,1216.715,We expect to see some proposals there.,27,,
208,0.97,1216.715,1218.517,And I am also going to shift to housing.,27,,
209,0.97,1218.517,1223.589,I will pause here to see if anybody has any questions on police reforms since it is such a significant issue for us this year.,27,,
210,0.97,1223.589,1227.559,Thank you Robin for that high level view of what you are hearing coming out of our state legislator.,28,,
211,0.97,1227.559,1228.227,I appreciate it.,28,,
212,0.97,1228.227,1243.942,"Colleagues, any comments or questions for Robin as it relates to the police reform aspects of the report?",28,,
213,0.97,1248.614,1249.615,"Councilmember Lisa Herbold, please.",28,,
214,0.97,1249.615,1255.921,"As it relates to reform of the arbitration process, you mentioned that we will be working with other Washington cities to talk about how to advance that conversation.",29,,
215,0.97,1255.921,1263.762,Do you see that as being on a different Timeline or a different track from the state legislative agenda?,29,,
216,0.97,1263.762,1279.778,I recall that I had heard that it was unlikely that items that had an intersection with labor negotiations were likely to be closed during this legislative session.,29,,
217,0.97,1279.778,1305.404,I think that I am hearing from your colleagues and other colleagues in other larger Washington cities that there is definitely some movement to make sure that we discuss arbitration during this legislative session.,30,,
218,0.97,1305.404,1314.379,"As I said, I think many of the reforms that are being discussed have already been adopted in Seattle.",30,,
219,0.97,1314.379,1317.416,"If you go down that list, I do not know what the percentage would be.",30,,
220,0.97,1317.416,1318.617,I think it is quite high.,30,,
221,0.97,1318.617,1330.696,I am hearing applicants in community as well as Councilmembers and mayors around the state that some changes to arbitration would be extremely helpful to making significant change in our policing.,30,,
222,0.97,1330.696,1336.168,I do think that efforts will be made to pursue that during this legislative session.,30,,
223,0.97,1336.168,1338.737,Thank you.,31,,
224,0.97,1338.737,1351.416,"Colleagues, any other questions or comments on the police reform aspects?",31,,
225,0.97,1354.419,1368.734,"Okay, hearing none, Robin I know that you are having communications with many of my colleagues as you all are working on things together.",31,,
226,0.97,1370.702,1376.141,"Your state legislative lobbying agenda, I think many issues you have highlighted in the area of police reform and accountability at the state level are critically important.",31,,
227,0.97,1376.141,1379.344,"As you mentioned, Seattle has already implemented many of those proposals at the local level.",31,,
228,0.97,1379.344,1391.056,And so I do want to signal a strong support and I hope that those will become statewide standards.,31,,
229,0.97,1391.056,1393.558,This is with the understanding that they are not perfect mechanisms.,31,,
230,0.97,1393.558,1402.501,There could be some modification even at the state level from the standards that we have adopted.,31,,
231,0.97,1402.501,1406.004,I think that would be a wise exercise to do to sort of have a lesson's learned approach.,31,,
232,0.97,1406.004,1407.606,I think this would be wise.,31,,
233,0.97,1407.606,1415.781,"And then, Secondly, as it relates to arbitration, I signaled, I communicated this to you all in our meeting.",31,,
234,0.97,1415.781,1427.526,That is a top priority for me as somebody who has been working in the area of police reform and accountability for well over 15 years.,31,,
235,0.97,1427.526,1435.734,I did this first as a civil rights attorney and now as a Councilmember.,31,,
236,0.97,1435.734,1459.357,"The issues related to arbitration and whether it is binding or not binding and whether it is open or closed to the public, and how much value is placed on precedent versus review of issues; this is absolutely critically important to the issues related to public trust and confidence in our civilian led accountability system.",31,,
237,0.97,1459.357,1473.839,"Arbitration has systematically I believe undermined, in the context of police unions, it has consistently undermined the public's confidence.",31,,
238,0.97,1473.839,1475.674,This is in accountability systems.,31,,
239,0.97,1475.674,1483.582,It deals with actually holding officers accountable.,31,,
240,0.97,1483.582,1485.984,This is for behaving in a way that is out of policy.,31,,
241,0.97,1485.984,1505.804,"That to me is tragic, problematic, and it will continue to be, it will continue to be one the causes as to why the public has lost confidence in our accountability systems.",31,,
242,0.97,1505.804,1514.479,"I think it is really, really important for us to be on the same page as it relates to what we want to see reformed in the arbitration process.",31,,
243,0.97,1514.479,1525.991,This relates to police unions and why.,31,,
244,0.97,1526.491,1531.329,I am willing to continue to work with you all on making sure that we are as aligned as we can be as a city.,31,,
245,0.97,1531.329,1539.237,"Certainly, from the city council's perspective, this is an important issue.",31,,
246,0.97,1539.237,1542.841,Those of us who sit on the labor relation's policy committee have thoughts and ideas in this space.,31,,
247,0.97,1542.841,1545.21,We are continuing to explore that in that confidential setting.,31,,
248,0.97,1545.21,1548.346,We will always have conversations with people in order to make this a significant and top priority.,31,,
249,0.97,1548.346,1556.121,This is for the city.,31,,
250,0.97,1556.121,1557.722,Thank you very much Council President.,32,,
251,0.97,1557.722,1566.064,I do think that we will be calling you possibly more than usual for your support to move the arbitration regarding police reform forward in Olympia.,32,,
252,0.97,1566.064,1576.441,Thank you very much.,32,,
253,0.97,1580.745,1581.88,"All right Robin, housing?",33,,
254,0.97,1581.88,1583.081,Do we want to dig into housing?,33,,
255,0.97,1583.081,1584.749,"Housing, this will be fairly quick.",34,,
256,0.97,1584.749,1586.785,I know that you have a strong housing advocate here.,34,,
257,0.97,1586.785,1595.56,"[Laughter] after many years at the office of housing, there are a number of proposals . I think we will be called on to work to protect some funding in housing areas.",34,,
258,0.97,1595.56,1597.329,This is given the budget and what is happening.,34,,
259,0.97,1597.329,1603.001,There will be a push . This is included on the legislative agenda.,34,,
260,0.97,1603.001,1611.509,This will significantly increase the document reporting fee that provides vital resources for homelessness.,34,,
261,0.97,1611.509,1614.412,There will be an investment of $250 Millionin the housing trust fund.,34,,
262,0.97,1614.412,1619.884,There will be rental assistance to prevent people who have been impacted by Covid-19 from losing their homes.,34,,
263,0.97,1619.884,1638.136,"Also, you know, it will Memorialize some of the Eviction moratorium provisions to make sure that people do not lose their homes . Then of course, the office of housing has embarked on an ambitious proposal to create 600 units of supportive housing.",34,,
264,0.97,1638.136,1641.206,They are looking to the state to provide some our information and resources to support that.,34,,
265,0.97,1641.206,1646.044,"Also, there are efforts to do more in the future.",34,,
266,0.97,1646.044,1647.379,There is a good cause Eviction proposal.,34,,
267,0.97,1647.379,1652.183,This will be on the legislative agenda to also support the statewide inaction of that.,34,,
268,0.97,1652.183,1669.634,We already have locally issues that will close loopholes that exist in the local legislation.,34,,
269,0.97,1669.634,1672.871,"Foreclosure prevention and of course the housing justice act, it bans discrimination based on criminal records.",34,,
270,0.97,1672.871,1674.539,We are supporting that so that can be statewide.,34,,
271,0.97,1674.539,1684.883,"And then Finally, you know, there is the overall budget production as I mentioned.",34,,
272,0.97,1684.883,1685.483,Thank you everyone.,34,,
273,0.97,1685.483,1688.586,"If there are no questions on housing, we will go to our state relation's director.",34,,
274,0.97,1688.586,1689.554,Any questions on housing?,35,,
275,0.97,1689.554,1690.789,I see Councilmember Kshama Sawant.,35,,
276,0.97,1690.789,1691.99,"If anybody else has questions, please.",35,,
277,0.97,1691.99,1692.791,Thank you.,36,,
278,0.97,1692.791,1703.368,"First of all, I would like to say the Eviction's protections at the state level are very crucial.",36,,
279,0.97,1703.368,1706.171,I wanted to ask a couple of questions related to housing.,36,,
280,0.97,1706.171,1725.09,One is there has been a real call from Renters and also now working-class and middle-class homeowners who may have had long-term income loss or even job losses.,36,,
281,0.97,1725.09,1730.795,They want to understand what their fate is going to be once the moratoriums on the Eviction's expire.,36,,
282,0.97,1730.795,1742.407,"So what conversations have there been at the state level among the elected officials about canceling rent, mortgage, and utility payments for all of this year?",36,,
283,0.97,1742.407,1751.716,This would prevent what analysts nationwide have said.,36,,
284,0.97,1751.716,1759.424,"If we do not do that, then there will be a massive wave of Evictions when the moratoriums expire.",36,,
285,0.97,1759.424,1761.059,It is not just Seattle or Washington.,36,,
286,0.97,1761.059,1761.659,That is one question.,36,,
287,0.97,1761.659,1764.662,Let me go ahead and ask some of my other questions related to housing.,36,,
288,0.97,1764.662,1774.873,The other is the state invested what I think is a pitiful $175 million in housing.,36,,
289,0.97,1774.873,1775.773,This is over two years.,36,,
290,0.97,1775.773,1790.889,"And so, what is the conversation there about any potential increases in funding for affordable housing?",36,,
291,0.97,1790.889,1794.125,I wanted to tie this to another thing that I will go ahead and mention.,36,,
292,0.97,1794.125,1795.76,You have not mentioned it unfortunately.,36,,
293,0.97,1795.76,1806.004,I think this is the main issue that is looming over the horizon.,36,,
294,0.97,1806.004,1808.173,I feel like the state Legislature should basically start with that.,36,,
295,0.97,1808.173,1821.019,This is the $4.2 billion by annual shortfall in the state budget.,36,,
296,0.97,1826.491,1827.792,"So primarily, what is the conversation?",36,,
297,0.97,1827.792,1829.093,This is a larger question beyond housing.,36,,
298,0.97,1829.093,1833.331,"What is the conversation about preventing these cuts, this shortfall from landing on ordinary people in the form of budget cuts?",36,,
299,0.97,1833.331,1835.934,This would be to services and housing that are already chronically underfunded.,36,,
300,0.97,1835.934,1840.071,"Specifically, on housing, what is the proposal to make this when we are facing such a massive shortfall in the budget?",36,,
301,0.97,1840.071,1841.906,We need to prevent cuts to existing funds on housing.,36,,
302,0.97,1841.906,1850.014,How is that going to be tied to what is actually needed which is increasing the funds for housing?,36,,
303,0.97,1850.014,1851.216,Thank you so much Councilmember.,37,,
304,0.97,1851.216,1853.985,I think I will answer those questions in the order that you asked them.,37,,
305,0.97,1853.985,1863.027,The governor has convened a work group of both property owners and tenants and advocates.,37,,
306,0.97,1863.027,1869.934,They have been having discussions about what to do to address the Eviction moratorium ending.,37,,
307,0.97,1869.934,1886.05,I think that it is widely recognized that this is a very large problem.,37,,
308,0.97,1886.451,1888.419,I do not think anybody has the answers quite yet.,37,,
309,0.97,1888.419,1893.892,"I also think that a lot of this also depends on as I said, you know, the Federal Government and providing additional resources for mental assistance.",37,,
310,0.97,1893.892,1907.305,"You know, we did think that there would be another stimulus package coming through this fall.",37,,
311,0.97,1913.478,1915.013,"With the election tomorrow, that did not happen.",37,,
312,0.97,1915.013,1920.518,"I think that you know, everybody is kind of waiting to see the outcome of the election in order to see how many resources will be available.",37,,
313,0.97,1920.518,1923.488,"I think under any circumstances, there is likely to be some additional stimulus funds.",37,,
314,0.97,1923.488,1926.391,"Depending on the outcome, there is also wildly different scenarios of what might happen.",37,,
315,0.97,1926.391,1930.428,I think that lawmakers at the state level are waiting to see what happens there before they make additional decisions.,37,,
316,0.97,1930.428,1946.311,"So, you know, it is certainly on the minds of many in Olympia and it is a significant issue of course.",37,,
317,0.97,1946.311,1948.413,"You know, I think this falls under the Covid-19 relief umbrella.",37,,
318,0.97,1948.413,1950.348,"If I did not give that enough Airtime, I apologize.",37,,
319,0.97,1950.348,1952.216,It is absolutely something that is considered very important.,37,,
320,0.97,1952.216,1970.868,"As far as the investment in housing, you know, advocates at the housing alliance who we work very closely with our suggesting and they are signaling at this moment that there ask will be $250 million for the housing trust fund.",37,,
321,0.97,1970.868,1972.704,This is a little bit more than the 175 million.,37,,
322,0.97,1972.704,1976.474,I think that would be one the higher investments in the housing trust fund and the state level.,37,,
323,0.97,1976.474,1997.295,"I will say that although of course, we would like to see more and more investment in housing at the state level, when the governor made cuts to the various line items on the budget in order to try and address the impacts that Covid- 19 was having on state revenue, he did not cut any housing or promises programs.",37,,
324,0.97,1997.295,1999.297,Almost no other area of the budget came out unscathed.,37,,
325,0.97,1999.297,2012.443,"That was a signal of how important housing and homelessness is considered by state lawmakers, for sure.",37,,
326,0.97,2017.482,2022.086,"And then, finally your last question, Quinn is going to talk a little bit more about the progressive revenue on our legislative agenda.",37,,
327,0.97,2022.086,2025.123,"As I said, you know, lawmakers have not really come out with what their plan is.",37,,
328,0.97,2025.123,2028.192,We have talked with leadership on all of the Finance Committee's and appropriation's committees.,37,,
329,0.97,2028.192,2032.63,They have all assured us that there is no proposal that is off the table at the moment.,37,,
330,0.97,2032.63,2034.766,"They are discussing you know, all sorts of different scenarios.",37,,
331,0.97,2034.766,2037.902,They have not shared exactly what their plan moving forward would be.,37,,
332,0.97,2037.902,2042.039,When will also talk about that a little bit more as part of his presentation coming up right now.,37,,
333,0.97,2042.039,2048.045,"Councilmember Kshama Sawant, any follow-up questions?",38,,
334,0.97,2048.045,2064.362,I think I do but I think it would make sense for Quinn and others to speak and maybe later.,39,,
335,0.97,2064.362,2065.73,"Okay, thank you Robin for those responses.",40,,
336,0.97,2065.73,2067.765,It sounds like we will head over to Quinn now.,40,,
337,0.97,2067.765,2069.767,Your name has been evoked a few times already.,40,,
338,0.97,2069.767,2071.436,"Welcome, thank you for being with us this morning.",40,,
339,0.97,2071.436,2072.036,Take it away.,40,,
340,0.97,2072.036,2074.872,Thank you so much for having us.,41,,
341,0.97,2074.872,2088.686,So I am going to cover most of the remaining topics on the legislative agenda just to give sort of a preview of what we are looking at.,41,,
342,0.97,2088.686,2091.389,"By way of background, the legislative agenda is our guiding document down in Olympia.",41,,
343,0.97,2091.389,2110.208,It provides the framework for us both as the values that we represent as a city but also the issues that we are allowed to lobby on.,41,,
344,0.97,2110.208,2113.277,"As such, it is a broad document that includes a wide range of issues.",41,,
345,0.97,2113.277,2116.714,I am going to try to touch on the highlights of those broad issues and a couple specifics.,41,,
346,0.97,2116.714,2121.819,"From the outside, I will just note that as we have been building this year's legislative agenda, we have used last year's as a base.",41,,
347,0.97,2121.819,2132.53,"If there is an issue that you are passionate about and you feel it is important, it was in last year's legislative agenda and it is in this year paws.",41,,
348,0.97,2132.53,2135.433,The only reason it would not be is if it is no longer relevant.,41,,
349,0.97,2135.433,2139.637,"For example, we have removed automated enforcement after the bill passed last year.",41,,
350,0.97,2139.637,2141.305,"With that, I will go ahead and jump in.",41,,
351,0.97,2141.305,2147.745,I will try to just hit all of these highlights as quickly as possible.,41,,
352,0.97,2147.745,2166.497,We can take what I am sure will be a variety of questions.,41,,
353,0.97,2166.497,2168.166,Robin covered a few elements of Covid-19 recovery.,41,,
354,0.97,2168.166,2173.771,We have added a new section obviously as the city and communities around the country and the world grapple with the public health crisis that is Covid-19.,41,,
355,0.97,2173.771,2178.075,The city supports rental and Homeowner assistance to ensure that folks who are experiencing hardship are not thrown out of their homes.,41,,

358,0.97,2185.616,2187.785,Most Federal programs do not cover Undocumented immigrants Unfortunately.,41,,
359,0.97,2187.785,2195.56,The state recently announced relief funds and more can be done and should be done.,41,,
360,0.97,2195.56,2201.399,"Finally, in this category, the city supports ensuring that business interruption insurance covers Covid-19.",41,,
361,0.97,2201.399,2214.412,"Possibly the nose significant business interruption that business has ever experienced, apparently there are some insurance plans that do not.",41,,
362,0.97,2214.412,2216.881,We are working with the insurance Commissioner to make sure those are covered.,41,,
363,0.97,2216.881,2226.023,"Moving on to progressive revenue, the city supports progressive state solutions that preserve critical programs well informing the upside down tax structure.",41,,
364,0.97,2226.023,2229.226,"Obviously, this has been an issue that the city has been supportive of for many years.",41,,
365,0.97,2229.226,2232.697,I think it is more acutely felt now than ever with Covid-19.,41,,
366,0.97,2232.697,2235.967,Both the need for more progressive taxation and to reduce alliance on Regressive tax is important.,41,,
367,0.97,2235.967,2251.749,We want to ensure that funding for programs that serve our most needy populations and individuals that need the most support are preserved and expanded at the state level.,41,,
368,0.97,2251.749,2272.737,The city also supports maintaining and expanding local options for more progressive taxation as well as continued support for lifting the 1% cap on growth and property tax receipts that artificially curtail the city's budget . This allows us to more adequately respond to the issues that we have at the local level.,41,,
369,0.97,2272.737,2275.573,"In education and early learning, the city supports full funding for public Úeducation.",41,,
370,0.97,2275.573,2287.318,That includes everything from Pre-K to protecting and expanding on K-12.,41,,
371,0.97,2293.924,2296.36,"This includes improvements to higher education, free community and technical college.",41,,
372,0.97,2296.36,2299.964,The city supports expanding access and the availability of Childcare as well as increasing reimbursement rates with providers.,41,,
373,0.97,2299.964,2305.002,Many of these are struggling during the crisis as are many parents who need Childcare now or will need it when we eventually returned to work.,41,,
374,0.97,2305.002,2318.115,We want to make sure that those facilities and providers remain open after this crisis.,41,,
375,0.97,2322.153,2324.455,The next category is broadly economic justice and worker protections.,41,,
376,0.97,2324.455,2325.523,The city supports secure scheduling statewide.,41,,
377,0.97,2325.523,2328.459,There is a Misclassification of workers and portable benefits that move with workers between jobs.,41,,

380,0.97,2344.075,2345.976,There needs to be something that addresses regulatory hurdles.,41,,
381,0.97,2345.976,2352.95,Many of these are immigrants and they are experiencing issues in the community.,41,,
382,0.97,2352.95,2361.459,"In criminal justice, the city supports easing the transition for previously incarcerated individuals and expanding diversion programs to direct offenders away from the Correctional system.",41,,
383,0.97,2361.459,2369.834,The city supports reforms to Dwl s 3. this is a technical term.,41,,
384,0.97,2369.834,2374.672,This deals with license suspensions from Non-Payments of traffic citations.,41,,
385,0.97,2374.672,2376.941,This forms an official cycle for folks who are in poverty.,41,,
386,0.97,2376.941,2380.378,They become trapped in poverty.,41,,
387,0.97,2380.378,2394.792,"The city supports increasing protections for domestic violence victims, full funding to process the sexual assault kit backlog . We want protections for those who are working in sex work . We want consequences for those who are profiting from exploitation.",41,,

395,0.97,2450.447,2454.718,"In transportation, there is a new legislative agenda.",41,,
396,0.97,2454.718,2460.958,"There is a new section that includes support for state funding for the West Seattle high bridge, repair or replacement.",41,,
397,0.97,2460.958,2465.463,This will Reconnect West Seattle to Seattle and the region.,41,,
398,0.97,2465.463,2476.24,It will Reconnect the court and the Maritime industrial areas to businesses and industries across the state.,41,,

402,0.97,2499.797,2512.61,I to want to have Hannah cover human services issues.,41,,
403,0.97,2512.61,2518.315,I will stop there and I will see if there are any questions on the wide ranging gamut of issues that we are expecting for the legislator.,41,,
404,0.97,2518.315,2518.916,Thank you Quinn.,42,,
405,0.97,2518.916,2523.32,"Colleagues, do you have any questions or comments?",42,,
406,0.97,2523.32,2529.894,"Councilmember Lisa Herbold, please.",42,,
407,0.97,2529.894,2541.272,Could you talk a little bit more in detail about what the transportation funds related options might be for addressing the closure of the West Seattle bridge?,43,,
408,0.97,2541.272,2565.563,Thank you for putting it within the context of not just to the needs of residents of West Seattle and the surrounding neighborhoods but also within a larger umbrella of regional needs associated with our economic issues.,43,,
409,0.97,2567.131,2567.464,Absolutely.,44,,
410,0.97,2567.464,2568.265,That is a good point.,44,,
411,0.97,2568.265,2570.267,I know that is a message that is important.,44,,
412,0.97,2570.267,2574.371,It is not just an asset for the city but it is an asset for the region and the state.,44,,
413,0.97,2574.371,2586.951,"Just to clarify, did you want to hear more about the potential local transportation options or the options that the state is considering for a statewide transportation package?",44,,
414,0.97,2586.951,2587.184,All.,45,,
415,0.97,2587.184,2587.751,[Laughter],45,,
416,0.97,2587.751,2588.385,Of course.,46,,
417,0.97,2588.385,2603.0,"So, last year, several members in transportation considered various forms of a statewide transportation revenue package.",47,,
418,0.97,2603.0,2607.738,Senator Hobbs who is the chair of the Senate transportation committee put out a proposal that would have funded a wide variety of projects.,47,,
419,0.97,2607.738,2612.876,His proposal was predominantly funded by a carbon pricing system.,47,,
420,0.97,2612.876,2627.391,I think that there is a lot of interest in that as a revenue option.,47,,
421,0.97,2627.391,2633.23,"This is at least as the predominant option in addition to you know, some of the more traditional vehicle weight fees.",47,,
422,0.97,2633.23,2635.065,And it deals with supplementary options.,47,,
423,0.97,2635.065,2643.44,There was also in that proposal a statewide commercial impact fee.,47,,
424,0.97,2643.44,2646.844,This is as well as a statewide Tmcp.,47,,
425,0.97,2646.844,2651.749,That is something we are always on the lookout for and aware of.,47,,
426,0.97,2651.749,2668.399,Representative Jake who is the chair of the House transportation committee has been holding a wide range of listening sessions this interim.,47,,
427,0.97,2670.701,2672.87,This is to develop a proposal that he is putting together.,47,,
428,0.97,2672.87,2674.938,This has included meetings with a whole range of Stakeholders.,47,,
429,0.97,2674.938,2677.141,The city of Seattle has participated in two of those.,47,,
430,0.97,2677.141,2686.817,"They cover the range from labor to environmental activists to transit activists, to businesses and business communities.",47,,
431,0.97,2686.817,2690.954,They are really working to hear from everybody as they assemble their package.,47,,
432,0.97,2690.954,2703.467,"And then, I know a handful of other legislators are considering various forms.",47,,
433,0.97,2707.471,2708.305,Or they are Prioritizing projects.,47,,
434,0.97,2708.305,2711.875,"Obviously, last year, the West Seattle bridge was not yet the issue that we knew it to be.",47,,
435,0.97,2711.875,2713.911,"So, the proposals from last year do not include it.",47,,
436,0.97,2713.911,2718.649,We are engaging with legislators to ensure that that does wind up in the proposals and it is something that is included.,47,,
437,0.97,2718.649,2730.127,"At the local level, I think that most momentum does seem to be around expanding options that have already existed at local governments.",47,,
438,0.97,2730.127,2744.942,"Predominantly through the transportation benefit expanding the tales packs as well as providing utility tax authority, the one proposal that seems to have some momentum was introduced last year.",47,,
439,0.97,2744.942,2747.511,It seems likely to move forward if a broader package moves forward.,47,,
440,0.97,2747.578,2759.356,His is a local option G we are continuing to look at trying to push for some more progressive options.,47,,
441,0.97,2759.356,2763.76,Those are the ones that are sort of most in play among legislators and other Stakeholders.,47,,
442,0.97,2763.76,2767.531,Thank you.,48,,
443,0.97,2767.531,2778.075,Any other questions for Quinn?,48,,
444,0.97,2785.649,2787.284,Councilmember Alex Pedersen and then Councilmember Kshama Sawant.,48,,
445,0.97,2787.284,2788.051,Thank you.,49,,
446,0.97,2788.051,2789.82,"Thank you Oir team, I appreciate this informative meeting.",49,,
447,0.97,2789.82,2791.889,Thank you for taking the time to meet with us already.,49,,
448,0.97,2791.889,2817.915,"Regarding state taxes, state tax laws, I understood that if progressive revenue, additional progressive revenue were introduced and we wanted to locally reduce the sales tax, there would be some limitation to doing that.",49,,
449,0.97,2817.915,2823.787,"Or if we reduce it at the city level, accounting can just scoop up the revenue from that so that the consumer is still paying the same sales tax.",49,,
450,0.97,2823.787,2829.092,"If we really wanted to reduce the sales tax for the end consumer and user of that, there would need to be a change to state law.",49,,
451,0.97,2829.092,2830.894,Could you talk about that a little bit?,49,,
452,0.97,2830.894,2832.329,I can talk briefly about that.,50,,
453,0.97,2832.329,2835.132,"It is an issue and Councilmember, I appreciate your office liking this for us.",50,,
454,0.97,2835.132,2840.838,This is an issue that is a little more complicated.,50,,
455,0.97,2840.838,2843.74,It does appear that there would be need to be a change in state law.,50,,
456,0.97,2843.74,2846.743,"Currently, citizen County has almost a reciprocal sales tax authority.",50,,
457,0.97,2846.743,2855.052,"If we reduced our sales tax, it would in effect be absorbed by King county by default.",50,,
458,0.97,2855.052,2874.171,So we would need to proceed with a change in state law to allow us to reduce our sales tax without it automatically being absorbed by the county.,50,,
459,0.97,2874.171,2876.473,I know that is of interest to you and other Councilmembers.,50,,
460,0.97,2876.473,2878.242,That is something that we are digging into more.,50,,
461,0.97,2878.242,2887.985,We will continue to work with you on it.,50,,
462,0.97,2887.985,2888.385,Thank you.,51,,
463,0.97,2888.385,2895.092,"And just to clarify, I would really like to see the state enact additional progressive revenue so that we have a net gain in revenue to the city of Seattle for our priorities.",51,,
464,0.97,2895.092,2898.195,It would also be nice to reduce some of the Regressive taxes if we could.,51,,
465,0.97,2898.195,2900.564,"Again, we will still end up with a net gain in revenue.",51,,
466,0.97,2900.564,2903.166,We will soften the pain of the Regressive sales tax.,51,,
467,0.97,2903.166,2908.105,Thank you.,51,,
468,0.97,2908.105,2909.373,Thank you Councilmember Alex Pedersen.,52,,
469,0.97,2909.373,2909.973,Councilmember Kshama Sawant.,52,,
470,0.97,2909.973,2915.913,Thank you President Lorena Gonzcez.,53,,
471,0.97,2915.913,2927.824,I am sorry if I missed if you mentioned this Quinn.,53,,
472,0.97,2934.765,2938.402,The question I had was is there actual momentum for a significant tax or any tax on big business?,53,,
473,0.97,2938.402,2939.736,I know you said a few things.,53,,
474,0.97,2939.736,2956.253,I did not quite catch if there was anything concrete happening at the state level II either increase taxes on big business or to have a closing of the existing corporate tax loopholes or taxes on wealthy households.,53,,
475,0.97,2956.253,2959.456,I know that there is talk about it but there is talk about it every year.,53,,
476,0.97,2959.456,2980.177,"The question is, is there more momentum this year given that there is an even more amount of suffering for working people and marginalized communities with both joblessness and even with joblessness, we have covered this regarding income losses and confronting the realities of the pandemic.",53,,
477,0.97,2980.177,2981.178,That is one question.,53,,
478,0.97,2981.178,2986.483,"Related to that is the momentum for significant capital gains tax or you know, any other kind of Progressive taxes.",53,,
479,0.97,2986.483,2996.46,Related to that is what are we hearing more recently on any potential Preemption of invisible big business taxes?,53,,
480,0.97,2996.46,3006.57,"We know that earlier this year when we were pushing for the tax year, the big business tax here, I know that there was conversation there.",53,,
481,0.97,3006.57,3014.311,The movement actually went there and confronted legislators face to face saying you cannot do this.,53,,
482,0.97,3014.311,3015.212,This is just unconscionable.,53,,
483,0.97,3015.212,3026.323,That was defeated because ordinary people fought back.,53,,
484,0.97,3026.323,3029.025,Now we have heard from the central budget office here in the city.,53,,
485,0.97,3029.025,3030.927,This is when they presented the Mayor's proposed budget.,53,,
486,0.97,3030.927,3035.699,There might be a danger that state lawmakers would again talk about Preempting a tax that was passed in the city.,53,,
487,0.97,3035.699,3042.539,"Absolutely, thank you Councilmember Kshama Sawant.",54,,
488,0.97,3042.539,3048.445,"Apologies, I got wrapped up in discussing the legislative agenda.",54,,
489,0.97,3048.445,3048.779,I apologize.,54,,
490,0.97,3048.779,3051.047,"Thank you . to apologize at all,",54,,
491,0.97,3051.047,3061.458,"Yes, I would say that there is more momentum this year for Progressive taxation than the previous years.",55,,
492,0.97,3061.458,3068.965,"To be Frank, I think that there is perhaps less momentum than there was in the summer when the budget was bigger.",55,,
493,0.97,3068.965,3077.274,"Over the summer, the revenue forecast for the budget outlook was for almost $10 million.",55,,
494,0.97,3077.274,3078.341,"Obviously, that is less now.",55,,
495,0.97,3078.341,3090.086,"While I believe 4.6 billion is no small gap, I will say that there is perhaps slightly less concern for this.",55,,
496,0.97,3090.086,3093.957,"That said, I do think that there is a possibility for Progressive revenue at the state level this year.",55,,
497,0.97,3093.957,3107.17,"This is not just from advocates but hearing from legislators and from leaders in the budget committees, they have made clear that all options are on the table.",55,,
498,0.97,3107.17,3117.314,"We say thinking about something like a capital gains tax or a tax on excess compensation, I do think that these are possibilities.",55,,
499,0.97,3117.314,3132.929,It is a difficult thing to try to Prognosticate especially before we have gotten to the legislative session.,55,,
500,0.97,3132.929,3136.733,That is sort of my best guess and sense from the conversation that we have had with citizen Stakeholders.,55,,
501,0.97,3136.733,3155.418,"With regards to Preemption, again as Robin said, I think that with regards to progressive revenue, you know, while all options are on the table, I do think that budget leaders are in some sense, holding their cards close to their chest.",55,,
502,0.97,3155.418,3158.555,I think that Preemption is something that we always need to be on the lookout for.,55,,
503,0.97,3158.555,3163.627,This is not just on revenue but on regulatory elements in the city.,55,,
504,0.97,3163.627,3177.073,"It is again, I know that this is not the best answer but it is the most truthful answer.",55,,
505,0.97,3177.073,3178.875,This is something we have had partners about.,55,,
506,0.97,3178.875,3180.677,This is not something about any sort of definitive movement.,55,,
507,0.97,3180.677,3186.483,"While we remain vigilant on Preemption, I do not know that we can say definitively there is an effort to try to deal with the city's progressive resources.",55,,
508,0.97,3186.483,3188.184,"Yes, please keep an eye on that.",56,,
509,0.97,3188.184,3192.489,I know that everybody in the Council will be interested in hearing about that.,56,,
510,0.97,3192.489,3196.293,Absolutely.,57,,
511,0.97,3196.293,3198.395,Thank you Councilmember Kshama Sawant and thank you Quinn.,58,,
512,0.97,3198.395,3203.4,Any other questions for Quinn?,58,,
513,0.97,3203.4,3205.468,"Okay, hearing none, let's keep going through the presentation.",58,,
514,0.97,3205.468,3207.103,We are running out of time here.,58,,
515,0.97,3207.103,3212.576,We probably have about eight minutes for this.,58,,
516,0.97,3212.576,3218.415,We got started a little later on this presentation.,58,,
517,0.97,3218.415,3226.79,I am just doing a time check for purposes of the rest of the presentation.,58,,
518,0.97,3226.79,3229.025,"Okay, thank you Council president and thank you Councilmembers.",59,,
519,0.97,3229.025,3238.134,"For the human services portfolio this session, we are going to be focused on preserving programs and trying not to lose any ground.",59,,
520,0.97,3238.134,3240.203,We will be focusing on progressing the social safety net.,59,,
521,0.97,3240.203,3250.947,"With such a big budget cap and so little of the state budget being flexible, we are hearing that human services programs are an area for potential cuts.",59,,
522,0.97,3250.947,3260.523,"Some of the policies that passed last session, implementation was delayed in the first round of budget Vetoes early on in the pandemic.",59,,
523,0.97,3260.523,3263.36,We will be fighting to get this implemented as well this year.,59,,
524,0.97,3263.36,3266.463,An example of that is the extension of Medicaid to individuals Postpartum.,59,,
525,0.97,3266.463,3276.573,This is something Councilmembers were interested in last session.,59,,
526,0.97,3276.573,3278.975,That will be back and we will be working on that as well.,59,,
527,0.97,3278.975,3282.312,Some good news with the pandemic was that there is increased flexibility for some programs.,59,,
528,0.97,3282.312,3296.66,This is like Telehealth and human service advocates will be looking to make some of those changes of flexibility more permanent through legislation.,59,,
529,0.97,3296.66,3300.196,One area we are watching closely that is a high priority for Hsd is long-term care services.,59,,
530,0.97,3300.196,3302.499,"Again, there is some threat to budget cuts there.",59,,
531,0.97,3302.499,3310.073,"As a payment continues, we know that providing care to the elderly and others in home versus a nursing home is even more important.",59,,
532,0.97,3310.073,3311.908,We will be working to protect funding for that.,59,,
533,0.97,3311.908,3324.721,Homelessness funding and support will be as always fighting for additional funding for Covid-19 safe shelter and date and hygiene centers.,59,,
534,0.97,3324.721,3337.734,"In behavioral health, there has been a lot of work being done by the behavioral health recovery system transformation task force.",59,,
535,0.97,3337.734,3339.035,That group includes legislators and staff.,59,,
536,0.97,3339.035,3348.445,They just completed and presented draft recommendations in the last week or so.,59,,
537,0.97,3348.445,3349.679,This is for consideration in 2021.,59,,
538,0.97,3349.679,3352.349,We will be watching those to see what really shakes out in legislation.,59,,
539,0.97,3352.349,3375.472,"The recommendations include some state oversight and coordination, workforce enhancements to encourage people to enter the behavioral health field, developing additional physical infrastructure so that there are options for more care settings and many other items.",59,,
540,0.97,3375.472,3378.742,"So, we know that the human services safety net is one that people always rely on.",59,,
541,0.97,3378.742,3382.378,That is especially true now with increased economic struggles and other issues.,59,,
542,0.97,3382.378,3383.78,That is where we will be watching.,59,,
543,0.97,3383.78,3397.026,"Note that our conversations with some of you so far, food and other programs are really important to continue protecting and also making sure that they can be accessed by Undocumented immigrant communities.",59,,
544,0.97,3397.026,3402.499,That is my quick overview of what we expect on the human services portfolio.,59,,
545,0.97,3402.499,3408.405,"If there are questions, please ask them.",59,,
546,0.97,3408.405,3419.916,Any questions or comments for Hannah?,60,,
547,0.97,3419.916,3421.785,"Okay, I am not seeing any hands being raised.",60,,
548,0.97,3421.785,3423.219,It looks like people understand that clearly.,60,,
549,0.97,3423.219,3432.328,I do want to thank you for emphasizing that last point around equal access to human service programs for immigrants and refugees.,60,,
550,0.97,3432.328,3443.873,This is regardless of immigration status.,60,,
551,0.97,3445.208,3446.943,We really do appreciate an emphasis on that.,60,,
552,0.97,3446.943,3463.359,"We appreciate the governor's recent announcement around a fund specifically for immigrants and immigrants who are Undocumented and they want to continue to be a good partner with the city on making sure that those, that limited dollars at the state are not excluding some of our most vulnerable populations.",60,,
553,0.97,3463.359,3468.465,"Of course, these are the Undocumented immigrant populations.",60,,
554,0.97,3468.465,3477.64,They have zero access to any other type of Federal relief in a Covid-19 recovery package.,60,,
555,0.97,3477.64,3479.275,I really appreciate our ongoing cooperation in that space.,60,,
556,0.97,3479.275,3480.643,Thank you for that.,60,,
557,0.97,3480.643,3490.92,Definitely.,61,,
558,0.97,3498.661,3499.195,Go ahead Hannah.,62,,
559,0.97,3499.195,3503.5,"With that, I was just going to close out with a little bit of next steps for the legislative agenda.",63,,
560,0.97,3503.5,3504.467,That sounds good.,64,,
561,0.97,3504.467,3506.102,It looks like we are ready for that.,64,,
562,0.97,3506.102,3506.469,Great.,65,,
563,0.97,3506.469,3509.505,"As the Council President mentioned, we will be back in front of you on November 30.",65,,
564,0.97,3509.505,3513.209,This will be between now and then when we will continue to get input from all of you.,65,,
565,0.97,3513.209,3515.211,It is from those of you we have not met.,65,,

584,0.97,3616.412,3642.605,"Many of us stand at the ready to make those calls and have those meetings with our state legislators in order to be helpful and accessible as we continue to make the case for why certain statewide legislative fixes are important, not just to Seattle but to the entire state of Washington.",68,,

590,0.97,3670.033,3696.492,It will be really helpful to the state lobbying team for you all to keep an eye out for those communications and to create a little bit of time in your schedule and in the schedule of your staff members to review the lobbying agenda and to provide our state lobbying team with some feedback in order to make sure that the lobbying agenda does reflect our priorities and that is what we will be presenting in December.,68,,
591,0.97,3696.492,3699.862,This does not mean that we will not make changes or modifications to the state lobbying agenda.,68,,

673,0.97,4143.739,4145.741,I similarly do not have a whole lot to report.,78,,
674,0.97,4145.741,4148.944,There are no items sponsored by me or from the homelessness strategies and investments committee.,78,,
675,0.97,4148.944,4150.813,This is on the full counsel agenda this afternoon.,78,,
676,0.97,4150.813,4154.45,I will just be Flacking for constituents that I will have a town hall meeting this Friday.,78,,
677,0.97,4154.45,4165.961,"This will be via zoom, Youtube, all of the virtual platforms.",78,,
678,0.97,4171.834,4173.569,"That is on Friday, November 6 at 3:30 P.M.",78,,
679,0.97,4173.569,4175.771,That Townhall will be recorded for folks who cannot make it.,78,,
680,0.97,4175.771,4178.941,It will be posted on my Website per past Townhall that my office has conducted.,78,,
681,0.97,4178.941,4180.876,It will be my second Townhall during the budget process.,78,,
682,0.97,4180.876,4183.679,I look forward to hearing about the priorities that folks in the District have.,78,,
683,0.97,4183.679,4186.615,I would like to get feedback in the middle of our budget process.,78,,
684,0.97,4186.615,4195.491,I did just want to give a shout out to an Email all of us received from our Co-Lead regarding a collaboration on the Chinatown Id district . It is called just care.,78,,
685,0.97,4195.491,4217.012,"I think this is illustrative of the approach . This deals with this counsel, the providers, and the Mayor's office, they have been moving toward this of having a provider centered outreach strategy that centers problem-solving rather than a presumption of removal.",78,,
686,0.97,4217.012,4219.415,This is without collaborative working to address people's needs.,78,,
687,0.97,4219.415,4240.669,"That project in the Pioneer square in the U district just care is a collaboration between reach, Co-Lead, the county, the city, and a variety of other providers including the Asian counseling and referral services, the team Seattle Club, and a lot of other great providers in our community.",78,,
688,0.97,4240.669,4241.604,They are doing Impactful work.,78,,
689,0.97,4241.604,4268.43,The just care had a particularly good outreach session with a particularly problematic encampment that had been underneath Interstate 5 and had been flagged by the precinct as an issue as far as being a Hub of human trafficking and property crime.,78,,
690,0.97,4268.43,4280.476,This is in addition to being a concern that it would hurt business.,78,,
691,0.97,4280.476,4282.378,There was a colossal amount of people living in it.,78,,
692,0.97,4282.378,4294.59,"Instead of doing what might have been done in the past in terms of signaling the area for a sweep, just care was able to do individual assessments for 68 individuals living in the encampment.",78,,
693,0.97,4294.59,4306.535,"People were able to be assisted with relocation assistance, hotels, and a variety of other Wraparound services through the Marriott collaborating buyers.",78,,
694,0.97,4306.535,4322.418,This offers a really good example of how this new system of doing outreach that is being upheld by the city can work and be an effective replacement.,78,,
695,0.97,4322.418,4340.336,"I just look forward to seeing, as this becomes a citywide strategy rather than a unique collaboration in the Chinatown Id, through just care, I look forward to the Scalability of an approach like just care.",78,,
696,0.97,4340.336,4342.538,With that Madam President I do not have any other updates.,78,,
697,0.97,4342.538,4346.041,Thank you so much Councilmember Andrew J. Lewis for that report and example that you provided.,79,,

708,0.97,4394.156,4401.463,"As folks will recall, the idea is to have small-scale outdoor distant meetings where constituents and districts can talk directly with us.",80,,
709,0.97,4401.463,4417.513,This will be on issues that they are having.,80,,

711,0.97,4420.315,4422.184,"Or, you can sign up by the newsletter.",80,,
712,0.97,4422.184,4431.727,"Last week, I did meet with constituents in New Holly to discuss and encampment at the senior park.",80,,
713,0.97,4431.727,4435.597,"There we go, we lost you for a moment but it looks like we got you back.",81,,

720,0.97,4454.016,4455.751,Okay.,82,,
721,0.97,4455.751,4471.366,"The encampment at the park, we wanted to speak with folks who were living there.",82,,
722,0.97,4471.366,4476.939,We wanted to begin to see how we can come up with a plan together to address some of the concerns coming from the surrounding neighborhood.,82,,

732,0.97,4530.025,4532.895,There are no items from the Finance and housing Committee on today's full council agenda.,84,,
733,0.97,4532.895,4536.932,"This afternoon in full Council, I would love to have your support on a proclamation that we are bringing forward.",84,,
734,0.97,4536.932,4539.601,The proclamation retroactively recognizes affordable housing which was October 12 through 16th.,84,,
735,0.97,4539.601,4542.004,We celebrated and participated in a number of activities that week.,84,,
736,0.97,4542.004,4557.052,"As we have done in the past years, we want to make sure that there is a proclamation to recognize the good work of housing organizations and advocates.",84,,
737,0.97,4557.052,4568.13,"We want to make sure that we are recognizing the work that they are doing and what they are continuing to fight for for deep policy changes to make them more inclusive, equitable, and affordable.",84,,
738,0.97,4568.13,4571.266,"Recognizing this good work, we are interested in putting forward this proclamation for historical purposes.",84,,
739,0.97,4571.266,4574.937,Folks may know that we need to scale up our affordable housing investments in order to meet this need.,84,,
740,0.97,4574.937,4582.644,This is according to the affordable housing task force.,84,,
741,0.97,4582.644,4588.55,"The estimate 156,000 more affordable homes and units for us to be able to house folks in this city and in this region will be added by the year 2040.",84,,
742,0.97,4588.55,4594.189,This will ensure that no late income family or working households are cost burdens in our region.,84,,
743,0.97,4594.189,4604.366,"I also participated as you may remember in the kickoff event for that week with Richard Ross, the author of the color of law.",84,,
744,0.97,4604.366,4605.4,This was a very good book.,84,,
745,0.97,4605.4,4607.603,I also participated with a Councilmember and others.,84,,
746,0.97,4607.603,4635.33,It was a great panel recorded on Townhall.,84,,
747,0.97,4635.33,4643.138,"Thank you to them and the housing development consortium who put together the forum to focus on the legacy of discriminatory housing policies and practices including racist Redline, restrictive race covenants and exclusive zoning that continues until today.",84,,
748,0.97,4643.138,4647.175,"How does segregation create disparities in affordable housing opportunities where black, indigenous, and people of color communities are there today?",84,,
749,0.97,4647.175,4649.645,We wanted to lift up this work through a proclamation this year.,84,,
750,0.97,4649.645,4653.749,This is especially in light of the ongoing pandemic and the calls to stay home in order to be healthy.,84,,
751,0.97,4653.749,4661.456,We know that the individuals who are living housing unstable are more likely to be people of color and those experiencing homelessness.,84,,
752,0.97,4661.456,4664.96,This is very similar to those who are more likely to both contract and die from Covid-19.,84,,
753,0.97,4664.96,4673.869,"We want to make sure that we are looking at these compounding disparities as we address our investments in the city for housing, public health, and other policies that support the social determinants of health.",84,,
754,0.97,4673.869,4698.393,"I look forward to working with you as we lift up the good work, not just the housing advocates but it deals with what they do throughout the year to make sure that there is a safe place to call home.",84,,
755,0.97,4698.393,4702.698,It is core to being healthy and it is a core public health component in addressing the social determinants of health.,84,,
756,0.97,4702.698,4704.833,I believe my staff circulated the proclamation late last week.,84,,
757,0.97,4704.833,4706.368,We should have received an Email from Aaron.,84,,
