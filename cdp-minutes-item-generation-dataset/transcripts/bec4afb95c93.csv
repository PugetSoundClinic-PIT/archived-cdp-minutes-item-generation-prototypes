390,0.97,2433.564,2438.002,They wanted to make sure I graduated from high school and all of that.,59,,
391,0.97,2438.002,2445.242,They helped us both understand--they helped us understand the cultural context in which we were in.,59,,

394,0.97,2463.828,2468.332,Because my mother had different ideas and didn't think I should do that.,59,,
395,0.97,2468.332,2474.572,It was because community was so important and the value I placed on community has shaped how I looked at the path of my work.,59,,

403,0.97,2503.801,2513.544,"Some of the housing things that have fallen into the work I have done is asset management, property operations, and some level of development.",59,,
404,0.97,2513.544,2523.053,I also wanted to work for community and I'm lucky to do so both in the Rainier Valley and in the China town Id.,59,,
405,0.97,2523.053,2526.257,The China town Id I will say is a very good teacher.,59,,
406,0.97,2526.257,2530.694,You learn a lot of things while you are working in that community.,59,,
407,0.97,2530.694,2539.737,I had great mentors and support around me that helped show me what the work needs to be and how we get work done.,59,,
408,0.97,2539.737,2546.977,I had often thought that maybe I would end up working in the city.,59,,

411,0.97,2557.888,2564.962,"So if confirmed, I have the privilege of being at this job in the specific time where the need for housing is great as you have said.",59,,
412,0.97,2564.962,2569.533,Homelessness and public safety are the biggest concerns of city residents.,59,,
413,0.97,2569.533,2574.538,"Our staff and partners, especially those who work on the ground have been through very trying times.",59,,
414,0.97,2574.538,2580.01,"If confirmed, I look forward to working with you as I have with some of you for quite a while now.",59,,
415,0.97,2580.01,2585.316,I think you have heard from some people that said I'm pretty authentic.,59,,
416,0.97,2585.316,2591.221,I think that's a nice way of saying whatever it is they are saying.,59,,
417,0.97,2591.221,2598.062,"And honestly, as Joel Ing referred to, I don't think I could change who I am at my core, even if I tried.",59,,
418,0.97,2598.062,2602.399,I do like to learn new things but the inside of me is pretty well locked in.,59,,

420,0.97,2605.936,2608.572,I appreciated the time thinking through the questions.,59,,
421,0.97,2608.572,2617.014,"Since I Transitioned to this new place known as the city, it is so different than China town.",59,,
422,0.97,2617.014,2619.583,It has been a good experience to go through the questions.,59,,
423,0.97,2619.583,2625.456,I think it is time to start the conversation.,59,,
424,0.97,2625.456,2630.828,Thank you very much.,60,,

436,0.97,2716.313,2723.587,"Thank you to the response where you noted the importance of bringing the development lens to this role, focused on housing.",61,,
437,0.97,2723.587,2728.559,Can you talk a little bit about what housing and means?,61,,

441,0.97,2746.043,2757.888,I think housing and--I might be stealing a phrase from the housing development consortium because they had a series with that.,62,,
442,0.97,2757.888,2763.026,"For me, because of where I have done my past work, it is never just about the housing.",62,,
443,0.97,2763.026,2774.338,"It is about the ground floor, commercial spaces and how they intersect with the greater community, what is the added benefits you can get from just the housing.",62,,
444,0.97,2774.338,2783.881,"As the city of Seattle makes an investment, what else do we need to think about for the people who are living there, the residents around the neighborhood, how do they interact with the building?",62,,
445,0.97,2783.881,2790.254,I think the residents of the neighborhood really are looking at the other opportunities that the building can provide.,62,,
446,0.97,2790.254,2807.004,"Some of the work that my organizations have done in the past small businesses, it could be a clinic, it could be a branch of the Seattle public library, community centers, and our city honestly is very expensive.",62,,
447,0.97,2807.004,2809.94,So you should be thinking about maximizing the space that you have.,62,,
448,0.97,2809.94,2814.511,So what is it that we should be bringing to this?,62,,
449,0.97,2814.511,2824.021,"I think in the office of housing, we are really good at building the housing but it is really thinking a little bit, what else could be there?",62,,
450,0.97,2824.021,2825.856,What else should be there?,62,,
451,0.97,2825.856,2826.69,Who holds that information?,62,,
452,0.97,2826.69,2832.896,"So go over and speak with the people on the floor that is next to us, the office of economic development.",62,,
453,0.97,2832.896,2838.101,Or check in with the people at Opcd or just figure that out.,62,,
454,0.97,2838.101,2840.571,What else should it be that we should be doing there?,62,,
455,0.97,2840.571,2844.775,That is a little bit of my lens on that.,62,,
456,0.97,2844.775,2845.943,"Great, wonderful.",63,,
457,0.97,2845.943,2853.917,I'm just going to lock around real quick to see if there are additional questions.,63,,

461,0.97,2864.161,2888.719,"Before I go into that, I want to mention that one of our Testifiers today spoke to the long hours that Mako spends working on the office of housing obligations.",64,,
462,0.97,2888.719,2893.59,I can definitely speak to my own knowledge of that.,64,,
463,0.97,2893.59,2901.865,"In response to an Email she sent me last night, I think it was probably after 11:00 at night.",64,,
464,0.97,2901.865,2912.009,Definitely a hard worker and committed for as long as I have known her which I think has been a lot of years now.,64,,

466,0.97,2928.358,2955.619,"I appreciate the willingness to push in this area, to find out why there is some resistance to these policies and how we can work together with developers and owners to improve the policy and strengthen it and have more people participate so that we can really meet our critical Antidisplacement goals.",64,,
467,0.97,2955.619,2968.832,"Also, really appreciate the materials that speak to the interests in the city's intent to spell policy in rapid acquisition program.",64,,
468,0.97,2968.832,2985.983,"And also how that can align with our keen interest in removing housing from the stock market, particularly housing that is occupied by people who need affordable housing.",64,,
469,0.97,2985.983,2996.66,"You know, we know that there are new opportunities with the change, legal landscape, strengthening the policies moving forward.",64,,
470,0.97,2996.66,3007.771,I really look forward to working on that in the upcoming year.,64,,
471,0.97,3007.771,3012.542,"Lastly, I want to plug an issue that I have mentioned before.",64,,
472,0.97,3012.542,3017.147,We want to see more affordable housing developed in West Seattle.,64,,
473,0.97,3017.147,3034.398,There is a coalition of community organizations that have been advocating for years to attract development and our reports show that investments in affordable housing have been concentrated in a handful of areas and not so much in West Seattle.,64,,
474,0.97,3034.398,3041.271,Really appreciate the response to the question about the challenge.,64,,
475,0.97,3041.271,3052.883,It really points to the areas of opportunities and the comprehensive plan and the housing levy development to create more equitable geographic spread throughout the city.,64,,
476,0.97,3052.883,3085.849,"And as it relates to sort of a geographic specific effort, I look forward to working more on the efforts around the do more, Seattle city light plus Substation so that we can realize the neighborhood's dreams of an affordable housing offering with ground floor commercial space at that particular location.",64,,

485,0.97,3157.287,3177.908,"So for presumably the new director for the office of housing, just wanted to hear more about what your connection will be with the King County regional homelessness organization that is now stood up and doing good work and so we want to make sure they are successful.",66,,
486,0.97,3177.908,3184.381,"So, you know, the notion of housing first, getting people into low income housing as quickly as possible.",66,,

488,0.97,3190.754,3198.328,"Getting into the permanent housing is so important and we have 14,000 units that we subsidize.",66,,
489,0.97,3198.328,3214.01,"So the question is, what will you be doing to work directly to help place people from--there is a list of people they need to place.",66,,
490,0.97,3214.01,3215.879,The Hoa is helping.,66,,
491,0.97,3215.879,3240.437,"And in terms of asset management in the portfolio and work enabling the Nonprofits that operate that housing that we subsidize, how are we making sure they are opening their doors to people experiencing homelessness and filling up all of their vacancies so they are 100% occupied?",66,,
492,0.97,3240.437,3243.039,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Pedersen.",67,,
493,0.97,3243.039,3250.914,I think the first question you had is really related to the Oh regional homelessness authority relationship.,67,,
494,0.97,3250.914,3261.825,I would say I think you are Sloult right in having myself report to deputy Mayor Washington in over seeing housing.,67,,
495,0.97,3261.825,3287.35,"I think in the time I have been here, a little over three months next week, that has been a big focus of the work, understanding what role the regional homelessness authority plays, what is our role in the relationship, and just trying to build a relationship and understanding what the different processes are for getting, for meeting everyone's needs related to the homelessness crisis we are in.",67,,
496,0.97,3287.35,3297.927,It kind of goes back to the second question which we have about the asset management portion of the portfolio.,67,,
497,0.97,3297.927,3311.408,There are--the range of people who fall into homelessness at this point is much more diverse than it was when we started working years ago.,67,,
498,0.97,3311.408,3320.317,"Depending on what the product is we have and the support the individual may need, we have to match the right person to the right type of unit.",67,,
499,0.97,3320.317,3330.86,"Last week, we opened the dock side apartments with rapid Ackwigz funds, targeting that for state dollars on that.",67,,
500,0.97,3330.86,3333.763,That is not permanent supportive housing.,67,,
501,0.97,3333.763,3335.065,That is permanent housing with supports.,67,,
502,0.97,3335.065,3343.073,The building is a market rate building that was purchased before it got its certificate of occupation.,67,,
503,0.97,3343.073,3356.186,So there will be homeless housing provided there but it is not--it is for those who are probably lower Acuity than others you may see out and about.,67,,
504,0.97,3356.186,3361.424,So it is making sure that you match the right people with the right places.,67,,
505,0.97,3361.424,3368.531,"Otherwise, we are going to to be stuck in the same place.",67,,
506,0.97,3368.531,3373.269,It is really building on that relationship that we have.,67,,
507,0.97,3373.269,3379.376,I am not as knowledgeable about homeless housing as mark domes is.,67,,
508,0.97,3379.376,3392.589,Or some of my staff who have worked with that segment of the housing world as well as the people that are involved in the coalition to end homelessness.,67,,
509,0.97,3392.589,3402.966,"For me, part of it is the learning and part of it is learning to work together as a team as a new governmental entity.",67,,
510,0.97,3402.966,3403.633,Thank you.,68,,
511,0.97,3403.633,3408.738,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen and director Winkler-Chin.",69,,
512,0.97,3408.738,3411.775,"Councilmember Nelson, please go ahead.",69,,

514,0.97,3412.809,3417.647,Just come a little closer to the microphone.,71,,
515,0.97,3417.647,3418.982,Pull it close.,71,,
516,0.97,3418.982,3419.816,There we go.,71,,
517,0.97,3419.816,3420.517,"Perfect, thank you.",71,,
518,0.97,3420.517,3423.953,Councilmember Pedersen asked one of my questions so I will pass.,72,,
519,0.97,3423.953,3438.835,And then I do have a question about permanent rental assistance as a support that I have just become aware of but I can have an Email exchange rather than taking up this time to talk about that.,72,,
520,0.97,3438.835,3444.04,"Okay, thank you so much, Councilmember Nelson.",73,,
521,0.97,3444.04,3452.382,"Director Winkler-Chin, anything off the top of your head on that topic or Doyou want to do a follow-up on it?",73,,
522,0.97,3452.382,3453.116,"Okay, no problem.",73,,
523,0.97,3453.116,3459.155,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Nelson and feel free to copy us.",73,,
524,0.97,3459.155,3462.826,"Councilmember Lewis, please go ahead.",73,,
525,0.97,3462.826,3468.097,Thank you chair Maus Cadeo.,74,,
526,0.97,3468.097,3475.939,I don't have a question but I wanted to say I will be voted in favor of the nomination.,74,,
527,0.97,3475.939,3527.223,"Councilmember Herbold and I have the privilege of hearing director Winkler-Chin give a key note to a habitat for humanity gathering a few weeks ago that was really a great opportunity to hear director Winkler-Chin expand on the critical role of working in the space with nonprofit partners, with private developers, with government agencies to come up with a mix of strategies that are essential to make progress on the housing crisis and how it INTERSECTS with the homelessness crisis and the related challenges we are facing with the city, having adequate work force housing, and support assistance for Renters.",74,,
528,0.97,3527.223,3542.272,I was really impressed with director Winkler-Chin's address and having more opportunities to avail myself of the service knowledge and dedication that she is going to bring to this job.,74,,
529,0.97,3542.272,3557.153,I just want to lift that up as we are here to vote to confirm and say I look forward to working on many projects in my district and beyond with the director.,74,,
530,0.97,3557.153,3557.954,So thank you.,74,,
531,0.97,3557.954,3561.09,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Lewis.",75,,
532,0.97,3561.09,3564.661,I will come back to Councilmember Nelson for a follow up question.,75,,
533,0.97,3564.661,3573.97,It appears that you started your comments by saying you are not an expert on affordable housing or developing affordable housing.,76,,
534,0.97,3573.97,3599.128,"What I wanted to echo is what pretty much every Speaker said in the beginning and that is when we are talking about equitable development and preventing displacement, you already have all of the experience with supporting community and also preventing the displacement of small businesses from community and supporting them.",76,,
535,0.97,3599.128,3606.936,So there is that aspect of such a strong nexus between what the office of housing will be doing and also the economic development.,76,,
536,0.97,3606.936,3612.275,I look forward to working with you on that.,76,,
537,0.97,3612.275,3615.244,And Diane said it better than I could have.,76,,
538,0.97,3615.244,3616.546,Good to hear her voice.,76,,
539,0.97,3616.546,3621.985,Thank you for your willingness to serve.,76,,
540,0.97,3621.985,3623.386,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",77,,
541,0.97,3623.386,3623.786,"Okay, colleagues.",77,,
542,0.97,3623.786,3633.029,I really want to thank all of you for your engagement in the discussion today.,77,,
543,0.97,3633.029,3639.469,"Director Winkler-Chin, really excited about all you put in the questionnaires and the answers you provided.",77,,
544,0.97,3639.469,3659.188,"As Councilmember Herbold noted, you have been on the community end, a strong advocate of some of the policies we are excited about, Afirmative marketing and with some of the policies that now in this seat as the director of the office of housing, you get a chance to forward, is made possible because of the funding that you have been a champion of on the outside as well.",77,,
545,0.97,3659.188,3678.041,"And now being a steward of the public funds, I think we have a lot of students, such as jump start, the Affordability funding coming in, the local sales tax authorizing the city, using a portion of sales tax for affordable housing.",77,,
546,0.97,3678.041,3694.257,"We will begin to scale the investments for affordable housing to meet more of the need we see growing in the community, going from just $44 million total investment in affordable housing in 2016 to now being able to put forward $200 million in last year's budget.",77,,
547,0.97,3694.257,3709.739,"We know much more is soon to come with our investments, moving forward from jump start and the opportunity with you at the helm and partnership with Council to increase the affordable housing levy that will be in front of voters next year.",77,,
548,0.97,3709.739,3733.129,"Anything you would like to say in conclusion as you reflect on the opportunity to Advns some of the progressive policies you have been able to champion on the outside and now being on the inside, the priorities in the near term to put the dollars into action as we move forward on this confirmation?",77,,
549,0.97,3733.129,3733.296,.,78,,
550,0.97,3733.296,3738.334,I would say the mix of dollars helps with the policies created.,79,,
551,0.97,3738.334,3744.64,There is a level of flexibility there that the office of housing has not had 10 to 15 years ago.,79,,
552,0.97,3744.64,3750.48,So I feel that the moment is right.,79,,
553,0.97,3750.48,3768.598,"With all of the things we have been working on through the past years, and learning how we can better support community, and the types of projects we should invest in and what are the other Infrastructural needs to improve on, I feel very lucky.",79,,
554,0.97,3768.598,3770.867,"Let's be honest, the work will be tough.",79,,
555,0.97,3770.867,3780.376,I feel really lucky for you to be considering this confirmation and for me being able to sit in this seat right now.,79,,
556,0.97,3780.376,3780.91,Thank you for that.,79,,
557,0.97,3780.91,3788.017,"With that, I don't see any additional questions from my colleagues.",80,,
558,0.97,3788.017,3796.159,I'm excited to move the committee recommend the confirmation of the appointment of Maiko Winkler-Chin as the director of the office of housing.,80,,
559,0.97,3796.159,3797.56,Is there a second?,80,,

565,0.97,3824.32,3829.392,[roll being called].,82,,

611,0.97,4055.985,4060.523,The first segment will highlight the ways the office of housing is addressing equity issues.,96,,
612,0.97,4060.523,4065.361,Then we will talk about the demographics of the communities we serve.,96,,
613,0.97,4065.361,4080.042,"And then we will look at the investments in affordable housing, followed by an update on policy and program and Lastly we will finish up by sharing what O.H.",96,,
614,0.97,4080.042,4082.678,Is doing to build organizational capacity in the community.,96,,
615,0.97,4082.678,4089.618,"At the end of the presentation, there will be time for questions.",96,,
616,0.97,4089.618,4111.24,Racism and discriminatory policies and investment patterns in the housing market as well as historical systemic Disinvestment in communities of color by government have produced an ongoing pattern of inequity and disproportionately burdened communities.,97,,
617,0.97,4111.24,4111.407,O.H.,97,,
618,0.97,4111.407,4114.276,Seeks to address this in a few ways.,97,,
619,0.97,4114.276,4120.049,One is the way in which we invest in affordable rental and home ownership.,97,,
620,0.97,4120.049,4128.39,What this looks like is Partnershipses O.H.,97,,
621,0.97,4128.39,4135.965,Has with community based organizations providing technical assistance to help them achieve the goals of their organization.,97,,
622,0.97,4135.965,4141.136,Another way is through our affordable housing policies and programs.,97,,
623,0.97,4141.136,4148.711,An example of this is our community reference program.,97,,
624,0.97,4148.711,4154.316,"Lastly, but not least, supporting organizations rooted in communities.",97,,
625,0.97,4154.316,4167.496,An example is writing Predevelopment Fupding Forrome ownership sponsored by community based organizations with experience worked with historically marginalized communities.,97,,
626,0.97,4167.496,4168.364,Charles will share some demographics.,97,,
627,0.97,4168.364,4168.697,Thank you.,98,,
628,0.97,4168.697,4177.973,I think it is important for us to take a step back and identify who lives in O.H.,98,,
629,0.97,4177.973,4178.24,Housing.,98,,
630,0.97,4178.24,4185.147,60% of the rental housing are Bipock.,98,,
631,0.97,4185.147,4185.981,30% are low income.,98,,
632,0.97,4185.981,4190.719,42% of those are special needs households.,98,,
633,0.97,4190.719,4194.823,I should point out that █30% of A.M.I.,98,,
634,0.97,4194.823,4204.366,"Is roughly $27,000 for a single individual or $38,000 for a family of four.",98,,
635,0.97,4204.366,4209.004,We want to highlight the home ownership programs.,98,,
636,0.97,4209.004,4225.854,45% of home owners receiving home buyers assistance are Bipoc households and 38% in the program are 30% AMI households.,98,,
637,0.97,4225.854,4237.199,"If we look at the larger demographics of Seattle, 55% are white, 10% are Hispanic.",98,,
638,0.97,4237.199,4245.541,"For home owners, 40% are Bipock, 42% are white and 4% are Hispanic.",98,,
639,0.97,4245.541,4264.66,"As you transition, Seattle Channel, if you could pin the person speaking so that the projection shows the Speaker, that would be fantastic.",99,,
640,0.97,4264.66,4266.095,Right now Councilmember is pinned.,99,,
641,0.97,4266.095,4272.768,I want the speakers have a chance to have their presentation broadcast.,99,,
642,0.97,4272.768,4273.068,All right.,99,,
643,0.97,4273.068,4273.369,Thank you.,99,,
644,0.97,4273.369,4276.672,"Charles, now I see you as pinned.",99,,
645,0.97,4276.672,4277.406,Please go ahead.,99,,
646,0.97,4277.406,4283.112,So now we have talked about the demographic data.,100,,
647,0.97,4283.112,4288.384,I think we should highlight some of what the organization is funding.,100,,
648,0.97,4288.384,4300.863,"If we look at the rental program for the 2021 notice of funding availability, we funded 15 different rental new development projects.",100,,
649,0.97,4300.863,4309.238,"Of those projects, six of them went to Bipoc or Bipoc led organizations, about 40% of the projects.",100,,
650,0.97,4309.238,4322.017,"I will note that is up from our 2020 funding round, about 25% of Bipoc organizations.",100,,
651,0.97,4322.017,4342.371,"The rap odd acquisition program mentioned today, we have funded six newly constructed projects of those, all went to Bypoc led organizations.",100,,
652,0.97,4342.371,4346.975,Next slide?,100,,
653,0.97,4346.975,4364.46,"So furthering highlighting examples of what the investments look like when we work with Bipoc and Bipoc led organizations, in the rental program, we recently funded the Latinx community building 87 homes in Columbia city.",100,,

814,0.97,5412.106,5414.375,I will pass it to Jeannette.,118,,
815,0.97,5414.375,5416.577,Thanks.,119,,
816,0.97,5416.577,5420.915,"Jeannette Blankenship, deputy director in the budget office.",119,,
817,0.97,5420.915,5426.621,I will pass it to Miguel.,119,,
818,0.97,5426.621,5438.332,"Good afternoon, Councilmembers, I'm a fiscal policy analyst in the budget office I am the change team Cochair.",120,,
819,0.97,5438.332,5442.87,"William Chen, fiscal policy manager for the city budget office.",121,,
820,0.97,5442.87,5445.94,"Great, thank you so much.",122,,
821,0.97,5445.94,5447.041,It is also exciting.,122,,
822,0.97,5447.041,5449.177,"Typically Councilmembers, you hear from just me.",122,,
823,0.97,5449.177,5454.248,It is so exciting that we have my team members here today to share this work.,122,,
824,0.97,5454.248,5458.052,So today we are going to walk you through several items.,122,,
825,0.97,5458.052,5461.989,"If we can go to the next slide, please?",122,,
826,0.97,5461.989,5469.33,We will start out with grounding Anti-Racing principles and truths we keep top of mind as we enter through the work.,122,,
827,0.97,5469.33,5491.252,"We will walk you through race and social budget changes, the overall process changes we have implemented, some internal changes we have worked on, internal to CBO, our newly formed change team and the change team's work plan that was just getting a big stamp of approval in the last month.",122,,
828,0.97,5491.252,5502.463,"And RSGI and we have a craft rubric that has been in collaboration with Oscr, it is a product of the collaboration.",122,,
829,0.97,5502.463,5506.467,We will talk you through those elements as well.,122,,
830,0.97,5506.467,5518.713,"First, if we go to the next slide, just some Groundings in the Anti-Racism truths that we discuss with the Department Finance managers.",123,,
831,0.97,5518.713,5520.948,These are where the ideas show up for us.,123,,
832,0.97,5520.948,5525.052,"The two that we wanted to highlight, one is gate keeping.",123,,
833,0.97,5525.052,5543.638,This is persons who work in institutions that often function as gate keepers to ensure that institutions perpetuate itself with networking with those who share those values and maintaining accountability in the community.,123,,
834,0.97,5543.638,5546.307,The gate keeper becomes an Nugzal.,123,,
835,0.97,5546.307,5553.981,"How do we show up in this space and make sure we are letting in, like, we are not being an inappropriate gate keeper?",123,,
836,0.97,5553.981,5562.657,And then truth number four that shows up here as part of something that came out of OCR is that we are all part of this picture.,123,,
837,0.97,5562.657,5569.43,None of us asked for this but we all have roles to play.,123,,
838,0.97,5569.43,5571.899,The full length is developed by OCR are linked here as well.,123,,
839,0.97,5571.899,5584.278,"If is not possible to live in the United States and not experience the impacts of colonial racism and other forms of oppression, advantage or disadvantage on our lives.",123,,
840,0.97,5584.278,5597.725,None of us are responsible for the past but all of us are responsible for the present and to some extent for the future.,123,,
841,0.97,5597.725,5605.9,"So with that, you can go on to the next slide.",124,,
842,0.97,5605.9,5609.604,And I will pass it over to Rhoda.,124,,
843,0.97,5609.604,5623.484,"To give you an over view of how the budget office center, we asked partners to submit an assessment 06 equity impacts with any budget request.",125,,
844,0.97,5623.484,5627.021,What you see on the slide is what they respond.,125,,
845,0.97,5627.021,5631.225,How does a budget impact racial equity?,125,,
846,0.97,5631.225,5633.694,Is it Impacting Historially Dised Vantaged communities?,125,,
847,0.97,5633.694,5636.297,Does it have negative racial justice impacts?,125,,
848,0.97,5636.297,5640.234,"If so, what are some things you considered to mitigate that?",125,,
849,0.97,5640.234,5645.74,It also touches on language access needs.,125,,
850,0.97,5645.74,5650.578,Is the proposal incorporating--does it have a language access plan component to it?,125,,
851,0.97,5650.578,5665.86,"And I think it is important to ask these questions for many reasons but it is especially a great opportunity for departments to reflect on how they are engaging with equity, how they are engaging with disadvantaged communities in the city.",125,,
852,0.97,5665.86,5685.312,"It also gives the budget office an opportunity to be clear in our commitment in centering equity in the review and analysis process, so each budget proposal.",125,,
853,0.97,5685.312,5687.114,So these kinds of questions are have a double effect.,125,,
854,0.97,5687.114,5702.563,It is a reflection for our Department and it is great information for us to have in the deliberation process as we prove those budget asks or requests.,125,,
855,0.97,5702.563,5706.167,Go to the next slide.,125,,
856,0.97,5706.167,5712.606,Another point of equity and inclusion is the way the budget process is Crafted within departments.,125,,
857,0.97,5712.606,5720.281,Historically the budget process has been a closed off one where senior level staff are involved in the crafting process.,125,,
858,0.97,5720.281,5723.484,That RAISES a lot of equity concerns.,125,,
859,0.97,5723.484,5731.559,"So the budget office, we have been thinking about what our role is in making the budget process more transparent.",125,,
860,0.97,5731.559,5747.208,"What is our role in reducing the barriers for city staff at all levels, to have access to the process and be more Tajable about what is included.",125,,
861,0.97,5747.208,5766.26,"One way that we take action on that is to encourage the Department Finance teams, to include Ecwale leads within the Department and change team members in the budget crafting process.",125,,
862,0.97,5766.26,5773.968,And one way we facilitated that was to create a tool where they can assess the transparency.,125,,
863,0.97,5773.968,5776.203,We will cover that later.,125,,
864,0.97,5776.203,5786.547,We have been actively thinking about what we could do to run a more transparent process.,125,,
865,0.97,5786.547,5789.216,And a more equitable one.,125,,
866,0.97,5789.216,5795.823,"We have been engaging to see what their needs are, what levels of support they need to make that happen.",125,,
867,0.97,5795.823,5805.699,It is definitely an ongoing conversation where we receive feedback and incorporate it into any changes we make.,125,,
868,0.97,5805.699,5809.603,That's just a look at the budget process.,125,,
869,0.97,5809.603,5811.338,Cbo has been working on internal changes.,125,,
870,0.97,5811.338,5818.312,I will pass it on to William to cover that.,125,,
871,0.97,5818.312,5820.247,.,126,,
872,0.97,5820.247,5820.915,Thanks.,127,,
873,0.97,5820.915,5824.852,We have also made internally focused changes for CBO.,127,,
874,0.97,5824.852,5828.722,"First on that, we established a new CBO change team.",127,,
875,0.97,5828.722,5834.295,That was starting the focus on the equity issues that are directly in CBO this year.,127,,
876,0.97,5834.295,5844.905,We adopted a change team charter to give our new team the structure to continue working over time.,127,,
877,0.97,5844.905,5849.376,"We elected Cochairs, Miguel, who you have already met.",127,,
878,0.97,5849.376,5852.279,And we had Cochairs for each Department.,127,,
879,0.97,5852.279,5860.487,We created an annual work plan with discussion with staff to direct our energies and increase engagement of staff on our priorities.,127,,
880,0.97,5860.487,5867.795,"Now, we also took a critical look at our hiring procedures.",127,,
881,0.97,5867.795,5870.965,We updated our job postings to remove barriers.,127,,
882,0.97,5870.965,5882.61,"We revised the language and criteria to focus on talent and alignment with our mission, rather than looking at previous experience and educational background.",127,,
883,0.97,5882.61,5902.196,Cbo promotes more actively to in the represented potential Abknts by reaching out Hbcu's or schools with high Latinx populations and it has resulted in a more diverse staff and experiences that they Pring to the table.,127,,
884,0.97,5902.196,5909.003,"On the next slide, I will pass it over to Miguel.",127,,
885,0.97,5909.003,5910.471,"Thanks, William.",128,,
886,0.97,5910.471,5913.107,It is a relatively new change team.,128,,
887,0.97,5913.107,5919.079,As part of my role as Cochair and Rhoda is the other Cochair.,128,,
888,0.97,5919.079,5922.516,We have attempted to establish a unique culture for what fits our Department.,128,,
889,0.97,5922.516,5924.685,I will go a little out of order.,128,,
890,0.97,5924.685,5946.674,"First for us, it has been important for us to recognize the historical effort that our coworkers have been engaged in decades now in organizing the teams, divisions, and departments in this work and elevating issues that will impact race and social justice within the city and for the city residents.",128,,
891,0.97,5946.674,5947.308,So we acknowledge that work.,128,,
892,0.97,5947.308,5960.921,And we recognize that we are new to the space and we are here to build off of all of the effort that has come before us and all of the leaders that have come before us with deep gratitude.,128,,
893,0.97,5960.921,5966.827,"For our Department, we are established in a strict process, the budget process.",128,,
894,0.97,5966.827,5997.458,"We have been building a culture of experimentation, one way our colleagues can bring new ideas to the table, we can discuss them together, one where we can listen to finance managers, directors, staff members from across staff departments in the city to hear what their thoughts are and receive their feedback and build these new ideas into how we can change these internal processes in ways that impact equity in measurable outcomes.",128,,
895,0.97,5997.458,6017.144,"And finally, we recognize that our role in this process is really aligned with being the stewards of the city's resources here and our ability to bring an equitable analysis into the conversation is one of our chief responsibilities.",128,,
896,0.97,6017.144,6042.269,So we discussed that and impressed on that with our colleagues and tried to figure out how we are sharpening the own ability to understand the work so we can deepen the city's equitable outcomes both across the internal instruction as well as externally for all of our residents.,128,,
897,0.97,6042.269,6042.569,Next slide?,128,,
898,0.97,6042.569,6053.046,"Over the span of several months, our change team met to discuss what our work priorities are.",129,,
899,0.97,6053.046,6058.018,We have identified throw areas that were actively working on.,129,,
900,0.97,6058.018,6064.224,The first is creating or establishing an internal equity forum.,129,,
901,0.97,6064.224,6073.2,The idea here is to create a system of Wholistic analysis that we can use in the budget process.,129,,
902,0.97,6073.2,6085.045,Our main goal is to kind of have a Wholistic analysis at the beginning stages of the budget review process.,129,,
903,0.97,6085.045,6092.653,So currently budget analysts focus on specific Department portfolios and make recommendations accordingly.,129,,
904,0.97,6092.653,6101.595,I think the hope is to have a Wholistic view at the beginning stages where the analysts have an over view of the city wide asks.,129,,
905,0.97,6101.595,6103.897,That is the first item.,129,,
906,0.97,6103.897,6105.399,The first is identifying equity indicators.,129,,
907,0.97,6105.399,6114.041,I think the goal here is we want to be able to answer the question of how do we know we are doing an equitable job within the city?,129,,
908,0.97,6114.041,6118.645,And how are we measuring our progress?,129,,
909,0.97,6118.645,6143.036,There have been a lot of ongoing efforts in the city to standardize data collection on demographics and the Innovaion performance teams in the budget office are working with various departments to help departments create a way of standardized way of collecting that data.,129,,
910,0.97,6143.036,6154.281,So that same team is helping us craft tools that they can use in our analysis.,129,,
911,0.97,6154.281,6162.422,So we have a way of measuring equity.,129,,
912,0.97,6162.422,6173.734,And then the third item is working on what is the Eial I guess rubric.,129,,
913,0.97,6173.734,6184.711,"In collaboration with OCR, worked on a tool that departments used to assess their transparency level, their level of transparency within their Department internally.",129,,
914,0.97,6184.711,6201.028,"You know, this specific item is working on I enhancing the tool with feedback we received at the end of last year.",129,,
915,0.97,6201.028,6201.795,Those are the three main items.,129,,
916,0.97,6201.795,6209.937,I will turn it over to Jeannette to cover the rubric.,129,,
917,0.97,6209.937,6214.374,I will share more about the budget and what it is.,130,,
918,0.97,6214.374,6226.853,"After we receive the Department input in the summer of 2021, last year, the budget office and race and social justice team at OCR Debriefed together these responses.",130,,
919,0.97,6226.853,6236.53,"We want to understand where the departments are and what resources will be helpful in understanding, what does progress look like?",130,,
920,0.97,6236.53,6237.631,How can we better define this?,130,,
921,0.97,6237.631,6248.875,The race and social justice team and office of civil rights developed a rubric inspired on becoming an Anti-Racist Multicultural organization.,130,,
922,0.97,6248.875,6265.158,It was adapted for budgeting purposes to consider Resrs allocation ranging from a closed process where just a few decision makers are engaged to a more Transformational process.,130,,
923,0.97,6265.158,6269.596,The rubric was developed by partners to guide conversations.,130,,
924,0.97,6269.596,6270.664,Who is asking the question?,130,,
925,0.97,6270.664,6280.574,Thinking about how we engage the race and social justice advocates like change teams in the city as well as Department leadership and finance teams in the budget office.,130,,
926,0.97,6280.574,6293.387,"In this year's budget development process, as we look ahead to 2023 and 2024, the budget office asked the Department to provide feedback on how it was applied.",130,,
927,0.97,6293.387,6295.756,How it can be made clear.,130,,
928,0.97,6295.756,6299.926,It recognizes different departments at different places when that request is made.,130,,
929,0.97,6299.926,6303.397,I think the most important thing is this is not a solution of itself.,130,,
930,0.97,6303.397,6306.333,It is a framework to have the conversations.,130,,
931,0.97,6306.333,6317.411,We will continue to build on the progress of the past to have an Antiracist approach for how we think of the city's resource allocation.,130,,
932,0.97,6317.411,6325.185,We want to continue to redefine the resource to meet departments where they are at and define where departments are at.,130,,
933,0.97,6325.185,6328.121,I will go to the next slide.,130,,
934,0.97,6328.121,6337.831,So we want to close this time by recognizing the deep partnership that this work requires.,131,,
935,0.97,6337.831,6344.404,"Really given the Teal's role with the city, this is how we partner to push for progress.",131,,
936,0.97,6344.404,6348.175,I want to highlight the Partsureships that have helped advance.,131,,
937,0.97,6348.175,6359.119,The very last meeting that the budget office had before anyone at home in March of 2020 was a training for the budget office with the Department of civil rights.,131,,
938,0.97,6359.119,6371.098,"Since that time, since we said this is the last time we are in person, and throughout the pandemic, we have continued to partner.",131,,
939,0.97,6371.098,6379.005,We are providing more context for the work and train on Anti-Racism and shared truths that we opened with.,131,,
940,0.97,6379.005,6381.375,We held feedback sessions with the departments.,131,,
941,0.97,6381.375,6394.121,We were able to provide a training for the summit in January Whichou Cr said was one of the highest attended presentations at that summit.,131,,
942,0.97,6394.121,6414.775,"We partnered with the action committee to develop a tool and develop questions for departments to consider these questions during budget development, thinking about how they approach engagement, how they hear from community, how they thought about Limpy investments.",131,,
943,0.97,6414.775,6422.616,They asked to engage with the Coleads and other advocates to take on a larger role in budget.,131,,
944,0.97,6422.616,6430.891,"Building these relationships which traditionally have not been strong in some departments, especially when we are working remotely takes time.",131,,
945,0.97,6430.891,6435.962,Our goal is really that we are deepening the relationships.,131,,
946,0.97,6435.962,6439.366,Starting where we are at and building from there.,131,,
947,0.97,6439.366,6445.272,The questions from last year's budget process were analyzed and used to inform the draft rubric.,131,,
948,0.97,6445.272,6449.843,"Finally, I want to note that the city budget office team, this is ongoing work.",131,,
949,0.97,6449.843,6455.382,We have a broad team that supports those you are hearing from today.,131,,
950,0.97,6455.382,6462.022,We are meeting Biweekly with the office of civil rights to deepen the relationships and advance the collective progress.,131,,
951,0.97,6462.022,6481.208,"And finally, before I close, I really want to Thapg Kelly O'Brien, Immod AB Rumam, and Jason Eastman among others for their partnerships over the last few years to help support and advance our progress.",131,,
952,0.97,6481.208,6489.683,Next slide and we will open it up for questions.,131,,
953,0.97,6489.683,6489.95,Thank you.,131,,
954,0.97,6489.95,6496.223,Wonderful.,132,,
955,0.97,6496.223,6500.093,I want to thank you for the presentation today.,132,,
956,0.97,6500.093,6506.399,I want to make sure folks can hear us okay.,132,,
957,0.97,6506.399,6507.067,My screen appears frozen.,132,,
958,0.97,6507.067,6513.607,If you are still on there--I see Jeannette smiling.,132,,
959,0.97,6513.607,6515.342,Thanks to everyone who presented today.,132,,
960,0.97,6515.342,6529.756,Thanks to the entire team because there are more folks who made this work possible.,132,,
961,0.97,6529.756,6530.557,Please pass on the appreciation.,132,,
962,0.97,6530.557,6538.899,We are excited about the leadership and making this a routine practice to have the city's office present.,132,,
963,0.97,6538.899,6546.039,Are there any questions or comments for the Rsji change team?,132,,
964,0.97,6546.039,6550.243,Thank you so much.,133,,
965,0.97,6550.243,6550.71,Really quick question.,133,,
966,0.97,6550.71,6565.025,"One of the slides, you wrote of a system of Wholistic analysis for budget, is that the rubric you developed and asked the departments to use?",133,,
967,0.97,6565.025,6572.299,Is that what you are referring Tothere?,133,,
968,0.97,6572.299,6573.166,I'll take this.,134,,
969,0.97,6573.166,6573.433,Thank you.,134,,
970,0.97,6573.433,6578.572,Those are two different aspects of the work plan we are focused on.,134,,
971,0.97,6578.572,6584.511,The internal forum we are discussing is something we do on a regular basis.,134,,
972,0.97,6584.511,6588.481,We must consider the process Wholistically.,134,,
973,0.97,6588.481,6593.353,We look at the individual departments within our portfolios.,134,,
974,0.97,6593.353,6594.22,That creates a Siloed approach.,134,,
975,0.97,6594.22,6614.641,"Our goal is to build a secondary forum for analysts to do cross cutting work, to look at issues that impact various departments and think more equitably to think about the budget process Wholistically and not just focus on the departments in the portfolio.",134,,
976,0.97,6614.641,6626.686,The rubric we went into detail on is an opportunity to support departments across the city as they develop the budget on their side before they get to.,134,,
977,0.97,6626.686,6631.324,"Before they build the budget, it has been a closed process.",134,,
978,0.97,6631.324,6633.059,We don't believe that creates equitable outcomes.,134,,
979,0.97,6633.059,6643.37,We are working with those departments and being advised by OCR on how to build a more transparent budget from the Department level.,134,,
980,0.97,6643.37,6649.909,The rubric is a tool to measure where departments are and what their Longterm goals will be for the future.,134,,
981,0.97,6649.909,6661.554,And then to be a starting point for a conversation on a starting point of what do we need to do to get the departments to their goals?,134,,
982,0.97,6661.554,6670.73,"Just support, information, knowledge, education, what can we do as partners to build a more transparent process.",134,,
983,0.97,6670.73,6675.802,That is helpful.,135,,
984,0.97,6675.802,6684.644,I think it emphasizes the potential transformation under this particular Department and with the work you are doing.,135,,
985,0.97,6684.644,6711.404,"Because you touch the work of every Department in the city with the budget process and with your shepherding of the Department's needs and as it Reerates to the external piece, you are working with residents in the city who have different needs from different departments in the city as well.",135,,
986,0.97,6711.404,6725.952,"So there is again, a lot of power and a lot of potential for transfer of information with the work you are doing so really appreciate it.",135,,
987,0.97,6725.952,6729.456,Any additional comments or questions?,136,,
988,0.97,6729.456,6729.722,Okay.,137,,
989,0.97,6729.722,6737.33,"Any additional closing comments from you, director Dingley or anyone from the Rsj I-Team?",137,,
990,0.97,6737.33,6742.502,I just want to Ecco the partners that helped get us where we are today.,138,,
991,0.97,6742.502,6748.408,There are many people who took a lot of time to educate us as a team.,138,,
992,0.97,6748.408,6752.746,"We are in Debted to that, the time they gave us to us.",138,,
993,0.97,6752.746,6753.546,We are so excite.,138,,
994,0.97,6753.546,6761.154,"The team in front of you, the CBO change team is sort of a misnomer because it is the whole office.",138,,
995,0.97,6761.154,6768.328,It really has been an incredible experience to see it come together and play a role in it.,138,,
996,0.97,6768.328,6772.999,I'm deeply proud to be here and excited about the work.,138,,
997,0.97,6772.999,6781.875,And grateful for the opportunity to share the progress we have made.,138,,
998,0.97,6781.875,6783.51,Any thing else you would like to add?,138,,
999,0.97,6783.51,6794.354,I just want to thank you for the time and opportunity to lift up the great work that my colleagues have been doing.,139,,
1000,0.97,6794.354,6797.223,"Excellent, excellent.",140,,

1002,0.97,6800.593,6813.239,"We will continue to get updates from the change team and from all of you if you ever feel you want to reach out on anything, we are available.",140,,
1003,0.97,6813.239,6820.18,Our office is on all budget related issues and we are happy to engage with you in committee or at any point.,140,,
1004,0.97,6820.18,6822.015,Just let us know.,140,,
1005,0.97,6822.015,6831.591,"Thank you so much, director Dingley and thank you for joining us today for this inaugural Rsji change team.",140,,
1006,0.97,6831.591,6834.861,We are at the end of our agenda today.,140,,
1007,0.97,6834.861,6842.468,I mentioned that our intent is to stick with our first and third Wednesday meetings of the month at 9:30 A.M ..,140,,
1008,0.97,6842.468,6846.005,And again that is next Wednesday at 9:30.,140,,
1009,0.97,6846.005,6859.085,"At that time, we will have the jump start community driven housing fund discussion, the lease legislation and the Hsd stand alone grants ordinances.",140,,
1010,0.97,6859.085,6876.302,"For the good of the order, I will be asking the Council President to allow for us to waive the rules next Tuesday to allow the director of housing nomination to be considered next Tuesday on the afternoon.",140,,
1011,0.97,6876.302,6881.507,So that will be the parliamentary motion so we can consider her on Tuesday next week.,140,,
1012,0.97,6881.507,6884.377,"Colleagues, it is really good to see you.",140,,
1013,0.97,6884.377,6889.716,Thank you for everything.,140,,
