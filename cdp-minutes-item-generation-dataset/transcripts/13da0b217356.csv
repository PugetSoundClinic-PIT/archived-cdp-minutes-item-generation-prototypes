103,0.97,898.898,966.799,I have a concern as a long time Seattle resident that I can't get anyone to look at all along the roadways like Washington Boulevard West Lake smaller parks and trees losing thousands of trees and it's being addressed in places like Lincoln park and it's not being addressed on our roadways and I think we're going to turn around and go where do all of those trees go and I don't know if I think there are many places that nobody could be bothered to notice that there's Invasive Ivy just killing them and I'm going to send all of you guys some pictures in case you haven't noticed and honestly the environmental organization like the woman who just spoke I can't get them to notice that or talk about it and I'm glad they're dealing with development but somebody needs to deal with the trees we're used to seeing every day that won't be there and are falling all along roads all over Seattle so that's all I have to say.,29,,
104,0.97,966.799,968.367,Thank you.,29,,

125,0.97,1035.768,1040.572,Thank you.,38,,
126,0.97,1040.572,1059.625,Resolution 31970 for Docketing two I have submitted seven amendments and of course I want them all docketed but two in particular I think are urgent and are Negligentfully analyzed by the central staff in both cases to become available.,38,,
127,0.97,1059.625,1069.868,In the case of the open government amendment it is not even accurately described in this resolution.,38,,
128,0.97,1069.868,1075.641,Please don't act on this resolution today especially under Coronavirus.,38,,
129,0.97,1075.641,1127.426,You need to give more time because it's been very difficult for the public to follow this and what this calls for is for a plan plan for open government and the Coronavirus prices shows why we need that and there's inconsistency across different agencies and there's no advance planning one of your other and that's during some one off planning action which should have been planned and coordinated with other ways of doing it across the city so please sending you E-mail and the other Council sending you members yesterday.,38,,
130,0.97,1127.426,1131.697,Second the extra heavy are damaging the roads and use.,38,,
131,0.97,1131.697,1158.524,And what is new here is that the West Seattle bridge has been found and s DOT has acknowledged that extra heavy transit classes contributed to that to say desperately needs to realize one is in the hole and the first step is just stop digging in that whole.,38,,
132,0.97,1158.524,1179.645,The city council needs to take that step because city vehicles and fire engines are damaging roads and bridges and much more damages caused by Metro granted without any action.,38,,
133,0.97,1179.645,1205.304,City to try to encourage Metro to have buses that don't do damage for roads and bridges so both of these are into the subsequently analyzed by the central staff and the city council needs to include them for the docketed study so there is reasonable discussion about what to do.,38,,
134,0.97,1205.304,1210.075,It's just two in one case and the other have to be.,38,,
135,0.97,1210.075,1210.509,I'm sorry.,39,,
136,0.97,1210.509,1212.311,They wanted to do that.,40,,

141,0.97,1246.945,1250.983,Hello I think I'm here.,42,,
142,0.97,1250.983,1253.819,You are indeed.,43,,
143,0.97,1253.819,1254.786,Good morning.,43,,
144,0.97,1254.786,1261.927,You always have to remember to pause before your frantically hit Star six a second third and fourth time.,44,,
145,0.97,1261.927,1268.734,My name is Deb Barker speaking today Council bill.,44,,
146,0.97,1268.734,1270.736,I support design review.,44,,
147,0.97,1270.736,1281.647,I was a board member for four years South West design review board and continue to attend design review board meetings in person and virtually.,44,,
148,0.97,1281.647,1295.36,I want to speak to in person design review that is critical and it is--it should be looked at--I look at it as a positive experience for the project and for the community.,44,,
149,0.97,1295.36,1315.48,It's when people go in and they have concerns and they can actually talk to somebody so I have supported design review in person and including design review for low income projects for affordable housing projects you get community support by having face-to-face conversations.,44,,
150,0.97,1315.48,1346.311,I just want to sight a business person in my community who attended a virtual design review board meeting and spent the majority of her time listening and then trying to comment and by the time in raising our hands which is always a fun to try to figure out and by the time she had figured out how to raise your hand and Unmute she was cutoff and did not make her comments which were incredibly applicable to this project so virtual is great.,44,,
151,0.97,1346.311,1356.621,It's what we do now but when we are done with virtual everybody deserves design review board meetings.,44,,
152,0.97,1356.621,1371.036,Thank you so much and I can't get back to support it I do support the bridge amendment for the comprehensive residence inclusion so thank you.,44,,
153,0.97,1371.036,1371.503,Thanks Deb.,45,,

161,0.97,1391.256,1391.49,Hi.,47,,
162,0.97,1391.49,1392.324,"This is--hello, Steve.",47,,
163,0.97,1392.324,1398.363,Good morning.,47,,
164,0.97,1398.363,1410.776,I'm speaking as chair supportive resolution 31970 supporting amending Seattle's 2535 comprehensive plan to identify opportunity better support the urban tree canopy.,47,,
165,0.97,1410.776,1422.921,"We also support the provision to consider impact the amendments to public owned parks, open space and recreation facilities and school facilities long overdue.",47,,
166,0.97,1422.921,1444.843,A couple Rougeses on the comprehensive plan amendments we ask that the provision of no Net loss of tree canopy which is the previous comprehensive plan we added that to the current plan Seattle urban forestry Commission in 2018 urged that this be added back as part of Seattle's key regulations.,47,,

199,0.97,1753.351,1776.007,The first amendment would add a new session making findings related to the Covid-19 pandemic to support procedural emergency from the act review and that exemption is specific to the on going exemption from design review for Accordable housing projects.,57,,

201,0.97,1791.356,1793.024,That amendment would also add.,57,,
202,0.97,1793.024,1803.401,And then another amendment proposed by Council member Strauss which would shorten the period of time during which Council bill 119-8767 if it passes would be in effect.,57,,
203,0.97,1803.401,1818.516,So most of of the provisions expire on an identifiable date but an uncertain date as 180 days since the Covid-19 civil emergency.,57,,
204,0.97,1818.516,1827.926,Council member Strauss' amendment would shorten that time period from 180 days to 60 days.,57,,

254,0.97,2066.097,2079.544,I want to thank the Department of construction inspection and Department of neighborhood as well as Seattle city council for their thoughtful approach for permitting during this challenging time and for following the the virtual meeting.,70,,
255,0.97,2079.544,2110.842,"We know that city wide there's nearly $15 billion of development currently deer review by the city and investment to the local and state committee as well as the potential to sustain tens of thousands of direct jobs in the construction industry and city tax revenue during this difficult economic time and efficient permitting system is important to deliver on the affordable market housing and downtown there are 35,000 residential units in planning or development and will be completing this year.",70,,
256,0.97,2110.842,2119.65,We support virtual board meetings as a way to keep projects moving and enough through project delivery.,70,,

261,0.97,2138.069,2138.903,I see you are here.,71,,
262,0.97,2138.903,2141.539,"If you are ready, take it away.",71,,
263,0.97,2141.539,2142.406,"Oh sorry, thanks.",72,,
264,0.97,2142.406,2143.374,I was on mute.,72,,
265,0.97,2143.374,2144.175,Hi there.,72,,
266,0.97,2144.175,2147.578,My name is Justin Allegra.,72,,
267,0.97,2147.578,2149.647,Can you hear me?,72,,
268,0.97,2149.647,2151.215,Yes we can.,73,,
269,0.97,2151.215,2151.516,Great.,74,,
270,0.97,2151.516,2155.486,I am the resident in queen Ann.,74,,
271,0.97,2155.486,2163.361,I'm calling on my own behalf but I'm also a member of the community Council and land review community Council.,74,,
272,0.97,2163.361,2217.548,I'm calling to support this ordinance 119187 and continuation of this ordinance based off the importance and I also think it's affordable housing without any delay and I stunt housing construction on a real way and a debilitating 2012 and 2017 where new units lacked demand post recession resulting in an economic Displaimtion and I think that it helps assure the virus related barriers to housing approval in the short term won't lead us to repeating our recent history when we bounce back and forward from this economic recession and I think through Slicitation is still a strong option during this moment in time.,74,,
273,0.97,2217.548,2251.382,Generally I just want to note that I think I'm frustrated by design review generally that we placed a design review burden on multi family housing that's born the burden of our city growth while dozens of my neighbors have torn down their detached homes and rebuilt them without any design consideration and I think we up hold our history of class oppression by adding these extra barriers to multi family housing and ask of our housing and single family to trust our city staff.,74,,
274,0.97,2251.382,2261.759,I support the Strauss Lewis amendment to shorten this provision and thank you all and particularly Council member Lewis over ride yesterday.,74,,
275,0.97,2261.759,2263.894,Thank you for your time today.,74,,
276,0.97,2263.894,2264.629,Thank you Justin.,75,,
277,0.97,2264.629,2275.006,Up next we have Patrick.,75,,
278,0.97,2275.006,2276.007,.,75,,
279,0.97,2276.007,2277.708,Hi can you hear me okay?,76,,
280,0.97,2277.708,2278.542,Yeah good morning.,77,,
281,0.97,2278.542,2279.11,Good morning.,78,,
282,0.97,2279.11,2281.646,Thanks for giving me the opportunity to speak.,78,,
283,0.97,2281.646,2283.014,I really appreciate it.,78,,
284,0.97,2283.014,2318.749,I'm here representing my Co- founder much my company like Union partners and I'm also a board member and just as a reminder Washington commercial real estate Association one of the 900 members and we are for the most part what we do is we care about the health of our city and county and state and as a board member and a local developer here in Seattle I'm here to testify in full support of ordinance 12602 design review.,78,,
285,0.97,2318.749,2325.956,Working closely with Sdci and many Council members since the pandemic began last spring.,78,,
286,0.97,2325.956,2342.707,And we really appreciate the willingness to work together on finding a solution that helps keep communities informed about what's happening with new projects and keep projects moving through the entitlement process in a reasonably efficient manner.,78,,
287,0.97,2342.707,2350.514,Moving to virtual meetings allows in many devices greater flexibility for public participation.,78,,
288,0.97,2350.514,2359.89,As neighbors contend from their homes instead of coming to an evening meeting I know that's very difficult for many so I think it's been actually very helpful.,78,,
289,0.97,2359.89,2371.235,The process also I think what it stream lines what has become a custom number some presentation process and I think it should help design more better review and comment on each package.,78,,
290,0.97,2371.235,2379.51,Additionally the changes to the historic preservation boards and commissions by the staff is also very effective use of their knowledge and resources.,78,,
291,0.97,2379.51,2389.22,So again we support this legislation and thanks so much for allowing me to comment today.,78,,
292,0.97,2389.22,2390.287,Thank you.,79,,
293,0.97,2390.287,2404.235,Up next is Alicia Ruiz followed by Brian and I recognize Megan Cruz that my Scrolling on the chart was incorrect so we will then hear from you.,80,,
294,0.97,2404.235,2404.835,My apologies Megan.,80,,
295,0.97,2404.835,2411.409,Up next is Alicia.,80,,

298,0.97,2413.811,2414.445,Yes we can.,82,,
299,0.97,2414.445,2414.678,Hi.,83,,
300,0.97,2414.678,2416.514,My name is Alicia Ruiz.,83,,
301,0.97,2416.514,2431.729,"I'm the Seattle of government affairs manager for the master builders Association for King and Snohomish County so I'm speaking today on behalf of our nearly 3,000 members in support of Council bill 119877.",83,,
302,0.97,2431.729,2439.003,The Mayor and city council did an amazing job initiating the original change quickly in response to Covid.,83,,
303,0.97,2439.003,2444.008,Unfortunately Covid is still a threat to our collective health in our committee.,83,,
304,0.97,2444.008,2447.678,The Council's decision makes sense then and extending it makes sense now.,83,,
305,0.97,2447.678,2480.044,If we want to move forward in more housing in areas where we planned it we need to extend the ADR ordinance today and so I just wanted to add on that it's Impairtive that we keep these projects going obviously we're in the middle of a housing crisis and you know construction is one of the few industries that is able to continue forward and keep people employed and really been the back bone of our economy locally and nationwide.,83,,
306,0.97,2480.044,2490.12,So I just wanted to express our support and I yield the rest of my time.,83,,
307,0.97,2490.12,2491.121,.,83,,
308,0.97,2491.121,2491.922,Thank you.,84,,
309,0.97,2491.922,2502.533,"Up next Brian followed by Megan Cruz, Deb Barker and Annie if you are on the listen line please follow the instructions to call into this public comment period.",84,,
310,0.97,2502.533,2506.07,This public hearing.,84,,
311,0.97,2506.07,2508.072,"Brian, good morning.",84,,
312,0.97,2508.072,2510.307,Thafng you for Resetting to this public hearing.,84,,
313,0.97,2510.307,2513.177,Good morning.,84,,
314,0.97,2513.177,2514.245,Take it away.,84,,
315,0.97,2514.245,2514.645,Thank you.,85,,
316,0.97,2514.645,2516.78,My name is Brian.,85,,
317,0.97,2516.78,2520.05,The local architect and developer in Seattle.,85,,
318,0.97,2520.05,2528.559,I'm in district 7 on queen Ann.,85,,
319,0.97,2528.559,2551.382,I'd also like to thank navigating uncertain times for us in the industry and also considering the extension of these protocols I think the front of the virtual meeting for public out reach very much allows a more broad group to participate and be informed in the projects.,85,,
320,0.97,2551.382,2558.222,So I strongly support the extension of that even beyond the Covid times.,85,,
321,0.97,2558.222,2570.401,I will echo one of the previous comments that our group in particular is frustrated with the process and I think there's a lot of variation from DRV to DRV.,85,,
322,0.97,2570.401,2582.046,Some are great and willing to work with developers that are trying to create housing in the city and others are very difficult to work with and seem to take on their own Agendas.,85,,
323,0.97,2582.046,2592.222,For the first time in 20 years it now takes longer to entitle a project than it does to build it and that really is compounding our housing crisis.,85,,
324,0.97,2592.222,2624.888,On the front of the DRV process being continued for private development not for affordable I'd like to ask Council to really consider all of the projects now are often including Mha are paying a fee and are incentive zoning so in a way all of the projects are creating affordable housing and also with benefit from a break in the process that would speed up that time that is now approaching two years to entitle.,85,,
325,0.97,2624.888,2627.391,I do support the virtual DRV.,85,,
326,0.97,2627.391,2633.53,However we did have a project go through the process and truly allowed us to stream line it.,85,,
327,0.97,2633.53,2646.076,Working with the staff I think the result of the design is just as good as something that went through DRV and received.,85,,
328,0.97,2646.076,2647.811,Thank you Brian.,86,,
329,0.97,2647.811,2658.055,My apologize for this pronouncing the last name I now had it down.,86,,
330,0.97,2658.055,2659.423,My apologies.,86,,
331,0.97,2659.423,2663.694,Please do feel free to send us written comments we can reflect in the record.,86,,
332,0.97,2663.694,2665.896,Annie I still don't see you're present.,86,,
333,0.97,2665.896,2668.799,Michael I saw you sign up and you have since disappeared.,86,,
334,0.97,2668.799,2671.802,Up next is Megan Cruz and Deb Barker.,86,,
335,0.97,2671.802,2681.512,And again Megan my apologies for missing you at the out set.,86,,
336,0.97,2681.512,2682.079,Good morning.,87,,
337,0.97,2682.079,2699.163,I'm like the others calling to support virtual design review and ask that the Council up hold the original legislation that the market rate projects return from ADR to the new public format.,87,,
338,0.97,2699.163,2730.661,However Cb119877 inserts two So- called minor changes to negate the ordinance and allow market rate projects to remain in internal review act of public participation originally framed that would expedite affordable housing and did that prompting 70 new market rate permits and 11 affordable housing projects so continue the market rate through the end of the year the ADR for market rate.,87,,
339,0.97,2730.661,2739.269,Yesterday Council member Strauss' office suggested that if projects don't continue in the track it will wipe out gains and they could even have to restart the process.,87,,
340,0.97,2739.269,2748.345,I'd like to point out nothing of this kind was indicated in the original bill or the recent reports by staff.,87,,
341,0.97,2748.345,2754.818,Each notice for the project States it is temporary followed by the statement I understand this project will review board.,87,,
342,0.97,2754.818,2756.987,It couldn't be clearer.,87,,
343,0.97,2756.987,2773.07,One proposed exemption is based on whether they could provide a virtual meeting suggesting the calendar was full and yesterday's review calendar showed now through October and the end of the year if projects are ready to go why aren't these taken.,87,,
344,0.97,2773.07,2781.378,Three projects are listed as continuing the ADR only filing their notice in August and September after virtual design reviews in place.,87,,
345,0.97,2781.378,2793.157,For projects that still need a design review meeting there's no good reason to change the game now and continue suspending input F█Rom a design review board and project neighbors.,87,,
346,0.97,2793.157,2798.629,"Council members please hold your pledge, amend this bill in terms of the notice sent to the public.",87,,
347,0.97,2798.629,2801.732,Thank you.,87,,
348,0.97,2801.732,2804.301,Thank you Megan.,88,,
349,0.97,2804.301,2805.068,.,88,,
350,0.97,2805.068,2813.744,Up next Deb Barker and Annie we don't see you are present still.,89,,
351,0.97,2813.744,2814.611,Hello again Council members.,90,,

353,0.97,2819.349,2844.241,I am speaking about 119877 and Sibs I already had an opportunity to tell you my experience design review all I'm going to do is say listen again to what Megan Cruz said because I completely 100% agree with her comments.,90,,
354,0.97,2844.241,2851.315,Stand your ground hold your line and keep promotions.,90,,
355,0.97,2851.315,2851.849,Thank you.,90,,
356,0.97,2851.849,2852.716,.,90,,
357,0.97,2852.716,2853.183,Thaives Deb.,91,,
358,0.97,2853.183,2856.954,Always wonderful to hear from you.,91,,
359,0.97,2856.954,2859.723,And I look forward to meeting with you as well.,91,,
360,0.97,2859.723,2869.733,Annie though are you present?,91,,
361,0.97,2869.733,2874.137,"It, can you con firm.",91,,
362,0.97,2874.137,2875.239,"Affirmative, not present.",92,,
363,0.97,2875.239,2875.606,Thank you.,93,,
364,0.97,2875.606,2880.377,That was our last Speaker remotely present to speak at the public hearing.,93,,
365,0.97,2880.377,2884.414,Public hearing on Cp119877 is now closed.,93,,
366,0.97,2884.414,2894.157,Thank you for everyone who provided comment today.,93,,
367,0.97,2894.157,2909.473,At this time I'd like to discuss amendment 1. you gave us a little briefing and we will.,93,,
368,0.97,2909.473,2910.474,Sure.,94,,
369,0.97,2910.474,2953.784,So to refresh your memory this is a procedural amendment in part that clarifies the authority under which of the continuing exemption would be enacted part of the authority for procedural purposes the amendment adds a new section that makes findings of fact related to the Covid-19 pandemic and findings of facts support a state environmental policy act procedural exemption so an emergency exemption for the affordable housing exemption from design review and also includes a Severability clause so this is an amendment specific to the portions of the bill that exempt portable housing projects.,94,,
370,0.97,2953.784,2966.63,Thank you and this amendment adds a new finding to the bill does not change policy impacts and provides additional background for why this bill is necessary.,95,,
371,0.97,2966.63,2970.567,Is that a correct understanding?,95,,
372,0.97,2970.567,2971.935,"That's correct, Yeah.",96,,
373,0.97,2971.935,2972.469,Thank you.,97,,
374,0.97,2972.469,2979.843,Do you have questions regarding amendment number 1? wonderful.,97,,
375,0.97,2979.843,2995.392,If there's no further discussion I will now move amendment one to Cb119877 as shown in amendment one on the agenda.,97,,
376,0.97,2995.392,2995.692,Second.,98,,
377,0.97,2995.692,2995.992,Second.,99,,
378,0.97,2995.992,3001.832,It has been moved and Seconded to amend Council bill as reflected in amendment one.,100,,

382,0.97,3011.241,3011.708,Yes.,103,,
383,0.97,3011.708,3013.11,Mosqueda.,104,,
384,0.97,3013.11,3013.443,Yes.,105,,
385,0.97,3013.443,3013.744,Strauss.,106,,

387,0.97,3013.977,3014.711,Four in favor.,108,,
388,0.97,3014.711,3016.213,Thank you.,109,,
389,0.97,3016.213,3030.594,The motion carries and I realize I was Remissed I need to move also the second amendment for discussion so I would like to move amendment 2 as shown on the agenda.,109,,
390,0.97,3030.594,3034.03,Is there a second?,109,,
391,0.97,3034.03,3034.398,Second.,110,,
392,0.97,3034.398,3034.831,Thank you.,111,,
393,0.97,3034.831,3077.407,I was happy to work with Council member Lewis on this amendment shortening the sunset date of the legislation from six months after the end of Covid emergency down to two months after the Covid emergency I heard from community members this would be more appropriate with the legislation and I agree that we understand that includes could end at any time state emergency that is which is a legal procedure and for us to be able to pass legislation that will take and for it to become effective will take about two months which is Quhsm down to two months.,111,,
394,0.97,3077.407,3084.147,Six months an applicable amount of time depending on the different variables in the environment at the end of the Covid emergency.,111,,
395,0.97,3084.147,3089.719,In two months really is the minimum.,111,,
396,0.97,3089.719,3093.857,So so Council member Lewis do you have any comments on this amendment.,111,,
397,0.97,3093.857,3094.124,Yes.,112,,
398,0.97,3094.124,3103.8,Thank you Mr. chair and again it was good to work with your office on preparing this amendment and community members who brought this idea forward.,112,,
399,0.97,3103.8,3125.555,I think it's important for us to remember this is emergency temporary legislation there's a lot of people in the community who want to engage in a broader litigation of design review that is in the context of this emergency legislation and I'm not Commenting at all on the merits of Thao debate.,112,,
400,0.97,3125.555,3177.307,I think it's certainly worthy to have design review and some of the people who called and alluded to some of the policy arguments in favor of stream lining design review or potentially eliminating entirely and we can have that discussion but I think for this bill I'd rather keep it centered to exactly what we're doing which is emergency legislation to respond to the unique challenges of Covid and adapt for this window our design review practices in that spirit I think this amendment that we worked on is really good at making sure that we snap back to the old in person design review meetings as quickly as possible once the Covid matter is over.,112,,
401,0.97,3177.307,3185.715,I don't see why we have to have a long buffer Peeferred in what is in the current bill to string out how long the new remote process would run.,112,,
402,0.97,3185.715,3208.939,You know if the Mayor has declared an end to the Covid state of emergency presumably we are good for a broader reopening of the economy potentially if the situation is different we could Revisit this but I think for right now it is my preference that we plan on snapping back to the way that this has been working as quickly as possible.,112,,
403,0.97,3208.939,3222.953,I don't think a six month extension of the virtual meeting would be desirable so definitely voting for this amendment.,112,,
404,0.97,3222.953,3224.854,Thank you Council member Lewis.,113,,
405,0.97,3224.854,3226.056,Vice chair Mosqueda.,113,,
406,0.97,3226.056,3228.091,Thank you very much Mr.,114,,
407,0.97,3228.091,3228.358,Chair.,114,,
408,0.97,3228.358,3231.828,Thank you as well Council member Strauss for that explanation.,114,,
409,0.97,3231.828,3237.4,I'm not going to be opposed to this amendment but I do want to raise a few concerns for the record.,114,,
410,0.97,3237.4,3269.866,As we know Covid is continuing to expose new trades and new consequences as people who have survived Covid have on going crisis and continue to get Reinfected again we are learning more and more about this disease as time goes on so my main concern is just the on going uncertainty about the disease in general the civil emergency yes if it was lifted I think the question is is the crisis really over would it be totally gone?,114,,
411,0.97,3269.866,3315.445,Probably not and I think it's really important that we recognize that there is not going to be a snapping back to normal as we heard from the director of public health last week there is not going to be a returning to normal so really important to continue to monitor whether or not there's behavior changes in the community at large whether or not people take this experience and actually change their behaviors to limit transmission of any diseases or any type of others that come into the future but I think it's fair to say that technically a declared state of emergency might not actually be over even if the emergency is lifted.,114,,
412,0.97,3315.445,3329.059,"I think the implications could be two fold for the community if it is harder for us to get volunteers to back in person I worry that people might self select those who have under lying health conditions, those who might be elderly.",114,,
413,0.97,3329.059,3354.484,Are they going to limit their participation in volunteer board rooms that are often enclosed and I don't want us to screen out board members who might not be allowed to come to such a Venue because they're going to be self screening themselves out if their health is a problem.,114,,
414,0.97,3354.484,3375.739,"And then second I worry about whether or not there's trouble filling the board themselves if there's people who sit out of the opportunity to participate on these volunteer boards would Sdci I have a problem filling the spots and what happens if there's vacancies all at once piling up, are we going to have projects waiting?",114,,
415,0.97,3375.739,3390.32,I raise these concerns because I just don't Wafnt us to be in a situation where we've unintentionally weeded out certain volunteers because of the risk evaluation that they're doing and wanted to put that out there.,114,,
416,0.97,3390.32,3402.265,I know we evaluate as we move forward and I know we're all working in real-time to address this crisis.,114,,
417,0.97,3402.265,3428.258,None of these concerns mean I won't be versus a shorter Timeframe and wanted to put on the record as we continue to look for healthy opportunities for people to engage in this important work but also wanted to protect the health and especially not limit who is participating in these boards in the future so supporting the amendment but I wanted to make sure we raise these and follow up with Sdci.,114,,
418,0.97,3428.258,3437.467,Looking like the emergency civil emergency is going to be lifted.,114,,
419,0.97,3437.467,3438.067,Thank you.,115,,
420,0.97,3438.067,3443.807,Your comments are very well received and what I discussed with Sdci.,115,,
421,0.97,3443.807,3457.987,Feel free to jump in or at least for that matter there is Aeight greatest benefit of virtual meetings for people who can't physically attend and also the benefit of in person meetings so people can attend in person.,115,,
422,0.97,3457.987,3507.804,One of the design reviews is it's done in an area the meetings are completed in areas near the project and so some of the rooms that are traditionally used for design review may not be set-up for the needs that are required to do virtual design reviews so there are I hate the term new normal but as we transition out of this Covid emergency there will be changes on how being able to ensure that everyone is able to participate in a meaningful way virtually and in person is a policy goal that I hold.,115,,
423,0.97,3507.804,3521.951,Could you remind me what would need to take place whether or not we're making larger changes like in person and virtual meetings just from a baseline policy standpoint what would need to take place in those 60 days?,116,,
424,0.97,3521.951,3543.806,Thank you for that question and a point of Clarks the option to elect administrative design review or the continuing to be processed ends actually at the end of the year.,117,,
425,0.97,3543.806,3586.783,The extension beyond the end of the Covid-19 emergency for 180 days or 60 days amendment passes likes to other aspects of the bill so administrative review of historic preservation modifications for example extend 180 days or 60 days and also importantly the design review exemption for affordable housing extends past the end of the civil emergency however the administrative design review option desires sooner than that on December 31.,117,,
426,0.97,3586.783,3604.734,Your question--so I think You- -Maybe I'm not sure are you asking sort of what would need to happen for the Council to consider more permanent modifications to the design review what is the Timeframe for enacting that.,117,,
427,0.97,3604.734,3615.411,Yes and/or extending this what we understand to be a temporary bill that is not necessarily tied to the Covid civil emergency because.,118,,
428,0.97,3615.411,3615.945,Yeah.,119,,
429,0.97,3615.945,3622.251,So again thank you for the opportunity to clarify.,119,,
430,0.97,3622.251,3641.304,But the current bill and a charter emergency nor is it being the authority that the growth management Act provides for interim development standards those authorities ordinance 126072 are not being invoked here.,119,,
431,0.97,3641.304,3655.885,There is an emergency aspect to this bill that has to do with the findings of the community recommending approval of a procedural emergency for the purposes of review one particular component of this bill.,119,,
432,0.97,3655.885,3678.775,This bill is being enacted under the normal procedures for making any kind of modification to t land use code under review has to happen and the bill currently is procedural changes the bill that's in front of you is necessarily required for those.,119,,
433,0.97,3678.775,3693.056,Professional determination has to be published and a public hearing has to be and all of that is what goes along with any change to land use code and those are the procedures for this particular change in the code.,119,,
434,0.97,3693.056,3720.983,If the Council wanted to consider more permanent changes procedures or design review procedures it would follow the same process there would need to be a threshold determination once after the bill is introduced there needs to be an opportunity for a public hearing in 30 days notice in advance of the public hearing.,119,,
435,0.97,3720.983,3750.613,Generally two months is tight but is possible if it's required has been done and the legislation is good to go at that future date when the Mayor that's a Timeframe usually for Council consideration of any land use bill two to three months.,119,,
436,0.97,3750.613,3787.717,Just going back on the particular authority enacting this ordinance just Clairvetion is it because back in the spring we had fewer tools as the governor's order I don't want folks to get the impression we are not responding to unique circumstances but we have more tools now because of the broader governor order from the spring which is why we're doing it this way I just want to clarify that's the case.,120,,
437,0.97,3787.717,3824.82,Yes but there are more tools there were prescriptions on what actions could even be considered by a legislative body under the governor's orders back in the spring but also I think a changed circumstance here is that There- -As we know more I guess about the Covid-19 pan demonstration IC the interim provisions the authored that would be the Council cannot do that indefinitely and only for six months.,121,,
438,0.97,3824.82,3846.876,We don't know how long the Covid-19 civil emergency is going to last and so the choice to use this tool and I think I can let Sdci or speak to the choice reflects the uncertainty about when we may be out of the Covid-19 pandemic and can return to normal.,121,,
439,0.97,3846.876,3848.11,Thank you.,122,,
440,0.97,3848.11,3848.945,Thank you.,123,,
441,0.97,3848.945,3850.947,Council member Pedersen.,123,,
442,0.97,3850.947,3880.643,Thank you and I appreciate your putting forward this amendment to shorten the Timeframe I wanted to--I can just make my comments I do have a question so I'll be supporting this amendment but I do have concerns about the bill as a whole since I voted against the version that we had originally back in April so it would be inconsistent for me to vote this one but I want to understand something.,124,,
443,0.97,3880.643,3900.73,In your memo to us you had written that at the initial briefing the committee asks for more Dale on the number of projects and then you had put together a map more details of the projects and have those been answered?,124,,
444,0.97,3900.73,3905.067,You will have to refresh my memory or I can go back and look at the video.,125,,
445,0.97,3905.067,3923.619,There was some questions about which projects would benefit from the extension and maybe I can share my screen so we can take a look at the map here that might help.,125,,
446,0.97,3923.619,3959.956,The neighborhoods trying to understand I thought that use this time period the executive was going to use this time period to figure out how they could potentially do this virtually the volume of documents but they were going to use this time to actually figure out how to do it and now I just want to better understand are they going to figure that out to do it virtually or are they justice waiting for the Covid pandemic to end what's the plan for the executive here the screen on the map.,126,,
447,0.97,3959.956,3964.393,Sure and maybe pivot to that quickly before showing you the map.,127,,
448,0.97,3964.393,3968.331,I think we heard from that they are doing it virtually.,127,,
449,0.97,3968.331,3977.84,They have the capacity now to have virtual design board members can speak to that.,127,,
450,0.97,3977.84,3981.344,There are some Lodgist capital challenges with that.,127,,
451,0.97,3981.344,3994.724,Let me share the screen here so this is a map thanks again to are you all seeing that?,127,,
452,0.97,3994.724,3996.692,It's a map that's hard to read.,128,,
453,0.97,3996.692,3998.728,I can zoom in on parts of it.,128,,
454,0.97,3998.728,4028.19,I can show where the projects are for administrative design review and where they are in the phase of in the design review program so if there is a white DOT not without a dot in the middle of it that's a project that's in early design guidance if there is a dot in the middle of it that's a project that has had an initial early design guidance meeting scheduled for a second early design guidance meeting.,128,,
455,0.97,4028.19,4029.458,If it's a.,128,,
456,0.97,4029.458,4031.694,Can you zoom in?,129,,
457,0.97,4031.694,4033.362,Yeah sure.,130,,
458,0.97,4033.362,4033.796,.,130,,
459,0.97,4033.796,4034.196,Sorry.,131,,
460,0.97,4034.196,4039.535,We did have this on our Inbox.,131,,
461,0.97,4039.535,4039.802,Yeah.,132,,
462,0.97,4039.802,4054.417,This actually is probably most of the projects are in the downtown corridor and university district so if it's a project that has shown in reddish orange that's a project that is in the recommendation phase.,132,,
463,0.97,4054.417,4072.935,And if there's a reddish orange with the DOT in it that means one initial recommendation Úmeeting and have a second recommendation meeting scheduled so if I'm Miss characterizing any of this Lisa something I'm getting wrong please do Chime in.,132,,
464,0.97,4072.935,4107.169,You can see where most of these projects are these are projects that are primarily in the downtown design review board district and queen Ann design review board district because that covers the Capitol Hill first Hill review district obviously that's and the University district so about 67 projects total but have opted for administrative design review does that help answer your question Council member Pedersen?,132,,
465,0.97,4107.169,4107.403,Yes.,133,,
466,0.97,4107.403,4126.822,And Lisa and Mike I don't know if there's anything you want to say about kind of virtual meetings and how that process is rolling out and whether there are any capacity constraints and if those can be addressed.,134,,
467,0.97,4126.822,4127.456,Thank you.,135,,
468,0.97,4127.456,4135.131,This is Lisa and I manage the design Department of construction and inspections.,135,,
469,0.97,4135.131,4143.305,As et O said they're through the course of the emergency election there were 67 projects that opted into administrative design review.,135,,
470,0.97,4143.305,4151.78,Of those 20 of them were in the early design guidance phase and of those 15 completed their early design guidance.,135,,
471,0.97,4151.78,4164.226,So what that means Shh that those 15 projects would be allowed to stay within the administrative design review track with the legislation through the end of this year.,135,,
472,0.97,4164.226,4168.264,All of the OJ Protds need to revert back to board review.,135,,
473,0.97,4168.264,4211.941,"We have started conducting virtual board meetings that began on August 1 for early design guidance projects and starting October 1 we're including all projects in the recommendation phase so we are fully equipped and running virtual meetings so from this point on there's really no reason we would need to use the virtual meeting--I'm sorry, to use the administrative design review opt in unless for some reason the technology fails and we lose the ability to do virtual meetings but I don't anticipate that happening.",135,,
474,0.97,4211.941,4213.208,Thank you Lisa.,136,,
475,0.97,4213.208,4214.043,Council member Pedersen.,137,,
476,0.97,4214.043,4215.244,That's very helpful.,138,,
477,0.97,4215.244,4217.413,And I apologize if this is already provided.,138,,
478,0.97,4217.413,4226.689,Do we have a list of those 15 projects that are Benefiting- -That would be benefiting from this legislation?,138,,
479,0.97,4226.689,4234.063,I provided that data to et O last week and it's I'm sure it's embedded in the data that informed that map.,139,,
480,0.97,4234.063,4234.93,It is.,140,,
481,0.97,4234.93,4253.248,I'm happy to E-mail it and I can right now just so it's available to you Burt it's reflected in the map.,140,,
482,0.97,4253.248,4254.116,Thank you.,141,,
483,0.97,4254.116,4254.483,Thank you.,142,,
484,0.97,4254.483,4255.918,Any other questions.,142,,
485,0.97,4255.918,4291.153,One thing I heard in our previous discussions that three months is most optimal for the period after the civil emergency legal status of the civil emergency is ends and so two months is cutting it tight and so I would like to let the record reflect I would like to work with you in advance of the end of the stated civil emergency to have the necessary items in place so that we are able to move quickly if and when that stated civil emergency ends.,143,,
486,0.97,4291.153,4293.022,Sure.,144,,
487,0.97,4293.022,4305.734,That's duly noted so Teeing up a conversation that will happen this fall I think that is what that implies is a different policy approach to some of the processes that are required in person meetings now.,144,,
488,0.97,4305.734,4318.747,And so that is a work program potentially for Sdci and DOM and you may want to consider how you secure resources for the program going into budget deliberations this fall.,144,,
489,0.97,4318.747,4334.697,I think one reason why six months was proposed by Sdci is it provided maximum flexibility for resolving reviews of projects that were in the pipeline.,144,,
490,0.97,4334.697,4338.534,That's a pretty broad window.,144,,
491,0.97,4338.534,4345.874,So against the desire by someone on the Council to shorten that.,144,,
492,0.97,4345.874,4346.909,Thank you.,145,,
493,0.97,4346.909,4348.544,Duly noted.,145,,

568,0.97,4866.628,4900.428,"The state law allows the city to in general make changes once per year to the comprehensive plan for quite a while now the city has laid out a process of Docketing possible Upleanedments altogether the beginning of an annual cycle having this go through consideration and Rougeses of Council that has happened and after those come back in there's a recommendation from your staff like me, the planning Commission and also op CD and there's a public hearing on September 9 as you know because you were there you held the public hearing on this bill.",190,,

570,0.97,4906.368,4922.183,The bill itself would do these things amending the boundary of the West Seattle junction Hobbish and village to include the Providence Mount property and would update the del ridge neighborhood plan goals and policies so it's a quick run down and happy to answer any questions about that.,190,,

594,0.97,5006.868,5007.335,Vice chair Mosqueda.,203,,
595,0.97,5007.335,5008.269,Thank you very much Mr.,204,,
596,0.97,5008.269,5008.536,Chair.,204,,
597,0.97,5008.536,5019.114,I'm hoping to get a few answers to questions we asked at the meeting last week the last meeting we had.,204,,
598,0.97,5019.114,5031.292,We know there's a lot at this committee Council last week that there be the inclusion of the Renaming of single family zones and this year's comprehensive plan as a minor update.,204,,
599,0.97,5031.292,5052.213,I know that this discussion was shared by members of the planning Commission who also joined and housing advocates and many community members who had written in given the name single family is ant equated and accurate and Council member Weiss accurately pointed out in our last committee does not reflect the diverse multi generational housing that exists in our city.,204,,
600,0.97,5052.213,5060.655,It's pastime to update this language and include a more accurate name such Aves neighborhood residential as has been suggested.,204,,
601,0.97,5060.655,5063.858,My desire was to include that change in this legislation.,204,,
602,0.97,5063.858,5078.239,We've requested op CD to study the name change in 2018 in the MH Aof course companion resolution and again during the comprehensive plan annual documenting process in 2019 and we know this change has been recommended by the planning Commission as I mentioned.,204,,
603,0.97,5078.239,5084.212,Unfortunately this change has not been studied by the executive and therefore we are not able to include it in this year's update.,204,,
604,0.97,5084.212,5111.773,You'll see that the name change is again docketed for a third time and the next piece of legislation for consideration as an Amendnd next year's plan update again this is a minor change that would go far in updating how we talk about housing in Seattle to be more inclusive and equitable and I think that this change squarely fits into the minor updates and should ot wait until the next major comprehensive update which would not be until 2024.,204,,
605,0.97,5111.773,5121.583,So I'm really disappointed that we are not moving forward with this change this year but I look forward to having it studied so we can finally make progress on something that we should have had disposition to do last year.,204,,
606,0.97,5121.583,5126.254,Those are my comments but I just want to ask a question on the record.,204,,
607,0.97,5126.254,5136.798,Why can't we do this this year?,204,,
608,0.97,5137.365,5138.666,Why?,205,,
609,0.97,5138.666,5143.438,Would you like to take that?,206,,
610,0.97,5143.438,5147.942,Central staff basically environmental review has not been done on that change.,207,,
611,0.97,5147.942,5161.189,We're still trying to identify whether environmental review is required but the necessary analysis and public notice hasn't been provided.,207,,
612,0.97,5161.189,5179.44,Can I ask one more question about that and it's dangerous to ask questions that I have not asked central staff in advance so you're saying that we need an environmental review assessment to change the language that we use and not change the actual zoning requirements that accompany that.,208,,
613,0.97,5179.44,5187.115,"We know that over the last century single family zoning has expanded out, out, out.",208,,
614,0.97,5187.115,5197.992,So many apartments multi family structures are included in single family zones that are just Mislabeled or I would say now prohibited in those zones.,208,,
615,0.97,5197.992,5207.835,We've seen those maps over and over where the size of the single family home zoning has been broadened out and effectively reducing the areas in which we could have multi family structures.,208,,
616,0.97,5207.835,5223.651,We are just talking about more adequately or more accurately Renaming a zone that is not actually reflecting the current fabric of those neighborhoods so that requires an environmental study.,208,,
617,0.97,5223.651,5238.733,So Unfortunately we don't actually have a proposal for what Expesk changes would be required once we have that proposal then we would analyze whether or not environmental review was required.,209,,
618,0.97,5238.733,5258.319,The world of land use is full of process and analysis and opportunity for public input and so it is likely that this change could require environmental review but we don't have a proposal to actually make that determination at this point.,209,,
619,0.97,5258.319,5264.192,Thank you Mr. chair and I'm happy to follow up with you Úafterwards Mr. chair and with our team from central staff.,210,,
620,0.97,5264.192,5294.088,I just want to note what I think I heard that in order for a zone that has very minor impact I would say Renaming from single family to neighborhood residential for example first would require a proposal then it would require an analysis of whether or not we need an environmental review analysis then it would require an environmental review and then it would have to come back for us in that potentially consider an act.,210,,
621,0.97,5294.088,5297.625,Right including public hearing.,211,,
622,0.97,5297.625,5297.892,Sure.,212,,
623,0.97,5297.892,5298.593,Yeah.,213,,
624,0.97,5298.593,5300.662,And just one last point of Clarks.,214,,
625,0.97,5300.662,5313.408,The planning Commission itself do we know if they have put forward any proposal that meets that required first step?,214,,
626,0.97,5313.408,5324.452,So they have not actually sort of marked up the plan to identify what changes would be required or the necessary code amendments that would flow from any changes to the complex.,215,,
627,0.97,5324.452,5337.332,So we have a concept right now that certainly Merritts study but we haven't gotten to the next step of actually developing a proposal that can be analyzed.,215,,
628,0.97,5337.332,5340.468,Mr. chair may I ask one more question?,216,,
629,0.97,5340.468,5340.735,Sorry.,217,,
630,0.97,5340.735,5341.969,That's okay.,218,,
631,0.97,5341.969,5342.87,Hi puppy.,218,,
632,0.97,5342.87,5354.649,Is it your understanding then that it is more complicated than literally striking the word single family and adding the words neighborhood residential?,218,,
633,0.97,5354.649,5372.166,I think that is all that this proposal has asked for but we've been advised by our attorneys that we really need to see what the changes are before we can determine whether or not environmental review is required.,219,,
634,0.97,5372.166,5372.533,Okay.,220,,
635,0.97,5372.533,5405.833,Very disappointing that Ttdz that custom number some I think to make what is by all Intents and purposes from the common sense perspective a minor change to the wording in the way in which our terminology and the alphabet soup that excludes folks that is excluding people so looking forward to hearing more about the barriers and as you can tell a call for us to act with urgency as we know that this has been studied and demanded for a long time.,220,,
636,0.97,5405.833,5407.101,Thank you Mr. chair.,220,,
637,0.97,5407.101,5424.919,Thank you vice chair and it is also my understanding that such a name change would not have a policy location rather than just simply calling a neighborhood what it truly is which is neighborhood residential.,221,,
638,0.97,5424.919,5429.257,Prine you raising this and happy to follow up at any time regarding this item.,221,,

685,0.97,5707.768,5713.34,I have a couple questions I'll start just with one then I'll open it up to the colleagues.,237,,
686,0.97,5713.34,5723.651,Does the docket as Descriend in this resolution differ from op CD where the planning Commission's recommendations?,237,,

692,0.97,5756.217,5756.584,Vice chair?,240,,
693,0.97,5756.584,5757.651,Thank you so much.,241,,
694,0.97,5757.651,5777.505,I will say one more time for the record my sincere interest in making sure that we can continue to advance the conversation around Renaming single family zones per the comments I just made a second ago related to this year's comprehensive plan minor update legislation.,241,,
695,0.97,5777.505,5786.747,I want to again thank Council chair and Council member Strauss for including the single family name change in this resolution requesting to study this change for next year's adoption.,241,,
696,0.97,5786.747,5802.897,I hope it's the third time will be the charm and we will finally be able to work with central staff to make sure we don't let yet another year go by without addressing the name change that would exist within our own planning document Eaves.,241,,
697,0.97,5802.897,5842.57,The determine single family is rooted in exclusion and does not accurately reflect the diverse array of housing arrangements to Inducive group housing to the apartments like in queen Ann that was located in a single family zone and it's important for us to have language that is inclusive and Rflective in the different ways that live together and so let's get this done and see if we actually need to do this environmental review study or not and then let's move forward to make it a more inclusive Seattle.,241,,
698,0.97,5842.57,5843.27,Thank you.,241,,
699,0.97,5843.27,5888.249,Thank you vice chair and your comments reflected something I spoke to a landlord from Ballard about where they owned a duplex which is now in a single family zone because much of before single family zoning was made more restrictive there are many Duplexes and Triplexes throughout Ballard and throughout Seattle that are now in single family zones and so this landlord was looking to make modest improvements to their building however they were unable to have the permitting done completed because they're building was out of Complines with the zoning.,242,,
700,0.97,5888.249,5896.523,That is separate from just speaking to the name of the neighborhood residential and I do think that both need to be addressed.,242,,
701,0.97,5896.523,5899.56,So thank you vice chair for bringing that up.,242,,
702,0.97,5899.56,5907.668,Any other comments from my colleagues?,242,,
703,0.97,5907.668,5926.186,"And one of my questions, dove tails, is maybe Lisch are there any other thoughts that you would like to share with us to remind us why we are constrained from considering that change this Ynoa anything additional that you would like to share with us?",242,,
704,0.97,5926.186,5926.587,No.,243,,
705,0.97,5926.587,5927.454,Thank you.,243,,

709,0.97,5939.433,5954.281,So op CD will analyze the amend Mantles maybe performing on each of these amendments and will develop a package that will go forward for environmental review.,245,,
710,0.97,5954.281,5963.09,There will be a determination of whether the proposed amendments are significant in terms of environmental review.,245,,
711,0.97,5963.09,6003.197,There's an opportunity for members of the public to challenge that ferment it is determined to be non significant then the executive recommendations are proposed to be sent--requested to be sent back to Council by the end of March at which point the Commission is given a couple of months to review and make recommendations on the package that the executive testified to.,245,,
712,0.97,6003.197,6003.864,Thank you.,246,,
713,0.97,6003.864,6005.499,Any other comments.,246,,
714,0.97,6005.499,6006.533,Lewis then Pedersen.,246,,
715,0.97,6006.533,6018.178,What are the nature of some of the objections that you mentioned earlier related to the West Seattle bridge related matters?,247,,
716,0.97,6018.178,6020.047,You said O P CD was opposed.,247,,
717,0.97,6020.047,6023.05,I just want to touch on that real quick.,247,,
718,0.97,6023.05,6024.585,I'm just kind of curious.,247,,
719,0.97,6024.585,6047.674,The proposal that was put forward was really focused on land use issues in West Seattle and the impacts of the bridge closure on land use in West Seattle with view towards determining whether or not there should be a moratorium on development or other changes.,248,,
720,0.97,6047.674,6053.914,And development in West Seattle because of the bridge as drafted.,248,,
721,0.97,6053.914,6088.248,The resolution instead is more focused on looking at the transportation element and the maps in the transportation element to make sure that for example bus routes and freight routes in that element are appropriate and that reflect current developments with how bus and freight are moving through and to and from the West Seattle Peninsula with the bridge down.,248,,
722,0.97,6088.248,6098.425,And I think op CD is more comfortable with that approach and look than with the original proposal.,248,,
723,0.97,6098.425,6101.995,"So sorry, now I'm confused a little.",249,,
724,0.97,6101.995,6107.601,So are there in favor Rfer Tbens this particular proposal then.,249,,
725,0.97,6107.601,6120.247,I think they are more comfortable with the resolution than the proposal that was originally sited.,250,,
726,0.97,6120.247,6120.514,Okay.,251,,
727,0.97,6120.514,6122.916,Appreciate that clarification.,251,,

731,0.97,6131.325,6158.819,We did hear comments today from Steve and Rereading what's in the resolution I feel like that could incorporate what he was talking about over the specifics but I just wanted to thank you for being mindful of trees in this particular piece of legislation.,253,,
732,0.97,6158.819,6183.51,Also I heard Chris talking about the transportation concerns the vehicles on the roads and damage to the roads and we'll be EEP to looking into that further it doesn't necessarily have to be through that particular piece of legislation but just want to let them know that I hear his concerns.,253,,
733,0.97,6183.51,6183.944,Thank you.,253,,
734,0.97,6183.944,6193.053,Thank you and I will be reaching out to you about some of those changes to the amendment.,254,,
735,0.97,6193.053,6225.419,Also Council member Lewis just going down the land use the history of land Ughs the Seattle municipal archives has a wonderful page dedicated to the Annexation of West Seattle which occurred in 1907 may 25 that year both Ballard and Bryant were also Annexed into the city of Seattle and that's when the first flurry of development really expanded beyond what the original settlers there had built.,254,,
736,0.97,6225.419,6226.253,So relevant information.,254,,
737,0.97,6226.253,6234.861,Check it out on the Seattle municipal Archive site.,254,,
738,0.97,6234.861,6236.096,Any further discussion?,254,,

758,0.97,6284.211,6302.996,I just wanted to note that our colleague Council member Juarez is also not here today sending her a note of appreciation of solidarity and support I understand there were folks outside her house again last night I know that other Council members including Pedersen and members of their family Mr.,267,,
759,0.97,6302.996,6305.532,Chair have also experienced similar types of protests.,267,,
760,0.97,6305.532,6307.601,I've also had meme come to my door.,267,,
761,0.97,6307.601,6319.446,What happened at Council member Juarez's house as I understand it using profanity screaming names at her that are violent and sexual nature.,267,,
762,0.97,6319.446,6352.679,"Afned as representative Acastro Cortez said in her comments in D.C. we cannot let people continue to use those terms against any woman, any person and we cannot also make a discrepancy between whether or not it's people we agree with or disagree with so my heart to the world please stop that type of harassing behavior especially when we are calling out that type of intimidation that's being used and sexually violent language.",267,,
763,0.97,6352.679,6353.58,It is not okay.,267,,
